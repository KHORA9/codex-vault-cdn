But coming forward as I\r\ndo, an unknown contributor to the stock of general knowledge, I am\r\npeculiarly happy in having so high a passport to the notice of the\r\nPublic, in a Work which professes to communicate new information\r\nrespecting a portion of South America, now more than ever interesting\r\nto the commercial, political, and scientific worlds. Whatever faults\r\nit possesses, the pains I have taken to obtain authentic information\r\nwill, I trust, render it not unworthy of their and your Lordship’s\r\nnotice. If the style in which I present the new fruit, gathered from\r\nthe branches of the tree of knowledge that are spread in a far country,\r\nis not considered interesting, the fruit itself will be found, I hope,\r\nacceptable and useful.\r\n\r\n                   I have the honour to subscribe myself,\r\n\r\n                                      MY LORD,\r\n\r\n                            Your Lordship’s most faithful and\r\n                                       devoted Servant,\r\n\r\n                                                    JAMES HENDERSON.\r\n\r\n   _London, August 1, 1821._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NOTICE TO THE READER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this Work is to describe the state of the Brazil, from\r\nits first discovery down to the present time;--to trace distinctly\r\nthe boundaries of the twenty-two provinces which it comprises, their\r\nsub-divisions into comarcas or districts, and their rivers; to\r\nenumerate the povoaçoes or establishments in each province, consisting\r\nof cities, towns, (and the dates they were so erected by his present\r\nMajesty, or previously,) _freguezias_, (parishes,) _arraials_,\r\n_aldeias_, (villages,) _presidios_, (garrisons,) hermitages, &c.\r\nwith the nature of their agricultural productions, the composition\r\nof their inhabitants, whether whites, mulattos, mamalucos, mesticos,\r\nChristianized Indians, or Africans.\r\n\r\nThe numerous tribes of savage Indians, still existing in this region\r\nare also described; with the mountains, minerals, and leading objects\r\nin the animal and vegetable worlds. The state of the government,\r\nrevenue, society, and minor subjects are investigated, and more\r\nparticularly the present commercial relations between Great Britain and\r\nthe Brazil. The friendly assistance I experienced from many persons\r\nin South America, as well as from some governors and ex-governors of\r\nprovinces, has furnished a portion of the authentic materials of the\r\nWork.\r\n\r\nMy first intention in undertaking it was to have adhered to a\r\ngeographical and commercial account of the country, but as the recent\r\npublication of Padre Manoel Ayres de Cazal, (in producing which he\r\nhad been many years engaged,) furnishing me, not only with copious\r\ninformation upon the first subject, but also upon its history, civil\r\nand natural, I conceived that it would not be unacceptable to the\r\nBritish reader to give an abridged account of each province, from\r\ntheir first colonization, combined with their geography, productions,\r\ncommerce, &c.\r\n\r\nUpon the history of this country, however, the work of Mr. Southey is\r\ncomplete, and does as much honour to the talent of that gentleman as\r\nto his unwearied research. The labour, even with all his facilities,\r\nwhich such an undertaking must have required, cannot but have been very\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nPadre Cazal, who is a man of some talent, enjoyed decided advantages,\r\nit will be allowed, from his ecclesiastical situation, in arriving at\r\nfull and authentic intelligence, as to the present condition of the\r\ntowns, productions, &c. derived from Government documents, his own\r\npersonal research, the diaries of Certanistas, (persons traversing\r\nthe interior,) and from numerous individuals, who might not have\r\nbeen disposed to grant the same privileges to any one differently\r\ncircumstanced. In the many instances wherein I have had opportunities\r\nof putting the veracity of his statements to the test I have found them\r\ncorrect and impartial. No doubt can fairly exist as to the perfect\r\nauthenticity of the whole, additionally confirmed as it is, by Mr.\r\nSouthey’s having had recourse to the same authority in the latter part\r\nof his third volume.\r\n\r\nThe general reader may not be peculiarly interested with that portion\r\nof this publication which details the towns and their productions, and\r\nin which monotony is unavoidable, although they will be valuable as\r\nreferences for the merchant and many others, as, with the evidently\r\ngrowing commerce of this fine country, already taking off annually\r\nthree million of British manufactures, each of those places will\r\nprogressively become more and more important.\r\n\r\nThe plates, which are amongst the best in their style, are executed, by\r\nan able artist, upon stone, from sketches taken on the spot; and the\r\nmap is formed by myself from the materials of the Work. The Appendix\r\nis explanatory of the objects in Zoology and Phytology, which would\r\nnot have been generally understood by their native designations; and I\r\nmust here apologize to the reader for not presenting them in scientific\r\nnomenclature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n                                                                   Page\r\n    _Voyage from England to Rio de Janeiro_                           1\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP.

On our departure from thence we were\r\nfavoured with a fair wind for only a short period; and on the 24th it\r\nopposed us from the westward with such violence, that it rendered our\r\nattempts to beat out of the Channel abortive. We were in consequence\r\nobliged to submit to the only alternative of running for safety to\r\nFalmouth Harbour, and remained there till the 2d of April. Perhaps few\r\nsituations can be conceived more irksome than this. To a mind made up\r\nfor departure, every delay is deemed a misfortune in proportion as the\r\nobject in pursuit is of desirable attainment, and especially in the\r\nconsideration of its prolonging the time that is to re-unite us to\r\nthose we love best. A light breeze from the north-east enabled us to\r\nclear the Channel on the 3d.\r\n\r\nThis part of a voyage from England, though trifling in point of\r\ndistance, is regarded by sailors as pregnant with impending dangers\r\nand difficulties, the Channel being so situated that the prevailing\r\nwesterly winds, at certain seasons of the year, render the egress\r\nextremely intricate. The constant anxiety of the captain and crew till\r\nwe passed the Islands of Scilly, contrasted with the happy security\r\nwhich they then evinced, were proofs of the importance they attached\r\nto it. The feelings of Englishmen on quitting the British shores must\r\nbe various, and, in many instances, exquisitely interesting in pensive\r\nreflections. As for myself, the animated attachment for my native land\r\nand those so dear to me left behind produced a melancholy, heightened\r\nby the surrounding oceanic scene, which, on the other hand, was\r\nalleviated not only by a humble reliance upon that Almighty, in whose\r\npaternal hands is the greater or less share of happiness of all his\r\ncreatures, but also by the hope of a successful issue attending the\r\nvoyage--\r\n\r\n    “Hope that whispers promised pleasure,\r\n    And bids the lovely scenes at distance hail.”\r\n\r\nWe were favoured with a propitious breeze, which continued steady,\r\nat the rate of seven, eight, and nine miles an hour. On the 12th,\r\nwe passed between the Island of Madeira and the African coast: the\r\nvicinity of the former, although we did not see it, was announced by\r\nthe appearance of sea gulls, the only birds I had hitherto noticed,\r\nexcepting one swallow and the mother cary’s chicken, not unlike the\r\nformer at a distance, but rather larger, having white feathers above\r\nthe tail and under the belly, the rest of a brownish cast. It is said\r\nto hatch and carry its young on the water, and is seen, I understand,\r\nin every part of the Atlantic as well as the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\r\nWe met with the swallow in about 40° north latitude and 15° west\r\nlongitude; it made several attempts to alight upon the vessel, but was\r\nprevented by the dog; apparently fatigued, it continued its flight in\r\na northerly direction. This is a phenomenon attending the migration of\r\nthose birds, favouring the opinion that they visit some southern or\r\ntropical climate, during the cold season in England, and is opposed to\r\nthe hypothesis advanced by some of their immersion in ponds, and by\r\nothers of their taking refuge in old walls and ruins. That they assume\r\nsuch a state of torpitude as the first would infer is very improbable.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th of April, we discovered the high peaks\r\nof three of the Canary Islands at a great distance, Grand Canary\r\nbearing south-west, and Lanzarote and Fortaventura south-east. The\r\nworld of waters which had hitherto, from its varied and sometimes\r\nterrific agitation, filled the imagination with awe, was now changed\r\ninto a pacific, but grand expanse, that soothed and absorbed the mind\r\nwith its tranquil magnificence; and the weather, which had been cold\r\nand gloomy, was changed into a balmy mildness and enlivening sunny\r\nclearness. Towards the evening, we came close up to the north-west\r\nside of Fortaventura, a long island, exhibiting a rugged tumulous\r\ncombination of peaks and mountains, rising irregularly one over\r\nanother, of the most barren and cheerless aspect. In vain the sun\r\nextended his genial rays over its sterile wastes, where no salutary\r\nplant appeared to take root, or the least verdure to quicken. With\r\nthe assistance of the glass, I could not discover one single hut or\r\nhuman being along the whole face of it. There is a small port on the\r\nopposite side, where the produce, as well as that of Lanzarote, is\r\nbarilla. The wind having changed, a passage could not be accomplished\r\nround either end of this island. The signal of “about ship” was given,\r\nand we stood for some hours to the northward. Pursuing a southerly\r\ncourse again next day, we came, at noon, close up with land, which,\r\nduring the morning, a thick haze had obscured. The sun now bursting\r\nforth, presented to our view the island of Grand Canary, with its town\r\nof Palmas, furnishing a contrast of a very pleasing nature to the\r\nisland already mentioned. Its romantic and commanding peaks of immense\r\naltitude had their tops concealed in clouds, which the lustre of the\r\nsun seemed unable to dispel. Its amphitheatre of mountains, adorned\r\nwith lively patches of green from their very summits, fertilized by\r\nincreasing cultivation, and in the most luxuriant verdure, down to\r\nthe verge of the sea, concurred, with the town of Palmas, and a large\r\nvillage extending some distance along the parterre, with detached\r\nhouses in the same direction of an elegant appearance, to render the\r\nscene peculiarly animating and lovely. The town of Palmas, which does\r\nnot appear large, and the harbour, which is capacious and safe, are\r\ncommanded by batteries, stationed along a range of mountains to the\r\nnorth of the town. Teneriffe and most of the other islands draw their\r\nsupplies of corn and cattle from Grand Canary. As we proceeded along\r\nits shores, and before the close of the evening, we perceived that\r\nits cultivation was not general. The next day, the Peak of Teneriffe\r\nwas indistinctly seen through the clouds that hung upon the horizon;\r\nthe height, for which it is so celebrated, is apparently diminished\r\nby the elevation of the circumjacent mountains. A north-east trade\r\nwind now wafted us forward with considerable rapidity, rendered more\r\nagreeable by the delicious weather and salubrious atmosphere diffused\r\naround. The familiar and accustomed possession of the prime bounties\r\nof nature must be always gratifying to those whose senses and whose\r\nimagination are even in tolerable vigour; but to an Englishman, blest\r\nwith a sound constitution, and over whom the vicissitudes of life had\r\nnot, as is too often the case, cast a mantle of despondency, to deaden\r\npresent pleasure and darken future prospects, and who had so recently\r\nemerged from a dreary atmosphere, the enjoyment of this, to him,\r\nnew-born paradisaical climate, resembled more a feeling of sudden and\r\nhappy enchantment, than an elemental and natural delight, with which\r\nProvidence had blessed a particular portion of the globe.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d, we made the Cape de Verd Islands, and took our course\r\nbetwixt the islands of St. Anthony, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and St.\r\nNicholas, to the westward, Sal and Bonavista being to the eastward of\r\nus. The isle of Sal is frequented by the Americans for salt, which is\r\ncollected upon it.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d, we ranged along the north-east side of St. Yago, the\r\nlargest of the Cape de Verd Islands, but it was so completely enveloped\r\nin opaque clouds, that we could see no object distinctly upon it. It\r\nis, I believe, more verdant than any of the others, possessing groves\r\nof cocoa-nut trees, and bananas. The volcanic wastes of the island\r\nof Mayo, lying to the eastward of St. Yago, were not obscured by a\r\nsingle cloud, and the industry of man did not appear in any part of\r\nit to have subdued the sterility of nature. It was completely bare of\r\nvegetation, except an impoverished brushwood. I could only discover\r\ntwo or three solitary cocoa-nut trees; notwithstanding, at the end\r\nof this island nearest to us, there was a small town, possessing\r\nsome apparent neatness, but without a single tree or any shelter to\r\nrefrigerate the scorching rays of the sun. I observed a flag projecting\r\nfrom a window, which probably was the house of the governador: there\r\nwas not an inhabitant to be seen, they were, no doubt, indulging\r\nin a _sesta_. The officers of a British ship of war, who had\r\njust come to anchor off the town, were preparing to go on shore, and\r\nmight perhaps rouse some of them from their lethargy. This was a ship\r\nof about 20 guns, and we imagined she belonged to the Sierra Leone\r\nor African station, in which those islands might be included. No\r\nfortifications were visible any where, and it may be inferred, that the\r\nmother country regards so little the importance of those islands, that\r\nno precautions were ever adopted for their defence. The fogs by which\r\nthey are usually obscured are attributed by some to vapours arising\r\nfrom the salt lakes; but as the same general law may be supposed to\r\ngovern such condensations of fog, common to them as well as to the\r\nCanaries and other islands of a high elevation, I should be more\r\ndisposed to think that they originate in the profuse exhalations in\r\nthose latitudes, and in the increased power of attraction attached to\r\nthe volcanic materials of which those accumulated masses of land are\r\ncomposed, thereby more effectually drawing around them this gloomy\r\nmantle. And, although I am not informed as to the circumstance, it is\r\nprobable that the density and quantum of haziness are much greater\r\nwhen the sun is in the northern tropic, and diminishes as he recedes\r\ntowards the southern. From the Cape de Verds, the same favouring\r\ngale continued to swell our sails. In traversing this tropic, the\r\nheavens present the most beautiful and romantic pictures, and the\r\nocean some of its gayest inhabitants for contemplation. It is here the\r\nrapturous scene of the celestial spring. Towards the evening’s sun\r\nespecially, the firmament is seen glowing with purple, orange, and\r\nevery beauteous, delicate, and rich colour, of such transparency and\r\nmatchless brilliancy, that cannot be imagined, as it is never seen\r\nin a northern latitude. The diffusion of such an infinite variety of\r\nwarm tints and other hues, mingled in elegant groups, around the whole\r\nhorizon, enhances the vigorous power of the sapphire back-ground, or\r\nrather the rich blue ethereal canopy to which they form a deep edging,\r\nor grand and resplendent fringe. In vain would the most accomplished\r\nartist attempt its delineation; he could only look up with admiration\r\nand amazement, and, lost in wonder, the hand would be found to refuse\r\nguidance to his pencil.\r\n\r\n    “For who can paint like nature? Can Imagination boast,\r\n    In all her gay creation, hues like hers?”\r\n\r\nWhen the beautiful and sublime scenes I have ineffectually attempted\r\nto give a faint idea of, fade away in the shades of night, and are\r\nsucceeded by the glory of the stellar hemisphere, turn the eye to the\r\ndeep, and a blaze of marine illuminations, frequently seen around\r\nthe ship, in some degree compensates for their loss. This effect is\r\noccasioned by the small blubber fish floating near the surface, and\r\nSolomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like these. The brilliant\r\nappearance, in these waters, of the bonita, albacore, pilot fish, &c.\r\nis only surpassed by the extraordinary change and rapid suffusion of\r\ndelicate colours succeeding each other during the dying moments of\r\nthe dolphin. The flying fish are seen in large numbers, taking their\r\nflight from the water, alarmed by the approach of the vessel, or the\r\npursuit of the dolphin and other fish, to which they are a prey. The\r\nnautilus, commonly called by sailors “the Portuguese man of war,” moves\r\non in slow majesty, with its sail above the water, and secure from\r\nthe attacks of its neighbours by its poisonous qualities: it lowers\r\nand erects its sail at pleasure, which is something like the slice of\r\na large lemon, only that the rind is of a pinkish hue, and the other\r\nparts nicely shaded. Here also is the shark, which may be called the\r\ndestroying demon of the ocean, skulking “about, seeking whom he may\r\ndevour,” with understood horror of purpose both by man and the marine\r\ninhabitants. His approach is soon announced by a general hue and cry\r\nfrom the sailors, who are among his deadliest foes. All are instantly\r\nup in arms. Their animated and entire devotion to their purpose, in\r\nwhich every feeling is interested, can scarcely be equalled by the\r\npleasurable emotions of a sportsman at the moment a fox is breaking\r\ncover. Every artifice is used by throwing out pieces of pork at the end\r\nof ropes, which he voraciously follows to the side of the ship; the\r\nweapons of death are ready; and, after striking him, and a struggle\r\nensuing to get him on board, if, by any effort of his strength, he\r\nbreak away, which I have seen, great is the sullen vexation and\r\ndisappointment shown by the crew. He is usually accompanied by three\r\nor four pilot fish, about the size of a whiting: they are extremely\r\nbeautiful, and appear in the water as if fastened upon his back, near\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of April, in 12° 34′ north latitude, I was, for the first\r\ntime in my life, under a vertical sun, now by degrees moving through\r\nthe northern tropic, and gradually dispensing his benign influence to\r\nthe regions of the north.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May, in 2° north latitude, and 22° west longitude, an\r\nofficer from the _Rockingham_, Captain Waugh, a free trader from\r\nthe East Indies, boarded us, to solicit some trifles they wanted,\r\nand particularly newspapers, which their passengers, including some\r\nladies, he stated, were extremely desirous to see. There was a peculiar\r\npleasure in having even a transient intercourse with a ship at sea,\r\nand being enabled to relieve, in any degree, their wants. The social\r\nfeelings, the fellow sympathies of man, were revived with renewed\r\nvigour by the idea of our having, on the wide and solitary ocean, been\r\nmutually so long separated from our own proper element and exposed to\r\nthe perils of the deep, and by the new sight of our countrymen, after\r\nhaving been confined to the view only of those within the compass\r\nof the few yards that enclosed the space of the brig. It increased\r\nthe kindly emotions in the awakened thoughts of absent country, and\r\nespecially of the dear family circle of home.\r\n\r\n    “Home! There is a magic in that little word!\r\n    It is a mystic circle that surrounds\r\n    Pleasures and comforts never known beyond\r\n    The hallow’d limit.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time we lost the north-east trade wind, which was succeeded\r\nby calms and squalls, that detained us seven or eight days near the\r\nLine. Nothing can be experienced in a voyage much more unpleasant\r\nthan this vicissitude of weather. The irksomeness of a calm near the\r\nequator is rendered almost insupportable by the ardent rays of the\r\nsun; every one seems to languish: several, and often many hours drag\r\nheavily on, while the vessel makes no progress, and only experiences\r\na disagreeable motion by the heaving of the glassy ocean, its surface\r\nnot being in the least ruffled by a breath of air. In the mean time, an\r\nelemental war is brooding. A black and pitchy cloud is seen awfully and\r\nslowly moving on, with fury in its train; all is alarm; with haste the\r\nsails are lowered. The sullen langour of the atmosphere is succeeded\r\nby the “maddening tempest,” so suddenly and with so little warning,\r\nthat sometimes, before every precaution can be taken, the sweeping\r\nimpetuosity lays the vessel instantaneously upon her side, and, in\r\nthat situation, she is hurried forward with immense velocity. These\r\nconflicting winds are as quickly followed by solid torrents of rain.\r\nIn a short period, all is tranquillity again, and the returning sun,\r\nin burning radiance, annihilates the last breeze that feebly curled\r\nthe face of the ocean. The same scenes alternately present themselves.\r\nDuring the night these sudden squalls are the most dangerous, as their\r\napproach cannot be so well ascertained.\r\n\r\nOn the first day that we were becalmed, notwithstanding the advances we\r\noccasionally made by the transient operation of those gusts, we found\r\nour latitude 1° 43′ north, and the preceding day it was only 1° 23′.\r\nThis can only be accounted for by the strong northerly currents now\r\nprevailing here; and hence it would appear, that the same invariable\r\nlaw of attraction governs them as well as the winds. The squalls I\r\nhave mentioned also came from the south and south-east, and the winds\r\nbeginning at this time to blow here, issue from the same quarter, in\r\nconsequence, no doubt, of the sun being in the northern tropic. If he\r\ncreates a vacuum in his vicinity by the rarefaction of the air, which\r\ninduces a great influx from the southern and northern hemispheres\r\nof the atmosphere, in like manner the exuberant evaporations from\r\nthe sea may produce a rushing of the waters to supply what is lost\r\n(_pro tempore_) by vapours. Various causes, however, operate to\r\nprevent an uniform appearance in this respect, such as the occasional\r\ncounter-attraction of the moon and other celestial bodies, of\r\ncontinents and other lands, as well as a prevailing repulsive power in\r\nnature. Still if those effects could be minutely followed through their\r\nvarious ramifications, it might be found that the winds and currents\r\noriginate in the combinations I have ventured to suggest. Is it not\r\npossible, that the calms near the equator at this period may arise\r\nfrom the equally poised contention of the south-east and north-east\r\nwinds meeting, and that the former, in the sun’s march through the\r\nnorthern tropic, will gradually gain upon the latter in extent of\r\ndominion proportioned to the sun’s declination, and _vice versa_\r\nas he recedes through the southern tropic, or, more properly speaking,\r\nin the earth’s oblique revolution round the sun? The rust, which at\r\nthis time constantly showed itself upon my razors, was probably owing\r\nto some peculiar corrosive properties in the atmosphere, or it might\r\nhave arisen from some saline moisture insinuating itself every where\r\nimperceptibly.\r\n\r\nBut to attempt to comprehend or explain the extraordinary operations\r\nin the grand work of nature, in this and other latitudes, has in many\r\ninstances baffled the keenest sagacity and most laborious research.\r\nSecondary causes of the phenomena in nature are often beyond the\r\nclearest ken of human intellect, how then are the faculties of the mind\r\nbewildered in the contemplation of the great First Cause! How lost and\r\nabsorbed in adoration of the Divine source, the essence of all those\r\nwonderfully diversified appearances! The hand moves the pen with which\r\nI now write; I can trace the power that impels it--the cause of this\r\neffect, to the immediate impulse only, that is, to the muscles in the\r\narm, that, arising thence, connect themselves with the hand. But can\r\nI go back any further? Can I ascertain what it is that produces this\r\nadmirable power in the muscles, this secondary cause? Reason here\r\ndiscovers its confined limit as to remoter and efficient causes, but,\r\nbounding at once over these concealed regions of knowledge, sees and\r\nacknowledges the great original source of all finite existence, and in\r\nthe power of thinking, and in the movement of his bodily frame, man\r\nfeels that\r\n\r\n    “It is the Divinity that stirs within him.”\r\n\r\nHe has an undeniable and practical evidence of the existence, power,\r\nand goodness of an invisible and eternal Being, from whom all creation\r\nhas emanated.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of May, we crossed the Line in 23° west longitude. The calms\r\nand squalls were succeeded by cloudy weather and light breezes from the\r\nsouth and south-east, which in a few days assumed the steadiness of\r\nthe trade wind, but not accompanied with that beautiful serenity and\r\nbrightness of sky, which we experienced whilst in the north-east trade\r\nwind. Neptune and his wife Amphitrite did not make their appearance;\r\nor, to speak without mythological allusion, the usual ceremonies on\r\ncrossing the Line were not observed, owing, I presume, to the fatigue\r\nand exhaustion sustained by the sailors, in consequence of the variable\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Ja^s. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  VIEW OF THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE BAY OF RIO DE JANEIRO, FROM THE\r\n  SUGAR LOAF MOUNTAIN TO THE CITY.]\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of May, we discovered, at a distance, Cape Frio, a\r\ndiscovery which always fills with joy the breasts of those making\r\na voyage to this part of the world. And no wonder. For having\r\nlaunched out upon the wide immeasurable ocean, where uncertainty\r\nand dangers always accompany him, man, at this refreshing sight,\r\nfeels reassured of his safety, and obtains a promise of the eventual\r\nsuccess of his voyage. Besides, he experiences a rich glow of mind\r\nat viewing the natural element of his support and existence, and a\r\nfeeling of deep interest on beholding, if for the first time, a new\r\nportion of the world. From this promontory, the coast swells in a\r\nnorth-east direction to Cape St. Roque, forming the most easterly\r\nportion of territory in South America. Rio de Janeiro lies exactly\r\nwest from, and in the same latitude with, Cape Frio, at a distance\r\nof about eighty miles. The coast betwixt them presents a continued\r\nappearance of rugged mountains, and through every aperture they are\r\nseen undulating in accumulated alpines far back into the interior of\r\nthis vast continent. Tremendous precipices, at every opening of the\r\nnearer mountains, strike the imagination with wonder, snowy clouds\r\noccasionally obscuring the contracted valleys at their feet, and\r\nresting in detached and airy vapours upon their sides, whilst their\r\nsummits and other parts are brightened by the purest atmosphere and\r\nsunshine. This scene conveys to the European traveller a grand idea and\r\nforetaste of the peculiar magnificence of size and aspect, with which\r\nnature has displayed herself in the new continent. After proceeding\r\nabout forty miles along this shore, a view is commanded from Cape\r\nFrio to Gavea, or the Parrot’s Beak, a distance of near one hundred\r\nmiles. The entrance, through a narrow inlet amongst the mountains, to\r\nthe bay of Rio de Janeiro, is pointed out by one of a singular shape,\r\nresembling a sugar-loaf, the strata of which it is composed appearing\r\nto run perpendicularly. Here is presented one of the most picturesque\r\nand beautiful scenes that can well be imagined. Abrupt and towering\r\nprecipices of wild and fanciful shapes, universally robed in verdant\r\nshrubs of various kinds, surround this fine bay, containing nearly one\r\nhundred islands, to the circumference of which the eye cannot extend.\r\nThe bases of these mountains, consisting of granite, are beautified\r\nwith numerous sweeping crescents of more perfect cultivation, edged\r\nwith white cottages and houses, from whence narrow valleys, adorned\r\nwith orange trees, are seen winding amongst the mountains. The clear,\r\nsunny, and smiling face of nature; the verdant islands, which look in\r\ntheir loveliness as if they were intended for the abode of beings more\r\nrefined in intellect and more pure in heart than weak and erring man;\r\nthe shipping dispersed about the bay, the city seen at a distance,\r\ncombined with an airy and elegant aqueduct, which conveys from the\r\nmountains water for the supply of the town, all impressing the idea of\r\nsocial happiness, of the comforts and elegancies produced by science\r\nand civilized society, are, after a long and consequently tedious\r\nvoyage, welcome sights to the aquatic traveller, re-enlivening his\r\nspirits, and, in the anticipation of the enjoyments of his proper\r\nelement, land, are the beginnings of the compensation it affords him\r\nfor the privations he has been enduring at sea. A little higher up, on\r\nthe opposite side to the sugar-loaf, is the fort of Santa Cruz, where\r\nships for a few minutes bring to, and answer various questions. From\r\nhence a signal is made, which is repeated from a hill close by the\r\ntown, announcing to what country the ship arrived belongs. The vessel\r\nthen cast anchor off the island of Fort Villegagnon, to which place\r\nshe despatched a boat to bring on board a serjeant and two soldiers,\r\nwho remained as a guard, till nearly a day was consumed before the\r\ncaptain of the port, a military officer, a doctor, &c. had, one after\r\nthe other, come off in boats, at their pleasure, to visit the ship,\r\ncreating an unnecessary and tedious delay. At last, the vessel moved\r\non to the vicinity of the Isle das Cobras, from whence, after a\r\ncustom-house guard had arrived, the soldiers conducted the Captain and\r\nmyself to the palace and other offices, where the ship’s name, &c. were\r\ngiven in. On here taking leave of the brig, I must do justice to my\r\nfeelings by observing, that I received the most friendly attention from\r\nthe Captain, whose gentlemanly and well-regulated conduct were highly\r\nhonourable to him.\r\n\r\nOn landing, the prepossession regarding this place gives way to an\r\nimpression by no means favourable, produced by narrow streets, crowded\r\nwith negroes, whose black faces and savage songs, which they howl out\r\nas an encouragement to each other under the burdens and loads which\r\nthey drag along, fill the mind of the stranger, unaccustomed to such\r\nscenes, with dejection. The fairy visions in the bay, too recent yet\r\nto have disappeared from the imagination, vanished at such discordant\r\nsounds and uncouth appearances; and suffering, rather than satisfaction\r\nand enjoyment, appeared to be resident here. The discordant sounds\r\nafforded, perhaps, some consolatory relief to the poor negroes, by\r\ndividing their attention in some degree from their toil. They were an\r\neffort of nature, ever fertile in resources under calamity, to drive\r\naway care; but they were on that account a proof of their misery.\r\nThey thus imparted a trifling gratification to the sable sufferers,\r\nbut they penetrated mournfully to my heart, unused as I was to such\r\nmisery-elicited minstrelsy, for it was slavery under a temporary\r\nattempt at disguise. “Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still, slavery!”\r\nsaid I, with Sterne, “still thou art a bitter draught! and though\r\nthousands, in all ages, have been made to drink of thee, thou art no\r\nless bitter on that account.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Ja^s. Henderson._\r\n    _Redman Lithog._\r\n\r\n  CUSTOM HOUSE NEGROES. RIO DE JANEIRO.]\r\n\r\nThe human frame will seldom bear, without injury, its transmission\r\nto a climate very dissimilar to that to which its birth and previous\r\nresidence have accustomed it. Thus the English residing here exhibit in\r\ntheir appearance the effects of this tropical climate, and, although\r\nthey are otherwise in health, there is a debility manifest in their\r\ncountenances, something resembling the appearance of a person in a\r\nstate of convalescence after illness.\r\n\r\nI waited upon Henry Chamberlaine, Esq. the British charge d’affaire,\r\nwith a letter of introduction from a nobleman, and discovered, at that\r\ninterview, that my expectations of entering actively upon the functions\r\nof a public situation were not likely to be realized; I therefore\r\nadopted the determination, to which my mind was pre-disposed, of\r\ndevoting my time to the acquirement of such intelligence, regarding the\r\nvast regions of the Brazil, as circumstances would admit of. Houses of\r\npublic accommodation may be said scarcely to exist in this city, and\r\nare of such inferior order, that strangers are peculiarly fortunate\r\nif they are received into the residence of a friend. The liberality\r\nand frank hospitality of a merchant, to whom I brought a letter of\r\nintroduction, relieved me from any inconvenience on this score.\r\nPreviously to my entering upon a general description of this city, and\r\nthe several provinces composing the Portuguese possessions in South\r\nAmerica, of which it is now the metropolis, it may not be irrelevant\r\nto give some account of the first discovery of this widely-extended\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. II.\r\n\r\n   _From the First Discovery down to the Arrival of the Royal\r\n   Family there, and its present Division into Provinces--The\r\n   general Character of the Indians._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe honour of discovering the new world, it is well known, justly\r\nbelongs to Christopher Columbus, a pilot of Genoa, although it\r\nderives its name from Americanus Vespuccius, a Florentine navigator,\r\nwho performed two voyages to this hemisphere, under the auspices of\r\nhis Castilian Majesty, and two others by order of Emanuel, King of\r\nPortugal. The latter voyages the Portuguese writers flatly deny,\r\nand attribute the promulgation of a story so devoid of truth to the\r\narrogance and pride of Vespuccius; nor, in fact, does his relation\r\nrespecting this point appear to be supported by any collateral\r\ntestimony. A mere accidental occurrence, indeed, induced Columbus\r\nfirst to entertain the idea of launching out upon unknown seas. The\r\nmaster of a caravelleon, named Francisco Sanches, about the year\r\n1480, arrived at Madeira, where Columbus then was, in a most pitiable\r\ncondition, with three or four sailors only remaining, and nearly\r\nexhausted, in consequence of a tremendous tempest which had assailed\r\ntheir ungovernable bark, and driven them to a remote western longitude,\r\nwhere they saw, or fancied they saw, land. It was in those days\r\nimagined, that the eastern coast of Asia was the western boundary of\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean, and Columbus was persuaded, that the land which\r\nSanches had seen was the island of Japan, or some other island upon\r\nthat coast, and which was then only arrived at by navigating around the\r\ncoast of Africa. The novel circumstance stirred up in his mind the most\r\nanimating presentiments;--the glory of opening to India a shorter and\r\nmore easy passage, by proceeding directly across the Atlantic, inspired\r\nColumbus with enthusiasm, and he flattered himself, that the disclosure\r\nof his ideas would produce ready concurrence in furnishing the\r\nadequate equipments for the enterprise. He proceeded to Genoa for the\r\npurpose of proposing his plan, but it was regarded there as a chimera.\r\nHe submitted the same proposition to John II. of Portugal, whose\r\nsubject he then was, which was rejected by the votes of some chosen\r\ngeographers. He next directed his way to the court of Castile, where\r\nthe learned ones entertained the same sentiments upon the subject\r\nas the cosmographers of Lusitania, and where, perhaps, he would have\r\nbeen equally unsuccessful had not the spontaneous offers which Luiz de\r\nSantangal made to provide all the money requisite for the expedition,\r\nand the voluntary proposal of Don Pedro de Mendonca to contribute\r\none-eighth of the expenses, overcome every difficulty. He sailed from\r\nPalos, with three caravelleons under his command, on the 3d of August,\r\n1492, and, passing the Canaries, directed his course to the westward,\r\ntill the 11th of October, when he descried an island, which he called\r\nSt. Salvador, now one of the Bahama Islands. He was much disheartened\r\nat having traversed so much of the ocean with so little success; but he\r\ncontinued, however, the voyage, and discovered the Island of Cuba, of\r\nHispaniola, now St. Domingo, and left 38 men there in a wooden fort. He\r\nthen retraced his way back, and arrived at Lisbon on the 6th of March,\r\n1493. Columbus made three other voyages across the Atlantic, under the\r\nprotection of Ferdinand V. His second voyage was commenced from Cadiz,\r\non the 25th of September, 1493. He re-visited the Island of Hispaniola,\r\ndiscovered Jamaica, and a great many other islands to the southward\r\nof Cuba, and which, for its fertility and picturesque beauty, he\r\ndenominated the garden of the kingdom. Upon his third voyage, in 1498,\r\nhe saw the island of Trinidad, at the mouth of the Oronocos, on the 1st\r\nof August. He afterwards disembarked on various parts of the coast of\r\nParia, returned to Hispaniola, and then to Europe. He sailed again from\r\nCadiz on the 9th of May, 1502, a third time visited Hispaniola, and\r\ncontinued to navigate onward till he discovered the Island of Guanaia,\r\nnear Cape Honduras, and subsequently explored all the coast of the\r\ncontinent, from Cape Gracias to Porto Bello.\r\n\r\nSome persons, however, affirm that it is a great injustice to\r\nattribute the honour of discovering this hemisphere to either of those\r\nnavigators, when it is certain that the oriental Syberios, called\r\nChoukes, were in the habit of passing the Straits of Bhering, to the\r\nAmerican continent, in the summer season, from time immemorial. The\r\nDanes discovered Greenland about the end of the tenth century, and the\r\nNorwegians colonized it in the following one; and if this land is not a\r\nportion of the continent, it is at least an island belonging to it.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly described the first discovery of the American continent,\r\nit will now be in unison with the object of this work, to invite the\r\nattention to an investigation of the circumstances resulting from the\r\ndiscovery of that portion of it more immediately under consideration,\r\nand which has excited endeavours on my part, very inadequate to render\r\njustice to a subject of such prodigious magnitude. The Portuguese\r\nimagine (and the inscriptions met with in the Brazil would appear\r\nto corroborate the notion) that their countryman and ancestor, Pedro\r\nAlvarez Cabral, was the first discoverer of that country; but this\r\nhonour indubitably belongs to the celebrated Spanish pilot, Vincente\r\nYanez Pinson, the companion of Columbus in his first voyage across\r\nthe Atlantic; and who, it is affirmed, would not have acquired the\r\nfame of first descrying the new world, had not the despondency which\r\nwas clouding his mind, in the progress of that voyage, been dispelled\r\nby the animating hope of success with which Pinson encouraged him.\r\nIn virtue of a commission granted to Vincente Yanez Pinson, by\r\nthe Castilian court, he quitted his native shores in pursuit of\r\nundiscovered countries, in the month of December, 1499. He shaped his\r\ncourse more to the southward than his late commander, Columbus; and on\r\nthe 26th of January, 1500, discovered land in about 8° south latitude,\r\nhaving crossed the Atlantic in as short a period as the voyage is\r\ncommonly accomplished in at this day; evincing an undaunted spirit and\r\ndisregard to the prevailing practice then existing amongst navigators,\r\nof taking in all sail and lying to during the night. The discovery\r\nof this new land must have been highly consolatory and gratifying to\r\nhis feelings; he gave it, therefore, the name of Cape Consolation,\r\nwhich can be no other than Cape St. Augustine, situated about twenty\r\nmiles to the south of Pernambuco. Pinson vainly went through the\r\nceremony of taking possession of the country for the Spanish crown.\r\nThe natives which they saw were exceedingly shy, and they endeavoured\r\nwithout success to accomplish any intercourse with them. He proceeded\r\nnorthward, towards Cape St. Roque, with his ships, and, again landing\r\nupon the intervening coast, his people had several rencounters with\r\na horde of savages very different to the first they had seen. These\r\nIndians used the bow and arrow, and attacked the Spaniards with great\r\nspirit and dexterity. This reception induced Pinson to continue his\r\ncourse along the northern coast of the Brazil; and, after proceeding\r\nas far as the Oronocos, he returned to Europe without any manifest\r\nadvantage resulting from this undertaking. Although he was unfortunate\r\nin losing some of his ships on the homeward voyage, he displayed\r\nconsiderable nautical skill in conducting his vessels in safety along\r\nthe most difficult and dangerous part of the Brazilian coast.\r\n\r\nDuring the period that Pinson was thus occupied, Portugal was fitting\r\nout a fleet with much pomp and parade in the river Tagus, not with any\r\nproject of discovering a new territory, but in consequence of Don Vasco\r\nda Gama having arrived at Lisbon, with certain intelligence of having\r\nascertained the navigation to India, round the Cape of Good Hope. The\r\nPortuguese King, Emanuel, determined to send a fleet to establish\r\nfriendship and a treaty of commerce with the King of Calcutta, and\r\nto create a factory in the same city. Merchandise of the best taste\r\nwas selected for the outward cargo, and the ships were to be laden in\r\nreturn with spices. For the command of this fleet, which consisted of\r\nten caravels, and three larger vessels, a fidalgo was chosen, called\r\nPedro Alvarez Cabral. The number of persons on board amounted to\r\ntwelve hundred well selected and well armed. The fleet was prepared in\r\nfront of the Rastello, now called Belem; and it was determined that it\r\nshould sail on the 9th of March, 1500. At the vespers preceding, which\r\nwas on Sunday, the King went with all the court to open mass, in the\r\nhermitage of our Lady of Belem, (or Bethlehem,) which site is occupied\r\nat this day by the magnificent monastery of P. P. Jeronymos. Diogo\r\nOrtiz, Bishop of Ceuta, delivered a discourse upon the object of the\r\nexpedition; and, during the service, a flag was placed upon the altar,\r\nwith the cross of the order of Christ, which the Bishop, with imposing\r\nceremony, consecrated; and the King, with his own hands, delivered\r\nit to Cabral, who was near his Majesty during the ceremonies. The\r\n_funçaō_ being finished, the colours were carried in procession,\r\naccompanied by the King, to the beach, where Cabral and most of the\r\ncaptains kissed his hand, and at the same time a grand salute was fired\r\nby the whole fleet. This was considered the most powerful and brilliant\r\narmament that had ever sailed from Portugal for distant countries.\r\nThe other captains were Sancho de Thoar (with succession to Admiral\r\nCabral), N. Coelho (who had been with Vasco da Gama), S. de Miranda\r\nd’Azevedo, A. G. da Sylva, V. d’Athayde, S. de Pina, N. Leytao, P.\r\nd’Athayde, L. Pirez, Gaspar de Lemos, the celebrated Bartholomew Dias,\r\ndiscoverer of the Cape of Good Hope, and Diogo Dias, his brother, who\r\nwere to remain with the factory to be established. There were, besides,\r\nseven Franciscan friars, subordinate to one named Frey Henrique, who\r\nwas afterwards bishop of Ceuta, eight chaplains, and a vicar, to\r\nadminister the sacraments in the factory of Calcutta. Ayres Correa was\r\nappointed factor, or head of the establishment; and G. Barboza, and\r\nPedro Vas de Caminho, _escrivaōs_, or writers.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of March, the fleet passed the Canaries; and after having\r\nseen the island of St. Nicholas, one of the Cape de Verds, on the\r\n22d, they discovered that the vessel of V. d’Athayde was missing.\r\nCabral took every pains to fall in with it again, but without effect.\r\nHe continued his voyage, and in order to avoid being detained by\r\nthe calms peculiar to the coast of Africa, and to profit by the\r\nprevailing north-east trade wind, they stood so much to the westward,\r\nthat, on the 21st of April, (the last Oitava of Pascal,) they met\r\nwith signals of land, (which were certain floating plants,) and late\r\non the following day, in latitude 17° south, they saw a large round\r\nmountain with smaller hills, which were the highest portions of the\r\nSerra, now called Aymores, mostly covered with wood. Cabral made a\r\nsignal to the other ships to approach the land, and by sun-set they\r\nanchored in 19 fathoms, about six leagues from it. From respect to\r\nthe _oitavario_,[1] Cabral gave the mountain the name of Mount\r\nPascal, which it yet retains; and the land he called Vera Cruz. The\r\nfollowing day they sailed towards the land, and came in front of the\r\nmouth of a river now called Rio de Frade (River Friar); and remained\r\nhalf a league distant from it during the night, with some difficulty,\r\nin consequence of a strong south-east wind setting in. Captain N.\r\nCoelho examined the river the same day, which was found incapable of\r\nreceiving even the smallest vessels of the fleet; and the wind not\r\nbeing favourable to coast towards the south, Cabral ordered the fleet\r\nto navigate northward, and despatched Affonso Lopez, his pilot, in one\r\nof the smallest caravels, to proceed nearer the beach, and to examine\r\nthe first part he met with.\r\n\r\nThe squadron having coasted on about ten leagues, met with the bay\r\nof Corôa Vermelha, otherwise Cabral, where, towards the evening, the\r\ncaravels nearest entered. Affonso Lopez, who was sounding the port,\r\nmet with two young Indians in a canoe, whom he carried to the admiral,\r\nwho had anchored with the larger ships a league from the reefs, which\r\nwere at the entrance of the bay. They were next morning placed upon\r\nthe beach dressed in Portuguese clothes, accompanied by a degradado,\r\nor criminal, in order to observe the mode of living which prevailed\r\namongst the natives.\r\n\r\nThe fleet remained here eight days, during which time mass was\r\ncelebrated twice by Frey Henrique; the first, on Easter Sunday, upon\r\nan island (its name is now Corôa Vermelha) within the bay, in sight of\r\na great number of Indians assembled upon the continental beach; the\r\nother, on the 1st of May, at the foot of a grand cross, which had been\r\nerected upon the main land, with the arms of King Emanuel, in testimony\r\nof the solemn possession which in his name had been taken of this new\r\nland of Vera Cruz.\r\n\r\nThere is a letter in the naval archives at Rio de Janeiro, written by\r\nP. V. de Caminho (one of the _escrivaōs_ already mentioned) to\r\nKing Emanuel, giving a minute detail of all the circumstances attending\r\nthe stay of the armament in this port, which Cabral called “Porto\r\nSeguro,” in noticing which, the above letter, written in language\r\ndiffering from that of the present day, says, “_Acharam hos ditos\r\nnavios pequenos huum a recife com huum porto dentro muyti boo, e muyti\r\nseguro com huuma muy larga entrada, e meterem-se dentro._” Also,\r\n“_entraram toda las naaos e amcoraram-se em simco, seis bracas, ha\r\nqual amcorajem demtro he tam grande e tam fremosa, e tam segura, que\r\npodem jaser demtro neela mais de duzentos navios e naaos._”[2]\r\nHe says the Indians were quite naked, and their bodies painted with\r\nvarious colours. They wore pendants of white bone from their ears.\r\nTheir cheeks were in like manner ornamented with bones, and their lips\r\nslit, into which similar ornaments were also introduced. They used bows\r\nand arrows. The two natives who came on board, when they saw the gold\r\nembroidery upon the collar of Cabral’s coat, danced, put their hands\r\nto the ground, and then to the collar: they showed the same feeling\r\nin regard to silver; from which it was inferred that those precious\r\nmetals were not unknown to them. This letter also says, “_Mostraram\r\nlhes huum papagayo pardo que aquy ho capitam tras; tomaram no logo na\r\nmaao; mostraram lhes huum carneyro, non fezeram delle mençam; mostraram\r\nlhes huuma galinha, e asy aviam medo dela, e nom lhe queriam poeer ha\r\nmaao._”[3] The Portuguese offered them bread, dressed fish, and\r\nother things, which on tasting they put out of their mouths; also wine,\r\nwhich they did not like, and would not take it a second time. They\r\nestablished a friendly intercourse with those Indians, from whom they\r\nreceived in exchange for trifling articles, fruits, farinha (or flour)\r\nof the mandioca, maize, &c. This writer, with many of the captains,\r\nwent a league and a half up the country, where they met with a body\r\nof Indians, who had nine or ten houses rudely built of wood covered\r\nwith grass; each house had two small entrances, and was large enough\r\nto receive thirty or forty persons. It consisted of but one apartment,\r\nwithout any division. They bartered with them things of no value for\r\nlarge and beautiful red parrots, two small green ones, and other\r\nthings. They went on shore again the next day to get wood and wash\r\nlinen, when they found sixty or seventy Indians, without bows or any\r\nthing else, upon the beach, which number soon increased to two hundred,\r\nall without bows and arrows. They mixed amongst the Portuguese, and\r\nassisted them to collect wood and put it on board the boats. That\r\nCabral considered this land an island is evidenced by the conclusion of\r\nthe letter. “_Beijo haas maaos de V. A. deste Porto Seguro da vosa\r\nIlha da Vera Cruz. Hoje, Sesta feira primeiro dia de Mayo, 1500. P. V.\r\nde Caminha._”[4]\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of May, this fleet sailed from Porto Seguro, and proceeded\r\non its voyage to India, leaving two degradados behind, who were seen\r\nlamenting and crying upon the beach, and the men of the country\r\ncomforting them, demonstrating that they were not a people devoid\r\nof pity.[5] One of them soon learnt the idiom of the Indians called\r\nTupininquins. He served as interpreter to the first Portuguese who\r\narrived there, and afterwards returned home. Some of the Portuguese\r\nwriters are piqued at the Spanish authors, Berredo and Antonio Galvum,\r\nfor pretending, as they say, that their countryman, Vincente Yanez\r\nPinson first discovered the Brazil; and they bring, as testimony\r\nagainst the Spaniards, the following statement of Robertson. “Vicente\r\nYanez Pinson, one of the admiral’s companions in his first voyage,\r\nsailed from Palos with four ships; he stood boldly towards the south,\r\nand was the first Spaniard who ventured to cross the equinoctial line;\r\nbut he seems to have landed on no part of the coast beyond the mouth\r\nof the Marignon, or River of the Amazons.” Robertson does not make a\r\npositive assertion that Pinson did not land upon any other part of\r\nthe Brazilian coast, nor does he enter into particulars or give any\r\ndates. The river Amazons is the north-western boundary of the Brazil;\r\nand even if he only landed at the mouth of this great river, he of\r\ncourse landed upon the Brazilian territory, and was unquestionably\r\nthe first discoverer of it. Conceding to the Portuguese the passage\r\nwhich they adduce from Robertson, it offers no contradiction to the\r\ncircumstances and dates already detailed of Pinson’s voyage, which\r\nshow him to have anticipated the Portuguese at least three months in\r\nthis discovery. Cabral despatched Gaspar de Lemos from Porto Seguro,\r\nto announce to the King this new land, which had been taken possession\r\nof in his Majesty’s name. It is said that Lemos coasted northward\r\nas far as Cape St. Roque, to ascertain the extent of this territory\r\nwhich they had considered an island. Emanuel was so delighted with the\r\ndiscovery of Vera Cruz, that he resolved to send out another squadron\r\nto explore more minutely its extent; and it appears that three caravels\r\nwere ordered to sail upon this project from the Tagus, on the 1st of\r\nMay, 1501, but there is a considerable doubt who was the commander\r\nof them; some say it was Americanus Vespuccius, others, that it was\r\nGonsalo Coelho. Cabral met this squadron at Goree on his return from\r\nIndia, but the commander’s name is not mentioned. “_Che gamos ao\r\nCabo da Boa Esperance dia de Pascoa e encontrando alli bom tempo,\r\ncontinuamos a viagem, e aportamos junto a Cabo Verde em Bezenegue,\r\nonde encontramos tres caravellas, que El Rey de Portugal mandara para\r\ndescubrir a terra nova que tinhamos achado hindo para Calecute._”[6]\r\nFrancisco de Cunha, author of the Geographical Description of\r\nPortuguese America, states that (“_Gonsala Coelho fora o primeiro\r\nexplorador da Costa Bazillica depois de Cabral e Lemos_,”) Gonsalo\r\nCoelho was the first explorer of the Brazilian coast after Cabral and\r\nLemos. Americanus Vespuccius, in his own manuscript, asserts that he\r\nundertook two voyages for the King of Portugal, this being the first.\r\nIt is difficult to arrive at a fair conclusion from this conflicting\r\ntestimony, whether he or G. Coelho had the command of those three\r\ncaravels. The Portuguese deny positively that it was Vespuccius; and\r\na French writer of “the General History of Voyages” peremptorily\r\nfalsifies all that Vespuccius has advanced upon the subject. “_Les\r\nrelations d’Americ Vespuce contienent le recit de deux voiages, qu’il\r\nfit sur la même côte (du Brezil), au nom d’Emanuel, Rio de Portugal;\r\nmais les dates en sont fausses, et c’est en quoi consiste l’imposture;\r\ncar il est prouvé par tous les temoignages contemporains que dans le\r\ntems qu’il nomme, il étoit emploie à d’autres expeditions._”[7]\r\nAntonio Galvum mentions the expedition but not the commander. All the\r\nevidence however, regarding this squadron, concur as to the time of\r\nits sailing, and arrival at the Brazil on the 17th of August. After a\r\nlong and tempestuous voyage, they made land near Rio Grande, to the\r\nsouth of Cape St. Roque, where they met with Indians of a savage nature\r\nand decidedly cannibals. Several people from the Portuguese ships\r\nwere seized by them, roasted over a large fire in presence of their\r\ncountrymen, with loud shoutings and rejoicings. The cannibals were so\r\nexpert with their bows and arrows, that this fleet was considerably\r\nannoyed by them, and induced to coast on to the latitude of 8°\r\nsouth, near Pernambuco, where they met with friendly Indians,[8] and\r\nestablished an intercourse with them. After a few days, they continued\r\ntheir voyage along the coast, and met with a kind reception every where\r\nfrom the natives, who allowed them to land and make their observations\r\nwithout injury upon the country and its productions. They described\r\nthe natives as being exceedingly well made, and universally attached\r\nto the custom of perforating their faces and ears, and wearing bones\r\nand stones as ornaments. They coasted on to 32° south latitude, and,\r\nstanding out to sea, reached as high a latitude as 52° south, where,\r\nin consequence of a tempestuous _lebeccio_, they were compelled\r\nto return, and arrived at Lisbon in September, 1502, having lost two\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nAnother expedition of six caravels sailed from Lisbon on the 10th of\r\nJune, 1503, with the avowed object of prosecuting still further the\r\nexamination of Vera Cruz. A variety of contradictory statements render\r\nit doubtful who was the real commander of this squadron, although\r\nthe balance of testimony in this, as in the former case, is much in\r\nfavour of Gonsalo Coelho. Americanus Vespuccius again alleges that he\r\naccompanied this fleet, and with two ships proceeded forward to the\r\ncoast of the Brazil, leaving the other four vessels at an island, some\r\nof them wrecks; and he says those four vessels were all lost through\r\nthe want of ability on the part of the commander, whose name he does\r\nnot disclose. A work published at Paris, attributing the command of\r\nthe three first caravels to Vespuccius, continues thus:--“_El Rey D.\r\nManuel extremamente affeicoado a Vespucio deu lhe o commando de seis\r\nnavios com os quaes sahiu a dez de Mayo, 1503, e passou ao longo das\r\ncostas d’Africa, e do Brazil, com o intuito de descubrir uma passagem\r\npelo occidente para as Ilhas Mallucas, como ao depois se-descubriu:\r\ndepois d’apportar na Bahia de todos os Santos, navegou athe os Abrolhos\r\ne rio Curababo, como nāo tinha mantimentos senāo para Vinte mezes,\r\ntomou a resoluçao de voltar a Portugal onde chegou a dezoito de Junho,\r\n1504._”[9] Maneol Ayres de Cazal supposes Christovam Jacques to\r\nhave been the commander, and Francisco de Cunha says, that the King\r\n“_Mandou logo preparar outra armada de caravellas que entregou a\r\nChristovam Jacques, fidalgo de sua casa e com o titulo de Cap-Mor,\r\no mandou continuar n’este empressa descubrindo aquella costa, sahui\r\narmada, e seguindo viagem chegou a costa, sondando baixos e rios pondo\r\npadroes d’armas Portuguezes, foi dar a huma bahia, aque poz o nome de\r\nTodos Santos, e depois deligencias se recolhou a Portugal._”[10] But\r\nDamian de Goes assigns the command to Goncallo Coelho. “_No mesmo\r\nanno de 1503 mandou Goncallo Coelho com seis naus a terra de St. Cruz\r\ncom que partiu de Lisboa a hos dez dias de mez de Junho; das quaes por\r\nainda terem pouca noticia da terra perdeu quatro, e has outras duas\r\ntrouxe aho regno com mercadorias da terra que entam nam eram outras que\r\npau vermelho que chamam Brazil, e papagaios._”[11]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of three writers attribute the command of these six\r\ncaravels to three distinct individuals; but, from a fair investigation\r\nof each statement, that of Goes, who assigns the command to Coelho,\r\nappears more consonant with truth and the intentions of the King,\r\nthan the other two relations. The collateral supporter of Vespuccius’\r\nclaim, represents the object of the expedition to be for the discovery\r\nof the Moluccas, which certainly does not coincide with the desire of\r\nan immediate and continued exploration of St. Cruz, (or Vera Cruz,)\r\nthat seemed to actuate his Majesty solely in fitting it out; nor does\r\nthis account say any thing of the loss of four of the caravels, which\r\nis generally admitted. Cunha, who gives the command to Jacques, most\r\nprobably alludes to the armament which that person had under his orders\r\nin the year 1516, when he proceeded to the Brazil, and then entered\r\nthe bay of All Saints.\r\n\r\nAssuming that G. Coelho was the admiral of these caravels, on\r\ntraversing the Atlantic they were driven by a severe gale to 3°\r\nsouth latitude, where a loss of four was sustained upon some rocks\r\nin the proximity of an island, which beyond a doubt was Fernando de\r\nNoronha, situated in 3° 50′ south latitude. The two remaining vessels\r\ncontinued their course to the coast of Vera or St. Cruz, and made\r\nland near a magnificent bay (Bahia), which they entered, and gave the\r\nappellation of _Todos os Santos_, (being All Saints Day.) They\r\ncoasted on southward, constantly approximating to the land, where the\r\nshore presented no obstacles, minutely inspecting all its remarkable\r\nrivers, ports, capes, and headlands, the adjacent islands, and the\r\ncoast generally, as far as Cape Virgins, near the Straits of Magellan.\r\nThey erected stone pillars, bearing the arms of Portugal, in some\r\nof the most conspicuous situations. They left at Porto Seguro, a\r\ncolony consisting of a part of the persons who had escaped from the\r\nshipwrecked vessels, with two Franciscan missionaries, and returned\r\nto Portugal laden with Brazil wood. This wood had now acquired such\r\nreputation in Europe, that the name of St. Cruz, otherwise Vera Cruz,\r\ngiven to the country by Cabral, was lost in the denomination which it\r\nuniversally received of the Brazil, (or Brazil wood country.)\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1503, before the explorer Coelho reached the land of\r\nVera Cruz, Don Affonso d’Albuquerque arrived upon the coast, having\r\nleft Lisbon, on the 6th of April, with a squadron under his command for\r\nIndia: the latitude or part of the Brazil that he saw is not stated,\r\nbut he observed the cassia and verniz trees. (“_Buona somma di cassia\r\net di vernizo, altro di momenti non abiamo compreso_”--Ramuzio.)\r\nShortly after Coelho’s return, a contract was granted for the Brazil\r\nwood, and the colony began to be frequently visited by the caravels of\r\nthe contractors.\r\n\r\nThe King of Castile despatched Juan Dias de Solis, in the year 1509;\r\nand it is said the celebrated pilot Vincente Yanez Pinson accompanied\r\nhim, to take possession of a part of the newly-discovered country, and\r\nin pursuance of this project they erected crosses upon different parts\r\nof the coast. The King of Portugal remonstrated against this proceeding\r\nas an intrusion upon his share of the division of undiscovered\r\ncountries, which Alexander VI. had very artfully assigned to those two\r\nnations. Feelings of bitter regret cannot but arise in the mind, on\r\ncontemplating, at the present day, this fine and fairest portion of the\r\nnew world, placed in such hands by an imaginary partition of unknown\r\nlands. Had this best and richest region of America fallen to the share\r\nof the English, French, or Dutch, it would no doubt have assumed a very\r\ndifferent appearance, compared with its actual state. That this would\r\nhave been the case is evident, from the present immensely superior\r\ncondition of the Anglo-American states, the territory of which was\r\ncolonized at a later period than Brazil, and whose soil is in general\r\nso inferior to the latter country. The occasion of the difference may\r\nbe mainly attributed to the very opposite genius of the governments and\r\nreligion under the English and Portuguese; the free and wise character\r\nof the former giving every facility to talent and industry of all\r\ndescriptions, while the ignorant and oppressive nature of the latter,\r\nespecially in relation to the commercial restrictions, which, till the\r\narrival of the King, had unfortunately existed, and in the domination\r\nof the priesthood over the consciences and property of the people,\r\noperating as a paralysis on agricultural, commercial, and scientific\r\nenterprise, and upon all the beneficial pursuits of the mind. It is\r\nnow, however, pleasing to observe, that a very striking change has and\r\nis taking place in these matters, the views of his present Majesty\r\nbeing favourable to the amelioration of the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1510, a Portuguese ship was wrecked at the entrance of the Bay of\r\nAll Saints. The greater part of the crew escaped, and twenty-five years\r\nafterwards nine sailors were found living amongst the Indians. Another\r\naccount affirms that they were all seized by the natives and devoured\r\nexcepting Diogo Alvarez, a man of distinguished family, who contrived\r\nto make himself useful to those cannibals; and acquired the name of\r\n“Caramura”--“a man of fire,” on his first discharging a gun, which he\r\nhad saved from the wreck.\r\n\r\nIn 1513, George Lopez Bixorda presented to King Emanuel three Brazilian\r\nIndians, whom he had brought home in a contract vessel. They were\r\ndressed with feathers, according to the fashion of their tribe.\r\n\r\nThe King of Castile ordered Solis upon a second expedition, in the year\r\n1515, with a view of discovering a western passage to India. In the\r\nprosecution of this voyage he discovered a large river, which he called\r\nthe River _Solis_. This name was very improperly superseded by the\r\nappellation of Prata, or Plate, (the Silver River.) He lost his life\r\nupon its banks by the hands of the Indians, who slew him with their\r\nclubs, and roasted and devoured him within sight of his countrymen.\r\nIn justice, the river ought to have retained his name. His death\r\nfrustrated the object of the voyage, and the ships put back, took in\r\nBrazil wood near the island of Itamaraca, and returned to Spain. The\r\nPortuguese again demanded satisfaction for this infringement, which\r\nwas at last amicably adjusted.\r\n\r\nChristovam Jacques, in the year 1516, entered the bay of All Saints\r\nwith a squadron of caravels, and in the course of exploring its\r\nextensive limits, its rivers, and creeks, he fell in with two French\r\nships, which had previously entered the bay, and were loading with\r\nBrazil wood, of which they had a considerable quantity on board, as\r\nwell as parrots and monkeys. He engaged the vessels, and after a\r\nspirited defence they were destroyed. Subsequently, it would appear\r\nfrom the testimony of a letter of donation to Pedro Lopez de Souza,\r\n(who chose Itamaraca for part of his grant,) and by one which John\r\nIII. ordered to be written to Martim Affonso de Souza, that Christovam\r\nJacques was employed in establishing a factory upon the channel which\r\nseparates the island of Itamaraca from the continent, destined to\r\nfacilitate the exportation of Brazil wood, and to impede the attempts\r\nof other nations who might visit that quarter in quest of it.\r\n\r\nDiogo Garciam, a Portuguese pilot in the service of the Castilian\r\ncourt, arrived near the mouth of the river Paraguay, in the year 1527,\r\nand found there the ships with which Sebastian Caboto had sailed\r\nfrom Cadiz, with the intention of proceeding to the Moluccas by the\r\nstraits of All Saints, now Magellan’s. He learned that the captain\r\nhad gone up the Paraguay, then River Solis, and proceeded with two\r\nlaunches much above the confluence of the Parana in pursuit of him.\r\nHe found him engaged in the construction of the fort of St. Anna,\r\nwhere they mutually agreed to give to the river Solis the name of the\r\nriver Prata, in consequence of seeing small pieces of that metal in\r\nthe possession of the Indians. Herrera states, that Diogo Garciam, on\r\nhis way to the river Solis, entered the bay of St. Vincente, (then\r\nthe River Innocentes,) where a Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked,\r\nprovided him with refreshments; also, that Garciam anchored off the\r\nisland of Patos, at the present day St. Catherine’s, where the Indians\r\nfurnished him with some provisions. He carried with him sixty men, in\r\ntwo brigantines, to the fort of St. Anna; and before his departure he\r\ndespatched one of the largest vessels of his squadron to St. Vincente,\r\nto take in a cargo, which he had agreed with the Portuguese mentioned,\r\nto be sent to Portugal. It is probable that this individual was either\r\nJoam Ramalho or Antonio Rodriguez, whom Martim Affonso de Souza found\r\nthere five years afterwards. It would appear that some Portuguese\r\nhad been established at St. Vincente some years; and the evidence of\r\nHerrera, that some Indians had been shipped from thence to Portugal\r\nin 1527, would tend to demonstrate that a factory had existed there\r\nprevious to the arrival of Martin A. de Souza, (the first donatory,)\r\nand which factory had conceded to Pedro Goes the power of shipping to\r\nPortugal a certain number of aboriginal Indians, free from all the\r\nduties which it was customary to pay. (_Forros de todos os dereitos,\r\nque custamavam pagar._) If this factory existed, neither the period\r\nof its commencement is evident, nor by whom it was established.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence which the ship of Garciam brought to Portugal, in the\r\nyear 1528, that the Spaniards had formed an establishment upon the\r\nriver Plate, induced King John III. who wished that river to become the\r\ndivisionary line, to despatch an armament, in the year 1531, under the\r\ncommand of Martim Affonso de Souza, with orders to erect fortifications\r\nand to distribute lands to those who wished to establish themselves\r\nin the country. The fleet, after having made and recognised Cape\r\nSt. Augustin, navigated along the coast and entered the bay of All\r\nSaints, where they discovered and captured two French vessels. Joam de\r\nSouza, captain of one of the ships composing the armament, was sent to\r\nannounce to the King this circumstance. Martim Affonso continued his\r\nvoyage to the south, and after refreshing at Porto Seguro, he found out\r\nand entered the bay of St. Luzia, to which he gave the name of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, in consequence of discovering it on the 1st of January, 1532.\r\nProsecuting the voyage, and always keeping as near land as possible,\r\nhe gave to the most remarkable and important places, the names of the\r\nsaints on whose days he discovered them. Having passed the island of\r\nSt. Sebastian, on the 20th of the same month, he proceeded to that\r\npart of the port where it is supposed the factory was situated, and of\r\nwhich no doubt he was previously informed. It appears, however, after\r\nvarious operations upon the northern bar of the port to establish there\r\nthe colonists, who wished to remain in the land, he changed his plan\r\nand removed them to the southern bar. He spent eleven months in the\r\nexecution of various measures upon the coast, and it was the month of\r\nDecember before he arrived at the river Plate; for the sun, say the\r\nPortuguese, was on the tropical line of Capricorn. (_O sol chegou ao\r\ntropico de Capricornio._) Not meeting with any Spanish settlements\r\nupon any part of the coast, he returned to the colony at the southern\r\nbar of the bay of Santos, augmenting it considerably, by giving lands\r\nto all individuals who determined to settle there, in pursuance of the\r\norders he had received. He sent eighty men into the interior, for the\r\npurpose of discovering or making a conquest of the mines of Cannanea.\r\nThe entire party were murdered by the _Carijos_ Indians.\r\n\r\nIn the same year that Martim Affonso sailed from the Tagus, a\r\nPortuguese squadron captured and conducted to Lisbon a ship of\r\nMarseilles, which had been laden with Brazil wood, at Pernambuco,\r\nwhere they demolished the Portuguese factory of Itamaraca, founded by\r\nC. Jacques, and left sixty Frenchmen in their place. This information\r\ninduced the King to send Duarthe Coelho Pereyra to expel the French,\r\nwhich he accomplished, and removed the factory to the margin of the\r\nriver Hyguaraçu, a few miles distant from the first situation. This\r\nnew establishment was the origin of the town of Hyguaraçu, to whose\r\nmother-church the same D. C. Pereyra, being then the donatory of the\r\ncaptaincy of Pernambuco, gave for patrons the saints Cosme and Damian,\r\nin gratitude for the expulsion of the French on the day of those\r\nsaints, in the year 1531. It may be here remarked, that very little\r\nprogress, up to this period, would appear to have been made by the\r\nPortuguese for the colonization of this country, now known to them\r\nthirty-two years, and which they had assumed the right of calling and\r\nconsidering their own.\r\n\r\nKing John III. at last roused by the attempts which the French\r\nmerchants were making to form establishments near the places now called\r\nPernambuco and Bahia, also by the formation of colonies, which the\r\nSpaniards were promoting on the banks of the Paraguay, determined to\r\npeople this continent; and, in order to facilitate the colonization,\r\nhe divided the coast into certain large portions of fifty leagues,\r\nwhich, under the denomination of capitanias, (captaincies,) were to\r\nbe bestowed on individuals distinguished by their services to the\r\ncrown; and who were to go personally, or to send colonists, in ships,\r\nat their own cost, receiving an uncontrolled jurisdiction over these\r\nroyal donations. The historian, Joam de Barros, who was one of the\r\ndonatories, and was presented with the district of Maranham, affirms\r\nthat the country was partitioned into twelve captaincies; but there\r\nwere actually only nine, as five portions which he probably took\r\ninto his account, were divided betwixt Martim Affonso de Souza and\r\nhis brother Pedro Lopez de Souza, who were the two first donatories\r\nthat settled in the Brazil. Martim Affonso, who has been previously\r\nmentioned, received a considerable tract of country contiguous to St.\r\nVincente, where we left him endeavouring to form a colony. Pedro Lopez\r\nchose his quantum of territory in two lots, one near his brother’s,\r\ncalled St. Amaro, and the other denominated Itamaraca, at a very\r\ninconvenient distance from the first, situated not far from Pernambuco,\r\nwhich latter capitania, as has been already stated, became the portion\r\nof Duarthe Coelho Pereyra. The lands adjacent to the southern Parahiba\r\nriver were conceded to Pedro de Goes. The country betwixt the great\r\nriver St. Francisco, which was the southern boundary of Pernambuco, and\r\nBahia, was allotted to Francisco Pereira Coutinho. The next portion\r\nof territory, proceeding southward, was denominated the Capitania dos\r\nIlheos, running north and south from the Rio dos Ilheos, (River of\r\nIslands,) and granted to Jorge Figueiredo Correa. Cabral’s Porto Seguro\r\nwas included in the range of coast which formed the capitania of the\r\nsame name, and was a donation to Pedro Campo Tourinha. Espirito Santo\r\n(Holy Spirit) was the appellation given to the next in rotation, and\r\nobtained by Vasco Fernandez Coutinho. Rio de Janeiro was not colonized\r\nfor some time afterwards. This mode of allotment was not calculated to\r\nmaintain a long duration. The captains possessed despotic jurisdiction\r\nover the colonists, many of whom were degradados, or criminals,\r\nconsequently less adapted to live in harmony, and the whole being at\r\nthe mercy of the former, complaints were frequent; so that, after a\r\nlapse of about seventeen years from its commencement, this system was\r\nterminated by a royal revocation of the power of the captains, followed\r\nby the appointment of Thomé de Souza, a fidalgo, as governor-general\r\nof the Brazil, who arrived at Bahia, the bay of All Saints, in April\r\n1549, with instructions to build a city, which was to be called St.\r\nSalvador. The fleet was accompanied by some Jesuits, who thus obtained\r\nin the Brazilian regions, those means of improving the condition of\r\nthe Indians, and of the country in other respects, which has been so\r\nhonourable to their Trans-Atlantic character, and which presents so\r\npleasing and striking a contrast to their conduct in Europe, filled\r\nas that conduct was with “treasons, stratagems, and spoils.” With the\r\nmother-country, this colony passed under the dominion of the Spanish\r\ncrown, in the year 1580, for a period of nearly sixty years. The Dutch\r\npossessed themselves of Pernambuco in the year 1630, and ultimately of\r\nthe whole country from the great river St. Francisco to Maranham, which\r\nthey retained till the year 1654. The last Philip, just before the\r\nBrazil reverted to the Portuguese, conferred the title of Viceroy upon\r\nthe governor-general at Bahia, who then was the Marquis of Montalvam,\r\nand which honour all his successors enjoyed. The seat of the vice-regal\r\ngovernment was transferred by Don Joseph I. from Bahia to Rio de\r\nJaneiro, in 1773, which expired on the arrival of the royal family in\r\nthat country, in the year 1808. Don John IV. gave the title of Prince\r\nof Brazil to his eldest son, Prince Don Theodosio, which descended to\r\nall the hereditary princes of the house of Braganza, till the 17th of\r\nDecember, 1815, when the Prince Regent, (now Don John VI.) raised that\r\ncountry into a kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Brazil is of such prodigious extent, that it will be impossible for\r\nit to arrive even at a medium state of perfection under the dominion\r\nof one government. Its prominent boundaries, now that Monte Video is\r\nin the possession of the Portuguese, may be geographically considered\r\nthe river Amazons and the Atlantic on the north; the river Plate on\r\nthe south; the ocean on the whole of its prolonged range of eastern\r\ncoast; and the great rivers Madeira, &c. running north; the Paraguay\r\nand Uruguay stretching south to the river Plate, on the west; although\r\nthe two provinces of Solimoes and Guianna, north of the Amazons, and\r\nactually subordinate to the governor of Para, carry its northern\r\nboundaries, politically speaking, almost as far as the Oronocos, making\r\nits length upwards of forty degrees. Its greatest width is about thirty\r\ndegrees, from Cape St. Augustin to Point Abuná, upon the margin of the\r\nriver Madeira.\r\n\r\nThis vast region, comprising nearly two millions of square miles, is\r\nnow divided into twenty-two provinces, including the two mentioned\r\nabove, viz.\r\n\r\n    Guianna           }\r\n    Para              }\r\n    Maranham          }\r\n    Siará             }\r\n    Rio Grande, North }\r\n    Parahiba          }\r\n    Pernambuco        } All bordering in\r\n    Seregipe d’El Rey }   part upon the\r\n    Bahia             }   coast.\r\n    Porto Seguro      }\r\n    Espirito Santo    }\r\n    Rio de Janeiro    }\r\n    St. Paulo         }\r\n    St. Catharina     }\r\n    Rio Grande, South }\r\n\r\n    Mato Grosso  }\r\n    Paraná       }\r\n    Uruguay      }\r\n    Solimoes     } Interior provinces.\r\n    Piauhy       }\r\n    Minas Geraes }\r\n    Goyaz        }\r\n\r\nThe zoology and phytology of this country extend to such an infinity\r\nof objects, that they would form a separate history of themselves.\r\nThey, as well as mineralogy, will be partially treated upon in the\r\ntopography of each province. In reference to the first subject, it\r\nmay be here observed, that a very considerable portion of the Brazil\r\nis still occupied by Indians, consisting of a vast number of nations,\r\nmore or less numerous, and generally divided into tribes or hordes,\r\nwandering about in a state of nudity, the principal part of their\r\ntime employed in hunting, gathering honey, and such fruits as nature\r\nspontaneously produces. They believe in the immortality of the soul\r\nand a Creator of all, whom they commonly denominate _Tupan_,\r\nand, like many other barbarians, their adoration is divided between\r\nthe good and evil spirit, which latter they call _Anhanga_. No\r\nstate of government is found amongst them; each tribe has its elective\r\ncaptain, who directs them only on occasions of assaults and in forming\r\nambuscades against an enemy. Each nation has its peculiar idiom,\r\nbut there is one exists amongst them denominated the general lingua,\r\nwhich is the _Tupinamba_. At this day many tribes retain the\r\nancient custom of perforating their faces and using pieces of wood as\r\nornaments. In contracting marriages, the degree of relationship is not\r\nrespected. Polygamy is admitted amongst particular individuals only, in\r\na very few nations. Divorcements are generally very rare amongst them.\r\nThey are acquainted with no liberal art, and have a great antipathy\r\nto civilization. Thousands of instances have occurred, in which they\r\nhave preferred fleeing from it back again into the woods, in pursuit\r\nof their former rude habits. The governor of one of the comarcas of\r\nMinas Geraes related to me an instance of an Indian who, instructed\r\nin the Catholic faith, had actually entered upon the functions of a\r\npriest, and who, notwithstanding, was afterwards induced, from the\r\nnatural bent of his mind, to abscond and rejoin his uncivilized tribe.\r\nTheir inherent indolence is conspicuous, and they have but little\r\nconsideration in life beyond the acquirement of their daily sustenance.\r\nFrequent instances occur of their assassinating some of the Portuguese,\r\nfor whom they lie in ambush. The Portuguese almost universally provide\r\nthemselves with fire-arms, on traversing the districts inhabited by\r\nthe Indians, at which they are greatly terrified. Such as live upon\r\nthe banks of auriferous rivers or lands, and come in contact with the\r\nPortuguese, will give pieces of gold for trifling articles of European\r\nmanufacture, particularly knives, the metal of which they consider of\r\nsuch value, that, in sharpening them, they do not use a whetstone,\r\nbut a piece of wood, in order that the blade may experience as little\r\ndiminution as possible by the operation. Few Indians are seen in any\r\nof the seaport-towns of the Brazil. Some are employed in the bay of\r\nRio de Janeiro, rowing boats in the service of the government. They\r\nappear to keep themselves quite distinct, and do not mix with any\r\nother class of people. They are not tall, but their early occupation\r\nof hunting has given to their limbs much strength and agility. A\r\nfine proportion of form is their general characteristic, and they\r\npossess great muscular powers. Their features are regular, and there\r\nis an universal resemblance between them and the various tribes.\r\nThey are of a copper-colour, with strong, lank, black hair, which\r\nis permitted to hang over their ears, necks, and foreheads, adding\r\nsomething to the sombre aspect of their countenances, which are sad\r\neven to an extreme. If they were capable of learning from history, and\r\nappreciating with feelings of patriotism the force of such an event, it\r\nmight naturally appear to be a dejection originating in the corroding\r\nidea of the conquest of their country by strangers; but this apparent\r\ncharacteristic melancholy can only be the result of, and founded upon,\r\ntheir former habits of life and precarious mode of subsistence; which\r\nhaving once contracted, and possessing an innate aversion to civilized\r\nintercourse, may never totally disappear. There is nothing ferocious in\r\ntheir physiognomy; on the contrary, they seem very inoffensive. I never\r\nsaw them indulge in any gaiety, rarely laughing, and speaking seldom.\r\nThey are expert rowers, and on a transient cessation from their labour,\r\nexhibit no disposition to hold converse with each other, nor curiosity\r\nor interest in the objects and bustle around them. The Jesuits were\r\nundoubtedly the best class of ecclesiastics who have hitherto visited\r\nthe Brazil, not only, as has been observed, in initiating the Indians\r\ninto Christianity, but in the general pursuit and encouragement of\r\nliterature. The missions, for which they were so celebrated, will come\r\nunder consideration in treating of the provinces where they instituted\r\nthem; also the establishments of Christianized Indians, as well as the\r\nnumerous savage tribes existing at the present day.\r\n\r\nAs the colonization of the capitania of Rio de Janeiro did not\r\noccur till after the Brazil was placed under the jurisdiction of a\r\ngovernor-general, and no allusion having been made to that event in the\r\ncourse of these preliminary observations, besides having long assumed\r\nthe highest rank amongst the provinces of the Brazil, it naturally\r\npresents itself first in order, as well as the circumstances arising\r\nout of a residence in its capital, for our consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP.

Martini\r\nAlfonso de Souza, who was engaged in an exploration of the whole coast,\r\nwent into the bay on the 1st of January, 1532, and very improperly\r\ngave it the name, which it yet retains, of Rio de Janeiro, (River of\r\nJanuary,) evincing, what would not be supposed to be possible, that\r\nhe considered it a river. No attempts were made, however, to form any\r\nsettlements here till the year 1555, when M. Villegagnon, a Frenchman,\r\nwho had rescued Queen Mary from Scotland, with his comrades, took\r\npossession of the second island, after passing the entrance into\r\nthe bay. His avowed object was that of propagating Calvinism in the\r\nnew world. On this island, which took and still retains his name,\r\nhe constructed the fort of Coligni, in honour of the excellent man\r\nand famous admiral, Gaspar de Coligni, his patron and warm supporter\r\nin establishing this colony, to which, in the following year, he\r\ndespatched a further succour of three ships of war and near three\r\nhundred persons. King John III. of Portugal, receiving intelligence of\r\nthis event, ordered Duarthe da Costa, then governor-general at Bahia,\r\nindividually, to make himself acquainted with the actual state of the\r\nProtestants; but no attempts were made to displace them till after\r\nthe death of the King, when Dona Catharina gave instructions to Mendo\r\nde Sa, the successor of Duarthe da Costa, to expel them, sending him\r\ntwo armed ships, with some caravels, which the governor augmented by\r\nsome ships of war and two caravels that were in the port, and putting\r\non board all the people he could assemble, personally embarked with\r\nthe squadron. He visited all the intervening capitanias of the coast,\r\nand received on board all those who were willing to accompany him.\r\nThe French defended themselves vigorously against the attacks of this\r\nfleet; but not being able to remedy the destruction and havoc which\r\nthey sustained from the more powerful ships of the Portuguese, they\r\nretired by night to the continent, uniting themselves with the Tamoyo\r\nIndians, whose friendship they had previously conciliated. Mendo de Sa\r\ncollected the artillery which the French had left, and, with one of\r\ntheir ships, which he found in the port, he returned to Bahia.\r\n\r\nIntelligence was received afresh that the Protestants continued to\r\nfrequent the bay of Rio de Janeiro, and were successively becoming\r\nmore strongly fortified in the continental situations they had taken\r\nup. The crown of Portugal, now discovering of how much importance it\r\nwould be effectually to take possession of and colonize this fine port,\r\nwhich having no donatory or forces to impede the establishment of\r\nwhatever enemy might think proper to proceed there for that purpose,\r\nresolved to despatch Estacio de Sa to Bahia, with two galliots, and\r\nthere to receive from his uncle, Mendo de Sa, the governor, such an\r\naccession of force as would enable him to extirpate the French. Estacio\r\nde Sa, having augmented the squadron as much as circumstances would\r\nallow, arrived at Rio de Janeiro in 1565, and took up a station near\r\nthe Sugar-Loaf Mountain, at the place now called Villa Velha; but in\r\nvarious attacks, which he made upon the united French and Indians,\r\nfortune was never decisively propitious to him. This circumstance\r\ninduced Mendo de Sa to prepare, in the bay of Bahia, an armament, which\r\nconsisted of three galliots, commanded by Christovam de Barros, two\r\nships of the crown, which were cruizing on the coast, and six caravels.\r\nThis auxiliary force he accompanied in person to the assistance of his\r\nnephew, visiting, as before, the intervening capitanias, and offering\r\nto convey, gratuitously, all families who might wish to people the\r\nfuture colony; and, in consequence, a great many did accompany him. He\r\narrived on the 18th of January, 1567, but deferred the attack till the\r\n20th, that day being St. Sebastian’s, under whose auspices he meant\r\nto begin and carry on the enterprise. Two years had previously passed\r\nin useless and indecisive contention, which, in two days, Mendo de\r\nSa brought to a successful termination, by possessing himself of the\r\nforts Urussumiri and Paranapucuy, not, however, without his followers\r\nfeeling the effect of the arrows of the Tamoyos, which often transfixed\r\nthe shield to the arm that supported it. Amongst others, Estacio de\r\nSa received a wound from one of them, of which he expired a few days\r\nafterwards. The French escaped in four ships which they had in the\r\nharbour; and Mendo de Sa did not allow much time to elapse before he\r\nremoved the first establishment to the situation now forming a ward\r\nor district of the present capital, denominated Misericordia, and\r\nthere marked out its commencement. In honour of his patron saint,\r\nhe gave it the name of St. Sebastian, which has given way to that\r\nof Rio de Janeiro now more generally used. The governor assigned to\r\nthe celebrated Jesuit, Nobrega, ground, in the midst of the city,\r\nfor a college, which he endowed for the support of fifty brethren.\r\nHaving occupied himself near a year and a half in arranging every\r\nthing necessary for the continuation and security of the new city, he\r\nreturned to the capital in June, 1568. He left for governor his nephew,\r\nSalvador Corrêa de Sa, whose administration was short, as well as that\r\nof Christovam de Barros, who succeeded him by royal patent, and whose\r\njurisdiction over the affairs of the capitania terminated in 1572, when\r\nKing Sebastian divided the state into two governments; the city of St.\r\nSebastian becoming the capital of the southern division, which was\r\ndelivered to Dr. Antonio Salema, with power over the capitanias from\r\nthe river Belmont, southward. The same sovereign, becoming sensible of\r\nthe inconvenience resulting to the crown from this partition, ordered\r\nthat the general executive government should revert to its anterior\r\nstate; and nominated, as successor to Salema, the said Salvador Corrêa\r\nde Sa, with patent of captain-general, dated the 10th January, 1576,\r\nand who remained in this situation until the year 1598. None of those\r\nwho followed him governed during so long a period, with the exception\r\nof Sandozo Gomes Freyre d’Andrade, who discharged the duties of the\r\nappointment from the year 1733 to 1763, and which expired only with his\r\nlife in the course of the latter year.\r\n\r\nThis province, which acquires its name from the magnificent port of\r\nits capital, now comprehends the ci-devant capitania of St. Thomé,\r\nhalf of that of St. Vincente, and a portion of Espirito Santo. It is\r\nbounded on the north by the latter, from which it is separated by the\r\nriver Cabapuâna, and by the province of Minas Geraes, from which it is\r\ndivided by the rivers Preto and Parahiba, and in part by the serra of\r\nMantiqueira; on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, which also washes its\r\neastern limits; and on the west by the province of St. Paulo. It is\r\nestimated to be sixty leagues in length, from east to west, near its\r\nnorthern extremity; and twenty-three leagues of medium width, reckoning\r\nfrom the fortress of St. Cruz, at the entrance of the bay of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, to the river Parahibuna, and to have fifty leagues of southern\r\ncoast, from Cape Frio to Cape Trinidade, which is near three leagues to\r\nthe west of Point Joatinga. It is divided by the Organ Mountains into\r\ntwo parts; Northern, or Serra-Acima, (Mountains above,) and Southern,\r\nor Beira-Mar, (Sea-coast,) which latter is subdivided into four, and\r\nthe former into two districts or territories, as follows:--\r\n\r\n              { Ilha Grande.\r\n    Beira-Mar { Rio de Janeiro.\r\n              { Cape Frio.\r\n              { Goytacazes.\r\n\r\n    Serra-Acima { Parahiba-Nova.\r\n                { Canto-Gallo.\r\n\r\nA line drawn from south to north, commencing at the fort of Lage, at\r\nthe entrance of the port of Rio, passing up the middle of the bay, by\r\nthe river Inhumirim upwards, and on to the origin of the Piabanha,\r\ndescending by it to the Parahiba, divides the province into east and\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--All the districts of this province, with the\r\nexception of Goytacazes, are picturesquely mountainous, and present\r\nan infinite variety of novel, sublime, and wondrous scenery, of which\r\nno verbal description can give an adequate representation. The Organ\r\nMountains, so called from the similarity which their pyramidical heads,\r\nin various parts, bear to the front of an organ, are the principal.\r\nThat portion of them which assimilates more distinctly to the object\r\nfrom which the whole range derives the name is an approximation\r\nof precipitous pointed masses, separated by profound winding and\r\nnarrow valleys, through which romantic openings the way leads from\r\nBeira-Mar to the district of Canto-Gallo, without having to ascend any\r\ncomparatively high elevations in traversing them. This is, indeed, the\r\nregion of solemn and poetic sequestration. Its unchanged and primeval\r\ncondition would appear to afford a suitable retirement for such as have\r\nacquired a calamity-induced distortion of the mind,--a misanthropical\r\ndistaste to society and the world.\r\n\r\nThe Macacu, otherwise Serra-Grande, (Great Mountain,) the mountains\r\nof St. Anne, of Sambe, of Tapacora, and of Urussanga, are situated in\r\nthat extremity betwixt the districts of Rio de Janeiro and Cape Frio;\r\nthe Mount of St. Joam, a league above the emboucheur of the river of\r\nthe same name, the Serra Jarixina, about twenty miles north-west of\r\nthe capital, and that of Bocaina, in the district of Parahiba-Nova,\r\nconstitute, together with the Organ Mountains, those of the greatest\r\naltitude in the province.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--It cannot boast of any very large or magnificent\r\nrivers, although it is irrigated by innumerable streams descending\r\nfrom the mountains. The river Parahiba is the only considerable one,\r\noriginating in a small lake, situated upon a southern portion of the\r\nSerra Bocaina, a continuation of the Organ range, and about five\r\nleagues to the north of Paraty. It runs at first under the name of\r\nParatinga, parallel with the mountains prolonged in piles from the\r\nsouth-west, in a line with the coast; enters the province of St.\r\nPaulo, where it receives the small river Jacuhy, by the left bank, a\r\nlittle above the town of St. Luiz, and somewhat below it, by the same\r\nmargin, the river Parahibuna, which rises in the serra of Ubatuba. At\r\nthis confluence it takes the name of Parahiba, approximates the sea a\r\nlittle to the west of the meridian of the capital, then turns towards\r\nthe north-north-east, flowing along the base of Serra Itapeva, and by\r\nthe town of Jacarehy. After a course of twenty leagues, with little\r\nvariation, it inclines to the east and east-south-east, watering the\r\ntowns of Thaubate, Pindamonhangaba, Guaratingueta, and Lorena; again\r\nturns towards the province in which it has its source, approaching\r\nit within five leagues; bathes the town of Rezende; inclines to the\r\nnorth-east, gathering the river Pirahy, (which comes in a northern\r\ncourse from its origin in the serra of Ilha Grande,) and many\r\nleagues lower, having taken an easterly direction, it receives the\r\nParahibuna which is its largest confluent, by the left margin, and the\r\nafore-mentioned Piabanha, by the right. This part is designated Tres\r\nRios, (Three Rivers.) Ten leagues below, the Pomba enters it by the\r\nnorthern bank, which flows from the western part of the Serra Frecheira\r\nprincipally in a south-east course, through a stony bed, rendering the\r\nnavigation difficult even to canoes. A little lower it receives the\r\nBengálas, which brings with it various other streams. Soon after this\r\njunction, it descends the precipitous fall of St. Fideles, to which\r\npoint barks ascend. Eight leagues lower down, the Muriahe empties\r\nitself into it by the northern margin. Six leagues may be computed\r\nfrom this confluence to the emboucheur of the river Parahiba, and from\r\nthence to the fall of St. Fideles, which is the first advancing up the\r\nriver, seventy-two islands are numbered; and above this fall they\r\nare still more numerous. Its waters are precipitated by a great many\r\nfalls, which run principally through a stony bed, and are discharged\r\ninto the Atlantic, on the eastern coast of the province. This river\r\ndoes not bring with it to the ocean so large a volume of water as\r\nmight be imagined from its vast extent, which may be accounted for by\r\nits running principally betwixt two cordilleras, (the Organ Mountains\r\nand the Mantiqueira with their branches,) the greatest interval of\r\nwhich does not exceed twenty leagues, and almost all its tributary\r\nstreams are poor and inconsiderable. Eight leagues below Lorêna, where\r\nit has already assumed the appearance of a large river, its course\r\nis contracted by a long wall of rock, of more than sixty feet high\r\nand six hundred yards in extent, reducing its channel to the width of\r\nabout ten yards. It abounds in a great variety of fish. The adjacent\r\nterritory, on both banks, from its source to its mouth, is considered\r\nto be well adapted for the growth of the sugar cane, and the very small\r\npart of it which is cultivated, is appropriated to that purpose; but\r\nthe far greatest proportion yet remains in a state of wild nature, and\r\nalthough perhaps granted to different donatories, its impenetrable\r\nwoods form the native retreat of the Indian and the ounce, each still\r\nasserting the claim of possession. The river Maccahe, which has a\r\ncourse of fifteen leagues, affording ten leagues of navigation to a\r\nfall, rises in the Organ range, and winds amongst mountains and woods,\r\ntill it encounters the St. Pedro, formed by various small streams in\r\nthe vicinity of Serra Frade. Three leagues may be computed from this\r\nconfluence to its emboucheur, which is in front of the islands of St.\r\nAnna, thirty miles north of Cape Frio, dividing that district from\r\nGoytacazes. The river St. Joam rises in the skirts of the rock of\r\nCanudos, with the name of _Aguas Claras_, (Clear Waters,) more\r\nconsiderable, and affording navigation for a greater space than the\r\nMaccahe, runs like it amongst woods and mountains, and disembogues\r\nabout seven leagues to the south-west of it, bathing the southern\r\nskirts of the mountain of its name. Large quantities of timber are\r\nexported by it. The rivers Curubichas and Bannanal join it by the\r\nleft bank, the Bacaxa, which issues from the Serra St. Anna with the\r\nappellation of _Rio do Oiro_, (the Gold River,) unites it on the\r\nright by two mouths, having formed, a little higher, a large lake, into\r\nwhich the Capivari, coming from the same serra, empties itself. Below\r\nthis confluence, little more than three leagues, the Ipuca disembogues,\r\nrises near the Maccahe, and forms a considerable island. After it the\r\nLontra, and ultimately the Doirado, near which there is a remarkable\r\nproduction, called the _jiquitiba_ tree, its trunk being fifty-six\r\nspans in circumference. All three are navigable, and incorporate\r\nthemselves with the river St. Joam, by its northern margin.\r\n\r\nThe river Guandu takes its name at the confluence of the St. Anna with\r\nthe das Lages, the courses of which are in an opposite direction to\r\nthis point; the first issues from the Organ Mountains, near the heads\r\nof the river Piabanha, and runs south-west till it encounters the\r\nother, which flows north-east from its origin in the frontier serra\r\nof Ilha Grande. The Guandu passes the royal palace (ex-Jesuitical)\r\nof St. Cruz, and discharges itself by two mouths into the bay of\r\nMarambaya. The early possessors of this part of the country, in order\r\nto evitate the damage which they sustained by the inundations of this\r\nriver, submerging the extensive and fine campinhas (plains) of the\r\nsouthern part, opened a trench of two miles long from it to the small\r\nriver Taguahy, which runs in a parallel direction, and by this mode\r\ndischarged the excess of water which the banks of the Guandu could not\r\ncontain at the period of the floods. The western mouth, or that of\r\nTaguahy, is little more than a league distant from the proper one of\r\nthe Guandu: barks navigate both. The river Mambucâba, which is a fine\r\nriver, even beyond the point where the tide reaches, issues from the\r\nserra of Bocaina, and disembogues in front of the bar of Cayrussu.\r\n\r\nLAKES.--Lakes are numerous in this province. The principal\r\nare situated in the districts of Cape Frio and Goytacazes; many of\r\nthem are surrounded by marshy lands, and none possess, in any point\r\nof view, the attractions peculiar to such diffusions of inland water\r\nin Europe. The lake of Jacaré-pagua, or Jaracapauha, is narrow and\r\nabout four leagues long, parallel with and very near to the beach. It\r\nabounds with fish, receives some small streams, and has an outlet to\r\nthe sea at its eastern extremity. It is situated at the eastern base of\r\nthe picturesque and lofty mountain of the Gavea, about two leagues to\r\nthe west of the Sugar-Loaf. At its opposite base is the beautiful and\r\nhighly pleasing cascades of Tejuca.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Roderigo de Freytas is of a circular form, and half\r\na league in diameter; is about two miles distant from the bay\r\nof Bota-fogo, and five from the capital. In its vicinity is the\r\nmother-church of the parish of St. Joam Baptista; also the royal\r\nmanufactory of gunpowder, and a botanical garden of trees and exotic\r\nplants. The tea plant is here cultivated, and, unquestionably, would\r\nprosper in this climate with proper attention; but this establishment,\r\nupon the whole, is miserably neglected. The lake of Marica, which is\r\na league and a half in length, from north-east to south-east, and\r\nlittle less in width, communicates with that of Cururupina, nearly of\r\nequal length from east to west, and about the same width from north to\r\nsouth. They both approach very much to a triangular form. The channel\r\nwhich unites them is called the river Bambuhy, and forms a small lake\r\nin the centre. The Cururupina is the eastern one, and its extremity\r\nis near Negra Point, which is at an equal distance betwixt Cape Frio\r\nand the Sugar-Loaf Mountain. The rivulet of Bananal, and that from\r\nwhich it takes its name, are the largest streams that enter it. The\r\nMarica, under which name the small one is also comprehended, receives\r\nat its southern end the Baccahi, which half a league above its mouth\r\ntraverses the lake Braba, about a mile long. The small river Itapitiu\r\nenters its northern extremity. It is prolonged in a parallel line; and\r\nat a short distance from the sea, to which it opens a passage in the\r\nwinter or rainy season, possesses a great abundance of excellent fish,\r\nand, in consequence, furnishes a branch of the _dizimos_ (a tax\r\nof one-tenth) of the province. The lake of Piratininga, three-quarters\r\nof a league from east to west, and proportionably wide, is about a\r\nmile distant from the Sacco, or Gulph of St. Joam de Carahi; it is\r\nalso abundant in fish, and is separated from the sea by a sand-bank,\r\nthrough which a passage is opened in the rainy season, to prevent its\r\ninundating the adjacent country. Near half a league to the east of\r\nPiratininga is situated the lake Itaypu, a mile and a half long, and\r\nof proportionable width; and betwixt it and the sea is the parish of\r\nthe same name, the church of which is dedicated to St. Sebastian. Its\r\ninhabitants are fishermen and cultivators of mandioca and sugar.\r\n\r\nBAYS.--This province can boast of two as fine ports as any in the\r\nworld, the bays of Rio de Janeiro and of Angra dos Reys (King’s bay,\r\nor creek.) The first is upwards of twenty leagues from Cape Frio, and,\r\nof all others in South America, merits most properly the denomination\r\nof a bay; its narrow entrance, embosomed in lofty scenery of the\r\nbeautiful and sublime, being about eight hundred and fifty fathoms\r\nin width, and fourteen in depth, while the bay itself, which is six\r\nleagues in length, almost north and south, four at its greatest width,\r\nand thirty-two in circumference, is beautified with a great number of\r\nislands, and has depth for the reception of the largest fleets. It may\r\nbe said to be divided into two emboucheurs, as the island of Lage,\r\noccupied by a fort of the same name, is situated about the centre. The\r\nentrance of the bay is commanded by the additional fort of St. Cruz,\r\non the east, and the batteries of St. Joze and St. Theodozio, on the\r\nwestern side, near an immense naked rock, already mentioned, which is\r\nninety-seven fathoms in perpendicular altitude, and is in the form\r\nof a sugar-loaf, and so denominated. The fort of St. Cruz is situated\r\nat the base of a high rugged mountain, called Pico, in consequence of\r\nits having a pointed termination. From hence signals are made to the\r\ncity, announcing all vessels as they appear upon the horizon. The two\r\nprincipal bays that branch from it are, Bota-fogo, behind the batteries\r\nof St. Jose and St. Theodozio, and the larger one of Jurufuba, to the\r\nnorth of Fort St. Cruz. Upon the beach of the latter is situated the\r\nparish of St. Joam de Carahi. The first discovery of this bay and the\r\norigin of its improper name have been already alluded to; its more\r\nappropriate and primitive name was _Nitherohy_. Lery, who was there\r\nwith Villegagnon, says, that the Indians then called it _Ganabara_;\r\nbut the first is the most suitable, “_nithero_” signifying concealed,\r\nor hidden, and “_hy_” water, as it is only on arriving in front of\r\nthe inlet that the bay is discovered, being previously concealed by\r\nmountains. This bay is the receptacle of a vast number of rivers,\r\nprincipally inconsiderable; but, as they are the medium of an easy\r\nconveyance to the capital of the productions in their vicinity, it\r\nmay not be unimportant to describe those of the most consequence. Two\r\nleagues and a half, in a direct line, or four by the road towards\r\nCampinha, is the mouth of the river Iraja, which issues from one of\r\nthe small lakes, and affords navigation with the tide to its port of\r\nthe same name. A quarter of a league to the north of the preceding,\r\nthe Miriti enters the bay, increased by the junction of the Inhamuahi,\r\n(which issues from the Serra Bangu,) and the Pavuna, about two leagues\r\nand a half distant from its mouth. It traverses a country in a great\r\nmeasure marshy, and is only navigable for the space of three miles,\r\nin a direct line to the port which takes its name, where cases of\r\nsugar, and the produce of St. Joam and Our Lady of Apezentacâo, are\r\nput on board the bay boats. About a league to the north of it is the\r\nSarapuhi, which originates in the Serra Cachoeira. Its banks are\r\nserpentine, and it is only navigable for about a league. The dwellers\r\nin the parishes of St. Antonio and Jacutinga export their productions\r\nby it. The Iguassu, a mile further to the north-east, has its source\r\nin the Serra Tinguá; is navigable for four leagues; brings with it to\r\nthe bay the waters of the Iguare, which issues from one of the lakes,\r\nand affords navigation for a mile to the port bearing its name. Also\r\nthe Maraby, flowing from the Serra Boa-Vista, and navigable to the\r\nport of Couto, three leagues above its mouth. It also receives the Dos\r\nRamos, navigable for a space of eight miles, to the skirts of the Serra\r\nMantiqueira, in which it originates. The river Inhumirim enters the\r\nbay about half a league further, and is navigable for three leagues:\r\none of its confluents, the Jaguamirim, flows from the morasses, and\r\naffords navigation for six miles; another, the Saracuruna, descends\r\nfrom the serra of its name, and is navigable only for a league; also\r\nthe Figueyra, which comes from Serra Frade. Boats go up very near to\r\nits origin, where it has the name of Cayoába. By the Inhumirim, (the\r\nsource of which is little distant from the Piabanha,) the miners,\r\namounting to no great number, comparatively, descend by boats to the\r\ncapital, and return in the same way, with manufactured articles, up its\r\nchannel to the port of Estrella, where they leave the mules to recruit\r\nfor the return journey; but the major part of these people, as well as\r\nothers, proceed the whole way with the mules. The port of Estrella is\r\na flourishing place, (being on the main way to the mines,) with some\r\nlittle commerce, and has a chapel of Our Lady, situated in the angle of\r\nthe confluence of the aforesaid Saracuruna, four miles from the bay.\r\n\r\nFrom the Inhumirim there is a channel to the river Pilar, the last\r\nconfluent of the Iguassu. Little more than two leagues to the\r\neast-north-east of the Inhumirim, and in front of the small island of\r\nGuayanna, the Suruhy, issuing from the Organ Mountains, discharges\r\nitself into the bay, and, like the others, admits of the navigation of\r\nboats up its channel for about seven miles. It receives the Goya, which\r\ncomes from one of the morasses. All the productions of the adjacent\r\ncountry are excellent; and there is, perhaps, no soil better adapted\r\nfor banana groves, which are cultivated here with great care. Half a\r\nleague further is the mouth of the Iriry, which originates in marshy\r\nground, and is only navigable for two miles.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles to the east of the Iriry, is the emboucheur of the\r\nMagéassú, which descends from the Organ Mountains, bathes the town of\r\nthe same name, and affords navigation for ten miles. The Guapimirim,\r\nis about two miles from the Magé. Its course is about six leagues, and\r\noriginates in the same mountains.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles from hence is the principal of two mouths by which\r\nthe Macacu enters the bay. It is one of its largest streams, and is\r\nnavigable for fifteen leagues. Alligators of a very large size inhabit\r\nits banks, and take shelter amongst the high reeds which grow in the\r\nwater. Its source is in the Organ Mountains, near the rock called\r\nCanudos, and it is united on its right margin by the rivers Guapiassu,\r\nCabucu, and Varge; on its left by the Cacerebu and the Aldeia. The\r\nGuapiassu, which is the most considerable, comes from the same\r\nmountains as the Macacu; and, a little before its incorporation with\r\nthat river, communicates with it by a channel called Rio dos Morros\r\n(River of Rocks.) There is a quarry of _pedra sabāo_, a peculiar\r\nstone, near its heads, which is excavated in large pieces, and sawn\r\nfor the purpose of forming the mouths of furnaces in _engenhos_,\r\nor sugar-works, being considered of eternal duration. The principal\r\nconfluent of this tributary river is Piracinunga, the main branch\r\nof which originates between the high points of the Organ Mountains.\r\nBetwixt the rivers Macacu and Guapiassu there is a certain portion\r\nof territory, comprising about two leagues, the most fertile in the\r\ndistrict, which was bequeathed, in 1718, by André da Costa, as a\r\nlegacy to some poor persons, with inalienable succession, and an\r\nannual pension of two missas, (masses,) for each house. This colony\r\nhas now arrived at the number of twelve hundred individuals, and this\r\nbequest would maintain ten times as many, with adequate industry.\r\nThe Guaxindiba flows from the Serra Taypu, and, describing numerous\r\nwindings and turnings, enters the bay about two miles from the Macacu.\r\nThe Emboassu, disemboguing four miles further, has its source in the\r\nSerra St. Gonçalo, and is navigable with the tide for a short distance.\r\n\r\nThe islands with which this bay is ornamented are numerous, but of\r\ninconsiderable extent. The principal is the isle of Governador,\r\nwhich is little more than two leagues long, from east to west, and\r\nproportionably wide. It is of an irregular form, having many headlands,\r\nand small creeks, and forms the parish of Our Lady of Ajuda. The\r\nparishioners are generally agriculturists and labourers. It is situated\r\nalmost in the middle of the bay. The isle of Bom Jesus, but better\r\nknown by the name of Frades, is about two miles long, from east to\r\nwest, and of trifling width. It is the site of a convent of lazy\r\nFranciscans, which has a handsome and commanding appearance. The King\r\nvisits the island occasionally, on the celebration of some particular\r\nreligious festivity. He spent two or three days with the friars in\r\nthe summer of 1819. It is not far distant from his palace of St.\r\nChristovao. The island of Paqueta possesses more natural charms than\r\nany other in the bay, and is situated near its northern extremity. It\r\nis about three miles long, from north to south, and of inconsiderable\r\nwidth. Its whole extent constitutes the parish of Bom Jesus do Monte\r\n(Good Jesus of the Mount.) A considerable quantity of the timber and\r\nbranches of the mango tree is exported to the capital for firewood.\r\n\r\nAngra dos Reys, the other bay alluded to, is much larger than that\r\nof Rio, presenting less regularity, with three entrances open to the\r\nsouth, formed by two islands, Ilha Grande and Marambaya, lying in\r\na parallel line with the coast. The western entrance, denominated\r\nCayrussu, is situated betwixt Ilha Grande and Joatinga Point, on\r\nthe continent. Bom-Abrigo (Good Shelter) was the name given by the\r\nfirst discoverers to this point. The entrance is eight miles wide,\r\npossessing thirty fathoms of depth. The central entrance is betwixt the\r\nsaid island and that of Marambaya, from which latter it derives its\r\nname. It is five miles wide, with little less depth than the first. The\r\neastern entrance, denominated the Bar of Guaratiba, is narrow and of\r\nlittle depth. The rivers Guandu and Mambucaba are the principal amongst\r\na great many whose courses terminate in this bay, which can boast of\r\nsome excellent roadsteads. Ilha Grande is four leagues long, with a\r\nproportionable width, having many high mountains covered with wild\r\nand verdant woods, and numerous fountains of crystalline water, which\r\nproduce two abundant streams. This bay has various recesses, which are\r\nso many secure anchorage places; the creeks of Abraham, Estrella, and\r\nPalmas are the best. This island, which lends its name to the frontier\r\nterritory of the continent, has a fertile soil, and is partially\r\ncultivated. In the year 1811, its population amounted to three thousand\r\nsouls, at which period the parish called St. Anna was created: a\r\ncentral chapel, of the same name, serves it for a mother-church. In the\r\ncreek of Abraham there is a village, which, most probably, at a future\r\nday, will become the capital of the island. The island of Marambaya is\r\nhigh and rocky, and overspread with wood. The whole of its cultivation\r\nand population arises alone from the establishment of two sugar works\r\nupon it; and it possesses a hermitage of Our Lady of Griefs (_das\r\nDores_.) From this island, a narrow sand-bank stretches to the east\r\nfor six leagues, as far as the bar of Guaratiba, and is covered in the\r\ngreatest part with vegetation.\r\n\r\nOver the bay of Angra dos Reys, a vast number of islands are scattered,\r\namongst which may be enumerated the Supituba, Cunhambyba Grande, Jorge,\r\nPalmeira, Algodao, Barra, Caeyra, Redonda, Rafael, Cavaco, Pimenta,\r\nand another, also called Jorge, which are each from about a mile to\r\ntwo miles in length. The Gipoya, about six miles long, has some indigo\r\nworks and fisheries; the Bomfim, very small, has a hermitage of the\r\nsame name; the Tacoativa, Jacarahy, Paixao, Francisco Nunes, Barro,\r\nPedreiro, Bayacica, Cana, Porcos, Sappe, Boqueirao, Redonda, Buzios,\r\nCasca, Brandao, Coco, Algodao, Ferreira, Cavaco, Jappam, Papagayos,\r\nCobras, Sandre, and St. Joam are all small. The majority of these\r\nislands are partly cultivated and peopled.\r\n\r\nCAPES.--Cape Frio is the only remarkable cape of the province.\r\nThat of St. Thomé is situated about twenty leagues north-north-east\r\nfrom it. The principal projecting points are Negra Point, nine\r\nleagues to the west of Cape Frio; Buzios Point, four leagues to the\r\nnorth-north-east of the same cape; and Guaratiba Point, near the\r\nbar of its name. The mother-church of the parish of St. Salvador is\r\nbeautifully situated upon a small eminence in front of the bar of\r\nGuaratiba. Its district is twenty miles long, and fifteen wide. In\r\nthe year 1804, it contained four thousand three hundred and forty\r\ninhabitants, dispersed over the parish, the vicar’s house being almost\r\nthe only one in the vicinity of the church.\r\n\r\nISLANDS.--The islands of this province are numerous, but\r\nthe greater part inconsiderable, and principally within the two bays\r\nalready described. Outside of the bar of Rio de Janeiro are the three\r\nislands of Palmas; also the islands of Redonda, Comprida, Raza, Cagada,\r\nLage, Catunduda, Toacinho, Pay, and May; the whole of which are small,\r\nuninhabited, and extremely barren, except in verdant shrubs and\r\nbrushwood.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--This province has some mines of gold, and possesses\r\nveins of iron. The rocks of granite are very large and remarkable,\r\nbeing of one solid piece, from whence entire obelisks might be hewn\r\nof an immense size. Aqua-marinas are met with; and a variety of\r\ndifferent earths, some considered equal to that with which the Chinese\r\nmanufacture their porcelain.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--In this province are found all the domestic and wild\r\nanimals belonging to the adjacent provinces, with a sort of Sahium\r\nmonkey, hairy, and of a gold colour. Amongst the birds are remarked\r\nvarious sorts of the beautiful sahy, not met with northward.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--This province affords a variety of timber for\r\nthe purposes of building, cabinet-work, and dying. The tree called\r\nhere _anduassu_ is nearly fifteen feet high, and two in diameter,\r\ngrows rapidly, and only in the vicinity of the sea. The Indians make\r\nan aperient medicine from its fruit, with which they cure the dropsy.\r\nOil is extracted from it for burning lights, and for the composition of\r\nblue ink, and a blue dye. The _tatagyba_, which is the _morus\r\ntinctoria_ of Linneus, affords an excellent yellow dye, extracted\r\nby the boiling of its wood in water, with the addition of a portion\r\nof alum. The _grumixameira_ is a tree which produces a most\r\nexcellent fruit, similar to a cherry in appearance, but of a finer\r\nflavour. I brought some of its seed to England, but am yet uncertain\r\nwhether it will prosper in our climate. A small tree produces a clove,\r\nsaid to be superior to that of the Moluccas. The camphor tree, the\r\ncane of Madagascar, some African grasses, and a delicate species\r\nfrom Hindostan, have been recently naturalized here. Canes of such\r\nthickness and height grow upon the margins of the Suruhy, that ladders\r\nare made of them to hang the highest temples with decorations for\r\nfestivals. In many situations ferns are met with, not differing in the\r\nleast from those of Europe, except in the immense quantities which\r\ngrow in uncultivated grounds. In the woods adjacent to Andrahi, near\r\nthe road leading to the cascades of Tejuco, there is one which has\r\ngrown, amongst other vegetation of wild trees and brushwood, to the\r\nperpendicular height of eighteen feet. In some woods, a sort of almond\r\ntree is met with, with fruit almost spherical, and of the magnitude\r\nof a hen’s egg. Cocoa trees are not very abundant, owing to an insect\r\nwhich gnaws the sprout after it grows to any size, and prevents their\r\narrival at the perfection they otherwise would. European horticulture\r\nsucceeds better here than in the northern provinces. The mango tree is\r\nonly abundant in the suburbs of the capital, and rarely fructifies to\r\nperfection. Oranges grow spontaneously, and consist of various sorts;\r\nthe selectas, which are large, and the tangerinas, both of the most\r\ndelicious qualities. The coffee tree, having been naturalized here,\r\nduring the government of Conde de Bobadella, by the attention and\r\ncare of a magistrate, multiplies prodigiously, and is now one great\r\nbranch of the riches of this province. The cotton tree does not prosper\r\nuniversally. Apple, pear, cherry, and apricot trees do not succeed. Fig\r\ntrees grow rapidly, and produce fruit in perfection; but they have an\r\nenemy in a little insect, which introduces itself very frequently into\r\nthe pith, and dries it up. Amongst an infinity of other productions may\r\nbe enumerated jalap, ipecacuanha, called here _poaya_, trees of\r\ngum, of _sangue de drago_, (blood of dragon,) of oil of capaiba,\r\nand of Peruvian balsam. The cultivation of cochineal is now little\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\nCITIES AND TOWNS.--The cities and towns in this province\r\nare remarkable for their small number and general insignificance,\r\nconsidering its extent and capabilities. The same observation is\r\napplicable to all the other provinces, and to some infinitely more so.\r\nIn this province may be reckoned two cities and twelve towns, having\r\nno good roads or regular communication with each other by land, but\r\nmere tracks and bridle-ways constituting an intricate and difficult\r\nmedium of intercourse. But we hail, with no common satisfaction, the\r\nimprovements that will necessarily succeed to the change that has taken\r\nplace in the system of government in the mother-country, and which has\r\nalready begun to operate a like change in the provinces of Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable want of roads, and all the other facilities of\r\nhusbandry, commerce, and enjoyment, is the natural consequence of the\r\nstate of penury and ignorance in which the inhabitants, generally, of\r\nthis region are involved, by a system that cannot too soon give way\r\nto the more enlightened policy which appears to be dawning upon them.\r\nThis good work, as far as it has proceeded, redounds highly to the\r\nhonour of the Portuguese people; no sanguinary event having marked\r\ntheir endeavours in the cause of freedom, thereby affording a most\r\nsatisfactory contrast to the bloody pages that blacken the revolution\r\nof many other nations. May they soon regain their former dignity of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe places we alluded to are,\r\n\r\n    CITIES.                                              DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\n    Cape Frio.                                          Cape Frio.\r\n    St. Sebastian (commonly called Rio de Janeiro)      Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\n    TOWNS.

Canta-Gallo.\r\n\r\nThe district of Ilha Grande is mountainous, wholesome, and fertile.\r\nIt is bounded on the west by the province of St. Paulo; on the north,\r\nby the continuation of the Organ Mountains, which separate it from\r\nthe district of Parahiba Nova; on the east, by the River Taguahi, the\r\nlimits of the district of Rio de Janeiro, with the exception of which,\r\nnone of the others exceed it in the prompt means which it enjoys of\r\nexporting its productions, which are farinha, or flour of the mandioca,\r\nIndian corn, rice, feijao, (black beans,) coffee, sugar, cacháça, (bad\r\nrum,) indigo, some cocoa, and timber. Very few cattle of any kind are\r\nbred; but it abounds in poultry.\r\n\r\nParati, with the title of a countship, and famous for its cacháça,\r\n(rum,) which is reputed to be the best in the state, was created a\r\ntown in 1660, and is situated in a level country, on the western side\r\nof the bay of Ilha Grande, betwixt the river Patetiba, and that from\r\nwhich it derives its name. Its streets are straight, crossing at right\r\nangles, with edifices of stone, and a parochial church of Our Lady\r\nof Remedies, the chapels of Lapa, and of Griefs. It has a _Juiz de\r\nFora_, a judicial officer, and royal professors (as they are called)\r\nof the primitive letters and Latin. Its commerce is considerable. It is\r\nsituated about sixty miles west of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nAngra dos Reys is a maritime town, in a state of mediocrity, standing\r\namong the frontier mountains of Ilha Grande, which name it frequently\r\ntakes. It is defended by two redoubts, and has a parish-church of Our\r\nLady of Conceiçao; also the chapels of Lapa, and St. Luzia; a convent\r\nof Franciscans, and one of slippered Carmelites. The extensive domains\r\nof the former have not ceased to increase. Its inhabitants enjoy a\r\nsalubrious air; and vessels of the largest size can come to anchor\r\nin the port. It has a _Juiz de Fora_, who is the same person\r\nthat fills that situation at Parati, from whence it is distant twenty\r\nmiles, and also has professors of the same kind. Its commerce is pretty\r\nconsiderable; the fig and vine trees prosper in its vicinity, and it\r\nis the most ancient town of the province. In the adjacent countries\r\nof Mambucaba, rice commonly renders one hundred for one; feijao,\r\ntwenty; Indian corn, forty and fifty; a fertility that has induced many\r\nfamilies to move to this district, which, since the year 1811, has been\r\nformed into a parish, with the church of Our Lady of Rozario, situated\r\nnear the emboucheur of the river, upon its eastern bank. A few leagues\r\nto the north, and in the vicinity of the same margin of the river, is\r\nthe picturesque mountain of Taypicu, having the form of a sugar-loaf;\r\nand at a moderate distance from the origin of the Mambucaba is the\r\ncelebrated pinnacle denominated the Friar, from its similitude to a\r\nFranciscan with the cawl upon his head.\r\n\r\nThe district of Parahiba Nova is confined on the south by that of\r\nIlha Grande; on the west, by the province of St. Paulo; on the north,\r\nby that of Minas Geraes, from which it is separated by the serra of\r\nMantiqueira. Its territory is generally mountainous, abounding with\r\nwoods and water. Its produce is rice, Indian corn, feijao, and tobacco;\r\nbut coffee and sugar are the principal riches of the district. It is\r\nalleged, that the frosts, that are consequent on the high elevation of\r\nthe country, are an obstacle to the culture of cotton and wheat, which\r\nflourish only in few situations. It has been demonstrated, that the\r\nsoil of this district is well adapted for flax; but, as the cultivation\r\nof it does not require less labour than in Europe, the apathy of the\r\ninhabitants, in a great measure induced by the causes just now glanced\r\nat, is the only obstacle to its general production. The orange,\r\npine-apple, bananas, and some other Brazilian fruits, are not abundant.\r\nCattle and horses are bred in very small numbers; pigs and poultry are\r\nplentiful. The river Parahiba traverses this district, to which it\r\ngives the name, describing innumerable windings, and collecting a great\r\nmany streams, amongst which may be noted the Barramansa, Bannanal, and\r\nBarreiros. The Pirahi is navigable for seven leagues to the church of\r\nSt. Anna, erected in 1812.\r\n\r\nRezende, created a town during the government of a count of the same\r\nname, is situated in an elevated country, upon the right bank of the\r\nriver Parahiba, which supplies it with fish, and has a parochial church\r\ncalled Our Lady of Conceiçao. Its primitive name was Campoalegre.\r\nCoffee and sugar are its exports, and it is distant about sixteen\r\nleagues north of Angra.\r\n\r\nSt. Joao Marcos, erected into a town in 1813, is upon the right bank\r\nof the small river Aráras, a western branch of the Lages, and is seven\r\nleagues north of Angra, and nineteen west of the capital. Its church is\r\ndedicated to the saint from which it takes its name. Its inhabitants\r\ncultivate a prodigious quantity of coffee, which is decidedly esteemed\r\nthe best in the Brazil; also some sugar. It is a halting place for\r\nthe bands of mules, and travellers coming from the province of St.\r\nPaulo to the metropolis; but, like all other towns and places in the\r\nBrazil, possesses no inns for the accommodation of the wayfarer, who,\r\nif not used to the modes of the country, must cater as well as he can.\r\nProceeding from hence towards St. Paulo, the mountains are of such\r\nheight, that passes, or ways, are formed only by considerable windings\r\nand intricate ascents.\r\n\r\nA little above the passage of the Parahibuna, betwixt the Parahiba and\r\nthe Preto, is the village of Valença, with a hermitage of Our Lady of\r\nGlory, (Gloria,) which serves for the devotion of the inhabitants;\r\nconsisting of four hordes of Christianized Indians, which are the\r\nPuris, who are of a small stature; the Araris, whiter and well made;\r\nthe Pittas, and Xumettos. Some unconverted natives dwell amongst them.\r\nUpon the northern bank of the Parahiba, at the passage towards the\r\nParahibuna, is the parish of Our Lady of Conceiçao, (Conception,)\r\ninhabited by white people. It is much frequented.\r\n\r\nThe district of Rio de Janeiro, situated betwixt those of Cape Frio on\r\nthe east, and Ilha Grande on the south, extends twenty leagues from\r\neast to west, and nearly in its centre is the bay of the same name,\r\nwhich receives all the rivers that fertilize this district, with the\r\nexception of the Guandu. Its productions do not materially differ from\r\nthe others, in the conveyance of which to the capital it, however,\r\nenjoys greater facility.\r\n\r\nST. SEBASTIAN, better known by the name of Rio de Janeiro,\r\nis the most important, populous, and commercial city in the Brazil.\r\nIt was created a bishopric in the year 1776, and the metropolis of\r\nthis region, in 1763; from which period, to the arrival of Queen\r\nDonna Maria and the royal family, on the 7th of March, 1808, it was\r\ngoverned by seven successive viceroys: these were, the Count da Cunha,\r\nthe Count d’ Azambuja, the Marquis de Lavrodio, Luiz de Vasconcellas\r\ne Souza, the Count de Rezende, Fernando Joze de Portugal, (now the\r\nMarquis d’Aguiar,) and Count d’ Arcos, a nobleman highly esteemed by\r\nthe people under his jurisdiction, which terminated before its natural\r\nexpiration, in consequence of the events in Portugal that drove the\r\nroyal family to their Trans-Atlantic possessions. It is affirmed that\r\nthis fidalgo undeservedly suffered some persecution at this period,\r\nin consequence of the intrigues or influence which a certain family,\r\nwho accompanied the court, had over the Prince Regent, (two of whom\r\nhave since received titles,) but which influence was counteracted\r\nin some measure by the Queen. This fidalgo was afterwards sent as\r\ncaptain-general to Bahia, where he displayed considerable ability\r\nat the time the revolution burst forth at Pernambuco, and otherwise\r\nadvanced the prosperity of the province. The termination of the\r\nPernambucan revolt was attributed to the prompt measures which he\r\nadopted. He is now minister of marine in this city. His son received\r\nthe Hon. Mr. Thornton, our minister at the Brazilian court, on his\r\nlanding at the Palace-stairs, for whom and his suite three of the royal\r\nstate carriages were in waiting. It was affirmed, that no minister had\r\never been received with greater marks of respect. This city is situated\r\nin a plain, the major part of which, in former times was washed by the\r\nsea, at the base of an accumulation of small hills and mountains of all\r\nelevations upon its southern precincts. It extends about two miles in\r\nlength, from east to west. Its northern side is enclosed by a cordon\r\nof five mountains, all oblong, and which leave space only for one\r\nstreet, betwixt their eastern base and the pria (beach.) The central\r\none of these mountains is the highest and most extensive: betwixt some\r\nof them, there are streets or roads leading to the margin of the bay.\r\nUpon the eastern and lowest elevation is situated the monastery of St.\r\nBento. The adjoining one is crowned with the fort of Conceiçao, and the\r\nepiscopal palace. On the western one, there is a chapel of St. Diogo,\r\nand upon the central one towards the beach, another of Our Lady of\r\nLivramento.\r\n\r\nIn front of the granite rock, upon which St. Bento stands, is the\r\nisland of Cobras, or Snakes, which is one hundred and sixty-five\r\nfathoms long, from east to west, and proportionably wide, not very\r\nhigh, and fortified, having within its precincts a loathsome prison,\r\ngenerally appropriated to the confinement of state prisoners, to\r\nwhich, however, Englishmen have been occasionally sent, for trifling\r\nirregularities in regard to passports and other matters of no serious\r\nimport. There are two trapiches, or warehouses, upon its margin next\r\nthe channel, which is about one hundred and fifty yards in width.\r\nAt its northern entrance, merchant vessels lie for the purpose of\r\ndischarging and taking in their cargoes, which are performed by large\r\nbarges, at no inconsiderable expense. Almost north-west from the\r\ngranite rocks of St. Diogo, at a distance of about three quarters of a\r\nmile across a point of the bay, and upon a gentle eminence, is situated\r\nthe hospital of Lazaros, which has a very commanding appearance, and\r\nwas formerly a house of recreation belonging to the Jesuits, but is\r\nnow used as a barrack for a regiment of Cassadores, from Portugal,\r\nwho perform the duty of royal guard at the palace of St. Christovao,\r\nabout a mile distant from it. Between the rocks of St. Diogo and the\r\nlazaretto, a branch of the bay forms a small creek, which separates\r\nthe Cidade Nova from the village of Matta Porcas. The bridge of St.\r\nDiogo, by which they communicate, is constructed of wood. The beach\r\nleading from St. Bento to this point, describes several windings and\r\nsweeping crescents, formed by projecting headlands, in one of which,\r\nupon the side of a gently ascending hill, the English burial-ground\r\npresents a conspicuous object. In sailing along the bay, the neat white\r\nbuilding that crowns it, the over hanging trees dispersed about, with\r\nthe already accumulating tombstones, produce a corresponding interest\r\nin a feeling mind, on passing the bones of countrymen, resting in a\r\nsituation so picturesque and sadly tranquil, far removed from their\r\nnative land. May you rest undisturbed, said I, at the sight, and may\r\nthose estimable relatives and friends who pay the departed spirits the\r\ntribute of affectionate remembrance, journey through life in peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThe houses of Rio de Janeiro are generally built of stone, one story\r\nhigh, with balconies, which formerly were barricadoed with latticed\r\ndoors and windows, but these were ordered to be removed after the\r\narrival of the royal family. The ground floors, which are not used as\r\nshops or stores, still exhibit this miserable and gloomy aspect of\r\nclosely latticed windows and doors. In the upper part of the latter,\r\nwooden latticed windows are introduced, and the whole are most commonly\r\nsuspended from the top lintel, secured with hinges. The inmates\r\npush them outwards, with their hands or heads, for the purpose of\r\nobtaining a side view of what is passing in the streets. Numbers of the\r\ninhabitants of this city are thus seen resting upon their elbows, the\r\nhead projecting the lower points of those hanging windows, frequently\r\nto the annoyance of persons passing along the very narrow footways.\r\n\r\nThe streets cross each other at right angles. The Rua Direita, running\r\nnorth and south from the base of the St. Bento Hill to the Palace\r\nSquare, is the best and widest in the city, and the principal head of\r\nothers branching off in a westerly direction, which are crossed, at\r\ncertain distances, by other streets running in a parallel line with the\r\nfirst. Amongst those leading from the Rua Direita, may be enumerated\r\nthe Rua dos Pescadores, Rua do Sabao, Rua d’Alfandigo, and the Rua\r\nd’Ouvidor; which latter is the chief outlet to three or four roads\r\nleading from the suburbs of the city, and is, in consequence, tolerably\r\nthronged with cabriolets, carriages, mules, and horsemen.\r\n\r\nThe streets being very narrow, foot passengers experience many\r\ninconveniences, and not the least from horsemen, who do not scruple to\r\nride upon the narrow foot-path, which scarcely admits of two people\r\npassing, in order to avoid the dirt and holes of the badly paved\r\nstreets. Another annoyance is the Senhors Picadores, or royal gentlemen\r\nmule breakers, the most miserable looking wretches, who assume all\r\nthe self-will peculiar to their animals, and some of that consequence\r\nwhich the servants of the royal family generally think themselves\r\nentitled to. The royal attendants are called, by the Brazilians, the\r\n_largura_, that is, the occupiers of all the road, and make no\r\nceremony in upsetting you, or running against the carriage, gig, or\r\nhorse, of any plebeian they may encounter. Next come the royal cadets,\r\nin such a helter-skelter, that it may justly be compared to the\r\nsuddenness and fury of one of the gusts of wind we experienced in our\r\npassage across the Equator. They are the signal of the approach of some\r\npart of the royal family; and, as it is the custom for every one they\r\nmeet to take off their hats, and persons in carriages and on horseback\r\nto dismount, it is not a little amusing to see the general bustle that\r\nprevails on the occasion of those ceremonial storms, some flying for\r\nfear of being ridden over, others drawing up their carriages and horses\r\nto a corner or side, and all bending the knee to the royal party. At\r\nthese times, it is lucky if a person on horseback, caught in such an\r\nencounter in a narrow street, gets off without some personal injury.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to observe, that any of the royal family going\r\nout are generally attended by a party of cavalry, mounted on small\r\nand poor horses, two of which, who are something superior to a common\r\nsoldier, called cadets, precede the carriage at full gallop, through\r\nthe streets or along the roads, the rest of the cavalry immediately\r\nfollowing it. They are succeeded by other royal cabriolets, with the\r\nfidalgos in waiting, the domestic servants proceeding without any order\r\non horseback; amongst whom, he who carries before him, at full gallop,\r\nthe royal crimson night-stool, is no inexpert horseman.\r\n\r\nSome foreigners have resisted the right which the royal cadets assume\r\nof compelling them to dismount, and it will be readily conceded,\r\nthat such a ceremony cannot but be very repugnant to the feelings\r\nof Englishmen, Americans, and others, although they have generally\r\ncomplied with it. The Queen, who has the character of being extremely\r\nparticular and peremptory on this point, a few years since, taking\r\nher usual ride to a small cottage and garden, at the bottom of the\r\nOrange Valley, met Lord Strangford, who refused to comply with the\r\naccustomed ceremony. The cadets instantly insulted his Lordship, by\r\nusing their swords in compelling him to dismount. The only redress\r\nwhich his Lordship obtained, was the imprisonment of the guards for\r\na short time. About three years ago, Mr. Sumpter, the American\r\nminister, met the Queen in the same neighbourhood. The guard rode up\r\nto him, saying, “_Apea-se Senr_.” He replied, that he was the\r\nAmerican minister, and that he should not dismount, on which they did\r\nnot hesitate to compel him. Mr. Sumpter said that he did not require\r\nany satisfaction for this gross insult, but stated with great spirit,\r\nthat he should provide himself with holsters and pistols, and would\r\nshoot the first person who offered him a similar insult. Very shortly\r\nafterwards, he met the Queen’s guard again, who rode up to him, making\r\nthe same peremptory demand as before. In answer to which, he frankly\r\ntold them, that the first man who offered him any violence, he would\r\nshoot dead upon the spot. This resolute conduct induced them to retire.\r\nUpon this, it is said, the Queen ordered them to proceed a second time\r\nto dismount Mr. Sumpter; but they were intimidated by his continued\r\nfirmness. It is generally affirmed that her Majesty was highly incensed\r\nat Mr. Sumpter’s conduct, and requested the minister of state to issue\r\nan order for his imprisonment in the island of Cobras. The minister\r\nprevailed upon her Majesty to wait the result of a despatch to the\r\nKing upon the subject, who was then forty miles off at St. Cruz, and\r\nwho gave orders immediately, that no foreigner should be compelled to\r\npay more courtesy than his own Sovereign would require from him. Since\r\nthat time, however, an English merchant, who was driving his lady in\r\na chaise, was beat by the Queen’s guards, till his arm became quite\r\nblack, and his life endangered, notwithstanding he had stopped his\r\nhorse, stood up in the chaise, and took off his hat. In the month of\r\nJuly, 1819, Commodore Bowles was taking a ride near the Orange Valley,\r\nwhen the Queen’s cadets beat him off his horse with their swords.\r\nThe cadets were sent on board the _Creole_ to apologize for\r\ntheir conduct, and the commodore advised them in future to draw their\r\nswords only against an enemy. To the King, who does not require this\r\nridiculous and inconvenient homage, the English generally are desirous\r\nof showing their respect by dismounting.\r\n\r\nOn the northern side of the city is situated an almost oblong square,\r\ncalled the Campo of St. Anna. It is more than a quarter of a mile in\r\nlength, and about half the width. A church of the same name divides it\r\ninto two parts. The western part is destined for the Cidade Nova, (or\r\nNew City,) and increasing in buildings, denoting, however, very little\r\nregard to architecture or general comfort in the edifices. Of the eight\r\nstreets which run into the Campo St. Anna, those of St. Pedro and Sabao\r\nare intended to continue under the same names the whole extent of the\r\nnew city, which is to terminate at the wooden-bridge of St. Diogo\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis city is divided into seven parishes; that of St. Sebastian, or\r\nthe royal chapel, dedicated to the use of the royal family, with a\r\ncurate chosen from the canons, that of Se, at present with a chapel and\r\nalso a canonical curate, St. Joze, St. Ritta, St. Anna, St. Francisco\r\nXavier, and Our Lady of Candellaria, the parish church of which, yet\r\nincomplete, presents a very handsome frontispiece, and is also the\r\nonly parochial church in the kingdom, where chaplains, at this time\r\nfifteen in number, officiate daily, in form of a collegiate church.\r\nThere is a house of misericordia, with a hospital for the sick, and an\r\nestablishment for the reception of orphans, the legitimate offspring\r\nof white parents, which place they leave on being married, and receive\r\na certain dowry. There are eleven chaplains for the purpose of praying\r\nat canonical hours in the choir of the church. There is a convent of\r\nBenedictines and another of Franciscans. The ci-devant convent of the\r\nslippered Carmelites now forms a part of the palace, and their church\r\nis the royal chapel. The bishop is the chaplain-mor. The chapter is\r\ncomposed at present of twenty-eight canons, of whom eight use the\r\nvestments and adopt the usages of the monsenhores of the patriarchal\r\nat Lisbon; the others received, by law, the title of Senhoria, in\r\nDecember, 1808; they dress in cloaks, and the whole wear red stockings.\r\nThere is an alms’ house of Terra-Santa, to entertain the travelling\r\nbrotherhood. The two seminaries of St. Joze and St. Joaquim are ill\r\nattended and as ill conducted. In the latter Dr. Gardner, an English\r\ngentleman, lectures on chymistry, but he has few pupils. He receives\r\na stipulated salary, and is appointed by the crown. Also a third\r\norder (Terceiras) of St. Francisco d’Assis, of Our Lady of Carmo,\r\nwith a beautiful chapel, and of St. Francisco de Paula, each with\r\nits hospital, either complete or begun, for the poor brothers. The\r\nJesuitical college is converted into a royal military hospital, with\r\nschools of surgery; and, agreeably to the tenure of the respective\r\nstatutes upon this subject, five years are required for the formation\r\nof competent surgeons. Amongst other chapels to be remarked, is that of\r\nSt. Peter, of a circular form, with an arched roof, where ten chaplains\r\nperform divine service, and none are admitted into orders, unless\r\nthey can demonstrate that they are of the brotherhood of St. Peter:\r\nSt. Cruz, which has an elegant frontispiece; there the military hold\r\ntheir religious festivals: Hospicio, with an arched roof and a cupola:\r\nand Our Lady of Gloria, situated upon an elevated point or headland,\r\nin great part surrounded with the sea, which forms a very handsome\r\nand conspicuous object when viewed from the bay. The hill upon which\r\nit stands runs along in uneven elevations as far as Pria Flemingo,\r\nwhere it terminates in an abrupt precipice of granite rock. The\r\nfront of this hill, facing the bay, nearly in a state of wild nature,\r\nwas some time ago purchased by Mr. Maiden, an English gentleman, upon\r\nthe side of which he has erected a very excellent mansion for his own\r\nresidence, as well as three or four other neat houses, all occupied by\r\nEnglish gentlemen; one at the extremity, near the granite rock, is in\r\nthe possession of the Rev. Mr. Crane. The Gloria Hill is decidedly the\r\nmost agreeable situation for a residence in the vicinity of Rio: it\r\nis elevated, and commands an interesting view of the harbour and all\r\nvessels as they enter and leave the port; at the same time enjoying all\r\nthe advantages of the land and sea breezes. Its only inconvenience is\r\nthe approach to it, by a steep ascent on the side of the Gloria Chapel.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CONVENT OF ST ANTONIO, RIO JANEIRO]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CONVENT OF ST THERESA, PART OF THE AQUEDUCT, & A\r\n  SEGE OR CABRIOLET.]\r\n\r\nThere are two female convents at Rio de Janeiro. The in-dwellers of one\r\nadhere rigidly to their system of strict seclusion from all intercourse\r\nwith the world: they are Therezian nuns, and the convent is agreeably\r\nsituated upon an eminence, near the double row of arches in which the\r\naqueduct terminates. The others are Franciscan nuns, and an apartment\r\nin their convent of Ajuda is appropriated for the admission of their\r\nfriends, to converse with them through an iron grating. This convent\r\npossesses an antiquated organ, coeval with the establishment, and the\r\nhand of man had not been allowed, for many a year, to harmonize the\r\ndiscordancy occasioned by the deteriorating lapse of time. An English\r\nprofessor of music was engaged, under considerable penalties to keep\r\nthe peace, and presented with a _carte-blanche_ to visit the convent,\r\nfor the purpose of thoroughly renovating this instrument, which, on\r\naccomplishing, he declared was as fine a toned organ as he had ever\r\nheard. I was permitted to accompany this gentleman, upon one occasion,\r\nunder the garb of a servant. We approached a door in the corner of a\r\nsmall inner square, which the outer entrance leads to. A respectful\r\nknock produced the opening of a small shutter within the door, when\r\nthe fine face and black eyes of the watchful porteress were presented\r\nat the iron grating. After a parley of a few minutes, during which, at\r\nintervals, she examined me with rather a scrutinizing eye, the bolts\r\nwere withdrawn, and, on entering, we found ourselves at the foot of\r\na flight of spacious stairs, which she ascended with us. At the top\r\nwe were joined by two other nuns, apparently about the age of forty,\r\nwho conducted us along a passage or avenue; one of them continuing to\r\nsound a bell the whole way, with a view of announcing to the sisterhood\r\nthat man was within the precincts of the building, whose sight they\r\nwere thus cautioned to avoid. Our three companions were extremely\r\naffable, and conversed with much animation. We arrived, after passing\r\nthrough a considerable part of the building, at the apartment where the\r\norgan stood, which was also a place of devotion, and ornamented with\r\nthe figures of various saints. Creolean slaves soon came, to assist\r\nin the operations upon the organ, in which I was an equally awkward\r\nperformer. Those slaves, unnaturally destined also to be here immured\r\nfor life, were young and some of them very handsome. At intervals many\r\nother nuns came to the door and looked in by stealth. Some gradually\r\novercame their shyness, entered the room, offered up their devotions,\r\nrepeated their “Avi Marias,” and, by degrees, approached the organ,\r\nwith which our attention _appeared_ to be absorbed. Nature so triumphed\r\nover superstitious habits that many of them became very familiar and\r\nlively. One of them sung part of an English song, which my companion\r\nhad translated into Portuguese, he playing upon the organ as an\r\naccompaniment; the others appeared quite delighted, and shouted out\r\n“_Viva, viva_.” Upon some of them perseveringly urging me for an air,\r\nI gave them a verse of “God save the King,” which, on others coming\r\ninto the room, I was obliged to repeat. The governesses joined in these\r\noccasional bursts of vivacity, and at other times took their stations\r\nin different parts of the room, apparently in the posture of devotion,\r\nand so situated that they could observe all that was passing. Upon all\r\noccasions of their coming in or leaving the room they bent the knee to\r\nthe figure of Jesus. One of them directed my attention to the beautiful\r\nquality of the silk which constituted the vestments on the figure of\r\nSt. John, and observed, several times, that he appeared _muito triste_\r\n(very sad) that morning. I did not think proper to dissent from this\r\nromantic discovery; but I was a little astonished to find that she\r\ncarried her superstition so far as to imagine that an inanimate figure\r\ncould actually change its aspect, and, consequently, that it was\r\nendowed with vital feeling and thought. She next showed me a _menino\r\nJesu_, (child Jesus,) richly dressed, with a silken band around the\r\nwaist, from which was suspended an embroidered bag, containing, she\r\nsaid, a piece of the real bone of our Saviour. I ventured here not\r\nwholly to conceal my doubts; but she assured me it was so, and that\r\nthe Queen, whose remains were deposited in the garden of the convent,\r\nbrought it from Lisbon, and presented it to them: this was conclusive.\r\nNo doubt they regarded us as pitiable heretics, one of them taking\r\ngreat pains to teach me _Padre Nosso_, _Avi Maria_, _Santa Maria_,\r\nall which I was instructed to write in my book, and then compelled to\r\nrepeat several times to the rest, who seemed very much pleased at my\r\npromising symptoms of Catholicism. A very fine girl, about ten years\r\nof age, had just entered the convent. I expressed my surprise and\r\nregret, to one of the governesses, that so young a child should be shut\r\nup here for life; she replied, that it was infinitely better than being\r\nexposed to the wickedness of the world. They are involved in great\r\nignorance, but apparently not only comfortable, but happy, and great\r\ncleanliness pervaded that part of the convent that we saw. We returned\r\nby the same avenues; and the bell, which had been intrusted to my novel\r\nmanagement, sending forth rather unusual sounds, induced some of the\r\nmore secluded sisterhood to peep, with some surprise, out of their\r\ncells; and, as I was found not to be intuitively a bellman to their\r\nwishes, I was as quickly deprived of my new situation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Jas. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  THE CONVENT OF AJUDA.]\r\n\r\nAn aqueduct, for furnishing water to the Cidade Nova, is nearly\r\ncompleted; in which quarter some new fountains are to be observed,\r\nespecially the Lagarto, and another in the Campo St. Anna, large, built\r\nof stone, and discharging the water by numerous spouts.\r\n\r\nThe fountains in the eastern district of the city consist of one in the\r\nPalace Square, in the shape of a tower, the _Marrecas_; one in the\r\nMoura Place; and the _Carioca_, with twelve spouts; all of which\r\nare supplied by the aqueduct already mentioned.\r\n\r\nA visit to its source I found to be a most interesting excursion. I\r\nwas accompanied to it by two friends. We directed our course to the\r\nvillage of Matta Cavallos, passing underneath the double arcade, the\r\nsuperior one having forty-two arches, and which conducts the water\r\nfrom the Therezian hill across a valley close to the city. We called\r\nupon Mr. Langsdorffe, the Russian consul, and proceeded from his house\r\nup a gradual ascent, covered with almost impervious woods, and, after\r\ncrossing a deep glen, gained the terrace, which is formed by excavation\r\nalong the sides of mountains and precipices for nearly four miles. As\r\nfar as two white pillars, opening into the Orange Valley, a distance\r\nof about three miles, the terrace has been recently repaired, and\r\nforms of itself a very fine promenade. Upon its inner side the range\r\nof aqueduct is erected, which is nearly eight feet high, consisting\r\nof two walls, a yard from each other, which space is arched over, and\r\nencloses the small stream of water that flows rapidly along a channel\r\nhewn out of stone. As far as the pillars it has been recently enlivened\r\nby white-washing, and at certain distances small apertures are left,\r\nfor the purpose of ventilation. In some places, small iron gates are\r\nintroduced into the wall, to admit of the occasional entrance of\r\npersons within it; those gates are locked, and an opening is left at\r\nthe bottom large enough to receive the arm. There is likewise a bason,\r\ncut out of the stone, to supply the passers-by with water, which has\r\nrather a peculiar flavour.\r\n\r\nThe eye is delighted with the succession of beautiful scenery which\r\nthe walk presents, and rambles in undiminished rapture at every point,\r\nover the varied and romantic objects which sportive nature has here\r\nproduced. Precipices above, and accumulated alpines shut in the view to\r\nthe south and west. Winding glens below, formed by smaller elevations;\r\nhere and there houses seen almost embosomed in the woody ravines; the\r\nvalley of Engenho Velho, sprinkled with white houses, which is also\r\nthe site of the palace of St. Christovao; the city and bay, surrounded\r\nwith their amphitheatres of mountains; the high soaring masses near the\r\npass to the Tejuca; the towering piles of the Organ range, and others\r\nof varied appearance to the right, edging the distant horizon, together\r\nform a grand totality, a most animated and animating picture, extending\r\nfar to the north and east, harmonizing the feelings, and lifting the\r\nmind into a profound and pleasing train of wonder and adoration of the\r\nall-powerful being who has ordained these noble diversities of nature,\r\nover which his creative hand has thrown the graceful and cheerful\r\ncovering of verdant trees and shrubs, swarming in wild profusion, the\r\nhand of man having in few places contributed its aid.\r\n\r\n    “Hail, Source of beings! Universal Soul\r\n    Of Heav’n and Earth! Essential Presence, hail!\r\n    To Thee I bend the knee: to Thee my thoughts\r\n    Continual climb, who with a master hand\r\n    Hast the great whole into perfection touch’d.”\r\n\r\nThis charming picture is lost to view on passing the opening betwixt\r\nthe pillars, where the prospect, although more confined, is admirable,\r\nconsisting of the deep recesses of the Orange Valley, the more lofty\r\nfeatures of the mountains which encompass it, and the singularly formed\r\nCorcovada at its head, all rising into indescribable magnificence.\r\nThese are scenes that would have delighted and invigorated with new\r\nenergy the most exalted poets and painters. From hence, a narrower\r\nterrace, covered with entwining brushwood, and skirting along the\r\nside of the mountains for about a mile, brought us to the head of the\r\nvalley, where the origin of the aqueduct is marked, by an inscription,\r\nto have taken place in the year 1744. Its source is adorned with a\r\nfine cascade, at the foot of which, a declining platform of rocks,\r\novershadowed with trees, and refreshed with the falling water, afforded\r\nus a delightful retreat from the rays of the sun; and here in reality\r\nwe enjoyed the refreshment a slave had brought for us: above us the\r\nrugged mountains in precipices and the stony bed of the rivulet were\r\nseen, overhung with high trees and shrubs as far as the eye\r\ncould reach. In this place, and from these waters, a poetical mind\r\nmust, indeed, imbibe those draughts of inspiration which the vale of\r\nTempe, and the mountain and stream of Parnassus are fabled to have\r\nproduced. A long and intricate path leads from hence to the summit\r\nof the Corcovada Mountain; below us there was an abrupt and rocky\r\nsteep, its sides covered with thickly growing brushwood, down which\r\nthe water descended in a murmuring course to the valley; the whole of\r\nits varieties of verdure and fertility, with the bay of Bota-fogo at\r\nits lower extremity, was within our view. A winding road led us to a\r\npoint, where we descended by a difficult way into the valley, while its\r\nfine oranges, growing spontaneously, supplied us with a dessert. It is\r\nbeautified with some elegant houses, of one of which, at the bottom,\r\nalmost opposite to the Queen’s cottage, the accompanying sketch is a\r\nspecimen. Our way from hence continued by the Cateta and the Gloria to\r\nRio.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PILLARS NEAR THE SOURCE OF THE AQUEDUCT]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C.

Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  HOUSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ORANGE VALLEY.]\r\n\r\nThe open spaces of the city, denominated squares, consist of the\r\nPalace Square, one hundred and fifty yards long, and eighty wide,\r\nwith two good landing stairs from the bay; of the Roceo, one hundred\r\nand eighty yards long, and one hundred wide; and the Capim, recently\r\ncalled Peloirinho. In the Cidado Nova, there is one which occupies\r\nthe intermediate space of the crossing of four streets; but, although\r\nthese are open spaces, they have little regularity or semblance to any\r\nthing that produces the idea of a square. The Royal Palace which has\r\nmore the appearance of a manufactory than the residence of a king, is\r\ncomposed of that formerly occupied by the viceroys, the convent of\r\nthe Carmelites, and the senate-house, united by passages, the first\r\nforming the southern side of the square, and the latter the western.\r\nThe northern side consists of a row of houses, which are private\r\nproperty, with two stories the same as the others. The first portion\r\nhas twenty-four windows on the side, and nine in front towards the\r\nbay, the lower part of which is occupied by the guards and some public\r\noffices, the rooms above are generally used by the King for public\r\nlevees. Some of the merchants and groups of the male inhabitants\r\nfrequent every evening that part of the square, and the walls adjoining\r\nthe landing places and bordering the bay afford convenient seats, which\r\nare fully occupied. Here the arrival of vessels is ascertained, and the\r\nsea-breeze enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe mint, the armory, the naval arsenal, and that of the military,\r\n(called _trem_,) and the custom house, are the principal public\r\nbuildings; but of themselves present nothing particularly worthy\r\nof remark. There are various public trapiches, or warehouses for\r\nthe deposit of produce. The public gardens, which are stated by\r\nsome travellers to have been fully and gaily attended some twelve\r\nor fourteen years ago, are now quite unfrequented, and sunk into\r\nneglect. This place of resort in former times consists of about two\r\nacres of ground, bordering upon the bay, enclosed with a high wall,\r\nand neatly laid out in walks of trees, overhung with a variety of\r\nevergreen foliage. There is a stone terrace at the end, ascended by\r\ntwo flights of steps, commanding a view of the bay, with the remains\r\nof two pavilions, and other mutilated objects. This place is not left\r\nwithout regret, that so cool and agreeable a situation, and so well\r\ncalculated for a public promenade, is permitted to fall into decay.\r\nFor the administration of justice the same tribunals exist here as at\r\nLisbon. At the period of the suppression of the board of inspection,\r\nin 1808, was created the tribunal of the royal junta of commerce,\r\nagriculture, manufactures, and navigation, composed of ten deputies,\r\na president, a secretary, and an official maior, (officiating mayor.)\r\nThe Jesuitical library is open to the public; it contains about sixty\r\nthousand volumes, amongst which there are but few modern works, and a\r\ngreat many old ones on theology. I was in the habit of frequenting it,\r\nand as is the custom at the national library in Paris, the librarian\r\nattends, immediately brings any book that may be required, and places\r\nit upon a small reading desk on the table, with which each person is\r\naccommodated. The very small number who attended consisted generally\r\nof priests and friars. Manufactories have yet acquired no footing in\r\nthis city; there is however, one of sail-cloth, and another of silk\r\nstockings; also, a few miles distant, at Andrahi, there are works for\r\nprinting cottons upon a small scale, and conducted by a person who has\r\nbeen in England. Coarse cottons are manufactured in the interior of\r\nBrazil, and they pass the shuttle with the hand, according to the mode\r\nused in England formerly.\r\n\r\nThe only place of amusement in Rio is the theatre, erected within\r\nthe last few years, and which, in point of external appearance, is\r\nbeyond mediocrity. It contains four tiers of boxes on each side of the\r\nhouse, thirteen in each tier, making, in the whole, one hundred and\r\nfour boxes, which are extremely gloomy, being shut in at the sides.\r\nThe royal box occupies the whole of the space fronting the stage,\r\nabove which there is a small gallery; and the pit contains about four\r\nhundred persons. The orchestra is esteemed very tolerable; but the\r\nperformances are indifferent. Two French dancers and their wives are at\r\npresent the magnets of attraction; and there is great emulation between\r\nthem for the palm of superiority. The Campo St. Anna contains a large\r\nbuilding, erected for the purpose of bull-baiting; but the Brazilian\r\nbull not possessing the fire and fury of this animal in Europe, was the\r\nreason of its falling into disuse, and creditable would it be if so\r\nirrational and cruel an amusement was discontinued. Within the last two\r\nyears, this building was the scene of the various feats in horsemanship\r\nof Mr. Southby and his troop, for which it is well adapted. The clown,\r\nsoon acquiring some of the local peculiarities of the people, produced\r\namongst them a fund of merriment they had been little accustomed to;\r\nand they expressed themselves more highly astonished and pleased\r\nwith those performances, and the wonderful display of agility by\r\nMrs. Southby on the tight rope, than any thing they had ever before\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro was taken by the French, in the year 1711,\r\nunder M. Duguay Truin, and afterwards recovered by the people. In the\r\npreceding year, M. du Clerc had entered the town, conducted by two\r\nfugitive negroes, from Ilha Grande.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal roads leading from this city, none of which\r\nare adapted to the use of a carriage for more than six or seven miles.\r\nThe first, leading to the southward, after passing the public gardens\r\nand the Lapa, proceeds, for a short distance, along the banks of the\r\nbay, commanding a view of its entrance, which is soon interrupted by\r\nthe Gloria Hill, behind which the road passes, and continues in a\r\nparallel line with the Pria Flemingo, which is adorned with several\r\nneat houses, many of them occupied by English merchants. The Hon. Mr.\r\nThornton had taken up a temporary residence in one of them. After\r\ncrossing a small bridge at the Cateta, the road conducts, for about a\r\nmile and a half, betwixt luxuriant and verdant hedges, to the beach\r\nor Pria of Bota-fogo, which is a fine bay, shut in by picturesque\r\npromontories and headlands, leaving only a narrow channel for the\r\ningress and egress of its waters. This beach is edged with some of the\r\nneatest and most elegant houses in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro,\r\nmany of them occupied by fidalgos, and others by English merchants;\r\none of which, in the possession of Mr. Harrison, exhibits all the\r\nbeauty, elegance, and comfort of an English villa. Bye-roads lead from\r\nhence to the Pria Vermelha, to the royal powder manufactory, and the\r\nbotanical garden already mentioned. In many parts the Cateta road is\r\nin a very bad state of repair, and the holes and hollow places form\r\npools of water after the least fall of rain. The other two roads lead\r\nto the north of the city, both branching from the Campo St. Anna, and\r\nagain communicate in passing Matta Porcas. The first and principal one\r\nproceeds from the right of the Campo, and continues for about a mile\r\nand a half, to the wooden bridge of St. Diogo, across a marshy flat,\r\nwhich eight or ten years ago was impassable, and is now denominated the\r\nCidade Nova, of which it may in time constitute a portion. The road\r\nof the Cidade Nova, being the daily route of the royal family, is kept\r\nin pretty good order, as well as the whole road as far as the palace\r\nof Christovao, which at Matta Porcas turns to the right, and continues\r\nfor about two miles along a level, with amphitheatres of various and\r\npicturesque mountains in every direction. After crossing the third\r\nbrook, by a small bridge, the way to the palace turns to the left,\r\nwhen a handsome entrance is discovered, not in unison with the palace,\r\nbut consisting of a wall and iron palisades, extending about thirty\r\nyards on each side of it, without any contiguous lodge or building.\r\nFrom hence the road sweeps to the left, up a gentle acclivity, to\r\nthe eminence upon which the palace stands, fronted by a square, not\r\nembellished with shrubs and grass-plots, but of deep sand, which is\r\nentered by the left corner, and not by the grand entrance, composed of\r\nthe elegant gates, a counterpart of those at Sion House, and sent as a\r\npresent to his Majesty by the Duke of Northumberland. They are placed\r\nin the centre betwixt pillars of granite, peculiar to the country,\r\nand two lodges, the remainder on each side along the whole front of\r\nthe palace being completed with palisades of Portuguese workmanship.\r\nIt will excite some surprise in the reader to be informed, that the\r\nouter part, which should form a road to this entrance, is allowed to\r\nremain in its natural state of hollow and uneven ground, when no very\r\ngreat labour would be required to render it complete. At present, the\r\ngates are in disuse, the lodges closed, and, with the aid of the dirt\r\nand gunpowder arising from the fire-works ranged along their front,\r\non occasions of religious festivals, the whole already appears in a\r\ncourse of dilapidation. The palace is one story high, perfectly plain,\r\nwithout any pretensions to elegance, or the semblance of any order of\r\narchitecture, and can boast of nothing but the beauty of its situation.\r\nIt might, indeed, be mistaken, at a distance, for a manufactory, in\r\nconsequence of the windows being so crowded together, and particularly\r\nat night, when it is lighted up.\r\n\r\nThe road, from the point which leads to the palace, continues by\r\neither turning a little further on to the left, and ascending a hill,\r\nor by the Campo St. Christovao, which sweeps round the hill and meets\r\nthe other road on the opposite side, and afterwards leads on to the\r\nprovince of St. Paulo and Minas Geraes. It is the grand track of\r\nthe miners and others coming from distant districts, and presents\r\nsuccessive troops of mules, laden with different produce, attached to\r\ntheir curious and rudely constructed pack-saddles, by straps of raw\r\nhides.\r\n\r\nThe road of St. Christovao and the Cidade Nova, are generally crowded\r\nby these caravans, their drivers of all complexions, dressed in cotton\r\nshirts and trowsers, with slouching hats, and combined with the horses\r\nand mules, carrying persons of rather a superior order coming also from\r\nthe interior, amount to the aggregate number of at least two thousand\r\npassing and re-passing daily. It would be difficult to describe the\r\nvariety of costume and rude appearance of the latter persons, many of\r\nwhom are dressed in black or dirty white hats, with prodigious rims,\r\na capote, or cloak, frequently of sky-blue, thrown round the front\r\npart of the body, and being crossed behind them, hangs in folds on\r\neach side of the mule. The bits of their bridles, their saddles, and\r\nstirrups, are of various antiquated and fantastic shapes. Some wear\r\nboots of brown leather, closely fitted to the leg, bound round the top\r\nwith a strap and large buckle; others with capotes, large hats, &c.\r\nwear neither shoes nor boots, but introduce the great toes only into\r\nthe stirrups, and with large heavy spurs upon the naked heels, are not\r\nthe least remarkable among these burlesque figures. I have frequently\r\nridden with them, and always found that they were communicative and\r\ncivil. Their mules, which had performed journeys of two and three\r\nmonths, did not appear to have sustained much injury. These people\r\nmostly frequent certain streets in the city for disposal of their\r\nproduce, and the purchase of manufactured goods. The Rua de Candelaria\r\nis the great mart for cheeses, brought from the interior. The Rua de\r\nViolas, Rua de St. Pedro, &c. are visited by the miners; and some of\r\nthe shopkeepers, of whom they buy their return cargo, occasionally\r\npurchase from the English merchants three or four thousand pounds of\r\ngoods in one bargain.\r\n\r\nThe other road leading from the Campo St. Anna, does not present so\r\nmuch traffic as the last, and is denominated the old road. It proceeds\r\nthrough the village of Catimby, and from thence to Matta Porcas, one\r\nend of which it passes, and advances through the valley, having many\r\ngood houses by its sides, to Andrahi, contracting afterwards betwixt\r\nthe mountains into a narrow bridle way, leading to the district of\r\nTejuco. From this road, near the Pedro Mountain, a cross road, with\r\nsome good houses, the principal one recently occupied by Mr. Gill,\r\nan English merchant, conducts through the extremity of the valley of\r\nEngenho Velho, and at a distance of about half a mile unites itself\r\nwith a road coming through another portion of the same valley, from the\r\nstone bridge near the turn to the palace. After this junction, the road\r\nproceeds through the valley of Engenho Novo, and communicates with the\r\ngreat road to the mines.\r\n\r\nThe road which turns off at the stone bridge last mentioned is a lane\r\nmuch frequented by the royal family, and is bounded by beautifully\r\nverdant hedges, and some neat shacaras, and is not dissimilar in\r\nappearance to the green lanes, leading from London to Southgate. It\r\nis the limit of the King’s shacara on the right. About three quarters\r\nof a mile from its commencement is situated the Casa de Don Pedro,\r\nrecently erected in the form of a castle, with a flag-staff at the top,\r\nthe ground-floor consisting of one good sized room, and four smaller,\r\ncovered with India matting, and furnished with chairs and sofas, but by\r\nno means in a royal style. From the palace to this casa is a favourite\r\nwalk of the King’s; the interval forms the royal shacara, and is\r\nlaid out in walks, crossing each other at right angles, shaded by an\r\nabundant variety of trees, which have been planted only within the last\r\nfew years, and demonstrate by their state of maturity, the exuberant\r\nfertility of the soil and climate.\r\n\r\nThe road continues from hence, across a brook, by a wooden bridge,\r\nwhich bounds the King’s shacara on that side; and very near to it is\r\nthe royal mill, which is yet far from being completed, although it was\r\nbegun five or six years ago. It is intended to have one water-wheel and\r\nfour pair of mill-stones. The model of the building and the machinery\r\nwere sent from Lisbon. When the mill is finished, it is expected to\r\ngrind forty sacks of wheat during the day and night, for which the\r\npublic will be charged two crusades (about five shillings) per sack, of\r\nthree alqueiras, or about three and a half of Winchester bushels.\r\n\r\nOne hundred yards further is situated Bella-fonta, the fine shacara of\r\nMr. Wright, under whose roof I received every kindness and hospitality\r\npossible, during my residence at Rio; and am happy in this opportunity\r\nof acknowledging, in common with all who know him, the high estimation\r\nI entertain of his character.\r\n\r\nWithin the circuit of the roads described, the valley of Engenho\r\nVelho is adorned with numerous neat shacaras, abounding with walks\r\nformed of oranges, and all the fruit trees of the tropics. Many give\r\nthe preference to a residence on the Cateta side; but, in consequence\r\nof the royal family frequenting this quarter, I think the spirit of\r\nimprovement shows itself more decidedly in this direction, and although\r\nthe sea breezes do not reach it, the land breezes from the adjacent\r\nmountains, sweeping along the valley, render the mornings and evenings\r\nparticularly delightful. The dews are here profuse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by G. Hurley; the figures by Shoosmith from a Sketch by\r\n    Ja^s.

Shoosmith from a Sketch by Jas. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  PALACE OF ST CRISTOVÃO.]\r\n\r\nI accompanied a gentleman, in the month of September, to see the\r\nCasa de Don Pedro, from whence we proceeded along the delightfully\r\nshaded walks of the shacara to the palace, which is in the progress of\r\naugmentation by some buildings under the inspection of Mr. Johnson, who\r\ncame to the Brazil with the gates from the Duke of Northumberland,\r\nand who has been since employed by the King in superintending the\r\nprogressive enlargement of the palace. On this day, all bands were\r\nfully employed in finishing a suite of rooms which his Majesty had a\r\ngreat wish to occupy that evening.\r\n\r\nOn descending a hill from the palace, we perceived Prince Don Miguel\r\nin a field below, dressed in a pair of great jack-boots, a cocked hat,\r\nand a star upon his breast, with a pole about 10 feet long in his hand,\r\nattending a plough with one handle, drawn by six bullocks, followed by\r\nfive or six negro drivers and a _feitor_.[12] They executed their\r\nwork very imperfectly, allowing the greatest portion of the turf to\r\nfall down again. From the superfluity of animal power employed in this\r\ndefective specimen of agriculture, our attention was directed to the\r\nroyal stables, which contained about three hundred mules and horses of\r\na diminutive size, with double the number of persons to look after them\r\nthat would have been deemed necessary in England.\r\n\r\nPrince Don Pedro had been breaking horses into harness all that\r\nmorning, and we met him with the fourth pair; he used a large unwieldy\r\nwhip, which, however, he administered pretty freely, making as much\r\nnoise as a French postilion would, on announcing his arrival at a\r\ntown, by the cracking of his whip. On passing him we stood still and\r\ntook off our hats, which was only returned by an ungracious look. We\r\nalso met Prince Don Miguel, returning from his agricultural amusement,\r\naccompanied by his _feitor_. He is a spare and pale-looking\r\nperson, about sixteen years of age. Passing close to his elbow, we paid\r\nhim the most respectful obeisance, but we were not honoured even with\r\nthe least inclination of his head.\r\n\r\nI walked one evening to see the fire-works, which had been preparing\r\nfor some time for the celebration of a saint’s day, in front of the\r\npalace, ranged along, and a few yards distant from the gates and\r\npalisades. The veranda was filled with a great many priests and friars,\r\nand others about the person of the King. His Majesty and the rest of\r\nthe family took their station at the fifth window, on the right of the\r\nhandsome flight of stairs erected by Mr. Johnson. The fire-works were\r\nill executed, and could not be put in comparison with such exhibitions\r\nin Europe, which is much to be wondered at, considering the immense\r\nrevenue here annually expended in this way, and the great number of\r\npersons that live by it and follow no other pursuit. Every evening at\r\neight o’clock, excepting holidays and Sundays, the King receives the\r\npublic, in a room appropriated for the purpose, at St. Christovao, to\r\nthe honour of _beija-māo_;[13] and the roads of Cidade Nova,\r\nCatimby, and Matta Porcas are covered, on those occasions, with\r\nofficers, and numerous persons in cabriolets, on horseback, and on\r\nfoot, pressing towards the palace, consisting of those who have some\r\nobject to carry with his Majesty. When the door is opened there is a\r\npromiscuous rushing forward, and a mulatto will be seen treading upon\r\nthe heels of a general. They advance in single rank up one side of the\r\nroom to the upper part, where his Majesty is seated, attended by his\r\nfidalgos in waiting, and, passing him in review, they countermarch in\r\nthe same order. It is said that the King has an extraordinary memory,\r\nand recollects each individual as he passes, and the object of his\r\nvisit; those who please speak to him, but a great proportion do not.\r\nIt would appear that his Majesty is partial to seeing people in this\r\nway for a considerable period before he concedes what they want. A\r\ngentleman from Lisbon informed me that he had come to Rio expressly to\r\ngain some object with the government, and he anticipated a residence\r\nof twelve months there before he accomplished it. He purposed omitting\r\nnone of those numerous attendances of _beija-māo_, unless his\r\nneglecting to do so might be observed by his Majesty; who, he observed\r\nwas particularly desirous of detaining all Europeans there as long as\r\npossible. Senhor Thomas Antonio de Portugal, the minister of state,\r\nwho has a shacara upon the left side of the road, already described,\r\nleading to Andrahi, holds a sort of public levee two days in each\r\nweek, where crowds of officers and others attend, to submit their\r\napplications or to solicit his patronage, afterwards proceeding to\r\nperform the accustomed ceremony of _beija-māo_ at the palace,\r\nduring which period, from eight to nine o’clock, a band of music, in no\r\nvery harmonious strains, is heard through a portion of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe fidalgos, and those who may be denominated the higher orders of\r\nsociety here, are infinitely behind corresponding classes in the\r\nleading states of Europe, both in the knowledge and practice of\r\ncivilized life. The pleasures and refinements of social intercourse are\r\nalike unknown to them: jealous of foreigners, their conduct towards\r\nthem is not marked by that attention or hospitality so conspicuous in\r\nother countries, where the cultivation of a liberal system of society\r\nprevails. Their main occupation consists in outward show, in the\r\npunctilious observance of court-etiquette, and a regular attendance\r\nupon the superstitious rites and festivals of the Catholic religion.\r\nWhatever little exists of pomp and splendour in this city is to be\r\ndiscovered in the temples, which are fitted up with rich profusion,\r\nmore especially the parish churches, their altars and shrines\r\nexhibiting decorations of the most costly kind, in which respect St.\r\nSebastian, or the Royal Chapel, stands pre-eminent; its richly-gilded\r\nwalls, carved work, and splendidly-ornamented altars, glittering with a\r\nprofusion of gold, silver, and precious stones, surpass in brilliancy\r\nany thing that could be imagined, by a plain Christian, as essential\r\nto the purposes of divine worship. The chapel has some paintings, and\r\none large piece over the chief altar, into which the late Queen and\r\nthe principal part of the royal family are introduced. The King has a\r\nlarge box, not unlike an opera-box, above the place where grand mass\r\nis performed; here his Majesty and the rest of the family take their\r\nseats on festival-days; the bishop, in white or yellow satin, richly\r\nembroidered with gold, his mitre of the same, sits in great state\r\nbelow, opposite to the King, when he is not engaged in any part of the\r\nceremony, in which he is assisted by a prodigious number of padres, and\r\nthe service is performed with vast magnificence. The organ, accompanied\r\nby a crowd of vocal performers, amongst whom are five or six eunuchs,\r\ngratify, with some of the finest music of the Brazil, the audience,\r\nconsisting, on some occasions, of many fidalgos, judges, ministers, and\r\nvarious individuals, who, in their gaudy robes, sit upon benches along\r\nthe body of the chapel. There are others also who are led there by\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nHere the King will sometimes spend the whole day, and, upon the\r\ncelebration of some favourite saint’s day, will remain till midnight.\r\nThese holidays and festivities are usually attended by an immense\r\nconsumption of gunpowder, in rockets, fire-works, &c. The days of some\r\nsaints are remarkable for the right every man, bearing the same name,\r\nassumes of lighting up a great bonfire in front of his house; and I\r\nremember accompanying a friend in his chaise, on the evening of St.\r\nJohn’s day, when we had some difficulty in getting the horse through\r\nthe flames and sky-rockets that illuminated and occupied the whole\r\nstreet fronting the dwellings of all the Senhor Joaos. The horses\r\ngenerally, however, do not regard it, being so accustomed to fire and\r\ngunpowder. During my stay at Rio, a bell was christened, and placed on\r\nthe south side of the royal chapel with much ceremony. The King was\r\ngodfather and the widow Princess godmother. The bell was named John the\r\nSixth, in honour of his Majesty, who sprinkled it with salt and water,\r\nand at the period that it was hoisted to its ultimate position, the\r\ntown resounded with fire-works and sky-rockets.\r\n\r\nReligious exhibitions and feasts succeed each other with very little\r\nintermission; and the Brazilian calendars present an innumerable list\r\nof them. At Whitsuntide, three or four days are dedicated to the\r\nconsecration of oxen, fowls, &c. and their consumption. The churches\r\nretail these articles at high prices, producing a considerable revenue.\r\nIn some of the parishes, at this time, the inhabitants, by turns,\r\nare at the expense of a public feast, and it occasionally costs some\r\nindividuals seven or eight hundred pounds. A boy, the son of the person\r\ngiving this entertainment, sits upon a throne, attended by boys and\r\ngirls of his own age; he is called the emperor, and, with a sceptre\r\nin his hand, presides over the feast. I saw two exhibitions of this\r\nsort on the 1st of June, one in the Campo St. Anna, and the other at\r\nthe Lappa, accompanied with fire-works. They are extremely ludicrous.\r\nThe festival of Corpus Christi, on the 10th of June, is one of their\r\ngrandest processional displays. It is only upon these occasions that\r\nthe ladies appear in public. Early in the day cabriolets, drawn by\r\nmules, are seen driving in every direction towards the Ruas Direita\r\nand d’Aquitanda, containing females in their gala dresses, while the\r\nmilitary of every description are assembled in the streets to assist\r\nin the procession, which consists principally of priests and friars,\r\nwhose prodigious numbers are calculated to swell out a cavalcade,\r\ntogether with numerous inhabitants of different parishes, wearing\r\ncloaks peculiar to the churches, which are various and showy. The whole\r\nform two lines, preceded with banners, each person, including the\r\npriests, carrying a preposterous-looking wax candle, about six feet\r\nhigh, one end of which is placed, at every step, upon the ground. The\r\nroyal horses, sumptuously caparisoned, and decorated with ribands from\r\ntheir noses to the end of their long tails, are led by grooms dressed\r\nin the most tawdry style, the royal servants of every order following;\r\nthen the judges, and all classes of people employed by the government.\r\nThe fidalgos and ministers precede and follow the bishop, who carries\r\nthe Host, under a superb canopy, attended by Princes Don Pedro and\r\nDon Miguel, the supporters of his train! The King usually follows the\r\nbishop as a train-bearer, but on this occasion he did not. The dresses\r\nof all were rich and costly; and the procession, amounting to some\r\nthousand persons, proceeded along the Rua Direita and returned, by the\r\nRua d’Aquitanda, to the palace chapel; after which there was a grand\r\ndisplay of fire-works. All the balconies were crowded with females,\r\nadorned with precious stones. The fronts of the houses were hung with\r\nsilks and crimson velvet, gilded with ornaments; and the streets were\r\nstrewed with green leaves. The general effect of the whole was very\r\nimposing.\r\n\r\nThere is rather a celebrated annual procession, on the 10th of October,\r\nin the Rua dos Ourives, having its foundation in some religious\r\nobservance peculiar to the church of that street. All the houses\r\nare hung outside with tapestry and other stuffs, and ornamented\r\nwith looking-glasses, and a great portion of the furniture which the\r\nhouse contains, not of the most elegant sort, and generally not over\r\nabundant. A procession of padres, and numerous others belonging to the\r\nparish, takes place during the evening, drawing together an immense\r\nconcourse of people, while the females, who spend the last penny to\r\nprocure a gay dress for these occasions, appear at the balconies\r\nin a profusion of finery. The houses are illuminated, not with any\r\ntransparent or appropriate devices, but with wax and common tallow\r\ncandles; some placed in the front of looking-glasses, in order to\r\nproduce a double brilliancy at half price.\r\n\r\nThe funeral processions are rather singular; and the interment of a\r\nchild particularly would appear to be the season of rejoicing rather\r\nthan grief. On these occasions the musical performers are the most\r\nchoice and costly. The corpse is never kept more than one day from\r\nthe time of the demise, and the funeral rites are usually celebrated\r\nafter dark; every one that chooses enlisting into the procession by\r\nthe acceptance of a wax-light. At a funeral which I saw at the Carmo,\r\na large and handsome church adjoining the royal chapel, two lines of\r\npersons were ranged along the body of the building, from the entrance\r\ntowards the altar, facing each other, every one holding a wax-light,\r\nnearly six feet high, in the right hand, and projected rather forward.\r\nSome of the individuals of this assembly might be friends of the\r\ndeceased, but the major part consisted of persons casually met with\r\nin the streets, or such as were led by curiosity into the church. The\r\nacceptance of a light is deemed an honour done to the friends of the\r\ndead, and the agents of the padres are not very scrupulous in forcing\r\nthem, if possible, into the hands of every one they see; the motive for\r\ndoing this is ascertained on knowing that the remainder of all candles\r\nwhich are used become the perquisite of those very _worthy_\r\nbrethren. At the head of the two lines, amounting to perhaps from one\r\nhundred to one hundred and fifty persons, the corpse was placed upon a\r\ntable or elevated platform, with the head exposed to view, while its\r\nlast vestments displayed the ill-founded notion of importance which\r\nits survivors attach to outward and meretricious show. The ceremony\r\nof itself not being calculated to impress the mind with awe, none of\r\nthose feelings of respectful gravity were visible, which so solemn an\r\noccasion ought to have produced. When it was finished, the body was\r\nconducted, with no regular procession, through some outer avenues of\r\nthe church, to the catacombs, situated in a passage opposite to the\r\njesuitical library. On arriving at an inner cemetery of the catacombs,\r\nthe lights of those who followed were extinguished and taken from them\r\nby the persons whose duty it was to secure this perquisite; and every\r\none retiring in consequence, the body disappeared by some other avenue,\r\nand I could not possibly discover how it was afterwards disposed of.\r\nUpon another occasion of the funeral obsequies of a general officer,\r\nI attempted to see their mode of executing this last office; but,\r\nfrom the quickness with which they slid away, and the extinguishing\r\nof the lights, I was again disappointed. A friend, however, gave me\r\nthe following description of the interment of a girl, at which he was\r\npresent. After the ceremony and the music had ceased, they proceeded\r\nfrom the said church of Our Lady of Carmo to the catacombs, where he\r\narrived, with two or three others, at that point of the cemetery which\r\nwas to receive the remains. The padres had disappeared, and no one was\r\nthere but the father of the girl and a person who may be styled the\r\nsexton. The outer coverings had been taken off, and the girl appeared\r\nrichly dressed in embroidered muslin, with silk stockings, and new\r\nshoes on, as if equipped for an assembly. The coffin had no bottom,\r\nbut the body was supported upon a piece of satin, securely nailed\r\naround the upper part of it, when the nails being withdrawn from the\r\nsides, the father, who was not dressed in the sable vestments of a\r\nmourner but in those of a bridegroom, disgusted my friend by his wanton\r\nand unfeeling conduct, and at this moment threw a piece of muslin\r\nto the sexton, urging him to despatch by shouting out “_depressa,\r\ndepressa_.” The muslin being drawn over the face of the girl, a\r\nlarge quantity of quick lime was placed upon it, and another portion\r\nspread from the head along the breast to the body, with a quantity on\r\neach side, when the man, with much ceremony, formed a cross upon it\r\nwith his trowel. During the operation, the father, devoid of every\r\nproper sense of decency, cried out to him, “_Vamos, vamos_” (let\r\nus go); and, at another time, “_Vamos, depressa, filho da pouta_.”\r\nTo render this last exclamation into English would only wound the\r\nfeelings of those who do not understand it. Quick lime being now placed\r\nupon the flat stone of the cemetery, which runs horizontally a long way\r\nback, exhibiting its awful contents, the coffin was lifted up, and the\r\nnails of the end being also taken out, the body and piece of satin fell\r\nupon the quick lime, and the coffin was removed away. The cemeteries\r\nare afterwards walled up and plastered over in front. This father then,\r\nand even before, at the close of the church ceremony, embraced many\r\npeople for joy, invited some to go home with him to a grand supper\r\nprepared for the occasion, and felt convinced that his child was gone\r\nto Heaven. Two or three hundred pounds are occasionally expended at\r\nfunerals.\r\n\r\nThe catacombs are small but extremely neat, the first part forming a\r\nsquare, ornamented with vases, and containing aromatic shrubs and\r\nflowers, is surrounded with a sort of piazza, the inner walls of\r\nwhich present the front of cemeteries, neatly plastered and numbered.\r\nOpposite the entrance, and crossing the square, a door-way leads to\r\ninner avenues, lined with cemeteries, kept exceedingly clean and in\r\ngood order. At the extremity of one of these avenues is situated the\r\ngeneral charnel-house, where the bones are piled in accumulating\r\nmasses. After a certain lapse of time, the bones of individuals are\r\ntaken from the cemeteries, bound together, and a large label, with\r\ntheir names inscribed upon it, affixed to them, then piled upon the\r\nbones of their predecessors in the charnel house, where two tapers are\r\nconstantly burning; and it is not uncommon for the relatives of the\r\ndeceased to visit this house of the dead on a certain day in the year,\r\noffering prayers in their behalf.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the churches are open spaces, without seats or pews, and\r\nthe women sit down in the Turkish style; they, as well as the men,\r\noccasionally fall upon their knees, and, during mass, go through the\r\nceremonies of crossing their foreheads, chins, and breasts, at regular\r\nstated periods, frequently beating their bosoms with great vehemence,\r\nbut which probably must not be taken as a positive demonstration of\r\nsincerity, however imposing it may outwardly appear.\r\n\r\nThe relation of one more procession will enable the reader to form\r\nsome estimate of the religious character of this people. On the event\r\nof illness having assumed the appearance of terminating in death, the\r\nHost is conducted by one or more padres, and its usual attendants, in\r\nmuch pomp, with a burning of incense and the tinkling of bells, to the\r\nhouse of the dying person, to afford him the last consolations of his\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe procession of the Host requires from the public more obsequious\r\nreverence than all the other component ingredients of the Catholic\r\nfaith. Many persons prostrate themselves before it on their knees, in\r\nthe streets and balconies; others bend the body, and all take off their\r\nhats. I have frequently met this procession some miles in the country,\r\nthe padre mounted on horseback, carrying with the same facility as an\r\numbrella, a canopy in his hand, and under its sacred shade the Host,\r\nor emblem of the Holy Ghost, accompanied by some attendants uncovered,\r\nand robed in scarlet cloaks, also on horseback; the whole moving on\r\nat a quick ambling pace, with the tinkling of bells, the peculiarity\r\nof which announces their approach, producing an universal prostration\r\nof all persons, white and black, who may be in the fields or houses\r\nadjoining the road. There is one custom the Brazilians have, which,\r\nif sincere, cannot but be admired; every evening at sun-set, by a\r\nsimultaneous movement, they take off their hats in the public streets,\r\noffer up a prayer, or repeat Avi Marias; from which they have acquired\r\nthe habit of denoting that period of the evening by the term of Avi\r\nMaria. And they say so and so before Avi Maria, at Avi Maria, or after\r\nAvi Maria.\r\n\r\nI have been in the house of a Portuguese family at Avi Maria, when\r\nthey appear to repeat a short prayer, after which a general salutation\r\ntakes place, by saying “_boa noite_,” (good evening,) and holding\r\nout their hands, as if they were mutually bestowing a blessing. It is\r\nthe custom for all slaves to hold their hands out in a similar manner\r\nnight and morning, as soon as they see their superiors, for the purpose\r\nof offering a blessing, while their usual expression is “_Abençoa\r\nsenhor_.”\r\n\r\nRio de Janeiro, although the residence of the court, is centuries\r\nbehind in the comforts and enjoyments of civilized life. Strangers\r\nare disgusted with a first ramble through this city, and would not\r\nvoluntarily pay it a second visit. Friendly attention to foreigners,\r\nalthough they may have letters of introduction, the Brazilians are\r\nseldom or ever known to practise. After some ceremony, they follow\r\nthe person introduced to the top of the stairs, wait there till he\r\narrives at the bottom, subject him to the further form of turning\r\nround to receive their final salutation, and thus the matter briefly\r\nends. How different to the refinement of their neighbouring colonists,\r\nthe Spaniards, whose houses and tertulas, at Monte Video, at Buenos\r\nAyres, and all other parts of Spanish America, are open to strangers,\r\nwho experience every liberality and social attention from them. I was\r\nassured by an English gentleman, who has resided ten years in the\r\nBrazil, that he never witnessed any symptom of genuine hospitality,\r\nand he had notwithstanding acted with friendship to many; and to one\r\ngentleman, in particular, he had rendered frequent services, at whose\r\nhouse he had called on various occasions, and sometimes casually at\r\nthe dinner hour, but was never invited to take dinner or any kind of\r\nrefreshment. Even the principal people have no idea of the comforts of\r\nthe table; when they give feasts, it is with an extravagant profusion\r\nof dishes, without any regard to the arrangement, and unattended with\r\nany of that elegant ease and order practised by similar classes in most\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Jas. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  A FREE NEGRESS AND OTHER MARKET-WOMEN.]\r\n\r\nTo the want of encouragement and public spirit on the part of\r\nthe leading inhabitants, and the consequent unwise regulation\r\nof the government, may be attributed the present state of the\r\nprovision-market. The beef is of such a quality, that it is really\r\nquite disgusting to the sight. The cattle are certainly driven a\r\ngreat distance, and are in a wretched state on their arrival at the\r\ncapital; but this difficulty would be remedied by the adoption of a\r\ndifferent system. Beef now pays a small duty, and by law is sold at 30\r\nreas (or about 3d.) per lb. and one man has the contract; let it be of\r\nthe worst quality the price is the same; by the payment of an adequate\r\nsum a piece of good beef cannot be obtained. Let this important branch\r\nof commerce be thrown open, without any restriction of price; allow it\r\nto rest upon the basis of fair competition, and a good quality of this\r\narticle would be seen in the metropolis, without any great additional\r\nprice. Mutton is not very generally in use, particularly amongst the\r\nBrazilians; I have however seen some very good, which was fed by an\r\nEnglishman. Veal is rarely if ever seen. Pork is decidedly the best\r\nmeat obtained here. Vegetables and fruit are very abundant, and at\r\nreasonable prices. Potatoes are not produced, except by some of the\r\nEnglish; but they degenerate after a year or two, by continuing to\r\nplant from the same stock. Poultry of all kinds is dear, and fish is\r\noccasionally so, arising more from the indolence of the fishermen, than\r\nany scarcity, as the bay and outside of the bar furnish an abundance,\r\nand some of a very fine flavour. Upon the whole, living at Rio is as\r\nexpensive or more so than in London, with none of the comforts of the\r\nlatter place. A house two stories high, consisting of a store below,\r\nand accommodation for a moderate sized family above, will let for two\r\nhundred and fifty or three hundred pounds per annum; and houses in the\r\nvicinity of the city, with little comparative convenience, will rent\r\nat seventy or eighty pounds a year; while those more commodious are\r\nproportionably higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP.

The Brazilians residing\r\nhere, and in the vicinity are denominated _Cariocas_ by the\r\nEuropean Portuguese; the meaning or origin of which term I could not\r\nlearn; the latter falsely considering themselves much superior to the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nThe mulattoes are a portion of the population much the most healthy and\r\nrobust, their mixture of African and Brazilian constitution appearing\r\nexactly adapted to the climate. The negroes are probably not used with\r\nmore inhumanity here than in other colonies. In the interior they are\r\ntreated much better than at Rio de Janeiro, where, in some instances,\r\nmuch cruelty is practised. For a trifling offence, they are sometimes\r\ncommitted to the charge of two or three soldiers, who pinion them with\r\ncords, and beat them in the most unfeeling manner along the streets,\r\nto the Calobouco, a prison for the blacks, where they are destined\r\nperhaps to receive a severe castigation before they are liberated.\r\nTheir owners procure an order from the intendant-general of the police,\r\nfor one, two, or three hundred lashes, according to the dictates of\r\ntheir caprice or passion, which punishment is administered to those\r\npoor wretches by one of their own countrymen, a stout, savage-looking,\r\ndegraded Negro. A gentleman obtained an order for the flagellation of\r\none of his runaway slaves, with two hundred lashes. On his name being\r\ncalled several times, he appeared at the door of a dungeon, where the\r\nnegroes seemed to be promiscuously confined together. A rope was put\r\nround his neck, and he was led to a large post, in the adjoining yard;\r\naround which his arms and feet were bound, while a rope secured his\r\nbody in like manner, and another, firmly fastened round his thighs,\r\nrendered the movement of a single member wholly impossible. The black\r\ndegradado set to work very mechanically, and at every stroke, which\r\nappeared to cut part of the flesh away, he gave a singular whistle.\r\nThe stripes were repeated always upon the same part, and the negro\r\nbore the one hundred lashes he received at this time with the most\r\ndetermined resolution. On receiving the first and second strokes he\r\ncalled out “_Jesu_,” but afterwards laid his head against the side\r\nof the post, not uttering a syllable, or asking for mercy; but what he\r\nsuffered was strongly visible in the tremulous agitation of the whole\r\nframe. The scene was deeply afflicting, and it was to be regretted that\r\nthe man who was capable of such fortitude should be in a condition that\r\nsubjected him to so painful and degrading an infliction. He received\r\nthe other one hundred lashes on the third day following, after which, a\r\nheavy iron chain to his leg, and an iron riveted round his neck, from\r\nwhich a trident stood up above the head, by way of ornament, would be\r\nno pleasant appendages with which to pursue his usual labour.\r\n\r\nThere are men who profess to be catchers of runaway negroes, and\r\nfrequently detain and ill use them when they are proceeding upon their\r\nemployment, keep them confined during a night, conduct them home tied\r\nwith ropes, and pretend they have detected them running away, for which\r\nthey demand certain charges and a recompense. I was present when two\r\nof those fellows brought a poor negro girl whom they had detained, and\r\nit was proved that they stopped her when she was really in pursuit of\r\nher occupation. They failed in receiving the recompense they so basely\r\nsought, but they ought to have been made a severe example of. It is\r\npainful to observe, that if a negro is stopped, or forced away, or in\r\nany manner ill-treated, nobody takes his part or believes his story.\r\n\r\nA great many persons live entirely in idleness, upon the earnings\r\nof one, two, or three slaves, who are denominated “_negros de\r\nganho_,” and stroll about the streets for employment: they are\r\ndistinguished by a large basket which they carry; others of both sexes\r\nare employed in carrying water in tubs, from the fountains, for the\r\nsupply of the inhabitants; the fountains are crowded all day, and are\r\nattended by a couple of soldiers to preserve order. The streets after\r\ndark are most offensively filled with negroes, carrying tubs of soil\r\nto empty at the beach, a water-closet, or privy, not being known in\r\nthis city. If these negroes do not bring a certain sum of money to\r\ntheir owners at night, the penalty is generally a severe castigation.\r\nMany of the negro slaves are remarkably well formed, particularly some\r\nof those who labour at the custom-house, and exhibit much muscular\r\nstrength about their whole frames, combined with such symmetry of form,\r\nthat the lineaments and swelling muscles of their naked bodies reminded\r\nme of some fine antique models. They wear cotton trowsers, the rest\r\nof the body being exposed. The principal part of the importations are\r\nremoved from the custom-house by them, and their dreadful shoutings\r\nand yellings, as a stimulus under their burdens, resound through the\r\nstreets and suburbs all day. Few waggons are used, and those of a rude\r\nconstruction; the axle-trees, revolving with the wheels, produce a loud\r\nand discordant noise.\r\n\r\nThe humane attempts of some English merchants to introduce waggons,\r\nfor conveying goods from the custom-house, were effectually opposed\r\nby the clerks of that establishment, who have the privilege through\r\nintrigue of exclusively letting out their slaves for this employment.\r\nThe universal diet of the negroes is the farinha, or flour, of the\r\nmandioca root, which they mix up with warm water, and occasionally are\r\nindulged with a little _toucinho_, or fat bacon, to it; but in the\r\nmining districts they use the flour of Indian corn, which a negro, who\r\nhad worked at the gold mines, informed me, was preferred amongst them\r\nto the first. The Brazilians themselves use a great deal of farinha,\r\nmany families almost subsisting upon it; and when dressed up, as is\r\nthe custom in some parts of the Brazil, particularly at Pernambuco,\r\nwith green peppers, &c. into a state they call _pirao_, it is\r\nvery palatable. _Feijaos_ and _carne-secco_, which are black\r\nbeans and dried beef stewed together, is a dish much used amongst the\r\nBrazilians, and an European with a sharp appetite will not find it a\r\nbad relish.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Jas. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n    NIGHTMAN.      WATER CARRIER.      WASHER-WOMAN.]\r\n\r\nThe slave-ships arriving at the Brazil present a terrible picture\r\nof human wretchedness, the decks being crowded with beings as\r\nclosely stowed as it is possible, whose melancholy black faces, and\r\ngaunt naked bodies, are of themselves sufficient to transfix with\r\nhorror an individual unused to such scenes, independently of the\r\npainful reflections connected with a consideration of the debasing\r\ncircumstances and condition of this portion of mankind. A great many\r\nof them, as they are seen proceeding from the ships to the warehouses\r\nwhere they are to be exposed for sale, actually appear like walking\r\nskeletons, particularly the children; and the skin, which scarcely\r\nseems adequate to keep the bones together, is covered with a\r\nloathsome disease, which the Portuguese call _sarna_, but may more\r\nproperly be denominated the scurvy. The poor wretches undergo painful\r\nremedies to prepare them as speedily as possible for market. If a\r\nvisit to the street of warehouses appropriated to their reception be\r\noccasioned by a desire of gratifying curiosity, the sentiments brought\r\ninto operation by such a scene will soon hurry the visitor away in pity\r\nand disgust. They are crowded together without regard to sex, and made\r\nto sit down in rows upon the ground, being by turns roughly forced\r\nupon their feet, for the purpose of exhibiting their bodily powers to\r\na purchaser. Negroes are become very dear; those that might have been\r\nprocured three years ago for thirty-five or forty pounds, are now worth\r\nsixty or seventy.\r\n\r\nStrangers coming here are also subject to the _sarna_, as well\r\nas the natives, which is an irruption attended with considerable\r\nirritation and itching about the legs, feet, and ancles, and becomes\r\ntroublesome unless great care is taken, by washing them every night\r\nwith warm water and _cachaça_. The _bicho_ is also another\r\nannoyance peculiar to the climate, ever filling the air, the water, and\r\nthe earth with new and infinite animation. This insect generates in\r\nthe dust and sand, and penetrating the foot not larger than an atom at\r\nfirst, increases to the size of a small white worm, giving considerable\r\npain till extracted; in doing which, it is necessary to remove all the\r\nlittle eggs which it leaves behind, otherwise they would soon acquire\r\nlife, and, if allowed, eat away the foot. I have seen numbers of\r\nnegroes, whose legs and feet, with the aid of the _sarna_, have\r\nbeen literally destroyed, and almost corroded away by them. The little\r\nblack boys sitting down, and extracting them from their feet with a\r\npin, reminded me of the celebrated bronze figure of a boy, in the\r\nattitude of taking a thorn from his foot, which occupies a place in the\r\nSalle de Laocoon, at the Louvre.\r\n\r\nIn traversing the woods, the _carrapato_, with which the branches\r\nfrequently swarm, is an annoying and dangerous enemy. It is similar\r\nin appearance to a sheep-tick, and introduces the head and main part\r\nof the body into the flesh, when, if taken away forcibly, it leaves a\r\ndisagreeable wound. One of these vermin penetrated the leg of the King,\r\nand, being injudiciously forced away, caused a wound, which has been\r\noccasionally troublesome to his Majesty ever since. The application of\r\noil is deemed an efficacious mode of removing them; but I found this\r\nineffectual, after using it copiously for about half an hour on one\r\nthat was nearly buried in the ear of a negro-boy.\r\n\r\nOn first arriving here, the inharmonious sounds which begin to annoy\r\nthe ear about Avi Maria, sent forth by field-crickets, frogs, toads,\r\nand other reptiles, are quite alarming to a stranger, who anticipates\r\nat every step, if he walks into a shacara, to encounter some venomous\r\ncreature. It is custom alone that reconciles this loud, unceasing,\r\nnocturnal clamour. Lizards are very numerous, some of a green colour.\r\nThey are timid, and are constantly seen running across the roads, up\r\nwalls, or rustling amongst the hedges. The vampire-bat is very large\r\nhere, and if they can get access to the stables will fix upon a horse,\r\nand suck the blood. I have seen the back of a horse quite saturated\r\nwith it, in consequence of a bite from one of them. They are said to\r\nfan their wings, during this sanguinary proceeding, in order to assuage\r\nthe pain which their bite creates. It is supposed that they would fix\r\nupon the human body in the same way; and this is probable, from the\r\nfollowing circumstance. In consequence of the excessive heat, I was\r\nin the habit of leaving open the shutter of my bed-room. One evening\r\nI discovered a vampire-bat, as large as two hands, upon the bed-post,\r\nand, by a blow, stunned it, so that it could not escape by the window,\r\nbut secreted itself in the room. During the night it got twice upon the\r\nbed, but the heat preventing a sound sleep, I was quickly awakened by\r\nits attempts.\r\n\r\nIt is too well known, perhaps, to remark that the Brazil is not the\r\nseat of literature; in fact, its total absence is marked by the\r\nprohibition of books generally, and the want of any single medium\r\nthrough which its inhabitants can attain even to a knowledge of the\r\nexisting state of the world, or what is passing in it. The inhabitants\r\nare principally involved in great ignorance and pride, its usual\r\nconsequence; an acquirement of the modes and ceremonies attached to\r\nthe pompous observance of their religion appearing to be deemed quite\r\nadequate to all the purposes of the present system of society. A\r\nliberal literary institution of any kind throughout the state, or a\r\nstimulus to a man of talent, would be looked for in vain. A gazette,\r\npublished twice a week, is printed at the royal press, the only one\r\nestablished here; but it affords to the people no intelligence of\r\nthe state of their own country or that of others. It is the size of\r\na sheet of small letter-paper, and is filled with the arrivals and\r\ndepartures of vessels, and some advertisements, while occasionally two\r\nor three heads are extracted with caution from the English newspapers.\r\nIn the whole of the Brazil there is only one other gazette, and that\r\nis published at Bahia. Its neighbouring colony of Spanish South\r\nAmerica has already begun to dispel the ignorance in which it was\r\nalike enveloped, by the establishment of several public colleges in\r\ndifferent places, and the liberal and free introduction of books,\r\nwhich will fast promote the spirit of learning that partially begins\r\nto dawn. Jealousy, which acquires a greater sway, from this confined\r\nstate of education and knowledge, obtains unbounded influence over\r\nthe minds of many of the Brazilians, and operates in some instances\r\nto such a degree that its victims are degraded much below the savage:\r\nthey do not declare their resentment openly, and demand frankly that\r\nredress or explanation which a man sustaining a real or imaginary\r\ninjury from another has a right to require; but they seek in privacy\r\nthe destruction of the object who may have created in their breasts\r\nsentiments of revenge, frequently resting upon a false and unjust\r\nfoundation, but which the inveteracy of this diabolical passion will\r\nallow them neither to investigate nor to solicit what in Europe is\r\ndeemed a fair and honourable satisfaction. Jealousy is a highly\r\npraiseworthy feeling when it is regulated with candour and justice,\r\nbut allied with the vile cowardice of clandestine assassination,\r\nperpetrated by the hands of the party themselves, or through the medium\r\nof a hired agent, it is of all others the most wicked and hellish that\r\ncan actuate the human mind.\r\n\r\nThat instances have occurred in the Brazil wherein both those modes\r\nhave been practised, for the gratification of this passion, unjustly\r\nindulged, is but too true. An English gentleman, who has resided in\r\nthe Brazil nearly forty years, informed me of a circumstance which\r\nhe witnessed in this city, previously to the arrival of the royal\r\nfamily. A British officer, whose ship was taking in refreshments here,\r\non passing through the Palace Square to a boat waiting to take him\r\non board his vessel, suddenly received a _facada_ by a person\r\nwho drew a knife from under a capote, or cloak, (which the Brazilians\r\nare in the habit of wearing), concealed for the purpose, and which\r\nterminated his existence. It was said that this wretch had unjustly\r\nencouraged a feeling of jealousy against the British officer in regard\r\nto his wife, or some part of his family. Many of the Brazilians carry\r\nknives, hid under the sleeve of their capotes, which they throw and use\r\nwith great dexterity. I was horror-struck to see at Rio the samples of\r\nan importation of knives from England, manufactured expressly for this\r\npurpose. In cases of quarrels amongst themselves they frequently use\r\nthem, and quickly fold the capote around the left arm, which serves for\r\na sort of shield.\r\n\r\nReligious _festas_, as has been before stated, are occurring\r\nweekly, and amongst other _funçons_, as they are called, one\r\nannually takes place in the beautiful island of Paquata, one of the\r\nfairest and most picturesque in the bay. The English merchants are\r\ngenerally applied to for subscriptions for this festival, which they\r\naccord with their accustomed liberality. It is a delightful water\r\nexcursion, which, added to the charms of the island itself, induce\r\nall the world to be of the party, and under the religious cloak of\r\nthese occasions, females always appear in public. A worthy captain\r\nof an English merchantman was induced, upon one of those festivals,\r\nrecently, to accompany a party in his own boat; and, the mode of\r\nrefreshment being of the pic-nic kind, he came in contact with an\r\nadjoining group, including several females, to whom he was tempted to\r\npay some attention, and thereby unconsciously excited the jealousy of\r\na monster in the shape of a human being, who was of the party; and\r\nat the moment of his departure from the island, the boat having only\r\nproceeded some yards, a knife was thrown with such unerring aim at\r\nhim that it produced his immediate death. That blacks, slaves, and\r\nothers, are hired to commit such atrocities, by the payment of a small\r\nrecompense, is a fact affirmed to be notorious; one authenticated\r\ninstance will be sufficient to show that it is too correct. It is\r\nwithin a short period that the inhabitants of Pria Flemingo were much\r\nshocked at the discovery of a dead body upon that beach, decapitated,\r\nand in a state of nudity, so that no trace was left to find out who\r\nthe unfortunate individual might be. This mysterious circumstance\r\nexcited deep interest, and produced the offer of a reward for the\r\ndetection of the perpetrator of so foul a deed. During the interval\r\nthat the matter was involved in uncertainty, it was known to the friars\r\nof a monastery that one of their members was missing; but, it would\r\nappear, nothing was said by them regarding the lost brother, from\r\nthe apprehension, probably, that something vicious or improper might\r\narise out of the investigation, not quite honourable to their sect.\r\nAt last, from a fear of detection, and a consciousness of guilt, the\r\nreal culprit came to the determination of communicating the affair\r\nto the King, presuming upon the known mercy of his Majesty, which is\r\nso unbounded that few persons have suffered the punishment of death\r\nsince he ascended the throne, although it is possible the royal\r\nforbearance may have frustrated, in some instances, the just expiation\r\nof guilt.[14] On this occasion also the criminal was not brought to\r\njustice, who, it is ascertained, was a fidalgo, whose jealousy was\r\nroused by the frequent visits the friar already mentioned paid to his\r\nwife, for the professed purpose of exacting the confessional duties\r\nof herself and family. It is not ascertained whether he had any real\r\ncause or not for the excitement of this passion; he unquestionably\r\nconceived he had, from the measures which he adopted of engaging two\r\nor three blacks to embrace an opportunity of murdering the friar,\r\nsevering the head from the body, and divesting him of his sacerdotal\r\nrobes. The discovery of the body was made under circumstances that did\r\nnot involve those who found it in any difficulty; but it is possible\r\nthat an innocent individual finding a dead person, unacquainted with\r\nthe customs of the country, might be subjected to some inconvenience;\r\nand I had almost got into such a predicament myself. Not far from the\r\nCampo de St. Christovao, a beach leading to the point of Cajú affords\r\nan interesting view of the bay. I had just entered upon it one evening,\r\nin September, on horseback, when I was startled at the appearance of\r\na dead man extended upon the sand, which the receding tide had just\r\ndeposited there: he was very well dressed, in the habit of a sailor,\r\nand, the hair being of an auburn colour, I concluded he was the mate of\r\nan English ship. My endeavours to procure the aid of some Portuguese\r\nat a short distance were unavailing; no one would approach; and two\r\nor three persons in a cabriolet, who passed close by, regarded me and\r\nthe dead sailor with indifference. I also addressed myself to the next\r\nperson who came up on horseback; he dismounted, and I immediately\r\nfound that he was an Englishman: he turned the body over, when the\r\nface appeared terribly mangled; he suggested that the property upon\r\nthe person should be secured, which amounted to upwards of one pound\r\nin Portuguese money, a silver watch, a gold brooch, and other things,\r\nof which an account was taken and delivered to my care, with which I\r\npurposed going directly to the minister of police, and to request that\r\nthe body might be taken care of, as it was impossible to get any one\r\nin the neighbourhood to take it in, or even come near the place. After\r\npaying two negroes to move the body from the beach, and place it under\r\na hedge, I set off to carry my intentions into effect. On the road\r\nto the city I met an English gentleman, to whom I stated the matter;\r\nhe requested me by no means to go to the police-office, as I should\r\nunquestionably be detained and lodged in prison till I proved that I\r\nwas not the cause of the man’s death. This information deterred me\r\nfrom proceeding farther; but the idea that this unfortunate individual\r\nmight have a wife, children, and friends at home, determined me to\r\nprepare an account of his person, with a view of posting it at the\r\ncustom-house next morning, which might have led to an identification of\r\nhis person. I previously called upon Mr. Harrison, a highly-respectable\r\nand long-resident merchant here, and he effectually convinced me of the\r\nhazardous consequences of a further interference in it. One gentleman\r\nsaid, “If you see a dead body, gallop off;” another, “If you perceive a\r\ndispute, from which one of the parties is likely to lose his life, fly,\r\nor you may be compelled to prove that you were not accessory to his\r\ndeath.” I immediately deposited the property at the British Consul’s\r\noffice, being under some apprehension, but I never heard more of the\r\nmatter. No doubt the body became a prey to the dogs and wild birds, and\r\nthe friends of this poor man will most probably never hear of his fate.\r\n\r\nUpon being detected in the commission of a crime, the perpetrator\r\nfrequently flies to the altar of a contiguous church; where I once saw\r\na criminal remain for several hours, being privileged from capture till\r\nan order was obtained from the bishop for his arrest. This, like many\r\nother observances of the Roman Catholics, is a practice derived from\r\nthe Mosaic law.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending the execution of the criminal alluded to\r\nin the last note were rather singular, although common here upon such\r\noccasions. He was conducted on foot for a considerable distance through\r\nthe streets, accompanied by padres, to the place of execution. There he\r\nwas laid upon his back against the upper part of the ladder attached to\r\nthe scaffold, and, on the rope being fastened round his neck, he was\r\npushed off, with a negro upon his shoulders to accelerate his death.\r\nThe head and hands were afterwards severed from the body and placed at\r\neach angle of the gallows, as represented in the plate.\r\n\r\nThe regular military force of Rio de Janeiro, and the immediately\r\nsurrounding district, may be estimated at five thousand men, consisting\r\nof two regiments of infantry and one of cassadores from Portugal, some\r\nregiments of Brazilian infantry and cavalry, mulattoes and blacks,\r\nincluding the royal guard, exceedingly ill mounted and ineffective.\r\nThe police of the city consists of a regiment of infantry and cavalry;\r\nthis department appears to be well arranged. Although the principal\r\nplan for the protection of the Brazil is the militia law, to which\r\nall the inhabitants are liable, yet, in point of discipline they are\r\nvery deficient, but in dress and equipment they reach mediocrity.\r\nNone of the regular regiments are in a state of good discipline;\r\nthose from Portugal are the best, but they are dissatisfied with the\r\nBrazilian service, and I was assured by one of their officers that\r\nthey have relaxed very much in their duty. The mining districts and\r\nthe other adjoining provinces are furnished with light cavalry, to\r\nwhich may be added the militia, who are usually called out for exercise\r\non Sundays and holidays. The force at Monte Video amounts to eight\r\nthousand men, under General Le Cour, and the troops under General\r\nRego (the Captain-General) at Pernambuco, are decidedly under the best\r\ndiscipline. Those two officers served with Lord Wellington in the\r\npeninsular campaign. The thirty-eighth British regiment proceeding to\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope put into Rio de Janeiro for refreshment; the\r\nmen being permitted occasionally to go on shore were soon recognised\r\nby one of the regiments from Portugal as their companions in war. The\r\nsalutations which occurred between them induced the King to make some\r\ninquiries respecting this regiment, when he expressed his desire to\r\nsee them reviewed, which the commanding officer acceded to. Boats were\r\nfurnished to convey them up the bay to the Campo of St. Christovao,\r\nwhere they went through their evolutions with such precision that the\r\nroyal family, and nearly the whole population of Rio and its vicinity,\r\nassembled upon the spot, were much gratified, and spoke highly of their\r\nfine military appearance.\r\n\r\nSince the removal of the court to the Brazil, a bank has been\r\nestablished in this city, which commenced upon the plausible plan of\r\naffording great facility to commerce, by discounting bills at the\r\nrate of six per cent.; but this banking company soon curtailed these\r\naccommodations, on finding that, through private channels and agents,\r\nthey could obtain ten, twelve, and fifteen per cent. by making loans,\r\nand advancing their notes upon securities not of the first character\r\nand validity. In order to provide against this sort of traffic, and\r\nacquire an unfair advantage over the public, they had the address\r\nto convince the King that they were entitled to have a prior claim\r\nover the property of an insolvent before other creditors, and, in\r\nconsequence, his Majesty, (then Prince Regent,) passed laws, of the\r\n24th September, 1814, and the 16th February, 1816, conceding to them\r\ncertain preferences; and, by a decree of the 29th November, 1818, he\r\ngranted them the full privilege of a first and distinct claim, before\r\nall other creditors, which is tantamount to the important public right\r\nthe British government, by virtue of extents, have over the national\r\nproperty in the hands of any individual, and which every state can,\r\nwith equal justice, practise for the security of its revenue. But that\r\nsuch a preference should be allowed to a body of merchants, trading\r\nfor gain, over other claimants precisely in the same circumstances,\r\nis an innovation upon the laws of commerce not founded in justice. In\r\nmost instances, our own countrymen will be found to be the greatest\r\nsufferers, their liberal accommodations being too often unfairly\r\ntaken advantage of. The bank declared a dividend of twenty per cent.\r\nlast year; and, notwithstanding the profitable operations which\r\nafforded such a result, it was very recently involved in a temporary\r\nembarrassment, arising principally from the want of a competent\r\nknowledge of those financial arrangements, foresight, and ingenuity,\r\nso important and essential in the direction of a banking concern. In\r\nthis dilemma, the directors received effectual pecuniary aid from the\r\nEnglish house of Messrs. Samuels, Phillips, and Co. established here,\r\nwith the same promptitude which marks the financial transactions of its\r\nconnexions in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe revenue raised in the Brazil is computed at from six to seven\r\nmillions sterling, including the pecuniary aid the government receives\r\nfrom Portugal, but which sum is not adequate to the demands upon the\r\ntreasury; many remaining in arrears, and others, with more influence,\r\ngetting their claims liquidated, after much delay. The military\r\nestablishment would not appear to require a very large sum, the militia\r\nnot creating an item of much expense, and the navy being in a very\r\ninefficient state: it would, therefore, be difficult, on a first view\r\nof the subject, to account for an expenditure at all proportionate to\r\nthe income arising from any apparent establishments for the security\r\nof the state; but as no details of the financial situation of the\r\ncountry, or the appropriation of the revenue, are ever published, the\r\ncause of the embarrassment under which the treasury labours can only\r\nbe arrived at through the medium of piece-meal information. From the\r\naggregate of such intelligence it is fair to conclude that the great\r\nitem which disorganizes the financial wheel has its origin not only\r\nin the great accumulation of individuals about the court, but also\r\nin every department of the state. The King is a man of an easy and\r\namiable disposition, and, from a wish to do something for every one,\r\nit is manifest, he has been led to sanction the increase of public\r\nsituations to an extent beyond what is required. Few European courts,\r\ncomparatively speaking, have so many persons attached to them as\r\nthe Brazilian, consisting of fidalgos, ecclesiastics, and numerous\r\nattendants. Few governments have so prodigious a number employed\r\nin the discharge of public affairs, compared with those holding\r\nappointments here. In addition to the three hundred mules and horses at\r\nSt. Christovao, there is an equal number in the stables at the city,\r\nnot kept for the use of the royal family alone, but for the supply of\r\nfidalgos and the numerous individuals composing the retinue of the\r\ncourt; and, with all this expense, there is no appearance of splendour\r\nor elegance. The carriages are large unwieldly cabriolets, drawn by\r\nmules; and a fidalgo will be seen using the whip rigorously from his\r\nseat in the vehicle, although a postilion is mounted upon one of the\r\nmules, to whose management one would expect the whole matter to be\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary number of persons about the court and government are\r\neasily distinguished from their practice of wearing cocked hats. The\r\nribands and orders at the button-holes of clerks, and the prodigious\r\ndisplay of stars by fidalgos, merchants, and even shopkeepers, which\r\ntheir taste for public show induces them daily to exhibit, prove that\r\nthese sort of decorations are procured with much facility in the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nMany of the claims upon the treasury are satisfied by bills upon\r\nthe other captaincies, and few military or other persons, receiving\r\nappointments to distant places, do not take an order upon the treasury\r\nof that province for the liquidation of their arrears; and the\r\nprovincial _erarios_ are frequently in the same difficulties, in\r\nconsequence of those demands. The treasury of Rio draws largely upon\r\nBahia and Pernambuco. The latter has generally of late liquidated such\r\ndemands to the amount of thirty contas of reas (about £9000) per month;\r\nbut it is not unusual for English merchants receiving those securities\r\nto hold them for a long period before payment can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian government unquestionably might boast of being one of\r\nthe richest in the world, if the immense capabilities of the country\r\nwere administered with energy and spirit, and a due regard paid to\r\nthe measures requisite to derive only a fair portion from them of the\r\nadvantages they present. The revenue of the Brazil arises principally\r\nfrom the following imposts, viz. one-fifth upon all gold; a decimo upon\r\nall productions of the land, upon the annual value of all houses and\r\nshacaras, upon slaves, upon the exchange of proprietorship of slaves\r\nand property. A duty upon all articles passing the river Parahiba\r\ninto the mining and interior districts, is collected at a register\r\nestablished for the purpose; and imposts are paid on passing various\r\nrivers with mules and horses. New negroes also pay an additional duty\r\non entering the interior districts. All cattle entering the province of\r\nRio de Janeiro pay a tax of nearly ten per cent.; the beef, besides,\r\npays a duty of five reas per pound.\r\n\r\nThe customs are a very important branch of revenue, and may be\r\nestimated to produce at Rio from five to six hundred thousand pounds\r\nsterling per annum, of which the English merchants pay upwards of three\r\nhundred thousand pounds, and that body collectively do not contribute\r\nupon the whole much less than six hundred and fifty thousand pounds\r\nsterling annually to the Brazilian customs: fifteen per cent. is paid\r\nby them upon all imports, (which by-the-bye is at present very unfairly\r\nlevied, but more of that hereafter,) and certain duties upon produce\r\nexported, which does not appear to be at all equal at the different\r\nmaritime towns. At Pernambuco fox instance, cotton pays six hundred\r\nreas per arobe. White sugar sixty reas per arobe, and brown sugar\r\nthirty reas, which, upon the average price of those articles when I\r\nleft that city, was from six to ten per cent. And at Rio a duty of two\r\nper cent. at the market price was, in 1819, laid, generally, upon all\r\nproduce exported. Coffee previously paid eighty reas per arobe, at a\r\nfixed price of two milreas and a half per arobe; and the price in 1819\r\nbeing about four milreas and two hundred reas, the government collected\r\nthe two per cent. upon the difference betwixt the two milreas and a\r\nhalf and the current value, which created some perplexity in levying\r\nthe tax upon that article; and as eighty reas upon the fixed price is\r\nabout two per cent. it would obviate this difficulty by repealing that\r\nlaw, and allowing the two per cent. to apply to the market price of\r\ncoffee as well as other articles. The only advantage to be obtained\r\nby the government, by continuing this mode, would be in the event of\r\ncoffee falling in value below two milreas and a half.\r\n\r\nThe government retain the diamond district of Serro Frio under their\r\nown management, and it is extraordinary that, during the last fifty\r\nyears, it has been so conducted, that this important branch of revenue\r\nhas been unproductive, and the establishment is considered to be\r\nembarrassed. The company, who had it by contract some years previous to\r\nits reverting to the government, acquired considerable wealth, partly,\r\nhowever, by intrigue, as their engagement bound them to a fixed number\r\nof negroes, and by bribery they introduced a great many more to work\r\nthe grounds, consisting of twelve or fourteen hundred square miles.\r\n\r\nTijuco is the residence of the governor of the diamond works, which\r\nare, and have been some years, under the jurisdiction of Senhor Camara.\r\nThe mode pursued of hiring all negroes, and making all purchases\r\nfor the establishment upon the spot, will tend to preclude its ever\r\nbecoming lucrative in the hands of the government. All persons who hold\r\nsituations under the governor are allowed the privilege of supplying a\r\ncertain number of negroes, and the eagerness, intrigue, and influence,\r\nexercised by all classes, to get their negroes employed, is a strong\r\ntestimony of some ulterior object, beyond the mere wages which can be\r\nthus acquired, and no doubt exists that an illicit traffic in diamonds,\r\nthrough this medium, is carried on to an immense extent. The royal\r\nfamily have the selection of the finest diamonds; and it is said that\r\nthe King possesses the best collection of gems in the world, worth\r\nupwards of two millions sterling. The diamonds are conveyed to Rio from\r\nTijuco, a distance of six hundred miles, under a strong military\r\nguard, and deposited in the treasury, till despatched for London, which\r\nis now their great mart. The gold mines are a much less profitable\r\nsource of revenue than they were formerly.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Jas. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  THE CASA OF A PADRE IN CAMPINHA.]\r\n\r\nAn English agriculturist would regard with astonishment and regret the\r\nextensive tracts of land lying waste in the Brazil, and particularly\r\nin the vicinity of the capital and principal towns. On accompanying\r\na party with Mr. M’Keand, from whom I experienced much attention, to\r\nCampinha, only eighteen miles from Rio, my surprise was more forcibly\r\nexcited to see that very fine champaign and extensive valley almost in\r\na wild state, and with its primitive and verdant woods. It is a plain,\r\ncomprising twenty-five or thirty square miles, interspersed with gentle\r\nacclivities, and encircled by graceful and softly undulating eminences,\r\npresenting a tranquillizing contrast to the more lofty contexture of\r\nalpine objects before described. It is a most inviting situation, and\r\nits self-producing vegetation reflects shame upon the indolence it has\r\ncontributed to create. One of the party joined me in a walk through the\r\nintervening woods, to a white house, finely situated upon an acclivity\r\nat the edge of the valley, and whose proprietor was a farmer of the\r\nsugar cane, and manufactured a fair quantity of rum. His son was a\r\npadre; and one end of the veranda formed a small chapel, garnished with\r\ntinsel trappings. It was Sunday, and the tocsin had already sounded the\r\nsignal for mass, and was gradually assembling its votaries. Many of the\r\nfemales, as in Scotland, walked without shoes and stockings. A spring\r\namongst some rocks, served as a purifying fountain, from whence they\r\nissued in silk stockings and embroidered shoes, ascended the hill into\r\nthe veranda, sat down on the floor, beat their bosoms, and with other\r\nbrief ceremonies concluded the devotional exercise. The padre sat down\r\nto gamble at cards, and some of the females danced not ungracefully\r\nwith the castinets.\r\n\r\nThe waste lands I had seen on this and other excursions were\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for, by the circumstances arising out of\r\nan attempt made by a friend of mine to purchase about twenty acres,\r\nsituated upon the margin of the bay, four miles by water and eight\r\nby land from the city. Its cultivation had extended no further than\r\nthe employment one solitary slave could give it; a few patches of\r\nmandioca were visible, and two rows of fruit trees, from the eminence\r\non which a clay tenement stood, formed a pathway towards the bay. Nine\r\nhundred milreas (upwards of two hundred pounds) was the sum demanded\r\nfor the everlasting possession of it, subject to the payment of a fine\r\nof five pounds per annum to a lady, whose assent to the transfer was\r\nrequired, and could be immediately obtained. My friend determined to\r\nbe the purchaser, and called upon the donna, to ascertain under what\r\ncircumstances the five pounds were to be paid. She had no objections\r\nto his becoming the purchaser; but said, she thought the sum demanded\r\nwas too much, and that she would send in a person to value the\r\n_bemfeitoras_; that is, what produce might be upon the ground, if\r\nthe party wished to sell it. He found, therefore, in place of its being\r\na free purchase, this lady had the full controul over the property, in\r\ncase of the occupier wishing to dispose of it. He would have purchased\r\nher five pounds fine; that she would on no account part with, and\r\nfurther stated, that, for every two slaves more that he employed, he\r\nmust pay five pounds more fine. The present holder was only to work it\r\nwith two. The object of this would seem to be, that, in the event of\r\nits being disposed of, she would not have so many _bemfeitoras_\r\nto take. This gentleman would have expended a considerable sum, and\r\nhave brought the land into a state of fine cultivation, if he could\r\nhave retained it in his own possession, and that of his successors in\r\nperpetuity; but, if circumstances compelled him to part with it, this\r\ndonna, by the Brazilian laws, would have had the preference; and two\r\npeople, appointed for the purpose, would have been sent to value the\r\nproduce standing upon the ground, without regard to improvement of\r\ntimes, or the amelioration of the soil; and, in consequence of this\r\nfine, she would have unfairly regained possession of the property for a\r\nmere bagatelle. This being the state of the case, my friend immediately\r\ndeclined any further treaty upon the subject. This donna and two\r\nsisters, all spinsters, possess a most extensive range of land, the\r\nwhole under similar circumstances, and nearly in the same condition\r\nthat it was left by the Indians. The parties occupying it live upon\r\nthe produce of fruit sold at market, and a little mandioca. Under the\r\npresent system of landed tenure, it will remain covered with wild grass\r\ntill doomsday.\r\n\r\nIt is a great misfortune to the Brazil, that extensive tracts of\r\nland have been granted to donatories, who do not possess the means\r\nof cultivating one-hundredth part of it, but hold it on under the\r\nexpectation that the gradual improvement of the country will render\r\nit daily more valuable, and the residence of the court here induces\r\nthem to adhere more strongly to this impression: if they dispose\r\nof any part of it, they generally subject it to a fine, and the\r\nconsequences attending such a contract will present a decided obstacle\r\nto the agricultural improvement of this country, at all proportioned\r\nto its extent or superabundant powers. Individuals who would devote\r\ntheir exertions and property to the culture of the soil, where this\r\nmode prevails, must be effectually deterred. The province of St.\r\nPaulo, which may be estimated to contain one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand square miles, has no land devoluto, or ungranted, although\r\none-thirtieth part of it is not in a state of cultivation. Land of\r\ncourse may be bought without a fine, but not generally. I had some\r\nconversation with a Portuguese gentleman, whose intention it was to\r\nobtain from his Majesty a grant of land to the extent of two or three\r\nsquare leagues, situated upon the northern bank of the river Parahiba;\r\nbut he could not have placed more than two slaves upon it, and his\r\navowed object was to retain it under the anticipation of futurity\r\nproducing him an advantage in the sale of it, by portions or otherwise.\r\nThe King is very liberal in granting land; and would, no doubt, afford\r\nencouragement for the agricultural improvement of the country, and even\r\nduring my short stay at Rio he supplied some individuals with slaves\r\nfor the purpose of cultivation; but the parsimonious feeling and apathy\r\nwhich prevails will operate against any speedy change or improvement\r\nof the system. In the donation of lands, it would be wise to attach\r\na positive obligation to cultivate, or in a certain period either\r\nto revert to the crown or be publicly disposed of to those who are\r\ncompetent, and intend to work them; and further, to grant lands only in\r\nquantities proportioned to the means the individual receiving them may\r\npossess of bringing them into a state of culture; otherwise it would\r\nbe infinitely better for the lands to remain with the crown, thereby\r\nprecluding the practice of retailing them out with a fine.\r\n\r\nThat small quantities of land, when well cultivated, are, from the\r\nexuberance of their productions, adequate to the maintenance, and even\r\nenrichment of a family, where industry prevails, is amply demonstrated\r\nby the shacara of Bella Fonta, consisting only of eight or ten acres,\r\nwhich is planted with African grass, having a thick stem, and a long\r\nand broad lancet leaf, affording grass all the year for daily cutting.\r\nWhen the circuit is made, and the point first commenced at reached\r\nagain, the grass is a second time in readiness, and so on. The amount\r\nof this supply affords food for four horses and two bullocks, besides a\r\nsurplus conveyed to the city by the latter, producing twenty shillings\r\nper week. The fruit trees, which beautify the walks that intersect\r\nthe grounds, together with a vegetable garden, yield beyond what is\r\nfully requisite for domestic consumption, upwards of two hundred\r\npounds a year more. It may be said that this situation is near the\r\ncapital and possesses advantages which land more distant could not; but\r\nthat observation cannot apply to the uncultivated tracts stretching\r\nalong both sides of the bay, enjoying even a greater facility of\r\ncommunication by water.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to be any great spirit of emigration from other\r\nstates of Europe to the Brazil, for the purposes of agriculture; the\r\nprincipal hitherto are French, and I conversed with some of that nation\r\nrecently arrived at Rio, with the view of forming coffee-plantations,\r\nbut their expectations appeared to be much moderated, from the system\r\nthey found existing. To go far into the interior, a man must be\r\nexpected to sacrifice all idea of society, and to reside amongst a\r\nclass of people who are strangers to the agreeable intercourses of\r\ncivilized life, to which he may have been accustomed. The French are\r\nunderstood however to assimilate themselves to the habits and usages\r\nof the country with more facility than any other European emigrants.\r\nThe remains of an unfortunate colony of Swiss emigrants arrived at\r\nRio in the month of October, 1819, having sailed from Hamburgh in\r\nships badly provided for their reception; nearly eighty died during\r\nthe voyage, including their medical attendant. The King, previously\r\nto their departure from Europe, had given them promises of land and\r\nencouragement; and those who escaped the fever amounting to about two\r\nhundred persons of both sexes, were to proceed, soon after I left Rio,\r\nto Canto Gallo, a very fine district, where they would receive an ample\r\ndonation of land to settle upon; and it is possible that, if the good\r\nintentions of the King are not frustrated by intrigue, they may form\r\na valuable and flourishing colony. Their known habits of industry and\r\nmorality would warrant the most favourable expectations from them.\r\nThe Brazilians were condemning this measure very much, and intimated\r\nthat the government might find plenty of their own nation to bestow\r\nthose lands upon; but the wise policy of the King, in manifesting\r\nthis encouragement towards these worthy Swiss emigrants, will be\r\ndemonstrated in the example of industry which they will furnish by\r\ntheir own personal exertions for the improvement of their property.\r\nThe Portuguese do not labour in the field, but every thing is done by\r\nslaves; and, if they were capable of investigating the state of their\r\ncountry, the inference would be, that they ought to hail the arrival\r\nof any class of individuals who would promote its improvement, rather\r\nthan feel a mistaken jealousy of them. Surely there is abundant scope\r\nfor all their exertions in a region containing nearly two millions of\r\nsquare miles, the sixtieth part of which is not in a proper state of\r\ncultivation. The mountains would universally produce coffee-trees; a\r\nMr. Mawke and a Mr. Le Sange have planted them with success in the\r\nvicinity of the Tejuca, the cascades of which place present one of the\r\nmost interesting objects near Rio.\r\n\r\nI accompanied a party from Bella Fonta to visit them. We passed the\r\nPedra Mountain and proceeded through that part of the valley called\r\n_Grande et pequena Andrahi_; the road was good, adorned with neat\r\nwhite houses, and fences of lime bushes, orange trees, and flowering\r\nshrubs. The ascent leading between higher mountains was till lately\r\nvery difficult of access, and the immense stones which rendered it so\r\nare distributed on both sides of the way. From its different winding\r\npoints we were gratified with varied and pleasing views of the valley,\r\nthe city, and the bay, the waters of which presented a silvery hue,\r\ncaused by the rays of the sun just diffused above the horizon; the\r\n_tout ensemble_ producing an animated and pictorial effect, in\r\nwhich the Pedra Mountain, resembling a hay-cock, and detached from\r\nall others, formed a singular feature. From the summit of the pass\r\nwe commanded a view of the sea on the opposite side, and had now to\r\ndescend by a narrow road of the utmost intricacy, covered with large\r\nstones, the horses at every step being liable to fall. It was, however,\r\na most romantic and delightful way; and, although it could not boast\r\nof any edifice beyond clay huts, it partook of all the grandeur of the\r\nmountain scenery before mentioned, with even more of sublimity in the\r\ngeneral and more versatile combination and expression of its objects.\r\nA continued charm was produced by a succession of waterfalls, forming\r\na murmuring stream below, and hid in the depth of its descending\r\nrecesses from the eye by embowering trees, which send forth the\r\nmusic of its feathered inhabitants, variegated in rich and beauteous\r\nplumage. Towards the bottom of the descent, stones of a prodigious size\r\nwere dispersed all around, the rivulet had accumulated into a more\r\nconsiderable body of water, and a lake, situated in the plain below,\r\nterminating its course, presented a crystal mirror. We alighted at a\r\nfarm-house, in the veranda of which the neighbouring population were\r\nassembled at mass, and proceeded on foot, by a rude pathway, along\r\nthe skirts of a wood, at the end of which a narrow opening through\r\nthe rocks astonished us with the view of those truly fine cascades.\r\nIt was indeed a profound and perfect seclusion, and the whole may be\r\ndeemed one of the _chefs-d’œuvre_ of nature, its most fanciful\r\nand wondrous operations being here conspicuously displayed. The fine\r\nplatform upon which the opening enters is nearly one hundred and fifty\r\nfeet square, and forms the centre of two cascades, the waters passing\r\nby a perpendicular rugged precipice of one hundred feet in height,\r\nand, flowing in a stream across it, descend by another of almost equal\r\naltitude. A fugitive bishop and his followers, wandering over these\r\nunfrequented mountains, in the year 1711, when the French had taken\r\npossession of the city, accidentally discovered this recluse situation,\r\nso well adapted for their concealment. They cut out niches in the\r\nrocks for the reception of saints, mutilated portions of which still\r\nremained. A large stone table and a seat formed of the rock served as\r\nconveniences for our repast, rendered doubly grateful by the noble\r\npeculiarity of the surrounding objects. We afterwards crossed the\r\nstream, and attempted to explore the precipitous ascent of the Gavea,\r\n\r\n                           “Whose hairy sides,\r\n    With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,\r\n    Access denied; and overhead up grew\r\n    Insuperable height of loftiest shade,\r\n    A woody theatre of stateliest view.”\r\n\r\nWith cautious steps we retraced our way, and the feelings which the\r\nwild and romantic nature of the scene inspired were heightened by\r\nthe murmuring waters of the hidden cascades. The district of Tejuco\r\nis extensive, and belongs principally to one individual, the Conde\r\nd’Asceca.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the Brazil has increased much since it was thrown\r\nopen, particularly in British manufactures, as they are now generally\r\nused throughout the whole territory. That this augmentation of British\r\ncommercial intercourse with that country, as well as the aggregate\r\nsum of the whole since its commencement, has been essentially\r\ndisadvantageous to the merchants and manufacturers of England, reducing\r\nit into one account, is unquestionable. Suppose the shipments of all\r\ngoods since the first, to a certain period, where a line could be\r\ndrawn, were placed on one side at prime cost, and the returns for those\r\nshipments in produce, bills, or specie, placed on the other side,\r\n(without taking into view the occasional great losses sustained by the\r\nsale of the produce,) it would then be too clearly demonstrated, and\r\nexhibit by the comparison an actual loss, amounting to a very serious\r\nsum. The testimony of one or two merchants connected with this trade\r\nsince its origin would suffice to show the immense sacrifices British\r\nproperty experienced soon after this new channel induced such large\r\nspeculations through its medium, as well as the continued sacrifices\r\nthat have been made at different periods since. Even the years 1819\r\nand 1820, and especially what has passed of the present one, have been\r\ndistinguished by considerable losses; and, if further corroboration\r\nwere required, the innumerable failures in England caused solely by\r\nthis deterioration of property might be adduced. I speak of the trade\r\nas a whole, allowing that a great many persons have done well in it,\r\nand some made fortunes, particularly the commission-merchants; but I\r\nmean to submit, that the advantages those individuals have derived will\r\nnot bear the test of comparison with the losses sustained by others.\r\nThe Brazilians, particularly at Rio, have acquired no inconsiderable\r\ngains out of the unfortunate circumstances detailed; besides, they\r\nenjoy advantages which they are little sensible of, in the supply of\r\nBritish capital, which, at the metropolis, where the longest credits\r\nare given, alone extends to more than one million sterling, arising\r\nfrom the too great liberality of the merchants resident there, in\r\ngranting credits with goods. The number of English establishments of\r\nall kinds at Rio amounts to about sixty, and a spirit of competition\r\nconsequently existing, the native merchants have had the address\r\nto turn it greatly to their advantage. For instance, if they could\r\npurchase goods from one house at four months credit, they would\r\ngive the preference to another that would give them six, and so on;\r\ntill credits have extended, in some instances, to nine, twelve, and\r\neven eighteen months, accumulating in their hands the prodigious\r\nsum mentioned, and which the Brazilian laws induce some few to take\r\nthe unfair advantage of retaining as long as they can, and in some\r\ncases altogether. English property, in this state of jeopardy, may be\r\ncomputed at two hundred thousand pounds, resulting from the tedious and\r\nimperfect mode of judicature. A Portuguese dealer, having exhausted\r\nthe patience of the English merchant, the latter obtains a summons\r\nfrom the English judge, Senhor Garces, for the former to appear before\r\nhim within three audiences, (he holds two a week,) when it is at the\r\noption of the plaintiff, whether the defendant is put upon his oath or\r\nnot. If he is put upon his _juramente d’alma_, and then swears\r\nhe owes nothing, the cause must finally end; but if the plaintiff\r\nwill not allow him to swear, he then probably denies altogether owing\r\nthe money, or admits the account, but says he cannot at present pay,\r\nwhich produces the same delay. The plaintiff then cites him for a\r\n_libello_, and proceeds to prove the fairness of his demand, which\r\nthe defendant opposes by counter declarations. Up to this point twelve\r\nmonths may be calculated as already consumed. The judge, convinced by\r\nthe clear evidence of the plaintiff, gives a _despatch_ in his\r\nfavour, which the other immediately _embargos_, when a plea for\r\nadditional time is set up, under the pretence of adducing some other\r\nevidence; and, after a further investigation, the judge gives a similar\r\n_despatch_ to the first, which is a second time _embargoed_,\r\nand the cause is then removed to the Court of _Relaçam_,\r\nconsisting of six or seven judges, three of whom must always attend.\r\nSimilar delays occur in this court, when the decision of the English\r\njudge conservator is confirmed, which, however, is not final; the\r\ndefendant can carry the case before the _Conseil de Fazendes_,\r\na supreme authority, consisting of many members, from whose decision\r\nthere is no appeal. The plaintiff, whose verdict gives him a power over\r\nthe property only of the defendant, and not over his person, proceeds\r\nto take possession of his premises and effects, when, in some cases,\r\nI have been informed, he discovers that another person holds them,\r\nin virtue of a purchase which he pretends to have made, although the\r\ndefendant is probably acting in the business as before. The plaintiff,\r\nin order to prove this fictitious sale, contemplates a delay of several\r\nyears in another law process; he therefore submits to any terms that\r\nmay be offered him.\r\n\r\nAn instance was related to me of a Brazilian who owed an English\r\nhouse eleven hundred pounds, and, being pressed for a settlement, he\r\ndisputed the delivery of a quantity of crockery-ware, amounting to nine\r\nhundred pounds, but which, from their great bulk, and the circumstances\r\nattending his receipt of them, afforded ample proof of the justness\r\nof the charge. In the course of the law-process he demanded the\r\nproduction of the plaintiff’s books, in which case every leaf of each\r\nbook is stamped, and pays a duty to government. The books afforded the\r\nclearest testimony of the sale and delivery. The defendant then put in\r\na document, suggesting that the plaintiff might have two sets of books,\r\nand this might be a false one; upon this the defendant was ordered to\r\nproduce his own books, for it is usual for this class of Brazilian\r\ndealers to keep a receiving-book, in which all goods are entered when\r\ndelivered at their shops. He however evaded this order, by replying,\r\nthat he kept no books, but wrote the receipt of all goods upon the back\r\nof the merchants’ invoices, and that he had never received the one in\r\nquestion. This subterfuge produced an immediate _despatch_ in\r\nfavour of the plaintiff, which the defendant may perhaps yet frustrate,\r\nby the dishonest proceedings mentioned. Hence, the laws appear to be\r\nrather a temptation to fraud than a preventive.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of an English judge conservator, who is indeed a\r\nrespectable man, and disposed to act with promptitude and justice,\r\nappears to be perfectly nugatory in cases of importance; and, although\r\nhis decisions may have some influence with the other courts, they are\r\nby no means final or effectual; and the same delay takes place, under\r\nsuch circumstances as have been described, as if this office did not\r\nexist. The privilege of having a judge, whose salary of £500 a year is\r\npaid out of the contribution fund, would appear to be conceded to the\r\nEnglish, without its producing any adequate advantage to them.\r\n\r\nFrom the universal taste for British manufactures, the Brazil presents\r\na great and decidedly increasing field for their consumption; and,\r\nalthough the merchants cannot get rid of the tedious practice in\r\nthe judicial proceedings, they may, by a system of caution, in some\r\ninstances, avoid it; and they have already adopted the plan of\r\ntaking bills from the Portuguese on delivery of goods, which is, at\r\nall events, an acknowledgement of the debt. It is still farther to be\r\nwished that the increasing demand for English goods would determine\r\nthe merchants not to part with their commodities under the real value.\r\nCompetition is, unfortunately, a great obstacle to any unanimity\r\namongst them in this respect, otherwise the Brazilians would have no\r\nalternative but to take their merchandise at any fair profitable price\r\nthat might be determined upon. At present the importations of British\r\ngoods annually to the Brazil may be estimated at near three millions\r\nsterling, one half of which may be computed to arrive at Rio, from\r\nwhence returns are made in bills, coffee, sugar, hides, &c. and some\r\ncotton. Orders are sent to Bahia, Pernambuco, and Maranham, to ship\r\nsome part of the return, principally in that article, from thence, for\r\nwhich they send specie, or bills upon the treasuries of those places,\r\nreceived from the government for stores supplied. At present two or\r\nthree English houses at Rio de Janeiro furnish the government with the\r\ngreat bulk of its military and naval stores; but, at different periods,\r\ndemands resulting from this connexion have met with serious delays\r\nin the liquidation, and in cases where the treasury has been under\r\npositive engagements by bills, great inconvenience has been sustained,\r\nand the parties compelled at last to wait personally upon the King, who\r\nhas given directions for the payment of those overstanding securities.\r\n\r\nThe British merchants also labour under some inconvenience, originating\r\nin the misconstruction of or non-compliance with the actual intent of\r\nthe convention for regulating the levying of the fifteen per cent. duty\r\nupon that portion of English goods not embraced by the _pauta_,\r\nand which latter instrument is additionally and injuriously partial in\r\nits operations, not being a fair standard by which the real value of\r\nthe article the duty is to be paid upon can be designated. The avowed\r\nobject between the two governments in this arrangement is, that the\r\nBritish merchant shall pay a duty of fifteen per cent. upon the fair\r\nvalue of the thing imported; but the _pauta_ enumerates a fixed\r\nvalue upon certain articles, without reference to the fluctuation of\r\nprice, and the tide having uniformly of late years flowed downwards\r\nin this respect, goods have experienced a diminution from the average\r\nvaluation of that instrument, consequently, the duty may amount to\r\ntwenty-five or thirty per cent. in place of fifteen, upon their actual\r\nworth. But this is not the only objection to it as an inefficient\r\nmedium for levying the duties. The _pauta_ determines the value\r\nof certain goods at one, two, or three prices, at the same time\r\nthat a great variety of qualities exist in the same commodity, which\r\ngradations of value are yearly increasing, by the introduction of\r\nmechanical power and other improvements into our manufactures. Some\r\nprinted cottons are worth upwards of two shillings per yard, others\r\nnine-pence or one shilling, with intermediate qualities. Cambric\r\nmuslins bear greater disproportions of quality, yet the duties are\r\nexacted upon goods of this kind, worth one shilling per yard, at the\r\nsame rate as those bearing twice the value. At Rio, where more fine\r\ngoods are used, they pay the same duty as the merchants of Bahia and\r\nPernambuco, where more of the lower quality of the same articles are\r\nimported; and, in consequence, the merchants of the latter place\r\nhave been entirely precluded, during the last eighteen months, from\r\ndespatching through the custom-house printed cottons and muslins of\r\na low price, as the valuation they hold in the _pauta_ would\r\nhave made the duty forty per cent. upon their real worth in lieu\r\nof fifteen per cent. Mr. Lempriere, the consul of Pernambuco, did\r\nnot conceive it his duty to interfere in the matter; but it would\r\nappear that the captain-general and the judge of the custom-house,\r\nwere either influenced by the diminution of customs collected, or\r\nby the representations of the merchants themselves, to accede to an\r\narbitration. Messrs. Cockshott, Mitchel, and Todd, three very competent\r\nand highly-respectable merchants, were selected, on the part of the\r\nEnglish, to meet three Portuguese merchants; and, in the month of\r\nJanuary, 1820, during my stay at Pernambuco, the matter was, for the\r\ntime being, amicably adjusted; but the nature of the _pauta_ will\r\never present great difficulties, and can never embrace the intended\r\nequitable duty upon the imports. The same objections have been raised\r\nat Bahia and other places. The arrangement above alluded to did not\r\nlong continue in operation, in consequence of not receiving the\r\nsanction of the Brazilian government. The difficulty is now greatly\r\naugmented by the continued depression in British manufactures. Printed\r\ncottons, rated in the _pauta_ at seven milreas four hundred reas\r\neach piece, and upon which valuation the duty of fifteen per cent. must\r\nbe paid, were not worth more than from three milreas two hundred reas\r\nto three milreas six hundred reas, in the Pernambuco market at the\r\nclose of 1820. This produces a result so manifestly against the British\r\nmerchant, that it must ultimately prove ruinous to him. Memorials have\r\nbeen presented to the Hon. Mr. Thornton, relative to these injurious\r\nconsequences of the _pauta_, and the British merchants connected\r\nwith the Brazil are in expectation that the attention of their\r\ngovernment will be drawn to this important subject, when its wise and\r\nenlightened policy will no doubt obtain the desired relief.\r\n\r\nThere can be but one opinion that the convention, if it applied\r\nto imports generally, is the only just principle upon which this\r\nmatter should rest, provided it were divested of the grievances just\r\nalluded to; for the accomplishment of which, the merchants of Bahia\r\nhave been the first to present a memorial to the Brazilian court. It\r\nwas understood, before I left Rio, that the measures which had been\r\npractised for the benefit of individuals, and not of the government,\r\nwere ordered to be discontinued by his Majesty, as contrary to the\r\nletter and spirit of the convention. Having, however, referred to those\r\npractices, it may not be irrelevant to state one instance out of many\r\nthat were communicated to me by the merchants at Rio de Janeiro. The\r\nobligations of the convention are, that the merchant shall give in an\r\nattested invoice of the value of the article, and if the government do\r\nnot consider it a fair one, they have the option of taking the goods\r\nby paying ten per cent. upon the price. A merchant received a quantity\r\nof goods, which, had he despatched at the cost price, he would have\r\nsustained a serious loss, in consequence of the low ebb at which they\r\nthen stood. In the course of twelve months, a demand arose for the\r\narticle, and he gave in an invoice at the cost price to pay the duties\r\nupon. The _administratador_ of the custom-house finding, (no\r\ndoubt from his agents,) that he could obtain a good profit, informed\r\nthe merchant that the ten per cent. in addition to the price given\r\nin, would be paid, and the goods kept; consequently the merchant was\r\ndeprived of any advantage he might have received from running the risk\r\nof retaining the goods for so long a time, without mentioning the loss\r\nof interest; besides, in those cases it has happened, that the goods\r\nhave been previously sold by sample to a dealer, who insists upon\r\ntheir delivery, or a pecuniary allowance. The merchant above-mentioned\r\nascertained that the goods were actually despatched through the\r\ncustom-house by the very invoice he presented, and the duty paid only\r\nupon the value he gave in; demonstrating that the government derived\r\nno benefit from those proceedings, but that they were the result of\r\nintrigue among inferior officers, for their individual gain. I cannot\r\nconclude this important subject, without strongly recommending to the\r\nBritish government the expediency of effecting, if possible, a change\r\nin the levying the duty of fifteen per cent. as far as the _pauta_\r\napplies, for it is obvious that an arrangement upon the principle of\r\nthe convention can alone embrace the infinite gradations of value\r\npeculiar to every denomination of British manufactures sent to the\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nIt may be here observed, that in all serious difficulties the English\r\nprefer going direct to the King, rather than encounter the different\r\nramifications of intrigue publicly known to exist in many departments\r\nof the state; and in all those applications his Majesty concedes a\r\nready hearing; and, as far as depends upon himself, the English have,\r\nindeed, every reason to acknowledge his readiness to accede to all\r\njustly founded requests.\r\n\r\nThe custom-house door at Rio de Janeiro, is the rendezvous of the\r\nmerchants, hitherto, not having the accommodation of an exchange.\r\nAn edifice, however, was commenced by the government, upon a\r\n_prainha_, or small beach, behind the custom-house, and it was\r\nanticipated that this _praca do commercio_, of which I obtained a\r\nplan from the architect, would be completed early in the year 1820.\r\n\r\nI was present when the foundation-stone of the first protestant church,\r\nin South America, was laid at Rio de Janeiro on the 12th of August,\r\n1819. It is for the use of the English, who at present assemble in a\r\nroom for divine service: the site is in the Rua dos Borbanes, near the\r\nconvent of Ajuda, and adjoining the house of the Spanish Ambassador.\r\nMr. Stevenson, the treasurer, and the committee for the management\r\nof the contribution fund, attended, together with a great portion of\r\nthe resident English merchants, when a very animated and appropriate\r\naddress was delivered by the Rev. Mr. Crane. Some coins of Great\r\nBritain, a glass bottle securely sealed up, and containing two or three\r\nEnglish newspapers of the latest date, (14th of June,) a gazette of\r\nRio de Janeiro, and a navy list, were deposited in the stone. This\r\nmain stone was dedicated to St. George and St. John, in honour of the\r\nsovereigns of England and Brazil. Mr. Johnson, before-mentioned, is\r\nthe architect, and a Portuguese the builder. Judging from the plan,\r\nthe structure will be neat, and calculated to contain about five\r\nhundred persons, and many more if galleries are added at any subsequent\r\nperiod. The Spanish Ambassador, who was looking out of a window during\r\nthe ceremony, had made an offer of part of the ground upon which his\r\nstables stood, it being deemed necessary to complete the ground-work,\r\nwhich offer was considered highly honourable to him and no obstacle\r\nwas foreseen in forwarding this good work with all possible despatch.\r\nThree months afterwards, however, nothing further had been done, in\r\nconsequence, I have heard, of the Portuguese dono of the ambassador’s\r\npremises, objecting to the transfer of the small portion of ground\r\nrequired, unless he was paid some exorbitant sum. I understand, that\r\nan application is to be made, through the medium of the Hon. Mr.\r\nThornton, to the King upon the subject.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Jas. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  THE RIO EXCHANGE, A PUBLIC TRAPICHE, A GRASS WAGON, & THE GALLOWS.]\r\n\r\nMacacu, which has a church dedicated to St. Antonio, and a convent\r\nof lazy Franciscans, is pretty considerable, and was created a town\r\nby King Peter II. in 1697. It is situated upon elevated ground, on\r\nthe left margin of the river of the same name, a little above the\r\nembouchure of the Guapiassu, and is about three leagues distant, in a\r\ndirect line from the bay, and almost ten by the course of the river.\r\nSince the year 1808, this place has been the residence of a _Juiz\r\nde Fora_, whose jurisdiction also extends to the town of Mage. The\r\npopulation of Macacu, including its district, amounts to nine thousand\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nVilla Nova, (de St. Joze d’ el Rey,) created a town in 1772, is two\r\nleagues to the south-west of Macacu, and a mile distant from the\r\nsame river. St. Barnabe was its original name when a village, and\r\nits first inhabitants were Indians, with whose descendants a great\r\nmany Portuguese are now intermixed. Those Indians are celebrated for\r\nmaking mats; a contiguous piece of ground supplying them with abundant\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nAbout four miles to the eastward, is the parish of St. Joao\r\nd’Itaborahy, in a situation something elevated, with a fine aspect, and\r\nnear the right bank of the river Vargé, which here takes the name of\r\nthis parish, more commonly designated by the appellation of Tapacora.\r\nMandioca, feijao, and sugar, are the principal productions, besides a\r\nsmall portion of rice, Indian-corn, and coffee.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Our Lady of Conceiçao[15] is six leagues east from\r\nMacacu, approximating the left margin of the small river Bonito; and\r\nthe inhabitants are farmers of mandioca, feijao, Indian corn, sugar,\r\nand some rice.\r\n\r\nTwo leagues to the north-east of Macacu, betwixt the two small rivers\r\nof Pinto and Entulho, is situated the parish of Santissima Trinidade,\r\n(Holy Trinity,) in a fertile country, the productions of which are,\r\nnotwithstanding, confined to the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Tamby occupies an open country, near the left bank of\r\nthe river Aldeia, about two miles south of Macacu, with a church\r\nof Our Lady of Desterro. About a mile to the east of the parish of\r\nTamby, and within its district, is situated the port of Caixas, with a\r\nhermitage of Our Lady of Conceiçao, upon the right bank of the Aldeia\r\nnot far from its confluence with the Macacu. This is the grand point\r\nfrom whence all the productions of the district of Tapacora, and the\r\nsurrounding parishes, are embarked in boats for the capital, and more\r\nsugar is sent from hence than from all the other ports in the bay.\r\n\r\nAbout two leagues to the south-east of Villa Nova, and not far from\r\nthe bay, is the parish of St. Gonçalo d’Amarante, on the right bank of\r\nthe small river of that name. Its dwellers produce a large quantity of\r\nfarinha, feijao, and Indian corn, with the superabundance of which, as\r\nwell as that of coffee, sugar, and casaçha, much specie is introduced\r\ninto the district.\r\n\r\nMage, a middling town, with the title of countship, and in an agreeable\r\nsituation upon the left bank of the river from which it derives its\r\nname, has some commerce, and a handsome parish-church of Our Lady of\r\nPiedade. It is about three leagues west of Macacu and one from the bay;\r\nand the river, which has here a wooden bridge, supplies the town with\r\nfish. In boats and craft of considerable burden, a large quantity of\r\nfarinha, Indian corn, feijao, some sugar, rice, and a little coffee,\r\nare from thence exported. This place was erected into a town in the\r\nyear 1789. An English gentleman has a country house near Mage, where\r\nparties occasionally go for the purpose of shooting, particularly\r\nsnipes, which abound in the neighbouring morasses.\r\n\r\nFour miles to the north-east of Mage, near the right bank of the river\r\nGuapymirim, is the parish of Ajuda, the soil of which is remarkably\r\nfertile, the inhabitants preferring the culture of mandioca, rice, and\r\ncoffee, to the sugar-cane: they also export a great deal of wood.\r\n\r\nTwo leagues to the west of Mage, is the parish of St. Nicolau, upon the\r\nright margin of the Suruhy, consisting of a mountainous district of ten\r\nmiles from north to south, and three in width, being partly planted\r\nwith mandioca, rice, and coffee, but principally with the banana\r\nfruit, which introduces annually seventy thousand crusades, arising,\r\nit is said, from the industry of the whites, who exceed the number of\r\nnegroes, but more likely from the properties of the soil and climate.\r\n\r\nOne league to the south-east of the port of Estrella is situated the\r\nparish of Our Lady of Guia, upon the borders of the bay, near the mouth\r\nof the small river of Pacobahyba, from whence are embarked various\r\nnecessaries of life, its principal productions.\r\n\r\nAbout four miles to the north-east of the port of Estrella is the\r\nparish of Our Lady of Piedade d’Inhumirim, situated at the angle of the\r\nconfluence of the river of that name with the small river Cruz. Its\r\nparishioners are farmers of Indian corn and mandioca, which prosper\r\nabundantly. In this district is situated Mandioca estate, belonging\r\nto G. Langsdorff, Esq. the Russian consul-general, a delightful\r\nsituation, and which he became possessed of in consequence of his\r\npursuits as a naturalist leading him frequently into that part of\r\nthe country. To accommodate a person, from whom he had received some\r\ncivilities, with a certain portion of land to form a _rancho_, for\r\nthe accommodation of mules and their drivers coming from the mines, he\r\nwas induced to purchase the whole tract of land, in the possession of\r\none individual, without any fine, and, from its peculiar adaptation\r\nto the produce of mandioca, he gave it that name. He paid under one\r\nthousand pounds for it, and its extent, which is estimated at ten\r\nsquare miles, he has not yet explored. He has already planted twenty\r\nthousand coffee-trees upon it, and the produce of mandioca in 1819\r\nyielded near one thousand sacks of farinha, worth from eight to ten\r\nshillings per sack. The King has granted him the important privilege of\r\nallowing the neighbouring people, working upon his estate, an exemption\r\nfrom the militia duty, which, of course, induces a great many to offer\r\ntheir services upon moderate terms; so that, with the addition of about\r\nsixty slaves working upon it, the property is rapidly improving. He is\r\nbuilding a house upon the estate. Mr. Langsdorff is respectably known\r\nto the literary world by the publication of his voyages. His pursuit in\r\nthe obtainment of objects in natural history has been indefatigable,\r\nand in butterflies alone he has accumulated sixteen hundred different\r\nkinds.[16]\r\n\r\nSome leagues from hence, upon the track leading to the mining\r\ndistricts, is situated the extensive establishment of Padre Corre,\r\nfor shoeing mules, previously to their proceeding into the interior\r\ndistricts. In this trade the padre has accumulated a considerable sum:\r\nhe grows a prodigious quantity of the finest peaches, and has the\r\ncharacter of being exceedingly hospitable to strangers.\r\n\r\nA league to the south-east of the port of Estrella is situated the\r\nparish of Our Lady of Pilar, upon the left bank of the river from\r\nwhich it derives its name, producing mandioca, Indian corn, rice, and\r\nvegetables, for which the soil is well adapted.\r\n\r\nSt. Maria of Marica was created a town by a law of the 26th May,\r\n1814, with a civil jurisdiction, administered by two ordinary judges,\r\n(_juizes ordinarios_,) one of orphans, three magistrates,\r\n(_vereadores_,) an alcayde, a procurator of council, and two\r\n_almotaces_, or regulators of the market. It is small, but well\r\nsituated, near the mouth of the little river Itapitiu, upon the margin\r\nof the lake from which it is named, and which well supplies it with\r\nfish. The church here, of Our Lady of Amparo, is the best in the\r\nprovince, with the exception of some in the metropolis, from whence it\r\nis distant about twenty-five miles to the eastward, and near thirty\r\nwest of Cape Frio. The inhabitants cultivate sugar, mandioca, feijao,\r\nIndian corn, and some coffee.\r\n\r\nThe district of Cape Frio, named from the promontory where the coast\r\nchanges its direction, is limited on the north, by the river Maccahé,\r\nwhich separates it from the district of Goytacazes, is washed on the\r\neast and south by the ocean, and comprises twelve leagues of territory,\r\nfrom north to south, and ten in the widest part from east to west.\r\nThe country is generally uneven, and the valleys and plains, situated\r\nbetween mountains more or less elevated, are extremely deficient in\r\ngood water. It produces mandioca, Indian corn, rice, vegetables, and\r\nsugar. Cattle, inconsiderable in number, are of a small size. Banana\r\nand orange trees, so abundant in various parts of the province, are\r\nhere exceedingly rare, owing to the negligence of the inhabitants.\r\nThe produce of indigo, which was formerly considerable, is at present\r\ntrifling, although this district is well adapted for it. Cochineal was\r\nonce an important branch of commerce; but the avaricious propensity of\r\nseveral individuals induced them to adulterate it by the addition of\r\nfarinha. The government took a certain quantity of it, and paid the\r\nbest price: but, discovering the fraud, declined having any more of\r\nit. The merchants of the capital followed this example, and at last\r\nthe cultivation of it was totally abandoned. To the productions of\r\nthe district already mentioned must be added, that of timber, which,\r\nwith management and industry, would form one of the most lucrative and\r\nimportant. The woods are very extensive, abounding in an innumerable\r\nvariety of trees, well adapted for the purposes of building, cabinet\r\nwork, &c. Three qualities of the Brazil wood are met with here, of\r\nwhich that denominated _mirim_ is esteemed the best. The rivers\r\nSt. Joao and Maccahé afford navigation for conveying those fine timbers\r\nto the coast. Besides the two last-mentioned rivers, there is the Una,\r\nwhich enters the ocean seven miles south of the first. In front of its\r\nembouchure is situated the small island of Branca.\r\n\r\nThe principal lakes in this district are the Araruama and the\r\nSequarema; the first, twenty miles long, and eight at the widest part,\r\nis separated from the ocean by a bank in many parts of small elevation,\r\nand empties itself at the eastern extremity, by a channel, which at the\r\nmouth is fifty yards in width. Notwithstanding its waters are supplied\r\nby various rivers, they have a saline flavour, in consequence of its\r\ncommunication with the sea. It abounds with a variety of fish, and in\r\nsome situations is many fathoms in depth, in others quite shallow.\r\nVarious small bays on the southern side are formed by headlands, in\r\nwhich the operations of nature furnish considerable quantities of\r\nsalt, almost without human aid. Nine places may be reckoned which\r\nare apparently destined by Providence for the production of this\r\nindispensable article; the whole is not however formed by the sea\r\nwater, but by the aqueous flow of rain through the saltpetre or saline\r\nparticles with which the earth is impregnated, subsequently acquiring\r\nthe consistency of marine water, and which arrives at its ultimate\r\ncrystalization, by the influential rays of the sun. The largest of the\r\nrivers which the lake Araruama receives are the Francisco Leite, which\r\nenters it at the western extremity, and the Mataruna, which is crossed\r\nby a bridge, and disembogues about four miles to the east of the other;\r\nbetween those streams, and at a short distance from the lake, is\r\nsituated the parish of St. Sebastian, whose inhabitants are cultivators\r\nof mandioca, rice, feijao, a little sugar, and derive some profit from\r\nfishing.\r\n\r\nThe lake Sequarema, in the vicinity of Ponta Negra, is six miles long\r\nfrom east to west, and three at the widest part; the water is salt,\r\nabounding with fish, and separated from the sea by a narrow tract of\r\nland. During the rainy season, when it inundates the adjacent country,\r\nin consequence of the superabundance of waters brought by the small\r\nstreams, the dwellers near it open a channel to the ocean from its\r\neastern extremity, which is soon filled up again, on the return of dry\r\nweather, by the flowing of the sea. The river Tinguy, which runs into\r\nits most northern bay, is the principal one that it receives. Upon the\r\nneck of land which divides it from the ocean, a parish has originated,\r\ncalled Our Lady of Nazareth, whose parishioners grow Indian corn,\r\nmandioca, and feijao, and are fishermen, which occupation constitutes\r\ntheir chief gain.\r\n\r\nBetween the lake Sequarema, and the Cururupina, is situated the Jacuné,\r\nwhich is near three miles in length, and of proportionable width.\r\n\r\nThe lake Jacarépua lies between the Sequarema and Araruama, comprising\r\ntwo miles of length, and something less in width. The lake Vermelha,\r\nabout the same size, is near the western extremity of the Araruama, and\r\nalthough it has no communication with the sea, its waters are saline.\r\n\r\nThe lake Boacica, situated two leagues to the south of the river\r\nMaccahé, and approximating the ocean, is about three miles long, and\r\nhalf a mile at the greatest width, has not much depth, is impregnated\r\nwith salt, and abounds with fish, which enter it from the sea by the\r\nchannel formed for the egress of its waters at the period of the\r\nfloods. It is the receptacle of the river from which it derives its\r\nname; also, of the Serraria, the Mutum, the Riacho d’Alagoa, and the\r\nRiachinho.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Juthurnuahibi, two miles in diameter, and one to seven\r\nfathoms in depth, receives the rivers Bucasca and Capibary; has an\r\noutlet into the ocean, which is winding, deep, navigable, and taking\r\nthe name of the first river, is seven leagues distant, and only three\r\nin a direct line from the lake.\r\n\r\nCape Frio, called a city, although not so large as a moderate town,\r\nis divided into two parts, by an interval of half a mile, both being\r\nwithout regularity, and situated upon the southern margin of the\r\neastern extremity of the lake Araruama. The principal portion has\r\na church of Our Lady of Assumption, a hermitage of St. Bento, and\r\na Franciscan monastery. The chapel of Our Lady of Cuia crowns the\r\nsummit of a rock, from whence is beheld a great extent of sea and\r\nland. The smaller portion of the city, denominated Passagem, defended\r\nby the fort of St. Mattheus, has another hermitage of St. Benedicto.\r\nThis city has royal masters of the primitive letters and Latin. The\r\ninhabitants eagerly follow the pursuit of fishing, their principal and\r\nmost lucrative occupation; fish being their common diet and their chief\r\nexportation. It was taken in the year 1615, when Portugal was under\r\nthe dominion of Philip II.; and when, like many other places, it took\r\nthe title of city, upon the occasion of some Rotterdam pirates being\r\nrepulsed, who wished to establish themselves there, for the purpose of\r\nexporting dye-wood. Here is a Juiz de Fora, whose power extends to the\r\ntown of Maccahé. Fevers are the prevailing disease of the country.\r\n\r\nSt. Joam de Maccahé, situated upon both banks of the river from which\r\nit takes its name, was created a town in 1814, and has a church called\r\nSanta Anna. The inhabitants, who are fishermen, produce some Indian\r\ncorn, rice, feijao, mandioca, and sugar, but their principal object of\r\ntrade is timber. The parish of St. Joam, at the embouchure of the river\r\nof the same name, is well situated to render it in time a considerable\r\ntown. Timber forms the riches of its inhabitants, who also export a\r\nvariety of the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nThe district of Goytacazes, comprising twenty-eight leagues of\r\ncoast, bounded on the south by the river Maccahé, and on the north\r\nby the Cabapuana, originally formed the capitania of St. Thomé, and\r\nso denominated from the contiguous cape. Pedro de Goes, who had\r\nfrequented the Brazil for ten years, was its first donatory; and\r\nalthough, the period of this donation is not recorded, it was most\r\nprobably about the year 1537, as the first allusion to him is in\r\nthe year 1527, when he transported some Indians from St. Vincente\r\nto Portugal. This fidalgo established himself and the colonists who\r\naccompanied him, upon the banks of the river Parahiba, where they lived\r\nin amity with the Indians two years, succeeded by five of inveterate\r\nwarfare, in which the aborigines displayed such bravery and determined\r\nresistance, particularly the Goytacazes, (the name of which tribe the\r\ndistrict retains,) that Goes was compelled to retire to the capitania\r\nof Espirito Santo, where the donatory Coutinho was already established.\r\nFrom thence he returned to Lisbon, and, in the year 1549, accompanied\r\nThomé de Souza to Bahia; but neither himself nor successors were\r\nfortunate in endeavouring to colonize the capitania of St. Thomé,\r\nwhich was in the possession of three different nations, the Puris,\r\nGuarus, and Goytacazas; the latter were the most numerous, and divided\r\ninto three hordes, the Goytaza Guassu, Goytacaza Moppy, and Goytacaza\r\nJacorito, the avowed enemies of each other. It is affirmed, that the\r\nGuarus comprised various nations, one of which, the Sacarus, still\r\nexists in the Organ Mountains.\r\n\r\nGil de Goes was its third donatory, at the time of its devolvement to\r\nthe crown. King Peter II. granted it to Viscount d’Asseca in the year\r\n1674; but, in consequence of the mal-administration of his successors\r\nproducing considerable dissatisfaction, and various revolts amongst\r\nthe colonists, King Joseph was induced, by commutation, to incorporate\r\nit with the crown lands; and Francisco de Sales, ouvidor of Espirito\r\nSanto, took possession of it, in the year 1752, in the name of his\r\nsovereign, to the great joy of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nFrom the river Parahiba, northward, a cordillera runs parallel with,\r\nand at no great distance from the coast; the intervening space,\r\ndenominated Cacimbas, is mountainous, and in parts sterile, and ill\r\nadapted to agricultural purposes. From the Parahiba to the Maccahé, the\r\nwhole country presents _campinhas_, or continued plains, with some\r\nsmall woods, called _capoes_, and is irrigated by various streams.\r\n\r\nThe soil is appropriated to the produce of cocoa, coffee, indigo, and\r\nrice; wheat might be cultivated with advantage. Mandioca grows best\r\nin the southern parts of the district, and sugar is cultivated in the\r\nproximity of the rivers Parahiba and Muriahe, to a very considerable\r\nextent. The number of sugar works in this district, in the year\r\n1801, amounted to two hundred and eighty, of which ninety were very\r\nlarge. Since that period they have increased rapidly, and the sugars\r\nproduced upon the margins of those rivers are esteemed the best in\r\nthe Brazil, usually known by the denomination of Campos sugars. Indian\r\ncorn, feijao, mandioca flour, tobacco, and cotton, are produced only\r\nin sufficient quantity for the consumption of the district. All the\r\nspecies of domestic animals are bred, none of them, however, are\r\nremarkable for their fecundity. Cattle are not in sufficient number\r\nfor the consumption of the population, and the working of sugar\r\n_engenhos_. The mules are not so large as those of Rio Grande,\r\nand Curitiba, but are superior in strength. Goats and sheep degenerate\r\nhere. Hogs are not numerous, neither is the pork good. The north and\r\nsouth-west winds generally prevail, and scarcely a day passes, that\r\nthe atmosphere is not refreshed with a strong breeze from one of these\r\nquarters. Part of the timber exported by the river Maccahé, is derived\r\nfrom the woods of this district, which afford a variety of medicinal\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND LAKES.--We have already described the Parahiba,\r\nwhich is the chief river of this district, and traverses it from west\r\nto east.\r\n\r\nThe river Muriahe, to which is attributed forty miles of course in a\r\ndirect line, rises in the serra of Pico, in the territory of the Puri\r\nIndians, takes a winding direction to the south-east, until it enters\r\nthe Parahiba, is navigable for the space of twenty-five miles, and has\r\na fall, where the canoes are dragged over land. When the cultivation\r\nof its fertile margins first commenced, (at this day abounding with\r\nsugar-works,) its waters were so pestilential, that many who drank\r\nof them were attacked with malignant fevers, which either terminated\r\ntheir days, or left them through life pallid and diseased. Even the\r\nnecessaries of life, which grew upon the lands inundated by its floods,\r\nwere pestiferous. Its largest confluent is denominated the Rio Morto,\r\nor Dead River, in consequence of having a very tranquil current, the\r\nwaters of which, are muddy, from its origin in a morass. The margins\r\nof the Muriahe produce a poisonous _cipo_ plant, with long and\r\nflexible shoots, called _timbo_, or _tingui_, and a tree\r\ndenominated _guaratimbo_, the infectious qualities of which are\r\nattributed to the malignancy of its waters.\r\n\r\nThe river Maccabu originates in the skirt of the Serra Salvador, little\r\nremoved from the source of the before-mentioned river St. Pedro. It is\r\nserpentine, tranquil, flows principally through a swampy country to the\r\nnorth-east, discharges itself into the lake Feia, and is navigable,\r\nwithout falls, pretty nearly to its origin.\r\n\r\nThe river Imbe, which rises at the base of the above serra, seven\r\nmiles from the head of the Maccabu, and runs for a considerable space\r\nparallel with it, receives near its commencement, by the left bank,\r\nthree streams, called the Three Rivers of the North, (which have their\r\norigin in the situation of Tres Picos, where there is gold,) and\r\ntraverses the lake of Cima, from whence it flows to the lake Feia, with\r\nthe name of Ururahi. The bed is winding and the current slow. Large\r\ncanoes advance up without obstacle, almost to its heads.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned Ururahi, (the outlet to the lake of Cima,) the\r\nmargins of which abound with plantations of the sugar-cane and\r\nmandioca, describes a semicircle to the north, approaching the\r\nParahiba, with which an advantageous communication might be opened, by\r\ncutting a canal across a plain, not exceeding four miles in width.\r\n\r\nThe lake Feia consists of two unequal parts, united by a narrow\r\nchannel. The one lies to the north, near twenty miles in length from\r\neast to west, and upwards of twelve in width; the other to the south,\r\nsixteen miles in length, and only two in width. It is an interesting\r\nlake, abounds with fish, and so inconsiderable in depth, that canoes\r\ncan only proceed by certain channels. The water is fresh and wholesome.\r\nIt has within its precincts a considerable peninsula, upon the isthmus\r\nof which is situated the church of the parish of the Lady of Remedios,\r\nand presenting a delightful aspect. The margins of this lake are\r\nmarshy, and it discharges itself by various channels, which, describing\r\nextensive circuits, form many islands, and without which, none of\r\nthose channels would have made their way to the ocean, in consequence\r\nof an extensive, high, and solid sand-bank, formed by the sea. All\r\nthe channels re-unite at divers points, and form another lake, many\r\nleagues in length, with the width of a spacious river, stretching, for\r\nits whole extent, along the said sand-bank; across a certain part of\r\nwhich it opens annually an outlet, that presents the appearance of a\r\nconsiderable and furious river, called Furado, at the time the internal\r\nreceptacles are overflown. The southern or principal of these channels\r\nis called Iguassu, or the river Castanheta. This district might be\r\ncleared from water, by the introduction of some hydraulic machines,\r\n(as in some parts of Lincolnshire), when the grounds would afford\r\npasturage, and become susceptible of cultivation at all times.\r\n\r\nThree leagues to the north of the river Maccahé, is situated the lake\r\nCarapebas, about four miles in length from east to west, of unequal and\r\ninconsiderable width, separated from the ocean by a sand-bank, which\r\nit breaks down in the rainy season, in some parts, for the egress of\r\nthe waters. It is well stored with a variety of fish. Near the right\r\nmargin of the Parahiba, between the towns of St. Salvador, and St.\r\nJoam, are the two Jahi lakes; also the Sequarema; the Campelo, upon the\r\nnorth side of the Parahiba, almost in front of the town of St. Joam;\r\nand the Pedras, which is a deep lake, having its channel of discharge\r\ndenominated the Corrego do Jacare, between the town of St. Salvador and\r\nthe mouth of the river Muriahe. Lake Cima is five miles long, and more\r\nthan sixteen hundred fathoms at its greatest width, comprehending the\r\ngulf called Pernambuca.\r\n\r\nThe fine campos, or plains, of this district would certainly become the\r\nElysium of Brazil, if its territory, rich in soil, were divided into\r\ncertain portions and delivered to a people animated with a spirit of\r\nagricultural improvement. But the same unfortunate circumstances which\r\nwe have previously described to exist in the donation of lands, concur,\r\nunhappily, to place those campos, at least the greater part, in the\r\nhands of three proprietors; namely, the Benedictine monastery of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, the purchaser of the ex-Jesuitical possessions, and a titular.\r\n\r\nSt. Salvador, or Campos, is a large, populous, and flourishing town,\r\nsituated upon a plain on the right margin of the Parahiba, eighteen\r\nmiles distant from the ocean, and four below the mouth of the Muriahe.\r\nBesides the mother church, it has a house of misericordia, three\r\nhermitages dedicated to the Lady of Rosario, Boa Morte, and Lapa;\r\nalso two Terceira orders of St. Francisco and Carmo, and a hospital.\r\nThe youth of this place are instructed by persons having the usual\r\nhigh sounding titles of royal professors of the primitive letters and\r\nLatin. Justice is administered by a head magistrate, denominated a\r\nJuiz de Fora,[17] (a judge without.) An account recently taken of the\r\npopulation of this town states it to contain eleven hundred and fifty\r\nfamilies, which may be fairly computed to comprise twelve thousand\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Joam da Parahiba derives the name from its church and\r\nthe river upon which it is situated, and is distant about two miles\r\nfrom the sea, in front of the extremity of a small island. Sugar\r\nconstitutes the riches of its inhabitants, who do not exceed fifteen\r\nhundred; and it is the port from whence the principal produce of the\r\nCampos, consisting of that article, is shipped in coasting vessels to\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nEight miles up the Maccahé is situated the parish of the Lady of Neves,\r\nwhich originated in an establishment of a tribe of Garulho Indians, but\r\nnow almost extinct, and succeeded by whites, who fell timber and are\r\nfarmers of the same necessaries of life as their predecessors.\r\n\r\nUpon the Parahiba, between the town of St. Salvador and the mouth of\r\nthe river Muriahe, the parish of St. Antonio occupies a delightful\r\nsituation. It was founded for the habitation of a horde of Indian\r\nGarulhos, who have insensibly disappeared. Its district is extensive,\r\nand abounds with sugar-works.\r\n\r\nThirty miles above the town of St. Salvador, and two below the\r\nlast fall of the Parahiba, the aldeia or village of St. Fidelis,\r\nis agreeably and secludedly situated. It is an Indian parish, and\r\nwas founded by three padres, one of whom, two years ago, was still\r\nliving, and had the whole management of this establishment. A French\r\ngentleman, who was shipwrecked at the mouth of the Parahiba, proceeded\r\nthrough the Campos as far as this Indian village. He informed me,\r\nthat, on leaving the plains cultivated with the plantations of the\r\nsugar-cane, he had to traverse a thick wood, rendered more difficult\r\nto penetrate by the wild grass and almost impervious underwood at the\r\nbottom of the higher trees. After a laborious march of five hours,\r\nthis gentleman reached the aldeia, which consisted of a stone church,\r\ndecorated with saints and much finery. It was fronted by the padre’s\r\nhouse at no great distance; both sides of this space were occupied by\r\nthe huts of the Indians, over whom, from the imposing show of religious\r\nceremony, and occasional personal chastisement, the padre had acquired\r\na perfect command. Part of the Indians were employed in his house\r\nfor domestic purposes; others in the cultivation of the necessaries\r\nof life; some were occupied in fishing in the Parahiba; and others,\r\nof proved fidelity, in shooting game in the surrounding woods; and\r\nthus subsistence was procured for the establishment. The domestic\r\narrangement, however, of this priest was truly miserable.\r\n\r\nThe savage Indians frequently carry off by force some of their\r\nChristianized brethren, and display an inveterate antipathy to\r\ncivilization. The tribes on the northern bank of the Parahiba,\r\nbordering upon the Portuguese establishments, are considered much\r\nmore cruel than those on the southern, and have afforded various and\r\nrecent proofs of cannibalism. On some occasions they lie in ambush near\r\npathways, and, with their arrows, pierce the stranger to the heart, and\r\nfeast upon his body. A proprietor of a sugar-work was carried off about\r\nthree years ago, and devoured by them; and since that time three or\r\nfour negroes have shared the same fate. They are addicted to plunder,\r\nand commit at times great devastation amongst the sugar-plantations,\r\nadvancing in bodies of fifty or sixty from the woods, and cutting down\r\nthe canes, which they carry off to their retreats. They are great\r\ncowards; and, on those appointed to keep watch giving the alarm of the\r\napproach of a single individual, they fly precipitately. They are\r\nexceedingly alarmed at the report of a gun. Two soldiers, equipped\r\nwith jackets, stuffed with cotton and quilted, (which are almost\r\nimpenetrable to the arrows of the Indian,) and with muskets, very\r\nrecently proceeded from Villa Rica, (in Minas Geraes,) and penetrated\r\nas far as this district, through the woods covering the fertile\r\nterritory on both banks of the Parahiba, to the possession of which the\r\nounce assumes a right as well as the savage.\r\n\r\nOf the ancient tribes the Puris is the principal one now remaining\r\nin those uncleared regions. It is a lamentable circumstance that the\r\nBrazilian government does not adopt some effectual plan to render these\r\nextensive and fertile territories of the Parahiba subservient to the\r\nwants of civilized man. The absence of comfort in the houses of the\r\nplanters in the Goytacaze district is very conspicuous, and they have\r\nyet much to learn in the school of hospitality.\r\n\r\nSt. Gonçalo and St. Sebastiam are parishes of this district, both\r\nsituated upon the Parahiba, and a few leagues distant from the\r\nprincipal town.\r\n\r\nThe district of Canta Gallo (Singing Cock) is a territory of great\r\nfertility, and irrigated by many rivers and smaller streams, which\r\nissue from the Organ Mountains, its southern limit, and discharge\r\nthemselves into the Parahiba, which separates it from Minas Geraes on\r\nthe north. It is bounded on the east by a continuation of the Organ\r\nrange, which divides it from Goytacazes; and on the west by the river\r\nPiabanha, which separates it from Parahiba Nova. It has mines of gold,\r\nfor the working of which the first colony was established in the year\r\n1785. The _fifths_ on the gold, rendered to the crown, in the four\r\nfollowing years, were above ten thousand cruzades; and the duty upon\r\nagricultural productions amounted to eight thousand in the same period.\r\n\r\nAmongst its rivers may be remarked the Pequequera, well stored with\r\nfish and navigable for the space of twenty miles; the Rio Negro,\r\nlittle less voluminous, and navigable for an equal distance, and also\r\nabounding with fish; the Bengales; and one called Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe major part of the territory, up to the epoch of its colonization,\r\nwas under the dominion of the Coroado Indians, the remains of the\r\nancient Goytacazes, at present not numerous, and allied to the\r\nconquerors. Their houses are large, constructed of timber and earth;\r\nthey are of extraordinary length, covered with grass, or the bark of\r\ntrees, with one door only, and without a single window. One of these\r\nrudely-constructed edifices will contain fifty, sometimes eighty,\r\nand even one hundred families. Generally each house constitutes an\r\naldeia; very rarely two are met with together. Every morning, at\r\nthe break of day, on hearing the song of a species of partridge,\r\ncalled _macuco_, (which sits upon trees during the night,) they\r\nimmediately rise, and, although it rains, they go and bathe in the\r\nnearest torrent or lake; for which purpose a signal is made by the\r\nsound of an instrument formed of a cane.\r\n\r\nTheir marriage ceremonies consist of a species of banquet, at which all\r\nthe inhabitants of the aldeia assemble; and generally the whole party\r\nbecome intoxicated. Immediately on being sensible of the approach of\r\nlabour, the women retire into a wood, where they become mothers without\r\nany assistance whatever, and return with their infants, already covered\r\nwith the juice of certain herbs, to render them less susceptible of\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nThese natives inter their dead in a sitting posture. Formerly the\r\ncemeteries of their caciques, or captains, consisted of cylindrical\r\nearthen vases, denominated _cammucis_; some of which have been\r\nrecently found, containing bones.\r\n\r\nThese Indians use the bow and arrow only. The arrow is a species of\r\ncane, with a point of peculiarly hard wood, exposed to the fire till it\r\nacquires the greatest degree of consistency; some, intended for large\r\nanimals, are formed at the point like a sword; others triangular and\r\nquadrangular.\r\n\r\nA man who returns to the house after an absence of many days does not\r\nsay a single word, in compliment, to his family, nor do they receive\r\nhim in any other manner than if he had only been to fetch water from\r\nthe fountain.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 the parish of Santissimo Sacramento was created a town, with\r\nthe name of St. Pedro de Canta Gallo. Its civil government is conducted\r\nby two ordinary judges, three magistrates, and various minor officers.\r\nIt is a middling town, traversed by a current of good water, which\r\nflows to the river Macuco. Its inhabitants, and those of its extensive\r\ndistrict, prefer agriculture to mining, and they cultivate the usual\r\nnecessaries of life belonging to the country.\r\n\r\nIn this district is the parish of St. Joze de Leonissa, upon the\r\nParahiba, in front of the embouchure of the river Pomba, was created a\r\nparish in 1812, and is a _povoacāo_, abounding with fish and all\r\nthe necessaries of life. Its inhabitants are yet almost all Indians.\r\n\r\nBetween the rivers Pomba and Parahiba, about six miles distant from\r\nthe angle of their confluence, the parish of St. Antonio de Padua was\r\nerected, in 1812, in a district well adapted to the culture of various\r\nbranches of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe dwellers of the northern margin of the Parahiba are diocesans of\r\nRio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP.

It is the most southern one in the Brazil, very\r\nextensive and important, lying between twenty-eight and thirty-five\r\ndegrees of south latitude, and is bounded on the north by the province\r\nof St. Catharina (from which it is separated by the river Manbituba)\r\nand the province of St. Paulo; on the west it is skirted by the river\r\nUruguay and the province of that name; on the south by the river Plate;\r\nand on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; being upwards of five hundred\r\nmiles long and four hundred wide.\r\n\r\nThe climate is temperate, participating almost equally of heat and\r\ncold, and the air is pure and healthy. Winter begins in May and lasts\r\ntill October. The prevailing wind is from the south-east. The longest\r\nday of the year, in the most southern part of the province, is about\r\nfourteen hours, or rather more. Frost occasionally prevails from the\r\nmonth of July till September. The greatest part of this province\r\nis flat, having extensive plains, watered with numerous torrents,\r\nor rapid streams, and with lakes. No other district possesses such\r\nabundant pastures. In its southern parts the soil is well adapted to\r\na profitable diversity of productions; to wheat, rye, barley, Indian\r\ncorn, rice, peas, beans, water-melons, melons, onions, as well as to\r\nall that arises from Spanish horticulture; also, some cotton, mandioca,\r\nand the sugar-cane. Hemp and different qualities of flax grow in great\r\nabundance. Fruit-trees of the south of Europe prosper here better than\r\nbetween the tropics, and none multiply so prodigiously as the peach.\r\nThe vine flourishes in profusion and perfection; but the absence of a\r\nspirit of industry and improvement still retards the manufacture of\r\nwine, of which the grape here would afford an excellent quality.\r\n\r\nD. Peter de Mendonça, sent by Charles V. with eight hundred men, in\r\norder to form a colony in the river Plate, in 1535, established himself\r\nin the place where the city of Buenos Ayres now stands, in the country\r\nof the _Maracotos_, by whose hands he lost his life, and a great\r\npart of his followers, in 1539. The rest had, in the preceding year,\r\nadvanced up the Paraguay, and already begun the city of Assumption. D.\r\nPedro Ortez de Zarate, governor of that city, re-established the colony\r\nof Mendonça at Buenos Ayres, and took up his residence there in 1580,\r\nin order to supply the want of a port to the city of Assumption, which\r\nthey could not obtain on the opposite margin of the Plate.\r\n\r\nThe Vincentistas would not consent to any Spanish establishment on the\r\nnorthern margin of this river, from Cape St. Mary to the embouchure of\r\nthe river Paraguay, and from whence they were repulsed every time they\r\nattempted to gain a footing. The settlers from St. Paulo, in the years\r\n1536, 1538, and 1540, expelled some priests of the orders of St. Cosme,\r\nSt. Damiao, St. Anna, &c. who had settled in the land of St. Gabriel,\r\nfrom the upper to the eastern part of the river, and effectually drove\r\nthem into the province of Paraguay.\r\n\r\nIn the sixty years that Portugal was subject to the court of Castile,\r\nvarious Spanish colonies established themselves in the vicinity of\r\nthe river Uruguay; and, in order to prevent a continuation of these\r\nestablishments towards the east, D. Manuel Lobo, governor of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, founded Colonia do Sacramento, at the request of the infant\r\nDon Pedro, in 1680.\r\n\r\nScarcely had seven months elapsed, when it was surprised and taken,\r\nby Don Joze Garro, governor of Buenos Ayres, accompanied with\r\ncircumstances of much barbarity. It was restored at the end of three\r\nyears, and placed in its former state, by Duarthe Teixeira Chaves. It\r\nhowever returned under the dominion of Buenos Ayres, being abandoned\r\nby the governor, Sebastian da Veiga, in 1703, who, after a long and\r\nvalorous resistance, retired with all his people and property, in\r\nships, to Rio de Janeiro, not having sufficient forces any longer\r\nto resist the power of Don Alonso Valdez. By the treaty of Utrecht,\r\nin 1713, it was restored to the crown of Portugal, but was attacked\r\nafresh in 1735, by Don Miguel de Salcedo, governor of Buenos Ayres,\r\nand defended by Antonio Pedro, with much courage, till he could\r\nreceive aid, during which period, his brave garrison were reduced to\r\nthe necessity of eating dogs, cats, and rats. On the arrival of the\r\nexpected succour, Salcedo raised the siege, an auxiliary force of some\r\nthousand Tappes, brought by the Jesuit, Thomas Berley, availing him\r\nnothing. In 1750, when Don Joseph ascended the throne, the two courts\r\nagreed to a treaty of limits between their respective possessions, the\r\none giving up Colonia, and the other the seven missions to the east of\r\nthe Uruguay. The line of division commenced at the mouth of the little\r\nriver nearest the hill of Castilhos Grandes, and continued along the\r\nhighest range of land, in which the various rivers originate that run\r\ninto the lakes Mirim and Patos, to the source of the river Ibicuí, and\r\nalong its channel to its entrance into the Uruguay; by the latter,\r\nupwards to the mouth of the Piquiri, which joins it by the right bank,\r\nabove the great fall, and by that river to its origin; from thence,\r\nby the top of the nearest mountains, to the source of the first river\r\nmet with that runs into the river Iguacu, proceeding downwards by the\r\nlatter, to its entrance into the Parana, and continued thence to the\r\nmouth of the Gatimim, and by that river upwards to its origin; from\r\nwhich point, to the source of the nearest river that runs into the\r\nParaguay: from this confluence, continuing upwards by the last great\r\nriver to the mouth of the Jauru, and from thence by a line to the left\r\nbank of the Guapore; and by it downwards, to a latitude at an equal\r\ndistance between its confluence with the Mamore and the entrance of the\r\nMadeira into the Maranham; and from that latitude, by a line from east\r\nto west, as far as the Hyabary, the bed of which river to complete\r\nthe line as far as the Maranham. The commissioners sent by the two\r\ncourts, in 1752, to arrange this demarcation, having arrived at the\r\nsource of the Rio Negro, were obliged to return, from the opposition\r\nof the Indians of the missions, they being advised secretly by the\r\nJesuits not to consent to the proposed exchange. On learning which,\r\nthe two Sovereigns determined to compel the Indians to obedience by\r\nforce of arms. For this purpose, Gomez Freyre d’Andrade, governor of\r\nRio de Janeiro, marched with more than one thousand troops; and the\r\ngovernor of Buenos Ayres with double the number. When the combined\r\narmies were marching through the territories lying between the source\r\nof the Caziquey, and the Vaccahy-guaçu, they were met by more than\r\ntwelve thousand Tappes, determined to frustrate their project. On the\r\n10th of February, 1756, a battle took place, in which the Indians were\r\nrouted with the loss of fifteen hundred, leaving on the field some\r\npieces of artillery, and a great number of other arms, the major part\r\nretiring to the missions, where shortly after the conquerors arrived.\r\nThe Indians were immediately reduced to subjection; and, according to\r\nthe treaty, they passed over to the other side of the Paraguay. Gomez\r\nFreyre d’Andrade took possession of the country, but, before delivering\r\nup Colonia, received advices that his presence was indispensable at\r\nRio, for which place he immediately set out. The army remained some\r\nmonths behind, seizing the produce of the labour of the Indians, and\r\nat length retired, many returning to their homes. Bougainville, (say\r\nthe Portuguese,) out of revenge for not having been treated at Rio de\r\nJaneiro, by C. da Cunha, as he wished, gives a different account of\r\nthis expedition.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners, in 1759, while completing this demarcation, found in\r\nthe field of battle, in latitude 30° south, a wooden cross set upright,\r\nwith the following inscription, in the Guarani language.\r\n\r\n                             Anuo de 1756\r\nOmnium S^{to} rum        A 7        O ch^{to} Jesus^{tuo} Pa^e tie cr^e\r\n                            de Febrero pipe\r\n                            omanò C^r J. b.\r\n                            Tiarayu Guarani\r\n                           pipe Sabado ramo\r\n                                 A 10\r\n                          de Febrero p^e oico\r\n                       Guarini guaçú Martes p^e\r\n                          9 Taba Uruguay rebe\r\n                        gua 1500 Soldados rebe\r\n                       hae beiaere Mburubichare\r\n                          ta omanô onga ape.\r\n                                A 4 de\r\n                         Marzo p^e oya pou ca\r\n                          Angaco Cruz mtu D^n\r\n                          Miguel Moyri sold^e\r\n                               repa upe\r\n\r\nA little to the southward, in the plains of the Yapóguaçú, the\r\ncommissioners met with a field or space enclosed with wood capable of\r\ncontaining forty thousand oxen.\r\n\r\nThe certainty of war breaking out in 1762, having been received at\r\nBuenos Ayres, the governor, Don Pedro Cevalhos, unexpectedly ordered\r\na furious attack upon Colonia. Vincente da Fonseca, its governor,\r\nafter a vigorous resistance of twenty-five days, seeing the horrible\r\ndevastation which a prodigious discharge of artillery had caused,\r\ncapitulated, and marched out with his garrison on the 29th October. Two\r\nships of war, with other smaller vessels were sent from Rio de Janeiro,\r\nto reinforce the place; and, on finding that it had surrendered, they\r\nunavailingly endeavoured to regain it; and, in the ardour of battle,\r\none of their ships of war was burned. Cevalhos now proceeded against\r\nthe forts of St. Miguel, St. Theresa, and Rio Grande de St. Pedro,\r\nwhich surrendered in consequence of not having adequate force for\r\ntheir protection. Little care had been taken for the security of this\r\nfine country by the inhabitants. After reducing also a fortification\r\non the southern part of the peninsula, the Spaniards marched sixteen\r\nhundred men to the west of the lake of Patos, against the fort of Rio\r\nPardo. This corps fortified itself with seven pieces of artillery by\r\nthe side of a wood, in the vicinity of the pass of Jacuhy, and waited\r\nfor reinforcements. Intelligence being received of this circumstance at\r\nthe fort of Rio Pardo, a company of dragoons, with all the Paulistas\r\nthat could be assembled, making in all twelve hundred and thirty men,\r\nleft the fort with a view of cutting off the march of the Spaniards.\r\nFinding, however, that their only mode of attack was from that side\r\nof the wood which did not afford any transit for cavalry, they spent\r\nseveral days in opening a narrow pathway through it. A passage being\r\nopened, and favoured by the light of the moon, they fell unexpectedly\r\nupon the encampment, and threw it into disorder. The Spaniards retired\r\nprecipitately, with much loss in ammunition, killed, and prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe peace of 1763 put an end to the campaign. Cevalhos, in pursuance\r\nof orders he received, was to deliver Colonia to Pedro de Sarmento,\r\nnow appointed its governor. Rio Grande and other garrisons (unjustly,\r\nsay the Portuguese) remained under the dominion of the crown of Spain\r\nuntil the year 1776, when they were restored by General Bohemi. In this\r\ninterval, the Spaniards extended their possessions into the interior,\r\nand constructed the fort of St. Tecla, which was demolished at the\r\nrestoration of Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, Don John Joze Vertis, having with sinister views taken\r\nhis station with eight hundred troops, on a plain near the pass of\r\nTaquatinguay, was attacked and destroyed by two companies of Paulistas,\r\ncommanded by captains Bandeiro and Carneiro. During the tranquillity\r\nof peace, an armament, commanded by Cevalhos, for the purpose of\r\nseizing the island of St. Catharina, anchored in front of the colony,\r\nwho were unprovided with sufficient provisions, the people having been\r\nsustained by the stores of the royal magazines, which it was alleged\r\nwould only last five days. Assigning as a reason the impossibility of\r\nreceiving succours, the governor, with a probable want of courage,\r\noffered to capitulate, which offer being rejected, he surrendered at\r\ndiscretion, with the exception of some officers, their families, and\r\na few inhabitants, who, by paying a sum of money, obtained permission\r\nto go to Rio de Janeiro. The greater part of the colony were conducted\r\nat their own expense to Mendonça and Cordova, in order to augment the\r\npopulation and agriculture of those districts. Cevalhos was cruel\r\nenough not to exempt the women from this march, some of whose husbands\r\nwere sent dangerously ill to the hospital of Buenos Ayres; others were\r\nseen carrying in their arms their infants dying with the small pox.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the island of St. Catharina, then more considerable for\r\nits ultimate advantages, than for its present value, produced a treaty\r\nof peace between the two nations, in the same year, 1777, with an\r\narticle to establish a new line of division in the southern part only,\r\none surrendering the aforesaid island, the other Colonia; and in the\r\nprovince of Uruguay, a greater portion of neutral territory to remain\r\nbetween the small rivers Chuy, the ancient limit, and Thahim. The\r\ndemarcation was to proceed in a direct line by the source of the river\r\nArica, northward to the mouth of the Peperi-guaçu; and passing the\r\nSetequeades (Seven Falls) to continue up the Igurey to the Paraguay.\r\n\r\nThe certainty of war between his Catholic Majesty and Portugal,\r\nbeing received at Rio Grande St. Pedro, in June, 1801, the governor\r\nimmediately ordered a proclamation to be issued to the corps de guard,\r\nto regard the Spanish nation as enemies; and, in the expectation of an\r\norder coming from the capital to make a formal declaration, he pardoned\r\nall deserters who were willing to take up arms. An official letter now\r\narriving from his excellency the Viceroy, the campaign commenced by\r\nthe marching of troops in two bodies to the frontier of Rio Pardo and\r\nRio Grande. By the narrow land between the lake Mirim and the ocean, S.\r\nSoares and J. Antunes marched with one hundred and fifty men against\r\nthe camp of Chuy, which was surprised, sacked, and abandoned, without\r\nany loss on the part of the assailants. This corps passed to the other\r\nside of Rio de St. Gonçalo, and halted at Herval, in front of some\r\nadvanced posts established on the north of the Jaguaron, which the\r\nSpaniards abandoning, the Portuguese demolished. The same misfortune\r\nbefel all the other Spanish detachments, as far as the vicinity of\r\nthe Jacuhy, without excepting fort St. Teela. On the Spanish guards\r\nretiring towards the post of Cerro-largo, twelve leagues to the\r\nsouth of the Jaguaron, on the Batuvi, they had a re-encounter with a\r\nparty of Portuguese, who put them to flight, took six waggons with\r\nammunition, provisions, and mathematical instruments. A small party of\r\nthe Portuguese and Spaniards engaged each other on the Jaguaron, when\r\nthe former were successful, returning with fifty prisoners, having lost\r\nonly two men.\r\n\r\nShortly after, a colonel passed to the other side of the river with\r\ntwelve hundred Portuguese, and marched to the attack of the Spanish\r\nfort at Cerro-largo. Before the Portuguese had fired many guns, some\r\ncartridges of powder took fire, and a horse taking fright threw the\r\ncavalry into disorder, which spread through the whole detachment.\r\nAnimated by this event, and wishing to take advantage of it, a sortie\r\nwas made by a squadron of Spanish cavalry; but the Portuguese forming\r\nagain, they were obliged to retreat. This trifling reverse, and the\r\nsmallness of the garrison, induced the commandant to capitulate.\r\nThe Portuguese apprehending, however, the arrival of some Spanish\r\nreinforcements from Monte Video, dismantled the fort and returned to\r\ntheir former position. Shortly afterwards, the large reinforcement\r\nwhich left Monte Video in order to succour the pass of Cerro-largo,\r\narrived at the opposite banks of the river. The Portuguese showing at\r\nthe same time a resolute determination to oppose their passage. In this\r\nstate of things, the news of peace arrived and terminated the campaign.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--This province has no very considerable mountains,\r\nexcepting the cordillera called the General Serra, which runs from\r\nthe north, near the sea, and in the parallel of 29° 30′ turns to the\r\nwest, and then north-west with some windings, breaking in many parts to\r\nafford a passage to various rivers, amongst others, the Paranna. The\r\nmountain of St. Martinho, or Monte Grande, is a portion of that serra,\r\nwhere it divides this province from that of Uruguay. Monte Vidio, or\r\nVideo, situated on the west side of the bay to which it gives the name,\r\nis pleasing to the view, and high only in the vicinity of the sea.\r\nThe Castilhos Grandes is a hill near to the point of the same name,\r\nand crowned with stones, that appear like towers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Jas. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  CAPTAIN OF MILITIA IN THE PROVINCE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL.]\r\n\r\nThe Pao d’Assucar (Sugar-Loaf) is upon the shore four or five leagues\r\nto the west of Maldonado, and the hill of St. Luzia a little to the\r\neast of the river of the same name. The Serra dos Tappes, which is\r\nof very small elevation, runs parallel with the lake of Patos at a\r\ndistance of from four to seven leagues, being fifteen leagues long from\r\nnorth to south, and five broad. That of Herval is further to the north,\r\nbehind the Tappes.\r\n\r\nThe extensive chains of small hills, without trees, and forming\r\npasturage for flocks of cattle, are called _cochilhas_.\r\n\r\nThe before-mentioned Pao d’Assucar is at the southern extremity of the\r\nchain called the Great Cochilha, which extends itself to the north as\r\nfar as the source of the river Arica. In many parts, its elevation\r\nis imperceptible, appearing like a plain, and from both sides other\r\nmountains branch off, as do some rivers which have their origin in it.\r\nThe hills ranging to the west of it are not well known; the largest on\r\nthe east are the Herval, the Piratinim, approximating the rivers of the\r\nsame names, and the Babiragua, in the vicinity of the Camacuan. The\r\nhighest points of the hills and cochilhas, and destitute of vegetation,\r\nare called _serros_, their summits serving on occasions of war for\r\nwatchtowers, which are numerous, and some of them are seen from others\r\nat a distance of twenty leagues.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The numerous streams of this province almost all\r\nissue by two channels, viz. the Rio Grande de St. Pedro, which\r\nempties itself about the middle of the eastern coast, and the Rio\r\nUruguay, which runs into the Paraguay. The Great Cochilha divides\r\nthe tributary streams of those two rivers. The Uruguay originates in\r\nthe lower parts of the mountains which stretch along the ocean, and\r\nruns for a considerable distance under the name of Pellotas to the\r\nwestward, between margins principally of pointed and massy rocks,\r\ngathering in its course the rivers Caveiras, Caroas, Chorros, and the\r\nCorrentes, which issue either from the skirts or the vicinity of the\r\nsame cordillera, and water the most southern portion of the province\r\nof St. Paulo, designated by the name of Campos da Vaccaria. It here\r\ntakes the name with which it terminates, and, already assuming the\r\nappearance of a large river, bends its course towards the south-west,\r\nstill accumulating by other streams. In latitude 29½°, it receives the\r\nconsiderable river Ibicui by the left, afterwards the Mirinay by the\r\nright, then flowing southward, and ultimately the Negro by its eastern\r\nmargin; has many windings and islands, and affords navigation for\r\nlarge boats to the first great fall, which is ten leagues below the\r\nconfluence of the Ibicui. Canoes advance as far up as the centre of\r\nthe vaccarias, or cattle-plains, not, however, without immense labour,\r\noccasioned by the many cataracts and rapid currents.\r\n\r\nThe river Ibicui rises in the plains of Japóguassu, and, after running\r\nmany leagues to the west, turns northward for a space of twenty-five\r\nleagues, augmenting considerably by the junction of many rivers, one\r\nof them being the river Caziquey; a little below which confluence the\r\nToropy joins it, which is larger, and comes from the cattle plains,\r\nflowing south-west, and bringing with it the river Ibicui-Mirim, that\r\njoins it on the left a little higher up. At this confluence, called\r\nForquilha, (Three-pronged,) where the Ibicui becomes considerable, it\r\nturns to the west, and gradually augments in importance, so that much\r\nabove its embouchure it is four hundred fathoms wide; a little below\r\nthe Forquilha it is joined on the right by the Jaguari, a considerable\r\nstream, which also comes from the before-mentioned vaccarias. Its banks\r\nare covered with wild shrubs and trees; the tortuous channel has many\r\nislands, the current almost always tranquil, and navigable nearly to\r\nthe heads of those rivers which form it.\r\n\r\nThe river Negro has its origin very near to that of the Ibicui, runs\r\nalways to the south-west, is enlarged by the receipt of a number of\r\nstreams, and incorporates itself with the Uruguay five leagues before\r\nthat river enters the Paraguay, or Plate, after having watered eighty\r\nleagues of country, abounding, for the major part, in cattle: its\r\nlargest confluent is the Hy, which it receives nearly twenty leagues\r\nabove its mouth, after a course of thirty-six leagues, from east to\r\nwest, through a country rich in pasturage and cattle.\r\n\r\nThe river St. Luzia takes a course, for nearly forty leagues, through a\r\ncountry similarly abundant, and disembogues four leagues to the west of\r\nMonte Video, having received by the right bank, a little higher up, the\r\nSt. Joze, with which it becomes wide, deep, and navigable, with a good\r\nport at its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe river Jacuhy (from the bird Jacús) is formed, on the western side\r\nof the cattle-plains, by a union of various streams, which irrigate\r\nthose campos, and from whence it issues being already considerable. A\r\nfew leagues after having traversed the General Serra it flows eastward,\r\ndescribing innumerable windings for a space of thirty leagues and on\r\na sudden turns towards the south. After a further course of fifteen\r\nmiles, having become a large river, it enters the western side of the\r\nlake Patos, about four leagues below its northern extremity. Amongst\r\nother smaller streams which swell its waters, after issuing from the\r\nserra, is the Vaccahy, which rises a few leagues to the north of the\r\nIbicuí-Guaçu, and brings with it the Vaccahy-Mirim, which has its\r\norigin a short distance from that of the Jacuhy-Mirim. These rivers\r\nwere so named after cattle began to graze near them. The gentle course\r\nof the Jacuhy is uninterrupted by cataracts, and is perfectly free to\r\nnavigation. The Irapuan receives a great many currents, almost all\r\nmuddy and brackish, and very cold. A species of soft black stone, with\r\nwhite particles like silver, are found upon many parts of its banks.\r\nOn being burnt, it emits a sulphureous smell, assumes the appearance\r\nof charcoal, and is said to be of no higher value. The Butucarai\r\ncomes from the north, and has a bridge. Near its mouth is the passage\r\nof Fandango. The Pigueri joins the Irohy, and comes from the Serro\r\nPellado da Encruzilhada. The Tubatingahy originates between a serro\r\nand the Encruzilhada. The Pardo, having its source in a serra, runs\r\nthrough a country covered with wild woods; the large stones in its bed\r\npreclude navigation: it is passed by a bridge. The Capibari flows from\r\nthe vicinity of the source of the Irohy. The Antos, formed by various\r\ncurrents, which issue from the lower part of the cordillera, after a\r\nconsiderable course towards the west, turns to the south, receives the\r\nTibicoari, and, ten leagues farther, under the latter name, enters\r\nthe Jacuhy, of which it is the largest tributary, affording an open\r\nnavigation to yachts as far as the confluence, where it loses the first\r\nname. The adjacent country is fertile, producing beautiful pine and\r\nother trees of excellent timber. The Jacuhy, (ten leagues below the\r\nJacoari,) at the part where on a sudden it turns to the south, is two\r\nmiles in width, forming a bay, where it receives the Cahy, which issues\r\nfrom the plains on the summit of the General Serra, with a course of\r\nabout twenty-five leagues, almost south, and affording a navigation\r\nto yachts of ten leagues. The Sino, something smaller, which rises on\r\nthe top of the same serra, more to the south, runs south-west, and\r\nis navigable for a considerable distance. The Gravatahy, which has\r\nits origin in the same hills, further to the south, runs in the same\r\ndirection, and affords navigation for a space of five leagues.\r\n\r\nThe rivers Igarupay, Daymar, and Gualeguay, are the principal ones\r\nwhich enter the Uruguay, by the left bank, between the mouths of the\r\nIbicuí and the Negro.\r\n\r\nThe Maldonado, and the two rivers Solis, (small and great,) discharge\r\nthemselves into the gulf of the river Plate. Rio Grande de St. Pedro\r\nis the name of the outlet of the lake of Patos, and is about ten miles\r\nin length almost north and south, near one league in width, and is\r\nsituated sixty leagues north-east from Cape St. Mary. The lateral\r\nlands are very flat, and destitute of trees or buildings to direct the\r\nnavigator, who, at a distance only of two leagues, with clear weather,\r\ncan but just distinguish the entrance to the port in 32° 4′, where the\r\nebbing and flowing of the water generally produce an agitated sea,\r\nrendering the shoals variable, so that no ship can or should enter the\r\nport without a well experienced person, acquainted with the state of\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Patos, which took its name from a nation of Indians now\r\nunknown, is the largest in the Brazil, being one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles in length from north-east to south-west, parallel with the\r\ncoast, and thirty-five at its greatest width, with sufficient depth\r\nfor vessels of a middling size; it has, however, some very dangerous\r\nshoals. The water is salt in the southern part, with the banks\r\ngenerally flat. It is the recipient of almost all the currents which\r\nwater the northern and eastern portion of the province, and whose\r\nprincipal embouchures are the Jacuhy on the north, and the river de\r\nSt. Gonçalo on the south. The lake Mirim, which signifies “small,”\r\ncompared with the other, is ninety miles in length, and twenty-five at\r\nits greatest width; this also extends along the coast, and discharges\r\ninto the lake Patos, by a channel, fifty miles long, wide, handsome,\r\nand navigable, and constituting the aforesaid river de St. Gonçalo.\r\nThe river Saboyaty, after having collected many others, flows, in a\r\nconsiderable stream, into the southern extremity of the lake Mirim,\r\nand is navigable for many leagues. The small river Chuy disembogues\r\nalmost in the middle of the same lake; and, further to the north,\r\nthe river Jaguaron, which has its source near the lake Formoza,\r\n(beautiful.) It has a course of about eighty miles, and eighteen of\r\nnavigation. The river Piratirim which has its origin also near the\r\nlake Formoza, empties itself about the middle of the St. Gonçalo,\r\nafter a course of thirty leagues, affording ten miles of navigation.\r\nThe river Pellotas, rising in the serra of the Tappes, enters the\r\nSt. Gonçalo near its mouth, and admits of small vessels for five\r\nleagues. Passing the embouchure of the St. Gonçalo, the first river\r\nmet with on the lake Patos is the Contagem, which is about fourteen\r\nleagues in extent. The second is the Correntes. The third is the\r\nCanguçu, navigable for some leagues. The fourth runs under the name\r\nof St. Lourenço. The fifth denominated Boqueirao, and the least of\r\nall, originates, like the others, in the Serra dos Tappes. Above the\r\nBoqueirao, in the middle of the lake of Patos, the Camapuan empties\r\nitself by five mouths, formed by four islands, the largest of which is\r\nhalf a league in circumference. It flows from the Great Cochilha by a\r\nrapid course of nearly one hundred miles, amongst rocks and stones,\r\nadmitting navigation only for a distance of four leagues, and higher\r\nup presenting continued cataracts. By its southern margin fourteen\r\ncurrents are admitted, some of them ten leagues in extent; and fifteen\r\nby its northern bank, none exceeding five leagues. The southern ones,\r\ncommencing from the mouth of the river, are the Pereira, rising in the\r\nSerra dos Tappes; the Cardozo; the Evaristo; the Meirelles; the Sapata,\r\nwhich flows from the same serra; the small river Pedras, (Stones,)\r\nrising near the situation called Igatimi; the Almeida; the Arroio\r\nGrande; the Velhaco, originating in the Grand Cochilha, near the Serro\r\nBay, and running through a bed consisting in parts of rugged and craggy\r\nprominences; the Fagundes, which runs for five leagues between rocks,\r\nwith many falls; the Rodrigues, rolling angrily over precipices, and\r\nfoaming between rocks and stones; the Arroio da Palma, considerable,\r\nserene, well stored with fish, and navigable for small craft; (the\r\nquadruped _capibara_ is seen upon its banks in bands of eighty\r\nand one hundred;) and the Camapuan Chici, tranquil in its course,\r\nreceiving, amongst other streams, one called Tigre. The adjacent\r\nterritory consists of fine campos, fertile in corn.\r\n\r\nPassing the mouth of the Camapuan, northward, the Duro is first met\r\nwith, which runs through a flat open country, without wood, and forms\r\nin its course some lakes. Next, the Velhaco, flowing rapidly through\r\nwoods. Beyond this is the Passo Grande, with like umbrageous borders.\r\n\r\nProceeding up by the Jacuhy to the town of Portalegre, on the left bank\r\nis the Araca, rising in the Serra Herval, and the Antonio Alves, which,\r\nthree leagues above its mouth, receives the Doudarilho, and affords an\r\nopen navigation to _hyates_, or yachts. At the northern extremity\r\nof the lake Patos the river Palmares enters, having its source in the\r\nneighbouring plains of the Tramandahy. Three leagues to the west of it\r\nruns the Capibara, which is only a current in winter, when the lake of\r\nSerra, receiving the waters of various small brooks, discharges them\r\nthrough this outlet: the lake is about eighteen miles long and five\r\nwide, and runs parallel with the cordillera. The country which these\r\nrivers traverse is a plain of white sand, and in great part marshy,\r\nproducing, however, some herbage, brushwood, and plantations.\r\n\r\nAlong the coast, which runs from Cape St. Mary to the little Castilhos,\r\nare various lakes approximating to the sea. The lake Manglieira, which\r\nis eighty miles long and about four broad, extends between the coast\r\nand the lake Mirim, and empties itself, at the northern extremity, by\r\nan outlet called Arroio Thahim. The peninsula between the coast and the\r\nlake of Patos, from two to six leagues in width, is interspersed with\r\na great number of lakes, generally running into the ocean, or into\r\nothers. Amongst those extending westward we may remark, in the southern\r\npart, the Capibaras, into which a small river empties itself of limpid\r\nwater, bursting suddenly forth with admirable force, and is the purest\r\nin the peninsula, which, nevertheless, is not deficient in good potable\r\nwaters. On the eastern side of the peninsula is the lake Mostardas,\r\nbetter known by the name of Peixe, nine leagues long, with little\r\nwidth, extending along the margin of the sea to the point where it\r\ndisembogues through an elbow of land, that opens and closes annually,\r\nand by which various species of fish enter; the most numerous are\r\ndenominated _miragarga_, resembling the cod-fish. With this lake\r\nvarious others communicate, that lie to the north, and are connected by\r\ntheir different mouths. Near the last, that terminates the extent of\r\nthe Barros Vermelhos, another chain of a similar description commences,\r\nat a short distance from the beach, and extends parallel with it for a\r\nspace of twenty-five leagues.\r\n\r\nA short way from Barros Vermelhos, and by the side of the sea, there\r\nis a small lake that runs into a larger one, which terminates in the\r\nCapoes do Retuvado. It has an outlet into another, that extends from\r\nhence a league and a half. Beyond these there are two lakes running\r\nparallel; and still further another, near the Capao do Xavier, a\r\ndistance of two leagues, which discharges itself into the lake\r\nCharqueada, the latter terminating in the place of that name, and\r\nrunning by a vein into a smaller one: this empties itself into a lake\r\nof equal size, and that is joined to a larger, which terminates in\r\nthe Capao Dastacoáras. The last discharges itself into the Quintao,\r\nwhich runs into the Cidreira. The Cidreira is divided into three bays\r\nor lakes, communicating by necks or outlets, and occupying an extent\r\nof four leagues and a half. It has a channel of two miles long to the\r\nRibeiro, terminating near the passage of the Arroio, its outlet to the\r\nriver Tramandahy. The river Tramandahy is in 30° south latitude, and is\r\nnothing more than the channel of discharge to a great number of lakes,\r\nspreading themselves over the extensive plains that lie between the\r\nbeach and the cordillera. Into this river also is discharged the most\r\nsouthern of another chain of lakes, that extend themselves along the\r\nsame cordillera northward, very near to the river Mombituba, at the\r\nmouth of which there is a military detachment, in order to register\r\npersons entering or leaving the province. In the space of twelve\r\nleagues, which lie between the Tramandahy and the Mombituba, fourteen\r\nsmall rivers of crystalline water are discharged into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe afore-mentioned peninsula, formed by the lake Patos and the ocean,\r\nis level ground, with a small elevation, or albardao, near the middle;\r\nit is almost in a direct line on the eastern side, forming various\r\npoints and bays on the opposite one. Among the first is the Ponta do\r\nMandanha, commencing at the south, where have been found the vestiges\r\nof an Indian village and cemetery. Next to this the Ponta Raza; between\r\nthem the lake das Capibaras discharges itself. In the middle of the\r\nbay called Barrancas, which is the best shelter in this lake for all\r\nvessels, some small rivers are emptied, one of which is navigated by\r\ncanoes and other boats. The Ponta of Bujurú is six leagues more to the\r\nnorth. Into the middle of a bay of the same name, runs a fine river,\r\nwhich forms a little island at the bar. The point of Christovam Pereira\r\nis six leagues further. In the bay, which is to the southward of it,\r\nthere are two considerable mountains of shells, which prove how much\r\nthe Indians were attached to shell-fish. The point and bay of Cacira\r\nare more to the north, and the last that are remarkable. The ground is\r\ngenerally of a very sandy soil, but in some parts clay is found below\r\nthe sand, which shows that the peninsula is not formed by the sand of\r\nthe sea, but that the ancient soil is covered with it. Between the\r\nlakes Mirim and Mangueira, for many leagues, the small river Chuy takes\r\nits course, and enters the ocean in front of the southern extremity of\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nCAPES, PORTS, AND ISLANDS.--St. Mary is the only cape. Monte\r\nVideo, St. Luzia, and Maldonado are the best ports. The islands of\r\nCastilhos, near the point of the same name, and Maldonado, in the\r\nentrance of the bay of the same name, are both small. The isle of\r\nLobos, (Wolves,) two miles in circumference, has good water, is almost\r\nall rocks and stones, and lies four leagues to the south-east of the\r\npreceding one. There are two others to the south-west of Cape St. Mary.\r\nThe isle das Flores, half a league long, and of little width, is flat,\r\nand six miles to the east of Monte Video. The isle of Martim Garcia is\r\nto the west-north-west of the bay of Colonia do Sacramento, in front\r\nof the mouth of the river St. Francisco. The isle of St. Gabriel, four\r\nhundred and fifty fathoms long, its width proportionable, is in front\r\nof Colonia; as well as the isle of Antonio Lopes, and the English\r\nIsland, both small. That of Fornos, two hundred and forty fathoms long,\r\napproximates nearer to the beach. The island of Marinheiros, three to\r\nfour leagues in circuit, flat and covered with trees and brushwood, is\r\nnear the southern extremity of the lake of Patos, and a little to the\r\nnorth of the town of St. Pedro, whose inhabitants have recourse to it\r\nfor water and firewood.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Terra-sombra, or umber, calcareous stone, potters’ earth,\r\ngold, silver, and sulphureous minerals.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--Timber is more remarkable here for its fine quality than\r\nits abundance. From the parallel of 30° degrees southward, on the\r\nbanks of the principal rivers only, are to be seen any forests of fine\r\nfull-grown timber. Out of these latitudes, in this province, trees are\r\nrare and of small size. In the southern parts, they burn bones and the\r\nexcrements of cattle, in consequence of the scarcity of wood. In the\r\nnorthern there are beautiful pine trees.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--Five nations held their dominion in this province.\r\nThe Patos in the peninsula, and to the north of the lake which has\r\ntaken their name; the Charruas, around the lake Mirim, and as far as\r\nthe river Plate; the Minuânos, to the westward of the latter; the\r\nTappes, from the lake Patos to the Uruguay; the Guaycanans, in the\r\ncattle plains, where they still reside at times. Of the first there is\r\nnow no account, and they appear to be extinct, having most probably\r\nintermixed with other tribes. The Charrúas have retired into the centre\r\nof the country. The Minuânos occupy the lands to the westward of the\r\nTappes from the Ibicui southward. Between the Minuânos and the Charrúas\r\nenmity perpetually exists, and frequently wars occur. They both use the\r\nlance, the arrow, and the sling, and are expert on horseback. Grapuetan\r\nis the name of the country where the Minuânos reside for a considerable\r\npart of the year. The Tappes in great numbers formerly lived under the\r\ninfluence of the Christian missions of the Uruguay.\r\n\r\nAmongst other species of wild quadrupeds, there are the _anta_, like\r\na little cow without horns, as common in the West Indies, the deer,\r\nthe ounce, the monkey, the _paca_, like a pig of two months old, the\r\nrabbit, _quati_, _cotia_, _tatous_, or armadillo, covered with scales,\r\nthe _jaraticáca_, or squash, which the Spaniards and Portuguese call\r\n_forrilho_, the boar, the fox, with various kinds of dogs, _viz._ the\r\n_jaguaratirica_, _guará_, _guaraxain_, and the _jaguane_. The race of\r\nthe European species of dog have here multiplied excessively, so that\r\nthey live in the plains, where they subsist with others of the wild\r\nkind, without ever entering any village or dwelling. They are called\r\n_chimarrōe_ dogs. Immediately on the slaughter of cattle ceasing, and\r\nwhen in want of provisions, they assemble together in large bands, and\r\nencircle an ox, which they pursue with unceasing obstinacy until the\r\nanimal falls with fatigue, and is devoured by them in a few hours. A\r\nhorseman even runs a risk in the plains, when they are in a state of\r\nfamine. No province in the Brazil abounds with such prodigious herds\r\nof cattle, horses, and mules. Goats are not very numerous. The sheep\r\nproduce a fine wool.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the last century this province was covered with\r\ncattle, in spite of the devastation which the Indian and the ounce had\r\nmade amongst them. The conquerors, persuaded that such a profusion of\r\ncattle never would have an end, commenced by carrying on a destruction\r\namongst them resembling that of the tiger and the wolf in the\r\nsheepfold. This havoc was principally directed against the calves, and\r\ngenerally one did not suffice for the dinner of two comrades; probably\r\nthey both wished to eat the tongue, and to make a greater certainty\r\nof it they killed a second calf, rather than divide the first. There\r\nwere men who killed an animal in the morning in order to breakfast on\r\nbroiled kidneys; and, not to be incommoded by carrying any part of the\r\nmeat for dinner, performed the same operation by killing the best they\r\ncould discover for dinner. There was no banquet without veal only a few\r\ndays old.\r\n\r\nDon Joaquim Vianna, governor of Monte Video, hearing of this\r\ndestruction of the cattle, and informed of the cause, issued an\r\norder, about the year 1650, with a heavy penalty attached to its\r\ntransgression, that no more calves or cows should be killed, excepting\r\nsuch cows as were barren; and that no bulls or oxen should be\r\nslaughtered for their skins, excepting those of five years of age and\r\nupwards. In the vice-royalty of the Marquis de Lavradio, some good\r\narrangements were made in the northern part of the province; but all\r\nwere not under their influence, in consequence of the widely spreading\r\ndistricts, to many of which they did not extend.\r\n\r\nTwo small portions of the cattle of this province are appropriated, one\r\nto the consumption of the country, and the other to the slaughter-house\r\nof the metropolis; but the far greatest proportion is manufactured\r\ninto jirked-beef, which is salted without bones, dried in the sun, and\r\nexported to the principal ports in the Brazil; but, from the desultory\r\nwarfare carried on near the river Plate, it has recently become very\r\nscarce, and _bacalhao_, or salt fish, brought by British ships to\r\nthe ports of Brazil, has become a substitute at many places.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, there were yet only amongst the subjects of the faithful\r\ncrown, five hundred and thirty-nine proprietors of land,\r\njudicially marked out amongst the breeders of cattle, denominated\r\n_fazendeiros_, or farmers, and _lavradores_, or husbandmen,\r\nwhich latter breed only what is necessary for their own service and\r\nconsumption; they possess generally about two square leagues of land:\r\nbut those of the first order have eight or ten square leagues, and\r\nsome even more. The greatest proportion of the cattle are breeding\r\ncows. In a plain or field of three leagues are usually bred four or\r\nfive thousand head, and proportionably more or less, according to the\r\nquality of the land, or attention of the breeder. The pasturage is not,\r\nhowever, generally good, the soil being, as before mentioned, of a\r\nsandy nature.\r\n\r\nFor the management of a fazenda of five thousand head of cattle, it\r\nis said six men are sufficient, with one hundred horses at least;\r\nthe whole of which pasture together in troops of twenty, with a\r\ntamed mare, from which they do not usually stray. From the sandy\r\nnature of the soil, as in many other parts of Brazil, particularly at\r\nPernambuco, no expense is incurred by the owners for shoeing them.\r\nIn each establishment, or tract of land, there is commonly a small\r\nhill, or the most elevated land is selected, as plain and even at the\r\nsummit as possible, which is known by the name of _rodeio_, (a\r\ncertain compass of land,) and is capable of receiving the whole flock,\r\nwhen brought together. For this purpose, the shepherds on horseback\r\ndistribute themselves round about the cattle, and cry out loudly\r\n“_Rodeio, rodeio, rodeio_;” at whose voices the cattle march at\r\nfull trot towards the rodeio, in files, divided into droves or bands of\r\nfifty to one hundred, according to the numbers that pasture together.\r\nThis mode of forming them early into troops is indispensable, in order\r\nto put on the mark of the dono or proprietor upon such as have it not,\r\nand with more facility to select those that are upwards of four years\r\nold for the market, or for _carne-secco_, or jirked beef.\r\n\r\nIf the stock of cattle exceed the number of heads which the fazenda is\r\ncapable of sustaining, they of course run short of pasturage, and many\r\nspread out into more distant plains, and after a time will no longer\r\nobey the rodeio, but fly and disorder the rest of the flock.\r\n\r\nIn a fazenda of three leagues it is computed that one thousand young\r\ncattle, male and female, are branded or marked, annually; consequently\r\nthe number they send off or kill may be estimated in the same ratio.\r\n\r\nThe farmers also breed a certain number of domestic cattle. He who\r\npossesses four thousand cattle, which are denominated _bravo_, or\r\nwild, keeps commonly one hundred milch cows, which, however, pasture\r\nin the same fields or plains with the others. When a cow calves, she\r\nalways selects a situation adapted to the concealment of her young,\r\nwhere it continues in secrecy for the space of eight days. She visits\r\nit at different times in the course of the day, in order to give it\r\nsuck, lying by it at night. It is difficult to find them during this\r\nperiod; but once discovered the calf is immediately conducted to the\r\ncattle fold, where it is kept eight or nine months or more, being daily\r\nvisited by its dam, which is milked the whole of this time, for the\r\npurpose of making butter and cheese, leaving to the prisoner only what\r\nit can draw from its mother after she has been milked. The familiarity\r\nof the young one with the persons upon the fazenda preserves it in a\r\nstate of tameness. The males, when sufficiently grown, are used in the\r\ncart or plough, and the females pasture in the plains till they become\r\nmothers, continuing to supply the farmer with an increasing stock.\r\n\r\nAlthough the domesticated cattle are not bred up with such a satiety\r\nof provision as the wild ones, which enjoy the whole of the mother’s\r\nmilk, and pasture the entire day without working, yet they grow as\r\nlarge and become fatter. This is attributed to the fearful nature of\r\nthe undomesticated kind, who fly from every animal that appears; whilst\r\nthe tame ones, although they eat less, live in quiet, always retaining\r\nthe habit of going to the fold, and approaching people without alarm;\r\nthey are also less time in the fields, consuming less pasturage, and it\r\nis estimated that the aliment which four thousand head of wild cattle\r\nexhaust is sufficient to sustain eight thousand of the tame. The meat\r\nof the latter is esteemed the most savoury.\r\n\r\nThe same _fazendeiros_ breed also droves of horses and mules. The\r\nlatter are the most lucrative, a male one being at least double the\r\nvalue of a horse; and in consequence, its species is more numerous,\r\nalthough very few persons breed more than two hundred annually. The she\r\nmules of two years old are either sold or separated from the rest, in\r\norder to avoid the destruction which they would cause in the species. A\r\nshe mule seeing the foal of a mare, immediately begins to caress it as\r\nher own, and will not allow the mother to approach to give it milk; the\r\nresult is, that it perishes with hunger.\r\n\r\nThe breed of sheep would, if attended to, much exceed that of cattle,\r\nin consequence of their generally producing two at a birth; they are\r\nnot however numerous, few farmers possessing one thousand head, and\r\nthe major part not any. Nothing here appears so easy and cheap as the\r\nmultiplication of this animal. For the purpose of shepherding a flock\r\nof one thousand, two cur dogs are sufficient, bred up in the following\r\nmode. As soon as they are whelped, the lambs of a ewe are killed,\r\nthe puppies are put to her, and she suckles them until she becomes\r\nhabituated to treat them as her young, when, upon opening their eyes\r\nand seeing no other benefactor, they attach themselves to her, and play\r\nwith the lambs as if they were of the same species. Nothing is ever\r\ngiven them to eat; they are shut in the fold with the sheep, and on\r\nobtaining strength and vigour to attend the flock, they are suffered\r\nto go at large, when they accompany it to the field. In a little time,\r\nand without more instruction, they are so familiarized with the sheep,\r\nthat they never separate from them. When it happens that a ewe lambs in\r\nthe field, and the lamb cannot accompany the mother, in consequence of\r\nits not yet having sufficient strength to follow her, one of the dogs\r\nwatches near, and if he finds that the lamb cannot follow the mother\r\nto the flock, he carries it in his mouth, without doing it the least\r\nharm. No other animal or unknown person can approach the sheep, of\r\nwhich these dogs are the guardians, without the risk of being attacked.\r\nThe other domestic dogs and the hordes of the chimarroe dogs are the\r\ngreatest enemies to the flock; against them and the birds of prey,\r\nwhich pick out the eyes of the lambs, the vigilance of the watch dogs\r\nis requisite.\r\n\r\nAmongst other species of birds are the Macuco partridge, the parrot,\r\n_caroe_, _inhuma_, _sócó_, _tayugu_, _jaluerá_, heron, _jacu_, the\r\n_araponga mutum_, _tucano_, and the quail. In the lakes are large\r\nnumbers of wild ducks, and large wild geese, some brown, some white,\r\nothers with black necks, which when stripped of their feathers, are\r\ncovered with a fine long down, similar to the Armenian fur, and serving\r\nfor the same uses. The marine geese, which have a bill like a turkey,\r\nwith smaller wings and without feathers, for the most part go at the\r\nbottom of the sea, and are seen occasionally upon this coast, as well\r\nas the sea calf. It is said, that here the emu ostrich lays many eggs\r\nin one nest, to which they never return after having finished laying;\r\nthe male then hatches them, after instinctively breaking two, for the\r\ncollection of a large quantity of flies; thus the young find sustenance\r\ntill they are able to accompany their protector, when he remains their\r\nguide for several days. The people do not generally follow hunting or\r\nshooting, so that game is very abundant; neither are they partial to\r\nfishing.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are instructed in the use of the _laço_, in order\r\nto catch wild cattle. It is a cord of twisted leather, secured by one\r\nend of the saddle or girth of the horse, upon which the laçador is\r\nmounted, the other end forms a noose through which the cord runs, and,\r\ncurling it up, the horseman throws with dexterity to a great distance,\r\nand secures the animal by the horns or the neck. The sagacious horse\r\ninstantly throws itself into a firmly inclining posture, to resist the\r\nopposing power of the animal to escape. There are men so skilled in\r\nthis art, that they catch the wary ounce with the laço. The laçador as\r\nquickly dismounts and despatches it.\r\n\r\nThey are not less dexterous in the management of the balls, which are\r\ntwo round stones secured at the extremity of a cord, formed also of\r\nleather, and being thrown at the legs of the animal, unexpectedly\r\nentangles them so effectually, that it cannot move another step. These\r\nspecies of weapons are used by them against each other. This custom was\r\nborrowed from the Maraocoto and other Indian tribes, who used the laço\r\nand balls with great effect against Mendonça when he landed and founded\r\nthe city of Buenos Ayres. The _Peons_, who act as guides, as well\r\nas others of mixed origin, are expert with these weapons.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards denominate the progeny of the Indian and Negro,\r\n_Somboloros_; and of these latter and the Mulatto, _Saccalaguas_; the\r\nson of a Mestico (offspring of a white and an Indian) and an Indian,\r\n_Cholo_. The Portuguese call the first _Curibocas_.\r\n\r\nThe principal towns in this province are St. Pedro, Portalegre, and\r\nMonte Video.\r\n\r\nSt. Pedro is a commercial town, and advantageously situated upon the\r\nextremity of a tongue of land, between the gulf of Manguein to the\r\nsouth and a bay to the north-east. It has a church dedicated to the\r\napostle from whom the town derives its name. It has two orders of\r\ndevout women; the one called St. Francisco and the other Carmo. The\r\nhouses are generally very wretched, and the streets of a fine sand,\r\nthe same as that of the neighbourhood. It enters so profusely into\r\nthe houses, at the season of the high winds, that it is impossible\r\nto eat any thing without a portion of sand being intermixed with it.\r\nThis town, begun a league to the south-west, in the situation called\r\nEstreito, was removed by Gomes Freyre d’Andrade, between the years 1747\r\nand 1750, and was the capital till the year 1763. The heat is intense.\r\nCats fly from the rats, which are large and exceedingly numerous;\r\nbut they have a formidable enemy in the dog. Here are some English\r\nestablishments in connexion with houses at Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nUpon the eastern bank of the river, in front of St. Pedro, is the\r\nconsiderable and flourishing _arraial_ of St. Joze, with a\r\nhermitage of the same name. It is the town’s port; and, in 1814, there\r\nsailed from it three hundred and thirty-three vessels of various kinds,\r\nladen with wheat, hides, _carne-secco_, or dried beef, tallow,\r\ncheese, and other articles. Six leagues to the south of St. Pedro is\r\nthe arraial of Povo Novo, ornamented with a hermitage of Nosso Senhora\r\ndas Necessidades. Its inhabitants, originally from the Azore islands,\r\nare husbandmen.\r\n\r\nPortalegre (delightful port) is a large, populous, and commercial\r\ntown, has good houses, and straight streets, principally paved, and\r\nis situated upon the southern margin of a bay to the eastward of the\r\nJacuhy, seven leagues above its mouth, and forty-three leagues north\r\nof St. Pedro. It is the capital of the province, the residence of the\r\ngovernor, now Conde de Figura, of the ouvidor, and a vicar-general. It\r\nhas a church, dedicated to Our Lady Madre de Deos, (Mother of God,) the\r\nchapel Das Dores, (of Grief,) an hospital, a Junta da Fazenda Real,\r\n(a treasury,) and a Cadeira regia de Latim, (a royal professorship of\r\nLatin.) The senate is presided by a Juiz de Fora, or a judge similar to\r\na mayor, who also presides over the orphan establishment.\r\n\r\nWith the loss of the town of St. Pedro, in 1762, the village of Nosso\r\nSenhora de Conceiçao, became the capital, and the hermitage with\r\nwhich it was ornamented the parochial for some years, inasmuch as the\r\ngovernor, Joze Marcellino de Figueyredo did not remove the seat of\r\ngovernment; but increased and improved this village, to which he gave\r\nthe name so appropriate to its good port. In 1808, it received the\r\ntitle of town.\r\n\r\nA great part of the commodities that are exported from the port of the\r\ntown of St. Pedro, are shipped thither from Portalegre, in hyates, or\r\nsmall craft.\r\n\r\nThe adjacent country is fertile and watered by the Cahy, Caravatahy,\r\nand other rivers.\r\n\r\nAbout four leagues to the north-east of Portalegre, and not quite a\r\nmile from the right bank of the Caravatahy, in an elevated and fine\r\nsituation, is the parish of Nosso Senhora dos Anjos, founded by the\r\nsame governor, J. M. de Figueyredo, for the habitation of various Tappe\r\nIndian families, fugitives from the missions of the Uruguay. These\r\nIndians established a large fazenda for breeding cattle, in order\r\nthat they might better sustain themselves; and who, notwithstanding\r\nthey were freed from the capitation, and exempted from the rod and\r\ndiscipline under which they had been brought up, withdrew by degrees\r\nto various situations in the province. The river is very winding, its\r\nbanks abounding with timber, stone, and fine potters’ clay.\r\n\r\nA little more than thirty-five miles to the west of Portalegre is the\r\nconsiderable and delightful arraial of the new parish, near the mouth\r\nof the Tacoary. Its inhabitants raise wheat and cattle.\r\n\r\nAbout eighteen miles to the north is the parish of St. Joze, with a\r\nlarge praca, or square, on which is the mother church. It was the\r\nsource of the agriculture of this province, and its people are mostly\r\ndescendants of the first settlers from the Azores; from whence Senhor\r\nDon Joze brought various families. They began to cultivate wheat and\r\nIndian corn according to the method of their own country, and which is\r\nat this day the occupation and support of their posterity.\r\n\r\nLittle more than three leagues to the west of the new parish, is\r\nsituated the pleasant arraial of St. Amaro, also upon the northern\r\nmargin of the Jacuhy, and ornamented with a magnificent church.\r\n\r\nEight leagues to the west of St. Amaro is the considerable town of Rio\r\nPardo, at the mouth of the river from which it borrows the name, and\r\nhas a church called Nossa Senhora do Rozario; also two chapels. It\r\noccupies four small eminences, and had its commencement with a fort\r\ndedicated to St. Lourenço, received the title of town in 1812, and that\r\nof a countship in 1815.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles from it is the village of St. Nicoláu, with a hermitage\r\nof that name. The people who inhabit it are descended from the\r\naborigines. About twelve leagues south of Rio Pardo is the arraial and\r\nchapel of St. Barbara da Encruzilhada, in an elevated and pleasant\r\nsituation, and having most excellent waters. Ten leagues above Rio\r\nPardo, upon the northern bank of the Jacuhy, is the considerable\r\narraial of Cachoeirá, with a church of the Lady of Conceiçao. It\r\nhas wide, straight, and clean streets, and possesses advantages for\r\nbecoming much more considerable.\r\n\r\nTwelve leagues to the south of Cachoeirá is situated the arraial of\r\nCussapabá, upon a small hill near the source of the river St. Barbara,\r\nwith the chapel of the Lady of Assumpçao.\r\n\r\nNorth-east of Portalegre about fifteen leagues is the small town of\r\nSt. Antonio da Patrulha, near the road, in an elevated country. Its\r\ninhabitants cultivate mandioca, sugar, and bananas, with other fruits.\r\n\r\nTo the north of Patrulha, in an extensive plain upon the General\r\nSerra, is the parish of Nossa Senhora do Oliveira. Cattle are its main\r\ncommodity.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula formed by the ocean and the lake Patos is divided into\r\nthree parishes. To the west of the lakes Patos and Mirim are the\r\nparishes of Espirito Santo, Nossa Senhora da Conceiçao de Piratinin,\r\nSt. Francisco de Paulo, Nossa Senhora de Conceiçao de Canguçú, in the\r\nvicinity of the river Camapuan, and St. Sebastiam do Bajé, near the\r\norigin of that river; all in the diocese of Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nThe following places are in the diocese of Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nMonte Video, with the title of city, is situated in a pleasant plain at\r\nthe extremity of a peninsula, which forms the eastern side of a bay\r\nalmost two leagues long, and one wide at the entrance. It is fortified\r\nwith various batteries towards the sea, and a citadel on the land side.\r\nIt has a church dedicated to the apostles St. Filippi and St. Tiago, a\r\nconvent of St. Franciscans, an hospital, good houses with flat roofs\r\nand parapets, and straight streets. The inhabitants enjoy a salubrious\r\nair, but are inconvenienced from the want of wood. They drink\r\nrain-water, collected in cisterns, which are formed in the inner courts\r\ncommon to the houses, and this water is pure and excellent. There are\r\nalso pits dug near the sea-side, from whence water is brought in carts\r\nfor the supply of the town. It is one hundred and thirty miles to the\r\nwest of Cape St. Mary, and one hundred and twenty east of Buenos Ayres.\r\nIts port, at the extremity of which there is a small island fortified,\r\nhas not sufficient depth of water in all parts for large vessels.\r\nThe _pamperos_, which are furious tempests from the south-west,\r\noccasion at times very great injury, and the sea here is greatly\r\nsubjected to the influence of these winds. It was taken by the English\r\nin June, 1807, and given up again at the end of some months. There are\r\na few English establishments here, but the trade is trifling compared\r\nwith that of Buenos Ayres. The suburbs are thickly inhabited, and have\r\ntwo parochials, both dedicated to Our Lady of Carmo. More distant\r\nthere are two others, Pinheral and Pedras, and their parishioners are\r\nbreeders of cattle.\r\n\r\nMaldonado is a small town, but which, with much facility, might become\r\nvery considerable, from the circumstances of its favourable situation\r\nupon a fine bay, bearing the same name, and the fertility of its\r\nadjacent district. It is adorned by the church of St. Carlos; and the\r\ninhabitants are chiefly descendants of the Portuguese. It is fifteen\r\nleagues west of Cape St. Mary.\r\n\r\nPueblo Novo, founded for the habitation of the Portuguese prisoners of\r\nColonia do Sacramento, is two leagues to the north of Maldonado, and\r\nhas a church called St. Carlos. Near twenty-five leagues to the north\r\nof Pueblo Novo is the parish of Nossa Senhora da Conceiçao de Minas.\r\n\r\nSt. Domingos Suriano is a small town, well situated near the mouth\r\nof the river Negro, in a country abundant in corn and pastures,\r\nwhere large quantities of cattle are bred, which, with lime, are the\r\nprincipal exports. Eight leagues distant from St. Domingos Suriano is\r\nthe parish of Nossa Senhora das Merces, near the margin of the Negro.\r\nAbout five leagues from the same place upon the St. Salvador, is the\r\nparish of Espenilho; and fourteen leagues from Espenilho, that of\r\nViboras.\r\n\r\nNine leagues to the north-east of Monte Video is the parish of Nossa\r\nSenhora of Guadalupe de Canneloes. There are also the parishes of\r\nPerongos, which is in the central part of the district; of Hy, upon the\r\nriver from which it takes the name; of St. Joze and of St. Luzia, near\r\nthe rivers which bear their names; of Sacramento, where the Portuguese\r\nfounded it; and of Pintado, along the sea. Serro Largo, with the title\r\nof a town, is delightfully situated near the place of the same name,\r\nand is the nearest to the Portuguese frontiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n                         PROVINCE OF PARANNA.\r\n\r\n   _Boundaries--Climate--Productions--Matte the most\r\n   lucrative--First Discoverers--Proceedings of the\r\n   Spanish Jesuits--Guarani Indians formed into Reduçoes,\r\n   or Villages--Nature of those Missions--Expulsion\r\n   of the Jesuits--Delivery of the Missions to other\r\n   Ecclesiastics--their Decay--Mountains--Mineralogy--Rivers and\r\n   Lakes--Phytology--Zoology--Towns, Parishes, &c.--Remaining\r\n   Establishments of the Jesuitical Missions._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis province is bounded on the north by Matto Grosso, on the west\r\nand south by the Paraguay, and on the east by the Uruguay and the\r\nParanna, which latter affords it the name, and divides it into two\r\nunequal parts, northern and southern. It is altogether situated in\r\nthe temperate zone, between 24° and 33° 30′ south latitude, being six\r\nhundred and fifty miles long from north to south, and more than two\r\nhundred and fifty at its greatest width from east to west. The winter,\r\nwhich commences in May and lasts till October, is cold. The prevailing\r\nwind in this province is from the south-west. The climate is temperate\r\nand wholesome, with the exception of those marshy situations, and\r\nothers which occasionally overflow, where the fever reigns periodically\r\nin certain months. This is a country almost universally low, with few\r\nmountains and hills, and these of inconsiderable elevation. The land\r\nis generally excellent, and adapted to almost all the productions\r\nof the torrid zone, as well as those of the temperate. Wheat and\r\nIndian corn are abundant, as are the plantations of cane, cotton, and\r\nmandioca. The most lucrative, however, are those of the _matte_.\r\nThese productions do not prosper generally in all the districts; wheat\r\nrarely grows but in the southern parts, and matte in the northern. The\r\npeach tree is so prodigiously abundant in the southern islands of the\r\nParaguay and the adjacent country, that they are frequently cut down in\r\norder to heat the oven with their branches. They are not met with to\r\nthe north of St. Fé.\r\n\r\nSebastian Caboto and Diogo Garcia were the discoverers of this country,\r\non advancing up the Paraguay in 1526.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Assumption was the first establishment in the province\r\nafter the fort of St. Anna, and suffered much from the various\r\nneighbouring nations of barbarous Indians, principally the Guaycurus\r\nand Payagoas, who were as numerous as they were ferocious and brave. It\r\nwas, however, rendered defensible by the augmentation of its settlers.\r\nDefective in gold and silver mines, which attracted so many people\r\nto Peru and Mexico, this fine country, so advantageously situated,\r\nremained for many years after its discovery almost unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe middle and eastern parts were the conquests of the Jesuits, by the\r\nintroduction of Christianity amongst their possessors, the Guaranis.\r\nThese priests, knowing, from experience, the relaxation of European\r\nmorals, and how much it prevailed amongst the American colonists,\r\ndetermined to catechize only those Indians who were at a distance from\r\nthe Europeans, in order that the proselytes should not know practices\r\ncontrary to the precepts to be taught. The perfection with which they\r\nsoon spoke the Guaranitic idiom, and the docility of this tribe of\r\nIndians, concurred equally to carry into effect this wished-for object.\r\n\r\nIn a few years the Jesuits reduced the various hordes of this nation\r\nto a settled life, in large _aldeias_, or villages, denominated\r\n_reduçōes_, the number of which, in the year 1630, had arrived\r\nat twenty, with seventy thousand inhabitants. Those who had advanced\r\nto the Upper Paranna, with the intention of extending the spiritual\r\nconquest, were obliged, by eight thousand Paulistas, to fall back, in\r\n1631, to the south of the Maracajú Serra. The Jesuit, Montoya, relates,\r\nthat he and his colleagues retired from above to below the seven falls\r\nof the Paranna, with two thousand Indians, when the Paulistas invaded\r\nthe Upper Paranna, and that the latter continued hostilely to visit the\r\n_reduçōes_ of the Lower Paranna; and that, in 1637, one hundred\r\nand forty Paulistas, with one thousand five hundred Indians, attacked\r\nthe _reduçōes_ of Jesu Maria, St. Christovam, and St. Anna, and\r\nretired with seven thousand prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits next reduced the Tappes to the eastward, and continued to\r\ncivilize those two nations, by teaching them all the useful arts, thus\r\nforming the celebrated Guaranitic empire, which moderate calculators\r\nnever raised to more than two hundred thousand inhabitants; and it is\r\nsaid they were able to carry into the field an army of forty thousand\r\nmen. One authority states that between the rivers Uruguay and Paraguay\r\nwas established a powerful republic, comprising thirty-one large\r\nvillages, inhabited by one hundred thousand souls; but Guthrie raises\r\nthe population of these missions to three hundred and forty thousand\r\nfamilies, making a surprising and incredible population of thirteen\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt is said the word _Guarrannis_ means _Guerreiros_, (warriors,) and\r\nthat this people, in former times, wandered about, carrying destruction\r\nto every part within their reach, and obtaining many prisoners, thus\r\nacquiring greater numbers and power. Their language and name became\r\ncommon to divers tribes, whom these religious teachers introduced\r\ninto their associations, from different parts, by which they greatly\r\naugmented the population of this republic. The exchequer of the\r\ncatholic crown furnished annually forty to fifty thousand ducats to the\r\nmissionaries employed in this conquest, inasmuch as the Indians did\r\nnot render their agriculture and industry adequate to the expenditure\r\nand support of the country, the public receipts of which the Jesuits\r\nwere the receivers and appropriators. When the villages and temples\r\nwere completed, each man, from eighteen to fifty years, paid annually a\r\ncapitation of two gold pieces. The captains (_caciques_) were exempted\r\nfrom this tribute as well as their first born, (_primogenitas_,)\r\nand twelve men more in each mission destined to the service of the\r\nchurch. In 1634, when there was already thirty _reduçōes_ with one\r\nhundred and twenty-five thousand Christian Indians, the number that\r\npaid tribute only amounted to nineteen thousand one hundred and\r\nsixteen. In 1649, with a view of gaining more subjects, and to avoid\r\nany desertion to the territory of the crown of Portugal, where there\r\nwas no capitation, the Indians were alleviated from one-half of this\r\ntribute. Four years previously was conceded to them the power of\r\nexporting the _matte_, upon certain conditions, in order that they\r\nmight become less chargeable to the capitation. The concession of this\r\nliberty was a means of feeding the cupidity of the Jesuits, by the\r\nintervention of the curates of the _reduçōes_ serving them as a cloak\r\nthrough the Indians, to carry on a great trade in this commodity, to\r\nthe prejudice of the merchants at Assumption, whose complaints produced\r\ntwo decrees; the one apprizing the chief priest of Paraguay of the\r\nexorbitant quantity of _matte_ which its padres had traded in; the\r\nother prohibiting the Indians from carrying more than twelve thousand\r\narrobas annually to that city.\r\n\r\nEach of the _reduçōes_, otherwise called missions, was a considerable\r\ntown, laid out with straight streets. The houses, generally of earth,\r\nwere whitened, covered with tiles, and had verandas on each side,\r\nin order to preserve them from the sun and rain. On seeing one, a\r\ncorrect idea might be formed of the whole. Each mission had only a\r\nmother church, generally of stone, magnificent and richly ornamented,\r\nsome being entirely gilded. A vicar and a curate, both Jesuits, were\r\nthe only ecclesiastics exercising the parochial functions, being,\r\nat the same time, inspectors of all civil economy; under whose\r\ndirection there were magistrates, (_corregedores_,) elected annually;\r\na _cacique_, or chief, elected for life; and other officers, each\r\nwith his jurisdiction. With the exception of these, every individual\r\nof both sexes wore a shirt reaching to the ancles, usually of\r\nwhite cotton. They cultivated _matte_, the cotton tree, and such\r\nprovisions as prospered best in the country. The whole was deposited\r\nin warehouses, from whence it was distributed daily to the people.\r\nEach family received an ounce of _matte_, four pounds of meat, and a\r\ncertain measure of Indian corn, and more if it was judged necessary.\r\nAll passed under the review of the magistrates or of other subordinate\r\npersons. The curates lived commodiously, near to their churches, and\r\ncontiguous to their dwellings were two spacious houses; one destined\r\nfor schools of reading, painting, architecture, music, and having shops\r\nfor different manual occupations; the other was a _recolhimento_,\r\nor receptacle for a great number of young girls, who were engaged\r\nin different works, under the inspection of matronly women, already\r\ninstructed. The women received on Monday a certain portion of cotton,\r\nwhich they were to return in the spun state on Saturday. The curate,\r\naccompanied by certain officers and masters, went daily at eight\r\no’clock to visit the schools and shops. The signal of the last _Avi\r\nMarias_ was also that of the _rosario_, or counting of beads, at which\r\nall assisted.\r\n\r\nAll superfluities were exported, with a large quantity of tallow,\r\nhides, and _matte_, and with the proceeds they paid the capitations,\r\nand obtained in return requisite European articles.\r\n\r\nIt is calculated that the Indians possessed near two million head of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of the _reduçōes_, or missions, which\r\nconstituted the pretended Guaranitic state, in 1768, when the Jesuits\r\nwere expelled and their people delivered over to the direction of\r\nthe Dominicans, Franciscans, and Mercenarians. The last is an order\r\nof friars instituted in Arragon by King James for the redemption of\r\ncaptives.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Bucarelli, governor of Buenos Ayres, wishing to go\r\npersonally, accompanied by the best troops of Europe which he could\r\ncollect in that capital, to execute the orders of his sovereign\r\nrelative to the missions, which were repugnant to the feelings of the\r\nIndians, wrote, before he commenced his march, to all the vicars to\r\nsend to him the chief (_cacique_) and head magistrate of each\r\nmission, in order that he might communicate to them advices from\r\nhis Majesty. On their arrival at Buenos Ayres he unjustly retained\r\nthem as hostages, with a view of obviating any difficulty that might\r\narise. In Yapegú, which is the first mission, was presented to him the\r\ncelebrated chief, Nicolau, who in Europe passed for the sovereign of\r\nthe Guaranitic republic, and who was not able to proceed in the train\r\nof the others, in consequence of the infirmities of old age, being\r\nthen seventy. The Europeans and their descendants began to frequent\r\nthe missions, and the Indians to have mutual relations with them,\r\nand to learn from them many of the most familiar words, also some\r\nrelaxation from the more correct morals and manners of the Jesuits.\r\nThe population, in consequence, soon began to diminish, as well as the\r\nneatness and cleanliness of their houses and temples.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--In the northern part there is the serra of Maracaju,\r\nwhich is of trifling altitude; and the Lambara, in the vicinity of\r\nthe capital, also not of remarkable elevation, although it exceeds in\r\nheight all those that encompass it.\r\n\r\nThe mineralogy consists of _gesso_, or plaster, limestone, granite, and\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND LAKES.--Besides the three great rivers that limit this\r\nprovince, there are many others which water the interior, and some of\r\nthem navigable for a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nThe Gualeguay, which has a course of more than one hundred and forty\r\nmiles, empties itself into the Uruguay, a few leagues above the Negro,\r\nafter having watered a level country, rich in cattle, corn, and fruit\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe Mirinay, which also runs into the Uruguay, fifty miles below the\r\nIbicui, is considerable, and runs through an extensive country, stocked\r\nwith large cattle.\r\n\r\nThe Taquary, seventy miles long, empties itself also into the Uruguay,\r\nninety miles below the preceding.\r\n\r\nThe Jaguare, rising in the Serra Maracaju, runs into the Paranna,\r\ntwelve leagues below the Setequedas (Seven Falls).\r\n\r\nAccording to a map of the country, which does not appear a bad one, the\r\nAcarahy is the first considerable river which enters the Paranna by the\r\nright bank, seventy miles below the Setequedas.\r\n\r\nThe Tibiquary, which is considerable, disembogues into the Paraguay\r\nninety miles above the confluence of the Paranna. The Cannabé, after a\r\ncourse of one hundred miles, enters the Paraguay fifty miles north of\r\nthe Tibiquary.\r\n\r\nThe lake Ibera, otherwise Caracares, is pretty considerable, and\r\napproximates the left margin of the Paranna; it has some islands, and\r\nits neighbouring lands are marshy. Charts do not accord as to its size:\r\nsome give it one hundred and fifty miles in length, and little less in\r\nwidth; others, ninety in length, and twenty in width; they agree that\r\nit communicates with the Uruguay by the Mirinay, and with the Paraguay\r\nby the Correntes, which empties itself near thirty-five miles below St.\r\nLuzia. It is also said to communicate in two parts with the Paranna.\r\nThe lake Jagapé, which is large, and surrounded with woods, is near the\r\nnorthern bank of the Paranna, about sixty miles above the town of Itaty.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--The cedar, which is of various sorts, the _páu\r\nd’arco_, (bow wood,) sassafras, with many other trees of fine\r\ntimber for building; the pine tree, and those which afford a resin\r\ndenominated the blood of the dragon, and the oil of _cupahiba_;\r\nthe ipecacuanha, jalap, rhubarb, and other medicinal plants; the\r\n_opuncia_, pine-apple, orange, banana, and _mamoe_, of which\r\nlast tree there are male and female; the male bears no fruit but only\r\nflowers, the female bears fruit and no flowers.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable _matte_ is a large shrub or bush, with leaves\r\nsimilar to an orange tree, and tastes of mallows; it is said the serra\r\nMaracaju produces the best. It is usual not to wait for the leaves\r\nfalling, but they are plucked, and then dried by some of the most\r\napproved methods, generally upon hides between two fires. This plant\r\nis taken almost like tea, and the use of this beverage has prevailed\r\nfrom time immemorial amongst the Indians of the northern part of this\r\nprovince. It was they who introduced it amongst the first inhabitants\r\nof Assumption.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--This province is prodigiously abundant in cattle, horses,\r\nand mules; sheep are numerous, but goats few. There is a sufficiency\r\nof hogs for the consumption of the inhabitants. Amongst the wild\r\nquadrupeds are remarked the ounce, the deer, the monkey, the fox, the\r\nrabbit, the cat, the _tamandua_, _quaty_, _zorrilha_, or squash, the\r\n_tatous_, or armadillo, _paca_, _cotia_, and the boar. Of birds, the\r\nemu ostrich, the _seriema_, _jaburu_, _cegonha_, _garca_, _mutun_,\r\n_jacu_, _colhereira_, _urubu_, _tucano_, _rola_, troquaze pigeons,\r\nthe parrot, _codornize_, or quail, _beija-flor_, or humming-bird, the\r\n_guiraponga_, and the partridge. There are also a diversity of wild\r\nducks and geese.\r\n\r\nThe principal _povoações_ are, Assumpçao, or Assumption, Correntes,\r\nCoruguaty, and Villa Rica.\r\n\r\nAssumpçao, an episcopal city, is in a state of mediocrity, possessing\r\nsome commerce. It is the capital and the residence of the governor,\r\nand is situated upon the margin of the Paraguay, which daily washes\r\naway a part of the ground upon which it is built. It is ornamented\r\nwith a hospital, with convents of the Dominicans, Franciscans,\r\nMercenarians, Recoletos, (rigid friars,) and a seminary which was a\r\nJesuitical college. This city has no regularity nor fine edifices;\r\nthe greater part of the houses are built of earth, and many of the\r\ninhabitants of its three parishes are descended from the Portuguese.\r\nFrom hence is exported tobacco, _imbe_, timber, and a prodigious\r\nquantity of matte to Buenos Ayres, where it is afterwards packed in\r\nhides, and distributed over various Spanish districts, being a beverage\r\nuniversally used amongst them, as well as by the Portuguese in the\r\nsouthern parts of Brazil. In its environs are bred numerous herds of\r\nlarge cattle. There are plantations of cotton and the cane. Honey and\r\nwax are abundant. They cultivate also, as in other parts, _aipim_,\r\nor _pompim_, as it is called here, which root, after being\r\nscraped, chopped, and dried in the oven, is cooked with meat, serving\r\nfor bread. The maize, or Indian corn, after it is boiled, and beat in a\r\npestle, is passed through a sifter, kneaded with milk, and baked, when\r\nit receives the name of _chippa_.\r\n\r\nThe bishop is a suffragan of La Plata, otherwise _chuquissaca_.\r\nThe chapter of the church, as in all other ultramarine cathedrals\r\nof the Spanish states, is composed of twelve canons, including the\r\nmoderator of the Inquisition, five dignitaries, the dean, archdeacon,\r\nchanter, treasurer-mór, and master of the college; also six petty\r\ncanons to sing the Evangelists, and as many more half petty canons\r\nfor the Epistles, whose vestments differ little from the others. The\r\ncanons of theology, doctorial, magisterial, and penitentiary, only\r\ngive graduates, and that by competition. The revenue of the suppressed\r\ncanonship is destined for the expenses of the tribunal of the holy\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThere are two tribunals, one called the _Junta Decimal_, for the\r\npublic disposal of the decimos, and consisting of two canons, a royal\r\nfiscal, a minister clothed with a _toga_, or gown, an accountant,\r\nand an _escrivao_, or scrivener. The other denominated _Meza\r\nCapitular_, for the collection and distribution of the proceeds\r\nof the decimos, is formed of a _provisor_, or vicar-general,\r\na canon, acting at times as a fiscal, the _contador-mor_, or\r\nchief accountant of the treasury, and another accountant to make the\r\ndistribution or rates.\r\n\r\nAll the produce of the decimos is appropriated to the church. In\r\ncalculating this, the chief accountant of the treasury divides it\r\ninto nine equal parts; one and a half, under the name of _noveno e\r\nmedio_, belongs to the crown, and is destined for the repairs and\r\nother necessities of the church; and which the sovereign, as patron,\r\ngives by way of succour. Of the other seven and a half parts, one-half\r\nis for the bishop, whose duty is to relieve the necessities of the\r\ndiocesans, especially the poor ones, collected in the house erected for\r\ntheir habitation, because none of them are permitted to solicit alms\r\n_pelas portas_, at the doors.\r\n\r\nThe residue is divided into three equal fifths, one for the dean, the\r\nremainder subdivided anew into three, two are distributed amongst\r\nthe other dignitaries and the canons, with arithmetical proportion.\r\nThe part remaining is portioned equally amongst the petty canons,\r\nand the half petty canons, or chaplains. The priests of the cities\r\nare denominated _reytors_, or rectors, and those of the towns,\r\n_vigarios_, or vicars. The padres only of the Indians have\r\nrevenues, (_congrua_,) drawn from the coffers where the produce of\r\nthe Indian lands that are sold, and the rents of the _emprazadas_,\r\n(persons paying an annual fine for lands bought,) are deposited. They\r\nreceive nothing from the parishioners, except for the solemnization of\r\nburials.\r\n\r\nThe priests of the churches of the whites (_brancos_) alone have\r\nthe altarage, (or free offerings of the people made at the altar,) and\r\nthe productions of the patrimonies with which they were founded.\r\n\r\nThe churches are given after a competition of talent exhibited before\r\nthe bishop. The competitors are convoked by him and the vice-patron,\r\nwho is the governor, and without whose consent nothing can be decided\r\nin these cases. In order to fill up a vacancy, the bishop proposes\r\nthree, the choice from which belongs to the vice-patron, if he does not\r\nreject the whole, and demand a proposal of others for his choice.\r\n\r\nCorrentes is a small city, advantageously situate in the southern angle\r\nof the confluence of the river Paranna, ornamented with a convent of\r\nDominicans, one of Franciscans, and a third of Mercenarians, having\r\nstraight streets, and many houses with one story. The Jesuitical house\r\nis in ruins. Amongst its inhabitants, there are some Portuguese, many\r\nIndians, and a few negroes. In its vicinity there is much marshy\r\nland, and very extensive woods. Cattle and horses are the wealth of\r\nthe country. _Mandubins_, Indian corn, vegetables, water-melons,\r\nand cotton, are the objects of culture. The land is neither adapted\r\nfor wheat nor matte. The ants and locusts, which are extremely\r\nnumerous, destroy the mandioca, and prevent its cultivation. The\r\n_pitangueira_, or _pitangua_ tree, is very abundant; peaches\r\nare not met with. The _imbagay_ is a fruit similar to the mango,\r\nbut something smaller, and found from hence northward. Hides and timber\r\nare the principal articles of exportation. Mosquitoes are extremely\r\ntroublesome here.\r\n\r\nJustice is daily administered by two _alcaldes_, or magistrates,\r\nassisted by two _assessores_, or lawyers. The four are elected\r\nannually by a judicial _cabildo_, composed of twenty-four\r\ngovernors for perpetuity, except in the event of delinquency; four\r\nof whom are principals, namely the royal ensign, the deacon, an\r\nofficer called the _aguazil maior_, and the provincial alcalde.\r\nThe others are ordinaries, each with his inspection, presided by\r\nan assessor-general, called _tenente assessor_, (lieutenant\r\nassessor.) There is an advocate named by the _audiencia_,\r\nor audience-court of the province, for the purpose of defending\r\n_gratis_ the causes of the poor, or those who do not possess a\r\npatrimony of a certain value, and also of prisoners, although they may\r\nbe rich.\r\n\r\nTen leagues to the north of Correntes is the parish of Nehembuçu, on\r\nthe margin of the Paraguay, where they build boats and different sorts\r\nof vessels. Thirty leagues to the south of Correntes is situated the\r\nvillage and parish of St. Luzia, also upon the margin of the Paraguay;\r\nin its district there is _gesso_, a species of plaster, which\r\nforms a branch of exportation. In this interval are the parishes of\r\nAlgarrobas, Esquina, and Goya, abounding sufficiently in meat and fish.\r\n\r\nBagada de St. Fé, and commonly called Paranna, is a small village\r\nsituated upon the Paraguay, in front of St. Fé, in view of an island of\r\nconsiderable extent. From hence is exported a good deal of limestone.\r\n\r\nCoruguaty is a middling town, and celebrated for the large quantity\r\nof matte collected in its district, of which it is the deposit. It is\r\nsituated about thirty leagues to the north-east of Assumption, and\r\nthree miles distant from the left margin of the river from which it\r\nborrows the name.\r\n\r\nFive leagues to the north of it is the _prezidio_ or garrison\r\nof St. Miguel, established in order to obstruct the invasions of the\r\nGuaycuru Indians.\r\n\r\nVilla Rica, where also is accumulated large quantities of matte, lying\r\ntwenty leagues to the south-east of Assumption, is yet small. There is\r\nanother place of the same name on the borders of the Paraguay, to the\r\nnorth of the capital.\r\n\r\nArroio da China is a middling town, situated on the banks of\r\nthe Uruguay, more than thirty leagues above its embouchure. Its\r\ninhabitants, mainly white people, breed cattle and cultivate corn and\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nItaty is a small town, but regular, and well situated upon the\r\nsouthern bank of the Paranna, about thirty leagues above Correntes.\r\nIts inhabitants consist of Indians and some white people; a portion\r\noccupy themselves in potteries, and others in forming plantations\r\nof the cotton tree. The soil and climate are adapted for oranges and\r\nwater-melons, which prosper abundantly.\r\n\r\nIn the country of the missions is to be remarked the following places.\r\n\r\nCandellaria, which took the name from its magnificent church, as did\r\nalmost all the _reduçōes_ of the pretended Guaranitic kingdom,\r\nor the missions of the Paranna, of which it was always considered the\r\ncapital, in consequence of its superior size and population. It is\r\nsituate upon the left bank of the river Paranna, where it inclines to\r\nthe west, near the mouth of a small river.\r\n\r\nCorpus, also on the left margin of the same river, is fifteen leagues\r\nto the north of Candellaria, and is the most northern of the missions,\r\nsituated upon the Paranna, and one of the handsomest in the province.\r\n\r\nBetween the two preceding are situated those of St. Gosme, St. Anna,\r\nSt. Gosme Velho, Nosso Senhora do Loreto, and St. Ignaçio Menor, (the\r\nsmaller.) This last is three leagues above the preceding one, and four\r\nbelow Corpus.\r\n\r\nThe Padre Xarque, says the _reduções_ of Nosso Senhora do Loreto\r\nand St. Ignaçio Menor, were founded for the establishments of the\r\ntwelve thousand Indians, which the Jesuits conducted from the Upper\r\nParanna, when the Paulistas invaded the country.\r\n\r\nItu, upon the same margin of the Paranna, is fifteen leagues to the\r\nwest of Candellaria.\r\n\r\nAssumpçao is fifteen leagues, with little variation, to the south-west\r\nof Corpus, near the mouth of a small river that loses itself in the\r\nUruguay.\r\n\r\nConceiçao is situated sixteen leagues to the south of the preceding\r\none, and little more than three leagues distant from the river Uruguay.\r\n\r\nSt. Thomas is fifteen leagues distant, in a southern direction, from\r\nConceiçao.\r\n\r\nSt. Maria Maior is a few leagues to the north of Conceiçao, also upon\r\nthe margin of the Uruguay.\r\n\r\nApostolos is little more than six leagues to the west of Conceiçao,\r\nupon the road which leads towards Itu; and twenty miles further in the\r\nsame direction upon this road St. Carlos is situated.\r\n\r\nSt. Francisco Xavier is a few leagues to the north of St. Maria, and to\r\nthe east of Candellaria. In this interval Martyres is situated.\r\n\r\nItapuan is on the right bank of the Paranna, to the north of\r\nCandellaria. Trinidade is eight leagues to the north of Itapuan. St.\r\nIgnaçio Guassu (the larger) is near the head of a branch of the river\r\nTibiquary. It is the most ancient of the whole.\r\n\r\nSt. Fé is five leagues to the north-east of St. Ignaçio Guassu. The\r\nmission of Jesus is four leagues to the north-north-west of Trinidad.\r\n\r\nSt. Roza is six leagues to the east of St. Ignaçio Guassu; St. Gosme\r\nfour leagues to the south-east of St. Roza.\r\n\r\nSt. Tiago is eight leagues to the north of Itu; and Yapegu, which is\r\nthe most southern, and amongst the largest of the missions, is situated\r\nnear the Uruguay, a little below the confluence of the Ibicui, and half\r\na league to the north of the river Guavirida. The Jesuits had a college\r\nhere richly ornamented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n                         PROVINCE OF URUGUAY.\r\n\r\n   _Foundation of Aldeias, called Missions, by the Spanish\r\n   Jesuits for the Tappe Indians--Flourish till the Expulsion\r\n   of that Sect--Subsequent Decay--War between the Spaniards\r\n   and Portuguese--Conquest of the Seven Missions by the latter\r\n   Power in 1801--Governor sent--Boundaries--Mountains--Rivers\r\n   --Phytology--Zoology--Names and Population of the Seven\r\n   Missions at their Conquest._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Spanish Jesuits\r\nentered the territory to the east of the river Uruguay, and there\r\nfounded seven large villages, called _reduçōes_, for the\r\nhabitation of various hordes of Tappes, the possessors of the country,\r\nin order the better to civilize and bring them to Christianity, by the\r\nsame means as were practised with those of the Paranna. It has been\r\nalready stated, that, in the treaty of limits of 1750, the exchange\r\nof these missions for Colonia do Sacramento was agreed upon by their\r\nFaithful and Catholic Majesties; and also, that the Jesuits frustrated\r\nits execution in the first instance, and that, on the sudden return\r\nto Rio de Janeiro, of Gomes Freyre d’Andrade, in 1756, things soon\r\nreverted to their anterior state.\r\n\r\nThese _reduçōes_, which made a part of the spiritual Jesuitical\r\nkingdom, flourished to the period of the expulsion of their founders,\r\nwhen they began to decay, and thirty-four years of deterioration,\r\nby imperceptible degrees, could not have transformed the whole more\r\neffectually; in which state they were, in effect, at the beginning of\r\nthe present century, when the declaration of war between the two crowns\r\nin Europe, caused the arming of the inhabitants of the capitania of\r\nRio Grande de St. Pedro, who, since the peace of 1777, had lived in\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time that the Portuguese troops of the town of St.\r\nPedro passed the river of St. Gonçalo, in 1801, against the Spanish\r\nposts, in the vicinity of the western margin of the lake of Patos, a\r\ncorps of Portuguese militia and deserters, attracted by the amnesty,\r\nwere put in motion upon the frontiers of the river Pardo; amongst the\r\nlatter of which appeared Joze Borges do Canto, a native of the country,\r\nand who had deserted from a regiment of dragoons. He immediately\r\noffered to go and commence hostilities in the Spanish territories,\r\non being granted some comrades and the necessary arms. Ammunition\r\nonly was conceded to him, with the liberty of assembling such people\r\ntogether as would join his standard. Having formed a battalion of forty\r\nmen, armed at their own expense, he marched direct to the missions\r\nof Uruguay, and, encountering on the road a known Indian, who was\r\nretiring discontented from the Spaniards, he received from him the\r\ncertain intelligence that the Indians, on hearing of the war, would not\r\nhesitate to subject themselves to the crown of Portugal, as almost all\r\nthe Indian population lived unhappily under their present government.\r\nCanto persuaded the Indian to return, and announce to his compatriots\r\nthe opportunity which was now presented of freeing themselves from\r\nthe Spanish yoke, and of passing under the protection of the Faithful\r\nCrown, and to inform them, that he would afford all necessary\r\nassistance. The Indian, convinced of this, accompanied them to within\r\nsight of St. Miguel, where there was a lieutenant-colonel, commanding\r\na trench which he had formed in apprehension of an attack from the\r\nPortuguese.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived thus far at day-break, Canto sent the Indian forward by\r\na bye-way, with orders to bring him what information he could, to a\r\ncertain situation, whither he should continue to march. As the place\r\nwas very near to the trench, Canto and his party were discovered by\r\nthe sentinel, who called out to arms. Under these circumstances, Canto\r\nsaw himself obliged to advance without order against the entrenched,\r\nwho were in greater disorder; and after discharging a few shots they\r\nabandoned the fortification, retiring to the town, where the commandant\r\nwas, and leaving this intrepid squadron masters of the trench, with ten\r\npieces of artillery.\r\n\r\nThe commandant supposing himself to be attacked by a great number of\r\nanother class of combatants, offered a capitulation to the chief of\r\nthe conquerors, who willingly conceded almost all that was asked, in\r\norder that the Spaniards might leave the country before a reinforcement\r\narrived, or before they knew that it was only forty adventurers,\r\nwithout any corps of reserve, from whom they had fled. The commandant\r\nwas a good deal perplexed, at the execution of the articles of\r\ncapitulation, when Canto, being asked for his degree of rank, replied\r\nthat he was the lowest soldier in the Portuguese army. At this time the\r\nIndians of the place had already united with the Portuguese, and the\r\nadjustment of the treaty was indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards on retiring experienced the misfortune of falling into\r\nthe hands of a similar party, who took them prisoners, and all that\r\nwas conceded to them, against which the commandant protested, and\r\ndemanded the fulfilment of the capitulation. The Spanish officer\r\ncalled upon Canto for an adjustment, who replied, that he could not\r\ninterfere, inasmuch as the party were not subordinate to him, but that\r\nhe would report the affair to the governor of Rio Grande, and all that\r\nhe ordered should be executed; the party in the mean time remaining\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nThe governor, on receiving the account, ordered Canto to fulfil the\r\ncapitulation, excepting the article that gave up the artillery; which,\r\nhe said, ought to belong to his Royal Highness, and to whom he had\r\ngiven a detail of Canto’s valorous deeds, in order that he might be\r\nrewarded. In the mean time he made him captain of a new company of\r\nmilitia; and the person who brought the standard a lieutenant, giving\r\nhim too the liberty of naming for ensign one of his brave companions.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the people of the other missions had witnessed the\r\ncomportment of Canto towards the first that had submitted to him,\r\nalmost all hastened to acknowledge the Faithful Crown. The happy\r\nconqueror released them from some public contributions, which were the\r\nmost heavy upon them, and, freely giving up to them the fruits of their\r\nlabour, received the name of Liberator.\r\n\r\nShortly after the governor sent Major Joaquim Felis to govern the\r\nconquest, with orders to confer with Canto, upon the state of affairs.\r\nHaving delivered the new province to the commandant, and received a\r\ngood reinforcement of regular troops, with some militia and volunteers\r\nfrom the serra above, he obtained permission of the governor to pass to\r\nthe other side of the Uruguay; for which purpose some barks of skins\r\nwere made according to the fashion of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the night of the 1st of November, eighty men, chosen from the army,\r\npassed the river, amongst whom figured some grenadiers of the regiment\r\nof Estremoz; and whose chief was a brave ensign, well known by his\r\nsurname of Padilha. Part of them took up a position in a wood; others\r\nproceeded a little way up the river, keeping near its banks, in order\r\nto give more prompt succour to the first on the signal of attack, which\r\nbegan in the morning, against those who first entered the plain. The\r\nassailants, together with thirty Spaniards, who came to their succour,\r\nwere put to flight, but immediately returned in larger numbers, with\r\nthree field pieces, with which they laboured to open out both their\r\nwings. However, the Portuguese did not give them time for a second\r\ndischarge, but falling intrepidly upon them, they put them to the rout,\r\ntaking their cannon, nine prisoners, and leaving fifteen dead upon the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of the same month, almost at midnight, a cannon was\r\ndischarged in the Passo dos Barros, which is about three leagues\r\nbelow St. Borja, where it was heard; and from whence afterwards\r\narrived an Indian, living in that neighbourhood, with information to\r\nthe Portuguese, that the Spaniards were stationed in the woods, near\r\nthe same pass. They remained the rest of the night under arms. The\r\nfollowing morning Captain Joze Borges do Canto put himself in march\r\nfor this point, with his company and some others, amounting to one\r\nhundred and ten men; and finding the Spaniards entrenched in the woods\r\non the banks of the river, and not discovering any advantageous mode of\r\nattacking them, sent his lieutenant with thirty men dressed in white\r\naccording to the Indian fashion, which marching at a great distance\r\nfrom the Spaniards, and having gained their rear, began firing upon\r\nthem. The first discharges were the signal for the captain to invest\r\nthe fortification, which was abandoned without any resistance, the\r\nSpaniards leaving seventy-four prisoners.\r\n\r\nSuch was the success of the campaign, on the part of the Portuguese,\r\nin this district, and the mode by which the Portuguese crown possessed\r\nitself of the province of the Seven Missions, which made a part of\r\nthat of Rio Grande de St. Pedro, until a governor was named to it. It\r\nis confined on the north by that of St. Paulo; on the west by that of\r\nParanna; and on the south and east by the province of Rio Grande de St.\r\nPedro.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--St. Martinho, the most elevated portion of the\r\nserra, which serves for its eastern limits, and the mountain of St.\r\nLuiz, in the vicinity of the town of its name, are the most remarkable\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--Besides the Uruguay and Ibicui, already mentioned, is\r\nto be remarked the Hyjuhy, which originates at the base of the mountain\r\nof St. Martinho, traverses the province from east to west, empties\r\nitself into the Uruguay in front of Assumption, and a few leagues to\r\nthe north of St. Nicolau, having passed near St. Angelo, a little below\r\nwhich the Hyjuhy-mirim enters it on the left side.\r\n\r\nThe Toropy rises in the same cordillera and falls into the Ibicui. The\r\nJaquari waters a considerable portion of this province, and falls\r\ninto the Ibicui four or five leagues below the Forquilha. The Hibipita\r\nenters the Ibicui also twenty leagues below the preceding.\r\n\r\nThe Piratini forms itself in the vicinity of the said serra, passes\r\na short distance from St. Miguel, and runs into the Uruguay a little\r\nbelow St. Nicolau.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--The Brazilian pine and the cedar are not numerous.\r\nThe cotton tree, the _matte_, and mandioca, also Indian corn,\r\nwheat, potatoes, with other edible roots, are cultivated; likewise,\r\ngourds, water-melons, pine-apples, and divers hortulans; and, among\r\nfruit trees, the orange, _pitangua_, and peach.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--The animals, both domestic and wild, are the same as\r\nthose of the adjoining provinces.\r\n\r\nThe Tappes are a horde of Guaranis, which separated from the latter\r\nin former times, and lived for a long period upon the banks of the\r\nhigher Paranna, where they were at times invaded by the others. It is,\r\nhowever, certain that they occupied the southern part of this province\r\nwhen the Jesuits began to have a knowledge of them. They were esteemed\r\na people, not only less vicious than all other tribes in South America,\r\nbut the best disposed to receive the evangelical law, most constant\r\nafter having embraced it, and the best adapted to honour Christianity.\r\nThese people lived divided into various villages, of which the most\r\npopulous had the name of the nation. It is not known what were the\r\nnumber of those villages, which the Jesuits reduced to seven; and\r\non this account were denominated _reduçōes_, or reductions,\r\nalso missions. The names of these seven celebrated missions, are the\r\nfollowing, with the number of inhabitants in each at the period of\r\ntheir conquest by the Portuguese in 1801:--\r\n\r\n                             INHABITANTS.\r\n    St. Francisco de Borja      1,300\r\n    St. Miguel                  1,900\r\n    St. Joam                    1,600\r\n    St. Angelo                  1,960\r\n    St. Nicolau                 3,940\r\n    St. Lourenço                  960\r\n    St. Luiz                    2,350\r\n\r\nSt. Francisco de Borja, which is the most southern, is two miles\r\ndistant from the Uruguay, and five leagues from the confluence of\r\nIbicui. It suffered much by an invasion from the Minuanos, a little\r\nbefore changing its dominion. It has many white people.\r\n\r\nSt. Miguel, situated twenty-five leagues distant from the Uruguay,\r\nand thirty east-north-east from St. Borja, is the most easterly, and\r\nis considered the capital of the province. A great portion of it was\r\nconsumed by fire, which its inhabitants set to it in 1756, when they\r\nsaw the combined armies arriving in order to deliver the province up to\r\nthe Portuguese crown.\r\n\r\nSt. Joam is three leagues north of St. Miguel. Its mother church is in\r\nthe centre of a vast square. In the time of its prosperity it had forty\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nSt. Angelo, which is the most northerly, is six leagues to the north of\r\nSt. Joam.\r\n\r\nSt. Nicolau, formerly capital of the various reductions upon the right\r\nbank of the Uruguay, is situated near that river and a small brook\r\nwhich falls into the Paratini.\r\n\r\nSt. Lourenço is six leagues to the west of St. Miguel.\r\n\r\nSt. Luiz is upon the road which goes from St. Lourenço to St. Nicolau,\r\nnine leagues to the east of the latter place, and ten to the west\r\nof the former. All these reductions, otherwise missions, and which\r\nwe ought to call towns, as they have a senate, took the name of the\r\npatron of their mother churches. The whole were and yet are upon the\r\nsame plan, the houses of earth, with straight streets, and verandas on\r\nthe sides, which protect them against the rain and heat, similar to\r\nthe missions of the Paranna, with which in equal steps they reached a\r\nflourishing condition, and fell with them into a state of decay.\r\n\r\nEach place has its peculiar Guaranitic dialect, differing little\r\nfrom the others. Many of these Indians understand the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese, and express themselves tolerably well in both languages.\r\nThey exercise almost all the requisite manual occupations and various\r\nmechanical arts with intelligence; likewise manufacture coarse woollens\r\nand cottons. Matte is the only article of exportation.\r\n\r\nIn each mission, when governed by the Jesuits, there was a school for\r\nreading, writing, and speaking the Spanish language by royal order.\r\nThere were many Indians who could read Spanish books which they did not\r\nunderstand, as the masters or curates artfully refrained from uttering\r\na word to them, but in Guaranitic. In consequence of which, these\r\ncrafty preceptors were charged to fulfil the royal determination, by a\r\ndecree of 1743, but which decree had not the desired effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n                      PROVINCE OF ST. CATHARINA.\r\n\r\n   _Boundaries--Colonization--Productions--Mountains--\r\n   Mineralogy--Phytology--Zoology--Rivers, Lakes, and\r\n   Ports--Towns, Parishes, &c.--Agricultural\r\n   Establishments--Population--Islands--Delightful Climate._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis province, which is a dismemberment of that of St. Paulo,\r\nsubsequent to the latter receiving the addition of a part of St.\r\nAmaro and of St. Vincente, comprehends the island which gives it the\r\nname, and a territory of sixty leagues from north to south on the\r\nneighbouring continent, reckoning from the Sahy, which separates it\r\nfrom St. Paulo on the north, to the Mampituba, which divides it from\r\nthe province of Rio Grande on the south; on the west it has the same\r\nprovinces, the heads of the cordillera, running parallel with the sea,\r\nconstituting a boundary on that side. Its greatest width does not\r\nexceed twenty leagues, occupying the Beira-Mar, or sea-coast, of the\r\ngreatest portion of the ci-devant capitania of St. Amaro; and lying\r\nbetween 25° 50′, and 29° 20′ south latitude.\r\n\r\nA period of one hundred and twenty years elapsed without the donatories\r\nestablishing any colonists in the island of St. Catharina, which, for\r\nsome time had the name of Isle of Patos. King John IV. gave it, in the\r\nyear 1654, to Francisco Dias Velho, who was assassinated by an English\r\npirate at the time the establishment began. In consequence of this\r\ndisaster, the island long remained in its primitive state. Eventually,\r\nvarious colonists from the Azores were established in it, at the cost\r\nof the crown.\r\n\r\nThe climate is delightfully temperate and salubrious, with the\r\nexception of certain marshy situations. The face of the country is\r\nmountainous, watered by numerous rivers, and overspread with woods. The\r\nsoil is fertile and well adapted to the culture of mandioca, Indian\r\ncorn, rice, sugar, coffee, flax, and vegetables. Wheat and barley are\r\nlikewise grown in some districts. All the hortulans of the south of\r\nEurope prosper here, particularly onions.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--Camberella, which is upon the southern entrance of\r\nthe port of the capital, is the highest mountain seen from Santo to\r\nthe _Torres_[18] or Towers. The mountain of Bahul is a land-mark\r\nfor navigators.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Calcareous stones, granite, _pedras d’amolar_, or\r\nwhetstone. It is said there are indications of gold and other metals.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--The oak tree is here more diversified than in the mother\r\ncountry, and excellent for building. The sassafras, cedar, _loiro_,\r\n_pau d’arco_, and those called _guarabu_ and _grapecique_, are trees\r\nof precious wood, well adapted for cabinet work; likewise the tree\r\ndenominated here _pau d’oleo_, having the grain close and nicely\r\nwaved. The Brazilian pine is numerous in various districts. There are\r\na diversity of medicinal plants; likewise the plant that nurtures the\r\ncochineal, which has been fully described by many writers. It is an\r\ninsect, and feeds upon the leaves of the _opuncia_; its size is so\r\ndiminutive at first, that it scarcely can be seen, but it soon moves\r\nand fixes upon a part of the plant, from which it does not remove, and\r\nbecomes gradually covered with a white skin, so that the body, which is\r\nscarlet, is no longer seen. In three months it arrives at maturity, and\r\nis not larger than a small pea; there are various modes of cultivating\r\nit, and great care is required to keep off other insects which destroy\r\nit. This is an article of considerable commerce and might be cultivated\r\nto a great extent in the Brazil.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--Cattle do not abound in consequence of the mountainous nature\r\nof the country. Amongst other wild quadrupeds, are well known the\r\ndeer, the _tamandua_, the monkey, the boar, the _ounce_, the _anta_,\r\nthe _paca_, and the _quaty_. Amongst numerous species of birds are\r\nremarked the parrot, the macuco partridge, the _rola_, or turtle, the\r\n_guara_, and various sorts of the humming bird called _colibri_, or\r\n_beija-flor_. The lakes abound with wild ducks and geese. An infinite\r\nvariety of beautiful butterflies are seen in this province, to delight\r\nthe eye, and engage the research of the naturalist. The air appears\r\nfilled with floating flowers.\r\n\r\nRIVERS, LAKES, AND PORTS.--The first are generally of a short\r\nextent. About three miles north-north-east of the Towers is the mouth\r\nof the Mampituba, about one hundred fathoms wide, which was called for\r\nsome time the Martim Affonso. It is not more than seven leagues long,\r\nbeing formed of various streams that descend from the cordillera; its\r\ncurrent is violent, but sumacas, or smacks, ascend with the tide twelve\r\nmiles to the port of Forquilhas. By its northern margin it receives\r\nthe waters of a lake, which is about five leagues long, and one\r\nbroad, extending parallel with the sea-coast as far as the Campos das\r\nLagoinhas, from thence it has another outlet to the sea, by a channel\r\ncalled Arroyo Grande.\r\n\r\nNear the situation denominated the Conventos, there is a serro of rock\r\nmoderately elevated, and terminating in a platform near the beach,\r\nabout six leagues distant from the Mambituba. Six miles further, the\r\nriver Ararangua enters the sea, and is navigable for the space of five\r\nleagues to the Tres Portos, where it is one hundred fathoms wide, and\r\ndeeper than at the bar, having a rapid current from the month of June\r\nto September. Three leagues beyond the preceding, the river Urussanga\r\ndisembogues, being more extensive, and much more rapid when its waters\r\nare high; no vessel can enter its mouth, in consequence of the sea\r\nbreaking with great violence upon a bank which crosses it. Higher\r\nup it is wider, and has four fathoms of depth in some places. This\r\nriver communicates with a large and deep lake, where the _boto_\r\nand other large fish are seen, which come up from the ocean; it lies\r\nnorthward of the river. Five leagues further is the rock of St. Martha,\r\nwhere the coast changes its direction to the north. Three leagues to\r\nthe north of the Morro, or rock of St. Martha, is the spacious bay\r\nof Laguna, formerly the river Da Lagoa, (of the Lake) which is the\r\nmouth of the river Tubarao, and together the outlet of various lakes,\r\nprolonged in a chain parallel with the ocean, and at no considerable\r\ndistance from it. This river rises in the serra that bounds this\r\nprovince, and its current is rapid from April to September. Canoes\r\nproceed up it a distance of eight or nine leagues to Porto da Guarda;\r\nbut _sumacas_ do not pass the mouth of the river Capibary, which\r\njoins it by the left bank, and is navigable for a space of eight\r\nleagues to Pouzo Alto. On the northern margin of the Tubarao is the\r\noutlet of the great lake Laguna, which is five leagues long from north\r\nto south, near two at the greatest width, and is of sufficient depth\r\nfor sumacas, as far as its northern extremity. On the southern bank\r\nof the Tubarao, in front of the outlet of the Laguna, is that of the\r\nlake of St. Martha, which lake is a quarter of a league square. On its\r\nsouthern side the lake Garopaba discharges itself, is about the same\r\nsize, and one league distant. Into the latter the outlet of the lake\r\nJaguaruna disembogues, which is two leagues further to the southward,\r\nand a little larger. The three together afford a passage to large\r\ncanoes, as far as the river Congonhas, which is not considerable, and\r\nempties itself into the western margin of the latter lake. They are\r\ncomprehended under the name of the lakes of Camacho, and abound in\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nOn the western side of the Laguna, and near its northern extremity, the\r\nriver Una discharges itself, and affords navigation to canoes for some\r\nleagues, as far as the rock of St. Joam. An arm of this river extends a\r\nleague and a half to the north, is deep, and terminates in a morass.\r\n\r\nIn front of the embouchure of the Laguna is the small island of Lobos.\r\nFour leagues to the north is the point and port of the Embituba, and\r\ntwo farther is the mouth of the river Piraquera, which is the outlet of\r\nthe lake of the same name, otherwise Encantada, four miles long and one\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nContinuing onward, the river Embahu is met with, which at its mouth is\r\nonly eight fathoms wide, but it gradually increases to more than eighty\r\nfathoms; canoes can proceed up during a day’s voyage.\r\n\r\nTwo miles farther to the north is the point of Pinheira, which is\r\nfollowed by the gulf of the same name, being the southern entrance to\r\nthe channel of the island of St. Catharina; its southern extremity is a\r\nleague to the north of the said point.\r\n\r\nNear six miles to the north of Point Pinheira, the Massambu\r\ndisembogues, being thirty fathoms wide, and of considerable depth, but\r\nof short extent: Rio Dom Rodrigo was its first designation. After it\r\nfollows a small bay, called Brito, and a little farther is the entrance\r\nof the river Cubatao, sixty fathoms wide, up which larger canoes\r\nproceed during two days’ voyage. In the proximity of this river there\r\nare various fountains of hot water, having different degrees of heat:\r\nthe most distant one, situated five leagues up the river, possesses one\r\nhundred and two degrees.\r\n\r\nAfter passing various small rivers, the river Maruhy is met with, as\r\nlarge as the preceding one, and navigable to the place denominated\r\nGuarda. Near this river is the bay of St. Joze. A little to the north\r\nis a straight, which divides the channel into two almost equal parts;\r\nand a little farther is the entrance of the river Biguassu, fifty\r\nfathoms in width, and up which canoes proceed for many leagues. The\r\nfirst discoverers called it the river of Patos, in consequence of its\r\nconstituting a limit between the Indians of that name, who extended\r\nthemselves as far as the St. Pedro, and the Carijos to the north as far\r\nas Cannanea.\r\n\r\nThe large bay of St. Miguel follows; afterwards, the point of Armacao;\r\nand, farther on, that of Ganchos, which lies east and west of the\r\nextremity of the island of St. Catharina, and is to the southward of\r\nthe spacious bay of Tejucas, at the farther end of which the river\r\nof the same name discharges itself, being fifty fathoms wide, and\r\naffording two days’ navigation. The surrounding country of the bay of\r\nTejucas is a morass or marshy plain in the winter, when its passage is\r\nattended with great labour and inconvenience.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the preceding is the bay of Guaroupas, open to the\r\nnorth-east, not so large, but sufficiently sheltered and capacious for\r\nthe reception of a squadron of ships; the river Bupeba runs into it, as\r\nwell as the two Pireques. The intervening land of those two bays is a\r\npeninsula, which extends to the sea, terminating in three points, and\r\nforming two small bays.\r\n\r\nProceeding northward, the next river is the Cambory-Guassu, rapid at\r\nits entrance into the sea, and being twenty fathoms in width. Nearly\r\nthree leagues farther is the embouchure of the great river Tajahy,\r\nwhich is little less than sixty fathoms in width at the passage a short\r\ndistance from the beach. It is the only river met with on the road from\r\nPortalegre to St. Paulo that flows towards the east; the _sumacas_\r\nproceed up only three miles, launches and large canoes navigate freely\r\nas far as the first fall. About one hundred and twenty yards above it\r\nbecomes navigable for the space of three days, by towing, and as many\r\nmore with the oar, to the next cataract. It rises between the river\r\nNegro and the Correntes, (which run to westward.) In its neighbourhood\r\nthere are many small mountains. The principal confluents which enlarge\r\nit are the Rio de Luiz Alves (which comes from the north-west, runs\r\nnear the mountain of Bahul, seen from the sea at a great distance, and\r\nis navigable for small canoes) and the Tajahy Mirim, which runs from\r\nthe south-west, navigable for canoes about ten leagues. The whole flow\r\nthrough countries of great fertility.\r\n\r\nFive miles farther to the north is the river Gravata, otherwise\r\nIriri-Guassu, thirty fathoms wide, and navigable for canoes. It\r\nis followed by the spacious bay of Itapacoroya, where there is an\r\nestablishment for whale fishing. Proceeding onwards, the Iriri Mirim\r\nand the Camboriu are met with, up which canoes also navigate with the\r\naid of the tide. Near to the latter is the Tajuba, a river of a similar\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThree leagues to the north of the Itapacoroya the river Itapicu\r\ndisembogues, being fifty fathoms wide, and of considerable depth. Its\r\norigin is far back in the province, and affords navigation to small\r\ncanoes for many leagues, without the interruption of more than one\r\ncataract, which is situated ten miles above the mouth. The agitated\r\nstate of the sea at the mouth of this river does not permit the\r\nentrance of any description of vessel. Immediately beyond the bar it\r\nforms a lake, called Lagoa da Cruz, two leagues long from north to\r\nsouth, parallel with the beach, and very narrow. Among the rivers which\r\nenlarge it are remarked the Piranga, which is received by the left\r\nbank, and is navigable by canoes for a space of five leagues; the\r\nUpitanga, which joins it by the right margin, and is only navigable\r\nfor six miles; the Itapicu Mirim, that comes from the north-west and\r\nadmits of navigation for about fifteen miles; the Jaragua, which flows\r\nfrom the south-west, and appears capable of allowing small vessels to\r\nproceed as far as a situation about four leagues above its mouth; and\r\nthe Braço, which descends from the north-west, and admits of canoes for\r\nthe space of six miles. All these rivers run by winding courses among\r\nmountains and uncultivated territories, thickly wooded, demonstrating\r\nthe natural fertility of the soil. The Itapicu is supposed to be the\r\nriver of Dragons, which the discoverers placed to the south of the\r\nriver St. Francisco in this district.\r\n\r\nFive miles to the north of Itapicu is the island of St. Francisco, six\r\nleagues long, and in the form of a bow, the right line of which is\r\nnearest the coast; the channel which separates it from the continent\r\nis improperly called the river of St. Francisco. The southern entrance\r\nis denominated Aracary, is two hundred fathoms wide, has only depth\r\nfor large boats, and on its outside are the three islands of Remedios\r\nand two of Tamboretes. The northern bar, called Babitonga, is fifteen\r\nhundred fathoms wide and deep enough for large _sumacas_.[19]\r\nAt the end of the sixteenth century it was not known that the land\r\nbetween the bar of Aracary and Babitonga was an island; they were\r\nthought to be two mighty rivers, the southern called the St. Francisco\r\nand the northern the Alagado. The channel, or the pretended river St.\r\nFrancisco, of a semicircular form, enlarges considerably from both\r\nmouths to the middle, where it is three miles wide, and contains a\r\ncluster of more than twenty islands. A great number of rivers empty\r\nthemselves here. The nearest to the bar of Aracary is the Piraque,\r\nhaving a course of five leagues, five fathoms in width at the mouth,\r\nand affords navigation to canoes for three miles; next to it is the\r\nPinheiros, still smaller; then the Paraty, which is thirty fathoms\r\nwide at the bar, two and a half in depth, and navigable for about a\r\nleague. The little river Areas, narrow and deep, is navigable for two\r\nmiles. The great river Areas, up which canoes proceed with the tide\r\nfor some distance. The river Parannagua, whose origin approximates to\r\nthat of the Pirango, an arm of the Itapicu: coasting vessels proceed\r\nup it a short way, large boats about two miles, and canoes nearly five\r\nmiles. Next follow the Saguaçu; the two Erirys; the Cubatao Grande,\r\ntwenty fathoms wide, three deep, and navigable for ten leagues to the\r\nhigh rock of Tromba; the Antonio Felis; the Ribeyrao; the Biguaçu; the\r\nPyrabyréba; the Cavalinhos, by which canoes proceed for a space of ten\r\nmiles; the Tres-Barras, so called in consequence of being the common\r\nembouchure of the three rivers of Furtaenchente, St. Joam, and Tres\r\nBarras, the second only being considerable, (its principal confluents\r\nare the Maria Bachaara and the Farinhas, which come from the serra of\r\nCurytiba, and afford navigation to canoes;) the Barrancos, Bacuhy,\r\nLamen, Batuby, Fornos, Fernandes, Barboza, and the two Jaugarunas,\r\nthe smaller of which is nearest to the northern point of the bar of\r\nBabitonga. The nine last, and several of the others are small, being\r\nonly of any note during the spring tides. The whole of these rivers\r\ngenerally run tamely between low banks, of a marshy nature, abounding\r\nwith considerable numbers of the beautiful scarlet _guara_ bird,\r\nwhich delight the eye of the navigators. In some of these rivers are\r\nfound seed pearls of various colours, also large pearls of an imperfect\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe island of St. Francisco is low, watered with various small rivers,\r\nand inhabited; on its eastern side there is a narrow lake, ten miles\r\nlong from north to south, denominated the river Acarahy; and near it\r\nanother small one. Two leagues north of the bar of Babitonga is the\r\nriver Sahy Mirim, and the same distance farther the Sahy Grande, both\r\ninconsiderable, uniting in one stream a little above their embouchures.\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of the population of this province is descended\r\nfrom families who came from the Azore Islands, for the purpose of\r\ncolonizing it. Negroes are not numerous, and mesticos still less so.\r\nThe aboriginal Patos, whose name the island at first had, penetrated\r\ninto the continent. The Carijos were the first tribe understood by\r\nthe Vincentistas, and hence their name was given in common to all\r\ndomesticated Indians, of whatever nation.\r\n\r\nThis province has three towns, _viz._\r\n\r\n    Nosso Senhora do Desterro, in the island of St. Catharina,\r\n    Laguna, on the continent,\r\n    St. Francisco, in the island of the same name;\r\n\r\nand seven parishes, namely,\r\n\r\n    St. Joze                       }\r\n    St. Miguel                     }\r\n    Nosso Senhora do Rozario       } on the continent;\r\n    Santa Anna                     }\r\n\r\n    Nosso Senhora da Conceiçao     }\r\n    Nosso Senhora da Lapa          } in the island of St. Catharina.\r\n    Nosso Senhora das Necessidades }\r\n\r\nThe hermitages are equal in number to the parishes.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, this province was computed to have\r\n\r\n     4,216 fogos, or houses.\r\n    23,865 adult inhabitants, exclusive of paid troops.\r\n         3 sugar engenhos, or works.\r\n       192 distilleries of rum.\r\n         4 engenhos for pounding rice.\r\n       297 wind and horse mills.\r\n       884 bolandeiras for grinding mandioca.\r\n        32 tan-pits.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1812, the population amounted to 31,530.\r\n\r\nISLANDS.--The only considerable islands are that which gives\r\nthe name to the province and that of St. Francisco. The island of St.\r\nCatharina, upwards of thirty miles long from north to south, and from\r\nfour to eight in width, is mountainous, abounding with water, yet in\r\nparts covered with woods, and does not want for stone or potters’\r\nearth. Between its mountains there are some cultivated plains, of\r\ngreater or less extent, and also many marshy situations. There are many\r\nbays, and they abound with shells. On the eastern side there is a lake\r\ntwo leagues long from north to south, deep in some places, and at a\r\ncertain part so contracted that it appears like two, united by a neck\r\nfifty fathoms wide, having a large bridge. When in the winter it begins\r\nto inundate the adjacent low grounds, the inhabitants in the vicinity\r\nopen a channel to discharge the overflowing water into a bay, situated\r\nat a little distance, and which is immediately filled up again by the\r\nflowing of the tide, when the current ceases, during which a great\r\nquantity of fish enter from the ocean. It consequently affords at all\r\ntimes an abundant supply. At its northern extremity, there is a small\r\nriver called Vermelho, near which the best water-melons of the province\r\nare produced. To the south of the preceding, there are three other\r\nlakes: the Lagoinha Grande, the Pantano, and the Lagoinha de Leste. The\r\nwhole are stored with the same fish as the first. Mandioca and flax are\r\nthe principal articles of agriculture, which is generally exercised by\r\nwhite men, who also cultivate Indian corn, rice, coffee, vegetables,\r\nsugar, and some cotton, which is not of good quality. Some fruit\r\ntrees from the south of Europe are here naturalized. Water-melons,\r\npine-apples, and oranges are very abundant. The principal streams in\r\nthis island are the Vermelho, the Ratones, which enters the sea two\r\nleagues north of the capital, and the Tavares, three miles south-east\r\nof the capital. The country, watered by the last river, produces the\r\nbest melons in the province.\r\n\r\nThe channel which separates this island from the continent is far from\r\nbeing of uniform width, forming two large ports, almost equal in size,\r\nand separated by a straight of two hundred fathoms between two points.\r\nThe northern and larger port, ten miles wide, having depth for ships of\r\nwar, is one of the best in South America, and the key to the southern\r\nocean. The wind prevails from the south during the winter, which\r\ncommences generally in May and ends in October. Thunder-storms are\r\nfrequent in the summer; all the afternoons here are refreshed by strong\r\nsea breezes, rendering the climate of this island equal to any in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nNear to the southern point of St. Catharina are six small islands. The\r\nthree western ones are called the Papagúos, and the eastern the Tres\r\nIsmaos. The islands of Moleques, Campeche, Xavier, Aranhas, and Badejo\r\nare situated upon the eastern coast of the island of St. Catharina.\r\nNear its northern point are three, called the Moleques. Five miles\r\nnorth of the same point are the islands of Arvoredo and Galle. Within\r\nthe principal port, amongst others, are the islands of Tomarim, near\r\nthe coast of the continent, and the Ratones, almost in front of the\r\nriver of the same name, both fortified. In the southern port are the\r\nislands of Cardos and Maruhy.\r\n\r\nThe town of Nosso Senhora do Desterro, the capital of the province,\r\nis considerable, populous, and situated on the western side of the\r\nisland of St. Catharina, upon a bay a little to the east-south-east of\r\nthe straight, on unequal land between two rocks, traversed by three\r\nsmall rivers, which are passed by various stone bridges. The streets\r\nare almost generally irregular, and the houses either of stone or\r\nwood. Besides a church, it has the chapels of Menino Deos, Our Lady of\r\nRozario, a Terceira order of St. Francisco d’Assis, and a hospital of\r\ncharity. The quarters of the troops are good. The senate is presided by\r\na _Juiz de Fora_, and the youth are instructed by royal masters in\r\nthe primitive letters and Latin, for whose benefit there is a tribute\r\nin rum. Potteries afford a branch of industry and commerce. Coarse\r\ncloths of linen and cotton, also a mixture of both, are manufactured.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Nosso Senhora das Necessidades, better known by the name\r\nof St. Antonio, is five miles north of the capital, and small, but its\r\nsituation is particularly pleasant. The inhabitants cultivate sugar,\r\nmandioca, Indian corn, some flax, and various hortulans. A little more\r\nthan three miles to the north is the bay Das Canavieiras (of canes or\r\nreeds.) Here the Spaniards disembarked in 1777, and took possession of\r\nthe island without the least resistance.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Nosso Senhora da Conceiçao is situated about a league\r\nto the east of the capital, upon a steep, a little distant from the\r\nlarge lake, enjoying an extensive view of the ocean. Its parishioners\r\ncultivate sugar and mandioca, with the other provisions of the country.\r\nIn this district there is an establishment for whale fishing.\r\n\r\nTwo leagues to the south of the capital is the parish of Nosso Senhora\r\nda Lapa, situated near the mouth of a small river, in the recess of\r\na semicircular bay, and in front of an island. It is commonly called\r\n_Robeira_, has abundance of fish, and the provisions of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nLaguna is a middling town, advantageously situated upon the eastern\r\nmargin of the lake from which it derives the name. It is two miles\r\nfrom the bar, near a small hill, from whence descend excellent waters.\r\nThe form of this place is quadrilateral, with three parallel streets,\r\ncrossed by others, and a square at one side, in which the municipal\r\nhouse is situated. It has only one church, dedicated to St. Antonio\r\ndos Anjos, and a great part of the houses are of stone, some one story\r\nhigh, and whitened with the lime of shells. The inhabitants cultivate\r\nthe usual productions of the country. The lake is stored with fish,\r\nand in the months of November and December a prodigious quantity of\r\n_bagre_ (a long fish with a forked tail) enter it, supplying a\r\nlucrative branch of commerce. This town is sixty miles south of the\r\ncapital. From its port, which receives coasting vessels, is exported\r\nfarinha, rice, Indian corn, timber, and salt fish.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen miles north of Laguna, and near fifty south of the\r\ncapital, is the parish of St. Anna, commonly known by the name of\r\nVilla Nova, a small place, pleasantly situated upon an elevation near\r\nthe northern extremity of the same lake, with two ports, one called\r\nPorto da Embituba, sheltered on the south and east by a headland\r\nof the same name, where there is a small whale fishery, subject to\r\nthe administration of that of Garopaba. The houses are generally of\r\nwood, although there is abundance of stone. Its inhabitants, amongst\r\nwhom there are many _macilentos_, (meagre or spare,) cultivate\r\nthe productions common to the country, and a large quantity of flax,\r\nhaving, consequently, more weavers of that article than any other\r\nplace in the province. Onions are of an extraordinary size, and other\r\nhortulans of a fine quality.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Nosso Senhora do Rozario, which is upon the bay of Brito,\r\nbetween two small brooks, thirty-five miles north of St. Anna, and ten\r\nsouth of the capital, is yet small, and its parishioners cultivate\r\nmandioca, Indian corn, and sugar, and also are fishermen. In its\r\ndistrict there are hot springs.\r\n\r\nFour miles to the south-east of the capital, and one distant from the\r\nleft bank of the Maruhy, is the parish of St. Joze, upon a bay of the\r\nsame name, with a pottery of glazed earthenware. The inhabitants grow\r\nthe same articles as the preceding.\r\n\r\nEight miles north-west of the capital is the pleasant parish of St.\r\nMiguel, upon a bay so called, which forms a good roadstead. Its\r\ninhabitants cultivate and export a large quantity of rice and farinha,\r\nwith some sugar. Near this place is the principal establishment for\r\nwhale fishing.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Francisco is of middling size, well supplied with fish\r\nand the provisions of the country, with houses mostly built of earth,\r\nand a handsome church of stone, dedicated to Our Lady da Graca. It is\r\nupon the western beach of the island of that name, about ten miles\r\nwithin the bar of Babitonga, upon level ground, and in a situation well\r\ncalculated for commerce. Only two streets are paved. The inhabitants,\r\ngenerally whites, are very pale, and almost all farmers of mandioca.\r\nThe cultivation of Indian corn, rice, sugar, coffee, and tobacco,\r\nwhich might be considerable, is at present very trifling. There are\r\nfew persons who do not possess at least one canoe. Vessels are built\r\nhere of good burden. Timber and cordage of _imbe_ are the most\r\nimportant exportations next to farinha (flour of mandioca.)\r\n\r\nThis province, which makes a part of the bishopric of Rio de Janeiro,\r\nwas till recently under the jurisdiction of the ouvidor of Portalegre,\r\nbut is now governed by Senhor Alexandre Eloi Portelli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n                        PROVINCE OF ST. PAULO.\r\n\r\n   _Boundaries--First Settlement--Mountains--Mineralogy--Rivers\r\n   and Ports--Islands--Phytology--Zoology--Bugre Indians, Dwellings\r\n   and Customs--Character of the Paulistas--Division into\r\n   Comarcas--Comarca of Curytiba--Towns and Productions--Comarcas\r\n   of St. Paulo and Hitu--Towns and Productions._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis province, formed by the union of a part of the capitania of St.\r\nAmaro, with one half of that of St. Vincente, took the name which\r\ndesignates it in the year 1710, when John V. incorporating them with\r\nthe crown lands by purchase, nominated a governor, with the title of\r\ncaptain-general, in the person of Antonio de Albuquerque Coelho, and\r\nthe city of St. Paulo for his residence. It is confined on the north\r\nby the province of Minas Geraes, from which the serra of Mantiqueira\r\nseparates it, and by that of Goyaz, from which it is divided by the\r\nriver Grande; on the south by Rio Grande do Sul, of which the river\r\nPellotas forms the division; on the west by the river Paranna, which\r\nseparates it from the provinces of Goyaz and Matto Grosso; and on the\r\neast by the ocean, and the provinces of Rio de Janeiro on the northern\r\npart, and St. Catherina on the southern. Its territory is almost all\r\nwithin the temperate zone, between 20° 30′ and 28° south latitude,\r\ncomprising four hundred and fifty miles from north to south, and\r\nthree hundred and forty miles of medium width from east to west; and\r\npossessing much variety in the climate, soil, and aspect of the country.\r\n\r\nJohn III. determining to divide the Brazilian coast into capitanias,\r\nat the period that Martim Affonso de Souza was in this new region,\r\npresented him, in 1532, with one comprising a hundred leagues of coast,\r\nand his brother Pedro Lopez de Souza, who had accompanied him, with\r\nanother of fifty; but the letter of donation to Martim Affonso was not\r\nsigned till the 20th of January, 1535, at the time when he had already\r\ntaken his departure for India. It specified that this captaincy, which\r\nafterwards took the name of St. Vincente, should extend from the river\r\nMaccahe as far as twelve leagues to the southward of the island of\r\nCannanea, where the bar of Paranagua is situated, excepting a certain\r\nportion of ten leagues, computed from the river Curupace, now called\r\nJiquiriquere, to that of St. Vincente. The capitania of Pedro Lopez de\r\nSouza, which was denominated St. Amaro, included the said ten leagues.\r\nThat of St. Vincente had scarcely existed forty years, when it was\r\ndeprived of half its territory, for the purpose of creating the new one\r\nof Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nWith the change of possessors, the southern limits of both capitanias\r\ndisappeared, and the jurisdiction of the governors began to extend by\r\ndegrees over the countries which now constitute the provinces of Minas\r\nGeraes, Goyaz, Matto Grosso, St. Catharina, and Rio Grande do Sul,\r\nwhere, through the adventures of the Paulistas, colonies were first\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\nThe authority of Herrera would warrant the conclusion that there was a\r\nfactory at St. Vincente in the year 1527. At all events, the licence\r\nwhich Martim Affonso conceded to Pedro Goes, on the 3d of March, 1533,\r\nfor the purpose of exporting seventeen captive Indians, free of all\r\nduties which it was customary to pay, amply demonstrates that such an\r\nestablishment had existed for some time previous to the latter year.\r\nMartim Affonso found here, as has been already observed, two Europeans,\r\nAntonio Rodrigues, and John Ramalho, whom Herrera imagined had escaped\r\nfrom some shipwreck upon the coast; but it would seem improbable that\r\nthey could of themselves have constituted a factory; as establishments\r\nof that kind, formed amongst barbarians, necessarily require a\r\nconsiderable number of persons.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--This province is not mountainous, if we except\r\nthe eastern part, in the whole extent of which there is a general\r\ncordillera, running parallel to the coast, which occasionally receives\r\nthe name of Cubatam. This serra is not universally of the same\r\naltitude, neither does it run uniformly at an equal distance from the\r\nsea. It has many broken parts, by some of which torrents descend to the\r\nocean, and others wind into the interior. It abounds in verdant woods,\r\nbeing generally high towards the sea, and is the most elevated land of\r\nthe province, with the exception of some dispersed mountains in the\r\ninterior; besides, the largest rivers which irrigate this district have\r\ntheir origin in it, and run westward.\r\n\r\nThe serra Araassoiava, by corruption Guarassoiava, which signifies the\r\neclipsing of the sun, alluding to the great extent of land obscured by\r\nits shade, previously to the sun’s departure. This mountain, which is\r\nten miles in length, and of proportionate width, consists entirely of\r\na pure mineral of iron, and is situated in the district of the town of\r\nSorocaba.\r\n\r\nThe mount of Araquara, from which are frequent exhalations, and which\r\nis reputed to contain gold, is situated upon the right margin of the\r\nTiete, thirty miles below the embouchure of the Piracicaba. This\r\nmountain must not be confounded with a serra of the same name, which\r\nexists more in the centre of the province.\r\n\r\nNear the head of the Jaguariquatu, is the elevated mount of\r\nPirapirapuan, which is discovered at a great distance, and possesses\r\ngold. The mountain of Thaho, upon the margin of the Thajahi, is also\r\nhigh, and yields the same metal.\r\n\r\nThe serra Dourada is situated in the campo of Guarapuaba, to the west\r\nof the Tibagi. The serra of Apucaranna, is also in the plains of\r\nGuarapuaba.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the sea is to be remarked Mount Cardozo, on the left\r\nof the entrance to the bay of Cannanea. Mount Jurea, by corruption\r\nJudea, receives this name in consequence of its appearing like Judea\r\nto the travellers, who cannot pass the road leading over the summit\r\nwithout much fatigue. It is a few leagues to the north of the river\r\nIguape, is high, commands an extensive view, and precipitates various\r\ntorrents, amongst which the river Yerde is conspicuous, forming several\r\ncascades.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Jaguary, which is between the rivers Itanhaen and Una,\r\nnear the beach, is in great part composed of stone, with trees of more\r\nthan ordinary magnitude.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--There are mines of gold, silver, brass, iron, brimstone,\r\npumice-stone, flint, magnet, calcareous stone, granite, _amolar_, or\r\ngrindstone, potters’ earth, rubies, diamonds, and a diversity of other\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND PORTS.--None of the maritime provinces, with the exception\r\nof that of Para, present so many navigable rivers, notwithstanding\r\nthe most important are incapable of conducting the productions of the\r\ncentral districts of the country to the ports of the sea, the whole\r\nflowing in a contrary direction to the westward, and are swallowed\r\nup by the Paranna; but even the produce of the western districts, if\r\nagriculture should at any future epoch flourish there, cannot descend\r\nby the Paranna, in consequence of the Seven Falls, (Setequedas). It\r\nmight, however, be conveyed over land to the point where the river\r\nbecomes navigable, and from thence to the ports, by overcoming other\r\nobstacles in the imperfect mode already practised in these parts.\r\n\r\nThe principal rivers of this province are the Paranna, the Iguassu, the\r\nParannapanema, and the Tiete.\r\n\r\nThe Paranna takes this name at the confluence of the Paranahyba, which\r\ncomes from the centre of Goyaz, and the Rio Grande, which issues from\r\nthe interior of Minas Geraes, both considerable. After a course of\r\nmany leagues, and having gathered various streams by both margins, it\r\nforms a large and interesting fall denominated Urubu Punga, which is\r\nan insurmountable barrier to all sorts of fish; and, consequently,\r\nthere are in its vicinity immense shoals of divers kinds, which may\r\nbecome a lucrative branch of commerce to the future dwellers near this\r\nmagnificent cascade, which produces a loud murmur that is heard at the\r\ndistance of many leagues.\r\n\r\nA little below it, the river Cururuhy discharges itself, flows from the\r\ninterior of Goyaz, and traverses the territory of the Cayapos. About\r\nten miles lower, it receives the waters of the important river Tiete,\r\nin front of which embouchure there are two islands, each about ten\r\nmiles long.\r\n\r\nSeven miles further, the river Sucurihu enters it by the western bank,\r\nbelow the mouth of which there is a dangerous current, called Jupia.\r\n\r\nFive miles lower, the island of Comprida (Long Island) commences,\r\nwhich is upwards of twenty miles in extent; and eight miles below its\r\nsouthern extremity, the river Aguapehi flows into the Paranna, on the\r\nleft margin; and fifteen miles further, the Verde, on the western\r\nside, in front of its mouth, there are two parallel islands, neither\r\nexceeding a league in length.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles below the preceding tributary, the small river Onca\r\nenters it by the same margin; and about fifty miles further, it is\r\nincreased by the Pardo, which also enters on the right, and affords a\r\ncommunication to Camapuan.\r\n\r\nFive miles below this confluence is that of the inconsiderable river\r\nSt. Anastaçio, which flows from the east. Eighty miles further, the\r\nParannapanema enters, opposite the mouth of which there is an island\r\nabout seven miles in extent: four miles beyond its southern point,\r\nanother commences, of ten miles in length; and a little below the\r\nlatter, a third, which is nearly thirty miles long. Three miles further\r\nthan the southern extremity of this island, the central mouth of the\r\nriver Ivinheyma is discovered, which flows from the west.\r\n\r\nThe Paranna is here little less than seven miles in width, and contains\r\na number of large islands. Near thirty miles below the Ivinheyma, the\r\nIvahi discharges, flowing hither in a westerly direction, and six miles\r\nbeyond its mouth, is an island near fifteen miles long; in front of its\r\ncentre, the Amambahy contributes its volume to the Paranna, after a\r\ncourse from the westward.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the last isle, is the island of Grande, or Large\r\nIsland, not being much less in extent than seventy miles, and of\r\nconsiderable width; it terminates four miles above the Seven Falls.\r\nA little more than seven miles above the southern point of this\r\nisland, the river Iguatimy enters the Paranna on the western margin,\r\nin latitude 24° 40′; and in a little higher latitude the Piquiry. Ten\r\nmiles to the south of the first, it receives, by the right bank, the\r\nsmall river Iguarei, nearest to the Seven Falls.\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of the Great Island, the current of the Paranna\r\nis much accelerated, and augments proportionably as its margins\r\napproximate; and from near four miles of width, which it retains in\r\nfront of the Iguarei, it diminishes to fifty fathoms, its immense\r\nvolume of waters being then divided into seven channels, formed by six\r\nsmall islands of rock, traversing the serra of Maracaju, with a current\r\nof indescribable fury and awful noise.\r\n\r\nBesides the islands already mentioned in this river, there are a vast\r\nnumber of others, of a smaller size, in the great space that intervenes\r\nbetween the Setequedas and the fall of Urubu Punga. Its waters are\r\nturbulent, and ill adapted for drinking. The western margin is flat,\r\nin part consisting of a large white sand, with a variety of precious\r\nstones, for the space of many leagues without interruption. The eastern\r\nbank is generally a little elevated; and both exhibit continued and\r\nextensive woods. Without any considerable windings, it runs between\r\nthe south and south-west, with a current generally slow and majestic;\r\nbut, when strong winds prevail, the waves are as tumultuous as those\r\nof the ocean. It abounds with various kinds of fish, some of which are\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nForty miles below the Seven Falls, the river Jaguare enters the Paranna\r\nby the left margin; and sixty miles further the considerable Iguassu.\r\nAt a considerable distance further, its direction is changed towards\r\nthe west, and enters the Paraguay in the latitude of 27° 20′. From the\r\nmission of Corpus upwards, aboriginal nations alone possess the vast\r\nterritory watered by this majestic river and its confluents.\r\n\r\nThe river Iguassu, which in the Brazilian language signifies “great\r\nwater,” has its principal source in the small river St. Joze, and\r\nwhen it traverses the royal road of Lages to Sorocaba, is already\r\nconsiderable, and runs under the name of Curytiba. Its course is\r\nalways towards the west, having few windings, forming many falls,\r\nwhich interrupt navigation; sensibly enlarging by those streams which\r\nunite themselves with it on one or the other margin, principally the\r\nsouthern, and limiting on the south the vast plains of Guarapuaba,\r\ninhabited by Indians. The borders are extensively wooded. The first\r\nlarge fall, denominated Cayacanga, is about fifteen miles below the\r\nabove-mentioned road, and the largest ten miles above its embouchure,\r\nwhere it is one hundred and thirteen fathoms in width. This latter\r\ncataract is two hundred feet in perpendicular height; the margins\r\nof the river at this place are rocky, and the current furious. A\r\n_certanista_, (a commandant of a troop proceeding into the certam\r\nor interior,) who descended by this river, says, that it is navigable,\r\nwithout embarrassment, from Cayacanga to the fall of Victoria; but\r\nhe does not declare the extent of this interval, nor the names and\r\nsituations of seven large falls, which he encountered to the confluence\r\nof this river with the Paranna. At the angle of its confluence,\r\nfor some years existed the aldeia of St. Maria de lguassu, which\r\ndisappeared in consequence of a famine.\r\n\r\nWhat may be deemed the most remarkable object in this river, besides\r\nthe large fall alluded to, is that part of its course known by the\r\nappellation of the Funil, in the centre of the country, where it runs\r\nrapidly, contracted between high and pointed rocks, in the form of a\r\nstreet of medium width. In its vicinity dwell a horde of Puri and of\r\nGuayanha Indians. The principal confluents of the lguassu, which unite\r\nthemselves with it on the left, are the Negro, Varge, Bannanal, and St.\r\nAntonio, which joins it seventy miles above the last fall. Fifty miles\r\nabove the river St. Antonio, the Jordao discharges itself, and about\r\nthe same distance above the latter, the St. Joao, both by the right\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\nThe river Parannapanema has its origin in the cordillera of the sea, to\r\nthe west of the river Itanhaen. Its first considerable tributaries are\r\nthe Itapitininga, which joins it on the right, and the Apiahy on the\r\nleft, with the waters of which it becomes considerable and wide. Its\r\nmargins are generally flat, and covered with large trees; in some parts\r\nplains or campinhas are seen, where are encountered, amongst other\r\nwild creatures, the emu ostrich and deer. The current is principally\r\nquick, in consequence of numerous falls. Malevolent Indians occupy the\r\nadjacent lands. Near the southern margin, in the vicinity of the mouth\r\nof the Tibagy, some years ago was found the remains of a dwelling,\r\nwhich renders it probable that the ancient Spaniards of the province of\r\nGuayra extended their establishments to this river.\r\n\r\nThirty miles above the embouchure of the Parannapanema, it is joined\r\non the southern bank by the small river Pirapo, near the mouth of\r\nwhich, for many years, existed the _redução_ or mission of the\r\nLady of Loreto, one of thirteen which formed the reputed provinces of\r\nTaiaoba and Taiaty, so inaptly described by the Jesuit Montoya, one of\r\ntheir founders, and which affords room to suspect that they existed in\r\nthe vast territory which extends itself from the said Parannapanema\r\nnorthwards.\r\n\r\nThe river Tiete, formerly Anhemby, a name given to it by an Indian\r\ntribe, has its source seventy miles to the east of the city of St.\r\nPaulo, not far from which it passes; about four miles below it\r\nreceives, on the left margin, the Pinheiros, which flows from the\r\nsouth-east with twenty miles of course. After forty-five miles more\r\nit receives, on the right, the Jundiahy, which flows by the town of\r\nits name. Near this confluence, the Tiete forms a large cataract,\r\nwhich impedes the further advance of fish; and fifty miles further the\r\nCapibary joins it, after having traversed an extensive wood of majestic\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nEight miles lower the Sorocaba discharges on the left margin.\r\nOriginating in the serra of Cubatam, to the west of St. Vincente, it\r\nruns by the town of the same name.\r\n\r\nFifty miles beyond the preceding river, the Pirassicaba, which is\r\nconsiderable, enters it on the right, and is formed by the Tybaia and\r\nJaguary, the heads of which are situated to the north-east of St.\r\nPaulo, and traverse a vast wood of immense trees, from the trunks of\r\nwhich, as well as those that grow upon the borders of the aforesaid\r\nCapibary, are constructed canoes of eighty palms in length, nearly\r\neight in width, and five in height, which serve to navigate to Cuiaba,\r\nand carry four hundred arrobas of cargo, besides the necessary\r\nmaintenance for eight men, and occasionally passengers.\r\n\r\nA little below this confluence, where the volume of water is almost\r\ndoubled, the Lancoes joins it on the left; and, after four or five\r\ndays of voyage, the embouchure of the Jacare-Papira is met with on\r\nthe right; and, somewhat lower, that of the Pipira, on the same side,\r\nalmost as voluminous as the one which receives it. This river is\r\nformed by the waters of the Mugy, which originates in the skirt of the\r\nMantiqueira and of the Jaguary-Mirim, which issues from Minas Geraes,\r\nboth crossing the road from St. Paulo to Goyaz, thirty miles distant\r\none from the other. They flow westward for a considerable space,\r\nuniting in the centre of a large wood, through which they continue in\r\none important current, gathering various streams, that render it so\r\nconsiderable at the confluence mentioned.\r\n\r\nA few leagues below the passage to Goyaz there is a fall in the Mugy,\r\nwhich arrests the further progress of fish, and, in consequence, at a\r\ncertain period annually a numerous band of fishermen assemble here,\r\nwith _cargas_ (horse loads) of salt, which enables them to furnish\r\nthe more distant places, from the abundant draughts with which they are\r\nhere supplied.\r\n\r\nNavigators compute two hundred and fifty miles from Port Feliz to\r\nthe mouth of the Pipira, and as many more from this point to the\r\nconfluence of the Tiete with the Paranna.\r\n\r\nThe imperfect methods of overcoming the natural difficulties which\r\nare presented, require twenty-six days to accomplish this voyage of\r\nfive hundred miles. Its course is very winding; twenty-five miles are\r\nreckoned in a direct line from Port Feliz to the mouth of the Capibary,\r\nand nearly sixty by the river.\r\n\r\nIt is fifty miles from the mouth of the Jocoaquatu to that of the\r\nPirassicaba, and only twenty in a straight line. The bed is principally\r\nstony, with a great number of islands and falls, the most important\r\nof those precipitations are denominated Avare-Manduava, Itaguassava,\r\nPirapora, Bauru, Barery-Mirim, Barery-Guassu, Escaramuca, Utupanema,\r\nFunil-Grande, (the Large Funnel,) Guacurytuvussu, Aracanga-Mirim,\r\nAracangavussu, Utupeva, and Utupiru. The labour requisite to pass\r\nthese falls with canoes is very great. There are above sixty other\r\nplaces attended with difficulty, and half that number with considerable\r\ndanger, but which, notwithstanding, are passed without unloading the\r\ncanoes. The banks of this river are almost universally covered with\r\nsuperb timber. Amongst other fruit trees are the _jabuticaba_, quince,\r\n_cipota_, _jatahi_, _nhandipapo_, and _uvacupari_. From the bark of\r\nsome trees the aborigines and the certanistas construct canoes for\r\nthe purposes of navigation; and the resin extracted from them the\r\nIndians use for lights, and for ornaments for their ears and lips.\r\nAmong other species of fish it affords the _doirados_, _saupes_,\r\n_pacus_, _piracanjuvas_, _surubins_, _piracambucus_, _jahus_, and\r\n_piraquaxiaras_, some of which weigh two arrobas, or sixty-four pounds.\r\n\r\nIt would be of incalculable advantage to the internal provinces of\r\nBrazil if the government would adopt some effectual mode of diminishing\r\nthe numerous natural difficulties the Tiete presents to navigation. The\r\nvoyage is also prolonged in consequence of the fogs, which almost every\r\nmorning deter the canoes from departure till eight o’clock, when these\r\nmists usually disappear.\r\n\r\nThe river Tibagy, which originates to the west of Cannanea, runs to\r\nthe north-west, traversing the campos of Guarapuaba, where it becomes\r\nconsiderable from many other streams which join it, principally on\r\nthe right margin; among them are the Pitanguy, Yapo, Jaguaryhiba or\r\nJocuriahy, and the Jaguaryquatu. The Cairussu is the largest among the\r\nfew which it receives on the left, and passes near the serra Doirada.\r\nIt is navigable near to its heads, and enters the Parannapanema about\r\nthe middle of its course.\r\n\r\nBetween the Jaguariquatu and the aforesaid Apiahy travellers from\r\nVilla do Principe to Sorocaba pass, among other smaller streams, the\r\nTerere, Verde, and Taquary, which run universally towards the west,\r\nand increase the Tibagy, or the Parannapanema. The first and southern,\r\nwhen it crosses the road, is hidden by a high point of rock, formed by\r\nnature, and deemed one of the wonders of the province.\r\n\r\nThe Piquiry, having its heads in the centre of the campos of\r\nGuarapuaba, towards which it affords navigation for a very considerable\r\nspace, runs westward into the Paranna ten miles above the Seven Falls.\r\nIn the northern angle of its mouth, in an agreeable site, was situated\r\nCiudad Real, otherwise Guayra, demolished by the Paulistas in 1631. The\r\ndetachment of Fort Iguatimim attempted to rebuild it in 1773; but the\r\nundertaking was abandoned, in consequence of every individual employed\r\nhaving perished in a few days by a pestilential fever, which prevails\r\nhere in January, February, and March.\r\n\r\nThe Ivahy, originally Ubahy, which rises also in the campos of\r\nGuarapuaba and near to the Tibagy, from whence some certanistas\r\ntransport their canoes to it, is considerable, navigable nearly to its\r\norigin, and so well stored with fish, that it has also acquired the\r\nname of Rio do Peixe, (the River of Fish.) It runs between the west\r\nand north-west, traversing an extensive territory, peopled with savage\r\nIndians, and enters the Paranna.\r\n\r\nThe river Tinto, Bom, Soberbo, Capibary, and Thua are its principal\r\nbranches. The first is the northern and the last is the southern. The\r\nruins of Villa Rica, denominated Bannanal, are situated eight days’\r\nvoyage above its mouth, and was dismantled by the Paulistas upon the\r\nsame occasion on which they demolished Ciudad Real. A road connected\r\nthese two places, of which at the present day there is scarcely any\r\ntrace.\r\n\r\nThe Pardo issues from the comarca of St. Joao d’El Rey, where it washes\r\nthe arraial of its name; and after flowing through an extensive tract\r\nwestward, and collecting, amongst others, the river Araquara, falls\r\ninto the Rio Grande, much below the confluence of the Sapucahy, a\r\nconsiderable river, which travellers to Goyaz fall in with after they\r\nenter that province from St. Paulo.\r\n\r\nThe river Parahiba, after describing a vast winding, and irrigating\r\nmany povoacaos of this province, returns towards that of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, where it has its origin and termination.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe the rivers which flow towards the ocean, and the\r\nprincipal ports. These are Santos, Cannanea, and Paranagua.\r\n\r\nEighteen miles to the north of the river Sahy Grande, a limit of the\r\nprovince, is the mouth of the considerable and rapid Guaratuba, formed\r\nby others that descend from the General Cordillera. This name is\r\nderived from the beautiful guara bird, which abounds upon its margins,\r\nand breeds upon a flat island, covered with mangroves, situated about\r\nseven miles from the sea, where, by a decree, no one has been allowed\r\nto kill them, otherwise these handsome birds would have long since\r\nbeen extirpated. Launches proceed up to the town of the same name. Its\r\nlargest tributary is the river St. Joao, which, flowing a considerable\r\ndistance through the pine woods, unites itself with the Guaratuba on\r\nthe southern margin.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles to the northward are the three entrances to the bay of\r\nParanagua, formed by two islands. Ibupetuba, (or False Bar,) is the\r\nname of the southern, and Superagui that of the northern. The central\r\nand largest is five hundred fathoms in width. Mel is the name of the\r\nsouthern island, and Pecas the northern. This bay is twenty miles in\r\nlength from east to west, more than ten at its greatest width, and\r\nof very irregular form. The most northern portion is called the bay\r\nof Pine-trees, to which the island of Pecas opens two entrances. The\r\nisland of Cotinga, six miles long from east to west, and of small\r\nwidth, is the largest within this bay, where sumacas alone enter,\r\nand where a great number of rivulets and rivers are discharged. The\r\nmost considerable is the Cubatam, which flows into it at the western\r\nextremity. The Guaraquissava is the largest that enters it on the\r\nnorthern side, where it also receives the Serra Negra, the Cachoeira,\r\nand the Nhundyaquara. The Gurgussu and the Almeydas are the largest\r\nwhich run into this receptacle on its southern side.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles further, the river Ararapira disembogues, scarcely\r\nsupplying depth for canoes.\r\n\r\nTwelve miles to the north-east, which is the direction of the coast, is\r\nthe bar of Cannanea. Near its northern point there is a small elevated\r\nisland of the same name. In front of it, on the southern side, there is\r\nanother island called Figueira, which is round; and further outward is\r\nthat of Castilhos, small and of moderate elevation.\r\n\r\nForty miles in the same direction of north-east, is the bar of Icapara,\r\nthe northern mouth of an inlet of the sea, forming an island of the\r\nintervening land. Its southern mouth is the before-mentioned bar of\r\nCannanea. This island, hitherto unnamed, is flat, and of inconsiderable\r\nwidth, compared with its great length. It has some inhabitants, and the\r\nchannel which separates it from the continent is narrow and deep, and\r\nis sometimes called a bay, at others a lake. Smacks enter by the bar\r\nof Cannanea; that of Icapara, having the same depth, is not navigated,\r\nin consequence of its dangerous windings.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles further along the coast is the large outlet of the\r\nconsiderable river Iguape, formed by a great number of large streams,\r\ngenerally serpentine, and watering a vast and mountainous country,\r\nhaving gold. This river is navigable for many leagues; and in the\r\nvicinity of the sea, describing large windings, forms many peninsulas,\r\nsome of the isthmuses of which have been cut in order to shorten the\r\nnavigation. It passes about two miles from the town of Iguape.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles further are the two mouths of the river Una, up which\r\ncanoes proceed more than fifty miles, to a place called Prelado.\r\n\r\nForty miles to the north-east is the entrance of the bay of Itanhaen,\r\nwhich is handsome, and takes the name of a small river discharged at\r\nits extremity.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Santos follows at a distance of thirty-five miles, to which\r\nthe island of St. Vincente, and that of St. Amaro, originally Guahibe,\r\neach being fifteen or eighteen miles long, open three entrances.\r\nThe southern is denominated the bar of St. Vincente, the central\r\nBarra Larga, (Wide Bar,) or the bar of Santos, and the northern,\r\nBertioga, by corruption Buriquioca, which signifies a house or cavern\r\nof _buriquis_, a species of monkey. It is the only port of the\r\nprovince capable of receiving armadas. Various small rivers, alone\r\nnavigable with the tide, flow hither, and are discharged amidst\r\nmangroves.\r\n\r\nISLANDS.--The two last islands are the principal; are elevated, and\r\nabound with water, timber, and good stone.\r\n\r\nThe island of St. Amaro has scarcely any inhabitants, and is almost\r\nentirely uncultivated, which, perhaps, is owing to its not having\r\nbeen granted at first in small portions to agriculturists capable of\r\ncultivating it.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty miles to the east-north-east of St. Amaro, is the island\r\nof St. Sebastian, fifteen miles long, and proportionably wide, also\r\nhigh, with some inhabitants and roadsteads, being separated from the\r\ncontinent by the profound channel of Toque-Toque, a league in width.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles to the north-east from hence is the small island of\r\nPorcos, which is of a triangular form, with good anchorage in its\r\nvicinity, and inhabited.\r\n\r\nIn the same direction, and at an equal distance, the island of Couves\r\nis situated, possessing good water, and commodious anchorage on the\r\nside next the continent, from which it is distant three miles.\r\n\r\nThe Queimadas, consisting of three small islands, are situated twelve\r\nmiles east of the entrance to the bay of Itanhaen.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--This province possesses extensive woods, with a\r\nvariety of trees well adapted for building and other purposes. The\r\ncedar is common in many parts, and the Brazilian pine abounds more\r\nthan any other tree in many districts. It is of two sorts, the green,\r\nhigh and straight, and the white, which is not so compact as the\r\nfirst. Amongst other medicinal plants is the _jarrinha_, which\r\nis regarded as an efficacious antidote, applied externally, to the\r\nbite of a snake. The flowers of Europe do not degenerate much here;\r\nand fruit trees, transplanted from the same quarter, prosper equally\r\nwith a great portion of those peculiar to the central provinces. The\r\nproduce of the cotton tree is neither abundant nor of the best quality;\r\ncommon cottons, which are manufactured with it, constitute a branch of\r\ncommerce. The agricultural productions are wheat, rye, Indian corn,\r\nrice, mandioca, legumes, coffee, potatoes, sugar, rum, and tobacco;\r\nthese, with a large quantity of hides and pork, cattle, horses, mules,\r\npoultry, wax, precious stones, and drugs, are exported.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--Amongst other species of wild quadrupeds, the _capibara_,\r\nounce, _anta_, _tamandua_, _guara_, _preguica_, boar, deer, _paca_,\r\nmonkey, rabbit, wild dog, and _ariranha_, are common. European animals\r\nare sufficiently numerous, with the exception of the goat. A portion\r\nof salt is generally given to every species of cattle as aliment; and\r\nprobably no other province produces such a prodigious quantity of hogs.\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of this province was possessed by two nations,\r\ndenominated Carijos and Guayanas; the latter dwelt northward of the\r\nfirst. The western districts are yet in the power of the native\r\nbarbarians. The Paulistas give the appellation of _Bugres_ to those\r\nwhich inhabit the territory that extends from the river Tiete to the\r\nUruguay. The northern part is at this day occasionally visited by the\r\nCayapo tribes, whose dwelling places are on the other side of the\r\nParanna. The Bugres, amongst which there are some whites, with beards,\r\nare divided into four nations; one of these hordes perforate the under\r\nlip, some shave the head in the form of a crown, and others ornament\r\ntheir faces with dyes. The men go entirely naked, and use no other arms\r\nbut the bow and arrow. The women wear a girdle reaching nearly to the\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nAlthough they have fixed residences, and cultivate some vegetables,\r\nwith feijao, and three sorts of Indian corn, white, violet, and\r\nanother, which the Paulistas denominate _peruruca_, they wander\r\nabout a part of the year in pursuit of game and wild fruits.\r\n\r\nTheir houses are of considerable length, and are formed by two ranges\r\nof an equal number of poles, the flexibility of which admits of their\r\njunction at the centre, and being intertwined with twigs, constitute a\r\nsimple structure, which is finished by the _guaricanga_ (a species\r\nof palm tree) as its ultimate covering, with a narrow entrance at one\r\nextremity. Fires are made in file along the middle of the building, the\r\ninhabitants sleeping upon the ground with their feet extended towards\r\nthem, and many families constituting the inmates of one dwelling.\r\n\r\nTheir instruments of agriculture are rudely constructed of wood, with\r\ntools of stones; and they make certain vessels for the fermentation of\r\ninebriating beverages, which they frequently partake of to excess.\r\n\r\nThey domesticate some indigenous animals, such as the _quaty_ and\r\n_cotia_; and of European quadrupeds only the dog for hunting.\r\nThey prefer the flesh of the horse and mule to that of the ox. On all\r\noccasions where any friendly intercourse obtains between them and the\r\nPaulistas, they appear to regard iron alone as an article of any value.\r\nTheir natural ferocity has prevented the Portuguese from extending\r\nthemselves or cultivation to the westward.\r\n\r\nAmongst other numerous species of birds, remarkable for their size,\r\nplumage, and rarity, are the emu ostrich, _colhereira_, _caroe_,\r\n_tabuyaya_, _tayuyu_, _jacu_, _mutun_, macuco partridge, _tucano_,\r\nparrot, _araponga_, _guraputepoca_, the troquaze dove, _rola_, heron,\r\n_inhuma_, white _urubu_, _soco_, wild goose, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Paulistas (inhabitants of St. Paulo) are at present esteemed the\r\nbest people of the state, although various accounts would warrant the\r\nbelief of their being formerly of a very different character; but these\r\nrepresentations must be received with caution. It is evident that their\r\nvalour and enterprise have, on many occasions, been very conspicuous.\r\nVosgien, the most moderate of all the writers against them, says,\r\nthat the city of St. Paulo was a species of republic, independent of\r\nthe Portuguese, and formed of bands from different nations, the whole\r\nill regulated, and consisting of freebooters and thieves, who paid a\r\ntribute of gold to the King of Portugal, till they were subjugated by\r\nthat crown. This is in opposition to the Portuguese authorities, who\r\naffirm that they were always faithful subjects of Portugal, from the\r\nfoundation of the capitania.\r\n\r\nFrom the period of Philip II. becoming possessed of Portugal, and\r\nhaving, in consequence, some controul over its colonies, till the day\r\nof acclamation, which restored the crown to John IV. the Paulistas did\r\nnot deem themselves under the jurisdiction of the Castilian court,\r\nbut opposed the Spaniards who were in possession of the rich lands to\r\nthe south and west of the Paraguay; and had begun to approximate to\r\nthe centre of the continent with their establishments. This induced\r\nthe Paulistas to enter upon a secret expedition in 1631, in order to\r\ninterrupt their progress. Having traversed, with eight hundred men,\r\nthe certâms, or interior, the rivers Parannapanema and Tibagy, they\r\nfell upon Villa Rica, and Ciudad Real. The town of Xerez, situated near\r\nthe heads of the river Mondego, experienced the same misfortune; also\r\nthirty-two aldeias that constituted three small provinces.\r\n\r\nThe Paulistas, although they did not designate the domestic\r\nIndians by the appellation of captives, or slaves, but by that of\r\n_administrados_, disposed of them as such, giving them to their\r\ncreditors in payment of debts, and by way of dowry on occasions of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, who possessed or had the controul over a great number\r\nof Indians, and under whose power they received the denomination\r\nof _administrados_, without any consequences of slavery being\r\nattached to the term, declaimed against the abuses practised by the\r\nPaulistas, and demonstrated to them the impropriety of usurping a right\r\nto dispose of the liberty of the Indian.\r\n\r\nThe Paulistas, who were opulent, and owed all their wealth to the\r\narms of their numerous _administrados_, determined to expel the\r\nJesuits, in order that the truths which they promulgated should not\r\nmilitate against their interest.\r\n\r\nThe reciprocal opposition of two families, each wishing to have\r\nthe entire administration of the government, led them, with their\r\nrespective partizans, to open warfare, which would have conducted to\r\nthe most disastrous results, if the prudence of some ecclesiastics had\r\nnot disarmed them on the field of battle, by persuading the chiefs to a\r\ncompromise, by which an equal number of the contending families, from\r\nthence forward, were to enter upon the functions of the government.\r\n\r\nThis compact, accomplished in the year 1654, continued until the\r\nmiddle of the following century, when a cavalheiro, not related to\r\nthe privileged families, was elected for a judge, which appointment\r\nwas protested against by them, and finally settled in their favour at\r\nRio de Janeiro, about the time when this individual had completed the\r\nterm of his jurisdiction. The ability with which he had discharged\r\nthe duties of the office, convinced the Paulistas that personal merit\r\nought, in conducting the government, to be preferred to the old system.\r\n\r\nThe antipathy that existed for a long period between the Thaubatenos\r\nand Piratininganos, and produced so many duels and disasters; the fatal\r\ncampaign of 1631; the revolutions caused by the mutual enmity of the\r\ntwo families alluded to; the civil war between the said Paulistas and\r\nthe European Portuguese, at the commencement of the mining adventures\r\nin Minas Geraes; with other animosities, may be regarded as the\r\nfoundation of the exaggerated charges of want of loyalty, with which\r\nmany writers have charged this people.\r\n\r\nThey have a provincial trait which characterises them on their visits\r\nto other places. They always wear a sort of capote, or cloak, called\r\na _ponche_, with an aperture in the centre, through which they\r\nintroduce the head and neck.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Jaguary, on the Beira-Mar, or sea-coast, and the river\r\nTerere, from the serra above, divide this province into northern and\r\nsouthern, each constituting a comarca, or ouvidoria, designated by the\r\nhead town, which, till recently, were Paranagua in the south, and St.\r\nPaulo in the north.\r\n\r\nBy a law of February, 1812, the former was changed for the town of\r\nCurytiba, where the ouvidor has since resided; and it is the head of\r\nthis division, denominated the comarca of Paranagua and Curytiba. The\r\nother was divided into two comarcas, and the new one was denominated\r\nHitu.\r\n\r\nThe longest day of the year, which is in December, comprises nearly\r\nfourteen hours in the southern part of the province, at which period\r\nthe inhabitants of the margins of the river Grande, the northern\r\nboundary, have not thirteen hours and a half of day.\r\n\r\nThe comarca of Paranagua and Curytiba, comprises the following towns:--\r\n\r\n    Curytiba\r\n    Paranagua\r\n    Guaratuba\r\n    Antonia\r\n    Cannanea\r\n    Iguape\r\n    Castro\r\n    St. Joze\r\n    Lages\r\n    Villa do Principe.\r\n\r\nCurytiba, a considerable and famous town, now the head of the comarca,\r\nand ordinary residence of the ouvidor, (head magistrate,) is well\r\nsituated upon the left margin of a small river, which has a bridge for\r\nthe accommodation of its inhabitants. It has a magnificent church,\r\ncalled Our Lady da Luz, the hermitages of the Lady of Terco, Rosario,\r\nand St. Francisco de Paula, and a Terceira order of St. Francisco de\r\nAssis. All its structures are of stone or brick, and the streets are\r\npaved.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Jas. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  A PAULISTA AND A BRAZILIAN MENDICANT.]\r\n\r\nParanagua is a town of some note, built of stone, and previously to\r\nthe year 1812 was the head of the comarca. It has three hermitages,\r\nand a church of the Lady of Rosario. Its situation, unhealthy, and\r\npresenting nothing agreeable to the view, is ten miles distant from\r\nthe sea, upon the southern bank of the bay from which it borrows the\r\nname, and in front of the western point of the island of Cotinga. It\r\nhas a permutation or smelting house, a _Juiz de Fora_, and a\r\nprofessor of Latin. The Jesuits had a college here, which has, since\r\ntheir expulsion, been repaired at the cost of the treasury. Farinha,\r\nrice, coffee, and other articles, with wheat, which is brought from\r\nCurytiba, are its exports.\r\n\r\nGuaratuba, (the real name of which is Villa Nova de St. Luiz,) situated\r\nnear a morro, upon the right margin of the southern arm of the river\r\nGuaratuba, in front of the island of Guarazes, and seven miles from\r\nthe sea, is yet small, but stands advantageously for becoming more\r\nconsiderable. It exports various necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nAntonio enjoys an agreeable, and healthy situation, ten miles west of\r\nthe town of Paranagua, at the extremity of a bay, on a peninsula, and\r\nin front of the embouchures of the Cachoeira and Nhundiaquara. It was\r\ncreated a town in 1800. The mother church, deemed an embellishment, is\r\ndenominated Our Lady of Pilar. Its vicinity can boast of considerable\r\nplantations of mandioca, the farinha of which root is exported, as well\r\nas timber and cords of imbe. In its district is the aldeia of Morrete,\r\nnear a river, up which canoes advance to take in the productions\r\ncultivated within its boundaries, and those conveyed hither from\r\nCurytiba upon the backs of mules.\r\n\r\nCannanea, an inconsiderable town, and pleasantly situated upon a small\r\nisland, about ten miles within the bar of its name, and only separated\r\nfrom the continent by a narrow strait, has a church dedicated to St.\r\nJoao Baptista. Its inhabitants are agriculturists and fishermen; rice\r\nis the principal article exported. At the entrance of the bar of\r\nCannanea, on the side of the continent, there is a stone of European\r\nmarble, with the royal arms of Portugal; and, although much defaced, is\r\nascertained to have been erected there in the year 1503.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles south-west of Cannanea, is the aldeia of Ararapira, in\r\nformer times a villota of Christianized Indians, with its church\r\ndedicated to St. Joze da Marinha, situated upon an arm of the lake or\r\nbay of Cannanea, which prolongs itself between the General Cordillera\r\nand another contiguous to the ocean.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight miles (or forty, following the winding of the lake) to\r\nthe north-east of the town of Cannanea, is the considerable town\r\nof Iguape, situated pleasantly at the extremity of the lake, and a\r\nlittle removed from the right margin of the river Assunguy, which is\r\ngenerally designated by the name of the town. It formerly had a house\r\nof permutation, and has a celebrated church dedicated to the Lady of\r\nNeves. The exportation of rice from hence is considerable.\r\n\r\nCastro, with a church dedicated to St. Amaro, is yet a small town,\r\nbut well situated at the point where the river Hyapo (of which it\r\noriginally took the name) traverses the royal road. In its vicinity are\r\nfound the most precious stones. After the subjugation of the savages of\r\nGuarapuava, great expectations are entertained of its increase, as well\r\nas of the cultivation of its extensive contours.\r\n\r\nSt. Joze, ten miles to the south-east of Curytiba, is agreeably\r\nelevated above the surrounding campinha, and is one mile from the left\r\nmargin of the small river of its name, which, after a course of seven\r\nmiles further, incorporates itself with the Curytiba.\r\n\r\nForty miles to the west of the two last-named towns, there is a\r\nregister upon the margin of the Curytiba, where, in some years, thirty\r\nthousand mules pass to Sorocaba.\r\n\r\nLages, otherwise Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres, is the most southern\r\ntown of the province, and was never considerable, in consequence\r\nof its proximity to the savages, but is at present much reduced by\r\ntheir invasions. It is situated upon what is denominated the royal\r\nroad, two miles north of the river Caveiras, and about one from the\r\nsmall Caraha, which takes the name of a species of cane or bamboo\r\nthat grows in abundance upon its margins, and are the best of the\r\nprovince; some have so peculiar a varnish upon them, that they appear\r\nlike the work of an able hand. There are excellent _amolar_, or\r\ngrindstones, in the same stream. The country surrounding this town is\r\nof great fertility, is irrigated by many rivers, and has a temperate\r\nand salubrious climate. Legumes, wheat, Indian corn, &c. with cattle,\r\nare raised, and almost every species of fruit tree prospers; but the\r\npeople, besides diminishing in number, are poor for want of an outlet\r\nfor their productions. The opening of a good road, by which the farmers\r\nmight with facility transmit their surplus produce to the port of St.\r\nCatharina; or perhaps better through the medium of the town of Laguna,\r\n(the road terminating in that case at the port of Guarda, from whence\r\nthe Tuburao affords navigation to the said town,) would induce numerous\r\ncolonies to establish themselves in this fertile territory, rendered\r\nmore desirable by the fine temperature of the climate, when the\r\naborigines would be either compelled to retire, or to submit to some\r\nmode of subjection. The many aldeias, which would necessarily be spread\r\nover this fine district, affording plains for the extensive breeding\r\nof cattle, could not fail to produce a rapid increase of the town of\r\nLages. In such a state of things it would become the head of a populous\r\nand rich comarca.\r\n\r\nVilla do Principe, originally St. Antonio da Lapa, is ten miles\r\nsouthward from the before-mentioned register of Curytiba, near the\r\nroyal road. Its people are breeders of cattle, and cultivate wheat,\r\nrye, Indian corn, and divers fruits.\r\n\r\nFive miles north of the same register, and also upon the border of the\r\nroad, near a small river which contributes its water to the Iguassu, is\r\nthe arraial of Thauha, possessing a hermitage of the Lady of Conceiçao.\r\n\r\nCurytiba, the name by which this district has been recently designated,\r\nin the Brazilian language signifies _curu_, “pine,” and _tiba_,\r\n“many.” It comprises almost all the comarca, or southern part of the\r\nprovince, from the General Serra to the westward. The winter commences\r\nin this part about May, and lasts till September, with a south, and\r\noccasionally a south-west wind, which is colder than the first. The\r\nmost common trees are the Brazilian pine. These majestic trees form\r\nextensive woods, abounding with the mountain hog, which go in herds, at\r\ntimes, of one hundred and more.\r\n\r\nThe fruit trees of Europe prosper here better than the indigenous ones\r\nof this continent, and amongst the former may be enumerated the fig,\r\npear, apple, plum, peach, quince, cherry, walnut, and chestnut. The\r\nolive-trees are laden with flowers, but rarely fructify. Mandioca,\r\nthe banana, coffee, and cotton trees, as well as the sugar cane, only\r\nprosper in some situations. The _matte_ grows spontaneously, and\r\nis very common. The great consumption of a beverage made from this\r\ntree in the province, and in those of St. Catharina and Rio Grande do\r\nSul, and also by many people in the metropolis, augurs favourably for\r\nthe addition of another branch of commerce to this comarca. Bunches of\r\ngrapes are frequently met with of upwards of five pounds weight; but\r\nhitherto no good wine has been manufactured.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1812 a large quantity of divers plants of the vine were\r\nsent here from Europe; and it is confidently expected that many will\r\nsucceed as well if not better than in their native soil; so that with\r\nproper attention good wine may in time be produced.\r\n\r\nThe Curytibanos pass for the most powerful and robust people amongst\r\nthe Paulistas. They cultivate abundance of wheat and Indian corn, with\r\nsome rice; they breed cattle, horses, and mules, possess a great number\r\nof cows, and make some butter and cheese. The cows are of a large size,\r\nand afford the greatest quantity of milk in summer; that, however,\r\nwhich they supply in the winter is the best; the portion which in the\r\nfirst season yields four cheeses, in the winter produces eight. The\r\nmajor part of the breeders of cattle give them salt; an animal which\r\nis lean receives a greater ration, in order that it may fatten more\r\nexpeditiously. It is observed, that sheep begin to die after they have\r\npastured ten years, in whatever situation they may be. Immediately on\r\nthe first symptom of the disease, which is known by the retiring of the\r\nanimals towards the door of their dono, as if praying for a remedy, it\r\nis requisite to remove them to another part, and when not more than a\r\nleague distant from their former pasture, the contagion will cease.\r\n\r\nThe northern division of this province comprehends the following towns,\r\nviz.:-- In the comarca of St. Paulo:\r\n\r\n    St. Paulo\r\n    Santos\r\n    St. Vincente\r\n    Itanhaen\r\n    St. Sebastian\r\n    Villa da Princessa\r\n    Ubatuba\r\n    Parnahiba\r\n    Mugi das Cruzes\r\n    Jacarehi\r\n    St. Joze\r\n    Thaubate\r\n    Pindamonhangaba\r\n    Guaratingueta\r\n    Lorena\r\n    Cunha\r\n    Parahitinga\r\n    Jundiahy\r\n    Tibaya\r\n    Braganca\r\n    Mugi-Mirim\r\n\r\nIn the comarca of Hitu:\r\n\r\n    Sorocaba\r\n    Itapitininga\r\n    Itapeva\r\n    Appiahy\r\n    Hitu\r\n    Porto Feliz\r\n    St. Carlos\r\n\r\nSt. Paulo is a city in a state of mediocrity, but agreeably seated\r\nupon land somewhat elevated at the angle of the confluence of the\r\nTamandatahi, with the Hynhangabahu, which washes it on the western\r\nside, and the former on the eastern. It is nearly two miles from\r\nthe Tiete, which passes to the north, forty miles north-west from\r\nSantos, which is its port; seven miles to the south of the Tropic;\r\nand three hundred and fifty fathoms above the level of the ocean. It\r\nis ornamented with a house of Misericordia, various hermitages, and\r\nthree hospitals; a convent of Benedictines, another of Franciscans, a\r\nthird of slippered Carmelites, two recolhimentos for women, a house\r\nof permutation, various open spaces or squares, three good bridges of\r\nstone, with others of wood, and divers fountains; however, the best\r\nwater is afforded by the rivers. Some streets are well paved. The\r\nedifices are generally formed of what is termed _taipa_, which\r\nconsists of twofold wooden planks, constituting the frame, filled\r\nin with earth, and white-washed. This city is the residence of the\r\ngovernor of the province, and the ouvidor of the comarca, or district,\r\nwho fulfils also the duties of crown judge, &c. There is a Juiz de\r\nFora, who also executes the functions of an Attorney General, auditor\r\nof the military, and deputy to the junta of the treasury. It has some\r\nmasters, who have the high-sounding denomination of royal professors\r\nof the primitive letters, Latin, rhetoric, philosophy, dogmatical\r\ntheology, and morality. The inhabitants, in number from thirty-five\r\nto forty thousand, are divided between two parishes, one being of the\r\ncathedral, the chapter of which consists of fourteen canons, including\r\nfour dignitaries of archdeacon, archpriest, chanter, and treasurer-mor.\r\nThe other has a church called Santa Efigenia. The Jesuits commenced\r\nthis city, in the year 1552, with the foundation of a college, in\r\nwhich they celebrated the first mass on the day of the conversion of\r\nthe apostle with whose name it was consecrated in 1554, and which\r\nafforded the subsequent name of St. Paulo to the town and province.\r\nThis structure now constitutes the palace of the governor. Senhor Joao\r\nCarlos de Oainansen at present fills that situation. Six years after\r\nthe first establishment of the Jesuits here, St. Paulo acquired the\r\ndenomination of a town. Its first inhabitants were a horde of Guayana\r\nIndians, with their cacique or chief called Tebireca, who lived in the\r\naldeia of Piratinin, near the small river of the same name, not far\r\nfrom the new colony, which, in consequence, took the appellation of\r\nSt. Paulo de Piratininga, and retained it till the year 1712, when it\r\nwas dignified with the title of city, and in 1746 was further honoured\r\nby being made the seat of a bishopric. The Indians were soon augmented\r\nby a great number of Europeans, whom they called _Emboabas_, in\r\nconsequence of their legs being covered, and which conveyed to the\r\nminds of the Indians a resemblance of certain birds with feathered legs\r\nso called by them. The alliances of the new settlers, with the Indians,\r\nsoon produced a third class of people, to whom they gave the name of\r\n_Mamelucos_, with which the establishment received a considerable\r\nincrease; and the city at this day comprises upwards of four thousand\r\nhouses, with the number of inhabitants previously mentioned, one half\r\nof which are computed to be whites. The salubrity of the climate, and\r\nthe abundance and moderate value of all the necessaries of life, give\r\nit the decided preference for the foundation of an university, if the\r\nviews of the government become enlightened enough to promote such an\r\nestablishment in the Brazil. The body, and consequently the mind, of\r\nthe student would here have more vigour for literary application, than\r\nin the warmer or more northern climates of this region, and books or\r\nlibraries would receive less damage from the destructive prey of\r\ninsects. St. Paulo is considered a most healthy situation; and I have\r\nknown the valetudinarian of Rio de Janeiro, contemplate a change to\r\nits moderate and invigorating climate, as exceedingly desirable. There\r\nare a great number of quintas or shacaras in its suburbs. Among the\r\nfruit trees which embellish them, the _jabuticaba_ is not rare,\r\naffording a fine and excellent fruit. The oranges are not of good\r\nquality, and the tree sustains considerable injury in years of much\r\nfrost. The same may be said of the coffee and banana trees, as well as\r\nof mandioca and the sugar cane.\r\n\r\nSantos, considerable, populous, commercial, and advantageously situated\r\nupon the northern side of the island of St. Vincente, was erected\r\ninto a town in 1545, and possesses a house of Misericordia, which is\r\nthe most ancient of the Brazil, a Franciscan convent, an hospicio (or\r\nentertaining house) of Bentos, another of slippered Carmelites, and\r\nvarious chapels; the ex-Jesuitical college of St. Miguel, after being\r\nmuch dilapidated, was renovated for the military hospital. A Juiz de\r\nFora presides over the senate. The houses are solid and of stone; and\r\nthe female part of their inmates are celebrated for making excellent\r\nlace. This town was sacked by the Dutch, and upon another occasion by\r\nthe English. Its port, the entrance to which is defended by various\r\nforts, is capable of receiving large ships, and it is the depositary\r\nof much sugar, rum, coarse cottons, coffee, hides, and bacon, which\r\narticles constitute its exports. The produce of rice and coffee are\r\nalone abundant. The winter is always a very rainy season.\r\n\r\nSeven miles to the south-west, on the southern coast of the same\r\nisland, upon the entrance of the bar of its name, is situated St.\r\nVincente, the most ancient town of the province, in former times\r\nflourishing and famous, but now sunk into insignificance, in\r\nconsequence of Santos being better adapted for commerce, to which it\r\nhas removed from this town. Its inhabitants are mostly fishermen.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles to the west of Santos is the small arraial of Cubatam,\r\nupon the northern margin of the river which affords its name, and from\r\nwhich it sustains great damage at the period of the greatest floods.\r\nEvery thing that descends from the serra above, and destined for the\r\ntown, is here embarked. A project of uniting this island with the\r\nterra-firma has been proposed by means of a calcada, or paved way,\r\nacross the channel of St. Vincente, which, if carried into effect, will\r\nprevent many shipwrecks. At the bar of Bertioga there is an armaçao, or\r\nestablishment for whale fishing.\r\n\r\nItanhaen, a small place, erected into a town in 1561, possesses a\r\nFranciscan convent, and is situated near a mount, upon the northern\r\nmargin of the bay from which it borrows its name, and which it\r\nfrequently exchanges for that of the Lady of Conceiçao, the patroness\r\nof its church. Farinha, rice, and timber are exported from hence.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Sebastian, so called from the patron of its church, is\r\nyet inconsiderable, with indifferent houses, and streets of sand. It\r\nis seated upon the straight of Toque-Toque, in front of the island of\r\nits name, near the embouchure of a small river, and at the commencement\r\nof a fertile plain, where agriculture might be rendered flourishing\r\nin all its branches, and which was for many years almost abandoned,\r\nin consequence of the farmers being prohibited from exporting their\r\nproductions to those places where they would have derived the greatest\r\nadvantage from them. About three miles to the east, in an agreeable\r\nsituation, there is a Franciscan convent, and near to it an arraial,\r\ndenominated Bairro. The women are occupied in potteries, the men in\r\nfishing, and in the culture of various necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nVilla da Princeza, so created in 1809, is situated upon the northern\r\ncoast of the island of St. Sebastian, near the chapel of Nossa Senhora\r\nof Luz, which for the present serves as its mother church, as well as\r\nfor all the inhabitants of the island. This island is appropriated to\r\nthe culture of the sugar-cane and tobacco, which are esteemed the best\r\nof the province, and their exportation is considerable. On the eastern\r\npart of the island there is an armaçao for whale fishing.\r\n\r\nUbatuba, a small town, with a church, and a chapel of the Lady of\r\nConceiçao, is situated near the mouth of an inconsiderable stream,\r\non the verge of a fertile plain, irrigated by various torrents. Its\r\ninhabitants are fishermen, and cultivators of mandioca, rice, and\r\ncoffee. It is nearly thirty miles to the north-east of the town of St.\r\nSebastian, and near the boundary of the province. Between this town\r\nand the afore-mentioned arraial of Bairro, is the bay of Flamengos,\r\nalso that of Inquiriquere, both of which are capable of receiving many\r\nships. Into the latter, which is the most westerly, the river of the\r\nsame name discharges itself, and affords a disembarrassed navigation\r\nfor only three miles.\r\n\r\nParanahiba, an inconsiderable town, is situated upon the left margin\r\nof the river Tiete, about twenty miles distant in a westerly direction\r\nfrom St. Paulo. It has a church, and an hospicio of Bento Friars; and\r\nits inhabitants, with those of the adjacent districts, breed large\r\ncattle, and raise a diversity of the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nMugi das Cruzes is a considerable town, abundantly supplied with the\r\nnecessaries of life, and enjoys a good situation, about two miles\r\nfrom the Tiete, thirty-five east-north-east of St. Paulo, and forty\r\nnorth of Santos. It has a church, dedicated to St. Anna, a convent of\r\nshod Carmelites, a hermitage of Bom Jesus, and a Terceira order of\r\nCarmo. The houses are of taipa. The inhabitants breed cattle, and form\r\nextensive plantations of the coffee tree, the produce of which, with\r\nsome rum, constitutes their wealth.\r\n\r\nNear thirty miles to the north-east of Mugi das Cruzes, the small town\r\nof Jacarehi is situated, upon the right margin of the river Parahiba,\r\nwith a church. The passage across the river here is much frequented.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Joze is ten miles to the north of Jacarehi, takes the\r\nname of the patron of its church, and is situated near the Parahiba,\r\nupon land which constituted part of a fazenda of the Jesuits, its\r\nfounders.\r\n\r\nThaubate is one of the most considerable and best situated towns of the\r\nprovince. It is upwards of one hundred miles to the north-east of St.\r\nPaulo, seventy from Mugi das Cruzes, forty from Jacarehi, and three\r\nfrom the Parahiba, near a small stream. Besides the church dedicated to\r\nSt. Francisco, it has a convent of the same saint, a Terceira order,\r\nand the chapels of the Lady of Pilar and Rosario. Almost all the houses\r\nare of taipa, and few with one story. Its inhabitants, whose ancestors\r\nwere antagonists of the Piratiningans of St. Paulo, cultivate the\r\nnecessaries of life and tobacco, raise pigs and poultry in considerable\r\nquantities, and sugar cane in small plantations. They manufacture\r\nhandsome mats and hand-baskets, which are sent to different parts.\r\nNear the embouchure of a small river, and close upon the margin of the\r\nParahiba, is the inconsiderable arraial of Tremembe, with a chapel of\r\nBom Jesus. At the distance of from ten to fourteen miles is the parish\r\nof Cassapaba, a new dismemberment of the preceding town.\r\n\r\nPindamonhangaba, a town in a state of mediocrity, is well supplied,\r\nparticularly with fish, and advantageously situated in a plain, on the\r\nright margin of the Parahiba. It possesses a church of the Lady of Bom\r\nSuccesso, and a hermitage of St. Joze. It is more than ten miles to the\r\nnorth-north-east of Thaubate; and its inhabitants, who are considered\r\nprudent and industrious, cultivate every article of subsistence\r\npeculiar to the country, and breed large cattle.\r\n\r\nGuaratingueta, situated upon the right bank of the Parahiba, which\r\naffords it an ample supply of fish, is a considerable town, about\r\ntwenty-five miles to the east of Pindamonhangaba, embellished with\r\na large church, dedicated to St. Antonio, a chapel of the Lady of\r\nRosario, and another of St. Gonçalo. The houses, similar to those of\r\nSt. Paulo and other places, are constructed of _taipa_. Its\r\ninhabitants cultivate much tobacco, and breed hogs and large cattle.\r\nCotton cloths and sugar are the principal branches of commerce. About\r\ntwo miles distant from it is the famous and much visited chapel of the\r\nLady of Apparecida.\r\n\r\nLorena, a middling town, upon the right margin of the Parahiba, ten\r\nmiles east of Guaratingueta and seven above the mouths of the Imbauhi,\r\nwhich flows from the Mantiqueira mountains, and of the Bocaina, which\r\ncomes from the south, is situated at the passage to Minas Geraes\r\ndenominated Porto do Meyra, and has a church called Piedade: Guaipicure\r\nwas its primitive name.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Lorena, where legumes and rice grow abundantly, and\r\nlarge quantities of hogs and poultry are bred, the parish of St. Anna\r\ndas Areas is situated. It has been recently dismembered of that portion\r\nof territory now constituting the parish of Bannanal.\r\n\r\nA league below Lorena there is another passage to the province of Minas\r\nGeraes, called Porto da Cachoeira.\r\n\r\nCunha, formerly Facao, is yet an inconsiderable town; but, from its\r\nadvantageous situation upon a serra in the vicinity of the Jacuhy,\r\nand about twenty-five miles north of Parati, is susceptible of much\r\nimprovement. It has a church, of which the Lady of Conceiçao is the\r\npatroness. The climate is salubrious, and the nights of June and\r\nJuly are fresh, and even the natives feel them cold. Hitherto the\r\nflowers and fruit trees of Europe have prospered better here than in\r\nany other situation of the torrid zone. In its environs there are\r\nextensive groves of majestic pines, and the inhabitants raise the\r\ncommon productions of the country, abundance of Indian corn, and large\r\nquantities of poultry and pigs. An indifferent road or track connects\r\nthis town with Parati, and would, if made equally easy and secure with\r\nthose of the arraial of Cubatao, for the transport of its productions\r\nto St. Paulo and Santos, become a flourishing district.\r\n\r\nParahitinga, a medium town, and well situated upon the left bank of the\r\nriver which affords it the name, is seven miles above the embouchure\r\nof the Parahibuna and forty north of the town of Ubatuba. St. Luiz is\r\nthe patron of its church, which, with an extensive bridge over the\r\nriver that bathes it, are the only objects worthy the observation of\r\nthe traveller. The inhabitants breed a great number of hogs, which\r\nconstitute the principal branch of their commerce.\r\n\r\nJundiahi is a middling and flourishing town, one mile distant from the\r\nleft bank of the river from which its name is borrowed, thirty-five\r\nmiles to the northnorth-west of St. Paulo, and the same distance\r\nto the east-north-east of Hitu. It has a good church of Our Lady\r\nof Desterro, an _hospicio_ of Benedictines, and a bridge over\r\nthe river, which is stocked, amongst other fish, with those called\r\n_jundias_, from which it derived the name. Its inhabitants raise\r\ncattle, mules, horses, and large quantities of the sugar cane, and have\r\nfor the extraction of its juice various _engenhos_, or works;\r\nalso abundance of legumes and Indian corn, with which they furnish the\r\ncaravans passing from Goyaz.\r\n\r\nTibaya, or Atibaya, situated near the river of the same name, has\r\na church called St. Joam, is yet small, and is thirty-five miles\r\nnorth-north-east of St. Paulo, an equal distance east of Jundiahi, and\r\nas far west of St. Joze. The inhabitants raise feijao, Indian corn,\r\nwheat, and hogs.\r\n\r\nBragança, which is ten miles to the north-east of Tibaya, is yet\r\ninconsiderable, but the inhabitants are said to live in abundance,\r\nraise pigs in large quantities, wheat, Indian corn, and legumes.\r\n\r\nMugi-Mirim, situated on the road of Goyaz, upon the river of the same\r\nname, which a little below unites itself with the Mugi-Guassu, is\r\nin a state of mediocrity, and well supplied with the necessaries of\r\nlife, particularly fish and meat. It has engenhos of sugar, farms of\r\ncattle, and only one church, dedicated to St. Joze. Upon the northern\r\nbank of the Mugi-Guassu, where this river traverses the road to the\r\ntown of Mugi-Mirim, is the arraial and parish which takes its name,\r\nwith a church of the Lady of Conceiçao. Its inhabitants are farmers of\r\nmandioca, feijao, and Indian corn, and breeders of cattle and hogs. The\r\nparish of Franca is the most northern of the province; the inhabitants\r\nextend themselves to the margin of the Grande, breed cattle, and\r\ncultivate those necessaries which the territory best affords. The\r\nchurch is dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Conceiçao.\r\n\r\nSorocaba is situated where the river of its name traverses the royal\r\nroad of Curytiba to the capital, from which it is distant sixty miles\r\nto the west. It is a flourishing and considerable town, ornamented with\r\na church of the Lady of Ponte, a recolhimento of women, an hospicio\r\nof Bentos, and a hermitage of St. Antonio. Its actual population is\r\ncomposed of seventeen hundred and seventy-seven families, of which\r\ntwo-thirds are whites; they breed cattle and horses, and cultivate\r\ncotton, sugar, and Indian corn, with the most common necessaries of the\r\ncountry, but their principal profits arise from trafficking in cattle,\r\nwhich come from the southern districts. In its environs there are\r\ncalcareous stone and good flint stone. The royal fabric of Hipannema,\r\ndistant about seven miles, and established near a small stream of the\r\nsame name, for the reception of the produce of rich mines of iron\r\nin the serra Guarassoiava, will tend to render this town still more\r\nconsiderable. Many years ago a mine of silver was discovered in the\r\ndistrict of Guarassoiava, which was abandoned, in consequence of its\r\npoverty and difficult extraction.\r\n\r\nItapitininga, yet an inconsiderable town, and well situated in a vast\r\nand delightful plain near the royal road, is two miles from the right\r\nbank of the river from which it has the name. It is embellished with\r\na church of the Lady of Merces, is well provided with water, and is\r\nabout forty miles to the south of Sorocaba. The people who inhabit\r\nit cultivate wheat, legumes, and abundance of Indian corn. The peach\r\nand grape are plentiful and of good flavour, and, as in most other\r\ncultivated districts of this province, the breed of cattle is numerous.\r\n\r\nItapeva, situated near the royal road, or _estrada real_, as\r\nit is denominated, in the vicinity of the Verde, is at present\r\ninconsiderable; it has a church, dedicated to St. Anna.\r\n\r\nAppiahi, a town of the same class as the preceding, is at a great\r\ndistance from the road, near the source of the river from which it\r\nderives its name, and in the vicinity of a morro, from whence, at its\r\norigin, much gold was extracted. It has one church.\r\n\r\nHitu, a large and flourishing town, is the head of the comarca of its\r\nname, having a church of the Lady of Candellaria, a Franciscan convent,\r\nan hospicio of slippered Carmelites, an hospital of Lazars, with its\r\nhermitage, others of Bom Jezus, the Lady of Patrocinio, and Santa Rita.\r\nAll its buildings are of _taipa_, and some streets are paved. It\r\nhas the usual royal professors, and is situated twenty-five miles to\r\nthe north-north-east of Sorocaba, sixty to the west-north-west of St.\r\nPaulo, and two from the left margin of the Tiete, which forms at this\r\nsituation a large and interesting fall, by the name of which this town\r\nis designated. Excessive heat is experienced here in the summer months.\r\nThe soil in the environs is peculiarly adapted to the culture of the\r\nsugar cane, of which there are extensive plantations, constituting the\r\nriches of its inhabitants, who also raise cattle and divers necessaries\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nPorto Feliz, formerly called Araritaguaba, is a moderate town, with\r\nhouses of wood, seated upon the left margin of the Tiete. It has a\r\nchurch of the Lady May dos Homens, (Mother of Men,) is nearly eighteen\r\nmiles to the west of Hitu, and twenty-five to the north-north-west of\r\nSorocaba, and is the port of the navigators to Cuiaba. The inhabitants\r\nare cattle-breeders, and cultivate the cane, feijao, and Indian corn.\r\n\r\nSt. Carlos, now so named from its church, but originally called\r\nCampinas, is situated near a small stream, something more than a league\r\nfrom the Tibaia, and six to the north of Hitu, and does not at present\r\nsurpass mediocrity, but is well supplied and enjoys facilities for\r\nbecoming more considerable. It is a land abounding with waters and\r\nwood, consequently well adapted for the culture of the cane, of which\r\nthere are at present some rich plantations, also of wheat, feijao, and\r\nIndian corn. It is upon the road from Jundiahi to Mugi-Mirim; from the\r\nlatter it is eight leagues distant in a direct line. Its district is\r\nbounded on the west by the new parish of Percicaba, whose church is\r\nsituated in a delightful plain that terminates in a small hill upon\r\nthe southern margin of the river that affords it the name, and near a\r\nbeautiful cascade of great height, which presents a barrier to further\r\nnavigation. Rich in majestic woods, and of great fertility, it is\r\nfavourable to various branches of agriculture, particularly the cane,\r\nof which there are plantations and engenhos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP.

Aleixo Garcia and his\r\nbrother or son, accompanied by a numerous band of domestic Indians,\r\nhaving passed the Paraguay, and penetrated to the proximity of the\r\nAndes in the middle of the sixteenth century, were the first known\r\ndiscoverers of the southern part of this vast province; and Manuel\r\nCorrea, a Paulista (as well as the others) having passed the Araguaya,\r\na considerable time afterwards, penetrated to its northern part.\r\n\r\nIt will be difficult perhaps, to ascertain the names of the other\r\ncertanistas, or commandants of bandeiras,[20] who visited this\r\nterritory in quest of Indians, during the interval from its discovery\r\nto the year 1718, when Antonio Pires de Campos, also a Paulista,\r\nproceeded up the river Cuiaba in search of the Cuchipo Indians, who\r\nhad an aldeia, where at this day is situated the hermitage of St.\r\nGonçalo. In the following year Pascoal Moreira Cabral advanced up the\r\nriver Cuchipo Mirim, and very soon discovered granites of gold. He\r\nleft here a portion of his company to accumulate as much as possible\r\nof it, and proceeded higher up the river, with the greater part of the\r\nbandeirantes, as far as the situation at present called Forquilha,\r\nwhere they caught some young Indians ornamented with pieces of gold,\r\nwhich proved that the country abounded with that metal; they were most\r\ndiligent in their searches after it, and collected a considerable\r\nportion. Returning to the party left behind, they descended with them\r\nthe river below, to the aldeia which Antonio Pires had visited the\r\npreceding year, where each one exhibited the quantity of gold he had\r\ncollected. Some found themselves possessed of one hundred oitavas,\r\n(2dwt. 7⅜gr. each,) others of half a pound weight, and many more of\r\nsmaller portions, but they were generally well satisfied; those who\r\naccompanied Captain Moreira Cabral had exceeded the rest in good\r\nfortune. He had for his own share one pound and a half of gold. The\r\nwhole party greatly lamented the want of mining instruments, as they\r\nwere compelled to use their hands in removing the earth or sand. They\r\nsoon began to construct cabanas, or dwelling places upon the margins of\r\nthe rivers, determined to persist as long as the precious ore lasted.\r\nA few weeks had only elapsed, when another bandeira arrived at the new\r\nestablishment, having been upon the margins of the river St. Lourenço,\r\nwhere they received intelligence of this discovery, and determined to\r\naugment the party.\r\n\r\nThe whole now consulted upon the circumstances attending their\r\nsituation, and resolved to despatch Joze Gabriel Antunes to the city\r\nof St. Paulo, with samples of gold, and tidings of their success; also\r\nto announce to the governor their solicitude to receive the necessary\r\ninstructions for the common weal and service of his Majesty. On the\r\nsame day, the 8th of April, 1719, on which this resolution was formed,\r\nthe party unanimously elected Captain Pascoal Moreira Cabral for\r\ntheir _guarda mor regente_ until the arrival of orders from the\r\ngovernor of St. Paulo, investing him with much authority, and promising\r\nhim implicit obedience. Antunes consumed many months, from the various\r\ndifficulties which beset his way, before he reached St. Paulo, where\r\nthe new discovery of the mines being divulged, numerous persons took\r\ntheir departure for them the following year, in various caravans, none\r\nof which arrived at Cuiaba without loss; many died on the way of fevers\r\nand different disasters. The misfortunes and losses which the numerous\r\nbandeiras, that continued to bend their course towards this province,\r\nannually sustained, were the result of ill-regulated measures, and the\r\nabsence of judicious combinations for preventing disorder upon the\r\nmarch, and obviating the palpable neglect of proceeding without fishing\r\ninstruments, which would have preserved many from famishing, and\r\nwithout fire arms for shooting game, or defence against wild animals\r\nand the natives.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the arraial or establishment was removed to the\r\nsituation of Forquilha, where Cabral had found a better vein of gold;\r\nand in the following, one Miguel Sutil, from Sorocaba, having taken up\r\na station with his party upon the margin of the Cuiaba, two Carijos,\r\nor domestic Indians, sent into the woods in search of honey, brought\r\nhim at night twenty-three pieces, _folhetas_, or lamina, of gold,\r\nwhich weighed one hundred and twenty oitavas, stating that there was\r\nmore in the wood where they had found it. Sutil, highly delighted, next\r\nmorning went with his European comrade, Joam Francisco, called by way\r\nof nickname Barbado, and all his domestic establishment, conducted by\r\nthe two Carijos to the place where they had found the precious metal,\r\nand which is the present site of the town of Cuiaba. Here they spent\r\nthe day, gathering with their hands all the gold upon the surface of\r\nthe ground, or thinly covered, and desisting only with the termination\r\nof daylight; they assembled late at their bivouacs, when Sutil found\r\nthat he had accumulated half an arroba, or sixteen pounds weight, of\r\ngold, and Barbado upwards of four hundred oitavas. This adventure\r\nbecoming known at the arraial of Forquilha, caused its removal to the\r\nsituation where Sutil and Barbado had been so successful, and where it\r\nwas calculated that four hundred arrobas of gold were collected in one\r\nmonth, without the excavations exceeding four fathoms in depth.\r\n\r\nIn this same year the governor Rodrigo Cezar de Menezes arrived at\r\nSt. Paulo, whose first concern was to exact the payment of the royal\r\nfifths upon this metal. With this intention he nominated two brothers,\r\nresident at St. Paulo, of distinguished birth and fortune, Lourenço\r\nLeme to the situation of Procurador of the Fifths, and John Leme to the\r\npost of Master de Campo of the same mines. Those two individuals, in\r\nconsequence of the liberty with which they had always triumphed over\r\nthe laws, were imprudently selected; and now considered themselves\r\nmore than ever authorised to consult with impunity their own caprices.\r\nOn arriving at the arraial, they adopted the most violent and absurd\r\nmeasures, and wished to expel from the mines all those who were not\r\nPaulistas. The chaplain remonstrating against this injustice, they\r\nordered a shot to be fired at him, which, erring in its object,\r\nkilled one of his friends. Actuated by the same lawless spirit, they\r\nordered one Pedro Leite to be inhumanly insulted at the time he was\r\nhearing mass, merely from some feeling of jealousy entertained against\r\nhim. These and other atrocities, which they committed, induced the\r\ngovernor-general to transmit orders for their being arrested and sent\r\nprisoners to St. Paulo. They received intimation of this circumstance\r\nfrom one of their relatives, and on the arrival of the Master de Campo,\r\nBalthazar Ribeiro, to execute the commands of the governor, they had\r\nalready fortified themselves in a remote place, accompanied by their\r\npartizans, where an attack was ineffectually made upon them. In a\r\nshort time, however, after the loss of some lives on both sides, they\r\nfled to the interior with a great number of their followers, but were\r\npursued until Lourenço Leme was killed by a shot, and his brother taken\r\nprisoner, and subsequently sent, with a summary of his crimes, to the\r\ncity of Bahia, the relaçam of which city ordered him to be executed in\r\n1724.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious amount of quintos, or fifths, which were received at St.\r\nPaulo in the year 1723, and the termination of the jurisdiction of the\r\nrapacious Lemes, excited an universal spirit in that city for mining.\r\nEvery one was desirous of becoming a miner of Cuiaba, notwithstanding\r\nthe calamities attached to so laborious and prolonged a voyage. Of more\r\nthan three hundred persons, who in the year 1725 departed from St.\r\nPaulo, with upwards of twenty canoes, only two white men, and three\r\nnegroes escaped. All the rest were killed or made prisoners in an\r\nencounter which they had with an Indian armada (the Payagoas) in the\r\nriver Paraguay, in front of the embouchure of the Harez. Although the\r\nPaulistas knew that the Payagoas were celebrated mariners, they were\r\ntotally ignorant of this nation possessing so numerous a fleet.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to remark here, that the first Paulistas who entered\r\nthe river Paraguay met with two nations, denominated _Payagoas_,\r\nand _Guaycurus_; both numerous and formidable; the first from its\r\nlarge armadas, and the second from the dexterity of the natives on\r\nhorseback, from which they acquired the denomination of Cavalleiros.\r\nThe Payagoas, from time immemorial, were always masters of the\r\nnavigation of the Paraguay and its confluents, as far as nature offered\r\nno impediments. The Guaycurus had also always possessed the adjacencies\r\nof the same river, for the space of three hundred and fifty miles at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nAs it is an indubitable fact, that there were no horses in South\r\nAmerica previous to its discovery by Pinson, in 1500, and that they\r\nwere first introduced into this country by its two conquering nations,\r\nSpain and Portugal, it cannot be difficult to define, with tolerable\r\ncertainty, the epoch when the Guaycurus first obtained these animals,\r\nwhich they used at all times, even in their shortest excursions,\r\nand with which they rendered themselves so formidable to all the\r\ncircumjacent nations, not excepting the conquerors of the country.\r\nIt would appear probable that they first derived the horse from the\r\ncolonists of Assumption, rather than from those of Peru. If they\r\nwere in former times powerful in war canoes, they only retained a\r\nsufficient number for passing from one to the other side of rivers, on\r\ndiscovering that the horse was more useful and advantageous for war, or\r\nfor depredations upon the distant tribes. Such was the state of those\r\ntwo nations about the year 1720, when their reciprocal aversion was\r\nconverted into a firm alliance, the Guaycurus soon becoming equally\r\nformidable upon both elements, with an establishment of war canoes\r\nlittle inferior to that of the Payagoas.\r\n\r\nThey continued to annoy the rising province from the year 1725 to\r\nthe year 1768, at which period a disunion occurred, and the Payagoas\r\ndescended to the low Paraguay, formed an alliance, or, more properly\r\nspeaking, subjected themselves to the Spaniards of the province of\r\nParanna, where they fixed their habitations, and have lived since 1774,\r\na little below Assumption. Two causes are said to have influenced the\r\nPayagoas in this separation; the great diminution of numbers which they\r\nhad sustained in repeated conflicts with the Spaniards and Portuguese,\r\nand their jealousy of the Guaycurus, who they now found were not less\r\npowerful upon the waters than in the field.\r\n\r\nThe Guaycurus persevered in the same hostility, although less frequent\r\nand less destructive, as will presently be detailed, till the year\r\n1791, when the principal captains of this nation, Emavidi Channe, who\r\nassumed the name of Paulo Joaquim Ferreira, and Queyma, who took the\r\nname of Joam Queyma d’Albuquerque, accompanied by seventeen of their\r\nwarriors, with a Brazilian creole, their slave or prisoner, for an\r\ninterpreter, spontaneously came to solicit peace at Villa Bella, where,\r\nin the palace of the governor, and in the presence of the senate, they\r\nmade a treaty of perpetual friendship and alliance, agreeing to become\r\nthe vassals of his faithful Majesty. Letters-patent, securing to them\r\nthe necessary privileges, were granted, which shall be transcribed\r\nwhen we conclude the history of this important nation. We will now\r\nreturn to the proceedings of the Paulistas, in reference to the early\r\ncolonization of this province.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1727, the governor Menezes arrived at the new arraial, and\r\ngave it the title of Villa Real (royal town) of Cuiaba. The following\r\nyear he left this town, and proceeded up the river Tocoary, to which\r\nwas transferred, in 1729, the navigation from the Embotatiu, with the\r\nintention of avoiding, at least in part, the attacks of the Indians.\r\nFrom this change, however, no advantage resulted, in consequence of the\r\ntrifling distance between these two rivers. The first division which\r\nleft Cuiaba in the year 1730, with upwards of sixty arrobas (thirty-two\r\npounds each) of gold, accompanied by Doctor Antonio Alvez Peixoto, who\r\nhad accomplished the period of his ouvidorship, was attacked in the\r\nPantanos,[21] by an armada of eighty war canoes, manned by more than\r\neight hundred Indians. The pillage lasted for a considerable time, and\r\nonly seventeen Christians escaped by swimming to land. It was computed\r\nthat these warlike Indians lost more than four hundred combatants on\r\nthis occasion. Some gold, which they carried off, with many prisoners,\r\nthe Payagoas parted with at such a low price in the city of Assumption,\r\nthat an Indian exchanged, with one Donna Quiteria de Banhos, six\r\npounds weight for a pewter plate. At this period, a singular branch of\r\ncommerce flourished in this city, which was in the disposal of cats, at\r\nexorbitant prices; the first pair of those animals that were brought to\r\nAssumption were sold for one pound of gold, and their progeny at thirty\r\noitavas, and so on, till the augmentation of this race proportionably\r\nreduced their value. The extraordinary value of cats in this place, was\r\noccasioned by the houses and stores of Indian corn, &c. being infested\r\nwith prodigious swarms of rats.\r\n\r\nIn 1730, the Brigadier Antonio de Almeida sent various persons, in\r\ntwo canoes of war, to procure a quantity of the sugar cane, which had\r\nbeen observed two years previously, by some certanistas, growing upon\r\nthe borders of the river St. Lourenço. This party returned, at the\r\nexpiration of two months, with a considerable supply of the cane, of\r\nwhich a plantation was formed, and it prospered so abundantly, that\r\nin the following year there were numerous planters. The juice of the\r\ncane was generally distilled into spirit, and the demand for it was\r\nso great, that a flagon of it sold at first for ten oitavas of gold.\r\nFrom the use of this spirit, the pallid aspect of the people gave way\r\nto a better complexion; and the diminution of fevers, as well as the\r\nmortality amongst slaves, became rapidly manifest.\r\n\r\nIn this same year, an armament of thirty canoes of war and fifty\r\ntransports, with six hundred men, two pieces, and a great number of\r\nmuskets, were despatched in pursuit of an enemy’s squadron, which had\r\nadvanced to the mouth of the Cuiaba, where it made some fishermen\r\nprisoners. This armada having proceeded to the mouth of the Embotatiu,\r\na division of the Indians was descried, which, with loud yellings,\r\nsuddenly disappeared. After a pursuit of several days’ voyage, which\r\ncarried it beyond the strait where the waters of the Paraguay are\r\ncompressed between two morros, (large rocks,) the armada one morning\r\nunexpectedly encountered an Indian fleet. The Indians, giving the\r\nsignal of attack by loud and discordant war-hoops, came furiously to\r\nthe onset; but the thunder of the musketry and pieces, which were\r\ndischarged upon them at the same instant, as quickly produced a\r\nretrograde movement, and they were pursued in their precipitate flight\r\nby the Portuguese, as far as the aldeia of Tavatim, from whence the\r\nlatter returned, after having destroyed a great many canoes found there.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1732, all the canoes accomplished their destination with\r\nsafety; but in the following year, a fleet, consisting of fifty canoes,\r\nwas destroyed, and on the arrival of the few persons who escaped at\r\nCuiaba, a squadron of thirty canoes of war, and seventy of transport,\r\nwas equipped, and confided to the command of Lieutenant-General Manuel\r\nRodrigues de Carvalho.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of August, 1734, this powerful fleet entered the\r\nParaguay, and having navigated a month without encountering an enemy,\r\nthey one morning discovered at day-break various fires at the bottom\r\nof a bay, apparently difficult of access, towards which, however,\r\nthey proceeded in great silence, without being observed, till they\r\narrived almost within gun-shot. The Indians, perceiving themselves thus\r\nsurprised and surrounded, raised a most horrible yell, to which the\r\nPortuguese responded by a discharge of upwards of four hundred muskets,\r\nwhich occasioned great havoc amongst them. Two hundred and ninety-two\r\nwere made prisoners, including wounded and children, who could not\r\nfollow the fugitives to the woods. The whole were shortly afterwards\r\nbaptized.\r\n\r\nIn 1735, after the return of this armament from the Paraguay, and the\r\narrival of a fleet from St. Paulo, consisting of one hundred and twelve\r\ncanoes, the mines were divided which Fernando de Barroz (a Sorrocabano)\r\nhad discovered three years before, a short distance from the present\r\nsite of Villa Bella, the capital of this province, and where the new\r\ncolonists died in great numbers from a malignant fever, caused by some\r\nneighbouring stagnant pools. In the following year the numerous fleet\r\nfrom St. Paulo was attacked by an Indian armada, considerably superior,\r\nat the situation of Caranda, on the day of St. Joze. The conflict\r\nlasted several hours, in which were killed, amongst others, their brave\r\ncommandant Pedro de Moraes and Frey Antonio Nascentes, a Franciscan\r\nfriar, whose extraordinary powers and intrepidity had acquired him the\r\nby-name of Tiger. Many others distinguished themselves more fortunately\r\nin this conflict, from which they issued conquerors, having caused\r\na horrible carnage amongst the savages. None, however, displayed\r\nmore bravery than a mulatto, from Pindamonhangaba, called Manuel\r\nRodriguez, and, vulgarly, Manduassu, Manuel the Great, in consequence\r\nof his immense stature, strength, and courage. This gigantic man, who\r\ncommanded his own canoe, in which he was accompanied by his wife, of\r\nthe same colour, and various slaves, being attacked by two Indian war\r\ncanoes, defended himself with such valour and dexterity that neither\r\nwere able to board him; at one time he discharged a musket, which his\r\nwife successively loaded for him, at another he wielded a _vara_,\r\n(a long pole for impelling the canoe,) the strokes of which were fatal\r\nto all those who came within his reach. On his arrival at Cuiaba he was\r\npresented with the commission of a captain.\r\n\r\nIn the same year a road was opened to the territory of Goyaz, (so\r\ncalled from the Goya Indians,) from whence upwards of fifteen hundred\r\npersons departed, with horses and numerous troops of mules, besides\r\nthose who descended by the river St. Lourenço, attracted by the\r\nannouncement of gold which had been found in Matto Grosso, from whence,\r\nin fact, eighty arrobas of that metal were despatched the same year\r\nto St. Paulo in eight canoes of war, each furnished with sixteen\r\nchosen men, and commanded by Lieutenant-General Manuel Rodrigues de\r\nCarvalho, who conducted them in security, and put an Indian division to\r\nflight which attacked them at the entrance of the Pantanos. With this\r\nintelligence almost the whole population of Cuiaba left that town for\r\nthe newly-discovered mines of Matto Grosso, (Large Woods.) Five hundred\r\noitavas were paid for negroes, and they were cheap, from the gain which\r\nthey afforded.\r\n\r\nIn 1740 the Indians were again beaten, at the embouchure of the\r\nTacoary, by the fleet from St. Paulo, commanded by Jeronimo Gonsalves,\r\n(an Hituan,) who arrived at Matto Grosso with a great number of lances,\r\nor spears, that belonged to the Indians who perished in the combat,\r\nhe having himself lost four canoes laden with merchandise and slaves.\r\nAfter his arrival some domestic Bororo Indians brought intelligence\r\nthat the Spanish Jesuits had established themselves near the heads of\r\nthe Paraguay, reducing into aldeias the Guaraparez tribe.\r\n\r\nIt being well known that this step was not taken for want of Indians\r\nto convert in the vicinity of their own missions, the Portuguese\r\ncounselled them to retire peaceably, which advice was disregarded. The\r\ninconstancy, however, of the catechumens obliged the catechists to\r\nretrace their steps to the aldeias of the province of St. Cruz de la\r\nSierra, before measures were taken for their expulsion.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1742 Manuel de Lima descended, with five Indians, three\r\nmulattoes, and a negro, in a canoe, by the Guapore, Madeira, and\r\nAmazons, to the city of Para.\r\n\r\nAt the same period that Manuel de Lima descended the Madeira, one\r\nJoaquim Ferreira, with other traders, advanced up the Mamore to the\r\nmission of Exaltaçao. The same persons, or others with a similar\r\nintention, returning the following year, found the mission of St. Rosa\r\nnewly erected upon the eastern margin of the Guapore, almost in front\r\nof the outlet by which they had entered to St. Miguel the preceding\r\nyear. The jesuitical curate determining to impede their navigation\r\nof the river, it was conjectured that, for the better effecting this\r\nproject, he shortly afterwards removed the mission of St. Miguel also\r\nto the same side, and founded that of St. Simao further to the north.\r\nIt notwithstanding appears that the people of Matto Grosso did not\r\ndesist from the navigation of this river.[22]\r\n\r\nIn 1743 the combined Indians observing certain signals at the mouths\r\nof the Tocoary of a fleet having passed forward, they proceeded up in\r\npursuit of it as far as the _reducto_ of Sappe, in the vicinity of\r\nthe town of Cuiaba, where they killed some fishermen.\r\n\r\nA series of such calamities produced a resolution of the ouvidor, Joam\r\nGonsalves, in a junta with the senate and the principal persons of the\r\ntown, to endeavour to obviate hostilities, through the medium of a\r\nfirm friendship with the Guaycuru Indians, they not being considered\r\nso inveterate against the Portuguese, whose maledictions fell upon the\r\nPayagoa tribe, attributing to them alone all the injuries they had\r\nsustained. With this intention, a squadron of six canoes of war and\r\nsix of transport, was sent, under the command of Captain Antonio de\r\nMedeiros, with a considerable quantity of articles most esteemed by the\r\nIndians, equally for the purpose of making presents as to exchange for\r\nhorses. Having arrived at an island in front of a post occupied by the\r\nGuaycurus, the commandant sent an Indian, versed in their language,\r\nwith two white soldiers, to the chief of the party, soliciting him to\r\ncome to the island, as he was desirous to make him some presents, and\r\nto enter into a negotiation. On the following day the Indian captain\r\npresented himself, with a numerous band of men and women, upon the\r\nbeach nearest to the island, and with the three deputies sent two of\r\nhis to Medeiros requesting him to come and parley on land, the two\r\nIndians to remain as hostages upon the island. Medeiros immediately\r\nproceeded to the other side with a considerable part of his force,\r\nand an assortment of various articles, with which he complimented the\r\ncaptain and his relations. He then proposed the projected negotiation,\r\nwhich was to effect a cessation of hostilities with the Payagoas, and\r\nto barter horses for European merchandise; to all which the Indian\r\npromptly assented.\r\n\r\nOn the following day a large party of Portuguese passed to the other\r\nside, in order to traffic with the Indians, without any kind of arms,\r\nimprudently confiding in the apparent demonstrations of sincerity which\r\nthey had evinced; when, about nine o’clock, those who had remained with\r\nMedeiros in the squadron perceived a tumult amongst the savages, which\r\nconvinced them that their comrades were lost. They immediately fired\r\nupon them, when the traitors instantly fled, fifty Christians remaining\r\ndead upon the field. This disaster terminated all hopes of a friendly\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nIn 1744 the Indians were routed by the Paulista fleet, without the\r\nChristians sustaining more loss than one negro, from the wound of a\r\nlance. Notwithstanding the disaster which the savages experienced on\r\nthis occasion, they boldly advanced up the Paraguay the same year, as\r\nfar as the passage from Cuiaba to Matto Grosso; and, disembarking at an\r\nearly hour near the establishment of Joam d’Oliveira, set fire to his\r\nhouse, and killed several people.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of September, in this year, at mid-day, in clear weather,\r\na subterraneous noise was heard, and the earth immediately quaked,\r\ncontinuing to experience various tremulous agitations, which produced\r\nconsiderable alarm in all places of Matto Grosso and Cuiaba. At this\r\nperiod, a drought already prevailed, which lasted till 1749. All\r\nthe woods were parched up, and no longer exhibited any foliage; the\r\natmosphere was now only the vehicle of smoke; all living creatures\r\nsuffered from famine and other calamities; and death stalked in\r\nuniversal triumph.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake, which, in October two years afterwards, 1746, agitated\r\nthe territory of Peru, and destroyed the city of Lima, its capital,\r\nwas here very sensibly felt; filling every living creature with sudden\r\ndread, but unattended with worse consequences.\r\n\r\nBefore the conclusion of this same year, the Captain Joao de Souza,\r\ndescended the Arinos, Tapajoz, and the Amazons, to Para, and returned\r\nthe following year by the Madeira, with European merchandise; after\r\nhis arrival, other dealers departed by the same route, which has been\r\nfrequented to this day, in spite of the great difficulties to which\r\nthis prolonged voyage has hitherto been subject.\r\n\r\nTwo years had almost elapsed, before the rains had reanimated the face\r\nof the country, given verdure to the foliage of the unbounded woods,\r\nrenovated the springs, arrested the ravages of death, and facilitated\r\njourneys by land; when, about the beginning of January, 1751, a\r\nnumerous fleet arrived at Cuiaba, accompanied by Don Antonio Rolin de\r\nMoura, as governor of the new province, a Juiz de Fora, (Theotonio\r\nde Sylva Gusmao,) two Jesuits, and a troop of dragoons. At the end\r\nof this year, the governor proceeded to the mines of Matto Grosso,\r\nwith the intention of promoting the navigation discovered by Manuel\r\nde Lima to Gram Para, and to compel the retrocession of the Spanish\r\nJesuits established on the right margin of the Guapore. D. Antonio\r\nRolin, commanded to found a town in the situation best adapted for\r\nthe effectuating those projects, selected for its site a place called\r\nPouzoalegre, founded and named it on the 19th of March, 1752; and, on\r\nthe 25th of November, by order of the bishop of Rio de Janeiro, the\r\nhermitage of St. Anna was converted into its mother church.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the roads to Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, and with\r\nthe new navigation of Gram Para, that of Camapuan began to be less\r\nfrequented. The miners who were interested in proceeding to St. Paulo\r\nby this fatal way never accomplished it, except with a considerable\r\nnumber of canoes, equipped with chosen men, and armed with the best\r\ninstruments of defence; and occasionally accompanied by canoes of war\r\nto a certain situation in the river Tocoary, where they waited for the\r\nPaulista fleet to protect them through the passage of the Pantanos.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the separation, already mentioned, of the two nations,\r\none of the most disastrous hostilities which the Portuguese\r\nexperienced from the Guaycurus was in May, 1775, when they proceeded\r\nup the Paraguay, in twenty canoes, nearly to Villa Maria, where they\r\nassassinated sixteen persons, and carried off many others prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the prezidio, or garrison, of Nova Coimbra, in the\r\nsame year, upon the western margin of the Paraguay, ought to have been,\r\naccording to the order of General L. d’Alburquerque, forty leagues\r\nfurther to the south, at the place called Fecho dos Morros, where it\r\nwould have contributed to the protection of the navigators of St.\r\nPaulo. The author of the Guaycurus, (written in this prezidio by one\r\nof its governors,) says, that he could but partially embarrass the\r\npassage of the Indians, or prevent the flight of deserters; and that\r\nits founder had committed an error, from whence resulted the entrance\r\nof the Spaniards into the dominions of his faithful Majesty, where they\r\nfounded Villa Real, St. Carlos, and St. Joze.\r\n\r\nThe last hostility which the Portuguese sustained from the Guaycurus,\r\nwas the atrocious assassination of fifty soldiers in a plain fronting\r\nNova Coimbra, in January, 1781, at the time they were bartering some\r\narticles with the barbarians who had been there twice before with\r\ndemonstrations of friendship.\r\n\r\nThe prezidio of Nova Coimbra was besieged in September, 1801, by the\r\nSpaniards, who proceeded from the city of Assumption with four escunas\r\nand twenty canoes. It was the first time that the thunder of contending\r\nartillery had been heard in the centre of South America, and from which\r\nthe Guaycuru and Payagoa warriors formed an idea of the European mode\r\nof warfare. The commencement of hostilities produced the following\r\ncorrespondence between the Spanish and Portuguese commandants:--\r\n\r\n“I had the honour, last evening, to contest the fire of the fort under\r\nthe command of your Honour; and having ascertained that the force with\r\nwhich I am about to attack it is much superior to that of your Honour,\r\nwhich cannot fail to reduce it to the ultimate state of misfortune; and\r\nas the vassals of his Catholic Majesty know how to respect the laws\r\nof humanity, an opportunity is offered, and your Honour is required to\r\nsurrender the fort to the arms of the King my master; on the contrary\r\nthe cannon and the sword will decide the fate of Coimbra, and its\r\nunfortunate garrison will suffer all the extremities of war, from which\r\ncalamity it will see itself delivered, if your Honour complies with my\r\nproposal. Furnish me with your decision categorically, in the course\r\nof one hour. On board of the Escuna, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, 17th of\r\nSeptember, 1801.\r\n\r\n                                            “DON LAZARO DA RIBERA.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                    “Coimbra, 17th September, 1801.\r\n\r\n“I have the honour to reply categorically to your Excellency, that the\r\ninequality of force always was a stimulus which greatly animated the\r\nPortuguese not to forsake their posts, and to defend themselves to the\r\ntwo extremities, either of repelling the enemy, or burying themselves\r\nbelow the ruins of forts confided to them. In this resolution are all\r\nthe individuals of this prezidio, who have the distinguished honour of\r\nseeing in front of it the exalted person of your Excellency, whom God\r\npreserve.\r\n\r\n                                        “RICARDO FRANCO D’ALMEIDA.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe assailants withdrew with some loss, after being nine days\r\nineffectually attempting to carry the fort.\r\n\r\nThis province, which lies between the parallel of 7° where it joins\r\nthat of Para, and 24° 30′ of south latitude where it borders upon that\r\nof Paranna, occupies a territory of nearly eleven hundred miles from\r\nnorth to south, with almost eight hundred at its greatest width, being\r\nmore extensive than ancient Germany.\r\n\r\nOn its western limits it has the Spanish possessions, from which\r\nit is separated by the rivers Guapore, Jauru, and Paraguay, and on\r\nthe eastern the river Paranna, which divides it from the province\r\nof St. Paulo, and the Araguaya, which separates it from that of\r\nGoyaz. It comprises nearly four climates, entering twenty leagues\r\ninto the temperate zone. A country so extensive necessarily admits\r\nof a considerable variety in every point of view in which it can be\r\nregarded. Nature itself has partitioned it into three grand districts,\r\nor comarcas, of which two are divided into six smaller ones, and their\r\nlimits (also natural) will become, perhaps, on some future day, those\r\nappropriated for the formation of the same number of ouvidorias, when\r\nthe accumulation of its population may render such a measure desirable.\r\n\r\n    The southern district is denominated Camapuania.\r\n\r\n                                   { Matto Grosso, on the west.\r\n    The central district comprises { Cuiaba, central.\r\n                                   { Bororonia, on the east.\r\n\r\n                                    { Juruenna, on the west.\r\n    The northern district comprises { Arinos, central.\r\n                                    { Tappiraquia, on the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _District of_ CAMAPUANIA.\r\n\r\nThe rivers Tocoary, Cochim, Camapuan, and Pardo, the origin of which\r\napproximating, the three first flowing westward and the last eastward,\r\nseparate the district of Camapuania into north and south, the northern\r\nlimits of which is a chain of mountains, that in the latitude of about\r\n13° extend themselves from east to west, and from whence emanate the\r\nParaguay and its first branches to the southward, and those which form\r\nthe Tapajos and the Zingu to the northward.\r\n\r\nThis district, which derives its name from the river Camapuan, is\r\nbounded on the west by the river Paraguay; on the south by the Chichuhi\r\nand Igurey; on the east by the Paranna; and comprises a tract of\r\nterritory of upwards of three hundred and fifty miles square. It is\r\na country almost universally flat, and has its woods chiefly in the\r\nvicinity of the rivers. It consists principally either of catingas (not\r\nadapted to agriculture) or plains, and is irrigated by a great number\r\nof rivers, the most considerable of which originate in a range of land\r\nfrom north to south, of very trifling elevation, and denominated the\r\nserra Amambuhi, dividing the canton into east and west. A vast portion\r\nof the western part is annually submerged by the inundations of the\r\nParaguay, which in some parts covers more than seventy miles of plain.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Gold, calcareous stone, granite, variety of\r\nargils, diamonds, and other precious stones.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--The vegetable on which the cochineal breeds, and\r\nthe shrub which produces matte, are very common in various situations;\r\na diversity of palm trees, caju-nut trees, four sorts of excellent\r\n_guabiroba_ fruit, three of the _uvaspiriticas_, the fruit\r\nsimilar to a grape, and the plant to the strawberry. The Paraguaynians\r\nmake various beverages of it.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The Tocoary, Pardo, Mondego, Igatimy, Correntes,\r\nIppanne Guaçu, Miamaya, Ivinheima, and the Negro, are the principal.\r\n\r\nThe river Pardo, (Grey,) so called from the colour of its waters, is\r\nformed by the Sanguexuga and the Vermelho. The latter, of a green\r\ncolour, partaking of the hue of its bed, is small, and flows from the\r\nnorth. The Sanguexuga, (the Leach,) so called from passing near a lake\r\nwhere they are excellent, originates a few miles to the south-west of\r\nthe Camapuan, and is navigable for the space of five or six leagues.\r\nIts water is crystalline and excellent as far as the confluence with\r\nthe former. The Pardo is considerable, and so rapid that canoes advance\r\nagainst its stream by the use of the vara with great labour; water\r\nfalls and currents increasing more and more from its centre upwards,\r\nwhich render the navigation more tedious than any other river which\r\nthe Cuiabanos navigate, who consume almost two months in proceeding up\r\nto the situation where the navigation of only two hundred and eighty\r\nmiles terminates, computing by water. Its course is winding towards\r\nthe south-east, through delightful plains at the commencement, where\r\nthe navigator passes the white deer, _anta_, _tamandua_,\r\nwild hog, wolf, fox, emu ostrich, _seriema_, partridge, &c. which\r\ninvite him to the diversion of shooting.\r\n\r\nThese plains continue to the falls of Caiuru Guaçu and Caiuru Mirim,\r\nwhich are situated about the middle of the extent of this river, with\r\nan interval of three miles one from the other. From this situation\r\ndownwards, both margins are clothed with woods, abounding more in honey\r\nthan fruits, and only one small fall or current is met with, called\r\nCapoeiras, eighteen miles below that of Caiuru Mirim.\r\n\r\nThe principal falls of this river are the Caiuru Guaçu, Tijuco,\r\nTacoaral, Tamandua, Curao, which is the largest of the whole, and\r\nnear fifty palms in height, Ballo, Lage Grande, Lage Pequena, Banco\r\nGrande, Banco Pequena. In passing these, the canoes are conveyed by\r\nland;--Caiuru Mirim, Banquinho, Cirga Comprida, Empirucu, Mangaval,\r\nCirga do Campo, Manuel Rodrigues, Sucuri, Embirucu Mirim, another\r\ncalled Embirucu, Paredao, Furado, Formigueiro, Pedras d’Amolar,\r\nVermelho, Tocoarapaia, past all which canoes are dragged by a warp,\r\nwith but half a cargo, and double the number of people. There are\r\nothers passed with full cargoes, the canoes being impelled by a greater\r\nor less number of men.\r\n\r\nUpon the banks of the Pardo, two sorts of the palm are seen, which are\r\nnot met with near any of the other rivers of the Cuiabana navigation.\r\nOne called _guacuman_, slender and six or seven feet in height,\r\nof which a good bait for fish is made; the other, denominated\r\n_brutiz_, is high and thick with leaves seven feet long. The\r\nIndians, and also the ancient certanistas, made of its fruit a wine,\r\nvery similar to that of the red grape in colour and taste.\r\n\r\nThe principal rivers which enlarge the Pardo are the Anhanduhi Guaçu,\r\nAnhanduhi Mirim, and Sucuri; they join it by the right margin. The last\r\nand smallest disembogues fifty miles below the Vermelho. The first,\r\nrising in the centre of the province, discharges itself into the Pardo,\r\nseventy miles above its embouchure. The Anhanduhi Mirim enters it forty\r\nmiles below the Sucuri. Fifteen miles above the mouth of the Vermelho,\r\nis the port of Sanguexuga on the left margin of the river of the same\r\nname, where the canoes, which proceed up the river Pardo, are unloaded\r\nand conducted in _carretas_, (a sort of cart with four wheels,\r\ndrawn by six or seven bullocks,) across an isthmus of near ten miles\r\nin width, through plains and woods to the port of Camapuan, on the\r\nleft bank of the small river of that name, which originates near the\r\nfirst, in the skirts of the serro of Sacco. From hence, the navigation\r\nis only with half a cargo, and accomplished with prodigious labour (in\r\nconsequence of the shoals and stones of which this river is full) to\r\nthe Cochim, where the goods are deposited in _ranchos_, and well\r\nguarded, until the remainder of the cargoes are fetched. Forty miles\r\nare reckoned from the port to the mouth of this river, traversing woods\r\ndeficient in fruits and game.\r\n\r\nThe river Cochim, which originates in the vicinity of the Sanguexuga,\r\nruns violently between sides, formed of steep and frightful rocks,\r\nwhich in some places are narrowed to four or five fathoms; in other\r\nparts it passes through extensive woods, affording little fruit,\r\nbut abounding in game, where two sorts of palm trees, in great\r\nquantities, are observed, the one called _guacuriz_, the other\r\n_bocayuvas_. The principal of twenty-two falls, which interrupt\r\nthe navigation of this river, are, Mangaval, five leagues below the\r\nmouth of the Camapuan; Pedra Branca, near thirty miles below the\r\npreceding; and Vare, all requiring double the number of persons to\r\npass; Culapada, Furnas, Canellas d’Andre Alvez, Avanhandavussu, and\r\nAvanhandavu Mirim, two miles distant from each other; P. Luiz Antonio,\r\nwhich is very perilous; Jiquitaya; and Cachoeira da Ilha, which is\r\nthree miles above the confluence of this river with the Tocoary. The\r\nprincipal streams which enlarge the Cochim are the Inferno, (Infernal\r\nRiver,) Sellada, and the Jauru, entering by the right margin; the\r\nFurado, Orelha d’Anta, Joam Bicudo, and the Tocoary Mirim, by the left.\r\nThe latter enters near the embouchure of the Cochim.\r\n\r\nThe Tocoary has its heads near the boundary of Cayaponia, much to\r\nthe north of Camapuan. When it receives the Cochim, it is already\r\nconsiderable, and near this confluence there is a large fall of its\r\nname, where the canoes are relieved of half the cargo, in order to\r\npass it without danger. A little lower there is another small one,\r\ndenominated Belliago, the last of this river, (the ordinary width of\r\nwhich is here about sixty fathoms,) and also the last of one hundred\r\nand thirteen, which navigators encounter from Port Feliz to Cuiaba.\r\nThe greater part of its course is through campinhas, with little wood,\r\ndescribing continual and short turnings, which give it an appearance to\r\nthe navigator of his always being enclosed within a lake. It abounds in\r\nfish; but its waters are impregnated with a fine sand. Amongst other\r\nislands, which it forms, is that of Passaros, (or Birds,) so called on\r\naccount of the infinite number that breed in it, and with which its\r\ntrees are always laden: it discharges into the Paraguay, through many\r\nchannels, which form a great number of islands, generally submerged\r\nduring the floods of either river. These islands are denominated\r\nPantanos, where, amongst other rare birds, is seen a beautiful one\r\ncalled _anhupocas_. It is the size of the _inhuma_, having\r\nalso, like it, a horn upon the head, and spurs to the wings; it sings\r\nfrom midnight till day. Wild geese are exceedingly numerous, and for\r\ntheir exclusive sustenance nature here produces a prodigious quantity\r\nof wild rice, and of so large a size that no other bird can swallow it.\r\nAmongst other remarkable trees, on the margins of this river, the most\r\nesteemed is a species of palm tree, thicker round the trunk than the\r\narms of a man can compass; its nuts, which are the size of an ostrich’s\r\negg, supply the aliment of the Indian.\r\n\r\nThe river Mondego, otherwise Embotateu, originally Aranbahi, is\r\nconsiderable, and navigable nearly to its origin, which is a short\r\ndistance from that of the Anhanduhi Guaçu, and runs into the Paraguay\r\neighteen miles below the Tocoary. The largest of its tributaries, which\r\nenter by the right margin, is now called the river Verde. The last\r\nconfluent of the Mondego, by the southern bank, is the small river\r\nZezere, which rises near the inconsiderable serra of St. Barbara.\r\n\r\nThe Ivinbeima, which enters the Paranna by three mouths, flows from the\r\ninterior of the province, whither it affords navigation; and receives\r\nby the left the Jaguary, a river little inferior to it.\r\n\r\nThe Negro, which is considerable, and would appear to be the Sambambaya\r\nof the first certanistas, runs into the Paranna twenty miles above the\r\nnorthern mouth of the Ivinheima.\r\n\r\nThe Miamaya, or Miamay, which is considered to be the river formerly\r\ncalled Amambahy, is large, and enters the Paranna forty miles below the\r\nsouthern arm of the Ivinheima.\r\n\r\nThe Igatimy, to which is given one hundred and fifty miles of extent,\r\nis navigable very near to its source in the serra Amambahy. Eighty\r\nmiles in a direct line from its embouchure is the passage of the\r\nGuaycurus, where the river is shallow. Twenty miles lower it receives\r\non the left the small river Bogas; and thirty-five miles further, on\r\nthe same side, the Escopil, which is little inferior, and flows from\r\nthe same serra.\r\n\r\nThe name of this fine confluence is Forquilha. It is an advantageous\r\npoint for the establishment of a colony. From hence to the Paranna, the\r\ndistance is about thirty-five miles, with only two falls. Ten miles\r\nabove this point, the first of twenty-one falls is encountered, all of\r\nthem compressed within the space of ten miles; from these cataracts\r\nupwards, the river has no interruption to a little above the Guaycuru\r\nford, already mentioned. The course is winding, the lateral lands low,\r\nand covered with impervious woods.\r\n\r\nThe Correntes, which appears to be the same that the Spaniards called\r\nRio Branco, (White River,) is considerable, and enters the Paraguay\r\nfifty miles below the _Fecho dos Morros_, (closing of Rocks.)\r\n\r\nThe Ipanne Guaçu, after having watered an uninhabited territory, falls\r\ninto the Paraguay one hundred miles below the Correntes.\r\n\r\nAt no great distance from the Igatimy are the heads of two small rivers\r\ncalled (the northern) Iguaray Assu, and (the southern) Iguaray Mirim,\r\nwhich after uniting, join the Chichuhi, a river that discharges itself\r\ninto the Paraguay, in the latitude of 24° 12′. Neither the treaty of\r\nlimits agreed upon in 1751 or 1777, mention this river, or any other\r\nas the divisionary line; but from the principal origin of the Igurey,\r\nthe ninth article of the latter treaty, says, that the boundary is\r\nto continue in “a direct line, by the highest land, to the principal\r\nhead of the nearest river which enters the Paraguay;” and the Chichuhi\r\nappears to answer best this adjustment. This river is also called\r\nJejuhy, formed, it is said, by the Grande and Pequena Jejuhy, which\r\nafter their junction receives on the left the Coruguaty.\r\n\r\nNearly fifteen miles to the south of the Igatimy, the river Igurey\r\nfalls into the Paranna, which has formed the limits on that side,\r\nbetween the crowns of Spain and Portugal, since the year 1777.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--There are _antas_ of all colours, wolves, white deer, with\r\nall other species of quadrupeds known in the other provinces. The\r\nmiddle of the northern part of this province is called, in the journals\r\nor diaries of the certanistas, Vaccaria, (or Cattle Plains,) in\r\nconsequence of the cattle that were here dispersed when the Paulistas\r\nexpelled the inhabitants of the city Xerez, and of five neighbouring\r\nsmall aldeias, which formed a small province, of which the said city\r\nwas the head. The remainder of these animals, almost extinct from the\r\ndevastations of the wild beast and the hunter, were augmented in 1797,\r\nby those which the Guaycurus carried off, when they plundered the\r\nSpanish plains of the town of Coruguaty; and also by such as escaped\r\nfrom the Coruguatynos, who pursued (to the number of upwards of fifteen\r\nhundred) the barbarian pillagers.\r\n\r\nVarious savage nations have dominion in this country; the Guaycuru\r\nis the most distinguished. At the present day they are divided into\r\nthree bodies; one of which, without any alliance with other nations,\r\nlive along the western margin of the Paraguay, subdivided into various\r\nhordes: the most southern are called Linguas by the neighbouring\r\nSpaniards; and when they infest the aldeias of the province of St.\r\nCruz de la Sierra, are there known by the name _Xiriquanos_;\r\nothers have the appellation of _Cambaz_. Those who possess the\r\neastern vicinity of the same river, constitute the other two bodies;\r\nthe southern are allied with the Spaniards, the northern with the\r\nPortuguese. The Fecho dos Morros, or an approximating situation, is\r\nthe separating line. No difference is remarked of origin, idiom, and\r\nusages, amongst these three portions of Indians, otherwise declared\r\nenemies to each other. The allies of the Portuguese, extending from the\r\nMondego southward, are divided into seven hordes, or large aldeias,\r\ngenerally friends to each other, and without the least difference in\r\nany respect. Chagoteo, Pacachodeo, Adioeo, Atiadeo, Oleo, Laudeo,\r\nand Cadioeo, are the names by which they are distinguished. In none\r\nof these aldeias, which would be better designated as large towns,\r\nare there any acknowledged superior to the rest. Each horde is\r\ncomposed of three classes of persons; the first, are a species of\r\nnoblesse, entitled _captains_, and whose wives and daughters\r\nhave the distinction of _donas_; the second, are denominated\r\n_soldiers_, or men whose military obedience descends from father\r\nto son; and the third, _captives_ or _slaves_, comprising\r\nthe prisoners of war and their descendants. There are but a few of\r\nthe first in each aldeia, the second are very numerous, and the\r\nthird exceed many times the number of the others taken conjointly.\r\nThe captains and soldiers have an intermixed origin, and their title\r\nof gentility is _joage_. The slaves are of various nations,\r\nacquired in war, never undertaken with any other object, than for\r\nthe augmentation of prisoners, in the number of which consists the\r\ndegree of nobility, or distinction of the captains. These irruptions\r\nare exterminatory, taking away the lives of the elder people and the\r\nliberty of the younger. Such youthful captives soon forget their idiom\r\nand customs, and adopt those of the Guaycurus, and never abscond, as\r\ntheir masters do not occupy them in any thing. It is reputed highly\r\ndegrading for a senhor, or lord, to contract marriage with his slave;\r\nthe son treats with contempt the mother who bore him by a slave.\r\n\r\nThe Guaycurus are of medium stature, well made, healthy, robust, and\r\nappear formed to the most painful and laborious undertakings. They eat\r\nmany times in the day, very slowly, and their provisions are generally\r\nover-dressed, and cooked without any attention to cleanliness. They\r\nnever suffer from indigestion. They are most particular in the diet\r\nwhich they use on occasions of their unfrequent indispositions. The\r\nscurvy never makes its appearance, and sudden deaths are never known.\r\nBodily defects are exceedingly rare; blind persons sometimes are seen,\r\nbut none are ever bald. Their teeth are almost universally irregular,\r\nin consequence of not extracting the first teeth of the youth when they\r\nchange them, an omission arising from the tenderness with which they\r\nare treated; but they commonly retain them till death, although black\r\nenough, from the prodigious quantity of tobacco which they use. The\r\nwomen always carry a piece between the under lip and gums. They paint\r\nthe body with the dye of the _urucu_ and _jenipapo_, in which\r\noperation much symmetry is preserved. The youth have no certain usage\r\nin the disposal of their lank hair; the aged shave their heads similar\r\nto the lay Franciscans.\r\n\r\nThe women likewise shave their heads around, and clip the hair, leaving\r\nit three inches in length at the top. Their physiognomy is broad,\r\nand presents nothing agreeable in consequence of the dye which they\r\nintroduce into the skin with thorns, forming lines, that commence at\r\nthe roots of the hair, and terminate at the eyelids or the cheeks,\r\nand in some instances at the chin, where they give it the appearance\r\nof a chess board, an ash colour being so indelibly fixed, that it\r\ncontinues through life. They are usually wrapped up in a large cotton\r\ncloth, from the neck to the feet, striped with various colours; the\r\nmore ostentatious ornament themselves with shells, the mother-pearl\r\nappearing outwards; some have upon them the figure of their horses,\r\nwell drawn in black and white. Below this dress they wear a very wide\r\ngirdle, called an _ayulate_; without which a girl from her birth\r\nis never seen. Ornamental strings of silver, in necklaces and bracelets\r\nfor the arms and legs, and a plate of the same metal at the breast, are\r\ngenerally displayed, for the manufacture of which, a stone anvil and\r\nhammer are used. In former times, these ornaments consisted of wood,\r\nsuch as are yet seen amongst some of the poor.\r\n\r\nEarly in life they become meagre, and their skins, as well as those of\r\nthe men at an advanced age, are remarkably wrinkled.\r\n\r\nThe men have no other clothing than a narrow girdle, or _cinta_\r\nof dyed cotton, which they tie round the middle of the body; and after\r\nthey have had communication with the Europeans, they cover them with\r\nbeads of divers colours, forming different devices. They ornament the\r\nhead, arms, and legs, with plumes, or feathers, of various colours.\r\nThey have the under lip perforated, and a cylinder of wood, almost as\r\nthick as a writing pen, and three inches long, introduced, the richer\r\nclass wearing them of silver; and in their ears, half moons of the same\r\nmetal. The men are diligent in hunting, fishing, gathering honey and\r\nwild fruits, and in the manufacture of arms and canoes, which they call\r\n_noatek_. The women spin, manufacture clothes, and _cintas_,\r\nor girdles of cotton; and make cords, mats, &c. Both sexes occupy\r\nthemselves equally in culinary affairs.\r\n\r\nThey breed all the species of domestic European birds and quadrupeds\r\nintroduced into the country, and some peculiar to this continent,\r\nwith great attention and care, in consequence of which the whole are\r\nparticularly tame.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is held in contempt by them; and meat is their only\r\naliment, which renders their stock of animals not over abundant, with\r\nthe exception of horses, which they never eat. They change the colour\r\nof a green parrot into yellow, by stripping off the plumage, and\r\napplying the dye of the _urucu_, to its unfeathered skin.\r\n\r\nFrom their custom of incessant riding on horseback, their legs are\r\ncrooked. They do not use the saddle or stirrups, nor any substitute for\r\nthem, and their bridles consist of cords. They break their horses in\r\nwater, in order that the rider may not be dismounted, or that his fall\r\nmay be less sensibly felt.\r\n\r\nTheir war-horses are not used for any other purpose, nor do they ever\r\nsell them. The women are mounted on horseback between bundles of dried\r\ngrass upon a cloth which serves at the same time for a housing.\r\n\r\nThe Guaycurus are dreaded and respected by the surrounding nations, in\r\nconsequence of the advantage they have in cavalry in their cruel wars,\r\nand the arms which they use, consisting of a club, or staff, of four\r\nto five spans in length, and an inch in diameter; a lance, somewhat\r\nthicker, and twelve feet long; a _trassado_, or large knife, and\r\nthe bow and arrow. They are equipped with all those arms, when they\r\nproceed upon their war-horses, in the following manner. They encircle\r\nthemselves with a cord, between which and the body, the club is\r\nintroduced on the right side, the trassado on the left; with the left\r\nhand they govern the horse, and with the right wield the lance, which\r\nthey do not use when they carry the bow and arrow. They also use the\r\nlaço in their hunting excursions.\r\n\r\nA year does not elapse without their undertaking campaigns against, and\r\nmaking prisoners of the Guatos, Cayapos, Bororos, Xiquitos, Chamococos,\r\n(the two last are of the province of St. Cruz de la Sierra,) Guaxis,\r\nwho dwell about the heads of the Aranhahy, Coroas, Caiavabas, Guannas,\r\nand other tribes. The Guannas are the most numerous, and amongst them\r\nalone is remarked the cultivation of some hortulans and cotton trees.\r\n\r\nThey content themselves with one wife; but the law is free to both\r\nparties to effect a separation, and contract a new alliance, when one\r\nis disgusted with the other; such separations, however, are very rare.\r\nThe ceremony of marriage consists in a plentiful banquet, accompanied\r\nwith a rude dance.\r\n\r\nThey have a general cemetery, which is a large open structure covered\r\nwith mats, where each family has a part staked off for its use. Above\r\nthe sepulchres of the men are deposited their bows, arrows, and other\r\narms. Those of distinguished warriors are decked with ornaments. Rich\r\nyoung females are decorated as if for the bridal day. They have no\r\nreligion; and, in place of doctors or surgeons, there are certain\r\npersons denominated _Unigenitos_, who are pretended diviners\r\nand superstitious imposters, absolutely destitute of that knowledge\r\nof medicine or cure of diseases, which belongs to other savages less\r\ndistinguished. They cure their patients by smoking or sucking the part\r\naffected, and expectorating into a grave; they do not prescribe any\r\nbeverages.\r\n\r\nThey believe in a creator of all, but to whom they pay no kind of\r\nhomage, nor have recourse upon any urgent occasions; and also an\r\ninferior spirit, endowed with the knowledge of futurity, whom they\r\ndenominate _Nanigogigo_. They admit the immortality of the soul;\r\nbut it would appear, they have no idea of future recompenses being\r\nproportioned to the conduct of life; they imagine that the souls of the\r\ncaptains and unigenitos are in a state of enjoyment after death, and\r\nthat those of the people wander about the cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe unigenitos acquire most credit by their pretended familiarity\r\nwith the Nanigogigo, for which the people consider them privileged.\r\nThe _macauhan_ is a bird which produces much auguration amongst\r\nthe Guaycurus, when its notes are unintelligible to them; upon such\r\noccasions the subsequent night is a season of inconvenience and labour\r\nto the unigenitos, who occupy themselves alternately in lamentable\r\nsingings, or in imitating the notes of various birds, shaking at the\r\nsame time a calabash with little stones in it, and in calling upon the\r\nNanigogigo to interpret the mysterious song of the bird. They practise\r\nthe same artifice when they pretend to know whether an invalid will\r\ndie or recover, and if good or ill success will attend an ensuing war.\r\n\r\nIt is considered a beauty amongst these people to have no hair upon the\r\neyebrows, being particularly careful to extract it on its appearing.\r\n\r\nTheir language abounds with words and phrases of soft and easy\r\npronunciation. The women explain themselves at times differently to\r\nthe men; for instance, in the expression of “Farewell, I am going,”\r\nthe latter say “_sara gigo oipilo_,”--the women, “_sara gigo\r\nioy_.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more remarkable amongst the Guaycurus than the inhuman\r\npractice of the mothers in destroying the embryo on discovering their\r\npregnancy, until they arrive at the age of thirty. The reason of this\r\ncustom is to avoid the inconveniences annexed to the birth and rearing\r\nof their offspring.\r\n\r\nThe streets of their villages or towns are straight and wide, the\r\nhouses are covered with mats of bulrushes, disposed horizontally in\r\ndry weather, and slopingly in wet weather. Many have two and three\r\nmats, one above the other, with more or less interval, as much for the\r\nexclusion of the rain as for the diminution of the heat. They sleep on\r\nthe ground upon hides, and cover themselves with the cloths that the\r\nwomen spread over the two bundles of grass between which they ride on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\nNone of their dwelling places are permanent. They are always near some\r\nriver or lake, and continue whilst there are game, fish, fruits, and\r\npasturage for the cattle. On experiencing any want, in a moment the\r\ntown disappears, and the plains, previously covered with thousands of\r\nanimals, are deserted. The marches of these caravans are grand and\r\ninteresting. On arriving at their destined place, another town rises\r\nalmost in a moment, and the surrounding campos, where scarcely a few\r\ndeer pastured, are on a sudden covered with numerous horses, oxen, and\r\nflocks of sheep.\r\n\r\nThey manufacture an inebriating drink with honey and water, called\r\n_chicha_; and to the rum of the Portuguese they give the name of\r\n_nodak_.\r\n\r\nSome express themselves tolerably in the Portuguese language, and have\r\nmade transitions to the towns or establishments of the province, since\r\nthey received the protection and subjected themselves to the Faithful\r\nCrown, in virtue of which, the following patent, previously alluded to,\r\nwas granted to them.\r\n\r\n“Joam d’Albuquerque de Mello Pereyra e Caceres, of his Majesty’s\r\ncouncil, chevalier of the order of St. John of Malta, governor and\r\ncaptain-general of the capitanias of Matto Grosso and Cuiaba, &c.\r\nmaketh known to all those to whom this my letter patent may come,\r\nthat the nation of Indian Guaycurus, or Cavalleiros, having solemnly\r\ncontracted perpetual peace and friendship with the Portuguese, for\r\na term judicially done, in which the two chiefs, Joam Queyma de\r\nAlbuquerque and Paulo Joaquim Joze Ferreyra, in the name of their\r\nnation, subject themselves and promise a strict obedience to the laws\r\nof his Majesty, in order to be from this day hence forward recognised\r\nas vassals of the same sovereign; I command and order all magistrates\r\nof justice and war, commandants, and all persons of the dominions of\r\nhis Faithful Majesty, to recognise, treat with, and aid them, with all\r\nthe demonstrations of friends. And, for the confirmation of the above,\r\nI have ordered the present Letter Patent to be passed to them, with my\r\nsignature, and sealed with the signet of my arms, in this capital of\r\nVilla Bella, on the 30th July, 1791.”\r\n\r\nThe following words will partly show the difference between the\r\nGuaycuru language and the general lingua.\r\n\r\n                          GEN.

They paint themselves with the dye of the\r\n_urucu_, perforate the under lip, and insert a cylinder of resin,\r\ntransparent as crystal, secured by a small wooden pin at the upper\r\nextremity. The bow and arrow are their arms, made with instruments of\r\nflint and the sharpened teeth of the boar. They cultivate the cotton\r\ntree, the wool of which they spin and weave by a method peculiar to\r\nthemselves. Their vesture consists of a sort of _ponche_, in the\r\nform of a sack, made of a piece of cotton cloth of good width, doubled\r\nand sewed in part at the corners, with an opening to introduce the head\r\nand neck through, also two apertures for the arms, and terminating\r\nin two aprons, with a cord round the waist. In the morning they sing\r\nhymns to the Creator, accompanied with extravagant movements; one of\r\nthem, with the hands clasped and the body bent, making a circular\r\nmovement around the others for a considerable time. Amongst them are\r\nmen who are, or pretend to be, at the same time, surgeons, doctors,\r\ndiviners, and priests, and, like the latter, carry in their hands a\r\ncross, which custom they have unquestionably derived from the first\r\nJesuitical missionaries who penetrated into the country, and who used a\r\n_bordāo_, or staff, (perhaps also as an instrument of defence,) in\r\nthe shape of a cross. In their district there are woods of wild orange\r\ntrees, and prodigious quantities of bees, which do not produce good\r\nhoney, but the wax is better than that of the northern provinces.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the last century, when the plenipotentiaries of Spain\r\nand Portugal established a boundary-mark upon the Jauru, there lived\r\nin the vicinity of the Fecho dos Morros, a nation of Indians, called\r\n_Bayas_, of which, at the present day, there is no intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe povoaçoes in this district are the fazenda of Camapuan, with a\r\nhermitage, situated in 19° 36′ south latitude, and Miranda, a prezidio,\r\nfounded in 1797, about five hundred yards from the right margin of the\r\nriver Aranhahy, near a serra, in a land abounding with game. Upon the\r\ntrack to Camapuan there is a large lake.\r\n\r\nWith the foundation of Nova Coimbra the Spaniards commenced in this\r\nprovince the towns of Villa Real, near the tropic, St. Carlos, on the\r\nmargin of the river Appa, and St. Joze, which was demolished by the\r\nPortuguese about twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nNear the heads of the Aranhahy there yet appears some vestiges of the\r\nbefore-mentioned city of Xerez.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _District of_ MATTO GROSSO.\r\n\r\nThis district, which is two hundred and forty miles from north to\r\nsouth, and two hundred and seventy from east to west on the northern\r\npart, is bounded on the south by the Spanish possessions, on the east\r\nby the Paraguay, on the north by the district of Juruenna, and on the\r\nwest by the Guapore. It extends between 13° and 16° 20′ of southern\r\nlatitude. The face of the country is undulated with serras of no great\r\nelevation, which, however, attract the sight at a great distance,\r\nwith plains more or less extensive, woods, and intermixtures of\r\n_charnecas_, (barren tracts,) and is watered by a great number of\r\nrivers, tributary to the two largest of South America.\r\n\r\nThe most considerable mountains are on the northern part, and are\r\nbranches of the serra of Paricis.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Gold, diamonds, crystals, granite, minerals of iron,\r\npotters’ earth, calcareous stone.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--The _opuncia_ is common in various situations; in others\r\nthe ipecacuanha; indigo grows spontaneously in humid lands; jalap is\r\nwell known; also the trees of cupahiba, _almecega_, or gum-mastich,\r\nmanna, and dragons’ blood. There is a diversity of excellent timber for\r\nbuilding, and abundance of oranges, _goyabas_, _aracas_, _mangabas_,\r\npine-apples, water-melons, and bananas, generally of good quality.\r\nThe objects of cultivation are Indian corn, mandioca, rice, legumes,\r\ntobacco, cotton, and the sugar cane, as far as it is required for the\r\nconsumption of the population.\r\n\r\nEuropean merchandise and some Asiatic productions arrive here at an\r\nexorbitant price, and are only procured in exchange for gold.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--All the species of wild quadrupeds which are encountered in\r\nthe maritime provinces are here common; of domestic animals cattle only\r\nare numerous; sheep are rare; and, hitherto, there are no breeders of\r\nmules. Here are common the emu ostrich, _sereima_, _mutun_, _jacu_,\r\n_tucano_, parrot, partridge, heron, _guiraponga_, and _jaburu_.\r\n\r\nIndustry is very limited; and the weaving of coarse cottons, for\r\nlabourers, and curing of hides, which exceed the demand, are its\r\nprincipal objects up to this period.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The Guapore originates nearly one hundred miles to\r\nthe north-east of Villa Bella, and, after eighty miles of southern\r\ncourse, and nearly the same distance of western, curves towards the\r\nnorth-west, and afterwards to the west-north-west. Two miles above the\r\nsaid town it receives by the left the Alegre, which coming from the\r\neast, and rising in the serra of Aguapehy, is joined on the left by\r\nthe Barbados, ten miles from its mouth. Ten miles below the capital\r\nthe Guapore is united on the right by the river Sarere, which has its\r\nsource thirty miles to the west of it; and fifty miles lower, on the\r\nsame side, by the Galera, which forms itself to the north-west of\r\nthe Sarere. Twenty-four miles further the important river Verde is\r\nincorporated with it; and upwards of one hundred miles in advance, the\r\nriver Paragau; after two hundred more, the Baurus or Baure; and twelve\r\nor fifteen further, the Tunama; all four by the left margin, after\r\nhaving watered a great portion of the province of the Moghos, or Moxos.\r\nUpwards of fifty miles below the mouth of the last river, it is joined\r\nalso on the left side by the voluminous river Ubay, or Ubahy, which the\r\nSpaniards formerly denominated the Chiquitos, as it traversed the lands\r\nof the Indians so called, and subsequently the Magdalena, named St.\r\nMiguel, after they had founded in its vicinity the parishes of those\r\nnames. To the river Guapore the people of Matto Grosso give the name of\r\nMamore, as far as its junction with the large one of that name, which\r\nthey call Madeira and the Spaniards Mamore. This confluence is one\r\nhundred and ten miles lower down, and one hundred and fifty by water.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards commonly give to the Guapore the name of Itenez, which\r\nthey continue to it till its confluence with the real Mamore, where\r\nboth lose their names, and form the majestic Madeira, which flows\r\nnorthward till it incorporates with the mighty Amazons. The margins of\r\nthe Guapore, or Itenez, are principally swampy, and, with the rivers\r\nwhich run into it, uncongenial to European constitutions. The rivers\r\nwhich join it by the right margin, the largest not exceeding one\r\nhundred miles in course, issue from the western side of a continuation\r\nof the serra of Paricis, which prolongs itself with the same river. The\r\nCabixy, Piolho, Corumbyara, Mequen, St. Simam, and Cautario, follow the\r\naforesaid Galera.\r\n\r\nThere are five falls in the Guapore, from the mouth of the Ubahy to\r\nthe confluence where its name is lost. Guajuru-mirim, Guajuru-grande,\r\nBannaneira, Paugrande, and Lages, descending, are the names by which\r\nthey are distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe Jauru, which forms itself in the campos of the Paricis, thirty\r\nmiles east of the Guapore, after flowing a long way southward, gathers,\r\nby the right bank, the Bahia and the Aguapehy, inclines to the\r\neast-south-east, and unites itself with the Paraguay, in the latitude\r\nof 16° 24′. It is navigable for a great distance, and runs principally\r\nthrough a flat country covered with woods. At a short distance from its\r\nmargin, there is a nitrous lake, which furnishes a great quantity of\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nAt the confluence of the Jauru, which is one hundred and seventy\r\nmiles south-east of Villa Bella, a magnificent stone of European\r\nmarble was erected in 1754, as a boundary mark between the Spaniards\r\nand Portuguese; the arms of each power being turned towards their\r\nrespective possessions. This pillar is regarded by the Indians with\r\nadmiration. The following is the inscription upon it.\r\n\r\n                     Sub Joanne Quinto Lusitanorum\r\n                           Rege Fidelissimo\r\n                     Sub Ferdinando Sexto Hispaniæ\r\n                            Rege Catholico\r\n                     Justitia et Pax osculatæ sunt\r\n                      Ex Pactis Finium Regundorum\r\n                   Conventis. Madriti Idib. Januar.\r\n                               M.DCC.L.\r\n\r\nThe river Sepetiva, or Sipotuba, which rises fifty miles to the\r\nnorth-east of the Jauru, runs far along the serra of Tapirapuan, and\r\nunites itself with the Paraguay, after having gathered by the right the\r\nsmall rivers Juva and Jaraubahiba.\r\n\r\nThe river Cabacal, much inferior to the preceding, falls into the\r\nParaguay, a few leagues below the Sipotuba.\r\n\r\nThe Preto, which is the first considerable river that swells the waters\r\nof the Paraguay, is formed by the St. Anna, and St. Francisco Xavier,\r\nwhich emanate from the eastern brows of the Tapirapuan Serra, and join\r\ntheir copious streams at the bottom of a mount, each presenting here\r\nthe interesting spectacle of a large cataract. These barriers prevent\r\nthe advance of various species of fish, large shoals of which are\r\nobserved in the water at their base.\r\n\r\nThe Barbados, which is extensive, issues also from the serra\r\nTapirapuan, and enters the Paraguay, a considerable way below the Preto.\r\n\r\nThe Pary, which took the name of a nation now extinct, originates in\r\nthe serra of Tapirapuan, and falls into the Paraguay, between the\r\nBarbados and Sipotuba.\r\n\r\nAll the rivers of this comarca are of pure, fresh, and crystalline\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nVilla Bella, the capital of this rich and extended province, is already\r\nin a state of mediocrity, abounding with meat and fish, and is\r\nsituated in a champaign country, near the margin of the Guapore. It is\r\nornamented with a parochial church, Santissima Trinidade, a hermitage\r\nof Nossa Senhora of Carmo, another of St. Antonio, and a permutation,\r\nor smelting house. It is the residence of the governor, and this vast\r\nand very partially cultivated province is now under the jurisdiction\r\nof Senhor Majesse. It is also the residence of the ouvidor, who is\r\nlikewise crown judge. The senate is presided by a Juiz de Fora, who\r\nis also procurator of the crown, inspector of the smelting house, and\r\ndeputy of the juntas of the administration of the treasury and of\r\njustice. All the houses are constructed of earth, and white-washed. It\r\nis the only parish of the comarca, and in its wide district are the\r\nchapels of St. Anna, of St. Francisco Xavier, of the Lady of Pilar, of\r\nSt. Vicente Ferreyra, and of Oiro Fino.\r\n\r\nOf this comarca, is the arraial Diamantino, advantageously situated\r\nat the angle of the confluence of the river of the same name, with\r\nthe Oiro, ten miles above its entrance into the Paraguay. It has a\r\nhermitage of the Lady of Conceiçao, filial of the mother church of\r\nCuiaba, from which it is distant one hundred miles to the north-west.\r\nThe gold and diamonds in its environs were the cause of its origin a\r\nfew years ago. Its inhabitants are miners, breeders of cattle, and\r\nagriculturists.\r\n\r\nAbout ten miles distant is the serra of Mangabeira, partly occupied by\r\nvarious farmers of Indian corn, mandioca, and legumes.\r\n\r\nThe northern portion of this comarca is yet possessed by various\r\naboriginal nations, such as the _Cabyxys_, the _Cautaros_, (which\r\ngive their names to two confluents of the Guapore,) the _Ababas_, the\r\n_Lambys_, and the _Urucurunys_, with others approximating to the serra\r\nParicis, which is an elevated range, with extensive sandy campos, or\r\nplains, upon its widely spreading summit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _District of_ CUIABA.\r\n\r\nThis district, which takes the name of the river that traverses it\r\nfrom north to south, is confined on the north by the district of\r\nArinos, on the west by that of Matto Grosso, on the east by that of\r\nBororonia, from which it is separated by the river St. Lourenço, which\r\nalso limits it on the south, where it terminates in an angle formed by\r\nthe confluence of the said river and the Paraguay. It comprises three\r\nhundred and fifty miles from north to south, and little less than two\r\nhundred and fifty at its utmost width from east to west. It has an\r\nagreeable aspect, delightfully varied with spacious plains, superb\r\nwoods, extensive _charnecas_, and gently undulating eminences,\r\noften rising to the grandeur of mountain scenery. The greater portion\r\nis fertilized by numerous rivers. The prevailing thunder showers of the\r\nwinter season commence in September and terminate in April.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--The same minerals are met with here which are found in the\r\ndistrict of Matto Grosso.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--There are a diversity of trees of excellent timber. Amongst\r\nother medicinal plants, is one called _espigelia_, the _herva de\r\ncobra_, (serpent herb) the _jarrinha_, and various qualities of the\r\nreal _quina_, or Jesuits’ bark.\r\n\r\nAmongst other fruits of the wood, the quince is well known, the\r\n_jabuticaba_, the _ambuzo_, the _araticumo_, the _guabiraba_, and the\r\n_goyaba_.\r\n\r\nCotton, sugar, Indian corn, mandioca, rice, and legumes, are objects of\r\nagriculture proportioned to the population.\r\n\r\nFrom no part of this district can the superfluity that is produced be\r\nexported with advantage, in consequence of its present tedious and\r\nintricate communication with the maritime provinces.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--Large herds of cattle are bred, as well as horses, some\r\nmules, hogs, sheep, and a very few goats, which hitherto are deemed\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The most celebrated is the Paraguay, which rises in a plain\r\nupon the serra of Pary, otherwise Lage, (a portion of the extensive\r\nParicis,) at the situation of the Sete Lagoas, so called from an\r\nassemblage of seven lakes, generally small, a short space intervening\r\nbetween them, and communicating by narrow outlets. A little below\r\nthe last, this river flows through a swampy country in a northerly\r\ndirection for a short space, when it winds round by the west and\r\ntakes a southern course. The first stream which it receives is the\r\nDiamantino, (Diamond River,) which comes from a distant source, and\r\nbrings with it the Corrego Rico, (Rich Channel,) otherwise Rio do Oiro,\r\n(Gold River.) The first large river which joins it is the Jauru. Along\r\nits eastern margin, and in nearly the whole of this great extent, is a\r\nrange of elevated lands, which continue twenty-five miles beyond this\r\nconfluence, and terminate at the point called Escalvada, where both\r\nmargins begin to be flat, and interspersed with lakes. Seventy miles\r\nbelow the Escalvada point, the western margin begins to be bordered by\r\na serra of the like number of miles in length, but narrow, and broken\r\nin various parts to admit of the ingress of the waters of three lakes\r\nlying behind it, the outlets of which, thus formed, appear like large\r\nrivers, when the Paraguay at its overflowings makes them a part of its\r\nexpanded channel. The northern portion of this serra is called Insua:\r\nthe southern, Chaynez; and the central, Doirados. The names of the\r\nlakes are Oberaba, Gahiba, and Mandiore. The first on the north is ten\r\nmiles in diameter, and its outlet contiguous to the extremity of the\r\nserra Insua, behind which it communicates with the Gahiba lake, which\r\nis a little larger and ten miles distant to the south, with its outlet,\r\nthe same number of miles below the first, dividing the serra of Insua\r\nfrom that of Doirados.\r\n\r\nThe Mandiore lake is fifteen miles in extent, and has more than one\r\nchannel to the Paraguay, the northernmost of which separates the serra\r\nof Doirados from that of Chaynez, and is twenty miles south of Gahiba,\r\nin front of which the river St. Lourenço discharges its abundant\r\nwaters, in the latitude of 18° 45´.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Chaynez, inhabited at times by the Guanan Indians, is\r\nfollowed by that of Albuquerque, which is a square mass of an elevated\r\nrange from thirty-five to forty miles. On its southern side is situated\r\nthe prezidio from which its name is derived. In front of this serra is\r\nthe principal embouchure of the Tocoary in 19° 15´.\r\n\r\nEighteen miles further to the south are the mouths of the Mondego. The\r\nParaguay flows in these parts divided into two channels, formed by a\r\nnarrow island seventy miles long; the eastern channel is denominated\r\nParaguay Mirim.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles to the south of the Mondego are two high mounts,\r\none in front of the other, upon the margins of the Paraguay. Upon the\r\nsouthern skirt of the western mount is situated the before-mentioned\r\nfort of Nova Coimbra.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles below Coimbra, on the same margin, is the mouth\r\nof the outlet from Bahia Negra, (Black Bay,) which is twenty miles\r\ninland, and comprises eighteen in length from north to south, being the\r\nreceptacle of the lakes, and of the aqueous effusions of the plains\r\nlying to the west and south of the Albuquerque mountains. Sixty miles\r\nfurther the Paraguay receives on the eastern bank the Queyma, which is\r\nsaid to be the Terrery of the first certanistas.\r\n\r\nEight miles lower, in the latitude of 21°, upon the western margin, is\r\nthe morro which the ancient Paulistas called the Mount of Miguel Joze,\r\nupon whose skirt is situated Fort Bourbon. Twenty-five miles by water,\r\nto the south of the mount of Miguel Joze, in the latitude 21° 20´, a\r\nchain of small mountains prolong themselves with the Paraguay, where\r\nits waters are contracted into a narrower space, flowing rapidly in two\r\nchannels, separated by a rocky island of considerable length. In this\r\nsituation, denominated the Fecho dos Morros, (the Barricado of Rocks,)\r\nand which is the limit between the High and Low Paraguay, terminate\r\nthe laky and swampy margins of this majestic river, which commence, as\r\nhas been previously noticed, at Escalvada Point, near three hundred\r\nand fifty miles to the north. The width of the river within this\r\nspace, during the inundations, which begin in April and continue till\r\nSeptember, is from seventy to one hundred and fifty miles, and forms\r\nan internal sea, which the ancient Vincentistas denominated the Sea or\r\nLake Xarays, from a nation so called, now not existing, or, at least,\r\nnot known by such an appellation. At the time of these awful floods, a\r\ngreat part of the beds of the rivers of St. Lourenço, Tocoary, Mondego,\r\nand others on the eastern side, as well as the aforesaid lakes on the\r\nwestern, and the adjacent woods, become portions of this periodical\r\nCaspian, where the elevated lands assume the appearance of islands,\r\ninhabited by an accumulation of birds and wild animals.\r\n\r\nAt the said Fecho, both margins of the Paraguay begin to acquire\r\na solid terra firma, particularly the eastern. By this bank are\r\ndischarged the small Tipoty, the Correntes, the Rio Branco, (which\r\nappears to be the said Correntes,) the Appa, (which is thought to be\r\nthe Pirahy of the ancient Paulistas,) the Guidava, the Ippanne Guassu,\r\nthe Ippanne Mirim, and the Chichuhi, where the rugged margin called\r\nHuguruguita commences, and is prolonged for the space of thirty-five\r\nmiles to the mouth of the small Suobogo, where begins the bank or coast\r\nof Pataque, of short extent, terminating at the embouchure of the\r\nTabixu, which, as well as the preceding, enters the Paraguay on the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nIn the latitude of 25° 22´ is situated the city of Assumption; and\r\neighteen miles to the south of it, the first arm of the large river\r\nPilco Mayo is discovered, which originates in the cordillera of the\r\nAndes, in the district of Potoze, whither it affords navigation. Forty\r\nmiles lower down is the mouth of the second arm, and fifteen further,\r\nthe most southern arm. The course of the Pilco Mayo is not much less\r\nthan seven hundred miles.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern margin, the Piraju, the Cannabe, and the Tibicoary enter\r\nthe Paraguay.\r\n\r\nIn the latitude of 26° 50´, the Rio Verde, or Parsa, otherwise\r\nColorado, discharges itself, after a course of more than seven hundred\r\nmiles from the vicinity of the Andes.\r\n\r\nForty miles further to the south, the grand confluence of the Paranna,\r\nlittle inferior to the Paraguay, augments the wonder which is excited\r\nby so vast a mass of water. About one hundred miles lower is the\r\nnorthern branch of the river Salado; and upwards of one hundred and\r\nseventy miles further the southern, better known by the name of\r\nXalupoi. On the southern angle of this confluence is situated the city\r\nof Santa Fe, in the latitude of 31° 35′. A little further it receives\r\nalso by the right bank, the Terceiro, or Carcapal, which exceeds three\r\nhundred and fifty miles in its course.\r\n\r\nThe Paraguay, which from the parallel of 20° inclines a little to the\r\nsouth-south-west, here changes its direction to the east-south-east for\r\nthe space of one hundred and forty miles, gathering by both margins\r\nvarious rivers, none of them considerable, to the latitude of 34°,\r\nwhere it is united on the left by the river Uruguay, its last important\r\ntributary.\r\n\r\nThis river, which the Spaniards generally call Rio da Plata, after it\r\nreceives the Pilco Mayo, becomes many leagues in width, and contains\r\na great number of islands, which vary greatly in extent, principally\r\nof a flat aspect, and denominated the Parannas. The left margin, from\r\nthe last confluence, runs to the east as far as Cape St. Mary, and\r\nthis part of it, at least, is universally known as the river Plate,\r\nthe right margin of which takes a south-east direction, from the same\r\nlongitude, for more than one hundred miles to the point of Carretas,\r\nwhere its embouchure is upwards of fifty miles in width.\r\n\r\nThe Paraguay has no more falls after it receives the Sipotuba, and is\r\ngenerally of great depth.\r\n\r\nThe river Cuiaba has its origin in the same latitude as the Paraguay.\r\nThe first current which unites itself with it by the western margin\r\nis the Cuiaba Mirim, and by the eastern the Casca; these are followed\r\nby many others of a smaller class, which render it navigable for more\r\nthan seventy miles above the capital, although with much labour, in\r\nconsequence of many falls, which do not extend below Villa Real, where\r\nit begins to be wide and rapid in its current, flowing almost generally\r\nthrough a champaign country, which is submerged during the periodical\r\ninundations. Its waters are excellent, well stored with fish, and in\r\nthe latitude of 17° 20′ it falls into the St. Lourenço.\r\n\r\nWhilst the floods continue it is customary to navigate over the plains,\r\nwhere the current is less rapid, traversing prodigious plantations of\r\nrice, annually reproduced by nature, without any human assistance, or\r\nsustaining any damage from the waters, because it grows as the waters\r\nincrease, always having more than a yard above water, and affording\r\nsupplies to the passing canoes, into which the ears are bent, and then\r\nshook with a pole.\r\n\r\nThe _piranna_ fish, commonly called _tezoira_, (scissors,)\r\nand sometimes _lanceta_, (lancet,) and the _arraya_, are\r\nequally terrible here; the first in consequence of its formidable\r\nteeth, the other from a sting which it has in the tail.\r\n\r\nFrom the capital downwards, the most notable streams which fall into\r\nthe Cuiaba, are the Tutez on the right; the large and small Caranda on\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\nVilla Real de Cuiaba, capital of the comarca, considerable, populous,\r\nflourishing, and abounding with meat, fish, and fruits, contains a\r\nchurch of Senhor Bom Jesus, three chapels dedicated, two also to the\r\nRedeemer, with the titles of Bom Despacho and Passos, and one to\r\nNossa Senhora of Rozario, and is the residence of a prelate, bishop\r\n_in partibus_, also of a Juiz de Fora, and royal professors of\r\nphilosophy and Latin. It is situated near a small river, one mile\r\ndistant from the eastern bank of the river from which it derives its\r\nname. All the edifices are of taipa, similar to those of St. Paulo, and\r\nthe streets are mostly paved.\r\n\r\nThe dealers of Cuiaba proceed to barter their bars of precious metal at\r\nBahia, by the road of Goyaz, or at the metropolis, by the same track,\r\nor by Camapuan; but their trade might more conveniently be carried\r\non by the river Tapajos, and others of Gram Para, to its capital.\r\nVarious ways, in fact, remain to be opened to the transit of the\r\nproductions of these fertile districts; two to Para,--one by the river\r\nXingu, the other by the Mortes and the Araguaya; the same number to\r\nSt. Paulo and Rio de Janeiro,--the first by the rivers St. Lourenço,\r\nPiquiry, Sucuriu, and Tiete,--the second always by land, traversing\r\nthe districts of Bororonia and Cayaponia, crossing the Paranna between\r\nthe confluence of the Parannahiba and the cataract of Urubupunga. The\r\nlatter, it is credibly affirmed, would be near three hundred miles\r\nshorter than the route actually frequented by Villaboa.\r\n\r\nAt Cuiaba, the orange tree is exceedingly abundant, and fructifies with\r\nexcellence the whole year. The water-melon, melon, and pine-apple,\r\nare here very good. The principal productions are mandioca, Indian\r\ncom, feijao, some cotton, and the sugar cane, the juice of which is\r\nprincipally distilled into spirit.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles to the east of Cuiaba is the small arraial and parish\r\nof St. Anna, situated on a plain, upon the serra St. Jeronimo. Every\r\nway that it is approached the ascent is steep and of considerable\r\nlength. Its inhabitants rear cattle, cultivate mandioca, Indian corn,\r\nlegumes, the sugar cane, and some cotton, which is occasionally injured\r\nby the cold, here sensibly experienced in the nights of July. The\r\nsoil has been found well adapted to the growth of wheat, but want of\r\nindustry precludes its cultivation.\r\n\r\nFifty miles to the south-west of Cuiaba is the small arraial of\r\nSt. Pedro d’el Rey, formerly Poconna, situated upon the verge of a\r\nvast lake, with a hermitage, one league distant from the extensive\r\nswamp of Pirannema, which becomes dry in the hot season, and affords\r\npasturage for cattle. The houses are of taipa, or _adobe_, (a\r\nspecies of large brick dried in the sun,) and are white-washed. The\r\nsoil in its environs is green. The people who inhabit it, and form a\r\n_julgado_, or village, are miners, are supplied with water from\r\n_cacimbas_, or pits, for want of fountains, cultivate the common\r\nnecessaries of life, and breed cattle. They also make salt, by the\r\nfiltering of water through a portion of earth put into _bangues_,\r\nwhich are made of hides, and subsequently dried by a strong heat.\r\n\r\nVilla Maria, situated upon the eastern bank of the Paraguay,\r\ntwenty-five miles from the confluence of the Jauru, has a church of St.\r\nLuiz; and is abundantly supplied with meat and fish. The situation of\r\nthis town upon the noble Paraguay, and other circumstances, promise it\r\na future augmentation and splendour, which will perhaps not be equalled\r\nby any other internal town of South America. Its inhabitants, at\r\npresent consisting principally of Indians of various nations, cultivate\r\nIndian corn, mandioca, legumes, rice, cotton, and breed cattle. There\r\nis already one engenho, or sugar-work. The lights universally used are\r\nmade of the oil of _mamona_, and of the _piquira_, a species\r\nof fish exceedingly numerous, and caught with great facility. The fish\r\ncalled _paraputanga_ and _pacu_, are esteemed the best of the\r\nParaguay and of its first confluents.\r\n\r\nIn front of this town is situated the royal fazenda of Cahyssara, where\r\nnumerous droves of cattle and horses are bred, and where a great many\r\ntigers have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe hermitages of Nossa Senhora of Livramento, upon the road of\r\nMatto-Grosso, of Nossa Senhora of Prazeres, near the heads of the\r\nCuiaba, of St. Antonio, below the capital, near the same river, and\r\nothers, are the places of worship of the people who inhabit those\r\ndistricts. Near to the port of the capital, on the eastern bank of the\r\nCuiaba, is a hermitage of St. Gonçalo d’Amarante.\r\n\r\nNear the left margin of the Jatuba, an arm of the St. Lourenço, upon\r\nthe Goyaz road, is the aldeia of Boavista, so called from its fine\r\nsituation upon a height.\r\n\r\nThere still exist various hordes of Indians, (all said to be of the\r\nBororo nation,) dispersed within the limits of this comarca and\r\nthe preceding one. One is designated _Coroados_, the other\r\n_Barbados_, (bearded,) so called from feigning mustachios or\r\nbeards with a certain dye.\r\n\r\nOf the Indian nations here found by the conquerors, the only one worthy\r\nof remembrance was the _Paricis_, who were well formed, affable,\r\nand much pleased with the Christians. From their alliances with the\r\nwhites and Africans are descended a great part of the _Mamalucos_\r\nand _Curibocas_, who constitute the gross of the population. They\r\nare usually of good morals, and much respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _District of_ BORORONIA.\r\n\r\nThis comarca, which borrows its name from the Bororo Indians, who yet\r\nhave dominion over the principal part of it, is bounded on the north by\r\nthe district of Tapiraquia, on the west by that of Cuiaba, on the south\r\nby Camapuania, and on the east by the province of Goyaz, from which it\r\nis divided by the river Araguaya. It is upwards of four hundred miles\r\nin length from north to south, and of proportionate width, although\r\nvery irregular.\r\n\r\nThe _Bororos_, the _Guatos_, and the _Baccahiris_ are its actual\r\npossessors. The Bororos are the most numerous, although greatly\r\ndiminished in comparison with what they were at the commencement of\r\nthe conquest; they are divided into various tribes, under different\r\nappellations. The Guatos, who possess the southern part, and are\r\nfriendly to the Portuguese, are extraordinary swimmers, fish with\r\nthe arrow, and have a great number of canoes, in which they advance\r\nto the Portuguese establishments. The bow, arrow, and a large lance\r\nare their arms; a wide _cinta_, or girdle, manufactured from the\r\nfibres of the _tucum_ palm, is the common vesture of both sexes. The\r\nskin of the ounce generally constitutes their bed, and they are a\r\npeople exceedingly indolent. Honey and game form a main part of their\r\nsubsistence. The Baccahiris, who occupy the lands in the vicinity of\r\nthe river Das Mortes, wage a continued warfare against all kinds of\r\nquadrupeds and birds, their principal aliment. Up to the present time\r\nthis horde has never acted with hostility towards the Christians. They\r\nare said to be of a white complexion and docile, from which they are\r\nsupposed to be a tribe of Paricis.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND LAKES.--The river St. Lourenço, which originates in\r\nthe latitude of about 15°, is already considerable when it traverses\r\nthe road of Goyaz; afterwards, it gathers by the left the Parannahiba,\r\nwhich brings with it the Sucuri, the sources of which are also a\r\ngreat distance to the north of the said road. A little below this\r\nconfluence, where it becomes large, there is a fall, which is the\r\nlast, and from hence it continues to the south-west, through a flat\r\ncountry, augmenting greatly until its incorporation by two mouths with\r\nthe Paraguay, which is not superior to it. The eastern embouchure is\r\ndistinguished by the name of Rio Chaynez.\r\n\r\nForty miles above the mouth of the Cuiaba the St. Lourenço is joined\r\nby the Piquiri, which is larger, has its heads near the boundary of\r\nCayaponia, not far from those of the Sucuriu, and receives on the\r\nright the Piaughuhi, which originates in the same parts; on the left,\r\nthe Itaquira, which has its source in the proximity of that of the\r\nJauri-Guassu, a branch of the Tocoary, already mentioned.\r\n\r\nA few years only have elapsed since an explorer navigated up the\r\nPiquiri seven days, and did not encounter a cataract. Ancient\r\ncertanistas have asserted that the navigation from Porto Feliz to\r\nCuiaba may be accomplished by the Sucuriu and Piquiri. It is, however,\r\ncertain that the voyage from the mouth of the Tiete to the Cuiaba is\r\nmore than one-third shorter than by that of Camapuan.\r\n\r\nThe Rio das Mortes, (River of the Dead,) which took this name in\r\nconsequence of many people of the first bandeira dying upon its margins\r\nfrom fevers, has its numerous heads to the south of the Cuiaba road.\r\nIt runs to the north-east and discharges its considerable volume into\r\nthe western arm of the Araguaya, where it forms the island of St. Anna.\r\nIt affords extensive navigation into the interior of the province.\r\nThe Roncador and the great and small Sangradores are the most remote\r\norigins of this river. The first is the most western, and flows a\r\nshort distance from an arm of the aforesaid Sucuriu. Between the two\r\nSangradores there is a spacious lake, called Logoa Grande.\r\n\r\nThe Rio do Peixe, (River of Fish,) formed by the Raizama and Tacoaral,\r\nwhich also cross the Cuiaba road, there insignificant, flows\r\nnorthwards, and ultimately enters the Rio das Mortes.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles from the Araguaya, near a small stream and the said\r\nroad, is situated the aldeia of Insua, with a register.\r\n\r\nThere existed upon the left margin of the Rio das Mortes, an aldeia,\r\nnamed Amaro Leite after its founder, which disappeared when the road\r\nwas carried in a more direct line further to the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _District of_ JURUENNA.\r\n\r\nThis comarca is bounded on the north by Mundrucania, on the west by\r\nthe rivers Guapore and Madeira, on the south by the comarca of Matto\r\nGrosso, and on the east by the river which affords its name, comprising\r\nnearly four hundred miles from north to south, and much more from east\r\nto west. Between the Pederneiras and Araras falls, in the latitude of\r\n9° 45′, where the river Madeira curves to the west, there is a point\r\non its eastern margin, in front of the mouth of the river Abuna, from\r\nwhich it takes the name, and is the most western land of the Brazil.\r\n\r\nThis comarca is very little known by the Portuguese, and is in the\r\npower of various barbarous nations. The _Pammas_, who possess\r\na considerable portion upon the Madeira, are of a white complexion.\r\nThe _Tamares_ are masters of the adjacencies of the river Juyna,\r\nthe first notable branch of those which enlarge the Juruenna by the\r\nwestern bank. The _Paccahas_ live to the north of the latter. The\r\n_Sarummas_ farther to the north, along the margins of the said\r\nJuruenna. And, lower down, the _Uhaihas_.\r\n\r\nThe Juruenna, which is said to take the name of a nation, has its\r\norigin a little to the north of the Jauru. Its course is directed\r\nto the north, and it incorporates by two mouths with the Arinos,\r\nbetween the parallel of 9° and 10°. Its large volume of water, more\r\nconsiderable than the river which receives it, shows that it is joined\r\nby numerous other streams in its course. Hitherto, it has not been\r\nnavigated by Christians; those who have examined it at the mouths\r\nstate, that its waters are particularly clear, and that various islands\r\nare situated in that portion of its bed within view. It is discharged\r\nbetween two _serrotes_, or hills, of trifling elevation. The\r\nisland separating its two mouths is of medium size and moderate\r\naltitude.\r\n\r\nThe Jamari, and the Giparanna, are the largest rivers flowing from this\r\ncomarca into the Madeira. The first rises on the northern skirts of the\r\nserra Paricis, in the territory of the Guaritere Indians, where it is\r\ncalled the Candeas, waters the lands of the Camarares, who afford their\r\nname to one of its principal arms, and discharges fifty miles below the\r\nfall of St. Antonio. It is said to have a cataract two days’ voyage\r\nabove its mouth, and to flow through auriferous lands.\r\n\r\nThe Giparanna, also called Machado, has its source to the east of the\r\nJamari, also in the skirt of a branch of the same serra, and soon\r\nbegins to be enlarged by small streams, that irrigate the territories\r\nof savage tribes, and falls into the Madeira, nearly thirty miles below\r\nthe preceding. In its vicinity there is sarsaparilla, and the cocoa\r\ntree, from which chocolate is made. Eight miles below the mouth of\r\nthe Jamari is an outlet of the lake Tucunare, little removed from the\r\nmargin of the Madeira. The river Soteiro and the Pacanova descend from\r\nthe southern side of the said serra Paricis, and fall into the Guapore,\r\nthe Soteiro forty miles below the Ubahi, and the Pacanova seventy miles\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nAlong the banks of the Madeira and the Itenez, the only parts of this\r\ncomarca that are well known, abundance of all kinds of game are met\r\nwith. Amongst other notable trees that are seen in the large woods here\r\nadjacent to those rivers, is a species of palm, called _ubussu_,\r\nthe flower of which supplies an elastic fibrous peel, so interwoven,\r\nthat it appears like the production of the loom, and serves as a cap\r\nto the Indian. The _curagiru_ affords a fine scarlet dye. The\r\ncedar is common and very thick, but, like a great many other trees of\r\nexcellent timber, of no use, from the almost total want of population\r\ncapable of appreciating their value.\r\n\r\nIn this comarca is situated the fort of Principe da Beira, erected in\r\nthe year 1776, upon the right margin of the Guapore, one league below\r\nthe mouth of the Tunama, in 12° 20′ south latitude, and one mile above\r\nthe situation where the first governor of the province established the\r\nfort of Conceiçao. The land upon which it stands is never inundated by\r\nthe river, which rises here at the period of the floods near thirty\r\nfeet, and covers with lakes a great portion of the frontier lands, thus\r\nsubjecting the garrison to fevers. Three hundred and fifty miles is\r\ncomputed from this fort to the capital; and by the river, upwards of\r\nsix hundred, so considerable are its windings.\r\n\r\nNear this fort there is a populous aldeia of Christian Indians; and at\r\na short distance higher up another, called Leonil, similarly inhabited.\r\nThe whole cultivate a diversity of the necessaries of life. They also\r\nhunt and fish.\r\n\r\nFive miles below the confluence of the Guapore with the Mamore, upon\r\nthe margin of the river Madeira, near the fall of Ribeiram, is the new\r\nparish of St. Joze. The inhabitants are composed of various nations,\r\nwith some whites, and are abundantly supplied with fish, game, and the\r\nnecessaries of life peculiar to the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _District of_ ARINOS.\r\n\r\nThis comarca, which receives its name from the river that waters it\r\nand divides it into two unequal portions, is confined on the north by\r\nTapajonia, on the west by Juruenna, on the south by Cuiaba, and on\r\nthe east by Tappiraquia. Its length is equal to that of the preceding\r\ndistrict, and its width, from east to west, is nearly three hundred\r\nmiles. A portion of the most southern part of it is commonly called\r\nVarges, or Vargeria, where, many years ago, a colony of adventurers\r\nsettled, but soon afterwards abandoned it, in consequence of the\r\nannoyance they experienced from the Indians, and the want of success\r\nattending their partial operations in mining.\r\n\r\nIt is a district very little known, although ascertained to be\r\nauriferous. Those who have navigated by the Arinos and Tapajos,\r\nstate, that it is washed by numerous rivers, almost the whole of which\r\ncontribute their waters to the enlargement of the two preceding. Its\r\naspect is varied by mountains, and, as far as the eye of the explorer\r\nhas extended, contains luxuriant and noble woods.\r\n\r\nAmongst the nations under whose dominion it hitherto has remained,\r\nthe _Baccuris_ are well known, who possess the first territory\r\nirrigated by the Arinos; also the _Manbares_, who are wanderers\r\nin the land traversed by the river Taburuhina, the first remarkable\r\nconfluent of the Juruenna on the eastern bank. The _Appiacas_\r\noccupy the centre of the comarca, and have an aldeia with high houses\r\nupon the right border of the river Arinos. They are a ferocious people,\r\nlive by hunting and fishing, and with axes of stone they prepare the\r\ntimber for the construction of their houses and their canoes. Northward\r\nof the last dwell the _Cabahibas_, who speak the same idiom. It\r\nis to be hoped that these tribes, when they begin to experience the\r\nadvantage of iron instruments and clothing, which they can derive alone\r\nfrom the navigators of this river, will become more civilized, and\r\ncontribute to the cultivation of those neglected districts.\r\n\r\nThe river Arinos, which took the name of a nation at present unknown,\r\nrises near the origins of the Paraguay, and falls into the sublime\r\nAmazon under the name of the Tapajos. In 1805, Joam Vieges accomplished\r\non this river almost the same voyage as its first discoverer, Captain\r\nJoam de Souza e Azevedo; and in 1812, Antonio Thomé de Franca also\r\ndescended by it, and in the following year proceeded up with his fleet\r\nof canoes, laden in the city of Para, being the first individual who\r\nperformed this voyage, unquestionably less laborious and much shorter\r\nthan that by the river Madeira.\r\n\r\nThe first considerable river united with the Arinos by the right border\r\nis the Rio Preto, which rises between the Paraguay and the Cuiaba, and,\r\nby the left, the Sumidor, which originates a little to the north of\r\nthe Sipotuba. This name is given to it in consequence of disappearing,\r\n(after a course of many leagues,) beneath a rock, from whence it issues\r\nat no great distance below. A canoe confided to the current at the\r\nupper side soon appears at the other. Captain Joam de Souza descended\r\nby the Sumidor, and others by the Rio Preto embarking upon it at a\r\nsituation about ten miles distant from the arraial of Diamantino.\r\n\r\nIt appears singular that none of these navigators descended by the\r\nArinos from its upper part, which, when it receives the Rio Petro, is\r\nlarger than that river. All the canoes with which those rivers have\r\nbeen navigated were constructed of the trunks of trees produced upon\r\ntheir margins, demonstrating sufficiently the substantial nature of the\r\nsoil, and its adaptation to all the purposes of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-eight hours of navigation, (performed in the course of four\r\ndays,) from the bar of Rio Preto to that of the Sumidor, Viegas met\r\nwith nineteen rivers, yet nameless, and almost the whole entered the\r\nArinos by the right. The largest is a few leagues above the mouth of\r\nthe Sumidor, which latter is little inferior to the Arinos.\r\n\r\nAfter an extensive course, the Arinos loses the name, upon\r\nincorporating with the Juruenna, the united waters forming the Tapajos,\r\nproperly Tapayo, from a nation of this name, who inhabited its margins\r\nfurther to the northward. The first considerable river united with\r\nit by the right is the Azevedo, so denominated after its discoverer.\r\nAt a great distance lower down is the embouchure of another river\r\non the right, thirty fathoms in width. A little further two morros\r\napproximate, and contract its bed, and an elevated island divides it\r\ninto two channels, through which its waters flow with equal rapidity.\r\n\r\nFrom hence about three hours’ voyage is a cascade of considerable\r\naltitude, the murmuring noise and evaporation arising from which\r\nannounce another of the wonders of nature long before it becomes\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nBeyond this interesting object is discovered the mouth of another\r\nriver, apparently at least equal to the Tapajos, which is here very\r\nwide; but is however almost immediately reduced by two lateral morros\r\nto a little more than one hundred fathoms of width, and after a short\r\nspace again presents a more than ordinary expansion, and receives also\r\nby the right margin another river of thirty fathoms in width. It is\r\nabout three hours’ navigation from the mouth of one river to the other.\r\n\r\nUpon the margin of the Rio Preto, at the place where the canoes\r\ncommence their voyage, a povoaçoe is now establishing for the\r\naccommodation of the navigators of the Tapajos.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _District of_ TAPPIRAQUIA.\r\n\r\nThis comarca derives its name from one of its tribes of Indians,\r\nand is limited on the north by Xingutania, on the west by the river\r\nXingu, which separates it from the preceding district, on the south by\r\nBororonia, and on the east by the river Araguaya, which divides it from\r\nNova Beira. It comprises the same length as the Arinos from north to\r\nsouth, and upwards of two hundred miles from east to west.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the eastern boundary, along the Araguaya, it is\r\nunknown, for want of the relations of those who penetrated into it at\r\nan earlier period. Amongst other nations who have this district under\r\ntheir dominion, are the _Guapindaias_; the _Tappiraques_, who\r\nafford it the name; the _Ximbiuas_, and the _Aracis_.\r\n\r\nThe southern part contains various rivers. The most remarkable are the\r\nBoys, Barahu, Irahiras, and Xanacy, all arms of the great river Xingu,\r\nbut it is not known which is its principal head.\r\n\r\nThose that originate more to the east form the river St. Joao, which\r\nenters the Araguaya above fifty miles north of the river Mortes. To the\r\nsouth of its embouchure there is a large lake which communicates with\r\nit, as well as with the river that receives it, during the periodical\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nSeventy miles below the river St. Joao, the Vertentes falls also into\r\nthe Araguaya, after an extensive course. A little to the north of the\r\nre-union of the two arms of the Araguaya, which form the large island\r\nof St. Anna, is the mouth of the river Ponta, not very considerable;\r\nand a short distance lower down that of the Tappiraques, so called from\r\nits originating in the territory of the Indians of the same name.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the river Tappiraques, upon the margin of the\r\nAraguaya, in the space of eighty miles, were founded the three aldeias\r\nof Lappa, Almeida, and Semancelhe, for the habitation of various\r\nfamilies of the Ximbiua tribe, reduced to peace in the year 1775, who\r\nsoon afterwards adopted their former rude mode of living. They are\r\na people passionately fond of hunting and fishing, the produce of\r\nwhich constitute their principal subsistence. The first certanistas\r\nwho penetrated into these districts, killing some partridges, found\r\nin their crops granites with gold, a proof of the existence of that\r\nprecious metal here, and which may stimulate future exertions in the\r\ndesirable object of introducing cultivation and Christianity into\r\nextensive territories yet uncolonized.\r\n\r\nThe great fertility of these lands, and the facility with which their\r\nproductions might be transported by their noble rivers, particularly\r\ntowards Gram Para, also concur in raising the expectation that some\r\neffectual measures will be adopted to civilize the savage wanderers,\r\nand convert the widely extending woods to the purposes of such culture\r\nas the soil, now overshadowed with constant gloom, may be found to be\r\nbest adapted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n                          PROVINCE OF GOYAZ.\r\n\r\n   _First Discovery of Gold--Attempts of Bueno to find the Goya\r\n   Territory--Settlements--Boundaries--Extent--Mineralogy--\r\n   Zoology--Phytology--Cattle and Gold its Exports--Principal\r\n   Rivers--Comarcas--Julgados.--District of Cayaponia--Limits\r\n   --Indians--Rivers.--District of Goyaz--Limits--Mountains--\r\n   Capital--Povoaçōes.--District of Nova Beira--Limits--Indians\r\n   --Rivers--Povoaçōes--Indians reduced to Peace--Aldeias\r\n   established for them.--District of Tucantines--Limits--Rivers\r\n   --Indians--Povoaçōes.--District of Parannan--Limits--Rivers\r\n   --Povoaçōes.--District of Rio das Velhas--Limits--Rivers--\r\n   Indians--Povoaçōes._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis province had its origin in the year 1749, being until that time a\r\ncomarca or ouvidoria of St. Paulo, so created in 1737, and colonized by\r\nadventuring miners.\r\n\r\nThe first intelligence of this territory possessing gold was given by\r\nManuel Correa, a native of the town of St. Paulo de Piratininga, who\r\nfound ten oitavas of this metal, which he gave as a diadem to crown the\r\nsacred image of the Lady of Penha, at the town of Sorocaba. Though the\r\ndate of this circumstance is not known, it appears, by a journal found\r\nat Correa’s death, that he collected the said gold with a pewter plate\r\nin the river Aracis.\r\n\r\nBartholomew Bueno, who succeeded Correa in the same undertaking about\r\nthe year 1670, was accompanied by his son of the same name, then only\r\ntwelve years old. They dwelt some time in the vicinity of the situation\r\nwhere the capital of this province now stands, and observed that the\r\nwomen of the Goya tribe, masters of the district, ornamented themselves\r\nwith gold.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the mines of Cuiaba, in 1719, directed the attention\r\nof B. Bueno, the son, (the father being then dead,) to the territory of\r\nthe Goyaz; and imparting his knowledge of the gold discovered by his\r\nfather in the possession of this tribe, to Rodrigo Cezar de Menezes,\r\nthat governor despatched him, with a numerous party, and one hundred\r\nmuskets, in the year 1722, in order that he might go in search of and\r\nestablish himself in the country.\r\n\r\nBueno, having lost all recollection of such signals as might have\r\npointed out the way to the Goya district, proceeded too far to the\r\nsouth, and having arrived at the banks of a river, they remained there\r\nfor some days, and gave it the name of Rio dos Piloes: they found\r\nthere a considerable quantity of gold, which produced some dissension\r\namongst the party, many wishing to remain in order to take advantage\r\nof it. Bueno, however, was determined upon the accomplishment of his\r\nobject; and thinking that the rich treasure he was in pursuit of lay\r\nstill further to the west, he proceeded in that direction for some\r\ndays, when they reached a river, which they denominated the river of\r\nPerdition, in consequence of then considering themselves entirely out\r\nof the route to Goyaz. Continuing without embarrassment the same march,\r\nthey encountered a larger river, and beyond this a third, which they\r\ncalled the Rio das Areas, in consequence of the sandy nature of its\r\nbed. Journeying onwards to the west, they found another, which received\r\nthe appellation of Rio Rico, (Rich River,) from the gold which they\r\ndiscovered in it.\r\n\r\nHaving lost all hopes of finding the wished-for district in this\r\ndirection, Bueno retraced his steps, and deviating in the way, after\r\na prolonged and tedious journey, arrived at the river Parannan, where\r\nhe considered himself still further from his object, in consequence\r\nof perceiving certain signs of cattle, which he afterwards found had\r\nstrayed from the margins of the river St. Francisco in search of better\r\npasturage.\r\n\r\nAfter three years of ineffectual perseverance and disappointed labour,\r\nin quest of the enchanting land, this certanista arrived at St. Paulo\r\nwith a part of his bandeira; the remainder having died from diseases\r\nand disasters inseparable from such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe tender age of Bueno when he accompanied his father to the district\r\nin question, and fifty years of interval, exculpated him from all blame\r\nin the unfortunate result of this enterprise; and, as he was a man\r\nof known probity, the same governor despatched him again, with every\r\nnecessary succour, in the confident expectation of a more successful\r\nissue. Bueno proceeded for three months through unknown districts,\r\nwithout any track or road, encountering various torrents, and other\r\nobstacles of a worse nature, replete with difficulties and delay: at\r\nlast he arrived at a place about eight miles distant from the present\r\nsituation of the capital, where he perceived some indications of\r\nPortuguese having been there at some former period, which induced him\r\nto halt upon the spot with his companions. Two old Indians were caught,\r\nwho proved to be of the Goya nation; and on being interrogated if they\r\nknew the place where some white men had been established many years\r\nago; they replied, that it was not far distant. The caravan now moved\r\nforward again, accompanied by the two Indians, who led the way to a\r\nsituation, at the present time occupied by the arraial of Ferreiro,\r\nand which Bueno immediately recognised to be the much desired spot\r\nwhere he had been with his father. He immediately proceeded to make the\r\nrequisite arrangements for forming an establishment, and to carry into\r\nexecution the objects of this enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe fortunate Bueno now returned to his country, with the intelligence\r\nof having discovered the long sought-for district, which was traversed\r\nby five streams, all having abundance of gold; a pretty considerable\r\nportion of which he presented at the same time, in confirmation of\r\nthose glad tidings. He soon received the commission of Captain Mor\r\nRegente, and proceeded to rejoin his colony in the year 1726.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the new arraial, his first care was to adopt the\r\nbest mode of living in harmony with the Goyaz, the only tribe in the\r\ndistrict, and from whom the name of this province was derived. The\r\nIndians were, however, suspicious of their new visitors, and posted\r\nthemselves with their arms in the situation where the arraial of Barra\r\nis now seen; but Bueno adopting the artifice of seizing some women, the\r\nGoyaz desisted, at the same time offering to point out those places\r\nwhich afforded the largest quantity of gold, and which were at and\r\nnear the situation now called Ponte do Meio, and where a piece was\r\nsoon found, which, when purified, produced half a pound of gold. The\r\nwhole colony laboured in contentment, and without envying the miners of\r\nCuiaba.\r\n\r\nThe fortunate circumstances of their situation soon becoming known, and\r\nthe dangers to which persons were exposed who directed their course to\r\nCuiaba, attracted so great a number of miners to Goyaz in the course of\r\ntwo years, that the necessaries which daily arrived with the numerous\r\ncaravans and troops from St. Paulo, (to which city alone there was any\r\ntrack or road,) were inadequate to their subsistence. Every thing sold\r\nat an exorbitant price; of gold there was enough, but it could not\r\nsupply sustenance. An alqueire of Indian corn cost six or seven oitavas\r\nof gold; and the same measure of the flour of mandioca ten oitavas.\r\nA milch cow, which appeared there, was bought for two pounds weight\r\nof the same metal, and a hog for twenty-eight. Two oitavas of gold\r\nwere demanded for a pound of sugar; and every article of subsistence\r\nwas procured only by payment in the same proportion. The dealers who\r\nconveyed the necessaries of life by a tedious journey were enriched;\r\nbut the mines were still more lucrative at this period. Many were at\r\nlength induced to devote a portion of their time to the cultivation of\r\nthe necessaries of life, that the gold which they collected might not\r\nbe consumed in payment for them.\r\n\r\nThis province, in the centre of Brazil, and ranking amongst the\r\nlargest in the state, is confined on the north by the provinces of\r\nPara and Maranham; on the west by Cuiaba, from which it is separated\r\nby the river Araguaya; on the south by Camapuania and the province\r\nof St. Paulo; and on the east by the provinces of Minas Geraes, and\r\nPernambuco, which are divided from it by a cordillera, stretching north\r\nand south, stony and barren, and which alone affords passage at the\r\nlargest openings, denominated _boqueiroes_; each portion taking\r\nits particular name, and the northern being the most elevated. The\r\nlength of this province is about seven hundred miles, computing from\r\nthe confluence of the Araguaya with the Tucantines to that of the Pardo\r\nwith the Parannan, and its width proportionable. It lies between 6°\r\nand 18° of south latitude; the rains only prevail during the thunder\r\npeculiar to these climates, which commences in October and terminates\r\nin April.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of this province is almost universally uneven, although in\r\nfew parts mountainous, having many portions called _catingas_, not\r\nfavourable to cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe soil is only fertile where there are woods, with which it does not\r\nabound, if we except the districts of the capital, Meia Ponte, Pilar,\r\nand St. Luzia, by the margins of the Corumba. Admiration is excited by\r\nthe wood called Matto Grosso, (Large Wood,) upwards of thirty miles in\r\nwidth, upon the road of Meia Ponte to the capital, about the centre of\r\nthat interval, and its length extending from the river Almas to the\r\ncentre of Cayaponia.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Gold, diamonds, crystals, granite, calcareous stone,\r\nminerals of iron, mineral salt, a diversity of argils, &c. The largest\r\nfifth on gold here was of one hundred and sixty-nine thousand and\r\neighty oitavas, in 1753, and the smallest of eleven thousand eight\r\nhundred and ninety-three, in 1807. This diminution arises from not\r\nworking into the mountains, which, no doubt, abound with this metal.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--This province abounds in cattle. Goats are few in number,\r\nand almost of no utility. Sheep are somewhat more numerous; little\r\nadvantage is, however, derived from their wool, which might be easily\r\nrendered subservient to some branches of industry. Very few more hogs\r\nare bred than what are for the consumption of the country. Horses are\r\nalso bred; those of Parannan are esteemed the best. Deer are every\r\nwhere numerous, and their skins furnish a branch of commerce. The\r\nounce, anta, the wild hog, wolf, monkey, hare, _tamandua_, _cotia_,\r\n_quati_, _paca_, with many other species of quadrupeds, common in the\r\nadjacent provinces, are here well known and much pursued by the hunter.\r\nSome are esteemed for the flesh, some for the skin, and others for\r\nboth. Partridges and the emu ostrich are met with upon the plains.\r\nThe _mutun_ bird inhabits the wood, and by its song invites the\r\nfatal attacks of the hunter. The _tucano_, the torquaze pigeon, the\r\n_aracuan_, the _araponga_, and the _jacu_, are numerous. A great part\r\nof those creatures are devoured in a raw state by the Indians, without\r\nsalt or any kind of seasoning.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--There are a variety of medicinal plants, divers sorts of\r\npalm trees; the large _jatuba_ affords gum copal. The Brazil wood, and\r\nsimilar valuable timber, is here of no utility, in consequence of the\r\ngreat distance of any maritime town. The tobacco plant is cultivated\r\nwith great advantage where the soil is substantial. From the fruit of\r\nthe _mamona_ tree is extracted oil for lights. The cotton tree prospers\r\nin many parts, and its wool constitutes a branch of commerce, which\r\nis beginning to be advantageous to the population. The sugar cane is\r\ncultivated in many districts, and employs various engenhos; the greater\r\npart of its juice is converted into spirit, and some sugar, called\r\n_rapaduras_. The flour of mandioca, Indian corn, and legumes, are the\r\nmost abundant productions of agriculture. The fruit of the _araca_, the\r\npine-apple, the _mangaba_, the _goyaba_, the banana, _jabuticaba_, the\r\n_ambuo_, are common, and of various qualities. Oranges and water-melons\r\nare excellent. Quinces are small and insipid; but a large quantity of\r\n_doce_, or preserves, is here made of them. The vine trees grow to a\r\nremarkable size in some districts, and produce fruit abundantly twice\r\na year. Wine is made of the grapes in the dry season, which is yet\r\nvery indifferent; such as are produced in the winter season serve for\r\nvinegar, and afford a good substitute for that of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe cochineal plant is very common, but, hitherto, not appropriated\r\nto the production of that insect. Many parts are well adapted to the\r\nproduce of indigo, the culture of which receives here no attention. The\r\nproductions of those two vegetables, from their great value, are the\r\nonly ones which the agriculturist of these districts could convey to\r\nthe maritime ports with any considerable profit and security. The trees\r\nof incense, senna, and manna, are not unknown. Campeche and a species\r\nof rhubarb are also met with.\r\n\r\nGold and cattle are the only objects of exportation, which introduce\r\ninto the country what little may be found of luxury, and the\r\nnecessaries of life required from without. If a little cotton wool,\r\nor coarse cotton cloth, with some hides, are conveyed to the eastern\r\nports, it is only that the troops of animals may not proceed unladen\r\non their journeys to bring back the necessary dry goods, salt, iron,\r\n&c.; these articles would not otherwise pay one-half of the expense of\r\nconveyance. At present, the breeders of cattle and senhors d’engenhos\r\nare the only individuals who live constantly independent; the same may\r\nbe said of miners and traders, when they are favoured by fortune in\r\ntheir operations. None, however, experience want; and agriculture is\r\nproportioned to the population. The present king has been solicitous\r\nto increase both in this fine and fertile province; and, when Prince\r\nRegent, he afforded his countenance and support, in September, 1812, to\r\na plan for establishing a commercial company between this province and\r\nPara, the funds of which were not to be less than one hundred thousand\r\ncrusades. The establishment of warehouses and prezidios, in situations\r\nbest adapted to promote the navigation of the Maranham, and Tucantines,\r\nfrom Arroios to Porto Real, where almost all the obstacles terminate\r\nwhich impede the navigation upwards, cannot fail with the requisite\r\nattention and wisdom to effect this desirable project. All members who\r\nentered this society with ten thousand crusades, besides other favours,\r\nwere to obtain what is termed a _sesmaria_ of land, extending\r\nfive miles in front and five miles in depth, upon the margin of the\r\nMaranham, the Tucantines, and the Araguaya; and those who established\r\nthemselves either upon the margins or in the certams of those rivers,\r\nwere to be exempt from the payment of tenths upon their productions,\r\nand to be free from the duties of entrance upon the articles of\r\ncommerce navigated by the said rivers.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The Tucantines, the Araguaya, the Corumba, the Parannan, and\r\nthe Parannahiba, are the principal rivers, and receive all the others\r\nwhich to a considerable number water this province.\r\n\r\nThe principal head of the Tucantines is the river Urubu, which\r\noriginates in the southern skirt of the serra Doirada, a short distance\r\nsouthward from the capital, and after seventy miles of course towards\r\nthe north-east, loses the name, confounding itself with the river\r\nAlmas, which is not inferior to it; and from its origin, near the\r\nbase of the Montes Pyreneos, flows north-west, about an equal number\r\nof miles. After ninety miles of further extent to the north-east, it\r\nloses also the name, uniting itself with the Maranham, which is little\r\ninferior to it in volume and in length of course. The principal head of\r\nthe Maranham is the lake Formosa, which is fifteen miles in extent, and\r\ntwo in width. It flows to the north-west, and three miles previous to\r\nuniting with the Almas, at the passage to the arraial of Aguaquentes,\r\nis one hundred and sixty fathoms in width; a little above, it runs\r\nthrough a bed of rock so contracted that its width is only fifty feet.\r\nAt this confluence, where it becomes very considerable, it flows\r\nnorthward, describing gentle windings, and augmenting by the many\r\nstreams which unite themselves with it, especially by the eastern side.\r\n\r\nA little below the confluence of the Almas with the Maranham, when the\r\nlatter traverses a range of small hills, is the cataract of Facao,\r\nwhich prevents the progress of canoes in either direction.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and forty miles below the said confluence the large river\r\nParanatinga falls into it on the right margin, which takes this name\r\nnearly thirty miles above its embouchure, at the junction of the\r\nParannan and the Palma, the latter flowing westward, and the other,\r\nwhich is much larger, north-west from its origin in the General Serra;\r\ntraversing an unwholesome country, abounding with pasturage, where a\r\nprodigious number of cattle and mules are bred.\r\n\r\nAt the confluence of the Paranatinga, which is said to be in 12° 20′\r\nlatitude, the Maranham takes the name of Tucantines, which it preserves\r\nuntil its large volume of water is mingled with the ocean below the\r\ncity of Para. Nearly seventy miles north of the last confluence the\r\nlarge river Cannabrava discharges itself into the Tucantines by the\r\nleft margin, and a little lower by the right the considerable river\r\nManuel Alvez, which issues from the Duro Serra, a portion of the\r\ncordillera which bounds the province, bringing the waters of many small\r\nstreams that unite themselves with it on both sides in the space of one\r\nhundred and fifty miles, the extent of its course.\r\n\r\nA little further to the north, the abundant river Tabocas disembogues\r\nby the left, having its heads near the serra of Estrondo. One hundred\r\nand forty miles to the north of the said river Manuel Alvez, also by\r\nthe eastern margin, the Somno (Sleep) adds its abundant waters; and,\r\nafter a little farther distance, the other Manuel Alvez discharges\r\nitself, being larger than the first, and serves, up to the present\r\nperiod, as the northern limit of the eastern portion of the province.\r\nBoth those rivers flow from the boundary, traversing a territory\r\ninhabited by malevolent Indians. A party proceeded up the first, with\r\nthe intention of exploring its margins and extent, under the influence\r\nof such an unpropitious star that they were never more heard of;\r\nfrom which circumstance the river received the name by which it is\r\ndesignated.\r\n\r\nA few miles below the Manuel Alvez (the northern) the Tucantines\r\ndescribes a considerable winding towards the east, almost circular,\r\nagain approximating very near to the place where it had on a sudden\r\nchanged its direction, and immediately describing another contrary\r\nwinding to the west, forming two peninsulas, the first of a circular\r\nfigure, and the other in the form of an oval.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred miles further, in the latitude of six degrees,\r\nthe Araguaya incorporates itself with the Tucantines on the left,\r\nrendering it exceedingly voluminous and grand, still continuing to flow\r\nnorthward, describing fewer windings and becoming gradually larger.\r\nWhen it passes the town of Cameta, in about 3° latitude, its width is\r\nalready more than ten miles. The tide flows up this river more than\r\ntwo hundred miles, nearly to the situation denominated Itaboca, which\r\nliterally means “perforated stone,” where the river is precipitated,\r\nin a short space, over three falls, which compel the navigator to\r\nunload his canoes. One hundred miles is computed between the mouths\r\nof the Araguaya and Itaboca, and from thence to Cameta one hundred\r\nand twenty. The _paratinga_, not less than eight feet in length,\r\nwith proportionate circumference, and the _jahu_, are the largest\r\nfish of the High Tucantines, which is not considered to abound in any\r\nspecies of fish.\r\n\r\nThe Araguaya, almost as extensive as the province, forms its western\r\nboundary from its embouchure to the origin of its principal head,\r\nwhich is in the vicinity of that of the Hipiaughuhi, there flows under\r\nthe name of the Bonito, which, after gathering by the western bank\r\nthe river Barreiros and by the eastern the Caiapo, takes the name of\r\nRio Grande, by which it is designated when it traverses the road of\r\nCuiaba. The first considerable river that unites itself with it after\r\npassing this road is the Rio Claro, which comes from the south-east,\r\nand brings with it the Fartura, that originates in the proximity of the\r\nUruhu. One hundred miles to the north it receives by the same margin\r\nthe Vermelho, which is inconsiderable when it passes the capital; a few\r\nleagues lower it gathers the Tizoiras, of little less volume and extent\r\nthan the preceding; and nearly thirty miles further it is united by the\r\nCrixa, which is something larger than the others. All three flow from\r\nthe south-east, and none of them with less than two hundred miles of\r\ncourse. Navigation has been conducted, by the central one, up to this\r\nday, from the capital to the city of Para.\r\n\r\nThirty miles north of the mouth of the Crixa, which is also navigable,\r\nand has some salt pits in its vicinity, the Araguaya divides itself\r\nin the latitude of 12° 30′ into two branches nearly equal, which\r\nre-unite themselves in the parallel of 9° 36′, having formed the island\r\nof St. Anna, otherwise Bannanal, of one hundred and eighty miles in\r\nlength, and of good width: there is a vast lake in the island which\r\nhas an outlet into an arm of this river. The western arm preserves\r\nthe name of Araguaya, and the eastern takes that of Furo, by which\r\nlatter navigators commonly proceed. Both have falls, and a great number\r\nof islands, generally small, flat, and for the most part inundated\r\nduring the periodical rains. The margins of the Furo are lower than\r\nthose of the other arm, which latter receives by the western side\r\nvarious rivers, with which it is greatly augmented. The principal is\r\nthe Mortes, which flows from the centre of Bororonia with near three\r\nhundred miles of course, and empties itself about forty miles north of\r\nthe southern point of the island of St. Anna. At the northern extremity\r\nof this island the margins of the Araguaya are elevated a little to\r\nthe confluence of that river with the Tucantines. The first navigators\r\nplaced this confluence in 6°, the geographers of Para in 5°, and others\r\nin 3° 30′; the medium is evidently nearest the truth.\r\n\r\nThe river Corumba has its origin in the proximity of that of the river\r\nAlmas, not far distant from the Montes Pyreneos. Its course for a vast\r\nspace describes a large semicircle to the east (where it receives,\r\namongst others, the river St. Bartholomew) as far as the parallel of\r\nits source, where the river Peixe is incorporated with it by the right.\r\nThirty miles lower the river Verissimo unites itself with it on the\r\nleft, after an extensive course, bringing the waters of another called\r\nBraco do Verissimo. From hence it flows for a considerable extent, and\r\nloses its name on falling into the Parannahiba, which constitutes a\r\nboundary for some miles to the province of Minas Geraes as far as the\r\nmouth of the river St. Marcos, its northern head, and which makes a\r\nsimilar divisionary line in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nBelow the embouchure of the Corumba, the Parannahiba is joined by the\r\nlarge river Velhas, the principal head of which is near that of the\r\nAndayha, on the borders of Minas Geraes. Many leagues below the mouth\r\nof the river Velhas is the confluence of the Parannahiba with the Rio\r\nGrande, the limit of the province. In the vicinity of the embouchure\r\nof the Velhas, the Parannahiba receives on the right the Annicuns, the\r\nmost considerable amongst those which unite themselves with it on that\r\nside, and has its source in the large wood of Matto Grosso previously\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the povoaçoes or inhabited places of this province already\r\nexisted when it was so created and delivered to the government of\r\nthe viceroy, Conde d’Arcos; and all of them, excepting those in the\r\nsouthern districts, owe their foundation to the gold sought after upon\r\ntheir sites and surrounding lands.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the ouvidor extended over the whole province, until\r\nthe present King, when Prince Regent, by a decree of the 18th of\r\nMarch, 1809, divided it into two comarcas, the new one taking the name\r\nof St. Joam das Duas Barras, the other retaining that of the capital.\r\nEach of them comprehends eight _julgados_, or divisions, including\r\nthe district of the capital, the only povoaçao yet enjoying the title\r\nof a town.\r\n\r\nThe comarca of Villaboa comprises the following julgados:--\r\n\r\n    Villaboa\r\n    Crixa\r\n    Pilar\r\n    Meia Ponte\r\n    St. Luzia\r\n    St. Cruz\r\n    Desemboque\r\n    Araxa.\r\n\r\nThe comarca of St. Joam das Duas Barras the following:--\r\n\r\n    Porto Real\r\n    Natividade\r\n    Conceiçao\r\n    Arrayas\r\n    St. Feliz\r\n    Cavalcante\r\n    Flores\r\n    Trahyras.\r\n\r\nThe above division of the province points out the jurisdiction of each\r\ncomarca, but does not assist to form a correct idea of the country, in\r\nconsequence of the great inequality which prevails in their extent and\r\npopulation; for instance, the julgado of the capital is upwards of five\r\nhundred miles long from north to south, and of proportionable width,\r\nand the julgado of Conceiçao extends east and west from one boundary of\r\nthe province to the other; whilst that of Pilar is not more than one\r\nhundred miles long, and those of Desemboque and Araxa are much smaller.\r\n\r\nIt will be therefore preferable, in the delineation of this province,\r\nto follow nature, which has divided it into six cantos, not varying\r\nessentially in extent, and marked by visible boundaries. A line drawn\r\nfrom the mouth of the Parannahiba by its bed to the confluence of the\r\nriver Annicuns, by this upwards, then by the river Boys to its origin,\r\ncrossing to that of the river Pedras, by it down to the Almas, which\r\ncontinues it to the Maranham and Tucantines, divides the province into\r\ntwo parts, eastern and western, which latter is the larger portion,\r\neach of which is subdivided into three grand districts; namely,--\r\n\r\n    Cayaponia  }\r\n    Goyaz      } in the western portion.\r\n    Nova Beira }\r\n\r\n    Tucantines     }\r\n    Parannan       } in the eastern.\r\n    Rio das Velhas }\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _District of_ CAYAPONIA.\r\n\r\nCayaponia derives its name from the _Cayapo_ nation, who have\r\noccupied it from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nIt is bounded on the north by the district of Goyaz; on the west by\r\nBororonia, from which it is separated by the river Araguaya; on the\r\nsouth by Camapuania, from which it is divided by the river Pardo; and\r\non the east by the rivers Paranna, Parannahiba, and Annicuns, which\r\nseparate it, the first from the province of St. Paulo, the others from\r\nthe district of Rio das Velhas. The northern limit is distinctly marked\r\nby a range of mountains, running in the same parallel of latitude as\r\nthe lake of Pasmados, situated near the river of its name, in 17° 20′.\r\nIt is upwards of two hundred and fifty miles in length from north to\r\nsouth, and one hundred and seventy at its medium width.\r\n\r\nIt is the least known amongst the districts of this province, not yet\r\npossessing a single Christianized establishment. The Cayapos, divided\r\ninto various tribes, under whose dominion it hitherto remains, have\r\nfrom time to time made destructive sallies upon the caravans of Cuiaba,\r\nand invaded the northern part of the province of St. Paulo, where they\r\nhave occasioned the flight of many colonies. They wander about almost\r\nin a state of nudity. Besides the bow and arrow, arms common to all the\r\nother Indian nations, they use also a club about one yard in length, of\r\nchoice wood, round at the end which they lay hold of, and flat in the\r\nform of an oar at the other, the whole ornamented or dressed with the\r\nbarks of shrubs of various colours, and woven in imitation of a mat.\r\nA blow from this weapon is fatal. Honey, fish, wild fruits, and game\r\nare their aliment. Their principal dwelling places are in the vicinity\r\nof the river Cururuhy, and not far removed from the cataract of Urubu\r\nPunga, whither they are in the habit of proceeding in large parties,\r\nfor the purpose of fishing. There are times that the Portuguese do\r\nnot experience any hostility from these Indians, and amongst other\r\ninstances, one occurred in the year 1810, when Dr. Joam Ferreyra,\r\ntreasurer-mor of the cathedral of St. Paulo, in order to gratify his\r\ncuriosity, proceeded to visit and examine this famous cataract, where\r\nhe arrived at the same time that a tribe of Cayapos appeared there, who\r\nconducted themselves as ancient allies, and with every appearance of\r\nfriendship; they received graciously the presents which the traveller\r\nliberally offered to them, and allowed various persons of both sexes\r\nand different ages to remain in his company.\r\n\r\nThe ancient certanistas met with various rivers in the interior of\r\nthis district, flowing southward, and their diaries enumerate, amongst\r\nothers, the Perdiçao, which is nearest to the Annicuns, and most\r\nprobably one of its tributaries; the Turvo, the Doirados, the Gallera,\r\nand the Pasmados, which is the most westerly, receives some of the\r\npreceding, and falls into the Parannan, near the cascade of Urubu\r\nPunga, under the name of Cururuhy. They also mention the Appary, which\r\ndischarges itself into the said Parannan, many leagues above the fall,\r\nand two Cayapos, both tributaries like the preceding river, and little\r\ndistant, one to the south and the other to the north of it.\r\n\r\nThe Sucuriu is considerable, disembogues a little below the Tiete, and\r\nis navigable nearly to its origin, which is north of Camapuan, upon the\r\nborder of Bororonia. A certanista proceeded by it with his canoes to\r\nthe Piquery, which conducted them to the river St. Lourenço.\r\n\r\nThe river Verde, which is also considerable, and of crystalline and\r\nexcellent water, affords navigation to the interior of a peninsula,\r\nformed by the preceding river and the Pardo, the southern limit of\r\nthe province, with the Parannan, which receives them. The water of\r\nthis river, before being drawn from its bed, resembles green ink. Its\r\nmargins abound with most beautiful woods, consisting of the finest\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _District of_ GOYAZ.\r\n\r\nThis district, which is larger than the preceding one, and is bounded\r\nby it on the south, has on the west the same limits as the province; on\r\nthe east the districts of Rio das Velhas and Parannan; and on the north\r\nthe district of Nova Beira, from which it is separated in part by the\r\nEstrondo serra and the river Tabocas.\r\n\r\nThe nation from which the province borrowed its name was not the only\r\none that ruled here; to the north of it there lived a tribe called\r\n_Crixas_, whose name was given to the river that traverses their\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nAmongst other mountains, generally of moderate elevation, may be\r\nenumerated the serra Doirada, not far distant from the capital, to the\r\nsouthward, which extends itself for a considerable space to the west.\r\nThe serra Escalvada, lying further to the south, and running in the\r\nsame direction as the preceding one; the serra Santa Martha, to the\r\nsouth-west of the last; and the Sentinilla, which prolongs itself for a\r\ngreat distance with the river Claro.\r\n\r\nThe said river Claro, the Vermelho, the Tizoiras, and the Crixa, are\r\nthe principal streams of this district. The second is small on passing\r\nthe capital, but soon afterwards becomes more considerable by the\r\naddition of various small rivers, which render it navigable. Amongst\r\nthose which join it by the left margin are the Indios, the Tacoaral,\r\nthe Tigres, and the Cachoeira, all issuing from the Doirada serra. The\r\nBugres is the first abundant stream which unites itself with it by the\r\nright bank, and the Ferreiro the second. The Peixe is an arm of the\r\nTizoiras, and navigable.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the district is to be noted the river Caldas,\r\nwhich is of short extent; it issues from a lake of the same name, and\r\ndischarges itself into the Maranham, fifty miles above the Paratininga.\r\n\r\nThe Santa Thereza, and the Cannabrava, enter the Tucantines by one\r\ncommon embouchure, under the name of the first, which is the most\r\nvoluminous.\r\n\r\nThe principal povoaçoes are, Villa Boa, Crixa, and Pilar.\r\n\r\nVilla Boa, at its commencement denominated the arraial of St. Anna,\r\nwas raised into a town in the year 1739, and is large, populous, and\r\nflourishing. It is the residence of the governor, at present Senhor\r\nFernando Delgado, of the prelate, who is a bishop _in partibus_,\r\nand also of the ouvidor of the comarca, who fills other situations as\r\nwell as that of crown judge. The senate is presided by a Juiz de Fora,\r\nwho besides holds the appointment of attorney-general.\r\n\r\nThis town occupies a flat situation upon the margins of the Vermelho,\r\nwhich divides it into two unequal portions, communicating by three\r\nbridges. It is in the centre of the Brazil. Its edifices are neither\r\nlarge, elegant, nor substantial: the principal are the mother church,\r\ndedicated to St. Anna, five chapels to the Lady of Boa Morte, Rozario,\r\nCarmo, Abbadia, and Lapa; another of St. Francisco; the palace of the\r\ngovernor; the Caza da Camara, (or town house); the Caza da Contadoria,\r\n(exchequer); and the Caza da Fundicao do Oiro, (smelting house.) It\r\nhas a fort, with two pieces of artillery to fire salutations upon\r\noccasions of solemnities, a fountain, and a public walk. The heat is\r\nintense during the dry season; night breezes, however, are usual, and\r\nexceedingly grateful.\r\n\r\nThis town has a tribunal which decides upon the affairs of the\r\nprovince, denominated the Junta de Real Fazenda, a council consisting\r\nof five deputies, including the governor, who is the president, the\r\njudge, the attorney-general, a treasurer, and an escrivao. It is\r\nsituated in 16° 20′ of southern latitude.\r\n\r\nThe municipal body of this town, whose revenue amounts to one thousand\r\noitavas of gold, are said to have a _sesmaria_ of land, in a\r\ncircle around the town of five leagues in diameter.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile distant from the town, there is a hermitage of St. Barbara.\r\nFive leagues to the north-west of it is situated the small arraial of\r\nBarra, with a hermitage of the Lady of Rozario, at the embouchure of\r\nthe Bugres. Its territory is auriferous.\r\n\r\nEight leagues in the same direction as the preceding is the arraial\r\nof Anta and parish of Bom Jesus, with two chapels of the Lady of\r\nRozario and Boa Morte, situated between two small streams, which unite\r\nthemselves previously to entering the Vermelho, and was founded in\r\nthe year 1729. The gold which caused its origin is not yet exhausted;\r\nbut, whether from indolence or any other cause, no one is at present\r\noccupied in its extraction.\r\n\r\nTen miles to the north of the latter place, near the river Peixe, in a\r\nplain, is the arraial of St. Rita, ornamented with a hermitage of the\r\nsame name. It is actually the port of navigation from the capital to\r\nthe city of Para. The river discharges itself into the Tizoiras by the\r\nleft margin, and is only navigable during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles to the north of the arraial of St. Rita, near the\r\nriver Tizoiras, was founded, in the year 1755, the arraial of the\r\nsame name, which was the parish of St. Miguel, and flourished whilst\r\ncultivation was profitable; but with the apparent exhaustion of gold\r\nit began to decay, and from the sterility of the land, and the want of\r\nwater, it was ultimately forsaken. Cattle are, however, now bred in\r\nits district. A species of bird, which the discoverers of the country\r\ncalled _tizoiras_, (or scissors,) in consequence of having a tail\r\nsimilar to a pair of opened scissors, was the origin of its name.\r\n\r\nNinety miles to the north of the capital is the considerable arraial\r\nand parish of Crixa, the head of the julgado of that name, which was\r\nfounded in the year 1734, near a small river, and about ten miles\r\ndistant from the left margin of the river that affords it the name.\r\nIts church has for a titular saint the Lady of Conceiçao. There is\r\nalso a chapel of St. Efigenia, two of Nossa Senhora of Rozario and\r\nAbbadia. The population forms four companies of militia, one of which\r\nis cavalry, and another free blacks.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles to the east-north-east of Crixa, near a small river\r\nwhich runs into the Almas, is the large, flourishing, and well situated\r\narraial and parish of Pilar, head of the julgado, founded in 1741, with\r\nthe name of Pappuan, a herb abundant in this part. It is ornamented by\r\na church, whose titular saint affords its name to the establishment,\r\na chapel of St. Gonçalo, two of the Lady of Rozario and Merces, a\r\nfountain, and good streets. The environs are mountainous. In front\r\nof it there is a morro, which, it is calculated, has afforded more\r\nthan one hundred arrobas (thirty-two pounds each) of gold, and from\r\nwhence a much greater quantity might be extracted with water and proper\r\nmanagement. There is a curious operation of nature in its vicinity,\r\nnear the road of Carretao, representing human visages. It is worthy of\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles to the east of Pilar is situated the aldeia of Lavrinhas,\r\nnear the source of a small stream, which, after a course of ten miles,\r\nenters the river Almas.\r\n\r\nTen miles to the south-west of Pilar, near the river Moquem, a branch\r\nof the Crixa, is the arraial of Gorinos, with a hermitage. It was fully\r\ninhabited whilst its mines of gold were productive.\r\n\r\nThree miles to the east of Villa Boa is situated the arraial of\r\nFerreiro, (Blacksmith) with a chapel of St. Joam Baptista. It is the\r\nmost ancient establishment of the province. It derived its name from a\r\nblacksmith, who remained there exercising his trade, after the miners\r\nhad deserted it, for the purpose of mining in other places. About eight\r\nmiles to the east of the preceding place, near a small river, a branch\r\nof the river Uruhu, is the considerable arraial of Oiro Fino, (Fine\r\nGold) which took this name from the superior quality of that metal\r\nfound here. It has a chapel dedicated to the Lady of Pilar.\r\n\r\nEighteen miles to the south-west of the capital is the arraial and\r\nparish of St. Joze de Mossamedes, founded in the year 1774, for the\r\nhabitation of a numerous colony of Indians, consisting of three\r\ndifferent nations, the _Carajas_ and _Javahes_, brought from\r\nthe district of Nova Beira, and the _Accroas_, who lived to the\r\neast of the serra Parannan, in the territory where the Correntes has\r\nits heads.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight miles to the south-west of St. Joze, and forty-five from\r\nthe capital, is situated Aldeia Maria, near the margin of the river\r\nFartura, in a plain constantly refreshed by breezes. It was founded in\r\n1781, for the establishment of almost three hundred Cayapo Indians, who\r\nwere augmented in the following year by more than two hundred of the\r\nsame nation, invited thither by the report of the good treatment which\r\ntheir comrades experienced. Afterwards came various _mallocas_,\r\nor parties, amongst whom arrived some _caciques_, or captains,\r\none of whom had hair resembling that of a mulatto. One cripple and\r\nsome blind, amongst so many, prove that this nation are not greatly\r\nsubjected to natural bodily defects. At the beginning they showed\r\nthemselves grateful for the benefits conferred upon them, faithful to\r\ntheir promises, and without any remarkable propensity to thieving:\r\nsome learned trades the most wanted in the colony. The women, after a\r\nshort time, learned to spin, weave, and sew. This establishment, which\r\nwas expected to have become flourishing by this time, is considerably\r\nfallen off, in consequence, it is said, of the repugnancy of the whites\r\nto ally themselves with the Indians.\r\n\r\nWithin this district is the new arraial of Annicuns, situated near the\r\nright margin of the Boys, which here has only the appearance of a small\r\nstream. It is forty miles to the south-east of the capital, and has a\r\nchurch dedicated to St. Francisco d’Assis. Its inhabitants are miners\r\nand agriculturists. The first have formed a company for mining. The\r\nland is appropriated to various productions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _District of_ NOVA BEIRA.\r\n\r\nThe district of Nova Beira is to the north of that of Goyaz, and\r\nextends northward, between the rivers Araguaya and Tucantines, to its\r\ntermination at the angle of their confluence. It is upwards of four\r\nhundred miles in length from north to south, and one hundred and thirty\r\nin width. The island of St. Anna belongs to it.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole yet belongs to various savage nations. The _Chavante_\r\ntribe, which appears to be the most numerous, possesses the major\r\npart towards the north. Their neighbours are the _Pochetis_, the\r\n_Noroguages_, the _Appynages_, the _Carajas_, the _Cortys_, and the\r\n_Xerentes_. The Chavante Indians after being established, and many\r\nbaptized, in the aldeia of Pedro Terceiro, (in the situation of\r\nCarretao, district of Pilar,) built expressly for them, in consequence\r\nof the vassalage which they voluntarily offered, deserted all at one\r\ntime, and returned to their natural mode of life. They are at present\r\nthe most formidable enemies of the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThe river Crixa, (the northern,) the St. Antonio, and the Taboca,\r\nare the most considerable amongst those which enter the Tucantines.\r\nThe large river Chavante, formed by many others which irrigate the\r\nterritory of the tribe from whom it takes the name, flows into the\r\nAraguaya a little above the re-union of its two arms which form the\r\nisland of St. Anna.\r\n\r\nThe povoaçoes are Pontal and Matanca.\r\n\r\nFour hundred miles to the north of Villa Boa, and nearly fifteen from\r\nthe margin of the Tucantines, is situated the arraial of Pontal, so\r\ncalled in consequence of a point or elbow which the river forms in its\r\nvicinity. It was founded in 1738, and has a parochial church dedicated\r\nto Senhor Bom Jesus, of Boa Morte. Its inhabitants breed cattle, and\r\ncultivate mandioca, Indian corn, legumes, and some cotton. All the\r\ndifferent species of fruit are known here.\r\n\r\nThe width of the Tucantines, at the passage from this arraial to\r\nthat of Carmo, which is distant thirty-five miles to the east, is\r\nthree hundred and seventy-four fathoms at the period of its greatest\r\ndiminution, and more than five hundred when its bed is full. Porto Real\r\nis the name of this passage.\r\n\r\nThe aldeia of Mantanca is ten miles to the north of Pontal, near\r\nthe origin of a small river, which after a course of twelve miles\r\nenters the Tucantines. It is yet insignificant, in consequence of the\r\ninvasions of the Indians, but it abounds with fish, game, and fruits.\r\nThe salubrity of the climate, the fertility of the soil, the abundance\r\nof water, the extensive neighbouring woods, and the gold which is\r\nknown to exist in the district, ought long ago to have produced an\r\naccumulating population, a great augmentation of the existing villages,\r\nand many other improvements; in which case its inhabitants would, ere\r\nthis, have reduced or put to flight the hostile Indians, and, besides,\r\nwould have been carrying on a great commercial intercourse with the\r\nmerchants of Gram Para. None of the comarcas of this province hold so\r\nadvantageous a situation for commerce.\r\n\r\nIn the angle of the confluence of the Araguaya with the Tucantines,\r\nthere is a prezidìo, or military detachment, to register the canoes\r\nwhich navigate by both rivers to the city of Para. This is the place\r\nwhere the before-mentioned decree of 1809 ordered the town of St. Joam\r\ndas Duas Barras to be founded, for the head of the comarca of that\r\nname. It is said, however, that this project, so well conceived, was\r\nnot effected, in consequence of the reefs with which this situation is\r\nencompassed, and which impeded the access of canoes. This probably was\r\nthe reason of two places being founded, one upon each river, higher up.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1775 were reduced the two savage nations of _Carajas_\r\nand _Javahes_, who possessed the island of St. Anna, or Bannanal.\r\nThe first were established in six aldeias, and the other in three,\r\nnearly the whole with names of places in Portugal; namely, Angeja\r\nand Seabra, both for the Carajas, near the southern extremity of the\r\nisland; the first near the eastern arm, and the other near the western;\r\nCunha, for the Javahes, thirty-five miles to the north of Angeja, and\r\nsome distance from the river; Annadia, for the Carajas, twenty-eight\r\nmiles to the north of Seabra, and near the river; St. Pedro, for the\r\nsame, and eighteen miles to the north-east of Cunha, near the margin of\r\nthe river; Ponte de Lima, for the Javahes, in the centre of the island;\r\nLavradio, fifty miles to the north of Annadia; Lamacaes, forty to the\r\nnorth; both for the Carajas, in the vicinity of the river; and Mello,\r\nfor the Javahes, some distance from the eastern arm. At this period\r\nthe name of Nova Beira was given to the neighbouring territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _District of_ TUCANTINES.\r\n\r\nIt is the most northern of the eastern districts, and borrows its name\r\nfrom the river which bounds it on the west, separating it from Nova\r\nBeira. On the east it is bounded by the cordillera which constitutes\r\nthe limit between this province and that of Pernambuco. The two rivers\r\nof Manuel Alvez did bound it, one on the north, and the other on the\r\nsouth; but, as it has increased towards the north, the limit on that\r\nside is not at present quite determinable. This district is computed\r\nto be two hundred and eighty miles long from north to south, and one\r\nhundred and forty of medium width.\r\n\r\nThe two rivers Manuel Alvez and Somno are the principal of those which\r\nwater this comarca. The latter, it is said, rises in the serra of\r\nFiguras, a continuation of the cordillera before alluded to, from whose\r\nsides others issue that augment its waters at the commencement. All\r\nthree are navigable, and afford the same fish as the Tucantines.\r\n\r\nIt is a country mountainous in great part, and yet occupied at its\r\nnorthern extremity by various barbarous nations, who follow hunting,\r\ndamage the farms of cattle breeders, and advance occasionally in\r\nsquadrons of canoes by the rivers that approximate to the Portuguese\r\nestablishments. They are of the _Xerente_, _Chavante_, and _Tapacoa_\r\ntribes. Woods exist almost only upon the margins of the rivers,\r\nthe principal portion consisting of sandy sterile lands, in part\r\nappropriated for breeding cattle. Calcareous stone abounds in some\r\nplaces. Gold gave origin to its establishments, and, while obtained\r\nwithout much ingenuity and labour, rendered many persons rich.\r\n\r\nThe principal povoaçoes are, Natividade, Chapada, and Carmo.\r\n\r\nSix miles distant from the right margin of the southern river of Manuel\r\nAlvez, and little less than thirty-five from the Tucantines, in the\r\nproximity of the morro of Olhos d’Agua, (so called from various rills\r\nthence emanating,) where there is gold, and near the small river St.\r\nAntonio, is the arraial of Natividade. It is the head of the julgado,\r\nwith the condition of a town, and the residence at present of the\r\nouvidor of the comarca. It was founded in 1739, and has a church, where\r\nthe festival of the Nativity of our Lord is held with much solemnity.\r\nIt has also two chapels dedicated to Rozario and Terco, and another\r\nof St. Benedicto. The culture of the cane, the cotton tree, tobacco,\r\nIndian corn, mandioca, and legumes, occupy the greater part of the\r\npopulation. Miners are few; as the produce (from not adopting a new\r\nmode) of the mines affords them no encouragement. Cattle are bred.\r\nOranges and citrons are excellent.\r\n\r\nNear seven miles to the north of Natividade is the small and agreeably\r\nsituated arraial of Chapada, with a chapel of St. Anna. The people who\r\ninhabit it cultivate the same productions as those of the former place,\r\nand are miners.\r\n\r\nFifty miles to the north-north-west of the preceding, and twenty from\r\nthe Tucantines, at the angle of the confluence of the small river\r\nSucuriu and the Matança, is the pleasant arraial of Carmo. It was\r\nfounded in 1741, in the proximity of a serra, ornamented with a mother\r\nchurch dedicated to St. Manuel, and a chapel of the Lady of Rozario.\r\nThe houses are built of _adobe_, a sort of brick dried in the sun.\r\nIts inhabitants drink the waters of the Sucuriu, which are excellent.\r\nThey are miners and agriculturists, and cultivate Indian corn, tobacco,\r\ncotton, sugar, mandioca, and legumes, with various hortulans and fruits.\r\n\r\nSeventy miles to the east of Natividade is the arraial of Almas, a\r\nlittle distance from the river Manuel Alvez and near the road of Duro.\r\nIts inhabitants cultivate the necessaries of life and cotton.\r\n\r\nForty miles to the east of the preceding, is the aldeia of Duro, upon\r\nthe boundary of the province, with a register for preventing the\r\nembezzlement of gold. The major part of its dwellers are Christianized\r\nIndians, poor and content with their condition, cultivating and\r\ncollecting only what is absolutely necessary to preserve life.\r\n\r\nA few leagues to the north of the aldeia of Duro is that of Formiga,\r\nalso peopled with Christianized Indians, who are equally indolent, are\r\nhunters, and more contented with gathering fruits from the wild trees,\r\nthan planting others of greater utility.\r\n\r\nBetween the mouth of the northern river Manuel Alvez and the first\r\npeninsula, is the new arraial of St. Pedro d’Alcantara, upon the margin\r\nof the Tucantines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _District of_ PARANNAN.\r\n\r\nThis district derives its name from the river which traverses it\r\ndiagonally. It is bounded on the north by the comarca of Tucantines,\r\non the west by that of Goyaz, on the south by the Rio das Velhas, and\r\non the east by the limits of the province. It is watered by a great\r\nnumber of rivers, interspersed with mountains, and better peopled\r\nthan the others, although still infested by the barbarians, who\r\nadvance up the principal rivers. In some districts there are many\r\npersons subject from their infancy to a disease in the throat, called\r\n_bronchocele_.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--Besides the Parannan and the Maranham, its western\r\nand southern limits, we may remark the river Trahiras of the south, the\r\nPreto, (both crossed by bridges), the Bagagem, the small Tucantines,\r\nthe Palma, the St. Feliz, (with a large bridge,) the Trahiras of the\r\nnorth, and the small river Custodio, both of difficult passage even\r\nin dry weather; the Gamelleiro, near whose mouth there is a rock of\r\nremarkable form and height, and the Bacalhau of considerable width. The\r\nwhole discharge into the Maranham, except the last, which unites itself\r\nwith the Bagagem by the left margin, and the Palma which joins the\r\nParannan.\r\n\r\nThe river Palma is formed by the Palmeiro, Mosquito, and Sobrado. The\r\nlatter, which is the most northerly, rises in a plain upon the summit\r\nof the wide serra of Mangabeira, and a few fathoms it is said, from the\r\norigin of the river Ondas, (which runs to the St. Francisco) and seven\r\nmiles below its source receives the Torno, a considerable stream which\r\nissues from among the roots of an over-spreading _gamelleira_ or\r\n_gamella_ tree, and has not a mile of course, being as voluminous\r\nat the commencement as at the embouchure.\r\n\r\nThe river Correntes, which is one of the first branches of the\r\nParannan, flows from the serra of St. Domingos, and after some leagues\r\nconceals itself for three miles by a subterraneous passage through a\r\nmountain, where its waters lose their colour and good quality. The\r\nriver Galheiro, which descends from the serra St. Domingos to the\r\nParannan, receives a small river, (called the St. Domingos) which runs\r\nfor a considerable space under ground, being only discoverable in\r\nsome places through apertures. Amongst other serras may be noted the\r\nViadeiros, which runs parallel with the river Parannan at the distance\r\nof eighteen miles. It is bare of vegetation or woods, and is the most\r\nelevated of the central ones. From it issues the river Tucantines and\r\nthe Preto.\r\n\r\nThe principal povoaçoes of this district are--\r\n\r\n    Aguaquente\r\n    Trahiras\r\n    St. Joze\r\n    St. Feliz\r\n    Cavalcante\r\n    Conceiçao\r\n    Arrayas\r\n    St. Domingos\r\n    Flores.\r\n\r\nTwo miles distant from the confluence of the river Almas with the\r\nMaranham, and seventy miles to the north-east of Pilar, is the arraial\r\nof Aguaquente, (Warm Water) situated near a large and deep lake of\r\nbrackish, fetid, and warm water, from which it derived the name. A\r\nchurch of St Sebastiao and a chapel of our Lady of Merces are its\r\nonly places of worship. It was commenced about the year 1732, in the\r\nfrontier situation, where some vestiges remain. An epidemical disease,\r\nproduced by standing and putrid pools of water, occasioned by the\r\nfloods of the Maranham, led those who wished to escape with life to\r\nthe place where this arraial is now situated. It was not unusual for\r\nfifty to die in one day. A numerous herd of oxen arriving from St.\r\nPaulo, for the supply of this arraial, where they were collected at\r\nnight, and pastured in its environs during the day, was the cause, it\r\nis stated, of this contagion ceasing. The gold, which was so abundant\r\nat first, induced an assemblage here of twelve thousand persons.\r\nAmongst other pieces of considerable size, one was found of forty-three\r\npounds weight, which was transmitted to the court, in the same form\r\nthat nature presented it. This rarity was placed in the Royal Museum\r\nof Lisbon; and became the booty of the French army when in that city.\r\nThere are some frightful caverns upon the margins of this lake, the\r\noutlet from which is a small perennial stream, not experiencing any\r\ndiminution during the droughts.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles to the east-north-east of Aguaquente is the arraial of\r\nCocal, so called from its great number of cocoa trees, and situated\r\nnear a small river which loses itself in the Maranham. Whilst gold was\r\nabundant this place flourished, but it is now very inconsiderable. The\r\narraial of Trahiras, twenty miles to the north-east of Aguaquente,\r\nlarge and flourishing, is the head of the julgado; it was founded\r\nin 1735, upon the left margin, and twenty miles above the mouth of\r\nthe river that gives it the name. It has a church of Nossa Senhora\r\nda Conceiçao, a hermitage of Bom Jesus, and another of Our Lady of\r\nRozario. It is well supplied with meat, fish, and the agricultural\r\nproductions of the country.\r\n\r\nFive miles to the north-east of Trahiras, is the middling arraial of\r\nSt. Joze de Tucantines, improperly so denominated, being nearly thirty\r\nmiles distant from that river. It was founded in 1735, near the left\r\nmargin of the river Bacalhau, and has two hermitages of Our Lady of Boa\r\nMorte and of Rozario, and another of St. Efigenia. Its church is the\r\nmost magnificent temple in the province. There is a brotherhood of the\r\nLord dos Passos[23] privileged by Pope Clement XIII.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve miles to the east of the preceding is the small arraial\r\nof Cachoeira, to which a cataract furnished the name, Cachoeira being\r\nfounded near it, upon the margin of the river, in the year 1736.\r\n\r\nTen miles to the north of Cachoeira is the small arraial of St. Ritta,\r\nfounded in the same year as the preceding, and possessing a chapel.\r\nTwenty-eight miles to the east of St. Ritta is the small arraial of\r\nMoquem, near the river Peixe, which is a branch of the Bagagem, having\r\na hermitage of the Lady of Abbadia.\r\n\r\nSt. Feliz, a well supplied arraial, in a state of mediocrity, and about\r\nseventy miles north of St. Joze, is situated near the right bank of\r\nthe small river of the same name, and less than three miles from the\r\nMaranham. It was founded in the year 1736, and has a church called\r\nafter the same saint, a hermida, or hermitage, of the Lady of Rozario,\r\nand one of St. Anna. It is the head of the julgado, and possessed for\r\na considerable time a smelting house for gold. Some of its inhabitants\r\nare yet miners; the rest breeders of cattle and cultivators of the\r\nnecessaries of life.\r\n\r\nThe Caldas of St. Feliz, (the hot baths or waters of St. Feliz,)\r\notherwise called Frey Raynaldo, are thirty-five miles further to the\r\nsouth, consisting of four springs of tepid, and one of very hot water.\r\n\r\nSeven miles to the north of St. Feliz, near the road, there is a mass\r\nof black stone, with so frightful and profound a cavern, that no one\r\nhas yet dared to examine it. Three miles more to the north is situated\r\nan aldeia, with a hermida of Our Lady of Carmo, from which it takes the\r\nname.\r\n\r\nCavalcante, a flourishing arraial, founded in 1740, has a church of\r\nSt. Anna, two hermidas of the Lady of Rozario and Boa Morte, and is\r\nseventy miles to the east of St. Feliz, near a small river which runs\r\nto the Parannan, under the name of Rio das Almas. It is the head\r\nof the julgado, well provided with water, and has a smelting house\r\ntransferred from St. Feliz. Its inhabitants form five companies of\r\nmilitia. It has a rich quarry, but deep and difficult to work. It would\r\nbecome important in the hands of an opulent company, and directed by\r\nintelligent persons. Cattle are bred within its district. Mandioca,\r\nIndian corn, some wheat, and cotton, are the articles of cultivation.\r\n\r\nSeventy miles to the north of St. Feliz, and not far removed from the\r\nmouth of the river Palma, is the arraial of Conceiçao, with a church of\r\nthe same name. It is the head of the julgado: the people who inhabit it\r\nare miners, breeders of cattle, farmers of such necessaries of life as\r\nprosper best in the country, and form four companies of militia. It is\r\nvery deficient in good water. Within its district is the small arraial\r\nof Principe, with a hermitage.\r\n\r\nArrayas is an arraial in a state of mediocrity, head of the julgado,\r\nhas a church of Our Lady of Remedios, was founded in the year 1740, and\r\nis fifty miles to the north-east of Cavalcante, near the origin of the\r\nriver from which it derives the name. Its environs are in great part\r\nmountainous, and abound with cattle, which constitute the wealth of the\r\ninhabitants, who are formed into four companies of militia.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles to the south-east of Arrayas, near a small river\r\nwhich runs into the Parannan, is the small arraial of Morro do Chapeo,\r\nfounded in 1779. A neighbouring mount, similar in appearance to a hat,\r\n(chapeo,) and from which gold is extracted, was the origin of its name.\r\nCattle constitute the riches of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nForty miles to the east of Morro do Chapeo, and in the skirts of the\r\nserra of its name, is the arraial and freguezia of St. Domingos,\r\nin the vicinity of which there is a rock of remarkable height and\r\nappearance. Its inhabitants breed cattle, and cultivate a variety of\r\nthe necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nA little to the east, upon the limits of the province, there is a\r\ndetachment to prevent the embezzlement of gold.\r\n\r\nFlores is a middling and well supplied arraial, and head of the\r\njulgado, has a church of Our Lady of Conceiçao, and a hermida of\r\nRozario, with a brotherhood of blacks. It is seventy miles to the\r\nsouth-east of Cavalcante, near the right margin of the river Parannan,\r\nin a fertile situation. Cattle and horses are the principal riches of\r\nits inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWithin its extensive bounds is situated the aldeia of Matto Grosso,\r\nwith a hermitage of the Lady of Piedade; and the small arraial of St.\r\nRoza, with another hermitage of that saint; and in whose district is\r\na remarkable cavern, with many stalactites, or crystallizations of\r\ndifferent forms.\r\n\r\nNinety miles to the south of Flores, and two miles from a lake\r\ndenominated Lagoa Feia, is the arraial of Coiros, formerly the head\r\nof the julgado, which pre-eminence, in 1774, was transferred to\r\nCavalcante. It has a church dedicated to St. Luzia, and a hermida,\r\nwhere the blacks celebrate the festival of Our Lady of Rozario. Within\r\nits extensive limits, large herds of cattle are bred.\r\n\r\nA law emanated on the 25th February, 1814, for the foundation of a town\r\nto be called St. Joam da Palma, in a situation determined upon at the\r\nembouchure of the river of the same name, to become the head of the\r\ncomarca of St. Joam das Duas Barras. In order to give it an immediate\r\ncommencement, and to accelerate its augmentation, all individuals were\r\nexempted from payment of the dizimos for the space of ten years who\r\nerected a house for their own habitation in this town, or within the\r\ncircle marked for its limits. By the same law, the town of St. Joam\r\ndas Duas Barras, ordered to be founded by a decree in 1809, was to\r\nbecome subject to this town.\r\n\r\nThe major part of the cattle bred in this district are consumed in the\r\nreconcave of Bahia, and in the comarca of the Ilheos.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _District of_ RIO DAS VELHAS.\r\n\r\nThis district, to which one of the rivers that traverse it lends the\r\nname, is bounded on the north by the district of Parannan, on the south\r\nby the province of St. Paulo, on the east by that of Minas Geraes,\r\nand on the west by the districts of Goyaz and Cayaponia. It is three\r\nhundred and fifty miles from north to south, and one hundred and\r\nseventy of medium width.\r\n\r\nBesides the river which affords it the name, and those which serve for\r\nits western and southern limits, it contains numerous others. Upon the\r\nroad of Meia Ponte to St. Paulo, amongst other small ones, are the\r\nCapivary, which is forded with difficulty even in dry weather, the\r\nPyracanjuba, the Peixe, (both with bridges,) all three discharging\r\nthemselves into the Corumba by the right bank; the Braco do Verissimo;\r\nthe Verissimo, which receives the former; the Parannahiba; and the\r\nsmall stream of Furnas, that flows through a plain, and on a sudden is\r\nprecipitated twenty fathoms into a profound abyss. A variety of birds\r\nbuild their nests in the cavities of the rock, and rear their young,\r\nin sight, and amidst the murmuring sounds of this fine cataract. The\r\nFurnas discharges itself soon afterwards into the Rio das Velhas.\r\nThe two Uberavas, _verdadeiro_, (the real one,) which runs into\r\nthe preceding, and the _falso_, (or false,) that enters the\r\nRio Grande. The small river Inferno which issues from the serra of\r\nCanastra, and enters the Rio das Velhas by the left; the river Quebra\r\nAnzoes, that originates on the confines of Minas Geraes, and also\r\nunites itself with the Rio das Velhas by the right margin; but none of\r\nthem reach the road, near which the river Prata and the Tijuco rise,\r\nand, after uniting, enter the river Parannahiba a considerable distance\r\nbelow the confluence of the Rio das Velhas.\r\n\r\nOn the road of Paracatu is met with (besides the afore-mentioned\r\nCorumba) the river Areas, the Montes Claros, the Pont’ Alta, (all\r\nwith bridges,) and the St. Bartholomew. The whole are stored with a\r\ndiversity of fish, and flow southward.\r\n\r\nIn the most northern part of the district is the river Almas, the\r\nPeixe, which unites with the first by the right, and the Patos, that\r\nflows along and to the east of the serra Negra, and afterwards joins\r\nthe Maranham a few leagues above the arraial of Aguaquente. These\r\nrivers possess the same fish as the Tucantines.\r\n\r\nThe territory lying between the two Uberavas is a plain of thirty-five\r\nmiles in width, without the least elevation above the horizon, and\r\nabsolutely destitute of wood; but supplying the deer and the emu\r\nostrich.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the last century there lived, between the Parannahiba\r\nand the Rio Grande, a horde of Bororos, whose cacique was then a\r\nPaulista, called Antonio Pirez de Campos, a youth of much subtilty,\r\nand well adapted for the management of those savages amongst whom he\r\nsought refuge, being driven from civilized society by the extent of\r\nhis crimes. He died, between the years 1750 and 1760, of a wound which\r\nhe received in the arm, in an encounter with the Cayapos. His comrades\r\napplied medicinally, for many days, hot broiled bacon to the wound,\r\nuntil they conveyed him to a Christianized establishment in Minas\r\nGeraes, to try if he could be there cured. They lamented for a month\r\nover him as a common father.\r\n\r\nAmongst other serras in the northern part is that of Caldas, four\r\nleagues square, and flat upon the summit, where there are some lakes\r\nand deer.\r\n\r\nThe principal povoaçoes are Meia Ponte, Santa Luzia, Santa Cruz, St.\r\nDomingos, and Desemboque.\r\n\r\nMeia Ponte is the largest, most flourishing, and commercial povoaçao\r\nin the province, with the exception of the capital, from which it is\r\nninety miles distant to the east, and is situated near the Almas,\r\nwhich there is only an inconsiderable stream. It has a church of\r\nNossa Senhora of Rozario, four hermidas, three dedicated to Our Lady,\r\nwith the titles of Carmo, Lapa, and Rozario, of the blacks, another\r\nof the Lord of Bom Fim, and an Hospicio d’Esmoleres (an alms-house\r\nfor the entertainment of the travelling brotherhood) of Terra Santa.\r\nIt was founded in the year 1731, is the head of the julgado, well\r\nsupplied with meat and fish, and has a royal professor of Latin. Its\r\ninhabitants, and those of the environs, cultivate Indian corn, wheat,\r\nmandioca, tobacco, cotton, sugar, some coffee, and breed cattle;\r\nlikewise many hogs. They manufacture certain descriptions of cloth,\r\nboth of wool and cotton; and hence this place is considered the\r\ncradle and centre of the agriculture and industry of the province.\r\nThe caravans from the capital and from Cuiaba, proceeding to the\r\nmetropolis, to St. Paulo, or Bahia, pass this way.\r\n\r\nAbout eighteen miles to the east-north-east is the cordillera called\r\nMontes Pyreneos, (the Pyrenees.) From its sides flow torrents to the\r\nfour cardinal points.\r\n\r\nNearly fifty miles to the east of Meia Ponte, in the vicinity of some\r\nfine hills, denominated Montes Claros, there is a hermida of St.\r\nLuzia, which ornamented the decayed arraial of St. Antonio.\r\n\r\nSt. Luzia, a middling and well supplied arraial, which derives its\r\nname from the patroness of the church, is seven miles from the road of\r\nParacatu, and almost at an equal distance from the rivers Pont’ Alta\r\nand St. Bartholomew, being eighteen miles, with little difference,\r\nfrom each, in a pleasant and wholesome situation, abounding with\r\nwater. It is the head of the julgado, has a hermitage of Our Lady of\r\nRozario, produces good cheese and marmalade, and is seventy miles\r\neast-south-east of Meia Ponte. In its environs cattle are exceedingly\r\nabundant, constituting the wealth of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSt. Cruz, a small arraial, with a church of the Lady of Conceiçao, is\r\nthe most ancient of the province, and head of the julgado. It is one\r\nhundred miles to the south-south-east of Meia Ponte, upon the road of\r\nSt. Paulo, a little removed from the left margin of the river Pary, and\r\nabout one mile from the morro of Clemente, abounding with gold, which\r\nhas not yet been worked for the want of water; because, according to\r\nthe saying of the miners here, “a mountain of gold is worth nothing,\r\nif it has not water.” Its inhabitants are agriculturists and cattle\r\nbreeders. In its district are the _caldas_, or hot springs of the\r\nsame name, consisting of various fountains, differing in the degree of\r\nheat, and little distant from each other. Their waters, which have been\r\nefficacious in many diseases, form the small river Caldas.\r\n\r\nAlmost in the middle of the interval from St. Cruz to Meia Ponte, and\r\nalso upon the road, is the small arraial of Bom Fim, with a hermitage\r\nof that name. The inhabitants are gold miners, breed cattle, and\r\ncultivate the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and forty miles to the south of St. Cruz is the arraial\r\nof St. Anna, two miles distant from the northern margin of the river\r\nVelhas, in an agreeable situation, and is the parochial of all the\r\nChristianized Indians, who live in those parts, near the road of St.\r\nPaulo. It was founded in the year 1741, for the habitation of five\r\nhundred Bororo Indians, who came from Cuiaba to succour the Christians\r\nagainst the Cayapos, who carried devastation amongst the Portuguese\r\nestablishments. They lived here till the year 1775, when they were\r\nremoved to the arraial of Lanhozo, a horde of _Chacriaba_ Indians\r\nremaining in their stead, who were brought from the margins of Rio\r\nPreto, in the province of Pernambuco, and who are at present the\r\ninhabitants of the place, with some of other nations. They cultivate\r\nmandioca, Indian corn, and legumes.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles to the north of the parish of St. Anna, and also near\r\nthe same road, upon the northern margin of the small river Pedras, is\r\nsituated the aldeia of that name, formerly inhabited by Bororos, but\r\nnow almost depopulated, in consequence of that horde being removed in\r\n1811 to the new prezidios of Nova Beira. The arraial of Lanhozo above\r\nmentioned, founded near the Uberava Falso, no longer exists, its people\r\nhaving united themselves with those of the river Pedras.\r\n\r\nThe arraial of St. Domingos do Araxa, in a state of mediocrity,\r\nmodernly erected into the head of the julgado, is situated in a\r\nplain traversed by a small stream, and is thirty miles distant\r\nfrom the boundary, and twenty from the river Quebr’ Anzoes, (Hook\r\nBreaker.) The wells of excellent water, which save the breeders from\r\nthe expense of purchasing salt for the cattle, and the considerable\r\nportions of fertile land in which various branches of agriculture will\r\nflourish, have already invited many hundred families to remove their\r\nestablishments here, and which will probably in a few years render this\r\nparish the most populous one in the province. They already manufacture\r\ncotton cloth, and are commencing upon woollens. Large quantities of\r\nhogs and cattle are bred.\r\n\r\nThe arraial of Desemboque, head of the julgado, has a church of Our\r\nLady of Desterro, and is situated upon the left margin of the river\r\nVelhas, about thirty-five miles distant from the boundary of Minas\r\nGeraes. Its inhabitants breed cattle, and cultivate an abundance of the\r\nnecessaries of life.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1812, the arraial of St. Antonio and St. Sebastiao were\r\ncommenced, with a hermitage dedicated to those saints, near the channel\r\nof the Lage, two miles distant from the road of St. Paulo to the east,\r\nand one from the left margin of the Uberava Falso. The people who\r\ninhabit it cultivate feijao, Indian corn, rice, and cotton, with the\r\nfruits and hortulans of the country, and breed cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP.

It is nearly four hundred miles long from north to\r\nsouth, and two hundred and eighty of medium width, extending from 15°\r\n30′ to 21° 40′. The climate is temperate compared with others of the\r\ntorrid zone, arising from the elevated and mountainous nature of this\r\nprovince. The winter commences in October, always with thunder. Some\r\nyears, in the months of June and July, towards the southern part, cold\r\nand frost are prevalent, and water congeals in vessels exposed to the\r\nnight air.\r\n\r\nGold, which is found in all the districts of this province, was the\r\norigin of its name, (General Mines,) and which becomes still more\r\nappropriate, since all other metals are ascertained to exist here.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this country is owing to the intrepidity of S. F.\r\nTourinho, an inhabitant of Porto Seguro, who, proceeding up the river\r\nDoce, in 1573, traversed it as far as the Jequitinhonha, by which he\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\nA few years afterwards A. D. Adorno, with a view of profiting by the\r\nmines of emeralds discovered by Tourinho, advanced, with one hundred\r\nand fifty whites and four hundred Indians, up the Cricare, and came\r\nback by the same river as his precursor.\r\n\r\nMany years had elapsed when, with the same project, M. d’Azevedo\r\npenetrated into this country as far as the lake Vupabussu.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, a Thaubateno, A. Rodriguez, entered the certam of Cuyate,\r\naccompanied by fifty men; but discord interrupted their proceedings,\r\nand Rodriguez returned by the capitania of Espirito Santo, where he\r\nexhibited three oitavas (a drachm each) of gold, to demonstrate that\r\nhe had traversed auriferous lands. Proceeding to Rio de Janeiro, and\r\nthence to Thaubate, he soon expired, in consequence of the exhausted\r\nstate he was reduced to by the fatigues and privations of the\r\nenterprise, previously recommending his brother-in-law, Bartholomew\r\nBueno, to persevere in this project.\r\n\r\nImpelled by the poverty to which extravagancies had reduced him, Bueno\r\nset out, in 1694, upon the enterprise, accompanied by Captain M.\r\nd’Almeida and other persons, directing their course by the heads of the\r\nserras pointed out in the diary of the late Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nCaptain M. Garcia, accompanied by Colonel S. Fernandez and other\r\nadventurers, actuated by similar motives, took their departure in the\r\nfollowing year; met with Bueno at the serra of Itaberava, near thirty\r\nmiles to the south of Villa Rica, and returned the first with twelve\r\noitavas of gold, which led to the establishment of a melting house in\r\nthe town of Thaubate.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance caused a great many Paulistas to undertake various\r\nother voyages, in spite of the fatigues and dangers with which they\r\nwere beset; not as hitherto in capturing savages, but in the animating\r\npursuit of gold. With this view numbers formed establishments in the\r\nprovince. Hence arose the envy which subsisted between the Thaubatenos\r\nand Piratininganos, who never associated in their mining expeditions.\r\n\r\nWith the project of finding gold F. D. Paes penetrated the certams of\r\nSerro Frio, and arriving at the situation of Anhonhecanhuva, (which\r\nin the Indian idiom signifies “water that hides itself,”) at present\r\ncalled Sumidoiro, (“to swallow up,”) he dwelt there more than three\r\nyears, undertaking various journeys during the time into Sabara\r\nBussu, where he found, in the serra Negra, precious stones; which not\r\nsatisfying him he retroceded as far as the serra Tucambira, (the crop\r\nor maw of the Tucano,) and from thence to the river Itamarindiba, (a\r\nsmall rolling stone,) where, from its having fish, he remained for\r\nsome time. Although his party was diminished by the desertion of the\r\nmajor part in the serra Negra, impatient at their long stay there,\r\nhe determined to visit the lake Vupabussu, (Large Lake,) which he\r\nultimately found, after a laborious search; and was also directed, by\r\nan Indian which he had taken, to the emerald mines. On the return of\r\nthis certanista towards St. Paulo, he died near the river Velhas, where\r\nhe fortunately met with, amongst other countrymen, Manuel de Borba\r\nGato, his son-in-law, to whom he left the golden fruits of all his\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time D. Rodrigo de Castello Branco entered the country,\r\nwith the appointment of superintendent of the mines, and wishing\r\nalso to participate in the credit of discovering the emerald mines,\r\non his arrival at the river Velhas sent to beg of M. de Borba Gato a\r\npart of the equipment and provisions left him by Paez. His refusal to\r\ncomply with this request occasioned some menacing words to escape from\r\nBranco, which were sufficient to cause his assassination basely by a\r\nservant of Gato, to whom General A. de Sa offered a pardon, in the name\r\nof the King, on condition of his pointing out the copious mines of\r\nSabara, discovered by him. Those conditions being fulfilled, the rank\r\nof lieutenant-general was unwisely and undeservedly granted to this\r\ninstigator of murder.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of gold attracted a great number of Paulistas and\r\nEuropeans to this province, between whom obstinate disputes arose, and\r\na prolonged civil war.\r\n\r\nM. N. Vianna, a native of the town of Vianna, was chief of the\r\nEuropean party, who had appointed him governor of the new mines, when\r\nA. d’Albuquerque Coelho, the first general of the province of St.\r\nPaulo, with prudence and power, terminated, in 1710, the sanguinary\r\ndissensions between the disputants.\r\n\r\nThis province, whilst a comarca of that of St. Paulo, and before it\r\nhad generals for governors, was various times visited by those of Rio\r\nde Janeiro, not only at the period of the disorders caused by the\r\nPaulistas and Europeans but anterior to the conclusion of the strifes\r\nthat existed among the Piratininganos and Thaubatenos.\r\n\r\nD. Lourenço d’Almeyda was the first general of the province, which\r\nappointment was bestowed upon him with much splendour in the church\r\nof Our Lady of Pilar, of Villa Rica, on the 18th of August, 1720.\r\nThis province is now, comparatively speaking, tolerably populous, and\r\ndivided into four comarcas.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--It is the most mountainous country in the Brazil. The serra\r\nMantiqueira, which is the most celebrated in the province, commences\r\nin the northern part of that of St. Paulo; from thence, running almost\r\nnorth-east, not without many windings, as far as the town of Barbacena,\r\nwhere it inclines northward to the extremity of the province, varying\r\nits direction, elevation, and name, and extending many branches from\r\nboth sides of greater or less extent and height. It bounds in part all\r\nthe comarcas.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--None of the other provinces are so abundant in water, and the\r\ngreater part of its rivers have their origin in the Mantiqueira Serra,\r\nand their egress in general by four channels; two flowing eastward,\r\nnamely the Doce and the Jequitinhonha; the St. Francisco northward; and\r\nthe Rio Grande westward. The first irrigates the comarca of Villa Rica,\r\nthe second that of Serro Frio, the third that of Sabara, and the last\r\nthat of St. Joao d’el Rey.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Gold, platina, silver, and brass, iron, pewter, lead,\r\nmercury, antimony, bismuth, amianthus, talk, calcareous stone, granite,\r\nblack jasper marked with white; _amolar_, or grindstone, fossil-coal,\r\nsaltpetre; white, red, yellow, grey, and black argils; diamonds,\r\nrubies, emeralds, chrysolites, topazes, sapphires, _aqua-marinas_,\r\nagates, amethysts, petrifactions, (_pingos d’agua_,) crystals,\r\nflintstone, and _pedra sabao_, of a pearl colour, very compact and\r\nheavy, but easily worked; images, candlesticks, and vessels by the\r\nturner are made of this stone. It affords excellent chalk, and its very\r\nfine dust is sought after by travellers. Many profound caverns and\r\nexcavations are met with, from whence immense quantities of gold have\r\nbeen extracted. Some rocks are perforated from one side to the other;\r\nothers have disappeared entirely, in the course of withdrawing their\r\nrich contents. Many mountains frequently reverberate, demonstrating\r\nthat they are fully charged with minerals. A great number of torrents\r\nhave been diverted, for a greater or less space, from their natural\r\nbeds, to facilitate the extraction of gold and diamonds.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--All the species of Spanish domestic animals are bred here;\r\nthe oxen and hog are the most numerous; the savage quadrupeds and birds\r\nmet with in the adjoining provinces are common in this. The population\r\nprincipally consists of negroes, the property of the miner and the\r\nagriculturist. Indians exist only upon the eastern boundaries of the\r\nprovince. Many persons of all complexions are met with of the age of\r\none hundred years.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--The soil produces in abundance the first year; the second\r\nusually little, and in the third almost nothing; it is therefore\r\nrequisite, according to the present mode of agriculture, to allow it\r\nto remain fallow for some years, until it is covered with a strong\r\nbrushwood, which is then burnt down to form the first coat of manure.\r\n\r\nHere are cultivated mandioca, tobacco, sugar, (the greater part\r\nof which is distilled into spirit,) cotton, (part of which is\r\nmanufactured into cloth,) wheat, rye, and a great quantity of white\r\nIndian corn, the dry flour of which is the ordinary bread; this corn,\r\nafter the skin is taken off, dressed, and sweetened with sugar, is a\r\ndainty introduced into every banquet, and is called _cangica_.\r\nAlso are grown potatoes, legumes, hortulans, coffee, and indigo.\r\nAmongst other medicinal plants, there are ipecacuanha, columbo root,\r\nliquorice, jalap, a species of spikenard upon the serra Caraça;\r\nvanilla, and the _urucu_ dye tree. Amongst the resinous trees, are\r\nremarked the gum-copal, gum-mastick, benzoin, and _angico_. In\r\nsome places are the storax, and the oil of cupahiba tree; in others the\r\n_barbatimoes_, its leaves nourishing the _cantharidas_, which\r\nis a lucrative branch of commerce. Some trees furnish fine bark, some\r\nashes for the soap-house, others venom, with which fish are killed,\r\nand the upper bark of a tree which supplies the real _quina_, or\r\nJesuit’s bark. There is a variety of the palm, and of trees affording\r\nfine timber for building. The cedar is common in some situations, and\r\nthe Brazilian pine grows in the southern part, near the skirts of\r\nserras. There is a shrub differing from the _myrica cerifera_,\r\nthe trunk and branches of which are always covered with a species of\r\nwax; also the _verniz_, or varnish tree, with which the Indians\r\ndye their _cuyas_ (clay cups.) Almost all the fruit trees of\r\nPortugal are naturalized here, but none of them improve; the peach and\r\nquince alone fructify abundantly; from the latter, a large quantity\r\nof sweetmeats are made. The _cajue_, the _jabuticaba_, the\r\n_araticu_, and the _mangaba_ fruits are common; also oranges,\r\nlimes, bananas, pine-apples, and water-melons.\r\n\r\nFrom this province are exported hides, skins of deer, and of other wild\r\nanimals; coarse cotton and woollen cloth, tobacco, coffee, fruits,\r\nsugar, cheese, pork, _pedra sabao_, precious stones, saltpetre,\r\nmarmalade, &c. The whole is conducted to the metropolis upon mules,\r\nwhich proceed in caravans of one hundred and more, divided into troops\r\nof seven, managed by one muleteer. Their return cargo consists of salt,\r\nand other dry and moist goods.\r\n\r\nThe treasury, besides the diamonds, fifths of gold, dizimos, duties\r\nupon negroes and goods introduced from the ports, of cattle, horses,\r\nand mules, entering from St. Paulo, receives a considerable revenue on\r\nthe passage of rivers by bridges and barks, which are numerous.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1808, the circulation of gold dust, till then, the only\r\ncirculating medium, was prohibited, and coins of the three current\r\nmetals substituted.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1714, this province was divided into four comarcas; namely,\r\n\r\n    COMARCAS.

The serra of Oiro\r\nBranco, (White Gold,) to the south of the preceding, the Serra Negra,\r\nwith mines of iron, and the Serra Lappa are both to the north of the\r\ncapital. Nearly thirty miles north of Marianna is the celebrated\r\nSerra Caraça, so called from having a portion similar to an enormous\r\nphysiognomy. It is a dismemberment of the grand cordillera, with near\r\nfifty miles of circuit at its base, being steep and craggy all around.\r\nOn a plain about three miles square, in a broken part of its summit,\r\nthere is a species of monastery, where various hermits dwell, some\r\ndrawn thither by devotion, and others from persecution; their habit\r\nis a black cassock. They sustain themselves upon charity, and the\r\nproductions of the adjacent land, where they raise cattle and rye. The\r\nedifice is of stone; the church of elegant architecture, and dedicated\r\nto Our Lady May dos Homens (Mother of Men). In the garden there are\r\nvarious European fruit trees, such as the apple, pear, plum, cherry,\r\nquince, chestnut, olive, and walnut; also trees from the oak to the\r\nyellow broom and furze. The land is watered by various rivulets, which\r\nafter uniting flow to the Percicaba. In its vicinity is the serra of\r\nItaubira, which terminates in two rocky pyramids. Between the river\r\nDoce and the Parahiba, there is an extensive branch of the Mantiqueira\r\nserra, from whence emanate many torrents; the Serra Frecheira is the\r\nname of a portion.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The Doce, which is the largest of the comarca, has its origin\r\nin the serra of Mantiqueira. After flowing for a considerable space\r\nto the north-north-east, under the name of Chopoto, it receives the\r\nPiranga, which runs from the serra of Oiro Branco; afterwards the\r\nGuallacho, formed by two streams of the same name distinguished by the\r\nappellations of north and south, and which issue from the serra of\r\nOiro Preto. At this confluence it inclines to the east, and gathers\r\nthe Bombaca and the Percicaba, which flow from the west, and have\r\ntheir sources in the Serra Lapa. Here it takes the name by which it\r\nenters the ocean. A little lower it is united also on the left, by\r\nthe considerable river St. Antonio, which comes from the north-west,\r\ntraversing an extensive territory, abounding mainly in cattle. Of the\r\nstreams which form it, some descend from the Serra Lapa, others from\r\nSerro Frio. Ten miles further, it is joined on the same side by the\r\nCorrente, which flows from Serro Frio, with more than one hundred miles\r\nof course. Thirty miles lower, it receives the large Sassuhy, whose\r\nheads emanate from the serras of Serro Frio and Esmeraldas; its margins\r\nare thinly inhabited. After it follows the Laranjeiras, in the same\r\ndirection, between woods abounding with wild beasts and savages. The\r\nCuyate, which runs north-east, is the largest of those which enter it\r\non the right; its mouth is a little below the preceding, and it gives\r\nthe name to an interior district inhabited by Indians. The Manhuassu,\r\n(which some say is larger than Cuyate,) after flowing through large\r\nwoods north-eastward, and bounding the certam of Cuyate, is lost in the\r\nDoce, a little above the Escadinhas.\r\n\r\nAmongst others, the Doce has four remarkable falls: Escura, a little\r\nbelow the mouth of the Percicaba; Magoaris, a short way below the\r\nCorrente; Ibiturunas, a short distance above the Sassuhy; and\r\nInferno, between the confluences of the Cuyate and the Manhuassu. The\r\nadjacent territory of this fine river is mostly of great fertility;\r\nin some places the root of the mandioca grows to a prodigious size.\r\nIndependently of the above obstacles, the Doce is navigable for a\r\ngreat extent, and I was assured by an ouvidor, having a neighbouring\r\njurisdiction, that no very great expenditure on the part of the\r\ngovernment would render it the most important and certainly the best\r\nmedium of transit for the produce of the interior districts of Brazil.\r\nThe Maquipoo is one of its first tributaries received on the right, and\r\nenters a little above the mouth of the Bombaca.\r\n\r\nThe Preto originates in the serra Ititiaya, a branch of the Mantiqueira\r\nrange, and runs eastward through the territory of the Ararys, bounding\r\nthe province, until it enters the Parahibuna, which latter rises near\r\nthe Chopoto, and flows into the Parahiba.\r\n\r\nThe Pomba, which as has been observed, is a tributary of the Parahiba,\r\nwaters an extensive tract on the southern part of this comarca, and\r\npasses near the parish of St. Manuel, whose inhabitants are Coroado\r\nand Crapo Indians, with some whites, principally raising Indian corn,\r\nlegumes, some sugar, and numerous hogs. The fertility of the country,\r\nwith the navigation of the river, promises it a future increase. Its\r\nchurch is forty miles from the mouth of the river.\r\n\r\nVilla Rica, antecedently Oiro Preto, was created a town in 1711, and is\r\nlarge, populous, abundant, and flourishing. It is the capital of the\r\nprovince, and the residence of the governor, at present Don Manuel de\r\nPortugal e Castro; likewise of the ouvidor of the comarca, who holds\r\nother offices, serving also as crown judge with jurisdiction over the\r\nwhole province. It has a Juiz de Fora, who is also attorney-general; a\r\nvicar-general, and professors, I had almost forgot royal, of primitive\r\nletters, Latin, and philosophy. This town is ill situated at the\r\nsouthern base of the serra of Oiro Preto, amongst gloomy rocks, upon\r\nvery uneven ground, and frequently covered with fogs, which are said to\r\ncause amongst the inhabitants continued colds or defluxions from the\r\nhead. There is a house of misericordia, founded by G. F. d’Andrade,\r\nin virtue of a law of the 16th April, 1738; a smelting house; a\r\njunta of the treasury, composed of four deputies, the ouvidor of the\r\ncomarca, the attorney-general, the general treasurer, and the auditor,\r\nwith the governor as president. It has ten chapels, of the Lord Bom\r\nFim, Almas, St. Anna, St. Joam, &c.; besides three Terceira orders\r\nof St. Francisco d’Assis, Carmo, and St. Francisco de Paula, almost\r\nall of which, with four bridges, are of stone. The palace, military\r\nquarters, and municipal house, are considered to be handsome; the\r\nlatter has an annual revenue of about fifteen thousand crusades. It\r\nhas a fort with some pieces of ordnance, which are fired occasionally\r\non holidays; fourteen fountains of crystalline water, and a hospital.\r\nIts inhabitants, principally miners and dealers, live in two parishes,\r\ncalled Our Lady of Pilar and Conceiçao. This town is two hundred and\r\nthirty miles north-north-west of Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nThere are in Villa Rica twenty-five judicial appointments. The smelting\r\nhouse has sixteen official situations; the office of _Intendente_,\r\nwhich afforded annually five thousand two hundred and fifty crusades,\r\nindependently of perquisites, has been discontinued here as well as\r\nin all similar establishments in the Brazil. In the treasury, besides\r\nthe deputies already mentioned, there are sixteen other situations,\r\nthe most lucrative of which is the _Escrivao Contador_, (the\r\nauditor of the treasury,) having three thousand crusades annually; and\r\nthe smallest is that of _Continuo_, (a sergeant, or beadle,) not\r\nhaving more than one hundred and fifty milreas (about thirty-seven\r\npounds.) There is also a tribunal entitled “Junta of the conquest\r\nand civilization of the Indians and navigation of the river Doce,”\r\nestablished in 1808. Its principal object is to promote agriculture\r\nupon the margins of that river, which, however, advances very slowly.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Villa Rica, and of six parishes within its district,\r\nform two regiments of auxiliary cavalry, fourteen companies of whites,\r\nseven of mulattoes, and four of free blacks.\r\n\r\nEight miles to the west of Villa Rica is the arraial and freguezia of\r\nSt. Bartholomew, famous for the large quantity of marmalade that is\r\nexported from it.\r\n\r\nTen miles to the north-west of Villa Rica is the freguezia or parish of\r\nOur Lady of Nazareth da Cachoeira, where the governors have a house of\r\nrecreation, occasionally passing some days there in the amusement of\r\nshooting deer and partridges.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles to the south-east of Villa Rica is the considerable\r\narraial of Piranga, situated near the river of the same name, with\r\na church of the Lady of Conceiçao, and a chapel of Rozario. The\r\ninhabitants cultivate the necessaries of life, and a large quantity of\r\ntobacco, to which the soil is very favourable.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the river Piranga, within the district of the parish\r\nof St. Antonio d’Itaberava to the south of Villa Rica, is the large\r\narraial of Catas Altas da Noruega, with a chapel of St. Gonçalo.\r\n\r\nMarianna, originally the arraial of Carmo, until 1711, when John V.\r\nbestowed upon it a register of royal duties, and the name of Villa Leal\r\ndo Carmo, (Loyal Town of Carmo.) It was created an episcopal city in\r\n1745, by the same monarch, with the name of his consort. It is small,\r\nwell supplied, and situated in a gently elevated country, near the\r\nright margin of the Ribeiro, or stream of Carmo, with the chapels of\r\nOur Lady of Rozario, St. Pedro, Santa Anna, St. Gonçalo, St. Francisco,\r\nfor the mulattoes, and Mercez, for the creolian blacks; also two\r\nTerceira orders of Carmo and St. Francisco, whose chapel is elegant.\r\nThere are two squares, and seven fountains of good water. The streets\r\nare paved, and the houses of stone. The municipal house is one of the\r\nbest structures, and has water within it; the cathedral, dedicated\r\nto the Lady of Assumpçao, is more elegant than solid. The episcopal\r\npalace is handsome; the seminary spacious, the chapter is composed of\r\nfourteen canons, including the dignitaries of archdeacon, archpriest,\r\nchanter, and treasurer-mor, with whom twelve chaplains, and four young\r\nchoristers officiate. The Juiz de Fora presides over the orphans and\r\nthe senate, which has eleven thousand crusades of annual revenue. He\r\nfills other situations, and has, besides, twenty public officers under\r\nhis inspection. All the inhabitants of Marianna are parishioners of the\r\ncathedral, and, with those of its surrounding twelve parishes, form\r\ntwo regiments of cavalry, twenty companies of infantry, (all whites,)\r\nten of mulattoes, and five of free blacks. This city is eight miles\r\neast-north-east of Villa Rica; the intervening road is paved in parts,\r\nand bordered with many houses, having near it two arraials, and passes\r\nthree stone bridges.\r\n\r\nEight miles to the north-east of Marianna, near the arraial of Antonio\r\nPereira, (its founder,) in a rock at the end of a delightful valley, is\r\na grotto formed by nature, and converted into a small chapel, dedicated\r\nto the Lady of Lapa, where every Sunday mass is chanted, and a festival\r\ntakes place on the 15th of August. The roof, which is of calcareous\r\nstone, is overspread with stalactites, or crystallizations formed by\r\nthe filtration of the water.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles north of the same city is the arraial and parish of\r\nInficionado, which derived its name from the circumstance of the refuse\r\nof gold in melting being at first excellent, and becoming afterwards\r\ninferior, so that it acquired the name of Oiro Inficionado, (Infected\r\nGold.) It is the native country of the poet, who was the author of the\r\npoem of _Caramuru_, “the Man of Fire,” a conspicuous character in\r\nthe history of Bahia. Its church is dedicated to the Lady of Nazareth.\r\nThe inhabitants raise the necessaries of life and cattle, and are\r\nminers.\r\n\r\nCatas Altas de Matto Dentro, (profound searchings within the matto, or\r\nwoods,) formerly a large and flourishing arraial, with a church of the\r\nLady of Conceiçao, has fallen into decay with the decrease of gold. The\r\ndeep mines, wrought for the extraction of gold, were the origin of its\r\nname. It is about eight miles from the preceding, and the inhabitants\r\nare agriculturists, including breeders of cattle and miners.\r\n\r\nNine miles from Catas Altas is the large, flourishing, and commercial\r\narraial of St. Barbara, near the stream of the same name, having\r\nvarious religious structures, and promising considerable augmentation.\r\nThe occupations of its inhabitants are similar to that of the last\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nTen miles from St. Barbara is the arraial of Cocaes, with rich mines of\r\ngold, in the district of the parish of St. Joao do Morro Grande.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Comarca of_ RIO DAS MORTES.\r\n\r\nThe comarca of Rio das Mortes, so called from the river which washes\r\nit, and equally known by the name of its head town, St. Joao d’el Rey,\r\nis bounded on the east by the comarca of Villa Rica; on the north\r\nby that of Sabara, from which it is separated by the serra Negra,\r\nand by the rivers Lambary and Andayha; on the west by the provinces\r\nof Goyaz and St. Paulo; and on the south by the latter and that of\r\nRio de Janeiro. It is computed to comprise one hundred and seventy\r\nsquare miles. This comarca has many portions of land appropriated\r\nto the culture of mandioca, Indian corn, and legumes; likewise to\r\nplantations of sugar and tobacco, which are the most lucrative articles\r\nof exportation; in some places the cotton tree prospers, and in some\r\nof the southern districts considerable quantities of rye and wheat are\r\nraised. Cows are generally abundant, also sheep and hogs. Pork and\r\ncheese are important branches of export. There are auriferous grounds,\r\nwhich occupy a great many people in the working of them.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The principal are the serra of Lenheiro, in the vicinity\r\nof the town of St. Joao d’el Rey; of St. Joze, near the town of that\r\nname; of Lopo, not far from Cabo Verde; of Assumpçao, on the western\r\npart, between the Rio Grande and the Pardo; of Parida, which serves as\r\na limit on the same side from the Rio Grande northward. In the southern\r\npart there is the extensive Mantiqueira, in parts bare and rocky, in\r\nothers covered with wood. It contains the _Cachineze_ Indians, who are\r\ninconsiderable in number, stinted in growth, and timorous, and confine\r\ntheir hostility to robbing the neighbouring parishes of some cattle.\r\nThe serra of Juruoca, which is a branch of the preceding, takes the\r\nname of a stone called _ayuru_, “parrot,” and _oca_, “stone,” and which\r\nstands upon it where there is a cataract seventy yards in height. The\r\nserra of Carrancas is situated between the Rio Grande and Verde. The\r\nserra of Letras, (or Letters,) a branch of the preceding, derives\r\nits name from a species of hieroglyphic, a natural curiosity, which\r\nis observed in the interior of a vast and curious cave, formed of\r\ndivers eruptions or projections of a sandy stone, some of considerable\r\nelasticity with various kinds of plants which grow there. The pretended\r\nletters, owing their origin to ferruginous particles, are rude and\r\nillegible, and no more than a superstitious hierography, arising in the\r\nignorance of the people, who attribute them to the hand of the apostle\r\nSt. Thomas. Near it there is a hermitage dedicated to the same apostle.\r\nThe serra of Vigia, so called from having served for a long time as\r\na watch-tower to the sentinels of a band of runaway negroes, who had\r\nestablished themselves in that district, is twenty miles distant from\r\nSt. Joao d’el Rey. The serra Cachambu is between the river Jacare and\r\nthe Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The Rio Grande, the largest of the comarca, dividing it into\r\nsouthern and northern, and having its origin upon the serra Juruoca,\r\nafter gathering many small streams, flows at first northward, then\r\nnorth-west for a considerable space, and receives the large river Das\r\nMortes, which rises in the serra of Oiro Branco, from whence it runs\r\nwest, becoming large with the currents that join it by both margins.\r\nFrom this confluence, which is about seventy miles west of the town\r\nof St. Joao d’el Rey, the Rio Grande continues its course westward,\r\nincreasing much to the boundary of the province, where it begins to\r\nserve as a limit between the provinces of Goyaz and St. Paulo; it is\r\nstored with a variety of fish.\r\n\r\nThe Sapucahy flows from the serra Mantiqueira, has numerous windings,\r\nand is enlarged by many other rivers, the largest of which is the\r\nVerde, that rises near the source of the Rio Grande, and, after having\r\nwatered an extensive territory, pastured by large herds of cattle, runs\r\nnorth-west, and irrigates a similarly stocked and larger country in the\r\nprovince of St. Paulo, where it has its junction with the preceding.\r\n\r\nNear the margin, and not far from the origin of the Mozambo, a branch\r\nof the Sapucahy, there are several wells of sulphureous water, some\r\nwarmer than others, which have been found beneficial in certain\r\ndiseases; and between the plains of the river Verde and Baepondy, near\r\na rivulet which falls into the Verde, there are various mineral and\r\nvitriolic waters.\r\n\r\nIn this comarca originate the Pardo and Jaguary, which wash the\r\nnorthern part of the province of St. Paulo, the Paraupeba, Para,\r\nLambary, Bambuhy, and the St. Francisco, which receives them: these are\r\nthe principal rivers in the northern part.\r\n\r\nThe Camanducaya is a branch of the Sapucahy. The Jacuhy, Jacare, and\r\nCapivary are discharged into the Rio Grande, below the confluence of\r\nDas Mortes. The Peixe and the small Das Mortes enter the large Das\r\nMortes; the latter twenty miles below St. Joao d’el Rey, and the other\r\nstill further. The _doirado_, _mandin_, and _pracanjuba_\r\nare the best fish in those rivers.\r\n\r\nSt. Joao d’el Rey, antecedently Rio das Mortes, is the head town of\r\nthe comarca, and the residence of its ouvidor, who acts in other\r\nsituations, and is also crown judge. It is one of the largest, and the\r\nmost abundant places in the province, and is agreeably seated in a flat\r\ncountry, about two miles from the river that gave it the primitive name\r\ntill 1712, when John V. gave it the present name and the title of a\r\ntown. It has a church of the Lady of Pilar; two chapels dedicated to\r\nthe Lady of Dores and Mercez; one to St. Pedro; others to St. Antonio,\r\nSt. Caetano, St. Francisco, administered by the blacks; two Terceira\r\norders of the Lady of Carmo and St. Francisco. The chapel of the\r\nlatter is the finest in the whole province, and stands upon a large\r\n_praca_, or square. It has also an hospital, and two bridges of\r\nstone over the small channel of Tijuco, which divides the town into two\r\nportions; a Juiz de Fora, who is also head of the orphan establishment;\r\nan attorney general; a royal professor of Latin; a vicar-foraneo; and\r\na smelting-house, with the same appointments as that of Villa Rica,\r\nexcepting the _abridor dos cunhos_, (engraver of coins.) The\r\njudicial appointments are also the same.\r\n\r\nThis town has tolerably good houses, with paved streets. All the\r\nnecessaries of life of the country are cheap. There are here white\r\n_tangerina_ oranges, which are not met with in any other part. The\r\nroad, which leads to the Rio das Mortes, upon which there is another\r\nlarge bridge of wood, is bordered by _quintas_, or country houses.\r\nAbout the middle of this interval is the arraial of Matozinhos, with a\r\nchapel of Espirito Santo. In its suburbs are cultivated the cane, much\r\nIndian corn, some rye, a little mandioca, and cotton; and at a greater\r\ndistance cattle are bred. Mining is the general occupation.\r\n\r\nThere are twelve chapels in its extensive environs, generally provided\r\nwith chaplains, who are, with as many more coadjutors of the vicar,\r\nprivileged to administer the sacraments in his jurisdiction. This town\r\nis nearly eighty miles to the south-west of Villa Rica, about the same\r\ndistance south-south-west from Sabara, and upwards of two hundred\r\nnorth-west of Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nEight miles to the north-north-west of St. Joao d’el Rey, and near the\r\nright margin of the Rio das Mortes, is the middling town of St. Joze,\r\nwith the handsomest church in the province, dedicated to St. Antonio,\r\na chapel of the Lady Rozario, and another of St. Joao Evangelista: it\r\nabounds with the necessaries of life, and is provided with good water.\r\nThe inhabitants, and those of its wide district, who are well supplied\r\nwith Catholic places of worship, raise much Indian corn, some barley, a\r\ndiversity of fruits, cattle, and numerous herds of hogs, its principal\r\nriches. Some are miners.\r\n\r\nBarbacena is a middling town, having a beautiful aspect, well situated\r\nin the proximity of the serra Mantiqueira, and three miles from the Das\r\nMortes, with a church of the Lady of Piedade, a chapel of St. Francisco\r\nde Paula, two of the Lady of Rozario and Boa Morte. In its environs\r\nis the Brazilian pine; and the olive tree fructifies in some parts.\r\nThe inhabitants raise cattle, and cultivate the most substantial lands\r\nwith the most useful articles; some search for gold, and others are\r\noccupied in various branches of industry, with advantage to the place.\r\nIt is thirty-five miles east-south-east of St. Joao d’el Rey, and fifty\r\nsouth-south-west of Villa Rica.\r\n\r\nQuelluz, otherwise Carijos, is a town finely situated about thirty\r\nmiles south-south-west of Villa Rica, fifty north-east of St. Joao d’el\r\nRey, and three from the Congonhas, near the skirt of the serra of Oiro\r\nBranco. It has a church of Our Lady of Conceiçao, two hermitages of St.\r\nAntonio and Carmo. Cattle is the wealth of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nTamandua is a middling town between two small streams, which are\r\nbranches of the Lambary. It is well supplied with the provisions of\r\nthe country, and has a church of St. Bento, two chapels of Our Lady\r\nof Mercez and Rozario, another of St. Francisco de Paula, with a\r\nfraternity, whose brothers enjoy extraordinary privileges. It is nearly\r\nninety miles west of Villa Rica, fifty north-west of St. Joao d’el Rey,\r\nseventy south of Pitangui, and seventy west-north-west of Sabara. The\r\ninhabitants and those of its district are cattle breeders, farmers, and\r\nminers.\r\n\r\nCampanha, properly the town of Princeza da Beira, is in a state of\r\nmediocrity, situated in a plain twelve miles from the Verde, with a\r\nchurch of St. Antonio do Valle de Piedade, (St. Anthony of the Valley\r\nof Piety,) two chapels of the Lady of Rozario and Dores, one of St.\r\nSebastiao, and another of St. Francisco de Paula, with a brotherhood\r\nsubject to the town of Tamandua. It has a Juiz de Fora, who is head of\r\nthe orphans, a royal professor of Latin, and a vicar, and is nearly\r\neighty miles south-west of St. Joao d’el Rey, and one hundred and\r\nfifty south of Pitangui. The inhabitants and those of its environs are\r\nminers, farmers of rye, wheat, Indian corn, tobacco, some mandioca,\r\ncotton, and sugar, and raise many cattle and hogs. In some situations\r\nare cultivated flax; and generally coarse woollens and cottons are\r\nmanufactured.\r\n\r\nSt. Maria de Baepondy is yet a small town. The church is dedicated to\r\nOur Lady of Conceiçao, and the wealth of its inhabitants consists in\r\ntobacco, for which the soil is well adapted. It is fifty miles east of\r\nCampanha, and was created a town by a law of the 19th of July, 1814,\r\nwhen to its civil government were added two ordinary judges, one of\r\norphans, three magistrates, two regulators of the market, two public\r\nscriveners, judicial and notarial, the first filling also the offices\r\nof escrivao of the town house, excise, and market, the other the office\r\nof escrivao of the orphans; there is also an alcaide and his escrivao.\r\n\r\nSt. Carlos de Jacuhy is situated near the origin of the river which\r\nlends it the name, has a church of the Lady of Conceiçao, and was\r\ncreated a town by the same law as Baepondy, with the same civil\r\nofficers, to whom the parishioners of Cabo Verde became subject. It\r\nis near the boundary of the province of St. Paulo, and is abundant in\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nIn this comarca are the following parishes:--St. Anna de Sapocahy,\r\ntwenty-five miles from the river of the same name; the inhabitants\r\ncultivate legumes and are gold miners. Conceiçao de Camanducaya,\r\nfifteen to the right of the Jaguary; it exports hides. Carmo de Cabo\r\nVerde, near the river from which it takes the name; its parishioners\r\ncultivate cotton, some wheat, are miners, and export hides. St.\r\nAnna d’Itajuba, where wheat, rye, and Indian corn are cultivated.\r\nPouzo-Alegre, whose inhabitants are agriculturists. St. Pedro\r\nd’Alcantara Oiro Fino, where there are hot springs; it is fifty miles\r\nfrom the town of Bragança, and cattle and wheat are its productions.\r\nConceiçao das Laoras do Funil, sixty miles from St. Joao d’ el Rey;\r\nthe inhabitants are agriculturists. Conceiçao de Pouzo Alto, fifty\r\nmiles from the town of Campanha, where cotton and wheat are raised.\r\nConceiçao da Juruoca St. Gonçalo, formerly a large and flourishing\r\narraial, near twenty miles from Campanha; the inhabitants are miners\r\nand agriculturists.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Comarca of_ SABARA.\r\n\r\nThis comarca is bounded on the north by the province of Pernambuco;\r\non the west by that of Goyaz; on the south by the comarca of Rio das\r\nMortes; and on the east by that of Serro Frio. It is three hundred and\r\nfifty miles from north to south, and more than two hundred and ten from\r\neast to west. It is watered by many rivers, the whole tributary to the\r\nSt. Francisco, which traverses its southern part and separates it on\r\nthe north from the comarca of Serro Frio. It abounds in pasturage and\r\nlarge herds of cattle, and has mines of various metals, diamonds, and\r\nother precious stones. It produces Indian corn, mandioca, rice, sugar,\r\ntobacco, legumes, cotton, various fruits, and in many parts plenty of\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The serras of Marcella, Christaes, and Tabatinga, are\r\nthe most elevated portions of the cordillera which limit it on the\r\nwest. The serra of Jinipapo is in the vicinity of the confluence of\r\nthe river Velhas; the serras Quatys and Araras in the centre of the\r\nwestern part. The serra Negra separates it from the comarca of Rio\r\ndas Mortes for a considerable space, and is almost entirely of stone,\r\nhaving mines of good gold. The serra Lapa follows that of Oiro Preto\r\nto the north. The serra of Piedade extends nearly northward. Those of\r\nSaudade and Itucambira run north and south for a great extent, and at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the river Velhas, serving as limits between\r\nthis comarca and that of Serro Frio.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND LAKES.--The river St. Francisco, which is the largest of\r\nthe province, and receives a great part of its other rivers, rises in\r\nthe vicinity of the serra of Canastra. After flowing a considerable\r\nspace towards the north-east and gathering various small streams on\r\nboth sides, it receives on the left the Bambuhy, which flows from the\r\nboundary and brings with it the Perdiçao, that originates in the serra\r\nMarcella: this is the first considerable stream that enlarges the St.\r\nFrancisco. Twenty-eight miles lower it is joined on the right by the\r\nLambary, which waters the extensive district of the town of Tamandua;\r\nas much further to the north it receives on the left the Marmellada,\r\nthat flows from the serra Quatys. Eighteen miles lower the considerable\r\nriver Para is incorporated with it, after running more than one hundred\r\nand forty miles from the south-east and passing the town of Pitangui.\r\nThe Paraupeba follows, whose course is not less than two hundred and\r\nten miles, its origin being near the town of Quelluz. The country\r\nthrough which it flows abounds with cattle.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles below the confluence of the Paraupeba is that of\r\nthe Andaya, which comes from the boundary, running along an extensive\r\nand moderately elevated cordillera, (whose southern portion is called\r\nSaudade and the northern Quatys,) and bringing with it the Funchal.\r\nThis river, one hundred miles long, abounds with precious stones,\r\namongst which there are many diamonds.\r\n\r\nA little lower the Borrachuda, discharged also on the left, is not much\r\ninferior to the preceding, and runs like it along the western side of a\r\ncordillera called the serra Araras, which is parallel with the former.\r\n\r\nEighteen miles below, the considerable Abayte discharges itself on the\r\nsame side, and is formed by two streams of the same name, that unite\r\nmuch above its mouth, whose origins are more than one hundred miles\r\ndistant from each other; one comes from the south-west, the other from\r\nthe north-west, and brings the waters of the small river Chumbo, that\r\npasses the base of a morro where there is a rich mine of lead, from\r\nwhich it takes the name. The intervening territory of the origins of\r\nthe Abaytes is a wood, denominated the Matta da Corda, which invites\r\nthe agriculturist, having various intervals of campinhas, where\r\nnumerous herds of cattle graze, their owners living at a great distance.\r\n\r\nFifty miles further is the grand cataract of Pirapora, and fifteen\r\nbeyond it the confluence of the large river Das Velhas, (Old Women,)\r\noriginally Guaycuhy, which in the language of the aborigines signifies\r\nthe same, and whose origin is in the vicinity of St. Bartholomew,\r\nsix miles to the west of Villa Rica. It has a great number of falls,\r\nwindings, and more than two hundred miles of course. The Parauna, the\r\nPardo, and the Curmatahy, which unite with it on the right, and the\r\nBicudo on the left, are its largest tributaries.\r\n\r\nA little lower, the St. Francisco receives on the right the Jequetahy\r\nand the Pacuhy. Their adjacent lands are pastured by large cattle.\r\nFurther on, the large Paracatu enters it on the left, the principal\r\nheads of which are the Escuro and the Prata, incorporated with the\r\nArrependidos, which limits for some distance the two provinces. These\r\nrivers unite themselves a few leagues above the Corrego Rico, (Rich\r\nChannel) that passes near the town of Paracatu. Here it takes this\r\nname. Its largest tributary is the Preto, which issues from lake\r\nFeia, near the arraial of Coiros, in the province of Goyaz, and after\r\nhaving gathered a great number of small streams, joins the Paracatu\r\non the left, almost at an equal distance from the confluence where it\r\ntakes and that where it loses the name. A little below the Preto, on\r\nthe opposite side, the Paracatu receives the Sonno, rich in precious\r\nstones, which brings the waters of the Almas, that joins it on the\r\nleft. The Paracatu is navigable to a little below the Corrego Rico, and\r\nits crystalline waters are so light, that they float a considerable way\r\nabove those of the river which receives them. Its lateral lands are\r\nabundant in cattle.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles to the north, the St. Francisco receives, on the same\r\nside, the large Urucuya, navigable for a considerable distance. It\r\noriginates on the boundary of Goyaz, is narrow and deep, having clear\r\nwaters, which flow with such rapidity, that, on entering the St.\r\nFrancisco, they at all times roll across, sensibly affecting the lands\r\nof its eastern margin. The St. Rita, joining on the right, and the\r\nClaro on the left, are its principal tributaries, both traversing\r\nsterile lands possessing cattle.\r\n\r\nIt is followed by the Acary, Pardo, Pandeiro, Salgado, Pindahyba,\r\nItacaramby, and the Japore, the whole entering by the western margin.\r\nThe Pandeiro has fine water, an extensive course, and traverses large\r\nwoods of excellent timber with many cedars, where numerous colonies\r\nmight be advantageously established, for the cultivation of their\r\nfertile soils.\r\n\r\nA few leagues below the Japore, the important river Verde enters on\r\nthe eastern side; and about the same distance further, the Carinhenha,\r\nwhich is large and navigable for a considerable extent. It rises in\r\nthe chapadas of Santa Maria, near the limits of Goyaz; its crystalline\r\nwaters, having a rapid current, flow for a considerable way without\r\nmixing with those of the St. Francisco after entering it.\r\n\r\nWe will finish the description of the noble St. Francisco when we\r\ntreat upon the province of Pernambuco, which is bounded by this river\r\nfrom hence to the ocean. This very extensive river, as well as those\r\nmentioned which enlarge it, abound with fish, of which the _doirado_,\r\n_sorrubin_, _mandin_, and _piranha_, are the best.\r\n\r\nNear the right margin of the St. Francisco, and eighteen miles below\r\nthe confluence of the Bambuhy, is the lake Feia, of a circular form,\r\nabout three hundred yards in diameter, of dark green water, and\r\ninhabited by the _sucury_ and _sucuriu_ snakes, and the alligator. No\r\nreptile or even bird approaches to drink its waters. About two miles to\r\nthe north, there is another called Lake Verde, narrow, six miles long,\r\nand the haunt of the same horrible creatures. Both lakes are discharged\r\ninto the St. Francisco. The _sucuriu_ and _sucury_ differ only in\r\ncolour; the first is of a blackish hue, and the other grey: they have\r\ntwo large claws, or talons, near the extremity of the tail, with which\r\nthey secure themselves to roots or the points of stones under the\r\nwater, when they wish to seize any animal. The teeth are sharp pointed,\r\nand inclined towards the gorge, so that the prisoner cannot escape,\r\nalthough the monster wished to withdraw its hold. _Sucurys_ have been\r\nkilled twenty yards long. These snakes are supposed to be a species of\r\nthe _sucuriuba_ of other provinces.\r\n\r\nVilla Real do Sabara, (Royal Town of Sabara) is the head of the\r\ncomarca, and ordinary residence of its ouvidor, who also acts in other\r\nsituations. It stands near the right margin of the Velhas, where this\r\nriver receives the small stream that affords the town’s name, in a\r\nlow situation, surrounded with mountains, and is large, flourishing,\r\nwell supplied with meat, fish, and the common necessaries peculiar\r\nto the country. It has a church of the Lady of Conceiçao, a chapel\r\nof Our Lady of O, another of Rozario, and a numerous fraternity of\r\nblacks, two Terceira orders of Carmo and St. Francisco. There is a\r\nJuiz de Fora, who is head of the orphan establishment; a vicar; the\r\nusual professors of the first letters and Latin; and a smelting house\r\nfor gold, the expenses of which are forty thousand crusades annually,\r\nhaving the same appointments as that of Villa Rica, with the exception\r\nof the engraver of stamps for coining, and the third founder. This\r\ntown has a good fountain of excellent water in the street of Caquende,\r\nand four entrances from the cardinal points, all but one having wooden\r\nbridges; the eastern and southern are over the Sabara. The judicial\r\nofficers are the same here as in the capital of the province; the\r\nannual revenue of the camara, or municipal body, is nine thousand\r\ncrusades. The heat is here more intense in the hot months than in\r\nany other povoaçao in the province, arising, most probably, from its\r\nreflexion from the circumjacent mountains. A register for receiving\r\nthe royal duties was, in 1712, established in this place, which is\r\nthirty-five miles north-north-west of Marianna, seventy north-east\r\nof Tamandua, near one hundred south-west of Villa do Principe, and\r\nseventy-five north-north-east of St. Joao d’ el Rey. The inhabitants,\r\nand those of six parishes within its district, (viz. Rio das Pedras,\r\nSt. Antonio, Curral d’ el Rey, St. Luzia, Congonhas, and Rapozos,)\r\ncomprising altogether forty-six thousand three hundred persons, are\r\nminers and farmers, and form two regiments of cavalry, one with eleven,\r\nand the other with eight companies, all whites; twenty companies of\r\ninfantry; a regiment of eleven companies of mulattoes; and another of\r\nseven companies of _forro_, or free blacks. In the year 1788,\r\nthe population of Sabara consisted of seven thousand six hundred and\r\nfifty-six persons, and eight hundred and fifty houses. In 1819, its\r\ninhabitants did not exceed nine thousand three hundred and forty-seven.\r\n\r\nThis comarca, which is nearly as large as England, does not, exclusive\r\nof the district of Paracatu, contain more than one hundred and thirteen\r\nthousand, three hundred and sixty-four souls. Senhor Gama, who was\r\nrecently its ouvidor or governor, collected materials, during his\r\ntriennial government, for a map of the comarca, which he presented\r\nto the minister of state at Rio de Janeiro, in expectation that his\r\nlabours would at least have received some approbation; but the subject\r\nwas treated with indifference. Senhor Gama subsequently made me a\r\npresent of the map, an exact copy of which is here introduced. The\r\nsignal of a standard upon the map points out those places rich in\r\ndiamonds, which, by a strange policy, are rigidly preserved untouched\r\nas a resource for the government; and whenever they are worked, if\r\nthe proceedings are conducted upon the same principle as the diamond\r\ngrounds of Tijuco, will certainly not be a source of much revenue to\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Mapa da Comarca do_\r\n\r\n  SABARA.]\r\n\r\nSenhor Gama related a circumstance which occurred during his\r\nouvidorship here, that affords a tolerably strong evidence of the\r\ndeep subtilty practised by some, at least, of the Brazilian holy\r\nfathers, for their personal benefit. A female, residing at no great\r\ndistance from Sabara, whose mind was darkened by bigotry, and who was\r\nparticularly rigid in all religious observances, no saint day passing\r\nwithout her exhibiting the utmost devotion, mortified herself in a\r\npeculiar degree on all occasions of fasting, and during Lent always\r\nrefrained from eating, with such resolution, that she acquired the\r\nhonour of being considered a saint. So strongly was her mind influenced\r\nby this delusion, that she communicated her self-working inspirations\r\nto two or three padres, who lived near. They immediately inflamed her\r\nwild imagination by their countenance, and gave public weight to the\r\nnotion, by affirming that her soul would ascend to heaven on a certain\r\nday. Contributions were already talked of for forming an establishment\r\nto be dedicated to Santa Harmonica, the name of the female. The priests\r\nwere, of course, to have the administration of the funds. Good Friday\r\nwas the appointed day for the consummation of this important event.\r\nThe machinery hitherto worked well, and her exhausted appearance,\r\nfrom continued fasting, warranted the conclusion that her dissolution\r\nwas near. It was a subject of general interest, and being introduced\r\nwhere the ouvidor was present on the evening preceding the intended\r\nconclusion of the drama, he stated that he had not faith in any thing\r\nso ridiculous; and in the event of the female’s death, he would summon\r\na species of inquest to be held upon the body. A friend or coadjutor of\r\nthe priests was present: he left the party and hastened on horseback to\r\ncommunicate this determination of the ouvidor to the holy brothers. An\r\neffect very contrary to the expectation of her devoted worshippers was\r\nthus produced. She speedily recovered from her saintly indisposition,\r\nand remains, if not in mental, at least in bodily health to this day.\r\nIt was ascertained to have been the intention of these priests, founded\r\non the wicked purpose of deriving advantages from the contemplated\r\nestablishment of Santa Harmonica, to have produced, by some means, a\r\ngradual exhaustion of life by the appointed time.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve miles from Sabara there is a lake, two miles long and\r\nnearly one in width, whose crystalline and tepid waters, having been\r\nan antidote in many diseases, acquired it the name of the Holy Lake.\r\nIn its centre there are various springs; and when not agitated, its\r\nsurface is covered with a pellicle or thin skin of the colour of\r\nmercury, which disappears by blowing upon it, and leaves the lips\r\nsilvered over of those who drink it. It is discharged at the northern\r\nextremity by an outlet into the river Velhas, which is five miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles north of Sabara, and a mile from the Velhas, is the large\r\nand flourishing freguezia or parish of Santa Luzia, ornamented with\r\nfive Catholic temples, and whose inhabitants, amounting to thirteen\r\nthousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, are well supplied with its\r\nproduce of agriculture, mines, and cattle.\r\n\r\nVilla Nova da Raynha, created a town in 1714, but better known by its\r\nprimitive name of Caethe, which in the Brazilian language signifies an\r\nimpervious wood, is a middling place, well and agreeably situated in\r\nplain ground, near a small stream, ornamented with a handsome church\r\ndedicated to the Lord of Bom Successo, a chapel of the Lady of Rozario,\r\nand another of St. Francisco. There are fifteen judicial appointments\r\nhere. The revenue of the camara is eight thousand crusades. The\r\ninhabitants, amounting to five thousand two hundred and seventy-one,\r\nare miners, breeders of cattle, and agriculturists; they respire a\r\nsalubrious air, raise various European fruits, and form, with the three\r\nparishes of St. Miguel, St. Barbara, and St. Joao de Morro Grande,\r\ncontaining twenty-nine thousand inhabitants, seventeen companies of\r\nwhite militia, seven of mulattoes, and some squadrons of free blacks.\r\nIt is twelve miles east-south-east of Sabara, and has in its suburbs\r\ngood argils and potteries.\r\n\r\nPitangui is in a state of mediocrity, upon the right margin of the\r\nPara, three miles below the confluence of the St. Joao, and is well\r\nsupplied with fish, meat, and all the agricultural productions of\r\nthe country. It was erected into a town in 1715, has two hermitages,\r\nand a church of the Lady of Pilar; a Juiz de Fora, and an escrivao\r\nof the conductors of gold. The camara has three thousand crusades\r\nof revenue. This town is one hundred miles north of St. Joao d’el\r\nRey, and nearly eighty west-north-west of Sabara. Its inhabitants,\r\namounting to nineteen thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and those\r\nof its widely extending district, (including only one other parish,\r\nNossa Senhora das Dores, with one thousand four hundred and nineteen\r\npersons,) raise large quantities of cattle, horses, hogs, and sheep,\r\nand have extensive plantations of the cotton tree and cane, the rum\r\nfrom which is considered the best of the province. A rich mine of gold\r\noccasioned numerous disputes and deaths amongst its first dwellers,\r\nwho were Paulista miners. There was amongst them one D. R. do Prado,\r\nwho gratified his vile and avaricious feelings, by assassinating even\r\nthose who did not offend him; such was the lawless state in which those\r\nprimitive mining settlements were involved.\r\n\r\nParacatu do Principe is a middling town, famous for its mines, well and\r\npleasantly situated upon an elevated plain, with straight and paved\r\nstreets, having a church dedicated to St. Antonio da Manga, three\r\nhermitages of Our Lady of Abbadia, Amparo, and Rozario, another of\r\nSt. Anna, and two good fountains. The houses are built of timber and\r\nearth, and include a royal school for Latin. This town is one hundred\r\nand forty miles from the St. Francisco, and about half a mile from the\r\nsmall stream of Corgo Rica, which after forty miles of course enters\r\nthe Paracatu on the left, near the port of Bezerra. It has decayed much\r\nfrom its first flourishing condition; the people are peaceable, but\r\nindolent. Cattle and the produce of mines constitutes what wealth there\r\nis amongst them. The vine bears fruit in perfection twice a year. The\r\npine-apple and orange are abundant and excellent. Around this place\r\nare an abundance of partridges, deer, and other game. The gold has a\r\nfine appearance, but below the proper degree of purity is of difficult\r\nextraction for want of water, and is not allowed to be searched for\r\nat any great distance. Diamonds having appeared in various parts is\r\nthe reason of the working of mines being restricted to a few leagues\r\nround the town, upon which circuit are detachments to prevent the\r\nprescribed limits being passed for the purpose of mining. The district\r\nof the town comprises the main portion of the comarca, that is to say,\r\nall the territory lying westward of the river St. Francisco, from the\r\nCarynhenha to the Abayte. Near the confluence of the latter is the\r\npassage from Villa Rica to Goyaz, called Porto Real.\r\n\r\nIn 1744, when there was no other colony to the west of the St.\r\nFrancisco but St. Romao, these mines were discovered, and made known\r\nto Gomez Freyre d’Andrade, governor of Rio de Janeiro, who ordered the\r\ncountry to be divided according to the prevailing custom. These mines\r\nattracted a great concourse of people here, and their affluence in gold\r\nled to the concurrence of a numerous party in the purpose of expelling\r\nthe Indians, whom they at once drove from this extensive district. The\r\ninhabitants of Paracatu, and those of the parishes of its vast circuit,\r\nconstitute one regiment of cavalry, seven companies of whites, three of\r\nmulattoes, and two of free blacks.\r\n\r\nOn the left margin of the river St. Francisco, almost at an equal\r\ndistance between the mouths of the Urucuya and Paracatu, is the\r\nconsiderable arraial and parish of St. Romao, with a church dedicated\r\nto St. Antonio da Manga, a chapel of Our Lady of Rozario, and another\r\nof St. Francisco. It is the head of the julgado, with much commerce,\r\nbeing the depositary of various productions of the country, and of a\r\nlarge quantity of salt, which is conveyed by barks and canoes from the\r\nsalterns of Pilao Arcado and its vicinity. The river at its greatest\r\nfloods enters the streets of this place. Its inhabitants, even the\r\nfemales, are passionately fond of gambling. Melons and water-melons are\r\nvery abundant.\r\n\r\nThe other parishes of the district of Paracatu are St. Anna dos\r\nAlegres, near the mouth of the river Catinga, a little above the river\r\nSomno; the Lady of Penha, near the Urucuya, a day’s voyage from the\r\nSt. Francisco; Carynhenha, Andayha, and the Lady of Amparo do Salgado,\r\nwith a chapel of Our Lady of Rozario, which is a flourishing arraial,\r\nand promising a considerable increase. It is five miles from the St.\r\nFrancisco. The inhabitants raise cattle, sugar cane, and the cotton\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe district of Paracatu makes a part of the bishopric of Pernambuco.\r\n\r\nThere is yet within this comarca the arraial and julgado of St. Antonio\r\ndo Curvello, otherwise Papagayo, well situated in a plain, refreshed\r\nwith salubrious breezes, and near a small stream, which falls into\r\nthe Velhas on the left. This is almost eighty miles from Sabara. The\r\ninhabitants of the julgado, amounting to eleven thousand five hundred\r\nand thirteen, are agriculturists and cattle breeders.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1815, the comarca of Sabara was divided into two, the St.\r\nFrancisco serving as a medium limit to them. The northern, western,\r\nand southern limits of the new comarca are the same which till then\r\nconstituted the circuit of the district of Paracatu, the head and\r\nonly town of the newly created comarca, which took its name. At the\r\nsame time was abolished the office of the Juiz de Fora, which had\r\nexisted since it was created a town in 1798, the new ouvidor becoming\r\nthe intendant of gold. By another law of the 4th of April, 1816, the\r\njulgados of Desemboque and Araxa were separated from the ouvidoria or\r\ndistrict of Goyaz, and annexed to the ouvidoria of Paracatu.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Comarca of_ SERRO FRIO.\r\n\r\nThe comarca of Serro Frio takes its name from a mountain, which of\r\nall others is the most celebrated for the riches which it contains.\r\nIt is limited on the north by the province of Bahia, which also with\r\nthat of Porto Seguro confines it on the east; on the south by the\r\ncomarca of Villa Rica; and on the west by that of Sabara. It comprises\r\nnearly three hundred miles from north to south, and one hundred and\r\neighty from east to west. The country is for the greater part very\r\nmountainous, and watered by numerous rivers, with extensive charnecas,\r\nor sterile lands, in the northern part, which only serve for the\r\nbreeding of cattle. There are, however, generally portions of land,\r\nmore or less considerable, appropriated to the culture of cotton,\r\nIndian corn, rice, mandioca, legumes, tobacco, some rye, and sugar. It\r\nis the richest in precious stones; and has mines of all the metals.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--There is a grand cordillera, (a continuation of the\r\nMantiqueira,) which does not always retain the same name, altitude, or\r\ndirection, breaking in many parts, and stretching out various arms at\r\ndivers points, traversing the comarca almost north and south. In the\r\neastern part there is the serra of Esmeraldas; the serra Branca, which\r\nseparates the comarca from that of Sabara for a considerable space, and\r\nafterwards inclines to the north-east to the limit of the province; the\r\nserra of Gram Mogol; that of Peixe Brabo; of Gurutuba, of Conceiçao,\r\nand of Almas.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The principal are the Jequitinhonha, the Verde, the Pardo, the\r\nMucury, the Arassuahy, the Sassuhy, the Corrente, and the St. Antonio.\r\n\r\nThe Jequitinhonha, so celebrated for the prodigious quantity of\r\ndiamonds that has been drawn from its bed, rises in the serra of Serro\r\nFrio. After having described many windings, and watered an extensive\r\ncountry, it receives on the left the Itucambyrussu, which flows from\r\nthe west, and traverses the serra of Gram Mogol. Having run for a\r\nconsiderable space, and inclining to the east, its waters are increased\r\nby the Vaccaria, which enters on the same side, and descends also from\r\nthe serra of Gram Mogol, traversing _certams_[24] pastured by cattle.\r\nA few leagues below it is joined on the right by the Arassuahy, which\r\nis superior, and originates also in the Serro Frio, a little to the\r\neast of it, and brings the waters of the St. Antonio, the Itamarandiba,\r\nand the Setuval, with others smaller, whose heads are on the northern\r\nside of the serra Esmeraldas. Some leagues below the confluence of the\r\nArassuahy, the Piauhy enters, coming from the south-west, through woods\r\nabounding with game that affords food to the savages. This river and\r\nits confluents abound with chrysolites, sapphires, crystals, _pingos\r\nd’agua_, and other precious stones. The Jequitinhonha gathers on the\r\nleft the Hottinga, on the right the St. Java, and leaving the province\r\nflows north-east, forming a boundary to the ocean between the provinces\r\nof Porto Seguro and Bahia, where it is discharged under the name of the\r\nBelmonte. All these rivers are stored with the fish called _doirado_,\r\n_piampara_, _piau_, _piabanha_, _trahira_, _sorubin_, and _mandin_,\r\ncalled also _roncadore_.\r\n\r\nThe river Verde is large and flows through extensive certams abounding\r\nwith cattle, which forms the wealth of many farmers, who live\r\ndispersed, principally in the vicinity of the southern portion of the\r\nserra of Gram Mogol. After a considerable course to the north, it\r\nreceives on the right the Guaratuba, which originates near the northern\r\nportion of the last mentioned serra, and brings with it the Pacuhy,\r\nthat issues from the serra Pranca, and joins it on the eastern side.\r\nTen miles below the mouth of the Guaratuba, the Verde Pequeno (small)\r\nenters, which flows from the Morro da Chapeo, a portion of the serra\r\nAlmas, taking a westerly course, and forming the northern division\r\nof the province. At this part the Verde runs with little variation\r\nto the west, and continues in the same direction till it joins the\r\nSt. Francisco. These rivers water sterile districts, which will never\r\nbecome populous.\r\n\r\nThe Pardo forms itself in the vicinity of the serra Almas, runs\r\nsouth-east, gathering the Preto, which has its source in the serra\r\nBranca, inclines to the east, and enters the comarca of Ilheos, where\r\nit is discharged into the ocean by the name of Patype.\r\n\r\nThe Mucury, whose principal head springs to the south of the serra\r\nEsmeraldas, after receiving by the left margin the large and small\r\nPreto, and lower, the Todos os Santos on the right, enters the province\r\nof Porto Seguro, where it increases, and falls into the ocean. The\r\nterritory which this river passes, (before leaving the comarca,)\r\nand its said tributaries, was formerly possessed by the _Macuni_,\r\n_Panhame_, _Capocho_, and _Machacary_ Indians. At the present day the\r\nferocious _Aimbores_ are its wandering inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe first river Preto, about ten miles above its mouth, gathers on\r\nthe left the small stream of Americanas, formed by three rivulets\r\nissuing from the same serra. Near the central one was found in 1811, a\r\nbeautiful _aqua-marina_, of more than fifteen pounds weight, and\r\nanother of four pounds. The Sassuhy, the Corrente, and the St. Antonio,\r\nare tributaries of the river Doce, and flow through the most southern\r\npart of the comarca.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Jas. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  AN OFFICER OF CAVALRY IN MINAS GERAES, AND A HERMIT.]\r\n\r\nVilla do Principe, the head of the comarca, and residence of its\r\nouvidor, (who fills other offices,) is considerable, well supplied,\r\nand possesses a church of the Lady of Conceiçao, a chapel of the Lord\r\nof Matozinhos, another of St. Rita, three of the Lady of Purificaçao,\r\nCarmo, and Rozario. It is ill situated, has only one good street,\r\nand was erected into a town in the year 1714. It has a Juiz de Fora,\r\na royal professor of Latin, and a smelting house for gold, with the\r\nsame appointments as that of Sabara. This town is in the vicinity of\r\nthe serra Lapa, two miles distant from the river Peixe, (a branch of\r\nthe St. Antonio,) near one hundred north-east of Sabara, one hundred\r\nand ten north-north-east of Marianna, and three hundred and seventy\r\nalmost north-west of Rio de Janeiro. The inhabitants are miners, and\r\ncultivators of Indian corn, legumes, cotton, and sugar; the whites\r\nconstitute twenty-two companies of infantry, the mulattoes thirteen,\r\nand the free blacks six. The revenue of the vicarship amounts to twelve\r\nthousand crusades, and that of the camara to seven. In the whole of the\r\ncomarca there are two regiments of cavalry, one of eight, and the other\r\nof nine companies.\r\n\r\nWithin the district of the last town, and at a distance of forty miles,\r\nis the large arraial and parish of Conceiçao, in whose environs is the\r\nserra of Gaspar Soares, abundant in iron mines, for the working of\r\nwhich a royal establishment is forming.\r\n\r\nBom Successo, better known by the name of Fanado, created a town in\r\n1751, is well situated on elevated land, enjoying a fine climate,\r\nbetween two small streams that afford it the name, and uniting, enter\r\nthe Arassuahy, which passes six miles distant to the north. It has a\r\nchurch dedicated to the “Chief of the Apostles,” chapels of the Lord\r\nof Bom Fim, of the Lady of Amparo, for the mulattoes, of Rozario, for\r\nthe blacks, St. Anna, St. Joze, and St. Gonçalo; and a Terceira order\r\nof St. Francisco. It possesses a Juiz de Fora, and a royal professor\r\nof Latin. It has not one house of stone. The inhabitants follow the\r\nsame occupations as those of the last town, and some work for precious\r\nstones. The general traders are the most independent. This place is two\r\nhundred and twenty miles north-east of Marianna, two hundred and ten,\r\nnearly in the same direction, from Sabara, one hundred and twenty-five\r\nnorth-north-east of Villa do Principe, and four hundred and fifty from\r\nRio de Janeiro. In its extensive circuit there are various hermitages,\r\nnamely, Piedade, Mercez, Penha, St. Joao, Prata, and Barreiras. Their\r\nnumbers are expected to increase to the east and south as far as the\r\nriver Doce, when the projected roads to the ports of Porto Seguro are\r\nmade and frequented. The fertility of the territory, and the facility\r\nwhich proper measures may create for transporting produce to the ports,\r\nwill most probably attract numerous colonies to this district, which,\r\nunquestionably, will become the best in the province, when the Aimbore\r\nIndians are subjugated.\r\n\r\nTen miles to the north of Bom Successo is the parish of St. Cruz da\r\nChapada, near the river Capibary. The inhabitants scarcely raise any of\r\nthe necessaries of life, but follow mining.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles to the north-east of the preceding, and twenty-five from\r\nBom Successo, is the arraial of Agua Suja, (Dirty Water,) near the\r\nconfluence of the stream of its name, with the Arassuahy, having a\r\nchurch dedicated to the Lady of Conceiçao. The inhabitants cultivate\r\nIndian corn, legumes, and cotton, and are gold miners. In its district\r\nare the parishes of St. Domingos, and Conceiçao, near the Sucuriu,\r\nwhose parishioners raise the same articles, and work for gold and\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\nOne hundred miles north of Bom Successo is the considerable arraial of\r\nRio Pardo, at the confluence of the river from which it takes the name\r\nwith the Preto, each having a bridge. The houses are in great part of\r\nadobe, and the church of taipa. Its inhabitants raise cattle, mandioca,\r\nIndian corn, rice, cotton, and a variety of fruits.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and ten miles north of Sabara, one hundred and thirty\r\nwest-north-west of Bom Successo, and one hundred and fifty\r\nnorth-north-west of Villa do Principe, is the famous arraial and\r\njulgado of Barra do Rio das Velhas, situated in a plain at the\r\nconfluence of the river of its name, from whose floods it sustains\r\nconsiderable injury. It has a church of Bom Successo, and a chapel of\r\nLord Jesus of Matozinhos, has much commerce, is well supplied with\r\nmeat, fish, and fruit, and is the depositary of a large quantity of\r\nsalt that arrives from the salterns of the river St. Francisco. Fevers,\r\nwhich reign here in the wet season, have driven away many inhabitants,\r\nand prevent this place from becoming one of the largest povoaçoes in\r\nthe province. This arraial, that of Bom Successo, and others of the\r\ncomarca, belong to the archbishopric of Bahia.\r\n\r\nTwo miles distant is the arraial of Porteira, with a chapel of the Lady\r\nof Bom Successo and Rozario. In it reside the vicar, and the officers\r\nof justice, in consequence of being a healthy situation.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles further to the north, upon the margin of the St.\r\nFrancisco, is the small and agreeably situated arraial of Estrema,\r\nwith a hermitage of Conceiçao. It abounds with fish and meat. The fruit\r\nconsists principally of oranges.\r\n\r\nWithin this comarca is the mountainous diamond district, fifty miles in\r\ndiameter. The beautiful stones found here by Bernardo da Fonseca Lobo,\r\nin 1730, on being discovered to be diamonds, afforded this part of the\r\ncomarca its designation. The value of these stones not being at first\r\nknown, the district remained free till 1734, when an ouvidor of the\r\nprovince, who had resided at Goa, and had there acquired a knowledge\r\nof this most precious article, coming from Golconda, pronounced them\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nJ. F. d’Oliveira and F. F. da Sylva had the diamond contract in 1741,\r\nfor three years, at the sum of nine hundred thousand crusades. By a\r\nletter of the 3d of April, 1743, the king ordered the provedor of the\r\ntreasury of Villa Rica to superintend the diamond contract, with a\r\nsum not to exceed two hundred thousand crusades per annum. Some time\r\nhaving passed, the contract was publicly sold to some persons of the\r\nname of Caldeyras, who, in their operations, met with copious and rich\r\nsupplies. The opulence thus acquired, led them to perpetrate crimes for\r\nwhich they were sent to Limoeiro, where they ended their days, their\r\nproperty being confiscated by the crown. This contract was granted\r\nanew, to J. F. d’Oliveira, with whom it remained till the end of 1771.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1772, the diamond district came under the\r\nimmediate management of the government. But diamonds alone do not\r\nconstitute the riches and celebrity of this district; other precious\r\nstones concur in rendering it important, such as sapphires, emeralds,\r\naqua-marinas, chrysolites, topazes, &c. All these stones are produced\r\nin the serras, from whence they descend to the rivers, with the waters\r\nof the copious thunder showers. This district also possesses mines of\r\nall the metals, the extraction of which is rigorously prohibited on\r\naccount of the diamonds.\r\n\r\nAround the diamond district there are various military detachments, to\r\nprevent the plunder of those stones, or of gold; and also to exact the\r\nduties paid upon entrance. Amongst those stations may be enumerated,\r\nfirst, Milho Verde; and, next in rotation, Pirahuna, Gouvea, Rio Pardo,\r\nChapada, Arraial, Hinhahy, Rio Manço. The diamond demarcation, afar\r\noff exhibits a black perspective, swelling into a thousand rugged and\r\nuneven serras; on one hand are elevated mountains of one single stone,\r\ncut by nature into precipices that raise their heads to the clouds;\r\non the other, are extended serras, composed of detached rocks and\r\nstones, accumulated on each other in chaotic piles, covered with a\r\ngrey moss, and sparingly dressed in creeping brushwood. A thousand\r\npure and crystalline rills warble across its rude tracts formed by\r\nthe miner, and roll into his _gamella_[25] their rich offerings.\r\nThe waters of some are dashed over the sides of mountains, others\r\ndescend divided between broken rocks to the base of the serras, from\r\nwhence, accumulating, they flow in serpentine courses in search of\r\nlarger rivers, running sometimes tamely and tranquilly between spacious\r\nbanks; at others, precipitated amongst approximating and steep serras,\r\nwith loud and interesting murmurs. For a time they often disappear\r\naltogether from the sight, are again visible, flowing on in foaming\r\nfury. The crystallizations of diamonds are obtained near the surface\r\nof the earth. Their form is triangular, round, pointed on one side,\r\nwith the face always smooth; this proves that the crystallization is\r\ndispersed and solitary.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the diamond district, one hundred and thirty miles\r\nnorth-north-east of Marianna, one hundred and ten from Sabara, one\r\nhundred south-west of Bom Successo, and twenty-eight north-north-west\r\nof Villa do Principe, in a broken part of Serro Frio, to the west, and\r\nnot far from the river Jequitinhonha, is the flourishing arraial of St.\r\nAntonio do Tijuco, situated upon an amphitheatre, with a church of St.\r\nAntonio, which has the brotherhoods of S.S., of Pasos, and of the Lady\r\nof Terco, a chapel of the Lord of Bom Fim, with a fraternity of black\r\ncreoles; four of the Lady of Amparo, with a brotherhood of mulattoes;\r\nof Carmo, with a Terceira order; of Rozario, with a fraternity of\r\nAfrican blacks; and Mercez; another of St. Francisco, handsome, and\r\nwith a Terceira order; a recolhimento of Donzellas, or Virgins, with\r\ntheir little chapel, dedicated to the Lady of Luz; and a house of\r\nmisericordia, whose chapel is called St. Isabel. It has quarters for\r\ntroops, abounds with excellent water, and is rendered particularly\r\nwholesome by salubrious mountain breezes. The buildings are generally\r\nof taipa, few being of stone.\r\n\r\nHere reside the tribunal, or diamond junta, composed of five deputies,\r\nnamely, a _disembargador intendente_, (the intendant judge, or\r\ngovernor,) who is the president, with an exclusive jurisdiction in\r\nthe diamond demarcation, and a salary of eight thousand crusades per\r\nannum, besides other very considerable emoluments; _um corregedor\r\nfiscal_, (a civil magistrate,) with 5000 crusades; _um primeiro\r\ncaixa_, (a first book or chest keeper,) with 8000; _um segundo\r\ncaixa_, (a second book or chest keeper,) with 6000; _um inspector\r\ngeral_, (an inspector general,) with 4000.\r\n\r\nThere is an _escrivao_, or accountant of diamonds; and a\r\n_merinho_, or officer, for apprehending persons.

XIII.\r\n\r\n                      PROVINCE OF ESPIRITO SANTO.\r\n\r\n   _Extent--Boundaries--Misfortunes of its Donatories--Spirited\r\n   Resistance of the Indians--Partial Cultivation--Principally\r\n   possessed by Indians--Mountains--Mineralogy--Zoology--Descents\r\n   of Indians to the Coast--Phytology--Rivers and Ports--Povoações\r\n   --Island of Ascension._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis province comprehends three-fourths of the capitania of the\r\nsame name, given in the year 1534 to Vasco Fernandez Coutinho, as a\r\nremuneration for the services he had rendered in Asia to the Portuguese\r\ncrown. It extends one hundred and thirty miles from south to north,\r\nbetween the river Cabapuana and the river Doce, its northern limit; the\r\nwidth from east to west hitherto remains, in great part, undetermined,\r\nin consequence of a considerable portion of this territory yet\r\nremaining in the power of the aboriginal natives. It is bounded on the\r\nnorth by the province of Porto Seguro, on the west by that of Minas\r\nGeraes, on the south by that of Rio de Janeiro, and on the east by the\r\nAtlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nAuthentic documents, as to the precise epoch of its colonization, are\r\nnot discovered; the foundation of the town of Espirito Santo, and from\r\nwhich the capitania derived its name, may however be regarded as its\r\ncommencement. This town (now called Villa Velha, or Old Town,) was the\r\ncapital until Victoria acquired the pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted, by the author of the Geographical Description of\r\nPortuguese America, that Coutinho only took sixty persons with him to\r\nform the first establishment in his capitania, in which number were\r\nincluded two _degradados_, or degraded fidalgos, Don Gorge de\r\nMenezes and Don Simao de Castello Branco. With this small number he\r\nengaged and put the Indians to flight; founded the primitive capital;\r\nconstructed a fort; and established an engenho.\r\n\r\nAnimated with a desire of affording his colony the means of a rapid\r\nimprovement, he returned to Portugal, to procure what appeared to him\r\nrequisite for the accomplishment of this praiseworthy object, leaving\r\nin his stead Gorge de Menezes, who was killed in combat with the\r\nnatives. Castello Branco succeeded him in the government, and the\r\nGoytacaze tribe, having formed a confederacy with the Tupininquins,\r\nthey attacked the colony under his temporary jurisdiction with so much\r\nfury and effect as to destroy every edifice and to counteract all the\r\nefforts of the Portuguese to retain the footing they had made, so that\r\nthe remains of the colony, finding that the Indians gave no quarter to\r\nany individual, were compelled to seek refuge upon the margins of the\r\nriver Cricare.\r\n\r\nCoutinho returned from Portugal soon after this event, with all the\r\nassistance he could collect, and finding his capitania deserted, he\r\nsolicited succours from Mendo de Sa, the governor-general at Bahia,\r\nwhich were promptly despatched under the command of his excellency’s\r\nson, Fernando de Sa, who uniting his force to the fugitives, near\r\nthe Cricare, an assault was made upon the Indians with considerable\r\nadvantage, but a body of the enemy fell upon them in turn, and did not\r\nallow time for the whole to save themselves by flight to the ships;\r\nFernando de Sa, the commander was amongst the number that perished.\r\n\r\nUltimately, sixty-eight Europeans, the remains of so many people\r\nwho had in the course of thirty years repaired to this capitania to\r\nestablish themselves, attacked the Indians with desperate bravery,\r\nand gained a complete victory. This fortunate circumstance, aided by\r\nthe religious instruction with which the Jesuits enlightened and made\r\nfriends of a considerable portion of those savages, who served to\r\nreinforce the small number of whites, enabled the donatory to restore\r\nthe capitania to the state in which he had left it.\r\n\r\nThe padre, Affonso Braz, who founded the college of the town of\r\nVictoria, in 1551, was the first missionary who arrived in this\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe Indians did not supply the want of Europeans, who were prevented\r\nfrom coming here by hearing of the calamities of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nReverses of fortune reduced Coutinho to a state which precluded all\r\npossibility of deriving any advantage from the capitania; and one\r\nof his descendants, being equally unfortunate, sold it, for forty\r\nthousand crusades, to Francisco Gil d’Araujo, who established himself\r\nin it, animated with various projects, but which he soon abandoned in\r\ndespair. One of his heirs, after using every endeavour, relinquished\r\nit under similar circumstances, and sold it to the crown in the reign\r\nof John V. for the sum which it cost. This province cannot be said to\r\nhave experienced any considerable amelioration since the period of its\r\nreversion to the crown, nor does the dominion of the Indians reach to\r\na much less extensive tract of territory, which may be attributed to\r\nthe present scanty population, and the want of energy on the part of\r\nthe government; it may however be observed, that the reduction of the\r\nIndians is rendered more difficult by the numerous serras and extensive\r\nwoods which cover this district, demonstrating at the same time the\r\nfertility of the soil and its susceptibility of numerous branches of\r\nagriculture. The river Doce, which bounds it on the north, would render\r\nit still more valuable from the communication which might be opened\r\nby water from the mining districts to the ocean; and there is little\r\ndoubt but that part of this district, in the power of the Indians,\r\nthrough which it runs is auriferous; at least it is fair to draw such\r\nan inference from the pieces of gold which are in the possession of the\r\nIndians who come in contact with the Portuguese parties of soldiers\r\nstationed upon its banks. An ouvidor assured me that the captain-mors,\r\nwho commanded advanced stations upon this river, had seen pieces of\r\ngold in the possession of the Indians which they did not appear to\r\nvalue, but willingly exchanged them, at favourable opportunities, for\r\nknives or other iron instruments.\r\n\r\nThe salubrity of the climate, the existing state of this province, and\r\nthe advantages which it presents, loudly call upon the present king\r\nand government to adopt measures for clearing the margins of the river\r\nDoce of the tribes of Indians that infest it, and to render this river\r\nnavigable from the ocean to the province of Minas Geraes. The only\r\nnatural difficulties of the river which present any impediment to its\r\nfree navigation are the Escadinha falls, met with in its course between\r\nthe latter province and that of Porto Seguro; they are three in number,\r\nare highly interesting, and do not extend more than three miles, being\r\nnearly together, so that the construction of a railway, or any other\r\nand less excellent expedient which the government might be induced to\r\nadopt, for the space only of three miles, would connect a conveyance\r\nby water to the coast of the produce of the interior districts, which\r\nat present is sent on the backs of mules, two and three months being\r\nconsumed on the journey, and the same period with the return cargoes.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The most remarkable mountains in the vicinity of the sea\r\nare, the serra Guarapary, upon the river of the same name; that of\r\nPero-cao, further to the north; Monte Moreno, near the entrance of the\r\nbay of Espirito Santo, and Mestre-Alvaro, which is a mountain almost\r\ncircular, enjoying extensive views, and is the highest upon the coast.\r\nIt is about three miles from the beach, in parts bare and rocky, in\r\nothers covered with wood, having some fertile portions, the cultivators\r\nof which are generally within the parish of Nossa Senhora da Conceiçao\r\nof the serra. The best balsamic trees of the province are produced\r\nhere; it is situated between the rivers Carahype, and Reis Magos, and\r\nformerly had a volcano. Five miles to the south of the river Piuma is\r\nMount Agha, from whence issue excellent waters. It is a land-mark to\r\nnavigators.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--It produces gold, magnet, crystals, amethysts, and potters\r\nand other earths; the mountains in great part consist of granite.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--The _Puri_ tribes of Indians possess the western and central\r\nparts of the province, and yet make descents upon the sea-coast,\r\ngenerally doing considerable injury to the Christians who reside\r\ncontiguous to the shore. They are rather meagre in person, but are\r\ncourageous and perfidious. Some hordes are already domiciliated in\r\naldeias, and live in peace with the conquerors, in the vicinity of the\r\nriver Parahiba; but the greater portion wander about, not deviating\r\nfrom the habits of their ancestors. It is said their numbers have\r\ndiminished, in consequence of the fatal rencounters they have had with\r\nthe _Aimbore_ tribe. They do not exercise any branch of agriculture;\r\nand as the soil, though fertile, cannot gratuitously supply a\r\nsufficient maintenance, there is a perpetual attack on all kinds of\r\ngame. They are formidable enemies of the _Corados_; they use the bow\r\nand barbed arrow, and hold in high esteem all instruments of iron, and\r\nabove all the axe. The skins of animals are not used for the covering\r\nof their naked bodies, nor for any other purpose. Amongst other wild\r\nquadrupeds, the deer, boar, monkey, ounce, and anta, are well known,\r\nagainst which a continual warfare is carried on, in which the gun is\r\nused as well as the bow. A kind of monkey (Sahium) is frequently met\r\nwith, of an ash colour, with the face white. The _colhereira_, _mutun_,\r\n_jacutinga_ parrot, _arrara_, _inhuma_, _tucano_, _macuco_ partridge,\r\nand other birds of beautiful plumage, are generally seen, on proceeding\r\nbeyond the cultivated grounds, which consist only of certain portions\r\nrunning parallel with, and not extending far from the coast; domestic\r\nanimals are consequently not very numerous.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--In the woods which cover a considerable portion of the\r\ncountry there is a great diversity of trees of excellent timber for\r\nbuilding and other purposes; the Brazil wood, the sassafras, and the\r\ncedar, are well known; besides other resinous trees are those which\r\nafford gum-mastick, gum-copal, and the cajue-nut tree; those which\r\nproduce the cupahiba oil are common. No other province possesses such\r\nan abundance of the tree that supplies the Peruvian balsam. The sipo\r\nclove is met with, the leaves of which exhale an aromatic, similar to\r\nthe East Indian clove. The _piquia_ produces a fruit of the size of an\r\norange, full of a fine flavoured juice, with a great number of seeds.\r\nThe _goyty_ is a fruit of the size of a lemon, oblong, with little\r\npulp, yellow, of a fine flavour, and filled with fibres attached to\r\na large stone; there are two sorts similar in taste, and denominated\r\n_mirim_. The _pitoma_ is larger than the _mangaba_, oblong, with a\r\nsmooth rind, savory pulp, and a stone. Amongst the species of fruit\r\ntrees which the Portuguese have here naturalized, the most useful\r\nare the orange and cocoa-nut; amongst other native trees are the\r\n_jabuticaba_, the _ubaya_, whose fruit is similar to the first, of\r\nexcellent quality, and also grows upon the trunk, and even upon the\r\nroots that appear. The _arassanhuna_ is also a fruit very much like the\r\n_jabuticaba_, but not of so much flavour, and grows at the point of the\r\nbranches. The fig-tree fructifies in perfection.\r\n\r\nThe soil is particularly well adapted to the cane, of which there are\r\nmany engenhos. Legumes, coffee, cocoa, bananas, water-melons, and\r\nmandioca, which latter is not grown in sufficient quantity for the\r\nconsumption of the population, the inhabitants preferring the culture\r\nof the cotton tree, of which they make large plantations. Its produce\r\nconstitutes their principal branch of commerce and wealth; they export\r\na considerable quantity, partly in the wool, and partly in coarse\r\ncloth. A sort of narrow sail-cloth is likewise manufactured with it,\r\ncalled _tracado_, to which a preference is given to that of flax,\r\nfor forming the sails of some of the coasting vessels. The production\r\nof rice and Indian corn is considerable.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND PORTS.--The river Camapuan, commonly Cabapuanna,\r\nand which the Indians call Reritigba, originates in the serra of Pico,\r\nnot far distant from the source of the Muryahe, runs between mountains\r\naugmented by various others which join it, and enters the ocean fifteen\r\nmiles to the north of the Parahiba. It is navigable for large canoes\r\nfor a considerable space, to a certain situation, where its current\r\nbegins to be more violent and its bed less disembarrassed.\r\n\r\nTen miles to the north of the Camapuan, the Itapemirim empties itself,\r\nafter a considerable course, and is already large on crossing the\r\ncordillera. It is said that one of its branches originates in the mines\r\nof Castello, which were abandoned in consequence of the invasions of\r\nthe Puris and Aimbores. Sumacas advance some miles up it, and canoes\r\nmuch further.\r\n\r\nThe Piuma, which rises in an auriferous country to the west of the\r\ncordillera, discharges itself fourteen miles to the north of the\r\nItapemirim, and affords navigation to canoes for a considerable space.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles to the north of the Piuma is the Benevente, which is only\r\nconsiderable as far as the tide advances; it is supposed to descend\r\nfrom the cordillera.\r\n\r\nThe Guarapary, which discharges itself ten miles to the north of\r\nBenevente, is narrow and deep in the proximity of the sea, where it\r\ntraverses the cordillera, beyond which it is unknown, as well as the\r\ncountry through which it flows.\r\n\r\nThe river Jecu enters the ocean ten miles to the north of the\r\nGuarapary, and three to the south of the entrance to the bay of\r\nEspirito Santo. The Jesuits who possessed the adjacent lands, formed\r\na navigable communication from this river to the bay, by an extensive\r\nvalley, in order to avoid the dangers of the ocean, passing round mount\r\nMoreno to enter the port. It yet remains, presenting the same advantage\r\nto the present agriculturists of the country.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Espirito Santo is spacious, with secure anchorage. Amongst\r\nthe various streams which lose themselves in it, the Santa Maria is the\r\nonly considerable one. It is navigable for the space of forty miles to\r\nthe first fall. The tide runs up this river about twelve miles to the\r\nmouth of the river Serra, which unites it on the left bank; by the same\r\nside it receives another, which affords navigation to the centre of the\r\ndistrict, which indicates much fecundity. By the southern margin it is\r\njoined by the small river Crubixa, where the stones met with in its bed\r\nafford a sort of coral, with which the Indians ornament themselves.\r\nIn the vicinity of this river is cultivated mandioca, rice, bananas,\r\nand canes, the sugar of which is deemed the best in the province.\r\nSeven miles from the northern bar of Espirito Santo is the small\r\nriver Carahype, which becomes a current only when the rains produce\r\nan overflowing of the lake Jucunen, which is well stored with fish,\r\nabout three miles in length, and near the sea. A little to the north of\r\nthe mount of Mestre Alvaro, the Reys Majos, originally Apyaputang, is\r\ndischarged, having a small port at its embouchure.\r\n\r\nThe Mandu comes from the interior of the country, running\r\nnorth-north-east between woods, enters the river Doce two miles below\r\nthe Escadinha Falls, and is navigable for canoes.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this province are--\r\n\r\n    Villa da Victoria\r\n    Villa Velha\r\n    Benevente\r\n    Almeyda\r\n    Guarapary\r\n    Itapemirim.\r\n\r\nThe villa or town of Nossa Senhora of Victoria, the capital of the\r\nprovince, is situated on an amphitheatrical site on the western side\r\nof an island, fifteen miles in circumference, in the bay of Espirito\r\nSanto, which is capable of receiving frigates, and its entrance is\r\ndefended by five small forts. The town is well provided with water, has\r\ntolerable houses, paved streets, and a church, which when complete will\r\nbe handsome. There is a house of misericordia, convents of Franciscans\r\nand slippered Carmelites, two Terceira orders belonging to those\r\ncorporations, a chapel of St. Luzia, three of Nossa Senhora of Boa\r\nMorte, Conceiçao, and Rozario. The ex-Jesuitical college is a fine\r\nedifice, and now serves for the palace of the governors. The ouvidor\r\nof the comarca has his ordinary residence here. It has also a royal\r\nprofessor of Latin, and a junta da real fazenda, or the treasury. The\r\nisland is elevated, and the greatest part in a state of cultivation.\r\nIts eastern side lies in a direct line with the coast of the continent.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the bar, near the before-mentioned Moreno Mount,\r\nis another, also a land-mark to sailors, and is in the form of a\r\nsugar-loaf. On its summit is a convent of Franciscans, dedicated to\r\nNossa Senhora da Penha, of which it takes the name, not unfrequently\r\nsustaining damage by the winds. The inhabitants of this sanctuary\r\nenjoy delightful prospects of the vast ocean, and the varied scenery\r\nof mountains of a diversity of elevation and aspect, with valleys of\r\ndifferent width and profundity.\r\n\r\nIn the skirts of this mount, at the entrance of the bay, is Villa\r\nVelha, (Old Town,) originally the town of Espirito Santo, and for\r\nsome time capital of the capitania, which, however, never became\r\nconsiderable, and is now of little consequence. Our Lady of Rozario is\r\nthe patroness of the church, whose parishioners are fishermen. Fish are\r\nabundant and cheap upon all this part of the coast.\r\n\r\nBenevente is at present a small town; but it unquestionably enjoys an\r\nadvantageous situation for becoming more considerable, at the mouth\r\nof the river which takes its name, having a commodious anchorage\r\nplace, and great fertility of surrounding soil. The inhabitants are\r\nmostly Indians, for whose reception it first began. The Jesuits, its\r\nfounders, had a hospicio, or entertaining house here, which is now\r\ndivided into three portions; one is the residence of the vicar, another\r\nis appropriated to the municipal house, and the third for the use of\r\nthe ouvidor. The church is dedicated to Our Lady of Assumpçao. In the\r\nadjacencies of the river, cotton, sugar, rice, Indian corn, &c. are\r\ncultivated. The canoes which convey those productions to the port can\r\nadvance up the river with the tide for a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nGuarapary is a villota, or small place, situated near the embouchure of\r\nthe river Guarapary, upon a small bay. The church is dedicated to Nossa\r\nSenhora da Conceiçao. Its inhabitants, principally Indians, cultivate\r\ncotton and the necessaries of life. Here is collected the greatest\r\nportion of the Peruvian balsam, which takes the name of the province.\r\n\r\nAlmeyda, situated on elevated ground, near the embouchure of the Reys\r\nMagos, from whence a great extent of ocean is discovered, was founded\r\nby the Jesuits, who had a hospicio here, whither they repaired from the\r\ncollege of the capital to learn the Tupininquin language. This edifice\r\nhas been for a long time the residence of the vicars, and its handsome\r\nchapel, dedicated to Reys Magos, has always served for the mother\r\nchurch. It has a considerable piece of ground attached to it, in the\r\nform of a square. In no other parish of the bishopric have the number\r\nof native Indians increased so much as here; with them are intermixed\r\nsome whites and mesticos. The whole pursue fishing, and are farmers of\r\nthe first necessaries. They export some earthenware and timber.\r\n\r\nFive miles to the north of Almeyda is the Aldeia Velha, (the Old\r\nAldeia,) inhabited by Christianized Indians. It has commodious\r\nanchorage for sumacas at the mouth of a small river.\r\n\r\nFurther on there is another aldeia of Goytacaze Indians, also\r\nChristians. The whole cultivate the necessaries of life, practise\r\nfishing, and many pursue the manufacture of earthenware. Orange trees\r\nare remarkably abundant, and the fruit excellent. A considerable\r\nquantity of gamellas (wooden bowls) are exported.\r\n\r\nItapemirim stands on the southern margin, and two miles above the mouth\r\nof the river of the same name. It has a parish church of Our Lady of\r\nAmparo. A considerable augmentation of this place is anticipated. Its\r\ninhabitants drink the waters of the river, cultivate plantations of the\r\nsugar cane, and the cotton tree, rice, Indian corn, &c. and cut timber;\r\nall these are articles of exportation.\r\n\r\nOn the margin of the river Piuma there is an aldeia of the same name,\r\nwhose inhabitants cultivate the necessaries of life peculiar to the\r\ncountry, and cut much timber from the neighbouring woods. Vessels of a\r\nsmall size can be constructed here.\r\n\r\nOn the margin of the river Doce, two miles below the mouth of the\r\nMandu, there is a prezidio, with the name of Souza, in order to impede\r\nthe smuggling of gold from Minas Geraes, and which may become in time a\r\nconsiderable povoaçao. The surrounding territory is highly fertile. One\r\nquart of the seed of feijao will generally produce ninety Winchester\r\nbushels; and lower down, upon an island in the same river, the same\r\nquantity of seed has rendered one hundred and fifteen Winchester\r\nbushels, which is nearly four hundred for one. A quart of Indian corn\r\ncommonly produces one hundred and fifteen bushels. A shrub grows here,\r\nthe bruised leaves of which afford a liquor by infusion, which will dye\r\na fast purple colour.\r\n\r\nNear the river Jecu, at a great distance above its mouth, in a fertile\r\ndistrict, is beginning to flourish the arraial of the same name,\r\ninhabited by white agriculturists, and abounding with game.\r\n\r\nIn the latitude of 20°, and upwards of five hundred miles distant from\r\nthe coast of this province, is the small and rocky island of Ascension,\r\nalso called Trinidade. It has good water; but having no good anchorage\r\nplace, and little of its surface being susceptible of cultivation, it\r\nis uninhabited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\n                       PROVINCE OF PORTO SEGURO.\r\n\r\n   _Boundaries--Prosperity of its first Donatory--Reversion\r\n   to the Crown in a bad State--Present partial Cultivation--\r\n   Indians--Mountains--Mineralogy--Zoology--Phytology--Rivers,\r\n   Lakes, and Ports--Povoações--Abrolhos._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis province, which comprises the territory of the capitania of\r\nthe same name, with one portion of that of Ilheos, and another of\r\nthat of Espirito Santo, is confined on the north by the province of\r\nBahia, from which it is separated by the river Belmonte, on the west\r\nby Minas Geraes, on the south by Espirito Santo, and on the east by\r\nthe ocean. It lies between 15° 54′ and 19° 31′ of south latitude,\r\nand in consequence of its being like the province of Espirito Santo\r\nimperfectly explored, and from the same cause, of being in great part\r\nunder the dominion of the Indians, its width cannot be precisely\r\ndetermined. A different result might have justly been expected, as\r\nit is without contradiction that part of the new world where the\r\nPortuguese were first established. It has already been shown that\r\nCabral left here two degradados in the year 1500, and Christovam Jaques\r\na large number of other individuals, with two Franciscan missionaries\r\nin the year 1504. The excellent quality of the Brazil wood, which\r\nthe first explorers found in abundance, soon rendered it an object\r\nof public contract, and the good understanding which the colony\r\nmaintained] with the Indians, also contributed to its being regularly\r\nand annually visited for the purpose of so important a traffic.\r\n\r\nWhen John III. partitioned this region into capitanias, the colony of\r\nPorto Seguro had begun to flourish, and many ships destined for India\r\nrefreshed in its port. The three Indians, which George Lopez Bixorda\r\npresented to King Emanuel in 1513, were Tupininquins, the allies and\r\nfriends of the colonists of Porto Seguro, and the interpreter who\r\naccompanied them was one of the degradados left there by Cabral in\r\n1500. This Bixorda had the contract for Brazil wood, and in order to\r\nshow the king a sample of his new subjects, the three Indians were\r\nconveyed to Portugal in the ship laden with this precious wood,\r\nwithout any change of their rude and native dress, the peculiarity\r\nof which consisted in their bodies being dressed or ornamented with\r\nfeathers, and their lips, noses, and ears distorted with immense\r\npendants; their usual weapons of defence, the bow and arrow, added to\r\nthe interest which their appearance excited.\r\n\r\nThe name of Porto Seguro, (Secure Port,) given to the bay where the\r\ndiscovering armada anchored, also soon became common to the anchorage\r\nplace of the river Buranhen, with the establishment of the colony which\r\nC. Jaques planted upon its margin, in the place where the principal\r\nor high part of the capital is now situated. It soon after became the\r\nfactory also for the Brazil wood.\r\n\r\nPedro do Campo Tourinho, its first donatory, after having sold all he\r\npossessed, for the purpose of transporting himself, his wife, Ignez\r\nFernandes Pinta, one son, called Fernam do Campo Tourinho, and various\r\nfamilies who agreed to accompany him, arrived safe in the port of the\r\nfactory. Not one of the other donatories experienced so prosperous a\r\ndisembarkation. His colony was a considerable augmentation of that of\r\nC. Jaques, or the factory, where he found many countrymen, some of whom\r\nhad been more than thirty years in the country, with their half Indian\r\nprogeny, called _Mamalucos_, living in full harmony with the\r\naborigines.\r\n\r\nIn a few years he found himself in a considerable and flourishing town.\r\nBesides the town of Santa Cruz he founded that of St. Amaro, and other\r\naldeias, with which the establishment was greatly increased, and before\r\nhis death had acquired a very flourishing state.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Amaro, any vestige of which can scarcely at present\r\nbe discovered, near the morro crowned with a hermitage of Our Lady\r\nd’Ajuda, three miles to the south of Porto Seguro, was demolished by\r\nthe ferocious _Abatyra_ Indians in the year 1564.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Cruz, which was commenced upon Cabralia Bay, (Bay of\r\nCabral,) was removed by its inhabitants near to the river Joao de Tyba,\r\nin consequence of its more favourable soil.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Ja^s. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  BOTOCUDO INDIANS, ABOUT TO CROSS A RIVER.]\r\n\r\nThe first donatory was succeeded by his said son, who did not live\r\nto enjoy it long. To Fernam do Campo Tourinho succeeded his sister,\r\nLeonor do Campo Tourinho, widow of Gregorio de Pesqueira, to whom the\r\nking confirmed the capitania by letter of the 30th of May, 1556. Two\r\nmonths afterwards she sold it, by permission of the Sovereign, to the\r\nDuke d’Aveiro, Don John de Lancastre, to whom the King, in the same\r\nlaw, granted licence, at his death, to nominate his son, Don Pedro\r\nDeniz de Lancastre, from whose successors it reverted to the crown in\r\nthe reign of Joseph I. in a very bad state and with only two towns.\r\nOne hundred milreas (about £25) _de juro_, or right, six hundred\r\nmilreas (about £150) in money, and two moyos (about seventy Winchester\r\nbushels each) of wheat every year as long as the vendor lived, was\r\nthe price stipulated in the writings of the sale. The Jesuits, who\r\nfounded a house in the capital in 1553, with the intention of better\r\nreducing the Indians to Catholicism, only left two aldeias entirely\r\nIndian, of which they were the curates. Amongst the most able of those\r\nin the course of two hundred and five years, who became curates in\r\nthese missions, many went there to be catechised previous to studying\r\ntheology at the college of Bahia, in order to learn more perfectly the\r\nidiom of the Indians, who were not taught the Portuguese language, as\r\nthey only treated or had intercourse with the curates, who were well\r\nacquainted with their language.\r\n\r\nThe Abatyra Indians, at the period before alluded to, destroyed,\r\namongst other places, the towns of Juassema and St. Andre, founded\r\nby the duke. These Indians, now unknown, are said to be a horde of\r\nthe Aimores, or perhaps this was the name by which the Tupininquins\r\ndesignated them in general. The Aimores are believed to have been a\r\ntribe of northern Tapuyas, who, in ancient times, in consequence of\r\nthe wars, proceeded southward, and retired to the west of the serra\r\nwhich afterwards took their name. The neighbouring nations called them\r\nAimbores, and the Portuguese, from corruption, Aimores; but, for a\r\nconsiderable time, they have had no other name amongst the Christians\r\nthan Botocudos, in consequence of their custom of perforating the ears\r\nand lips. They always wander about, divided into parties of forty to\r\nsixty families, destroying game, and gathering wild fruits, their\r\nordinary aliment. Some paint the body, at times, a green colour, at\r\nothers yellow; and in order to free themselves from the attacks of the\r\nmosquito, at certain seasons, or in places where they most incommode\r\nthem, they varnish the skin with the juice or milk of certain trees.\r\nTheir arms are the bow and the arrow barbed on both sides. They have no\r\nother conveyance by water, but jangadas, or catamarans, rudely formed\r\nof the trunks of the jangada tree, and put together with very little\r\ncare, with which they cross large rivers. Their combats, like those\r\nof all other Indians, are from ambuscades, and they commonly make the\r\nassault after dark, and only when they judge that they are taking their\r\nenemy by surprise. Some tribes, when they have determined to engage\r\nthe foe, leave the aged, the women, and children, in some secure place\r\nin the centre of their district. Their barbarity has always produced\r\nthe idea that they are much more numerous than they are really found\r\nto be. The garrisons newly established upon the eastern line of the\r\nprovince of Minas Geraes, and those in the centre of this, have obliged\r\nmany to sue for that peace which had been so frequently offered them,\r\nand which they always rejected, secure in extensive woods, where there\r\nare few, if any, Christian colonists to subdue their wild habits, or\r\nmitigate their savage propensities.\r\n\r\nOf all the provinces of the Brazil, this may be said to be the most\r\nbackward in cultivation, and in the civilization of the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants. It is almost one wood of fine timber, and different\r\nspecies of trees, indicating, beyond a question, the great fertility\r\ngenerally of its soil. The want of good ports capable of receiving\r\nlarge ships is assigned as the cause of its present condition; but want\r\nof industry, and the requisite energy and spirit of improvement, as\r\nwell as the deficiency, it must be allowed, of population, are the real\r\ncauses. The Christianized population only possess the parts adjacent\r\nto the ocean, and few days pass in certain months of the year, that\r\nits coasts are not visited by the Indians in search of the eggs of\r\nthe tortoise. From these people the _Canarins_ are known, who are the\r\nnearest hordes to the towns of Caravellas, and Villaviçoza. It is said\r\nthat they have an establishment of one vast house in the centre of the\r\ncountry, hid in a valley between two mountains. The _Machacaris_ are\r\nmasters of a country washed by the rivers Norte and Sul. In the western\r\npart are known the _Cumanacho_, _Mono_, _Frecha_, _Catathoy_, _Aimore_,\r\nand the _Patacho_ nations; the last are more numerous than all the\r\nothers together, and extend themselves, divided into tribes, from one\r\nextremity of the province to the other.\r\n\r\nThe Aimores are anthropophagi, and the dread of all the other nations\r\nexcept the Patachos.\r\n\r\nFrom the river Doce, the southern limit of this province, as far as a\r\nleague to the north of the Jucurucu, the lands are so flat, that they\r\nscarcely exceed the level of the highest tides. In the whole of this\r\ntract, (more than one hundred miles,) not one mountain, or even small\r\nelevation is seen. From this point nearly to the Buranhen, the shore\r\nis of a green or white colour, and of four to six yards in height;\r\nthe remainder of the coast to the river Belmonte is in parts flat, in\r\nothers rather more elevated. Fine woods are everywhere seen extending\r\nto the margin of the ocean.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--Those in the central and western parts are unknown. At the\r\nnorthern extremity of the eastern side only is discovered the serra of\r\nAimores, the highest portion of which, denominated the Mount of John de\r\nSiam, and the outer portion Mount Pascoal, is seen for many leagues at\r\nsea, being the principal land-mark in this latitude.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Gold, iron, granite, calcareous stone, white potters’\r\nearth, with other argils, amethysts, topazes, and other precious stones.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--Domestic animals are in all parts very rare, if we except the\r\nenvirons of the capital. In the woods are the deer, boar, _tamandua_,\r\nmonkey, _anta_, with various other species of this region, generally\r\nvery numerous. Ounces are here in the greatest number, and commit their\r\ndepredations upon the sea-coast from April to August, in consequence,\r\nit is thought, of the cold, which makes them desert the western lands,\r\nand seek the vicinity of the sea, where it is warmer. Hunters find\r\nwith much facility the _mutun_, _juru_, _macuco_ partridge, _jacu_,\r\n_jacutinga_, _aracuan_, _nhamba_, _capueira_, parrot, and a diversity\r\nof the turtle bird. The _araponga_, _bicudo_, and _sabio_ are well\r\nknown. The _pavo_, or peacock, is little larger than the _tucano_,\r\nblack, with the breast yellow and red. The _crijoha_ is something\r\nlarger than the blackbird, and its change of colours beautiful. The\r\nbees produce honey in the trunks of trees, supplying aliment to a great\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--Amongst many other trees of good timber are the\r\n_vinathico_, _aderno_, _avariba_, _anhuhyba_, _aricurana_, _anhahyba de\r\nrego_, _angelim_, of different colours; also the _biriba_, _buranhen_,\r\n_camacary_, _caixeta_, cedar, cherry, _conduru_, _grapiapunha_,\r\n_guanandirana_, _hoyticica_, _jatahy_; of the _jacaranda_, are the\r\nsorts called _cabuina_, mulatto and white; of the _jucirana_, white\r\nand green; the _jiquitiba_, _inhuhybatan_, and the clove; _ipe_, black\r\nand other sorts; _piqui_, black, yellow, otherwise _mirindiba_; the\r\n_potumuju_, bow wood, oil wood, Brazil wood, _oanandy_, _sapucaya_,\r\n_sobro_, _sucupiracu_, _sucupira acary_, _tatagiba_, white and green\r\n_timbuhyba_; the _jabuticaba_, the _aracaza_, the _pindahyba_, and\r\nvarious palm trees are well known; the Asiatic cocoa-nut tree is not\r\nvery frequent. There is a tree, the leaves of which, when broken,\r\nexhale the aromatic smell of the clove. The tree which produces the\r\n_pechurim_, here improperly called mulberry tree, is rare, and its\r\nfruit not so fine as that of Para. The soil is good for the culture of\r\nmandioca, the most valuable produce of the country; Indian corn, rice,\r\nand legumes grow in some districts. Cotton trees prosper best in the\r\nvicinity of the sea, at least in many situations.\r\n\r\nRIVERS, LAKES, AND PORTS.--The river Doce has its heads in the centre\r\nof Minas Geraes, and, flowing through part of that province, leaves it,\r\nalready accumulated by its tributary streams into a considerable river,\r\nunder the name by which it is here known. After it begins to divide\r\nthis province from that of Espirito Santo, it is precipitated in the\r\nspace of one league over three falls, denominated the Escadinhas. From\r\nhence to the ocean it is large, serpentine, and handsome, and has many\r\nflat islands. Its waters are muddy in the summer season, in consequence\r\nof the minerals of Minas Geraes with which it is impregnated; and this\r\nappearance is partly caused, it may be inferred, by the auriferous\r\nbed through which there cannot be a doubt, from what has been already\r\nobserved, the latter part of its course is impelled. Its waters are\r\ndischarged between two points of flat sand of considerable extent; and\r\nthis aqueous volume preserves its freshness for a considerable distance\r\ninto the ocean, from which circumstance its primitive name was changed\r\nto that of Doce (Soft, or Fresh.)\r\n\r\nThe St. Mattheus, originally the Cricare, has its source in Minas\r\nGeraes. Soon after entering this province, it runs for the space of\r\nmany miles with great violence, occasioned by the impulse it acquires\r\nin descending various falls. A little below this current, which is\r\nsupposed to be in the meridian of the Escadinhas, it receives by\r\nthe left the large river Cotache, which traverses extensive woods,\r\ninhabited by Indians and wild beasts. It irrigates one of the most\r\nfertile countries of the state, and discharges itself into the sea\r\nthirty-five miles north of the Doce. A little above its embouchure it\r\nreceives by the northern margin the St. Anna, which is navigable with\r\nthe tide.\r\n\r\nThe Mucury, which is considerable as far as the tide advances,\r\noriginates in Minas Geraes, and with a rapid current enters the sea\r\nnear thirty miles to the north of the St. Mattheus. In the vicinity\r\nof the ocean it traverses a most fertile district, covered with fine\r\nwoods, occupied by wild quadrupeds, beyond which it passes through\r\nlands rich in gold and precious stones. This river communicates with\r\nthe Peruhype.\r\n\r\nThe Peruhype, whose mouth is fifteen miles north of the Mucury,\r\noriginates in the centre of the province, and is apparently\r\nconsiderable, with a tide running many leagues up.\r\n\r\nTen miles north of the preceding is the mouth of the channel called the\r\nriver Caravellas, but which is only an arm that the sea extends ten\r\nmiles to the west, of considerable width, very deep, and beautifully\r\nbordered with mangroves. The entrance is only accessible to small\r\nvessels. About the middle of its extent, there is a spacious channel of\r\ngreat depth communicating with the Peruhype.\r\n\r\nThe Itanhem, after a long course, enters the sea fifteen miles north\r\nof Caravellas, and affords navigation for canoes for a considerable\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe Jucurucu, which discharges itself fifteen miles north of the\r\nItanhem, takes its name at the confluence of the afore-mentioned river\r\nDo Sul, (South) with the Do Norte, (North) which unite about twenty\r\nmiles from the sea, and afford navigation to canoes for a considerable\r\nspace into the interior of the country. Sumacas advance up this river\r\nas far as the said confluence.\r\n\r\nThirty miles to the north of the Jucurucu is the point Corumbau, by\r\ncorruption Corumbabo; three miles further the mouth of the river\r\nCramimuan, at the bottom of a large bay; and a little further the small\r\nriver Juassema, near whose mouth is yet seen the vestiges of the town\r\nso called.\r\n\r\nEight miles north of the Cramimuan is the river Do Frade, (Friar,)\r\nwhich took its name from the shipwreck of a religious Franciscan. Its\r\ncourse is through woods, and it is only capable of receiving canoes.\r\n\r\nThe Buranhen, for a long period here designated only the Cachoeira, in\r\nconsequence of a fall, (_cachoeira_,) which it passed about the centre\r\nof the province, enters the sea eighteen miles north of the Frade: its\r\norigin is unknown; but not being considerable, it may be inferred that\r\nits course is not extensive; that portion of it explored flows from the\r\nsouth-west to the north-east, with many windings. It affords various\r\nsorts of fish, such as are called here _piaus_, _trahiras_, _robalos_,\r\n_acaris_, _piabanhas_, _piabas_, _jundias_, _pitus_, and very large\r\n_prones_ in abundance.\r\n\r\nIt is followed, at a distance of about eighteen miles by the St. Cruz,\r\nsomething smaller, and navigable by canoes. It took this name after the\r\ninhabitants of the town of St. Cruz removed to its margin, then called\r\nthe Joam de Tyba. They formed the first colony in its vicinity. It is\r\nstored with the same fish as the preceding one.\r\n\r\nThe St. Antonio, the waters of which are muddy, with an inconsiderable\r\ncourse, is a few leagues north of the preceding.\r\n\r\nThe lake Juparana, deep, abounding with fish, interspersed with small\r\nislands, and about fifteen miles in circuit, bordered with fine woods,\r\ngrowing upon an uneven and fertile country, is twenty miles from the\r\nsea, has an outlet into the river Doce by a narrow and deep channel\r\nfive miles in length, and receives a river called Cachoeira, which is\r\nsaid to be navigable.\r\n\r\nBetween the mouth of the Doce and the St. Mattheus is the lake Tapada,\r\nof considerable length from east to west but very narrow.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Medo, (Fear,) very small, is in the proximity of the origin\r\nof St. Antonio and communicates with the Belmonte.\r\n\r\nThe lake Braco, long and narrow, prolongs itself with the coast,\r\nbetween the Belmonte and the Mugiquissaba, which is small, and enters\r\nthe ocean about eighteen miles south of the first.\r\n\r\nThe Belmonte, so called after the town of the same name was founded\r\nnear its mouth, is formed in Serro do Frio, one of the comarcas of\r\nMinas Geraes, by the waters of the Jiquitinhonha and Arassuahy. When\r\nit traverses the cordillera of Aimores it is contracted between two\r\nmountains of unequal elevation; the northern one, called St. Bruno, is\r\nthe highest, and on a sudden descends from a height of more than forty\r\nyards into a whirlpool, whose evaporation exhibits an eternal cloud,\r\nand the loud murmuring of its falling waters is heard sometimes twelve\r\nand fifteen miles off. Continuing for the space of fifteen miles to\r\nthe east between rugged margins to a _cachocirinha_, (a little\r\nfall,) it flows through a flat and woody country to the sea, describing\r\nvarious windings, with a current rapid and wide but of little depth.\r\nIts fish called _tubarõe_ is of an enormous size, and the\r\n_cacoe_ is the smallest of its finny inhabitants. It has many\r\nflat islands within its margins, and does not receive any considerable\r\nstream after it descends the fall.\r\n\r\nThe Piauhy, which unites the Belmonte below this fall, is the most\r\nabundant amongst those which it receives, after commencing to serve as\r\na limit to this province.\r\n\r\nCabralia Bay, (where the armada of Cabral anchored,) fifteen miles to\r\nthe north of Porto Seguro, and four to the south of St. Cruz, is the\r\nonly port of the province where large vessels can enter.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Concha, near the Mugiquissaba, is a roadstead which might be\r\nrendered capable of receiving vessels of large burden.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this province are--\r\n\r\n    Porto Seguro\r\n    Villaverde\r\n    Trancozo\r\n    Prado\r\n    Alcobaca\r\n    Caravellas\r\n    Villaviçoza\r\n    Portalegre\r\n    St. Mattheus\r\n    Belmonte.\r\n\r\nPorto Seguro, a considerable town, and capital of the province, is\r\nsituated at the mouth of the river Buranhen, upon an elevation on the\r\nnorthern side, with an agreeable aspect, enjoying salubrious air, and\r\nprovided with good water. It has a church of Nossa Senhora da Penna, a\r\nhouse of misericordia, and an ex-Jesuitical hospicio, at present the\r\nresidence of the ouvidors. The houses are of brick or wood, and the\r\nstreets unpaved. The main part of its inhabitants frequent the fishing\r\nof _garoupas_, which form an important branch of their commerce.\r\nIt has, as is usual, a royal professor of Latin. Its surrounding lands\r\nare appropriated to divers productions, none of which are superabundant\r\nexcept fruits. Porto Seguro, it is said, was once larger, but upon the\r\noccasion previously referred to was nearly dismantled by the Abatyras,\r\nand being rebuilt, again suffered much from the invasions of the\r\n_Guerens_, who, perhaps, would have annihilated it altogether if\r\nthe celebrated Tateno, a cacique or chief from the river St. Antonio,\r\nwho was a scourge to the other savages and a friend of the Christians,\r\nhad not succoured them, in spite of the diseases under which he\r\nlaboured at the time, and which did not permit him to move, except in\r\na net or rede, carried upon the shoulders of his most robust comrades.\r\nThe small povoaçoes of Pontinha, Marcos, and Pacatta, the whole\r\nupon the northern margin of the river, scarcely separated by small\r\nintervals, are so many other parts of this town.\r\n\r\nVillaverde, originally Patatiba, is small but well situated, has a\r\nchurch dedicated to Espirito Santo, (Holy Spirit,) and a municipal\r\nhouse. It is eighteen miles above the capital, upon the southern margin\r\nof the same river, near a large lake. It has a profusion of fruits, and\r\nabundance of water from fountains. The soil is of great fertility, but\r\nis entirely left to the indolence of the Christianized Indians, amongst\r\nwhom a white is scarcely seen. They export some timber and a little\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nEighteen miles north of the capital, near the mouth of the St. Cruz,\r\nthe parish of this name, formerly considerable, has decayed, in\r\nconsequence of the invasions of the Guerens. It has a church, dedicated\r\nto Nossa Senhora of Conceiçao; and in the vicinity a tree is common,\r\nthe fruit of which is called the quince. The proximity of Cabralia\r\nBay, and the roads which are expected to be opened from divers points\r\nof Minas Geraes, will probably render this povoaçao a flourishing and\r\nconsiderable place.\r\n\r\nTrancozo is an inconsiderable town, well situated, near the mouth of\r\na small river; the church is dedicated to St. John Baptista, and its\r\ninhabitants, almost generally Indians, cultivate cotton and mandioca,\r\nand are also fishermen. It is fifteen miles south of Porto Seguro.\r\n\r\nPrado, situated at the mouth of the Jucurucu, which was its primitive\r\nname, is forty miles to the south of Trancozo. A considerable quantity\r\nof farinha (flour of mandioca) is exported from hence, at present\r\nthe only riches of its inhabitants. Its church is dedicated to the\r\nPurificaçao de Nossa Senhora.\r\n\r\nAlcobaça, another small town, near the mouth of the Itanhen, of which\r\nit originally had the name, has a church dedicated to St. Bernardo. The\r\npopulation, generally Indian, and the agriculture, begin to increase,\r\nby the establishments of various farmers, who removed hither from\r\nCaravellas, in consequence of the woods or mattas remaining uncut in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the town.\r\n\r\nCaravellas is a considerable town, upon the northern margin of the\r\nriver of the same name, about five miles from the sea, and almost in\r\nfront of the channel which communicates with the Peruhype. It consists\r\nof three streets parallel with the river, which forms a good port,\r\ncapable even of receiving large vessels, if the bar were accessible. It\r\nis the most frequented of any other town in the province; has a church\r\ncalled St. Antonio, and royal masters of the primitive letters and\r\nLatin. Almost all its inhabitants cultivate mandioca, which is nearly\r\nthree years in the ground before it reaches maturity; they can scarcely\r\nmake two plantations of it, as already in the second the ants have\r\naccumulated upon it to a destructive extent. The lands overgrow with\r\nbrushwood immediately the woods are cleared away. The water-melons,\r\n_aboboras_, bananas, and oranges, are very fine. There are places\r\ncovered entirely with the _jabuticaba_ tree. A great quantity of\r\nfarinha is exported from hence. Various families, who escaped from\r\nthe catastrophe which attended the destruction of the towns in the\r\nvicinity of the capital by the Indians, commenced this town, upon the\r\nright bank of the river, near the bar, from whence it was shortly\r\nafterwards removed to the situation which it now occupies. They are now\r\nlabouring in the opening of a road or track, to communicate with that\r\nof Portalegre, which leads to Minas Geraes.\r\n\r\nVillaviçoza, at first called Campinho, upon the southern margin, and\r\nfour miles above the mouth of the river Peruhype, is yet small, with\r\na church of N. Senhora da Conceiçao. Its inhabitants produce much\r\nfarinha, and the vessels by which the superfluity is exported navigate\r\ncommonly by the river Caravellas, and the channel before mentioned, in\r\nconsequence of the little depth which the Peruhype has at the bar.\r\n\r\nPortalegre, at the mouth of the river Mucury, of which it originally\r\nhad the name, is a small town, without any thing remarkable; but the\r\nextensive navigation of the river and the fertility of its surrounding\r\nlands promise it future augmentation. Its church is dedicated to St.\r\nJoze; and its inhabitants, besides other necessaries, produce and\r\nexport a considerable quantity of farinha, with some flax of ticum, and\r\ntimber. In its district there are minerals of iron. From this town, a\r\nroad runs to Villa do Principe in Minas Geraes.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Mattheus, without regularity, upon gently elevated\r\nground, on the right margin, and fifteen miles above the bar of the\r\nriver so called, does not yet exceed mediocrity, but is well supplied\r\nwith fish and good water. Many circumstances, however, concur to\r\nwarrant the expectation of its becoming flourishing, when the Indians\r\nare reduced. Its inhabitants hitherto respire air infected by the\r\nneighbouring swamps, which occasionally produce fevers, terminating\r\nsometimes in death. They cultivate feijao, rice, Indian corn,\r\ncotton, the sugar cane, and above all mandioca, the farinha of which\r\nis exported to a great extent. Many other branches of agriculture\r\nwould flourish in this district, the fertility of which is perhaps\r\nunequalled, and not materially infested with ants. The water-melon is\r\nhere excellent, and oranges and lemons are abundant.\r\n\r\nBelmonte is a town situated in the angle of the mouth of the river,\r\nwhich took its name, and which injures it occasionally, at the period\r\nof the greatest floods. It was first an aldeia of Christian Indians,\r\nand consists of three streets, in a line, with houses generally of\r\nearth. The church is called Our Lady of Carmo, and the people are of\r\nall complexions.\r\n\r\nOn the margin of the river Doce, near the outlet of the lake Juparana,\r\nis the increasing aldeia of Linhares, to which a vicar was appointed\r\nin 1815, in consequence of its inhabitants becoming numerous. With the\r\nview of impeding the invasions of the savages, as well as commencing\r\nnew povoaçoes, were recently established the detachments of Arcos,\r\nnear the margin of the river Belmonte, above the great fall; Aveiro,\r\nupon the river St. Cruz; Aquiar, in the district of Villaverde;\r\nLinhares, on the river Frade; Cunha, on the Cramimuan; Vimieyro, on the\r\nJucurucu; Obidos, in the district of Alcobaca; Caparica, upon the river\r\nPeruhype; Araujo, upon the Mucury; Itahunas, upon the Guaxindiba, which\r\ndischarges itself four miles north of the St. Mattheus; and Galveas,\r\nabove the town of St. Mattheus, upon the margin of the river of that\r\nname. All the parochials of this province are in the jurisdiction of\r\nthe bishopric of Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nIn front of the bar of the river Caravellas, and forty miles from the\r\ncoast, are the islands of St. Barbara, generally known by the name\r\nof Abrolhos, four in number, and a short distance from each other;\r\nthe largest and most easterly is two miles in length, and has some\r\nvegetation. Portions of a large shoal, which extends two hundred miles\r\nfrom east to west, in consequence of the dangers which they present to\r\nnavigators, were called _Abrolhos_ (“open the eyes.”) There is no\r\nwater found upon these islands, and they are generally covered with\r\nmarine birds. Upon these shoals the fishing of the _garoupas_ is\r\npursued, producing the next branch of exportation to farinha; this is\r\na fish which does not exceed two palms in length, is very thick, of a\r\ngreen colour, without scales, has little bone, is very white, and is\r\nesteemed savory when fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP.

It extends from 10°\r\nto 16° south latitude, comprising three hundred and fifty miles from\r\nnorth to south, and about two hundred and forty miles in width from\r\nthe coast to the town of Urubu, situated upon the margin of the St.\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nTradition and history announce four remarkable events anterior to\r\nthe foundation of the capital, from which the colonization of the\r\nprovince commenced:--the shipwreck of Diogo Alvez Correa, that of a\r\nCastilian ship, the disembarkation of its only donatory, Francisco\r\nPeyreyra Coutinho, and his unfortunate end. None of the writers on\r\nthis subject have assigned any distinct epoch to those circumstances,\r\nand the discordancy which obtains amongst them veils their relations\r\nin obscurity. The Jesuit Vasconcellos was the first who published, one\r\nhundred and fifty years after their occurrence, the adventures of\r\nDiogo Alvez Correa, the _Caramuru_,[26] almost in the shape of a\r\nnovel, and which subjects this portion of the early history of this\r\nprovince to incoherencies and doubts. The said Jesuit who asserted that\r\nhe wrote from circumstantial documents, says he does not know whether\r\nthe vessel of the shipwrecked _Caramuru_ was proceeding to India\r\nor the capitania of St. Vincente, as he pretends that the latter was\r\nthen in progress of colonization, by Martim Affonso de Souza, which,\r\nfrom concurring testimony, is an affirmation not founded in truth;\r\nCorrea’s shipwreck having occurred in 1510, upwards of twenty years\r\nprevious to that event; and the vessel was unquestionably either one of\r\nthose included in the contract for Brazil wood, or in the progress of\r\nan exploration of the coast, and did not belong to any of the armaments\r\ndestined for India.\r\n\r\nThe epoch of Correa’s shipwreck, who was a person of noble birth, and\r\nhis being the first European settler at Bahia, is confirmed by the\r\nevidence of Herrera, who, in describing the misfortunes that attended\r\nthe St. Pitta, one of two Spanish ships that sailed from St. Lucar, in\r\nSeptember, 1534, (from which it would appear also, the shipwreck of the\r\nSpanish vessel before alluded to, happened in the year 1535,) says,\r\n“_onde hallaron un Portuguez, que dixo, que avia veynte y cinco ãnos,\r\nque estava entre los Indios_.”[27] A person now living at Porto\r\nSeguro has in his possession an ancient manuscript, which affirms that\r\nGaspar de Lemos, on proceeding to Lisbon with despatches of Cabral’s\r\nnew discovery, entered the river Ilheos and the Bay of All Saints;\r\nwhere some sailors went on shore, and were suddenly attacked by the\r\nIndians; that Diogo Alvez Correa, not having time to embark with his\r\ncompanions, fled to a place where he was soon found by those savages.\r\nThis would make Correa the Caramuru’s residence near Bahia, to have\r\ncommenced in 1500; but, as this circumstance is not alluded to in the\r\nauthentic statements of Cabral’s expedition, it would still appear more\r\nprobable that Correa was thrown amongst the Indians, in consequence of\r\nthe shipwreck alluded to in 1510.\r\n\r\nAt the period when King John III. divided the Brazil into capitanias,\r\nFrancisco Peyreyra Coutinho was in Portugal, having recently returned\r\nfrom India, where he had rendered important services to the state,\r\nin remuneration for which, the said King granted him a capitania\r\nof all the country which lay between the point of Padrao, (now\r\ndenominated St. Antonio,) and the St. Francisco, giving him afterwards\r\nthe reconcave of the bay of All Saints. He proceeded in person to\r\ncolonize this donation, with an armament fitted out at his own cost,\r\nand disembarked at the point of Padrao. He fortified himself on the\r\nsite where the mother church of Our Lady of Victory is situated, and\r\npreserved a state of amity with the Indians for some years. Cultivation\r\nbegan to extend, and the more opulent and powerful settlers had\r\nalready established sugar works, when the Tupinamba Indians commenced\r\nan inveterate and unceasing warfare for the period of seven or eight\r\nyears against them, carrying destruction and famine amongst the sugar\r\nworks and new establishments. Coutinho, with the small force which\r\nnow remained, discovered the impossibility of repairing the evils his\r\ncolony had sustained, and, consequently, determined to withdraw from\r\nthe increasing enmity and attacks of the Indians, which he accomplished\r\nin one caravel, conducting the remains of the colony to the capitania\r\nof Ilheos, where the Portuguese settlers were living in a state of\r\nprofound peace with the Tupininquin Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Tupinambas were a powerful tribe, and other hordes of Indians who\r\npreviously occupied the territory around Bahia, had been compelled to\r\ngive way to them. They affected to feel the circumstances attending\r\nthe departure and absence of the Portuguese, to whom they proposed\r\nterms of friendship, which were acceded to. Coutinho lost no time in\r\nre-embarking for the bay of All Saints, where, on arriving at the\r\nentrance of the harbour, they were assailed by a tremendous gale of\r\nwind, which drove them on the shoals off the island of Itaparica, and\r\nall those who escaped on shore from the wreck were devoured by the\r\ncannibal Indians, (also of the Tupinamba tribe,) excepting Diogo Alvez\r\nCorrea, who had accompanied Coutinho in his flight. Caramuru saved\r\nhis life from the circumstance of speaking the Tupinamba language. He\r\nacquired considerable consequence amongst the Indians, and was elevated\r\nto the rank of a prince. The chiefs offered him their daughters in\r\nmarriage, and his distinction was marked by the grant of a plurality\r\nof wives. His offspring was numerous, and even at this day some of the\r\ninhabitants of Bahia trace their origin to him.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of Coutinho’s misfortunes, the territory of Bahia became\r\n_devoluto_, unoccupied; and the same monarch being informed of\r\nthe beauties and advantages of this fine bay, and the fertility of\r\nits adjacent country, determined to found a city there, which should\r\nbecome the capital of all the colonies, in order to afford them every\r\nnecessary succour against the Indians, who were at this period making\r\nuniversal progress in their attempts against the new settlers. An\r\narmament was accordingly prepared, of five ships, with six hundred\r\nvolunteers, four hundred _degradados_, (criminals,) an abundant\r\nprovision of every thing requisite for the foundation and defence\r\nof the colony, some Jesuitical priests, in order to catholicize the\r\nIndians, and many other sacerdotals for the administration of that\r\nfaith. This important enterprise was intrusted to an illustrious\r\nindividual named Thome de Souza, who had distinguished himself in\r\nAfrica and India, and the jurisdiction of the Brazilian state, or New\r\nLusitania, was conferred upon him under the title of governor general.\r\nBy this measure the sovereign suspended and limited the power which had\r\nbeen given to the donatories of the different capitanias. Doctor Pedro\r\nBorges was appointed ouvidor general, to register the proceedings of\r\nall the capitanias. Antonio Cardozo de Barros, procurador of the royal\r\ntreasury, (or attorney general,) and some servants of the king were to\r\nreceive situations in the public offices.\r\n\r\nThe squadron left Lisbon on the 2d of February, 1549, and on the 29th\r\nof March, arrived in the port where the unfortunate donatory had been\r\nestablished, and a short distance from the place then occupied by\r\nCorrea. The situation of Coutinho’s establishment did not appear to\r\nThome de Souza to be well selected; and he commenced the projected city\r\nin the place where the chapel of Our Lady d’ Ajuda is situated, about\r\na mile further to the north, against the votes of some individuals who\r\npreferred the site of Montserrat.\r\n\r\nIn the following year a galliot was ordered out, laden with European\r\nanimals, commanded by Simon da Gama; and in the year 1551, the same\r\nsuccour was furnished by a squadron, of which Antonio d’ Oliveira was\r\ncommander: he brought some young females of noble extraction, from the\r\norphan establishment, strongly recommended by Queen Donna Catharina\r\nto the governor, in order that they might be betrothed in marriage,\r\nwith certain portions, to the principal persons of the state. Similar\r\nassistance was annually continued, during the quadrennial government\r\nof the first governor and of his successor Duarthe de Costa. The\r\nJesuits, at the head of whom was the celebrated P. M. Nobrega, pursued\r\ntheir purpose of civilizing and introducing Christianity amongst the\r\nIndians, through the imposing medium of ceremonies, parade, and pomp,\r\nwith remarkable and continued success, up to the period of the general\r\nexpulsion of their sect: and the colonists of Brazil, particularly\r\nthose of this province, are indebted most materially for the reduction\r\nof many of the hordes of Indians who occupied the coast, to the great\r\ninfluence which the Jesuits acquired over them. Duarthe da Costa\r\nwas succeeded in 1558, by Mendo de Sa, who obtained the government\r\nfor fourteen years, during which period this province advanced\r\nconsiderably. He also afforded assistance to all the capitanias whose\r\ncolonization was opposed by the Indians. This province is divided into\r\nthree comarcas--Ilheos, Jacobina, and Bahia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Comarca of the_ ILHEOS.\r\n\r\nThis comarca, which extends from the river Jiquirica to the Belmonte\r\nor Jiquitinhonha, occupies the territory of the suppressed capitania\r\nof the same name, which at first took in an extent of fifty leagues of\r\ncoast, from the embouchure of the Jaguaripe opposite the southern point\r\nof the island of Itaparica (afterwards from the island of Tinhare,) to\r\nthe commencement of the capitania of Pedro do C. Tourinho. Its first\r\ndonatory was George de Figueyredo Correa, a fidalgo of the King, and\r\nescrivam of the treasury (or chancellor of the exchequer.) The public\r\nsituation which he held prevented his going personally to colonize\r\nit; he therefore nominated a Spanish cavalier, Francisco Rameiro, and\r\nintrusted him with the command of an armament equipped with every\r\nthing requisite for the purpose, and which arrived safe in the port of\r\nthe island of Tinhare. Here Rameiro founded a town upon the morro of\r\nSt. Paulo; but, becoming disgusted with the situation he had chosen,\r\nthe colony was removed to the river of Ilheos, where a new town was\r\ncommenced, and received the name of St. George, in honour of the\r\nproprietor. War was maintained against the Indians for a few years, but\r\nbeing a tribe of the Tupininquins, who possessed much more docility of\r\ncharacter than any of the others, friendship was at last established\r\nwith them; and the harmony which afterwards prevailed tended greatly\r\nto the augmentation of the capitania, and many rich men of Lisbon\r\nordered sugar-works to be erected, which produced a rapid increase of\r\npopulation and commerce.\r\n\r\nJeronimo Alarcao succeeded his father, Figueyredo Correa, and shortly\r\nafterwards, by royal consent, he sold this capitania to Lucas Giraldes,\r\nwho expended a considerable capital in its improvement, which was,\r\nhowever, rendered futile in consequence of the destruction occasioned\r\nby the Aimbores, who fell upon his people, killed a great many, and\r\ncompelled the rest to retire to Bahia. Mendo de Sa went personally\r\nto succour the unfortunate colonists, and carried havoc amongst the\r\nIndians, about the year 1570.\r\n\r\nOne of the successors of Lucas Geraldes transferred this capitania\r\nto D. Ellena de Castro, for the payment of a debt; in the possession\r\nof which illustrious family it remained till the year 1771, when\r\nJoseph I. incorporated it with the crown lands, giving to Don\r\nAntonio de Castro, the last donatory, the countship of Rezende, and\r\nan admiralship, with a revenue of five thousand crusades. It is a\r\nmountainous country, almost universally covered with wild woods and\r\nforests, which produce a diversity of timber for building, cabinet\r\nwork, and dye-woods. The frequent rains contribute much to the growth\r\nof the woods, which preserve the soil in a state of moisture. There is\r\nscarcely any situation where mandioca, the coffee tree, rice, Indian\r\ncorn, the sugar cane, and cotton tree do not prosper. They are the\r\nprincipal articles of cultivation. The culture of indigo might be\r\nrendered lucrative, as well as cocoa and _pechurim_. Although the\r\ncountry produces them spontaneously, the latter is not so full grown as\r\nthat of Para.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The serra of Aimores originates in this comarca, where\r\nit commonly receives the name of Itaraca, and sometimes Goytaracas,\r\nor Baytaracas; in many parts it is uneven and broken, in some it\r\napproaches the sea, and in others stretches far into the interior.\r\nBetween the rivers Ilheos and Contas it is parallel with and very near\r\nto the beach. All the other mountains are ramifications of this; and\r\nalmost all parts, particularly the Beira-mar, or sea-coast, are dressed\r\nin verdant woods.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Granite, limestone, potters’ earth, crystals, and gold in\r\nthe western district of the province.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--Amongst medicinal plants are found ipecacuanha, _alcacuz_,\r\n_contrayerva_, (used against poisons,) _butua_, jesuits’ bark,\r\njalap, tamarind, _milhomens_, or basil root, _curucu_, _barbatimao_,\r\n_curcuma_, or turmerick, betony. The gum trees are gum-copal, dragons’\r\nblood, angelem, and mastick. Amongst the trees of good timber for\r\nbuilding are _macaranduba_, _tapinhuan_, _vinhatica_, _loiro_,\r\n_jinipapo_, _itapicuru_, cedar, _pilia_, _hybicuhyba_, sassafras,\r\n_angico_, _gonsalo-alves_, bow wood, oil wood, iron wood, violet wood,\r\n_sucupira_, _sapucaya_, _caixete_, _coroçao de negro_, (negro’s heart,)\r\nand Brazil wood. There are also trees of _cupahiba_, _suma-uma_,\r\ncajue-nut, _jabuticaha_, _mangaba_, the _goyaba_, _araticu_, and a\r\ndiversity of palms. The Asiatic cocoa-nut tree is very abundant in\r\nthe proximity of the shore. The _piassaba_ tree, common in the woods,\r\nfurnishes a lucrative branch of commerce in its flax for cables; of its\r\nnut various turnery articles are made. The _nayha_ tree, as large as\r\nthe first, grows in the interior, and sustains with its nuts a variety\r\nof birds, principally the _arrara_, and quadrupeds; they are little\r\ninferior to the cocoa, the inside being very sweet.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--All parts of the comarca are generally deficient in domestic\r\nanimals; hogs, which are the most numerous, fly to the mountains, in\r\ncertain moons, and do not re-appear till after some days. In the woods\r\nare the deer, _anta_, boar, and other game. The wild dog has been\r\nknown in this district only a few years. The _mutun_, _jacu_, macuco\r\npartridge, and _tucano_ are common; as well as the _arraponga_, and\r\nvarious sorts of the turtle-dove. The _cayrua_ is of the size of a\r\nblackbird, blue on the back, with the breast purple, the wings and\r\ntail black, the beak short and broad; the feathers of the breast,\r\nwhen placed before the heat of a fire, assume the colour of gold; but\r\nthe Author of Nature has not destined this bird, so esteemed for its\r\nplumage, to delight the ear. Various species of bees produce honey\r\nspontaneously, some in the cavities of the trunks of trees, others in\r\nlittle hives of wax which they form in the twigs.\r\n\r\nThe Tupininquin tribe, who possessed the sea-coast when the colonists\r\nestablished themselves in this comarca, (ci-devant capitania,) have\r\nbeen partially Christianized for many years; and, having intermarried\r\nwith the Europeans, a portion of the population exhibit a mixture of\r\nthe Tupininquin physiognomy.\r\n\r\nIn the certam there existed for some ages two nations, denominated\r\n_Patachos_, or _Cotochos_, and _Mongoyos_; the former is at present\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe Mongoyos, reduced in the year 1806, are divided into six or seven\r\naldeias, thinly peopled in their vicinity, and to the north of the\r\nriver Patype. Each family lives in its cabana. They cultivate various\r\nsorts of roots, besides excellent mandioca, and water-melons. They are\r\nvery extravagant of honey in their method of taking it from the hives.\r\nThey clear away all the wax, as well as the bees, which they find in\r\nthe cells, and strain the whole through a sort of sifter; the wax and\r\nbees are subsequently distilled in a certain portion of water, which\r\nferments and produces a beverage, which when taken copiously leads them\r\non from intoxication to fury. They make even a more spirituous drink\r\nfrom a sort of potato, and the root of mandioca pounded, and infused\r\nto the point of fermentation. The fathers give names to their new-born\r\nsons without any ceremony whatever. They weep over the dead, and inter\r\nthem seated in a naked state. They dance and sing to the sound of an\r\ninstrument as simple as inharmonious, and in the form of a bow with a\r\nslender cord. The women wear a well made cotton fringe, which reaches\r\nalmost to the knees; the men a girdle made of palm leaves, and have no\r\nother covering upon their well proportioned bodies. They spend a great\r\nportion of their time wandering in the woods, hunting, and gathering\r\nfruits. The manufacture of earthen vessels is the only handicraft\r\nwhich they exercise. They use the skins of deer for bags. The dog is\r\nthe most useful domestic animal in their estimation, and the only one\r\nwhich they breed for the purpose of hunting. They covet nothing so much\r\nof the Christians as instruments of iron. Their medicine consists in\r\nplasters of pounded herbs, baths, and beverages of others boiled; all\r\nderived from the experience or tradition of their ancestors. The bow\r\nand arrow are their only arms, both for war and hunting; those who have\r\nbeen catechised prefer the gun.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND LAKES.--The most considerable is the river Contas,\r\nprimarily called Jussiappe. It originates and receives its first\r\nconfluents in the comarca of Jacobina. The streams that incorporate\r\nwith it in this comarca, by the northern margin, are the Preto, Pedras,\r\nManageru, the small Area, Pires, Agua Branca, (White Water,) and the\r\nOrico Guassu, which generally traverse extensive forests, exhibiting\r\nfew signs of colonization or cultivation. It receives by the southern\r\nbank the Grugungy, little inferior to it, the principal branch of\r\nwhich is the Salina. The Patacho Indians are masters of its adjacent\r\nterritory. Below this confluence is the situation called Funis, where\r\nthe river runs with divided rapidity, almost hid amongst stones, and\r\ndischarges itself thirty-five miles south of Point Mutta, and about the\r\nsame distance north of the Ilheos. Sumacas proceed fifteen miles up it\r\nto the first fall, where there is a populous aldeia, with a hermitage.\r\n\r\nThe Patype, which has its source in the comarca of Serro Frio, and\r\nthere has the name of Pardo, runs through a stony bed, with numerous\r\nfalls, which renders it unnavigable. Its mouth is ten miles to the\r\nnorth of the river Belmonte, with which it communicates in two\r\nplaces by the channels of Jundiahy and of Salsa, which latter, about\r\ntwenty-eight miles from the sea, divides its waters between the Patype\r\nand the Belmonte.\r\n\r\nAbout five miles from the Salsa is the deep and circular lake of\r\nAntimucuy, abounding with fish, and having two outlets into the\r\nBelmonte.\r\n\r\nTen miles north of the Patype is the Poxim, and about the same distance\r\nfrom the latter the Commandatuba.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles north of the Commandatuba is emptied the Una, which rises\r\nin the Aimore mountains, and gathers by its right bank the Braco do\r\nSul, that flows also from the same serra. Sumacas advance nearly ten\r\nmiles above this confluence, which is about three miles distant from\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe river Ilheos is the entrance of a fine bay, into which various\r\nstreams flow, navigable with the tide for a greater or less distance;\r\nbut the only considerable one is the Cachoeira, along the banks of\r\nwhich is a fine flat roadway, nearly half the distance of its extent.\r\nThe Engenho is navigable for the space of eight miles to the base of a\r\nbeautiful cascade. The others are all small. The bar of the Ilheos is\r\npointed out by four islands; three are very rocky, the other is robed\r\nin verdant woods, and the whole are of moderate elevation.\r\n\r\nThree miles north of the bar of Ilheos is that of the Itahype, which\r\nis narrow and deep, not having more than twenty-five miles of extent,\r\nbeing the outlet of a deep lake of the same name. It is seven miles in\r\ncircumference, and three in width, with a small island, and is bordered\r\nwith woods and forests, from whence issue several small streams into\r\nthis fine receptacle. The spontaneous woody productions of the banks of\r\nthis lake might be conveyed with much facility to the bay of Ilheos, by\r\nopening a canal from the Itahype to the Fundao, and which undertaking\r\nhad, in fact, at some former period been commenced.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of this comarca are to be observed the rivers\r\nMarahu and Acarahy, which flow into the bay of Camamu; the Serenheham,\r\nwhich empties itself in front of the island of Boypeba; the Jiquie,\r\nwhich enters by two unequal mouths into the channel that separates\r\nthe isle of Tinhare from the continent; the Una, which originates in\r\nthe serra of Pedra Branca, (White Stone,) and runs into the sea a few\r\nleagues to the north of the Jiquie; and the Jiquirica, which descends\r\nfrom the serra Giboya, having its mouth a few miles to the north\r\nof the Una. The whole afford only a very short navigation, and the\r\nlargest have not a course exceeding sixty miles, their waters being\r\nprecipitated by numerous falls, and flowing through a country of a\r\nmountainous aspect, possessing fertile soil and forests of fine timber.\r\n\r\nPORTS AND ISLANDS.--The bay of Camamu, at the southern entrance of\r\nwhich is Point Mutta, with a fort, is the only port of the comarca\r\ncapable of receiving large vessels. It is beautified with several\r\nislands, and has numerous streams navigable only as far as the tide\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nFrom the bay of Camamu, nearly to the Una, the coast is bordered with\r\nislands; three of which, only, are of any considerable size, the\r\nTinhare, the Boypeba, and the Tupiassu.\r\n\r\nThe island of Tinhare, better known by the name of Morro, in\r\nconsequence of having a rock called the morro of St. Paulo, is eighteen\r\nmiles long from north to south, of proportionable width, with a fort at\r\nits northern extremity, and near it a povoaçao, and hermitage of Our\r\nLady da Luz.\r\n\r\nThe island of Boypeba, south of Tinhare, from which it is separated by\r\na channel, is six miles square, and has a town on its eastern shore.\r\n\r\nThe island of Tupiassu, ten miles long from east to west, and half the\r\nwidth, is between Tinhare and the continent, and the two branches of\r\nthe river Jiquie.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles to the south of Boypeba is the small island of Quieppe,\r\nformerly fortified, and forming two unequal bars to the bay of Camamu.\r\n\r\nSeven miles west of Quieppe, and almost in the centre of the bay, is\r\nthe island of Camamu, elevated and of a circular form, two miles in\r\ndiameter, and with some dwellers. It is now generally denominated\r\nthe island Das Pedras, or Stones, which are found upon it in great\r\nquantities. They are of a ferruginous colour, and as heavy as lead;\r\nsome have veins of silver, but not sufficient to repay the labour of\r\nits extraction. The fishermen of the southern coast make leads from it\r\nfor their nets and lines.\r\n\r\nNear ten miles north-north-east of Quieppe is the island of Tubaroes,\r\nlarger than Camamu, well provided with water, possessing cocoa groves,\r\nand some inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this comarca are---\r\n\r\n    Ilheos\r\n    Olivença\r\n    Rio de Contas\r\n    Camamu\r\n    Marahu\r\n    Barcellos\r\n    Serinhehem\r\n    Cayru\r\n    Igrapiuna\r\n    Boypeba\r\n    Valença.\r\n\r\nIlheos, or St. George, now decayed, and formerly a considerable place,\r\nis on a plain upon the northern bank of the bay of the same name,\r\nbetween the two small hills of St. Antonio and Our Lady of Victory,\r\nwhich latter is the most distant from the sea. It has a church\r\ndedicated to the Invençao da Vera Cruz, a hermitage of Our Lady of St.\r\nSebastian, near the beach, and one of Our Lady of Victory, upon the\r\nhill of that name. It is well supplied with fish, and the necessaries\r\nof life. The Jesuits had a college here, which serves for the municipal\r\nhouse. The suburbs are agreeable, and the port, which can receive large\r\nsumacas, is defended by various small forts. From hence is exported\r\nfarinha, rice, coffee, spirits, timber, and some cocoa. There are two\r\nroads or tracks from this town, one already mentioned along the river\r\nCachoeira to the comarca of Serro Frio, the other to Villa Nova do\r\nPrincipe, in the southern district of the comarca of Jacobina.\r\n\r\nOlivença, nine miles to the south of Ilheos, is a large and populous\r\nIndian town, delightfully situated upon a small eminence, enjoying\r\nsalubrious air, and an extensive view of the sea, between the mouths\r\nof two small rivers of unequal size. All the houses are covered with\r\nstraw, and its inhabitants are generally occupied in works of turnery,\r\nby which they obtain nearly a thousand crusades annually. The church\r\nis a handsome stone building, denominated Our Lady da Escada, and a\r\nbridge is over the larger stream, which washes the northern side of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nRio de Contas is a middling town, well situated a little within the\r\nmouth and upon the southern margin of the river from which its name\r\nis derived, and that forms a very good port for the reception of\r\nsumacas between two rivers of very unequal magnitude, the waters of\r\nwhich are excellent for tempering iron. It has a church dedicated to\r\nSt. Miguel, and a stone bridge over the larger river. The inhabitants\r\nare obliged by the camara to cultivate, under certain penalties, so\r\nmany feet of mandioca, proportioned to the number of slaves which each\r\nfarmer possesses. This arrangement produces considerable exportation of\r\nfarinha to the capital.\r\n\r\nCamamu is a town in a state of mediocrity, possessing some commerce,\r\nand agreeably situated upon the left bank of the Acarahy, ten miles\r\nabove its embouchure, and opposite the mouth of the Cachoeira, which\r\njoins the former on the right. It possesses a church of Our Lady of\r\nAssumpçao, a hermitage of Our Lady of Desterro, and royal professors\r\nof Latin and the primitive letters. The exports are considerable in\r\ncoffee, farinha, spirits, timber, rice, and cocoa. At this town a road\r\nterminates from the central part of the district of the town of Rio de\r\nContas, from whence proceed numerous droves of oxen.\r\n\r\nMarahu is a small town, well situated upon the margin and about twenty\r\nmiles distant from the mouth of the river from which it derives the\r\nname, and by which small craft proceed up to its port. It has a church\r\ndedicated to St. Sebastian. The inhabitants produce much mandioca, and\r\ncollect some timber. In its district are portions of soil particularly\r\nadapted to the produce of water-melons and pine-apples, which are very\r\nlarge and excellent, and are sent in considerable abundance to the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nBarcellos is also a small town, advantageously standing at the angle of\r\nthe confluence of the small river Paratigy, with the Marahu, ten miles\r\nbelow the town of the same name. The inhabitants are Indians, cultivate\r\nmandioca and other necessaries of life peculiar to the country, and\r\ndress the flax of _ticum_. The church is entitled Our Lady of\r\nCandeias.\r\n\r\nSerinhehem, commonly called Santarem, is a very small town, near the\r\nmouth of the stream of that name, and peopled with Indians, who are\r\nfishermen, agriculturists, and cutters of wood. St. Andre is the\r\ntitular patron of its church.\r\n\r\nCayru, a town of medium size, pleasantly situated upon a small\r\nisland of the same name, between those of Tinhare, Tupiassu, and\r\nthe continent, has one good paved street, with many houses of one\r\nstory. At its extremity is a convent of St. Franciscans; also a church\r\ndedicated to Our Lady of Rozario, a hermitage of the Lady of Lapa, and\r\nroyal schools of the primitive letters and Latin. Some ouvidors select\r\nthis place for their residence; those now holding this appointment\r\nare also judges, conservators of the woods, and preside at a junta\r\ndenominated Conservatoria.\r\n\r\nIgrapiuna is an insignificant maritime town, at the mouth of the small\r\nriver of the same name, between Santarem and Cayru. Its inhabitants are\r\nwhite, cultivators of rice, and other necessaries. It has a church of\r\nOur Lady of Griefs.\r\n\r\nBoypeba, an old town upon the island from which it takes the name, is\r\npeopled by whites, who cultivate very little beyond the provisions of\r\nlife. The church is dedicated to the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nValença is an increasing town, upon the northern margin of the Una, a\r\nlittle above its mouth. The church is dedicated to the Holy Heart of\r\nJesus, and its inhabitants are Indians and European descendants. Coffee\r\nand timber are their productions.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles from the lake of Itahype, and very agreeably situated,\r\nis the povoaçao of Almador, with a church of Our Lady of Conceiçao.\r\nThe inhabitants are composed of whites and Indians, for the latter of\r\nwhom the establishment was founded; they produce farinha and other\r\nnecessaries, and are cutters of timber.\r\n\r\nIn a peninsula formed by the river Patype, near its mouth, and on\r\nthe most fruitful soil, is the large parish of St. Boaventura. The\r\ninhabitants, who are also whites and Indians, grow abundance of rice,\r\nmandioca, feijao, and Indian corn; cut wood, possess some cattle, and\r\nare great fishers and hunters. The water-melons and pine-apples are\r\nhere very excellent and large.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Comarca of_ JACOBINA.\r\n\r\nThe comarca of Jacobina takes its name from the head town, and\r\ncomprehends all the western part of the province, a considerable\r\nportion of which consists of catingas that are not susceptible of\r\nagriculture, but are appropriated alone to breeding cattle. Mountains\r\nof any considerable elevation are rare, and woods are seen only where\r\nthe soil possesses some degree of substance, portions of which are\r\ncultivated with mandioca, Indian com, sugar, legumes, hortulans, and\r\ncotton. It is probable, from the considerable extent of this district,\r\nand the system which the government is now adopting, of forming the\r\nprovinces into comarcas, that it will be divided into two, in which\r\nevent the town of Rio de Contas would be well suited for the head of\r\nthe future comarca. And for the better delineation of the topography\r\nof the country, we will already consider it as divided into two equal\r\nparts, or districts, that of Jacobina to the north, and Rio de Contas\r\nto the south.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--It possesses gold, brass, iron, and silver; saltpetre,\r\nmineral salt, potters’ earth, crystals, limestone, grindstone, and\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The serra of Almas for a considerable space divides the\r\nprovince from that of Minas Geraes.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Villavelha, near the town of Rio de Contas and the Pinga,\r\na few leagues to the west of the latter, the highest portion of which,\r\ndenominated the Morro das Almas, is seen from a considerable distance,\r\nand is frequently covered with fogs. Various torrents, which take\r\ndifferent courses, have their origin in it.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Catulez, commencing a few leagues to the north of the\r\nPinga, extends forty miles to the north-west, and terminates within\r\ntwenty of the town of Urubu.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Montes Altos, (High Mountains,) which abounds with\r\nsaltpetre, is prolonged from north to south, at a distance of about\r\nthirty-five miles from the river St. Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Cincura, which is a branch of the Aimores, extends almost\r\nto the northern extremity of the province, discontinuing entirely in\r\nvarious parts, and serving as a limit to the winter of the sea-coast,\r\nwhen it is there rainy.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Jacobina, is the Morro do Chapéo, (or Hat Rock,) so\r\ncalled from its similitude to a hat.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Thiuba, which possesses gold, and upon whose summit cold\r\nis sensibly felt, is in some parts covered with rocks, in others with\r\nwoods; has many dwellers, and a hermitage of St. Gonçalo d’Amarante.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Paulista commands the view of a plain extending far to the\r\neastward.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Borracha, otherwise Muribeca, is said to have abundance\r\nof brass, also some silver, and is not far distant from the celebrated\r\nfall of Paulo Affonso.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Riachinho is a portion of that of Cincura; those who come\r\nfrom the river St. Francisco, by the road of Joazeiro in the summer,\r\npassing this mountain soon find pasturage for their animals, on its\r\neastern side.\r\n\r\nMonte Santo, (Holy Mount,) so called from a hermitage upon it, has\r\ncalcareous stone; and in its vicinity, nearly sixty miles north-west of\r\nVilla Nova, there is a large rock, or stone, almost all iron.\r\n\r\nThe serra Branca has a spring on the summit; that of Gado Brabo,\r\n(Wild Cattle,) has small streams, woods, and gold, and is partially\r\ninhabited. There are also the serras of Orobo, of Piedade, of\r\nMangabeira, with large woods and plantations, and that of Boqueirao, in\r\nthe vicinity of the river Verde.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The Paramirim is neither considerable nor perennial,\r\ndescends from the Morro das Almas, runs north-west, and enters the\r\nSt. Francisco above thirty miles below the arraial of Bomjardim, near\r\na mountain, where there is grindstone. A little below the origin, it\r\npasses near a large and deep lake with which it communicates, and\r\nduring the period of the inundations supplies it with much fish.\r\n\r\nThe Rans originates in the Montes Altos, and flows into the St.\r\nFrancisco thirty miles above the chapel of Good Jesus of Lapa.\r\n\r\nThe Rio de Contas springs in the serra of Tromba, above twenty-eight\r\nmiles north-west of the town of its name, and passing it at the\r\ndistance of about eighteen miles, takes a course with little variation\r\neastward; and, after flowing a considerable space, receives on the\r\nright the Brumado, also called Rio Contas Pequena, (the Little Contas,)\r\nwhich issues from the Morro das Almas, runs near the same town, and\r\ntwo miles below it forms a fine cascade. Twenty miles below this\r\nconfluence, the Gaviao joins it on the same margin, and flows from the\r\nMorro do Chapeo, a portion of the afore-mentioned Serra das Almas,\r\nbringing with it the waters of the Antonio. Twenty miles lower, it\r\nreceives, on the left, the considerable Cincura, which originates in\r\nthe serra of the same name. We have already mentioned those rivers\r\nthat join it on traversing the comarca of Ilheos, where it enters the\r\nocean. The Paraguassuzinho, the Una, and the Andrahy, confluents of the\r\nParaguassu, which latter flows into the bay of All Saints, originate in\r\nthis district.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Jacobina, besides the three rivers of the same name,\r\nwhich form the Itapicuru, discharged into the sea on the coast of\r\nBahia, is to be remarked the Jacuhype, which rises near the Morro do\r\nChapeo, and runs into the Paraguassu, twelve miles above the town of\r\nCachoeira. In its adjacent territory many cattle are bred, and lower\r\ndown provisions and tobacco are cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe Verde, whose wholesome waters flow northward through an extensive\r\ncountry, partially abounding with cattle, finally enters the St.\r\nFrancisco near the passage from Pilao Arcado.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--Where there are woods a variety of timber for\r\nbuilding is met with, but in this district hitherto little used, in\r\nconsequence of the great deficiency of population. The wood called\r\n_sebastiao d’arruda_ is common in many places. Of wild fruits,\r\nthe _jabuticaba_ which is found in the woods only, and the\r\n_ambuzo_, alone met with in the catingas, are the most esteemed.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--Amongst wild animals, the _anta_, the ounce, the boar, and\r\nthe deer, are the most numerous species, and most hunted. Cattle are\r\nuniversally bred in this district, and would be more than adequate to\r\nthe supply of the whole province, if winter weather prevailed here,\r\nor the thunder showers were regular in summer. It has been already\r\nobserved that the winters of the Beira-mar, or sea-coast, do not\r\nextend more than ninety or one hundred miles into the interior of the\r\ncontinent, where it rains proportionably only with the thunder, which\r\nis generally not frequent, and at times almost fails in parts of the\r\nnorth. The sun is vertical twice a year throughout the province, and\r\nleaves the earth in a state of calcination: a few salutary showers\r\nanimate the soil in two or three weeks to abundant production, and\r\nthe cattle become fat; but the approach of dry weather as quickly\r\ndissipates all herbage, and the animals exist upon the branches of\r\ntrees and shrubs, if they can obtain water; but if the tanks, which\r\nthe thunder showers supply, and the torrents are dried up, a mortality\r\nnecessarily prevails, and large numbers are swept off. Sheep and goats\r\nare not numerous, in consequence of being almost universally deemed\r\nanimals of no utility.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of the district of Rio de Contas, the first\r\ndiscoverers found bones of an immense size, belonging to a class of\r\nanimals that no longer existed.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this comarca are,\r\n\r\n    Jacobina\r\n    Villa Nova da Rainha\r\n    Rio de Contas\r\n    Villa Nova do Principe\r\n    Urubu.\r\n\r\nJacobina is a considerable town, and the ordinary residence of the\r\nouvidor of the comarca. It is situated near the left bank of the\r\nsouthern Itapicuru, three miles below a lake, whose superfluous waters\r\nenlarge the river. It was created a town in 1723, by King John V. and\r\nconsists of one large and good street, and other smaller ones. The\r\nhouses are mostly of stone, and white-washed with a species of potters’\r\nearth, found in the vicinity. It is traversed by the small stream\r\nRio do Oiro, (Gold River,) which is passed by a bridge. The nominal\r\npatron of the church is St. Antonio, there are also two hermitages,\r\none dedicated to Good Jesus, the other to Our Lady of Rozario. It has\r\na royal master of Latin, and had a smelting house whilst the mines\r\nwere productive. In the adjacent country are bred cattle, good horses,\r\nhogs, sheep, and goats. The articles cultivated are sugar, cotton,\r\ntobacco of an excellent quality, wheat, Indian corn, and legumes.\r\nThere are oranges, grapes, and small quinces, which latter are made\r\ninto marmalade, and exported in small cases. Some of the inhabitants\r\nmanufacture earthenware.\r\n\r\nVilla Nova da Rainha, yet small, and possessing no advantages to\r\nwarrant the expectation of its increase, is sixty miles north of\r\nJacobina, and three from the Itapicuru Mirim. The houses are of earth\r\nand wood, and tiled. The church is of brick, and dedicated to the\r\nSenhor of Bom Fim. Cattle and cotton are the wealth of its inhabitants,\r\nwho also cultivate Indian corn, rice, feijao, mandioca, and distil some\r\nspirits from the cane. The orange, lime, _jaca_, mango, banana,\r\nand pine trees are common, as are the _mangaba_, and pine-apple.\r\nIn its district there are many crystals and saltpetre. Ten miles from\r\nit is the arraial of Matriz Velha, whose church is dedicated to St.\r\nAntonio, and is the most ancient in the comarca. The vicar resides\r\nat Villa Nova, and has a coadjutor here. About five miles from Villa\r\nNova is the parish of the mission of Sahy, abounding with water. Its\r\ninhabitants are principally Indians. Our Lady of Neves is its titular\r\npatroness. In the district of Jacobina are yet the arraial of Figuras,\r\nformerly flourishing, but at present of little note; that of Saude;\r\nof Gamelleira, with a hermitage of Our Lady of Graça, near the river\r\nJacuhype; of Joazeiro, more distinguished than extensive and upon the\r\nSt. Francisco, in one of the most frequented tracks from Bahia to the\r\nprovince of Piauhy, with a chapel of Our Lady of Grotas. Higher up,\r\nand also upon the same river, is the parish of St. Joam Baptista, near\r\nCentoce, where much salt is made; St. Antonio de Pambu is much below\r\nJoazeiro; in its district is the magnificent fall of Paulo Affonso, and\r\nthe Primerios Campos, (First Fields,) where there are rich mines of\r\ncopper. The parish of Bom Jesus, or de Xique-xique, is also upon the\r\nbanks of the St. Francisco, about fifty miles above the mouth of the\r\nriver Verde.\r\n\r\nRio de Contas, a considerable town, upon the road from the capital to\r\nthe province of Goyaz, was created by John V. in the year 1724, in\r\nconsequence of the augmentation given to it by the discovery of gold\r\nmines, which some Paulistas made in the year 1718. It is in a plain,\r\nrefreshed with salubrious air, upon the left margin of the Brumado.\r\nThe houses are mostly constructed with earth and adobe, or wood, are\r\nwhite-washed, and without regularity. The church is dedicated to the\r\nHoly Sacramento: it is the residence of a Juiz de Fora, also a royal\r\nmaster of Latin, and was commenced two leagues higher up upon the same\r\nriver, where there yet exists a chapel of Our Lady of Livramento. The\r\ninhabitants, and those of its vast district, cultivate mandioca, Indian\r\ncorn, rice, feijao, and tobacco, for the consumption of the country,\r\nalso the cane, for which there are some engenhos and alembics. Little\r\nwealth exists in this district; those that in any degree possess it\r\nare traders, breeders of cattle, and cultivators of the cotton tree,\r\nwhich is here of excellent quality. The only European fruit is a small\r\nand insipid quince, from which is made a great quantity of marmalade.\r\nThe nearest track or road from the town of Rio de Contas to Jacobina,\r\nnot more than one hundred and thirty miles, is little frequented, in\r\nconsequence of the catingas being uninhabited for want of water, which\r\nis not met with for several days’ journey. The travellers carry it\r\nin _borrachas_ (leathern bottles.) The way usually frequented\r\nexceeds two hundred and thirty miles. In the district of this town\r\nare dispersed various chapels or hermitages, which in the course of\r\ntime will become parochials, namely, in the serra of Montes Altos,\r\nin the arraials of Morro do Fogo, (Rock of Fire,) Furna, Bom Jesus,\r\nCatulez, and one of St. Antonio of Matto Grosso, six miles distant\r\nfrom the town of Rio de Contas, which is constructed of stone and\r\nserved as a parochial for some years previous to the erection of the\r\nbefore-mentioned one of Our Lady of Livramento.\r\n\r\nVilla Nova do Principe, antecedently Caytete, was created a town in the\r\nyear 1810, and is in a situation refreshed with breezes, near a small\r\nstream which flows into the Antonio. It is nearly fifty miles to the\r\nwest-south-west of Rio de Contas. The church is dedicated to St. Anna.\r\nIn the adjacent territory many cattle are bred, and there are more\r\nextensive plantations of cotton than in any other part of the province.\r\nWithin its district is the chapel of Our Lady of Boa Viagem.\r\n\r\nUrubu, yet a small town, in an advantageous situation upon the St.\r\nFrancisco, is ornamented with a stone church of St. Antonio and a\r\nhermitage of Our Lady of Rozario. The inhabitants, having no fountains,\r\nuse the water of the river, which also supplies them with fish;\r\nthey breed cattle, and have some plantations of cane, and raise the\r\nnecessaries of life in such parts of its vicinity as are not deficient\r\nin water. It is about seventy miles north-west of Rio de Contas.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles to the north, upon the same river, is the small\r\narraial of Bom Jardim, with a hermitage of Our Lady of Bom Successo.\r\nThe people who inhabit it breed cattle, are agriculturists and\r\nfishermen. Fifty miles from the town of Urubu is the celebrated\r\nchapel of Bom Jesus da Lapa, but which does not correspond with the\r\ndescription given of it by the exaggerating pen of Rocha Pitta. It is\r\na vast cavern, and one of the many curious operations which Nature\r\nhas displayed in this region, having some similitude to the form of a\r\ntemple, into which it was converted, being interestingly situated in\r\nthe skirts of a mount of rock, about a mile in circumference, upon the\r\nmargin of the St. Francisco. It has an effective chaplain and a good\r\npatrimony. Not far from it there is a small povoaçao.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Comarca of_ BAHIA.\r\n\r\nThe comarca of Bahia comprises upwards of one hundred and forty miles\r\nof coast, computing from the river Jiquirica, which empties itself ten\r\nmiles west-south-west of Barra-Falsa, to the Rio Real, the northern\r\nlimit of the province, and one hundred and twenty miles in width,\r\nbeing bounded on the west by the comarca of Jacobina. The face of the\r\ncountry is varied by woods, small hills, a few serras, and catingas,\r\nor charnecas, which occupy more than one half of it, and where cattle\r\nalone are raised. It is not however without tracts of substantial soil,\r\nupon the summits principally of the serras, in the profoundest valleys,\r\nand in the vicinity of rivers, where fine trees grow, and where (after\r\nthey are cleared away) plantations are formed of mandioca, tobacco,\r\ncotton, and millet.\r\n\r\nThe best land of the comarca is that called the Reconcave, from twenty\r\nto thirty-five miles in width, immediately surrounding the fine and\r\npicturesque bay of All Saints, (the harbour of its capital,) where\r\nconsiderable estates are appropriated to the culture principally of the\r\nsugar-cane and tobacco, productions which in no other province of the\r\nstate are afforded in such quantity; the soil called _massapé_,\r\nblack and strong, is deemed the best for the growth of the cane. The\r\nwinter, or rainy season, commences about the end of March and continues\r\ntill August, with considerable intervals of summer weather, and never\r\nextends to the western extremity, where it rains only with thunder,\r\nwhich is pretty general, and continues whilst the sun is southward of\r\nthe equator.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The principal serras are from the river Paraguassu\r\nsouthward; the most remarkable are the Giboya, the Itapera, the\r\nMangabeira, the Bocetas, the Gayru, the Pedra Branca, and the Cupioba.\r\nOn the left of the same river, at a considerable distance from it, is\r\nthe Camizao, covered with extensive woods, where cotton plantations and\r\nother objects of agriculture flourish.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Granite, argils of different colours, gold, and iron, but\r\nonly in small quantities.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--Of European trees, the fig only flourishes. The mango tree\r\nis very numerous in some situations, and produces fruit in perfection\r\nand abundance; the _jaca_ is very common; the _mangaba_ tree is\r\nuniversally known; the _jabuticaba_ prospers only in the woods, and the\r\n_ambuzo_ in the catingas. Water-melons are generally very large and\r\ngood, but melons are bad. There are various sorts of oranges, the best\r\nare the _embigos_, which have no seed, and those called _seccas_. There\r\nare a variety of indigenous spices and peppers, as well as those from\r\nMalabar; also ginger, jalap, _urucu_, _angelim_, and the _opuncia_,\r\nof which there are various species and names, some are almost of the\r\nform of a tree, and produce a fruit resembling a large pear, with a\r\nsmooth thin skin of a reddish hue, and a white, soft, and cooling pulp,\r\ncontaining seed.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of fine timber, such as the _jacaranda_,\r\n_vinhatica_, _masaranduba_, _piquia_, _sucupira_, _sapucaya_, _paroba_,\r\n_itapicuru_, _sebastiao d’ arruda_, _gonsalo alves_, bow wood, Brazil\r\nwood, _brauna_, mulberry, whose trunk is used in dying, and the\r\nleaves nourish a species of indigenous _bombice_, or silk worm, the\r\ncultivation of which might be rendered lucrative. Amongst various sorts\r\nof palm trees, the one best known by that name is the handsomest;\r\nits trunk is high and of great thickness, very smooth and straight,\r\nwith branches of prodigious size, and growing only in the humid soil\r\nof the woods. There are also the _cupahyba_ and gum-mastick trees.\r\nThe cajue-nut tree is very abundant. The cane, mandioca, tobacco,\r\nand cotton, are the principal branches of agriculture, which have\r\nproduced a considerable diminution of the largest forests and woods,\r\nparticularly in the environs of the Reconcave; the growth of coffee is\r\npretty extensive.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--All the wild quadrupeds of the adjoining provinces\r\nare known here: sheep and goats are far from being numerous. Cattle,\r\nwhich are bred generally in all parts beyond the Reconcave, are\r\nnot, even with the addition of those from the comarca of Jacobina,\r\nadequate to the supply of the engenhos, the usual consumption, and the\r\nfurnishing of ships, in consequence of the pastures being generally\r\nbad, and the frequent want of water. The deficiency is supplied from\r\nthe provinces of Piauhy and Goyaz.\r\n\r\nThe ancient _Quinnimura_ Indians were the first memorable\r\npossessors of the Reconcave, or country surrounding the bay of All\r\nSaints. They were succeeded by the _Tappuyas_, which tribe was\r\nsoon afterwards expelled by the _Tuppinas_, who came from the\r\ncertams, whither the others retired; but they never ceased to annoy and\r\nto afford great inquietude to their conquerors. The _Tupinambas_,\r\nwho were masters of both banks of the St. Francisco, being at war\r\nwith the neighbouring Tuppinas, dispersed them, and marching forward\r\nexpelled the last conquerors of the Reconcave, and compelled them\r\nto fly in their turn to the certams. The Tappuyas and the Tuppinas\r\nuniting, marched upon the Tupinamba tribe, but were effectually\r\nrepulsed; and from that period to the arrival of the Portuguese in\r\nthe bay of All Saints, and their final establishment at Bahia, the\r\nReconcave remained in the possession of the Tupinambas. They were\r\ndivided into various independent hordes and declared enemies on all\r\noccasions to the injurers of any one of them. The same idiom prevailed\r\namongst them, and each elected the most powerful individual for its war\r\ncaptain, who in peace received no superior distinction. They were a\r\nrace of anthropophagi.\r\n\r\nThe only port of this comarca is the famous bay of All Saints, which is\r\ntwenty-three miles long from north to south, computing from the point\r\nof St. Antonio, to the mouth of the river Pitanga, and near thirty wide\r\nfrom east to west. The island of Itaparica forms two entrances, open\r\nto the south, the eastern is about eight miles wide, and the western,\r\ncalled Barra-Falsa (False Bar,) is under two at the narrowest part. The\r\nmargins of the bay are flat, and beautified in most parts with groves\r\nof cocoa-nut trees; the most elevated portion of it presents the site\r\nof the capital, St. Salvador, commonly called Bahia.\r\n\r\nISLANDS.--All the islands of this comarca are within the bay\r\nof All Saints; that of Itaparica is the largest, being twenty-three\r\nmiles long from north to south, and ten in the widest part. It is of an\r\nirregular form, having a bay on the western side, and a large curving\r\nprojection on the eastern, with considerable inequality of surface.\r\nIts soil in great part is adapted for various branches of agriculture.\r\nThe cocoa-nut, the mango, the _jaca_, and orange trees, are\r\nabundant; the vine produces in perfection. It is divided into the two\r\nparishes of St. Amaro, on the southern side, and Santissimo Sacramento,\r\nat the northern extremity; the latter is a considerable povoaçao,\r\nthe only one in the island, and yet without the title of town, also\r\nwithout regularity, but with a handsome church, a hermitage of St.\r\nGonçalo, a fort, a good anchorage place for small vessels, sheltered\r\nfrom the east winds, and at a short distance an abundant fountain of\r\nexcellent water. It has also a whale fishery, cord manufactories of\r\nthe _piassaba_, (a sort of black rush,) and some alembics. For\r\nthe instruction of youth there are royal professors of the primitive\r\nletters and Latin. This island, which belongs to the Marquis de Niza,\r\nand in whose territory the first annual payments in the state began,\r\nwas given by Thome de Souza to Don Antonio d’ Athayde, Count of\r\nCastanheira, and afterwards made part of the capitania, which the King\r\ngave to him, comprehending the territory between the rivers Paraguassu\r\nand Jaguarype, with thirty-five miles of certam. About two miles\r\ndistant from the povoaçao there is a chapel called Vera Cruz, which was\r\nformerly the mother church.\r\n\r\nAbout three miles north of Itaparica is the island Dos Frades, which is\r\nmountainous, and four miles in length; a little to the north of it is\r\nthe island of Bom Jesus, with a chapel of the same name, and another of\r\nOur Lady of Loreto. Further north is the island Das Vaccas, two miles\r\nlong; to the east of it is that of Menino Deos, which is small. North\r\nof Vaccas is the island of Bimbarra, and further in the same direction\r\nthat of Fontes.\r\n\r\nThe island of Mare, whose soil is mainly appropriated to the culture\r\nof bananas, the support of its inhabitants, is five miles long, little\r\nless in width, having its eastern extremity near the main land. The\r\nisle of Cajahyba, three miles long, low, and cultivated, is situated at\r\nthe western extremity of the bay.\r\n\r\nThe island of Medo, which is very small, flat, and covered with\r\ncocoa-nut trees, lies west of the northern end of Itaparica.\r\n\r\nBetween the western side of Itaparica and the continent there are many\r\nislands, mostly small, flat, and uninhabited, in the proximity of the\r\nbar. Those of Cal and Cannas are the largest.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--About three or four miles to the north-east of the\r\npoint of St. Antonio is discharged the Vermelho, which does not exceed\r\na rivulet, and is of very little extent. The road from the capital to\r\nItapuan crosses it by a stone bridge.\r\n\r\nEight miles to the north-east of the river Vermelho is the bay of\r\nItapuan, with a whale fishery. Between this bay and the said river\r\nthere are fisheries which furnish the capital with fish.\r\n\r\nTen miles onward to the north-east is the mouth of the river Joannes,\r\nwhich originates in the district of the town of St. Francisco.\r\n\r\nAbout ten miles further is the embouchure of the Jacuhype, which comes\r\nfrom a great distance, as also the Pojuca, which follows it.\r\n\r\nThe Itapicuru is formed in the comarca of Jacobina, by three streams\r\nof the same name. The southern one is called Guassu, or Large, and the\r\nnorthern Mirim, or Small. It flows uniformly towards the east, passes\r\nthe arraial of St. Antonio of the Queimadas, by the town and arraial of\r\nits name, and discharges itself into the ocean ten or twelve miles to\r\nthe south-west of Rio Real. Within its dangerous bar there is a bay;\r\nthe navigation is short, and only for small craft. Its adjacent country\r\nis mostly of the catinga kind, serving only for breeding cattle.\r\n\r\nThe Jaguaripe, originating on the borders of the road to the mines,\r\nabout forty miles west of the town of Cachoeira, in the situation of\r\nCurralinho, flows into the bay at Barra Falsa, affording navigation to\r\nlarge barks, for the space of twenty miles.\r\n\r\nThe river Paraguassu rises in the vicinity of the serra Chapada, about\r\nthe centre of the district of the town of Rio de Contas. The small\r\nstreams Cocho and Encantada, (Enchanted,) which flow from a lake of\r\nthe latter name, so called from having a floating island, are the\r\nfirst confluents which it receives on the left; the Paraguassusinho\r\n(the Little Paraguassu) is the first on the right. The largest of the\r\nrivers that join it on the left is the Andrahy, which flows from the\r\nvicinity of the serra of Orobo. Not far from the mouth of this river a\r\nsmall stream enters the Paraguassu, which a little above re-appears,\r\nhaving flowed for some miles hid under solid ground. About twenty miles\r\nbelow the large cascade formed by its waters traversing the serra\r\nof Cincura, the Una joins it on the right, being the only abundant\r\nstream that enters on that side, and whose black waters change the\r\ncrystalline Paraguassu to a yellowish colour. The Capibary and the\r\nPeixe enter it on the left, also the Jacuhype, which rises in the\r\ndistrict of Jacobina. Twelve miles above the last confluence is the\r\nfall of Timbora, less than that of Cincura. This river passes the towns\r\nof Cachoeira and Maragogype, and discharges by a large mouth into the\r\nwestern side of the bay of All Saints. The water is excellent; but\r\nought not to be drank till kept twenty-four hours. The occupiers of the\r\ncentral part of its banks are frequently attacked with fevers, which\r\nare often fatal.\r\n\r\nThe Serigy, or Serzipe, originates in the plains of Cachoeira, receives\r\nthe Subahe, which is equal to it, on the left, and, after ten or twelve\r\nmiles more, runs into the bay of All Saints, opposite the island of\r\nCajahyba.\r\n\r\nA few miles to the west of the Serigy is the mouth of the Sararahy,\r\nalso called Assu, or Acupe, which becomes a small stream where the\r\ntide terminates. The Piraja empties itself almost in the middle of the\r\neastern side of the bay.\r\n\r\nNear the extremity of the same side, the Matuin flows into the bay in\r\nfront of the Island of Mare, and has a fine bay within its bar.\r\n\r\nThe Pitanga and the Paranna Mirim also add their might to the waters of\r\nthe bay of All Saints, the first in front of the island of Mare, and\r\nthe other opposite that of Fontes. Rocha Pitta represents them as large\r\nrivers, but they are small streams, and alone assume the appearance\r\nof rivers for the short space that the tide advances. Barks enter the\r\nwhole, and convey from them sugar in cases, &c. to Bahia.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this comarca are--\r\n\r\n    Abrantes\r\n    Aguafria\r\n    Itapicuru\r\n    Pombal\r\n    Soyre\r\n    Mirandella\r\n    Abbadia\r\n    Inhambupe\r\n    Villa do Conde\r\n    St. Francisco\r\n    Santo Amaro\r\n    Maragogype\r\n    Cachoeira\r\n    Jaguarype\r\n    Joam Amaro\r\n    Pedra Branca\r\n    St. Salvador, or Bahia.\r\n\r\nAbrantes, situated a mile from the left margin of the Joannes, three\r\nfrom the sea, and twenty north-east of the capital, is a small town,\r\nwith a church of Espirito Santo. The inhabitants, chiefly Indians, for\r\nwhose ancestors it was founded, are cultivators of mandioca and other\r\nnecessaries of life, and follow their ancient habits of hunting and\r\nfishing.\r\n\r\nAguafria, a small town, ninety miles north of Bahia, has its church\r\ndedicated to St. Joam Baptista. Within its district are various\r\nhermitages; and tobacco, mandioca, the cane, and cattle are raised.\r\n\r\nItapicuru, a small town, seventy-five miles from the coast, and within\r\na mile of the left bank of the Itapicuru, has a church of Our Lady of\r\nNazareth. Cattle forms the only wealth of its inhabitants; and the\r\nriver not being navigable, added to the sterility of the land, there is\r\nno probability of its augmentation.\r\n\r\nItapicuru Grande is a considerable and flourishing arraial, with a\r\nchurch of Our Lady of Rozario, situated upon the right bank, and\r\nthirty-five miles above the mouth of the river of the same name. Cattle\r\nand cotton are its only branches of commerce.\r\n\r\nPombal, originally Cannabraba, and founded by the Jesuits for the\r\nhabitation of Christianized Indians, is eighteen miles from the river\r\nItapicuru, in a district adapted to a diversity of productions. Santa\r\nThereza is the patroness of its church.\r\n\r\nSoyre, formerly Natuba, is eight miles from the right bank of the\r\nItapicuru, and thirty west of the town of that name. It has a church\r\nof Our Lady of Conceiçao, and the inhabitants, composed of whites and\r\nIndians, cultivate the necessaries of life and cotton.\r\n\r\nFurther into the interior is the considerable arraial of St. Antonio\r\ndas Queimadas, situated along the margin of the Itapicuru, with a\r\nchapel of the same name. Its inhabitants are breeders of cattle.\r\n\r\nTucano, a parish and julgado, with a church of St. Anna, is eight miles\r\nfrom the river Itapicuru.\r\n\r\nMirandella, formerly called Saccodos Morcegos, is eighteen miles from\r\nPombal, and has a church dedicated to the Ascension of the Lord. Its\r\ninhabitants produce a sufficiency of the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nAbbadia, a middling town upon the margin of the Ariquitiba, the last\r\ntributary of the Rio Real, is eighteen miles distant from the sea, has\r\na good port where sumacas arrive, that export sugar, cotton, tobacco,\r\nand much farinha. The inhabitants are whites and Indians.\r\n\r\nInhambupe is forty miles above the embouchure, and a short way from the\r\nright margin of the river of that name, with a church of Espirito Santo\r\nupon a steep, having an extensive view; within its precincts there\r\nis a chapel of St. Antonio, and two of Our Lady, with the titles of\r\nConceiçao, and Prazeres. Its inhabitants exhibit a great diversity of\r\ncomplexion, and cultivate a very considerable quantity of good tobacco,\r\nand the provisions of life.\r\n\r\nVilla do Conde, situated at the mouth of the river Inhambupe, has a\r\nchurch of Our Lady of the Mount. The inhabitants, consisting of all\r\ncolours, cultivate mandioca, &c. with some sugar. Tobacco is the\r\nprincipal production; and fishing is here a general pursuit.\r\n\r\nSt. Francisco is one of the most ancient towns of the province,\r\nalthough yet small, with many edifices of stone, and has a church of\r\nSt. Gonçalo d’Amarante, also a convent of Franciscans. It is about\r\nthirty miles north-west of Bahia, near the mouth of the river Serigy,\r\nin a gently rising situation, enjoying an extensive view of the sea.\r\nThe inhabitants are much incommoded by musquitos, and its vast district\r\nhas many sugar works, with extensive plantations of cane, to which the\r\nsoil is propitious.\r\n\r\nSanto Amaro, a large and flourishing town, situated along the right\r\nbank of the river Serigy, twelve miles above its embouchure, two below\r\nthe mouth of the Subahe, and forty north-west of Bahia, has a church\r\nof Our Lady of Purificaçao, a hermitage of St. Braz, another of St.\r\nGonçalo, four of Our Lady, namely, Amparo, Conceiçao, Rozario, and\r\nHumildes; good buildings, and a great number of alembics. The streets\r\nare principally paved, and there is a wooden bridge over the river.\r\nIt is surrounded by small hills. The senate is presided by a Juiz de\r\nFora, whose jurisdiction extends to the town of St. Francisco. For the\r\ninstruction of youth, there are masters of the primitive letters and\r\nLatin, with royal honours. The tide does not ascend higher than the\r\ntown, and the port is at its commencement, from whence are exported\r\nlarge quantities of sugar, tobacco, spirits, and some cotton. Its\r\ndistrict has many sugar works. The communication from hence with Bahia\r\nis short and easy, and the same tide which conveys barks from St.\r\nAmaro, will often conduct them to the capital.\r\n\r\nEight miles to the north-north-west is the parish of St. Gonçalo dos\r\nCampos, whose inhabitants are generally cultivators of the tobacco\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nMaragogype, a considerable town, and advantageously situated near\r\nthe left margin of the Guahy, a mile above its confluence with the\r\nParaguassu, is ornamented, with a church of St. Bartholomew and four\r\nchapels dedicated to Our Lady, with the titles of Nazareth, Mares,\r\nLapa do Saboeiro, and Lapa do Monte. It has royal professors of the\r\nprimitive letters and Latin, a Juiz de Fora, a fountain of good water,\r\ntolerable houses, is encircled with hills and exports farinha, sugar,\r\nand tobacco. In the vicinity of this town there is armenian bole, and\r\nantimony.\r\n\r\nThe river Guahy, which brings the waters of the Capanema, is navigable\r\nfor the space of ten miles.\r\n\r\nThe Paraguassu at this place is near two in width, and from it a branch\r\nruns north-east to the centre of the celebrated valley of Iguape, which\r\nis about five miles long, and of varied width; it is covered with\r\nplantations of the sugar-cane, for the growth of which it is deemed\r\nthe best land that is known, being what is termed _massapé_,\r\nor a black and strong soil, which is, unquestionably, the most\r\ncongenial to the cane. There are nearly twenty sugar-works within\r\nits narrow precincts, the proprietors of which are parishioners of\r\nSantiago, the church of which is a short way from the left bank of the\r\nParaguassu, upon whose margin, not far distant, is also a convent, and\r\nnovitiate-house of Franciscans.\r\n\r\nCachoeira, a flourishing and commercial town, is divided into two\r\nparts by the river Paraguassu; the largest, which is along the left\r\nor eastern bank, has the church of Our Lady of Rozario, a convent of\r\nslippered Carmelites, with a Terceira order subordinate to them, a\r\nchapel of Our Lady of Conceiçao, another of St. Pedro, a hospital of\r\nSt. Joam de Deos, a fountain, and three small bridges of stone over\r\ntwo small rivers, the Pitanga, and Caquende, or Falleira, each of\r\nwhich has its sugar-works, but neither have a course of three miles.\r\nThe municipal house is situated in the portion of the town, which has\r\nnearly ten thousand inhabitants. The western part, upon the right\r\nbank of the river, is traversed by two brooks, and has two churches,\r\nthe one dedicated to Menino Deos, the other to St. Feliz, from which\r\nlatter it takes the name, and contains about two thousand inhabitants.\r\nBoth portions are increasing; their edifices are of stone, and the\r\nstreets paved. Here is collected and embarked the greatest portion of\r\ntobacco and cotton that is exported from the capital. It has a Juiz\r\nde Fora, and royal masters of the description so often mentioned, in\r\nwhich appointments there is not much advantage beyond the sound. The\r\nmain part of its inhabitants are much incommoded at the period of the\r\nhighest floods. The tide advances nearly two miles above the town, at\r\nwhose extremity the river, eighty fathoms wide, with a wooden bridge\r\nover it, begins to have reefs, which form currents of little depth, and\r\nimpede navigation. It is fifteen miles above Maragogipe, and something\r\nmore to the west-south-west of St. Amaro. About two miles to the east\r\nof this town was found a piece of native copper, which weighed one\r\nthousand six hundred and sixty-six pounds, and is now in the royal\r\nmuseum, at Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThree miles to the north-north-east of Cachoeira is the aldeia of\r\nBelem, so called from a chapel, which is the remains of a seminary\r\nthere established by the Jesuits. Five miles to the south-west of the\r\nsame town is the arraial and parish of Murityba, in an agreeable though\r\nflat situation, refreshed with salubrious air, and possessing good\r\nwater. The soil is fertile, and well adapted to the tobacco plant,\r\ncoffee, orange, and jaca trees, which are abundant. It was formerly a\r\nflourishing povoaçao. Besides the church, dedicated to the Chief of the\r\nApostles, there is another of Our Lady of Rozario, both of stone: the\r\nhouses are built of a sun-dried brick.\r\n\r\nThe _jarrinha_, or basil root, is very common, and indigo, known\r\nhere only by the name of _lingua de gallinha_, (the tongue of a\r\nfowl,) grows spontaneously amongst other wild plants to the height of\r\ntwo feet. All the inhabitants of this parish are tobacco planters.\r\n\r\nEighteen miles to the west of Murityba is the serra of Apora, a\r\nmountain of considerable elevation, more than twelve miles in circuit,\r\nand near the road of the certam: in its vicinity is a hermitage of St.\r\nJoze. Fifteen miles to the westward is the small arraial of Ginipapo,\r\nwith a chapel of stone dedicated to St. Joze, upon the border of the\r\nsame road. A lake supplies water to all the living creatures of its\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nJaguaripe is a middling town, pleasantly situated upon the right, and\r\nseven miles above the mouth of the river of its name, and two miles\r\nabove the confluence of the Cahype, which passes it at a short distance\r\nto the southward. It has a church of the Lady of Ajuda, houses of\r\nearth, streets paved with bricks, royal masters, and a Juiz de Fora,\r\nwho is the same individual holding that situation at Maragogipe. The\r\ninhabitants are generally manufacturers of earthenware.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles above the Jaguaripe, along the left margin of the same\r\nriver, is the large and flourishing parish of Our Lady of Nazareth.\r\nLarge barks arrive here with the tide, and export farinha and other\r\nnecessaries to the capital. The margins of the Jaguaripe in all\r\nthis interval, have potteries for earthenware, which constitutes a\r\nconsiderable branch of commerce.\r\n\r\nJoam Amaro, called a town, does not surpass a small aldeia, with houses\r\nof wood covered with straw, but well situated near the margin of the\r\nParaguassu, upon the road to the interior, about one hundred and forty\r\nmiles to the west of Murityba. It has a chapel of St. Antonio, built\r\nof stone, and covered with tiles, which served as a mother church to\r\nthe first inhabitants, whilst the fevers did not compel them to retire.\r\nPeter II. (then Regent,) gave to the Paulista, Joam Amaro, licence\r\nto found it, together with the senhorio, or lordship, as a premium\r\nfor having conquered the neighbouring Indians, who at that time had\r\ndescended to the coast, and destroyed the crops of the inhabitants of\r\nCayru.\r\n\r\nThe town of Pedra Branca is an Indian aldeia, situated in a flat\r\nportion of territory, upon the serra of the same name, and is eighteen\r\nmiles west-south-west of the arraial of Ginipapo. The houses are of\r\nwood, covered with palms, and the church, dedicated to the Lady of\r\nNazareth, is built of _adobe_, and roofed with tiles. The origin\r\nof it was about the year 1740, for the habitation of two tribes of\r\nIndians, one of them being Cayrirys. It is surrounded with large woods.\r\nAnts, many of a very large size, are numerous, and do much injury.\r\n\r\nST. SALVADOR, better known by the name of BAHIA, situated upon the\r\neastern side, and near to the entrance of the bay, (or Bahia de\r\nTodos os Santos,[28]) is an archiepiscopal city, and the largest,\r\nmost commercial, and flourishing in the Brazil, (now excepting Rio\r\nde Janeiro,) and is celebrated for having been for more than two\r\ncenturies the residence of the governors general of this state; but\r\nthe government, with the title of a vice-royalty, was transferred to\r\nthe governors of Rio de Janeiro in the year 1763. This city is the\r\ngrand emporium of all the produce of its partially populated comarcas,\r\nalready described, as well as the medium through which a portion of the\r\nproductions of the circumjacent provinces are exported. Its situation,\r\nembracing all the commercial advantages of its rival port of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, will enable it, in the desirable march of improvement and\r\ncivilization, of which this great country is yet so susceptible, to\r\npreserve its rank, at least of the second city in the Brazil.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly four miles long from north to south, including the\r\nsuburb of Victoria in the southern extremity, and that of Bom Fim in\r\nthe northern, and divided into two unequal parts, high and low; the\r\nhigher and larger one situated upon an agreeable eminence, and the\r\nother at its western base, both without any regularity. The latter is\r\ndenominated the Praya, in consequence of extending along the beach, and\r\nhas not more than one street nearly the whole of its length, almost in\r\nthe central part of which there are five that do not exceed two hundred\r\nand fifty paces in extent. Here is the seat of commerce, containing the\r\nstores of the merchants, and many capacious warehouses, denominated\r\n_trapiches_, for the reception of sugar, tobacco, cotton, and\r\nother exports; also a general deposit for farinha, grain, and legumes,\r\ncalled _tulhas_, where they are distributed to the people.\r\n\r\nThe lower town is divided into two parishes, the churches of which\r\nare both dedicated to Nossa Senhora, with the titles of Pilar and\r\nConceiçao. The latter is a fine edifice with its front of European\r\nstone, and is richly decorated within. Near to it is the dock-yard and\r\nthe marine arsenal.\r\n\r\nThe Cidade Alta, or High City, stands on elevated and uneven ground,\r\nthe approaches to it, from the lower part, being exceedingly steep.\r\nThe situation is commanding. The valleys and _hortas_, or country\r\nhouses, in its vicinity, as well as the various trees of eternal\r\nverdure, give animation to the native beauty of its surrounding\r\nscenery. The houses are built with latticed windows and balconies.\r\nSedans, of various forms, with canopies and embroidered curtains,\r\nare very numerous and convenient in ascending the steep streets, but\r\nattended with great labour to the slaves. These chairs are considered\r\nthe most elegant in the Brazil. A better quality of meat is met with\r\nhere than at Rio; and the fruits are very delicious, particularly\r\nthe oranges, water-melons, and pine-apples, which are exposed to\r\nsale by black female slaves, who are also occupied in the disposal\r\nof _doces_, or sweetmeats, which are made in great perfection.\r\nThis part of the city is divided into six parishes, with the churches\r\nof Nossa Senhora, of Victoria, St. Pedro, St. Anna, St. Antonio, SS.\r\nSacramento, or Passo, and St. Salvador, which is the cathedral. There\r\nis a house of misericordia, with its hospital for the cure of the\r\npoor, a recolhimento for white orphans, and a great number of chapels,\r\nmany of which, as well as the churches, are splendid; they appear\r\nevery where to be the only public objects which engross the peculiar\r\nconsideration of the government and the people; and here, as in all\r\nother places, the respectable parishioners go in short cloaks of\r\ncrimson and other colours about the streets uncovered, begging for the\r\nchurches, with a long wand and an embroidered bag, with the figure of\r\nour Saviour upon it, in their hands. Churches and convents are nearly\r\nthe only public establishments in all towns that are at all worthy of\r\ndescription, of which latter this city also has a numerous catalogue;\r\nnamely, the monasteries of the slippered and unslippered Carmelites,\r\nof the Benedictines, and the Franciscans, which is the most sumptuous\r\nedifice of the whole; the alms and entertaining houses of Terra\r\nSanta, unslippered Agostinhos, slippered Carmelites, Benedictines,\r\nFranciscans, and Italian Barbadinhos; also four convents of nuns, two\r\nrecolhimentos more; and four Terceira orders of St. Domingos, St.\r\nFrancisco, Carmo, and SS. Trinidade.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Ja^s. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  A BRAZILIAN SEDAN CHAIR, & A PERSON BEGGING FOR THE CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits had a magnificent college (the front of whose church is of\r\nEuropean stone) occupying the best situation of the city, now converted\r\ninto a military hospital, with a chapel in the interior ornamented with\r\nmany paintings that represent the life of S. Estanislaw Kosca, and a\r\nschool of surgery. The religious processions and festivities are much\r\nthe same here as at Rio de Janeiro. The palace of the governor on one\r\nside commands a view of the port and the lower city, and fronts into\r\nthe Praca da Parada, the eastern part of which is formed by the camara\r\nor council house. The archiepiscopal palace is of two stories, one side\r\nfacing to the sea, and with a passage to the cathedral, which has a\r\nspacious nave: the chapter consists of eighteen canons.\r\n\r\nThere is a mint, a port admiral, an intendant of gold, a civil court\r\nof relaçam, presided by the governor, at present the Count de Palma.\r\nThis court, created here by Philip I. in 1609, was abolished by\r\nPhilip II. and re-established by John IV. in 1652. There is also an\r\necclesiastical court and a junta da fazenda real, (the treasury,) for\r\nthe administration of the affairs of the province, composed of five\r\ndeputies, viz. the chancellor of the relaçam, the port admiral, the\r\n_procurator to coroa_, (attorney-general,) the treasurer, and\r\nthe _escrivam_, (chief of the treasury,) also presided by the\r\ngovernor; likewise another, called the house of inspection relative to\r\ncommerce and agriculture, with an equal number of deputies, consisting\r\nof two merchants and two planters, one of tobacco the other of sugar,\r\nwith a secretary; the intendant of gold is president. There are\r\neight royal professorships of philosophy, rhetoric, mathematics,\r\nGreek, Latin, &c. but they are far from diffusing the knowledge their\r\nhigh-sounding denominations would warrant the expectation of. There\r\nis also a public library in the ex-Jesuitical college, a printing\r\npress, the only one in the Brazil excepting one at Rio, a manufacture\r\nof glass, and a seminary for the _meninos orfaos_ (young male\r\norphans.)\r\n\r\nVarious forts defend this city on the sea side; amongst which may be\r\nremarked that of St. Marcello, of a circular form, with two batteries\r\nsituated in the centre of the anchorage place. On the land side there\r\nis an extensive and deep lake, which, for a considerable period, served\r\nas a fosse, called the Dique, and where there are many alligators. This\r\ncity was taken by the Dutch in 1634, and cannonaded by a force under\r\nPrince Nassau, without a similar result, in the year 1636.\r\n\r\nIn its eastern suburb is the hospital of Lazaretto, which was a\r\nhouse of recreation belonging to the Jesuits, and where there is a\r\nplantation of Malabar pimento trees, the finest, it is said, in the\r\nBrazil. The suburb of Bom Fim took its name from a chapel of that\r\ntitle, very agreeably situated. About two miles to the east is the\r\nparish of Our Lady of Penha, in the extremity of a peninsula where the\r\narchbishops have a country house, and where there is a dock-yard for\r\nthe construction of large ships. This situation, called Tapagype, is\r\nbeautified with a profusion of the airy cocoa-nut trees.\r\n\r\nIn the suburb of Victoria is the before-mentioned entertaining house of\r\nthe Benedictines, in whose church of Our Lady of Graca is an epitaph\r\nrelative to D. Catharina Alvarez, the daughter of an Indian chief, and\r\none of the wives of Diogo Alvarez Correa, the Caramuru. She accompanied\r\nCorrea to Europe, where they remained a short period and excited much\r\ninterest at the French court, where she was christened, and called\r\nafter Queen Catharine, relinquishing her name of Paraguassu, derived\r\nfrom the river already described. The epitaph is comprised in the\r\nfollowing words:--\r\n\r\n“_Sepultura de D. Catharina Alvarez, Senhora desta Capitania da\r\nBahia, a qual ella, e seu marido Diogo Alvarez Correa, natural de\r\nVianna, deram aos Senhores Reys de Portugal: Fez, e deu esta Capella ao\r\nPatriarca St. Bento. Anno de 1582._”[29]\r\n\r\nThe society of this city is considered superior to that of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, and the families appear to maintain a more social intercourse\r\nwith strangers. Its population may be estimated at nearly one hundred\r\nand ten thousand, upwards of two-thirds of which are negroes, who,\r\nbeing of one nation and speaking the same idiom, with greater facility\r\nplanned their insurrections, which till lately have frequently\r\noccurred, making it requisite for the governors to maintain a very\r\nrigid discipline over them. In the government of the Count de Ponta\r\nan order was issued that no negro should appear in the streets after\r\nAvi-Maria without a ticket from his owner, stating the object of his\r\nbusiness; in default of which the penalty was one hundred and fifty\r\nlashes. This order had the salutary effect of preventing a great\r\nportion of them from wandering into the streets without some proper\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the late Queen and the present King here, in the year\r\n1808, on their way to Rio de Janeiro, produced great joy, and the\r\ninhabitants voluntarily offered to erect a palace at their own expense\r\nfor the royal family, if they would establish their court in this city.\r\n\r\nThe negroes conceived that the arrival of the Prince Regent relieved\r\nthem from the restraints which they had been subjected to; and the bold\r\nand audacious character peculiar to this nation of Africans immediately\r\nled them to the determination of disclaiming the right of the governor\r\nto inflict the one hundred and fifty lashes, now that the Lord of the\r\nterritory was come, and they ingeniously communicated their resolution\r\nto the governor in the two following poetical lines.\r\n\r\n    Don de Terra chegou,\r\n    Cento e cincoenta acabou.[30]\r\n\r\nOn the departure of the Royal Family, and as soon as the fleet had\r\npassed the bar, the Count de Ponta, adopting the style of the negroes,\r\ndirected the two lines below to be posted up in every part of the city\r\nand suburbs, announcing to them that the one hundred and fifty lashes\r\nwere resumed.\r\n\r\n    Don de Terra abalou,\r\n    Cento e cincoenta ficou.[31]\r\n\r\nThe Count de Ponta was succeeded in the governorship by the Count\r\nd’Arcos, a nobleman already spoken of. The rigid and necessary system\r\npursued by his predecessor was in some measure relaxed. The negroes\r\nhad always on holidays and Sundays indulged, without restraint, in the\r\ncustoms and rude amusements peculiar to their native country. In Bahia\r\nthey usually assembled in the praca, or square, in the upper city, and\r\nfrequently selected one from amongst the rest who was dignified with\r\nthe title of chief, and received all the homage bestowed upon a chief\r\nin their own country. A friend of mine, passing on a Sunday through\r\nthis square, observed them going through the ceremony of executing, or\r\nputting to death, white men, which were represented by effigies dressed\r\nfor the purpose; this was intended for the amusement of their chief,\r\nbut that there was some ulterior object in this species of diversion,\r\nmust have been manifest. In the course of a few months afterwards, a\r\ngeneral revolt took place amongst them, in which they proclaimed the\r\nCount d’Arcos their prince, and threatened destruction to the rest of\r\nthe whites. They had already commenced their operations before it was\r\nknown to the governor, and were performing a bloody circuit around the\r\nvicinity of the city, and putting to death all the white persons met\r\nwith at the different hortas. They were, however, very soon surrounded\r\nby the Count d’Arcos, at the head of what force he could assemble, and\r\na great many forfeited their lives for this atrocious and sanguinary\r\nattempt, the consequences of which, had they succeeded, would have\r\nbeen horrible, as they would have murdered every white person in the\r\nplace. Subsequent to this, orders were issued by the government, that\r\nthe negroes throughout the state were to discontinue their public\r\nassemblages on holidays and Sundays.\r\n\r\nA theatre was erected here about seventeen years ago, but the\r\nperformances are not equal even to those at Rio. In the high city there\r\nis a public walk, with a mirador in the form of a veranda, from whence\r\na view is commanded almost of the whole bay; near it there is a pyramid\r\nof European marble, erected in memory of the short stay the Royal\r\nFamily made here on its way, in 1808, to the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of this city stands next in extent to that of Rio de\r\nJaneiro, and the main portion of it passes through the medium of the\r\nEnglish merchants, comprising nearly twenty establishments. Every\r\ndescription of British manufactured goods has an extensive sale; but\r\nthe competition already stated to exist in the capital also prevails\r\nhere, affording these importations to the native dealers much below\r\ntheir value: and the cultivators have another advantage over our\r\nmerchants, in consequence of their being under the necessity of\r\npurchasing produce for the return cargo, bills upon Europe being with\r\ndifficulty or seldom obtained. The reader is already aware, from the\r\nstatement of the productions of the province, that sugar, tobacco, and\r\ncotton, are the principal objects afforded to the merchant for the home\r\nshipments; and as eight-ninths of the cotton, some sugar, and tobacco,\r\ncome to England, we will offer a few remarks relative to the quality\r\nand quantity of each article.\r\n\r\nThe crop of sugar in the year 1816 amounted to thirty thousand cases,\r\naveraging about forty arrobas each case; and the shipments between the\r\n1st of October, 1817, and the same date in 1818, comprised twenty-six\r\nthousand one hundred and thirty-three packages, consisting of the\r\ndenomination of _branco_ and _bruno_ (white and brown.) The\r\nnew sugars begin to arrive here in the months of December and January,\r\nand some few in November. The most desirable months for purchasing\r\nsugar are from January to May, comprehending the summer season, when it\r\nis in an arid state, and the grain thereby improved; during the rainy\r\nmonths the sugar becomes succulent, and the grain inferior; in the\r\nearly part of the first season also, the higher numbers of whites and\r\nbrowns are more abundant, the latter arrivals consisting of the lower\r\nnumbers of both. The sugars are submitted to the inspection of the\r\nestablishment before mentioned, and divided into the following numbers,\r\naccording to quality, colour, and grain.\r\n\r\n    White--The lowest quality is termed _Branco baixa_.\r\n               Second                   _Branco dez_      No. 10.\r\n               Third                    _Branco onze_         11.\r\n               Fourth                   _Branco doze_         12.\r\n\r\n    Brown--The lowest quality is termed _Muscovado brumo_.\r\n               Second                   _Muscovado redondo_.\r\n               Third                    _Muscovado maixo_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, a few boxes of whites are made of a superior\r\nquality, and rated as high as _quinze_, or fifteen. The best\r\nsugar in this market is produced in the Reconcave, arising, as has\r\nbeen before observed, from the excellent adaptation of its soil to\r\nthe culture of the cane. These and others, coming from the interior\r\nto the bay, are denominated _dentros_, and are not generally so\r\nwhite as those termed _foras_, which come from without the bay,\r\nand are produced along the coast. The _foras_ are much softer in\r\ngrain, but, from their superiority in colour over the _dentros_,\r\nthey obtain a preference in some markets; but not for Hamburgh or those\r\nplaces where sugar is used for refining.\r\n\r\nAn average crop of tobacco may be estimated at six hundred thousand\r\narrobas; but in some years it almost fails, as in 1817, arising from\r\nthe continued dry weather which burnt up the plants; and for the year\r\nending the 1st of October, 1818, only thirty-two thousand six hundred\r\nand eighty-one arrobas, were shipped. One-third, and more frequently\r\none-half, of a tobacco crop is rejected as unfit for shipment to Europe.\r\n\r\nTobacco comes to market from January to March, principally through\r\nthe medium of the towns of Cachoeira and Santo Amaro, where it is\r\npreviously made up into rolls. The whole is accumulated in one\r\ngovernment warehouse, where it undergoes a very rigid inspection,\r\nand is separated into approved and rejected portions; the latter is\r\nonly shipped to the Portuguese possessions in Africa, and, since the\r\nabolition of their slave trade north of the Equator, where it was\r\nprincipally used, the price has fallen greatly, and very little of it\r\nis now taken in their outward cargoes to Cabinda, Angola, &c. which\r\nconsist principally of coarse East India goods, a little rum, trinkets,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe purchasing of tobacco is deemed by the merchants not only the most\r\ntroublesome, but the most precarious branch of their dealings. Tobacco\r\nis usually bought before inspection, so that the merchant has all the\r\ntrouble of that operation. The whole of the crop coming to market in\r\na short period, and piled together in one warehouse, produces great\r\nconfusion, rendering it very difficult to get at the lots agreed for;\r\nand when found, probably, only a few rolls turn out good, so that\r\nother lots are to be purchased, and another search undertaken to find\r\nthem, attended with the same inconvenience as the first; and, in some\r\ninstances, an examination of five or six hundred rolls will only\r\nafford twenty good ones. This delay is prejudicial to the interest of\r\nthe merchant, in consequence of tobacco being a perishable article;\r\nbesides, it is of the highest importance to get the shipments to Europe\r\nas early as possible, for not only do the first arrivals sell best,\r\nbut, in the event of a stagnation occurring, the owner being compelled\r\nto retain this article, there is a great chance of its rotting upon his\r\nhands.[32] Previous to the shipments to Europe, the tobacco is opened,\r\nfresh molasses put to it, and made up into rolls, averaging about\r\nfifteen arrobas each. The refuse shipped to Africa is made into rolls\r\nof about three arrobas each.\r\n\r\nLeaf tobacco is a monopoly of the crown. After inspection, it takes\r\nthe approved at a price proportionable to that of the roll, and it is\r\nshipped for Goa. The refuse remains with the planter, who is allowed to\r\nsell it to the merchants, and it is usually shipped to Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe average crop of cotton for four years, up to and including 1816,\r\nwas twenty-four thousand four hundred and forty bags; but the shipments\r\nfor the year ending on the 1st of October, 1818, amounted to thirty-six\r\nthousand one hundred and thirty-nine bags.\r\n\r\nThe books of the public warehouses in this city are annually closed\r\non the 1st of October, to ascertain the crops of produce; but at\r\nthis time some of the old crop of cotton is not received, and it\r\ncontinues partially to arrive till the end of the year. In the month\r\nof February the new cotton comes to market abundantly, and in the\r\ncourse of the four following months the main part of the crop may be\r\nsaid to have arrived, with the exception above stated. The quality of\r\nthe cotton varies according to the place in which it is grown; part of\r\nthat sold in Bahia is produced in the southern part of the province\r\nof Pernambuco, and is distinguished, also, by the term of foras, as\r\nthat of Bahia is by dentros. The former has materially the advantage\r\nover the latter in point of staple, being longer and more silky, also\r\nstronger; but its value is greatly reduced by the dirty state in which\r\nit arrives here, as well as by the frequent tricks of the planters, in\r\nputting seeds, and even staves, in the centre of the bags. These abuses\r\nhave been unattended to, and the cotton inspection of Bahia is almost\r\nnominal; this flagrant neglect of the inspectors, so opposite to that\r\nof every other kind of produce, is supposed to be connived at by the\r\ngovernor, upon this ground, that, if the inspection was rigid and the\r\nplanters were compelled to clean their cotton, they would then send it\r\nto the Pernambuco market, where it would command a higher price, by\r\nranking as Pernambuco cotton, and thus prejudice the revenue of the\r\ntown of Bahia.\r\n\r\nThe dentros, or those cottons grown within the province of Bahia, are\r\na shorter, and not so silky or strong a staple as the foras, and have\r\nanother material fault in being occasionally mixed with stained cotton,\r\nbut they are much better cleaned, and in this respect they have of\r\nlate years improved; whilst the foras have become even worse than they\r\nwere, so that scarcely any difference exists between them as to price.\r\nThe latter formerly sold at from two to three hundred reas per arroba\r\nhigher than the dentros. Exclusive of these two qualities some _Minas\r\nNovas_ find their way to Bahia, and if of good quality sell on a\r\npar with them. The increase of the cotton crops has been retarded in\r\nconsequence of some of the planters, a few years ago, turning their\r\nattention more to the produce of sugar, from the high prices then\r\nobtained for it.\r\n\r\nA very great portion of the cotton denominated dentros comes from\r\nVilla Nova do Principe, in the comarca of Jacobina, a town possessing\r\nvery considerable plantations of cotton in its surrounding territory;\r\nfrom whence it is conveyed to Cachoeira, upon the backs of horses and\r\nmules, in square packages, formed of raw hides, called _malas_,\r\neach containing three arrobas, (96 lb.) two of which constitute a\r\nhorse-load, and are denominated by the Portuguese a _carga_.\r\n\r\nAt Villa Nova do Principe the cotton is sold at so much the carga of\r\nsix arrobas, and varies in price according to the changes of the Bahia\r\nmarket, say from eight milreas upwards the carga, to this must be added\r\nthe carriage to Cachoeira, which fluctuates according as horses and\r\nmules are plentiful, or otherwise, from eight milreas to fifteen the\r\ncarga. From Cachoeira, as has been already remarked, it is conveyed in\r\nlarge boats to Bahia, at a freight of one hundred reas the carga; here\r\nit is put into bags, the expense of which is trifling, for the hide\r\nwill sell for almost as much as buys the material for the bag, and the\r\nlabour amounts only to one hundred and sixty reas[33] per bag, (not\r\nquite tenpence.)\r\n\r\nCotton is planted in the month of January or February, and gathered,\r\nsay the first pluckings, about September. The same plants last three\r\nyears, the second year being frequently more productive than the first;\r\nbut in the third year the crop falls off, both in quantity and quality.\r\nAfter this the plants are destroyed, and the grounds lies fallow.\r\n\r\nSome hides and rum are exported; and the following statement will show\r\nthe number of ships, and the amount of produce they conveyed from\r\nhence, in the year ending on the 1st of October, 1818.\r\n\r\n    ==================+===========+================================+\r\n                      |           |             SUGAR.

maritime towns of the Brazil, and a more\r\nsocial intercourse has existed amongst themselves than at some of the\r\nother places. The city and residences in the vicinity are delightfully\r\nrefreshed by the land and sea breezes, and the climate is deemed very\r\nhealthy. There is an English hospital here, as at the other commercial\r\ntowns of note, but there are generally few invalids.\r\n\r\nHere, as in all parts of the Brazil, the females are much confined to\r\nthe houses, and do not take free and open exercise; their domestic\r\nhabits are slovenly and indolent; many, in the Turkish style, sit\r\non the ground upon mats, while at work; they dress loosely; and to\r\nthe general listlessness and prevailing custom of indulging in a\r\n_sesta_, or nap after dinner, may be attributed the gross and\r\nunshapely appearance of some of the Brazilian females. It would,\r\nhowever, be illiberal to include the whole in this description, as\r\nthere are many fine women, and if better acquainted with the graces\r\nand the refinements of the fair sex, would be ornaments to any circle\r\nof society, having naturally much sprightliness and wit, if properly\r\ndirected, and freed from the shackles of jealousy with which they are\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nThis city, on the 10th of February, 1821, followed the example of\r\nPara, in declaring itself for the new constitution of Portugal, and\r\na resolution to that effect was publicly adopted in the camara, and\r\nsigned by Conde de Palma, the governor, who however declined holding\r\nthat situation longer. This measure was brought about principally by\r\nthe military. Lieut.-Colonels Manuel Pedro de Freitas and Francisco de\r\nPaula, were its most active promoters. It is said, that thirteen of the\r\nmilitary, including a major, were killed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Ja^s. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C.

XVI.\r\n\r\n                    PROVINCE OF SEREGIPE D’EL REY.\r\n\r\n   _Colonization--Reduction of the Indians--Extent--Mountains\r\n   --Rivers and Lakes--Mineralogy--Zoology--Phytology--Povoações._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conquest and colonization of this province was commenced in the\r\ngovernment of Christovam de Barros, deputy-governor of Bahia, in 1590,\r\nin consequence of orders which he received from King Philip II. at the\r\nrequest of the inhabitants between Rio Real and Itapicuru, who lived in\r\na state of great inquietude, as well from the Indians of the country as\r\nthe French pirates, who frequented the coast in search of Brazil wood.\r\nIt was for a considerable period a district of Bahia.\r\n\r\nAfter a century had elapsed, it began to have ouvidors about the year\r\n1696, at which period its diminutive population, involved in anarchy\r\nby a faction of some of the leading persons, disregarded entirely\r\nthe orders of the governor-general. The leaders were prosecuted; but\r\nthey obtained pardon of their Sovereign, upon condition of subjecting\r\nthe Tupinambazes of the country, who had always been a considerable\r\nobstacle to the augmentation of the colony. They succeeded in\r\nsubjugating the Indians in part, and the rest were reduced afterwards\r\nby the exertions of the Jesuitical missionaries, and established\r\nin various aldeias. This province has nearly ninety miles of coast\r\nfrom the Rio Real, which divides it from that of Bahia, to the St.\r\nFrancisco, which separates it from Pernambuco, and nearly one hundred\r\nand forty miles in width, terminating almost in an angle at the small\r\nriver Xingo, about eight miles below the great fall of Paulo Affonso.\r\n\r\nIt may be considered as divided into two parts--eastern and western.\r\nThe first, which is about forty miles in width, is commonly\r\ndistinguished by the appellation of Mattas, in consequence of its\r\nextensive woods, which are, however, diminishing considerably from\r\nthe axe of the cultivator of the sugar cane and cotton tree; and\r\nthe western part, which is larger, has acquired the denomination of\r\nAgrestes, from the sterility of its soil, commonly stony, with few\r\nwoods or fertile lands, and very deficient in water.\r\n\r\nThe Agrestes, if we except some portions, principally in the proximity\r\nof the river St. Francisco, even where there are only small aldeias,\r\nbesides the town of Propiba, and the parish of St. Pedro, is almost\r\ngenerally uncultivated, affording only scanty pasturage for cattle,\r\na great part of which perish from hunger and thirst when the winter\r\nseason passes over without much rain, as in the summer season scarcely\r\nthe smallest rivulet or perennial fount is met with. In the eastern\r\npart or Mattas, where the rains are more frequent, the soil is\r\nsubstantial and fertile, and the country presents a more agreeable\r\naspect of woods and partially cultivated lands.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The face of this province is generally flat, and,\r\nalthough uneven, there is scarcely one small hill or mountain of any\r\nconsiderable elevation; that of Itabayanna is the only remarkable one\r\nbetween the Rio Real and the Vazabarris, and, although thirty miles\r\nfrom the coast, is discovered at a great distance from the sea. Upon\r\nits summit there is a lake that is never dry, and from this mountain,\r\nwhich is affirmed to be rich in gold, various pure streams descend,\r\nforming a handsome river.\r\n\r\nIn the western part is the Serra Negra, little higher than its\r\nsurrounding plains, and the Serra Tabanga, whose base is bathed by the\r\nSt. Francisco, with which it is prolonged.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND LAKES.--The Rio Real, which has about one hundred\r\nand forty miles of course, is precipitated by various falls, and only\r\naffords navigation to the first, thirty miles from the sea; from this\r\nfall, downwards, to which the tide advances, the river is wide and\r\ndeep, but above it is small, and its tributary heads are frequently\r\ndried up. It enters the sea twenty-five miles north-east of the\r\nItapicuru, and receives, in the vicinity of its embouchure, the rivers\r\nSaguim, Guararema, and Piauhy, all by the left margin.\r\n\r\nThe Cotindiba is considerable only for the space of eighteen miles,\r\nwhich the tide advances up, affords sufficient depth for sumacas, is\r\nof great width, has its margins covered with mangroves, and, in the\r\nvicinity of the sea, with white sand, adorned in parts with very fine\r\ncocoa-nut trees. The greatest part of the sugar of this province is\r\nexported by the dangerous embouchure of this river, about eighteen\r\nmiles to the north-east of Vazabarris, the shoals in front of which\r\noccasion a furious agitation of the sea, and it is only experienced\r\nnavigators that can conduct sumacas with safety over the bar.\r\n\r\nThe Seregipe, which gives the name to this province, is larger and\r\nnavigable for a greater space than the Cotindiba, with which it runs\r\nalmost parallel, until united with it by the left margin, eight miles\r\nfrom the sea. In the interior of the country it is inconsiderable.\r\nSerigp was its original name, and which it retained for many years\r\nafter the conquest of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Vazabarris, after a long course, discharges itself into the famous\r\nbay of the same name, and affords navigation to smacks, with the aid of\r\nthe tide, for twenty miles. It is twenty-five miles north-east of Rio\r\nReal, and Irapirang was its original name.\r\n\r\nThe Japaratuba is smaller than all the preceding rivers, and empties\r\nitself by two mouths, twenty-five miles to the north-east of the\r\nCotindiba, and about the same distance to the south-west of the St.\r\nFrancisco. Though the tide runs up for many leagues, it only affords\r\nnavigation to canoes, in consequence of the little depth at its\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nThe Poxim, which rises near the Vazabarris, and runs into the\r\nCotindiba, near the sea, is navigable for canoes, which proceed many\r\nleagues up with the tide. In the vicinity of the river St. Francisco\r\nthere are various lakes of great extent, upon the margins of which\r\nnumerous collections of birds assemble, such as the _colhereira_,\r\n_jaburu_, _sabacu_, _caroe_, _carauna_, and the heron; upon the\r\ncentre of their waters are seen immense flocks of wild ducks, and\r\nthe _mingua_, a species of diver, which conceals the body below the\r\nsurface, showing only its head, and part of its extraordinary neck,\r\nappearing like a snake.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Flint, potters’ clay, lime, and grindstone, a black\r\nferruginous stone, gold, marine salt, crystals, slate, and blue stone.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--There are all the species of domestic and wild animals of\r\nthe neighbouring provinces. The anta is rare; the ounce has almost\r\ndisappeared in the eastern part; deer are numerous, and the red\r\n_guariba_ monkey. In all parts there are great quantities of bees of\r\nvarious kinds. There are many _tatubollas_, or _armadillos_, upon the\r\nleft margin of the St. Francisco, which have been observed on being\r\nbrought to the right bank frequently to die, or never to multiply.\r\nIn the river St. Francisco there is a sort of fishing sparrowhawk,\r\nwhich dives in order to surprise the fish that descend the river; but\r\nwhen the prize is of a weight superior to its strength, it dies from\r\nsuffocation, not being able to disengage itself. The wood-turkey is\r\nhere very common, as is the small _pavao_, or peacock.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--Amongst other trees which afford timber for building and\r\njoiners’ work, are the _sucupira_, iron wood, cedar, _sapucaya_,\r\n_jiquitiba_, _uruçuca_, white and green _batinga_, similar to the\r\nbox-tree, _conduru_, _gaiduno_, _quiri_, _itapicuru_, _pausangue_,\r\n(blood wood,) _juciranna_, _vinhatica_, _ejitahy_, _gonçalo alves_,\r\n_putumuju_, masculine and feminine, _arapiraca_, bow wood, _jinipapo_,\r\nmastick, _biriba_, of the bark of which tow is made for caulking.\r\nAmongst the medicinal plants, there are ipecacuanha, _alcasus_,\r\n_paroba_, Jesuits’ bark, orange tree of the country, _cassia_,\r\nand _sanguinaria_. Orange and other fruit trees are very scarce.\r\nBaunilha is a useful vegetable, and grows here spontaneously, but its\r\ncultivation is not attended to. The cocoa tree is unknown, although the\r\nsoil is well adapted for it. The coffee tree, which is such a lucrative\r\nbranch of commerce to its cultivators in the provinces of Bahia and Rio\r\nde Janeiro, is yet seen in few places, and there scantily.\r\n\r\nUpon the margins of the river St. Francisco there is a tree, for whose\r\nprimitive name was substituted that of _mancanzeira_ by the\r\nPortuguese; the largest do not exceed the size of an orange tree, and\r\ngenerally have many trunks together of little height, with the leaf\r\nlarger than those of a lemon tree, thick, elliptical, smooth, and of a\r\ndark green. In the same tree there is fruit in the form of a lemon-peel\r\nand a fig; but the greater part, and principally the largest, have the\r\nfigure of large tomates, the size of a wild apple, the rind soft and\r\nfull of pimples. The pulp is yellow, of an insipid taste, bitter, and\r\nsmells like a quince. The smallest have an oval stone; the largest\r\nhave four or more: the rind is hard, the kernel white and bitter. This\r\nfruit is not eaten, but is excellent as preserves, made similar to\r\nmarmalade. This tree, which never surpasses a shrub in dry lands, is\r\nalways heavily laden; and the troquaze pigeon and the land tortoise\r\nbecome fat upon the stones, after the fruit falls to the ground. The\r\neastern portion of this province is in part appropriated to mandioca,\r\nIndian corn, feijao, cotton, and the sugar cane, for which there are\r\nnear three hundred engenhos; these are objects of exportation as\r\nwell as hides, flintstone, grindstone, cattle, horses, hogs, and the\r\n_ticum_ palm. In this part there are extensive tracts almost\r\ncovered with a small cane, with the leaves short, not exceeding the\r\nwidth of the wheat leaf, and the knots armed with sharp points, so\r\nthat no quadruped enters or traverses the plantations. The oil of\r\n_mamona_ is universally used for lights, and might become an\r\nabundant branch of exportation. The water-melon in few districts is\r\nlarge or good.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this province are,\r\n\r\n    Seregipe   }\r\n    St. Amaro  }\r\n    St. Luzia  } in the eastern part.\r\n    Itabaianna }\r\n    Villa Nova }\r\n\r\n    Propiha }\r\n    Lagarto } in the western part.\r\n    Thomar  }\r\n\r\nSeregipe, or St. Christovam, capital of the province, the residence\r\nof its governor and ouvidor, and having the title of a city, is well\r\nsituated upon an elevation near the river Paramopama, which is an arm\r\nof the Vazabarris, eighteen miles from the sea, but does not surpass\r\na town in a state of mediocrity. It has a convent of St. Franciscans,\r\nanother of slippered Carmelites, and two Terceira orders attached to\r\nthem; a chapel of Our Lady of Rozario, for the blacks; another of\r\nAmparo, for the mulattoes; a house of misericordia, a good town house,\r\nand a large bridge. All the public edifices are of stone. It has royal\r\nprofessors of the primitives and Latin, and abundance of good water.\r\nThe orange, mango, and banana trees grow in its vicinity. Sumacas come\r\nup the river as far as this place to take in sugar and some cotton.\r\nThis city, which was destroyed by the Dutch on the 25th of December,\r\n1637, eight sugar works then in the province sharing the same fate,\r\nhad its commencement upon the left margin and two miles above the\r\nembouchure of the Cotindiba, where yet are the ruins of the church\r\ncalled St. Christovam. It was removed from thence to a site between the\r\nriver Poxim and the Cotindiba, situated at an equal distance from its\r\nfirst foundation and the place where it now stands.\r\n\r\nSt. Amaro, so called from the patron of its mother church, is a small\r\ntown, thinly populated, and without commerce, although well situated\r\nand enjoying salubrious air, about one mile north of the confluence of\r\nthe rivers Seregipe and Cotindiba.\r\n\r\nFive miles west of it, the aldeia of Moruim, in the extremity of an\r\narm of the Seregipe, is the depôt for a considerable quantity of sugar\r\ncases, and has a small market on Saturdays.\r\n\r\nSt. Luzia, agreeably situated upon a height near the river\r\nGuararema, (uniting itself eight miles lower with the Rio Real,) is\r\ninconsiderable, has a church dedicated to the same saint, a chapel of\r\nthe Lady of Rozario, and exports the productions of the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTen miles distant from it, the povoaçao of Estancia, the most populous\r\nand commercial of the whole province, without excepting the capital, is\r\nsituated in a plain upon the left margin of the river Piauhy, abounding\r\nwith excellent water, and has a chapel of Our Lady of Guadalupe,\r\nanother of Rozario, and a bridge over the river. It is eighteen miles\r\nfrom the ocean, and the sumacas which enter by the bar of the Rio Real\r\nanchor in front of it, and export various articles of merchandise.\r\n\r\nItabaianna, situated in the vicinity of the serra of the same name,\r\nhaving a church of St. Antonio, is a small town, and celebrated for the\r\nrace of small horses, bred in its extensive district, where cattle are\r\nalso reared, as well as various necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nVilla Nova de St. Antonio is agreeably situated, upon an eminence\r\nrefreshed with fine breezes, upon the St. Francisco, on the opposite\r\nside, and two miles below Penedo. It has a good church, a royal\r\nprofessorship of Latin, and in its vicinity quarries of grindstone. In\r\nits district, which extends to the sea, cattle are bred and various\r\nproductions cultivated. Two parishes of Indians are within its\r\nprecincts, with the title of missions.\r\n\r\nPropiha, originally called Urubu de Baixo, created a town in 1800, is\r\ntwenty-five miles above the preceding, upon the margin of the same\r\nriver, between two lakes of great disproportion; the smaller, of a\r\ncircular figure and sixty fathoms in diameter, may hereafter be in\r\nthe centre of the town, when it has experienced that augmentation of\r\nwhich its advantageous situation renders it so susceptible. It is near\r\na valley opened by the diversifying hand of nature across a plain,\r\nappearing more like a human operation, and by which the river at all\r\ntimes extends an arm to the centre of a campinha of more than eight\r\nmiles in length, and of proportionate width, that becomes a large and\r\nhandsome lake, abounding with fish during the period of the floods. It\r\nhas a market every week, where its inhabitants provide themselves with\r\nthose necessaries which the sterility of its environs denies them. The\r\nchurch, which was formerly a chapel of St. Antonio, besides being the\r\nonly place of public worship in the town, is very small and poor. The\r\nwestern limits of its district are the same as those that bound the\r\nprovince. The principal revenue of the camara is the product of the\r\npublic sale of fish, which enter periodically into the temporary lake,\r\nthe mouth of the valley being barricadoed with mats of cane, to prevent\r\ntheir return to the river with the receding waters.\r\n\r\nWithin the district of this town is the parish of St. Pedro, situated\r\nupon the margin of the St. Francisco, in a flat country, and which\r\nbecomes an island immediately the river begins to swell. It consists of\r\neighty families, almost generally Indians, for whom it was exclusively\r\nfounded. The colony is composed of two tribes. The _Romaris_, who\r\nare the remains of the native aborigines, and the _Ceococes_, from\r\nthe vicinity of the serra of Pao d’ Assucar, (Sugar Loaf,) fifteen\r\nmiles distant from the province of Pernambuco. Even at the present\r\nday, they are repugnant to the intermarriage of one with the other.\r\nThe women labour daily in the manufacture of earthenware, which they\r\ndry or complete on Saturday evening, with a large fire upon a piece of\r\nground appropriated to the purpose. The husbands hunt, fish, or plant\r\nsome mandioca, according as their caprice dictates, loitering about the\r\ngreater part of their time, and consuming in _cachassa_ (spirit)\r\nthe main portion of the product of the labour of their industrious\r\nwives. In the vicinity of this parish were found, a few years ago,\r\nbones of a vast size; the species of animal which afforded them are\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nLagarto, situated in a plain seventy miles to the west of the capital,\r\nis a middling town, and famous for its quarry of flint stone. It has\r\na church dedicated to Our Lady of Piedade, (Piety.) In its environs\r\nare raised cattle, cotton, mandioca, &c.; and in its district is the\r\nfamous Campo of Creoilo, eight miles in extent, affording pasturage\r\nfor numerous herds of cattle, and where are many emu-ostriches and\r\nseriemas, with other birds.\r\n\r\nThomar, antecedently Geru, well situated in a flat district, and\r\nenjoying a salubrious atmosphere, with good water, has a handsome\r\nchurch dedicated to Nossa Senhora do Socorro, which belonged to the\r\nJesuits. It is five miles from the Rio Real; and the inhabitants,\r\nprincipally Indians, cultivate cotton, legumes, and mandioca. They\r\nalways select a white man and an Indian for judges.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished and considerable arraial of Laranjeiras, (Orange\r\nGroves,) most advantageously situated upon the left bank of the river\r\nCotindiba, and eight miles above its confluence with the Seregipe, is\r\nnot yet a parish, but in time it most probably will become one of the\r\nprincipal towns of the province. Large sumacas visit it for cargoes of\r\nsugar, cotton, hides, and legumes.\r\n\r\nIn the district of the town of St. Amaro, about eight miles to the\r\nnorth of it, is the arraial of Nossa Senhora of Rozario, which derived\r\nits name from a chapel of this name, agreeably situated near the small\r\nriver Ciriri, traversed by a road conducting to the port of Moruim, and\r\nwhich is one of the most frequented in the country.\r\n\r\nBesides the parochials of the towns mentioned, there are only three\r\nparishes: Our Lady of Socorro, (Succour,) filial of the capital; Our\r\nLady of Campos do Rio Real, filial of the town of Lagarto; and St.\r\nGonçalo do Pe do Banco.\r\n\r\nUpon the coast of this province there are no capes, islands, or ports,\r\nexcepting those within the rivers, the bars of which are generally more\r\nor less dangerous, and afford passage only to sumacas. The men are\r\nof all complexions. The Mesticos are the most robust: of this class\r\nwas Christovam de Mendonca, who, at the end of the year 1806, when he\r\nhad completed his one hundred and twenty-eighth year, still exercising\r\nthe business of a potter in the aldeia of Aracaju, near the mouth of\r\nthe river Cotindiba, gave a relation of the revolt alluded to at the\r\ncommencement of this chapter, and died two years afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP.

A contrary wind prevented our departure for\r\nfive days. The party on board consisted of Colonel Cotter, his lady\r\nand children, Captain Rezende, and Mons. Garay. By way of rendering\r\nour detention less tedious, we made two or three excursions to the\r\neastern side of the bay. Our first visit was to the small rocky island\r\nwith the church of Boa Viagem situated on its summit. We were denied\r\naccess, from the orders of government, that strangers were not to be\r\nadmitted up the steep, in consequence of a new fort then erecting\r\nupon it. We were therefore excluded from the blessing usually granted\r\nat this church to persons upon the point of undertaking a voyage.\r\nIt was formerly the general custom, and is at present not uncommon,\r\nfor navigators and others previously to embarking upon the ocean, to\r\npresent offerings here, receiving in return the prayers of the padre\r\nfor a good voyage; and hence the place is called Boa Viagem.\r\n\r\nThe boat proceeded round this island into the bay of Jurufuba, for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining an additional supply of water. We walked\r\nround the back of the hills that edge this bay to the fountain, where\r\nthe water-casks were filled. Our road led by a delightful pathway\r\nembowered by verdant trees intermixed with orange, banana, and other\r\nfruits. Here and there a house of good external appearance was seen,\r\nand cultivation appeared to be making some progress. We purchased a\r\nrich supply of fruits from a widow whose shacara was well stored, and\r\nher daughter gratuitously presented us with large bouquets of flowers,\r\nwhose aromatic scents were gratefully diffused in our cabin for some\r\ndays. In the common apartment of the widow’s dwelling, secluded in a\r\nprofusion of trees, was the figure of our Saviour, enclosed in a case\r\nwith opened doors, illumined by a lighted taper.\r\n\r\nOur next excursion was to a small opening between two headlands, not\r\nfar from the fort of St. Cruz, containing a solitary white cottage,\r\nexhibiting much neatness at a distance: we soon, however, discovered\r\nthat, like most Brazilian residences, its external appearance was\r\nnot a proof of its internal comfort. There was only one pathway,\r\nconducting from this little _praya_, up a steep rocky mountain,\r\non the summit of which we found a grey-headed old man, seated, with\r\nhis black boy, and enjoying the varied scenery around. He said, that\r\nhe frequently came from the city across the bay in a canoe to this\r\nretired situation. We descended the opposite side of the mountain,\r\nby a narrow and damp avenue, obscured by the meeting of rocks high\r\nabove our heads, on emerging from which we found our progress stopped\r\nby two distinct precipices of granite; it was necessary to cross the\r\nfirst in an oblique direction to arrive at the second, an unlucky slip\r\nfrom which would have precipitated the passenger one hundred feet\r\ninto the sea. We observed a rope hanging over its side, but could not\r\nimagine that it was the only descent into the valley below, until we\r\nreturned to the old man, who informed us that there was no other way,\r\nand sent his boy to show us the mode of descending: with both hands\r\nhe laid hold of the rope, which was imperfectly secured to a bush,\r\nand traversed the first precipice, stepping backwards and allowing\r\nthe rope gradually to pass through his hands. Arrived at the second\r\nprecipice, which was to be descended perpendicularly, he took hold\r\nfirmly of a stronger rope, attached to a hanging tree, growing out\r\nof the interstices of the two rocks; he proceeded backwards, moving\r\none foot after the other, horizontally placed against the side of the\r\nprecipice, till he reached the bottom. Colonel Cotter, Captain Thomson,\r\nand myself, took off our shoes and proceeded in the same way, but the\r\nColonel declined accompanying us further than the first precipice, in\r\nconsequence of a wound received in his hand at the battle of Victoria.\r\nThe valley we found to be thinly planted with mandioca, which, with a\r\nfew solitary blacks and some miserable huts, was all that it presented\r\nto our observation. We ascended the precipices by placing ourselves in\r\nthe same posture in which we had descended, and then returned with\r\nthe rest of the party, who were waiting for us, to the vessel, our\r\nsurprise being mutually excited at the extraordinary and intricate mode\r\nof communication between the two prayinhas. Whilst we lay at anchor,\r\nfour Russian frigates entered the bay, in very fine order, and took\r\ntheir stations not far from the British ships of war, the Superb and\r\nVengeur, then in the bay. The Russian frigates were proceeding upon a\r\nvoyage of discovery to the South Seas. On our departure from the bay\r\nof Rio de Janeiro we had a favourable breeze, and in five days were in\r\nthe latitude of Bahia, having run upwards of ten degrees of latitude,\r\nand seven of longitude. The wind now became adverse; but in five days\r\nafterwards we passed Cabo Calor, Rio Real, and Seregipe d’ el Rey, and\r\non the following day were close in with land, northward of the St.\r\nFrancisco. The coast was flat and covered with woods, a few huts being\r\nall that we could occasionally discover.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Ja^s. Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  A JANGADA OR CATAMARAN NEAR PERNAMBUCO.]\r\n\r\nThe currents we found setting in towards the coast much stronger and\r\nto a more considerable degree, than any of the charts extant account\r\nfor. In the course of the 3d of December we indistinctly perceived some\r\ncatamarans near the beach, and at dusk discovered Cape St. Augustine,\r\naffording us the hope of reaching Pernambuco next morning. At day-break\r\non the 4th, Cape St. Augustine, Pernambuco, and Ollinda, were in view,\r\nwith the land of the Cape elevated and jutting out into the sea, but\r\npresenting nothing remarkable. The coast near Pernambuco is flat,\r\nexcept some elevations in the distant back ground, and Ollinda situated\r\nupon an accumulation of rising eminences. On viewing it we could\r\nnot but acquiesce in the exclamation of the first donatory of this\r\nprovince, “_O que linda situacam para fundar huma villa_.”[34]\r\nThe whole country from the sea appeared richly wooded and interspersed\r\nwith the cocoa-nut tree, and impressed the idea of fertility and\r\ncultivation. The jangadas, or catamarans, now passed near us on all\r\nsides, with their triangular sails, producing no inconsiderable\r\nsurprise amongst the whole party. They are constructed of eight, ten,\r\nand some of twelve trunks of the buoyant _jangada_ tree, rudely\r\nsecured together by wooden bolts passing horizontally through the\r\nwhole, and with cross-bars at the top, attaching the rafts more firmly\r\ntogether. The trunks are not of uniform length, and, being almost hid\r\namongst the waves, would not be discovered at all without the sail and\r\nthe two men who navigate them. The waves pass through the apertures\r\nbetween each trunk, and the men are constantly standing in water, one\r\nof whom steers with a large paddle passed indiscriminately between the\r\nends of two of the rafts. Thus cotton and sugar from the places upon\r\nthe coast and from the rivers are conveyed to the capital. Voyages of\r\nseveral hundred miles are performed by jangadas. An English gentleman\r\nproceeded to sea in one of them from Parahiba to Pernambuco, a small\r\ntable was attached to the rafts upon which he slept, and although the\r\nsea is generally washing over them they are never known to upset.\r\nOur voyage had been an extremely pleasant one, and each individual\r\nhad expressed the highest gratification not only at the mutual good\r\nhumour that had prevailed, but the very great attention of the\r\ncaptain. The party frequently met on shore afterwards, and I received\r\nmany civilities from Colonel Cotter and his lady during my stay at\r\nPernambuco. The Colonel, before my departure, was appointed to the\r\ncommand of the militia regiments formed by the population of the town.\r\nWe will defer speaking of the city of Pernambuco, or Recife, till we\r\nhave concluded the description of the province.\r\n\r\nThis province was presented as a captaincy, with less extent of\r\nterritory than it now contains, to Duarthe Coelho Pereyra, in reward\r\nfor having repulsed the French from the river St. Cruz, re-establishing\r\nthe factory which had been destroyed by them, and rendering other\r\nimportant services to the Portuguese government. The letter of donation\r\nwas granted to him in 1534; and in the following year he set sail from\r\nPortugal, accompanied by his wife and some other families, who joined\r\nhim for the purpose of colonization.[35]\r\n\r\nThe small village of Hyguarassu, which had its origin about four years\r\nbefore, was for some time the place of his residence, till Ollinda was\r\nbegun, which he made his capital soon after its foundation. He was\r\nengaged in continued wars with the _Cahetes_, who were the former\r\ninhabitants of the country. He died in the year 1554, leaving his wife,\r\nD. Brittes d’Albuquerque, in trust of the government of the captaincy\r\ntill the arrival of his hereditary son Duarthe Coelho d’Albuquerque,\r\nwho was pursuing his studies in Portugal, and which he left in 1560 by\r\norders of Queen Catharine, to protect the colony from the danger with\r\nwhich it was threatened by the revolt of some tribes of Indians whom\r\nhis father had reduced to obedience.\r\n\r\nThe new donatory took with him his brother Jorge d’Albuquerque Coelho,\r\nand was accompanied by many friends and hired attendants to his new\r\nsettlement, and had the promise of others to follow him for the purpose\r\nof augmenting the colony. He subjugated the whole nation of the Cahetes\r\nand divided them into hordes; and after a residence of many years\r\nreturned to Europe, in order to accompany D. Sebastiano in his voyage\r\nto Africa, leaving his brother administrator of the captaincy, which\r\nprogressively improved under his management.\r\n\r\nIn failure of male issue he was succeeded by his brother Jorge\r\nd’Albuquerque Coelho, father of Duarthe d’Albuquerque Coelho, who in\r\nthe second year after the Dutch had possession of the captaincy arrived\r\nthere with the Count Banholo, where he remained till the end of 1638,\r\nwhen he returned to Portugal. During his residence he kept a diary of\r\nthe first eight years of the war.[36]\r\n\r\nDuarthe d’Albuquerque Coelho had an only daughter, married to the Count\r\nde Vimiozi D. Miguel de Portugal, but neither he nor his heirs received\r\nany revenue from the captaincy, the dominion of which was disputed;\r\nfor King John IV. who had expended large sums in its restoration,\r\nfinding that the donatory had not forces sufficient to prevent the\r\ninvasion of the enemy, should they make a second attempt, annexed the\r\ncaptaincy to the crown in the first year of its restoration. This the\r\ndonatory opposed, and his heirs sustained an obstinate suit at law\r\nfor many years, obtaining various sentences in their favour, which\r\nwere always abrogated, till finally they desisted from the contest,\r\nsurrendering whatever right they had to the province; and, in 1717, by\r\nthe intervention and consent of John V. a convention was made between\r\nthe Count de Vimiozi D. Francisco de Portugal and the attorney-general,\r\nin which it was agreed that the Count should receive in exchange for\r\nthe captaincy the marquisate of Vallenca for himself and his son,\r\nthe countship to pass to his son and grandson, and eighty thousand\r\ncrusades, to be paid from the revenues of the province in ten years at\r\nequal payments.\r\n\r\nThe new colonists, who were sent to it immediately after the\r\nrestoration of the province, gave it a rapid improvement. The Indians\r\nliving towards the interior, the principal of whom were Tupinambas,\r\nand divided into numerous tribes, were by degrees surrendering the\r\ncountry and allying themselves to the conquerors, or retiring to the\r\nwestern districts. The latter were reduced about the years 1802 and\r\n1803.\r\n\r\nThese Indians were divided into four nations, who have always exhibited\r\nthe most irreconcileable hatred to each other, and to this day preserve\r\ntheir ancient animosity undiminished. They were distinguished by the\r\nappellations of _Pipipan_, _Choco_, _Uman_, and _Vouvé_. The language\r\nof each differed in idiom, but the general resemblance between them\r\nsufficiently demonstrated that they sprung from the same origin. They\r\noccupied a wild and uncultivated tract of country, of thirty square\r\nleagues, between the rivers Moxoto and Pajehu, near to the serra of\r\nArarippa, a country sterile and deficient in water. All are wandering\r\ntribes, ignorant of any kind of agriculture, and support themselves on\r\nwild fruits, honey, and game; a hog, a deer, or a bird are all dressed\r\nwith the hair, feathers, and intestines. The arms of the men are a bow\r\nand arrow, and they go perfectly naked. The women cover themselves with\r\na small and elastic net, or with a deep fringe of thick thread much\r\ntwisted, and made with considerable ingenuity. They inter their dead\r\nin a bent posture, having no instruments to make a grave sufficiently\r\nlarge to admit of the body lying at full length. They always bury under\r\nthe most shady tree, preferring the _ambuzo_, if it be found near the\r\nspot. Of all savage nations they are perhaps the most remarkable for\r\nconjugal fidelity; polygamy and adultery are unknown among them, and\r\nthe latter crime they abominate in their conquerors.\r\n\r\nAll these savages received baptism; and, after being formed into\r\nvillages and rendered rather more civilized, they began to cultivate\r\nthe most necessary provisions of life, as mandioca, Indian corn,\r\ngourds, and vegetables. But, notwithstanding their apparent\r\nimprovement, they still retained their wild and savage propensities for\r\nhunting and general depredation: early accustomed to live on plunder,\r\nthey conceived they had a natural right to the property of each other,\r\nand they frequently drove off and appropriated the sheep and oxen of\r\nthe neighbouring farmers. Independently of these savage propensities to\r\na wild and predatory life, their religious instructors gave them a very\r\ngood character for innocence of general manners, in which they were\r\nsaid to resemble the primitive Christians.\r\n\r\nThey suppose, from the above circumstances, that the present race of\r\nthese Indians are descendants of some who, after having settled in the\r\nvillages and become Christians, had again returned to their native\r\nwilds; and, from a rooted propensity, which no art could remove,\r\npreferred the savage to the civilized state. Indeed, the opinion is\r\nsupported by a fact, already alleged in this work, as well as by recent\r\noccurrences, in which individuals who have been civilized, on entering\r\ntheir native wilds, have again adopted their former rude habits.\r\n\r\nThis province of Pernambuco, which had formerly the title of countship,\r\nis bounded on the north by the provinces of Parahiba, Siara, and\r\nPiauhy; on the south by the river St. Francisco, which separates it\r\nfrom Seregipe and Bahia, and by the Carinhenha, which divides it from\r\nMinas Geraes; on the west by the province of Goyaz; and on the east by\r\nthe ocean, with seventy leagues of coast from the river St. Francisco\r\nto the river Goyanna.\r\n\r\nThe river Pajehu, which rises in the serra of the Cayriris, and empties\r\nitself into the St. Francisco thirty leagues above the fall of Paulo\r\nAffonso, divides it into two parts--eastern and western; the latter\r\nforming an ouvidoria, which comprehends a great portion of the eastern,\r\nthe sea-coast of which is divided into three comarcas, Northern or\r\nOlinda, Central or Recife, Southern or the Alagoas, whose common limits\r\nare in the vicinity of Rio Una, which enters the sea forty miles south\r\nof Cape St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nThis province lies between 7° and 15° south latitude, having a warm\r\nclimate and pure air. The lands upon the whole extent of the sea-coast\r\nare low, with considerable portions of fruitful soil, and although it\r\nhas many rivers, which are perennial and abundant, yet the inhabitants\r\nin many parts suffer from want of water. In the interior of the\r\nprovince the face of the country is very unequal, being in some places\r\nmountainous, and very deficient in water, and that which is met with,\r\nbesides being extremely scarce, is never pure, being of the colour of\r\nmilk, and drawn from wells where all kinds of animals go to drink, or\r\nelse from pits dug in the sand. From the town of Penedo to the bar of\r\nRio Grande, which travellers by the windings of the river compute at\r\nfive hundred miles, there does not run towards the river St. Francisco\r\na single stream in the dry season.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The serra of Borborema, which is the most majestic in the\r\nBrazil, has its commencement near the sea, in the province of Rio\r\nGrande, and, after having traversed that of Parahiba from north-east\r\nto south-west, turns to the west, separating the western part of\r\nPernambuco from the preceding, and from Siara for a considerable space.\r\nIt then inclines to the north, dividing the last from the province of\r\nPiauhy, varying frequently in altitude and name to its termination,\r\nwhere it is denominated Hibiapaba, in view of the coast between the\r\nrivers Camucim and Paranahiba. In some parts it is rocky, in others\r\nbare and barren, but the principal part is covered with beautiful\r\nwoods, nourished by strong and fertile soils. In some places it has two\r\nor three leagues of luxuriant herbage on its summit.\r\n\r\nThe mountain Araripe, which is a portion of it, commands a view of\r\nthe river St. Francisco, at a distance of more than thirty leagues.\r\nIn this mountain the rivers Jaguariba and Piranhas have their origin,\r\nand run to the north. It also gives birth to the rivers Parahiba and\r\nCapibaribe, which flow eastward, and likewise to the Moxoto and the\r\nPajehu, which direct their course to the south.\r\n\r\nAbout seven leagues distant from the fall of Paulo Affonso, in the\r\nparish of Tarcaratu, is the mountain of Agua-Branca, with its numerous\r\nbranches, in great part covered with wild and luxuriant woods. Here\r\nis a chapel of Our Lady of Conceiçao, and many families of different\r\nshades of complexion, equally if not more barbarous than the ancient\r\npossessors of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the river Pajehu, about fifteen leagues from that\r\nwhich absorbs it, is the serra Negra, which is about a league long,\r\nand proportionably wide, and covered with thick woods, that are often\r\nviolently agitated by strong winds. Near it is the site of Jacare,\r\nwhere the Choco Indians lived for some time; but since they have been\r\nsubjugated, like their neighbours, there is little mention made of them.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the source of the river Una, is the serra\r\nGaranhuns. It is covered with woods, where they are introducing\r\nplantations of cotton, Indian corn, mandioca, vegetables, and fruits.\r\nFrom this mountain descend many clear streams of water, which vanish on\r\nentering the sandy plains that encompass it below. Among other useful\r\nplants may be remarked the _terminalia_, or _styrax_ of Linnæus, which\r\nproduces the gum-resinous drug called benzoin.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Russas, two leagues long, and of small width, is situated\r\nabout sixteen leagues distant from the Recife, in the road which leads\r\ntowards the certam of the river St. Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe serra Sellada is four leagues to the south-west of Cape St.\r\nAugustine, and little more than two from the sea; and, although of\r\ntrifling height, is the best land-mark for sailors in these latitudes.\r\n\r\nFour leagues to the north-west of Caninde, an insignificant and\r\nill-situated village, on the left bank of the St. Francisco, is\r\nthe serra of Olho d’Agua, with a circuit of two leagues, and of\r\nconsiderable height. From its summit is discovered a vast chain of\r\ninferior mountains on all sides, and at a distance of about six\r\nleagues to the west-north-west is seen a column of vapour rising from\r\nthe cataract of Paulo Affonso, similar to the smoke of a conflagration.\r\nFormerly this mountain abounded with numerous tigers, in consequence of\r\nthe multitude of caverns within the jetting rocks and frowning crags\r\nthat compose it. Even at present they are the retreats of a formidable\r\nspecies of bat, which proves very destructive to cattle.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Priaca is about eight leagues to the north-west of the\r\ntown of Penedo. That of Pao d’Assucar is within sight of the former,\r\nand near the river St. Francisco. On the southern skirts of the serra\r\nof Pao d’Assucar there is a lake, where bones of an enormous size have\r\nbeen found; and on its northern side there is a most terrific cavern.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Poco, situated fifteen leagues distant from the last,\r\ntowards the interior of the province, is covered with woods where trees\r\nof the finest timber are produced, some of whose trunks exude precious\r\nresins, and oily or balsamic liquors, while the hollow trunks of others\r\nserve for the hives of various kinds of bees.\r\n\r\nComenaty is one of the largest mountains in the interior. It abounds\r\nwith extensive woods in many parts, where the Indians and other\r\ninhabitants of the parish of Aguas Bellas have introduced large\r\nplantations of cotton and mandioca.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Barriga is about four leagues distant from the town\r\nof Anadia, and twenty from the sea, and is subject to frequent\r\nthunderstorms. The occasional and loud noises from its cavities\r\nterrify the people of the circumjacent country, and indicate that it\r\nhas minerals. On its extreme skirts was the fatal band of Africans,\r\ncalled the _Quilombo dos Palmares_, commenced by three hundred\r\nand forty negroes of Guinea, on the occasion of the Dutch disembarking\r\nat Pernambuco. They were joined by many others from the neighbouring\r\nprovinces, and founded the above village, which took the name of\r\nPalmares from the number of palm trees which the negroes had planted\r\naround it. The village, which was more than a league in extent, was\r\nencompassed by a square, consisting of two orders or rows of enclosures\r\nof palisadoes, formed of large high trunks of the strongest and most\r\ndurable wood the country afforded. At equal distances were three strong\r\ndoors, each having its platform above, and defended by two hundred\r\nmen in times of assault; the whole flanked by various bulwarks of the\r\nsame fabric as the walls. Its population amounted to twenty thousand,\r\none-half of whom were capable of taking up arms. They had established\r\nan elective and monarchical form of government. The chief was\r\nentitled Zumbe, and had his palace more distinguished than the houses\r\nof his vassals, which were erected according to the African mode.\r\nThe most valorous and wise were always selected for this important\r\noffice. Besides the superior, they had subordinate officers for the\r\nadministration of justice, which was punctually executed against\r\nadulterers, homicides, and thieves.\r\n\r\nThe slaves who voluntarily came and associated with them had their\r\nliberty immediately granted, but those taken by force remained\r\ncaptives. The first incurred the penalty of death if they fled and\r\nwere taken, a punishment which deserters from the latter class did\r\nnot experience. Independently of a slight covering the whole were in\r\na state of nudity, except the superiors, who wore such clothes for\r\ndresses as the neighbouring people of Quilombo sold to them, together\r\nwith arms and ammunition, in exchange for provisions. Those only who\r\nhad been baptized assumed the name of Christians.\r\n\r\nWithin the square was a vast basin or tank of soft water, well stored\r\nwith fish, and a high rock, which served them for a watch-tower, from\r\nwhence they could discover the country all round to a great extent,\r\nand could observe the approach of the enemy. The suburbs were covered\r\nwith plantations of necessary provisions, to protect which there were\r\nvarious hamlets, called mocambos, governed by veteran soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary that this colony gave much anxiety to the crown,\r\nexisted for the space of sixty years, and cost much labour to an army\r\nof eight thousand men for many months to accomplish its extinction in\r\n1697.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Gold, amianthus, stone for water-filters, limestone and\r\ngrindstone, _terra de cores_, a sort of plaster for figures, also two\r\nor three species of rude marble, and potters’ earth.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--All the domestic animals of Spain are bred here. Goats\r\nand sheep are less profitable than in the country in which they\r\nare natives. The woods abound with all the species of wild animals\r\ndescribed in the preceding provinces, excepting the wild dog, in\r\nplace of which there is the ferret. The hedge-hog has here the name\r\nof _quandu_. The _guariba_, a species of monkey generally of a red\r\ncolour, from the river St. Francisco towards the south, is black in\r\nthis province, and its skin on this account is more esteemed. The\r\n_tatubola_, or armadillo, and the land-tortoise are numerous, as well\r\nas the _moco_, in rocks and stony grounds. Rabbits are very rare. In\r\nthe open country are the emu-ostrich and the _seriema_. In the lakes\r\nare the _colhereira_, _jaburu_, goose, grey and white heron, wild\r\nduck, _soco_, _macarico_, water hen. In the woods and plains are the\r\n_jacu_, _mutun_, _zabele_, _enapupe_, _racuan_, _arara_, parrot, the\r\n_uru_ which is a species of small partridge, going always in bands and\r\nupon the ground. The bird here called _rouxinol_, or the nightingale,\r\nis very different in its song and plumage from that of Europe. The\r\n_araponga_ pours its simple and tender song from the summit of the\r\nhighest trees. The white-winged dove always avoids strange birds, like\r\nother species of its kind. Various sorts of kites and hawks make war\r\nupon the other birds. The _jacurutu_, which is of a large size, has two\r\ngreat horns of feathers, and kills the largest snakes with caution and\r\nmuch dexterity in order to avoid being stung by them. In almost all the\r\nrivers there are otters, and no lake is without the alligator.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--The cedar, bow-wood, _vinhatica_, of various colours, the\r\nyellow and dark are the most esteemed; the _conduru_, which is red;\r\n_barabu_, male and female, more or less of a violet or purple colour;\r\n_pau santo_, waved with violet; _sucupira_ and _brahuna_, both of a\r\nblackish colour. The _sapucaya_ affords good masts of a small size,\r\nand its towy rind is used by the caulkers. The red _camacary_, _pau\r\nd’alho_, _maçaranduba_, _angico_, _coraçao de negro_, the pith or heart\r\nof which is black and hard: there are many others of fine timber for\r\nbuilding. The Brazil wood comes thirty leagues from the interior of\r\nthe country; here is also the cassia, the _carahiba_, whose flower is\r\nyellow and rather large, constituting delicious food for the deer. This\r\nanimal, generally feeding beneath the tree upon them, thus becomes an\r\neasy prey to the hunter. Amongst the fruit trees and shrubs of the\r\nwoods are the _ambuzo_, the _cajue_, the _araçaza_, the _jabuticaba_,\r\nthe _mandupussa_, the fruit of which is yellow and grows also round the\r\ntrunk, like the preceding; the _muricy_; the _cambuhy_ is a large tree\r\nand its fruit about the size of a sour cherry, either red or purple;\r\nthe _piky_ affords a fruit, from the stone of which is extracted a\r\nkind of hard tallow that is used for making imitation candles; the\r\n_issicariba_, which produces gum-mastick, ipecacuanha, and some species\r\nof inferior _quina_, or Jesuit’s bark, to which they give this name;\r\nthe real one is to be found in the serra Cayriris. The _maçanzeira_ is\r\ncommon in some districts of this province, where it has the improper\r\nname of _murta_.\r\n\r\nThe comarca of the Alagoas produces great abundance of the best timber\r\nin the province; there the canoes are made in which the St. Francisco\r\nis navigated. Cocoa-nut tree groves abound in the vicinity of the\r\nsea. The _mamona_ is carefully cultivated in some districts, and\r\nits oil affords an article of exportation. The _opuncia_, or\r\n_palmatoria_, is here very common; and the cochineal insect might\r\nbe cultivated with advantage.\r\n\r\nThe cotton tree and sugar cane are the principal branches of\r\nagriculture, and their productions are the most lucrative. The desire\r\nevery where of the gain which these two articles afford, unwisely\r\nprevents the cultivation of provisions of the first necessity in\r\nsufficient quantity for the subsistence of the population. The flour\r\nof mandioca is generally scarce and dear, arising in part from the\r\nlands in the vicinity of the sea (which alone are fertile) having been\r\ngiven in such liberal portions; so that at the present day they are\r\nunder the dominion of so few persons that it is calculated that for\r\nevery two hundred families there are only eight or ten proprietors,\r\nor _senhores d’engenho_, and who generally permit their tenants\r\nonly to plant the cane. The _jangada_, a peculiar tree, and one\r\nof the most useful in the province, has a trunk commonly straight and\r\nscarcely ever attaining a thickness that a man cannot encompass with\r\nhis arms: it is extremely porous and light. The trunks attached, as\r\nalready described, constitute the only small craft of the country;\r\nfishermen proceed with them to sea out of sight of land, and travellers\r\ntransport themselves, with their moveables, from one port to another.\r\nIt is necessary to drag them on the beach at the end of each voyage to\r\ndry, in order that the wood may not decay so quickly. The trees which\r\nproduce the oil of _cupahyba_ are met with in all the woods; also\r\nthose which produce the gum-copal, the drug benzoin, and the sweet gum\r\nstorax. The latter is here called the balsam tree; and the honey which\r\nthe bees make from the sweets of its flower has the smell of cinnamon.\r\nAmongst other exotic trees which have been naturalized the precious\r\n_sandal_ tree, it is affirmed, would prosper here almost as well\r\nas in the island of Timor, and would save to the state many arrobas of\r\ngold annually expended in bringing it from India.\r\n\r\nThe people of the certam catch large quantities of turtle and ring\r\ndoves with the _manicoba-brava_, an infusion of which is put into\r\nvessels half buried in the sand, in those places where some little\r\nwater remains after the streams are dried up, and to which those birds\r\nare attracted for the purpose of drinking. On taking the infusion, if\r\nthey do not immediately vomit, they cannot again take wing, but quickly\r\nbegin to tremble, and expire in a few moments.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The most considerable are in the western part of the\r\nprovince; but we shall defer speaking of them till we come to finish\r\nthe description of the river St. Francisco, into which they discharge\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe principal ones in the eastern part of the province are the\r\nCapibaribe, the Ipojuca, the Una, the Tracunhaen, or Goyanna, and the\r\nSerenhen.\r\n\r\nThe Capibaribe, or river of the Capibaras,[37] has its origin in the\r\ndistrict of Cayriris Velhos, about fifty leagues distant from the\r\nsea. Its source is brackish; the channel very stony, with many falls,\r\nand navigable only for about eight miles. It is discharged by two\r\nmouths, one within the Recife, and the other near four miles to the\r\nsouth, at the arraial of Affogados, where there is a wooden bridge two\r\nhundred and sixty paces in length. Topacora and Goyta are its principal\r\nconfluents, both of which join it by the right bank, with an interval\r\nof four or five miles. The latter runs from a lake, denominated Lagoa\r\nGrande.\r\n\r\nThe Ipojuca rises in the Cayriris Velhos, near the Capibaribe, and\r\nruns through countries appropriated to the culture of cotton and\r\nsugar, which productions have been extremely advantageous to the\r\nagriculturist. It disembogues between Cape St. Augustine and the island\r\nof St. Aleixo, forming a port for the small vessels by which it is\r\nfrequented.\r\n\r\nThe Serenhen, which is considerable and advantageous to the cultivator,\r\nempties itself almost in front of the isle of St. Aleixo. One of its\r\nlargest confluents is the Ceribo, which meets it on the left bank, not\r\nfar from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Una comes from the district of Garanhuns, with a course of nearly\r\nforty leagues, and in the vicinity of the ocean receives on the right\r\nthe Jacuipe, which is inferior, and runs into the sea through large\r\nwoods. Both serve for the conveyance of timber, that is laden in the\r\nport at its mouth, which is about seven leagues to the south-west of\r\nthe island of St. Aleixo.\r\n\r\nThe Goyanna, which is handsome and considerable, runs into the sea\r\nnine miles to the north of Itamaraca, between the point of Pedras and\r\nthe Cocoa-Tree Point. It takes this name at the confluence of the\r\nTracunhaen, which has a considerable course, with the Capibari-mirim,\r\nmuch inferior, about three leagues from the sea, to which place smacks\r\nand small craft ascend. The water of the first is only good at the\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nThe other rivers upon the coast are the Cururippe, which discharges\r\nitself twenty-eight miles north-east of the St. Francisco; the St.\r\nMiguel, twenty-five miles further; the Alagoas, so called from being\r\nthe mouth of two large lakes; the St. Antonio Mirim; the St. Antonio\r\nGrande; the Cammaragibe; the Manguape; the Rio Grande; the Formozo;\r\nthe Maracahippe, which runs into the sea between the Serenhen and the\r\nIpojuca; the Jaboatao, which receives near the coast the Parapamba by\r\nthe right bank, their common mouth being designated Barra da Jangada,\r\nand is two leagues to the north of Cape St. Augustine; the Iguarassu,\r\nwhich discharges itself with considerable width five or six leagues\r\nnorth of Olinda, and is formed by several small rivers, that unite\r\nabout seven miles from the ocean. All these rivers admit of the\r\nentrance of boats and small vessels. The Moxoto, after a considerable\r\ncourse, empties itself eight miles above the fall of Paulo Alfonso. It\r\nis only a current during the rainy season. The delicate _mandin_\r\nfish, which proceed up whilst it is full, as soon as the river ceases\r\nto run, and the water begins to grow warm in the wells, pines away,\r\nand soon dies. The Pajehu is only a current whilst the thunder showers\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nPROMONTORIES.--Cape St. Augustine, the only one upon the\r\ncoast, is the most famous in the new world, and the most eastern land\r\nof South America, in the latitude 8° 20’. Here is a religious hospicio\r\nof slippered Carmelites, dedicated to Our Lady of Nazareth, which many\r\ncaptains formerly honoured with a salute on passing. It has two forts,\r\neach of which defends a small port, where vessels of an inferior class\r\ncan come to anchor.\r\n\r\nISLANDS.--Itamaraca, for a considerable time called Cosmos,\r\nis three leagues long from north to south, and one in the widest part;\r\nit is mountainous and inhabited. Its principal place is the parish\r\nof Our Lady of Conceiçao, situated on the southern side, about half\r\na league above the mouth of the Iguarassu. This was formerly a town,\r\nthe prerogative of which was transferred to Goyanna, whose senate goes\r\nannually to assist at the festival of its patroness. The mangoes and\r\ngrapes of this island are highly praised. There are also several very\r\nfine salt-pits. The channel which separates it from the continent is\r\nnarrow and deep. At the northern entrance, called Catuama, there is\r\ncommodious anchorage for ships in front of the mouth of the river\r\nMassaranduba.\r\n\r\nThe island of St. Aleixo, which is about four miles in circuit,\r\nwith portions of ground appropriated to the production of various\r\nnecessaries of life, is five leagues to the south-west of Cape St.\r\nAugustine, and a mile distant from the continent.\r\n\r\nPORTS.--No province has so great a number of ports, though\r\nthe generality of them are only capable of receiving smacks and small\r\ncraft. The principal ones are the before-mentioned Catuama; the Recife,\r\nwhich will be described jointly with the town of that name; the\r\nTamandare, which is the best of the whole, in the form of a bay within\r\nthe river so called. It is securely defended by a large fort, and\r\ncapable of receiving a fleet, being four and five fathoms deep at the\r\nentrance, and six within. It lies ten leagues south-west of Cape St.\r\nAugustine.\r\n\r\nJaragua and Pajussara are separated by a point which gives name to the\r\nfirst, where vessels anchor in the summer. The latter one can only be\r\nused in winter. They are two leagues north-east of the river Alagoas,\r\nand in them people disembark to go to the town of this name, because\r\nthe river, which formerly afforded passage for smacks, at present will\r\nnot admit of canoes. It is therefore necessary to go a league by land,\r\nand re-embark on the lake.\r\n\r\nCururippe is a beautiful bay, capable of receiving large ships. It\r\nis sheltered by a reef, which breaks the fury of the sea. It has\r\ntwo entrances, one to the south and the other to the north; but the\r\nanchorage is not generally good. The bay receives the river from which\r\nit derives the name. It is a deep and quiet stream of black water, and\r\nnavigable for canoes some leagues; the least depth is at the mouth. Its\r\nbanks are covered with mangroves, reeds, and divers trees.\r\n\r\nLAKES.--The considerable lakes are the Jiquiba, five leagues\r\nlong and one wide, brackish, containing fish, and is discharged twelve\r\nmiles to the north-east of Cururippe; and the Manguaba, ten leagues\r\nlong and one at the greatest width, is salt, and abounds with fish.\r\nIt is divided by a straight into two portions, one called Lagoa do\r\nNorte, the other Lagoa do Sul, which is the largest. Its channel\r\nof discharge is the before-mentioned river of the Alagoas, about a\r\ncannon-shot across. Various small rivers here empty themselves. Its\r\nbanks are cultivated in parts; in others covered with mangoes. In\r\nits neighbourhood are various sugar works, the produce of which is\r\ntransported, with cotton and other articles, in large canoes, to a\r\nnorthern part of the lake, from whence they are carried in carts for\r\nthe space of three miles to the ports of Jaragua and Pajussara, where\r\nthe smacks are laden with them for the Recife, or Bahia.\r\n\r\nThe following are the towns in the three comarcas into which this\r\nprovince is divided.\r\n\r\n    COMARCAS.     TOWNS.\r\n\r\n                { Ollinda[38]\r\n                { Goyanna\r\n    Ollinda     { Iguarassu\r\n                { Pau d’ Alho\r\n                { Limoeiro.\r\n\r\n\r\n                { Recife\r\n                { Serenhen\r\n    Recife      { St. Antonio\r\n                { St. Antao.\r\n\r\n                { Porto Calvo\r\n                { Alagoas\r\n                { Atalaya\r\n    Alagoas     { Anadia\r\n                { Maceyo\r\n                { Porto de Pedras\r\n                { Poxim\r\n                { Penedo.\r\n\r\nGoyanna, situated in low ground between the rivers Capibari-mirim,\r\nwhich washes it on the north, and Tracunhaen on the south, a little\r\nmore than a league above their confluence, is a large, populous,\r\nand flourishing town, well supplied with meat, fish, and fruits. It\r\nhas a church of Our Lady of Rozario, a hermitage of the same name,\r\nothers of Amparo, Conceiçao, and the Senhor dos Martyrios, a house\r\nof misericordia, a convent of slippered Carmelites, a Magdalen, two\r\nbridges, and a Juiz de Fora; there is a royal professor of Latin. It\r\nhas a fair for cattle on Thursdays. A large quantity of cotton is\r\nexported; the principal productions of the farmers of its extensive\r\ndistrict, where there are above twenty hermitages almost all with\r\nchapels. It is sixty miles north-west of Ollinda, and fifteen from the\r\nsea. In 1810 it had four thousand four hundred inhabitants, including\r\nits district; but the town itself now contains near five thousand.\r\n\r\nSeven miles south of the mouth of the river Goyanna, and near\r\nthe beach, is the parish of St. Lourenço de Tijucopabo, which is\r\naugmenting. Thirty-five miles west of Goyanna is the parish of St.\r\nAntonio de Tracunhaen, near to this river: its inhabitants cultivate\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nIguarassu is considerable, and the most ancient town of the province.\r\nIt is honoured with the title of loyal, and has a church dedicated to\r\nthe companion Saints of Cosme and Damiao, a house of misericordia,\r\na convent of Franciscans, a Magdalen, four hermitages, and is well\r\nsupplied with fish, meat, and fruits. It is five or six leagues north\r\nof Ollinda, and two from the sea, upon the right bank of the river that\r\ngives it the name, and which is formed by the small rivers Ottinga,\r\nPittanga, and Taype, that unite themselves above. There is a bridge\r\nover it, and canoes arrive here with the tide, but smacks remain two\r\nmiles lower down. Sugar and cotton are the articles of exportation.\r\n\r\nTwo leagues north of Iguarassu, on the Goyanna road, is the\r\nconsiderable village of Pasmado, inhabited by whites, in great part\r\nlocksmiths.\r\n\r\nPau d’Alho, situated upon the right bank of the Capibaribe, and\r\nthirty-five miles from the capital, was created a town in 1812, has\r\na church dedicated to the Holy Spirit, a hermitage of Our Lady of\r\nRozario, and a market every eight days.\r\n\r\nLimoeiro, also created a town in 1812, is upon the margin of the\r\nCapibaribe, about thirty miles above Pau d’Alho, and has a church,\r\ndedicated to Our Lady of Expectaçao, and a market every week. Cotton\r\nconstitutes the wealth of its inhabitants. Whilst I remained at\r\nPernambuco, an English gentleman proceeded to this town for the purpose\r\nof establishing a machine for dressing cotton, in which, I understand,\r\nhe has been very successful.\r\n\r\nSerenhen, founded in 1627 with the name of Villa Formoza, situated on\r\nan eminence upon the margin and seven miles above the mouth of the\r\nriver from which it borrows the name, is small, and has a church,\r\ndedicated to Our Lady of Conceiçao, two hermitages, and a convent of\r\nFranciscans. Its environs are remarkable for fertility, abounding with\r\nwater and rich plantations of cane.\r\n\r\nSt. Antonio, so called after the patron of its church, is nine miles\r\nnorth-west of Cape St. Augustin, near the margin of the Parapamba, and\r\nhas two hermitages, one of St. Braz, the other of Our Lady of Rozario.\r\nIt was erected into a town in 1812.\r\n\r\nSt. Antao, situated near the small river Tapacora, and created a town\r\nin 1812, has a church dedicated to the same saint, and two chapels\r\nof Rozario and Livramento, and a market every week. It produces much\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nAmongst other places and considerable parishes in this comarca, is to\r\nbe remarked the Ipojuca, upon the margin of the river from which it\r\nderives its name, two leagues distant from the sea, with a church of\r\nSt. Miguel, and a convent of Franciscans.\r\n\r\nMuribeca, with a church of Nossa Senhora of Rozario, a hermitage of the\r\nsame name, and another of Livramento, is situated between the Recife\r\nand Cape St. Augustin, about three miles from the sea. Sugar is the\r\nproduce of both these places.\r\n\r\nPorto Calvo, a middling town with some commerce, and a church of Our\r\nLady of Aprezentaçao, is situated upon the margin of the river, from\r\nwhich it takes the name, and twenty miles from the sea. Bom Successo\r\nwas its first name; to its haven formerly smacks arrived with the tide.\r\nIt is the native place of the mulatto Calabar, who, passing over to the\r\nDutch in 1632, was to them a great acquisition, and to the Pernambucans\r\na great injury; until he was delivered to the latter, as a reward for\r\ntheir services, in order that he might receive the chastisement due to\r\nhis perfidy. At the taking of this town, a nephew of the Dutch general,\r\nCount Nassau lost his life, and the celebrated Preto Henrique Dias part\r\nof an arm. The latter afterwards distinguished himself in the battle of\r\nthe mountains of Gararappes.\r\n\r\nAlagoas, so called from having its site upon a southern portion of the\r\nlake Manguaba, created with the name of Magdalen, is considerable,\r\nhead of the comarca of its name, and the ordinary residence of the\r\nouvidor, who is also inspector of the woods of the royal marine. It\r\nhas a church of Nossa Senhora of Conceiçao, a convent of Franciscans,\r\nanother of slippered Carmelites, two orders of devout women, three\r\nchapels, with the titles of Amparo, Rozario, and Bom Fim, and a royal\r\nprofessorship of Latin. At all times it is well supplied with fish; and\r\nabounds in the jaca and orange tree. In the beginning of last century\r\nwas exported from the district of this town, two thousand five hundred\r\nrolls of tobacco, of eight arrobas each, and of such good quality,\r\nthat it was bought at fifty per cent. dearer than the same article\r\nfrom Bahia. Sugar is at the present day the riches of its inhabitants.\r\nA custom-house has been recently established within its jurisdiction,\r\nin consequence of the considerable increase in the commerce of this\r\ncomarca.\r\n\r\nAtalaya, six leagues distant from the preceding place, three by water,\r\nand the rest by land, is in a fertile and wholesome country, possessing\r\nexcellent water, and having a church of Nossa Senhora das Brotas. Its\r\nneighbourhood abounds with ipecacuanha, and cotton is cultivated with\r\nthe common provisions of the country. The number of its inhabitants,\r\nincluding those of its district, amount to nearly two thousand; part\r\nof them are _Caboclos_,[39] white, and with more regular features\r\nthan any other known tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nAnadia, a middling sized town, with a church of the Lady of Piety, is\r\nfourteen leagues from Alagoas. Its inhabitants are Indians, Europeans,\r\nwhites of the country, and Mestiços, in number about ten thousand,\r\nincluding those of the district; almost all are cultivators or\r\npurchasers of cotton, its principal produce. By the same law, of 15th\r\nDecember, 1815, which gave to the town of Penedo a Juiz de Fora, were\r\ncreated the towns of Maceyo and Porto de Pedras.\r\n\r\nMaceyo is a dismemberment of the Alagoas, having a district of more\r\nthan seven leagues of coast, computing from the river Alagoas to the\r\nSt. Antonio Grande. In this interval the following rivers run into\r\nthe sea:--The Doce, which is short, and comes from a small lake; the\r\nParatiji, the St. Antonio Mirim, and the Paripueira, which receives\r\nthe Cabuçu on the right, near its mouth. Maceyo is becoming a place of\r\nsome commerce, and will be the emporium of the trade of the comarca of\r\nAlagoas. One English establishment already exists here, and shipments\r\nare made direct from hence to Great Britain. An European first settling\r\nin any of the towns of Brazil, and particularly in places of this\r\nclass, makes a sacrifice of all the comforts common to well regulated\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nPorto de Pedras is a dismemberment of Porto Calvo; its district\r\nembraces nearly nine leagues of coast, occupying the interval from the\r\naforesaid river St. Antonio Grande to the Manguape. The Cumuriji and\r\nthe Tatuamuhy are the principal rivers that empty themselves upon its\r\nshores. The two last towns have each two ordinary judges, and one of\r\norphans; three _veradores_, or species of aldermen, a procurador\r\nof the council, a treasurer, two clerks of the market, an alcaide,\r\nwith a scrivener of his office, two public scriveners, judicial and\r\nnotarial, the first of which holds that office in the council, also in\r\nthe customs, and is market clerk; the second also belongs to the office\r\nof scrivener of the orphans.\r\n\r\nPoxim, a small town upon the margin of the river of the same name,\r\nwhich enters the sea three leagues to the north-east of Cururippe, has\r\na large bridge, and a church dedicated to Our Lady of Madre de Deos.\r\nIt is two miles from the ocean, is well supplied with fish, and has in\r\nits district the new and yet small aldeia of Our Lady of Conceiçao, so\r\ncalled after the patroness of the chapel which ornaments it; and where\r\nupon festival days are assembled six hundred families, dispersed around\r\nits neighbourhood. It is situated near the river Cururippe, four miles\r\nfrom the sea; and its good port, where at present is only laden some\r\ntimber and oil of the _mamona_, with the fertility of the interior\r\nterritory, will contribute to render this a considerable place at some\r\nfuture day. The land in the proximity of the shore is sandy, and well\r\nadapted to the cajue-nut tree, which, in a short time grows to a large\r\nsize, and its fruit would furnish a branch of commerce.\r\n\r\nPenedo, a considerable, populous, and commercial town, is situated\r\npartly in a plain along the bank of the river St. Francisco, and\r\noccasionally suffering by its inundations, and partly upon a height\r\nat the extremity of a range, which is the first elevated land met\r\nwith on the northern margin, on ascending this river. Besides the\r\nchurch dedicated to Nossa Senhora of Rozario, there is a hermitage\r\nwith the same title; another of the Lady of Corrente; others of St.\r\nGonçalo d’Amarante, St. Gonçalo Garcia, and a convent of Franciscans,\r\nwhose ill appropriated grounds occupy a situation the best suited for\r\nthe improvement of the povoaçao. It has a royal Latin master, and a\r\ngood house for the ouvidor. The houses were, till lately, miserable\r\nbuildings of wood; there are now many of stone, with two or three\r\nstories, having portals of a species of grindstone. The river is here\r\nnear a mile in width, and the highest tide is three feet. The greatest\r\nheight of the river, that can be remembered, reached twenty feet. It\r\nis about twenty-five miles from hence to the mouth of the river. The\r\nconfessional roll, which is a tolerably correct one, estimates the\r\npopulation at eleven thousand five hundred and four, including that of\r\nthe district. By a law of the 15th of December, 1805, a Juiz de Fora\r\nwas granted to this town.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-five miles higher up, on the margin of the St. Francisco,\r\nin a delightful situation, is the parish of Collegio, whose dwellers\r\nonly amount to ninety families, and are mostly Indians, of three\r\ndifferent nations. The Acconans who lived in the district of Logoa\r\nComprida, a few miles higher up the river: the Carapotos, who inhabited\r\nthe serra of Cuminaty: and the Cayriris, who dwelt in the vicinity of\r\nthe serra which takes from them its name. The main part of this colony\r\nwander about when not occupied in fishing, according to the custom\r\nof their ancestors, through a country six miles along the river, and\r\nthree broad, which was given to them for the purposes of agriculture.\r\nThe wives of these lazy poltroons work daily in making earthenware,\r\nseated on the ground. They begin to make an earthen vessel by working\r\nthe clay on a banana leaf, placed upon their knees; afterwards it is\r\nput upon a large dish, with pulverized ashes, when it receives the form\r\nand last finish. Without any assistance from the men, they procure and\r\nwork up the clay, proceed to fetch the wood in order to set up large\r\nfires every Saturday night for hardening the vessels made during the\r\nweek. The church was a Jesuitical chapel, which the district already\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nIn this comarca is the considerable arraial of St. Miguel, upon the\r\nmargin and seven leagues above the mouth of the river of the same name.\r\nIt has a church of Nossa Senhora of O, whose parishioners amount to\r\nfifteen hundred, the main part dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe western portion of the province is much more extensive than the\r\npreceding, but is very thinly inhabited, being a sterile and parched up\r\ncountry, without other rains than those afforded by thunder showers.\r\nIn all parts, however, are met with portions of ground more or less\r\nfertile, which would produce mandioca, Indian corn, feijao, hortulans,\r\ncottons, fruits, and the sugar cane. Cattle are generally bred in this\r\nvast district, and game abounds in great variety. It was included\r\nin the jurisdiction of the ouvidor of Jacobina until 1810, when it\r\nbecame a comarca, receiving the interior portion of that of Recife.\r\nIt is at present called the ouvidorship of the certam of Pernambuco,\r\nthe magistrate not having chosen the town for its head, by which it\r\nought to be designated. Cattle, hides, cotton, salt, and gold, are the\r\narticles of its exportation.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The Rio Grande and the Correntes are the only considerable\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nThe river St. Francisco, whose description we left off at the\r\nconfluence of the Carinhenha, only receives from thence to its entrance\r\ninto the ocean, five streams of any importance, namely, the Rans, the\r\nParimirim, the Verde, on the right, the Correntes, one hundred miles\r\nbelow the first, and the Rio Grande, one hundred and forty lower on the\r\nleft, continuing from thence northward, with many small windings, being\r\nof considerable width, and having many islands and some currents which\r\ndo not impede navigation. Its margins are flat, and in some parts so\r\nlow, that at the inundations, they are submerged for more than seven\r\nmiles. Below the confluence of Rio Grande, its course bends towards\r\nthe east, and then to the east-south-east, preserving the same width\r\nfor a long way, to the aldeia of Vargem Redonda, where the navigation\r\nterminates from above, and the lateral lands begin to rise. Its channel\r\ngradually becomes narrower, and the current is rapidly impelled between\r\nblue and black rocks, to the small aldeia of Caninde, (the boundary\r\nof the navigation from the ocean,) which is seventy miles below the\r\nother. In this interval there are various large falls, of which the\r\nmost interesting and famous is that of Paulo Affonso. Between these\r\nfalls canoes navigate during the summer season. Through Caninde it\r\ncontinues to run between stony banks, thinly covered with soil and\r\nan impoverished vegetation, being one hundred fathoms in height, the\r\nwidth of the river not exceeding a sling’s throw for the distance of\r\nten miles, to the mouth of the Jacare, where its elevated and rugged\r\nbanks terminate. Its bed in this part is overspread with cleft reefs,\r\nappearing like the relics of a majestic sluice or dock.\r\n\r\nThree leagues below is the small island of Ferro, where the margins\r\nbegin to diminish in elevation, and the river to augment in width,\r\nexhibiting crowns of white sand, the resort of the ash-coloured and\r\nwhite heron, and where myriads of black diving birds assemble; forming\r\nthemselves like a net, they encircle the fish in shoal places, not\r\ninfested by the dreaded _piranha_ fish. Here the sea-mew, and\r\nother aquatic birds, make their nests in small holes, their young being\r\nhatched by the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nSix leagues below the island of Ferro, is that of Oiro, also small,\r\nhigh, and rocky, crowned with a hermitage of Nossa Senhora of Prazeres.\r\nThese are the only islands met with in the space of one hundred miles\r\nfrom Caninde to the town of Penedo, where the small range of hills\r\nthat borders the left bank of the river terminates. Two miles below\r\nVilla Nova, the elevation of the right margin also has its bounds,\r\nand the river begins to divide its course, forming a great number\r\nof islands, generally low, and abounding with woods, giving them an\r\nagreeable aspect. They possess portions of fertile soil, where some\r\nrice, maize, mandioca, sugar, and hortulans, are cultivated. Some are\r\nsandy, others are composed of grey clay, with a bed of black above,\r\nabout a foot in depth and above this another, of yellow earth, from\r\nthree to four spans in thickness. The whole are submerged at the\r\nperiod of the overflowings of this great river. The cassia tree is\r\nhere numerous, and extremely beautiful while blooming with its rosy\r\nflowers. It affords a sort of husky fruit, two spans in length, and of\r\nproportionable thickness, and abounds on both margins of the river for\r\nabout thirty-five miles above the town of Penedo. This river, so deep\r\nin the interior of the continent, disembogues by two mouths of very\r\nunequal size; the principal one is on the north, being near two miles\r\nwide, with so little depth that the smacks can enter it only at high\r\nwater, and there wait for the full tides to get out. The navigation\r\nfrom the falls, upwards, is performed in barks and _ajojos_, which\r\nare two or more canoes moored together with cross pieces of timber\r\nabove. All produce descending the river below the falls is disembarked\r\nat Vargem Redonda, a district of the parish and julgado of Tacaratu,\r\nand transmitted on oxen to the port of Caninde, or Piranhas, which is\r\ntwo miles lower down. The navigation from hence to Penedo, is solely\r\nby the ajojos, and upwards always with a sail. The wind is favourable\r\nfrom eight o’clock of the day to the following morning’s dawn, but\r\nnot without variation according to the age of the moon and the state\r\nof the weather; always increasing at evening, and frequently becoming\r\nquite calm before midnight. These craft descend always with a strong\r\ncurrent, whilst there is no wind to produce an agitation of the water.\r\nWhen the breeze is high the current diminishes, and the river rises\r\nabove a span. Fish is more abundant above the falls, which difference,\r\nthe oldest men say originated in the extirpating system of fishing with\r\nwhat are called _tapagens_, a mode of enclosing them, and which\r\nwas unjustly countenanced by the chief magistrates, who drew from this\r\nabuse considerable revenues, which disappeared without leaving to the\r\npublic one signal of its expenditure. The most valuable fish of this\r\nriver are the _sorubin_, which grows to the size of a man; the\r\n_mandin_, four feet in length, and proportionably thick, with\r\nlarge beards; the _pira_, two feet long; and the _piranha_,\r\nwhich is short and thick, with very sharp teeth, and fatal to all\r\nliving creatures that come within its reach. None of these fish have\r\nscales. The _camurin_, with a white stripe on both sides; and the\r\n_camurupin_, are both thick and scaly.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, as if by a natural instinct, do not approach the waters that\r\nare muddy, but drink only at those parts where there is a current,\r\nfrom an innate dread of the _piranhas_, which lurk about with\r\ndestructive intent in the dead waters.\r\n\r\nThe Correntes, which has a course of about one hundred and forty\r\nmiles, issues from a lake, and runs first under the name of Formozo,\r\nreceiving another river of the same name, and afterwards the Eguas,\r\nGuara, and Arrojado. It affords navigation for a considerable space,\r\nand disembogues into the St. Francisco ten miles below the chapel of\r\nBom Jesus da Lappa. All the branches mentioned issue from the skirts\r\nor proximity of the serra of Paranan. Some run through auriferous\r\ncountries, where mining has originated only a few years, and which\r\nhas been the occasion of founding in the vicinity of the river Eguas\r\na chapel of Our Lady of Glory, whose parish contained six hundred and\r\neighty-four families, with one thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight\r\nadults, in the year 1809; many being breeders of cattle, others\r\nagriculturists.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande, whose original name is not known, and for which the\r\npresent one was substituted, in consequence of the ridiculous and\r\nprevailing custom in the Brazil of designating many large rivers, of\r\nvarious districts, by the term of Rio Grande, (Large River,) thereby\r\ncreating a confusion of names, has fifty leagues of course, and\r\noriginates in the serra of Paranan, near the register of St. Domingos,\r\nabout five leagues from the source of the Guara, a branch of the\r\nCorrentes. After flowing a considerable way, the Mosquito joins it, and\r\nfive leagues lower the Femeas, which rises fifteen miles from Serra\r\nTabatinga; twelve miles further it is entered by the Ondas, which\r\noriginates eight miles from the preceding, and nearer the Sobrado, an\r\narm of the Tucantines, and runs rapidly through a gold and diamond\r\ncountry. Fifteen miles below, it receives the Branco, navigable to the\r\nsituation of Tres Barras, so called in consequence of the union with\r\nit of the Riachao and the Janeiro, which enter in front of each other;\r\nseventy miles lower also on the left, the Preto joins, which is one of\r\nits largest tributaries, and rises in the skirts of the Serra Figuras,\r\nwhich is a continuation of that of Mangabeiro, from whence issue the\r\nother branches mentioned, excepting the Riachao. Its first name is the\r\nriver of Doirados, and its current of clear water is rapidly impelled\r\nthrough a winding bed, edged with steep margins. It passes near the\r\nvillage of Formoza, which has a hermitage of Senhor do Bom Fim, and\r\nby the parish of St. Ritta, which is forty miles below the other,\r\nand the same distance above the mouth of the river. The Rio Grande,\r\nwhich enters the St. Francisco fifty miles below the confluence of\r\nthe Preto, is navigable to the mouth of the Ondas, and without falls\r\nto the Branco, passes the parish of St. Anna de Campo Largo, which\r\nis thirty-five miles above the embouchure of the Preto; it is well\r\nstored with the _sorubin_, _crumatan_, large _doirados_, the _piranha_,\r\n_piau_, _martrinchan_, and other sorts of fish. Its water has a\r\nvery different colour from the river which receives it, and remains\r\nunchanged for a considerable distance after entering the St. Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this ouvidoria are,\r\n\r\n    Barra do Rio Grande\r\n    Santa Maria\r\n    Flores\r\n    Pilao Arcado\r\n    Assumpçao\r\n    Symbres.\r\n\r\nThe town of Barra do Rio Grande is at the northern angle of the\r\nconfluent which affords it the name, is in a state of mediocrity,\r\nwell supplied with meat and fish, and has some commerce. The church\r\nis dedicated to St. Francisco das Chagas; and the number of its\r\ninhabitants is included in one thousand and thirty-six families. The\r\npassage of the St. Francisco, here a mile wide, is much frequented.\r\n\r\nPilao Arcado, created a town in 1810, is one hundred miles below the\r\npreceding, and is well situated near a small hill upon the margin of\r\nthe St. Francisco, its only resource for water, and whose greatest\r\ninundations always visit it with some injury. The church, dedicated to\r\nSt. Antonio, is new, and solidly built with bricks and lime. The houses\r\nare generally earth and wood, and many of them covered with straw. It\r\nhas three hundred families, which are increasing, and, with those of\r\nits vast district, comprise five thousand inhabitants, who cultivate\r\nmandioca, maize, vegetables, good melons, and water-melons, upon the\r\nmargins of the river. The land around it is generally wild and sterile,\r\nand alone appropriated to the breeding of cattle, which are subject\r\nto the horrible mortality, produced by frequent droughts. There are\r\na great many small lakes, at various distances from the river, all\r\nmore or less brackish, and upon whose margins the salt, formed by the\r\nardent heat of the sun, appears like hoarfrost. The water of these\r\nlakes (and even soft water) filtered through a contiguous earth in\r\nwooden vessels, or leather finely perforated, and exposed on boards to\r\nthe weather, in eight days of heat crystallizes, becoming salt as white\r\nas marine salt. Although in lands which have proprietors, they are,\r\nlike auriferous soils, reputed common to all those who wish to benefit\r\nby them, and are a great resource for the poor, almost all the salt\r\nhere produced is transmitted to the centre of Minas Geraes.\r\n\r\nVilla Real de Santa Maria, situated upon an island three miles long,\r\nand a great distance below the preceding, has the aspect of an aldeia,\r\nwith one hundred and sixty families, chiefly Indians, who are hunters,\r\nfishermen, and agriculturists, and are exempt from tribute. Their wives\r\nspin and weave cotton, and work in the manufactory of earthenware, of\r\nwhich a considerable portion is exported.\r\n\r\nThe town of N. Senhora d’Assumpçao takes the name from the patroness\r\nof its church. The inhabitants, comprising one hundred and fifty-four\r\nfamilies, are all Indians; they fish, hunt, and cultivate mandioca,\r\nmaize, water-melons, hortulans, and cotton. It is at the western\r\nextremity of an island eighteen miles long, and the same distance below\r\nthe preceding town. In front of this island is the middling arraial and\r\njulgado of Quebrobo, with a church of Conceiçao, whose parishioners,\r\nabout eighteen hundred and twenty-seven families of all complexions,\r\nare mostly dispersed over its vast district. Cotton and cattle are\r\ntheir productions.\r\n\r\nFlores, erected into a town in the year 1810, is yet small and in the\r\nvicinity of the river Pajehu. A filial chapel of the parish of Quebrobo\r\nserves it for a church. The inhabitants draw their subsistence from the\r\nbreeding of cattle, and the culture of cotton.\r\n\r\nSymbres, formerly Ororoba, is a small town of Chucuru Indians, with\r\nsome whites and mesticos, cultivators of cotton and the provisions of\r\nthe country. The wives of the first make earthenware with considerable\r\nart, and spin and weave cotton. They utter great lamentations when\r\ntheir husbands do not bring home game from the woods. The church is\r\ndedicated to the Lady of the Mountain; and its population consists of\r\nfour hundred and eighty families.\r\n\r\nThe considerable arraial, julgado, and parish of St. Antonio, in\r\nthe district of Garanhuns, bordering upon the preceding, is of this\r\ncomarca, having been, with the latter one, dismembered from that of the\r\nRecife. Its people grow cotton.\r\n\r\nIn this ouvidorship is also the parish of St. Anna do Sacramento do\r\nAngical, dismembered from that of Campo Largo, from which it is distant\r\nthirty miles, and ten from the margin of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded the description of the province, we will now proceed\r\nto a consideration of its capital, commonly called Pernambuco, (which\r\nname is a corruption of Paranabuco, by which the Cahetes designated the\r\nport, where at the present day the smallest class of vessels anchor,)\r\nand is understood to comprehend two distinct places, the city of\r\nOllinda and the town of Recife, (so called from the reef in front of\r\nit,) with an interval of a league, communicating by a narrow sand-bank\r\nfrom north to south, also by an arm of the sea that enters the small\r\nriver Biberibe, which runs along the said sand-bank from one place\r\nto the other, and likewise by a road on the main land, at no great\r\ndistance from the western margin of the same river.\r\n\r\nRECIFE, which is the official designation of the capital,\r\nthe government documents being so signed, is large, populous, and\r\ncommercial, with tolerable houses, handsome churches, a convent of\r\npriests of the congregation of Oratorio, another of Franciscans, a\r\nthird of slippered Carmelites, an alms and entertaining house of\r\nTerra Santa, another of Italian Barbonios, a recolhimento of women,\r\nan episcopal palace, and an hospital of Lazarettos. The Jesuits had\r\na college here, which now constitutes the palace of the governors.\r\nThis town is divided into three portions, or districts, by the river\r\nCapibaribe, namely, Recife, St. Antonio, and Boavista. Each of these\r\nforms a separate parish, and they communicate by two bridges; that of\r\nBoavista, which is chiefly of wood, and paved, is three hundred and\r\ntwenty paces long; that of St. Antonio, two hundred and ninety paces\r\nacross, was in great part of stone, but having given way, the remainder\r\nis imperfectly supplied with wood, not admitting of the passage of a\r\ncarriage, and has been allowed to remain for a considerable time in\r\nthis condition, so disreputable to the town. At each end it has a stone\r\narch of rather an elegant construction, above which there are small\r\nchapels, niches, and saints, where mass is celebrated. In the street,\r\nfronting the niches with saints, many of the inhabitants prostrate\r\nthemselves, at dusk, for some time in a posture of devotion. The\r\nbridges are flat and not many feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe first part, or the Recife, occupies a peninsula, and is the\r\nemporium of the town’s commerce, the stores of the merchants being\r\nsituated in it. The tongue of land, or sand-bank before mentioned,\r\nwhich extends itself from Ollinda to the south between the sea and the\r\nriver Biberibe, terminates here. It is the site of the custom-house,\r\nwhich of itself is an indifferent edifice. The Rua das Cruzes is the\r\nbest street, and although short is wide and neat; the others are mostly\r\npaved, but are narrow and inelegant. Its church, which is handsome, and\r\ncommonly designated Corpo Santo, has for its nominal patron St. Pedro\r\nGonsalvez.\r\n\r\nThe second portion of the town, called St. Antonio, occupies another\r\npeninsula, which is the northern extremity of the island, formed by two\r\narms of the Capibaribe. It was first planted with cocoa-nut trees by\r\nPrince Nassau, the Dutch governor, who erected Fribourg House for his\r\nown residence, and founded the town of Mauritius upon it. It has better\r\nstreets than the Recife, although generally sandy, and not paved, with\r\nhigh footways laid with bricks. Here is a small square, surrounded with\r\nneat houses, having only a ground floor, with a piazza to the interior\r\nfront, and may be denominated a species of bazar, consisting solely\r\nof shops, where a variety of articles are sold. The mother church is\r\ndedicated to SS. Sacramento. The treasury and the governor’s palace are\r\nsituated here. The latter is not the residence of the governor, but\r\ncontains various public offices, and is used for a sort of levee, held\r\nupon occasions of the birthday of any of the royal family.\r\n\r\nThe third part of the town, called Boavista, is the only portion\r\nsusceptible of any considerable increase, being situated on the\r\ncontinent. It has advanced in magnitude with the others, but is\r\ndestitute of regularity, which may be attributed to the negligence of\r\nthe senate in not having marked out the streets in right lines at its\r\ncommencement. Its church is also dedicated to SS. Sacramento. Here also\r\nthe Dutch governor built the first house, which he called Boavista,\r\nand, being a Portuguese name, the place has retained it. These three\r\nportions, running in a line from east to west, form this large and\r\nflourishing town, which, besides the governor, has an ouvidor, a port\r\nadmiral, a Juiz de Fora, each of them having various inspections, and\r\nthree royal professors of Latin, one of philosophy, and another of\r\neloquence and poetry. The usual junta, or council da fazenda real, to\r\ndecide upon all matters relative to the province, is composed of the\r\ngovernor, the ouvidor, the Juiz de Fora, the attorney-general, the port\r\nadmiral, the chief of the treasury, and the judge or comptroller of the\r\ncustom-house, who hold their sittings at the treasury. The suburbs are\r\nan extensive plain, with handsome cocoa-nut tree groves, interspersed\r\nwith _sitios_, or country-houses. The inhabitants drink the water\r\nprincipally of the Biberibe, collected into a reservoir at Ollinda,\r\nformed by a sort of barrier, denominated a _varadoiro_, which\r\nimpedes the further advance of the tide, and accumulates the fresh\r\nwater above. This bulwark, which also serves as a bridge or passage\r\nover the river to Ollinda, is in part covered by a handsome archway,\r\nbelow which the water passes through circular spouts, and at the other\r\nparts by larger and square channels; presenting altogether twenty-four\r\nmouths, from whence the water issues in spray, forming many pleasing\r\ncascades. From hence it is conveyed in covered canoes for the supply of\r\nthe Recife. The water of the Capibaribe is also brought in canoes from\r\nMonteiro.\r\n\r\nThe port of Recife, which is not deep enough for vessels of a large\r\nclass, is amongst the most wonderful works of nature. A recife, or\r\nchain of reef, which extends itself from the entrance of Bahia to Cape\r\nSt. Roque, parallel with and at no great distance from the shore, in\r\nno part appears so much like an operation of human art as here. It is\r\nprolonged for the space of a league in a direct line with and about two\r\nhundred yards from the beach, having the aspect of a large flat wall,\r\nbeing always above the level of the sea, and at low water six feet is\r\ndiscovered. This reef, which is perpendicular on the land side, and\r\ngradually declining on the other, here suddenly disappears opposite\r\nthe most northern part of the Recife, having on its extremity the fort\r\nof Picao, and forming a fine harbour, which must have been the sole\r\ninducement for the foundation of the capital in this situation. Vessels\r\nentering the port navigate as near as possible to the internal side of\r\nthe reef, where they require much depth till they arrive at the most\r\ncommodious place of anchorage. The occasionally agitated ocean here\r\nfinds its bounds, and dashes in tumultuous and angry waves against the\r\nreef, the foaming spray not disturbing the smooth water within, but\r\naffording a delightfully cooling freshness, as well as an interesting\r\nspectacle, to the houses situated upon the beach, and principally\r\noccupied in stores by the merchants. Large ships anchor to the north of\r\nthe fort of Picao, in a bay without shelter, fronting the forts of Brun\r\nand Buraco, situated upon the before-mentioned sand-bank. The fort of\r\nBrun, which the Dutch commenced on the 25th of June, 1631, and gave it\r\nthe name of a maternal relative of their General Theodore, had for some\r\ntime among the Pernambucanans the appellation of Perreril.\r\n\r\nThis place, while yet of little consequence, was taken by the Dutch\r\nin 1630, who retained it for twenty-four years, and did more for it\r\nin public works during that time, as was candidly admitted to me by\r\na Portuguese gentleman holding a public situation here, than has\r\never been done since. Among the monuments which attest the spirit of\r\nimprovement that marked the Dutch possession of this part of the\r\nBrazil, there is (or was a few years ago) a stone of European marble\r\nbearing the following inscription:\r\n\r\n                              Op Gebouwt\r\n                                 onder\r\n                           D’Hooge Regeringe\r\n                                  van\r\n                          Præsid^t en Raden,\r\n                           Anno MDCLII.[40]\r\n\r\nThis stone was seen by several of the English merchants within the last\r\nthree years at the door of the church of Corpo Santo, among the masonry\r\nwork destined for the completion of this fine edifice; but it certainly\r\nis not introduced into the walls of the building, nor could I discover\r\nany trace of it.\r\n\r\nThe before-mentioned forts, and that of Cinco Pontas, at the southern\r\nextremity of St. Antonio, are the principal ones that defend the place;\r\nthe two first are in good order.\r\n\r\nA league to the south of Recife, near the southern arm of the\r\nCapibaribe, is the arraial of Affogadas, which is increasing, and is\r\nornamented with three hermitages, of Nossa Senhora of Paz, of Rozario,\r\nand of St. Miguel. There is here a wooden bridge communicating with St.\r\nAntonio.\r\n\r\nThe city of Ollinda, which, as has been observed, constitutes a part\r\nof Pernambuco, was burnt by the Dutch in 1631, and is beautifully\r\nsituated upon a cluster of eminences, which are the commencement of\r\na small cordillera, that extends itself towards the interior of the\r\ncontinent. It was in former times rich, flourishing, and powerful, and\r\nwas erected into an episcopal city in the year 1676, but continued\r\nto fall into decay, and is at present poor and thinly inhabited,\r\nowing to the vicinity of the town of Recife, which has deprived it of\r\nall its commerce. It is, however, a fine retreat for the studious,\r\nconvalescent, or misanthropical, who seek retirement from the tumult\r\nand bustle of the world. It has a house of misericordia, with its\r\nhospital, a recolhimento, or Magdalen house, a convent of Franciscans,\r\none of unslippered Carmelites, another of slippered Carmelites, and a\r\nfourth of Benedictines; a palace in which the governors in former times\r\nwere obliged to reside six months in the year; an episcopal palace,\r\nfinely situated, but much deteriorated, being unoccupied in consequence\r\nof the death of the bishop; a seminary in the ex-Jesuitical college,\r\nwith schools, and professors of Greek, Latin, French, geography,\r\nrhetoric, universal history, philosophy, drawing, ecclesiastical\r\nhistory, dogmatical and moral theology, a great number of hermitages,\r\nand a garden of trees and exotic plants, chiefly Asiatic, from whence\r\nthe farmers can transplant them into their own grounds. It has also\r\nthe bread-fruit tree and Otaheitan cane, and occupies an advantageous\r\nsituation, but is not kept in good order. This city is divided into two\r\nparishes, one of them being of the cathedral, which is a magnificent\r\nedifice, with three naves, dedicated to St. Salvador, and contains\r\neight hundred and eighty houses; the other has for parochial the church\r\nof St. Pedro Martin, and comprises three hundred and fifteen houses.\r\n\r\nThe senate is rich; almost all the houses pay to it a _testoon_\r\n(three hundred reas) of tax for each span of front. Almost all have\r\nlarge gardens, but generally of little or no utility. The ground is\r\nappropriated to the cultivation of fruitful trees, of which mangoes are\r\nthe principal.\r\n\r\nThe last donatory of this province affirmed that Ollinda, when it was\r\nburned, had two thousand five hundred houses, which were estimated to\r\ncontain twenty-five thousand inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe decay of Ollinda was considered by many of its inhabitants as\r\na punishment for the pride of its rich and leading persons, whose\r\nlibertinism had arrived at such a pitch, that an orator preaching\r\non a festival day in one of the parish churches, and energetically\r\ndeclaiming against the vices prevailing in the country, some of the\r\nprincipal people commanded him to be silent, and dragged him with\r\nviolence from the pulpit, without the auxiliary priests being able to\r\nprevent the outrage.\r\n\r\nThe convents, which are handsome and well-built, occupy the finest\r\nsituations in Ollinda, generally upon the acclivity or summits of\r\nthe eminences, from whence the views are interesting. Some of these\r\nreligious establishments have now but few friars, and one of them was\r\noccupied by a military detachment. The walls surrounding the grounds of\r\nseveral, I observed, were broken down in many parts, and in a state of\r\ndilapidation; and the enclosures, which would have formed fine pleasure\r\ngrounds, were barren, unplanted, and quite neglected.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MATUTO RETURNING FROM PERNAMBUCO.]\r\n\r\nOn proceeding from hence by the sand-bank to the Recife, I was\r\nsuddenly startled at the appearance of a human skull and bones,\r\nnear a pillar or beacon situated between the two forts. Considerably\r\nimpressed by so unexpected a sight, and moving slowly forward with such\r\nfeelings as it was calculated to excite, not having any other idea but\r\nthat they were the remains of some murdered person, I found myself in\r\nthe midst of human bones, over-spreading the summit of the sand-bank. I\r\nnow began to surmise that it was the cemetery of the blacks, which was\r\nconfirmed on my arrival at the Recife. The dead bodies of the negroes\r\nare wrapped up in a piece of coarse cotton cloth, and being thinly\r\ncovered with sand is the reason of their remains soon becoming thus\r\nindecently exposed. I understand that the white people were at one time\r\nalso interred here. The English have a burying-ground at St. Amaro, not\r\nfar from Boavista.\r\n\r\nThe roads branching off from Pernambuco into the interior are very\r\ngood for a few miles, although sandy, and in some parts deep. They\r\nsoon begin to contract into narrow bridle-ways, and are the tracks\r\nof troops of horses coming from the certams with cotton principally,\r\nand some other produce. The horses here are, from the sandy nature\r\nof the roads, never shod, and those driven from the interior by\r\nthe _mattutos_[41] (inhabitants of the mattos, or woods) are\r\ngenerally very miserable and poor, and seem almost to give way under\r\nthe burden of two bags of cotton, attached one on each side to a rudely\r\nconstructed pack-saddle. Cords are commonly used by these persons\r\nfor stirrups, into which they introduce the great toe. Their dress,\r\nconsisting of a coarse cotton shirt hanging loosely over drawers, or\r\ntrowsers, reaching to the calf of the leg, with a large slouching\r\nstraw or black hat, a gun occasionally borne over one shoulder, and a\r\nsword in a wooden sheath, awkwardly suspended from a leathern belt,\r\ngives them a singular appearance. Some of these groups are rather of\r\na superior order, being dressed in brown leathern overalls, a jacket,\r\nand a low round hat of the same. Parties of men and horses are thus\r\ncontinually arriving at and departing from Pernambuco. The men exhibit\r\na great variety of complexions, and not one is to be seen that can be\r\nsaid to be of pure European descent, all having a mixture of Indian and\r\nAfrican physiognomy. They are generally active and well formed. Few are\r\nIndians, more are mesticos.\r\n\r\nThe cotton planters, as well as proprietors of sugar works, visit\r\nthe emporium of Pernambucan commerce in their gayest vestments, with\r\ntheir horses caparisoned in all the trappings and paraphernalia of\r\nPortuguese saddlery. The Brazilians generally, when they go from\r\nhome, are fond of external show, without regard to much neatness,\r\nand upon those occasions they form a striking contrast to their\r\ngeneral disgusting appearance in their domestic circles. There the\r\nmen are usually seen with a dressing gown, or a shirt worn loosely\r\nover drawers, without stockings, their breasts exposed, and indulging\r\ninert and slovenly propensities. The females, having this example\r\nbefore them, claim some allowance for their loose and slatternly\r\nmode of dressing, when at home, and their worse habit of generally\r\nexpectorating, without regard to person, time, or place. Young females\r\nare entitled to much consideration also, on account of the illiberal\r\nsystem pursued in their education and manner of bringing up. They\r\nare, it may be said, almost excluded from society; and the suspicious\r\ntreatment they experience from their parents must tend to extinguish\r\nevery liberal and moral sentiment; in fact, it cannot be considered\r\nthat those very parents themselves possess much, or they would not\r\nsubject them to an ungracious and scrutinizing watch, by generally\r\nkeeping them shut up, so that they do not enjoy even the necessary\r\nexercise for health, to which their Turkish mode of sitting on the\r\nground or upon mats, is not very congenial. If a family walk out, the\r\ndaughters precede the father and mother, and the negroes, frequently\r\ncomposing the whole household, bring up the rear. Their grand\r\nopportunities for displaying their persons are religious holidays and\r\nfestivals, and the midnight masses at the churches are said to be fully\r\nattended by the females.\r\n\r\nThe lady of General Rego, the governor, who is a very accomplished\r\nwoman, has endeavoured, very amiably but ineffectually, to introduce\r\na social intercourse amongst the families, and particularly the\r\nfemales, of Pernambuco; and although this lady succeeded in making a\r\ncommencement, it was afterwards declined by the families themselves,\r\nfrom the ridiculous excuse that it would become expensive to have new\r\ndresses for every fresh visit. The general also gave a public ball to\r\nthe inhabitants, which was followed by one on the part of the English\r\nmerchants; but it would appear, with the exception of some of the\r\nleading persons, that the inhabitants, from their little intercourse\r\nwith the world, are yet inimical to any refined system of society.\r\n\r\nThe cotton planters, and senhors d’engenho in the interior, are stated\r\nto be liberal and hospitable to strangers; and many of them, who have\r\nbeen recently acquiring considerable property, live in a comparatively\r\ncomfortable style.\r\n\r\nApathy is a strong characteristic in the lower orders of Brazilians.\r\nIn my various excursions near Pernambuco, I have seen men, at all\r\nhours of the day, stretched out upon tables, upon mats, or in redes,\r\n(nets,) slumbering their time away. If this class of people can obtain\r\nsufficient to satisfy the wants of the day, their views extend no\r\nfurther, and industry is no where seen amongst them; besides, the\r\nagricultural arm is paralysed nearly one-third of the year by holidays\r\nand saint days.\r\n\r\nI was very hospitably entertained during a portion of my stay at\r\nPernambuco by John Lempriere, Esq. the British consul, whose sitio\r\nis at the Solidado, a small hamlet, in which is situated a palace,\r\nformerly belonging to the bishop. It is a fine edifice, and built\r\nwith uniformity, but is now rapidly sinking into decay, which\r\nwill not be less accelerated by the use to which it is at present\r\nappropriated--that of a barrack. I brought a letter of introduction\r\nto Mr. Cockshott, when we immediately recognised each other as old\r\nacquaintances, his family and mine having been upon the most intimate\r\nterms of friendship for many years. I experienced great kindness from\r\nhim, as well as many of the English merchants residing here, and spent\r\na portion of my time at his country sitio, pleasantly situated at\r\nPonta de Cho, upon the margin of the Capibaribe, from whence I was\r\naccompanied by Mr. Ray, the American consul, who also has a house here,\r\nto visit many of the neighbouring places, and cannot upon this occasion\r\nrefrain from doing justice to my feelings, in acknowledging his frank\r\nand spontaneous attention and liberality.\r\n\r\nThe rides from Recife to Ponta de Cho, by several roads, are equally\r\ndelightful, being partly bordered with lime hedges, and fences formed\r\nof the cocoa branch, interspersed with verdant foliage, and all the\r\nvariety of fruit trees peculiar to the clime; groups of the high\r\ntowering cocoa-nut tree heighten the beauty of the scenery, every where\r\nrichly wooded.\r\n\r\nThe roads branching from Boavista, and meeting in one, about half-way\r\nto Ponta de Cho, are adorned with some elegant white houses, in a very\r\nexcellent state of exterior repair, the grounds being enclosed by\r\nlofty walls, and many of the front entrances, consisting of a handsome\r\nportico, excelling any thing in this style near Rio de Janeiro. Every\r\nhundred yards, places of this character are met with to Ponta de Cho,\r\nwhere the river opens out and presents a very pleasing scene, the road\r\nrunning for a short distance along its margin, fronted by the residence\r\nof the governor, not very gracefully ornamented with a chapel in the\r\nmiddle of the entrance court. From hence the main road leaves the\r\nriver, and for about two miles presents many neat houses to the Poco de\r\nPanela, some of them being the residences of English merchants.\r\n\r\nIn this interval the village of Casa Forte is passed, celebrated\r\nfor having been one of the scenes of contest between the Dutch and\r\nPortuguese. The village of Poço de Panela is upon the left bank of the\r\nriver, and is enlivened with houses of much more taste and neatness\r\nthan a stranger would expect to see, with the impressions made upon his\r\nmind on landing at Recife.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, that although the environs of Pernambuco have a\r\nfertilized appearance, in consequence of being well wooded, the soil is\r\nin a miserable state of cultivation, and not rendered so productive,\r\nby two-thirds, as it might be, being very generally uncleared of the\r\nbrushwood, and a great portion remaining in its primeval condition.\r\nProceeding from Ponta de Cho, by the Cruz das Almas road, which leads\r\nto Ollinda, a great proportion of the surrounding country is in a wild\r\nstate; here and there are seen small patches of mandioca, groves of\r\ncocoa-nut, and other fruit trees, but the general aspect demonstrates\r\nthe want of industry, for it would be expected that every yard of\r\nground so near to a commercial city, with nearly one hundred vessels\r\nof different classes usually lying in its port, would be in progress\r\nat least of agricultural improvement. It is also remarkable, that\r\nbetween Recife and Ollinda, which latter city was formerly the seat\r\nof government and the centre of commerce, there is not a good road\r\nthe whole way, parts of it for a considerable distance assuming the\r\nappearance of a mere track. The present governor has ordered a road\r\nto be commenced by a nearer route, and in many places the germ of\r\nimprovement in this essential point is observable, new roads being\r\npartly made and staked out. Intelligence and civilization is only\r\ndiffused through a country by facility of communication, and to General\r\nRego, the Pernambucanans are indebted for promoting this blessing;\r\nthe roads in the immediate vicinity of the town have been widened and\r\notherwise improved by his orders; and it is highly to be wished that\r\nsuch a spirit, tending so much to the real benefit of the province, may\r\nbe encouraged. The revolution here, in 1817, is said to have materially\r\nretarded improvement, as that measure was brought about, not from any\r\ngenuine sentiments of liberty, the four or five persons at the head of\r\nit being only desirous of procuring their individual aggrandizement;\r\nand it is said that such jealousy at last existed amongst them, that\r\nthey attended the council secretly armed. They were men of no talent,\r\nand the principal actor, Senhor Martyens, was a decayed Portuguese\r\nmerchant, from London. They, as well as many others, paid the forfeit\r\nof their lives for prematurely attempting a change which they did not\r\nunderstand, but which the lapse of a few years has, happily for the\r\nadvancement of this country, brought about.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: STYLE OF HOUSES AT POCO DE FERNELLA.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGROES IMPELLING A CANOE WITH THE YARA & SCENERY AT\r\n  PONTA DECHO.]\r\n\r\nThe new constitution of Portugal, already adopted at Para and Bahia,\r\nwas spontaneously acceded to by the governor, the different\r\npublic officers, and the people, without any effusion of blood, in\r\nthe month of January, 1821. The imprisonment at Bahia, since 1818, of\r\nsome of the first men of Pernambuco, arrested on suspicion of being\r\nimplicated in the revolution, will now no doubt have its termination.\r\nThat event brought upon Pernambuco a strict military government, and\r\nat the corner of every street after dusk, the ear was assailed by the\r\nmilitary watch-word; under such a system, the inhabitants could not\r\nhave been more fortunate than in the selection of General Rego for\r\ntheir governor, whose military experience was acquired with much credit\r\nin the Peninsular campaign, and whose gentlemanly and friendly conduct\r\nwould tend to soften the rigours of a military occupation of the town.\r\nTo the ready assistance and attention of the governor to all matters in\r\nwhich their interests are concerned, the English merchants bear their\r\nunited testimony.\r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas holidays, and the hottest weather, Poço de\r\nPanela, Ponta de Cho, and the neighbouring, and more distant villages\r\nof Monteiro (the road to which partly leads by a bridle-way through\r\nwoods) and of Caxanga, (where there is a spring of chalybeate water,\r\napproached also by a bye-way after crossing the river,) are fully\r\noccupied by the families of Recife, in their gayest attire and the\r\nladies are frequently seen at the windows or at the doors, the men\r\ndevoting the days of the holidays to gambling, seated in the verandas,\r\nplaying at cards or backgammon. At this season the roads are also\r\nenlivened with horsemen going their evening rounds to these places\r\nof resort. Another very pleasing excursion to Ponta de Cho, Poço de\r\nPanela, and Monteiro, is by the river Capibaribe, whose winding banks\r\nare bordered with white cottages and houses, some of a very superior\r\nappearance, also inhabited during this period, and each having a\r\nbathing house rudely enough formed of the branches of the cocoa-nut\r\ntree. Innumerable canoes are seen gliding along the river, impelled\r\nwith more velocity than by the oar or the paddle, by two vara men,\r\nwho are negroes dressed in white cotton trowsers, exhibiting all the\r\nmuscular movements of their naked arms and bodies in the exertion of\r\nusing the vara, which, when well and regularly executed, is rather\r\na graceful labour. A whole family, with furniture, and all the et\r\nceteras, are moved up the river to their summer abode in this manner;\r\nand the ladies, in their smart dresses, with French hats and white\r\nplumes nodding to the river’s breeze, do not seem to regret that it is\r\nbut transient liberty they are going to enjoy, and which they indulge\r\nin by a more free exhibition of themselves, and also by daily bathing\r\nin the river, probably two or three times, remaining in the water an\r\nhour or an hour and a half at once. They are said to be more expert\r\ndivers and swimmers than the men, and it is not rare to see parties of\r\nthem swimming about with much confidence, their hair being generally\r\nneatly dressed and bound up. One evening, on approaching the banks of\r\nthe river beyond Monteiro, with Mr. Ray, some females were bathing,\r\nand amongst them were an old gentleman and his young wife, with whom\r\nMr. R. was acquainted. We took off our hats, and the compliment was\r\nvery cordially returned by the whole party, by a low dip in the water;\r\non re-passing a considerable time afterwards we observed them still\r\nenjoying this refreshing amusement. Previously to my leaving Ponta\r\nde Cho, the _premier chuvas_ (first rains) were setting in,\r\nand the river already conveyed many canoes with families and their\r\nfurniture on the return. The heaviest rains begin about March, when\r\nthis part of the country is partially inundated and forsaken till\r\nthe dry season recommences. There are various religious festivals\r\nduring the holidays at different churches, in honour of saints. Those\r\nthat appeared to attract the most attention were at the church of\r\nthe Mount at Ollinda, at St. Amaro, and the Poço de Panela; to the\r\nlatter, the English subscribed a certain sum each. Many people were\r\nassembled, and the houses were dedicated to the purposes of gambling.\r\nThe multitude seemed to loiter about without any object, and there was\r\na deadness and want of spirit and gaiety in their general demeanor.\r\nThe church was open, which I entered in the midst of the ceremony\r\nof christening a child; a large lighted wax candle was as quickly\r\nintroduced into my hand, and I was thus enlisted into the ranks. A band\r\nof music was playing in the gallery, to dissipate the shrill notes of\r\nthe youngster, who was fingered rather roughly by the padre in the\r\ncourse of various ceremonies he performed, and in which he applied a\r\nconsiderable portion of salt. When the infant, after undergoing the\r\nlast form of having a silver crown placed upon its head, was returned\r\nto its mother, it appeared quite exhausted; and a pretty general round\r\nof embracing concluded the ceremony. The master of the festa, and his\r\nwife and daughters were there: the females were splendidly dressed,\r\nbut the absence of the graces prevented these adornments from having\r\ntheir due effect upon the imagination. The fire-works supplied by the\r\nsubscription, and which concluded this festival, were, I understood,\r\nvery indifferent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE HOUSE OF THE SENHOR D’ENGENHO DE TORRE. NEAR\r\n  PERNAMBUCO.]\r\n\r\nThe Christmas holidays are deemed by the merchants a great interruption\r\nto commerce, as no shipments can be made or business transacted during\r\nthat period. The English establishments here amount to sixteen, and\r\nthrough their medium this province is supplied with every species of\r\nEnglish manufactures. They labour, as has been previously stated, under\r\nconsiderable difficulties, in consequence of the mal-operation of\r\nthe pauta. The produce shipped from hence, consists principally of\r\ncotton and sugar; of the latter, about twenty-five thousand cases\r\nannually, nearly one-half to England, and the remainder to Lisbon:\r\nthe quantity of the former averages about eighty thousand bags, sixty\r\nthousand being sent to Great Britain, and the remainder principally to\r\nLisbon. The Pernambuco cotton is the best in the Brazil, arising in\r\npart from the rigid inspection which it undergoes. A new inspection\r\nhouse was erected here, upon the beach, called the Forte do Matto, in\r\nthe year 1815. The cotton is bought by the merchant at a certain price,\r\nwhen it is submitted to inspection and divided into three qualities;\r\nfor the second quality, which is permitted to pass with the first, the\r\nmerchant receives an allowance of five hundred reas per arrobe, from\r\nthe planter; the third quality is totally rejected. The bags are then\r\nweighed for the merchant to pay the export duty, and as one bag is\r\nonly weighed at a time, there has been considerable delay in getting\r\nthe cotton through the inspection house for shipment. The present\r\ngovernor attended here, and attempted to make arrangements for weighing\r\nthe cotton quicker, but matters shortly afterwards reverted to their\r\nanterior state. Sugar is classed into nine different qualities, and\r\ndistinguished by the following marks, commencing with the finest and\r\ncontinuing by gradations downwards.\r\n\r\n    B F  _Branco Fino_.     }\r\n    R F  _Ridondo Fino_.    }\r\n    B R  _Branco Ridondo_.  } Paying a shipping duty of sixty\r\n    R B  _Ridondo Branco_.  } reas per arrobe.\r\n    B B  _Branco Baixo_.    }\r\n    B I  _Baixo Inferior_.  }\r\n\r\n    MM  _Muscovado Macho_.  }\r\n    MR  _Muscovado Retame_. } Ditto of thirty reas per arrobe.\r\n    MB  _Muscovado Brame_.  }\r\n\r\nThe sugar engenhos are some of them very considerable, and the two\r\naccompanying plates are representations of the exterior and interior of\r\nthe Engenho de Torre not far from the right margin of the Capibaribe.\r\nThe owner, who has amassed a respectable property, very politely\r\nallowed four gentlemen with myself to see this establishment. The\r\njuice is extracted by the compressure of the cane between three\r\nupright rollers, the centre one moving the other two, and being itself\r\nconstantly carried round by relays of mares, which have a singular\r\nappearance from their ears being closely cropped. The juice flows\r\nalong a channel to a lower apartment in the building, where it goes\r\nthrough the different processes of boiling, and when completed is much\r\ninferior to the West-Indian sugar, and generally in a very dirty state.\r\n\r\nThe English merchants were desirous of getting a clergyman from\r\nEngland, having been without the performance of divine service for a\r\nconsiderable period; and, besides the want of an opportunity to fulfil\r\none of the most essential and important duties in life, an unfavourable\r\nimpression could not but operate against them in the minds of the\r\ninhabitants, from their having no public observance of religion. The\r\ncontribution fund, in the hands of the committee, amounts to upwards of\r\nfive thousand pounds, which those gentlemen have been anxious to apply\r\nto the purposes for which it is intended, that of building a church\r\nand an hospital, and the payment of a clergyman and a medical man,\r\nwhich latter appointment is filled by Dr. Ramsay, a gentleman of great\r\nacquirements in his profession, and deservedly and universally beloved\r\nand esteemed.\r\n\r\nI accompanied him and some of the merchants, upon one occasion, amongst\r\nmany others in which they had been endeavouring to obtain suitable\r\nbuildings for a church, hospital, and residences for the doctor and a\r\nclergyman. The building which we saw had been recently erected, was\r\nvery spacious, surrounded with some grounds, and well adapted for the\r\npurpose; the reason it was not rented or purchased arose from the\r\nproprietor demanding an exorbitant price.[42]\r\n\r\nWe, at the same time, paid a visit to Mr. Koster, (a gentleman known to\r\nthe literary world by the publication of his travels in the northern\r\npart of the Brazil,) who had just arrived at Recife from Goyanna, from\r\nwhence, in consequence of his indifferent state of health, he travelled\r\nin a net suspended between two horses, which was rendered, he said,\r\na less disagreeable mode of conveyance, by the ambling pace of the\r\nhorses. Mr. Koster had removed his residence to Goyanna, in hopes that\r\nthe climate would be more suitable to his health and constitution; but\r\nhis very delicate appearance indicated a rapid decline, and I regret to\r\nsay that he did not long survive.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _On Stone by C. Shoosmith from a Sketch by Ja^s Henderson._\r\n    _Printed by C. Hullmandel._\r\n\r\n  THE SUGAR ENGENHO DE TORRE, AND A PLAN OF ITS INTERIOR.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE SITE AND REMAINS OF FRIBOURG HOUSE, FORMERLY THE\r\n  RESIDENCE OF PRINCE MAURICE OF NASSAU.]\r\n\r\nThe population of Pernambuco is estimated at about sixty-five thousand\r\npersons, St. Antonio containing much the greatest proportion. I\r\nendeavoured to discover the site and remains of Fribourg House, the\r\nfirst edifice built upon it by Prince Maurice of Nassau; and was\r\nfinally assured that its remains constitute the present Casa de\r\nFazenda Real, which, though exhibiting some antiquity in its aspect,\r\nin consequence of being white-washed, could not be identified with\r\npositive certainty. But its appearance, (pretty correctly represented\r\nin the plate,) combined with the tradition that it is actually\r\nthe remains of Fribourg House, does not leave much room to doubt the\r\nfact. The convent fronting it has a great many cocoa-nut trees, which\r\nno doubt are the fruits of those he so copiously planted upon the\r\nisland. A Prince who did so much for Pernambuco, in so short a time,\r\nand who here built the first two bridges that were known in the Brazil,\r\nis not undeserving of some monument in this place to his memory. There\r\nis a theatre in St. Antonio; but the performances are exceedingly\r\nindifferent, and the house, which is small, but thinly attended, no\r\nspirit existing for the encouragement of such an establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\n                         PROVINCE OF PARAHIBA.\r\n\r\n   _Extent--Capitania of Itamaraca--Slow Advancement--Taken by\r\n   the Dutch--Restoration--Capes and Ports--Rivers--Mountains--\r\n   Zoology--Phytology--Povoaçoes--Capital--British Establishments\r\n   --Produce._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis province was originally the capitania of Itamaraca, or rather it\r\ncomprehends almost two-thirds of it, not comprising at the present\r\nday more than sixty miles of coast, computing from the river Goyanna\r\nto the bay of Marcos, which is three miles to the north of the\r\nriver Camaratiba; the province of Pernambuco having taken twenty to\r\ntwenty-five miles from it on the southern side, and Rio Grande fifteen\r\nto twenty on the northern.\r\n\r\nThe capitania of Itamaraca was never more than a portion of that which\r\nJohn III. gave to Pedro Lopez de Souza in 1534. The other portion of\r\nthis donation selected in the immediate vicinity of his brother’s\r\ncapitania of St. Vincente, was denominated St. Amaro; and Itamaraca,\r\nbeing situated at so great a distance from it, experienced less\r\nattention, and was so much neglected that, forty years afterwards,\r\nthere was not an establishment except in the island of Itamaraca, where\r\nthe colonists did not exceed two hundred families, with three sugar\r\nworks; and the French entered without interruption the ports of the\r\ncontinent in search of Brazil wood.\r\n\r\nIt is affirmed that the parish of Nossa Senhora of Conceiçao, in\r\nthe island of Itamaraca, was the first povoaçao, and also for a\r\nconsiderable period the capital of the capitania; but, as the year of\r\nits foundation is not known, we are left in ignorance as to the precise\r\nepoch of the disembarkation of the first colonists.\r\n\r\nIn the short reign of King Henry, in consequence of the incapacity of\r\nthe donatory to promote its colonization, Joam Tavarez was ordered by\r\nthe governor-general, Lourenco da Veyga, to proceed to this capitania,\r\nfor the purpose of founding a prezidio in the island of Camboa,\r\nsituated in the river Parahiba; which was removed by Captain Fructicozo\r\nBarboza to the situation of Cabedello, where being greatly annoyed\r\nby the Indians, Manuel Telles, governor of Bahia, despatched Diogo\r\nBaldez, in the year 1583, to afford him the necessary succour. The\r\nIndians and the French, who were their auxiliars, sustained a defeat;\r\nand Francisco Castrejon, commandant of a fort, which he had then\r\nconstructed, would not recognise Fructicozo Barboza as superior, which\r\ninduced the latter to retire, and the result was an invasion by the\r\nIndians, who compelled Castrejon to desert this post.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Pernambuco, Barboza returned with some companies,\r\nand having restored all the fortifications, he gave the origin to a\r\npovoaçao, which in the year 1585 was ennobled with the title of city,\r\nand called Fillippea. Its population had already arrived at seven\r\nhundred families, with twenty sugar works, when the Dutch, who had\r\nobtained possession of Pernambuco and Itamaraca, determined to conquer\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter various attempts, during two years, which were always frustrated,\r\nit fell into the hands of General Segismundo Escup, in consequence of\r\nthe capitulation of the fort of Cabedello, on the 19th of December,\r\n1634, who substituted for it the appellation of Margarida, in honour\r\nof a Dutch matron. With its reduction, and the surrender of the fort\r\nof St. Antonio four days after, the whole province passed under the\r\ndominion of the Dutch, till their evacuation of this part of the Brazil\r\nin the year 1654.\r\n\r\nIt lies between 6° 15′ and 7° 15′ south latitude, and extends two\r\nhundred and ten miles at its greatest width from east to west.\r\n\r\nThe longest day in the year does not exceed twelve hours and a half.\r\nThe winter commences at the equinox of March, and continues till\r\nJuly, and is never severe. The climate is warm, but refreshed by the\r\ndelightful breezes with which it is visited from the sea. More than\r\ntwo-thirds of the face of the country, generally uneven, consists of\r\ncatingas, the remainder is of strong substantial and fertile soils,\r\ncovered with extensive woods, principally upon serras of the greatest\r\nelevation, and in the vicinities of some rivers; and it is only in\r\nthose latter districts, partially divested of their primitive sylvan\r\nshades, that cultivation is to be seen, comprised in plantations of the\r\ncotton tree, sugar cane, mandioca, Indian corn, legumes, tobacco, with\r\nsome rice; and also the hortulans and fruits peculiar to the climate,\r\nincluding the pine-apple, water-melon, banana, and the orange, which\r\nare of excellent flavour.\r\n\r\nCAPES AND ISLANDS.--Point Cabedello, south of the embouchure\r\nof the river Parahiba; Point Lucena, six miles north of the preceding;\r\nand Cape Branco, fifteen miles south of the first, are the principal.\r\n\r\nThere are no islands upon the coast of this province but in the mouths\r\nof rivers or the entrances of bays, and they are generally small.\r\n\r\nPORTS.--That within the river Parahiba is the most frequented.\r\nThe bay of Traicao, originally Acejutibiro, in the form of a half moon,\r\nwith three entrances formed by two small islands, almost eight miles\r\nin width, having a small river at the extremity, is deemed the best\r\nport of the province, and capable of receiving a considerable number\r\nof small vessels. The northern entrance is almost two miles in width.\r\nFrom this bay a reef extends nearly eighteen miles to Cape Branco,\r\nbetween which and the beach there are nine and ten fathoms of depth,\r\nwhere vessels anchor in smooth water, protected from the agitation of\r\nthe ocean by this recife, which is a portion of the celebrated chain\r\nextending along the coast, elevating its head occasionally above the\r\nwater, as at Pernambuco, and in other latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Lucena, on the northern side of the point of the same name,\r\nis large, with a good anchorage, but is exposed to winds prevailing\r\nfrom north to east.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The Parahiba, from which the province takes its name,\r\noriginates in the district of the Cayriris Velhos, in the skirts of\r\nthe serra of Jabitaca, near the source of the Capibaribe, runs to the\r\neast-north-east, and is considerable only in the vicinity of the ocean,\r\ninto which it is discharged by two mouths, separated by the island\r\nof St. Bento, which is about three miles in extent. As the territory\r\nin which it rises is of a sandy nature, it becomes a stream in that\r\ndistrict only during the period of the rains, nor does it receive till\r\nafter half its course, any of those tributary currents which render it\r\nnavigable for a considerable space. Ships advance up only a few miles,\r\nsumacas to the capital, and canoes as far as the town of Pilar. From\r\nhence upwards, its bed is stony, with many falls and currents rendering\r\ndifficult or entirely impeding navigation. It does not abound in any\r\npart with fish. In the proximity of the sea it is wide and handsome,\r\nthe margins being adorned with mangroves.\r\n\r\nThe Guarahu, which is the largest of its confluents, unites it on the\r\nleft, not far from the capital.\r\n\r\nThe Mamanguape, which is handsome, and affords an advantageous\r\nnavigation to the planters upon its adjacent lands, enters the ocean by\r\ntwo mouths, divided by a flat island covered with mangroves, between\r\nwhich and the chain of reefs, which arrests all the fury of the sea,\r\nthere is an excellent anchorage place, where vessels lie in dead water,\r\nto which a narrow aperture amongst the reefs affords a passage, with\r\nthree fathoms of depth, and is little more than ten miles to the north\r\nof Point Lucena.\r\n\r\nThe Grammame, originally Guaramama, which discharges itself between\r\nPort Francez and Cape Branco, has a large wooden bridge over it, on the\r\nroad from Goyanna to the city of Parahiba. It is only navigable as far\r\nas the tide advances.\r\n\r\nThe Cammaratiba, which enters the sea ten miles north of the bay of\r\nTraicao, and the Popoca, which discharges itself six miles to the north\r\nof the Goyanna, are also navigable with the tide.\r\n\r\nIn the western part is the Piranhas, which has acquired the name of\r\nthe fish with which it abounds. Its source is at the base of the\r\nserra of Cayriris, and after seventy miles of course to the north, it\r\ngathers on the left the river Peixe, which comes from the serra of Luiz\r\nGomez, with fifty miles of extent, always flowing through campinhas,\r\nwhere there are a great many emu-ostriches, and in its vicinity have\r\nbeen found gold and silver. Twenty-five miles below this confluence,\r\nit receives on the right the Pinhanco, which is little inferior to\r\nit, also flowing from the serra of Cayriris, in a serpentine course\r\nthrough an extensive district, abounding with cattle belonging to\r\nvarious fazendeiros, or breeders, who live dispersed about in different\r\nsituations. After a long course, having become considerable by other\r\nstreams, it enters the province of Rio Grande in its way to the ocean.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--Almost all the mountains with which this province is\r\ninterspersed, are arms of the serra Borborema, commencing near the sea,\r\nwithin the province of Rio Grande, which traverse it from north-east\r\nto south-west, dividing it into two parts, east and west. The latter,\r\ndenominated Cayriris Novas, is an elevated country, and being refreshed\r\nwith winds is wholesome, and also considerably wider than the eastern\r\nportion. January, February, March, and April, are here the most rainy\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIn the serra of Teyxeira, which is a portion of the Borborema, there\r\nare some inscriptions with green ink, in characters unknown to the\r\nadjacent inhabitants, but which are reputed to be the work of the\r\nDutch, or the Flamengos, as they are yet called here.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--All the domestic animals of the Portuguese peninsula,\r\nmultiply here without degenerating much. In the woods are seen the\r\n_anta_, deer, ounce, boar, monkey, _quaxinin_, _preguica_, or sloth,\r\n_paca_, _quaty_, and other quadrupeds common to the neighbouring\r\nprovinces. There is here a species of ferret, the size of a cat, and\r\nresembling the _quaty_, with which the hunters draw from their burrows\r\nthe _moco_ and the _preha_. If the animal perceive a snake in the hole\r\nit will not enter. It does not appear to be known southward of the St.\r\nFrancisco. Amongst the birds are observed the emu-ostrich, _seriema_,\r\n_jacu_, _zabele_, quail, parrot, _rolla_, _sabia_, troquaze pigeon,\r\ncanary, _cardal_, wild duck, _colhereira_, heron, _jaburu_, _socco_, a\r\ndiversity of the _macarico_, and the sparrowhawk. The _arraponga_ has\r\nthe feathers black upon the back. The _puppeyro_, which is the size\r\nof a blackbird, with the bill of a pigeon, blue back, the breast red,\r\nand the tail when opened of beautiful colours, is only met with in the\r\nwoods of the serras. Two Indian nations were the possessors of this\r\ncountry. The _Cahetes_, from the river Parahiba to the south, and the\r\n_Potyguaras_ to the north; each tribe is divided into various hordes,\r\nand the whole have been christianized many years since.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--Cedar, Brazil wood, _aroeira_, _pereira_, _batinga_, which\r\nis yellow, iron and violet wood, _fava-de-cheiro_, (a species of\r\npulse,) which grows in pods, and whose bean is deemed excellent for\r\nremoving hoarseness; _sipipira_, bow-wood, heart of negro, _anjico_,\r\n_angellim_, _jatuba_, the cupahyba oil, and gum-mastick trees. In the\r\nwoods where these trees grow, and where there are others for building,\r\nare also met with fruit trees growing without any human aid, such\r\nas the _jabuticaba_, _pitomba_, _goyaba_, _cajue_, _ambuzo_, and\r\n_aracaza_. The _mangaba_ is very abundant in some parts. The cocoa-nut\r\ntree abounds along the coast, which in parts is sandy, in others rocky,\r\nor covered with mangroves. The _catulez_ is a sort of large palm tree,\r\nthe fruit of which affords aliment to cattle. The _piki_ is a middling\r\nsized tree, its fruit round, of the size of an apple, with a green\r\nrind, and a large prickly stone, the almond of which is eaten roasted\r\nor raw; the pulp is white and soft, and is also eaten; an oil is\r\nlikewise extracted from it, and used for seasoning.\r\n\r\nThis province produced formerly much excellent sugar, the culture of\r\nwhich has diminished considerably in consequence of the great droughts\r\nwhich are frequently experienced; but in its place cotton has greatly\r\nincreased, as it resists the heat better, and at the present time does\r\nnot leave a less profit to the cultivator.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of this province are the following towns:\r\n\r\n    Parahiba\r\n    Pilar\r\n    Alhandra\r\n    Villa Real\r\n    Villa do Conde\r\n    Villa da Rainba\r\n    St. Miguel\r\n    Montemor.\r\n\r\nIn the western part are Pombal and Villa Nova de Souza.\r\n\r\nParahiba, denominated a city, in a state of mediocrity and populous,\r\nis situated upon the right bank, ten miles above the embouchure of\r\nthe river of its name, near the confluence of the small river Unhaby.\r\nIt is ornamented with a house of misericordia and its hospital; a\r\nconvent of Franciscans, another of slippered Carmelites, and a third\r\nof Benedictines; five hermitages, that of Bom Jesus for the soldiers,\r\nSanto Cruz, St. Pedro Gonsalves, Our Lady of Rozario for the blacks,\r\nand May dos Homens for the mulattoes; also two handsome fountains of\r\ngood water. It is the capital of the province, the residence of its\r\ngovernor, and of the ouvidor, whose jurisdiction extends also to the\r\nprovince of Rio Grande. It has its high-sounding royal professors of\r\nthe primitive letters and Latin, and a junta of real fazenda, (the\r\ntreasury.) Its only mother church is dedicated to Nossa Senhora das\r\nNeves. The Jesuits had a college here, which serves at the present day\r\nfor the palace of the governors; they possessed another for recreation,\r\nat a distance of five miles on the beach of Tambahu, where there is an\r\nentertaining house of Franciscans. The principal streets are paved, and\r\nthere are some good houses. The river, whose entrance is defended by\r\ntwo frontier forts, a league distant, is here a mile in width, forming\r\na good port for sumacas. Ships can only advance a little higher up than\r\nthe forts. A Juiz de Fora was granted to this city in the year 1813.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch exchanged its primitive name for that of Friderica, in honour\r\nof the Prince of Orange, and presented it with a sugar-loaf for arms,\r\nin allusion to the excellent quality of that article, which was made\r\nin this district, and in pursuance of the plan they had adopted of\r\ngranting similar armorial emblems of some leading object or production\r\npeculiar to the districts or capitanias then under their dominion.\r\n\r\nAn Englishman, a Scotchman, and an Irishman have recently settled\r\nin this city, and it is to be hoped, that an union will exist in\r\ntheir commercial operations, and that they will be induced to go\r\nhand-in-hand, thereby precluding that competition, which has been\r\nalready alluded to as militating so seriously in other places against\r\nthe interest of the merchant and manufacturer. These establishments\r\nwere formed in conjunction with the merchants of Pernambuco, and\r\nfrom hence they receive supplies of manufactured goods, the returns\r\nfor which are transmitted direct to England in sugar and cotton\r\nprincipally. Besides, additional sums of specie sent from Pernambuco\r\nto those merchants for the purchase of produce, give this city the\r\nadvantage of disposing of a greater portion of the productions of the\r\nprovince than the amount of British commodities consumed in it. During\r\nmy stay at Pernambuco two or three vessels were sent from thence\r\nin ballast to Parahiba to take in produce, the major part of which\r\nwas purchased with specie remitted for the purpose, and not with the\r\nproceeds of goods sold here. The balance of specie in favour of this\r\ncity, in its interchange of commodities with the British merchant,\r\nmay arise from various causes. The two or three merchants at Rio de\r\nJaneiro, who supply the government with naval and military stores,\r\nreceive bills in payment upon the Provincial or fora treasuries, and\r\nthe specie thus and by other remittances coming into the Pernambuco\r\nmarket beyond the returns for goods sold, create an extra demand for\r\nproduce, arising from the impossibility of transmitting those funds to\r\nEngland in any other way; and thus part of the specie finds its way\r\nto this city, from an expectation of its being disposed of to better\r\nadvantage. Two circumstances concur in producing this result;--in the\r\nfirst place, a considerable part of the produce of the province of\r\nParahiba, till very recently, was brought to the market of Pernambuco;\r\nbut the measures of the governor to confine the productions of the\r\ndistrict under his jurisdiction to an exit by the head town, in\r\norder that the treasury may not be deprived of its revenue, has led\r\nto a concentration of the objects of exportation in this city, a\r\ndirect transit to England being opened for them by the establishments\r\nmentioned, and whose object, in forwarding them at a lower rate than\r\nfrom Pernambuco, is at all events in the second place accomplished by\r\nan exemption from consulage duties.\r\n\r\nOne of the merchants settled here visited Pernambuco in the early part\r\nof 1820, whilst I was there, and purchased a cargo of _bacalhao_,\r\nor salt fish, from Newfoundland, being the sixth vessel which had\r\narrived at Recife so laden in the course of two months, and this was\r\nthe first entire cargo that had sailed from Pernambuco to Parahiba,\r\ndemonstrating that this city is in a progressive state of commercial\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nIn its environs the necessaries of life are cultivated, and the sugar\r\ncane, for which there are various engenhos, principally going by water.\r\nTowards the interior plantations of the cotton tree are to be seen,\r\nespecially in the certam of Crumatahu.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the revolution at Pernambuco, which is said to have\r\nextended its baneful consequences to this province, particularly to the\r\nvicinity of this city, where the sugar is principally grown, the export\r\nof that article exceeded nine hundred chests annually, each containing\r\nfifty arrobas, or sixteen hundred pounds; but in 1819 the amount did\r\nnot reach much above four hundred chests.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding sugar has diminished, the production of cotton is\r\nincreasing rapidly. In 1816 it was nine thousand bags; in 1819 it\r\nreached seventeen thousand bags of five to five and a half arrobas\r\neach; and in the year 1820 it was confidently anticipated to reach\r\ntwenty to twenty-four thousand bags.\r\n\r\nThe campinhas of this province, which afford cattle to the capital,\r\nand in part to Pernambuco and Bahia, when visited by two or three\r\nsucceeding seasons of drought, entirely lose their vegetation, and\r\nthe streams disappear, so that a mortality ensues amongst the cattle,\r\ncarrying them off in great numbers.\r\n\r\nThe governor of this city is endeavouring to effect some improvement\r\nin the roads, or rather tracks, through the province, which are in\r\nthe same lamentable condition as in all other districts, and it is\r\nsincerely to be wished that his efforts may not be fruitless. He has\r\nissued orders for all individuals to make roads through their lands.\r\n\r\nTen miles from this city, and upon the margin of the same river, is the\r\nconsiderable arraial of St. Rita, with a hermitage so called.\r\n\r\nPilar do Taypu, forty miles above the capital upon the left bank of\r\nthe Parahiba, is ornamented with a church of N. Senhora of Pilar.\r\nCariri was its primitive name, when an aldeia of Indians, its first\r\ninhabitants, and who even at this day form, with their descendants, the\r\nprincipal portion of its population, cultivating in its environs a good\r\nquantity of cotton, mandioca, &c.\r\n\r\nNine miles from it is the arraial and parish of Tayabanna, upon the\r\nmargin of the same river; and ten miles to the north is that of\r\nCannufistula, with a hermitage; both grow much cotton. Gurunhem is upon\r\na small river of the same name, with a chapel of N. Senhora of Rozario.\r\n\r\nNear the Parahiba, and two miles from the town of Pilar, is the parish\r\nof St. Miguel; cotton is the wealth of its parishioners.\r\n\r\nAlhandra, originally Urathauhy, is a middling town, and well situated\r\nnear the river Capibary, nine miles north-east of Goyanna, and seven\r\nfrom the sea; it has a church dedicated to N. Senhora of Assumpçao. Its\r\ninhabitants are composed of Indians and whites, pure and intermixed,\r\nand are agriculturists and fishermen.\r\n\r\nVilla do Conde, formerly Japoca, is yet small and without any thing\r\nremarkable. It has a church of the Lady of Conceiçao, and is about\r\neighteen miles south of the capital, and near fifteen from the sea.\r\nIts inhabitants, Indians, whites, and mesticos, cultivate divers\r\nnecessaries of life, and draw their water from a good fountain.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Miguel, situated near a lake in the proximity of the\r\nbay of Trabicao, has the aspect of a small aldeia. Its church is\r\ndedicated to the archangel whose name it takes. Its inhabitants are\r\nIndians, and draw their subsistence from the same occupations as the\r\npreceding places.\r\n\r\nMontemor is a vilota, or small town of the descendants of the\r\naborigines, one mile from the northern margin of the Mamanguape, and\r\nfifteen from the sea. It had its commencement six miles more distant,\r\nwhere the parish of St. Pedro and St. Paulo is situated, for the\r\nhabitation of the ancestors of its present inhabitants. The number of\r\nwhites having greatly increased, and in order to avoid the dissensions\r\nwhich originated with the two hierarchies, it became expedient to\r\nseparate them; for which purpose a new aldeia was founded with the\r\nname of Preguica, for the establishment of the first, in the situation\r\nwhere the town is. Its church is dedicated to the Lady of Prazeres.\r\nThe senate of this town resides in the parish of St. Pedro and St.\r\nPaulo, better known by the name of Mamanguape, in consequence of being\r\nnear that river. In the year 1813, when its population and that of its\r\nextensive district, had nearly reached fifteen thousand adults, it was\r\ndismembered of its western portion for the creation of the parish of N.\r\nSenhora of Conceiçao do Brejo d’Area.\r\n\r\nVilla Real. By a law of the 17th of June, 1815, the above new parish\r\nof Conceiçao, was created a town, with the name of Villa Real do Brejo\r\nd’Area, its civil government being assisted by two ordinary judges and\r\nthree _vereadores_, or aldermen, with other officers common to\r\ntowns of the same order. It is seventy miles from Montemor, and cotton\r\nis its principal production.\r\n\r\nVilla da Rainha, vulgarly called Campinha Grande, (Large Plain),\r\nin consequence of being a solitary place, in an extensive plain,\r\none hundred and twenty miles west of the capital, is yet a small\r\ntown, much frequented, however, in consequence of the royal road,\r\n(estrada-real) as it is ludicrously called, of the certam. Paupinna was\r\nits name previously to its becoming a town. Its inhabitants drink of a\r\ncontiguous lake, which failing of water in the years of great drought,\r\nobliges them to fetch it upwards of six miles. Its church is dedicated\r\nto the Lady of Conceiçao.\r\n\r\nPombal, a considerable town, speaking comparatively with others of the\r\ncountry, is well situated upon the river Pinhanco, four miles above its\r\nmouth, and one hundred and fifty miles south of Villa Nova da Princeza,\r\na town of Rio Grande. It has for nominal patroness the Lady of Bom\r\nSuccesso (good success.) Its inhabitants, mostly whites, live upon the\r\nproduce of agriculture, and of cattle, which are not numerous.\r\n\r\nVilla Nova de Souza is situated upon the margin of the river Peixe,\r\nten miles above its mouth, thirty-five from Pombal, and has a church\r\nof the Lady of Remedios. The inhabitants cultivate legumes, sugar,\r\nwater-melons, and melons, in the vicinity of the rivers; and on the\r\nserras, mandioca, cotton, and Indian corn; in the catingas cattle\r\npasture, and abound with a diversity of game. In the year 1806, there\r\nwas scarcely an orange tree in the districts of the last two towns,\r\nwhere all the trees are bent to the west, in consequence of the\r\nconstant and sometimes impetuous east wind that prevails here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\n                 PROVINCE OF RIO GRANDE DO NORTE.[43]\r\n\r\n   _Contests with Indians--Conquest--Taken by the Dutch--\r\n   Restored--Extent--Sterility of Soil--Capes and Ports--\r\n   Mineralogy--Mountains--Zoology--Phytology--Rivers and\r\n   Lakes--Povoações--Island of Fernando de Noronha._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conquest of this province, which is a portion of the capitania of\r\nJoam de Barros, was commenced in the year 1597, by order of Philip II.\r\nwith the intention of impeding the exportation of Brazil wood by the\r\nFrench, and of overcoming the Potyguaras, who destroyed the plantations\r\nof the colonists of Parahiba, and interrupted the progress of that\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nD. Francisco de Souza, governor of the state, by orders which he\r\nreceived, supplied what was requisite from the royal treasury. The\r\nsquadron which was prepared at Pernambuco, and carried with it a Jesuit\r\nfor an engineer, and a Franciscan to interpret the language of the\r\nIndians, directed its course to the mouth of Rio Grande, which was the\r\nport most visited by the Corsairs. The enterprise had its commencement\r\nby the construction of a wooden fort, near the place where the Fort\r\ndos Reys is now situated, and the first commandant of which, Jeronimo\r\nd’ Albuquerque, had many obstinate combats with the aborigines for\r\nmore than a year, until the friendship which he established with\r\nSorobabe, (Great Island,) chief of the Indians, through the mediation\r\nof a friendly one of the same tribe, afforded him an opportunity\r\nof laying the foundation of the city of Natal, which received this\r\nname in consequence of the inauguration of its mother church, in\r\n1599, happening on the same day as the festivity of the birth of our\r\nSaviour. The want of better ports, the quality of the land, which did\r\nnot encourage its colonization, and the Portuguese nation being then\r\nunder the dominion of the Castilian crown, as well as the inconstancy\r\nof the Indians, equally unserviceable as friends, as they were fatal\r\nwhen enemies, concurred to prevent this colony from acquiring any\r\nconsiderable augmentation during thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, after being established in Pernambuco, presented themselves\r\nseveral times before the Fort dos Reys, (of Kings,) which always\r\nresisted their attacks, until it was ultimately delivered to them by\r\nthe treason of a sergeant, a deserter from Bahia, who stole the keys\r\nof the fort by night, the commandant being seriously wounded, and\r\ncommunicated to Admiral Ceulio, that the garrison would deliver itself\r\nup, according to the conditions offered to the commandant and rejected\r\nby him. Ceulio perceiving at day-break a white flag hoisted, proceeded\r\nimmediately towards the fort, which made very little resistance, in\r\nconsequence of this traitor, and one Orteguera, also an enemy to\r\nthe commandant, vigorously counselling him to give it up. With the\r\npossession of this fort, the Dutch became masters of the province,\r\nwhich was restored with the others in the year 1654.\r\n\r\nIn the same year John IV. gave part of this province to Manuel Jurdao,\r\nwho perished by shipwreck at the point of disembarkation, and in\r\nconsequence of whose death the country reverted to the crown. This\r\nprovince had for some time the title of countship, created in 1689,\r\nin favour of Lopo Furtado de Mendonca. It is confined on the north\r\nand east by the ocean, on the south by the province of Parahiba,\r\nand on the west by that of Siara, from which it is separated by the\r\nserra of Appody, which is about a league to the west of the river so\r\ncalled. It lies between 4° 10′ and 6° 15′ south latitude; the days\r\nand nights differ very little in length all the year. The climate is\r\nhot and healthy. The winter, commonly not abundant in rain, continues\r\nfrom April to June in the eastern part; in the western scarcely any\r\nother rains fall, but those which accompany thunder, beginning usually\r\nin January or February. It comprises one hundred and seventy miles\r\nfrom east to west, in the greatest width, and one hundred from north\r\nto south, on the western side. The face of the country is generally\r\nuneven, and presents some mountains of considerable altitude, and also\r\nwoods, but they are rare, and of no great extent, the greatest portion\r\nconsisting of parched catingas. Notwithstanding the soil in various\r\nparts is adapted to the plantation of the cane, its culture was never\r\nconsiderable, and it gradually diminishes; cotton being substituted\r\nfor it almost in all parts, with less expense and equal profit to\r\nthe planter. Mandioca, Indian corn, legumes, and hortulans of the\r\ncountry, are generally cultivated, as well as some rice and tobacco in\r\nsufficient quantity for the population.\r\n\r\nNegroes are not numerous in this province; the Indians, who were very\r\nferocious, have all been reduced many years, and their descendants,\r\nthrough the medium of alliances with the Europeans and Africans,\r\nhave augmented the classes of whites and mulattoes, who for the most\r\npart indulge in idleness, and improperly deem it a degradation to\r\napply their personal labour, with instruments of agriculture, for the\r\nimprovement of their country.\r\n\r\nCAPES AND PORTS.--Cape St. Roque forms the angle of this\r\nregion to the north-east.\r\n\r\nPoint Pipa took its name from a stone, in a degree resembling a tunnel,\r\ncaused by the sea continually beating against it. A little to the south\r\nof this point there are four abundant fountains of soft water upon the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nPoint Negra is seven miles to the north of the preceding, and almost as\r\nfar south of the river Tareyri.\r\n\r\nPoint Petetinga, Point Toiro, Point Tres Irmaos, Point Tubarao, between\r\nthe rivers Aguamare and the Amargoso, and Point Mel, which is between\r\nthe Appody and the Conchas, are all upon the northern coast of the\r\nprovince. It has neither ports nor bays capable of receiving a squadron\r\nof ships of much burden; there is, however, the Bay Formoza upon the\r\neastern coast, with seven miles of mouth, three of bay, and four\r\nfathoms in depth at low water, but it is overspread with stones and\r\nunsheltered.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--It has gold, minerals of iron and silver, flint stones,\r\ncalcareous stone, granite, amethysts, crystals, and argils of various\r\ncolours and quality.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The serra Estrella is in nothing comparable with that of\r\nthe same name in the province of Beyra.\r\n\r\nThe serra St. Cosme, with a hermitage, St. Domingos, St. Joze, Camelo,\r\nwith eighteen miles of length, and Pannaty, at the heads of the\r\nPinhanco; Bonito, from whence a small torrent descends, denominated\r\nAguaboa, (Good Water;) Camara, Pattu, with a hermitage of the Lady of\r\nImpossibilities, and in its skirts another of the Lady of Griefs; Luiz\r\nGomez, covered with large woods, and where the best necessaries of life\r\nand cotton are raised; that of Cabello-naotem, so called in consequence\r\nof being entirely bare, having gold; Regente, now called Portalegre,\r\nsince a town of that name was founded upon it; Campo Grande in the\r\nvicinity of the preceding, and whose inhabitants belong to the parish\r\nof Pau dos Ferros, two miles distant; Martins, which has ten miles of\r\nlength, and a hermitage on the summit, near a lake, that overflows\r\nits margins with the thunder showers. It is affirmed, that at the end\r\nof the last century there was already upon the serra four thousand\r\npersons belonging to the communion. Serra Borborema is in the eastern\r\npart of the province.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--Cattle are bred, and some mules; also sheep and goats. Hogs\r\nare not so numerous as in the adjacent provinces. In the woods the\r\nsame quadrupeds are met with as in the surrounding districts. The emu\r\nostrich, _seriema_, _guiraponga_, _tucano_, _zabele_, torquaze-pigeon,\r\nand parrot, are well known; also the _beija-flor_, or humming bird,\r\n_sabia_, _cardal_, canary, _cabore_, _carrica_, and _papeyro_. On the\r\nmargins of the rivers and lakes are the heron, _jaburu_, _colhereira_,\r\n_galleiroe_, _socco_, and various sorts of the _macarico_. The\r\n_jucurutu_ and the _macauhan_ are destroyers of snakes.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--The cocoa-nut tree is abundant in many situations near\r\nthe beach. In the interior there are many species of the palm. In the\r\nwoods are divers trees of excellent timber, and some resinous. The\r\ncedar is not unknown in all the districts. Amongst fruits are the\r\ncajue, _jabuticaba_, _ambuzo_, _aracaza_, and occasionally groves,\r\nalmost entirely of the _mangaba_ tree, are met with; there is also the\r\ncupahyba tree, and a variety of other vegetation used in pharmacy.\r\nLights are universally made from the oil of mamona and bees-wax.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND LAKES.--Rio Grande, originally Pottengy, comes\r\nfrom the centre of the province, increasing with the waters of various\r\nothers, generally inconsiderable, and discharges itself fifteen miles\r\nto the south of Cape St. Roque. The margins are in great part covered\r\nwith handsome mangroves as far as the tide advances. Large barks\r\nproceed up for the space of near forty miles, from thence upwards only\r\ncanoes.\r\n\r\nThe Appody has one hundred and thirty miles of course, formerly\r\ndenominated Upanema, a name which at present is appropriated to another\r\nsmaller river that unites it, on the right, ten miles above its mouth.\r\nIt runs almost wholly through a flat country, where there are various\r\nlakes, which by degrees restore to it the waters introduced into them\r\nby its floods.\r\n\r\nThe waters of those lakes, amongst which are the Apanhapeixe, (Catch\r\nFish,) about four miles in circuit; Pacco, a little less, and Varges,\r\nsix miles long and narrow, totally disappear in years of drought.\r\nLarge canoes advance up this river to the arraial of St. Luzia,\r\nsituated upon the left margin, twenty miles from the sea. From this\r\nsituation downwards the famous salterns of Mossoro are met with, the\r\nsalt of which is as white as snow; they have tended to the increase of\r\npopulation, as well as occasioned the river to be visited by a great\r\nnumber of small craft, which convey it to different parts.\r\n\r\nThe Aguamare runs northward, like the preceding, and is discharged\r\ntwenty miles to the west of Point Tres Irmaos by two mouths, formed\r\nby a small island that produces salt; large canoes proceed up it some\r\nleagues. Its entrance is pointed out by two mountains, called Cambujys,\r\nof unequal elevation, both in the form of a sugar-loaf, and seven miles\r\ndistant from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Gunepabu, also called Siara Mirim, after having irrigated an\r\nextensive country, with many small aldeias, is discharged three miles\r\nnorth of the Rio Grande, with considerable width and two fathoms in\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nThe river Cunhahu, otherwise Crumatahy, which enters the ocean\r\nfive miles south of Point Pipa, waters the establishments of many\r\nfazendeiros, gathers various small rivers, and affords navigation to\r\ncanoes for some leagues.\r\n\r\nThe Tareyry, which is the outlet of Lake Groahyras, discharges itself\r\ntwenty miles south of the Rio Grande. This lake, ten miles long,\r\ncommunicates with two smaller ones, is well stored with fish, and at a\r\ncertain point is only one mile from the sea. The Guajehy empties itself\r\nfour miles to the north of the bay of Marcos.\r\n\r\nThe Piranhas (spoken of in the province of Parahiba) is here the most\r\nconsiderable river, and its largest floods are in March and April. It\r\nis discharged by five mouths, the principal of which are the eastern,\r\ncalled Amargozo, the Conchas the western, and the Cavallos the central,\r\nbeing the most voluminous, and twenty miles to the west of the\r\nAguamare; large barks proceed up to Villa Nova da Princeza. Upon its\r\nmargins are the abundant salterns of Assu, the primitive name of the\r\nriver. A great portion of the salt is consumed for salting fish, the\r\nmain part of which is sent to Pernambuco.\r\n\r\nThe Serido, which has one hundred miles of course, and the largest\r\nconfluent of the Piranhas in this province, enters on the right eighty\r\nmiles above its embouchure. An imaginary line drawn north and south\r\nfrom the point of Tres Irmaos divides this province into two parts, a\r\nlittle unequal.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part there are the following towns:--\r\n\r\n    Natal\r\n    Arez\r\n    Estremoz\r\n    St. Joze\r\n    Villaflor.\r\n\r\nIn the western part:--Villa Nova da Princesa, Portalegre, and Villa\r\nNova do Principe.\r\n\r\nNatal, which has been sometimes called Cidade dos Reys, (City of the\r\nKings,) with a church dedicated to the Lady of Apresentaçao, and the\r\ncapital, does not surpass any of the largest towns of the province:\r\nit consists of a square; the streets are of deep sand; and it is\r\ndignified with the title of a city, which it received at its foundation\r\nby the Philips. It has, as usual, various places of worship, a palace\r\nfor the governors, a town-house, and a prison. It is advantageously\r\nsituated upon the right margin of the Rio Grande, near two miles above\r\nits mouth, which is defended by the fort of Reys Majos, seated upon the\r\nsouthern point, and becoming an island with the high tides. The Dutch\r\npossessed themselves of this city in 1633, and gave it an ostrich for\r\narms, in allusion to the multiplicity of those birds with which the\r\nprovince at that time abounded. In its environs cotton, Indian corn,\r\nfeijao, and mandioca are cultivated, with some rice and sugar.\r\n\r\nArez, originally Groahyras, is a small town, with a church dedicated\r\nto St. John the Baptist, and about thirty-five miles south of the\r\ncapital, near a lake of its primitive name, and twenty miles distant\r\nfrom the sea. The inhabitants are almost all fishermen and respire a\r\nsalubrious air. The channel which the Dutch projected opening from\r\nthis lake to the beach of Tibau, only distant two miles, and which\r\nwould save a navigation of fifteen or eighteen miles by the Tareyry, is\r\nyet unexecuted. In the district of Arez is the povoaçao of Goyaninha,\r\n(Little Goyanna,) larger than the town, from which it is distant ten\r\nmiles. It is inhabited by whites, and has a church of Nossa Senhora of\r\nPrazeres.\r\n\r\nVillaflor, at first called Grammacio, is an indifferent town, inhabited\r\nby agricultural Indians and whites, with a church of the Lady of\r\nDesterro. It is forty miles to the south of the capital and three from\r\nthe sea, near the river Cunhau, which supplies it with water.\r\n\r\nEstremoz, formerly Guajiru, is a town of the same class as the\r\npreceding, well situated near a lake ten miles long and two wide.\r\nIt is ten miles from the sea and as far north-west of the capital,\r\nwith a mother church, having for patrons St. Michael and the Lady\r\nof Pleasures. The inhabitants are composed of whites, Indians, and\r\nmesticos. In the district of Estremoz, upon the northern coast, near\r\nthe mouth of a small river, is the flourishing povoaçao of Toiros,\r\noccupied by whites, and ornamented with a chapel of Lord Jesus of\r\nthe Navigators. From its port, where small vessels arrive, cotton is\r\nexported.\r\n\r\nVilla Nova da Princeza, primarily Assu, is well situated on the\r\nleft bank of the river Parinhas, twenty-five miles above its mouth,\r\nand is the most considerable and trading town of the western part;\r\nhyates frequent its port. Besides a church dedicated to St. John the\r\nBaptist there is a hermitage of the Lady of Rozario. The inhabitants\r\nbreed cattle, and cultivate the same productions as are raised in\r\nthe vicinity of the capital. The salt-pits employ many people, and\r\ntheir proceeds form a considerable branch of commerce. Villa Nova\r\ndo Principe, formerly Cayco, is a middling town, and well situated\r\nupon the river Serido, twenty-five miles above its mouth. St. Anna is\r\npatroness of the church, and the inhabitants of various complexions\r\ndrink the water of the river, upon the margins of which feijao,\r\nhortulans, Indian corn, and tobacco are cultivated. In its district\r\nthere are the hermitages of St. Anna do Pe da Serra, of St. Anna do\r\nCampo Grande, and of St. Luzia, which are expected to become parishes\r\nwith the increase of population.\r\n\r\nPortalegre is a considerable town, situated upon the serra of its\r\nname, near seventy miles from the sea and eight to the west of the\r\nAppody. St. Joam Baptista is the nominal patron of its church, and its\r\ninhabitants, composed of Europeans, whites of the country, and Indians,\r\nrespire fresh and salubrious air, and derive excellent water from two\r\nperennial founts. The Indians, whose numbers are much inferior to the\r\nwhites, are descendants principally of three colonies, which their\r\nconquerors established here, namely the _Payacus_, who possessed\r\nthe margins of the Appody, the _Icos_, who were masters of those\r\nof the river Peixe, and the _Pannaties_, who inhabited the serra\r\nof their name. Cotton and mandioca are its exports.\r\n\r\nThe eastern limits of the district of this town are common with those\r\nof the parish of St. John the Baptist of Appody. In its vicinity, near\r\na stream, below a tree, there is a small spring of tepid water, called\r\nAgua do Milho, It is necessary to draw it out with a small vessel into\r\na larger one, when any person wishes to bathe.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Joze, which took the Lady of O. for its patroness, is\r\nin a state of mediocrity, agreeably and well situated. Mipibu was its\r\nfirst name, and it is nearly thirty miles south of the capital, fifteen\r\nfrom the ocean, and three from the lake Groahyras. The inhabitants are\r\nagricultural Indians and whites.\r\n\r\nAbout four miles from it is the small povoaçao of Papary, near the lake\r\nof Groahyras, with a chapel of Our Lady of O. and inhabited by whites,\r\nwho are employed in fishing.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred and fifty miles to the east-north-east of Cape St.\r\nRoque is the island of Fernando de Noronha, discovered by a Portuguese\r\nof that name, being ten miles long, of proportionate width, generally\r\nmountainous and stony, with so few and such small portions of land\r\nsusceptible of cultivation, that it could not maintain a diminutive\r\ncolony. In order to impede a contraband trade with foreign nations,\r\na detachment is maintained here, supplied and annually exchanged from\r\nPernambuco. Some criminals are sent here to pass the period of their\r\ndegradation, who cultivate a small portion of mandioca, with some\r\nfruits from the continent, and breed some cattle, sheep, and goats. The\r\nrigid prohibition by the government of the entrance, till recently, of\r\nany female to this island with the colony, is a circumstance highly\r\ndiscreditable to their policy. A brother-in-law of General Rego\r\nreturned from the government of this island when I was at Pernambuco,\r\nand from him I understood that females were now admitted into the\r\ncolony. Rats are here exceedingly numerous, also the rolla bird. There\r\nare a great number of wild mountain cats, descended from those which\r\nhad fled from the houses; they carry on a continued warfare against the\r\nrolla. It has good water, and eight or ten small forts, destined to\r\ndefend those places where a disembarkation might be effected. In the\r\nyear 1738 King John V. ordered these fortifications to be constructed,\r\nafter the expulsion of the pirates who had established themselves here.\r\nShips falling short of water occasionally visit this place for a supply.\r\n\r\nTo the north, and separated from it by a narrow channel, is the island\r\nof Ratos, (Rats,) three miles long, less stony, and more woody than the\r\nother, and where the degradados have formed plantations of the cotton\r\ntree. It is remarked that the animals from which this island derives\r\nits name did not exist here some few years ago. In the channel there is\r\na hollow stone, where the sea bursts forth with a loud noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. XX.\r\n\r\n                          PROVINCE OF SIARA.\r\n\r\n   _Colonization--Boundaries--Indians--Taken by the Dutch--\r\n   Restored--Mountains--Mineralogy--Zoology--Phytology--Rivers\r\n   and Lakes--Povoaçoes._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not recorded whether the territory of this province had any other\r\ndonatories besides the unfortunate Joam de Barros and Luis de Mello,\r\nnor is the precise epoch known of the foundation of the prezidios, or\r\ngarrisons, from which commenced the colonization that existed upon the\r\ncoast in 1603, when Captain Pedro Coelho de Souza, arrived there by\r\norders of the governor of the state, with eighty Portuguese and eight\r\nhundred Indians, in various caravels, for the purpose of destroying the\r\nalliance Mons. Bombille, a Frenchman, had formed with the celebrated\r\nMel Redondo, principal chief of the Serra Hibiapaba, from which\r\nconsiderable injury resulted to the prezidios. He received some people\r\nfrom them to enable him the better to execute the project, which he\r\naccomplished by subjecting this Indian to the Portuguese crown. On\r\nhis return, Pedro Coelho entered the river Jaguaribe, merely with the\r\nintention of making some observations; but discovering a great number\r\nof advantages which it presented, he determined to commence a city\r\nthere with his party: and having ordered his family to join him from\r\nParahiba, he continued occupied in the foundation of the colony with\r\nthe name of Nova Lisboa, (New Lisbon;) but shortly afterwards he was\r\nobliged by the Indians to desist from the undertaking, and returned to\r\nParahiba.\r\n\r\nDuarthe d’Albuquerque Coelho, writer of the war of Pernambuco, where he\r\nwas donatory, affirms from ocular testimony, that Martim Soares Moreno,\r\nwho belonged to the principal _prezidio_ of Siara, came in the\r\nyear 1631, to succour him against the Dutch, with an auxiliary force of\r\nIndians, in whose language he was well versed, and was named the first\r\ngovernor of that prezidio by the King: it being also certain that he\r\ncommanded it in 1613, when, leaving in his place Estevam de Campos, he\r\naccompanied Jeronymo d’Albuquerque in the first attempt against the\r\nFrench who were established in the island of Maranham; but it does\r\nnot appear whether he was the commandant or not at the period when\r\nCapt. Pedro Coelho arrived there. The district, however, was colonized\r\nvery slowly, in consequence of the deficiency of good ports, and those\r\nadvantages calculated to attract a numerous colony.\r\n\r\nThis province, which took the name of one of its small rivers,\r\nin consequence of the first establishment being founded near its\r\nembouchure, is confined on the north by the ocean, on the south by\r\nthe cordillera of Ararippe or Cayriris, which divides it from that of\r\nPernambuco, on the east by the provinces of Rio Grande and Parahiba,\r\nand on the west by that of Piauhy, from which it is separated by the\r\nHibiapaba serra. It is computed to be about three hundred miles at its\r\ngreatest length and width.\r\n\r\nThe whole was principally in the power of the numerous nation of\r\n_Potiguaras_, (although there were the _Guanacas_ and _Jaguaruannas_,)\r\ndivided into various hordes. The main part of them were Christianized\r\nby the exertions of the Jesuits, for which purpose they had an hospicio\r\nin Aquiraz, whose ruins are now called Collegio. The first catechists\r\nof this people were two Capuchin missionaries left here by Frey\r\nChristovam, from Lisbon, the first friar of Para, at the entreaties of\r\nMartim Soares Moreno.\r\n\r\nThe face of the country is almost generally uneven, without any deep\r\nvalleys, and with few mountains of considerable elevation, if we\r\nexcept the branches of the Great Cordillera, with which it is in great\r\npart surrounded. The territory principally consists of a sandy, arid,\r\nand sterile soil, partially wooded. Upon the serras alone are to be\r\ndiscovered extensive woods, the soil being substantial and fertile, and\r\nthere the best plantations of produce are formed, the remainder of the\r\ncountry serving as pasturage for large quantities of cattle bred there.\r\n\r\nThe winters are irregular, and commonly dry, some years passing without\r\nany rain, the consequences of which are many fatalities. This scourge\r\nupon the country is said to be repeated about every ten years, with\r\nsome exceptions. The heat is intense in the flat parts of the central\r\ndistricts. In 1792, a drought commenced, which lasted four years,\r\nduring which time all domestic animals perished, and many people. Honey\r\nwas for a long time the only aliment, which produced various epidemics,\r\nand swept off many thousand persons throughout the province. Seven\r\nparishes were completely deserted, without there remaining a single\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nIn 1632, two Dutch vessels of war arrived upon the coast with the\r\nintention of making an easy conquest of it, through the medium of an\r\nintrigue with the Indians; and, for the accomplishment of this project,\r\nfour Indians were ordered to penetrate into the interior, who, with\r\nmany others, had been taken in the bay of Trahicao, and sent to\r\nAmsterdam, where they learned the Batavian language. Two of them being\r\ndiscovered, through the activity of Domingos da Veyga, commandant of\r\nthe presidio, were immediately executed as an example to the others;\r\nand the Dutch, despairing, in consequence, of succeeding in their\r\nundertaking, set sail again for Pernambuco.\r\n\r\nFive years afterwards, the Indians of this country, hearing of the\r\ngreat successes of the Dutch, on the arrival of Count Nassau at\r\nPernambuco, deputed two messengers to offer submission and obedience\r\nto them in case they wished to make themselves masters of the\r\npresidio, the commandant of which had concluded his days, and the\r\nsoldiery were in a sufficiently diminutive state. Four vessels were\r\nimmediately despatched, with two hundred soldiers, and the Dutch,\r\nwithout difficulty, possessed themselves of this province in the year\r\n1637, which they retained without any considerable advantage for some\r\nyears, and, on giving it up, did not leave, as in some other places,\r\nany public works of utility. The Indians, who spontaneously united with\r\nthem, undoubtedly expected to have met with that in the new conquerors\r\nwhich they could not find in the first; but it does not appear that\r\nthey were quite so satisfied, as they retired to the southern lands\r\nin the vicinity of the cordillera. The missionaries of the Protestant\r\nreligion, it would appear, did not please them so well as the spells,\r\nrosaries, ceremonies, and parade, accompanied with music, all so\r\nimposing on the imagination, and with which the Jesuits allured them\r\nfrom the savage life.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--The serra of Jaguaribe, with many spiral heads, is to the\r\neast of the river of that name. The serra of Guammame, which commences\r\nnear the Jaguaribe, ranges for thirty miles to the west, at a distance\r\nof about eighteen from the coast; that of Siara, with four heads, is\r\nbetween the river of its name on the east, and the Cahohyppe on the\r\nwest. The serra of Mandahu is between the river of the same name on the\r\nwest, and the bay of Curu on the east; that of Caracu, having the river\r\nof that name on the west, and the Aracaty-mirim on the east.\r\n\r\nThe serra Borytamma is behind the morro of Jericoacoara, situated at\r\nthe bottom of the bay of this name. The whole serve for land-marks to\r\nthe navigators coasting along these shores.\r\n\r\nThere is also the serra Uruburetama, running north and south between\r\nthe rivers Curu and Acaracu; that of Botarite, in the centre of the\r\nprovince; and that of Merooca, seventy miles distant from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe serra of Hibiapaba, far from being a single cordon, is formed of\r\nvarious mountains, which succeed each other, and is in parts bare\r\nand stony; but the main portion is covered with forests of superb\r\ntimber, nourished by a soil of much substantiality and fecundity. The\r\n_Tabbajara_ Indians possess the greatest part of it.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Gold in small quantity; minerals of silver and iron,\r\nmore or less; crystals, chrysolites, pumice stone, amethysts, magnet,\r\ncalcareous stone, granite, saltpetre, white lead, potters’ earth, and\r\nstones of St. Anna, which are applied to females at child-birth.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--There are the ferret, hedge-hog, here called _quandu_, as at\r\nPernambuco, _praguica_, or sloth, ounce, deer, _coelho_, _guaxinin_,\r\n_quaty_, _pacca_, the wild boar, _capivara_, otter, and all other wild\r\nquadrupeds, peculiar to the neighbouring provinces. The _guariba_\r\nmonkeys assemble in large bands upon the thickest trees of the woods,\r\nand make a babbling noise like the loud grating of the Brazilian\r\nwaggon. Among other species of birds are common the emu ostrich,\r\n_seriema_, _jaburu_, _colhereira_, _tucano_, _mutun_, _jacu_, torquaze\r\npigeon, _guiraponga_, _nhambu_, _zabele_, parrot, _urubu_, _sabia_. In\r\nthe lakes there are a diversity of ducks, geese, _galeiro_, a diving\r\nbird; and near their margins, the _saracura_, _macarico_, and _socco_.\r\nBats are very numerous, particularly in years of great drought, and\r\nmore fatal to the cattle than the wild beasts collectively, actually\r\nreducing rich farmers to indigence, extensive plains covered with many\r\nthousand head of cattle becoming totally deserted. This animal, worse\r\nthan a pestilence, destroys most in the fazendas that have rocks, in\r\nwhose caverns they breed, where they cluster together during the day in\r\nlarge piles, and where also they are better killed, either with fire\r\nor with the gun. Goats and sheep are sufficiently numerous, though not\r\nso much so as they were previously to the fatal drought alluded to;\r\nthe latter resist the rainy seasons the best, and are more prolific,\r\ngenerally having two at a birth, many three, few one, and some four:\r\ngoats commonly have two also, many one, but rarely afford three at a\r\nbirth. In the vicinity of the river Jaguaribe, the most numerous flocks\r\nof both species are met with. Neither the flesh nor milk of those\r\nanimals are held in much repute, and, what is equally singular, the\r\npeople are imperfectly acquainted with the art of rendering their skins\r\na branch of commerce.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--There are a diversity of trees which afford excellent\r\ntimber for building, others for cabinet work, and dyes; also those\r\nwhich produce benzoin, gum copal and gum mastick; likewise various\r\nspecies of the palm, of which the _carnahuba_ is the most common and\r\nuseful tree in the country; of it houses are formed without any other\r\ningredient than clay, the trunk serving for the substantial part, and\r\nthe leaves in the shape of a fan for the covering; the latter are also\r\nused for mats, hand-baskets, hats, and little panniers. They afford,\r\nbesides, sustenance for cattle at the period of great droughts, for,\r\nwhilst new, the pith of the trunk is soft, and given to animals in\r\ndefault of other aliment: a sort of farinha, or flour, is also made\r\nfrom it, which is a resource in times of famine. In the centre of the\r\nfoliage there is a glutinous pod, which, when applied to the fire,\r\nacquires the consistency of wax, of which it has the smell. Its fruit,\r\nwhich is a bunch of a black colour, supplies sustenance to all living\r\ncreatures; and beautiful walking canes are made of its timber, which\r\nbecome speckled on being polished.\r\n\r\nThe _oiticica_ is the largest, and has the most abundant foliage of\r\nany tree of the certam. Its cool shade is grateful to man, as well as\r\nall animals of the country, but only grows where its roots can find\r\nwater. In the woods the _jabuticaba_ is common, and in the catingas the\r\n_ambuzo_.\r\n\r\nThe culture of cotton is in the progress of augmentation, and its\r\nproduce is the principal branch of commerce, and introduces into the\r\ncountry the greatest part of foreign commodities, which the necessities\r\nof life or luxury may require. The cane prospers in many districts, but\r\nits juice is almost all distilled into spirit, or reduced into what are\r\ntermed _rapaduras_, which are portions of muscovado sugar, in the\r\nform of a brick, which it receives after being put into wooden moulds.\r\nThe produce of coffee, which with industry might become prodigious, is\r\nyet insignificant. The same may be said of the cocoa shrub. Indian corn\r\nis the only grain which prospers in the country.\r\n\r\nThe _atta_, which is the pine of the southern provinces, is here\r\nabundant, and the best of all in the Brazil, and perhaps in America.\r\nMelons, and water-melons are excellent in many situations, also the\r\npine-apple. Orange trees are almost useless in some places, and\r\nthe banana, or plantain, is rare in consequence of the occasional\r\ndeficiency of rain. The _mangaba_ and _araca_ are common in all the\r\ndistricts, as well as the cajue-nut and the tobacco plant. Cattle,\r\nhides, cotton, and salt, are almost the only articles of exportation.\r\n\r\nFormerly a considerable quantity of amber was collected, which the high\r\ntides deposited upon the beach. The bees produce a great abundance of\r\nhoney in the cavities of trees. _Quinaquina_, or Jesuits’ bark, is\r\nrarely seen.\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND LAKES.--Of the great number of rivers in this\r\nprovince the only large one is the Jaguaribe, which, in the idiom\r\nof the Indians, means the “river of ounces.” It has its origin in\r\nthe serra of Boavista, which is a portion of the Cayriris, in the\r\ndistrict of Inhamu, and runs, like all the others, to the north,\r\npasses the towns of St. Joam do Principe, St. Bernardo, and Aricaty,\r\nand discharges itself into the ocean fifty miles west of the Appody.\r\nIts course through the cattle plains is handsome and interesting;\r\nthe tide runs thirty miles, and gives it a majestic appearance. It\r\nhas a diversity of fish, a considerable part of which enter with\r\nthe inundations into the adjacent lakes, where they are greatly\r\ndiminished by the _jaburu_ and other ichthyophagous birds. Its\r\nprincipal tributaries are the river Salgado, which flows from the same\r\ncordillera, breaks through a mountain which it encounters, passes\r\nby the parishes of Lavras and Icco, and enters its superior by the\r\nright margin, having traversed the district of Mangabeira, where\r\nthere is gold, the extraction of which was forbidden. The Banabuyhu,\r\nlittle inferior to the preceding, comes from the vicinity of the\r\nbefore-mentioned cordillera, joining its waters to the Jaguaribe a\r\nfew leagues below the last confluence, having received, amongst other\r\nsmaller streams, the Quixeramuby.\r\n\r\nThe river Caracu has its heads in the centre of the province, waters\r\nthe town of Sobral, and is discharged by two mouths near forty miles\r\nto the east of the bay of Jericoacoara. The tide runs up some leagues,\r\nrendering it navigable for a considerable space.\r\n\r\nThe river Camucim, which in the interior of the country flows under the\r\nname of Croaihu, and which has one hundred miles of course, originates\r\nin the serra of Hibiapaba, refreshes the town of Granja, and empties\r\nitself twenty-five miles to the east of the last-mentioned bay. It\r\nis navigable for a considerable distance, and has at its embouchure\r\na commodious anchorage for sumacas, which export from thence a large\r\nquantity of cotton, principally to Maranham.\r\n\r\nThe river Aricaty is extensive, and enters the sea by two unequal\r\nmouths, denominated Aricaty-Assu and Aricaty-Mirim; the first is the\r\neastern. The intervening island is four miles in diameter and about\r\ntwenty-five east of the Caracu.\r\n\r\nThe Cahohyppe, which flows into the ocean, fifteen miles to the west\r\nof the capital; the Cioppe, eighteen miles more to the west; the Curu,\r\nwhich discharges itself twenty miles further in the same direction;\r\nand the Mandahu, nearly fifty miles more, and eighteen to the east of\r\nAricaty-Assu, are the only others worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nIn all the rivers of this province there is a species of fish\r\nresembling a skate, with a spur upon the tail, the painful sting of\r\nwhich, when it does not produce death, leaves the patient with a\r\nterrible wound: the only remedy known is burning with a hot iron or\r\ncaustic, when the artery is not affected. The Author of Nature has\r\nbeneficently ordained that they confine themselves to the bottom of\r\ndead water, and do no harm to those who bathe in running streams.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Velho is to the right of the Jaguaribe, with which it\r\ncommunicates by two channels in the parish of St. Joam, many leagues\r\ndistant from the town of Aricaty. The lake of Jaguaracu lies between\r\nthe rivers Cioppe and Siara, thirty-five miles from the sea, and the\r\nlake Camurupim, a short way from the eastern margin of the river\r\nCamucim, are the most considerable. Other periodical lakes are to be\r\nremarked, of little depth and considerable diameter, which only exist\r\nwhilst it rains, and whose waters, on the return of heat and dry winds,\r\ncrystallize into a white and excellent salt.\r\n\r\nISLANDS, CAPES, AND PORTS.--On the extensive coast of this\r\nprovince there are no promontories or remarkable capes, no ports for\r\nthe reception of large vessels, nor islands, except in the embouchures\r\nor beds of the rivers. The shore in some parts is steep, in others flat\r\nand sandy, covered with mangroves, and having in some situations fine\r\ncocoa-nut trees.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Titoya, with seven miles of mouth and two of depth, is\r\nsurrounded by handsome mangroves, full of divers species of crab-fish,\r\nand is situated between the mouth of the Camucim and the limit of the\r\nprovince. The bay of Jericoacoara, considerable, and pointed out by\r\nthe morro of the same name, and the bay of Iguape, surrounded by high\r\nbarriers, contracted into a point by a mount on the eastern side, are\r\nthe only openings in the land meriting that denomination.\r\n\r\nA line drawn north and south, from the river Curu to the southern\r\nlimit, divides this province into two parts almost equal.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part are the following towns:--\r\n\r\n    Nossa Senhora d’Assumpçao\r\n    Aricaty\r\n    Icco\r\n    Cratto\r\n    Bom Jardim\r\n    St. Bernardo\r\n    St. Joam do Principe\r\n    Campo Maior\r\n    Aquiraz\r\n    Montemor o Novo\r\n    Mecejanna\r\n    Soure\r\n    Arronches.\r\n\r\nIn the western division:--\r\n\r\n    Sobral\r\n    Villa Viçosa\r\n    Villa Nova d’el Rey.\r\n\r\nNossa Senhora d’Assumpçao, otherwise Villa do Forte, so named in\r\nconsequence of a fort which defended it, but more commonly called\r\nSiara, is a very middling town, and the residence of the governor;\r\nthe chapel, dedicated to the Assumption of Our Lady, was the origin\r\nof its present name. It is the capital of the province, and has a\r\nchurch of St. Joze de Ribamar. It is situated near the beach, is\r\nsurrounded with a sandy soil, and about seven miles to the north-west\r\nof the embouchure of the river Siara, where it was first commenced\r\nat the place now called Villavelha. It is the most ancient town in\r\nthe province, and the reputed city of Siara of Vosgien, possessing\r\nhowever no advantages that would warrant the expectation of any great\r\nimprovement of its present condition. The pine, or atta, is here very\r\nlarge, and its fruit delicious. In 1808 it received a Juiz de Fora,\r\nwho is judge of all civil and criminal causes, also auditor of war,\r\njudge of the custom-house, attorney-general, and deputy of the junta\r\nof the treasury, which does not differ in its jurisdiction from any of\r\nthe others. The governor of this province touched at Pernambuco during\r\nmy stay there; the term of his government had expired, and he was on\r\nhis way to Rio de Janeiro. This province cannot boast of any foreign\r\ncommerce; the principal part of its produce has hitherto been sent\r\nby coasting vessels principally to Maranham; and in like manner its\r\ninternal demands have been supplied. A respectable house of London have\r\nit in contemplation to form an establishment here: this house has had\r\nfor many years establishments at Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and Pernambuco.\r\n\r\nTo the west of this town is the parish of Conceiçao d’Almofalla,\r\nwhose parishioners are whites, with some Tramembe Indians; the whole\r\ncultivating mandioca, legumes, and rice. In its district there are\r\nsalt-pits.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the preceding is the parish of Conceiçao d’Amontada,\r\nthe population of which, for the main part whites, cultivate the same\r\nproductions, and breed cattle.\r\n\r\nAricaty, the largest, most populous, commercial, and flourishing town\r\nand frequented port of the province, was created by John V. in 1723,\r\nand is situated on the eastern margin, eight miles above the mouth of\r\nthe Jaguaribe, the large floods of which river incommode a portion of\r\nits inhabitants. It has a church dedicated to the Lady of Rozario,\r\nand four hermitages, with the titles of Lord Jesus of Bom Fim, of\r\nNavigators, of the Lady of Livramento, and of St. Gonçalo; a professor\r\nof Latin; good streets; and many houses of one story, with a great\r\nportion of them built of brick. Cotton and hides are its principal\r\nexportations.\r\n\r\nIcco stands along the right margin of the river Salgado, a few leagues\r\nabove its mouth, one hundred miles north of Cratto, and near one\r\nhundred and eighty south of Aricaty, is a considerable town, with a\r\nchurch dedicated to the Lady of Expectaçao, a hermitage of Rozario,\r\nanother of the Lord Bom Fim, and a royal master of Latin. Its edifices\r\nare chiefly of wood, and its inhabitants are much incommoded by the\r\nheat, reflected from a morro, or rock, near it, and from whence a vast\r\nextent of the environs are viewed, abounding with cattle. The river\r\nis well stored with fish, and is subject to floods, which inundate\r\na considerable space of territory, that produces rice, Indian corn,\r\nfeijao, water-melons, and excellent melons; but neither the plantain,\r\nnor any fruit trees prosper in its vicinity. Farinha and sugar are\r\nbrought here from Cratto, and salt from Assu.\r\n\r\nLavras da Mangabeira, a parish created in 1813, is thirty-five\r\nmiles above Icco, of which it is a dismembered portion, and is upon\r\nthe margin of the Salgado. Its church is dedicated to St. Vincente\r\nFerreyra, and its inhabitants raise various necessaries of life,\r\ncotton, and cattle.\r\n\r\nCratto, a town in a state of mediocrity, situated in a plain near\r\na small stream, that takes its name, being one of the heads of the\r\nSalgado, has a church of the Lady of Penha, and is the most abundant\r\ntown of the province. Every fruit tree of the South American continent\r\nprospers in its fertile district, and it has the advantage of running\r\nstreams to irrigate the plantations, not excepting those of mandioca,\r\nwhen the rains fail, and to which may be attributed the superabundance\r\nof the necessaries of life it always enjoys. The neighbouring districts\r\nhave recourse to them when they experience years of drought, and the\r\nconsequent deficiency of vegetation. Limes, citrons, bananas, and\r\ncabbages, are of an uncommon size. Diseases of the eyes and legs are\r\nhere endemical. Thunder showers commence in its vast district, which\r\nis a portion of the Cayriris Novas, in October, and last till May. In\r\ncertain months cold nights are experienced.\r\n\r\nThirty miles to the east-south-east is the parish of St. Joze, yet\r\nknown by the name of Missao Velha, (Old Mission.) Its numerous\r\nparishioners, generally whites, cultivate mandioca, Indian corn, and\r\nthe sugar cane.\r\n\r\nBom Jardim was created a town by a law of the 30th of August, 1814, and\r\nis a dismemberment of Missao Velha, made two years previously, which\r\nwas then the most populous parish of the province. It is fifty miles\r\ndistant from Cratto, and has a church of Bom Jesus. Sugar and cattle\r\nform the riches of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Bernardo, yet small, is situated near a small river,\r\nwhich two miles lower joins the Jaguaribe on the western margin,\r\nthirty-five miles above Aricaty, and one hundred and forty miles below\r\nIcco. Its church is dedicated to the Lady of Rozario, and cattle and\r\ncotton constitute the means of subsistence for the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSt. Joam do Principe, originally Thauha, is a small town near the\r\nJaguaribe, a few leagues below its source, in a fine and fertile\r\ndistrict, enjoying salubrious air. The inhabitants are breeders of\r\ncattle, and produce cotton and the necessaries of life. In its environs\r\nthere is an abundant mine of pumice stone.\r\n\r\nSobral, formerly Caracu, situated in a plain upon the margin of the\r\nriver from which it derived its primitive name, is the second town in\r\nthe province in point of size, commerce, and population. It is seventy\r\nmiles distant from the sea, and ten from the serra of Merooca. Besides\r\na parish church, dedicated to the Lady of Conceiçao, it has a chapel\r\nof Rozario; and within its district the chapels of St. Joze, St. Cruz,\r\nSt. Anna, St. Quiteria, Rozario, upon the small stream of Guimareas,\r\nand Conceiçao, upon the serra of Merooca, where cultivation partially\r\nappears.\r\n\r\nGranja stands in a plain upon the left bank of the Camucim, twenty\r\nmiles from the sea. It is a middling and flourishing town, promising\r\nfrom its advantageous situation future augmentation. St. Joze is the\r\nnominal patron of its church. In its district there are the hermitages\r\nof St. Antonio do Olho d’Agua, St. Antonio d’Hyboassu, and Livramento.\r\nFrom its port, which is frequented, cotton and hides are exported.\r\n\r\nVilla Viçosa is a large town, and well situated upon the serra of\r\nHibiapaba, on land selected by the Jesuits for the establishment of\r\na colony of Indians, the descendants of whom constitute at this time\r\nthe principal portion of its numerous population. It is near a lake,\r\nand forty miles to the south-south-west of Granja; the houses are of\r\nwood or bricks. The church, dedicated to the Lady of Assumpçao, is the\r\nci-devant Jesuitical hospicio, and the residence at present of the\r\nvicars, who are administrators of a fazenda for breeding cattle, in the\r\nsituation of Thyaya, established as a patrimony for the said church.\r\nThe nights of summer are cooler here than those of winter. Amongst\r\nother springs of good water is to be remarked that which is denominated\r\nAgua do Inferno, (Infernal Water,) in consequence of being in a craggy\r\nand rugged place, the water of which is particularly excellent. The\r\ngreat fertility within its vast circumference, covered with handsome\r\nwoods, where plantations of cotton and the various necessaries of\r\nlife prosper, united with the salubrity of the air which refreshes\r\nit, attracts here numerous Europeans, who give a stimulus to its\r\nagriculture. The Indians of the town, with those who are distributed\r\nthrough its district, form eighteen companies of militia.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of about thirty miles is the parish of St. Pedro de\r\nBayapinna, upon the same serra. Its inhabitants are whites and Indians,\r\nwhose productions are the same as the preceding.\r\n\r\nVilla Nova d’el Rey, (New Town of the King,) formerly Campo Grande, is\r\nsituated upon the serra Cocos, which is a portion of the Hibiapaba,\r\nand near the origin of the small river Macambyra, and was founded for\r\nthe habitation of a horde of Christianized Indians, of which there are\r\nfew remaining. In consequence of the fertility of the country, the\r\nexcellence of the waters, and the salubrity of the air, many whites are\r\nattracted here. It is seventy miles to the south-east of Villa Viçosa,\r\nhas a church of the Lady of Prazeres, with environs rich in plantations\r\nof mandioca, the cane, and cotton. About twenty-five miles from it is\r\nthe church of St. Gonçalo, whose parishioners live dispersed upon the\r\nsame serra, and cultivate the same productions.\r\n\r\nCampo Maior de Quixeramoby is a considerable and abundant town, with\r\na handsome church of St. Antonio, and situated one hundred and thirty\r\nmiles to the south of Aricaty, on the margin of the river which affords\r\nits name, with large numbers of cattle in its vicinity, constituting\r\nthe principal property of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAquiraz, which is about four miles distant from the sea, and eighteen\r\nfrom the capital to the south-east, upon the eastern margin of the\r\nPacoty, and a mile from the lake which affords it the name, is a\r\nmiddling town with some commerce, and a church dedicated to St. Joze.\r\n\r\nMontemor o Novo is situated upon the serra of Botarite, having a church\r\nof the Lady of Palma, and is about one hundred and thirty miles to the\r\nsouth of the capital. The inhabitants respire a salubrious air, have\r\nthe advantage of good water, and form plantations of the mandioca and\r\nthe cane. A few leagues north of the preceding is the parish of the\r\nLady of Conceiçao of Montemor o Velho, the inhabitants of which are\r\nwhites and Indians, which latter are diminishing, as in other places,\r\nwith the augmentation of the first.\r\n\r\nMecejanna is ten miles to the south-east of the capital, near a lake,\r\nhaving a church of the Lady of Conceiçao.\r\n\r\nSoure, situated near the eastern margin of the river Siara, fifteen\r\nmiles from the sea, and the same distance from the capital, has a\r\nchurch dedicated to May de Deos.\r\n\r\nArronches, which has for titular patroness the Lady of Humildes, is\r\ndistant seven miles from the capital, towards the south.\r\n\r\nThe three last are Indian towns, with some whites and mesticos, who\r\ncultivate mandioca, cotton, rice, legumes, &c. The whole were founded\r\nin places selected for the establishments of Christianized Indians.\r\nThey are all small but capable of becoming considerable, if their\r\ninhabitants were possessed of more activity and intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the sources of the river Jaguaribe, are the parishes\r\nof St. Mattheus, in the district of Inhamuz; of the Lady of Paz, in the\r\ndistrict of Arneyros, formerly a Christianized Indian town. Cattle and\r\nthe necessaries of life are their principal productions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\n                          PROVINCE OF PIAUHY.\r\n\r\n   _Boundaries--First Settlers--Cattle Fazendas--Mountains--\r\n   Mineralogy--Rivers--Towns._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis province derives its name from one of the rivers which water it,\r\nand was created in the year 1718, being till that period a comarca\r\nof Maranham, but did not begin to have governors before 1758. It is\r\ncomputed to comprise four hundred miles from north to south, and one\r\nhundred and seventy of medium width. Its form is almost triangular,\r\nhaving more than three hundred and forty miles on the southern side,\r\nwhere it is confined by the province of Pernambuco, and about sixty\r\non the northern side, where it is washed by the ocean. On the east\r\nit is bounded by the province of Siara, from which it is separated\r\nby the serra of Hibiapaba, on the west by the river Parnahiba, which\r\ndivides it from Maranham. The country is almost generally low and\r\nflat, interspersed with small hills and extensive plains, principally\r\nsandy, in great part destitute of trees, and also in places of shrubs.\r\nIt exhibits herbage during the period of rains, or whilst the soil\r\npreserves any humidity, but it is soon shrivelled up on the return\r\nof the sun’s parching rays. This province has various streams all\r\ntributary to the important river Parnahiba. The winter commences in\r\nOctober, and lasts till April, accompanied with thunder and rain. The\r\nwind prevails at the beginning from the north, and afterwards passes\r\nround to the south. The climate is hot, and fevers reign in some\r\ndistricts. In the northern part, the days and nights are equal all the\r\nyear, and in the southern districts of the province there is only a\r\ndifference of half an hour. This territory was possessed by various\r\nnations, generally not numerous, whose reduction or repulsion did not\r\nconsume much time or expenditure of lives, differing in this respect\r\nfrom many other provinces of much less extent, and arising from the\r\nconcurring circumstances of the great deficiency of woods and serras,\r\nwhich in almost all the other districts served the savages for retreat\r\nand refuge. Those who afforded the greatest difficulty in subduing\r\nthem, were a tribe living in the vicinity of the river Poty, commanded\r\nby a domestic Indian, who had fled from an aldeia of Pernambuco, and\r\nwho animated them to a desperate resistance, until he perished in\r\nswimming across the Parnahiba. Mandu Ladino was the common name by\r\nwhich this chieftain was designated.\r\n\r\nMore than fifty years had elapsed without any intelligence of the\r\nexistence of wild Indians within the precincts of the province, when,\r\nabout the year 1760, on its southern side, a band appeared, who from\r\nthat period have annoyed the colonists very much, and have compelled\r\nthem to abandon a great number of fazendas for breeding cattle. The\r\nwhites give this tribe the appellation of _Pimenteiras_, in\r\nconsequence of there being a situation so denominated in the district\r\nwhich they occupy. They have their dwelling places between the heads\r\nof the rivers Piauhy and Gurguea, near the boundary of the province,\r\nbeing surrounded by the establishments of the Portuguese. Within their\r\nterritory there is a large lake abounding with fish, near which they\r\ntake up their residence for a considerable period of the year. It is\r\nconjectured that they were, or at least in part, descendants of various\r\nfamilies who lived domesticated with the whites in the vicinity of\r\nQuebrobo, and from whom they deserted about the year 1685, in order\r\nto avoid marching under the banners of the forces equipped against\r\ntheir Indian brethren. Their hostilities commenced in consequence\r\nof a dog being killed in the vicinity of Gurguea, whither they had\r\nproceeded upon an occasion of hunting. In a frustrated assault which\r\nthey made, eighty bows were found, from which it was inferred they had\r\na considerably greater number of men capable of using that weapon.\r\nDomingos Jorge, a Paulista, and Domingos Affonso, from Maffra, in\r\nPortugal, were the first persons who began the conquest of this\r\nprovince. Towards the year 1674, the latter possessed a fazenda for\r\nbreeding cattle on the northern side of the river St. Francisco. The\r\ngreat injury which he there sustained from the central Indians, and the\r\ndesire of augmenting his fortune with similar possessions, urged him\r\nto undertake the conquest of the northern country, for which object\r\nhe assembled all the people he could accumulate, and having passed\r\nthe serra of Dois Irmaos, (Two Brothers,) towards the north, he,\r\nfortunately for himself, encountered the Paulista before mentioned, who\r\nwas in the progress of reducing Indians to captivity, and they afforded\r\nmutual succour to each other. Having ultimately captured a considerable\r\nnumber, and caused the remainder to retire, the Paulista returned to\r\nhis country with the greater part of the captive Indians, and the\r\nEuropean remained master of the territory. Other companies made similar\r\nentries into this district, the said Affonso always remaining supreme\r\ncaptain of the whole, and the vast possessions thus acquired by the\r\nentrance of various parties, received the denomination of Certam. It is\r\nsaid that he established above fifty fazendas for the breeding of large\r\ncattle, and that he gave away and sold many during his life. It is\r\nhowever certain, that at his death, he left thirty, and appointed the\r\nJesuits of the College of Bahia administrators of them, ordering the\r\nrevenues of eleven to be appropriated for dowries to young virgins, to\r\nthe clothing of widows, and to succour other necessities of the poor.\r\nWith the rest they were to augment the number of fazendas, but it is\r\nsaid that they only established three more. With the extinction of this\r\nsect, the whole passed under the administration of the crown, and are\r\npreserved in the same state by the inspection of three administrators,\r\neach having eleven fazendas in his jurisdiction, with three hundred\r\nmilreas of salary. They occupy the territory through which the rivers\r\nPiauhy and Caninde flow, from the boundary of the province to the north\r\nof the capital, in the vicinity of which there are some principal ones.\r\nThe privilege of forming establishments within their lands is not\r\ngranted to any one, where the slaves of the fazendas work alone for\r\ntheir subsistence and clothing. The cattle arriving at a certain age\r\nare conducted by the purchasers principally to Bahia and its reconcave.\r\nThose of the northern district descend to Maranham, others are driven\r\nto Pernambuco.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS.--This province has no serras of any consequence,\r\nif we except the cordillera which limits it on the east, and that from\r\nwhence emanate the divers branches of the Parnahiba. In the interior\r\nalone there are trifling hills, and some small morros, which even in\r\nthe country have not acquired any names.\r\n\r\nThe serra denominated Dois Irmaos consists of two small mounts in the\r\nsouthern confines, between which the road passes from the capital to\r\nthe river St. Francisco.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Gold, iron, lead, copperas, pumice stone, saltpetre,\r\nmineral salt, magnete, talc, grindstone, red lead, parget, potters’\r\nearth, and abundance of calcareous stone.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--The river Parnahiba is formed of three currents of the same\r\nname, the origins of which are in the skirts or proximity of the serra\r\nwhich limits the province on the south-west. Its first tributary is\r\nthe river Balsas, the only one which joins it by the left margin. A\r\nshort distance below this confluence, the river Urussuhy enters it\r\non the right, and comes from the same serra. Eighty miles lower, the\r\nGurguea is incorporated with it; one hundred miles further it receives\r\nthe Caninde, and twenty more, the Poty. After one hundred and thirty\r\nmiles, the mouth of the river Longa is met with, a little lower\r\nthan which a small arm issues from the Parnahiba to the east, which\r\ntraverses a large lake called Encantada, and forms an island of about\r\nfive miles in length, of proportionate width, flat, and in the form of\r\nhalf a circle. Twenty miles further, this river divides itself into two\r\nrather unequal currents, and ultimately enters the ocean by six mouths,\r\nformed by five islands of various sizes, which are never submerged,\r\nand some of them afford pasture for cattle. The eastern branch and the\r\nmost considerable is denominated Hyguarassu, the next Barravelha, that\r\nwhich follows is called Barra do Meio; the fourth, Barra do Caju; the\r\nfifth, Barra das Cannarias, the most western Tutoya, by which the small\r\nriver of the same name is discharged. Thirty miles is reckoned between\r\nthe two extreme embouchures. This river, by which barks of considerable\r\nburden proceed up to the confluence of the Balsas, affords navigation\r\nvery nearly to its origin to canoes, which use the sail for eight days,\r\nthe remainder always the oar and the vara, rendering the voyage long\r\nand tedious. This river has no falls, only currents, the largest of\r\nwhich render it necessary to relieve the barks of half their cargoes.\r\nIts bed is winding, and generally wide and handsome. Amongst many other\r\nfish which it affords the most esteemed are the _sorubin_, _camurupin_,\r\n_piratinga_, _fidalgo_, _mandin_, _pirapemba_, _piranha_, and _trahira_.\r\n\r\nThe river Poty, to which was given the name of the people who inhabited\r\nthe country through which it flows at its commencement, originates\r\non the western side of the mountain from whence the Jaguaribe before\r\ndescribed issues, in the district of St. Joze. After a course of about\r\nfifty miles, traversing plains which abound with cattle, and fifteen\r\nmiles below the arraial of the Piranhas, where there is a hermitage of\r\nthe Lord Bom Jesus, it opens a narrow passage across the cordillera,\r\nforming various interesting cascades. Issuing from thence, it receives\r\nby the right margin the considerable stream Macambira, that flows from\r\nthe Serra Cocos. Thirty-five miles below this confluence, it is united\r\non the left by the small river Marvao; and about the same distance\r\nfurther, it receives by the same side the river St. Victor, which comes\r\nfrom the plains of Lagoa, with more than seventy miles of course, and\r\nbrings with it the small rivers St. Nicolau and Berlengas. Upwards of\r\nseventy miles below this point, it discharges itself into the ocean.\r\nIts bed is for the most part wide, and its current tranquil. Canoes\r\nadvance up some leagues; and upon its margins is cultivated good\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nThe river Gurguea issues from a stony part of the skirts of the serra\r\nof its name, which is a portion of that before mentioned, where the\r\nriver Urussuhy has its origin. After flowing seventy miles north, it\r\ngathers on the right the Pirahim, and, continuing in the same direction\r\nfor one hundred and seventy miles more, it falls into the Parnahiba.\r\nIts current is rapid, and almost universally through a flat country,\r\nabounding with cattle. It affords navigation only during the winter,\r\nhas one fall a few leagues above its mouth, and its waters are of a\r\ngreenish colour.\r\n\r\nThe river Pirahim originates nine leagues to the east of the preceding,\r\nat the base of the same serra, which forms the boundary on the side of\r\nPernambuco, and, after seventy miles of course northward, it traverses\r\nthe lake Pernagua, and fifty miles lower enters the Parnahiba. It runs\r\nalmost generally between narrow banks, and with considerable depth\r\nthrough a solid soil.\r\n\r\nThe Caninde has its source near Serra Dois Irmaos, runs northward, and\r\npasses within two miles of Oeyras; and seventy miles further its waters\r\nare absorbed by the Parnahiba, after a course of one hundred and eighty\r\nmiles, through a flat country rich in cattle; it runs at first only as\r\na current during the period of rains. In the angle of its confluence\r\nthere is an extensive plain, well adapted for the foundation of a town,\r\nand within its precincts every branch of agriculture would not fail to\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nThe Itahim rises near the southern boundary of the province, passes\r\nnear the serra Vermelha, flowing for a considerable space parallel with\r\nthe Caninde, which it joins on the right eighteen miles above Oeyras,\r\nafter having traversed an extensive country abounding with cattle. Its\r\nlargest confluent is the small river Guaribis, which has a considerable\r\ncourse, and joins it, by the right margin, eight miles above its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Piauhy, from which the province derives its name, originates near\r\nthe boundary, runs north, and enters the Caninde fifty miles below the\r\ncapital, after a course of one hundred and forty miles, through lands\r\naffording pasturage for cattle.\r\n\r\nThe river Longa rises in the campos of the town of Campo Maior, passing\r\nit within eight miles, and taking a northerly direction. Among other\r\nsmall rivers which enlarge it, are the Sorubim, the Maratahoan, running\r\nthrough a bed of amolar stone, and the Piracruca, which comes from the\r\nSerra Hibiapaba. It is only considerable during rains, and navigable\r\nfor the space of twenty miles to the situation of Victoria. Near its\r\nmargins, which abound with cattle and capibaras, there are many lakes:\r\nsome are considerable, and have small islands, but the whole are dried\r\nup immediately the river begins to be impoverished by drought.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--This province has few woods, and those of little extent;\r\nbut possesses trees of good timber for building. The _carnahuba_ and\r\n_piassaba_ trees are very numerous in some districts. Cocoa-nut trees\r\nappear only in the vicinity of the sea. _Quinaquina_, or Jesuits’\r\nbark, is said to grow here. The soil is in parts substantial, and\r\nappropriated to the culture of mandioca, Indian corn, legumes, rice,\r\nthe cane, and tobacco, producing sufficient of all for the consumption\r\nof the country. The tobacco upon the margins of the Parnahiba passes\r\nin the opinion of many for the best in the Brazil; at least it is\r\ndearer, and preferred to the approved quality of Bahia. There are\r\nlarge plantations of the cotton tree, the produce of which furnishes\r\na considerable branch of commerce. Jalap and ipecacuanha are not\r\nunknown; as also, among other fruit trees of the plains, the _ambuzo_,\r\nthe _jabuticaba_, and the _mangaba_; the _jaca_ and mango trees are\r\nrare. The orange and banana trees are not common to all places; but the\r\natta, or pine tree, prospers almost in all parts, and produces fruit in\r\nperfection. European fruit trees scarcely appear. The fig and the vine\r\nacquire little size and fructify in small quantity.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--The abundance and good quality of pasturage which is\r\nmet with in all the districts, and generally without many portions\r\nappropriated to agriculture, has caused the lands, almost in all parts,\r\nto be destined for breeding cattle, which are prodigiously numerous,\r\nand constitute the main property in the country; and this province\r\nmay be considered the great mart for the supply of beef to Maranham,\r\nPernambuco, and Bahia, at which places the cattle arrive in much better\r\ncondition than at Rio de Janeiro. Horses are not bred beyond the wants\r\nof the country. Sheep are numerous, and goats much less so; but if the\r\ninhabitants were industrious, and well acquainted with cutting and\r\ntanning the skins, they would form a considerable branch of commerce.\r\nAll the wild animals of the neighbouring provinces are well known here;\r\ndeer are the most numerous. In the short extent of the coast of this\r\nprovince there are no islands, capes, nor points; and the only port\r\nis that of the river Hyguarassu, capable of receiving sumacas, which\r\nformerly navigated to the town of St. Joao, but at present remain eight\r\nmiles below it, in consequence of the river diminishing in depth. The\r\nentrance, besides, is dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this province are the following:--\r\n\r\n    Oeyras\r\n    Parnahiba\r\n    Marvao\r\n    Campo Maior\r\n    Vallenca\r\n    Jerumenha\r\n    Pernagua.\r\n\r\nOeyras, to which King Joseph gave the title of city, with this\r\nappellation, in honour of his celebrated secretary, the first count of\r\nthat name, was denominated until then the town of Mocha, having been so\r\ncreated in the reign of John V. about the year 1718; and, although it\r\nhas been from this period the capital of the province, it does not yet\r\nsurpass a small town; but is well enough supplied, and well situated\r\nnear the right margin of a stream, which, three miles lower, falls into\r\nthe Caninde. It is two hundred and fifty miles to the south of St. Joam\r\nde Parnahiba, and upwards of three hundred to the south-south-east of\r\nSt. Luiz of Maranham; one hundred and forty in the same direction from\r\nCachias; and between six and seven hundred miles to the west of the\r\ntown of Pernambuco. The church is dedicated to the Lady of Victory, and\r\nit has also the hermitages of Conceiçao and Rozario. The houses are\r\ngenerally of clay and timber, whitened with potters’ earth; and the\r\ngreater part of its inhabitants are Europeans.\r\n\r\nParnahiba, a middling town, and the principal in the province, is\r\nadvantageously situated upon a point on the right margin of the eastern\r\nbranch of the river from which its name is borrowed, in sandy ground,\r\nfifteen miles from the sea. It has some houses of one story, which\r\nare not seen in any other towns of the province; and the streets are\r\ngenerally unpaved. It is the deposit of a great quantity of cotton and\r\nhides, and has a church dedicated to the Lady of Graca. The inhabitants\r\ndraw their water from the river or from cacimbas, and are frequently\r\nattacked with fevers. In 1811, it became the residence of a Juiz de\r\nFora, and a custom-house was at the same time established. Within its\r\ndistrict large and excellent melons grow, also water-melons throughout\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nCampo Maior is a town in a state of mediocrity, well situated upon\r\nthe margin, and eight miles above the embouchure of the small river\r\nSorubim, of which it formerly had the name. It is thirty miles distant\r\nfrom Parnahiba, near a profound lake, stored with fish and good water.\r\nBesides the church dedicated to St. Antonio, it has a hermitage of the\r\nLady of Rozario. The small river Maratahoan washes its district, from\r\nthe bed of which are drawn excellent grindstones. The inhabitants breed\r\ncattle, and cultivate cotton and the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nVallenca, primitively Catinguinha, is a small town, situated upon an\r\ninsignificant stream, which fifteen miles lower enters the river St.\r\nVictor. Its church is dedicated to the Lady of O. Within its district\r\nthere is saltpetre, and good pasturage, where many cattle are bred.\r\nTwenty-five miles distant is the chapel of the Lady of Conceiçao, and\r\nin its environs are cultivated the necessaries of life peculiar to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMarvao, whose first name was Rancho do Prato, is also a small place,\r\nsituated in a plain twenty miles above the mouth of the small river\r\nso called, on the margin of which graze herds of large cattle,\r\nconstituting the wealth of its dwellers. The Lady of Desterro is the\r\npatroness of its church, and within the district there is silver and\r\npumice-stone.\r\n\r\nJerumenha is an insignificant town, upon the margin and fifteen miles\r\nabove the embouchure of the Gurguea, of which it had originally the\r\nname. It has a church dedicated to St. Antonio; and the inhabitants\r\nbreed cattle and cultivate the common necessaries of life. They are\r\nfrequently attacked with fevers.\r\n\r\nPernagua is a small town and well situated upon the western margin of\r\na lake fifteen miles in length, near eight in width, deep, well stored\r\nwith fish, and traversed by the river Pirahim. It has a fine church of\r\nstone, dedicated to the Lady of Livramento; having flat environs, small\r\nhills only being seen at a distance. The inhabitants, amongst whom are\r\nsome Europeans, raise cattle and horses; and besides other agricultural\r\nproductions, the sugar cane, of which is made rapaduras, and an ardent\r\nspirit. It is above fifty miles distant from the southern limits of the\r\nprovince, about the same from the river Preto, and above one hundred\r\nand thirty miles from the town of St. Francisco das Chagas. In its\r\ndistrict there are portions of ground appropriated to the culture of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Pernagua which is reduced to eight miles of length, and\r\nfour in width, during the dry season, was formed, it is said, by an\r\nextraordinary overflowing of the river, since the Portuguese were\r\nmasters of the country.\r\n\r\nThe considerable arraial of Piracruca, well situated near the small\r\nriver of its name, forty miles distant from the mouth of the Longa, has\r\nthe best church of the province. In its district there are copperas\r\nand the real Jesuits’ bark. The inhabitants have large plantations of\r\ncotton, mandioca, and sugar; from the latter rum and rapaduras are made.\r\n\r\nThe aldeia and Indian parish of St. Gonçalo d’Amarante, is in a well\r\nselected and fertile district, where any other class of people would\r\nere this have rendered agriculture flourishing, lived in abundance,\r\nand have become rich. It is eighteen miles from the mouth of the\r\nCaninde, and seventy north of the capital; and was founded about the\r\nyear 1766, for the habitation of nine hundred _Guegues_, who\r\noccupied the country about the heads of the Parnahiba, and sixteen\r\nhundred _Acroas_, who lived more to the southward. Some time\r\nhaving elapsed, the whole deserted: they were, however, subsequently\r\nre-conquered, and re-established in the same place, which has ever\r\nsince been going into a state of decay.\r\n\r\nThe parish of the Lady of Merces, whose first inhabitants were mainly\r\nJahico Indians, lies between the Itahim, and the small river Guaribas.\r\nAll the parishioners live dispersed, the vicar being the only resident\r\nnear the church, which is about seventy miles from the capital.\r\n\r\nThe two last parishes were created a few years ago, and formerly\r\nbelonged to that of the capital; in whose extensive district there are\r\nyet to be remarked the chapel of Our Lady of Humildes, not far removed\r\nfrom the heads of the Caninde; that of St. Ignacio, near the same\r\nriver, and thirty-five miles from the capital; that of St. Joam, near\r\nthe origin of the Piauhy; and the Lady of Nazareth, upon the margin of\r\nthe said river, forty miles from Oeyras; also the Lady of Conceiçao, in\r\nthe situation of Bocayna, near the small river Guaribas.\r\n\r\nThe considerable arraial of Poti, advantageously situated near the\r\nembouchure of the river which affords it the name, has already some\r\ncommerce, and might easily become a considerable povoaçao. All the\r\npeople are within the diocese of the bishop of Maranham, who has a\r\nvicar-general at Oeyras. The literary subsidy, as it is denominated,\r\narising from an impost upon cattle in this province, is important\r\nenough. But there was not till within this few years a single royal\r\nprofessor, as they are so imposingly styled, in any part of it, for\r\neither the primitive letters or Latin; but instead of any knowledge of\r\nthe classics being diffused amongst the population of the Brazil, by\r\nthese titled masters, it is altogether unlettered; in fact, I have seen\r\nsome of those royal preceptors unattended by a single pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP.

But these benefits are but the dawnings of future civilization\r\nand improvement.\r\n\r\nJohn III. in pursuance of his good wishes towards the Brazil,\r\ndetermined to partition the coast into capitanias, and that denominated\r\nMaranhao, was presented by his Majesty to the historian Joam de Barros.\r\nIt is probable that this part of the coast had acquired that name from\r\nthe circumstance of V. Y. Pinson, after his discovery of Cape St.\r\nAugustin, having entered a gulf or the mouth of a great river, which\r\nwas unquestionably the Amazons, and whose waters not possessing the\r\nsaline qualities of the ocean, he called Mara-non, (not sea.) Hence\r\nfollowed the Portuguese denomination of this territory Maranhao, and\r\nMaranham by the English, resulting from the false notion which the\r\nPortuguese at first entertained that it was the great river. Its\r\ndonatory, Joam de Barros, being a man of noble spirit, and determined\r\nto do the utmost for the colonization of this important donation,\r\nunited with his own inadequate means those of the Cavalheiros Fernando\r\nAlvarez and Ayres da Cunha. It was unanimously agreed that Ayres da\r\nCunha should be intrusted with the settlement of the colony, which\r\nsailed from Lisbon in 1535, consisting of nine hundred persons,\r\nincluding two sons of the donatory, with the important addition of one\r\nhundred and thirteen horses.\r\n\r\nThis armament, comprising ten vessels, and considered the most powerful\r\nthat had sailed for a long period from the Tagus, was unfortunately\r\nwrecked upon the shoals which surround the island of Maranham. Some\r\npersons escaped to the island of Medi or Boqueirao at the entrance\r\nof the bay; but which not being adapted for the foundation of the\r\ncolony, they abandoned and returned to Portugal by the first vessel\r\nthat appeared, excepting one individual, a blacksmith, called Pedro,\r\nor Pero, who remained among the Indians, and rendered himself highly\r\nimportant and exceedingly useful to them, in consequence of the variety\r\nof instruments he constructed of the iron taken from the fragments of\r\nthe wreck that were washed upon the beach. A daughter of a cacique, or\r\nprince, was bestowed upon him in marriage, by whom he had two sons,\r\nboth called Pedros, or Peros, from which the Indians thought the\r\nPortuguese all had this name, and they usually gave that nation the\r\nappellation of Peros.\r\n\r\nThe severe disappointment which Barros sustained, not only in the\r\nloss of his property but of his two sons, by this terrible disaster,\r\ndeterred him from making any further attempt. And the same monarch gave\r\nthis territory to Luiz de Mello, and furnished him with three ships and\r\ntwo caravels, that he might the more effectually execute his project,\r\nwhich was to penetrate by the river Amazons as far as the eastern\r\nmines of Peru. He was not, however, much less unfortunate than Ayres\r\nda Cunha, the whole of the armament being lost near the same place,\r\nexcepting one caravel that escaped, and with which he returned to\r\nLisbon. These misfortunes attending the vessels that entered even the\r\nbest anchorage place of this province discouraged all those persons who\r\nwere capable of colonizing its fertile land, but did not prevent its\r\nbeing visited by other nations.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1594 M. Rifault, a Frenchman, entered the port of Maranham\r\nwith three sail, where he left Charles Vaux and a small number of\r\nhis crew. This weak colony was reinforced in the year 1612 by M.\r\nRavardiere. Two years afterwards Jeronimo d’Albuquerque Coelho was\r\ndespatched from Pernambuco by order of the governor, Gaspar de Souza,\r\nto expel those intruders, over whom, after some attacks, he gained\r\nvery little advantage, by a capitulation which he entered into with\r\nthem. Alexandre de Moura, who arrived there the following year with a\r\nstrong force, proposed, instead of the capitulation, the evacuation\r\nof the place by the French, to which their commander, from the weak\r\ncondition of the colony, was under the necessity of acceding. This\r\nevent, occurring on the 1st of November, induced Moura to give the name\r\nof Todos os Santos to the island, which it did not however long retain.\r\n\r\nJeronimo d’Albuquerque was left here by Alexandre de Moura with the\r\npost of captao-mor, and was instructed to found a povoaçao and continue\r\nthe conquest of this new province on account of the government. He\r\npreferred the situation which had been selected by the French, where\r\nhe commenced the capital, in the increase and defence of which he was\r\noccupied till the year 1618, when he died, and was succeeded by his\r\nson, Antonio d’Albuquerque, as temporary governor for more than a year,\r\nwhen Domingos da Costa Machado was appointed to this situation. In\r\nthe beginning of his government Jorge de Lemos arrived there with two\r\nhundred families from the Azores, in three vessels, at his own cost.\r\n\r\nIn 1621 there was a very great mortality amongst the domestic Indians,\r\ncaused by the small pox. Part of this loss was remedied in the same\r\nyear by the transmission of forty families, also from the islands\r\nof the Azores, by the provedor-mor, Antonio Ferraira Bitancourt, in\r\npursuance of an arrangement made with the crown.\r\n\r\nAntonio Moniz Barreiros succeeded to this government in 1622, to whom\r\nthe senate, in the name of the people, presented a requisition that he\r\nwould not consent to the establishment of the Jesuits there, as it was\r\nthought the introduction of their principles among the Indians would\r\nnot be favourable to the colonists. He established two sugar works,\r\nin accomplishment of the obligation his father, of the same name, was\r\nunder from being appointed provedor-mor of the treasury at Bahia.\r\n\r\nSome time before Barreiros began his government the court of Madrid (in\r\n1621) resolved to form the conquests of Maranham into a new state of\r\nthe same name, and for its governor was nominated D. Diogo de Carcoma,\r\nwhose refusal occasioned the appointment of D. Francisco de Moura. This\r\nindividual not going, Francisco Coelho de Carvalho was elected, who\r\nsailed from the Tagus in March, 1624, and disembarked at Pernambuco,\r\nwhere the irruptions of the Dutch detained him nearly two years, so\r\nthat he did not arrive at the capital of Maranham till 1626, having\r\npreviously taken possession of the fort of Siara, which then formed a\r\npart of this province. In the following year he visited the province\r\nof Grand Para and entered the bay of Gurupy, where he established a\r\npovoaçao, which he called Vera Cruz, and died in the twelfth year of\r\nhis government.\r\n\r\nIn 1641, when John IV. again had an ambassador at the Dutch court,\r\nwhich had recognised him as the legitimate sovereign of Portugal, a\r\nDutch vessel arrived at Maranham, under the pretence of having been\r\ndriven there by a violent tempest, and requested that assistance which\r\nin such cases is customary for friendly nations to afford to each\r\nother. The credulous friendship of the governor was taken advantage\r\nof by the Dutch, who suddenly possessed themselves of the capital,\r\nand with facility subjugated the rest of the province; from whence,\r\nhowever, they were expelled by the Portuguese in 1643.\r\n\r\nAll the governors of this province had not the titles of\r\ncaptains-general of the state; occasionally Grand Para enjoyed this\r\npre-eminence. All proceedings that admitted of appeal after the\r\nsentence of the magistrates, in all the provinces, were always referred\r\nto the court, and their bishops immediately upon creation became\r\nsuffragans of the metropolitan of Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe subjection of the Portuguese nation to a foreign sceptre, the\r\npretensions of the Dutch to the Brazil, afterwards the prolonged war\r\npreceding the reversion of the crown, and, finally, the alleged long\r\nexisting destructive abuses of the Braganza family, are adduced as\r\nplausible reasons for the unflourishing state of the Brazil for nearly\r\na century and a half.\r\n\r\nWith the change of hemisphere the first colonists are also said to\r\nhave changed their customs, entering into the pursuits of agriculture\r\nwith no spirit, alike regarding improvement and instruction with\r\nindifference, and preferring the idiom of the barbarous Tupinambas to\r\ntheir own. The various Jesuitical missionaries, however, made great\r\nprogress in the conversion of the Indians, and in which they would have\r\nbeen more successful had not the colonists degenerated so much and\r\nrelaxed in their obedience to the laws. The Portuguese language began\r\nto be generally used in the year 1755, and at this epoch agriculture\r\nassumed a more flourishing aspect, in consequence of the creation of\r\na public company, which included the province of Para. Its capital\r\namounted to one million two hundred thousand crusades, which was\r\nraised by twelve hundred shares; the possession of ten shares rendered\r\neach individual eligible to the administration of the affairs of the\r\ncompany, which was decried by some as introductory of ignorance and a\r\nsystem of destruction.\r\n\r\nThis province is bounded on the north by the ocean, on the west by the\r\nprovince of Para, on the south by those of Goyaz and Piauhy, and on\r\nthe east by the latter. It is of a triangular form, extending nearly\r\nfour hundred miles from north to south on its western side, and about\r\nthree hundred and fifty miles from west to east along the coast, lying\r\nbetween 1° and 7½° south latitude. Its vicinity to the equator renders\r\nthe climate hot. The thunderstorms introduce the winter season, which\r\nbegin in the southern districts about the month of October, where the\r\nlongest day is twelve hours and a half. In the northern part of the\r\nprovince there is scarcely any difference between the day and night all\r\nthe year. The country is mostly uneven, but without any mountains of\r\nconsiderable elevation. It has large and numerous rivers, and is mainly\r\ncovered with woods, affording a variety and abundance of excellent\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\nRIVERS, PORTS, AND ISLANDS.--About two miles within the bar\r\nof the channel of Tutoya, (the western branch of the river Parnahyba\r\nand the eastern limits of this province,) the river of the same name\r\nis discharged, after a short course, being only of note as far as the\r\ntide ascends. In front of its mouth is a small island, which forms an\r\nanchorage place.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles to the west of Tutoya bar is the Perguicas, which is\r\nlarge, and affords good anchorage for small vessels within the eastern\r\npoint. Following a handsome beach of white sand for about thirty miles,\r\ndenominated the Lancoes, and at its termination another of about twelve\r\nmiles, covered with mangroves, is the river Marim, which flows through\r\na fertile soil and is discharged by three mouths. Passing the western\r\nmouth of this river the coast changes its direction to the south-west,\r\nand forms a gulf or bay of about thirty-five miles in extent, in which\r\nis situated the island of Maranham, (twenty miles long from north-east\r\nto south-west, and fifteen at its greatest width,) forming, with the\r\ncontinent, two bays, one to the east, called St. Joze, and the other to\r\nthe west, St. Marcos, each about six miles in width, communicating by a\r\nnarrow strait, denominated the river Mosquito, fifteen miles long, and\r\nseparating the island from the continent: this island, almost covered\r\nwith woods, has some eminences and fifteen perennial streams.\r\n\r\nSeven miles beyond the Marim the Perea discharges itself, and is\r\nnavigable for a considerable distance. Almost in front of it is an\r\nisland of the same name, near to which is another, called Raza, and not\r\nfar distant that of St. Anna. The river Moconandiva follows, and after\r\nit the Mamuna, which is discharged by two mouths, the western one being\r\ncalled Aragatuba; the interval between it and the Perea, about twelve\r\nmiles, is an archipelago. Twenty-eight miles further is discharged\r\nthe large river Mony, which originates about twenty-five miles from\r\nthe margin of the Parnahyba, and six miles above its mouth receives\r\nthe Iguara, which waters a country where the necessaries of life are\r\nonly partially cultivated. Three miles west of the Mony is the vast\r\nembouchure of the large river Itapicuru, being the most considerable\r\nof the province. It originates in the district of Balsas, the most\r\nsouthern portion of Maranham, where it already assumes the appearance\r\nof a large river, running north-east to Cachias, one hundred miles\r\nabove which it receives on the left the Alpercatas, of equal size,\r\nand which comes from the territory of the Tymbyra Indians, whither it\r\naffords navigation to canoes. In Cachias it changes its direction to\r\nthe north-west, and passes by two parishes of the same name, where the\r\ntide and the navigation of large barks with the sail terminate. Its\r\ncurrent is rapid and the course winding, generally through extensive\r\nwoods. The fishermen who use the line about the heads of this river,\r\noccasionally catch a species of small eel whose electric powers are\r\ngreater than the _torpedo_, conveying its influence up the line\r\nand rod, and benumbing the arm, so that it cannot be moved; this\r\nelectrical effect is attributed to a stone the fish has in its head,\r\nand which is much esteemed by the superstitious, who attach many\r\nvirtues to it. Humboldt tried many interesting experiments with this\r\nfish, whose electric fire is exhausted after many discharges; amongst\r\nother trials of its power were the driving horses into a pond and\r\ncompelling them to withstand the gradually decreasing shocks of a great\r\nmany of them. The two last rivers enter the bay of St. Joze.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles further west, at the bottom of the bay of St.\r\nMarcos and the same distance south-west of the capital is the mouth\r\nof the large river Meary, or Mearim, sometimes called Maranham, which\r\noriginates also in the southern part of the province, describing\r\nnumerous windings, and increasing by the addition of various streams,\r\namong which is the Grajehu. Its bed is deep and wide, and the current\r\nso rapid that it suspends the progress of the tide for a considerable\r\nperiod, and produces by this opposition an extraordinary agitation\r\nof the waters, which is called _Pororocas_; when the tide has\r\nvanquished its opponent it flows up for three hours with astonishing\r\nrapidity. This phenomenon occupies a space of nearly fifteen\r\nmiles, occasioning a loud noise, and there are situations, called\r\n_esperas_, where canoes wait until the tide re-advances, and then\r\ncontinue their voyage without danger. This large river, which has the\r\nleast depth at its extended mouth where vessels can only enter with the\r\ntide, affords navigation to the centre of the province, where a large\r\nfall interrupts it. It traverses the territories of the Gamella Indians\r\nand other barbarous nations. In the vicinity of the sea it flows\r\nthrough fine campinhas of fertile land, where cattle are raised, a\r\ndiversity of the necessaries of life, and cotton. One of its principal\r\nand last confluents is the Pinnare, up which small craft proceed to\r\nthe town of Vianna. The coast beyond the Mearim inclines to the north,\r\nforming a bay ten miles in extent, about fifteen miles beyond which is\r\nthe bay of Cuma, nine miles long and three wide, open to the east, and\r\nreceiving the river Piracunan.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles further is the bay called Cabello da Velha, six miles\r\nwide, nearly of equal length, and receiving the river Cururupu. Its\r\nentrance is between two small islands surrounded with dangerous shoals.\r\nIn the proximity of the shore, half way between the two last bays,\r\nis a file of five islands, thickly covered with woods; the largest\r\nis about four miles in length. About twenty miles further, the coast\r\nbeing bordered by the same number of islands, is the embouchure of the\r\nTurynana, which has an extensive course and here affords good anchorage\r\nfor small vessels. In front of this is the island of St. Joam, the most\r\nwesterly of those alluded to; it is ten miles long from north-east to\r\nsouth-west, flat, covered with woods, and occupied by birds and wild\r\nquadrupeds. A profound channel, three miles in width, separates it from\r\nthe continent; near its north-eastern point there is safe anchorage.\r\n\r\nFurther westward is the vast bay of Turyvassu, the limits of the\r\nprovince on the side of Para. It receives a river of the same name,\r\nafter flowing a great distance through extensive woods. The Indians,\r\nwho, under various appellations had the dominion of the island of\r\nMaranham and the adjoining continent, were Tupinambas, and divided into\r\nsmall tribes.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Calcareous stone, copperas, alum, iron, lead, and silver,\r\nantimony, amianthus, saltpetre, mineral salt, crystals, grindstone, and\r\nquarries or rocks of granite.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--The Asiatic cocoa-nut tree grows sparingly, and only along\r\nthe coast. The pine is common, and fructifies in perfection. From the\r\nfruit of the _mamona_ is extracted almost all the oil which is used for\r\nlights. Here are trees of gum copal, storax, mastick, bensoin, dragons’\r\nblood, the oil of cupahyba, or capivi, the _arariba_, from whose bark\r\nis extracted a beautiful crimson colour, the _barbatimoe_, cajue-nut\r\n_ambuzo_, cocoa, _jabuticaba_, _mangaba_, _aracaza_, _babonilha_,\r\n_butua_, ginger, jalap, ipecacuanha, and the palm. The cane prospers in\r\nmany situations, but its culture has been supplanted by that of cotton,\r\nwhich constitutes the main article of exportation, and the principal\r\nwealth of the country. Amongst resinous trees is also the _sucuba_,\r\nthe gum of which passes for the ammoniac of the Levant. The deity who\r\npresides over grain, the lifesustaining Ceres, has here but little\r\ninfluence, and rice only is cultivated, but to a very great extent;\r\nthe soil is equally well adapted to the produce of Indian corn. The\r\nirregularity of the seasons does not permit the cultivation of wheat,\r\nrye, or barley. Water-melons, melons, and pine-apples are excellent.\r\nThe indigenous banana tree produces fruit in immense profusion and of\r\nthe best quality.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--Cattle, sheep, and goats multiply here better than\r\nin the countries from which they were imported, but do not improve in\r\nsize nor in the flavour of their meat, neither are they very numerous,\r\nwith the exception of the first. Mules are bred here, also hogs, equal\r\nto the consumption of the country. All the species of wild animals\r\nare met with, peculiar to the eastern provinces. The _moco_ is\r\nnumerous in all parts. The birds of the plains, woods, and lakes, known\r\nin the other districts, are common here; and the handsome _guara_\r\nabound in the proximity of the sea. There is in this part of South\r\nAmerica a particular species of silk worm, more prolific than the\r\nordinary kinds of Bombay or Persia. The colour of the silk is a dark\r\nyellow, and might be rendered a considerable branch of commerce,\r\nin consequence of the facility which would attend its abundant\r\ncultivation, if any adequate attention was afforded to it. The insect\r\nreceives its nourishment from leaves of the orange and the pine tree,\r\nor _atta_, which is common in its native country.\r\n\r\nAll the territory lying between the rivers Itapicuru and the Parnahyba\r\nhas been for many years evacuated by the Indians, as well as the\r\nnorthern part of that to the west of the first river, and is more or\r\nless inhabited by whites, and Christianized Indians, mainly occupied in\r\nthe cultivation of mandioca, Indian corn, and legumes, and above all\r\nin the two vegetable articles of exportation, rice and cotton, almost\r\nall the labour being performed by the hands of negroes, who exceed by\r\nmany times the number of the others. Families live for the most part\r\ndispersed. A certain proportion of land, where each cultivator dwells,\r\ngenerally with all his family and slaves, is of itself considered an\r\naldeia. There are few aldeias compared with the extent of the province,\r\nhaving any considerable number of families, with the exception of those\r\nwhich have been created parishes, many comprising sixty miles or more\r\nof district. Excellent nets used for sleeping, and some coarse cottons,\r\nmade into dresses, generally for slaves, are manufactured here.\r\n\r\nThe southern portion of the western district of this province is\r\nstill in the possession of the Indians, as well as a great extent\r\nof the central part. The most northern tribe, bordering upon the\r\nPortuguese, are called by them the _Gamel__las_, in consequence of\r\ntheir prevailing custom of perforating and distending the under lip,\r\nwith a sort of calabash, or round piece of wood, which produces some\r\nresemblance to a small gamella, or wooden bowl. They cultivate various\r\nnecessaries of life, and live in cabanas, when they are not out upon\r\ntheir hunting excursions, or gathering wild fruits. Their arms are the\r\nbow and arrow, and a club of hard wood, denominated a _mataranna_,\r\ncornered at the thicker end and pointed at the other.\r\n\r\nThe Timbyras occupy the country to the south of them, and are divided\r\ninto two hordes, one denominated Timbyras da Matta, (of the wood,)\r\nfrom living in the interior of forests; the other, Timbyras de Canella\r\nFina, from the delicate form of their legs. They rove in the desert\r\nplains, and are of such amazing velocity, that they equal the swiftness\r\nof the horse. All use a bow made of a species of small club, and\r\nanother large one of violet wood, and flat. Those of the woods have in\r\ntheir territory a large lake, and mines of salt, which they use, and\r\ncultivate mandioca and other necessaries, also some cotton, of which\r\nthey make their hammocks. They distil various beverages, more or less\r\ninebriating, which last only for a short time, arising as much from\r\nthe quality as the excess with which they use them. From the period\r\nthey begin to drink them, till they are finished, are days of folly,\r\ndedicated to tumultuous dancing and dissension.\r\n\r\nProceeding southward, the Manajos are met with, who are of a white\r\ncomplexion, and occupy a country to the west of Balsas, extending\r\nthemselves to the margin of the Tucantins, where they receive the\r\nname of Temembos. In their vicinity dwell the Bus and Cupinharos.\r\nThe territory bounding this province and Para is inhabited by the\r\nGê Indians, who are divided into five tribes, distinguished by the\r\nappellations of Auge, Crange, Cannacatage, Poncatage, and Paycoge, and\r\nalmost without any difference of language or customs.\r\n\r\nThe towns of this province are--\r\n\r\n    Alcantara\r\n    Guimarens\r\n    St. Joam de Cortes\r\n    Vianna\r\n    Moncao\r\n    Hycatu\r\n    Cachias\r\n    Tury\r\n    Vinhaes\r\n    Passo do Lumiar\r\n    Maranham.\r\n\r\nAlcantara, about ten miles north-west of the capital is a large\r\ntown, with good houses, and agreeably situated upon elevated ground,\r\nhaving four hermitages, a convent of slippered Carmalites, another\r\nof Mercenaries, and a fort, seated upon the site where a Jesuitical\r\nhospicio existed. It was for some time the capital of the capitania of\r\nCuma, which terminated in the bay of Turyvassu, and its port is capable\r\nof receiving sumacas. The cotton raised in its district is esteemed the\r\nbest of the province. This article and rice constitute the principal\r\nproductions of the inhabitants. The salterns, three miles north of it,\r\nare capable of furnishing excellent salt to many provinces, if they\r\nwere administered, as in the time of the Jesuits, to whom they belonged.\r\n\r\nGuimarens is a flourishing town, situated upon the northern side of\r\nthe bay of Cuma, thirty miles north-north-west of Alcantara, with a\r\nchurch of St. Joze. From its port are exported cotton, rice, and a\r\nconsiderable quantity of farinha.\r\n\r\nSt. Joam de Cortes is a small and insignificant town, eighteen miles\r\nsouth of Guimarens, on the southern margin of the bay of Cuma,\r\nproducing farinha, with some cotton and rice.\r\n\r\nVianna is a middling town, and well situated upon the margin of the\r\nMaracu, a branch of the Pinnare, in the vicinity of a large lake,\r\nabout one hundred miles from the capital. The church is dedicated to\r\nOur Lady of Conceiçao; and its inhabitants raise cotton, mandioca, and\r\nother necessaries of life common to the country. They breed cattle and\r\ncollect timber. In its district there is one of the best sugar works of\r\nthe province, and formerly belonging to the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nMoncao, eighteen miles south of Vianna, is a small Indian town, with\r\na church, upon the banks of the Pinnare. Its inhabitants raise the\r\nprovisions of life, some cotton, and follow fishing and hunting.\r\n\r\nHycatu, (good water,) an ancient town, and formerly considerable and\r\nflourishing, is situated near the confluence of the Hyguara with\r\nthe Mony, and has a church of Our Lady of Conceiçao. It was the\r\nfirst residence of the governors of the province, and conceded many\r\nprivileges to its senate. An excellent quality of cotton constitutes\r\nthe chief production of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nCachias, a considerable and flourishing town upon the eastern margin\r\nof the Itapicuru, is two hundred miles south-east of the capital, and\r\nnearly the same distance north-north-west of Oeyras. It has a church\r\nof Our Lady of Conceiçao, and a hermitage of Razario; Aldeias Altas\r\nwas its primitive name. A Juiz de Fora has presided over its senate\r\nsince the year 1809. The propensity to gambling amongst its inhabitants\r\nhas occasioned the ruin of many merchants of the capital. Within its\r\nextensive district a very great quantity of cotton and rice is grown,\r\nfor whose transmission to the parish of Rozario barks of considerable\r\nburden are constructed for navigating in shoal water.\r\n\r\nUpon the other side of the river is the parish of Trezidellas, whose\r\nparishioners are descended from the Aborigines. They have a church of\r\nOur Lady of Razario.\r\n\r\nOne hundred miles above Cachias, and upon the margin of the Itapicuru,\r\nis the small arraial of Principe Regente, commenced in June, 1807.\r\nThe fertility of its surrounding country and the advantage arising\r\nfrom canoes of considerable burden being able to navigate hither augur\r\nfavourably for the future prosperity of this new colony, where a\r\nhermitage already exists.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Balsas is the parish of St. Felis, whose inhabitants\r\nare farmers of cotton and common necessaries.\r\n\r\nThirty miles south-south-west of Principe Regente is the arraial of\r\nSt. Bento Pastos Bons, situated amongst small hills, ten miles from\r\nthe Parnahyba, and twenty-eight from the Itapicuru. Cattle and cotton\r\nconstitute the main property of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThree miles north of Pastos Bons is the aldeia of St. Antonio, whose\r\ndwellers are a tribe of Christianized Manago Indians, who live by\r\nhunting, and some agriculture.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles from the sea, upon the margin of the Itapicuru, is\r\nthe parish of Rozario, better known by the name of Itapicuru Grande,\r\nwhose inhabitants raise cattle and a considerable quantity of rice.\r\nHere large canoes arrive from the capital, and are laden with the\r\nproductions of this district, and those that descend from the High\r\nItapicuru and Balsas.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight miles further, and upon the margin of the same river, is\r\nthe considerable povoaçao of Itapicuru Mirim, with a church of Our Lady\r\nof Griefs, its inhabitants producing large quantities of cotton, and\r\nthe necessaries of life. Between the two preceding parishes is that of\r\nLapa, in the site of St. Miguel.\r\n\r\nUpon the margin of the Mearim, fifty miles from the sea, is the parish\r\nof N. Senhora of Nazareth, whose inhabitants raise cattle, cotton,\r\nrice, &c. without gaining much wealth.\r\n\r\nTury is a villota, or small town, with only the appearance of an\r\naldeia, but which may become more considerable from its situation upon\r\nthe large bay of the same name, and the fertility of its adjacent\r\nterritory, particularly after the pacification of the central Indians.\r\nThe church is dedicated to St. Francisco Xavier.\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the Tutoya, in an advantageous situation, is the\r\nparish of Conceiçao, well supplied with fish and the necessaries of\r\nlife, having a port capable of receiving sumacas, and possessing\r\ngreater depth than any other of the Parnahyba.\r\n\r\nConsiderably to the southward, and two miles from the Parnahyba, is the\r\nparish of St. Bernardo d’ Annapuru, cotton being the production of its\r\ndiversified population.\r\n\r\nVinhaes is a small town, three miles to the east of the capital,\r\nsituated in the same island, upon a stream of its name, with a church\r\ndedicated to St. Joam Baptista. The houses are constructed of wood,\r\nand covered with straw, and its inhabitants are Indians, who fish, and\r\ncultivate various necessaries of life; they also make mats of miassava\r\nfor trimming ships and cords of imbe.\r\n\r\nPasso do Lumiar is the most populous town of Indians in the whole\r\nprovince, and is in the centre of the island, upon the river St.\r\nJoam. The church is of stone, dedicated to Our Lady of Luz, and its\r\ninhabitants are of divers nations, cultivating excellent tobacco, rice,\r\nmandioca, &c.; they are also woodcutters and fishermen.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern extremity of the island there is a considerable aldeia,\r\npleasantly situated, with a hermitage of St. Joze, from which the bay\r\nalready mentioned takes the name.\r\n\r\nThis island is of medium altitude, the soil in general fertile, and\r\nappropriated to different branches of agriculture.\r\n\r\nMARANHAM, or St. Luiz, the capital of the province, is a\r\ncity advanced to rather more than a state of mediocrity, having about\r\nthirty thousand inhabitants; and, although it may be said to rank\r\nthe lowest among four great commercial cities of the Brazil, yet its\r\namount of commerce is not far short of Pernambuco, and it certainly has\r\nmaintained a progression of improvement with the latter city, as well\r\nas Bahia, since the removal of the Royal Family to this region. It is\r\nsituated upon the western part of the island of the same name, between\r\nthe mouth of two streams, rendered important rivers by the addition\r\nof the tide, which advances nearly to their origins, and swells them\r\nconsiderably. The one north of the city is called the St. Francisco,\r\nas far as the confluence of the Anil with that of Vinhaes, neither\r\nof which are more than six miles in extent. The other, on the south,\r\ndenominated the Maranham, is a handsome current, and receives by its\r\nnorthern margin the Baccanga.\r\n\r\nThis town was created a bishopric in the year 1676, and is ornamented\r\nwith a house of Misericordia, convents of slippered Carmelites, of\r\nMercenarios, and of Franciscans; a recolhimento for women, and a\r\nhospital. The ci-devant Jesuitical college is converted into the\r\nepiscopal palace, and its church into the cathedral. The houses\r\nhave verandas and do not differ from the general style of Portuguese\r\nbuildings. The streets are paved, and disagreeably crowded with\r\nslaves, producing the same ungracious feelings in this respect as are\r\npeculiar to all towns of the Brazil. It is divided into two parishes,\r\none of them being attached to the cathedral dedicated to Nossa Senhora\r\nof Victoria, and the other to Nossa Senhora da Conceiçao. It has a\r\ncourt of Relacam, which Pernambuco does not yet possess, created in\r\nthe year 1812, and having a jurisdiction over an extensive district,\r\ncomprehending not only the comarcas of Maranham, Piauhy, Para, and\r\nRio Negro, but also of Siara, as well as all the other comarcas and\r\njudicatures, which, in the provinces referred to, may be created _de\r\nnovo_. The members of this Relacam are composed of the governor,\r\nthe chancellor, and at most of nine dezembargadors, which latter is\r\na title given to those eligible to or holding posts of judicature,\r\nouvidorships, &c. Here is also a tribunal of the Real Fazenda, a\r\nPort Admiral, and Royal Professors of the Primitive Letters, Latin,\r\nRhetorick, and Philosophy, similar in their import and effect to\r\nthose of other places. It is scarcely necessary to observe, after the\r\ndescription of the province, that cotton and rice are the principal\r\nexportations from this city. Its cotton has required the repute of\r\nbeing next in quality to that of Pernambuco, and obtains in the British\r\nmarket a price within 1½d per lb. of that cotton, and 1d. per lb. above\r\nthat of Bahia. The export of cotton from Maranham, the year after the\r\narrival of the Royal Family in the Brazil, was upwards of seventy\r\nthousand bags; it fell the two following years to fifty thousand, and\r\nthe next year to forty thousand, but rose again to sixty thousand in\r\nthe year 1813, from which period to 1817 its average may be estimated\r\nat sixty thousand bags. The following is a correct statement of the\r\nexports in 1818 and 1819.\r\n\r\n                          For the year 1818.\r\n\r\n    =========+==============+===============+===============+======+\r\n    Number of|Destination.  |    Cotton.    |     Rice.     |Hides.|\r\n    vessels. |              |               |               |      |\r\n             |              |               |               |      |\r\n    ---------+--------------+------+--------+------+--------+------+\r\n             |              | Bags.|Arrobas.| Bags.|Arrobas.|   No.|\r\n        25   |Lisbon        |16,294|  88,488|43,212| 224,263|  5131|\r\n        16   |Oporto        | 3,251|  18,595|25,037| 132,167|  1027|\r\n         1   |Cape de Verds |    14|      73|  ----|    ----|  ----|\r\n         1   |Antwerp       |   500|   3,040|   305|   1,666|   418|\r\n         1   |Surinam       |    25|     157|  ----|    ----|   712|\r\n         1   |Boston        |     8|      48|  ----|    ----|  1659|\r\n         1   |Gibraltar     |   156|     780|  ----|    ----|  ----|\r\n         2   |St. Maloes    |   511|   2,976|  ----|    ----|   420|\r\n         5   |Havre de Grace| 3,888|  21,472|   372|   1,997|    30|\r\n         2   |London        | 1,687|   8,835|  ----|    ----|  ----|\r\n        49   |Liverpool     |47,396| 258,329|  ----|    ----|  ----|\r\n    ---------+              +------+--------+------+--------+------+\r\n       104   |              |73,730| 402,793|68,926| 360,095|  9433|\r\n    =========+==============+===============+===============+======+\r\n\r\n    =========+==============+========+====+===========+======+\r\n    Number of|Destination.  | Tanned |Gum.|  Farhina, |Indian|\r\n    vessels. |              |Leather.|    |or Flour of| Corn.|\r\n             |              |        |    | Mandioca. |      |\r\n    ---------+--------------+--------+----+-----------+------+\r\n             |              | Pieces.|lbs.|   Sacks.  |Sacks.|\r\n        25   |Lisbon        |  32,503|1501|    250    |  ----|\r\n        16   |Oporto        |   6,116| 202|     --    |  1389|\r\n         1   |Cape de Verds |    ----|----|     --    |  ----|\r\n         1   |Antwerp       |    ----|----|     --    |  ----|\r\n         1   |Surinam       |    ----|----|     --    |  ----|\r\n         1   |Boston        |    ----|----|     --    |  ----|\r\n         1   |Gibraltar     |    ----|----|     --    |  ----|\r\n         2   |St. Maloes    |    ----|----|     --    |  ----|\r\n         5   |Havre de Grace|    ----|----|     --    |  ----|\r\n         2   |London        |    ----|----|     --    |  ----|\r\n        49   |Liverpool     |    ----|----|     --    |  ----|\r\n    ---------+              +--------+----+-----------+------+\r\n       104   |              |  38,619|1703|    250    |  1389|\r\n    =========+==============+========+====+===========+======+\r\n\r\n    =========+==============+=============+==============+\r\n    Number of|Destination.  |Total freight|Total value   |\r\n    vessels. |              |to each Port.|at each Port. |\r\n             |              |             |              |\r\n    ---------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n             |              |             |Milreas.

Two-thirds of this\r\narticle from Maranham is sent principally to the port of Liverpool,\r\nfrom whence the greatest portion of manufactured goods for the\r\nconsumption of the province are shipped, and our merchants labour\r\nunder the same disadvantage here as at Bahia and Pernambuco, in having\r\nno alternative but taking produce for the whole of their importations,\r\nwhich necessarily keeps up the price much above the proportionable\r\npar of the British market. There is a singular coincidence in the\r\ncommercial intercourse of the two countries, relative to cotton.\r\nNearly the amount of the annual Brazilian exports to England of this\r\narticle is returned to that country in a manufactured state in the\r\ncourse of the following year; and, notwithstanding all the ingenuity\r\nof machinery, talent, and superior intelligence brought into the scale\r\non the part of the British manufacturer and merchant, the Brazilians\r\nhave decidedly the advantage over them in the progression of continued\r\ngain and enrichment. The illiterate and uncultivated planter derives\r\nhis wealth from the refined state of British manufactures and commerce,\r\nwhile their votaries have for sometime, and are yet sustaining serious\r\ninjury by this portion at least of their transatlantic intercourse.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the exports from this city, as well as Pernambuco,\r\nmay be lessened so far as regards the Fora cottons, or those coming\r\nfrom the adjoining provinces, which are acquiring by degrees a direct\r\nintercourse with Europe, and not as hitherto through the medium of\r\nthose ports. In the provinces where establishments are forming, the\r\ngovernors are desirous of concentrating the whole of its productions\r\nthrough the medium of the head town, in order to increase the revenues\r\nof their jurisdictions. It may be observed again, that it is English\r\nestablishments branching from this city and Pernambuco principally that\r\nafford these advantages to the rising provinces of Para, Parahiba, Rio\r\nGrande de Norte, and Siara.\r\n\r\nThis city is well supplied with fish, water, meat, and fine fruits.\r\nThree fortifications defend its port, which is diminishing in depth\r\nof water. The tide rises here twenty-eight palms, but there is\r\nconsiderable intricacy, attended with danger, in vessels approaching\r\nthe anchorage place. Amongst the English merchants established here,\r\nthe Consul ranks as one. There is an English hospital amply provided\r\nwith means from the contribution fund. The governors of the provinces\r\nare usually changed every three years. General Silveira is here the\r\npresent governor.\r\n\r\nA provisional constitutional government was formed here in April, 1821,\r\nto continue in force till the basis of the Portuguese constitution\r\nshould be fixed. The popular feeling was in favour of a government to\r\nconsist of five or six members; but, after some contention, the first\r\nwas adopted, General Silveira declining to remain at the head of the\r\ncouncil upon any other condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAP.

Various Indian nations opposed\r\nthe establishment of this colony, principally the Tupinambazes, the\r\nremains and descendants of various hordes of the numerous Tupinamba\r\ntribe, under whose dominion the sertams of Pernambuco were, when the\r\nPortuguese extended their conquests into the interior of that province.\r\nNot being able to resist the progress of their invaders, they fled\r\nfrom them to the margins of the Tucantins and the Amazons.\r\n\r\nThe attacks of the Indians upon the new settlers increased with the\r\npretensions of the Dutch to the country, who inspired them with\r\nenthusiasm for conquest; the ardour of which was augmented, by the\r\nattempts of some small parties of English and French upon the Amazons.\r\nCaldeira was regarded by the Portuguese as an intrepid commander, but\r\nwas wanting in equity, and the necessary qualifications to found a\r\ncolony amongst these savage tribes.\r\n\r\nThe barbarous assassination, by a near relation of his, of a Captain\r\nesteemed by the whole colony, led to the termination of his government.\r\nHe pretended to expiate the atrocity of his relative by a few days\r\nimprisonment; and rigorously treated two honourable men who boldly\r\nrequired from him a punishment adequate to the crime of the murderer.\r\nThe circumstances attending it produced a considerable tumult, from\r\nwhich resulted his imprisonment in 1618.\r\n\r\nIn the intermediate short government of Captain Balthazar Rodrigues\r\nde Mello, the colony was assaulted with such intrepidity, by the\r\nTupinambazes, that the issue would have been doubtful, if the chief of\r\nthe Indians, denominated by the Portuguese, Cabello da Velha, had not\r\nfallen dead soon after the commencement of the attack.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1619, shortly after the Indians had retired, Jeronimo\r\nFragozo d’Albuquerque arrived from Pernambuco, being appointed by Don\r\nLuiz de Souza to transmit the prisoner Caldeira to the Court, and to\r\nsucceed him in the government, which he commenced with various success,\r\nby means of an armament, of which he took the direction, having for\r\nhis Admiral the celebrated Pedro Teyxeyra. At the moment of exultation\r\nafter these advantages, Captain Bento Maciel arrived, from Pernambuco,\r\nwith an auxiliary force of eighty Portuguese, and four hundred\r\ndisciplined Indians, to assist in the prosecution of the war against\r\nthe Tupinambazes.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, the death of the governor occurred, which was\r\nfollowed by the installation of Mathias d’Albuquerque, who was deposed,\r\nunder some pretext, in the course of twenty days. He was succeeded by\r\nCaptain Custodio Valente, Frey Antonio, guardian of the Capuchins, and\r\nCaptain Pedro Teyxeyra, who governed alone after the departure of the\r\nfirst for Lisbon, and the resignation of the second.\r\n\r\nHis government was short, the before-mentioned Bento Maciel succeeding\r\nhim in the year 1621. He expelled the Dutch, already established\r\nupon both margins of the Amazons; destroyed some hordes of the most\r\ncourageous savages, obliged others to fly, and induced many to come\r\nand offer peace and sincere friendship to the colony; thereby acquiring\r\nthe title of the conqueror of Maranham, by which name the river Amazons\r\nwas also designated. In his government the Jesuitical Missionaries made\r\ngreat progress.\r\n\r\nIn 1624, Manuel de Souza d’Eca succeeded him, by royal patent, an\r\nhonour which was not conferred upon any of those who followed him,\r\nin the course of a century. By the active and diligent operations of\r\nthe Missionaries the population became more numerous than that of the\r\neastern province.\r\n\r\nAfter this, some governors had the title of Captain Genera! of the\r\nState of Maranham, as were Joam d’Abreu Castello Branco, who governed\r\nin 1743, and Francisco Xavier de Mendonca, who arrived here in 1751,\r\nalso appointed Plenipotentiary of Demarcation of the high Amazons.\r\n\r\nThe captivity of the Indians, customary in almost all the other\r\nprovinces, and adopted in this since its first foundation, was\r\ncontinued. All labour was performed by the hands of the captive\r\nIndians, of which each colony prided itself in possessing the greatest\r\nnumber: riches were calculated by the quantity of these unfortunates.\r\nThe injustice which was practised in this pretend right over their\r\nlives and liberty, the consequent prevailing disposition to indolence,\r\navarice, and an indifference to vicious practices, engendered crimes\r\namongst the colonists, tending to destroy every good and moral\r\nsentiment. The laws of the state and the sacred obligations of religion\r\nbecame odious to them, as restraints upon their vicious propensities.\r\nThe Jesuit Antonio Viegra was the first, who, in the new state,\r\ndeclaimed with energy against the captivity of the aboriginal natives,\r\nand repaired to the metropolis expressly to solicit the adoption of\r\nmore effectual measures for their liberty; and his colleagues, who\r\nentertained the same sentiments, were expelled at all points from both\r\nprovinces in 1671.\r\n\r\nThe colonists of Para and Maranham were turbulent, and afforded\r\nconsiderable difficulties to the governors on this subject, until King\r\nJoseph issued a salutary law in 1755, which compelled them to observe\r\nthe numerous edicts his ancestors had promulgated without effect in\r\nfavour of the freedom of the Indians. The liberated Indians now passed\r\nunder the inspection of administrators, who made them work generally\r\non certain lands, the produce of which they were paid for out of the\r\ntreasury, until the whole, in the regency of his present Majesty,\r\nwere left to their free will. It is, however, to be remarked that\r\nmany have since resumed the original state of nature, and the others\r\nhave not advanced a step beyond their Indian brethren. The traders\r\nof Matto-Grosso and the high Maranham experience frequent injuries\r\nfrom the non-performance of contracts they make with them, finding\r\nthemselves frequently abandoned in situations of intricate navigation,\r\nwhere they are, in consequence, subjected to great difficulties.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 the Portuguese language began to be generally used here with\r\nthe introduction of negroes, the freedom of the Indians, and the\r\ncreation of the company already alluded to, up to which period the\r\nTupinamba language was universally spoken; even the orators in the\r\npulpit did not use any other.\r\n\r\nThis province is bounded on the north by the ocean and the river\r\nMaranham, or Amazons, which separates it from Guianna; on the west\r\nby the river Madeira; on the south by the provinces of Goyaz and\r\nMatto-Grosso; and on the east by that of Maranham. It extends from the\r\nequator to seven degrees of south latitude, with near eight hundred\r\nmiles in length from east to west, and upwards of four hundred miles\r\nin its greatest width. The climate is invariably hot, even when it\r\nrains; the days and nights are nearly equal all the year, and the\r\nseasons almost prevail together. At the same time that some trees\r\nannounce the autumn, by a profuse exhibition of fruits in a state of\r\nmaturity, others are flourishing in their primitive bloom. The face\r\nof the country is generally flat, almost universally presenting an\r\nagreeable aspect, covered with extensive woods, where trees grow of a\r\nconsiderable height and prodigious girth. The soil in most parts is\r\nhumid, substantial, and of great fertility, affording an abundance of\r\nvarious productions, which, in the other provinces, either do not exist\r\nor but in very small quantities. It also far surpasses all the others\r\nin the number and consequence of its rivers.\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.--Crystals, emeralds, granite, silver, but not yet found in\r\nany quantity, argils, red lead, yellow ochre, from which is extracted\r\nochre tinged with green.\r\n\r\nPHYTOLOGY.--In no other province are trees of such size produced; many\r\nof the most excellent building timber, some for cabinet work, various\r\nkinds affording tow for caulking, or flax for cordage; and the great\r\nAuthor of Nature has created others whose alimentary fruits afford\r\nsustenance to the living creature, the superabundance of which, for the\r\nmost part, is of no utility, in consequence of the diminutive state\r\nof population. Amongst the oil and balsamic trees are to be noted the\r\n_cumaru_ and _cupahyba_, or _capiri_, those of gum-storax are known\r\nhere only by the name of _omiry_. The satin-wood is very valuable;\r\nthe _merapinima_ is compact and heavy, appearing like tortoiseshell\r\nwhen polished; there is the violet wood, the _sucuba_, which distils\r\nby incision a liquor, and taken in certain doses, is an efficacious\r\nremedy against the maw-worm; the _massaranduba_ distils another liquor,\r\nwhich occasionally makes fine gum; the juice of the _assacu_ is one\r\nof the most subtle venoms; the resin of the _getaicica_ is applied\r\nto the varnishing of earthern ware; the ashes of the _chiriuba_ are\r\nesteemed the best known for the manufacture of soap. Among fruit trees\r\nare the orange, _mangaba_, _saracaza_, _cajue_-nut; the _atta_, or\r\npine, is common, and the fruit very fine; the fig and vine are rare and\r\ndo not fructify well; there are, also, the fruits of _abiu_, _inga_,\r\n_assiahy_, _bacaba_, _inaja_, _cotitiriba_, _cupuassu_, _aguru_. The\r\ncocoa-nut trees are seen only in the neighbourhood of the sea; the\r\ncedar is very large and numerous, also the _sapucaya_; the plants of\r\n_vanilla_ and indigo grow spontaneously. The chesnut, that is the tree\r\nto whose fruit is commonly given the name of _castanha do Maranham_,\r\ndiffers from the _sapucaya_, with which it is sometimes confounded.\r\nThe _cautecuc_ passes, and with justice, for one of the most useful\r\ntrees of this province, where it is common; it is of the _euphorbium_\r\nspecies, and from its trunk is extracted, by incision, a liquid, which\r\ncondenses and turns into an elastic gum, with which, through the\r\nmedium of moulds, are made seringes of various kinds, and when its\r\njuice is applied to dress renders it impenetrable to water. The cocoa\r\nshrub, or tree, are of two kinds, one produced by nature, the other by\r\ncultivation. Here is, likewise, sarsaparilla, ipecacuenha, _butua_,\r\njallap, _ginger_; also, the _pechurum_-tree and that affording the\r\nclove, denominated _cravo do Maranham_ and _cucheri_ among the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation has here commenced of the laurel, or bay-tree, similar\r\nto that of the _Mollucas_. The latter is an aromatic drug of such\r\nparticular flavour that nothing could be substituted for it, until\r\nthe seventeenth century, when that of Maranham was discovered, which,\r\nthough different in the form, is otherwise so similar and so adapted to\r\nall the uses of the first that it has caused not only a considerable\r\nreduction in the price, but in the consumption of it among European\r\nnations. The trees that produce it the best, grow in the same latitudes\r\nof Gram Para as the others do in the Mollucca islands, and there is\r\nno doubt that the soil and climate of this province is capable, with\r\nproper management, of producing any thing that any other part of the\r\nworld can afford. The bread fruit tree has been recently introduced and\r\nprospers as in its native soil. The very small portion, indeed, of this\r\npart of the Brazil that is cultivated is appropriated to the culture\r\nof mandioca, Indian corn, legumes, coffee, cotton, the sugar cane, of\r\nwhich the engenhos at present are not numerous, and rice, which is very\r\nabundant; these, with cocoa and other minor productions, principally\r\nengage the attention of agriculturists, who, with the population\r\nand industry, are at a very low ebb, compared to the advantages so\r\npre-eminently offered by a country of such unexampled fertility.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.--All the species of domestic and wild quadrupeds peculiar\r\nto the surrounding provinces are common here, as likewise the most\r\nremarkable birds, such as the parrot, _arrara_, _tucano_, _jacu_,\r\nemu-ostrich, _soco_, _araponga_, _mutun_, _troquaze_ pigeon, partridge,\r\n_jaburu_, divers sorts of geese, _macaricos_, _colhereiras_, _sabias_,\r\nand _colibris_; the _guara_, only met with in the vicinity of salt\r\nwater, is very numerous. Various species of small birds, with a variety\r\nof beautiful plumage, are observed here, totally unknown in the other\r\nprovinces; also, all the kinds of bees common to the Brazil, affording\r\na profusion of honey, in the extensive woods, for the supply of the\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nPORTS AND RIVERS.--Between the bay of Turyuassu and Point\r\nTigioca there are upwards of twenty abundant rivers, each with its\r\nanchorage place for vessels of small burden, more or less commodious,\r\neither within or near their embouchures, the main part being within\r\nbays or spacious gulfs, commonly surrounded with mangroves, abounding\r\nin the _guara_, _macarico_, and other birds that exist upon\r\nshell-fish.\r\n\r\nAs almost all the rivers in this province run into the Amazons, we will\r\nspeak of them in the order in which they enter that great recipient.\r\n\r\nThe river of the Amazons, also called Maranham by the Portuguese, and\r\nGuienna by some Indians, was discovered, after Pinson had passed its\r\nspacious outlet, in the interior of the continent, by his countryman\r\nFrancisco Orellana, who descended by it from the mouth of the Napo\r\nto the ocean, in the year 1539, and, like the wondrous and fabulous\r\nstatements of some of the first discoverers of new countries, he\r\npromulgated a story, that its margins were inhabited by warlike women,\r\narmed with bows, from which it improperly acquired the name by which it\r\nis universally known. In the year 1637, the Portuguese Captain Pedro\r\nTeyxeyra before mentioned, conducted a fleet of forty-seven canoes\r\nfrom Para up the Amazons, to the mouth of the Napo, and advanced up\r\nthe latter as far as it was navigable. On his return, in the following\r\nyear, he gave a circumstantial relation of both rivers, as did the\r\nJesuit Christoval da Cunha, who returned with Teyxeyra from Quito,\r\nbut neither of them met with any of the Amazons Orellana pretended to\r\nhave seen. This river is, without exception, the largest in the world,\r\nhaving a course of upwards of four thousand miles. It is not designated\r\nin the whole of its extent by the names already mentioned. The\r\nPortuguese more frequently call it the Amazons as far as the embouchure\r\nof Rio Negro; from thence upwards the Solimoes, and, at the famous\r\nconfluence of the Ucayale with the Tanguragua, it takes the appellation\r\nof Maranham. It was doubtful for some time which of these was its\r\nprincipal head. The first, unquestionably, has the more extensive\r\ncourse, and is wider at their union than the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Tanguragua issues from lake Hyauricocha, situated in ten and a\r\nhalf degrees of south latitude, in the district of Huanaco, about one\r\nhundred miles north-north-east of Lima. It runs north-north-west for\r\nthe space of three hundred and fifty miles between the two cordilleiras\r\nof the Andes as far as the town of Jaen de Bracamoras, commencing with\r\nthe name of the lake in which it originates. At Bracamoras, where it\r\nbegins to be navigable, it receives the Chinchipe on the left, which\r\ncomes from the north-west; and on the right the Chachapoyas, which\r\nflows from the south-east, both navigable. Here it inclines to the\r\nnorth-east till it receives the Santiago, formed by various torrents,\r\nprecipitated from the mountains of Loxa. In this interval of one\r\nhundred and forty miles, nearly midway, the Tanguragua receives the\r\nChuchunga on the right, navigable for ten miles. It should have been\r\nobserved, that the port of Bracamoras is on its left bank, and that\r\nimmediately below the town its waters are contracted between two\r\nmountains, and, running furiously, descend by various falls. Below\r\nthe Chuchunga it flows through the narrow strait of Cumbinama, and\r\nafterwards by that of Escorregabragas, neither of which are very\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nAt the confluence of the Santiago, the Tanguragua is five hundred yards\r\nin width, and three miles further, running eastward, it begins to\r\nstraighten, traversing the interior cordilleira of the Andes, and is\r\nreduced in the narrowest part to fifty yards. The current descends this\r\ncontracted channel of six miles, denominated Pongo, in the space of one\r\nhour. At its termination is situated the city of Borja.\r\n\r\nSeventy miles below Borja it receives on the left the Marona, which is\r\nnot inferior to the Santiago, descending from the volcano of Sangay,\r\nand forty miles further, on the same side, the considerable Pastaca,\r\nwhich originates also in the cordillera.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles below, the large Guallaga enters it, originating a\r\nlittle to the north of lake Chiquiacoba in 11° of latitude, in the\r\ndistrict of Huanaco, which name it takes for a considerable space,\r\ndescribing numerous small windings. After it follows the river\r\nChambyra, and then the Tigre, both flowing from the north-west, the\r\nlatter having a course of three hundred miles.\r\n\r\nSixty miles below the embouchure of the Tigre, is the magnificent\r\nconfluence of the Tanguragua, with the Ucayale. The Ucayale originates\r\nin the latitude of 18° south-east of the large lake Chucuito, otherwise\r\nTiticaca, and one hundred and twenty miles east-north-east of the city\r\nof Arica. It runs to the north and north-west, under the name of Benni,\r\nto its junction with the Apurimaco, in the latitude of 11°, where both\r\ntheir names are lost in that of the Ucayale.\r\n\r\nThe Apurimaco rises a few leagues north of the city of Arequipa,\r\nbetween the lake Chucuito and the Pacific Ocean, from which it is only\r\ndistant about fifty miles; and runs northward, describing considerable\r\nwindings, and gathering various other streams, amongst which the most\r\nimportant are the Pampas, on the left, in 13° 10′; the Urubamba, on\r\nthe right, in 12° 15′; and the Montaro in 12° 6′, where it changes the\r\ndirection towards the north-east. Previously to mingling its waters\r\nwith the Benni it receives on the left the Perene, and on the right,\r\nten miles above its mouth, the Pancartamba.\r\n\r\nThe Montaro issues from the lake Chinchayocha, in the district of\r\nHuanaco, in 11°, and flows for a considerable space to the south-east\r\nalong the cordillera, describing extensive windings to its embouchure.\r\n\r\nThe largest tributary of the Ucayale, after it takes this name, is\r\nthe Pachitea, which joins it on the left, in the latitude of 8° 30′,\r\nbeing more handsome in its appearance than considerable, its course not\r\nexceeding two hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe Maranham, at the confluence where it takes this name, directs its\r\ncourse to the north-east for one hundred miles, receiving, on the left,\r\nthe Napo, which originates in divers parts of the interior cordillera\r\nof the Andes, in the vicinity of Quito, from whence it flows to the\r\nsouth-east, collecting various others, and, after a course of five\r\nhundred and fifty miles, discharges itself by different channels,\r\nformed by several islands, above which it is twelve hundred yards in\r\nwidth.\r\n\r\nWith this river the Maranham becomes eighteen hundred yards wide, yet\r\nhaving acquired only a small portion of the volume of water with which\r\nit enters the ocean, from whence it is here distant thirteen hundred\r\nmiles in a direct line. At this part it inclines to the east, and,\r\nafter fifty miles of course, receives by the right the Cassiquin, which\r\ncomes from the south, with three hundred and fifty miles of extent.\r\n\r\nSeventy miles lower the Hyabary enters, which has its source in the\r\nterritories of the Torromonas in 11° 30′.\r\n\r\nUpwards of one hundred miles further is the mouth of the large Iça,\r\nwhich originates in the skirts of the said cordillera to the north-east\r\nof the Napo, and in the vicinity of St. Joam de Pasto, with the name of\r\nPutumajo.\r\n\r\nThe Hyutahy and the Hyurba follow; they are less than the preceding,\r\nbeing about three hundred and sixty fathoms in width, and next to the\r\nTeffe, the Coary, and the Purus, which are discharged by many mouths.\r\n\r\nOn the northern margin it receives the great river Hyapura, after an\r\nextensive course from the province of Popayan. This river runs parallel\r\nwith the Maranham for a considerable distance, discharging itself\r\nin that space by nine channels, the mouth of the first being three\r\nhundred miles to the west of the last. Auatiparana, Euiratyba, Manhana,\r\nUaranapu, Hyapura, Unana, Copeya, Hyucara, and Cadaya, are the names of\r\nthe channels, and the order by which the Hyapura enters the Maranham.\r\nThe Maranham is estimated to be nearly a mile and a half in width, at\r\na certain part, free from islands, about twenty miles below the Purus,\r\nwhere the bottom, it is said, could not be found with a cord of one\r\nhundred and three fathoms.\r\n\r\nAfter the Hyapura, its waters are swelled by the entrance, also on\r\nthe northern side of the Rio Negro, almost equalling it in width and\r\nvolume; and sixty miles lower, on the right, by the river Madeira,\r\nnearly two miles in width, being the most considerable of all the\r\nsubordinate torrents that fill up the vast space between the receding\r\nmargins of this wonderful river. The river Madeira was designated\r\nCayary, until the Portuguese gave it the former denomination, in\r\nconsequence of the large trunks of trees, some of cedar, of an\r\nextraordinary size, that floated down at the period of the floods,\r\nMadeira being the Portuguese word for wood or timber. It takes this\r\nname at the confluence of the Guapore with the Mam ore, which latter\r\nhas its source in the province of Potoze, traversing that of Santa\r\nCruz, and describing a vast semicircle by the east towards the north,\r\nbeing enlarged by numerous other currents, which join it on both sides\r\nto the said confluence, in latitude 10° 22′. One hundred and forty\r\nmiles above this point, in the parallel of 13°, it communicates with\r\nthe Benni, by the river Exaltacao, issuing from the lake Rogagualo,\r\nfrom which another of short extent flows to the Mamore.\r\n\r\nIn front of the angle of the confluence of the Mamore with the Guapore,\r\nthere is an island of rock, well adapted for the site of a fort, which\r\nwould command the entrance of both rivers. Upwards of nine hundred\r\nmiles is computed from this situation to the mouth of the Madeira.\r\nIn the space of the first two hundred the traveller encounters twelve\r\ncataracts, equally astonishing for their grandeur and extent. The\r\nattention is first arrested by that which has the same denomination\r\nas the river, and not far below the island of rock alluded to. Three\r\nof the falls are within the space of a mile and a half. The canoes\r\nadvancing up the river are unloaded and conveyed in this state,\r\nincluding the different points, for half a mile. The Misericordia next\r\nfollows, about two miles lower down, and the danger and labour of\r\npassing it depends upon the height or diminution of the waters of the\r\nriver. Proceeding along another interval of the same space, the four\r\ncataracts of Reibeirao meet the astonished eye within the distance of\r\nfour miles. Canoes are here for a considerable way dragged over land.\r\n\r\nTwelve miles further is the Figueira, otherwise Araras, formed by small\r\nislands and large stones, but of no considerable extent.\r\n\r\nUpwards of twenty miles further is the Pederneiras, where the river is\r\nthickly overspread with immense stones, obliging the cargoes of the\r\ncanoes to be carried on men’s shoulders for nearly half a mile.\r\n\r\nDescending ten miles more the Paredao is met with, where the course of\r\nthe river is contracted, and its waters precipitated among rocks for a\r\nshort space.\r\n\r\nThe Ties Irmaos (Three Brothers) is the next, about twenty miles\r\nfurther, formed by various falls, generally small, for the distance of\r\nnear a mile.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles lower is the Girau, where the river flows with great\r\nrapidity, separated among rocks and precipitated over five falls in a\r\nshort distance. The canoes are here also carried over land.\r\n\r\nFive miles further is the Caldeirao de Inferno, (the Infernal\r\nCauldron,) three miles in extent, forming, in a certain situation, a\r\nmost perilous whirlpool, which requires much vigilance and labour to\r\nthe navigator.\r\n\r\nEighteen miles beyond the preceding is the fall of Morinhos, so called\r\nfrom three small morros, or rocks, a short distance from the western\r\nmargin, covered with sarsaparilla.\r\n\r\nPassing an interval of twelve miles the interesting fall, denominated\r\nthe Salto do Theotonio is next presented for contemplation, being\r\nan accumulation of rugged rock, twenty-six feet in height, broken\r\ninto four parts, dividing the waters of the Madeira into as many\r\nchannels, each having the appearance of a large river. Parallel with\r\nthis majestic sluice a reef of rock extends from the eastern margin\r\nalmost to the western, impelling the volume of waters of three\r\nchannels into the fourth, the whole flowing with immense profundity\r\nand greater rapidity by this strait between the extremity of the reef\r\nand the river’s left bank. The canoes are dragged over land, with much\r\ndifficulty and labour, nearly half a mile.\r\n\r\nFive miles lower is the fall of St. Antonio, which the river passes by\r\nthree currents, formed by two small stony islands. This is the first\r\nwhich interrupts the navigation of the canoes proceeding upwards, and\r\nis situated in the latitude of 8° 48′.\r\n\r\nThree months is generally consumed by the navigators of this river in\r\nadvancing up from this fall to that of Guajirumirim in the Guapore.\r\n\r\nFrom the fall of St. Antonio to the embouchure of the Madeira there are\r\nmore than thirty islands, from three to ten miles in length, almost all\r\nof them covered with superb timber; those of a smaller size are much\r\nmore numerous, the largest is called Minas, which is ten miles long\r\nand three in width, and is sixty miles below the mouth of the river\r\nMarmellos.\r\n\r\nThe waters of Rio Negro and the Madeira increase the width of the\r\nMaranham to nearly four miles, and when there are parallel islands it\r\nis at some places eight, and at others much more.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred miles in a direct line, or three hundred by the\r\ncourse of the river, below the Madeira, is the mouth of the large river\r\nTapajos; and two hundred miles further to the east that of the river\r\nXingu, equal if not superior to the preceding; both coming from the\r\ndistrict of Cuiaba, and neither with less than eight hundred miles of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nAt the confluence of the latter the Amazons inclines to the north-east\r\nfor the distance of one hundred and forty miles, augmenting sensibly in\r\nwidth as it approaches the equator, where it discharges itself into the\r\nocean by a mouth of from twenty-five to thirty miles.\r\n\r\nEighty miles below the mouth of the Xingu there is a channel called\r\nTagypuru, in certain parts very narrow, and running towards the\r\nsouth-east as far as the mouth of the river Annapu, where it becomes\r\nupwards of fifteen miles in width, with many islands, and flows to\r\nthe east until it enters the river Tucantins, which comes from the\r\ncentre of the province of Goyaz, and at this part inclines to the\r\nnorth-east, increasing considerably in width, and entering the ocean\r\nby an embouchure equal to that of the Amazons, with this difference,\r\nthat for some leagues up it is impregnated with salt water, whilst the\r\nother carries its volume of pure waters many leagues into the sea,\r\nperfectly fresh, having acquired, by its rapidity and prodigious body,\r\na preponderating power over the first essays of its saline opponent\r\ntill the ocean buries it in fathomless depths.\r\n\r\nOn the northern margin of the Amazons, below the Rio Negro, are\r\ndischarged, among other smaller streams, the Matary, which flows\r\nfrom some handsome lakes; the Urubu, otherwise Barururu; the Aniba,\r\ndenominated sometimes Saraca; the Trombetas; the Gurupatuba; and the\r\nAnnarapucu.\r\n\r\nThe lateral lands of the Amazons from Borja, where the falls and\r\ncurrents terminate, are flat and covered with woods. The current is\r\nalways rapid, even at its greatest diminution, and the waters when\r\ndrawn are of an orange colour, and at the floods are never muddy. Its\r\nbed is an archipelago, leaving, in the space of above one thousand\r\nmiles, few places where the navigator can distinctly see both sides\r\nof the continent. These islands increase and decrease annually, not\r\nonly in number but in size at the period of the floods, which, in\r\nparts, divide one into two, and in others accumulate many into one by\r\nfilling up the channels which separated them. Here portions of land are\r\nviolently torn away from the continent, there from the islands, with\r\nwhich either the existing ones are augmented or new ones formed. Some\r\nare of great extent, and usually covered with large trees.\r\n\r\nThe vessels which are navigated to the high Amazons are formed of\r\ntrunks of trees of from forty to sixty feet in length; they are\r\nexcavated into the form of canoes, with the power of fire and water,\r\nand the greatest width is given that they are susceptible of; being\r\npreserved in this state with knees, to which are nailed planks to make\r\nthem higher, having around prow, and a poop with a cabin, and a rudder.\r\nThey always retain the appellation of canoes, and have two masts,\r\nwith round sails, in order to proceed up before an easterly wind, and\r\ndescend by the impulse of the current. It is dangerous to navigate near\r\nthe margins, where frequently large trees fall into the river without\r\nany wind, the current having excavated the ground upon which they stood.\r\n\r\nThe tide advances to the town of Obydos, more than five hundred miles\r\nabove Macappa, computing by the bed of the river. With a strong wind\r\nit swells like the sea, but immediately the wind subsides it becomes\r\ntranquil by the power of the current, which dissipates the advancing\r\nwaves in a moment.\r\n\r\nAmongst other species of fish with which it is stored are the\r\n_gorujuba_, the large _perahyba_, _doirado_, _pescada_, and _puraquez_,\r\nwhich possesses the property of benumbing the arm of the fisherman.\r\nA species of seal, denominated by the Indians _manahy_, and by the\r\nPortuguese _peixe-boy_, (ox fish, or sea calf,) in consequence of\r\nthe similarity of its snout or head to that animal, is the largest,\r\nand feeds upon herbs which grow upon the margins, without going out\r\nof the river. It is viviparous and gives milk to its young like the\r\nwhale, and has extremely small eyes; the flesh is like veal and of a\r\ngood flavour, of which is also made sausages, called _mixiras_; the oil\r\nextracted from it not only serves for lights but for seasoning various\r\neatables. The Dutch, when they had a footing in these parts, derived a\r\nlucrative branch of commerce from this fish. The _pirarucu_ is large,\r\nand esteemed good; its tongue serves the Indians for a rasp to grate\r\nthe guarana fruit; the internal parts, after being dried in the sun,\r\nform a good glue, and when reduced to powder exceed every thing for\r\nclarifying coffee. Alligators are numerous and very large; and the\r\ntortoise is very bulky and abundant, but its shell is of no value: it\r\nis amphibious, and deposits at one time more than a hundred eggs in\r\nholes which it makes in the sand at a short distance from the water,\r\ncovering them over; the heat of the sun hatches them, and the young,\r\ndisengaging themselves from the sand, immediately proceed to the river;\r\nmany, however, in this short march, are devoured by the hawk.\r\n\r\nThe river Moju, which is spacious and deep, even as far as the tide\r\nreaches, originates in the territory of the Camecran Indians beyond\r\nthe woods, which it afterwards traverses northward until it enters the\r\nbay of Guajara. In the forests or woods above mentioned, consisting\r\nof most excellent timber, and where the chestnut-tree of the country\r\nabounds, there is a great scarcity of game, caused, no doubt, by the\r\ncontinued huntings of the Ammanius, Pochetys, Appinages, and Norogages,\r\ntribes of Indians who dwell in the circumjacent country. The want of\r\nthis resource is the alleged reason for establishments not having been\r\nformed in the fertile territory watered by this river, navigable to its\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nThe Camecran Indians are divided into five hordes, distinguished by as\r\nmany pre-names, namely, Ma-camecran, Crore-camecran, Pore-camecran,\r\nCha-camecran, and Pio-camecran, the whole being very similar in their\r\nlanguage and customs. The Ma-camecrans live at present in a state of\r\npacific intermixture with the inhabitants of the new arraial of St.\r\nPedro d’Alcantara, belonging to the jurisdiction of Goyaz.\r\n\r\nForty miles above the mouth of the Moju there is a narrow, winding,\r\nand extensive strait, denominated Iguarapemirim, which is a channel\r\nof communication between this river and the Tucantins, thus forming\r\nan island of thirty-five miles from north to south, and twenty at its\r\ngreatest width. The Acara, also considerable, affords navigation to the\r\nagriculturists upon its adjacent lands, divided into various parishes,\r\nand loses its name on entering the Moju by the right, fifteen miles\r\nsouth of the capital. Six miles below this confluence the Moju is\r\nnearly a mile in width.\r\n\r\nThe river Guama, likewise considerable, comes from the east, traversing\r\na fertile country partially inhabited to its source, and is discharged\r\ninto the bay of Guajara, near the Moju, having received, near forty\r\nmiles above, the Capim on the left.\r\n\r\nThe largest island of this province is the Joannes, otherwise Marajo,\r\nsituated between the Tucantins and the Amazons, with the ocean on the\r\nnorth, and the strait of Tagypuru on the south. It extends ninety miles\r\nfrom north to south, and one hundred and twenty from east to west,\r\nis inhabited and watered by various rivers; abounding in cattle, and\r\nformerly had the title of a barony.\r\n\r\nIts principal rivers are the Anajaz, which issues from a lake, and has\r\na course, to the west, of fifty miles in a direct line. The Arary,\r\nsomething larger, flows from another lake, and discharges itself by two\r\nmouths on the eastern side the Mondin, which also runs to the east, and\r\nthe Atua to the south-east: the whole are navigable with the aid of the\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nThe Nhengahybas, principally masters of this island, and Christianized\r\nin part by the Jesuit Antonio Vieyra, were expert mariners, as well as\r\nothers living upon the adjacent rivers, and possessed a great number\r\nof canoes, denominated in their own language _igaras_, from which\r\nthey derived the appellation of Igaruanas; and always proceeding in\r\ncanoes, were distinguished by this name from tribes who lived in woods\r\ndistant from the water. Under the denomination of Igaruanas were\r\nalso comprehended the Tupinambas, the Mammayamas, the Guayanas, the\r\nJuruanas, the Pacayas, and others. They had small _igaras_ for\r\nfishing and proceeding from one neighbouring place to another; but\r\ntheir war _igaras_ were forty and fifty feet long, of one trunk,\r\nexcavated with stone axes and fire, and were called _maracatims_,\r\nfrom _maraca_, the name of a certain instrument made of a gourd,\r\nwith stones or dried legumes within; and _tim_, which properly\r\nsignifies the nose, but translated to imply the beak of a bird, and\r\neven the prow of the vessel, in consequence of these canoes having at\r\nthe head a large _vara_, or pole, in the form of a bowsprit, to\r\nwhich the _maracas_ were suspended with small cords, clashing\r\ntogether with a loud rattling noise equally warlike and terrific. Their\r\nbattles were fatal, and decided with the arrow, spear, and club.\r\n\r\nThe Igaruanas of the lower Amazons were esteemed the very best of\r\nrowers, when they were habituated to it from their infancy. It was they\r\nwho, by the force of the oar, conducted the fleet of Captain Pedro\r\nTeyxeira from the bay of Guajara to the sight of the Andes.\r\n\r\nWith four very large rivers, the Tucantins, the Zingu, the Tapajos,\r\nand the Madeira, nature has partitioned this province into as many\r\ndistricts, which it is probable in a short period will form an equal\r\nnumber of comarcas; and, for the disembarrassment of their history and\r\ngeography, we will describe them as so divided, namely:\r\n\r\n    DISTRICTS.

It is four hundred and fifty miles\r\nfrom north to south, and two hundred from east to west, the country\r\nbeing flat, watered with many rivers, and possessing immense woods,\r\ndemonstrating the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe before-described rivers Guama, Acara, and Maju, are the principal\r\nones of this district, well enough provided with ports, and exceeding\r\nthe others in population and agriculture. The southern part is yet\r\noccupied by wild Indians. The tribe Taramambazes, who were masters of\r\nthe sea coast from the bay of Turyassu to that of Cahete, excelled all\r\nothers in the art of swimming. They could swim leagues, and frequently\r\nproceeded by night to cut the cables of ships anchored at a distance,\r\nremaining an extraordinary time under water.\r\n\r\nBELEM, more generally called PARA, is the capital of the province,\r\nsituated upon the eastern margin of the river Tucantins in the bay\r\nof Guajara, at the northern angle of the embouchure of the Guama,\r\nfronting the island of Oncas, and in a plain eighty miles from the\r\nocean. It is an episcopal city, in a state of mediocrity, with a\r\npopulation now only of about twenty thousand, many having been recently\r\nswept off by the small-pox. If the access to it was better it would\r\nbecome more rapidly commercial. It is ornamented with many chapels, a\r\nconvent of Capuchins, another of slippered Carmelites, a misericordia,\r\nand a hospital. The cathedral and the palace of the governors are\r\nhandsome edifices. The streets are straight, the principal ones paved,\r\nand the houses mainly of stone. The convent of Mercenarios, who are\r\nextinct, is at present the quarters of a regiment. The ci-devant\r\nJesuitical college is converted into a seminary, and the episcopal\r\npalace and the church serve for the misericordia. It has a tribunal\r\nda Fazenda-real, similar to the other capitals of provinces, a port\r\nadmiral, an ouvidor, a Juiz do Fora, and royal professors of Latin,\r\nrhetoric, and philosophy. Since the arrival of the Royal Family in the\r\nBrazil, botanical gardens have been established in the vicinity of the\r\nfew maritime towns of note; and this city can boast of one, having a\r\nvariety of the most useful and best trees of the province, likewise\r\nsome European trees. There is an arsenal with its chapel, and many\r\nengenhos for rice.\r\n\r\nAt the request of John V. Pope Clement XI. despatched a Bull for\r\nthe creation of this bishopric in 1719, and none of the Brazilian\r\ncathedrals originated with so much splendour, and attendants of\r\narchdeacons, canons, deacons, &c. &c. It is divided into two parishes,\r\nSt. Maria da Graca, and St. Anna, amongst whose inhabitants there are\r\ncomparatively few negroes.\r\n\r\nThe port in which the tide rises eleven feet is considered to be\r\ndiminishing in depth. Thunder is very frequent, but not diurnal, as\r\nhas been stated; the showers which accompany it mitigate, in some\r\ndegree, the ardent heat which universally prevails. The land breezes,\r\nas well as those from the sea, generally every evening moderate the\r\nburning rays of the sun, which may be said to be almost vertical, and\r\nrefresh the atmosphere; thereby rendering this place very healthy,\r\nand tolerably free from the endemical diseases which many regions are\r\nsubject to in a similar latitude. There are few insects that introduce\r\nthemselves into the human frame, or that are so troublesome as in some\r\nof the other provinces. The days and nights are equal nearly the whole\r\nyear. The environs of this city were formerly very unwholesome, but an\r\nevident improvement took place after the colonists began to clear away\r\nthe woods, and cattle to increase.\r\n\r\nThe exportations from hence are cocoa, coffee, rice, cotton,\r\nsarsaparilla, the Maranham and Molluca clove, raw and tanned hides,\r\n_pechurim_ or _pucheri_, _cupahyba_ or _capivi_, _tapioca_, gum,\r\nthe urucu die, molasses, Indian rubber, castanhas, or chestnuts of\r\nMaranham, timber, &c. These articles were formerly sent to Maranham,\r\nand the trade with this place was carried on through the medium of\r\ncoasting vessels; but the honourable ambition and activity of the\r\nEnglish merchant, which lead him to every corner of the globe for the\r\npurposes of commerce, did not allow this place long to escape his\r\nobservation, and one or two establishments were formed here soon after\r\nthe arrival of the Royal Family, which have increased to five or six.\r\nThe Confiance British sloop of war first navigated up to the town,\r\ndemonstrating that vessels, not drawing more water, might accomplish\r\nthe same object; and a house at Glasgow subsequently employed two\r\nvessels of much larger burthen in the trade of this city, for whose\r\npresent commerce, however, vessels of a smaller class are better\r\nadapted. The spontaneous productions, abundant fertility, and extent\r\nof the province, fully justify the expectation of its becoming a very\r\nconsiderable place; and more particularly so from the probability of\r\nits being, at no distant period, the only mart for the increasing\r\nproductions of the provinces of Goyaz and Matto-grosso.\r\n\r\nIts cottons have some time held a rank in the British market and\r\nobtained a price not far short of the Bahia cottons; the communication\r\nis principally with Liverpool, and from ten to fifteen small brigs\r\nproceed from thence to Para annually with English manufactures, and\r\nreturn with produce. One or two vessels also from London have recently\r\nmaintained with it a regular intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe great extent of country comprising the province of Para, as well\r\nas the tributary provinces of Solimoes and Guianna, coming mainly\r\nunder the jurisdiction of its governors, have induced the government\r\ngenerally to appoint individuals of distinguished families and noble\r\nbirth to this situation. The present governor of this very important\r\ndistrict, extending almost to the Oronocos, is the Conde de Villa\r\nFlora. Two miles to the north-east is situated a chapel of Our Lady of\r\nNazareth, frequently visited by the inhabitants of this city.\r\n\r\nPara was the first town in the Brazil that adopted the new constitution\r\nof Portugal, which event, highly to its honour, was brought about\r\nwithout any bloodshed, in the beginning of January, 1821.\r\n\r\nBraganca, formerly Cayte, and the capital of a small capitania so\r\ncalled, is one of the best and most ancient towns of the province,\r\nand is ornamented with some hermitages. It is well situated on the\r\nleft margin of the river from which it derived its primitive name,\r\nand is about twenty miles from the ocean, and near one hundred to the\r\neast-north-east of the capital, and seventy to the east-south-east\r\nof Point Tigioca. An extensive bridge traverses a swamp, or marsh,\r\nand divides it into two parts; the northern division was at first\r\nonly inhabited by Indians. It is a port or calling place for the\r\ncoasting-vessels that navigate from Maranham to Para. Its church is\r\ndedicated to St. Joam Baptista.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles to the east-south-east of Braganca, and the same\r\ndistance from the sea, is the parish of St. Joze de Cerzedello, upon\r\nthe right margin of a small river. Thirty miles to the south-south-west\r\nof Braganca, and eighty to the east of the capital, is the small town\r\nof Ourem, upon the right bank of the Guama. It is ornamented with a\r\nchurch dedicated to the Espirito Santo, and its inhabitants cultivate\r\nthe necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nVigia, an ancient town, and for some time considerable and flourishing\r\nwhilst the depository of a great quantity of cocoa and coffee, brought\r\nthither from the adjacent country, is fifty miles north-north-east of\r\nthe capital, upon the margin of the Para or Tucantins. The Jesuits\r\nhad a college here, and the Mercenaries an entertaining-house.\r\nIts primitive and proper name is St. Jorge dos Alamos. The church\r\nis dedicated to Our Lady of Nazareth, and the inhabitants are\r\nagriculturists and fishermen.\r\n\r\nCintra is a small town, fifty miles west-north-west of Braganca,\r\nseventy north-east of Para, and fifteen east of Villa Nova, pleasantly\r\nsituated at the mouth of the river Maracana, of which it formerly had\r\nthe name. Its surrounding country is appropriated to various branches\r\nof agriculture; the church is dedicated to the Archangel St. Miguel,\r\nand its inhabitants, who are diminishing, cultivate little more than\r\nthe necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity, and north-east of Cintra, is the aldeia of Salinas,\r\nwith some regularity, and in a very agreeable district, having a place\r\nof worship dedicated to Nossa Senhora do Socorro.\r\n\r\nCollares, formerly a middling town, and well supplied, is forty miles\r\nnorth-north-east of the capital, upon an island six miles in length\r\nfrom north to south, with proportionable width, and separated from the\r\ncontinent by a narrow strait. It has only one church of the Lady of\r\nRozario, and its environs are partially appropriated to the production\r\nof coffee, cocoa, and the necessaries of life common to the country.\r\n\r\nTwelve miles south-south-east of Point Tigioca, and sixty north-east\r\nof the capital, is Villa Nova d’el Rey, upon the margin, and a very\r\nlittle above the embouchure of the Curuca, at the bottom of a bay. Its\r\ninhabitants, for the main part Indians, are fishermen, and cultivators\r\nof mandioca, Indian corn, rice, cocoa, and coffee, which do not remove\r\nthem from a state of poverty, although the soil is of great fertility,\r\nand worthy of a more active and industrious population. It has a church\r\nof Our Lady of Rozario.\r\n\r\nGurupy, advantageously situated upon the banks of the bay of the same\r\nname, was created a town in 1671, and became for some time rather\r\nflourishing, whilst the capital of a small Capitania, and visited by\r\nthe coasting-vessels from Maranham to Para. Its anchorage-place has\r\ndiminished in depth, and agriculture is declining from the want of\r\nwhites as well as Africans.\r\n\r\nBayao, a small Indian town, with some whites on the eastern margin of\r\nthe Tucantins, and thirty-five miles above Cameta, is well supplied\r\nwith fish, and the rendezvous of canoes from Goyaz. It has a church\r\nof St. Antonio, and the inhabitants cultivate cocoa, coffee, cotton,\r\nrice, mandioca, divers fruits, and hortulans. Its very advantageous\r\nsituation, and the wide field for agricultural improvement, promise it\r\na considerable augmentation.\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles further, upon the same margin of the Tucantins, and\r\neighteen below the fort of Alcobaca, is the aldeia of Pederneira,\r\ninhabited by christianized Indians, who cultivate the same articles as\r\nthe preceding town. Here the river begins to be thickly strewed with\r\nislands to the capital. In this district there is yet the small town of\r\nConde upon the margin of the Tucantins, twenty miles to the south-west\r\nof Para; also Beja, a place of the same order, and seven miles south of\r\nConde; and Abayte, an insignificant place, eight miles south of Beja;\r\nall three are upon an island formed by the rivers Tucantins, Muju, and\r\nIgarape Mirim, whose territory is appropriated to several branches of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nArcos, situated upon the great bay of Turyvassu, is an aboriginal\r\ntown, and the insufficiency of its inhabitants retards the progress\r\nof agriculture, to which its fertile soil is so favourable. Upon\r\nthis coast, also, are the parishes of St. Joze de Piria, and Vizeu,\r\ninhabited by Indians; and in the adjacent lands of the river Guamma are\r\nthose of Caraparu, Bujaru, Anhangapy, Irituya, St. Miguel da Cachoeira,\r\nand St. Domingos, in the angle of the mouth of the river Capim.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _District of_ XINGUTANIA.\r\n\r\nThis district is of a quadrangular form, and is bounded on the north\r\nby the river Amazons, on the west by the river Xingu, which affords\r\nit the name, and separates it from Tapajonia; on the south by the\r\ndistrict of Tapiraquia, and on the east by the Tucantins. It is a\r\nportion of the province yet little known, and almost wholly inhabited\r\nby the posterity of the Aborigines, divided into various nations. The\r\nmost northern tribes have some intercourse with the Christians of the\r\npovaoçoes, situated upon the margins of the rivers which limit the\r\ndistrict, and various individuals of them have embraced Christianity.\r\nThe lands which have been cultivated are fertile, and appropriated\r\nto a great variety of hortulans, edible roots, Indian corn, rice,\r\n_feijao_, tobacco, cotton, the sugar cane, and all the fruit trees\r\nof the climate.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa shrub, or tree, grows spontaneously in various situations.\r\nIn the vicinities of the rivers the aspect of the woods is rendered\r\nagreeable by the diversity and thickness of the trees. They are stored\r\nwith birds and game, which are alike the resource of the indolent\r\nsavages and the Christians, who hitherto have not introduced the breed\r\nof cattle.\r\n\r\nLittle is yet known relative to the mineralogy of this province, nor\r\nof the genius or customs of the central and southern hordes of the\r\nnatives. A great number of rivers, many of crystaline waters, flow from\r\nthe centre of this comarca into those which mainly surround it.\r\n\r\nThe Annapu traverses the country from south to north, and discharges\r\nitself in front of the island of Marajo by various mouths; the\r\nprincipal one is spacious, and forms a great bay within. After many\r\ndays’ voyage up this river, falls are met with, and its bed is strewed\r\nwith large stones. In the woods which border it there are abundance of\r\nclove-trees of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Pacajaz, properly Pacaya, has an extensive course through a stony\r\nbed, and over many considerable falls, at certain distances. Four days’\r\nvoyage is required to arrive at the bar of the great river Iriuanna,\r\nwhich unites it on the eastern bank, and a few leagues above the\r\nembouchure is the entrance of the channel, which connects it with the\r\nAnnapu. It runs east of the Annapu, and takes the name of a nation\r\nwhich occupies its adjacent territory, where there is great abundance\r\nof clove-trees.\r\n\r\nThe river Jacundaz, or Hyacunda, is very large, affording an extensive\r\nnavigation, and discharges itself east of the Pacaya. The Araticu\r\nempties itself east of the Hyacunda by a wide channel, which bathes the\r\nisland of Marago, on the south.\r\n\r\nThe Areas, which runs into the Amazons, near the northern entrance\r\nof the Tagypuru Strait, is navigable for a considerable distance,\r\ntraversing woods, growing upon extensive plains, and abounding with a\r\nvariety of game.\r\n\r\nThe Tacanhunas, so denominated from the tribe of Indians whose\r\nterritory it irrigates, enters the Tucantins, near the Itaboca.\r\n\r\nVilla Vicoza, originally called Cameta, and one of the most ancient\r\ntowns of the province, is flourishing, and well situated upon the left\r\nmargin of the Tucantins, ninety miles south-west of the capital, and is\r\na port for the canoes navigating towards Goyaz and the High Maranham,\r\nas well as a depository for various productions cultivated within its\r\nfertile district. It has a church dedicated to St. Joam Baptista, and\r\nwas for some time the capital of a small capitania known by the same\r\nname. The Tucantins is here ten miles in width, being an archipelago.\r\nFifteen miles to the north-east, which is the direction it takes from\r\nthis town to the ocean, is the island of Ararahy, or Aragacy, ten miles\r\nin length, narrow and flat, dividing the river into two currents, the\r\neastern one improperly called the bay of Marapata, and the western the\r\nbay of Limoeira.\r\n\r\nA short distance from the southern point of the island of Ararahy, on\r\nthe eastern bank of the Tucantins, is the southern entrance of the\r\nbefore-mentioned Igarape Mirim, (Narrow Strait,) and in front of it,\r\non the opposite margin, another, called the Furo do Japim, which is\r\nextensive, and flows into the large channel that waters the southern\r\ncoast of Marajo.\r\n\r\nEighty miles, by water, above Villavicoza, upon the same margin of the\r\nTucantins, is the fort of Alcobaca, for the purpose of registering\r\nthe canoes from Goyaz; and three miles further there is another,\r\ndenominated Arroyos, for the same object: here the tide is occasionally\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nGurupu is a small town, with a church of St. Antonio upon the banks\r\nof the Amazons, twenty-five miles below the mouth of the Zingu. Some\r\nearthen ware is here made, and tiles and bricks are exported to\r\ndifferent parts, constituting a branch of its commerce, besides cocoa\r\nand cloves. From hence is distinguished, far to the north, the serra\r\nof Velha, almost always enveloped in mist, and beyond it the serra of\r\nParu, upon whose summits the electric fluid finds a vehicle in airy\r\nvapour, giving them additional grandeur by the vibrating thunder-peels\r\nthat strike upon the distant ear. They are both of considerable\r\naltitude, and the only mountains which the navigator sees from Para to\r\nthe city of Borja.\r\n\r\nMelgaco, a town in a state of mediocrity, abounding with fish, is\r\nsituated upon the western side of lake Annapu, and watered by the\r\nriver of that name, fifteen miles above its embouchure. Its church is\r\ndedicated to St. Michael, and the inhabitants cultivate vegetables,\r\ngrain, &c. peculiar to the country, and extract many articles of\r\ncommerce from the woods.\r\n\r\nPortel, a small town, is situated on the eastern side of the lake\r\nAnnapu, near the embouchure of the channel that connects it with\r\nthe river Pacaya, seven miles south of Melgaco. It has a church of\r\nSt. Miguel, and the inhabitants, almost all Indians, are fishermen,\r\nhunters, and agriculturists.\r\n\r\nOeyras is a small town, in a sandy situation, upon the margin and\r\nfive miles above the mouth of the Araticu, forty miles north east\r\nof Villavicoza and thirty-five east of Melgaco. It has a church of\r\nAssumpçao, and its people are composed of Indians of various nations,\r\nwho cultivate the most common necessaries, and indulge in their\r\nfavourite habits of hunting and fishing.\r\n\r\nBetween the last river and the Panauha originated the Aldeia dos Bocas,\r\nso denominated from the Combocas, who were its first inhabitants, and\r\nfrom whom also the Bahia dos Bocas derived its name, being a large bay,\r\nextending westward to the bar of the Panauha, that disembogues near the\r\nsouthern entrance of the Tagypuru Strait.\r\n\r\nPorto de Moz is a middling and well supplied town, upon the eastern\r\nmargin of the Xingu, (which is here very wide,) twelve miles from the\r\nAmazons and the port of canoes that navigate these rivers. It has a\r\nchurch dedicated to St. Braz, and the inhabitants are Indian farmers,\r\nand collect some exports.\r\n\r\nVeyros is a small town, well situated upon the Xingu, fifty miles from\r\nPorto de Moz, near the mouth of a small current, having a church of St.\r\nJohn Baptista, and Indian inhabitants of various nations, who produce a\r\nsufficiency of common necessaries, and some articles of trade.\r\n\r\nPombal is another Indian town, and of the same class as the preceding,\r\nbut only requiring the addition of a certain number of whites and\r\nnegroes to render it considerable and flourishing, in consequence\r\nof the uncommon fertility of its soil, and the valuable productions\r\nwith which nature has enriched it, having, besides, great facility of\r\nexportation. It is eighteen miles above Veyros, upon the Xingu, which\r\nsupplies it abundantly with fish.\r\n\r\nThe island of Marajo, in consequence of its proximity, may be\r\nconsidered as forming a part of this district. Its principal povoaçoes\r\nare the following:--\r\n\r\nMonforte, _ci-devant_ Villa de Joannes, a middling town, and\r\nwell situated upon the bay of Marajo, has a church of Nossa Senhora\r\ndo Rozario, and is nearly fifty miles north of Para. A Juiz de Fora\r\npresides over the senate, and it may be regarded as the capital of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nMoncaraz, originally Cayha, is a small town, with a church of St.\r\nFrancisco d’Assiz, and ten miles south of Monforte, at the embouchure\r\nof a small river in front of Collares.\r\n\r\nSalvaterra is an insignificant place, but well situated upon the\r\nsouthern angle of the month of the Mondin, eight miles north of\r\nMonforte, and has a church of the Lady of Conceiçao.\r\n\r\nSoyre, a villota, or small village, is situated upon the northern batik\r\nof the Mondin, a few miles above Salvaterra, with a church of Menino\r\nDeus.\r\n\r\nChaves is a small town upon the northern coast, fronting Robordello,\r\nand flourished whilst a fishery existed, which was there established by\r\na company from Para.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Chaves is the parish of Condexa, also a maritime\r\npovoaçao, refreshed with fine breezes, but possessing nothing\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nIn this island are also the parishes of Porto Salvo, at the mouth of\r\nthe river Marajo Assu, in front of the town of Conde, Ponte de Pedra,\r\nmore to the north, and Villar, a little further in the same direction.\r\nThey are inhabited by Indians, who cultivate the provisions of the\r\nclimate, and practise hunting and fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _District of_ TAPAJONIA.\r\n\r\nThis district is confined on the north by the Amazons; on the south by\r\nthe district of Arinos; on the west by that of Mundrucania, from which\r\nit is separated by the Tapajos, the river that affords the district\r\nits name; and on the east by Xingutania. It is three hundred and fifty\r\nmiles in length from north to south, and about two hundred of medium\r\nwidth.\r\n\r\nThe Xingu being the only one of the larger class of rivers in the\r\nBrazil that has not been navigated to its heads, no authentic account\r\nis furnished of the aspect of the eastern part of this district from a\r\ncertain situation upwards.\r\n\r\nThe navigators of the Tapagos have observed numerous small hills and\r\nsome mountains at a considerable distance from the Amazons, in whose\r\nvicinity the lands are flat, and no considerable river flows from this\r\ndistrict into the first, which is itself wide, and full of islands of\r\nvarious sizes, overspread with woods.\r\n\r\nThe river Zingu, forming the eastern limit of this district, is\r\nvery wide, and is only found, after eight days’ voyage, to have any\r\nfalls, demonstrating the gradual elevation of the country towards the\r\ninterior. The first considerable confluent joining it on the Western\r\nside is the Guiriri, which rises in the centre of the district of\r\nArinos: a good distance below this confluence it describes two large\r\nand opposite semicircular windings, flowing amongst small eminences.\r\n\r\nNo large river runs from this district to the Amazons, excepting the\r\nCurua, which has an extensive course, and passes the considerable\r\nlake of the same name, where it is augmented by the waters of several\r\nstreams that are there discharged. Its mouth is thirty miles below the\r\nTapajos, and canoes advance up as far as the said lake, whose margins\r\nabound in different sorts of birds, that subsist on shell fish. The\r\nUruara, after a short course, is discharged by two mouths below the\r\nCurua.\r\n\r\nThe Guajara, also of short extent, traverses a very flat territory,\r\nwhere it is divided into various channels, emptying itself by six\r\nmouths, generally small, below the Uruara.\r\n\r\nThe Uraucu, otherwise Hyuraucu, having a communication with the\r\nGuajara, enters the Amazons above the Zingu, with which it also\r\ncommunicates in three places.\r\n\r\nIt is not ascertained yet whether there are mines of any ores in the\r\nsouthern part of this district.\r\n\r\nVarious aboriginal nations, it is much to be regretted, hitherto occupy\r\nthis fine district, even to the immediate vicinity of the Portuguese\r\nestablishments, which do not extend beyond the margins of the rivers\r\nthat limit it, and whose adjacent territories are thickly covered with\r\nmajestic woods of trees, whose stems are of immense span and height,\r\nthe soil being of admirable substance and fertility, and well suited\r\nto every branch of agriculture. Nature here produces spontaneously the\r\nclove, _cupahyba_, (or _capivi_,) _pechurim_, and cocoa trees, with\r\nsarsaparilla, ipecacuanha, jalap, and other medicinal drugs. Amongst\r\nother nations who possessed the adjacent lands of the Tapajos, and were\r\ndispersed by the Mundrucus, were the Hyauains, of whom nothing is known\r\nat the present day.\r\n\r\nSouzel is a middling town, situated in the skirts of a mount, bordering\r\nthe Zingu, which is the best supplier of water to its inhabitants,\r\nmostly Indians, who are occupied in hunting, fishing, and the\r\ncultivation of different articles. It is one hundred and ten miles\r\ndistant from the Amazons, has an earthenware manufactory, and may\r\nbecome more considerable with the increase of whites, and when the\r\nnavigation of the river is extended to the districts of Sappiraquia and\r\nArinos.\r\n\r\nSantarem, a large and flourishing town, situated within the embouchure\r\nof the river Tapajos, is the port or calling-place of canoes that\r\nnavigate towards Matto-Grosso and the high Amazons, and also the\r\ndepository of a great quantity of cocoa, whose trees have been\r\ncarefully cultivated in the surrounding-country, the soil being well\r\nadapted for them.\r\n\r\nIts beginning was an aldeia with the name of the river, and founded\r\nby the Jesuits for the habitation of an Indian horde. It has a church\r\nof Nossa Senhora da Conceiçao, and many houses of one story. The\r\nfort, which first defended it against the Indians, is now occupied by\r\na detachment for registering the canoes that ascend and descend both\r\nrivers. The inhabitants, principally whites, do not yet breed many\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nAlter do Cham, originally Hybirarybe, is yet a small town, but\r\nadvantageously situated upon a lake, near the Tapajos, (with which it\r\ncommunicates,) almost in the skirts of a rock, rising pyramidically to\r\na considerable height, and ten miles south of Santaram. Its inhabitants\r\nare principally Indians, and, besides the usual necessaries, cultivate\r\nsome excellent cocoa; but hunting and fishing are their favourite\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nAveyro, situated upon the margin of the Tapajos, has the title of a\r\ntown, but is only an inferior village, its houses being thatched with\r\nstraw, and disposed without regularity, in a beautiful situation. The\r\ninhabitants are Indians, and incapable of improving it; consequently\r\nthe advantages of being upon a navigable river, and in the midst of a\r\nrich and fertile soil, will not be available until it obtains a supply\r\nof white people. It is about sixty miles distant from Alter do Cham.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _District of_ MUNDRUCANIA.\r\n\r\nThis district, limited on the south by that of Juruenna, has on the\r\nnorth the river Amazons, on the west the river Madeira, and on the east\r\nthe river Tapajos. Its length from north to south, on the eastern side,\r\nis near three hundred miles, and its medium width two hundred. Along\r\nthe banks of the rivers which limit it, the country is mainly swampy,\r\nwith extensive morasses, inhabited by a profusion of birds, drawn\r\nthither by the shell fish. The intervals and the interior are covered\r\nwith widely-extending woods, possessing trees of every magnitude. The\r\nbanks of the rivers and lakes afford a species of cane, upon which the\r\nox-fish and tortoise feed. In some parts the granite-stone is common;\r\nbut there are no accounts of ore having been discovered any where in\r\nthis district.\r\n\r\nAmongst other small rivers which run into the Madeira, are the\r\nAnhangating, the mouth of which is in 5° 30′; the Mataura, which\r\nempties itself twenty miles lower down, and communicates with the\r\nCanoma in the interior of the district; and the Marmellos, originally\r\nAraxia, whose mouth is seven miles above the entrance to the lake\r\nMarucutuba.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the district is watered by the rivers Canoma,\r\nAbacachy, Apiuquiribo, Mauhe-Guassu, Mauhe-Mirim, Massary, Andira,\r\nTuppynambarana, all of which run into a branch of the Madeira, which,\r\nunder the name of Canoma, frequently denominated the Furo, or fury of\r\nthe Tuppynambaranas, describes many windings, traversing some lakes\r\nuntil it enters the Amazons by a spacious embouchure, called the river\r\nMauhes, which is one hundred and fifty miles below the principal mouth\r\nof the Madeira.\r\n\r\nThe Mauhes, so called from the Mauhe nation inhabiting its banks, has\r\nacquired also the appellation of the river of the Nambaranas, derived\r\nfrom a village or aldeia of the Tuppynambas, which existed near the\r\neastern margins of the lake Uaycurapa, and thirty miles above its mouth.\r\n\r\nIn the space of forty miles from the Furo dos Tuppynambaranas to the\r\ntown of Borbai there are the following lakes: Annamaha, Guarybas,\r\nCauhintu, Taboca, Frechal, Macacos, and Jatuaranna, all in the\r\nproximity of the river, into which their superfluous waters are\r\ndischarged. Forty miles above the said town is the entrance to the lake\r\nMattary, and beyond it that of the lake Murucutuba.\r\n\r\nBetween the Furo dos Tuppynambaranas and the mouth of the Madeira, is\r\nthe outlet of the lake Massurany. The domestic animals of this district\r\nare at present very inconsiderable; but the wild ones peculiar to the\r\nother comarcas are met with in much greater numbers, in consequence\r\nof the gun not having been yet so much introduced. With the exception\r\nof some portions of territory upon the banks of the rivers which\r\nencompass this district, the whole is in the power of various savage\r\ntribes, of whom, we are best acquainted with the Jummas, the Mauhes,\r\nthe Pammas, the Parintintins, the Muras, the Andiras, the Araras,\r\nand the Mundrucus, from which latter the district borrows its name.\r\nEach has its peculiar idiom, and the whole are divided into hordes;\r\nof which some wander about the woods and forests without any fixed\r\nresidence: others are established in aldeias, where they intermix with\r\nthe Christians, and have learned to cultivate various necessaries of\r\nlife. So far are some of them influenced by the power of example, that\r\nthey begin to cover, in part, their naked bodies; and many demonstrate\r\ntheir knowledge of the advantage of friendship with the Christians, by\r\nsubduing their native ferocity into a tractable observance of the rules\r\nof the white settlers.\r\n\r\nThe bow is the weapon common to the male sex, of whatever age\r\nthey may be: many possess another still more fatal, denominated\r\n_esgaravatana_; it is a reed of chosen wood, with ten to twelve\r\npalms of length, formed of two pieces glued together with wax, and\r\nfirmly bound with thongs made of the bark of plants, whose perfect and\r\nequally round orifice has eight lines of diameter, and serves for the\r\nenvenomed arrows, which are discharged by a puff of the breath. These\r\narrows are not more than a span, and have at the posterior extremity a\r\nball of cotton, equal to the eighth part of the _esgaravatana_.\r\nWhen they wish to discharge it, (which is said to be very certain, and\r\nas swift as the shot of a carbine,) the point is dipped in a thick\r\nfluid, composed of the juices of various poisonous plants. Some say\r\nthat sugar is the only antidote, others that salt will destroy its\r\nfatal effects, and that the wound is not mortal if the poison was dry\r\non contaminating the blood; and it is on this account that they carry\r\nthe venom in a cocoa-nut shell, or gourd, in order to introduce the\r\narrow into it at the moment of discharge. Condamine says, that on\r\nwounding a fowl with an arrow that had been envenomed twelve months\r\npreviously with a composition made by the Ticunas of Peru, it only\r\nlived about eight minutes; but there was probably some ingredient in\r\nthis poison that the Indians we have been speaking of are unacquainted\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe Jummas also wield a club, barbed at the extremity.\r\n\r\nThe Araras, who are the most celebrated for making ornaments of\r\nfeathers, form a black circle round the mouth, and perforate the\r\ncartilage of the nose, through which they put a small piece of wood,\r\ntrimmed with plumes of various colours.\r\n\r\nThe Parintintins distend the ears very much with round targets, and\r\nblacken the upper lip into a half moon form, conceiving that their\r\nconsequence is thus augmented.\r\n\r\nThe Muras, perhaps the most numerous among those who have had\r\nintercourse with the Portuguese, are the most backward in adopting any\r\nspecies of covering for their bodies, the main portion of both sexes\r\nyet appearing in a state of absolute nudity. The men not only ornament\r\ntheir arms and legs, but likewise perforate the nose, ears, and lips,\r\nand attach to them pendants of shells, the teeth of the boar, and of\r\nother wild quadrupeds. Many of them design various figures upon the\r\nskin, not without considerable suffering and much time; others disguise\r\nthe body with dies, and even with clay and loam, adopting this mode of\r\ndeforming themselves not so much perhaps with an idea of giving beauty\r\nto their persons as that they may thus assume an imposing air, in order\r\nto deter their enemies by their uncouth appearance. The women are\r\nmuch attached to their offspring whilst little, and row in the canoes\r\nequally with the men, of whom a great many have beards. The superiors\r\nhave many wives; others but one: they separate from them, however, at\r\ntheir caprice or discretion, and take others. _Tuxauha_ is the\r\ntitle given to the chiefs of the Mura tribe.\r\n\r\nThe Mundrucus, whose custom is to paint the body black with the die\r\nof Jenipapo, are numerous and powerful warriors, and the dread of all\r\nthe other nations, who give them the appellation of _Payquice_,\r\nwhich signifies _cut off the head_, in consequence of their savage\r\ncustom of cutting off the heads of all their enemies who fall into\r\ntheir power; and they know how to embalm them in such a manner that\r\nthey retain for many years the same aspect they had when severed from\r\nthe body. They ornament their rude and miserable cabanas with these\r\nhorrible trophies: he that can exhibit ten is eligible to the rank\r\nof chief of the horde. They are well acquainted with the virtues of\r\nvarious vegetables, with which they cure some dangerous diseases.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the Mundrucana tribes are at the present time allies of\r\nthe Portuguese, and some are Christianized. The brutal inhumanity at\r\npresent of those who rove in the woods, not giving quarter either to\r\nage or sex, has compelled the principal part of the other nations to\r\nseek for refuge near the povoaçoes of the Portuguese, under whose\r\nprotection they live secure from the attacks of their ferocious enemy.\r\n\r\nVilla Franca, originally Camaru, is a middling town, with some\r\nregularity, upon a lake, which communicates with the Amazons and with\r\nthe Tapajos, from whose margin it is not far distant. It is fifteen\r\nmiles south-west of Santarem. The church is dedicated to the Assumpçao\r\nof Nossa Senhora; and the inhabitants are mostly Indians, cultivating\r\ncocoa besides the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nVillanova da Raynha is a town of a similar kind, near the mouth of the\r\nMauhes, in an advantageous situation for increasing. Almost all its\r\ninhabitants are Mauhe Indians, who produce the best _guarana_,\r\nwhich is a composition made from the fruit of a shrub so called,\r\nand common in their territory. After being pounded, it is made into\r\nrolls like chocolate, and becomes quite hard: they attribute various\r\nbeneficial effects to the use of it; the most certain, however, is\r\ndriving away sleep!\r\n\r\nBorba is a small town, with wretched houses, well situated upon\r\nelevated ground on the right margin of the Madeira, eighty miles from\r\nthe Amazons and forty above the Furo dos Tuppynambaranas, and is a\r\ncalling-place for those who navigate towards Matto-Grosso. The church\r\nis of St. Antonio, and its population is descended from the aborigines\r\nof various nations, with a few Europeans and Mesticos, also some\r\nnegroes. Besides the common productions they cultivate some tobacco\r\nand cocoa; and, with the fishing for the tortoise, they supply the\r\ndeficiency of cattle, which are at present very few.\r\n\r\nThis town had its commencement upon the river Jamary, from whence it\r\nwas removed to the mouth of the Giparanna, afterwards to the site of\r\nPancau, or Paraxiau, and ultimately to its present situation, where\r\nit was in the year 1756, when King Joseph gave it the title of town.\r\nIt always took the name of the situation where it stood, its various\r\nremovals being caused by the persecutions which the inhabitants\r\nexperienced from the Mura tribe.\r\n\r\nContiguous to this town there is a populous aldeia of unchristianized\r\nMuras, the descendants of those who formerly annoyed the first\r\ninhabitants: they have taken refuge here from the attacks of the\r\nMundrucus.\r\n\r\nVillaboim, yet very small, upon the left bank of the Tapajos, and\r\neighteen miles from the Amazons, is a town well situated: its soil\r\nbeing susceptible of various lucrative branches of agriculture, affords\r\na probability of its future augmentation. The inhabitants are Indians,\r\nand the church is dedicated to St. Ignacio.\r\n\r\nPinhel, a small town, and well situated upon the margin of the Tapajos,\r\nfifteen miles above Villaboim, has a church dedicated to St. Joze. Its\r\ndwellers, almost all Indians, cultivate what they deem necessary, and\r\npursue hunting and shooting, and collect some of the objects of trade,\r\nwhich nature has produced in its fertile vicinity.\r\n\r\nVillanova de Santa Cruz, ten miles above Pinhel and almost in front of\r\nAveyro, is yet insignificant. The houses which form it are generally\r\nvery miserable, and its Mundrucanan inhabitants are hunters, fishermen,\r\nand cultivators only of some necessaries, as is the case with all the\r\nplaces of this district. The increase of Europeans, however, would,\r\nwith adequate industry, render its environs abundantly productive in\r\nevery article of agriculture, the richness of the soil promising the\r\nutmost success.\r\n\r\nAt a considerable distance above Villa Nova de St. Cruz, upon the\r\nwestern margin of the Tapajos, there is an aldeia inhabited by another\r\nhorde of Mundrucus, yet unchristianized, but having their plantations\r\nof Indian corn; while some are already partially clothed, and the women\r\nwear a species of dress also of cotton, called a _sayote_.\r\n\r\nA catechist, a blacksmith, a carpenter, acquainted with agriculture,\r\nand a woman-weaver are deemed sufficient to commence a povoaçao in\r\nthis fertile country, which, with industry, will doubtless soon become\r\nflourishing and useful to the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP. XXIV.\r\n\r\n                         PROVINCE OF SOLIMOES.\r\n\r\n   _Jurisdiction--Origin of its Name--Boundaries and Extent--\r\n   Partially known--Division into Six Districts--Rivers--Various\r\n   Indians--Customs--Povoaçoes._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe province of Solimoes, and the western part of Guianna, with the\r\nwestern portion of Mundrucania, form a government, subordinate to Grand\r\nPara. The eastern part of Guianna is immediately under the jurisdiction\r\nof Para. The first Portuguese who proceeded up the Amazons, from the\r\nmouth of Rio Negro, gave it the name of Solimoes, by which it is yet\r\ndesignated; not in allusion to the venoms with which the Indians of\r\nthese latitudes, as well as those of the low Amazons, infected their\r\narrows, nor to the tribes inhabiting the banks of Rio Negro, who\r\nused the same weapon, but to the nation denominated Soriman, and, by\r\ncorruption, Solimao and Solimoes.\r\n\r\nThe province of Solimoes is bounded on the north by the river of the\r\nsame name, or rather the Amazons; on the west by the Hyabary, which\r\nseparates it from the Spanish dominions; on the south by the same\r\ndominions, the divisionary line between the two territories having been\r\nadjusted by the Portuguese and Spanish commissioners in the year 1751,\r\nand ratified in 1757; and on the east by the Madeira.\r\n\r\nIt is two hundred and fifty miles on the eastern side, from north to\r\nsouth, nearly six hundred miles from east to west, and lies between\r\n3° 23′ and 7° 30′ south latitude. It is a country but little known\r\nexcepting along the Madeira, and in the vicinity of the Amazons:\r\nit is occupied by numerous Indian nations, speaking divers idioms,\r\nand watered by many large and navigable rivers. It produces all the\r\nquadrupeds, reptiles, and birds of the provinces, eastward of the\r\nriver Madeira; a vast variety of plants and trees known to be of great\r\nutility, amongst which are the clove, cupahyba, or capivi, cocoa,\r\nelastic gum, puchery, and cotton. It is well known also that the soil\r\nis highly adapted to the culture of Indian corn, rice, legumes, the\r\ncane, tobacco, mandioco, coffee, bahunilha, or vanilla, inhumes,\r\n(growing like potatoes,) potatoes, and a variety of fruits: however,\r\nthese articles will not prosper equally in all parts. Domestic cattle\r\nare universally in small numbers, and their augmentation depends\r\nupon the Christian portion of population, which, at present, is very\r\ninconsiderable. Nothing satisfactory is known of the mineralogy of the\r\nprovince; but it appears natural that the minerals peculiar to the\r\nadjoining provinces should also be found here.\r\n\r\nThe five following large rivers, Hyutahy, Hyurba, Teffe, Coary, and\r\nPuru, which traverse the province from south to north, with the Madeira\r\nand Hyabary, divide it into six districts of unequal size, and almost\r\nof the same length from north to south: each one takes the name of the\r\nriver that serves for its western limit. We will describe the above\r\ndistricts according to the following order:--\r\n\r\n    Puru\r\n    Coary\r\n    Teffe\r\n    Hyurba\r\n    Hyutahy\r\n    Hyabary.\r\n\r\nThe principal povoaçoes, or towns, of these districts, four having\r\nonly one each, another two, and the last three, were founded by the\r\nSlippered Carmalites. Condamine, the French writer, says, “_Toute\r\nla partie découverte des bords de Rio Negro est peuple de missions\r\nPortugaises, des mêmes religieux du Mont Carmel que nous avions\r\nrencontres en descendant l’Amazone, depuis que nous avions laisse les\r\nmissions Espagnoles_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _District of_ PURU.\r\n\r\nPuru, which lies between the Madeira, and the river from which it\r\nderives its name, has been more explored than any of the contiguous\r\ndistricts, and enjoys the best situation for commerce. From its centre\r\nvarious other considerable rivers flow into the three which form its\r\nconfines. The Capanna and the Uhautas are the largest amongst those\r\nwhich run to the Madeira.\r\n\r\nThe Capanna empties itself one hundred and forty miles above the town\r\nof Borba, after having traversed a considerable lake, which receives\r\ndivers small streams, and from whence there is also an outlet to the\r\nriver Puru. Its environs are inhabited by the Catauixi and Itatapriya\r\nIndians, who are great hunters and fishers.\r\n\r\nThe Uhautas, which has a course of fifty miles, discharges itself\r\nfifteen miles from Borba, and originates in a lake of the same name,\r\nwhich is vast and studded with islands that are overspread with the\r\nclove-tree.\r\n\r\nFrom this lake, which is the receptacle of various small streams,\r\ntwo other rivers issue and flow to the Amazons; one of them enters\r\nit eight miles above the mouth of the Madeira, and the other, called\r\nParatary, one hundred miles further to the west. Eighteen miles below\r\nthe principal mouth of the Rio Negro is the lake d’El Rey, near the\r\nsouthern margin of the Amazons. The Purupuru Indians, who inhabit the\r\ncentral part of the country, give their chief the name of Maranuxauha.\r\n\r\nThe margins of the Amazons and the Rio Negro, upwards, are infested\r\nwith a small musquito, called _pium_, whose painful sting leaves\r\na red mark, accompanied with insufferable itching and a disposition\r\nto ulcerate. One hundred and sixty miles is about the width of this\r\ndistrict on the northern side.\r\n\r\nCratto, yet a small town, but well situated upon the margin of the\r\nMadeira, a considerable distance above Borba, has a church dedicated\r\nto St. Joam Baptista, and its inhabitants are generally Indians and\r\nMesticoes, who collect some cocoa, cloves, and sarsaparilla, with\r\nprovisions of the first necessity. They catch great numbers of the\r\ntortoise at the beach of Tamandoa, which they keep in an enclosure in\r\nthe water. It is one of the ports for canoes coming from Matto-Grosso,\r\nand many circumstances concur in warranting the prediction that it will\r\nbecome one of the principal towns of Solimoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _District of_ COARY.\r\n\r\nThis district extends between the river from which it takes its name\r\nand the principal arm of the Puru, with one hundred and twenty miles\r\nof width on the northern part. The Muras possess the environs of the\r\nAmazons; the Purupurus, and the Catauixis, the centre of the country,\r\nwith other uncivilized nations. Three channels from the Puru irrigate\r\na portion of the eastern part of this comarca in the proximity of the\r\nAmazons;--the Cochiuara which discharges itself twenty-five miles\r\nfrom the mouth of its superior; the Coyuanna, twenty miles above the\r\npreceding; and the Arupanna, more to the westward. The first gives also\r\nits name to this portion of the district; the margins of the whole\r\nafford cocoa, sarsaparilla, and the oil of capivi.\r\n\r\nAlvellos, a small town, is situated upon a large bay, fifteen miles\r\nabove the mouth of the Coary, of which it formerly had the name. Its\r\ninhabitants, for the main part descendants of the Uamanys, Sorimoes,\r\nCatauyseys, Jumas, Irijus, Cuchiuaras, and Uayupes, collect cloves,\r\ncocoa, capivi, and sarsaparilla, and make butter from the eggs of the\r\nTortoise, which are very numerous; and they are also employed in making\r\nearthenware, mats, and in weaving cotton cloth. The ants are here\r\nparticularly destructive.\r\n\r\nThis town was commenced upon the eastern margin and twenty-five miles\r\nabove the month of the river Paratary, from whence the Padre, Frey Joze\r\nda Magdalena, removed it to the same side of the Guanama, which enters\r\nthe northern side of the Amazons, below the eastern arm of the Hyapura:\r\nfrom hence the Padre, Frey Antonio de Miranda, removed it to the site\r\nof Guarayatyba, more to the eastward upon the margin of the Amazons,\r\neight miles below the Puru, from whence it was finally removed by Frey\r\nMauricio Moreyra to its present situation.\r\n\r\nThe islands with which the Amazons in this part is studded, were\r\nfor some time inhabited by Cambeva, otherwise Omagoa Indians--names\r\nwhich signify flat heads, from the custom which the mothers had\r\nof compressing their children’s heads between two boards, thus\r\ndistinguishing them from other nations. This custom ceasing, their\r\ndescendants are at the present day unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _District of_ TEFFE.\r\n\r\nThis comarca, situated between the river from which it is named,\r\nand the Coary, that separates it from the preceding one, is nearly\r\nninety miles in width along the Amazons. The two first rivers are\r\nvery considerable; but their origins are not yet ascertained, nor the\r\nnumber and names of their principal confluents, which issue from the\r\ncentre of the district. All accounts are equally silent as to any\r\nmountains existing in the interior, while the lands in the vicinity of\r\nthe Amazons, although flat, are never inundated by the floods, which\r\noverflow a considerable portion of its northern margin, in consequence\r\nof being lower.\r\n\r\nThe Coary discharges itself into a bay of the Amazons, almost seven\r\nmiles in width, and near it the Urucuparana, and the Urauba, or Cuanu,\r\nboth of short navigation.\r\n\r\nForty miles above, the river Catua enters the Amazons, and twenty more,\r\nwestward, the Cayama, its margins abounding with sarsaparilla; and,\r\nfurther on, the small river Giticaparana, a name implying the river of\r\npotatoes. Its mouth is fifteen miles below the Teffe. From the number\r\nof Christians being so small, and the only persons who clear away any\r\nof the woods for the purposes of agriculture, the country exhibits\r\nthe same aspect to the navigators of the Amazons at this day that was\r\npresented to its first discoverers. The majestic size of various kinds\r\nof trees demonstrates the fecundity and substantial nature of the soil.\r\n\r\nEga, a middling town, well situated upon the right bank of the\r\nTeffe, is eight miles from the Amazons, with a church dedicated\r\nto St. Thereza de Jezus. Almost all its inhabitants are pure\r\nIndians, descended from the Uayupys, Sorimoes, Coretus, Cocurunas,\r\nJumas, Hyupiuhas, Tamuanas, and Achouaris, and cultivate mandioca,\r\n_feijao_, rice, Indian corn, hortulans, and fruits, in sufficient\r\nquantities for their subsistence; they gather honey, and collect some\r\ncocoa, cloves, and pechurim, from the proceeds of which they supply\r\nthemselves with iron tools, baize, and other manufactures for dresses.\r\nThey all pursue hunting and fishing. The women spin cotton, of which\r\nthey manufacture nets and coarse cloths. This town was begun in the\r\nisland of Veados, which is below the mouth of the river Hyurba, from\r\nwhence Frey Andre da Costa removed it to the situation where it now\r\nexists.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _District of_ HYURBA.\r\n\r\nThis district is confined on the north by the Amazons; on the west by\r\nthe river from which it derives its name; on the south by the Spanish\r\ndominions; and on the east by the river Teffe, which separates it from\r\nthe comarca of that name. It has eighty miles of width on the northern\r\npart, and abounds in timber. The rivers are stored with the same fish\r\nas the Amazons, and the woods with a great variety of birds and game,\r\nas well as formidable wild beasts, that wage war with the central\r\nIndians, of whom little more is known than the names.\r\n\r\nNogueyra, a middling town, pleasantly situated upon the left of the\r\nriver Teffe, almost in front of Ega, is ten miles from the Amazons\r\nand ornamented with a church of Nossa Senhora do Rozario. The houses\r\nare intermixed with orange trees, and the streets, being full of\r\nthem, have the appearance of groves. Its inhabitants are principally\r\nIndians of divers nations, and Mesticos, respiring a fresh and\r\nsalubrious atmosphere. They are fond of fishing, collect abundance\r\nof the necessaries of life peculiar to the country, some articles of\r\nexportation, and possess cattle. The first site of this town was more\r\nto the west, on the southern bank of the Amazons, for the habitation\r\nof a numerous assemblage of Indians, namely, Jumas, Ambuas, Cirus,\r\nCatauixis, Uayupes, Hyauhauhays, and Mariaranas, brought together by\r\nthe Carmalite priests. From that situation it was removed to Point\r\nParauary, five miles higher upon the same side of the river, where\r\nCondamine found it with the name of that point in 1743, and from whence\r\nthe priest, Frey Joze de Santa Thereza Ribeyro removed it, in the year\r\n1753, to the place where we have stated it to be situated.\r\n\r\nAlvarens, originally and at times yet called Cahissara, is a small\r\ntown, situated upon a lake, near the margin of the Amazons, eighteen\r\nmiles above the river Teffe. Its church is dedicated to St. Joaquim.\r\nThe population is an accumulation of various tribes of Indians, with\r\nmany Mesticos, who, besides absolute necessaries, cultivate some\r\ncocoa and sarsaparilla, but are much incommoded by the pium musquito,\r\nand alike annoyed by the voracity of the ants. Its first situation\r\nwas upon the channel connecting the Hyapura with the lake Amana, two\r\ndays’ voyage from the Amazons. The Ambuas and Uaruecocas were then its\r\ninhabitants; it was removed from thence to its present site, by one\r\nGiraldo Gonsalves, in 1758. In Nogueyra there is a creek or outlet,\r\nopened by nature, by which canoes, &c. proceed to Alvarens when the\r\nrivers are overflowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _District of_ HYUTAHY.\r\n\r\nThis district is confined by the Amazons on the north; by the river\r\nof its name on the west; by the Spanish possessions on the south; and\r\nby the district of Hyurba on the east: its width along the Amazons is\r\nabout sixty miles. The middle and southern parts are not better known\r\nthan the same portions of the surrounding districts, in consequence\r\nof being in the power of various untamed Indian tribes, such as the\r\nMarauhas, Catuquinas, Urubus, Cauaxis, Uacarauhas, Gemias, Toquedas,\r\nMaturuas, Chibaras, Buges, and Apenaris, with some others, who pass the\r\nrivers into the adjoining districts, and use the _esgaravatana_,\r\nbow and arrow, and envenomed lance, when they go to war.\r\n\r\nIt remains in a state of uncertainty whether the rivers Hyurba, upwards\r\nof six hundred yards in width at its mouth, the Hyutahy, still more\r\nspacious, and the before-mentioned Teffe and Puru, the largest of\r\nall, have their origins in the serras of Peru or issue from the lake\r\nof Rogagualo; their sources have been attributed to both, without\r\nany exploration of their courses or any satisfactory evidence being\r\nadduced in support of those statements. The extensive volume of water\r\nwhich each brings to the Amazons indicates a very considerable course\r\nfrom remote origins. It will be interesting to the future traveller to\r\nexplore their unknown sources and extending margins. The Portuguese\r\ndo not carry their researches amongst the central Indians; and, when\r\nthey advance up the rivers any distance, they never proceed beyond the\r\nlimits of the pacific Indians, with whom they have some commerce.\r\n\r\nFonteboa, a middling povoaçao, is situated on the eastern margin of\r\nthe small river Cayarahy, two miles above its mouth, twenty miles\r\nfrom the embouchure of the Hyurba, and thirty-five below that of the\r\nHyutahy. It has a church dedicated to Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe.\r\nThe first site of this town was upon the small river Capury, which\r\nempties itself into another called Moroentyba, and which latter\r\ndischarges itself below the Manhana, the third branch of the Hyapura.\r\nFrom the Capury it was removed to the mouth of the Moroentyba, and\r\nfrom thence to the situation of Taracoatyba, a short distance from the\r\nManhana, from whence it was removed seven miles below the mouth of\r\nthe Hyutahy, where Condamine says he saw it, and which situation was\r\nchanged for its present one. It is not known what nation were its first\r\ninhabitants. When it was in the fourth station--the Padre, Frey Joam\r\nSt. Jeronymo, collected in it many Pacuna Indians, who were previously\r\nliving in aldeias upon the eastern margin of the river Icapo: these\r\nwere afterwards joined by the Araycas, Marauhas, and Momanas, and,\r\nultimately, by the Tacunas, Tumbiras, and Passes. The whole are now\r\nagriculturists, fishermen, and hunters.\r\n\r\nBetween Fonteboa and the Hyurba the Annamapiu is discharged; and, in\r\nthe interval, between that town and the Hyutahy, five rivers more--the\r\nCampina, Gurumaty, Puruini, Mannarua, and Icapo, which afford so many\r\nsheltering places for the canoes at the periods of tempests in the\r\nAmazons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _District of_ HYABARY.\r\n\r\nThis district, which is the most westerly, is confined on the north by\r\nthe Amazons, as the others are on the west by the river from which it\r\ntakes its name, separating it from the Spanish dominions; on the south\r\nby the line of demarcation between the two countries, common to the\r\nother districts; and on the east by the Hyutahy, from whose mouth to\r\nthat of the Hyabary may be computed one hundred and seventy miles. Both\r\nthese boundary rivers produce the same fish as the Amazons, and both\r\nafford extensive navigation for the exportation of such productions as\r\nmay be collected upon their respective margins. In the vicinity of both\r\nthere is sarsaparilla, and also cocoa. Their confluents are totally\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nTheir extensive woods, which produce in vain, for the benefit of man,\r\nthe most precious timber, are occupied by the wild boar, anta, deer,\r\nand other quadrupeds and bipeds, which are pursued as game by the\r\nhitherto savage nations of Marauhas, Uaraycus, and the Tapaxanas, who\r\ninhabit the lower part of the country in the vicinity of the Amazons.\r\nAt a greater distance are the Panos and the Mayurunas, who make a crown\r\nupon the top of the head, and allow the hair to grow to the utmost\r\nlength. They have perforations in the nose and lips, into which they\r\nintroduce long thorns; in the corners of the mouth they carry feathers\r\nof the macaw; from the lower lip and the extremity of the nose and ears\r\nstrings of shells are pendant. They are cannibals, and, when any are\r\nseriously ill, their relations kill and eat them, before the disease\r\ncan cut the thread of life. The Chimanos and the Culinos are well\r\nknown, amongst other tribes, from having the face very round and the\r\neyes extremely large.\r\n\r\nCastro d’ Avelaens is inhabited by Indians of different nations, with\r\na church dedicated to St. Christovam, on the margin of the Amazons,\r\ntwenty miles above the mouth of the Ica. It was first established lower\r\ndown, between the small rivers Aruty and Matura, in the territory\r\nof the Cambevas, and experienced four other changes, similar to the\r\npreceding povoaçoes, before it was finally fixed in its present\r\nsituation. In the interval from this town to the river Hyutahy, the\r\nsmall rivers Capatana, Aruty, Matura, Maturacupa, and the Patia enter\r\nthe Amazons.\r\n\r\nOllivença, _ci-devant_ St. Paulo, by which name it is yet\r\noccasionally called, is a small place, well situated upon the margin of\r\nthe Amazons, forty miles above Castro d’Avaleans. It has had several\r\nremovals, and was incorporated with the aldeia of St. Pedro, about\r\none mile above the place where it now stands. Its first inhabitants\r\nwere Cambeva, Tecuna, Juri, and Passe Indians. In the interval between\r\nCastro d’Avaleans and Ollivença the small rivers Acuruhy and Jandiatiba\r\ndischarge themselves.\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Joze, situated upon the Amazons, thirty-five miles from\r\nOllivença and ten below the Hyabary, is occupied by Tacuna Indians,\r\nwho cultivate the necessaries of life and pursue hunting and fishing.\r\nBetween this town and Ollivença are the rivers Acuty, Camatia, Pacuty,\r\nMacapuana, and Hyuruparitapera, and between the same town and the\r\nHyabary is the lake Maracanatyba.\r\n\r\nNear the embouchure of the Hyabary is the prezidio of Tabatinga,\r\ndedicated to St. Francisco Xavier. Upwards of sixteen hundred miles are\r\ncomputed by the canoe-men from Para to this place, and they consume\r\neighty-seven days in the voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP. XXV.\r\n\r\n                         PROVINCE OF GUIANNA.\r\n\r\n            _Boundaries--Islands--Rivers--Towns--Indians._\r\n\r\n\r\nGuianna forms the eastern and southern portion of the region\r\ndenominated Terra Firma, confined on the north by the ocean and the\r\nriver Oronoco; on the south by the Amazons; on the east by the ocean;\r\nand on the west by the rivers Hyapura and Oronoco.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese Guianna, which includes that belonging to the French\r\nsince 1809, comprises the southern part of that vast province and\r\ncelebrated island, and is bounded on the north by the Spanish\r\npossessions and Surinam: the other boundaries are those already\r\nmentioned. It is nine hundred miles in length from east to west, and\r\nthree hundred at its greatest width, and extends from 6° north to\r\n4° south latitude. The days and nights, with very little variation,\r\nare equal all the year, and the climate is exceedingly warm. The\r\nterritory is not generally fertile, and has more of a flat than\r\nmountainous aspect. In many parts of the interior it is very stony,\r\nwith indications of ancient volcanos. It is irrigated by many navigable\r\nrivers, some of which originate in an extensive range of mountains, of\r\nno great altitude, prolonged with the Amazons from east to west, but at\r\na considerable distance from it.\r\n\r\nTrees are only of magnitude in the vicinity of the rivers and in the\r\nsubstantial and humid soils. The most useful are those of the clove,\r\npechurim, capivi, Indian rubber, and cocoa.\r\n\r\nMinerals of iron have been found; there are symptoms of silver, and\r\nsome stones of estimation.\r\n\r\nNorth Cape (Cabo do Norte) is the principal cape, situated in 2° north.\r\n\r\nISLANDS.--Terra dos Coelhos is between the mouths of the\r\nAruary and the Carapapury, with a channel on the west and the ocean on\r\nthe east, on which side is the point called North Cape above mentioned.\r\n\r\nMaraca is an island eighteen miles in length, with proportionable\r\nwidth, a little to the north-west of the Coelhos. It has in the centre\r\na large lake, stored with fish, and its eastern coast is assailed by\r\nthe Pororoca.\r\n\r\nBetween Macappa and North Cape a narrow channel is formed by the\r\nislands which range along the coast; and here is remarked a singular\r\nphenomenon, denominated pororoca, (the same term we have already\r\ndescribed as given to the contention of the waters at the mouth of\r\nthe Mearim, in the province of Maranham,) which continues three days,\r\nat the periods of the change and full moon, when the tides are at the\r\nhighest. An immense volume of water, twelve to fifteen feet in height,\r\nrolls from one beach to the other, followed by a second, and third,\r\nand sometimes a fourth, of equal magnitude, with little interval, and\r\nwith such prodigious rapidity that it destroys every thing opposed to\r\nits overwhelming course. The tide, in place of gradually rising in six\r\nhours, reaches its greatest height in one or two minutes, with such a\r\nterrific noise that it is heard seven or eight miles off.\r\n\r\nThe island of Penitencia, called Baylique by the Portuguese, in\r\nconsequence of the tossing which the canoes here sustain from the sea,\r\nis six miles long, and sixty south of North Cape.\r\n\r\nThe islands of Croa are five in a file, separated by narrow channels,\r\nand lie to the south-west of Baylique. The whole are flat, and covered\r\nwith mangroves, where there is an infinity of musquitos and insects.\r\n\r\nThe river Nhamunda, by corruption Jamunda, divides this vast province\r\ninto eastern and western, serving also for a limit between the\r\njurisdictions of the ouvidores of Para and of Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--In the western part are, first, the Hyapuru and the\r\nRio Negro; afterwards the Rio Branco (White River); the Matary, with\r\ntwo mouths; the Urubu, communicating with the river Aniba by the great\r\nlake Saraca, which is near the Amazons, and is there discharged by six\r\nmouths.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part are the Trombetas, originally Oriximina, large, and\r\nentering the Amazons below Rio Negro; the Gurupatuba; the Anauirapucu,\r\nby corruption Arannapucu, the Vaccarapy, and the Aruary, which enters\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nThe river Hyapura originates in the province of Popayan, and, after\r\nhaving watered eleven hundred miles of country, running towards the\r\nsouth-east, forming numerous islands of all dimensions, incorporates\r\nitself with the Amazons by its several mouths. Its adjacent lands are\r\nflat, inundated, and bad: Caqueta is its first name in the country\r\nwhere it rises.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Negro rises also in the province of Popayan, to the north-east\r\nof the Hyapura, with which it runs parallel an equal distance. Forty\r\nmiles before it enters the Amazons it is divided into two unequal\r\nbranches. Condamine says that he measured the eastern branch, ten\r\nmiles from the Amazons, and that he found it in the narrowest part\r\nseven thousand two hundred and eighteen feet in width. This river\r\naugments considerably as it approaches the Amazons, is in parts from\r\ntwelve to eighteen miles in width, and is divided into various branches\r\nby numerous islands, which render the navigation not unfavourable.\r\nIts water exhibits such a dark aspect that it has been said to appear\r\nlike black ink; it is, notwithstanding, transparent, diuretic, and\r\nsalubrious, retaining its clearness for many leagues after it enters\r\nthe bed of the Amazons. It has the same fish as the latter, and affords\r\nnavigation to the centre of various districts. The greatest floods are\r\nin August. We will describe its numerous confluents, together with the\r\npovoaçoes upon its margins.\r\n\r\nThe towns of the eastern portion of the province are\r\n\r\n    Macappa\r\n    Mazagao\r\n    Villanova\r\n    Arrayollos\r\n    Espozende\r\n    Almeyrim\r\n    Outeyro\r\n    Montalegre\r\n    Prado\r\n    Alemquer\r\n    Obydos\r\n    Faro\r\n    Cayenna.\r\n\r\nThe towns of the western portion are\r\n\r\n    Sylves\r\n    Serpa\r\n    Marippy\r\n    Rio Negro\r\n    Barcellos\r\n    Moura\r\n    Thomar.\r\n\r\nMacappa is the most considerable town of the province, situated\r\nupon the margin of the Amazons, four miles north of the equator, on\r\nelevated land, with a very good fort, a church dedicated to St. Joze,\r\nan hospital, tolerable streets, and houses covered with tiles. It had\r\nits commencement twelve miles further to the west, at the embouchure of\r\nthe Matapy. Its inhabitants cultivate Indian corn, mandioca, rice, some\r\ncocoa, cotton, and various fruits. Amongst other trees of estimation in\r\nits environs there is one called _quatiara_, the wood of which is\r\nyellow, having black stripes; also the _macaco_ wood.\r\n\r\nSixty-five miles east of Macappa is Robordello, reduced to little note\r\nby the desertion of the Indians who inhabited it. It is situated upon\r\nthe southern margin of the island of Cavianna, which is thirty-five\r\nmiles in length and twenty in width; the land is flat and fertile,\r\nwith a fine farm or fazenda of cattle, belonging to the Hospital da\r\nSanta Caza, (Holy House,) of Mizericordia, at Para. It produces the\r\n_macaco_ wood, and the whole of its circuit abounds with fish.\r\n\r\nVillanova is situated on the eastern bank, and twenty-five miles above\r\nthe embouchure of the considerable river Anauirapucu, which originates\r\nin the territory of the Armabutos. It was founded for the establishment\r\nof white people, but is going into a state of decay in consequence of\r\nits desertion by them; those who remain are cultivators of mandioca,\r\nIndian corn, and rice; and fish in the channels of the island of Croa.\r\nIt possesses fine _campinhas_ for breeding cattle; and in its\r\nenvirons the _macaco_ wood grows, which is heavy,--those growing\r\nin dry lands are entirely red, and others in a different soil are\r\nshaded with black.\r\n\r\nMazagao originated on an island at the mouth of the Matapy, experienced\r\nseveral changes of situation, and was ultimately fixed five miles above\r\nthe bar of the Matuaca, where it runs into the Amazons, and nearly\r\nfifteen miles west of the Anauirapucu. St. Anna was its primitive name,\r\nwhich it lost on the establishment in it of the people of the Praca de\r\nMazagao, from the kingdom of Marrocos, who were afterwards augmented by\r\nvarious families from the Azore islands. Cotton and rice are the riches\r\nof its dwellers, who are diminishing in consequence of the prevalence\r\nof fevers. In its districts there are various excellent earths for\r\npotteries, but their productions are very indifferent.\r\n\r\nForty miles to the south-west of Mazagao, and near twenty-five from the\r\nAmazons, is the parish of Fragozo, on the right margin of the Jary,\r\nwith a church of St. Antonio. Its inhabitants collect cloves, cocoa,\r\ncotton, sarsaparilla, &c. and advance up the Amazons in search of the\r\ntortoise. Between Fragozo and Mazagao is the parish of St. Anna, on the\r\nmargin of the fine river Cajary: rice, cotton, and some cocoa, are its\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nArrayollos is a small town, agreeably situated upon a small hill near\r\nthe eastern margin, and fifteen miles above the mouth of the Aramucu.\r\nIt has two large open spaces, with some semblance to squares, a\r\nchurch dedicated to Nossa Senhora do Rozario, and inhabitants who are\r\nagriculturists and fishermen.\r\n\r\nEspozende a Villota, or Small Town, in an elevated situation upon\r\nthe Tubare, commanding fine views of the surrounding Campinhas, has\r\na church of Our Lady do Rozario, and is ten miles north-west of\r\nArrayollos. Fishing, hunting, the cultivation of cotton, Indian corn,\r\nrice, and mandioca, is the occupation of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAlmeyrim is a middling town, occupying an advantageous site at the\r\nmouth of the Paru, of which it first took the name, and originating\r\nin a Dutch fort, which is yet preserved. There is a diversity of\r\nexcellent timber in its environs, and the inhabitants are fishermen,\r\nand cultivate mandioca, Indian corn, rice, legumes, and cotton. Twenty\r\nmiles above Almeyrim is the parish of Our Lady of Desterro, at the\r\nmouth of the considerable Vaccarapy. Fishing, hunting, and the culture\r\nof cotton and common necessaries, occupy its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOuteyro, a middling town, well supplied with fish, is situated upon\r\na small hill on the eastern side of the lake Urubuquara, formed by\r\nthe river of the same name; it is fifteen miles from the Amazons, and\r\nsixty-five west of Almeyrim. The church is dedicated to Nossa Senhora\r\nof Graca, and its productions are similar to those of the preceding\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMontalegre, a considerable town, also abounding with fish, is situated\r\non the highest portion of a small island, near the eastern margin\r\nof the Gurupatuba, which forms it. It is thirty-five miles above\r\nOuteyro, and seven from the Amazons, and was one of the principal\r\nmissions of the Jesuits, whose Hospicio is now the residence of the\r\nvicar. Mandioca, _feijao_, cotton, cocoa, and coffee, are its\r\nproductions. In its district the clove-tree prospers, and it has a\r\nsaw-pit, on account of the treasury, for sawing the trunks of the\r\ncedars that the floods of the Amazons deposit upon a neighbouring\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nPrado is yet a small place, upon the eastern branch of the river\r\nSurubui, twenty miles from the Amazons, and fifty west of Montalegre.\r\nIts inhabitants are Indians, and live by some agriculture, hunting, and\r\nfishing.\r\n\r\nAlemquer is a considerable town, supplied with excellent meat, and well\r\nsituated upon the central embouchure of the lake Surubui, fifteen miles\r\nfrom the Amazons, and fifty north of Santarem. It is a country infested\r\nwith the musquito, called _carapana_. The church is dedicated to\r\nSt. Antonio. Mandioca, Indian corn, rice, tobacco, and cocoa, are its\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nCuruamanema is the name of the third and western outlet of the lake\r\nSurubui.\r\n\r\nObydos, formerly Pauxis, the name of the Indians for whose\r\nestablishment it began, is a considerable town, upon a small hill,\r\nwith some regularity, and a large square in the centre, near the\r\neastern mouth of the Trombetas, with an extensive view of the Amazons,\r\nthe whole of whose waters here rapidly descend by a channel about\r\na mile in width, but of such profundity, that the attempts to find\r\nthe bottom by sounding, have been unsuccessful. It has a magnificent\r\nchurch, dedicated to St. Anna, and is fifty miles west of Alemquer. The\r\ninhabitants cultivate divers necessaries of life, cotton, and a large\r\nquantity of cocoa, which is in the highest repute at the capital.\r\n\r\nFaro is a middling town, near a large lake, traversed by the river\r\nJamunda, forty miles west-north-west of Obydos, and above twenty from\r\nthe Amazons. Its church is dedicated to St. Joam Baptista, and the soil\r\nis well adapted to the produce of cocoa, the principal wealth of its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nSylves is a small place, situated upon the summit of an island near the\r\nmargin of the lake Saraca, eighty miles west-north-west of Faro, and\r\ntwenty distant from the Amazons. It abounds in fish and the necessaries\r\nof life peculiar to the country. It has a church of St. Anna, and the\r\ninhabitants are of various classes and colours, as are those of the\r\nother towns, and cultivate excellent tobacco, cotton, cocoa, cloves,\r\nand sarsaparilla.\r\n\r\nSerpa is a middling town upon a small island of the Amazons, near its\r\nnorthern bank, fifty miles from Sylves, and thirty-five below the\r\nmouth of the Madeira. It has a church of Nossa Senhora of Rozario, and\r\ninhabitants who derive a partial benefit from the rich productions that\r\nnature has bestowed upon this country.\r\n\r\nForty miles to the north-west of Serpa is the parish of Our Lady of\r\nConceiçao, advantageously situated on the margin of the great lake\r\nCanuma. Its productions are among the commerce and necessaries of life.\r\nTwenty miles north-west of the preceding, and forty from the Amazons,\r\nthe parish of St. Raymundo, on the margin of the Urubu, is occupied by\r\nIndians, who collect some articles of exportation. Fifty miles west of\r\nConceiçao and forty from the Amazons, is the parish of Nossa Senhora\r\ndo Socorro, near the lake of Matary, with productions similar to the\r\npreceding one.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles above the parish of St. Raymundo is that of St. Pedro\r\nNolasco, also on the margin of the Urubu. Its inhabitants are Indians,\r\nand their mode of life and productions do not differ from the others.\r\n\r\nMarippy is a middling town, on the left bank of the Hyapura, thirty\r\nmiles from the Amazons, the church is of St. Antonio, and its\r\ninhabitants are an accumulation of divers Indian nations, amongst\r\nwhom are the Miranhas, who possessed part of the territory between\r\nthe Hyapura and the Ica. They are fishermen and hunters, and collect\r\na portion of the productions of nature in its environs. Fevers do not\r\npermit Europeans to reside here in any number.\r\n\r\nRio Negro, a considerable and flourishing town, capital of the\r\nprovince, and head of the Ouvidoria of the same name, has a church of\r\nNossa Senhora da Conceiçao, and is situated near a small hill, on the\r\nleft margin of the eastern branch of the Rio Negro, ten miles from\r\nthe Amazons. Its origin was a fort, now existing, near which various\r\nfamilies were established, of the Bamba, Barre, and Passe nations. It\r\nis the depository of divers mercantile productions, which descend by\r\nthe river, and are destined for exportation. It has a manufactory of\r\ncord from _piacaba_, one for weaving cotton cloth, and a pottery,\r\nall worked on account of the treasury. The main part of the cattle\r\nkilled here are embarked from the royal fazendas of Rio Branco. Above\r\nthe extremity of the town the Cachoeira discharges itself, which, four\r\nmiles distant, forms a handsome cataract, whose murmuring descent is\r\nheard at this place.\r\n\r\nOne hundred miles above the capital is the parish of Ayrao, with a\r\nchurch of St. Elias, on the southern margin of the Rio Negro. It\r\nfirst began upon a large bay near the capital, for the habitation of\r\nthe Taruma and Aroaqui Indians. In the interval between these places\r\nthe Rio Negro receives, on the southern margin, the Hyborena, and on\r\nthe northern, the Ayurim, the Anauene, and the small rivers Cunamau,\r\nMapauhau, and Uacriuan, which empties itself almost in front of Ayrao.\r\n\r\nMoura is a small town, forty miles above Ayrao, of an agreeable aspect,\r\nand with some regularity, upon the right bank of the Rio Negro. The\r\nchurch is of St. Ritta, and its inhabitants are principally descendants\r\nof whites and Indian females. It originated in the assemblage of\r\nfour Indian nations--the Carahyahys, Cocuannas, Mannaus, and Jumas,\r\nafter which it had one or two removals previously to being fixed in\r\nits present situation. A little above Ayrao, the Jaumuhi enters the\r\nRio Negro, and fifteen miles below Moura the Anany, both connecting\r\nthe river that receives them with the Cadaya, the eastern arm of the\r\nHyapura, through the medium of the large lake Atinineni, in whose\r\nvicinity the cupahyba, or capivi, trees abound. The Hyanapary, by\r\ncorruption Jaguapiri, enters the northern margin of the Rio Negro,\r\nalmost in front of Moura. This river, whose waters are white, has an\r\nextensive course. The Aroaqui Indians extend themselves from its banks\r\nto those of the before-mentioned Anauene.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight miles above Moura, on the southern margin of the Rio\r\nNegro, is the parish of Carvoeyro, having experienced several changes\r\nof situation, with a church of St. Alberto, and inhabitants mainly of\r\nthe Manau, Parauanno, and Maranacuacena nations. Between Moura and\r\nCarvoeyro not one river enters the Rio Negro by the southern bank; on\r\nthe northern the large river Branco, (White,) so called from the colour\r\nof its waters, discharges itself by four mouths, three very near, being\r\nformed by two small islands, the other, called Amayauhau, is fifteen\r\nmiles above. This river is the largest confluent of the Rio Negro,\r\nand rises in the southern skirts of the serra Barocayna, receiving,\r\non the eastern side, in the following order, the small river Macoary,\r\nthe outlet of the lake Uadauhau, the river Ememeneny, the waters of\r\nthe lakes Curuicu and Uariary, and the river Uanauhau. On the western\r\nmargin the rivers Coratirimani, Eniuini, Ayarani, Cauame, and Ucayay.\r\n\r\nFifty miles above Carvoeyra is the parish of Poyares, upon the same\r\nside of the Rio Negro, ornamented with a church of Santa Angelo, and\r\noccupied by the Manao, Bare, and Passe Indians. Between Carvoeyra and\r\nPoyares the river Cauhaury enters the Rio Negro, on the southern side;\r\nand, on the western, the small rivers Uanapixi, Uaniba, and Cuaru.\r\n\r\nBarcellos, twenty miles above Poyares, on the same margin of the\r\nriver, is the largest town of the province, being for many years the\r\nresidence of its governors, with a church of Our Lady of Conceiçao,\r\nand inhabitants of various classes, who are agriculturists, fishermen,\r\nhunters, and dealers. In the interval between Poyares and Barcellos\r\nthe Rio Negro only receives the Uatahanary, eight miles below the\r\nlatter place, on the southern side; on the northern, the small rivers\r\nUyrauhau, Hyamurauhau, and Buhybuhy, the latter in front of the same\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nFifty miles above Barcellos is the small town of Moreyra, on an\r\neminence, upon the southern bank of Rio Negro. Nossa Senhora do Carmo\r\nis the patroness of its church, and its inhabitants are descendants of\r\nEuropeans married to Indian females. In the interval from Barcellos to\r\nMoreyra the Rio Negro receives, on the southern side, the rivers Barury\r\nand Quihyuny, and the small rivers Aratahy and Quemehueury; on the\r\nnorthern, the Parataqui and the Uaraca, which receives, on the left,\r\nthe Demene, upon whose margins formerly dwelt the Guianna Indians.\r\n\r\nThomar, a small town, fifty miles above Moreyra, with potteries\r\nalong the southern margin of the Rio Negro, is situated in a country\r\nwell adapted for the culture of indigo. Its church is of Our Lady\r\nof Rozario, and the inhabitants are composed of persons of divers\r\ncomplexions, who collect only the necessaries of subsistence. It began\r\none hundred miles higher up, for the habitation of the Manao, Bare,\r\nUayuana, and Passe tribes. In the interval from Moreyra to Thomar the\r\nRio Negro receives, on the southern side, the Urarira, whose margins\r\nwere possessed formerly by the valorous Manao Indians, who extended\r\nthemselves as far as the river Chiuara. They admitted two gods--one the\r\nauthor of good, denominated _Mauary_, the other of evil, called\r\n_Sarauhe_. Their idiom prevailed amongst the other tribes with\r\nwhom they lived. On the northern margin it receives the river Uerere,\r\nwhose territories were, in other times, inhabited by the Carahyahy and\r\nUaryhua nations; and the Padauiry, opposite the town of Thomar, which\r\nis a large river of white-coloured water, and traverses the lands of\r\nthe ancient Oremanaos, gathering on the left the Uexie Mirim.\r\n\r\nTen miles above Thomar is Lamalonga, an Indian povoaçao of Manaos,\r\nBares, and Banibas, situated on the right bank of the Rio Negro. Some\r\ndispute between the Captains Alexander de Souza Cabary and Joze Joam\r\nDary, residents of Thomar, occasioned the latter to retire with his\r\npeople to this situation, where they founded a church dedicated to\r\nSt. Joze; it was afterwards augmented by the Indians of the aldeia of\r\nAuacyhyda, which was ten miles higher up the river.\r\n\r\nFifty miles beyond Lamalonga is the parish of St. Izabel, an Indian\r\npovoaçao of Uaupes, on the southern bank of the Rio Negro, which, in\r\nthis interval, receives, on the right, the Chibaru and Maba, and, on\r\nthe left, the Hyhyaha and Daraha.\r\n\r\nSixty miles above St. Izabel is the aldeia of Maracaby, on the northern\r\nmargin of the Rio Negro, whose current is here very violent, in\r\nconsequence of the stones which overspread its bed, occasioning the\r\ncanoes to be unloaded. In this interval the rivers Hyurubaxy, Uayhuana,\r\nUenenexy, and Chuiara, enter the Rio Negro on the right: the first\r\nforms large lakes above its bar, and communicates with the Hyapura. The\r\nrivers Marauya, Hyarudy, Inabu, Abuara, Sabururuha, Diba, and Cauabury\r\nenter it on the left. The margins of the Marauya, which were formerly\r\ninhabited by the Caranaos, who made a very long resistance to the\r\nManaos, have cocoa and sarsaparilla near the serras; these productions\r\nare also common on the borders of some of the other rivers.\r\n\r\nAfter Maracaby are the parishes of Caldas on the northern bank, and\r\nalmost in front of it, on the southern, is Loreto; further on, St.\r\nPedro, on the opposite side; and afterwards St. Antonio, on the\r\nsouthern margin, inhabited by Bare, Macu, and Meppury Indians.\r\n\r\nTen miles above, on the same side, is the aldeia of St. Joam\r\nNepomuceno: in this interval no currents enter the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nForty miles further, on the opposite bank, is the parish of St.\r\nBernardo. This interval is covered with large stones, and, having two\r\nfalls, is passed with great difficulty. On the right, the rivers Maria\r\nand Curicuriau, and on the left the Uacaburu, Maruhueny, Uhuhybara,\r\nCassabu, and Miuha enter the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nTwelve miles above, on the northern side, is the parish of Nazareth,\r\noccupied by Ayriney, Baremacu, and Meppury Indians.\r\n\r\nA few miles further, on the same side, near the large falls of Crocoby,\r\nis the fort of St. Gabriel, with a povoaçao of Bares.\r\n\r\nContinuing to advance up the Rio Negro about thirty-five miles, the\r\nparish of St. Joaquim do Coanne is met with, three miles from its\r\nsouthern bank, and upon the right of the Uaupe, which communicates with\r\nthe Curicuriau by a channel called Inebu. In this space, where there\r\nare some dangerous places, denominated Caldeirao and Paredao, with many\r\nreefs, the Rio Negro receives two nameless streams on the right, and on\r\nthe left the Mabuaby, Hyhya, and two others without names.\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned Uaupe, which is large, receives on the southern\r\nside the considerable river Tiquie, whose mouth is five days’ voyage\r\nfrom St. Joaquim. It took the name of the Uaupe Indians, who perforate\r\nthe lower lips and ears, and carry around their necks a white\r\ncylindrical and polished stone.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles above the mouth of the Uaupe is the large river\r\nIcanna; which runs parallel with it and the Uexie. Six days’ voyage\r\nupwards by the Icanna there is a large cataract; and, one day more,\r\nthe bar of the large river Coyary is arrived at, that joins it on the\r\nnorthern side; it receives also the Mabuyauha, which rises a short\r\ndistance from the Uexie.\r\n\r\nIn the upper angle of the mouth of the river Uaupe is the parish of St.\r\nMiguel; and a little higher, on the same side of the Rio Negro, is the\r\nparish of Nossa Senhora of Guia, both inhabited by Baniba Indians.\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Anna follows on the northern bank; afterwards St.\r\nFillipe on the southern; and, more distant, that of St. Joam Baptista,\r\ninhabited by Baniba Indians.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles higher, the Rio Negro receives the large river Uexie,\r\nwhich waters the territories of the Bannyba, Capuenna, Mendo, and\r\nUerequenna Indians. Between this river and the Icanna, the large serra\r\nof Tunuhy prolongs itself. In the vicinity of this confluence is the\r\nparish of St. Marcellinoino.\r\n\r\nThirty miles above is the fort of St. Joze of the Marabytannas, also on\r\nthe southern side, with a povoaçao of Arihiny and Marybytanna Indians,\r\nbeing the last Portuguese colony upon the Rio Negro, which after the\r\nUexie receives no other stream on that side, but the Beturu and the\r\nconsiderable Dimity enters it on the northern.\r\n\r\nThe canoe-men of Para compute fifteen hundred miles from Para to this\r\nfort, and for the accomplishment of the voyage they consume nearly\r\nninety days.\r\n\r\nThirty miles above the forte of St. Joze, on the northern bank of\r\nthe Rio Negro, is the embouchure of the river Cassiquiary, being a\r\nchannel of one hundred and eighty miles, opened by nature, and forming\r\na communication between the two immense rivers, the Oronoco and the\r\nAmazons.\r\n\r\nIn 1756, there were only eight missions upon the Rio Negro, viz. Jahu,\r\nPedreira, Aracary, Camara, Maryua, Bararua, Camaru, and Dary. The first\r\nis the nearest, and the last is the most distant from the fort upon the\r\nbar of the said river.\r\n\r\nUpon the margins of the Rio Branco are the parishes of St. Maria,\r\nSt. Joam Baptista, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, St. Fillipe, St. Antonio,\r\nSt. Barbara, and St. Joaquim with a fort, which is eleven hundred\r\nmiles distant from the city of Para, and from sixty to seventy days’\r\nvoyage. The inhabitants are Indians; and the houses of the whole are\r\ncovered with palm branches. Amongst the beautiful birds peculiar to the\r\nvicinity of the Rio Negro, is one called the _gallo da serra_,\r\n(the cock of the serra,) a little larger than the blackbird, with\r\nstrong legs, having spurs like a cock, with a similar beak; its\r\nplumage is exceedingly beautiful, of an orange colour, with a bunch of\r\nfeathers, in the form of a fan, open from the neck almost to the point\r\nof the bill, being of the same colour, with a rose-coloured stripe near\r\nthe border. These birds are very rare.\r\n\r\nCayenna, a considerable town, and well situated in the northern part\r\nof the island, upon the embouchure of the river of the same name, on\r\nground rather elevated, is encircled with walls, which are only of\r\nstone on the side of the port, where there is a gate and a wooden\r\nbridge. All the edifices are of earth, with two or three steps at the\r\nentrance. The palace of the governors is not higher, and is surrounded\r\nwith orange trees, having a square in front. There is a fort,\r\ndenominated the Citadel, in the most elevated situation, being almost\r\nits only defence. It is the only remarkable town in the ex-French\r\nGuianna, which that nation commonly called Equinoctial France, whose\r\nnorthern limit is the river Marony. In the treaty of Utrecht, the river\r\nVincent Pinson, was named as the common limit between Portuguese and\r\nFrench Guianna, the engagement of the French Monarch on this subject\r\nwas conceived in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“_Sa Majeste se desistera pour toujours comme elle se desiste des\r\nà present par ce traite dans les termes les plus forts, et les plus\r\nauthentiques, et avec toutes les causes riquises comme se elles\r\nétoient inserées ici, taut en son nom, qu’en celui de ses hoirs,\r\nsuccesseurs, et héritiers de tous droits et pretentions, qu’elle peut\r\non pourra prétendre sur la propriété des terres appellées du Cap du\r\nNord, et situées entre la riviere des Amasones et celle de Iapoe, ou\r\nde Vincent Pinson, sans se reserver on retenir aucune portion des\r\ndites terres, afin qu’elles soient desormais possedées par sa Majesté\r\nPortugaise.]_”\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese and French always gave the name of Vincent Pinson to the\r\nriver Oayapoek; the latter nation, after Condamine, wished the boundary\r\nline to be considered the Aguary, by them called Arauary, which\r\ndischarges itself near two hundred miles further to the south-east;\r\nbut the French never had any kind of establishment south of the\r\nOayapoek.[44] The fort of St. Louiz, which changed its name to that of\r\nSt. Francisco with the revolution, situated fifteen miles from the sea,\r\non the northern margin of the Oayapoek, was always the most southern\r\nestablishment of Equinoctial France.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Madrid, in 1801, the Portuguese crown, unwillingly\r\nceded the territory north of the Carapanatuba. In the following year,\r\nby the treaty of Amiens, the divisionary line received twenty leagues,\r\nthe river Aguary then serving as the limit, as well as subsequently to\r\nthe conquest of the country.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1630, the French established themselves here, under the\r\nsame evil star that has influenced all their conquests in the western\r\nhemisphere. Shortly afterwards, abandoning their establishments on\r\nTerra Firma, they removed to the island of Cayenna, where they remained\r\ntill the year 1655, without the colony arriving at that flourishing\r\nstate which was expected. In this year it passed under the dominion of\r\nthe British government, and was retained by us till the year 1674. The\r\nDutch took possession of it at this time, and kept it for four years.\r\n\r\nVarious obstacles were opposed to the activity of the colonists\r\n(who always lived in hopes of fortune being more propitious) to the\r\nperiod of the revolution, which threw every thing into a worse state;\r\nwith it disappeared some small towns and Indian aldeias which were\r\non the island and upon the continent, beginning with an Hospicio of\r\nFranciscans.\r\n\r\nThe island of Cayenna, formed by the river of the same name, the\r\nMahory, and a narrow and winding strait by which they communicate, is\r\ntwenty miles long from north to south, of proportionable width, and\r\nirregular form; the land is low, diversified with gentle elevations,\r\nand overspread with timber. The soil is sandy, and black at the\r\nsurface; at the depth of two feet it is red, and is favourable to the\r\ngrowth of coffee, cotton, Indian corn, indigo, mandioca, and the cane.\r\nDuring the rainy season the vegetation is abundant for the sustenance\r\nof oxen, horses, goats, sheep, and wild quadrupeds. In the three months\r\nof most rigorous drought all these animals suffer from hunger, and many\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous small rivers of soft water, which carry various\r\nsugar works. The channel which separates it from the continent conducts\r\nto the port the productions of that side. Notwithstanding the east\r\nwind refreshes the atmosphere every morning, the air is unwholesome,\r\nin consequence of the contiguous morasses, which breed an immensity\r\nof various species of insects, such as _mosquitos_, large toads,\r\nants, and many others, that annoy the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP. XXVI.\r\n\r\n                      _Conclusive Observations._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great disparity between the actual condition of the Brazil and\r\nthat which, from its pure climate, fertile soil, numerous rivers, and\r\nimmense extent, it is capable of attaining, is the main circumstance\r\nthat will be suggested to the reader by the perusal of the foregoing\r\npages. The climate is indeed generally so salubrious that diseases are\r\nas rare as in any part of the globe, much less as fatal as they are\r\noften found to be in similar latitudes. In a region so extensive the\r\nclimates are necessarily various, but, with the exception of some of\r\nthe _pantanos_, or morasses, and stagnant waters remaining after\r\ninundations, the country is for the main part exceedingly wholesome;\r\nand, as far as my own information and observation has extended, the\r\nprovinces immediately bordering upon the equator, are equally, if\r\nnot more healthful than many nearer the tropical line. The soil is\r\nso fertile that a much less portion of culture is requisite for its\r\nabundant production than is found necessary for most other countries of\r\nthe world, and is, indeed, to a very large extent, almost spontaneously\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nThe facilities are incalculable which it might supply to commerce, and\r\ntowards increasing and aggrandizing its people from the multitudinous\r\nrivers that pour beauty, comfort, and health, into its extensive tract.\r\nThe advantages already mentioned, with its diversified aspect, its\r\nchampaign and its hilly surface, its noble mountains and woods, where\r\nsport a great variety of beautiful and useful animals, its groves of\r\nnumerous kinds of fruit, and of balsamic and spice trees, peopled with\r\nbirds of luxuriant plumage or of alimentary utility, would, with the\r\naddition of that agricultural and commercial improvement of which it is\r\nso immensely susceptible, and the introduction of literature, science,\r\nand art, and the consequent prevalence of a social, liberal, and\r\nhospitable feeling, advance it to a state of beauty, prosperity, and\r\nhappiness not to be surpassed by any other portions of the globe, and\r\nequalled but by few.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that at present these numerous provinces, each of which\r\nmight, when thus improved, constitute a kingdom, are mainly in a\r\nprimeval state, and hitherto the religious bigotry, the unlettered\r\nignorance, the unsocial manners, the commercial defects, the narrow,\r\ncivil, and ecclesiastical polity have for centuries checked the natural\r\ngrowth of every thing that adorns and gives power to an empire.\r\n\r\nBut a nobler view of this fine country is rising before us. The\r\nadoption by the Brazilians of the free constitution of government\r\nrecently determined upon by the mother country, and sanctioned by the\r\nbeneficent disposition of their monarch, as well as by the highly\r\nhonourable, judicious, and decided approbation of the Prince Royal,\r\nwill, it is hoped, rouze the latent energies of this fine country, and\r\nproduce an immediate advance towards that flourishing and distinguished\r\nstate we have been contemplating. Indeed it cannot be otherwise if the\r\nconstitution is adopted with stability and energy; for liberty, civil\r\nand religious, is richly productive of every thing that is honourable\r\nand beneficial to mankind, and those have been the most truly glorious\r\nwho have enjoyed it most, giving, as it does to man, when wisely\r\ntempered, an open and happy countenance and heart, and a firm and erect\r\nattitude, step, and character. Such has been Greece in ancient and such\r\nis Britain in modern times.\r\n\r\nThe want of similar blessings in the Brazil has greatly paralysed\r\nindustry in the pursuits of husbandry and commerce, engendered apathy,\r\nand an almost total depression of any desire to emerge from a state of\r\nprofound ignorance in literature and the arts. Education, partially\r\nderived from Royal professors, whose pompous denominations are a\r\nmockery upon learning, will now surely soar to excellence, by means of\r\nthe establishment of seminaries of learning, with professors of real\r\ntalent. The diffusion of knowledge, and the interest which a share\r\nin a popular constitution will give the people in their government,\r\nwill change their listless character into one of life and energy. The\r\namelioration of the laws respecting property in land, the adoption\r\nof new regulations in favour of commerce, and the curtailing the\r\nmind-degrading and extortionate influence of a numerous and slothful\r\npriesthood, will give the Brazilians the desire and the power of giving\r\neffect to the immense physical means of felicity and glory afforded by\r\na country so extraordinarily favoured by nature.\r\n\r\nWhen so barren, so foggy, so unproductive, and so small a country as\r\nHolland, has rendered itself so rich and distinguished among European\r\nstates, infinitely more blessed by nature, what may not be anticipated\r\nof a land so immense, so luxuriant in soil, and so favourable in\r\nclimate as the Brazil, capable as it is of largely producing almost\r\nwhatever nature has bestowed upon other countries. What may not be\r\nanticipated now that such a land has exchanged slavery for freedom.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher, the man of business, and the philanthropist, already\r\nexult in the change, and are felicitated by the prospect so richly\r\nand grandly opening before them. To the first, improved facilities\r\nwill be afforded, in one of the most magnificent and varied fields\r\nin the world, for his delightful pursuits in Natural History. To\r\nthe British merchant particularly an immense augmentation of his\r\ncommercial dealings will be opened, by a wiser administration of the\r\nBrazilian government relative to the exchange of commodities with\r\nother countries, and by the increased industry and prosperity of the\r\nBrazilian people. The well-wisher to the happiness of his fellow\r\nmen will be cheered with the prospect of the gradual if not speedy\r\nabolition of the hateful slave-trade; thus conferring the enjoyment\r\nof freedom not only upon their sable brethren in South America, but\r\ncutting off one of the main sources of the wars, slavery, and misery\r\nof the people of Africa. The revered names of Clarkson and Wilberforce\r\nwill then sound as gratefully as they now do odiously to the Brazilian\r\nplanter and dealer, who at present, from a prejudiced and narrow\r\nconception of what best contributes to the prosperity of individuals\r\nand of nations, and from an ignorant and ill-founded notion of the\r\nfaculties of the negro, misconceive the labours of those excellent\r\nmen. The picture which we have drawn of the future advancement of\r\nthis country permits us also to indulge the hope that the blessings\r\nof civilization will be carried with Jesuitical earnestness among the\r\nnumerous untamed Indians, and that the envenomed dart, rudely-painted\r\nskin, and distorted features, will give place to the customs of social\r\nlife, thereby converting their native wilds into scenes of fertility,\r\nsuch as formerly beautified the missions of Paraguay, where groves of\r\nfruit trees, where sweetest plants and flowers, plantations of roots,\r\nof rice, and Indian corn, numerous useful animals, together with a mild\r\npaternal government, ensured plenty and prosperity to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe king sailed from Rio de Janeiro for Lisbon on the 26th of April,\r\n1821, and arrived at the latter city the beginning of July, accompanied\r\nby upwards of four thousand persons, which will tend to produce a\r\ntemporary depression of the commercial spirit and consequence of the\r\nBrazilian capital. When it is known, however, that a considerable\r\nportion of those individuals were hangers-on upon the royal bounty, and\r\nthat a great many others were not permanent residents, but merely drawn\r\nthither from Portugal, for a certain period, to obtain some object with\r\nthe government, (and from the known partiality of the king in detaining\r\nEuropean Portuguese in the Brazil, the number under those circumstances\r\nwere always considerable,) the impression will be diminished of any\r\nlengthened or serious check upon the prosperity of this city by their\r\nremoval. It will be gratifying to the Brazilians to have still amongst\r\nthem the Conde dos Arcos, who fulfilled the duties of viceroy, on the\r\narrival of the royal family at the Brazil, to the general satisfaction\r\nof the people, and who is appointed prime-minister to His Royal\r\nHighness Don Pedro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\n   _All the Species of Domestic Animals of the South of Europe here\r\n          become more Prolific than in their native Country._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WILD QUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\nThe ANTA, which the Aborigines call _Tapira_, and _Tapijerete_, is\r\nthe largest of the Brazilian quadrupeds, and does not belong to any\r\nknown species, constituting of itself a distinct one in the history\r\nof animals. It is the size of a small heifer, and very similar to a\r\nhog in the figure of its body as well as in the shape of the ears,\r\nwhich are proportioned to its size. The hair is short and sleek; the\r\nlegs are very thick and short; the hind feet have three hoofs and the\r\nfront feet four; the tail is of a tapering form, with little more than\r\nthree inches in length; the head is large and long; the eyes small;\r\nthe upper lip is a musculous appendage, which the animal extends four\r\ninches beyond the lower one, or draws it in to the same length; the\r\nmouth is furnished with eight pointed teeth in each jaw, ten grinders\r\nin the lower, and fourteen in the upper. It pastures like a horse; and,\r\nalthough heavy, has considerable velocity in its career. It is timid\r\nand harmless, doing no injury even to the dog which pursues it. Being\r\namphibious, it swims and dives in an extraordinary manner, and proceeds\r\nalong the bottom of deep pools for a great distance, remaining for a\r\nlong time under water without respiring. Its flesh differs from that of\r\nthe ox only in taste and smell, and is eaten generally. It is of all\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nThere are three sorts of MOUNTAIN BOARS; some are entirely black, some\r\nhave the under jaw white, others, of a small size and gray, are call\r\n_Caitetus_: these become domesticated so as to accompany their master\r\nthrough the streets, without ever leaving him. Their flesh is not of\r\nsuch good flavour as that of the wild boar in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe CACHORO D’AGUA (Water Dog) is small and web-footed, its tail\r\nis long and flat, and its hair exceedingly smooth and fine. It is\r\namphibious, and goes almost always in the water, where it is said to be\r\nso ferocious that it kills ounces when they are swimming across rivers.\r\nWhen caught, it may be domesticated; but it never ceases to utter\r\nlamentations. It is only met with in the central rivers of the Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe CAO SILVESTRE, or _Cachorro do Matto_, (Wild Dog,) is small and\r\nstrong, of a dark or ash colour, with a keen scent. It is a constant\r\npersecutor of the deer, and is said to be met with only in the southern\r\nparts of the river Contas.\r\n\r\nThe CAPIBARA has the figure and size of a hog, short ears, the snout\r\nand teeth of a hare, thin and coarse hair, and large membranes between\r\nthe hoofs. It always keeps near the water, is a great swimmer, and is\r\nmischievous: few people eat its flesh.\r\n\r\nThere are three sorts of MOUNTAIN CATS. The gray ones are denominated\r\n_mariscos_, the red and spotted ones _maracaias_. The latter are very\r\nlarge, and not always harmless.\r\n\r\nThe CAXINGLE is much larger than a squirrel, with little hair upon the\r\ntail, and of a gray colour; it seldom puts its feet upon the ground,\r\nbut leaps from one branch to another, and thus traverses immense woods;\r\nis harmless, and lives upon fruits.\r\n\r\nThe COELHO, or Rabbit, differs only from that of Europe in having a\r\nshorter tail, and is not very numerous.\r\n\r\nThe COTIA is two spans in length, with long legs, small ears, the\r\nsnout of a rabbit, hair strong and of a red colour, with scarcely any\r\nappearance of a tail. After being domesticated it proceeds into the\r\nfields, and returns again. Its flesh is dry and hard.\r\n\r\nThe CUICA is a species of amphibious rat, speckled with white and\r\nblack, having a tail without hair. It eats fish and such birds as it\r\ncan catch.\r\n\r\nThe CUIM is about the size of a leveret, has short feet, a long tail,\r\nand the snout of a squirrel. It is entirely covered with hair, and with\r\nprickles like pins, which defend it from other animals. It runs little,\r\nand lives on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe GUARA has the figure of a wolf, and differs from it triflingly in\r\nthe marks of its skin. It is only met with in the central provinces\r\nof Brazil, where it is not numerously seen nor so destructive as its\r\nspecies in Europe. It is, however, a great enemy to young calves: in\r\nsome parts it is called a wolf; its skin and teeth are much esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe GUARACAO is a species of large and wild dog, which does not\r\nconfound or mix itself with any other of its kind.\r\n\r\nThe GUARAXAIM is also a species of dog, about the size of a cat, and\r\nlives in subterraneous caverns, or burrows, which it forms expressly\r\nfor its habitation. Every thing that it meets with in the _campo_,\r\n(field,) although not eatable, such as a hat or a handkerchief, it will\r\ndrag to the door of its dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe GUAXINIM is a species of fox, with a short and thick snout, feet\r\nrather long and open, and the breast large or full. It abounds most in\r\nthe vicinity of the sea, and descends to the beach to procure crab-fish.\r\n\r\nThe HIRARA, in some provinces called _Papamel_, has the appearance\r\nof a monkey seen at a distance. It is three spans in length, sharp\r\nsnouted, with short legs, and a long tail; of a dark colour, with an\r\nash coloured head; but it does not retain these colours in all the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nThe IAGUANE is a species of small dog, marked with straight lines.\r\n\r\nThe JARATICACA, or _Cangamba_, as it is called in some provinces, and\r\nwhich some consider of a species of pole-cat, resembles the _squash_ of\r\nNorth America, and is remarkable, not only for its beautiful figure,\r\nits white and black spots, and shaggy tail, but for its singular and\r\ninvincible power of defence, which it uses with facility against every\r\nenemy. This animal, on being assaulted, and sometimes before, emits a\r\nportion of urine so extraordinarily loathsome that the aggressor thinks\r\nonly of the mode of deliverance from it. The dogs rub their noses in\r\nthe earth, and men are earnestly desirous to free themselves from\r\ntheir clothes, which retain the odious smell. Occasionally some are\r\nkilled before they use this defence, or unexpectedly before they see\r\ntheir enemy, or at a distance when they do not anticipate the hunter.\r\nA naturalist, who dissected the _Jaraticaca_, found near the urinal\r\nvessel a small receptacle of water, totally distinct from that of\r\nthe bladder, and was persuaded that the fetid matter proceeded from\r\nthence. The fat of this animal, applied externally, is a very powerful\r\nemollient, and the flesh is said to have a good flavour when not\r\ninfected with the fetid water; the skin is used for pockets: it passes\r\nfor the civet-cat.\r\n\r\nThe LONTRA, or OTTER, is an amphibious animal, much larger than that\r\nof Europe, equally voracious and gluttonous of fish. The hair is red,\r\nshort, and thick, and the skin esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe MOCO differs only from the Rabbit in having neither ears nor tail,\r\nand is only met with where there are rocks, in the cavities of which\r\nit forms its dwelling-place. It is easily domesticated, and then it\r\nbecomes daring, and will ill-treat and even make the dogs fly. It is a\r\nmortal enemy to rats, even more destructive to them than the cat. It is\r\nnaturally extremely turbulent and treacherous, but without sagacity to\r\nexecute its evil designs, falling a prey to its own temerity. The life\r\nof this animal is generally short.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous species of the MONKEY, distinguished only by the\r\nsize and colour of the hair. Those called by the Brazilians _Guaribas_\r\ngenerally proceed in bands, and, for the most part, along the branches\r\nof trees, where the whole body make a noise that is heard two miles\r\noff. The _Sahuins_, some of which are the size of a rat, are handsome,\r\nand esteemed for the white plumes or tufts that grow out of the ears.\r\nOf those called _Barbados_, the male has a sort of cup, formed of bone,\r\nin the throat, which produces a loud and hoarse sound. Amongst others\r\nwe may notice those that have no regular dwelling-places, and do not\r\nput their feet in water. They pass rivers, forming a chain by holding\r\nfast to each other, but if they should happen to fall into the water\r\nthey can swim like other quadrupeds. When they are on an excursion to\r\nrob the corn fields of maize, one is always stationed as centinel, in a\r\nproper place to discover the approach of the hunter. They have only one\r\nat a birth, which they carry upon the back with them for some days.\r\n\r\nThe ONCA, or OUNCE, is a species of immense cat, of terrible aspect,\r\nwith a frightful yell, or roar. The largest is about twelve feet in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThere are five different kinds. Some of a dark colour, with small\r\nbrilliant jet black spots, denominated the _Tiger_; others spotted with\r\nblack and white, or yellow, displaying much symmetry, and are properly\r\ncalled _Ounces, or Panthers_; a third, with very small speckles; a\r\nfourth with larger spots, called _Canguçus_; others, of a reddish\r\ncolour, are the smallest, and are called _Sucuarannas_; the last only\r\nattack young cattle and small animals, but the former kill a horse or\r\nan ox in a moment. A bull grown to full maturity is the only quadruped\r\nwhich resists and is not alarmed at this forocious animal.\r\n\r\nThe hunting of the _Ounce_ is less laborious but more dangerous than\r\nthat of the Anta. The Brazilians generally hunt it in large parties,\r\nwell armed with guns, lances, and pitchforks, always accompanied with\r\ndogs, and the greater the number less dangerous is the chase. Although\r\nthis beast is much larger, possesses incomparably greater strength, and\r\nis infinitely swifter than the dog, for which it has a mortal hatred,\r\non seeing one it always retires, as if having a presentiment of the\r\napproach of the hunters. It does not proceed far till it climbs a tree,\r\nor, if hard pressed, makes a terrible braying, and furiously attempts\r\nto catch some of the dogs, and if one comes within reach of its paws\r\nit has not much chance of escape. If the hunter does not take his aim\r\nwell, so as to kill the _Ounce_ upon the spot, it flies directly to the\r\nplace where the smoke came from, and his fate is inevitable, unless\r\nhis companions destroy it with their arms, or he is prepared with a\r\nlance to despatch it when it makes the last spring. It seizes upon its\r\nprey first with the paws and then with the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe PACA is a heavy creeping quadruped, little more than two spans\r\nin length, without a tail, having small ears, the snout of a rabbit,\r\ncoarse strong hair, and is of a reddish colour, with small white spots\r\nalong the sides, and streaked with the same colour along the back.\r\nIt is the best game of the country, and is divested of its hair and\r\nprepared for the table similarly to a sucking pig.\r\n\r\nThe PORCO-ESPIM, or _Porcupine_, is of the size of a cat, with a long\r\ntail, and covered with long sharp-pointed quills, but its head has a\r\ngreater resemblance to that of a dog. It is most numerous near the\r\ncentral rivers.\r\n\r\nThe PREGUICA, or _Sloth_, is a stout short quadruped; very lazy;\r\ncovered with long thick hair; having stout legs armed with large paws;\r\na small head, and round physiognomy, with some similarity to a monkey\r\nwithout ears or tail, and climbs trees. It subsists upon leaves. Its\r\nextreme slowness gives rise to its name. It is asserted in the Poem of\r\nCaramura that it possesses this tardy propensity to such a degree that\r\nin a few paces it consumes a whole day.[45]\r\n\r\nThe PREHA is of the size and colour of a leveret, with the snout more\r\nrounded; the ears are very small and membranous, and it is without a\r\ntail. It can swim small brooks and rivers, and is esteemed good eating,\r\nparticularly by the negroes.\r\n\r\nThe QUATI is very similar to a fox, at the first sight, chiefly in\r\nthe head, but its ears are shorter, rounder, and less hairy. Its\r\nhair is also long, thick, and soft, like the fox, of which it has\r\nthe physiognomy. The legs are short and thick, the feet long, with\r\nfive toes, furnished with claws, with which it climbs trees and digs\r\nup insects. The tail is long and round, gradually growing smaller to\r\nthe extremity, and varied with a succession of rings; the mouth is\r\nlong, becoming smaller towards the extremity, like that of a hog; the\r\nmouth is large, with teeth similar to those of a dog; the under jaw is\r\nalmost an inch and a half shorter than the upper. This animal may be\r\nso domesticated that it will accompany its master into the _campos_\r\nlike a little dog; but its natural restlessness requires it generally\r\nto be confined. There are two sorts of this quadruped, differing only\r\nin size. The small class always proceed in bands, and are called\r\n_quati-monde_.\r\n\r\nThe ROPOZA, or _Fox_, is less than that of Europe, equally subtle, and\r\neven more destructive in the damage it does to the cane plantations and\r\nmelons. Its skin is used only for housings.\r\n\r\nAmongst the various races of RATS is the _Rato de Espinho_, (_the\r\nPrickly Rat_,) which is large, white bellied, its upper part\r\nash-coloured, and its sides furnished with prickles. It is agreeable to\r\nthe sight, without smell, and its flesh is esteemed good.\r\n\r\nThe SAROHE, or _Gamba_, a species of the _Oppossum_, is as large as a\r\nmiddle sized cat, with the form of a rat, of a disagreeable aspect and\r\nnauseous smell; the legs are short; the feet and ears like a rat; its\r\nhair is thin, long, and sleek; the tail long, becoming small towards\r\nthe end, and without hair. It has the head and snout of a pig, a\r\nlarge mouth, with the teeth of a dog. This animal is one of the most\r\nremarkable objects in Natural History in consequence of a second belly,\r\nor womb, which it has below the upper or natural one, with an opening,\r\nor mouth, at the fore part, within which it carries its young till they\r\narrive at an age to procure their own subsistence. Some say that this\r\nquadruped engenders and brings forth its young like other animals,\r\nand, after their birth puts them into this sack, where, in fact, they\r\ncan only obtain suck, the mother only having teats in the upper belly.\r\nOthers pretend that the young organize themselves by being attached to\r\nthe dugs, from whence, at maturity, they fall into the sack. It is,\r\nhowever, certain that the young are found drawing nourishment from the\r\npaps of the mother, by which they are suspended and cling firmly to\r\nthem, even when without hair and very small. They are great destroyers\r\nof poultry, and passionately fond of cachaca, or rum, with which they\r\nare easily caught, as they soon become intoxicated.\r\n\r\nThe SAVIA is like a leveret, with hair similar to that of a hare, and\r\na long tail; breeds in holes or pits; eats fruit; and is much esteemed\r\nfor its flesh. It is thought to be a species of the _caxingle_.\r\n\r\nThere are two breeds of TAMANDUHAS, or _Ant-Bears_, small and large.\r\nThe larger, called _Tamanduha-bandeira_, is of the bigness of a\r\nmiddling sized hog, to which it assimilates in the body, having the\r\nbristles of a wild boar, black and thick, with gray marks on each\r\nside; the ears are round and extremely small; the snout very long and\r\ntapering, having the appearance at its termination of that of a lamb;\r\nits mouth is very small and without teeth; the tongue exceedingly long\r\nand narrow, with which it catches the _Cupim-ant_, its only aliment;\r\nthe tail is long and shaggy, and curled back towards the neck from\r\nwhence its name is derived, (_bandeira_, flag or ensign;) it has\r\nshort and very thick legs with five toes on each foot, each toe being\r\nfurnished with a short and thick claw. It imprints a foot-mark like a\r\nchild’s, runs little, scarcely makes any exertion to escape from its\r\naggressor, and when irritated will advance against a man; but it is\r\nonly necessary to give it a blow upon the snout and it falls dead on\r\nthe ground. When it perceives itself attacked it lies on its back and\r\nwaits for the enemy, which on drawing near, it instantly fastens upon,\r\nand will never leave its hold unless the tendons of its legs are cut.\r\n_Ounces_ have been found dead with _Tamanduhas_, firmly fastened to\r\neach other. For hunting this animal, the flesh of which is insipid but\r\nmedicinal in certain diseases, it is necessary to have a dog that will\r\ntrace its track, but, in order not to run any risk, it is necessary\r\nthat it should be timorous and cautious.\r\n\r\nThe TATU, or _Armadillo_, of which there are various sorts, differing\r\nonly in the size and the number of bands of shells which cover them,\r\nis of a wonderful figure; the head and ears are similar to those of a\r\npig, the eyes small, the snout long and pointed, the mouth small, the\r\ntail long, somewhat similar to the tail of a rat. The legs are short,\r\nand the feet are furnished with large and strong claws, with which\r\nthey can burrow a hole in the ground, for their safety, almost in an\r\ninstant. This quadruped is covered with a coat of mail, which in its\r\nconformation is one of the most extraordinary phenomena in Natural\r\nHistory. The body is dressed in shells, disposed one over the other\r\nas in the tail of a lobster, and forms a sort of housing cloth, that\r\nconceals the belly; the whole uncovered with hair, and black. Some of\r\nthe kinds, when danger is near, can roll themselves up entirely in\r\nthe shell, like a hedge hog, but others not so completely. That kind\r\ndenominated _Tatuim_, or _Tatuette_, is small. The _Verdadeiro_ is\r\nlarger, and its flesh good,. The _Peba_ has a flat head. The _Canastra_\r\nis of the size of a pig, and its flesh unwholesome. The BOLA, (or\r\n_Ball_,) so called in the Brazil, in consequence of concealing all its\r\nmembers under its shell, is of a whitish colour, and its flesh of good\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\nThere are five sorts of DEER, _Galheiros_, which are large;\r\n_Sucuaparas_, _do mato_ (of the woods;) _Catingueiros_[46] and\r\n_Campeiros_.[47]\r\n\r\nThe amphibious monster, with the figure of a lizard, resembling the\r\ncrocodile in Africa and Asia, has, in the Brazil, the name of JACARE,\r\nor _Aligator_, and is met with in all the lakes and rivers of tranquil\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Brazil abound with a great number of LAND TORTOISES,\r\nwhich never enter the water; their flesh is of fine flavour, and the\r\nliver is considered delicious.\r\n\r\nMan has less to fear from wild beasts in the Brazil than from reptiles,\r\nthe species of which are various, and some exceedingly numerous and\r\ngenerally venomous.\r\n\r\nThe SUCURIUBA are affirmed to grow to the extraordinary length of\r\nforty feet, and are confined to lakes and pools of dead water, firmly\r\nattaching its tail to a root, or the point of a stone at the bottom of\r\nthe water; it seizes all living animals that approach the margin, and\r\nswallows the whole, as a snake in Europe would a mouse or any small\r\nanimal. It makes a hollow noise below the water, on hearing any sound\r\nfrom without: the otter is its greatest enemy.\r\n\r\nThe SURUCUCU, or _Surroco_, seldom exceeds fifteen feet in length,\r\nis of proportionable width, and usually met with in cool and shady\r\nplaces. Its tail is armed with two spears, and its bite is cured with\r\ndifficulty. Its skin is marked with great symmetry, and is of an ash\r\ncolour, with brownish spots, and covered with scales.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1819, a gentleman accompanied by six other persons\r\narrived one evening upon the margins of a lake, near the river Pardo,\r\nin the province of St. Paulo, where they dismounted to take some\r\nrepose. They perceived at a short distance what they supposed to be the\r\ntrunk of a tree, which shortly afterwards began to move; the contents\r\nof a gun was immediately discharged at it, and they then despatched\r\nit with their knives. It was a SERPENT of the _surucucu_ species, and\r\nthe gentleman above mentioned assured me that it measured twenty-one\r\nfeet in length, and four in girth. He had a variety of articles besides\r\nseveral pairs of boots made from its skin, in the city of St. Paulo,\r\none pair of which I brought with me to England. The torpid state which\r\nthis serpent at first exhibited, arose from its having recently gorged\r\na young bull.\r\n\r\nThe JIBOIA, which is scarcely distinguishable from the preceding\r\nserpent in size or colour, has no spears to its tail, nor does it bite.\r\nWhen it seizes any living creature it is always for the purpose of\r\neating it. It never attacks its prey without first winding its tail\r\nround the trunk of a tree, in order that its prisoner may not drag it\r\naway, and, after having fatigued it by its first attack, it then draws\r\nitself so closely round the animal that it breaks its bones and kills\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe COBRA, of Cascavel, or _Rattle Snake_, is so called in consequence\r\nof its tail terminating with some similitude to the husks of a species\r\nof dried pulse. It has scarcely the thickness of a man’s leg, with\r\nproportionable length. It never bites without beating three times with\r\nits cascavel, or rattle, upon the ground, and its bite is almost always\r\nfatal. It is said that the number of the divisions of the tail is equal\r\nto the age in years of this snake. The snake _caninana_ is very long,\r\nof a slender form, black and spotted with yellow. The _jararaca_ is\r\na species the most numerous, and its bite is fatal. That denominated\r\nthe _cauda-branca_ (white tail) is not more than a span in length,\r\nand there is yet no known antidote against its venom. The living\r\ncreature that has the misfortune to be stung by it immediately becomes\r\nconvulsed, sweats blood, and expires in a short time. The _jararacucu_\r\nis of a deep green colour, of considerable length, and slender. Its\r\nbite is generally mortal.\r\n\r\nThe COBRA DE CORAL (_Coral Serpent_) is small, of slender form,\r\nvenomous, and beautified with rings of various colours.\r\n\r\nDUAS CABECAS, (_Two Heads_,) so called because all its length is of the\r\nsame thickness. It is also venomous. It is said that the best antidote\r\nfor its bite is to eat the liver of the said snake.\r\n\r\nThe COBRA VERDE, or _Green Serpent_, is of little length, and very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe PAPAPINTOS is a large gray snake, said to be harmless. It is seldom\r\nmet with but upon the margins or in the vicinity of lakes, where it\r\ncatches toads and rats.\r\n\r\nThere is another species of serpent, called by the Brazilians\r\nCAMPO-LIMPA, (_Field Cleaner_,) in consequence of its cleaning the\r\nfields of the smaller snakes. It is light coloured, with a yellowish\r\ncast, ornamented with a variety of spots, and is about six feet long.\r\nAlmost all these species of snakes are said to be viviparous.\r\n\r\nThe Padre Manoel Ayres de Cazal says, that in the parish of Muritiba,\r\nnear Cachoeira, in the province of Bahia, a serpent was shown to him,\r\nkilled within an hour, as a curiosity, in consequence of being wholly\r\nunknown to the people. It was scarcely a foot in length, but thick and\r\nround, and smooth as an eel, to which its head assimilated. The tail\r\nwas short and pointed in a pyramidical form. It had four feet extremely\r\nsmall, without any appearance of legs.\r\n\r\nIn the Brazil there are various species of SPIDERS, which furnish\r\nexcellent silk.\r\n\r\nThe CARANQUEJEIRA, so denominated in consequence of being of the size\r\nof a moderate sized _caranguejo_, or crab-fish, is covered with long\r\nhair, and is venomous.\r\n\r\nThe CIGARRA, or _Cricket_, has more of the species of beetle than the\r\nlocust.\r\n\r\nThe species of BUTTERFLIES are here very numerous, as I have before\r\nobserved. A collection of sixteen hundred different sorts has already\r\nbeen made in the Brazil, and unquestionably there are an infinite\r\nnumber yet for collection to occupy the industry of the naturalist.\r\nThe most beautiful are found in the vicinity of the tropic and the\r\ntemperate zone.\r\n\r\nThere are also a great variety of flies and phosphoric insects, which\r\nilluminate the hedges at night by the brilliant lights they emit.\r\n\r\nThere are also a great diversity of ANTS. The most remarkable are\r\nthose of Mandioca, of Correiçao, and the Cupim. The first are of a\r\nreddish colour, and a pest to agricultural productions, as well as\r\nfruit trees, such as the orange, and others equal in size or larger.\r\nIt is necessary every day, in order to preserve the mandioca from the\r\ndestructive attacks of this insect, to lay something for them to eat,\r\nin order that they may not devour the plantations at night or strip\r\nthe trees of their foliage. It is during the night alone that they\r\ncommit these depredations. They form spacious subterraneous cavities,\r\nwith many entrances and outlets, distant one from the other. When it\r\nhappens that they form this cavity below the foundation-wall of a\r\nhouse sometimes it sinks, and, during the rainy season, most probably\r\nfalls to the ground. The Correiçao[48] Ant is small, and moves from\r\none district to another in innumerable legions, covering many roods\r\nof territory in their march. No living insect can remain upon their\r\nline of march: the smaller ones are killed, and the larger obliged to\r\nfly. The Cupim is a small Ant, light coloured, and flat, subsisting\r\nupon the flour or small particles of wood, with which, and a species\r\nof glue that issues from its body, it constructs an arch or vault over\r\nthe road by which it travels, in order that it may not be seen by other\r\ninsects and birds which destroy it. It is very destructive to the\r\ntimbers of dwelling-houses, and builds its residence in the ceilings\r\nof the same materials, in a round form full of little cells; sometimes\r\nit constructs it upon the points of branches of trees, but the greater\r\nnumber of Cupims erect them upon the ground, with earth, rendered solid\r\nby the admixture of the said glue, the whole of the interior being\r\nfull of cells, saloons, and covered ways: their form is pyramidical,\r\nsome with many feet in height, and they resist for several winters\r\nthe tempests of rain that assail them; but the claws of the ant-bear\r\ncrumble them to dust in a moment, when their inhabitants are as quickly\r\ndevoured.\r\n\r\nThere are divers species of the BEE, but none of them can be compared\r\nwith the European bee in the utility and excellence of its honey.\r\n\r\nThat called _Urucu_ is the most numerous, and of a gray colour. Its\r\nhive is of wood, and the door is an orifice by which one can pass\r\ncommodiously at a time, and where there is always one upon the watch,\r\nwith its head out, in order to impede the entrance of small insects.\r\nThis sentinel is subject to the inconvenience of drawing back upon the\r\nentrance or going out of any one of the commonwealth. The _mumbuca_ is\r\nof a blackish colour. The _mandassaia_ is black and short. These three\r\nkinds are of the size of the European bee. The _tubim_ is smaller.\r\nThe _theuba_ is also small, and of a yellow cast. The _cupimeira_,\r\nso denominated because it occupies the houses deserted by the Cupim\r\nant, makes good honey. The _tatahira_ and the _saranho_ are the only\r\nspecies that are mordacious. The _getahi_ is of the size of a mosquito,\r\nand manufactures a honey of a very liquid and delicious nature. The\r\n_caruara_ is a little larger than the preceding. The _pregiuçoza_ is\r\nof the size of the getahi, and produces an insipid honey. That named\r\n_mosquitinho_ is very small and black, and lives on the ground. None\r\nof these species form the honey-comb like those of Europe; the combs\r\nare round, and the cells unequal, in the form of a bubble, without\r\nregularity, and the wax is more or less glutinous, and never has the\r\nwhiteness of that of the old world. All the bee-hives, of whatever\r\nspecies of bees they are, have few inhabitants, comparatively speaking.\r\n\r\nThere are also various casts of WASPS, or _Morimbondos_, as they\r\nare called in the country. The _inxuy_ is delicate, and makes its\r\nhabitation generally of a round form, plain, and of an ash colour,\r\nattached to a branch, or fastened to some plant; its combs are deep,\r\nand introduced one into the other, the orifices or cells are full of a\r\nyellow savoury honey, which ultimately becomes like refined sugar. The\r\n_inxu_ is large, fabricates its combs according to the method of the\r\npreceding, and fills them with most excellent honey.\r\n\r\nIf the Brazil cannot boast of so great a variety of quadrupeds as\r\nsome countries, perhaps no other region of the world equals it in the\r\ninnumerable species of birds which it possesses, more wonderful still\r\nin the beauty of their plumage and variety of their song.\r\n\r\nAmongst them are those which follow, namely: --\r\n\r\nThe ALMA DE GATO (_Soul of a Cat_) is of the size of a pigeon, the\r\nlower part ash-coloured, and the upper of a gold colour, with a long\r\ntail, short and curved beak. It has no song.\r\n\r\nThere are various kinds of ANDORINHAS, or _Swallows_, distinguished\r\nalone by the size or the colour, being more or less black.\r\n\r\nThe ANUM is of the size of a blackbird, the whole of a brilliant and\r\njet black, the tail long and rounded, with only eight feathers. The\r\nbill curved, thick at the root, and the upper part pointed. Its song is\r\na kind of sad lamentation; and its flight is short. They always proceed\r\nin flocks not very numerous, and never alight upon high trees. It is\r\nsaid that these flocks all lay their eggs in one common nest. It is,\r\nhowever, certain, that if the nest of these birds is found with a great\r\nnumber of eggs, there are numerous compartments, and the various little\r\nnests are separated by portions of dried grass. There are other casts\r\nof the Anum, of the size of the preceding one, but of an ash-colour,\r\nwith a slender beak, a little curved, and a tuft or plume of feathers,\r\nwhich it elevates and lowers at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe ARAPONGA, or _Guiraponga_, is of the size of a small pigeon, white\r\nas snow, with a beak wide at the root, a portion unfeathered, and of a\r\ngreen colour around the eyes. This bird perches upon the top of the\r\nhighest trees in the woods, and there passes the principal part of the\r\nday in a song, which imitates well a farrier just finishing a horse’s\r\nshoe upon the anvil.\r\n\r\nAZULAO is a species of sparrow, of an indigo-colour, which, after being\r\naccustomed to the cage, imitates various other small birds.\r\n\r\nBEMTEVI, so called by the Europeans in consequence of its articulating\r\nwith accuracy the words which compose its name, is the size of a lark,\r\nwith a white circle around the head, a thick and pointed bill, having a\r\nyellow belly, and a gold colour above.\r\n\r\nBICUDO is a kind of sparrow, either of an agate or gold colour, sings,\r\nand has a very short thick bill.\r\n\r\nBARBUDO is little less than a blackbird, also black, with a large white\r\nspot on the back, and a yellow one on the neck, a short tail and legs,\r\na large head, with thick eyebrows, a jet black bill, a little curved\r\nand pointed, having whiskers.\r\n\r\nCABECA DE RUBIM (_Head of Ruby_) is a species of duck, of a green\r\ncolour, with a little crimson cap, which it conceals at pleasure, as\r\nwell as the feathers of its sides. The female has a larger and black\r\ncap.\r\n\r\nCABORE is the small Spanish owl.\r\n\r\nCAIÇU, which signifies large head, is of the size of a lark, of a\r\ndisagreeable aspect, with the wings and tail of a tobacco and the belly\r\nof an ash colour, having a white spot upon the neck, the upper part\r\nof the body gray and speckled with white, a thick neck and bill, the\r\nlatter black pointed.\r\n\r\nCANARIO (_Canary_) has the form, and almost the same colour, but not\r\nthe song of those of the Canary islands. It is the first amongst the\r\nsmall birds that announces the dawn of day.\r\n\r\nCANCAO is of the size of a blackbird, the belly white, the upper part\r\ndark, with a long round tail, and white at the extremity. The fore part\r\nof the head, neck, and breast, are of a jet colour. It has a large\r\nwhite spot upon the back part of the head, a small black crest, a small\r\nround spot above the eyes, beginning with blue and finishing in white;\r\nthe iris is yellow, which it extends and compresses, and the beak thick\r\nand short. This bird always goes near the ground, and on perceiving any\r\nliving creature immediately gives a signal. It is the most choleric\r\nbird of the country, and a destroyer of the others, eating the eggs and\r\nthe young ones whilst unfeathered.\r\n\r\nCARDIAL (_Cardinal_) is a little larger than the linnet, which it\r\nresembles. It has a small crimson cap, or hood, which covers a part\r\nof the neck, and from which it derived the name: its song is loud and\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nCARRICA (_Hedge-sparrow_) differs from that of Europe only in being a\r\nlittle larger, and less fearful. It makes its nest, with little care,\r\nin inhabited houses or the fields.\r\n\r\nCHAMA-COELHO is a little less than the blackbird, with a black head,\r\nthe lower part yellow, and the upper of a tobacco colour.\r\n\r\nCEGONHA, or _Stork_, is common, and similar to that of Europe.\r\n\r\nCAZACA DE COIRO is of the size of a lark, yellow above, and gray under\r\nthe belly.\r\n\r\nCOLHEREIRA, which with justice has the pre-eminence of king amongst\r\nbirds of the morasses, is the size of a large capon, without a tail, of\r\na rose colour above, the belly white, with long legs, long white neck,\r\nthe bill also long and thick at the root, square in the middle, wide\r\nand flat at the point, like a _Spatula_.\r\n\r\nCOLIBRI, or _Humming-bird_, and known in the Brazil only by the name\r\nof _Beija Flor_, (Kiss the Flower,) is the smallest bird existing.\r\nMr. Robert has represented it to be as small as a fly, in which he\r\ndoes not appear to be correct, as none so diminutive are seen in this\r\ncountry. Their varieties have been stated at six or seven, but there\r\nare a great many more: Padre Cazal has seen ten different kinds. An\r\nEuropean would never have supposed that a bird so small as the end of\r\none’s finger could exist, furnished as it is with a bill, feathers,\r\nwings, and intestines, similar to the larger kind, and he would be\r\nnaturally disposed to consider it but a creature of imagination, until\r\nhe visited its native country, and daily beheld it fluttering like a\r\nbutterfly at every flower, and humming a gentle chirrup. It has long\r\nwings compared with the size of the body. The largest, of the size of\r\na very small wren, are of an indigo colour, with a white spot upon the\r\nback. The second species differ only from the first in being smaller\r\nand not having a spot, both have a long tail much forked. The third\r\nkind and size are gray, and make their nests in inhabited houses, in\r\nthe form of a little pocket, suspended from the point of a straw. The\r\nfourth variety are entirely green. The fifth are the same colour and\r\nsize, with a white spot upon the breast. The sixth differs only from\r\nthe preceding in having a very short tail. The seventh is of the same\r\ncolour and size, with the tail yellow. The eighth is the colour of the\r\nnightingale, the breast finely speckled with white. The ninth is of a\r\nbrilliant green, with the wings and tail dark, the beak short, slender,\r\nand yellow. All the others have it long, pointed, very delicate,\r\nand straight, with the exception of the gray ones and those of the\r\nnightingale colour, who have it a little curved. The tenth kind is\r\ndark, or almost black, with a short tail of the colour of fire, the\r\nbill black, and of medium length; when turned towards the spectator,\r\nthe throat and breast exhibit at one instant various colours, according\r\nto the movements of the bird, at one time that of Aurora, when most\r\nbright, or like gold melted in the crucible, followed, on a sudden,\r\nsometimes by a suffusion of green, at others by blue, and by white,\r\nwithout ever losing an inimitable brilliancy. The head, which is black,\r\nappears ornamented with a little crest of the same colour when the bird\r\nhas its side towards the observer, and when it presents the front it\r\nappears studded with sparkling rubies, or all of a brilliant scarlet,\r\nwhich insensibly changes to refulgent yellow. They generally have the\r\ntongue very long, the legs exceedingly short, and the eyes black; their\r\nprincipal aliment is the juice or honey of flowers, which they extract,\r\nnot as the bee but in the same manner as the butterfly. Some of them\r\nhave the tongue cleft.\r\n\r\nEMA, or _Emu_, is the Ostrich of the old world, and is the largest\r\nbird of this country; its body is round, and covered with long gray\r\nfeathers, standing on end; the legs thick and long, with three short\r\nand stout toes; two sort of spears are at the joints of the wings,\r\nwhich are not sufficient to fly with, but in the plains it surpasses\r\nthe horse in swiftness, and is difficult to _laço_, even when the\r\n_laçador_ is mounted upon a fleet horse. It has no tail, and when it\r\nelevates its head it is the height of a man. Its feathers are esteemed\r\nfor plumes, and the skin is used for shoes.\r\n\r\nENCONTRO is the size of a greenfinch, long, delicate, and dark, with a\r\nyellow spot at the joint of the wing. There are two other sorts, of a\r\njet colour, one of which has white spots, and the other red.\r\n\r\nFEITICEIRO is the size of a lark, between yellow and green on the upper\r\npart, the belly ash colour, with the bill of a blackbird, eyes like\r\nrubies, and a small crest,\r\n\r\nGALLEIRAO is the size of a pigeon, the upper part green, and the lower\r\npurple, with a very short tail, long yellow legs, the neck slender,\r\nthe head small, with a flat comb, smooth and white, the bill short and\r\nthick and the colour of red sealing wax, with the extremity yellow.\r\nIt frequents the margins of lakes, and its flesh is savory. There is\r\nanother species of this bird, somewhat varying from it.\r\n\r\nGALLO DO BANDO is the size of a sparrow, black, with a white spot upon\r\nthe back, and the top of the head green, having a long tail. GUARA,\r\none of the handsomest birds that frequent the morasses, has the body\r\nsimilar to a partridge, a long neck and legs, with the bill long and\r\na little curved, and without a tail. The first feathers are white,\r\nafter a short time they turn black, and finally scarlet, preserving the\r\nsecond colour at the extremity of the wings.\r\n\r\nGARCA, or _Heron_, consists of small and large white ones, and also\r\nothers which are large and of an ash colour.\r\n\r\nGAVIAO, or _Hawk_, includes various kinds, of which the Cauhan is\r\nsmall, and the Corocuturu gray, being four spans in length from the\r\nhead to the extremity of the tail, and will seize a small monkey and\r\nfly away with it with great facility.\r\n\r\nGRUNHATA is the size of a robin-red-breast, yellow below and on the\r\nfront of the head, the rest of a dark colour, except some blue parts.\r\nIts song is harmonious. There are other sorts, some of them yellow,\r\nwith the tail and wings green, and a black stroke the whole length of\r\nthe lower part.\r\n\r\nJABURU is larger than the turkey-cock, without a tail, and white as\r\nsnow; the neck, legs, and bill are very long; the latter is pointed.\r\n\r\nJACANAN is little less than the thrush, the breast green, the upper\r\npart of a tobacco colour, with the wings short and round, the tail very\r\nshort, with eight small feathers, the eyes and legs of a rosy hue, a\r\nfine bill, and a green spot on the front part of the head. It goes\r\nalways upon the ground.\r\n\r\nJACU is the size of a large capon, black, with the figure of a\r\nturkey-hen.\r\n\r\nJACUTINGA is a little larger, with the same figure and colour, having\r\ngreen legs, and half of the wings white, a green bill and large black\r\neyes, the feathers on the upper part of the head are long and white,\r\nthe breast is speckled with white.\r\n\r\nJACU-PEMBA is smaller than the first, with the breast of an ash colour.\r\nThe _aracuan_ is also a species of _jacu_, the size of a pigeon, with\r\nthe tail and neck long, of a dark yellowish hue. These four birds have\r\nwattles at the throat similar to a turkey-hen.\r\n\r\nJAPU is the size of a pigeon, black, with a yellow tail, the bill of\r\nthe same colour, thick, long, round, and finely pointed; when it sings\r\nit suspends itself by the feet, at the same time beating with its wings.\r\n\r\nJAPUE is less, and of the same colour, with a large green spot upon the\r\nback, the eyes small and the iris blue. Both construct the same kind\r\nof nests, which are remarkable for the form and for the art with which\r\nthey make them at the extremity of the highest horizontal branches, in\r\nthe shape of a bag or pocket, and five or six spans in length; they\r\nare of moss, woven in such a way that they move continually to and fro\r\nwith the wind, without sustaining any injury. Such is their precaution\r\nto prevent their young from being injured by surrounding enemies. They\r\ndestroy oranges profusely to obtain the seed.\r\n\r\nINHUMA is the size of a capon, with dark sides, the belly ash colour,\r\nand the wings of an extraordinary length, being ten spans when\r\nextended, each with two spurs of an unequal size, and a horn of a\r\nbony substance half a span in length and the thickness of a large\r\nturkey-quil, sharp pointed, and a little curved at the extremity, with\r\na magnetic virtue, and also with the property of counter-poison. When\r\nabout to drink it introduces this antidote against poison into the\r\nwater, and the birds and quadrupeds near it, it is said, then only\r\ndrink. Its flesh is spongy and not eaten. There are other kinds of this\r\nbird about the size of a pigeon.\r\n\r\nJOAO-DE-BARRO is a species of lark, yellow, with a whitish streak\r\nabove the eyes, and only remarkable for the arrangement of its nest\r\nof _burro_, or clay, from which its name is derived. The nest is\r\nconstructed with much art and perfection between the forked branches\r\nof a tree, and consists of a corridor, something more than a span in\r\nlength, having a window at the end, between it and an apartment almost\r\nof the same length at one side, whose entrance is small, and always on\r\nthat side the least exposed to the wind. This edifice withstands the\r\nwinters for many years.\r\n\r\nJOAO TOLO (_Foolish John_) is the size of a bullfinch, of a greenish\r\nchangeable colour above, the belly yellow, with a white spot upon the\r\nthroat, the neck very long, the bill also long and pointed. It is tame,\r\nand without any song.\r\n\r\nLAVANDEIRA is small and white, with the wings black.\r\n\r\nAmongst various sorts of MACARICOS, which inhabit the margins and\r\nlakes, there is one somewhat smaller than the thrush, ash-coloured\r\nabove, and white below, with a very short tail; the legs long and\r\ngreen; the head large and flat, with a narrow white circle around it,\r\nwhich is relieved by another that is wide and black, and a collar of\r\nthe same colour; the eyelids are rosy, with two ferrels or spears at\r\nthe joints of the wings, which are white, with the extremities black.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of the WILD DUCK and WATER FOWL.\r\n\r\nMARIDO-HE-DIA (_Husband it is Day_) does not differ from the female of\r\nthe bird called _tendilhao_ (or chaffinch:) its song is its name badly\r\narticulated.\r\n\r\nMORCEGOS, or Bats, are numerous everywhere, some being of the size of a\r\npigeon; they are exceedingly prejudicial to cattle, to certain fruits,\r\nand to houses and churches, where they frequently discharge a black\r\nliquid that cannot be washed away.\r\n\r\nMUTUN is almost the size of a turkey-cock, of a beautiful jet black,\r\nvery graceful, with a curled tuft or plume, quick eyes, the bill\r\nyellow, the legs green, and the thighs white. Its song is mournful; its\r\nflesh delicious. The female has the plume spotted.\r\n\r\nThere are also different sorts of NIGHT-CROWS (_Noitibos_) or\r\n_Coliangas_, as they are commonly called. One kind frequents the\r\nmargins of lakes during the day, and is of a beautiful and inimitable\r\ngray on the upper part, the lower part white, having a white spot in\r\nthe middle of the wings, the extremities being black. The head is large\r\nand flat, with large black eyes. It has scarcely the appearance of a\r\nbill, with a crooked, and extremely large mouth; the largest toe, which\r\nis not proportioned to the smallness of the others, has a saw or comb\r\ntowards the inner side. The flesh of this bird, when fat, is considered\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nPAHO is the size of a pigeon, black, with the breast of a rosy hue, and\r\nthe beak proportionate. Its flesh is also good when fat.\r\n\r\nPAPA-ARROZ is small and entirely black. It goes in bands.\r\n\r\nThere are upwards of twenty sorts of PARROTS, reckoning from the\r\nsmallest parroquet to the _arara_, or macaw. The flesh of the whole is\r\ndeemed good, especially that of the _juru_. Those which compose the\r\nlast class are of three sorts: the _Araruna_ is entirely blue; the\r\n_Caninde_, also blue above, with the belly of a gold colour; and others\r\nwhich have the lower part and the head of a rose colour.\r\n\r\nIn lakes distant from inhabited places there are large WILD GEESE some\r\ngray, some white, and others coralline.\r\n\r\nThe bird called the PAVAO, or _Peacock_, is of the size of a lark when\r\nunfeathered; but, while feathered, is larger than a thrush. It is of\r\na beautiful, brilliant, and changeable colour, beginning with green,\r\nand finishing with a bluish green upon the back; the belly is of a\r\nrose colour; the wings small and round, and of an exquisite gray; the\r\nlower parts of the thighs are dressed in dark feathers, covering the\r\nlegs, which are very delicate and short; the tail is six inches long,\r\nthe two central feathers are dark and of changeable colour, the four\r\nnext are of a jet black, and all the six equal,--the other six have the\r\nextremities white, and gradually diminishing from the others in length:\r\nthe head is rather large, covered with curled feathers, which form a\r\nlittle plume of dark blue; the bill is very short and a little curved,\r\nextremely wide at the root, and terminating in a point encircled with\r\nmustachoes or foretops thick and black; the eyes are large and black,\r\nwith yellow eyelids.\r\n\r\nThere are five species of PARTRIDGES, all gray, and without tails. The\r\nsmallest, called _nambus_, have a rosy beak; those called _zabelez_ are\r\na little larger than the European partridge, and have the legs yellow;\r\nthe _enapupez_ is still larger, with a long bill; those named _macucos_\r\nare more bulky, and of a dark colour, with two spurs at the joints\r\nof the wings, and a species of saw (such at least have the males)\r\nupon the hinder part of the legs; the _capueiras_, which are a little\r\nlarger than the _nambus_, go in bands: all the others disperse after\r\nthe mothers leave them. The whole sit upon the ground, excepting the\r\n_macuco_, which always perches upon a tree at night.\r\n\r\nPERU DO MATO, (the Wood Turkey,) improperly so called, is the size of\r\na blackbird, of a dark ash colour, well furnished with feathers, which\r\nterminate like hair, the tail jet black, the bill red, thick, and\r\npointed; when it sings it elevates the beak perpendicularly.\r\n\r\nQUEROQUERO, which is almost the size of a partridge, has a white\r\nbelly, with the breast and throat white, of a changeable colour above,\r\nwith a white spot near the wings, which are armed with two spurs, and\r\nwhose largest feathers are black, much exceeding the length of the\r\ntail, which is short, with the extremity white, the eyes are green\r\nand handsome, it has the bill similar to a pigeon, green, and the end\r\nblack; the head is ornamented with a small black crest, and pointed;\r\nthe legs are long, and the thighs still longer, with the lower portion\r\nunfeathered and green. Its flesh is good, and it would appear not to\r\nsleep, as its cry is heard at all hours of the night. It feeds upon the\r\nmargins of lakes.\r\n\r\nThe ROLA, or sort of _Turtle-Dove_, is of various species: those\r\ncalled _juritis_ are a little less than a similar kind which pass from\r\nAfrica to Europe in the spring, but are not so handsome; their song,\r\nconsisting of one long note, is somewhat melancholy; those called\r\n_turtles de cascavel_, in consequence of the rattling of their wings\r\nwhen they rise, are beautified with white spots, and are somewhat\r\nlarger than a sparrow, they fight with their wings, and commonly\r\nprocure their sustenance in bands. The third kind, called _coboclas_,\r\nfrom being the colour of a brick, are the same size as the preceding.\r\nThe other sorts all pass under the name of _pombas_ (pigeons); the\r\n_cardigueras_ are small; those called _aza branca_ (white wing)\r\nresemble the _troquaze_ pigeon, or ring dove of Europe. The ring doves\r\nof the country are large, and have their beaks green; as have also\r\nthose called _pararis_.\r\n\r\nSABIA is a kind of thrush, and the greatest singer in the Brazil; its\r\nsong does not differ from the blackbird; some, but very rarely, have\r\nthe feathers and the bill yellow.\r\n\r\nThe SAHYS are a species of beautiful little bird, and divided into\r\nvarious sorts. The _sahy da secia_ is the size of a hedge-sparrow,\r\nhaving a similar beak; its sides and belly are purple, with the wings\r\nblack above, and the under parts yellow, the tail black, the feet of\r\na rose colour, the head silvery, and the eyes blue. The _sahy bicudo_\r\nis the size of a robin, of a green colour, with the tail and wings\r\nblack, and the bill pointed. The _sahy roxo_ (or purple _sahy_) is the\r\nsize of a sparrow, with the tail and wings black, the head and breast\r\npurple, and the bill short and pointed. The _sahy de colleira_, has the\r\nform and size of a sparrow, with the head purple, the neck rosy, the\r\nbelly green, the sides, wings, and tail, of a greenish hue, and the\r\nbill short. The _sahy-xe_, has the head, wings, and tail of a greenish\r\ncolour, the breast between blue and green, and black near the blade\r\nbone or shoulders and the throat, the hinder part of the back yellow,\r\nand the beak short. The _sahy papagaio_ is the size of a greenfinch,\r\nof a changeable colour, between blue and green, with a black tail and\r\nshort bill, wide at the root and fine at the extremity.\r\n\r\nSANHACO is a sort of greenfinch.\r\n\r\nSERIEMA is a little larger than the turkey-hen; its song is simple and\r\ntender, it goes generally upon the ground, and flies little.\r\n\r\nSERRADOR is a small bird of a blackish colour, with the beak similar\r\nto a sparrow, it only perches upon dry and naked branches, is like the\r\nortolan, and is incessantly rising perpendicularly two or three spans,\r\nalighting upon the same place, and keeping in its movement the time of\r\na _serra_, or saw; it has no song, nor is its plumage beautiful.\r\n\r\nSOFFRER, to which the whites have given the name, pretending that it\r\narticulates the word in its inharmonious song, is little less than the\r\nblackbird, of a gold colour, with the head, throat, tail, and wings,\r\nblack, excepting a white spot in the middle of the wings; the tail is\r\nlong, the bill round, long, and pointed, likewise black, with two white\r\nspots on each side of the lower part; the iris yellow.\r\n\r\nSOCO is a bird comprising various kinds, the white ones are the size of\r\na large capon, without a tail, with the legs a little long, the bill\r\nalso long and blue, the fore part of the head is black, the hinder part\r\nornamented with a long pointed crest, falling back upon the neck, which\r\nis rather long. The ash-coloured ones differ only from the preceding\r\nin colour. There is another larger than the blackbird, being two spans\r\nand a half when the wings are opened, and three from the extremity\r\nof the bill to that of the feet; it is green on the upper part, and\r\nash-coloured below, the bill is long and pointed, the iris yellow, the\r\nneck a span in length, slightly covered with feathers, and spotted on\r\nthe under side; the tail is two inches long, the head is black, with a\r\ncrest.\r\n\r\nTAPERA is a little larger than the blackbird, the whole of the body\r\nwhite, with the head, tail, and wings black, the bill stout and pointed.\r\n\r\nTYHE, or _Tapiranga_, is much larger than the sparrow, the feathers\r\nof the wings large, and those of the tail black, the rest entirely\r\ncrimson; the bill is thick and black, with two white spots upon the\r\nlower part. The _tyhé negro_ (black tyhe) is the same size, with a\r\ngreen spot upon the head.\r\n\r\nTINGARA is the size of a _tentilhao_, or chaffinch, of a sea green\r\ncolour, with the head green, the tail short, and the bill fine, short,\r\nand pointed.\r\n\r\nTUCANO is the size of a pullet, black, with the breast between green\r\nand yellow; the bill, a little curved, is of a thickness and length\r\ndisproportionably large for the body. The _arassary_ is another\r\nspecies of _tucano_, differing in the colour of the feathers; the bill\r\nis a little less and straight, its song is the name by which it is\r\ndesignated. The _tucano_ builds its nest in the cavities of old trunks,\r\nlays only two eggs, and its first plumage is white, it has on each side\r\nof the head a naked portion of a red colour and varnished.\r\n\r\nTUYUYU is much larger than the turkey-cock, white, with the legs black,\r\nis very high, with rather a long neck, the bill pointed, without a\r\ntail, and is the height of a man; it feeds at the margins of lakes, and\r\nits sustenance is fish.\r\n\r\nVIUVA is the size of a sparrow, black, with the head white, and the\r\ntail proportioned. There is another species of _viuva_ the size of a\r\nred robin, also black, with the head white, and the body a little large\r\nfrom the feathers curling very much upon the upper part; the bill is\r\nshort and delicate; it always perches upon dry branches and does not\r\nsing.\r\n\r\nURUBU is a species of vulture, of the size of a turkey-cock, black,\r\nwith the head hairy like it, the bill proportioned and curved at the\r\nupper part. There are two other sorts of the _urubu_, both rare, the\r\none differs only in having a portion green, the other, which is called\r\n_urubu-rey_, is of a whitish ash colour, with the tail and wings black,\r\nthe neck absolutely naked and fleshy, the head imperfectly covered with\r\na soft fur, the crop hairy, the eyelids green, the iris very white,\r\nand the bill black. and has on the upper part of the bill a caruncle,\r\ncomposed of various yellow globules of divers sizes, attached to a\r\ndelicate pedicle.\r\n\r\nIn the interior lakes there is a species of gull, the size of a\r\nswallow, the lower part very white, and the upper of a pearl colour;\r\nthe tail forked, the wings long and narrow, with the three leading\r\nfeathers black, as likewise the fore part of the head; the bill is long\r\nand yellow.\r\n\r\nPATATIVA of an ash colour, is less than a robin, and sings.\r\n\r\nRENDEIRA is the size of a bullfinch and white, with the head, tail, and\r\nwings black, the bill and tail short.\r\n\r\nTICOTICO is of the size of a hedge-sparrow, having its colour almost\r\nupon the sides, with the belly yellow, and a white semicircle above the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nTACOARA is larger than a blackbird, of a greenish colour, with the tail\r\nvery long, the upper part of the head a gold colour, having a large\r\nblack spot round the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PHYTOLOGY.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no country in the world presents such an infinite variety of\r\nvegetation as the Brazil, or so spacious a field for the labours of the\r\nbotanist. It abounds in a diversity of excellent timber, dye-woods, and\r\nmedicinal plants. Nature, here so spontaneous, has not, amongst its\r\ninnumerable indigenous species, any plants and trees of the European\r\nworld. The colonists have naturalized a great number, but they do not\r\nprosper so well as in their native soil. Those of Africa and Asia\r\nsustain no injury when planted in the same latitude. The olive-tree\r\ngrows little, soon droops, and does not fructify in the torrid zone.\r\nThe chestnut-tree is only known in the southern provinces, where\r\npeaches grow in perfection; also the apple, plum, and cherry trees. The\r\npomegranite and quince also prosper in the torrid zone. The vine and\r\nfig grow generally, but more especially out of the tropic. Oranges,\r\nof which there are various kinds, grow universally. Grain does not\r\ngrow in all the provinces, with the exception of rice and Indian corn.\r\nWater-melons are every where excellent; the melon is good only in a few\r\nplaces. The cabbage and lettuce are cultivated, together with other\r\nindigenous hortulans unknown in Europe. The pea, bean, and turnip are\r\nlittle cultivated; with these were also naturalized rosemary, rue,\r\nwormwood, lavender, parsley, coriander, aniseed, mint, the pink, and\r\njasmine. The rose-tree has a great enemy in the ant: its flower is not\r\nhandsome.\r\n\r\nAmongst other trees of excellent wood for building, carpenter and\r\njoiner’s work, are the _ajetahypeta_, _buranhe_, cedar, _conduru_,\r\n_coraçao de negro_, (negro’s heart,) _gonçalo alves_, _jacaranda_,\r\n_jacarandatan_, _jacarando-mulato_, _jequitiba_, _jetahy_, _loiro_,\r\n_massaranduba_, _mocetahyba_, _mocuhyba_, which is high, having a small\r\ntuft, similar to a parasol, and affords a small walnut, somewhat like\r\nan olive, with a thin and smooth rind, inclosing an oval kernel, from\r\nwhich is extracted an oil that is applied to various seus, _brahuna_,\r\nor _maria preto_, _olandim_, _bow wood_, _oil wood_, _violet wood_,\r\n_peguim_, _putumuju_, _oyty_, _oytycica_, _itapicuru_, _sapucaya_,\r\n_sebastiao d’arruda_, male and female, _sucupira_, _sucupirassu_,\r\n_vinhatica_, _sassafras_, and many more.\r\n\r\nALECRIM BRAZILICO (_Brazilian Rosemary_) is a shrub, only similar to\r\nthat of its name in the colour of its flower, bark, and wood; the leaf\r\nresembles that of mint, but is small, with the smell of savory. There\r\nis another sort of rosemary, which differs only from the latter in its\r\nflower, which is white and formed like that of savory. Both grow best\r\nin a dry and sandy soil. ALGODEIRA, or _Cotton-Tree_, is a shrub which\r\nbegins to ramify immediately on appearing, its leaves resembling the\r\nvine leaf. It has five large yellow petals, encircling each other; a\r\ngreat number of capillaments united in one column, in the centre of\r\nwhich a pistil arises to a greater height, of whose germ a capsule is\r\nformed more than two inches in length, triangular, and enclosing in\r\nthree lodgements a great number of seed, resembling that of the pear,\r\ncontiguous and in two orders, and unfolding in a white and long cotton\r\nwool, supplying the most extensive branch of commerce in the Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe AMBUZEIRO, or _Ambuzo Tree_, is of small size, and grows in sterile\r\nlands, not requiring any culture. It begins to have branches on issuing\r\nfrom the ground, and they are exceedingly intertwined with each other;\r\nthe leaves are small, elliptical, and varnished on both sides; the\r\nflower is in small bunches, like the olive-tree; the fruit is similar\r\nin appearance to the sloe, between a green and white colour, having a\r\nthick skin, disagreeable to the taste, with a large round stone, never\r\nseparating from the pulp, which resolves itself into a thick fluid,\r\ngenerally pleasant when ripe. It is much esteemed in the certams,\r\nparticularly by the quadrupeds. The people of the country make of\r\nits fluid and curdled milk, well mixed together, and sweetened with\r\nsugar or honey, a beverage, which they call _ambuzada_, and say that\r\nit might do for a royal repast. This tree produces at the root one\r\nlarge potatoe, and sometimes more, and also small ones of a spongy and\r\ntransparent substance, which turn into cold water on being compressed,\r\nand is a great resource to caravans and travellers passing plains\r\ndevoid of water.\r\n\r\nANDIROBA is a plant, very similar to that of a cucumber, affording a\r\nround fruit, without smell, the size of a large apple, with eleven or\r\ntwelve seeds, round and flat, disposed in three cavities or cells, from\r\nwhich is extracted a clear medicinal oil, being also good for lights.\r\n\r\nANGELIM is a tree of medium height, having many branches, the leaf\r\nsmall, the flower, with five petals in an ear, between a violet and\r\nrose-colour, having a pistil and nine capillaments; the fruit is a\r\ntwo-valved capsule of an ash-colour, affording an oval almond, covered\r\nwith a thick membrane, and which is used in pharmacy.\r\n\r\nARACA MIRIM is a tree of considerable growth, with a small leaf; the\r\nbark is as smooth on the epidermis as the inner side.\r\n\r\nARGUEIRO, or _Argua-Tree_, is the size of the olive-tree, its trunk and\r\nbranches overspread with short prickles; the leaves, which it annually\r\nsheds, are of the shape of a heart; the flowers are in bunches, of one\r\nor two spans in length, at the extremity of the branches, disposed\r\nthree and three; it has five petals of which one only unfolds itself,\r\nthis is of a beautiful rose-colour, with little less than two inches\r\nof length, and more than one in width. Upon the lower part of the\r\npistil, which is amongst ten capillaments, there is a pod, containing\r\nan indeterminate number of _feijoes_, or beans, entirely of a red\r\ncolour, or with black spots; they are very hard, and bracelets are made\r\nof them. It is one of the most beautiful trees in the country when in\r\nflower, in which state it remains for some time.\r\n\r\nThe ARTECUM, or _Araticu_, of which there are various kinds, is similar\r\nto the _ambuzo_ in size, in the entwining of its branches, and in\r\nhaving an ash-coloured rind. The leaves, which it casts off annually,\r\nare almost round, and of a beautiful green, and varnished on both\r\nsides. Its flower is like a fig, of a yellow colour, which opens in\r\nthree equal portions, as if they were parted with a knife, are thick,\r\nof a reddish hue, and in the form of a shell; below each portion there\r\nis a smaller shell, not so thick, and externally white, inclosing a\r\nbutton in the shape of a pine, which becomes a fruit of the size and\r\nform of the largest pear; the pulp is white or yellow, soft and full of\r\npips; few are good, but they are generally eaten.\r\n\r\nThe BARRIGUDA, (_Big-bellied_,) so called in consequence of its\r\ntrunk being thicker at the middle than at the ground, and otherwise\r\ndenominated _Arvore da lan_, (Wool-Tree,) has the rind covered with\r\nround thorns, the leaves are almost elliptical, and from three to four\r\ninches in length. The flower begins with the figure of a little round\r\nfig, smooth, without an eye, having a short and thick pedicle; this fig\r\nhas the length and form of an acorn, being always of a green colour, it\r\nopens at the extremity in three parts, from whence issues a bud similar\r\nto that of cotton, round, and two inches long, which unfolds in five\r\npetals three inches in length. It has five capillaments surrounded\r\nwith a pistil, which is delicate and terminates in a little red ball,\r\nthe whole six attached to a receptacle at the bottom of a cup, where\r\na fruit is formed with some resemblance to a cucumber, which, when it\r\nopens, is full of fine white wool, which the wind blows away if not\r\nimmediately taken; it cannot be spun, but it is used for stuffing beds.\r\n\r\nThere are three sorts of BRAZIL WOOD;--_Brazil Mirim_, which is the\r\nbest; _Brazil Assu_, or _Rozado_, so called from its trunk being\r\nhigher, more upright, of less girth, and the dye which is extracted\r\nfrom it of less consistency and more rosy, hence arises its second\r\nname. The _Brazileto_ differs little from the Assu in size, in the\r\nform of its trunk and tuft, and affords little dye. The Brazil Mirim\r\nhas a larger trunk, the rind greener and finer, the thorns smaller and\r\nthicker, the leaf smaller, and the wood more of a purple hue. The bark\r\nof the whole is smooth and the thorns begin at the shoot and extend\r\nto the point of the branches. The flower of the Mirim is white and\r\nvery small; the wood, immediately on being cut, if put to the tongue,\r\nis sensibly bitter, which, on becoming dry, it loses, turning to an\r\nagreeable sweetness. These trees grow on rocks as well as in plains.\r\nThe wood is heavy and excellent for building; put into water it will\r\nremain sound, it is said, eternally; put into the fire it breaks in\r\npieces, but does not produce any smoke. It is said, that the most\r\nproper periods for cutting this timber for its dye is at the time of\r\nthe new moon in winter, and when in the fourth quarter in summer. A\r\nportion of vitriol and lime, or ashes thrown into the decoction of the\r\nBrazil wood forms a black dye.\r\n\r\nCACAUZEIRA, or _Cocoa-Tree_, which generally does not exceed the\r\nsize of a small tree, almost always has many trunks, and extends its\r\nbranches horizontally and incliningly; the leaves resemble those of\r\nthe largest chestnut; its fruit, which grows only upon the trunks and\r\nthickest branches, is a large oblong capsule, in the shape of a mellon,\r\nwith a very hard rind, which encloses forty to fifty almonds in a\r\nwhite, viscous, and sweet substance. Of these almonds chocolate is made.\r\n\r\nCAFEEIRO, or _Coffee-Tree_, transplanted from Arabia, and prospering\r\nadmirably in the strong and fresh soils of this country, is a branchy\r\nshrub, with the leaves opposite, which are smooth, pointed at both\r\nextremities, and larger than those of the laurel; the flower is white,\r\nentire, and tubulous on the lower part, and cleft into five lancet\r\npoints on the upper, with the same number of capillaments attached to\r\nthe angle of the divisions, and a pistil to the receptacle. The fruit\r\nis a berry, somewhat resembling a cherry, attached to a thick and short\r\npedicle. It is exceedingly fruitful, and grows to the greatest size\r\nwhen planted under the shade of large trees; but the fruit of those\r\ntrees exposed to the sun is of the best quality.\r\n\r\nCAJATY is a shrub with a very thick rind, black, and furrowed with\r\nthe first bark, the leaf differs little from the laurel, and affords\r\na yellow fruit the size of the sloe, having an agreeable taste and\r\nperfume, with seed like the orange, and attached to the extremity of\r\nthe branch by a long and delicate pedicle.\r\n\r\nCAJAZEIRA, or _Cajaza-Tree_, is high, with a round tuft and small leaf,\r\nits fruit is like the acorn, yellow, insipid, and with a large stone.\r\n\r\nThe CAJUEIRA, or _Cajue-nut Tree_, which grows in sandy soils, is a\r\nsmall tree with a crooked trunk, a round tuft, with the branches\r\nraised horizontally and inclined; the first rind affords a sort of\r\nblack dye; the wood a yellow one; the leaves are almost round; the\r\nflower in bunches; its singular fruit is of the size and figure of a\r\nlong round pepper, with a fine smooth skin, tinged with red or yellow,\r\nand sometimes with both, with a white spongy substance, half sweet,\r\nwithout stone or seed; the taste is not agreeable, although many\r\npersons are partial to this fruit; it has at the extremity a nut of an\r\nash-colour, containing a white and oily substance, and not unlike the\r\nchestnut when roasted. Excellent sweetmeats are made of the fruit, and\r\nalso a lemonade and even wine of its juice.\r\n\r\nCALUMBY, or _Calumbo-Tree_, is small, with little tuft, having\r\nexceedingly small leaves, which close when the sun sets and open in the\r\nmorning. There are male and female, both armed with thorns like the\r\nbramble; the male has a very small flower, resembling a paint-brush,\r\nand its wood is green, hard, compact, and very heavy, being only\r\nserviceable for joiners’ work, as scarcely one is found, even amongst\r\nthe most slender, without being hollow. The female has a flower\r\nresembling the chestnut-tree, and its timber, although solid, is not so\r\nheavy, and is waved with green and white. The fruit of both are flat\r\nberries.\r\n\r\nCANDEA (_Lamp_) is a crooked shrub, with a large stock, the leaf is\r\ngenerally white on the under side; the wood, when dried, affords a good\r\nlight without smoke, and saving much oil to the poor of the certams,\r\nwho put a fire-brand of it into the wall, where it lasts for a long\r\ntime, giving a flame like a flambeau; hence comes its denomination.\r\nWhen put into the ground it keeps many years.\r\n\r\nCANELEIRA, _Canela_ or _Cinnamon Tree_, was transplanted from Asia, and\r\nwas cultivated with some care at the commencement of the colonization,\r\nbut was afterwards destroyed, by royal order, that it might not\r\ninterfere with the oriental trade; this error was soon discovered. At\r\npresent the increase of those which spring from roots is preferred;\r\nthe quality of the soil in which it should be planted depends upon the\r\nvegetable. The best Asiatic cinnamon-trees grow in dry soils.\r\n\r\nCOLLA is a tree introduced from Africa, of medium size, with leaves\r\nrather long, pointed, and shining on both sides; the flower is white\r\nand in bunches. It fructifies in a pod.\r\n\r\nCUTEZEIRA, or _Cuteza-Tree_, is small, with horizontal branches, and\r\nthe leaves rather long, smooth, wide, rounded at the point, and pointed\r\nat the base; it affords a large oval fruit with a hard shell, of which,\r\nwhen parted, is made _cuyas_, or cups.\r\n\r\nGAMELLEIRA, or _Gamella-Tree_, is of considerable girth, having a round\r\nand thick leaf; it extends roots from the branches to the ground; its\r\nshade is sought after.\r\n\r\nGEREMMA is a small thorny tree with very small leaves, which daily\r\nclose from the influence of the sun; the flower resembles that of the\r\nchestnut; of its wood charcoal is made for forges.\r\n\r\nGOYABEIRA, or _Goyaba-Tree_, is a shrub with a smooth rind, the leaf\r\nalmost round, the fruit, like a pear, is yellow and odoriferous, the\r\npulp is rubicund, with a great quantity of small and round seed in the\r\ncentre. A preserve much esteemed is made of it.\r\n\r\nGUABIRABEIRA, or _Guabiraba-Tree_, is one of the largest fruit-trees\r\nin the country; its leaf is a little less than that of the peach,\r\nand almost of the same shape; the flower is white; the fruit has the\r\nsize and form of a pear, and is eaten in the same way as _sorvas_ or\r\nservice-berries.\r\n\r\nHERVA DE COBRA (_Serpent-Herb_) is a small plant resembling a little\r\nthe fern in its foliage, the flower is small and yellow, with five\r\npetals, and its fruit is a very little berry. The name arises from its\r\nvirtue in curing the bite of a snake by placing the leaves pounded upon\r\nthe wound and giving the patient the juice to drink.\r\n\r\nThe JABUTICABEIRA, or _Jabuticaba-Tree_, is small and slender, with\r\nsmooth bark; the leaves, which are varnished on both sides, but not of\r\nthe same green, vary in form upon the same branch. It flowers upon the\r\ntrunk only, beginning at the ground, and extending to the branches,\r\nthat are thick; the fruit is generally of the size and colour of a\r\ncherry, and of a good flavour; a strong liquor is distilled from it.\r\n\r\nThe JAMBEIRA, or _Jamba-Tree_, whose size is proportioned to the\r\nquality of the ground upon which it grows, has a pointed leaf, with\r\ndark green on the upper side, and clear green on the under; the flower\r\nhas four small petals in the form of a shell, with numerous long and\r\nupright capillaments, and a pointed pistil still longer; its fruit\r\nresembles an apricot, has a fine flavour, and smells like a rose.\r\n\r\nThe JAQUEIRA, or _Jaca-Tree_, transplanted from Asia, and prospering\r\nonly in the tropics, is a large tree, with a round tuft, a thick\r\ntrunk, large leaves rounded at the extremity and pointed at the base,\r\nvarnished on both sides, the upper one of dark green. Its fruit, which\r\nonly grows upon the trunk and main branches, is very large, (some forty\r\npounds weight,) of an oblong form; the skin is green, rough-grained,\r\nand thick; the white pulp is fibrous, and impregnated with viscous\r\nmilk; but it has another pulp, sown promiscuously with a sort of\r\nalmond, less fibrous, without milk, and sweet, and which is the part\r\neaten.\r\n\r\nJATUBA, which has not this name in all the provinces, fructifies in\r\nhusks like the tamarind-tree.\r\n\r\nJENIPAPEIRO, or _Jenipapo-Tree_, is of good height with the trunk\r\nerect, the tuft round and of medium size; the leaf is similar to that\r\nof the chestnut, very thick, and of a dark green; it is never without\r\nfruit, which is the size of an apple, the skin tenuous, a little harsh,\r\nand of an ash colour, the pulp is white, and the interior full of seed.\r\nThey remain from one year to the next upon the branches, which wholly\r\nshed their foliage, and only change when the tree puts forth its new\r\nleaves, and when already the new fruit, for the following year, is of\r\ngood growth. Its wood is preferred for the shafts of the _sege_, or\r\ncabriolet.\r\n\r\nJIQUITIBA is a tree of considerable girth and affords a nut.\r\n\r\nThe JOAZEIRO, or _Joaza-Tree_, which grows in sandy soils, is of the\r\nsize of a middling olive-tree; its tuft is round and thick; the leaves,\r\nwhich it scarcely sheds, are round and carefully protected; its wood is\r\nwhite, and its ashes are a good substitute for soap. The flower is in\r\nsmall and round bunches; the fruit is of the size of a cherry, oblong,\r\nyellow, disagreeable to the touch, and with a stone (full of smaller\r\nones) which is difficult to divest of the pulp when the fruit is not\r\nhalf dried. It is aliment for some quadrupeds, and for the _jacu_ and\r\nother birds, although few are well flavoured.\r\n\r\nMANGABEIRA, or _Mangaba-Tree_, is of medium size, with small pointed\r\nleaves, and a flower like the _jasmine_; the fruit is round and of\r\nvarious sizes upon the same branch, with a yellow and greenish rind;\r\nthe pulp white, extremely soft, with various seeds covered with down;\r\nthe wood, the leaves, the flowers, and the fruit, when parted, distil a\r\nclammy and white milk.\r\n\r\nThe MANGUE is a small tree, with a smooth rind, thick and varnished\r\nleaves. It prospers only upon the sea-coast or the margins of salt\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nThe MANGUEIRA, or _Mangua-Tree_, transplanted from Asia, and prospering\r\nonly in the torrid zone, is a bulky tree, with a leafy tuft, having\r\na long leaf a little narrow and pointed. The fruit is the size of an\r\napple and a little flat, the skin similar to a greengage, green or\r\nyellow, and tinged sometimes with red; when divested of the skin, which\r\nhas a turpentine taste, the pulp is juicy and delicious, although\r\nunpleasantly full of fibres attached to the stone.\r\n\r\nMOZES is a tree of medium height, slender, with little tuft, remarkable\r\nfor its foliage, which does not differ from the fern; its flower is\r\nwhite, and its ashes are good for the lixivium of soap.\r\n\r\nMUCORY is a large tree of excellent timber; its fruit is of the size of\r\na sloe, yellow, and odoriferous, of very fine flavour, and has a large\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nMURICY is a shrub, with large thick and harsh leaves, rounded at the\r\nend and pointed at the base; the flowers are in bunches, beginning with\r\nyellow and turning to a carnation colour; the fruit is very small, with\r\nlittle flavour. There is another called _muricy-bravo_, (or wild,)\r\ndiffering in the flower, which is white, and in the leaves, which are\r\nmuch less elliptical and varnished on both sides.\r\n\r\nOYTY is a middling tree, of good timber, with fruit well flavoured,\r\nand of the colour and form of a pear, with a large stone, which, when\r\nground or scraped, and used as a beverage or as a clyster, is an\r\nefficacious remedy against diarrhæas.\r\n\r\nThe PALM-TREE OF DATES, which is so abundant in Asia and Africa, are\r\nintroduced only, and very partially, in the province of Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nAmongst the multiplied species of PALM-TREES that denominated _Tucum_\r\nor _Tycum_ is particularly remarkable; its trunk is thorny, slender,\r\nand of proportionable size; its leaves differ a little from the common\r\nresemblance observed amongst all the other palm-trees; from its fibres\r\na flax is made that is a little harsh, but as lustrous as silk, without\r\nany appearance of the coarsest description of flax, and which, from its\r\nstrength, is generally consumed in making fishing-tackle. It is well\r\nadapted for making a certain sort of lace.\r\n\r\nPINDAHIBA is a handsome tree, and of proportionable size according\r\nto the quality of the soil in which it grows; its wood is light; its\r\nleaves are lancet, one inch in width, and from three to four in length;\r\nit fructifies in very small bunches, and its berries are sometimes used\r\nas peppers.\r\n\r\nPIQUIHA, is a medium-sized tree, affording fruit like the quince,\r\nwith a thick and hard rind, and full of a gray liquor, very sweet and\r\ncooling, with some seed like those of an apple.\r\n\r\nPITANGUEIRA, or _Pitanga-Tree_, which reaches the size of a plum-tree\r\nwhen planted in good ground, but generally not exceeding the size of\r\na middling shrub in the woods; its leaf resembles that of the myrtle;\r\nthe flower is white and small, with a great number of capillaments; the\r\nfruit is the size of an unripe cherry, of a scarlet or purple colour,\r\nand rather sour. An agreeable spirit is distilled from it.\r\n\r\nQUINAQUINA, the _Jesuit_ or _Peruvian Bark_, was discovered about three\r\ncenturies ago in Peru, and met with only a few years since near the\r\nheads of the river Cuiaba; it is a high tree, nine inches in diameter;\r\nthe leaves are round at the base and pointed at the end, glossy and of\r\na beautiful green above, and striped with a brilliant dark green in the\r\nhalf near the base. The flowers, which are in bunches at the extremity\r\nof the branches, are shaped like a funnel, with the edge parted into\r\nfive lancet forms, and shorter than the tube, hairy, green in the\r\nmiddle, bounded with white, and fringed at the borders. The pistil is\r\nwhite, and surrounded with five capillaments, within the tube of the\r\nflower. When the flower falls the cup swells at the middle, and takes\r\nthe shape of an olive, changing into a fruit, whose numerous seed,\r\nwhich are long, thick, of a green colour, and flat at the edge, are\r\nenclosed in two lodgements, divided by a double membrane. Thus a tree\r\nso useful to mankind is propagated abundantly.\r\n\r\nAmongst the RESIN-TREES are the _Angico_, which produce the gum-copal;\r\nthose that produce mastick, benzoin, and storax; amongst those that\r\ndistil balsam are the cabureigba, better known by the name of _Balsam\r\nof the Holy Spirit_, the cupahybu, or capivi, and the cumaru.\r\n\r\nAmongst the medicinal plants is noted sarsaparilla, ipecacuhana,\r\njalap, _butua_, purging cassia, quassia, _aristoloquia_, or hart-wort,\r\n_cahinana_, Jesuit’s bark of the country, ginger, _capeba_, commonly\r\ncalled herb of St. Luzia, from its great virtue on application to\r\ndiseases of the eyes. It is said that a surgeon of Rio de Janeiro, in\r\nthe year 1784, by only using the juice of this plant, in the course\r\nof three months, restored the eye of a soldier to its former state,\r\nwhich had been injured by the point of a bayonet. Marvellous cures\r\nare related of this vegetable, which is said to regenerate the sight;\r\nexperiments have been made by perforating the eye of a cock with sharp\r\ninstruments, and on applying the juice or even the milk of this herb\r\nit is asserted that the eye has been cured in a few hours, and the\r\nsight restored. The _curucu_, whose juice, when drunk with water, is\r\nan efficacious stiptic for a bleeding at the mouth. There is also\r\n_betony_, ground-ivy, but very different from that of Europe, with a\r\nleaf resembling the rosemary, and a small white flower in a species\r\nof artichoke; the _herva ferro_ (iron herb); the herbs mercury,\r\n_eurucucu_, and mallows; _orelha d’onça_, (ear of the ounce,) generally\r\ntwo feet in height, the leaf like a heart, flat, and hairy on both\r\nsides, of a pearl colour, and as flexible when dried as when green; the\r\nplant called _hervachumbo_; and many others.\r\n\r\nSAPUCAYA is a high tree of good timber, with a leaf similar to that of\r\nthe peach; the bark, softened, produces a tow for caulking vessels. Its\r\nproduces a very large spherical nut, full of long almonds. For their\r\nextraction nature has formed an orifice at the extremity four inches\r\nin diameter, covered with a lid of the same size, which has over it\r\nan outer rind similar to that of the whole nut, and of which it is\r\nnecessary to strip it in order to find the entrance. The monkeys, by\r\ninstinct, shake off this species of cocoa-nut when ripe, and with a\r\nstone, or hard piece of wood displace the lid and eat the almonds.\r\n\r\nST. CAETANO is a delicate plant, resembling that of a water-melon; its\r\nfruit is a species of small cucumber and thorny; it opens in three\r\nportions when ripe, exhibiting some small seed similar to those of the\r\npomegranite. It is the sustenance of birds, who, carrying its seed,\r\npropagate it in all parts. This plant is applied to various domestic\r\npurposes, and augments the properties of soap in its ordinary use; on\r\nthis account it was transplanted from the coast of Guinea, where it is\r\ncalled _Nheziken_, and being planted near a chapel of St. Caetano, took\r\nthe name of that saint.\r\n\r\nTABABUYA is a tree remarkable for the lightness of its wood, of which\r\nscarcely any thing is made besides corks and floats for fishing-nets;\r\nit resists all instruments except such as are used for cork-cutting.\r\n\r\nTARUMAN is a shrub with lancet leaves of unequal size; the tea of these\r\nleaves have a diluent effect upon stones in the bladder.\r\n\r\nTHEU is a delicate _sipo_ or plant of long and flexible shoots,\r\nscarcely exceeding the thickness of a hen’s quil, but of extraordinary\r\ngrowth, always winding round other larger plants and trees. I have seen\r\nthem so firmly entwined round orange-trees that the prosperity and\r\nfructification of the tree was impeded by them; its leaf is exceedingly\r\nsmall, resembling that of the broom; the root is nearly two yards in\r\nlength, having a strong smell, and operating as an emetic, and is an\r\napproved remedy against the venom of snakes.\r\n\r\nA great diversity of piratical trees or plants are observed in the\r\nBrazil, fixed to the bark or body of others, and nourished alone by\r\ntheir substance. In some parts there are divers species of climbers\r\nwhich rise to the top of the highest trees, sometimes unaccompanied,\r\nat other times twisted spirally with another of the same, or of a\r\ndifferent species. Occasionally these prodigiously long cords have\r\nfour, six, or more legs, or shoots.\r\n\r\nTINGUY is a small tree with the branches and leaves alternate; the\r\nlatter are small and lancet. The bark and leaves well pounded, and put\r\ninto lakes, &c. cause the fish to die, from becoming soon intoxicated\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe URUCU does not in general exceed the size of a large shrub; the\r\nleaves are in the form of a heart, and the flowers in bunches with fine\r\npetals a little purpled, a pistil, and a great number of capillaments;\r\nthe fruit is a capsule, a little flat and pointed, of the size of a\r\nlarge chestnut, and of a green colour, composed of two valves or folds,\r\ncovered with fine soft thorns, and lined with a membrane that encircles\r\na large quantity of small seed, having over them a green substance\r\nwhich, when diluted in water, affords a precious dye. The Indians are\r\nnot ignorant of this, and use it to paint their bodies.\r\n\r\nVINHATICO is a high and straight tree of yellow wood, and fructifies in\r\npods with beans.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of edible roots:--potatoes of various kinds;\r\nmandioca, of which is made the usual bread of the country; its plant,\r\nof which there are various sorts, is a shrub of one or more stems;\r\nthe root, after being scraped and reduced to flour, is pressed until\r\nexhausted of its abundant juice, which is generally poisonous, and is\r\nultimately toasted in a large earthern or copper vessel over a furnace\r\ntill it becomes dry; this vegetable prospers well only in substantial\r\nsoils: it is planted in little mounds of earth, by putting into each\r\nhalf the stock of the plant, which is a span in length. The _aypim_ is\r\na species of mandioca, whose root is boiled or roasted. The _mendubim_\r\nis a plant of little growth, with leaves similar to the French bean,\r\nproducing beans at the root with a gray skin, which encloses from one\r\nto three small seed. The _potatoe do ar_, a creeping plant, without a\r\nflower preceding it, produces a fruit of irregular form, without stone\r\nor seed, is covered with a thin and green skin, and has the taste of\r\nthe potatoe.\r\n\r\nBesides the fruits mentioned there are many others, amongst which are\r\nthe pine, or _atta_, the size of a quince, with a white, soft, and\r\nsavoury pulp; the _conde_, which is of the size of the preceding,\r\nwith the pulp equally soft, but not so white; the _mammao_ is larger,\r\nwith a smooth and yellow skin, and the pulp of the same colour; the\r\n_pitomba_; the _mocuge_; of the _banana_, whose length exceeds many\r\ntimes its diameter, there are three sorts, the whole having a thick\r\nskin, and clustered upon one stalk; the plant which produces them is of\r\nconsiderable growth, without either branches or wood in the trunk; the\r\nleaves are very long, slender, and smooth, with proportionable width,\r\nand the back fibres very thick; the trunk is formed of the leaves\r\nfirmly woven together, being two or three yards in height, round,\r\nerect, and inflexible, the leaves branching out from it at the top. The\r\npine-apple, resembling a pine, with various leaves in the eye, is of\r\ndelicious flavour and aromatic scent; the plant from whose centre it\r\nissues is very similar to the aloe. The _muracuja_ is of the size of an\r\norange, oblong and regular, with a thick and hard skin, green on the\r\noutside and white within; it is full of gross and rather sour liquid,\r\ncontaining seeds similar to those of the melon.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane, mandioca, tobacco, and the matte-plant, are all\r\nindigenous, and now cultivated to a great extent with considerable\r\nadvantage, furnishing many lucrative branches of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe indigo-plant and opuncia are met with almost in all parts; the\r\nfirst, which only prospers in strong soils, is yet cultivated but in\r\nfew provinces. There are a diversity of peppers; that of Malabar, which\r\nonly thrives in substantial and fresh soils, has been cultivated only\r\nwithin a few years.\r\n\r\nThe plant commonly called _malicia de mulker_ (woman’s malice) is a\r\ncreeping and thorny twig, with very small foliage, whose little leaves\r\nobtain their opposite one’s, when they immediately adhere, so that the\r\ntwig is encircled, and remains in this state for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DIRECTIONS FOR THE BINDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1.

We showed them a sheep,\r\nthey took no notice of it. We showed them a fowl; they were afraid of\r\nit, and would not put their hands upon it.”\r\n\r\n[4] “I kiss the hands of your Royal Highness from this secure port of\r\nyour island of Vera Cruz. To-day, Friday, first day of May, 1500. P. V.\r\nde Caminha.”\r\n\r\n[5] “L’altro giorno che fu alli dua di Maggio del derto anno 1500\r\nl’armata fece vela pel camino per andare alla volta del capo di\r\nBuona Speraza. Li quali comincioro no a piangere, et gli huomini\r\ndi quella terra, gli confortavano, et mostravano havere di loro\r\npieta.”--_Ramuzio._\r\n\r\n[6] “We arrived at the Cape of Good Hope at Easter-tide, and there met\r\nwith good weather. We continued the voyage, and arrived at Besengue,\r\nnear Cape Verd, where we met with three caravels, which the King of\r\nPortugal had sent to discover the new land, which we had found in\r\ngoing to Calcutta.”--_From the relation of the voyage of Cabral in\r\nRamuzio._\r\n\r\n[7] “The relations of A. Vespuccius contain the recital of two voyages,\r\nwhich he made upon the same coast (the Brazil), in the name of Emanuel,\r\nKing of Portugal; but the dates are false, and it is in that which\r\nthe imposture consists; for it is proved by all the cotemporary\r\ntestimonies, that at the time which he names he was employed upon other\r\nexpeditions.”--_Hist. Gen. des Voyages_, tom. 14. liv. 6. c. 9.\r\nParis, 1757.\r\n\r\n[8] This is a corroboration of Vincente Yanez Pinson’s voyage, as the\r\ncharacter of the Indians near those two same places where he landed are\r\ndescribed to be similar.\r\n\r\n[9] “The King, Don Manuel, extremely attached to Vespuccius, gave\r\nhim the command of six ships, with which he sailed on the 10th of\r\nMay, 1503, and passed along the coast of Africa and Brazil, with the\r\nintention of discovering a western passage to the Molucca Islands,\r\n(afterwards discovered.) “After entering the Bay of All Saints, he\r\nnavigated as far as the _Abrolhos_ and the river Curababa. As\r\nhe had provisions only for twenty months, he took the resolution\r\nof returning to Portugal, where he arrived on the 18th of June,\r\n1504.”--_Murery Dicc. Grand._ Paris, 1699.\r\n\r\n[10] “Ordered immediately to be prepared another armament of caravels,\r\nwhich he delivered to C. Jacques, a fidalgo of his house, and with\r\nthe title of Captain Mor, ordered him to continue in this undertaking\r\nof discovery. The armament sailed, and pursuing the voyage, arrived\r\nupon the coast, sounding bays and rivers, erecting pillars with the\r\nPortuguese arms upon them. He entered a bay to which he gave the name\r\nof _All Saints_, and after all necessary diligence he returned to\r\nPortugal.”--_Cunha._\r\n\r\n[11] “In the same year, 1503, Gonsallo Coelho was sent to the land of\r\nSt. Cruz, with six ships, with which he left Lisbon on the 10th day\r\nof the month of June. In consequence of not having much knowledge of\r\nthe land, four were lost, and the other two brought to the kingdom\r\nmerchandise of the land, which then were no others than red wood, which\r\nwas called Brazil, and parrots.”--_Goes._\r\n\r\n[12] An overlooker of negroes.\r\n\r\n[13] To kiss his hand.\r\n\r\n[14] No one had suffered the penalty of death for a long period before\r\nJuly 22, 1819, when a wretched criminal was hanged. He had stabbed five\r\nor six men, and it was said his punishment would have been commuted for\r\ntransportation to Africa, had he not imbrued his hands in the blood of\r\na pregnant female, whom he stabbed mortally.\r\n\r\n[15] These parishes in the Brazil are considerable districts of\r\ncountry, and take their names generally from the chief or mother church.\r\n\r\n[16] Mr. Langsdorff has recently (since his return to Europe) presented\r\nto the National Institute of Paris the head of a Botocudo Indian, who\r\nhad been in his service for some years. He sent this Indian to St.\r\nHelena to collect insects, which commission he executed satisfactorily,\r\nand died soon after his return to the Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe Botocudos are really the Aymores of the province of Porto Seguro,\r\nand received their present name from the Portuguese, in consequence of\r\ntheir custom of perforating the ears and lips, and introducing pieces\r\nof wood as ornaments, which they imagine render them more genteel and\r\ncomely.\r\n\r\n[17] This denomination originated in Portugal, where the judge was\r\nprohibited from having any jurisdiction within his native town. Hence\r\nit is applied to judges in the Brazil, universally, without the capital.\r\n\r\n[18] The Torres are two great and contiguous rocks, upon the coast, in\r\n29° 40′ south latitude.\r\n\r\n[19] Sumacas are from ten to nearly two hundred tons burden.\r\n\r\n[20] Bandeira is a name given in the Brazil to an indeterminate number\r\nof persons, who provide themselves with arms, ammunition, and every\r\nthing requisite for their subsistence, with the project of entering\r\nthe territories of the Indians, for the purpose of discovering mines,\r\nexploring the country, or chastising the savages; the individuals who\r\ncompose those companies, call themselves _bandeirantes_, and their\r\nchiefs, _certanistas_.\r\n\r\n[21] Pantanos signifies marshy, and is the name given to the swampy\r\nislands at the mouth of the Tocoary, which are submerged at the floods.\r\n\r\n[22] “By the treaty of limits, liberty was given to these Indians to\r\nremain in the country or to pass to the other side of the Guapore,\r\nwhich latter they did by the persuasions of the Spanish curates. The\r\nmission of St. Roza, which consisted of four hundred Indians, and\r\nremoved in 1754, was near a waterfall, where D. Antonio Rolin ordered a\r\nfort to be constructed. That of St. Miguel, which was in a plain near\r\nthe river, and had six hundred Indians, was removed in 1753; and that\r\nof St. Simao, which comprised more than two thousand inhabitants, and\r\nwas removed in 1752, existed near a river a little below the situation\r\nof the Pedras.” _Extract from the History of the Journeys of the\r\nLieutenant-General of Matto Grosso. M.S._\r\n\r\n[23] Passo is a picture or image representing some of our Saviour’s\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\n[24] The interior districts of provinces are so called.\r\n\r\n[25] A bowl into which diamonds are put when found, from whence they\r\nare taken, weighed, and registered daily.\r\n\r\n[26] He acquired the appellation of Caramuru, which signifies “a man\r\nof fire,” on the occasion of his first discharging a musket in the\r\npresence of the astonished Indians.\r\n\r\n[27] “Where there was a Portuguese, who said he had lived twenty-five\r\nyears amongst the Indians,” proving Correa’s shipwreck to be in 1510.\r\n\r\n[28] The province is designated, as well as the city, by the Portuguese\r\nword for bay, from the great importance justly attached to its fine bay.\r\n\r\n[29] “Sepulchre of Donna Catharine Alvarez, Lady of this Captaincy of\r\nBahia, which she, and her husband, James Alvarez Correa, a native of\r\nVianna, gave to the Kings of Portugal, and erected and gave this chapel\r\nto the patriarch St. Bento. The year 1582.”\r\n\r\n[30]\r\n\r\n    The Don of the land is arrived,\r\n    The one hundred and fifty are ended.\r\n\r\n[31]\r\n\r\n    The Don of the land is on the main,\r\n    The one hundred and fifty remain.\r\n\r\n[32] The precarious nature of the tobacco trade is evidenced by a\r\nshipment made of this article from Bahia to London, where on its\r\narrival it was unsaleable; the agent, therefore, reshipped it for\r\nGibraltar, drawing for the freight and charges he had paid. On its\r\narrival in Gibraltar, it was there equally unsaleable; and, after being\r\ndeposited some time in a warehouse, it was discovered to be rotten,\r\nand condemned by government to be thrown into the sea; after which\r\nthe agent there had to draw also for the freight and charges that he\r\nhad paid, in which was included the expense of throwing the tobacco\r\ninto the sea. The shippers, no doubt, considered the termination of\r\nthis speculation as unpalatable as the element to which it was finally\r\nconsigned.\r\n\r\n[33] One thousand reas, or a milrea, is now worth about five shillings,\r\nand varies according to the exchange.\r\n\r\n[34] “Oh! what a beautiful situation for founding a town.” Hence its\r\nname of Ollinda.\r\n\r\n[35] Some writers have stated that this Duarthe Coelho Pereyra served\r\nas a military man in India; but Duarthe Coelho, of whose military\r\nexploits there Barros and Farria both speak, had not the surname of\r\nPereyra. He died by the hands of the Moors of the island of Sumatra,\r\nafter having suffered shipwreck at the mouth of the river Calapa, in\r\n1527.\r\n\r\n[36] The Dutch armament, commanded by Admiral Hervey Zonk, consisting\r\nof sixty-four vessels, of various sizes, and eight thousand men,\r\nlanded, on the 15th of February, 1630, on the beach of Pau Amarello,\r\nthree leagues north of Ollinda, by the direction of Judea Antonio Dias,\r\nwho had resided many years in the country and acquired a large fortune,\r\nwith which he established himself at Amsterdam. In 1654 the Dutch\r\nevacuated the captaincy.\r\n\r\n[37] A capibara, the animal from which this river takes its name, is\r\nnow in Exeter Change.\r\n\r\n[38] Ollinda, although the head of a comarca, being commonly\r\nconsidered, with Recife, to constitute the city of Pernambuco, they\r\nwill be described together.\r\n\r\n[39] A Brazilian term for the Indian.\r\n\r\n[40]\r\n\r\n                                Erected\r\n                                 under\r\n                      the Illustrious Government\r\n                                of the\r\n                         President and Council\r\n                           in the year 1652.\r\n\r\n[41] Some of these people are also called _certanejos_, inhabitants of\r\nthe certams, or interior.\r\n\r\n[42] I have been informed, since my return to England, that a clergyman\r\nhad arrived at Pernambuco.\r\n\r\n[43] Great River of the North; as there is Rio Grande do Sul, (Great\r\nRiver of the South,) and which must occasion some little confusion,\r\nboth being called Rio Grande: it would be better to designate this St.\r\nRoque, the cape being even a more conspicuous object than the river.\r\n\r\n[44] The Spaniards, from whom the French took this portion of\r\nterritory, always recognized the river Oayapoek and the Vincent Pinson\r\nas the same river; and near its mouth a marble stone was erected, by\r\norder of Charles V. to serve as a limit between his conquests and those\r\nof the Portuguese.\r\n\r\n[45]\r\n\r\n    Conserva o tardo impulso por tal modo,\r\n    Que em poucos passos mette um dia todo.\r\n                             _Cant. vii. p. 57._\r\n\r\n[46] Inhabiting the calingas.\r\n\r\n[47] Inhabiting the campos, or plains.\r\n\r\n[48] Correiçao is a term applied to a judge going out to travel through\r\nthe district of his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n1.
