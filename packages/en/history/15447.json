BEERS\r\n\r\nAuthor of _A Suburban Pastoral_, _The Ways of Vale_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Was unsterblich im Gesang soll leben Muss im Leben untergehen.\"\r\n          --Schiller\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nHistorians of French and German literature are accustomed to set off a\r\nperiod, or a division of their subject, and entitle it \"Romanticism\" or\r\n\"the Romantic School.\"  Writers of English literary history, while\r\nrecognizing the importance of England's share in this great movement in\r\nEuropean letters, have not generally accorded it a place by itself in the\r\narrangement of their subject-matter, but have treated it cursively, as a\r\ntendency present in the work of individual authors; and have maintained a\r\nsimple chronological division of eras into the \"Georgian,\", the\r\n\"Victorian,\" etc.  The reason of this is perhaps to be found in the fact\r\nthat, although Romanticism began earlier in England than on the Continent\r\nand lent quite as much as it borrowed in the international exchange of\r\nliterary commodities, the native movement was more gradual and scattered.\r\nIt never reached so compact a shape, or came so definitely to a head, as\r\nin Germany or France.  There never was precisely a \"romantic school\" or\r\nan all-pervading romantic fashion in England.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, nothing in English corresponding to Heine's\r\nfascinating sketch \"Die Romantische Schule,\" or to Théophile Gautier's\r\nalmost equally fascinating and far more sympathetic \"Histoire du\r\nRomantisme.\"  If we can imagine a composite personality of Byron and De\r\nQuincey, putting on record his half affectionate and half satirical\r\nreminiscences of the contemporary literary movement, we might have\r\nsomething nearly equivalent.  For Byron, like Heine, was a repentant\r\nromanticist, with \"radical notions under his cap,\" and a critical theory\r\nat odds with his practice; while De Quincey was an early disciple of\r\nWordsworth and Coleridge,--as Gautier was of Victor Hugo,--and at the\r\nsame time a clever and slightly mischievous sketcher of personal traits.\r\n\r\nThe present volume consists, in substance, of a series of lectures given\r\nin elective courses in Yale College.  In revising it for publication I\r\nhave striven to rid it of the air of the lecture room, but a few\r\nrepetitions and didacticisms of manner may have inadvertently been left\r\nin.  Some of the methods and results of these studies have already been\r\ngiven to the public in \"The Beginnings of the English Romantic Movement,\"\r\nby my present associate and former scholar, Professor William Lyon\r\nPhelps.  Professor Phelps' little book (originally a doctorate thesis)\r\nfollows, in the main, the selection and arrangement of topics in my\r\nlectures.  _En revanche_ I have had the advantage of availing myself of\r\nhis independent researches on points which I have touched but slightly;\r\nand particularly of his very full treatment of the Spenserian imitations.\r\n\r\nI had at first intended to entitle the book \"Chapters toward a History of\r\nEnglish Romanticism, etc.\"; for, though fairly complete in treatment, it\r\nmakes no claim to being exhaustive.  By no means every eighteenth-century\r\nwriter whose work exhibits romantic motives is here passed in review.\r\nThat very singular genius William Blake, _e.g._, in whom the influence of\r\n\"Ossian,\" among other things, is so strongly apparent, I leave untouched;\r\nbecause his writings--partly by reason of their strange manner of\r\npublication--were without effect upon their generation and do not form a\r\nlink in the chain of literary tendency.\r\n\r\nIf this volume should be favorably received, I hope before very long to\r\npublish a companion study of English romanticism in the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n                                            H.A.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October, 1898._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nChapter\r\n\r\n    I.

To furnish an\r\nanswer to the question--What is, or was, romanticism? or, at least, What\r\nis, or was English romanticism?--is one of my main purposes herein, and\r\nthe reader will be invited to examine a good many literary documents, and\r\nto do a certain amount of thinking, before he can form for himself any\r\nfull and clear notion of the thing.  Even then he will hardly find\r\nhimself prepared to give a dictionary definition or romanticism.  There\r\nare words which connote so much, which take up into themselves so much of\r\nthe history of the human mind, that any compendious explanation of their\r\nmeaning--any definition which is not, at the same time, a rather extended\r\ndescription--must serve little other end than to supply a convenient mark\r\nof identification.  How can we define in a sentence words like\r\nrenaissance, philistine, sentimentalism, transcendental, Bohemia,\r\npre-Raphaelite, impressionist, realistic?  _Definitio est negatio_.  It\r\nmay be possible to hit upon a form of words which will mark romanticism\r\noff from everything else--tell in a clause what it is _not_; but to add a\r\npositive content to the definition--to tell what romanticism _is_, will\r\nrequire a very different and more gradual process.[1]\r\n\r\nNevertheless a rough, working definition may be useful to start with.\r\nRomanticism, then, in the sense in which I shall commonly employ the\r\nword, means the reproduction in modern art or literature of the life and\r\nthought of the Middle Ages.  Some other elements will have to be added to\r\nthis definition, and some modifications of it will suggest themselves\r\nfrom time to time.  It is provisional, tentative, classic, but will serve\r\nour turn till we are ready to substitute a better.  It is the definition\r\nwhich Heine gives in his brilliant little book on the Romantic School in\r\nGermany.[2]  \"All the poetry of the Middle Ages,\" he adds, \"has a certain\r\ndefinite character, through which it differs from the poetry of the\r\nGreeks and Romans.  In reference to this difference, the former is called\r\nRomantic, the latter Classic.  These names, however, are misleading, and\r\nhave hitherto caused the most vexatious confusion.\"[3]\r\n\r\nSome of the sources of this confusion will be considered presently.\r\nMeanwhile the passage recalls the fact that _romantic_, when used as a\r\nterm in literary nomenclature, is not an independent, but a referential\r\nword.  It implies its opposite, the classic; and the ingenuity of critics\r\nhas been taxed to its uttermost to explain and develop the numerous\r\npoints of contrast.  To form a thorough conception of the romantic,\r\ntherefore, we must also form some conception of the classic.  Now there\r\nis an obvious unlikeness between the thought and art of the nations of\r\npagan antiquity and the thought and art of the peoples of Christian,\r\nfeudal Europe.  Everyone will agree to call the Parthenon, the \"Diana\" of\r\nthe Louvre, the \"Oedipus\" of Sophocles, the orations of Demosthenes\r\nclassical; and to call the cathedral of Chartres, the walls of\r\nNuremberg--_die Perle des Mittelalters_--the \"Legenda Aurea\" of Jacobus\r\nde Voragine, the \"Tristan und Isolde\" of Gottfried of Strasburg, and the\r\nilluminations in a Catholic missal of the thirteenth century romantic.\r\n\r\nThe same unlikeness is found between modern works conceived in the\r\nspirit, or executed in direct imitation, of ancient and medieval art\r\nrespectively.  It is easy to decide that Flaxman's outline drawings in\r\nillustration of Homer are classic; that Alfieri's tragedies, Goethe's\r\n\"Iphigenie auf Tauris\" Landor's \"Hellenics,\" Gibson's statues, David's\r\npaintings, and the church of the Madeleine in Paris are classical, at\r\nleast in intentions and in the models which they follow; while Victor\r\nHugo's \"Notre Dame de Paris,\" Scott's \"Ivanhoe,\" Fouqué's \"Der\r\nZauberring,\" and Rossetti's painting, \"The Girlhood of Mary,\" are no less\r\ncertainly romantic in their inspiration.\r\n\r\nBut critics have given a wider extension than this to the terms classic\r\nand romantic.  They have discerned, or imagined, certain qualities,\r\nattitudes of mind, ways of thinking and feeling, traits of style which\r\ndistinguish classic from romantic art; and they have applied the words\r\naccordingly to work which is not necessarily either antique or medieval\r\nin subject.  Thus it is assumed, for example, that the productions of\r\nGreek and Roman genius were characterized by clearness, simplicity,\r\nrestraint, unity of design, subordination of the part to the whole; and\r\ntherefore modern works which make this impression of noble plainness and\r\nseverity, of harmony in construction, economy of means and clear,\r\ndefinite outline, are often spoken of as classical, quite irrespective of\r\nthe historical period which they have to do with.  In this sense, it is\r\nusual to say that Wordsworth's \"Michael\" is classical, or that Goethe's\r\n\"Hermann and Dorothea\" is classical; though Wordsworth may be celebrating\r\nthe virtues of a Westmoreland shepherd, and Goethe telling the story of\r\ntwo rustic lovers on the German border at the time of the Napoleonic wars.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is asserted that the work of mediaeval poets and\r\nartists is marked by an excess of sentiment, by over-lavish decoration, a\r\nstrong sense of color and a feeble sense of form, an attention to detail,\r\nat the cost of the main impression, and a consequent tendency to run into\r\nthe exaggerated, the fantastic, and the grotesque.  It is not uncommon,\r\ntherefore, to find poets like Byron and Shelly classified as\r\nromanticists, by virtue of their possession of these, or similar,\r\ncharacteristics, although no one could be more remote from medieval\r\nhabits of thought than the author of \"Don Juan\" or the author of \"The\r\nRevolt of Islam.\"\r\n\r\nBut the extension of these opposing terms to the work of writers who have\r\nso little in common with either the antique or the medieval as\r\nWordsworth, on the one hand, and Byron, on the other, does not stop here.\r\nIt is one of the embarrassments of the literary historian that nearly\r\nevery word which he uses has two meanings, a critical and a popular\r\nmeaning.  In common speech, classic has come to signify almost anything\r\nthat is good.  If we look in our dictionaries we find it defined somewhat\r\nin this way: \"Conforming to the best authority in literature and art;\r\npure; chaste; refined; originally and chiefly used of the best Greek and\r\nRoman writers, but also applied to the best modern authors, or their\r\nworks.\"  \"Classic, _n._ A work of acknowledged excellence and authority.\"\r\nIn this sense of the word, \"Robinson Crusoe\" is a classic; the \"Pilgrim's\r\nProgress\" is a classic; every piece of literature which is customarily\r\nrecommended as a safe pattern for young writers to form their style upon\r\nis a classic.[4]\r\n\r\nContrariwise the word _romantic_, as popularly employed, expresses a\r\nshade of disapprobation.  The dictionaries make it a synonym for\r\n_sentimental, fanciful_, _wild_, _extravagant_, _chimerical_, all evident\r\nderivatives from their more critical definition, \"pertaining or\r\nappropriate to the style of the Christian and popular literature of the\r\nMiddle Ages, as opposed to the classical antique.\"  The etymology of\r\n_romance_ is familiar.  The various dialects which sprang from the\r\ncorruption of the Latin were called by the common name of _romans_.  The\r\nname was then applied to any piece of literature composed in this\r\nvernacular instead of in the ancient classical Latin.  And as the\r\nfavorite kind of writing in Provençal, Old French, and Spanish was the\r\ntale of chivalrous adventure that was called _par excellence_, _a roman_,\r\n_romans_, or_ romance_.  The adjective _romantic_ is much later,\r\nimplying, as it does, a certain degree of critical attention to the\r\nspecies of fiction which it describes in order to a generalizing of its\r\npeculiarities.  It first came into general use in the latter half of the\r\nseventeenth century and the early years of the eighteenth; and naturally,\r\nwas marked from birth with that shade of disapproval which has been\r\nnoticed in popular usage.\r\n\r\nThe feature that struck the critics most in the romances of the Middle\r\nAges, and in that very different variety of romance which was cultivated\r\nduring the seventeenth century--the prolix, sentimental fictions of La\r\nCalprenède, Scudéri, Gomberville, and D'Urfé--was the fantastic\r\nimprobability of their adventures.  Hence the common acceptation of the\r\nword _romantic_ in such phrases as \"a romantic notion,\" \"a romantic\r\nelopement,\" \"an act of romantic generosity.\"  The application of the\r\nadjective to scenery was somewhat later,[5] and the abstract\r\n_romanticism_ was, of course, very much later; as the literary movement,\r\nor the revolution in taste, which it entitles, was not enough developed\r\nto call for a name until the opening of the nineteenth century.  Indeed,\r\nit was never so compact, conscious, and definite a movement in England as\r\nin Germany and France; and its baptism doubtless came from abroad, from\r\nthe polemical literature which attended the career of the German\r\n_romanticismus _and the French _romantisme_.\r\n\r\nWhile accepting provisionally Heine's definition, it will be useful to\r\nexamine some of the wider meanings that have been attached to the words\r\n_classic_ and _romantic_, and some of the analyses that have been\r\nattempted of the qualities that make one work of art classical and\r\nanother romantic.  Walter Pater took them to indicate opposite tendencies\r\nor elements which are present in varying proportions in all good art.  It\r\nis the essential function of classical art and literature, he thought, to\r\ntake care of the qualities of measure, purity, temperance.  \"What is\r\nclassical comes to us out of the cool and quiet of other times, as a\r\nmeasure of what a long experience has shown us will, at least, never\r\ndisplease us.  And in the classical literature of Greece and Rome, as in\r\nthe classics of the last century, the essentially classical element is\r\nthat quality of order in beauty which they possess, indeed, in a\r\npre-eminent degree.\"[6]  \"The charm, then, of what is classical in art or\r\nliterature is that of the well-known tale, to which we can nevertheless\r\nlisten over and over again, because it is told so well.  To the absolute\r\nbeauty of its form is added the accidental, tranquil charm of\r\nfamiliarity.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he defines the romantic characteristics in art as\r\nconsisting in \"the addition of strangeness to beauty\"--a definition which\r\nrecalls Bacon's saying, \"There is no excellent beauty that hath not some\r\nstrangeness in the proportion.\"  \"The desire of beauty,\" continues Pater,\r\n\"being a fixed element in every artistic organization, it is the addition\r\nof curiosity to this desire of beauty that constitutes the romantic\r\ntemper.\"  This critic, then, would not confine the terms _classic_ and\r\n_classicism_ to the literature of Greece and Rome and to modern works\r\nconceived in the same spirit, although he acknowledges that there are\r\ncertain ages of the world in which the classical tradition predominates,\r\n_i.e._, in which the respect for authority, the love of order and\r\ndecorum, the disposition to follow rules and models, the acceptance of\r\nacademic and conventional standards overbalance the desire for\r\nstrangeness and novelty.  Such epochs are, _e.g._, the Augustan age of\r\nRome, the _Siècle de Louis XIV_, in France, the times of Pope and Johnson\r\nin England--indeed, the whole of the eighteenth century in all parts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nNeither would he limit the word _romantic_ to work conceived in the\r\nspirit of the Middle Ages.  \"The essential elements,\" he says, \"of the\r\nromantic spirit are curiosity and the love of beauty; and it is as the\r\naccidental effect of these qualities only, that it seeks the Middle Ages;\r\nbecause in the overcharged atmosphere of the Middle Age there are\r\nunworked sources of romantic effect, of a strange beauty to be won by\r\nstrong imagination out of things unlikely or remote.\"  \"The sense in\r\nwhich Scott is to be called a romantic writer is chiefly that, in\r\nopposition to the literary tradition of the last century, he loved\r\nstrange adventure and sought it in the Middle Age.\"\r\n\r\nHere again the essayist is careful to explain that there are certain\r\nepochs which are predominately romantic.  \"Outbreaks of this spirit come\r\nnaturally with particular periods: times when . . . men come to art and\r\npoetry with a deep thirst for intellectual excitement, after a long\r\n_ennui_.\"  He instances, as periods naturally romantic, the time of the\r\nearly Provençal troubadour poetry: the years following the Bourbon\r\nRestoration in France (say, 1815-30); and \"the later Middle Age; so that\r\nthe medieval poetry, centering in Dante, is often opposed to Greek or\r\nRoman poetry, as romantic to classical poetry.\"\r\n\r\nIn Pater's use of the terms, then, classic and romantic do not describe\r\nparticular literature, or particular periods in literary history, so much\r\nas certain counterbalancing qualities and tendencies which run through\r\nthe literatures of all times and countries.  There were romantic writings\r\namong the Greeks and Romans; there were classical writings in the Middle\r\nAges; nay, there are classical and romantic traits in the same author.\r\nIf there is any poet who may safely be described as a classic, it is\r\nSophocles; and yet Pater declares that the \"Philoctetes\" of Sophocles, if\r\nissued to-day, would be called romantic. And he points out--what indeed\r\nhas been often pointed out--that the \"Odyssey\"[7] is more romantic than\r\nthe \"Iliad:\" is, in fact, rather a romance than a hero-epic.  The\r\nadventures of the wandering Ulysses, the visit to the land of the\r\nlotus-eaters, the encounter with the Laestrygonians, the experiences in\r\nthe cave of Polyphemus, if allowance be made for the difference in\r\nsentiments and manners, remind the reader constantly of the medieval\r\n_romans d'aventure_.  Pater quotes De Stendhal's saying that all good art\r\nwas romantic in its day.  \"Romanticism,\" says De Stendhal, \"is the art of\r\npresenting to the nations the literary works which, in the actual state\r\nof their habits and beliefs, are capable of giving them the greatest\r\npossible pleasure: classicism, on the contrary, presents them with what\r\ngave the greatest possible pleasure to their great grand-fathers\"--a\r\ndefinition which is epigrammatic, if not convincing.[8]  De Stendhal\r\n(Henri Beyle) was a pioneer and a special pleader in the cause of French\r\nromanticism, and, in his use of the terms, romanticism stands for\r\nprogress, liberty, originality, and the spirit of the future; classicism,\r\nfor conservatism, authority, imitation, the spirit of the past.\r\nAccording to him, every good piece of romantic art is a classic in the\r\nmaking.  Decried by the classicists of to-day, for its failure to observe\r\ntraditions, it will be used by the classicists of the future as a pattern\r\nto which new artists must conform.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to round out the conception of the term by\r\nconsidering a few other definitions of _romantic_ which have been\r\nproposed.  Dr. F. H. Hedge, in an article in the _Atlantic Monthly_[9]\r\nfor March, 1886, inquired, \"What do we mean by romantic?\"  Goethe, he\r\nsays, characterized the difference between classic and romantic \"as\r\nequivalent to [that between] healthy and morbid.  Schiller proposed\r\n'naïve and sentimental.'[10]  The greater part [of the German critics]\r\nregarded it as identical with the difference between ancient and modern,\r\nwhich was partly true, but explained nothing.  None of the definitions\r\ngiven could be accepted as quite satisfactory.\"[11]\r\n\r\nDr. Hedge himself finds the origin of romantic feeling in wonder and the\r\nsense of mystery.  \"The essence of romance,\" he writes, \"is mystery\"; and\r\nhe enforces the point by noting the application of the word to scenery.\r\n\"The woody dell, the leafy glen, the forest path which leads, one knows\r\nnot whither, are romantic: the public highway is not.\"  \"The winding\r\nsecret brook . . . is romantic, as compared with the broad river.\"\r\n\"Moonlight is romantic, as contrasted with daylight.\"  Dr. Hedge\r\nattributes this fondness for the mysterious to \"the influence of the\r\nChristian religion, which deepened immensely the mystery of life,\r\nsuggesting something beyond and behind the world of sense.\"\r\n\r\nThis charm of wonder or mystery is perhaps only another name for that\r\n\"strangeness added to beauty\" which Pater takes to be the distinguishing\r\nfeature of romantic art.  Later in the same article, Dr. Hedge asserts\r\nthat \"the essence of romanticism is aspiration.\"  Much might be said in\r\ndefense of this position.  It has often been pointed out, _e.g._, that a\r\nGothic cathedral expresses aspiration, and a Greek temple satisfied\r\ncompleteness.  Indeed if we agree that, in a general way, the classic is\r\nequivalent to the antique, and the romantic to the medieval, it will be\r\nstrange if we do not discover many differences between the two that can\r\nhardly be covered by any single phrase.  Dr. Hedge himself enumerates\r\nseveral qualities of romantic art which it would be difficult to bring\r\nunder his essential and defining category of wonder or aspiration.  Thus\r\nhe announces that \"the peculiarity of the classic style is reserve,\r\nself-suppression of the writer\"; while \"the romantic is self-reflecting.\"\r\n\"Clear, unimpassioned, impartial presentation of the subject . . . is the\r\nprominent feature of the classic style.  The modern writer gives you not\r\nso much the things themselves as his impression of them.\"  Here then is\r\nthe familiar critical distinction between the objective and subjective\r\nmethods--Schiller's _naiv and sentimentalisch_--applied as a criterion of\r\nclassic and romantic style.  This contrast the essayist develops at some\r\nlength, dwelling upon \"the cold reserve and colorless simplicity of the\r\nclassic style, where the medium is lost in the object\"; and \"on the other\r\nhand, the inwardness, the sentimental intensity, the subjective coloring\r\nof the romantic style.\"\r\n\r\nA further distinguishing mark of the romantic spirit, mentioned by Dr.\r\nHedge in common with many other critics, is the indefiniteness or\r\nincompleteness of its creations.  This is a consequence, of course, of\r\nits sense of mystery and aspiration.  Schopenbauer said that music was\r\nthe characteristic modern art, because of its subjective, indefinite\r\ncharacter.  Pursuing this line of thought, Dr. Hedge affirms that\r\n\"romantic relates to classic somewhat as music relates to plastic\r\nart. . .  It [music] presents no finished ideal, but suggests ideals\r\nbeyond the capacity of canvas or stone.  Plastic art acts on the\r\nintellect, music on the feelings; the one affects us by what it presents,\r\nthe other by what it suggests.  This, it seems to me, is essentially the\r\ndifference between classic and romantic poetry\"; and he names Homer and\r\nMilton as examples of the former, and Scott and Shelley of the latter\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nHere then we have a third criterion proposed for determining the\r\nessential _differentia_ of romantic art.  First it was mystery, then\r\naspiration; now it is the appeal to the emotions by the method of\r\nsuggestion.  And yet there is, perhaps, no inconsistency on the critic's\r\npart in this continual shifting of his ground.  He is apparently\r\npresenting different facets of the same truth; he means one thing by this\r\nmystery, aspiration, indefiniteness, incompleteness, emotion\r\nsuggestiveness: that quality or effect which we all feel to be present in\r\nromantic and absent from classic work, but which we find it hard to\r\ndescribe by any single term.  It is open to any analyst of our critical\r\nvocabulary to draw out the fullest meanings that he can, from such pairs\r\nof related words as classic and romantic, fancy and imagination, wit and\r\nhumor, reason and understanding, passion and sentiment.  Let us, for\r\ninstance, develop briefly this proposition that the ideal of classic art\r\nis completeness[12] and the ideal of romantic art indefiniteness, or\r\nsuggestiveness.\r\n\r\nA.W. Schlegel[13] had already made use of two of the arts of design, to\r\nillustrate the distinction between classic and romantic, just as Dr.\r\nHedge uses plastic art and music.  I refer to Schlegel's famous saying\r\nthat the genius of the antique drama was statuesque, and that of the\r\nromantic drama picturesque.  A Greek temple, statue, or poem has no\r\nimperfection and offers no further promise, indicates nothing beyond what\r\nit expresses.  It fills the sense, it leaves nothing to the imagination.\r\nIt stands correct, symmetric, sharp in outline, in the clear light of\r\nday.  There is nothing more to be done to it; there is no concealment\r\nabout it.  But in romantic art there is seldom this completeness.  The\r\nworkman lingers, he would fain add another touch, his ideal eludes him.\r\nIs a Gothic cathedral ever really finished?  Is \"Faust\" finished?  Is\r\n\"Hamlet\" explained?  The modern spirit is mystical; its architecture,\r\npainting, poetry employ shadow to produce their highest effects: shadow\r\nand color rather than contour.  On the Greek heroic stage there were a\r\nfew figures, two or three at most, grouped like statuary and thrown out\r\nin bold relief at the apex of the scene: in Greek architecture a few\r\nclean, simple lines: in Greek poetry clear conceptions easily expressible\r\nin language and mostly describable in sensuous images.\r\n\r\nThe modern theater is crowded with figures and colors, and the distance\r\nrecedes in the middle of the scene.  This love of perspective is repeated\r\nin cathedral aisles,[14] the love of color in cathedral windows, and\r\nobscurity hovers in the shadows of the vault.  In our poetry, in our\r\nreligion these twilight thoughts prevail.  We seek no completeness here.\r\nWhat is beyond, what is inexpressible attracts us.  Hence the greater\r\nspirituality of romantic literature, its deeper emotion, its more\r\npassionate tenderness.  But hence likewise its sentimentality, its\r\nmelancholy and, in particular, the morbid fascination which the thought\r\nof death has had for the Gothic mind.  The classic nations concentrated\r\ntheir attention on life and light, and spent few thoughts upon darkness\r\nand the tomb.  Death was to them neither sacred nor beautiful.  Their\r\ndecent rites of sepulture or cremation seem designed to hide its\r\ndeformities rather than to prolong its reminders.  The presence of the\r\ncorpse was pollution.  No Greek could have conceived such a book as the\r\n\"Hydriotaphia\" or the \"Anatomy of Melancholy.\"\r\n\r\nIt is observable that Dr. Hedge is at one with Pater, in desiring some\r\nmore philosophical statement of the difference between classic and\r\nromantic than the common one which makes it simply the difference between\r\nthe antique and the medieval.  He says: \"It must not be supposed that\r\nancient and classic, on one side, and modern and romantic, on the other,\r\nare inseparably one; so that nothing approaching to romantic shall be\r\nfound in any Greek or Roman author, nor any classic page in the\r\nliterature of modern Europe. . .  The literary line of demarcation is not\r\nidentical with the chronological one.\"  And just as Pater says that the\r\nOdyssey is more romantic than the Iliad, so Dr. Hedge says that \"the\r\nstory of Cupid and Psyche,[15] in the 'Golden Ass' of Apuleius, is as\r\nmuch a romance as any composition of the seventeenth or eighteenth\r\ncentury.\"  Medievalism he regards as merely an accident of romance:\r\nScott, as most romantic in his themes, but Byron, in his mood.\r\n\r\nSo, too, Mr. Sidney Colvin[16] denies that \"a predilection for classic\r\nsubjects . . . can make a writer that which we understand by the word\r\nclassical as distinguished from that which we understand by the word\r\nromantic.  The distinction lies deeper, and is a distinction much less of\r\nsubject than of treatment. . .  In classical writing every idea is called\r\nup to the mind as nakedly as possible, and at the same time as\r\ndistinctly; it is exhibited in white light, and left to produce its\r\neffect by its own unaided power.[17]  In romantic writing, on the other\r\nhand, all objects are exhibited, as it were, through a colored and\r\niridescent atmosphere.  Round about every central idea the romantic\r\nwriter summons up a cloud of accessory and subordinate ideas for the sake\r\nof enhancing its effect, if at the risk of confusing its outlines.  The\r\ntemper, again, of the romantic writer is one of excitement, while the\r\ntemper of the classical writer is one of self-possession. . .  On the one\r\nhand there is calm, on the other hand enthusiasm.  The virtues of the one\r\nstyle are strength of grasp, with clearness and justice of presentment;\r\nthe virtues of the other style are glow of the spirit, with magic and\r\nrichness of suggestion.\"  Mr. Colvin then goes on to enforce and\r\nillustrate this contrast between the \"accurate and firm definition of\r\nthings\" in classical writers and the \"thrilling vagueness and\r\nuncertainty,\" the tremulous, coruscating, vibrating or colored light--the\r\n\"halo\"--with which the romantic writer invests his theme.  \"The romantic\r\nmanner, . . . with its thrilling uncertainties and its rich suggestions,\r\nmay be more attractive than the classic manner, with its composed and\r\nmeasured preciseness of statement. . .  But on the other hand the\r\nromantic manner lends itself, as the true classical does not, to inferior\r\nwork.  Second-rate conceptions excitedly and approximately put into words\r\nderive from it an illusive attraction which may make them for a time, and\r\nwith all but the coolest judges, pass as first-rate.  Whereas about true\r\nclassical writing there can be no illusion.  It presents to us\r\nconceptions calmly realized in words that exactly define them,\r\nconceptions depending for their attraction, not on their halo, but on\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nAs examples of these contrasting styles, Mr. Colvin puts side by side\r\npassages from \"The Ancient Mariner\" and Keats' \"Ode to a Nightingale,\"\r\nwith passages, treating similar themes, from Landor's \"Gebir\" and\r\n\"Imaginary Conversations.\"  The contrast might be even more clearly\r\nestablished by a study of such a piece as Keats' \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\"\r\nwhere the romantic form is applied to classical content; or by a\r\ncomparison of Tennyson's \"Ulysses\" and \"The Lotus Eaters,\" in which\r\nHomeric subjects are treated respectively in the classic and the romantic\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nAlfred de Musset, himself in early life a prominent figure among the\r\nFrench romanticists, wrote some capital satire upon the baffling and\r\ncontradictory definitions of the word _romantisme_ that were current in\r\nthe third and fourth decades of this century.[18]  Two worthy provincials\r\nwrite from the little town of La Ferté-sous-Jouarre to the editor of the\r\n\"Revue des Deux Mondes,\" appealing to him to tell them what romanticism\r\nmeans.  For two years Dupuis and his friend Cotonet had supposed that the\r\nterm applied only to the theater, and signified the disregard of the\r\nunities.  \"Shakspere, for example makes people travel from Rome to\r\nLondon, and from Athens to Alexandria in a quarter of an hour.  His\r\nheroes live ten or twenty years between two acts.  His heroines, angels\r\nof virtue during a whole scene, have only to pass into the _coulisses_,\r\nto reappear as wives, adulteresses, widows, and grandmothers.  There, we\r\nsaid to ourselves, is the romantic.  Contrariwise, Sophocles makes\r\nOedipus sit on a rock, even at the cost of great personal inconvenience,\r\nfrom the very beginning of his tragedy.  All the characters come there to\r\nfind him, one after the other.  Perhaps he stands up occasionally, though\r\nI doubt it; unless, it may be, out of respect for Theseus, who, during\r\nthe entire play, obligingly walks on the high-way, coming in or going out\r\ncontinually. . .  There, we said to ourselves, is the classic.\"\r\n\r\nBut about 1828, continues the letter, \"we learned that there were\r\nromantic poetry and classical poetry, romantic novels and classical\r\nnovels, romantic odes and classical odes; nay, a single line, my dear\r\nsir, a sole and solitary line of verse might be romantic or classic,\r\naccording as the humor took it.  When we received this intelligence, we\r\ncould not close our eyes all night.  Two years of peaceful conviction had\r\nvanished like a dream.  All our ideas were turned topsy-turvy; for it the\r\nrules of Aristotle were no longer the line of demarcation which separated\r\nthe literary camps, where was one to find himself, and what was he to\r\ndepend upon?  How was one to know, in reading a book, which school it\r\nbelonged to? . . .  Luckily in the same year there appeared a famous\r\npreface, which we devoured straightway[19]. . .  This said very\r\ndistinctly that romanticism was nothing else than the alliance of the\r\nplayful and the serious, of the grotesque and the terrible, of the jocose\r\nand the horrible, or in other words, if you prefer, of comedy and\r\ntragedy.\"\r\n\r\nThis definition the anxious inquirers accepted for the space of a year,\r\nuntil it was borne in upon them that Aristophanes--not to speak of other\r\nancients--had mixed tragedy and comedy in his drama.  Once again the\r\nfriends were plunged in darkness, and their perplexity was deepened when\r\nthey were taking a walk one evening and overheard a remark made by the\r\nniece of the _sous-prefet_.  This young lady had fallen in love with\r\nEnglish ways, as was--somewhat strangely--evidenced by her wearing a\r\ngreen veil, orange-colored gloves, and silver-rimmed spectacles.  As she\r\npassed the promenaders, she turned to look at a water-mill near the ford,\r\nwhere there were bags of grain, geese, and an ox in harness, and she\r\nexclaimed to her governess, \"_Voilà un site romantique_.\"\r\n\r\nThis mysterious sentence roused the flagging curiosity of MM. Dupuis and\r\nContonet, and they renewed their investigations.  A passage in a\r\nnewspaper led them to believe for a time that romanticism was the\r\nimitation of the Germans, with, perhaps, the addition of the English and\r\nSpanish.  Then they were tempted to fancy that it might be merely a\r\nmatter of literary form, possibly this _vers brisé_ (run-over lines,\r\n_enjambement_) that they are making so much noise about.  \"From 1830 to\r\n1831 we were persuaded that romanticism was the historic style (_genre\r\nhistorique_) or, if you please, this mania which has lately seized our\r\nauthors for calling the characters of their novels and melodramas\r\nCharlemagne, Francis I., or Henry IV., instead of Amadis, Oronte, or\r\nsaint-Albin. . .  From 1831 to the year following we thought it was the\r\n_genre intime,_ about which there was much talk.  But with all the pains\r\nthat we took we never could discover what the _genre intime_ was.  The\r\n'intimate' novels are just like the others.  They are in two volume\r\noctavo, with a great deal of margin. . .  They have yellow covers and\r\nthey cost fifteen francs.\"  From 1832 to 1833 they conjectured that\r\nromanticism might be a system of philosophy and political economy.  From\r\n1833 to 1834 they believed that it consisted in not shaving one's self,\r\nand in wearing a waistcoat with wide facings very much starched.\r\n\r\nAt last they bethink themselves of a certain lawyer's clerk, who had\r\nfirst imported these literary disputes into the village, in 1824.  To\r\nhim, they expose their difficulties and ask for an answer to the\r\nquestion, What is romanticism?  After a long conversation, they receive\r\nthis final definition.  \"Romanticism, my dear sir!  No, of a surety, it\r\nis neither the disregard of the unities, nor the alliance of the comic\r\nand tragic, nor anything in the world expressible by words.  In vain you\r\ngrasp the butterfly's wing; the dust which gives it its color is left\r\nupon your fingers.  Romanticism is the star that weeps, it is the wind\r\nthat wails, it is the night that shudders, the bird that flies and the\r\nflower that breathes perfume: it is the sudden gush, the ecstasy grown\r\nfaint, the cistern beneath the palms, rosy hope with her thousand loves,\r\nthe angel and the pearl, the white robe of the willows.  It is the\r\ninfinite and the starry,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThen M. Ducoudray, a magistrate of the department, gives his theory of\r\nromanticism, which he considers to be an effect of the religious and\r\npolitical reaction under the restored Bourbon monarchy of Louis XVIII,\r\nand Charles X.  \"The mania for ballads, arriving from Germany, met the\r\nlegitimist poetry one fine day at Ladvocat's bookshop; and the two of\r\nthem, pickax in hand, went at nightfall to a churchyard, to dig up the\r\nMiddle Ages.\"  The taste for medievalism, M. Ducoudray adds, has survived\r\nthe revolution of 1830, and romanticism has even entered into the service\r\nof liberty and progress, where it is a manifest anachronism, \"employing\r\nthe style of Ronsard to celebrate railroads, and imitating Dante when it\r\nchants the praises of Washington and Lafayette.\"  Dupuis was tempted to\r\nembrace M. Ducoudray's explanation, but Cotonet was not satisfied.  He\r\nshut himself in, for four months, at the end of which he announced his\r\ndiscovery that the true and only difference between the classic and the\r\nromantic is that the latter uses a good many adjectives.  He illustrates\r\nhis principle by giving passages from \"Paul and Virginia\" and the\r\n\"Portuguese Letters,\" written in the romantic style.\r\n\r\nThus Musset pricks a critical bubble with the point of his satire; and\r\nyet the bubble declines to vanish.  There must really be some more\r\nsubstantial difference than this between classic and romantic, for the\r\nterms persist and are found useful.  It may be true that the romantic\r\ntemper, being subjective and excited, tends to an excess in adjectives;\r\nthe adjective being that part of speech which attributes qualities, and\r\nis therefore most freely used by emotional persons.  Still it would be\r\npossible to cut out all the adjectives, not strictly necessary, from one\r\nof Tieck's _Märchen_ without in the slightest degree disturbing its\r\nromantic character.\r\n\r\nIt remains to add that romanticism is a word which faces in two\r\ndirections.  It is now opposed to realism, as it was once opposed to\r\nclassicism.  As, in one way, its freedom and lawlessness, its love of\r\nnovelty, experiment, \"strangeness added to beauty,\" contrast with the\r\nclassical respect for rules, models, formulae, precedents, conventions;\r\nso, in another way, its discontent with things as they are, its idealism,\r\naspiration, mysticism contrast with the realist's conscientious adherence\r\nto fact.  \"Ivanhoe\" is one kind of romance; \"The Marble Faun\" is\r\nanother.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Les définitions ne se posent pas _a priori_, si ce n'est peutêtre en\r\nmathématiques.

H.\r\nBoyesen_, pp. 358 and 356.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe Augustans\r\n\r\nThe Romantic Movement in England was a part of the general European\r\nreaction against the spirit of the eighteenth century.  This began\r\nsomewhat earlier in England than in Germany, and very much earlier than\r\nin France, where literacy conservatism went strangely hand in hand with\r\npolitical radicalism.  In England the reaction was at first gradual,\r\ntimid, and unconscious.  It did not reach importance until the seventh\r\ndecade of the century, and culminated only in the early years of the\r\nnineteenth century.  The medieval revival was only an incident--though a\r\nleading incident--of this movement; but it is the side of it with which\r\nthe present work will mainly deal.  Thus I shall have a great deal to say\r\nabout Scott; very little about Byron, intensely romantic as he was in\r\nmany meanings of the word.  This will not preclude me from glancing\r\noccasionally at other elements besides medievalism which enter into the\r\nconcept of the term \"romantic.\"\r\n\r\nReverting then to our tentative definition--Heine's definition--of\r\nromanticism, as the reproduction in modern art and literature of the life\r\nof the Middle Ages, it should be explained that the expression, \"Middle\r\nAges,\" is to be taken here in a liberal sense.  Contributions to romantic\r\nliterature such as Macpherson's \"Ossian,\" Collins' \"Ode on the\r\nSuperstitions of the Scottish Highlands,\" and Gray's translations form\r\nthe Welsh and the Norse, relate to periods which antedate that era of\r\nChristian chivalry and feudalism, extending roughly from the eleventh\r\ncentury to the fifteenth, to which the term, \"Middle Ages,\" more strictly\r\napplies.  The same thing is true of the ground-work, at least, of ancient\r\nhero-epics like \"Beowulf\" and the \"Nibelungen Lied,\" of the Icelandic\r\n\"Sagas,\" and of similar products of old heathen Europe which have come\r\ndown in the shape of mythologies, popular superstitions, usages, rites,\r\nsongs, and traditions.  These began to fall under the notice of scholars\r\nabout the middle of the last century and made a deep impression upon\r\ncontemporary letters.\r\n\r\nAgain, the influence of the Middle Age proper prolonged itself beyond the\r\nexact close of the medieval period, which it is customary to date from\r\nthe fall of Constantinople in 1453. The great romantic poets of Italy,\r\nBoiardo, Ariosto, Tasso, wrote in the full flush of the pagan revival and\r\nmade free use of the Greek and Roman mythologies and the fables of Homer,\r\nVergil, and Ovid; and yet their work is hardly to be described as\r\nclassical.  Nor is the work of their English disciples, Spenser and\r\nSidney; while the entire Spanish and English drama of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries (down to 1640, and with an occasional exception,\r\nlike Ben Jonson) is romantic.  Calderon is romantic; Shakspere and\r\nFletcher are romantic.  If we agree to regard medieval literature, then,\r\nas comprising all the early literature of Europe which drew its\r\ninspiration from other than Greek-Latin sources, we shall do no great\r\nviolence to the usual critical employment of the word.  I say _early_\r\nliterature, in order to exclude such writings as are wholly modern, like\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe,\" or \"Gulliver's Travels,\" or Fielding's novels, which\r\nare neither classic nor romantic, but are the original creation of our\r\nown time.  With works like these, though they are perhaps the most\r\ncharacteristic output of the eighteenth century, our inquiries are not\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIt hardly needs to be said that the reproduction, or imitation, of\r\nmediaeval life by the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century romanticists,\r\ncontains a large admixture of modern thought and feeling.  The brilliant\r\npictures of feudal society in the romances of Scott and Fouqué give no\r\nfaithful image of that society, even when they are carefully correct in\r\nall ascertainable historical details.[1]  They give rather the impression\r\nleft upon an alien mind by the quaint, picturesque features of a way of\r\nlife which seemed neither quaint nor picturesque to the men who lived it,\r\nbut only to the man who turns to it for relief form the prosaic, or at\r\nleast familiar, conditions of the modern world.  The offspring of the\r\nmodern imagination, acting upon medieval material, may be a perfectly\r\nlegitimate, though not an original, form of art.  It may even have a\r\nnovel charm of its own, unlike either parent, but like Euphorion, child\r\nof Faust by Helen of Troy, a blend of Hellas and the Middle Age.  Scott's\r\nverse tales are better poetry than the English metrical romances of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries.  Tennyson has given a more perfect\r\nshape to the Arthurian legends than Sir Thomas Malory, their compiler, or\r\nWalter Map and Chrestien de Troyes, their possible inventors. But, of\r\ncourse, to study the Middle Ages, as it really was, one must go not to\r\nTennyson and Scott, but to the \"Chanson de Roland,\" and the \"Divine\r\nComedy,\" and the \"Romaunt of the Rose,\"  and the chronicles of\r\nVillehardouin, Joinville, and Froissart.\r\n\r\nAnd the farther such study is carried, the more evident it becomes that\r\n\"mediaeval\" and \"romantic\" are not synonymous.  The Middle Ages was not,\r\nat all points, romantic:  it is the modern romanticist who makes, or\r\nfinds, it so.  He sees its strange, vivid peculiarities under the glamour\r\nof distance.  Chaucer's temper, for instance, was by no means romantic.\r\nThis \"good sense\" which Dryden mentions as his prominent trait; that \"low\r\ntone\" which Lowell praises in him, and which keeps him close to the\r\ncommon ground of experience, pervade his greatest work, the \"Canterbury\r\nTales,\" with an insistent realism.  It is true that Chaucer shared the\r\nbeliefs and influences of his time and was a follower of its literary\r\nfashions.  In his version of the \"Romaunt of the Rose,\" his imitations of\r\nMachault, and his early work in general he used the mediaeval machinery\r\nof allegory and dreams.  In \"Troilus and Cresseide\" and the tale of\r\n\"Palamon and Arcite,\" he carries romantic love and knightly honor to a\r\nhigher pitch than his model, Boccaccio.  But the shrewdly practical\r\nPandarus of the former poem--a character almost wholly of Chaucer's\r\ncreation--is the very embodiment of the anti-romantic attitude, and a\r\nremarkable anticipation of Sancho Panza; while the \"Rime of Sir Thopas\"\r\nis a distinct burlesque of the fantastic chivalry romances.[2]  Chaucer's\r\npages are picturesque with tournament, hunting parties, baronial feasts,\r\nmiracles of saints, feats of magic; but they are solid, as well, with the\r\neveryday life of fourteenth-century England.  They have the _naïveté_ and\r\ngarrulity which are marks of mediaeval work, but not the quaintness and\r\ngrotesquerie which are held to be marks of romantic work.  Not archaic\r\nspeech, but a certain mental twist constitutes quaintness.  Herbert and\r\nFuller are quaint; Blake is grotesque; Donne and Charles Lamb are\r\nwillfully quaint, subtle, and paradoxical.  But Chaucer is always\r\nstraight-grained, broad, and natural.\r\n\r\nEven Dante, the poet of the Catholic Middle Ages; Dante, the mystic, the\r\nidealist, with his intense spirituality and his passion for symbolism,\r\nhas been sometimes called classic, by virtue of the powerful construction\r\nof his great poem, and his scholastic rigidity of method.\r\n\r\nThe relation between modern romanticizing literature and the real\r\nliterature of the Middle Ages, is something like that between the\r\nliterature of the renaissance and the ancient literatures of Greece and\r\nRome.  But there is this difference, that, while the renaissance writers\r\nfell short of their pattern, the modern schools of romance have outgone\r\ntheir masters--not perhaps in the intellectual--but certainly in the\r\nartistic value of their product.  Mediaeval literature, wonderful and\r\nstimulating as a whole and beautiful here and there in details of\r\nexecution, affords few models of technical perfection.  The civilization\r\nwhich it reflected, though higher in its possibilities than the classic\r\ncivilization, had not yet arrived at an equal grade of development, was\r\ninferior in intelligence and the natured results of long culture.  The\r\nepithets of Gothic ignorance, rudeness, and barbarism, which the\r\neighteenth-century critics applied so freely to all the issue of the\r\nso-called dark ages, were not entirely without justification.  Dante is\r\nalmost the only strictly mediaeval poet in whose work the form seems\r\nadequate to the content; for Boccaccio and Petrarca stand already on the\r\nsill of the renaissance.\r\n\r\nIn the arts of design the case was partly reversed.  If the artists of\r\nthe renaissance did not equal the Greeks in sculpture and architecture,\r\nthey probably excelled them in painting.  On the other hand, the\r\nrestorers of Gothic have never quite learned the secret of the mediaeval\r\nbuilders.  However, if the analogy is not pushed too far, the romantic\r\nrevival may be regarded as a faint counterpart, the fragments of a\r\nhalf-forgotten civilization were pieced together; Greek manuscripts\r\nsought out, cleaned, edited, and printed: statues, coins, vases dug up\r\nand ranged in museums: debris cleared away from temples, amphitheaters,\r\nbasilicas; till gradually the complete image of the antique world grew\r\nforth in august beauty, kindling an excitement of mind to which there are\r\nfew parallels in history; so, in the eighteenth century, the despised\r\nages of monkery, feudalism, and superstition began to reassert their\r\nclaims upon the imagination.  Ruined castles and abbeys, coats of mail,\r\nilluminated missals, manuscript romances, black-letter ballads, old\r\ntapestries, and wood carvings acquired a new value.  Antiquaries and\r\nvirtuosos first, and then poets and romancers, reconstructed in turn an\r\nimage of medieval society.\r\n\r\nTrue, the later movement was much the weaker of the two.  No such fissure\r\nyawned between modern times and the Middle Ages as had been opened\r\nbetween the ancient world and the Middle Ages by the ruin of the Roman\r\nstate and by the barbarian migrations.  Nor had ten centuries of rubbish\r\naccumulated over the remains of mediaeval culture.  In 1700 the Middle\r\nAges were not yet so very remote.  The nations and languages of Europe\r\ncontinued in nearly the same limits which had bounded them two centuries\r\nbefore.  The progress in the sciences and mechanic arts, the discovery\r\nand colonizing of America, the invention of printing and gunpowder, and\r\nthe Protestant reformation had indeed drawn deep lines between modern and\r\nmediaeval life.  Christianity, however, formed a connecting link, though,\r\nin Protestant countries, the continuity between the earlier and later\r\nforms of the religion had been interrupted.  One has but to compare the\r\nlist of the pilgrims whom Chaucer met at the Tabard, with the company\r\nthat Captain Sentry or Peregrine Pickle would be likely to encounter at a\r\nsuburban inn, to see how the face of English society had changed between\r\n1400 and 1700.  What has become of the knight, the prioress, the sumner,\r\nthe monk, pardoner, squire, alchemist, friar; and where can they or their\r\nequivalents be found in all England?\r\n\r\nThe limitations of my subject will oblige me to treat the English\r\nromantic movement as a chapter in literary history, even at the risk of\r\nseeming to adopt a narrow method.  Yet it would be unphilosophical to\r\nconsider it as a merely aesthetic affair, and to lose sight altogether of\r\nits deeper springs in the religious and ethical currents of the time.\r\nFor it was, in part, a return of warmth and color into English letters;\r\nand that was only a symptom of the return of warmth and color--that is,\r\nof emotion and imagination--into English life and thought: into the\r\nChurch, into politics, into philosophy.  Romanticism, which sought to\r\nevoke from the past a beauty that it found wanting in the present, was\r\nbut one phase of that revolt against the coldness and spiritual deadness\r\nof the first half of the eighteenth century which had other sides in the\r\nidealism of Berkeley, in the Methodist and Evangelical revival led by\r\nWesley and Whitefield, and in the sentimentalism which manifested itself\r\nin the writings of Richardson and Sterne.  Corresponding to these on the\r\nContinent were German pietism, the transcendental philosophy of Kant and\r\nhis continuators, and the emotional excesses of works like Rousseau's\r\n\"Nouvelle Héloise\" and Goethe's \"Sorrows of Werther.\"\r\n\r\nRomanticism was something more, then, than a new literary mode; a taste\r\ncultivated by dilettante virtuosos, like Horace Walpole, college recluses\r\nlike Gray, and antiquarian scholars like Joseph and Thomas Warton.  It\r\nwas the effort of the poetic imagination to create for itself a richer\r\nenvironment; but it was also, in its deeper significance, a reaching out\r\nof the human spirit after a more ideal type of religion and ethics than\r\nit could find in the official churchmanship and the formal morality of\r\nthe time.  Mr. Leslie Stephen[3] points out the connection between the\r\nthree currents of tendency known as sentimentalism, romanticism, and\r\nnaturalism.  He explains, to be sure, that the first English\r\nsentimentalists, such as Richardson and Sterne, were anything but\r\nromantic.  \"A more modern sentimentalist would probably express his\r\nfeelings[4] by describing some past state of society.  He would paint\r\nsome ideal society in mediaeval times and revive the holy monk and the\r\nhumble nun for our edification.\"  He attributes the subsequent interest\r\nin the Middle Ages to the progress made in historical inquiries during\r\nthe last half of the eighteenth century, and to the consequent growth of\r\nantiquarianism.  \"Men like Malone and Stevens were beginning those\r\npainful researches which have accumulated a whole literature upon the\r\nscanty records of our early dramatists.  Gray, the most learned of poets,\r\nhad vaguely designed a history of English poetry, and the design was\r\nexecuted with great industry by Thomas Warton.  His brother Joseph\r\nventured to uphold the then paradoxical thesis that Spenser was as great\r\na man as Pope.  Everywhere a new interest was awakening in the minuter\r\ndetails of the past.\"  At first, Mr. Stephen says, the result of these\r\ninquiries was \"an unreasonable contempt for the past.  The modern\r\nphilosopher, who could spin all knowledge out of his own brain; the\r\nskeptic, who had exploded the ancient dogma; or the free-thinker of any\r\nshade, who rejoiced in the destruction of ecclesiastical tyranny, gloried\r\nin his conscious superiority to his forefathers.  Whatever was old was\r\nabsurd; and Gothic--an epithet applied to all medieval art, philosophy,\r\nor social order--became a simple term of contempt.\"  But an antiquarian\r\nis naturally a conservative, and men soon began to love the times whose\r\npeculiarities they were so diligently studying.  Men of imaginative minds\r\npromptly made the discovery that a new source of pleasure might be\r\nderived from these dry records. . .  The 'return to nature' expresses a\r\nsentiment which underlies . . . both the sentimental and romantic\r\nmovements. . .  To return to nature is, in one sense, to find a new\r\nexpression for emotions which have been repressed by existing\r\nconventions; or, in another, to return to some simpler social order which\r\nhad not yet suffered from those conventions.  The artificiality\r\nattributed to the eighteenth century seems to mean that men were content\r\nto regulate their thoughts and lives by rules not traceable to first\r\nprinciples, but dependent upon a set of special and exceptional\r\nconditions. . .  To get out of the ruts, or cast off the obsolete\r\nshackles, two methods might be adopted.  The intellectual horizon might\r\nbe widened by including a greater number of ages and countries; or men\r\nmight try to fall back upon the thoughts and emotions common to all\r\nraces, and so cast off the superficial incrustation.  The first method,\r\nthat of the romanticists, aims at increasing our knowledge: the second,\r\nthat of the naturalistic school, at basing our philosophy on deeper\r\nprinciples.[5]\r\n\r\nThe classic, or pseudo-classic, period of English literature lasted from\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth till the end of the eighteenth century.\r\nInasmuch as the romantic revival was a protest against this reigning\r\nmode, it becomes necessary to inquire a little more closely what we mean\r\nwhen we say that the time of Queen Anne and the first two Georges was our\r\nAugustan or classical age.  In what sense was it classical?  And was it\r\nany more classical than the time of Milton, for example, or the time of\r\nLandor?  If the \"Dunciad,\" and the \"Essay on Man,\" are classical, what is\r\nKeats' \"Hyperion\"?  And with what propriety can we bring under a common\r\nrubric things so far asunder as Prior's \"Carmen Seculare\" and Tennyson's\r\n\"Ulysses,\" or as Gay's \"Trivia\" and Swinburne's \"Atalanta in Calydon\"?\r\nEvidently the Queen Anne writers took hold of the antique by a different\r\nside from our nineteenth-century poets.  Their classicism was of a\r\nspecial type.  It was, as has been often pointed out, more Latin than\r\nGreek, and more French than Latin.[6]  It was, as has likewise been said,\r\n\"a classicism in red heels and a periwig.\"  Victor Hugo speaks of \"cette\r\npoésie fardée, mouchetée, poudrée, du dix-huitième siècle, cette\r\nlitèrature à paniers, à pompons et à falbalas.\"[7]  The costumes of\r\nWatteau contrast with the simple folds of Greek drapery very much as the\r\n\"Rape of the Lock,\" contrasts with the Iliad, or one of Pope's pastorals\r\nwith an idyl of Theocritus.  The times were artificial in poetry as in\r\ndress--\r\n\r\n    \"Tea-cup times of hood and hoop,\r\n    And when the patch was worn.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen wore powdered wigs instead of their own hair, and the power and\r\nthe wig both got into their writing.  _Perruque_ was the nickname applied\r\nto the classicists by the French romanticists of Hugo's generation, who\r\nwore their hair long and flowing--_cheveaux mérovigiennes_--and affected\r\nan _outré_ freedom in the cut and color of their clothes.  Similarly the\r\nByronic collar became, all over Europe, the symbol of daring independence\r\nin matters of taste and opinion.  Its careless roll, which left the\r\nthroat exposed, seemed to assist the liberty of nature against cramping\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\nThe leading Queen Anne writers are so well known that a somewhat general\r\ndescription of the literary situation in England at the time of Pope's\r\ndeath (1744) will serve as an answer to the question, how was the\r\neighteenth century classical.  It was remarked by Thomas Warton[8] that,\r\nat the first revival of letters in the sixteenth century, our authors\r\nwere more struck by the marvelous fables and inventions of ancient poets\r\nthan by the justness of their conceptions and the purity of their style.\r\nIn other words, the men of the renaissance apprehended the ancient\r\nliterature as poets: the men of the _Éclaircissement_ apprehended them as\r\ncritics.  In Elizabeth's day the new learning stimulated English genius\r\nto creative activity.  In royal progresses, court masques, Lord Mayors'\r\nshows, and public pageants of all kinds, mythology ran mad.  \"Every\r\nprocession was a pantheon.\"  But the poets were not careful to keep the\r\ntwo worlds of pagan antiquity and mediaeval Christianity distinct.  The\r\nart of the renaissance was the flower of a double root, and the artists\r\nused their complex stuff naïvely.  The \"Faërie Queene\" is the typical\r\nwork of the English renaissance; there hamadryads, satyrs, and river gods\r\nmingle unblushingly with knights, dragons, sorcerers, hermits, and\r\npersonified vices and virtues.  The \"machinery\" of Homer and Vergil--the\r\n\"machinery\" of the \"Seven Champions of Christendom\" and the \"Roman de la\r\nRose\"!  This was not shocking to Spenser's contemporaries, but it seemed\r\nquite shocking to classical critics a century later.  Even Milton, the\r\ngreatest scholar among English poets, but whose imagination was a strong\r\nagent, holding strange elements in solution, incurred their censure for\r\nbringing Saint Peter and the sea-nymphs into dangerous juxtaposition in\r\n\"Lycidas.\"\r\n\r\nBut by the middle of the seventeenth century the renaissance schools of\r\npoetry had become effete in all European countries.  They had run into\r\nextravagances of style, into a vicious manner known in Spain as\r\nGongorism, in Italy as Marinism, and in England best exhibited in the\r\nverse of Donne and Cowley and the rest of the group whom Dr. Johnson\r\ncalled the metaphysical poets, and whose Gothicism of taste Addison\r\nridiculed in his _Spectator_ papers on true and false wit.  It was France\r\nthat led the reform against this fashion.  Malherbe and Boileau insisted\r\nupon the need of discarding tawdry ornaments of style and cultivating\r\nsimplicity, clearness, propriety, decorum, moderation; above all, good\r\nsense.  The new Academy, founded to guard the purity of the French\r\nlanguage, lent its weight to the precepts of the critics, who applied the\r\nrules of Aristotle, as commented by Longinus and Horace, to modern\r\nconditions.  The appearance of a number of admirable writers--Corneille,\r\nMolière, Racine, Bossuet, La Fontaine, La Bruyère--simultaneously with\r\nthis critical movement, gave an authority to the new French literature\r\nwhich enabled it to impose its principles upon England and Germany for\r\nover a century.  For the creative literature of France conformed its\r\npractice, in the main, to the theory of French criticism; though not, in\r\nthe case of Regnier, without open defiance.  This authority was\r\nre-enforced by the political glories and social _éclat_ of the _siècle de\r\nLouis Quatorze_\r\n\r\nIt happened that at this time the Stuart court was in exile, and in the\r\ntrain of Henrietta Maria at Paris, or scattered elsewhere through France,\r\nwere many royalist men of letters, Etherege, Waller, Cowley, and others,\r\nwho brought back with them to England in 1660 an acquaintance with this\r\nnew French literature and a belief in its aesthetic code.  That French\r\ninfluence would have spread into England without the aid of these\r\npolitical accidents is doubtless true, as it is also true that a reform\r\nof English versification and poetic style would have worked itself out\r\nupon native lines independent of foreign example, and even had there been\r\nso such thing as French literature.  Mr. Gosse has pointed out couplets\r\nof Waller, written as early as 1623, which have the formal precision of\r\nPope's; and the famous passage about the Thames in Denham's \"Cooper's\r\nHill\" (1642) anticipates the best performance of Augustan verse:\r\n\r\n    \"O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream\r\n    My great example, as it is my theme!\r\n    Though deep, yet clear, though gentle, yet not dull,\r\n    Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, as to the general fact of the powerful impact of French upon\r\nEnglish literary fashions, in the latter half of the seventeenth century,\r\nthere can be no dispute.[9]\r\n\r\nThis change of style was symptomatic of a corresponding change in the\r\nnational temper.  It was the mission of the eighteenth century to assert\r\nthe universality of law and, at the same time, the sufficiency of the\r\nreason to discover the laws, which govern in every province: a service\r\nwhich we now, perhaps, undervalue in our impatience with the formalism\r\nwhich was its outward sign.  Hence its dislike of irregularity in art and\r\nirrationality in religion.  England, in particular, was tired of\r\nunchartered freedom, of spiritual as well as of literary anarchy.  The\r\nreligious tension of the Commonwealth period had relaxed--men cannot be\r\nalways at the heroic pitch--and theological disputes had issued in\r\nindifference and a skepticism which took the form of deism, or \"natural\r\nreligion.\"  But the deists were felt to be a nuisance.  They were\r\nunsettling opinions and disturbing that decent conformity with generally\r\nreceived beliefs which it is the part of a good citizen to maintain.\r\nAddison instructs his readers that, in the absence of certainty, it is\r\nthe part of a prudent man to choose the safe side and make friends with\r\nGod.  The freethinking Chesterfield[10] tells his son that the profession\r\nof atheism is ill-bred.  De Foe, Swift, Richardson, Fielding, Johnson all\r\nattack infidelity.  \"Conform! Conform!\" said in effect the most\r\nauthoritative writers of the century.  \"Be sensible: go to church: pay\r\nyour rates: don't be a vulgar deist--a fellow like Toland who is poor and\r\nhas no social position.  But, on the other hand, you need not be a\r\nfanatic or superstitious, or an enthusiast.  Above all, _pas de zèle!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Theology,\" says Leslie Stephen, \"was, for the most part, almost as\r\ndeistical as the deists.  A hatred for enthusiasm was as strongly\r\nimpressed upon the whole character of contemporary thought as a hatred of\r\nskepticism. . .  A good common-sense religion should be taken for granted\r\nand no questions asked. . .  With Shakspere, or Sir Thomas Browne, or\r\nJeremy Taylor, or Milton, man is contemplated in his relations to the\r\nuniverse; he is in presence of eternity and infinity; life is a brief\r\ndrama; heaven and hell are behind the veil of phenomena; at every step\r\nour friends vanish into the abyss of ever present mystery.  To all such\r\nthoughts the writers of the eighteenth century seemed to close their eyes\r\nas resolutely as possible. . .  The absence of any deeper speculative\r\nground makes the immediate practical questions of life all the more\r\ninteresting.  We know not what we are, nor whither we are going, nor\r\nwhence we come; but we can, by the help of common sense, discover a\r\nsufficient share of moral maxims for our guidance in life. . .  Knowledge\r\nof human nature, as it actually presented itself in the shifting scene\r\nbefore them, and a vivid appreciation of the importance of the moral law,\r\nare the staple of the best literature of the time.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe God of the deists was, in truth, hardly more impersonal than the\r\nabstraction worshiped by the orthodox--the \"Great Being\" of Addison's\r\nessays, the \"Great First Cause\" of Pope's \"Universal Prayer,\" invoked\r\nindifferently as \"Jehovah, Jove, or Lord.\"  Dryden and Pope were\r\nprofessed Catholics, but there is nothing to distinguish their so-called\r\nsacred poetry from that of their Protestant contemporaries.  Contrast the\r\nmere polemics of \"The Hind and the Panther\" with really Catholic poems\r\nlike Southwell's \"Burning Babe\" and Crashaw's \"Flaming Heart,\" or even\r\nwith Newman's \"Dream of Gerontius.\"  In his \"Essay on Man,\" Pope\r\nversified, without well understanding, the optimistic deism of Leibnitz,\r\nas expounded by Shaftesbury and Bolingbroke.  The Anglican Church itself\r\nwas in a strange condition, when Jonathan Swift, a dean and would-be\r\nbishop, came to its defense with his \"Tale of a Tub\" and his ironical\r\n\"Argument against the Abolition of Christianity.\"  Among the Queen Anne\r\nwits Addison was the man of most genuine religious feeling.  He is always\r\nreverent, and \"the feeling infinite\" stirs faintly in one or two of his\r\nhymns.  But, in general, his religion is of the rationalizing type, a\r\nreligion of common sense, a belief resting upon logical deductions, a\r\nsystem of ethics in which the supernatural is reduced to the lowest\r\nterms, and from which the glooms and fervors of a deep spiritual\r\nexperience are almost entirely absent.  This \"parson in a tie-wig\" is\r\nconstantly preaching against zeal, enthusiasm, superstition, mysticism,\r\nand recommending a moderate, cheerful, and reason religion.[12]  It is\r\ninstructive to contrast his amused contempt for popular beliefs in\r\nghosts, witches, dreams, prognostications, and the like, with the\r\nreawakened interest in folk lore evidenced by such a book as Scott's\r\n\"Demonology and Witchcraft.\"\r\n\r\nQueen Anne literature was classical, then, in its lack of those elements\r\nof mystery and aspiration which we have found described as of the essence\r\nof romanticism.  It was emphatically a literature of this world.  It\r\nignored all vague emotion, the phenomena of subconsciousness, \"the\r\nelectric chain wherewith we are darkly bound,\" the shadow that rounds\r\nman's little life, and fixed its attention only upon what it could\r\nthoroughly comprehend.[13]  Thereby it escaped obscurity.  The writings\r\nof the Augustans in both verse and prose are distinguished by a perfect\r\nclearness, but it is a clearness without subtlety or depth.  They never\r\ntry to express a thought, or to utter a feeling, that is not easily\r\nintelligible.  The mysticism of Wordsworth, the incoherence of Shelley,\r\nthe darkness of Browning--to take only modern instances--proceed,\r\nhowever, not from inferior art, but from the greater difficulty of\r\nfinding expression for a very different order of ideas.\r\n\r\nAgain the literature of the Restoration and Queen Anne periods--which may\r\nbe regarded as one, for present purposes--was classical, or at least\r\nunromantic, in its self-restraint, its objectivity, and its lack of\r\ncuriosity; or, as a hostile criticism would put it, in its coldness of\r\nfeeling, the tameness of its imagination, and its narrow and imperfect\r\nsense of beauty.  It was a literature not simply of this world, but of\r\n_the_ world, of the _beau monde_, high life, fashion, society, the court\r\nand the town, the salons, clubs, coffee-houses, assemblies,\r\nombre-parties.  It was social, urban, gregarious, intensely though not\r\nbroadly human.  It cared little for the country or outward nature, and\r\nnothing for the life of remote times and places.  Its interest was\r\ncentered upon civilization and upon that peculiarly artificial type of\r\ncivilization which it found prevailing.  It was as indifferent to Venice,\r\nSwitzerland, the Alhambra, the Nile, the American forests, and the\r\nislands of the South Sea as it was to the Middle Ages and the manners of\r\nScotch Highlanders.  The sensitiveness to the picturesque, the liking for\r\nlocal color and for whatever is striking, characteristic, and peculiarly\r\nnational in foreign ways is a romantic note.  The eighteenth century\r\ndisliked \"strangeness added to beauty\"; it disapproved of anything\r\noriginal, exotic, tropical, bizarre for the same reason that it\r\ndisapproved of mountains and Gothic architecture.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gates says that the work of English literature during the first\r\nquarter of the present century was \"the rediscovery and vindication of\r\nthe concrete.  The special task of the eighteenth century had been to\r\norder, and to systematize, and to name; its favorite methods had been\r\nanalysis and generalization.  It asked for no new experience. . .  The\r\nabstract, the typical, the general--these were everywhere exalted at the\r\nexpense of the image, the specific experience, the vital fact.\"[14]\r\nClassical tragedy, _e.g._, undertook to present only the universal,\r\nabstract, permanent truths of human character and passion.[15]  The\r\nimpression of the mysterious East upon modern travelers and poets like\r\nByron, Southey, De Quincey, Moore, Hugo,[16] Ruckert, and Gérard de\r\nNerval, has no counterpart in the eighteenth century.  The Oriental\r\nallegory or moral apologue, as practiced by Addison in such papers as\r\n\"The Vision of Mirza,\" and by Johnson in \"Rasselas,\" is rather faintly\r\ncolored and gets what color it has from the Old Testament.  It is\r\nsignificant that the romantic Collins endeavored to give a novel turn to\r\nthe decayed pastoral by writing a number of \"Oriental Eclogues,\" in which\r\ndervishes and camel-drivers took the place of shepherds, but the\r\nexperiment was not a lucky one.  Milton had more of the East in his\r\nimagination than any of his successors.  His \"vulture on Imaus bred,\r\nwhose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds\"; his \"plain of Sericana where\r\nChinese drive their cany wagons light\"; his \"utmost Indian isle\r\nTaprobane,\" are touches of the picturesque which anticipate a more modern\r\nmood than Addison's.\r\n\r\n\"The difference,\" says Matthew Arnold, \"between genuine poetry and the\r\npoetry of Dryden, Pope, and all their school is briefly this: their\r\npoetry is conceived and composed in their wits, genuine poetry is\r\nconceived and composed in the soul.\"  The representative minds of the\r\neighteenth century were such as Voltaire, the master of persiflage,\r\ndestroying superstition with his _souriere hideux_; Gibbon, \"the lord of\r\nirony,\" \"sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer\"; and Hume, with his\r\nthorough-going philosophic skepticism, his dry Toryism, and cool contempt\r\nfor \"zeal\" of any kind.  The characteristic products of the era were\r\nsatire, burlesque, and travesty: \"Hudibras,\" \"Absalom and Achitophel,\"\r\n\"The Way of the World,\" \"Gulliver's Travels\" and \"The Rape of the Lock.\"\r\nThere is a whole literature of mockery: parodies like Prior's \"Ballad on\r\nthe Taking of Namur\" and \"The Country Mouse and the City Mouse\";\r\nBuckingham's \"Rehearsal\" and Swift's \"Meditation on a Broomstick\";\r\nmock-heroics, like the \"Dunciad\" and \"MacFlecknoe\" and Garth's\r\n\"Dispensary,\" and John Phillips' \"Splendid Shilling\" and Addison's\r\n\"Machinae Gesticulantes\"; Prior's \"Alma,\" a burlesque of philosophy;\r\nGay's \"Trivia\" and \"The Shepherd's Week,\" and \"The Beggars' Opera\"-a\r\n\"Newgate pastoral\"; \"Town Eclogues\" by Swift and Lady Montague and\r\nothers.  Literature was a polished mirror in which the gay world saw its\r\nown grinning face.  It threw back a most brilliant picture of the surface\r\nof society, showed manners but not the elementary passions of human\r\nnature.  As a whole, it leaves an impression of hardness, shallowness,\r\nand levity.  The polite cynicism of Congreve, the ferocious cynicism of\r\nSwift, the malice of Pope, the pleasantry of Addison, the early\r\nworldliness of Prior and Gay are seldom relieved by any touch of the\r\nideal.  The prose of the time was excellent, but the poetry was merely\r\nrhymed prose.  The recent Queen Anne revival in architecture, dress, and\r\nbric-a-brac, the recrudescence of society verse in Dobson and others, is\r\nperhaps symptomatic of the fact that the present generation has entered\r\nupon a prosaic reaction against romantic excesses and we are finding our\r\npicturesque in that era of artifice which seemed so picturesque to our\r\nforerunners.  The sedan chair, the blue china, the fan, farthingale, and\r\npowdered head dress have now got the \"rime of age\" and are seen in\r\nfascinating perspective, even as the mailed courser, the buff jerkin, the\r\ncowl, and the cloth-yard shaft were seen by the men of Scott's generation.\r\n\r\nOnce more, the eighteenth century was classical in its respect for\r\nauthority.  It desired to put itself under discipline, to follow the\r\nrules, to discover a formula of correctness in all the arts, to set up a\r\ntribunal of taste and establish canons of composition, to maintain\r\nstandards, copy models and patterns, comply with conventions, and\r\nchastise lawlessness.  In a word, its spirit was academic.  Horace was\r\nits favorite master--not Horace of the Odes, but Horace of the Satires\r\nand Epistles, and especially Horace as interpreted by Boileau.[17]  The\r\n\"Ars Poetica\" had been englished by the Earl of Roscommon, and imitated\r\nby Boileau in his \"L'Art Poetique,\" which became the parent of a numerous\r\nprogeny in England; among others as \"Essay on Satire\" and an \"Essay on\r\nPoetry,\" by the Earl of Mulgrave;[18] an \"Essay on Translated Verse\" by\r\nthe Earl of Roscommon, who, says Addison, \"makes even rules a noble\r\npoetry\";[19] and Pope's well-known \"Essay on Criticism.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of Pope's essay is, in brief, follow Nature, and in order\r\nthat you may follow nature, observe the rules, which are only \"Nature\r\nmethodized,\" and also imitate the ancients.\r\n\r\n    \"Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;\r\n    To copy nature is to copy them.\"\r\n\r\nThus Vergil when he started to compose the Aeneid may have seemed above\r\nthe critic's law, but when he came to study Homer, he found that Nature\r\nand Homer were the same.  Accordingly,\r\n\r\n                \"he checks the bold design,\r\n    And rules as strict his labor'd work confine.\"\r\n\r\nNot to stimulate, but to check, to confine, to regulate, is the unfailing\r\nprecept of this whole critical school.  Literature, in the state in which\r\nthey found it, appeared to them to need the curb more than the spur.\r\n\r\nAddison's scholarship was almost exclusively Latin, though it was\r\nVergilian rather than Horatian.  Macaulay[20] says of Addison's \"Remarks\r\non Italy\"; \"To the best of our remembrance, Addison does not mention\r\nDante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Bolardo, Berni, Lorenzo de' Medici, or\r\nMachiavelli.  He coldly tells us that at Ferrara he saw the tomb of\r\nAriosto, and that at Venice he heard the gondoliers sing verses of Tasso.\r\nBut for Tasso and Ariosto he cared far less than for Valerius Flaccus and\r\nSidonius Apollinaris.  The gentle flow of the Ticino brings a line of\r\nSilius to his mind.  The sulphurous stream of Albula suggests to him\r\nseveral passages of Martial.  But he has not a word to say of the\r\nillustrious dead of Santa Croce; he crosses the wood of Ravenna[21]\r\nwithout recollecting the specter huntsman, and wanders up and down Rimini\r\nwithout one thought of Francesca.  At Paris he had eagerly sought an\r\nintroduction to Boileau; but he seems not to have been at all aware that\r\nat Florence he was in the vicinity of a poet with whom Boileau could not\r\nsustain a comparison: of the greatest lyric poet of modern times [!]\r\nVincenzio Filicaja. . .  The truth is that Addison knew little and cared\r\nless about the literature of modern Italy.  His favorite models were\r\nLatin.  His favorite critics were French.  Half the Tuscan poetry that he\r\nhad read seemed to him monstrous and the other half tawdry.\"[22]\r\n\r\nThere was no academy in England, but there was a critical tradition that\r\nwas almost as influential.  French critical gave the law: Boileau,\r\nDacier, LeBossu, Rapin, Bouhours; English critics promulgated it: Dennis,\r\nLangbaine, Rymer, Gildon, and others now little read.  Three writers of\r\nhigh authority in three successive generations--Dryden, Addison, and\r\nJohnson--consolidated a body of literary opinion which may be described,\r\nin the main, as classical, and as consenting, though with minor\r\nvariations.  Thus it was agreed on all hands that it was a writer's duty\r\nto be \"correct.\"  It was well indeed to be \"bold,\" but bold with\r\ndiscretion.  Dryden thought Shakspere a great poet than Jonson, but an\r\ninferior artist.  He was to be admired, but not approved.  Homer, again,\r\nit was generally conceded, was not so correct as Vergil, though he had\r\nmore \"fire.\"  Chesterfield preferred Vergil to Homer, and both of them to\r\nTasso.  But of all epics the one he read with most pleasure was the\r\n\"Henriade.\"  As for \"Paradise Lost,\" he could not read it through.\r\nWilliam Walsh, \"the muses' judge and friend,\" advised the youthful Pope\r\nthat \"there was one way still left open for him, by which he might excel\r\nany of his predecessors, which was by correctness; that though indeed we\r\nhad several great poets, we as yet could boast of none that were\r\nperfectly correct; and that therefore he advised him to make this quality\r\nhis particular study.\"  \"The best of the moderns in all language,\" he\r\nwrote to Pope, \"are those that have the nearest copied the ancients.\"\r\nPope was thankful for the counsel and mentions its giver in the \"Essay on\r\nCriticism\" as one who had\r\n\r\n                \"taught his muse to sing,\r\n    Prescribed her heights and pruned her tender wing.\"\r\n\r\nBut what was correct?  In the drama, _e.g._, the observance of the\r\nunities was almost universally recommended, but by no means universally\r\npracticed.  Johnson, himself a sturdy disciple of Dryden and Pope,\r\nexposed the fallacy of that stage illusion, on the supposed necessity of\r\nwhich the unities of time and place were defended.  Yet Johnson, in his\r\nown tragedy \"Irene,\" conformed to the rules of Aristotle.  He pronounced\r\n\"Cato\" \"unquestionably the noblest production of Addison's genius,\" but\r\nacknowledge that its success had \"introduced, or confirmed among us, the\r\nuse of dialogue too declamatory, of unaffecting elegance and chill\r\nphilosophy.\"  On the other hand Addison had small regard for poetic\r\njustice, which Johnson thought ought to be observed.  Addison praised old\r\nEnglish ballads, which Johnson thought mean and foolish; and he guardedly\r\ncommends[23] \"the fairy way of writing,\" a romantic foppery that Johnson\r\ndespised.[24]\r\n\r\nCritical opinion was pronounced in favor of separating tragedy and\r\ncomedy, and Addison wrote one sentence which condemns half the plays of\r\nShakspere and Fletcher: \"The tragi-comedy, which is the product of the\r\nEnglish theater, is one the most monstrous inventions that ever entered\r\ninto a poet's thought.\"[25]  Dryden made some experiments in\r\ntragi-comedy, but, in general, classical comedy was pure comedy--the\r\nprose comedy of manners--and classical tragedy admitted no comic\r\nintermixture.  Whether tragedy should be in rhyme, after the French\r\nmanner, or in blank verse, after the precedent of the old English stage,\r\nwas a moot point.  Dryden at first argued for rhyme and used it in his\r\n\"heroic plays\"; and it is significant that he defended its use on the\r\nground that it would act as a check upon the poet's fancy.  But afterward\r\nhe grew \"weary of his much-loved mistress, rhyme,\" and went back to blank\r\nverse in his later plays.\r\n\r\nAs to poetry other than dramatic, the Restoration critics were at one in\r\njudging blank verse too \"low\" for a poem of heroic dimensions; and though\r\nAddison gave it the preference in epic poetry, Johnson was its persistent\r\nfoe, and regarded it as little short of immoral.  But for that matter,\r\nGray could endure no blank verse outside of Milton.  This is curious,\r\nthat rhyme, a mediaeval invention, should have been associated in the\r\nlast century with the classical school of poetry; while blank verse, the\r\nnearest English equivalent of the language of Attic tragedy, was a\r\nshibboleth of romanticizing poets, like Thomson and Akenside.  The reason\r\nwas twofold: rhyme came stamped with the authority of the French tragic\r\nalexandrine; and, secondly, it meant constraint where blank verse meant\r\nfreedom, \"ancient liberty, recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome\r\nand modern bondage of rhyming.\"[26]  Pope, among his many thousand rhymed\r\ncouplets, has left no blank verse except the few lines contributed to\r\nThomson's \"Seasons.\"  Even the heroic couplet as written by earlier poets\r\nwas felt to have been too loose in structure.  \"The excellence and\r\ndignity of it,\" says Dryden, \"were never fully known till Mr. Waller\r\ntaught it; he first made writing easily an art; first showed us how to\r\nconclude the sense most commonly in distichs, which, in the verse of\r\nthose before him, runs on for so many lines together, that the reader is\r\nout of breath to overtake it.\"[27]  All through the classical period the\r\ntradition is constant that Waller was the first modern English poet, the\r\nfirst correct versifier.  Pope is praised by Johnson because he employed\r\nbut sparingly the triplets and alexandrines by which Dryden sought to\r\nvary the monotony of the couplet; and he is censured by Cowper because,\r\nby force of his example, he \"made poetry a mere mechanic art.\"\r\nHenceforth the distich was treated as a unit: the first line was balanced\r\nagainst the second, and frequently the first half of the line against the\r\nsecond half.\r\n\r\n     \"To err is human, to forgive divine.\"\r\n    \"And so obliging, that he ne'er obliged.\"\r\n    \"Charms strike the eye, but merit wins the soul,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThis type of verse, which Pope brought to perfection, and to which he\r\ngave all the energy and variety of which it was capable, so prevailed in\r\nour poetry for a century or more that one almost loses sight of the fact\r\nthat any other form was employed.  The sonnet, for instance, disappeared\r\nentirely, until revived by Gray, Stillingfleet, Edwards, and Thomas\r\nWarton, about the middle of the eighteenth century.[28]  When the poets\r\nwished to be daring and irregular, they were apt to give vent in that\r\nspecies of pseudo-Pindaric ode which Cowley had introduced--a literary\r\ndisease which, Dr. Johnson complained, infected the British muse with the\r\nnotion that \"he who could do nothing else could write like Pindar.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Eastlake in his \"History of the Gothic Revival\" testifies to\r\nthis formal spirit from the point of view of another art than literature.\r\n\"The age in which Batty Langley lived was an age in which it was\r\ncustomary to refer all matters of taste to rule and method.  There was\r\none standard of excellence in poetry--a standard that had its origin in\r\nthe smooth distichs of heroic verse which Pope was the first to perfect,\r\nand which hundreds of later rhymers who lacked his nobler powers soon\r\nlearned to imitate.  In pictorial art, it was the grand school which\r\nexercised despotic sway over the efforts of genius and limited the\r\npainter's inventions to the field of Pagan mythology.  In architecture,\r\nVitruvius was the great authority.  The graceful majesty of the\r\nParthenon--the noble proportions of the temple of Theseus--the chaste\r\nenrichment which adorns the Choragic monument of Lysicrates, were\r\nascribed less to the fertile imagination and refined perceptions of the\r\nancient Greek, than to the dry and formal precepts which were invented\r\ncenturies after their erection.  Little was said of the magnificent\r\nsculpture which filled the metopes of the temple of the Minerva; but the\r\nexact height and breadth of the triglyphs between them were considered of\r\nthe greatest importance.  The exquisite drapery of caryatids and\r\ncanephorae, no English artist, a hundred years ago, thought fit to\r\nimitate; but the cornices which they supposed were measured inch by inch\r\nwith the utmost nicety.  Ingenious devices were invented for enabling the\r\nartificer to reproduce, by a series of complicated curves, the profile of\r\na Doric capital, which probably owed its form to the steady hand and\r\nuncontrolled taste of the designer.  To put faith in many of the theories\r\npropounded by architectural authorities in the last century, would be to\r\nbelieve that some of the grandest monuments which the world has ever seen\r\nraised, owe their chief beauty to an accurate knowledge of arithmetic.\r\nThe diameter of the column was divided into modules: the modules were\r\ndivided into minutes; the minutes into fractions of themselves.  A\r\ncertain height was allotted to the shaft, another to the entablature. . .\r\nSometimes the learned discussed how far apart the columns of a portico\r\nmight be.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThis kind of mensuration reminds one of the disputes between French\r\ncritics as to whether the unity of time meant thirty hours, or\r\ntwenty-four, or twelve, or the actual time that it took to act the play;\r\nor of the geometric method of the \"Saturday papers\" in the _Spectator_.\r\nAddison tries \"Paradise Lost\" by Aristotle's rules for the composition of\r\nan epic.  Is it the narrative of a single great action?  Does it begin\r\n_in medias res_, as is proper, or _ab ovo Ledae_, as Horace has said that\r\nan epic ought not?  Does it bring in the introductory matter by way of\r\nepisode, after the approved recipe of Homer and Vergil?  Has it\r\nallegorical characters, contrary to the practice of the ancients?  Does\r\nthe poet intrude personally into his poem, thus mixing the lyric and epic\r\nstyles? etc.  Not a word as to Milton's puritanism, or his\r\n_Weltanschauung_, or the relation of his work to its environment.\r\nNothing of that historical and sympathetic method--that endeavor to put\r\nthe reader at the poet's point of view--by which modern critics, from\r\nLessing to Sainte-Beuve, have revolutionized their art.  Addison looks at\r\n\"Paradise Lost\" as something quite distinct from Milton: as a\r\nmanufactured article to be tested by comparing it with standard fabrics\r\nby recognized makers, like the authors of the Iliad and Aeneid.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen Anne poetry took a serious turn, the generalizing spirit\r\nof the age led it almost always into the paths of ethical and didactic\r\nverse.  \"It stooped to truth and moralized its song,\" finding its\r\nfavorite occupation in the sententious expression of platitudes--the\r\nepigram in satire, the maxim in serious work.  It became a poetry of\r\naphorisms, instruction us with Pope that\r\n\r\n    \"Virtue alone is happiness below;\"\r\n\r\nor, with Young, that\r\n\r\n    \"Procrastination is the thief of time;\"\r\n\r\nor, with Johnson, that\r\n\r\n    \"Slow rises worth by poverty depressed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it attempted to deal concretely with the passions, it found itself\r\nimpotent.  Pope's \"Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard\" rings hollow: it is\r\nrhetoric, not poetry.  The closing lines of \"The Dunciad\"--so strangely\r\noverpraised by Thackeray--with their metallic clank and grandiose\r\nverbiage, are not truly imaginative.  The poet is simply working himself\r\nup to a climax of the false sublime, as an orator deliberately attaches a\r\nsounding peroration to his speech.  Pope is always \"heard,\" never\r\n\"overheard.\"\r\n\r\nThe poverty of the classical period in lyrical verse is particularly\r\nsignificant, because the song is the most primitive and spontaneous kind\r\nof poetry, and the most direct utterance of personal feeling.  Whatever\r\nelse the poets of Pope's time could do, they could not sing.  They are\r\nthe despair of the anthologists.[30]  Here and there among the brilliant\r\nreasoners, _raconteurs_, and satirists in verse, occurs a clever\r\nepigrammatist like Prior, or a ballad writer like Henry Carey, whose\r\n\"Sally in Our Alley\" shows the singing, and not talking, voice, but\r\nhardly the lyric cry.  Gay's \"Blackeyed Susan\" has genuine quality,\r\nthough its _rococo_ graces are more than half artificial.  Sweet William\r\nis very much such an opera sailor-man as Bumkinet or Grubbinol is a\r\nshepherd, and his wooing is beribboned with conceits like these:\r\n\r\n    \"If to fair India's coast we sail,\r\n      Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright,\r\n    Thy breath is Afric's spicy gale,\r\n      Thy skin is ivory so white.\r\n    Thus every beauteous prospect that I view,\r\n    Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the same with the poetry of outward nature as with the poetry of\r\nhuman passion.[31]  In Addison's \"Letter from Italy,\" in Pope's\r\n\"Pastorals,\" and \"Windsor Forest,\" the imagery, when not actually false,\r\nis vague and conventional, and the language abounds in classical\r\ninsipidities, epithets that describe nothing, and generalities at second\r\nhand from older poets, who may once, perhaps, have written with their\r\n\"eyes upon the object.\"  Blushing Flora paints the enameled ground;\r\ncheerful murmurs fluctuate on the gale; Eridanus through flowery meadows\r\nstrays; gay gilded[32] scenes and shining prospects rise; while\r\neverywhere are balmy zephyrs, sylvan shades, winding vales, vocal shores,\r\nsilver floods, crystal springs, feathered quires, and Phoebus and\r\nPhilomel and Ceres' gifts assist the purple year.  It was after this\r\nfashion that Pope rendered the famous moonlight passage in his\r\ntranslation of the Iliad:\r\n\r\n    \"Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,\r\n    A flood of glory bursts from all the skies,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\"Strange to think of an enthusiast,\" says Wordsworth, \"reciting these\r\nverses under the cope of a moonlight sky, without having his raptures in\r\nthe least disturbed by a suspicion of their absurdity.\"  The poetic\r\ndiction against which Wordsworth protested was an outward sign of the\r\nclassical preference for the general over the concrete.  The vocabulary\r\nwas Latinized because, in English, the _mot propre_ is commonly a Saxon\r\nword, while its Latin synonym has a convenient indefiniteness that keeps\r\nthe subject at arm's length.  Of a similar tendency was the favorite\r\nrhetorical figure of personification, which gave a false air of life to\r\nabstractions by the easy process of spelling them with a capital letter.\r\nThus:\r\n\r\n    \"From bard to bard the frigid caution crept,\r\n    Till Declamation roared whilst Passion slept;\r\n    Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread,\r\n    Philosophy remained though Nature fled,. . .\r\n    Exulting Folly hailed the joyful day,\r\n    And Pantomime and Song confirmed her sway.\"[33]\r\n\r\nEverything was personified; Britannia, Justice, Liberty, Science,\r\nMelancholy, Night.  Even vaccination for the smallpox was invoked as a\r\ngoddess,\r\n\r\n    \"Inoculation, heavenly maid, descend!\"[34]\r\n\r\nBut circumstances or periphrasis was the capital means by which the\r\nAugustan poet avoided precision and attained nobility of style.  It\r\nenabled him to speak of a woman as a \"nymph,\" or a \"fair\"; of sheep as\r\n\"the fleecy care\"; of fishes as \"the scaly tribe\"; and of a picket fence\r\nas a \"spiculated paling.\"  Lowell says of Pope's followers: \"As the\r\nmaster had made it an axiom to avoid what was mean or low, so the\r\ndisciples endeavored to escape from what was common.  This they contrived\r\nby the ready expedient of the periphrasis.  They called everything\r\nsomething else.  A boot with them was\r\n\r\n    \"'The shining leather that encased the limb.'\r\n\r\n\"Coffee became\r\n\r\n    \"'The fragrant juice of Mocha's berry brown.'\"[35]\r\n\r\n\"For the direct appeal to Nature, and the naming of specific objects,\"\r\nsays Mr. Gosse,[36] \"they substituted generalities and second-hand\r\nallusions.  They no longer mentioned the gillyflower and the daffodil,\r\nbut permitted themselves a general reference to Flora's vernal wreath.\r\nIt was vulgar to say that the moon was rising; the gentlemanly expression\r\nwas, 'Cynthia is lifting her silver horn!'  Women became nymphs in this\r\nnew phraseology, fruits became 'the treasures of Pomona,' a horse became\r\n'the impatient courser.'  The result of coining these conventional\r\ncounters for groups of ideas was that the personal, the exact, was lost\r\nin literature.  Apples were the treasures of Pomona, but so were\r\ncherries, too, and if one wished to allude to peaches, they also were the\r\ntreasures of Pomona.  This decline from particular to general language\r\nwas regarded as a great gain in elegance.  It was supposed that to use\r\none of these genteel counters, which passed for coin of poetic language,\r\nbrought the speaker closer to the grace of Latinity.  It was thought that\r\nthe old direct manner of speaking was crude and futile; that a romantic\r\npoet who wished to allude to caterpillars could do so without any\r\nexercise of his ingenuity by simply introducing the word 'caterpillars,'\r\nwhereas the classical poet had to prove that he was a scholar and a\r\ngentleman by inventing some circumlocution, such as 'the crawling scourge\r\nthat smites the leafy plain.'. . .  In the generation that succeeded Pope\r\nreally clever writers spoke of a 'gelid cistern,' when they meant a cold\r\nbath, and 'the loud hunter-crew' when they meant a pack of foxhounds.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that the men of Pope's generation,\r\nincluding Pope himself, were altogether wanting in romantic feeling.\r\nThere is a marked romantic accent in the Countess of Winchelsea's ode \"To\r\nthe Nightingale\"; in her \"Nocturnal Reverie\"; in Parnell's \"Night Piece\r\non Death,\" and in the work of several Scotch poets, like Allan Ramsay and\r\nHamilton of Bangour, whose ballad, \"The Braces of Yarrow,\" is certainly a\r\nstrange poem to come out of the heart of the eighteenth century.  But\r\nthese are eddies and back currents in the stream of literary tendency.\r\nWe are always in danger of forgetting that the literature of an age does\r\nnot express its entire, but only its prevailing, spirit.  There is\r\ncommonly a latent, silent body of thought and feeling underneath which\r\nremains inarticulate, or nearly so.  It is this prevailing spirit and\r\nfashion which I have endeavored to describe in the present chapter.  If\r\nthe picture seems to lack relief, or to be in any way exaggerated, the\r\nreader should consult the chapters on \"Classicism\" and \"The\r\nPseudo-Classicists\" in M. Pellisier's \"Literary Movement in France,\"\r\nalready several times referred to.  They describe a literary situation\r\nwhich had a very exact counterpart in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] As another notable weakness of the age is its habit of looking, to the\r\npast ages--not understanding them all the while . . . so Scott gives up\r\nnearly the half of his intellectual power to a fond yet purposeless\r\ndreaming over the past; and spends half his literary labors in endeavors\r\nto revive it, not in reality, but on the stage of fiction: endeavors\r\nwhich were the best of the kind that modernism made, but still successful\r\nonly so far as Scott put under the old armor the everlasting human nature\r\nwhich he knew; and totally unsuccessful so far as concerned the painting\r\nof the armor itself, which he knew _not_. . .  His romance and\r\nantiquarianism, his knighthood and monkery, are all false, and he knows\r\nthem to be false.--_Ruskin, \"Modern Painters,\"_ Vol. III. p. 279 (First\r\nAmerican Edition, 1860).\r\n\r\n[2] See also the sly hit at popular fiction in the _Nonnë Prestës Tale_:\r\n\r\n    \"This story is also trewe, I undertake,\r\n    As is the book of Launcelot de Lake,\r\n    That women hold in ful gret reverence.\"\r\n\r\n[3] \"History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century,\" Vol. II. chap\r\nxii, section vii.\r\n\r\n[4] Sentimentalism approaches its subject through the feelings;\r\nromanticism through the imagination.\r\n\r\n[5] Ruskin, too indicates the common element in romanticism and\r\nnaturalism--a desire to escape from the Augustan formalism.  I condense\r\nthe passage slightly: \"To powder the hair, to patch the cheek, to hoop\r\nthe body, to buckle the foot, were all part and parcel of the same system\r\nwhich reduced streets to brick walls and pictures to brown stains.\r\nReaction from this state was inevitable, and accordingly men steal out to\r\nthe fields and mountains; and, finding among these color and liberty and\r\nvariety and power, rejoice in all the wildest shattering of the mountain\r\nside, as an opposition to Gower Street.  It is not, however, only to\r\nexisting inanimate nature that our want of beauty in person and dress has\r\ndriven us.  The imagination of it, as it was seen in our ancestors,\r\nhaunts us continually.  We look fondly back to the manners of the age\r\nsought in the centuries which we profess to have surpassed in\r\neverything. . .  This romantic love of beauty, forced to seek in history\r\nand in external nature the satisfaction it cannot find in ordinary\r\nlife.\"--_Modern Painters_, Vol. III. p. 260.\r\n\r\n[6] Although devout in their admiration for antiquity, the writers of the\r\nseventeenth century have by no means always clearly grasped the object of\r\ntheir cult.  Though they may understand Latin tradition, they have\r\ncertainly never entered into the freer, more original spirit of Greek\r\nart.  They have but an incomplete, superficial conception of\r\nHellenism. . .  Boileau celebrates but does not understand Pindar. . .\r\nThe seventeenth century comprehended Homer no better than Pindar.  What\r\nwe miss in them is exactly what we like best in his epopee--the vast\r\nliving picture of semi-barbarous civilization. . .  No society could be\r\nless fitted than that of the seventeenth century to feel and understand\r\nthe spirit of primitive antiquity.  In order to appreciate Homer, it was\r\nthought necessary to civilize the barbarian, make him a scrupulous\r\nwriter, and convince him that the word \"ass\" is a \"very noble\" expression\r\nin Greek--_Pellisier: \"The Literary Movement in France\" (Brinton's\r\ntranslation, _1897), pp. 8-10.  So Addison apologizes for Homer's failure\r\nto observe those qualities of nicety, correctness, and what the French\r\ncall _bienséance_ (decorum,) the necessity of which had only been found\r\nout in later times.

But, as original creative genius is not\r\nalways forthcoming, a literary revolution commonly begins with imitation.\r\nIt seeks inspiration in the past, and substitutes a new set of models as\r\ndifferent as possible from those which it finds currently followed.  In\r\nevery country of Europe the classical tradition had hidden whatever was\r\nmost national, most individual, in its earlier culture, under a smooth,\r\nuniform veneer.  To break away from modern convention, England and\r\nGermany, and afterward France, went back to ancient springs of national\r\nlife; not always, at first, wisely, but in obedience to a true instinct.\r\n\r\nHow far did any knowledge or love of the old romantic literature of\r\nEngland survive among the contemporaries of Dryden and Pope?  It is not\r\nhard to furnish an answer to this question.  The prefaces of Dryden, the\r\ncritical treatises of Dennis, Winstanley, Oldmixon, Rymer, Langbaine,\r\nGildon, Shaftesbury, and many others, together with hundreds of passages\r\nin prologues and epilogues to plays; in periodical essays like the\r\n_Tatler_ and _Spectator_; in verse essays like Roscommon's, Mulgrave's\r\nand Pope's; in prefaces to various editions of Shakspere and Spenser; in\r\nletters, memoirs, etc., supply a mass of testimony to the fact that\r\nneglect and contempt had, with a few exceptions, overtaken all English\r\nwriters who wrote before the middle of the seventeenth century.  The\r\nexceptions, of course, were those supreme masters whose genius prevailed\r\nagainst every change of taste: Shakspere and Milton, and, in a less\r\ndegree, Chaucer and Spenser.  Of authors strictly mediaeval, Chaucer\r\nstill had readers, and there were reprints of his works in 1687, 1721,\r\nand 1737,[1] although no critical edition appeared until Tyrwhitt's in\r\n1775-78.  It is probable, however, that the general reader, if he read\r\nChaucer at all, read him in such modernized versions as Dryden's \"Fables\"\r\nand Pope's \"January and May.\"  Dryden's preface has some admirable\r\ncriticism of Chaucer, although it is evident, from what he says about the\r\nold poet's versification, that the secret of Middle English scansion and\r\npronunciation had already been lost.  Prior and Pope, who seem to have\r\nbeen attracted chiefly to the looser among the \"Canterbury Tales,\" made\r\neach a not very successful experiment at burlesque imitation of\r\nChaucerian language.\r\n\r\nOutside of Chaucer, and except among antiquarians and professional\r\nscholars, there was no remembrance of the whole _corpus poetarum_ of the\r\nEnglish Middle Age: none of the metrical romances, rhymed chronicles,\r\nsaints' legends, miracle plays, minstrel ballads, verse homilies, manuals\r\nof devotion, animal fables, courtly or popular allegories and love songs\r\nof the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries.  Nor was there\r\nany knowledge or care about the masterpieces of medieval literature in\r\nother languages than English; about such representative works as the\r\n\"Nibelungenlied,\" the \"Chanson de Roland,\" the \"Roman de la Rose,\" the\r\n\"Parzival\" of Wolfram von Eschenbach, the \"Tristan\" of Gottfried of\r\nStrasburg, the \"Arme Heinrich\" of Harmann von Aue, the chronicles of\r\nVillehardouin, Joinville, and Froissart, the \"Morte Artus,\" the \"Dies\r\nIrae,\" the lyrics of the troubadour Bernart de Ventadour, and of the\r\nminnesinger Walter von der Vogelweide, the Spanish Romancero, the poems\r\nof the Elder Edda, the romances of \"Amis et Amile\" and \"Aucassin et\r\nNicolete,\" the writings of Villon, the \"De Imitatione Christi\" ascribed\r\nto Thomas à Kempis. Dante was a great name and fame, but he was virtually\r\nunread.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing strange about this; many of these things were still in\r\nmanuscript and in unknown tongues, Old Norse, Old French, Middle High\r\nGerman, Middle English, Mediaeval Latin.  It would be hazardous to assert\r\nthat the general reader, or even the educated reader, of to-day has much\r\nmore acquaintance with them at first hand than his ancestor of the\r\neighteenth century; or much more acquaintance than he has with\r\nAeschuylus, Thucydides, and Lucretius, at first hand.  But it may be\r\nconfidently asserted that he knows much more _about_ them; that he thinks\r\nthem worth knowing about; and that through modern, popular versions of\r\nthem--through poems, historical romances, literary histories, essays and\r\nwhat not--he has in his mind's eye a picture of the Middle Age, perhaps\r\nas definite and fascinating as the picture of classical antiquity.  That\r\nhe has so is owing to the romantic movement.  For the significant\r\ncircumstance about the attitude of the last century toward the whole\r\nmedieval period was, not its ignorance, but its incuriosity.  It did not\r\nwant to hear anything about it.[2]  Now and then, hints Pope, an\r\nantiquarian pedant, a university don, might affect an admiration for some\r\nobsolete author:\r\n\r\n    \"Chaucer's worst ribaldry is learned by rote,\r\n    And beastly Skelton heads of houses quote:\r\n    One likes no language but the 'Faery Queen';\r\n    A Scot will fight for 'Christ's Kirk o' the Green.'\"[3]\r\n\r\nBut, furthermore, the great body of Elizabethan and Stuart literature was\r\nalready obsolescent.  Dramatists of the rank of Marlowe and Webster,\r\npoets like George Herbert and Robert Herrick--favorites with our own\r\ngeneration--prose authors like Sir Thomas Browne--from whom Coleridge and\r\nEmerson drew inspiration--had fallen into \"the portion of weeds and\r\noutworn faces.\"  Even writers of such recent, almost contemporary, repute\r\nas Donne, whom Carew had styled\r\n\r\n    \"--a king who ruled, as he thought fit,\r\n    The universal monarch of wit\":\r\n\r\nOr as Cowley, whom Dryden called the darling of his youth, and who was\r\nesteemed in his own lifetime a better poet than Milton; even Donne and\r\nCowley had no longer a following.  Pope \"versified\" some of Donne's\r\nrugged satires, and Johnson quoted passages from him as examples of the\r\nbad taste of the metaphysical poets.  This in the \"Life of Cowley,\" with\r\nwhich Johnson began his \"Lives of the Poets,\" as though Cowley was the\r\nfirst of the moderns.  But,\r\n\r\n    \"Who now reads Cowley?\"\r\n\r\nasks Pope in 1737.[4]  The year of the Restoration (1660) draws a sharp\r\nline of demarcation between the old and the new.  In 1675, the year after\r\nMilton's death, his nephew, Edward Philips, published \"Theatrum\r\nPoetarum,\" a sort of biographical dictionary of ancient and modern\r\nauthors.  In the preface, he says: \"As for the antiquated and fallen into\r\nobscurity from their former credit and reputation, they are, for the most\r\npart, those that have written beyond the verge of the present age; for\r\nlet us look back as far as about thirty or forty years, and we shall find\r\na profound silence of the poets beyond that time, except of some few\r\ndramatics.\"\r\n\r\nThis testimony is the more convincing, since Philips was something of a\r\n_laudator temporis acti_.  He praises several old English poets and\r\nsneers at several new ones, such as Cleaveland and Davenant, who were\r\nhigh in favor with the royal party.  He complains that nothing now\r\n\"relishes so well as what is written in the smooth style of our present\r\nlanguage, taken to be of late so much refined\"; that \"we should be so\r\ncompliant with the French custom, as to follow set fashions\"; that the\r\nimitation of Corneille has corrupted the English state; and that Dryden,\r\n\"complying with the modified and gallantish humour of the time,\" has, in\r\nhis heroic plays, \"indulged a little too much to the French way of\r\ncontinual rime.\"  One passage, at least, in Philips' preface has been\r\nthought to be an echo of Milton's own judgment on the pretensions of the\r\nnew school of poetry.  \"Wit, ingenuity, and learning in verse; even\r\nelegancy itself, though that comes nearest, are one thing.  True native\r\npoetry is another; in which there is a certain air and spirit which\r\nperhaps the most learned and judicious in other arts do not perfectly\r\napprehend, much less is it attainable by any study or industry.  Nay,\r\nthough all the laws of heroic poem, all the laws of tragedy were exactly\r\nobserved, yet still this _tour entrejeant_--this poetic energy, if I may\r\nso call it, would be required to give life to all the rest; which shines\r\nthrough the roughest, most unpolished, and antiquated language, and may\r\nhaply be wanting in the most polite and reformed.  Let us observe\r\nSpenser, with all his rusty, obsolete words, with all his rough-hewn\r\nclouterly verses; yet take him throughout, and we shall find in him a\r\ngraceful and poetic majesty.  In like manner, Shakspere in spite of all\r\nhis unfiled expressions, his rambling and indigested fancies--the\r\nlaughter of the critical--yet must be confessed a poet above many that go\r\nbeyond him to literature[5] some degrees.\"\r\n\r\nThe laughter of the critical!  Let us pause upon the phrase, for it is a\r\nkey to the whole attitude of the Augustan mind toward \"our old tragick\r\npoet.\"  Shakspere was already a national possession.  Indeed it is only\r\nafter the Restoration that we find any clear recognition of him, as one\r\nof the greatest--as perhaps himself the very greatest--of the dramatists\r\nof all time.  For it is only after the Restoration that criticism begins.\r\n\"Dryden,\" says Dr. Johnson, \"may be properly considered as the father of\r\nEnglish criticism, as the writer who first taught us to determine, upon\r\nprinciples, the merit of composition. . .  Dryden's 'Essay of Dramatic\r\nPoesy' [1667] was the first regular and valuable treatise on the art of\r\nwriting.\"[6]  The old theater was dead and Shakspere now emerged from\r\namid its ruins, as the one unquestioned legacy of the Elizabethan age to\r\nthe world's literature.  He was not only the favorite of the people, but\r\nin a critical time, and a time whole canons of dramatic art were opposed\r\nto his practice, he united the suffrages of all the authoritative leader\r\nof literacy opinion.  Pope's lines are conclusive as to the veneration in\r\nwhich Shakspere's memory was held a century after his death.\r\n\r\n    \"On Avon's banks, where flowers eternal blow,\r\n    If I but ask, if any weed can grow;\r\n    One tragic sentence if I dare deride\r\n    Which Betterton's grave action dignified . . .\r\n    How will our fathers rise up in a rage,\r\n    And swear, all shame is lost in George's age.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe Shaksperian tradition is unbroken in the history of English\r\nliterature and of the English theater.  His plays, in one form or\r\nanother, have always kept the stage even in the most degenerate condition\r\nof public taste.[8]  Few handsomer tributes have been paid to Shakspere's\r\ngenius than were paid in prose and verse, by the critics of our classical\r\nage, from Dryden to Johnson.  \"To begin then with Shakspere,\" says the\r\nformer, in his \"Essay of Dramatic Poesy,\" \"he was the man who, of all\r\nmodern and perhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most comprehensive\r\nsoul.\"  And, in the prologue to his adaptation of \"The Tempest,\" he\r\nacknowledges that\r\n\r\n    \"Shakspere's magic could not copied be:\r\n    Within that circle none durst walk but he.\"\r\n\r\n\"The poet of whose works I have undertaken the revision,\" writes Dr.\r\nJohnson, \"may now begin to assume the dignity of an ancient, and claim\r\nthe privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration.\"[9]\r\n\r\n    \"Each change of many-colored life he drew,\r\n    Exhausted worlds, and then imagined new.\"[10]\r\n\r\nYet Dryden made many petulant, and Johnson many fatuous mistakes about\r\nShakspere; while such minor criticasters as Thomas Rymer[11] and Mrs.\r\nCharlotte Lenox[12] uttered inanities of blasphemy about the finest\r\ntouches in \"Macbeth\" and \"Othello.\"  For if we look closer, we notice\r\nthat everyone who bore witness to Shakspere's greatness qualified his\r\npraise by an emphatic disapproval of his methods.  He was a prodigious\r\ngenius, but a most defective artist.  He was the supremest of dramatic\r\npoets, but he did not know his business.  It did not apparently occur to\r\nanyone--except, in some degree, to Johnson--that there was an absurdity\r\nin this contradiction; and that the real fault was not in Shakspere, but\r\nin the standards by which he was tried.  Here are the tests which\r\ntechnical criticism has always been seeking to impose, and they are not\r\nconfined to the classical period only.  They are used by Sidney, who took\r\nthe measure of the English buskin before Shakspere had begun to write; by\r\nJonson, who measured socks with him in his own day; by Matthew Arnold,\r\nwho wanted an English Academy, but in whom the academic vaccine, after so\r\nlong a transmission, worked but mildly.  Shakspere violated the unities;\r\nhis plays were neither right comedies nor right tragedies; he had small\r\nLatin and less Greek; he wanted art and sometimes sense, committing\r\nanachronisms and Bohemian shipwrecks; wrote hastily, did not blot enough,\r\nand failed of the grand style.  He was \"untaught, unpractised in a\r\nbarbarous age\"; a wild, irregular child of nature, ignorant of the rules,\r\nunacquainted with ancient models, succeeding--when he did succeed--by\r\nhappy accident and the sheer force of genius; his plays were\r\n\"roughdrawn,\" his plots lame, his speeches bombastic; he was guilty on\r\nevery page of \"some solecism or some notorious flaw in sense.\"[13]\r\n\r\nLangbaine, to be sure, defends him against Dryden's censure.  But Dennis\r\nregrets his ignorance of poetic art and the disadvantages under which he\r\nlay from not being conversant with the ancients.  If he had known his\r\nSallust, he would have drawn a juster picture of Caesar; and if he had\r\nread Horace \"Ad Pisones,\" he would have made a better Achilles.  He\r\ncomplains that he makes the good and the bad perish promiscuously; and\r\nthat in \"Coriolanus\"--a play which Dennis \"improved\" for the new\r\nstage--he represents Menenius as a buffoon and introduces the rabble in a\r\nmost undignified fashion.[14]  Gildon, again, says that Shakspere must\r\nhave read Sidney's \"Defence of Posey\" and therefore, ought to have known\r\nthe rules and that his neglect of them was owing to laziness.  \"Money\r\nseems to have been his aim more than reputation, and therefore he was\r\nalways in a hurry . . . and he thought it time thrown away, to study\r\nregularity and order, when any confused stuff that came into his head\r\nwould do his business and fill his house.\"[15]\r\n\r\nIt would be easy, but it would be tedious, to multiply proofs of this\r\npatronizing attitude toward Shakspere.  Perhaps Pope voices the general\r\nsentiment of his school, as fairly as anyone, in the last words of his\r\npreface.[16]  \"I will conclude by saying of Shakspere that, with all his\r\nfaults and with all the irregularity of his _drama_, one may look upon\r\nhis works, in comparison of those that are more finished and regular, as\r\nupon an ancient, majestic piece of Gothic architecture compared with a\r\nneat, modern building.  The latter is more elegant and glaring, but the\r\nformer is more strong and solemn. . .  It has much the greater variety,\r\nand much the nobler apartments, though we are often conducted to them by\r\ndark, odd and uncouth passages.  Nor does the whole fail to strike us\r\nwith greater reverence, though many of the parts are childish, ill-placed\r\nand unequal to its grandeur.\"  This view of Shakspere continued to be the\r\nrule until Coleridge and Schlegel taught the new century that this child\r\nof fancy was, in reality, a profound and subtle artist, but that the\r\nprinciples of his art--as is always the case with creative genius working\r\nfreely and instinctively--were learned by practice, in the concrete,\r\ninstead of being consciously thrown out by the workman himself into an\r\nabstract _theoria_; so that they have to be discovered by a reverent\r\nstudy of his work and lie deeper than the rules of French criticism.\r\nSchlegel, whose lectures on dramatic art were translated into English in\r\n1815, speaks with indignation of the current English misunderstanding of\r\nShakspere.  \"That foreigners, and Frenchmen in particular, who frequently\r\nspeak in the strangest language about antiquity and the Middle Age, as if\r\ncannibalism had been first put an end in Europe by Louis XIV., should\r\nentertain this opinion of Shakspere might be pardonable.  But that\r\nEnglishmen should adopt such a calumniation . . . is to me\r\nincomprehensible.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of the romantic movement in England were uncertain.  There\r\nwas a vague dissent from current literary estimates, a vague discontent\r\nwith reigning literary modes, especially with the merely intellectual\r\npoetry then in vogue, which did not feed the soul.  But there was, at\r\nfirst, no conscious, concerted effort toward something of creative\r\nactivity.  The new group of poets, partly contemporaries of Pope, partly\r\nsuccessors to him--Thomson, Shenstone, Dyer, Akenside, Gray, Collins, and\r\nthe Warton brothers--found their point of departure in the loving study\r\nand revival of old authors.  From what has been said of the survival of\r\nShakspere's influence it might be expected that his would have been the\r\nname paramount among the pioneers of English romanticism. There are\r\nseveral reasons why this was not the case.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the genius of the new poets was lyrical or\r\ndescriptive, rather than dramatic.  The divorce between literature and\r\nthe stage had not yet, indeed, become total; and, in obedience to the\r\nexpectation that every man of letters should try his hand at\r\nplay-writing, Thomson, at least, as well as his friend and disciple\r\nMallet, composed a number of dramas.  But these were little better than\r\nfailures even at the time; and while \"The Seasons\" has outlived all\r\nchanges of taste, and \"The Castle of Indolence\" has never wanted\r\nadmirers, tragedies like \"Agamemnon\" and \"Sophonisba\" have been long\r\nforgotten.  An imitation of Shakspere to any effective purpose must\r\nobviously have take the shape of a play; and neither Gray nor Collins nor\r\nAkenside, nor any of the group, was capable of a play.  Inspiration of a\r\nkind, these early romanticists did draw from Shakspere.  Verbal\r\nreminiscences of him abound in Gray.  Collins was a diligent student of\r\nhis works.  His \"Dirge in Cymbeline\" is an exquisite variation on a\r\nShaksperian theme.  In the delirium of his last sickness, he told Warton\r\nthat he had found in an Italian novel the long-sought original of the\r\nplot of \"The Tempest.\"  It is noteworthy, by the way, that the\r\nromanticists were attracted to the poetic, as distinguished from the\r\ndramatic, aspect of Shakspere's genius; to those of his plays in which\r\nfairy lore and supernatural machinery occur, such as \"The Tempest\" and \"A\r\nMidsummer Night's Dream.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, the stage has a history of its own, and, in so far as it was now\r\nmaking progress of any kind, it was not in the direction of a more poetic\r\nor romantic drama, but rather toward prose tragedy and the sentimental\r\ncomedy of domestic life, what the French call _la tragédie bourgeoise_\r\nand _la comédie larmoyante_.  In truth the theater was now dying; and\r\nthough, in the comedies of Goldsmith and Sheridan, it sent up one bright,\r\nexpiring gleam, the really dramatic talent of the century had already\r\nsought other channels in the novels of Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett.\r\n\r\nAfter all, a good enough reason why the romantic movement did not begin\r\nwith imitation of Shakspere is the fact that Shakspere is inimitable.  He\r\nhas no one manner that can be caught, but a hundred manners; is not the\r\npoet of romance, but of humanity; nor medieval, but perpetually modern\r\nand contemporaneous in his universality.  The very familiarity of his\r\nplays, and their continuous performance, although in mangled forms, was a\r\nreason why they could take little part in a literary revival; for what\r\nhas never been forgotten cannot be revived.  To Germany and France, at a\r\nlater date, Shakspere came with the shock of a discovery and begot\r\nSchiller and Victor Hugo.  In the England of the eighteenth century he\r\nbegot only Ireland's forgeries.\r\n\r\nThe name inscribed in large letters on the standard of the new school was\r\nnot Shakspere but Spenser.  If there is any poet who is _par excellence_\r\nthe poet of romance, whose art is the antithesis of Pope's, it is the\r\npoet of the \"Faërie Queene.\"  To ears that had heard from childhood the\r\ntinkle of the couplet, with its monotonously recurring rhyme, its\r\ninevitable caesura, its narrow imprisonment of the sense, it must have\r\nbeen a relief to turn to the amplitude of Spencer's stanza, \"the full\r\nstrong sail of his great verse.\"  To a generation surfeited with Pope's\r\nrhetorical devices--antithesis, climax, anticlimax--and fatigued with the\r\nunrelaxing brilliancy and compression of his language; the escape from\r\nepigrams and point (snap after snap, like a pack of fire-crackers), from\r\na style which has made his every other line a proverb or current\r\nquotation--the escape from all this into Spenser's serene, leisurely\r\nmanner, copious Homeric similes, and lingering detail must have seemed\r\nmost restful.  To go from Pope to Spenser was to exchange platitudes,\r\npacked away with great verbal cunning in neat formulas readily portable\r\nby the memory, for a wealth of concrete images: to exchange saws like,\r\n\r\n    \"A little learning is a dangerous thing,\"\r\n\r\nfor a succession of richly colored pictures by the greatest painter among\r\nEnglish poets.  It was to exchange the most prosaic of our poets--a poet\r\nabout whom question has arisen whether he is a poet at all--for the most\r\npurely poetic of our poets, \"the poet's poet.\"  And finally, it was to\r\nexchange the world of everyday manners and artificial society for an\r\nimaginary kingdom of enchantment, \"out of space, out of time.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish poetry has oscillated between the poles of Spenser and Pope.  The\r\npoets who have been accepted by the race as most truly national, poets\r\nlike Shakspere, Milton, and Byron, have stood midway.  Neither Spenser\r\nnor Pope satisfies long.  We weary, in time, of the absence of passion\r\nand intensity in Spenser, his lack of dramatic power, the want of\r\nactuality in his picture of life, the want of brief energy and nerve in\r\nhis style; just as we weary of Pope's inadequate sense of beauty.  But at\r\na time when English poetry had abandoned its true function--the\r\nrefreshment and elevation of the soul through the imagination--Spenser's\r\npoetry, the poetry of ideal beauty, formed the most natural corrective.\r\nWhatever its deficiencies, it was not, at any rate, \"conceived and\r\ncomposed in his wits.\"\r\n\r\nSpenser had not fared so well as Shakspere under the change which came\r\nover public taste after the Restoration.  The age of Elizabeth had no\r\nliterary reviews or book notices, and its critical remains are of the\r\nscantiest.  But the complimentary verses by many hands published with the\r\n\"Faërie Queene\" and the numerous references to Spenser in the whole\r\npoetic literature of the time, leave no doubt as to the fact that his\r\ncontemporaries accorded him the foremost place among English poets.  The\r\ntradition of his supremacy lasted certainly to the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, if not beyond.  His influence is visible not only in\r\nthe work of professed disciples like Giles and Phineas Fletcher, the\r\npastoral poet William Browne, and Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist,\r\nbut in the verse of Jonson, Fletcher, Milton, and many others.  Milton\r\nconfessed to Dryden that Spenser was his \"poetical father.\"  Dryden\r\nhimself and Cowley, whose practice is so remote from Spenser's,\r\nacknowledged their debt to him.  The passage from Cowley's essay \"On\r\nMyself\" is familiar: \"I remember when I began to read, and to take some\r\npleasure in it, there was wont to lie in my mother's parlour (I know not\r\nby what accident, for she herself never read any book but of\r\ndevotion--but there was wont to lie) Spenser's works.  This I happened to\r\nfall upon, and was infinitely delighted with the stories of the knights\r\nand giants and monsters and brave houses which I found everywhere there\r\n(thought my understanding had little to do with all this), and, by\r\ndegrees, with the tinkling of the rime and dance of the numbers; so that\r\nI think I had read him all over before I was twelve years old, and was\r\nthus made a poet as irremediably as a child is made an eunuch.\"  It is a\r\ncommonplace that Spenser has made more poets than any other one writer.\r\nEven Pope, whose empire he came back from Fairyland to overthrow, assured\r\nSpence that he had read the \"Faërie Queene\" with delight when he was a\r\nboy, and re-read it with equal pleasure in his last years.  Indeed, it is\r\ntoo readily assumed that writers are insensible to the beauties of an\r\nopposite school.  Pope was quite incapable of appreciating it.  He took a\r\ngreat liking to Allan Ramsay's \"Gentle Shepherd\"; he admired \"The\r\nSeasons,\" and did Thomson the honor to insert a few lines of his own in\r\n\"Summer.\"  Among his youthful parodies of old English poets is one piece\r\nentitled \"The Alley,\" a not over clever burlesque of the famous\r\ndescription of the Bower of Bliss.[18]\r\n\r\nAs for Dryden, his reverence for Spenser is qualified by the same sort of\r\ncritical disapprobation which we noticed in his eulogies of Shakspere.\r\nHe says that the \"Faërie Queene\" has no uniformity: the language is not\r\nso obsolete as is commonly supposed, and is intelligible after some\r\npractice; but the choice of stanza is unfortunate, though in spite of it,\r\nSpenser's verse is more melodious than any other English poet's except\r\nMr. Waller's.[19]  Ambrose Philips--Namby Pamby Philips--whom Thackeray\r\ncalls \"a dreary idyllic cockney,\" appealed to \"The Shepherd's Calendar\"\r\nas his model, in the introduction to his insipid \"Pastorals,\" 1709.\r\nSteele, in No. 540 of the _Spectator_ (November 19, 1712), printed some\r\nmildly commendatory remarks about Spenser.  Altogether it is clear that\r\nSpenser's greatness was accepted, rather upon trust, throughout the\r\nclassical period, but that this belief was coupled with a general\r\nindifference to his writings.  Addison's lines in his \"Epistle to\r\nSacheverel; an Account of the Greatest English Poets,\" 1694, probably\r\nrepresent accurately enough the opinion of the majority of readers:\r\n\r\n    \"Old Spenser next, warmed with poetic rage,\r\n    In ancient tales amused a barbarous age;\r\n    An age that, yet uncultivated and rude,\r\n    Wher'er the poet's fancy led, pursued,\r\n    Through pathless fields and unfrequented floods,\r\n    To dens of dragons and enchanted woods.\r\n    But now the mystic tale, that pleased of yore,\r\n    Can charm an understanding age no more.\r\n    The long-spun allegories fulsome grow,\r\n    While the dull moral lies too plain below,\r\n    We view well pleased at distance all the sights\r\n    Of arms and palfreys, battles, fields and fights,\r\n    And damsels in distress and courteous knights,\r\n    But when we look too near, the shades decay\r\n    And all the pleasing landscape fades away.\"\r\n\r\nAddison acknowledged to Spence that, when he wrote this passage, he had\r\nnever read Spenser!  As late as 1754 Thomas Warton speaks of him as \"this\r\nadmired but neglected poet,\"[20] and Mr. Kitchin asserts that \"between\r\n1650 and 1750 there are but few notices of him, and a very few editions\r\nof his works.\"[21]  There was a reprint of Spenser's works--being the\r\nthird folio of the \"Faërie Queene\"--in 1679, but no critical edition till\r\n1715.  Meanwhile the title of a book issued in 1687 shows that Spenser\r\ndid not escape that process of \"improvement\" which we have seen applied\r\nto Shakspere: \"Spenser Redivivus; containing the First Book of the 'Faëry\r\nQueene.'  His Essential Design Preserved, but his Obsolete Language and\r\nManner of Verse totally laid aside.  Delivered in Heroic Numbers by a\r\nPerson of Quality.\"  The preface praises Spenser, but declares that \"his\r\nstyle seems no less unintelligible at this day than the obsoletest of our\r\nEnglish or Saxon dialect.\"  One instance of this deliverance into heroic\r\nnumbers must suffice:\r\n\r\n    \"By this the northern wagoner had set\r\n    His sevenfold team behind the steadfast star\r\n    That was in ocean waves yet never wet,\r\n    But firm is fixed, and sendeth light from far\r\n    To all that in the wide deep wandering are.\"\r\n                   --_Spenser_.[22]\r\n\r\nIn 1715 John Hughes published his edition of Spenser's works in six\r\nvolumes.  This was the first attempt at a critical text of the poet, and\r\nwas accompanied with a biography, a glossary, an essay on allegorical\r\npoetry, and some remarks on the \"Faërie Queene.\"  It is curious to find\r\nin the engravings, from designs by Du Guernier, which illustrate Hughes'\r\nvolumes, that Spenser's knights wore the helmets and body armor of the\r\nRoman legionaries, over which is occasionally thrown something that looks\r\nvery much like a toga.  The lists in which they run a tilt have the\r\nfaçade of a Greek temple for a background.  The house of Busyrane is\r\nLouis Quatorze architecture, and Amoret is chained to a renaissance\r\ncolumn with Corinthian capital and classical draperies.  Hughes' glossary\r\nof obsolete terms includes words which are in daily use by modern\r\nwriters: aghast, baleful, behest, bootless, carol, craven, dreary,\r\nforlorn, foray, guerdon, plight, welkin, yore.  If words like these, and\r\nlike many which Warton annotates in his \"Observations,\" really needed\r\nexplanation, it is a striking proof, not only of the degree in which our\r\nolder poets had been forgotten, but also of the poverty to which the\r\nvocabulary of English poetry had been reduced by 1700.\r\n\r\nIn his prefatory remarks to the \"Faërie Queene,\" the editor expresses the\r\ncustomary regrets that the poet should have chosen so defective a stanza,\r\n\"so romantick a story,\" and a model, or framework for the whole, which\r\nappears so monstrous when \"examined by the rules of epick poetry\"; makes\r\nthe hackneyed comparison between Spenser's work and Gothic architecture,\r\nand apologizes for his author, on the ground that, at the time when he\r\nwrote, \"the remains of the old Gothick chivalry were not quite\r\nabolished.\"  \"He did not much revive the curiosity of the public,\" says\r\nJohnson, in his life of Hughes; \"for near thirty years elapsed before his\r\nedition was reprinted.\"  Editions of the \"Faërie Queene\" came thick and\r\nfast about the middle of the century.  One (by Birch) was issued in 1751,\r\nand three in 1758; including the important edition by Upton, who, of all\r\nSpenser's commentators, has entered most elaborately into the\r\ninterpretation of the allegory.\r\n\r\nIn the interval had appeared, in gradually increasing numbers, that\r\nseries of Spenserian imitations which forms an interesting department of\r\neighteenth-century verse.  The series was begun by a most unlikely\r\nperson, Matthew Prior, whose \"Ode to the Queen,\" 1706, was in a ten-lined\r\nmodification of Spenser's stanza and employed a few archaisms like _weet_\r\nand _ween_, but was very unspenserian in manner.  As early as the second\r\ndecade of the century, the horns of Elfland may be heard faintly blowing\r\nin the poems of the Rev. Samuel Croxall, the translator of Aesop's\r\n\"Fables.\"  Mr. Gosse[23] quotes Croxall's own description of his poetry,\r\nas designed \"to set off the dry and insipid stuff\" of the age with \"a\r\nwhole piece of rich and glowing scarlet.\"  His two pieces \"The Vision,\"\r\n1715, and \"The Fair Circassian,\" 1720, though written in the couplet,\r\nexhibit a rosiness of color and a luxuriance of imagery manifestly\r\nlearned from Spenser.  In 1713 he had published under the pseudonym of\r\nNestor Ironside, \"An Original Canto of Spenser,\" and in 1714 \"Another\r\nOriginal Canto,\" both, of course, in the stanza of the \"Faërie Queene.\"\r\nThe example thus set was followed before the end of the century by scores\r\nof poets, including many well-known names, like Akenside, Thomson,\r\nShenstone, and Thomas Warton, as well as many second-rate and third-rate\r\nversifiers.[24]\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that many, if not most, of the imitations were at first\r\nundertaken in a spirit of burlesque; as is plain not only from the poems\r\nthemselves, but from the correspondence of Shenstone and others.[25]  The\r\nantiquated speech of an old author is in itself a challenge to the\r\nparodist: _teste_ our modern ballad imitations.  There is something\r\nludicrous about the very look of antique spelling, and in the sound of\r\nwords like _eftsoones_ and _perdy_; while the sign _Ye Olde Booke Store_,\r\nin Old English text over a bookseller's door, strikes the public\r\ninvariably as a most merry conceited jest; especially if the first letter\r\nbe pronounced as a _y_, instead of, what it really is, a mere\r\nabbreviation of _th_.  But in order that this may be so, the language\r\ntravestied should not be too old.  There would be nothing amusing, for\r\nexample, in a burlesque imitation of Beowulf, because the Anglo-Saxon of\r\nthe original is utterly strange to the modern reader.  It is conceivable\r\nthat quick-witted Athenians of the time of Aristophanes might find\r\nsomething quaint in Homer's Ionic dialect, akin to that quaintness which\r\nwe find in Chaucer; but a Grecian of to-day would need to be very Attic\r\nindeed, to detect any provocation to mirth in the use of the genitive\r\nin-oio, in place of the genitive in-ou.  Again, as one becomes familiar\r\nwith an old author, he ceases to be conscious of his archaism: the final\r\n_e_ in Chaucer no longer strikes him as funny, nor even the circumstance\r\nthat he speaks of little birds as _smalë fowlës_.  And so it happened,\r\nthat poets in the eighteenth century who began with burlesque imitation\r\nof the \"Faërie Queen\" soon fell in love with its serious beauties.\r\n\r\nThe only poems in this series that have gained permanent footing in the\r\nliterature are Shenstone's \"Schoolmistress\" and Thomson's \"Cast of\r\nIndolence.\"  But a brief review of several other members of the group\r\nwill be advisable.  Two of them were written at Oxford in honor of the\r\nmarriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1736: one by Richard Owen\r\nCambridge;[26] the other by William Thompson, then bachelor of arts and\r\nafterward fellow of Queen's College.  Prince Fred, it will be remembered,\r\nwas a somewhat flamboyant figure in the literary and personal gossip of\r\nhis day.  He quarreled with his father, George II, who \"hated boetry and\r\nbainting,\" and who was ironically fed with soft dedication by Pope in his\r\n\"Epistle to Augustus\"; also with his father's prime minister, Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, \"Bob, the poet's foe.\"  He left the court in dudgeon and set up\r\nan opposition court of his own where he rallied about him men of letters,\r\nwho had fallen into a neglect that contrasted strangely with their former\r\nimportance in the reign of Queen Anne.  Frederick's chief ally in this\r\npolicy was his secretary, George Lord Lyttelton, the elegant if somewhat\r\namateurish author of \"Dialogues of the Dead\" and other works; the friend\r\nof Fielding, the neighbor of Shenstone at Hagley, and the patron of\r\nThomson, for whom he obtained the sinecure post of Surveyor of the\r\nLeeward Islands.\r\n\r\nCambridge's spousal verses were in a ten-lined stanza.  His \"Archimage,\"\r\nwritten in the strict Spenserian stanza, illustrates the frequent\r\nemployment of this form in occasional pieces of a humorous intention.  It\r\ndescribes a domestic boating party on the Thames, one of the oarsmen\r\nbeing a family servant and barber-surgeon, who used to dress the\r\nchaplain's hair:\r\n\r\n    \"Als would the blood of ancient beadsman spill,\r\n    Whose hairy scalps he hanged in a row\r\n    Around his cave, sad sight to Christian eyes, I trow.\"\r\n\r\nThompson's experiments, on the contrary, were quite serious.  He had\r\ngenuine poetic feeling, but little talent.  In trying to reproduce\r\nSpenser's richness of imagery and the soft modulation of his verse, he\r\nsucceeds only in becoming tediously ornate.  His stanzas are nerveless,\r\nthough not unmusical.  His college exercise, \"The Nativity,\" 1736, is a\r\nChristmas vision which comes to the shepherd boy Thomalin, as he is\r\npiping on the banks of Isis.  It employs the pastoral machinery, includes\r\na masque of virtues,--Faith, Hope, Mercy, etc.,--and closes with a\r\ncompliment to Pope's \"Messiah.\"  The preface to his \"Hymn to May,\" has\r\nsome bearing upon our inquiries:  \"As Spenser is the most descriptive and\r\nflorid of all our English writers, I attempted to imitate his manner in\r\nthe following vernal poem.  I have been very sparing of the antiquated\r\nwords which are too frequent in most of the imitations of this\r\nauthor. . .  His lines are most musically sweet, and his descriptions\r\nmost delicately abundant, even to a wantonness of painting, but still it\r\nis the music and painting of nature.  We find no ambitious ornaments or\r\nepigrammatical turns in his writings, but a beautiful simplicity which\r\npleases far above the glitter of pointed wit.\"  The \"Hymn to May\" is in\r\nthe seven-lined stanza of Phineas Fletcher's \"Purple Island\"; a poem,\r\nsays Thompson, \"scarce heard of in this age, yet the best in the\r\nallegorical way (next to 'The Fairy Queen') in the English language.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wilkie, a Scotch minister and professor, of eccentric habits and\r\nuntidy appearance, published, in 1759, \"A Dream: in the Manner of\r\nSpenser,\" which may be mentioned here not for its own sake, but for the\r\nevidence that it affords of a growing impatience of classical restraints.\r\nThe piece was a pendant to Wilkie's epic, the \"Epigoniad.\"  Walking by\r\nthe Tweed, the poet falls asleep and has a vision of Homer, who\r\nreproaches him with the bareness of style in his \"Epigoniad.\"  The\r\ndreamer puts the blame upon the critics,\r\n\r\n    \"Who tie the muses to such rigid laws\r\n    That all their songs are frivolous and poor.\"\r\n\r\nShakspere, indeed,\r\n\r\n    \"Broke all the cobweb limits fixed by fools\";\r\n\r\nbut the only reward of his boldness\r\n\r\n    \"Is that our dull, degenerate age of lead\r\n    Says that he wrote by chance, and that he scare could read.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the earlier Spenserians was Gilbert West, the translator of\r\nPindar, who published, in 1739, \"On the Abuse of Travelling: A Canto in\r\nImitation of Spenser.\"[27]  Another imitation, \"Education,\" appeared in\r\n1751.  West was a very tame poet, and the only quality of Spenser's which\r\nhe succeeded in catching was his prolixity.  He used the allegorical\r\nmachinery of the \"Faërie Queene\" for moral and mildly satirical ends.\r\nThus, in \"The Abuse of Traveling,\" the Red Cross Knight is induced by\r\nArchimago to embark in a painted boat steered by Curiosity, which wafts\r\nhim over to a foreign shore where he is entertained by a bevy of light\r\ndamsels whose leader \"hight Politessa,\" and whose blandishments the\r\nknight resists.  Thence he is conducted to a stately castle (the court of\r\nLouis XV. whose minister--perhaps Cardinal Fleury?--is \"an old and\r\nrankled mage\"); and finally to Rome, where a lady yclept Vertù holds\r\ncourt in the ruins of the Colosseum, among mimes, fiddlers, pipers,\r\neunuchs, painters, and _ciceroni_.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the canto on \"Education\" narrates how a fairy knight, while\r\nconducting his young son to the house of Paidia, encounters the giant\r\nCustom and worsts him in single combat.  There is some humor in the\r\ndescription of the stream of science into which the crowd of infant\r\nlearners are unwillingly plunged, and upon whose margin stands\r\n\r\n    \"A _birchen_ grove that, waving from the shore,\r\n    Aye cast upon the tide its falling bud\r\n    And with its bitter juice empoisoned all the flood.\"\r\n\r\nThe piece is a tedious arraignment of the pedantic methods of instruction\r\nin English schools and colleges.  A passage satirizing the artificial\r\nstyle of gardening will be cited later.  West had a country-house at\r\nWickham, in Kent, where, says Johnson,[28] \"he was very often visited by\r\nLyttelton and Pitt; who, when they were weary of faction and debates,\r\nused at Wickham to find books and quiet, a decent table and literary\r\nconversation.  There is at Wickham, a walk made by Pitt.\"  Like many\r\ncontemporary poets, West interested himself in landscape gardening, and\r\nsome of his shorter pieces belong to that literature of inscriptions to\r\nwhich Lyttelton, Akenside, Shenstone, Mason, and others contributed so\r\nprofusely.  It may be said for his Spenserian imitations that their\r\narchaisms are unusually correct[29]--if that be any praise--a feature\r\nwhich perhaps recommended them to Gray, whose scholarship in this, as in\r\nall points, was nicely accurate.  The obligation to be properly\r\n\"obsolete\" in vocabulary was one that rested heavily on the consciences\r\nof most of these Spenserian imitators.  \"The Squire of Dames,\" for\r\ninstance, by the wealthy Jew, Moses Mendez, fairly bristles with\r\nseld-seen costly words, like _benty_, _frannion_, etc., which it would\r\nhave puzzled Spenser himself to explain.\r\n\r\nOne of the pleasantest outcomes of this literary fashion was William\r\nShenstone's \"Schoolmistress,\" published in an unfinished shape in 1737\r\nand, as finally completed, in 1742.  This is an affectionate\r\nhalf-humorous description of the little dame-school of Shenstone's--and\r\nof everybody's--native village, and has the true idyllic touch.\r\nGoldsmith evidently had it in memory when he drew the picture of the\r\nschool in his \"Deserted Village.\"[30]  The application to so humble a\r\ntheme of Spenser's stately verse and grave, ancient words gives a very\r\nquaint effect.  The humor of \"The Schoolmistress\" is genuine, not\r\ndependent on the more burlesque, as in Pope's and Cambridge's\r\nexperiments; and it is warmed with a certain tenderness, as in the\r\nincident of the hen with her brood of chickens, entering the open door of\r\nthe schoolhouse in search of crumbs, and of the grief of the little\r\nsister who witnesses her brother's flogging, and of the tremors of the\r\nurchins who have been playing in the dame's absence:\r\n\r\n    \"Forewarned, if little bird their pranks behold,\r\n    'Twill whisper in her ear and all the scene unfold.\"\r\n\r\nBut the only one among the professed scholars of Spenser who caught the\r\nglow and splendor of the master was James Thomson.  It is the privilege\r\nof genius to be original even in its imitations.  Thomson took shape and\r\nhue from Spenser, but added something of his own, and the result has a\r\nvalue quite independent of its success as a reproduction.  \"The Castle of\r\nIndolence,\" 1748,[31] is a fine poem; at least the first part of it is,\r\nfor the second book is tiresomely allegorical, and somewhat involved in\r\nplot.  There is a magic art in the description of the \"land of\r\ndrowsy-head,\" with its \"listless climate\" always \"atween June and\r\nMay,\"[32] its \"stockdove's plaint amid the forest deep,\" its hillside\r\nwoods of solemn pines, its gay castles in the summer clouds, and its\r\nmurmur of the distance main.  The nucleus of Thomson's conception is to\r\nbe found in Spenser's House of Morpheus (\"Faërie Queene,\" book i. canto\r\ni. 41), and his Country of Idlesse is itself an anticipation of\r\nTennyson's Lotus Land, but verse like this was something new in the\r\npoetry of the eighteenth century:\r\n\r\n    \"Was nought around but images of rest:\r\n    Sleep-soothing groves and quiet lawns between;\r\n    And flowery beds that slumberous influence kest,\r\n    From poppies breathed; and beds of pleasant green,\r\n    Where never yet was creeping creatures seen.\r\n\r\n    \"Meantime unnumbered glittering streamlets played\r\n    And hurlëd everywhere their waters sheen;\r\n    That, as they bickered through the sunny glade,\r\n    Though restless still themselves, a lulling murmur made.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Castle of Indolence\" had the romantic iridescence, the \"atmosphere\"\r\nwhich is lacking to the sharp contours of Augustan verse.  That is to\r\nsay, it produces an effect which cannot be wholly accounted for by what\r\nthe poet says; an effect which is wrought by subtle sensations awakened\r\nby the sound and indefinite associations evoked by the words.  The secret\r\nof this art the poet himself cannot communicate.  But poetry of this kind\r\ncannot be translated into prose--as Pope's can--any more than music can\r\nbe translated into speech, without losing its essential character.  Like\r\nSpenser, Thomson was an exquisite colorist and his art was largely\r\npictorial.  But he has touches of an imagination which is rarer, if not\r\nhigher in kind, than anything in Spenser.  The fairyland of Spenser is an\r\nunreal, but hardly an unearthly region.  He seldom startles by glimpses\r\nbehind the curtain which hangs between nature and the supernatural, as in\r\nMilton's\r\n\r\n    \"Airy tongues that syllable men's names\r\n    On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something of this power in one stanza, at least, of \"The Castle\r\nof Indolence:\"\r\n\r\n    \"As when a shepherd of the Hebrid Isles,\r\n    Placed far amid the melancholy main\r\n    (Whether it be lone fancy him beguiles,\r\n    Or that aerial beings sometimes deign\r\n    To stand embodied to our sense plain),\r\n    The whilst in ocean Phoebus dips his wain,\r\n    A vast assembly moving to and fro,\r\n    Then all at once in air dissolves the wondrous show.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be guessed that Johnson and Boswell, in their tour to the Hebrides\r\nor Western Islands, saw nothing of the \"spectral puppet play\" hinted at\r\nin this passage--the most imaginative in any of Spenser's school till we\r\nget to Keats'\r\n\r\n    \"Magic casements opening on the foam\r\n    Of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Julius Mickle, the translator of the \"Lusiad,\" was a more\r\nconsiderable poet than any of the Spenserian imitators thus far reviewed,\r\nwith the exception of Thomson and the possible exception of Shenstone.\r\nHe wrote at least two poems that are likely to be remembered.  One of\r\nthese was the ballad of \"Cumnor Hall\" which suggested Scott's\r\n\"Kenilworth,\" and came near giving its name to the novel.  The other was\r\nthe dialect song of \"The Mariner's Wife,\" which Burns admired so greatly:\r\n\r\n    \"Sae true his heart, sae smooth his speech,\r\n      His breath like caller air,\r\n    His very foot has music in't,\r\n      As he comes up the stair,\r\n    For there's nae luck about the house,\r\n      There is nae luck at a',\r\n    There's little pleasure in the house\r\n      When our gudeman's awa',\"[33]\r\n\r\nMickle, like Thomson, was a Scotchman who came to London to push his\r\nliterary fortunes.  He received some encouragement from Lyttelton, but\r\nwas disappointed in his hopes of any substantial aid from the British\r\nMaecenas.  His biographer informs us that \"about his thirteenth year, on\r\nSpenser's 'Faërie Queene' falling accidentally in his way, he was\r\nimmediately struck with the picturesque descriptions of that much admired\r\nancient bard and powerfully incited to imitate his style and manner.\"[34]\r\nIn 1767 Mickle published \"The Concubine,\" a Spenserian poem in two\r\ncantos.  In the preface to his second edition, 1778, in which the title\r\nwas changed to \"Syr Martyn,\" he said that: \"The fullness and wantonness\r\nof description, the quaint simplicity, and, above all, the ludicrous, of\r\nwhich the antique phraseology and manner of Spenser are so happily and\r\npeculiarly susceptible, inclined him to esteem it not solely as the best,\r\nbut the only mode of composition adapted to his subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Syr Martyn\" is a narrative poem not devoid of animation, especially\r\nwhere the author forgets his Spenser.  But in the second canto he feels\r\ncompelled to introduce an absurd allegory, in which the nymph Dissipation\r\nand her henchman Self-Imposition conduct the hero to the cave of\r\nDiscontent.  This is how Mickle writes when he is thinking of the \"Faërie\r\nQueene\":\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Eke should he, freed from fous enchanter's spell,\r\n    Escape his false Duessa's magic charms,\r\n    And folly quaid, yclept an hydra fell\r\n    Receive a beauteous lady to his arms;\r\n    While bards and minstrels chaunt the soft alarms\r\n    Of gentle love, unlike his former thrall:\r\n    Eke should I sing, in courtly cunning terms,\r\n    The gallant feast, served up by seneschal,\r\n    To knights and ladies gent in painted bower or hall.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this is how he writes when he drops his pattern:\r\n\r\n    \"Awake, ye west winds, through the lonely dale,\r\n    And, Fancy, to thy faerie bower betake!\r\n    Even now, with balmy freshness, breathes the gale,\r\n    Dimpling with downy wing the stilly lake;\r\n    Through the pale willows faltering whispers wake,\r\n    And evening comes with locks bedropt with dew;\r\n    On Desmond's moldering turrets slowly shake\r\n    The trembling rye-grass and the harebell blue,\r\n    And ever and anon fair Mulla's plaints renew.\"\r\n\r\nA reader would be guilty of no very bad guess who should assign this\r\nstanza--which Scott greatly admired--to one of he Spenserian passages\r\nthat prelude the \"Lady of the Lake.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is needless to extend this catalogue any farther.  By the middle\r\nof the century Spenserian had become so much the fashion as to provoke a\r\nrebuke from Dr. Johnson, who prowled up and down before the temple of the\r\nBritish Muses like a sort of classical watch-dog.  \"The imitation of\r\nSpenser,\" said the _Rambler_ of May 14, 1751, \"by the influence of some\r\nmen of learning and genius, seems likely to gain upon the age. . .  To\r\nimitate the fictions and sentiments of Spenser can incur no reproach, for\r\nallegory is perhaps one of the most pleasing vehicles of instruction.\r\nBut I am very far from extending the same respect to his diction or his\r\nstanza.  His style was, in his own words and peculiarities of phrase, and\r\nso remote from common use that Jonson boldly pronounces him _to have\r\nwritten no language_.  His stanza is at once difficult and unpleasing:\r\ntiresome to the ear by its uniformity, and to the attention by its\r\nlength. . .  Life is surely given us for other purposes than to gather\r\nwhat our ancestors have wisely thrown away and to learn what is of no\r\nvalue but because it has been forgotten.\"[35]  In his \"Life of West,\"\r\nJohnson says of West's imitations of Spenser, \"Such compositions are not\r\nto be reckoned among the great achievements of intellect, because their\r\neffect is local and temporary: they appeal not to reason or passion, but\r\nto memory, and presuppose an accidental or artificial state of mind.  An\r\nimitation of Spenser is nothing to a reader, however acute, by whom\r\nSpenser has never been perused.\"\r\n\r\nThe critic is partly right.  The nice points of a parody are lost upon a\r\nreader unacquainted with the thing parodied.  And as for serious\r\nimitations, the more cleverly a copyist follows his copy, the less value\r\nhis work will have.  The eighteenth-century Spenserians, like West,\r\nCambridge, and Lloyd, who stuck most closely to their pattern, oblivion\r\nhas covered.  Their real service was done in reviving a taste for a\r\nbetter kind of poetry than the kind in vogue, and particularly in\r\nrestoring to English verse a stanza form, which became so noble an\r\ninstrument in the hands of later poets, who used it with as much freedom\r\nand vigor as if they had never seen the \"Faërie Queene.\"  One is seldom\r\nreminded of Spenser while reading \"Childe Harold\"[36] or \"Adonais\" or\r\n\"The Eve of Saint Agnes\"; but in reading West or Cambridge, or even in\r\nreading Shenstone and Thomson, one is reminded of him at every turn.  Yet\r\nif it was necessary to imitate anyone, it might be answered to Dr.\r\nJohnson that it was better to imitate Spenser than Pope.  In the\r\nimitation of Spenser lay, at least, a future, a development; while the\r\nimitation of Pope was conducting steadily toward Darwin's \"Botanic\r\nGarden.\"\r\n\r\nIt remains to notice one more document in the history of this Spenserian\r\nrevival, Thomas Warton's \"Observations on the Faërie Queen,\" 1754.\r\nWarton wrote with a genuine delight in his subject.  His tastes were\r\nfrankly romantic.  But the apologetic air which antiquarian scholars\r\nassumed, when venturing to recommend their favorite studies to the\r\nattention of a classically minded public, is not absent from Warton's\r\ncommentary.  He writes as if he felt the pressure of an unsympathetic\r\natmosphere all about him.  \"We who live in the days of writing by rule\r\nare apt to try every composition by those laws which we have been taught\r\nto think the sole criterion of excellence.  Critical taste is universally\r\ndiffused, and we require the same order and design which every modern\r\nperformance is expected to have, in poems where they never were regarded\r\nor intended. . .  If there be any poem whose graces please because they\r\nare situated beyond the reach of art[37] . . . it is this.  In reading\r\nSpenser, if the critic is not satisfied, yet the reader is transported.\"\r\n\"In analyzing the plan and conduct of this poem, I have so far tried it\r\nby epic rules, as to demonstrate the inconveniences and incongruities\r\nwhich the poet might have avoided, had he been more studious of design\r\nand uniformity.  It is true that his romantic materials claim great\r\nliberties; but no materials exclude order and perspicacity.\"  Warton\r\nassures the reader that Spenser's language is not \"so difficult and\r\nobsolete as it is generally supposed to be;\" and defends him against\r\nHume's censure,[38] that \"Homer copied true natural manners . . . but the\r\npencil of the English poet was employed in drawing the affectations and\r\nconceits and fopperies of chivalry.\"\r\n\r\nYet he began his commentary with the stock denunciations of \"Gothic\r\nignorance and barbarity.\"  \"At the renaissance it might have been\r\nexpected that, instead of the romantic manner of poetical\r\ncomposition . . . a new and more legitimate taste of writing would have\r\nsucceeded. . .  But it was a long time before such a change was effected.\r\nWe find Ariosto, many years after the revival of letters, rejecting truth\r\nfor magic, and preferring the ridiculous and incoherent excursions of\r\nBoiardo to the propriety and uniformity of the Grecian and Roman models.\r\nNor did the restoration of ancient learning produce any effectual or\r\nimmediate improvement in the state of criticism.  Beni, one of the most\r\ncelebrated critics of the sixteenth century, was still so infatuated with\r\na fondness for the old Provençal vein, that he ventured to write a\r\nregular dissertation, in which he compares Ariosto with Homer.\"  Warton\r\nsays again, of Ariosto and the Italian renaissance poets whom Spenser\r\nfollowed, \"I have found no fault in general with their use of magical\r\nmachinery; notwithstanding I have so far conformed to the reigning maxims\r\nof modern criticism as to recommend classical propriety.\"\r\nNotwithstanding this prudent determination to conform, the author takes\r\nheart in his second volume to speak out as follows about the\r\npseudo-classic poetry of his own age: \"A poetry succeeded in which\r\nimagination gave way to correctness, sublimity of description to delicacy\r\nof sentiment, and majestic imagery to conceit and epigram.  Poets began\r\nnow to be more attentive to words than to things and objects.  The nicer\r\nbeauties of happy expression were preferred to the daring strokes of\r\ngreat conception.  Satire, that bane of the sublime, was imported from\r\nFrance.  The muses were debauched at court; and polite life and familiar\r\nmanners became their only themes.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time these words were written Spenser had done his work.  Color,\r\nmusic, fragrance were stealing back again into English song, and\r\n\"golden-tongued romance with serene lute\" stood at the door of the new\r\nage, waiting for it to open.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A small portion of \"The Canterbury Tales.\"  Edited by Morell.\r\n\r\n[2] The sixteenth [_sic. Quaere_, seventeenth?] century had an instinctive\r\nrepugnance for the crude literature of the Middle Ages, the product of so\r\nstrange and incoherent a civilization.  Here classicism finds nothing but\r\ngrossness and barbarism, never suspecting that it might contain germs,\r\nwhich, with time and genius, might develop into a poetical growth,\r\ndoubtless less pure, but certainly more complex in its harmonies, and of\r\na more expressive form of beauty.  The history of our ancient poetry,\r\ntraced in a few lines by Boileau, clearly shows to what degree he either\r\nignored or misrepresented it.  The singular, confused architecture of\r\nGothic cathedrals gave those who saw beauty in symmetry of line and\r\npurity of form but further evidence of the clumsiness and perverted taste\r\nof our ancestors. All remembrances of the great poetic works of the\r\nMiddle Ages is completely effaced.  No one supposes in those barbarous\r\ntimes the existence of ages classical also in their way; no one imagines\r\neither their heroic songs or romances of adventure, either the rich\r\nbounty of lyrical styles or the naïve, touching crudity of the Christian\r\ndrama.  The seventeenth century turned disdainfully away from the\r\nmonuments of national genius discovered by it; finding them sometimes\r\nshocking in their rudeness, sometimes puerile in their refinements.\r\nThese unfortunate exhumations, indeed, only serve to strengthen its cult\r\nfor a simple, correct beauty, the models of which are found in Greece and\r\nRome.  Why dream of penetrating the darkness of our origin?  Contemporary\r\nsociety is far too self-satisfied to seek distraction in the study of a\r\npast which it does not comprehend.  The subjects and heroes of domestic\r\nhistory are also prohibited.

The fact mentioned by Macaulay, that Sir Wm. Temple's\r\n\"Essay on Ancient and Modern Learning\" names none of the four, is without\r\nimportance.  Temple refers by name to only three English \"wits,\" Sidney,\r\nBacon, and Selden.  This very superficial performance of Temple's was a\r\ncontribution to the futile controversy over the relative merits of the\r\nancients and moderns, which is now only of interest as having given\r\noccasion to Bentley to display his great scholarship in his \"Dissertation\r\non the Epistles of Phalaris,\" (1698), and to Swift to show his powers of\r\nirony in \"The Battle of the Books\" (1704).\r\n\r\n[9] Preface to the \"Plays of Shakspere,\" 1765.\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] Prologue, spoken by Garrick at the opening of Drury Lane Theater,\r\n1747.\r\n\r\n[11] \"The Tragedies of the Last Age Considered and Examined,\" 1678.\r\n\r\n[12] \"Shakspere Illustrated,\" 1753.\r\n\r\n[13] See Dryden's \"Grounds of Criticism in Tragedy\" and \"Defence of the\r\nEpilogue to the Conquest of Granada.\"\r\n\r\n[14] \"Essay on the Genius and Writings of Shakspere,\" 1712.\r\n\r\n[15] \"The Art of Poetry,\" pp. 63 and 99.  _Cf_.

I have a peculiar pleasure in mentioning two of them, 'The\r\nSchoolmistress' by Mr. Shenstone, and 'The Education of Achilles' by Mr.\r\nBedingfield.  And also, Dr. Beattie's charming 'Minstrel.'

Yet we may accept, with some\r\nqualification, the truth of Professor McClintock's statement, that the\r\n\"beginning and presence of a creative, romantic movement is almost always\r\nshown by the love, study, and interpretation of physical nature.\"[1]  Why\r\nthis should be true, at all events of the romantic movement that began in\r\nthe eighteenth century, is obvious enough.  Ruskin and Leslie Stephen\r\nhave already been quoted, as witnesses to the fact that naturalism and\r\nromanticism had a common root:  the desire, namely, to escape into the\r\nfresh air and into freer conditions, from a literature which dealt, in a\r\nstrictly regulated way, with the indoor life of a highly artificial\r\nsociety.  The pastoral had ceased to furnish any relief.  Professing to\r\nchant the praises of innocence and simplicity, it had become itself\r\nutterly unreal and conventional, in the hands of cockneys like Philips\r\nand Pope.  When the romantic spirit took possession of the poetry of\r\nnature, it manifested itself in a passion for wildness, grandeur,\r\nsolitude.  Of this there was as yet comparatively little even in the\r\nverse of Thomson, Shenstone, Akenside, and Dyer.\r\n\r\nStill the work of these pioneers in the \"return to nature\" represents the\r\ntransition, and must be taken into account in any complete history of the\r\nromantic movement.  The first two, as we have seen, were among the\r\nearliest Spenserians: Dyer was a landscape painter, as well as a poet;\r\nand Shenstone was one of the best of landscape gardeners.  But it is the\r\nbeginnings that are important.  It will be needless to pursue the history\r\nof nature poetry into its later developments; needless to review the\r\nwritings of Cowper and Crabbe, for example,--neither of whom was romantic\r\nin any sense,--or even of Wordsworth, the spirit of whose art, as a\r\nwhole, was far from romantic.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the writers above named, one by one, it will be well to\r\nnotice the general change in the forms of verse, which was an outward\r\nsign of the revolution in poetic feeling.  The imitation of Spenser was\r\nonly one instance of a readiness to lay aside the heroic couplet in favor\r\nof other kinds which it had displaced, and in the interests of greater\r\nvariety. \"During the twenty-five years,\" says Mr. Goss, \"from the\r\npublication of Thomson's 'Spring' ['Winter'] in 1726, to that of Gray's\r\n'Elegy' in 1751, the nine or ten leading poems or collections of verse\r\nwhich appeared were all of a new type; somber, as a rule, certainly\r\nstately, romantic in tone to the extreme, prepared to return, ignorantly\r\nindeed, but with respect, to what was 'Gothic' in manners, architecture,\r\nand language; all showing a more or less vague aspiration towards the\r\nnature, and not one composed in the heroic couplet hitherto so vigorously\r\nimposed on serious verse.  'The Seasons,' 'Night Thoughts' and 'The\r\nGrave' are written in blank verse: 'The Castle of Indolence' and 'The\r\nSchoolmistress' in Spenserian stanza; 'The Spleen' and 'Grongar Hill' in\r\noctosyllabics, while the early odes of Gray and those of Collins are\r\ncomposed in a great variety of simple but novel lyric measures.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe only important writer who had employed blank verse in undramatic\r\npoetry between the publication of \"Paradise Regained\" in 1672, and\r\nThomson's \"Winter\" in 1726, was John Philips.  In the brief prefatory\r\nnote to \"Paradise Lost,\" the poet of \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso,\"\r\nforgetting or disdaining the graces of his youthful muse, had spoken of\r\nrhyme as \"the invention of a barbarous age,\" as \"a thing trivial and of\r\nno true musical delight.\"  Milton's example, of course, could not fail to\r\ngive dignity and authority to the majestic rhythm that he had used; and\r\nPhilips' mock-heroic \"The Splendid Shilling\" (1701), his occasional\r\npiece, \"Blenheim\" (1705), and his Georgic \"Cyder\" (1706), were all avowed\r\nimitation of Milton.  But the well-nigh solitary character of Philips'\r\nexperiments was recognized by Thomson, in his allusion to the last-named\r\npoem:\r\n\r\n    \"Philips, Pomona's bard, the second thou\r\n    Who nobly durst, in rime-unfettered verse,\r\n    With British freedom sing the British song.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Philips' imitations of Milton, Johnson said that if the\r\nlatter \"had written after the improvements made by Dryden, it is\r\nreasonable to believe he would have admitted a more pleasing modulation\r\nof numbers into his work.\"[4]  Johnson hated Adam Smith, but when Boswell\r\nmentioned that Smith, in his rhetorical lectures at Glasgow University,\r\nhad given the preference to rhyme over blank verse, the doctor exclaimed,\r\n\"Sir, I was once in company with Smith and we did not take to each other;\r\nbut had I known that he loved rhyme as much as you tell me he does, I\r\nshould have hugged him.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1725 James Thomson, a young Scotchman, came to London to push his\r\nliterary fortunes.  His countryman, David Malloch,--or Mallet, as he\r\ncalled himself in England,--at that time private tutor in the family of\r\nthe Duke of Montrose, procured Thomson introductions into titled society,\r\nand helped him to bring out \"Winter,\" the first installment of \"The\r\nSeasons,\" which was published in 1726.  Thomson's friend and biographer\r\n(1762) the Rev. Patrick Murdoch, says that the poem was \"no sooner read\r\nthan universally admired; those only excepted who had not been used to\r\nfeel, or to look for anything in poetry beyond a _point_ of satirical or\r\nepigrammatic wit, a smart antithesis richly trimmed with rhyme.\"  This is\r\na palpable hit at the stronger contrast than between Thomson and Pope,\r\nnot alone in subject and feeling, but in diction and verse.  Thomson's\r\nstyle is florid and luxuriant, his numbers flowing and diffuse, while\r\nPope had wonted the English ear to the extreme of compression in both\r\nlanguage and meter.  Pope is among the most quotable of poets, while\r\nThomson's long poem, in spite of its enduring popularity, has contributed\r\nbut a single phrase to the stock of current quotation:\r\n\r\n    \"To teach the young idea how to shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Winter\" was followed by \"Summer\" in 1727, \"Spring\" in 1728, and the\r\ncompleted \"Seasons\" in 1730.  Thomson made many changes and additions in\r\nsubsequent editions.  The original \"Seasons\" contained only 3902 lines\r\n(exclusive of the \"Hymn\"), while the author's final revision of 1746 gave\r\n5413.  One proof that \"The Seasons\" was the work of a fresh and\r\nindependent genius is afforded by the many imitations to which it soon\r\ngave birth.  In Germany, a passage from Brockes' translation (1745) was\r\nset to music by Haydn.  J. P. Uz (1742) and Wieland each produced a\r\n\"Frühling,\" in Thomson's manner; but the most distinguished of his German\r\ndisciples was Ewald Christian von Kleist, whose \"Fruhling\" (1749) was a\r\ndescription of a country walk in spring, in 460 hexameter lines,\r\naccompanied, as in Thomson's \"Hymn,\" with a kind of \"Gloria in excelsis,\"\r\nto the creator of nature.  \"The Seasons\" was translated into French by\r\nMadame Bontemps in 1759, and called forth, among other imitations, \"Les\r\nSaisons\" of Saint Lambert, 1769 (revised and extended in 1771.)  In\r\nEngland, Thomson's influence naturally manifested itself less in direct\r\nimitations of the scheme of his poem than in the contagion of his manner,\r\nwhich pervades the work of many succeeding poets, such as Akenside,\r\nArmstrong, Dyer, Somerville and Mallet.  \"There was hardly one verse\r\nwriter of any eminence,\" says Gosse,[5] \"from 1725-50, who was not in\r\nsome manner guided or biased by Thomson, whose genius is to this day\r\nfertile in English literature.\"\r\n\r\nWe have grown so accustomed to a more intimate treatment and a more\r\nspiritual interpretation of nature, that we are perhaps too apt to\r\nundervalue Thomson's simple descriptive or pictorial method.  Compared\r\nwith Wordsworth's mysticism, with Shelley's passionate pantheism, with\r\nByron's romantic gloom in presence of the mountains and the sea, with\r\nKeats' joyous re-creation of mythology, with Thoreau's Indian-like\r\napproach to the innermost arcana--with a dozen other moods familiar to\r\nthe modern mind--it seems to us unimaginative.  Thomson has been likened,\r\nas a colorist, to Rubens; and possibly the glow, the breadth, and the\r\nvital energy of his best passages, as of Rubens' great canvases, leave\r\nour finer perceptions untouched, and we ask for something more esoteric,\r\nmore intense.  Still there are permanent and solid qualities in Thomson's\r\nlandscape art, which can give delight even now to an unspoiled taste.  To\r\na reader of his own generation, \"The Seasons\" must have come as the\r\nrevelation of a fresh world of beauty.  Such passages as those which\r\ndescribe the first spring showers, the thunderstorm in summer, the\r\ntrout-fishing, the sheep-washing, and the terrors of the winter night,\r\nwere not only strange to the public of that day, but were new in English\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nThat the poet was something of a naturalist, who wrote lovingly and with\r\nhis \"eye upon the object,\" is evident from a hundred touches, like\r\n\"auriculas with shining meal\";\r\n\r\n    \"The yellow wall-flower stained with iron brown;\"\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n    \"The bittern knows his time, with bill engulfed,\r\n    To shake the sounding marsh.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThomson's scenery was genuine.  His images of external nature are never\r\nfalse and seldom vague, like Pope's.  In a letter to Lyttelton,[7] he\r\nspeaks of \"the Muses of the great simple country, not the little\r\nfine-lady Muses of Richmond Hill.\"  His delineations, if less sharp and\r\nfinished in detail than Cowper's, have greater breadth.  Coleridge's\r\ncomparison of the two poets is well known: \"The love of nature seems to\r\nhave led Thomson to a cheerful religion, and a gloomy religion to have\r\nled Cowper to a love of nature. . .  In chastity of diction and the\r\nharmony of blank verse, Cowper leaves Thomson immeasurably below him; yet\r\nI still feel the latter to have been the born poet.\"\r\n\r\nThe geologist Hugh Miller, who visited Lyttelton's country seat at Hagley\r\nin 1845, describes the famous landscape which Thomson had painted in\r\n\"Spring\":\r\n\r\n    \"Meantime you gain the height from whose fair brow\r\n    The bursting prospect spreads immense around,\r\n    And, snatched o'er hill and dale and wood and lawn,\r\n    And verdant field and darkening heath between,\r\n    And villages embosomed soft in trees,\r\n    And spiry town, by surging columns marked\r\n    Of household smoke, your eye extensive roams. . .\r\n    To where the broken landscape, by degrees\r\n    Ascending, roughens into rigid hills,\r\n    O'er which the Cambrian mountains, like far clouds,\r\n    That skirt the blue horizon, dusky rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"That entire prospect,\" says Miller,[8]--\"one of the finest in England,\r\nand eminently characteristic of what is best in English scenery--enabled\r\nme to understand what I had used to deem a peculiarity--in some measure a\r\ndefect--in the landscapes of the poet Thomson.  It must have often struck\r\nthe Scotch reader that, in dealing with very extended prospects, he\r\nrather enumerates than describes.  His pictures are often mere\r\ncatalogues, in which single words stand for classes of objects, and in\r\nwhich the entire poetry seems to consist in an overmastering sense of\r\nvast extent, occupied by amazing multiplicity. . .  Now the prospect from\r\nthe hill at Hagley furnished me with the true explanation of this\r\nenumerative style.  Measured along the horizon, it must, on the lowest\r\nestimate, be at least fifty miles in longitudinal extent; measured\r\nlaterally, from the spectator forwards, at least twenty. . .  The real\r\narea must rather exceed than fall short of a thousand square miles: the\r\nfields into which it is laid out are small, scarcely averaging a square\r\nfurlong in superficies. . .  With these there are commixed innumerable\r\ncottages, manor-houses, villages, towns.  Here the surface is dimpled by\r\nunreckoned hollows; there fretted by uncounted mounds; all is amazing,\r\noverpowering multiplicity--a multiplicity which neither the pen nor the\r\npencil can adequately express; and so description, in even the hands of a\r\nmaster, sinks into mere enumeration. The picture becomes a catalogue.\"\r\n\r\nWordsworth[9] pronounced \"The Seasons\" \"a work of inspiration,\" and said\r\nthat much of it was \"written from himself, and nobly from himself,\" but\r\ncomplained that the style was vicious.  Thomson's diction is, in truth,\r\nnot always worthy of his poetic feeling and panoramic power over\r\nlandscape.  It is academic and often tumid and wordy, abounding in\r\nLatinisms like _effusive_, _precipitant_, _irriguous_, _horrific_,\r\n_turgent_, _amusive_.  The lover who hides by the stream where his\r\nmistress is bathing--that celebrated \"serio-comic bathing\"--is described\r\nas \"the latent Damon\"; and when the poet advises against the use of worms\r\nfor trout bait, he puts it thus:\r\n\r\n    \"But let not on your hook the tortured worm\r\n    Convulsive writhe in agonizing folds,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe poets had now begun to withdraw from town and go out into the\r\ncountry, but in their retirement to the sylvan shades they were\r\naccompanied sometimes, indeed, by Milton's \"mountain nymph, sweet\r\nLiberty,\" but quite as frequently by Shenstone's nymph, \"coy Elegance,\"\r\nwho kept reminding them of Vergil.\r\n\r\nThomson's blank verse, although, as Coleridge says, inferior to Cowper's,\r\nis often richly musical and with an energy unborrowed of Milton--as\r\nCowper's is too apt to be, at least in his translation of Homer.[10]  Mr.\r\nSaintsbury[11] detects a mannerism in the verse of \"The Seasons,\" which\r\nhe illustrates by citing three lines with which the poet \"caps the climax\r\nof three several descriptive passages, all within the compass of half a\r\ndozen pages,\" viz.:\r\n\r\n    \"And Egypt joys beneath the spreading wave.\"\r\n    \"And Mecca saddens at the long delay.\"\r\n    \"And Thule bellows through her utmost isles.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to add many other instances of this type of climacteric\r\nline, _e.g. _(\"Summer,\" 859),\r\n\r\n    \"And Ocean trembles for his green domain.\"\r\n\r\nFor the blank verse of \"The Seasons\" is a blank verse which has been\r\npassed through the strainer of the heroic couplet.  Though Thomson, in\r\nthe flow and continuity of his measure, offers, as has been said, the\r\ngreatest contrast to Pope's system of versification; yet wherever he\r\nseeks to be nervous, his modulation reminds one more of Pope's\r\nantithetical trick than of Shakspere's or Milton's freer structure.  For\r\ninstance (\"Spring,\" 1015):\r\n\r\n    \"Fills every sense and pants in every vein.\"\r\n\r\nor (_Ibid._ 1104):\r\n\r\n    \"Flames through the nerves and boils along the veins.\"\r\n\r\nTo relieve the monotony of a descriptive poem, the author introduced\r\nmoralizing digressions: advice to the husbandman and the shepherd after\r\nthe manner of the \"Georgics\"; compliments to his patrons, like Lyttelton,\r\nBubb Dodington, and the Countess of Hertford; and sentimental narrative\r\nepisodes, such as the stories of Damon and Musidora,[12] and Celadon and\r\nAmelia in \"Summer,\" and of Lavinia and Palemon[13] in \"Autumn\"; while\r\never and anon his eye extensive roamed over the phenomena of nature in\r\nforeign climes, the arctic night, the tropic summer, etc.  Wordsworth\r\nasserts that these sentimental passages \"are the parts of the work which\r\nwere probably most efficient in first recommending the author to general\r\nnotice.\"[14]  They strike us now as insipid enough.  But many coming\r\nattitudes cast their shadows before across the page of \"The Seasons.\"\r\nThomson's denunciation of the slave trade, and of cruelty to animals,\r\nespecially the caging of birds and the coursing of hares; his preference\r\nof country to town; his rhapsodies on domestic love and the innocence of\r\nthe Golden Age; his contrast between the misery of the poor and the\r\nheartless luxury of the rich; all these features of the poem foretoken\r\nthe sentimentalism of Sterne and Goldsmith, and the humanitarianism of\r\nCowper and Burns.  They anticipate, in particular, that half affected\r\nitch of simplicity which titillated the sensibilities of a corrupt and\r\nartificial society in the writings of Rousseau and the idyllic pictures\r\nof Bernardin de St. Pierre's \"Paul and Virginia.\"  Thomson went so far in\r\nthis vein as to decry the use of animal food in a passage which recalls\r\nGoldsmith's stanza:[15]\r\n\r\n    \"No flocks that range the valley free\r\n      To slaughter I condemn:\r\n    Taught by the power that pities me,\r\n      I learn to pity them.\"\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing was in the air.  Pope was not a sentimental person,\r\nyet even Pope had written\r\n\r\n    \"The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,\r\n    Had he thy reason, would he skip and play?\r\n    Pleased to the last, he crops the flowery food.\r\n    And licks the hand just raised to shed his blood.\"[16]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Thomson was personally averse to a leg of mutton.\r\nHis denunciations of luxury, and his praise of early rising[17] and cold\r\nbathing[18] sound rather hollow from the lips of a bard--\"more fat than\r\nbard beseems\"-who used to lie abed till noon, and who, as Savage told\r\nJohnson, \"was perhaps never in cold water in his life.\"  Johnson reports,\r\nnot without some spice of malice, that the Countess of Hertford, \"whose\r\npractice it was to invite every summer some poet into the country, to\r\nhear her verses and assist her studies,\" extended this courtesy to\r\nThomson, \"who took more delight in carousing with Lord Hertford and his\r\nfriends than assisting her ladyship's poetical operations, and therefore\r\nnever received another summons.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe romantic note is not absent from \"The Seasons,\" but it is not\r\nprominent.  Thomson's theme was the changes of the year as they affect\r\nthe English landscape, a soft, cultivated landscape of lawns, gardens,\r\nfields, orchards, sheep-walks, and forest preserves.  Only now and then\r\nthat attraction toward the savage, the awful, the mysterious, the\r\nprimitive, which marks the romantic mood in naturalistic poetry, shows\r\nitself in touches like these.\r\n\r\n    \"High from the summit of a craggy cliff,\r\n     Hung o'er the deep, such as amazing frowns\r\n     On utmost Kilda's shore, whose lonely race\r\n     Reigns the setting sun to Indian worlds.\"[20]\r\n\r\n    \"Or where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\r\n    Boils round the naked, melancholy isles\r\n    Of farthest Thule, and the Atlantic surge\r\n    Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.\"[21]\r\n\r\nCompare also the description of the thunderstorm in the mountains\r\n(\"Summer,\" 1156-68), closing with the lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Far seen the heights of heathy Cheviot blaze,\r\n     And Thule bellows through her utmost isles.\"\r\n\r\nThe Western Islands appear to have had a peculiar fascination for\r\nThomson.  The passages above quoted, and the stanza from \"The Castle of\r\nIndolence,\" cited on page 94, gave Collins the clew for his \"Ode on the\r\nSuperstitions of the Scottish Highlands,\" which contained, says Lowell,\r\nthe whole romantic school in the germ.  Thomason had perhaps found the\r\nembryon atom in Milton's \"stormy Hebrides,\" in \"Lycidas,\" whose echo is\r\nprolonged in Wordsworth's \"Solitary Reaper\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Breaking the silence of the seas\r\n    Among the farthest Hebrides.\"\r\n\r\nEven Pope--he had a soul--was not unsensitive to this, as witness his\r\n\r\n    \"Loud as the wolves, on Orcas' stormy steep,\r\n    Howl to the roarings of the Northern deep.\"[22]\r\n\r\nThe melancholy which Victor Hugo pronounces a distinguishing badge of\r\nromantic art, and which we shall see gaining more and more upon English\r\npoetry as the century advanced, is also discernible in \"The Seasons\" in a\r\npassage like the following:\r\n\r\n    \"O bear me then to vast embowering shades,\r\n    To twilight groves and visionary vales,\r\n    To weeping grottos and prophetic glooms;\r\n    Where angel-forms athwart the solemn dusk\r\n    Tremendous sweep, or seem to sweep along;\r\n    And voices more than human, through the void,\r\n    Deep-sounding, seize the enthusiastic ear;\"[23]\r\n\r\nor this, which recalls \"Il Penseroso\":\r\n\r\n    \"Now all amid the rigors of the year,\r\n    In the wild depth of winter, while without\r\n    The ceaseless winds blow ice, be my retreat\r\n    Between the groaning forest and the shore,\r\n    Beat by the boundless multitude of waves,\r\n    A rural, sheltered, solitary scene;\r\n    Where ruddy fire and beaming tapers join\r\n    To cheer the gloom.  There studious let me sit\r\n    And hold high converse with the mighty dead.\"[24]\r\n\r\nThe revival again, of the preternatural and of popular superstitions as\r\nliterary material, after a rationalizing and skeptical age, is signalized\r\nby such a passage as this:\r\n\r\n    \"Onward they pass, o'er many a panting height,\r\n    And valley sunk and unfrequented, where\r\n    At fall of eve the fairy people throng,\r\n    In various game and revelry to pass\r\n    The summer night, as village stories tell.\r\n    But far around they wander from the grave\r\n    Of him whom his ungentle fortune urged\r\n    Against his own sad breast to life the hand\r\n    Of impious violence.  The lonely tower\r\n    Is also shunned, whose mournful chambers hold,\r\n    So night-struck fancy dreams, the yelling ghost.\"\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninstructive to note the occurrence of the word _romantic_\r\nat several points in the poem:\r\n\r\n            \"glimmering shades and sympathetic glooms,\r\n    Where the dim umbrage o'er the falling stream\r\n    Romantic hangs.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThis is from a passage in which romantic love once more comes back into\r\npoetry, after its long eclipse; and in which the lover is depicted as\r\nwandering abroad at \"pensive dusk,\" or by moonlight, through groves and\r\nalong brooksides.[26]  The word is applied likewise to clouds, \"rolled\r\ninto romantic shapes, the dream of waking fancy\"; and to the scenery of\r\nScotland--\"Caledonia in romantic view.\"  In a subtler way, the feeling of\r\nsuch lines as these is romantic:\r\n\r\n    \"Breathe your still song into the reaper's heart,\r\n    As home he goes beneath the joyous moon;\"\r\n\r\nor these, of the comparative lightness of the summer night:\r\n\r\n            \"A faint, erroneous ray,\r\n    Glanced from the imperfect surfaces of things,\r\n    Flings half an image on the straining eye.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Stonehewer (June 29, 1760), Gray comments thus upon a\r\npassage from Ossian:\r\n\r\n    \"'Ghosts ride on the tempest to-night:\r\n    Sweet is their voice between the gusts of wind:\r\n    _Their songs are of other worlds._'\r\n\r\n\"Did you never observe (_while rocking winds are piping loud_) that pause,\r\nas the gust is re-collecting itself, and rising upon the ear in a shrill\r\nand plaintive note, like the soul of an Aeolian harp?  I do assure you,\r\nthere is nothing in the world so like the voice of a spirit.  Thomson had\r\nan ear sometimes; he was not deaf to this, and has described it\r\ngloriously, but given it another, different turn, and of more horror.  I\r\ncannot repeat the lines: it is in his 'Winter.'\"  The lines that Gray had\r\nin mind were probably these (191-94):\r\n\r\n    \"Then, too, they say, through all the burdened air,\r\n    Long groans are heard, shrill sounds and distant sighs\r\n    That, uttered by the demon of the night,\r\n    Warn the devoted wretch of woe and death.\"\r\n\r\nThomson appears to have been a sweet-tempered, indolent man, constant in\r\nfriendship and much loved by his friends.  He had a little house and\r\ngrounds in Kew Lane where he used to compose poetry on autumn nights and\r\nloved to listen to the nightingales in Richmond Garden; and where, sang\r\nCollins, in his ode on the poet's death (1748),\r\n\r\n    \"Remembrance oft shall haunt the shore,\r\n      When Thames in summer wreaths is drest,\r\n    And oft suspend the dashing oar\r\n      To bid his gentle spirit rest.\"\r\n\r\nCollins had been attracted to Richmond by Thomson's residence there, and\r\nforsook the neighborhood after his friend's death.\r\n\r\nJoseph Warton, in his \"Essay on Pope\" (1756), testified that \"The\r\nSeasons\" had been \"very instrumental in diffusing a taste for the\r\nbeauties of nature and landscape.\"  One evidence of this diffused taste\r\nwas the rise of the new or natural school of landscape gardening.  This\r\nwas a purely English art, and Gray, writing in 1763,[27] says \"It is not\r\nforty years since the art was born among us; and it is sure that there\r\nwas nothing in Europe like it\": he adds that \"our skill in gardening and\r\nlaying out grounds\" is \"the only taste we can call our own, the only\r\nproof of our original talent in matter of pleasure.\"  \"Neither Italy nor\r\nFrance have ever had the least notion of it, nor yet do at all comprehend\r\nit, when they see it.\"[28]  Gray's \"not forty years\" carries us back with\r\nsufficient precision to the date of \"The Seasons\" (1726-30), and it is\r\nnot perhaps giving undue credit to Thomson, to acknowledge him as, in a\r\ngreat measure, the father of the national school of landscape gardening.\r\nThat this has always been recognized upon the Continent as an art of\r\nEnglish invention, is evidenced by the names _Englische Garten_, _jardin\r\nAnglais_, still given in Germany and France to pleasure grounds laid out\r\nin the natural taste.[29]  Schopenhauer gives the philosophy of the\r\nopposing styles as follows: \"The great distinction between the English\r\nand the old French garden rests, in the last analysis, upon this, viz.,\r\nthat the former are laid out in the objective, the latter in the\r\nsubjective sense, that is to say, in the former the will of Nature, as it\r\nmanifests (_objektivirt_) itself in tree, mountain, and water, is brought\r\nto the purest possible expression of its ideas, _i.e._, of its own being.\r\nIn the French gardens, on the other hand, there is reflected only the\r\nwill of the owner who has subdued Nature, so that, instead of her own\r\nideas, she wears as tokens of her slavery, the forms which he has forced\r\nupon her-clipped hedges, trees cut into all manner of shapes, straight\r\nalleys, arched walks, etc.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair to hold the false taste of Pope's generation\r\nresponsible for that formal style of gardening which prevailed when \"The\r\nSeasons\" was written.  The old-fashioned Italian or French or Dutch\r\ngarden--as it was variously called--antedated the Augustan era, which\r\nsimply inherited it from the seventeenth century.  In Bacon's essay on\r\ngardens, as well as in the essays on the same subject by Cowley and Sir\r\nWilliam Temple, the ideal pleasure ground is very much like that which Le\r\nNotre realized so brilliantly at Versailles.[30]  Addison, in fact, in\r\nthe _Spectator_ (No. 414) and Pope himself in the _Guardian_ (No. 173)\r\nridiculed the excesses of the reigning mode, and Pope attacked them again\r\nin his description of Timon's Villa in the \"Epistle to the Earl of\r\nBurlington\" (1731), which was thought to be meant for Canons, the seat of\r\nthe Duke of Chandos.\r\n\r\n    \"His gardens next your admiration call,\r\n    On every side you look, behold the wall!\r\n    No pleasing intricacies intervene,\r\n    No artful wildness to perplex the scene;\r\n    Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother,\r\n    And half the platform just reflects the other.\r\n    The suffering eye inverted nature sees,\r\n    Trees cut to statues, statues thick as trees;\r\n    With here a fountain, never to be played;\r\n    And there a summer house, that knows no shade;\r\n    Here Amphitrite sails through myrtle bowers;\r\n    There gladiators fight, or die in flowers;\r\n    Unwatered see the drooping sea-horse mourn,\r\n    And swallows roost in Nilus' dusty urn.\"\r\n\r\nStill the criticism is not merely fanciful which discovers an analogy\r\nbetween the French garden, with its trim regularity and artificial\r\nsmoothness, and the couplets which Pope wrote: just such an analogy as\r\nexists between the whole classical school of poetry and the Italian\r\narchitecture copied from Palladio and introduced in England by Inigo\r\nJones and Christopher Wren.  Grounds were laid out in rectangular plots,\r\nbordered by straight alleys, sometimes paved with vari-colored sand, and\r\nedged with formal hedges of box and holly.  The turf was inlaid with\r\nparterres cut in geometric shapes and set, at even distances, with yew\r\ntrees clipped into cubes, cones, pyramids, spheres, sometimes into\r\nfigures of giants, birds, animals, and ships--called \"topiary work\"\r\n(_opus topiarium_).  Terraces, fountains, bowling-greens (Fr.\r\n_boulingrin_) statues, arcades, quincunxes, espallers, and artificial\r\nmazes or labyrinths loaded the scene.  The whole was inclosed by a wall,\r\nwhich shut the garden off from the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n\"When a Frenchman reads of the Garden of Eden,\" says Horace Walpole, in\r\nhis essay \"On Modern Gardening\" (written in 1770, published in 1785), \"I\r\ndo not doubt but he concludes it was something approaching to that of\r\nVersailles, with clipped hedges, _berceaux_ and trellis work. . .  The\r\nmeasured walk, the quincunx and the _étoile_ imposed their unsatisfying\r\nsameness on every royal and noble garden. . . Many French groves seem\r\ngreen chests set upon poles. . .  In the garden of Marshal de Biron at\r\nParis, consisting of fourteen acres, every walk is buttoned on each side\r\nby lines of flower-pots, which succeed in their seasons. When I saw it,\r\nthere were nine thousand pots of asters, or _la reine Marguerite_. . .\r\nAt Lady Orford's, at Piddletown, in Dorsetshire, there was, when my\r\nbrother married, a double enclosure of thirteen gardens, each I suppose\r\nnot much above a hundred yards square, with an enfilade of correspondent\r\ngates; and before you arrived at these, you passed a narrow gut between\r\ntwo stone terraces that rose above your head, and which were crowned by a\r\nline of pyradmidal yews.  A bowling green was all the lawn admitted in\r\nthose times: a circular lake the extent of magnificence.\"[31]\r\n\r\nWalpole names Theobalds and Nonsuch as famous examples of the old formal\r\nstyle of garden; Stourhead, Hagley, and Stowe--the country seat of\r\nLyttelton's brother-in-law, Lord Cobham--of the new.  He says that\r\nmottoes and coats of arms were sometimes cut in yew, box, and holly.  He\r\nrefers with respect to a recent work by the Rev. Thomas Whately, or\r\nWheatley, \"Observations on Modern Gardening,\" 1770; and to a poem, then\r\nand still in manuscript, but passages of which are given by Amherst,[32]\r\nentitled \"The Rise and Progress of the Present Taste in Planting Parks,\r\nPleasure Grounds, Gardens, etc.  In a poetic epistle to Lord Viscount\r\nIrwin,\" 1767.\r\n\r\nGray's friend and editor, the Rev. William Mason, in his poem \"The\r\nEnglish Garden,\" 1757, speaks of the French garden as already a thing of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n    \"O how unlike the scene my fancy forms,\r\n    Did Folly, heretofore, with Wealth conspire\r\n    To plant that formal, dull disjointed scene\r\n    Which once was called a garden!  Britain still\r\n    Bears on her breast full many a hideous wound\r\n    Given by the cruel pair, when, borrowing aid\r\n    From geometric skill, they vainly strove\r\n    By line, by plummet and unfeeling shears\r\n    To form with verdure what the builder formed\r\n    With stone. . .\r\n                    Hence the sidelong walls\r\n    Of shaven yew; the holly's prickly arms\r\n    Trimmed into high arcades; the tonsile box,\r\n    Wove in mosaic mode of many a curl\r\n    Around the figured carpet of the lawn. . .\r\n    The terrace mound uplifted; the long line\r\n    Deep delved of flat canal.\"[33]\r\n\r\nBut now, continues the poet, Taste \"exalts her voice\" and\r\n\r\n                    \"At the awful sound\r\n    The terrace sinks spontaneous; on the green,\r\n    Broidered with crispëd knots, the tonsile yews\r\n    Wither and fall; the fountain dares no more\r\n    To fling its wasted crystal through the sky,\r\n    But pours salubrious o'er the parchëd lawn.\"\r\n\r\nThe new school had the intolerance of reformers.  The ruthless Capability\r\nBrown and his myrmidons laid waste many a prim but lovely old garden,\r\nwith its avenues, terraces, and sun dials, the loss of which is deeply\r\ndeplored, now that the Queen Anne revival has taught us to relish the\r\n_rococo_ beauties which Brown's imitation landscapes displaced.\r\n\r\nWe may pause for a little upon this \"English Garden\" of Mason's, as an\r\nexample of that brood of didactic blank-poems, begotten of Phillips'\r\n\"Cyder\" and Thomson's \"Seasons,\" which includes Mallet's \"Excursion\"\r\n(1728), Somerville's \"Chase\" (1734), Akenside's \"Pleasures of\r\nImagination\" (1742-44), Armstrong's \"Art of Preserving Health\" (1744),\r\nDyer's \"Fleece\" (1757) and Grainger's \"Sugar Cane\" (1764).  Mason's blank\r\nverse, like Mallet's, is closely imitative of Thomson's and the influence\r\nof Thomson's inflated diction is here seen at its worst.  The whole poem\r\nis an object lesson on the absurdity of didactic poetry.  Especially\r\nharrowing are the author's struggles to be poetic while describing the\r\nvarious kinds of fences designed to keep sheep out of his inclosures.\r\n\r\n                \"Ingrateful sure,\r\n    When such the theme, becomes the poet's task:\r\n    Yet must he try by modulation meet\r\n    Of varied cadence and selected phrase\r\n    Exact yet free, without inflation bold,\r\n    To dignify that theme.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly he dignified his theme by speaking of a net as the\r\n\"sportsman's hempen toils,\" and of a gun as the\r\n\r\n                    \"--fell tube\r\n    Whose iron entrails hide the sulphurous blast\r\n    Satanic engine!\"\r\n\r\nWhen he names an ice-house, it is under a form of conundrum:\r\n\r\n        \"--the structure rude where Winter pounds,\r\n    In conic pit his congelations hoar,\r\n    That Summer may his tepid beverage cool\r\n    With the chill luxury.\"\r\n\r\nThis species of verbiage is the earmark of all eighteenth-century poetry\r\nand poets; not only of those who used the classic couplet, but equally of\r\nthe romanticizing group who adopted blank verse.  The best of them are\r\nnot free from it, not even Gray, not even Collins; and it pervades\r\nWordsworth's earliest verses, his \"Descriptive Sketches\" and \"Evening\r\nWalk\" published in 1793.  But perhaps the very worst instance of it is in\r\nDr. Armstrong's \"Economy of Love,\" where the ludicrous contrast between\r\nthe impropriety of the subject and the solemn pomp of the diction amounts\r\nalmost to _bouffe_.\r\n\r\nIn emulation of \"The Seasons\" Mason introduced a sentimental love\r\nstory--Alcander and Nerina--into his third book.  He informs his readers\r\n(book II. 34-78) that, in the reaction against straight alleys, many\r\ngardeners had gone to an extreme in the use of zigzag meanders; and he\r\nrecommends them to follow the natural curves of the footpaths which the\r\nmilkmaid wears across the pastures \"from stile to stile,\" or which\r\n\r\n                       --\"the scudding hare\r\n    Draws to her dew-sprent seat o'er thymy heaths.\"\r\n\r\nThe prose commentary on Mason's poem, by W. Burgh,[34] asserts that the\r\nformal style of garden had begun to give way about the commencement of\r\nthe eighteenth century, though the new fashion had but very lately\r\nattained to its perfection.  Mason mentions Pope as a champion of the\r\ntrue taste,[35] but the descriptions of his famous villa at Twickenham,\r\nwith its grotto, thickets, and artificial mounds, hardly suggest to the\r\nmodern reader a very successful attempt to reproduce nature.  To be sure,\r\nPope had only five acres to experiment with, and that parklike scenery\r\nwhich distinguishes the English landscape garden requires a good deal of\r\nroom.  The art is the natural growth of a country where primogeniture has\r\nkept large estates in the hands of the nobility and landed gentry, and in\r\nwhich a passion for sport has kept the nobility and gentry in the country\r\na great share of the year.  Even Shenstone--whose place is commended by\r\nMason--Shenstone at the Leasowes, with his three hundred acres, felt his\r\nlittle pleasance rather awkwardly dwarfed by the neighborhood of\r\nLyttelton's big park at Hagley.\r\n\r\nThe general principle of the new or English school was to imitate nature;\r\nto let trees keep their own shapes, to substitute winding walks for\r\nstraight alleys, and natural waterfalls or rapids for _jets d'eau_ in\r\nmarble basins. The plan upon which Shenstone worked is explained in his\r\n\"Unconnected Thoughts on Gardening\"[36] (1764), a few sentences from\r\nwhich will indicate the direction of the reform: \"Landscape should\r\ncontain variety enough to form a picture upon canvas; and this is no bad\r\ntest, as I think the landscape painter is the gardener's best designer.\r\nThe eye requires a sort of balance here; but not so as to encroach upon\r\nprobable nature.  A wood or hill may balance a house or obelisk; for\r\nexactness would be displeasing. . .  It is not easy to account for the\r\nfondness of former times for straight-lined avenues to their houses;\r\nstraight-lined walks through their woods; and, in short, every kind of\r\nstraight line, where the foot has to travel over what the eye has done\r\nbefore. . .  To stand still and survey such avenues may afford some\r\nslender satisfaction, through the change derived from perspective; but to\r\nmove on continually and find no change of scene in the least attendant on\r\nour change of place, must give actual pain to a person of taste. . .  I\r\nconceived some idea of the sensation he must feel from walking but a few\r\nminutes, immured between Lord D----'s high shorn yew hedges, which run\r\nexactly parallel at the distance of about ten feet, and are contrived\r\nperfectly to exclude all kind of objects whatsoever. . .  The side trees\r\nin vistas should be so circumstanced as to afford a probability that they\r\ngrew by nature. . .  The shape of ground, the disposition of trees and\r\nthe figure of water must be sacred to nature; and no forms must be\r\nallowed that make a discovery of art. . .  The taste of the citizen and\r\nof the mere peasant are in all respects the same: the former gilds his\r\nballs, paints his stonework and statues white, plants his trees in lines\r\nor circles, cuts his yew-trees, four-square or conic, or gives them what\r\nhe can of the resemblance of birds or bears or men; squirts up his\r\nrivulets in _jets d'eau_; in short, admires no part of nature but her\r\nductility; exhibits everything that is glaring, that implies expense, or\r\nthat effects a surprise because it is unnatural.  The peasant is his\r\nadmirer. . .  Water should ever appear as an irregular lake or winding\r\nstream. . .  Hedges, appearing as such, are universally bad.  They\r\ndiscover art in nature's province.\"\r\n\r\nThere is surely a correspondence between this new taste for picturesque\r\ngardening which preferred freedom, variety, irregularity, and naturalness\r\nto rule, monotony, uniformity, and artifice, and that new taste in\r\nliterature which discarded the couplet for blank verse, or for various\r\nstanza forms, which left the world of society for the solitudes of\r\nnature, and ultimately went, in search of fresh stimulus, to the remains\r\nof the Gothic ages and the rude fragments of Norse and Celtic antiquity.\r\n\r\nBoth Walpole and Mason speak of William Kent, the architect and landscape\r\npainter, as influential in introducing a purer taste in the gardener's\r\nart.  Kent was a friend of Pope and a _protégé_ of Lord Burlington to\r\nwhom Pope inscribed his \"Epistle on the Use of Riches,\" already quoted\r\n(see _ante_ p. 121), and who gave Kent a home at his country house.  Kent\r\nis said to have acknowledged that he caught his taste in gardening from\r\nthe descriptive passages in Spenser, whose poems he illustrated.  Walpole\r\nand Mason also unite in contrasting with the artificial gardening of\r\nMilton's time the picture of Eden in \"Paradise Lost:\"\r\n\r\n        \"--where not nice art in curious knots,\r\n    But nature boon poured forth on hill and dale\r\n    Flowers worthy of Paradise; while all around\r\n    Umbrageous grots, and caves of cool recess,\r\n    And murmuring waters, down the slope dispersed,\r\n    Or held by fringëd banks in crystal lakes.\r\n    Compose a rural seat of various hue.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is worth noting that in \"L'Allegro\" \"retired leisure,\" takes his\r\npleasure in \"_trim_ gardens,\" while in Collins,\r\n\r\n    \"Ease and health retire\r\n    To breezy lawn or forest deep.\"\r\n\r\nWalpole says that Kent's \"ruling principle was that nature abhors a\r\nstraight line.\"  Kent \"leaped the fence and saw that all nature was a\r\ngarden.  He felt the delicious contrast of hill and valley, changing\r\nimperceptibly into each other. . . and remarked how loose groves crowned\r\nan easy eminence with happy ornament. . .  The great principles on which\r\nhe worked were perspective and light and shade. . .  But of all the\r\nbeauties he added to the face of this beautiful country, none surpassed\r\nhis management of water.  Adieu to canals, circular basins, and cascades\r\ntumbling down marble steps. . .  The gentle stream was taught to\r\nserpentine seemingly at its pleasure.\"[37]  The treatment of the garden\r\nas a part of the landscape in general was commonly accomplished by the\r\nremoval of walls, hedges, and other inclosures, and the substitution of\r\nthe ha-ha or sunken fence.  It is odd that Walpole, though he speaks of\r\nCapability Brown, makes no mention of the Leasowes, whose proprietor,\r\nWilliam Shenstone, the author of \"The School-mistress,\" is one of the\r\nmost interesting of amateur gardeners.  \"England,\" says Hugh Miller, \"has\r\nproduced many greater poets than Shenstone, but she never produced a\r\ngreater landscape gardener.\"\r\n\r\nAt Oxford, Shenstone had signalized his natural tastes by wearing his own\r\nhair instead of the wig then (1732) universally the fashion.[38]  On\r\ncoming of age, he inherited a Shropshire farm, called the Leasowes, in\r\nthe parish of Hales Owen and an annuity of some three hundred pounds.  He\r\nwas of an indolent, retiring, and somewhat melancholy temperament; and,\r\ninstead of pursuing a professional career, he settled down upon his\r\nproperty and, about the year 1745, began to turn it into a _fermé ornée_.\r\nThere he wooed the rustic muse in elegy, ode, and pastoral ballad,\r\nsounding upon the vocal reed the beauties of simplicity and the vanity of\r\nambition, and mingling with these strains complaints of Delia's cruelty\r\nand of the shortness of his own purse, which hampered him seriously in\r\nhis gardening designs.  Mr. Saintsbury has described Shenstone as a\r\nmaster of \"the artificial-natural style of poetry.\"[39]  His pastoral\r\ninsipidities about pipes and crooks and kids, Damon and Delia, Strephon\r\nand Chloe, excited the scorn of Dr. Johnson, who was also at no pains to\r\nconceal his contempt for the poet's horticultural pursuits.  \"Whether to\r\nplant a walk in undulating curves and to place a bench at every turn\r\nwhere there is an object to catch the view; to make water run where it\r\nwill be seen; to leave intervals where the eye will be pleased, and to\r\nthicken the plantation where there is something to be hidden, demands any\r\ngreat powers of mind, I will not enquire.\"  The doctor reports that\r\nLyttelton was jealous of the fame which the Leasowes soon acquired, and\r\nthat when visitors to Hagley asked to see Shenstone's place, their host\r\nwould adroitly conduct them to inconvenient points of view--introducing\r\nthem, _e.g._, at the wrong end of a walk, so as to detect a deception in\r\nperspective, \"injuries of which Shenstone would heavily complain.\"[40]\r\nGraves, however, denies that any rivalry was in question between the\r\ngreat domain of Hagley and the poet's little estate.  \"The truth of the\r\ncase,\" he writes, \"was that the Lyttelton family went so frequently with\r\ntheir company to the Leasowes, that they were unwilling to break in upon\r\nMr. Shenstone's retirement on every occasion, and therefore often went to\r\nthe principal points of view, without waiting for anyone to conduct them\r\nregularly through the whole walks.  Of this Mr. Shenstone would sometimes\r\npeevishly complain.\"\r\n\r\nShenstone describes in his \"Thoughts on Gardening,\" several artifices\r\nthat he put in practice for increasing the apparent distance of objects,\r\nor for lengthening the perspective of an avenue by widening it in the\r\nforeground and planting it there with dark-foliaged trees, like yews and\r\nfirs, \"then with trees more and more fady, till they end in the\r\nalmond-willow or silver osier.\"  To have Lord Lyttelton bring in a party\r\nat the small, or willow end of such a walk, and thereby spoil the whole\r\ntrick, must indeed have been provoking.  Johnson asserts that Shenstone's\r\nhouse was ruinous and that \"nothing raised his indignation more than to\r\nask if there were any fishes in his water.\"  \"In time,\" continues the\r\ndoctor, \"his expenses brought clamors about him that overpowered the\r\nlamb's bleat and the linnet's song; and his groves were haunted by beings\r\nvery different from fawns and fairies;\" to wit, bailiffs; but Graves\r\ndenies this.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the Leasowes attracted visitors from all parts of the\r\ncountry--literary men like Spence, Home, and Dodsley; picturesque\r\ntourists, who came out of curiosity; and titled persons, who came, or\r\nsent their gardeners, to obtain hints for laying out their grounds.\r\nLyttelton brought William Pitt, who was so much interested that he\r\noffered to contribute two hundred pounds toward improvements, an offer\r\nthat Shenstone, however, declined.  Pitt had himself some skill in\r\nlandscape gardening, which he exercised at Enfield Chase and afterward at\r\nHayes.[41]  Thomson, who was Lyttelton's guest at Hagley every summer\r\nduring the last three or four years of his life, was naturally familiar\r\nwith the Leasowes.  There are many references to the \"sweet descriptive\r\nbard,\" in Shenstone's poems[42] and a seat was inscribed to his memory in\r\na part of the grounds known as Vergil's Grove.  \"This seat,\" says\r\nDodsley, \"is placed upon a steep bank on the edge of the valley, from\r\nwhich the eye is here drawn down into the flat below by the light that\r\nglimmers in front and by the sound of various cascades, by which the\r\nwinding stream is agreeably broken.  Opposite to this seat the ground\r\nrises again in an easy concave to a kind of dripping fountain, where a\r\nsmall rill trickles down a rude niche of rock work through fern,\r\nliverwort, and aquatic weeds. . .  The whole scene is opaque and\r\ngloomy.\"[43]\r\n\r\nEnglish landscape gardening is a noble art.  Its principles are sound and\r\nof perpetual application.  Yet we have advanced so much farther in the\r\npassion for nature than the men of Shenstone's day that we are apt to be\r\nimpatient of the degree of artifice present in even the most skillful\r\ncounterfeit of the natural landscape.  The poet no longer writes odes on\r\n\"Rural Elegance,\" nor sings\r\n\r\n    \"The transport, most allied to song,\r\n      In some fair valley's peaceful bound\r\n    To catch soft hints from Nature's tongue,\r\n      And bid Arcadia bloom around;\r\n    Whether we fringe the sloping hill,\r\n      Or smooth below the verdant mead;\r\n    Or in the horrid brambles' room\r\n      Bid careless groups of roses bloom;\r\n    Or let some sheltered lake serene\r\n      Reflect flowers, woods and spires, and brighten all the scene.\"\r\n\r\nIf we cannot have the mountains, the primeval forest, or the shore of the\r\nwild sea, we can at least have Thomson's \"great simple country,\" subdued\r\nto man's use but not to his pleasure.  The modern mood prefers a lane to\r\na winding avenue, and an old orchard or stony pasture to a lawn decorated\r\nwith coppices.  \"I do confess,\" says Howitt, \"that in the 'Leasowes' I\r\nhave always found so much ado about nothing; such a parade of miniature\r\ncascades, lakes, streams conveyed hither and thither; surprises in the\r\ndisposition of woods and the turn of walks. . . that I have heartily\r\nwished myself out upon a good rough heath.\"\r\n\r\nFor the \"artificial-natural\" was a trait of Shenstone's gardening no less\r\nthan of his poetry.  He closed every vista and emphasized every opening\r\nin his shrubberies and every spot that commanded a prospect with come\r\nobject which was as an exclamation point on the beauty of the scene: a\r\nrustic bench, a root-house, a Gothic alcove, a grotto, a hermitage, a\r\nmemorial urn or obelisk dedicated to Lyttelton, Thomson, Somerville,[44]\r\nDodsley, or some other friend.  He supplied these with inscriptions\r\nexpressive of the sentiments appropriate to the spot, passages from\r\nVergil, or English or Latin verses of his own composition.  Walpole says\r\nthat Kent went so far in his imitation of natural scenery as to plant\r\n_dead_ trees in Kensington Garden.  Walpole himself seems to approve of\r\nsuch devices as artificial ruins, \"a feigned steeple of a distant church\r\nor an unreal bridge to disguise the termination of water.\"  Shenstone was\r\nnot above these little effects: he constructed a \"ruinated priory\" and a\r\ntemple of Pan out of rough, unhewn stone; he put up a statue of a piping\r\nfaun, and another of the Venus dei Medici beside a vase of gold fishes.\r\n\r\nSome of Shenstone's inscriptions have escaped the tooth of time.  The\r\nmotto, for instance, cut upon the urn consecrated to the memory of his\r\ncousin, Miss Dolman, was prefixed by Byron to his \"Elegy upon Thyrza\":\r\n\"Heu quanto minus est cum reliquis versari quam tui meminisse!\"  The\r\nhabit of inscription prevailed down to the time of Wordsworth, who\r\ncomposed a number for the grounds of Sir George Beaumont at Coleorton.\r\nOne of Akenside's best pieces is his \"Inscription for a Grotto,\" which is\r\nnot unworthy of Landor.  Matthew Green, the author of \"The Spleen,\" wrote\r\na poem of some 250 lines upon Queen Caroline's celebrated grotto in\r\nRichmond Garden.  \"A grotto,\" says Johnson, apropos of that still more\r\ncelebrated one at Pope's Twickenham villa, \"is not often the wish or\r\npleasure of an Englishman, who has more frequent need to solicit than\r\nexclude the sun\"; but the increasing prominence of the mossy cave and\r\nhermit's cell, both in descriptive verse and in gardening, was\r\nsymptomatic.  It was a note of the coming romanticism, and of that\r\npensive, elegiac strain which we shall encounter in the work of Gray,\r\nCollins, and the Wartons.  It marked the withdrawal of the muse from the\r\nworld's high places into the cool sequestered vale of life.  All through\r\nthe literature of the mid-century, the high-strung ear may catch the\r\ndrip-drip of spring water down the rocky walls of the grot.\r\n\r\nAt Hagley, halfway up the hillside, Miller saw a semi-octagonal temple\r\ndedicated to the genius of Thomson.  It stood in a grassy hollow which\r\ncommanded a vast, open prospect and was a favorite resting place of the\r\npoet of \"The Seasons.\"  In a shady, secluded ravine he found a white\r\npedestal, topped by an urn which Lyttelton had inscribed to the memory of\r\nShenstone.  This contrast of situation seemed to the tourist emblematic.\r\nShenstone, he says, was an egotist, and his recess, true to his\r\ncharacter, excludes the distant landscape.  Gray, who pronounced \"The\r\nSchoolmistress\" a masterpiece in its kind, made a rather slighting\r\nmention of its author.[45]  \"I have read an 8vo volume of Shenstone's\r\nletters; poor man!  He was always wishing for money, for fame and other\r\ndistinctions; and his whole philosophy consisted in living, against his\r\nwill, in retirement and in a place which his taste had adorned, but which\r\nhe only enjoyed when people of note came to see and commend it.\"  Gray\r\nunquestionably profited by a reading of Shenstone's \"Elegies,\" which\r\nantedate his own \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" (1751).  He\r\nadopted Shenstone's stanza, which Shenstone had borrowed from the love\r\nelegies of a now forgotten poet, James Hammond, equerry to Prince\r\nFrederick and a friend of Cobham, Lyttelton, and Chesterfield.  \"Why\r\nHammond or other writers,\" says Johnson, \"have thought the quatrain of\r\nten syllables elegiac, it is difficult to tell.  The character of the\r\nelegy is gentleness and tenuity, but this stanza has been pronounced by\r\nDryden. . .to be the most magnificent of all the measures which our\r\nlanguage affords.\"[46]\r\n\r\nNext after \"The Schoolmistress,\" the most engaging of Shenstone's poems\r\nis his \"Pastoral Ballad,\" written in 1743 in four parts and in a tripping\r\nanapestic measure.  Familiar to most readers is the stanza beginning:\r\n\r\n    \"I have found out a gift for my fair,\r\n    I have found where the wood-pigeons breed.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson acknowledged the prettiness of the conceit:\r\n\r\n    \"So sweetly she bade me adieu,\r\n    I thought that she bade me return;\"\r\n\r\nand he used to quote and commend the well-known lines \"Written at an Inn\r\nat Henley:\r\n\r\n    \"Whoe'er has travell'd life's dull round,\r\n      Where'er his stages may have been,\r\n    May sigh to think he still has found\r\n      The warmest welcome at an inn.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Shenstone's blank verse--of which there is not much--the doctor\r\nsays: \"His blank verses, those that can read them may probably find to be\r\nlike the blank verses of his neighbors.\"  Shenstone encouraged Percy to\r\npublish his \"Reliques.\"  The plans for the grounds at Abbotsford were\r\nsomewhat influenced by Didsley's description of the Leasowes, which Scott\r\nstudied with great interest.\r\n\r\nIn 1744 Mark Akenside, a north country man and educated partly in\r\nScotland, published his \"Pleasures of Imagination,\" afterwards rewritten\r\nas \"The Pleasures of the Imagination\" and spoiled in the process.  The\r\ntitle and something of the course of thought in the poem were taken from\r\nAddison's series of papers on the subject (_Spectator_, Nos. 411-421).\r\nAkenside was a man of learning and a physician of distinction.  His poem,\r\nprinted when he was only twenty-three, enjoyed a popularity now rather\r\nhard to account for.  Gray complained of its obscurity and said it was\r\nissued nine years too early, but admitted that now and then it rose \"even\r\nto the best, particularly in description.\"  Akenside was harsh, formal,\r\nand dogmatic, as a man.  Smollett caricatured him in \"Peregrine Pickle.\"\r\nJohnson hated his Whig principles and represents him, when settled at\r\nNorthampton, as \"having deafened the place with clamors for liberty.\"[47]\r\nHe furthermore disliked the class of poetry to which Akenside's work\r\nbelonged, and he told Boswell that he couldn't read it.  Still he speaks\r\nof him with a certain cautious respect, which seems rather a concession\r\nto contemporary opinion than an appreciation of the critic's own.  He\r\neven acknowledges that Akenside has \"few artifices of disgust than most\r\nof his brethren of the blank song.\"  Lowell says that the very title of\r\nAkenside's poem pointed \"away from the level highway of commonplace to\r\nmountain paths and less dogmatic prospects.  The poem was stiff and\r\nunwilling, but in its loins lay the seed of nobler births.  Without it,\r\nthe 'Lines Written at Tintern Abbey' might never have been.\"\r\n\r\nOne cannot read \"The Pleasures of Imagination\" without becoming sensible\r\nthat the writer was possessed of poetic feeling, and feeling of a kind\r\nthat we generally agree to call romantic.  His doctrine at least, if not\r\nhis practice, was in harmony with the fresh impulse which was coming into\r\nEnglish poetry.  Thus he celebrates heaven-born genius and the\r\ninspiration of nature, and decries \"the critic-verse\" and the effort to\r\nscale Parnassus \"by dull obedience.\"  He invokes the peculiar muse of the\r\nnew school:\r\n\r\n    \"Indulgent _Fancy_, from the fruitful banks\r\n    Of Avon, whence thy rosy fingers cull\r\n    Fresh flowers and dews to sprinkle on the turf\r\n    Where Shakspere lies.\"\r\n\r\nBut Akenside is too abstract.  In place of images, he presents the reader\r\nwith dissertations.  A poem which takes imagination as its subject rather\r\nthan its method will inevitably remain, not poetry but a lecture on\r\npoetry--a theory of beauty, not an example of it.  Akenside might have\r\nchosen for his motto Milton's lines:\r\n\r\n        \"How charming is divine philosophy!\r\n    Not harsh and crabbëd, as dull fools suppose,\r\n    But musical as is Apollo's lute.\"\r\n\r\nYet he might have remembered, too, what Milton said about the duty of\r\npoetry to be simple, sensuous, and passionate.  Akenside's is nothing of\r\nthese; it is, on the contrary obscure, metaphysical, and, as a\r\nconsequence, frigid.  Following Addison, he names greatness and novelty,\r\n_i.e._, the sublime and the wonderful, as, equally with beauty, the chief\r\nsources of imaginative pleasure, and the whole poem is a plea for what we\r\nare now accustomed to call the ideal.  In the first book there is a\r\npassage which is fine in spirit and--though in a less degree--in\r\nexpression:\r\n\r\n    \"Who that from Alpine heights his laboring eye\r\n    Shoots round the wide horizon, to survey\r\n    Nilus or Ganges rolling his bright wave\r\n    Through mountains, plains, through empires black with shade.\r\n    And continents of sand, will turn his gaze\r\n    To mark the windings of a scanty rill\r\n    That murmurs at his feet?  The high-born soul\r\n    Disdains to rest her heaven-aspiring wing\r\n    Beneath its native quarry.  Tired of earth\r\n    And this diurnal scene, she springs aloft\r\n    Through fields of air; pursues the flying storm;\r\n    Rides on the vollied lightning through the heavens;\r\n    Or, yoked with whirlwinds and the northern blast,\r\n    Sweeps the long trace of day.\"\r\n\r\nThe hint for this passage was furnished by a paragraph in Addison's\r\nsecond paper (_Spectator_, 412) and the emotion is the same to which\r\nGoethe gives utterance in the well-known lines of \"Faust\";\r\n\r\n    \"Doch jedem ist es eingeboren\r\n    Dass sein Gefühl hinauf und vorwärts dringt,\" etc.\r\n\r\nBut how greatly superior in sharpness of detail, richness of invention,\r\nenergy of movement is the German to the English poet!\r\n\r\nAkenside ranks among the earlier Spenserians by virtue of his \"Virtuoso\"\r\n(1737) and of several odes composed in a ten-lined variation on Spenser's\r\nstanza.  A collection of his \"Odes\" appeared in 1745--the year before\r\nCollins' and Joseph Warton's-and a second in 1760.  They are of little\r\nvalue, but show here and there traces of Milton's minor poetry and that\r\nelegiac sentiment, common to the lyrical verse of the time, noticeable\r\nparticularly in a passage on the nightingale in Ode XV, book i;, \"To the\r\nEvening Star.\"  \"The Pleasures of Imagination\" was the parent of a\r\nnumerous offspring of similarly entitled pieces, among which are Joseph\r\nWarton's \"Pleasures of Melancholy,\" Campbell's \"Pleasures of Hope,\" and\r\nRogers' \"Pleasures of Memory.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year with Thomson's \"Winter\" (1726) there were published in\r\ntwo poetical miscellanies a pair of little descriptive pieces, \"Grongar\r\nHill\" and \"The Country Walk,\" written by John Dyer, a young Welshman, in\r\nthe octosyllabic couplet of Milton's \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Pensoroso.\"\r\n(\"Grongar Hill,\" as first printed was a sort of irregular ode with\r\nalternate rhyming; but it was much improvised in later editions, and\r\nrewritten throughout in couplets.)\r\n\r\nDyer was a landscape painter who had been educated at Westminster school,\r\nstudied under Richardson at London, and spent some time wandering about\r\nthe mountains of Wales in the practice of his art.  \"Grongar Hill\" is, in\r\nfact, a pictorial poem, a sketch of the landscape seen from the top of\r\nhis favorite summit in South Wales.  It is a slight piece of work,\r\ncareless and even slovenly in execution, but with an ease and lightness\r\nof touch that contrast pleasantly with Thomson's and Akenside's\r\nponderosity.  When Dyer wrote blank verse he slipped into the Thomsonian\r\ndiction, \"cumbent sheep\" and \"purple groves pomaceous.\"  But in \"Grongar\r\nHill\"--although he does call the sun Phoebus--the shorter measure seems\r\nto bring shorter words, and he has lines of Wordsworthian simplicity--\r\n\r\n    \"The woody valleys warm and low,\r\n    The windy summit, wild and high.\"\r\n\r\nor the closing passage, which Wordsworth alludes to in his sonnet on\r\nDyer--\"Long as the thrush shall pipe on Grongar Hill\":\r\n\r\n    \"Grass and flowers Quiet treads\r\n    On the meads and mountain heads. . .\r\n    And often, by the murmuring rill,\r\n    Hears the thrush while all is still,\r\n    Within the groves of Grongar Hill.\"\r\n\r\nWordsworth was attracted by Dyer's love of \"mountain turf\" and \"spacious\r\nairy downs\" and \"naked Snowdon's wide, aerial waste.\"  The \"power of\r\nhills\" was on him.  Like Wordsworth, too, he moralized his song.  In\r\n\"Grongar Hill,\" the ruined tower suggests the transience of human life:\r\nthe rivers running down to the sea are likened to man's career from birth\r\nto death; and Campbell's couplet,\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view\r\n    And robes the mountain in its azure hue,\"[48]\r\n\r\nis thought to owe something to Dyer's\r\n\r\n    \"As yon summits soft and fair,\r\n    Clad in colors of the air\r\n    Which to those who journey near\r\n    Barren, brown and rough appear,\r\n    Still we tread the same coarse way,\r\n    The present's still a cloudy day.\"\r\n\r\nDyer went to Rome to pursue his art studies and, on his return in 1740,\r\npublished his \"Ruins of Rome\" in blank verse.  He was not very successful\r\nas a painter, and finally took orders, married, and settled down as a\r\ncountry parson.  In 1757 he published his most ambitious work, \"The\r\nFleece,\" a poem in blank verse and in four books, descriptive of English\r\nwool-growing.  \"The subject of 'The Fleece,' sir,\" pronounced Johnson,\r\n\"cannot be made poetical.  How can a man write poetically of serges and\r\ndruggets?\"  Didactic poetry, in truth, leads too often to ludicrous\r\ndescents.  Such precepts as \"beware the rot,\" \"enclose, enclose, ye\r\nswains,\" and\r\n\r\n                \"-the utility of salt\r\n    Teach thy slow swains\";\r\n\r\nwith prescriptions for the scab, and advice as to divers kinds of wool\r\ncombs, are fatal.  A poem of this class has to be _made_ poetical, by\r\ndragging in episodes and digressions which do not inhere in the subject\r\nitself but are artificially associated with it.  Of such a nature is the\r\nloving mention--quoted in Wordsworth's sonnet--of the poet's native\r\nCarmarthenshire\r\n\r\n                \"-that soft tract\r\n    Of Cambria, deep embayed, Dimetian land,\r\n    By green hills fenced, by Ocean's murmur lulled.\"\r\n\r\nLowell admired the line about the Siberian exiles, met\r\n\r\n    \"On the dark level of adversity.\"\r\n\r\nMiltonic reminiscences are frequent in Dyer.  Sabrina is borrowed from\r\n\"Comus\"; \"bosky bourn\" and \"soothest shepherd\" from the same; \"the light\r\nfantastic toe\" from \"L'Allegro\"; \"level brine\" and \"nor taint-worm shall\r\ninfect the yearning herds,\" from \"Lycidas\"; \"audience pure be thy\r\ndelight, though few,\" from \"Paradise Lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dyer,\" wrote Gray to Horace Walpole in 1751, \"has more of poetry in\r\nhis imagination than almost any of our number; but rough and\r\ninjudicious.\"  Akenside, who helped Dyer polish the manuscript of \"The\r\nFleece,\" said that \"he would regulate his opinion of the reigning taste\r\nby the fate of Dyer's 'Fleece'; for if that were ill received, he should\r\nnot think it any longer reasonable to expect fame from excellence.\"  The\r\nromantic element in Dyer's imagination appears principally in his love of\r\nthe mountains and of ancient ruins.  Johnson cites with approval a\r\nsentence in \"The Ruins of Rome\":\r\n\r\n                    \"At dead of night,\r\n    The hermit oft, midst his orisons, hears\r\n    Aghast the voice of Time disparting towers.\"[49]\r\n\r\nThese were classic ruins.  Perhaps the doctor's sympathy would not have\r\nbeen so quickly extended to the picture of the moldering Gothic tower in\r\n\"Grongar Hill,\" or of \"solitary Stonehenge gray with moss,\" in \"The\r\nFleece.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] W.

The extremely artificial French taste had long taken the\r\nlead in civilized Europe, and now there was an attempt to shake off the\r\nshackles of its exaggerated formalism.  The poets of the age were also\r\npioneers of this school of nature.  Dyer, in his poem of 'Grongar Hill,'\r\nand Thomson, in his 'Seasons,' called up pictures which the gardeners and\r\narchitects of the day strove to imitate.\"  See in this work, for good\r\nexamples of the formal garden, the plan of Belton House, Lincoln, p. 245;\r\nof Brome Hall, Suffolk; of the orangery and canal at Euston, p. 201; and\r\nthe scroll work patterns of turf and parterres on pp. 217-18.\r\n\r\n[30] In Temple's gardens at Moor Park, Hertfordshire, _e.g._, there were\r\nterraces covered with lead.  Charles II. imported some of Le Notre's\r\npupils and assistants, who laid out the grounds at Hampton Court in the\r\nFrench taste.  The maze at Hampton Court still existed in Walpole's time\r\n(1770).\r\n\r\n[31] It is worth noticing that Batty Langley, the abortive restorer of\r\nGothic, also recommended the natural style of landscape gardening as\r\nearly as 1728 in his \"New Principles of Gardening.\"\r\n\r\n[32] \"History of Gardening in England.\"\r\n\r\n[33] I. 384-404.\r\n\r\n[34] \"The Works of William Mason,\" in 4 vols., London, 1811.\r\n\r\n[35] See Pope's paper in the _Guardian_ (173) for some rather elaborate\r\nfoolery about topiary work.  \"All art,\" he maintains, \"consists in the\r\nimitation and study of nature.\"  \"We seem to make it our study to recede\r\nfrom nature, not only in the various tonsure of greens into the most\r\nregular and formal shapes, but,\" etc., etc.  Addison, too, _Spectator_\r\n414, June 25, 1712, upholds \"the rough, careless strokes of nature\"\r\nagainst \"the nice touches and embellishments of art,\" and complains that\r\n\"our British gardeners, instead of humoring nature, love to deviate from\r\nit as much as possible.  Our trees rise in cones, globes, and pyramids.\r\nWe see the marks of the scissors upon every plant and bush.

It is another example of that curiously topsy-turvy\r\ncondition of things in which rhyme was a mark of the classic, and blank\r\nverse of the romantic.  For Milton is the most truly classical of English\r\npoets; and yet, from the angle of observation at which the eighteenth\r\ncentury viewed him, he appeared a romantic.  It was upon his romantic\r\nside, at all events, that the new school of poets apprehended and\r\nappropriated him.\r\n\r\nThis side was present in Milton in a fuller measure than his completed\r\nworks would show.  It is well known that he, at one time, had projected\r\nan Arthuriad, a design which, if carried out, might have anticipated\r\nTennyson and so deprived us of \"The Idyls of the King.\"  \"I betook me,\"\r\nhe writes, \"among those lofty fables and romances which recount in solemn\r\ncantos the deeds of knighthood.\"[1]  And in the \"Epitaphium Damonis\" he\r\nthus apprised the reader of his purpose:\r\n\r\n    \"Ipse ego Dardanais Rutupina per aequora puppes,\r\n    Dicam, et Pandrasidos regnum vetus Inogeniae,\r\n    Brennumque Arviragunque duces, priscumque Belinum,\r\n    Et tandem Armoricos Britonum sub lege colonos;\r\n    Tum gravidam Arturo fatali fraude Iörgernen;\r\n    Mendaces vultus, assumptaque Gorlöis arma,\r\n    Merlini dolus.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe \"matter of Britain\" never quite lost the fascination which it had\r\nexercised over his youthful imagination, as appears from passages in\r\n\"Paradise Lost\"[3] and even in \"Paradise Regained.\"[4]  But with his\r\nincreasing austerity, both religious and literary, Milton gravitated\r\nfinally to Hebraic themes and Hellenic art forms.  He wrote Homeric epics\r\nand Aeschylean tragedies, instead of masques and sonnets, of rhymed\r\npieces on the Italian model, like \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso,\" and of\r\nstanzaic poems, like the \"Nativity Ode,\" touched with Elizabethan\r\nconceits.  He relied more and more upon sheer construction and weight of\r\nthought and less upon decorative richness of detail.  His diction became\r\nnaked and severe, and he employed rhyme but sparingly, even in the choral\r\nparts of \"Samson Agonistes.\"  In short, like Goethe, he grew classical as\r\nhe grew old.  It has been mentioned that \"Paradise Lost\" did much to keep\r\nalive the tradition of English blank verse through a period remarkable\r\nfor its bigoted devotion to rhyme, and especially to the heroic couplet.\r\nYet it was, after all, Milton's early poetry, in which rhyme is\r\nused--though used so differently from the way in which Pope used it--that\r\ncounted for most in the history of the romantic movement.  Professor\r\nMasson contradicts the common assertion, that \"Paradise Lost\" was first\r\nwritten into popularity by Addison's Saturday papers.  While that series\r\nwas running, Tonson brought out (1711-13) an ediction of Milton's\r\npoetical works which was \"the ninth of 'Paradise Lost,' the eight of\r\n'Paradise Regained,' the seventh of 'Samson Agonistes' and the sixth of\r\nthe minor poems.\"  The previous issues of the minor poems had been in\r\n1645, 1673, 1695, 1705, and 1707.  Six editions in sixty-eight years is\r\ncertainly no very great showing.  After 1713 editions of Milton\r\nmultiplied rapidly; by 1763 \"Paradise Lost\" was in its forty-sixth, and\r\nthe minor poems in their thirtieth.[5]\r\n\r\nAddison selected an occasional passage from Milton's juvenile poems, in\r\nthe _Spectator_; but from all obtainable evidence, it seems not doubtful\r\nthat they had been comparatively neglected, and that, although reissued\r\nfrom time to time in complete editions of Milton's poetry, they were\r\nregarded merely as pendents to \"Paradise Lost\" and floated by its\r\nreputation.  \"Whatever causes,\" says Dryden, \"Milton alleges for the\r\nabolishing of rime . . . his own particular reason is plainly this, that\r\nrime was not his talent: he had neither the ease of doing it, nor the\r\ngraces of it: which is manifest in his 'Juvenilia' or verses written in\r\nhis youth; where his rime is always constrained and forced and comes\r\nhardly from him.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Warton, writing in 1756,[6] after quoting copiously from the\r\n\"Nativity Ode,\" which, he says, is \"not sufficiently read nor admired,\"\r\ncontinues as follows: \"I have dwelt chiefly on this ode as much less\r\ncelebrated than 'L'Allegro' and \"Il Penseroso,\"[7] which are now\r\nuniversally known,; but which, by a strange fatality, lay in a sort of\r\nobscurity, the private enjoyment of a few curious readers, till they were\r\nset to admirable music by Mr. Handel.  And indeed this volume of Milton's\r\nmiscellaneous poems has not till very lately met with suitable regard.\r\nShall I offend any rational admirer of Pope, by remarking that these\r\njuvenile descriptive poems of Milton, as well as his Latin elegies, are\r\nof a strain far more exalted than any the former author can boast?\"\r\n\r\nThe first critical edition of the minor poems was published in 1785, by\r\nThomas Warton, whose annotations have been of great service to all later\r\neditors.  As late as 1779, Dr. Johnson spoke of these same poems with an\r\nabsence of appreciation that now seems utterly astounding.  \"Those who\r\nadmire the beauties of this great poem sometimes force their own judgment\r\ninto false admiration of his little pieces, and prevail upon themselves\r\nto think that admirable which is only singular.\"  Of Lycidas he says: \"In\r\nthis poem there is no nature, for there is no truth; there is no art, for\r\nthere is nothing new.  Its form is that of a pastoral, easy, vulgar, and\r\ntherefore disgusting. . .  Surely no man could have fancied that he read\r\n'Lycidas' with pleasure, had he not known its author.\"  He acknowledges\r\nthat \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso\" are \"noble efforts of imagination\";\r\nand that, \"as a series of lines,\" \"Comus\" \"may be considered as worthy of\r\nall the admiration with which the votaries have received it.\"  But he\r\nmakes peevish objections to its dramatic probability, finds its dialogues\r\nand soliloquies tedious, and unmindful of the fate of Midas, solemnly\r\npronounces the songs--\"Sweet Echo\" and \"Sabrina fair\"--\"harsh in their\r\ndiction and not very musical in their numbers\"!  Of the sonnets he says:\r\n\"They deserve not any particular criticism; for of the best it can only\r\nbe said that they are not bad.\"[8]  Boswell reports that, Hannah More\r\nhaving expressed her \"wonder that the poet who had written 'Paradise\r\nLost' should write such poor sonnets,\" Johnson replied:  \"Milton, madam,\r\nwas a genius that could cut a colossus from a rock, but could not carve\r\nheads upon cherry stones.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of Milton's minor poetry first becomes noticeable in the\r\nfifth decade of the century, and in the work of a new group of lyrical\r\npoets: Collins, Gray, Mason, and the brothers Joseph and Thomas Warton.\r\nTo all of these Milton was master.  But just as Thomson and Shenstone got\r\noriginal effects from Spenser's stanza, while West and Cambridge and\r\nLloyd were nothing but echoes; so Collins and Gray--immortal names--drew\r\nfresh music from Milton's organ pipes, while for the others he set the\r\ntune.  The Wartons, indeed, though imitative always in their verse, have\r\nan independent and not inconsiderable position in criticism and literary\r\nscholarship, and I shall return to them later in that connection.  Mason,\r\nwhose \"English Garden\" has been reviewed in chapter iv, was a small poet\r\nand a somewhat absurd person.  He aped, first Milton and afterward Gray,\r\nso closely that his work often seems like parody.  In general the\r\nMiltonic revival made itself manifest in a more dispersed and indirect\r\nfashion than the Spenserian; but there was no lack of formal imitations,\r\nalso, and it will be advisable to notice a few of these here in the order\r\nof their dates.\r\n\r\nIn 1740 Joseph Warton, then an Oxford undergraduate, wrote his\r\nblank-verse poem \"The Enthusiast, or the Lover of Nature.\"  The work of a\r\nboy of eighteen, it had that instinct of the future, of the set of the\r\nliterary current, not uncommon in youthful artists, of which Chatterton's\r\nprecocious verses are a remarkable instance.  Composed only ten years\r\nlater than the completed \"Seasons,\" and five years before Shenstone began\r\nto lay out his miniature wilderness at the Leasowes, it is more\r\ndistinctly modern and romantic in its preference of wild nature to\r\ncultivated landscape, and of the literature of fancy to the literature of\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n    \"What are the lays of artful Addison,\r\n    Coldly correct, to Shakspere's warblings wild?\"\r\n\r\nasks the young enthusiast, in Milton's own phrase.  And again\r\n\r\n    \"Can Kent design like Nature?. . .\r\n    Though he, by rules unfettered, boldly scorns\r\n    Formality and method, round and square\r\n    Disdaining, plans irregularly great?. . .\r\n\r\n                \"Versailles\r\n    May boast a thousand fountains that can cast\r\n    The tortured waters to the distant heavens;\r\n    Yet let me choose some pine-topped precipice\r\n    Abrupt and shaggy, whence a foamy stream,\r\n    Like Anio, tumbling roars; or some black heath\r\n    Where straggling stands the mournful juniper,\r\n    Or yew tree scathed.\"\r\n\r\nThe enthusiast haunts \"dark forests\" and loves to listen to \"hollow winds\r\nand ever-beating waves\" and \"sea-mew's clang.\"  Milton appears at every\r\nturn, not only in single epithets like \"Lydian airs,\" \"the level brine,\"\r\n\"low-thoughted cares,\" \"the light fantastic dance,\" but in the entire\r\nspirit, imagery, and diction of the poem.  A few lines illustrate this\r\nbetter than any description.\r\n\r\n    \"Ye green-robed Dryads, oft at dusky eve\r\n    By wondering shepherds seen; to forest brown,\r\n    To unfrequented meads and pathless wilds\r\n    Lead me from gardens decked with art's vain pomp. . .\r\n    But let me never fall in cloudless night,\r\n    When silent Cynthia in her silver car\r\n    Through the blue concave slides,. . .\r\n    To seek some level mead, and there invoke\r\n    Old midnight's sister, contemplation sage\r\n    (Queen of the rugged brow and stern-fixed eye),\r\n    To lift my soul above this little earth,\r\n    This folly-fettered world: to purge my ears,\r\n    That I may hear the rolling planet's song\r\n    And tuneful turning spheres.\"\r\n\r\nMason's Miltonic imitations, \"Musaeus,\" \"Il Bellicoso\" and \"Il Pacifico\"\r\nwere written in 1744--according to the statement of their author, whose\r\nstatements, however, are not always to be relied upon.  The first was\r\npublished in 1747; the second \"surreptitiously printed in a magazine and\r\nafterward inserted in Pearch's miscellany,\" finally revised and published\r\nby the author in 1797; the third first printed in 1748 in the Cambridge\r\nverses on the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle.  These pieces follow copy in\r\nevery particular.  \"Il Bellicoso,\" _e.g._, opens with the invocation.\r\n\r\n    \"Hence, dull lethargic Peace,\r\n    Born in some hoary beadsman's cell obscure!\"\r\n\r\nThe genealogies of Peace and War are recited, and contrasted pictures of\r\npeaceful and warlike pleasures presented in an order which corresponds as\r\nprecisely as possible to Milton's in \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Then, to unbend my mind, I'll roam\r\n    Amid the cloister's silent gloom;\r\n    Or, where ranged oaks their shades diffuse,\r\n    Hold dalliance with my darling Muse,\r\n    Recalling oft some heaven-born strain\r\n    That warbled in Augustan reign;\r\n    Or turn, well pleased, the Grecian page,\r\n    If sweet Theocritus engage,\r\n    Or blithe Anacreon, mirthful wight,\r\n    Carol his easy love-lay light. . .\r\n    And joys like these, if Peace inspire\r\n    Peace, with thee I string the lyre.\"[9]\r\n\r\n\"Musaeus\" was a monody on the death of Pope, employing the pastoral\r\nmachinery and the varied irregular measure of \"Lycidas.\"  Chaucer,\r\nSpenser, and Milton, under the names of Tityrus, Colin Clout, and\r\nThyrsis, are introduced as mourners, like Camus and St. Peter in the\r\noriginal.  Tityrus is made to lament the dead shepherd in very incorrect\r\nMiddle English.  Colin Clout speaks two stanzas of the form used in the\r\nfirst eclogue of \"The Shepherd's Calendar,\" and three stanzas of the form\r\nused in \"The Faërie Queene.\"  Thyrsis speaks in blank verse and is\r\nanswered by the shade of Musaeus (Pope) in heroic couplets.  Verbal\r\ntravesties of \"Lycidas\" abound--\"laureate hearse,\" \"forego each vain\r\nexcuse,\" \"without the loan of some poetic woe,\" etc.; and the closing\r\npassage is reworded thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Thus the fond swain his Doric oat essayed,\r\n    Manhood's prime honors rising on his cheek:\r\n    Trembling he strove to court the tuneful Maid,\r\n    With stripling arts and dalliance all too weak,\r\n    Unseen, unheard beneath an hawthorn shade.\r\n    But now dun clouds the welkin 'gan to streak;\r\n    And now down dropt the larks and ceased their strain:\r\n    They ceased, and with them ceased the shepherd swain.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1746 appeared a small volume of odes, fourteen in number, by Joseph\r\nWarton, and another by William Collins.[10]  The event is thus noticed by\r\nGray in a letter to Thomas Wharton: \"Have you seen the works of two young\r\nauthors, a Mr. Warton and a Mr. Collins, both writers of odes?  It is odd\r\nenough, but each is the half of a considerable man, and one the\r\ncounterpart of the other.  The first has but little invention, very\r\npoetical choice of expression and a good ear.  The second, a fine fancy,\r\nmodeled upon the antique, a bad ear, a great variety of words and images\r\nwith no choice at all.  They both deserve to last some years, but will\r\nnot.\"  Gray's critical acuteness is not altogether at fault in this\r\njudgment, but half of his prophecy has failed, and his mention of Collins\r\nis singularly inappreciative.  The names of Collins and Gray are now\r\nclosely associated in literary history, but in life the two men were in\r\nno way connected.  Collins and the Wartons, on the other hand, were\r\npersonal friends.  Joseph Warton and Collins had been schoolfellows at\r\nWinchester, and it was at first intended that their odes, which were\r\nissued in the same month (December), should be published in a volume\r\ntogether.  Warton's collection was immediately successful; but Collins'\r\nwas a failure, and the author, in his disappointment, burned the unsold\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\nThe odes of Warton which most nearly resemble Milton are \"To Fancy,\" \"To\r\nSolitude,\" and \"To the Nightingale,\" all in the eight-syllabled couplet.\r\nA single passage will serve as a specimen of their quality:\r\n\r\n    \"Me, Goddess, by the right hand lead\r\n    Sometimes through the yellow mead,\r\n    Where Joy and white-robed Peace resort\r\n    And Venus keeps her festive court:\r\n    Where Mirth and Youth each evening meet,\r\n    And lightly trip with nimble feet,\r\n    Nodding their lily-crowned heads;\r\n    Where Laughter rose-lip'd Hebe leads,\" etc.[11]\r\n\r\nCollins' \"Ode to Simplicity\" is in the stanza of the \"Nativity Ode,\" and\r\nhis beautiful \"Ode to Evening,\" in the unrhymed Sapphics which Milton had\r\nemployed in his translation of Horace's \"Ode to Pyrrha.\"  There are\r\nMiltonic reminiscences like \"folding-star,\" \"religious gleams,\" \"play\r\nwith the tangles of her hair,\" and in the closing couplet of the \"Ode to\r\nFear,\"\r\n\r\n    \"His cypress wreath my meed decree,\r\n    And I, O Fear, will dwell with thee.\"\r\n\r\nBut, in general, Collins is much less slavish than Warton in his\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\nJoseph Warton's younger brother, Thomas, wrote in 1745, and published in\r\n1747, \"The Pleasures of Melancholy,\" a blank-verse poem of three hundred\r\nand fifteen lines, made up, in nearly equal parts, of Milton and\r\nAkenside, with frequent touches of Thomson, Spenser, and Pope's \"Epistle\r\nof Eloisa to Abelard.\"  Warton was a lad of seventeen when his poem was\r\nwritten: it was published anonymously and was by some attributed to\r\nAkenside, whose \"Pleasures of Imagination\" (1744) had, of course,\r\nsuggested the title.  A single extract will suffice to show how well the\r\nyoung poet knew his Milton:\r\n\r\n    \"O lead me, queen sublime, to solemn glooms\r\n    Congenial with my soul; to cheerless shades,\r\n    To ruined seats, to twilight cells and bowers,\r\n    Where thoughtful Melancholy loves to muse,\r\n    Her favorite midnight haunts. . .\r\n    Beneath yon ruined abbey's moss-grown piles\r\n    Oft let me sit, at twilight hour of eve,\r\n    When through some western window the pale moon\r\n    _Pours her long-levelled rule streaming light:_\r\n    While sullen sacred silence reigns around,\r\n    Save the lone screech-owl's note, who build his bower\r\n    Amid the moldering caverns dark and damp;[12]\r\n    Or the calm breeze, that rustles in the leaves\r\n    Of flaunting ivy, that with mantle green\r\n    Invests some wasted tower. . .\r\n    Then when the sullen shades of evening close\r\n    Where _through the room_ a blindly-glimmering gloom\r\n    The _dying embers_ scatter, far remote\r\n    From Mirth's mad shouts, that through the illumined roof\r\n    Resound with festive echo, let me sit\r\n    Blessed with the lowly cricket's drowsy dirge. . .\r\n    This sober hour of silence will unmask\r\n    False Folly's smile, that like the dazzling spells\r\n    Of wily Comus cheat the unweeting eye\r\n    With _blear illusion,_ and persuade to drink\r\n    That charmëd cup which _Reason's mintage fair_\r\n_    Unmoulds_, and stamps the monster on the man.\"\r\n\r\nI italicize the most direct borrowings, but both the Wartons had so\r\nsaturated themselves with Milton's language, verse, and imagery that they\r\nooze out of them at every pore.  Thomas Warton's poems, issued separately\r\nfrom time to time, were first published collectively in 1777.  They are\r\nall imitative, and most of them imitative of Milton.  His two best odes,\r\n\"On the First of April\" and \"On the Approach of Summer,\" are in the\r\nfamiliar octosyllabics.\r\n\r\n    \"Haste thee, Nymph! and hand in hand,\r\n    With thee lead a buxom band;\r\n    Bring fantastic-footed joy,\r\n    With Sport, that yellow-tressëd boy,\" etc.[13]\r\n\r\nIn Gray and Collins, though one can hardly read a page without being\r\nreminded of Milton, it is commonly in subtler ways than this.  Gray, for\r\nexample, has been careful to point out in his notes his verbal\r\nobligations to Milton, as well as to Shakspere, Cowley, Dryden, Pindar,\r\nVergil, Dante, and others; but what he could not well point out, because\r\nit was probably unconscious, was the impulse which Milton frequently gave\r\nto the whole exercise of his imagination.  It is not often that Gray\r\ntreads so closely in Milton's footsteps as he does in the latest of his\r\npoems, the ode written for music, and performed at Cambridge in 1769 on\r\nthe installation of the Duke of Grafton as Chancellor; in which Milton is\r\nmade to sing a stanza in the meter of the \"Nativity Ode\";\r\n\r\n      \"Ye brown o'er-arching groves\r\n      That Contemplation loves,\r\n    Where willowy Camus lingers with delight;\r\n      Oft at the blush of dawn\r\n      I trod your level lawn,\r\n    Oft wooed the gleam of Cynthia, silver bright,\r\n    In cloisters dim, far from the haunts of Folly,\r\n    With Freedom by my side, and soft-eyed Melancholy.\"\r\n\r\nNot only the poets who have been named, but many obscure versifiers are\r\nwitnesses to this Miltonic revival.  It is usually, indeed, the minor\r\npoetry of an age which keeps most distinctly the \"cicatrice and capable\r\nimpressure\" of a passing literary fashion.  If we look through Dodsley's\r\ncollection,[14] we find a _mélange_ of satires in the manner of Pope,\r\nhumorous fables in the manner of Prior, didactic blank-verse pieces after\r\nthe fashion of Thomson and Akenside, elegiac quatrains on the model of\r\nShenstone and Gray, Pindaric odes _ad nauseam_, with imitations of\r\nSpenser and Milton.[15]\r\n\r\nTo the increasing popularity of Milton's minor poetry is due the revival\r\nof the sonnet.  Gray's solitary sonnet, on the death of his friend\r\nRichard West, was composed in 1742 but not printed till 1775, after the\r\nauthor's death.  This was the sonnet selected by Wordsworth, to\r\nillustrate his strictures on the spurious poetic diction of the\r\neighteenth century, in the appendix to the preface to the second edition\r\nof \"Lyrical Ballads.\"  The style is noble, though somewhat artificial:\r\nthe order of the rhymes conforms neither to the Shaksperian nor the\r\nMiltonic model.  Mason wrote fourteen sonnets at various times between\r\n1748 and 1797; the earlier date is attached, in his collected works, to\r\n\"Sonnet I. Sent to a Young Lady with Dodsley's Miscellanies.\"  They are\r\nof the strict Italian or Miltonic form, and abound in Miltonic allusions\r\nand wordings.  All but four of Thomas Edwards' fifty sonnets, 1750-65,\r\nare on Milton's model. Thirteen of them were printed in Dodsley's second\r\nvolume.  They have little value, nor have those of Benjamin\r\nStillingfleet, some of which appear to have been written before 1750.  Of\r\nmuch greater interest are the sonnets of Thomas Warton, nine in number\r\nand all Miltonic in form.  Warton's collected poems were not published\r\ntill 1777, and his sonnets are undated, but some of them seem to have\r\nbeen written as early as 1750.  They are graceful in expression and\r\nreflect their author's antiquarian tastes.  They were praised by Hazlitt,\r\nColeridge, and Lamb; and one of them, \"To the River Lodon,\" has been\r\nthought to have suggested Coleridge's \"To the River Otter--\"\r\n\r\n    \"Dear native stream, wild streamlet of the west--\"\r\n\r\nas well, perhaps, more remotely Wordsworth's series, \"On the River\r\nDuddon.\"\r\n\r\nThe poem of Milton which made the deepest impression upon the new school\r\nof poets was \"Il Penseroso.\"  This little masterpiece, which sums up in\r\nimagery of \"Attic choice\" the pleasures that Burton and Fletcher and many\r\nothers had found in the indulgence of the atrabilious humor, fell in with\r\na current of tendency.  Pope had died in 1744, Swift in 1745, the last\r\nimportant survivors of the Queen Anne wits; and already the reaction\r\nagainst gayety had set in, in the deliberate and exaggerated solemnity\r\nwhich took possession of all departments of verse, and even invaded the\r\ntheater; where Melpomene gradually crowded Thalia off the boards, until\r\nsentimental comedy--_la comedie larmoyante_--was in turn expelled by the\r\nridicule of Garrick, Goldsmith, and Sheridan.  That elegiac mood, that\r\nlove of retirement and seclusion, which have been remarked in Shenstone,\r\nbecame now the dominant note in English poetry.  The imaginative\r\nliterature of the years 1740-60 was largely the literature of low\r\nspirits.  The generation was persuaded, with Fletcher, that\r\n\r\n    \"Nothing's so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy.\"\r\n\r\nBut the muse of their inspiration was not the tragic Titaness of Dürer's\r\npainting:\r\n\r\n    \"The Melencolia that transcends all wit.\"[16]\r\n\r\nrather the \"mild Miltonic maid,\" Pensive Meditation.\r\n\r\nThere were various shades of somberness, from the delicate gray of the\r\nWartons to the funereal sable to Young's \"Night Thoughts\" (1742-44) and\r\nBlair's \"Grave\" (1743).  Goss speaks of Young as a \"connecting link\r\nbetween this group of poets and their predecessors of the Augustan age.\"\r\nHis poem does, indeed, exhibit much of the wit, rhetorical glitter, and\r\nstraining after point familiar in Queen Anne verse, in strange\r\ncombination with a \"rich note of romantic despair.\"[17]  Mr. Perry, too,\r\ndescribes Young's language as \"adorned with much of the crude ore of\r\nromanticism. . .  At this period the properties of the poet were but few:\r\nthe tomb, an occasional raven or screech-owl, and the pale moon, with\r\nskeletons and grinning ghosts. . .  One thing that the poets were never\r\ntired of, was the tomb. . .  It was the dramatic--can one say the\r\nmelodramatic?--view of the grave, as an inspirer of pleasing gloom, that\r\nwas preparing readers for the romantic outbreak.\"[18]\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, in Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\"\r\n(1751), that this elegiac feeling found its most perfect expression.\r\nCollins, too has \"more hearse-like airs than carols,\" and two of his most\r\nheartfelt lyrics are the \"Dirge in Cymbeline\" and the \"Ode on the Death\r\nof Mr. Thomson.\"  And the Wartons were perpetually recommending such\r\nthemes, both by precept and example.[19]  Blair and Young, however, are\r\nscarcely to be reckoned among the romanticists.  They were heavy\r\ndidactic-moral poets, for the most part, though they touched the string\r\nwhich, in the Gothic imagination, vibrates with a musical shiver to the\r\nthought of death.  There is something that accords with the spirit of\r\nGothic ecclesiastical architecture, with Gray's \"ivy-mantled tower\"--his\r\n\"long-drawn aisle and fretted vault\"--in the paraphernalia of the tomb\r\nwhich they accumulate so laboriously; the cypress and the yew, the owl\r\nand the midnight bell, the dust of the charnel-house, the nettles that\r\nfringe the grave-stones, the dim sepulchral lamp and gliding specters.\r\n\r\n    \"The wind is up.  Hark! how it howls!  Methinks\r\n    Till now I never heard a sound so dreary,\r\n    Doors creak and windows clap, and night's foul bird,\r\n    Rocked in the spire, screams loud: the gloomy aisles,\r\n    Black-plastered and hung 'round with shreds of scutcheons\r\n    And tattered coats-of-arms, send back the sound,\r\n    Laden with heavier airs, from the low vaults,\r\n    The mansions of the dead.\"[20]\r\n\r\nBlair's mortuary verse has a certain impressiveness, in its gloomy\r\nmonotony, not unlike that of Quarles' \"Divine Emblems.\"  Like the\r\n\"Emblems,\" too, \"The Grave,\" has been kept from oblivion by the art of\r\nthe illustrator, the well-known series of engravings by Schiavonetti from\r\ndesigns by Wm. Blake.\r\n\r\nBut the thoughtful scholarly fancy of the more purely romantic poets\r\nhaunted the dusk rather than the ebon blackness of midnight, and listened\r\nmore to the nightingale than to the screech-owl.  They were quietists,\r\nand their imagery was crepuscular.  They loved the twilight, with its\r\nbeetle and bat, solitude, shade, the \"darkening vale,\" the mossy\r\nhermitage, the ruined abbey moldering in its moonlit glade, grots,\r\ncaverns, brooksides, ivied nooks, firelight rooms, the curfew bell and\r\nthe sigh of the Aeolian harp.[21]  All this is exquisitely put in\r\nCollins' \"Ode to Evening.\"  Joseph Warton also wrote an \"Ode to Evening,\"\r\nas well as one \"To the Nightingale.\"  Both Wartons wrote odes \"To\r\nSolitude.\"  Dodsley's \"Miscellanies\" are full of odes to Evening,\r\nSolitude, Silence, Retirement, Contentment, Fancy, Melancholy, Innocence,\r\nSimplicity, Sleep; of Pleasures of Contemplation (Miss Whately, Vol. IX.\r\np. 120) Triumphs of Melancholy (James Beattie, Vol. X. p. 77), and\r\nsimilar matter.  Collins introduced a personified figure of Melancholy in\r\nhis ode, \"The Passions.\"\r\n\r\n    \"With eyes upraised, as one inspired,\r\n    Pale Melancholy sat retired;\r\n    And from her wild, sequestered seat,\r\n    In notes by distance made more sweet,\r\n    Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul;\r\n      And dashing soft from rocks around,\r\n      Bubbling runnels joined the sound;\r\n    Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole,\r\n      Or o'er some haunted stream, with fond delay,\r\n        Round a holy calm diffusing\r\n        Love of peace and lonely musing,\r\n      In hollow murmurs died away.\"\r\n\r\nCollins was himself afflicted with a melancholia which finally developed\r\ninto madness.  Gray, a shy, fastidious scholar, suffered from inherited\r\ngout and a lasting depression of spirits.  He passed his life as a\r\ncollege recluse in the cloistered retirement of Cambridge, residing at\r\none time in Pembroke, and at another in Peterhouse College.  He held the\r\nchair of modern history in the university, but never gave a lecture.  He\r\ndeclined the laureateship after Cibber's death.  He had great learning,\r\nand a taste most delicately correct; but the sources of creative impulse\r\ndried up in him more and more under the desiccating air of academic study\r\nand the increasing hold upon him of his constitutional malady.\r\n\"Melancholy marked him for her own.\"  There is a significant passage in\r\none of his early letters to Horace.  Walpole (1737): \"I have, at the\r\ndistance of half a mile, through a green lane, a forest (vulgar call it a\r\ncommon) all my own, at least as good as so, for I spy no human thing in\r\nit but myself.  It is a little chaos of mountains and precipices. . .\r\nBoth vale and hill are covered with most venerable beeches and other very\r\nreverend vegetables that, like most other ancient people, are always\r\ndreaming out their old stories to the winds. . .  At the foot of one of\r\nthese, squats ME, I, (il penseroso) and there grow to the trunk for a\r\nwhole morning.\"[22]  To Richard West he wrote, in the same year, \"Low\r\nspirits are my true and faithful companions\"; and, in 1742, \"Mine is a\r\nwhite Melancholy, or rather Leucocholy, for the most part . . . but there\r\nis another sort, black indeed, which I have now and then felt.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Gray sees the Eton schoolboys at their sports, he is sadly reminded:\r\n\r\n    \"--how all around them wait\r\n      The ministers of human fate\r\n    And black Misfortune's baleful train.\"[23]\r\n\r\n\"Wisdom in sable garb,\" and \"Melancholy, silent maid\" attend the\r\nfootsteps of Adversity;[24] and to Contemplation's sober eye, the race of\r\nman resembles the insect race:\r\n\r\n    \"Brushed by the hand of rough mischance,\r\n    Or chilled by age, their airy dance\r\n      They leave, in dust to rest.\"[25]\r\n\r\nWill it be thought too trifling an observation that the poets of this\r\ngroup were mostly bachelors and _quo ad hoc_, solitaries?  Thomson,\r\nAkenside, Shenstone, Collins, Gray, and Thomas Warton never married.\r\nDyer, Mason, and Joseph Warton, were beneficed clergymen, and took unto\r\nthemselves wives.  The Wartons, to be sure, were men of cheerful and even\r\nconvivial habits.  The melancholy which these good fellows affected was\r\nmanifestly a mere literary fashion.  They were sad \"only for wantonness,\"\r\nlike the young gentlemen in France.  \"And so you have a garden of your\r\nown,\" wrote Gray to his young friend Nicholls, in 1769, \"and you plant\r\nand transplant, and are dirty and amused; are you not ashamed of\r\nyourself?  Why, I have no such thing, you monster; nor ever shall be\r\neither dirty or amused as long as I live.\"  Gray never was; but the\r\nWartons were easily amused, and Thomas, by all accounts, not unfrequently\r\ndirty, or at least slovenly in his dress, and careless and unpolished in\r\nhis manners, and rather inclined to broad humor and low society.\r\n\r\nRomantically speaking, the work of these Miltonic lyrists marks an\r\nadvance upon that of the descriptive and elegiac poets, Thomson,\r\nAkenside, Dyer, and Shenstone.  Collins is among the choicest of English\r\nlyrical poets.  There is a flute-like music in his best odes--such as the\r\none \"To Evening,\" and the one written in 1746--\"How sleep the brave,\"\r\nwhich are sweeter, more natural, and more spontaneous than Gray's.  \"The\r\nMuse gave birth to Collins,\" says Swinburne; \"she did but give suck to\r\nGray.\"  Collins \"was a solitary song-bird among many more or less\r\nexcellent pipers and pianists.  He could put more spirit of color into a\r\nsingle stroke, more breath of music into a single note, than could all\r\nthe rest of the generation into all the labors of their lives.\"[26]\r\nCollins, like Gray, was a Greek scholar, and had projected a history of\r\nthe revival letters.  There is a classical quality in his verse--not\r\nclassical in the eighteenth-century sense--but truly Hellenic; a union,\r\nas in Keats, of Attic form with romantic sensibility; though in Collins,\r\nmore than in Keats, the warmth seems to comes from without; the statue of\r\na nymph flushed with sunrise.  \"Collins,\" says Gosse, \"has the touch of a\r\nsculptor; his verse is clearly cut and direct:  it is marble pure, but\r\nalso marble cold.\"[27]  Lowell, however, thinks that Collins \"was the\r\nfirst to bring back into poetry something of the antique flavor, and\r\nfound again the long-lost secret of being classically elegant without\r\nbeing pedantically cold.\"[28]\r\n\r\nThese estimates are given for what they are worth.  The coldness which is\r\nfelt--or fancied--in some of Collins' poetry comes partly from the\r\nabstractness of his subjects and the artificial style which he inherited,\r\nin common with all his generation.  Many of his odes are addressed to\r\nFear, Pity, Mercy, Liberty, and similar abstractions.  The\r\npseudo-Pindaric ode, is, in itself, an exotic; and, as an art form, is\r\nresponsible for some of the most tumid compositions in the history of\r\nEnglish verse.  Collins' most current ode, though by no means his best\r\none, \"The Passions,\" abounds in those personifications which, as has been\r\nsaid, constituted, in eighteenth century poetry, a sort of feeble\r\nmythology: \"wan Despair,\" \"dejected Pity,\" \"brown Exercise,\" and \"Music\r\nsphere-descended maid.\"  It was probably the allegorical figures in\r\nMilton's \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso,\" \"Sport that wrinkled care\r\nderides,\" \"spare Fast that oft with gods doth diet,\" etc., that gave a\r\nnew lease of life to this obsolescent machinery which the romanticists\r\nought to have abandoned to the Augustan schools.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of Collins' poems, from the point of view of these\r\ninquiries, is his \"Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands of\r\nScotland.\"  This was written in 1749, but as it remained in manuscript\r\ntill 1788, it was of course without influence on the minds of its\r\nauthor's contemporaries.  It had been left unfinished, and some of the\r\nprinted editions contained interpolated stanzas which have since been\r\nweeded away.  Inscribed to Mr. John Home, the author of \"Douglas,\" its\r\npurpose was to recommend to him the Scottish fairy lore as a fit subject\r\nfor poetry.  Collins justifies the selection of such \"false themes\" by\r\nthe example of Spenser, of Shakspere, (in \"Macbeth\"), and of Tasso\r\n\r\n            \"--whose undoubting mind\r\n    Believed the magic wonders which he sung.\"\r\n\r\nHe mentions, as instances of popular beliefs that have poetic\r\ncapabilities, the kelpie, the will-o'-the-wisp, and second sight.  He\r\nalludes to the ballad of \"Willie Drowned in Yarrow,\" and doubtless with a\r\nline of \"The Seasons\" running in his head,[29] conjures Home to \"forget\r\nnot Kilda's race,\" who live on the eggs of the solan goose, whose only\r\nprospect is the wintry main, and among whose cliffs the bee is never\r\nheard to murmur.  Perhaps the most imaginative stanza is the ninth,\r\nreferring to the Hebrides, the chapel of St. Flannan and the graves of\r\nthe Scottish, Irish, and Norwegian kings in Icolmkill:\r\n\r\n    \"Unbounded is thy range; with varied skill\r\n      Thy muse may, like those feathery tribes which spring\r\n      From their rude rocks, extend her skirting wing,\r\n    Round the moist marge of each cold Hebrid isle,\r\n      To that hoar pile which still its ruins shows;\r\n    In whose small vaults a pygmy folk is found,\r\n      Whose bones the delver with his spade upthrows,\r\n    And culls them, wondering, from the hallowed ground;\r\n    Or thither, where, beneath the showery west,\r\n      The mighty kings of three fair realms are laid;\r\n    Once foes, perhaps, together now they rest,\r\n      No slaves revere them and no wars invade.\r\n    Yet frequent now at midnight's solemn hour,\r\n      The rifted mounds their yawning cells unfold,\r\n    And forth the monarchs stalk with sovereign power,\r\n      In pageant robes, and wreathed with sheeny gold,\r\n      And on their twilight tombs aerial council hold.\"\r\n\r\nCollins' work was all done by 1749; for though he survived ten years\r\nlonger, his mind was in eclipse.  He was a lover and student of\r\nShakspere, and when the Wartons paid him a last visit at the time of his\r\nresidence with his sister in the cloisters of Chichester Cathedral, he\r\ntold Thomas that he had discovered the source of the \"Tempest,\" in a\r\nnovel called \"Aurelio and Isabella,\" printed in 1588 in Spanish, Italian,\r\nFrench, and English.  No such novel has been found, and it was seemingly\r\na figment of Collins' disordered fancy.  During a lucid interval in the\r\ncourse of this visit, he read to the Wartons, from the manuscript, his\r\n\"Ode on the Superstitions of the Scottish Highlands\"; and also a poem\r\nwhich is lost, entitled, \"The Bell of Arragon,\" founded on the legend of\r\nthe great bell of Saragossa that tolled of its own accord whenever a king\r\nof Spain was dying.\r\n\r\nJohnson was also a friend of Collins, and spoke of him kindly in his\r\n\"Lives of the Poets,\" though he valued his writings little.  \"He had\r\nemployed his mind chiefly upon works of fiction and subjects of fancy;\r\nand by indulging some peculiar habits of thought, was eminently delighted\r\nwith those flights of imagination which pass the bounds of nature, and to\r\nwhich the mind is reconciled only by a passive acquiescence in popular\r\ntraditions.  He loved fairies, genii, giants, and monsters; he delighted\r\nto rove through the meanders of enchantment, to gaze on the magnificence\r\nof golden palaces, to repose by the water-falls of Elysian gardens.  This\r\nwas, however, the character rather of his inclination than his genius;\r\nthe grandeur of wildness and the novelty of extravagance were always\r\ndesired by him, but were not always attained.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThomas Gray is a much more important figure than Collins in the\r\nintellectual history of his generations; but this superior importance\r\ndoes not rest entirely upon his verse, which is hardly more abundant than\r\nCollins', though of a higher finish.  His letters, journals, and other\r\nprose remains, posthumously published, first showed how long an arc his\r\nmind had subtended on the circle of art and thought.  He was sensitive to\r\nall fine influences that were in the literary air.  One of the greatest\r\nscholars among English poets, his taste was equal to his acquisitions.\r\nHe was a sound critic of poetry, music, architecture, and painting.  His\r\nmind and character both had distinction; and if there was something a\r\ntrifle finical and old-maidish about his personality--which led the young\r\nCantabs on one occasion to take a rather brutal advantage of his nervous\r\ndread of fire--there was also that nice reserve which gave to Milton,\r\nwhen _he_ was at Cambridge, the nickname of the \"lady of Christ's.\"\r\n\r\nA few of Gray's simpler odes, the \"Ode on the Spring,\" the \"Hymn to\r\nAdversity\" and the Eton College ode, were written in 1742 and printed in\r\nDodsley's collection in 1748.  The \"Elegy\" was published in 1751; the two\r\n\"sister odes,\" \"The Progress of Poesy\" and \"The Bard,\" were struck off\r\nfrom Horace Walpole's private press at Strawberry Hill in 1757.  Gray's\r\npopular fame rests, and will always rest, upon his immortal \"Elegy.\"  He\r\nhimself denied somewhat impatiently that it was his best poem, and\r\nthought that its popularity was owing to its subject.  There are not\r\nwanting critics of authority, such as Lowell and Matthew Arnold, who have\r\npronounced Gray's odes higher poetry than his \"Elegy.\"  \"'The Progress of\r\nPoesy,'\" says Lowell, \"overflies all other English lyrics like an\r\neagle. . .  It was the prevailing blast of Gray's trumpet that, more than\r\nanything else, called men back to the legitimate standard.\"[31]  With all\r\ndeference to such distinguished judges, I venture to think that the\r\npopular instinct on this point is right, and even that Dr. Johnson is not\r\nso wrong as usual.  Johnson disliked Gray and spoke of him with surly\r\ninjustice.  Gray, in turn, could not abide Johnson, whom he called _Ursa\r\nmajor_.  Johnson said that Gray's odes were forced plants, raised in a\r\nhot-house, and poor plants at that. \"Sir, I do not think Gray a\r\nfirst-rate poet.  He has not a bold imagination, nor much command of\r\nwords.  The obscurity in which he has involved himself will not persuade\r\nus that he is sublime.  His 'Elegy in a Churchyard' has a happy selection\r\nof images, but I don't like what are called his great things.\"  \"He\r\nattacked Gray, calling him a 'dull fellow.'  Boswell: 'I understand he\r\nwas reserved, and might appear dull in company; but surely he was not\r\ndull in poetry.'  Johnson: 'Sir, he was dull in company, dull in his\r\ncloset, dull everywhere.  He was dull in a new way and that made many\r\npeople think him GREAT.  He was a mechanical poet.'  He then repeated\r\nsome ludicrous lines, which have escaped my memory, and said, 'Is not\r\nthat GREAT, like his odes?'. . .  'No, sir, there are but two good\r\nstanzas in Gray's poetry, which are in his \"Elegy in a Country\r\nChurchyard.\"  He then repeated the stanza--\r\n\r\n    \"'For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,'\" etc.\r\n\r\n\"In all Gray's odes,\" wrote Johnson, \"there is a kind of cumbrous\r\nsplendor which we wish away. . .  These odes are marked by glittering\r\naccumulations of ungraceful ornaments; they strike rather than please;\r\nthe images are magnified by affectation; the language is labored into\r\nharshness.  The mind of the writer seems to work with unnatural\r\nviolence. . .  His art and his struggle are too visible and there is too\r\nlittle appearance of ease and nature. . .  In the character of his\r\n'Elegy,' I rejoice to concur with the common reader; for by the common\r\nsense of readers uncorrupted with literary prejudices, after all the\r\nrefinements of subtlety and the dogmatism of learning, must be finally\r\ndecided all claims to poetical honors.  The 'Churchyard' abounds with\r\nimages which find a mirror in every mind, and with sentiments to which\r\nevery bosom returns an echo.\"\r\n\r\nThere are noble lines in Gray's more elaborate odes, but they do make as\r\na whole that mechanical, artificial impression of which Johnson\r\ncomplains.  They have the same rhetorical ring, the worked-up fervor in\r\nplace of genuine passion, which was noted in Collins' ode \"On the\r\nPassions.\"  Collins and Gray were perpetually writing about the passions;\r\nbut they treated them as abstractions and were quite incapable of\r\nexhibiting them in action.  Neither of them could have written a ballad,\r\na play, or a romance.  Their odes were bookish, literary, impersonal,\r\nretrospective.  They had too much of the ichor of fancy and too little\r\nred blood in them.\r\n\r\nBut the \"Elegy\" is the masterpiece of this whole \"Il Penseroso\" school,\r\nand has summed up for all English readers, for all time, the poetry of\r\nthe tomb.  Like the \"Essay on Man,\" and \"Night Thoughts\" and \"The Grave,\"\r\nit is a poem of the moral-didactic order, but very different in result\r\nfrom these.  Its moral is suffused with emotion and expressed concretely.\r\nInstead of general reflections upon the shortness of life, the vanity of\r\nambition, the leveling power of death, and similar commonplaces, we have\r\nthe picture of the solitary poet, lingering among the graves at twilight\r\n(_hora datur quieti_), till the place and the hour conspire to work their\r\neffect upon the mind and prepare it for the strain of meditation that\r\nfollows.  The universal appeal of its subject and the perfection of its\r\nstyle have made the \"Elegy\" known by heart to more readers than any other\r\npoem in the language.  Parody is one proof of celebrity, if not of\r\npopularity, and the \"sister odes\" were presently parodied by Lloyd and\r\nColman in an \"Ode to Obscurity\" and an \"Ode to Oblivion.\"  But the\r\n\"Elegy\" was more than celebrated and more than popular; it was the most\r\nadmired and influential poem of the generation.  The imitations and\r\ntranslations of it are innumerable, and it met with a response as\r\nimmediate as it was general.[32]  One effect of this was to consecrate\r\nthe ten-syllabled quatrain to elegiac uses.  Mason altered the sub-title\r\nof his \"Isis\" (written in 1748) from \"An Elegy\" to \"A Monologue,\" because\r\nit was \"not written in alternate rimes, which since Mr. Gray's exquisite\r\n'Elegy in the Country Church-yard' has generally obtained, and seems to\r\nbe more suited to that species of poem.\"[33]  Mason's \"Elegy written in a\r\nChurch-yard in South Wales\" (1787) is, of course, in Gray's stanza and,\r\nequally of course, introduces a tribute to the master:\r\n\r\n    \"Yes, had he paced this church-way path along,\r\n      Or leaned like me against this ivied wall,\r\n    How sadly sweet had flowed his Dorian song,\r\n      Then sweetest when it flowed at Nature's call.\"[34]\r\n\r\nIt became almost _de rigueur_ for a young poet to try his hand at a\r\nchurchyard piece.  Thus Richard Cumberland, the dramatist, in his\r\n\"Memoirs,\" records the fact that when he was an undergraduate at\r\nCambridge in 1752 he made his \"first small offering to the press,\r\nfollowing the steps of Gray with another church-yard elegy, written on\r\nSt. Mark's Eve, when, according to rural tradition, the ghost of those\r\nwho are to die within the year ensuing are seen to walk at midnight\r\nacross the churchyard.\"[35]  Goldsmith testifies to the prevalence of the\r\nfashion when, in his \"Life of Parnell,\" he says of that poet's \"Night\r\nPiece on Death\"[36] that, \"with very little amendment,\" it \"might be made\r\nto surpass all those night-pieces and church-yard scenes that have since\r\nappeared.\"  But in this opinion Johnson, who says that Parnell's poem \"is\r\nindirectly preferred by Goldsmith to Gray's 'Churchyard,'\" does not\r\nagree; nor did the public.[37]\r\n\r\nGray's correspondence affords a record of the progress of romantic\r\ntaste for an entire generation.  He set out with classical\r\nprepossessions--forming his verse, as he declared, after Dryden--and\r\nended with translations from Welsh and Norse hero-legends, and with an\r\nadmiration for Ossian and Scotch ballads.  In 1739 he went to France and\r\nItaly with Horace Walpole.  He was abroad three years, though in 1741 he\r\nquarreled with Walpole at Florence, separated from him and made his way\r\nhome alone in a leisurely manner.  Gray is one of the first of modern\r\ntravelers to speak appreciatively of Gothic architecture, and of the\r\nscenery of the Alps, and to note those strange and characteristic aspects\r\nof foreign life which we now call picturesque, and to which every\r\nitinerary and guidebook draws attention.  Addison, who was on his travels\r\nforty years before, was quite blind to such matters.  Not that he was\r\nwithout the feeling of the sublime: he finds, _e.g._, an \"agreeable\r\nhorror\" in the prospect of a storm at sea.[38]  But he wrote of his\r\npassage through Switzerland as a disagreeable and even frightful\r\nexperience; \"a very troublesome journey over the Alps.  My head is still\r\ngiddy with mountains and precipices; and you can't imagine how much I am\r\npleased with the sight of a plain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let any one reflect,\" says the _Spectator_,[39] \"on the disposition of\r\nmind he finds in himself at his first entrance into the Pantheon at Rome,\r\nand how his imagination is filled with something great and amazing; and,\r\nat the same time, consider how little, in proportion, he is affected with\r\nthe inside of a Gothic cathedral, though it be five times larger than the\r\nother; which can arise from nothing else but the greatness of the manner\r\nin the one, the meanness in the other.\"[40]\r\n\r\nGray describes the cathedral at Rheims as \"a vast Gothic building of a\r\nsurprising beauty and lightness, all covered over with a profusion of\r\nlittle statues and other ornaments\"; and the cathedral at Siena, which\r\nAddison had characterized as \"barbarous,\" and as an instance of \"false\r\nbeauties and affected ornaments,\" Gray commends as \"labored with a Gothic\r\nniceness and delicacy in the old-fashioned way.\"  It must be acknowledged\r\nthat these are rather cold praises, but Gray was continually advancing in\r\nhis knowledge of Gothic and his liking for it.  Later in life he became\r\nsomething of an antiquarian and virtuoso.  He corresponded with Rev.\r\nThomas Wharton, about stained glass and paper hangings, which Wharton,\r\nwho was refitting his house in the Gothic taste, had commissioned Gray to\r\nbuy for him of London dealers.  He describes, for Wharton's benefit,\r\nWalpole's new bedroom at Strawberry Hill as \"in the best taste of\r\nanything he has yet done, and in your own Gothic way\"; and he advises his\r\ncorrespondent as to the selection of patterns for staircases and arcade\r\nwork.  There was evidently a great stir of curiosity concerning\r\nStrawberry Hill in Gray's coterie, and a determination to be Gothic at\r\nall hazards; and the poet felt obliged to warn his friends that zeal\r\nshould not outrun discretion.  He writes to Wharton in 1754: \"I rejoice\r\nto find you at last settled to your heart's content, and delight to hear\r\nyou talk of giving your house some _Gothic ornaments_ already.  If you\r\nproject anything, I hope it will be entirely within doors; and don't let\r\nme (when I come gaping into Coleman Street) be directed to the gentlemen\r\nat the ten pinnacles, or with the church porch at his door.\"  Again, to\r\nthe same (1761): \"It is mere pedantry in Gothicism to stick to nothing\r\nbut altars and tombs, and there is no end to it, if we are to sit upon\r\nnothing but coronation chairs, nor drink out of nothing but chalices or\r\nflagons.\"  Writing to Mason in 1758 about certain incongruities in one of\r\nthe latter's odes, he gives the following Doresque illustration of his\r\npoint.  \"If you should lead me into a superb Gothic building, with a\r\nthousand clustered pillars, each of them half a mile high, the walls all\r\ncovered with fret-work, and the windows full of red and blue saints that\r\nhad neither head nor tail, and I should find the Venus de Medici in\r\nperson perked up in a long niche over the high altar, as naked as she was\r\nborn, do you think it would raise or damp my devotions?\"[41]  He made it\r\na favorite occupation to visit and take drawings from celebrated ruins\r\nand the great English cathedrals, particularly those in the Cambridge\r\nfens, Ely and Peterboro'.  These studies he utilized in a short essay on\r\nNorman architecture, first published by Mitford in 1814, and incorrectly\r\nentitled \"Architectura Gothica.\"\r\n\r\nReverting to his early letters from abroad one is struck by the\r\nanticipation of the modern attitude, in his description of a visit to the\r\nGrande Chartreuse, which he calls \"one of the most solemn, the most\r\nromantic, and the most astonishing scenes.\"[42]  \"I do not remember to\r\nhave gone ten paces without an exclamation that there was no restraining.\r\nNot a precipice, not a torrent, not a cliff, but is pregnant with\r\nreligion and poetry. . .  One need not have a very fantastic imagination\r\nto see spirits there at noonday.\"[43]  Walpole's letter of about the same\r\ndate, also to West,[44] is equally ecstatic.  It is written \"from a\r\nhamlet among the mountains of Savoy. . .  Here we are, the lonely lords\r\nof glorious desolate prospects. . .  But the road, West, the road!\r\nWinding round a prodigious mountain, surrounded with others, all shagged\r\nwith hanging woods, obscured with pines, or lost in clouds!  Below a\r\ntorrent breaking through cliffs, and tumbling through fragments of\r\nrocks!. . .  Now and then an old foot bridge, with a broken rail, a\r\nleaning cross, a cottage or the ruin of an hermitage!  This sounds too\r\nbombast and too romantic to one that has not seen it, too cold for one\r\nthat has.\"  Or contrast with Addison's Italian letters passages like\r\nthese, which foretoken Rogers and Byron.  We get nothing so sympathetic\r\ntill at least a half century later.  \"It is the most beautiful of Italian\r\nnights. . .  There is a moon!  There are starts for you!  Do not you hear\r\nthe fountain?  Do not you smell the orange flowers?  That building yonder\r\nis the convent of St. Isidore; and that eminence with the cypress-trees\r\nand pines upon it, the top of Mt. Quirinal.\"[45]  \"The Neapolitans work\r\ntill evening: then take their lute or guitar and walk about the city, or\r\nupon the sea shore with it, to enjoy the _fresco_.  One sees their little\r\nbrown children jumping about stark naked and the bigger ones dancing with\r\ncastanets, while others play on the cymbal to them.\"[46]  \"Kennst dud as\r\nLand,\" then already?  The\r\n\r\n                \"small voices and an old guitar,\r\n    Winning their way to an unguarded heart\"?\r\n\r\nAnd then, for a prophecy of Scott, read the description of Netley\r\nAbbey,[47] in a letter to Nicholls in 1764.  \"My ferryman,\" writes Gray\r\nin a letter to Brown about the same ruin, \"assured me that he would not\r\ngo near it in the night time for all the world, though he knew much money\r\nhad been found there. The sun was all too glaring and too full of gauds\r\nfor such a scene, which ought to be visited only in the dusk of the\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\n    \"If thou woulds't view fair Melrose aright\r\n    Go visit it by the pale moonlight,\r\n    For the gay beams of lightsome day\r\n    Gild, but to flout, the ruins, Gray.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1765, Gray visited the Scotch Highlands and sent enthusiastic\r\nhistories of his trip to Wharton and Mason.  \"Since I saw the Alps, I\r\nhave seen nothing sublime till now.\"  \"The Lowlands are worth seeing\r\nonce, but the mountains are ecstatic, and ought to be visited in\r\npilgrimage once a year.  None but those monstrous creatures of God know\r\nhow to join so much beauty with so much horror.  A fig for your poets,\r\npainters, gardeners, and clergymen that have not been among them.\"\r\n\r\nAgain in 1770, the year before his death, he spent six weeks on a ramble\r\nthrough the western counties, descending the Wye in a boat for forty\r\nmiles, and visiting among other spots which the muse had then, or has\r\nsince, made illustrious, Hagley and the Leasowes, the Malvern Hills and\r\nTintern Abby.  But the most significant of Gray's \"Lilliputian travels,\"\r\nwas his tour of the Lake Country in 1769.  Here he was on ground that has\r\nsince become classic; and the lover of Wordsworth encounters with a\r\nsingular interest, in Gray's \"Journal in the Lakes,\" written nearly\r\nthirty years before the \"Lyrical Ballads,\" names like Grasmere, Winander,\r\nSkiddaw, Helvellyn, Derwentwater, Borrowdale, and Lodore.  What\r\ndistinguishes the entries in this journal from contemporary writing of\r\nthe descriptive kind is a certain intimacy of comprehension, a depth of\r\ntone which makes them seem like nineteenth-century work. To Gray the\r\nlandscape was no longer a picture.  It had sentiment, character, meaning,\r\nalmost personality.  Different weathers and different hours of the day\r\nlent it expressions subtler than the poets had hitherto recognized in the\r\nbroad, general changes of storm and calm, light and darkness, and the\r\nsuccessions of the seasons.  He heard Nature when she whispered, as well\r\nas when she spoke out loud.  Thomson could not have written thus, nor\r\nShenstone, nor even, perhaps, Collins.  But almost any man of cultivation\r\nand sensibility can write so now; or, if not so well, yet with the same\r\naccent.  A passage or two will make my meaning clearer.\r\n\r\n\"To this second turning I pursued my way about four miles along its\r\nborders [Ulswater], beyond a village scattered among trees and called\r\nWater Mallock, in a pleasant, grave day, perfectly calm and warm, but\r\nwithout a gleam of sunshine.  Then, the sky seeming to thicken, the\r\nvalley to grown more desolate, and evening drawing on, I returned by the\r\nway I came to Penrith. . .  While I was here, a little shower fell, red\r\nclouds came marching up the hills from the east, and part of a bright\r\nrainbow seemed to rise along the side of Castle Hill. . .  The calmness\r\nand brightness of the evening, the roar of the waters, and the thumping\r\nof huge hammers at an iron forge not far distant, made it a singular\r\nwalk. . .  In the evening walked alone down to the lake after sunset and\r\nsaw the solemn coloring of night draw on, the last gleam of sunshine\r\nfading away on the hilltops, the deep serene of the waters, and the long\r\nshadows of the mountains thrown across them till they nearly touched the\r\nhithermost shore.  At distance heard the murmur of many waterfalls not\r\naudible in the day-time.[48]  Wished for the moon, but she was dark to me\r\nand silent, hid in her vacant inter-lunar cave.\"[49]\r\n\r\n\"It is only within a few years,\" wrote Joseph Warton in 1782, \"that the\r\npicturesque scenes of our own country, our lakes, mountains, cascades,\r\ncaverns, and castles, have been visited and described.\"[50]  It was in\r\nthis very year that William Gilpin published his \"Observations on the\r\nRiver Wye,\" from notes taken upon a tour in 1770.  This was the same year\r\nwhen Gray made his tour of the Wye, and hearing that Gilpin had prepared\r\na description of the region, he borrowed and read his manuscript in June,\r\n1771, a few weeks before his own death.  These \"Observations\" were the\r\nfirst of a series of volumes by Gilpin on the scenery of Great Britain,\r\ncomposed in a poetic and somewhat over-luxuriant style, illustrated by\r\ndrawings in aquatinta, and all described on the title page as \"Relative\r\nchiefly to Picturesque Beauty.\"  They had great success, and several of\r\nthem were translated into German and French.[51]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"An Apology for Smectymnuus.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Lines 162-168.

Francis Peck, in his \"New Memoirs of the Life and Poetical\r\nWorks of Mr. John Milton,\" in 1740, says that these two poems are justly\r\nadmired by foreigners as well as Englishmen, and have therefore been\r\ntranslated into all the modern languages.

The captain describes the\r\nromantic scenery of the glens as \"horrid prospects.\"  It was considerably\r\nlater in the century that Dr. Johnson said, in answer to Boswell's timid\r\nsuggestion that Scotland had a great many noble wild prospects, \"I\r\nbelieve, sir, you have a great many, Norway, too, has noble wild\r\nprospects, and Lapland is remarkable for prodigious noble wild prospects.\r\nBut, sir, let me tell you, the noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever\r\nsees is the high-road that leads him to England.\"\r\n\r\n[41] See also Gray's letter to Rev.

Though the literary\r\nmovement had already begun to take a retrospective turn, few distinctly\r\nmediaeval elements were yet in evidence.  Neither the literature of the\r\nmonk nor the literature of the knight had suffered resurrection.  It was\r\nnot until about 1760 that writers began to gravitate decidedly toward the\r\nMiddle Ages.  The first peculiarly mediaeval type that contrived to\r\nsecure a foothold in eighteenth-century literature was the hermit, a\r\nfigure which seems to have had a natural attraction, not only for\r\nromanticizing poets like Shenstone and Collins, but for the whole\r\ngeneration of verse writers from Parnell to Goldsmith, Percy and\r\nBeattie--each of whom composed a \"Hermit\"--and even for the authors of\r\n\"Rasselas\" and \"Tom Jones,\" in whose fictions he becomes a stock\r\ncharacter, as a fountain of wisdom and of moral precepts.[1]\r\n\r\nA literary movement which reverts to the past for its inspiration is\r\nnecessarily also a learned movement.  Antiquarian scholarship must lead\r\nthe way.  The picture of an extinct society has to be pieced together\r\nfrom the fragments at hand, and this involves special research.  So long\r\nas this special knowledge remains the exclusive possession of\r\nprofessional antiquaries like Gough, Hearne, Bentham, Perry, Grose,[2] it\r\nbears no fruit in creative literature.  It produces only local histories,\r\nsurveys of cathedrals and of sepulchral monuments, books about Druidic\r\nremains, Roman walls and coins, etc., etc.  It was only when men of\r\nimagination and of elegant tastes were enlisted in such pursuits that the\r\ndry stick of antiquarianism put forth blossoms.  The poets, of course,\r\nhad to make studies of their own, to decipher manuscripts, learn Old\r\nEnglish, visit ruins, collect ballads and ancient armor, familiarize\r\nthemselves with terms of heraldry, architecture, chivalry, ecclesiology\r\nand feudal law, and in other such ways inform and stimulate their\r\nimaginations.  It was many years before the joint labors of scholars and\r\npoets had reconstructed an image of medieval society, sharp enough in\r\noutline and brilliant enough in color to impress itself upon the general\r\npublic.  Scott, indeed, was the first to popularize romance; mainly, no\r\ndoubt, because of the greater power and fervor of his imagination; but\r\nalso, in part, because an ampler store of materials had been already\r\naccumulated when he began work.  He had fed on Percy's \"Reliques\" in\r\nboyhood; through Coleridge, his verse derives from Chatterton; and the\r\nline of Gothic romances which starts with \"The Castle of Otranto\" is\r\nremotely responsible for \"Ivanhoe\" and \"The Talisman.\"  But Scott too\r\nwas, like Percy and Walpole, a virtuoso and collector; and the vast\r\napparatus of notes and introductory matter in his metrical tales, and in\r\nthe Waverley novels, shows how necessary it was for the romantic poet to\r\nbe his own antiquary.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the zeal of the first romanticists was not always\r\na zeal according to knowledge, and the picture of the Middle Age which\r\nthey painted was more of a caricature than a portrait.  A large share of\r\nmedieval literature was inaccessible to the general reader.  Much of it\r\nwas still in manuscript.  Much more of it was in old and rare printed\r\ncopies, broadsides and black-letter folios, the treasure of great\r\nlibraries and of jealously hoarded private collections.  Much was in\r\ndialects little understood-forgotten forms of speech-Old French, Middle\r\nHigh German, Old Norse, medieval Latin, the ancient Erse and Cymric\r\ntongues, Anglo-Saxon.  There was an almost total lack of apparatus for\r\nthe study of this literature.  Helps were needed in the shape of modern\r\nreprints of scarce texts, bibliographies, critical editions,\r\ntranslations, literary histories and manuals, glossaries of archaic\r\nwords, dictionaries and grammars of obsolete languages.  These were\r\ngradually supplied by working specialists in different fields of\r\ninvestigation.  Every side of medieval life has received illustration in\r\nits turn.  Works like Tyrwhitt's edition of Chaucer (1775-78); the\r\ncollections of mediaeval romances by Ellis (1805), Ritson (1802), and\r\nWeber (1810); Nares' and Halliwell's \"Archaic Glossary\" (1822-46),\r\nCarter's \"Specimens of Ancient Sculpture and Paintings\" (1780-94),\r\nScott's \"Demonology and Witchcraft\" (1830),  Hallam's \"Middle Ages\"\r\n(1818), Meyrick's \"Ancient Armour\" (1824), Lady Guest's \"Mabinogion\"\r\n(1838), the publications of numberless individual scholars and of learned\r\nsocieties like the Camden, the Spenser, the Percy, the Chaucer, the Early\r\nEnglish Text, the Roxburgh Club,--to mention only English examples, taken\r\nat random and separated from each other by wide intervals of time,--are\r\ninstances of the labors by which mediaeval life has been made familiar to\r\nall who might choose to make acquaintance with it.\r\n\r\nThe history of romanticism, after the impulse had once been given, is\r\nlittle else than a record or the steps by which, one after another, new\r\nfeatures of that vast and complicated scheme of things which we loosely\r\ncall the Middle Ages were brought to light and made available as literary\r\nmaterial.  The picture was constantly having fresh details added to it,\r\nnor is there any reason to believe that it is finished yet.  Some of the\r\nfinest pieces of mediaeval work have only within the last few years been\r\nbrought to the attention of the general reader; _e.g._, the charming old\r\nFrench story in prose and verse, \"Aucassin et Nicolete,\" and the\r\nfourteenth-century English poem, \"The Perle.\"  The future holds still\r\nother phases of romanticism in reserve; the Middle Age seems likely to be\r\nas inexhaustible in novel sources of inspiration as classical antiquity\r\nhas already proved to be.  The past belongs to the poet no less than the\r\npresent, and a great part of the literature of every generation will\r\nalways be retrospective.  The tastes and preferences of the individual\r\nartist will continue to find a wide field for selection in the rich\r\nquarry of Christian and feudal Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little odd that the book which first aroused, in modern\r\nEurope, an interest in Norse mythology should have been written by a\r\nFrenchman.  This was the \"Introduction à l'Histoire de Dannemarc,\"\r\npublished in 1755 by Paul Henri Mallet, a native of Geneva and sometime\r\nprofessor of Belles Lettres in the Royal University at Copenhagen.  The\r\nwork included also a translation of the first part of the Younger Edda,\r\nwith an abstract of the second part and of the Elder Edda, and versions\r\nof several Runic poems.  It was translated into English, in 1770, by\r\nThomas Percy, the editor of the \"Reliques,\" under the title, \"Northern\r\nAntiquities; or a Description of the Manners, Customs, Religion, and Laws\r\nof the ancient Danes.\"  A German translation had appeared a few years\r\nearlier and had inspired the Schleswig-Holsteiner, Heinrich Wilhem von\r\nGerstenberg, to compose his \"Gedicht eines Skalden,\" which introduced the\r\nold Icelandic mythology into German poetry in 1766.  Percy had published\r\nindependently in 1763 \"Five Pieces of Runic Poetry, translated from the\r\nIcelandic Language.\"\r\n\r\nGray did not wait for the English translation of Mallet's book.  In a\r\nletter to Mason, dated in 1758, and inclosing some criticisims on the\r\nlatter's \"Caractacus\" (then in MS.), he wrote, \"I am pleased with the\r\nGothic Elysium.  Do you think I am ignorant about either that, or the\r\n_hell_ before, or the _twilight_.[3]  I have been there and have seen it\r\nall in Mallet's 'Introduction to the History of Denmark' (it is in\r\nFrench), and many other places.\"  It is a far cry from Mallet's \"System\r\nof Runic Mythology\" to William Morris' \"Sigurd the Volsung\" (1877), but\r\nto Mallet belongs the credit of first exciting that interest in\r\nScandinavian antiquity which has enriched the prose and poetry not only\r\nof England but of Europe in general.  Gray refers to him in his notes on\r\n\"The Descent of Odin,\" and his work continued to be popular authority on\r\nits subject for at least half a century.  Scott cites it in his\r\nannotations on \"The Lay of the Last Minstrel\" (1805).\r\n\r\n\r\nGray's studies in Runic literature took shape in \"The Fatal Sisters\" and\r\n\"The Descent of Odin,\" written in 1761, published in 1768.  These were\r\nparaphrases of two poems which Gray found in the \"De Causis Contemnendae\r\nMortis\" (Copenhagen, 1689) of Thomas Bartholin, a Danish physician of the\r\nseventeenth century.  The first of them describes the Valkyrie weaving\r\nthe fates of the Danish and Irish warriors in the battle of Clontarf,\r\nfought in the eleventh century between Sigurd, Earl of Orkney, and Brian,\r\nKing of Dublin; the second narrates the descent of Odin to Niflheimer, to\r\ninquire of Hela concerning the doom of Balder.[4]  Gray had designed\r\nthese for the introductory chapter of his projected history of English\r\npoetry.  He calls them imitations, which in fact they are, rather than\r\nliteral renderings.  In spite of a tinge of eighteenth-century diction,\r\nand of one or two Shaksperian and Miltonic phrases, the translator\r\nsucceeded fairly well in reproducing the wild air of his originals.  His\r\nbiographer, Mr. Gosse, promises that \"the student will not fail . . . in\r\nthe Gothic picturesqueness of 'The Descent of Odin,' to detect notes and\r\nphrases of a more delicate originality than are to be found even in his\r\nmore famous writings; and will dwell with peculiar pleasure on those\r\npassages in which Gray freed himself of the trammels of an artificial and\r\nconventional taste, and prophesied of the new romantic age that was\r\ncoming.\"\r\n\r\nCeltic antiquity shared with Gothic in this newly around interest.  Here\r\ntoo, as in the phrase about \"the stormy Hebrides,\" \"Lycidas\" seems to\r\nhave furnished the spark that kindled the imaginations of the poets.\r\n\r\n    \"Where were ye, nymphs, when the remorseless deep\r\n    Closed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas?\r\n    For neither were ye playing on the steep\r\n    Where your old bards, the famous Druids lie,\r\n    Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,\r\n    Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Warton quotes this passage twice in his \"Essay on Pope\" (Vol I.,\r\npp. 7 and 356, 5th ed.), once to assert its superiority to a passage in\r\nPope's \"Pastorals\": \"The mention of places remarkably romantic, the\r\nsupposed habitation of Druids, bards and wizards, is far more pleasing to\r\nthe imagination, than the obvious introduction of Cam and Isis.\"  Another\r\ntime, to illustrate the following suggestion: \"I have frequently wondered\r\nthat our modern writers have made so little use of the druidical times\r\nand the traditions of the old bards. . .  Milton, we see, was sensible of\r\nthe force of such imagery, as we may gather from this short but exquisite\r\npassage.\"  As further illustrations of the poetic capabilities of similar\r\nthemes, Warton gives a stanza from Gray's \"Bard\" and some lines from\r\nGilbert West's \"Institution of the Order of the Garter\" which describe\r\nthe ghosts of the Druids hovering about their ruined altars at Stonehenge:\r\n\r\n                \"--Mysterious rows\r\n    Of rude enormous obelisks, that rise\r\n    Orb within orb, stupendous monuments\r\n    Of artless architecture, such as now\r\n    Oft-times amaze the wandering traveler,\r\n    By the pale moon discerned on Sarum's plain.\"\r\n\r\nHe then inserts two stanzas, in the Latin of Hickes' \"Thesaurus,\" of an\r\nold Runic ode preserved by Olaus Wormius (Ole Worm) and adds an\r\nobservation upon the Scandinavian heroes and their contempt of death.\r\nDruids and bards now begin to abound.  Collins' \"Ode on the Death of Mr.\r\nThomson,\" _e.g._, commences with the line\r\n\r\n    \"In yonder grave a Druid lies.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"Ode to Liberty,\" he alludes to the tradition that Mona, the\r\ndruidic stronghold, was long covered with an enchantment of mist--work of\r\nan angry mermaid:\r\n\r\n    \"Mona, once hid from those who search the main,\r\n    Where thousand elfin shapes abide.\"\r\n\r\nIn Thomas Warton's \"Pleasures of Melancholy,\" Contemplation is fabled to\r\nhave been discovered, when a babe, by a Druid\r\n\r\n    \"Far in a hollow glade of Mona's woods,\"\r\n\r\nand borne by him to his oaken bower, where she\r\n\r\n                \"--loved to lie\r\n    Oft deeply listening to the rapid roar\r\n    Of wood-hung Menai, stream of druids old.\"\r\n\r\nMason's \"Caractacus\" (1759) was a dramatic poem on the Greek model, with\r\na chorus of British bards, and a principal Druid for choragus.  The scene\r\nis the sacred grove in Mona.  Mason got up with much care the description\r\nof druidic rites, such as the preparation of the adder-stone and the\r\ncutting of the mistletoe with a gold sickle, from Latin authorities like\r\nPliny, Tacitus, Lucan, Strabo, and Suetonius.  Joseph Warton commends\r\nhighly the chorus on \"Death\" in this piece, as well as the chorus of\r\nbards at the end of West's \"Institution of the Garter.\"  For the\r\nmaterials of his \"Bard\" Gray had to go no farther than historians and\r\nchroniclers such as Camden, Higden, and Matthew of Westminster, to all of\r\nwhom he refers.  Following a now discredited tradition, he represents the\r\nlast survivor of the Welsh poetic guild, seated, harp in hand, upon a\r\ncrag on the side of Snowdon, and denouncing judgment on Edward I, for the\r\nmurder of his brothers in song.\r\n\r\nBut in 1764 Gray was incited, by the publication of Dr. Evans'\r\n\"Specimens,\"[5] to attempt a few translations from the Welsh.  The most\r\nconsiderable of these was \"The Triumphs of Owen,\" published among Gray's\r\ncollected poems in 1768.  This celebrates the victory over the\r\nconfederate fleets of Ireland, Denmark, and Normandy, won about 1160 by a\r\nprince of North Wales, Owen Ap Griffin, \"the dragon son on Mona.\"  The\r\nother fragments are brief but spirited versions of bardic songs in praise\r\nof fallen heroes: \"Caràdoc,\" \"Conan,\" and \"The Death of Hoel.\"  They were\r\nprinted posthumously, though doubtless composed in 1764.\r\n\r\nThe scholarship of the day was not always accurate in discriminating\r\nbetween ancient systems of religion, and Gray, in his letters to Mason in\r\n1758, when \"Caractacus\" was still in the works, takes him to task for\r\nmixing the Gothic and Celtic mythologies.  He instructs him that Woden\r\nand his Valhalla belong to \"the doctrine of the Scalds, not of the\r\nBards\"; but admits that, \"in that scarcity of Celtic ideas we labor\r\nunder,\" it might be permissible to borrow from the Edda, \"dropping,\r\nhowever, all mention of Woden and his Valkyrian virgins,\" and \"without\r\nentering too minutely on particulars\"; or \"still better, to graft any\r\nwild picturesque fable, absolutely of one's own invention, upon the Druid\r\nstock.\"  But Gray had not scrupled to mix mythologies in \"The Bard,\"\r\nthereby incurring Dr. Johnson's censure.  \"The weaving of the winding\r\nsheet he borrowed, as he owns, from the northern bards; but their\r\ntexture, however, was very properly the work of female powers, as the art\r\nof spinning the thread of life in another mythology.  Theft is always\r\ndangerous: Gray has made weavers of the slaughtered bards, by a fiction\r\noutrageous and incongruous.\"[6]  Indeed Mallet himself had a very\r\nconfused notion of the relation of the Celtic to the Teutonic race.  He\r\nspeaks constantly of the old Scandinavians as Celts.  Percy points out\r\nthe difference, in the preface to his translation, and makes the\r\nnecessary correction in the text, where the word Celtic occurs--usually\r\nby substituting \"Gothic and Celtic\" for the \"Celtic\" of the original.\r\nMason made his contribution to Runic literature, \"Song of Harold the\r\nValiant,\" a rather insipid versification of a passage from the \"Knytlinga\r\nSaga,\" which had been rendered by Bartholin into Latin, from him into\r\nFrench by Mallet, and from Mallet into English prose by Percy.  Mason\r\ndesigned it for insertion in the introduction to Gray's abortive history\r\nof English poetry.\r\n\r\nThe true pioneers of the mediaeval revival were the Warton brothers.\r\n\"The school of Warton\" was a term employed, not without disparaging\r\nimplications, by critics who had no liking for antique minstrelsy.\r\nJoseph and Thomas Warton were the sons of Thomas Warton, vicar of\r\nBasingstoke, who had been a fellow of Magdalen and Professor of Poetry at\r\nOxford; which latter position was afterward filled by the younger of his\r\ntwo sons.  It is interesting to note that a volume of verse by Thomas\r\nWarton, Sr., posthumously printed in 1748, includes a Spenserian\r\nimitation and translations of two passages from the \"Song of Ragner\r\nLodbrog,\" an eleventh-century Viking, after the Latin version quoted by\r\nSir Wm. Temple in his essay \"Of Heroic Virtue\";[7] so that the romantic\r\nleanings of the Warton brothers seem to be an instance of heredity.\r\nJoseph was educated at Winchester,--where Collins was his\r\nschoolfellow--and both of the brothers at Oxford.  Joseph afterward\r\nbecame headmaster of Winchester, and lived till 1800, surviving his\r\nyounger brother ten years.  Thomas was always identified with Oxford,\r\nwhere he resided for forty-seven years.  He was appointed, in 1785,\r\nCamden Professor of History in the university, but gave no lectures.  In\r\nthe same year he was chosen to succeed Whitehead, as Poet Laureate.  Both\r\nbrothers were men of a genial, social temper.  Joseph was a man of some\r\nelegance; he was fond of the company of young ladies, went into general\r\nsociety, and had a certain renown as a drawing-room wit and diner-out.\r\nHe used to spend his Christmas vacations in London, where he was a member\r\nof Johnson's literary club.  Thomas, on the contrary, who waxed fat and\r\nindolent in college cloisters, until Johnson compared him to a turkey\r\ncock, was careless in his personal habits and averse to polite society.\r\nHe was the life of a common room at Oxford, romped with the schoolboys\r\nwhen he visited Dr. Warton at Winchester, and was said to have a\r\nhankering after pipes and ale and the broad mirth of the taproom.  Both\r\nWartons had an odd passion for military parades; and Thomas--who was a\r\nbeliever in ghosts--used secretly to attend hangings.  They were also\r\nremarkably harmonious in their tastes and intellectual pursuits, eager\r\nstudents of old English poetry, Gothic architecture, and British\r\nantiquities.  So far as enthusiasm, fine critical taste, and elegant\r\nscholarship can make men poets, the Wartons were poets.  But their work\r\nwas quite unoriginal.  Many of their poems can be taken to pieces and\r\nassigned, almost line by line and phrase by phrase, to Milton, Thomson,\r\nSpenser, Shakspere, Gray.  They had all of our romantic poet Longfellow's\r\ndangerous gifts of sympathy and receptivity, without a tenth part of his\r\ntechnical skill, or any of his real originality as an artist.  Like\r\nLongfellow, they loved the rich and mellow atmosphere of the historic\r\npast:\r\n\r\n    \"Tales that have the rime of age,\r\n    And chronicles of eld.\"\r\n\r\nThe closing lines of Thomas Warton's sonnet \"Written in a Blank Leaf of\r\nDugdale's Monasticon\"[8]--a favorite with Charles Lamb--might have been\r\nwritten by Longfellow:\r\n\r\n    \"Nor rough nor barren are the winding ways\r\n    Of hoar Antiquity, but strewn with flowers.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Warton's pretensions, as a poet, are much less than his younger\r\nbrother's.  Much of Thomas Warton's poetry, such as his _facetiae_ in the\r\n\"Oxford Sausage\" and his \"Triumph of Isis,\" had an academic flavor.\r\nThese we may pass over, as foreign to our present inquiries.  So, too,\r\nwith most of his annual laureate odes, \"On his Majesty's Birthday,\" etc.\r\nYet even these official and rather perfunctory performances testify to\r\nhis fondness for what Scott calls \"the memorials of our forefathers'\r\npiety or splendor.\"  Thus, in the birthday odes for 1787-88, and the New\r\nYear ode for 1787, he pays a tribute to the ancient minstrels and to\r\nearly laureates like Chaucer and Spenser, and celebrates \"the Druid harp\"\r\nsounding \"through the gloom profound of forests hoar\"; the fanes and\r\ncastles built by the Normans; and the\r\n\r\n    \"--bright hall where Odin's Gothic throne\r\n    With the broad blaze of brandished falchions shone.\"\r\n\r\nBut the most purely romantic of Thomas Warton's poems are \"The Crusade\"\r\nand \"The Grave of King Arthur.\"  The former is the song which\r\n\r\n    \"The lion heart Plantagenet\r\n    Sang, looking through his prison-bars,\"\r\n\r\nwhen the minstrel Blondel came wandering in search of his captive king.\r\nThe latter describes how Henry II., on his way to Ireland, was feasted at\r\nCilgarran Castle, where the Welsh bards sang to him of the death of\r\nArthur and his burial in Glastonbury Abbey.  The following passage\r\nanticipates Scott:\r\n\r\n    \"Illumining the vaulted roof,\r\n    A thousand torches flamed aloof;\r\n    From many cups, with golden gleam,\r\n    Sparkled the red metheglin's stream:\r\n    To grace the gorgeous festival,\r\n    Along the lofty-windowed hall\r\n    The storied tapestry was hung;\r\n    With minstrelsy the rafters rung\r\n    Of harps that with reflected light\r\n    From the proud gallery glittered bright:\r\n    While gifted bards, a rival throng,\r\n    From distant Mona, nurse of song,\r\n    From Teivi fringed with umbrage brown,\r\n    From Elvy's vale and Cader's crown,\r\n    From many a shaggy precipice\r\n    That shades Ierne's hoarse abyss,\r\n    And many a sunless solitude\r\n    Of Radnor's inmost mountains rude,\r\n    To crown the banquet's solemn close\r\n    Themes of British glory chose.\"\r\n\r\nHere is much of Scott's skill in the poetic manipulation of place-names,\r\n_e.g._,\r\n\r\n    \"Day set on Norham's castled steep,\r\n    And Tweed's fair river, broad and deep,\r\n    And Cheviot's mountains lone\"--\r\n\r\nnames which leave a far-resounding romantic rumble behind them.  Another\r\npassage in Warton's poem brings us a long way on toward Tennyson's \"Wild\r\nTintagel by the Cornish sea\" and his \"island valley of Avilion.\"\r\n\r\n    \"O'er Cornwall's cliffs the tempest roared:\r\n    High the screaming sea-mew soared:\r\n    In Tintaggel's topmost tower\r\n    Darkness fell the sleety shower:\r\n    Round the rough castle shrilly sung\r\n    The whirling blast, and wildly flung\r\n    On each tall rampart's thundering side\r\n    The surges of the tumbling tide,\r\n    When Arthur ranged his red-cross ranks\r\n    On conscious Camlan's crimsoned banks:\r\n    By Mordred's faithless guile decreed\r\n    Beneath a Saxon spear to bleed.\r\n    Yet in vain a Paynim foe\r\n    Armed with fate the mightly blow;\r\n    For when he fell, an elfin queen,\r\n    All in secret and unseen,\r\n    O'er the fainting hero threw\r\n    Her mantle of ambrosial blue,\r\n    And bade her spirits bear him far,\r\n    In Merlin's agate-axled car,\r\n    To her green isle's enameled steep\r\n    Far in the navel of the deep.\"\r\n\r\nOther poems of Thomas Warton touching upon his favorite studies are the\r\n\"Ode Sent to Mr. Upton, on his Edition of the Faery Queene,\" the \"Monody\r\nWritten near Stratford-upon-Avon,\" the sonnets, \"Written at Stonehenge,\"\r\n\"To Mr. Gray,\" and \"On King Arthur's Round Table,\" and the humorous\r\nepistle which he attributes to Thomas Hearne, the antiquary, denouncing\r\nthe bishops for their recent order that fast-prayers should be printed in\r\nmodern type instead of black letter, and pronouncing a curse upon the\r\nauthor of \"The Companion to the Oxford Guide Book\" for his disrespectful\r\nremarks about antiquaries.\r\n\r\n        \"May'st thou pore in vain\r\n    For dubious doorways!  May revengeful moths\r\n    Thy ledgers eat!  May chronologic spouts\r\n    Retain no cipher legible!  May crypts\r\n    Lurk undiscovered!  Nor may'st thou spell the names\r\n    Of saints in storied windows, nor the dates\r\n    Of bells discover, nor the genuine site\r\n    Of abbots' pantries!\"\r\n\r\nWarton was a classical scholar and, like most of the forerunners of the\r\nromantic school, was a trifle shame-faced over his Gothic heresies.  Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds had supplied a painted window of classical design for New\r\nCollege, Oxford; and Warton, in some complimentary verses, professes that\r\nthose \"portraitures of Attic art\" have won him back to the true taste;[9]\r\nand prophesies that henceforth angels, apostles, saints, miracles,\r\nmartyrdoms, and tales of legendary lore shall--\r\n\r\n    \"No more the sacred window's round disgrace,\r\n    But yield to Grecian groups the shining space. . .\r\n    Thy powerful hand has broke the Gothic chain,\r\n    And brought my bosom back to truth again. . .\r\n    For long, enamoured of a barbarous age,\r\n    A faithless truant to the classic page--\r\n    Long have I loved to catch the simple chime\r\n    Of minstrel harps, and spell the fabling rime;\r\n    To view the festive rites, the knightly play,\r\n    That decked heroic Albion's elder day;\r\n    To mark the mouldering halls of barons bold,\r\n    And the rough castle, cast in giant mould;\r\n    With Gothic manners, Gothic arts explore,\r\n    And muse on the magnificence of yore.\r\n    But chief, enraptured have I loved to roam,\r\n    A lingering votary, the vaulted dome,\r\n    Where the tall shafts, that mount in massy pride,\r\n    Their mingling branches shoot from side to side;\r\n    Where elfin sculptors, with fantastic clew,\r\n    O'er the long roof their wild embroidery drew;\r\n    Where Superstition, with capricious hand,\r\n    In many a maze, the wreathëd window planned,\r\n    With hues romantic tinged the gorgeous pane,\r\n    To fill with holy light the wondrous fane.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThe application of the word \"romantic,\" in this passage, to the mediaeval\r\nart of glass-staining is significant.  The revival of the art in our own\r\nday is due to the influence of the latest English school of romantic\r\npoetry and painting, and especially to William Morris.  Warton's\r\nbiographers track his passion for antiquity to the impression left upon\r\nhis mind by a visit to Windsor Castle, when he was a boy.  He used to\r\nspend his summers in wandering through abbeys and cathedrals.  He kept\r\nnotes of his observations and is known to have begun a work on Gothic\r\narchitecture, no trace of which, however, was found among his\r\nmanuscripts.  The Bodleian Library was one of his haunts, and he was\r\nfrequently seen \"surveying with quiet and rapt earnestness the ancient\r\ngateway of Magdalen College.\"  He delighted in illuminated manuscripts\r\nand black-letter folios.  In his \"Observations on the Faëry Queene\"[11]\r\nhe introduces a digression of twenty pages on Gothic architecture, and\r\nspeaks lovingly of a \"very curious and beautiful folio manuscript of the\r\nhistory of Arthur and his knights in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford,\r\nwritten on vellum, with illuminated initials and head-pieces, in which we\r\nsee the fashion of ancient armour, building, manner of tilting and other\r\nparticulars.\"\r\n\r\nAnother very characteristic poem of Warton's is the \"Ode Written at\r\nVale-Royal Abbey in Cheshire,\" a monastery of Cistercian monks, founded\r\nby Edward I.  This piece is saturated with romantic feeling and written\r\nin the stanza and manner of Gray's \"Elegy,\" as will appear from a pair of\r\nstanzas, taken at random:\r\n\r\n    \"By the slow clock, in stately-measured chime,\r\n    That from the messy tower tremendous tolled,\r\n    No more the plowman counts the tedious time,\r\n    Nor distant shepherd pens the twilight fold.\r\n\r\n    \"High o'er the trackless heath at midnight seen,\r\n    No more the windows, ranged in array\r\n    (Where the tall shaft and fretted nook between\r\n    Thick ivy twines), the tapered rites betray.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a note of Warton's period that, though Fancy and the Muse survey\r\nthe ruins of the abbey with pensive regret, \"severer Reason\"--the real\r\neighteenth-century divinity--\"scans the scene with philosophic ken,\"\r\nand--being a Protestant--reflects that, after all, the monastic houses\r\nwere \"Superstition's shrine\" and their demolition was a good thing for\r\nScience and Religion.\r\n\r\nThe greatest service, however, that Thomas Warton rendered to the studies\r\nthat he loved was his \"History of English Poetry from the Twelfth to the\r\nClose of the Sixteenth Century.\"  This was in three volumes, published\r\nrespectively in 1774, 1777, and 1781.  The fragment of a fourth volume\r\nwas issued in 1790.  A revised edition in four volumes was published in\r\n1824, under the editorship of Richard Price, corrected, augmented, and\r\nannotated by Ritson, Douce, Park, Ashby, and the editor himself.  In 1871\r\nappeared a new revision (also in four volumes) edited by W. Carew\r\nHazlitt, with many additions, by the editor and by well-known English\r\nscholars like Madden, Skeat, Furnivall, Morris, and Thomas and Aldis\r\nWright.  It should never be forgotten, in estimating the value of\r\nWarton's work, that he was a forerunner in this field.  Much of his\r\nlearning is out of date, and the modern editors of his history--Price and\r\nHazlitt--seem to the discouraged reader to be chiefly engaged, in their\r\nfootnotes and bracketed interpellations, in taking back statements that\r\nWarton had made in the text.  The leading position, _e.g._, of his\r\npreliminary dissertation, \"Of the Origin of Romantic Fiction in\r\nEurope\"--deriving it from the Spanish Arabs--has long since been\r\ndiscredited.  But Warton's learning was wide, if not exact; and it was\r\nnot dry learning, but quickened by the spirit of a genuine man of\r\nletters.  Therefore, in spite of its obsoleteness in matters of fact, his\r\nhistory remains readable, as a body of descriptive criticism, or a\r\ncontinuous literary essay. The best way to read it is to read it as it\r\nwas written--in the original edition--disregarding the apparatus of\r\nnotes, which modern scholars have accumulated about it, but remembering\r\nthat it is no longer an authority and probably needs correcting on every\r\npage.  Read thus, it is a thoroughly delightful book, \"a classic in its\r\nway,\" as Lowell has said.  Southey, too, affirmed that its publication\r\nformed an epoch in literary history; and that, with Percy's \"Reliques,\"\r\nit had promoted, beyond any other work, the \"growth of a better taste\r\nthan had prevailed for the hundred years preceding.\"\r\n\r\nGray had schemed a history of English poetry, but relinquished the design\r\nto Warton, to whom he communicated an outline of his own plan.  The\r\n\"Observations on English Metre\" and the essay on the poet Lydgate, among\r\nGray's prose remains, are apparently portions of this projected work.\r\n\r\nLowell, furthermore, pronounces Joseph Warton's \"Essay on the Genius and\r\nWritings of Pope\" (1756) \"the earliest public official declaration of war\r\nagainst the reigning mode.\"  The new school had its critics, as well as\r\nits poets, and the Wartons were more effective in the former capacity.\r\nThe war thus opened was by no means as internecine as that waged by the\r\nFrench classicists and romanticists of 1830.  It has never been possible\r\nto get up a very serious conflict in England, upon merely aesthetic\r\ngrounds.  Yet the same opposition existed.  Warton's biographer tells us\r\nthat the strictures made upon his essay were \"powerful enough to damp the\r\nardor of the essayist, who left his work in an imperfect state for the\r\nlong space of twenty-six years,\" _i.e._, till 1782, when he published the\r\nsecond volume.\r\n\r\nBoth Wartons were personal friends of Dr. Johnson; they were members of\r\nthe Literary Club and contributors to the _Idler_ and the _Adventurer_.\r\nThomas interested himself to get Johnson the Master's degree from Oxford,\r\nwhere the doctor made him a visit.  Some correspondence between them is\r\ngiven in Boswell.  Johnson maintained in public a respectful attitude\r\ntoward the critical and historical work of the Wartons; but he had no\r\nsympathy with their antiquarian enthusiasm or their liking for old\r\nEnglish poetry.  In private he ridiculed Thomas' verses, and summed them\r\nup in the manner ensuing:\r\n\r\n    \"Whereso'er I turn my view,\r\n    All is strange yet nothing new;\r\n    Endless labor all along,\r\n    Endless labor to be wrong;\r\n    Phrase that time has flung away,\r\n    Uncouth words in disarray,\r\n    Tricked in antique ruff and bonnet,\r\n    Ode and elegy and sonnet.\"\r\n\r\nAnd although he added, \"Remember that I love the fellow dearly, for all I\r\nlaugh at him,\" this saving clause failed to soothe the poet's indignant\r\nbreast, when he heard that the doctor had ridiculed his lines.  An\r\nestrangement resulted which Johnson is said to have spoken of even with\r\ntears, saying \"that Tom Warton was the only man of genius he ever knew\r\nwho wanted a heart.\"\r\n\r\nGoldsmith, too, belonged to the conservative party, though Mr. Perry[12]\r\ndetects romantic touches in \"The Deserted Village,\" such as the line,\r\n\r\n    \"Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe,\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    \"On Torno's cliffs or Pambamarca's side.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning\" (1759)\r\nGoldsmith pronounces the age one of literary decay; he deplores the vogue\r\nof blank verse--which he calls an \"erroneous innovation\"--and the\r\n\"disgusting solemnity of manner\" that it has brought into fashion.  He\r\ncomplains of the revival of old plays upon the stage.  \"Old pieces are\r\nrevived, and scarcely any new ones admitted. . .  The public are again\r\nobliged to ruminate over those ashes of absurdity which were disgusting\r\nto our ancestors even in an age of ignorance. . .  What must be done?\r\nOnly sit down contented, cry up all that comes before us and advance even\r\nthe absurdities of Shakspere.  Let the reader suspend his censure; I\r\nadmire the beauties of this great father of our stage as much as they\r\ndeserve, but could wish, for the honor of our country, and for his own\r\ntoo, that many of his scenes were forgotten.  A man blind of one eye\r\nshould always be painted in profile.  Let the spectator who assists at\r\nany of these new revived pieces only ask himself whether he would approve\r\nsuch a performance, if written by a modern poet.  I fear he will find\r\nthat much of his applause proceeds merely from the sound of a name and an\r\nempty veneration for antiquity.  In fact, the revival of those _pieces of\r\nforced humor, far-fetched conceit and unnatural hyperbole which have been\r\nascribed to Shakspere_, is rather gibbeting than raising a statue to his\r\nmemory.\"\r\n\r\nThe words that I have italicized make it evident that what Goldsmith was\r\nreally finding fault with was the restoration of the original text of\r\nShakspere's plays, in place of the garbled versions that had hitherto\r\nbeen acted.  This restoration was largely due to Garrick, but Goldsmith's\r\nlanguage implies that the reform was demanded by public opinion and by\r\nthe increasing \"veneration for antiquity.\"  The next passage shows that\r\nthe new school had its _claque_, which rallied to the support of the old\r\nBritish drama as the French romanticists did, nearly a century later, to\r\nthe support of Victor Hugo's _melodrames_.[13]\r\n\r\n\"What strange vamped comedies, farcical tragedies, or what shall I call\r\nthem--speaking pantomimes have we not of late seen?. . .  The piece\r\npleases our critics because it talks Old English; and it pleases the\r\ngalleries because it has ribaldry. . .  A prologue generally precedes the\r\npiece, to inform us that it was composed by Shakspere or old Ben, or\r\nsomebody else who took them for his model.  A face of iron could not have\r\nthe assurance to avow dislike; the theater has its partisans who\r\nunderstand the force of combinations trained up to vociferation, clapping\r\nof hands and clattering of sticks; and though a man might have strength\r\nsufficient to overcome a lion in single combat, he may run the risk of\r\nbeing devoured by an army of ants.\"\r\n\r\nGoldsmith returned to the charge in \"The Vicar of Wakefield\" (1766),\r\nwhere Dr. Primrose, inquiring of the two London dames, \"who were the\r\npresent theatrical writers in vogue, who were the Drydens and Otways of\r\nthe day,\" is surprised to learn that Dryden and Rowe are quite out of\r\nfashion, that taste has gone back a whole century, and that \"Fletcher,\r\nBen Jonson and all the plays of Shakspere are the only things that go\r\ndown.\"  \"How,\" cries the good vicar, \"is it possible the present age can\r\nbe pleased with that antiquated dialect, that obsolete humor, those\r\novercharged characters which abound in the works you mention?\"\r\nGoldsmith's disgust with this affectation finds further vent in his \"Life\r\nof Parnell\" (1770).  \"He [Parnell] appears to me to be the last of that\r\ngreat school that had modeled itself upon the ancients, and taught\r\nEnglish poetry to resemble what the generality of mankind have allowed to\r\nexcel. . .  His productions bear no resemblance to those tawdry things\r\nwhich it has, for some time, been the fashion to admire. . .  His\r\npoetical language is not less correct than his subjects are pleasing.  He\r\nfound it at that period in which it was brought to its highest pitch of\r\nrefinement; and ever since his time, it has been gradually debasing.  It\r\nis, indeed, amazing, after what has been done by Dryden, Addison, and\r\nPope, to improve and harmonize our native tongue, that their successors\r\nshould have taken so much pains to involve it into pristine barbarity.\r\nThese misguided innovators have not been content with restoring\r\nantiquated words and phrases, but have indulged themselves in the most\r\nlicentious transpositions and the harshest constructions; vainly\r\nimagining that, the more their writings are unlike prose, the more they\r\nresemble poetry.  They have adopted a language of their own, and call\r\nupon mankind for admiration.  All those who do not understand them are\r\nsilent; and those who make out their meaning are willing to praise, to\r\nshow they understand.\"  This last sentence is a hit at the alleged\r\nobscurity of Gray's and Mason's odes.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the growth of a retrospective habit in literature Mr.\r\nPerry[14] quotes at length from an essay \"On the Prevailing Taste for the\r\nOld English Poets,\" by Vicesimus Knox, sometimes master of Tunbridge\r\nschool, editor of \"Elegant Extracts\" and honorary doctor of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.  Knox's essays were written while he was an\r\nOxford undergraduate, and published collectively in 1777.  By this time\r\nthe romantic movement was in full swing.  \"The Castle of Otranto\" and\r\nPercy's \"Reliques\" had been out more than ten years; many of the Rowley\r\npoems were in print; and in this very year, Tyrwhitt issued a complete\r\nedition of them, and Warton published the second volume of his \"History\r\nof English Poetry.\"  Chatterton and Percy are both mentioned by Knox.\r\n\r\n\"The antiquarian spirit,\" he writes, \"which was once confined to\r\ninquiries concerning the manners, the buildings, the records, and the\r\ncoins of the ages that preceded us, has now extended itself to those\r\npoetical compositions which were popular among our forefathers, but which\r\nhave gradually sunk into oblivion through the decay of language and the\r\nprevalence of a correct and polished taste.  Books printed in the black\r\nletter are sought for with the same avidity with which the English\r\nantiquary peruses a monumental inscription, or treasures up a Saxon piece\r\nof money.  The popular ballad, composed by some illiterate minstrel, and\r\nwhich has been handed down by tradition for several centuries, is rescued\r\nfrom the hands of the vulgar, to obtain a place in the collection of the\r\nman of taste.  Verses which, a few years past, were thought worthy the\r\nattention of children only, or of the lowest and rudest orders, are now\r\nadmired for that artless simplicity which once obtained the name of\r\ncoarseness and vulgarity.\"  Early English poetry, continues the essayist,\r\n\"has had its day, and the antiquary must not despise us if we cannot\r\nperuse it with patience.  He who delights in all such reading as is never\r\nread, may derive some pleasure from the singularity of his taste, but he\r\nought still to respect the judgment of mankind, which has consigned to\r\noblivion the works which he admires.  While he pores unmolested on\r\nChaucer, Gower, Lydgate, and Occleve, let him not censure our obstinacy\r\nin adhering to Homer, Virgil, Milton, and Pope. . .  Notwithstanding the\r\nincontrovertible merit of many of our ancient relics of poetry, I believe\r\nit may be doubted whether any one of them would be tolerated as the\r\nproduction of a modern poet.  As a good imitation of the ancient manner,\r\nit would find its admirers; but, considered independently, as an\r\noriginal, it would be thought a careless, vulgar, inartificial\r\ncomposition.  There are few who do not read Dr. Percy's own pieces, and\r\nthose of other late writers, with more pleasure than the oldest ballad in\r\nthe collection of that ingenious writer.\"  Mr. Percy quotes another paper\r\nof Knox in which he divides the admirers of English poetry into two\r\nparties: \"On one side are the lovers and imitators of Spenser and Milton;\r\nand on the other, those of Dryden, Boileau, and Pope\"; in modern phrase,\r\nthe romanticists and the classicists.\r\n\r\nJoseph Warton's \"Essay on Pope\" was an attempt to fix its subject's rank\r\namong English poets.  Following the discursive method of Thomas Warton's\r\n\"Observations on the Faerie Queen,\" it was likewise an elaborate\r\ncommentary on all of Pope's poems _seriatim_.  Every point was\r\nillustrated with abundant learning, and there were digressions amounting\r\nto independent essays on collateral topics: one, _e.g._, on Chaucer, one\r\non early French Metrical romances; another on Gothic architecture:\r\nanother on the new school of landscape gardening, in which Walpole's\r\nessay and Mason's poem are quoted with approval, and mention is made of\r\nthe Leasowes.  The book was dedicated to Young; and when the second\r\nvolume was published in 1782, the first was reissued in a revised form\r\nand introduced by a letter to the author from Tyrwhitt, who writes that,\r\nunder the shelter of Warton's authority, \"one may perhaps venture to avow\r\nan opinion that poetry is not confined to rhyming couplets, and that its\r\ngreatest powers are not displayed in prologues and epilogues.\"\r\n\r\nThe modern reader will be apt to think Warton's estimate of Pope quite\r\nhigh enough.  He places him, to be sure, in the second rank of poets,\r\nbelow Spenser, Shakspere, and Milton, yet next to Milton and above\r\nDryden; and he calls the reign of Queen Anne the great age of English\r\npoetry.  Yet if it be recollected that the essay was published only\r\ntwelve years after Pope's death, and at a time when he was still commonly\r\nheld to be, if not the greatest poet, at least the greatest artist in\r\nverse, that England had ever produced, it will be seen that Warton's\r\nopinions might well be thought revolutionary, and his challenge to the\r\ncritics a bold one.  These opinions can be best exhibited by quoting a\r\nfew passages from his book, not consecutive, but taken here and there as\r\nbest suits the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The sublime and the pathetic are the two chief nerves of all genuine\r\npoesy.  What is there transcendently sublime or pathetic in Pope?. . .\r\nHe early left the more poetical provinces of his art, to become a moral,\r\ndidactic, and satiric poet. . .  And because I am, perhaps, unwilling to\r\nspeak out in plain English, I will adopt the following passage of\r\nVoltaire, which, in my opinion, as exactly characteristizes Pope as it\r\ndoes his model, Boileau, for whom it was originally designed.  'Incapable\r\npeut-être du sublime qui élève l'áme, et du sentiment qui l'attendrit,\r\nmais fait pour éclairer ceux à qui la nature accorda l'un et l'autre;\r\nlaborieux, sévère, précis, pur, harmonieux, il devint enfin le poëte de\r\nla Raison.'. . .  A clear head and acute understanding are not sufficient\r\nalone to make a poet; the most solid observations on human life,\r\nexpressed with the utmost elegance and brevity, are morality and not\r\npoetry. . .  It is a creative and glowing imagination, _acer spiritus ac\r\nvis_, and that alone, that can stamp a writer with this exalted and very\r\nuncommon character.\"\r\n\r\nWarton believes that Pope's projected epic on Brutus, the legendary found\r\nof Britain, \"would have more resembled the 'Henriade' than the 'Iliad,'\r\nor even the 'Gierusalemme Liberata'; that it would have appeared (if this\r\nscheme had been executed) how much, and for what reasons, the man that is\r\nskillful in painting modern life, and the most secret foibles and follies\r\nof his contemporaries, is, THEREFORE, disqualified for representing the\r\nages of heroism, and that simple life which alone epic poetry can\r\ngracefully describe. . .  Wit and satire are transitory and perishable,\r\nbut nature and passion are eternal.\"  The largest portion of Pope's work,\r\nsays the author's closing summary, \"is of the didactic, moral, and\r\nsatiric kind; and consequently not of the most poetic species of poetry;\r\nwhen it is manifest that good sense and judgment were his\r\ncharacteristical excellencies, rather than fancy and invention. . .  He\r\nstuck to describing modern manners; but those manners, because they are\r\nfamiliar, uniform, artificial, and polished, are in their very nature,\r\nunfit for any lofty effort of the Muse.  He gradually became one of the\r\nmost correct, even, and exact poets that ever wrote. . .  Whatever\r\npoetical enthusiasm he actually possessed, he withheld and stifled.  The\r\nperusal of him affects not our minds with such strong emotions as we feel\r\nfrom Homer and Milton; so that no man of a true poetical spirit is master\r\nof himself while he reads them. . .  He who would think the 'Faerie\r\nQueene,' 'Palamon and Arcite,' the 'Tempest' or 'Comus,' childish and\r\nromantic might relish Pope.  Surely it is no narrow and niggardly\r\nencomium to say, he is the great poet of Reason, the first of ethical\r\nauthors in verse.\"\r\n\r\nTo illustrate Pope's inferiority in the poetry of nature and passion,\r\nWarton quotes freely by way of contrast, not only from Spenser and\r\nMilton, but from such contemporaries of his own as Thomson, Akenside,\r\nGray, Collins, Dyer, Mason, West, Shenstone, and Bedingfield.  He\r\ncomplains that Pope's \"Pastorals\" contains no new image of nature, and\r\nhis \"Windsor Forest\" no local color; while \"the scenes of Thomson are\r\nfrequently as wild and romantic as those of Salvator Rosa, varied with\r\nprecipices and torrents and 'castled cliffs' and deep valleys, with piny\r\nmountains and the gloomiest caverns.\"  \"When Gray published his exquisite\r\node on Eton College . . . little notice was taken of it; but I suppose no\r\ncritic can be found that will not place it far above Pope's 'Pastorals.'\"\r\n\r\nA few additional passages will serve to show that this critic's literary\r\nprinciples, in general, were consciously and polemically romantic.  Thus\r\nhe pleads for the _mot précis_--that shibboleth of the nineteenth-century\r\nromanticists--for \"_natural, little_ circumstances\" against \"those who\r\nare fond of _generalities_\"; for the \"lively painting of Spenser and\r\nShakspere,\" as contrasted with the lack of picturesqueness and imagery in\r\nVoltaire's \"Henriade.\"  He praises \"the fashion that has lately obtained,\r\nin all the nations of Europe, of republishing and illustrating their old\r\npoets.\"[15]  Again, commenting upon Pope's well-known triplet,\r\n\r\n    \"Waller was smooth, but Dryden taught to join\r\n    The varying verse, the full-resounding line,\r\n    The long majestic march and energy divine!\"\r\n\r\nhe exclaims: \"What!  Did Milton contribute nothing to the harmony and\r\nextent of our language?. . .  Surely his verses vary and resound as much,\r\nand display as much majesty and energy, as any that can be found in\r\nDryden.  And we will venture to say that he that studies Milton\r\nattentively, will gain a truer taste for genuine poetry than he that\r\nforms himself on French writers and their followers.\"  Elsewhere he\r\nexpresses a preference for blank verse over rhyme, in long poems on\r\nsubjects of a dignified kind.[16]\r\n\r\n\"It is perpetually the nauseous cant of the French critics, and of their\r\nadvocates and pupils, that the English writers are generally incorrect.\r\nIf correctness implies an absence of petty faults, this perhaps may be\r\ngranted; if it means that, because their tragedians have avoided the\r\nirregularities of Shakspere, and have observed a juster economy in their\r\nfables, therefore the 'Athalia,' for instance, is preferable to 'Lear,'\r\nthe notion is groundless and absurd.  Though the 'Henriade' should be\r\nallowed to be free from any very gross absurdities, yet who will dare to\r\nrank it with the 'Paradise Lost'?. . .  In our own country the rules of\r\nthe drama were never more completely understood than at present; yet what\r\nuninteresting, though faultless, tragedies have we lately seen!. . .\r\nWhether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated by that\r\ntimidity and caution which is occasioned by a rigid regard to the\r\ndictates of art; or whether that philosophical, that geometrical and\r\nsystematical spirit so much in vogue, which has spread itself from the\r\nsciences even into polite literature, by consulting only reason, has not\r\ndiminished and destroyed sentiment, and made our poets write from and to\r\nthe head rather than the heart; or whether, lastly, when just models,\r\nfrom which the rules have necessarily been drawn, have once appeared,\r\nsucceeding writers, by vainly and ambitiously striving to surpass\r\nthose . . . do not become stiff and forced.\"  One of these uninteresting,\r\nthough faultless tragedies was \"Cato,\" which Warton pronounces a\r\n\"sententious and declamatory drama\" filled with \"pompous Roman\r\nsentiments,\" but wanting action and pathos.  He censures the tameness of\r\nAddison's \"Letter from Italy.\"[17]  \"With what flatness and unfeelingness\r\nhas he spoken of statuary and painting!  Raphael never received a more\r\nphlegmatic eulogy.\"  He refers on the other hand to Gray's account of his\r\njourney to the Grande Chartreuse,[18] as worthy of comparison with one of\r\nthe finest passages in the \"Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard.\"\r\n\r\nThis mention of Addison recalls a very instructive letter of Gray on the\r\nsubject of poetic style.[19]  The romanticists loved a rich diction, and\r\nthe passage might be taken as an anticipatory defense of himself against\r\nWordsworth's strictures in the preface to the \"Lyrical Ballads.\"  \"The\r\nlanguage of the age,\" wrote Gray, \"is never the language of poetry,\r\nexcept among the French, whose verse . . . differs in nothing from prose.\r\nOur poetry has a language peculiar to itself; to which almost everyone\r\nthat has written has added something, by enriching it with foreign idioms\r\nand derivatives; nay, sometimes words of their own composition or\r\ninvention.  Shakspere and Milton have been great creators in this\r\nway . . . our language has an undoubted right to words of an hundred\r\nyears old, provided antiquity have not rendered them unintelligible.  In\r\ntruth Shakspere's language is one of his principal beauties; and he has\r\nno less advantage over your Addisons and Rowes in this, than in those\r\nother great excellencies you mention.  Every word in him is a picture.\"\r\nHe then quotes a passage from \"Richard III.,\" and continues, \"Pray put me\r\nthe following lines into the tongue of our modern dramatics.  To me they\r\nappear untranslatable, and if this be the case, our language is greatly\r\ndegenerated.\"\r\n\r\nWarton further protests against the view which ascribed the introduction\r\nof true taste in literature to the French.  \"Shakspere and Milton\r\nimitated the Italians and not the French.\"  He recommends also the\r\nreintroduction of the preternatural into poetry.  There are some, he\r\nsays, who think that poetry has suffered by becoming too rational,\r\ndeserting fairyland, and laying aside \"descriptions of magic and\r\nenchantment,\" and he quotes, _à propos_ of this the famous stanza about\r\nthe Hebrides in \"The Castle of Indolence.\"[20]  The false refinement of\r\nthe French has made them incapable of enjoying \"the terrible graces of\r\nour irregular Shakspere, especially in his scenes of magic and\r\nincantations.  These _Gothic_ charms are in truth more striking to the\r\nimagination than the classical.  The magicians of Ariosto, Tasso, and\r\nSpenser have more powerful spells than those of Apollonius, Seneca, and\r\nLucan.  The enchanted forest of Ismeni is more awfully and tremendously\r\npoetical than even the grove which Caesar orders to be cut down in Lucan\r\n(i. iii. 400), which was so full of terrors that, at noonday or midnight,\r\nthe priest himself dared not approach it--\r\n\r\n    \"'Dreading the demon of the grove to meet.'\r\n\r\n\"Who that sees the sable plumes waving on the prodigious helmet in the\r\nCastle of Otranto, and the gigantic arm on the top of the great\r\nstaircase, is not more affected than with the paintings of Ovid and\r\nApuleius?  What a group of dreadful images do we meet with in the Edda!\r\nThe Runic poetry abounds in them.  Such is Gray's thrilling Ode on the\r\n'Descent of Odin.'\"\r\n\r\nWarton predicts that Pope's fame as a poet will ultimately rest on his\r\n\"Windsor Forest,\" his \"Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard,\" and \"The Rape of\r\nthe Lock.\"  To this prophecy time has already, in part, given the lie.\r\nWarton preferred \"Windsor Forest\" and \"Eloisa\" to the \"Moral Essays\"\r\nbecause they belonged to a higher kind of poetry.  Posterity likes the\r\n\"Moral Essays\" better because they are better of their kind.  They were\r\nthe natural fruit of Pope's genius and of his time, while the others were\r\nartificial.  We can go to Wordsworth for nature, to Byron for passion,\r\nand to a score of poets for both, but Pope remains unrivaled in his\r\npeculiar field.  In other words, we value what is characteristic in the\r\nartist; the one thing which he does best, the precise thing which he can\r\ndo and no one else can.  But Warton's mistake is significant of the\r\nchanging literary standards of his age; and his essay is one proof out of\r\nmany that the English romantic movement was not entirely without\r\nself-conscious aims, but had its critical formulas and its programme,\r\njust as Queen Anne classicism had.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Dr. Johnson had his laugh at this popular person:\r\n\r\n    \"'Hermit hoar, in solemn cell\r\n    Wearing out life's evening gray,\r\n    Strike thy bosom, sage, and tell\r\n    What is bliss, and which the way?'\r\n\r\n    \"Thus I spoke, and speaking sighed,\r\n    Scarce suppressed the starting tear:\r\n    When the hoary sage replied,\r\n    '_Come, my lad, and drink some beer._'\"\r\n\r\n[2] \"Grose's Antiquities of Scotland\" was published in 1791, and Burns\r\nwrote \"Tam o'Shanter\" to accompany the picture of Kirk Alloway in this\r\nwork.  See his poem, \"On the late Captain Grose's Peregrinations through\r\nScotland.\"\r\n\r\n[3] \"Ragnarök,\" or \"Götterdämmerung,\" the twilight of the Gods\r\n\r\n[4] For a full discussion of Gray's sources and of his knowledge of Old\r\nNorse, the reader should consult the appendix by Professor G. L.\r\nKittredge to Professor W. L. Phelps' \"Selections from Gray\" (1894, pp.\r\nxl-1.)  Professor Kittredge concludes that Gray had but a slight\r\nknowledge of Norse, that he followed the Latin of Bartholin in his\r\nrenderings; and that he probably also made use of such authorities as\r\nTorfaeus' \"Orcades\" (1697), Ole Worm's \"Literatura Runica\" (Copenhagen,\r\n1636), Dr. George Hickes' monumental \"Thesaurus\" (Oxford, 1705), and\r\nRobert Sheringham's \"De Anglorum Gentis Origine Disceptatio\" (1716).\r\nDryden's \"Miscellany Poems\" (1716) has a verse translation, \"The Waking\r\nof Angantyr,\" from the English prose of Hickes, of a portion of the\r\n\"Hervarar Saga.\"  Professor Kittredge refers to Sir William Temple's\r\nessays \"Of Poetry\" and \"Of Heroic Virtue.\"  \"Nichols' Anecdotes\" (I. 116)\r\nmentions, as published in 1715, \"The Rudiments of Grammar for the English\r\nSaxon Tongue; with an Apology for the study of Northern Antiquities.\"\r\nThis was by Mrs. Elizabeth Elstob, and was addressed to Hickes, the\r\ncompiler of the \"Thesaurus.\"\r\n\r\n[5] \"Some Specimens of the Poetry of the Ancient Welsh Bards, translated\r\ninto English,\" by  Rev. Evan Evans, 1764.  The specimens were ten in\r\nnumber.  The translations were in English prose.  The originals were\r\nprinted from a copy which Davies, the author of the Welsh dictionary, had\r\nmade of an ancient vellum MS. thought to be of the time of Edward II,\r\nEdward III, and Henry V.  The book included a Latin \"Dissertatio de\r\nBardis,\" together with notes, appendices, etc.  The preface makes mention\r\nof Macpherson's recently published Ossianic poems.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Life of Gray.\"\r\n\r\n[7] See Phelps' \"English Romantic Movement,\" pp. 73, 141-42.\r\n\r\n[8] Wm Dugdale published his \"Monasticon Anglicanum,\" a history of English\r\nreligious houses, in three parts, in 1655-62-73.  It was accompanied with\r\nillustrations of the costumes worn by the ancient religious orders, and\r\nwith architectural views.  The latter, says Eastlake, were rude and\r\nunsatisfactory, but interesting to modern students, as \"preserving\r\nrepresentations of buildings, or portions of buildings, no longer in\r\nexistence; as, for instance, the _campanile_, or detached belfry of\r\nSalisbury, since removed, and the spire of Lincoln, destroyed in 1547.\"\r\n\r\n[9] \"Verses on Sir Joshua Reynolds' Painted Window.\"  _Cf._ Poe, \"To\r\nHelen\":\r\n\r\n    \"On desperate seas long wont to roam\r\n    Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,\r\n    Thy Naiad airs have brought me home\r\n    To the glory that was Greece,\r\n    And the grandeur that was Rome.\"\r\n\r\n[10] This apology should be compared with Scott's verse epistle to Wm\r\nEreskine, prefixed to the third canto of \"Marmion.\"\r\n\r\n        \"For me, thus nurtured, dost thou ask\r\n    The classic poet's well-conned task?\" etc.\r\n\r\nScott spoke of himself in Warton's exact language, as a \"truant to the\r\nclassic page.\"\r\n\r\n[11] See _ante_, pp. 99-101_._\r\n\r\n[12] \"Eighteenth Century Literature,\" p. 397.\r\n\r\n[13] Lowell mentions the publication of Dodsley's \"Old Plays,\" (1744) as,\r\nlike Percy's \"Reliques,\" a symptom of the return of the past.

Hurd was a\r\nfriend of Gray and Mason, and his \"Letters on Chivalry and Romance\"\r\n(1762) helped to initiate the romantic movement.  They perhaps owed their\r\ninspiration, in part, to Sainte Palaye's \"Mémoires sur l'ancienne\r\nChevalerie,\" the first volume of which was issued in 1759, though the\r\nthird and concluding volume appeared only in 1781.  This was a monumental\r\nwork and, as a standard authority, bears much the same relation to the\r\nliterature of its subject that Mallet's \"Histoire de Dannemarc\" bears to\r\nall the writing on Runic mythology that was done in Europe during the\r\neighteenth-century.  Jean Baptiste de la Curne de Sainte Palaye was a\r\nscholar of wide learning, not only in the history of mediaeval\r\ninstitutions but in old French dialects.  He went to the south of France\r\nto familiarize himself with Provençal: collected a large library of\r\nProvençal books and manuscripts, and published in 1774 his \"Histoire de\r\nTroubadours.\"  Among his other works are a \"Dictionary of French\r\nAntiquities,\" a glossary of Old French, and an edition of \"Aucassin et\r\nNicolete.\"  Mrs. Susannah Dobson, who wrote \"Historical Anecdotes of\r\nHeraldry and Chivalry\" (1795), made an English translation of Sainte\r\nPalaye's \"History of the Troubadours\" in 1779, and of his \"Memoirs of\r\nAncient Chivalry\" in 1784.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Hurd's letters was to prove \"the pre-eminence of the\r\nGothic manners and fictions, as adapted to the ends of poetry, above the\r\nclassic.\"  \"The greatest geniuses of our own and foreign countries,\" he\r\naffirms, \"such as Ariosto and Tasso in Italy, and Spenser and Milton in\r\nEngland, were seduced by these barbarities of their forefathers; were\r\neven charmed by the Gothic romances.  Was this caprice and absurdity in\r\nthem?  Or may there not be something in the Gothic Romance peculiarly\r\nsuited to the view of a genius and to the ends of poetry?  And may not\r\nthe philosophic moderns have gone too far in their perpetual ridicule and\r\ncontempt of it?\"  After a preliminary discussion of the origin of\r\nchivalry and knight-errantry and of the ideal knightly characteristics,\r\n\"Prowess, Generosity, Gallantry, and Religion,\" which he derives from the\r\nmilitary necessities of the feudal system, he proceeds to establish a\r\n\"remarkable correspondency between the manners of the old heroic times,\r\nas painted by their romancer, Homer, and those which are represented to\r\nus in the books of modern knight-errantry.\"  He compares, _e.g._, the\r\nLaestrygonians, Cyclopes_, _Circes, and Calypsos of Homer, with the\r\ngiants, paynims, sorceresses encountered by the champions of romance; the\r\nGreek aoixoi with the minstrels; the Olympian games with tournaments; and\r\nthe exploits of Hercules and Theseus, in quelling dragons and other\r\nmonsters, with the similar enterprises of Lancelot and Amadis de Gaul.\r\nThe critic is daring enough to give the Gothic manners the preference\r\nover the heroic.  Homer, he says, if he could have known both, would have\r\nchosen the former by reason of \"the improved gallantry of the feudal\r\ntimes, and the superior solemnity of their superstitions.  The gallantry\r\nwhich inspirited the feudal times was of a nature to furnish the poet\r\nwith finer scenes and subjects of description, in every view, than the\r\nsimple and uncontrolled barbarity of the Grecian. . .  There was a\r\ndignity, a magnificence, a variety in the feudal, which the other wanted.\"\r\n\r\nAn equal advantage, thinks Hurd, the romancers enjoyed over the pagan\r\npoets in the point of supernatural machinery.  \"For the more solemn\r\nfancies of witchcraft and incantation, the horrors of the Gothic were\r\nabove measure striking and terrible.  The mummeries of the pagan priests\r\nwere childish, but the Gothic enchanters shook and alarmed all\r\nnature. . .  You would not compare the Canidia of Horace with the witches\r\nin 'Macbeth.'  And what are Virgil's myrtles, dropping blood, to Tasso's\r\nenchanted forest?. . .  The fancies of our modern bards are not only more\r\ngallant, but . . . more sublime, more terrible, more alarming than those\r\nof the classic fables.  In a word, you will find that the manners they\r\npaint, and the superstitions they adopt, are the more poetical for being\r\nGothic.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently the despised \"Gothick\" of Addison--as Mr. Howells puts it--was\r\nfast becoming the admired \"Gothic\" of Scott.  This pronunciamento of very\r\nadvanced romantic doctrine came out several years before Percy's\r\n\"Reliques\" and \"The Castle of Otranto.\"  It was only a few years later\r\nthan Thomas Warton's \"Observations on the Faërie Queene\" and Joseph's\r\n\"Essay on Pope,\" but its views were much more radical.  Neither of the\r\nWartons would have ventured to pronounce the Gothic manners superior to\r\nthe Homeric, as materials for poetry, whatever, in his secret heart, he\r\nmight have thought.[1]  To Johnson such an opinion must have seemed flat\r\nblasphemy.  Hurd accounts for the contempt into which the Gothic had\r\nfallen on the ground that the feudal ages had never had the good fortune\r\nto possess a great poet, like Homer, capable of giving adequate artistic\r\nexpression to their life and ideals.  _Carent vate sacro_.  Spenser and\r\nTasso, he thinks, \"came too late, and it was impossible for them to paint\r\ntruly and perfectly what was no longer seen or believed. . .  As it is,\r\nwe may take a guess of what the subject was capable of affording to real\r\ngenius from the rude sketches we have of it in the old romancers. . .\r\nThe ablest writers of Greece ennobled the system of heroic manners, while\r\nit was fresh and flourishing; and their works being masterpieces of\r\ncomposition, so fixed the credit of it in the opinion of the world, that\r\nno revolution of time and taste could afterward shake it.  Whereas the\r\nGothic, having been disgraced in their infancy by bad writers, and a new\r\nset of manners springing up before there were any better to do them\r\njustice, they could never be brought into vogue by the attempts of later\r\npoets.\"  Moreover, \"the Gothic manners of chivalry, as springing out of\r\nthe feudal system, were as singular as that system itself; so that when\r\nthat political constitution vanished out of Europe, the manners that\r\nbelonged to it were no longer seen or understood.  There was no example\r\nof any such manners remaining on the face of the earth.  And as they\r\nnever did subsist but once, and are never likely to subsist again, people\r\nwould be led of course to think and speak of them as romantic and\r\nunnatural.\"\r\n\r\nEven so, he thinks that the Renaissance poets, Ariosto and Spenser, owe\r\ntheir finest effects not to their tinge of classical culture but to their\r\nromantic materials.  Shakspere \"is greater when he uses Gothic manners\r\nand machinery, than when he employs classical.\"  Tasso, to be sure, tried\r\nto trim between the two, by giving an epic form to his romantic\r\nsubject-matter, but Hurd pronounces his imitations of the ancients \"faint\r\nand cold and almost insipid, when compared with his original\r\nfictions. . .  If it was not for these _lies_ [_magnanima mensogna_] of\r\nGothic invention, I should scarcely be disposed to give the 'Gierusalemme\r\nLiberata' a second reading.\"  Nay, Milton himself, though finally\r\nchoosing the classic model, did so only after long hesitation.  \"His\r\nfavorite subject was Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  On this\r\nhe had fixed for the greater part of his life.  What led him to change\r\nhis mind was partly, as I suppose, his growing fanaticism; partly his\r\nambition to take a different route from Spenser; but chiefly, perhaps,\r\nthe discredit into which the stories of chivalry had now fallen by the\r\nimmortal satire of Cervantes.  Yet we see through all his poetry, where\r\nhis enthusiasm flames out most, a certain predilection for the legends of\r\nchivalry before the fables of Greece.\"  Hurd says that, if the \"Faërie\r\nQueene\" be regarded as a Gothic poem, it will be seen to have unity of\r\ndesign, a merit which even the Wartons had denied it.  \"When an architect\r\nexamines a Gothic structure by the Grecian rules he finds nothing but\r\ndeformity.  But the Gothic architecture has its own rules by which; when\r\nit comes to be examined, it is seen to have its merit, as well as the\r\nGrecian.\"\r\n\r\nThe essayist complains that the Gothic fables fell into contempt through\r\nthe influence of French critics who ridiculed and disparaged the Italian\r\nromancers, Ariosto and Tasso.  The English critics of the\r\nRestoration--Davenant, Hobbes, Shaftesbury--took their cue from the\r\nFrench, till these pseudo-classical principles \"grew into a sort of a\r\ncant, with which Rymer and the rest of that school filled their flimsy\r\nessays and rumbling prefaces. . .  The exact but cold Boileau happened to\r\nsay something about the _clinquant_ of Tasso,\" and \"Mr. Addison,[2] who\r\ngave the law in taste here, took it up and sent it about,\" so that \"it\r\nbecame a sort of watchword among the critics.\"  \"What we have gotten,\"\r\nconcludes the final letter of the series, \"by this revolution, is a great\r\ndeal of good sense.  What we have lost is a world of fine fabling, the\r\nillusion of which is so grateful to the _charméd spirit_ that, in spite\r\nof philosophy and fashion 'Faery' Spenser still ranks highest among the\r\npoets; I mean with all those who are earlier come of that house, or have\r\nany kindness for it.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, during the classical period, \"Gothic,\" as a term in\r\nliterary criticism, was synonymous with barbarous, lawless, and tawdry.\r\nAddison instructs his public that \"the taste of most of our English\r\npoets, as well as readers, is extremely Gothic.\"[3]  After commending the\r\nFrench critics, Bouhours and Boileau, for their insistence upon good\r\nsense, justness of thought, simplicity, and naturalness he goes on as\r\nfollows: \"Poets who want this strength of genius, to give that majestic\r\nsimplicity to nature which we so much admire in the works of the\r\nancients, are forced to hunt after foreign ornaments, and not to let any\r\npiece of wit, of what kind soever, escape them.  I look upon these\r\nwriters as Goths in poetry, who, like those in architecture, not being\r\nable to come up to the beautiful simplicity of the old Greeks and Romans,\r\nhave endeavored to supply its place with all the extravagances of an\r\nirregular fancy.\"  In the following paper (No. 63), an \"allegorical\r\nvision of the encounter of True and False Wit,\" he discovers, \"in a very\r\ndark grove, a monstrous fabric, built after the Gothic manner and covered\r\nwith innumerable devices in that barbarous kind of sculpture.\" This\r\ntemple is consecrated to the God of Dullness, who is \"dressed in the\r\nhabit of a monk.\"  In his essay \"On Taste\" (No. 409) he says, \"I have\r\nendeavored, in several of my speculations, to banish this Gothic taste\r\nwhich has taken possession among us.\"\r\n\r\nThe particular literary vice which Addison strove to correct in these\r\npapers was that conceited style which infected a certain school of\r\nseventeenth-century poetry, running sometimes into such puerilities as\r\nanagrams, acrostics, echo-songs, rebuses, and verses in the shape of\r\neggs, wings, hour-glasses, etc.  He names, as special representatives of\r\nthis affectation, Herbert, Cowley, and Sylvester.  But it is significant\r\nthat Addison should have described this fashion as Gothic.  It has in\r\nreality nothing in common with the sincere and loving art of the old\r\nbuilders.  He might just as well have called it classic; for, as he\r\nacknowledges, devices of the kind are to be found in the Greek anthology,\r\nand Ovid was a poet given to conceits.  Addison was a writer of pure\r\ntaste, but the coldness and timidity of his imagination, and the maxims\r\nof the critical school to which he belonged, made him mistake for\r\nspurious decoration the efflorescence of that warm, creative fancy which\r\nran riot in Gothic art.  The grotesque, which was one expression of this\r\nsappy vigor, was abhorrent to Addison.  The art and poetry of his time\r\nwere tame, where Gothic art was wild; dead where Gothic was alive.  He\r\ncould not sympathize with it, nor understand it.  \"Vous ne pouvez pas le\r\ncomprendre; vous avez toujours haï la vie.\"\r\n\r\nI have quoted Vicesimus Knox's complaint that the antiquarian spirit was\r\nspreading from architecture and numismatics into literature.[4]  We meet\r\nwith satire upon antiquaries many years before this; in Pope, in\r\nAkenside's Spenserian poem \"The Virtuoso\" (1737); in Richard Owen\r\nCambridge's \"Scribleriad\" (1751):\r\n\r\n    \"See how her sons with generous ardor strive,\r\n    Bid every long-lost Gothic art revive,. . .\r\n    Each Celtic character explain, or show\r\n    How Britons ate a thousand years ago;\r\n    On laws of jousts and tournaments declaim,\r\n    Or shine, the rivals of the herald's fame.\r\n    But chief that Saxon wisdom be your care,\r\n    Preserve their idols and their fanes repair;\r\n    And may their deep mythology be shown\r\n    By Seater's wheel and Thor's tremendous throne.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThe most notable instance that we encounter of virtuosity invading the\r\nneighboring realm of literature is in the case of Strawberry Hill and\r\n\"The Castle of Otranto.\"  Horace Walpole, the son of the great prime\r\nminister, Robert Walpole, was a person of varied accomplishments and\r\nundoubted cleverness.  He was a man of fashion, a man of taste, and a man\r\nof letters; though, in the first of these characters, he entertained or\r\naffected a contempt for the last, not uncommon in dilettante authors and\r\ndandy artists, who belong to the _beau monde_ or are otherwise socially\r\nof high place, _teste_ Congreve, and even Byron, that \"rhyming peer.\"\r\nWalpole, as we have seen, had been an Eton friend of Gray and had\r\ntraveled--and quarreled--with him upon the Continent.  Returning home, he\r\ngot a seat in Parliament, the entrée at court, and various lucrative\r\nsinecures through his father's influence.  He was an assiduous courtier,\r\na keen and spiteful observer, a busy gossip and retailer of social\r\ntattle.  His feminine turn of mind made him a capital letter-writer; and\r\nhis correspondence, particularly with Sir Horace Mann, English ambassador\r\nat Florence, is a running history of backstairs diplomacy, court\r\nintrigue, subterranean politics, and fashionable scandal during the\r\nreigns of the second and third Georges.  He also figures as an historian\r\nof an amateurish sort, by virtue of his \"Catalogue of Royal and Noble\r\nAuthors,\" \"Anecdotes of Painting,\" and \"Historic Doubts on Richard III.\"\r\nOur present concern with him, however, lies quite outside of these.\r\n\r\nIt was about 1750 that Walpole, who had bought a villa at Strawberry\r\nHill, on the Thames near Windsor, which had formerly belonged to Mrs.\r\nChenevix, the fashionable London toy-woman, began to turn his house into\r\na miniature Gothic castle, in which he is said to have \"outlived three\r\nsets of his own battlements.\"  These architectural experiments went on\r\nfor some twenty years.  They excited great interest and attracted many\r\nvisitors, and Walpole may be regarded as having given a real impetus to\r\nthe revival of pointed architecture.  He spoke of Strawberry Hill as a\r\ncastle, but it was, in fact, an odd blend of ecclesiastical and\r\ncastellated Gothic applied to domestic uses.  He had a cloister, a\r\nchapel, a round tower, a gallery, a \"refectory,\" a stair-turret with\r\nGothic balustrade, stained windows, mural scutcheons, and Gothic\r\npaper-hangings.  Walpole's mock-gothic became something of a\r\nlaughing-stock, after the true principles of medieval architecture were\r\nbetter understood.  Since the time when Inigo Jones, court architect to\r\nJames I., came back from Italy, where he had studied the works of\r\nPalladio; and especially since the time when his successor, Sir\r\nChristopher Wren, had rebuilt St. Paul's in the Italian Renaissance\r\nstyle, after the great fire of London in 1664, Gothic had fallen more and\r\nmore into disuse.  \"If in the history of British art,\" says Eastlake,\r\n\"there is one period more distinguished than another for the neglect of\r\nGothic, it was certainly the middle of the eighteenth century.\"  But\r\narchitecture had this advantage over other arts, it had left memorials\r\nmore obvious and imposing.  Medieval literature was known only to the\r\ncurious, to collectors of manuscript romances and black-letter ballads.\r\nThe study of medieval arts like tempera painting, illuminating,\r\nglass-staining, wood-carving, tapestry embroidery; of the science of\r\nblazonry, of the details of ancient armor and costumes, was the pursuit\r\nof specialists.  But Westminster Abbey, the Tower of London, Salisbury\r\nCathedral, and York Minster, ruins such as Melrose and Fountain Abbeys,\r\nCrichton Castle, and a hundred others were impressive witnesses for the\r\ncivilization that had built them and must, sooner or later, demand\r\nrespectful attention.  Hence it is not strange that the Gothic revival\r\nwent hand in hand with the romantic movement in literature, if indeed it\r\ndid not give it its original impulse.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" says Eastlake,[6] speaking of Walpole, \"to peruse\r\neither the letters or the romances of this remarkable man, without being\r\nstruck by the unmistakable evidence which they contain of his medieval\r\npredilections.  His 'Castle of Otranto' was perhaps the first modern work\r\nof fiction which depended for its interest on the incidents of a\r\nchivalrous age, and it thus became the prototype of that class of novel\r\nwhich was afterward imitated by Mrs. Radcliffe and perfected by Sir\r\nWalter Scott.  The feudal tyrant, the venerable ecclesiastic, the forlorn\r\nbut virtuous damsel, the castle itself with its moats and drawbridge, its\r\ngloomy dungeons and solemn corridors, are all derived from a mine of\r\ninterest which has since been worked more efficiently and to better\r\nprofit.  But to Walpole must be awarded the credit of its discovery and\r\nfirst employment.\"\r\n\r\nWalpole's complete works[7] contain elaborate illustrations and ground\r\nplans of Strawberry Hill.  Eastlake give a somewhat technical account of\r\nits constructive features, its gables, buttresses, finials, lath and\r\nplaster parapets, wooden pinnacles and, what its proprietor himself\r\ndescribes as his \"lean windows fattened with rich saints.\"  From this I\r\nextract only the description of the interior, which was \"just what one\r\nmight expect from a man who possessed a vague admiration for Gothic\r\nwithout the knowledge necessary for a proper adaptation of its features.\r\nCeilings, screens, niches, etc., are all copied, or rather parodied, from\r\nexisting examples, but with utter disregard for the original purpose of\r\nthe design.  To Lord Orford, Gothic was Gothic, and that sufficed.  He\r\nwould have turned an altar-slab into a hall-table, or made a cupboard of\r\na piscine, with the greatest complacency, if it only served his purpose.\r\nThus we find that in the north bed-chamber, when he wanted a model for\r\nhis chimney-piece, he thought he could not do better than adopt the form\r\nof Bishop Dudley's tomb in Westminster Abbey.  He found a pattern for the\r\npiers of his garden gate in the choir of Ely Cathedral.\"  The ceiling of\r\nthe gallery borrowed a design from Henry VII.'s Chapel; the entrance to\r\nthe same apartment from the north door of St. Alban's; and one side of\r\nthe room from Archbishop Bourchier's tomb at Canterbury.  Eastlake's\r\nconclusion is that Walpole's Gothic, \"though far from reflecting the\r\nbeauties of a former age, or anticipating those which were destined to\r\nproceed from a re-development of the style, still holds a position in the\r\nhistory of English art which commands our respect, for it served to\r\nsustain a cause which had otherwise been well-nigh forsaken.\"\r\n\r\nJames Fergusson, in his \"History of the Modern Styles of Architecture,\"\r\nsays of Walpole's structures: \"We now know that these are very\r\nindifferent specimens of the true Gothic art, and are at a loss to\r\nunderstand how either their author or his contemporaries could ever fancy\r\nthat these very queer carvings were actual reproductions of the details\r\nof York Minster, or other equally celebrated buildings, from which they\r\nwere supposed to have been copied.\"  Fergusson adds that the fashion set\r\nby Walpole soon found many followers both in church and house\r\narchitecture, \"and it is surprising what a number of castles were built\r\nwhich had nothing castellated about them except a nicked parapet and an\r\noccasional window in the form of a cross.\"  That school of bastard Gothic\r\nillustrated by the buildings of Batty Langley, and other early restorers\r\nof the style, bears an analogy with the imitations of old English poetry\r\nin the last century.  There was the same prematurity in both, the same\r\ndefective knowledge, crudity, uncertainty, incorrectness, feebleness of\r\ninvention, mixture of ancient and modern manners.  It was not until the\r\ntime of Pugin[8] that the details of the medieval building art were well\r\nenough understood to enable the architect to work in the spirit of that\r\nart, yet not as a servile copyist, but with freedom and originality.\r\nMeanwhile, one service that Walpole and his followers did, by reviving\r\npublic interest in Gothic, was to arrest the process of dilapidation and\r\nsave the crumbling remains of many a half-ruinous abbey, castle, or\r\nbaronial hall.  Thus, \"when about a hundred years since, Rhyddlan Castle,\r\nin North Wales, fell into the possession of Dr. Shipley, Dean of St.\r\nAsaph, the massive walls had been prescriptively used as stone quarries,\r\nto which any neighboring occupier who wanted building materials might\r\nresort; and they are honey-combed all round as high as a pick-ax could\r\nreach.\"[9]  \"Walpole,\" writes Leslie Stephen, \"is almost the first modern\r\nEnglishman who found out that our old cathedrals were really beautiful.\r\nHe discovered that a most charming toy might be made of medievalism.\r\nStrawberry Hill, with all its gimcracks, its pasteboard battlements and\r\nstained-paper carvings, was the lineal ancestor of the new law-courts.\r\nThe restorers of churches, the manufacturers of stained glass, the modern\r\ndecorators and architects of all varieties, the Ritualists and the High\r\nChurch party, should think of him with kindness. . .  That he was quite\r\nconscious of the necessity for more serious study, appears in his\r\nletters; in one of which, _e.g._, he proposes a systematic history of\r\nGothic architecture such as has since been often executed.\"[10]  Mr.\r\nStephen adds that Walpole's friend Gray \"shared his Gothic tastes, with\r\ngreatly superior knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nWalpole did not arrive at his Gothicism by the gate of literature.  It\r\nwas merely a specialized development of his tastes as a virtuoso and\r\ncollector.  The museum of curiosities which he got together at Strawberry\r\nHill included not only suits of armor, stained glass, and illuminated\r\nmissals, but a miscellaneous treasure of china ware, enamels, faïence,\r\nbronzes, paintings, engravings, books, coins, bric-a-brac, and\r\nmemorabilia such as Cardinal Wolsey's hat, Queen Elizabeth's glove, and\r\nthe spur that William III. wore at the Battle of the Boyne.  Walpole's\r\nromanticism was a thin veneering; underneath it, he was a man of the\r\neighteenth century.  His opinions on all subjects were, if not\r\ninconsistent, at any rate notoriously whimsical and ill-assorted.  Thus\r\nin spite of his admiration for Gray and his--temporary--interest in\r\nOssian, Chatterton, and Percy's ballads, he ridiculed Mallet's and Gray's\r\nRunic experiments, spoke contemptuously of Spenser, Thomson, and\r\nAkenside, compared Dante to \"a Methodist parson in bedlam,\" and\r\npronounced \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" \"forty times more nonsensical than\r\nthe worst translation of any Italian opera-books.\"[11]  He said that\r\npoetry died with Pope, whose measure and manner he employed in his own\r\nverses.  It has been observed that, in all his correspondence, he makes\r\nbut a single mention of Froissart's \"Chronicle,\" and that a sneer at Lady\r\nPomfret for translating it.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we find, on turning to \"The Castle of Otranto,\" that, just as\r\nWalpole's Gothicism was an accidental \"sport\" from his general\r\nvirtuosity; so his romanticism was a casual outgrowth of his\r\narchitectural amusements.  Strawberry Hill begat \"The Castle of Otranto,\"\r\nwhose title is fitly chosen, since it is the castle itself that is the\r\nhero of the book.  The human characters are naught.  \"Shall I even\r\nconfess to you,\" he writes to the Rev. William Cole (March 9, 1765),\r\n\"what was the origin of this romance?  I waked one morning in the\r\nbeginning of last June from a dream, of which all I could recover was,\r\nthat I had thought myself in an ancient castle (a very natural dream for\r\na head filled, like mine, with Gothic story), and that, on the uppermost\r\nbanister of a great staircase, I saw a gigantic hand in armor.  In the\r\nevening I sat down and began to write, without knowing in the least what\r\nI intended to say or relate.  The work grew on my hands. . .  In short, I\r\nwas so engrossed with my tale, which I completed in less than two months,\r\nthat one evening I wrote from the time I had drunk my tea, about six\r\no'clock, till half an hour after one in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic Story,\" was published in 1765.[12]\r\nAccording to the title page, it was translated from the original Italian\r\nof Onuphrio Muralto--a sort of half-pun on the author's surname--by W.\r\nMarshall, Gent.  This mystification was kept up in the preface, which\r\npretended that the book had been printed at Naples in black-letter in\r\n1529, and was found in the library of an old Catholic family in the north\r\nof England.  In the preface to his second edition Walpole described the\r\nwork as \"an attempt to blend the two kinds of romance, the ancient and\r\nthe modern\": declared that, in introducing humorous dialogues among the\r\nservants of the castle, he had taken nature and Shakspere for his models;\r\nand fell foul of Voltaire for censuring the mixture of buffoonery and\r\nsolemnity in Shakspere's tragedies.  Walpole's claim to having created a\r\nnew species of romance has been generally allowed.  \"His initiative in\r\nliterature,\" says Mr. Stephen, \"has been as fruitful as his initiative in\r\nart.  'The Castle of Otranto,' and the 'Mysterious Mother,' were the\r\nprogenitors of Mrs. Radcliffe's romances, and probably had a strong\r\ninfluence upon the author of 'Ivanhoe.'  Frowning castles and gloomy\r\nmonasteries, knights in armor and ladies in distress, and monks, and\r\nnuns, and hermits; all the scenery and characters that have peopled the\r\nimagination of the romantic school, may be said to have had their origin\r\non the night when Walpole lay down to sleep, his head crammed full of\r\nWardour Street curiosities, and dreamed that he saw a gigantic hand in\r\narmor resting on the banisters of his staircase.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible at this day to take \"The Castle of Otranto\" seriously,\r\nand hard to explain the respect with which it was once mentioned by\r\nwriters of authority.  Warburton called it \"a master-piece in the Fable,\r\nand a new species likewise. . .  The scene is laid in Gothic chivalry;\r\nwhere a beautiful imagination, supported by strength of judgment, has\r\nenabled the reader to go beyond his subject and effect the full purpose\r\nof the ancient tragedy; _i.e._, to purge the passions by pity and terror,\r\nin coloring as great and harmonious as in any of the best dramatic\r\nwriters.\"  Byron called Walpole the author of the last tragedy[13] and\r\nthe first romance in the language.  Scott wrote of \"The Castle of\r\nOtranto\": \"This romance has been justly considered, not only as the\r\noriginal and model of a peculiar species of composition attempted and\r\nsuccessfully executed by a man of great genius, but as one of the\r\nstandard works of our lighter literature.\"  Gray in a letter to Walpole\r\n(December 30, 1764), acknowledging the receipt of his copy, says: \"It\r\nmakes some of us cry a little, and all in general afraid to go to bed o'\r\nnights.\"  Walpole's masterpiece can no longer make anyone cry even a\r\nlittle; and instead of keeping us out of bed, it sends us there--or\r\nwould, if it were a trifle longer.  For the only thing that is tolerable\r\nabout the book is its brevity, and a certain rapidity in the action.\r\nMacaulay, who confesses its absurdity and insipidity, says that no\r\nreader, probably, ever thought it dull.  \"The story, whatever its value\r\nmay be, never flags for a single moment.  There are no digressions, or\r\nunreasonable descriptions, or long speeches.  Every sentence carries the\r\naction forward.  The excitement is constantly renewed.\"  Excitement is\r\ntoo strong a word to describe any emotion which \"The Castle of Otranto\"\r\nis now capable of arousing.  But the same cleverness which makes\r\nWalpole's correspondence always readable saves his romance from the\r\nunpardonable sin--in literature--of tediousness.  It does go along and\r\nmay still be read without a too painful effort.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very new in the plot, which has all the stock properties\r\nof romantic fiction, as common in the days of Sidney's \"Arcadia\" as in\r\nthose of Sylvanus Cobb.  Alfonso, the former lord of Otranto, had been\r\npoisoned in Palestine by his chamberlain Ricardo, who forged a will\r\nmaking himself Alfonso's heir.  To make his peace with God, the usurper\r\nfounded a church and two convents in honor of St. Nicholas, who \"appeared\r\nto him in a dream and promised that Ricardo's posterity should reign in\r\nOtranto until the rightful owner should be grown too large to inhabit the\r\ncastle.\"  When the story opens, this prophecy is about to be fulfilled.\r\nThe tyrant Manfred, grandson of the usurper, is on the point of\r\ncelebrating the marriage of his only son, when the youth is crushed to\r\ndeath by a colossal helmet that drops, from nobody knows where, into the\r\ncourtyard of the castle.  Gigantic armor haunts the castle piecemeal: a\r\nmonstrous gauntlet is laid upon the banister of the great staircase; a\r\nmailed foot appears in one apartment; a sword is brought into the\r\ncourtyard on the shoulders of a hundred men.  And finally the proprietor\r\nof these fragmentary apparitions, in \"the form of Alfonso, dilated to an\r\nimmense magnitude,\" throws down the walls of the castle, pronounces the\r\nwords \"Behold in Theodore the true heir of Alfonso,\" and with a clap of\r\nthunder ascends to heaven.  Theodore is, of course, the young peasant,\r\ngrandson of the crusader by a fair Sicilian secretly espoused _en route_\r\nfor the Holy Land; and he is identified by the strawberry mark of old\r\nromance, in this instance the figure of a bloody arrow impressed upon his\r\nshoulder.  There are other supernatural portents, such as a skeleton with\r\na cowl and a hollow voice, a portrait which descends from its panel, and\r\na statue that bleeds at the nose.\r\n\r\nThe novel feature in the \"Castle of Otranto\" was its Gothic setting; the\r\n\"wind whistling through the battlements\"; the secret trap-door, with iron\r\nring, by which Isabella sought to make her escape.  \"An awful silence\r\nreigned throughout those subterraneous regions, except now and then some\r\nblasts of wind that shook the doors she had passed, and which, grating on\r\nthe rusty hinges, were re-echoed through that long labyrinth of darkness.\r\nThe wind extinguished her candle, but an imperfect ray of clouded\r\nmoonshine gleamed through a cranny in the roof of the vault and fell\r\ndirectly on the spring of the trap-door.\"  But Walpole's medievalism was\r\nvery thin.  He took some pains with the description of the feudal\r\ncavalcade entering the castle gate with the great sword, but the passage\r\nis incorrect and poor in detail compared with similar things in Scott.\r\nThe book was not an historical romance, and the manners, sentiments,\r\nlanguage, all were modern.  Walpole knew little about the Middle Ages and\r\nwas not in touch with their spirit.  At bottom he was a trifler, a\r\nfribble; and his incurable superficiality, dilettantism, and want of\r\nseriousness, made all his real cleverness of no avail when applied to\r\nsuch a subject as \"The Castle of Otranto.\"[14]\r\n\r\nWalpole's tragedy, \"The Mysterious Mother,\" has not even that degree of\r\nimportance which secures his romance a niche in literary history.  The\r\nsubject was too unnatural to admit of stage presentation.  Incest, when\r\ntreated in the manner of Sophocles (Walpole justified himself by the\r\nexample of \"Oedipus\"), or even of Ford, or of Shelley, may possibly claim\r\na place among the themes which art is not quite forbidden to touch; but\r\nwhen handled in the prurient and crudely melodramatic fashion of this\r\nparticular artist, it is merely offensive.  \"The Mysterious Mother,\"\r\nindeed, is even more absurd than horrible.  Gothic machinery is present,\r\nbut it is of the slightest.  The scene of the action is a castle at\r\nNarbonne and the _châtelaine_ is the heroine of the play.  The other\r\ncharacters are knights, friars, orphaned damsels, and feudal retainers;\r\nthere is mention of cloisters, drawbridges, the Vaudois heretics, and the\r\nassassination of Henri III. and Henri IV.; and the author's Whig and\r\nProtestant leanings are oddly evidenced in his exposure of priestly\r\nintrigues.\r\n\r\n\"The Castle of Otranto\" was not long in finding imitators.  One of the\r\nfirst of these was Clara Reeve's \"Champion of Virtue\" (1777), styled on\r\nits title-page \"A Gothic Story,\" and reprinted the following year as \"The\r\nOld English Baron.\"  Under this latter title it has since gone through\r\nthirteen editions, the latest of which, in 1883, gave a portrait of the\r\nauthor.  Miss Reeve had previously published (1772) \"The Phoenix,\" a\r\ntranslation of \"Argenis,\" \"a romance written in Latin about the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth century, by John Barclay, a Scotchman, and supposed to\r\ncontain an allegorical account of the civil wars of France during the\r\nreign of Henry III.\"[15]  \"Pray,\" inquires the author of \"The Champion of\r\nVirtue\" in her address to the reader, \"did you ever read a book called,\r\n'The Castle of Otranto'?  If you have, you will willingly enter with me\r\ninto a review of it.  But perhaps you have not read it?  However, you\r\nhave heard that it is an attempt to blend together the most attractive\r\nand interesting circumstances of the ancient romance and modern\r\nnovel. . .  The conduct of the story is artful and judicious; and the\r\ncharacters are admirably drawn and supported; the diction polished and\r\nelegant; yet with all these brilliant advantages, it palls upon the\r\nmind. . .  The reason is obvious; the machinery is so violent that it\r\ndestroys the effect it is intended to excite.  Had the story been kept\r\nwithin the utmost _verge_ of probability, the effect had been\r\npreserved. . .  For instance, we can conceive and allow of the appearance\r\nof a ghost; we can even dispense with an enchanted sword and helmet, but\r\nthen they must keep within certain limits of credibility.  A sword so\r\nlarge as to require a hundred men to lift it, a helmet that by its own\r\nweight forces a passage through a court-yard into an arched\r\nvault . . . when your expectation is wound up to the highest pitch, these\r\ncircumstances take it down with a witness, destroy the work of\r\nimagination, and, instead of attention, excite laughter. . .  In the\r\ncourse of my observations upon this singular book, it seemed to me that\r\nit was possible to compose a work upon the same plan, wherein these\r\ndefects might be avoided.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly Miss Reeve undertook to admit only a rather mild dose of the\r\nmarvelous in her romance.  Like Walpole she professed to be simply the\r\neditor of the story, which she said that she had transcribed or\r\ntranslated from a manuscript in the Old English language, a now somewhat\r\nthreadbare device.  The period was the fifteenth century, in the reign of\r\nHenry VI., and the scene England.  But, in spite of the implication of\r\nits sub-title, the fiction is much less \"Gothic\" than its model, and its\r\nmodernness of sentiment and manners is hardly covered with even the\r\nfaintest wash of mediaevalism.  As in Walpole's book, there are a murder\r\nand a usurpation, a rightful heir defrauded of his inheritance and reared\r\nas a peasant.  There are a haunted chamber, unearthly midnight groans, a\r\nghost in armor, and a secret closet with its skeleton.  The tale is\r\ninfinitely tiresome, and is full of that edifying morality, fine\r\nsentiment and stilted dialogue--that \"old perfumed, powdered D'Arblay\r\nconversation,\" as Thackeray called it--which abound in \"Evelina,\"\r\n\"Thaddeus of Warsaw,\" and almost all the fiction of the last quarter of\r\nthe last century.  Still it was a little unkind in Walpole to pronounce\r\nhis disciple's performance tedious and insipid, as he did.\r\n\r\nThis same lady published, in 1785, a work in two volumes entitled \"The\r\nProgress of Romance,\" a sort of symposium on the history of fiction in a\r\nseries of evening conversations.  Her purpose was to claim for the prose\r\nromance an honorable place in literature; a place beside the verse epic.\r\nShe discusses the definitions of romance given in the current\r\ndictionaries, such as Ainsworth's and Littleton's _Narratio\r\nficta--Scriptum eroticum--Splendida fabula_; and Johnson's \"A military\r\nfable of the Middle Ages--A tale of wild adventures of war and love.\"\r\nShe herself defines it as \"An heroic fable,\" or \"An epic in prose.\"  She\r\naffirms that Homer is the father of romance and thinks it astonishing\r\nthat men of sense \"should despise and ridicule romances, as the most\r\ncontemptible of all kinds of writing, and yet expatiate in raptures on\r\nthe beauties of the fables of the old classic poets--on stories far more\r\nwild and extravagant and infinitely more incredible.\"  After reviewing\r\nthe Greek romances, like Heliodorus' \"Theagenes and Chariclea,\" she\r\npasses on to the chivalry tales of the Middle Ages, which, she maintains,\r\n\"were by no means so contemptible as they have been represented by later\r\nwriters.\"  Our poetry, she thinks, owes more than is imagined to the\r\nspirit of romance.  \"Chaucer and all our old writers abound with it.\r\nSpenser owes perhaps his immortality to it; it is the Gothic imagery that\r\ngives the principal graces to his work. . .  Spenser has made more poets\r\nthan any other writer of our country.\"  Milton, too, had a hankering\r\nafter the romances; and Cervantes, though he laughed Spain's chivalry\r\naway, loved the thing he laughed at and preferred his serious romance\r\n\"Persiles and Sigismonda\" to all his other works.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe gives a list, with conjectural dates, of many medieval romances in\r\nFrench and English, verse and prose; but the greater part of the book is\r\noccupied with contemporary fiction, the novels of Richardson, Fielding,\r\nSmollett, Crébillon, Marivaux, Rousseau, etc.  She commends Thomas\r\nLeland's historical romance \"Longsword, Earl of Salisbury\" (1762), as \"a\r\nromance in reality, and not a novel:--a story like those of the Middle\r\nAges, composed of chivalry, love, and religion.\"  To her second volume\r\nshe appended the \"History of Charoba, Queen of Egypt,\" englished from the\r\nFrench of Vattier, professor of Arabic to Louis XIV., who had translated\r\nit from a history of ancient Egypt written in Arabic.  This was the\r\nsource of Landor's poem, \"Gebir.\"  When Landor was in Wales in 1797, Rose\r\nAylmer--\r\n\r\n    \"Rose Aylmer, whom these wakeful eyes,\r\n    May weep but never see\"--\r\n\r\nlent him a copy of Miss Reeve's \"Progress of Romance,\" borrowed from a\r\ncirculating library at Swansea.  And so the poor forgotten thing retains\r\na vicarious immortality, as the prompter of some of the noblest passages\r\nin modern English blank verse and as associated with one of the tenderest\r\npassages in Landor's life.\r\n\r\nMiss Reeve quotes frequently from Percy's \"Essay on the Ancient\r\nMinstrels,\" mentions Ossian and Chatterton and refers to Hurd, Warton,\r\nand other authorities.  \"It was not till I had completed my design,\" she\r\nwrites in her preface, \"that I read either Dr. Beattie's 'Dissertation on\r\nFable and Romance' or Mr. Warton's 'History of English Poetry.'\"  The\r\nformer of these was an essay of somewhat more than a hundred pages by the\r\nauthor of \"The Minstrel.\"  It is of no great importance and follows\r\npretty closely the lines of Hurd's \"Letters on Chivalry and Romance,\" to\r\nwhich Beattie repeatedly refers in his footnotes.  The author pursues the\r\nbeaten track in inquiries of the kind: discusses the character of the\r\nGothic tribes, the nature of the feudal system, and the institutions of\r\nchivalry and knight-errantry.  Romance, it seems, was \"one of the\r\nconsequences of chivalry.  The first writers in this way exhibited a\r\nspecies of fable different from all that had hitherto appeared.  They\r\nundertook to describe the adventures of those heroes who professed\r\nknight-errantry.  The world was then ignorant and credulous and\r\npassionately fond of wonderful adventures and deeds of valor.  They\r\nbelieved in giants, dwarfs, dragons, enchanted castles, and every\r\nimaginable species of necromancy.  These form the materials of the old\r\nromance.  The knight-errant was described as courteous, religious,\r\nvaliant, adventurous, and temperate.  Some enchanters befriended and\r\nothers opposed him.  To do his mistress honor, and to prove himself\r\nworthy of her, he was made to encounter the warrior, hew down the giant,\r\ncut the dragon in pieces, break the spell of the necromancer, demolish\r\nthe enchanted castle, fly through the air on wooden or winged horses, or,\r\nwith some magician for his guide, to descend unhurt through the opening\r\nearth and traverse the caves in the bottom of the ocean.  He detected and\r\npunished the false knight, overthrew or converted the infidel, restored\r\nthe exiled monarch to his dominions and the captive damsel to her\r\nparents; he fought at the tournament, feasted in the hall, and bore a\r\npart in the warlike processions.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very startling in these conclusions.  Scholars like\r\nPercy, Tyrwhitt, and Ritson, who, as collectors and editors, rescued the\r\nfragments of ancient ministrelsy and gave the public access to concrete\r\nspecimens of mediaeval poetry, performed a more useful service than mild\r\nclerical essayists, such as Beattie and Hurd, who amused their leisure\r\nwith general speculations about the origin of romance and whether it came\r\nin the first instance from the troubadours or the Saracens or the\r\nNorsemen.  One more passage, however, may be transcribed from Beattie's\r\n\"Dissertation,\" because it seems clearly a suggestion from \"The Castle of\r\nOtranto.\"  \"The castles of the greater barons, reared in a rude but grand\r\nstyle of architecture, full of dark and winding passages, of secret\r\napartments, of long uninhabited galleries, and of chambers supposed to be\r\nhaunted with spirits, and undermined by subterraneous labyrinths as\r\nplaces of retreat in extreme danger; the howling of winds through the\r\ncrevices of old walls and other dreary vacuities; the grating of heavy\r\ndoors on rusty hinges of iron; the shrieking of bats and the screaming of\r\nowls and other creatures that resort to desolate or half-inhabited\r\nbuildings; these and the like circumstances in the domestic life of the\r\npeople I speak of, would multiply their superstitions and increase their\r\ncredulity; and among warriors who set all danger at defiance, would\r\nencourage a passion for wild adventure and difficult enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the books reviewed by Miss Reeve is worth mentioning, not for its\r\nintrinsic importance, but for its early date.  \"Longsword, Earl of\r\nSalisbury, An Historical Romance,\" in two volumes, and published two\r\nyears before \"The Castle of Otranto,\" is probably the first fiction of\r\nthe kind in English literature.  Its author was Thomas Leland, an Irish\r\nhistorian and doctor of divinity.[16]  \"The outlines of the following\r\nstory,\" begins the advertisement, \"and some of the incidents and more\r\nminute circumstances, are to be found in some of the ancient English\r\nhistories.\"  The period of the action is the reign of Henry III.  The\r\nking is introduced in person, and when we hear him swearing \"by my\r\nHalidome,\" we rub our eyes and ask, \"Can this be Scott?\"  But we are soon\r\ndisabused, for the romance, in spite of the words of the advertisement,\r\nis very little historical, and the fashion of it is thinly wordy and\r\nsentimental.  The hero is the son of Henry II. and Fair Rosamond, but his\r\nspeech is Grandisonian.  The adventures are of the usual kind: the\r\n_dramatis personae_ include gallant knights who go a-tilting with their\r\nladies' gloves upon their casques, usurpers, villains, pirates, a wicked\r\nmonk who tries to poison the hero, an oppressed countess, a distressed\r\ndamsel disguised as a page, a hermit who has a cave in a mountain side,\r\netc.  The Gothic properties are few; though the frontispiece to the first\r\nvolume represents a cowled monk raising from the ground the figure of a\r\nswooning knight in complete armor, in front of an abbey church with an\r\nimage of the Virgin and Child sculptured in a niche above the door; and\r\nthe building is thus described in the text: \"Its windows crowded with the\r\nfoliage of their ornaments, and dimmed by the hand of the painter; its\r\nnumerous spires towering above the roof, and the Christian ensign on its\r\nfront, declared it a residence of devotion and charity.\"  An episode in\r\nthe story narrates the death of a father by the hand of his son in the\r\nBarons' War of Henry III.  But no farther advantage is taken of the\r\nhistoric background afforded by this civil conflict, nor is Simon de\r\nMontfort so much as named in the whole course of the book.\r\n\r\nClara Reeve was the daughter of a clergyman.  She lived and died at\r\nIpswich (1725-1803).  Walter Scott contributed a memoir of her to\r\n\"Ballantyne's Novelists' Library,\" in which he defended Walpole's frank\r\nuse of the supernatural against her criticisms, quoted above, and gave\r\nthe preference to Walpole's method.[17]  She acknowledged that her\r\nromance was a \"literary descendant of 'Otranto';\" but the author of the\r\nlatter, evidently nettled by her strictures, described \"The Old English\r\nBaron,\" as \"Otranto reduced to reason and probability,\" and declared that\r\nany murder trial at the Old Bailey would have made a more interesting\r\nstory.  Such as it is, it bridges the interval between its model and the\r\nnovels of Mrs. Radcliffe, Lewis' \"Monk\" (1795), and Maturin's \"Fatal\r\nRevenge, or the Family of Montorio\" (1807).[18]\r\n\r\nAnne Radcliffe--born Ward in 1764, the year of \"Otranto\"--was the wife of\r\nan editor, who was necessarily absent from home much of the time until\r\nlate at night.  A large part of her writing was done to amuse her\r\nloneliness in the still hours of evening; and the wildness of her\r\nimagination, and the romantic love of night and solitude which pervades\r\nher books, are sometimes accounted for in this way.  In 1809 it was\r\ncurrently reported and believed that Mrs. Radcliffe was dead.  Another\r\nform of the rumor was that she had been insane by continually poring over\r\nvisions of horror and mystery.  Neither report was true; she lived till\r\n1823, in full possession of her faculties, although she published nothing\r\nafter 1797.  The circulation of such stories shows how retired, and even\r\nobscure, a life this very popular writer contrived to lead.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to give here an analysis of these once famous\r\nfictions _seriatim_.[19]  They were very long, very much alike, and very\r\nmuch overloaded with sentiment and description.  The plots were\r\ncomplicated and abounded in the wildest improbabilities and in those\r\nincidents which were once the commonplaces of romantic fiction and which\r\nrealism has now turned out of doors: concealments, assassinations, duels,\r\ndisguises, kidnappings, escapes, elopements, intrigues, forged documents,\r\ndiscoveries of old crimes, and identifications of lost heirs.  The\r\ncharacters, too, were of the conventional kind.  There were dark-browed,\r\ncrime-stained villains--forerunners, perhaps of Manfred and Lara, for the\r\ncritics think that Mrs. Radcliffe's stories were not without important\r\ninfluence on Byron.[20]  There were high-born, penitent dames who retired\r\nto convents in expiation of sins which are not explained until the\r\ngeneral raveling of clews in the final chapter.  There were bravoes,\r\nbanditti, feudal tyrants, monks, inquisitors, soubrettes, and simple\r\ndomestics _a la_ Bianca, in Walpole's romance.  The lover was of the type\r\nadored by our great-grandmothers, handsome, melancholy, passionate,\r\nrespectful but desperate, a user of most choice English; with large black\r\neyes, smooth white forehead, and jetty curls, now sunk, Mr. Perry says,\r\nto the covers of prune boxes.  The heroine, too, was sensitive and\r\nmelancholy.  When alone upon the seashore or in the mountains, at sunset\r\nor twilight, or under the midnight moon, or when the wind is blowing, she\r\noverflows into stanza or sonnet, \"To Autumn,\" \"To Sunset,\" \"To the Bat,\"\r\n\"To the Nightingale,\" \"To the Winds,\" \"To Melancholy,\" \"Song of the\r\nEvening Hour.\"  We have heard this pensive music drawing near in the\r\nstrains of the Miltonic school, but in Mrs. Radcliffe the romantic gloom\r\nis profound and all-pervading.  In what pastures she had fed is manifest\r\nfrom the verse captions that head her chapters, taken mainly from Blair,\r\nThomson, Warton, Gray, Collins, Beattie, Mason, and Walpole's \"Mysterious\r\nMother.\"  Here are a few stanzas from her ode \"To Melancholy\":\r\n\r\n    \"Spirit of love and sorrow, hail!\r\n      Thy solemn voice from far I hear,\r\n    Mingling with evening's dying gale:\r\n      Hail, with thy sadly pleasing tear!\r\n\r\n    \"O at this still, this lonely hour--\r\n      Thine own sweet hour of closing day--\r\n    Awake thy lute, whose charmful power\r\n      Shall call up fancy to obey:\r\n\r\n    \"To paint the wild, romantic dream\r\n      That meets the poet's closing eye,\r\n    As on the bank of shadowy stream\r\n      He breathes to her the fervid sigh.\r\n\r\n    \"O lonely spirit, let thy song\r\n      Lead me through all thy sacred haunt,\r\n    The minster's moonlight aisles along\r\n      Where specters raise the midnight chant.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Radcliffe's romances we find a tone that is absent from\r\nWalpole's: romanticism plus sentimentalism.  This last element had begun\r\nto infuse itself into general literature about the middle of the century,\r\nas a protest and reaction against the emotional coldness of the classical\r\nage.  It announced itself in Richardson, Rousseau, and the youthful\r\nGoethe; in the _comédie larmoyante_, both French and English; found its\r\ncleverest expression in Sterne, and then, becoming a universal vogue,\r\ndeluged fiction with productions like Mackenzie's \"Man of Feeling,\" Miss\r\nBurney's \"Evelina,\" and the novels of Jane Porter and Mrs. Opie.\r\nThackeray said that there was more crying in \"Thaddeus of Warsaw\" than in\r\nany novel he ever remembered to have read.[21]  Emily, in the \"Mysteries\r\nof Udolpho\" cannot see the moon, or hear a guitar or an organ or the\r\nmurmur of the pines, without weeping.  Every page is bedewed with the\r\ntear of sensibility; the whole volume is damp with it, and ever and anon\r\na chorus of sobs goes up from the entire company.  Mrs. Radcliffe's\r\nheroines are all descendents of Pamela and Clarissa Harlowe, but under\r\nmore romantic circumstances.  They are beset with a thousand\r\ndifficulties; carried off by masked ruffians, immured in convents, held\r\ncaptive in robber castles, encompassed with horrors natural and\r\nsupernatural, persecuted, threatened with murder and with rape.  But\r\nthough perpetually sighing, blushing, trembling, weeping, fainting, they\r\nhave at bottom a kind of toughness that endures through all.  They rebuke\r\nthe wicked in stately language, full of noble sentiments and moral\r\ntruths.  They preserve the most delicate feelings of propriety in\r\nsituations the most discouraging.  Emily, imprisoned in the gloomy castle\r\nof Udolpho, in the power of ruffians whose brawls and orgies fill night\r\nand day with horror, in hourly fear for her virtue and her life, sends\r\nfor the lord of the castle,--whom she believes to have murdered her\r\naunt,--and reminds him that, as her protectress is now dead, it would not\r\nbe proper for her to stay any longer under his roof thus unchaperoned,\r\nand will he please, therefore, send her home?\r\n\r\nMrs. Radcliffe's fictions are romantic, but not usually mediaeval in\r\nsubject.  In the \"Mysteries of Udolpho,\" the period of the action is the\r\nend of the sixteenth century; in the \"Romance of the Forest,\" 1658; in\r\n\"The Italian,\" about 1760.  But her machinery is prevailingly Gothic and\r\nthe real hero of the story is commonly, as in Walpole, some haunted\r\nbuilding.  In the \"Mysteries of Udolpho\" it is a castle in the Apennines;\r\nin the \"Romance of the Forest,\" a deserted abbey in the depth of the\r\nwoods; in \"The Italian,\" the cloister of the Black Penitents.  The\r\nmoldering battlements, the worm-eaten tapestries, the turret staircases,\r\nsecret chambers, underground passages, long, dark corridors where the\r\nwind howls dismally, and distant doors which slam at midnight all derive\r\nfrom \"Otranto.\"  So do the supernatural fears which haunt these abodes of\r\ndesolation; the strains of mysterious music, the apparitions which glide\r\nthrough the shadowy apartments, the hollow voices that warn the tyrant to\r\nbeware.  But her method here is quite different from Walpole's; she tacks\r\na natural explanation to every unearthly sight or sound.  The hollow\r\nvoices turn out to be ventriloquism; the figure of a putrefying corpse\r\nwhich Emily sees behind the black curtain in the ghost chamber at Udolpho\r\nis only a wax figure, contrived as a _memento mori_ for a former\r\npenitent.  After the reader has once learned this trick he refuses to be\r\nimposed upon again, and, whenever he encounters a spirit, feels sure that\r\na future chapter will embody it back into flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of testimony to the popularity of these romances.\r\nThackeray says that a lady of his acquaintance, an inveterate novel\r\nreader, names Valancourt as one of the favorite heroes of her youth.\r\n\"'Valancourt?  And who was he?' cry the young people.  Valancourt, my\r\ndears, was the hero of one of the most famous romances which ever was\r\npublished in this country.  The beauty and elegance of Valancourt made\r\nyour young grandmamma's' gentle hearts to beat with respectful sympathy.\r\nHe and his glory have passed away. . .  Enquire at Mudie's or the London\r\nLibrary, who asks for the 'Mysteries of Udolpho' now.\"[22]  Hazlitt said\r\nthat he owed to Mrs. Radcliffe his love of moonlight nights, autumn\r\nleaves and decaying ruins.  It was, indeed, in the melodramatic\r\nmanipulation of landscape that this artist was most original.  \"The\r\nscenes that savage Rosa dashed\" seemed to have been her model, and\r\ncritics who were fond of analogy called her the Salvator Rosa of fiction.\r\nIt is here that her influence on Byron and Chateaubriand is most\r\napparent.[23]  Mrs. Radcliffe's scenery is not quite to our modern taste,\r\nany more than are Salvator's paintings.  Her Venice by moonlight, her\r\nmountain gorges with their black pines and foaming torrents, are not\r\nprecisely the Venice and the Alps of Ruskin; rather of the operatic\r\nstage.  Still they are impressive in their way, and in this department\r\nshe possessed genuine poetic feels and a real mastery of the art of\r\npainting in distemper.  Witness the picture of the castle of Udolpho, on\r\nEmily's first sight of it, and the hardly less striking description, in\r\nthe \"Romance of the Forest,\" of the ruined abbey in which the La Motte\r\nfamily take refuge: \"He approached and perceived the Gothic remains of an\r\nabbey: it stood on a kind of rude lawn, overshadowed by high and\r\nspreading trees, which seemed coeval with the building, and diffused a\r\nromantic gloom around.  The greater part of the pile appeared to be\r\nsinking into ruins, and that which had withstood the ravages of time\r\nshowed the remaining features of the fabric more awful in decay.  The\r\nlofty battlements, thickly enwreathed with ivy, were half demolished and\r\nbecome the residence of birds of prey.  Huge fragments of the eastern\r\ntower, which was almost demolished, lay scattered amid the high grass,\r\nthat waved slowly in the breeze.  'The thistle shook its lonely head: the\r\nmoss whistled to the wind.'[24]  A Gothic gate, richly ornamented with\r\nfretwork, which opened into the main body of the edifice, but which was\r\nnow obstructed with brushwood, remained entire.  Above the vast and\r\nmagnificent portal of this gate arose a window of the same order, whose\r\npointed arches still exhibited fragments of stained glass, once the pride\r\nof monkish devotion.  La Motte, thinking it possible it might yet shelter\r\nsome human being, advanced to the gate and lifted a massy knocker.  The\r\nhollow sounds rung through the emptiness of the place.  After waiting a\r\nfew minutes, he forced back the gate, which was heavy with iron-work, and\r\ncreaked harshly on its hinges. . .  From this chapel he passed into the\r\nnave of the great church, of which one window, more perfect than the\r\nrest, opened upon a long vista of the forest, through which was seen the\r\nrich coloring of evening, melting by imperceptible gradations into the\r\nsolemn gray of upper air.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Radcliffe never was in Italy or Switzerland or the south of France;\r\nshe divined the scenery of her romances from pictures and descriptions at\r\nsecond hand.  But she accompanied her husband in excursions to the Lakes\r\nand other parts of England, and in 1794 made the tour of the Rhine.[25]\r\nThe passages in her diary, recording these travels, are much superior in\r\nthe truthfulness and local color of their nature sketching to anything in\r\nher novels.  Mrs. Radcliffe is furthermore to be credited with a certain\r\nskill in producing terror, by the use of that favorite weapon in the\r\narmory of the romanticists, mystery.  If she did not invent a new\r\nshudder, as Hugo said of Baudelaire, she gave at least a new turn to the\r\nold-fashioned ghost story.  She creates in her readers a feeling of\r\nimpending danger, suspense, foreboding.  There is a sense of unearthly\r\npresences in these vast, empty rooms; the silence itself is ominous;\r\nechoes sound like footfalls, ghostly shadows lurk in dark corners,\r\nwhispers come from behind the arras, as it stirs in the gusts of\r\nwind.[26]  The heroine is afraid to look in the glass lest she should see\r\nanother face there beside her own; her lamp expires and leaves her in the\r\ndark just as she is coming to the critical point in the manuscript which\r\nshe has found in an old chest, etc., etc.,  But the tale loses its\r\nimpressiveness as soon as it strays beyond the shade of the battlements.\r\nThe Gothic castle or priory is still, as in Walpole, the nucleus of the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nTwo of these romances, the earliest and the latest, though they are the\r\nweakest of the series, have a special interest for us as affording points\r\nof comparison with the Waverly novels.  \"The Castles of Athlin and\r\nDunbayne\" is the narrative of a feud between two Highland clans, and its\r\nscene is the northeastern coast of Scotland, \"in the most romantic part\r\nof the Highlands,\" where the castle of Athlin--like Uhland's \"Schloss am\r\nMeer\"--stood \"on the summit of a rock whose base was in the sea.\"  This\r\nwas a fine place for storms.  \"The winds burst in sudden squalls over the\r\ndeep and dashed the foaming waves against the rocks with inconceivable\r\nfury.  The spray, notwithstanding the high situation of the castle, flew\r\nup with violence against the windows. . .  The moon shone faintly by\r\nintervals, through broken clouds, upon the waters, illumining the white\r\nfoam which burst around. . .  The surges broke on the distant shores in\r\ndeep resounding murmurs, and the solemn pauses between the stormy gusts\r\nfilled the mind with enthusiastic awe.\"  Perhaps the description slightly\r\nreminds of the picture, in \"Marmion,\" of Tantallon Castle, the hold of\r\nthe Red Douglases on the German Ocean, a little north of Berwick, whose\r\nfrowning towers have recently done duty again in Stevenson's \"David\r\nBalfour.\"  The period of the action is but vaguely indicated; but, as the\r\nweapons used in the attack on the castle are bows and arrows, we may\r\nregard the book as mediaeval in intention.  Scott says that the scene of\r\nthe romance was Scotland in the dark ages, and complains that the author\r\nevidently knew nothing of Scottish life or scenery.  This is true; her\r\ncastles might have stood anywhere.  There is no mention of the pipes or\r\nthe plaid.  Her rival chiefs are not Gaelic caterans, but just plain\r\nfeudal lords.  Her baron of Dunbayne is like any other baron; or rather,\r\nhe is unlike any baron that ever was on sea or land or anywhere else\r\nexcept in the pages of a Gothic romance.\r\n\r\n\"Gaston de Blondville\" was begun in 1802 and published posthumously in\r\n1826, edited by Sergeant Talfourd.  Its inspiring cause was a visit which\r\nthe author made in the autumn of 1802 to Warwick Castle and the ruins of\r\nKenilworth.  The introduction has the usual fiction of an old manuscript\r\nfound in an oaken chest dug up from the foundation of a chapel of Black\r\nCanons at Kenilworth: a manuscript richly illuminated with designs at the\r\nhead of each chapter--which are all duly described--and containing a\r\n\"trew chronique of what passed at Killingworth, in Ardenn, when our\r\nSoveren Lord the Kynge kept ther his Fest of Seynt Michel: with ye\r\nmarveylous accident that there befell at the solempnissacion of the\r\nmarriage of Gaston de Blondeville.  With divers things curious to be\r\nknown thereunto purtayning.  With an account of the grete Turney there\r\nheld in the year MCCLVI.  Changed out of the Norman tongue by Grymbald,\r\nMonk of Senct Marie Priori in Killingworth.\"  Chatterton's forgeries had\r\nby this time familiarized the public with imitations of early English.\r\nThe finder of this manuscript pretends to publish a modernized version of\r\nit, while endeavoring \"to preserve somewhat of the air of the old style.\"\r\nThis he does by a poor reproduction, not of thirteenth-century, but of\r\nsixteenth-century English, consisting chiefly in inversions of phrase and\r\nthe occasional use of a _certes_ or _naithless_.  Two words in particular\r\nseem to have struck Mrs. Radcliffe as most excellent archaisms: _ychon_\r\nand _his-self_, which she introduces at every turn.\r\n\r\n\"Gaston de Blondville,\" then, is a tale of the time of Henry III.  The\r\nking himself is a leading figure and so is Prince Edward.  Other\r\nhistorical personages are brought in, such as Simon de Montfort and Marie\r\nde France, but little use is made of them.  The book is not indeed, in\r\nany sense, an historical novel like Scott's \"Kenilworth,\" the scene of\r\nwhich is the same, and which was published in 1821, five years before\r\nMrs. Radcliffe's.  The story is entirely fictitious.  What differences it\r\nfrom her other romances is the conscious attempt to portray feudal\r\nmanners.  There are elaborate descriptions of costumes, upholstery,\r\narchitecture, heraldic bearings, ancient military array, a tournament, a\r\nroyal hunt, a feast in the great hall at Kenilworth, a visit of state to\r\nWarwick Castle, and the session of a baronial court.  The ceremony of the\r\n\"voide,\" when the king took his spiced cup, is rehearsed with a painful\r\naccumulation of particulars.  For all this she consulted Leland's\r\n\"Collectanea,\" Warton's \"History of English Poetry,\" the \"Household Book\r\nof Edward IV.,\" Pegge's \"Dissertation on the Obsolete Office of Esquire\r\nof the King's Body,\" the publications of the Society of Antiquaries and\r\nsimilar authorities, with results that are infinitely tedious.  Walter\r\nScott's archaeology is not always correct, nor his learning always\r\nlightly borne; but, upon the whole, he had the art to make his cumbrous\r\nmaterials contributory to his story rather than obstructive of it.\r\n\r\nIn these two novels we meet again all the familiar apparatus of secret\r\ntrap-doors, sliding panels, spiral staircases in the thickness of the\r\nwalls, subterranean vaults conducting to a neighboring priory or a cavern\r\nin the forest, ranges of deserted apartments where the moon looks in\r\nthrough mullioned casements, ruinous turrets around which the night winds\r\nmoan and howl.  Here, too, once more are the wicked uncle who seizes upon\r\nthe estates of his deceased brother's wife, and keeps her and her\r\ndaughter shut up in his dungeon for the somewhat long period of eighteen\r\nyears; the heroine who touches her lute and sings in pensive mood, till\r\nthe notes steal to the ear of the young earl imprisoned in the adjacent\r\ntower; the maiden who is carried off on horseback by bandits, till her\r\nshrieks bring ready aid; the peasant lad who turns out to be the baron's\r\nheir.  \"His surprise was great when the baroness, reviving, fixed her\r\neyes mournfully upon him and asked him to uncover his arm.\"  Alas! the\r\nsurprise is not shared by the reader, when \"'I have indeed found my\r\nlong-lost child: that strawberry,'\"[27] etc., etc.  \"Gaston de\r\nBlondville\" has a ghost--not explained away in the end according to Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe's custom.  It is the spirit of Reginald de Folville, Knight\r\nHospitaller of St. John, murdered in the Forest of Arden by Gaston de\r\nBlondville and the prior of St. Mary's.  He is a most robust apparition,\r\nand is by no means content with revisiting the glimpses of the moon, but\r\ngoes in and out at all hours of the day, and so often as to become\r\nsomewhat of a bore.  He ultimately destroys both first and second\r\nmurderer: one in his cell, the other in open tournament, where his\r\nexploits as a mysterious knight in black armor may have given Scott a\r\nhint for his black knight at the lists of Ashby-de-la-Zouche in \"Ivanhoe\"\r\n(1819).  His final appearance is in the chamber of the king, with whom he\r\nholds quite a long conversation.  \"The worm is my sister,\" he says: \"the\r\nmist of death is on me.  My bed is in darkness.  The prisoner is\r\ninnocent.  The prior of St. Mary's is gone to his account.  Be warned.\"\r\nIt is not explained why Mrs. Radcliffe refrained from publishing this\r\nlast romance of hers.  Perhaps she recognized that it was belated and\r\nthat the time for that sort of thing had gone by.  By 1802 Lewis' \"Monk\"\r\nwas in print, as well as several translations from German romances;\r\nScott's early ballads were out, and Coleridge's \"Ancient Mariner.\"  That\r\nvery year saw the publication of the \"Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border.\"\r\nBy 1826 the Waverley novels had made all previous fiction of the Gothic\r\ntype hopelessly obsolete.  In 1834 two volumes of her poems were given to\r\nthe world, including a verse romance in eight cantos, \"St. Alban's\r\nAbbey,\" and the verses scattered through her novels.  By this time Scott\r\nand Coleridge were dead; Byron, Shelley, and Keats had been dead for\r\nyears, and Mrs. Radcliffe's poesies fell upon the unheeding ears of a new\r\ngeneration.  A sneer in \"Waverley\" (1814) at the \"Mysteries of Udolpho\"\r\nhad hurt her feelings;[28] but Scott made amends in the handsome things\r\nwhich he said of her in his \"Lives of the Novelists.\"  It is interesting\r\nto note that when the \"Mysteries\" was issued, the venerable Joseph Warton\r\nwas so much entranced that he sat up the greater part of the night to\r\nfinish it.\r\n\r\nThe warfare between realism and romance, which went on in the days of\r\nCervantes, as it does in the days of Zola and Howells, had its skirmished\r\nalso in Mrs. Radcliffe's time.  Jane Austen's \"Northanger Abbey,\" written\r\nin 1803 but published only in 1817, is gently satirical of Gothic\r\nfiction.  The heroine is devoted to the \"Mysteries of Udolpho,\" which she\r\ndiscusses with her bosom friend.  \"While I have 'Udolpho' to read, I feel\r\nas if nobody could make me miserable.  O the dreadful black veil!  My\r\ndear Isabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina's skeleton behind it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you have finished 'Udolpho,'\" replies Isabella, \"we will read 'The\r\nItalian' together; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of\r\nthe same kind for you. . .  I will read you their names directly.  Here\r\nthey are in my pocket-book.  'Castle of Wolfenbach,' 'Clermont,'\r\n'Mysterious Warnings,' 'Necromancer of the Black Forest,' 'Midnight\r\nBell,' 'Orphan of the Rhine,' and 'Horrid Mysteries.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen introduced to her friend's brother, Miss Morland asks him at once,\r\n\"Have you ever read 'Udolpho,' Mr. Thorpe?\"  But Mr. Thorpe, who is not a\r\nliterary man, but much given to dogs and horses, assures her that he\r\nnever reads novels; they are \"full of nonsense and stuff; there has not\r\nbeen a tolerably decent one come out since 'Tom Jones,' except the\r\n'Monk.'\"  The scenery about Bath reminds Miss Morland of the south of\r\nFrance and \"the country that Emily and her father traveled through in the\r\n'Mysteries of Udolpho.'\"  She is enchanted at the prospect of a drive to\r\nBlaize Castle, where she hopes to have \"the happiness of being stopped in\r\ntheir way along narrow, winding vaults by a low, grated door; or even of\r\nhaving their lamp--their only lamp--extinguished by a sudden gust of wind\r\nand of being left in total darkness.\"  She visits her friends, the\r\nTilneys, at their country seat, Northanger Abbey, in Glouchestershire;\r\nand, on the way thither, young Mr. Tilney teases her with a fancy sketch\r\nof the Gothic horrors which she will unearth there: the \"sliding panels\r\nand tapestry\"; the remote and gloomy guest chamber, which will be\r\nassigned her, with its ponderous chest and its portrait of a knight in\r\narmor: the secret door, with massy bars and padlocks, that she will\r\ndiscover behind the arras, leading to a \"small vaulted room,\" and\r\neventually to a \"subterraneous communication between your apartment and\r\nthe chapel of St. Anthony scarcely two miles off.\"  Arrived at the abbey,\r\nshe is disappointed at the modern appearance of her room, but contrives\r\nto find a secret drawer in an ancient ebony cabinet, and in this a roll\r\nof yellow manuscript which, on being deciphered, proves to be a washing\r\nbill.  She is convinced, notwithstanding, that a mysterious door at the\r\nend of a certain gallery conducts to a series of isolated chambers where\r\nGeneral Tilney, who is supposed to be a widower, is keeping his unhappy\r\nwife immured and fed on bread and water.  When she finally gains\r\nadmission to this Bluebeard's chamber and finds it nothing but a suite of\r\nmodern rooms, \"the visions of romance were over. . .  Charming as were\r\nall Mrs. Radcliffe's works, and charming even as were the works of all\r\nher imitators, it was not in them, perhaps, that human nature, at least\r\nin the midland counties of England was to be looked for.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] But compare the passage last quoted with the one from Warton's essay\r\n_ante_, p. 219.\r\n\r\n[2] See _ante_, p. 49.\r\n\r\n[3] _Spectator_, No. 62.\r\n\r\n[4] See _ante_, p. 211.\r\n\r\n[5] \"Works of Richard Owen Cambridge,\" pp. 198-99.

What scholars and professional men of\r\nletters had sought to do by their imitations of Spenser and Milton, and\r\ntheir domestication of the Gothic and the Celtic muse, was much more\r\neffectually done by Percy and the ballad collectors.  What they had\r\nsought to do was to recall British poetry to the walks of imagination and\r\nto older and better models than Dryden and Pope.  But they could not jump\r\noff their own shadows: the eighteenth century was too much for them.\r\nWhile they anxiously cultivated wildness and simplicity, their diction\r\nremained polished, literary, academic to a degree.  It is not, indeed,\r\nuntil we reach the boundaries of a new century that we encounter a Gulf\r\nStream of emotional, creative impulse strong enough and hot enough to\r\nthaw the classical icebergs till not a floating spiculum of them is left.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, there occurred a revivifying contact with one\r\ndepartment, at least, of early verse literature, which did much to clear\r\nthe way for Scott and Coleridge and Keats.  The decade from 1760 to 1770\r\nis important in the history of English romanticism, and its most\r\nimportant title is Thomas Percy's \"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry:\r\nConsisting of Old Heroic Ballads, Songs, and Other Pieces of our Earlier\r\nPoets,\" published in three volumes in 1765.  It made a less immediate and\r\nexciting impression upon contemporary Europe than MacPherson's \"Poems of\r\nOssian,\" but it was more fruitful in enduring results.  The Germans make\r\na convenient classification of poetry into _Kunstpoesie_ and\r\n_Volkspoesie_, terms which may be imperfectly translated as literary\r\npoetry and popular poetry.  The English _Kunstpoesie_ of the Middle Ages\r\nlay buried under many superincumbent layers of literary fashion.\r\nOblivion had overtaken Gower and Occleve, and Lydgate and Stephen Hawes,\r\nand Skelton, and Henryson and James I. of Scotland, and well-nigh Chaucer\r\nhimself--all the mediaeval poetry of the schools, in short.  But it was\r\nknown to the curious that there was still extant a large body of popular\r\npoetry in the shape of narrative ballads, which had been handed down\r\nchiefly by oral transmission, and still lived in the memories and upon\r\nthe lips of the common people.  Many of these went back in their original\r\nshapes to the Middle Ages, or to an even remoter antiquity, and belonged\r\nto that great store of folk-lore which was the common inheritance of the\r\nAryan race.  Analogues and variants of favorite English and Scottish\r\nballads have been traced through almost all the tongues of modern Europe.\r\nDanish literature is especially rich in ballads and affords valuable\r\nillustrations of our native ministrelsy.[1]  It was, perhaps, due in part\r\nto the Danish settlements in Northumbria and to the large Scandinavian\r\nadmixture in the Northumbrian blood and dialect, that \"the north\r\ncountrie\" became _par excellence_ the ballad land: Lowland\r\nScotland--particularly the Lothians--and the English bordering counties,\r\nNorthumberland, Westmoreland, and Cumberland; with Yorkshire and\r\nNottinghamshire, in which were Barndale and Sherwood Forests, Robin\r\nHood's haunts.  It is not possible to assign exact dates to these songs.\r\nThey were seldom reduced to writing till many years after they were\r\ncomposed.  In the Middle Ages they were sung to the harp by wandering\r\nminstrels.  In later times they were chanted or recited by ballad-singers\r\nat fairs, markets, ale-houses, street-corners, sometimes to the\r\naccompaniment of a fiddle or crowd.  They were learned by ancient dames,\r\nwho repeated them in chimney corners to children and grandchildren.  In\r\nthis way some of them were preserved in an unwritten state, even to the\r\npresent day, in the tenacious memory of the people, always at bottom\r\nconservative and, under a hundred changes of fashion in the literary\r\npoetry which passes over their heads, clinging obstinately to old songs\r\nand beliefs learned in childhood, and handing them on to posterity.\r\nWalter Scott got much of the material for his \"Ministrelsy of the Border\"\r\nfrom the oral recitation of pipers, shepherds, and old women in Ettrick\r\nForest.  Professor Child's--the latest and fullest ballad\r\ncollection--contains pieces never before given in print or manuscript,\r\nsome of them obtained in America![2]\r\n\r\nLeading this subterranean existence, and generally thought unworthy the\r\nnotice of educated people, they naturally underwent repeated changes; so\r\nthat we have numerous versions of the same story, and incidents,\r\ndescriptions, and entire stanzas are borrowed and lent freely among the\r\ndifferent ballads.  The circumstance, _e.g._, of the birk and the briar\r\nspringing from the graves of true lovers and intertwisting their branches\r\noccurs in the ballads of \"Fair Margaret and Sweet William,\" \"Lord Thomas\r\nand Fair Annet,\" \"Lord Lovel,\" \"Fair Janet,\" and many others.  The knight\r\nwho was carried to fairyland through an entrance in a green hillside, and\r\nabode seven years with the queen of fairy, recurs in \"Tam Lin,\" \"Thomas\r\nRymer,\"[3] etc.  Like all folk-songs, these ballads are anonymous and may\r\nbe regarded not as the composition of any one poet, but as the property,\r\nand in a sense the work, of the people as a whole.  Coming out of an\r\nuncertain past, based on some dark legend of heart-break or blood-shed,\r\nthey bear no author's name, but are _ferae naturae_ and have the flavor\r\nof wild game.  They were common stock, like the national speech; everyone\r\ncould contribute toward them: generations of nameless poets, minstrels,\r\nballad-singers modernized their language to suit new times, altered their\r\ndialect to suit new places, accommodated their details to different\r\naudiences, English or Scotch, and in every way that they thought fit\r\nadded, retrenched, corrupted, improved, and passed them on.\r\n\r\nFolk-poetry is conventional; it seems to be the production of a guild,\r\nand to have certain well understood and commonly expected tricks of style\r\nand verse.  Freshness and sincerity are almost always attributes of the\r\npoetry of heroic ages, but individuality belongs to a high civilization\r\nand an advanced literary culture.  Whether the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\"\r\nare the work of one poet or of a cycle of poets, doubtless the rhetorical\r\npeculiarities of the Homeric epics, such as the recurrent phrase and the\r\nconventional epithet (the rosy-fingered dawn, the well-greaved Greeks,\r\nthe swift-footed Achilles, the much-enduring Odysseus, etc.) are due to\r\nthis communal or associative character of ancient heroic song.  As in the\r\ncompanies of architects who built the mediaeval cathedrals, or in the\r\nschools of early Italian painters, masters and disciples, the manner of\r\nthe individual artist was subdued to the tradition of his craft.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English and Scottish popular ballads are in various simple stanza\r\nforms, the commonest of all being the old _septenarius_ or \"fourteener,\"\r\narranged in a four-lined stanza of alternate eights and sixes, thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Up then crew the red, red cock,\r\n      And up and crew the gray;\r\n    The eldest to the youngest said\r\n      ''Tis time we were away.'\"[4]\r\n\r\nThis is the stanza usually employed by modern ballad imitators, like\r\nColeridge in \"The Ancient Mariner,\" Scott in \"Jock o' Hazeldean,\"\r\nLongfellow in \"The Wreck of the Hesperus,\" Macaulay in the \"Lays of\r\nAncient Rome,\" Aytoun in the \"Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers.\"  Many of\r\nthe stylistic and metrical peculiarities of the ballads arose from the\r\nfact that they were made to be sung or recited from memory.  Such are\r\nperhaps the division of the longer ones into fits, to rest the voice of\r\nthe singer; and the use of the burden or refrain for the same purpose, as\r\nalso to give the listeners and bystanders a chance to take up the chorus,\r\nwhich they probably accompanied with a few dancing steps.[5]  Sometimes\r\nthe burden has no meaning in itself and serves only to mark time with a\r\n_Hey derry down_ or an _O lilly lally_ and the like.  Sometimes it has\r\nmore or less reference to the story, as in \"The Two Sisters\":\r\n\r\n    \"He has ta'en three locks o' her yellow hair--\r\n      Binnorie, O Binnorie--\r\n    And wi' them strung his harp sae rare--\r\n      By the bonnie mill-dams of Binnorie.\"\r\n\r\nAgain it has no discoverable relation to the context, as in \"Riddles\r\nWisely Expounded\"--\r\n\r\n    \"There was a knicht riding frae the east--\r\n      _Jennifer gentle and rosemarie_--\r\n    Who had been wooing at monie a place--\r\n      _As the dew flies over the mulberry tree._\"\r\n\r\nBoth kinds of refrain have been liberally employed by modern balladists.\r\nThus Tennyson in \"The Sisters\":\r\n\r\n    \"We were two sisters of one race,\r\n      _The wind is howling in turret and tree;_\r\n_    _She was the fairer in the face,\r\n      _O the earl was fair to see.\"_\r\n\r\nWhile Rossetti and Jean Ingelow and others have rather favored the\r\ninconsequential burden, an affectation travestied by the late Mr. C. S.\r\nCalverley:\r\n\r\n    \"The auld wife sat at her ivied door,\r\n      (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese)\r\n    A thing she had frequently done before;\r\n      And her spectacles lay on her aproned knees.\r\n\r\n    \"The farmer's daughter hath soft brown hair\r\n      (Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese),\r\n    And I met with a ballad, I can't say where,\r\n      Which wholly consisted of lines like these.\"[6]\r\n\r\nA musical or mnemonic device akin to the refrain was that sing-song\r\nspecies of repetend so familiar in ballad language:\r\n\r\n    \"She had na pu'd a double rose,\r\n      a rose but only twa.\"\r\n\r\n    \"They had na sailed a league, a league,\r\n      A league but barely three.\r\n\r\n    \"How will I come up?  How can I come up?\r\n      How can I come to thee?\"\r\n\r\nAn answer is usually returned in the identical words of the question; and\r\nas in Homer, a formula of narration or a commonplace of description does\r\nduty again and again.  Iteration in the ballads is not merely for\r\neconomy, but stands in lieu of the metaphor and other figures of literary\r\npoetry:\r\n\r\n    \"'O Marie, put on your robes o' black,\r\n      Or else your robes o' brown,\r\n    For ye maun gang wi' me the night,\r\n      To see fair Edinbro town.'\r\n\r\n    \"'I winna put on my robes o' black,\r\n      Nor yet my robes o' brown;\r\n    But I'll put on my robes o' white,\r\n      To shine through Edinbro town.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother mark of the genuine ballad manner, as of Homer and _Volkspoesie_\r\nin general, is the conventional epithet.  Macaulay noted that the gold is\r\nalways red in the ballads, the ladies always gay, and Robin Hood's men\r\nare always his merry men.  Doughty Douglas, bold Robin Hood, merry\r\nCarlisle, the good greenwood, the gray goose wing, and the wan water are\r\nother inseparables of the kind.  Still another mark is the frequent\r\nretention of the Middle English accent on the final syllable in words\r\nlike contrié, barón, dinére, felàwe, abbày, rivére, monéy, and its\r\nassumption by words which never properly had it, such as ladý, harpér,\r\nweddíng, watér, etc.[7]  Indeed, as Percy pointed out in his\r\nintroduction, there were \"many phrases and idioms which the minstrels\r\nseem to have appropriated to themselves, . . . a cast of style and\r\nmeasure very different from that of contemporary poets of a higher class.\"\r\n\r\nNot everything that is called a ballad belongs to the class of poetry\r\nthat we are here considering.  In its looser employment the word has\r\nsignified almost any kind of song: \"a woeful ballad made to his mistress'\r\neyebrow,\" for example.  \"Ballade\" was also the name of a somewhat\r\nintricate French stanza form, employed by Gower and Chaucer, and recently\r\nreintroduced into English verse by Dobson, Lang, Goose, and others, along\r\nwith the virelay, rondeau, triolet, etc.  There is also a numerous class\r\nof popular ballads--in the sense of something made _for_ the people,\r\nthough not _by_ the people--are without relation to our subject.  These\r\nare the street ballads, which were and still are hawked about by\r\nballad-mongers, and which have no literary character whatever.  There are\r\nsatirical and political ballads, ballads versifying passages in Scripture\r\nor chronicle, ballads relating to current events, or giving the history\r\nof famous murders and other crimes, of prodigies, providences, and all\r\nsorts of happenings that teach a lesson in morals: about George Barnwell\r\nand the \"Babes in the Wood,\" and \"Whittington and his Cat,\" etc.: ballads\r\nlike Shenstone's \"Jemmy Dawson\" and Gay's \"Black-eyed Susan.\"  Thousands\r\nof such are included in manuscript collections like the \"Pepysian,\" or\r\nprinted in the publications of the Roxburghe Club and the Ballad Society.\r\nBut whether entirely modern, or extant in black-letter broadsides, they\r\nare nothing to our purpose.  We have to do here with the folk-song, the\r\n_traditional_ ballad, product of the people at a time when the people was\r\nhomogeneous and the separation between the lettered and unlettered\r\nclasses had not yet taken place: the true minstrel ballad of the Middle\r\nAges, or of that state of society which in rude and primitive\r\nneighborhoods, like the Scottish border, prolonged mediaeval conditions\r\nbeyond the strictly mediaeval period.\r\n\r\nIn the form in which they are preserved, a few of our ballads are older\r\nthan the seventeenth or the latter part of the sixteenth century, though\r\nin their origin many of them are much older.  Manuscript versions of\r\n\"Robin Hood and the Monk\" and \"Robin Hood and the Potter\" exist, which\r\nare referred to the last years of the fifteenth century.  The \"Lytel\r\nGeste of Robyn Hode\" was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1489.  The\r\n\"Not-Brown Maid\" was printed in \"Arnold's Chronicle\" in 1502.  \"The\r\nHunting of the Cheviot\"--the elder version of \"Chevy Chase\"--was\r\nmentioned by Philip Sidney in his \"Defence of Poesie\" in 1850.[8]  The\r\nballad is a narrative song, naïve, impersonal, spontaneous, objective.\r\nThe singer is lost in the song, the teller in the tale.  That is its\r\nessence, but sometimes the story is told by the lyrical, sometimes by the\r\ndramatic method.  In \"Helen of Kirkconnell\" it is the bereaved lover who\r\nis himself the speaker: in \"Waly Waly,\" the forsaken maid.  These are\r\nmonologues; for a purely dialogue ballad it will be sufficient to mention\r\nthe power and impressive piece in the \"Reliques\" entitled \"Edward.\"\r\nHerder translated this into German; it is very old, with Danish, Swedish,\r\nand Finnish analogues.  It is a story of parricide, and is narrated in a\r\nseries of questions by the mother and answers by the son.  The commonest\r\nform, however, was a mixture of epic and dramatic, or direct relation\r\nwith dialogue.  A frequent feature is the abruptness of the opening and\r\nthe translations.  The ballad-maker observes unconsciously Aristotle's\r\nrule for the epic poet, to begin _in medias res_.  Johnson noticed this\r\nin the instance of \"Johnny Armstrong,\" but a stronger example is found in\r\n\"The Banks of Yarrow:\"\r\n\r\n    \"Late at e'en, drinking the wine,\r\n      And ere they paid the lawing,\r\n    They set a combat them between,\r\n      To fight it in the dawing.\"\r\n\r\nWith this, an indirect, allusive way of telling the story, which Goethe\r\nmentions in his prefatory note to \"Des Sängers Fluch,\" as a constant note\r\nof the \"Volkslied.\"  The old ballad-maker does not vouchsafe explanations\r\nabout persons and motives; often he gives the history, not expressly nor\r\nfully, but by hints and glimpses, leaving the rest to conjecture;\r\nthrowing up its salient points into a strong, lurid light against a\r\nbackground of shadows.  The knight rides out a-hunting, and by and by his\r\nriderless horse comes home, and that is all:\r\n\r\n    \"Toom[9] hame cam the saddle\r\n      But never cam he.\"\r\n\r\nOr the knight himself comes home and lies down to die, reluctantly\r\nconfessing, under his mother's questioning, that he dined with his\r\ntrue-love and is poisoned.[10]  And again that is all.  Or\r\n\r\n    \"--In behint yon auld fail[11] dyke,\r\n    I wot there lies a new-slain knight;\r\n    And naebody kens that he lies there,\r\n    But his hawk, his hound, and lady fair.\r\n\r\n    \"His hound is to the hunting game,\r\n    His hawk to fetch the wild-fowl hame,\r\n    His lady's ta'en another mate,\r\n    So we may mak our dinner sweet.\"\r\n\r\nA whole unuttered tragedy of love, treachery, and murder lies back of\r\nthese stanzas.  This method of narration may be partly accounted for by\r\nthe fact that the story treated was commonly some local country-side\r\nlegend of family feud or unhappy passion, whose incidents were familiar\r\nto the ballad-singer's audience and were readily supplied by memory.  One\r\ntheory holds that the story was partly told and partly sung, and that the\r\nlinks and expositions were given in prose.  However this may be, the\r\nartless art of these popular poets evidently included a knowledge of the\r\nuses of mystery and suggestion.  They knew that, for the imagination, the\r\npart is sometimes greater than the whole.  Gray wrote to Mason in 1757,\r\n\"I have got the old Scotch ballad [Gil Maurice] on which 'Douglas'\r\n[Home's tragedy, first played at Edinburgh in 1756] was founded.  It is\r\ndivine. . .  Aristotle's best rules are observed in it in a manner which\r\nshews the author never had heard of Aristotle.  It begins in the fifth\r\nact of the play.  You may read it two-thirds through without guessing\r\nwhat it is about; and yet, when you come to the end, it is impossible not\r\nto understand the whole story.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to recover the conditions under which these folk-songs\r\n\"made themselves,\"[12] as it were, or grew under the shaping hands of\r\ngenerations of nameless bards.  Their naïve, primitive quality cannot be\r\nacquired: the secret is lost.  But Walter Scott, who was steeped to the\r\nlips in balladry, and whose temper had much of the healthy objectivity of\r\nan earlier age, has succeeded as well as any modern.  Some of his ballads\r\nare more perfect artistically than his long metrical romances; those of\r\nthem especially which are built up from a burden or fragment of old\r\nminstrel song, like \"Jock o' Hazeldean\"[13] and the song in \"Rokeby\":\r\n\r\n    \"He turned his charger as he spake\r\n      Upon the river shore,\r\n    He gave the bride-reins a shake,\r\n      Said 'Adieu for evermore,\r\n            My love!\r\n    And adieu for evermore!'\"\r\n\r\nHere Scott catches the very air of popular poetry, and the dovetailing is\r\ndone with most happy skill.  \"Proud Maisie is in the Wood\" is a fine\r\nexample of the ballad manner of story-telling by implication.[14]\r\n\r\nAs regards their subject-matter, the ballads admit of a rough\r\nclassification into the historical, or _quasi_-historical, and the purely\r\nlegendary or romantic.  Of the former class were the \"riding-ballad\" of\r\nthe Scottish border, where the forays of moss-troopers, the lifting of\r\nblackmail, the raids and private warfare of the Lords of the Marches,\r\nsupplied many traditions of heroism and adventure like those recorded in\r\n\"The Battle of Otterburn,\" \"The Hunting of the Cheviot,\" \"Johnnie\r\nArmstrong,\" \"Kinmont Willie,\" \"The Rising in the North\" and\r\n\"Northumberland Betrayed by Douglas.\"  Of the fictitious class, some were\r\nshortened, popularized, and generally degraded versions of the chivalry\r\nromances, which were passing out of favor among educated readers in the\r\nsixteenth century and fell into the hands of the ballad-makers.  Such, to\r\nname only a few included in the \"Reliques,\" were \"Sir Lancelot du Lake,\"\r\n\"The Legend of Sir Guy,\" \"King Arthur's Death\" and \"The Marriage of Sir\r\nGawaine.\"  But the substance of these was not of the genuine popular\r\nstuff, and their personages were simply the old heroes of court poetry in\r\nreduced circumstances.  Much more impressive are the original folk-songs,\r\nwhich strike their roots deep into the ancient world of legend and even\r\nof myth.\r\n\r\nIn this true ballad world there is a strange commingling of paganism and\r\nCatholic Christianity.  It abounds in the supernatural and the marvelous.\r\nRobin Hood is a pious outlaw.  He robs the fat-headed monks, but will not\r\ndie unhouseled and has great devotion to Our Blessed Lady; who appears\r\nalso to Brown Robyn, when he is cast overboard, hears his confession and\r\ntakes his soul to Heaven.[15]  When mass has been sung and the bells of\r\nmerry Lincoln have rung, Lady Maisry goes seeking her little Hugh, who\r\nhas been killed by the Jew's daughter and thrown into Our Lady's\r\ndraw-well fifty fathom deep, and the boy answers his mother miraculously\r\nfrom the well.[16]  Birds carry messages for lovers[17] and dying\r\nmen,[18] or show the place where the body lies buried and the\r\ncorpse-candles shine.[19]  The harper strings his harp with three golden\r\nhairs of the drowned maiden, and the tune that he plays upon them reveals\r\nthe secret of her death.[20]  The ghosts of the sons that have perished\r\nat sea come home to take farewell of their mother.[21]  The spirit of the\r\nforsaken maid visits her false lover at midnight;[22] or \"the dead comes\r\nfor the quick,\"[23] as in Burger's weird poem.  There are witches,\r\nfairies, and mermaidens[24] in the ballads: omens, dreams, spells,[25]\r\nenchantments, transformations,[26] magic rings and charms, \"gramarye\"[27]\r\nof many sorts; and all these things are more effective here than in poets\r\nlike Spenser and Collins, because they are matters of belief and not of\r\nmake-believe.\r\n\r\nThe ballads are prevailingly tragical in theme, and the tragic passions\r\nof pity and fear find an elementary force of utterance.  Love is strong\r\nas death, jealousy cruel as the grave.  Hate, shame, grief, despair speak\r\nhere with their native accent:\r\n\r\n    \"There are seven forsters at Pickeram Side,\r\n      At Pickeram where they dwell,\r\n    And for a drop of thy heart's bluid\r\n      They wad ride the fords of hell.\"[28]\r\n\r\n    \"O little did my mother think,\r\n      The day she cradled me,\r\n    What lands I was to travel through,\r\n      What death I was to dee.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThe maiden asks her buried lover:\r\n\r\n    \"Is there any room at your head, Sanders?\r\n      Is there any room at your feet?\r\n    Or any room at your twa sides,\r\n      Where fain, fain would I sleep?\"[30]\r\n\r\n    \"O waly, waly, but love be bonny\r\n      A little time while it is new;[31]\r\n    But when 'tis auld it waxeth cauld\r\n      And fades awa' like morning dew. . .\r\n\r\n    \"And O! if my young babe were born,\r\n      And set upon the nurse's knee,\r\n    And I mysel' were dead and gane,\r\n      And the green grass growing over me!\"\r\n\r\nManners in this world are of a primitive savagery.  There are treachery,\r\nviolence, cruelty, revenge; but there are also honor, courage, fidelity,\r\nand devotion that endureth to the end. \"Child Waters\" and \"Fair Annie\" do\r\nnot suffer on a comparison with Tennyson's \"Enid\" and Chaucer's story of\r\npatient Griselda (\"The Clerkes Tale\") with which they have a common\r\ntheme.  It is the medieval world.  Marauders, pilgrims, and wandering\r\ngleemen go about in it.  The knight stands at his garden pale, the lady\r\nsits at her bower window, and the little foot page carries messages over\r\nmoss and moor.  Marchmen are riding through the Bateable Land \"by the hie\r\nlight o' the moon.\"  Monks are chanting in St. Mary's Kirk, trumpets are\r\nblowing in Carlisle town, castles are burning; down in the glen there is\r\nan ambush and swords are flashing; bows are twanging in the greenwood;\r\nfour and twenty ladies are playing at the ball, and four and twenty\r\nmilk-white calves are in the woods of Glentanner--all ready to be stolen.\r\nAbout Yule the round tables begin; the queen looks over the castle-wall,\r\nthe palmer returns from the Holy Land, Young Waters lies deep in Stirling\r\ndungeon, but Child Maurice is in the silver wood, combing his yellow\r\nlocks with a silver comb.\r\n\r\nThere is an almost epic coherence about the ballads of the Robin Hood\r\ncycle.  This good robber, who with his merry men haunted the forests of\r\nSherwood and Barnsdale, was the real ballad hero and the darling of the\r\npopular fancy which created him.  For though the names of his confessor,\r\nFriar Tuck; his mistress, Maid Marian; and his companions, Little John,\r\nScathelock, and Much the miller's son, have an air of reality,--and\r\nthough the tradition has associated itself with definite\r\nlocalities,--there is nothing historical about Robin Hood.  Langland, in\r\nthe fourteenth century, mentions \"rhymes of Robin Hood\"; and efforts have\r\nbeen made to identify him with one of the dispossessed followers of Simon\r\nde Montfort, in \"the Barons' War,\" or with some still earlier\r\nfree-booter, of Hereward's time, who had taken to the woods and lived by\r\nplundering the Normans.  Myth as he is, he is a thoroughly national\r\nconception.  He had the English love of fair play; the English readiness\r\nto shake hands and make up when worsted in a square fight.  He killed the\r\nKing's venison, but was a loyal subject.  He took from the rich and gave\r\nto the poor, executing thus a kind of wild justice.  He defied legal\r\nauthority in the person of the proud sheriff of Nottingham, thereby\r\nappealing to that secret sympathy with lawlessness which marks a\r\nvigorous, free yeomanry.[32]  He had the knightly virtues of courtesy and\r\nhospitality, and the yeomanly virtues of good temper and friendliness.\r\nAnd finally, he was a mighty archer with the national weapons, the\r\nlong-bow and the cloth-yard shaft; and so appealed to the national love\r\nof sport in his free and careless life under the greenwood tree.  The\r\nforest scenery give a poetic background to his exploits, and though the\r\nballads, like folk-poetry in general, seldom linger over natural\r\ndescriptions, there is everywhere a consciousness of this background and\r\na wholesome, outdoor feeling:\r\n\r\n    \"In somer, when the shawes be sheyne,\r\n      And leves be large and long,\r\n    Hit is full mery in feyre foreste\r\n      To here the foulys song:\r\n\r\n    \"To se the dere draw to the dale,\r\n      And leve the hillis hee,\r\n    And shadow hem in the levës grene,\r\n      Under the grene-wode tre.\"[33]\r\n\r\nAlthough a few favorite ballads such as \"Johnnie Armstrong,\" \"Chevy\r\nChase,\" \"The Children in the Wood,\" and some of the Robin Hood ones had\r\nlong been widely, nay almost universally familiar, they had hardly been\r\nregarded as literature worthy of serious attention.  They were looked\r\nupon as nursery tales, or at best as the amusement of peasants and\r\nunlettered folk, who used to paste them up on the walls of inns,\r\ncottages, and ale-houses.  Here and there an educated man had had a\r\nsneaking fondness for collecting old ballads--much as people nowadays\r\ncollect postage stamps.  Samuel Pepys, the diarist, made such a\r\ncollection, and so did John Selden, the great legal antiquary and scholar\r\nof Milton's time.  \"I have heard,\" wrote Addison, \"that the late Lord\r\nDorset, who had the greatest wit tempered with the greatest candor, and\r\nwas one of the finest critics as well as the best poets of his age, had a\r\nnumerous collection of old English ballads, and a particular pleasure in\r\nthe reading of them.  I can affirm the same of Mr. Dryden.\"  Dryden's\r\n\"Miscellany Poems\" (1684) gave \"Gilderoy,\" \"Johnnie Armstrong,\" \"Chevy\r\nChase,\" \"The Miller and the King's Daughter,\" and \"Little Musgrave and\r\nthe Lady Barnard.\"  The last named, as well as \"Lady Anne Bothwell's\r\nLament\" and \"Fair Margaret and Sweet William,\"[34] was quoted in Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher's \"Knight of the Burning Pestle,\" (1611).  Scraps of them\r\nare sung by one of the _dramatis personae_, old Merrythought, whose\r\nspeciality is a damnable iteration of ballad fragments.  References to\r\nold ballads are numerous in the Elizabethan plays.  Percy devoted the\r\nsecond book of his first series to \"Ballads that Illustrate Shakspere.\"\r\nIn the seventeenth century a few ballads were printed entire in poetic\r\nmiscellanies entitled \"Garlands,\" higgledy-piggledy with pieces of all\r\nkinds.  Professor Child enumerates nine ballad collections before\r\nPercy's.  The only ones of any importance among these were \"A Collection\r\nof Old Ballads\" (Vols I. and II. in 1723, Vol III. In 1725), ascribed to\r\nAmbrose Philips; and the Scotch poet, Allan Ramsay's, \"Tea Table\r\nMiscellany,\" (in 4 vols., 1714-40) and \"Evergreen\" (2 vols., 1724).  The\r\nfirst of these collections was illustrated with copperplate engravings\r\nand supplied with introductions which were humorous in intention.  The\r\neditor treated his ballads as trifles, though he described them as\r\n\"corrected from the best and most ancient copies extant\"; and said that\r\nHomer himself was nothing more than a blind ballad-singer, whose songs\r\nhad been subsequently joined together and formed into an epic poem.\r\nRamsay's ballads were taken in part from a manuscript collection of some\r\neight hundred pages, made by George Bannatyne about 1570 and still\r\npreserved in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nIn Nos. 70, 74, and 85, of the _Spectator_, Addison had praised the\r\nnaturalness and simplicity of the popular ballads, selecting for special\r\nmention \"Chevy Chase\"--the later version--\"which,\" he wrote, \"is the\r\nfavorite ballad of the common people of England; and Ben Jonson used to\r\nsay he had rather have been the author of it than of all his works\"; and\r\n\"the 'Two Children in the Wood,' which is one of the darling songs of the\r\ncommon people, and has been the delight of most Englishmen in some part\r\nof their age.\"  Addison justifies his liking for these humble poems by\r\nclassical precedents.  \"The greatest modern critics have laid it down as\r\na rule that an heroic poem should be founded upon some important precept\r\nof morality adapted to the constitution of the country in which the poet\r\nwrites.  Homer and Virgil have formed their plans in this view.\"\r\nAccordingly he thinks that the author of \"Chevy Chase\" meant to point a\r\nmoral as to the mischiefs of private war.  As if it were not precisely\r\nthe _gaudium certaminis_ that inspired the old border ballad-maker!  As\r\nif he did not glory in the fight!  The passage where Earl Percy took the\r\ndead Douglas by the hand and lamented his fallen foe reminds Addison of\r\nAeneas' behavior toward Lausus.  The robin red-breast covering the\r\nchildren with leaves recalls to his mind a similar touch in one of\r\nHorace's odes.  But it was much that Addison, whose own verse was so\r\nartificial, should have had a taste for the wild graces of folk-song.  He\r\nwas severely ridiculed by his contemporaries for these concessions.  \"He\r\ndescended now and then to lower disquisitions,\" wrote Dr. Johnson,\" and\r\nby a serious display of the beauties of 'Chevy Chase,' exposed himself to\r\nthe ridicule of Wagstaff, who bestowed a like pompous character on 'Tom\r\nThumb'; and to the contempt of Dennis, who, considering the fundamental\r\nposition of his criticism, that 'Chevy Chase' pleases and ought to please\r\nbecause it is natural, observes that 'there is a way of deviating from\r\nnature . . . by imbecility, which degrades nature by faintness and\r\ndiminution'. . .  In 'Chevy Chase' . . . there is a chill and lifeless\r\nimbecility.  The story cannot possibly be told in a manner that shall\r\nmake less impression on the mind.\"[35]\r\n\r\nNicholas Rowe, the dramatist and Shakspere editor, had said a good word\r\nfor ballads in the prologue to \"Jane Shore\" (1713):\r\n\r\n    \"Let no nice taste despise the hapless dame\r\n    Because recording ballads chant her name.\r\n    Those venerable ancient song enditers\r\n    Soared many a pitch above our modern writers. . .\r\n    Our numbers may be more refined than those,\r\n    But what we've gained in verse, we've lost in prose.\r\n    Their words no shuffling double meaning knew:\r\n    Their speech was homely, but their hearts were true. . .\r\n    With rough, majestic force they moved the heart,\r\n    And strength and nature made amends for art.\"\r\n\r\nBallad forgery had begun early.  To say nothing of appropriations, like\r\nMallet's, of \"William and Margaret,\" Lady Wardlaw put forth her\r\n\"Hardyknut\" in 1719 as a genuine old ballad, and it was reprinted as such\r\nin Ramsay's \"Evergreen.\"  Gray wrote to Walpole in 1760, \"I have been\r\noften told that the poem called 'Hardicanute' (which I always admired and\r\nstill admire) was the work of somebody that lived a few years ago.  This\r\nI do not at all believe, though it has evidently been retouched by some\r\nmodern hand.\"  Before Percy no concerted or intelligent effort had been\r\nmade toward collecting, preserving, and editing the _corpus poetarum_ of\r\nEnglish minstrelsy.  The great mass of ancient ballads, so far as they\r\nwere in print at all, existed in \"stall copies,\" _i.e._, single sheets of\r\nbroadsides, struck off for sale by balladmongers and the keepers of\r\nbook-stalls.\r\n\r\nThomas Percy, the compiler of the \"Reliques,\" was a parish clergyman,\r\nsettled at the retired hamlet of Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire.  For\r\nyears he had amused his leisure by collecting ballads.  He numbered among\r\nhis acquaintances men of letters like Johnson, Goldsmith, Garrick,\r\nGrainger, Farmer, and Shenstone.  It was the last who suggested the plan\r\nof the \"Reliques\" and who was to have helped in its execution, had not\r\nhis illness and death prevented.  Johnson spent a part of the summer of\r\n1764 on a visit to the vicarage of Easton Maudit, on which occasion Percy\r\nreports that his guest \"chose for his regular reading the old Spanish\r\nromance of 'Felixmarte of Hircania,' in folio, which he read quite\r\nthrough.\"  He adds, what one would not readily suspect, that the doctor,\r\nwhen a boy, \"was immoderately fond of reading romances of chivalry, and\r\nhe retained his fondness for them through life. . .  I have heard him\r\nattribute to these extravagant fictions that unsettled turn of mind which\r\nprevented his ever fixing in any profession.\"  Percy talked over his\r\nproject with Johnson, who would seem to have given his approval, and even\r\nto have added his persuasions to Shenstone's.  For in the preface to the\r\nfirst edition of the \"Reliques,\" the editor declared that \"he could\r\nrefuse nothing to such judges as the author of the _Rambler_ and the late\r\nMr. Shenstone\"; and that \"to the friendship of Mr. Johnson he owes many\r\nvaluable hints for the conduct of his work.\"  And after Ritson had\r\nquestioned the existence of the famous \"folio manuscript,\" Percy's nephew\r\nin the advertisement to the fourth edition (1794), cited \"the appeal\r\npublicly made to Dr. Johnson . . . so long since as in the year 1765, and\r\nnever once contradicted by him.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of these amenities, the doctor had a low opinion of ballads and\r\nballad collectors.  In the _Rambler_ (No. 177) he made merry over one\r\nCantilenus, who \"turned all his thoughts upon old ballads, for he\r\nconsidered them as the genuine records of the natural taste.  He offered\r\nto show me a copy of 'The Children in the Wood,' which he firmly believed\r\nto be of the first edition, and by the help of which the text might be\r\nfreed from several corruptions, if this age of barbarity had any claim to\r\nsuch favors from him.\"  \"The conversation,\" says Boswell, \"having turned\r\non modern imitations of ancient ballads, and someone having praised their\r\nsimplicity, he treated them with that ridicule which he always displayed\r\nwhen that subject was mentioned.\"  Johnson wrote several stanzas in\r\nparody of the ballads; _e.g._,\r\n\r\n    \"The tender infant, meek and mild,\r\n      Fell down upon a stone:\r\n    The nurse took up the squealing child,\r\n      But still the child squealed on.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n    \"I put my hat upon my head\r\n      And walked into the Strand;\r\n    And there I met another man\r\n      Whose hat was in his hand.\"\r\n\r\nThis is quoted by Wordsworth,[36] who compares it with a stanza from \"The\r\nChildren in the Wood\":\r\n\r\n    \"Those pretty babes, with hand in hand,\r\n      Went wandering up and down;\r\n    But never more they saw the man\r\n      Approaching from the town.\"\r\n\r\nHe says that in both of these stanzas the language is that of familiar\r\nconversation, yet one stanza is admirable and the other contemptible,\r\nbecause the _matter_ of it is contemptible.  In the essay supplementary\r\nto his preface, Wordsworth asserts that the \"Reliques\" was \"ill suited to\r\nthe then existing taste of city society, and Dr. Johnson . . . was not\r\nsparing in his exertions to make it an object of contempt\": and that \"Dr.\r\nPercy was so abashed by the ridicule flung upon his labors . . . that,\r\nthough while he was writing under a mask he had not wanted resolution to\r\nfollow his genius into the regions of true simplicity and genuine pathos\r\n(as is evinced by the exquisite ballad of 'Sir Cauline' and by many other\r\npieces), yet when he appeared in his own person and character as a\r\npoetical writer, he adopted, as in the tale of 'The Hermit of Warkworth,'\r\na diction scarcely distinguishable from the vague, the glossy and\r\nunfeeling language of his day.\"  Wordsworth adds that he esteems the\r\ngenius of Dr. Percy in this kind of writing superior to that of any other\r\nmodern writer; and that even Bürger had not Percy's fine sensibility.  He\r\nquotes, in support of this opinion, two stanzas from \"The Child of Elle\"\r\nin the \"Reliques,\" and contrasts them with the diluted and tricked-out\r\nversion of the same in Bürger's German.\r\n\r\nMr. Hales does not agree in this high estimate of Percy as a ballad\r\ncomposer.  Of this same \"Child of Elle\" he says: \"The present fragment of\r\na version may be fairly said to be now printed for the first time, as in\r\nthe 'Reliques' it is buried in a heap of 'polished' verses composed by\r\nPercy.  That worthy prelate, touched by the beauty of it--he had a\r\nsoul--was unhappily moved to try his hand at its completion.  A\r\nwax-doll-maker might as well try to restore Milo's Venus.  There are\r\nthirty-nine lines here.  There are two hundred in the thing called the\r\n'Child of Elle' in the 'Reliques.'  But in those two hundred lines all\r\nthe thirty-nine originals do not appear. . .  On the whole, the union of\r\nthe genuine and the false--of the old ballad with Percy's tawdry\r\nfeebleness--makes about as objectionable a _mésalliance_ as in the story\r\nitself is in the eyes of the father.\"[37]  The modern ballad scholars, in\r\ntheir zeal for the purity of the text, are almost as hard upon Percy as\r\nRitson himself was.  They say that he polished \"The Heir of Linne\" till\r\nhe could see his own face in it; and swelled out its 126 lines to 216--\"a\r\nfine flood of ballad and water.\"[38]  The result of this piecing and\r\ntinkering in \"Sir Cauline\"--which Wordsworth thought exquisite--they\r\nregard as a heap of tinsel, though they acknowledge that \"these\r\nadditional stanzas show, indeed, an extensive acquaintance with old\r\nballadry and a considerable talent of imitation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the critical or scholarly point of view, these strictures are\r\ndoubtless deserved.  It is an editor's duty to give his text as he finds\r\nit, without interpolations or restorations; and it is unquestionable that\r\nPercy's additions to fragmentary pieces are full of sentimentalism,\r\naffectation, and the spurious poetic diction of his age.  An experienced\r\nballad amateur can readily separate, in most cases, the genuine portions\r\nfrom the insertions.  But it is unfair to try Percy by modern editorial\r\ncanons.  That sacredness which is now imputed to the _ipsissima verba_ of\r\nan ancient piece of popular literature would have been unintelligible to\r\nmen of that generation, who regarded such things as trifles at best, and\r\nmostly as barbarous trifles--something like wampum belts, or nose-rings,\r\nor antique ornaments in the _goût barbare et charmant des bijoux goths_.\r\nPercy's readers did not want torsos and scraps; to present them with\r\nacephalous or bobtailed ballads--with _cetera desunt_ and constellations\r\nof asterisks--like the manuscript in Prior's poem, the conclusion of\r\nwhich was eaten by the rats--would have been mere pedantry.  Percy knew\r\nhis public, and he knew how to make his work attractive to it.  The\r\nreaders of that generation enjoyed their ballad with a large infusion of\r\nPercy.  If the scholars of this generation prefer to take theirs without,\r\nthey know where to get it.\r\n\r\nThe materials for the \"Reliques\" were drawn partly from the Pepys\r\ncollection at Magdalen College, Cambridge; from Anthony Wood's, made in\r\n1676, in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford; from manuscript and printed\r\nballads in the Bodleian, the British Museum, the archives of the\r\nAntiquarian Society, and private collections.  Sir David Dalrymple sent a\r\nnumber of Scotch ballads, and the editor acknowledged obligations to\r\nThomas Warton and many others.  But the nucleus of the whole was a\r\ncertain folio manuscript in a handwriting of Charles I.'s time,\r\ncontaining 191 songs and ballads, which Percy had begged, then still very\r\nyoung, from his friend Humphrey Pitt, of Prior's-Lee in Shropshire.  When\r\nhe first saw this precious document, it was torn, unbound, and mutilated,\r\n\"lying dirty on the floor under a bureau in the parlor, being used by the\r\nmaids to light the fire.\"  The first and last leaves were wanting, and\r\n\"of 54 pages near the beginning, half of every leaf hath been torn\r\naway.\"[39]  Percy had it bound, but the binders trimmed off the top and\r\nbottom lines in the process.  From this manuscript he professed to have\r\ntaken \"the greater part\" of the pieces in the \"Reliques.\"  In truth he\r\ntook only 45 of the 176 poems in his first edition from this source.\r\n\r\nPercy made no secret of the fact that he filled _lacunae_ in his\r\noriginals with stanzas, and, in some cases, with nearly entire poems of\r\nhis own composition.  But the extent of the liberties that he took with\r\nthe text, although suspected, was not certainly known until Mr. Furnivall\r\nfinally got leave to have the folio manuscript copied and printed.[40]\r\nBefore this time it had been jealously guarded by the Percy family, and\r\naccess to it had been denied to scholars.  \"Since Percy and his nephew\r\nprinted their fourth edition of the 'Reliques' from the manuscript in\r\n1794,\" writes Mr. Furnivall in his \"Forewords,\" \"no one has printed any\r\npiece from it except Robert Jamieson--to whom Percy supplied a copy of\r\n'Child Maurice' and 'Robin Hood and the Old Man' for his 'Popular Ballads\r\nand Songs' (1806)--and Sir Frederic Madden, who was allowed--by one of\r\nPercy's daughters--to print 'The Grene Knight,' 'The Carle of Carlisle'\r\nand 'The Turk and Gawin' in his 'Syr Gawaine' for the Bannatyne Club,\r\n1839.\"  Percy was furiously assailed by Joseph Ritson for manipulating\r\nhis texts; and in the 1794 edition he made some concessions to the\r\nlatter's demand for a literal rescript, by taking off a few of the\r\nornaments in which he had tricked them.  Ritson was a thoroughly\r\ncritical, conscientious student of poetic antiquities and held the right\r\ntheory of an editor's functions.  In his own collection of early English\r\npoetry he rendered a valuable service to all later inquiries.  These\r\nincluded \"Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry,\" 1791; \"Ancient Songs,\" 1792;\r\n\"Scottish Songs,\" 1794; \"Robin Hood,\" 1795; besides editions of Laurence\r\nMinot's poems, and of \"Gammer Gurton's Needle,\" as well as other titles.\r\nHe was an ill-tempered and eccentric man: a vegetarian, a free-thinker, a\r\nspelling reformer,[41] and latterly a Jacobin.  He attacked Warton as\r\nwell as Percy, and used to describe any clerical antagonist as a\r\n\"stinking priest.\"  He died insane in 1803.  Ritson took issue with the\r\ntheory maintained in Percy's introductory \"Essay on the Ancient\r\nMinstrels,\" viz.: that the minstrels were not only the singers, but\r\nlikewise the authors of the ballads.  But Ritson went so far in his rage\r\nagainst Percy as to deny the existence of the sacred Folio Manuscript,\r\nuntil convinced by abundant testimony that there was such a thing.  It\r\nwas an age of forgeries, and Ritson was not altogether without\r\njustification in supposing that the author of \"The Hermit of Warkworth\"\r\nbelonged in the same category with Chatterton, Ireland, and MacPherson.\r\n\r\nPercy, like Warton, took an apologetic tone toward his public.  \"In a\r\npolished age, like the present,\" he wrote, \"I am sensible that many of\r\nthese reliques of antiquity will require great allowances to be made for\r\nthem.  Yet have they, for the most part, a pleasing simplicity and many\r\nartless graces, which, in the opinion of no mean critics, have been\r\nthought to compensate for the want of higher beauties.\"  Indeed how\r\nshould it have been otherwise?  The old ballads were everything which the\r\neighteenth century was not.  They were rough and wild, where that was\r\nsmooth and tame; they dealt, with fierce sincerity, in the elementary\r\npassions of human nature.  They did not moralize, or philosophize, or\r\nsentimentalize; were never subtle, intellectual, or abstract.  They were\r\nplain English, without finery or elegance.  They had certain popular\r\nmannerisms, but none of the conventional figures of speech or rhetorical\r\nartifices like personifications, periphrasis, antithesis, and climax so\r\ndear to the Augustan heart.  They were intent on the story--not on the\r\nstyle--and they just told it and let it go for what it was worth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there are ballads and ballads.  The best of them are noble in\r\nexpression as well as feeling, unequaled by anything in our medieval\r\npoetry outside of Chaucer; unequaled by Chaucer himself in point of\r\nintensity, in occasional phrases of a piercing beauty:\r\n\r\n    \"The swans-fethers that his arrowe bar\r\n    With his hart-blood they were wet.\"[42]\r\n\r\n    \"O cocks are crowing a merry mid-larf,\r\n      A wat the wild fule boded day;\r\n    The salms of Heaven will be sung,\r\n      And ere now I'll be missed away.\"[43]\r\n\r\n    \"If my love were an earthly knight,\r\n      As he's an elfin gray,\r\n    A wad na gie my sin true love\r\n      For no lord that ye hae.\"[44]\r\n\r\n    \"She hang ae napkin at the door,\r\n      Another in the ha,\r\n    And a' to wipe the trickling tears,\r\n      Sae fast as they did fa.\"[45]\r\n\r\n    \"And all is with one chyld of yours,\r\n      I feel stir at my side:\r\n    My gowne of green, it is too strait:\r\n      Before it was too wide.\"[46]\r\n\r\nVerse of this quality needs no apology.  But of many of the ballads,\r\nDennis' taunt, repeated by Dr. Johnson, is true; they are not merely\r\nrude, but weak and creeping in style.  Percy knew that the best of them\r\nwould savor better to the palates of his contemporaries if he dressed\r\nthem with modern sauces.  Yet he must have loved them, himself, in their\r\nnative simplicity, and it seems almost incredible that he could have\r\nspoken as he did about Prior's insipid paraphrase of the \"Nut Brown\r\nMaid.\"  \"If it had no other merit,\" he says of that most lovely ballad,\r\n\"than the having afforded the ground-work to Prior's 'Henry and Emma,'\r\nthis ought to preserve it from oblivion.\"  Prior was a charming writer of\r\nepigram, society verse, and the humorous _conte_ in the manner of La\r\nFontaine; but to see how incapable he was of the depth and sweetness of\r\nromantic poetry, compare a few lines of the original with the \"hubbub of\r\nwords\" in his modernized version, in heroic couplets:\r\n\r\n    \"O Lord, what is this worldes blisse\r\n    That changeth as the mone!\r\n    The somer's day in lusty May\r\n    Is derked before the none.\r\n    I hear you say farewel.  Nay, nay,\r\n    We departe not so soon:\r\n    Why say ye so?  Wheder wyle ye goo?\r\n    Alas! what have ye done?\r\n    Alle my welfare to sorrow and care\r\n    Shulde change if ye were gon;\r\n    For in my minde, of all mankynde,\r\n    I love but you alone.\"\r\n\r\nNow hear Prior, with his Venus and flames and god of love:\r\n\r\n    \"What is our bliss that changeth with the moon,\r\n    And day of life that darkens ere 'tis noon?\r\n    What is true passion, if unblest it dies?\r\n    And where is Emma's joy, if Henry flies?\r\n    If love, alas! be pain, the pain I bear\r\n    No thought can figure and no tongue declare.\r\n    Ne'er faithful woman felt, nor false one feigned\r\n    The flames which long have in my bosom reigned.\r\n    The god of love himself inhabits there\r\n    With all his rage and dread and grief and care,\r\n    His complement of stores and total war,\r\n    O cease then coldly to suspect my love\r\n    And let my deed at least my faith approve.\r\n    Alas! no youth shall my endearments share\r\n    Nor day nor night shall interrupt my care;\r\n    No future story shall with truth upbraid\r\n    The cold indifference of the nut-brown maid;\r\n    Nor to hard banishment shall Henry run\r\n    While careless Emma sleeps on beds of down.\r\n    View me resolved, where'er thou lead'st, to go:\r\n    Friend to thy pain and partner of thy woe;\r\n    For I attest fair Venus and her son\r\n    That I, of all mankind, will love but thee alone.\"\r\n\r\nThere could be no more striking object lesson than this of the plethora\r\nfrom which English poetic diction was suffering, and of the sanative\r\nvalue of a book like the \"Reliques.\"\r\n\r\n\"To atone for the rudeness of the more obsolete poems,\" and \"to take off\r\nfrom the tediousness of the longer narratives,\" Percy interspersed a few\r\nmodern ballads and a large number of \"little elegant pieces of the lyric\r\nkind\" by Skelton, Hawes, Gascoigne, Raleigh, Marlowe, Shakspere, Jonson,\r\nWarner, Carew, Daniel, Lovelace, Suckling, Drayton, Beaumont and\r\nFletcher, Wotton, and other well-known poets.  Of the modern ballads the\r\nonly one with any resemblance to folk-poetry was \"The Braes o' Yarrow\" by\r\nWilliam Hamilton of Bangour, a Scotch gentleman who was \"out in the\r\nforty-five.\"  The famous border stream had watered an ancient land of\r\nsong and story, and Hamilton's ballad, with its \"strange, fugitive\r\nmelody,\" was not unworthy of its traditions.  Hamilton belongs to the\r\nMilton imitators by virtue of his octosyllabics \"Contemplation.\"[47]  His\r\n\"Braes o' Yarrow\" had been given already in Ramsey's \"Tea Table\r\nMiscellany,\" The opening lines--\r\n\r\n    \"Busk ye, busk ye, my bonny, bonny bride,\r\n      Busk ye, busk ye, my winsome marrow\"--\r\n\r\nare quoted in Wordsworth's \"Yarrow Unvisited,\" as well as a line of the\r\nfollowing stanza:\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet smells the birk, green grows, green grows the grass,\r\n      Yellow on Yarrow's bank the gowan:\r\n    Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,\r\n      Sweet the wave of Yarrow flowin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the \"Reliques\" included one acknowledged child of\r\nPercy's muse, \"The Friar of Orders Grey,\" a short, narrative ballad made\r\nup of song snatches from Shakspere's plays.  Later editions afforded his\r\nlonger poem, \"The Hermit of Warkworth,\" first published independently in\r\n1771.\r\n\r\nWith all its imperfections--perhaps partly in consequence of its\r\nimperfections--the \"Reliques\" was an epoch-making book.  The nature of\r\nits service to English letters is thus stated by Macaulay, in the\r\nintroduction to his \"Lays of Ancient Rome\": \"We cannot wonder that the\r\nballads of Rome should have altogether disappeared, when we remember how\r\nvery narrowly, in spite of the invention of printing, those of our own\r\ncountry and those of Spain escaped the same fate.  There is, indeed,\r\nlittle doubt that oblivion covers many English songs equal to any that\r\nwere published by Bishop Percy; and many Spanish songs as good as the\r\nbest of those which have been so happily translated by Mr. Lockhart.\r\nEighty years ago England possessed only one tattered copy of 'Child\r\nWaters' and 'Sir Cauline,' and Spain only one tattered copy of the noble\r\npoem of the 'Cid.'  The snuff of a candle, or a mischievous dog, might in\r\na moment have deprived the world forever of any of those fine\r\ncompositions.  Sir Walter Scott, who united to the fire of a great poet\r\nthe minute curiosity and patient diligence of a great antiquary, was but\r\njust in time to save the precious reliques of the Minstrelsy of the\r\nBorder.\"\r\n\r\nBut Percy not only rescued, himself, a number of ballads from\r\nforgetfulness; what was equally important, his book prompted others to\r\nhunt out and publish similar relics before it was too late.  It was the\r\noccasion of collections like Herd's (1769), Scott's (1802-03), and\r\nMotherwell's (1827), and many more, resting on purer texts and edited on\r\nmore scrupulous principles than his own.  Futhermore, his ballads helped\r\nto bring about a reform in literary taste and to inspire men of original\r\ngenius.  Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Scott, all acknowledged the\r\ngreatest obligations to them.  Wordsworth said that English poetry had\r\nbeen \"absolutely redeemed\" by them.  \"I do not think there is a writer in\r\nverse of the present day who would not be proud to acknowledge his\r\nobligations to the 'Reliques.'  I know that it is so with my friends;\r\nand, for myself, I am happy that it is so with my friends; and, for\r\nmyself, I am happy in this occasion to make a public avowal of my\r\nown.\"[48]  Without the \"Reliques,\" \"The Ancient Mariner,\" \"The Lady of\r\nthe Lake,\" \"La Belle Dame sans Merci,\" \"Stratton Water,\" and \"The\r\nHaystack in the Floods\" might never have been.  Perhaps even the \"Lyrical\r\nBallads\" might never have been, or might have been something quite unlike\r\nwhat they are.  Wordsworth, to be sure, scarcely ranks among romantics,\r\nand he expressly renounces the romantic machinery:\r\n\r\n    \"The dragon's wing,\r\n    The magic ring,\r\n    I shall not covet for my dower.\"[49]\r\n\r\nWhat he learned from the popular ballad was the power of sincerity and of\r\ndirect and homely speech.\r\n\r\nAs for Scott, he has recorded in an oft-quoted passage the impression\r\nthat Percy's volumes made upon him in his school-days: \"I remember well\r\nthe spot where I read these volumes for the first time.  It was beneath a\r\nhuge plantain tree in the ruins of what had been intended for an\r\nold-fashioned arbor in the garden I have mentioned.  The summer day sped\r\nonward so fast that, notwithstanding the sharp appetite of thirteen, I\r\nforgot the hour of dinner, was sought for with anxiety, and was still\r\nfound entranced in my intellectual banquet.  To read and to remember was,\r\nin this instance, the same thing; and henceforth I overwhelmed my\r\nschool-fellows, and all who would hearken to me, with tragical\r\nrecitations from the ballads of Bishop Percy.  The first time, too, I\r\ncould scrape a few shillings together, I bought unto myself a copy of\r\nthese beloved volumes; nor do I believe I ever read a book so frequently,\r\nor with half the enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Reliques\" worked powerfully in Germany, too.  It was received in\r\nLessing's circle with universal enthusiasm,[50] and fell in with that\r\nnewly aroused interest in \"Volkslieder\" which prompted Herder's \"Stimmen\r\nder Völker\" (1778-79).[51]  Gottfried August Bürger, in particular, was a\r\npoet who may be said to have been made by the English ballad literature,\r\nof which he was an ardent student.  His poems were published in 1778, and\r\nincluded five translations from Percy: \"The Child of Elle\" (\"Die\r\nEntführung\"), \"The Friar of Orders Grey\" (\"Graurock\"), \"The Wanton Wife\r\nof Bath\" (\"Frau Schnips\"), \"King John and the Abbot of Canterbury\" (\"Der\r\nKaiser und der Abt\"), and \"Child Waters\" (\"Graf Walter\").  A. W. Schlegel\r\nsays that Burger did not select the more ancient and genuine pieces in\r\nthe \"Reliques\"; and, moreover, that he spoiled the simplicity of the\r\noriginals in his translations.  It was doubtless in part the success of\r\nthe \"Reliques\" that is answerable for many collections of old English\r\npoetry put forth in the last years of the century.  Tyrwhitt's \"Chaucer\"\r\nand Ritson's publications have been already mentioned.  George Ellis, a\r\nfriend and correspondent of Walter Scott, and a fellow of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, who was sometimes called \"the Sainte Palaye of England,\"\r\nissued his \"Specimens of Early English Poets\" in 1790; edited in 1796 G.\r\nL. Way's translations from French _fabliaux_ of the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries; and printed in 1805 three volumes of \"Early English\r\nMetrical Romances.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to record that Percy's labors brought him public\r\nrecognition and the patronage of those whom Dr. Johnson used to call \"the\r\ngreat.\"  He had dedicated the \"Reliques\" to Elizabeth Percy, Countess of\r\nNorthumberland.  Himself the son of a grocer, he liked to think that he\r\nwas connected by blood with the great northern house whose exploits had\r\nbeen sung by the ancient minstrels that he loved.  He became chaplain to\r\nthe Duke of Northumberland, and to King George III.; and, in 1782, Bishop\r\nof Dromore in Ireland, in which see he died in 1811.\r\n\r\nThis may be as fit a place as any to introduce some mention of \"The\r\nMinstrel, or the Progress of Genius,\" by James Beattie; a poem once\r\nwidely popular, in which several strands of romantic influence are seen\r\ntwisted together.  The first book was published in 1771, the second in\r\n1774, and the work was never completed.  It was in the Spenserian stanza,\r\nwas tinged with the enthusiastic melancholy of the Wartons, followed the\r\nlandscape manner of Thomson, had elegiac echoes of Gray, and was perhaps\r\nnot unaffected, in its love of mountain scenery, by MacPherson's\r\n\"Ossian.\"  But it took its title and its theme from a hint in Percy's\r\n\"Essay on the Ancient Minstrels.\"[52]  Beattie was Professor of Moral\r\nPhilosophy in the University of Aberdeen.  He was an amiable, sensitive,\r\ndeeply religious man.  He was fond of music and of nature, and was easily\r\nmoved to rears; had \"a young girl's nerves,\" says Taine, \"and an old\r\nmaid's hobbies.\"  Gray, who met him in 1765, when on a visit to the Earl\r\nof Strathmore at Glammis Castle, esteemed him highly.  So did Dr.\r\nJohnson, partly because of his \"Essay on Truth\" (1770), a shallow\r\ninvective against Hume, which gained its author an interview with George\r\nIII. and a pension of two hundred pounds a year.  Beattie visited London\r\nin 1771, and figured there as a champion of orthodoxy and a\r\nheaven-inspired bard.  Mrs. Montagu patronized him extensively.  Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds painted his portrait, with his \"Essay on Truth\" under his\r\narm, and Truth itself in the background, an allegoric angel holding the\r\nbalances in one hand, and thrusting away with the other the figures of\r\nPrejudice, Skepticism, and Folly.  Old Lord Lyttelton had the poet out to\r\nHagley, and declared that he was Thomson come back to earth, to sing of\r\nvirtue and of the beauties of nature.  Oxford made him an LL.D.: he was\r\nurged to take orders in the Church of England; and Edinburgh offered him\r\nthe chair of Moral Philosophy.  Beattie's head was slightly turned by all\r\nthis success, and he became something of a tuft-hunter.  But he stuck\r\nfaithfully to Aberdeen, whose romantic neighborhood had first inspired\r\nhis muse.  The biographers tell a pretty story of his teaching his little\r\nboy to look for the hand of God in the universe, by sowing cress in a\r\ngarden plot in the shape of the child's initials and leading him by this\r\ngently persuasive analogy to read design in the works of nature.\r\n\r\nThe design of \"The Minstrel\" is to \"trace the progress of a Poetical\r\nGenius, born in a rude age,\" a youthful shepherd who \"lived in Gothic\r\ndays.\"  But nothing less truly Gothic or medieval could easily be\r\nimagined than the actual process of this young poet's education.  Instead\r\nof being taught to carve and ride and play the flute, like Chaucer's\r\nsquire who\r\n\r\n    \"Cowde songes make and wel endite,\r\n    Juste and eek daunce, and wel purtraye and write,\"\r\n\r\nEdwin wanders alone upon the mountains and in solitary places and is\r\ninstructed in history, philosophy, and science--and even in Vergil--by an\r\naged hermit, who sits on a mossy rock, with his harp beside him, and\r\ndelivers lectures.  The subject of the poem, indeed, is properly the\r\neducation of nature; and in a way it anticipates Wordsworth's \"Prelude,\"\r\nas this hoary sage does the \"Solitary\" of \"The Excursion.\"  Beattie\r\njustifies his use of Spenser's stanza on the ground that it \"seems, from\r\nits Gothic structure and original, to bear some relation to the subject\r\nand spirit of the poem.\"  He makes no attempt, however, to follow\r\nSpenser's \"antique expressions.\"  The following passage will illustrate\r\nas well as any the romantic character of the whole:\r\n\r\n    \"When the long-sounding curfew from afar\r\n    Loaded with loud lament the lonely gale,\r\n    Young Edwin, lighted by the evening star,\r\n    Lingering and listening, wandered down the vale.\r\n    There would he dream of graves and corses pale,\r\n    And ghosts that to the charnel-dungeon throng,\r\n    And drag a length of clanking chain, and wail,\r\n    Till silenced by the owl's terrific song,\r\n    Or blast that shrieks by fits the shuddering aisles along.\r\n\r\n    \"Or when the settling moon, in crimson dyed,\r\n    Hung o'er the dark and melancholy deep,\r\n    To haunted stream, remote from man, he hied,\r\n    Where fays of yore their revels wont to keep;\r\n    And there let Fancy rove at large, till sleep\r\n    A vision brought to his entrancëd sight.\r\n    And first a wildly murmuring wind gan creep\r\n    Shrill to his ringing ear; then tapers bright,\r\n    With instantaneous gleam, illumed the vault of night.\r\n\r\n    \"Anon in view a portal's blazing arch\r\n    Arose; the trumpet bids the valves unfold;\r\n    And forth a host of little warriors march,\r\n    Grasping the diamond lance and targe of gold.\r\n    Their look was gentle, their demeanor bold,\r\n    And green their helms, and green their silk attire;\r\n    And here and there, right venerably old,\r\n    The long-robed minstrels wake the warbling wire,\r\n    And some with mellow breath the martial pipe inspire.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThe influence of Thomson is clearly perceptible in these stanzas.  \"The\r\nMinstrel,\" like \"The Seasons,\" abounds in insipid morality, the\r\ncommonplaces of denunciation against luxury and ambition, and the praise\r\nof simplicity and innocence.  The titles alone of Beattie's minor poems\r\nare enough to show in what school he was a scholar: \"The Hermit,\" \"Ode to\r\nPeace,\" \"The Triumph of Melancholy,\" \"Retirement,\" etc., etc.  \"The\r\nMinstrel\" ran through four editions before the publication of its second\r\nbook in 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Svend Grundtvig's great collection, \"Danmarks Gamle Folkeviser,\" was\r\npublished in five volumes in 1853-90.\r\n\r\n[2] Francis James Child's \"English and Scottish Popular Ballads,\" issued\r\nin ten parts in 1882-98 is one of the glories of American scholarship.\r\n\r\n[3] _Cf._ The Tannhäuser legend and the Venusberg.\r\n\r\n[4] \"The Wife of Usher's Well.\"\r\n\r\n[5] It should never be forgotten that the ballad (derived from\r\n_ballare--to dance)_ was originally not a written poem, but a song and\r\ndance.  Many of the old tunes are preserved.  A number are given in\r\nChappell's \"Popular Music of the Olden Time,\" and in the appendix to\r\nMotherwell's \"Minstrelsy, Ancient and Modern\" (1827).\r\n\r\n[6] \"A Ballad.\"  One theory explains these meaningless refrains as\r\nremembered fragments of older ballads.\r\n\r\n[7] Reproduced by Rossetti and other moderns.  See them parodied in Robert\r\nBuchanan's \"Fleshly School of Poets\":\r\n\r\n    \"When seas do roar and skies do pour,\r\n    Hard is the lot of the sailór\r\n    Who scarcely, as he reels, can tell\r\n    The sidelights from the binnacle.\"\r\n\r\n[8] \"I never heard the old song of Percie and Douglas that I found not my\r\nheart moved more than with a trumpet; and yet it is sung but by some\r\nblind crouder, with no rougher voice than rude style; which being so evil\r\napparelled in the dust and cobwebs of that uncivil age, what would it\r\nwork, trimmed in the gorgeous eloquence of Pindar!\"\r\n\r\n[9] Empty: \"Bonnie George Campbell.\"\r\n\r\n[10] \"Lord Randall.\"\r\n\r\n[11] Turf: \"The Twa Corbies.\"\r\n\r\n[12] I use this phrase without any polemic purpose.  The question of\r\norigins is not here under discussion.  Of course at some stage in the\r\nhistory of any ballad the poet, the individual artist, is present, though\r\nthe precise ration of his agency to the communal element in the work is\r\nobscure.  For an acute and learned view of this topic, see the\r\nIntroduction to \"Old English Ballads,\" by Professor Francis B.

From a letter to Walpole (June 1760) it\r\nwould seem that the latter had sent Gray two manuscript bits of the as\r\nyet unprinted \"Fragments,\" communicated to Walpole by Sir David\r\nDalrymple, who furnished Scotch ballads to Percy.  \"I am so charmed,\"\r\nwrote Gray, \"with the two specimens of Erse poetry, that I cannot help\r\ngiving you the trouble to inquire a little farther about them; and should\r\nwish to see a few lines of the original, that I may form some slight idea\r\nof the language, the measures and the rhythm.  Is there anything known of\r\nthe author or authors; and of what antiquity are they supposed to be?  Is\r\nthere any more to be had of equal beauty, or at all approaching it?\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Shonehewer (June 29,) he writes: \"I have received another\r\nScotch packet with a third specimen . . . full of nature and noble wild\r\nimagination.\"[2]  And in the month following he writes to Wharton: \"If\r\nyou have seen Stonehewer, he has probably told you of my old Scotch\r\n(rather Irish) poetry.  I am gone mad about them.  They are said to be\r\ntranslations (literal and in prose) from the _Erse_ tongue, done by one\r\nMacPherson, a young clergyman in the Highlands.  He means to publish a\r\ncollection he has of these specimens of antiquity, if it be antiquity;\r\nbut what plagues me, is, I cannot come at any certainty on that head.  I\r\nwas so struck, so _extasié_ with their infinite beauty, that I writ into\r\nScotland to make a thousand enquiries.\"  This is strong language for a\r\nman of Gray's coolly critical temper; but all his correspondence of about\r\nthis date is filled with references to Ossian which enable the modern\r\nreader to understand in part the excitement that the book created among\r\nGray's contemporaries.  The letters that he got from MacPherson were\r\nunconvincing, \"ill-wrote, ill-reasoned, calculated to deceive, and yet\r\nnot cunning enough to do it cleverly.\"  The external evidence disposed\r\nhim to believe the poems counterfeit; but the impression which they made\r\nwas such that he was \"resolved to believe them genuine, spite of the\r\nDevil and the Kirk.  It is impossible to convince me that they were\r\ninvented by the same man that writes me these letters.  On the other\r\nhand, it is almost as hard to suppose, if they are original, that he\r\nshould be able to translate them so admirably.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 7 he writes to Mason that the Erse fragments have been\r\npublished five weeks ago in Scotland, though he had not received his copy\r\ntill the last week.  \"I continue to think them genuine, though my reasons\r\nfor believing the contrary are rather stronger than ever.\"  David Hume,\r\nwho afterward became skeptical as to their authenticity, wrote to Gray,\r\nassuring him that these poems were in everybody's mouth in the Highlands,\r\nand had been handed down from father to son, from an age beyond all\r\nmemory and tradition.  Gray's final conclusion is very much the same with\r\nthat of the general public, to which the Ossianic question is even yet a\r\npuzzle.  \"I remain still in doubt about the authenticity of these poems,\r\ntho' inclining rather to believe them genuine in spite of the world.\r\nWhether they are the inventions of antiquity, or of a modern Scotchman,\r\neither case is to me alike unaccountable.  _Je m'y perds._\"\r\n\r\nWe are more concerned here with the impression which MacPherson's books,\r\ntaking them just as they stand, made upon their contemporary Europe, than\r\nwith the history of the controversy to which they gave rise, and which is\r\nstill unsettled after more than a century and a quarter of discussion.\r\nNevertheless, as this controversy began immediately upon their\r\npublication, and had reference not only to the authenticity of the\r\nOssianic poems, but also to their literary value; it cannot be altogether\r\nignored in this account.  The principal facts upon which it turned may be\r\ngiven in a nut-shell.  In 1759 Mr. John Home, author of the tragedy of\r\n\"Douglas,\" who had become interested in the subject of Gaelic poetry, met\r\nin Dumfriesshire a young Scotchman, named James MacPherson, who was\r\ntraveling as private tutor to Mr. Graham of Balgowan.  MacPherson had in\r\nhis possession a number of manuscripts which, he said, were transcripts\r\nof Gaelic poems taken down from the recital of old people in the\r\nHighlands.  He translated two of these for Home, who was so much struck\r\nwith them that he sent or showed copies to Dr. Hugh Blair, Professor of\r\nRhetoric in the University of Edinburgh.  At the solicitation of Dr.\r\nBlair and Mr. Home, MacPherson was prevailed upon to make further\r\ntranslations from the materials in his hands; and these, to the number of\r\nsixteen, were published in the \"Fragments\" already mentioned, with a\r\npreface of eight pages by Blair.  They attracted so much attention in\r\nEdinburgh that a subscription was started, to send the compiler through\r\nthe Highlands in search of more Gaelic poetry.\r\n\r\nThe result of the researches was \"Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem in Six\r\nBooks: Together with several other poems, composed by Ossian the son of\r\nFingal.  Translated from the Gaelic language by James MacPherson,\"\r\nLondon, 1762; together with \"Temora, an Ancient Epic Poem in Eight\r\nBooks,\" etc., etc., London, 1763.  MacPherson asserted that he had made\r\nhis versions from Gaelic poems ascribed to Ossian or Oisin, the son of\r\nFingal or Finn MacCumhail, a chief renowned in Irish and Scottish song\r\nand popular legend.  Fingal was the king of Morven, a district of the\r\nwestern Highlands, and head of the ancient warlike clan or race of the\r\nFeinne or Fenians.  Tradition placed him in the third century and\r\nconnected  him with the battle of Gabhra, fought in 281.  His son,\r\nOssian, the warrior-bard, survived all his kindred.  Blind and old,\r\nseated in his empty hall, or the cave of the rock; alone save for the\r\nwhite-armed Malvina, bride of his dead son, Oscar, he struck the harp and\r\nsang the memories of his  youth: \"a tale of the times of old.\"\r\n\r\nMacPherson translated--or composed--his \"Ossian\" in an exclamatory,\r\nabrupt, rhapsodical prose, resembling somewhat the English of Isaiah and\r\nothers of the books of the prophets.  The manners described were heroic,\r\nthe state of society primitive.  The properties were few and simple; the\r\ncars of the heroes, their spears, helmets, and blue shields; the harp,\r\nthe shells from which they drank in the hall, etc.  Conventional compound\r\nepithets abound, as in Homer: the \"dark-bosomed\" ships, the \"car-borne\"\r\nheroes, the \"white-armed\" maids, the \"long-bounding\" dogs of the chase.\r\nThe scenery is that of the western Highlands; and the solemn monotonous\r\nrhythm of MacPherson's style accorded well with the tone of his\r\ndescriptions, filling the mind with images of vague sublimity and\r\ndesolation: the mountain torrent, the dark rock in the ocean, the mist on\r\nthe hills, the ghosts of heroes half seen by the setting moon, the\r\nthistle in the ruined courts of chieftains, the grass whistling on the\r\nwindy heath, the blue stream of Lutha, and the cliffs of sea-surrounded\r\nGormal.  It was noticed that there was no mention of the wolf, common in\r\nancient Caledonia; nor of the thrush or lark or any singing bird; nor of\r\nthe salmon of the sealochs, so often referred to in modern Gaelic poetry.\r\nBut the deer, the swan, the boar, eagle, and raven occur repeatedly.\r\n\r\nBut a passage or two will exhibit the language and imagery of the whole\r\nbetter than pages of description.  \"I have seen the walls of Balclutha,\r\nbut they were desolate.  The fire had resounded in the halls, and the\r\nvoice of the people is heard no more.  The stream of Clutha was removed\r\nfrom its place by the fall of the walls.  The thistle shook there its\r\nlonely head; the moss whistled to the wind.  The fox looked out from the\r\nwindows, the rank grass of the wall waved round its head.  Desolate is\r\nthe dwelling of Moina, silence is in the house of her fathers.  Raise the\r\nsong of mourning, O bards, over the land of strangers.  They have but\r\nfallen before us; for, one day, we must fall.  Why dost thou build the\r\nhall, son of the winged days?  Thou lookest from thy towers to-day; yet a\r\nfew years, and the blast of the desert comes; it howls in thy empty\r\ncourt, and whistles round thy half-worn shield.\"[3]  \"They rose rustling\r\nlike a flock of sea-fowl when the waves expel them from the shore.  Their\r\nsound was like a thousand streams that meet in Cona's vale, when, after a\r\nstormy night, they turn their dark eddies beneath the pale light of the\r\nmorn.  As the dark shades of autumn fly over hills of grass; so, gloomy,\r\ndark, successive came the chiefs of Lochlin's[4] echoing woods.  Tall as\r\nthe stag of Morven, moved stately before them the King.[5]  His shining\r\nshield is on his side, like a flame on the heath at night; when the world\r\nis silent and dark, and the traveler sees some ghost sporting in the\r\nbeam.  Dimly gleam the hills around, and show indistinctly their oaks.  A\r\nblast from the troubled ocean removed the settled mist.  The sons of Erin\r\nappear, like a ridge of rocks on the coast; when mariners, on shores\r\nunknown are trembling at veering winds.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe authenticity of the \"Fragments\" of 1760 had not passed without\r\nquestion; but MacPherson brought forward entire epics which, he asserted,\r\nwere composed by a Highland bard of the third century, handed down\r\nthrough ages by oral tradition, and finally committed--at least in\r\npart--to writing and now extant in manuscripts in his possession, there\r\nensued at once a very emphatic expression of incredulity.  Among the most\r\ntruculent of the disbelievers was Dr. Johnson.  He had little liking for\r\nScotland, still less for the poetry of barbarism.  In his tour of the\r\nWestern Islands with Boswell in 1773, he showed an insensibility, and\r\neven a kind of hostility, to the wild beauties of Highland scenery, which\r\ngradually affects the reader with a sense of the ludicrous as he watches\r\nhis sturdy figure rolling along on a small Highland pony by sequestered\r\nLoch Ness, with its fringe of birch trees, or between the prodigious\r\nmountains that frown above Glensheal; or seated in a boat off the Mull of\r\nCantyre, listening to the Erse songs of the rowers:\r\n\r\n    \"Breaking the silence of the seas\r\n    Among the farthest Hebrides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Johnson,\" says Boswell, \"owned he was now in a scene of as wild\r\nnature as he could see; but he corrected me sometimes in my inaccurate\r\nobservations.  'There,' said I, 'is a mountain like a cone.'  Johnson:\r\n'No, sir.  It would be called so in a book, but when a man comes to look\r\nat it, he sees it is not so.  It is indeed pointed at the top, but one\r\nside of it is larger than the other.'  Another mountain I called immense.\r\nJohnson: 'No; it is no more than a considerable protuberance.'\"\r\n\r\nJohnson not only disputed the antiquity of MacPherson's \"Ossian,\" but he\r\ndenied it any poetic merit.  Dr. Blair having asked him whether he\r\nthought any man of a modern age could have written such poems, he\r\nanswered: \"Yes, sir: many men, many women and many children.\"  \"Sir,\" he\r\nexclaimed to Reynolds, \"a man might write such stuff forever, if he would\r\n_abandon_ his mind to it.\"  To Mr. MacQueen, one of his Highland hosts,\r\nhe said: \"I look upon MacPherson's 'Fingal' to be as gross an imposition\r\nas ever the world was troubled with.\"  Johnson's arguments were mostly _a\r\npriori_.  He asserted that the ancient Gael were a barbarous people,\r\nincapable of producing poetry of the kind.  Long epics, such as \"Fingal\"\r\nand \"Temora,\" could not be preserved in memory and handed down by word of\r\nmouth.  As to ancient manuscripts which MacPherson pretended to have,\r\nthere was not a Gaelic manuscript in existence a hundred years old.\r\n\r\nIt is now quite well established that Dr. Johnson was wrong on all these\r\npoints.  To say nothing of the Homeric poems, the ancient Finns,\r\nScandinavians, and Germans were as barbarous as the Gael; yet they\r\nproduced the Kalewala, the Edda, and the Nibelungen Lied.  The Kalewala,\r\na poem of 22, 793 lines--as long as the Iliad--was transmitted orally\r\nfrom a remote antiquity and first printed in 1849.  As to Gaelic\r\nmanuscripts, there are over sixty in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh,\r\nvarying in age from three hundred to five hundred years.[7]  There is,\r\n_e.g._, the \"Glenmasan Manuscript\" of the year 1238, containing the story\r\nof \"Darthula,\"[8] which is the groundwork of the same story in\r\nMacPherson's \"Ossian.\"  There is the important \"Dean of Lismore's Book,\"\r\na manuscript collection made by Dean MacGregory of Lismore, Argyleshire,\r\nbetween 1512 and 1529, containing 11,000 lines of Gaelic poetry, some of\r\nwhich is attributed to Ossian or Oisin.  One of the poems is identical in\r\nsubstance with the first book of MacPherson's \"Temora;\" although Mr.\r\nCampbell says, \"There is not one line in the Dean's book that I can\r\nidentify with any line in MacPherson's Gaelic.\"[9]\r\n\r\nOther objections to the authenticity of MacPherson's translations rested\r\nupon internal evidence, upon their characteristics of thought and style.\r\nIt was alleged that the \"peculiar tone of sentimental grandeur and\r\nmelancholy\" which distinguishes them, is false to the spirit of all known\r\nearly poetry, and is a modern note.  In particular, it was argued,\r\nMacPherson's heroes are too sensitive to the wild and sublime in nature.\r\nProfessor William R. Sullivan, a high authority on Celtic literature,\r\nsays that in the genuine and undoubted remains of old Irish poetry\r\nbelonging to the Leinster or Finnian Cycle and ascribed to Oisin, there\r\nis much detail in descriptions of arms, accouterments, and articles of\r\nindoor use and ornament, but very little in descriptions of outward\r\nnature.[10]  On the other hand, the late Principal Shairp regards this\r\n\"sadness of tone in describing nature\" as a strong proof of authenticity.\r\n\"Two facts,\" he says, \"are enough to convince me of the genuineness of\r\nthe ancient Gaelic poetry.  The truthfulness with which it reflects the\r\nmelancholy aspects of Highland scenery, the equal truthfulness with which\r\nit expresses the prevailing sentiment of the Gael, and his sad sense of\r\nhis people's destiny.  I need no other proofs that the Ossianic poetry is\r\na native formation, and comes from the primeval heart of the Gaelic\r\nrace.\"[11]  And he quotes, in support of his view, a well-known passage\r\nfrom Matthew Arnold's \"Study of Celtic Literature\": \"The Celts are the\r\nprime authors of this vein of piercing regret and passion, of this\r\nTitanism in poetry.  A famous book, MacPherson's 'Ossian,' carried, in\r\nthe last century, this vein like a flood of lava through Europe.  I am\r\nnot going to criticise MacPherson's 'Ossian' here.  Make the part of what\r\nis forged, modern, tawdry, spurious in the book as large as you please;\r\nstrip Scotland, if you like, of every feather of borrowed plumes which,\r\non the strength of MacPherson's 'Ossian,' she may have stolen from that\r\n_vetus et major Scotia_--Ireland; I make no objection.  But there will\r\nstill be left in the book a residue with the very soul of the Celtic\r\ngenius in it; and which has the proud distinction of having brought this\r\nsoul of the Celtic genius into contact with the nations of modern Europe,\r\nand enriched all our poetry by it.  Woody Morven, and echoing Lora, and\r\nSelma with its silent halls!  We all owe them a debt of gratitude, and\r\nwhen we are unjust enough to forget it, may the Muse forget us!  Choose\r\nany one of the better passages in MacPherson's 'Ossian,' and you can see,\r\neven at this time of day, what an apparition of newness and of power such\r\na strain must have been in the eighteenth century.\"\r\n\r\nBut from this same kind of internal evidence, Wordsworth draws just the\r\nopposite conclusion.  \"The phantom was begotten by the snug embrace of an\r\nimpudent Highlander upon a cloud of tradition.  It traveled southward,\r\nwhere it was greeted with acclamation, and the thin consistence took its\r\ncourse through Europe upon the breath of popular applause.[12]. . .  Open\r\nthis far-famed book!  I have done so at random, and the beginning of the\r\nepic poem 'Temora,' in eight books, presents itself.  'The blue waves of\r\nUllin roll in light.  The green hills are covered with day.  Trees shake\r\ntheir dusky heads in the breeze.  Gray torrents pour their noisy streams.\r\nTwo green hills with aged oaks surround a narrow plain.  The blue course\r\nof a stream is there.  On its banks stood Cairbar of Atha.  His spear\r\nsupports the king: the red eyes of his fear are sad.  Cormac rises on his\r\nsoul with all his ghastly wounds. . .'  Having had the good fortune to be\r\nborn and reared in a mountainous country, from my very childhood I have\r\nfelt the falsehood that pervades the volumes imposed upon the world under\r\nthe name of Ossian.  From what I saw with my own eyes, I knew that the\r\nimagery was spurious.  In nature everything is distinct, yet nothing\r\ndefined into absolute, independent singleness.  In MacPherson's work it\r\nis exactly the reverse: everything (that is not stolen) is in this manner\r\ndefined, insulated, dislocated, deadened, yet nothing distinct.  It will\r\nalways be so when words are substituted for things.  To say that the\r\ncharacters never could exist; that the manners are impossible; and that a\r\ndream has more substance than the whole state of society, as there\r\ndepicted, is doing nothing more than pronouncing a censure which\r\nMacPherson defied. . .  Yet, much as these pretended treasures of\r\nantiquity have been admired, they have been wholly uninfluential upon the\r\nliterature of the country.  No succeeding writer appears to have caught\r\nfrom them a ray of inspiration; no author in the least distinguished has\r\nventured formally to imitate them, except the boy Chatterton, on their\r\nfirst appearance. . .  This incapability to amalgamate with the\r\nliterature of the Island is, in my estimation, a decisive proof that the\r\nbook is essentially unnatural; nor should I require any other to\r\ndemonstrate it to be a forgery, audacious as worthless.  Contrast, in\r\nthis respect, the effect of MacPherson's publication with the 'Reliques'\r\nof Percy, so unassuming, so modest in their pretensions.\"\r\n\r\nOther critics have pointed out a similar indistinctness in the human\r\nactors, no less than in the landscape features of \"Fingal\" and \"Temora.\"\r\nThey have no dramatic individuality, but are all alike, and all extremely\r\nshadowy.  \"Poor, moaning, monotonous MacPherson\" is Carlyle's\r\nalliterative description of the translator of \"Ossian\"; and it must be\r\nconfessed that, in spite of the deep poetic feeling which pervades these\r\nwritings, and the undeniable beauty of single passages, they have\r\ndamnable iteration.  The burden of their song is a burden in every sense.\r\nMr. Malcolm Laing, one of MacPherson's most persistent adversaries, who\r\npublished \"Notes and Illustrations to Ossian\" in 1805, essayed to show,\r\nby a minute analysis of the language, that the whole thing was a\r\nfabrication, made up from Homer, Milton, the English Bible, and other\r\nsources.  Thus he compared MacPherson's \"Like the darkened moon when she\r\nmoves, a dim circle, through heaven, and dreadful change is expected by\r\nmen,\" with Milton's\r\n\r\n                \"Or from behind the moon,\r\n    In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds\r\n    On half the nations, and with fear of change\r\n    Perplexes monarchs.\"\r\n\r\nLaing's method proves too much and might be applied with like results to\r\nalmost any literary work.  And, in general, it is hazardous to draw hard\r\nand fast conclusions from internal evidence of the sort just reviewed.\r\nTaken altogether, these objections do leave a strong bias upon the mind,\r\nand were one to pronounce upon the genuineness of MacPherson's \"Ossian,\"\r\nas a whole, from impressions of tone and style, it might be guessed that\r\nwhatever element of true ancient poetry it contains, it had been\r\nthoroughly steeped in modern sentiment before it was put before the\r\npublic.  But remembering Beowulf and the Norse mythology, one might\r\nhesitate to say that the songs of primitive, heroic ages are always\r\ninsensible to the sublime in nature; or to admit that melancholy is a\r\nCeltic monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe most damaging feature of MacPherson's case was his refusal or neglect\r\nto produce his originals.  The testimony of those who helped him in\r\ncollecting and translating leaves little doubt that he had materials of\r\nsome kind; and that these consisted partly of old Gaelic manuscripts, and\r\npartly of transcriptions taken down in Gaelic from the recitation of aged\r\npersons in the Highlands.  These testimonies may be read in the \"Report\r\nof the Committee of the Highland Society,\" Edinburgh, 1805.[13]  It is\r\ntoo voluminous to examine here, and it leaves unsettled the point as to\r\nthe precise use which MacPherson made of his materials, whether, _i.e._,\r\nhe gave literal renderings of them, as he professed to do; or whether he\r\nmanipulated them--and to what extent--by piecing fragments together,\r\nlopping, dove-tailing, smoothing, interpolating, modernizing, as Percy\r\ndid with his ballads.  He was challenged to show his Gaelic manuscripts,\r\nand Mr. Clerk says that he accepted the challenge.  \"He deposited the\r\nmanuscripts at his publishers', Beckett and De Hondt, Strand, London.  He\r\nadvertised in the newspapers that he had done so; offered to publish them\r\nif a sufficient number of subscribers came forward; and in the _Literary\r\nJournal_ of the year 1784, Beckett certifies that the manuscripts had\r\nlain in his shop for the space of a whole year.\"[14]\r\n\r\nBut this was more than twenty years after.  Mr. Clerk does not show that\r\nJohnson or Laing or Shaw or Pinkerton, or any of MacPherson's numerous\r\ncritics, ever saw any such advertisement, or knew where the manuscripts\r\nwere to be seen; or that--being ignorant of Gaelic--it would have helped\r\nthem if they had known; and he admits that \"MacPherson's subsequent\r\nconduct, in postponing from time to time the publication, when urged to\r\nit by friends who had liberally furnished him with means for the\r\npurpose . . . is indefensible.\"  In 1773 and 1775, _e.g._, Dr. Johnson\r\nwas calling loudly for the production of the manuscripts.  \"The state of\r\nthe question,\" he wrote to Boswell, February 7, 1775, \"is this.  He and\r\nDr. Blair, whom I consider as deceived, say that he copied the poem from\r\nold manuscripts.  His copies, if he had them--and I believe him to have\r\nnone--are nothing.  Where are thee manuscripts?  They can be shown if\r\nthey exist, but they were never shown.  _De non existentibus et non\r\napparentibus eadem est ratio._\"  And during his Scotch trip in 1773, at a\r\ndinner at Sir Alexander Gordon's, Johnson said: \"If the poems were really\r\ntranslated, they were certainly first written down.  Let Mr. MacPherson\r\ndeposit the manuscripts in one of the colleges at Aberdeen, where there\r\nare people who can judge; and if the professors certify their\r\nauthenticity, then there will be an end of the controversy.  If he\r\ndoes not take this obvious and easy method, he gives the best reason to\r\ndoubt.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed the subsequent history of these alleged manuscripts casts the\r\ngravest suspicion on MacPherson's good faith.  A thousand pounds were\r\nfinally subscribed to pay for the publication of the Gaelic texts.  But\r\nthese MacPherson never published.  He sent the manuscripts which were\r\nultimately published in 1807 to his executor, Mr. John Mackenzie; and he\r\nleft one thousand pounds by his will to defray the expense of printing\r\nthem.  After MacPherson's death in 1796, Mr. Mackenzie \"delayed the\r\npublication from day to day, and at last handed over the manuscripts to\r\nthe Highland Society,\"[15] which had them printed in 1807, nearly a half\r\ncentury after the first appearance of the English Ossian.[16]  These,\r\nhowever, were not the identical manuscripts which MacPherson had found,\r\nor said that he had found, in his tour of exploration through the\r\nHighlands.  They were all in his own handwriting or in that of his\r\namanuenses.  Moreover the Rev. Thomas Ross was employed by the society to\r\ntranscribe them and conform the spelling to that of the Gaelic Bible,\r\nwhich is modern.  The printed text of 1807, therefore, does not represent\r\naccurately even MacPherson's Gaelic.  Whether the transcriber took any\r\nfurther liberties than simply modernizing the spelling cannot be known,\r\nfor the same mysterious fate that overtook MacPherson's original\r\ncollections followed his own manuscript.  This, after being at one time\r\nin the Advocates' Library, has now utterly disappeared.  Mr. Campbell\r\nthinks that under this double process of distillation--a copy by\r\nMacPherson and then a copy by Ross--\"the ancient form of the language, if\r\nit was ancient, could hardly survive.\"[17]  \"What would become of\r\nChaucer,\" he asks, \"so maltreated and finally spelt according to modern\r\nrules of grammar and orthography?  I have found by experience that an\r\nalteration in 'spelling' may mean an entire change of construction and\r\nmeaning, and a substitution of whole words.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Gaelic text of 1807 was attacked in more vital points than its\r\nspelling.  It was freely charged with being an out-and-out fabrication, a\r\ntranslation of MacPherson's English prose into modern Gaelic.  This\r\nquestion is one which must be settled by Gaelic scholars, and these still\r\ndisagree.  In 1862 Mr. Campbell wrote: \"When the Gaelic 'Fingal,'\r\npublished in 1807, is compared with any one of the translations which\r\npurport to have been made from it, it seems to me incomparably superior.\r\nIt is far simpler in diction.  It has a peculiar rhythm and assonance\r\nwhich seem to repel the notion of a mere translation from English, as\r\nsomething almost absurd.  It is impossible that it can be a translation\r\nfrom MacPherson's English, unless there was some clever Gaelic poet[18]\r\nthen alive, able and willing to write what Eton schoolboys call\r\n'full-sense verses.'\"  The general testimony is that MacPherson's own\r\nknowledge of Gaelic was imperfect.  Mr. Campbell's summary of the whole\r\nmatter--in 1862--is as follows: \"My theory then is, that about the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century, or the end of the seventeenth, or\r\nearlier, Highland bards may have fused floating popular traditions into\r\nmore complete forms, engrafting their own ideas on what they found; and\r\nthat MacPherson found their works, translated and altered them; published\r\nthe translation in 1760;[19] made the Gaelic ready for the press;\r\npublished some of it in 1763,[20] and made away with the evidence of what\r\nhe had done, when he found that his conduct was blamed.  I can see no\r\nother way out of the maze of testimony.\"  But by 1872 Mr. Campbell had\r\ncome to a conclusion much less favorable to the claims of the Gaelic\r\ntext.  He now considers that the English was first composed by MacPherson\r\nand that \"he and other translators afterward worked at it and made a\r\nGaelic equivalent whose merit varies according to the translator's skill\r\nand knowledge of Gaelic.\"[21]  On the other hand, Mr. W. F. Skene and Mr.\r\nArchibald Clerk, are confident that the Gaelic is the original and the\r\nEnglish the translation.  Mr. Clerk, who reprinted the Highland Society's\r\ntext in 1870,[22] with a literal translation of his own on alternate\r\npages and MacPherson's English at the foot of the page, believes\r\nimplicitly in the antiquity and genuineness of the Gaelic originals.\r\n\"MacPherson,\" he writes, \"got much from manuscripts and much from oral\r\nrecitation.  It is most probable that he has given the minor poems\r\nexactly as he found them.  He may have made considerable changes in the\r\nlarger ones in giving them their present form; although I do not believe\r\nthat he, or any of his assistants, added much even in the way of\r\nconnecting links between the various episodes.\"\r\n\r\nTo a reader unacquainted with Gaelic, comparing MacPherson's English with\r\nMr. Clerk's, it certainly looks unlikely that the Gaelic can be merely a\r\ntranslation from the former.  The reflection in a mirror cannot be more\r\ndistinct than the object it reflects; and if Mr. Clerk's version can be\r\ntrusted (it appears to be more literal though less rhetorical than\r\nMacPherson's) the Gaelic is often concrete and sharp where MacPherson is\r\ngeneral; often plain where he is figurative or ornate; and sometimes of a\r\nmeaning quite different from his rendering.  Take, _e.g._, the closing\r\npassage of the second \"Duan,\" or book, of \"Fingal.\"\r\n\r\n\"An arrow found his manly breast.  He sleeps with his loved Galbina at\r\nthe noise of the sounding surge.  Their green tombs are seen by the\r\nmariner, when he bounds on the waves of the north.\"--_MacPherson_.\r\n\r\n    \"A ruthless arrow found his breast.\r\n    His sleep is by thy side, Galbina,\r\n    Where wrestles the wind with ocean.\r\n    The sailor sees their graves as one,\r\n    When rising on the ridge of the waves.\"\r\n                   --_Clerk_\r\n\r\nBut again Mr. Archibald Sinclair, a Glasgow publisher, a letter from whom\r\nis given by Mr. Campbell in his \"Tales of the West Highlands,\" has \"no\r\nhesitation in affirming that a considerable portion of the Gaelic which\r\nis published as the original of his [MacPherson's] translation, is\r\nactually translated back from the English.\"  And Professor Sullivan says:\r\n\"The so-called originals are a very curious kind of mosaic, constructed\r\nevidently with great labor afterward, in which sentences or parts of\r\nsentences of genuine poems are cemented together in a very inferior\r\nword-paste of MacPherson's own.\"[23]\r\n\r\nIt is of course no longer possible to maintain what Mr. Campbell says is\r\nthe commonest English opinion, viz., that MacPherson invented the\r\ncharacters and incidents of his \"Ossian,\" and that the poems had no\r\nprevious existence in any shape.  The evidence is overwhelming that there\r\nexisted, both in Ireland and the Scottish Highlands traditions, tales,\r\nand poems popularly attributed to Oisin, the son of Finn MacCumhail.  But\r\nno poem has been found which corresponds exactly to any single piece in\r\nMacPherson; and Sullivan cites, as one proof of the modern and spurious\r\ncharacter of these versions, the fact that they mingle names from the\r\nancient hero-cycle, like Darthula, Cuthullin, and Conlach, with names\r\nbelonging to the Finnian cycle, as is never the case in the authentic and\r\nundoubted remains of Celtic poetry.  Between 1760, the date of\r\nMacPherson's \"Fragments,\" and 1807, the date of the Highland Society's\r\ntext, there had been published independently nine hundred lines of\r\nOssianic verse in Gaelic in Gillie's collection, 1786, and Stewart's,\r\n1804.  In 1780 Dr. Smith had published his \"Ancient Lays,\" a free\r\ntranslation from Gaelic fragments, which he subsequently printed (1787)\r\nunder the title \"Sean Dàna,\" Smith frankly took liberties with his\r\noriginals, such as we may suppose that MacPherson took with his; but he\r\nmade no secret of this and, by giving the Gaelic on which his paraphrase\r\nrested, he enabled the public to see how far his \"Ancient Lays,\" were\r\nreally ancient, and how far they were built up into poetic wholes by his\r\nown editorial labors.[24]\r\n\r\nWordsworth's assertion of the failure of MacPherson's \"Ossian\" to\r\n\"amalgamate with the literature of this island\" needs some\r\nqualifications.  That it did not enter into English literature in a\r\nformative way, as Percy's ballads did, is true enough, and is easy of\r\nexplanation.  In the first place, it was professedly a prose translation\r\nfrom poetry in another tongue, and could hardly, therefore, influence the\r\nverse and diction of English poetry directly.  It could not even work\r\nupon them as directly as many foreign literatures have worked; as the\r\nancient classical literatures, _e.g._, have always worked; or as Italian\r\nand French and German have at various times worked; for the Gaelic was\r\npractically inaccessible to all but a few special scholars.  Whatever its\r\nbeauty or expressiveness, it was in worse case than a dead language, for\r\nit was marked with the stigma of barbarism.  In its palmiest days it had\r\nnever been what the Germans called a _Kultursprache_; and now it was the\r\nidiom of a few thousand peasants and mountaineers, and was rapidly\r\nbecoming extinct even in its native fastnesses.\r\n\r\nWhatever effect was to be wrought by the Ossianic poems upon the English\r\nmind, was to be wrought in the dress which MacPherson had given them.\r\nAnd perhaps, after all, the tumid and rhetorical cast of MacPherson's\r\nprose had a great deal to do with producing the extraordinary enthusiasm\r\nwith which his \"wild paraphrases,\" as Mr. Campbell calls them, were\r\nreceived by the public.  The age was tired of polish, of wit, of\r\nover-civilization; it was groping toward the rude, the primitive, the\r\nheroic; had begun to steep itself in melancholy sentiment and to feel a\r\ndawning admiration of mountain solitudes and the hoary past.  Suddenly\r\nhere was what it had been waiting for--\"a tale of the times of old\"; and\r\nthe solemn, dirge-like chant of MacPherson's sentences, with the peculiar\r\nmanner of his narrative, its repetitions, its want of transitions, suited\r\nwell with his matter.  \"Men had been talking under their breath, and in a\r\nmincing dialect so long,\" says Leslie Stephen, \"that they were easily\r\ngratified and easily imposed upon by an affectation of vigorous and\r\nnatural sentiment.\"\r\n\r\nThe impression was temporary, but it was immediate and powerful.\r\nWordsworth was wrong when he said that no author of distinction except\r\nChatterton had ventured formally to imitate Ossian.  A generation after\r\nthe appearance of the \"Fragments\" we find the youthful Coleridge alluding\r\nto \"Ossian\" in the preface[25] to his first collection of poems (1793),\r\nwhich contains two verse imitations of the same, as _ecce signum_:\r\n\r\n    \"How long will ye round me be swelling,\r\n      O ye blue-tumbling waves of the sea?\r\n    Not always in caves was my dwelling,\r\n      Nor beneath the cold blast of the tree,\" etc., etc.[26]\r\n\r\nIn Byron's \"House of Idleness\" (1807), published when he was a Cambridge\r\nundergraduate, is a piece of prose founded on the episode of Nisus and\r\nEuryalus in the \"Aeneid\" and entitled \"The Death of Calmar and Orla--An\r\nImitation of MacPherson's Ossian.\"  \"What form rises on the roar of\r\nclouds?  Whose dark ghost gleams in the red stream of tempests?  His\r\nvoice rolls on the thunder.  'Tis Orla, the brown chief of Orthona. . .\r\nLovely wast thou, son of blue-eyed Morla,\" etc.  After reading several\r\npages of such stuff, one comes to feel that Byron could do this sort of\r\nthing about as well as MacPherson himself; and indeed, that Johnson was\r\nnot so very far wrong when he said that anyone could do it if he would\r\nabandon his mind to it.  Chatterton applied the Ossianic verbiage in a\r\nnumber of pieces which he pretended to have translated from the Saxon:\r\n\"Ethelgar,\" \"Kenrick,\" \"Cerdick,\" and \"Gorthmund\"; as well as in a\r\ncomposition which he called \"Godred Crovan,\" from the Manx dialect, and\r\none from the ancient British, which he entitled \"The Heilas.\"  He did not\r\ncatch the trick quite so successfully as Byron, as a passage or two from\r\n\"Kenrick\" will show: \"Awake, son of Eldulph!  Thou that sleepest on the\r\nwhite mountain, with the fairest of women; no more pursue the dark brown\r\nwolf: arise from the mossy bank of the falling waters: let thy garments\r\nbe stained in blood, and the streams of life discolor thy girdle. . .\r\nCealwulf of the high mountain, who viewed the first rays of the morning\r\nstar, swift as the flying deer, strong as a young oak, fiery as an\r\nevening wolf, drew his sword; glittering like the blue vapors in the\r\nvalley of Horso; terrible as the red lightning bursting from the\r\ndark-brown clouds, his swift bark rode over the foaming waves like the\r\nwind in the tempest.\"\r\n\r\nIn a note on his Ossianic imitation, Byron said that Mr. Laing had proved\r\nOssian an impostor, but that the merit of MacPherson's work remained,\r\nalthough in parts his diction was turgid and bombastic.[27]  A poem in\r\nthe \"Hours of Idleness,\" upon the Scotch mountain \"Lachin Y Gair,\" has\r\ntwo Ossianic lines in quotation points--\r\n\r\n    \"Shades of the dead! have I not heard your voices\r\n      Rise on the night-rolling breath of the gale?\"\r\n\r\nByron attributed much importance to his early recollections of Highland\r\nscenery, which he said had prepared him to love the Alps and \"blue\r\nFriuli's mountains,\" and \"the Acroceraunian mountains of old name.\"  But\r\nthe influence of Ossian upon Byron and his older contemporaries was\r\nmanifested in subtler ways than in formal imitations.  It fell in with\r\nthat current of feeling which Carlyle called \"Wertherism,\" and helped to\r\nswell it.  It chimed with the tone that sounds through the German _Sturm\r\nund Drang_ period; that impatience of restraint, that longing to give\r\nfull swing to the claims of the elementary passions, and that desperation\r\nwhen these are checked by the arrangements of modern society, which we\r\nencounter in Rousseau and the young Goethe.  Hence the romantic gloom,\r\nthe Byronic _Zerrissenheit_, to use Heine's word, which drove the poet\r\nfrom the rubs of social life to waste places of nature and sometimes to\r\nsuicide.  In such a mood the mind recurred to the language of Ossian, as\r\nthe fit expression of its own indefinite and stormy griefs.\r\n\r\n\"Homer,\" writes Werther, \"has been superseded in my heart by the divine\r\nOssian.  Through what a world does this angelic bard carry me!  With him\r\nI wander over barren wastes and frightful wilds; surrounded by whirlwinds\r\nand hurricanes, trace by the feeble light of the moon the shades of our\r\nnoble ancestors; hear from the mountainous heights, intermingled with the\r\nroaring of waves and cataracts, their plaintive tones stealing from\r\ncavernous recesses; while the pensive monody of some love-stricken\r\nmaiden, who heaves her departing sighs over the moss-clad grave of the\r\nwarrior by whom she was adored, makes up the inarticulate concert.  I\r\ntrace this bard, with his silver locks, as he wanders in the valley and\r\nexplores the footsteps of his fathers.  Alas! no vestige remains but\r\ntheir tombs.  His thought then hangs on the silver moon, as her sinking\r\nbeams play upon the rippling main; and the remembrance of deeds past and\r\ngone recurs to the hero's mind--deeds of times when he gloried in the\r\napproach of danger, and emulation nerved his whole frame; when the pale\r\norb shone upon his bark, laden with the spoils of his enemy, and\r\nilluminated his triumphant return.  When I see depicted on his\r\ncountenance a bosom full of woe; when I behold his heroic greatness\r\nsinking into the grave, and he exclaims, as he throws a glance at the\r\ncold sod which is to lie upon him: 'Hither will the traveler who is\r\nsensible of my worth bend his weary steps, and seek the soul-enlivening\r\nbard, the illustrious son of Fingal; his foot will tread upon my tomb,\r\nbut his eyes shall never behold me'; at this time it is, my dear friend,\r\nthat, like some renowned and chivalrous knight, I could instantly draw my\r\nsword; rescue my prince from a long, irksome existence of languor and\r\npain; and then finish by plunging the weapon into my own breast, that I\r\nmight accompany the demi-god whom my hand had emancipated.\"[28]\r\n\r\nIn his last interview with Charlotte, Werther, who had already determined\r\nupon suicide, reads aloud to her, from \"The Songs of Selma,\" \"that tender\r\npassage wherein Armin deplores the loss of his beloved daughter.  'Alone\r\non the sea-beat rocks, my daughter was heard to complain.  Frequent and\r\nloud were her cries.  What could her father do?  All night I stood on the\r\nshore.  I saw her by the faint beam of the moon,'\" etc.  The reading is\r\ninterrupted by a mutual flood of tears.  \"They traced the similitude of\r\ntheir own misfortune in this unhappy tale. . .  The pointed allusion of\r\nthose words to the situation of Werther rushed with all the electric\r\nrapidity of lightning to the inmost recesses of his soul.\"\r\n\r\nIt is significant that one of Ossian's most fervent admirers was\r\nChateaubriand, who has been called the inventor of modern melancholy and\r\nof the primeval forest.  Here is a passage from his \"Génie du\r\nChristianisme\":[29] \"Under a cloudy sky, on the coast of that sea whose\r\ntempests were sung by Ossian, their Gothic architecture has something\r\ngrand and somber.  Seated on a shattered altar in the Orkneys, the\r\ntraveler is astonished at the dreariness of those places: sudden fogs,\r\nvales where rises the sepulchral stone, streams flowing through wild\r\nheaths, a few reddish pine trees, scattered over a naked desert studded\r\nwith patches of snow; such are the only objects which present themselves\r\nto his view.  The wind circulates among the ruins, and their innumerable\r\ncrevices become so many tubes, which heave a thousand sighs.  Long\r\ngrasses wave in the apertures of the domes, and beyond these apertures\r\nyou behold the flitting clouds and the soaring sea-eagle. . .  Long will\r\nthose four stones which mark the tombs of heroes on the moors of\r\nCaledonia, long will they continue to attract the contemplative traveler.\r\nOscar and Malvina are gone, but nothing is changed in their solitary\r\ncountry.  'Tis no longer the hand of the bard himself that sweeps the\r\nharp; the tones we hear are the slight trembling of the strings, produced\r\nby the touch of a spirit, when announcing at night, in a lonely chamber,\r\nthe death of a hero. . .  So when he sits in the silence of noon in the\r\nvalley of his breezes is the murmur of the mountain to Ossian's ear: the\r\ngale drowns it often in its course, but the pleasant sound returns again.\"\r\n\r\nIn Byron's passion for night and tempest, for the wilderness, the\r\nmountains, and the sea, it is of course impossible to say how large a\r\nshare is attributable directly to MacPherson's \"Ossian,\" or more\r\nremotely, through Chateaubriand and other inheritors of the Ossianic\r\nmood.  The influence of any particular book becomes dispersed and blended\r\nwith a hundred currents that are in the air.  But I think one has often a\r\nconsciousness of Ossian in reading such passages as the famous apostrophe\r\nto the ocean in \"Childe Harold\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!\"--\r\n\r\nWhich recalls the address to the sun in Carthous--\"O thou that rollest\r\nabove, round as the shield of my fathers,\"--perhaps the most hackneyed\r\n_locus classicus_ in the entire work; or as the lines beginning,\r\n\r\n    \"O that the desert were my dwelling place;\"[30]\r\n\r\nor the description of the storm in the Jura:\r\n\r\n    \"And this is in the night: Most glorious night!\r\n    Thou wert not sent for slumber.  Let me be\r\n    A sharer in thy fierce and far delight\r\n    A portion of the tempest and of thee.\"[30]\r\n\r\nWalter Scott, while yet a lad, made acquaintance with Ossian through Dr.\r\nBlacklock, and was at first delighted; but \"the tawdry repetitions of the\r\nOssianic phraseology,\" he confesses, \"disgusted me rather sooner than\r\nmight have been expected from my age.\"  He afterward contributed an essay\r\non the authenticity of the poems to the proceedings of the Speculative\r\nClub of Edinburgh.  In one sense of the word Scott was the most romantic\r\nof romanticists; but in another sense he was very little romantic, and\r\nthere was not much in his sane, cheerful, and robust nature upon which\r\nsuch poetry as Ossian could fasten.[31]  It is just at this point,\r\nindeed, that definitions diverge and the two streams of romantic tendency\r\npart company.  These Carlyle has called \"Wertherism\" and \"Götzism\"[32]\r\n_i.e._ sentimentalism and mediaevalism, though so mild a word as\r\nsentimentalism fails to express adequately the morbid despair to which\r\n\"Werther\" gave utterance, and has associations with works of a very\r\ndifferent kind, such as the fictions of Richardson and Sterne.  In\r\nEngland, Scott became the foremost representative of \"Götzism,\" and Byron\r\nof \"Wertherism.\"  The pessimistic, sardonic heroes of \"Manfred,\" \"Childe\r\nHarold,\" and \"The Corsair\" were the latest results of the \"Il Penseroso\"\r\nliterature, and their melodramatic excesses already foretokened a\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nAmong other testimonies to Ossian's popularity in England are the\r\nnumerous experiments at versifying MacPherson's prose.  These were not\r\nover-successful and only a few of them require mention here.  The Rev.\r\nJohn Wodrow, a Scotch minister, \"attempted\" \"Carthon,\" \"The Death of\r\nCuthullin\" and \"Darthula\" in heroic couplets, in 1769; and \"Fingal\" in\r\n1771.  In the preface to his \"Fingal,\" he maintained that there was no\r\nreasonable doubt of the antiquity and authenticity of MacPherson's\r\n\"Ossian.\"  \"Fingal\"--which seems to have been the favorite--was again\r\nturned into heroic couplets by Ewen Cameron, in 1776, prefaced by the\r\nattestations of a number of Highland gentlemen to the genuineness of the\r\noriginals; and by an argumentative introduction, in which the author\r\nquotes Dr. Blair's _dictum_ that Ossian was the equal of Homer and Vergil\r\n\"in strength of imagination, in grandeur of sentiment, and in native\r\nmajesty of passion.\"  National pride enlisted most of the Scotch scholars\r\non the affirmative side of the question, and made the authenticity of\r\nOssian almost an article of belief.  Wodrow's heroics were merely\r\nrespectable.  The quality of Cameron's may be guessed from a half dozen\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    \"When Moran, one commissioned to explore\r\n    The distant seas, came running from the shore\r\n    And thus exclaimed--'Cuthullin, rise!  The ships\r\n    Of snowy Lochlin hide the rolling deeps.\r\n    Innumerable foes the land invade,\r\n    And Swaran seems determined to succeed.'\"\r\n\r\nWhatever impressiveness belonged to MacPherson's cadenced prose was lost\r\nin these metrical versions, which furnish a perfect _reductio ad\r\nabsurdum_ of the critical folly that compared Ossian with Homer.  Homer\r\ncould not be put in any dress through which the beauty and interest of\r\nthe original would not appear.  Still again, in 1786, \"Fingal\" was done\r\ninto heroics by a Mr. R. Hole, who varied his measures with occasional\r\nballad stanzas, thus:\r\n\r\n    \"But many a fair shall melt with woe\r\n      At thy soft strain in future days,\r\n    And many a manly bosom glow,\r\n      Congenial to thy lofty lays.\"\r\n\r\nThese versions were all emitted in Scotland.  But as late as 1814\r\n\"Fingal\" appeared once more in verse, this time in London, and in a\r\nvariety of meters by Mr. George Harvey; who, in his preface, expressed\r\nthe hope that Walter Scott would feel moved to cast \"Ossian\" into the\r\nform of a metrical romance, like \"Marmion\" or \"The Lay of the Last\r\nMinstrel.\"  The best English poem constructed from MacPherson is \"The Six\r\nBards of Ossian Versified,\" by Sir Egerton Brydges (dated in 1784).[33]\r\nThe passage selected was the one which Gray so greatly admired,[34] from\r\na note to \"Croma,\" in the original \"Fragments.\"  Six bards who have met\r\nat the hall of a chieftain, on an October night, go out one after another\r\nto observe the weather, and return to report their observations, each\r\nending with the refrain \"Receive me from the night, my friends.\"  The\r\nwhole episode is singularly arresting, and carries a conviction of\r\nreality too often wanting in the epic portions of MacPherson's collection.\r\n\r\nWalpole, at first, was nearly as much charmed by the \"Fragments\" as Gray\r\nhad been.  He wrote to Dalrymple that they were real poetry, natural\r\npoetry, like the poetry of the East.  He liked particularly the synonym\r\nfor an echo--\"son of the rock\"; and in a later letter he said that all\r\ndoubts which he might once have entertained as to their genuineness had\r\ndisappeared.  But Walpole's literary judgments were notoriously\r\ncapricious.  In his subsequent correspondence with Mason and others, he\r\nbecame very contemptuous of MacPherson's \"cold skeleton of an epic poem,\r\nthat is more insipid than 'Leonidas.'\"  \"Ossian,\" he tells Mason, in a\r\nletter dated March, 1783, has become quite incredible to him; but Mrs.\r\nMontagu--the founder of the Blue Stocking Club--still \"holds her feast of\r\nshells in her feather dressing-room.\"\r\n\r\nThe Celtic Homer met with an even warmer welcome abroad than at home.  He\r\nwas rendered into French,[35] German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Polish,\r\nand possibly other languages.  Bonaparte was a great lover of Ossian, and\r\ncarried about with him a copy of Cesarotti's Italian version.  A\r\nresemblance has been fancied between MacPherson's manner and the\r\ngrandiloquent style of Bonaparte's bulletins and dispatches.[36]  In\r\nGermany Ossian naturally took most strongly.  He was translated into\r\nhexameters by a Vienna Jesuit named Michael Denis[37] and produced many\r\nimitations.  Herder gave three translations from \"Ossian\" in his \"Stimmen\r\nder Völker\" (1778-79) and prefixed to the whole collection an essay\r\n\"Ueber Ossian und die Lieder alter Völker\" written in 1773.  Schiller was\r\none of the converts; Klopstock and his circle called themselves \"bards\";\r\nand an exclamatory and violent mannerism came into vogue, known in German\r\nliterary history as _Bardengebrüll_.  MacPherson's personal history need\r\nnot be followed here in detail.  In 1764 he went to Pensacola as\r\nsecretary to Governor Johnston.  He was afterward a government\r\npamphleteer, writing against Junius and in favor of taxing the American\r\ncolonies.  He was appointed agent to the Nabob of Arcot; sat in\r\nParliament for the borough of Camelford, and built a handsome Italian\r\nvilla in his native parish; died in 1796, leaving a large fortune, and\r\nwas buried in Westminster Abbey.  In 1773 he was ill-advised enough to\r\nrender the \"Iliad\" into Ossianic prose.  The translation was overwhelmed\r\nwith ridicule, and probably did much to increase the growing disbelief in\r\nthe genuineness of \"Fingal\" and \"Temora.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Fragments of Ancient Poetry collected in the Highlands of Scotland,\r\nand translated from the Gaelic or Erse language.\" Edinburgh, MDCCLX. 70\r\npp.\r\n\r\n[2] This was sent him by MacPherson and was a passage not given in the\r\n\"Fragments.\"\r\n\r\n[3] From \"Carthon.\"\r\n\r\n[4] Scandinavia\r\n\r\n[5] An unconscious hexameter.\r\n\r\n[6] From \"Fingal\" book ii.\r\n\r\n[7] See the dissertation by Rev.

It shows by what process\r\nantiquarianism became poetry.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the story was the ancient city of Bristol--old Saxon\r\n_Bricgestowe_, \"place of the bridge\"--bridge, namely, over the Avon\r\nstream, not far above its confluence with the Severn.  Here Chatterton\r\nwas born in 1752, the posthumous son of a dissipated schoolmaster, whose\r\nancestors for a hundred and fifty years had been, in unbroken succession,\r\nsextons to the church of St. Mary Redcliffe.  Perhaps it may be more than\r\nan idle fancy to attribute to heredity the bent which Chatterton's genius\r\ntook spontaneously and almost from infancy; to guess that some mysterious\r\nante-natal influence--\"striking the electric chain wherewith we are\r\ndarkly bound\"--may have set vibrating links of unconscious association\r\nrunning back through the centuries.  Be this as it may, Chatterton was\r\nthe child of Redcliffe Church.  St. Mary stood by his cradle and rocked\r\nit; and if he did not inherit with his blood, or draw in with his\r\nmother's milk a veneration for her ancient pile; at least the waters of\r\nher baptismal font[2] seemed to have signed him with the token of her\r\nservice.  Just as truly as \"The Castle of Otranto\" was sprung from\r\nStrawberry Hill, the Rowley poems were born of St. Mary's Church.\r\n\r\nChatterton's father had not succeeded to the sextonship, but he was a\r\nsub-chanter in Bristol Cathedral, and his house and school in Pile Street\r\nwere only a few yards from Redcliffe Church.  In this house Chatterton\r\nwas born, under the eaves almost of the sanctuary; and when his mother\r\nremoved soon after to another house, where she maintained herself by\r\nkeeping a little dame's school and doing needle work, it was still on\r\nRedcliffe Hill and in close neighborhood to St. Mary's.  The church\r\nitself--\"the pride of Bristowe and the western land\"--is described as\r\n\"one of the finest parish churches in England,\"[3] a rich specimen of\r\nlate Gothic or \"decorated\" style; its building or restoration dating from\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century.  Chatterton's uncle by marriage,\r\nRichard Phillips, had become sexton in 1748, and the boy had the run of\r\nthe aisles and transepts.  The stone effigies of knights, priests,\r\nmagistrates, and other ancient civic worthies stirred into life under his\r\nintense and brooding imagination; his mind took color from the red and\r\nblue patterns thrown on the pavement by the stained glass of the windows;\r\nand he may well have spelled out much of the little Latin that he knew\r\nfrom \"the knightly brasses of the tombs\" and \"cold _hic jacets_ of the\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious how early his education was self-determined to its peculiar\r\nends.  A dreamy, silent, solitary child, given to fits of moodiness, he\r\nwas accounted dull and even stupid.  He would not, or could not, learn\r\nhis letters until, in his seventh year, his eye was caught by the\r\nilluminated capitals in an old music folio.  From these his mother taught\r\nhim the alphabet, and a little later he learned to read from a\r\nblack-letter Bible.  \"Paint me an angel with wings and a trumpet,\" he\r\nanswered, when asked what device he would choose for the little\r\nearthenware bowl that had been promised him as a gift.[4]  Colston's\r\nHospital, where he was put to school, was built on the site of a\r\ndemolished monastery of Carmelite Friars; the scholars wore blue coats,\r\nwith metal plates on their breasts stamped with the image of a dolphin,\r\nthe armorial crest of the founder, and had their hair cropped short in\r\nimitation of the monkish tonsure.  As the boy grew into a youth, there\r\nwere numbered among his near acquaintances, along with the vintners,\r\nsugar-bakers, pipe-makers, apothecaries, and other tradesmen of the\r\nBristol _bourgeoisie_, two church organists, a miniature painter, and an\r\nengraver of coats-of-arms--figures quaintly suggestive of that mingling\r\nof municipal life and ecclesiastical-mediaeval art which is reproduced in\r\nthe Rowley poems.\r\n\r\n\"Chatterton,\" testifies one of his early acquaintances, \"was fond of\r\nwalking in the fields, particularly in Redcliffe meadows, and of talking\r\nof his manuscripts, and sometimes reading them there.  There was one spot\r\nin particular, full in view of the church, in which he seemed to take a\r\npeculiar delight.  He would frequently lay himself down, fix his eyes\r\nupon the church, and seem as if he were in a kind of trance.  Then on a\r\nsudden he would tell me: 'That steeple was burnt down by lightning: that\r\nwas the place where they formerly acted plays.'\"  \"Among his early\r\nstudies,\" we are told, \"antiquities, and especially the surroundings of\r\nmedieval life, were the favorite subjects; heraldry seems especially to\r\nhave had a fascination for him.  He supplied himself with charcoal,\r\nblack-lead, ochre, and other colors; and with these it was his delight to\r\ndelineate, in rough and quaint figures, churches, castles, tombs of\r\nmailed warriors, heraldic emblazonments, and other like belongings of the\r\nold world.\"[5]\r\n\r\nIs there not a breath of the cloister in all this, reminding one of the\r\nchild martyr in Chaucer's \"Prioresse Tale,\" the \"litel clergeon, seven\r\nyeer of age\"?\r\n\r\n    \"This litel child his litel book lerninge,\r\n    As he sat in the scole at his prymer,\r\n    He 'Alma redemptoris' herde singe,\r\n    As children lerned hir antiphoner.\"\r\n\r\nA choir boy bred in cathedral closes, catching his glimpses of the sky\r\nnot through green boughs, but through the treetops of the Episcopal\r\ngardens discolored by the lancet windows of the clear-stories; dreaming\r\nin the organ loft in the pauses of the music, when\r\n\r\n        \"The choristers, sitting with faces aslant,\r\n    Feel the silence to consecrate more than the chant.\"\r\n\r\nThus Chatterton's sensitive genius was taking the impress of its\r\nenvironment.  As he pored upon the antiquities of his native city, the\r\nidea of its life did sweetly creep into his study of imagination; and he\r\ngradually constructed for himself a picture of fifteenth-century Bristol,\r\nincluding a group of figures, partly historical and partly fabulous, all\r\ncentering about Master William Canynge.  Canynge was the rich Bristol\r\nmerchant who founded or restored St. Mary Redcliffe's; was several times\r\nmayor of the city in the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward IV., and once\r\nrepresented the borough in Parliament.  Chatterton found or fabled that\r\nhe at length took holy orders and became dean of Westbury College.  About\r\nCanynge Chatterton arranged a number of _dramatis personae_, some of\r\nwhose names he discovered in old records and documents, such as\r\nCarpenter, Bishop of Worcester, and Sir Theobald Gorges, a knight of\r\nWraxhall, near Bristol; together with others entirely of his own\r\ninvention--as John a Iscam, whom he represents to have been a canon of\r\nSt. Augustine's Abbey in Bristol; and especially one Thomas Rowley,\r\nparish priest of St. John's, employed by Canynge to collect manuscripts\r\nand antiquities.  He was his poet laureate and father confessor, and to\r\nhim Chatterton ascribed most of the verses which pass under the general\r\nname of the Rowley poems.  But Iscam was also a poet and Master Canynge\r\nhimself sometimes burst into song.  Samples of the Iscam and the Canynge\r\nmuse diversify the collection.  The great Bristol merchant was a\r\nmediaeval Maecenas, and at his house, \"nempned the Red Lodge,\" were\r\nplayed interludes--\"Aella,\" \"Goddwyn,\" and \"The Parliament of\r\nSprites\"--composed by Rowley, or by Rowley and Iscam collaborating.\r\nCanynge sometimes wrote the prologues; and Rowley fed his patron with\r\nsoft dedication and complimentary verses: \"On Our Lady's Church,\" \"Letter\r\nto the dygne Master Canynge,\" \"The Account of W. Canynges Feast,\" etc.\r\nThe well-known fifteenth-century poet Lydgate is also introduced into\r\nthis literary _cénacle_, as John Ladgate, and made to exchange verse\r\nepistles with Rowley in eighteenth-century fashion.  Such is the\r\nremarkable fiction which the marvelous boy erected, as a scaffolding for\r\nthe fabric of sham-antique poetry and prose, which he build up during the\r\nyears 1767 to 1770, _i.e._, from the fifteenth to the eighteenth year of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide distance between the achievements of this untaught lad of\r\nhumble birth and narrow opportunities, and the works of the great Sir\r\nWalter, with his matured powers and his stores of solid antiquarian lore.\r\nBut the impulse that conducted them to their not dissimilar tasks was the\r\nsame.  In \"Yarrow Revisited,\" Wordsworth uses, _à propos_ of Scott, the\r\nexpression \"localized romance.\"  It was, indeed, the absorbing local\r\nfeeling of Scott, his patriotism, his family pride, his attachment to the\r\nsoil, that brought passion and poetry into his historical pursuits.  With\r\nChatterton, too, this absorption in the past derived its intensity from\r\nhis love of place.  Bristol was his world; in \"The Battle of Hastings,\"\r\nhe did not forget to introduce a Bristowan contingent, led by a certain\r\nfabulous Alfwold, and performing prodigies of valor upon the Normans.\r\nThe image of mediaeval life which he succeeded in creating was, of\r\ncourse, a poor, faint _simulacrum_, compared with Scott's.  He lacked\r\nknowledge, leisure, friends, long life--everything that was needed to\r\ngive his work solidity.  All that he had was a creative, though\r\nundisciplined imagination, together with an astonishing industry,\r\npersistence, and secretiveness.  Yet with all his disadvantages, his\r\nwork, with all its imperfections, is far more striking than the imitative\r\nverse of the Wartons, or the thin, diffused medievalism of Walpole and\r\nClara Reeve.  It is the product of a more original mind and a more\r\nintense conception.\r\n\r\nIn the muniment room over the north porch of St. Mary Redcliffe's were\r\nseveral old chests filled with parchments: architectural memoranda,\r\nchurch-wardens' accounts, inventories of vestments, and similar parish\r\ndocuments.  One of these chests, known as Master Canynge's coffer, had\r\nbeen broken open some years before, and whatever was of value among its\r\ncontents removed to a place of safety.  The remainder of the parchments\r\nhad been left scattered about, and Chatterton's father had carried a\r\nnumber of them home and used them to cover copy-books.  The boy's eye was\r\nattracted by these yellow sheep-skins, with their antique script; he\r\nappropriated them and kept them locked up in his room.\r\n\r\nHow early he conceived the idea of making this treasure-trove responsible\r\nfor the Rowley myth, which was beginning to take shape in his mind, is\r\nuncertain.  According to the testimony of a schoolfellow, by name\r\nThistlethwaite, Chatterton told him in the summer of 1764 that he had a\r\nnumber of old manuscripts, found in a chest in Redcliffe Church, and that\r\nhe had lent one of them to Thomas Philips, an usher in Colston's\r\nHospital.  Thistlethwaite says that Philips showed him this manuscript, a\r\npiece of vellum pared close around the edge, on which was traced in pale\r\nand yellow writing, as if faded with age, a poem which he thinks\r\nidentical with \"Elinoure and Juga,\" afterward published by Chatterton in\r\nthe _Town and Country Magazine_ for May, 1769.  One is inclined to\r\ndistrust this evidence.  \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published in\r\nDecember, 1764, and the \"Reliques,\" only in the year following.  The\r\nlatter was certainly known to Chatterton; many of the Rowley poems, \"The\r\nBristowe Tragedie,\" _e.g._, and the ministrel songs in \"Aella,\" show\r\nballad influence[6]; while it seems not unlikely that Chatterton was\r\nmoved to take a hint from the disguise--slight as it was--assumed by\r\nWalpole in the preface to his romance.[7]  But perhaps this was not\r\nneeded to suggest to Chatterton that the surest way to win attention to\r\nhis poems would be to ascribe them to some fictitious bard of the Middle\r\nAges.  It was the day of literary forgery; the Ossian controversy was\r\nraging, and the tide of popular favor set strongly toward the antique.  A\r\nseries of avowed imitations of old English poetry, however clever, would\r\nhave had small success.  But the discovery of a hitherto unknown\r\nfifteen-century poet was an announcement sure to interest the learned and\r\nperhaps a large part of the reading public.  Besides, instances are not\r\nrare where a writer has done his best work under a mask.  The poems\r\ncomposed by Chatterton in the disguise of Rowley--a dramatically imagined\r\n_persona_ behind which he lost his own identity--are full of a curious\r\nattractiveness; while his acknowledged pieces are naught.  It is not\r\nworth while to bear down very heavily on the moral aspects of this kind\r\nof deception.  The question is one of literary methods rather than of\r\nethics.  If the writer succeeds by the skill of his imitations, and the\r\ningenuity of the evidence that he brings to support them, in actually\r\nimposing upon the public for a time, the success justifies the attempt.\r\nThe artist's purpose is to create a certain impression, and the choice of\r\nmeans must be left to himself.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1764 Chatterton was barely twelve, and wonderful as his\r\nprecocity was, it is doubtful whether he had got so far in the evolution\r\nof the Rowley legend as Thistlethwaite's story would imply.  But it is\r\ncertain that three years later, in the spring of 1767, Chatterton gave\r\nMr. Henry Burgum, a worthy pewterer of Bristol, a parchment emblazoned\r\nwith the \"de Bergham,\" coat-of-arms, which he pretended to have found in\r\nSt. Mary's Church, furnishing him also with two copy-books, in which were\r\ntranscribed the \"de Bergham,\" pedigree, together with three poems in\r\npseudo-antique spelling.  One of these, \"The Tournament,\" described a\r\njoust in which figured one Sir Johan de Berghamme, a presumable ancestor\r\nof the gratified pewterer.  Another of them, \"The Romaunte of the\r\nCnyghte,\" purported to be the work of this hero of the tilt-yard, \"who\r\nspent his whole life in tilting,\" but notwithstanding found time to write\r\nseveral books and translate \"some part of the Iliad under the title\r\n'Romance of Troy.'\"\r\n\r\nAll this stuff was greedily swallowed by Burgum, and the marvelous boy\r\nnext proceeded to befool Mr. William Barrett, a surgeon and antiquary who\r\nwas engaged in writing a history of Bristol.  To him he supplied copies\r\nof supposed documents in the muniment room of Redcliffe Church: \"Of the\r\nAuntiaunte Forme of Monies,\" and the like: deeds, bills, letters,\r\ninscriptions, proclamations, accounts of churches and other buildings,\r\ncollected by Rowley for his patron, Canynge: many of which this\r\nsingularly uncritical historian incorporated in his \"History of Bristol,\"\r\npublished some twenty years later.  He also imparted to Barrett two\r\nRowleian poems, \"The Parliament of Sprites,\" and \"The Battle of Hastings\"\r\n(in two quite different versions).  In September, 1768, a new bridge was\r\nopened at Bristol over the Avon; and Chatterton, who had now been\r\napprenticed to an attorney, took advantage of the occasion to send\r\nanonymously to the printer of _Farley's Bristol Journal_ a description of\r\nthe mayor's first passing over the old bridge in the reign of Henry II.\r\nThis was composed in obsolete language and alleged to have been copied\r\nfrom a contemporary manuscript.  It was the first published of\r\nChatterton's fabrications.  In the years 1768-69 he produced and gave to\r\nMr. George Catcott the long tragical interude \"Aella,\" \"The Bristowe\r\nTragedie,\" and other shorter pieces, all of which he declared to be\r\ntranscripts from manuscripts in Canynge's chest, and the work of Thomas\r\nRowley, a secular priest of Bristol, who flourished about 1460.  Catcott\r\nwas a local book-collector and the partner of Mr. Burgum.  He was\r\nsubsequently nicknamed \"Rowley's midwife.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1768, Chatterton opened a correspondence with James Dodsley,\r\nthe London publisher, saying that several ancient poems had fallen into\r\nhis hands, copies of which he offered to supply him, if he would send a\r\nguinea to cover expenses.  He inclosed a specimen of \"Aella.\"  \"The\r\nmotive that actuates me to do this,\" he wrote, \"is to convince the world\r\nthat the monks (of whom some have so despicable an opinion) were not such\r\nblockheads as generally thought, and that good poetry might be wrote in\r\nthe dark days of superstition, as well as in these more enlightened\r\nages.\"  Dodsley took no notice of the letters, and the owner of the\r\nRowley manuscripts next turned to Horace Walpole, whose tastes as a\r\nvirtuoso, a lover of Gothic, and a romancer might be counted on to enlist\r\nhis curiosity in Chatterton's find.  The document which he prepared for\r\nWalpole was a prose paper entitled \"The Ryse of Peyncteynge yn Englande,\r\nwroten by T. Rowleie, 1469, for Mastre Canynge,\" and containing _inter\r\nalia_, the following extraordinary \"anecdote of painting\" about Afflem,\r\nan Anglo-Saxon glass-stainer of Edmond's reign who was taken prisoner by\r\nthe Danes.  \"Inkarde, a soldyer of the Danes, was to slea hym; onne the\r\nNete before the Feeste of Deathe hee founde Afflem to bee hys Broder\r\nAffrighte chanynede uppe hys soule.  Gastnesse dwelled yn his Breaste.\r\nOscarre, the greate Dane, gave hest hee shulde bee forslagene with the\r\ncommeynge Sunne: no tears colde availe; the morne cladde yn roabes of\r\nghastness was come, whan the Danique Kynge behested Oscarre to arraie hys\r\nKnyghtes eftsoones for Warre.

Shake thie Sworde,\r\n      Bare this mortheynge steinede honde,' etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole was inclosed in a short note to Walpole, which ran thus:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, Being versed a little in antiquitys, I have met with several\r\ncurious manuscripts, among which the following may be of Service to you,\r\nin any future Edition of your truly entertaining Anecdotes of\r\nPainting.[9]  In correcting the mistakes (if any) in the Notes, you will\r\ngreatly oblige\r\n                Your most humble Servant,\r\n                        Thomas Chatterton.\"\r\n\r\nWalpole replied civilly, thanking his correspondent for what he had sent\r\nand for his offer of communicating his manuscripts, but disclaiming any\r\nability to correct Chatterton's notes.  \"I have not the happiness of\r\nunderstanding the Saxon language, and, without your learned notes, should\r\nnot have been able to comprehend Rowley's text.\"  He asks where Rowley's\r\npoems are to be found, offers to print them, and pronounces the Abbot\r\nJohn's verses \"wonderful for their harmony and spirit.\"  This\r\nencouragement called out a second letter from Chatterton, with another\r\nand longer extract from the \"Historie of Peyncteynge yn Englande,\"\r\nincluding translations into the Rowley dialect of passages from a pair of\r\nmythical Saxon poets: Ecca, Bishop of Hereford, and Elmar, Bishop of\r\nSelseie, \"fetyve yn Workes of ghastlienesse,\" as _ecce signum_:\r\n\r\n    \"Nowe maie alle Helle open to golpe thee downe,\" etc.\r\n\r\nBut by this time Walpole had begun to suspect imposture.  He had been\r\nlately bitten in the Ossian business and had grown wary in consequence.\r\nMoreover, Chatterton had been incautious enough to show his hand in his\r\nsecond letter (March 30).  \"He informed me,\" said Walpole, in his history\r\nof the affair, \"that he was the son of a poor widow . . . that he was\r\nclerk or apprentice to an attorney, but had a taste and turn for more\r\nelegant studies; and hinted a wish that I would assist him with my\r\ninterest in emerging out of so dull a profession, by procuring him\r\nsomeplace.\"  Meanwhile, distrusting his own scholarship, Walpole had\r\nshown the manuscripts to his friends Gray and Mason, who promptly\r\npronounced them modern fabrications and recommended him to return them\r\nwithout further notice.  But Walpole, good-naturedly considering that it\r\nwas no \"grave crime in a young bard to have forged false notes of hand\r\nthat were to pass current only in the parish of Parnassus,\" wrote his\r\ningenious correspondent a letter of well-meant advice, counseling him to\r\nstick to his profession, and saying that he \"had communicated his\r\ntranscripts to much better judges, and that they were by no means\r\nsatisfied with the authenticity of his supposed manuscripts.\"  Chatterton\r\nthen wrote for his manuscripts, and after some delay--Walpole having been\r\nabsent in Parish for several months--they were returned to him.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 Chatterton had begun contributing miscellaneous articles, in\r\nprose and verse, to the _Town and Country Magazine_, a London periodical.\r\nAmong these appeared the eclogue of \"Elinoure and Juga,\"[10] the only one\r\nof the Rowley poems printed during its author's lifetime.  He had now\r\nturned his pen to the service of politics, espousing the side of Wilkes\r\nand liberty.  In April, 1770, he left Bristol for London, and cast\r\nhimself upon the hazardous fortunes of a literary career.  Most tragical\r\nis the story of the poor, unfriended lad's struggle against fate for the\r\nnext few months.  He scribbled incessantly for the papers, receiving\r\nlittle or no pay.  Starvation confronted him; he was too proud to ask\r\nhelp, and on August 24 he took poison and died, at the age of seventeen\r\nyears and nine months.\r\n\r\nWith Chatterton's acknowledged writings we have nothing here to do; they\r\ninclude satires in the manner of Churchill, political letters in the\r\nmanner of Junius, squibs, lampoons, verse epistles, elegies, \"African\r\neclogues,\" a comic burletta, \"The Revenge\"--played at Marylebone Gardens\r\nshortly after his death--with essays and sketches in the style that the\r\n_Spectator_ and _Rambler_ had made familiar: \"The Adventures of a Star,\"\r\n\"The Memoirs of a Sad Dog,\" and the like.  They exhibit a precocious\r\ncleverness, but have no value and no interest today.  One gets from\r\nChatterton's letters and miscellanies an unpleasant impression of his\r\ncharacter.  There is not only the hectic quality of too early ripeness\r\nwhich one detects in Keats' correspondence; and the defiant swagger, the\r\naffectation of wickedness and knowingness that one encounters in the\r\nyouthful Byron, and that is apt to attend the stormy burst of irregular\r\ngenius upon the world; but there are things that imply a more radical\r\nunscrupulousness.  But it would be harsh to urge any such impressions\r\nagainst one who was no more than a boy when he perished, and whose brief\r\ncareer had struggled through cold obstruction to its bitter end.  The\r\nbest traits in Chatterton's character appear to have been his proud\r\nspirit of independence and his warm family affections.\r\n\r\nThe death of an obscure penny-a-liner, like young Chatterton, made little\r\nnoise at first.  But gradually it became rumored about in London literary\r\ncoteries that manuscripts of an interesting kind existed at Bristol,\r\npurporting to be transcripts from old English poems; and that the finder,\r\nor fabricator, of the same was the unhappy lad who had taken arsenic the\r\nother day, to anticipate a slower death from hunger.  It was in April,\r\n1771, that Walpole first heard of the fate of his would-be _protégé_.\r\n\"Dining,\" he says, \"at the Royal Academy, Dr. Goldsmith drew the\r\nattention of the company with an account of a marvelous treasure of\r\nancient poems lately discovered at Bristol, and expressed enthusiastic\r\nbelief in them; for which he was laughed at by Dr. Johnson, who was\r\npresent.  I soon found this was the _trouvaille_ of my friend Chatterton,\r\nand I told Dr. Goldsmith that this novelty was known to me, who might, if\r\nI had pleased, have had the honor of ushering the great discovery to the\r\nlearned world.  You may imagine, sir, we did not all agree in the measure\r\nof our faith; but though his credulity diverted me, my mirth was soon\r\ndashed; for, on asking about Chatterton, he told me he had been in London\r\nand had destroyed himself.\"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of \"Elinour and Juga,\" already mentioned, the Rowley\r\npoems were still unprinted.  The manuscripts, in Chatterton's\r\nhandwriting, were mostly in the possession of Barrett and Catcott.  They\r\npurported to be copies of Rowley's originals; but of these alleged\r\noriginals, the only specimens brought forward by Chatterton were a few\r\nscraps of parchment containing, in one instance, the first thirty-four\r\nlines of the poem entitled \"The Storie of William Canynge\"; in another a\r\nprose account of one \"Symonne de Byrtonne,\" and, in still others, the\r\nwhole of the short-verse pieces, \"Songe to Aella\" and \"The Accounte of W.\r\nCanynge's Feast.\"  These scraps of vellum are described as about six\r\ninches square, smeared with glue or brown varnish, or stained with ochre,\r\nto give them an appearance of age.  Thomas Warton had seen one of them,\r\nand pronounced it a clumsy forgery; the script not of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, but unmistakably modern.  Southey describes another as written,\r\nfor the most part, in an attorney's regular engrossing hand.  Mr. Skeat\r\n\"cannot find the slightest indication that Chatterton had ever seen a MS.\r\nof early date; on the contrary, he never uses the common contractions,\r\nand he was singularly addicted to the use of capitals, which in old MSS.\r\nare rather scarce.\"\r\n\r\nBoswell tells how he and Johnson went down to Bristol in April, 1776,\r\n\"where I was entertained with seeing him inquire upon the spot into the\r\nauthenticity of Rowley's poetry, as I had seen him inquire upon the spot\r\ninto the authenticity of Ossian's poetry.  Johnson said of Chatterton,\r\n'This is the most extraordinary young man that has encountered my\r\nknowledge.  It is wonderful how the whelp has written such things.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1777, seven years after Chatterton's death, his Rowley poems were\r\nfirst collected and published by Thomas Tyrwhitt, the Chaucerian editor,\r\nwho gave, in an appendix, his reasons for believing that Chatterton was\r\ntheir real author, and Rowley a myth.[11]  These reasons are convincing\r\nto any modern scholar.  Tyrwhitt's opinion was shared at the time by all\r\ncompetent authorities--Gray, Thomas Warton, and Malone, the editor of the\r\n_variorum_ Shakspere, among others.  Nevertheless, a controversy sprang\r\nup over Rowley, only less lively than the dispute about Ossian, which had\r\nbeen going on since 1760.  Rowley's most prominent champions were the\r\nRev. Dr. Symmes, who wrote in the _London Review_; the Rev. Dr. Sherwin,\r\nin the _Gentleman's Magazine_; Dr. Jacob Bryant,[12] and Jeremiah Milles,\r\nD.D., Dean of Exeter, who published a sumptuous quarto edition of the\r\npoems in 1782.[13]  These asserters of Rowley belonged to the class of\r\namateur scholars whom Edgar Poe used to speak of as \"cultivated old\r\nclergymen.\"  They had the usual classical training of Oxford and\r\nCambridge graduates, but no precise knowledge of old English literature.\r\nThey had the benevolent curiosity of Mr. Pickwick, and the\r\ngullibility--the large, easy swallow--which seems to go with the\r\nclerico-antiquarian habit of mind.\r\n\r\nNothing is so extinct as an extinct controversy; and, unlike the Ossian\r\npuzzle, which was a harder nut to crack, this Rowley controversy was\r\nreally settled from the start.  It is not essential to our purpose to\r\ngive any extended history of it.  The evidence relied upon by the\r\nsupporters of Rowley was mainly of the external kind:  personal\r\ntestimony, and especially the antecedent unlikeliness that a boy of\r\nChatterton's age and imperfect education could have reared such an\r\nelaborate structure of deceit; together with the inferiority of his\r\nacknowledged writings to the poems that he ascribed to Rowley.  But\r\nTyrwhitt was a scholar of unusual thoroughness and acuteness; and, having\r\na special acquaintance with early English, he was able to bring to the\r\ndecision of the question evidence of an internal nature which became more\r\nconvincing in proportion as the knowledge necessary to understand his\r\nargument increased; _i.e._, as the number of readers increased, who knew\r\nsomething about old English poetry.  Indeed, it was nothing but the\r\ngeneral ignorance of the spelling, flexions, vocabulary, and scansion of\r\nMiddle English verse, that made the controversy possible.\r\n\r\nTyrwhitt pointed out that the Rowleian dialect was not English of the\r\nfifteenth century, nor of any century, but a grotesque jumble of archaic\r\nwords of very different periods and dialects.  The orthography and\r\ngrammatical forms were such as occurred in no old English poet known to\r\nthe student of literature.  The fact that Rowley used constantly the\r\npossessive pronominal form _itts_, instead of _his_; or the other fact\r\nthat he used the termination _en_ in the singular of the verb, was alone\r\nenough to stamp the poems as spurious.  Tyrwhitt also showed that the\r\nsyntax, diction, idioms, and stanza forms were modern; that if modern\r\nwords were substituted throughout for the antique, and the spelling\r\nmodernized, the verse would read like eighteenth-century work.  \"If\r\nanyone,\" says Scott, in his review of the Southey and Cottle edition,\r\n\"resists the internal evidence of the style of Rowley's poems, we make\r\nhim welcome to the rest of the argument; to his belief that the Saxons\r\nimported heraldry and gave armorial bearings (which were not known till\r\nthe time of the Crusades); that Mr. Robert [_sic_] Canynge, in the reign\r\nof Edward IV., encouraged drawing and had private theatricals.\"  In this\r\narticle Scott points out a curious blunder of Chatterton's which has\r\nbecome historic, though it is only one of a thousand.  In the description\r\nof the cook in the General Prologue to the \"Canterbury Tales,\" Chaucer\r\nhad written:\r\n\r\n    \"But gret harm was it, as it thoughte me,\r\n    That on his schyne a mormal hadde he,\r\n    For blankmanger he made with the beste.\"\r\n\r\n_Mormal_, in this passage, means a cancerous sore, and _blankmanger_ is a\r\ncertain dish or confection--the modern _blancmange_.  But a confused\r\nrecollection of the whole was in Chatterton's mind, when among the\r\nfragments of paper and parchment which he covered with imitations of\r\nancient script, and which are now in the British Museum,--\"The Yellow\r\nRoll,\" \"The Purple Roll,\" etc.,--he inserted the following title in \"The\r\nRolls of St. Bartholomew's Priory,\" purporting to be old medical\r\nprescriptions; \"The cure of mormalles and the waterie leprosie; the rolle\r\nof the blacke mainger\"; turning Chaucer's innocent _blankmanger_ into\r\nsome kind of imaginary _black mange_.\r\n\r\nSkeat believes that Chatterton had read very little of Chaucer, probably\r\nonly a small portion of the Prologue to the \"Canterbury Tales.\"  \"If he\r\nhad really taken pains,\" he thinks, \"To _read_ and _study_ Chaucer of\r\nLydgate or any old author earlier than the age of Spenser, the Rowley\r\npoems would have been very different.  They would then have borne some\r\nresemblance to the language of the fifteenth century, whereas they are\r\nrather less like the language of that period than of any other.  The\r\nspelling of the words is frequently too late, or too bizarre, whilst many\r\nof the words themselves are too archaic or too uncommon.\"[14]  But this\r\ninternal evidence, which was so satisfactory to Scott, was so little\r\nconvincing to Chatterton's contemporaries that Tyrwhitt felt called upon\r\nto publish in 1782 a \"Vindication\" of his appendix; and Thomas Warton put\r\nforth in the same year an \"Enquiry,\" in which he reached practically the\r\nsame conclusions with Tyrwhitt.  And yet Warton had devoted the\r\ntwenty-sixth section of the second volume of his \"History of English\r\nPoetry\" (1778,) to a review of the Rowley poems, on the ground that \"as\r\nthey are held to be real by many respectable critics, it was his duty to\r\ngive them a place in this series\": a curious testimony to the uncertainty\r\nof the public mind on the question, and a half admission that the poems\r\nmight possibly turn out to be genuine.[15]\r\n\r\nTyrwhitt proved clearly enough that Chatterton wrote the Rowley poems,\r\nbut it was reserved for Mr. Skeat to show just _how_ he wrote them.  The\r\n_modus operandi_ was about as follows:  Chatterton first made, for his\r\nprivate use, a manuscript glossary, by copying out the words in the\r\nglossary to Speght's edition of Chaucer, and those marked as old in\r\nBailey's and Kersey's English Dictionaries.  Next he wrote his poem in\r\nmodern English, and finally rewrote it, substituting the archaic words\r\nfor their modern equivalents, and altering the spelling throughout into\r\nan exaggerated imitation of the antique spelling in Speght's Chaucer.\r\nThe mistakes that the he made are instructive, as showing how closely he\r\nfollowed his authorities, and how little independent knowledge he had of\r\ngenuine old English.  Thus, to give a few typical examples of the many in\r\nMr. Skeat's notes: in Kersey's dictionary occurs the word _gare_, defined\r\nas \"cause.\"  This is the verb _gar_, familiar to all readers of\r\nBurns,[16] and meaning to cause, to make; but Chatterton, taking it for\r\nthe _noun_, cause, employs it with grotesque incorrectness in such\r\nconnections as these:\r\n\r\n    \"Perchance in Virtue's gare rhyme might be then\":\r\n    \"If in this battle luck deserts our gare.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the Middle English _howten_ (Modern English, _hoot_) is defined by\r\nSpeght as \"hallow,\" _i.e._, halloo.  But Kersey and Bailey misprint this\r\n\"hollow\"; and Chatterton, entering it so in his manuscript list of old\r\nwords, evidently takes it to be the _adjective_ \"hollow\" and uses it thus\r\nin the line:\r\n\r\n    \"Houten are wordes for to telle his doe,\" _i.e._,\r\n    Hollow are words to tell his doings.\r\n\r\nStill again, in a passage already quoted,[17] it is told how the \"Wynde\r\nhurled the Battayle\"--Rowleian for a small boat--\"agaynste an Heck.\"\r\n_Heck_ in this and other passages was a puzzle.  From the context it\r\nobviously meant \"rock,\" but where did Chatterton get it?  Mr. Skeat\r\nexplains this.  _Heck_ is a provincial word signifying \"rack,\" i.e.,\r\n\"hay-rack\"; but Kersey misprinted it \"rock,\" and Chatterton followed him.\r\nA typical instance of the kind of error that Chatterton was perpetually\r\ncommitting was his understanding the \"Listed, bounded,\" _i.e., edged_ (as\r\nin the \"list\" or selvage of cloth) for \"bounded\" in the sense of\r\n_jumped,_ and so coining from it the verb \"to liss\"=to jump:\r\n\r\n    \"The headed javelin lisseth here and there.\"\r\n\r\nEvery page in the Rowley poems abounds in forms which would have been as\r\nstrange to an Englishman of the fifteenth as they are to one of the\r\nnineteenth century.  Adjectives are used for nouns, nouns for verbs, past\r\nparticiples for present infinitives; and derivatives and variants are\r\nemployed which never had any existence, such as _hopelen_=hopelessness,\r\nand _anere_=another.  Skeat says, that \"an analysis of the glossary in\r\nMilles's edition shows that the genuine old English words correctly used,\r\noccurring in the Rowleian dialect, amount to only about _seven_ per cent,\r\nof all the old words employed.\"  It is probable that, by constant use of\r\nhis manuscript glossary, the words became fixed in Chatterton's memory\r\nand he acquired some facility in composing at first hand in this odd\r\njargon.  Thus he uses the archaic words quite freely as rhyme words,\r\nwhich he would not have been likely to do unless he had formed the habit\r\nof thinking to some degree, in Rowleian.\r\n\r\nThe question now occurs, apart from the tragic interest of Chatterton's\r\ncareer, from the mystery connected with the incubation and hatching of\r\nthe Rowley poems, and from their value as records of a very unusual\r\nprecocity--what independent worth have they as poetry, and what has been\r\nthe extent of their literary influence?  The dust of controversy has long\r\nsince settled, and what has its subsidence made visible?  My own belief\r\nis that the Rowley poems are interesting principally as literary\r\ncuriosities--the work of an infant phenomenon--and that they have little\r\nimportance in themselves, or as models and inspirations to later poets.\r\nI cannot help thinking that, upon this subject, many critics have lost\r\ntheir heads.  Malone, _e.g._, pronounced Chatterton the greatest genius\r\nthat England had produced since Shakspere.  Professor Masson permits\r\nhimself to say: \"The antique poems of Chatterton are perhaps as worthy of\r\nbeing read consecutively as many portions of the poetry of Byron,\r\nShelley, or Keats.  There are passages in them, at least, quite equal to\r\nany to be found in these poets.\"[18]  Mr. Gosse seems to me much nearer\r\nthe truth: \"Our estimate of the complete originality of the Rowley poems\r\nmust be tempered by a recollection of the existence of 'The Castle of\r\nOtranto' and 'The Schoolmistress,' of the popularity of Percy's\r\n'Reliques' and the 'Odes' of Gray, and of the revival of a taste for\r\nGothic literature and art which dates from Chatterton's infancy.  Hence\r\nthe claim which has been made for Chatterton as the father of the\r\nromantic school, and as having influenced the actual style of Coleridge\r\nand Keats, though supported with great ability, appears to be\r\novercharged.  So also the positive praise given to the Rowley poems, as\r\nartistic productions full of rich color and romantic melody, may be\r\ndeprecated without any refusal to recognize these qualities in measure.\r\nThere are frequent flashes of brilliancy in Chatterton, and one or two\r\nvery perfectly sustained pieces; but the main part of his work, if\r\nrigorously isolated from the melodramatic romance of his career, is\r\nsurely found to be rather poor reading, the work of a child of exalted\r\ngenius, no doubt, yet manifestly the work of a child all through.\"[19]\r\n\r\nLet us get a little closer to the Rowley poems, as they stand in Mr.\r\nSkeat's edition, stripped of their sham-antique spelling and with their\r\nlanguage modernized wherever possible; and we shall find, I think, that\r\ntried by an absolute standard, they are markedly inferior not only to\r\ntrue mediaeval work like Chaucer's poems and the English and Scottish\r\nballads, but also to the best modern work conceived in the same spirit:\r\nto \"Christabel\" and \"The Eve of St. Agnes,\" and \"Jock o'Hazeldean\" and\r\n\"Sister Helen,\" and \"The Haystack in the Flood.\"  The longest of the\r\nRowley poems is \"Aella,\" \"a tragycal enterlude or discoorseynge tragedie\"\r\nin 147 stanzas, and generally regarded as Chatterton's masterpiece.[20]\r\nThe scene of this tragedy is Bristol and the neighboring Watchet Mead;\r\nthe period, during the Danish invasions.  The hero is the warden of\r\nBristol Castle.[21]  While he is absent on a victorious campaign against\r\nthe Danes, his bride, Bertha, is decoyed from home by his treacherous\r\nlieutenant, Celmond, who is about to ravish her in the forest, when he is\r\nsurprised and killed by a band of marauders.  Meanwhile Aella has\r\nreturned home, and finding that his wife has fled, stabs himself\r\nmortally.  Bertha arrives in time to hear his dying speech and make the\r\nnecessary explanations, and then dies herself on the body of her lord.\r\nIt will be seen that the plot is sufficiently melodramatic; the\r\nsentiments and dialogue are entirely modern, when translated out of\r\nRowleian into English.  The verse is a modified form of the Spenserian, a\r\nten-line stanza which Mr. Skeat says is an invention of Chatterton and a\r\nstriking instance of his originality.[22]  It answers very well in\r\ndescriptive passages and soliloquies; not so well in the \"discoorseynge\"\r\nparts.  As this is Chatterton's favorite stanza, in which \"The Battle of\r\nHastings,\" \"Goddwyn,\" \"English Metamorphosis\" and others of the Rowley\r\nseries are written, an example of it may be cited here, from \"Aella.\"\r\n\r\n        _Scene_, Bristol.  Celmond, _alone_.\r\n    The world is dark with night; the winds are still,\r\n    Faintly the moon her pallid light makes gleam;\r\n    The risen sprites the silent churchyard fill,\r\n    With elfin fairies joining in the dream;\r\n    The forest shineth with the silver leme;\r\n    Now may my love be sated in its treat;\r\n    Upon the brink of some swift running stream,\r\n    At the sweet banquet I will sweetly eat.\r\n    This is the house; quickly, ye hinds, appear.\r\n\r\n        _Enter_ a servant.\r\n\r\n    _Cel._ Go tell to Bertha straight, a stranger waiteth here.\r\n\r\nThe Rowley poems include, among other things, a number of dramatic or\r\nquasi-dramatic pieces, \"Goddwyn,\" \"The Tournament,\" \"The Parliament of\r\nSprites\"; the narrative poem of \"The Battle of Hastings,\" and a\r\ncollection of \"eclogues.\"  These are all in long-stanza forms, mostly in\r\nthe ten-lined stanza.  \"English Metamorphosis\" is an imitation of a\r\npassage in \"The Faërie Queene,\" (book ii. canto x. stanzas 5-19).  \"The\r\nParliament of Sprites\" is an interlude played by Carmelite friars at\r\nWilliam Canynge's house on the occasion of the dedication of St. Mary\r\nRedcliffe's.  One after another the _antichi spiriti dolenti_ rise up and\r\nsalute the new edifice: Nimrod and the Assyrians, Anglo-Saxon ealdormen\r\nand Norman knights templars, and citizens of ancient Bristol.  Among\r\nothers, \"Elle's sprite speaks\":\r\n\r\n    \"Were I once more cast in a mortal frame,\r\n    To hear the chantry-song sound in mine ear,\r\n    To hear the masses to our holy dame,\r\n    To view the cross-aisles and the arches fair!\r\n    Through the half-hidden silver-twinkling glare\r\n    Of yon bright moon in foggy mantles dressed,\r\n    I must content this building to aspere,[23]\r\n    Whilst broken clouds the holy sight arrest;\r\n    Till, as the nights grow old, I fly the light.\r\n    Oh! were I man again, to see the sight!\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most engaging of the Rowley poems are \"An Excelente Balade of\r\nCharitie,\" written in the rhyme royal; and \"The Bristowe Tragedie,\" in\r\nthe common ballad stanza, and said by Tyrwhitt to be founded on an\r\nhistorical fact: the excecution at Bristol, in 1461, of Sir Baldwin\r\nFulford, who fought on the Lancastrian side in the Wars of the Roses.\r\nThe best quality in Chatterton's verse is its unexpectedness,--sudden\r\nepithets or whole lines, of a wild and artless sweetness,--which goes far\r\nto explain the fascination that he exercised over Coleridge and Keats.  I\r\nmean such touches as these:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Once as I dozing in the witch-hour lay.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Brown as the filbert dropping from the shell.\"\r\n\r\n    \"My gorme emblanchèd with the comfreie plant.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Where thou may'st here the sweetè night-lark chant,\r\n    Or with some mocking brooklet sweetly glide.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Upon his bloody carnage-house he lay,\r\n    Whilst his long shield did gleam with the sun's rising ray.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The red y-painted oars from the black tide,\r\n    Carved with devices rare, do shimmering rise.\"\r\n\r\n    \"As elfin fairies, when the moon shines bright,\r\n    In little circles dance upon the green;\r\n    All living creatures fly far from their sight,\r\n    Nor by the race of destiny be seen;\r\n    For what he be that elfin fairies strike,\r\n    Their souls will wander to King Offa's dyke.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charming wildness of Chatterton's imagination--which attracted the\r\nnotice of that strange, visionary genius William Blake[24]--is perhaps\r\nseen at its best in one of the minstrel songs in \"Aella.\"  This is\r\nobviously an echo of Ophelia's song in \"Hamlet,\" but Chatterton gives it\r\na weird turn of his own:\r\n\r\n    \"Hark! the raven flaps his wing\r\n      In the briared dell below;\r\n    Hark! the death owl loud doth sing\r\n      To the nightmares, as they go.\r\n            My love is dead.\r\n          Gone to his death-bed\r\n          All under the willow tree.\r\n\r\n    \"See the white moon shines on high,[25]\r\n      Whiter is my true-love's shroud,\r\n    Whiter than the morning sky,\r\n      Whiter than the evening cloud.\r\n            My love is dead,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider briefly the influence of Chatterton's life and\r\nwritings upon his contemporaries and successors in the field of romantic\r\npoetry.  The dramatic features of his personal career drew, naturally,\r\nquite as much if not more attention than his literary legacy to\r\nposterity.  It was about nine years after his death that a clerical\r\ngentleman, Sir Herbert Croft, went to Bristol to gather materials for a\r\nbiography.  He talked with Barrett and Catcott, and with many of the\r\npoet's schoolmates and fellow-townsmen, and visited his mother and\r\nsister, who told him anecdotes of the marvelous boy's childhood and gave\r\nhim some of his letters.  Croft also traced Chatterton's footsteps in\r\nLondon, where he interviewed, among others, the coroner who had presided\r\nat the inquest over the suicide's body.  The result of these inquiries he\r\ngave to the world in a book entitled \"Love and Madness\" (1780).[26]\r\nSouthey thought that Croft had treated Mrs. Chatterton shabbily, in\r\nmaking her no pecuniary return from the profits of his book; and\r\narraigned him publicly for this in the edition of Chatterton's works\r\nwhich he and Joseph Cottle--both native Bristowans--published in three\r\nvolumes in 1803.  This was at first designed to be a subscription edition\r\nfor the benefit of Chatterton's mother and sister, but, the subscriptions\r\nnot being numerous enough, it was issued in the usual way, through \"the\r\ntrade.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in 1795, just a quarter of a century after Chatterton's death,\r\nthat Southey and Coleridge were married in St. Mary Redcliffe's Church to\r\nthe Misses Edith and Sara Fricker.  Coleridge was greatly interested in\r\nChatterton.  In his \"Lines on Observing a Blossom on the First of\r\nFebruary, 1796,\" he compares the flower to\r\n\r\n    \"Bristowa's bard, the wondrous boy,\r\n    An amaranth which earth seemed scarce to own,\r\n    Blooming 'mid poverty's drear wintry waste.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a little earlier than this, when meditating his pantisocracy scheme\r\nwith Southey and Lovell, he had addressed the dead poet in his indignant\r\n\"Monody on the Death of Chatterton,\" associating him in imagination with\r\nthe abortive community on the Susquehannah:\r\n\r\n    \"O Chatterton, that thou wert yet alive!\r\n    Sure thou would'st spread thy canvas to the gale,\r\n    And love with us the tinkling team to drive\r\n    O'er peaceful freedom's undivided dale;\r\n    And we at sober eve would round thee throng,\r\n    Hanging enraptured on thy stately song,\r\n    And greet with smiles the young-eyed poesy\r\n    All deftly masked as hoar antiquity. . .\r\n    Yet will I love to follow the sweet dream\r\n    Where Susquehannah pours his untamed stream;\r\n    And on some hill, whose forest-frowning side\r\n    Waves o'er the murmurs of his calmer tide,\r\n    Will raise a solemn cenotaph to thee,\r\n    Sweet harper of time-shrouded ministrelsy.\"\r\n\r\nIt might be hard to prove that the Rowley poems had very much to do with\r\ngiving shape to Coleridge's own poetic output.  Doubtless, without them,\r\n\"Christabel,\" and \"The Ancient Mariner,\" and \"The Darke Ladye\" would\r\nstill have been; and yet it is possible that they might not have been\r\njust what they are.  In \"The Ancient Mariner\" there is the ballad strain\r\nof the \"Reliques,\" but _plus_ something of Chatterton's.  In such lines\r\nas these:\r\n\r\n    \"The bride hath paced into the hall\r\n      Red as a rose is she:\r\n    Nodding their heads before her, goes\r\n      The merry minstrelsy;\"\r\n\r\nor as these:\r\n\r\n    \"The wedding guest here beat his breast\r\n      For he heard the loud bassoon:\"\r\n\r\none catches a far-away reverberation from certain stanzas of \"The\r\nBristowe Tragedie:\" this, _e.g._,\r\n\r\n    \"Before him went the council-men\r\n      In scarlet robes and gold,\r\n    And tassels spangling in the sun,\r\n      Much glorious to behold;\"\r\n\r\nand this:\r\n\r\n    \"In different parts a godly psalm\r\n      Most sweetly they did chant:\r\n    Behind their backs six minstrels came,\r\n      Who tuned the strung bataunt.\"[27]\r\n\r\nAmong all the young poets of the generation that succeeded Chatterton,\r\nthere was a tender feeling of comradeship with the proud and passionate\r\nboy, and a longing to admit him of their crew.  Byron, indeed, said that\r\nhe was insane; but Shelley, in \"Adonais,\" classes him with Keats among\r\n\"the inheritors of unfulfilled renown.\"  Lord Houghton testifies that\r\nKeats had a prescient sympathy with Chatterton in his early death.  He\r\ndedicated \"Endymion\" to his memory.  In his epistle \"To George Felton\r\nMathew,\" he asks him to help him find a place\r\n\r\n    \"Where we may soft humanity put on,\r\n    And sit, and rhyme, and think on Chatterton.\"[28]\r\n\r\nKeats said that he always associated the season of autumn with the memory\r\nof Chatterton.  He asserted, somewhat oddly, that he was the purest\r\nwriter in the English language and used \"no French idiom or particles,\r\nlike Chaucer.\"  In a letter from Jane Porter to Keats about the reviews\r\nof his \"Endymion,\" she wrote: \"Had Chatterton possessed sufficient\r\nmanliness of mind to know the magnanimity of patience, and been aware\r\nthat great talents have a commission from Heaven, he would not have\r\ndeserted his post, and his name might have been paged with Milton.\"\r\n\r\nKeats was the poetic child of Spenser, but some traits of manner--hard to\r\ndefine, though not to feel--he inherited from Chatterton.  In his\r\nunfinished poem, \"The Eve of St. Mark,\" there is a Rowleian accent in the\r\npassage imitative of early English, and in the loving description of the\r\nold volume of saints' legends whence it is taken, with its\r\n\r\n                \"--pious poesies\r\n    Written in smallest crow-quill size\r\n    Beneath the text.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we cannot but think of the shadow of St. Mary Redcliffe falling\r\nacross another young life, as we read how\r\n\r\n    \"Bertha was a maiden fair\r\n    Dwelling in th' old Minster-square;\r\n    From her fireside she could see,\r\n    Sidelong, its rich antiquity,\r\n    Far as the Bishop's garden-wall\";\r\n\r\nand of the footfalls that pass the echoing minster-gate, and of the\r\nclamorous daws that fall asleep in the ancient belfry to the sound of the\r\ndrowsy chimes.  Rossetti, in so many ways a continuator of Keats'\r\nartistry, devoted to Chatterton the first of his sonnet-group, \"Five\r\nEnglish Poets,\"[29] of which the sestet runs thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Thy nested home-loves, noble Chatterton;\r\n      The angel-trodden stair thy soul could trace\r\n      Up Redcliffe's spire; and in the world's armed space\r\n    Thy gallant sword-play:--these to many an one\r\n    Are sweet for ever; as thy grave unknown\r\n      And love-dream of thine unrecorded face.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of Chatterton's life found its way into fiction and upon the\r\nstage.  Afred de Vigny, one of the French romanticists, translator of\r\n\"Othello\" and \"The Merchant of Venice,\" introduced it as an episode into\r\nhis romance, \"Stello ou les Diables Bleus,\" afterward dramatized as\r\n\"Chatterton,\" and first played at Paris on February 12, 1835, with great\r\nsuccess.  De Vigny made a love tragedy out of it, inventing a sweetheart\r\nfor his hero, in the person of Kitty Bell, a role which became one of\r\nMadame Dorval's chief triumphs.  On the occasion of the revival of De\r\nVigny's drama in December, 1857, Théophile Gautier gave, in the\r\n_Moniteur_,[30] some reminiscences of its first performance, twenty-two\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\n\"The parterre before which Chatterton declaimed was full of pale,\r\nlong-haired youths, who firmly believed that there was no other worthy\r\noccupation on earth but the making of verses or of pictures--art, as they\r\ncalled it; and who looked upon the bourgeois with a disdain to which the\r\ndisdain of the Heidelberg or Jena 'fox' for the 'philistine' hardly\r\napproaches. . .  As to money, no one thought of it.  More than one, as in\r\nthat assembly of impossible professions which Theodore de Banville\r\ndescribes with so resigned an irony, could have cried without falsehood\r\n'I am a lyric poet and I live by my profession.'  One who has not passed\r\nthrough that mad, ardent, over-excited but generous epoch, cannot imagine\r\nto what a forgetfulness of material existence the intoxication, or, if\r\nyou prefer, infatuation of art pushed the obscure and fragile victims who\r\nwould rather have died than renounce their dream.  One actually heard in\r\nthe night the crack of solitary pistols.  Judge of the effect produced in\r\nsuch an environment by M. Afred Vigney's 'Chatterton'; to which, if you\r\nwould comprehend it, you must restore the contemporary atmosphere.\"[31]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wordsworth, \"Resolution and Independence.\"\r\n\r\n[2] January 1, 1753.\r\n\r\n[3] \"The Poetical Works of Thos.

But\r\nnow the English literary current began to receive a tributary stream from\r\nabroad.  A change had taken place in the attitude of the German mind\r\nwhich corresponds quite closely to that whose successive steps we have\r\nbeen following.  In Germany, French classicism had got an even firmer\r\nhold than in England.  It is well-known that Frederick the Great\r\n(1740-86) regarded his mother-tongue as a barbarous dialect, hardly fit\r\nfor literary use.  In his own writings, prose and verse, he invariably\r\nemployed French; and he boasted to Gottsched that from his youth up he\r\nhad not read a German book.[1]\r\n\r\nBut already before the middle of the century, and just about the time of\r\nthe publication of Thomason's \"Seasons,\" the so-called Swiss school,\r\nunder the leadership of the Züricher, Johann Jacob Bodmer, had begun a\r\nnational movement and an attack upon Gallic influences.  Bodmer fought\r\nunder Milton's banner, and in the preface to his prose translation of\r\n\"Paradise Lost\" (1732), he praised Shakspere as the English Sophocles.\r\nIn his \"Abhandlung von dem Wunderbaren\" (\"Treatise on the Marvelous,\"\r\n1740) he asserted the claims of freedom, nature, and the inspired\r\nimagination against the rules of French critics, very much as the Wartons\r\nand Bishop Hurd did a few years later in England.  _Deutscheit,\r\nVolkspoesie_, the German past, the old Teutonic hero-age, with the\r\n_Kaiserzeit_ and the Middle Ages in general, soon came into fashion.  \"As\r\nearly as 1748 Bodmer had published specimens from the Minnesingers, in\r\n1757 he had brought out a part of the Nibelungenlied, in 1758 and 1759 a\r\nmore complete collection of the Minnesingers, and till 1781, till just\r\nbefore his death, he continued to produce editions of the Middle\r\nHigh-German poems.  Another Swiss writer, Christian Heinrich Myller, a\r\npupil of Bodmer's . . . published in 1784 and 1785 the whole of the\r\nNibelungenlied and the most important of the chivalrous epics.  Lessing,\r\nin his preface to Gleim's 'War-songs,' called attention to the Middle\r\nHigh German poets, of whom he continued to be throughout his life an\r\nardent admirer.  Justus Möser took great interest in the Minnesingers.\r\nAbout the time when 'Götz' appeared, this enthusiasm for early German\r\npoetry was at its strongest, and Bürger, Voss, Miller, and Höltz wrote\r\nMinnesongs, in which they imitated the old German lyric poets.  In 1773\r\nGleim published 'Poems after the Minnesingers,' and in 1779 'Poems after\r\nWalther von der Vogelweide.'  Some enthusiasts had already hailed the\r\nNibelungenlied as the German Iliad, and Bürger, who vied hard with the\r\nrest, but without much success, in turning Homer into German, insisted on\r\ndressing up the Greek heroes a little in the Nibelungen style.  He and a\r\nfew other poets loved to give their ballads a chivalrous character.\r\nFritz Stolberg wrote the beautiful song of a German boy, beginning, 'Mein\r\nArm wird stark und gross mein Muth, gib, Vater, mir ein Schwert'; and the\r\nsong of the old Swabian knight--'Sohn, da hast du meinen Speer; meinem\r\nArm wird er zu schwer.'  Lessing's 'Nathan,' too, appealed to this\r\nenthusiasm for the times of chivalry, and must have strengthened the\r\nfeeling.  An historian like the Swiss, Johannes Müller, began to show the\r\nMiddle Ages in a fairer light, and even to ascribe great merits to the\r\nPapacy.  But in doing so, Johannes Müller was only following in Herder's\r\nsteps.  Herder . . . had written against the self-conceit of his age, its\r\npride in its enlightenment and achievements.  He found in the Middle Ages\r\nthe realization of his aesthetic ideas, namely, strong emotion, stirring\r\nlife and action, everything guided by feeling and instinct, not by morbid\r\nthought: religious ardor and chivalrous honor, boldness in love and\r\nstrong patriotic feeling.\"[2]\r\n\r\nWhen the founders of a truly national literature in Germany cut loose\r\nfrom French moorings, they had an English pilot aboard; and in the\r\ntranslations from German romances, dramas, and ballads that were made by\r\nScott, Coleridge, Taylor, Lewis, and others, English literature was\r\nmerely taking back with usury what it had lent its younger sister.\r\nMention has already been made of Bürger's and Herder's renderings from\r\nPercy's \"Reliques,\"[3] an edition of which was published at Göttingen in\r\n1767; as well as of the strong excitement aroused in Germany by\r\nMacPherson's \"Ossian.\"[4]  This last found--besides the Viennese\r\nDenis--another translator in Fritz Stolberg, who carried his medievalism\r\nso far as to join the Roman Catholic Church in 1800.  Klopstock's\r\n\"Kriegslied,\" written as early as 1749, was in the meter of \"Chevy\r\nChase,\" which Klopstock knew through Addison's _Spectator_ papers.\r\nThrough Mallet, the Eddaic literature made an impression in Germany as in\r\nEngland; and Gerstenberg's \"Gedicht eines Skalden\" (1766), one of the\r\nfirst-fruits of the German translation of the \"Historire de Dannemarc,\"\r\npreceded by two years the publication--though not the composition--of\r\nGray's poems from the Norse.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit which wrought most mightily upon the new German literature\r\nwas Shakspere's.  During the period of French culture there had been\r\npractically no knowledge of Shakspere in Germany.  In 1741 Christian von\r\nBorck, Prussian ambassador to London, had translated \"Julius Caesar.\"\r\nThis was followed, a few years later, by a version of \"Romeo and Juliet.\"\r\nIn 1762-66 Wieland translated, in whole or in part, twenty-two\r\nShakspere's plays.  His translation was in prose and has been long\r\nsuperseded by the Tieck-Schlegel translation (1797-1801-1810).  Goethe\r\nfirst made acquaintance with Shakspere, when a student at Leipsic,\r\nthrough the detached passages given in \"Dodd's Beauties of Shakspere.\"[5]\r\nHe afterward got hold of Wieland's translation, and when he went to\r\nStrassburg he fell under the influence of Herder, who inspired him with\r\nhis own enthusiasm for \"Ossian,\" and the _Volkslieder_, and led him to\r\nstudy Shakspere in the original.\r\n\r\nYoung Germany fastened upon and appropriated the great English dramatist\r\nwith passionate conviction.  He became an object of worship, an article\r\nof faith.  The Shakspere _cultus_ dominated the whole _Sturm- und\r\nDrangperoide_.  The stage domesticated him: the poets imitated him: the\r\ncritics exalted him into the type and representative (_Urbild_) of\r\nGermanic art, as opposed to and distinguished from the art of the Latin\r\nraces, founded upon a false reproduction of the antique.[6]  It was a\r\nrecognition of the essential kinships between the two separated branches\r\nof the great Teutonic stock.  The enthusiastic young patriots of the\r\nGöttinger _Hain_,--who hated everything French and called each other by\r\nthe names of ancient bards,--accustomed themselves to the use of\r\nShaksperian phrases in conversation; and on one occasion celebrated the\r\ndramatist's birthday so uproariously that they were pounced upon by the\r\npolice and spent the night in the lockup.  In Goethe's circle at\r\nStrassburg, which numbered, among others, Lenz, Klinger, and H. L.\r\nWagner, this Shakspere mania was _de rigueur_.  Lenz, particularly, who\r\ntranslated \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" excelled in whimsical imitations of\r\n\"such conceits as clownage keeps in pay.\"[7]  Upon his return to\r\nFrankfort, Goethe gave a feast in Shakspere's honor at his father's house\r\n(October 14, 1771), in which healths were drunk to the \"Will of all\r\nWills,\" and the youthful host delivered an extravagant eulogy.  \"The\r\nfirst page of Shakspere's that I read,\" runs a sentence of this oration,\r\n\"made me his own for life, and when I was through with the first play, I\r\nstood like a man born blind, to whom sight has been given by an instant's\r\nmiracle.  I had a most living perception of the fact that my being had\r\nbeen expanded a whole infinitude.  Everything was new and strange; my\r\neyes ached with the unwonted light.\"[8]\r\n\r\nLessing, in his onslaught upon the French theater in his \"Hamburgische\r\nDramaturgie\" (1767-69), maintained that there was a much closer agreement\r\nbetween Sophocles and Shakspere in the essentials of dramatic art than\r\nbetween Sophocles and Racine or Voltaire in their mechanical copies of\r\nthe antique.  In their own plays, Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller all took\r\nShakspere as their model.  But while beginning with imitation, they came\r\nin time to work freely in the spirit of Shakspere rather than in his\r\nmanner.  Thus the first draught of Goethe's \"Götz von Berlichingen\"\r\nconforms in all externals to the pattern of a Shaksperian \"history.\"  The\r\nunity of action went overboard along with those of time and place; the\r\nscene was shifted for a monologue of three lines or a dialogue of six;\r\ntragic and comic were interwoven; the stage was thronged with a motley\r\nvariety of figures, humors, and conditions--knights, citizens, soldiers,\r\nhorse-boys, peasants; there was a court-jester; songs and lyric passages\r\nwere interspersed; there were puns, broad jokes, rant, Elizabethan\r\nmetaphors, and swollen trunk-hose hyperboles, with innumerable\r\nShakesperian reminiscences in detail.  But the advice of Herder, to whom\r\nhe sent his manuscript, and the example of Lessing, whose \"Emilia\r\nGalotti\" had just appeared, persuaded Goethe to recast the piece and give\r\nit a more independent form.\r\n\r\nScherer[9] says that the pronunciamento of the new national movement in\r\nGerman letters was the \"small, badly printed anonymous book\" entitled\r\n\"Von Deutscher Art und Kunst, einige fliegende Blätter\" (\"Some Loose\r\nLeaves about German Style and Art\"), which appeared in 1773 and contained\r\nessays by Justus Möser, who \"upheld the liberty of the ancient Germans as\r\na vanished ideal\"; by Johann Gottfried Herder, who \"celebrated the merits\r\nof popular song, advocated a collection of the German _Volkslieder_,\r\nextolled the greatness of Shakspere, and prophesied the advent of a\r\nGerman Shakspere\"; and Johann Wolfgang Goethe, who praised the Strassburg\r\nMinster and Gothic architecture[10] in general, and \"asserted that art,\r\nto be true, must be characteristic.  The reform, or revolution, which\r\nthis little volume announced was connected with hostility to France, and\r\nwith a friendly attitude toward England. . .  This great movement was, in\r\nfact, a revulsion from the spirit of Voltaire to that of Rousseau, from\r\nthe artificiality of society to the simplicity of nature, from doubt and\r\nrationalism to feeling and faith, from _a priori_ notions[11] to history,\r\nfrom hard and fast aesthetic rules to the freedom of genius.  Goethe's\r\n'Götz' was the first revolutionary symptom which really attracted much\r\nattention, but the 'Fly-sheets on German Style and Art' preceded the\r\npublication of 'Götz,' as a kind of programme or manifesto.\"  Even\r\nWieland, the mocking and French-minded, the man of consummate\r\ntalent but shallow genius, the representative of the _Aufklärung_\r\n(_Éclaircissement_, Illumination) was carried away by this new stream of\r\ntendency, and saddled his hoppogriff for a ride _ins alte romantische\r\nLand_.  He availed himself of the new \"Library of Romance\" which Count\r\nTressan began publishing in France in 1775, studied Hans Sachs and\r\nHartmann von Aue, experiments with Old German meters, and enriched his\r\nvocabulary from Old German sources.  He poetized popular fairy tales,\r\nchivalry stories, and motives from the Arthurian epos, such as \"Gandalin\"\r\nand \"Geron der Adeliche\" (\"Gyron le Courteois\").  But his best and\r\nbest-known work in this temper was \"Oberon\" (1780) a rich composite of\r\nmaterials from Chaucer, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" and the French\r\nromance of \"Huon of Bordeaux.\"[12]\r\n\r\nFrom this outline--necessarily very imperfect and largely at second\r\nhand--of the course of the German romantic movement in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, it will nevertheless appear that it ran parallel to the English\r\nmost of the way.  In both countries the reaction was against the\r\n_Aufklärung_, _i.e._, against the rationalistic, prosaic, skeptical,\r\ncommon-sense spirit of the age, represented in England by deistical\r\nwriters like Shaftesbury, Mandeville, Bolingbroke, and Tindal in the\r\ndepartment of religious and moral philosophy; and by writers like\r\nAddison, Swift, Prior, and Pope in polite letters; and represented most\r\nbrilliantly in the literatures of Europe by Voltaire.  In opposition to\r\nthis spirit, an effort was now made to hark back to the ages of faith; to\r\nrecover the point of view which created mythology, fairy lore, and\r\npopular superstitions; to _believe_, at all hazards, not only in God and\r\nthe immortal soul of man, but in the old-time corollaries of these\r\nbeliefs, in ghosts, elves, demons, and witches.\r\n\r\nIn both countries, too, the revolution, as it concerned form, was a break\r\nwith French classicism and with that part of the native literature which\r\nhad followed academic traditions.  Here the insurrection was far more\r\nviolent in Germany than in England,[13] partly because Gallic influence\r\nhad tyrannized there more completely and almost to the supplanting of the\r\nvernacular by the foreign idiom, for literary uses; and partly because\r\nGermany had nothing to compare with the shining and solid achievements of\r\nthe Queen Anne classics in England.  It was easy for the new school of\r\nGerman poets and critics to brush aside _perruques_ like Opitz,\r\nGottsched, and Gellert--authors of the fourth and fifth class.  But Swift\r\nand Congreve, and Pope and Fielding, were not thus to be disposed of.  We\r\nhave noted the cautious, respectful manner in which such innovators as\r\nWarton and Percy ventured to question Pope's supremacy and to recommend\r\nolder English poets to the attention of a polite age; and we have seen\r\nthat Horace Walpole's Gothic enthusiasms were not inconsistent with\r\nliterary prejudices more conservation than radical, upon the whole.  In\r\nEngland, again, the movement began with imitations of Spenser and Milton,\r\nand, gradually only, arrived at the resuscitation of Chaucer and medieval\r\npoetry and the translation of Bardic and Scaldic remains.  But in Germany\r\nthere was no Elizabethan literature to mediate between the modern mind\r\nand the Middle Age, and so the Germans resorted to England and Shakspere\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, as in England, though for different reasons, the romantic\r\nrevival did not culminate until the nineteenth century, until the\r\nappearance of the _Romantische Schule_ in the stricter sense--of Tieck,\r\nNovalis, the Schlegel brothers, Wackenroder, Fouqué, Von Arnim, Brentano,\r\nand Uhland.  In England this was owing less to arrested development than\r\nto the absence of genius. There the forerunners of Scott, Coleridge, and\r\nKeats were writers of a distinctly inferior order: Akenside, Shenstone,\r\nDyer, the Wartons, Percy, Walpole, Mrs. Radcliffe, \"Monk\" Lewis, the boy\r\nChatterton.  If a few rise above this level, like Thomason, Collins, and\r\nGray, the slenderness of their performance, and the somewhat casual\r\nnature of their participation in the movement, diminish their relative\r\nimportance.  Gray's purely romantic work belongs to the last years of his\r\nlife.  Collins' derangement and early death stopped the unfolding of many\r\nbuds of promise in this rarely endowed lyrist.  Thomson, perhaps, came\r\ntoo early to reach any more advanced stage of evolution than Spenserism.\r\nIn Germany, on the contrary, the pioneers were men of the highest\r\nintellectual stature, Lessing, Herder, Goethe, Schiller.  But there the\r\nmovement was checked for a time by counter-currents, or lost in broader\r\ntides of literary life.  English romanticism was but one among many\r\ncontemporary tendencies: sentimentalism, naturalism, realism.  German\r\nromanticism was simply an incident of the _sturm- und Drangperiode_,\r\nwhich was itself but a temporary phase of the swift and many-sided\r\nunfolding of the German mind in the latter half of the last century; one\r\nelement in the great intellectual ferment which threw off, among other\r\nproducts, the Kantian philosophy, the \"Laocoön,\" \"Faust,\" and \"Wilhelm\r\nMeister\"; Winckelmann's \"Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums\" and\r\nSchiller's \"Wallenstein\" and \"Wilhelm Tell.\"  Men like Goethe and\r\nSchiller were too broad in their culture, too versatile in their talents,\r\ntoo multifarious in their mental activities and sympathies to be\r\nclassified with a school.  The temper which engendered \"Götz\" and \"Die\r\nRäuber\" was only a moment in the history of their _Entwickelung_; they\r\npassed on presently into other regions of thought and art.\r\n\r\nIn Goethe especially there ensued, after the time of his _Italienische\r\nReise_, a reversion to the classic; not the exploded pseudo-classic of\r\nthe eighteenth-century brand, but the true Hellenic spirit which\r\nexpressed itself in such work as \"Iphigenie auf Tauris,\" \"Hermann und\r\nDorothea,\" and the \"Schöne Helena\" and \"Classische Walpurgis-Nacht\"\r\nepisodes in the second part of \"Faust.\"  \"In his youth,\" says Scherer, \"a\r\nlove for the historical past of Germany had seized on the minds of many.\r\nImaginative writers filled the old Teutonic forests with Bards and Druids\r\nand cherished an enthusiastic admiration for Gothic cathedrals and for\r\nthe knights of the Middle Ages and of the sixteenth century. . .  In\r\nGoethe's mature years, on the contrary, the interest in classical\r\nantiquity dwarfed all other aesthetic interests, and Germany and Europe\r\nwere flooded by the classical fashion for which Winckelmann had given the\r\nfirst strong impulse.  The churches became ancient temples, the\r\nmechanical arts strove after classical forms, and ladies affected the\r\ndress and manners of Greek women. The leaders of German poetry, Goethe\r\nand Schiller, both attained the summit of their art in the imitation of\r\nclassical models.\"[14]  Still the ground recovered from the Middle Age\r\nwas never again entirely lost; and in spite of this classical\r\nprepossession, Goethe and Schiller, even in the last years of the\r\ncentury, vied with one another in the composition of romantic ballads,\r\nlike the former's \"Der Erlkonig,\" \"Der Fischer,\" \"Der Todtentanz,\" and\r\n\"Der Zauberlehrling,\" and the latter's \"Ritter Toggenburg,\" \"Der Kampf\r\nmit dem Drachen,\" and \"Der Gang nach dem Eisenhammer.\"\r\n\r\nOn comparing the works of a romantic temper produced in England and in\r\nGermany during the last century, one soon becomes aware that, though the\r\noriginal impulse was communicated from England, the continental movement\r\nhad greater momentum.  The _Gründlichkeit_, the depth and thoroughness of\r\nthe German mind, impels it to base itself in the fine arts, as in\r\npolitics and religion, on foundation principles; to construct for its\r\npractice a theoria, an _aesthetik_.  In the later history of German\r\nromanticism, the medieval revival in letters and art was carried out with\r\na philosophic consistency into other domains of thought and made\r\naccessory to reactionary statecraft and theology, to Junkerism and\r\nCatholicism.  Meanwhile, though the literary movement in Germany in the\r\neighteenth century did not quite come to a head, it was more critical,\r\nlearned, and conscious of its own purposes and methods than the kindred\r\nmovement in England.  The English mind, in the act of creation, works\r\npractically and instinctively.  It seldom seeks to bring questions of\r\ntaste or art under the domain of scientific laws.  During the classical\r\nperiod it had accepted its standards of taste from France, and when it\r\nbroke away from these, it did so upon impulse and gave either no reasons,\r\nor very superficial ones, for its new departure.  The elegant\r\ndissertations of Hurd and Percy, and the Wartons, seem very dilettantish\r\nwhen set beside the imposing systems of aesthetics propounded by Kant,\r\nFichte, and Schelling; or beside thorough-going _Abhandlungen_ like the\r\n\"Laocoön,\" the \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie,\" Schiller's treatise \"Ueber\r\nnaïve and sentimentalische Dichtung,\" or the analysis of Hamlet's\r\ncharacter in \"Wilhelm Meister.\"  There was no criticism of this kind in\r\nEngland before Coleridge; no Shakspere criticism, in particular, to\r\ncompare with the papers on that subject by Lessing, Herder, Gerstenberg,\r\nLenz, Goethe, and many other Germans.  The only eighteenth-century\r\nEnglishman who would have been capable of such was Gray.  He had the\r\nrequisite taste and scholarship, but even he wanted the philosophic\r\nbreadth and depth for a fundamental and _eingehend_ treatment of\r\nunderlying principles.\r\n\r\nYet even in this critical department, German literary historians credit\r\nEngland with the initiative.  Hettner[15] mentions three English critics,\r\nin particular, as predecessors of Herder in awakening interest in popular\r\npoetry.  These were Edward Young, the author of \"Night Thoughts,\" whose\r\n\"Conjectures on Original Composition\" was published in 1759: Robert Wood,\r\nwhose \"Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer\" (1768) was\r\ntranslated into German, French, Spanish, and Italian; and Robert Lowth,\r\nBishop of Oxford, who was Professor of Poetry at Oxford delivered there\r\nin 1753 his \"Praelectiones de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum,\" translated into\r\nEnglish and German in 1793.  The significance of Young's brilliant little\r\nessay, which was in form a letter addressed to the author of \"Sir Charles\r\nGrandison,\" lay in its assertion of the superiority of genius to learning\r\nand of the right of genius to be free from rules and authorities.  It was\r\na sort of literary declaration of independence; and it asked, in\r\nsubstance, the question asked in Emerson's \"Nature\": \"Why should not we\r\nalso enjoy an original relation to the universe?\"  Pope had said, in his\r\n\"Essay on Criticism,\"[16] \"follow Nature,\" and in order to follow Nature,\r\nlearn the rules and study the ancients, particularly Homer.  \"Nature and\r\nHomer were the same.\"  Contrariwise, Young says: \"The less we copy the\r\nrenowned ancients, we shall resemble them the more. . .\r\nLearning . . . is a great lover of rules and boaster of famed\r\nexamples . . . and sets rigid bounds to that liberty to which genius\r\noften owes its supreme glory. . .  Born _originals_, how comes it to pass\r\nthat we die _copies_?. . .  Let not great examples or authorities\r\nbrowbeat thy reason into too great a diffidence of thyself. . .  While\r\nthe true genius is crossing all public roads into fresh untrodden ground;\r\nhe [the imitative writer], up to the knees in antiquity, is treading the\r\nsacred footsteps of great examples with the blind veneration of a bigot\r\nsaluting the sacred toe.\"  Young asserts that Shakspere is equal in\r\ngreatness to the ancients: regrets that Pope did not employ blank verse\r\nin his translation of Homer, and calls Addison's \"Cato\" \"a piece of\r\nstatuary.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Wood, who visited and described the ruins of Balbec and Palmrya,\r\ntook his Iliad to the Troad and read it on the spot.  He sailed in the\r\ntrack of Menelaus and the wandering Ulysses; and his acquaintance with\r\nEastern scenery and life helped to substitute a fresher apprehension of\r\nHomer for the somewhat conventional conception that had prevailed through\r\nthe classical period.  What most forcibly struck Herder and Goethe in\r\nWood's essay was the emphasis laid upon the simple, unlettered, and even\r\nbarbaric state of society in the heroic age: and upon the primitive and\r\npopular character (_Ursprünglichkeit, Volksthümlichkeit_) of the Homeric\r\npoems.[17]  This view of Homer, as essentially a minstrel or\r\nballad-maker, has been carried so far in Professor Newman's translations\r\nas to provoke remonstrance from Matthew Arnold, who insists upon Homer's\r\n\"nobility\" and \"grand style.\"[18]  But with whatever exaggeration it may\r\nhave latterly been held, it was wholesomely corrective and stimulating\r\nwhen propounded in 1768.\r\n\r\nThough the final arrival of German romanticism, in its fullness, was\r\npostponed too late to modify the English movement, before the latter had\r\nspent its first strength, yet the prelude was heard in England and found\r\nan echo there.  In 1792 Walter Scott was a young lawyer at Edinburgh and\r\nhad just attained his majority.\r\n\r\n    \"Romance who loves to nod and sing\r\n    With drowsy head and folded wing,\r\n    To _him_ a painted paroquet\r\n    Had been--a most familiar bird--\r\n    Taught _him_ his alphabet to say,\r\n    To lisp his very earliest word.\"[19]\r\n\r\nHe had lain from infancy \"in the lap of legends old,\" and was already\r\nlearned in the antiquities of the Border.  For years he had been making\r\nhis collection of _memorabilia_; claymores, suits of mail, Jedburgh axes,\r\nborder horns, etc.  He had begun his annual raids into Liddesdale, in\r\nsearch of ballads and folk lore, and was filling notebooks with passages\r\nfrom the Edda, records of old Scotch law-cases, copies of early English\r\npoems, notes on the \"Morte Darthur,\" on the second sight, on fairies and\r\nwitches; extracts from Scottish chronicles, from the Books of Adjournal,\r\nfrom Aubrey, and old Glanvil of superstitious memory; tables of the\r\nMoeso-Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, and Runic alphabets and transcripts relating\r\nto the history of the Stuarts.  In the autumn or early winter of that\r\nyear, a class of six or seven young men was formed at Edinburgh for the\r\nstudy of German, and Scott joined it.  In his own account of the matter\r\nhe says that interest in German literature was first aroused in Scotland\r\nby a paper read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in April, 1788, by\r\nHenry Mackenzie, the \"Addison of the North,\" and author of that most\r\nsentimental fictions, \"The Man of Feeling.\"  \"The literary persons of\r\nEdinburgh were then first made aware of the existence of works of genius\r\nin a language cognate with the English, and possessed of the same manly\r\nforce of expressions; they learned at the same time that the taste which\r\ndictated the German compositions was of a kind as nearly allied to the\r\nEnglish as their language; those who were from their youth accustomed to\r\nadmire Shakspere and Milton became acquainted for the first time with a\r\nrace of poets who had the same lofty ambition to spurn the flaming\r\nboundaries of the universe and investigate the realms of Chaos and old\r\nNight; and of dramatists who, disclaiming the pedantry of the unities,\r\nsought, at the expense of occasional improbabilities and extravagance, to\r\npresent life on the stage in its scenes of wildest contrast, and in all\r\nits boundless variety of character. . .  Their fictitious narratives,\r\ntheir ballad poetry, and other branches of their literature which are\r\nparticularly apt to bear the stamp of the extravagant and the\r\nsupernatural, began also to occupy the attention of the British\r\nliterati.\"  Scott's German studies were much assisted by Alexander Frazer\r\nTytler, whose version of Schiller's \"Robbers\" was one of the earliest\r\nEnglish translations from the German theater.[20]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1794 Miss Aikin, afterward Mrs. Barbauld, entertained a\r\nparty at Dugald Stewart's by reading a translation of Bürger's ghastly\r\nballad \"Lenore.\"  The translation was by William Taylor of Norwich; it\r\nhad not yet been published, and Miss Aikin read it from a manuscript\r\ncopy.  Scott was not present, but his friend Mr. Cranstoun described the\r\nperformance to him; and he was so much impressed by his description that\r\nhe borrowed a volume of Burger's poems from his young kinswoman by\r\nmarriage, Mrs. Scott of Harden, a daughter of Count Brühl of Martkirchen,\r\nformerly Saxon ambassador at London, who had a Scotchwoman for his second\r\nwife, the dowager Countess of Egremont.  Scott set to work in 1795 to\r\nmake a translation of the ballad for himself, and succeeded so well in\r\npleasing his friends that he had a few copies struck off for private\r\ncirculation in the spring of 1796.  In the autumn of the same year he\r\npublished his version under the title \"William and Helen,\" together with\r\n\"The Chase,\" a translation of Bürger's \"Der Wilde Jäger.\"  The two poems\r\nmade a thin quarto volume.  It was printed at Edinburgh, was anonymous,\r\nand was Walter Scott's first published book.  Meanwhile Taylor had given\r\nhis rendering to the public in the March number of the _Monthly\r\nMagazine_, introducing it with a notice of Burger's poems; and the very\r\nsame year witnessed the appearance of three other translations, one by J.\r\nT. Stanley (with copperplate engravings), one by Henry James Pye, the\r\npoet laureate, and one by the Hon. William Robert Spencer,--author of\r\n\"Beth Gelert.\"  \"Too Late I Stayed,\" etc.,--with designs by Lady Diana\r\nBeauclerc.  (A copy of this last, says Allibone, in folio, on vellum,\r\nsold at Christie's in 1804 for L25 4s.)  A sixth translation, by the Rev.\r\nJames Beresford, who had lived some time in Berlin, came out about 1800;\r\nand Schlegel and Brandl unite in pronouncing this the most faithful, if\r\nnot the best, English version of the ballad.[21]\r\n\r\nThe poem of which England had taken such manifold possession, under the\r\nvaried titles \"Lenore,\" \"Leonore,\" \"Leonora,\" \"Lenora,\" \"Ellenore,\"\r\n\"Helen,\" etc., was indeed a noteworthy one.  In the original, it remains\r\nBürger's masterpiece, and in its various English dresses it gained\r\nperhaps as many graces as it lost.  It was first printed at Göttingen in\r\nBoie's \"Musen Almanach\" in 1773.  It was an uncanny tale of a soldier of\r\nFrederick the Great, who had perished in the Seven Years' War, and who\r\ncame at midnight on a spectral steed to claim his ladylove and carry her\r\noff a thousand miles to the bridal bed.  She mounts behind him and they\r\nride through the phantasms of the night till, at cock-crow, they come to\r\na churchyard.  The charger vanishes in smoke, the lover's armor drops\r\nfrom him, green with the damps of the grave, revealing a skeleton within,\r\nand the maiden finds that her nuptial chamber is the charnel vault, and\r\nher bridegroom is Death.  \"This poem,\" says Scherer, \"leaves on us, to\r\nsome degree, the impression of an unsolved mystery; all the details are\r\nclear, but at the end we have to ask ourselves what has really happened;\r\nwas it a dream of the girl, a dream in which she died, or did the ghost\r\nreally appear and carry her away?\"[22]  The story is managed, indeed,\r\nwith much of that subtle art which Coleridge used in \"The Ancient\r\nMariner\" and \"Christabel\"; so that the boundary between the earthly and\r\nthe unearthly becomes indefinite, and the doubt continually occurs\r\nwhether we are listening to a veritable ghost-story, or to some finer\r\nform of allegory.  \"Lenore\" drew for its materials upon ballad motives\r\ncommon to many literatures.  It will be sufficient to mention \"Sweet\r\nWilliam's Ghost,\" as an English example of the class.\r\n\r\nScott's friends assured him that his translation was superior to\r\nTaylor's, and Taylor himself wrote to him: \"The ghost nowhere makes his\r\nappearance so well as with you, or his exit so well as with Mr. Spencer.\"\r\nBut Lewis was right in preferring Taylor's version, which has a wildness\r\nand quaintness not found in Scott's more literal and more polished\r\nrendering, and is wonderfully successful in catching the _Grobheit_, the\r\nrude, rough manner of popular poetry.  A few stanzas from each will\r\nillustrate the difference:\r\n\r\n    [From Scott's \"William and Helen.\"]\r\n\r\n    \"Dost fear? dost fear? The moon shines clear:--\r\n      Dost fear to ride with me?\r\n    Hurrah! Hurrah! the dead can ride\"--\r\n      \"O William, let them be!\"\r\n\r\n    \"See there! see there!  What yonder swings\r\n       And creaks 'mid whistling rain?\"\r\n    \"Gibbet and steel, the accursed wheel;\r\n       A murd'rer in his chain.\r\n\r\n    \"Halloa!  Thou felon, follow here:\r\n      To bridal bed we ride;\r\n    And thou shalt prance a fetter dance\r\n      Before me and my bride.\"\r\n\r\n    And hurry! hurry! clash, clash, clash!\r\n      The wasted form descends,[23]\r\n    And fleet as wind through hazel bush\r\n      The wild career attends.[23]\r\n\r\n    Tramp, tramp! along the land they rode,\r\n      Splash, splash! along the sea:\r\n    The scourge is red, the spur drops blood,\r\n      The flashing pebbles flee.\r\n\r\n    [From Taylor's \"Lenora.\"]\r\n\r\n    Look up, look up, an airy crewe\r\n      In roundel dances reele.\r\n    The moone is bryghte and blue the night,\r\n      May'st dimly see them wheel.[24]\r\n\r\n    \"Come to, come to, ye ghostlie crewe,\r\n      Come to and follow me.\r\n    And daunce for us the wedding daunce\r\n      When we in bed shall be.\"\r\n\r\n    And brush, brush, brush, the ghostlie crew\r\n      Come wheeling o'er their heads,\r\n    All rustling like the withered leaves\r\n      That wyde the whirlwind spreads.\r\n\r\n    Halloo! halloo! Away they goe\r\n      Unheeding wet or drye,\r\n    And horse and rider snort and blowe,\r\n      And sparkling pebbles flye.\r\n\r\n    And all that in the moonshine lay\r\n      Behynde them fled afar;\r\n    And backward scudded overhead\r\n      The skye and every star.\r\n\r\n    Tramp, tramp across the land they speede,\r\n      Splash, splash across the sea:\r\n    \"Hurrah! the dead can ride apace,\r\n      Dost fear to ride with me?\"\r\n\r\nIt was this stanza which fascinated Scott, as repeated from memory by Mr.\r\nCranstoun; and he retained it without much change in his version.  There\r\nis no mention of the sea in Bürger, whose hero is killed in the battle of\r\nPrague and travels only by land.  But Taylor nationalized and\r\nindividualized the theme by making his William a knight of Richard the\r\nLion Heart's, who had fallen in Holy Land.  Scott followed him and made\r\nhis a crusader in the army of Frederic Barbarossa.  Bürger's poem was\r\nwritten in an eight-lined stanza, but Taylor and Scott both chose the\r\ncommon English ballad verse, with its folkloreish associations, as the\r\nbest vehicle for reproducing the grewsome substance of the story; and\r\nTaylor gave an archaic cast to his diction, still further to heighten the\r\neffect.  Lewis considered his version a masterpiece of translation, and,\r\nindeed, \"far superior, both in spirit and in harmony, to the German.\"\r\nTaylor showed almost equal skill in his rendering of Bürger's next most\r\npopular ballad, \"Des Pfarrer's Tochter von Taubenhain,\" first printed in\r\nthe _Monthly Magazine_ for April, 1796, under the somewhat odd title of\r\n\"The Lass of Fair Wone.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor of Norwich did more than any man of his generation, by his\r\ntranslations and critical papers in the _Monthly Magazine_ and _Monthly\r\nReview_, to spread a knowledge of the new German literature in England.\r\nWhen a lad of sixteen he had been sent to study at Detmold, Westphalia,\r\nand had spent more than a year (1781-82) in Germany, calling upon Goethe\r\nat Weimar, with a letter of introduction, on his way home to England.\r\n\"When his acquaintance with this literature began,\" wrote Lucy Aikin,\r\n\"there was probably no English translation of any German author but\r\nthrough the medium of the French, and he is very likely to have been the\r\nfirst Englishman of letters to read Goethe, Wieland, Lessing, and Bürger\r\nin the originals.\"[25]  Some years before the publication of his \"Lenora\"\r\nhe had printed for private distribution translations of Lessing's \"Nathan\r\nder Weise\" (1791) and Goethe's \"Iphigenie auf Tauris\" (1793).  In 1829-30\r\nhe gathered up his numerous contributions to periodicals and put them\r\ntogether in a three-volume \"Historic Survey of German Poetry,\" which was\r\nrather roughly, though not disrespectfully, handled by Carlyle in the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_.  Taylor's tastes were one-sided, not to say\r\neccentric; he had not kept up with the later movement of German thought;\r\nhis critical opinions were out of date, and his book was sadly wanting in\r\nunity and a proper perspective.  Carlyle was especially scandalized by\r\nthe slight space accorded to Goethe.[26]  But Taylor's really brilliant\r\ntalent in translation, and his important service as an introducer and\r\ninterpreter of German poetry to his own countrymen, deserve always to be\r\ngratefully remembered.  \"You have made me hunger and thirst after German\r\npoetry,\" wrote Southey to him, February 24, 1799.[27]\r\n\r\nThe year 1796, then, marks the confluence of the English and German\r\nromantic movements.  It seems a little strange that so healthy a genius\r\nas Walter Scott should have made his _dèbut_ in an exhibition of the\r\nhorrible.  Lockhart reports him, on the authority of Sir Alexander Wood,\r\nas reading his \"William and Helen\" over to that gentleman \"in a very slow\r\nand solemn tone,\" and then looking at the fire in silence and presently\r\nexclaiming.  \"I wish to Heaven I could get a skull and two crossbones.\"\r\nWhereupon Sir Alexander accompanied him to the house of John Bell,\r\nsurgeon, where the desired articles were obtained and mounted upon the\r\npoet's bookcase.  During the next few years, Scott continued to make\r\ntranslations of German ballads, romances, and chivalry dramas.  These\r\nremained for the present in manuscript; and some of them, indeed, such as\r\nhis versions of Babo's \"Otto von Wittelsbach\" (1796-97) and Meier's\r\n\"Wolfred von Dromberg\" (1797) were never permitted to see the light.  His\r\nsecond publication (February, 1799) was a free translation of Goethe's\r\ntragedy, \"Götz von Berlichingen mit der Eisernen Hand.\"  The original was\r\na most influential work in Germany.  It had been already twenty-six years\r\nbefore the public and had produced countless imitations, with some of\r\nwhich Scott had been busy before he encountered this, the fountain head\r\nof the whole flood of _Ritterschauspiele_.[28]  Götz was an historical\r\ncharacter, a robber knight of Franconia in the fifteenth century, who had\r\nchampioned the rights of the free knights to carry on private warfare and\r\nhad been put under the ban of the empire for engaging in feuds.  \"It\r\nwould be difficult,\" wrote Carlyle, \"to name two books which have\r\nexercised a deeper influence on the subsequent literature of\r\nEurope\"--than \"The Sorrows of Werther\" and \"Gotz.\"  \"The fortune of\r\n'Berlichingen with the Iron Hand,' though less sudden\"--than\r\nWerther's--\"was by no means less exalted.  In his own country 'Götz,'\r\nthough he now stands solitary and childless, became the parent of an\r\ninnumerable progeny of chivalry plays, feudal delineations, and\r\npoetico-antiquarian performances; which, though long ago deceased, made\r\nnoise enough in their day and generation; and with ourselves his\r\ninfluence has been perhaps still more remarkable.  Sir Walter Scott's\r\nfirst literary enterprise was a translation of 'Götz von Berlichingen';\r\nand if genius could be communicated, like instruction, we might call this\r\nwork of Goethe's the prime cause of 'Marmion' and 'The Lady of the Lake,'\r\nwith all that has since followed from the same creative hand. . .  How\r\nfar 'Götz von Berlichingen' actually affected Scott's literary\r\ndestination, and whether without it the rhymed romances, and then the\r\nprose romances of the author of Waverly, would not have followed as they\r\ndid, must remain a very obscure question; obscure and not important.  Of\r\nthe fact, however, there is no doubt, that these two tendencies, which\r\nmay be named Götzism and Wertherism, of the former of which Scott was\r\nrepresentative with us, have made and are still in some quarters making\r\nthe tour of all Europe.  In Germany, too, there was this affectionate,\r\nhalf-regretful looking-back into the past: Germany had its buff-belted,\r\nwatch-tower period in literature, and had even got done with it before\r\nScott began.\"[29]\r\n\r\nElsewhere Carlyle protests against the common English notion that German\r\nliterature dwells \"with peculiar complacency among wizards and ruined\r\ntowers, with mailed knights, secret tribunals, monks, specters, and\r\nbanditti. . .  If any man will insist on taking Heinse's 'Ardinghello'\r\nand Miller's 'Siegwart,' the works of Veit Weber the Younger, and above\r\nall the everlasting Kotzebue,[30] as his specimens of German literature,\r\nhe may establish many things.  Black Forests and the glories of\r\nLubberland, sensuality and horror, the specter nun and the charmed\r\nmoonshine shall not be wanting.  Boisterous outlaws also, with huge\r\nwhiskers and the most cat-o'-mountain aspect; tear-stained\r\nsentimentalists, the grimmest man-haters, ghosts and the like suspicious\r\ncharacters will be found in abundance.  We are little read in this\r\nbowl-and-dagger department; but we do understand it to have been at one\r\ntime rather diligently cultivated; though at present it seems to be\r\nmostly relinquished. . .  What should we think of a German critic that\r\nselected his specimens of British literature from 'The Castle Specter,'\r\nMr. Lewis' 'Monk,' or the 'Mysteries of Udolpho,' and 'Frankenstein, or\r\nthe Modern Prometheus'?. . .  'Faust,' for instance, passes with many of\r\nus for a mere tale of sorcery and art magic.  It would scarcely be more\r\nunwise to consider 'Hamlet' as depending for its main interest on the\r\nghost that walks in it.\"[31]\r\n\r\nNow for the works here named, as for the whole class of melodramas and\r\nmelodramatic romances which swarmed in Germany during the last quarter of\r\nthe century and made their way into English theaters and circulating\r\nlibraries, in the shape of translations, adaptations, imitations, two\r\nplays were remotely responsible: Goethe's \"Götz\" (1773), with its robber\r\nknights, secret tribunal, imperialist troopers, gypsies, and insurgent\r\npeasants; and Schiller's \"Die Räuber\" (1781), with its still more violent\r\nsituations and more formidable _dramatis personae_.  True, this spawn of\r\nthe _Sturm- und Drangzeit_, with its dealings in banditti, monks,\r\ninquisitors, confessionals, torture and poison, dungeon and rack, the\r\nhaunted tower, the yelling ghost, and the solitary cell, had been\r\nanticipated in England by Walpole's \"Castle of Otranto\" and \"Mysterious\r\nMother\"; but this slender native stream was now quite overwhelmed in the\r\nturbid flood of sensational matter from the Black Forest and the Rhine.\r\nMrs. Radcliffe herself had drunk from foreign sources.  In 1794 she made\r\nthe tour of the Rhine and published a narrative of her journey in the\r\nyear following.  The knightly river had not yet become hackneyed;\r\nBrentano had not invented nor Heine sung the seductive charms of the\r\nLürlei; nor Byron mused upon \"the castled crag of Drachenfels.\"  The\r\nFrench armies were not far off, and there were alarums and excursions all\r\nalong the border.  But the fair traveler paused upon many a spot already\r\nsacred to legend and song: the Mouse Tower and Rolandseck and the Seven\r\nMountains.  She noted the peasants, in their picturesque costumes,\r\ncarrying baskets of soil to the steep vineyard terraces: the ruined keeps\r\nof robber barons on the heights, and the dark sweep of the romantic\r\nvalleys, bringing in their tributary streams from north and south.\r\n\r\nLockhart says that Scott's translations of \"Götz\" should have been\r\npublished ten years sooner to have had its full effect.  For the English\r\npublic had already become sated with the melodramas and romances of\r\nKotzebue and the other German _Kraftmänner_; and the clever parody of\r\n\"The Robbers,\" under the title of \"The Rovers,\" which Canning and Ellis\r\nhad published in the _Anti-Jacobin_, had covered the entire species with\r\nridicule.  The vogue of this class of fiction, the chivalry romance, the\r\nfeudal drama, the robber play and robber novel, the monkish tale and the\r\nghost story (_Ritterstück, Ritteroman, Räuberstuck, Räuberroman,\r\nKlostergeschichte, Gespensterlied_) both in Germany and England,\r\nsatisfied, however crudely, the longing of the time for freedom,\r\nadventure, strong action, and emotion.  As Lowell said of the\r\ntranscendental movement in New England, it was a breaking of windows to\r\nget at the fresh air.  Laughable as many of them seem today, with their\r\nimprobable plots and exaggerated characters, they met a need which had\r\nnot been met either by the rationalizing wits of the Augustan age or by\r\nthe romanticizing poets who followed them with their elegiac refinement,\r\nand their unimpassioned strain of reflection and description.  They\r\nappeared, for the moment, to be the new avatar of the tragic muse whereof\r\nAkenside and Collins and Warton had prophesied, the answer to their\r\ndemand for something wild and primitive, for the return into poetry of\r\nthe _Naturton_, and the long-absent power of exciting the tragic\r\nemotions, pity and terror.  This spirit infected not merely the\r\ndepartment of the chivalry play and the Gothic romance, but prose fiction\r\nin general.  It is responsible for morbid and fantastic creations like\r\nBeckford's \"Vathek,\" Godwin's \"St. Leon\" and \"Caleb Williams,\" Mrs.\r\nShelley's \"Frankenstein,\" Shelley's \"Zastrozzi\" and \"St. Irvine the\r\nRosicrucian,\" and the American Charles Brockden Brown's \"Ormond\" and\r\n\"Wieland,\" forerunners of Hawthorne and Poe; tales of sleep-walkers and\r\nventriloquists, of persons who are in pursuit of the _elixir vitae_, or\r\nwho have committed the unpardonable sin, or who manufacture monsters in\r\ntheir laboratories, or who walk about in the Halls of Eblis, carrying\r\ntheir burning hearts in their hands.\r\n\r\nLockhart, however, denies that \"Götz von Berlichingen\" had anything in\r\ncommon with the absurdities which Canning made fun of in the\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_.  He says that it was a \"broad, bold, free, and most\r\npicturesque delineation of real characters, manners, and events.\"  He\r\nthinks that in the robber barons of the Rhine, with \"their forays upon\r\neach other's domains, the besieged castles, the plundered herds, the\r\ncaptive knights, the brow-beaten bishop and the baffled liege-lord,\"\r\nScott found a likeness to the old life of the Scotch border, with its\r\nmoss-troopers, cattle raids, and private warfare; and that, as Percy's\r\n\"Reliques\" prompted the \"Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,\" so \"Götz\"\r\nprompted the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel\" and \"Marmion.\"  He quotes the\r\npassage from \"Götz\" where Selbiss is borne in, wounded, by two troopers\r\nwho ascend a watch-tower and describe to their leader the further\r\nprogress of the battle; and he asks \"who does not recognize in Goethe's\r\ndrama the true original of the death scene in 'Marmion' and the storm in\r\n'Ivanhoe'?\"\r\n\r\nA singular figure now comes upon our stage, Matthew Gregory Lewis,\r\ncommonly nicknamed \"Monk\" Lewis, from the title of his famous romance.\r\nIt is a part of the irony of things that so robust a muse as Walter\r\nScott's should have been nursed in infancy by a little creature like\r\nLewis.  His \"Monk\" had been published in 1795, when the author was only\r\ntwenty.  In 1798 Scott's friend William Erskine meet Lewis in London.\r\nThe latter was collecting materials for his \"Tales of Wonder,\" and when\r\nErskine showed him Scott's \"William and Helen\" and \"The Wild Huntsman,\"\r\nand told him that he had other things of the kind in manuscript, Lewis\r\nbegged that Scott would contribute to his collection.  Erskine\r\naccordingly put him in communication with Scott, who felt highly\r\nflattered by the Monk's request, and wrote to him that his ballads were\r\nquite at his service.  Lewis replied, thanking him for the offer.  \"A\r\nghost or a witch,\" he wrote, \"is a _sine qua non_ ingredient in all the\r\ndishes of which I mean to compose my hobgoblin repast.\"  Later in the\r\nsame year Lewis came to Edinburgh and was introduced to Scott, who found\r\nhim an odd contrast to the grewsome horrors of his books, being a\r\ncheerful, foppish, round-faced little man, a follower of fashion and an\r\nassiduous tuft-hunter.  \"Mat had queerish eyes,\" writes his _protégé_:\r\n\"they projected like those of some insects, and were flattish on the\r\norbit.  His person was extremely small and boyish--he was indeed the\r\nleast man I ever saw, to be strictly well and neatly made. . .  This\r\nboyishness went through life with him.  He was a child and a spoiled\r\nchild, but a child of high imagination; and so he wasted himself on ghost\r\nstories and German romances.  He had the finest ear for rhythm I ever met\r\nwith--finer than Byron's.\"\r\n\r\nByron, by the way, had always a kindly feeling for Lewis, though he\r\nlaughed at him in \"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers\":\r\n\r\n    \"O wonder-working Lewis, Monk or Bard,\r\n    Who fain would'st make Parnassus a churchyard;\r\n    Lo! wreaths of yew, not laurel, bind thy brow;\r\n    Thy muse a sprite, Apollo's sexton thou;\r\n    Whether on ancient tombs thou tak'st thy stand,\r\n    By gibbering specters hailed, thy kindred band,\r\n    Or tracest chaste descriptions on thy page,\r\n    To please the females of our modest age--\r\n    All hail, M. P.,[32] from whose infernal brain\r\n    Thin-sheeted phantoms glide, a grisly train;\r\n    At whose command grim women thron in crowds,\r\n    And kings of fire, of water and of clouds,\r\n    With 'small gray men,' wild yagers and what not,\r\n    To crown with honor thee and Walter Scott!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1816, while on his way to Italy, Lewis sojourned for a space with\r\nByron and Shelley in their Swiss retreat and set the whole company\r\ncomposing goblin stories.  The most remarkable outcome of this queer\r\nsymposium was Mrs. Shelley's abnormal romance, \"Frankenstein.\"  The\r\nsignatures of Byron and Shelley are affixed, as witnesses, to a codicil\r\nto Lewis' will, which he drew at this time and dated at Maison Diodati,\r\nGeneva; a somewhat rhetorical document in which he provided for the\r\nprotection of the slaves on his Jamaica plantations.  It was two years\r\nafter this, and on his return voyage from a visit to these West Indian\r\nestates, that Lewis died of yellow fever and was buried at sea.  Byron\r\nmade this note of it in his diary:\r\n\r\n    \"I'd give the lands of Deloraine\r\n    Dark Musgrave were alive again,\"\r\n\r\nthat is,\r\n\r\n    \"I would give many a sugar cane\r\n    Monk Lewis were alive again.\"\r\n\r\nScott's modesty led him to depreciate his own verses as compared with\r\nLewis', some of which he recited to Ballantyne, in 1799, speaking of\r\ntheir author, says Lockhart, \"with rapture.\"  But however fine an ear for\r\nrhythm Lewis may have had, his verse is for the most part execrable; and\r\nhis jaunty, jiggling anapaests and pragmatic manner are ludicrously out\r\nof keeping with the horrors of his tale, increasing the air of bathos\r\nwhich distinguishes his poetry:\r\n\r\n    \"A toad still alive in the liquor she threw,\r\n    And loud shrieked the toad as in pieces it flew:\r\n    And ever, the cauldron as over she bent,\r\n    She muttered strange words of mysterious intent:\"\r\n\r\nor this from the same ballad:[33]\r\n\r\n    \"Wild laughing, the Fiend caught the hand from the floor,\r\n    Releasing the babe, kissed the wound, drank the gore;\r\n    A little jet ring from her finger then drew,\r\n    Thrice shrieked a loud shriek and was borne from their view.\"\r\n\r\nLewis would appear to have inherited his romantic turn from his mother, a\r\nsentimental little dame whose youthful looks caused her often to be taken\r\nfor Mat's sister, and whose reading was chiefly confined to novels.  The\r\npoor lady was something of a blue-stocking and aspired, herself, to\r\nliterary honors.  Lewis' devotion to her is very charming, and the\r\nelder-brotherly tone of his letters to her highly amusing.  But he had a\r\ndislike of \"female authorship\": and the rumor having reached his ear that\r\nhis mother had written a novel and a tragedy and was preparing to print\r\nthem, he wrote to her in alarm, begging her to stay her hand.  \"I hold\r\nthat a woman has no business to be a public character, and that, in\r\nproportion as she acquires notoriety, she loses delicacy.  I always\r\nconsider a female author as a sort of half-man.\"  He was also, quite\r\nproperly, shocked at some gossip which attributed \"The Monk,\" to his\r\nmother instead of to his mother's son.\r\n\r\nWe read in the \"Life and Correspondence of Matthew Gregory Lewis\" (2\r\nvols., London, 1839), that one of Mrs. Lewis' favorite books was \"Glanvil\r\non Witches.\"  Glanvil was the seventeenth-century writer whose \"Vanity of\r\nDogmatizing,\"[34] and \"Sadduceismus Triumphatus\" rebuked the doubter and\r\nfurnished arguments for Cotton Mather's \"Wonders of the Invisible World\"\r\n(1693), an apology for his share in the Salem witchcraft trials; and\r\nwhose description of a ghostly drum, that was heard to beat every night\r\nin a Wiltshire country house, gave Addison the hint for his comedy of\r\n\"The Drummer.\"  Young Lewis gloated with a pleasing horror over Glanvil's\r\npages and the wonderful copperplates which embellished them; particularly\r\nthe one which represents the devil beating his airy tympanum over Mr.\r\nMompesson's house.  In the ancient mansion of Stanstead Hall, belonging\r\nto a kinsman of his father, where the boy spent a part of his childhood,\r\nthere was a haunted chamber known as the cedar room.  \"In maturer years,\"\r\nsays his biographer, \"Lewis has frequently been heard to declare that at\r\nnight, when he was conducted past that gloomy chamber, on the way to his\r\ndormitory, he would cast a glance of terror over his shoulder, expecting\r\nto see the huge and strangely carved folding doors fly open and disclose\r\nsome of those fearful shapes that afterward resolved themselves into the\r\nghastly machinery of his works.\"\r\n\r\nLewis' first and most celebrated publication was \"Ambrosio, or the Monk\"\r\n(1795), a three-volume romance of the Gothic type, and a lineal\r\ndescendant of Walpole and Mrs. Radcliffe.  He began it at Oxford in 1792,\r\ndescribing it in a letter to his mother as \"a romance in the style of\r\n'The Castle of Otranto.'\"  But in the summer of the same year he went to\r\nGermany and took up his residence at Weimar, where he was introduced to\r\nGoethe and made eager acquaintance with the bizarre productions of the\r\n_Sturm- und Drangperiode_.  For years Lewis was one of the most active\r\nintermediaries between the German purveyors of the terrible and the\r\nEnglish literary market.  He fed the stage with melodramas and operas,\r\nand stuffed the closet reader with ballads and prose romances.[35]\r\nMeanwhile, being at The Hague in the summer of 1794, he resumed and\r\nfinished his \"Monk,\" in ten weeks.  \"I was induced to go on with it,\" he\r\nwrote to his mother, \"by reading the 'Mysteries of Udolpho,' which is, in\r\nmy opinion, one of the most interesting books that has ever been\r\npublished. . .  When you read it, tell me whether you think there is any\r\nresemblance between the character given of Montoni . . . and my own.  I\r\nconfess that it struck me.\"  This innocent vanity of fancying a likeness\r\nbetween Anne Radcliffe's dark-browed villain and his own cherubic\r\npersonality recalls Scott's story about the picture of Lewis, by\r\nSaunders, which was handed round at Dalkeith House.  \"The artist had\r\ningeniously flung a dark folding-mantle around the form, under which was\r\nhalf-hid a dagger, a dark lantern, or some cut-throat appurtenance; with\r\nall this, the features were preserved and ennobled.  It passed from hand\r\nto hand into that of Henry, Duke of Buccleuch, who, hearing the general\r\nvoice affirm that it was very like, said aloud, 'Like Mat Lewis!  Why,\r\nthat picture's like a man.'\"  \"The Monk\" used, and abused, the now\r\nfamiliar apparatus of Gothic romance.  It had Spanish grandees, heroines\r\nof dazzling beauty, bravoes and forest banditti, foolish duennas and\r\ngabbling domestics, monks, nuns, inquisitors, magic mirrors, enchanted\r\nwands, midnight incantations, sorcerers, ghosts, demons; haunted\r\nchambers, wainscoated in dark oak; moonlit castles with ruined towers and\r\nivied battlements, whose galleries rang with the shrieks and blasphemies\r\nof guilty spirits, and from whose portals issued, when the castle clock\r\ntolled one, the specter of a bleeding nun, with dagger and lamp in hand.\r\nThere were poisonings, stabbings, and ministrations of sleeping potions;\r\nbeauties who masqueraded as pages, and pages who masqueraded as wandering\r\nharpers; secret springs that gave admittance to winding stairs leading\r\ndown into the charnel vaults of convents, where erring sisters were\r\nimmured by cruel prioresses and fed on bread and water among the\r\nloathsome relics of the dead.\r\n\r\nWith all this, \"The Monk\" is a not wholly contemptible work.  There is a\r\ncertain narrative power about it which puts it much above the level of\r\n\"The Castle of Otranto.\"  And though it partakes of the stilted dialogue\r\nand false conception of character that abound in Mrs. Radcliffe's\r\nromances, it has neither the excess of scenery nor of sentiment which\r\ndistinguishes that very prolix narrator.  There is nothing strictly\r\nmediaeval about it.  The knight in armor cuts no figure and the\r\nhistorical period is not precisely indicated.  But the ecclesiastical\r\nfeatures lend it a semblance of mediaevalism; and one is reminded, though\r\nbut faintly, by the imprisonment of the offending sister in the sepulcher\r\nof the convent, of the scene in \"Marmion\" where Constance is immured in\r\nthe vaults of Lindisfarne--a frank anachronism, of course, on Scott's\r\npart, since Lindisfarne had been in ruins centuries before the battle of\r\nFlodden.  The motto from Horace on the title page of \"The Monk\" sums up\r\nits contents, and indeed the contents of most of its author's writings,\r\nprose and verse--\r\n\r\n    \"Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,\r\n    Nocturnos lemures portentaque.\"\r\n\r\nThe hero Ambrosio is the abbot of St. Francis' Capuchin monastery in\r\nMadrid; a man of rigid austerity, whose spiritual pride makes him an easy\r\nprey to the temptations of a female demon, who leads him by degrees\r\nthrough a series of crimes, including incest and parricide, until he\r\nfinally sells his soul to the devil to escape from the dungeons of the\r\nInquisition and the _auto da fe_, subscribing the agreement, in approved\r\nfashion, upon a parchment scroll with an iron pen dipped in blood from\r\nhis own veins.  The fiend, who enters with thunder and lightning, over\r\nwhose shoulders \"waved two enormous sable wings,\" and whose hair \"was\r\nsupplied by living snakes,\" then snatches up his victim and soars with\r\nhim to a peak of the Sierra Morena, where in a Salvator Rosa landscape of\r\ntorrents, cliffs, caverns, and pine forests, by the light of an opera\r\nmoon, and to the sound of the night wind sighing hoarsely and \"the shrill\r\ncry of mountain eagles,\" he drops him over a precipice and makes an end\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nA passage from the episode of Agnes de Medina, the incarcerated nun, will\r\nillustrate Lewis' wonder-working arts:  \"A faint glimmering of light\r\nwhich strained through the bars permitted me to distinguish the\r\nsurrounding horrors.  I was oppressed by a noisome, suffocating smell;\r\nand perceiving that the grated door was unfastened, I thought that I\r\nmight possibly effect my escape.  As I raised myself with this design, my\r\nhand rested upon something soft.  I grasped it and advanced it toward the\r\nlight.  Almighty God! what was my disgust! my consternation!  In spite of\r\nits putridity and the worms which preyed upon it, I perceived a corrupted\r\nhuman head, and recognized the features of a nun who had died some months\r\nbefore. . .  A sepulchral lamp was suspended from the roof by an iron\r\nchain and shed a gloomy light through the dungeon.  Emblems of death were\r\nseen on every side; skills, shoulder-blades, thigh-bones and other relics\r\nof mortality were scattered upon the dewy ground. . .  As I shrunk from\r\nthe cutting wind which howled through my subterraneous dwelling, the\r\nchange seemed so striking, so abrupt, that I doubted its reality. . .\r\nSometimes I felt the bloated toad, hideous and pampered with the\r\npoisonous vapors of the dungeon, dragging his loathsome length along my\r\nbosom; sometimes the quick, cold lizard roused me, leaving his slimy\r\ntrack upon my face, and entangling itself in the tresses of my wild and\r\nmatted hair.  Often have I, at waking, found my fingers ringed with the\r\nlong worms which bred in the corrupted flesh of my infant.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Monk\" won for its author an immediate and wide celebrity, assisted\r\nno doubt by the outcry against its immorality.  Lewis tried to defend\r\nhimself by pleading that the outline and moral of his story were borrowed\r\nfrom \"The History of Santon Barsisa\" in the _Guardian_ (No. 148).  But\r\nthe voluptuous nature of some of the descriptions induced the Attorney\r\nGeneral to enjoin the sale of the book, and Lewis bowed to public opinion\r\nso far as to suppress the objectionable passages in later editions.\r\nLewis' melodrama \"The Castle Specter\" was first performed December 14,\r\n1797, at Drury Lane, ran sixty nights and \"continued popular as an acting\r\nplay,\" says the biographer, \"up to a very recent period.\"[36]  This is\r\nstrong testimony to the contemporary appetite for nightmare, for the play\r\nis a trumpery affair.  Sheridan, who had a poor opinion of it, advised\r\nthe dramatist to keep the specter out of the last scene.  \"It had been\r\nsaid,\" explains Lewis in his preface, \"that if Mr. Sheridan had not\r\nadvised me to content myself with a single specter, I meant to have\r\nexhibited a whole regiment of ghosts.\"  The prologue, spoken by Mr.\r\nWroughton, invokes \"the fair enchantress, Romance\":\r\n\r\n    \"The moonstruck child of genius and of woe,\"\r\n\r\nwho\r\n\r\n    \"--Loathes the sun or blazing taper's light:\r\n    The moonbeamed landscape and tempestuous night\r\n    Alone she loves; and oft with glimmering lamp\r\n    Near graves new opened, or midst dungeons damp,\r\n    Drear forests, ruined aisles and haunted towers,\r\n    Forlorn she roves and raves away the hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene of the drama is Conway Castle in Wales, where abides Earl\r\nOsmond, a feudal tyrant of the \"Otranto\" type, who is planning an\r\nincestuous marriage with his own niece, concerning which he thus\r\nsoliloquizes: \"What though she prefer a basilisk's kiss to mine?  Because\r\nmy short-lived joy may cause her eternal sorrow, shall I reject those\r\npleasures sought so long, desired so earnestly?  That will I not, by\r\nHeaven!  Mine she is, and mine she shall be, though Reginald's bleeding\r\nghost flit before me and thunder in my ear 'Hold! Hold!'--Peace, stormy\r\nheart, she comes.\"  Reginald's ghost does not flit, because Reginald is\r\nstill in the flesh, though not in very much flesh.  He is Osmond's\r\nbrother and Angela's father, and the wicked Earl thought that he had\r\nmurdered him.  It turns out, however, that, though left for dead, he had\r\nrecovered of his hurts and has been kept unbeknown in solitary\r\nconfinement, in a dungeon vault under the castle, for the somewhat long\r\nperiod of sixteen years.  He is discovered in Act V., \"emaciated, in\r\ncoarse garments, his hair hanging wildly about his face, and a chain\r\nbound round his body.\"\r\n\r\nReginald's ghost does not flit, but Evelina's does.  Evelina is\r\nReginald's murdered wife, and her specter in \"white and flowing garments,\r\nspotted with blood,\" appears to Angela in the oratory communicating with\r\nthe cedar room, which is furnished with an antique bedstead and the\r\nportrait of a lady on a sliding panel.  In truth, the castle is\r\nuncommonly well supplied with apparitions.  Earl Herbert rides around it\r\nevery night on a white horse; Lady Bertha haunts the west pinnacle of the\r\nchapel tower; and Lord Hildebrand may be seen any midnight in the great\r\nhall, playing football with his own head.  So says Motley the jester, who\r\naffords the comedy element of the play, with the help of a fat friar who\r\nguzzles sack and stuffs venison pasties, and a soubrette after the\r\n\"Otranto\" pattern.\r\n\r\nA few poems were scattered through the pages of \"The Monk,\" including a\r\nballad from the Danish, and another from the Spanish.  But the most\r\nfamous of these was \"Alonzo the Brave and the Fair Imogene,\" original\r\nwith Lewis, though evidently suggested by \"Lenore.\"  It tells how a lover\r\nwho had gone to Palestine presented himself at the bridal feast of his\r\nfaithless fair one, just as the clock struck one and the lights burned\r\nblue.  At the request of the company, the strange knight raises his visor\r\nand discloses a skeleton head:\r\n\r\n    \"All present then uttered a terrified shout;\r\n      All turned with disgust from the scene;\r\n    The worms they crept in and the worms they crept out,\r\n    And sported his eyes and his temples about\r\n      While the spectre addressed Imogene.\"\r\n\r\nHe winds his arms about her and sinks with his prey through the yawning\r\nground; and\r\n\r\n    \"At midnight four times in each year does her sprite,\r\n      When mortals in slumber are bound.\r\n    Arrayed in her bridal apparel of white,\r\n    Appear in the hall with a skeleton knight\r\n      And shriek as he whirls her around.\r\n\r\n    \"While they drink out of skulls newly torn from the grave,\r\n      Dancing round them pale spectres are seen.\r\n    Their liquor is blood, and this horrible stave\r\n    They how: 'To the health of Alonzo the Brave\r\n      And his consort, the Fair Imogene!'\"\r\n\r\nLewis' own contributions to his \"Tales of Terror\" and \"Tales of Wonder,\"\r\nwere of his same raw-head and bloody-bones variety.  His imagination\r\nrioted in physical horrors.  There are demons who gnash with iron fangs\r\nand brandish gore-fed scorpions; maidens are carried off by the Winter\r\nKing, the Water King, the Cloud King, and the Sprite of the Glen; they\r\nare poisoned or otherwise done to death, and their wraiths revisit their\r\nguilty lovers in their shrouds at midnight's dark hour and imprint clammy\r\nkisses upon them with livid lips; gray friars and black canons abound;\r\nrequiem and death knell sound through the gloom of the cloisters; echo\r\nroars through high Gothic arches; the anchorite mutters in his mossy\r\ncell; tapers burn dim, torches cast a red glare on vaulted roofs; the\r\nnight wind blows through dark aisles; the owl hoots in the turret, and\r\ndying groans are heard in the lonely house upon the heath, where the\r\nblack and tattered arras molders on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe \"Tales of Wonder\" included translations by Lewis from Goethe's\r\n\"Fisher\" and \"Erl-King,\" and from German versions of Runic ballads in\r\nHerder's \"Stimmen der Völker.\"  Scott's \"Wild Huntsman,\" from Bürger, was\r\nhere reprinted, and he contributed, in addition, \"Frederick and Alice,\"\r\nparaphrased from a romance-fragment in Goethe's opera \"Claudina von Villa\r\nBella\"; and three striking ballads of his own, \"The Fire King,\" a story\r\nof the Crusades, and \"Glenfinlas\" and \"The Eve of St. John,\" Scottish\r\ntales of \"gramarye.\"  There were two or three old English ballads in the\r\ncollection, such as \"Clerk Colvin\" and \"Tam Lin\"; a contribution from\r\nGeorge Colman, Jr., the dramatist, and one from Scott's eccentric friend\r\nLeyden; and the volume concluded with Taylor's \"Lenora.\"[37]\r\n\r\nIt is comical to read that the Monk gave Scott lectures in the art of\r\nversification and corrected the Scotticisms and false rhymes in his\r\ntranslations from Bürger; and that Scott respectfully deferred to his\r\nadvice.  For nothing can be in finer contrast with Lewis' penny dreadful,\r\nthan the martial ring of the verse and the manly vigor of the style in\r\nScott's part of the book.  This is how Lewis writes anapaests, _e.g._:\r\n\r\n    \"All shrouded she was in the garb of the tomb,\r\n      Her lips they were livid, her face it was wan;\r\n    A death the most horrid had rifled her bloom\r\n      And each charm of beauty was faded and gone.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this is how Scott writes them:\r\n\r\n    \"He clenched his set teeth and his gauntleted hand,\r\n    He stretched with one buffet that page on the sand. . .\r\n    For down came the Templars like Cedron in flood,\r\n    And dyed their long lances in Saracen blood.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no more possible to take Monk Lewis seriously than to take Horace\r\nWalpole seriously.  They are both like children telling ghost-stories in\r\nthe dark and trying to make themselves shudder.  Lewis was even frivolous\r\nenough to compose paradies on his own ballads.  A number of these\r\n_facetiae_--\"The Mud King,\" \"Giles Jollup the Grave and Brown Sally\r\nGreen,\" etc.--diversify his \"Tales of Wonder.\"\r\n\r\nScott soon found better work for his hands to do than translating German\r\nballads and melodramas; but in later years he occasionally went back to\r\nthese early sources of romantic inspiration.  Thus his poem \"The Noble\r\nMoringer\" was taken from a \"Sammlung Deutscher Volkslieder\" published at\r\nBerlin in 1807 by Busching and Von der Hagen.  In 1799 he had made a\r\n_rifacimento_ of a melodrama entitles \"Der Heilige Vehme\" in Veit Weber's\r\n\"Sagen der Vorzeit.\"  This he found among his papers thirty years after\r\n(1829) and printed in \"The Keepsake,\" under the title of \"The House of\r\nAspen.\"  Its most telling feature is the description of the Vehm-Gericht\r\nor Secret Tribunal, but it has little importance.  In his \"Historic\r\nSurvey,\" Taylor said that \"Götz von Berlichingen\" was \"translated into\r\nEnglish in 1799 at Edinburgh, by Wm. Scott, Advocate; no doubt the same\r\nperson who, under the poetical but assumed name of Walter, had since\r\nbecome the most extensively popular of the British writers\"!  This\r\namazing statement is explained by a blunder on the title-page of Scott's\r\n\"Götz,\" where the translator's name is given as _William_ Scott.  But it\r\nled to a slightly acrimonious correspondence between Sir Walter and the\r\nNorwich reviewer.[38]\r\n\r\nThe tide of German romance had begun to ebb before the close of the\r\ncentury.  It rose again a few years later, and left perhaps more lasting\r\ntokens this second time; but the ripple-marks of its first invasion are\r\nstill discernible in English poetry and prose.  Southey was clearly in\r\nerror when he wrote to Taylor, September 5, 1798: \"Coleridge's ballad,\r\n'The Ancient Mariner' is, I think, the clumsiest attempt at German\r\nsublimity I ever saw.\"[39]  The \"Mariner\" is not in the least German, and\r\nwhen he wrote it, Coleridge had not been in Germany and did not know the\r\nlanguage.  He had read \"Die Rauber,\" to be sure, some years before in\r\nTytler's translation.  He was at Cambridge at the time, and one night in\r\nwinter, on leaving the room of a college friend, carelessly picked up and\r\ntook away with him a copy of the tragedy, the very name of which he had\r\nnever heard before.  \"A winter midnight, the wind high and 'The Robbers'\r\nfor the first time.  The readers of Schiller will conceive what I felt.\"\r\nHe recorded, in the sonnet \"To Schiller\" (written December, 1794, or\r\nJanuary, 1795), the terrific impression left upon his imagination by\r\n\r\n               --\"The famished father's cry\r\n    From the dark dungeon of the tower time-rent,\"\r\n\r\nand wish that he might behold the bard himself, wandering at eve--\r\n\r\n    \"Beneath some vast old tempest-swinging wood.\"\r\n\r\nColeridge was destined to make the standard translation of \"Wallenstein\";\r\nand there are motives borrowed from \"The Robbers\" and \"The Ghost-Seer\" in\r\nhis own very rubbishy dramas, \"Zapolya\"--of which Scott made some use in\r\n\"Peveril of the Peak\"--and \"Osorio\" (1797).  The latter was rewritten as\r\n\"Remorse,\" put on at Drury Lane January 23, 1813, and ran twenty nights.\r\nIt had been rejected by Sheridan, who expressed a very proper contempt\r\nfor it as an acting play.  The Rev. W. L. Bowles and Byron, who had read\r\nit in manuscript and strangely overvalued it, both made interest with the\r\nmanager to have it tried on the stage.  \"Remorse\" also took some hints\r\nfrom Lewis' \"Monk.\"\r\n\r\nBut Coleridge came in time to hold in low esteem, if not precisely \"The\r\nRobbers\" itself, yet that school of German melodrama of which it was the\r\ngrand exemplar.  In the twenty-third chapter of the \"Biographia\r\nLiteraria\" (1817) he reviewed with severity the Rev. Charles Robert\r\nMaturin's tragedy \"Bertram, or the Castle of St. Aldobrand,\"[40] and\r\nincidentally gave the genesis of that whole theatric species \"which it\r\nhas been the fashion, of late years, at once to abuse and to enjoy under\r\nthe name of the German Drama.  Of this latter Schiller's 'Robbers' was\r\nthe earliest specimen, the first-fruits of his youth. . .  Only as _such_\r\ndid the maturer judgment of the author tolerate the play.\"  Coleridge\r\navows that \"The Robbers\" and its countless imitations were due to the\r\npopularity in Germany of the translations of Young's \"Night Thoughts,\"\r\nHervey's \"Meditations,\" and Richardson's \"Clarissa Harlowe.\"  \"Add the\r\nruined castles, the dungeons, the trap-doors, the skeletons, the\r\nflesh-and-blood ghosts, and the perpetual moonshine of a modern\r\nauthor[41] (themselves the literary brood of the 'Castle of Otranto,' the\r\ntranslations of which, with the imitations and improvements aforesaid,\r\nwere about that time beginning to make as much noise in Germany as their\r\noriginals were making in England), and, as the compound of these\r\ningredients duly mixed, you will recognize the so-called _German_ Drama,\"\r\nwhich \"is English in its origin, English in its materials, and English by\r\nreadoption; and till we can prove that Kotzebue, or any of the whole\r\nbreed of Kotzebues, whether dramatists or romantic writers or writers of\r\nromantic dramas, were ever admitted to any other shelf in the libraries\r\nof well-educated Germans than were occupied by their originals . . . in\r\ntheir mother country, we should submit to carry our own brat on our own\r\nshoulders.\"\r\n\r\nGermany, rather than Italy or Spain, became under these influences for a\r\ntime the favored country of romance.  English tale-writers chose its\r\nforests and dismantled castles as the scenes of their stories of\r\nbrigandage and assassination.  One of the best of a bad class of\r\nfictions, _e.g._, was Harriet Lee's \"The German's Tale: Kruitzner,\" in\r\nthe series of \"Canterbury Tales\" written in conjunction with her sister\r\nSophia (1797-1805).  Byron read it when he was fourteen, was profoundly\r\nimpressed by it, and made it the basis of \"Werner,\" the only drama of his\r\nwhich had any stage success.  \"Kruitzner\" is conceived with some power,\r\nbut monotonously and ponderously written.  The historic period is the\r\nclose of the Thirty Years' War.  It does not depend mainly for its effect\r\nupon the time-honored \"Gothic\" machinery, though it makes a moderate use\r\nof the sliding panel and secret passage once again.\r\n\r\nWe are come to the gate of the new century, to the date of the \"Lyrical\r\nBallads\" (1798) and within sight of the Waverly novels.  Looking back\r\nover the years elapsed since Thomson put forth his \"Winter,\" in 1726, we\r\nask ourselves what the romantic movement in England had done for\r\nliterature; if indeed that deserves to be called a \"movement\" which had\r\nno leader, no programme, no organ, no theory of art, and very little\r\ncoherence.  True, as we have learned from the critical writings of the\r\ntime, the movement, such as it was, was not all unconscious of its own\r\naims and directions.  The phrase \"School of Warton\" implies a certain\r\nsolidarity, and there was much interchange of views and some personal\r\ncontact between men who were in literary sympathy; some skirmishing, too,\r\nbetween opposing camps.  Gray, Walpole, and Mason constitute a group,\r\nencouraging each other's studies in their correspondence and occasional\r\nmeetings.  Shenstone was interested in Percy's ballad collections, and\r\nGray in Warton's \"History of English Poetry.\"  Akenside read Dyer's\r\n\"Fleece,\" and Gray read Beattie's \"Minstrel\" in MS.  The Wartons were\r\nfriends of Collins; Collins a friend and neighbor of Thomson; and Thomson\r\na frequent visitor at Hagley and the Leasowes.  Chatterton sought to put\r\nRowley under Walpole's protection, and had his verses examined by Mason\r\nand Gray.  Still, upon the whole, the English romanticists had little\r\ncommunity; they worked individually and were scattered and isolated as to\r\ntheir residence, occupations, and social affiliation.  It does not appear\r\nthat Gray ever met Collins, or the Wartons, or Shenstone or Akenside; nor\r\nthat MacPherson, Clara Reeve, Mrs. Radcliffe, and Chatterton ever saw\r\neach other or any of those first mentioned.  There was none of that\r\nunited purpose and that eager partisanship which distinguished the\r\nParisian _cénacle Romantische Schule_ whose members have been so\r\nbrilliantly sketched by Heine.\r\n\r\nBut call it a movement, or simply a drift, a trend; what had it done for\r\nliterature?  In the way of stimulus and preparation, a good deal.  It had\r\nrelaxed the classical bandages, widened the range of sympathy, roused a\r\ncuriosity as to novel and diverse forms of art, and brought the literary\r\nmind into a receptive, expectant attitude favorable to original creative\r\nactivity.  There never was a generation more romantic in temper than that\r\nwhich stepped upon the stage at the close of the eighteenth century: a\r\ngeneration fed upon \"Ossian\" and Rousseau and \"The Sorrows of Werther\"\r\nand Percy's \"Reliques\" and Mrs. Radcliffe's romances.  Again, in the\r\ndepartment of literary and antiquarian scholarship much had been\r\naccomplished.  Books like Tyrwhitt's \"Chaucer\" and Warton's \"History of\r\nEnglish Poetry\" had a real importance, while the collection and\r\npreservation of old English poetry, before it was too late, by scholars\r\nlike Percy, Ritson, Ellis, and others was a pious labor.\r\n\r\nBut if we inquire what positive additions had been made to the modern\r\nliterature of England, the reply is disappointing.  No one will maintain\r\nthat the Rowley poems, \"Caractacus,\" \"The Monk,\" \"The Grave of King\r\nArthur,\" \"The Friar of Orders Gray,\" \"The Castle of Otranto,\" and \"The\r\nMysteries of Udolpho\" are things of permanent value: or even that \"The\r\nBard,\" \"The Castle of Indolence,\" and the \"Poems of Ossian\" take rank\r\nwith the work done in the same spirit by Coleridge, Scott, Keats,\r\nRossetti, and William Morris.  The two leading British poets of the _fin\r\ndu siècle_, Cowper and Burns, were not among the romanticists.  It was\r\nleft for the nineteenth century to perform the work of which the\r\neighteenth only prophesied.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Scherer's \"History of German Literature,\" Conybeare's Translation,\r\nVol. II, p. 26.\r\n\r\n[2] Scherer, Vol. II. pp. 123-24.\r\n\r\n[3] See _ante_, pp. 300-301.\r\n\r\n[4] See _ante_, pp. 337-38.\r\n\r\n[5] \"The Beauties of Shakspere.
