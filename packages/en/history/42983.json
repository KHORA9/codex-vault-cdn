C. HEMMEON, PH.D.\r\n\r\n_PUBLISHED FROM THE INCOME OF THE\r\nWILLIAM H. BALDWIN, JR., 1885, FUND_\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY\r\n1912\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1912, BY THE PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE\r\n\r\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\r\n\r\n_Published January 1912_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn justice to those principles which influenced the policy of the Post\r\nOffice before the introduction of penny postage, it is perhaps\r\nunnecessary to call attention to the fact that no opinion as to their\r\ndesirability or otherwise is justifiable which does not take into\r\nconsideration the conditions and prejudices which then prevailed. Some\r\nof the earlier writers on the Post Office have made the mistake of\r\ncondemning everything which has not satisfied the measure of their own\r\nparticular rule. If there is anything that the historical treatment of a\r\nsubject teaches the investigator it is an appreciation of the fact that\r\ndifferent conditions call for different methods of treatment. For\r\nexample, the introduction of cheap postage was possibly delayed too\r\nlong. But during the era of high postal rates a large net revenue was of\r\nprimary importance, nor were those conditions present which would have\r\nmade low rates a success.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of such debatable subjects as the telegraph system of\r\nthe Postal Department and the department's attitude toward the telephone\r\ncompanies, as well as the intention of the Post Office to acquire the\r\nbusiness of the latter, must necessarily give rise to controversy.\r\nThanks to the magnificent net revenue obtained from letters in the\r\nUnited Kingdom the department has been able to lose a good deal of money\r\nby the extension of its activities into the realm of affairs not purely\r\npostal. Possibly a _democratic_ type of government should, from the\r\nfinancial point of view, interfere least in the direct management of\r\neconomic institutions, on account of the pressure which can easily be\r\nbrought to bear upon it for the extension of such institutions on other\r\nthan economic grounds. If non-economic principles are to be substituted\r\nin justifying the initiation or increase of government ownership, a\r\npopular form of government seems the least suitable for the presentation\r\nof such as shall be fair to all concerned, not to mention the difficult\r\nproblem of dealing with those members of the civil service who do not\r\nhesitate to make use of their political power to enforce their demands\r\nupon the government.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of a subject so complex as the history of the British\r\nPost Office it is not easy to decide how far its presentation should be\r\nstrictly chronological or how far it should be mounted in \"longitudinal\r\nsections,\" exposing its most salient features. Both methods have their\r\nadvantages and their disadvantages. In order to obtain what is useful in\r\nboth, I have described chronologically in the first four chapters the\r\nprogress of the Post Office, while in the remaining chapters I have\r\nexamined separately some of the more important aspects of postal\r\ndevelopment. But I am aware that by this compromise I have not entirely\r\nescaped the dangers of abrupt transitions from subject to subject and of\r\nthe accumulation of dry details. I can only plead in extenuation, in the\r\nfirst place the nature of my subject, an institution with a long and\r\nvaried history, characterized by the steady extension of its field of\r\nactivity, and in the second place my desire to make my study as thorough\r\nas possible, even at the risk of some sacrifice of unity and interest of\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThe material for this sketch has been obtained from the Harvard\r\nUniversity Library, the Boston Public Library, and the Canadian\r\nParliamentary Library. Work was also done in the Library of the British\r\nMuseum. I wish to acknowledge the help I have received from the advice\r\nand criticism of Professor Gay, under whose supervision the larger part\r\nof this history was prepared.\r\n\r\n                                            J.

Long before this, however, a system of communication\r\nhad been established both for the personal use of the King and for the\r\nconveyance of official letters and documents. These continued to be the\r\nprincipal functions of the royal posts until well on in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nBefore the sixteenth century, postal communications were carried on by\r\nroyal messengers. These messengers either received stated wages or were\r\npaid according to the length of the journeys they made. We find them\r\nmentioned as early as the reign of King John under the name of _nuncii_\r\nor _cursores_; and payments to them form a large item in the Household\r\nand Wardrobe accounts of the King as early as these accounts exist.[1]\r\nThey travelled the whole of the journey themselves and delivered their\r\nletters personally to the people to whom they were directed. A somewhat\r\ndifferent style of postal service, a precursor of the modern method, was\r\ninaugurated by the fourth Edward. During the war with Scotland he found\r\nhimself in need of a speedier and better system of communication between\r\nthe seat of war and the seat of government. He accomplished this by\r\nplacing horses at intervals of twenty miles along the great road between\r\nEngland and Scotland. By so doing his messengers were able to take up\r\nfresh horses along the way and his despatches were carried at the rate\r\nof a hundred miles a day.[2]\r\n\r\n[1] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 21.\r\n\r\n[2] _Notes and Queries_, 1st series, iii, p. 266.\r\n\r\nFrom an early period private letters were conveyed by carriers and\r\ntravellers both within the kingdom and between it and the Continent. The\r\nPaston letters,[3] containing the correspondence of the different\r\nmembers of the Paston family, throw some light upon the manner in which\r\nletters were conveyed during the latter half of the fifteenth century.\r\nJudging from such references as we find in the letters themselves, they\r\nwere generally carried by a servant,[4] a messenger,[5] or a friend.[6]\r\nThe later letters of this series, written towards the close of the\r\nfifteenth century, show that regular messengers and carriers, who\r\ncarried letters and parcels, travelled between London and Norwich and\r\nother parts of Norfolk.[7] From the fourteenth century down, we have\r\ninstances of writs being issued to mayors, sheriffs, and bailiffs for\r\nthe apprehension and examination of travellers, who were suspected of\r\nconveying treasonable correspondence between England and the\r\nContinent.[8] For the most part these letters were carried by servants,\r\nmessengers, and merchants.[9]\r\n\r\n[3] These letters were sent principally between London and different\r\nplaces in Norfolk.\r\n\r\n[4] _The Paston Letters_, ed.

The King's \"Book of Payments\" for the year 1512 contains an\r\norder for the payment of £100 to Sir Brian for his use as Master of the\r\nPosts.[10] As the King's appointed Postmaster, he received a salary of\r\n£66 13_s._ 4_d._[11] He named the postmen, or deputy postmasters as they\r\nwere called later, and he was held responsible for the performance of\r\ntheir duties.[12] All letters carried by the royal postmen were\r\ndelivered to him, and after being sorted by him personally were carried\r\nto their destination by the court messengers.[13] The wages of the\r\npostmen varied from 1_s._ to 2_s._ a day according to the number of\r\nhorses provided, and they were paid by the Postmaster-General, who had\r\nauthority to make all payments to those regularly employed.[14] If\r\nmessages or letters were sent by special messengers, their payment\r\nentailed additional expense upon the state and the use of such\r\nmessengers, when regular postmen were available, was strongly\r\ndiscouraged.[15]\r\n\r\n[10] _L. & P. Hen. VIII_, ii, pt. 2, p. 1454.\r\n\r\n[11] _Rep. Com._ 1844, xiv, app., p. 21 (8).\r\n\r\n[12] _Ibid._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 32 (7).\r\n\r\n[13] _L. & P. Hen.

VIII_, 1535, p. 27.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his other duties Sir Brian was supposed to have a general\r\nsupervision over the horses used for the conveyance of letters and of\r\ntravellers riding on affairs of state. Of course on the regular roads\r\nthere were always horses in readiness, provided by the postmen. Where\r\nthere were no regular post roads, the townships were supposed to provide\r\nthe necessary horses, and it was part of the Postmaster-General's duties\r\nto see that the townships were kept up to the mark.[16] It was largely\r\non account of the fact that the same horses were used for conveying\r\ntravellers and mails that the systems of postal and personal\r\ncommunication were so closely interwoven as well in England as in\r\ncontinental countries.[17]\r\n\r\n[16] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 32 (7). _A. P.

These men were called the ordinary posts.[18] If, however, letters\r\nshould arrive in Dover after the ordinary post had left for London, they\r\nwere generally sent on at once by a messenger hired for the occasion\r\nonly. He was called a special post and was paid only for the work which\r\nhe actually performed.[19] Those regular posts, who carried the royal\r\nand state letters between London and the place where the Court might be,\r\nwere called \"Court Posts.\"[20] During the sovereign's tours, posts were\r\nalways stationed between him and London to carry his and the state's\r\nletters backward and forward. These were called extraordinary posts and\r\nreceived regular wages while so employed.[21] In addition there were\r\nalways messengers employed to carry important despatches to foreign\r\nsovereigns. These received no fixed wages, but were paid according to\r\nthe distance travelled and the expenses incurred on the road.[22]\r\n\r\n[18] _L. & P. Hen. VIII_, xiii, 226; _A. P.

He could not on his own responsibility\r\norder new posts to be laid. Such decisions always originated with the\r\nKing or the Council and Tuke simply executed their orders.[23] Any\r\nincrease in the wages of the posts also required the consent of the King\r\nor Council.[24]\r\n\r\n[23] _L. & P. Hen. VII_, xvi, 540; _A.P.C._ 1556-58, pp. 248, 309.\r\n\r\n[24] _A.P.C._, 1556-58, pp. 136, 188, 385. For instance, in 1557 the\r\nCouncil issued orders to increase the wages of the London-Berwick posts\r\nfrom 12_d._ to 16_d._ and eventually to 20_d._ a day; but as soon as\r\ntheir work had again become normal, their wages were reduced to the old\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century there were three ways to send letters\r\nbetween England and the Continent: by the Royal Post, the Foreigners'\r\nPost, and the Merchant Adventurers' Post, apart from such opportunities\r\nas occasional travellers and messengers offered. The Royal Posts were\r\npresumed to carry only state letters, and consequently the conveyance of\r\na large part of the private letters fell to the other two. Owing to\r\nindustrial and later to religious motives there had been a large\r\nemigration of foreigners from the Continent to England. Edward III had\r\ninduced many Flemings to leave their native country in the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century.[25] Froude says, probably with exaggeration, that in\r\n1527 there were 15,000 Flemings in London alone.[26] In the fifteenth\r\ncentury many Italian artisans came over to reside but not to settle.[27]\r\nThey were a thrifty people, who did much to place the industrial life of\r\nEngland on a better footing, and were probably more intelligent and\r\nbetter educated than the majority of the English artisans among whom\r\nthey settled. It seems therefore only natural that they should seek to\r\nestablish a better system of communication between their adopted and\r\nnative countries. Their business relations with the cloth markets of the\r\ncontinental cities made necessary a better and speedier postal system\r\nthan was afforded by the Royal Posts. In addition to this, it was only\r\nby act of grace that private letters were carried by Tuke's postmen. In\r\nthe opening year of the sixteenth century, by permission of the state,\r\nthe foreign merchants in London established a system of posts of their\r\nown between the English capital and the Continent. This was called the\r\n\"Foreign or Strangers' Post,\" and was managed by a Postmaster-General,\r\nnominated by the Italians, Spanish, and Dutch and confirmed by the\r\nCouncil.[28] These posts were used largely by the English merchants in\r\nspite of considerable dissatisfaction on account of the poor service\r\nafforded and on political grounds. Their grievances were detailed in a\r\npetition to the Privy Council. They considered it unprecedented that so\r\nimportant a service as the carriage of letters should be in the hands of\r\nmen who owed no allegiance to the King. Such a procedure was unheard of\r\nin any of the continental countries. \"What check could there be over\r\ntreasonable correspondence while the carriage of letters continued to be\r\nin the hands of foreigners and most of them Dutchmen?\" In addition they\r\nwere not treated so well as were their fellow merchants of foreign\r\nallegiance. Their letters were often retained for several days at a\r\ntime, while all others were delivered as soon as they arrived. The\r\nforeign ambassadors could not complain if a change were made, for most\r\nof their correspondence was carried on by special messengers.[29] The\r\n\"Strangers' Post\" seems to have come to an end after the Proclamation of\r\n1591 was issued, forbidding any but the Royal Posts from carrying\r\nletters to and from foreign countries.[30]\r\n\r\n[25] W.

Mr. Paget was the\r\nsleeping partner, and what little was done was by Mason.[31] They were\r\nsucceeded in 1568 by Thomas Randolph.[32] He was occasionally sent as\r\nspecial ambassador to France and during his absence Gascoyne, a former\r\ncourt post, performed his duties. From Sir Brian's death until the end\r\nof Elizabeth's reign was a period of little advance in postal matters.\r\nThe regular posts, and it is with them that our chief interest lies,\r\nappear to have fallen into disuse. The payments for special messengers\r\nare much larger than they had been during Henry's reign. In 1549, a\r\nwarrant was issued empowering Sir John Mason to pay £400 to the special\r\nmessengers used during the summer. If anything was left, he was\r\ninstructed to use it in paying arrears due the ordinary posts.[33]\r\nElizabeth is generally credited with being economical to the extreme of\r\nparsimony so far as state expenses were concerned. However this may be,\r\nshe is responsible for an order to discharge all the regular posts\r\nunless they would serve for half of their old wages.[34] The postmen did\r\nnot receive their wages at all regularly. Randolph was accused by the\r\nGovernor of Berwick of withholding all of their first year's wages, of\r\nreceiving every year thereafter a percentage of their salaries, and of\r\ndemanding certain fees from them, all for his personal use. The Governor\r\nconsidered that Randolph's extortions were largely the cause of the\r\ngeneral inefficiency in the posts,[35] but the accusation may have been\r\ndue to personal grudge. At any rate one measure of postal reform may be\r\ncredited to Randolph. In 1582, orders were issued to all the\r\nLondon-Berwick posts to the following effect. Every post on the arrival\r\nof letters to or from the Queen or Council was to fasten a label to the\r\npacket. On this label he was to write the day and hour when the packet\r\ncame into his hands and he was to make the same entry in a book kept for\r\nthe purpose. He was also to keep two or three good horses in his stable\r\nfor the speedier conveyance of such packets.[36]\r\n\r\n[31] _A. P. C._, 1542-47, p. 267; _Rep.

The office was given to him for his life and then was to go\r\nto his son for his son's life.[37] Both the Stanhopes were men of\r\naction, but they looked upon their position rather as a means of\r\nenriching themselves than as a trust for the good of the state. They\r\nproved a stumbling block to the advancement of better men and it was not\r\nfor sixty years that they were finally swept away to make room for men\r\nof greater ability. In 1621, the elder Stanhope was succeeded by his son\r\nCharles according to the terms of the original patent.[38] It had been\r\nthe custom for the Postmasters-General to demand fees and percentages\r\nfrom their appointees. So lucrative were many of their positions from\r\nthe monopoly in letting horses and the receipts from private letters\r\nthat many applicants were willing to pay for appointments as deputy\r\npostmasters. The ordinary payments when Lord Charles was at the head of\r\nthe posts amounted to 2s. in the pound as poundage and a fee of £2 from\r\neach man. These payments were considered so exorbitant that the Council\r\nordered them to be reduced.[39] One, Hutchins, entered the lists as the\r\nchampion of the postmasters. He himself was one of them and acted as\r\ntheir solicitor in the contest. Stanhope was glad to compound the case\r\nby the payment of £30. Hutchins gave the Council so much trouble that\r\nthey gave orders that \"turbulent Hutchins\" should cease to act as the\r\npostmasters' solicitor and leave them in peace.[40] His object, however,\r\nseems to have been accomplished so far as Stanhope was concerned. The\r\nstruggle with the Paymasters of the Posts was not so successful, for,\r\nsupported by a report of the Treasurer, they continued to receive their\r\nshilling in the pound.[41]\r\n\r\n[37] _Cal.

A postmaster's salary at this time was about\r\n5_s._ a day. (_Ibid._, 1623-25, p. 130.)\r\n\r\n[40] _Ibid._, 1623-25, pp. 117, 130, 153.\r\n\r\n[41] _Ibid._, 1619-23, pp. 567-68.\r\n\r\nBy a Privy Council Proclamation issued in 1603, all posts receiving a\r\ndaily fee were required to have two leather bags, lined with \"bayes\" or\r\ncotton, and the post himself was to sound a horn whenever he met any one\r\non the road or four times in every mile. The packet of letters was not\r\nto be delayed more than fifteen minutes and was to be carried at a rate\r\nof seven miles an hour in summer and five in winter. The time at which\r\nit was delivered into a post's hands and the names and addresses of the\r\npeople by whom and to whom it was sent were to be entered in a book kept\r\nfor the purpose. All posts and their servants were exempted from being\r\n\"pressed\" and from attendance at assizes, sessions, inquests, and\r\nmusters.[42]\r\n\r\n[42] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 38 (18).\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful how far the postmasters were held responsible for the\r\ndelivery of letters to the persons to whom they were addressed. This did\r\nnot become a burning question, however, until after the recognition of\r\nthe fact that the letters of private individuals should receive as good\r\ntreatment at the hands of the postmen as the letters of the state\r\nofficials. Lord Stanhope in 1618 issued an order to the Justices of the\r\nPeace in Southwark to aid the postmaster of that place in the delivery\r\nof letters within six miles.[43] This was followed two years later by a\r\ngeneral order to establish two or three foot-posts in every parish for\r\nthe conveyance of letters.[44]\r\n\r\n[43] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1611-18, p. 601.\r\n\r\n[44] Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._ 15, app., pt. 7, p. 63.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the seventeenth century, Stanhope had employed\r\na foreigner, de Quester, as one of the King's posts \"beyond seas.\" He\r\ncommended himself to the notice of his superiors by his promptitude in\r\ndealing with the foreign letters.[45] In 1619 James appointed him\r\nPostmaster-General for \"foreign parts\" and henceforth he was his own\r\nmaster.[46] This was followed four years later by a formal proclamation,\r\nconfirming to de Quester and his son the position already granted to the\r\nfather.[47] He was to have the sole monopoly of carrying foreign letters\r\nand was to appoint the necessary officials. All persons were formally\r\nprohibited from entrenching upon the privileges granted him in 1619.\r\nFrom this time until 1635, the foreign and inland posts were under\r\nseparate management and the accounts were kept separate until long after\r\nthe latter date. Stanhope was unwilling to submit to the curtailment of\r\nhis profits, which necessarily followed the appointment of de Quester.\r\nThere was much to be said for Stanhope's contention that the patent of\r\n1623 was illegal for, ever since there had been a Postmaster-General,\r\nhis duties had extended to the foreign as well as to the inland office.\r\nThe question was referred to a committee, composed of the Lord\r\nChamberlain, one of the Secretaries of State and the Attorney-General,\r\nwho decided that Stanhope's patent extended only to the inland\r\noffice.[48] The whole question was finally brought before the Court of\r\nKing's Bench, which decided the case in favour of Stanhope.[49] This was\r\nin 1625, but de Quester seems to have paid no attention to the decision\r\nfor it is certain that he continued to act as Foreign Postmaster until\r\n1629[50] and in 1632 he resigned his patent to Frizell and Witherings.\r\nIt can be imagined what must have been the chaotic condition of the\r\nforeign post while this struggle was going on. The Merchant Adventurers\r\nestablished posts of their own between London and the Continent under\r\nBillingsley. The Council issued the most perplexing orders. First they\r\nforbade Billingsley from having anything to do with foreign letters.[51]\r\nThen they decided that the Adventurers might establish posts of their\r\nown and choose a Postmaster.[52] Then they extended the same privilege\r\nto all merchants. Next this was withdrawn and the Adventurers were\r\nallowed to send letters only to Antwerp, Delft and Hamburg or wherever\r\nthe staple of cloth might be.[53] These orders do not seem to have been\r\npassed in full council for, in 1628, Secretary Coke in writing to\r\nSecretary Conway said that \"Billingsley, a broker by trade, strives to\r\ndraw over to the merchants that power over foreign letters which in all\r\nstates is a branch of royal authority. The merchant's purse has swayed\r\nmuch in other matters but he has never heard that it encroached upon the\r\nKing's prerogative until now.\" He adds \"I confess it troubleth me to see\r\nthe audacity of men in these times and especially that Billingsley.\" He\r\nenclosed a copy of an order \"made at a full Council and under the Broad\r\nSeal,\" which in effect was a supersedeas of the place which de Quester\r\nenjoyed.[54] When de Quester resigned in favour of Frizell and\r\nWitherings, the resignation and new appointments were confirmed by the\r\nKing.[55] Of these men Witherings was far the abler. He had a plan in\r\nview, which was eventually to place the foreign and inland systems on a\r\nbasis unchanged until the time of penny postage. In the meantime he had\r\nto overcome the prejudices of the King and get rid of Frizell. In order\r\nto raise money for the promotion of his plan, Witherings mortgaged his\r\nplace. Capital was obtained from the Earl of Arundel and others through\r\nJohn Hall, who held the mortgage. The King heard of this and ordered\r\nthe office to be sequestered to his old servant de Quester and\r\ncommanded Hall to make over his interest to the same person.[56] There\r\nwere now three claimants for the place, Frizell, Witherings, and de\r\nQuester. Frizell rushed off to Court, where he offered to pay off his\r\npart of the mortgage and asked to have sole charge of the Foreign Post.\r\n\"Witherings,\" he said, \"proposes to take charge of all packets of State\r\nif he may have the office, but being a home-bred shopkeeper, without\r\nlanguages, tainted of delinquency and in dislike with the foreign\r\ncorrespondents, he is no fit person to carry a trust of such secrecy and\r\nimportance.\"[57] Coke knew better than this, however, and through his\r\ninfluence Witherings, who had in the meantime paid off the mortgage and\r\nsatisfied Frizell's interest, was made sole Postmaster-General for\r\nForeign Parts.[58]\r\n\r\n[45] _Cal.

It had been established as a service for the royal\r\nhousehold and continued as an official necessity. The letters of private\r\nindividuals had been carried by its messengers but the state had derived\r\nno revenue for their conveyance. The convenient activity of other\r\nagencies for the carriage of private letters was not only tolerated but\r\nofficially recognized. The change to a revenue-paying basis tended\r\nnaturally to emphasize the monopolistic character of the government\r\nservice.[59]\r\n\r\n[59] See chapter IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE POSTAL ESTABLISHMENT A SOURCE OF REVENUE TO THE STATE\r\n\r\n1633-1711\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time there had been dissatisfaction with the services rendered\r\nby the inland posts. It was said that letters would arrive sooner from\r\nSpain and Italy than from remote parts of the kingdom of England.[60]\r\nThe only alternative was to send them by express and this was not only\r\nexpensive but was not looked upon with favour by the Postmaster-General.\r\nThe five great roads from London to Edinburgh, Holyhead, Bristol,\r\nPlymouth, and Dover were in operation. From the Edinburgh Road there\r\nwere branches to York and Carlisle, from the Dover Road to Margate,\r\nGravesend, and Sandwich, and from the Plymouth Road to Falmouth, but the\r\nposts were slow and the rates for private letters uncertain.[61] In\r\n1633, a project was advanced for the new arrangement of the Post Office.\r\nThe plan was not entirely theoretical, for an attempt was made to show\r\nthat it would prove a financial success. There were about 512 market\r\ntowns in England. It was considered that each of these would send 50\r\nletters a week to London and as many answers would be returned. At 4_d._\r\na day for each letter, this would amount to £426 a week. The charge for\r\nconveyance was estimated at £37 a week, leaving a weekly profit of £389,\r\nfrom which £1500 a year for the conveyance of state letters and\r\ndespatches must be deducted. Letters on the northern road were to pay\r\n2_d._ for a single and 4_d._ for a double letter, to Yorkshire and\r\nNorthumberland 3_d._, and to Scotland 8_d._ a letter. The postmasters in\r\nthe country were not to take any charge for a letter except one penny\r\nfor carriage to the next market town.[62] It is probable that this\r\nproject originated with Witherings. At any rate it resembles closely the\r\nplan which was introduced by him two years later. He had already\r\nreformed the foreign post by appointing \"stafetti\" from London to Dover\r\nand through France and they had proved so efficient as to disarm the\r\nopposition even of the London merchants. His name is without doubt the\r\nmost distinguished in the annals of the British Post Office. Convinced\r\nthat the carriage of private letters must be placed upon a secure\r\nfooting, he laid the foundation for the system of postal rates and\r\nregulations, which continued to the time of national penny postage. He\r\nintroduced the first legal provision for the carriage of private letters\r\nat fixed rates, greatly increased the speed of the posts, and above all\r\nmade the Post Office a financial success. In order to do this he saw\r\nthat the proceeds from private letters must go to the state and not to\r\nthe deputy postmasters.\r\n\r\n[60] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1580-1625, p. 360.\r\n\r\n[61] _Ibid._, 1580-1625, p. 630.\r\n\r\n[62] _Ibid._, 1625-26, p. 366. A single letter consisted of one sheet of\r\npaper, a double letter of two, and a triple letter of three sheets.\r\n\r\nHis plan was entitled \"A proposition for settling of Stafetti or pacquet\r\nposts betwixt London and all parts of His Majesty's Dominions. The\r\nprofits to go to pay the postmasters, who now are paid by His Majesty at\r\na cost of £3400 per annum.\" A general office or counting house was to be\r\nestablished in London for the reception of all letters coming to or\r\nleaving the capital. Letters leaving London on each of the great roads\r\nwere to be enclosed in a leather \"portmantle\" and left at the post-towns\r\non the way. Letters for any of the towns off the great roads were to be\r\nplaced in smaller leather bags to be carried in the large portmantle.\r\nThese leather bags were to be left at the post-towns nearest the country\r\ntowns to which they were directed. They were then to be carried to their\r\ndestination by foot-posts to a distance of six or eight miles and for\r\neach letter these foot-posts were to charge 2d., the same price that was\r\ncharged by the country carriers. At the same time that the foot-posts\r\ndelivered their letters, they were to collect letters to be sent to\r\nLondon and carry them back to the post-town from which they had started\r\nand there meet the portmantle on its way back from Edinburgh or Bristol\r\nor wherever the terminus of the road might be. The speed of the posts\r\nwas to be at least 120 miles in twenty-four hours and they were to\r\ntravel day and night. He concludes his proposition by saying that no\r\nharm would result to Stanhope by his plan \"for neither Lord Stanhope nor\r\nanie other, that ever enjoyed the Postmaster's place of England, had\r\nany benefit of the carrying and re-carrying of the subjects'\r\nletters.\"[63]\r\n\r\n[63] _Rep. Com._, xiv, app., p. 55 (35). _Cal. S. P. D._, 1635, p. 166.\r\nLetters were to be carried to and from important places at some distance\r\nfrom the main roads by post-horses. See _Cal. S. P. D._, above.\r\n\r\nThe question now was, Who was to see that these reforms were carried\r\nout? Stanhope was not the man for so important and revolutionary an\r\nundertaking. Witherings alone, the author of the proposition, should\r\ncarry it into effect. Sir John Coke made no mistake in constituting\r\nhimself the friend of the postal reformer. Witherings was already\r\nForeign Postmaster-General and in 1635 he was charged with the\r\nreformation of the inland office on the basis of his projected scheme.\r\nIn 1637 the inland and foreign offices were again united when he was\r\nmade Foreign and Inland Postmaster-General.[64] His experiment was tried\r\non the Northern Road first and was exceedingly successful. Letters were\r\nsent to Edinburgh and answers returned in six days. On the Northern Road\r\nbye-posts were established to Lincoln, Hull and other places.[65] Orders\r\nwere given to extend the same arrangement to the other great roads, and\r\nby 1636 his reform was in full and profitable operation.\r\n\r\n[64] _Rep. Com._, xiv, p. 5; app., p. 57 (36); _Cal. S. P. D._, 1635-36,\r\np. 32.\r\n\r\n[65] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1635, p. 299.\r\n\r\nWitherings still continued to sell the positions of the postmasters, if\r\nwe are to trust the complaints of non-successful applicants. One man\r\nsaid that he offered £100 for a position but Witherings sold it to\r\nanother for £40.[66] The Postmaster at Ferrybridge asserted that he had\r\npaid Stanhope £200 and Witherings £35 and yet now fears that he will be\r\nousted. Complaints of a reduction in wages were also made, and this was\r\na serious matter, since the postmasters no longer obtained anything from\r\nprivate letters.[67] The old complaint, however, of failure to pay wages\r\nat all is not heard under Witherings' administration. He was punctual in\r\nhis payments and held his employees to equally rigid account. Their\r\narrears were not excused.[68] An absentee postmaster, who hired\r\ndeputies to perform his duties, was dismissed.[69] His ambition to\r\nestablish a self-supporting postal system demanded rigid economy and\r\nstrict administration, and with the then prevailing laxity of\r\nadministrative methods, this was no mean achievement. From one\r\noccasional practice of the Post Office, that of tampering with private\r\nletters, he cannot perhaps wholly be absolved. It is hinted that he may\r\nhave been guilty of opening letters, but the suggestion follows that\r\nthis may have happened before they reached England, for the letters so\r\nopened were from abroad.[70]\r\n\r\n[66] _Ibid._, 1637, p. 527; _ibid._, 1636-37, p. 524.\r\n\r\n[67] _Ibid._, 1638-39, p. 119.\r\n\r\n[68] _Ibid._, 1637-38, pp. 52, 53, 394.\r\n\r\n[69] _Cal.

(_Ibid._, 1639, p. 279.)\r\n\r\nIn June of 1637, Coke and Windebank, the two Secretaries of State, were\r\nappointed Postmasters-General for their lives. The surviving one was to\r\nsurrender his office to the King, who would then grant it to the\r\nSecretaries for the time being.[71] It does not appear that Witherings\r\nwas altogether dismissed from the service, for his name continued to\r\nappear in connection with postal affairs.[72] Windebank later urged as\r\nreasons for the withdrawal of Witherings' patent, that he was not a\r\nsworn officer, that there was a suspicion that his patent had been\r\nobtained surreptitiously, and that the continental postmasters disdained\r\nto correspond with a man of his low birth. He concludes by saying that\r\nsomething may be given him, but that he is said to be worth £800 a year\r\nin land and to have enriched himself from his position.[73] At the time\r\nof his removal, in June, 1637, the London merchants petitioned for his\r\ncontinuance in office, as he had always given them satisfaction. When\r\nthey heard who had been appointed in his stead, like loyal and fearful\r\nsubjects, they hastened to add that they thought someone else was trying\r\nfor the position but they had no doubt that it would be managed best by\r\nthe Secretaries.[74] If they thought so they were mistaken, for the\r\ncommander of the English army against Scotland found that his letters\r\nwere opened,[75] the Lord High Admiral complained that his were\r\ndelayed,[76] and Windebank promised an unknown correspondent that the\r\ndelay in his letters should be seen to at once and Witherings was the\r\nagent chosen for the investigation.[77] This, however, was not the\r\nworst, for only a month after Witherings had been degraded, orders were\r\nissued to the postmasters that no packets or letters were to be sent by\r\npost but such as should be directed \"For His Majesty's Special Affairs\"\r\nand were subscribed by certain officials connected with the\r\nGovernment.[78] It is fair to add that this check on private\r\ncorrespondence may have been a protective measure induced by the\r\nunsettled state of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[71] _Ibid._, 1637, p. 255.\r\n\r\n[72] _Ibid._, 1639, p. 279; _Rep.

No reasons were given except that information had been\r\nreceived \"of divers abuses and misdemeanours committed by Thomas\r\nWitherings.\"[79] Stanhope, who had resigned his patent in 1637, now came\r\nforward claiming that his resignation had been unfairly obtained by the\r\nCouncil, and at the same time he presented his bill for £1266, the\r\narrears in his salary for nineteen years.[80] In reply to his demand it\r\nwas said that shortly before he resigned he had assigned his rights in\r\nthe Post Office to the Porters, father and son. The Attorney-General\r\ngave his opinion that whatever rights Stanhope and the Porters had, they\r\ncertainly had no claim to the proceeds from the carriage of private\r\nletters.[81] Stanhope had offered to enter an appearance in a suit\r\nbrought against him by the Porters but now he refused to do so.[82]\r\nWindebank was also looking out for money due to him while Coke and he\r\nwere Postmasters-General.[83] The state had indeed entered upon\r\ntroublous times and it was every man for himself before it was too late.\r\n\r\n[79] _Rep.

They had ordered in 1640\r\n\"that a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Grievances should be made a\r\nHouse Committee to consider abuses in the inland posts, to take into\r\nconsideration the rates for letters and packets together with the abuses\r\nof Witherings and the rest of the postmasters.\"[84] As soon as\r\nWitherings was finally dismissed, the Commons took him up and\r\nresolutions were passed that the sequestration was illegal and ought to\r\nbe repealed, that the proclamation for ousting him from his position\r\nought not to be put into execution, and that he ought to be restored to\r\nhis old position and be paid the mean profits which had been received\r\nsince his nominal dismissal.[85] Protected by the authority of the House\r\nof Commons, Witherings continued to act as Postmaster-General.[86]\r\nWindebank, in Paris, was trying to collect evidence against him through\r\nFrizell, who, he said, had been forced out of his position by Witherings\r\nand Coke.[87] Coke himself was in disgrace and could do nothing.\r\nParliament was now supreme. Witherings was ordered to send to a\r\nCommittee of the Lords, acting with Sir Henry Vane, all letters coming\r\ninto or going out of the kingdom for examination and search. Frequent\r\norders to the same effect followed during the turbulent summer and\r\nautumn of 1641.[88] Among other letters opened were those of the\r\nVenetian Ambassador in England. He was so indignant that a Committee of\r\nthe Lords was sent to him to ask his pardon.[89] The two Houses of\r\nParliament united in condemning the sequestration to Burlamachi, but\r\nWitherings, who had become tired of the strife, assigned his position to\r\nthe Earl of Warwick.[90] The Earl was supported by both Houses, but the\r\nLower House played a double part, for, while openly supporting Warwick,\r\nthey now secretly favoured Burlamachi, who had found an influential\r\nfriend in Edmund Prideaux, former chairman of the committee appointed to\r\ninvestigate the condition of the posts and later Attorney-General under\r\nthe Commonwealth.[91] Prideaux was a strong Parliamentarian, but was\r\ndistrusted even by his own friends. But for the time being, as the\r\nrepresentative of the Commons, he was supported by them. The messenger\r\nof the Upper House made oath that he had delivered the Commons'\r\nresolution to Burlamachi, commanding him to hand over the Inland Letter\r\nOffice to Warwick, but James Hicks had presented an order at the place\r\nappointed by Warwick for receiving letters, to deliver all letters to\r\nPrideaux. Burlamachi on being summoned before the Lords for contempt\r\nsaid that Prideaux had hired his house and now had charge of the mails.\r\nThe fight went merrily on. Two servants of Warwick seized the Holyhead\r\nletters from Hicks, but were in turn stopped by five troopers, agents of\r\nPrideaux, who took the letters from them by order of the House of\r\nCommons. Prideaux also seized the Chester and Plymouth letters, one of\r\nhis servants calling out \"that an order of the House of Commons ought to\r\nbe obeyed before an order of the House of Lords.\"[92] Hicks, who had\r\nbeen arrested by order of the Lords, was liberated by the Commons as a\r\nservant of a member of Parliament.[93] As between Lords and Commons,\r\nthere could be no doubt as to which side would carry the day, and by the\r\nend of 1642 the Lower House was triumphant all along the line.\r\nUnderstanding that discretion was the better part of valour, the Lords\r\nfreed Burlamachi and dropped the contest. Warwick now petitioned the\r\nLords again, setting forth that he was the legal successor and assignee\r\nof Witherings. Stanhope put in a counter-petition to the effect that\r\nWitherings never had any right to the position which Warwick now\r\nclaimed. The House of Lords felt its own weakness too much to interfere\r\ndirectly, but ordered the whole matter to trial.[94] Besides Stanhope\r\nand Warwick, the following put in claims before the Council of State:\r\nHenry Robinson, through the Porters, to whom Stanhope had assigned; Sir\r\nDavid Watkins in trust for Thomas Witherings, Jr., for the foreign\r\noffice; Moore and Jessop through Watkins and Walter Warde. Billingsley\r\nalso, the old Postmaster of the Merchant Adventurers, made a claim for\r\nthe foreign office.[95]\r\n\r\n[84] _Jo. H. C._, 1640-42, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[85] _Cal. S. P.

In\r\n1643 the Royal Court was moved to Oxford. The Secretaries of State\r\nacting as Postmasters-General sent James Hicks, the quondam servant of\r\nPrideaux, to collect arrears from the postmasters due to the Letter\r\nOffice. In addition to collecting the money due, he was to require all\r\npostmasters on the road to Coventry to convey to and from the Court all\r\nletters and packets on His Majesty's service, to establish new stages,\r\nto forward the names of those willing to supply horses and guides, and\r\nto report those postmasters who were disobedient or disloyal.[96] During\r\nthe most desperate period of the royal cause Hicks acted as special\r\nmessenger for the King, and apparently had some exciting experiences in\r\ncarrying the letters of his royal master. He lived to enjoy his reward\r\nwhen the second Charles had come to his own. Parliament, in the\r\nmeantime, was establishing its control over the posts and reorganizing\r\nthe service. In the early period of Parliamentary government, postal\r\naffairs were as a rule looked after by what was known as the \"Committee\r\nof Both Kingdoms,\" and the orders which it issued were necessarily based\r\nupon political conditions. Later the Postmaster-General acted under the\r\nCouncil of State or under Cromwell himself. In 1644 the House of Commons\r\nissued an order that protection should be granted to the postmasters\r\nbetween London and Hull, to their servants, horses and goods.[97] The\r\nfact that it was necessary to re-settle posts on the old established\r\nLondon-Berwick road shows how demoralized conditions had been during the\r\nconflict.[98] Many of the loyal postmasters were dismissed. Their\r\nlukewarm conduct in supplying the messengers of the Commonwealth with\r\nhorses produced a reprimand from the Committee and a sharp warning from\r\nPrideaux.[99] Posts were settled from London to Lyme Regis for better\r\ncommunication with the southwestern counties. In 1644 Edmund Prideaux\r\nwas formally appointed Postmaster-General.[100] He was allowed to use as\r\nhis office part of the building occupied by the Committee of Accounts,\r\nformerly the house of a London alderman.[101] As long as the war\r\ncontinued it was necessary that a close watch should be kept over\r\nletters passing by post. Many of the new postmasters were military men\r\nand in addition others were appointed in each town under the heading of\r\n\"persons to give intelligence.\"[102] With the return of normal\r\nconditions after 1649 Prideaux was ordered by the Council of State to\r\nmake arrangements for establishing posts all over England as in the\r\npeaceful days before the war.[103] His report of the same year to the\r\nCouncil of State indicates the successful fulfilment of his\r\ninstructions. He said that he had established a weekly conveyance of\r\nletters to all parts of the Commonwealth and that with the receipts from\r\nprivate letters he had paid all the postmasters except those on the\r\nDover road.[104]\r\n\r\n[96] _Cal.

When this was done, it was by order of the Council of State,\r\nwhich appointed certain officials to go through the correspondence.[105]\r\nSir Kenelm Digby, writing to Lord Conway from Calais, asks him to direct\r\nhis letters to that place, where they would find him, \"if no curious\r\noverseer of the packets at the post break them open for the\r\nsuperscription's sake.\"[106] The Commonwealth did openly and is\r\nconsequently blamed for what had been done more or less secretly by the\r\nRoyal Government.\r\n\r\n[105] _Ibid._, 1648-51, p. 126; _Cal. S. P. D._, 1649-50, pp. 56, 533,\r\n535, 541; 1650, pp. 7, 223; 1651-52, p. 216.\r\n\r\n[106] _Ibid._, 1649-50, p. 381.\r\n\r\nIn 1651 the first proposal for farming the Post Office was submitted to\r\nthe Council of State. The Council reported the question to Parliament\r\nbut there is no evidence as to their attitude on the question at that\r\ntime.[107] The next year Parliament ordered that the question of\r\nmanagement, whether by contract or otherwise, should be re-committed to\r\nthe Council,[108] and in 1653 it was decided that it would be better to\r\nlet the posts out to farm. Prideaux had been quietly dropped by the\r\nCouncil after making, as it was reported, a large fortune. When we\r\nremember that under his management there was an annual deficit of £600\r\nbesides the expenses of the Dover road and that in 1653 there was a net\r\nrevenue of £10,000, it seems probable that there is some truth in the\r\nreport. The conditions upon which the Post Office was farmed, were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nThe farmers must be men of stability and good credit and must be\r\nselected from those contracting. Official letters and letters from and\r\nto members of Parliament must be carried free. All postage rates must be\r\nfixed by the Council and not changed without its consent. Finally all\r\npostmasters should be approved by the Council and Lord Protector.[109]\r\n\r\n[107] _Ibid._, 1651-52.\r\n\r\n[108] _Ibid._, 1651-59, p. 192.\r\n\r\n[109] _Cal. S. P.

The following is a list of the\r\ncontractors, with the yearly amounts offered by each:\r\n\r\n  Ben Andrews for Inland Office     £3600\r\n  Ben Andrews for Foreign Office     3500\r\n  Henry Robinson for both offices    8041\r\n  Ben Andrews for both offices       9100\r\n  John Goldsmith for both offices    8500\r\n  Ralph Kendall for both offices    10103\r\n  John Manley, with good security    8259\r\n  Rich.

D._, 1652-53, p. 450.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Commonwealth in letting the posts out to farm had much\r\nin its favour. The evil usually resulting from farming is the temptation\r\nand the opportunity it offers for extortion from the people. But in the\r\ncase of the posts no oppression was possible, for the farmer was limited\r\nin his charge to the rate fixed by the Government. More than this,\r\nprivate control over the post office business afforded what was most\r\nneeded at the time, greater economy and stricter supervision over the\r\ndeputy postmasters. It was upon the deputy postmasters alone that the\r\nfarming system might exercise undue pressure, but from them there was no\r\ncomplaint of the withholding or reduction of wages until after\r\nCromwell's death.[110]\r\n\r\n[110] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1658-59, p. 371.\r\n\r\nJohn Manley was appointed \"Farmer of the Posts\" for two years at a\r\nyearly rent of £10,000. There were at least four higher tenders than\r\nhis, and Manley contracted only for £8259. It was hinted that Manley and\r\nthe Council had come to a private agreement concerning the rent to be\r\npaid.[111] In his orders to the postmasters, Manley requested them to\r\ntake particular care of government packets and to see that no one was\r\nallowed to ride in post unless by special warrant. All letters should be\r\ncounted by them and the number certified in London. They were to keep a\r\nsharp eye upon people, especially travellers, and report any discontent\r\nor disaffection.[112] In 1654 Manley's title of Postmaster-General was\r\nconfirmed by act of Parliament, the first act dealing directly with\r\npostal affairs.[113] He was unsuccessful in having his franchise\r\nextended beyond the original two years, and by order of the Council of\r\nState the management of the Posts was entrusted to Mr. Thurloe,\r\nSecretary of State, for £10,000 a year, the same amount which Manley had\r\npaid.[114]\r\n\r\n[111] _Ibid._, 1653-54, pp. 27, 328.\r\n\r\n[112] _Cal.

D._, 1655,\r\np. 138.\r\n\r\nShortly after Thurloe had been appointed Postmaster-General, general\r\norders were issued by Cromwell to all the postmasters. He forbade them\r\nto send by express any letters or packets except those sent by certain\r\nofficials on affairs of state, all others to await the regular time for\r\nthe departure of the mails. The old regulations for providing mail-bags,\r\nregistration of the time of reception, and the like were repeated. The\r\nnumber of mails to and from London was increased from one to three a\r\nweek each way, and to ensure higher speed, each postmaster was to\r\nprovide a horse ready saddled and was not to detain the mail longer than\r\nhalf an hour under any consideration. He was ordered to deliver all\r\nletters in the country at or near his stage and was to collect the\r\npostage marked on the letter unless it was postpaid. The money so\r\ncollected was to be returned to London every three months.[115]\r\n\r\n[115] _Ibid._, 1655, pp. 285 f.\r\n\r\nIn 1657 the first act of Parliament was passed which fixed rates for the\r\nconveyance of letters and established the system for the British\r\nIslands. The preamble stated: \"That whereas it hath been found by\r\nexperience that the writing and settling of one General Post Office ...\r\nis the best means not only to maintain certain intercourse of trade and\r\ncommerce betwixt all the said places to the great benefit of the people\r\nof these nations, but also to convey the public despatches and to\r\ndiscover and prevent many dangerous and wicked designs, which have been\r\nand are daily continued against the peace and welfare of this\r\nCommonwealth,\" it is enacted that there shall be one General Post Office\r\ncalled the Post Office of England, and one Postmaster-General nominated\r\nand appointed by the Protector for life or for a term of years not\r\nexceeding eleven.[116] In accordance with the terms of this act, Thurloe\r\nwas appointed by Cromwell and continued to act as Postmaster-General\r\nuntil the downfall of the Commonwealth.[117]\r\n\r\n[116] Scobell, _Collect._, pp. 511-13 (1656, c. 30).\r\n\r\n[117] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1657-58, p. 81. In January of 1660 the Council\r\ntook the Post Office under its own control for a short time. _Jo. H.\r\nC._, 1651-59, p. 81; _Cal. S. P. D._, 1659-60, p. 303.\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration most of the old claimants to the Post Office came\r\nto the front again. Stanhope besieged King and Parliament for\r\nrestoration to his old place. He seems to have received some\r\ncompensation, which he deserved for his pertinacity if for nothing else.\r\nThe Porters were up in arms at once, for he had promised them to come to\r\nno agreement until they were satisfied.[118] The two daughters of\r\nBurlamachi pleaded for some mark of favour, on the ground that their\r\nfather had ruined himself for the late King. Frizell was still very much\r\nalive, and a nephew of Witherings carried on the family feud.[119] In\r\nthe meantime James Hicks was employed by the Secretary of State to\r\nascertain how many of the old deputy postmasters were still eligible for\r\npositions. He reported that many of them were dead and that many of\r\nthose who were applying for positions had been enemies of the King. For\r\nthe time being it was decided that the present officials should remain\r\nin office until a settlement should be made.[120]\r\n\r\n[118] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1660-61, p. 178; Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._ 7, p.\r\n109.\r\n\r\n[119] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1660-61, pp. 93-100, 301.\r\n\r\n[120] _Ibid._, 1660-61, pp. 37, 82.\r\n\r\nHenry Bishop was appointed by royal patent Postmaster-General of England\r\nfor seven years at a rent of £21,500 a year. The King agreed to persuade\r\nParliament to pass an act[121] settling the rates and terms under which\r\nBishop was to exercise his duties. For the time being he was to charge\r\nthe same rates as those in the \"pretended Act of 1657,\" to defray all\r\npostal expenses and to carry free all public letters and letters of\r\nmembers of Parliament during the present session. He agreed also to\r\nallow the Secretaries to examine letters and not to change old routes or\r\nset up new without their consent. He was to dismiss all officials whom\r\nthey should object to on reasonable grounds. If his income should be\r\nlessened by war or plague or if this grant should prove ineffectual, the\r\nSecretaries agreed to allow such abatement in his farm as should seem\r\nreasonable to them.[122] Bishop's régime does not seem to have been\r\npopular with the postmasters, for a petition in behalf of 300 of them,\r\nrepresenting themselves to be \"all the postmasters in England, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland,\" was presented to Parliament in protest against the\r\nPostmaster-General's actions. They describe how Cromwell had let the\r\nPost Office out to farm. They credit him with respecting their rights\r\nand paying their wages. Lately, however, Bishop had been appointed\r\nfarmer, and unless they submitted to his orders, they were dismissed at\r\nonce. He had decreased their wages by more than one half, made them pay\r\nfor their places again, and demanded bonds from them that they should\r\nnot disclose any of these things.[123]\r\n\r\n[121] The act of 1660 (12 Ch. II, c. 35) passed in pursuance of this\r\nagreement added nothing of importance to the act of 1657, except on the\r\nquestion of rates. See below, chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n[122] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., pp. 75, 76 (52, 53).\r\n\r\n[123] Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._, 7, p. 140.\r\n\r\nIn 1633, Bishop resigned his grant to Daniel O'Neale for £8000. O'Neale\r\noffered £2000 and, in addition, promised £1000 a year, during the lease,\r\nto Bennet, Secretary of State, if he would have the assignment\r\nconfirmed. He explained that this would not injure the Duke of York's\r\ninterest, who could expect no increase until the expiration of the\r\noriginal contract, which still had four years and a quarter to run.[124]\r\nThis refers to an act of Parliament which had just been passed, settling\r\nthe £21,500 post revenue upon the Duke of York and his male heirs,[125]\r\nwith the exception of some £5000 which had been assigned by the King to\r\nhis mistresses and favourites. O'Neale having died before his lease\r\nexpired, his wife, the Countess of Chesterfield, performed his duties\r\nuntil 1667.[126]\r\n\r\n[124] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1663-64, p. 122; _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app.,\r\npp. 86, 91 (60, 64).\r\n\r\n[125] _Ibid._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 91 (64). Confirmed in 1685 (Hist.\r\nMSS. Com., _Rep._, 11, app., 2, p. 315; 1 Jas. ii, c. 12).\r\n\r\n[126] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1664-65, p. 376; 1666-67, p. 567.\r\n\r\nAccording to the grant made to O'Neale in 1663 no postmaster nor any\r\nother person except the one to whom it was directed or returned was to\r\nopen any letter unless ordered so to do by an express warrant from one\r\nof the Secretaries of State. If any letter was overcharged, the excess\r\nwas to be returned to the person to whom it was directed. Nothing was\r\nsaid about letters which were lost or stolen in the post. A certain John\r\nPawlett complained that of sixteen letters which he had posted not one\r\nwas ever delivered in London although the postage was prepaid.[127]\r\nLetters not prepaid were stamped with the postage due in the London\r\nOffice when they were sent from London. Letters sent to London were\r\ncharged by the receiving postmaster in the country and the charge\r\nverified at the London Office. An account was kept there of the amounts\r\ndue and the postmasters were debited with them, less the sum for letters\r\nnot delivered, which had also to be returned for verification.[128] All\r\nthis meant losses to the postal revenue, but compulsory prepayment would\r\nhave been impracticable at the time. The postmasters had nothing to gain\r\nby retaining letters not prepaid, but by neglecting to forward prepaid\r\nletters, they could keep the whole of the postage, for stamps were\r\nunknown. An incentive to the delivery of letters was provided by the\r\npenny payment which it was customary to give the postmasters for each\r\nletter delivered, over and above the regular postage. The postmasters\r\nwere required to remit the postage collected to London every month and\r\ngive bonds for the performance of their duties.[129]\r\n\r\n[127] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1664-65, p. 457. Although letters might be\r\nprepaid, it was not compulsory that they should be, and the vast\r\nmajority were not.\r\n\r\n[128] Joyce, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[129] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1667, p. 80.\r\n\r\nThe postal service was very much demoralized by the plague in 1665 and\r\n1666 and the great fire which followed. Hicks, the clerk, said that the\r\ngains during this time would be very small. To prevent contagion the\r\nbuilding was so \"fumed\" that they could hardly see each other.[130] The\r\nletters were aired over vinegar or in front of large fires and Hicks\r\nremarks that had the pestilence been carried by letters they would have\r\nbeen dead long ago. While the plague was still dangerous, the King's\r\nletters were not allowed to pass through London.[131] After the fire\r\nthe headquarters of the Post-Office in London were removed to Gresham\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n[130] _Ibid._, 1664-65, p. 51.\r\n\r\n[131] Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._, 12, app., pt. 7, pp. 14, 93; _Cal. S. P.\r\nD._, 1665-66, p. 14. _Cal. S. P. D. Add._, 1600-70, p. 713.\r\n\r\nWhen O'Neale's lease had expired in 1667, Lord Arlington, Secretary of\r\nState, was appointed Postmaster-General.[132] The real head was Sir John\r\nBennet, with whom Hicks was entirely out of sympathy. He accused Bennet\r\nof \"scurviness\" and condemned the changes initiated by him. These\r\nchanges were in the shape of reductions in wages. The postmasters'\r\nsalaries were to be reduced from £40 to £20 a year. In the London\r\nOffice, the wages of the carriers and porters were also to be\r\nreduced.[133]\r\n\r\n[132] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1665-66, p. 573.\r\n\r\n[133] _Ibid._, 1667, p. 260.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the seventeenth century there were forty-nine men\r\nemployed in the Inland Department of the Post Office in London. The\r\nPostmaster-General, or Controller as he was sometimes called, was\r\nnominally responsible for the whole management although the accountant\r\nand treasurer were more or less independent. Then there were eight\r\nclerks of the roads. They had charge of the mails coming and going on\r\nthe six great roads to Holyhead, Bristol, Plymouth, Edinburgh, Yarmouth,\r\nand Dover. The old veteran Hicks had been at their head until his\r\nresignation in 1670. The General Post Office building was in Lombard\r\nStreet.[134] Letters might be posted there or at the receiving stations\r\nat Westminster, Charing Cross, Pall Mall, Covent Garden, and the Inns of\r\nCourt. From these stations, letters were despatched to the General\r\nOffice twice on mail nights. For this work thirty-two letter carriers\r\nwere employed, but they did not deliver letters as their namesakes now\r\ndo. The mails left London for all parts of the country on Tuesday,\r\nThursday, and Saturday late at night or early the next morning. On these\r\ndays all officials had to attend at 6 P.M. and were generally at work\r\nall night. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday when the mails arrived from\r\nall parts of England they had to be on hand at 4 or 5 A.M. The postage\r\nto be paid was stamped on the letters by the clerks of the roads. In\r\naddition three sorters and three window-men were employed. The\r\nwindow-men were the officials who stood at the window to receive the\r\nletters handed in and to collect postage when it was prepaid. Then\r\nthere were an alphabet-man, who posted the names of merchants for whom\r\nletters had arrived, a sorter of paid letters, and a clerk of undertaxed\r\nletters.[135] In the Foreign Office, there were a controller, two\r\nsorters, an alphabet-man, and eight letter receivers, of whom two were\r\nwomen. In addition the Foreign Office had a rebate man who saw that\r\novercharged letters were corrected. Both offices seem to have shared the\r\ncarriers in common.[136]\r\n\r\n[134] Stow, _London_, bk. ii, p. 163.\r\n\r\n[135] _Notes and Queries_, series 9, i, p. 122; Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._,\r\n15, app., pt. 2, p. 19; _Cal. S. P. D._, 1670, p. 578.\r\n\r\n[136] Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._, 15, app., pt. 2, p. 19.\r\n\r\nBefore 1680 there was no post between one part of London and another. A\r\nLondoner having a letter for delivery had either to take it himself or\r\nsend it by a special messenger. The houses were not numbered and were\r\ngenerally recognized by the signs they bore or their nearness to some\r\npublic building. Such was the condition in the metropolis when William\r\nDockwra organized his London Penny Post. On the first of April, 1680,\r\nLondon found itself in possession of a postal system which in some\r\nrespects was superior to that of to-day. In the Penny Post Office as so\r\nestablished there were employed a controller, an accountant, a receiver,\r\nthirteen clerks in the six offices, and about a hundred messengers to\r\ncollect and deliver letters. The six offices were:--\r\n\r\n  The General Office in Star Court, Cornhill;\r\n  St. Paul's Office in Queen's Head Alley, Newgate Street;\r\n  Temple Office in Colchester Rents in Chancery Lane;\r\n  Westminster Office, St. Martin's Lane;\r\n  Southwark Office near St. Mary Overy's Church;\r\n  Hermitage Office in Swedeland Court, East Smithfield.\r\n\r\nThere were in all about 179 places in London where letters might be\r\nposted. Shops and coffee-houses were used for this purpose in addition\r\nto the six offices, and in almost every street a table might be seen at\r\nsome door or shop-window bearing in large letters the sign \"Penny Post\r\nLetters and Parcels are taken in here.\" From these places letters were\r\ncollected every hour and taken to the six main receiving-houses. There\r\nthey were sorted and stamped by the thirteen clerks. The same messengers\r\ncarried them from the receiving-houses to the people to whom they were\r\naddressed. There were four deliveries a day to most parts of the city\r\nand six or eight to the business centres.\r\n\r\nThe postage fee for all letters or parcels to be delivered within the\r\nbills of mortality was one penny, payable in advance. The penny rate was\r\nuniform for all letters and parcels up to one pound in weight, which was\r\nthe maximum allowed. Articles or money to the value of £10 might be sent\r\nand the penny payment insured their safe delivery. There was a daily\r\ndelivery to places ten or fifteen miles from London and there was also a\r\ndaily collection for such places. The charge of one penny in such cases\r\npaid only for conveyance to the post-house and an additional penny was\r\npaid on delivery. From such places to London, however, only one penny\r\nwas demanded and there was no fee for delivery. The carriers in London\r\ntravelled on foot, but in some of the neighbouring towns they rode on\r\nhorseback.[137]\r\n\r\n[137] Stow, _London_, bk. v, pp. 403-04; Thos. DeLaune, _Present State\r\nof London_, 1681, pp. 346-47; W. Thornbury, _Old and New London_, ii, p.\r\n209; Noorthouck, _Hist. of London_, 1773, p. 252. Noorthouck is mistaken\r\nin making Murray the promoter of the London Penny Post, although the\r\nidea may have originated with him.\r\n\r\nDockwra is credited with being the first to make use of post-marks. All\r\nletters were stamped at the six principal receiving-offices with the\r\nname of the receiving-office and the hour of their reception. For\r\ninstance, we have samples of letters post-marked thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first figure shows that they were Penny Post letters and that they\r\nwere prepaid. The \"W\" in the centre is the initial letter of the\r\nreceiving-office, Westminster. The second figure shows the hour of\r\narrival at the Westminster office, 9 A.M. The earliest instance of these\r\nmarks is on a letter dated Dec. 9, 1681, written by the Bishop of London\r\nto the Lord Mayor.[138]\r\n\r\n[138] _Notes and Queries_, ser. 6, xi, p. 153; Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._,\r\n10, app. 4, pp. 125, 132; Joyce, p. 38.\r\n\r\nWhenever letters came from any part of the world by the General Post,\r\ndirected to persons in London or in any of the towns where the Penny\r\nPost carriers went, they were handed over to these carriers to be\r\ndelivered. In the same way, letters directed to any part of the world\r\nmight be left at any of the receiving-offices of the Penny Post to be\r\ncarried by its messengers to the General Office. This must have\r\nincreased greatly the number of letters carried by the General Post. In\r\nthe case of letters arriving by the General and delivered by the Penny\r\nPost, the postage was paid on delivery.[139] Over two hundred and thirty\r\nyears ago then, London had for a time a system of postal delivery not\r\nonly unrivalled until a short time ago, but in the matter of parcel\r\nrates and insurance not yet equalled.\r\n\r\n[139] DeLaune, _Present State of London_, 1681, p. 345.\r\n\r\nWhat was Dockwra's reward for the boon which he had conferred? He\r\nhimself says that it had been undertaken at his sole charge and had cost\r\nhim £10,000. It had not paid for the first few months, and the friends\r\nwho had associated themselves with him fell away.[140] As long as it\r\nproduced no surplus, Dockwra was left to do as he pleased, for the\r\nGeneral Post was gaining indirectly from it. As soon as it began to pay,\r\nthe Duke of York cast his eye on it. In 1683 an action was brought\r\nagainst Dockwra for infringing upon the prerogative of His Royal\r\nHighness, and the Duke won the case. The Penny Post was incorporated in\r\nthe General Post soon after.[141] After William and Mary had come to the\r\nthrone, Dockwra was given a pension of £500 a year for seven years. At\r\nthe end of that time he was appointed manager of the Penny Post\r\nDepartment of the General Post and his pension was continued for three\r\nyears longer. In 1700 he was dismissed, charged with \"forbidding the\r\ntaking in of band-boxes (unless very small) and all parcels above one\r\npound in weight, with stopping parcels, and opening and detaining\r\nletters.\"[142] Such was Dockwra's reward and such had been Witherings'.\r\nHe who would reform the Post Office must be prepared to take his\r\nofficial life in his hands.\r\n\r\n[140] _Cal. B. P._, 1697-1702, xliv, 56.\r\n\r\n[141] Two men living in Limerick and Tipperary claimed in 1692 that they\r\nhad organized a Penny Post in Ireland (_Cal. S. P. D._, 1691-92, p.\r\n449). In 1704 the Countess Dowager of Thanet petitioned to be allowed to\r\nestablish a Penny Post in Dublin, but nothing was done (_Cal. T. P._,\r\n1702-07, lxxxix, 305).\r\n\r\n[142] _Cal. T. P._, 1697-1702, lxxi, 40; Charles Knight, _London_, 1842,\r\niii, p. 282.\r\n\r\nThe transition between two reigns was usually a period of unrest and\r\ndisquietude, and the Revolution which resulted in the expulsion of James\r\nwas naturally accompanied by internal disorder. For a time the posts\r\nsuffered quite severely. The Irish and Scotch mails were robbed several\r\ntimes and not even the \"Black Box\" escaped. This was the box in which\r\nwere carried the despatches between Scotland and the Secretaries of\r\nState, the use of which was not discontinued until after the accession\r\nof the new King and Queen. After 1693 each Secretary was to send and\r\nreceive his own despatches separately and all expenses were to be met\r\nfrom the proceeds of the London-Berwick post.[143] Major Wildman had\r\nbeen appointed to the oversight of the Post Office, but held office for\r\na few months only, being succeeded in 1691 by Cotton and Frankland. The\r\nPostmasters-General were henceforth to act under the Lords of the\r\nTreasury.[144]\r\n\r\n[143] Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._, 12, app., pt. 7, p. 262; _Cal. S. P. D._,\r\n1690-91, p. 50; Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._,15, app., pt. 9, pp. 144, 180;\r\n_Cal. T. P._, 1557-1696, p. 284.\r\n\r\n[144] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1689-90, pp. 59, 74; _Cal. T. P._, 1557-1696, p.\r\n203.\r\n\r\nImportant improvements in the frequency and extension of postal\r\ncommunication were inaugurated under the management of Cotton and\r\nFrankland. It was, however, for the extension of the foreign postal\r\nservice and for that to Ireland and the plantations that their\r\nadministration is most notable.\r\n\r\nOn Monday and Thursday letters went to France, Italy, and Spain, on\r\nMonday and Friday to the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. On\r\nTuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, mails left for all parts of England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland, and there was a daily post to Kent and the Downs.\r\nLetters arrived in London from all parts of England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, from Wales every Monday and\r\nfrom Kent and the Downs every day. Besides the establishment of the\r\nGeneral Post in London, there were about 200 deputy postmasters employed\r\nin England and Scotland.[145] The Irish Post was supervised from London\r\nand during the Irish war its headquarters in Ireland were transferred\r\nfrom Dublin to Belfast. It was directly managed by a Deputy\r\nPostmaster-General, aided by ten or a dozen officials and clerks. The\r\nnet receipts were sent to England and the books were audited by a deputy\r\nsent over by the Auditor-General of the English Post.[146]\r\n\r\n[145] Stow, _London_, bk. v, p. 401; DeLaune, _Present State of\r\nEngland_, ed. 1690, p. 343.\r\n\r\n[146] _Cal. T. P._, 1557-1696, pp. 369, 461.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch Post Office was not in so good condition as the Irish. The\r\ntime when every Scotchman could read and write was yet very far distant.\r\nThe only post road of any importance was from Edinburgh to Berwick and\r\nthis had been established by the English. For many years the vast\r\nmajority of letters travelling over this road were official despatches.\r\nAfter the crowns of England and Scotland were united, it was necessary\r\nfor the English Government to keep in close touch with Scotland and\r\n\"Black Box\" made frequent journeys between the two countries. The canny\r\npeople in the north had discovered a rich country to the south waiting\r\nto be exploited, and the post horses between Edinburgh and London were\r\nkept busy carrying the lean and hungry northern folk to the land of milk\r\nand honey. Until 1695 the English and Scotch Post Offices had been\r\nunited under the English Postmaster-General with an Edinburgh deputy;\r\nbut by the Scotch act of 1695 the Post Office of Scotland was separated\r\nfrom that of England. The terms of this act were much the same as those\r\nof the English act of 1660, although the rates established were somewhat\r\nhigher. There was to be a Postmaster-General living in Edinburgh, who\r\nwas to have the monopoly of carrying all letters and packets where posts\r\nwere settled.[147]\r\n\r\n[147] _Acts of Parliament of Scotland_, ix., pp. 417-419 (5 Wm. III).\r\n\r\nThe first proposal for a postal establishment in the American colonies\r\ncame from New England in 1638. The reason given was that a post office\r\nwas \"so useful and absolutely necessary.\"[148] Nothing was done by the\r\nhome government until fifty years later when a proclamation was issued,\r\nordering letter offices to be settled in convenient places on the North\r\nAmerican continent. Rates were established for the continental colonies\r\nand Jamaica.[149] In 1691, acting upon a report of the Governors of the\r\nPost-Office, the Lords of Trade and Plantations granted a patent to\r\nThomas Neale to establish post offices in North America. About the same\r\ntime an act was passed by the Colony of Massachusetts appointing Andrew\r\nHamilton Postmaster-General. The Lords of Trade and Plantations called\r\nattention to the fact that this act was not subject to the patent\r\ngranted to Neale. Matters were adjusted by Neale himself, who appointed\r\nHamilton his deputy in North America.[150] In 1699 a report was made by\r\nCotton and Frankland to the Lords of the Treasury based on a memorial\r\nfrom Neale and Hamilton. The latter had established a regular weekly\r\npost between Boston and New York and from New York to Newcastle in\r\nPennsylvania. The receipts had increased every year and now covered all\r\nexpenses except Hamilton's own salary, £200. Postmasters had been\r\nappointed in New York and Philadelphia, Hamilton himself being in\r\nBoston. The New York postmaster received a salary of £20 with an\r\nadditional £90 for carrying the mail half-way to Boston. The\r\nPhiladelphia postmaster was paid £10 a year.[151]\r\n\r\n[148] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1574-1660, p. 273.\r\n\r\n[149] Joyce, pp. 196, 300.\r\n\r\n[150] _Cal. S. P. Am. and W. I._, 1693-96, p. 637.\r\n\r\n[151] _Cal. T. P._, 1697-1702, lx, 77.\r\n\r\nThe business of the Post Office was rapidly increasing. The same decade\r\nthat saw the establishment of the Board of Trade witnessed also the\r\norganization of the Colonial Post. The expansion of English\r\ncommerce[152] necessarily reacted on communications both internal and\r\nforeign, while the linking of the country posts with the general system\r\nand the stimulus given by the London Penny Post showed itself in the\r\nincreased postal revenue.[153] The way was prepared for the great\r\nexpansion of the following century, an expansion turned to account as a\r\nsource of taxation.\r\n\r\n[152] Macpherson, _Annals of Commerce_, ii, 707.\r\n\r\n[153] See Appendix: Tables I, II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE POSTAL ESTABLISHMENT AN INSTRUMENT OF TAXATION\r\n\r\n1711-1840\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1711 is an important landmark in the history of the British\r\nPost Office. England and Scotland had united not only under one king but\r\nunder one Parliament, the war with France made a larger revenue\r\nnecessary, the growth of the Colonies required better communication with\r\nthe mother country and each other, and it was highly expedient that\r\ncertain changes in the policy of the Post Office should receive\r\nparliamentary sanction. The act of 1711 was intended to meet these\r\nconditions. The English and Scotch Post Offices were united under one\r\nPostmaster-General in London, where letters might be received from and\r\nsent to all parts of Great Britain, Ireland, the colonies and foreign\r\ncountries. The postage rates were increased to meet the demand for a\r\nlarger revenue. In addition to the General Office in London, chief\r\nletter offices were ordered to be set up in Edinburgh, Dublin, New York,\r\nthe West Indies, and other American colonies, and deputies were\r\nappointed to take charge of them.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important clauses of this act, by providing regulations\r\nfor the management of the London Penny Post, finally placed the seal of\r\nthe approval of Parliament upon a branch of the General Post, which had\r\nexisted for nearly thirty years by virtue of royal proclamations and\r\nlegal decisions alone. A penny rate was imposed upon all letters and\r\npackets passing by the Penny Post in London, Westminster and Southwark\r\nto be received and delivered within ten miles from the General Post\r\nOffice building. This would seem at first sight to be an improvement on\r\nthe old custom, by which a penny had carried only within the bills of\r\nmortality; but as a matter of fact an extra penny was demanded on\r\nletters delivered outside the bills and within the ten mile limit.\r\nProtest was, however, made against this as being illegal, and it was\r\nnot until 1730 that the custom was sanctioned.[154]\r\n\r\n[154] In 1765 the maximum weight for articles passing wholly by the\r\nPenny Post was lowered from 16 to 4 ounces (5 Geo. III, c. 25).\r\n\r\nOne other provision of the new act remains to be mentioned. The last\r\nsection forbade any official connected with the Post Office from\r\nmeddling in politics.[155] The system of party government which had\r\nbegun to take form during William and Mary's reign, was developing.\r\nUnder Anne, the Whigs had been the war party, the expansionists, while\r\nthe Tories were anxious for peace. So different were their policies that\r\nMarlborough had gone over to the Whigs. But the Queen and probably the\r\nmajority of the people were tired of war. Godolphin, the great\r\nfinancier, had given way to Harley and the general election was\r\nfavourable to the Tories. Frankland had died before the act was passed,\r\nbut Cotton, who was a member of Parliament, preferred to keep his\r\nposition in the Post Office and accordingly accepted the Chiltern\r\nHundreds. A Mr. Evelyn was associated with him as Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\n[155] 9 Anne, c. 11.\r\n\r\nShortly after his appointment the attention of the department was\r\ndirected to a weakness in administrative control which had already\r\nresulted in considerable financial loss. The Postmasters-General had\r\nalways experienced considerable difficulty in collecting the postage on\r\nbye and cross road letters.[156] Since these letters did not reach\r\nLondon, no check was possible to ascertain whether the postmaster\r\ntransmitted to headquarters the full amount of the postage collected on\r\nthem. The difficulty had been met before 1711 by farming a large number\r\nof the country post offices.[157] In 1711 the leases under which the\r\nfarmers had held office were cancelled and all the posts in the kingdom\r\ncame again under the direct oversight of the Postmasters-General. The\r\nold farmers were made managers, with an allowance of 10 per cent from\r\nthe net proceeds of the posts under their control, and the deputy\r\npostmasters were again paid directly by the state. The Government had\r\nrefused o appoint surveyors when the act of 1711 was drafted and for a\r\ntime these managers acted in that capacity.[158] The experiment was not\r\na success and the Postmasters-General were at their wits' end to know\r\nwhat to do to save the revenue which was being diverted to the pockets\r\nof the country postmasters.\r\n\r\n[156] A bye-letter was the name given to a letter carried over one of\r\nthe great roads but not passing to, from or through London. A cross post\r\nletter passed not over the great roads, but over subsidiary or minor\r\nroads.\r\n\r\n[157] Joyce, p. 136.\r\n\r\n[158] _Cal. T. P._, 1714-19, cxc, 26; ccvi, 29.\r\n\r\nThe country was happily spared any new device on their part, for in 1721\r\na man came forward with a proposal to take all the losses upon himself\r\nor rather to prevent them entirely. This was Ralph Allen, whose name is\r\nworth remembering, not as a reformer but as a good business man who came\r\nto the rescue of the postal revenue at a rather critical time. He was\r\nthe son of an innkeeper at St. Blazey. At an early age we find him\r\nliving with his grandmother, the postmistress of St. Columb. He came\r\nunder the notice of one of the surveyors there on account of the\r\nneatness with which he kept the accounts for his grandmother. When he\r\nwas old enough, he was appointed to a position in the Post Office at\r\nBath and in time was made postmaster there. Tradition has it that during\r\nthe insurrection of 1715 he informed the authorities that a wagon load\r\nof arms was on its way from the West for the use of the rebels and that\r\nthis led to his preferment.[159] He offered to farm the cross and bye\r\nposts throughout the kingdom. The net product from these posts amounted\r\nto £4000 in 1719. Allen offered to pay half as much again and meet all\r\nexpenses. The offer was accepted, and in 1721 he was given the lease of\r\nthe cross and bye posts for a period of seven years. The rent was fixed\r\nat £6000 a year in accordance with the agreement. For the first quarter,\r\nthe receipts exceeded expectations, but later the postmasters began to\r\nrelapse into their old ways. In addition, the contract was rather hard\r\non Allen, as £300 of the £4000 nominally received by the Post Office was\r\nfor letters not delivered and hence not paid for. After the third year,\r\nmatters began to improve and the receipts increased greatly. The\r\ncontract was renewed for terms of seven years, until Allen's death in\r\n1769, and the rent was increased at each renewal.[160]\r\n\r\n[159] Joyce, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[160] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1731-34, p. 539; W. Thornbury, _Old and New\r\nLondon_, ii, p. 209; W. Lewins, _Her Majesty's Mails_, ed. 1865, pp.\r\n104-12.\r\n\r\nHow did he succeed when so many others had failed? In the first place\r\nhe introduced the use of post bills and every postmaster had to\r\ndistinguish on these bills the bye letters from all others. The voucher,\r\nwhich he also introduced, seems to have been only an acknowledgment of\r\nthe amount to be collected by each postmaster. Besides this, Allen had a\r\nmost intimate knowledge of the various post towns in the kingdom, of\r\ntheir importance and of the number of letters which might naturally be\r\nexpected to pass between them. He based his conclusions upon quite\r\nobvious considerations. Between any two towns of much the same\r\nimportance he expected about the same correspondence, that it would not\r\nvary much, and that the letters received and despatched would pretty\r\nwell equal each other.[161]\r\n\r\n[161] Joyce, pp. 155, 162.\r\n\r\nWhen Allen's contract was renewed in 1741 it was proposed that he should\r\nbe obliged to settle and support at his own charge posts six days a week\r\ninstead of the former tri-weekly posts between London, Cambridge, Lynn,\r\nNorwich, and Yarmouth and from London to Bath, Bristol, Gloucester, and\r\nintermediate towns. This was not done at once, but during the next few\r\nyears this proposition was put into effect.[162] In 1734, in addition to\r\nhis cross and bye post letters, Allen undertook to pay for the\r\nimprovements which he had made in the conveyance of country\r\nletters.[163] He pointed out at the same time that there was some\r\nopposition between the two parts of his contract, since country and\r\ncross post letters interfered more or less with each other.[164]\r\n\r\n[162] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1730-41, pp. 449-450.\r\n\r\n[163] Country letters were those sent through London. _Cal. T. B. & P._,\r\n1739-41, p. 450.\r\n\r\n[164] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1734-41, pp. 445, 450; W. Thornbury, _Old and\r\nNew London_, ii, p. 209.\r\n\r\nAllen died in 1769, being worth, according to current report, £500,000.\r\nLewins says that he made £12,000 a year from his farm. Probably both\r\nstatements are exaggerated, but it is certain that he accumulated a\r\nrespectable fortune while managing the bye and cross posts.[165]\r\n\r\n[165] He is the man to whom Pope alluded in the couplet,\r\n\r\n\"Let humble Allen, with an honest shame, Do good by stealth and blush to\r\nfind it fame.\"\r\n\r\nAllen and the poet had a falling out just before the death of the\r\nlatter. In his will, Pope left his quondam friend £150 to pay a \"few\r\nlittle debts.\" Allen is said to have remarked that if Pope had added\r\nanother figure, it would have represented better the \"few little debts.\"\r\nW. Lewins, _Her Majesty's Mails_, pp. 104-12.\r\n\r\nThere had been a considerable increase in the staff of the General\r\nOffice and many improvements introduced since 1711. At the head of the\r\noffice were two Commissioners called Postmasters-General, each with a\r\nsalary of £2000, assisted by a Secretary and four clerks. There were in\r\naddition a Receiver-General, an Accountant-General, a Solicitor, a\r\nResident-Surveyor, and two inspectors of missent letters. In addition to\r\nthe Penny Post carriers, who were employed also by the General Post,\r\nthere were a Court Messenger and a carrier for the House of Commons. At\r\nthe General Office, letters were taxed and sorted by the \"Clerks of the\r\nRoad\" and their assistants and by seventeen sorters. The window-man and\r\nalphabet-keeper received the money on prepaid letters and posted lists\r\nof those for whom letters had arrived. Undertaxed letters from the\r\ncountry were re-taxed by the \"Clerks of the Road.\" Besides the\r\nreceiving-houses of the Penny Post where all letters might be posted,\r\nthere were thirty receiving-houses for the General Post. Letters were\r\nconveyed from these to the central office by sixty-nine carriers.[166]\r\n\r\n[166] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1742-45, pp. 102-235; Maitland, _Survey of\r\nLondon_, p. 998; Noorthouck, _Hist. of London_, 1773, p. 658.\r\n\r\nLetters were sent every night to the principal South and Midland towns\r\nof England. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, there were mails for all\r\nparts of England and Scotland and on Tuesday and Saturday for Ireland\r\nand Wales. On Monday and Thursday, letters were sent to France, Spain,\r\nand Italy, on Monday and Friday to Germany, Flanders, Sweden, and\r\nDenmark, and on Tuesday and Friday to Holland. Letters arrived in London\r\nevery day from the South and Midland towns, on Monday, Wednesday, and\r\nFriday, from all parts of England and Scotland, and on Monday and Friday\r\nfrom Ireland and Wales.[167] It will be seen from this that the\r\nimprovements in postal communications, which had taken place since the\r\nbeginning of the century, had been confined to the South and Midland\r\ntowns of England and to foreign countries.\r\n\r\n[167] J. Latimer, _Annals of Bristol_, 1893, p. 235; _London and its\r\nEnvirons_, 1761, v, pp. 209-222.\r\n\r\nWith the foregoing enlargement of postal facilities an old grievance on\r\nthe part of the public began to assume an acute form. It had always been\r\na debated question as to how far the postmasters were responsible for\r\nthe delivery of letters. There was no general rule upon the question and\r\nthe practice varied in different parts of England. Although the towns on\r\nthe post roads were fairly well off as far as their letters were\r\nconcerned, it was different with those places which were neither on the\r\ngreat roads nor on the bye-roads leading off from them. The mails for\r\nsuch places were left at the nearest post towns and were conveyed to\r\ntheir destination by carriers and messengers. Cotton and Frankland\r\nstated that in addition to collecting the regular postage, they demanded\r\nfor this service an extra payment of 3_d._, 6_d._, and sometimes 12_d._\r\nIt was proposed in 1699 that the delivery should be made by persons\r\nappointed to collect as well as to deliver all letters and parcels. For\r\nthis they were allowed to take one penny or whatever the people wished\r\nto give them.[168] In Sandwich the cross and bye post letters had always\r\nbeen delivered free, although a fee was charged for the London letters.\r\nThe postmaster there decided to charge for all letters, and the\r\ninhabitants of Sandwich protested. The case was carried to the courts\r\nand the Post Office lost. Sandwich, however, was a place where there had\r\nbeen a free delivery of part of the letters at least. The\r\nPostmasters-General were very much disturbed at this decision and still\r\nmore disturbed lest the courts might decide for free delivery in other\r\npost towns, which had always paid. They resolved to bring on a test\r\ncase. The town of Hungerford in Berkshire was chosen, as it could be\r\nproved that the postmaster of that place had received a penny for each\r\nletter delivered since the beginning of the century. The case came\r\nbefore the Court of King's Bench, Lord Mansfield presiding, and the Post\r\nOffice lost again. This case was decided in 1774, and the next year the\r\n\"Liverpool Advertiser\" records a complaint to the Postmasters-General\r\nthat there was only one letter carrier in Liverpool. The reply was that\r\nonly one carrier was maintained in any provincial town and that\r\nLiverpool could expect no better treatment.[169]\r\n\r\n[168] _Cal. T. B._, 1697-1702, lxiv, 17; _ibid._, 1702-07, lxxxvi, 134.\r\n\r\n[169] E. Green, _Bibliotheca Somersetensis_, 1902, i, p. 108; Joyce, pp.\r\n107-108; Latimer, _Annals of Bristol_, p. 416.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the Post Office received this adverse decision it\r\nhad begun to suffer severely from the illegal carriage of letters by the\r\npost coaches. These post coaches were so called merely because they were\r\nmost numerous on the post roads. John Palmer, the proprietor of a\r\ntheatre in Bath, pointed out to the Postmasters-General that the coaches\r\nwere speedier and cheaper than the post boys who carried the mails on\r\nhorseback and proposed that he should be allowed to establish mail\r\ncoaches and thus save the postage on letters illegally carried by the\r\npost coaches. His coaches were to be protected by a guard, presumably a\r\nretired soldier, who was to be armed with two guns and to sit facing the\r\nroad in front of him. The driver was to carry pistols. No outside\r\npassengers were to be carried, since they impeded the guard in\r\nperforming his duties. The speed was to be not less than eight or nine\r\nmiles an hour, twice as fast as the post boys travelled. In addition the\r\nmails were to leave London at 8 P.M. instead of after midnight. The\r\ncoaches were all to leave London together and return together as far as\r\npossible. To insure this they were not to wait for government letters\r\nwhen the latter were delayed.[170]\r\n\r\n[170] _D. N. B._, xliii, p. 140; Knight, _London_, 1842, iii, p. 280.\r\n\r\nThe first mail coach ran between London and Bristol in 1784. It was\r\nfurnished by contractors at a cost of 3_d._ a mile. This was the initial\r\ncost, however, and by 1797, the rate had been reduced to a penny a mile\r\neach way. In the early part of August, 1784, there was only one mail\r\ncoach. At the end of the same month, coaches went to Norwich,\r\nNottingham, Liverpool, and Manchester. During the next year they were\r\nsent to Leeds, Gloucester, Swansea, Hereford, Milford, Worcester,\r\nBirmingham, Shrewsbury, Holyhead, Exeter, Portsmouth, and other places.\r\nIn 1786 they ran between London and Edinburgh. In 1797 there were\r\nforty-two mail coach routes established, connecting sixty of the most\r\nimportant towns in the kingdom, as well as intermediate places. These\r\ncoaches travelled a total distance of 4110 miles and cost the Government\r\n£12,416 a year, only half the sum paid for post horses and riders under\r\nthe old system. The coaches made daily journeys over nearly two thirds\r\nof the total distance traversed and tri-weekly journeys over something\r\nless than one third the total distance. The remainder travelled one,\r\ntwo, four, and six times a week. The result of the establishment of\r\nthese mail coaches was summed up by a Parliamentary committee in the\r\nfollowing words: \"They have lessened the chance of robbery, diminished\r\nthe need for special messengers and expresses, and now carry the letters\r\nformerly sent by post coaches.\"[171]\r\n\r\n[171] _Parl. Papers_, 1812-13, _Rep. Com._, ii, pp. 4, 36, 37, 98; _Fin.\r\nRep._, 1797, no. 7, p. 114; _D. N. B._, xliii, p. 140.\r\n\r\nPalmer had been appointed Controller-General of the Post Office and had\r\nchosen as his assistant a man by the name of Bonner. Palmer himself was\r\nof a violent and headstrong disposition, and as ill-luck would have it,\r\nWalsingham, one of the Postmasters-General, was as masterful as himself.\r\nPalmer considered that his office was outside the scope of Walsingham's\r\nauthority, and although he failed in making his position absolutely free\r\nfrom the control of the Postmasters-General, yet he heeded them as\r\nlittle as possible. He organized a newspaper department without\r\nconsulting his superiors and paid no attention to them when an\r\nexplanation was asked. He stirred up the London merchants to complain\r\nabout the late delivery of their letters, a delay which he had probably\r\nbrought about intentionally. A mail coach had been ordered by Walsingham\r\nto carry the King's private despatches while His Majesty was taking the\r\nwaters at Cheltenham. This was done without consulting Palmer, who was\r\nso indignant that he persuaded the contractor to send in an enormous\r\nbill for supplying the coach. All this came out through the treachery of\r\nBonner, who owed his advancement entirely to the friend whom he\r\nbetrayed. He went so far as to hand over to the Postmasters-General the\r\nprivate letters which Palmer had written him. Palmer was dismissed in\r\n1792 with a pension.[172]\r\n\r\n[172] _Fin. Rep._, 1797, no. 7, pp. 82-83; Joyce, pp. 251, 275.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Palmer's appointment, a Treasury warrant had been issued\r\nfor the payment to him of £1500 a year and 2 per cent of the increase\r\nfrom the Post Office revenue, but this warrant had been pronounced\r\nillegal by the Attorney-General. Through Pitt's influence, Palmer\r\nfinally obtained £1500 a year and 2 per cent on any increase in net\r\nrevenue over £240,000 a year. Palmer objected to this on the ground\r\nthat the old net revenue was only £150,000 a year, but Pitt replied that\r\nthe increased rates of 1784 would produce at least £90,000. It is\r\nimprobable, however, that the new rates produced the increase estimated.\r\nIn 1797 Palmer presented a petition to the House of Commons, asking for\r\nthe arrears due him according to his method of estimating the increase\r\nin net revenue, upon which his percentage was due. He said that before\r\nhis system was introduced the gross product of the Post Office was\r\ndecreasing at the rate of £13,000 a year. This was not true. He claimed\r\nthat the increase after 1784 was wholly due to his own reforms, taking\r\nno account of the increased rates and the industrial expansion of\r\nEngland. No action was taken by Parliament.[173]\r\n\r\n[173] _Fin. Rep._, 1797, no. 7, p. 127; _Jo. H. C._, 1796-97, p. 581.\r\n\r\nOne of the arguments advanced by Palmer for the use of mail coaches was\r\ntheir security against robbers. Previous to and during the rebellion of\r\n1745 numerous attempts were made to rob the mails, and many of them were\r\nsuccessful. These robberies occurred principally at night. It was said\r\nthat the mails were carried by boys not always of the best character,\r\nand that very often they were in league with the robbers. The\r\nPostmasters-General asked for soldiers to patrol the roads where these\r\nrobberies were the most frequent. This was the method which Cromwell had\r\nused to protect the mails. The request does not seem to have been\r\ngranted, but in 1765 the death penalty was imposed for robbing the mail\r\nand for stealing a letter containing a bank note or bill. Any post boy\r\ndeserting the mail or allowing any one but the guard to ride on the\r\nhorse or carriage with the mails was liable to commitment to hard\r\nlabour.[174] Palmer's prediction was fulfilled by the comparative safety\r\nwith which the mails were carried after his coaches had come into use.\r\n\r\n[174] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1739-41, p. 234; 5 Geo. III, c. 25. The Post\r\nOffice occasionally made good the loss of valuables from theft or\r\nrobbery, but as a rule refused to do so. _Cal. T. P._, 1729-30, p. 75;\r\n_Cal. T. B. & P._, 1731-34, p. 74.\r\n\r\nCharles, Earl of Tankerville, and Lord Carteret had been the\r\nPostmasters-General in 1782 and 1783. On the fall of Shelburne's\r\nministry in the latter year, Tankerville left the Post Office, but\r\nCarteret still remained. So far these two men had worked together\r\nfairly well, although Tankerville had a suspicion that his colleague\r\nhad been engaged in some doubtful transactions. In 1784, when Pitt\r\nbecame Prime Minister, Tankerville was restored to his old office. In\r\nthe same year a transaction came under his notice which aroused his\r\nsuspicion. A Mr. Lees had been appointed Secretary of the Irish Post\r\nOffice. The man who had held this position was made agent of the Dover\r\npacket boats, the old agent having been superannuated. The new agent\r\nagreed to pay to his predecessor the full amount of the salary coming to\r\nthe place, while he himself was to be paid by Mr. Lees the total salary\r\ncoming to the Secretary in Ireland. So far there was nothing uncommon\r\nabout the arrangement. The unusual part of the agreement and the part\r\nwhich attracted Tankerville's attention was Lees' promise to pay the\r\nmoney to \"A. B.,\" an unknown person, after the old agent's death.\r\nSuspicion pointed to Carteret as the man to whom the money was to be\r\npaid. Lees himself denied this, but did not say who \"A. B.\" was.[175]\r\n\r\n[175] _Jo. H. C._, 1787, p. 800.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 a Mr. Staunton, the postmaster of Islesworth, a position worth\r\n£400 a year, was in addition appointed Controller and Resident Surveyor\r\nof the Bye and Cross Posts, to which was attached a salary of £500,\r\ncoals and candles and a house. The First Lord of the Treasury proposed\r\nthat the house should not go with the office, and Carteret decided that\r\nStaunton should receive an extra £100 a year in lieu of the house.\r\nTankerville refused to agree to this, and the contention became so warm\r\nthat the whole matter was referred to Pitt, who, rather than lose\r\nCarteret's political support, dismissed Tankerville.[176] Tankerville at\r\nonce demanded an investigation, which was granted. The results showed\r\nthe Post Office to be in a deplorable state. Tankerville was completely\r\nexonerated, but failed to obtain much sympathy on account of the\r\nviolence of his attack upon Pitt and Carteret. It came out in the\r\ninvestigation that \"A. B.\" was a foreigner named Treves, who had no\r\nclaim on the Post Office or any other department of the government\r\nexcept that he was a friend of Carteret. Carteret himself knew the\r\ncondition of his appointment, but had done nothing except to express\r\nhimself displeased with the whole arrangement. A payment of £200 a year\r\nhad also been exacted from Mr. Dashwood, Postmaster-General of Jamaica,\r\nas the condition of his appointment, and that too had gone to Treves.\r\nThe agent at Helvoetsluys had been allowed by Carteret to sell his\r\nposition to a man as incapable as himself. Staunton's office had been\r\nabolished soon after his appointment, and he had been allowed to retire\r\nat the age of forty years with a pension of £600 a year in the face of\r\nthe rule that officers of an advanced age and after long service were\r\nallowed upon retirement to receive only two thirds of their\r\nsalaries.[177]\r\n\r\n[176] _Ibid._, 1787, p. 800.\r\n\r\n[177] _Jo. H. C._, 1787, p. 800.\r\n\r\nThe Postmasters-General had received in 1783, in addition to their\r\nsalaries, over £900 for coals. They had also received £694 for candles\r\nduring two years and a half and £150 for tinware for the same period.\r\nTankerville had taken his share of these perquisites, but it is only\r\nfair to add that Carteret's emoluments exceeded his by £213 for the\r\nperiods under consideration. It had become customary to receive a money\r\npayment in place of a large part of their supplies. In 1782 the total\r\nsum going to the officials of the General Office amounted to £28,431, of\r\nwhich sum about £10,000 were placed under the heading of emoluments\r\nother than salaries.[178] Of all the departments of the Post Office, the\r\nSailing Packet Service was the one most in need of reform.\r\n\r\n[178] _Fin. Rep._, 1797, no. 7, pp. 82-83; _Jo. H. C._, 1787, p 817.\r\n\r\nThe light, which was then let in among the dark places of the Post\r\nOffice, had a most excellent effect. Acting on the report furnished by\r\nthe committee of the House, a new establishment was effected in 1793.\r\nThe reforms were approved by the Postmasters-General and carried out\r\nunder the direction of the Lords of the Treasury. The good work had been\r\nbegun in 1784 by Palmer. He had appointed additional clerks, letter\r\ncarriers, surveyors and messengers, had established new offices, and had\r\nincreased the inadequate pay of minor officials. This had entailed an\r\nincrease of £19,022 in expenses in the General and Penny Posts, but the\r\nincrease was justified by increased efficiency and by larger returns\r\nfrom the conveyance of letters. Of the total increase, £11,451 had been\r\nspent on the General Office and £7571 on the Penny Post, to which had\r\nbeen added eighty-six more letter carriers for London and seventy-eight\r\nmore for the suburbs, as well as some supernumerary carriers.[179] The\r\nreforms introduced in 1793 may be grouped under three heads: regulations\r\nrespecting fees and emoluments, abolition of some offices and an\r\nincrease in officers and clerks in others; regulation of official\r\nbusiness. The regulations respecting fees and emoluments were\r\nnecessarily negative in their character. The most important were as\r\nfollows: The postmasters were no longer to pay fees to the\r\nPostmasters-General on the renewal of the bonds given by their\r\nsecurities. The two per cent allowed to the Scotch Deputy\r\nPostmaster-General on all remittances from Scotland was discontinued and\r\na compensation for life was granted instead. The fees for tinware were\r\nabolished, and the pension to the New York agent was to cease. No postal\r\nofficial was allowed to own shares in the sailing packets, and with a\r\nfew minor exceptions all salaries were henceforth to be in lieu of every\r\nemolument or fee.[180]\r\n\r\n[179] _Fin. Rep._, 1797, no. 7, pp. 3, 66-83.\r\n\r\n[180] _Ibid._, no. 7, pp. 52-65.\r\n\r\nA number of sinecure and useless offices were abolished. The chief among\r\nthem were: Jamineau's perquisite office which had the monopoly of\r\nselling newspapers to the \"Clerks of the Roads,\" the Secretary's\r\nposition as agent for the packets, the Controller of the Bye and Cross\r\nPosts, the Inspector of Dead Letters in the Bye Letter Office, the\r\nCollector in the Bye Letter Office, the Secretary of the Foreign Office,\r\nand the Controller of the Inland Office.[181]\r\n\r\n[181] _Ibid._, no. 7, pp. 52-65.\r\n\r\nThe changes in business regulations were as follows: The\r\nPostmasters-General were no longer to include legal charges, chaise\r\nhire, and pensions under the head of dead letters. The\r\nPostmasters-General's warrant must be entered previous to any money\r\nbeing paid. The payment of debts must be enforced. The West India\r\naccounts should be sent to the deputy there every quarter. The payments\r\nto mail coach contractors must be made directly by warrant instead of\r\nthrough the Controller-General. No change was made in the anomalous\r\nposition of the Accountant-General. He was supposed to be a check upon\r\nthe Receiver-General, but had to depend upon the Receiver-General's\r\nbooks for verifying the remittances from the deputies.[182]\r\n\r\n[182] _Ibid._, no. 7, pp. 8, 52-65.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman's belief in the sanctity of vested interests has usually\r\nbeen too strong to permit any abridgment of rights or privileges without\r\ncompensation. Those postal officials who had been dismissed or whose\r\nsinecure offices had been abolished were not to be turned entirely\r\nadrift. Provision was made for pensioning most of them. Before the\r\nreform the total sum paid by the Post Office in pensions was £1500. The\r\nincumbrances dismissed were allowed £6101, and between 1793 and 1797\r\n£1475 more were added to the pension list. It was pointed out at the\r\ntime that it was far better to pension them off and leave them to die\r\nthan to continue them in service. In 1797 it was a relief to be able to\r\nannounce \"that already £648 had been saved from dead and promoted\r\npensioners.\"[183]\r\n\r\n[183] _Fin. Rep._, no. 7, p. 130.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee which had been appointed at Tankerville's\r\nsuggestion is silent on the question of the opening and detention of\r\nletters. It had been provided by the act of 1711 that no letters should\r\nbe opened or detained except under protection of an express warrant from\r\none of the Secretaries of State. The Royal Commission of 1844 reported\r\nthat from 1712 to 1798, the number of warrants so issued was 101,\r\nexcluding those which were well known or easily ascertained. The\r\nSecretary of State for the Inland Department issued most of them. From\r\n1798 to 1844, 372 warrants were issued, many of them being general\r\nwarrants and often for very trivial causes. At the trial of Bishop\r\nAtterbury, the principal witnesses against him were Post Office clerks,\r\nwho had opened and copied letters to and from him, under warrant from\r\none of the Secretaries.[184]\r\n\r\n[184] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, pp. 9-11; app., p. 105 (78); app., p. 107\r\n(79); app., p. 111 (83).\r\n\r\nIn addition to this regular method for intercepting letters, a\r\nparticular department had been in existence for some time with no other\r\nduties than to examine letters. Strictly speaking it had nothing to do\r\nwith the Post Office and was supported entirely from the \"Secret Service\r\nFund.\" The truth about it came out in the examination of the conduct of\r\nSir Robert Walpole by the \"Committee of Secrecy.\" From 1732 to 1742,\r\n£45,675 had been spent upon this department. It had originated in 1718\r\nand the expenses for that year were only £446, but by 1742 they had\r\nincreased more than tenfold. The Secretary of the Post Office in giving\r\nhis evidence before the committee, said that this office received\r\ninstructions from the Secretaries of State and reported to them. The\r\nworking force consisted of a chief decipherer, assisted by his son and\r\nthree other decipherers, five clerks, the Controller of the Foreign\r\nOffice, a doorkeeper and a former alphabet keeper. Either considerable\r\nbusiness was transacted there or it was a retreat for useless\r\nofficials.[185]\r\n\r\n[185] _Rep. Com_., 1844, xiv, app., p. 112 (84); _Cal. T. B. & P_.,\r\n1742-45, p. 669.\r\n\r\nAn account is given in Howell's \"State Trials\" of the trial of Hensey\r\nand of the practice then in vogue for finding treasonable\r\ncorrespondence. His letters were handed over for investigation to the\r\nSecretary of State by a Post Office clerk. This clerk in giving his\r\nevidence said that when war was declared against any nation, the\r\nPostmasters-General issued orders at once to stop all suspected letters.\r\nThese orders were given to all the Post Office clerks and letter\r\ncarriers. Such instructions can only be justified as a war measure, for\r\nthe act of 1711 had provided that no letter should be detained or opened\r\nunless by express warrant from one of the Secretaries of State for every\r\nsuch detention or opening.[186]\r\n\r\n[186] _Rep. Com_., 1844, xiv, app., p. 112 (85); Howell, _State Trials_,\r\nxix, col. 1369. This was in 1758.\r\n\r\nWe find very few complaints about the opening of letters during the\r\nsecond half of the eighteenth century. On the other hand it must be\r\nconfessed that letters were at times opened and searched merely to learn\r\nthe beliefs and plans of political opponents. It is difficult to\r\ndetermine to how great an extent this practice was prevalent as there\r\nseems little doubt that the complainants may occasionally have been\r\nprompted by their own vanity to believe that their correspondence had\r\nbeen tampered with.[187] In 1795, during the great war with France, the\r\nGovernment ordered all letters directed to the United Provinces to be\r\ndetained. The question then was, what was to be done with them? None of\r\nthem seems to have been opened and the cause for their detention was\r\nonly to prevent any information being given to the enemy. Accordingly\r\nby an act of Parliament passed in the same year, the Post Office was\r\nempowered to return them to the writers.[188]\r\n\r\n[187] Joyce is of opinion that such practices were very common. So also\r\nis May (T. E. May, _Constitutional History of England_, 1882, iii, pp.\r\n44-49; D. B. Eaton, _Civil Service in Great Britain_, New York, 1880, p.\r\n115).\r\n\r\n[188] 35 Geo. III, c. 62.\r\n\r\nAlthough the larger part of the fees and emoluments enjoyed by the\r\npostal officials had been abolished in 1793, the proceeds from those\r\nwhich were left continued to increase steadily. By far the most\r\nlucrative was the privilege of franking newspapers, within the kingdom,\r\nto the colonies, and to foreign countries. Ever since newspapers had\r\nbeen printed, the \"Clerks of the Roads\" had been allowed to send them to\r\nany part of the kingdom without paying postage. After 1763, when members\r\nof Parliament were allowed the same privilege, every one felt at liberty\r\nto make use of a member's frank for this purpose, and the Clerks\r\nsuffered accordingly. Newspapers to the Colonies were franked by the\r\nSecretary of the Post Office and produced a revenue of £3700 in 1817,\r\nall of which went to Sir Francis Freeling who was then Secretary. In\r\n1825 the privilege of franking papers within the kingdom and to the\r\ncolonies was withdrawn, but compensation was granted to Sir\r\nFrancis.[189] This did not end the trouble, for the Clerks still acted\r\nas newspaper venders. On account of their official position they were\r\nable to post them until 8 P.M., while the regular newsvenders were\r\nallowed to do so only until 5 P.M. at the Lombard Street Office and 6\r\nP.M. at the General Office or they must pay a special fee of a halfpenny\r\non each.[190] Mr. Hume, the member for Montrose, brought the case before\r\nthe House, and in 1834 all Post Office officials were forbidden to sell\r\nnewspapers. At the same time the officials in the Foreign Office lost\r\nthe right to frank papers to any foreign country.[191]\r\n\r\n[189] _Rep. Commrs._, 1829, xi, pp. 215-222.\r\n\r\n[190] London _Times_, 1829, Oct. 6, p. 2; _ibid._, 1832, March 14, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[191] _Parl. Deb._, 3d ser., xxiv, col. 875.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Secretary's office had, since 1799 and 1801, issued\r\ntwo official publications, which paid no postage. These were called the\r\n\"Packet List\" and the \"Shipping List.\" The first of these contained all\r\nthe intelligence received at the Post Office concerning the sailing\r\npackets. The second contained information about private vessels,\r\nfurnished principally by \"Lloyds.\" The Commissioners commented upon this\r\npractice in very uncomplimentary language.[192] In addition, the\r\nmembers of the Secretary's department received fees on the deputations\r\ngranted to new postmasters in England and Wales, upon commissions\r\ngranted to agents and postmasters abroad, upon private expresses to and\r\nfrom London, and upon news supplied to the London press during a general\r\nelection.[193] In 1837 the fees on deputations and commissions were\r\nabolished, private expresses were discontinued, the \"Shipping List\" was\r\ndiscontinued, and the \"Packet List\" passed from the control of the Post\r\nOffice. The revenue from these fees in the Secretary's Office which were\r\nstill continued was to go henceforth to the general revenue.[194]\r\n\r\n[192] _Acc. & P._, 1817, pp. 4-16; _Rep. Commrs._, 1837, xxxiv, 8th rep.\r\napp., nos. 12, 13, 14.\r\n\r\n[193] _Ibid._, 1837, xxxiv, 8th rep., app., no. 12.\r\n\r\n[194] _Acc. & P._, 1837-38, xlv, 265, p. 5.\r\n\r\nAn extra charge of 6_d._ was demanded upon letters posted between 7 P.M.\r\nand 8 P.M. This had been the rule since 1800, and the proceeds went\r\neither to the Inland or Foreign Office. So also did the registration\r\nfees on ships' letters. These fees were transferred to the general\r\nrevenue in 1837.[195] In 1827 the total amount received in fees,\r\nemoluments, and gratuities by the officials in the London Office was\r\n£23,100, by agents and country postmasters £16,500. Most of these were\r\neither abolished or transferred to the general revenue in 1837.[196]\r\n\r\n[195] _Rep. Commrs._, 1837, xxxiv, 8th rep., app., no. 3.\r\n\r\n[196] _Rep. Commrs._, 1829, xi, p. 214.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of the Post Office during the eighteenth\r\ncentury was the extension of its service, which accompanied the\r\nindustrial expansion of the kingdom. The abuses which naturally flourish\r\nduring a prosperous period had been largely remedied by the reform of\r\n1793. The nation's need for a larger revenue led not only to a great\r\nincrease in postage rates but also to stricter economy in the\r\norganization of the Post Office. The London and Dublin Penny Posts were\r\nreformed and extended, the work of the General and Penny Posts in London\r\nwas harmonized, the employees were increased, and the new departments\r\nwhich had been established were reformed and consolidated.\r\n\r\nThe Newspaper Office which had been illegally established by Palmer was\r\ncontinued after his dismissal. Walsingham had objected to it on the\r\nground that Palmer had no right to appoint any officials without his\r\nconsent. Previously all newspapers had been forwarded to the postmasters\r\nfree of postage by the \"Clerks of the Roads.\" Now that they might be\r\nsent with the letters, they were brought in at the last moment still wet\r\nfrom the press so that they defaced the writing on the letters sent in\r\nthe same bag.[197] In 1784 a Dead Letter Office was also established.\r\nPreviously, dead and missent letters had been handed to a clerk in the\r\nGeneral Office. During Allen's farm of the cross and bye post letters,\r\nmissent letters were no longer forwarded to London, but any postmaster,\r\ninto whose hands they came, was instructed to place them on the right\r\ntrack.[198] Four years later a third office was instituted, a Money\r\nOrder Office. No order could be issued for more than five guineas and\r\nthe fee for that sum was 4_s._ 6_d._ It was started as a private\r\nspeculation by some of the postal officials and so remained until 1838\r\nwhen it was taken over by the General Post Office.[199]\r\n\r\n[197] _Parl. Papers_, 1812-13, _Rep. Com._, ii, p. 87.\r\n\r\n[198] _Fin. Rep._, 1797, no. 7, pp. 82-83.\r\n\r\n[199] W. Thornbury, _Old and New London_, ii, p. 212.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Post Office with reference to the registration of\r\nletters containing valuables varied with the nature of the enclosure and\r\nthe manner in which it was sent. On ships' letters sent from England,\r\nthe registration fee was one guinea, and a receipt was given to the\r\nperson sending a registered letter. The fee for a letter coming into the\r\nkingdom was only 5_s._[200] If bank notes were enclosed in a letter, it\r\nreceived no special attention from the Post Office. If gold or silver\r\nwas sent in a letter marked \"money letter,\" the postmaster placed it in\r\na separate envelope and made a special entry on the way bill, which was\r\nrepeated at every office it passed through. No special fee was charged\r\nfor the extra attention bestowed upon these letters until 1835 when the\r\nPostmaster-General was allowed to charge a fee for their registration in\r\naddition to the ordinary postage.[201] The Money Order Department, still\r\na private undertaking, had its fees reduced from 6_d._ to 3_d._ on sums\r\nnot exceeding £2 and from 18_d._ to 6_d._ on sums exceeding £2 but not\r\nmore than £5.[202]\r\n\r\n[200] _Rep. Commrs._, 1837, xxxiv, 8th rep., app., no. 3.\r\n\r\n[201] _London Times_, 1832, Apr. 27, p. 3; 5 and 6 Wm. IV, c. 25; 3 and\r\n4 Vict., c. 96.\r\n\r\n[202] London _Times_, 1837, Jan. 26, p. 5; Dec. 13, p. 4; _Acc. & P._,\r\n1841, xxvi, 221, no. 6.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the General Post was being reformed, a former\r\nletter carrier by the name of Johnson was improving the Penny Post. The\r\nsix principal receiving-houses which Dockwra had instituted had been\r\nreduced to five and were now still further reduced to two. The\r\nsubsidiary receiving-houses in the shops and coffee-houses were\r\nincreased and the number of letter carriers more than doubled. Six\r\nregular deliveries for the city proper and three for the suburbs were\r\nintroduced. Before 1793 the deliveries in the city had not been made at\r\nthe same time, for the carriers had to go to one of the main\r\nreceiving-houses to get their letters. The deliveries were now made as\r\nnear the same time as possible all over the city and the delivery hours\r\nwere posted so that people might know when to expect the carriers and\r\nthus act as a check upon them. Mounted messengers conveyed the letters\r\nto those carriers who delivered in distant parts of the city.[203]\r\n\r\n[203] Joyce, p. 302; _Fin. Rep._, 1797, no. 7, p. 83.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 an act was passed \"to regulate the postage and conveyance of\r\nletters by the carriage called the Penny Post.\" The rate for letters\r\nposted in London, Westminster, Southwark and the suburbs for any place\r\nwithin these places and their suburbs remained one penny. Letters sent\r\nfrom these places to any place outside paid 2_d._ as before. Hitherto\r\nletters sent from outside to London, Westminster, Southwark and the\r\nsuburbs had paid only one penny. This was raised by the act of 1794 to\r\n2_d._ It was also provided that the postage for Penny Post letters need\r\nnot be paid in advance. This would increase the expense but the idea was\r\nprobably to secure greater safety in the delivery of letters. Finally,\r\nthe surplus revenue at the end of each quarter was to be considered part\r\nof the revenue of the General Post.[204]\r\n\r\n[204] 34 Geo. III, c. 17.\r\n\r\nThe changes introduced by Johnson and the act of 1794 were in the right\r\ndirection. This seems a reasonable conclusion not so much on account of\r\nthe increase in net product, which was not great, as on account of the\r\nincrease in gross product, showing that the number of letters and\r\nparcels sent by the Penny Post had doubled. The financial condition of\r\nthe Penny Post before and after the reform is shown by the following\r\nfigures:--\r\n\r\n         _Average Yearly_  _Average Yearly_  _Average Yearly_\r\n          _Gross Product_      _Expense_      _Net Product_\r\n\r\n  1790-1794  £11,089             £5289            £6000\r\n  1795-1797  £26,283           £18,960            £7323[205]\r\n\r\n[205] _Parl. Papers_, 1812-13, _Rep. Com._, ii, p. 94.\r\n\r\nLondon was not the only place which could boast a Penny Post in 1793.\r\nThe system was extended in that year to Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol,\r\nand Birmingham, while Dublin had been so favoured since 1773. It is\r\nalmost unnecessary to add that in all these places, it was a pronounced\r\nsuccess from a financial and social point of view.[206]\r\n\r\n[206] Joyce, pp. 196, 300.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 the London Penny Post which had lasted for 120 years was\r\npractically swept out of existence, for 2_d._ was then charged where a\r\npenny had formerly been the rate. An exception was made in the case of\r\nletters passing first by the General Post, for on these the old rate\r\nstill held.[207] Four years later, the limits of the Twopenny Post, as\r\nit was called, were restricted to the General Post Delivery and 3_d._\r\nwas charged for letters crossing the bounds of this delivery. This was\r\ncalled the Threepenny Post.[208] The effect of the increased rates and\r\nthe growth of population in the metropolis is shown by the increase in\r\ngross receipts, which rose from £11,768 in 1703 to £96,089 in 1816 and\r\nto £105,052 in 1823. During the same period, the number of letter\r\ncarriers was increased from 181 to 235, and nineteen officials were\r\nadded to the establishment.[209]\r\n\r\n[207] 41 Geo. III, c. 7.\r\n\r\n[208] 45 Geo. III, c. 11.\r\n\r\n[209] _Acc. & P._, 1817, pp. 15, 16; _Rep. Commrs._, 1829, xi, pp. 10,\r\n136.\r\n\r\nAlthough the General, the Twopenny, and the Threepenny Posts, were all\r\nunder one management, no attempt was made to harmonize their methods of\r\nprocedure until 1831. Letters for the General Post were often entrusted\r\nto the Twopenny Post but the receiving-houses of both Posts were\r\nfrequently established in the same street and close together. The\r\nGeneral Post had seventy receiving-houses in the city, the Twopenny Post\r\n209, the Threepenny Post 200 more in the suburbs and adjoining country.\r\nIn addition there were 110 \"bellmen\" who collected letters from door to\r\ndoor, ringing their bells as they went. They charged one penny for each\r\nletter collected.[210] The General Post receiving-houses closed at 7\r\nP.M., the Twopenny receiving-houses at 8 P.M., but letters might be\r\nposted at the Charing Cross Office until 8.30 and at the General Office\r\nuntil 9 P.M.[211] At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were\r\nthree deliveries, by the Inland, Foreign, and Twopenny Post carriers.\r\nThe limits of the Inland Post Delivery were very irregular and left out\r\na large part of the populous suburbs. The Foreign Post Delivery was also\r\nvery irregular and still more restricted in area. The Twopenny Post\r\nDelivery included London, Westminster, Southwark and their suburbs, and\r\nwas the most extensive. Letters were delivered by the Threepenny Post\r\nwithin an irregular area bounded on the inside by the Twopenny Delivery\r\nand extending nearly twelve miles from the General Post Office. The\r\nseparate delivery of foreign letters was abolished first and all foreign\r\nletters were delivered by the General Post carriers, and in 1831 the\r\ndeliveries of the General and Twopenny Posts were made co-extensive,\r\nextending to a distance of three miles from the General Office at St.\r\nMartin's-le-Grand. Three years later the Twopenny Post building in\r\nGerard Street was given up and all Twopenny Post letters henceforth were\r\nsent to the General Post Office building to be sorted.[212]\r\n\r\n[210] _Rep.

Deliveries were made at the same hours\r\nin the morning, at noon, and at 2, 4 and 7 o'clock in the afternoon. A\r\nletter posted at or before 8 A.M. was sent for delivery at 10 A.M. and\r\nso on. The letters collected were taken to the General Office by\r\nhorsemen to be sorted. Two sets of men were employed, one collecting\r\nwhile the other delivered.[213] There was an additional \"early delivery\"\r\nas it was called. The carriers on the way to their own \"walks\"\r\ndelivered letters to subscribers, who paid 5_s._ a quarter for the\r\naccommodation thus afforded. The postage for letters so delivered was\r\nnot paid until the carriers called again on their regular delivery.[214]\r\nIn 1837 the times of the regular deliveries were changed to every second\r\nhour from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. and collections were made at the same\r\nhours.[215] In the Threepenny Post limits, there were on an average\r\nthree deliveries a day but those towns which had a General Post delivery\r\nreceived only two a day from the Threepenny Post. Letters were sent by\r\nhorsemen or mail carts for delivery. The same receiving-houses were used\r\nfor General and Threepenny Post letters.[216]\r\n\r\n[213] _Ibid._, 1837, xxxiv, 9th rep., app., no. 1; London _Times_, 1835,\r\nJan. 24, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[214] _Rep.

The deliveries, which had\r\nbeen only two a day, were increased to four and then to six, additional\r\nletter carriers were appointed and receiving-houses established. The\r\npenny delivery extended to four miles around the city. There was a 2_d._\r\nrate for letters beyond the four mile radius.[217] Previous to 1835, the\r\nboundary of the Edinburgh Penny Post was a circle with a radius of 1-3/8\r\nmiles from the Register Office. Some Scotch mathematician must have been\r\nconsulted when in 1835 the boundary was made an ellipse with its foci a\r\nfurlong apart, the distance from each focus to the most remote part of\r\nthe circumference being 1-5/16 miles. Outside this ellipse, there was a\r\n2_d._ rate. There had been three deliveries a day, raised in 1838 to\r\nfive.[218]\r\n\r\n[217] _Ibid._, 1829, xii, p. 73; 7 Wm.

It was pointed out by\r\nthe commissioners in the Report of 1837 that a large proportion of these\r\nletters might be forwarded by the post coaches.[220] If they arrived on\r\nSaturday morning they were not forwarded until Monday evening since\r\nSunday was not a mail day and mail coaches arriving on Sunday were\r\ndetained in the outskirts of the city.[221] The rumour that the Post\r\nOffice was considering the expedience of a Sunday Post brought forth a\r\nflood of protests. Bankers, merchants, vestries, and religious societies\r\nwere represented by delegations and petitions to the Postmaster-General\r\nand the House of Commons, praying that no change might be made.[222]\r\nSixteen hundred solicitors joined in the opposition. Lord Melbourne\r\ninformed the Bishop of London that the subject was not under\r\nconsideration, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer told Sir Robert\r\nInglis that the Government had no intention of opening the Post Office\r\non Sunday.[223] Derby had a Sunday delivery in 1839, but, on their own\r\nrequest, many of the inhabitants were excluded from it.[224]\r\n\r\n[220] _Ibid._, 1837, xxxiv, 7th rep., p. 7, and app., nos. 46, 47, 48.\r\n\r\n[221] _Acc. & P._, 1837, l. 316.\r\n\r\n[222] _Ibid._, 1837, xlvi, 176.\r\n\r\n[223] _Parl.

Before\r\n1797 a penny a mile was paid each way but on the imposition of a tax on\r\ncarriages, the rate was raised to 1-1/2_d._, then to 1-3/4_d._, and\r\nlater to 2-1/8_d._ a mile. One contractor supplied the coaches, others\r\nprovided horses and drivers, but the guards were hired directly by the\r\nPost Office. In Scotland and Ireland, coaches, horses, and drivers were\r\nall provided by the same men. The number of miles a day covered by the\r\nmail-coaches in 1827 was 7862 and the mileage allowance for that year\r\nwas £46,900. When the mails were exceptionally heavy, mail carts were\r\nused, which cost somewhat more than the coaches, since they carried no\r\npassengers. In 1836 the contract for the supply of coaches was thrown\r\nopen to public competition. By this move, the expenses dropped from\r\n£61,009 a year to £53,191 although the total distance travelled per day\r\nincreased from 13,148 to 14,482 miles.[225] The mail-coaches were at a\r\ndisadvantage in competing with the post-coaches, since the former were\r\nallowed to carry no more than four inside and two outside passengers\r\nnor were they allowed to carry any luggage on the roof.[226] On the\r\nother hand the mail-coaches in England paid no tolls until 1837.[227]\r\nThe 268 mail guards of the British coaches received £7577 in salaries in\r\n1837, paid directly by the Post Office. Seven inspectors were also\r\nemployed at a fixed yearly salary and 15_s._ a day when travelling. They\r\nsuperintended the coachmen and guards, investigated complaints, delays,\r\nand accidents, and made preliminary agreements in contracting for\r\ncoaches.[228] The majority of the Irish coaches had paid tolls ever\r\nsince they had been introduced. Generally they were paid by the Post\r\nOffice at stated intervals. The total distance travelled by mail-coaches\r\nin Ireland in 1829 was 2160 miles each day, by mail-carts 2533 miles.\r\nThe number of guards employed was eighty-five, receiving £2935 a year.\r\nThe Irish coaches were allowed to carry four outside passengers.[229]\r\n\r\n[225] _Parl.

In 1838 the Government paid the Grand\r\nJunction Railway 5-7/8_d._ a single mile for the conveyance of its\r\nmails. At the same time the average rate by the coaches was 2-1/8_d._ a\r\nsingle mile. On the London and Birmingham Railway when a special Post\r\nOffice carriage was used, 7-1/2_d._ was paid. When the ordinary\r\nmail-coach was carried on trucks the rate was 4-1/4_d._ When a regular\r\nrailway carriage was used, the rate was 2-1/2_d._ a mile for one third\r\nof a carriage.[230] For the year ending 5th January, 1839, the Post\r\nOffice paid £105,107 for the conveyance of mails by coaches and £9883 to\r\nthe railways. For the next official year, the figures had risen to\r\n£109,246 and £39,724.[231]\r\n\r\n[230] _Ibid._, 1837, xxxiv, 7th rep., app., nos. 12, 13.

The number of persons employed in the\r\nGeneral Office in 1804 was 486. In 1814 there were 576. There were 563\r\npostmasters in England and over 3000 persons officially engaged in the\r\nreceipt and delivery of letters. Additional offices had also been\r\nestablished. In 1813 a Returned Letter Office was organized for the\r\npurpose of returning undelivered letters to the writers and collecting\r\nthe postage due. Previous to 1813, the practice had been to return only\r\nsuch letters as appeared to contain money or were supposed to be\r\nimportant enough to escape destruction. A Franking Department was\r\norganized to inspect such letters as were sent free. The increased use\r\nof private ships for conveying letters led to the establishment of a\r\nShip Letter Office.[232]\r\n\r\n[232] _Parl. Papers_, 1813-14, _Rep. Com._, p. 35; _Acc. & P._, 1817,\r\npp. 4-16; _Rep. Commrs._, 1829, xi, p. 137.\r\n\r\nThe old Post Office building in Lombard Street was quite too small to\r\nprovide for the new offices and employees. The Inland Department\r\ncontained only 3140 superficial feet, half of which was occupied with\r\nsorting tables, leaving only 1500 feet for 130 persons. In the Foreign\r\nDepartment with thirty-five men, there were only 250 superficial feet\r\nwhere they must perform their duties. The accommodations for receiving\r\nletters were so inadequate that when a foreign mail was being made up,\r\nthe windows were crowded with an impatient and seething mob waiting for\r\ntheir turn to post their letters. The condition of the Penny Post\r\nDepartment was no better. In 1814 a committee of the House of Commons\r\nreported that a new General Post Office building was absolutely\r\nnecessary. Objections were raised on account of the necessary expenses\r\ninvolved and it was not until 1829 that the new Post Office in St.\r\nMartin's-le-Grand was formally opened.[233]\r\n\r\n[233] _Parl. Papers_, 1813-14, _Rep. Com._, pp. 11-16.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 Ireland was given much larger political powers than she had\r\npreviously enjoyed, and her Parliament was freed from the direct\r\ntutelage of the English Privy Council. At the same time greater latitude\r\nin postal matters was also granted. An Irish Postmaster-General was\r\nappointed to reside in Dublin and to collect the postage on all letters\r\nwhich did not pass beyond Ireland. The postage between the two countries\r\nwas to be collected on delivery, and then to be divided between the two\r\naccording to the distance travelled in each. All net receipts from the\r\nIrish Office were ordered to be transmitted to London. The sailing\r\npackets remained in the charge of the English Postmasters-General, but\r\n£4000 a year was paid to the Irish Office for this privilege.[234]\r\n\r\n[234] 24 Geo. III, c. 6.\r\n\r\nAfter the separation of the Irish from the English Post Office,\r\ndifferent postage rates had been established for the two countries. The\r\ndivision of authority thus established had caused endless difficulties.\r\nComplaints about the delay or loss of letters crossing the Channel at\r\nKingstown, Howth, and Waterford were referred from one office to the\r\nother. The Commissioners who inquired into the condition of the Dublin\r\nOffice found things in a deplorable condition. There were nearly as many\r\npostal officials employed in Dublin as in London, although the number of\r\nletters handled was not one fourth so great. In the secretary's office,\r\nemploying six persons, the fees amounted to £2648 a year, largely on\r\nEnglish and Irish newspapers. In the whole Dublin establishment they\r\naveraged over £15,000 a year. The contracts for the supply and horsing\r\nof the mail-coaches were supposed to be public but they were awarded by\r\nfavour. The Postmasters-General did not attend to business and were very\r\njealous of each other. The Commissioners recommended the amalgamation of\r\nthe English and Irish offices, and this was accomplished in 1831, the\r\nIrish postage rates having been altered four years earlier to coincide\r\nwith the English rates.[235]\r\n\r\n[235] _Rep. Commrs._, 1829, xii, 253, pp. 7, 8, 15-84; _ibid._, 1837,\r\n7th rep., app. nos. 22, 68; 7 and 8 Geo. IV, c. 21.\r\n\r\nIreland was divided into eight postal divisions, according to the routes\r\nof the mail-coaches. Mails left Dublin at 7 A.M. with an additional mail\r\nfor Cork at noon. They arrived in Dublin between 6 and 7 A.M. The most\r\nimportant postal centres in addition to Dublin were Belfast, Cork,\r\nLimerick, and the packet stations at Waterford and Donaghadee. The total\r\nnumber of post towns in Ireland was 414. At the same time there were in\r\nGreat Britain 546 post towns.[236] A new post office building was\r\ncompleted in Dublin in 1821 at a cost of £107,000.[237]\r\n\r\n[236] _Rep. Commrs._, 1829, xii, 253, pp. 7, 8; 1831-32, xvii, p. 325.\r\n\r\n[237] 48 Geo. III, c. 48; _Parl. Papers_, 1821, xix, 286.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch Post Office had been amalgamated with the English Office in\r\n1711, and Scotland was constituted one of the eighteen postal divisions\r\nof Great Britain. The Scotch rates had been the same as the English\r\nrates since that date, although an additional half-penny was paid on\r\nScotch letters to meet mail-coach tolls. In 1821 there were only eight\r\ntowns for which mails were made up. At the same time that a new building\r\nfor the use of the Post Office was being erected in Dublin, a contract\r\nwas signed for a new General Office building for Edinburgh to cost\r\n£14,000.[238]\r\n\r\n[238] _Rep. Commrs._, 1829, xii, 353, p. 8; _Parl. Papers_, 1821, xxi,\r\n423.\r\n\r\nThe rates established by the act of 1765 were still unchanged for the\r\ncolonial possessions of the United Kingdom. The American dominions had\r\nbeen sadly depleted by the Revolutionary War but the postage revenue\r\nfrom the loyal remnants had steadily increased. In 1838 the amount of\r\npostage charged upon the colonial postmasters in America amounted to\r\n£79,000. At one time Jamaica had been the most important American colony\r\nfrom a postal point of view. Canada now took the lead, followed in order\r\nof importance by Jamaica, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. In 1834 it was\r\nprovided that, as soon as the North American Provinces passed postal\r\nacts of their own and these acts were approved by the King, the colonial\r\nrates of 1765 should cease and the net postal revenue of the North\r\nAmerican Provinces should be retained by them.[239]\r\n\r\n[239] _Rep. Com._, 1837-38, xx, pts. 1 and 2, 2d rep., app. E, no. 42; 4\r\nand 5 Wm. IV, c. 7.\r\n\r\nThe British Post Office was now to experience the most far reaching and\r\nvital change since 1635. Sir Rowland Hill was the representative of the\r\nmovement, aided by Mr. Wallace, who, as a member of Parliament, was able\r\nto exercise an important effect upon the proposed reform. The history of\r\nthe adoption of penny postage has been so well told by Hill himself that\r\nonly a bare story of its acceptance by Parliament is necessary here. A\r\ncommittee was appointed to report upon the condition of the Post Office,\r\nthe attitude of postal officials and of the public towards the proposed\r\nchange, its effect upon the revenue, and finally to give their own\r\nopinion. This committee examined the Postmaster-General,[240] the\r\nSecretaries and Solicitors of the London, Dublin, and Edinburgh offices,\r\nother officials in the Post Office, the Chairman, Secretary, and\r\nSolicitor of the Board of Stamps and Taxes, Rowland Hill and\r\neighty-three other witnesses from different classes of people, and\r\nobtained many reports from the Post Office. Hill presented his plan to\r\nthe Committee as follows:--\r\n\r\nThat inland letters should pay postage according to weight at the rate\r\nof one penny for each half ounce.[241]\r\n\r\nSuch postage should be paid in advance by means of stamped papers or\r\ncovers.[242]\r\n\r\nAn option might be allowed for a time to pay a penny in advance or 2d.\r\non delivery.[243]\r\n\r\nDay mails should be established on the important lines of\r\ncommunication.[244]\r\n\r\n[240] Since 1823 there had been only one Postmaster-General, as the dual\r\nsystem was abolished in that year.\r\n\r\n[241] _Rep.

This plan was uncertain because the number could not always\r\nbe ascertained, necessitated a close examination, and was evaded by\r\nwriting several letters on one sheet.[246]\r\n\r\n[245] _Ibid._, 1837-38, xx, qs. 114, 11092-97; pt. 1, 3d rep., 708, p.\r\n5; pts. 1 and 2, 2d rep., app. E, no. 58.\r\n\r\n[246] _Ibid._, 1837-38, xx, qs. 3116, 4599, 8137, 9770; 3d rep., p. 44.\r\n\r\nPayment on delivery made it necessary to keep two separate accounts\r\nagainst each postmaster, one for unpaid letters posted in London, and\r\none for paid letters posted in the country. The postmasters had also to\r\nkeep accounts against each other. Payment in advance, if made\r\ncompulsory, would do away with half of these accounts and the use of\r\nstamped covers or paper would do away with the other half.[247] In some\r\nsmall places where the penny charge would not cover the cost of\r\ndelivery, Hill proposed that a small additional charge be made, either\r\nin advance or on delivery, but he withdrew this suggestion later.[248]\r\n\r\n[247] _Ibid._, 1837-38, xx, 3d rep., pp. 35, 38; qs. 113, 620, 621.\r\n\r\n[248] _Ibid._, 1837-38, xx, pt. 1, pp. 48, 59, 424; pts. 1 and 2, 1st\r\nrep., no. 25, p. 508.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses summoned to give their evidence before the committee\r\npointed out that a multitude of business transactions were not carried\r\non at all, or were carried on clandestinely, or were hampered by the\r\nhigh postage rates. Bills for small amounts were not drawn,[249]\r\ncommercial travellers did not write until several orders could be sent\r\non one sheet of paper,[250] samples were not sent by post,[251]\r\ncommunication between banks and their branches was restricted,[252]\r\nstatistical information was denied,[253] social correspondence\r\nrestricted especially among the poor,[254] working men were ignorant of\r\nthe rates of wages in other parts of the country,[255] and the high\r\npostage was a bad means of raising revenue.[256] In order to estimate\r\nthe probable revenue after the change, it was necessary to know the\r\nnumber of letters carried. Hill had come to the conclusion that the\r\ntotal number was about 80,000,000 a year. The Secretary, Maberley,\r\nconsidered that there were about 58,000,000. A return was called for by\r\nthe committee and Hill's estimate proved to be nearly correct.[257]\r\n\r\n[249] _Rep.

Over 300\r\npetitions with 38,000 signatures were presented praying for its\r\nadoption. The Duke of Richmond, a former Postmaster-General, thought\r\nthat it would be beneficial and that it was the only means of stopping\r\nthe illegal conveyance of letters.[259] Sir Robert Peel was of the\r\nopinion that, with the prevailing deficits, it was an unfortunate\r\ndeparture, and he feared that prepaid letters would not be\r\ndelivered.[260] But the Treasury was given power to lower rates and in\r\n1840 a treasury warrant was issued, imposing postage rates between the\r\ncolonies and between foreign countries through Great Britain according\r\nto weight and distance.[261] Stamped covers were issued for the use of\r\nmembers of Parliament, and in 1840 an act was passed establishing penny\r\npostage for the United Kingdom, permitting the use of stamped paper or\r\ncovers, and imposing rates on foreign and colonial letters according to\r\nweight and distance conveyed.[262]\r\n\r\n[259] _Rep.

Can it be that\r\nall my life I have been in error? If I, then others--others whose\r\nbehests I have been bound to obey. To make the Post Office revenue as\r\nproductive as possible was long ago impressed upon me by successive\r\nministers as a duty which I was under a solemn obligation to discharge.\r\nAnd not only long ago. Is it not within the last six months that the\r\npresent Chancellor of the Exchequer[263] has charged me not to let the\r\npresent revenue go down? What! You, Freeling, brought up and educated as\r\nyou have been, are you going to lend yourself to these extravagant\r\nschemes? You with your four-horse mail coaches too! Where else in the\r\nworld does the merchant or the manufacturer have the materials of his\r\ntrade carried for him gratuitously or at so low a rate as to leave no\r\nmargin of profit?\"[264]\r\n\r\n[263] The Rt. Hon. Thomas Spring Rice.\r\n\r\n[264] Joyce, pp. 427-28.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE POSTAL ESTABLISHMENT AN INSTRUMENT OF POPULAR COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the inauguration of inland penny postage the Postal Establishment\r\nceased to exist primarily as a tax-collecting agency, and, although\r\nmaintained as a whole upon a paying basis, certain of its recent\r\nexperiments have, from a financial point of view, been far from\r\nsuccessful. On the other hand, the simultaneous unification and\r\nreduction of rates, together with various other changes which have been\r\nadopted since 1840, have resulted in lessening appreciably the expenses\r\nof management.\r\n\r\nThe postage on inland letters was reduced in 1865, 1871, 1884, and again\r\nin 1897. In 1839, the last year of high postal rates, the total number\r\nof letters, including franks, delivered in the United Kingdom, was\r\nsomewhat in excess of eighty-two millions. This number was rather more\r\nthan doubled in the following year. During the ensuing ten years the\r\nfigures were again doubled, the total in 1850 being 347 millions. For\r\nthe five-year period 1866-70, following the reduction in postage of\r\n1865, the average yearly number delivered was 800 millions. In 1875 this\r\nincreased to a little over 1000 millions; in the postal year 1880-81 to\r\n1176 millions, in 1890-91 to 1705 millions, and in 1900-01 to 2323\r\nmillions.[265] So far as colonial letters were concerned, a marked\r\nreduction in rates was granted soon after inland penny postage was\r\nobtained, the reduction being extended to the larger part of the\r\nEmpire.[266] Further reductions followed until, in 1898, a penny half\r\nounce rate was established for most of the colonies, and all were\r\nincluded in 1905. As on a previous occasion, the United States was the\r\nfirst foreign country with which an agreement was made to adopt this low\r\nrate, and its advantages have been enhanced still further by an\r\nincrease in the initial weight from half an ounce to an ounce. During\r\nthe sixties, treaties were entered into with the most important European\r\ncountries for lower postage rates, and, in 1874, at the first meeting of\r\nthe Postal Union, a uniform rate for prepaid letters of 2-1/2_d._ a half\r\nounce was agreed to. Reductions also followed for other postal matter.\r\nIn 1891 a universal foreign letter rate of 2-1/2_d._ was announced so\r\nfar as the United Kingdom was concerned, with the exception of those\r\ncountries where a lower rate already prevailed, and a further reduction\r\nfollowed in 1907 by increasing the initial weight from half an ounce to\r\nan ounce in the case of all foreign and colonial letters, the charge on\r\nforeign letters for each unit after the first being reduced at the same\r\ntime from 2-1/2_d._ to 1-1/2_d._\r\n\r\n[265] _Rep. P. G._, 1855, p. 65; 1881, app., p. 11; 1891, app., p. 16;\r\n1901, app., p. 25.\r\n\r\n[266] Colonial legislatures were given the power in 1849 to establish\r\nposts of their own and to fix the inland postal rates (12 and 13 Vict.,\r\nc. 26).\r\n\r\nAfter 1840 the registration fee was reduced by a series of gradations\r\nfrom 1_s._ to 2_d._, and the compulsory registration of all letters\r\ncontaining coin was enforced. In 1891 the separate system of insurance\r\nwas abolished, and registration was extended for the first time to\r\ninland parcels. The limit of compensation was increased at the same time\r\nto £25 and in the following year to £50 by the payment of 2_d._ for the\r\nfirst £5 and an additional penny for each additional £5 of\r\ninsurance.[267] Seven years later the amount of compensation payable was\r\nincreased to £120 and the fee payable was lowered for all sums over £15.\r\nArrangements were also made by which letters addressed to certain\r\ncolonies and foreign countries might be insured to the same maximum\r\namount.[268] The limit of compensation is now £400 for inland registered\r\ncorrespondence as well as for correspondence to many foreign countries\r\nand a few of the colonies.\r\n\r\n[267] _Rep.

He pointed out that this would\r\ngreatly simplify the keeping of accounts by the department and increase\r\nthe net revenue. The proposition was, however, too unpopular to secure\r\napproval. Nevertheless in 1847 the Postmaster-General secured\r\nparliamentary authority to abolish or restrict payment in money and\r\nrequire stamps to be used, but the experiment proved so unpopular that\r\nit was eventually abandoned.[269] The use of perforated stamps, an\r\ninvention of Mr. Archer, was in 1852 recommended by a committee\r\nappointed to report on the question.[270] Finally, in 1904, the law\r\nforbidding the use of embossed or impressed stamps cut out of envelopes,\r\npostcards, letter cards, wrappers, and telegraph forms was\r\nrepealed.[271]\r\n\r\n[269] 10 and 11 Vict., c. 85; _Rep. Com._, 1852, xv, 386, p. 150; _Rep.\r\nP. G._, 1859, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[270] _Rep. Com._, 1852, xv, 386, pp. iii-iv.\r\n\r\n[271] 4 Edw. VII, c. 14.\r\n\r\nFrom 1808 to 1840 the rural districts as a rule obtained their postal\r\nmatter by a special payment on their part to messengers for its\r\nconveyance from the nearest town, sometimes aided by a bonus from the\r\nrevenue, or by means of the \"fifth-clause\" posts,[272] or by the penny\r\nposts which were constantly increasing in number and were occasionally\r\nestablished under guarantee. In 1838 there were fifty-two \"fifth-clause\"\r\nposts in England and Wales, and 1922 villages in the United Kingdom were\r\nserved by penny posts. In 1843 the government of Sir Robert Peel laid\r\ndown the following principle: \"All places the letters for which exceed\r\none hundred per week should be entitled to a receiving office and a free\r\ndelivery of letters.\" A \"delivery\" here meant a daily delivery, and the\r\nboundary of the free delivery was to be determined by the\r\nPostmaster-General. The principle enunciated above was followed until\r\n1850, and during that period the increase in the number of free and\r\nguaranteed rural deliveries was very great. At the close of this period\r\nit was decided that in future the determining rule should be based upon\r\nthe probability of financial success. A post was held to pay its way\r\nwhenever its cost was covered by a halfpenny on each letter delivered,\r\nbut, since it was held that the number of letters would be doubled by\r\nfree delivery, double the number arriving before its establishment might\r\nbe assumed to arrive afterward. The post might be bi-weekly, tri-weekly,\r\nor weekly. This rule was to a certain extent made retroactive, but no\r\npost established under the rule of 1843 was stopped so long as the cost\r\nwas covered by calculating delivered letters at a penny each. It was\r\ndecided in 1853 that a post less frequent than once a day might be\r\nincreased in frequency whenever the cost would be covered by a revenue\r\nestimated on the basis of three farthings for each letter, and in\r\ntreating an application for a second daily post this amount was to be\r\nreduced to one farthing. The experiment was tried of delivering letters\r\nat every house in a few selected places but did not prove a success. It\r\nwas stated that at the end of this revision, 93 per cent of all postal\r\npackets were delivered. In 1860 the rule was laid down that new posts\r\nshould be set up only when the cost would be covered by half a penny on\r\neach letter actually arriving, the old rule having been found to be too\r\nliberal. Two years later it was stated by the Post Office that only 6\r\nper cent of the total postal packages were undelivered. In 1882 the\r\nquestion of extending the rural posts was considered by Mr. Fawcett, the\r\nthen Postmaster-General, who decided that credit should be given for\r\nrevenue by increasing the halfpenny to 6/10_d._ for each letter, and in\r\nthe next year the existing rule as to a second daily delivery was made\r\nmore liberal. In 1890, for places hitherto unserved, the rate per letter\r\nfor estimating revenue was increased to three farthings, for each parcel\r\nthe rate was fixed at 1-1/2_d._, and in the following year rural\r\nsanitary authorities in England and Wales were authorized to guarantee\r\nposts. In Scotland the district committee or the county council, where\r\nthe counties were not divided, was given the same power in 1892. In the\r\nsame year the rule was laid down that a second service in the day might\r\nbe given provided that its cost did not exceed half a penny a letter and\r\na penny a parcel and in addition that the total cost of night and day\r\nmail services should not exceed the revenue from the whole\r\ncorrespondence at half a penny per letter and a penny per parcel. It was\r\nestimated in 1892 that about thirty-two and a half millions of letters\r\nwere undelivered, but the work of extending the rural posts went on\r\ngradually until in 1897 it was announced that provision would be made as\r\nsoon as possible for delivery to every house in the United Kingdom. In\r\n1900 the Postmaster-General was able to report that house to house\r\ndelivery had been completed in England and almost completed in Scotland\r\nand Ireland.[273]\r\n\r\n[272] Established by agreements between the Postmaster-General and the\r\ninhabitants of small towns and villages.\r\n\r\n[273] _Rep. P. G._, 1898, pp. 32-39; 1860, pp. 9 f.; 1864, p. 15.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ordinary delivery at regular intervals there was a\r\ngrowing demand for a more rapid service on extraordinary occasions as\r\nwell as a desire for a special messenger service when the use of the\r\nPost Office as a medium meant an undesirable loss of time. In 1886 a\r\nprivate company started to supply messengers for postal services. After\r\nsome trouble with the Post Office, a licence was granted them in 1891 in\r\nreturn for which they agreed to pay a percentage of their gross receipts\r\nto the department and observe certain conditions with reference to the\r\ndelivery of letters.[274] An express delivery service was also\r\nestablished by the Post Office, the fee in addition to the ordinary\r\npostage being 2_d._ for the first mile, 3_d._ for the second and beyond\r\nthat, and where no public conveyances existed, 1_s._ a mile or actual\r\ncab-fare. In the case of letters delivered locally the ordinary postage\r\nwas abrogated soon after and a charge of 1-1/2_d._ per pound for parcels\r\nexceeding one pound in weight was imposed, but this charge was later\r\nlowered to a penny per pound with a maximum payment of 1_s._ and the\r\nmaximum limit of weight was increased from 15 to 20 pounds where the\r\nmessenger could travel by public conveyance. The initial charge for the\r\nfirst mile of 2_d._, and 3_d._ for each succeeding mile, for each parcel\r\nwas made a uniform charge of 3_d._ per mile, and the fixed charge of\r\n2_d._ for each parcel beyond the first was reduced to a penny where\r\nseveral packets were tendered by the same sender for delivery by the\r\nsame messenger. In the case of several packages delivered at the same\r\naddress the charge was lowered to 3_d._ plus an additional penny for\r\nevery ten packages or part thereof, later changed to a weight fee of\r\n3_d._ on each packet or bundle of packets weighing more than one\r\npound.[275] Rural postmen were also allowed to receive letters and\r\nparcels from the public at any point in their walks and deliver them\r\nwithout passing them through a post office, having first canceled the\r\nstamps.[276] An agreement was also made with the railways to carry\r\nsingle letters left in the booking office for 2_d._ each. These letters\r\nmay be taken to the booking office by messenger and delivered by a\r\nmessenger at the end of their journey or posted there.[277] The express\r\ndelivery service was also extended to such foreign countries as would\r\nagree to it, including nearly all of Western Europe, part of South\r\nAmerica, and the far East. In every case the primary fee in England is\r\n_3d._, the foreign charges varying with local conditions. Express\r\nletters from abroad are delivered free within one mile from the Post\r\nOffice. Beyond that the distance charge is 3_d._ a mile for one parcel,\r\nwith a penny for each additional parcel delivered to the same person.\r\nThe Postmaster-General reported that the establishment of this service\r\nwas not only much appreciated by the people, but was self-supporting and\r\neven profitable to the state. During the ten year period ending March\r\n31, 1901, the number of express delivery services in the United Kingdom\r\nincreased from 108,000 to 804,000.[278]\r\n\r\n[274] Their extended licence will expire in 1922 (_Rep.

After this stamp ceased to be compulsory,\r\nnewspapers which bore it passed free from other postage until 1870--when\r\nthe halfpenny rate was established--and were known as \"free\"[279] as\r\ndistinguished from \"chargeable\" newspapers. Of the former there were\r\ncarried by post in 1856 over 53 millions, of the latter, including book\r\npackets, 20 millions. In 1875 the number of newspapers delivered in the\r\nUnited Kingdom had increased to 121 millions. For the five year period\r\nending March 31, 1881, the average yearly number had increased to a\r\nlittle over 129 millions, for the next five years to something over 142\r\nmillions. During the period ending March 31, 1891, they had increased to\r\n155 millions, there being an actual decrease in one year. In the period\r\nfollowing there was an average yearly increase of only three millions\r\nand the ensuing five years ending March 31, 1901, showed a decrease of\r\nabout one million.[280]\r\n\r\n[279] Free newspapers also included those coming from abroad on which no\r\ncharge was made in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n[280] _Rep. P.

In 1892 its scope was\r\ngreatly enlarged and the expression Halfpenny Post, which is now its\r\nofficial name, better illustrates its cosmopolitan character for it now\r\nincludes all printed documents of a conventional, formal, or impersonal\r\ncharacter. From 1872 to 1875 the number of articles carried by the\r\nHalfpenny or Book Post increased from 114 millions to 158 millions. The\r\nyearly average during the next five years was 204 millions; during the\r\nfollowing five, 305 millions and for the five year period ending March\r\n31, 1891, they had increased to 418 millions. During the next five years\r\nthere was a still greater average increase to 596 millions and the\r\naverage for the postal year ending in March, 1901, was 732\r\nmillions.[281] The rates for the Inland Pattern and Sample Post,\r\nestablished in 1863, were assimilated with those of the Book Post in\r\n1870. It was abolished or rather incorporated with the Letter Post in\r\nthe following year but was reëstablished in 1887, the rates being a\r\npenny for the first four ounces and 1/2_d._ for each succeeding two\r\nounces, but, when the Jubilee letter rates were published, it lost its\r\n_raison d'être_ and was abolished for inland purposes.[282]\r\n\r\n[281] _Rep. P.

Somewhat later reply post cards were issued for the inland\r\nservice and arrangements were made for the use of international reply\r\npost cards. In 1894, private post cards, to which a halfpenny stamp was\r\naffixed, were allowed to pass by post. The resulting enormous\r\ngrowth[284] in their number showed that the privilege was appreciated.\r\nIn less than five years they were estimated to form 5 per cent of the\r\ntotal number passing through the post.[285] Shortly after, the\r\nprohibition of any writing save the address on the face of a post card\r\nwas withdrawn and it was provided that the address side of all mail\r\nmatter might be used for purposes of correspondence provided that it did\r\nnot obscure the address, encroach upon the stamp, or prove in any way\r\ninconvenient. Formerly, so far as mail matter other than post cards was\r\nconcerned, the right half of the face side was reserved for the\r\naddress.[286] During the four five-year periods from 1881 to the year\r\nending 31st March, 1901, the average numbers of post cards delivered\r\nyearly in the United Kingdom were about 108 millions, 152 millions, 272\r\nmillions, and 379 millions.[287]\r\n\r\n[283] Charge on unpaid inland post cards reduced to 1_d._ each in 1896.\r\n\r\n[284] They increased from 248 millions for the postal year 1893-94 to\r\n312 millions during the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n[285] _Rep.

Such was the case, however, with reference\r\nto the adoption of the convenient post card and the no less useful\r\nparcel post. In 1880 the question of the establishment of an\r\ninternational parcel post was discussed in Paris and an agreement was\r\nreached for the transmission throughout nearly the whole of Europe of\r\nparcels not exceeding three kilogrammes in weight. It was impossible for\r\nGreat Britain to sign, as she had no inland parcel post at the time and\r\nfound it difficult to establish one as an agreement with the railways\r\nwas necessary. A movement was at once begun for one and it was started\r\nthree years later. The first despatch of foreign and colonial parcels\r\ntook place in 1885, and at the beginning of the following year\r\narrangements were completed for the exchange of parcels with\r\ntwenty-seven different countries, including some of the colonies, India,\r\nand Egypt. An agreement was concluded in 1904 with the United States for\r\nthe interchange of parcels by post at the rate of 2_s._ for each and the\r\nmaximum is two kilogrammes. These cannot be insured and customs' duties\r\nmust be paid by the recipient. The previously existing agreement for\r\nparcels weighing as much as eleven pounds each, providing for insurance\r\nand the prepayment of customs' duties, continues to be carried on by the\r\nAmerican Express Company.[288] Since the establishment of the inland\r\nparcel post the question of collecting the value of the parcels on\r\ndelivery, if the sender and the recipient so desire, has often been\r\nraised. Owing to the opposition of retail dealers, it has not yet been\r\nadopted although in operation in India and nearly all important foreign\r\ncountries. In the words of the Postmaster-General--\"In these\r\ncircumstances I am by no means satisfied, so far as my enquiries have\r\ngone, that the apprehensions expressed by retail traders in this country\r\nafford sufficient cause for withholding a convenience from the community\r\nat large.\"[289]\r\n\r\n[288] _Ibid._, 1881, p. 4; 1885, p. 4; 1886, p. 5; 1895, p. 21; 1905, p.\r\n7; _The Economist_, 1881, Nov. 5, p. 1369; 1882, July 29, p. 939.\r\n\r\n[289] _Rep. P. G._, 1904, pp. 4-5.\r\n\r\nThe various changes and improvements adopted by the Post Office since\r\n1840, in addition to those already named, are so numerous that only the\r\nmost important can be considered here. Among others the amalgamation of\r\nthe London District Post with the General Post in 1854 deserves\r\nattention. In the following year it was ordered that letters should be\r\nsorted in each of the ten postal districts into which London was divided\r\ninstead of being taken to the General Office at St. Martin's-le-Grand as\r\nhad been customary, thus materially lessening the expenses of sorting\r\nand facilitating their delivery.[290]\r\n\r\n[290] _Ibid._, 1855, p. 12; 1856, p. 9; 1860, p. 8.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 there were but 4028 post offices in the Kingdom; in 1854,\r\n9973.[291] Road letter boxes were introduced in 1858 and the public\r\nreceptacles for the receipt of letters numbered 13,370 in 1859 as\r\ncompared with 4518 before the establishment of penny postage.[292] In\r\n1829 the total number of persons in England employed in Post Office\r\nbusiness numbered only 5000. Twenty-five years later for the United\r\nKingdom over 21,000 were so employed; in 1880 over 47,000, of whom,\r\nhowever, more than 11,000 were engaged wholly in telegraph duties. By\r\n1890 these had increased to nearly 118,000 and by 1900 to 173,000 of\r\nwhom 35,000 were females.[293]\r\n\r\n[291] _Ibid._, 1855, p. 21.\r\n\r\n[292] _Ibid._, 1855-59.\r\n\r\n[293] _Rep. Commrs._, 1829, ii, p. 137; _Rep. P. G._, 1855, p. 20; 1881,\r\napp., p. 16; 1891, app., pp. 34-35; 1901, app., p. 50.\r\n\r\nThe money order business which originated as a private speculation in\r\n1791 was the result of an attempt to check the frequent theft of letters\r\ncontaining money. In 1838, shortly after its acquisition from the\r\nproprietors, the rates were reduced and the number of money orders\r\ntransmitted increased from 188,000 in 1839 to 587,000 in 1840 and to\r\n1,500,000 in 1842. From the latter date until 1879 the increase both in\r\nthe number and in the value of money orders transmitted was steady,\r\naided by the increase in 1862 from £5 to £10 of the maximum\r\ntransmissible sum and by the reduction in rates in 1871. The penny rate\r\nof that year for orders to the value of ten shillings was a mistake, for\r\nthe actual cost to the state of issuing and paying a money order was\r\nabout 3_d._ In order to meet this difficulty a simpler form of order was\r\nissued in 1881 with an initial rate as low as half a penny, the cost of\r\nwhich to the Post Office was much less than that of the old kind of\r\norder. These postal notes, as they were called, were issued for new\r\ndenominations in 1884 and 1905 and the rates on some of them were\r\ndiminished. The lowest rate for a money order was for a few months fixed\r\nat 3_d._ but, as this aroused considerable opposition, the present rate\r\nof 2_d._ was soon after substituted, and in 1903 the maximum sum\r\ntransmissible was increased to £40 with a few accompanying changes in\r\nrates. In 1889 an opportunity was given in the case of a few towns for\r\nsending telegraphic money orders and during the ensuing three years the\r\nprivileged area was greatly extended. In 1897 the expenses were\r\nconsiderably reduced. In 1858 arrangements were made for the exchange of\r\nmoney orders with Canada and by 1862 similar agreements were decided\r\nupon with most of the other colonies, but foreign countries were not\r\nincluded until somewhat later and in 1880 colonial and foreign rates\r\nwere harmonized. Rates were reduced in 1883, 1896, and 1903, and in the\r\nlast year the inland £40 limit was agreed upon with most foreign\r\ncountries and some of the colonies.\r\n\r\nInland money orders which started to decrease in amount in 1878-79\r\nsteadily continued their downward course until 1891-92, when there was a\r\nslight recovery for a few years, but since 1903-04 the number has\r\nsomewhat diminished. During the postal year ending in March, 1907, the\r\nnumber of inland money orders transmitted was nearly eleven millions as\r\ncompared with nearly nineteen millions for the year ending March, 1879.\r\nThis decrease in numbers is largely due to the lowering of the\r\nregistration fee for letters, the introduction of postal notes, and the\r\nuse of other means for transmitting small sums of money. The total value\r\nof inland money orders also began to diminish in 1879, but began to\r\nrecover in 1886, and has since increased quite uniformly, being in 1907\r\nnearly £38,000,000 as compared with £29,000,000 in 1879.[294] The\r\nincrease in the number of postal notes has been enormous, although there\r\nwas an apparent falling off in the years 1903 and 1904 due to the\r\nincreased number of denominations offered for sale. For the first\r\ncomplete postal year after their authorization the number issued was\r\nnearly four and a half millions of the value of £2,000,000, and for the\r\npostal year 1906-07 the number was 102,000,000 of the value of nearly\r\n£41,000,000.[295] On the other hand, while inland money orders were\r\ndecreasing in number, colonial and foreign orders increased in general\r\nboth in number and value.[296]\r\n\r\n[294] _Rep.

In 1859 the efforts of Mr.\r\nSikes of Huddersfield to bring a Post Office Savings Bank into being\r\nwere supported by Mr. Gladstone, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir\r\nRowland Hill, the then Secretary of the Post Office, and two years later\r\nit was established by Parliamentary sanction.[297] The main features of\r\nthe system were that deposits could be withdrawn not later than ten days\r\nafter demand; that accounts should be kept at London alone, all money\r\nbeing remitted to and from headquarters; that the total amount deposited\r\nshould be handed over to the \"Commissioners for the Reduction of the\r\nNational Debt\" for investment in government securities, and that\r\ninterest on complete pounds at the rate of 2-1/2 per cent should be\r\nallowed to depositors. As the interests of the poorer classes were made\r\nthe primary object in establishing the banks, deposits were limited in\r\nthe case of individuals to £30 a year and £150 in all, later increased\r\nto £50 a year and £200 in all, but Friendly Societies were allowed to\r\ndeposit without limit and Provident and Charitable Societies might\r\ndeposit within limits of £100 a year and £300 in all or, with the\r\nconsent of the Commissioners, beyond these limits.[298]\r\n\r\n[297] 24 Vict., c. 14.\r\n\r\n[298] _Rep. P. G._, 1897, app., pp. 32-36.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the savings banks were made a medium for investing in government\r\nstock at a trifling expense varying from 9_d._ to 2_s._ 3_d._ and with\r\nthe privilege of having dividends collected free from further charge.\r\nThese special advantages were confined to investments from £10 to £100\r\nin value, the latter being the maximum sum in any one year, and the\r\ninvestments themselves might be sums especially deposited or transferred\r\nfrom a depositor's account. In 1887 the minimum amount of stock\r\npurchasable was reduced to 1s., and anyone who had purchased stock\r\nthrough a savings bank might have it transferred to his own name in the\r\nBank of England. In 1893 the limits of investment were raised from £100\r\nto £200 in one year, from £300 to £500 in all, and the Post Office was\r\nempowered to invest in stock any accumulations of ordinary deposits\r\nabove the limit of £200, unless instructions were given by the depositor\r\nto the contrary.\r\n\r\nAn act was passed in 1864 enabling the Postmaster-General to insure the\r\nlives of individuals between the ages of fourteen and sixty for amounts\r\nvarying from £20 to £100. He might also grant annuities, immediate or\r\ndeferred, to any one of ten years of age or upward for sums between £4\r\nand £50. The act came into operation in certain towns of England and\r\nWales in the following year, and the system remained unaltered until\r\n1884. During this period of nineteen years, 7064 policies of insurance\r\nwere effected, representing a yearly average of 372 policies amounting\r\nto an average of £79 each. The contracts for immediate annuities\r\nnumbered 13,402 or an average of 705 a year and there were 978 contracts\r\nfor deferred annuities. The value of immediate annuities granted was\r\n£187,117 and of deferred £19,938, but a part of the latter never came\r\ninto payment as the purchasers were relieved from their bargains upon\r\ntheir own representation.\r\n\r\nA new system associated with Mr. Fawcett's name was prescribed in 1882.\r\nIts merit consisted in linking the annuity and insurance business with\r\nthe Savings Bank Department so that payments for annuities and insurance\r\nare made through deposits in the savings banks. It was further provided\r\nthat for persons between the ages of fourteen and sixty-five the limits\r\nof insurance should be from £5 to £100 and that sums of money might be\r\ninsured payable at the age of sixty or at the expiration of a term of\r\nyears. For annuities the minimum was reduced to £1, the maximum\r\nincreased to £100, and the annuity and insurance privileges were\r\nextended to all places having savings banks. Owing to the necessary\r\npreparation of tables the new regulations did not actually come into\r\noperation until 1884. The growth of life insurance and annuity business\r\nwas slow as compared with the rapid growth of the savings deposits.\r\nIntended, however, primarily for the poor, it has not been without\r\nsuccess, especially as the premiums charged are lower than those of\r\ninsurance companies or industrial societies.[299]\r\n\r\n[299] _Rep. P. G._, 1897, app., pp. 32-38. The insurance and annuity\r\nbusiness of the Post Office has been described by the _Economist_ as a\r\npractical failure because of the government's refusal to solicit\r\nbusiness (_Economist_ 1881, Nov. 5, p. 1369).\r\n\r\nIn addition to joining the insurance and annuity business with the\r\nsavings banks operations, Mr. Fawcett was responsible for a rapid\r\nincrease in the number of branch saving offices in villages, for the\r\nspecial attention paid to \"navvies\" and workmen at their places of\r\nemployment, and above all for the arrangement for making small deposits\r\nby slips of postage stamps. In 1887 by act of Parliament the\r\nPostmaster-General was empowered to offer facilities for the transfer of\r\nmoney from one account to another and for the easier disposal of the\r\nfunds of deceased depositors. In 1891 the maximum permissible deposits\r\nof one person were increased from £150 to £200 inclusive of interest.\r\nThe annual limit remained at £30 but it was provided that, irrespective\r\nof that limit, depositors might replace the amount of any one withdrawal\r\nmade in the same year. Where principal and interest together exceeded\r\n£200, the interest was henceforth to cease on the excess alone, whereas\r\npreviously it had ceased entirely when it had brought an account to\r\n£200. The next development arose from the Free Education Act of 1891 in\r\norder to make it easier for children and parents to save the school\r\npence which they no longer had to pay. Special stamp slips were prepared\r\nto be sold to children, and clerks attended the schools with these\r\nslips. About 1400 schools adopted the scheme at once and three years\r\nlater the number had risen to 3000, but the movement seemed by 1895 to\r\nhave spent its force.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the annual limit of deposits was increased to £50 and, as we\r\nhave already seen in another connection, any accumulations over £200\r\nwere to be invested in Government Stock unless the depositor gave\r\ninstructions to the contrary. In the same year arrangements were made\r\nfor the withdrawal of deposits by telegram. A depositor might telegraph\r\nfor his money and have his warrant sent by return of post at a cost of\r\nabout 9_d._ or the warrant also might be telegraphed to him at a total\r\ncost of about 1_s._ 3_d._ In 1905 a rule was introduced by which a\r\ndepositor, on presentation of his pass-book at any post office doing\r\nsavings bank business, may withdraw on demand not more than £1. This\r\nobviates the expense of telegraphing and, that it was appreciated, is\r\nshown by the fact that during the first six months after the privilege\r\nwas extended there were nearly two millions of \"withdrawals on demand,\"\r\nforming nearly one half of the total number. As a result the number of\r\ntelegraphic withdrawals fell from 227,573 for the postal year 1904-05 to\r\n180,996 for the year 1905-06.[300]\r\n\r\n[300] _Rep. P. G._, 1897, app., pp. 32-36; 1906, pp. 12-13; 56 and 57\r\nVict., c. 59.\r\n\r\nThere has been a steady and pronounced growth in savings bank business\r\nsince its establishment. This growth has shown itself in the increased\r\nnumber of banks, of deposits, and of the total amounts deposited. The\r\naverage amount of each deposit has varied somewhat from £3 6_s._ in 1862\r\nto £2 in 1881, but since this date it has increased slowly but steadily\r\nand in 1901 it stood at £2 14_s._ 2_d._, which is about the average\r\nyearly amount since 1862. At the end of the year 1900 over £135,000,000\r\nwere on deposit in the Post Office savings banks.[301] The increase in\r\namounts invested in government stock has not been by any means so\r\npronounced but there has been an increase. In 1881 we find that nearly\r\n£700,000 were so invested, in 1891 nearly £1,000,000, and in 1900 a\r\nlittle over £1,000,000.[302] So far as annuities are concerned, the\r\nimmediate seem to be considerably more popular than the deferred. The\r\npurchase money receipts for the former were £184,000 in 1881, £296,000\r\nin 1891, and have since increased more rapidly to £728,000 in 1900, with\r\nan actual decrease, however, for the four preceding years. The receipts\r\nfor the purchase of deferred annuities amounted to £5243 in 1881,\r\n£12,578 in 1891 and £14,283 in 1900, also a decrease since 1896. The\r\namounts received as premiums for life insurance policies have also been\r\nrather disappointing, having increased from £10,967 in 1881 to £15,073\r\nin 1891 and to £22,185 in 1900.[303]\r\n\r\n[301] _Ibid._, 1881, app., pp. 32-33; 1891, app., p. 46; 1901, p. 60;\r\n1907, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[302] _Ibid._, 1891, app., p. 47; 1901, app., p. 62.\r\n\r\n[303] _Rep.

So far as the method for ascertaining the rate of\r\npayment was concerned, a difficulty arose as to whether the Post Office\r\nshould pay any part of the tolls as distinguished from operating\r\nexpenses. Major Harness, a Post Office official, stated that in\r\ndiscussing this question with Robert Stephenson in the case of the\r\nLondon and Birmingham Railway it had been agreed that tollage should not\r\nbe paid but only the out-of-pocket expenses, this being in conformity\r\nwith the principles adopted in paying for mail coaches. The question of\r\ntollage was not mentioned by the Railway Mails Act (10 and 11 Vict., c.\r\n85), but Major Harness, in his evidence before a parliamentary\r\ncommittee, stated that he, as an arbitrator, estimated the tollage\r\npayable by the Post Office by finding out how much each ton, if the road\r\nwere fully occupied, should contribute to return 10 per cent upon the\r\nshare capital and 5 per cent on the bonds, the Post Office to pay its\r\nproportion according to the weight of mail matter carried. The cost of\r\nlocomotive power was also taken into count and the carriage\r\naccommodation was paid for on the basis of what the railways charged\r\neach other.[304] In addition to these items the committee recommended\r\nthat the expenses for station accommodation, the additional cost of the\r\nworking staff, and interference with ordinary traffic should also be\r\ntaken into account.[305] In the event of a failure on the part of the\r\nPost Office and a railway company to come to an agreement as to the\r\namount payable, each of the parties nominated an arbitrator whose first\r\nduty was to select an umpire. Each arbitrator was required to present\r\nhis case in writing to the umpire and to attend in person if required.\r\nThe umpire was supposed to give his decision within twenty-eight days\r\nafter the receipt of the cases.[306] In 1893 it was provided by act of\r\nParliament that when any dispute arose between the Post Office and a\r\nrailway, the question should be taken to the Railway and Canal\r\nCommission for settlement instead of being left to arbitration.[307] The\r\nPostmaster-General has also been authorized to make use of tramways for\r\ntransporting the mails, and in 1897 the experiment was made of using\r\nmotor vans for the same purpose. A few years later the\r\nPostmaster-General expressed himself as \"doubtful whether a thoroughly\r\nreliable motor vehicle suitable for Post Office work has yet been\r\nfound.\" However, in 1906-07 about thirty-five mail services were\r\nperformed by motors, the work being undertaken by contractors who\r\nprovide the vans and employ the drivers. They have proved to be more\r\neconomical than horse vans when the load is heavy, the distance\r\nconsiderable, and greater speed desirable.[308]\r\n\r\n[304] _Rep.

In 1840 this had\r\nincreased to £52,860, in 1850 to £230,079, in 1860 to £490,223, in 1870\r\nto £587,296, in 1880 to £701,070 and in 1890 to £905,968. By 1896 the\r\nmillion mark had been reached and after that year all the expenses for\r\nthe conveyance of the mails are grouped together. For the following year\r\nthis total was £1,453,517, the payment for mail coaches in the preceding\r\nyear, which are here included, being £365,000. In 1906 the total\r\nexpenditure for the \"conveyance of the mails\" was £1,821,541.[309]\r\n\r\n[309] _Parl. Papers_, 1852-53, xcv, p. 3; _Rep. P. G._, 1861, p. 20;\r\n1872, pp. 26-27; 1884, p. 56; 1893, p. 78; 1896, p. 86; 1906, p. 92.\r\n\r\nIn common with the members of other branches of the civil service the\r\npostal employees, prior to 1855, were political appointees. The\r\nappointment of a patronage secretary had relieved members of Parliament\r\nfrom the odium incurred as a result of this reprehensible method of\r\nmanning the service, but it is doubtful whether any improvement in the\r\npersonnel of the force actually resulted or was even anticipated. With\r\nthe adoption between 1855 and 1870 of the principle that fitness should\r\nbe tested by competitive examinations, the vast majority of the members\r\nof the postal establishment came under its influence. At the same time\r\nthe postmasters of small rural communities, where the postal revenue was\r\ninsignificant,[310] still continued to be nominated by the local member.\r\nIn 1896 this power was abridged, but members still continued to exercise\r\na limited right of recommendation. Finally in 1907 the\r\nPostmaster-General announced that, though due weight should continue to\r\nbe given to the opinions of members in the case of the appointment of\r\nthese rural postmasters, such recommendations should be based on\r\npersonal knowledge and should carry no more weight than the opinion of\r\nany other competent person.[311]\r\n\r\n[310] Less than £120 in England, less than £100 in Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\n[311] D. B. Eaton, _Civil Service in Great Britain_, New York, 1880, pp.\r\n75, 307, 308; _Parl.

The first complaints which attract our\r\nattention during the period under discussion came rather from outside\r\nthe service as a protest against Sunday labour in the Post Office, but\r\nthe fact that many of the postal servants were deprived of their holiday\r\nand often needlessly so deprived was a real grievance advanced by the\r\nemployees themselves. It had been the policy of the Post Office for some\r\ntime not to grant any application for the withdrawal of a Sunday post if\r\nthere were any dissentients to the application. In 1850 all Sunday\r\ndelivery was abolished for a time, but this hardly met the approval even\r\nof the strict Sabbatarians, and the rule was promulgated the same year\r\nthat no post should be withdrawn or curtailed except upon the\r\napplication of the receivers of six sevenths of the letters so affected.\r\nOf the rural posts in the United Kingdom at that time more than half did\r\nno work on Sunday and about half of the remainder had their walks\r\ncurtailed, while in certain cases a substitute was provided on alternate\r\nSundays. A committee reporting on the question in 1871 advised that it\r\nshould be made easier to discontinue a Sunday delivery by requiring that\r\na Sunday rural post should be taken off if the receivers of two thirds\r\nof the letters desired it, that no delivery in the country should be\r\ngranted except upon the demand of the receivers of the same proportion\r\nof letters, and that the principle of providing substitutes on alternate\r\nSundays should be more generally adopted. This report was favourably\r\nreceived and its recommendations adopted in the early seventies. In\r\nLondon and many of the provincial towns there is no ordinary Sunday\r\ndelivery, and so little advantage is taken of the opportunity for\r\nexpress delivery on Sundays that there is presumably no strong demand\r\nfor a regular Sunday delivery. Various measures advocated for the relief\r\nof the town carriers were also adopted.[312]\r\n\r\n[312] _Acct. & P._, 1872, xxxvi, 337, pp. 1-2; _Rep. Commrs._, 1872,\r\nxviii [c. 485], pp. 1-5; _Rep. P. G._, 1872, p. 6; _Parl. Deb._, 4th\r\nser., xciv, coll. 1358-60, 1364-65.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 an attempt was made by the Post Office employees, led by the\r\nletter carriers, to secure higher wages and to obtain a remedy for\r\ncertain other grievances advanced by them. Sir George Bower asked for a\r\nselect committee of enquiry in their behalf but this was refused by the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. He agreed, however, to the appointment of a\r\ncommittee composed of Post Office and Treasury officials, but their\r\npersonnel was so repugnant to the employees that they refused to give\r\nevidence, and as a result of this and other difficulties four of their\r\nleaders were suspended. The protest on the part of the men was not\r\nentirely unproductive, for in the end the Postmaster-General granted\r\nthem a slight increase in their wages. At the same time he referred to\r\nthe following rates of wages in support of his contention that there was\r\nno good ground for dissatisfaction among the servants of the Post\r\nOffice: for carriers, 19_s._ a week advancing to 23_s._; for sorters of\r\nthe first class, 25_s._ to 30_s._; of the second class, 32_s._ to\r\n38_s._; and of the third class, 40_s._ to 50_s._ \"Carriers also obtain\r\nChristmas boxes averaging, so it is said, £8 a year. In addition these\r\nwages are exclusive of uniform, of pension in old age, and of assistance\r\nfor assurance.\"[313]\r\n\r\n[313] _Rep. P. G._, 1859, pp. 40-43; _Parl. Deb._, 3d ser., clix, coll.\r\n211-214; clxviii, coll. 675-82.\r\n\r\nThe first thorough-going attempts to remedy the grievances of the Post\r\nOffice employees were made in 1881 and 1882 by Mr. Fawcett in his\r\ncapacity as Postmaster-General. His scheme for improving the pay and\r\nposition of the sorters, sorting clerks, telegraphists, postmen, lobby\r\nofficers, and porters resulted in a mean annual cost to the Post Office\r\nof £320,000. In 1888, 1890, and 1891, under the supervision of Mr.\r\nRaikes, improvements were made in the condition of the chief clerks and\r\nother supervising officers, the sorting clerks and telegraphists in the\r\nprovinces, the telegraphists, counter-men and sorters in London, and the\r\nsorters in Dublin and Edinburgh at an additional yearly expense of\r\n£281,000. While the representatives of the London postmen were in\r\nprocess of examination, some of them went out on strike. They were\r\nseverely punished, some 450 men being dismissed in one morning, and a\r\ncommittee was appointed to enquire into the complaints of the London and\r\nprovincial postmen.[314] In the same month that the strike took place\r\nMr. Raikes announced increases in the pay of the postmen involving an\r\nadditional yearly payment of £125,000. The revisions so announced from\r\n1881 to 1894 have been estimated to involve an increased annual\r\nexpenditure of nearly £748,000.[315]\r\n\r\n[314] _Rep. P. G._, 1895, pp. 9-11; 1891, p. 3; _Parl. Deb._, 3d ser.,\r\ncccxviii, coll. 537, 1549; cccxlix, col. 213.\r\n\r\n[315] _Rep. P. G._, 1895, pp. 9-11.\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed in 1895 to deal with the discontent which was\r\nonly lessened, not silenced, by the efforts of Messrs. Fawcett and\r\nRaikes. This was composed of Lord Tweedmouth, Sir F. Mowatt, Mr. Spencer\r\nWalpole, and Mr. Llewellyn Smith, and the compromise which they proposed\r\nwas known as the \"Tweedmouth Settlement\" which apparently gave little\r\nsatisfaction at the time and less thereafter. It resulted in a higher\r\naverage rate of payment, but dissatisfaction was felt because the pay\r\nfor some services was less than before. The basis of the report was \"the\r\nabolition of classification whereby each man was allowed to proceed by\r\nannual increments to the maximum pay of a combined class, subject only\r\nto an efficiency-bar which he may not pass without a certificate of good\r\nconduct and ability, together with the abolition of allowances for\r\nspecial services.\" Differences in pay according to the volume of\r\nbusiness in particular localities were left untouched, and this was the\r\ncause of much complaint. Special inducements in the shape of double\r\nincrements were offered to the staff on the postal and telegraph sides\r\nto learn each other's work in order to lighten the strain which might\r\notherwise fall on a particular branch. Overtime, Sunday and bank-holiday\r\npay were assimilated throughout the service, and efforts were made to\r\nreduce the hardship resulting from \"split\" work, so called from the fact\r\nthat the working day of many of the men was divided by an interval when\r\nthere was nothing to do. The higher officials were acquitted of\r\nfavouritism in the matter of promotion and of \"unfairness and undue\r\nseverity in awarding punishments and in enforcing discipline.\" The\r\ngeneral charges of overcrowding the post offices and leaving them in an\r\nunsanitary condition were also rejected. The changes proposed were all\r\nadopted at an immediate estimated cost of £139,000 a year and an\r\nultimate cost, also estimated, of £275,000.[316] The Tweedmouth\r\nCommission in its turn was soon followed by a departmental committee,\r\ncomposed of the Duke of Norfolk, then Postmaster-General, and Mr.\r\nHanbury, the Secretary of the Treasury, then acting as the\r\nrepresentative of the Post Office in the House of Commons. The postal\r\nemployees demanded that their grievances should be laid before a select\r\ncommittee composed of members of the House of Commons, and motions to\r\nthat effect were introduced year after year only to meet the\r\nGovernment's disapproval. The most important demands of the men turned\r\nupon the questions of full civil rights, complete recognition of their\r\nunions, the employment of men who were not members of the civil service,\r\nand the old difficulty of wages and hours. So far as the question of\r\nfull civil rights was concerned, the Post Office employees had been\r\ngranted the franchise in 1874, but were required not to take an active\r\npart in aiding or opposing candidates for election, by serving on\r\ncommittees or otherwise making themselves unduly conspicuous in\r\nelections. The men demanded that these restrictions should be withdrawn.\r\nIn the second place, the Postmaster-General refused to receive\r\ndeputations from those employees not directly interested in the question\r\nat stake, refused to recognize officials who were not also employees of\r\nthe Department, and exercised more or less control over the meetings of\r\nemployees. Finally, in addition to the general demand for higher wages\r\ndue to the higher cost of living, the telegraphists contended that they\r\nhad been deceived by the promise of a maximum salary of £190 a year,\r\nwhereas they actually received only £160. Mr. A. Chamberlain opposed the\r\nappointment of a select committee of members of the House of Commons\r\nbecause of the pressure likely to be brought upon them and because of\r\ntheir unfitness to decide upon the question at issue. He agreed,\r\nhowever, after consultation with various members of Parliament and the\r\nmen themselves, that a committee of enquiry might reasonably be granted,\r\ncomposed of business men not in the Civil Service and not members of the\r\nHouse of Commons.[317]\r\n\r\n[316] _Rep. P. G._, 1897, pp. 27 f.\r\n\r\n[317] _Parl.

The members of this committee, interpreting their\r\ninstructions very loosely, extended their report to include their own\r\nrecommendations as to changes in pay, and refrained entirely from making\r\nany comparison between the wages of postal servants and those in other\r\nemployments, on the ground that such information was easily accessible\r\nfrom the statistics published by the Board of Trade. They added that it\r\nwas difficult to make any comparison between a national and a private\r\nservice, for payment according to results and dismissal at the will of\r\nthe employer are inapplicable under the state. There was also a pension\r\nfund in the service, the present value of which it is difficult to\r\nestimate. In their own words, \"It appears to us that the adequacy of the\r\nterms now obtaining may be tested by the numbers and character of those\r\nwho offer, by the capacity they show on trial, and finally by their\r\ncontentment.\" They agreed that there was no lack of suitable candidates\r\nand no complaints as to capacity, but there was widespread discontent.\r\nFinally the committee recommended the grading of the service as a whole,\r\ntaking into consideration the differences in cost of living as between\r\nLondon and other cities and between these cities and smaller towns and\r\nan increase in pay of the man at an age to marry, irrespective of years\r\nof service. \"They\" (the above recommendations) \"obviously do not concede\r\nall that has been asked for, but they go as far as we think justifiable\r\nin meeting the demands of the staff and we trust it will do much to\r\npromote that contentment which is so essential to hearty service.\"[318]\r\nFrom an examination of the evidence presented by the Committee and a\r\ncomparison of present scales of pay in the Post Office with those\r\ncurrent in other employments, the Postmaster-General concluded that\r\nthere was no reason for increasing the maximum wages payable, but there\r\nseemed to be ground for modifying and improving the scales in some\r\nrespects. The special increase at the age of twenty-five was granted.\r\nThe maximum was increased in London and the larger towns on account of\r\nthe higher cost of living and at the same time wages in the smaller\r\ntowns were advanced. The postmen also, both in London and the provinces,\r\nwere granted higher wages, and all payments to the members of the force\r\nwere in the future to be made weekly. The additional cost entailed by\r\nthese changes was estimated at £224,400 for 1905-06, the average in\r\nlater years at £372,300.[319]\r\n\r\n[318] _Rep. Commrs._, 1904, xxxiii, 171, pp. 5-26.\r\n\r\n[319] _Acc. & P._, 1905, xliv, 98, pp. 3-6; _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser.,\r\ncxlviii, col. 1363.\r\n\r\nThe Post Office employees who had asked for the appointment of a select\r\ncommittee were greatly dissatisfied with the personnel of the \"Bradford\r\nCommittee.\" This dissatisfaction on their part was increased by the fact\r\nthat the recommendations of the committee were to a great extent\r\ndisregarded by Lord Stanley on the ground that the members had not\r\nreported upon the question laid before them, but had instead proposed a\r\ncomplete reorganization of the whole of the service. He was willing to\r\ngrant some increase in pay but there were certain recommendations of the\r\ncommittee which he refused to accept. He himself was of the opinion that\r\nthe average wages of the employees were in excess of those of men doing\r\nsimilar work under competitive conditions, but the postmen objected to a\r\ncomparison of their wages with those of employees in the open labour\r\nmarket on the ground \"that there is no other employer who fixes his own\r\nprices or makes an annual profit of £4,000,000 sterling.\" Delegates\r\nrepresenting over 42,000 members of various postal associations\r\nprotested strongly against Lord Stanley's refusal to adopt the findings\r\nof the \"Bradford Committee\" _in toto_ and the men prepared to take an\r\nactive part against the Government in the approaching election. Appeals\r\nwere sent out by the men from which Lord Stanley quoted as follows in\r\nthe House: \"Two thirds at least of one political party are in great fear\r\nof losing their seats. The swing of the pendulum is against them and any\r\nmember who receives forty or fifty of such letters will under present\r\ncircumstances have to consider very seriously whether on this question\r\nhe can afford to go into the wrong lobby. This is taking advantage of\r\nthe political situation.\"[320] The Postmaster-General's unpopularity\r\nwith his employees was not diminished by his reference to these appeals\r\nas \"nothing more or less than blackmail.\" He himself was of the opinion\r\nthat there should be some organization outside of politics to which such\r\nquestions should be referred.[321]\r\n\r\n[320] In connection with such appeals both sides of the House as\r\nrepresented by their leaders had in 1892 advised that members should pay\r\nno attention to them (_Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., v, coll. 1123 f.).\r\n\r\n[321] _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., cxxxix, coll. 1633-34; cxlviii, coll.\r\n1350, 1357-61, 1365; the London _Times_, 1904, Oct. 11, p. 4; Oct. 18,\r\np. 4; Oct. 22, p. 10; 1905, Jan. 16, p. 7; Apr. 7, p. 11.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Liberals had come into power, a Post Office circular\r\nwas issued granting to the secretaries of the branches of the various\r\npostal organizations the right to make representations to the\r\nPostmaster-General relating to the service and affecting the class of\r\nwhich the branch of an association was representative. In matters solely\r\naffecting an individual the appeal had to come from the individual\r\nhimself. This was followed by a full recognition of the postal unions by\r\nthe new Postmaster-General, Mr. Buxton, with the rights of combination\r\nand representation through the representatives of different classes.\r\nThese conclusions were commented upon most favourably at the annual\r\nmeeting of the \"Postmen's Federation.\"[322] The representatives present\r\nwere glad to see that \"the old martinet system was fast breaking down.\"\r\n[323] But the greatest triumph of the men was to follow in the\r\nappointment of a select committee composed of members of the House of\r\nCommons with full powers to investigate the conditions of employment of\r\nthe postal employees and make such recommendations, based upon their\r\ninvestigation, as might seem suitable. Nine members were appointed for\r\nthis purpose, two of their number being members of the Labour Party, and\r\nMr. Hobhouse was chosen as chairman. Their report is very voluminous and\r\ntreats minutely all the questions concerning which the postal employees\r\nhad expressed so much dissatisfaction. The most important of these are\r\nconnected with the civil rights of the men, their wages, hours of\r\nlabour, and the conditions of their employment. The demand for full\r\ncivil rights was supported by four members on the ground that the\r\nposition of the postal employees is not in many respects \"comparable to\r\nthat of the Civil Service as a whole,\" but the point was lost for the\r\nmen by the vote of the chairman. Some departments asked for a reduction\r\nin the age of voluntary retirement from sixty to fifty and of compulsory\r\nretirement from sixty-five to sixty, but these changes were not\r\nrecommended by the committee. The question of extending part of their\r\npensions to the widows and children of deceased employees was referred\r\nto a plebiscite of the employees themselves. So far as incapacitated\r\nofficials were concerned, it was pointed out that the \"Workmen's\r\nCompensation Act\" of 1906 had been extended to them. Night work had been\r\nlimited to the time from 10 P.M. to 6 A.M., seven hours of night work\r\ncounting as eight hours of day work. The committee asked that night duty\r\nbe from 8 P.M. to 6 A.M., the ratio of the relative value to remain\r\nunchanged. Some servants asked for a forty-two hour week, especially in\r\nthe case of those who had \"split\" work to do, and for a half holiday\r\neach week. The committee thought that the forty-eight hour week should\r\nremain unchanged but that a half holiday might be granted where \"the\r\nexigencies of the service demand.\" They also recommended that\r\ncompensation should be allowed where free medical attendance was not\r\ngranted. There was a general protest from postmen, telegraphists, and\r\nsorters against the employment of casual and auxiliary labour on the\r\nground that it dealt a blow at thorough work and trade unionism. The\r\nDepartment replied that it was necessary in the case of especially busy\r\nholiday periods and where \"split\" attendance was unavoidable. The\r\ncommittee contented themselves by asking that casuals who have full work\r\nelsewhere should not be employed. The claim on the part of the employees\r\nthat promotion should be contingent on \"seniority, good conduct and\r\nability,\" in the order named was not accepted by the committee, whose\r\nmembers contended that ability, as at present, should count for most. So\r\nfar as wages themselves were concerned, a general increase was approved\r\nby the committee, and it also, commenting unfavourably on the complexity\r\nand number of existing classes, recommended a reduction in their number\r\nand greater regularity and simplicity in grading them. [324]\r\n\r\n[322] The Postmen's Federation was established in 1891 and a journal,\r\nthe _Postman's Gazette_, representing their views, was started in the\r\nfollowing year (_Postman's Gazette_, May 28, 1892; _Post Office\r\nCircular_, no. 1702).\r\n\r\n[323] _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., cliv, col. 202; clix, col. 396; clxxiv,\r\ncol. 387; the London _Times_, 1906, June 9, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[324] _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., cliii, coll. 323-38, 354-58; _Rep. Com._,\r\n1907, 266.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the \"Hobhouse Committee\" have proved, in many\r\nrespects, unsatisfactory to the postal employees who have not hesitated\r\nto express their condemnation of what they consider the sins both of\r\ncommission and omission of the members. In the words of the delegates\r\nfrom the branches of the \"Postmen's Federation\" meeting in London: \"We\r\nexpress our deep disappointment with the report of the Select Committee\r\nfor the following reasons\": the \"cowardice\" of the committee in\r\nrecommending the continuance of the system of Christmas boxes; the\r\nfailure in many cases to increase the minimum and maximum rates of\r\nwages; the mistaken method of grading towns for wages; the failure to\r\ngrant full civil rights and the granting of so much power to the\r\npermanent officials. The Conference of Postal Clerks in turn expressed\r\ntheir dissatisfaction with the findings of the committee. The \"Irish\r\nPostal and Telegraph Guardian\" considered that the \"report had\r\nintensified discontent\" and commented on the fact that large increases\r\nin salaries to highly paid classes had been recommended without any\r\nagitation on their part while the lower grades got practically nothing,\r\nthis in direct opposition to opinions expressed both by Mr. Buxton and\r\nMr. Ward, a member of the committee. Deputations were appointed to\r\ndiscuss with the Postmaster-General those findings of the committee\r\nwhich were unsatisfactory, but Mr. Buxton refused to grant a re-trial of\r\nthe controverted points although he agreed to listen to the plea of\r\nthose employees whose case had not been presented before the committee.\r\n[325]\r\n\r\n[325] _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., clxxxiv, coll. 1058-59, 1061-66, 1080;\r\ncxcii, coll. 1175, 1173; the London _Times_, 1907, Aug. 19, p. 17; Aug.\r\n20, p. 2; Oct. 16, p. 12.\r\n\r\nMr. Buxton explained his position with reference to the recommendations\r\nof the committee in a speech delivered in the House. He knew that in the\r\ncase of the Tweedmouth and Bradford committees the men stated beforehand\r\nthat they would not be bound by the decisions reached, but on the other\r\nhand had asked for a Parliamentary committee as the only solution of the\r\ndifficulty. Broadly speaking, he was of the opinion that the findings of\r\nthe committee should be binding, and he understood that the men would\r\nagree to accept them. There were, however, certain points of the report\r\non which nearly every section of the staff asked for a re-trial, but\r\nthis he was compelled to refuse. The most important recommendations of\r\nthe committee which were adopted by Mr. Buxton are: an increase in the\r\ncase of each employee to the minimum or \"age pay\" of his class; the\r\nextension of the \"technical increment\" beyond the ordinary maximum pay,\r\nafter a searching examination; the reduction in London of the four\r\n\"wage\" zones to three; a reduction in the number of classes in the\r\nprovinces, with wages based on volume of work and cost of living in the\r\norder named; a reduction after the first five years from five to four\r\nyears in the period necessary to obtain good conduct stripes; an\r\nincrease in the pay of women; a reduction in the amount of auxiliary\r\nlabour employed; night labour to be reckoned from 8 instead of 10 P.M.;\r\novertime to be watched and checked; unsanitary conditions in the Post\r\nOffice buildings to be remedied; and wages increased in the engineering\r\nbranch.[326]\r\n\r\n[326] _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., clxxxiv, coll. 1058-70; cxcii, coll.\r\n1120-21. It has been estimated that the recommendations adopted by the\r\nPostmaster-General will entail upon the country an additional cost of\r\nabout £600,000, rising to £1,000,000 (_Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., cxcii,\r\ncol. 1156).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE TRAVELLERS' POST AND POST HORSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duty of providing horses for conveying letters and for the use of\r\ntravellers on affairs of state was enforced from the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century by orders and warrants issued by the\r\nPostmaster-General and the Privy Council to mayors, sheriffs,\r\nconstables, and other officials.[327] Where ordinary posts were laid,\r\nthe postmen themselves were supposed to have horses ready. Such at least\r\nwas the understanding, not, however, invariably realized. In 1533 we\r\nfind the Postmaster-General complaining that, except between London and\r\nDover, there were never any horses provided over the whole kingdom.[328]\r\nA few years later when the London-Berwick posts became an established\r\nfact each postman had to provide one horse, always to be ready to carry\r\neither the mails or a chance traveller on affairs of state. In 1542,\r\nsince, owing to trouble with Scotland, the number of letters and\r\ntravellers between that country and London had become much more\r\nnumerous, each postman was required to have in readiness three horses\r\ninstead of one, and it was partly for this reason that their pay was\r\nincreased at the same time.[329] The fee for the use of these horses was\r\nfixed at a penny a horse for every mile travelled. Generally this fee\r\nwas named in the warrant empowering the traveller to take up\r\nhorses.[330] When the sum was not definitely named, it was required that\r\nit should be reasonable.[331] It seems to have been the custom of the\r\nmembers of the Council to grant these warrants quite indiscriminately.\r\nTo remedy this, it was provided in 1566 that in future no warrant should\r\nbe granted to any person, who was not actually travelling upon state\r\naffairs.[332] Twelve years later we find the people of Grantham\r\npetitioning the Council against the taking-up of horses to ride post.\r\nThey said that the practice had increased so much that it had become\r\nintolerable.[333] The demand for horses had become so great that 2_d._ a\r\nmile was asked for each horse and complaint was made that travellers and\r\nmessengers refused to pay the increased charge.[334] It is improbable\r\nthat the state was successful in preventing the use of the postmasters'\r\nhorses by private individuals, and it is more improbable still that the\r\npostmasters themselves objected to hiring their horses to those who\r\ntravelled on their own affairs. Warrants issued by the Council nearly\r\nalways fixed the price which should be paid. Now such prices, like wages\r\nwhen fixed by employers, are likely to be lower than demand and supply\r\nwarrant. On the other hand, as between the postmasters and the ordinary\r\ntravellers, the question of charge was adjusted by agreement.\r\n\r\n[327] Hist. MSS. Com. _Rep._, 14, app., pt. 8, p. 35; _P. & O.

D._, 1547-80, p. 612.\r\n\r\n[334] _Ibid._, 1547-80, p. 362.\r\n\r\nWhen the postmasters themselves were too poor to obtain horses at their\r\nown expense, they were sometimes aided by the town or county. In\r\nNorfolk, for instance, each one of three postmasters was provided with a\r\ncertain sum out of the treasury of the city of Norwich to be lent\r\nwithout interest. They were also paid so much a year out of money levied\r\non the people of Norwich, one half on the innkeepers and tipplers and\r\none half on the other inhabitants. No man was to take up post horses in\r\nNorwich unless licensed by warrants from the Queen, the Council, the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, or the Mayor of Norwich. No one was to ride a horse\r\nfarther than twelve or fourteen miles at a stretch, and he was to pay\r\n2_d._ each mile and 6_d._ to his guide to lead back the horses. No horse\r\nwas to carry any cloak bag over ten pounds in weight.[335]\r\n\r\n[335] F. Blomefield, _Norfolk_, 1806, iii, p. 294.\r\n\r\nIf more horses were demanded from the postmaster than he himself had in\r\nhis stable, he might seize them from his neighbours but the full amount\r\npaid was to go to the owners. The date of the commission empowering\r\nhorses to be used, the name of the person using them, and the date when\r\nthe horses were demanded were to be entered in a book, kept for the\r\npurpose.[336]\r\n\r\n[336] _A. P. C._, 1571-75, p. 181.\r\n\r\nComplaints from the postmasters concerning the abuses of travellers\r\nwere frequent. The London-Berwick posts in a petition to the Council\r\nstated that on account of the great number riding over that road many of\r\ntheir horses were injured or spoiled and were not paid for, while the\r\nconstables, whose duty it was to see that horses were provided, were\r\noften ill-treated. Accordingly by a proclamation issued in 1578, it was\r\nprovided that no commission to ride in post should be issued unless it\r\nwas first moved at a council meeting or ordered by the Secretary for\r\ncauses properly relating to Her Majesty's service.[337] This was\r\nfollowed in 1582 by a still more stringent proclamation, forbidding any\r\nperson to use a commission more than once unless otherwise specified.\r\nThe pay of 2_d._ a mile for each horse was to be in advance as was also\r\nthe \"guide's groat\" and, if the payment was not so advanced, the\r\npostmaster might refuse to supply horses.[338] Occasionally we find\r\npeople objecting to having their horses taken when the postmaster had\r\nnot sufficient of his own. Complaints like these were generally followed\r\nby an order to the offending postmaster to provide himself with more\r\nhorses.[339]\r\n\r\n[337] _A. P. C._, 1577-78, p. 219. A particularly violent man roused the\r\nire of the Mayor of Guildford, who wrote to Walsingham asking for\r\ndamages to a gelding killed by a Mr. Wynckfeld, riding post from\r\nGuildford to Kingston. The gelding stumbled and fell on the road and\r\nWynckfeld thrust his dagger into him, beat the guide and threatened to\r\nkill the constables on his return (_Cal. S. P. D._, ii, p. 529).\r\n\r\n[338] _A. P. C._, 1577-78, p. 219.\r\n\r\n[339] _Ibid._, 1588-89, p. 206.\r\n\r\nThe travellers, however, were not the only people who were at fault. The\r\nowners of the horses were often offenders and can hardly be blamed for\r\nrendering as difficult as possible the enforcement of the obnoxious\r\nproclamations, which they were ordered to obey. If they had to supply\r\nhorses, they must do so, but there was nothing to prevent them from\r\noffering clumsy plough horses or venerable specimens no longer capable\r\nof drawing a plough. The constables were more apt to sympathize with the\r\nowners, who were their neighbours, than with the travellers.\r\nConsequently it is not surprising that complaints were loud and deep\r\nover the pieces of horseflesh, whose angular outlines must have\r\npresented a sorry seat for the Queen's messengers.[340]\r\n\r\n[340] _Ibid._, 1577-78, p. 62; 1580-81, p. 203.\r\n\r\nBy a Privy Council proclamation issued in 1603, all posts receiving a\r\ndaily fee were required to keep at least two horses apiece. So far as\r\nthe letting of horses was concerned, they had up to this time been\r\nsubject to competition from other people, who had horses to hire. They\r\nwere now granted the prior right to provide horses for travellers and it\r\nwas only in case of their supply being inadequate that horses might be\r\nprocured elsewhere. The hire as usual was to be paid in advance and was\r\nfixed at 2-1/2_d._ a mile, together with the guide's fee for those\r\nriding on commission and was to be settled by agreement for all others.\r\nNo heavier burden than thirty pounds in excess of the rider's weight was\r\nto be carried by each horse.[341]\r\n\r\n[341] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., pp. 38, 39, 40 (18).\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with the monopolistic restriction of 1603 that\r\nMacaulay says that the state must have reaped a large reward from the\r\nprior right of the postmasters to hire horses to travellers.[342] Mr.\r\nJoyce has pointed out that the proceeds went to the postmasters and not\r\nto the state, but he has given no good reason for dissenting from\r\nMacaulay's opinion. Without doubt Joyce is correct, as is shown by a\r\ncomplaint from the postmasters on the Western Road that they had been\r\ninjured by an interloper who supplied travellers with horses.[343] In\r\n1779, the state made an attempt to obtain something from the postmasters\r\nby requiring them to take out a licence for the hiring of horses and to\r\npay a percentage for their receipts to the government.[344] Indirectly,\r\nhowever, the state did reap some benefit from the revenue from post\r\nhorses, for if the postmasters had received nothing from their horses or\r\nfrom the conveyance of private letters, it would have been necessary to\r\npay their salaries much more promptly than was the custom. As early as\r\nthe latter part of the sixteenth century, we find complaints from the\r\nLondon-Dover posts that they had received nothing on their salaries for\r\na whole year.[345] This was nothing to later complaints and proves that\r\nan impecunious government was enabled to act the bad debtor by the fact\r\nthat other forms of revenue were available for the postmasters.\r\n\r\n[342] Macaulay, _Hist. of England_, 1849, i, p. 387.\r\n\r\n[343] _Cal.

The postmasters complained\r\nthat they were held responsible for supplying horses, and yet, when it\r\nwas necessary to obtain them from the surrounding country, they were\r\nresisted by the owners or were supplied with inefficient animals.[347]\r\nThe complaints of the public were more to the purpose. According to them\r\nthere were some who were being called upon constantly for horses while\r\nothers escaped all demands. The postmasters often accepted bribes from\r\nowners of horses on condition that they should not be troubled.[348] At\r\ntimes the horses, after being seized, were not used but were kept in the\r\nstables of the postmasters, and their owners charged the expense of\r\nmaintaining them.\r\n\r\n[346] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 42 (20).\r\n\r\n[347] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1619-23, p. 517.\r\n\r\n[348] _Ibid._, 1619-23, p. 86; 1635, p. 18; 1631-33, p. 257.\r\n\r\nAt the establishment of Witherings' plan in 1635, the postmasters on all\r\nthe roads in England were required to have as many horses ready as were\r\nnecessary for the carriage of letters and the accommodation of\r\ntravellers. The rate for each horse was lowered from 3_d._ to 2-1/2_d._\r\nor 5_d._ for two horses and a guide.[349] Before 1635, the post enjoyed\r\nno priority over the traveller in being provided with horses, and if all\r\nthe horses happened to be in use when the mail arrived, it had to wait.\r\nNow it was provided that on the day when the mail was expected, enough\r\nhorses should be kept in the stable to ensure its prompt\r\ntransmission.[350] In 1637, after Witherings' dismissal, the fee for the\r\nhire of a horse was raised again to 3_d._ at which rate it continued\r\nuntil 1657, when it was lowered to 2-1/2_d._ by the Commonwealth\r\nGovernment. So much trouble had been caused by the seizure of horses\r\nfrom owners unwilling to part with them that it was provided by the act\r\nof 1657 that no one might take or seize horses for service without the\r\nconsent of the owner, but no one save the Postmaster-General and his\r\ndeputies might hire horses to persons riding in post with or without\r\ncommission.[351] At the Restoration in 1660, the old rate of 3_d._ a\r\nmile for each horse was re-imposed together with a 4_d._ fee to the\r\nguide for each stage. If the postmaster was unable to furnish horses\r\nwithin half an hour, they might be obtained elsewhere, but always with\r\nthe consent of the owner.[352]\r\n\r\n[349] _Ibid._, 1635, p. 299.\r\n\r\n[350] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 57 (36); _Cal. S. P. D._, 1637,\r\np. 338.\r\n\r\n[351] Scobell, _Collect._, 1656, c. 30.\r\n\r\n[352] 12 Ch. II, c. 35.\r\n\r\nThe sole right to supply horses was continued to the Postmasters-General\r\nand their deputies by the famous act of 1711. The rate per horse and the\r\nguide's fee remained at the figure imposed by the act of 1660. If the\r\npostmaster did not supply the horses demanded within half an hour, he\r\nwas liable to a fine of £5 and the horses might be obtained from any one\r\nwho would consent to hire them. The maximum burden for one horse over\r\nand above the rider's weight was eighty pounds.[353]\r\n\r\n[353] 9 Anne, c. 11.\r\n\r\nThe postmasters enjoyed the monopoly of letting horses to travellers\r\nuntil the middle of the eighteenth century. But the industrial growth of\r\nEngland and the improvement in the roads had produced such an increase\r\nin the number of travellers that the postmasters were unable to supply\r\nthe demand. The use of carriages had become more common, enabling people\r\nto travel who could not proceed on horseback, and this had still further\r\nincreased the demand for horses. It was plain that something must be\r\ndone and some more extensive source of supply drawn upon than that\r\nfurnished under the old system. The postmen had heard some of the\r\nrumours in the air that a change was about to be made, and they\r\nforwarded a petition to the House of Commons, protesting against the\r\ncontemplated change as an infringement upon their old monopoly. They\r\nsaid \"that if the amendment should pass into a law as it is now drawn,\r\nit would not only tend to the great damage and loss of the petitioners,\r\nbut also the prejudice of His Majesty's revenue.\"[354] The amendment did\r\npass, however, declaring that in future any one might furnish chaises\r\nand calashes with horses and that people letting chaises might supply\r\nhorses for them at the same time.[355]\r\n\r\n[354] _Jo. H. C._, 1745-50, p. 830.\r\n\r\n[355] 22 Geo. II, c. 25.\r\n\r\nIn 1779, when the Treasury was sadly in need of money, an act was\r\npassed, requiring all persons letting horses to take out licences. In\r\naddition, duties were levied on all horses and carriages hired for the\r\npurpose of travelling post.[356] In the following year this act was\r\nsuperseded by a stricter and more comprehensive one. It was provided by\r\nthe new act that every person letting horses to travel should pay five\r\nshillings a year for a licence. In addition one penny a mile should be\r\npaid for every horse, or, if the distance was not known, 1_s._ 6_d._ a\r\nday, such duties to be paid by the person hiring the horses to the\r\npostmaster or other person who provided them, to be by him handed over\r\nto the Treasury. At the time of payment the postmaster was to give the\r\ntraveller a ticket, which must be shown to the toll keepers on the road.\r\nIf he had no ticket to show, the toll keeper was ordered not to allow\r\nhim to pass.[357] Five years later the duty to be collected was raised\r\nto 1-1/2_d._ a mile for each horse or 1_s._ 9_d._ a day.[358] In 1787,\r\npermission was given to let these duties out to farm, because so many\r\ndifficulties had been experienced in their collection.[359] The whole\r\ntheory of these duties was illogical, for it was to every one's interest\r\nto evade them, and direct supervision was impossible. In 1808 another\r\nact for farming the post-horse duties was passed, modifying somewhat the\r\nprovisions of the previous act. The tax was to extend to horses used in\r\ntravelling, when hired by the mile or stage and when hired for a period\r\nof time less than twenty-eight days for drawing carriages used in\r\ntravelling post. Persons licenced to let horses were required to have\r\ntheir names and places of abode painted on their post carriages if they\r\nprovided these also. The carriages must have numbers painted on them so\r\nas to distinguish them easily.[360] In 1823 all previous acts relating\r\nto licences and fees for keeping horses for hire were repealed, and a\r\ncomplete system of rates was substituted. Every postmaster or other\r\nperson keeping horses to hire for riding by post must pay an annual\r\nlicence of five shillings and additional duties calculated according to\r\ndistance or time. The Treasury was given authority to let these duties\r\nto farm.[361]\r\n\r\n[356] 19 Geo. III, c. 51.\r\n\r\n[357] 20 Geo. III, c. 51.\r\n\r\n[358] 25 Geo. III, c. 51.\r\n\r\n[359] 27 Geo.

Regular\r\nposts were established between London and Portsmouth when the fleet was\r\nthere and discontinued as soon as it left, so that it can hardly be\r\nincluded among the regular roads.[364] Between 1580 and the accession of\r\nJames I, there was a distinct revival in postal affairs within and\r\nwithout the kingdom. The posts on the London-Holyhead road had been\r\ndischarged for some time and Irish letters were conveyed to London by\r\nthe postmaster at Chester.[365] In 1581 Gascoyne, the acting\r\nPostmaster-General, was ordered to appoint stages and postmen on this\r\nold route.[366] A letter patent was issued, calling upon all Her\r\nMajesty's officers to assist him in so doing, and a warrant was signed\r\nfor the payment of £20 to defray his expenses. The Rye-Dieppe posts were\r\nalso reorganized, principally for the conveyance of letters to and from\r\nFrance.[367] Bristol ranked next to London in size and importance, but\r\nit was not until 1580 that orders were given to horse and man the road\r\nbetween the two cities,[368] and only in the following decade were posts\r\nalso laid from London to Exeter and somewhat later from Exeter to\r\nPlymouth.[369] This illustrates as well as anything the fact that the\r\nearly English postal system was mainly political in its aims. The great\r\npost roads were important from a political rather than an economic\r\nstandpoint. It was necessary to keep in close touch with Scotland\r\nbecause the Scotch would always stand watching. The wild Irish needed a\r\nstrong hand and it was expedient that English statesmen should be well\r\nacquainted with things Irish. The post to and from the continent was\r\nquite as necessary to keep them informed of French and Spanish politics.\r\n\r\n[362] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 32 (7).\r\n\r\n[363] _L.& P. Hen.

By this method\r\na fair rate of speed should have been maintained, for the horses' path\r\nin the middle of the road was as a rule not so bad as seriously to\r\nimpede travelling.[370] Nevertheless complaints about the tardiness of\r\nthe post are numerous. Lisle, the Warden of the Marches, said that\r\nletters from London were nearly five days in reaching him at\r\nAlnwick.[371] Nine days from London to Carlisle was considered too slow\r\nbut it often took that long, notwithstanding that the letters were\r\nmarked twice \"for life, for life.\"[372] The Earl of Sussex complained to\r\nCecil that they never arrived in York under three days. He expected too\r\nmuch, however, for three days from London to York was considered good\r\nspeed.[373] According to a post label made out in 1589, the distance\r\nfrom Berwick to Huntingdon was accomplished in ninety-one hours. By the\r\nmileage tables then published, the distance was 203 miles, giving an\r\naverage speed of only a little over two miles an hour. It is only fair\r\nto add that the real distance was 282 miles, and this would raise the\r\nspeed to about three miles an hour.[374] The distance from Dover to\r\nLondon was covered in twelve hours, from Plymouth to Hartford Bridge in\r\nforty-four hours, from Portsmouth to Farnham in five hours, from\r\nWeymouth to Staines via Sherborne in five days, but this must have been\r\nexceptionally long.[375]\r\n\r\n[370] Hist.

Complaints continued\r\nto come in pretty constantly during the first thirty-five years of the\r\nseventeenth century.[377] Secretary Conway wrote to Secretary Coke that\r\nthe posts must be punished for their tardiness.[378] Even those from\r\nLondon to Dover were reprimanded and they had hitherto given the best\r\nsatisfaction. The postmaster at Dover was threatened with imprisonment\r\nunless he mended his ways.[379] Letters were either not delivered at all\r\nor were needlessly delayed on the road. Some of the postmasters, who\r\nheld lucrative positions, were themselves absentees and their work was\r\nperformed by their agents, who were often incompetent, and this sort of\r\nthing was connived at by the Postmaster-General, from whom their\r\npositions were bought. The postmen themselves acknowledged their\r\ntardiness but said that they were able to do no better, since they had\r\nreceived no wages for several years.[380] One had been paid nothing for\r\nover two years,[6] another had received no wages for seven years,[381]\r\nand finally in 1628 a petition was presented to the Privy Council from\r\n\"all the posts in England, being in number ninety-nine poor men.\" This\r\npetition prays for their arrears, due since 1621, the amount unpaid\r\nbeing £22,626, \"notwithstanding the great charge they are at in the\r\nkeeping of many servants and horses to do His Majesty's service.\"[382]\r\nThe Council did not grant their petition, for two years later £25,000\r\nwere still due them.[383]\r\n\r\n[376] _Rep.

These\r\norders formed part of the directions given to the farmer of the posts in\r\nthe following year.[385] Cromwell seems to have recognized the\r\nimpracticability of enforcing the speed limit ordered by Elizabeth in\r\nthe case of the ordinary mails. He issued orders that in future only\r\npublic despatches or letters from and to certain high officials should\r\nbe sent by express, and such despatches and letters must be carried at a\r\nspeed of seven miles an hour from the first of April to the thirtieth of\r\nSeptember, and five miles an hour the rest of the year.[386]\r\n\r\n[384] _Ibid._, 1652-53, p. 312.\r\n\r\n[385] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1652-53, p. 449.\r\n\r\n[386] _Ibid._, 1655, pp. 285-86.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the seventeenth century, more attention was directed\r\nto the slowness of the posts and the delays along the road. The average\r\nspeed on the great roads varied from three to four miles an hour,\r\nanything below three miles generally calling for reproof. For instance,\r\nthe posts on the Portsmouth road were reprimanded for travelling only\r\ntwenty-two miles in ten hours.[387] It was said that it took the\r\nYarmouth mail sixty-six hours to travel less than one hundred miles. The\r\npost labels were an important check upon the postmaster's carelessness.\r\nEach postmaster was supposed to mark the time that he received the mail\r\non a label attached to it for that purpose. In this way no postmaster\r\nmarked the speed that his own postboy made and each was a check upon his\r\nneighbour.[388] Lord Arlington gave orders in 1666 for this practice to\r\nbe enforced more strictly. In addition to marking the time of arrival,\r\nthe time of departure was also to be added.[389] A year later a further\r\nimprovement was made by the use of printed labels, containing also\r\ndirections as to speed. The names of the post towns through which the\r\nmail must pass were also added, and blanks were left for the postmasters\r\nto fill in the hours of arrival and departure.[390]\r\n\r\n[387] _Ibid._, 1661-62, p. 385.\r\n\r\n[388] _Ibid._, 1665-66, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[389] _Ibid._, 1666-67, p. 384.\r\n\r\n[390] _Ibid._, 1667-68, p. 116. From copies of these labels made out in\r\n1666 and 1667 we know exactly how long it took to convey the mails\r\nbetween London and the important cities of the kingdom although the time\r\nvaried more or less at different trips and different seasons.\r\n\r\n      _Between_                    _Hours_\r\n   London and Yarmouth         From 29 to 32\r\n              Plymouth              50    58\r\n              York                  39    42\r\n              Chester               30    56\r\n              Bristol               25    30\r\n              Gloucester            20    26\r\n              Portsmouth            15    23\r\n              Edinburgh             73   103*\r\n              Newcastle             57    81\r\n              Manchester            32    48\r\n              Preston               47    58\r\n              Dover                 19    22\r\n              Southampton           18    23\r\n  (_Cal.

The Post Office had for its own use a\r\ntable of places along the great roads,[391] and from the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, private individuals began to publish road maps. On\r\nthese maps, the post towns are marked by a castle with a flag flying\r\nfrom it. Some of them are quite artistically done and represent on a\r\nlarge scale every important road in England with the places where branch\r\nroads leave them. One map has each road outlined on a long scroll, and\r\nit gives the rivers, brooks, bridges, elevations, villages, post towns,\r\nforests, and branch roads throughout the whole distance.[392] In 1668,\r\nHicks, in writing to Arlington's secretary, advised him not to have a\r\nnew map of the post roads printed, fearing the great changes that might\r\nthereby be produced in the Post Office. He says: \"When Parliament sees\r\nhow all the branches lie and most of them carried on at the charge of\r\nthose in the country concerned, they will try to have them carried\r\nthrough by the Postmaster-General, which will be very chargeable.\"[393]\r\n\r\n[391] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1673-75, p. 494.\r\n\r\n[392] John Ogilby, _Itinerarium Angliae_, 1675.\r\n\r\n[393] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1667-68, p. 543.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the seventeenth century, the five great roads to\r\nEdinburgh, Holyhead, Bristol, Plymouth, and Dover remained practically\r\nunchanged. The Plymouth road had been continued to Falmouth and the\r\nNorthern Road now passed through York. The greatest changes noticeable\r\nare in the Southern and Eastern counties. In the South, nearly all the\r\ncoast towns were now connected with the Falmouth road, and the post ran\r\nto the extreme southwest of Cornwall. Portsmouth had a direct service\r\nfrom London through Arundel and Chichester. There were branches from the\r\nFalmouth road to several towns in Dorset and Somerset, but as a rule the\r\ncountry between the two great roads to the West was poorly supplied. A\r\nnew road of considerable importance ran from Maidenhead on the Bristol\r\nroad through Abingdon, Gloucester, Cardiff, and Swansea to Milford,\r\nwhere there was a packet boat for Ireland. From this road there were a\r\nfew unimportant branches to the North.\r\n\r\nIn the Northeast, the post road to Edinburgh now passed through York to\r\nNorthallerton. From York there was a branch to Scarborough and Whitby. A\r\nnew road left the Edinburgh road at Royston, about forty miles from\r\nLondon, and passed along the coast nearly parallel to the great road,\r\nthrough Newmarket, Lynn, Boston, and Hull to Bridlington. Another branch\r\nleft Newmarket for Norwich and the seacoast towns of northern Norfolk.\r\nAn important road left London for Yarmouth, with branches to the coast\r\ntowns of Suffolk. One new road ran through the midland counties, leaving\r\nthe Holyhead road about thirty miles from London and passing through\r\nSheffield, Manchester, and Preston to Carlisle. Derby was supplied by an\r\neast and west road from Grimsby to Manchester. Liverpool had a post road\r\nto Manchester. In 1683, provision was made for an extension of the post\r\nroads by an order issued to the Postmaster-General to set up posts\r\nbetween the market towns and the nearest post towns. These were called\r\nbye-posts. It was to them that Hicks had objected as leading to\r\nincreased expense. At the same time orders were given for a map to be\r\nprinted, showing where all these bye-posts were situated so that people\r\nmight know where to address their letters.[394]\r\n\r\n[394] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 91 (64).\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, there were three main post roads, running from Dublin\r\nthrough Ulster, Munster, and Connaught.[395] There were practically no\r\npost roads worthy of the name in Scotland. That part of the great North\r\nRoad beyond the Tweed was English rather than Scotch. Between Edinburgh\r\nand Glasgow there was a foot-post. The mail was also carried between\r\nGlasgow and Portpatrick.[396] In 1699, the length of the roads in\r\nAmerica over which the mails passed was 700 miles. These roads connected\r\nthe principal towns along the Atlantic coast.[397]\r\n\r\n[395] Joyce, p. 53.\r\n\r\n[396] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1739-41, p. 240; _Rep.

P._, 1697-1702, p. 280.\r\n\r\nIn 1696, the Postmaster-General reported favourably on the establishment\r\nof a cross post road between Bristol and Exeter.[398] The report was\r\napproved, and two years later Bristol and Exeter had direct postal\r\ncommunication. Colonial and foreign letters for Bristol, after their\r\narrival in Falmouth, still went via London.[399] Towns adjacent to\r\nBristol and Exeter, which might have been connected with the cross post,\r\nremained separated. For example, the post went from London through\r\nCirencester to Wotton-under-Edge, which was within fourteen miles of\r\nBristol, yet letters from Cirencester to Exeter went via London.[400]\r\nThe Exeter-Bristol cross post proved a success. After it had been in\r\noperation three years, it produced over £350 net profits a year. The use\r\nof cross posts was advocated as leading to the conveyance of a larger\r\nnumber of letters, and private individuals started to establish\r\nthem.[401] In 1700, the post road from Exeter to Bristol was continued\r\nto Chester through Worcester and Shrewsbury.[402] Three years later, a\r\ndirect road was ordered between Exeter and Truro, but it seems to have\r\nbeen discontinued after one year's trial.[403]\r\n\r\n[398] _Ibid._, 1657-96, p. 55.\r\n\r\n[399] Latimer, _Annals of Bristol_, p. 488.\r\n\r\n[400] _Cal.

A\r\nmile on the London-Edinburgh road was fully ten furlongs. This had\r\nresulted in a decreased revenue from post horses and often unjustifiable\r\nreprimands for slowness. By a provision in the act of 1711, it was\r\nordered that all the post roads in the kingdom should be measured. This\r\nwas to be done by officials appointed by the Postmaster-General and the\r\nmeasurements left in the general offices in London, Edinburgh, and\r\nDublin.[404]\r\n\r\n[404] 9 Anne, c. 11.\r\n\r\nAs the seventeenth century had seen the extension of roads in the\r\nsouthern and eastern counties of England, so the eighteenth century was\r\nmarked by the establishment of posts in those parts of the kingdom most\r\naffected by the industrial revolution. The country about Birmingham,\r\nKidderminster, and Worcester was to share in the better postal\r\nfacilities offered by the mail coaches. Lancashire and the West Riding\r\nof York were not debarred from the use of Palmer's innovation. This was\r\nespecially the case in Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Halifax, and\r\nLeeds, for where industrial expansion paved the way, the coaches were\r\nsure to follow.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century the roads in Ireland were\r\nattracting considerable attention, and it was the slow speed made by the\r\nmail carts there which was a primary cause in producing any improvement.\r\nThe Postmasters-General were directed to cause surveys to be made and\r\nmaps drawn of those roads in Ireland over which the mail passed. The\r\nroads were to be levelled so that the ascent or descent should be no\r\nmore than one foot in thirty-five wherever this was practicable, the\r\nexpense to be borne by the county or barony.[405] This was in 1805, and\r\nthe next year the Grand Jury was given the power to call for another\r\nsurvey, and the surveyor whom they appointed was to decide as to the\r\nnecessity for a change in the direction of the road. Copies of all Grand\r\nJury presentments were to be made to the Postmasters-General.[406] In\r\n1813 the Grand Juries were empowered to present for damages accruing to\r\nowners and occupiers of land, such damages to be raised by the county\r\nand advanced from the consolidated fund.[407]\r\n\r\n[405] 45 Geo.

III, c. 146.\r\n\r\nAfter 1817, the Postmasters-General were able to report a considerable\r\nacceleration in the speed at which the mails were carried. This was\r\nowing largely to the introduction of a lighter and more improved type of\r\nmail coach, and after 1821 the use of steam packet boats in the case of\r\nthe transportation of the Irish and continental mails. Letters leaving\r\nLondon at 8 P.M. on Tuesday for Ireland had not been delivered in Dublin\r\nuntil 10 A.M. on Friday. In 1817 they arrived on Thursday in time for\r\ndelivery on that day.[408] In 1828, the coaches travelled from London to\r\nHolyhead, a distance of 261 miles, in twenty-nine hours and seventeen\r\nminutes. Four years later the time had been reduced to twenty-eight\r\nhours.[409] By the introduction of one of the patent mail coaches on the\r\nYarmouth road, the inhabitants of that town were enabled to answer their\r\nletters a day earlier. The coach left London at the usual time (8 P.M.),\r\narriving in Yarmouth at 11.40 A.M., returning at 3 P.M. on the same\r\nday.[410] The mails to Manchester and Liverpool travelled at the rate of\r\nnine miles an hour over the greater part of the road.[411] The average\r\nspeed varied from eight to nine miles an hour. To give the exact\r\nfigures, the highest speed attained in England was ten miles and five\r\nfurlongs an hour, the slowest six miles, and the average eight miles and\r\nseven furlongs.[412] In Ireland the highest speed attained by the mail\r\ncoaches was nine miles and one furlong an hour, the slowest speed six\r\nmiles and seven furlongs, and the average eight miles and two\r\nfurlongs.[413] Mail carts drawn by two horses were also used largely in\r\nIreland for the conveyance of the mails, and by these the speed was not\r\nso great. The highest speed made by them was seven miles and five\r\nfurlongs an hour, the slowest five miles and one furlong, and the\r\naverage six miles and three furlongs.[414] In Scotland the highest\r\nspeed was ten miles and four furlongs an hour, the slowest seven miles,\r\nand the average eight miles and two furlongs.[415]\r\n\r\n[408] London _Times_, 1817, Aug. 28, p. 2.\r\n\r\n[409] _Rep.

The packet left Holyhead twenty-five minutes\r\nlater for Howth. The packet left Howth at 4 P.M. for Holyhead, and the\r\nmails for London left Holyhead at 12.15 A.M. The passage across the\r\nIrish Sea took from five to eight hours. The London coach arrived in\r\nMilford at 5.27 A.M., travelling at a rate of eight miles an hour, and\r\ntwenty-five minutes after its arrival, the packet left for Dunmore.\r\nAnother left Dunmore with the mails at 12 P.M., and the coach left\r\nMilford for London at 7.30 P.M.[416] The London mail coach arrived at\r\nPortpatrick at 10.27 P.M., fifty hours and twenty-seven minutes from\r\nLondon. The packet did not leave Portpatrick until 6.10 A.M., after the\r\narrival of the Glasgow mail, which left Glasgow at 4.45 P.M., arriving\r\nat 5.6 A.M. The packet left Donaghadee at noon, and the mail left\r\nPortpatrick at 4 P.M., arriving in Glasgow at 6 A.M. Ordinarily the\r\npassage across took four hours. The London mail coach arrived in\r\nLiverpool at 6 P.M., twenty-two hours from London, and left at 10.30\r\nP.M. Packets sailed from Liverpool and Kingstown at 5 P.M. and 5.15\r\nP.M., the time for crossing being about fourteen hours. No London\r\nletters went via Liverpool until 1841.[417]\r\n\r\n[416] _Rep. Commrs._, 1831-32, xvii, pp. 7, 373-74.\r\n\r\n[417] _Ibid._, 1831-32, xvii, pp. 373-74.\r\n\r\nThe method used to ensure a rapid transmission of the mails by the\r\ncoaches was as follows: Time bills were issued to the guards of the\r\ndifferent coaches. On these bills were printed the speed that should be\r\nmade from stage to stage, and it was the guard's duty to fill in the\r\ntime made by the coach on which he rode. Penalties were inflicted for\r\nany mistakes which he might make or any failure on his part to leave the\r\nbill in the office at the end of his route. On some of the time bills it\r\nwas set forth that a fine of one shilling was payable by the proprietor\r\nfor each minute that the coach was late and he might recover it from the\r\nguard or coachman if the delay was due to the negligence of either of\r\nthem. The coachmen were ordered to make up any time lost on the road\r\nand to report the horse keepers if they were at fault.[418]\r\n\r\n[418] _Rep. Commrs._, 1837, xxxiv, 7th rep., app., nos. 40-45.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause for delay was the lack of close connection between the\r\nmail coaches and the packets to and from Ireland. In 1837 the London\r\nmail arrived in Holyhead at 11 P.M., but the packet did not leave for\r\nKingstown until 8 A.M., a change having been made in the time of\r\nsailing.[419] Letters from England were detained in Dublin eleven hours\r\nbefore their departure for the rest of the island.[420] More than one\r\nthird of the Irish letters for England left Kingstown by the day packet\r\nat 9 A.M., remaining in Holyhead from 3 P.M. to 4 A.M., with the\r\nexception of the letters for Chester and Manchester, which were\r\nforwarded by a special coach.[421]\r\n\r\n[419] _Ibid._, 1837, xxxiv, 7th rep., app., no. 11. The packet leaving\r\nHolyhead at 6.30 P.M. carried letters from Birmingham, brought by the\r\ncoach from that place, but took no London letters (_Acc. & P._, 1841,\r\nix, p. 9).\r\n\r\n[420] _Rep. Commrs._, 1831-32, xvii, p. 325.\r\n\r\n[421] _Ibid._, 1837, xxxiv, 7th rep., app., no. 11.\r\n\r\nThe packets from Liverpool started shortly before the arrival of the\r\nLondon mail. The Commissioners proposed that they should be detained\r\nuntil it had arrived, but this was not done until ten years later.[422]\r\nThe packets at Portpatrick always waited for the mails from Glasgow, and\r\nas these were nearly always late, letters from Carlisle and Northern\r\nEngland were necessarily detained.[423] The station at Milford had\r\nalways given the most trouble. From a financial point of view it was the\r\nleast satisfactory, and English letters for the south of Ireland often\r\nwent through Holyhead. The packet left Waterford[424] for Milford at 12\r\nP.M., arriving in Milford about noon, but the mail did not leave for\r\nLondon until 7.30 P.M.[425] English letters for Ireland via Milford were\r\ndetained from ten to thirteen hours in Waterford.[426]\r\n\r\n[422] _Ibid._, 1831-32, xvii, pp. 5-9; _Acc. & P._, 1841, xix.\r\n\r\n[423] _Rep. Commrs._, 1831-32, xvii, pp. 5-9.\r\n\r\n[424] Sometimes the packet left Dunmore. See _Rep. Commrs._, 1831-32,\r\nxvii, pp. 373-4.\r\n\r\n[425] _Ibid._, 1831-32, xvii, pp. 5-9, 373-74.\r\n\r\n[426] _Ibid._, p. 325.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of Penny Postage, the use of railways had only\r\nstarted. In 1837, it was objected that the railways could never be of\r\nmuch use in this respect because they could not travel at night for\r\nfear of accidents. In answer to this objection it was pointed out that\r\ntrains between Liverpool and Manchester and Leeds and Selby found no\r\ndifficulty in that respect.[427] In 1837, mails were carried between\r\nManchester and Liverpool at a rate of twenty miles an hour, and these\r\ntrains left both Liverpool and Manchester as late as 5 P.M.[428] The\r\nPostmaster-General was given authority by Parliament to require any\r\nrailway to carry mails either by ordinary or special train and to\r\nregulate the speed to the maximum of the fastest passenger train, as\r\nwell as to control places, times and duration of stoppage and the times\r\nof arrival, provided that such regulations were reasonable. He might\r\nrequire the exclusive use of a carriage, if necessary, provided either\r\nby the railway or himself as seemed better to himself. In 1844 he was\r\nallowed to order a speed not in excess of twenty-seven miles an hour but\r\nhe complained that he was unable to enforce his regulations although the\r\nspeed was increasing. In 1855 a parliamentary committee reported in\r\nfavour of a deduction of payment for irregularity on the part of the\r\nrailways and the fining of the Post Office for irregularity in dealing\r\nwith mail to be entrusted to the railways, the amounts of such\r\ndeductions and fines to be a matter of contract, and in addition it was\r\nadvised that the Postmaster-General's demands with reference to speed\r\nshould be certified by the Railway Department of the Board of Trade to\r\nbe consistent with safety. In conformity with this resolution, the\r\nPostmaster-General proposed to pay a bonus to the railways when their\r\ntrains were on time and to exact a penalty from either the railway or\r\nthe Post Office whichever were the offender, but the proposition was, as\r\na rule, not very favourably received by the railways.[429]\r\n\r\n[427] _Rep.

This order was probably temporary, being intended\r\nto furnish a means of communication only during Essex's expedition.[432]\r\nIn 1649 the port of departure for the Irish packets was changed from\r\nHolyhead to Portinllain in Carnarvon and at the same time the land\r\nstages were altered to meet the new conditions.[433] Prideaux reported\r\nthe same year that the cost of these packets averaged £600 a year.[434]\r\n\r\n[430] _Cal. S. P. Ire._, 1574-85, p. 401.\r\n\r\n[431] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 37 (15).\r\n\r\n[432] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1598-1601, p. 107.\r\n\r\n[433] _Ibid._, 1648-49, p. 210.\r\n\r\n[434] _Jo. H. C._, 1648-51, p. 385.\r\n\r\nIn 1653 the Council of State gave orders for the revival of the old\r\npacket service between Milford and Waterford. At the same time Chester\r\nwas substituted for Portinllain as the point of departure on the English\r\nside, and mails were carried weekly between the two countries by the\r\nMilford and Chester Packets.[435] The establishment of these boats was\r\nmade one of the conditions under which the post was farmed in the same\r\nyear.[436] The situation of Holyhead, however, was so much in its favour\r\nthat in 1693 a contract was signed for the conveyance of the mails\r\nbetween Holyhead and Dublin. Mr. Vickers, the contractor, agreed to\r\nmaintain three packet boats for this purpose for £450 a year. He also\r\nundertook to provide two boats for the mail service between Portpatrick\r\nand Donaghadee. When the Scotch was separated from the English Post\r\nOffice in 1695, three packet boats came under the control of\r\nScotland.[437] Upon the separation of the British and Irish Posts in\r\n1784, it was provided that each office should receive its own proportion\r\nof the inland postage collected on letters passing between the two\r\ncountries. The packet service between the two countries continued to be\r\nmanaged by the English Postmaster-General, to whom all receipts were\r\nforwarded. In return for this they were required to pay to the Irish\r\nOffice a sum not exceeding £4000 a year. This was to be the rule until\r\nIreland had established packet boats of her own.[438]\r\n\r\n[435] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1644, pp. 6, 29; 1641-43, p. 501.\r\n\r\n[436] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1652-53, pp. 312, 449.\r\n\r\n[437] _Cal. T. P._, 1557-1696, p. 308.\r\n\r\n[438] 24 Geo. III, c. 6.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Post Office, before the Act of Union, had employed boats\r\ncalled wherries for the despatch of special messengers and expresses to\r\nEngland. In the course of time they lost their special character and,\r\nafter 1801, were used to carry passengers and goods in opposition to the\r\nHolyhead packets. In 1813, Lees, the Secretary of the Irish Office,\r\ninformed the London Office that these wherries would henceforth be\r\nemployed to carry the Irish mails to Holyhead. This was actually done\r\nfor six weeks and the regular packets arrived on the English side\r\nwithout the mail, which was brought by boats that, as a rule, did not\r\narrive until after the coach had left for London. Lees may have been\r\nobstinate and ill advised but there was no doubt that he was acting\r\nentirely within his rights. The question then arose, should the Irish\r\nOffice receive that part of the £4000 due them while the Holyhead\r\npackets did not carry the mails? The Postmaster-General decided that\r\nthey should, much to Freeling's disgust. Lees had obtained his object,\r\nfor two years later Parliament passed an act increasing the amount\r\npayable to the Irish Office to £8000 a year.[439]\r\n\r\n[439] Joyce, pp. 380-83; 55 Geo. III, c. 145.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Restoration, two packet boats were employed between\r\nDeal and the Downs. They carried letters to and from the ships of the\r\nmerchant marine and the Royal Navy lying there. They also collected\r\nletters from vessels arriving from foreign ports and brought them to the\r\nshore whence they were transmitted by the General Post.[440] By an act\r\npassed in 1767 the Isle of Man was for the first time supplied with a\r\npostal service. A packet boat was to run between Whitehaven and the\r\nPort of Douglas in the island.[441] In 1828 sixteen packet boats were\r\nemployed in carrying mails between the coast towns and to and from the\r\noutlying islands of the United Kingdom. All of these boats were hired by\r\nthe Post Office, except those from Weymouth to Jersey and Guernsey.[442]\r\n\r\n[440] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1667-68, pp. 248, 249; Joyce, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[441] 7 Geo.

Commrs._, 1830, xiv, app., nos. 78, 80.\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century Dover was the port of departure and\r\narrival for letters to and from the continent, and Calais was the\r\ndistributing point on the other side, although the royal mail was\r\noccasionally conveyed between Rye and Dieppe.[443] From Calais the\r\nletters were carried to their destination by the English messengers to\r\nwhom they were entrusted. They took up post horses along the way, paying\r\nfor them as they proceeded, and often grumbling at the excessive charges\r\nwhich were demanded.[444] Letters from abroad directed to England were\r\nusually carried as far as Calais by foreign messengers. The foreign\r\nPostmaster-General would then send his bill to the English\r\nPostmaster-General for expenses so incurred.[445] Regular sailing\r\npackets were not used to carry the mails between Dover and Calais during\r\nthe sixteenth century, but merchant vessels were employed by the Post\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n[443] _Cal.

Hen.\r\nVIII_, i, 3639.\r\n\r\nWitherings' appointment as Foreign Postmaster-General in 1632 was made\r\nthe occasion for a report to Sir John Coke on the foreign postal\r\nservice. The immediate cause of the report was the fact that mails had\r\nnot arrived from Germany, the Hague and Brussels. The fault was laid\r\nupon the messengers, who were accused of \"minding their own peddling\r\ntraffic more than the service of the state or the merchants, omitting\r\nmany packages, sometimes staying for the vending of their own\r\ncommodities, many times through neglect or lying in tippling houses.\"\r\nThe report goes on to express confidence in Witherings and in his plan\r\nfor the reform of the foreign post.[446] In 1631, thirteen messengers\r\nwere employed to carry letters to the continent: three for France; six\r\nfor Germany, Italy and the Netherlands; and four, who travelled to Paris\r\nand other parts of France on special occasions.[447] The service which\r\nthey gave was inadequate and slow, and in 1633 the foreign post, at\r\nWitherings' suggestion, was ordered to be conducted on the following\r\nprinciples. Packet posts were to be appointed at suitable stages to run\r\nday and night without stopping. This was the plan which was commented\r\nupon favourably in the report to Sir John Coke. The Foreign\r\nPostmaster-General was to take the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, to\r\nhave an office in London, and to give notice at what time the public\r\nwere to bring in their letters for despatch to the continent. A register\r\nwas also to be kept, in which should be enrolled the names of all\r\npersons bringing letters, together with the names of those to whom they\r\nwere addressed. The letters themselves were placed in a packet and\r\nlocked and sealed with the Foreign Postmaster-General's seal. Letters\r\nfrom abroad for ambassadors residing in England and for the Government\r\nwere to be delivered at once, after which a table of all other letters\r\nwas to be set up for every one to see and demand his own.[448]\r\n\r\n[446] Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._, 12, app., pt. 1, p. 478.\r\n\r\n[447] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1631-33, p. 242; Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._, 12,\r\napp., pt. 2, p. 103.\r\n\r\n[448] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1631-33, p. 522.\r\n\r\nWitherings attempted next to come to some agreement with the postal\r\nofficials of foreign countries about the despatch of letters. In Calais\r\nhe met the Countess Taxis, secretary of the Postmaster of Ghent, and she\r\nagreed to settle stages between Antwerp and Calais. Witherings himself\r\nestablished stages between London and Dover. There had always been\r\ntrouble with the boatmen who conveyed the mail between Dover and Calais.\r\nWitherings reported that he had found a man, who for 40s. would wait for\r\nthe packet and depart with it at once, carrying nothing else. The\r\nmessengers hitherto employed between Antwerp and Calais were\r\ndismissed.[449] The arrangement in France for the carriage of letters to\r\nand from England was decidedly unique. Witherings obtained the\r\npermission of the French ambassador to settle stages in France\r\nhimself.[450]\r\n\r\n[449] Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._, 12, app., pt. 2, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[450] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1634-35, p. 193.\r\n\r\nIn 1644, King Charles, from his headquarters at Oxford, ordered sailing\r\npackets to be established at Weymouth to ply between that town and\r\nCherbourg. This was done ostensibly for the accommodation of the\r\nmerchants in the southwest of England. James Hicks was ordered to live\r\nin Weymouth for the purpose of exercising a general oversight over all\r\nletters going or coming by these packets. All dues must be paid before\r\nthey were allowed to depart and the masters were accountable to him for\r\npassage money. Postage was charged on all letters going to or coming\r\nfrom any part of England except those on His Majesty's service. No\r\nletters were to be sent from those parts of England in the hands of the\r\nrebels.[451]\r\n\r\n[451] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1644, pp. 6, 29.\r\n\r\nUntil 1638, Flanders was the only country with which England had come to\r\nan agreement concerning the mutual exchange of the correspondence of\r\neach. In that year, a similar agreement was concluded with de Nouveau,\r\nthe French Postmaster-General. All letters between England and France\r\nwere henceforth to pass through Dover, Calais, Boulogne, Abbeville, and\r\nAmiens. Both the French and English kings ratified this agreement, and\r\nall others were prohibited by them from infringing upon the monopolies\r\nenjoyed by the two Postmasters-General.[452] On special occasions, of\r\ncourse, both the French and English kings sent special messengers but\r\nthey were not used so often as before.[453] In 1640, the Governor of the\r\nMerchant Adventurers was asked to give his opinion upon the question of\r\nforeign correspondence concerning which there was considerable\r\ndissatisfaction, especially in the case of letters sent to Flanders and\r\nHolland. The Governor in his reply said that complaints had hitherto\r\nbeen restrained because of the connection of the state with the foreign\r\npost. He added that some time before a letter had come from the Court of\r\ntheir company at Rotterdam, complaining about the overcharging of the\r\nCompany's letters. He did not care to investigate the question alone but\r\nproposed that it be entrusted to a committee composed of two members\r\nfrom each of the great companies, the Merchant Adventurers, the Turkish,\r\nthe Eastland, and the French.[454] After the Restoration, matters were\r\nadjusted with de Nouveau and provision was made for the transmission of\r\nletters to England twice a week.[455] At the same time an attempt was\r\nmade to reach an understanding with the burgomaster of Amsterdam and the\r\nDutch ambassador for the conveyance of English letters to Germany, the\r\nEast, and Italy through Holland. Bishop, the English Postmaster-General,\r\nwas accused of accepting money for making this bargain and the proposed\r\nagreement did not materialize.[456] In 1665, Frizell was sent abroad to\r\ntalk over postal connections with de Nouveau and the Flemish\r\nPostmaster-General, de Taxis, between whom difficulties had arisen. De\r\nTaxis was reminded that letters from Holland for England passing through\r\nFlanders were not treated in accordance with the agreement made between\r\nEngland and Flanders.[457] The old contract was continued, for in 1693 a\r\nbill was presented to the English Post Office by the next in order of\r\nthe House of Thurn and Taxis, referring to the former agreement. £2711\r\nwas then due to the Flemish Postmaster-General and, as the bill was\r\npresented in the form of a petition signed by the Prince of the House\r\nand his brothers and sisters, there was probably some difficulty\r\nexperienced in collecting it.[458] The Dutch were not satisfied with\r\nreceiving letters through Flanders, and in 1667 we find the\r\nPostmaster-General of Holland in Harwich, arranging for a direct service\r\nwith England, which was established in the following year.[459] Letters\r\nto and from Holland might go via Calais through France and Flanders, or\r\nby sailing packet to Nieuport and thence through Flanders, or directly\r\nfrom Harwich to Helvoetsluys. The mail for Holland left London every\r\nTuesday and Thursday night. The route was along the Yarmouth road as far\r\nas Colchester and then directly to Harwich. The Harwich boats were\r\nstopped for a short time in 1672,[460] but after William's accession\r\nthey were in such constant service that it was necessary to hire extra\r\nboats.[461] Orders were often given to delay them until the arrival of\r\nan express from the King and on other occasions they were hurried off\r\nbefore their regular time for departure.[462]\r\n\r\n[452] _Rep.

This was done in England,\r\nbut in France the foreign mail continued to be sent at the regular time\r\nof departure and, as there was only one mail a day, English letters\r\nmight have to remain in Calais for nearly twenty-four hours, if the\r\npacket from Dover happened to be late. Cotton and Frankland remonstrated\r\nbut Mr. Pajot, the French Postmaster-General, returned no answer. The\r\nEnglish Postmasters-General had agreed to pay about £2500 a year to Mr.\r\nPajot for the conveyance of English letters through France. One or two\r\ninstalments were paid before the war broke out.[463] Nothing further was\r\ndone until after the Treaty of Utrecht, when a commission was sent to\r\nFrance to negotiate a new postal agreement. Pajot refused to accept a\r\nlump sum and declared that each letter passing through France must pay\r\nthe ordinary postage according to the French rates. Objection was taken\r\nto this as the French rates were higher than the English, but objections\r\nwere of no avail. Pajot, who carried matters with a high hand, gained\r\nhis point. By the act of 1711, the postage for a single letter through\r\nFrance to Italy was 15_d._, and by the terms of the new treaty with\r\nFrance, 21 sous would have to be paid by the English Postmasters-General\r\nfor the conveyance of a letter through France.[464]\r\n\r\n[463] Joyce, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[464] _Ibid._, p. 139.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of the sailing packets between England and France in 1689\r\nhad interrupted postal communication between England and Spain, since\r\nthe regular route lay through Calais. Accordingly, packet boats were\r\nhired to ply between Falmouth and the Groyne.[465] After the Methuen\r\ntreaty had been signed and while England and France were struggling in\r\nthe Spanish Netherlands, it was proposed to replace the old boats\r\nbetween Falmouth and Lisbon by new. In 1703 a weekly packet service,\r\nsupplied by four boats, was established between England and\r\nPortugal.[466]\r\n\r\n[465] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1691-92, p. 97.\r\n\r\n[466] _Cal. T. P._, 1702-07, p. 94.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the war, Cotton and Frankland contracted with Mr. Macky to\r\nfurnish five boats to carry the mails between England, France, and\r\nFlanders for three years. In 1701, the contract was extended to five\r\nyears for £1400 a year. Macky was to provide boats and men but not\r\nprovisions and equipment. In case war broke out, the contract would\r\nbecome void at once. War did break out the next year,[467] and during\r\nthe war the packet boats from Harwich to Holland were kept very busy.\r\nThey had been large boats, well manned and formidable enough to take\r\ncare of themselves in an emergency. They seem even to have become the\r\naggressors at times. William, himself, as was natural, felt a warm\r\ninterest in them. A stranger in a strange land, misunderstood and\r\npersonally unpopular, they were the link between him and his home. He\r\nthought that speedier boats should be built and that when pursued they\r\nshould attempt to escape rather than stand up to their pursuers. The\r\ngovernment had four narrow, low boats built for purposes of speed. The\r\nsailors complained that the new boats were so low in the water that they\r\nwere constantly being swept by the waves and they themselves were\r\ndrenched all the time. There is no doubt that William's move was in the\r\nright direction, and the men were placated by an increase in their\r\nwages. This could be done the more easily since the new boats were\r\nsmaller than the old and carried fewer men.[468]\r\n\r\n[467] _Ibid._, 1702-07, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[468] Joyce, pp. 75, 76. Mr. Vanderpoel, postmaster at the Brill, was\r\nappointed by the king to take charge of all letters and despatches sent\r\nby or to their Majesties by the Harwich boats (_Cal. S. P. D._, 1691-92,\r\np. 404; _Cal. T. P._, 1702-07, pp. 19, 33).\r\n\r\nAt the time of the War of the Austrian Succession, the Dover packets\r\nwere supplied by a man named Pybus. He agreed to carry mails,\r\npassengers, and expresses from Dover to Calais and Ostend. If he could\r\nnot reach the latter place by sea he was to land the mails and have them\r\nforwarded overland. He was to receive as pay the fares of all\r\npassengers, but so many officers and soldiers had to be transported free\r\nthat he was paid what the Treasury considered that he lost by them.[469]\r\nA position in one of the packets was so dangerous in time of war that a\r\nfund was provided for the widows and children of the killed and for the\r\nsupport of the wounded. This was met by deducting 10_d._ a month from\r\nthe pay of each seaman.[470]\r\n\r\n[469] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1742-45, p.509.\r\n\r\n[470] _Cal. T. P._, 1708-14, p. 3.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, as a war measure, packets were established between Falmouth,\r\nGibraltar, and Malta.[471] It was understood that the regular service to\r\nPortugal should be discontinued at the same time. In 1812 during\r\nWellington's campaign in Portugal and Spain, the Post Office announced\r\nthat sailing packets would be despatched to Corunna every\r\nfortnight.[472] From Corunna they proceeded to Lisbon before returning\r\nto Falmouth. There was some complaint from the mercantile interests on\r\naccount of the stop at Corunna, since the merchants were more interested\r\nin the Lisbon markets than in keeping up communication with Wellington's\r\narmy.[473]\r\n\r\n[471] 43 Geo. III, c. 73.\r\n\r\n[472] London _Times_, 1812, Aug. 31, p. 2.\r\n\r\n[473] _Ibid._, 1813, Aug. 22, p. 2.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1813, Napoleon had lost control over Europe. The Dutch had\r\nfreed themselves from French domination. On November 26th a Dutch mail\r\nwas made up at the Post Office and despatched for Harwich. The regular\r\npacket boats were reëstablished and were ordered to land the mails at\r\nScheveningen, a small fishing town three miles from the Hague.[474]\r\nFollowing Napoleon's expulsion to Elba, postal communications with\r\nFrance were resumed. Mails were despatched from Dover four times a week,\r\non Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, leaving London at 11 P.M.\r\non Tuesday and Friday and at 7 P.M. on Wednesday and Thursday.[475]\r\nThirteen sailing vessels were stationed at Harwich in 1828, all of them\r\nhired permanently. Nine sailed between Harwich and Helvoetsluys, four\r\nbetween Harwich and Gothenburg.[476]\r\n\r\n[474] _Ibid._, 1813, Nov. 29, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[475] _Rep. Commrs._, 1829, xi, p. 232; _Acc. & P._, 1817, p. 11; London\r\n_Times_, 1814, April 18, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[476] _Rep. Commrs._, 1830, xiv, app., no. 78.\r\n\r\nThe London merchants in 1837 complained that no mails were made up in\r\nParis for London on Wednesday and Thursday. The mails from Spain, Italy,\r\nand Switzerland arrived in Paris on Tuesday and Friday, and Tuesday's\r\nmails were not despatched until Friday. An arrangement was asked for by\r\nwhich a daily post might be established between Paris and London. They\r\npointed out that there was a daily post from Paris to Calais, a daily\r\npacket service and a daily post from Dover to London.[477] English\r\nletters for France arrived in Dover daily at 5 A.M., except on Wednesday\r\nand Saturday, were despatched to Calais at once and left Calais at noon\r\nfor Boulogne and Paris. On post nights,[478] letters did not leave\r\nLondon until midnight, arrived in Dover at 10 A.M., and were often not\r\nin time for the Paris mail, which left Calais at noon.[479] The two\r\npackets between Dover and Ostend carried the mails four times a\r\nweek.[480] By virtue of a treaty with Belgium, these packets conveyed\r\nletters both ways and the Belgium Government paid £1000 a year as its\r\npart of the expenses. The Dover-Calais boats on the other hand carried\r\nletters only to Calais, and not from Calais to Dover.[481] Letters from\r\nBelgium to Dover went first to London and this held true of any letters\r\nfrom Belgium to England via Dover.[482]\r\n\r\n[477] London _Times_, 1830, May 21, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[478] Post nights were probably on Wednesday and Saturday nights.\r\n\r\n[479] London _Times_, 1837, Jan. 14, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[480] _Rep. Commrs._, 1836, xxviii, 6th rep., p. 5.\r\n\r\n[481] _Ibid._, 1836, xxviii, 6th rep., p. 5.\r\n\r\n[482] _Ibid._, 1836, xxviii, 6th rep., p. 7.\r\n\r\nIt was provided in 1835 that, after the Postmaster-General had entered\r\ninto an agreement with any foreign state to collect and account for the\r\nBritish postage on letters sent from the United Kingdom to any such\r\nstate, it should be optional for a person sending such a letter to pay\r\nthe whole amount of postage in advance or to pay the British postage\r\nonly, as had hitherto been the custom, or to pay neither. The entire\r\npostage on letters from abroad might also be paid in one sum and the\r\npart due the foreign state was then handed over by the English\r\nPostmaster-General.[483] In the following year such a treaty was\r\nconcluded with France, the English colonies also being included in the\r\narrangement. It was agreed that each country should account to the other\r\naccording to the method of reckoning postage of the country to which the\r\npayment was made, a settlement to be concluded every three months.[484]\r\n\r\n[483] 5 and 6 Wm. IV., c. 25.\r\n\r\n[484] London _Times_, 1836, June 20, p. 5. In accounting to France for\r\nletters sent there postpaid, England agreed to consider as a single\r\nletter any enclosure or enclosures weighing not more than a quarter of\r\nan ounce, according to the French method.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century William Dummer entered into a\r\ncontract to supply packet boats for use between England and the West\r\nIndies. For this service Dummer provided five boats, each one of 150\r\ntons and carrying 50 men. Each was to make three round trips a year,\r\nthus giving fifteen sailings every twelve months from both England and\r\nthe West Indies.[485] These boats were to make Falmouth their home port,\r\nbut they often kept on to Plymouth, probably because it was a better\r\nplace to dispose of their smuggled goods.[486] Poor Dummer was\r\nexceedingly unfortunate with his West India boats. The first one to sail\r\nwas captured on her maiden trip. The receipts did not come up to his\r\nexpectations. He had supposed that to double the receipts he had only\r\nto double the rates, but like other men before and after him he had to\r\nlearn the effect of higher rates on correspondence.[487] In 1706 he\r\nwrote that it was a losing contract,[488] and in the same year the\r\nGovernment released him from the agreement and paid him for two of his\r\nlost packets.[489] From a total of fourteen boats provided for the\r\npacket service, he had lost nine. The Postmasters-General recommended\r\nthat for the future the packets should leave and arrive at Bideford,\r\nwhich was less exposed to the enemies' privateers than either Falmouth\r\nor Plymouth.[490]\r\n\r\n[485] _Cal. T. P._, 1702-07, p. 64.\r\n\r\n[486] _Ibid._, p.57.\r\n\r\n[487] Joyce, pp. 79, 81.\r\n\r\n[488] _Cal. T.

In that year the Postmasters-General reported to\r\nthe Treasury in favour of regular packets between Falmouth and some port\r\nin the West Indies. The report was agreed to, and orders were given for\r\ntwo new boats to be supplied and for the two boats between Lisbon and\r\nGibraltar to be transferred there.[491] The agent at Falmouth was\r\nordered to see that each boat sailed with its full complement of men, as\r\nthe captains were accustomed to discharge some of the crew just before\r\nsailing and pocket their wages. He was also to make sure that each of\r\nthe boats sailing from Falmouth for Lisbon, the West Indies, or North\r\nAmerica was British built and navigated by British seamen. He must keep\r\na journal, in which should be entered the time that he received and\r\ndelivered mails and expresses, how the wind and tide served, when the\r\nboats arrived and departed, and any delay in sailing which might occur.\r\nThe captains were ordered to make returns after each voyage of the\r\nnumber of men on board. The crew while on shore should receive their\r\naccustomed wages and \"victuals\" and, if any were discharged, a return\r\nwas to be made of such discharge, the money due them being turned over\r\nto the pension fund. It had become customary for the captains not to pay\r\nthe men while they were on shore and to retain the money owing them.\r\nFinally the agent was to see that the packet boats proceeded to the\r\nRoads the day before the mail was expected from London.[492] Packets had\r\nalready been employed to convey mails to and from Madeira and\r\nBrazil[493] and within the next few years others were hired to ply\r\nbetween Falmouth, Buenos Ayres,[494] Colombia, Mexico, San Domingo, and\r\nCuba, and between the British West Indies, Colombia, and Mexico.[495]\r\n\r\n[491] _Cal. T. B. and P._, 1742-45, pp. 705, 707.\r\n\r\n[492] _Jo. H. C._, 1787, pp. 816, 817.\r\n\r\n[493] 48 Geo. III, c. 116.\r\n\r\n[494] 5 Geo. IV, c. 10.\r\n\r\n[495] 6 Geo. IV, c. 44.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, the Postmaster-General was given permission by Act of\r\nParliament to establish sailing packets between the United Kingdom, the\r\nCape of Good Hope, Mauritius, and that part of the East Indies embraced\r\nwithin the charter of the East India Company. Packet rates were also\r\ncharged for letters carried by war vessels and by vessels of the\r\ncompany, but in the former case the consent of the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty for the use of their ships had first to be obtained. Letters\r\nto and from China must go by vessels of the company and no others. With\r\nthe consent of the Commissioners of the Treasury or any three of them,\r\nthe Postmaster-General might allow the regular sailing packets to import\r\nand export all goods, which might legally be imported or exported, but\r\nin the case of tea, only enough for the use of those on board should be\r\ncarried.[496]\r\n\r\n[496] 55 Geo. III, c. 153.\r\n\r\nWhen Cotton and Frankland were appointed Postmasters-General in 1691,\r\nthe following sailing packets were in commission.[497]\r\n\r\n                      {Flanders, 2 boats.\r\n  Between England and {Holland,  3\r\n                      {Ireland,  3\r\n  Between Scotland and Ireland,  2\r\n  At Deal for the Downs,[498]    2\r\n\r\nIn 1689, the King had ordered the boats between Dover and Calais to be\r\ndiscontinued until further notice. This was done \"on account of the late\r\ndiscovery of treasonable designs against the Government\" and the war\r\nwith France. His Majesty \"preferred that all interchange of letters with\r\nFrance should cease.\"[499]\r\n\r\n[497] Letters were sent to the colonies by private vessels. The method\r\nused for sending letters to America was as follows. Masters of vessels\r\nbound for America used to hang up a bag in the coffee-houses, in which\r\nletters were placed. A fee of one penny was charged for a single letter\r\nand 2_d._ for a double letter or parcel in excess of a single letter\r\n(_Cal. T. P._, 1697-1702, p. 77).\r\n\r\n[498] Thos. DeLaune, _Present State of London_, 1681, p. 343.\r\n\r\n[499] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1689-90, p. 301.\r\n\r\nIn 1744, the sailing packets of Great Britain and Ireland, excluding\r\nthose employed in the domestic service, were as follows: four boats\r\nbetween Falmouth and Lisbon, four on the Harwich station, six between\r\nDover and Calais or Ostend, two between Gibraltar and Lisbon, and two on\r\nthe Minorca station. The use of sailing packets to Gibraltar and Minorca\r\nwas made necessary by the war. From twenty to twenty-six additional men\r\nwere added to each of the eighteen packets as a protection against the\r\nenemy, and the total additional yearly charge was £7045.[500] This is\r\none of the items which made postal expenses run so high in time of war,\r\nto say nothing of the packets captured by the enemy. The three boats\r\nbetween Dover and Calais were sent to Harwich, Helvoetsluys, and Ostend\r\nfor the time being.[501]\r\n\r\n[500] _Cal. T. B. and P._, 1742-45, p. 518.\r\n\r\n[501] _Ibid._, 1742-45, p. 523.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the Post Office until 1821 had been to contract for the\r\nsupply of packet boats, paying only a nominal sum for their hire and\r\nallowing the contractors to have the receipts from passengers. In 1818 a\r\nprivate company established steamboats between Holyhead and Dublin, and\r\nthe public preferred these to the sailing packets. The number of\r\npassengers by the government packets fell off nearly one half. Something\r\nhad to be done at once, for, as the receipts from fares decreased, the\r\ncontractors clamoured for higher pay. The steamboat company offered to\r\ncarry the mails for £4 a trip and later for nothing, but the Post Office\r\ndetermined to have steam packets of its own.[502] Two, built by Boulton\r\nand Watt, under the inspection of the Navy Board, were placed on the\r\nHolyhead station in 1821, and these, as well as those introduced later\r\non the other stations, were the property of the Crown.[503]\r\n\r\n[502] _Rep. Commrs._, 1830, xiv, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[503] _Parl. Papers_, 1822, vi, 417, pp. 117 f.\r\n\r\nThe fares by the steam packets at Holyhead were fixed at the same rates\r\nas those charged by the company's boats and these fares were somewhat\r\nhigher than those formerly charged by the sailing packets. For instance,\r\nthe fee for a cabin passenger had been one guinea, for a horse one\r\nguinea, and for a coach three guineas. These were now raised to £1\r\n5_s._, £1 10_s._, and £3 5_s._ respectively. The new rates, which were\r\nso fixed in order not to expose the company to undue competition, had\r\nnot been long enforced before the Select Committee on Irish\r\nCommunications reported against them, and the Post Office reduced them\r\nto the old figures.[504]\r\n\r\n[504] Joyce, pp. 384-85. In a debate in the House on the Holyhead rates,\r\nParnell said that they limited the use of the steamboats to the rich\r\n(_Parl. Deb._, 3d ser., x, coll. 684-85).\r\n\r\nIn 1822 steam packets were placed on the Dover station, in 1824 they\r\nwere introduced at Milford, in 1826 at Liverpool and Portpatrick, and in\r\n1827 at Weymouth.[505] At Liverpool also a private company had offered\r\nto carry the mails but the offer was refused. This refusal, as well as\r\nthe refusal to accept the Holyhead Company's offer, was condemned in a\r\nreport of the Commissioners.[506] The new Liverpool packets ran from\r\nLiverpool to Kingstown, the Holyhead packets from Holyhead to Kingstown\r\nand Howth.[507] In 1828 the steam packets owned by the Crown numbered\r\neighteen. They were distributed as follows: four at Liverpool, two of\r\n300, one of 301 and one of 327 tons, all of 140 horse power; six at\r\nHolyhead, varying from 230 to 237 tons, all of 80 horse power; four at\r\nMilford, varying from 189 to 237 tons, all of 80 horse power; two at\r\nPortpatrick of 130 tons and 40 horse power; and two at Dover of 110 tons\r\nand 50 horse power.[508] Two years later, three steam packets were added\r\nto the Weymouth station.[509] In 1836, the Post Office had in use\r\ntwenty-six steam packets, one having been added at Liverpool, three at\r\nDover, and an extra one was kept for contingencies.[510]\r\n\r\n[505] _Acc. & P._, 1834, xlix, pp. 1, 156.\r\n\r\n[506] _Rep.

The total\r\ndisbursements for the Holyhead, Liverpool, Milford, and Portpatrick\r\nstations from 1821 to 1829 were £681,648, the receipts for the same\r\nperiod being only £250,999.[511] From 1832 to 1837 the disbursements for\r\nall the steam packets were £396,669, receipts £180,167.[512] The Milford\r\nboats were the least productive of any. From 1824 to 1836, the\r\nexpenditure for that station was £220,986, the receipts only £26,592.\r\nThe Commissioners had pointed out that not only was the practice of\r\nbuilding and owning its own boats a mistake on the part of the Post\r\nOffice, but they were very badly managed. For example, the stores for\r\nthe Holyhead station were obtained from the postmaster at Liverpool, who\r\ninvariably charged too much for them.[513] At Portpatrick the goods were\r\nsupplied and the accounts checked in a very irregular manner.[514] At\r\nDover the supplies were ordered by the mates, engineers, etc., as they\r\nwere needed and the bills paid by the Post Office. There was no control\r\nover these officers, the accounts were not examined, and the bills were\r\nnot certified by the commanders. There was no proof that the goods were\r\neven delivered. The agent, who forwarded the bills, was not a seaman nor\r\nhad he any knowledge of ships' stores.[515] At Weymouth, where there\r\nwere three steam packets for Jersey and Guernsey, conditions were\r\nbetter. The agent was a practical seaman, the demands for supplies were\r\nexamined by him before being granted, and were signed by him, by the\r\ncommander, and by the engineers or whoever needed them. The\r\nCommissioners also protested against sending the Weymouth boats so far\r\nfor repairs as Holyhead, which was the regular repair station of the\r\nPost Office. Apart from the steam packets stationed at Holyhead,\r\nLiverpool, Milford, Portpatrick, Weymouth, and Dover, all the other\r\npackets employed by the Post Office were hired permanently or\r\ntemporarily.[516]\r\n\r\n[511] _Acc. & P._, 1834, xlix, p. 1; _Rep.

The merchant marine of\r\nEngland had been increasing with her growing commerce, and provision was\r\nmade in the acts of 1657 and 1660 for the carriages of letters by\r\nprivate vessels. By the latter of these acts the conveyance of letters\r\nto foreign countries had been restricted to English ships under a\r\npenalty of £100 for every offence. It was decided in 1671, on the\r\noccasion of the wreck of one of the regular Irish packets, that it would\r\nbe better to use a Dutch-built ship on account of its being much more\r\nseaworthy in the choppy swell of the Irish sea. Accordingly an\r\norder-in-council was issued, allowing a vessel built in Holland to be\r\nused, and providing for its naturalization.[517] By the act of 1660,\r\nletters arriving in private vessels were to be given to the postmaster\r\nat the port of arrival so that they might be forwarded to London to be\r\ndespatched to their destination after being charged with the postage\r\ndue. Masters of vessels were offered no inducement to deliver the\r\nletters to the postmaster nor was any liability incurred by neglecting\r\nto do so. The post farmers, however, agreed to pay a penny for every\r\nletter delivered by a captain on his arrival. This was the origin of\r\nship letter money.[518]\r\n\r\n[517] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1671, p. 203. In 1793, owing to a scarcity of\r\nEnglish vessels and as a war measure, permission was given to send\r\nEnglish letters to Spain and Portugal by means of Spanish ships (33 Geo.\r\nIII, c. 60).\r\n\r\n[518] Joyce, p. 73.\r\n\r\nNo attempt had ever been made to collect postage on letters conveyed by\r\nprivate ships except for the distance which such letters might be\r\ncarried by the regular posts within the kingdom.[519] In 1799 an act was\r\npassed under the following title: \"An Act for the more sure conveyance\r\nof ship letters and for granting to His Majesty certain rates of postage\r\nthereon.\" The Postmasters-General were given authority by this act to\r\nforward letters and packages by other vessels than the sailing packets.\r\nOn letters brought in by such vessels, 4_d._ was to be charged for a\r\nsingle letter and so in proportion. This was to be in addition to the\r\ninland postage and 2_d._ was to be paid to the master for every letter\r\nhanded over by him to the Post Office. The net revenue so arising was to\r\nbe paid into the Exchequer. No postage was charged on letters carried\r\nout of the kingdom by private vessels[520] until 1832, when permission\r\nwas given to charge packet rates. It was forbidden to send letters by\r\nthese ships except through the Post Office unless such letters concerned\r\nonly the goods on board.[521] In 1835 that part of the act of 1711\r\nforbidding letters to be sent out of the kingdom except in British ships\r\nwas repealed.[522]\r\n\r\n[519] It is true that by the act of 1711, a penny was to be charged for\r\nevery ship letter; but this was to go to the master of the ship.\r\n\r\n[520] 39 Geo. III, c. 76.\r\n\r\n[521] 2 Wm. IV, c. 15.\r\n\r\n[522] 5 and 6 Wm. IV, c. 25.\r\n\r\nThe sailing packets were ordinarily allowed to carry passengers and\r\nfreight, for which fixed rates were charged. In case of trouble with\r\nany foreign power, the masters were generally forbidden to allow their\r\npackets to be used as passenger boats.[523] During King William's war,\r\nthe Harwich-Helvoetsluys packets carried recruits free to the scene of\r\nactivities.[524] They had also been guilty of bringing dutiable goods\r\ninto the country and paying no duty on them. This made the customs\r\nofficials indignant, especially as the Post Office authorities would not\r\nallow them to search the packets on their arrival. By an act passed in\r\n1662, no ship, vessel, or boat ordinarily employed for the carriage of\r\nletters was allowed to import or export any goods, unless permission had\r\nbeen given by the customs officials, under a penalty of £100 to be paid\r\nby the master of the offending packet boat.[525] It had been agreed\r\nbetween Dummer and the Post Office that he should carry no more than\r\nfive tons of merchandise outward bound nor more than ten tons when\r\nhomeward bound. The Commissioners of the Customs in 1708 advised the\r\nLord High Treasurer that if he gave licences to the packet boats to\r\ncarry goods[526] it would be necessary to comply with the law and\r\nsubject the boats to searchers, rules, and penalties as the merchantmen\r\nwere. They proposed that the agreement made with Dummer be applied to\r\nall the packets. They pointed out that if this were done, all friction\r\nbetween the customs and Post Office might be avoided.[527] In 1732, the\r\ndifficulty assumed a new form over the question as to the carriage of\r\ndutiable goods by mail. Diamonds had recently been discovered in Brazil\r\nand they were exported to England via Spain. It had also become\r\ncustomary to send fine laces by post. We, who have become used to\r\nintolerant customs' regulations, can hardly appreciate the indignation\r\naroused by the desire of the customs' authorities to search the mails.\r\nIt was the rule at that time for the Controller of the Foreign Office to\r\nlay a tax of 1 per cent upon packages which he thought had lace or\r\ndiamonds in them. The customs officials seized twenty-one parcels of\r\ndiamonds in a mail bag, coming from Lisbon in the packet _Hanover_. The\r\nPostmasters-General were very indignant and wrote to the Treasury that\r\nthey \"would not have it left to a customs' house officer to break open\r\nthe King's mail, which has never been done before.\"[528] Evidently the\r\ncustoms officials had exceeded their authority and the matter was\r\ncompromised by the appointment of a sub-controller of the Foreign Post\r\nOffice to act under the authority of the Customs Commissioners and\r\nreceive the duties on diamonds and other jewels and precious stones\r\nimported in the packet boats.[529] In a report of the\r\nPostmasters-General somewhat earlier, we are informed of a payment of\r\n£1087 made by them to the Receiver-General of the Customs. This amount\r\ncovered four fifths of the gross duty on diamonds and laces, which had\r\ncome by the sailing packets during four years, one fifth having been\r\ndeducted for postage.[530]\r\n\r\n[523] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1650, p. 540.\r\n\r\n[524] _Ibid._, 1691-92, pp. 29, 137.\r\n\r\n[525] 13 and 14 Chas. II, c. 11.\r\n\r\n[526] Goods were not supposed to be carried unless such a licence had\r\nbeen obtained. Some Jews, coming from Calais on the packet boat, had\r\nbrought a few spectacles with them, on the sale of which they said that\r\ntheir support depended. The spectacles were confiscated (_Cal. T. B. and\r\nP._, 1739-41, p. 61).\r\n\r\n[527] _Cal. T. P._, 1708-14, p. 74.\r\n\r\n[528] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1731-34, p. 223.\r\n\r\n[529] _Ibid._, 1731-34, p. 242.\r\n\r\n[530] _Ibid._, 1731-34, p. 234.\r\n\r\nBy a section of the act of 1784, letters or packages from abroad\r\nsuspected of containing dutiable articles were to be taken by the\r\npostmaster to a Justice of the Peace. He was to take an oath that he\r\nsuspected that dutiable goods were contained in the letter or packet. In\r\nthe presence of the justice he was then to cut a slit two inches long in\r\nthe parcel to permit examination of the contents. If his suspicions\r\nseemed to be confirmed he might slit the cover entirely open and if\r\nanything dutiable were found it must be destroyed. The letter was then\r\nforwarded to the Commissioner of the Customs in order that proceedings\r\nmight be taken against those implicated. If nothing was found, the\r\nletter was to be sent to the person to whom it was addressed, under the\r\nmagistrate's cover, with no extra charge for postage.[531]\r\n\r\n[531] 24 Geo. III, session 2, c. 37.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, the packet stations in England were conducted on\r\ndivergent principles. The supplies for the Harwich packets were advanced\r\ndirectly by the Government through the Postmaster-General. When the War\r\nof the Austrian Succession broke out, a treasury warrant was issued for\r\nthe supply of military stores and eight additional men for each of the\r\nHarwich boats.[532] At Falmouth, the agent supplied all necessaries.\r\nNeither plan was entirely free from objection. When the agent acted as\r\nvictualler he naturally tried to make as much as possible out of his\r\ncontract, and there were frequent complaints from the men on the\r\nFalmouth boats concerning the quality and quantity of the food. At\r\nHarwich, the drawbacks of the other method, under which the Post Office\r\ndid its own victualling, were quite as marked. No bill for provisions\r\nrepresented what they had actually cost. A percentage was habitually\r\nadded to the actual cost and this percentage went into the pockets of\r\nthose by whom the goods had been ordered.[533]\r\n\r\n[532] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1742-45, p. 55.\r\n\r\n[533] Joyce, pp. 95 f.\r\n\r\nThe postal abuses which came to light in 1787 were more flagrant in\r\nconnection with the packet service than in any other department of the\r\nPost Office. The Secretary himself was not only a large owner in the\r\nboats, but as agent he received 2-1/2 per cent of the gross total\r\nexpenditure. From 1770 to 1787, this had amounted to £1,038,133, from\r\nwhich he had received over £25,000. Besides this, his salary amounted to\r\n£1000 a year and there was an annuity of £100 attached to his office. He\r\nhad become too old to perform his duties, but instead of being\r\nsuperannuated another person was appointed to assist him.[534]\r\n\r\n[534] _Fin. Rep._, 1797, no. 7, p. 5.\r\n\r\nThe Sailors' Pension Fund was grossly mismanaged. Each sailor's monthly\r\ncontribution had been raised from 10_d._ to 2_s._ and then 3_s._ After\r\ntwenty years' service, the man who had kept up his payments was entitled\r\nto receive £4 or £5 a year. The names of dead people were retained on\r\nthe list of pensioners, fictitious names were added, and there seems no\r\ndoubt that the agent retained the money ostensibly paid out in their\r\nnames.[535] The agent at Falmouth had a salary of £230 a year and £160\r\nin perquisites, £100 of which were paid to the former agent's widow. The\r\nlate agent had received £430 a year in perquisites in addition to the\r\nregular £390 less £40 for a clerk and an assistant postmaster, making\r\n£780 in all, certainly a comfortable salary for a packet agent at that\r\ntime. The £430 was made up by an involuntary contribution of five\r\nguineas from each of the captains of the twenty-two packet boats and the\r\nwages of one man from each boat. The latter sum was obtained by\r\ndismissing the men, whose wages still continued to be paid--to the\r\nagent. Smuggling had become by no means uncommon among the Falmouth\r\nboats, the carriage of the mails being considered of secondary\r\nimportance. They often arrived when least expected, or they might not\r\narrive for days at a time, although the wind and weather were\r\nfavourable.[536]\r\n\r\n[535] _Jo. H. C._, 1787, p. 116.\r\n\r\n[536] _Jo. H. C._, 1787, pp. 815-16.\r\n\r\nFares for passengers were not always collected, but a moderate payment\r\nto the captains would ensure a passage as they were allowed to carry\r\ntheir friends free and the payment readily secured the privilege\r\ndesired. The agents also profited by the sale of passes.[537] There were\r\nmore boats on the Falmouth station than necessary, and, although they\r\nranged in size from 150 to 300 tons, the same number of men were\r\nemployed on each. The Secretary of the Post Office, from whose report\r\nthese facts about the packets are derived, proposed that three or four\r\nof the boats should be taken off, thus effecting a saving of £6000 or\r\n£8000. In case it should be considered expedient to employ regular\r\npacket boats to Quebec and Halifax, N. S., they might be placed on those\r\nstations. No deductions were made for the hire of boats when they were\r\nunemployed, either when being repaired or when under seizure for\r\nsmuggling.[538]\r\n\r\n[537] _Ibid._, 1787, pp. 815-16. Anthony Todd, Secretary of the Post\r\nOffice, writing to Charles Cox in Harwich said that \"several persons\r\ngoing from Helvoetsluys to Harwich, who are well able to pay full fare,\r\nhave given money for half, free and poor passes, and larger sums have\r\nbeen taken for passes than are allowed by the Postmaster-General\" (_Jo.\r\nH. C._, 1787, p. 805).\r\n\r\n[538] _Ibid._, 1787, p. 205.\r\n\r\nThe result of these exposures was a series of reforms started in 1793.\r\nBy 1797 the Post Office was able to report that orders had been issued\r\nforbidding any official to own a sailing packet or have a share in any\r\nof them. Orders were given to pay the sailors regularly throughout the\r\nwhole year. The 2-1/2 per cent on all expenditure, formerly paid to the\r\nSecretary, was abolished. Finally all salaries were henceforth to be in\r\nlieu of every emolument.[539]\r\n\r\n[539] _Fin. Rep._, 1797, no. 7, pp. 52-65.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, the expenses for packet boats amounted to £45,666 a year. This\r\nwas reduced in the following year to £36,940, but from 1795 expenses\r\nbegan to increase, owing to losses during the war and the necessity for\r\nplacing the boats on a war footing.[540] In time of peace, a Falmouth\r\npacket of 179 tons carried twenty-one men, including officers, at a\r\ntotal expenditure for men, interest, insurance, and wear and tear, of\r\n£1681.[541] In time of war, she carried twenty-eight men, all of whom\r\nwere paid higher wages, and other expenses were also higher, bringing\r\nthe total expenses for each packet to £2112 a year.[542] For a packet of\r\nseventy tons the expenses during peace and war were respectively £536\r\nand £862.[543] It is not surprising then that the cost for all the\r\npacket boats had risen in 1796 to £77,599. The Falmouth boats were\r\nresponsible for £60,444 of this, the rest being divided amongst the\r\nDover, Harwich, Donaghadee, Milford, Weymouth, and Holyhead packets and\r\nthe West India schooners.[544] The salaries paid to the agents in 1796\r\namounted to £3412. They were stationed at Lisbon, Falmouth, Yarmouth\r\n(instead of Harwich and Dover), Weymouth, Jamaica, Halifax, N. S., and\r\nQuebec. In Lisbon and the colonial towns, the agents acted also as\r\npostmasters.[545]\r\n\r\n[540] _Ibid._, no. 7, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[541] _Fin. Rep._, no. 7, p. 119.\r\n\r\n[542] _Ibid._, no. 7, p. 118.\r\n\r\n[543] _Ibid._, no. 7, pp. 122-23.\r\n\r\n[544] _Ibid._, no. 7, p. 117.\r\n\r\n[545] _Ibid._, no. 7, p. 116.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, all the packets sailing out of Falmouth were transferred to the\r\nAdmiralty, in spite of Freeling's protest. The question had been\r\ndiscussed again and again during the war with France but why it was\r\ndecided upon at this particular time is not clear. At the time of\r\ntransfer, thirty packets were employed at Falmouth, carrying mails to\r\nand from Lisbon, Brazil, Buenos Ayres, the Mediterranean, America, the\r\nLeeward Isles, Jamaica, Colombia, and Mexico. In 1828, the number of\r\npackets at Falmouth had increased to thirty-eight brigs of war and\r\nsailing vessels and in 1833 to forty-one.[546]\r\n\r\n[546] _Rep. Commrs._, 1830, xiv, app., no. 78; _Acc. & P._, 1834, xlix,\r\np. 3; Joyce, pp. 398-99.\r\n\r\nThe Admiralty had exceedingly bad luck with the Falmouth boats for the\r\nfirst seven years. During that time seven of them were lost; four were\r\nwrecked, one was supposed to have been burned, one was smashed to pieces\r\nby icebergs, and one was captured by pirates off Rio Janeiro.[547]\r\n\r\n[547] _Acc. & P._, 1834, xlix, p. 49. Three of the boats wrecked were on\r\ntheir way to or from Halifax, N. S.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, the charge of all the packets and the powers and authorities\r\nthen existing in the Postmaster-General under any contract for the\r\nconveyance of mails were transferred to the Admiralty by act of\r\nParliament.[548] The Post Office was still to retain the discretionary\r\npower of regulating the time of departure of the packets and of\r\nreceiving the reports of the agents when the mail was delayed.[549] In\r\nthe same year, but by a later act, the Postmaster-General was authorized\r\nto contract for the conveyance of letters by private ships between any\r\nplaces whatever, but such ships must be British. The rates were to be\r\nthe same as the packet rates, but the owners, charterers, and consignees\r\nof vessels inward bound were allowed to receive letters free to the\r\nweight of six ounces, or twenty ounces in the case of vessels coming\r\nfrom Ceylon, the East Indies, and the Cape of Good Hope.[550] For every\r\nletter retained by the captain or any other person there was a penalty\r\nof £10. The captain was also liable to a penalty for refusing to take\r\nthe letter bags, even when no contract had been signed.[551]\r\n\r\n[548] 7 Wm. IV and I Vict., c. 3.\r\n\r\n[549] _Acc. & P._, 1837-38, xlv, pp. 1, 2.\r\n\r\n[550] 7 Wm. IV and I Vict., c. 34.\r\n\r\n[551] 7 Wm. IV and I Vict., c. 36.\r\n\r\nThe control of the packets by the Admiralty after 1837 failed to produce\r\nthe results anticipated. The power of authorizing contracts for the\r\nconveyance of the mails by water was actually vested in the Lords of the\r\nTreasury upon consultation with the Postmaster-General, the Colonial\r\nSecretary, and the Lords of the Admiralty with reference to the postal,\r\ncolonial, or nautical questions involved, but as a matter of fact these\r\nofficials did not always work in harmony. The mails continued to be\r\ncarried by private vessels or war vessels not under contract, by packets\r\nbelonging to the Crown, and by vessels under contract. Before the use of\r\nsteam vessels the Government was able as a rule to make contracts for a\r\nshort period and at comparatively little cost. Between England and the\r\nneighbouring countries (Ireland, France, and Belgium), government steam\r\npackets were employed. For the longer voyages it was considered\r\nadvisable to induce commercial companies to build steam vessels by\r\noffering large subsidies for long periods. In 1853, a Parliamentary\r\nCommittee reported in condemnation of the further use of\r\ngovernment-owned packets on account of their expense and also of the\r\npayments to the owners of contract vessels in excess of the actual cost\r\nof mail carriage. They pointed out, however, that exceptions might very\r\nwell be made when for political or social reasons it seemed necessary to\r\ncarry mails to places where commercial vessels did not go, or went very\r\nirregularly, or where high speed was desirable.[552] This report, in so\r\nfar as it condemned the use of government-owned packets and the\r\nexcessive subsidies paid to contractors, repeated the findings of an\r\nearlier committee published in 1849, which had in addition advised that\r\nthe rule should be observed of calling for tenders in the most public\r\nway possible.[553] In 1852, the only service performed by the government\r\npackets was that between Dover, Calais, and Ostend. On the French\r\nservice the night mails between Dover and Calais were conveyed by\r\nBritish packets and the day mails by French. Between Dover and Ostend\r\nthere was a daily service, thrice a week by British, four times by\r\nBelgian packets. Of the six boats employed by the Admiralty, four were\r\nkept fully manned and two were spare steamers. The receipts did not\r\nequal the gross expenses.[554] Again in 1860, the year in which the\r\ncontrol of the packets was transferred to the Post Office, we find a\r\nthird Parliamentary committee repeating the recommendations of its\r\npredecessors so far as the subsidy question was concerned. Nothing was\r\nsaid about the government steamers, for in the meantime the principle of\r\npacket ownership had been abandoned.[555]\r\n\r\n[552] _Rep. Com._, 1860, xiv; _Acc. & P._, 1852-53, xcv, 1660, pp. 1-7.\r\n\r\n[553] _Rep. Com._, 1849, xii, p. iii.\r\n\r\n[554] _Acc. & P._, 1852-53, xcv, 1660, p. 37.\r\n\r\n[555] _Rep.

The inland\r\npacket service of the United Kingdom included, among others, the lines\r\nbetween Holyhead and Kingstown, Liverpool and the Isle of Man, Aberdeen\r\nand Lerwick, Southampton and the Channel Isles. This formed a necessary\r\npart of the inland postal service, and no attempt was made to meet\r\nexpenses by levying a sea-transit postage. In the case of the Isle of\r\nMan the postage collected covered the cost of the packets and of the\r\nland establishment of the Post Office in the island. The expenses of the\r\nShetland packets by themselves exceeded the postage collected, and the\r\nOrkney postal expenses were also greater than the revenue.\r\n\r\nThe second class consisted of the packets plying between England and the\r\ncolonies or between the colonies themselves, and included the lines to\r\nIndia, Australia, the Cape, the West Indies, and British North America.\r\nThis class was and is by far the most important. Three-fourths of the\r\nwhole annual subsidies paid by the Government for the packet service\r\nwere paid to three great companies, the Peninsular and Oriental, the\r\nRoyal Mail, and the Cunard Company. The first of these connected England\r\nwith India and the Orient, the second with the West Indian colonies, and\r\nthe third with the North American Provinces. The great cost involved in\r\nsubsidizing these companies was excused on the ground of absolute\r\nnecessity for a regular and rapid mail service between the mother\r\ncountry and her colonies. Of the lines furnishing communications with\r\nforeign countries, several were connected with and subsidiary to the\r\ncolonial service, as the continuation of the Cunard line to the United\r\nStates. The service to China was the most remunerative part of the\r\nsystem undertaken by the Peninsular and Oriental boats, and the same may\r\nbe said of the foreign service of the Royal Mail Company. From a\r\ncommercial point of view the Continental packets were perhaps the most\r\nimportant of all.[556]\r\n\r\n[556] _Acc. & P._, 1852-53, xcv, 1660, pp. 37-43.\r\n\r\nThe first contract with an individual steamship company was made in 1840\r\nwith the famous Cunard Company providing for the conveyance of mails\r\nbetween Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. In accordance with\r\nthe recommendations of various committees, attempts were made later to\r\nplace the Atlantic packet service upon a firmer financial basis so far\r\nas the loss to the Post Office was concerned. In 1868, the contract with\r\nthe Cunard Company, which had been renewed at various times under\r\nsomewhat different conditions, came to an end. The Conservative\r\nGovernment which was just going out arranged for two services a week\r\nwith the Cunard Company for £70,000, and one a week with the Inman\r\nCompany for £35,000. There was considerable opposition to the agreement\r\namong the Liberal majority of the new Parliament, but it could not of\r\ncourse be repudiated. This contract came to an end in 1876, and a\r\ncircular was addressed to the various steamship companies informing them\r\nthat the government would hereafter send the American mails by the most\r\nefficient ships, payment to be made at the rate of 2_s._ 4_d._ a pound\r\nfor letters and 2_d._ a pound for other mail matter, those being the\r\nrates fixed by the Postal Union Treaty and adopted by the American\r\nGovernment. The Inman and White Star Companies refused at first to have\r\nanything to do with the new system of payment, but eventually they fell\r\ninto line. The system was in operation for a year at a cost of £28,000\r\nin place of the old charge of £105,000. The Cunard, Inman, and White\r\nStar Companies then demanded double the previous rates on the ground\r\nthat they were conducting the service at a loss, and an agreement with\r\nthe Government was concluded for the payment of 4_s._ a pound for\r\nletters and 4_d._ for newspapers, etc. At the same time the old\r\nmonopolistic conditions were virtually reëstablished, for rival\r\nsteamship lines were excluded from the agreement.[557]\r\n\r\n[557] _Parl. Deb._, 3d ser., ccxxxviii, coll., 1633-36.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, the agreement with the Cunard, Inman, and White Star Lines came\r\nto an end. The Cunard and White Star Companies then made an offer\r\nprecluding the use of the fast boats of other lines, but this was\r\ndeclined. Eventually an agreement was reached at a reduced cost, which\r\ngave the Post Office the right to send letters so directed by any other\r\nships than those of the White Star or Cunard Companies. The amounts to\r\nbe paid were measured by the actual weight of mail matter carried.[558]\r\nThe payments to the Peninsular and Oriental Company were based at first\r\nentirely upon mileage covered, and reductions were made if the packets\r\nfell below a minimum speed agreed upon. This method was later changed to\r\na payment based upon the amount of mail carried, and the subsidy was\r\nsubstantially reduced.[559]\r\n\r\n[558] 3_s._ a lb. for letters; 1_s._ 8_d._ when carried by other lines\r\n(_Rep.

The Holyhead and Kingstown service\r\nis exceptional, not being terminable until 1917, or on twelve months'\r\nnotice after 31st March, 1916. This is by far the most important of any\r\nof the home systems and costs £100,000, to be reduced to £80,000 in\r\n1917. The contract for the conveyance of mails between Dover and Calais\r\nis terminable on twelve months' notice and cost £25,000 for the postal\r\nyear 1906-07. The payments for the use of the other boats between the\r\nUnited Kingdom and Europe are comparatively small, amounting in 1906-07\r\nto £3780 only, and all these contracts are terminable on six months'\r\nnotice. The contracts for the conveyance of the mails to the two\r\nAmericas are as a rule terminable on six or twelve months' notice, but\r\nan exception has been made in the case of the Cunard Company with whom\r\nand under peculiar circumstances a twenty years' agreement was made in\r\n1902. In 1906-07 the cost of the conveyance of the mails between the\r\nUnited Kingdom and North and South America was £198,488. The African\r\ncontracts are all terminable on three, six, or twelve months' notice,\r\nand amounted in 1906-07 to £32,988. The carriage of the mails to India,\r\nAustralasia, and China for the year ending 31st March, 1907, cost\r\n£402,162, but this has since been diminished by a reduction in the\r\nsubsidies to the Peninsular and Oriental Company and the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway Company.[560]\r\n\r\n[560] _Rep. P. G._, 1907, pp. 5-6, 52-53.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditure for packet boats increased enormously after 1840,\r\nand this increase in cost kept down the net revenue of the Post Office\r\nfor many years after the introduction of penny postage. In 1830, the\r\npacket expenses amounted only to £108,305, in 1846, to £723,604, and in\r\n1860, to £869,952. They reached the maximum point of £1,056,798 in 1869,\r\nand from that time until 1890, when they were £665,375, there has been\r\non the whole a gradual diminution. During the year ending 31st March,\r\n1892, they reached the sum of £701,081, for the postal year 1900-01 they\r\nwere £764,804, and during the year 1905-06 they had diminished to\r\n£687,109.[561]\r\n\r\n[561] _Rep.

His charges for \"packets,\" and by packets he\r\nmeant letters or parcels carried by a special messenger, were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  To the Hague £7.\r\n  To Brussels or Paris £10.\r\n  To Vienna £60.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary rates were:--\r\n\r\n  To or from any of the above places 30_s._\r\n  To or from any part of Germany 6_s._\r\n  From Venice for a single letter 9_d._[562]\r\n  From Venice for any letter over a single letter 2_s._ 8_d._\r\n  From Leghorn and Florence for a single letter 1_s._\r\n  From Leghorn and Florence over a single letter 3_s._an ounce.[563]\r\n\r\nThis system of rates, although crude, marks a distinct era in postal\r\nprogress. It forms the foundation of the plan which was perfected a few\r\nyears later by Witherings. De Quester also published a statement of the\r\ndays of departure of the regular posts with foreign letters.[564] In the\r\ntrial between Stanhope and de Quester over the question of who should be\r\nForeign Postmaster-General, it came out in the evidence that Stanhope\r\nhad been accustomed to receive 8_d._ for every letter to Hamburg,\r\nAmsterdam, and Antwerp.[565] This charge was rather in the nature of a\r\nperquisite than a legal rate and serves partly to explain why Stanhope\r\nwas so anxious to retain the monopoly of the foreign post.\r\n\r\n[562] The rate from Venice had been _16d._ By a single letter is meant\r\none piece of paper.\r\n\r\n[563] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1625-26, p. 523.\r\n\r\n[564] _Ibid._, 1628-29, p. 538.\r\n\r\n[565] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 48 (25).\r\n\r\nWitherings' rates for domestic postage, as fixed by Royal Proclamation\r\nin 1635, were as follows for a single letter:--\r\n\r\n                                _d._\r\n  Under 80 miles                  2\r\n  Between 80 and 140 miles        4\r\n  Over 140 miles                  6\r\n  On the Borders and in Scotland  8\r\n  In Ireland                      9\r\n\r\nIf there were more than one sheet of paper, postage must be paid\r\naccording to the above rate for every separate sheet or enclosure. For\r\ninstance, a letter or packet composed of two sheets was called a double\r\nletter and paid 4_d._ for any distance under 80 miles. A letter of three\r\nsheets was called a triple letter and paid 6_d._ if conveyed under 80\r\nmiles, and so in proportion.[566] In 1638, the rules concerning the\r\nimposition of rates were changed slightly. The rates themselves remained\r\nthe same for single and double letters. Letters above double letters\r\nwere to be charged according to weight as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Under 80 miles           6_d._ an ounce.\r\n  From 80 to 140 miles     9_d._\r\n  Above 140 miles         12_d._\r\n  For Ireland              6_d._ if over two ounces.[567]\r\n\r\nThis expedient must have been adopted from the difficulty in discovering\r\nthe number of enclosures when there were more than two. It is impossible\r\nto say how long these rates continued, probably not later than\r\nWitherings' régime. During Prideaux' management the maximum postage on a\r\nsingle letter was 6_d._, reduced later to 3_d._[568]\r\n\r\n[566] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 57 (36).\r\n\r\n[567] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 58 (37).\r\n\r\n[568] Joyce, p. 29.\r\n\r\nThe Council of State gave orders in 1652 for the imposition of the\r\nfollowing rates for a single letter:--\r\n\r\n                                        _d._\r\n  Within 100 miles from London           2\r\n  To remoter parts of England and Wales  3\r\n  To Scotland                            4\r\n  To Ireland                             6[569]\r\n\r\nWhether these rates were actually collected is questionable. The\r\npostage which the farmers of the Posts were allowed to collect in the\r\nfollowing year was fixed by the Council of State for single letters as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                               _d._\r\n  Under 80 miles from London    2\r\n  Above 80 miles from London    3\r\n  To Scotland                   4\r\n  To Ireland                    6\r\n\r\nThese rates are in effect lower than those of Witherings, for he had\r\ninserted a 3_d._ rate for letters delivered between 80 and 140 miles\r\nfrom London, had charged 4_d._ for all letters going farther than 140\r\nmiles, and had charged 8_d._ and 9_d._ for letters to Scotland and\r\nIreland respectively. They were a little higher than those of 1652, for\r\nby them 2_d._ had carried a letter 100 miles.[570]\r\n\r\n[569] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1651-52, p. 507.\r\n\r\n[570] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1652-53, p. 449.\r\n\r\nIn 1657, the first act of Parliament was passed, fixing rates for\r\nletters and establishing the system for England, Ireland, and Scotland.\r\nThe domestic rates were:--\r\n\r\n                                        _For a_      _Double_   _Per_\r\n                                    _single letter_  _letter_  _ounce_\r\n\r\n             {Within 80 miles from London  2_d._.       4_d._     8_d._\r\n  In England {Above 80 miles from London   3            6        12\r\n              To or from Scotland          4            8        18\r\n              To or from Ireland           6           12        24\r\n  In Ireland {Within 40 miles from Dublin  2            4         8\r\n             {Above 40 miles from Dublin   4            8        12\r\n\r\nThe foreign rates were:--\r\n\r\n                                         _For a_      _Double_   _Per_\r\n                                     _single letter_  _letter_  _ounce_\r\n   To Leghorn, Genoa, Florence, Lyons,\r\n   Marseilles, Aleppo, Constantinople      12_d._      24_d._    45_d._\r\n   To St. Malo, Morlaix, Nieuhaven          6          12        18\r\n   To Bordeaux, Rochelle, Nantes,\r\n     Bayonne, Cadiz, Madrid                 9          18        24\r\n   To Hamburg, Frankfort, and Cologne       8          16        24\r\n   To Dantzic, Leipsic, Lubeck,\r\n     Stockholm, Copenhagen, Elsinore,\r\n     Konigsburg                            12          24        48[571]\r\n\r\n[571] Scobell, _Collect._, pt. ii, pp. 511-13. Inland letters containing\r\nmore than two enclosures but weighing less than an ounce were charged\r\naccording to the number of enclosures.\r\n\r\nThese rates are considerably lower than those of Witherings and are\r\nessentially the same as those of 1653, except that the postage is fixed\r\nfor letters to and from the continent. No provision is made for letters\r\nto and from any other part of the world but Europe. Since the government\r\nhad not established any postal communication with Asia, Africa, or the\r\nAmericas, it would have been unfair to demand postage on letters\r\nconveyed by merchant vessels to and from those places.[572]\r\n\r\n[572] Scobell, _Collect._, pt. ii, pp. 511-13.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1660 is generally referred to as bringing the Post Office\r\nunder Parliamentary control and as the basis of the modern system. This\r\nis probably due to the fact that the act of 1657 was passed by a\r\nCommonwealth Parliament and signed by Cromwell. Whether its authors\r\nlacked the power to give it validity, they did not lack the brains to\r\npass an excellent act, and although the Royalists saw fit, after the\r\nRestoration, to dub it the pretended act of 1657, they could not improve\r\nit and had the sense to leave it largely untouched. The first act had\r\nimposed rates from or to any place to or from London as a centre. It had\r\nbeen taken for granted that all letters passed to, from, or through the\r\ncapital, and to all intents and purposes this was so. It was possible,\r\nhowever, for letters, technically called bye-letters, to stop short of\r\nLondon, and it was to provide for these that postage was to be reckoned\r\nfrom any place where a letter might be posted.\r\n\r\nScotland was no longer a part of England after the Restoration, so that\r\nby the act of 1660 rates were given to and from Berwick and for single\r\nletters were a penny less than they had been to Scotland under the\r\nearlier act. From Berwick the rate, within a radius of forty miles, was\r\n2_d._ for a single letter, and over forty miles, 4_d._ As far as foreign\r\npostage was concerned, letters to the northern coast towns of Italy paid\r\n3_d._ less than the old rate for a single letter. Other rates remained\r\nthe same. Alternative routes were sometimes offered. For instance,\r\nletters might be sent directly to northern Italy or they might go via\r\nLyons, but in the latter case they cost 3_d._ more. Again, there were\r\nmany more continental towns to which letters might be sent and from\r\nwhich they might be received. Letters for Germany via Hamburg had to be\r\npostpaid as far as that city. The same was true of letters to southern\r\nFrance via Paris and of letters to northern Italy via Lyons. The highest\r\nrate paid for a single letter was 1_s._ to northern Italy, Turkey, and\r\ncentral and northern Germany. Merchants' accounts not exceeding one\r\nsheet of paper, bills of exchange, invoices and bills of lading, were to\r\npay nothing over the charge of the letter in which they might be\r\nenclosed. The same rule was to hold for the covers of letters sent to\r\nTurkey via Marseilles. All inland letters were to be paid for at the\r\nplace where they were delivered unless the sender wished to pay in\r\nadvance.[573]\r\n\r\n[573] 12 Chas. II, c. 35.\r\n\r\nWhen the Scotch was separated from the English Post Office in 1695,\r\nrates were imposed by the Parliament of Scotland as follows:\r\n\r\n                              _For a single letter_\r\n  To Berwick                           2_s._[574]\r\n  Within 50 miles from Edinburgh       2\r\n  From 50 to 100 miles from Edinburgh  3\r\n  Above 100 miles from Edinburgh       4\r\n\r\nPackages of papers were to pass as triple letters.[575] In 1701, when\r\nthe Scotch Post was let out to farm, the English Postmasters-General\r\nadvised that the farmers should be obliged to pay at Berwick the postage\r\non English and foreign letters for Scotland, and an order in accordance\r\nwith this advice was signed by the King. It was the custom to change the\r\nfarmers every three years, which may have produced a larger revenue but\r\nwas certainly not calculated to increase the efficiency of the office.\r\nThe English Postmasters-General had great difficulty in collecting at\r\nBerwick the postage due them, and it is doubtful whether a large part\r\nwas ever paid. The frequent changes in the farmers must have been an\r\nexcellent means of allowing them to escape their debts to the\r\nEnglish.[576]\r\n\r\n[574] One shilling Scotch was equal to one penny English.\r\n\r\n[575] Wm. III, 1st parl., 5th session (Scotland), c. 31.\r\n\r\n[576] _Cal. T. P._, 1697-1702, 48; 1702-1707, 101.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to point to the postage rates of 1660 as lower\r\nthan any before the nineteenth century. This is true in a general way,\r\nbut one limitation to the statement is generally overlooked. Before 1696\r\nall posts ran to or from London, and it was not until well on in the\r\neighteenth century that the system of cross posts was introduced.\r\nBristol and Exeter are less than eighty miles apart, but a letter from\r\nBristol to Exeter went to London first and from there to Exeter,\r\ntravelling about 300 miles to reach a town eighty miles distant. Now by\r\nthe act of 1660, the rate for distances above 80 miles was 3_d._ Thus\r\nthe letter paid 3_d._ from Bristol to London and 3_d._ more from London\r\nto Exeter, 6_d._ in all. If there had been a direct post from Bristol to\r\nExeter, and there was not until 1698, the postage would have been 2_d._\r\nonly. The possibility of such an anomaly as this must be kept in mind in\r\nconsidering the low rates of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIn James the Second's reign, a Post Office had been established in\r\nJamaica, and rates of postage had been settled not only in the island\r\nitself but between it and the mother country. This was a new departure,\r\nsince at that time there were no packet boats to the West Indies. The\r\nrate between England and Jamaica was 6_d._ for a single letter, 1_s._\r\nfor a double letter, and 2_s._ an ounce. As the Crown was not at the\r\nexpense of maintaining means of transport, this was a pure tax.[577] In\r\n1704, the postage on a single letter from the West Indies was raised to\r\n7-1/2_d._, for a double letter 15_d._, but Dummer's packets were then in\r\noperation.[578]\r\n\r\n[577] Joyce, p. 78.\r\n\r\n[578] _Cal.

All that is known about\r\nthe rates is that the charge for the conveyance of a letter between\r\nBoston and New York was 1_s._ and the post went weekly between those\r\nplaces.[579] Hamilton, the deputy manager, proposed that letters from\r\nEngland should be sent in sealed bags entrusted to the masters of ships.\r\nThe bags were to be handed over to the postmaster of the port where the\r\nship first touched and the captain was to receive a penny for each\r\nletter. He advised that the following rates should be adopted:--\r\n\r\nNot exceeding 80 miles from New York            6_d._\r\nFrom 80 to 150 miles from New York              9\r\nTo and from Boston and New York, 300 miles     12\r\n                       Jersey, 370 miles       18\r\n                       Philadelphia, 390 miles 20\r\n                       Annapolis, 550 miles    36\r\n                       Jamestown, 680 miles    42\r\n          New York and Annapolis, 250 miles    24\r\n                       Jamestown, 380 miles\r\n(with many dangerous places to cross by ferry) 30\r\n\r\nThese rates were said to be too high and were not adopted, \"it being\r\nfound that cheap postage greatly encourages letter writing, as is shown\r\nby the reduction in England from 6_d._ to 3_d._\"[580]\r\n\r\n[579] Joyce, p. 111.\r\n\r\n[580] Joyce, p. 113; _Cal. T. P._, 1697-1702, 77.\r\n\r\nThe preamble to the act of 1711 offered as an explanation of an increase\r\nin rates the necessity for money for the war and the prevention of\r\nprivate competition in carrying letters. It is plain that higher rates\r\nwill, up to a certain point, increase proceeds, though not\r\nproportionately, but how increased rates can decrease competition is\r\nmore difficult to explain. Witherings had found that the cheaper he made\r\npostage, the less fear was there from interlopers. It is possible that\r\nthe framers of the bill had intended to use part of the increase in\r\nrevenue for the support of searchers, but no such provision is contained\r\nin the act itself.[581] On the ground that a large revenue was\r\nnecessary, no fault can be found with the increase. It is probably true\r\nthat in course of time lower rates would have increased the product more\r\nthan higher, but war and its demands wait for no man. The people who\r\ncould write and who needed to write were in a small minority then, and\r\ntheir number could not for a long time be influenced by lower rates.\r\nWhat was needed at once was money and the only way to raise it by means\r\nof the Post Office was the one adopted.\r\n\r\n[581] Joyce, p. 128.\r\n\r\nThe rates for single letters within England and between England and\r\nEdinburgh were increased by a penny for a single letter; for double\r\nletters and parcels in proportion. To Dublin the charge remained the\r\nsame, and the rates within Ireland were not changed. In the act of 1660,\r\nthe postage on letters delivered in Scotland had been reckoned from\r\nBerwick. Edinburgh was now made the centre and the rates were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                              _For a single letter_  _Per ounce_\r\nFrom Edinburgh within Scotland        _d._               _d._\r\n  Not exceeding 50 miles               2                  8\r\n  Above 50 and not exceeding 80 miles  3                 12\r\n  Above 80 miles                       4                 16[582]\r\n\r\n[582] Double letters were charged twice as much as single letters.\r\n\r\nThe rates within Scotland were lower than those within England and\r\nIreland. Scotland had a 2_d._ rate for distances not exceeding fifty\r\nmiles. England had no rate under 3_d._, except for the Penny Post.\r\nIreland, too, had a 2_d._ rate for distances not exceeding forty miles,\r\nbut for distances from forty to eighty miles and over, the rate for\r\nIrish letters was 4_d._, while in England the rate was only 3_d._ for\r\ndistances not exceeding eighty miles. The distances which letters\r\ntravelled within Scotland were shorter than in England and Ireland. As a\r\nrule the different rates for the three countries varied with their\r\nwealth and consequent ability to pay, the least being required from\r\npoverty-stricken Scotland. The new rates as compared with the old were\r\nfor a single letter:[583]--\r\n\r\n                    _For England_\r\n                                          1660      1711\r\n  Not exceeding 80 miles                   2_d._     3_d._\r\n  Above 80 miles                           3         4\r\n  Between London and Edinburgh             5         6\r\n  Between London and Dublin                6         6\r\n\r\n                  _Within Ireland_\r\n\r\n  Not exceeding 40 miles from Dublin       2_d._     2_d._\r\n  Above 40 miles from Dublin               4         4\r\n\r\n       _Within Scotland (Scotch Act, 1695)_\r\n\r\n  Not exceeding 50 miles from Edinburgh    2_d._     2_d._\r\n  From 50 to 80 miles from Edinburgh                 3\r\n  From 50 to 100 miles from Edinburgh      3\r\n  Above 80 miles from Edinburgh                      4\r\n  Above 100 miles from Edinburgh           4\r\n\r\n[583] When the rates for single letters only are given it is understood\r\nthat double and triple letters paid two and three times as much\r\nrespectively. Letters weighing an ounce or more paid a single letter\r\nrate for each quarter of an ounce.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1660 imposed rates on letters in Scotland from Berwick as a\r\ncentre. By that act rates had been fixed for distances not exceeding 40\r\nmiles and for distances over forty miles from Berwick, being 2_d._ and\r\n4_d._ for single letters for the respective distances, so that by the\r\nact of 1711, the Scotch rates were lower than they had been in 1660 and\r\nslightly higher than those of 1695. When forty miles was made the lowest\r\ndistance according to which rates were levied, it was thought and\r\nintended that 2_d._, the rate for that distance, would pay for a single\r\nletter from Berwick to Edinburgh. As a matter of fact, the distance\r\nbetween the two places was fifty miles, so that the Scotch Act had\r\nestimated it better.\r\n\r\nIn the rates as given above, an exception is made in the case of letters\r\ndirected on board ship or brought by it. For such letters one penny was\r\ncharged in addition to the rates already given. This extra penny was\r\ncharged because the postmaster in the place where the ship first touched\r\nwas required to pay the master of the vessel one penny for every letter\r\nreceived. Foreign letters collected or delivered at any place between\r\nLondon and the port of departure or arrival of the ship for which they\r\nwere destined or by which they had come, must pay the same rate as if\r\nthey had left or arrived in London.\r\n\r\nAs far as foreign post rates were concerned they were all from 1_d._ to\r\n3_d._ higher than they had been by the act of 1660. The lowest foreign\r\nrate for a single letter, 10_d._, was paid between London and France,\r\nand London and the Spanish Netherlands. To Germany and Northwestern\r\nEurope, through the Spanish Netherlands, the rate was 12_d._, to Italy\r\nor Sicily the same way 12_d._, postpaid to Antwerp, or 15_d._ via Lyons.\r\nThe same rates held for letters passing through the United Provinces. To\r\nSpain or Portugal via the Spanish Netherlands or the United Provinces or\r\nFrance, postpaid to Bayonne, the rate was 18_d._ for a single letter,\r\nand the same price held when letters were conveyed directly by sailing\r\npackets.\r\n\r\nBy the same act of 1711 rates were for the first time established\r\nbetween England and her colonies and within the colonies themselves. The\r\npostage for a single letter from London to any of the West India Islands\r\nwas 18_d._, to New York 12_d._, and the same from those places to\r\nLondon. Between the West Indies and New York the rate was 4_d._ In the\r\ncolonies on the mainland, the chief letter offices were at New York,\r\nPerth Amboy, New London, Philadelphia, Bridlington, Newport, Portsmouth,\r\nBoston, Annapolis, Salem, Ipswich, Piscataway, Williamstown, and\r\nCharleston. The postage was 4_d._ to and from any of these places to a\r\ndistance not exceeding sixty miles and 6_d._ for any distance between\r\nsixty and 100 miles. Between New York, Perth Amboy, and Bridlington, the\r\nrate was 6_d._; between New York, New London, and Philadelphia 9_d._;\r\nbetween New York, Newport, Portsmouth, and Boston 12_d._; between New\r\nYork, Salem, Ipswich, Piscataway, and Williamstown 15_d._; between New\r\nYork and Charleston 18_d._; the Post Office was to pay nothing for\r\ncrossing ferries.\r\n\r\nThere had always been trouble in collecting the rates on bye and cross\r\npost letters. These letters did not pass through London and hence the\r\nofficials at the General Post Office had no check on the money due. By a\r\nclause in the act, the postmasters were ordered under a penalty to\r\naccount for the receipts from all these letters. The postage on letters\r\nwhich did not pass to, through, or from London was fixed according to\r\nthe inland charges, varying with the distances travelled. Finally, the\r\npostage on all inland letters was to be paid on delivery unless the\r\nsender wished to pay in advance, or in the case of the Penny Post, or\r\nunless such letters should be directed on board any ship or vessel or to\r\nany person in the army.\r\n\r\nFrom the receipts from postage, £700 a week was to be paid into the\r\nExchequer for the purpose of carrying on the war. The Accountant-General\r\nwas to keep account of all money raised, the receipts themselves going\r\ndirectly to the Receiver-General and being paid into the Exchequer by\r\nhim. One third of the surplus over and above the weekly payment of £700\r\nand £111,461 (the amount of the gross receipts of the duties arising by\r\nvirtue of the act of 1660) were to be disposed of by Parliament. In\r\nmaking this provision, Joyce thinks that the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nconfused gross and net product.[584] As a matter of fact there was no\r\nsuch surplus as was anticipated by the Chancellor, but it does not\r\nfollow that he made the mistake of which he was accused by Cornwallis\r\nand Craggs, an accusation in which Joyce evidently concurs. He erred\r\nsimply in supposing that expenses would remain the same.[585]\r\n\r\n[584] Joyce, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[585] 9 Anne, c. 11.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1711 in prescribing the rate of postage for the carriage of\r\n\"every single letter or piece of paper\" enacted that a \"double letter\r\nshould pay twice that rate.\" The merchants contended that a double\r\nletter was composed of two sheets of paper if they weighed less than an\r\nounce and their reasoning was logical. They argued from this that a\r\nletter enclosing a pattern or patterns, if it weighed less than one\r\nounce, should pay only as a single letter. Actions were brought against\r\nthe postmasters by the merchants for charging more than they considered\r\nwas warranted and the merchants won every case. The lawyers also\r\nthreatened legal proceedings for the charge of writs when enclosed in\r\nletters. The Postmasters-General hastened to Parliament for relief. The\r\nmerchants heard of this, and petitions were sent to the House of Commons\r\nfrom \"clothiers, dealers in cloth, silk, and other manufactured goods,\"\r\nasking that when samples were enclosed in a single letter the rate\r\nshould remain the same provided that such letter and sample did not\r\nexceed half an ounce in weight.[586] Their efforts were fruitless. The\r\nfollowing provisions were inserted in a tobacco bill then before\r\nParliament and passed in 1753: \"that every writ etc. enclosed in a\r\nletter was to pay as a distinct letter and that a letter with one or\r\nmore patterns enclosed and not exceeding one ounce in weight was to pay\r\nas a double letter.\"[587] As a matter of fact all the rates collected\r\nafter 1743 by virtue of the act of 1711 were illegal, for the act itself\r\nhad died a natural death in the former year by that clause which\r\nprovided for the revival of the rates of 1660 at the end of thirty-two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[586] _Jo. H. C._, 1745-50, pp. 751-2.\r\n\r\n[587] 26 Geo. III, c. 13, secs. 7, 8.\r\n\r\nA postal act was passed in 1765, slightly changing the home, colonial,\r\nand foreign rates. The cession of territory in North America had made\r\nnecessary a more comprehensive scheme of postage rates there. The\r\nconclusion of the Seven Years' War had made it possible to offer a\r\nslight reduction in postage. In Great Britain the following rates were\r\npublished for short distances for a single letter:--\r\n\r\nFor Great Britain--not exceeding one post stage           1_d._\r\nFor England alone--over one and not exceeding two stages  2_d._\r\n\r\nThe rates for all other distances remained unchanged. A stage, as a\r\nrule, varied from ten to twelve miles in length, so that every post town\r\nin England could now boast a modified form of penny postage, with the\r\nexception in most cases of delivery facilities.\r\n\r\nThe changes in colonial rates were generally in the shape of\r\nsubstituting general for special rules. The rate from any part of the\r\nBritish American Dominions to any other part was fixed at 4_d._ for a\r\nsingle letter when conveyed by sea. The act of 1711 had given the\r\npostage from and to specially named places. This method had become\r\ninapplicable with the growth in population among the old and the\r\nincrease in new possessions. The rate for a single letter from any chief\r\npost office in the British American Dominions to a distance not\r\nexceeding sixty miles, or for any distance not exceeding sixty miles\r\nfrom any post office from which letters did not pass through a chief\r\npost office, was placed at 4_d._, from sixty to 100 miles 6_d._, from\r\n100 to 200 miles 8_d._, for each additional hundred miles 2_d._ The\r\neffect of this act was to continue the same rates for inland postage in\r\nBritish America, while rates were provided for distances over 100 miles.\r\nThe postage between England and the American colonies remained at 12_d._\r\nfor a single letter. In the case of the West Indies, there was a\r\ndecrease of 6_d._ A clause of the act provided that the postage on\r\nletters sent out of England might be demanded in advance.[588]\r\n\r\n[588] 5 Geo. III, c. 25. The principle of payment in advance was not\r\npopular. A man in England writing to his brother in Virginia in 1764\r\nsays, \"Very often of late I have been so foolish, I should say\r\nunfortunate previously to pay for the letters coming to you.... To my\r\ngreat concern I have been since assured that such letters never go\r\nforward but are immediately thrown aside and neglected. I believe I\r\nwrote to you three or four times this last winter by this method and am\r\nsince informed of this their fate. You may form a great guess of the\r\ntruth of it by or by not receiving them\" (_Notes and Queries_, 4th ser.,\r\nxii, p. 125).\r\n\r\nPostage rates were increased steadily from 1784 for twenty-eight years,\r\nculminating in the year 1812 with the highest rates that England has\r\never seen. Every available means to raise the revenue necessary to\r\nmaintain her supremacy was resorted to, and the Post Office was\r\ncompelled to bear its share of the burden. In 1784 another penny was\r\nadded to the rates for single letters and additional rates for double\r\nand triple letters in proportion.[589] Three years later an act was\r\npassed, fixing the postage for the conveyance of a single letter by\r\nsailing packet from Milford Haven to Waterford at 6_d._ over and above\r\nall other rates. It was provided by the same act that the rates between\r\nLondon and Ireland via Milford should not exceed the rates via\r\nHolyhead.[590]\r\n\r\n[589] 24 Geo. III, sess. 2, c. 37.\r\n\r\n[590] 27 Geo. III, c. 9. In 1767 a rate of 2_d._ for a single letter was\r\nestablished between Whitehaven (Cumberland) and the Port of Douglas\r\n(Isle of Man) (7 Geo. III, c. 50).\r\n\r\nIn 1796 the rates for letters conveyed within England and Wales,\r\nBerwick, to and from Portugal, and to and from the British possessions\r\nin America, as established by the acts of 1711, 1765, and 1784, were\r\nrepealed and the following substituted for a single letter:--\r\n\r\n        _Within England, Wales and Berwick._\r\n                                                           _d._\r\n  Not exceeding 15 miles from place where letter is posted  3\r\n  From 15 to 30 miles, etc.                                 4\r\n       30    60                                             5\r\n       60    100                                            6\r\n       100   150                                            7\r\n  Over 150 miles, etc.                                      8\r\n\r\n         _Within Scotland._\r\n\r\n  In addition to rates in force                             1\r\n\r\nThe old system of reckoning by stages was thus abolished, probably on\r\naccount of the uncertainty as to the length of any particular stage and\r\nthe variations and changes which were being constantly made. This change\r\nwas made for England and Wales only, and the old system of reckoning by\r\nstages was still retained in Scotland. Letters from and to the colonies\r\nhad formerly paid no postage over the regular shilling rate for a single\r\nletter and proportionately for other letters. Now they were to pay the\r\nfull inland rate in addition. A single letter from the West Indies would\r\nnow pay the shilling packet rate plus the rate from Falmouth to London,\r\n1_s._ 8_d._ in all. The same rates and the same rule held for letters to\r\nand from Portugal. A single letter from Lisbon had formerly paid 1_s._\r\n6_d._ on delivery in London. It would now pay 1_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nThis act was not to affect letters to and from non-commissioned\r\nofficers, privates, and seamen while in active service, who were allowed\r\nto send and receive letters for one penny each, payable in advance. The\r\nrevenue arising from the new and the unrepealed rates was to be paid to\r\nthe Receiver-General and be by him carried to the Consolidated Fund. The\r\nincrease from the additional postage was estimated at £40,000 a year and\r\nwas to be used to pay the interest on loans contracted the preceding\r\nyear.[591]\r\n\r\n[591] 37 Geo. III, c. 18.\r\n\r\nWhen sailing packets were established between Weymouth and the islands\r\nof Jersey and Guernsey, the packet rates and the rates between the\r\nislands themselves were fixed at 2_d._ for a single letter. Permission\r\nwas also given to establish postal routes in the islands, and to charge\r\nthe same postage for the conveyance of letters as in England. The\r\nsurplus was to go to the General Office and all postal laws then in\r\nforce in England were to be deemed applicable to the two islands.[592]\r\n\r\n[592] 33 Geo. III, c. 60.\r\n\r\nBy the same act which gave the Postmasters-General authority to forward\r\nletters by vessels other than the regular sailing packets, rates were\r\nfixed for the carriage of such letters. For every single letter brought\r\ninto the kingdom by these vessels, 4_d._ was to be charged. The\r\nPostmasters-General might order such rates to be payable in advance or\r\non delivery. This was in addition to the inland postage, and for every\r\nletter handed over to the Post Office, the captain was to receive 2_d._\r\nThe revenue arising from this act was payable to the Exchequer.[593]\r\n\r\n[593] 39 Geo. III, c. 76.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 the Post Office was called upon again to make a further\r\ncontribution to the Exchequer to help meet the interest on new loans.\r\nThe following were the new rates for a single letter:--\r\n\r\n     _Within Great Britain by the General Post_\r\n                                                   _d._\r\n  Not exceeding 15 measured miles                   3\r\n  Above 15 but not exceeding 30 measured miles      4\r\n        30                   50                     5\r\n        50                   80                     6\r\n        80                  120                     7\r\n       120                  170                     8\r\n       170                  230                     9\r\n       230                  300                    10\r\n                                                                 _d._\r\n  For every 100 miles above 300 miles an additional rate of       1\r\n  Where the distance above 300 miles did not amount to 100 miles\r\n  an additional rate of                                           1\r\n  Where the distance above 300 miles exceeded 100 miles and for\r\n  every excess of distance over 100 miles an additional rate of   1\r\n\r\nBy the act of 1796 a uniform rate of 8_d._ for a single letter had been\r\npaid for distances over 150 miles. The new act not only imposed extra\r\nrates for all distances over 150 miles but it decreased the distances\r\nabove 30 miles for which the old postage would have paid. For instance,\r\na 6_d._ rate had carried a single letter 100 miles, a 7_d._ rate 150\r\nmiles. They now carried only 80 and 120 miles respectively.\r\n\r\nOn letters to and from places abroad, \"not being within His Majesty's\r\nDominions,\" an additional rate of 4_d._ for a single letter was\r\nimposed.[594] In London, where a penny had been charged for the\r\nconveyance of letters by the Penny Post, 2_d._ was now charged. An\r\nadditional rate of 2_d._ for a single letter was imposed upon letters\r\npassing between Great Britain and Ireland via Holyhead or Milford. The\r\nPostmasters-General were given authority to convey letters to and from\r\nplaces which were not post towns for such sums for extra service as\r\nmight be agreed upon. Merchants' accounts and bills of exchange which,\r\nwhen sent out of the kingdom or conveyed into it, had not formerly been\r\ncharged postage over the letters in which they were enclosed, were now\r\nto be rated as letters.[595]\r\n\r\n[594] When the temporary peace of Amiens was concluded in 1802, the\r\nrates for single letters from London to France were reduced to 10d.,\r\nfrom London to the Batavian Republic to 12_d._ (42 Geo. II, c. 101).\r\n\r\n[595] 41 Geo. III, c. 7.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, the following rates were imposed within Ireland for a single\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n                                 _d. (Irish)_[596]\r\n    Not exceeding 15 Irish miles  2\r\n    From 15 to 30 Irish miles     3\r\n         30    50                 4\r\n         50    80                 5\r\n    Exceeding 80 Irish miles      6\r\n\r\nThe postage on letters arriving in Ireland for the distance travelled\r\noutside Ireland was ordered to be collected by the Irish\r\nPostmaster-General and forwarded to London. An additional penny was\r\nimposed upon Dublin Penny Post letters crossing the circular road\r\naround Dublin.[597]\r\n\r\n[596] The Irish penny was of the same value as the English penny.\r\n\r\n[597] 43 Geo. III, c. 28.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, for the third time within ten years, the Exchequer fell back\r\nupon the Post Office for an increase of revenue estimated at\r\n£230,000.[598] There were added to the rates as already\r\nprescribed--1_d._ for a single letter, 2_d._ for a double letter, 3_d._\r\nfor a triple letter, and 4_d._ for a letter weighing as much as one\r\nounce, for all letters conveyed by the Post in Great Britain or between\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland. The postage on a single letter from London to\r\nBrighton was thus raised from 6_d._ to 7_d._, from London to Liverpool\r\nfrom 9_d._ to 10_d._, and from London to Edinburgh from 12_d._ to 13_d._\r\nTwopenny Post letters paid 3_d._ if sent beyond the General Post\r\nDelivery limits, while newspapers paid 1_d._ On every letter passing\r\nbetween Great Britain and a foreign country 2_d._ more was to be paid.\r\nAn additional penny was charged for every single letter between Great\r\nBritain and the British American Dominions via Portugal, and between\r\nGreat Britain, the Isle of Man and Jersey and Guernsey.[599] In the same\r\nyear the Irish rates were also increased by the imposition of an\r\nadditional penny upon each single letter with corresponding changes in\r\nthe postage on double and triple letters. The Dublin Penny Post was left\r\nuntouched, its boundaries being defined as contained within a circle of\r\nfour miles radius, with the General Post Office building as the centre.\r\nEvery letter from any ship within Irish waters was charged a penny in\r\naddition to the increased rates.[600]\r\n\r\n[598] _Parl.

An additional penny was added for the conveyance of a single\r\nletter more than twenty miles beyond the place where the letter was\r\nposted within Great Britain and between Great Britain and Ireland. For\r\nthe conveyance of a single letter between Great Britain and any of the\r\ncolonies or to any foreign country an additional 2_d._ was required.\r\nThese additional rates did not apply to letters to and from Jersey or\r\nGuernsey, or to and from any non-commissioned officer, soldier, or\r\nsailor.[601] Samples weighing no more than one ounce were to pay 2_d._\r\nif enclosed in a letter, if not enclosed, 1_d._ As this is the highest\r\npoint to which postage rates in England have ever attained, it may be\r\ninteresting to give the rates resulting from this act in tabular form as\r\nfar as the postage for inland single letters was concerned.[602]\r\n\r\n                                        _d._\r\n    Not exceeding 15 miles               4\r\n    Above 15 but not exceeding 20 miles  5\r\n          20                   30        6\r\n          30                   50        7\r\n          50                   80        8\r\n          80                  120        9\r\n         120                  170       10\r\n         170                  230       11\r\n         230                  300       12\r\n         300                  400       13\r\n         400                  500       14\r\n         500                  600       15\r\n         600                  700       16\r\n         700 miles                      17\r\n\r\n[601] Single letters written by or to non-commissioned officers,\r\nprivates, and seamen must be on their own business, and if sent by them\r\nmust bear their own signatures and the signature of their superior\r\nofficer with the name of their regiment or ship (46 Geo. III, c. 92).\r\n\r\n[602] 52 Geo. III, c. 88.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, the rate for a single letter between Falmouth and Gibraltar was\r\nfixed at 21_d._, between Falmouth and Malta 25_d._, between Gibraltar\r\nand Malta 6_d._ (46 Geo. III, c. 73).\r\n\r\nIn 1808, the rate for a single letter between Falmouth and Madeira was\r\nfixed at 18_d._, between Falmouth and Brazil 29_d._ (48 Geo. III, c.\r\n116).\r\n\r\nIn 1810, an additional penny (Irish) was added to the rates then in\r\nforce in Ireland, with the exception of the penny rate on the Dublin\r\nPenny Post Letters.[603] Three years later the rates and distances for\r\nIreland were changed again. As compared with the old rates they were as\r\nfollows, both tables being in Irish miles and Irish currency and for\r\nsingle letters only:--\r\n\r\n\r\n[603] 50 Geo.

On the whole there was little\r\nchange, but the later rates were probably more easily borne as they were\r\nlower for short distances.[604] The next year the rates and distances\r\nfor Ireland were changed again, the result being an increase both for\r\nshort and for long distances. The results are shown in the following\r\ntable in Irish miles and Irish currency and for a single letter:[605]--\r\n\r\n    Not exceeding 7 miles               2_d._\r\n    Over 7 and not exceeding 15 miles   3\r\n        15                   25         4\r\n        25                   35         5\r\n        35                   45         6\r\n        45                   55         7\r\n        55                   65         8\r\n        65                   95         9\r\n        95                  125        10\r\n       125                  150        11\r\n       150                  200        12\r\n       200                  250        13\r\n       250                  300        14\r\n    For every 100 miles over 300 miles  1\r\n\r\n[604] 53 Geo. III, c. 58.\r\n\r\n[605] 54 Geo. III, c. 119.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 an additional half-penny was demanded on all Scotch letters\r\n\"because the mail coaches now paid toll in that country.\" So at least a\r\ncorrespondent to the _Times_ says (London _Times_, 1813, June 21, p. 3).\r\n\r\nIn 1814 the postage on a single letter brought into the kingdom by\r\nships other than the regular packets was raised from 4_d._ to 6_d._ in\r\naddition to the regular inland rates. The rate for letters sent out of\r\nthe kingdom by these vessels was fixed at one third the regular packet\r\nrates.[606] An exception was made in the case of letters carried by war\r\nvessels or by vessels of the East India Company to and from the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, Mauritius, and that part of the East Indies embraced in the\r\ncharter of the company. The rates by these vessels were to be the same\r\nas the regular packet rates, 42_d._ for a single letter between those\r\nplaces and England, and 21_d._ for a single letter between the places\r\nthemselves. Newspapers were charged 3_d._ an ounce between England, the\r\nCape, Mauritius, and the East Indies. The rate for a single letter\r\nconveyed in private vessels not employed by the Post Office to carry\r\nmails was 14_d._ from England to the Cape or the East Indies, and 8_d._\r\nfrom the Cape or the East Indies to England. The company was allowed to\r\ncollect rates on letters within its own territory in India, but the\r\nPostmasters-General of England might at any time establish post offices\r\nin any such territory. The company was to be paid for the use of its\r\nships in conveying letters.[607]\r\n\r\n[606] 54 Geo. III, c. 169. Enacted for Ireland the following year (55\r\nGeo. III, c. 103).\r\n\r\n[607] 55 Geo. III, c. 153. This act, although repealed for Great Britain\r\nby 59 Geo. III, c. 111, still remained in force in Ireland (5 and 6 Wm.\r\nIV, c. 25).\r\n\r\nBy the Ship Letter Act of 1814, no letters were to be sent by private\r\nships except such as had been brought to the Post Office to be charged.\r\nThe directors of the East India Company had protested against this\r\nsection of the act. It is true that they were allowed to send and\r\nreceive letters by the ships of their own company, but in India there\r\nwas a small army of officials in their service whose letters had\r\nhitherto gone free. For that matter it had been the custom for the\r\ncompany to carry for nothing all letters and papers which were placed in\r\nthe letter box at the East India House.[608] Petitions were presented\r\nagainst an attempt on the part of the Post Office to charge postage on\r\nletters to and from India when conveyed by private vessels.[609] The\r\ncompany refused to allow its vessels to be used as packet boats or even\r\nto carry letters at all. It was in consequence of all this opposition\r\nthat the act of 1815 was passed, giving more favourable treatment to\r\nletters to and from India. By this act no person sending a letter to\r\nIndia was compelled to have it charged at the Post Office and the\r\nmasters were compelled to carry letters if the Postmasters-General\r\nordered them. The company now withdrew all opposition and even refused\r\nto accept any payment for the use of their vessels in conveying\r\nletters.[610] Notwithstanding the favourable exception made in the case\r\nof letters to and from the East Indies, there was still discontent over\r\nthe high rates charged by the Post Office for the conveyance of letters\r\nby the regular packet boats and by private vessels, when carrying\r\nletters entrusted to the Post Office.[611] In 1819 the sea postage on\r\nany letter or package not exceeding three ounces in weight from Ceylon,\r\nMauritius, the Cape, and the East Indies was placed at 4_d._ If it\r\nexceeded three ounces in weight, it was charged 12_d._ an ounce. The sea\r\npostage on letters and packages to Ceylon, etc., not exceeding three\r\nounces in weight, was placed at 2_d._ If the weight was more than three\r\nounces, the charge was 12_d._ an ounce. The postage on letters and\r\npackages from England was payable in advance. Newspapers were charged a\r\npenny an ounce.[612]\r\n\r\n[608] London _Times_, 1814, Oct. 8, p. 3; 1815, Jan. 19, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[609] _Parl. Deb._, 1st ser., xxx, col. 766; xxxi, col. 220.\r\n\r\n[610] Joyce, p. 363.\r\n\r\n[611] The _Calcutta Monthly_ complained that the new rates had rendered\r\ncorrespondence less frequent. \"The so-called packet boats are often two\r\nor three months slower than private vessels\" (London _Times_, 1818, Oct.\r\n30, p. 3).\r\n\r\n[612] 59 Geo. III, c. 111; London _Times_, 1820, Jan. 24, p. 3.\r\n\r\nBy an act passed in 1827 it was provided that henceforth all rates for\r\nletters conveyed within Ireland should be collected in British currency.\r\nThe rates themselves and the distances remained the same as had been\r\nprovided by the act of 1814. The postage collected on letters between\r\nthe two kingdoms was henceforth to be retained in the country where it\r\nwas collected. The rates for letters passing between the two kingdoms\r\nwere assimilated with the rates prescribed for Great Britain by the act\r\nof 1812. In addition to the land rates, 2d. was required for the sea\r\npassage to and from Holyhead and Milford and to this 2_d._ more was\r\nadded for the use of the Conway and Menai Bridges.[613] Between\r\nPortpatrick and Donaghadee the postage was 4_d._ for a single letter,\r\nbetween Liverpool and any Irish port 8_d._, but no letter sent via\r\nLiverpool paid a higher rate than if sent via Holyhead.[614] An\r\nadditional halfpenny was also demanded on every single letter passing\r\nbetween Milford Haven and Waterford, to pay for improvements.[615]\r\n\r\n[613] 7 and 8 Geo. IV, c. 21. The postage between Liverpool and Dublin\r\nfor a single letter was 13_d._, made up as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Inland postage to Holyhead    9_d._\r\n    For the Conway Bridge         1_d._\r\n     \"   \"  Menai    \"            1_d._\r\n     Sea postage                  2_d._\r\n                                 -----\r\n                                 13_d._\r\n\r\nIn 1820, the sea rate between Portpatrick and Donaghadee had been raised\r\nby 2_d._ for a single letter, between Liverpool and the Port of Douglas\r\nby 4_d._ (1 Geo. IV, c. 89; 3 Geo. IV, c. 105).\r\n\r\n[614] 7 and 8 Geo. IV, c. 21; 1 and 2 Geo. IV, c. 35, secs. 19-20; 6\r\nGeo. IV, c. 28.\r\n\r\n[615] 6 and 7 Wm. IV, c. 5.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, England and France signed a postal treaty by which the rates on\r\nletters between the United Kingdom and France or between any other\r\ncountry and the United Kingdom through France were materially\r\nreduced.[616] On such letters the method of reckoning postage differed\r\nfrom the English rule and was as follows: One sheet of paper not\r\nexceeding an ounce in weight and every letter not exceeding one quarter\r\nof an ounce were single letters. Every letter with one enclosure only\r\nand not exceeding an ounce in weight was a double letter. Every letter\r\ncontaining more than one enclosure and not exceeding half an ounce was a\r\ndouble letter. If it exceeded half an ounce but not an ounce in weight,\r\nit was a triple letter. If it exceeded an ounce, it paid as four single\r\nletters and for every quarter of an ounce above one ounce it paid an\r\nadditional single letter rate.[617] The sender of a letter from Great\r\nBritain to France had the option of prepaying the whole postage, British\r\nand foreign, or the British alone, or neither.[618]\r\n\r\n[616] _Acc. & P._, 1837, l. 106.

IV and 1 Vict., c. 34.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, an act of Parliament was passed, consolidating previous acts\r\nfor the regulation of postage rates within Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland, and between the United Kingdom and\r\nthe colonies and foreign countries. The rates within Great Britain\r\nremained the same as those established by the act of 1812, including the\r\nadditional half penny on letters conveyed by mail coaches in Scotland.\r\nIn Ireland the rates existing since 1814 still held and between Great\r\nBritain and Ireland the rates established by 7 and 8 Geo. IV, c. 21.\r\n\r\nThe rates for letters between the United Kingdom and foreign countries\r\nthrough France and those conveyed directly between the United Kingdom\r\nand France remained the same as had been agreed upon by the Treaty of\r\n1836. Some of the more important of the other rates were as follows:--\r\n\r\nTo Italy, Sicily, Venetian Lombardy, Malta, the Ionian Islands, Greece,\r\nTurkey, the Levant, the Archipelago, Syria, and Egypt through Belgium,\r\nHolland, or Germany, 20_d._ for a single letter. Between the United\r\nKingdom and Portugal, 19_d._ for a single letter.\r\n\r\n                                                         _Single letter_\r\nTo or from Gibraltar                                           23_d._\r\nTo or from Malta, the Ionian Islands, Greece, Syria, and Egypt 27_d._\r\nBetween Gibraltar (not having been first conveyed there from\r\nthe United Kingdom) and Malta, the Ionian Islands, Greece,\r\nSyria, or Egypt[619]                                            8_d._\r\nBetween the United Kingdom and Madeira                         20_d._\r\nBetween the United Kingdom and the West Indies, Colombia,\r\nand Mexico                                                     25_d._\r\nBetween the United Kingdom and Brazil                          31_d._\r\nBetween the United Kingdom and Buenos Ayres                    29_d._\r\nBetween the United Kingdom and San Domingo                     15_d._\r\nBetween the British West Indies and Colombia or Mexico         12_d._\r\n\r\n[619] In 1838, it was enacted that the postage on a single letter (not\r\nfrom the United Kingdom or going there) between any two Mediterranean\r\nports or from a Mediterranean port to the East Indies should be 6_d._\r\nvia the Red Sea or Persian Gulf. The Gibraltar rate remained the same (1\r\nand 2 Vict., c. 97).\r\n\r\nLetters between the United Kingdom and Germany, Belgium, Holland,\r\nSwitzerland, Spain, Sweden, and Norway were charged in addition the same\r\npostage as if they had been sent from or to London. Letters from and to\r\nFrance paid no additional postage. All letters to and from\r\nnon-commissioned officers, privates and seamen while in actual service\r\nwere still carried for one penny each, payable in advance, but letters\r\nsent by them from Ceylon, the East Indies, Mauritius, and the Cape were\r\ncharged an additional 2_d._ payable by the receiver.[620]\r\n\r\n[620] 7 Wm. IV and 1 Vict., c. 34.\r\n\r\nAfter the transference of the packet boats to the Admiralty in 1837, the\r\nPostmaster-General was authorized to charge regular packet rates for the\r\nconveyance of letters by such ships as he had contracted with for such\r\nconveyance. He might also forward letters by any ships and collect the\r\nfollowing rates for each single letter:--\r\n\r\n  When the letter was posted in the place from which\r\n  the ship sailed except when sailing between Great\r\n  Britain and Ireland                                  8_d._\r\n  If posted anywhere else in the United Kingdom       12_d._\r\n  Between Great Britain and Ireland in addition to\r\n  inland rates                                         8_d._\r\n  For a single letter coming into the United Kingdom\r\n  except from Ceylon, the East Indies, Mauritius, and\r\n  the Cape in addition to inland rates                 8_d._\r\n  For letters from Ceylon, the East Indies, Mauritius,\r\n  and the Cape in addition to inland rates--\r\n      If not exceeding 3 ounces in weight              4_d._\r\n      If exceeding 3 ounces in weight                 12_d._ an oz.\r\n  For letters delivered to the Post Office to be sent\r\n  to Ceylon, the East Indies, Mauritius, and the Cape\r\n  in addition to all inland rates--\r\n      If not exceeding 3 ounces in weight              2_d._\r\n      If exceeding 3 ounces in weight                 12_d._ an oz.[621]\r\n\r\n[621] 7 Wm. IV and I Vict., c. 34.\r\n\r\nThe end of high postage rates was now at hand. In 1839, the Treasury was\r\nempowered to change the rating according to the weight of the letter or\r\npackage,[622] and they proceeded to do so in the case of letters from\r\none country to another passing through the United Kingdom, between any\r\ntwo colonies, between any South American ports, and between such ports\r\nand Madeira and the Canaries.[623] Parliament followed up the good work\r\nin 1840 by enacting that in future all letters, packages, etc. should be\r\ncharged by weight alone, according to the following scheme:--\r\n\r\nOn every letter or package, etc.--\r\nNot exceeding 1/2 ounce in weight, one rate of postage.\r\nExceeding 1/2 ounce but not exceeding 1 ounce,  2 rates of postage.\r\n          1    \"     \"   \"    \"       2 ounces, 4   \"   \"    \"\r\n          2  ounces  \"   \"    \"       3  \"      6   \"   \"    \"\r\n          3    \"     \"   \"    \"       4  \"      8   \"   \"    \"\r\n\r\nFor every ounce above four ounces, two additional rates of postage, and\r\nfor every fraction of an ounce above four ounces as for one additional\r\nounce. No letter or package exceeding one pound in weight was to be sent\r\nthrough the Post Office except petitions and addresses to the Queen, or\r\nto either House of Parliament, or in such cases as the Treasury Lords\r\nmight order by warrant.[624]\r\n\r\n\r\n[622] 2 and 3 Vict., c. 52.\r\n\r\n[623] _Acc. & P._, 1841, xxvi, 53, pp. 1-7.\r\n\r\n[624] Additional exceptions were made later in the case of 1. Reissuable\r\ncountry bank notes delivered at the General Post Office in London. 2.\r\nDeeds, legal proceedings and papers. 3. Letters to and from places\r\nbeyond the seas. 4. Letters to and from any government office or\r\ndepartment (or to and from any person having the franking privilege by\r\nvirtue of his office). _Acc. & P._ 1841, xxvi, 53, p. 4.\r\n\r\nOn all letters not exceeding a half-ounce in weight transmitted by the\r\nPost between places in the United Kingdom (not being letters sent to or\r\nfrom places beyond the seas, or posted in any post town to be delivered\r\nwithin that town) there was charged a uniform rate of one penny. For all\r\nletters exceeding a half-ounce in weight, additional rates were charged\r\naccording to the foregoing scheme, each additional rate for letters\r\nexceeding one ounce in weight being fixed at 2_d._[625]\r\n\r\n[625] Double rates were charged when the postage was paid on delivery.\r\n\r\nThe rates for colonial letters were also adjusted according to weight as\r\nfollows: Between any place in the United Kingdom and any port in the\r\ncolonies and India (except when passing through France) for a letter not\r\nexceeding half an ounce in weight, 1_s._ Between any of the colonies\r\nthrough the United Kingdom, 2_s._ If such letters exceeded half an ounce\r\nin weight, they were charged additional rates according to the table\r\nalready given, the rate for a letter not exceeding half an ounce being\r\ntaken as the basis.\r\n\r\nThe rates for letters to and from foreign countries were much the same\r\nas they had been before the passage of this act, except that instead of\r\nthe initial charge being made for a single letter, it was now reckoned\r\nfor a letter not exceeding half an ounce in weight. The rates for\r\nletters to and from France were graded according to the distance they\r\nwere carried in England, the lowest rate for a letter not more than half\r\nan ounce in weight being 3_d._ to Dover or the port of arrival, the\r\nhighest rate being 10_d._ to any place distant more than fifty miles\r\nfrom Dover.[626]\r\n\r\n[626] 3 and 4 Vict., c. 96.\r\n\r\nThe franking privilege may reasonably be considered in connection with\r\nthe history of postal rates, nor should its effect in reducing the\r\nrevenue of the Post Office be neglected. The Council of State gave\r\norders in 1652 that all public packets, letters of members of\r\nParliament, of the Council, of officers in the public service, and of\r\nany persons acting in a public capacity should be carried free. This is\r\nthe first record that we have concerning the free carriage of members'\r\nletters, a privilege which later gave so much trouble and was so much\r\nabused.[627] The next year the Post Office farmers agreed to carry free\r\nall letters to and from members of Parliament provided that letters\r\nwritten by such members as were not known by their seals should be\r\nendorsed, \"These are for the service of the Commonwealth,\" and signed by\r\nthe members themselves or their clerks.[628] Nothing was said in the act\r\nof 1660 about the conveyance of the letters of members of Parliament and\r\nthey were carried free only by act of grace. The House of Commons had\r\npassed a clause of the bill providing for the free conveyance of the\r\nletters of members of their own House. This had exasperated the Lords,\r\nwho, since they could not amend the clause so as to extend the privilege\r\nto themselves, had dropped it.[629] In 1693, the attention of Cotton and\r\nFrankland was called to the manner in which franking was being abused.\r\nMen claimed the right to frank letters to whom the Postmasters-General\r\ndenied it, and members of Parliament were accused of bad faith in the\r\nexercise of their privilege. The custom had arisen of enclosing private\r\nletters in the packet of official letters. A warrant was issued in 1693\r\nto the effect that in future no letters were to go free except those on\r\nthe King's affairs, and the only persons to send or receive them free\r\nwere the two principal Secretaries of State, the Secretary for Scotland,\r\nthe Secretary in Holland, the Earl of Portland, and members of\r\nParliament, the latter only during the session, and for forty days\r\nbefore and after, and for inland letters alone. Each member was to write\r\nhis name in a book with his seal so that no one might be able to\r\ncounterfeit his signature.[630]\r\n\r\n[627] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1651-52, p. 507.\r\n\r\n[628] _Cal. S. P.

These gazettes or news letters were supplied by\r\nthe Treasury and, as 2_d._ or 3_d._ apiece was paid for them by the\r\nrecipients, the privilege was greatly esteemed.[631] The Deputy\r\nPostmaster-General wished to abolish the privilege, but Hicks himself,\r\nwho was one of the favoured officials, was quite indignant at the\r\nsuggestion.[632] The principle was bad, but as the receipts for gazettes\r\nformed a necessary part of the clerks' salaries, Hicks cannot be blamed\r\nfor protesting against abolition without compensation. James II\r\nexpressed a desire that the practice should be discontinued, but when it\r\nwas shown to him that the salaries of the clerks must be raised if his\r\nwishes were obeyed, his proposition was promptly withdrawn.[633]\r\n\r\n[631] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1731-34, pp. 208, 210, 218, 268.\r\n\r\n[632] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1667, p. 248.\r\n\r\n[633] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1666-67, p.386.\r\n\r\nThe abuses of the privilege of franking were very pronounced during the\r\neighteenth century. The system of patronage which the members of\r\nParliament then exercised made them reluctant to offend any of their\r\nconstituents, who might entrench upon their peculiar privileges.\r\nMembers' names were forged to letters and they made no complaint.\r\nLetters from the country were sent to them to be re-addressed under\r\ntheir own signatures. The Postmasters-General admonished them more than\r\nonce, but, as a rule, the members disclaimed all knowledge of abuses.\r\nMen were so bold as to order letters to be sent under a member's name to\r\ncoffee-houses, where they presented themselves and demanded the letters\r\nso addressed. In 1715, on receiving renewed complaints from the\r\nPostmasters-General, it was ordered by the House that henceforth no\r\nmember should frank a letter unless the address were written entirely in\r\nhis own hand. This was expected to prevent members from franking letters\r\nsent to them by friends. It was also ordered that no letter addressed to\r\na member should pass free unless such member was actually residing at\r\nthe place to which the letter was addressed. In the third place, no\r\nmember was to frank a newspaper unless it was entirely in print. This\r\nwas to prevent the franking of long written communications passing as\r\nnewspapers, for the members of Parliament in sending and receiving\r\nletters free were restricted to such as did not exceed two ounces in\r\nweight, but they were not so restricted in the case of newspapers.[634]\r\nAccording to the Surveyor's report, the loss from the ministers' franks\r\nin 1717 was £8270 and from the members' franks £17,470.[635] The loss\r\nfrom franking was proportionately much greater in Ireland than in\r\nEngland. In 1718 the Irish Parliament sat only three months, in 1719\r\nnine months, and in Ireland as in England, members of Parliament\r\nreceived and sent their letters free only during the session and forty\r\ndays before and after it. The following is part of the report submitted\r\nby the Postmasters-General to the Lords of the Treasury for these two\r\nyears:--\r\n\r\n                                                 1718       1719\r\n  Gross Produce from Letters                   £14,592    £19,522\r\n  Charge of Management and Members' Letters     11,526     18,768\r\n  Net Produce from Letters[636]                  3,066        754\r\n\r\nUnder the charges of management is included the charge for carrying\r\nmembers' letters as reckoned proportionately to the charge for the\r\nletters which paid, together with the actual charge for the pay letters.\r\nThe net produce during the three months' session was £3006, during the\r\nnine months' session only £753. In 1734 the old orders about the maximum\r\nweight of two ounces and the requirement for the whole superscription to\r\nbe in the member's own writing were repeated in a royal proclamation. In\r\naddition it was ordered that any letters sent under cover to any member\r\nof Parliament or high official of state, to be forwarded by him, should\r\nbe sent to the General Post Office to be taxed.[637] It could hardly be\r\nexpected that this order would be obeyed, for there was no method of\r\nenforcing it.\r\n\r\n[634] _Jo. H. C._, 1714-18, p. 303.\r\n\r\n[635] _Cal. T. P._, 1714-19, p. 287.\r\n\r\n[636] _Cal. T. P._, 1720-28, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[637] _Jo. H. C._, 1732-37, p. 393.\r\n\r\nIn 1735, the House of Commons instituted an enquiry into the whole\r\nquestion of franking and summoned various Post Office officials before\r\nthem to give evidence. An estimate was laid before them of the amount\r\nlost each year by carrying franked letters. This estimate was obtained\r\nby weighing the franked letters at intervals during the session of\r\nParliament, and comparing their weight with the weight of the letters\r\nwhich paid postage. As the total revenue from the latter was known, the\r\namount which was lost on the former was guessed. The House expressed\r\nvery little confidence in the estimated amounts, and certainly it was a\r\nrough way of attaining the object aimed at, but perhaps they were\r\nprejudiced from the strength of the case against them.[638] Expressed in\r\nyearly averages, the amounts by which the revenue was reduced by\r\nfranking were:--\r\n\r\n  1716-19    £17,460\r\n  1720-24     23,726\r\n  1725-29     32,364\r\n  1730-33     36,864\r\n\r\n[638] _Ibid._, 1732-37.\r\n\r\nThe system of ascertaining forged franks and of discovering enclosures\r\nwas as follows: a Supervisor of the Franks charged all letters, franked\r\nby a member's name, coming from any place, when he knew that the member\r\nwas not there. Very often by holding them in front of a candle, he could\r\nsee enclosures inside directed to other people. If he was in doubt he\r\ngenerally charged the letter, for if it should pay, all well and good,\r\nand if he had made a mistake, the amount was refunded to the member. The\r\nSupervisor had noticed that the number of franked letters had increased\r\nwith every session of Parliament, and some of the ex-members also\r\nattempted to frank letters. The evidence of the Supervisor, especially\r\nhis description of the manner in which he attempted to discover\r\nenclosures, was exceedingly distasteful to the House. The members\r\nthemselves were to blame for many of the abuses attendant upon the\r\nsystem, and yet they contended that they were the unwilling victims of\r\nothers. A resolution was adopted that it was an infringement upon the\r\nprivileges of the knights, citizens, and burgesses chosen to represent\r\nthe people of Great Britain in Parliament, for any postmaster, his\r\ndeputies or agents to open or look into any letter addressed to or\r\nsigned by a member of Parliament, unless empowered so to do by a warrant\r\nissued by one of the Secretaries of State. In addition no postmaster or\r\nhis deputies should delay or detain any letter directed to or by any\r\nmember unless there should be good reason to suppose that the frank was\r\na counterfeit.[639]\r\n\r\n[639] _Jo. H. C._, 1732-37, p. 476.\r\n\r\nThe restrictions adopted to curtail the abuse of the franking privilege\r\nhad but little effect. A regular business sprang up for selling\r\ncounterfeit franks. The House of Lords ordered one person accused of\r\nselling them to come before the bar of the House for examination, but he\r\nfailed to present himself.[640] Another confessed before the Upper House\r\nthat he had counterfeited one of the Lords' names on certain covers of\r\nletters showed to him and had then sold them. He expressed sorrow for\r\nthe offence, which necessity had driven him to commit. He was sent to\r\nNewgate.[641] The abuses of the franking system were so patent[642]\r\nthat Allen was told that he might withdraw from his contract to farm the\r\nbye and cross post letters on three months' notice being given.[643]\r\n\r\n[640] _Jo. H. L._, 1736-41, p. 259.\r\n\r\n[641] _Ibid._, p. 529.\r\n\r\n[642] One man in five months counterfeited 14,400 franks of members of\r\nParliament. Counterfeits of names of 27 members were shown. A regular\r\ntrade in buying and selling them had sprung up (_Jo. H. C._, 1761-64, p.\r\n998). Several Lords certified that their names had been counterfeited.\r\nLord Dacre's name had been counterfeited 504 times (_Jo. H. L._,\r\n1760-64, p. 534).\r\n\r\n[643] _Cal. T. B. & P._, 1739-41, p. 450.\r\n\r\nThe revenue from the Post Office was surrendered by the Crown at the\r\nbeginning of George the Third's reign in exchange for a Civil List from\r\nthe Aggregate Fund as it was then called.[644] While the Post Office\r\nremained in the hands of the King, it was only by special grant on his\r\npart that the members of Parliament had been allowed to send and receive\r\nletters free. Accordingly in 1763, an act was passed for the purpose of\r\ngiving parliamentary sanction to the privilege. This act repeated the\r\nprincipal points in the King's proclamation and in the Parliament's\r\nprevious resolutions on the subject. All letters or packets sent to or\r\nby the King, the ministers and the higher Post Office officials were to\r\ngo free. The ministers might appoint others to frank their letters,\r\nwhose names must be forwarded to the Postmaster-General. Those sending\r\nletters free must sign their names on the outside and themselves write\r\nthe address. No letters to or from any member of Parliament should go\r\nfree unless they were sent during the session or within forty days\r\nbefore or after, and the whole superscription must be in the member's\r\nown hand or directed to him at his usual place of residence or at the\r\nHouse. All letters in excess of two ounces in weight must pay postage.\r\nPrinted votes, proceedings in Parliament, and newspapers should go free\r\nwhen sent to a member or signed on the outside by him, provided they\r\nwere sent without covers or with covers open at the ends. The privileges\r\nof franking votes, proceedings in Parliament, and newspapers, were\r\ncontinued to the clerks in the Post Office and in the Secretaries of\r\nState's offices. The Postmasters-General and their deputies were given\r\nauthority to search newspapers which had no covers or covers open at the\r\nends and to charge them if there were writing or enclosures in them.\r\nFinally, any person who counterfeited a member's name on any letter or\r\npackage for the purpose of avoiding the payment of postage, was guilty\r\nof felony and liable to transportation for seven years.[645]\r\n\r\n[644] Joyce, p. 189.\r\n\r\n[645] 4 Geo. III, c. 24.\r\n\r\nThe year following the passing of this act, the House of Commons called\r\nfor returns relating to the franking system. Besides the members of\r\nParliament, the ministers, and the Post Office officials, to whom the\r\nfranking privilege had been granted by the King's warrant and by the\r\nlate act, almost all who were in any way connected with the Government\r\nclaimed the right to send or receive letters free, even to the Deputy\r\nSerjeant-at-Arms. The amount which newspapers would have paid if there\r\nhad been no franking privilege was first given for the week ending March\r\n13, 1764.\r\n\r\n  _Members'_       _States'_     _Post Office Clerks'_\r\n     £465            £310                 £1055\r\n\r\nThese amounts were obtained by weighing the newspapers and, as this was\r\nthe manner in which they would have been rated, the results may be\r\nconsidered as fairly correct. The idea being to estimate the loss from\r\nmembers' and states' franks only, the franking by Post Office clerks\r\ndoes not enter into the following calculation. It was judged from the\r\nfigures given above that the Post Office carried free every year enough\r\nnewspapers franked by members and state officials to produce £40,000 if\r\nthey had been taxed at the ordinary rates.[646] An attempt to arrive at\r\nthe same result in another way was also made. The sum total which would\r\nhave been paid on all members' and ministers' letters, newspapers, and\r\nparcels arriving at or departing from London in 1763 was £140,000. Of\r\nthis amount £85,000 would have been paid on all mail leaving London, and\r\n£55,000 on all mail arriving in London. The difference in favour of the\r\noutgoing mail was judged to be due to the newspapers, all of which were\r\nprinted in London and sent to the country. This would give a loss of\r\n£30,000 on newspapers, and £110,000 on letters.[647]\r\n\r\n[646] _Jo. H. C._, 1761-64, pp. 1000-1001.\r\n\r\n[647] _Ibid._, p. 999.\r\n\r\nReturns were also submitted, showing the gross amount of the inland\r\npostage for Great Britain and Ireland, including the amount which the\r\nfranked letters and papers would have paid if they had all been charged,\r\nthe actual gross product and the difference between the two. This\r\ndifference would, of course, be the estimated charge on all the free\r\nmatter. These figures are given from 1715 to 1763. Roughly speaking, in\r\nfifty years franked letters and papers increased 700 per cent while pay\r\nletters increased only 50 per cent. In 1715 one fifth as many free\r\nletters and newspapers as those which paid went through the mail. In\r\n1763 there were eleven twelfths as many free letters and papers.[648] It\r\nwill be seen that the assumption is that the postage which this free\r\nmatter might have paid represented the loss suffered by the Post Office.\r\nNow this is not so, because it did not cost the Post Office so much to\r\nconvey letters and papers as the ordinary rates would have paid them. In\r\nthe second place the Postal authorities considered the £140,000 as so\r\nmuch actually lost, whereas if charges had been enforced on the free\r\nmatter, a much smaller amount would have been sent. This is entirely\r\napart from the rough and ready manner in which the figures were\r\nobtained. Enough was shown, however, to prove that the franking system\r\nwas a burden to the country and an imposition upon the Post Office.\r\n\r\n[648] _Jo. H. C._, p. 999.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, Parliament met as a rule only during the even years or if it\r\nmet every year, the sessions in the odd years were very short. For the\r\nfive even years from 1753 to 1762, the expenses averaged for each year\r\n£3306 over the receipts, while during the five odd years, the receipts\r\nwere greater than the expenditures by a yearly average of £2249. These\r\ngeneral results held good for every individual odd or even year for the\r\nperiod for which returns were given.[649]\r\n\r\n[649] _Ibid._, 1761-64, p. 1001.\r\n\r\nAttempts continued to be made by members of the House of Commons to\r\ndiminish the abuses arising from franking. There had been some\r\nmisunderstanding as to whether they were entitled to have ship's letters\r\ndelivered free to them. Of course they were exempt from the inland\r\npostage on such letters, but for every letter brought into the country\r\nby vessels other than packets, the master was paid one penny and this\r\npenny was collected from the person to whom the letter was delivered.\r\nThe members finally agreed to pay the extra penny.[650]\r\n\r\n[650] _Ibid._, 1780-82, p. 537.\r\n\r\nActs were now introduced to enable the Commander-in-Chief, the\r\nAdjutant-General, and the Controller of Accounts of the Royal forces to\r\nreceive and send letters free. Both bills passed.[651] It is some\r\nconsolation that the Lord Chancellor and Judges failed to obtain the\r\nfranking privilege although a bill was introduced in the Commons in\r\ntheir behalf.[652]\r\n\r\n[651] 22 Geo. III, c. 70; 23 Geo. III, c. 69.\r\n\r\n[652] _Jo. H. C._, 1790-91, p. 468.\r\n\r\nIt was enacted in 1784 that a member must write on his free letters not\r\nonly his name and address but also the name of the post town from which\r\nthey were to be sent and the day of the month and the year when they\r\nwere posted.[653] The object of this restriction could be easily evaded\r\nby enclosing postdated letters to their constituents but, after the\r\npassage of this resolution, a considerable decrease resulted in the\r\nnumber of free letters to and from members.[654] When the Irish was\r\nseparated from the English Post Office, the privilege of franking\r\nnewspapers to Ireland was taken away and a rate of one penny a newspaper\r\nwas imposed, payable in advance. This meant a loss to the clerks in the\r\nSecretaries' offices but this was made good to them by an addition of\r\n£1000 a year to their salaries.[655]\r\n\r\n[653] _Ibid._, 1784-85, p. 383. The Lords also agreed to this resolution\r\n(ibid., p.411; 24 Geo. III, sess. 2, c. 37).\r\n\r\n[654] For the years 1783 and 1784, the number of free letters arriving\r\nin London, exclusive of the state's letters, averaged over 800,000 a\r\nyear and those sent from London averaged over 1,000,000. In 1785, they\r\nhad fallen to 514,000 and 713,000 respectively (_Parl. Papers_, 1812-13,\r\n_Rep. Com._, ii, 222, p. 95).\r\n\r\n[655] 24 Geo. III, c. 6; _Jo. H. C._, 1795-96, p. 588.\r\n\r\nIn 1795, the members of Parliament made another attempt to limit their\r\nown as well as the free writing proclivities of others. The maximum\r\nweight of a free letter to or from a member was lowered from two ounces\r\nto one. No letter directed by a member should go free unless the member\r\nso directing it should be within twenty miles of the place where it was\r\nposted either on the day on which it was posted or the day before. No\r\nmember should send more than ten or receive more than fifteen free\r\nletters a day. Votes and proceedings in Parliament when addressed to or\r\nby members of Parliament were exempted from the provisions of this\r\nAct.[656]\r\n\r\n[656] 35 Geo. III, c. 53. After 1786 the number of franked letters had\r\ngradually increased until checked by this act. In 1795 the number of\r\nfranked letters delivered in London was 1,045,000, the number sent from\r\nLondon 1,195,000. In 1796, the inward and outward free letters amounted\r\nto 737,000 and 787,000 respectively. In 1797 the numbers were 696,000\r\nand 721,000. These restricting acts of 1784 and 1795 had a more\r\nimportant effect than Joyce leads us to suppose (_Parl. Papers_,\r\n1812-13, _Rep. Com._, ii, 222, p. 95).\r\n\r\nThe restrictions upon the franking privilege enjoyed by members of\r\nParliament were re-enacted in 1802 with some additions. The number of\r\nfree letters which a member might receive and send in one day having\r\nbeen limited to twenty-five, it was decided that these twenty-five so\r\nexcepted from the payment of postage should be those on which the\r\ncharges were the highest, provided that none of them exceeded an ounce\r\nin weight. The high officials of state, the clerks of Parliament,\r\ncertain clerks of the Commons and Lords, the Treasurer and Paymaster of\r\nthe Navy, the Lord Chancellor, certain officials in Ireland, and two\r\npersons appointed by the Postmaster-General of Ireland were allowed to\r\nsend letters free.[657] The members and clerks of both Houses were\r\nallowed to send newspapers free provided that they were enclosed in\r\ncovers open at both ends. The same rule held for votes and proceedings\r\nin Parliament.[658] The same franking privileges were extended to Irish\r\nofficials.[659]\r\n\r\n[657] Those officials in the General Post Office who had no franking\r\nprivilege were reimbursed the amount of postage paid by them on inland\r\nsingle letters (_Rep. Commrs._, 1837, xxxiv, 8th rep., app., no. 2).\r\n\r\n[658] 42 Geo. III, c. 63.\r\n\r\n[659] 43 Geo. III, c. 28.\r\n\r\nFrom 1806 to 1819 there was a large extension of the franking privilege\r\nto various officials. During that time sixteen statutes and parts of\r\nstatutes were enacted in behalf of various persons from the Lord High\r\nChancellor to the Controller of the Barrack's Department and the\r\nCommissioners of the parliamentary grant for building churches. Sir\r\nRobert Buxton, a member of Parliament, thought that it would be well for\r\nhis fellow members to give up their privilege in order to help the\r\nfinances of the country. Windham disagreed on the ground that it kept up\r\ncommunications between a member and his constituents and encouraged\r\nliterary correspondence which would otherwise decline. Pitt justified\r\nit, in that it enabled members to carry on the important business of\r\ntheir constituents and did not result in much loss to the state.[660]\r\n\r\n[660] _Parl. Deb._, 1st ser., iii, col. 570. The following are a few of\r\nthe statutes enacted which extended franking: 46 Geo. III, c. 61; 50\r\nGeo. III, c. 65, sec. 19; c. 66; 51 Geo. III, c. 16, sec. 17; 52 Geo.\r\nIII, c. 132, sec. 16; c. 146, sec. 11; 53 Geo. III, c. 13; 54 Geo. III,\r\nc. 169; 55 Geo. III, c. 1, sec. 10; c. 60, secs. 41-42; 56 Geo. III, c.\r\n98, sec. 24.\r\n\r\nIt had always been customary to charge letter rates for the conveyance\r\nof newspapers to foreign countries and to the colonies. Members of\r\nParliament, however, had the privilege of franking newspapers within the\r\nUnited Kingdom, the clerks of the Foreign Office franked them to foreign\r\ncountries, and the Secretary of the Post Office franked them to the\r\ncolonies. In 1825 it was enacted that members need no longer sign their\r\nnames to newspapers franked by them, or give notice of the names of the\r\nplaces to which they intended to send them.[661] This virtually provided\r\nfor the free transmission of newspapers within the United Kingdom. At\r\nthe same time it was provided that the rate for newspapers, votes and\r\nparliamentary proceedings should be 1-1/2_d._ each to the colonies,\r\npayable in advance. Newspapers from the colonies were charged 3_d._\r\neach, payable on delivery. Such newspapers must be posted on the day of\r\npublication, must contain no writing, and must be enclosed in covers\r\nopen at both ends.[662] Two years later the charge for votes and\r\nparliamentary proceedings to and from the colonies was fixed at\r\n1-1/2_d._ an ounce. Newspapers brought from the colonies by private\r\nvessels were to be charged 3_d._ each, the same as the packet rate,[663]\r\nbut in 1835 colonial newspapers by private vessels were allowed to come\r\nin for a penny each, and the same rate was charged for English\r\nnewspapers sent to the colonies by private vessels. By the same act the\r\npostage on newspapers passing between the United Kingdom and any foreign\r\ncountry which charged no inland rate for their conveyance was fixed at a\r\npenny each. If an inland rate was charged, the postage was to be 2_d._\r\nfor each newspaper plus the foreign rate.[664]\r\n\r\n[661] 6 Geo. IV, c. 68, sec. 10.\r\n\r\n[662] 6 Geo. IV, c. 68; London _Times_, 1825, June 11, p. 3; July 29, p.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n[663] 7 and 8 Geo. IV, c. 21.\r\n\r\n[664] 5 and 6 Wm. IV, c. 25. Before the passage of this act newspapers\r\npassed free by the packets and posts to and from Hamburg, Bremen, and\r\nCuxhaven (London _Times_, 1834, Oct. 30, p. 2).\r\n\r\nDuring the following year, all the regulations concerning the conveyance\r\nof newspapers, votes, and proceedings in Parliament etc. were embodied\r\nin one act. Within the United Kingdom all newspapers which had paid the\r\nstamp duty were to go free except those which were sent through the\r\nTwopenny Post and delivered by it, not having passed by the General\r\nPost, and except those posted and delivered within the same town. In\r\nboth of these cases one penny was charged. To and from the colonies no\r\nrate was demanded when newspapers were sent by the regular packets. If\r\nsent by private vessels one penny was payable, which went to the master.\r\nThe rate to and from foreign countries was fixed at 2_d._ for each\r\npaper, but if a foreign state agreed to charge no postage on English\r\nnewspapers, no postage should be charged on the newspapers of such\r\nforeign state, when brought to England by the packet boats. If brought\r\nby private vessels, a penny was payable for each paper, to go to the\r\nmaster. All newspapers, in order to receive the advantage of these low\r\nrates or to go free, had to be posted within seven days after\r\npublication and to contain no writing except the name and address of the\r\nperson to whom they were to be sent. In addition the newspaper must have\r\nno cover or one open at both ends.[665]\r\n\r\n[665] 6 and 7 Wm. IV, c. 25.\r\n\r\nThe following additions and changes in the regulations for the carriage\r\nof newspapers were made in 1837. One penny was to be paid for their\r\nconveyance by private vessels between different parts of the United\r\nKingdom. Between the colonies and foreign countries through the United\r\nKingdom, newspapers should go free if conveyed by the packets and should\r\npay a penny each if conveyed by private vessels. Parliamentary\r\nproceedings conveyed between the colonies and the United Kingdom, if\r\nsent by packet boats and not exceeding one ounce in weight, were charged\r\n1-1/2_d._ each. When in excess of one ounce they paid 1-1/2_d._ for each\r\nadditional ounce. Pamphlets, magazines and other periodical publications\r\nfor the colonies, if not exceeding six ounces in weight, paid 12_d._\r\nwhen carried by the packets. For every additional ounce, 3_d._ was\r\ncharged. Bankers' re-issuable notes were carried at one quarter the\r\nregular postage.[666] Patterns, with no writing enclosed and not\r\nexceeding one ounce in weight, paid a single letter rate.[667] Any\r\nnewspaper which had been posted in violation of any regulation for the\r\nconveyance of newspapers was charged three times the regular letter\r\npostage.[668]\r\n\r\n[666] In Great Britain re-issuable notes of country banks paid in London\r\nwere conveyed by the post to the issuing bank at one quarter the regular\r\nrates for letters, but parcels of notes had to exceed six ounces in\r\nweight and contain no other matter (5 Geo. IV, c. 20).\r\n\r\n[667] 7 Wm. IV and 1 Vict., c. 34.\r\n\r\n[668] 7 Wm. IV. and 1 Vict., c. 36.\r\n\r\nFranking and the privilege of sending and receiving letters free from\r\npostage did not at any time extend to letters liable to foreign postage\r\nexcept in the case of public despatches to and from the Secretaries of\r\nState and British Ambassadors.[669] The owners, charterers and\r\nconsignees of vessels inward bound were allowed to receive letters free\r\nfrom sea postage to the maximum of six ounces for each man, but in the\r\ncase of ships coming from the East Indies, Ceylon, Mauritius, and the\r\nCape, the maximum was twenty ounces.[670] Within the kingdom, writs for\r\nthe election of members of the House of Commons and for those Scotch and\r\nIrish peers who were elected, were allowed to go free.[671] All persons\r\nwho were allowed to frank letters within the Kingdom were grouped in ten\r\nclasses. Members of Parliament were placed in the first class and their\r\nletters were subject to the old restrictions as to number,[672]\r\nsuperscription, name of post town, date, and place of residence. They\r\nmight also receive petitions free, provided that each did not exceed six\r\nounces in weight. They might send free printed votes and proceedings in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n[669] 5 and 6 Wm. IV, c. 25.\r\n\r\n[670] 7 Wm. IV and 1 Vict., c. 34. Maximum increased to thirty ounces by\r\n7 Wm. IV and 1 Vict., c. 25.\r\n\r\n[671] 53 Geo. III, c. 89; 7 Wm. IV and 1 Vict., c. 32.\r\n\r\n[672] Wallace, the postal reformer, declared that other members had been\r\nin the habit of receiving more than fifteen free letters in a day and\r\nthat, too, with Freeling's consent (_Parl. Deb._, 3d series, xxiv, col.\r\n1001).\r\n\r\nOfficials of both Houses of Parliament were in the second class. They\r\nwere subject to the same restrictions as the first class, except that\r\nthe number of their letters was not limited and each letter might weigh\r\ntwo ounces.\r\n\r\nThe third class was composed of members of the Treasury Department and\r\nthe Postmaster-General and his secretaries. Their franking privilege was\r\nunlimited as to the weight and number of letters nor were they required\r\nto insert the name of the post town or the date.\r\n\r\nThe fourth class, composed of heads of departments, might send and\r\nreceive letters with no limit as to number or weight.\r\n\r\nThe fifth class, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and the Irish\r\nSurveyors, had unlimited franking rights within Ireland. All the letters\r\nof these five classes were subject to the following restrictions with\r\nthe exception of the third class. The whole superscription of the\r\nletters sent must be in the hand of the privileged person, with his name\r\nand the name of the post town from which the letters were sent together\r\nwith the date, and on that date or the day before, the writer must be\r\nwithin twenty miles of the place where the letters were posted.\r\n\r\nThe other five classes were made up of subordinate members of\r\ndepartments, clerks, secretaries etc. when writing or receiving letters\r\non official business. Every such letter had to be superscribed with the\r\nname of the office and the seal and name of the writer.[673]\r\n\r\n[673] 7 Wm. IV. and 1 Vict., c. 35.\r\n\r\nIt appeared from a report of a committee appointed to investigate postal\r\naffairs that the total number of franks had increased from 3,039,000 in\r\n1810 to 4,142,000 in 1820; 4,792,000 in 1830 and 5,270,000 in 1837. Of\r\nthese, members of the two Houses were responsible for 2,028,000;\r\n2,726,000; 2,814,000 and 3,084,000 at the above dates respectively.[674]\r\nIn concluding their report the Committee recommended the abolition of\r\nParliamentary franking.[675] This advice was followed and improved upon\r\ntwo years later when franking and the privilege of sending or receiving\r\nletters free were abolished, except in the case of petitions to the\r\nQueen or Parliament not exceeding 32 ounces in weight.[676]\r\n\r\n[674] _Rep. Com._, 1837-38, xx, 2d rep., app., p. 109.\r\n\r\n[675] _Ibid._, xx, 3d rep., p. 62.\r\n\r\n[676] 3 and 4 Vict., c. 96. Recent attempts by certain members of\r\nParliament to revive the franking privilege have fortunately been\r\nunsuccessful (_Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., lxxxi, col. 1407; civ, col. 360).\r\n\r\nNo further reduction in inland postage rates was adopted until the net\r\nrevenue of the Post Office had pretty well recovered from the blow\r\nreceived by the adoption of penny postage.[677] Such reduction was\r\nfinally granted in 1865, applying only to letters weighing more than one\r\nounce each, the increases in weight being graduated by half ounces with\r\na penny for each additional half ounce instead of 2_d._ for each\r\nadditional ounce as before. Corresponding reductions were made at the\r\nsame time in the book post and the pattern and sample post, and were\r\nmade applicable to correspondence with British North America and the\r\nBritish possessions in Europe.[678] In 1870, when the impressed\r\nnewspaper stamp was finally abolished, the rate on prepaid newspapers\r\nwas reduced to a halfpenny each whether sent singly or in packages, but\r\nno package was to be charged higher than the book post rate. Unpaid\r\nnewspapers were charged a penny for each two ounces or fraction thereof.\r\nThe book post rate was reduced at the same time to a halfpenny for each\r\ntwo ounces or fraction thereof. The rate for patterns and samples, which\r\nhad formerly been 2_d._ for the initial four ounces, was altered to the\r\nexisting book post rate with a maximum of twelve ounces only. In 1871\r\nthe inland letter rate was fixed at a penny for the initial ounce, a\r\nhalfpenny for the next ounce and for each additional two ounces, and the\r\nsample and pattern post was incorporated with the inland letter post. A\r\nseparate sample and pattern post was reëstablished in 1887, only to be\r\nincorporated for a second time with the letter post ten years\r\nlater.[679] An additional charge for re-directed letters was made when\r\nthe re-direction necessitated a change from the original delivery, but\r\nthe charge was such only as they would be liable to if prepaid. An\r\nexception was made in the case of letters re-directed to sailors or\r\nsoldiers, no additional charge being then made, provided that the rate\r\nwas not a foreign one. This privilege was later extended to commissioned\r\nofficers and the exemption extended to foreign rates as well.[680] In\r\n1891 all charges for the re-direction of letters were abolished,\r\nfollowed three years later by a like abolition in the case of all other\r\npostal matter, and in 1900 the charge for notice of removal and\r\nre-direction after the first year was reduced from £1 1_s._ to 1_s._ for\r\nthe second and third and 5_s._ for subsequent years.[681]\r\n\r\n[677] But in 1861 the registration fee was reduced from 6_d._ to 4_d._\r\nand a double fee charged for compulsory registration (_Rep. P. G._,\r\n1862, pp. 9-10).\r\n\r\n[678] _Rep. P. G._, 1866, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[679] _Ibid._, 1870, pp. 3-5; 1897, p. 5; 1896, p. 2; 1898, pp. 1-2.\r\n\r\n[680] 3 and 4 Vict., c. 96; 10 and 11 Vict., c. 85; 23 and 24 Vict., c.\r\n65.\r\n\r\n[681] _Rep. P. G._, 1892, p. 8; 1894, p.2; 1895, p. 4; 1901, p. 4.\r\n\r\nWith an increase in the number of valuable articles carried by post and\r\nbetter arrangements for their safe keeping, it was found possible to\r\nreduce the registration fee from 11_d._ to 6_d._, then to 4_d._ and\r\neventually to 2_d._ At the time of the first reduction, a rule was\r\nissued for the compulsory registration by the Post Office of all letters\r\nunquestionably containing coin, for the sake of letter carriers and\r\nothers rather than the protection of the public. The Post Office did not\r\nat the time of the first reduction hold itself responsible for the full\r\nvalue of the contents of a lost registered letter but was accustomed to\r\nremunerate the sender where the contents were proved, were of moderate\r\namount, and the fault clearly lay with the Post Office. In 1878 it\r\nagreed to make good up to £2 the value of the contents of any registered\r\nletter which it lost, stipulating in the case of money that it had been\r\nsent securely and in one of its own envelopes. Compulsory registration\r\nby the Post Office was also extended to include uncrossed cheques and\r\npostal orders to which the name of the payee had not been appended.[682]\r\n\r\n[682] _Rep._ P. G., 1862, pp. 9-10; 1879, p. 13; 1897, p. 5.\r\n\r\nAn inland parcel post was not established in England until 1883. An\r\ninitial rate of 3_d._ was imposed for the first pound, increasing by\r\nincrements of 3_d._ to 1_s._ for the seventh pound. Later the maximum\r\nweight was increased to 11 pounds, the maximum charge to 1_s._ 6_d._ In\r\n1905 a further reduction followed on parcels weighing more than four\r\npounds.[683]\r\n\r\n[683] _Ibid._, 1896, p. 3; 1882, p. 3; 1906, p. 1.\r\n\r\nThe use of postcards was first permitted in England in 1870, a charge of\r\na halfpenny a dozen being made in addition to the stamp. In 1875 this\r\nadditional charge was increased to a penny a dozen for thin cards, 2_d._\r\nfor stout cards. In 1899 these prices were reduced to a penny for ten\r\nstout cards, a halfpenny for ten thin ones, and the latter began rapidly\r\nto displace the former. Private post cards were first allowed to pass\r\nthrough the post in 1894 for a halfpenny each, and two years later the\r\ncharge on unpaid inland post cards was reduced from 2_d._ to a\r\npenny.[684] At the same time that the use of post cards was allowed, a\r\nhalf penny post was introduced for certain classes of formal printed\r\ndocuments.[685]\r\n\r\n[684] _Ibid._, 1896, p. 2; 1889, p. 2; 1897, p. 5; 1895, p. 18.\r\n\r\n[685] _Ibid._, 1903, p. 5.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the scale of postage applicable to inland letters between two\r\nand twelve ounces in weight was continued without limit. The resulting\r\nrates were as follows: for the first ounce, one penny; for two ounces,\r\n1-1/2_d._; for all greater weights, a halfpenny for every two ounces\r\nplus an initial penny. On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of\r\nthe late Queen's accession to the throne, further decreases were\r\nannounced in the postage on inland letters. The weight carried by the\r\ninitial penny was extended from one to four ounces, the postage for\r\nheavier letters increasing as before at the rate of a halfpenny for each\r\nadditional two ounces.[686]\r\n\r\n[686] _Rep. P. G._, 1885, p. 14; 1898, pp. 1-2.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in postage for inland matter was accompanied by lower rates\r\nfor colonial and foreign letters. Although the proposal of the Marquis\r\nof Clanricarde to establish a definite shilling[687] rate for all\r\ncolonial letters was not immediately adopted, it was not long before\r\neven lower rates were accepted. The Marquis' plan was communicated to\r\nthe Treasury Lords in 1850 purely on Imperial grounds, \"to strengthen\r\nthe ties between the colonies and the mother country.\" Rates other than\r\nthose on letters were even then far from excessive. Newspapers, for\r\ninstance, often passed free or they were charged a penny each either in\r\nEngland or the colony, but not in both. Parliamentary proceedings paid\r\nbut one penny, sometimes 2_d._ per quarter-pound, books 6_d._ per\r\nhalf-pound. A few years later a 6_d._ letter rate was adopted for all\r\nparts of the Empire except India, the Cape, Mauritius, and Van Diemen's\r\nLand. In 1857 the 6_d._ rate per half-ounce was extended to all the\r\ncolonies and in 1868 to the United States. In the following year this\r\nrate was lowered to 3_d._ for letters to the United States, Canada and\r\nPrince Edward Island.[688] In 1890 this rate in the case of most of the\r\ncolonies, and some foreign countries, was still further reduced to\r\n2-1/2_d._, partly no doubt on account of the crusade which Mr. Heaton\r\nhad undertaken for penny postage within the Empire.[689] In 1898 his\r\npenny aspirations were realized for all the important colonies with the\r\nexception of the Australasian and South African, and in 1905 these too\r\nfell into line and were joined by Egypt and the Soudan.[690] In 1907,\r\nthe experiment was tried of charging the comparatively nominal sum of\r\none penny a pound on British newspapers, magazines, and trade journals\r\nfor Canada, duly registered for the purpose, when sent by direct\r\nCanadian packet. This rate is less than the cost but the loss is\r\ndiminished by the fact that the Dominion Government relieves the British\r\nPost Office of the whole cost of ocean transit by the Canadian\r\nsubsidized lines.[691]\r\n\r\n[687] Even at this time (1850) the shilling rate was the rule.\r\n\r\n[688] _Acc. & P._, 1852-53, xcv., 204, pp. 2-3; _Rep.

G._, 1907, pp. 4-5.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 arrangements were made with the principal European countries for\r\na marked reduction in letter postage rates. With France a rate of 8_d._\r\nor 10_d._ for a quarter of an ounce, according to the country in which\r\nthe postage was paid, had existed. This was reduced to 4_d._ payable in\r\neither country. With Italy and Spain the existing rates of 1_s._ 1_d._\r\nand 10_d._ respectively for a quarter of an ounce were reduced to 6_d._\r\nThe Belgian sixpenny half-ounce rate was made 4_d._, and with the German\r\nPostal Union the rate was reduced from 8_d._ to 6_d._ for a half-ounce\r\nletter. In general these were prepaid rates.[692] The first Postal Union\r\nmeeting at Berne in 1874 reduced still further the old rates and\r\nsimplified the rules for the settlement of postal payments between the\r\nsubscribing nations. A uniform rate for prepaid letters of 2-1/2_d._ the\r\nhalf ounce was agreed to, 5_d._ for an unpaid letter. Post cards were\r\ncharged at half the rate of a prepaid letter, newspapers a penny for\r\nfour ounces, printed papers (other than newspapers), books, legal and\r\ncommercial documents, and samples of merchandise a penny for two\r\nounces.[693] In 1891 the uniform letter rate existing among those\r\ncountries in Europe which were members of the Postal Union was extended,\r\nso far as the United Kingdom was concerned, to all parts of the globe.\r\nOn the first of October, 1907, a further reduction was made when the\r\nunit of weight for outward foreign and colonial letters was raised from\r\nhalf an ounce to an ounce, and the charge on foreign letters for each\r\nunit after the first was reduced from 2-1/2_d._ to 1-1/2_d._[694]\r\n\r\n[692] _Ibid._, 1864, p. 21; 1859, pp. 19-20.\r\n\r\n[693] _Ibid._, 1875, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[694] _Ibid._, 1892, p. 8; 1906, pp. 1-2.\r\n\r\nShortly after acquiring the money order business from the managing\r\nproprietors, the Post Office reduced the rates of commission to 3_d._\r\nfor orders not exceeding £2 in value, and 6_d._ for orders above £2 but\r\nnot over £5, the latter sum being at that time the maximum. In 1862 the\r\nissue of orders for larger sums was allowed at the following rates:\r\n9_d._ when not in excess of £7, and 12_d._ between £7 and £10. On the\r\nfirst day of May, 1871, a further reduction was made and the following\r\nscale of charges announced: for sums under 10_s._, a penny; between\r\n10_s._ and £1, 2_d._; between £1 and £2, 3_d._, and an additional penny\r\nfor each additional pound to the £10 limit. It was found, however, that\r\nthe low rate of a penny for small orders did not pay, and a decision was\r\nreached to raise the rate for these small orders and provide a cheaper\r\nmeans for their remittance by post. In pursuance of this policy the rate\r\nfor orders under 10_s._ was increased to 2_d._, for orders between\r\n10_s._ and £1 to 3_d._, and in 1881 the following rates were announced\r\nfor postal notes: a halfpenny for notes of the value of 1_s._ and 1_s._\r\n6_d._; a penny for notes of the value of 2_s._ 6_d._, 5_s._ and 7_s._,\r\n6_d._ and 2_d._ for notes costing 10_s._, 12_s._ 6_d._, 15_s._, 17_s._\r\n6_d._, and 20_s._ In 1884 a new series of postal orders was issued, the\r\n12_s._ 6_d._ and 17_s._ 6_d._ notes being dropped and new notes issued\r\nof the value of 2_s._, 3_s._, 3_s._ 6_d._, 4_s._, 4_s._ 6_d._, 10_s._\r\n6_d._ for a penny each and the rate on the 15_s._ and 20_s._ notes was\r\nreduced to 1-1/2_d._ In 1903 still others were introduced with the\r\nresult that a postal order may now be obtained for every complete 6_d._\r\nfrom 6_d._ to 20_s._ and for 21_s._ and broken sums to the value of\r\n5_d._ may be made up by affixing postage stamps. Finally, in 1905, the\r\npoundage on postal notes for 2_s._ and 2_s._ 6_d._ was reduced from\r\n1_d._ to a halfpenny, and on postal orders for 11_s._ to 15_s._\r\ninclusive from 1-1/2_d._ to 1_d._ In 1886 the money order rates were\r\nreduced as follows:--\r\n                                _d._\r\n  On sums not exceeding £1       2\r\n                        £2       3\r\n                        £4       4\r\n                        £7       5\r\n                       £10       6\r\n\r\nThese rates were in their turn altered as follows on February 1, 1897:--\r\n                                  _d._\r\n  For an order not exceeding £3    3\r\n  Over £3 but not exceeding £10    4\r\n\r\nUpon the representation of the Friendly Societies, which send a good\r\nmany small orders, these rates were changed in May of the same year to\r\nthe following:--\r\n                                             _d._\r\n\r\n  For an order not exceeding £1               2\r\n               exceeding £1 but not over £3   3\r\n               exceeding £3 but not over £10  4\r\n\r\nAnd finally in 1903 the maximum amount of a money order was raised from\r\n£10 to £40 and the following rates established:[695]--\r\n                                           _d._\r\n  For sums not exceeding £1                 2\r\n  For sums above £1 but not exceeding £3    3\r\n                 £3                   £10   4\r\n                 £10                  £20   6\r\n                 £20                  £30   8\r\n                 £30                  £40  10\r\n\r\nIn addition to the reductions in rates which have been outlined above,\r\nother changes have been made which have resulted in certain cases in a\r\nsaving to the transmitter of a money order. The charge for correcting or\r\naltering the name of the remitter or payee of an inland order has been\r\nreduced to the fixed sum of a penny. The fee payable for stopping\r\npayment of an inland order was fixed at 4_d._, and this was made to\r\ncover the issue of a new order if the request was made at the time of\r\nstopping payment. A penny stamp need no longer be affixed to a money\r\norder when payment is deferred and payment may be deferred for any\r\nperiod not exceeding ten days.[696]\r\n\r\n[695] _Rep. P.

The limit imposed was £10, the rates being\r\n                                _d._\r\n  On orders not exceeding £1     4\r\n                          £2     6\r\n                          £4     8\r\n                          £7    10\r\n                          £10   12\r\n\r\nThere was an additional charge of at least 9_d._ for the official\r\ntelegram, authorizing payment, which was sent in duplicate. When several\r\norders were sent at the same time and the total amount did not exceed\r\n£50, only one official telegram was sent and paid for. The above rates\r\nwere lowered in 1897 to 4_d._ for sums not in excess of £3, and 6_d._\r\nfor sums from £3 to £10 with a minimum charge of 6_d._ for the official\r\ntelegram of advice.[697] At the present time inland telegraph money\r\norders may be issued for the same amounts as ordinary inland money\r\norders and at the same rates, plus a fee of 2_d._ and the cost of the\r\nofficial telegram.\r\n\r\n[697] _Rep. P. G._, 1896, pp. 30-32.\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War, the Army Post Office was authorized to issue\r\nmoney orders at inland rates and the system was extended to Gibraltar\r\nand Malta. In 1858 a proposition advanced by Canada for the interchange\r\nof money orders was favourably received by the Home Government, and in\r\nthe following year provision was made for their issue between the United\r\nKingdom and Canada at four times the inland rates, to a limit of £5. In\r\n1862 the system was extended to all the colonies, the rates being the\r\nsame as those already agreed upon with Canada except in the case of\r\nGibraltar and Malta where they were three times the inland rates, and\r\nthe maximum was increased to £10. In 1868 a money order convention was\r\nconcluded with Switzerland, the rates being the same as those for inland\r\norders, and in 1869 a similar agreement was made with Belgium, but in\r\n1871 the rates for both countries were increased to three times the\r\ninland rates upon the same terms as those prevailing with other parts of\r\nEurope. In 1880 colonial rates were reduced to the same level, and in\r\n1883 the following changes were adopted:\r\n                                _d._\r\n  On orders not exceeding £2     6\r\n                          £5    12\r\n                          £7    18\r\n                          £10   24\r\n\r\nThese were superseded in 1896 by the following rates:--\r\n                               _d._\r\n  On orders not exceeding £2    6\r\n                          £6    12\r\n                          £10   18\r\n\r\nBy 1903 most foreign countries and some of the colonies had agreed to a\r\nfurther reduction of rates and to a £40 limit. In 1905 the poundage on\r\nforeign money orders not exceeding £1 in value was diminished from 4_d._\r\nto 3_d._[698]\r\n\r\n[698] _Rep. P.

The postmen remained unpaid for years at a time.\r\nAfter sufficient clamour, part of the arrears would be met, but it is\r\nimpossible to say how much of the sum paid was for current expenses and\r\nhow much for old debts.[701] It might be supposed from the fact that\r\nthey received fixed daily wages that some idea might be obtained of the\r\ncost of management. But their wages often remained unpaid and the number\r\nof postmen varied, as new routes were manned or old routes discontinued,\r\nso that any figures for the period before the seventeenth century would\r\nbe mere guesses.\r\n\r\n[699] _Rep.

In 1603, the cost of the posts was £4150 a year.[703]\r\nThis was the year of James the First's accession, and to this is\r\nprobably due the fact that payment was made for an entire year. Then\r\nthere comes a break of several years' duration. In 1621, arrears for the\r\nhalf year ending March 31, 1619, were paid. They amounted to £917. For\r\nthe next two years the yearly expenses averaged £2984. The total\r\nexpenses for the financial year ending in March, 1621, were £3404. All\r\nthe posts to Berwick received 92_s._ a day, to Dover 17_s._ 6_d._, to\r\nHolyhead 36_s._ 8_d._ and £130 a year for a sailing packet, to Plymouth\r\n25_s._ a day. The wages for each postmaster varied from 1_s._ 8_d._ to\r\n4_s._ 4_d._ a day. In addition there was an expenditure of £50 for\r\nextraordinary posts and 5_s._ a day to the paymaster.[704] In 1625, the\r\nordinary expenses were about £4300 a year.[705] It is disappointing not\r\nto be able to make any more definite statements concerning the financial\r\noperations of the Post Office before 1635, but the unbusinesslike system\r\nunder which it was conducted must take the blame.\r\n\r\n[702] The proceeds from de Quester's rates, which went into effect from\r\nthis year, may possibly have gone to the Post Office. After Witherings'\r\nrates were announced in 1635, they certainly did.\r\n\r\n[703] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1603-10, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[704] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, app., p. 43 (21).\r\n\r\n[705] Hist. MSS. Com., _Rep._, 12, app., pt. 4, p. 472.\r\n\r\nOur ideas of the financial operations of the Post Office from 1635 to\r\n1711 are somewhat clearer than during the preceding period. We know that\r\nWitherings' aim was to make the system self-supporting. It had probably\r\nnot entered into his head that it might ever be anything more. After the\r\nsequestration of the position of Postmaster-General to Burlamachi, he\r\nwas called upon to render an account of the financial proceedings of the\r\nPost Office during the short period that he was in charge.[706] He\r\nreported that from August 4, 1640, to December 25, 1641, the receipts\r\nhad been £8363 and the expenditure £4867. £1400 of the balance had been\r\npaid to the Secretary of State and \"of the remaining £2000, those that\r\nkeep the office are to be considered for their pains and attendance.\"\r\nThis is rather vague but the report shows that the Post Office was\r\nself-supporting only six years after Witherings' reforms had been\r\nadopted.[707] Prideaux reported at an early period in his régime that,\r\nwith the exception of the Dover road and the Holyhead packet, the posts\r\npaid for themselves.[708] After the Post Office was farmed, there can be\r\nno doubt as to the total net revenue, but it is impossible to say how\r\nmuch the farmer made over and above the amount of his farm or how large\r\nhis expenses were. Manley paid the state £10,000 a year and is said to\r\nhave made £14,000 during the six years that he farmed the Posts.[709] In\r\n1659 the rent was raised to £14,000[710] a year, and in 1660 there was a\r\nfurther advance to £21,500.[711] Of this £21,500 the Duke of York\r\nreceived £16,117 and the rest was spent largely in paying pensions and\r\nfor a few minor expenses such as the payment of the Court\r\nPostmaster.[712] By the act of 1663, the net Post Office revenue was\r\nsettled upon the Duke of York and his male heirs, with the exception of\r\nabout £5000 a year, that being the amount of the pension charges on the\r\nrevenue.[713] Certain deductions were made from the sum total of rent\r\ndue, on account of the loss to the farmer from the activity of the\r\ninterlopers, and the deficit was ordered to be made up from some other\r\nbranch of the royal revenue.[714]\r\n\r\n[706] _Cal.

In 1690, an act of\r\nParliament was passed, making the receipts from the Post Office payable\r\ninto the Exchequer. They were to be used among other things to pay the\r\ninterest on £250,000 borrowed to carry on the war.[715] From 1690 to\r\n1710, the gross receipts rose from about £70,000 to £90,000 a year, no\r\nconsideration being taken of the ups and downs caused by the French\r\nwars.[716] Complaint was made by the Lords that a large part of the\r\npostal revenue was wasted in paying pensions.[717] The Duchess of\r\nCleveland received £4700 a year and William's Dutch General, the Duke of\r\nSchomberg, £4000 a year. Poor William Dockwra, the only one of the lot\r\nwho had ever done anything for the Post Office, was at the end of the\r\nlist with only £500 a year, terminable in 1697.[718] The sum total of\r\nmoney payable in pensions from the post revenue in 1695 was £21,200. The\r\npacket boats at the same time cost £13,000, and but £10,000 was spent\r\nfor salaries and wages. The net revenue in 1694 was £59,972, the gross\r\nbeing about £88,000.[719]\r\n\r\n[715] Hist.

The House of Commons replied that they very\r\nmuch regretted that they could not do so for the Post Office was\r\nalready paying too much in pensions. Probably the real reason for their\r\nrefusal was the fact that the Duke and the war party were becoming\r\nunpopular. However, the Queen granted him the pension for her own life\r\nas she had a legal right to do. In 1713, the total amount of pensions\r\npayable from the postal revenue was £22,120. Before the act of 1711 was\r\npassed, the Scotch Office had paid £210 to each of the Universities of\r\nEdinburgh and Glasgow. This continued to be granted after the two\r\nOffices were united.[720]\r\n\r\n[720] _Cal. T. P._, 1708-14, p. 20.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the financial operations of the Post Office during the\r\neighteenth century is much more extensive than during the seventeenth,\r\nowing to the reports made by the Post Office officials to the\r\nParliamentary committees, appointed to enquire into abuses. The reports\r\nare all signed by the Accountant-General or his deputy, and are\r\ntherefore as trustworthy as anything which can be obtained. They show\r\nthat during the first half of the century, or more explicitly from 1717\r\nto 1754, there was a very small annual increase in gross product, with\r\nan actual decrease in net product, and of course an increase in\r\nexpenditure. In round numbers the average yearly gross product for the\r\nyears 1725-29 was £179,000, the net product for the same period being\r\n£98,000 and the expenses of management £81,000. For the five years from\r\n1750 to 1754, the average annual gross product was £207,000, net product\r\n£97,000, and expenses £110,000. It is not surprising that there was no\r\nincrease worthy of the name in the gross product, for the period under\r\nconsideration was a time of stagnation, an intermediate stage just\r\nbefore the dawn of the industrial revolution. The actual decrease in net\r\nproduct or, what amounts to the same thing, the increase in expenses of\r\nmanagement, is due largely to the abuse of the franking privilege, the\r\nlarge amounts received in fees and emoluments, the extraordinary way in\r\nwhich the packet service was mismanaged, and the losses and increased\r\nexpense due to war. Enough has been said about all but the last of these\r\ncauses. The Post Office suffered most during war from increased expenses\r\nand direct losses in connection with the sailing packets. The placing of\r\nthese upon a war footing involved considerable increased cost. In the\r\nsecond place, extra boats were used for political purposes in addition\r\nto those regularly employed, and it was customary for the Post Office to\r\nmake good to the owners all damages inflicted by the enemy. From 1725 to\r\n1739, the expenses of the Post Office averaged £80,000 or £90,000 a\r\nyear. Then came the War of the Austrian Succession, when the expenses\r\naveraged £105,000 per year from 1745 to 1749. The five following years\r\nbeing a period of peace, the average annual expenses were £110,000,\r\nwhile the Seven Years' War brought them up to £147,000. It may be\r\nthought that expenses should become normal again when war has ceased,\r\nbut it has generally proved to be the rule that although peace brings a\r\ndecrease, yet the expenditure does not fall quite so low as before the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nFrom 1755 to the end of the century there is a marked rise both in gross\r\nand net receipts and a comparative diminution in expenses. The gross\r\naverage annual product from 1755 to 1759 was £228,000, from 1790 to 1794\r\nit was £602,000. For the five years from 1755 to 1759 the average yearly\r\nnet product was £81,000, from 1790 to 1794 it was £375,000, while\r\nexpenses had risen for the same periods only from £147,000 to £227,000.\r\nThe following table shows the average yearly increase or decrease in\r\ngross product, expenses, and net products for the six five-year periods\r\nfrom 1765 to 1794. The increases or decreases are given in the form of\r\npercentages, each five-year period being compared with the preceding\r\nperiod.[721]\r\n\r\n            _Gross product_       _Expenses_       _Net product_\r\n 1765-69      17% increase        22% decrease      76% increase\r\n 1770-74      11     \"            27  increase      unchanged\r\n 1775-79      12     \"            30     \"               \"\r\n 1780-84      19     \"            37     \"               \"\r\n 1785-89[722] 21     \"            21  decrease      90% increase\r\n 1790-94      24     \"            14  increase      30%    \"\r\n\r\n[721] For the gross product, net product, and expenses for each year,\r\nsee Appendix, pp. 243, 244, 245, Tables I, II.\r\n\r\n[722] Rates were increased in 1784.\r\n\r\nThe net product from both the Scotch and Irish Posts was remitted to\r\nEngland. These receipts did not amount to much as compared with those\r\nfrom the English Post. Earl Temple, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in\r\nwriting to Grenville in 1784, said that the Irish post \"had never paid\r\n£8000 a year clear of expenses.\"[723] In 1796, the gross product was\r\n£26,949 and the expenses of management £8718. Of the net product, £6651\r\nwere retained, being placed to the credit of Great Britain for returned\r\nand missent letters and for the £4000 which the Irish Post was entitled\r\nto receive in lieu of the receipts from the Holyhead packet boats. The\r\nremaining £11,579 were sent to the general Post Office. The Scotch Posts\r\ndid considerably better. The gross product in 1796 was £69,338, the\r\nexpenses of management £14,346, for returned letters £1206, and the net\r\nproduct sent to the General Office was £54,265.\r\n\r\n[723] Hist. MSS. Com., _Dropmore_, i, p. 179.\r\n\r\nThe time had long since passed when the London-Dover road was the most\r\nimportant in the kingdom and when the receipts from foreign exceeded\r\nthose from inland letters. As late as 1653, when contracts were called\r\nfor from those wishing to farm the posts, the amount offered in one\r\ninstance was almost as great for the foreign as for the inland post. The\r\naverage annual gross product from the foreign post for the period\r\n1785-89 was £61,431, the expenses £32,169 and the net product £29,262.\r\nFor the period from 1790 to 1794 there was a small increase to £65,497\r\nfor gross product, £34,277 for expenses, and £31,200 for net\r\nproduct.[724]\r\n\r\n[724] _Parl.

Com._, ii, 222, p. 93.\r\n\r\nThe receipts from the London Penny Post were never an important factor\r\nin postal finance but it had always paid for itself and given a\r\nreasonable surplus. Its importance was due more to its social value in\r\naffording a cheaper letter rate and a speedier postal service than the\r\nGeneral Post. The average yearly gross product from 1785-94 was £10,508,\r\nexpenses £5177, and net product £5331. After Johnson had improved it so\r\nmuch, it produced a yearly average gross product from 1795 to 1797 of\r\n£26,283. Expenses averaged £18,960 and net product £7323.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the receipts from bye and cross post letters\r\namounted to very little. So little was expected from them that no\r\nprovision was made for checking the postage on them. It was taken for\r\ngranted that all letters would pass to, from, or through London. In 1720\r\nthey brought in only £3700. Allen had done much to increase the\r\nrevenue, but it was not until the last part of the eighteenth century\r\nthat the increase was at all marked. From 1780 to 1784, the average\r\nannual gross product was £77,911, expenses £12,346 and net product\r\n£65,565. From 1785 to 1789, these had increased respectively to\r\n£104,817, £11,589, and £93,228, and from 1790 to 1794 to £140,974,\r\n£15,030, and £125,944. The small expense for these letters is explained\r\nby the fact that the separate department for bye and cross post letters\r\nwas debited with only a portion of the total cost, the larger part being\r\ncarried by the general establishment.[725]\r\n\r\n[725] _Parl. Papers_, 1812-13, _Rep. Com._, ii, 222, p. 91.\r\n\r\nThe financial history of the Post Office from the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century to 1838 is a rather depressing record.[726] From 1805\r\nuntil 1820 both the gross and net receipts had increased steadily\r\nalthough not rapidly, but for the remainder of the period the revenue\r\nwas practically stationary. During the five-year periods, 1820-24 and\r\n1830-34, there had been a decrease in gross receipts, and during the\r\nlatter of these periods the net receipts had been kept a little ahead of\r\nthe five-year period 1815-19 only by a decrease in expenditure.\r\n\r\n[726] See Appendix, p. 246, Table III; p. 247, Table IV.\r\n\r\nThe annual gross receipts from Scotland had increased from £117,108\r\nduring the period 1800-04 to £204,481 during the period 1830-34, the\r\nannual net receipts for the same periods being £98,156 and £149,752. The\r\nrelatively large increase in expenses from £18,952 to £54,729 had been\r\ndue largely to the payment of mail coach tolls after 1814, amounting to\r\nsomething under £20,000 a year.[727] Ireland started with a smaller\r\ngross revenue, £92,745 a year during the period 1800-04, but a larger\r\nannual expenditure £64,368,[728] and comparatively small net receipts of\r\n£28,377. Gross receipts, expenses, and net receipts had increased slowly\r\nthroughout the first thirty-four years of the nineteenth century with\r\nthe exception of the period 1820-24. For the five years from 1830 to\r\n1834 inclusive they amounted to £244,098, £108,898, and £135,200\r\nrespectively.[729]\r\n\r\n[727] See Appendix, p. 248, Table V.\r\n\r\n[728] Ireland had paid for mail coach tolls from the first and this\r\npartly explains the relatively high expenditure.\r\n\r\n[729] See Appendix, p. 248, Table V.\r\n\r\nThe increases in rates in 1801, 1805, and 1812 had not produced the\r\ndesired and expected results. The increase in 1801 had been estimated to\r\nproduce £150,000 but results showed that this estimate was too large by\r\n£35,000. In 1805, the additional penny had resulted in an increase of\r\nonly £136,000, inclusive of any natural increase of revenue, although it\r\nhad been estimated to produce £230,000. The third increase in rates in\r\n1812 proved even less productive. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said\r\nthat he expected it to produce £200,000. As a matter of fact the revenue\r\nincreased only £77,892 in amount. The fact of the matter was that rates\r\nwere already so high that an increase only led to greater efforts to\r\nevade the payment of postage. As a system of taxation the Post Office\r\nhad become rigid. It could yield no more with postage as high as it had\r\nbeen forced by the acts of 1801 and 1805. But, considered primarily as a\r\ntaxing medium, and it had been considered as such for 200 years, it\r\ncould hardly be called a failure. We flatter ourselves that our idea of\r\nthe Post Office is broader in its scope and more utilitarian in its\r\nobject but we have the good fortune to live several generations after\r\n1840. What England demanded was revenue and still more revenue, and a\r\npostal system which could produce £70 net for every £100 collected had\r\nsome excuse for its existence.\r\n\r\nRowland Hill has pointed out that from 1815 to 1835 the population had\r\nincreased from 19,552,000 to 25,605,000 while the net revenue from the\r\nPost Office had remained practically stationary. He said nothing,\r\nhowever, about the industrial depression of the country during that\r\nperiod nor of the political and economic crisis through which England\r\nwas passing. He referred to the great increase in the postal revenue of\r\nthe United States during the same period; on the one hand, a nation with\r\nimmense natural resources and a population doubling itself every\r\ngeneration, and on the other hand, a people inhabiting two small\r\nislands, making heroic efforts to recover from a most burdensome war.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of penny postage the gross revenue of the Post\r\nOffice fell from £2,390,763 in 1840 to £1,359,466 in 1841, and did not\r\nfully recover from the decreased postage rates for twelve years. The\r\ncost of management, on the other hand, increased only from £756,999 in\r\n1840 to £858,677 in 1841. But the financial loss is shown most plainly\r\nin the falling off in net revenue from £1,633,764 to £500,789. If we\r\nexclude packet expenses, and such was the practice until 1858, the net\r\nrevenue did not again reach the maximum figure of high postage days\r\nuntil 1862. Including packet expenses we find that the net revenue did\r\nnot fully recover until the early seventies. The average yearly gross\r\nrevenue for the period from 1841-45 was £1,658,214, expenditure\r\n£1,001,405, and the net revenue £656,809. These all increased steadily\r\nand on the whole proportionately until 1860, the average yearly figures\r\nfor the preceding five years being £3,135,587, £1,785,911, and\r\n£1,349,676. In 1858 the packet expenses are included under cost of\r\nmanagement and their enormous increase from the beginning of the century\r\nsadly depleted the net revenue. It seems more advisable, however, not to\r\ninclude them until 1860 when the packets passed from the control of the\r\nAdmiralty to that of the Post Office. The average gross revenue for the\r\nyears 1861 to 1865 was £4,016,750, expenditure (including packets)\r\n£3,013,389, and net revenue £1,003,341. During the next quarter of a\r\ncentury these increased to £6,326,141, £4,019,423, and £2,306,718\r\nrespectively, exclusive of telegraph receipts and expenditures. For the\r\nfive years ending 31st March, 1906, the average gross revenue was\r\n£15,926,905, expenditure £11,156,292, and net revenue £4,770,613.[730]\r\n\r\n[730] See Appendix, pp. 249, 250, 251, Table VI; p. 252, Table VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF MONOPOLY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the state's monopoly and the opposing efforts of the\r\ninterlopers to break this monopoly resolves itself into a consideration\r\nof the way in which private letters were carried, for the public letters\r\nwere entirely at the disposal of the state to be dealt with as it saw\r\nfit. From the sixteenth century there were several ways in which private\r\nletters might be conveyed. Within the kingdom they might be sent by the\r\ncommon carriers, friends, special messengers, or the Royal Posts.\r\nLetters sent abroad were carried by the Royal Posts, the Merchant\r\nAdventurers' Posts, the Strangers' Posts, and the Merchants' Posts while\r\nthey lasted. The fact that private letters were conveyed by the Royal\r\nPosts is generally expressed in rather indefinite terms or by references\r\nto proclamations, but that they were actually so conveyed is entirely\r\nbeyond doubt.[731] In 1585 a certain Mr. Lewkenor informed Walsingham\r\nthat the post just landed had brought many letters directed to\r\nmerchants, besides those for the Court and Government. He asked whether\r\nhe might open those letters which were directed to suspected\r\nmerchants.[732] This reference is of course to letters coming from\r\nabroad. The same holds true of inland letters, for in 1583 Randolph, the\r\nPostmaster-General, wrote to Walsingham, enclosing the names of those\r\n\"who charge the posts with their private letters and commissions at a\r\npenny the mile.\"[733]\r\n\r\n[731] G. Roberts, _Social History of the Southern Counties of England_,\r\n1856, p. 508; Joyce, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[732] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1581-90, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[733] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1581-90, p. 228; 1598-1601, p. 427; _Rep. Com._,\r\n1844, xiv, 601, p. 4.\r\n\r\nIn 1591 the first proclamation affirming the government monopoly in the\r\nforeign posts was issued. All persons except the Postmaster-General and\r\nhis deputies were forbidden \"directly or indirectly to gather up,\r\nreceive, bring in or carry out of this realm any letters or packets,\"\r\nthe only exceptions being in the case of the despatches of the\r\nprincipal Secretaries of State, of Ambassadors, and others sufficiently\r\nauthorized. An appendix to the same proclamation commanded all mayors,\r\nbailiffs, sheriffs, justices, etc., and especially all searchers to be\r\non the watch for men coming into or going out of the realm with packets\r\nor letters. In this last part of the proclamation we can see why it was\r\nthought necessary to restrict the carriage of letters to and from\r\nforeign countries to the Royal Posts. It was done that the Government\r\nmight be able to discover any treasonable or seditious correspondence.\r\nThis did not always remain the object of the state in restricting\r\ncompetition but was succeeded later by other and different motives. In\r\norder that there might be no doubt about the whole question, the\r\nPostmaster-General received word from the Council to inform the London\r\nmerchants, foreigners as well as British subjects and all others whom it\r\nmight concern, that they should no longer employ any others to carry\r\ntheir letters than those legally appointed in accordance with the terms\r\nof the proclamation.[734]\r\n\r\n[734] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, 601, p. 4; app., p. 36 (14).\r\n\r\nIn 1602 the first order concerning the despatch of private letters\r\nwithin the kingdom was issued to the Royal Posts. \"The Posts for the\r\nQueen's immediate service\"[735] were allowed to carry only state\r\ndespatches, directed by members of the council, the Postmaster-General\r\nand certain officials. Such despatches when sent by the regular posts\r\nwere to be forwarded immediately. The letters of all other persons\r\nallowed to write by post must wait for the regular departure of the\r\npostmen. In the orders to the posts issued in 1609, the first article\r\nreads as follows: \"No pacquets or letters shall be sent by the Posts or\r\nbind any Post to ride therewith but those on Our special affairs.\"[736]\r\nThe first part of this is certainly strong but it is modified by the\r\nsucceeding clause \"nor bind any Post to ride therewith.\" Evidently he\r\nmight if he wished, and he would probably hesitate longer over a state\r\npacket for the conveyance of which he was never assured of anything than\r\nover a private letter for which he was certain of his pay.\r\n\r\n[735] By \"Posts for the Queen's immediate service\" was probably meant\r\nthe special messengers attached to the Court.\r\n\r\n[736] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1547-65, pp. 215-77; _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, 601,\r\napp., p. 42 (20).\r\n\r\nIt was the custom after 1609 to follow the appointment of every new\r\nPostmaster-General with a proclamation assigning him and his deputies\r\nthe sole privilege of carrying all letters and reading anathema upon all\r\ninterlopers.[737] Thus King James favoured Stanhope, his\r\nPostmaster-General, with a grant of monopoly.[738] On de Quester's\r\nappointment as Foreign Postmaster-General a proclamation was issued,\r\nforbidding any but his agents from having anything to do with foreign\r\nletters.[739] In spite of the improvements which he inaugurated, we find\r\nhim asking the King a few years later to renew his patent of monopoly\r\nand his request was granted.[740] He was evidently suffering from\r\ncompetition. But the Merchant Adventurers' Posts were not yet dead and\r\ntheir Postmaster, Billingsley, abetted by the House of Commons,[741]\r\ngave de Quester so much trouble that he was imprisoned by the Council's\r\norder.[742]\r\n\r\n[737] Letters carried by a friend or special messenger or a common\r\ncarrier were excepted.\r\n\r\n[738] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, 601, app., p. 42 (20).\r\n\r\n[739] _Ibid._, 1591-94, p. 401.\r\n\r\n[740] _Ibid._, 1627-28, pp. 511-22.\r\n\r\n[741] The House had already shown its interest in postal affairs by\r\nsummoning postmasters before the Committee of Grievances in 1624 (_Jo.\r\nH. C._, 1547-1628, pp. 689-774).\r\n\r\n[742] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1628-29, p. 177.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the postmen on the London-Plymouth road had petitioned\r\nthe Council that they alone should carry the letters and despatches of\r\nthe merchants over their road. They said they had so improved the\r\nservice between London and Plymouth that letters were now despatched\r\nbetween the two cities in three days and an answer might be received\r\nwithin one week from the time of first writing. Their complaint was\r\nagainst a certain Samuel Jude, who had undertaken the conveyance of the\r\nLondon merchants' letters. Jude himself acknowledged this, but said that\r\nhe had never meddled with the \"through\" post by which he meant the\r\ntravellers' post.[743]\r\n\r\n[743] _Ibid._, 1625-49, p. 367; 1629-31, p. 200.\r\n\r\nSo long as the Royal Posts did not give satisfaction, competition was\r\ninevitable. Under Witherings they had improved so much that what\r\ncompetition there was, received no support from the London merchants. In\r\n1633 they addressed a petition to the King, praying that he would\r\nprotect Witherings from some strangers in London, who had set up posts\r\nof their own. They pointed out how he, acting with some foreign\r\npostmasters, had set up packet posts, travelling day and night. By means\r\nof these, letters were conveyed between London and Antwerp in three\r\ndays, while the messengers needed from eight to fourteen days to travel\r\nthe same distance.[744] The common carriers were giving trouble in the\r\ndespatch of inland letters at the same time that competition in the\r\nforeign posts was attracting attention.[745] It was their custom to send\r\ntheir carts on ahead while they lingered to collect letters. After the\r\ncollection they hastened on, leaving their carts behind, and delivered\r\nthe letters on the way. It was provided that no carrier should stay\r\nlonger than eight hours in a place after his cart had left it, or arrive\r\nin any place eight hours ahead of it.[746] As long as their speed was\r\ngoverned by that of their lumbering carts over the wretched roads, no\r\nfear was felt that their competition would prove troublesome.\r\n\r\n[744] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1633-34, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[745] _Ibid._, 1637-38, pp. 22, 171, 177, 183.\r\n\r\n[746] _Ibid._, 1637-38, p. 193; _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, 601, app., p. 58\r\n(37).\r\n\r\nWith the growing strength of Parliament, more and more opposition was\r\nmade to the grants of monopoly and their enforcement. In 1642 the House\r\nof Commons passed a resolution \"affirming that the taking of the letters\r\nfrom the several carriers and the several restraints and imprisonments\r\nof Grover, Chapman, Cotton, and Mackerill are against the law.\" The\r\nHouse proceeded to state that these several persons should have\r\nreparation and damages from Coke, Windebank, and Witherings.[747] Four\r\nyears later a report was made by Justices Pheasant and Rolls on\r\nWitherings' patent.[748] They held that the clause of restraint in the\r\ngrant to Witherings was void.[749] This decision was quite in accordance\r\nwith the views of Parliament when they opposed the King and all his\r\nworks. But after Parliament had obtained control of the Posts, \"the\r\nPresident and Governors of the Poor of the City of London\" proposed to\r\nthe Common Council that the City should establish a postal system in\r\norder to raise money for the relief of the poor in London. A committee\r\nwas appointed to inform Warwick, Prideaux, and Witherings of their\r\nintention. At the same time an attempt to lay a petition before\r\nParliament on the question failed. Counsel's advice was sought and\r\nobtained in favour of the undertaking and in 1650 the Committee received\r\norders to settle the stages. At the end of six weeks they had\r\nestablished postal communications with Scotland and other places.\r\nComplaint was made to Parliament, and the Commons passed a resolution\r\n\"that the office of Postmaster, inland and foreign, is and ought to be\r\nin the sole power and disposal of the Parliament.\" The same year the\r\ncity posts were suppressed.[750]\r\n\r\n[747] _Jo. H. C._, 1640-42, p. 722.\r\n\r\n[748] These were the same judges who had decided in favour of Stanhope's\r\npatent in Stanhope _v._ Witherings.\r\n\r\n[749] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, 601, app., p. 67 (42).\r\n\r\n[750] Chas. Knight, _London_, 1842, iii, p. 276; R. R. Sharpe, _London\r\nand the Kingdom_, 1894, pp. 322-23.\r\n\r\nOxenbridge and his friends who had set up posts of their own gave\r\nPrideaux and Manley the hardest fight that any Postmaster-General ever\r\nhad to encounter from interlopers. Joyce says that Oxenbridge had acted\r\nas Prideaux' deputy.[751] If this is so, he was soon up in arms against\r\nhis superior. In accordance with the judicial decision that the clause\r\nin Witherings' patent giving him a monopoly of the carriage of letters\r\nwas void, Oxenbridge, Blackwall, Thomson, and Malyn had undertaken the\r\nprivate conveyance of letters and had set up posts of their own.\r\nPrideaux had charged 6_d._ for each letter and had organized weekly\r\nposts from and to London. Oxenbridge charged only 3_d._ and his posts\r\nwent from and to London three times a week. Prideaux then did the same\r\nand set up posters announcing that the interlopers' posts would be\r\nstopped. His agents assaulted Oxenbridge's servants and killed one of\r\nthem. He also stopped his rival's mails on Sundays but allowed his own\r\nto proceed as on other days. In addition to his regular tri-weekly\r\nmails, Oxenbridge provided packet boats for Ireland and intended to\r\nsettle stages between London and Yarmouth and the other places named by\r\nthe Council of State.[752] To proceed in Oxenbridge's own words:\r\n\"Suddenly contracts were called for. We offered £9100 a year through Ben\r\nAndrews, £800 more than was offered by Manley, yet Colonel Rich allowed\r\nManley to take advantage of an offer made by Kendall then absent and not\r\nprivy to it for £10,000 a year. Consideration had been offered by\r\nCouncil, but Manley had broken into our offices, taken letters, and had\r\nforbidden us from having anything to do with the post.\" An order of the\r\nCouncil of State, bearing the same date as the grant to Manley, was sent\r\nto Oxenbridge and his friends, informing them that Manley had been given\r\nthe sole right to the inland and foreign letter offices.[753] This did\r\nnot end the controversy, for six months later we find Oxenbridge and\r\nThomson complaining that a monopoly in carrying letters had been given\r\nto Manley. They claimed that all who wished should be allowed to carry\r\nletters at the ordinary rates.[754]\r\n\r\n[751] Joyce, p. 29.\r\n\r\n[752] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1653-54, pp. 22-24, 372. See p. 33, note.\r\n\r\n[753] _Cal. S. P. D._, 1652-53, p. 456.\r\n\r\n[754] _Ibid._, 1653-54, p. 372.\r\n\r\nOf all the interlopers up to the middle of the seventeenth century,\r\nOxenbridge had proved himself by far the ablest. From the point of view\r\nof the legal decision of 1646 and the position of Parliament before\r\n1640, his position was unassailable. With the present policy of the Post\r\nOffice in view, his actions will probably be condemned by the majority.\r\nBut in 1650 conditions were entirely different. Before 1635 the state\r\nhad either tacitly allowed the carriage of private letters to the profit\r\nof the postmen or had officially taken over such carriage; but in this\r\ncase it was largely for the purpose of keeping in touch with the plots\r\nof the times. For 200 years after 1635 the idea was to make money from\r\nthe conveyance of private letters. The effects of Oxenbridge's efforts\r\nwere certainly beneficial if we are to believe his own story. Prideaux\r\nhad been forced to cut his rates in half in order to meet competition.\r\nThe credit for this must lie with the interloper rather than with the\r\nmonopolist.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Oxenbridge was giving so much trouble, letters\r\nwere being carried by private hands in Bury, Dover, and Norwich. The\r\noffenders were summoned before the council for contempt and severely\r\nreprimanded.[755] Petitions came from Thetford and Norwich complaining\r\nthat their messenger had been summoned to present himself before the\r\nCouncil within twenty-four hours and had to travel 100 miles within that\r\ntime, an impossibility in the opinion of the petitioners.[756] As late\r\nas 1635, Prideaux, the Attorney-General, gave his opinion that\r\nParliament's monopolistic resolution of that year affected only the\r\noffice of Postmaster-General and not the carrying of letters.[757]\r\nPerhaps this was only a bit of spite on his part after Manley had\r\nsucceeded to his old position.\r\n\r\n[755] _Ibid._, 1653-54, p. 177.\r\n\r\n[756] _Ibid._, 1653-54, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[757] _Ibid._, 1652-53, pp. 109-110.\r\n\r\nThe usual monopolistic powers, hitherto granted by proclamation, were\r\nembodied in the first act of Parliament, establishing the postal system\r\nfor England, Ireland, and Scotland in 1657. The Postmaster-General was\r\ngiven the sole power to take up, carry and convey all letters and\r\npackets from and to all parts of the Commonwealth and to any place\r\nbeyond the seas where he might establish posts. He alone was to employ\r\nfoot posts, horse posts, and packet boats. Some exceptions were made to\r\nthese general rules. Letters were allowed to be conveyed by carriers so\r\nlong as they were carried in their carts or on their pack-horses. The\r\nother exceptions were in the case of letters of advice sent by merchants\r\nin their ships and proceeding no farther than the ships themselves, and\r\nalso in the case of a letter sent by a special messenger on the affairs\r\nof the sender, and in the case of a letter sent by a friend. Penalties\r\nwere attached for disobedience to this part of the act, one half of the\r\nfine to go to the informer.[758] The same provisions were enacted almost\r\nword for word in the act of 1660, with the addition that letters might\r\nbe carried by any one between any place and the nearest post road for\r\ndelivery to the postman.[759]\r\n\r\n[758] Scobell, _Collect._, pt. ii, pp. 511-13.\r\n\r\n[759] 12 Ch. II, c. 35.\r\n\r\nAfter the restoration and for some months before the act of 1660 was\r\npassed, Bishop had acted as farmer of the posts. In the absence of any\r\nlaw on the subject, the King's proclamation granting a monopoly[760] to\r\nBishop was freely disregarded.[761] Competing posts to and from London\r\nsprang up, lessening the receipts which he would otherwise have obtained\r\nfrom the carriage of letters. It was calculated that during the three\r\nmonths before these interlopers could be suppressed Bishop lost £500\r\nthrough them, and orders were given to allow him an abatement in his\r\nrent to that amount.[762]\r\n\r\n[760] _Cal.

He wished to have the privilege\r\nof horsing travellers and made an offer to the postmasters to take\r\ncharge of the post houses if they would allow him to proceed. He told\r\nthem that they should make an attempt to have their salaries restored to\r\ntheir old value by Bishop, who had raised so much from them by fines and\r\nlowering their salaries. The Postmaster-General told his deputies that\r\nif they dared to treat with the \"would-be\" interloper he would dismiss\r\nthem, and the whole thing fell through.[763] At the same time a warrant\r\nwas issued by the Council to mayors and other officials to search for\r\nand apprehend all persons carrying letters for hire, without licence\r\nfrom the Postmaster-General.[764] Nevertheless interloping did not\r\ncease, as is shown by the complaints from the postmasters.[765]\r\n\r\n[763] _Cal.

An exception was made in the case\r\nof letters carried by unauthorized persons. Such letters should be\r\nseized and sent to the Privy Council. In later proclamations it was\r\nprovided that they might be sent also to one of the Secretaries of State\r\nin order that the persons sending or conveying them might be\r\npunished.[766]\r\n\r\n[766] _Rep. Com._, 1844, xiv, 601, app., p. 88 (61).\r\n\r\nAfter Lord Arlington's appointment as Postmaster-General, he addressed a\r\npetition to the Duke of York complaining \"that carriers, proprietors of\r\nstage coaches and others take upon themselves to collect letters to an\r\nincredible number and on some stages double what the post brings.\" On\r\naccount of this he pointed out to His Royal Highness that a considerable\r\npart of his revenue was lost. This was quite true since the Post Office\r\nhad ceased to be farmed and the whole net revenue went to the Duke.[767]\r\nThis was followed the same year by a proclamation forbidding any one to\r\ncollect or carry letters without the authority of the\r\nPostmasters-General. Carriers were forbidden to convey any letters which\r\nwere not on matters relating to goods in their carts. Shipmasters must\r\ncarry no letters beyond the first stage after their arrival in England\r\nwith the exception of the letters of merchants and owners. Searchers\r\nwere appointed to see that the proclamation was enforced.[768] It was\r\neven proposed to suppress all hackney coaches, the principal reason\r\ngiven being that they decreased the value of the Duke's monopoly by\r\ncarrying multitudes of letters.[769]\r\n\r\n[767] _Cal.

The idea was much the same as that of Dockwra's\r\nalthough Povey seems to have been a far more belligerent individual than\r\nhis forerunner in the work. The Postmasters-General tried to come to\r\nsome compromise with him but he would not listen to them. Finally legal\r\naction was brought against him, based on the monopoly granted by the act\r\nof 1660. Povey lost the suit and his project fell through.[770] His was\r\nthe last attempt to organize a regular system of competing posts. During\r\nthe remainder of the eighteenth century, improvements in postal\r\ncommunications disarmed much of the former opposition. Considerable\r\ndamage was received from the superior speed with which letters might be\r\nsent by coaches but, after they were adopted by the Post Office, matters\r\nnaturally adjusted themselves. Private vessels continued to convey\r\nletters which had not paid the rates prescribed in such cases by the act\r\nof 1711, but this breach of the law was tolerated by the Post\r\nOffice.[771]\r\n\r\n[770] Knight, _London_, 1842, iii, p. 282; Joyce, pp. 121-23.\r\n\r\n[771] Joyce, p. 329.\r\n\r\nBefore the nineteenth century, opposition to the government monopoly had\r\ntaken the form of competing systems of communication, started primarily\r\nfor the sake of making money and at the same time vindicating the\r\nprinciple of competition. During the first forty years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury there was no opposition to the Post Office as a monopoly. The\r\nwidespread dissatisfaction was due to the exorbitant rates of postage\r\nand this dissatisfaction expressed itself in attempts to evade these\r\nrates but, with the exception of individual messengers and carriers,\r\nthere was no competing system of postal communication established.\r\nOpposition took the form of evasion of postage payments by legal and\r\nillegal means. The various exceptions to the government monopoly\r\ncontinued unchanged[772] until still further modified in 1837. The\r\nadditional modifications were in the case of commissions and returns,\r\naffidavits, writs and legal proceedings, and letters sent out of the\r\nUnited Kingdom by private vessels.[773] The penalty for infringing upon\r\nthe postal monopoly was placed at £5 for every offence or £100 a week if\r\nthe offence was continued.[774]\r\n\r\n[772] 9 Anne, c. 10; 42 Geo.

The prosecutions were generally for a few letters only and the\r\ngreat majority of the cases were brought in Manchester. In the case of\r\nforty-one additional actions, the Postmaster-General did not enforce the\r\npenalties, certain explanations having been given.[775] Rowland Hill\r\nthought that the conveyance of letters by private and unauthorized\r\npeople was very widespread and the Solicitor of the Post Office agreed\r\nwith him.[776]\r\n\r\n[775] _Acc. & P._, 1834, xlix, 19, pp. 2-7.\r\n\r\n[776] _Rep.

The opinion that evasion of postage was more or less general\r\nhad been held by the public for some time as well as by a few of the\r\nPost Office officials[777] but, after the evidence upon the question was\r\npublished, there was no longer any doubt that the views of the public\r\nwere correct. Some difficulty had been anticipated that men who had\r\nviolated the law of the land would prefer not to confess their misdeeds\r\nbefore a Parliamentary Committee. They were accordingly assured that any\r\nevidence given would not be used against them, and the names of some\r\nwere expressed by letters only, when the reports were published.\r\n\r\n[777] _Ibid._, 1837-38, xx, questions 234, 2883, 4692, 10870-74; rep. 1,\r\napp., pp. 427, 431, 433; rep. 2, p. 32.\r\n\r\nThe means by which postage rates were evaded may be conveniently grouped\r\nunder two main heads, legal and illegal. The most common methods of\r\nevading postage in whole or in part by legal means were:--\r\n\r\nBy the use of Parliamentary and Official franks.[778]\r\nBy enclosing invoices and other communications in goods.[779]\r\nBy the use of codes and signals expressed by sending\r\nparticular newspapers or, when something in the nature\r\nof news or reports was to be communicated to many, an\r\nadvertisement or report was printed in a newspaper and\r\nthe newspapers were sent.[780]\r\nBy means of a letter or package sent to a mercantile house\r\nwith many letters on one sheet of paper for other people.\r\nThese were delivered by messengers. Money was sometimes\r\nsent in the same way.[781]\r\n\r\n[778] _Rep.

Their correspondents were distinguished by numbers and\r\nopposite the numbers were printed the communications for each particular\r\nperson.[782]\r\n\r\n[782] _Ibid._, rep. 1, 9, p. 427.\r\n\r\nThe majority of letters which paid no postage or only partial postage\r\nwere sent illegally, most of them by carriers. \"A.

D.\" testified that\r\ncarriers called once or twice a day at his house and that they received\r\nfrom 100 to 150 letters a week from him. Sometimes the carriers\r\ndelivered the letters on foot, sometimes they went by coach.[784] \"E.\r\nF.'s\" letters were carried by newsmen, who distributed the local\r\nnewspaper.[785] \"G. H.,\" a carrier from Scotland, said that there were\r\nsix others working with him and that they delivered about 700 letters\r\nand parcels a day, for which they received 1_d._ or 2_d._ each.[786]\r\nLetters were also illegally conveyed:--\r\n\r\nBy \"free-packets,\" containing the patterns and correspondence of\r\nmerchants, which the coachmen carried free except for the booking fee of\r\n4_d._[787]\r\n\r\nIn warehousemen's bales and parcels.[788]\r\n\r\nIn weavers' bags, especially near Glasgow. These were bags containing\r\nwork for the weavers, sent by and returned to the manufacturers.[789]\r\n\r\nBy \"family-boxes.\" Students at college in Glasgow and Edinburgh were\r\naccustomed to receive boxes of provisions, etc., from home. The\r\nneighbours made use of them to carry letters.[790]\r\n\r\nBy coachmen, guards, travellers and private individuals.[791]\r\n\r\nBy vans, railways, stage-coaches, steamboats, and every conceivable\r\nmeans.[792]\r\n\r\nBy writing in newspapers, sometimes with invisible ink or by enclosing\r\naccounts or letters in them.[793]\r\n\r\n[783] _Ibid._, qs. 2265, 2279.\r\n\r\n[784] _Ibid._, 1837-38, xx, qs. 2697, 2699, 2703.\r\n\r\n[785] _Ibid._, qs. 4229.\r\n\r\n[786] _Ibid._, qs. 5125-26.

The dissatisfied do not now attempt to establish competing\r\nposts nor to evade the payment of the legal rates. Any pressure which\r\nmay be brought to remedy real or supposed grievances takes the form of\r\nan attempt to influence the department itself. It is true that a private\r\nmessenger service was established for the delivery of letters, but the\r\npromoters of that service seem to have been unaware of the fact that\r\nthey were acting in violation of the law, and a satisfactory agreement\r\nwith the department was soon concluded. As a matter of fact, it is a\r\nquestion whether succeeding governments have not been too subservient\r\nin granting the demands of certain sections of the people, notably in\r\nconnection with the telegraph and telephone systems and the question of\r\nguarantees. The position of a government which has abandoned the\r\nprinciple that any extension of services or change in postal policy\r\nshall be based upon present or anticipated financial success must\r\nnecessarily be a difficult one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE TELEGRAPH SYSTEM AS A BRANCH OF THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the acquisition of the telegraphs by the state, the\r\ndifferent telegraphic companies carried on their business in comparative\r\nharmony, a harmony which was occasionally disturbed by the entrance into\r\nthe field of competition of new claimants for the confidence of the\r\npublic. By far the most important of these companies in 1855 were the\r\nElectric and International, and the British and Irish Magnetic,\r\ncontrolling between them about 8500 miles of line and having 600\r\nstations open to the public. During the succeeding ten years, by the\r\ngrowth of the old companies and an increase in the number of the new,\r\nthe number of miles of line increased to 16,000, of telegraph stations\r\nto 2040. The number of public messages sent in 1855 was a little more\r\nthan one million, in 1860 nearly two millions, and in 1865 over four\r\nmillions and a half. The rates for a message of twenty words varied from\r\n1_s._ for a distance under fifty miles, plus 1_s._ for each additional\r\nfifty miles, to 4_s._ for a distance over 150 miles and 5_s._ to Dublin,\r\nincluding free delivery within half a mile from the telegraph\r\noffice.[797]\r\n\r\nIn 1860 a competing company, the London District Telegraph Company,\r\nstarted operations in the Metropolitan District, and offered a low rate\r\nof 6_d._ a message. In the following year a far more dangerous rival,\r\nthe United Kingdom Telegraph Company, announced that henceforth it would\r\ncharge a uniform shilling rate irrespective of distance. Four years\r\nlater both of these companies fell into line, forced according to some\r\nby the unfair tactics of their competitors, according to others by the\r\nutter impossibility of making both ends meet, while charging a uniform\r\nrate irrespective of distance. The tariff agreed to in 1865 was as\r\nfollows:--[797] _Acc. & P._, 1867-68, xli, 202, pp. 43, 73, 74.\r\n\r\n For a distance not exceeding 100 miles   1_s._\r\n                from 100 to 200 miles     1_s._ 6_d._\r\n                beyond 200 miles          2_s._\r\n Between Great Britain and Ireland   from 3_s._ to 6_s._\r\n\r\nIn some cases these rates applied only to wires of a single company,\r\nand, where a message was transmitted over the wires of two or more\r\ncompanies, an additional charge was made. Special rates were offered for\r\npress messages, the news being supplied by the agency of the\r\nintelligence department of the telegraph companies.[798]\r\n\r\n[798] _Acc. & P._, 1867-68, xli, 202, pp. 87-88, 126; _Rep. Com._,\r\n1867-68, xi, 435, pp. 31, 68.\r\n\r\nThe earliest proposal for government ownership of the telegraphs seems\r\nto have originated with Thomas Allan, the same Allan who was later\r\ninstrumental in establishing the United Kingdom Telegraph Company. In\r\n1854 he submitted arguments to the government through Sir Rowland Hill\r\nin favour of the change, arguments which met with the approval of Lord\r\nStanley, the President of the Board of Trade, and Mr. Ricardo, formerly\r\nChairman of the International Electric Telegraph Company, and ex-member\r\nfor Stoke. Two years later Mr. Barnes, an official in the Post Office\r\nDepartment, submitted to my Lords a plan \"for the establishment in\r\nconnection with the Post Office of a comprehensive scheme of electric\r\ntelegraphs throughout the kingdom.\" In 1866, Lord Stanley, as\r\nPostmaster-General, in a letter to the Lords of the Treasury called\r\ntheir attention to the fact that the question of the propriety of the\r\nassumption by the government of the telegraphic systems of the Kingdom\r\nhad been revived in the previous year by the Edinburgh Chamber of\r\nCommerce, and still more recently the proposition had been embodied in a\r\npetition from the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United\r\nKingdom. As he himself had for many years been in favour of such a\r\nchange and found his opinion shared by more than one important body of\r\npublic men, he directed Mr. Scudamore[799] to report whether, in his\r\nopinion, the telegraphs could be successfully operated by the Post\r\nOffice, whether such operation would result in any advantages to the\r\npublic over the present system by means of private companies, and\r\nwhether it would entail upon the department any large expenditure beyond\r\nthe purchase of existing rights.[800]\r\n\r\n[799] Receiver and Accountant-General of the Post-Office.\r\n\r\n[800] _Rep. Com._, 1867-68, xi, 435, p. 108; _Acc. & P._, 1867-68, xli,\r\n202, p. 7.\r\n\r\nThe report presented by Mr. Scudamore was strongly in favour of the\r\ncontrol of the telegraphs by the Post Office, and is especially\r\ninteresting in furnishing an abstract of the evils which the people\r\nconsidered that the companies were inflicting upon them. The most\r\nimportant of these evils, real or imaginary, were as follows:--\r\n\r\nExorbitant charges and a resulting failure to expand on the part of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nDelay and inaccuracy in the transmission of messages.\r\n\r\nFailure to serve many important towns and communities.\r\n\r\nInconvenient situation, in many places, of the telegraph office, it\r\nbeing often at a considerable distance from the business centre of the\r\ntown, especially when in the railway station.\r\n\r\nInconveniently short periods that offices are open in many places.\r\n\r\nWasteful competition between the companies.\r\n\r\nThe strongest argument against the existing condition was rather a\r\nresult of competition than private ownership. In the more populous\r\ncentres the companies very often had their telegraph offices at a very\r\nshort distance from each other, being so situated as to compete for the\r\npublic patronage, while other and more outlying portions of the town\r\nwere quite unserved. The latter were thus made to suffer in order that\r\nfavoured portions might enjoy the somewhat doubtful boon of competition.\r\nIn order to show the failure to extend telegraphic facilities, Mr.\r\nScudamore compiled a list of towns in England and Wales having an\r\nindividual population of two thousand or more. In his own words \"So far\r\nas telegraphic accommodation is concerned, while thirty per cent of the\r\nwhole number of places named ... are well served, forty per cent are\r\nindifferently served, twelve per cent badly served, and eighteen per\r\ncent, having an aggregate population of more than half a million\r\npersons, not served at all.\" By combining the telegraphic business with\r\nthe postal service, there seemed every reason to suppose that its\r\nadvantages could be more widely extended, the hours of attendance\r\nincreased, charges reduced, and facilities given for the transmission of\r\nmoney orders by telegraph.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore proposed to open telegraph offices in all places which had\r\na population of 2000 and upwards and which already had money-order\r\noffices. All other post offices were empowered to receive telegrams,\r\nwhich were to be sent by post to the nearest telegraph office for\r\ntransmission. The charge was to be made uniform at 1_s._ for twenty\r\nwords and 6_d._ for each additional ten words, or part thereof. He\r\njudged that the whole of the property and rights of the telegraph\r\ncompanies might be purchased for a sum within £2,400,000, and £100,000\r\nmore would have to be spent in the extension of the service. His\r\nestimate for gross annual product was £676,000; annual charge, £81,250;\r\nworking expenses, £456,000; surplus, £138,750.[801] Finally, his reply\r\nto Lord Stanley's question was in effect that the telegraph system might\r\nbe beneficially worked by the Post Office, that there would be\r\nadvantages thus obtained over any system of private ownership, and that\r\nthe Post Office would have to bear no expense not amply covered by the\r\nrevenue.[802] In fairness to Mr. Scudamore, it should be remembered that\r\nhis original low estimate of the probable cost of the telegraph\r\ncompanies did not include Reuter's and other important companies. In\r\naddition, the strict monopoly conferred in 1869, with the necessary\r\naccompaniment of the purchase of all inland telegraph companies,\r\nentirely upset his original estimates. Finally, the decision to include\r\nthe public telegraph business of the railways and the excessive price\r\npaid to the railway and telegraph companies should not be forgotten in\r\ncontrasting the estimated price with that eventually paid for the\r\nacquisition of the telegraph systems in the United Kingdom.[803] Mr.\r\nGrimston, the Chairman of the Electric and International Telegraph\r\nCompany, contended that the extension of telegraphic facilities to any\r\nconsiderable number of small towns and villages would involve a loss to\r\nthe state by greatly increasing working expenses, that village\r\npostmasters and postmistresses were totally unable to work the\r\ntelegraphs, and that consolidation could be effected more advantageously\r\nby the companies themselves.[804]\r\n\r\n[801] In another place his estimate for gross revenue was £608,000;\r\nannual charge £105,000 on a purchase price of £3,000,000 with expenses\r\nfor improvement; working expenses £425,000, and surplus £77,750 (_Acc. &\r\nP._, 1867-68, xli, 202, pp. 145-47).\r\n\r\n[802] _Ibid._, pp. 7-39.\r\n\r\n[803] _Parl. Deb._, 3d ser., ccxxviii, col. 215; cxcii, coll. 747-751.\r\n\r\n[804] _Acc. & P._, 1867-68, xli, 202, p. 131.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, the Postmaster-General was given authority by act of Parliament\r\nto purchase the undertakings of the telegraph companies and also the\r\ninterests of the railways in the conveyance of public messages, together\r\nwith a perpetual way-leave for telegraphic purposes over the properties\r\nof the railway companies. Any telegraph company, with the authority of\r\ntwo thirds of the votes of its shareholders, was empowered to sell to\r\nthe Postmaster-General all or any portion of its undertaking. When the\r\nPostmaster-General had acquired the property of any telegraph company,\r\nhe must also, upon the request of any other company, purchase its\r\nundertaking, this privilege being extended also to the railways so far\r\nas telegraphs operated by them for transmitting public messages were\r\nconcerned. The price paid for the Electric and International, the\r\nBritish and Irish Magnetic, and the United Kingdom Telegraph Companies\r\nwas fixed at twenty years' purchase of their net profits for the year\r\nending 30th June, 1868. In the case of the United Kingdom Telegraph\r\nCompany additional sums were to be paid for the Hughes type-printing\r\npatent, for the estimated aggregate value of its ordinary share capital\r\nas determined by its highest quotation on any day between the 1st and\r\n25th days of June, 1868, for compensation for the loss of prospective\r\nprofits on its ordinary shares, and any sum that might be determined as\r\nloss for its attempt to establish a uniform shilling rate. Every officer\r\nor clerk of the companies who had been in receipt of a salary for not\r\nless than five years or of remuneration amounting to not less than £50 a\r\nyear for not less than seven years, if he received no offer from the\r\nPostmaster-General of an appointment in the telegraphic department of\r\nthe Post Office equal in the opinion of an arbitrator to his former\r\nposition, was entitled to receive an annuity equal to two thirds of his\r\nannual emolument if he had been in service twenty years, such annuity to\r\nbe diminished by one twentieth for every year less than twenty. Those\r\nentering the service of the Postmaster-General were entitled to count\r\ntheir past continuous years of service with the companies as years in\r\nthe service of the Crown.\r\n\r\nFor the most part all the telegraph apparatus belonging to the railway\r\ncompanies and all belonging to the telegraph companies on the railway\r\nlines necessary for the private business of the railways were handed\r\nover to the railways by the Postmaster-General free of charge. He was\r\ngiven the use, from telegraph stations not on the railway lines, of all\r\nthe wires of the telegraph companies on the lines employed exclusively\r\nin the public telegraph business. The railways might affix wires to the\r\nposts of the Postmaster-General on the line, and in like manner he might\r\nrequire the railways to affix wires to their own posts for the use of\r\nthe Post Office or erect new posts and wires. Finally the railways were\r\nrequired to act as agents of the Postmaster-General, if required, for\r\nreceiving and transmitting messages. The railways as a rule succeeded in\r\ndriving a very sharp bargain with the Government for the purchase of\r\ntheir interests in the public telegraph business. The price paid was\r\ntwenty years' purchase of the net receipts from public telegrams\r\nreckoned for the year ending 30th June, 1868, plus twenty times the\r\nincrease in net receipts for the three preceding years or for such\r\nshorter period as the business of transmitting public telegrams had been\r\nundertaken. In addition, compensation was made for the rents, etc.,\r\npayable to the railways by the telegraph companies, for the unexpired\r\nperiod of their respective agreements, for the right of way obtained by\r\nthe Postmaster-General over the lands of the railways, for the loss of\r\npower on the part of the railways to grant way-leaves, for the value of\r\nthe railways' reversionary interests (if any) in the transmission of\r\npublic messages on the expiration of the agreements with the telegraph\r\ncompanies, and for any loss the railways might suffer in working their\r\ntelegraph business as a separate concern. Finally the Postmaster-General\r\nwas required to convey free of charge to any part of the United Kingdom\r\nall messages of the railways relating to their own private\r\nbusiness.[805] The act empowering the Postmaster-General to purchase the\r\nundertakings of the telegraph companies did not confer upon the Post\r\nOffice a monopoly in the transmission of telegrams, Mr. Scudamore\r\nhimself declaring that such a monopoly was neither desirable nor did the\r\nPost Office wish it. The second act, however, declared that no\r\ntelegraphic messages, except those sent from or to any place outside of\r\nthe United Kingdom, should be transmitted by any telegraphic company for\r\ngain unless the company was in existence on the 22d of June, 1869, and\r\nwas not for the time being acquired by the Postmaster-General, who\r\nshould be required to purchase its undertaking upon demand.[806]\r\n\r\n[805] 31 and 32 Vict., c. 110.\r\n\r\n[806] 32 and 33 Vict., c. 75.\r\n\r\nMr. Scudamore's original estimate of the cost of acquisition of the\r\ntelegraphs fell far short of the final expenditure; although it must be\r\nremembered that, when he proposed £2,500,000 as sufficient, he did not\r\nanticipate items of expense which later vastly increased the cost.\r\nBefore the committee which reported in 1868 he advanced his original\r\nestimate to £6,000,000, and in the following year to £6,750,000, of\r\nwhich he considered about two thirds to be of the nature of good-will.\r\nThe telegraph companies when first approached asked for twenty-five\r\nyears' purchase of their prospective profits, and the Government offered\r\nto buy at the highest price realized on the Stock Exchange up to the\r\n25th of May, with an addition of from 10 to 15 per cent for compulsory\r\nsale. The cost of the leading companies, based upon twenty years'\r\npurchase of the net profits for the year ending 30th June, 1868, was as\r\nfollows: For the Electric and International, £2,933,826; for the British\r\nand Irish Magnetic, £1,243,536; for Reuter's, £726,000; for the United\r\nKingdom Electric, £562,000; and for the Universal Private, £184,421,--a\r\ntotal of £5,650,047. Separate bargains followed with many smaller\r\ncompanies. The acts of 1868 and 1869 granted £8,000,000, for the purpose\r\nof purchasing the undertakings of the companies and the interests of the\r\nrailways; £6,640,000 were spent in purchases, and £1,560,000 in renewals\r\nand extensions between 1868 and 1872.[807] The claims for compensation\r\non the part of some of the railways were very excessive. The Lancashire\r\nand Yorkshire Railway asked for £1,129,814, with interest, and £1 per\r\nwire per mile a year for all wires erected upon its right of way by or\r\nfor the Post Office. By the terms of the award they obtained £169,197\r\nand 1_s._ per mile per wire. The Great Eastern Railway presented a claim\r\nfor £412,608, with interest, and £1 per mile per wire. Their claim was\r\nreduced to £73,315 and an annual payment of £200 for way-leave. In all,\r\nthe capital sum of £10,880,571 was expended by the Government,\r\nnecessitating an annual interest payment of £326,417, charged, not on\r\nthe Post Office vote, but on the Consolidated Fund.[808]\r\n\r\n[807] _Rep.

G._, 1876, p. 10; _ibid._, 1883, p. 9.\r\n\r\nWhen the Post Office acquired the telegraphs, a uniform rate was\r\nintroduced of 1_s._ for twenty words or part thereof and 3_d._ for each\r\nadditional five words or part thereof, exclusive of the names and\r\naddresses of sender and receiver, which were transmitted free. Delivery\r\nwas free within a radius of one mile from the terminal telegraphic\r\noffice, or within the limit of the town postal delivery when it\r\ncontained a head office and the postal delivery extended more than a\r\nmile from it. Beyond the above limits the charge did not exceed 6_d._\r\nper double mile or part thereof. When special delivery was not required\r\nbeyond the free delivery, the message was sent free by the next ordinary\r\npostal delivery. The newspapers succeeded in having incorporated within\r\nthe act a clause prohibiting a higher charge for press messages than\r\n1_s._ for every one hundred words transmitted between 6 P.M. and 9 A.M.,\r\nor 1_s._ for every seventy-five words between 9 A.M. and 6 P.M. when\r\nsent to a single address, the charge for the transmission of the same\r\ntelegram to each additional address to be not greater than 2_d._[809] On\r\nthe day of transfer the Post Office was able to open about a thousand\r\npostal telegraph offices and nineteen hundred offices at railway\r\nstations where the railways dealt with the public messages as agents of\r\nthe Postmaster-General. On the 31st of March, 1872, the system comprised\r\nmore than five thousand offices (including nineteen hundred at railway\r\nstations), twenty-two thousand miles of line, with an aggregate of\r\neighty-three thousand miles of wire, and more than six thousand\r\ninstruments. A decided increase in the number of messages was the\r\nresult. During the first year after the transfer there were nearly ten\r\nmillions of messages, the second year twelve millions, and the third\r\nyear fifteen millions, or more than double the number transmitted in\r\n1869. The period from 1872 to the adoption of a sixpenny tariff in 1885\r\nwas one of steady progress. The number of new offices opened was not\r\nnumerous, the increase having been only one thousand, but the\r\nimprovements in existing connections were marked and the number of\r\nmessages transmitted had increased to thirty-three millions. The new\r\ntariff rate was 6_d._ for twelve words or less, with a halfpenny for\r\neach additional word, but the old system of free addresses was\r\nabolished. Under the old tariff each figure was charged at a single\r\nrate. Under the new schedule five figures were counted as one word. A\r\nlarge proportion of telegrams were brought within the minimum sixpenny\r\nrate, while the average charge, which had been 1_s._ 1_d._ in 1885, was\r\nreduced to 8_d._ in 1886. The number of messages increased from\r\nthirty-three millions in 1884-85 to fifty millions in 1886-87. Four\r\ncables between France and England and one between France and the Jersey\r\nIsles were purchased by the governments of the two countries, two by the\r\nBelgian and English governments, two between Holland and England, and\r\none between Germany and England, by the governments of the countries\r\ninterested.[810]\r\n\r\n[809] 31 and 32 Vict., c. 110.\r\n\r\nFollowing the adoption of a uniform sixpenny rate the department has\r\ngranted other facilities to the public, which, though popular enough,\r\nhave undoubtedly tended to place the working of the telegraphs upon a\r\nless secure financial basis. In 1889, the issue of telegraphic money\r\norders was begun as an experiment, and in the same year was extended to\r\nall head and branch post offices in the United Kingdom.[811] Two years\r\nlater the Post Office ceased to require the repayment of the capital\r\noutlay on telegraph extensions made under guarantee, and the rural\r\nsanitary authorities were empowered to defray the cost of such\r\nextensions in places within their districts.[812] For the six preceding\r\nyears the average annual number of guaranteed telegraph offices was\r\nseventy-seven, and during the next five years the average annual number\r\nincreased to 167. As part of the Jubilee concessions in 1897, the\r\nguarantors were required to pay only one half of the deficiency, with\r\nthe result that during the following two years the average annual number\r\nof guaranteed telegraphic offices increased to 290. At the same time the\r\nfree delivery limit was extended to three miles and a reduction was\r\ngranted in the porterage charges beyond that distance. Finally, in 1905,\r\nthe guarantee was reduced to one third of the loss incurred, the\r\ndelivery charge being fixed at 3_d._ a mile for the distance beyond the\r\nthree-mile limit, instead of the distance from the office of\r\ndelivery.[813]\r\n\r\n[810] _Rep.

London and\r\nBirmingham were first connected, and the line was ultimately extended\r\nthrough Stafford to Warrington, where it joined existing underground\r\nwires between Manchester, Liverpool, and Chester. By 1905, underground\r\nwires were laid as far north as Glasgow through Carlisle, to be extended\r\nlater to Edinburgh. At Manchester a junction was effected with a line\r\npassing through Bradford to Leeds. During the same year underground\r\nlines were completed from London to Chatham and from London westward\r\ntoward Bristol, with the intention of extending it into Cornwall in\r\norder to secure communication with the Atlantic and Mediterranean\r\ncables.[814]\r\n\r\n[814] _Ibid._, 1900, p. 15; 1902, p. 13; 1905, app., p. 99; 1906, p. 16.\r\n\r\nIn 1875, England joined the other important European powers in a\r\ntelegraphic agreement which went into effect in January of the following\r\nyear. By this agreement each of the contracting parties agreed to devote\r\nspecial wires to international service, government telegrams to have\r\nprecedence in transmission and to be forwarded in code if desired.\r\nPrivate telegrams could also be sent in code between those countries\r\nwhich allowed them, and the signatory powers agreed to pass them in\r\ntransit, but each country reserved to itself the privilege of stopping\r\nany private telegram. For the purpose of making charges, any country\r\nmight be divided into not more than two zones, and each of the signatory\r\npowers owed to the others an account of charges collected.[815] So far\r\nas foreign telegrams were concerned, the use of manufactured expressions\r\nin place of real words gave rise to considerable trouble in view of the\r\nfact that such combinations were difficult to transmit. In 1879, the\r\nlanguages which might be used for code words were reduced by common\r\nconsent to English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch,\r\nand Latin. At the same time the use of proper names as code words was\r\nprohibited. This did not remove the evil, as the roots of words in one\r\nlanguage with terminations in another were used. An official vocabulary\r\nwas compiled by the International Telegraph Bureau, to become obligatory\r\nin 1898, but its publication in 1894 aroused considerable opposition, as\r\nmany of the words were dangerously alike, and in 1896 the decision of\r\nthe Paris Conference of 1890, by which the official vocabulary was to\r\nbecome compulsory for European telegrams in 1898, was rescinded. It was\r\nalso decided that an enlarged vocabulary should be published by the\r\nInternational Bureau, but, owing to the action of the English delegates,\r\nthe official vocabulary was not made compulsory at the meeting of the\r\nInternational Telegraph Conference in 1903, although artificial words\r\nwere allowed if pronounceable in accordance with the usages of any one\r\nof the eight languages from which the ordinary code words might be\r\nselected. It was also decided to admit letter cipher at the rate of five\r\nletters to a word, and several countries agreed to lower their charges\r\nfor the transmission of extra-European telegrams, the English delegates\r\ncontending that the rates for such telegrams should be made the same as\r\nthe rates for European telegrams.[816] In 1878, negotiations with the\r\nGerman and Netherland Telegraph Administrations resulted in a charge of\r\n4_d._ a word being fixed as the rate between the United Kingdom and\r\nGermany and 3_d._ a word between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n[815] _Acc. & P._, 1876, lxxxiv [c. 1418], pp. 116-119.\r\n\r\n[816] _Rep.

The\r\ntransmission of foreign money orders by telegraph was inaugurated in\r\n1898 by the opening of an exchange with Germany and its extension\r\nshortly afterward to the other important European countries.[817]\r\n\r\n[817] _Rep. P. G._, 1897, pp. 40-42; 1879, p. 21; 1886, p. 10; 1892, p.\r\n19; 1900, p. 10.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, an attempt was made, curiously suggestive of Marconi's\r\ndiscovery, to transmit telegraph messages without a direct wire. The\r\nexperiment was conducted between the island of Flat Holm in the Bristol\r\nChannel and the mainland, a distance of three miles. A wire was erected\r\non the mainland parallel with one on the island, and, by means of strong\r\nvibratory currents sent through the former, signals were transmitted and\r\nmessages exchanged. Three years later and before the practical value of\r\nthe Flat Holm experiment had been substantiated, Mr. Marconi arrived in\r\nEngland to submit his plans to the Post Office. A private wire from\r\nPoldhu to Falmouth was provided for him on the usual rental terms, and\r\nit was announced that the Post Office would act as his agent for\r\ncollecting messages to be transmitted by wireless telegraphy when he had\r\nproved the feasibility of his project. At the international congress on\r\nwireless telegraphy held in Berlin in 1903 it was recommended that shore\r\nstations equipped with wireless apparatus should be bound to exchange\r\nmessages with ships at sea without regard to the system of wireless\r\ntelegraphy employed by the latter, that the rate of charge for the shore\r\nstation should be subject to the approval of the state where it was\r\nsituated, the rate of the ship to the approval of the state whose flag\r\nit carried, and that the working of wireless stations should be\r\nregulated so as to interfere with other stations as little as possible.\r\nIn order to enable the Government to carry out the decision of the\r\ncongress and to place wireless telegraphy under its control for\r\nstrategic purposes, an act was passed in 1904 making it illegal to\r\ninstal or work wireless telegraphic apparatus in the United Kingdom or\r\non board a British ship in territorial waters without the licence of the\r\nPostmaster-General. The act was to be operative for two years only, but\r\nbefore its expiration, was extended until the 31st of December, 1909,\r\nbefore which it might again be renewed. Arrangements were also made for\r\nthe collection and delivery of the telegrams of the Marconi Company by\r\nthe post offices throughout the country. The company charges its usual\r\nrate, 6_d._. a word, and the Post Office in addition charges the\r\nordinary inland rate.[818] The international agreement providing for\r\ncompulsory communication between shore stations and ships was signed in\r\n1906 in spite of the protests of the Marconi Company, Sir Edward\r\nSassoon, and others, who contended that the agreement was unfair to the\r\ncompany and a mistake on the part of the Kingdom, \"which was thus giving\r\nup advantages obtained by the possession of the best system of wireless\r\ntelegraphy in the world.\" The majority of the countries represented were\r\nalso in favour of compulsory communication between ship and ship, but\r\nthis was successfully negatived by Great Britain and Japan. In 1908, Mr.\r\nBuxton was able to announce in the House that the relations between the\r\nPost Office and the Marconi Company \"are now of the most friendly kind,\"\r\nand that they have accepted and adopted the principle of\r\nintercommunication. In the preceding year two experimental stations were\r\nstarted by the Government which will enable the department to extend\r\nits operations quite independently of the companies.[819]\r\n\r\n[818] _Rep.

In addition,\r\nthe Telegraph Department, for some time previous to 1874, had been\r\ndrawing upon the balance in the possession of the Post Office, a balance\r\nwhich was required to be invested for other purposes and whose\r\nexpenditure for the use of the telegraphs had not been authorized by\r\nParliament. Mr. Goldsmid, in introducing a motion for the appointment of\r\na committee of enquiry, alluded to this error on the part of the\r\ndepartment, to the excessive price paid for the telegraphs, and\r\ncomplained that the telegraph system was not being operated on a paying\r\nbasis. His motion was withdrawn, but an agreement was reached with the\r\ndepartment by the appointment of a committee, with Mr. Playfair as\r\nchairman, \"to inquire into the organization and financial system of the\r\nTelegraph Department of the Post Office.\" The committee in their report\r\ncommented unfavourably upon the unnecessarily large force, the cumbrous\r\norganization, and the far from economical management of some of the\r\ndivisions of the department, advised that an attempt be made to remedy\r\nthese faults, and that press messages be charged a minimum rate of 1_s._\r\neach, and not at the rate of 1_s._ for each seventy-five or one hundred\r\nwords obtained by adding together separate messages requiring separate\r\ntransmission. This suggestion with reference to press messages was\r\nadopted, promises were made at the same time to diminish the force, and\r\na scheme was submitted for the reorganization of the department.[820]\r\n\r\n[820] _Parl. Deb._, 3d ser., ccxxviii, coll. 172 f.; _Rep. Com._, 1876,\r\nxiii, 357, pp. i-xiii, 147, 240.\r\n\r\nThe number of telegrams for the year ending 31st March, 1887, the year\r\nfollowing the sixpenny reduction, was 50,243,639; for the year 1891-92\r\nit had increased to 69,685,480. In 1896-97 the number was 79,423,556 and\r\nin 1899-1900 the total was 90,415,123. During the next three years there\r\nwas a reduction, followed in 1902-03 by an increase to 92,471,000.\r\nSince 1902-03 the number has again fallen off, the figures for 1906-07\r\nbeing only 89,493,000.[821] It is rather difficult to make definite\r\nstatements about the telegraph finances on account of the lack of\r\nuniformity in presenting the accounts since 1870. Under gross revenue is\r\nnow included the value of services done for other departments, but this\r\nwas not always the rule. The expenditure of other departments for the\r\ntelegraph service may or may not be included under ordinary telegraphic\r\nexpenditure. Net revenue may also be increased or a deficit changed to a\r\nsurplus by deducting the expenditure for sites, buildings, and\r\nextensions from ordinary expenditure. Finally, the interest on capital\r\nis not charged on the Telegraph Vote, and so is not included under\r\nexpenditure. In 1871, 1880, and 1881 there seem to have been surpluses\r\nover all expenditure, including interest on capital. Excluding interest\r\nfrom expenditure, the net revenue decreased from £303,457 in 1871 to\r\n£59,732 in 1875, when the pensions to officials of the telegraph\r\ncompanies were first charged to the Telegraph Vote. With an increased\r\nnet revenue of £245,116 in 1876, following the report of the committee\r\nof investigation, the department did very well from a financial point of\r\nview, until 1884, when the net revenue fell to £51,255, and in 1887\r\nthere was a deficit of £84,078, due to the fact that expenses were\r\nincreasing at a greater rate than receipts. The sixpenny reduction seems\r\nto have made but little change in the financial situation, the gross\r\nrevenue increasing from £1,755,118 in 1884-85 to £1,855,686 in 1886-87,\r\nthe expenditure for the same years being £1,731,040 and £1,939,734. The\r\nnet revenue began to recover in 1888-89, and averaged about £150,000 a\r\nyear during the four years ending March 31, 1892. During the fiscal\r\nyears 1894 and 1895 there were deficits, then a slight recovery from\r\n1896 to 1900 and a succession of deficits from 1901 to 1905. The\r\ninterest on stock, £214,500 in 1870, increased steadily to £326,417 in\r\n1880, at which figure it remained until 1889, when a reduction in the\r\nrate of interest from 3 per cent to 2-3/4 per cent lowered the amount\r\npayable to £299,216. In 1903, there was a further reduction to\r\n£278,483.[822]\r\n\r\n[821] _Rep. P.

Mr. Blackwood, the Financial Secretary of the Post Office,\r\nin his evidence before the committee, considered that the financial\r\ncontrol and oversight of the department were inadequate and that the\r\ndepartment was over-manned. On the other hand, he was of the opinion\r\nthat many expenses were met by revenue expenditure which should have\r\nbeen charged to capital. Mr. Baines, the Surveyor-General, among other\r\ncauses of the financial deficiency, called attention to the shorter\r\nhours and longer annual leave of the telegraph staff as government\r\nemployees, the higher standard of efficiency established by the Post\r\nOffice, and the prevalence of much overtime work as a result of the\r\nmaintenance by the companies, just before the transfer, of an inadequate\r\nstaff.[823] The fact that the yearly increase in messages continued to\r\ndiminish after 1879 is commented on by the Postmaster-General in 1884 as\r\ndue to the stagnation of trade, the competition of the telephones, and\r\nthe rapidity of the letter post. Mr. Raikes called attention to the\r\nlarge number of telegrams on the business of the railways which were\r\ntransmitted for nothing. By an agreement with several of the railway\r\ncompanies to send, as a right instead of a privilege, a fixed number of\r\nmessages containing a fixed number of words, this increase was checked.\r\nIn 1892, the following comment is found in the Postmaster-General's\r\nReport: \"This stagnation of business, viewed in connection with an\r\nincreased cost in working expenses, is a matter for serious\r\nconsideration, and necessarily directs attention to that part of the\r\nbusiness which is conducted at a loss,\" the reference being to the\r\nincreased number of press messages transmitted at a nominal charge. When\r\nin 1868 the newspaper proprietors succeeded in obtaining the insertion\r\nin the Telegraph Act of special rates for the transmission of press\r\nmessages, no condition was laid down that copies, in order that they\r\nmight be sent at the very low charges there enumerated, should be\r\ntransmitted to the same place as the original telegram. The newspapers\r\ncombined to receive messages from news associations in identical terms,\r\nand, by dividing the cost, obtained a rate equal on the average to 4-1/2\r\n_d._ per hundred words. Under the arrangements adopted for the\r\ntransmission of news messages the number of words so sent did not\r\nnecessitate a corresponding amount of work, but it is an interesting\r\nfact that in 1895 the number of words dealt with for the press formed\r\ntwo fifths of the total number. In that year the loss on these telegrams\r\nwas estimated at about £300,000 a year. The high price paid as purchase\r\nmoney is another of the factors to be considered, only in so far,\r\nhowever, as the Telegraphic Department has failed to meet the interest\r\non the debt so incurred. The telegraph companies were very liberally\r\ntreated, and in certain cases excessive prices were undoubtedly paid.\r\nProbably the most important reason for the financial failure of the\r\ntelegraphs under government ownership and control has been the influence\r\nof forces productive of good in themselves, but quite different from\r\nthose which had previously been dominant when the telegraphs were under\r\nprivate control and during the early years of government management. The\r\neffect of these forces is clearly seen in the reduction of the tariff in\r\n1885, the extension of facilities under inadequate guarantee, and the\r\nincrease in the pay of the staff.[824] Mr. Buxton is of the opinion that\r\nthe worst feature of the postal business is the telegraph service. \"It\r\nhas never been profitable and now the telephone system has so largely\r\ntaken its place that the revenue is falling off,\" while the \"Economist\"\r\nconsiders that \"it is obvious that both in the Savings Bank and the\r\nTelegraph branches reforms are urgently needed in order to place matters\r\non a sound financial basis.\"[825]\r\n\r\n[823] Between 1870, when the telegraphs were taken over by the state,\r\nand 1873, the number of employees was more than doubled, although,\r\nduring the same period, the number of messages--not including news\r\nmessages--increased only from ten to fifteen millions (_Rep. Com._,\r\n1876, xiii, 357, pp. 18, 90, 232, 240).\r\n\r\n[824] _Rep. P. G._, 1895, pp. 37-38.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of the amount spent on salaries and wages which in 1881,\r\nbefore Mr. Fawcett's revision, stood at about 55 per cent, increased, as\r\na result of that revision and Mr. Raikes' revision in 1890, to about 65\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n[825] _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., clix, col. 389; _Economist_, Sept. 21,\r\n1907, p. 1576.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE POST OFFICE AND THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first telephone brought to England by Lord Kelvin in 1876 was a very\r\ncrude instrument, useful only for experimental purposes and of interest\r\nonly as a forecast of later development. In the following year two Post\r\nOffice officials introduced some machines which had been presented to\r\nthem by the American inventor Bell, and although not very efficient,\r\nthey were of some commercial use. The Post Office made arrangements with\r\nthe agents of the inventor for the purpose of supplying its private wire\r\nrenters with these machines if they should wish to make use of them.\r\nWith the invention of the microphone in 1878, and its application to the\r\ntelephone, a thoroughly practical method of transmitting speech was at\r\nlast introduced. In the same year a company was formed to acquire and\r\nwork the Bell patents. They endeavoured to come to an agreement with the\r\nPost Office by which the latter might obtain telephones at cost price,\r\nand would in return facilitate the operations of the company, but the\r\nnegotiations came to nothing. There was then no suggestion of an\r\nexchange system, and the company proposed merely to supply telephones\r\nand wires to private individuals. In 1879, the Edison Telephone Company\r\nof London was established, an announcement having been made in the\r\nautumn of 1878 that it was proposed to establish exchanges. An attempt\r\nwas made to amend the Telegraph Act so as to confer specifically upon\r\nthe department monopolistic control over telephonic communication, but\r\nthe amendment failed to receive the sanction of the House of Commons.\r\nThe Postmaster-General then filed information against both companies, on\r\nthe ground that the transmission of messages by telephone was an\r\ninfringement of the telegraphic monopoly. In the summer of 1880 the two\r\ncompanies amalgamated as the United Telephone Company, and in December\r\njudgment was given by the High Court of Justice in favour of the Post\r\nOffice.[826]\r\n\r\n[826] _Rep. Com._, 1895, xiii, 350, pp. 1-6; _Law Reports, Queen's Bench\r\nDivision_, vi, p. 244; _Parl. Deb._, 3d ser., cclxxxviii, col. 1053.\r\n\r\nIn April of 1881 the Postmaster-General granted the United Telephone\r\nCompany a licence to establish and operate a telephone system within a\r\nfive-mile radius in London, the central point to be chosen by the\r\ncompany. On the other hand the company agreed to pay a royalty of 10 per\r\ncent of its gross receipts and to accept the judgment of the High Court.\r\nLicences were also granted to establish telephone exchanges in the\r\nprovincial towns within a radius of one or two miles, all the licences\r\nto expire in 1911. The Postmaster-General reserved the right to\r\nestablish exchanges for the department and the option of purchasing the\r\nworks of the licencees in 1890 or at seven-year intervals from 1890, six\r\nmonths' notice having first been given. The policy of the United\r\nTelephone Company was to confine its own operations to London and to\r\nallow patent apparatus to be used in other parts of the country by\r\nsubsidiary companies, leaving them free to negotiate with the Post\r\nOffice for provincial licences.\r\n\r\nThe telephone policy of the Post Office from 1880 to 1884 consisted in\r\nthe granting of licences to the companies in restricted areas, so that\r\nthe telegraph revenue might suffer from competition as little as\r\npossible, and the establishment by the department of exchanges in\r\ncertain places not as a rule served by the companies. Owing to the\r\nrefusal of the Government to solicit business, their exchanges did not\r\nprove a success. The department itself would probably have preferred to\r\ntake over the whole telephone business in 1880, but this policy met with\r\nno favour from the Lords of the Treasury, who were of the opinion \"that\r\nthe state, as regards all functions which are not by their nature\r\nexclusively its own, should at most be ready to supplement, not\r\nendeavour to supersede private enterprise, and that a rough but not\r\ninaccurate test of the legitimacy of its procedure is not to act in\r\nanticipation of possible demands.\" The operation by the government of\r\nthe unimportant exchanges possessed by them was sanctioned by their\r\nLordships, \"on the understanding that its object is by the establishment\r\nof a telephonic system to a limited extent by the Post Office to enable\r\nyour department to negotiate with the telephone companies in a\r\nsatisfactory manner for licences.\" The London and Globe Company was\r\ngiven a licence in 1882 to establish exchanges in London, but they were\r\nentirely dependent upon the United Company for instruments, so that\r\nthere was no real competition. The department proceeded to issue\r\nlicences for the establishment of competing systems in places where\r\nthere were already government exchanges. From 1880 to 1884 the\r\nPostmaster-General granted twenty-three licences, and some twenty-seven\r\ntowns, with 1141 subscribers, were served by the department. The policy\r\nof the Post Office during these years, as thus outlined, was far from\r\nsatisfactory to the public, due largely to the desire to protect the\r\ntelegraph revenue, and the failure to appreciate the possibilities which\r\nthe new system of communication was capable of offering. The companies,\r\nrestricted as they were to local areas, could not offer any means for\r\ncommunication between these areas, since special permission had to be\r\nobtained for the erection of trunk lines. The Government offered to\r\nprovide these on condition that a direct payment of £10 a mile per\r\ndouble wire and one half the revenue over that sum should be paid for\r\ntheir use, but this offer the companies naturally refused to consider.\r\nThe Lancashire and Cheshire Company proposed to fix their trunk-line\r\ncharges so low as to pay expenses only, but they were informed by the\r\nGovernment that they must charge 10s. a mile annual rental. In addition,\r\nthey were not allowed to charge less than 1_s._ at their call offices,\r\nthe then prevailing fee for a telegram. A few trunk lines, it is true,\r\nwere constructed by the Government and rented to the companies, but they\r\nwere quite insufficient to satisfy the demand. In London, the United\r\nTelephone Company was not allowed to extend its system beyond the\r\nfive-mile radius without special permission and the payment of an\r\nincreased royalty. In addition, the companies had no way-leave powers,\r\nbut had to depend upon the good will of householders to fly their wires\r\nfrom house-top to house-top, with the result that in London there was a\r\nridiculously large number of exchanges. Finally the companies were\r\nrestricted to connecting subscribers with the exchange or their place of\r\nbusiness, and, although messages could be telephoned for further\r\ntransmission by the telegraphs, there was not that close connection\r\nbetween the telephonic and telegraphic systems which might eventually\r\nhave led to the mutual advantage of each. Moreover, in 1882, the\r\nGovernment announced that they would grant no more licences unless the\r\nsubsidiary companies agreed to sell to them all the instruments they\r\nwished, the intention probably being for the Government to supply\r\ninstruments to companies which would establish exchanges in real\r\ncompetition with the United Telephone Company. Since the subsidiary\r\ncompanies could not supply these instruments without the consent of the\r\nparent company, the only result was still further to restrict telephonic\r\ndevelopment.[827]\r\n\r\n[827] _Rep. P. G._, 1883, p. 6; 1885, p. 9; 1886, p. 10; _Rep. Com._,\r\n1898, xii, 383, pp. 3, 57; 1895, xiii, 350, pp. 1-6; _Parl. Deb._, 3d\r\nser., cclxxii, col. 712; cclxxxviii, coll. 1056-57, 1060-61; cclxxxix,\r\ncoll. 82.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, the prevailing public discontent in connection with the\r\nGovernment's treatment of the situation manifested itself in the press\r\nand in the House of Commons. The Post Office was accused of practising a\r\npolicy of strangulation toward the companies, and the\r\nPostmaster-General, Mr. Fawcett, acknowledged that there was some truth\r\nin the charge. He advised the Treasury that the companies' areas of\r\noperation should be unlimited, and that their operations should be\r\nconfined to the transmission of oral communications. The restricted\r\nlicences were withdrawn and new, unrestricted licences granted,\r\nterminable in 1911 with the same qualifications with reference to\r\nroyalties and government purchase that were inserted in the old\r\nlicences. Nominally the result produced free competition, but actually\r\ncompetition was impossible until the expiration of the fundamental\r\npatents in 1892. The year before their expiration, the companies\r\nsucceeded in getting control of the situation by an amalgamation of the\r\nUnited Telephone Company with its licencees under the name of the\r\nNational Telephone Company. Mr. Dickinson, Deputy Chairman of the London\r\nCounty Council, stated that the nominal capital of the United Telephone\r\nCompany, £900,000 (with an actual capital expenditure in 1887 within the\r\nMetropolitan District of £228,180) was taken over by the National\r\nTelephone Company at a cost of £1,484,375, and the Duke of Marlborough\r\nsaid in the House of Lords that of the £3,250,000 capital of the new\r\ncompany over £2,000,000 was \"water.\" Mr. Raikes, the Postmaster-General,\r\nwho was in favour of competition, wrote to the United Company,\r\ndisapproving of the whole transaction. With the expiration of the\r\npatent rights, the New Telephone Company was resuscitated, with the Duke\r\nof Marlborough as chairman, an agreement having been concluded with the\r\nTelephone Subscribers' Protective Association for a twelve guineas'\r\nservice in London, but it in turn was absorbed by the National Company,\r\nmuch to the disgust of the members of the Association. So far as\r\nway-leave rights were concerned the position of the companies remained\r\nin a very unsatisfactory condition. A committee of the House of Commons\r\nadvised that certain way-leave rights should be granted, but nothing was\r\naccomplished, although a bill was introduced in the House of Commons in\r\n1885 to enable the companies to erect posts without the consent of the\r\nroad authorities.[828]\r\n\r\n[828] _Rep. Com._, 1884-85, xii, p. 63; 1892, xvii, 278, sess. 1, pp.\r\n3-5; 1895, xiii, 350, pp. 1-6, 92, 188-93; 1898, xii, 383, p. 12; _Parl.\r\nDeb._, 3d ser., cclxxxviii, coll. 1052 f.; cccxxxvi, col. 1809;\r\ncccxxxvii, col. 1435; cccxlvi, col. 908.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbes, the chairman of the National Telephone Company, said to the\r\nCommittee of 1892: \"I am prepared to concede that the telephone company\r\nwhich conducts about 93 or 94 per cent of the whole telephonic business\r\nof the country conducts a great deal of it monstrously badly, but it is\r\nnot their fault, it is the fault of Parliament\"; and again in referring\r\nto the lack of way-leave power: \"Take London for instance; London is\r\nvery badly served, but why is it very badly served? Because everything\r\ndepends upon the caprice of the individual.\" As a result of the\r\ncomplaints that the telephone system was giving an inadequate service\r\nbecause of the high rates on an inflated capital, because the utility of\r\nthe telephones was impaired in that they could not be used in connection\r\nwith the telegraph and postal services, and because of the lack of\r\npowers to erect poles in the streets or to lay underground wires or to\r\nconnect their exchanges by trunk lines, the Government announced a\r\nchange of policy in 1892.[829] This change was set forth in a Treasury\r\nMinute of the 23d of May, 1892, and in two memoranda of agreement of the\r\nsame year to which the National and the New Companies were respectively\r\nparties, the arrangements being sanctioned by Parliament in the\r\nTelegraph acts of 1892 and 1896. So far as it affected the National\r\nCompany the arrangement was embodied in detail in an agreement dated the\r\n25th of March, 1896, no similar agreement being made with the New\r\nCompany because that company went into liquidation in 1892, and in 1896\r\nsurrendered its licence. By the agreement of 1896 the National Telephone\r\nCompany surrendered its previous licence except for certain definite\r\ndistricts called \"Exchange Areas,\" a large number of which were\r\nspecified in the agreement. These areas were as a rule coterminous with\r\nthe urban districts, but comprised in addition certain areas made up of\r\ntwo or more urban districts together with the intervening country. Power\r\nwas reserved to the Postmaster-General to specify other exchange areas,\r\nthe understanding being, both with regard to areas already specified and\r\nthose to be specified, that industrial areas of wide extent should be\r\nrecognized in cases where there were no considerable towns forming\r\ncentres of business, that neighbouring towns intimately connected in\r\ntheir business relations should be placed in the same area, and that\r\nsmall towns and villages should also be so grouped when each by itself\r\nwould not pay. Outside these areas the Postmaster-General alone was\r\nentitled to carry on telephone business, no more licences being granted\r\nfor the whole Kingdom, and for any particular town only with the\r\napproval of the corporation or municipal authority. Call offices for the\r\nuse of the public were to be opened at the company's exchanges and\r\nconnected with the post offices in order that exchange subscribers might\r\ntelephone over the trunk lines to exchange subscribers in other towns.\r\nWhere intercommunication took place between the systems of the company\r\nand the Post Office, a terminal charge on the part of the receiving\r\nsystem was allowed. Telephonic messages could be sent to the post\r\noffices for transmission as telegrams and delivery as such or for\r\ndelivery as letters. Express messengers could also be sent for by\r\ntelephone, and telegrams received at the post offices might be\r\ntransmitted by telephone.\r\n\r\n[829] Only five years before, Mr. Raikes, the Postmaster-General, said\r\nin the House of Commons: \"I am inclined to think that it is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether there would be much public advantage in establishing\r\ntelephonic communication generally between those [the principal] towns\"\r\n(_Parl. Deb._, 3d ser., cccxix, col. 664).\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General was authorized to grant to the company all such\r\npowers of executing works within its exchange areas (other than works\r\nunder, over, or along any railway or canal) as were conferred upon him\r\nby the Telegraph acts of 1863, 1878, and Section 2 of the act of 1892.\r\nIf required by the company, he must provide underground wires between\r\ndifferent exchanges in the same exchange area, and must allow the\r\ncompany to conclude agreements with railway and canal companies over\r\nwhose property he had exclusive right of way. In exchange for these\r\nprivileges the company agreed to sell its trunk lines to the\r\nPostmaster-General, their value being fixed at a later date at £459,114,\r\nwhich amount was paid to the company on the 4th of April, 1895, the\r\nlength of trunk line taken over being 2651 miles having 29,000 miles of\r\nwire. In order to remove a serious handicap to the success of competing\r\ncompanies, the trunk lines were henceforth to be controlled and extended\r\nby the Post Office, the company to receive five per cent of any gross\r\ncharges for trunk-line tolls which it might collect as an agent of the\r\nPost Office. The rates charged by the Post Office for trunk-line\r\nconversations in 1896 were, for distances of 125 miles and under, the\r\nsame as those previously charged by the company, and were lower than the\r\nold rates for distances in excess of 125 miles.[830]\r\n\r\n[830] _Rep. Com._, 1892, xvii, 278, sess. 1, pp. 17-18; 1895, xiii, 350,\r\npp. 8, 34; _Rep. P. G._, 1896, pp. 16, 17; _Rep.

Deb._, 4th ser., iii, coll. 168, 186, 196.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time there was evidence of considerable opposition to the\r\npractical monopoly of the company within the exchange areas. A motion\r\nintroduced in the House of Commons by Doctor Cameron, member of\r\nParliament for Glasgow, in favour of government purchase of the\r\ntelephones, received considerable support, but was rejected by the\r\nGovernment on the ground that the resulting increase in the number of\r\ncivil servants, not paid at market wages and constantly trying to bring\r\npressure to bear on members, was too serious an evil to receive the\r\nsanction of the Government.[831] The claim was also made by some of the\r\ntowns and by Glasgow in particular that the municipalities should be\r\nallowed to install their own telephone systems in opposition to those of\r\nthe company. A select committee was appointed to consider this demand on\r\nthe question of \"whether the provision made for telephone service in\r\nlocal areas is adequate, and whether it is advisable to grant licences\r\nto local authorities or otherwise,\" but, owing to the dissolution of\r\nParliament, the committee did not present a report. Considerable\r\nevidence was heard, however, and the committee recommended that another\r\ncommittee should be appointed during the next session to consider and\r\nreport upon the evidence already taken and, if necessary, take more\r\nevidence. The witnesses examined were as a rule of the opinion that the\r\ntelephones should be taken over by the state; but there was a difference\r\nof opinion as to whether municipal licences should be granted.\r\nDissatisfaction with existing conditions seemed to be widespread. The\r\nGlasgow Corporation expressed disgust with the service of the company on\r\naccount of the difficulty of getting into communication with\r\nsubscribers, frequent interruptions and noises, and the chance of being\r\noverheard by a third party, the first complaint being due in their\r\nopinion to inadequate exchange accommodations, the second and third to\r\nthe one-wire system. The corporation was accused on the other hand of\r\nattempting to dislocate the company's system by refusing them permission\r\nto lay underground wires, while the overhead wires were unfavourably\r\naffected by the electric tramway currents. The Deputy Town Clerk of\r\nLiverpool was in favour of government telephones, but opposed municipal\r\nlicences on the ground that they would increase the expense of\r\ntelephoning between a municipal exchange and one belonging to the\r\ncompany. The London County Council advised that severe restrictions\r\nshould be laid upon the company by imposing maximum rates, etc., or that\r\nthe state should take over the company's system or that the municipality\r\nshould do so. Questions were sent to subscribers in London by the County\r\nCouncil, by the company, and by the Commissioner of Sewers, asking for\r\ntheir opinion on the service rendered by the company there. As may be\r\nimagined, the replies sent to the County Council and the Commissioner\r\nwere on the whole unfavourable to the company, while those sent to the\r\ncompany were generally favourable to them. It was shown that the number\r\nof subscribers in English and Scotch cities was fewer than in most\r\ncontinental cities, and that, comparing the population of the United\r\nKingdom with that of the United States, the number of subscribers in\r\nthe former should be about 145,000 instead of about 50,000; but nothing\r\nwas said of the superior postal and telegraphic facilities of the United\r\nKingdom as compared with the majority of foreign countries, facilities\r\nwhich would naturally reduce the demand for a comparatively new and in\r\nmany cases unpopular method of communication. The rate of the company in\r\nthe Metropolitan area for a business connection was £20 for a yearly\r\nagreement, with substantial reductions for second and additional\r\nconnections, and £12 for private houses. On a five years' agreement the\r\nrates were £17 and £10 respectively. The rate in Paris at the same time\r\nwas £16. For the provincial cities in England, such as Manchester,\r\nLiverpool, etc., the rate was £10 for a first connection and £8 10_s._\r\nfor second and additional connections, and for the large towns, such as\r\nNorwich, Chester, Exeter, etc., £8 within half a mile of the exchange,\r\n£9 within three quarters of a mile, £10 within one mile, and an\r\nadditional £2 10_s._ for each additional half-mile, with reductions for\r\nextra connections. For small outlying and isolated towns the half-mile\r\nrate was £6 10_s._, one mile £8, and £2 10_s._ for every additional\r\nhalf-mile.[832]\r\n\r\n[831] _Ibid._, 4th ser., iii, coll. 166 f.\r\n\r\n[832] _Rep. Com._, 1895, xiii, 350, pp. iii, 25-27, 60-62, 87, 90-91,\r\n163, 176, 221, 223, 275, 281-82, 321-22; _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., xxxi,\r\ncoll. 207 f.; xlviii, coll. 463-66.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, another committee was appointed with Mr. Hanbury as chairman,\r\n\"to enquire and report whether the telephone service was calculated to\r\nbecome of such general benefit as to justify its being undertaken by\r\nmunicipal and other authorities, regard being had to local finance.\" The\r\ncommittee were of the opinion that the existing telephone system was not\r\nof general benefit either in the kingdom at large or in those portions\r\nwhere exchanges existed, that it could hardly be of benefit so long as\r\nmonopolistic conditions existed, and that it was capable of becoming\r\nmuch more useful if worked solely or mainly with a view to the public\r\ninterest. They condemned the flat rate subscription charge of the\r\ncompany as of benefit only to the wealthier commercial classes in\r\nEnglish cities. They commented unfavourably upon the fact that in the\r\nLondon area there were only 237 call offices open to non-subscribers,\r\nand that as a rule messages could not be sent from them to subscribers\r\nexcept when the sender and recipient were in the same postal district\r\nor town, when the message might be delivered. They were of the opinion\r\nthat the telephones were far more useful in other countries where the\r\nconditions were not so favourable. Conditions, they thought, were\r\nunlikely to improve under the present management. The company must pay\r\ndividends on an inflated capital; its licence would expire in 1911, and\r\nthe Government was hardly likely to pay the company at that date for\r\ngoodwill. In addition, there were no restrictions on charges, the\r\ncompany had a motive for limiting its subscribers, as expenses increased\r\nproportionately with an increase in their number, and the question of\r\nway-leaves was a source of great difficulty. Finally, they declared in\r\nfavour of competition by the municipalities and the Post Office as\r\ntending to reduce rates, extend the system, and, if the Government\r\nshould eventually purchase the telephones, give alternative systems to\r\nchoose from. The Government adopted the committee's report, and, in a\r\nTreasury Minute of the 8th of May, 1899, laid down the principles upon\r\nwhich licences should be granted by the Postmaster-General to the\r\nmunicipalities, and announced that in London the Postmaster-General\r\nwould himself establish an exchange system.[833]\r\n\r\n[833] _Rep. Com._, 1898, xii, 383, pp. iii-xiii.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the finding of the committee and the resulting\r\nTreasury Minute, an act was passed in 1899, conferring upon the boroughs\r\nand borough districts to which the Postmaster-General might grant\r\nlicences the right to borrow money upon the security of the rates for\r\nthe erection and management of telephone systems. A loan of £2,000,000\r\nwas authorized for the use of the department itself in establishing\r\ntelephone competition with the company in London. The act also defined\r\nthe relations between the company and the municipalities (or other new\r\nlicencees) in the event of competition. If the telephone company would\r\nagree to abandon the power of discriminating between subscribers and\r\nwould consent to limit their charges within the maxima and minima\r\nprescribed by the Postmaster-General, the latter was to extend any\r\nway-leave rights already possessed for the period of the licence granted\r\nto the competing municipality or new licencee.\r\n\r\nIf the new licence were extended beyond 1911, the company's licence\r\nwould be likewise extended, but if their licence were extended for as\r\nmuch as eight years beyond 1911, the company were bound, at the request\r\nof the licencee and under certain conditions, to grant interchange of\r\ncommunication within the area. The new licences would be granted only to\r\nlocal authorities or companies approved by them, and the National\r\nCompany was prohibited from opening exchanges in any area in which they\r\nhad not, before the passing of the act, established an effective\r\nexchange. The effect of the act was to limit competition to the\r\nmunicipalities, to confine the National Company to those towns and areas\r\nthey were already serving, and to throw upon the Postmaster-General the\r\nduty of serving other parts of the country.[834]\r\n\r\n[834] 62 and 63 Vict., c. 38.\r\n\r\nThe form of the licences for municipalities, among other conditions,\r\ncontained provisions designed to secure for the public an efficient and\r\ncheap service. It was provided that the plant should be constructed in\r\naccordance with specifications prepared by the Postmaster-General, no\r\npreferential treatment should be allowed to any subscriber, the charges\r\nmade should be within certain specified limits, neither the licence nor\r\nany part of the plant of the licencee should be assigned to or\r\namalgamated with the business of any other licencee, and that the\r\nlicence might be terminated if an exchange system were not established\r\nwithin two years. The provisions of the agreement of 1896 which secured\r\ncoöperation between the Post Office and the National Company and\r\ncombined the telephone with the telegraph and postal services were also\r\nintroduced into the municipal licences. The municipalities were bound to\r\ngive intercommunication between their exchanges and any established by\r\nthe Postmaster-General, and terminal charges for trunk-wire\r\ncommunications between the exchange subscribers of any other system and\r\nthose of the local authority were forbidden. About sixty local\r\nauthorities made enquiries with a view to taking out licences, but only\r\nthirteen licences were accepted. That of Tunbridge Wells was surrendered\r\nin 1903, owing to an agreement arrived at between the National Telephone\r\nCompany and the corporation, the municipal telephones not having proved\r\na success.[835] In the case of seven others the licences were\r\nsurrendered or cancelled. The following corporations held licences in\r\n1905:--\r\n  Hull licence terminating 31st December, 1911\r\n  Glasgow                                 1913\r\n  Swansea                                 1920\r\n  Brighton                 30th April,    1926\r\n  Portsmouth                              1926\r\n\r\n[835] _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., cxxiv, coll. 781-82; cxv, col. 841; cxvi,\r\ncoll. 915-17.\r\n\r\nIn all the above cases except Hull, the National Telephone Company had\r\nagreed to forego the granting of special favours to subscribers, had\r\nestablished intercommunication, and their licence was accordingly\r\nextended in those places to the dates of termination of the corporation\r\nlicences. In Glasgow the National Telephone Company made several\r\napplications for permission to lay underground wires, but the\r\ncorporation refused the concession on any terms. In spite of this\r\nadvantage and the inability of the company to meet the low unlimited\r\nuser rate of the corporation telephones on account of agreements with\r\nsubscribers in other towns, the corporation found it advisable to sell\r\nits plant to the Post Office in 1906 for £305,000 at a capital loss of\r\nbetween £12,000 and £15,000. Brighton followed suit a little later for\r\nthe sum of £49,000, at a loss of £2450. Swansea experienced considerable\r\ndifficulty in borrowing money to extend its system on account of the\r\nrefusal of the Local Government Board to grant the necessary borrowing\r\npowers. The Post Office offered £22,000 for a plant which had cost\r\n£27,173. This offer was refused by the corporation, and an agreement was\r\nconcluded with the National Telephone Company in 1907 for the sale of\r\nthe plant at a price sufficient to repay the whole capital. Offers were\r\nalso made to Hull and Portsmouth by the department, but were refused, as\r\nthey were not sufficiently high to cover expenditure.[836]\r\n\r\n[836] _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., lxxxii, coll. 168-186; cliv, coll.\r\n1067-68; clxiv, col. 87; London _Times_, 1906, July 6, p. 10; 1907, Jan.\r\n3, p. 8; Feb. 9, p. 3; Mar. 22, p. 4.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the local authorities offered an initial flat rate lower than\r\nthat paid by the company's subscribers in competing centres, but most\r\nof the other rates of the corporation authorities were somewhat higher.\r\nThe service offered by the public telephones was not so satisfactory as\r\nhad been hoped, and the more numerous connections open to the company's\r\nsubscribers formed an initial advantage which it was difficult to\r\novercome. On the other hand, the corporations often had the advantage of\r\nunderground connections which were denied to the company, but the\r\nrelatively small number of the subscribers of the corporation\r\ntelephones, the high cost of underground connections, the clumsy service\r\noffered in many cases, and the ability of the company to offer lower\r\nrates in competitive areas proved too much for most of the corporations\r\nwhich were granted licences.[837]\r\n\r\n[837] _Rep. Com._, 1905, vii, 271, pp. 10, 76, 79, 233-235.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the National Telephone Company had been experiencing\r\nconsiderable difficulty in getting permission to lay underground wires\r\nin London. In 1892, the Telegraph act of that year authorized the\r\nPostmaster-General to grant to his licencees the same way-leave powers\r\nwhich he enjoyed, subject to the conditions that the licencees should\r\nnot exercise such powers in London without the consent of the County\r\nCouncil, nor in any urban district outside London without the consent of\r\nthe urban authority, nor elsewhere without the consent of the County\r\nCouncil. In pursuance of this authority the Postmaster-General, in the\r\nagreement of the 25th of March, 1896, undertook, at the request of the\r\ncompany, to authorize them to exercise his way-leave powers in any\r\nexchange area. The company did not apply for the exercise of such\r\nauthority in London, but an attempt was made by them to obtain the\r\nconsent of the London County Council to allow their wires to be placed\r\nunderground, and the work proceeded with the permission of the local\r\nroad authorities in London. Negotiations with the council were\r\nfruitless, largely on account of the price asked for way-leave and the\r\ndemand for lower rates. The Postmaster-General was advised that it was\r\nhis duty to see that the act of 1892 was enforced, and the resulting\r\ncorrespondence with the company having failed of any satisfactory\r\nresult, an information in the name of the Attorney-General was filed\r\nagainst the company, asking for a declaration that they were not\r\nentitled to proceed with their underground works in London without the\r\nauthority of the Postmaster-General and the consent of the County\r\nCouncil. An order to that effect was made on the 24th of July, 1900.\r\nThis seemed a favourable opportunity for the Postmaster-General to\r\nsecure from the company certain concessions with reference to their\r\nLondon exchange system as well as privileges for the subscribers of the\r\npostal exchanges which had been established in London and an agreement\r\nwith reference to the purchase in 1911 by the Post Office of the\r\ncompany's London exchanges. These concessions and privileges were\r\nfinally embodied in an agreement made on the 18th of November, 1901, by\r\nwhich the Postmaster-General agreed to furnish such underground wires on\r\nthe demand of the company as he might think reasonable and likely to be\r\nuseful to the Post Office later, as well as underground wires connecting\r\nthe exchanges of the Post Office with those of the company. When the\r\nsubscribers of the London Postal Exchanges exceeded 10,000 in number,\r\nthe company agreed to pay half of the rent of the latter wires. No\r\nterminal charges were payable for a message passing over these wires, or\r\nfor a message over the trunk lines between the subscribers of the Post\r\nOffice in London and those outside London, or between subscribers of the\r\ncompany in London and those outside London. In addition, the\r\nPostmaster-General promised to afford to the company's subscribers in\r\nLondon all such facilities with reference to postal, telegraphic, and\r\ntelephonic communications as he granted to Post Office London\r\nsubscribers and upon the same terms and conditions. He also agreed to\r\nconsider all applications from the company for way-leaves on railways\r\nand canals where he enjoyed such rights, and the company promised to\r\nestablish telephone communications without favour or preference. A\r\ndecision was also reached fixing equal rates for the postal and\r\ncompany's subscribers in London, based primarily on the number of\r\nmessages sent with an unmeasured rate lower than that previously in\r\nforce, no revision to be made without six months' notice being given.\r\nFinally it was agreed that in 1911 or before--if the company's licence\r\nshould have been previously revoked--the Postmaster-General should buy\r\nand the company should sell at its fair market value all such plant as\r\nshould then be in use by the company in London and be suitable for the\r\nPost Office at that date. None of the plant was to be considered\r\nsuitable unless installed with the written consent of the\r\nPostmaster-General, the question of suitability to be decided by\r\narbitration if necessary.[838] The local authorities protested in vain\r\nagainst the agreement, their contention being that the committee of\r\ninvestigation had advised competition, whereas the government had on the\r\nother hand succeeded only in making very unsatisfactory terms with the\r\ncompany.[839]\r\n\r\n[838] _Acc. & P._, 1902, lv, 25, pp. 4-10; _Rep. Com._, 1905, vii, 271,\r\npp. 1-3, 53-54, 233-235; _Parl. Deb._, 4th ser., lxxxii, coll. 183; ci,\r\ncoll. 1002-03; cxxxii, coll. 422.\r\n\r\n[839] _Ibid._, 4th ser., ci, coll. 976-993.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, the Postmaster-General and the National Telephone Company\r\nconcluded an agreement for the purchase of the company's provincial\r\nplant based upon much the same principles which had governed the London\r\nagreement. The question of purchase in the provinces was complicated by\r\nthe fact that in some towns there were competing municipal telephones, a\r\nresulting duplication of plant, and an extension of the licence period\r\nbeyond 1911. By the terms of the agreement, the Postmaster-General on\r\nthe 31st of December, 1911, shall buy and the National Telephone Company\r\nshall sell (_a_) \"all the plant, land, and buildings of the company\r\nbrought into use with the sanction of the Postmaster-General and in use\r\non the 31st of December, 1911, for the purpose of the telephonic\r\nbusiness of the Company, (_b_) any licensed business of the company in\r\ntowns where there are municipal exchanges and where the licence extends\r\nbeyond 1911, (_c_) the private wire business of the company (for which\r\nno licence is required) in use after the 31st of December, 1911, with\r\nbuildings, plant, etc., (_d._) all stores and buildings suitable for use\r\nin accordance with specifications contained in the agreement, (_e_) all\r\nspare plant and works under construction if suitable for the telephonic\r\nbusiness of the Post Office.\" The plant, land, and buildings were deemed\r\nto be brought into use with the sanction of the Postmaster-General if\r\nthey were in use or being brought into use at the date of the agreement;\r\nin the case of plant to be installed, if constructed in accordance with\r\nspecifications contained in the agreement and of land and buildings, if\r\nacquired or constructed with the consent of the Postmaster-General. With\r\nreference to plant not constructed in accordance with the\r\nspecifications, and plant and buildings of any kind in competitive\r\nareas, the Postmaster-General reserved the right to object to buy such\r\nplant or buildings, the question of suitability in competitive areas to\r\nbe settled by arbitration. The value to be paid for the company's\r\nundertaking, not in the competitive areas and not being private wire\r\nbusiness, shall be the value on the date of purchase exclusive of any\r\nallowance for past or future profits or any consideration for compulsory\r\nsale or any other consideration. The value in competitive areas is to be\r\ndetermined by agreement, regard being had to net profits and to the\r\ncircumstances and conditions under which the company would carry on such\r\nbusiness after the date of sale. The value of the private wire business\r\n(apart from the plant, land, and buildings used therein) is to be three\r\nyears purchase of the net profits on the average of the three years\r\nending 31st of December, 1911. Any other property or assets of the\r\ncompany may be purchased by the Postmaster-General, the price to be\r\ndetermined by arbitration, if necessary, and, after the date of sale,\r\nthe telegraphic business of the company will be carried on (whether by\r\nthe company or the Postmaster-General) at the expense and for the\r\nbenefit of the Postmaster-General. In the meantime the company agreed to\r\nmaintain its plant in good and efficient working order, not to show\r\nfavour or preference among its subscribers, to accept minimum and\r\nmaximum rates, to allow intercommunication without terminal charges\r\nbetween their and the Post Office subscribers in the same area, and not\r\nto collect terminal charges for messages sent over the trunk lines\r\nbetween subscribers of the company and those of the Post Office. The\r\nPostmaster-General agreed to extend to subscribers of the company all\r\nsuch telegraphic and postal facilities as his own subscribers enjoyed,\r\nand to undertake underground works for the company elsewhere than in\r\nLondon under the same conditions as in London. An agreement was also\r\nreached that similar rates should be charged where the\r\nPostmaster-General and the company maintained competing systems. As a\r\nresult, measured rates were, as a rule, substituted for the old flat\r\nrates, much to the indignation of various Chambers of Commerce in the\r\nKingdom. In the case of complaint as to inefficient service, if the\r\ncharge is held to be proved before a person appointed by the Board of\r\nTrade, and if it is not the result of a refusal to grant way-leaves, the\r\nPostmaster-General may require the company to remedy conditions in the\r\nparticular area concerned or may call upon them to sell the inefficient\r\nsystem to him. In the first case if there is no improvement or if the\r\nsecond alternative has been adopted, the Postmaster-General may require\r\nimmediate sale under the same terms that would have held if it had not\r\ntaken place until the 31st of December, 1911.[840]\r\n\r\n[840] _Acc. & P._, 1905, xliv, 16, pp. 3-23; _Rep. Com._, 1905, vii,\r\n271, pp. iii-xi.\r\n\r\nThe income received by the Post Office for the fiscal year 1906-07 from\r\nthe London and provincial exchanges and trunk-line business was\r\n£908,246, working expenses, £456,459, balance for depreciation,\r\ninterest, etc., £451,787, leaving a balance of £19,061 over and above an\r\nestimated amount of £432,726 for depreciation and interest at three per\r\ncent on the capital expenditure. The London exchange, with a gross\r\nincome of £330,512, showed a surplus of £25,586 over and above\r\ndepreciation fund and interest on capital expenditure, the provincial\r\nexchanges a deficit of £15,758, and the trunk lines a surplus of £9333.\r\nThe number of subscribers to the Post Office provincial exchanges\r\n(excluding Glasgow and Brighton) was 10,010. Including the Glasgow\r\nsubscribers (11,103) and the Brighton subscribers (1542), the total was\r\n22,655. Arrangements were then being made for local intercommunication\r\nbetween subscribers of these exchanges and those of the company in the\r\nsame places. Hull and Portsmouth were the only towns maintaining\r\nmunicipal telephonic systems in 1907, Hull having 2128 telephones in use\r\nand Portsmouth 2553. The number of telephones in the London Post Office\r\ntelephone service was 41,236, including 425 public call offices. The\r\nagreement of 1905, providing for similar rates in the provinces between\r\nexchanges of the Post Office and those of the company, was followed\r\nafter considerable discussion by the announcement of the adoption of a\r\nnew scale in May, 1906. The rates are now based on the principle of a\r\nmeasured service under which each subscriber pays according to the\r\nquality and quantity of the service desired. He may contract for any\r\nnumber of calls from four hundred upward, and he may share a line with\r\nanother subscriber at a reduced rate, or he may rent a line for his own\r\nexclusive use.[841]\r\n\r\n[841] _Rep.

Organized at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century as a means for the conveyance of\r\nstate letters, its messengers, by tacit consent, were allowed to carry\r\nthe letters of private individuals. The advantage so afforded for the\r\ncontrol of seditious correspondence led to the monopolistic\r\nproclamations of the closing years of the sixteenth and the opening\r\nyears of the seventeenth century. Before 1635 the state obtained no\r\ndirect revenue for the conveyance of private letters. The messengers or\r\npostmen who were supposed to be paid by the state, derived the larger\r\npart of their income from the postage on these letters and from letting\r\nhorses to travellers.\r\n\r\nThe object in retaining for the Royal Posts the sole right to carry the\r\nletters of private individuals assumed a new form in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Witherings showed that by diverting the postage on private\r\nletters from the postmen to the state the Post Office might be made\r\nself-supporting. Legal rates were imposed, letters were carried at a\r\nmuch higher speed, and the system of packet posts was extended over the\r\ngreat roads of England. The supervision of private correspondence became\r\na matter of only secondary importance. The struggle between the King and\r\nParliament resulted in securing popular control over the posts of the\r\nkingdom. At the same time, during the political unrest, competing\r\nsystems of posts were repressed with difficulty. The inability of\r\ngovernment officials to meet the increasing needs of a growing\r\nmetropolis led to the establishment of a Penny Post in London by\r\nDockwra, a private individual.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the eighteenth century saw the extension of a postal\r\nsystem in the colonies and an attempt on the part of the Post Office to\r\nobtain the postage on letters passing over the cross-roads of England.\r\nThe increase in England's colonial possessions and her growing trade\r\nwith foreign countries produced a corresponding growth in the packet\r\nservice. The last part of the century saw the establishment of Palmer's\r\nmail coaches in order to meet competition from the post coaches. The\r\ngreat increase in revenue which accompanied the industrial revolution\r\nled to corruption among the postal officials, resulting in the reform of\r\n1793. The period of rapid growth had passed, and the close of the\r\neighteenth century was a period of consolidation for the new offices\r\nwhich had been created, and better coöperation in the work which they\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe first forty years of the last century saw the Post Office at its\r\nbest as an instrument of taxation. But this very fact drew attention to\r\nthe lack of other and more important objects. Rates had been forced so\r\nhigh that people resorted to legal and illegal means to evade paying\r\nthem. The feeling was growing that a tax upon correspondence was not\r\nonly a poor method of raising money but that its ulterior effect in\r\nrestricting letter writing was producing undesirable results upon the\r\npeople of England industrially and socially. A great mistake had been\r\nmade by the Post Office in acquiring steam packets. They suffered\r\nseverely from private competing lines and were always a loss to the\r\nGovernment. A partial remedy was attained by the transfer of all the\r\npackets to the Admiralty. Eventually the popular cause, championed by\r\nHill and Wallace, forced itself upon the attention of the Government. A\r\nParliamentary committee, after listening to the evidence of\r\nrepresentative witnesses, declared itself in favour of low and uniform\r\nrates of postage for the United Kingdom, the result being the adoption\r\nof inland Penny Postage in 1840.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous changes which have characterized the development of\r\nthe Post Office since 1840 are the successive reductions in rates; the\r\ntransfer of the packet boats from the Admiralty, followed by the\r\nresolution of the Government to revert to the old principle of depending\r\nupon private enterprise for the sea carriage of the mails; the extension\r\nin the use of the railways as a medium of conveyance; the establishment\r\nof a parcel post; and the decision of the government to provide banking\r\nand assurance facilities for the thrifty person of small means. But the\r\ngreatest departure in the field of the department's activities has been\r\nthe acquisition of the telegraphic system of the Kingdom. Misled by\r\ntheir advisers as to the capital cost and induced by popular pressure to\r\nabandon strictly business methods of administration and extension, the\r\ntelegraphic experiments of the department have not been a financial\r\nsuccess. Not only has this been the case, but, in their efforts to\r\nprotect the revenue, successive Governments have hindered the\r\ndevelopment of telephonic communication. At this late date we can safely\r\nassume that in 1870 the department should either have granted the\r\ntelephone companies far greater powers or should themselves have assumed\r\nthe burden of providing an adequate system of telephonic communication.\r\nIn 1911, the property and franchises of the telephone companies will\r\npass to the control of the Government, thus vastly increasing the work\r\nof the department if, as seems probable, the Government should assume\r\ndirect management, and greatly enlarging the number of dissatisfied\r\nmembers of that part of the civil service under the control of the Post\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     APPENDIX\r\n\r\n         EXPENDITURE AND REVENUE TABLES\r\n\r\n                      TABLE I\r\n\r\n\r\n  GROSS PRODUCT,

The \"Proceedings and Ordinances and the Acts of\r\nthe Privy Council\" contain important orders issued to the\r\nPostmaster-General or the postmen during the sixteenth century as well\r\nas complaints from the postmen and the public. From the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century the chief sources of information are the historical\r\nsummaries appended to the \"Reports of Committees and Commissioners\"\r\ncompiled during the first half of the nineteenth century. Of these, the\r\n\"Report of 1844\" is the most important. The \"Journals of the Lords and\r\nCommons\" throw some light upon the history, purpose, and intent of the\r\nvarious acts of Parliament dealing with rates and finance. \"The\r\nFinancial Report of 1797,\" various returns submitted to the House of\r\nCommons, and the reports contained in the \"Accounts and Papers\" for the\r\nfirst part of the nineteenth century are chiefly concerned with the\r\nfinancial side of the history of the British Post Office. Since 1840 the\r\nmost important sources of information are the yearly reports of the\r\nPostmasters-General, dating from 1854, and the voluminous reports of\r\ncommittees appointed to investigate debated points in the organization\r\nand policy of the Post Office as well as to advise upon matters which\r\nhad produced friction between the department and its employees.\r\n\r\nOf the secondary works there is little to be said. The only one from\r\nwhich any important information has been obtained is Joyce's \"History of\r\nthe British Post Office to 1836.\" This book contains a great deal of\r\nvaluable matter arranged in rather a haphazard fashion and with no\r\nreferences. Writing as a Post Office official at the end of the\r\nnineteenth century, Joyce hardly appreciated the conditions which his\r\npredecessors had to meet. In Stow's \"London\" are found some interesting\r\nfacts about the London Penny Post, in Blomefield's \"Norfolk\" early\r\npostal conditions in Norwich are described. The other books of the same\r\ndescription contain only incidental references to minor points of Post\r\nOffice development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abuses
