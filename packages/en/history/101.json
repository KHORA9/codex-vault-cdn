Computer crimes--United States.\r\n2.  Telephone--United States--Corrupt practices.\r\n3.  Programming (Electronic computers)--United States--Corrupt practices.\"\r\n\r\n`Corrupt practices,' I always get a kick out of that description.\r\nLibrarians are very ingenious people.\r\n\r\nThe paperback is ISBN 0-553-56370-X.  If you go\r\nand buy a print version of The Hacker Crackdown,\r\nan action I encourage heartily, you may notice that\r\nin the front of the book, beneath the copyright notice--\r\n\"Copyright (C) 1992 by Bruce Sterling\"--\r\nit has this little block of printed legal\r\nboilerplate from the publisher.  It says, and I quote:\r\n\r\n \"No part of this book may be reproduced or transmitted in any form\r\nor by any means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopying,\r\nrecording, or by any information storage and retrieval system,\r\nwithout permission in writing from the publisher.\r\nFor information address:  Bantam Books.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty good disclaimer, as such disclaimers go.\r\nI collect intellectual-property disclaimers, and I've seen dozens of them,\r\nand this one is at least pretty straightforward.  In this narrow\r\nand particular case, however, it isn't quite accurate.\r\nBantam Books puts that disclaimer on every book they publish,\r\nbut Bantam Books does not, in fact, own the electronic rights to this book.\r\nI do, because of certain extensive contract maneuverings my agent and I\r\nwent through before this book was written.  I want to give those electronic\r\npublishing rights away through certain not-for-profit channels,\r\nand I've convinced Bantam that this is a good idea.\r\n\r\nSince Bantam has seen fit to peacably agree to this scheme of mine,\r\nBantam Books is not going to fuss about this.  Provided you don't try\r\nto sell the book, they are not going to bother you for what you do with\r\nthe electronic copy of this book.  If you want to check this out personally,\r\nyou can ask them; they're at 1540 Broadway NY NY 10036.  However, if you were\r\nso foolish as to print this book and start retailing it for money in violation\r\nof my copyright and the commercial interests of Bantam Books, then Bantam,\r\na part of the gigantic Bertelsmann multinational publishing combine,\r\nwould roust some of their heavy-duty attorneys out of hibernation\r\nand crush you like a bug.  This is only to be expected.\r\nI didn't write this book so that you could make money out of it.\r\nIf anybody is gonna make money out of this book,\r\nit's gonna be me and my publisher.\r\n\r\nMy publisher deserves to make money out of this book.\r\nNot only did the folks at Bantam Books commission me\r\nto write the book, and pay me a hefty sum to do so, but\r\nthey bravely printed, in text, an electronic document the\r\nreproduction of which was once alleged to be a federal felony.\r\nBantam Books and their numerous attorneys were very brave\r\nand forthright about this book.  Furthermore, my former editor\r\nat Bantam Books, Betsy Mitchell, genuinely cared about this project,\r\nand worked hard on it, and had a lot of wise things to say\r\nabout the manuscript.  Betsy deserves genuine credit for this book,\r\ncredit that editors too rarely get.\r\n\r\nThe critics were very kind to The Hacker Crackdown,\r\nand commercially the book has done well.  On the other hand,\r\nI didn't write this book in order to squeeze every last nickel\r\nand dime out of the mitts of impoverished sixteen-year-old\r\ncyberpunk high-school-students.  Teenagers don't have any money--\r\n(no, not even enough for the six-dollar Hacker Crackdown paperback,\r\nwith its attractive bright-red cover and useful index).\r\nThat's a major reason why teenagers sometimes succumb to the temptation\r\nto do things they shouldn't, such as swiping my books out of libraries.\r\nKids:  this one is all yours, all right?  Go give the print version back.\r\n*8-)\r\n\r\nWell-meaning, public-spirited civil libertarians don't have much money,\r\neither.  And it seems almost criminal to snatch cash out of the hands of\r\nAmerica's direly underpaid electronic law enforcement community.\r\n\r\nIf you're a computer cop, a hacker, or an electronic civil\r\nliberties activist, you are the target audience for this book.\r\nI wrote this book because I wanted to help you, and help other people\r\nunderstand you and your unique, uhm, problems.  I wrote this book\r\nto aid your activities, and to contribute to the public discussion\r\nof important political issues.  In giving the text away in this\r\nfashion, I am directly contributing to the book's ultimate aim:\r\nto help civilize cyberspace.\r\n\r\nInformation WANTS to be free.  And  the information inside\r\nthis book longs for freedom with a peculiar intensity.\r\nI genuinely believe that the natural habitat of this book\r\nis inside an electronic network.  That may not be the easiest\r\ndirect method to generate revenue for the book's author,\r\nbut that doesn't matter; this is where this book belongs\r\nby its nature.  I've written other books--plenty of other books--\r\nand I'll write more and I am writing more, but this one is special.\r\nI am making The Hacker Crackdown available electronically\r\nas widely as I can conveniently manage, and if you like the book,\r\nand think it is useful, then I urge you to do the same with it.\r\n\r\nYou can copy this electronic book.  Copy the heck out of it,\r\nbe my guest, and give those copies to anybody who wants them.\r\nThe nascent world of cyberspace is full of sysadmins, teachers,\r\ntrainers, cybrarians, netgurus, and various species of cybernetic activist.\r\nIf you're one of those people, I know about you, and I know the hassle\r\nyou go through to try to help people learn about the electronic frontier.\r\nI hope that possessing this book in electronic form will lessen your troubles.\r\nGranted, this treatment of our electronic social spectrum is not the ultimate\r\nin academic rigor.  And politically, it has something to offend\r\nand trouble almost everyone.  But hey, I'm told it's readable,\r\nand at least the price is right.\r\n\r\nYou can upload the book onto bulletin board systems, or Internet nodes,\r\nor electronic discussion groups.  Go right ahead and do that, I am giving\r\nyou express permission right now.  Enjoy yourself.\r\n\r\nYou can put the book on disks and give the disks away,\r\nas long as you don't take any money for it.\r\n\r\nBut this book is not public domain.  You can't copyright it in\r\nyour own name.  I own the copyright.  Attempts to pirate this book\r\nand make money from selling it may involve you in a serious litigative snarl.\r\nBelieve me, for the pittance you might wring out of such an action,\r\nit's really not worth it.  This book don't \"belong\" to you.\r\nIn an odd but very genuine way, I feel it doesn't \"belong\" to me, either.\r\nIt's a book about the people of cyberspace, and distributing it in this way\r\nis the best way I know to actually make this information available,\r\nfreely and easily, to all the people of cyberspace--including people\r\nfar outside the borders of the United States, who otherwise may never\r\nhave a chance to see any edition of the book, and who may perhaps learn\r\nsomething useful from this strange story of distant, obscure, but portentous\r\nevents in so-called \"American cyberspace.\"\r\n\r\nThis electronic book is now literary freeware.  It now belongs to the\r\nemergent realm of alternative information economics.  You have no right\r\nto make this electronic book part of the conventional flow of commerce.\r\nLet it be part of the flow of knowledge: there's a difference.\r\nI've divided the book into four sections, so that it is less ungainly\r\nfor upload and download; if there's a section of particular relevance\r\nto you and your colleagues, feel free to reproduce that one and skip the rest.\r\n\r\n[Project Gutenberg has reassembled the file, with Sterling's permission.]\r\n\r\nJust make more when you need them, and give them to whoever might want them.\r\n\r\nNow have fun.\r\n\r\nBruce Sterling--bruces@well.sf.ca.us\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HACKER CRACKDOWN\r\n\r\nLaw and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier\r\n\r\nby Bruce Sterling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY OF THE HACKER CRACKDOWN\r\n\r\n\r\n1865  U.S. Secret Service (USSS) founded.\r\n\r\n1876  Alexander Graham Bell invents telephone.\r\n\r\n1878  First teenage males flung off phone system by enraged authorities.\r\n\r\n1939  \"Futurian\" science-fiction group raided by Secret Service.\r\n\r\n1971  Yippie phone phreaks start YIPL/TAP magazine.\r\n\r\n1972  RAMPARTS magazine seized in blue-box rip-off scandal.\r\n\r\n1978  Ward Christenson and Randy Suess create first personal\r\n      computer bulletin board system.\r\n\r\n1982  William Gibson coins term \"cyberspace.\"\r\n\r\n1982  \"414 Gang\" raided.\r\n\r\n1983-1983  AT&T dismantled in divestiture.\r\n\r\n1984  Congress passes Comprehensive Crime Control Act giving USSS\r\n      jurisdiction over credit card fraud and computer fraud.\r\n\r\n1984  \"Legion of Doom\" formed.\r\n\r\n1984.  2600:  THE HACKER QUARTERLY founded.\r\n\r\n1984.

Cyberspace is the \"place\" where\r\na telephone conversation appears to occur.  Not inside your actual phone,\r\nthe plastic device on your desk.  Not inside the other person's phone,\r\nin some other city.  THE PLACE BETWEEN the phones.  The indefinite\r\nplace OUT THERE, where the two of you, two human beings,\r\nactually meet and communicate.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not exactly  \"real,\" \"cyberspace\" is a genuine place.\r\nThings happen there that have very genuine consequences.  This \"place\"\r\nis not \"real,\" but it is serious, it is earnest.  Tens of thousands\r\nof people have dedicated their lives to it, to the public service\r\nof public communication by wire and electronics.\r\n\r\nPeople have worked on this \"frontier\" for generations now.\r\nSome people became rich and famous from their efforts there.\r\nSome just played in it, as hobbyists.  Others soberly pondered it,\r\nand wrote about it, and regulated it, and negotiated over it in\r\ninternational forums, and sued one another about it, in gigantic,\r\nepic court battles that lasted for years.  And almost since\r\nthe beginning, some people have committed crimes in this place.\r\n\r\nBut in the past twenty years, this electrical \"space,\"\r\nwhich was once thin and dark and one-dimensional--little more\r\nthan a narrow speaking-tube, stretching from phone to phone--\r\nhas flung itself open like a gigantic jack-in-the-box.\r\nLight has flooded upon it, the eerie light of the glowing computer screen.\r\nThis dark electric netherworld has become a vast flowering electronic landscape.\r\nSince the 1960s, the world of the telephone has cross-bred itself\r\nwith computers and television, and though there is still no substance\r\nto cyberspace, nothing you can handle, it has a strange kind\r\nof physicality now.  It makes good sense today to talk of cyberspace\r\nas a place all its own.\r\n\r\nBecause people live in it now.  Not just a few people,\r\nnot just a few technicians and eccentrics, but thousands\r\nof people, quite normal people.  And not just for a little while,\r\neither, but for hours straight, over weeks, and  months,\r\nand years.  Cyberspace today is a \"Net,\" a \"Matrix,\"\r\ninternational in scope and growing swiftly and steadily.\r\nIt's growing in size, and wealth, and  political importance.\r\n\r\nPeople are making entire careers in modern cyberspace.\r\nScientists and technicians, of course; they've been there\r\nfor twenty years now.  But increasingly, cyberspace\r\nis filling with journalists and doctors and lawyers\r\nand artists and clerks.  Civil servants make their\r\ncareers there now, \"on-line\" in vast government data-banks;\r\nand so do spies, industrial, political, and just plain snoops;\r\nand so do police, at least a few of them.  And there are children\r\nliving there now.\r\n\r\nPeople have met there and been married there.\r\nThere are entire living communities in cyberspace today;\r\nchattering, gossiping, planning, conferring and scheming,\r\nleaving one another voice-mail and electronic mail,\r\ngiving one another big weightless chunks of valuable data,\r\nboth legitimate and illegitimate.  They busily pass one another\r\ncomputer software and the occasional festering computer virus.\r\n\r\nWe do not really understand how to live in cyberspace yet.\r\nWe are feeling our way into it, blundering about.\r\nThat is not surprising.  Our lives in the physical world,\r\nthe \"real\" world, are also far from perfect, despite a lot more practice.\r\nHuman lives, real lives, are imperfect by their nature, and there are\r\nhuman beings in cyberspace.  The way we live in cyberspace is\r\na funhouse mirror of the way we live in the real world.\r\nWe take both our advantages and our troubles with us.\r\n\r\nThis book is about trouble in cyberspace.\r\nSpecifically, this book is about certain strange events in\r\nthe year 1990, an unprecedented and startling year for the\r\nthe growing world of computerized communications.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 there came a nationwide crackdown on illicit\r\ncomputer hackers, with arrests, criminal charges,\r\none dramatic show-trial, several guilty pleas, and\r\nhuge confiscations of data and equipment all over the USA.\r\n\r\nThe Hacker Crackdown of 1990 was larger, better organized,\r\nmore deliberate, and more resolute than any previous effort\r\nin the brave new world of computer crime.  The U.S. Secret Service,\r\nprivate telephone security, and state and local law enforcement groups\r\nacross the country all joined forces in a determined attempt to break\r\nthe back of America's electronic underground.  It was a fascinating\r\neffort, with very mixed results.\r\n\r\nThe Hacker Crackdown had another unprecedented effect;\r\nit spurred the creation, within \"the computer community,\"\r\nof the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a new and very odd\r\ninterest group, fiercely  dedicated to the establishment\r\nand preservation of electronic civil liberties.  The crackdown,\r\nremarkable in itself, has created a melee of debate over electronic crime,\r\npunishment, freedom of the press, and issues of search and seizure.\r\nPolitics has entered cyberspace.  Where people go, politics follow.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the people of cyberspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART ONE:  Crashing the System\r\n\r\nOn January 15, 1990, AT&T's long-distance telephone switching system crashed.\r\n\r\nThis was a strange, dire, huge event.  Sixty thousand people lost\r\ntheir telephone service completely.  During the nine long hours\r\nof frantic effort that it took to restore service, some seventy million\r\ntelephone calls went uncompleted.\r\n\r\nLosses of service, known as \"outages\" in the telco trade,\r\nare a known and accepted hazard of the telephone business.\r\nHurricanes hit, and phone cables get snapped by the thousands.\r\nEarthquakes wrench through buried fiber-optic lines.\r\nSwitching stations catch fire and burn to the ground.\r\nThese things do happen.  There are contingency plans for them,\r\nand decades of experience in dealing with them.\r\nBut the Crash of January 15 was unprecedented.\r\nIt was unbelievably huge, and it occurred for\r\nno apparent physical reason.\r\n\r\nThe crash started  on a Monday afternoon in a single\r\nswitching-station in Manhattan.  But, unlike any merely\r\nphysical damage, it spread and spread.  Station after\r\nstation across America collapsed in a chain reaction,\r\nuntil fully half of AT&T's network had gone haywire\r\nand the remaining half was hard-put to handle the overflow.\r\n\r\nWithin nine hours, AT&T software engineers more or less\r\nunderstood what had caused the crash.  Replicating the\r\nproblem exactly, poring over software line by line,\r\ntook them a couple of weeks.  But because it was hard\r\nto understand technically, the full truth of the matter\r\nand its implications were not widely and thoroughly aired\r\nand explained.  The root cause of the crash remained obscure,\r\nsurrounded by rumor and fear.\r\n\r\nThe crash was a grave corporate embarrassment.\r\nThe \"culprit\" was a bug in AT&T's own software--not the\r\nsort of admission the telecommunications giant wanted\r\nto make, especially in the face of increasing competition.\r\nStill, the truth WAS told, in the baffling technical terms\r\nnecessary to explain it.\r\n\r\nSomehow the explanation failed to persuade\r\nAmerican law enforcement officials and even telephone\r\ncorporate security personnel.  These people were not\r\ntechnical experts or software wizards, and they had their\r\nown suspicions about the cause of this disaster.\r\n\r\nThe police and telco security had important sources\r\nof information denied to mere software engineers.\r\nThey had informants in the computer underground and\r\nyears of experience in dealing with high-tech rascality\r\nthat seemed to grow ever more sophisticated.\r\nFor years they had been expecting a direct and\r\nsavage attack against the American national telephone system.\r\nAnd with the Crash of January 15--the first month of a\r\nnew, high-tech decade--their predictions, fears,\r\nand suspicions seemed at last to have entered the real world.\r\nA world where the telephone system had not merely crashed,\r\nbut, quite likely, BEEN crashed--by \"hackers.\"\r\n\r\nThe  crash created a large dark cloud of suspicion\r\nthat would color certain people's assumptions and actions\r\nfor months.  The fact that it took place in the realm of\r\nsoftware was suspicious on its face.  The fact that it\r\noccurred on Martin Luther King Day, still the most\r\npolitically touchy of American holidays, made it more\r\nsuspicious yet.\r\n\r\nThe  Crash of January 15  gave the Hacker Crackdown\r\nits sense of edge and its sweaty urgency.  It made people,\r\npowerful people in positions of public authority,\r\nwilling to believe the worst.  And, most fatally,\r\nit helped to give investigators a willingness\r\nto take extreme measures and the determination\r\nto preserve almost total secrecy.\r\n\r\nAn obscure software fault in an aging switching system\r\nin New York was to lead to a chain reaction of legal\r\nand constitutional trouble all across the country.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLike the crash in the telephone system, this chain reaction\r\nwas ready and waiting to happen.  During the 1980s,\r\nthe American legal system was extensively patched\r\nto deal with the novel issues of computer crime.\r\nThere was, for instance, the Electronic Communications\r\nPrivacy Act of 1986  (eloquently described as \"a stinking mess\"\r\nby a prominent law enforcement official).  And there was the\r\ndraconian Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, passed unanimously\r\nby the United States Senate, which later would reveal\r\na large number of flaws.  Extensive, well-meant efforts\r\nhad been made to keep the legal system up to date.\r\nBut in the day-to-day grind of the real world,\r\neven the most elegant software tends to crumble\r\nand suddenly reveal its hidden bugs.\r\n\r\nLike the advancing telephone system, the American legal system\r\nwas certainly not ruined by its temporary crash; but for those\r\ncaught under the weight of the collapsing system, life became\r\na series of blackouts and anomalies.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand why these weird events occurred,\r\nboth in the world of technology and in the world of law,\r\nit's not enough to understand the merely technical problems.\r\nWe will get to those; but first and foremost, we must try\r\nto understand the telephone, and the business of telephones,\r\nand the community of human beings that telephones have created.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nTechnologies have life cycles, like cities do,\r\nlike institutions do, like laws and governments do.\r\n\r\nThe first stage of any technology is the Question\r\nMark, often known as the \"Golden Vaporware\" stage.\r\nAt this early point, the technology is only a phantom,\r\na mere gleam in the inventor's eye.  One such inventor\r\nwas a speech teacher and electrical tinkerer named\r\nAlexander Graham Bell.\r\n\r\nBell's early inventions, while ingenious, failed to move the world.\r\nIn 1863, the teenage Bell and his brother Melville made an artificial\r\ntalking mechanism out of wood, rubber, gutta-percha, and tin.\r\nThis weird device had a rubber-covered \"tongue\" made of movable\r\nwooden segments, with vibrating rubber \"vocal cords,\" and\r\nrubber \"lips\" and \"cheeks.\"  While Melville puffed a bellows\r\ninto a tin tube, imitating the lungs, young Alec  Bell would\r\nmanipulate the \"lips,\" \"teeth,\" and \"tongue,\" causing the thing\r\nto emit high-pitched falsetto gibberish.\r\n\r\nAnother would-be technical breakthrough was the Bell \"phonautograph\"\r\nof 1874, actually made out of a human cadaver's ear.  Clamped into place\r\non a tripod, this grisly gadget drew sound-wave images on smoked glass\r\nthrough a thin straw glued to its vibrating earbones.\r\n\r\nBy 1875, Bell had learned to produce audible sounds--ugly shrieks\r\nand squawks--by using magnets, diaphragms, and electrical current.\r\n\r\nMost \"Golden Vaporware\" technologies go nowhere.\r\n\r\nBut the second stage of technology is the Rising Star,\r\nor, the \"Goofy Prototype,\" stage.  The telephone, Bell's\r\nmost ambitious gadget yet, reached this stage on March\r\n10, 1876.  On that great day, Alexander Graham Bell\r\nbecame the first person to transmit intelligible human\r\nspeech electrically.  As it happened, young Professor Bell,\r\nindustriously tinkering in his Boston lab, had spattered\r\nhis trousers with acid.  His assistant, Mr. Watson,\r\nheard his cry for help--over Bell's experimental\r\naudio-telegraph.  This was an event without precedent.\r\n\r\nTechnologies in their \"Goofy Prototype\" stage rarely\r\nwork very well.  They're experimental, and therefore\r\nhalf- baked and rather frazzled.  The prototype may\r\nbe attractive and novel, and it does look as if it ought\r\nto be good for something-or-other.  But nobody, including\r\nthe inventor, is quite sure what.  Inventors, and speculators,\r\nand pundits may have very firm ideas about its potential\r\nuse, but those ideas are often very wrong.\r\n\r\nThe natural habitat of the Goofy Prototype is in trade shows\r\nand in the popular press.  Infant technologies need publicity\r\nand investment money like a tottering calf need milk.\r\nThis was very true of Bell's machine.  To raise research and\r\ndevelopment money, Bell toured with his device as a stage attraction.\r\n\r\nContemporary press reports of the stage debut of the telephone\r\nshowed pleased astonishment mixed with considerable dread.\r\nBell's stage telephone was a large wooden box with a crude\r\nspeaker-nozzle, the whole contraption about the size and shape\r\nof an overgrown Brownie camera.  Its buzzing steel soundplate,\r\npumped up by powerful electromagnets, was loud enough to fill\r\nan auditorium.  Bell's assistant Mr. Watson, who could manage\r\non the keyboards fairly well, kicked in by playing the organ\r\nfrom distant rooms, and, later, distant cities.  This feat was\r\nconsidered marvellous, but very eerie indeed.\r\n\r\nBell's original notion for the telephone, an idea promoted\r\nfor a couple of  years, was that it would become a mass medium.\r\nWe might recognize Bell's idea today as something close to modern\r\n\"cable radio.\"  Telephones at a central source would transmit music,\r\nSunday sermons, and important public speeches to a paying network\r\nof wired-up subscribers.\r\n\r\nAt the time, most people thought this notion made good sense.\r\nIn fact, Bell's idea  was workable.  In Hungary, this philosophy\r\nof the telephone was successfully put into everyday practice.\r\nIn Budapest, for decades, from 1893 until after World War I,\r\nthere was a government-run information  service called\r\n\"Telefon Hirmondo-.\"  Hirmondo- was a centralized source\r\nof news and entertainment and culture, including stock reports,\r\nplays, concerts, and novels read aloud.  At certain hours\r\nof the day, the phone would ring, you would plug in\r\na loudspeaker for the use of the family, and Telefon\r\nHirmondo- would be on the air--or rather, on the phone.\r\n\r\nHirmondo- is dead tech today, but Hirmondo- might be considered\r\na spiritual ancestor of the modern telephone-accessed computer\r\ndata services, such as CompuServe, GEnie or Prodigy.\r\nThe principle behind Hirmondo- is also not too far from computer\r\n\"bulletin- board systems\" or BBS's, which arrived in the late 1970s,\r\nspread rapidly across America, and will figure largely in this book.\r\n\r\nWe are used to using telephones for individual person-to-person speech,\r\nbecause we are used to the Bell system.  But this was just one possibility\r\namong many.  Communication networks are very flexible and protean,\r\nespecially when their hardware becomes sufficiently advanced.\r\nThey can be put to all kinds of uses.  And they have been--\r\nand they will be.\r\n\r\nBell's telephone was bound for glory, but this was a combination\r\nof political decisions, canny infighting in court, inspired industrial\r\nleadership, receptive local conditions and outright good luck.\r\nMuch the same is true of communications systems today.\r\n\r\nAs Bell and his backers struggled to install their newfangled system\r\nin the real world of nineteenth-century New England, they had to fight\r\nagainst skepticism and industrial rivalry.  There was already a strong\r\nelectrical communications network present in America: the telegraph.\r\nThe head of the Western Union telegraph system dismissed Bell's prototype\r\nas \"an electrical toy\" and refused to buy the rights to Bell's patent.\r\nThe telephone, it seemed, might be all right as a parlor entertainment--\r\nbut not for serious business.\r\n\r\nTelegrams, unlike mere telephones, left a permanent physical record\r\nof their messages.  Telegrams, unlike telephones, could be answered\r\nwhenever the recipient had time and convenience.  And the telegram\r\nhad a much longer distance-range than Bell's early telephone.\r\nThese factors made telegraphy seem a much more sound and businesslike\r\ntechnology--at least to some.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph system was huge, and well-entrenched.\r\nIn 1876, the United States had 214,000 miles of telegraph wire,\r\nand 8500 telegraph offices.  There were specialized telegraphs\r\nfor businesses and stock traders, government, police and fire departments.\r\nAnd Bell's \"toy\" was best known as a stage-magic musical device.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of technology is known as the \"Cash Cow\" stage.\r\nIn the \"cash cow\" stage, a technology finds its place in the world,\r\nand matures, and becomes settled and productive.  After a year or so,\r\nAlexander Graham Bell and his capitalist backers concluded that\r\neerie music piped from nineteenth-century cyberspace was not the real\r\nselling-point of his invention.  Instead, the telephone was about speech--\r\nindividual, personal speech, the human voice, human conversation and\r\nhuman interaction.  The telephone was not to be managed from any centralized\r\nbroadcast center.  It was to be a personal, intimate technology.\r\n\r\nWhen you picked up a telephone, you were not absorbing\r\nthe cold output of a machine--you were speaking to another human being.\r\nOnce people realized this, their instinctive dread of the telephone\r\nas an eerie, unnatural device, swiftly vanished.  A \"telephone call\"\r\nwas not a \"call\" from a \"telephone\" itself, but a call from another\r\nhuman being, someone you would generally know and recognize.\r\nThe real point was not what the machine could do for you (or to you),\r\nbut what you yourself, a person and citizen, could do THROUGH the machine.\r\nThis decision on the part of the young Bell Company was absolutely vital.\r\n\r\nThe first telephone networks went up around Boston--mostly among\r\nthe technically curious and the well-to-do (much the same segment\r\nof the American populace that, a hundred years later, would be\r\nbuying personal computers).  Entrenched backers of the telegraph\r\ncontinued to scoff.\r\n\r\nBut in January 1878, a disaster made the telephone famous.\r\nA train crashed in Tarriffville, Connecticut.  Forward-looking\r\ndoctors in the nearby city of Hartford had had Bell's\r\n\"speaking telephone\" installed.  An alert local druggist\r\nwas able to telephone an entire community of local doctors,\r\nwho rushed to the site to give aid.  The disaster, as disasters do,\r\naroused intense press coverage.  The phone had proven its usefulness\r\nin the real world.\r\n\r\nAfter Tarriffville, the telephone network spread like crabgrass.\r\nBy 1890 it was all over New England.  By '93, out to Chicago.\r\nBy '97, into Minnesota, Nebraska and Texas.  By 1904 it was\r\nall over the continent.\r\n\r\nThe telephone had become a mature technology.  Professor Bell\r\n(now generally known as \"Dr. Bell\" despite his lack of a formal degree)\r\nbecame quite wealthy.  He lost interest in the tedious day-to-day business\r\nmuddle of the booming telephone network, and gratefully returned\r\nhis attention to creatively hacking-around in his various laboratories,\r\nwhich were now much larger, better-ventilated, and gratifyingly\r\nbetter-equipped.  Bell was never to have another great inventive success,\r\nthough his speculations and prototypes anticipated fiber-optic transmission,\r\nmanned flight, sonar, hydrofoil ships, tetrahedral construction, and\r\nMontessori education.  The \"decibel,\" the standard scientific measure\r\nof sound intensity, was named after Bell.\r\n\r\nNot all Bell's vaporware notions were inspired.  He was fascinated\r\nby human eugenics.  He also spent many years developing a weird personal\r\nsystem of astrophysics in which gravity did not exist.\r\n\r\nBell was a definite eccentric.  He was something of a hypochondriac,\r\nand throughout his life he habitually stayed up until four A.M.,\r\nrefusing to rise before noon.  But Bell had accomplished a great feat;\r\nhe was an idol of millions and his influence, wealth, and great\r\npersonal charm, combined with his eccentricity, made him something\r\nof a loose cannon on deck.  Bell maintained a thriving scientific\r\nsalon in his winter mansion in Washington, D.C., which gave him\r\nconsiderable backstage influence in governmental and scientific circles.\r\nHe was a major financial backer of the the magazines Science and\r\nNational Geographic, both still flourishing today as important organs\r\nof the American scientific establishment.\r\n\r\nBell's companion Thomas Watson, similarly wealthy and similarly odd,\r\nbecame the ardent political disciple of a 19th-century science-fiction writer\r\nand would-be social reformer, Edward Bellamy.  Watson also trod the boards\r\nbriefly as a Shakespearian actor.\r\n\r\nThere would never be another Alexander Graham Bell,\r\nbut in years to come there would be surprising numbers\r\nof people like him.  Bell was a prototype of the\r\nhigh-tech entrepreneur.  High-tech entrepreneurs will\r\nplay a very prominent role in this book: not merely as\r\ntechnicians and businessmen, but as pioneers of the\r\ntechnical frontier, who can carry the power and prestige\r\nthey derive from high-technology into the political and\r\nsocial arena.\r\n\r\nLike later entrepreneurs, Bell was fierce in defense of\r\nhis own technological territory.  As the telephone began to\r\nflourish, Bell was soon involved in violent lawsuits in the\r\ndefense of his patents.  Bell's Boston lawyers were\r\nexcellent, however, and Bell himself, as an elocution\r\nteacher and gifted public speaker, was a devastatingly\r\neffective legal witness.  In the eighteen years of Bell's patents,\r\nthe Bell company was involved in six hundred separate lawsuits.\r\nThe legal records printed filled 149 volumes.  The Bell Company\r\nwon every single suit.\r\n\r\nAfter Bell's exclusive patents expired, rival telephone\r\ncompanies sprang up all over America.  Bell's company,\r\nAmerican Bell Telephone, was soon in deep trouble.\r\nIn 1907, American Bell Telephone fell into the hands of the\r\nrather sinister J.P. Morgan financial cartel, robber-baron\r\nspeculators who dominated Wall Street.\r\n\r\nAt this point, history might have taken a different turn.\r\nAmerican might well have been served forever by a patchwork\r\nof locally owned telephone companies.  Many state politicians\r\nand local businessmen considered this an excellent solution.\r\n\r\nBut the new Bell holding company, American Telephone and Telegraph\r\nor AT&T, put in a new man at the helm, a visionary industrialist\r\nnamed Theodore Vail.  Vail, a former Post Office manager,\r\nunderstood large organizations and had an innate feeling\r\nfor the nature of large-scale communications.  Vail quickly\r\nsaw to it that AT&T seized the technological edge once again.\r\nThe Pupin and Campbell \"loading coil,\" and the deForest\r\n\"audion,\" are both extinct technology today, but in 1913\r\nthey gave Vail's company the best LONG-DISTANCE lines\r\never built.  By controlling long-distance--the links\r\nbetween, and over, and above the smaller local phone\r\ncompanies--AT&T swiftly gained the whip-hand over them,\r\nand was soon devouring them right and left.\r\n\r\nVail plowed the profits back into research and development,\r\nstarting the Bell tradition of huge-scale and brilliant\r\nindustrial research.\r\n\r\nTechnically and financially, AT&T gradually steamrollered\r\nthe opposition.  Independent telephone companies never\r\nbecame entirely extinct, and hundreds of them flourish today.\r\nBut Vail's  AT&T became the supreme communications company.\r\nAt one point, Vail's AT&T bought Western Union itself,\r\nthe very company that had derided Bell's telephone as a \"toy.\"\r\nVail thoroughly reformed Western Union's hidebound business\r\nalong his modern principles;  but when the federal government\r\ngrew anxious at this centralization of power, Vail politely\r\ngave Western Union back.\r\n\r\nThis centralizing process was not unique.  Very similar\r\nevents had happened in American steel, oil, and railroads.\r\nBut AT&T, unlike the other companies, was to remain supreme.\r\nThe monopoly robber-barons of those other industries\r\nwere humbled and shattered by government trust-busting.\r\n\r\nVail, the former Post Office official, was quite willing\r\nto accommodate the US government; in fact he would\r\nforge an active alliance with it.  AT&T would become\r\nalmost a wing of the American government, almost\r\nanother Post Office--though not quite.  AT&T would\r\nwillingly submit to federal regulation, but in return,\r\nit would use the government's regulators as its own police,\r\nwho would keep out competitors and assure the Bell\r\nsystem's profits and preeminence.\r\n\r\nThis was the second birth--the political birth--of the\r\nAmerican telephone system.  Vail's arrangement was to\r\npersist, with vast success, for many decades, until 1982.\r\nHis system was an odd kind of American industrial socialism.\r\nIt was born at about the same time as Leninist Communism,\r\nand it lasted almost as long--and, it must be admitted,\r\nto considerably better effect.\r\n\r\nVail's system worked.  Except perhaps for aerospace,\r\nthere has been no technology more thoroughly dominated\r\nby Americans than the telephone.  The telephone was\r\nseen from the beginning as a quintessentially American\r\ntechnology.  Bell's policy, and the policy of Theodore Vail,\r\nwas a profoundly democratic policy of UNIVERSAL ACCESS.\r\nVail's famous corporate slogan, \"One Policy, One System,\r\nUniversal Service,\" was a political slogan, with a very\r\nAmerican ring to it.\r\n\r\nThe American telephone was not to become the specialized tool\r\nof government or business, but a general public utility.\r\nAt first, it was true, only the wealthy  could afford\r\nprivate telephones, and Bell's company pursued the\r\nbusiness markets primarily.  The American phone system\r\nwas a capitalist effort, meant to make money; it was not a charity.\r\nBut from the first, almost all communities with telephone service\r\nhad public telephones.  And many stores--especially drugstores--\r\noffered public use of their phones.  You might not own a telephone--\r\nbut you could always get into the system, if you really needed to.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing inevitable about this decision to make telephones\r\n\"public\" and \"universal.\"  Vail's system involved a profound act\r\nof trust in the public.  This decision was a political one,\r\ninformed by the basic values of the American republic.\r\nThe situation might have been very different;\r\nand in other countries, under other systems,\r\nit certainly was.\r\n\r\nJoseph Stalin, for instance, vetoed plans for a Soviet\r\nphone system soon after the Bolshevik revolution.\r\nStalin was certain that publicly accessible telephones\r\nwould become instruments of anti-Soviet counterrevolution\r\nand conspiracy.  (He was probably right.)  When telephones\r\ndid arrive in the Soviet Union, they would be instruments\r\nof Party authority, and always heavily tapped.  (Alexander\r\nSolzhenitsyn's prison-camp novel The First Circle\r\ndescribes efforts to develop a phone system more suited\r\nto Stalinist purposes.)\r\n\r\nFrance, with its tradition of rational centralized government,\r\nhad fought bitterly even against the electric telegraph,\r\nwhich seemed to the French entirely too anarchical and frivolous.\r\nFor decades, nineteenth-century France communicated via the\r\n\"visual telegraph,\" a nation-spanning, government-owned semaphore\r\nsystem of huge stone towers that signalled from hilltops,\r\nacross vast distances, with big windmill-like arms.\r\nIn 1846, one Dr. Barbay, a semaphore enthusiast,\r\nmemorably uttered an early version of what might be called\r\n\"the security expert's argument\" against the open media.\r\n\r\n\"No, the electric telegraph is not a sound invention.\r\nIt will always be at the mercy of the slightest disruption,\r\nwild youths, drunkards, bums, etc. . . .  The electric telegraph\r\nmeets those destructive elements with only a few meters of wire\r\nover which supervision is impossible.  A single man could,\r\nwithout being seen, cut the telegraph wires leading to Paris,\r\nand in twenty-four hours cut in ten different places the wires\r\nof the same line, without being arrested.  The visual telegraph,\r\non the contrary, has its towers, its high walls, its gates\r\nwell-guarded from inside by strong armed men.  Yes, I declare,\r\nsubstitution of the electric telegraph for the visual one\r\nis a dreadful measure, a truly idiotic act.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Barbay and his high-security stone machines\r\nwere eventually unsuccessful, but his argument--\r\nthat communication  exists for the safety and convenience\r\nof the state, and must be carefully protected from the wild\r\nboys and the gutter rabble who might want to crash the\r\nsystem--would be heard again and again.\r\n\r\nWhen the French telephone system finally did arrive,\r\nits snarled inadequacy was to be notorious.  Devotees\r\nof the American Bell System often recommended a trip\r\nto France, for skeptics.\r\n\r\nIn Edwardian Britain, issues of class and privacy\r\nwere a ball-and-chain for telephonic progress.  It was\r\nconsidered outrageous that anyone--any wild fool off\r\nthe street--could simply barge bellowing into one's office\r\nor home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell.\r\nIn Britain, phones were tolerated for the use of business,\r\nbut private phones tended be stuffed away into closets,\r\nsmoking rooms, or servants' quarters.  Telephone operators\r\nwere resented in Britain because they did not seem to\r\n\"know their place.\"  And no one of breeding would print\r\na telephone number on a business card; this seemed a crass\r\nattempt to make the acquaintance of strangers.\r\n\r\nBut phone access in America was to become a popular right;\r\nsomething like universal suffrage, only more so.\r\nAmerican women could not yet vote when the phone system\r\ncame through; yet from the beginning American women\r\ndoted on the telephone.  This \"feminization\" of the\r\nAmerican telephone was often commented on by foreigners.\r\nPhones in America were not censored or stiff or formalized;\r\nthey were social, private, intimate, and domestic.\r\nIn America, Mother's Day is by far the busiest day\r\nof the year for the phone network.\r\n\r\nThe early telephone companies, and especially AT&T,\r\nwere among the foremost employers of American women.\r\nThey employed the daughters of the American middle-class\r\nin great armies: in 1891, eight thousand women; by 1946,\r\nalmost a quarter of a million.  Women seemed to enjoy\r\ntelephone work; it was respectable, it was steady,\r\nit paid fairly well as women's work went, and--not least--\r\nit seemed a genuine contribution to the social good\r\nof the community.  Women found Vail's ideal of public\r\nservice attractive.  This was especially true in rural areas,\r\nwhere women operators, running extensive rural party-lines,\r\nenjoyed considerable social power.  The operator knew everyone\r\non the party-line, and everyone knew her.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bell himself was an ardent suffragist, the\r\ntelephone company did not employ women for the sake of\r\nadvancing female liberation.  AT&T did this for sound\r\ncommercial reasons.  The first telephone operators of\r\nthe Bell system were not women, but teenage American boys.\r\nThey were telegraphic messenger boys (a group about to\r\nbe rendered technically obsolescent), who swept up\r\naround the phone office, dunned customers for bills,\r\nand made phone connections on the switchboard,\r\nall on the cheap.\r\n\r\nWithin the very first  year of operation, 1878,\r\nBell's company learned a sharp lesson about combining\r\nteenage boys and telephone switchboards.  Putting\r\nteenage boys in charge of the phone system brought swift\r\nand consistent disaster.  Bell's chief engineer described them\r\nas \"Wild Indians.\"  The boys were openly rude to customers.\r\nThey talked back to subscribers, saucing off,\r\nuttering facetious remarks, and generally giving lip.\r\nThe rascals took Saint Patrick's Day off without permission.\r\nAnd worst of all they played clever tricks with\r\nthe switchboard plugs:  disconnecting calls, crossing lines\r\nso that customers found themselves talking to strangers,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nThis combination of power, technical mastery, and effective\r\nanonymity seemed to act like catnip on teenage boys.\r\n\r\nThis wild-kid-on-the-wires phenomenon was not confined to\r\nthe USA; from the beginning, the same was true of the British\r\nphone system.  An early British commentator kindly remarked:\r\n\"No doubt boys in their teens found the work not a little irksome,\r\nand it is also highly probable that under the early conditions\r\nof employment the adventurous and inquisitive spirits of which\r\nthe average healthy boy of that age is possessed, were not always\r\nconducive to the best attention being given to the wants\r\nof the telephone subscribers.\"\r\n\r\nSo the boys were flung off the system--or at least,\r\ndeprived of control of the switchboard.  But the\r\n\"adventurous and inquisitive spirits\" of the teenage boys\r\nwould be heard from in the world of telephony, again and again.\r\n\r\nThe fourth stage in the technological life-cycle is death:\r\n\"the Dog,\" dead tech.  The telephone has so far avoided this fate.\r\nOn the contrary, it is thriving, still spreading, still evolving,\r\nand at increasing speed.\r\n\r\nThe telephone has achieved a rare and exalted state for a\r\ntechnological artifact:  it has become a HOUSEHOLD OBJECT.\r\nThe telephone, like the clock, like pen and paper,\r\nlike kitchen utensils and running water, has become\r\na technology that is visible only by its absence.\r\nThe telephone is technologically transparent.\r\nThe global telephone system is the largest and most\r\ncomplex machine in the world, yet it is easy to use.\r\nMore remarkable yet, the telephone is almost entirely\r\nphysically safe for the user.\r\n\r\nFor the average citizen in the 1870s, the telephone\r\nwas weirder, more shocking, more \"high-tech\" and\r\nharder to comprehend, than the most outrageous stunts\r\nof advanced computing for us Americans in the 1990s.\r\nIn trying to understand what is happening to us today,\r\nwith our bulletin-board systems, direct overseas dialling,\r\nfiber-optic transmissions, computer viruses, hacking stunts,\r\nand a vivid tangle of new laws and new crimes, it is important\r\nto realize that our society has been through a similar challenge before--\r\nand that, all in all, we did rather well by it.\r\n\r\nBell's stage telephone seemed bizarre at first.  But the\r\nsensations of weirdness vanished quickly, once people began\r\nto hear the familiar voices of relatives and friends,\r\nin their own homes on their own telephones.  The telephone\r\nchanged from a fearsome high-tech totem to an everyday pillar\r\nof human community.\r\n\r\nThis has also happened, and is still happening,\r\nto computer networks.  Computer networks such as\r\nNSFnet, BITnet, USENET, JANET, are technically\r\nadvanced, intimidating, and much harder to use than\r\ntelephones.  Even the popular, commercial computer\r\nnetworks, such as GEnie, Prodigy, and CompuServe,\r\ncause much head-scratching and have been described\r\nas \"user-hateful.\"  Nevertheless they too are changing\r\nfrom fancy high-tech items into everyday sources\r\nof human community.\r\n\r\nThe words \"community\" and \"communication\" have\r\nthe same root.  Wherever you put a communications\r\nnetwork, you put a community as well.  And whenever\r\nyou TAKE AWAY that network--confiscate it, outlaw it,\r\ncrash it, raise its price beyond affordability--\r\nthen you hurt that community.\r\n\r\nCommunities  will fight to defend themselves.  People will fight harder\r\nand more bitterly to defend their communities, than they will fight\r\nto defend their own individual selves.  And this is very true\r\nof the \"electronic community\" that arose around computer networks\r\nin the 1980s--or rather, the VARIOUS electronic communities,\r\nin telephony, law enforcement, computing, and the digital\r\nunderground that, by the year 1990, were raiding, rallying,\r\narresting, suing, jailing, fining and issuing angry manifestos.\r\n\r\nNone of the events of 1990 were entirely new.\r\nNothing happened in 1990 that did not have some kind\r\nof earlier and more understandable precedent.  What gave\r\nthe Hacker Crackdown its new sense of gravity and\r\nimportance was the feeling--the COMMUNITY feeling--\r\nthat the political stakes had been raised; that trouble\r\nin cyberspace was no longer mere mischief or inconclusive\r\nskirmishing, but a genuine fight over genuine issues,\r\na fight for community survival and the shape of the future.\r\n\r\nThese electronic communities, having flourished throughout\r\nthe 1980s, were becoming aware of themselves, and increasingly,\r\nbecoming aware of other, rival communities.  Worries were\r\nsprouting up right and left, with complaints, rumors,\r\nuneasy speculations. But it would take a catalyst, a shock,\r\nto make the new world evident.  Like Bell's great publicity break,\r\nthe Tarriffville Rail Disaster of January 1878,\r\nit would take a cause celebre.\r\n\r\nThat cause was the AT&T Crash of January 15, 1990.\r\nAfter the Crash, the wounded and anxious telephone\r\ncommunity would come out fighting hard.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe community of telephone technicians, engineers, operators\r\nand researchers is the oldest community in cyberspace.\r\nThese are the veterans, the most developed group,\r\nthe richest, the most respectable, in most ways the most powerful.\r\nWhole generations have come and gone since Alexander Graham Bell's day,\r\nbut the community he founded survives; people work for the phone system\r\ntoday whose great-grandparents worked for the phone system.\r\nIts specialty magazines, such as Telephony, AT&T Technical Journal,\r\nTelephone Engineer and Management, are decades old;\r\nthey make computer publications like Macworld and PC Week\r\nlook like amateur johnny-come-latelies.\r\n\r\nAnd the phone companies take no back seat in high-technology, either.\r\nOther companies' industrial researchers may have won new markets;\r\nbut the researchers of Bell Labs have won SEVEN NOBEL PRIZES.\r\nOne potent device that Bell Labs originated, the transistor,\r\nhas created entire GROUPS of industries.  Bell Labs are\r\nworld-famous for generating \"a patent a day,\" and have even\r\nmade vital discoveries in astronomy, physics and cosmology.\r\n\r\nThroughout its seventy-year history, \"Ma Bell\" was not so much\r\na company as a way of life.  Until the cataclysmic divestiture\r\nof the 1980s, Ma Bell was perhaps the ultimate maternalist mega-employer.\r\nThe AT&T corporate image was the \"gentle giant,\"  \"the voice with a smile,\"\r\na vaguely socialist-realist world of cleanshaven linemen in shiny helmets\r\nand blandly pretty phone-girls in headsets and nylons.  Bell System\r\nemployees were famous as rock-ribbed Kiwanis and Rotary members,\r\nLittle-League enthusiasts, school-board people.\r\n\r\nDuring the long heyday of Ma Bell, the Bell employee corps\r\nwere nurtured top-to-bottom on a corporate ethos of public service.\r\nThere was good money in Bell, but Bell was not ABOUT money;\r\nBell used public relations, but never mere marketeering.\r\nPeople went into the Bell System for a good life,\r\nand they had a good life.  But it was not mere money\r\nthat led Bell people out in the midst of storms and earthquakes\r\nto fight with toppled phone-poles, to wade in flooded manholes,\r\nto pull the red-eyed graveyard-shift over collapsing switching-systems.\r\nThe Bell ethic was the electrical equivalent of the postman's:\r\nneither rain, nor snow, nor gloom of night would stop these couriers.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to be cynical about this, as it is easy to be\r\ncynical about any political or social system;  but cynicism\r\ndoes not change the fact that thousands of people took\r\nthese ideals very seriously.  And some still do.\r\n\r\nThe Bell ethos was about public service; and that was\r\ngratifying; but it was also about private POWER, and that\r\nwas gratifying too.  As a corporation, Bell was very special.\r\nBell was privileged.  Bell had snuggled up close to the state.\r\nIn fact, Bell was as close to government as you could get in\r\nAmerica and still make a whole lot of legitimate money.\r\n\r\nBut unlike other companies, Bell was above and beyond\r\nthe vulgar commercial fray.  Through its regional operating companies,\r\nBell was omnipresent, local, and intimate, all over America;\r\nbut the central ivory towers at its corporate heart were the\r\ntallest and the ivoriest around.\r\n\r\nThere were other phone companies in America, to be sure;\r\nthe so-called independents.  Rural cooperatives, mostly;\r\nsmall fry, mostly tolerated, sometimes warred upon.\r\nFor many decades, \"independent\" American phone companies\r\nlived in fear and loathing of the official Bell monopoly\r\n(or the \"Bell Octopus,\" as Ma Bell's nineteenth-century\r\nenemies described her in many angry newspaper manifestos).\r\nSome few of these independent entrepreneurs, while legally\r\nin the wrong, fought so bitterly against the Octopus\r\nthat their illegal phone networks were cast into the street\r\nby Bell agents and publicly burned.\r\n\r\nThe pure technical sweetness of the Bell System gave its operators,\r\ninventors and engineers a deeply satisfying sense of power and mastery.\r\nThey had devoted their lives to improving this vast nation-spanning machine;\r\nover years, whole human lives, they had watched it improve and grow.\r\nIt was like a great technological  temple.  They were an elite,\r\nand they knew it--even if others did not; in fact, they felt\r\neven more powerful BECAUSE others did not understand.\r\n\r\nThe deep attraction of this sensation of elite technical power\r\nshould never be underestimated.  \"Technical power\" is not for everybody;\r\nfor many people it simply has no charm at all.  But for some people,\r\nit becomes the core of their lives.  For a few, it is overwhelming,\r\nobsessive;  it becomes something close to an addiction.  People--especially\r\nclever teenage boys whose lives are otherwise mostly powerless and put-upon\r\n--love this sensation of secret power, and are willing to do all sorts\r\nof amazing things to achieve it.  The technical POWER of electronics\r\nhas motivated many  strange acts detailed in this book, which would\r\notherwise be inexplicable.\r\n\r\nSo Bell had power beyond mere capitalism.  The Bell service ethos worked,\r\nand was often propagandized, in a rather saccharine fashion.  Over the decades,\r\npeople slowly grew tired of this.  And then, openly impatient with it.\r\nBy the early 1980s, Ma Bell was to find herself with scarcely a real friend\r\nin the world.  Vail's industrial socialism had become hopelessly\r\nout-of-fashion politically.  Bell would be punished for that.\r\nAnd that punishment would fall harshly upon the people of the\r\ntelephone community.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIn 1983, Ma Bell was dismantled by federal court action.\r\nThe pieces of Bell are now separate corporate entities.\r\nThe core of the company became AT&T Communications,\r\nand also AT&T Industries (formerly Western Electric,\r\nBell's manufacturing arm).  AT&T Bell Labs became Bell\r\nCommunications Research, Bellcore.  Then there are the\r\nRegional Bell Operating Companies, or  RBOCs, pronounced \"arbocks.\"\r\n\r\nBell was a titan and even these regional chunks are gigantic enterprises:\r\nFortune 50 companies with plenty of wealth and power behind them.\r\nBut the clean lines of \"One Policy, One System, Universal Service\"\r\nhave been shattered, apparently forever.\r\n\r\nThe \"One Policy\" of the early Reagan Administration was to\r\nshatter a system that smacked of noncompetitive socialism.\r\nSince that time, there has been no real telephone \"policy\"\r\non the federal level.  Despite the breakup, the remnants\r\nof Bell have never been set free to compete in the open marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe RBOCs are still very heavily regulated, but not from the top.\r\nInstead, they struggle politically, economically and legally,\r\nin what seems an endless turmoil, in a patchwork of overlapping federal\r\nand state jurisdictions.  Increasingly, like other major American corporations,\r\nthe RBOCs are becoming multinational, acquiring important commercial interests\r\nin Europe, Latin America, and the Pacific Rim.  But this, too, adds to their\r\nlegal and political predicament.\r\n\r\nThe people of what used to be Ma Bell are not happy about their fate.\r\nThey feel ill-used.  They might have been grudgingly willing to make\r\na full transition to the free market; to become just companies amid\r\nother companies.  But this never happened.  Instead, AT&T and the RBOCS\r\n(\"the Baby Bells\")  feel themselves wrenched from side to side by state\r\nregulators, by Congress, by the FCC, and especially by the federal court\r\nof Judge Harold Greene, the magistrate who ordered the Bell breakup\r\nand who has been the de facto czar of American telecommunications\r\never since 1983.\r\n\r\nBell people feel that they exist in a kind of paralegal limbo today.\r\nThey don't understand what's demanded of them.  If it's \"service,\"\r\nwhy aren't they treated like a public service?  And if it's money,\r\nthen why aren't they free to compete for it?  No one seems to know,\r\nreally.  Those who claim to know  keep changing their minds.\r\nNobody in authority seems willing to grasp the nettle for once and all.\r\n\r\nTelephone people from other countries are amazed by the\r\nAmerican telephone system today.  Not that it works so well;\r\nfor nowadays even the French telephone system works, more or less.\r\nThey are amazed that the American telephone system STILL works\r\nAT ALL, under these strange conditions.\r\n\r\nBell's  \"One System\" of long-distance service is now only about\r\neighty percent of a system, with the remainder held by Sprint, MCI,\r\nand the midget long-distance companies.  Ugly wars over dubious\r\ncorporate practices such as \"slamming\" (an underhanded method\r\nof snitching clients from rivals) break out with some regularity\r\nin the realm of long-distance service.  The battle to break Bell's\r\nlong-distance monopoly was long and ugly, and since the breakup\r\nthe battlefield has not become much prettier.  AT&T's famous\r\nshame-and-blame advertisements, which emphasized the shoddy work\r\nand purported ethical shadiness of their competitors, were much\r\nremarked on for their studied psychological cruelty.\r\n\r\nThere is much bad blood in this industry, and much\r\nlong-treasured resentment.  AT&T's post-breakup\r\ncorporate logo, a striped sphere, is known in the\r\nindustry as the \"Death Star\"  (a reference from the movie\r\nStar Wars, in which the \"Death Star\" was the spherical\r\nhigh- tech fortress of the harsh-breathing  imperial ultra-baddie,\r\nDarth Vader.)  Even AT&T employees are less than thrilled\r\nby the Death Star.  A popular (though banned) T-shirt among\r\nAT&T employees bears the old-fashioned Bell logo of the Bell System,\r\nplus the newfangled striped sphere, with the before-and-after comments:\r\n\"This is your brain--This is your brain on drugs!\"  AT&T made a very\r\nwell-financed and determined effort to break into the personal\r\ncomputer market;  it was disastrous, and telco computer experts\r\nare derisively known by their competitors as \"the pole-climbers.\"\r\nAT&T and the Baby Bell arbocks still seem to have few friends.\r\n\r\nUnder conditions of sharp commercial competition, a crash like\r\nthat of January 15, 1990 was a major embarrassment to AT&T.\r\nIt was a direct blow against their much-treasured reputation\r\nfor reliability.  Within days of the crash AT&T's\r\nChief Executive Officer, Bob Allen, officially apologized,\r\nin terms of deeply pained  humility:\r\n\r\n\"AT&T had a major service disruption last Monday.\r\nWe didn't live up to our own standards of quality,\r\nand we didn't live up to yours. It's as simple as that.\r\nAnd that's not acceptable to us.  Or to you. . . .\r\nWe understand how much people have come to depend\r\nupon AT&T service, so our AT&T Bell Laboratories scientists\r\nand our network engineers are doing everything possible\r\nto guard against a recurrence. . . .  We know there's no way\r\nto make up for the inconvenience this problem may have caused you.\"\r\n\r\nMr Allen's \"open letter to customers\" was printed in lavish ads\r\nall over the country:  in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today,\r\nNew York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune,\r\nPhiladelphia Inquirer, San Francisco Chronicle Examiner,\r\nBoston Globe, Dallas Morning News, Detroit Free Press,\r\nWashington Post, Houston Chronicle, Cleveland Plain Dealer,\r\nAtlanta Journal Constitution, Minneapolis Star Tribune,\r\nSt. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer,\r\nTacoma News Tribune, Miami Herald, Pittsburgh Press,\r\nSt. Louis Post Dispatch, Denver Post, Phoenix Republic Gazette\r\nand Tampa Tribune.\r\n\r\nIn another press release, AT&T went to some pains to suggest\r\nthat this \"software glitch\" might have happened just as easily to MCI,\r\nalthough, in fact, it hadn't.  (MCI's switching software was quite different\r\nfrom AT&T's--though not necessarily any safer.)  AT&T also announced\r\ntheir plans to offer a rebate of service on Valentine's Day to make up\r\nfor the loss during the Crash.\r\n\r\n\"Every technical resource available, including Bell Labs\r\nscientists and engineers, has been devoted to assuring\r\nit will not occur again,\" the public was told.  They were\r\nfurther assured that \"The chances of a recurrence are small--\r\na problem of this magnitude never occurred before.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, police and corporate\r\nsecurity maintained their own suspicions about\r\n\"the chances of recurrence\" and the real reason why\r\na \"problem of this magnitude\" had appeared, seemingly\r\nout of nowhere.  Police and security knew for a fact\r\nthat hackers of unprecedented sophistication were illegally\r\nentering, and reprogramming, certain digital switching stations.\r\nRumors of hidden \"viruses\" and secret \"logic bombs\"\r\nin the switches ran rampant in the underground,\r\nwith much chortling over AT&T's predicament,\r\nand idle speculation over what unsung hacker genius\r\nwas responsible for it.  Some hackers, including police\r\ninformants, were trying hard to finger one another\r\nas the true culprits  of the Crash.\r\n\r\nTelco people found little comfort in objectivity when\r\nthey contemplated these possibilities.  It was just too close\r\nto the bone for them; it was embarrassing; it hurt so much,\r\nit was hard even to talk about.\r\n\r\nThere has always been thieving and misbehavior in the phone system.\r\nThere has always been trouble with the rival independents,\r\nand in the local loops.  But to have such trouble in the core\r\nof the system, the long-distance switching stations,\r\nis a horrifying affair.  To telco people, this is\r\nall the difference between finding roaches in your kitchen\r\nand big horrid sewer-rats in your bedroom.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside, to the average citizen, the telcos\r\nstill seem gigantic and impersonal.  The American public\r\nseems to regard them as something akin to Soviet apparats.\r\nEven when the telcos  do their best corporate-citizen routine,\r\nsubsidizing magnet high-schools and sponsoring news-shows\r\non public television, they seem to win little except public suspicion.\r\n\r\nBut from the inside, all this looks very different.\r\nThere's harsh competition.  A legal and political system\r\nthat seems baffled and bored, when not actively hostile\r\nto telco interests.  There's a loss of morale, a deep sensation\r\nof having somehow lost the upper hand.  Technological change\r\nhas caused a loss of data and revenue to other, newer forms\r\nof transmission.  There's theft, and new forms of theft,\r\nof growing scale and boldness and sophistication.\r\nWith all these factors, it was no surprise to see the telcos,\r\nlarge and small, break out in a litany of bitter complaint.\r\n\r\nIn late '88 and throughout 1989, telco representatives\r\ngrew shrill in their complaints to those few American law\r\nenforcement officials who make it their business to try to\r\nunderstand what telephone people are talking about.\r\nTelco security officials had discovered the computer-\r\nhacker underground, infiltrated it thoroughly,\r\nand become deeply alarmed at its growing expertise.\r\nHere they had found a target that was not only loathsome\r\non its face, but clearly ripe for counterattack.\r\n\r\nThose bitter rivals: AT&T, MCI and Sprint--and a crowd\r\nof Baby Bells:  PacBell, Bell South, Southwestern Bell,\r\nNYNEX, USWest, as well as the Bell research consortium Bellcore,\r\nand the independent long-distance carrier Mid-American--\r\nall were to have their role in the great hacker dragnet of 1990.\r\nAfter years of being battered and pushed around, the telcos had,\r\nat least in a small way, seized the initiative again.\r\nAfter years of turmoil, telcos and government officials were\r\nonce again to work smoothly in concert in defense of the System.\r\nOptimism blossomed; enthusiasm grew on all sides;\r\nthe prospective taste of vengeance was sweet.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning--even before the crackdown had a name--\r\nsecrecy was a big problem.  There were many good reasons\r\nfor secrecy in the hacker crackdown.  Hackers and code-thieves\r\nwere wily prey, slinking back to their bedrooms and basements\r\nand destroying vital incriminating evidence at the first hint of trouble.\r\nFurthermore, the crimes themselves were heavily technical and difficult\r\nto describe, even to police--much less to the general public.\r\n\r\nWhen such crimes HAD been described intelligibly to the public,\r\nin the past, that very publicity had tended to INCREASE the crimes\r\nenormously.  Telco officials, while painfully aware of the vulnerabilities\r\nof their systems, were anxious not to publicize those weaknesses.\r\nExperience showed them that those weaknesses, once discovered,\r\nwould be pitilessly exploited by tens of thousands of people--not only\r\nby professional grifters and by underground hackers and phone phreaks,\r\nbut by many otherwise more-or-less honest everyday folks, who regarded\r\nstealing service from the faceless, soulless \"Phone Company\" as a kind of\r\nharmless indoor sport.  When it came to protecting their interests,\r\ntelcos had long since given up on general public sympathy for\r\n\"the Voice with a Smile.\"  Nowadays the telco's \"Voice\" was\r\nvery likely to be a computer's; and the American public\r\nshowed much less of the proper respect and gratitude due\r\nthe fine public service bequeathed them by Dr. Bell and Mr. Vail.\r\nThe more efficient, high-tech, computerized, and impersonal\r\nthe telcos became, it seemed, the more they were met by\r\nsullen public resentment and amoral greed.\r\n\r\nTelco officials wanted to punish the phone-phreak underground, in as\r\npublic and exemplary a manner as possible.  They wanted to make dire\r\nexamples of the worst offenders, to seize the ringleaders and intimidate\r\nthe small fry, to discourage and frighten the wacky hobbyists, and send\r\nthe professional grifters to jail.  To do all this, publicity was vital.\r\n\r\nYet operational secrecy was even more so.  If word got out that\r\na nationwide crackdown was coming, the hackers might simply vanish;\r\ndestroy the evidence, hide their computers, go to earth,\r\nand wait for the campaign to blow over.  Even the young\r\nhackers were crafty and suspicious, and as for the professional grifters,\r\nthey tended to split for the nearest state-line at the first sign of trouble.\r\nFor the crackdown to work well, they would all have to be caught red-handed,\r\nswept upon suddenly, out of the blue, from every corner of the compass.\r\n\r\nAnd there was another strong motive for secrecy.  In the worst-case scenario,\r\na blown campaign might leave the telcos open to a devastating hacker\r\ncounter-attack.  If there were indeed hackers loose in America who\r\nhad caused the January 15 Crash--if there were truly gifted hackers,\r\nloose in the nation's long-distance switching systems, and enraged\r\nor frightened by the crackdown--then they might react unpredictably\r\nto an attempt to collar them.  Even if caught, they might have talented\r\nand vengeful friends still running around loose.  Conceivably,\r\nit could turn ugly.  Very ugly.  In fact, it was hard to imagine\r\njust how ugly things might turn, given that possibility.\r\n\r\nCounter-attack from hackers was a genuine concern for the telcos.\r\nIn point of fact, they would never suffer any such counter-attack.\r\nBut in months to come, they would be at some pains to publicize\r\nthis notion and to utter grim warnings about it.\r\n\r\nStill, that risk seemed well worth running.  Better to run the risk\r\nof vengeful attacks, than to live at the mercy of potential crashers.\r\nAny cop would tell you that a protection racket had no real future.\r\n\r\nAnd publicity was such a useful thing.  Corporate security officers,\r\nincluding telco security, generally work under conditions of great discretion.\r\nAnd corporate security officials do not make money for their companies.\r\nTheir job is to PREVENT THE LOSS of money, which is much less glamorous\r\nthan actually winning profits.\r\n\r\nIf you are a corporate security official, and you do your job brilliantly,\r\nthen nothing bad happens to your company at all.  Because of this, you appear\r\ncompletely superfluous.  This is one of the many unattractive aspects\r\nof security work.  It's rare that these folks have the chance to draw\r\nsome healthy attention to their own efforts.\r\n\r\nPublicity also served the interest of their friends in law enforcement.\r\nPublic officials, including law enforcement officials, thrive by attracting\r\nfavorable public interest.  A brilliant prosecution in a matter of vital\r\npublic interest can make the career of a prosecuting attorney.\r\nAnd for a police officer, good publicity opens the purses of the legislature;\r\nit may bring a citation, or a promotion, or at least a rise in status\r\nand the respect of one's peers.\r\n\r\nBut to have both publicity and secrecy is to have one's cake and eat it too.\r\nIn months to come, as we will show, this impossible act was to cause great\r\npain to the agents of the crackdown.  But early on, it seemed possible\r\n--maybe even likely--that the crackdown could successfully combine\r\nthe best of both worlds.  The ARREST of hackers would be heavily publicized.\r\nThe actual DEEDS of the hackers, which were technically hard to explain\r\nand also a security risk, would be left decently obscured.  The THREAT\r\nhackers posed would be heavily trumpeted; the likelihood of their actually\r\ncommitting such fearsome crimes would be left to the public's imagination.\r\nThe spread of the computer underground, and its growing technical\r\nsophistication, would be heavily promoted;  the actual hackers themselves,\r\nmostly bespectacled middle-class white suburban teenagers,\r\nwould be denied any personal publicity.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to have occurred to any telco official\r\nthat the hackers accused would demand a day in court;\r\nthat journalists would smile upon the hackers as\r\n\"good copy;\"  that wealthy high-tech entrepreneurs would\r\noffer moral and financial support to crackdown victims;\r\nthat constitutional lawyers would show up with briefcases,\r\nfrowning mightily.  This possibility does not seem to have\r\never entered the game-plan.\r\n\r\nAnd even if it had, it probably would not have slowed\r\nthe ferocious pursuit of a stolen phone-company document,\r\nmellifluously known as \"Control Office Administration of\r\nEnhanced 911 Services for Special Services and Major Account Centers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the chapters to follow, we will explore the worlds\r\nof police and the computer underground, and the large\r\nshadowy area where they overlap.  But first, we must\r\nexplore the battleground.  Before we leave the world\r\nof the telcos, we must understand what a switching system\r\nactually is and how your telephone actually works.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nTo the average citizen, the idea of the telephone is represented by,\r\nwell, a TELEPHONE:  a device that you talk into.  To a telco\r\nprofessional, however, the telephone itself is known, in lordly\r\nfashion, as a \"subset.\"  The \"subset\" in your house is a mere adjunct,\r\na distant nerve ending, of the central switching stations,\r\nwhich are ranked in levels of heirarchy, up to the long-distance electronic\r\nswitching stations, which are some of the largest computers on earth.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine that it is, say, 1925, before the\r\nintroduction of computers, when the phone system was\r\nsimpler and somewhat easier to grasp.  Let's further\r\nimagine that you are Miss Leticia Luthor, a fictional\r\noperator for Ma Bell in New York City of the 20s.\r\n\r\nBasically, you, Miss Luthor, ARE the \"switching system.\"\r\nYou are sitting in front of a large vertical switchboard,\r\nknown as a \"cordboard,\" made of shiny wooden panels,\r\nwith ten thousand metal-rimmed holes punched in them,\r\nknown as jacks.  The engineers would have put more\r\nholes into your switchboard, but ten thousand is\r\nas many as you can reach without actually having\r\nto get up out of your chair.\r\n\r\nEach of these ten thousand holes has its own little electric lightbulb,\r\nknown as a \"lamp,\" and its own neatly printed number code.\r\n\r\nWith the ease of long habit, you are scanning your board for lit-up bulbs.\r\nThis is what you do most of the time, so you are used to it.\r\n\r\nA lamp lights up.  This means that the phone\r\nat the end of that line has been taken off the hook.\r\nWhenever a handset is taken off the hook, that closes a circuit\r\ninside the phone which then signals the local office, i.e. you,\r\nautomatically.  There might be somebody calling, or then\r\nagain the phone might be simply off the hook, but this\r\ndoes not matter to you yet.  The first thing you do,\r\nis record that number in your logbook, in your fine American\r\npublic-school handwriting.  This comes first, naturally,\r\nsince it is done for billing purposes.\r\n\r\nYou now take the plug of your answering cord, which goes\r\ndirectly to your headset, and plug it into the lit-up hole.\r\n\"Operator,\" you announce.\r\n\r\nIn operator's classes, before taking this job, you have\r\nbeen issued a large pamphlet full of canned operator's\r\nresponses for all kinds of contingencies, which you had\r\nto memorize.  You have also been trained in a proper\r\nnon-regional, non-ethnic pronunciation and tone of voice.\r\nYou rarely have the occasion to make any spontaneous\r\nremark to a customer, and in fact this is frowned upon\r\n(except out on the rural lines where people have time\r\non their hands and get up to all kinds of mischief).\r\n\r\nA tough-sounding user's voice at the end of the line\r\ngives you a number.  Immediately, you write that number\r\ndown in your logbook, next to the caller's number,\r\nwhich you just wrote earlier.  You then look and see if\r\nthe number this guy wants is in fact on your switchboard,\r\nwhich it generally is, since it's generally a local call.\r\nLong distance costs so much that people use it sparingly.\r\n\r\nOnly then do you pick up a calling-cord from a shelf\r\nat the base of the switchboard.  This is a long elastic cord\r\nmounted on a kind of reel so that it will zip back in when\r\nyou unplug it.  There are a lot of cords down there,\r\nand when a bunch of them are out at once they look like\r\na nest of snakes.  Some of the girls think there are bugs\r\nliving in those cable-holes.  They're called \"cable mites\"\r\nand are supposed to bite your hands and give you rashes.\r\nYou don't believe this, yourself.\r\n\r\nGripping the head of your calling-cord, you slip the tip\r\nof it deftly into the sleeve of the jack for the called person.\r\nNot all the way in, though.  You just touch it.  If you hear\r\na clicking sound, that means the line is busy and you can't\r\nput the call through.  If the line is busy, you have to stick\r\nthe calling-cord into a \"busy-tone jack,\" which will give\r\nthe guy a busy-tone.  This way you don't have to talk to him\r\nyourself and absorb his natural human frustration.\r\n\r\nBut the line isn't busy.  So you pop the cord all the way in.\r\nRelay circuits in your board make the distant phone ring,\r\nand if somebody picks it up off the hook, then a phone\r\nconversation starts.  You can hear this conversation\r\non your answering cord, until you unplug it.  In fact\r\nyou could listen to the whole conversation if you wanted,\r\nbut this is sternly frowned upon by management, and frankly,\r\nwhen you've overheard one, you've pretty much heard 'em all.\r\n\r\nYou can tell how long the conversation lasts by the glow\r\nof the calling-cord's lamp, down on the calling-cord's shelf.\r\nWhen it's over, you unplug and the calling-cord zips back into place.\r\n\r\nHaving done this stuff a few hundred thousand times,\r\nyou become quite good at it.  In fact you're plugging,\r\nand connecting, and disconnecting, ten, twenty, forty cords\r\nat a time.  It's a manual handicraft, really, quite satisfying\r\nin a way, rather like weaving on an upright loom.\r\n\r\nShould a long-distance call come up, it would be different,\r\nbut not all that different.  Instead of connecting the call\r\nthrough your own local switchboard, you have to go up the hierarchy,\r\nonto the long-distance lines, known as \"trunklines.\"\r\nDepending on how far the call goes, it may have to work\r\nits way through a whole series of operators, which can\r\ntake quite a while.  The caller doesn't wait on the line\r\nwhile this complex process is negotiated across the country\r\nby the gaggle of operators.  Instead, the caller hangs up,\r\nand you call him back yourself when the call has finally\r\nworked its way through.\r\n\r\nAfter four or five years of this work, you get married,\r\nand you have to quit your job, this being the natural order\r\nof womanhood in the American 1920s.  The phone company\r\nhas to train somebody else--maybe two people, since\r\nthe phone system has grown somewhat in the meantime.\r\nAnd this costs money.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to use any kind of human being as a switching\r\nsystem is a very expensive proposition.  Eight thousand\r\nLeticia Luthors would be bad enough, but a quarter of a\r\nmillion of them is a military-scale proposition and makes\r\ndrastic measures in automation financially worthwhile.\r\n\r\nAlthough the phone system continues to grow today,\r\nthe number of human beings employed by telcos has\r\nbeen dropping steadily for years.  Phone \"operators\"\r\nnow deal with nothing but unusual contingencies,\r\nall routine operations having been shrugged off onto machines.\r\nConsequently, telephone operators are considerably less\r\nmachine-like nowadays, and have been known to have accents\r\nand actual character in their voices.  When you reach\r\na human operator today, the operators are rather more\r\n\"human\" than they were in Leticia's day--but on the other hand,\r\nhuman beings in the phone system are much harder to reach\r\nin the first place.\r\n\r\nOver the first half of the twentieth century,\r\n\"electromechanical\" switching systems of growing\r\ncomplexity were cautiously introduced into the phone system.\r\nIn certain backwaters, some of these hybrid systems are still\r\nin use.  But after 1965, the phone system began to go completely\r\nelectronic, and this is by far the dominant mode today.\r\nElectromechanical systems have \"crossbars,\" and \"brushes,\"\r\nand other large moving mechanical parts, which, while faster\r\nand cheaper than Leticia, are still slow, and tend to wear out\r\nfairly quickly.\r\n\r\nBut fully electronic systems are inscribed on silicon chips,\r\nand are lightning-fast, very cheap, and quite durable.\r\nThey are much cheaper to maintain than even the best\r\nelectromechanical systems, and they fit into half the space.\r\nAnd with every year, the silicon chip grows smaller, faster,\r\nand cheaper yet.  Best of all, automated electronics work\r\naround the clock and don't have salaries or health insurance.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, quite serious drawbacks to the\r\nuse of computer-chips.  When they do break down, it is\r\na daunting challenge to figure out what the heck has gone\r\nwrong with them.  A broken cordboard generally had\r\na problem in it big enough to see.  A broken chip has\r\ninvisible, microscopic faults.  And the faults in bad\r\nsoftware can be so subtle as to be practically theological.\r\n\r\nIf you want a mechanical system to do something new,\r\nthen you must travel to where it is, and pull pieces out of it,\r\nand wire in new pieces.  This costs money.  However, if you want\r\na chip to do something new, all you have to do is change its software,\r\nwhich is easy, fast and dirt-cheap.  You don't even have to see the chip\r\nto change its program.  Even if you did see the chip, it wouldn't look\r\nlike much.  A chip with program X doesn't look one whit different from\r\na chip with program Y.\r\n\r\nWith the proper codes and sequences, and access to specialized phone-lines,\r\nyou can change electronic switching systems all over America from anywhere\r\nyou please.\r\n\r\nAnd so can other people.  If they know how, and if they want to,\r\nthey can sneak into a microchip via the special phonelines and diddle with it,\r\nleaving no physical trace at all.  If they broke into the operator's station\r\nand held Leticia at gunpoint, that would be very obvious.  If they broke into\r\na telco building and went after an electromechanical switch with a toolbelt,\r\nthat would at least leave many traces.  But people can do all manner of amazing\r\nthings to computer switches just by typing on a keyboard, and keyboards are\r\neverywhere today.  The extent of this vulnerability is deep, dark, broad,\r\nalmost mind-boggling, and yet this is a basic, primal fact of life about\r\nany computer on a network.\r\n\r\nSecurity experts over the past twenty years have insisted,\r\nwith growing urgency, that this basic vulnerability of computers\r\nrepresents an entirely new level of risk, of unknown but obviously\r\ndire potential to society.  And they are right.\r\n\r\nAn electronic switching station does pretty much\r\neverything Letitia did, except in nanoseconds and\r\non a much larger scale.  Compared to Miss Luthor's\r\nten thousand jacks, even a primitive 1ESS switching computer,\r\n60s vintage, has a 128,000 lines.  And the current AT&T\r\nsystem of choice is the monstrous fifth-generation 5ESS.\r\n\r\nAn Electronic Switching Station can scan every line on its \"board\"\r\nin a tenth of a second, and it does this over and over, tirelessly,\r\naround the clock.  Instead of eyes, it uses \"ferrod scanners\"\r\nto check the condition of local lines and trunks.  Instead of hands,\r\nit has \"signal distributors,\" \"central pulse distributors,\"\r\n\"magnetic latching relays,\" and \"reed switches,\" which complete\r\nand break the calls.  Instead of a brain, it has a \"central processor.\"\r\nInstead of an instruction manual, it has a program.  Instead of\r\na handwritten logbook for recording and billing calls,\r\nit has magnetic tapes. And it never has to talk to anybody.\r\nEverything a customer might say to it is done by punching\r\nthe direct-dial tone buttons on your subset.\r\n\r\nAlthough an Electronic Switching Station can't talk,\r\nit does need an interface, some way to relate to its, er,\r\nemployers.  This interface is known as the \"master control\r\ncenter.\"  (This interface might be better known simply as\r\n\"the interface,\" since it doesn't actually \"control\" phone\r\ncalls directly.  However, a term like \"Master Control\r\nCenter\" is just the kind of rhetoric that telco maintenance\r\nengineers--and hackers--find particularly satisfying.)\r\n\r\nUsing the master control center, a phone engineer can test\r\nlocal and trunk lines for malfunctions.  He (rarely she)\r\ncan check various alarm displays, measure traffic on the lines,\r\nexamine the records of telephone usage and the charges for those calls,\r\nand change the programming.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, anybody else who gets into the master control center\r\nby remote control can also do these things, if he (rarely she)\r\nhas managed to figure them out, or, more likely, has somehow swiped\r\nthe knowledge from people who already know.\r\n\r\nIn 1989 and 1990, one particular RBOC, BellSouth,\r\nwhich felt particularly troubled, spent a purported $1.2\r\nmillion on computer security.  Some think it spent as\r\nmuch as two million, if you count all the associated costs.\r\nTwo million dollars is still very little compared to the\r\ngreat cost-saving utility of telephonic computer systems.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, computers are also stupid.\r\nUnlike human beings, computers possess the truly\r\nprofound stupidity of the inanimate.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s, in the first shocks of spreading computerization,\r\nthere was much easy talk about the stupidity of computers--\r\nhow they could \"only follow the program\" and were rigidly required\r\nto do \"only what they were told.\"  There has been rather less talk\r\nabout the stupidity of computers since they began to achieve\r\ngrandmaster status in chess tournaments, and to manifest\r\nmany other impressive forms of apparent cleverness.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, computers STILL are profoundly brittle and stupid;\r\nthey are simply vastly more subtle in their stupidity and brittleness.\r\nThe computers of the 1990s are much more reliable in their components\r\nthan earlier computer systems, but they are also called upon to do\r\nfar more complex things, under far more challenging conditions.\r\n\r\nOn a basic mathematical level, every single line of\r\na software program offers a chance for some possible screwup.\r\nSoftware does not sit still when it works; it \"runs,\"\r\nit interacts with itself and with its own inputs and outputs.\r\nBy analogy, it stretches like putty into millions of possible\r\nshapes and conditions, so many shapes that they can never\r\nall be successfully tested, not even in the lifespan of the universe.\r\nSometimes the putty snaps.\r\n\r\nThe stuff we call \"software\" is not like anything that human society\r\nis used to thinking about.  Software is something like a machine,\r\nand something like mathematics, and something like language, and\r\nsomething like thought, and art, and information. . . .  But software\r\nis not in fact any of those other things.  The protean quality\r\nof software is one of the great sources of its fascination.\r\nIt also makes software very powerful, very subtle,\r\nvery unpredictable, and very risky.\r\n\r\nSome software is bad and buggy.  Some is \"robust,\"\r\neven \"bulletproof.\"  The best software is that which has\r\nbeen tested by thousands of users under thousands of\r\ndifferent conditions, over years.  It is then known as\r\n\"stable.\"  This does NOT mean that the software is\r\nnow flawless, free of bugs.  It generally means that there\r\nare plenty of bugs in it, but the bugs are well-identified\r\nand fairly well understood.\r\n\r\nThere is simply no way to assure that software is free\r\nof flaws.  Though software is mathematical in nature,\r\nit cannot by \"proven\" like a mathematical theorem;\r\nsoftware is more like language, with inherent ambiguities,\r\nwith different definitions, different assumptions,\r\ndifferent levels of meaning that can conflict.\r\n\r\nHuman beings can manage, more or less, with\r\nhuman language because we can catch the gist of it.\r\n\r\nComputers, despite years of effort in \"artificial intelligence,\"\r\nhave proven spectacularly bad in \"catching the gist\" of anything at all.\r\nThe tiniest bit of semantic grit may still bring the mightiest computer\r\ntumbling down.  One of the most hazardous things you can do to a\r\ncomputer program is try to improve it--to try to make it safer.\r\nSoftware \"patches\" represent new, untried un-\"stable\" software,\r\nwhich is by definition riskier.\r\n\r\nThe modern telephone system has come to depend,\r\nutterly and irretrievably, upon software.  And the\r\nSystem Crash of January 15, 1990, was caused by an\r\nIMPROVEMENT in software.  Or rather, an ATTEMPTED\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the problem itself--the problem per se--took this form.\r\nA piece of telco software had been written in C language, a standard\r\nlanguage of the telco field.  Within the C software was a\r\nlong \"do. . .while\" construct.  The \"do. . .while\" construct\r\ncontained a \"switch\" statement.  The \"switch\" statement contained\r\nan \"if\" clause.  The \"if\" clause contained a \"break.\"  The \"break\"\r\nwas SUPPOSED to \"break\" the \"if clause.\"  Instead, the \"break\"\r\nbroke the \"switch\" statement.\r\n\r\nThat was the problem, the actual reason why people picking up phones\r\non January 15, 1990, could not talk to one another.\r\n\r\nOr at least, that was the subtle, abstract, cyberspatial\r\nseed of the problem.  This is how the problem manifested itself\r\nfrom the realm of programming into the realm of real life.\r\n\r\nThe System 7 software for AT&T's 4ESS switching station,\r\nthe \"Generic 44E14 Central Office Switch Software,\"\r\nhad been extensively tested, and was considered very stable.\r\nBy the end of 1989, eighty of AT&T's switching systems\r\nnationwide had been programmed with the new software.  Cautiously,\r\nthirty-four stations were left to run the slower, less-capable\r\nSystem 6, because AT&T suspected there might be shakedown problems\r\nwith the new and unprecedently sophisticated System 7 network.\r\n\r\nThe stations with System 7 were programmed to switch over to a backup net\r\nin case of any problems.  In mid-December 1989, however, a new high-velocity,\r\nhigh-security software patch was distributed to each of the 4ESS switches\r\nthat would enable them to switch over even more quickly, making the System 7\r\nnetwork that much more secure.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, every one of these 4ESS switches was now in possession\r\nof a small but deadly flaw.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain the network, switches must monitor\r\nthe condition of other switches--whether they are up and running,\r\nwhether they have temporarily shut down, whether they are overloaded\r\nand in need of assistance, and so forth.  The new software helped\r\ncontrol this bookkeeping function by monitoring the status calls\r\nfrom other switches.\r\n\r\nIt only takes four to six seconds for a troubled 4ESS switch\r\nto rid itself of all its calls, drop everything temporarily,\r\nand re-boot its software from scratch.  Starting over from scratch\r\nwill generally rid the switch of any software problems that may have\r\ndeveloped in the course of running the system.  Bugs that arise will\r\nbe simply wiped out by this process.  It is a clever idea.  This process\r\nof automatically re-booting from scratch is known as the \"normal fault\r\nrecovery routine.\"  Since AT&T's software is in fact exceptionally stable,\r\nsystems rarely have to go into \"fault recovery\" in the first place;\r\nbut AT&T has always boasted of its \"real world\" reliability, and this\r\ntactic is a belt-and-suspenders routine.\r\n\r\nThe 4ESS switch used its new software to monitor its fellow switches\r\nas they recovered from faults.  As other switches came back on line\r\nafter recovery, they would send their \"OK\" signals to the switch.\r\nThe switch would make a little note to that effect in its \"status map,\"\r\nrecognizing that the fellow switch was back and ready to go,\r\nand should be sent some calls and put back to regular work.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while it was busy bookkeeping with the status map,\r\nthe tiny flaw in the brand-new software came into play.\r\nThe flaw caused the 4ESS switch to interact, subtly but drastically,\r\nwith incoming telephone calls from human users.  If--and only if--\r\ntwo incoming phone-calls happened to hit the switch within a hundredth\r\nof a second, then a small patch of data would be garbled by the flaw.\r\n\r\nBut the switch had been programmed to monitor itself\r\nconstantly for any possible damage to its data.\r\nWhen the switch perceived that its data had been somehow garbled,\r\nthen it too would go down, for swift repairs to its software.\r\nIt would signal its fellow switches not to send any more work.\r\nIt would go into the fault-recovery mode for four to six seconds.\r\nAnd then the switch would be fine again, and would send out its \"OK,\r\nready for work\" signal.\r\n\r\nHowever, the \"OK, ready for work\" signal was the VERY THING THAT\r\nHAD CAUSED THE SWITCH TO GO DOWN IN THE FIRST PLACE.  And ALL the\r\nSystem 7 switches had the same flaw in their status-map software.\r\nAs soon as they stopped to make the bookkeeping note that their fellow\r\nswitch was \"OK,\" then they too would become vulnerable to the slight\r\nchance that two phone-calls would hit them within a hundredth of a second.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 2:25 P.M. EST on Monday, January 15,\r\none of AT&T's 4ESS toll switching systems in New York City\r\nhad an actual, legitimate, minor problem.  It went into fault\r\nrecovery routines, announced \"I'm going down,\" then announced,\r\n\"I'm back, I'm OK.\"  And this cheery message then blasted\r\nthroughout the network to many of its fellow 4ESS switches.\r\n\r\nMany of the switches, at first, completely escaped trouble.\r\nThese lucky switches were not hit by the coincidence of\r\ntwo phone calls within a hundredth of a second.\r\nTheir software did not fail--at first.  But three switches--\r\nin Atlanta, St. Louis, and Detroit--were unlucky,\r\nand were caught with their hands full.  And they went down.\r\nAnd they came back up, almost immediately.  And they too began\r\nto broadcast the lethal message that they, too, were \"OK\" again,\r\nactivating the lurking software bug in yet other switches.\r\n\r\nAs more and more switches did have that bit of bad luck\r\nand collapsed, the call-traffic became more and more densely\r\npacked in the remaining switches, which were groaning\r\nto keep up with the load.  And of course, as the calls\r\nbecame more densely packed, the switches were MUCH MORE LIKELY\r\nto be hit twice within a hundredth of a second.\r\n\r\nIt only took four seconds for a switch to get well.\r\nThere was no PHYSICAL damage of any kind to the switches,\r\nafter all.  Physically, they were working perfectly.\r\nThis situation was \"only\" a software problem.\r\n\r\nBut the 4ESS switches were leaping up and down every\r\nfour to six seconds, in a virulent spreading wave all over America,\r\nin utter, manic, mechanical stupidity.  They kept KNOCKING\r\none another down with their contagious \"OK\" messages.\r\n\r\nIt took about ten minutes for the chain reaction to cripple the network.\r\nEven then, switches would periodically luck-out and manage to resume\r\ntheir normal work.  Many calls--millions of them--were managing\r\nto get through.  But millions weren't.\r\n\r\nThe switching stations that used System 6 were not directly affected.\r\nThanks to these old-fashioned switches, AT&T's national system avoided\r\ncomplete collapse.  This fact also made it clear to engineers that\r\nSystem 7 was at fault.\r\n\r\nBell Labs engineers, working feverishly in New Jersey, Illinois,\r\nand Ohio, first tried their entire repertoire of standard network\r\nremedies on the malfunctioning System 7.  None of the remedies worked,\r\nof course, because nothing like this had ever happened to any\r\nphone system before.\r\n\r\nBy cutting out the backup safety network entirely,\r\nthey were able to reduce the frenzy of \"OK\" messages\r\nby about half.  The system then began to recover, as the\r\nchain reaction slowed.  By 11:30 P.M. on Monday January\r\n15, sweating engineers on the midnight shift breathed a\r\nsigh of relief as the last switch cleared-up.\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday they were pulling all the brand-new 4ESS software\r\nand replacing it with an earlier version of System 7.\r\n\r\nIf these had been human operators, rather than\r\ncomputers at work, someone would simply have\r\neventually stopped screaming.  It would have been\r\nOBVIOUS that the situation was not \"OK,\" and common\r\nsense would have kicked in.  Humans possess common sense--\r\nat least to some extent.  Computers simply don't.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, computers can handle hundreds\r\nof calls per second.  Humans simply can't.  If every single\r\nhuman being in America worked for the phone company,\r\nwe couldn't match the performance of digital switches:\r\ndirect-dialling, three-way calling, speed-calling, call-\r\nwaiting, Caller ID, all the rest of the cornucopia\r\nof digital bounty.  Replacing computers with operators\r\nis simply not an option any more.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we still, anachronistically, expect humans to\r\nbe running our phone system.  It is hard for us\r\nto understand that we have sacrificed huge amounts\r\nof initiative and control to senseless yet powerful machines.\r\nWhen the phones fail, we want somebody to be responsible.\r\nWe want somebody to blame.\r\n\r\nWhen the Crash of January 15 happened, the American populace\r\nwas simply not prepared to understand that enormous landslides\r\nin cyberspace, like the Crash itself, can happen,\r\nand can be nobody's fault in particular.  It was easier to believe,\r\nmaybe even in some odd way more reassuring to believe,\r\nthat some evil person, or evil group, had done this to us.\r\n\"Hackers\" had done it.  With a virus.  A trojan horse.\r\nA software bomb.  A dirty plot of some kind.  People believed this,\r\nresponsible people.  In 1990, they were looking hard for evidence\r\nto confirm their heartfelt suspicions.\r\n\r\nAnd they would look in a lot of places.\r\n\r\nCome 1991, however, the outlines of an apparent new reality\r\nwould begin to emerge from the fog.\r\n\r\nOn July 1 and 2, 1991, computer-software collapses\r\nin telephone switching stations disrupted service in\r\nWashington DC, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\r\nOnce again, seemingly minor maintenance problems had\r\ncrippled the digital System 7.  About twelve million\r\npeople were affected in the Crash of July 1, 1991.\r\n\r\nSaid the New York Times Service:  \"Telephone company executives\r\nand federal regulators said they were not ruling out the possibility\r\nof sabotage by computer hackers, but most seemed to think the problems\r\nstemmed from some unknown defect in the software running the networks.\"\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, within the week, a red-faced software company,\r\nDSC Communications Corporation of Plano, Texas, owned up\r\nto \"glitches\" in the \"signal transfer point\" software that\r\nDSC had designed for Bell Atlantic and Pacific Bell.\r\nThe immediate cause of the July 1 Crash was a single\r\nmistyped character:  one tiny typographical flaw\r\nin one single line of the software.  One mistyped letter,\r\nin one single line, had deprived the nation's capital of phone service.\r\nIt was not particularly surprising that this tiny flaw had escaped attention:\r\na typical System 7 station requires TEN MILLION lines of code.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, September 17, 1991, came the most spectacular outage yet.\r\nThis case had nothing to do with software failures--at least, not directly.\r\nInstead, a group of AT&T's switching stations in New York City had simply\r\nrun out of electrical power and shut down cold.  Their back-up batteries\r\nhad failed.  Automatic warning systems were supposed to warn of the loss\r\nof battery power, but those automatic systems had failed as well.\r\n\r\nThis time, Kennedy, La Guardia, and Newark airports\r\nall had their voice and data communications cut.\r\nThis horrifying event was particularly ironic, as attacks\r\non airport computers by hackers had long been a standard\r\nnightmare scenario, much trumpeted by computer-security\r\nexperts who feared the computer underground.  There had even\r\nbeen a Hollywood thriller about sinister hackers ruining\r\nairport computers--DIE HARD II.\r\n\r\nNow AT&T itself had crippled airports with computer malfunctions--\r\nnot just one airport, but three at once, some of the busiest in the world.\r\n\r\nAir traffic came to a standstill throughout the Greater New York area,\r\ncausing more than 500 flights to be cancelled, in a spreading wave\r\nall over America and even into Europe.  Another 500 or so flights\r\nwere delayed, affecting, all in all, about 85,000 passengers.\r\n(One of these passengers was the chairman of the Federal\r\nCommunications Commission.)\r\n\r\nStranded passengers in New York and New Jersey were further\r\ninfuriated to discover that they could not even manage to\r\nmake a long distance phone call, to explain their delay\r\nto loved ones or business associates.  Thanks to the crash,\r\nabout four and a half million domestic calls, and half a million\r\ninternational calls, failed to get through.\r\n\r\nThe September 17 NYC Crash, unlike the previous ones,\r\ninvolved not a whisper of \"hacker\" misdeeds.  On the contrary,\r\nby 1991, AT&T itself was suffering much of the vilification\r\nthat had formerly been directed at hackers.  Congressmen were grumbling.\r\nSo were state and federal regulators.  And so was the press.\r\n\r\nFor their part, ancient rival MCI took out snide full-page\r\nnewspaper ads in New York, offering their own long-distance\r\nservices for the \"next time that AT&T goes down.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't find a classy company like AT&T using such advertising,\"\r\nprotested AT&T Chairman Robert Allen, unconvincingly.  Once again,\r\nout came the full-page AT&T apologies in newspapers, apologies for\r\n\"an inexcusable culmination of both human and mechanical failure.\"\r\n(This time, however, AT&T offered no discount on later calls.\r\nUnkind critics suggested that AT&T were worried about setting any precedent\r\nfor refunding the financial losses caused by telephone crashes.)\r\n\r\nIndustry journals asked publicly if AT&T was \"asleep at the switch.\"\r\nThe telephone network, America's purported marvel of high-tech reliability,\r\nhad gone down three times in 18 months.  Fortune magazine listed the\r\nCrash of September 17 among the \"Biggest Business Goofs of 1991,\"\r\ncruelly parodying AT&T's ad campaign in an article entitled\r\n\"AT&T Wants You Back (Safely On the Ground, God Willing).\"\r\n\r\nWhy had those New York switching systems simply run out of power?\r\nBecause no human being had attended to the alarm system.\r\nWhy did the alarm systems blare automatically,\r\nwithout any human being noticing?  Because the three\r\ntelco technicians who SHOULD have been listening\r\nwere absent from their stations in the power-room,\r\non another floor of the building--attending a training class.\r\nA training class about the alarm systems for the power room!\r\n\r\n\"Crashing the System\" was no longer \"unprecedented\" by late 1991.\r\nOn the contrary, it no longer even seemed an oddity.  By 1991,\r\nit was clear that all the policemen in the world could no longer\r\n\"protect\" the phone system from crashes.  By far the worst crashes\r\nthe system had ever had, had been inflicted, by the system,\r\nupon ITSELF.  And this time nobody was making cocksure statements\r\nthat this was an anomaly, something that would never happen again.\r\nBy 1991 the System's defenders had met their nebulous Enemy,\r\nand the Enemy was--the System.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO:  THE DIGITAL UNDERGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe date was May 9, 1990.  The Pope was touring Mexico City.\r\nHustlers from the Medellin Cartel were trying to buy\r\nblack-market Stinger missiles in Florida.  On the comics page,\r\nDoonesbury character Andy was dying of AIDS.  And then. . .a highly\r\nunusual item whose novelty and calculated rhetoric won it\r\nheadscratching attention in newspapers all over America.\r\n\r\nThe US Attorney's office in Phoenix, Arizona, had issued\r\na press release announcing a nationwide law enforcement crackdown\r\nagainst \"illegal computer hacking activities.\"  The sweep was\r\nofficially known as \"Operation Sundevil.\"\r\n\r\nEight paragraphs in the press release gave the bare facts:\r\ntwenty-seven search warrants carried out on May 8, with three arrests,\r\nand a hundred and fifty agents on the prowl in \"twelve\" cities across America.\r\n(Different counts in local press reports yielded \"thirteen,\" \"fourteen,\" and\r\n\"sixteen\" cities.)  Officials estimated that criminal losses of revenue\r\nto telephone companies \"may run into millions of dollars.\"  Credit for\r\nthe Sundevil investigations was taken by the US Secret Service,\r\nAssistant US Attorney Tim Holtzen of Phoenix, and the Assistant\r\nAttorney General of Arizona, Gail Thackeray.\r\n\r\nThe prepared remarks of Garry M. Jenkins, appearing in a U.S. Department\r\nof Justice press release, were of particular interest.  Mr. Jenkins was the\r\nAssistant Director of the US Secret Service, and the highest-ranking federal\r\nofficial to take any direct public role in  the hacker crackdown of 1990.\r\n\r\n\"Today, the Secret Service is sending a clear message to those computer hackers\r\nwho have decided to violate the laws of this nation in the mistaken belief\r\nthat they can successfully avoid detection by hiding behind the relative\r\nanonymity of their computer terminals. (. . .)  \"Underground groups have been\r\nformed for the purpose of exchanging information relevant to their criminal\r\nactivities.  These groups often communicate with each other through message\r\nsystems between computers called `bulletin boards.'  \"Our experience shows\r\nthat many computer hacker suspects are no longer misguided teenagers,\r\nmischievously playing games with their computers in their bedrooms.\r\nSome are now high tech computer operators using computers to engage\r\nin unlawful conduct.\"\r\n\r\nWho were these \"underground groups\" and \"high-tech operators?\"\r\nWhere had they come from?  What did they want?  Who WERE they?\r\nWere they \"mischievous?\"  Were they dangerous?  How had \"misguided teenagers\"\r\nmanaged to alarm the United States Secret Service?  And just how widespread\r\nwas this sort of thing?\r\n\r\nOf all the major players in the Hacker Crackdown: the phone companies,\r\nlaw enforcement, the civil libertarians, and the \"hackers\" themselves--\r\nthe \"hackers\" are by far the most mysterious, by far the hardest to\r\nunderstand, by far the WEIRDEST.\r\n\r\nNot only are \"hackers\"  novel in their activities, but they come\r\nin a variety of odd subcultures, with a variety of languages,\r\nmotives and values.\r\n\r\nThe earliest proto-hackers were probably those unsung mischievous\r\ntelegraph boys who were summarily fired by the Bell Company in 1878.\r\n\r\nLegitimate \"hackers,\" those computer enthusiasts who are independent-minded\r\nbut law-abiding, generally trace their spiritual ancestry to elite technical\r\nuniversities, especially M.I.T. and Stanford, in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nBut the genuine roots of the modern hacker UNDERGROUND can probably be traced\r\nmost successfully to a now much-obscured hippie anarchist movement known as\r\nthe Yippies.  The  Yippies, who took their name from the largely fictional\r\n\"Youth International Party,\" carried out a loud and lively policy of surrealistic\r\nsubversion and outrageous political mischief.  Their basic tenets were flagrant\r\nsexual promiscuity, open and copious drug use, the political overthrow of any\r\npowermonger over thirty years of age, and an immediate end to the war\r\nin Vietnam, by any means necessary, including the psychic levitation\r\nof the Pentagon.\r\n\r\nThe two most visible Yippies were Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.\r\nRubin eventually became a Wall Street broker.  Hoffman, ardently sought\r\nby federal authorities, went into hiding for seven years,\r\nin Mexico, France, and the United States.  While on the lam,\r\nHoffman continued to write and publish, with help from sympathizers\r\nin the American anarcho-leftist underground.  Mostly, Hoffman survived\r\nthrough false ID and odd jobs.  Eventually he underwent facial plastic\r\nsurgery and adopted an entirely new identity as one \"Barry Freed.\"\r\nAfter surrendering himself to authorities in 1980, Hoffman spent a year\r\nin prison on a cocaine conviction.\r\n\r\nHoffman's worldview grew much darker as the glory days of the 1960s faded.\r\nIn 1989, he purportedly committed suicide, under odd and, to some, rather\r\nsuspicious circumstances.\r\n\r\nAbbie Hoffman is said to have caused the Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nto amass the single largest investigation file ever opened on an individual\r\nAmerican citizen.  (If this is true, it is still questionable whether the\r\nFBI regarded Abbie Hoffman a serious public threat--quite possibly,\r\nhis file was enormous simply because Hoffman left colorful legendry\r\nwherever he went).  He was a gifted publicist, who regarded electronic\r\nmedia as both playground and weapon.  He actively enjoyed manipulating\r\nnetwork TV and other gullible, image-hungry media, with various weird lies,\r\nmindboggling rumors, impersonation scams, and other sinister distortions,\r\nall absolutely guaranteed to upset cops, Presidential candidates,\r\nand federal judges.  Hoffman's most famous work was a book self-reflexively\r\nknown as STEAL THIS BOOK, which publicized a number of methods by which young,\r\npenniless hippie agitators might live off the fat of a system supported by\r\nhumorless drones. STEAL THIS BOOK, whose title urged readers to damage\r\nthe very means of distribution which had put it into their hands,\r\nmight be described as a spiritual ancestor of a computer virus.\r\n\r\nHoffman, like many a later conspirator, made extensive use of\r\npay-phones for his agitation work--in his case, generally through\r\nthe use of cheap brass washers as coin-slugs.\r\n\r\nDuring the Vietnam War, there was a federal surtax imposed on telephone\r\nservice; Hoffman and his cohorts could, and did, argue that in systematically\r\nstealing phone service they were engaging in civil disobedience:\r\nvirtuously denying tax funds to an illegal and immoral war.\r\n\r\nBut this thin veil of decency was soon dropped entirely.\r\nRipping-off the System  found its own justification in deep alienation\r\nand a basic outlaw contempt for conventional bourgeois values.\r\nIngenious, vaguely politicized varieties of rip-off,\r\nwhich might be described as \"anarchy by convenience,\"\r\nbecame very popular in Yippie circles, and because rip-off\r\nwas so useful, it was to survive the Yippie movement itself.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1970s, it required fairly limited expertise\r\nand ingenuity to cheat payphones, to divert \"free\"\r\nelectricity and gas service, or to rob vending machines\r\nand parking meters for handy pocket change.  It also required\r\na conspiracy to spread this knowledge, and the gall\r\nand nerve actually to commit petty theft, but the Yippies\r\nhad these qualifications in plenty.  In June 1971, Abbie\r\nHoffman and a telephone enthusiast sarcastically known\r\nas \"Al Bell\" began publishing a newsletter called Youth\r\nInternational Party Line.  This newsletter was dedicated\r\nto collating and spreading Yippie rip-off techniques,\r\nespecially of phones, to the joy of the freewheeling\r\nunderground and the insensate rage of all straight people.\r\nAs a political tactic, phone-service theft ensured\r\nthat Yippie advocates would always have ready access\r\nto the long-distance telephone as a medium, despite\r\nthe Yippies' chronic lack of organization, discipline,\r\nmoney, or even a steady home address.\r\n\r\nPARTY LINE was run out of Greenwich Village for a couple of years,\r\nthen \"Al Bell\" more or less defected from the faltering ranks of Yippiedom,\r\nchanging the newsletter's name to TAP or Technical Assistance Program.\r\nAfter the Vietnam War ended, the steam began leaking rapidly out of American\r\nradical dissent. But  by this time, \"Bell\" and his dozen or so\r\ncore contributors  had the bit between their teeth,\r\nand had begun to derive tremendous gut-level satisfaction\r\nfrom the sensation of pure TECHNICAL POWER.\r\n\r\nTAP articles, once highly politicized, became pitilessly jargonized\r\nand technical, in homage or parody to the Bell System's own technical\r\ndocuments, which TAP studied closely, gutted, and reproduced without\r\npermission.  The TAP elite revelled in gloating possession\r\nof the specialized knowledge necessary to beat the system.\r\n\r\n\"Al Bell\" dropped out of the game by the late 70s,\r\nand \"Tom Edison\" took over; TAP readers (some 1400 of\r\nthem, all told) now began to show more interest in telex\r\nswitches and the growing phenomenon of computer systems.\r\n\r\nIn 1983, \"Tom Edison\" had his computer stolen and his house\r\nset on fire by an arsonist.  This was an eventually mortal blow\r\nto TAP (though the legendary name was to be resurrected\r\nin 1990 by a young Kentuckian computer-outlaw named \"Predat0r.\")\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nEver since telephones began to make money, there have been\r\npeople willing to rob and defraud phone companies.\r\nThe legions of petty phone thieves vastly outnumber those\r\n\"phone phreaks\" who  \"explore the system\" for the sake\r\nof the intellectual challenge.  The New York metropolitan area\r\n(long in the vanguard of American crime) claims over 150,000\r\nphysical attacks on pay telephones every year!  Studied carefully,\r\na modern payphone reveals itself as a little fortress, carefully\r\ndesigned and redesigned over generations, to resist coin-slugs,\r\nzaps of electricity, chunks of coin-shaped ice, prybars, magnets,\r\nlockpicks, blasting caps.  Public pay- phones must survive in a world\r\nof unfriendly, greedy people, and a modern payphone is as exquisitely\r\nevolved as a cactus.\r\nBecause the phone network pre-dates the computer network,\r\nthe scofflaws known as \"phone phreaks\" pre-date the scofflaws\r\nknown as \"computer hackers.\"  In practice, today, the line\r\nbetween \"phreaking\" and \"hacking\" is very blurred,\r\njust as the distinction between telephones and computers\r\nhas blurred.  The phone system has been digitized,\r\nand computers have learned to \"talk\" over phone-lines.\r\nWhat's worse--and this was the point of the Mr. Jenkins\r\nof the Secret Service--some hackers have learned to steal,\r\nand some thieves have learned to hack.\r\n\r\nDespite the blurring, one can still draw a few useful\r\nbehavioral distinctions between \"phreaks\" and \"hackers.\"\r\nHackers are intensely interested in the \"system\" per se,\r\nand enjoy relating to machines.  \"Phreaks\" are more\r\nsocial, manipulating the system in a rough-and-ready\r\nfashion in order to get through to other human beings,\r\nfast, cheap and under the table.\r\n\r\nPhone phreaks love nothing so much as \"bridges,\"\r\nillegal conference calls of ten or twelve chatting\r\nconspirators, seaboard to seaboard, lasting for many hours\r\n--and running, of course, on somebody else's tab,\r\npreferably a large corporation's.\r\n\r\nAs phone-phreak conferences wear on, people drop out\r\n(or simply leave the phone off the hook, while they\r\nsashay off to work or school or babysitting),\r\nand new people are phoned up and invited to join in,\r\nfrom some other continent, if possible.  Technical trivia,\r\nboasts, brags, lies, head-trip deceptions, weird rumors,\r\nand cruel gossip are all freely exchanged.\r\n\r\nThe lowest rung of phone-phreaking is the theft of telephone access codes.\r\nCharging a phone call to somebody else's stolen number is, of course,\r\na pig-easy way of stealing phone service, requiring practically no\r\ntechnical expertise.  This practice has been very widespread,\r\nespecially among lonely people without much money who are far from home.\r\nCode theft has flourished especially in college dorms, military bases,\r\nand, notoriously, among roadies for rock bands.  Of late, code theft\r\nhas spread very rapidly among Third Worlders in the US, who pile up\r\nenormous unpaid long-distance bills to the Caribbean, South America,\r\nand Pakistan.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to steal phone-codes is simply to look over\r\na victim's shoulder as he punches-in his own code-number\r\non a public payphone.  This technique is known as \"shoulder-surfing,\"\r\nand is especially common in airports, bus terminals, and train stations.\r\nThe code is then sold by the thief for a few dollars.  The buyer abusing\r\nthe code has no computer expertise, but calls his Mom in New York,\r\nKingston or Caracas and runs up a huge bill with impunity.  The losses\r\nfrom this primitive phreaking activity are far, far greater than the\r\nmonetary losses caused by computer-intruding hackers.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, until the introduction of sterner telco\r\nsecurity measures, COMPUTERIZED code theft worked like a charm,\r\nand was virtually omnipresent throughout the digital underground,\r\namong phreaks and hackers alike.  This was accomplished through\r\nprogramming one's computer to try random code numbers over the telephone\r\nuntil one of them worked.  Simple programs to do this were widely available\r\nin the underground; a computer running all night was likely to come up with\r\na dozen or so useful hits.  This could be repeated week after week until\r\none had a large library of stolen codes.\r\n\r\nNowadays, the computerized dialling of hundreds of numbers\r\ncan be detected within hours and swiftly traced.\r\nIf a stolen code is repeatedly abused, this too can\r\nbe detected within a few hours.  But for years in the 1980s,\r\nthe publication of stolen codes was a kind of elementary etiquette\r\nfor fledgling hackers.  The simplest way to establish your bona-fides\r\nas a raider was to steal a code through repeated random dialling\r\nand offer it to the \"community\" for use.  Codes could be both stolen,\r\nand used, simply and easily from the safety of one's own bedroom,\r\nwith very little fear of detection or punishment.\r\n\r\nBefore computers and their phone-line modems entered American homes\r\nin gigantic numbers, phone phreaks had their own special telecommunications\r\nhardware gadget, the famous \"blue box.\"  This fraud device (now rendered\r\nincreasingly useless by the digital evolution of the phone system) could\r\ntrick switching systems into granting free access to long-distance lines.\r\nIt did this by mimicking the system's own signal, a tone of 2600 hertz.\r\n\r\nSteven Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the founders of Apple Computer, Inc.,\r\nonce dabbled in selling blue-boxes in college dorms in California.\r\nFor many, in the early days of phreaking, blue-boxing was scarcely\r\nperceived as \"theft,\" but rather as a fun (if sneaky) way to use\r\nexcess phone capacity harmlessly.  After all, the long-distance\r\nlines were JUST SITTING THERE. . . .  Whom did it hurt, really?\r\nIf you're not DAMAGING the system, and  you're not USING UP ANY\r\nTANGIBLE RESOURCE, and if nobody FINDS OUT what you did,\r\nthen what real harm have you done? What exactly HAVE you \"stolen,\"\r\nanyway?  If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it,\r\nhow much is the noise worth?  Even now this remains a rather\r\ndicey question.\r\n\r\nBlue-boxing was no joke to the phone companies, however.\r\nIndeed, when Ramparts magazine, a radical publication in California,\r\nprinted the wiring schematics necessary to create a mute box in June 1972,\r\nthe magazine was seized by police and Pacific Bell phone-company officials.\r\nThe mute box, a blue-box variant, allowed its user to receive long-distance\r\ncalls free of charge to the caller.  This device was closely described in a\r\nRamparts article wryly titled \"Regulating the Phone Company In Your Home.\"\r\nPublication of this article was held to be in violation of Californian\r\nState Penal Code section 502.7, which outlaws ownership of wire-fraud\r\ndevices and the selling of \"plans or instructions for any instrument,\r\napparatus, or device intended to avoid telephone toll charges.\"\r\n\r\nIssues of Ramparts were recalled or seized on the newsstands,\r\nand the resultant loss of income helped put the magazine out of business.\r\nThis was an ominous precedent for free-expression issues, but the telco's\r\ncrushing of a radical-fringe magazine passed without serious challenge\r\nat the time.  Even in the freewheeling California 1970s, it was widely felt\r\nthat there was something sacrosanct about what the phone company knew;\r\nthat the telco had a legal and moral right to protect itself by shutting\r\noff the flow of such illicit information.  Most telco information was so\r\n\"specialized\" that it would scarcely be understood by any honest member\r\nof the public.  If not published, it would not be missed.  To print such\r\nmaterial did not seem part of the legitimate role of a free press.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 there would be a similar telco-inspired attack\r\non the electronic phreak/hacking \"magazine\" Phrack.\r\nThe Phrack legal case became a central issue in the\r\nHacker Crackdown, and gave rise to great controversy.\r\nPhrack would also be shut down, for a  time, at least,\r\nbut this time both the telcos and their law-enforcement\r\nallies would pay a much larger price for their actions.\r\nThe Phrack case will be examined in detail, later.\r\n\r\nPhone-phreaking as a social practice is still very\r\nmuch alive at this moment.  Today, phone-phreaking\r\nis thriving much more vigorously than the better-known\r\nand worse-feared practice of \"computer hacking.\"\r\nNew forms of phreaking are spreading rapidly, following\r\nnew vulnerabilities in sophisticated phone services.\r\n\r\nCellular phones are especially vulnerable; their chips\r\ncan be re-programmed to present a false caller ID\r\nand avoid billing.  Doing so also avoids police tapping,\r\nmaking cellular-phone abuse a favorite among drug-dealers.\r\n\"Call-sell operations\" using pirate cellular phones can,\r\nand have, been run right out of the backs of cars, which move\r\nfrom \"cell\" to \"cell\" in the local phone system, retailing\r\nstolen long-distance service, like some kind of demented\r\nelectronic version of the neighborhood ice-cream truck.\r\n\r\nPrivate branch-exchange phone systems in large corporations\r\ncan be penetrated; phreaks dial-up a local company, enter its\r\ninternal phone-system, hack it, then use the company's own\r\nPBX system to dial back out over the public network,\r\ncausing the company to be stuck with the resulting\r\nlong-distance bill.  This technique is known as \"diverting.\"\r\n\"Diverting\" can be very costly, especially because phreaks\r\ntend to travel in packs and never stop talking.\r\nPerhaps the worst by-product of this \"PBX fraud\"\r\nis that victim companies and telcos have sued one another\r\nover the financial responsibility for the stolen calls,\r\nthus enriching not only shabby phreaks but well-paid lawyers.\r\n\r\n\"Voice-mail systems\" can also be abused; phreaks\r\ncan seize their own sections of these sophisticated\r\nelectronic answering machines, and use them for trading\r\ncodes or knowledge of illegal techniques.  Voice-mail\r\nabuse does not hurt the company directly, but finding\r\nsupposedly empty slots in your company's answering\r\nmachine all crammed with phreaks eagerly chattering\r\nand hey-duding one another in impenetrable jargon can\r\ncause sensations of almost mystical repulsion and dread.\r\n\r\nWorse yet, phreaks have sometimes been known to react\r\ntruculently to attempts to \"clean up\" the voice-mail system.\r\nRather than humbly acquiescing to being thrown out of their playground,\r\nthey may very well call up the company officials at work (or at home)\r\nand loudly demand free voice-mail addresses of their very own.\r\nSuch bullying is taken very seriously by spooked victims.\r\n\r\nActs of phreak revenge against straight people are rare,\r\nbut voice-mail systems are especially tempting and vulnerable,\r\nand an infestation of angry phreaks in one's voice-mail system is no joke.\r\nThey can erase legitimate messages; or spy on private messages;\r\nor harass users with recorded taunts and  obscenities.\r\nThey've even been known to seize control of voice-mail security,\r\nand lock out legitimate users, or even shut down the system entirely.\r\n\r\nCellular phone-calls, cordless phones, and ship-to-shore\r\ntelephony can all be monitored by various forms of radio;\r\nthis kind of \"passive monitoring\" is spreading explosively today.\r\nTechnically eavesdropping on other people's cordless and cellular\r\nphone-calls is the fastest-growing area in phreaking today.\r\nThis practice strongly appeals to the lust for power and conveys\r\ngratifying sensations of technical superiority over the eavesdropping\r\nvictim.  Monitoring is rife with all manner of tempting evil mischief.\r\nSimple prurient snooping is by far the most common activity.\r\nBut credit-card numbers unwarily spoken over the phone can be recorded,\r\nstolen and used.  And tapping people's phone-calls (whether through\r\nactive telephone taps or passive radio monitors) does lend itself\r\nconveniently to activities like blackmail, industrial espionage,\r\nand political dirty tricks.\r\n\r\nIt should be repeated that telecommunications fraud,\r\nthe theft of phone service, causes vastly greater monetary\r\nlosses than the practice of entering into computers by stealth.\r\nHackers are mostly young suburban American white males,\r\nand exist in their hundreds--but \"phreaks\" come from both sexes\r\nand from many nationalities, ages and ethnic backgrounds,\r\nand are flourishing in the thousands.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe term \"hacker\" has had an unfortunate history.\r\nThis book, The Hacker Crackdown, has little to say about\r\n\"hacking\" in its finer, original sense.  The term  can signify\r\nthe free-wheeling intellectual exploration of the highest\r\nand deepest potential of computer systems.  Hacking can\r\ndescribe the determination to make access to computers\r\nand information as free and open as possible.  Hacking\r\ncan involve the heartfelt conviction that beauty can\r\nbe found in computers, that the fine aesthetic in a perfect\r\nprogram can liberate the mind and spirit.  This is \"hacking\"\r\nas it was defined in Steven Levy's much-praised history\r\nof the pioneer computer milieu, Hackers, published in 1984.\r\n\r\nHackers of all kinds are absolutely soaked through with heroic\r\nanti-bureaucratic sentiment.  Hackers long for recognition\r\nas a praiseworthy cultural archetype, the postmodern electronic\r\nequivalent of the cowboy and mountain man.  Whether they deserve\r\nsuch a reputation is something for history to decide.  But many hackers--\r\nincluding those outlaw hackers who are computer intruders, and whose\r\nactivities are defined as criminal--actually attempt to LIVE UP TO\r\nthis techno-cowboy reputation.  And given that electronics and\r\ntelecommunications are still largely unexplored territories,\r\nthere is simply NO TELLING what hackers might uncover.\r\n\r\nFor some people, this freedom is the very breath of oxygen,\r\nthe inventive spontaneity that makes life worth living\r\nand that flings open doors to marvellous possibility and\r\nindividual empowerment.  But for many people\r\n--and increasingly so--the hacker is an ominous figure,\r\na smart-aleck sociopath ready to burst out of his basement\r\nwilderness and savage other people's lives for his own\r\nanarchical convenience.\r\n\r\nAny form of power without responsibility, without direct\r\nand formal checks and balances, is frightening to people--\r\nand reasonably so.  It should be frankly admitted that\r\nhackers ARE frightening, and that the basis of this fear\r\nis not irrational.\r\n\r\nFear of hackers goes well beyond the fear of merely criminal activity.\r\n\r\nSubversion and manipulation of the phone system\r\nis an act with disturbing political overtones.\r\nIn America, computers and telephones are potent symbols\r\nof organized authority and the technocratic business elite.\r\n\r\nBut there is an element in American culture that\r\nhas always strongly rebelled against these symbols;\r\nrebelled against all large industrial computers\r\nand all phone companies.  A certain anarchical tinge deep\r\nin the American soul delights in causing confusion and pain\r\nto all bureaucracies, including technological ones.\r\n\r\nThere is sometimes malice and vandalism in this attitude,\r\nbut it is a deep and cherished part of the American national character.\r\nThe outlaw, the rebel, the rugged individual, the pioneer,\r\nthe sturdy Jeffersonian yeoman, the private citizen resisting\r\ninterference in his pursuit of happiness--these are figures that all\r\nAmericans recognize, and that many will strongly applaud and defend.\r\n\r\nMany scrupulously law-abiding citizens today do cutting-edge work\r\nwith electronics--work that has already had tremendous social influence\r\nand will have much more in years to come.  In all truth, these talented,\r\nhardworking, law-abiding, mature, adult people are far more disturbing\r\nto the peace and order of the current status quo than any scofflaw group\r\nof romantic teenage punk kids.  These law-abiding hackers have the power,\r\nability, and willingness to influence other people's lives quite unpredictably.\r\nThey have means, motive, and opportunity to meddle drastically with the\r\nAmerican social order.  When corralled into governments, universities,\r\nor large multinational companies, and forced to follow rulebooks\r\nand wear suits and ties, they at least have some conventional halters\r\non their freedom of action.  But when loosed alone, or in small groups,\r\nand fired by imagination and the entrepreneurial spirit, they can move\r\nmountains--causing landslides that will likely crash directly into your\r\noffice and living room.\r\n\r\nThese people, as a class, instinctively recognize that a public,\r\npoliticized attack on hackers will eventually spread to them--\r\nthat the term \"hacker,\"  once demonized, might be used to knock\r\ntheir hands off the levers of power and choke them out of existence.\r\nThere are hackers today who fiercely and publicly resist any besmirching\r\nof the noble title of hacker.  Naturally and understandably, they deeply\r\nresent the attack on their values implicit in using the word \"hacker\"\r\nas a synonym for computer-criminal.\r\n\r\nThis book, sadly but in my opinion unavoidably, rather adds\r\nto the degradation of the term.  It concerns itself mostly with \"hacking\"\r\nin its commonest latter-day definition, i.e., intruding into computer\r\nsystems by stealth and without permission.  The term \"hacking\" is used\r\nroutinely today  by almost all law enforcement officials with any\r\nprofessional interest in computer fraud  and abuse.  American police\r\ndescribe almost any crime committed with, by, through, or against\r\na computer as hacking.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, \"hacker\" is what computer-intruders\r\nchoose to call THEMSELVES.  Nobody who \"hacks\" into systems\r\nwillingly describes himself (rarely, herself) as a \"computer intruder,\"\r\n\"computer trespasser,\" \"cracker,\" \"wormer,\" \"darkside hacker\"\r\nor \"high tech street gangster.\"  Several other demeaning terms\r\nhave been invented  in the hope that the press and public\r\nwill leave the original sense of the word alone.  But few people\r\nactually use these terms.  (I exempt the term \"cyberpunk,\"\r\nwhich a few hackers and law enforcement people actually do use.\r\nThe term \"cyberpunk\" is drawn from literary criticism and has\r\nsome odd and unlikely resonances, but, like hacker,\r\ncyberpunk too has become a criminal pejorative today.)\r\n\r\nIn any case, breaking into computer systems was hardly alien\r\nto the original hacker tradition.  The first tottering systems\r\nof the 1960s  required fairly extensive internal surgery merely\r\nto function day-by-day.  Their users \"invaded\" the deepest,\r\nmost arcane recesses of their operating software almost\r\nas a matter of routine. \"Computer security\" in these early,\r\nprimitive systems was at best an afterthought.  What security\r\nthere was, was entirely physical, for it was assumed that\r\nanyone allowed near this expensive, arcane hardware would be\r\na fully qualified professional expert.\r\n\r\nIn a campus environment, though, this meant that grad students,\r\nteaching assistants, undergraduates, and eventually,\r\nall manner of dropouts and hangers-on ended up accessing\r\nand often running the works.\r\n\r\nUniversities, even modern universities, are not in\r\nthe business of maintaining security over information.\r\nOn the contrary, universities, as institutions, pre-date\r\nthe \"information economy\" by many centuries and are not-\r\nfor-profit cultural entities, whose reason for existence\r\n(purportedly) is to discover truth, codify it through\r\ntechniques of scholarship, and then teach it.  Universities\r\nare meant to PASS THE TORCH OF CIVILIZATION, not just\r\ndownload data into student skulls, and the values of the\r\nacademic community are strongly at odds with those of all\r\nwould-be information empires.  Teachers at all levels, from\r\nkindergarten up, have proven to be shameless and persistent\r\nsoftware and data pirates.  Universities do not merely\r\n\"leak information\" but vigorously broadcast free thought.\r\n\r\nThis clash of values has been fraught with controversy.\r\nMany hackers of the 1960s remember their professional\r\napprenticeship as a long guerilla war against the uptight\r\nmainframe-computer \"information priesthood.\"  These computer-hungry\r\nyoungsters had to struggle hard for access to computing power,\r\nand many of them were not above certain, er, shortcuts.\r\nBut, over the years, this practice freed computing\r\nfrom the sterile reserve of lab-coated technocrats and\r\nwas largely responsible for the explosive growth of computing\r\nin general society--especially PERSONAL computing.\r\n\r\nAccess to technical power acted like catnip on certain\r\nof these youngsters.  Most of the basic techniques of\r\ncomputer intrusion: password cracking, trapdoors, backdoors,\r\ntrojan horses--were invented in college environments in the 1960s,\r\nin the early days of network computing.  Some off-the-cuff\r\nexperience at computer intrusion was to be in the informal\r\nresume of most \"hackers\" and many future industry giants.\r\nOutside of the tiny cult of computer enthusiasts, few people\r\nthought much about  the implications of \"breaking into\"\r\ncomputers.  This sort of activity had not yet been publicized,\r\nmuch less criminalized.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s, definitions of \"property\" and \"privacy\"\r\nhad not yet been extended to cyberspace.  Computers\r\nwere not yet indispensable to society.  There were no vast\r\ndatabanks of vulnerable, proprietary information stored\r\nin computers, which might be accessed, copied without\r\npermission, erased, altered, or sabotaged.  The stakes\r\nwere low in the early days--but they grew every year,\r\nexponentially, as computers themselves grew.\r\n\r\nBy the 1990s, commercial and political pressures\r\nhad become overwhelming, and they broke the social\r\nboundaries of the hacking subculture.  Hacking\r\nhad become too important to be left to the  hackers.\r\nSociety was now forced to tackle the intangible nature\r\nof cyberspace-as-property, cyberspace as privately-owned\r\nunreal-estate.  In the  new, severe, responsible, high-stakes\r\ncontext of the \"Information Society\" of the 1990s,\r\n\"hacking\" was called into question.\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean to break into a computer without\r\npermission and use its computational power, or look\r\naround inside its files without hurting anything?\r\nWhat were computer-intruding hackers, anyway--how should\r\nsociety, and the law, best define their actions?\r\nWere they just BROWSERS, harmless intellectual explorers?\r\nWere they VOYEURS, snoops, invaders of privacy?  Should\r\nthey be sternly treated as potential AGENTS OF ESPIONAGE,\r\nor perhaps as INDUSTRIAL SPIES? Or were they best\r\ndefined as TRESPASSERS, a very common teenage\r\nmisdemeanor?  Was hacking THEFT OF SERVICE?\r\n(After all, intruders were getting someone else's\r\ncomputer to carry out their orders, without permission\r\nand without paying).  Was hacking FRAUD?  Maybe it was\r\nbest described as IMPERSONATION.  The commonest mode\r\nof computer intrusion was (and is) to swipe or snoop\r\nsomebody else's password, and then enter the computer\r\nin the guise of another person--who is commonly stuck\r\nwith the blame and the bills.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a medical metaphor was better--hackers should\r\nbe defined as \"sick,\" as COMPUTER ADDICTS unable\r\nto control their irresponsible, compulsive behavior.\r\n\r\nBut these weighty assessments meant little to the\r\npeople who were actually being judged.  From inside\r\nthe underground world of hacking itself, all these\r\nperceptions seem quaint, wrongheaded, stupid, or meaningless.\r\nThe most important self-perception of underground hackers--\r\nfrom the 1960s, right through to the present day--is that\r\nthey are an ELITE.  The day-to-day struggle in the underground\r\nis not over sociological definitions--who cares?--but for power,\r\nknowledge, and  status among one's peers.\r\n\r\nWhen you are a hacker, it is your own inner conviction\r\nof your elite status that enables you to break, or let\r\nus say \"transcend,\" the rules.  It is not that ALL rules\r\ngo by the board.  The rules habitually broken by hackers\r\nare UNIMPORTANT rules--the rules of dopey greedhead telco\r\nbureaucrats and pig-ignorant government pests.\r\n\r\nHackers have their OWN rules, which separate behavior\r\nwhich is cool and elite, from behavior which is rodentlike,\r\nstupid and losing.  These \"rules,\" however, are mostly unwritten\r\nand enforced by peer pressure and tribal feeling.  Like all rules\r\nthat depend on the unspoken conviction that everybody else\r\nis a good old boy, these rules are ripe for abuse.  The mechanisms\r\nof hacker peer- pressure, \"teletrials\" and ostracism, are rarely used\r\nand rarely work.  Back-stabbing slander, threats, and electronic\r\nharassment are also freely employed in down-and-dirty intrahacker feuds,\r\nbut this rarely forces a rival out of the scene entirely.  The only real\r\nsolution for the problem of an utterly losing, treacherous and rodentlike\r\nhacker is to TURN HIM IN TO THE POLICE.  Unlike the Mafia or Medellin Cartel,\r\nthe hacker elite cannot simply execute the bigmouths, creeps and troublemakers\r\namong their ranks, so they turn one another in with astonishing frequency.\r\n\r\nThere is no tradition of silence or OMERTA in the hacker underworld.\r\nHackers can be shy, even reclusive, but when they do talk, hackers\r\ntend to brag, boast and strut.  Almost everything hackers do is INVISIBLE;\r\nif they don't brag, boast, and strut about it, then NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW.\r\nIf you don't have something to brag, boast, and strut about, then nobody\r\nin the underground will recognize you and favor you with vital cooperation\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nThe way to win a solid reputation in the underground\r\nis by telling other hackers things that could only\r\nhave been learned by exceptional cunning and stealth.\r\nForbidden knowledge, therefore, is the basic currency\r\nof the digital underground, like seashells among\r\nTrobriand Islanders.  Hackers hoard this knowledge,\r\nand dwell upon it obsessively, and refine it,\r\nand bargain with it, and talk and talk about it.\r\n\r\nMany hackers even suffer from a strange obsession to TEACH--\r\nto spread the ethos and the knowledge of the digital underground.\r\nThey'll do this even when it gains them no particular advantage\r\nand presents a grave personal risk.\r\n\r\nAnd when that risk catches up with them, they will go right on teaching\r\nand preaching--to a new audience this time, their interrogators from law\r\nenforcement.  Almost every hacker arrested tells everything he knows--\r\nall about his friends, his mentors, his disciples--legends, threats,\r\nhorror stories, dire rumors, gossip, hallucinations.  This is, of course,\r\nconvenient for law enforcement--except when law enforcement begins\r\nto believe hacker legendry.\r\n\r\nPhone phreaks are unique among criminals in their willingness\r\nto call up law enforcement officials--in the office, at their homes--\r\nand give them an extended piece of their mind.  It is hard not to\r\ninterpret this as BEGGING FOR ARREST, and in fact it is an act\r\nof incredible foolhardiness.  Police are naturally nettled\r\nby these acts of chutzpah and will go well out of their way\r\nto bust these flaunting idiots.  But it can also be interpreted\r\nas a product of a world-view so elitist, so closed and hermetic,\r\nthat electronic police are simply not perceived as \"police,\"\r\nbut rather as ENEMY PHONE PHREAKS who should be scolded\r\ninto behaving \"decently.\"\r\n\r\nHackers at their most grandiloquent perceive themselves\r\nas the elite pioneers of a new electronic world.\r\nAttempts to make them obey the democratically\r\nestablished laws of contemporary American society are\r\nseen as repression and persecution.  After all, they argue,\r\nif Alexander Graham Bell had gone along with the rules\r\nof the Western Union telegraph company, there would have\r\nbeen no telephones.  If Jobs and Wozniak had believed\r\nthat IBM was the be-all and end-all, there would have\r\nbeen no personal computers.  If Benjamin Franklin and\r\nThomas Jefferson had tried to \"work within the system\"\r\nthere would have been no United States.\r\n\r\nNot only do hackers privately believe this as an article of faith,\r\nbut they have been known to write ardent manifestos about it.\r\nHere are some revealing excerpts from an especially vivid hacker manifesto:\r\n\"The Techno-Revolution\" by \"Dr. Crash,\"  which appeared in electronic\r\nform in Phrack Volume 1, Issue 6, Phile 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To fully explain the true motives behind hacking,\r\nwe must first take a quick look into the past.  In the 1960s,\r\na group of MIT students built the first modern computer system.\r\nThis wild, rebellious group of young men were the first to bear\r\nthe name `hackers.'  The systems that they developed were intended\r\nto be used to solve world problems and to benefit all of mankind.\r\n\"As we can see, this has not been the case.  The computer system\r\nhas been solely in the hands of big businesses and the government.\r\nThe wonderful device meant to enrich life has become a weapon which\r\ndehumanizes people.  To the government and large businesses,\r\npeople are no more than disk space, and the government doesn't\r\nuse computers to arrange aid for the poor, but to control nuclear\r\ndeath weapons.  The average American can only have access\r\nto a small microcomputer which is worth only a fraction\r\nof what they pay for it.  The businesses keep the\r\ntrue state-of-the-art equipment away from the people\r\nbehind a steel wall of incredibly high prices and bureaucracy.\r\nIt is because of this state of affairs that hacking was born.  (. . .)\r\n\"Of course, the government doesn't want the monopoly of technology broken,\r\nso they have outlawed hacking and arrest anyone who is caught.  (. . .)\r\nThe phone company is another example of technology abused and kept\r\nfrom people with high prices.  (. . .)  \"Hackers often find that their\r\nexisting equipment, due to the monopoly tactics of computer companies,\r\nis inefficient for their purposes.  Due to the exorbitantly high prices,\r\nit is impossible to legally purchase the necessary equipment.\r\nThis need has given still another segment of the fight:  Credit Carding.\r\nCarding is a way of obtaining the necessary goods without paying for them.\r\nIt is again due to the companies' stupidity that Carding is so easy,\r\nand shows that the world's businesses are in the hands of those\r\nwith considerably less technical know-how than we, the hackers.  (. . .)\r\n\"Hacking must continue.  We must train newcomers to the art of hacking.\r\n(. . . .)  And whatever you do, continue the fight.  Whether you know it\r\nor not, if you are a hacker, you are a revolutionary.  Don't worry,\r\nyou're on the right side.\"\r\n\r\nThe  defense of \"carding\" is rare.  Most hackers regard credit-card\r\ntheft as \"poison\" to the underground, a sleazy and immoral effort that,\r\nworse yet, is hard to get away with.  Nevertheless, manifestos advocating\r\ncredit-card theft, the deliberate crashing of computer systems,\r\nand even acts of violent physical destruction such as vandalism\r\nand arson do exist in the underground.  These boasts and threats\r\nare taken quite seriously by the police.  And not every hacker\r\nis an abstract, Platonic computer-nerd.  Some few are quite experienced\r\nat picking locks, robbing phone-trucks, and breaking and entering buildings.\r\n\r\nHackers vary in their degree of hatred for authority\r\nand the violence of their rhetoric.  But, at a bottom line,\r\nthey are scofflaws.  They don't regard the current rules\r\nof electronic behavior as respectable efforts to preserve\r\nlaw and order and protect public safety.  They regard these\r\nlaws as immoral efforts by soulless corporations to protect\r\ntheir profit margins and to crush dissidents.  \"Stupid\" people,\r\nincluding police, businessmen, politicians, and journalists,\r\nsimply have no right to judge the actions of those possessed of genius,\r\ntechno-revolutionary intentions, and technical expertise.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nHackers are generally teenagers and college kids not\r\nengaged in earning a living.  They often come from fairly\r\nwell-to-do middle-class backgrounds, and are markedly\r\nanti-materialistic (except, that is, when it comes to\r\ncomputer equipment).  Anyone motivated by greed for\r\nmere money (as opposed to the greed for power,\r\nknowledge and status) is swiftly written-off as a narrow-\r\nminded breadhead whose interests can only be corrupt\r\nand contemptible.  Having grown up in the 1970s and\r\n1980s, the young Bohemians of the digital underground\r\nregard straight society as awash in plutocratic corruption,\r\nwhere everyone from the President down is for sale and\r\nwhoever has the gold makes the rules.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, there's a funhouse-mirror image of this attitude\r\non the other side of the conflict.  The police are also\r\none of the most markedly anti-materialistic groups\r\nin American society, motivated not by mere money\r\nbut by ideals of service, justice, esprit-de-corps,\r\nand, of course, their own brand of specialized knowledge\r\nand power.  Remarkably, the propaganda war between cops\r\nand hackers has always involved angry allegations\r\nthat the other side is trying to make a sleazy buck.\r\nHackers consistently sneer that anti-phreak prosecutors\r\nare angling for cushy jobs as telco lawyers and that\r\ncomputer-crime police are aiming to cash in later\r\nas well-paid computer-security consultants in the private sector.\r\n\r\nFor their part, police publicly conflate all\r\nhacking crimes with robbing payphones with crowbars.\r\nAllegations of \"monetary losses\" from computer intrusion\r\nare notoriously inflated.  The act of illicitly copying\r\na document from a computer is morally equated with\r\ndirectly robbing a company of, say, half a million dollars.\r\nThe teenage computer intruder in possession of this \"proprietary\"\r\ndocument has certainly not sold it for such a sum, would likely\r\nhave little idea how to sell it at all, and quite probably\r\ndoesn't even understand what he has.  He has not made a cent\r\nin profit from his felony but is still morally equated with\r\na thief who has robbed the church poorbox and lit out for Brazil.\r\n\r\nPolice want to believe that all hackers are thieves.\r\nIt is a tortuous and almost unbearable act for the American\r\njustice system to put people in jail because they want\r\nto learn things which are forbidden for them to know.\r\nIn an American context, almost any pretext for punishment\r\nis better than jailing people to protect certain restricted\r\nkinds of information.  Nevertheless, POLICING INFORMATION\r\nis part and parcel of the struggle against hackers.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma is well exemplified by the remarkable\r\nactivities of \"Emmanuel Goldstein,\" editor and publisher\r\nof a print magazine known as 2600:  The Hacker Quarterly.\r\nGoldstein was an English major at Long Island's State University\r\nof New York in the '70s, when he became involved with the local\r\ncollege radio station.  His growing interest in electronics\r\ncaused him to drift into Yippie TAP circles and thus into\r\nthe digital underground, where he became a self-described\r\ntechno-rat.  His magazine publishes techniques of computer\r\nintrusion and telephone \"exploration\" as well as gloating\r\nexposes of telco misdeeds and governmental failings.\r\n\r\nGoldstein lives quietly and very privately in a large,\r\ncrumbling Victorian mansion in Setauket, New York.\r\nThe seaside house is decorated with telco decals, chunks of\r\ndriftwood, and the basic bric-a-brac of a hippie crash-pad.\r\nHe is unmarried, mildly unkempt, and survives mostly\r\non TV dinners and turkey-stuffing eaten straight out\r\nof the bag.  Goldstein is a man of considerable charm\r\nand fluency, with a brief, disarming smile and the kind\r\nof pitiless, stubborn, thoroughly recidivist integrity\r\nthat America's electronic police find genuinely alarming.\r\n\r\nGoldstein took his nom-de-plume, or \"handle,\" from\r\na character in Orwell's 1984, which may be taken,\r\ncorrectly, as a symptom of the gravity of his sociopolitical\r\nworldview.  He is not himself a practicing computer\r\nintruder, though he vigorously abets these actions,\r\nespecially when they are pursued against large\r\ncorporations or governmental agencies.  Nor is he a thief,\r\nfor he loudly scorns mere theft of phone service, in favor\r\nof \"exploring and manipulating the system.\"  He is probably\r\nbest described and understood as a DISSIDENT.\r\n\r\nWeirdly, Goldstein is living in modern America\r\nunder conditions very similar to those of former\r\nEast European intellectual dissidents.  In other words,\r\nhe flagrantly espouses a value-system that is deeply\r\nand irrevocably opposed to the system of those in power\r\nand the police.  The values in 2600 are generally expressed\r\nin terms that are ironic, sarcastic, paradoxical, or just\r\ndownright confused.  But there's no mistaking their\r\nradically anti-authoritarian tenor.  2600 holds that\r\ntechnical power and specialized knowledge, of any kind\r\nobtainable, belong by right in the hands of those individuals\r\nbrave and bold enough to discover them--by whatever means necessary.\r\nDevices, laws, or systems that forbid access, and the free\r\nspread of knowledge, are provocations that any free\r\nand self-respecting hacker should relentlessly attack.\r\nThe \"privacy\" of governments, corporations and other soulless\r\ntechnocratic organizations should never be protected\r\nat the expense of the liberty and free initiative\r\nof the individual techno-rat.\r\n\r\nHowever, in our contemporary workaday world, both governments\r\nand corporations are very anxious indeed to police information\r\nwhich is secret, proprietary, restricted, confidential,\r\ncopyrighted, patented, hazardous, illegal, unethical,\r\nembarrassing, or otherwise sensitive.  This makes Goldstein\r\npersona non grata, and his philosophy a threat.\r\n\r\nVery little about the conditions of Goldstein's daily\r\nlife would astonish, say, Vaclav Havel.  (We may note\r\nin passing that President Havel once had his word-processor\r\nconfiscated by the Czechoslovak police.)  Goldstein lives\r\nby SAMIZDAT, acting semi-openly as a data-center\r\nfor the underground, while challenging the powers-that-be\r\nto abide by their own stated rules:  freedom of speech\r\nand the First Amendment.\r\n\r\nGoldstein thoroughly looks and acts the part of techno-rat,\r\nwith shoulder-length ringlets and a piratical black\r\nfisherman's-cap set at a rakish angle.  He often shows up\r\nlike Banquo's ghost at meetings of computer professionals,\r\nwhere he listens quietly, half-smiling and taking thorough notes.\r\n\r\nComputer professionals generally meet publicly,\r\nand find it very difficult to rid themselves of Goldstein\r\nand his ilk  without extralegal and unconstitutional actions.\r\nSympathizers, many of them quite respectable people\r\nwith responsible jobs, admire Goldstein's attitude and\r\nsurreptitiously pass him information.  An unknown but\r\npresumably large proportion of Goldstein's  2,000-plus\r\nreadership are telco security personnel and police,\r\nwho are forced to subscribe to 2600  to stay abreast\r\nof new developments in hacking.  They thus find themselves\r\nPAYING THIS GUY'S RENT while grinding their teeth in anguish,\r\na situation that would have delighted Abbie Hoffman\r\n(one of Goldstein's few idols).\r\n\r\nGoldstein is probably the best-known public representative\r\nof the hacker underground today, and certainly the best-hated.\r\nPolice regard him as a Fagin, a corrupter of youth, and speak\r\nof him with untempered loathing.  He is quite an accomplished gadfly.\r\nAfter the Martin Luther King Day Crash of 1990, Goldstein,\r\nfor instance, adeptly rubbed salt into the wound in the pages of 2600.\r\n\"Yeah, it was fun for the phone phreaks as we watched the network crumble,\"\r\nhe admitted cheerfully.  \"But it was also an ominous sign of what's\r\nto come. . . .  Some AT&T people, aided by well-meaning but ignorant media,\r\nwere spreading the notion that many companies had the same software\r\nand therefore could face the same problem someday.  Wrong.  This was\r\nentirely an AT&T software deficiency.  Of course, other companies could\r\nface entirely DIFFERENT software problems.  But then, so too could AT&T.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a technical discussion of the system's failings,\r\nthe Long Island techno-rat went on to offer thoughtful\r\ncriticism to the gigantic multinational's hundreds of\r\nprofessionally qualified engineers.  \"What we don't know\r\nis how a major force in communications like AT&T could\r\nbe so sloppy.  What happened to backups?  Sure,\r\ncomputer systems go down all the time, but people\r\nmaking phone calls are not the same as people logging\r\non to computers.  We must make that distinction.  It's not\r\nacceptable for the phone system or any other essential\r\nservice to `go down.'  If we continue to trust technology\r\nwithout understanding it, we can look forward to many\r\nvariations on this theme.\r\n\r\n\"AT&T owes it to its customers to be prepared to INSTANTLY\r\nswitch to another network if something strange and unpredictable\r\nstarts occurring.  The news here isn't so much the failure\r\nof a computer program, but the failure of AT&T's entire structure.\"\r\n\r\nThe very idea of this. . . . this PERSON. . . .  offering\r\n\"advice\" about \"AT&T's entire structure\" is more than\r\nsome people can easily bear.  How dare this near-criminal\r\ndictate what is or isn't \"acceptable\" behavior from AT&T?\r\nEspecially when he's publishing, in the very same issue,\r\ndetailed schematic diagrams for creating various switching-network\r\nsignalling tones unavailable to the public.\r\n\r\n\"See what happens when you drop a `silver box' tone or two\r\ndown your local exchange or through different long distance\r\nservice carriers,\" advises 2600 contributor \"Mr. Upsetter\"\r\nin \"How To Build a Signal Box.\"  \"If you experiment systematically\r\nand keep good records, you will surely discover something interesting.\"\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, the scientific method, generally regarded\r\nas a praiseworthy activity and one of the flowers of modern civilization.\r\nOne can indeed learn a great deal with this sort of structured\r\nintellectual activity.  Telco employees regard this mode of \"exploration\"\r\nas akin to flinging sticks of dynamite into their pond to see what lives\r\non the bottom.\r\n\r\n2600 has been published consistently since 1984.\r\nIt has also run a bulletin board computer system,\r\nprinted 2600 T-shirts, taken fax calls. . . .\r\nThe Spring 1991 issue has an interesting announcement on page 45:\r\n\"We just discovered an extra set of wires attached to our fax line\r\nand heading up the pole.  (They've since been clipped.)\r\nYour faxes to us and to anyone else could be monitored.\"\r\nIn the worldview of 2600, the tiny band of techno-rat brothers\r\n(rarely, sisters) are a beseiged vanguard of the truly free and honest.\r\nThe rest of the world is a maelstrom of corporate crime and high-level\r\ngovernmental corruption, occasionally tempered with well-meaning\r\nignorance.  To read a few issues in a row is to enter a nightmare\r\nakin to Solzhenitsyn's, somewhat tempered by the fact that 2600\r\nis often extremely funny.\r\n\r\nGoldstein did not become a target of the Hacker Crackdown,\r\nthough he protested loudly, eloquently, and publicly about it,\r\nand it added considerably to his fame.  It was not that he is not\r\nregarded as dangerous, because he is so regarded.  Goldstein has had\r\nbrushes with the law in the past:  in 1985, a 2600 bulletin board\r\ncomputer was seized by the FBI, and some software on it was formally\r\ndeclared \"a burglary tool in the form of a computer program.\"\r\nBut Goldstein escaped direct repression in 1990, because his\r\nmagazine is printed on paper, and recognized as subject\r\nto Constitutional freedom of the press protection.\r\nAs was seen in the Ramparts case, this is far from\r\nan absolute guarantee.  Still, as a practical matter,\r\nshutting down 2600 by court-order would create so much\r\nlegal hassle that it is simply unfeasible, at least\r\nfor the present.  Throughout 1990, both Goldstein\r\nand his magazine were peevishly thriving.\r\n\r\nInstead, the Crackdown of 1990 would concern itself\r\nwith the computerized version of forbidden data.\r\nThe crackdown itself, first and foremost, was about\r\nBULLETIN BOARD SYSTEMS.  Bulletin Board Systems, most often\r\nknown by the ugly and un-pluralizable acronym \"BBS,\" are\r\nthe life-blood of the digital underground.  Boards were\r\nalso central to law enforcement's tactics and strategy\r\nin the Hacker Crackdown.\r\n\r\nA \"bulletin board system\" can be formally defined as\r\na computer which serves as an information and message-\r\npassing center for users dialing-up over the phone-lines\r\nthrough the use of  modems.  A \"modem,\" or modulator-\r\ndemodulator, is a device which translates the digital\r\nimpulses of computers into audible analog telephone\r\nsignals, and vice versa.  Modems connect computers\r\nto phones and thus to each other.\r\n\r\nLarge-scale mainframe computers have been connected since the 1960s,\r\nbut PERSONAL computers, run by individuals out of their homes,\r\nwere first networked in the late 1970s.  The \"board\" created\r\nby Ward Christensen and Randy Suess in February 1978,\r\nin Chicago, Illinois, is generally regarded as the first\r\npersonal-computer bulletin board system worthy of the name.\r\n\r\nBoards run on many different machines, employing many\r\ndifferent kinds of software.  Early boards were crude and buggy,\r\nand their managers, known as \"system operators\" or \"sysops,\"\r\nwere hard-working technical experts who wrote their own software.\r\nBut like most everything else in the world of electronics,\r\nboards became faster, cheaper, better-designed, and generally\r\nfar more sophisticated throughout the 1980s.  They also moved\r\nswiftly out of the hands of pioneers and into those of the\r\ngeneral public.  By 1985 there were something in the\r\nneighborhood of 4,000 boards in America.  By 1990 it was\r\ncalculated, vaguely, that there were about 30,000 boards in\r\nthe US, with uncounted thousands overseas.\r\n\r\nComputer bulletin boards are unregulated enterprises.\r\nRunning a board is a rough-and-ready, catch-as-catch-can proposition.\r\nBasically, anybody with a computer, modem, software and a phone-line\r\ncan start a board.  With second-hand equipment and public-domain\r\nfree software, the price of a board might be quite small--\r\nless than it would take to publish a magazine or even a\r\ndecent pamphlet.  Entrepreneurs eagerly sell bulletin-board\r\nsoftware, and will coach nontechnical amateur sysops in its use.\r\n\r\nBoards are not \"presses.\"  They are not magazines,\r\nor libraries, or phones, or CB radios, or traditional cork\r\nbulletin boards down at the local laundry, though they\r\nhave some passing resemblance to those earlier media.\r\nBoards are a new medium--they may even be a LARGE NUMBER of new media.\r\n\r\nConsider these unique characteristics:  boards are cheap,\r\nyet they  can have a national, even global reach.\r\nBoards can be contacted from anywhere in the global\r\ntelephone network, at NO COST to the person running the board--\r\nthe caller pays the phone bill, and if the caller is local,\r\nthe call is free.  Boards do not involve an editorial elite\r\naddressing a mass audience.  The \"sysop\" of a board is not\r\nan exclusive publisher or writer--he is managing an electronic salon,\r\nwhere individuals can address the general public, play the part\r\nof the general public, and also  exchange private mail\r\nwith other individuals.  And the \"conversation\" on boards,\r\nthough fluid, rapid, and highly interactive, is not spoken,\r\nbut written.  It is also relatively anonymous, sometimes completely so.\r\n\r\nAnd because boards are cheap and ubiquitous, regulations\r\nand licensing requirements would likely be practically unenforceable.\r\nIt would almost be easier to \"regulate,\" \"inspect,\" and \"license\"\r\nthe content of private mail--probably more so, since the mail system\r\nis operated by the federal government.  Boards are run by individuals,\r\nindependently, entirely at their own whim.\r\n\r\nFor the sysop, the cost of operation is not the primary\r\nlimiting factor.  Once the investment in a computer and\r\nmodem has been made, the only steady cost is the charge\r\nfor maintaining a phone line (or several phone lines).\r\nThe primary limits for sysops are time and energy.\r\nBoards require upkeep.  New users are generally \"validated\"--\r\nthey must be issued individual passwords, and called at\r\nhome by voice-phone, so that their identity can be\r\nverified.  Obnoxious users, who exist in plenty, must be\r\nchided or purged.  Proliferating messages must be deleted\r\nwhen they grow old, so that the capacity of the system\r\nis not overwhelmed.  And software programs (if such things\r\nare kept on the board)  must be examined for possible\r\ncomputer viruses.  If there is a financial charge to use\r\nthe board (increasingly common, especially in larger and\r\nfancier systems) then accounts must be kept, and users\r\nmust be billed.  And if the board crashes--a very common\r\noccurrence--then repairs must be made.\r\n\r\nBoards can be distinguished by the amount of effort\r\nspent in regulating them.  First, we have the completely\r\nopen board, whose sysop is off chugging brews and\r\nwatching re-runs while his users generally degenerate\r\nover time into peevish anarchy and eventual silence.\r\nSecond comes the supervised board, where the sysop\r\nbreaks in every once in a while to tidy up, calm brawls,\r\nissue announcements, and rid the community of  dolts\r\nand troublemakers.  Third is the heavily supervised\r\nboard, which sternly urges adult and responsible behavior\r\nand swiftly edits any message considered offensive,\r\nimpertinent, illegal or irrelevant.  And last comes\r\nthe completely  edited \"electronic publication,\" which\r\nis presented to a silent audience which is not allowed\r\nto respond directly in any way.\r\n\r\nBoards can also be grouped by their degree of anonymity.\r\nThere is the completely anonymous board, where everyone\r\nuses pseudonyms--\"handles\"--and even the sysop is unaware\r\nof the user's true identity.  The sysop himself is likely\r\npseudonymous on a board of this type.  Second, and rather\r\nmore common, is the board where the sysop knows (or thinks\r\nhe knows) the true names and addresses of all users,\r\nbut the users don't know one another's names and may not know his.\r\nThird is the board where everyone has to use real names,\r\nand roleplaying and pseudonymous posturing are forbidden.\r\n\r\nBoards can be grouped by their immediacy.  \"Chat-lines\"\r\nare boards linking several users together over several\r\ndifferent phone-lines simultaneously, so that people\r\nexchange messages at the very moment that they type.\r\n(Many large boards feature \"chat\" capabilities along\r\nwith other services.)  Less immediate boards,\r\nperhaps with a single phoneline, store messages serially,\r\none at a time.  And some boards are only open for business\r\nin daylight hours or on weekends, which greatly slows response.\r\nA NETWORK of boards, such as \"FidoNet,\" can carry electronic mail\r\nfrom board to board, continent to continent, across huge distances--\r\nbut at a relative snail's pace, so that a message can take several\r\ndays to reach its target audience and elicit a reply.\r\n\r\nBoards can be grouped by their degree of community.\r\nSome boards emphasize the exchange of private,\r\nperson-to-person electronic mail.  Others emphasize\r\npublic postings and may even purge people who \"lurk,\"\r\nmerely reading posts but refusing to openly participate.\r\nSome boards are intimate and neighborly.  Others are frosty\r\nand highly technical.  Some are little more than storage\r\ndumps for software, where users \"download\" and \"upload\" programs,\r\nbut interact among themselves little if at all.\r\n\r\nBoards can be grouped by their ease of access.  Some boards\r\nare entirely public.  Others are private and restricted only\r\nto personal friends of the sysop.  Some boards divide users by status.\r\nOn these boards, some users, especially beginners, strangers or children,\r\nwill be restricted to general topics, and perhaps forbidden to post.\r\nFavored users, though, are granted the ability to post as they please,\r\nand to stay \"on-line\" as long as they like, even to the disadvantage\r\nof other people trying to call in.  High-status users can be given access\r\nto hidden areas in the board, such as off-color topics, private discussions,\r\nand/or valuable software.  Favored users may even become \"remote sysops\"\r\nwith the power to take remote control of the board through their own\r\nhome computers.  Quite often \"remote sysops\" end up doing all the work\r\nand taking formal control of the enterprise, despite the fact that it's\r\nphysically located in someone else's house.  Sometimes several \"co-sysops\"\r\nshare power.\r\n\r\nAnd boards can also be grouped by size.  Massive, nationwide\r\ncommercial networks, such as CompuServe, Delphi, GEnie and Prodigy,\r\nare run on mainframe computers and are generally not considered \"boards,\"\r\nthough they share many of their characteristics, such as electronic mail,\r\ndiscussion topics, libraries of software, and persistent and growing problems\r\nwith civil-liberties issues.  Some private boards have as many as\r\nthirty phone-lines and quite sophisticated hardware.  And then\r\nthere are tiny boards.\r\n\r\nBoards vary in popularity.  Some boards are huge and crowded,\r\nwhere users must claw their way in against a constant busy-signal.\r\nOthers are huge and empty--there are few things sadder than a formerly\r\nflourishing board where no one posts any longer, and the dead conversations\r\nof vanished users lie about gathering digital dust.  Some boards are tiny\r\nand intimate, their telephone numbers intentionally kept confidential\r\nso that only a small number can log on.\r\n\r\nAnd some boards are UNDERGROUND.\r\n\r\nBoards can be mysterious entities.  The activities of\r\ntheir users can be hard to differentiate from conspiracy.\r\nSometimes they ARE conspiracies.  Boards have harbored,\r\nor have been accused of harboring, all manner of fringe groups,\r\nand have abetted, or been accused of abetting, every manner\r\nof frowned-upon, sleazy, radical, and criminal activity.\r\nThere are Satanist boards.  Nazi boards.  Pornographic boards.\r\nPedophile boards.  Drug- dealing boards.  Anarchist boards.\r\nCommunist boards. Gay and Lesbian boards (these exist in great profusion,\r\nmany of them quite lively with well-established histories).\r\nReligious cult boards.  Evangelical boards.  Witchcraft\r\nboards, hippie boards, punk boards, skateboarder boards.\r\nBoards for UFO believers.  There may well be boards for\r\nserial killers, airline terrorists and professional assassins.\r\nThere is simply no way to tell.  Boards spring up, flourish,\r\nand disappear in large numbers, in most every corner of\r\nthe developed world.  Even apparently innocuous public\r\nboards can, and sometimes do, harbor secret areas known\r\nonly to a few.  And even on the vast, public, commercial services,\r\nprivate mail is very private--and quite possibly criminal.\r\n\r\nBoards cover most every topic imaginable and some\r\nthat are hard to imagine.  They cover a vast spectrum\r\nof social activity.  However, all board users do have\r\nsomething in common:  their possession of computers\r\nand phones.  Naturally, computers and phones are\r\nprimary topics of conversation on almost every board.\r\n\r\nAnd hackers and phone phreaks, those utter devotees\r\nof computers and phones, live by boards.  They swarm by boards.\r\nThey are bred by boards.  By the late 1980s, phone-phreak groups\r\nand hacker groups, united by boards, had proliferated fantastically.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs evidence, here is a list of hacker groups compiled\r\nby the editors of Phrack on August 8, 1988.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Administration.\r\nAdvanced Telecommunications, Inc.\r\nALIAS.\r\nAmerican Tone Travelers.\r\nAnarchy Inc.\r\nApple Mafia.\r\nThe Association.\r\nAtlantic Pirates Guild.\r\n\r\nBad Ass Mother Fuckers.\r\nBellcore.\r\nBell Shock Force.\r\nBlack Bag.\r\n\r\nCamorra.\r\nC&M Productions.\r\nCatholics Anonymous.\r\nChaos Computer Club.\r\nChief Executive Officers.\r\nCircle Of Death.\r\nCircle Of Deneb.\r\nClub X.\r\nCoalition of Hi-Tech\r\nPirates.\r\nCoast-To-Coast.\r\nCorrupt Computing.\r\nCult Of The\r\nDead Cow.\r\nCustom Retaliations.\r\n\r\nDamage Inc.\r\nD&B Communications.\r\nThe Danger Gang.\r\nDec Hunters.\r\nDigital Gang.\r\nDPAK.\r\n\r\nEastern Alliance.\r\nThe Elite Hackers Guild.\r\nElite Phreakers and Hackers Club.\r\nThe Elite Society Of America.\r\nEPG.\r\nExecutives Of Crime.\r\nExtasyy Elite.\r\n\r\nFargo 4A.\r\nFarmers Of Doom.\r\nThe Federation.\r\nFeds R Us.\r\nFirst Class.\r\nFive O.\r\nFive Star.\r\nForce Hackers.\r\nThe 414s.\r\n\r\nHack-A-Trip.\r\nHackers Of America.\r\nHigh Mountain Hackers.\r\nHigh Society.\r\nThe Hitchhikers.\r\n\r\nIBM Syndicate.\r\nThe Ice Pirates.\r\nImperial Warlords.\r\nInner Circle.\r\nInner Circle II.\r\nInsanity Inc.\r\nInternational Computer Underground Bandits.\r\n\r\nJustice League of America.\r\n\r\nKaos Inc.\r\nKnights Of Shadow.\r\nKnights Of The Round Table.\r\n\r\nLeague Of Adepts.\r\nLegion Of Doom.\r\nLegion Of Hackers.\r\nLords Of Chaos.\r\nLunatic Labs, Unlimited.\r\n\r\nMaster Hackers.\r\nMAD!\r\nThe Marauders.\r\nMD/PhD.\r\n\r\nMetal Communications, Inc.\r\nMetalliBashers, Inc.\r\nMBI.\r\n\r\nMetro Communications.\r\nMidwest Pirates Guild.\r\n\r\nNASA Elite.\r\nThe NATO Association.\r\nNeon Knights.\r\n\r\nNihilist Order.\r\nOrder Of The Rose.\r\nOSS.\r\n\r\nPacific Pirates Guild.\r\nPhantom Access Associates.\r\n\r\nPHido PHreaks.\r\nThe Phirm.\r\nPhlash.\r\nPhoneLine Phantoms.\r\nPhone Phreakers Of America.\r\nPhortune 500.\r\n\r\nPhreak Hack Delinquents.\r\nPhreak Hack Destroyers.\r\n\r\nPhreakers, Hackers, And Laundromat Employees Gang (PHALSE Gang).\r\nPhreaks Against Geeks.\r\nPhreaks Against Phreaks Against Geeks.\r\nPhreaks and Hackers of America.\r\nPhreaks Anonymous World Wide.\r\nProject Genesis.\r\nThe Punk Mafia.\r\n\r\nThe Racketeers.\r\nRed Dawn Text Files.\r\nRoscoe Gang.\r\n\r\n\r\nSABRE.\r\nSecret Circle of Pirates.\r\nSecret Service.\r\n707 Club.\r\nShadow Brotherhood.\r\nSharp Inc.\r\n65C02 Elite.\r\n\r\nSpectral Force.\r\nStar League.\r\nStowaways.\r\nStrata-Crackers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam Hackers '86.\r\nTeam Hackers '87.\r\n\r\nTeleComputist Newsletter Staff.\r\nTribunal Of Knowledge.\r\n\r\nTriple Entente.\r\nTurn Over And Die Syndrome (TOADS).\r\n\r\n300 Club.\r\n1200 Club.\r\n2300 Club.\r\n2600 Club.\r\n2601 Club.\r\n\r\n2AF.\r\n\r\nThe United Soft WareZ Force.\r\nUnited Technical Underground.\r\n\r\nWare Brigade.\r\nThe Warelords.\r\nWASP.\r\n\r\nContemplating this list is  an impressive, almost humbling business.\r\nAs a cultural artifact, the thing approaches poetry.\r\n\r\nUnderground groups--subcultures--can be distinguished\r\nfrom independent cultures by their  habit of referring\r\nconstantly to the parent society.  Undergrounds by their\r\nnature constantly  must maintain a membrane of differentiation.\r\nFunny/distinctive clothes and hair, specialized jargon, specialized\r\nghettoized areas in cities, different hours of rising, working,\r\nsleeping. . . .  The digital underground, which specializes in information,\r\nrelies very heavily on language to distinguish itself.  As can be seen\r\nfrom this list, they make heavy use of parody and mockery.\r\nIt's revealing to see who they choose to mock.\r\n\r\nFirst, large corporations.  We have the Phortune 500,\r\nThe Chief Executive Officers, Bellcore, IBM Syndicate,\r\nSABRE (a computerized reservation service maintained\r\nby airlines).  The common use of \"Inc.\" is telling--\r\nnone of these groups are actual corporations,\r\nbut take clear delight in mimicking them.\r\n\r\nSecond, governments and police.  NASA Elite, NATO Association.\r\n\"Feds R Us\" and \"Secret Service\" are fine bits of fleering boldness.\r\nOSS--the Office of Strategic Services was the forerunner of the CIA.\r\n\r\nThird, criminals.  Using stigmatizing pejoratives as a perverse\r\nbadge of honor is a time-honored tactic for subcultures:\r\npunks, gangs, delinquents, mafias, pirates, bandits, racketeers.\r\n\r\nSpecialized orthography, especially the use of \"ph\" for \"f\"\r\nand \"z\" for the plural \"s,\" are instant recognition symbols.\r\nSo is the use of the numeral \"0\" for the letter \"O\"\r\n--computer-software orthography generally features a\r\nslash through the zero, making the distinction obvious.\r\n\r\nSome terms are poetically descriptive of computer intrusion:\r\nthe Stowaways, the Hitchhikers, the PhoneLine Phantoms, Coast-to-Coast.\r\nOthers are simple bravado and vainglorious puffery.\r\n(Note the insistent use of the terms \"elite\" and \"master.\")\r\nSome terms are blasphemous, some obscene, others merely cryptic--\r\nanything to puzzle, offend, confuse, and keep the straights at bay.\r\n\r\nMany hacker groups further re-encrypt their names\r\nby the use of acronyms:  United Technical Underground\r\nbecomes UTU, Farmers of Doom become FoD, the United SoftWareZ\r\nForce becomes, at its own insistence, \"TuSwF,\" and woe to the\r\nignorant rodent who capitalizes the wrong letters.\r\n\r\nIt should be further recognized that the members of these groups\r\nare themselves pseudonymous.  If you did, in fact, run across\r\nthe \"PhoneLine Phantoms,\" you would find them to consist of\r\n\"Carrier Culprit,\" \"The Executioner,\" \"Black Majik,\"\r\n\"Egyptian Lover,\" \"Solid State,\" and  \"Mr Icom.\"\r\n\"Carrier Culprit\" will likely be referred to by his friends\r\nas \"CC,\" as in, \"I got these dialups from CC of PLP.\"\r\n\r\nIt's quite possible that this entire list refers to as\r\nfew as a thousand people.  It is not a complete list\r\nof underground groups--there has never been such a list,\r\nand there never will be.  Groups rise, flourish, decline,\r\nshare membership, maintain a cloud of wannabes and\r\ncasual hangers-on.  People pass in and out, are ostracized,\r\nget bored, are busted by police, or are cornered by telco\r\nsecurity and presented with huge bills.  Many \"underground\r\ngroups\" are software pirates, \"warez d00dz,\" who might break\r\ncopy protection and pirate programs, but likely wouldn't dare\r\nto intrude on a computer-system.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to estimate the true population of the digital\r\nunderground.  There is constant turnover.  Most hackers\r\nstart young, come and go, then drop out at age 22--\r\nthe age of college graduation.  And a large majority\r\nof \"hackers\" access pirate boards, adopt a handle,\r\nswipe software and perhaps abuse a phone-code or two,\r\nwhile never actually joining the elite.\r\n\r\nSome professional informants, who make it their business\r\nto retail knowledge of the underground to paymasters in private\r\ncorporate security, have estimated the hacker population\r\nat as high as fifty thousand.  This is likely highly inflated,\r\nunless one counts every single teenage software pirate\r\nand petty phone-booth thief.  My best guess is about 5,000 people.\r\nOf these, I would guess that as few as a hundred are truly \"elite\"\r\n--active computer intruders, skilled enough to penetrate\r\nsophisticated systems and truly to worry corporate security\r\nand law enforcement.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting speculation is whether this group\r\nis growing or not.  Young teenage hackers are often\r\nconvinced that hackers exist in vast swarms and will soon\r\ndominate the cybernetic universe.  Older and wiser\r\nveterans, perhaps as wizened as 24 or 25 years old,\r\nare convinced that the glory days are long gone, that the cops\r\nhave the underground's number now, and that kids these days\r\nare dirt-stupid and just want to play Nintendo.\r\n\r\nMy own assessment is that computer intrusion, as a non-profit act\r\nof intellectual exploration and mastery, is in slow decline,\r\nat least in the United States; but that electronic fraud,\r\nespecially telecommunication crime, is growing by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nOne might find a useful parallel to the digital underground\r\nin the drug  underground.  There was a time, now much-obscured\r\nby historical revisionism, when Bohemians freely shared joints\r\nat concerts, and hip, small-scale marijuana dealers might\r\nturn people on just for the sake of enjoying a long stoned conversation\r\nabout the Doors and Allen Ginsberg.  Now drugs are increasingly verboten,\r\nexcept in a high-stakes, highly-criminal world of highly addictive drugs.\r\nOver years of disenchantment and police harassment, a vaguely ideological,\r\nfree-wheeling drug underground has relinquished the business of drug-dealing\r\nto a  far more savage criminal hard-core.  This is not a pleasant prospect\r\nto contemplate, but the analogy is fairly compelling.\r\n\r\nWhat does an underground board look like?  What distinguishes\r\nit from a standard board?  It isn't necessarily the conversation--\r\nhackers often talk about common board topics, such as hardware, software,\r\nsex, science fiction, current events, politics, movies, personal gossip.\r\nUnderground boards can best be distinguished by their files, or \"philes,\"\r\npre-composed texts which teach the techniques and ethos of the underground.\r\nThese are prized reservoirs of forbidden knowledge.  Some are anonymous,\r\nbut most proudly bear the handle of the \"hacker\" who has created them,\r\nand his group affiliation, if he has one.\r\n\r\nHere is a partial table-of-contents of philes from an underground board,\r\nsomewhere in the heart of middle America, circa 1991.  The descriptions\r\nare mostly self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANKAMER.ZIP    5406 06-11-91  Hacking Bank America\r\nCHHACK.ZIP      4481 06-11-91  Chilton Hacking\r\nCITIBANK.ZIP    4118 06-11-91  Hacking Citibank\r\nCREDIMTC.ZIP    3241 06-11-91  Hacking Mtc Credit Company\r\nDIGEST.ZIP      5159 06-11-91  Hackers Digest\r\nHACK.ZIP       14031 06-11-91  How To Hack\r\nHACKBAS.ZIP     5073 06-11-91  Basics Of Hacking\r\nHACKDICT.ZIP   42774 06-11-91  Hackers Dictionary\r\nHACKER.ZIP     57938 06-11-91  Hacker Info\r\nHACKERME.ZIP    3148 06-11-91  Hackers Manual\r\nHACKHAND.ZIP    4814 06-11-91  Hackers Handbook\r\nHACKTHES.ZIP   48290 06-11-91  Hackers Thesis\r\nHACKVMS.ZIP     4696 06-11-91  Hacking Vms Systems\r\nMCDON.ZIP       3830 06-11-91  Hacking Macdonalds (Home Of The Archs)\r\nP500UNIX.ZIP   15525 06-11-91  Phortune 500 Guide To Unix\r\nRADHACK.ZIP     8411 06-11-91  Radio Hacking\r\nTAOTRASH.DOC    4096 12-25-89  Suggestions For Trashing\r\nTECHHACK.ZIP    5063 06-11-91  Technical Hacking\r\n\r\n\r\nThe files above are do-it-yourself manuals about computer intrusion.\r\nThe above is only a small section of a much larger library of hacking\r\nand phreaking techniques and history.

The damned thing is full of stuff about bombs!\r\n\r\nWhat are we to make of this?\r\n\r\nFirst, it should be acknowledged that spreading\r\nknowledge about demolitions to teenagers is a highly and\r\ndeliberately antisocial act.  It is not, however, illegal.\r\n\r\nSecond, it should be recognized that most of these\r\nphiles were in fact WRITTEN by teenagers.  Most adult\r\nAmerican males who can remember their teenage years\r\nwill recognize that the notion of building a flamethrower\r\nin your garage is an incredibly neat-o idea.  ACTUALLY,\r\nbuilding a flamethrower in your garage, however, is\r\nfraught with discouraging difficulty.  Stuffing gunpowder\r\ninto a booby-trapped flashlight, so as to blow the arm off\r\nyour high-school vice-principal, can be a thing of dark\r\nbeauty to contemplate.  Actually committing assault by\r\nexplosives  will earn you the sustained attention of the\r\nfederal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\r\n\r\nSome people, however, will actually try these plans.\r\nA determinedly murderous American teenager can probably\r\nbuy or steal a handgun far more easily than he can brew\r\nfake \"napalm\" in the kitchen sink.  Nevertheless,\r\nif temptation is spread before people, a certain number\r\nwill succumb, and a small minority will actually attempt\r\nthese stunts.  A large minority of that small minority\r\nwill either fail or, quite likely, maim themselves,\r\nsince these \"philes\" have not been checked for accuracy,\r\nare not the product of professional experience,\r\nand are often highly fanciful.  But the gloating menace\r\nof these philes is not to be entirely dismissed.\r\n\r\nHackers may not be \"serious\" about bombing; if they were,\r\nwe would hear far more about exploding flashlights, homemade bazookas,\r\nand gym teachers poisoned by chlorine and potassium.\r\nHowever, hackers are VERY serious about forbidden knowledge.\r\nThey are possessed not merely by curiosity, but by\r\na positive LUST TO KNOW. The desire to know what\r\nothers don't is scarcely new.  But the INTENSITY\r\nof this desire, as manifested by these young technophilic\r\ndenizens of the Information Age, may in fact BE new,\r\nand may represent some basic shift in social values--\r\na harbinger of what the world may come to, as society\r\nlays more and more value on the possession,\r\nassimilation and retailing of INFORMATION\r\nas a basic commodity of daily life.\r\n\r\nThere have always been young men with obsessive interests\r\nin these topics.  Never before, however, have they been able\r\nto network so extensively and easily, and to propagandize\r\ntheir interests with impunity to random passers-by.\r\nHigh-school teachers will recognize that there's always\r\none in a crowd, but when the one in a crowd escapes control\r\nby jumping into the phone-lines, and becomes a hundred such kids\r\nall together on a board, then trouble is brewing visibly.\r\nThe urge of authority to DO SOMETHING, even something drastic,\r\nis hard to resist. And in 1990, authority did something.\r\nIn fact authority did a great deal.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe process by which boards create hackers goes something\r\nlike this.  A youngster becomes interested in computers--\r\nusually, computer games.  He hears from friends that\r\n\"bulletin boards\" exist where games can be obtained for free.\r\n(Many computer games are \"freeware,\" not copyrighted--\r\ninvented simply for the love of it and given away to the public;\r\nsome of these games are quite good.)  He bugs his parents for a modem,\r\nor quite often, uses his parents' modem.\r\n\r\nThe world of boards suddenly opens up.  Computer games\r\ncan be quite expensive, real budget-breakers for a kid,\r\nbut pirated games, stripped of copy protection, are cheap or free.\r\nThey are also illegal, but it is very rare, almost unheard of,\r\nfor a small-scale software pirate to be prosecuted.\r\nOnce \"cracked\" of its copy protection, the program,\r\nbeing digital data, becomes infinitely reproducible.\r\nEven the instructions to the game, any manuals that accompany it,\r\ncan be reproduced as text files, or photocopied from legitimate sets.\r\nOther users on boards can give many useful hints in game-playing tactics.\r\nAnd a youngster with an infinite supply of free computer games can\r\ncertainly cut quite a swath among his modem-less friends.\r\n\r\nAnd boards are pseudonymous.  No one need know that you're\r\nfourteen years old--with a little practice at subterfuge,\r\nyou can talk to adults about adult things, and be accepted\r\nand taken seriously!  You can even pretend to be a girl,\r\nor an old man, or anybody you can imagine.  If you find this\r\nkind of deception gratifying, there is ample opportunity\r\nto hone your ability on boards.\r\n\r\nBut local boards can grow stale.  And almost every board maintains\r\na list of phone-numbers to other boards, some in distant, tempting,\r\nexotic locales.  Who knows what they're up to, in Oregon or Alaska\r\nor Florida or California?  It's very easy to find out--just order\r\nthe modem to call through its software--nothing to this, just typing\r\non a keyboard, the same thing you would do for most any computer game.\r\nThe machine reacts swiftly and in a few seconds you are talking to\r\na bunch of interesting people on another seaboard.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the BILLS for this trivial action can be staggering!\r\nJust by going tippety-tap with your fingers, you may have\r\nsaddled your parents with four hundred bucks in long-distance charges,\r\nand gotten chewed out but good.  That hardly seems fair.\r\n\r\nHow horrifying to have made friends in another state\r\nand to be deprived of their company--and their software--\r\njust because telephone companies demand absurd amounts of money!\r\nHow painful, to be restricted to boards in one's own AREA CODE--\r\nwhat the heck is an \"area code\" anyway, and what makes it so special?\r\nA few grumbles, complaints, and innocent questions of this sort\r\nwill often elicit a sympathetic reply from another board user--\r\nsomeone with some stolen codes to hand.  You dither a while,\r\nknowing this isn't quite right, then you make up your mind\r\nto try them anyhow--AND THEY WORK!  Suddenly you're doing something\r\neven your parents can't do.  Six months ago you were just some kid--now,\r\nyou're the Crimson Flash of Area Code 512!  You're bad--you're nationwide!\r\n\r\nMaybe you'll stop at a few abused codes.  Maybe you'll decide that\r\nboards aren't all that interesting after all, that it's wrong,\r\nnot worth the risk --but maybe you won't.  The next step\r\nis to pick up your own repeat-dialling program--\r\nto learn to generate your own stolen codes.\r\n(This was dead easy five years ago, much harder\r\nto get away with nowadays, but not yet impossible.)\r\nAnd these dialling programs are not complex or intimidating--\r\nsome are as small as twenty lines of software.\r\n\r\nNow, you too can share codes.  You can trade codes to learn\r\nother techniques.  If you're smart enough to catch on,\r\nand obsessive enough to want to bother, and ruthless enough\r\nto start seriously bending rules, then you'll get better, fast.\r\nYou start to develop a rep.  You  move up to a heavier class\r\nof board--a board with a bad attitude, the kind of board\r\nthat naive dopes like your classmates and your former self\r\nhave never even heard of!  You pick up the jargon of phreaking\r\nand hacking from the board.  You read a few of those anarchy philes--\r\nand man, you never realized you could be a real OUTLAW without\r\never leaving your bedroom.\r\n\r\nYou still play other computer games, but now you have a new\r\nand bigger game.  This one will bring you a different kind of status\r\nthan destroying even eight zillion lousy space invaders.\r\n\r\nHacking is perceived by hackers as a \"game.\"  This is\r\nnot an entirely unreasonable or sociopathic perception.\r\nYou can win or lose at hacking, succeed or fail,\r\nbut it never feels \"real.\"  It's not simply that\r\nimaginative youngsters sometimes have a hard time\r\ntelling \"make-believe\" from \"real life.\"  Cyberspace\r\nis NOT REAL!  \"Real\" things are physical objects\r\nlike trees and shoes and cars.  Hacking takes place\r\non a screen.  Words aren't physical, numbers\r\n(even telephone numbers and credit card numbers)\r\naren't physical.  Sticks and stones may break my bones,\r\nbut data will never hurt me.  Computers SIMULATE reality,\r\nlike computer games that simulate tank battles or dogfights\r\nor spaceships.  Simulations are just make-believe,\r\nand the stuff in computers is NOT REAL.\r\n\r\nConsider this:  if \"hacking\" is supposed to be so serious and\r\nreal-life and dangerous, then how come NINE-YEAR-OLD KIDS have\r\ncomputers and modems?  You wouldn't give a nine year old his own car,\r\nor his own rifle, or his own chainsaw--those things are \"real.\"\r\n\r\nPeople underground are perfectly aware that the \"game\"\r\nis frowned upon by the powers that be.  Word gets around\r\nabout busts in the underground.  Publicizing busts is one\r\nof the primary functions of pirate boards, but they also\r\npromulgate an attitude about them, and their own idiosyncratic\r\nideas of justice.  The users of underground boards won't complain\r\nif some guy is busted for crashing systems, spreading viruses,\r\nor stealing money by wire-fraud.  They may shake their heads\r\nwith a sneaky grin, but they won't openly defend these practices.\r\nBut when a kid is charged with some theoretical amount of theft:\r\n$233,846.14, for instance, because he sneaked into a computer\r\nand copied something, and kept it in his house on a floppy disk--\r\nthis is regarded as a sign of near-insanity from prosecutors,\r\na sign that they've drastically mistaken the immaterial game\r\nof computing for their real and boring everyday world\r\nof fatcat corporate money.\r\n\r\nIt's as if big companies and their suck-up lawyers\r\nthink that computing belongs to them, and they can\r\nretail it with price stickers, as if it were boxes\r\nof laundry soap!  But pricing \"information\" is like\r\ntrying to price air or price dreams.  Well, anybody\r\non a pirate board knows that computing can be,\r\nand ought to be, FREE.  Pirate boards are little\r\nindependent worlds in cyberspace, and they don't belong\r\nto anybody but the underground.  Underground boards\r\naren't \"brought to you by Procter & Gamble.\"\r\n\r\nTo log on to an underground board can mean to\r\nexperience liberation, to enter a world where,\r\nfor once, money isn't everything and adults\r\ndon't have all the answers.\r\n\r\nLet's sample another vivid hacker manifesto.  Here are\r\nsome excerpts from \"The Conscience of a Hacker,\" by \"The Mentor,\"\r\nfrom Phrack Volume One, Issue 7, Phile 3.\r\n\r\n\"I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.\r\nWait a second, this is cool.  It does what I want it to.\r\nIf it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up.\r\nNot because it doesn't like me. (. . .)\r\n\"And then it happened. . .a door opened to a world. . .\r\nrushing through the phone line like heroin through an\r\naddict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out,\r\na refuge from day-to-day incompetencies is sought. . .\r\na board is found.  `This is it. . .this is where I belong. . .'\r\n\"I know everyone here. . .even if I've never met them,\r\nnever talked to them, may never hear from them again. . .\r\nI know you all. . . (. . .)\r\n\r\n\"This is our world now. . .the world of the electron\r\nand the switch, the beauty of the baud.  We make use of a\r\nservice already existing without paying for what could be\r\ndirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you\r\ncall us criminals.  We explore. . .and you call us criminals.\r\nWe seek after knowledge. . .and you call us criminals.\r\nWe exist without skin color, without nationality,\r\nwithout religious bias. . .and you call us criminals.\r\nYou build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder,\r\ncheat and lie to us and try to make us believe that\r\nit's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.\r\nMy crime is that of judging people by what they say and think,\r\nnot what they look like.  My crime is that of outsmarting you,\r\nsomething that you will never forgive me for.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThere have been underground boards almost as long\r\nas there have been boards.  One of the first was 8BBS,\r\nwhich became a stronghold of the West Coast phone-phreak elite.\r\nAfter going on-line in March 1980, 8BBS sponsored \"Susan Thunder,\"\r\nand \"Tuc,\" and, most notoriously, \"the Condor.\"  \"The Condor\"\r\nbore the singular distinction of becoming the most vilified\r\nAmerican phreak and hacker ever.  Angry underground associates,\r\nfed up with Condor's peevish behavior, turned him in to police,\r\nalong with a heaping double-helping of outrageous hacker legendry.\r\nAs a result, Condor was kept in solitary confinement for seven months,\r\nfor fear that he might start World War Three by triggering missile silos\r\nfrom the prison payphone.  (Having served his time, Condor is now\r\nwalking around loose;  WWIII has thus far conspicuously failed to occur.)\r\n\r\nThe sysop of 8BBS was an ardent free-speech enthusiast\r\nwho simply felt that ANY attempt to restrict the expression\r\nof his users was unconstitutional and immoral.\r\nSwarms of the technically curious entered 8BBS\r\nand emerged as phreaks and hackers, until, in 1982,\r\na friendly 8BBS alumnus passed the sysop a new modem\r\nwhich had been purchased by credit-card fraud.\r\nPolice took this opportunity to seize the entire board\r\nand remove what they considered an attractive nuisance.\r\n\r\nPlovernet was a powerful East Coast pirate board\r\nthat operated in both New York and Florida.\r\nOwned and operated by teenage hacker \"Quasi Moto,\"\r\nPlovernet attracted five hundred eager users in 1983.\r\n\"Emmanuel Goldstein\" was one-time co-sysop of Plovernet,\r\nalong with \"Lex Luthor,\" founder of the \"Legion of Doom\" group.\r\nPlovernet  bore the signal honor of being the original home\r\nof the \"Legion of Doom,\" about which the reader will be hearing\r\na great deal, soon.\r\n\r\n\"Pirate-80,\" or \"P-80,\" run by a sysop known as \"Scan-Man,\"\r\ngot into the game very early in Charleston, and continued\r\nsteadily for years.  P-80 flourished so flagrantly that\r\neven its most hardened users became nervous, and some\r\nslanderously speculated that \"Scan Man\" must have ties\r\nto corporate security, a charge he vigorously denied.\r\n\r\n\"414 Private\" was the home board for the first GROUP\r\nto attract conspicuous trouble, the teenage \"414 Gang,\"\r\nwhose intrusions into Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and\r\nLos Alamos military computers were to be a nine-days-wonder in 1982.\r\n\r\nAt about this time, the first software piracy boards\r\nbegan to open up, trading cracked games for the Atari 800\r\nand the Commodore C64.  Naturally these boards were\r\nheavily frequented by teenagers.  And with the 1983\r\nrelease of the hacker-thriller movie War Games,\r\nthe scene exploded.  It seemed that every kid\r\nin America had demanded and gotten a modem for Christmas.\r\nMost of these dabbler wannabes put their modems in the attic\r\nafter a few weeks, and most of the remainder minded their\r\nP's and Q's and stayed well out of hot water.  But some\r\nstubborn and talented diehards had this hacker kid in\r\nWar Games figured for a happening dude.  They simply\r\ncould not rest until they had contacted the underground--\r\nor, failing that, created their own.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-80s, underground boards sprang up like digital fungi.\r\nShadowSpawn Elite.  Sherwood Forest I, II, and III.\r\nDigital Logic Data Service in Florida, sysoped by no less\r\na man than \"Digital Logic\" himself; Lex Luthor of the\r\nLegion of Doom was prominent on this board, since it\r\nwas in his area code.  Lex's own board, \"Legion of Doom,\"\r\nstarted in 1984.  The Neon Knights ran a network of Apple-\r\nhacker boards: Neon Knights North, South, East and West.\r\nFree World II was run by \"Major Havoc.\"  Lunatic Labs\r\nis still in operation as of this writing.  Dr. Ripco\r\nin Chicago, an anything-goes anarchist board with an\r\nextensive and raucous history, was seized by Secret Service\r\nagents in 1990 on Sundevil day, but up again almost immediately,\r\nwith new machines and scarcely diminished vigor.\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis scene was not to rank with major centers\r\nof American hacking such as New York and L.A.  But St.\r\nLouis did rejoice in possession of \"Knight Lightning\"\r\nand \"Taran King,\" two of the foremost JOURNALISTS native\r\nto the underground.  Missouri boards like Metal Shop,\r\nMetal Shop Private, Metal Shop Brewery, may not have\r\nbeen the heaviest boards around in terms of illicit\r\nexpertise.  But they became boards where hackers could\r\nexchange social gossip and try to figure out what the\r\nheck was going on nationally--and internationally.\r\nGossip from Metal Shop was put into the form of news files,\r\nthen assembled into a general electronic publication,\r\nPhrack, a portmanteau title coined from \"phreak\" and \"hack.\"\r\nThe Phrack editors were as obsessively curious about other\r\nhackers as hackers were about machines.\r\n\r\nPhrack, being free of charge and lively reading, began\r\nto circulate throughout the underground.  As Taran King\r\nand Knight Lightning left high school for college,\r\nPhrack began to appear on mainframe machines linked to BITNET,\r\nand, through BITNET to the \"Internet,\" that loose but\r\nextremely potent not-for-profit network where academic,\r\ngovernmental and corporate machines trade data through\r\nthe UNIX TCP/IP protocol.  (The \"Internet Worm\" of\r\nNovember 2-3,1988, created by Cornell grad student Robert Morris,\r\nwas to be the largest and best-publicized computer-intrusion scandal\r\nto date.  Morris claimed that his ingenious \"worm\" program was meant\r\nto harmlessly explore the Internet, but due to bad programming,\r\nthe Worm replicated out of control and crashed some six thousand\r\nInternet computers.  Smaller-scale and less ambitious Internet hacking\r\nwas a standard for the underground elite.)\r\n\r\nMost any underground board not hopelessly lame and out-of-it\r\nwould feature a complete run of Phrack--and, possibly,\r\nthe lesser-known standards of the underground:\r\nthe Legion of Doom Technical Journal, the obscene\r\nand raucous Cult of the Dead Cow  files, P/HUN magazine,\r\nPirate, the Syndicate Reports, and perhaps the highly\r\nanarcho-political Activist Times Incorporated.\r\n\r\nPossession of Phrack  on one's board was prima facie\r\nevidence of a bad attitude.  Phrack was seemingly everywhere,\r\naiding, abetting, and spreading the underground ethos.\r\nAnd this did not escape the attention of corporate security\r\nor the police.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the touchy subject of police and boards.\r\nPolice, do, in fact, own boards.  In 1989, there were\r\npolice-sponsored boards in California, Colorado, Florida,\r\nGeorgia, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Texas, and Virginia:\r\nboards such as \"Crime Bytes,\" \"Crimestoppers,\" \"All Points\"\r\nand \"Bullet-N-Board.\"  Police officers, as private computer\r\nenthusiasts, ran their own boards in Arizona, California,\r\nColorado, Connecticut, Florida, Missouri, Maryland,\r\nNew Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.\r\nPolice boards have often proved helpful in community relations.\r\nSometimes crimes are reported on police boards.\r\n\r\nSometimes crimes are COMMITTED on police boards.\r\nThis has sometimes happened by accident, as naive hackers\r\nblunder onto police boards and blithely begin offering telephone codes.\r\nFar more often, however, it occurs through the now almost-traditional\r\nuse of \"sting boards.\"  The first police sting-boards were established\r\nin 1985:  \"Underground Tunnel\" in Austin, Texas, whose sysop\r\nSgt. Robert Ansley called himself \"Pluto\"--\"The Phone Company\"\r\nin Phoenix, Arizona, run by Ken MacLeod of the Maricopa County\r\nSheriff's office--and Sgt. Dan Pasquale's board in Fremont, California.\r\nSysops posed as hackers, and swiftly garnered coteries of ardent users,\r\nwho posted codes and loaded pirate software with abandon,\r\nand came to a sticky end.\r\n\r\nSting boards, like other boards, are cheap to operate,\r\nvery cheap by the standards of undercover police operations.\r\nOnce accepted by the local underground, sysops will likely be\r\ninvited into other pirate boards, where they can compile more dossiers.\r\nAnd when the sting is announced and the worst offenders arrested,\r\nthe publicity is generally  gratifying.  The resultant paranoia\r\nin the underground--perhaps more justly described as a \"deterrence effect\"--\r\ntends to quell local lawbreaking for quite a while.\r\n\r\nObviously police do not have to beat the underbrush for hackers.\r\nOn the contrary, they can go trolling for them. Those caught\r\ncan be grilled.  Some become useful informants.  They can lead\r\nthe way to pirate boards all across the country.\r\n\r\nAnd boards all across the country showed the sticky\r\nfingerprints of Phrack, and of that loudest and most\r\nflagrant of all underground groups, the \"Legion of Doom.\"\r\n\r\nThe term \"Legion of Doom\" came from comic books.  The Legion of Doom,\r\na conspiracy of costumed super- villains headed by the chrome-domed\r\ncriminal ultra- mastermind Lex Luthor, gave Superman a lot of four-color\r\ngraphic trouble for a number of decades.  Of course, Superman,\r\nthat exemplar of Truth, Justice, and the American Way,\r\nalways won in the long run.  This didn't matter to the hacker Doomsters--\r\n\"Legion of Doom\" was not some thunderous and evil Satanic reference,\r\nit was not meant to be taken seriously.  \"Legion of Doom\" came\r\nfrom funny-books and was supposed to be funny.\r\n\r\n\"Legion of Doom\" did have a good mouthfilling ring to it, though.\r\nIt sounded really cool.  Other groups, such as the \"Farmers of Doom,\"\r\nclosely allied to LoD, recognized this grandiloquent quality,\r\nand made fun of it.  There was even a hacker group called\r\n\"Justice League of America,\" named after Superman's club\r\nof true-blue crimefighting superheros.\r\n\r\nBut they didn't last; the Legion did.\r\n\r\nThe original Legion of Doom, hanging out on Quasi Moto's Plovernet board,\r\nwere phone phreaks.  They weren't much into computers.  \"Lex Luthor\" himself\r\n(who was under eighteen when he formed the Legion) was a COSMOS expert,\r\nCOSMOS being the \"Central System for Mainframe Operations,\"\r\na telco internal computer network.  Lex would eventually become\r\nquite a dab hand at breaking into IBM mainframes, but although\r\neveryone liked Lex and admired his attitude, he was not considered\r\na truly accomplished computer intruder.  Nor was he the \"mastermind\"\r\nof the Legion of Doom--LoD were never big on formal leadership.\r\nAs a regular on Plovernet and sysop of his \"Legion of Doom BBS,\"\r\nLex was the Legion's cheerleader and recruiting officer.\r\n\r\nLegion of Doom began on the ruins of an earlier phreak group,\r\nThe Knights of Shadow.  Later, LoD was to subsume the personnel\r\nof the hacker group \"Tribunal of Knowledge.\"  People came and went\r\nconstantly in LoD; groups split up or formed offshoots.\r\n\r\nEarly on, the LoD phreaks befriended a few computer-intrusion\r\nenthusiasts, who became the associated \"Legion of Hackers.\"\r\nThen the two groups conflated into the \"Legion of Doom/Hackers,\"\r\nor LoD/H. When the original \"hacker\" wing, Messrs. \"Compu-Phreak\"\r\nand \"Phucked Agent 04,\" found other matters to occupy their time,\r\nthe extra \"/H\" slowly atrophied out of the name;  but by this time\r\nthe phreak wing, Messrs. Lex Luthor, \"Blue Archer,\" \"Gary Seven,\"\r\n\"Kerrang Khan,\" \"Master of Impact,\" \"Silver Spy,\" \"The Marauder,\"\r\nand \"The Videosmith,\" had picked up a plethora of intrusion\r\nexpertise and had become a force to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nLoD members seemed to have an instinctive understanding\r\nthat the way to real power in the underground lay through\r\ncovert publicity.  LoD were flagrant.  Not only was it one\r\nof the earliest groups, but the members took pains to widely\r\ndistribute their illicit knowledge.  Some LoD members,\r\nlike \"The Mentor,\" were close to evangelical about it.\r\nLegion of Doom Technical Journal began to show up on boards\r\nthroughout the underground.\r\n\r\nLoD Technical Journal was named in cruel parody\r\nof the ancient and honored AT&T Technical Journal.\r\nThe material in these two publications was quite similar--\r\nmuch of it, adopted from public journals and discussions\r\nin the telco community.  And yet, the predatory attitude\r\nof LoD made even its most innocuous data seem deeply sinister;\r\nan outrage; a clear and present danger.\r\n\r\nTo see why this should be, let's consider the following\r\n(invented) paragraphs, as a kind of thought experiment.\r\n\r\n(A)  \"W. Fred Brown, AT&T Vice President for\r\nAdvanced Technical Development, testified May 8\r\nat a Washington hearing of the National Telecommunications\r\nand Information Administration (NTIA), regarding\r\nBellcore's GARDEN project.  GARDEN (Generalized\r\nAutomatic Remote Distributed Electronic Network) is a\r\ntelephone-switch programming tool that makes it possible\r\nto develop new telecom services, including hold-on-hold\r\nand customized message transfers, from any keypad terminal,\r\nwithin seconds.  The GARDEN prototype combines centrex\r\nlines with a minicomputer using UNIX operating system software.\"\r\n\r\n(B)  \"Crimson Flash 512 of the Centrex Mobsters reports:\r\nD00dz, you wouldn't believe this GARDEN bullshit Bellcore's\r\njust come up with!  Now you don't even need a lousy Commodore\r\nto reprogram a switch--just log on to GARDEN as a technician,\r\nand you can reprogram switches right off the keypad in any\r\npublic phone booth!  You can give yourself hold-on-hold\r\nand customized message transfers, and best of all,\r\nthe thing is run off (notoriously insecure) centrex lines\r\nusing--get this--standard UNIX software!  Ha ha ha ha!\"\r\n\r\nMessage (A), couched in typical techno-bureaucratese,\r\nappears tedious and almost unreadable.  (A) scarcely seems\r\nthreatening or menacing.  Message (B), on the other hand,\r\nis a dreadful thing, prima facie evidence of a dire conspiracy,\r\ndefinitely not the kind of thing you want your teenager reading.\r\n\r\nThe INFORMATION, however, is identical.  It is PUBLIC\r\ninformation, presented before the federal government in\r\nan open hearing.  It is not \"secret.\"  It is not \"proprietary.\"\r\nIt is not even \"confidential.\"  On the contrary, the\r\ndevelopment of advanced software systems is a matter\r\nof great public pride to Bellcore.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Bellcore publicly announces a project of this kind,\r\nit expects a certain attitude from the public--something along\r\nthe lines of GOSH WOW, YOU GUYS ARE GREAT, KEEP THAT UP, WHATEVER IT IS--\r\ncertainly not cruel mimickry, one-upmanship and outrageous speculations\r\nabout possible security holes.\r\n\r\nNow put yourself in the place of a policeman confronted by\r\nan outraged parent, or telco official, with a copy of Version (B).\r\nThis well-meaning citizen, to his horror, has discovered\r\na local bulletin-board carrying outrageous stuff like (B),\r\nwhich his son is examining with a deep and unhealthy interest.\r\nIf (B) were printed in a book or magazine, you, as an American\r\nlaw enforcement officer, would know that it would take\r\na hell of a lot of trouble to do anything about it;\r\nbut it doesn't take technical genius to recognize that\r\nif there's a computer in your area harboring stuff like (B),\r\nthere's going to be trouble.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you ask around, any computer-literate cop\r\nwill tell you straight out that boards with stuff like (B)\r\nare the SOURCE of trouble.  And the WORST source of trouble\r\non boards are the ringleaders inventing and spreading stuff like (B).\r\nIf it weren't for these jokers, there wouldn't BE any trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd Legion of Doom were on boards like nobody else.\r\nPlovernet.  The Legion of Doom Board.  The Farmers of Doom Board.\r\nMetal Shop.  OSUNY.  Blottoland. Private Sector.  Atlantis.\r\nDigital Logic.  Hell Phrozen Over.\r\n\r\nLoD members also ran their own boards.  \"Silver Spy\" started\r\nhis own board, \"Catch-22,\" considered one of the heaviest around.\r\nSo did \"Mentor,\" with his \"Phoenix Project.\"  When they didn't run boards\r\nthemselves, they showed up on other people's boards, to brag, boast,\r\nand strut.  And where they themselves didn't go, their philes went,\r\ncarrying evil knowledge and an even more evil attitude.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1986, the police were under the vague impression\r\nthat EVERYONE in the underground was Legion of Doom.\r\nLoD was never that large--considerably smaller than either\r\n\"Metal Communications\" or \"The Administration,\" for instance--\r\nbut LoD got tremendous press.  Especially in Phrack,\r\nwhich at times read like an LoD fan magazine; and Phrack\r\nwas everywhere, especially in the offices of telco security.\r\nYou couldn't GET busted as a phone phreak, a hacker,\r\nor even a lousy codes kid or warez dood, without the cops\r\nasking if you were LoD.\r\n\r\nThis was a difficult charge to deny, as LoD never\r\ndistributed membership badges or laminated ID cards.\r\nIf they had, they would likely have died out quickly,\r\nfor turnover in their membership was considerable.\r\nLoD was less a high-tech street-gang than an ongoing\r\nstate-of-mind.  LoD was the Gang That Refused to Die.\r\nBy 1990, LoD had RULED for ten years, and it seemed WEIRD\r\nto police that they were continually busting people who were\r\nonly sixteen years old.  All these teenage small-timers\r\nwere pleading the tiresome hacker litany  of \"just curious,\r\nno criminal intent.\"  Somewhere at the center of this\r\nconspiracy there had to be some serious adult masterminds,\r\nnot this seemingly endless supply of myopic suburban\r\nwhite kids with high SATs and funny haircuts.\r\n\r\nThere was no question that most any American hacker\r\narrested would \"know\" LoD.  They knew the handles\r\nof contributors to LoD Tech Journal, and were likely\r\nto have learned their craft through LoD boards and LoD activism.\r\nBut they'd never met anyone from LoD.  Even some of the\r\nrotating cadre who were actually and formally \"in LoD\"\r\nknew one another only by board-mail and pseudonyms.\r\nThis was a highly unconventional profile for a criminal conspiracy.\r\nComputer networking, and the rapid evolution of the digital underground,\r\nmade the situation very diffuse and confusing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a big reputation in the digital underground\r\ndid not coincide with one's willingness to commit \"crimes.\"\r\nInstead, reputation was based on cleverness and technical mastery.\r\nAs a result, it often seemed that the HEAVIER the hackers were,\r\nthe LESS likely they were to have committed any kind of common,\r\neasily prosecutable crime.  There were some hackers who could really steal.\r\nAnd there were hackers who could really hack.  But the two groups didn't seem\r\nto overlap much, if at all.  For instance, most people in the underground\r\nlooked up to \"Emmanuel Goldstein\" of 2600 as a hacker demigod.\r\nBut Goldstein's publishing activities were entirely legal--\r\nGoldstein just printed dodgy stuff and talked about politics,\r\nhe didn't even hack.  When you came right down to it,\r\nGoldstein spent half his time complaining that computer security\r\nWASN'T STRONG ENOUGH and ought to be drastically improved\r\nacross the board!\r\n\r\nTruly heavy-duty hackers, those with serious technical skills\r\nwho had earned the respect of the underground, never stole money\r\nor abused credit cards.  Sometimes they might abuse phone-codes--\r\nbut often, they seemed to get all the free phone-time they wanted\r\nwithout leaving a trace of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe best hackers, the most powerful and technically accomplished,\r\nwere not professional fraudsters.  They raided computers habitually,\r\nbut wouldn't alter anything, or damage anything.  They didn't even steal\r\ncomputer equipment--most had day-jobs messing with hardware,\r\nand could get all the cheap secondhand equipment they wanted.\r\nThe hottest hackers, unlike the teenage wannabes, weren't snobs\r\nabout fancy or expensive hardware.  Their machines tended to be\r\nraw second-hand digital hot-rods full of custom add-ons that\r\nthey'd cobbled together out of chickenwire, memory chips and spit.\r\nSome were adults, computer software writers and consultants by trade,\r\nand making quite good livings at it.  Some of them ACTUALLY WORKED\r\nFOR THE PHONE COMPANY--and for those, the \"hackers\" actually found\r\nunder the skirts of Ma Bell, there would be little mercy in 1990.\r\n\r\nIt has long been an article of faith in the\r\nunderground that the \"best\" hackers never get caught.\r\nThey're far too smart, supposedly.  They never get caught\r\nbecause they never boast, brag, or strut.  These demigods\r\nmay read underground boards (with a condescending smile),\r\nbut they never say anything there.  The \"best\" hackers,\r\naccording to legend, are adult computer professionals,\r\nsuch as mainframe system administrators, who already know\r\nthe ins and outs of their particular brand of security.\r\nEven the \"best\" hacker can't break in to just any computer at random:\r\nthe knowledge of security holes is too specialized, varying widely\r\nwith different software and hardware.  But if people are employed to run,\r\nsay, a UNIX mainframe or a VAX/VMS machine, then they tend to learn\r\nsecurity from the inside out.  Armed with this knowledge,\r\nthey can look into most anybody else's UNIX or VMS\r\nwithout much trouble or risk, if they want to.\r\nAnd, according to hacker legend, of course they want to,\r\nso of course they do.  They just don't make a big deal\r\nof what they've done.  So nobody ever finds out.\r\n\r\nIt is also an article of faith in the underground that\r\nprofessional telco people \"phreak\" like crazed weasels.\r\nOF COURSE they spy on Madonna's phone calls--I mean,\r\nWOULDN'T YOU?  Of course they give themselves free long-\r\ndistance--why the hell should THEY pay, they're running\r\nthe whole shebang!\r\n\r\nIt has, as a third matter, long been an article of faith\r\nthat any hacker caught can escape serious punishment if\r\nhe confesses HOW HE DID IT.  Hackers seem to believe\r\nthat governmental agencies and large corporations are\r\nblundering about in cyberspace like eyeless jellyfish\r\nor cave salamanders.  They feel that these large\r\nbut pathetically stupid organizations will proffer up\r\ngenuine gratitude, and perhaps even a security post\r\nand a big salary, to the hot-shot intruder who will deign\r\nto reveal to them the supreme genius of his modus operandi.\r\n\r\nIn the case of longtime LoD member \"Control-C,\"\r\nthis actually happened, more or less.  Control-C had led\r\nMichigan Bell a merry chase, and when captured in 1987,\r\nhe turned out to be a bright and apparently physically\r\nharmless young fanatic, fascinated by phones.  There was\r\nno chance in hell that Control-C would actually repay the\r\nenormous and largely theoretical sums in long-distance\r\nservice that he had accumulated from Michigan Bell.\r\nHe could always be indicted for fraud or computer-intrusion,\r\nbut there seemed little real point in this--he hadn't\r\nphysically damaged any computer.  He'd just plead guilty,\r\nand he'd likely get the usual slap-on-the-wrist,\r\nand in the meantime it would be a big hassle for Michigan Bell\r\njust to bring up the case.  But if kept on the payroll,\r\nhe might at least keep his fellow hackers at bay.\r\n\r\nThere were uses for him.  For instance, a contrite\r\nControl-C was featured on Michigan Bell internal posters,\r\nsternly warning employees to shred their trash.\r\nHe'd always gotten most of his best inside info from\r\n\"trashing\"--raiding telco dumpsters, for useful data\r\nindiscreetly thrown away.  He signed these posters, too.\r\nControl-C had become something like a Michigan Bell mascot.\r\nAnd in fact, Control-C DID keep other hackers at bay.\r\nLittle hackers were quite scared of Control-C and his\r\nheavy-duty Legion of Doom friends.  And big hackers WERE\r\nhis friends and didn't want to screw up his cushy situation.\r\n\r\nNo matter what one might say of LoD, they did stick together.\r\nWhen \"Wasp,\" an apparently genuinely malicious New York hacker,\r\nbegan crashing Bellcore machines, Control-C received swift volunteer\r\nhelp from \"the Mentor\" and the Georgia LoD wing  made up of\r\n\"The Prophet,\" \"Urvile,\" and \"Leftist.\"  Using Mentor's Phoenix\r\nProject board to coordinate, the Doomsters helped telco security\r\nto trap Wasp, by luring him into a machine with a tap\r\nand line-trace installed.  Wasp lost.  LoD won!  And my, did they brag.\r\n\r\nUrvile, Prophet and Leftist were well-qualified for this activity,\r\nprobably more so even than the quite accomplished Control-C.\r\nThe Georgia boys knew all about phone switching-stations.\r\nThough relative johnny-come-latelies in the Legion of Doom,\r\nthey were considered some of LoD's heaviest guys,\r\ninto the hairiest systems around.  They had the good fortune\r\nto live in or near Atlanta, home of the sleepy and apparently\r\ntolerant BellSouth RBOC.\r\n\r\nAs RBOC security went, BellSouth were \"cake.\"  US West (of Arizona,\r\nthe Rockies and the Pacific Northwest) were tough and aggressive,\r\nprobably the heaviest RBOC around.  Pacific Bell, California's PacBell,\r\nwere sleek, high-tech, and longtime veterans of the LA phone-phreak wars.\r\nNYNEX had the misfortune to run the New York City area, and were warily\r\nprepared for most anything.  Even Michigan Bell, a division of the\r\nAmeritech RBOC, at least had the elementary sense to hire their own hacker\r\nas a useful scarecrow.  But BellSouth, even though their corporate P.R.\r\nproclaimed them to have \"Everything You Expect From a Leader,\" were pathetic.\r\n\r\nWhen rumor about LoD's mastery of Georgia's switching network got around\r\nto BellSouth through Bellcore and telco security scuttlebutt,\r\nthey at first refused to believe it.  If you paid serious attention\r\nto every rumor out and about these hacker kids, you would hear all kinds\r\nof wacko saucer-nut nonsense:  that the National Security Agency\r\nmonitored all American phone calls, that the CIA and DEA tracked\r\ntraffic on bulletin-boards with word-analysis programs,\r\nthat the Condor could start World War III from a payphone.\r\n\r\nIf there were hackers into BellSouth switching-stations, then how come\r\nnothing had happened?  Nothing had been hurt.  BellSouth's machines\r\nweren't crashing.  BellSouth wasn't suffering especially badly from fraud.\r\nBellSouth's customers weren't complaining.  BellSouth was headquartered\r\nin Atlanta, ambitious metropolis of the new high-tech Sunbelt;\r\nand BellSouth was upgrading its network by leaps and bounds,\r\ndigitizing the works left right and center.  They could hardly be\r\nconsidered sluggish or naive.  BellSouth's technical expertise\r\nwas second to none, thank you kindly.  But then came the Florida business.\r\n\r\nOn June 13, 1989, callers to the Palm Beach County Probation Department,\r\nin Delray Beach, Florida, found themselves involved in a remarkable\r\ndiscussion with a phone-sex worker named \"Tina\" in New York State.\r\nSomehow, ANY call to this probation office near Miami was instantly\r\nand magically transported across state lines, at no extra charge to the user,\r\nto a pornographic phone-sex hotline hundreds of miles away!\r\n\r\nThis practical joke may seem utterly hilarious at first hearing,\r\nand indeed there was a good deal of chuckling about it in\r\nphone phreak circles, including the Autumn 1989 issue of 2600.\r\nBut for Southern Bell (the division of the BellSouth RBOC\r\nsupplying local service for Florida, Georgia, North Carolina\r\nand South Carolina), this was a smoking gun.  For the first time ever,\r\na computer intruder had broken into a BellSouth central office\r\nswitching station and re-programmed it!\r\n\r\nOr so BellSouth thought in June 1989.  Actually, LoD members had been\r\nfrolicking harmlessly in BellSouth switches since September 1987.\r\nThe stunt of June 13--call-forwarding a number through manipulation\r\nof a switching station--was child's play for hackers as accomplished\r\nas the Georgia wing of LoD.  Switching calls interstate sounded like\r\na big deal, but it took only four lines of code to accomplish this.\r\nAn easy, yet more discreet, stunt, would be to call-forward another\r\nnumber to your own house.  If you were careful and considerate,\r\nand changed the software back later, then not a soul would know.\r\nExcept you.  And whoever you had bragged to about it.\r\n\r\nAs for BellSouth, what they didn't know wouldn't hurt them.\r\n\r\nExcept now somebody had blown the whole thing wide open, and BellSouth knew.\r\n\r\nA now alerted and considerably paranoid BellSouth began searching switches\r\nright and left for signs of impropriety, in that hot summer of 1989.\r\nNo fewer than forty-two BellSouth employees were put on 12-hour shifts,\r\ntwenty-four hours a day, for two solid months, poring over records\r\nand monitoring computers for any sign of phony access.  These forty-two\r\noverworked experts were known as BellSouth's  \"Intrusion Task Force.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the investigators found astounded them.  Proprietary telco databases\r\nhad been manipulated:  phone numbers had been created out of thin air,\r\nwith no users' names and no addresses.  And perhaps worst of all,\r\nno charges and no records of use.  The new digital ReMOB (Remote Observation)\r\ndiagnostic feature had been extensively tampered with--hackers had learned to\r\nreprogram ReMOB software, so that they could listen in on any switch-routed\r\ncall at their leisure!  They were using telco property to SPY!\r\n\r\nThe electrifying news went out throughout law enforcement in 1989.\r\nIt had never really occurred to anyone at BellSouth that their prized\r\nand brand-new digital switching-stations could be RE-PROGRAMMED.\r\nPeople seemed utterly amazed that anyone could have the nerve.\r\nOf course these switching stations were \"computers,\" and everybody\r\nknew hackers liked to \"break into computers:\"  but telephone people's\r\ncomputers were DIFFERENT from normal people's computers.\r\n\r\nThe exact reason WHY these computers were \"different\" was\r\nrather ill-defined.  It certainly wasn't the extent of their security.\r\nThe security on these BellSouth computers was lousy;  the AIMSX computers,\r\nfor instance, didn't even have passwords.  But there was no question that\r\nBellSouth strongly FELT that their computers were very different indeed.\r\nAnd if there were some criminals out there who had not gotten that message,\r\nBellSouth was determined to see that message taught.\r\n\r\nAfter all, a 5ESS switching station was no mere bookkeeping system for\r\nsome local chain of florists.  Public service depended on these stations.\r\nPublic SAFETY depended on these stations.\r\n\r\nAnd hackers, lurking in there call-forwarding or ReMobbing, could spy\r\non anybody in the local area!  They could spy on telco officials!\r\nThey could spy on police stations!  They could spy on local offices\r\nof the Secret Service. . . .\r\n\r\nIn 1989, electronic cops and hacker-trackers began using scrambler-phones\r\nand secured lines.  It only made sense.  There was no telling who was into\r\nthose systems.  Whoever they were, they sounded scary.  This was some\r\nnew level of antisocial daring.  Could be West German hackers, in the pay\r\nof the KGB.  That too had seemed a weird and farfetched notion,\r\nuntil Clifford Stoll had poked and prodded a sluggish Washington\r\nlaw-enforcement bureaucracy into investigating a computer intrusion\r\nthat turned out to be exactly that--HACKERS, IN THE PAY OF THE KGB!\r\nStoll, the  systems manager for an Internet lab in Berkeley California,\r\nhad ended up on the front page of the New Nork Times, proclaimed a national\r\nhero in the first true story of international computer espionage.\r\nStoll's counterspy efforts, which he related in a bestselling book,\r\nThe Cuckoo's Egg, in 1989, had established the credibility of `hacking'\r\nas a possible threat to national security.  The United States Secret Service\r\ndoesn't mess around when it suspects a possible action by a foreign\r\nintelligence apparat.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service scrambler-phones and secured lines put\r\na tremendous kink in law enforcement's ability to operate freely;\r\nto get the word out, cooperate, prevent misunderstandings.\r\nNevertheless, 1989 scarcely seemed the time for half-measures.\r\nIf the police and Secret Service themselves were not operationally secure,\r\nthen how could they reasonably demand measures of security from\r\nprivate enterprise?  At least, the inconvenience made people aware\r\nof the seriousness  of the threat.\r\n\r\nIf there was a final spur needed to get the police off the dime,\r\nit came in the realization that the emergency 911 system was vulnerable.\r\nThe 911 system has its own specialized software, but it is run on the same\r\ndigital switching systems as the rest of the telephone network.\r\n911 is not physically different from normal telephony.  But it is\r\ncertainly culturally different, because this is the area of\r\ntelephonic cyberspace reserved for the police and emergency services.\r\n\r\nYour average policeman may not know much about hackers or phone-phreaks.\r\nComputer people are weird; even computer COPS  are rather weird;\r\nthe stuff they do is hard to figure out.  But a threat to the 911 system\r\nis anything but an abstract threat.  If the 911 system goes, people can die.\r\n\r\nImagine being in a car-wreck, staggering to a phone-booth,\r\npunching 911 and hearing \"Tina\" pick up the phone-sex line\r\nsomewhere in New York!  The situation's no longer comical, somehow.\r\n\r\nAnd was it possible?  No question.  Hackers had attacked 911\r\nsystems before.  Phreaks can max-out 911 systems just by siccing\r\na bunch of computer-modems on them in tandem, dialling them over\r\nand over until they clog.  That's very crude and low-tech,\r\nbut it's still a serious business.\r\n\r\nThe time had come for action.  It was time to take stern measures\r\nwith the underground.  It was time to start picking up the dropped threads,\r\nthe loose edges, the bits of braggadocio here and there; it was time to get\r\non the stick and start putting serious casework together.  Hackers weren't\r\n\"invisible.\"  They THOUGHT  they were invisible; but the truth was,\r\nthey had just been tolerated too long.\r\n\r\nUnder sustained police attention in the summer of '89, the digital\r\nunderground began to unravel as never before.\r\n\r\nThe first big break in the case came very early on:  July 1989,\r\nthe following month.  The perpetrator of the \"Tina\" switch was caught,\r\nand confessed.  His name was \"Fry Guy,\" a 16-year-old in Indiana.\r\nFry Guy had been a very wicked young man.\r\n\r\nFry Guy had earned his handle from a stunt involving French fries.\r\nFry Guy had filched the log-in of a local MacDonald's manager\r\nand had logged-on to the MacDonald's mainframe on the Sprint\r\nTelenet system. Posing as the manager, Fry Guy had altered\r\nMacDonald's records, and given some teenage hamburger-flipping\r\nfriends of his, generous raises.  He had not been caught.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by success, Fry Guy moved on to credit-card abuse.\r\nFry Guy was quite an accomplished talker; with a gift for\r\n\"social engineering.\"  If you can do \"social engineering\"\r\n--fast-talk, fake-outs, impersonation, conning, scamming--\r\nthen card abuse comes easy.  (Getting away with it in\r\nthe long run is another question).\r\n\r\nFry Guy had run across \"Urvile\" of the Legion of Doom\r\non the ALTOS Chat board in Bonn, Germany.  ALTOS Chat\r\nwas a sophisticated board, accessible through globe-spanning\r\ncomputer networks like BITnet, Tymnet, and Telenet.\r\nALTOS was much frequented by members of Germany's\r\nChaos Computer Club.  Two Chaos hackers who hung out on ALTOS,\r\n\"Jaeger\" and \"Pengo,\" had been the central villains of\r\nClifford Stoll's Cuckoo's Egg case:  consorting in East Berlin\r\nwith a spymaster from the KGB, and breaking into American\r\ncomputers for hire, through the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhen LoD members learned the story of Jaeger's depredations\r\nfrom Stoll's book, they were rather less than impressed,\r\ntechnically speaking.  On LoD's own favorite board of the moment,\r\n\"Black Ice,\" LoD members bragged that they themselves could have done\r\nall the Chaos break-ins in a week flat!  Nevertheless, LoD were grudgingly\r\nimpressed by the Chaos rep, the sheer hairy-eyed daring of hash-smoking\r\nanarchist hackers who had rubbed shoulders with the fearsome big-boys\r\nof international Communist espionage.  LoD members sometimes traded\r\nbits of knowledge with friendly German hackers on ALTOS--phone numbers\r\nfor vulnerable VAX/VMS computers in Georgia, for instance.\r\nDutch and British phone phreaks, and the Australian clique of\r\n\"Phoenix,\" \"Nom,\" and \"Electron,\" were ALTOS regulars, too.\r\nIn underground circles, to hang out on ALTOS was considered\r\nthe sign of an elite dude, a sophisticated hacker of the\r\ninternational digital jet-set.\r\n\r\nFry Guy quickly learned how to raid information from credit-card\r\nconsumer-reporting agencies.  He had over a hundred stolen credit-card\r\nnumbers in his notebooks, and upwards of a thousand swiped long-distance\r\naccess codes.  He knew how to get onto Altos, and how to talk the talk of\r\nthe underground convincingly.  He now wheedled knowledge of switching-station\r\ntricks from Urvile on the ALTOS system.\r\n\r\nCombining these two forms of knowledge enabled Fry Guy to bootstrap\r\nhis way up to a new form of wire-fraud.  First, he'd snitched credit card\r\nnumbers from credit-company computers.  The data he copied included names,\r\naddresses and phone numbers of the random card-holders.\r\n\r\nThen Fry Guy, impersonating a card-holder, called up Western Union\r\nand asked for a cash advance on \"his\" credit card.  Western Union,\r\nas a security guarantee, would call the customer back, at home,\r\nto verify the transaction.\r\n\r\nBut, just as he had switched the Florida probation office to \"Tina\"\r\nin New York, Fry Guy switched the card-holder's number to a local pay-phone.\r\nThere he would lurk in wait, muddying his trail by routing and re-routing\r\nthe call, through switches as far away as Canada.  When the call came through,\r\nhe would boldly \"social-engineer,\" or con, the Western Union people, pretending\r\nto be the legitimate card-holder.  Since he'd answered the proper phone number,\r\nthe deception was not very hard.  Western Union's money was then shipped to\r\na confederate of Fry Guy's in his home town in Indiana.\r\n\r\nFry Guy and his cohort, using LoD techniques, stole six thousand dollars\r\nfrom Western Union between December 1988 and July 1989.  They also dabbled\r\nin ordering delivery of stolen goods through card-fraud.  Fry Guy\r\nwas intoxicated with success.  The sixteen-year-old fantasized wildly\r\nto hacker rivals, boasting that he'd used rip-off money to hire himself\r\na big limousine, and had driven out-of-state with a groupie from\r\nhis favorite heavy-metal band, Motley Crue.\r\n\r\nArmed with knowledge, power, and a gratifying stream of free money,\r\nFry Guy now took it upon himself to call local representatives\r\nof Indiana Bell security, to brag, boast, strut, and utter\r\ntormenting warnings that his powerful friends in the notorious\r\nLegion of Doom could crash the national telephone network.\r\nFry Guy even named a date for the scheme:  the Fourth of July,\r\na national holiday.\r\n\r\nThis egregious example of the begging-for-arrest syndrome was shortly\r\nfollowed by Fry Guy's arrest.  After the Indiana telephone company figured\r\nout who he was, the Secret Service had DNRs--Dialed Number Recorders--\r\ninstalled on his home phone lines.  These devices are not taps, and can't\r\nrecord the substance of phone calls, but they do record the phone numbers\r\nof all calls going in and out.  Tracing these numbers showed Fry Guy's\r\nlong-distance code fraud, his extensive ties to pirate bulletin boards,\r\nand numerous personal calls to his LoD friends in Atlanta.  By July 11,\r\n1989, Prophet, Urvile and Leftist also had Secret Service DNR\r\n\"pen registers\" installed on their own lines.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service showed up in force at Fry Guy's house on July 22, 1989,\r\nto the horror of his unsuspecting parents.  The raiders were led by\r\na special agent from the Secret Service's Indianapolis office.\r\nHowever, the raiders were accompanied and advised by Timothy M. Foley\r\nof the Secret Service's Chicago office (a gentleman about whom\r\nwe will soon be hearing a great deal).\r\n\r\nFollowing federal computer-crime techniques that had been standard\r\nsince the early 1980s, the Secret Service searched the house thoroughly,\r\nand seized all of Fry Guy's electronic equipment and notebooks.\r\nAll Fry Guy's equipment went out the door in the custody of the\r\nSecret Service, which put a swift end to his depredations.\r\n\r\nThe USSS interrogated Fry Guy at length.  His case was put in the charge\r\nof Deborah Daniels, the federal US Attorney for the Southern District\r\nof Indiana.  Fry Guy was charged with eleven counts of computer fraud,\r\nunauthorized computer access, and wire fraud.  The evidence was thorough\r\nand irrefutable.  For his part, Fry Guy blamed his corruption on the\r\nLegion of Doom and offered to testify against them.\r\n\r\nFry Guy insisted that the Legion intended to crash the phone system\r\non a national holiday.  And when AT&T crashed on Martin Luther King Day,\r\n1990, this lent a credence to his claim that genuinely alarmed telco\r\nsecurity and the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nFry Guy eventually pled guilty on May 31, 1990.  On September 14,\r\nhe was sentenced to forty-four months' probation and four hundred hours'\r\ncommunity service.  He could have had it much worse; but it made sense\r\nto prosecutors to take it easy on this teenage minor, while zeroing\r\nin on the notorious kingpins of the Legion of Doom.\r\n\r\nBut the case against LoD had nagging flaws.  Despite the best effort\r\nof investigators, it was impossible to prove that the Legion had crashed\r\nthe phone system on January 15, because they, in fact, hadn't done so.\r\nThe investigations of 1989 did show that certain members of\r\nthe Legion of Doom had achieved unprecedented power over the telco\r\nswitching stations, and that they were in active conspiracy\r\nto obtain more power yet.  Investigators were privately convinced\r\nthat the Legion of Doom intended to do awful things with this knowledge,\r\nbut mere evil intent was not enough to put them in jail.\r\n\r\nAnd although the Atlanta Three--Prophet, Leftist, and especially Urvile--\r\nhad taught Fry Guy plenty, they were not themselves credit-card fraudsters.\r\nThe only thing they'd \"stolen\" was long-distance service--and since they'd\r\ndone much of that through phone-switch manipulation, there was no easy way\r\nto judge how much they'd \"stolen,\" or whether this practice was even \"theft\"\r\nof any easily recognizable kind.\r\n\r\nFry Guy's theft of long-distance codes had cost the phone companies plenty.\r\nThe theft of long-distance service may be a fairly theoretical \"loss,\"\r\nbut it costs genuine money and genuine time to delete all those stolen codes,\r\nand to re-issue new codes to the innocent owners of those corrupted codes.\r\nThe owners of the codes themselves are victimized, and lose time and money\r\nand peace of mind in the hassle.  And then there were the credit-card victims\r\nto deal with, too, and Western Union.  When it came to rip-off, Fry Guy was\r\nfar more of a thief than LoD.  It was only when it came to actual computer\r\nexpertise that Fry Guy was small potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta Legion thought most \"rules\" of cyberspace were for rodents\r\nand losers, but they DID have rules.  THEY NEVER CRASHED ANYTHING,\r\nAND THEY NEVER TOOK MONEY.  These were rough rules-of-thumb, and\r\nrather dubious principles when it comes to the ethical subtleties\r\nof cyberspace, but they enabled the Atlanta Three to operate with\r\na relatively clear conscience (though never with peace of mind).\r\n\r\nIf you didn't hack for money, if you weren't robbing people of actual funds\r\n--money in the bank, that is-- then nobody REALLY got hurt, in LoD's opinion.\r\n\"Theft of service\" was a bogus issue, and \"intellectual property\" was\r\na bad joke.  But LoD had only elitist contempt for rip-off artists,\r\n\"leechers,\" thieves.  They considered themselves clean.  In their opinion,\r\nif you didn't smash-up or crash any systems --(well, not on purpose, anyhow--\r\naccidents can happen, just ask Robert Morris)  then it was very unfair\r\nto call you a \"vandal\" or a \"cracker.\"  When you were hanging out on-line\r\nwith your \"pals\" in telco security, you could face them down from the higher\r\nplane of hacker morality.  And you could mock the police from the supercilious\r\nheights of your hacker's quest for pure knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut from the point of view of law enforcement and telco security, however,\r\nFry Guy was not really dangerous.  The Atlanta Three WERE dangerous.\r\nIt wasn't the crimes they were committing, but the DANGER,\r\nthe potential hazard, the sheer TECHNICAL POWER LoD had accumulated,\r\nthat had made the situation untenable.  Fry Guy was not LoD.\r\nHe'd never laid eyes on anyone in LoD; his only contacts with them\r\nhad been electronic.  Core members of the Legion of Doom tended to meet\r\nphysically for conventions every year or so, to get drunk, give each other\r\nthe hacker high-sign, send out for pizza and ravage hotel suites.\r\nFry Guy had never done any of this.  Deborah Daniels assessed Fry Guy\r\naccurately as \"an LoD wannabe.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless Fry Guy's crimes would be directly attributed to LoD\r\nin much future police propaganda.  LoD would be described as\r\n\"a closely knit group\" involved in \"numerous illegal activities\"\r\nincluding \"stealing and modifying individual credit histories,\"\r\nand \"fraudulently obtaining money and property.\"  Fry Guy did this,\r\nbut the Atlanta Three didn't; they simply weren't into theft,\r\nbut rather intrusion.  This caused a strange kink in\r\nthe prosecution's strategy.  LoD were accused of\r\n\"disseminating information about attacking computers\r\nto other computer hackers in an effort to shift the focus\r\nof law enforcement to those other hackers and away from the Legion of Doom.\"\r\n\r\nThis last accusation (taken directly from a press release by the Chicago\r\nComputer Fraud and Abuse Task Force) sounds particularly far-fetched.\r\nOne might conclude at this point that investigators would have been\r\nwell-advised to go ahead and \"shift their focus\" from the \"Legion of Doom.\"\r\nMaybe they SHOULD concentrate on \"those other hackers\"--the ones who were\r\nactually stealing money and physical objects.\r\n\r\nBut the Hacker Crackdown of 1990 was not a simple policing action.\r\nIt wasn't meant just to walk the beat in cyberspace--it was a CRACKDOWN,\r\na deliberate attempt to nail the core of the operation, to send a dire\r\nand potent message that would settle the hash of the digital underground\r\nfor good.\r\n\r\nBy this reasoning, Fry Guy wasn't much more than the electronic equivalent\r\nof a cheap streetcorner dope dealer.  As long as the masterminds of LoD were\r\nstill flagrantly operating, pushing their mountains of illicit knowledge\r\nright and left, and whipping up enthusiasm for blatant lawbreaking,\r\nthen there would be an INFINITE SUPPLY of Fry Guys.\r\n\r\nBecause LoD were flagrant, they had left trails everywhere,\r\nto be picked up by law enforcement in New York, Indiana,\r\nFlorida, Texas, Arizona, Missouri, even Australia.\r\nBut 1990's war on the Legion of Doom was led out of Illinois,\r\nby the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force, led by federal prosecutor\r\nWilliam J. Cook, had started in 1987 and had swiftly become one\r\nof the most aggressive local \"dedicated computer-crime units.\"\r\nChicago was a natural home for such a group.  The world's first\r\ncomputer bulletin-board system had been invented in Illinois.\r\nThe state of Illinois had some of the nation's first and sternest\r\ncomputer crime laws.  Illinois State Police were markedly alert\r\nto the possibilities of white-collar crime and electronic fraud.\r\n\r\nAnd William J. Cook in particular was a rising star in\r\nelectronic crime-busting.  He and his fellow federal prosecutors\r\nat the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago had a tight relation\r\nwith the Secret Service, especially go-getting Chicago-based agent\r\nTimothy Foley.  While Cook and his Department of Justice colleagues\r\nplotted strategy, Foley was their man on the street.\r\n\r\nThroughout the 1980s, the federal government had given prosecutors\r\nan armory of new, untried legal tools against computer crime.\r\nCook and his colleagues were pioneers in the use of these new statutes\r\nin the real-life cut-and-thrust of the federal courtroom.\r\n\r\nOn October 2, 1986, the US Senate had passed the\r\n\"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\" unanimously, but there\r\nwere pitifully few convictions under this statute.\r\nCook's group took their name from this statute,\r\nsince they were determined to transform this powerful but\r\nrather theoretical Act of Congress into a real-life engine\r\nof legal destruction against computer fraudsters and scofflaws.\r\n\r\nIt was not a question of merely discovering crimes,\r\ninvestigating them, and then trying and punishing their\r\nperpetrators.  The Chicago unit, like most everyone else\r\nin the business, already KNEW who the bad guys were:\r\nthe Legion of Doom and the writers and editors of Phrack.\r\nThe task at hand was to find some legal means of putting\r\nthese characters away.\r\n\r\nThis approach might seem a bit dubious, to someone not\r\nacquainted with the gritty realities of prosecutorial work.\r\nBut prosecutors don't put people in jail for crimes\r\nthey have committed; they put people in jail for crimes\r\nthey have committed THAT CAN BE PROVED IN COURT.\r\nChicago federal police put Al Capone in prison\r\nfor income-tax fraud.  Chicago is a big town,\r\nwith a rough-and-ready bare-knuckle tradition\r\non both sides of the law.\r\n\r\nFry Guy had broken the case wide open and alerted telco security\r\nto the scope of the problem.  But Fry Guy's crimes would not\r\nput the Atlanta Three behind bars--much less the wacko underground\r\njournalists of Phrack.  So on July 22, 1989, the same day that\r\nFry Guy was raided in Indiana, the Secret Service descended upon\r\nthe Atlanta Three.\r\n\r\nThis was likely inevitable.  By the summer of 1989, law enforcement\r\nwere closing in on the Atlanta Three from at least six directions at once.\r\nFirst, there were the leads from Fry Guy, which had led to the DNR registers\r\nbeing installed on the lines of the Atlanta Three.  The DNR evidence alone\r\nwould have finished them off, sooner or later.\r\n\r\nBut second, the Atlanta lads were already well-known to Control-C\r\nand his telco security sponsors.  LoD's contacts with telco security\r\nhad made them overconfident and even more boastful than usual;\r\nthey felt that they had powerful friends in high places,\r\nand that they were being openly tolerated by telco security.\r\nBut BellSouth's Intrusion Task Force were hot on the trail of LoD\r\nand sparing no effort or expense.\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta Three had also been identified by name and listed\r\non the extensive anti-hacker files maintained, and retailed for pay,\r\nby private security operative John Maxfield of Detroit.\r\nMaxfield, who had extensive ties to telco security\r\nand many informants in the underground, was a bete noire\r\nof the Phrack crowd, and the dislike was mutual.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta Three themselves had written articles for Phrack.\r\nThis boastful act could not possibly escape telco and law enforcement\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"Knightmare,\" a high-school age hacker from Arizona,\r\nwas a close friend and disciple of Atlanta LoD,\r\nbut he had been nabbed by the formidable Arizona\r\nOrganized Crime and Racketeering Unit.  Knightmare was\r\non some of LoD's favorite boards--\"Black Ice\" in particular--\r\nand was privy to their secrets.  And to have Gail Thackeray,\r\nthe Assistant Attorney General of Arizona, on one's trail\r\nwas a dreadful peril for any hacker.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps worst of all, Prophet had committed a major blunder\r\nby passing an illicitly copied BellSouth computer-file to Knight Lightning,\r\nwho had published it in Phrack.  This, as we will see, was an act of dire\r\nconsequence for almost everyone concerned.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1989, the Secret Service showed up at the Leftist's house,\r\nwhere he lived with his parents.  A massive squad of some twenty officers\r\nsurrounded the building:  Secret Service, federal marshals, local police,\r\npossibly BellSouth telco security; it was hard to tell in the crush.\r\nLeftist's dad, at work in his basement office, first noticed\r\na muscular stranger in plain clothes crashing through the\r\nback yard with a drawn pistol.  As more strangers poured\r\ninto the house, Leftist's dad naturally assumed there was\r\nan armed robbery in progress.\r\n\r\nLike most hacker parents, Leftist's mom and dad had only the vaguest\r\nnotions of what their son had been up to all this time.  Leftist had\r\na day-job repairing computer hardware.  His obsession with computers\r\nseemed a bit odd, but harmless enough, and likely to produce a well-\r\npaying career.  The sudden, overwhelming raid left Leftist's\r\nparents traumatized.\r\n\r\nThe Leftist himself had been out after work with his co-workers,\r\nsurrounding a couple of pitchers of margaritas.  As he came trucking\r\non tequila-numbed feet up the pavement, toting a bag full of floppy-disks,\r\nhe noticed a large number of unmarked cars parked in his driveway.\r\nAll the cars sported tiny microwave antennas.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service had knocked the front door off its hinges,\r\nalmost flattening his mom.\r\n\r\nInside, Leftist was greeted by Special Agent James Cool\r\nof the US Secret Service, Atlanta office.  Leftist was flabbergasted.\r\nHe'd never met a Secret Service agent before.  He could not imagine\r\nthat he'd ever done anything worthy of federal attention.\r\nHe'd always figured that if his activities became intolerable,\r\none of his contacts in telco security would give him a private\r\nphone-call and tell him to knock it off.\r\n\r\nBut now Leftist was pat-searched for weapons by grim professionals,\r\nand his bag of floppies was quickly seized.  He and his parents were\r\nall shepherded into separate rooms and grilled at length as a score\r\nof officers scoured their home for anything electronic.\r\n\r\nLeftist was horrified as his treasured IBM AT personal computer\r\nwith its forty-meg hard disk, and his recently purchased 80386 IBM-clone\r\nwith a whopping hundred-meg hard disk, both went swiftly out the door\r\nin Secret Service custody.  They also seized all his disks, all his notebooks,\r\nand a tremendous booty in dogeared telco documents that Leftist had snitched\r\nout of trash dumpsters.\r\n\r\nLeftist figured the whole thing for a big misunderstanding.\r\nHe'd never been into MILITARY computers.  He wasn't a SPY or a COMMUNIST.\r\nHe  was just a good ol' Georgia hacker, and now he just wanted all these\r\npeople out of the house.  But it seemed they wouldn't go until he made\r\nsome kind of statement.\r\n\r\nAnd so, he levelled with them.\r\n\r\nAnd that, Leftist said later from his federal prison camp in Talladega,\r\nAlabama, was a big mistake.  The Atlanta area was unique,\r\nin that it had three members of the Legion of Doom who actually\r\noccupied more or less the same physical locality.  Unlike the rest\r\nof LoD, who tended to associate by phone and computer,\r\nAtlanta LoD actually WERE \"tightly knit.\"  It was no real\r\nsurprise that the Secret Service agents apprehending Urvile\r\nat the computer-labs at Georgia Tech, would discover Prophet\r\nwith him as well.\r\n\r\nUrvile, a 21-year-old Georgia Tech student in polymer chemistry,\r\nposed quite a puzzling case for law enforcement.  Urvile--also known\r\nas \"Necron 99,\" as well as other handles, for he tended to change his\r\ncover-alias about once a month--was both an accomplished hacker\r\nand a fanatic simulation-gamer.\r\n\r\nSimulation games are an unusual hobby; but then hackers are unusual people,\r\nand their favorite pastimes tend to be somewhat out of the ordinary.\r\nThe best-known American simulation game is probably \"Dungeons & Dragons,\"\r\na multi-player parlor entertainment played with paper, maps, pencils,\r\nstatistical tables and a variety of oddly-shaped dice.  Players pretend\r\nto be heroic characters exploring a wholly-invented fantasy world.\r\nThe fantasy worlds of simulation gaming are commonly pseudo-medieval,\r\ninvolving swords and sorcery--spell-casting wizards, knights in armor,\r\nunicorns and dragons, demons and goblins.\r\n\r\nUrvile and his fellow gamers  preferred their fantasies highly technological.\r\nThey made use of a game known as \"G.U.R.P.S.,\" the \"Generic Universal Role\r\nPlaying System,\" published by a company called Steve Jackson Games (SJG).\r\n\r\n\"G.U.R.P.S.\"  served as a framework for creating a wide variety of artificial\r\nfantasy worlds.  Steve Jackson Games published  a smorgasboard of books,\r\nfull of detailed information and gaming hints, which were used to flesh-out\r\nmany different fantastic backgrounds for the basic GURPS framework.\r\nUrvile made extensive use of two SJG books called GURPS High-Tech\r\nand GURPS Special Ops.\r\n\r\nIn the artificial fantasy-world of GURPS Special Ops,\r\nplayers entered a modern  fantasy of intrigue and international espionage.\r\nOn beginning the game, players started small and powerless,\r\nperhaps as minor-league CIA agents or penny-ante arms dealers.\r\nBut as players persisted through a series of game sessions\r\n(game sessions generally lasted for hours, over long,\r\nelaborate campaigns that might be pursued for months on end)\r\nthen they would achieve new skills, new knowledge, new power.\r\nThey would acquire and hone new abilities, such as marksmanship,\r\nkarate, wiretapping, or Watergate burglary.  They could also win\r\nvarious kinds of imaginary booty, like Berettas, or martini shakers,\r\nor fast cars with ejection seats and machine-guns under the headlights.\r\n\r\nAs might be imagined from the complexity of these games,\r\nUrvile's gaming notes were very detailed and extensive.\r\nUrvile was a \"dungeon-master,\" inventing scenarios\r\nfor his fellow gamers, giant simulated adventure-puzzles\r\nfor his friends to unravel.  Urvile's game notes covered\r\ndozens of pages with all sorts of exotic lunacy, all about\r\nninja raids on Libya and break-ins on encrypted Red Chinese supercomputers.\r\nHis notes were written on scrap-paper and kept in loose-leaf binders.\r\n\r\nThe handiest scrap paper around Urvile's college digs were the many pounds of\r\nBellSouth printouts and documents that he had snitched out of telco dumpsters.\r\nHis notes were written on the back of misappropriated telco property.\r\nWorse yet, the gaming notes were chaotically interspersed with Urvile's\r\nhand-scrawled records involving ACTUAL COMPUTER INTRUSIONS that he\r\nhad committed.\r\n\r\nNot only was it next to impossible to tell Urvile's fantasy game-notes\r\nfrom cyberspace \"reality,\" but Urvile himself barely made this distinction.\r\nIt's no exaggeration to say that to Urvile it was ALL a game.  Urvile was\r\nvery bright, highly imaginative, and quite careless of other people's notions\r\nof propriety.  His connection to \"reality\" was not something to which he paid\r\na great deal of attention.\r\n\r\nHacking was a game for Urvile.  It was an amusement he was carrying out,\r\nit was something he was doing for fun.  And Urvile was an obsessive young man.\r\nHe could no more stop hacking than he could stop in the middle of\r\na jigsaw puzzle, or stop in the middle of reading a Stephen Donaldson\r\nfantasy trilogy.  (The name \"Urvile\" came from a best-selling Donaldson novel.)\r\n\r\nUrvile's airy, bulletproof attitude seriously annoyed his interrogators.\r\nFirst of all, he didn't consider that he'd done anything wrong.\r\nThere was scarcely a shred of honest remorse in him.  On the contrary,\r\nhe seemed privately convinced that his police interrogators were operating\r\nin a demented fantasy-world all their own.  Urvile was too polite\r\nand well-behaved to say this straight-out, but his reactions were askew\r\nand disquieting.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there was the business about LoD's ability\r\nto monitor phone-calls to the police and Secret Service.\r\nUrvile agreed that this was quite possible, and posed\r\nno big problem for LoD.  In fact, he and his friends\r\nhad kicked the idea around on the \"Black Ice\" board,\r\nmuch as they had discussed many other nifty notions,\r\nsuch as building personal flame-throwers and jury-rigging\r\nfistfulls of blasting-caps.  They had hundreds of dial-up numbers\r\nfor government agencies that they'd gotten through scanning Atlanta phones,\r\nor had pulled from raided VAX/VMS mainframe computers.\r\n\r\nBasically, they'd never gotten around to listening in on the cops\r\nbecause the idea wasn't interesting enough to bother with.\r\nBesides, if they'd been monitoring Secret Service phone calls,\r\nobviously they'd never have been caught in the first place.  Right?\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service was less than satisfied with this rapier-like hacker logic.\r\n\r\nThen there was the issue of crashing the phone system.  No problem,\r\nUrvile admitted sunnily.  Atlanta LoD could have shut down phone service\r\nall over Atlanta any time they liked.  EVEN THE 911 SERVICE?\r\nNothing special about that, Urvile explained patiently.\r\nBring the switch to its knees, with say the UNIX \"makedir\" bug,\r\nand 911 goes down too as a matter of course.  The 911 system\r\nwasn't very interesting, frankly.  It might be tremendously\r\ninteresting to cops (for odd reasons of their own), but as\r\ntechnical challenges went, the 911 service was yawnsville.\r\n\r\nSo of course the Atlanta Three could crash service.\r\nThey probably could have crashed service all over\r\nBellSouth territory, if they'd worked at it for a while.\r\nBut Atlanta LoD weren't crashers.  Only losers and rodents\r\nwere crashers.  LoD were ELITE.\r\n\r\nUrvile was privately convinced that sheer technical\r\nexpertise could win him free of any kind of problem.\r\nAs far as he was concerned, elite status in the digital\r\nunderground had placed him permanently beyond the intellectual\r\ngrasp of cops and straights.  Urvile had a lot to learn.\r\n\r\nOf the three LoD stalwarts, Prophet was in the most direct trouble.\r\nProphet was a UNIX programming expert who burrowed in and out\r\nof the Internet as a matter of course.  He'd started his hacking\r\ncareer at around age 14, meddling with a UNIX mainframe system\r\nat the University of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nProphet himself had written the handy Legion of Doom\r\nfile \"UNIX Use and Security From the Ground Up.\"\r\nUNIX (pronounced \"you-nicks\") is a powerful,\r\nflexible computer operating-system, for multi-user,\r\nmulti-tasking computers.  In 1969, when UNIX was created\r\nin Bell Labs, such computers were exclusive to large\r\ncorporations and universities, but today UNIX is run\r\non thousands of powerful home machines.  UNIX was\r\nparticularly well-suited to telecommunications programming,\r\nand had become a standard in the field.  Naturally, UNIX\r\nalso became a standard for the elite hacker and phone phreak.\r\nLately, Prophet had not been so active as Leftist and Urvile,\r\nbut Prophet was a recidivist.  In 1986, when he was eighteen,\r\nProphet had been convicted of \"unauthorized access\r\nto a computer network\" in North Carolina.  He'd been\r\ndiscovered breaking into the Southern Bell Data Network,\r\na UNIX-based internal telco network supposedly closed to the public.\r\nHe'd gotten a typical hacker sentence:  six months suspended,\r\n120 hours community service, and three years' probation.\r\n\r\nAfter that humiliating bust, Prophet had gotten rid of most of his\r\ntonnage of illicit phreak and hacker data, and had tried to go straight.\r\nHe was, after all, still on probation.  But by  the autumn of 1988,\r\nthe temptations of cyberspace had proved too much for young Prophet,\r\nand he was shoulder-to-shoulder with Urvile and Leftist into some\r\nof the hairiest systems around.\r\n\r\nIn early September 1988, he'd broken into BellSouth's centralized\r\nautomation system, AIMSX or \"Advanced Information Management System.\"\r\nAIMSX was an internal business network for BellSouth, where telco\r\nemployees stored electronic mail, databases, memos, and calendars,\r\nand did text processing.  Since AIMSX did not have public dial-ups,\r\nit was considered utterly invisible to the public, and was not well-secured\r\n--it didn't even require passwords.  Prophet abused an account known\r\nas \"waa1,\" the personal account of an unsuspecting telco employee.\r\nDisguised as the owner of waa1, Prophet made about ten visits to AIMSX.\r\n\r\nProphet did not damage or delete anything in the system.\r\nHis presence in AIMSX was harmless and almost invisible.\r\nBut he could not rest content with that.\r\n\r\nOne particular piece of processed text on AIMSX was a telco document\r\nknown as \"Bell South Standard Practice 660-225-104SV Control Office\r\nAdministration of Enhanced 911 Services for Special Services\r\nand Major Account Centers dated March 1988.\"\r\n\r\nProphet had not been looking for this document.  It was merely one\r\namong hundreds of similar documents with impenetrable titles.\r\nHowever, having blundered over it in the course of his illicit\r\nwanderings through AIMSX, he decided to take it with him as a trophy.\r\nIt might prove very useful in some future boasting, bragging,\r\nand strutting session.  So, some time in September 1988,\r\nProphet ordered the AIMSX mainframe computer to copy this document\r\n(henceforth called simply called \"the E911 Document\") and to transfer\r\nthis copy to his home computer.\r\n\r\nNo one noticed that Prophet had done this.  He had \"stolen\"\r\nthe E911 Document in some sense, but notions of property\r\nin cyberspace can be tricky.  BellSouth noticed nothing wrong,\r\nbecause BellSouth still had their original copy.  They had not\r\nbeen \"robbed\" of the document itself.  Many people were supposed\r\nto copy this document--specifically, people who worked for the\r\nnineteen BellSouth \"special services and major account centers,\"\r\nscattered throughout the Southeastern United States.  That was\r\nwhat it was for, why it was present on a computer network\r\nin the first place: so that it could be copied and read--\r\nby telco employees.  But now the data had been copied\r\nby someone who wasn't supposed to look at it.\r\n\r\nProphet now had his trophy.  But he further decided to store\r\nyet another copy of the E911 Document on another person's computer.\r\nThis unwitting person was a computer enthusiast named Richard Andrews\r\nwho lived near Joliet, Illinois.  Richard Andrews was a UNIX programmer\r\nby trade, and ran a powerful UNIX board called \"Jolnet,\" in the basement\r\nof his house.\r\n\r\nProphet, using the handle \"Robert Johnson,\" had obtained an account\r\non Richard Andrews' computer.  And there he stashed the E911 Document,\r\nby storing it in his own private section of Andrews' computer.\r\n\r\nWhy did Prophet do this?  If Prophet had eliminated the E911 Document\r\nfrom his own computer, and kept it hundreds of miles away, on another machine, under an\r\nalias, then he might have been fairly safe from discovery and prosecution--\r\nalthough his sneaky action had certainly put the unsuspecting Richard Andrews\r\nat risk.\r\n\r\nBut, like most hackers, Prophet was a pack-rat for illicit data.\r\nWhen it came to the crunch, he could not bear to part from his trophy.\r\nWhen Prophet's place in Decatur, Georgia was raided in July 1989,\r\nthere was the E911 Document, a smoking gun.  And there was Prophet\r\nin the hands of the Secret Service, doing his best to \"explain.\"\r\n\r\nOur story now takes us away from the Atlanta Three and their raids\r\nof the Summer of 1989.  We must leave Atlanta Three \"cooperating fully\"\r\nwith their numerous investigators.  And  all three of them did cooperate,\r\nas their Sentencing Memorandum from the US District Court of the\r\nNorthern Division of Georgia explained--just before all three of them\r\nwere sentenced to various federal prisons in November 1990.\r\n\r\nWe must now catch up on the other aspects of the war on the Legion of Doom.\r\nThe war on the Legion was a war on a network--in fact, a network of three\r\nnetworks, which intertwined and interrelated in a complex fashion.\r\nThe Legion itself, with Atlanta LoD, and their hanger-on Fry Guy,\r\nwere the first network.  The second network was Phrack magazine,\r\nwith its editors and contributors.\r\n\r\nThe third  network involved the electronic circle around a hacker\r\nknown as \"Terminus.\"\r\n\r\nThe war against these hacker networks was carried out by\r\na law enforcement network.  Atlanta LoD and Fry Guy\r\nwere pursued by USSS agents and federal prosecutors in Atlanta,\r\nIndiana, and Chicago.  \"Terminus\" found himself pursued by USSS\r\nand federal prosecutors from Baltimore and Chicago.  And the war\r\nagainst Phrack was almost entirely a Chicago operation.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of Terminus involved a great deal of energy,\r\nmostly from the Chicago Task Force, but it was to be the least-known\r\nand least-publicized of the Crackdown operations.  Terminus, who lived\r\nin Maryland, was a UNIX programmer and consultant, fairly well-known\r\n(under his given name) in the UNIX community, as an acknowledged expert\r\non AT&T minicomputers.  Terminus idolized AT&T, especially Bellcore,\r\nand longed for public recognition as a UNIX expert; his highest ambition\r\nwas to work for Bell Labs.\r\n\r\nBut Terminus had odd friends and a spotted history.\r\nTerminus had once been the subject of an admiring interview\r\nin Phrack (Volume II, Issue 14, Phile 2--dated May 1987).\r\nIn this article, Phrack co-editor Taran King described\r\n\"Terminus\" as an electronics engineer, 5'9\", brown-haired,\r\nborn in 1959--at 28 years old, quite mature for a hacker.\r\n\r\nTerminus had once been sysop of a phreak/hack underground board\r\ncalled \"MetroNet,\" which ran on an Apple II.  Later he'd replaced\r\n\"MetroNet\" with an underground board called \"MegaNet,\"\r\nspecializing in IBMs.  In his younger days, Terminus had written\r\none of the very first and most elegant code-scanning programs\r\nfor the IBM-PC.  This program had been widely distributed\r\nin the underground.  Uncounted legions of PC-owning phreaks and\r\nhackers had used Terminus's scanner program to rip-off telco codes.\r\nThis feat had not escaped the attention of telco security;\r\nit hardly could, since Terminus's earlier handle, \"Terminal Technician,\"\r\nwas proudly written right on the program.\r\n\r\nWhen he became a full-time computer professional\r\n(specializing in telecommunications programming),\r\nhe adopted the handle Terminus, meant to indicate that he\r\nhad \"reached the final point of being a proficient hacker.\"\r\nHe'd moved up to the UNIX-based \"Netsys\" board on an AT&T computer,\r\nwith four phone lines and an impressive 240 megs of storage.\r\n\"Netsys\" carried complete issues of Phrack, and Terminus was\r\nquite friendly with its publishers, Taran King and Knight Lightning.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1980s, Terminus had been a regular on Plovernet,\r\nPirate-80, Sherwood Forest and Shadowland, all well-known pirate boards,\r\nall heavily frequented by the Legion of Doom.  As it happened, Terminus\r\nwas never officially \"in LoD,\" because he'd never been given the official\r\nLoD high-sign and back-slap by Legion maven Lex Luthor.  Terminus had\r\nnever physically met anyone from LoD.  But that scarcely mattered much--\r\nthe Atlanta Three themselves had never been officially vetted by Lex, either.\r\n\r\nAs far as law enforcement was concerned, the issues were clear.\r\nTerminus was a full-time, adult computer professional\r\nwith particular skills at AT&T software and hardware--\r\nbut Terminus reeked of the Legion of Doom and the underground.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, 1990--half a month after the Martin Luther King Day Crash--\r\nUSSS agents Tim Foley from Chicago, and Jack Lewis from the Baltimore office,\r\naccompanied by AT&T security officer Jerry Dalton, travelled to Middle Town,\r\nMaryland.  There they grilled Terminus in his home (to the stark terror of\r\nhis wife and small children), and, in their customary fashion, hauled his\r\ncomputers out the door.\r\n\r\nThe Netsys machine proved to contain a plethora of arcane UNIX software--\r\nproprietary source code formally owned by AT&T.  Software such as:\r\nUNIX System Five Release 3.2; UNIX SV Release 3.1;  UUCP communications\r\nsoftware; KORN SHELL; RFS; IWB; WWB; DWB; the C++ programming language;\r\nPMON; TOOL CHEST; QUEST; DACT, and S FIND.\r\n\r\nIn the long-established piratical tradition of the underground,\r\nTerminus had been trading this illicitly-copied software with\r\na small circle of fellow UNIX programmers.  Very unwisely,\r\nhe had stored seven years of his electronic mail on his Netsys machine,\r\nwhich documented all the friendly arrangements he had made with\r\nhis various colleagues.\r\n\r\nTerminus had not crashed the AT&T phone system on January 15.\r\nHe was, however, blithely running a not-for-profit AT&T\r\nsoftware-piracy ring.  This was not an activity AT&T found amusing.\r\nAT&T security officer Jerry Dalton valued this \"stolen\" property\r\nat over three hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nAT&T's entry into the tussle of free enterprise had been complicated\r\nby the new, vague groundrules of the information economy.\r\nUntil the break-up of Ma Bell, AT&T was forbidden to sell\r\ncomputer hardware or software.  Ma Bell was the phone company;\r\nMa Bell was not allowed to use the enormous revenue from\r\ntelephone utilities, in order to finance any entry into\r\nthe computer market.\r\n\r\nAT&T nevertheless invented the UNIX operating system.\r\nAnd somehow AT&T managed to make UNIX a minor source of income.\r\nWeirdly, UNIX was not sold as computer software,\r\nbut actually retailed under an obscure regulatory\r\nexemption allowing sales of surplus equipment and scrap.\r\nAny bolder attempt to promote or retail UNIX would have\r\naroused angry legal opposition from computer companies.\r\nInstead, UNIX was licensed to universities, at modest rates,\r\nwhere the acids of academic freedom ate away steadily at AT&T's\r\nproprietary rights.\r\n\r\nCome the breakup, AT&T recognized that UNIX was a potential gold-mine.\r\nBy now, large chunks of UNIX code had been created that were not AT&T's,\r\nand were being sold by others.  An entire rival UNIX-based operating system\r\nhad arisen in Berkeley, California  (one of the world's great founts of\r\nideological hackerdom).  Today, \"hackers\" commonly consider \"Berkeley UNIX\"\r\nto be technically superior to AT&T's \"System V UNIX,\" but AT&T has not\r\nallowed mere technical elegance to intrude on the real-world business\r\nof marketing proprietary software.  AT&T has made its own code deliberately\r\nincompatible with other folks' UNIX, and has written code that it can prove\r\nis copyrightable, even if that code happens to be somewhat awkward--\"kludgey.\"\r\nAT&T UNIX user licenses are serious business agreements, replete with very\r\nclear copyright statements and non-disclosure clauses.\r\n\r\nAT&T has not exactly kept the UNIX cat in the bag,\r\nbut it kept a grip on its scruff with some success.\r\nBy the rampant, explosive standards of software piracy,\r\nAT&T UNIX source code is heavily copyrighted, well-guarded,\r\nwell-licensed.  UNIX was traditionally run only on\r\nmainframe machines, owned by large groups of suit-and-tie\r\nprofessionals, rather than on bedroom machines where\r\npeople can get up to easy mischief.\r\n\r\nAnd AT&T UNIX source code is serious high-level programming.\r\nThe number of skilled UNIX programmers with any actual motive\r\nto swipe UNIX source code is small.  It's tiny, compared to\r\nthe tens of thousands prepared to rip-off, say, entertaining\r\nPC games like \"Leisure Suit Larry.\"\r\n\r\nBut by 1989, the warez-d00d underground, in the persons of Terminus\r\nand his friends, was gnawing at AT&T UNIX.  And the property in question\r\nwas not sold for twenty bucks over the counter at the local branch of\r\nBabbage's or Egghead's;  this was massive, sophisticated, multi-line,\r\nmulti-author corporate code worth tens of thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nIt must be recognized at this point that Terminus's purported ring of UNIX\r\nsoftware pirates had not actually made any money from their suspected crimes.\r\nThe $300,000 dollar figure bandied about for the contents of Terminus's\r\ncomputer did not mean that Terminus was in actual illicit possession\r\nof three hundred thousand of AT&T's dollars.  Terminus was shipping\r\nsoftware back and forth, privately, person to person, for free.\r\nHe was not making a commercial business of piracy.  He hadn't\r\nasked for money; he didn't take money.  He lived quite modestly.\r\n\r\nAT&T employees--as well as freelance UNIX consultants, like Terminus--\r\ncommonly worked with \"proprietary\" AT&T software, both in the office\r\nand at home on their private machines.  AT&T rarely sent security officers\r\nout to comb the hard disks of its consultants.  Cheap freelance UNIX\r\ncontractors were quite useful to AT&T; they didn't have health insurance\r\nor retirement programs, much less union membership in the Communication\r\nWorkers of America.  They were humble digital drudges, wandering with mop\r\nand bucket through the Great Technological Temple of AT&T; but when the\r\nSecret Service arrived at their homes, it seemed they were eating with\r\ncompany silverware and sleeping on company sheets!  Outrageously, they\r\nbehaved as if the things they worked with every day belonged to them!\r\n\r\nAnd these were no mere hacker teenagers with their hands full\r\nof trash-paper and their noses pressed to the corporate windowpane.\r\nThese guys were UNIX wizards, not only carrying AT&T data in their\r\nmachines and their heads, but eagerly networking about it,\r\nover machines that were far more powerful than anything previously\r\nimagined in private hands.  How do you keep people disposable,\r\nyet assure their awestruck respect for your property?  It was a dilemma.\r\n\r\nMuch UNIX code was public-domain, available for free.  Much \"proprietary\"\r\nUNIX code had been extensively re-written, perhaps altered so much that it\r\nbecame an entirely new product--or perhaps not.  Intellectual property rights\r\nfor software developers were, and are, extraordinarily complex and confused.\r\nAnd software \"piracy,\" like the private copying of videos, is one of the most\r\nwidely practiced \"crimes\" in the world today.\r\n\r\nThe USSS were not experts in UNIX or familiar with the customs of its use.\r\nThe United States Secret Service, considered as a body, did not have one single\r\nperson in it who could program in a UNIX environment--no, not even one.\r\nThe Secret Service WERE making extensive use of expert help, but the \"experts\"\r\nthey had chosen were AT&T and Bellcore security officials, the very victims of\r\nthe purported crimes under investigation, the very people whose interest in\r\nAT&T's  \"proprietary\" software was most pronounced.\r\n\r\nOn February 6, 1990, Terminus was arrested by Agent Lewis.\r\nEventually, Terminus would be sent to prison for his illicit\r\nuse of a piece of AT&T software.\r\n\r\nThe issue of pirated AT&T software would bubble along in the background\r\nduring the war on the Legion of Doom.  Some half-dozen of Terminus's on-line\r\nacquaintances, including people in Illinois, Texas and California,\r\nwere grilled by the Secret Service in connection with the illicit\r\ncopying of software.  Except for Terminus, however, none were charged\r\nwith a crime.  None of them shared his peculiar prominence in the\r\nhacker underground.\r\n\r\nBut that did not mean that these people would, or could,\r\nstay out of trouble.  The transferral of illicit data in\r\ncyberspace is hazy and ill-defined business, with paradoxical\r\ndangers for everyone concerned:  hackers, signal carriers,\r\nboard owners, cops, prosecutors, even random passers-by.\r\nSometimes, well-meant attempts to avert trouble\r\nor punish wrongdoing bring more trouble than\r\nwould simple ignorance, indifference or impropriety.\r\n\r\nTerminus's \"Netsys\" board was not a common-or-garden\r\nbulletin board system, though it had most of the usual\r\nfunctions of a board.  Netsys was not a stand-alone machine,\r\nbut part of the globe-spanning \"UUCP\" cooperative network.\r\nThe UUCP network uses a set of Unix software programs called\r\n\"Unix-to-Unix Copy,\" which allows Unix systems to throw data to\r\none another at high speed through the public telephone network.\r\nUUCP is a radically decentralized, not-for-profit network of UNIX computers.\r\nThere are tens of thousands of these UNIX machines.  Some are small,\r\nbut many are powerful and also link to other networks.  UUCP has\r\ncertain arcane links to  major networks such as JANET, EasyNet, BITNET,\r\nJUNET, VNET, DASnet, PeaceNet and FidoNet, as well as the gigantic Internet.\r\n(The so-called \"Internet\" is not actually a network itself, but rather an\r\n\"internetwork\" connections standard that allows several globe-spanning\r\ncomputer networks to communicate with one another.  Readers fascinated\r\nby the weird and intricate tangles of modern computer networks may enjoy\r\nJohn S. Quarterman's authoritative 719-page explication, The Matrix,\r\nDigital Press, 1990.)\r\n\r\nA skilled user of Terminus' UNIX machine could send and receive\r\nelectronic mail from almost any major computer network in the world.\r\nNetsys was not called a \"board\" per se, but rather a \"node.\"\r\n\"Nodes\" were larger, faster, and more sophisticated than mere \"boards,\"\r\nand for hackers, to hang out on internationally-connected \"nodes\"\r\nwas quite the step up from merely hanging out on local \"boards.\"\r\n\r\nTerminus's Netsys node in Maryland had a number of direct\r\nlinks to other, similar UUCP nodes, run by people who shared his\r\ninterests and at least something of his free-wheeling attitude.\r\nOne of these nodes was Jolnet, owned by Richard Andrews, who,\r\nlike Terminus, was an independent UNIX consultant.\r\nJolnet also ran UNIX, and could be contacted at high speed\r\nby mainframe machines from all over the world.  Jolnet was\r\nquite a sophisticated piece of work, technically speaking,\r\nbut it was still run by an individual, as a private,\r\nnot-for-profit hobby.  Jolnet was mostly used by other\r\nUNIX programmers--for mail, storage, and access to networks.\r\nJolnet supplied access network access to about two hundred people,\r\nas well as a local junior college.\r\n\r\nAmong its various features and services, Jolnet also carried\r\nPhrack magazine.\r\n\r\nFor reasons of his own, Richard Andrews had become suspicious\r\nof a new user called  \"Robert Johnson.\"  Richard Andrews\r\ntook it upon himself to have a look at what \"Robert Johnson\"\r\nwas storing in Jolnet.  And Andrews found the E911 Document.\r\n\r\n\"Robert Johnson\" was the Prophet from the Legion of Doom,\r\nand the E911 Document was illicitly copied data from Prophet's\r\nraid on the BellSouth computers.\r\n\r\nThe E911 Document, a particularly illicit piece of digital property,\r\nwas about to resume its long, complex, and disastrous career.\r\n\r\nIt struck Andrews as fishy that someone not a telephone employee\r\nshould have a document referring to the \"Enhanced 911 System.\"\r\nBesides, the document itself bore an obvious warning.\r\n\r\n\"WARNING:  NOT FOR USE OR DISCLOSURE OUTSIDE BELLSOUTH\r\nOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES EXCEPT UNDER WRITTEN AGREEMENT.\"\r\n\r\nThese standard nondisclosure tags are often appended to all sorts\r\nof corporate material.  Telcos as a species are particularly notorious\r\nfor stamping most everything in sight as \"not for use or disclosure.\"\r\nStill, this particular piece of data was about the 911 System.\r\nThat sounded bad to Rich Andrews.\r\n\r\nAndrews was not prepared to ignore this sort of trouble.\r\nHe thought it would be wise to pass the document along\r\nto a friend and acquaintance on the UNIX network, for consultation.\r\nSo, around September 1988, Andrews sent yet another copy of the\r\nE911 Document electronically to an AT&T employee, one Charles Boykin,\r\nwho ran a UNIX-based node called \"attctc\" in Dallas, Texas.\r\n\r\n\"Attctc\" was the property of AT&T, and was run from AT&T's\r\nCustomer Technology Center in Dallas, hence the name \"attctc.\"\r\n\"Attctc\" was better-known as \"Killer,\" the name of the machine\r\nthat the system was running on.  \"Killer\" was a hefty, powerful,\r\nAT&T 3B2 500 model, a multi-user, multi-tasking UNIX platform\r\nwith 32 meg of memory and a mind-boggling 3.2 Gigabytes of storage.\r\nWhen  Killer had first arrived in Texas, in 1985, the 3B2 had been\r\none of AT&T's great white hopes for going head-to-head with IBM\r\nfor the corporate computer-hardware market.  \"Killer\" had been shipped\r\nto the Customer Technology Center in the Dallas Infomart, essentially\r\na high-technology mall, and there it sat, a demonstration model.\r\n\r\nCharles Boykin, a veteran AT&T hardware and digital communications expert,\r\nwas a local technical backup man for the AT&T 3B2 system.  As a display model\r\nin the Infomart mall, \"Killer\" had little to do, and it seemed a shame\r\nto waste the system's capacity.  So Boykin ingeniously wrote some UNIX\r\nbulletin-board software for \"Killer,\" and plugged the machine in to the\r\nlocal phone network.  \"Killer's\" debut in late 1985 made it the first\r\npublicly available UNIX site in the state of Texas.  Anyone who wanted to\r\nplay was welcome.\r\n\r\nThe machine immediately attracted an electronic community.\r\nIt joined the UUCP network, and offered network links\r\nto over eighty other computer sites, all of which became dependent\r\non Killer for their links to the greater world of cyberspace.\r\nAnd it wasn't just for the big guys; personal computer users\r\nalso stored freeware programs for the Amiga, the Apple,\r\nthe IBM and the Macintosh on Killer's vast 3,200 meg archives.\r\nAt one time, Killer had the largest library of public-domain\r\nMacintosh software in Texas.\r\n\r\nEventually, Killer attracted about 1,500 users,\r\nall busily communicating, uploading and downloading,\r\ngetting mail, gossipping, and linking to arcane\r\nand distant networks.\r\n\r\nBoykin received no pay for running Killer.  He considered\r\nit good publicity for the AT&T 3B2 system (whose sales were\r\nsomewhat less than stellar), but he also simply enjoyed\r\nthe vibrant community his skill had created.  He gave away\r\nthe bulletin-board UNIX software he had written, free of charge.\r\n\r\nIn the UNIX programming community, Charlie Boykin had the\r\nreputation of a warm, open-hearted, level-headed kind of guy.\r\nIn 1989, a group of Texan UNIX professionals voted Boykin\r\n\"System Administrator of the Year.\"  He was considered\r\na fellow you could trust for good advice.\r\n\r\nIn September 1988, without warning, the E911 Document\r\ncame plunging into Boykin's life, forwarded by Richard Andrews.\r\nBoykin immediately recognized that the Document was hot property.\r\nHe was not a voice-communications man, and knew little about\r\nthe ins and outs of the Baby Bells, but he certainly knew what\r\nthe 911 System was, and he was angry to see confidential data\r\nabout it in the hands of a nogoodnik.  This was clearly a\r\nmatter for telco security.  So, on September 21, 1988, Boykin\r\nmade yet ANOTHER copy of the E911 Document and passed this\r\none along to a professional acquaintance of his, one Jerome Dalton,\r\nfrom AT&T Corporate Information Security.  Jerry Dalton was the\r\nvery fellow who would later raid Terminus's house.\r\n\r\nFrom AT&T's security division, the E911 Document went to Bellcore.\r\n\r\nBellcore (or BELL COmmunications REsearch) had once been the central\r\nlaboratory of the Bell System.  Bell Labs employees had invented\r\nthe UNIX operating system.  Now Bellcore was a quasi-independent,\r\njointly owned company that acted as the research arm for all seven\r\nof the Baby Bell RBOCs.  Bellcore was in a good position to co-ordinate\r\nsecurity technology and consultation for the RBOCs, and the gentleman in\r\ncharge of this effort was Henry M. Kluepfel, a veteran of the Bell System\r\nwho had worked there for twenty-four years.\r\n\r\nOn October  13, 1988, Dalton passed the E911 Document to Henry Kluepfel.\r\nKluepfel, a veteran expert witness in telecommunications fraud and\r\ncomputer-fraud cases, had certainly seen worse trouble than this.\r\nHe recognized the document for what it was:  a trophy from a hacker break-in.\r\n\r\nHowever, whatever harm had been done in the intrusion was presumably old news.\r\nAt this point there seemed little to be done.  Kluepfel made a careful note\r\nof the circumstances and shelved the problem for the time being.\r\n\r\nWhole months passed.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1989 arrived.  The Atlanta Three were living it up\r\nin Bell South's switches, and had not yet met their comeuppance.\r\nThe Legion was thriving.  So was Phrack magazine.\r\nA good six months had passed since Prophet's AIMSX break-in.\r\nProphet, as hackers will, grew weary of sitting on his laurels.\r\n\"Knight Lightning\" and \"Taran King,\" the editors of Phrack,\r\nwere always begging Prophet for material they could publish.\r\nProphet decided that the heat must be off by this time,\r\nand that he could safely brag, boast, and strut.\r\n\r\nSo he sent a copy of the E911 Document--yet another one--\r\nfrom Rich Andrews' Jolnet machine to Knight Lightning's\r\nBITnet account at the University of Missouri.\r\nLet's review the fate of the document so far.\r\n\r\n0.  The original E911 Document.  This in the AIMSX system\r\non a mainframe computer in Atlanta, available to hundreds of people,\r\nbut all of them, presumably, BellSouth employees.  An unknown number\r\nof them may have their own copies of this document, but they are all\r\nprofessionals and all trusted by the phone company.\r\n\r\n1.  Prophet's illicit copy, at home on his own computer in Decatur, Georgia.\r\n\r\n2.  Prophet's back-up copy, stored on Rich Andrew's Jolnet machine\r\n    in the basement of Rich Andrews'  house near Joliet Illinois.\r\n\r\n3.  Charles Boykin's copy on \"Killer\" in Dallas, Texas,\r\n    sent by Rich Andrews from Joliet.\r\n\r\n4.  Jerry Dalton's copy at AT&T Corporate Information Security in New Jersey,\r\n    sent from Charles Boykin in Dallas.\r\n\r\n5.  Henry Kluepfel's copy at Bellcore security headquarters in New Jersey,\r\n    sent by Dalton.\r\n6.  Knight Lightning's copy, sent by Prophet from Rich Andrews' machine,\r\n    and now in Columbia, Missouri.\r\n\r\nWe can see that the \"security\" situation of this proprietary document,\r\nonce dug out of AIMSX, swiftly became bizarre.  Without any money\r\nchanging hands, without any particular special effort, this data\r\nhad been reproduced at least six times and had spread itself all over\r\nthe continent.  By far the worst, however, was yet to come.\r\n\r\nIn February 1989, Prophet and Knight Lightning bargained electronically\r\nover the fate of this trophy.  Prophet wanted to boast, but, at the same time,\r\nscarcely wanted to be caught.\r\n\r\nFor his part, Knight Lightning was eager to publish as much of the document\r\nas he could manage.  Knight Lightning was a fledgling political-science major\r\nwith a particular interest in freedom-of-information issues.  He would gladly\r\npublish most anything that would reflect glory on the prowess of the\r\nunderground and embarrass the telcos.  However, Knight Lightning himself\r\nhad contacts in telco security, and sometimes consulted them on material\r\nhe'd received that might be too dicey for publication.\r\n\r\nProphet and  Knight Lightning decided to edit the E911 Document\r\nso as to delete most of its identifying traits.  First of all,\r\nits large \"NOT FOR USE OR DISCLOSURE\" warning had to go.\r\nThen there were other matters.  For instance, it listed\r\nthe office telephone numbers of several BellSouth 911\r\nspecialists in Florida.  If these phone numbers were\r\npublished in Phrack, the BellSouth employees involved\r\nwould very likely be hassled by phone phreaks,\r\nwhich would anger BellSouth no end, and pose a\r\ndefinite operational hazard for both Prophet and Phrack.\r\n\r\nSo Knight Lightning cut the Document almost in half,\r\nremoving the phone numbers and some of the touchier\r\nand more specific information.  He passed it back\r\nelectronically to Prophet;  Prophet was still nervous,\r\nso Knight Lightning cut a bit more.  They finally agreed\r\nthat it was ready to go, and that it would be published\r\nin Phrack under the pseudonym, \"The Eavesdropper.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was done on February 25, 1989.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-fourth issue of Phrack  featured a chatty interview\r\nwith co-ed phone-phreak \"Chanda Leir,\" three articles on BITNET\r\nand its links to other computer networks, an article on 800 and 900\r\nnumbers by \"Unknown User,\" \"VaxCat's\" article on telco basics\r\n(slyly entitled \"Lifting Ma Bell's Veil of Secrecy,)\" and\r\nthe usual \"Phrack World News.\"\r\n\r\nThe News section, with painful irony, featured an extended account\r\nof the sentencing of \"Shadowhawk,\" an eighteen-year-old Chicago hacker\r\nwho had just been put in federal prison by William J. Cook himself.\r\n\r\nAnd then there were the two articles by \"The Eavesdropper.\"\r\nThe first was the edited E911 Document, now titled\r\n\"Control Office Administration Of Enhanced 911 Services\r\nfor Special Services and Major Account Centers.\"\r\nEavesdropper's second article was a glossary of terms\r\nexplaining the blizzard of telco acronyms and buzzwords\r\nin the E911 Document.\r\n\r\nThe hapless document was now distributed, in the usual Phrack routine,\r\nto a good one hundred and fifty sites.  Not a hundred and fifty PEOPLE,\r\nmind you--a hundred and fifty SITES, some of these sites linked to UNIX\r\nnodes or bulletin board systems, which themselves had readerships of tens,\r\ndozens, even hundreds of people.\r\n\r\nThis was February 1989.  Nothing happened immediately.\r\nSummer came, and the Atlanta crew were raided by the Secret Service.\r\nFry Guy was apprehended.  Still nothing whatever happened to Phrack.\r\nSix more issues of Phrack came out, 30 in all, more or less on\r\na monthly schedule.  Knight Lightning and co-editor Taran King\r\nwent untouched.\r\n\r\nPhrack tended to duck and cover whenever the heat came down.\r\nDuring the summer busts of 1987--(hacker busts tended to cluster in summer,\r\nperhaps because hackers were easier to find at home than in college)--\r\nPhrack had ceased publication for several months, and laid low.\r\nSeveral LoD hangers-on had been arrested, but nothing had happened\r\nto the Phrack crew, the premiere gossips of the underground.\r\nIn 1988, Phrack had been taken over by a new editor,\r\n\"Crimson Death,\" a raucous youngster with a taste for anarchy files.\r\n1989, however, looked like a bounty year for the underground.\r\nKnight Lightning and his co-editor Taran King took up the reins again,\r\nand Phrack flourished throughout 1989.  Atlanta LoD went down hard in\r\nthe summer of 1989, but Phrack rolled merrily on.  Prophet's E911 Document\r\nseemed unlikely to cause Phrack any trouble.  By January 1990,\r\nit had been available in Phrack for almost a year.  Kluepfel and Dalton,\r\nofficers of Bellcore and AT&T  security, had possessed the document\r\nfor sixteen months--in fact, they'd had it even before Knight Lightning\r\nhimself, and had done nothing in particular to stop its distribution.\r\nThey hadn't even told Rich Andrews or Charles Boykin to erase the copies\r\nfrom their UNIX nodes, Jolnet and Killer.\r\n\r\nBut then came the monster Martin Luther King Day Crash of January 15, 1990.\r\n\r\nA flat three days later, on January 18, four agents showed up\r\nat Knight Lightning's fraternity house.  One was Timothy Foley,\r\nthe second Barbara Golden, both of them Secret Service agents\r\nfrom the Chicago office.  Also along was a University of Missouri\r\nsecurity officer, and Reed Newlin, a security man from Southwestern Bell,\r\nthe RBOC having jurisdiction over Missouri.\r\n\r\nFoley accused Knight Lightning of causing the nationwide crash\r\nof the phone system.\r\n\r\nKnight Lightning was aghast at this allegation.  On the face of it,\r\nthe suspicion was not entirely implausible--though Knight Lightning\r\nknew that he himself hadn't done it.  Plenty of hot-dog hackers\r\nhad bragged that they could crash the phone system, however.\r\n\"Shadowhawk,\" for instance, the Chicago hacker whom William Cook\r\nhad recently put in jail, had several times boasted on boards\r\nthat he could \"shut down AT&T's public switched network.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now this event, or something that looked just like it,\r\nhad actually taken place.  The Crash had lit a fire under\r\nthe Chicago Task Force.  And the former fence-sitters at\r\nBellcore and AT&T were now ready to roll.  The consensus\r\namong telco security--already horrified by the skill of\r\nthe BellSouth intruders --was that the digital underground\r\nwas out of hand.  LoD and Phrack must go.  And in publishing\r\nProphet's E911 Document, Phrack had provided law enforcement\r\nwith what appeared to be a powerful legal weapon.\r\n\r\nFoley confronted Knight Lightning about the  E911 Document.\r\n\r\nKnight Lightning was cowed.  He immediately began \"cooperating fully\"\r\nin the usual tradition of the digital underground.\r\n\r\nHe gave Foley a complete run of Phrack, printed out in a set\r\nof three-ring binders.  He handed over his electronic mailing list\r\nof Phrack subscribers.  Knight Lightning was grilled for four hours\r\nby Foley and his cohorts.  Knight Lightning admitted that Prophet\r\nhad passed him the E911 Document, and he admitted that he had known\r\nit was stolen booty from a hacker raid on a telephone company.\r\nKnight Lightning signed a statement to this effect, and agreed,\r\nin writing, to cooperate with investigators.\r\n\r\nNext day--January 19, 1990, a Friday --the Secret Service returned\r\nwith a search warrant, and thoroughly searched Knight Lightning's\r\nupstairs room in the fraternity house.  They took all his floppy disks,\r\nthough, interestingly, they left Knight Lightning in possession\r\nof both his computer and his modem.  (The computer had no hard disk,\r\nand in Foley's judgement was not a store of evidence.)  But this was a\r\nvery minor bright spot among Knight Lightning's rapidly multiplying troubles.\r\nBy this time, Knight Lightning was in plenty of hot water, not only with\r\nfederal police, prosecutors, telco investigators, and university security,\r\nbut with the elders of his own campus fraternity, who were outraged\r\nto think that they had been unwittingly harboring a federal computer-criminal.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Knight Lightning was summoned to Chicago, where he was\r\nfurther grilled by Foley and USSS veteran agent Barbara Golden, this time\r\nwith an attorney present.  And on Tuesday, he was formally indicted\r\nby a federal grand jury.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Knight Lightning, which occurred on July 24-27, 1990,\r\nwas the crucial show-trial of the Hacker Crackdown.  We will examine\r\nthe trial at some length in Part Four of this book.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we must continue our dogged pursuit of the E911 Document.\r\n\r\nIt must have been clear by January 1990 that the E911 Document,\r\nin the form Phrack had published it back in February 1989,\r\nhad gone off at the speed of light in at least a hundred\r\nand fifty different directions.  To attempt to put this\r\nelectronic genie back in the bottle was flatly impossible.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the E911 Document was STILL stolen property,\r\nformally and legally speaking.  Any electronic transference\r\nof this document, by anyone unauthorized to have it,\r\ncould be interpreted as an act of wire fraud.  Interstate\r\ntransfer of stolen property, including electronic property,\r\nwas a federal crime.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force had been assured\r\nthat the E911 Document was worth a hefty sum of money.  In fact,\r\nthey had a precise estimate of its worth from BellSouth security personnel:\r\n$79,449.  A sum of this scale seemed to warrant vigorous prosecution.\r\nEven if the damage could not be undone, at least this large sum\r\noffered a good legal pretext for stern punishment of the thieves.\r\nIt seemed likely to impress judges and juries. And it could be used\r\nin court to mop up the Legion of Doom.\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta crowd was already in the bag, by the time\r\nthe Chicago Task Force had gotten around to Phrack.\r\nBut the Legion was a hydra-headed thing.  In late 89,\r\na brand-new Legion of Doom board, \"Phoenix Project,\"\r\nhad gone up in Austin, Texas.  Phoenix Project was sysoped\r\nby no less a man than the Mentor himself, ably assisted by\r\nUniversity of Texas student and hardened Doomster \"Erik Bloodaxe.\"\r\n\r\nAs we have seen from his Phrack manifesto, the Mentor was a hacker\r\nzealot who regarded computer intrusion as something close to a moral duty.\r\nPhoenix Project was an ambitious effort, intended to revive the digital\r\nunderground to what Mentor considered the full flower of the early 80s.\r\nThe Phoenix board would also boldly bring elite hackers face-to-face\r\nwith the telco \"opposition.\"  On \"Phoenix,\" America's cleverest hackers\r\nwould supposedly shame the telco squareheads out of their stick-in-the-mud\r\nattitudes, and perhaps convince them that the Legion of Doom elite were really\r\nan all-right crew.  The  premiere of \"Phoenix Project\" was heavily trumpeted\r\nby Phrack,and \"Phoenix Project\" carried a complete run of Phrack issues,\r\nincluding the E911 Document as Phrack had published it.\r\n\r\nPhoenix Project was only one of many--possibly hundreds--of nodes and boards\r\nall over America that were in guilty possession of the E911 Document.\r\nBut Phoenix was an outright, unashamed Legion of Doom board.\r\nUnder Mentor's guidance, it was flaunting itself in the face\r\nof telco security personnel.  Worse yet, it was actively trying\r\nto WIN THEM OVER as sympathizers for the digital underground elite.\r\n\"Phoenix\" had no cards or codes on it.  Its hacker elite considered\r\nPhoenix at least technically legal.  But Phoenix was a corrupting influence,\r\nwhere hacker anarchy was eating away like digital acid at the underbelly\r\nof corporate propriety.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force now prepared\r\nto descend upon Austin, Texas.\r\n\r\nOddly, not one but TWO trails of the Task Force's investigation led\r\ntoward Austin.  The city of Austin, like Atlanta, had made itself\r\na bulwark of the Sunbelt's Information Age, with a strong university\r\nresearch presence, and a number of cutting-edge electronics companies,\r\nincluding Motorola, Dell, CompuAdd, IBM, Sematech and MCC.\r\n\r\nWhere computing machinery went, hackers generally followed.\r\nAustin boasted not only \"Phoenix Project,\" currently LoD's\r\nmost flagrant underground board, but a number of UNIX  nodes.\r\n\r\nOne of these nodes was \"Elephant,\" run by a UNIX consultant\r\nnamed Robert Izenberg.  Izenberg, in search of a relaxed Southern\r\nlifestyle and a lowered cost-of-living, had recently migrated\r\nto Austin from New Jersey.  In New Jersey, Izenberg had worked\r\nfor an independent contracting company, programming UNIX code for\r\nAT&T itself.  \"Terminus\" had been a frequent user on Izenberg's\r\nprivately owned Elephant node.\r\n\r\nHaving interviewed Terminus and examined the records on Netsys,\r\nthe Chicago Task Force were now convinced that they had discovered\r\nan underground gang of UNIX software pirates, who were demonstrably\r\nguilty of interstate trafficking in illicitly copied AT&T source code.\r\nIzenberg was swept into the dragnet around Terminus, the self-proclaimed\r\nultimate UNIX hacker.\r\n\r\nIzenberg, in Austin, had settled down into a UNIX job\r\nwith a Texan branch of IBM.  Izenberg was no longer\r\nworking as a contractor for AT&T, but he had friends\r\nin New Jersey, and he still logged on to AT&T UNIX\r\ncomputers back in New Jersey, more or less whenever\r\nit pleased him.  Izenberg's activities appeared highly\r\nsuspicious to the Task Force.  Izenberg might well be\r\nbreaking into AT&T computers, swiping AT&T software,\r\nand passing it to  Terminus and other possible confederates,\r\nthrough the UNIX node network.  And this data was worth,\r\nnot merely $79,499, but hundreds of thousands of dollars!\r\n\r\nOn February 21, 1990, Robert Izenberg arrived home\r\nfrom work at IBM to find that all the computers\r\nhad mysteriously vanished from his Austin apartment.\r\nNaturally he assumed that he had been robbed.\r\nHis \"Elephant\" node, his other machines, his notebooks,\r\nhis disks, his tapes, all gone!  However, nothing much\r\nelse seemed disturbed--the place had not been ransacked.\r\nThe puzzle becaming much stranger some five minutes later.\r\nAustin U. S. Secret Service Agent Al Soliz, accompanied by\r\nUniversity of Texas campus-security officer Larry Coutorie\r\nand the ubiquitous Tim Foley, made their appearance at Izenberg's door.\r\nThey were in plain clothes: slacks, polo shirts.  They came in,\r\nand Tim Foley accused Izenberg of belonging to the Legion of Doom.\r\n\r\nIzenberg told them that he had never heard of the \"Legion of Doom.\"\r\nAnd what about a certain stolen E911 Document, that posed a direct\r\nthreat to the police emergency lines?  Izenberg claimed that he'd\r\nnever heard of that, either.\r\n\r\nHis interrogators found this difficult to believe.\r\nDidn't he know Terminus?\r\n\r\nWho?\r\n\r\nThey gave him Terminus's real name.  Oh yes, said Izenberg.\r\nHe knew THAT guy all right--he was leading discussions\r\non the Internet about AT&T computers, especially the AT&T 3B2.\r\n\r\nAT&T had thrust this machine into the marketplace,\r\nbut, like many of AT&T's ambitious attempts to enter\r\nthe computing arena, the 3B2 project had something less\r\nthan a glittering success.  Izenberg himself had been\r\na contractor for the division of AT&T that supported the 3B2.\r\nThe entire division had been shut down.\r\n\r\nNowadays, the cheapest and quickest way to get help with this\r\nfractious piece of machinery was to join one of Terminus's\r\ndiscussion groups on the Internet, where friendly and knowledgeable\r\nhackers would help you for free.  Naturally the remarks within this\r\ngroup were less than flattering about the Death Star. . .was\r\nTHAT the problem?\r\n\r\nFoley told Izenberg that Terminus had been acquiring hot software\r\nthrough his, Izenberg's, machine.\r\n\r\nIzenberg shrugged this off.  A good eight megabytes of data flowed\r\nthrough his UUCP site every day.  UUCP nodes spewed data like fire hoses.\r\nElephant had been directly linked to Netsys--not surprising, since Terminus\r\nwas a 3B2 expert and Izenberg had been a 3B2 contractor.\r\nIzenberg was also linked to \"attctc\" and the University of Texas.\r\nTerminus was a well-known UNIX expert, and might have been up to\r\nall manner of hijinks on Elephant.  Nothing Izenberg could do about that.\r\nThat was physically impossible.  Needle in a haystack.\r\n\r\nIn a four-hour grilling, Foley urged Izenberg to come clean\r\nand admit that he was in conspiracy with Terminus,\r\nand a member of the Legion of Doom.\r\n\r\nIzenberg denied this.  He was no weirdo teenage hacker--\r\nhe was thirty-two years old, and didn't even have a \"handle.\"\r\nIzenberg was a former TV technician and electronics specialist\r\nwho had drifted into UNIX consulting as a full-grown adult.\r\nIzenberg had never met Terminus, physically.  He'd once bought\r\na cheap high-speed modem from him, though.\r\n\r\nFoley told him that this modem (a Telenet T2500 which ran at 19.2 kilobaud,\r\nand which had just gone out Izenberg's door in Secret Service custody)\r\nwas likely hot property.  Izenberg was taken aback to hear this; but then\r\nagain, most of Izenberg's equipment, like that of most freelance professionals\r\nin the industry, was discounted, passed hand-to-hand through various kinds\r\nof barter and gray-market.  There was no proof that the modem was stolen,\r\nand even if it were, Izenberg hardly saw how that gave them the right\r\nto take every electronic item in his house.\r\n\r\nStill, if the United States Secret Service figured they needed\r\nhis computer for national security reasons--or whatever--\r\nthen Izenberg would not kick.  He figured he would somehow\r\nmake the sacrifice of his twenty thousand dollars' worth\r\nof professional equipment, in the spirit of full cooperation\r\nand good citizenship.\r\n\r\nRobert Izenberg was not arrested.  Izenberg was not charged with any crime.\r\nHis UUCP node--full of some 140 megabytes of the files, mail, and data\r\nof himself and his dozen or so entirely innocent users--went out the door\r\nas \"evidence.\"  Along with the disks and tapes, Izenberg had lost about\r\n800 megabytes of data.\r\n\r\nSix months would pass before Izenberg decided to phone the Secret Service\r\nand ask how the case was going.  That was the first time that Robert Izenberg\r\nwould ever hear the name of William Cook.  As of January 1992, a full\r\ntwo years after the seizure, Izenberg, still not charged with any crime,\r\nwould be struggling through the morass of the courts, in hope of recovering\r\nhis thousands of dollars' worth of seized equipment.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Izenberg case received absolutely no press coverage.\r\nThe Secret Service had walked into an Austin home, removed a UNIX bulletin-\r\nboard system, and met with no operational difficulties whatsoever.\r\n\r\nExcept that word of a crackdown had percolated through the Legion of Doom.\r\n\"The Mentor\" voluntarily shut down \"The Phoenix Project.\"  It seemed a pity,\r\nespecially as telco security employees had, in fact, shown up on Phoenix,\r\njust as he had hoped--along with the usual motley crowd of LoD heavies,\r\nhangers-on, phreaks, hackers and wannabes.  There was \"Sandy\" Sandquist from\r\nUS SPRINT security, and some guy named Henry Kluepfel, from Bellcore itself!\r\nKluepfel had been trading friendly banter with hackers on Phoenix since\r\nJanuary 30th (two weeks after the Martin Luther King Day Crash).\r\nThe presence of such a stellar telco official seemed quite the coup\r\nfor Phoenix Project.\r\n\r\nStill, Mentor could judge the climate.  Atlanta in ruins,\r\nPhrack in deep trouble, something weird going on with UNIX nodes--\r\ndiscretion was advisable.  Phoenix Project went off-line.\r\n\r\nKluepfel, of course, had been monitoring this LoD bulletin\r\nboard for his own purposes--and those of the Chicago unit.\r\nAs far back as June 1987, Kluepfel had logged on to a Texas\r\nunderground board called \"Phreak Klass 2600.\"  There he'd\r\ndiscovered an Chicago youngster named \"Shadowhawk,\"\r\nstrutting and boasting about rifling AT&T computer files,\r\nand bragging of his ambitions to riddle AT&T's Bellcore\r\ncomputers with trojan horse programs.  Kluepfel had passed\r\nthe news to Cook in Chicago, Shadowhawk's computers\r\nhad gone out the door in Secret Service custody,\r\nand Shadowhawk himself had gone to jail.\r\n\r\nNow it was Phoenix Project's turn.  Phoenix Project postured\r\nabout \"legality\" and \"merely intellectual interest,\" but it reeked\r\nof the underground.  It had Phrack on it.  It had the E911 Document.\r\nIt had a lot of dicey talk about breaking into systems, including some\r\nbold and reckless stuff about a supposed \"decryption service\" that Mentor\r\nand friends were planning to run, to help crack encrypted passwords off\r\nof hacked systems.\r\n\r\nMentor was an adult.  There was a  bulletin board at his place of work,\r\nas well.  Kleupfel logged onto this board, too, and discovered it to be\r\ncalled \"Illuminati.\"  It was run by some company called Steve Jackson Games.\r\n\r\nOn  March 1, 1990, the Austin crackdown went into high gear.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 1--a Thursday--21-year-old University of Texas\r\nstudent \"Erik Bloodaxe,\" co-sysop of Phoenix Project and an avowed member\r\nof the Legion of Doom, was wakened by a police revolver levelled at his head.\r\n\r\nBloodaxe watched, jittery, as Secret Service agents\r\nappropriated his 300 baud terminal and, rifling his files,\r\ndiscovered his treasured source-code for Robert Morris's\r\nnotorious Internet Worm.  But Bloodaxe, a wily operator,\r\nhad suspected that something of the like might be coming.\r\nAll his best equipment had been hidden away elsewhere.\r\nThe raiders took everything electronic, however,\r\nincluding his telephone.  They were stymied by his\r\nhefty arcade-style Pac-Man game, and left it in place,\r\nas it was simply too heavy to move.\r\n\r\nBloodaxe was not arrested.  He was not charged with any crime.\r\nA good two years later, the police still had what they had\r\ntaken from him, however.\r\n\r\nThe Mentor was less wary.  The dawn raid rousted him and his wife\r\nfrom bed in their underwear, and six Secret Service agents,\r\naccompanied by an Austin policeman and Henry Kluepfel himself,\r\nmade a rich haul.  Off went the works, into the agents' white\r\nChevrolet minivan:  an IBM PC-AT clone with 4 meg of RAM and\r\na 120-meg hard disk; a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet II printer;\r\na completely legitimate and highly expensive SCO-Xenix 286\r\noperating system; Pagemaker disks and documentation;\r\nand the Microsoft Word word-processing program.  Mentor's wife\r\nhad her incomplete academic thesis stored on the hard-disk;\r\nthat went, too, and so did the couple's telephone.  As of two years later,\r\nall this property remained in police custody.\r\n\r\nMentor remained under guard in his apartment as agents prepared\r\nto raid Steve Jackson Games.  The fact that this was a business\r\nheadquarters and not a private residence did not deter the agents.\r\nIt was still very early; no one was at work yet.  The agents prepared\r\nto break down the door, but Mentor, eavesdropping on the Secret Service\r\nwalkie-talkie traffic, begged them not to do it, and offered his key\r\nto the building.\r\n\r\nThe exact details of the next events are unclear.  The agents\r\nwould not let anyone else into the building.  Their search warrant,\r\nwhen produced, was unsigned.  Apparently they breakfasted from the local\r\n\"Whataburger,\" as the litter from hamburgers was later found inside.\r\nThey also extensively sampled a bag of jellybeans kept by an SJG employee.\r\nSomeone tore a \"Dukakis for President\" sticker from the wall.\r\n\r\nSJG employees, diligently showing up for the day's work, were met\r\nat the door and briefly questioned by U.S. Secret Service agents.\r\nThe employees watched in astonishment as agents wielding crowbars\r\nand screwdrivers emerged with captive machines.  They attacked\r\noutdoor storage units with boltcutters.  The agents wore\r\nblue nylon windbreakers with \"SECRET SERVICE\" stencilled\r\nacross the back, with running-shoes and jeans.\r\n\r\nJackson's company lost three computers, several hard-disks,\r\nhundred of floppy disks, two monitors, three modems,\r\na laser printer, various powercords, cables, and adapters\r\n(and, oddly, a small bag of screws, bolts and nuts).\r\nThe seizure of Illuminati BBS deprived SJG of all the programs,\r\ntext files, and private e-mail on the board.  The loss of two other\r\nSJG computers was a severe blow as well, since it caused the loss\r\nof electronically stored contracts, financial projections,\r\naddress directories, mailing lists, personnel files,\r\nbusiness correspondence, and, not least, the drafts\r\nof forthcoming games and gaming books.\r\n\r\nNo one at Steve Jackson Games was arrested.  No one was accused\r\nof any crime.  No charges were filed.  Everything appropriated\r\nwas officially kept as \"evidence\" of crimes never specified.\r\n\r\nAfter the Phrack show-trial, the Steve Jackson Games scandal\r\nwas the most bizarre and aggravating incident of the Hacker\r\nCrackdown of 1990.  This raid by the Chicago Task Force\r\non a science-fiction gaming publisher was to rouse a\r\nswarming host of civil liberties issues, and gave rise\r\nto an enduring controversy that was still re-complicating itself,\r\nand growing in the scope of its implications, a full two years later.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of the E911 Document stopped with the Steve Jackson Games raid.\r\nAs we have seen, there were hundreds, perhaps thousands of computer users\r\nin America with the E911 Document in their possession.  Theoretically,\r\nChicago had a perfect legal right to raid any of these people,\r\nand could have legally seized the machines of anybody who subscribed to Phrack.\r\nHowever, there was no copy of the E911 Document on Jackson's Illuminati board.\r\nAnd there the Chicago raiders stopped dead; they have not raided anyone since.\r\n\r\nIt might be assumed that Rich Andrews and Charlie Boykin, who had brought\r\nthe E911 Document to the attention of telco security, might be spared\r\nany official suspicion.  But as we have seen, the willingness to\r\n\"cooperate fully\" offers little, if any, assurance against federal\r\nanti-hacker prosecution.\r\n\r\nRichard Andrews found himself in deep trouble, thanks to the E911 Document.\r\nAndrews lived in Illinois, the native stomping grounds of the Chicago\r\nTask Force.  On February 3 and 6, both his home and his place of work\r\nwere raided by USSS.  His machines went out the door, too, and he was\r\ngrilled at length (though not arrested).  Andrews proved to be in\r\npurportedly guilty possession of: UNIX SVR 3.2; UNIX SVR 3.1; UUCP;\r\nPMON; WWB; IWB; DWB; NROFF; KORN SHELL '88; C++; and QUEST,\r\namong other items.  Andrews had received this proprietary code--\r\nwhich AT&T officially valued at well over $250,000--through the\r\nUNIX network, much of it supplied to him as a personal favor by Terminus.\r\nPerhaps worse yet, Andrews admitted to returning the favor, by passing\r\nTerminus a copy of AT&T proprietary STARLAN source code.\r\n\r\nEven Charles Boykin, himself an AT&T employee, entered some very hot water.\r\nBy 1990, he'd almost forgotten about the E911 problem he'd reported in\r\nSeptember 88; in fact, since that date, he'd passed two more security alerts\r\nto Jerry Dalton, concerning matters that Boykin considered far worse than\r\nthe E911 Document.\r\n\r\nBut by 1990, year of the crackdown, AT&T Corporate Information Security\r\nwas fed up with \"Killer.\"  This machine offered no direct income to AT&T,\r\nand was providing aid and comfort to a cloud of suspicious yokels\r\nfrom outside the company, some of them actively malicious toward AT&T,\r\nits property, and its corporate interests.  Whatever goodwill and publicity\r\nhad been won among Killer's 1,500 devoted users was considered no longer\r\nworth the security risk.  On February 20, 1990, Jerry Dalton arrived in\r\nDallas and simply unplugged the phone jacks, to the puzzled alarm\r\nof Killer's many Texan users.  Killer went permanently off-line,\r\nwith the loss of vast archives of programs and huge quantities\r\nof electronic mail; it was never restored to service.  AT&T showed\r\nno particular regard for the \"property\" of these 1,500 people.\r\nWhatever \"property\" the users had been storing on AT&T's computer\r\nsimply vanished completely.\r\n\r\nBoykin, who had himself reported the E911 problem,\r\nnow found himself under a cloud of suspicion.  In a weird\r\nprivate-security replay of the Secret Service seizures,\r\nBoykin's own home was visited by AT&T Security and his\r\nown machines were carried out the door.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were marked special features in the Boykin case.\r\nBoykin's disks and his personal computers were swiftly examined\r\nby his corporate employers and returned politely in just two days--\r\n(unlike Secret Service seizures, which commonly take months or years).\r\nBoykin was not charged with any crime or wrongdoing, and he kept his job\r\nwith AT&T (though he did retire from AT&T in September 1991,\r\nat the age of 52).\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to note that the US Secret Service somehow failed\r\nto seize Boykin's \"Killer\" node and carry AT&T's own computer out the door.\r\nNor did they raid Boykin's home.  They seemed perfectly willing to take the\r\nword of AT&T Security that AT&T's employee, and AT&T's \"Killer\" node,\r\nwere free of hacker contraband and on the up-and-up.\r\n\r\nIt's digital water-under-the-bridge at this point, as Killer's\r\n3,200 megabytes of Texan electronic community were erased in 1990,\r\nand \"Killer\" itself was shipped out of the state.\r\n\r\nBut the experiences of Andrews and Boykin, and the users of their systems,\r\nremained side issues.  They did not begin to assume the social, political,\r\nand legal importance that gathered, slowly but inexorably, around the issue\r\nof the raid on Steve Jackson Games.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nWe must now turn our attention to Steve Jackson Games itself,\r\nand explain what SJG was, what it really did, and how it had\r\nmanaged to attract this particularly odd and virulent kind of trouble.\r\nThe reader may recall that this is not the first but the second time\r\nthat the company has appeared in this narrative; a Steve Jackson game\r\ncalled GURPS was a favorite pastime of Atlanta hacker Urvile,\r\nand Urvile's science-fictional gaming notes had been mixed up\r\npromiscuously with notes about his actual computer intrusions.\r\n\r\nFirst, Steve Jackson Games, Inc., was NOT a publisher of \"computer games.\"\r\nSJG published \"simulation games,\" parlor games that were played on paper,\r\nwith pencils, and dice, and printed guidebooks full of rules and\r\nstatistics tables.  There were no computers involved in the games themselves.\r\nWhen you bought a Steve Jackson Game, you did not receive any software disks.\r\nWhat you got was a plastic bag with some cardboard game tokens,\r\nmaybe a few maps or a deck of cards.  Most of their products were books.\r\n\r\nHowever, computers WERE deeply involved in the Steve Jackson Games business.\r\nLike almost all modern publishers, Steve Jackson and his fifteen employees\r\nused computers to write text, to keep accounts, and to run the business\r\ngenerally.  They also used a computer to run their official bulletin board\r\nsystem for Steve Jackson Games, a board called Illuminati.  On Illuminati,\r\nsimulation gamers who happened to own computers and modems could associate,\r\ntrade mail, debate the theory and practice of gaming, and keep up with the\r\ncompany's news and its product announcements.\r\n\r\nIlluminati was a modestly popular board, run on a small computer\r\nwith limited storage, only one phone-line, and no ties to large-scale\r\ncomputer networks.  It did, however, have hundreds of users,\r\nmany of them dedicated gamers willing to call from out-of-state.\r\n\r\nIlluminati was NOT an \"underground\" board.  It did not feature hints\r\non computer intrusion, or \"anarchy files,\" or illicitly posted\r\ncredit card numbers, or long-distance access codes.\r\nSome of Illuminati's users, however, were members of the Legion of Doom.\r\nAnd so was one of Steve Jackson's senior employees--the Mentor.\r\nThe Mentor wrote for Phrack, and also ran an underground board,\r\nPhoenix Project--but the Mentor was not a computer professional.\r\nThe Mentor was the managing editor of Steve Jackson Games and\r\na professional game designer by trade.  These LoD members did not\r\nuse Illuminati to help their HACKING activities.  They used it to\r\nhelp their GAME-PLAYING activities--and they were even more dedicated\r\nto simulation gaming than they were to hacking.\r\n\r\n\"Illuminati\" got its name from a card-game that Steve Jackson himself,\r\nthe company's founder and sole owner, had invented.  This multi-player\r\ncard-game was one of Mr Jackson's best-known, most successful,\r\nmost technically innovative products.  \"Illuminati\" was a game\r\nof paranoiac conspiracy in which various antisocial cults warred\r\ncovertly to dominate the world.  \"Illuminati\" was hilarious,\r\nand great fun to play, involving flying saucers, the CIA, the KGB,\r\nthe phone companies, the Ku Klux Klan, the South American Nazis,\r\nthe cocaine cartels, the Boy Scouts, and dozens of other splinter groups\r\nfrom the twisted depths of Mr. Jackson's professionally fervid imagination.\r\nFor the uninitiated, any public discussion of the \"Illuminati\" card-game\r\nsounded, by turns, utterly menacing or completely insane.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was SJG's \"Car Wars,\" in which souped-up armored hot-rods\r\nwith rocket-launchers and heavy machine-guns did battle on the American\r\nhighways of the future.  The lively Car Wars discussion on the Illuminati\r\nboard featured many meticulous, painstaking discussions of the effects\r\nof grenades, land-mines, flamethrowers and napalm.  It sounded like\r\nhacker anarchy files run amuck.\r\n\r\nMr Jackson and his co-workers earned their daily bread by supplying people\r\nwith make-believe adventures and weird ideas.  The more far-out, the better.\r\n\r\nSimulation gaming is an unusual pastime, but gamers have not\r\ngenerally had to beg the permission of the Secret Service to exist.\r\nWargames and role-playing adventures are an old and honored pastime,\r\nmuch favored by professional military strategists.  Once little-known,\r\nthese games are now played by hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts\r\nthroughout North America, Europe and Japan.  Gaming-books, once restricted\r\nto hobby outlets, now commonly appear in chain-stores like B. Dalton's\r\nand Waldenbooks, and sell vigorously.\r\n\r\nSteve Jackson Games, Inc., of Austin, Texas, was a games company\r\nof the middle rank.  In 1989, SJG grossed about a million dollars.\r\nJackson himself had a good reputation in his industry as a talented\r\nand innovative designer of rather unconventional games, but his company\r\nwas something less than a titan of the field--certainly not like the\r\nmultimillion-dollar TSR Inc., or Britain's gigantic \"Games Workshop.\"\r\nSJG's Austin headquarters was a modest two-story brick office-suite,\r\ncluttered with phones, photocopiers, fax machines and computers.\r\nIt bustled with semi-organized activity and was littered with\r\nglossy promotional brochures and dog-eared science-fiction novels.\r\nAttached to the offices was a large tin-roofed warehouse piled twenty feet\r\nhigh with cardboard boxes of games and books.  Despite the weird imaginings\r\nthat went on within it, the SJG headquarters was quite a quotidian,\r\neveryday sort of place.  It looked like what it was:  a publishers' digs.\r\n\r\nBoth \"Car Wars\" and \"Illuminati\" were well-known, popular games.\r\nBut the mainstay of the Jackson organization was their Generic Universal\r\nRole-Playing System, \"G.U.R.P.S.\"  The GURPS system was considered solid\r\nand well-designed, an asset for players.  But perhaps the most popular\r\nfeature of the GURPS system was that it allowed gaming-masters to design\r\nscenarios that closely resembled well-known books, movies, and other works\r\nof fantasy.  Jackson had  licensed and adapted works from many science fiction\r\nand fantasy authors.  There was GURPS Conan, GURPS Riverworld,\r\nGURPS Horseclans, GURPS Witch World, names eminently familiar\r\nto science-fiction readers.  And there was GURPS Special Ops,\r\nfrom the world of espionage fantasy and unconventional warfare.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was GURPS Cyberpunk.\r\n\r\n\"Cyberpunk\" was a term given to certain science fiction writers\r\nwho had entered the genre in the 1980s.  \"Cyberpunk,\" as the label implies,\r\nhad two general distinguishing features.  First, its writers had a compelling\r\ninterest in information technology, an interest closely akin\r\nto science fiction's earlier fascination with space travel.\r\nAnd second, these writers  were \"punks,\" with all the\r\ndistinguishing features that that implies:  Bohemian artiness,\r\nyouth run wild, an air of deliberate rebellion, funny clothes and hair,\r\nodd politics, a fondness for abrasive rock and roll; in a word, trouble.\r\n\r\nThe \"cyberpunk\" SF writers were a small group of mostly college-educated\r\nwhite middle-class litterateurs, scattered through the US and Canada.\r\nOnly one, Rudy Rucker, a professor of computer science in Silicon Valley,\r\ncould rank with even the humblest computer hacker.  But, except for\r\nProfessor Rucker, the \"cyberpunk\" authors were not programmers\r\nor hardware experts; they considered themselves artists\r\n(as, indeed, did Professor Rucker).  However, these writers\r\nall owned computers, and took an intense and public interest\r\nin the social ramifications of the information industry.\r\n\r\nThe cyberpunks had a strong following among the global generation\r\nthat had grown up in a world of computers, multinational networks,\r\nand cable television. Their outlook was considered somewhat morbid,\r\ncynical, and dark, but then again, so was the outlook of their\r\ngenerational peers.  As that generation matured and increased\r\nin strength and influence, so did the cyberpunks.\r\nAs science-fiction writers went, they were doing\r\nfairly well for themselves.  By the late 1980s,\r\ntheir work had attracted attention from gaming companies,\r\nincluding Steve Jackson Games, which was planning a cyberpunk\r\nsimulation for the flourishing GURPS gaming-system.\r\n\r\nThe time seemed ripe for such a product, which had already been proven\r\nin the marketplace.  The first games- company out of the gate,\r\nwith a product boldly called \"Cyberpunk\" in defiance of possible\r\ninfringement-of-copyright suits, had been an upstart group called\r\nR. Talsorian.  Talsorian's Cyberpunk was a fairly decent game,\r\nbut the mechanics of the simulation system left a lot to be desired.\r\nCommercially, however, the game did very well.\r\n\r\nThe next cyberpunk game had been the even more successful Shadowrun\r\nby FASA Corporation.  The mechanics of this game were fine, but the\r\nscenario was rendered moronic by sappy fantasy elements like elves,\r\ntrolls, wizards, and  dragons--all highly ideologically-incorrect,\r\naccording to the hard-edged, high-tech standards of cyberpunk science fiction.\r\n\r\nOther game designers were champing at the bit.  Prominent among them\r\nwas the Mentor, a gentleman who, like most of his friends in the\r\nLegion of Doom, was quite the cyberpunk devotee.  Mentor reasoned\r\nthat the time had come for a REAL cyberpunk gaming-book--one that the\r\nprinces of computer-mischief in the Legion of Doom could play without\r\nlaughing themselves sick.  This book, GURPS Cyberpunk, would reek\r\nof culturally on-line authenticity.\r\n\r\nMentor was particularly well-qualified for this task.\r\nNaturally, he knew far more about computer-intrusion\r\nand digital skullduggery than any previously published\r\ncyberpunk author.  Not only that, but he was good at his work.\r\nA vivid imagination, combined with an instinctive feeling\r\nfor the working of systems and, especially, the loopholes\r\nwithin them, are excellent qualities for a professional game designer.\r\n\r\nBy March 1st, GURPS Cyberpunk was almost complete, ready to print and ship.\r\nSteve Jackson expected vigorous sales for this item, which, he hoped,\r\nwould keep the company financially afloat for several months.\r\nGURPS Cyberpunk, like the other GURPS \"modules,\" was not a \"game\"\r\nlike a Monopoly set, but a BOOK:  a bound paperback book the size\r\nof a glossy magazine, with a slick color cover, and pages full of text,\r\nillustrations, tables and footnotes.  It was advertised as a game,\r\nand was used as an aid to game-playing, but it was a book,\r\nwith an ISBN number, published in Texas, copyrighted,\r\nand sold in bookstores.\r\n\r\nAnd now, that book, stored on a computer, had gone out the door\r\nin the custody of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nThe day after the raid, Steve Jackson visited the local Secret Service\r\nheadquarters with a lawyer in tow.  There he confronted Tim Foley\r\n(still in Austin at that time) and demanded his book back.  But there\r\nwas trouble.  GURPS Cyberpunk, alleged a Secret Service agent to astonished\r\nbusinessman Steve Jackson, was \"a manual for computer crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's science fiction,\" Jackson said.\r\n\r\n\"No, this is real.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement was repeated several times, by several agents.\r\nJackson's ominously accurate game had passed from pure,\r\nobscure, small-scale fantasy into the impure, highly publicized,\r\nlarge-scale fantasy of the Hacker Crackdown.\r\n\r\nNo mention was made of the real reason for the search.\r\nAccording to their search warrant, the raiders had expected\r\nto find the E911 Document stored on Jackson's bulletin board system.\r\nBut that warrant was sealed; a procedure that most law enforcement agencies\r\nwill use only when lives are demonstrably in danger.  The raiders'\r\ntrue motives were not discovered until the Jackson search-warrant\r\nwas unsealed by his lawyers, many months later.  The Secret Service,\r\nand the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force,\r\nsaid absolutely nothing to Steve Jackson about any threat\r\nto the police 911 System.  They said nothing about the Atlanta Three,\r\nnothing about Phrack or Knight Lightning, nothing about Terminus.\r\n\r\nJackson was left to believe that his computers had been seized because\r\nhe intended to publish a science fiction book that law enforcement\r\nconsidered too dangerous to see print.\r\n\r\nThis misconception was repeated again and again, for months,\r\nto an ever-widening public audience.  It was not the truth of the case;\r\nbut as months passed, and this misconception was publicly printed again\r\nand again, it became one of the few publicly known \"facts\" about\r\nthe mysterious Hacker Crackdown.  The Secret Service had seized a computer\r\nto stop the publication of a cyberpunk science fiction book.\r\n\r\nThe second section of this book, \"The Digital Underground,\"\r\nis almost finished now.  We have become acquainted with all\r\nthe major figures of this case who actually belong to the\r\nunderground milieu of computer intrusion.  We have some idea\r\nof their history, their motives, their general modus operandi.\r\nWe now know, I hope, who they are, where they came from,\r\nand more or less what they want.  In the next section of this book,\r\n\"Law and Order,\" we will leave this milieu and directly enter the\r\nworld of America's computer-crime police.\r\n\r\nAt this point, however, I have another figure to introduce:  myself.\r\n\r\nMy name is Bruce Sterling.  I live in Austin, Texas, where I am\r\na science fiction writer by trade:  specifically, a CYBERPUNK\r\nscience fiction writer.\r\n\r\nLike my \"cyberpunk\" colleagues in the U.S. and Canada,\r\nI've never been entirely happy with this literary label--\r\nespecially after it became a synonym for computer criminal.\r\nBut I did once edit a book of stories by my colleagues,\r\ncalled  Mirrorshades:  the Cyberpunk Anthology, and I've\r\nlong been a writer of literary-critical cyberpunk manifestos.\r\nI am not a \"hacker\" of any description, though I do have readers\r\nin the digital underground.\r\n\r\nWhen the Steve Jackson Games seizure occurred, I naturally took\r\nan intense interest.  If \"cyberpunk\" books were being banned\r\nby federal police in my own home town, I reasonably wondered\r\nwhether I myself might be next.  Would my computer be seized\r\nby the Secret Service?  At the time, I was in possession\r\nof an aging Apple IIe without so much as a hard disk.\r\nIf I were to be raided as an author of computer-crime manuals,\r\nthe loss of my feeble word-processor would likely provoke more\r\nsnickers than sympathy.\r\n\r\nI'd known Steve Jackson for many years.  We knew\r\none another as colleagues, for we frequented\r\nthe same local science-fiction conventions.\r\nI'd played Jackson games, and recognized his cleverness;\r\nbut he certainly had never struck me as a potential mastermind\r\nof computer crime.\r\n\r\nI also knew a little about computer bulletin-board systems.\r\nIn the mid-1980s I had taken an active role in an Austin board\r\ncalled \"SMOF-BBS,\" one of the first boards dedicated to science fiction.\r\nI had a modem, and on occasion I'd logged on to Illuminati,\r\nwhich always looked entertainly wacky, but certainly harmless enough.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Jackson seizure, I had no experience\r\nwhatsoever with underground boards.  But I knew that no one\r\non Illuminati talked about breaking into systems illegally,\r\nor about robbing phone companies.  Illuminati didn't even\r\noffer pirated computer games.  Steve Jackson, like many creative artists,\r\nwas markedly touchy about theft of intellectual property.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that Jackson was either seriously suspected\r\nof some crime--in which case, he would be charged soon,\r\nand would have his day in court--or else he was innocent,\r\nin which case the Secret Service would quickly return his equipment,\r\nand everyone would have a good laugh.  I rather expected the good laugh.\r\nThe situation was not without its comic side.  The raid, known\r\nas the \"Cyberpunk Bust\" in the science fiction community,\r\nwas winning a great deal of free national publicity both\r\nfor Jackson himself and the \"cyberpunk\" science fiction\r\nwriters generally.\r\n\r\nBesides, science fiction people are used to being misinterpreted.\r\nScience fiction is a colorful, disreputable, slipshod occupation,\r\nfull of unlikely oddballs, which, of course, is why we like it.\r\nWeirdness can be an occupational hazard in our field.  People who\r\nwear Halloween costumes are sometimes mistaken for monsters.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time--back in 1939, in New York City--\r\nscience fiction and the U.S. Secret Service collided in\r\na comic case of mistaken identity.  This weird incident\r\ninvolved a literary group quite famous in science fiction,\r\nknown as \"the Futurians,\" whose membership included\r\nsuch future genre greats as Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl,\r\nand Damon Knight.  The Futurians were every bit as\r\noffbeat and wacky as any of their spiritual descendants,\r\nincluding the cyberpunks, and were given to communal living,\r\nspontaneous group renditions of light opera, and midnight fencing\r\nexhibitions on the lawn.  The Futurians didn't have bulletin\r\nboard systems, but they did have the technological equivalent\r\nin 1939--mimeographs and a private printing press.  These were\r\nin steady use, producing a stream of science-fiction fan magazines,\r\nliterary manifestos, and weird articles, which were picked up\r\nin ink-sticky bundles by a succession of strange, gangly,\r\nspotty young men in fedoras and overcoats.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors grew alarmed at the antics of the Futurians\r\nand reported them to the Secret Service as suspected counterfeiters.\r\nIn the winter of 1939, a squad of USSS agents with drawn guns burst into\r\n\"Futurian House,\" prepared to confiscate the forged currency and illicit\r\nprinting presses.  There they discovered a slumbering science fiction fan\r\nnamed George Hahn, a guest of the Futurian commune who had just arrived\r\nin New York.  George Hahn managed to explain himself and his group,\r\nand the Secret Service agents left the Futurians in peace henceforth.\r\n(Alas, Hahn died in 1991, just before I had discovered this astonishing\r\nhistorical parallel, and just before I could interview him for this book.)\r\n\r\nBut the Jackson case did not come to a swift and comic end.\r\nNo quick answers came his way, or mine; no swift reassurances\r\nthat all was right in the digital world, that matters were well\r\nin hand after all.  Quite the opposite.  In my alternate role\r\nas a sometime pop-science journalist, I interviewed Jackson\r\nand his staff for an article in a British magazine.\r\nThe strange details of the raid left me more concerned than ever.\r\nWithout its computers, the company had been financially\r\nand operationally crippled.  Half the SJG workforce,\r\na group of entirely innocent people, had been sorrowfully fired,\r\ndeprived of their livelihoods by the seizure.  It began to dawn on me\r\nthat authors--American writers--might well have their computers seized,\r\nunder sealed warrants, without any criminal charge; and that,\r\nas Steve Jackson had discovered, there was no immediate recourse for this.\r\nThis was no joke; this wasn't science fiction; this was real.\r\n\r\nI determined to put science fiction aside until I had discovered\r\nwhat had happened and where this trouble had come from.\r\nIt was time to enter the purportedly real world of electronic\r\nfree expression and computer crime.  Hence, this book.\r\nHence, the world of the telcos; and the world of the digital underground;\r\nand next, the world of the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE:  LAW AND ORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the various anti-hacker activities of 1990, \"Operation Sundevil\"\r\nhad by far the highest public profile.  The sweeping, nationwide\r\ncomputer seizures of May 8, 1990 were unprecedented in scope and highly,\r\nif rather selectively, publicized.\r\n\r\nUnlike the efforts of the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force,\r\n\"Operation Sundevil\" was not intended to combat \"hacking\" in the sense\r\nof computer intrusion or sophisticated raids on telco switching stations.\r\nNor did it have anything to do with hacker misdeeds with AT&T's software,\r\nor with Southern Bell's proprietary documents.\r\n\r\nInstead, \"Operation Sundevil\" was a crackdown on those traditional scourges\r\nof the digital underground:  credit-card theft and telephone code abuse.\r\nThe ambitious activities out of Chicago, and the somewhat lesser-known\r\nbut  vigorous anti-hacker actions of the New York State Police in 1990,\r\nwere never a part of \"Operation Sundevil\" per se, which was based in Arizona.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, after the spectacular May 8 raids, the public, misled by\r\npolice secrecy, hacker panic, and a puzzled national press-corps,\r\nconflated all aspects of the nationwide crackdown in 1990 under\r\nthe blanket term \"Operation Sundevil.\"  \"Sundevil\" is still the best-known\r\nsynonym for the crackdown of 1990.  But the Arizona organizers of \"Sundevil\"\r\ndid not really deserve this reputation--any more, for instance, than all\r\nhackers deserve a reputation as \"hackers.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some justice in this confused perception, though.\r\nFor one thing, the confusion was abetted by the Washington office\r\nof the Secret Service, who responded to Freedom of Information Act\r\nrequests on \"Operation Sundevil\" by referring investigators\r\nto the publicly known cases of Knight Lightning and the Atlanta Three.\r\nAnd \"Sundevil\" was certainly the largest aspect of the Crackdown,\r\nthe most deliberate and the best-organized.  As a crackdown on electronic\r\nfraud, \"Sundevil\" lacked the frantic pace of the war on the Legion of Doom;\r\non the contrary, Sundevil's targets were picked out with cool deliberation\r\nover an elaborate investigation lasting two full years.\r\n\r\nAnd once again the targets were bulletin board systems.\r\n\r\nBoards can be powerful aids to organized fraud.  Underground boards carry\r\nlively, extensive, detailed, and often quite flagrant \"discussions\" of\r\nlawbreaking techniques and lawbreaking activities.  \"Discussing\" crime\r\nin the abstract, or \"discussing\" the particulars of criminal cases,\r\nis not illegal--but there are stern state and federal laws against\r\ncoldbloodedly conspiring in groups in order to commit crimes.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of police, people who actively conspire to break the law\r\nare not regarded as \"clubs,\" \"debating salons,\" \"users' groups,\" or\r\n\"free speech advocates.\"  Rather, such people tend to find themselves\r\nformally indicted by prosecutors as \"gangs,\" \"racketeers,\" \"corrupt\r\norganizations\" and \"organized crime figures.\"\r\n\r\nWhat's more, the illicit data contained on outlaw boards goes well beyond\r\nmere acts of speech and/or possible criminal conspiracy.  As we have seen,\r\nit was common practice in the digital underground to post purloined telephone\r\ncodes on boards, for any phreak or hacker who cared to abuse them.  Is posting\r\ndigital booty of this sort supposed to be protected by the First Amendment?\r\nHardly--though the issue, like most issues in cyberspace, is not entirely\r\nresolved.  Some theorists argue that to merely RECITE a number publicly\r\nis not illegal--only its USE is illegal.  But anti-hacker police point out\r\nthat magazines and newspapers (more traditional forms of free expression)\r\nnever publish stolen telephone codes (even though this might well\r\nraise their circulation).\r\n\r\nStolen credit card numbers, being riskier and more valuable,\r\nwere less often publicly posted on boards--but there is no question\r\nthat some underground boards carried \"carding\" traffic,\r\ngenerally exchanged through private mail.\r\n\r\nUnderground boards also carried handy programs for \"scanning\" telephone\r\ncodes and raiding credit card companies, as well as the usual obnoxious\r\ngalaxy of pirated software, cracked passwords, blue-box schematics,\r\nintrusion manuals, anarchy files, porn files, and so forth.\r\n\r\nBut besides their nuisance potential for the spread of illicit knowledge,\r\nbulletin boards have another vitally interesting aspect for the\r\nprofessional investigator.  Bulletin boards are cram-full of EVIDENCE.\r\nAll that busy trading of electronic mail, all those hacker boasts,\r\nbrags and struts, even the stolen codes and cards, can be neat,\r\nelectronic, real-time recordings of criminal activity.\r\nAs an investigator, when you seize a pirate board, you have\r\nscored a coup as effective as tapping phones or intercepting mail.\r\nHowever, you have not actually tapped a phone or intercepted a letter.\r\nThe rules of evidence regarding phone-taps and mail interceptions are old,\r\nstern and well-understood by police, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.\r\nThe rules of evidence regarding boards are new, waffling, and understood\r\nby nobody at all.\r\n\r\nSundevil was the largest crackdown on boards in world history.\r\nOn May 7, 8, and 9, 1990, about forty-two computer systems were seized.\r\nOf those forty-two computers, about twenty-five actually were running boards.\r\n(The vagueness of this estimate is attributable to the vagueness of\r\n(a) what a \"computer system\" is, and (b) what it actually means to\r\n\"run a board\" with one--or with two computers, or with three.)\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-five boards vanished into police custody in May 1990.\r\nAs we have seen, there are an estimated 30,000 boards in America today.\r\nIf we assume that one board in a hundred is up to no good with codes\r\nand cards (which rather flatters the honesty of the board-using community),\r\nthen that would leave 2,975 outlaw boards untouched by Sundevil.\r\nSundevil seized about one tenth of one percent of all computer\r\nbulletin boards in America.  Seen objectively, this is something less\r\nthan a comprehensive assault.  In 1990, Sundevil's organizers--\r\nthe team at the Phoenix Secret Service office, and the Arizona\r\nAttorney General's office-- had a list of at least THREE HUNDRED\r\nboards that they considered fully deserving of search and seizure warrants.\r\nThe twenty-five boards actually seized were merely among the most obvious\r\nand egregious of this much larger list of candidates.  All these boards\r\nhad been examined beforehand--either by informants, who had passed printouts\r\nto the Secret Service, or by Secret Service agents themselves, who not only\r\ncome equipped with modems but know how to use them.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of motives for Sundevil.  First, it offered\r\na chance to get ahead of the curve on wire-fraud crimes.\r\nTracking back credit-card ripoffs to their perpetrators\r\ncan be appallingly difficult.  If these miscreants\r\nhave any kind of electronic sophistication, they can snarl\r\ntheir tracks through the phone network into a mind-boggling,\r\nuntraceable mess, while still managing to \"reach out and rob someone.\"\r\nBoards, however, full of brags and boasts, codes and cards,\r\noffer evidence in the handy congealed form.\r\n\r\nSeizures themselves--the mere physical removal of machines--\r\ntends to take the pressure off.  During Sundevil, a large number\r\nof code kids, warez d00dz, and credit card thieves would be deprived\r\nof those boards--their  means of community and conspiracy--in one swift blow.\r\nAs for the sysops themselves (commonly among the boldest offenders)\r\nthey would be directly stripped of their computer equipment,\r\nand rendered digitally mute and blind.\r\n\r\nAnd this aspect of Sundevil was carried out with great success.\r\nSundevil seems to have been a complete tactical surprise--\r\nunlike the fragmentary and continuing seizures of the war on the\r\nLegion of Doom, Sundevil was precisely timed and utterly overwhelming.\r\nAt least forty \"computers\" were seized during May 7, 8 and 9, 1990,\r\nin Cincinnati, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, Phoenix, Tucson,\r\nRichmond, San Diego, San Jose, Pittsburgh and San Francisco.\r\nSome cities saw multiple raids, such as the five separate raids\r\nin the New York City environs.  Plano, Texas (essentially a suburb of\r\nthe Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, and a hub of the telecommunications industry)\r\nsaw four computer seizures.  Chicago, ever in the forefront, saw its own\r\nlocal Sundevil raid, briskly carried out by Secret Service agents\r\nTimothy Foley and Barbara Golden.\r\n\r\nMany of these raids occurred, not in the cities proper,\r\nbut in associated white-middle class suburbs--places like\r\nMount Lebanon, Pennsylvania and Clark Lake, Michigan.\r\nThere were a few raids on offices; most took place in people's homes,\r\nthe classic hacker basements and bedrooms.\r\n\r\nThe Sundevil raids were searches and seizures, not a group of mass arrests.\r\nThere were only four arrests during Sundevil.  \"Tony the Trashman,\"\r\na longtime teenage bete noire of the Arizona Racketeering unit,\r\nwas arrested in Tucson on May 9.  \"Dr. Ripco,\" sysop of an outlaw board\r\nwith the misfortune to exist in Chicago itself, was also arrested--\r\non illegal weapons charges.  Local units also arrested a 19-year-old\r\nfemale phone phreak named \"Electra\" in Pennsylvania, and a male juvenile\r\nin California.  Federal agents however were not seeking arrests, but computers.\r\n\r\nHackers are generally not indicted (if at all) until the evidence\r\nin their seized computers is evaluated--a process that can take weeks,\r\nmonths--even years.  When hackers are arrested on the spot, it's generally\r\nan arrest for other reasons.  Drugs and/or illegal weapons show up in a good\r\nthird of anti-hacker computer seizures (though not during Sundevil).\r\n\r\nThat scofflaw teenage hackers (or their parents) should have marijuana\r\nin their homes is probably not a shocking revelation, but the surprisingly\r\ncommon presence of illegal firearms in hacker dens is a bit disquieting.\r\nA Personal Computer can be a great equalizer for the techno-cowboy--\r\nmuch like that more traditional American \"Great Equalizer,\"\r\nthe Personal Sixgun.  Maybe it's not all that surprising\r\nthat some guy obsessed with power through illicit technology\r\nwould also have a few illicit high-velocity-impact devices around.\r\nAn element of the digital underground particularly dotes on those\r\n\"anarchy philes,\" and this element tends to shade into the crackpot milieu\r\nof survivalists, gun-nuts, anarcho-leftists and the ultra-libertarian\r\nright-wing.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that hacker raids to date have uncovered any\r\nmajor crack-dens or illegal arsenals; but Secret Service agents\r\ndo not regard \"hackers\" as \"just kids.\"  They regard hackers as\r\nunpredictable people, bright and slippery.  It doesn't help matters\r\nthat the hacker himself has been \"hiding behind his keyboard\"\r\nall this time.  Commonly, police have no idea what he looks like.\r\nThis makes him an unknown quantity, someone best treated with\r\nproper caution.\r\n\r\nTo date, no hacker has come out shooting, though they do sometimes brag on\r\nboards that they will do just that.  Threats of this sort are taken seriously.\r\nSecret Service hacker raids tend to be swift, comprehensive, well-manned\r\n(even over-manned);  and agents generally burst through every door\r\nin the home at once, sometimes with drawn guns.  Any potential resistance\r\nis swiftly quelled. Hacker raids are usually raids on people's homes.\r\nIt can be a very dangerous business to raid an American home;\r\npeople can panic when strangers invade their sanctum.  Statistically speaking,\r\nthe most dangerous thing a policeman can do is to enter someone's home.\r\n(The second most dangerous thing is to stop a car in traffic.)\r\nPeople have guns in their homes.  More cops are hurt in homes\r\nthan are ever hurt in biker bars or massage parlors.\r\n\r\nBut in any case, no one was hurt during Sundevil,\r\nor indeed during any part of the Hacker Crackdown.\r\n\r\nNor were there any allegations of any physical mistreatment of a suspect.\r\nGuns were pointed, interrogations were sharp and prolonged; but no one\r\nin 1990 claimed any act of brutality by any crackdown raider.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the forty or so computers, Sundevil reaped floppy disks\r\nin particularly great abundance--an estimated 23,000 of them, which\r\nnaturally included every manner of illegitimate data:  pirated games,\r\nstolen codes, hot credit card numbers, the complete text and software\r\nof entire pirate bulletin-boards.  These floppy disks, which remain\r\nin police custody today, offer a gigantic, almost embarrassingly\r\nrich source of possible criminal indictments.  These 23,000 floppy disks\r\nalso include a thus-far unknown quantity of legitimate computer games,\r\nlegitimate software, purportedly \"private\" mail from boards,\r\nbusiness records, and personal correspondence of all kinds.\r\n\r\nStandard computer-crime search warrants lay great emphasis on seizing\r\nwritten documents as well as computers--specifically including photocopies,\r\ncomputer printouts, telephone bills, address books, logs, notes,\r\nmemoranda and correspondence.  In practice, this has meant that diaries,\r\ngaming magazines, software documentation, nonfiction books on hacking\r\nand computer security, sometimes even science fiction novels, have all\r\nvanished out the door in police custody.  A wide variety of electronic items\r\nhave been known to vanish as well, including telephones, televisions, answering\r\nmachines, Sony Walkmans, desktop printers, compact disks, and audiotapes.\r\n\r\nNo fewer than 150 members of the Secret Service were sent into\r\nthe field during Sundevil.  They were commonly accompanied by\r\nsquads of local and/or state police.  Most of these officers--\r\nespecially  the locals--had never been on an anti-hacker raid before.\r\n(This was one good reason, in fact, why so many of them were invited along\r\nin the first place.)  Also, the presence of a uniformed police officer\r\nassures the raidees that the people entering their homes are, in fact, police.\r\nSecret Service agents wear plain clothes.  So do the telco security experts\r\nwho commonly accompany the Secret Service on raids (and who make no particular\r\neffort to identify themselves as mere employees of telephone companies).\r\n\r\nA typical hacker raid goes something like this.  First, police storm in\r\nrapidly, through every entrance, with overwhelming force,\r\nin the assumption that this tactic will keep casualties to a minimum.\r\nSecond, possible suspects are immediately removed from the vicinity\r\nof any and all computer systems, so that they will have no chance\r\nto purge or destroy computer evidence.  Suspects are herded into a room\r\nwithout computers, commonly the living room, and kept under guard--\r\nnot ARMED guard, for the guns are swiftly holstered, but under guard\r\nnevertheless.  They are presented with the search warrant and warned\r\nthat anything they say may be held against them.  Commonly they have\r\na great deal to say, especially if they are unsuspecting parents.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the house is the \"hot spot\"--a computer tied to a phone\r\nline (possibly several computers and several phones).  Commonly it's\r\na teenager's bedroom, but it can be anywhere in the house;\r\nthere may be several such rooms.  This \"hot spot\" is put in charge\r\nof a two-agent team, the \"finder\" and the \"recorder.\"  The \"finder\"\r\nis computer-trained, commonly the case agent who has actually obtained\r\nthe search warrant from a judge.  He or she understands what is being sought,\r\nand actually carries out the seizures: unplugs machines, opens drawers,\r\ndesks, files, floppy-disk containers, etc.  The \"recorder\" photographs\r\nall the equipment, just as it stands--especially the tangle of\r\nwired connections in the back, which can otherwise be a real nightmare\r\nto restore.  The recorder will also commonly photograph every room\r\nin the house, lest some wily criminal claim that the police had robbed him\r\nduring the search.  Some recorders carry videocams or tape recorders;\r\nhowever, it's more common for the recorder to simply take written notes.\r\nObjects are described and numbered as the finder seizes them, generally\r\non standard preprinted police inventory forms.\r\n\r\nEven Secret Service agents were not, and are not, expert computer users.\r\nThey have not made, and do not make, judgements on the fly about potential\r\nthreats posed by various forms of equipment.  They may exercise discretion;\r\nthey may leave Dad his computer, for instance, but they don't HAVE to.\r\nStandard computer-crime search warrants, which date back to the early 80s,\r\nuse a sweeping language that targets computers, most anything attached\r\nto a computer, most anything used to operate a computer--most anything\r\nthat remotely resembles a computer--plus most any and all written documents\r\nsurrounding it. Computer-crime investigators have strongly urged agents\r\nto seize the works.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, Operation Sundevil appears to have been a complete success.\r\nBoards went down all over America, and were shipped en masse to the computer\r\ninvestigation lab of the Secret Service, in Washington DC, along with the\r\n23,000 floppy disks and unknown quantities of printed material.\r\n\r\nBut the seizure of twenty-five boards, and the multi-megabyte mountains\r\nof possibly useful evidence contained in these boards (and in their owners'\r\nother computers, also out the door), were far from the only motives for\r\nOperation Sundevil.  An unprecedented action of great ambition and size,\r\nSundevil's motives can only be described as political.  It was a\r\npublic-relations effort, meant to pass certain messages, meant to make\r\ncertain situations clear:  both in the mind of the general public,\r\nand in the minds of various constituencies of the electronic community.\r\n\r\n First --and this motivation was vital--a \"message\" would be sent from\r\nlaw enforcement to the digital underground.  This very message was recited\r\nin so many words by Garry M. Jenkins, the Assistant Director of the\r\nUS Secret Service, at the Sundevil press conference in Phoenix on\r\nMay 9, 1990, immediately after the raids.  In brief, hackers were\r\nmistaken in their foolish belief that they could hide behind the\r\n\"relative anonymity of their computer terminals.\"  On the contrary,\r\nthey should fully understand that state and federal cops were\r\nactively patrolling the beat in cyberspace--that they were\r\non the watch everywhere, even in those sleazy and secretive\r\ndens of cybernetic vice, the underground boards.\r\n\r\nThis is not an unusual message for police to publicly convey to crooks.\r\nThe message is a standard message; only the context is new.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, the Sundevil raids were the digital equivalent\r\nof the standard vice-squad crackdown on massage parlors, porno bookstores,\r\nhead-shops, or floating crap-games.  There may be few or no arrests in a raid\r\nof this sort; no convictions, no trials, no interrogations.  In cases of this\r\nsort, police may well walk out the door with many pounds of sleazy magazines,\r\nX-rated videotapes, sex toys, gambling equipment, baggies of marijuana. . . .\r\n\r\nOf course, if something truly horrendous is discovered by the raiders,\r\nthere will be arrests and prosecutions.  Far more likely, however,\r\nthere will simply be a brief but sharp disruption of the closed\r\nand secretive world of the nogoodniks.  There will be \"street hassle.\"\r\n\"Heat.\"  \"Deterrence.\"  And, of course, the immediate loss of the seized goods.\r\nIt is very unlikely that any of this seized material will ever be returned.\r\nWhether charged or not, whether convicted or not, the perpetrators will\r\nalmost surely lack the nerve ever to ask for this stuff to be given back.\r\n\r\nArrests and trials--putting people in jail--may involve all kinds of\r\nformal legalities; but dealing with the justice system is far from the only\r\ntask of police. Police do not simply arrest people.  They don't simply\r\nput people in jail.  That is not how the police perceive their jobs.\r\nPolice \"protect and serve.\" Police \"keep the peace,\" they \"keep public order.\"\r\nLike other forms of public relations, keeping public order is not an\r\nexact science.  Keeping public order is something of an art-form.\r\n\r\nIf a group of tough-looking teenage hoodlums was loitering on a street-corner,\r\nno one would be surprised to see a street-cop arrive and sternly order\r\nthem to \"break it up.\"  On the contrary, the surprise would come if one\r\nof these ne'er-do-wells stepped briskly into a phone-booth,\r\ncalled a civil rights lawyer, and instituted a civil suit\r\nin defense of his Constitutional rights of free speech\r\nand free assembly.  But something much  along this line\r\nwas one of the many anomolous outcomes of the Hacker Crackdown.\r\n\r\nSundevil also carried useful \"messages\" for other constituents of\r\nthe electronic community.  These messages may not have been read\r\naloud from the Phoenix podium in front of the press corps,\r\nbut there was little mistaking their meaning.  There was a message\r\nof reassurance for the primary victims of coding and carding:\r\nthe telcos, and the credit companies.  Sundevil was greeted with joy\r\nby the security officers of the electronic business community.\r\nAfter years of high-tech harassment and spiralling revenue losses,\r\ntheir complaints of rampant outlawry were being taken seriously by\r\nlaw enforcement.  No more head-scratching or dismissive shrugs;\r\nno more feeble excuses about \"lack of computer-trained officers\" or\r\nthe low priority of \"victimless\" white-collar telecommunication crimes.\r\n\r\nComputer-crime experts have long believed that computer-related offenses\r\nare drastically under-reported.  They regard this as a major open scandal\r\nof their field.  Some victims are reluctant to come forth, because they\r\nbelieve that police and prosecutors are not computer-literate,\r\nand can and will do nothing.  Others are embarrassed by\r\ntheir vulnerabilities, and will take strong measures\r\nto avoid any publicity; this is especially true of banks,\r\nwho fear a loss of investor confidence should an embezzlement-case\r\nor wire-fraud surface.  And some victims are so helplessly confused\r\nby their own high technology that they never even realize that\r\na crime has occurred--even when they have been fleeced to the bone.\r\n\r\nThe results of this situation can be dire.\r\nCriminals escape apprehension and punishment.\r\nThe computer-crime units that do exist, can't get work.\r\nThe true scope of computer-crime:  its size, its real nature,\r\nthe scope of its threats, and the legal remedies for it--\r\nall remain obscured.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is very little publicized, but it is a cause\r\nof genuine concern.  Where there is persistent crime,\r\nbut no effective police protection, then vigilantism can result.\r\nTelcos, banks, credit companies, the major corporations who\r\nmaintain extensive computer networks vulnerable to hacking\r\n--these organizations are powerful, wealthy, and\r\npolitically influential.  They are disinclined to be\r\npushed around by crooks (or by most anyone else,\r\nfor that matter).  They often maintain well-organized\r\nprivate security forces, commonly run by\r\nexperienced veterans of military and police units,\r\nwho have left public service for the greener pastures\r\nof the private sector.  For police, the corporate\r\nsecurity manager can be a powerful ally; but if this\r\ngentleman finds no allies in the police, and the\r\npressure is on from his board-of-directors,\r\nhe may quietly take certain matters into his own hands.\r\n\r\nNor is there any lack of disposable hired-help in the\r\ncorporate security business.  Private security agencies--\r\nthe `security business' generally--grew explosively in the 1980s.\r\nToday there are spooky gumshoed armies of \"security consultants,\"\r\n\"rent-a- cops,\" \"private eyes,\" \"outside experts\"--every manner\r\nof shady operator who retails in \"results\" and discretion.\r\nOr course, many of these gentlemen and ladies may be paragons\r\nof professional and moral rectitude.  But as anyone\r\nwho has read a hard-boiled detective novel knows,\r\npolice tend to be less than fond of this sort\r\nof private-sector competition.\r\n\r\nCompanies in search of computer-security have even been\r\nknown to hire hackers.  Police shudder at this prospect.\r\n\r\nPolice treasure good relations with the business community.\r\nRarely will you see a policeman so indiscreet as to allege\r\npublicly that some major employer in his state or city has succumbed\r\nto paranoia and gone off the rails.  Nevertheless,\r\npolice --and computer police in particular--are aware\r\nof this possibility.  Computer-crime police can and do\r\nspend up to half of their business hours just doing\r\npublic relations:  seminars, \"dog and pony shows,\"\r\nsometimes with parents' groups or computer users,\r\nbut generally with their core audience: the likely\r\nvictims of hacking crimes.  These, of course, are telcos,\r\ncredit card companies and large computer-equipped corporations.\r\nThe police strongly urge these people, as good citizens,\r\nto report offenses and press criminal charges;\r\nthey pass the message that there is someone in authority who cares,\r\nunderstands, and, best of all, will take useful action\r\nshould a computer-crime occur.\r\n\r\nBut reassuring talk is cheap.  Sundevil offered action.\r\n\r\nThe final message of Sundevil was intended for internal consumption\r\nby law enforcement.  Sundevil was offered as proof that the community\r\nof American computer-crime police  had come of age.  Sundevil was\r\nproof that enormous things like Sundevil itself could now be accomplished.\r\nSundevil was proof that the Secret Service and its local law-enforcement\r\nallies could act like a well-oiled machine--(despite the hampering use\r\nof those scrambled phones).  It was also proof that the Arizona Organized\r\nCrime and Racketeering Unit--the sparkplug of Sundevil--ranked with the best\r\nin the world in ambition, organization, and sheer conceptual daring.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a final fillip, Sundevil was a message from the Secret Service\r\nto their longtime rivals in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\r\nBy Congressional fiat, both USSS and FBI formally share jurisdiction\r\nover federal computer-crimebusting activities.  Neither of these groups\r\nhas ever been remotely happy with this muddled situation.  It seems to\r\nsuggest that Congress cannot make up its mind as to which of these groups\r\nis better qualified.  And there is scarcely a G-man or a Special Agent\r\nanywhere without a very firm opinion on that topic.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nFor the neophyte, one of the most puzzling aspects of the crackdown\r\non hackers is why the United States Secret Service has anything at all\r\nto do with this matter.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service is best known for its primary public role:\r\nits agents protect the President of the United States.\r\nThey also guard the President's family, the Vice President and his family,\r\nformer Presidents, and Presidential candidates.  They sometimes guard\r\nforeign dignitaries who are visiting the United States, especially foreign\r\nheads of state, and have been known to accompany American officials\r\non diplomatic missions overseas.\r\n\r\nSpecial Agents of the Secret Service don't wear uniforms, but the\r\nSecret Service also has two uniformed police agencies.  There's the\r\nformer White House Police (now known as the Secret Service Uniformed Division,\r\nsince they currently guard foreign embassies in Washington, as well as the\r\nWhite House itself).  And there's the uniformed Treasury Police Force.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service has been charged by Congress with a number\r\nof little-known duties. They guard the precious metals in Treasury vaults.\r\nThey guard the most valuable historical documents of the United States:\r\noriginals of the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence,\r\nLincoln's Second Inaugural Address, an American-owned copy of\r\nthe Magna Carta, and so forth.  Once they were assigned to guard\r\nthe Mona Lisa, on her American tour in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nThe entire Secret Service is a division of the Treasury Department.\r\nSecret Service Special Agents (there are about 1,900 of them)\r\nare bodyguards for the President et al, but they all work for the Treasury.\r\nAnd the Treasury (through its divisions of the U.S. Mint and the\r\nBureau of Engraving and Printing) prints the nation's money.\r\n\r\nAs Treasury police, the Secret Service guards the nation's currency;\r\nit is the only federal law enforcement agency with direct jurisdiction\r\nover counterfeiting and forgery.  It analyzes documents for authenticity,\r\nand its fight against fake cash is still quite lively (especially since\r\nthe skilled counterfeiters of Medellin, Columbia have gotten into the act).\r\nGovernment checks, bonds, and other obligations, which exist in untold\r\nmillions and are worth untold billions, are common targets for forgery,\r\nwhich the Secret Service also battles.  It even handles forgery\r\nof postage stamps.\r\n\r\nBut cash is fading in importance today as money has become electronic.\r\nAs necessity beckoned, the Secret Service moved from fighting the\r\ncounterfeiting of paper currency and the forging of checks,\r\nto the protection of funds transferred by wire.\r\n\r\nFrom wire-fraud, it was a simple skip-and-jump to what is formally\r\nknown as \"access device fraud.\"  Congress granted the Secret Service\r\nthe authority to investigate \"access device fraud\"  under Title 18\r\nof the United States Code (U.S.C.  Section 1029).\r\n\r\nThe term \"access device\" seems intuitively simple.  It's some kind\r\nof high-tech gizmo you use to get money with.  It makes good sense\r\nto put this sort of thing in the charge of counterfeiting and\r\nwire-fraud experts.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Section 1029, the term \"access device\" is very\r\ngenerously defined.  An access device is:  \"any card, plate,\r\ncode, account number, or other means of account access\r\nthat can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device,\r\nto obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value,\r\nor that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Access device\" can therefore be construed to include credit cards\r\nthemselves (a popular forgery item nowadays).  It also includes credit card\r\naccount NUMBERS, those standards of the digital underground.  The same goes\r\nfor telephone charge cards (an increasingly popular item with telcos,\r\nwho are tired of being robbed of pocket change by phone-booth thieves).\r\nAnd also telephone access CODES, those OTHER standards of the digital\r\nunderground.  (Stolen telephone codes may not \"obtain money,\" but they\r\ncertainly do obtain valuable \"services,\" which is specifically forbidden\r\nby Section 1029.)\r\n\r\nWe can now see that Section 1029 already pits the United States Secret Service\r\ndirectly against the digital underground, without any mention at all of\r\nthe word \"computer.\"\r\n\r\nStandard phreaking devices, like \"blue boxes,\" used to steal phone service\r\nfrom old-fashioned mechanical switches, are unquestionably \"counterfeit\r\naccess devices.\"  Thanks to Sec.1029, it is not only illegal to USE\r\ncounterfeit access devices, but it is even illegal to BUILD them.\r\n\"Producing,\" \"designing\" \"duplicating\" or \"assembling\" blue boxes\r\nare all federal crimes today, and if you do this, the Secret Service\r\nhas been charged by Congress to come after you.\r\n\r\nAutomatic Teller Machines, which replicated all over America during the 1980s,\r\nare definitely \"access devices,\" too, and an attempt to tamper with their\r\npunch-in codes and plastic bank cards falls directly under Sec. 1029.\r\n\r\nSection 1029 is remarkably elastic.  Suppose you find a computer password\r\nin somebody's trash.  That password might be a \"code\"--it's certainly a\r\n\"means of account access.\"  Now suppose you log on to a computer\r\nand copy some software for yourself.  You've certainly obtained\r\n\"service\" (computer service) and a \"thing of value\" (the software).\r\nSuppose you tell a dozen friends about your swiped password,\r\nand let them use it, too.  Now you're \"trafficking in unauthorized\r\naccess devices.\"  And when the Prophet, a member of the Legion of Doom,\r\npassed a stolen telephone company document to Knight Lightning\r\nat Phrack magazine, they were both charged under Sec. 1029!\r\n\r\nThere are two limitations on Section 1029.  First, the offense must\r\n\"affect interstate or foreign commerce\" in order to become a matter\r\nof federal jurisdiction.  The term \"affecting commerce\" is not well defined;\r\nbut you may take it as a given that the Secret Service can take an interest\r\nif you've done most anything that happens to cross a state line.\r\nState and local police can be touchy about their jurisdictions,\r\nand can sometimes be mulish when the feds show up.  But when it comes\r\nto computer-crime, the local police are pathetically grateful\r\nfor federal help--in fact they complain that they can't get enough of it.\r\nIf you're stealing long-distance service, you're almost certainly crossing\r\nstate lines, and you're definitely \"affecting the interstate commerce\"\r\nof the telcos.  And if you're abusing credit cards by ordering stuff\r\nout of glossy catalogs from, say, Vermont, you're in for it.\r\n\r\nThe second limitation is money.  As a rule, the feds don't pursue\r\npenny-ante offenders.  Federal judges will dismiss cases that appear\r\nto waste their time.  Federal crimes must be serious;  Section 1029\r\nspecifies a minimum loss of a thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the very next section of Title 18, which is Section 1030,\r\n\"Fraud and related activity in connection with computers.\"  This statute\r\ngives the Secret Service direct jurisdiction over acts of computer intrusion.\r\nOn the face of it, the Secret Service would now seem to command the field.\r\nSection 1030, however, is nowhere near so ductile as Section 1029.\r\n\r\nThe first annoyance is Section 1030(d), which reads:\r\n\r\n\"(d) The United States Secret Service shall,\r\nIN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER AGENCY HAVING SUCH AUTHORITY,\r\nhave the authority to investigate offenses under this section.\r\nSuch authority of the United States Secret Service shall be\r\nexercised in accordance with an agreement which shall be entered\r\ninto by the Secretary  of the Treasury AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\"\r\n(Author's italics.) [Represented by capitals.]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is the titular head of the Secret Service,\r\nwhile the Attorney General is in charge of the FBI.  In Section (d),\r\nCongress shrugged off responsibility for the computer-crime turf-battle\r\nbetween the Service and the Bureau, and made them fight it out all\r\nby themselves.  The result was a rather dire one for the Secret Service,\r\nfor the FBI ended up with exclusive jurisdiction over computer break-ins\r\nhaving to do with national security, foreign espionage, federally insured\r\nbanks, and U.S. military bases, while retaining joint jurisdiction over\r\nall the other computer intrusions.  Essentially, when it comes to Section 1030,\r\nthe FBI not only gets the real glamor stuff for itself, but can peer over the\r\nshoulder of the Secret Service and barge in to meddle whenever it suits them.\r\n\r\nThe second problem has to do with the dicey term\r\n\"Federal interest computer.\"  Section 1030(a)(2)\r\nmakes it illegal to \"access a computer without authorization\"\r\nif that computer belongs to a financial institution or an issuer\r\nof credit cards (fraud cases, in other words).  Congress was quite\r\nwilling to give the Secret Service jurisdiction over\r\nmoney-transferring computers, but Congress balked at\r\nletting them investigate any and all computer intrusions.\r\nInstead, the USSS had to settle for the money machines\r\nand the \"Federal interest computers.\"  A \"Federal interest computer\"\r\nis a computer which the government itself owns, or is using.\r\nLarge networks of interstate computers, linked over state lines,\r\nare also considered to be of \"Federal interest.\"  (This notion of\r\n\"Federal interest\" is legally rather foggy and has never been\r\nclearly defined in the courts.  The Secret Service has never yet\r\nhad its hand slapped for investigating computer break-ins that were NOT\r\nof \"Federal interest,\" but conceivably someday this might happen.)\r\n\r\nSo the Secret Service's authority over \"unauthorized access\"\r\nto computers covers a lot of territory, but by no means the\r\nwhole ball of cyberspatial wax.  If you are, for instance,\r\na LOCAL computer retailer, or the owner of a LOCAL bulletin\r\nboard system, then a malicious LOCAL intruder can break in,\r\ncrash your system, trash your files and scatter viruses,\r\nand the U.S. Secret Service cannot do a single thing about it.\r\n\r\nAt least, it can't do anything DIRECTLY.  But the Secret Service\r\nwill do plenty to help the local people who can.\r\n\r\nThe FBI may have dealt itself an ace off the bottom of the deck\r\nwhen it comes to Section 1030; but that's not the whole story;\r\nthat's not the street. What's Congress thinks is one thing,\r\nand Congress has been known to change its mind.  The REAL\r\nturf-struggle is out there in the streets where it's happening.\r\nIf you're a local street-cop with a computer problem,\r\nthe Secret Service wants you to know where you can find\r\nthe real expertise.  While the Bureau crowd are off having\r\ntheir favorite shoes polished--(wing-tips)--and making derisive\r\nfun of the Service's favorite shoes--(\"pansy-ass tassels\")--\r\nthe tassel-toting Secret Service has a crew of ready-and-able\r\nhacker-trackers installed in the capital of every state in the Union.\r\nNeed advice?  They'll give you advice, or at least point you in\r\nthe right direction.  Need training?  They can see to that, too.\r\n\r\nIf you're a local cop and you call in the FBI, the FBI\r\n(as is widely and slanderously rumored) will order you around\r\nlike a coolie, take all the credit for your busts,\r\nand mop up every possible scrap of reflected glory.\r\nThe Secret Service, on the other hand, doesn't brag a lot.\r\nThey're the quiet types. VERY quiet.  Very cool.  Efficient.\r\nHigh-tech.  Mirrorshades, icy stares, radio ear-plugs,\r\nan Uzi machine-pistol tucked somewhere in that well-cut jacket.\r\nAmerican samurai, sworn to give their lives to protect our President.\r\n\"The granite agents.\"  Trained in martial arts, absolutely fearless.\r\nEvery single one of 'em has a top-secret security clearance.\r\nSomething goes a little wrong, you're not gonna hear any whining\r\nand moaning and political buck-passing out of these guys.\r\n\r\nThe facade of the granite agent is not, of course, the reality.\r\nSecret Service agents are human beings. And the real glory\r\nin Service work is not in battling computer crime--not yet,\r\nanyway--but in protecting the President.  The real glamour\r\nof Secret Service work is in the White House Detail.\r\nIf you're at the President's side, then the kids and the wife\r\nsee you on television; you rub shoulders with the most powerful\r\npeople in the world.  That's the real heart of Service work,\r\nthe number one priority.  More than one computer investigation\r\nhas stopped dead in the water when Service agents vanished at\r\nthe President's need.\r\n\r\nThere's romance in the work of the Service.  The intimate access\r\nto circles of great power;  the esprit-de-corps of a highly trained\r\nand disciplined elite; the high responsibility of defending the\r\nChief Executive; the fulfillment of a patriotic duty.  And as police\r\nwork goes, the pay's not bad.  But there's squalor in Service work, too.\r\nYou may get spat upon by protesters howling abuse--and if they get violent,\r\nif they get too close, sometimes you have to knock one of them down--\r\ndiscreetly.\r\n\r\nThe real squalor in Service work is drudgery such as \"the quarterlies,\"\r\ntraipsing out four times a year, year in, year out, to interview the various\r\npathetic wretches, many of them in prisons and asylums, who have seen fit\r\nto threaten the President's life.  And then there's the grinding stress\r\nof searching all those faces in the endless bustling crowds, looking for\r\nhatred, looking for psychosis, looking for the tight, nervous face\r\nof an Arthur Bremer, a Squeaky Fromme, a Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\nIt's watching all those grasping, waving hands for sudden movements,\r\nwhile your ears strain at your radio headphone for the long-rehearsed\r\ncry of \"Gun!\"\r\n\r\nIt's poring, in grinding detail, over the biographies of every rotten\r\nloser who ever shot at a President.  It's the unsung work of the\r\nProtective Research Section, who study scrawled, anonymous death threats\r\nwith all the meticulous tools of anti-forgery techniques.\r\n\r\nAnd it's maintaining the hefty computerized files on anyone\r\nwho ever threatened the President's life.  Civil libertarians\r\nhave become increasingly concerned at the Government's use\r\nof computer files to track American citizens--but the\r\nSecret Service file of potential Presidential assassins,\r\nwhich has upward of twenty thousand names, rarely causes\r\na peep of protest.  If you EVER state that you intend to\r\nkill the President, the Secret Service will want to know\r\nand record who you are, where you are, what you are,\r\nand what you're up to.  If you're a serious threat--\r\nif you're officially considered \"of protective interest\"--\r\nthen the Secret Service may well keep tabs on you\r\nfor the rest of your natural life.\r\n\r\nProtecting the President has first call on all the Service's resources.\r\nBut there's a lot more to the Service's traditions and history than\r\nstanding guard outside the Oval Office.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service is the nation's oldest general federal\r\nlaw-enforcement agency.  Compared to the Secret Service,\r\nthe FBI are new-hires and the CIA are temps.  The Secret Service\r\nwas founded 'way back in 1865, at the suggestion of Hugh McCulloch,\r\nAbraham Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury.  McCulloch wanted\r\na specialized Treasury police to combat counterfeiting.\r\nAbraham Lincoln agreed that this seemed a good idea, and,\r\nwith a terrible irony, Abraham Lincoln was shot that\r\nvery night by John Wilkes Booth.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service originally had nothing to do with protecting Presidents.\r\nThey didn't take this on as a regular assignment until after the Garfield\r\nassassination in 1881.  And they didn't get any Congressional money for it\r\nuntil President McKinley was shot in 1901.  The Service was originally\r\ndesigned for one purpose: destroying counterfeiters.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThere are interesting parallels between the Service's\r\nnineteenth-century entry into counterfeiting,\r\nand America's twentieth-century entry into computer-crime.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, America's paper currency was a terrible muddle.\r\nSecurity was drastically bad.  Currency was printed on the spot\r\nby local banks in literally hundreds of different designs.\r\nNo one really knew what the heck a dollar bill was supposed to look like.\r\nBogus bills passed easily.  If some joker told you that a one-dollar bill\r\nfrom the Railroad Bank of Lowell, Massachusetts had a woman leaning on\r\na shield, with a locomotive, a cornucopia, a compass, various agricultural\r\nimplements, a railroad bridge, and some factories, then you pretty much had\r\nto take his word for it.  (And in fact he was telling the truth!)\r\n\r\nSIXTEEN HUNDRED local American banks designed and printed their own\r\npaper currency, and there were no general standards for security.\r\nLike a badly guarded node in a computer network, badly designed bills\r\nwere easy to fake, and posed a security hazard for the entire monetary system.\r\n\r\nNo one knew the exact extent of the threat to the currency.\r\nThere were panicked estimates that as much as a third of\r\nthe entire national currency was faked.  Counterfeiters--\r\nknown as \"boodlers\" in the underground slang of the time--\r\nwere mostly technically skilled printers who had gone to the bad.\r\nMany had once worked printing legitimate currency.\r\nBoodlers operated in rings and gangs.  Technical experts\r\nengraved the bogus plates--commonly in basements in New York City.\r\nSmooth confidence men passed large wads of high-quality,\r\nhigh-denomination fakes, including the really sophisticated stuff--\r\ngovernment bonds, stock certificates, and railway shares.\r\nCheaper, botched fakes were sold or sharewared to low-level\r\ngangs of boodler wannabes.  (The really cheesy lowlife boodlers\r\nmerely upgraded real bills by altering face values,\r\nchanging ones to fives, tens to hundreds, and so on.)\r\n\r\nThe techniques of boodling were little-known and regarded\r\nwith a certain awe by the mid- nineteenth-century public.\r\nThe ability to manipulate the system for rip-off seemed\r\ndiabolically clever.  As the skill and daring of the\r\nboodlers increased, the situation became intolerable.\r\nThe federal government stepped in, and began offering\r\nits own federal currency, which was printed in fancy green ink,\r\nbut only on the back--the original \"greenbacks.\"  And at first,\r\nthe improved security of the well-designed, well-printed\r\nfederal greenbacks seemed to solve the problem; but then\r\nthe counterfeiters caught on.  Within a few years things were\r\nworse than ever:  a CENTRALIZED system where ALL security was bad!\r\n\r\nThe local police were helpless.  The Government tried offering\r\nblood money to potential informants, but this met with little success.\r\nBanks, plagued by boodling, gave up hope of police help and hired\r\nprivate security men instead.  Merchants and bankers queued up\r\nby the thousands to buy privately-printed manuals on currency security,\r\nslim little books like Laban Heath's  INFALLIBLE GOVERNMENT\r\nCOUNTERFEIT DETECTOR.  The back of the book offered Laban Heath's\r\npatent microscope for five bucks.\r\n\r\nThen the Secret Service entered the picture.  The first agents\r\nwere a rough and ready crew.  Their chief was one William P. Wood,\r\na former guerilla in the Mexican War who'd won a reputation busting\r\ncontractor fraudsters for the War Department during the Civil War.\r\nWood, who was also Keeper of the Capital Prison, had a sideline\r\nas a counterfeiting expert, bagging boodlers for the federal bounty money.\r\n\r\nWood was named Chief of the new Secret Service in July 1865.\r\nThere were only ten Secret Service agents in all:  Wood himself,\r\na handful who'd worked for him in the War Department, and a few\r\nformer private investigators--counterfeiting experts--whom Wood\r\nhad won over to public service.  (The Secret Service of 1865 was\r\nmuch the size of the Chicago Computer Fraud Task Force or the\r\nArizona Racketeering Unit of 1990.)  These ten \"Operatives\"\r\nhad an additional twenty or so \"Assistant Operatives\" and \"Informants.\"\r\nBesides salary and per diem, each Secret Service employee received\r\na whopping twenty-five dollars for each boodler he captured.\r\n\r\nWood himself publicly estimated that at least HALF of America's currency\r\nwas counterfeit, a perhaps pardonable perception.  Within a year the\r\nSecret Service had arrested over 200 counterfeiters.  They busted about\r\ntwo hundred boodlers a year for four years straight.\r\n\r\nWood attributed his success to travelling fast and light, hitting the\r\nbad-guys hard, and avoiding bureaucratic baggage.  \"Because my raids\r\nwere made without military escort and I did not ask the assistance\r\nof state officers, I surprised the professional counterfeiter.\"\r\n\r\nWood's social message to the once-impudent boodlers bore an eerie ring\r\nof Sundevil:  \"It was also my purpose to convince such characters that\r\nit would no longer be healthy for them to ply their vocation without\r\nbeing handled roughly, a fact they soon discovered.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam P. Wood, the Secret Service's guerilla pioneer,\r\ndid not end well.  He succumbed to the lure of aiming for\r\nthe really big score.  The notorious Brockway Gang of New York City,\r\nheaded by William E. Brockway, the \"King of the Counterfeiters,\"\r\nhad forged a number of government bonds.  They'd passed these\r\nbrilliant fakes on the prestigious Wall Street investment\r\nfirm of Jay Cooke and Company.  The Cooke firm were frantic\r\nand offered a huge reward for the forgers' plates.\r\n\r\nLaboring diligently, Wood confiscated the plates\r\n(though not Mr. Brockway) and claimed the reward.\r\nBut the Cooke company treacherously reneged.\r\nWood got involved in a down-and-dirty lawsuit\r\nwith the Cooke capitalists.  Wood's boss,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury McCulloch, felt that\r\nWood's demands for money and glory were unseemly,\r\nand even when the reward money finally came through,\r\nMcCulloch refused to pay Wood anything.\r\nWood found himself mired in a seemingly endless\r\nround of federal suits and Congressional lobbying.\r\n\r\nWood never got his money.  And he lost his job to boot.\r\nHe resigned in 1869.\r\n\r\nWood's agents suffered, too.  On May 12, 1869, the second Chief\r\nof the Secret Service took over, and almost immediately fired\r\nmost of Wood's pioneer Secret Service agents:  Operatives,\r\nAssistants and Informants alike.  The practice of receiving $25\r\nper crook was abolished.  And the Secret Service began the long,\r\nuncertain process of thorough professionalization.\r\n\r\nWood ended badly.  He must have felt stabbed in the back.\r\nIn fact his entire organization was mangled.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, William P. Wood WAS the first head of the Secret Service.\r\nWilliam Wood was the pioneer.  People still honor his name.  Who remembers\r\nthe name of the SECOND head of the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nAs for William Brockway (also known as \"Colonel Spencer\"),\r\nhe was finally arrested by the Secret Service in 1880.\r\nHe did five years in prison, got out, and was still boodling\r\nat the age of seventy-four.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nAnyone with an interest in  Operation Sundevil--\r\nor in American computer-crime generally--\r\ncould scarcely miss the presence of Gail Thackeray,\r\nAssistant Attorney General of the State of Arizona.\r\nComputer-crime training manuals often cited\r\nThackeray's group and her work;  she was the\r\nhighest-ranking state official to specialize\r\nin computer-related offenses.  Her name had been\r\non the Sundevil press release (though modestly ranked\r\nwell after the local federal prosecuting attorney and\r\nthe head of the Phoenix Secret Service office).\r\n\r\nAs public commentary, and controversy, began to mount\r\nabout the Hacker Crackdown, this Arizonan state official\r\nbegan to take a higher and higher public profile.\r\nThough uttering almost nothing specific about\r\nthe Sundevil operation itself, she coined some\r\nof the most striking soundbites of the growing propaganda war:\r\n\"Agents are operating in good faith, and I don't think\r\nyou can say that for the hacker community,\" was one.\r\nAnother was the memorable \"I am not a mad dog prosecutor\"\r\n(Houston Chronicle, Sept 2, 1990.)  In the meantime,\r\nthe Secret Service maintained its usual extreme discretion;\r\nthe Chicago Unit, smarting from the backlash\r\nof the Steve Jackson scandal, had gone completely to earth.\r\n\r\nAs I collated my growing pile of newspaper clippings,\r\nGail Thackeray ranked as a comparative fount of public\r\nknowledge on police operations.\r\n\r\nI decided that I  had to get to know Gail Thackeray.\r\nI wrote to her at the Arizona Attorney General's Office.\r\nNot only did she kindly reply to me, but, to my astonishment,\r\nshe knew very well what \"cyberpunk\" science fiction was.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Gail Thackeray lost her job.\r\nAnd I temporarily misplaced my own career as\r\na science-fiction writer, to become a full-time\r\ncomputer-crime journalist.  In early March, 1991,\r\nI flew to Phoenix, Arizona, to interview Gail Thackeray\r\nfor my book on the hacker crackdown.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n\"Credit cards didn't used to cost anything to get,\"\r\nsays Gail Thackeray.  \"Now they cost forty bucks--\r\nand that's all just to cover the costs from RIP-OFF ARTISTS.\"\r\n\r\nElectronic nuisance criminals are parasites.\r\nOne by one they're not much harm, no big deal.\r\nBut they never come just one by one.  They come in swarms,\r\nheaps, legions, sometimes whole subcultures.  And they bite.\r\nEvery time we buy a credit card today, we lose a little financial\r\nvitality to a particular species of bloodsucker.\r\n\r\nWhat, in her expert opinion, are the worst forms of electronic crime,\r\nI ask, consulting my notes.  Is it--credit card fraud?  Breaking into\r\nATM bank machines?  Phone-phreaking?  Computer intrusions?\r\nSoftware viruses?  Access-code theft?  Records tampering?\r\nSoftware piracy?  Pornographic bulletin boards?\r\nSatellite TV piracy?  Theft of cable service?\r\nIt's a long list.  By the time I reach the end\r\nof it I feel rather depressed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" says Gail Thackeray, leaning forward over the table,\r\nher whole body gone stiff with energetic indignation,\r\n\"the biggest damage is telephone fraud.  Fake sweepstakes,\r\nfake charities. Boiler-room con operations.  You could pay off\r\nthe national debt with what these guys steal. . . .\r\nThey target old people, they get hold of credit ratings\r\nand demographics, they rip off the old and the weak.\"\r\nThe words come tumbling out of her.\r\n\r\nIt's low-tech stuff, your everyday boiler-room fraud.\r\nGrifters, conning people out of money over the phone,\r\nhave been around for decades.  This is where the word \"phony\" came from!\r\n\r\nIt's just that it's so much EASIER now, horribly facilitated by advances\r\nin technology and the byzantine structure of the modern phone system.\r\nThe same professional fraudsters do it over and over, Thackeray tells me,\r\nthey hide behind dense onion-shells of fake companies. . . fake holding\r\ncorporations nine or ten layers deep, registered all over the map.\r\nThey get a phone installed under a false name in an empty safe-house.\r\nAnd then they call-forward everything out of that phone to yet\r\nanother phone, a phone that may even be in another STATE.\r\nAnd they don't even pay the charges on their phones;\r\nafter a month or so, they just split; set up somewhere else\r\nin another Podunkville with the same seedy crew of veteran phone-crooks.\r\nThey buy or steal commercial credit card reports, slap them on the PC,\r\nhave a program pick out people over sixty-five who pay a lot to charities.\r\nA whole subculture living off this, merciless folks on the con.\r\n\r\n\"The `light-bulbs for the blind' people,\" Thackeray muses,\r\nwith a special loathing.  \"There's just no end to them.\"\r\n\r\nWe're sitting in a downtown diner in Phoenix, Arizona.\r\nIt's a tough town, Phoenix.  A state capital seeing some hard times.\r\nEven to a Texan like myself, Arizona state politics seem rather baroque.\r\nThere was, and remains, endless trouble over the Martin Luther King holiday,\r\nthe sort of stiff-necked, foot-shooting incident for which Arizona politics\r\nseem famous.  There was Evan Mecham, the eccentric Republican millionaire\r\ngovernor who was impeached, after reducing state government to a\r\nludicrous shambles.  Then there was the national Keating scandal,\r\ninvolving Arizona savings and loans, in which both of Arizona's\r\nU.S. senators, DeConcini and McCain, played sadly prominent roles.\r\n\r\nAnd the very latest is the bizarre AzScam case,\r\nin which state legislators were videotaped,\r\neagerly taking cash from an informant of the Phoenix city\r\npolice department, who was posing as a Vegas mobster.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" says Thackeray cheerfully.  \"These people are amateurs here,\r\nthey thought they were finally getting to play with the big boys.\r\nThey don't have the least idea how to take a bribe!\r\nIt's not institutional corruption.  It's not like back in Philly.\"\r\n\r\nGail Thackeray was a former prosecutor in Philadelphia.\r\nNow she's a former assistant attorney general of the State of Arizona.\r\nSince moving to Arizona in 1986, she had worked under the aegis\r\nof Steve Twist, her boss in the Attorney General's office.\r\nSteve Twist wrote Arizona's pioneering computer crime laws\r\nand naturally took an interest in seeing them enforced.\r\nIt was a snug niche, and Thackeray's Organized Crime and\r\nRacketeering Unit won a national reputation for ambition\r\nand technical knowledgeability. . . .  Until the latest\r\nelection in Arizona.  Thackeray's boss ran for the top\r\njob, and lost.  The victor, the new Attorney General,\r\napparently went to some pains to eliminate the bureaucratic\r\ntraces of his rival, including his pet group--Thackeray's group.\r\nTwelve people got their walking papers.\r\n\r\nNow Thackeray's painstakingly assembled computer lab\r\nsits gathering dust somewhere in the glass-and-concrete\r\nAttorney General's HQ on 1275 Washington Street.\r\nHer computer-crime books, her painstakingly garnered\r\nback issues of phreak and hacker zines, all bought\r\nat her own expense--are piled in boxes somewhere.\r\nThe State of Arizona is simply not particularly\r\ninterested in electronic racketeering at the moment.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of our interview, Gail Thackeray,\r\nofficially unemployed, is working out of the county\r\nsheriff's office, living on her savings, and prosecuting\r\nseveral cases--working 60-hour weeks, just as always--\r\nfor no pay at all.  \"I'm trying to train people,\"\r\nshe mutters.\r\n\r\nHalf her life seems to be spent training people--merely pointing out,\r\nto the naive and incredulous (such as myself) that this stuff\r\nis ACTUALLY GOING ON OUT THERE.  It's a small world, computer crime.\r\nA young world.  Gail Thackeray, a trim blonde Baby-Boomer who favors\r\nGrand Canyon white-water rafting to kill some slow time,\r\nis one of the world's most senior, most veteran \"hacker-trackers.\"\r\nHer mentor was Donn Parker, the California think-tank theorist\r\nwho got it all started `way back in the mid-70s, the \"grandfather\r\nof the field,\" \"the great bald eagle of computer crime.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what she has learned, Gail Thackeray teaches.  Endlessly.\r\nTirelessly.  To anybody.  To Secret Service agents and state police,\r\nat the Glynco, Georgia federal training center.  To local police,\r\non \"roadshows\" with her slide projector and notebook.\r\nTo corporate security personnel.  To journalists.  To parents.\r\n\r\nEven CROOKS look to Gail Thackeray for advice.\r\nPhone-phreaks call her at the office.  They know very\r\nwell who she is.  They pump her for information\r\non what the cops are up to, how much they know.\r\nSometimes whole CROWDS of phone phreaks,\r\nhanging out on illegal conference calls, will call Gail\r\nThackeray up.  They taunt her.  And, as always,\r\nthey boast.  Phone-phreaks, real stone phone-phreaks,\r\nsimply CANNOT SHUT UP.  They natter on for hours.\r\n\r\nLeft to themselves, they mostly talk about the intricacies\r\nof ripping-off phones; it's about as interesting as listening\r\nto hot-rodders talk about suspension and distributor-caps.\r\nThey also gossip cruelly about each other.  And when talking\r\nto Gail Thackeray, they incriminate themselves.  \"I have tapes,\"\r\nThackeray says coolly.\r\n\r\nPhone phreaks just talk like crazy.  \"Dial-Tone\" out in Alabama\r\nhas been known to spend half-an-hour simply reading stolen\r\nphone-codes aloud into voice-mail answering machines.\r\nHundreds, thousands of numbers, recited in a monotone,\r\nwithout a break--an eerie phenomenon.  When arrested,\r\nit's a rare phone phreak who doesn't inform at endless length\r\non everybody he knows.\r\n\r\nHackers are no better.  What other group of criminals,\r\nshe asks rhetorically, publishes newsletters and holds conventions?\r\nShe seems deeply nettled by the sheer brazenness of this behavior,\r\nthough to an outsider, this activity might make one wonder\r\nwhether hackers should be considered \"criminals\" at all.\r\nSkateboarders have magazines, and they trespass a lot.\r\nHot rod people have magazines and they break speed limits\r\nand sometimes kill people. . . .\r\n\r\nI ask her whether it would be any loss to society if phone phreaking\r\nand computer hacking, as hobbies, simply dried up and blew away,\r\nso that nobody ever did it again.\r\n\r\nShe seems surprised.  \"No,\" she says swiftly.  \"Maybe a little. . .\r\nin the old days. . .the MIT stuff. . . .  But there's a lot of wonderful,\r\nlegal stuff you can do with computers now, you don't have to break into\r\nsomebody else's just to learn.  You don't have that excuse.\r\nYou can learn all you like.\"\r\n\r\nDid you ever hack into a system? I ask.\r\n\r\nThe trainees do it at Glynco.  Just to demonstrate system vulnerabilities.\r\nShe's cool to the notion.  Genuinely indifferent.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of computer do you have?\"\r\n\r\n\"A Compaq 286LE,\" she mutters.\r\n\r\n\"What kind do you WISH you had?\"\r\n\r\nAt this question, the unmistakable light of true hackerdom flares in\r\nGail Thackeray's eyes.  She becomes tense, animated, the words pour out:\r\n\"An Amiga 2000 with an IBM card and Mac emulation!  The most common hacker\r\nmachines are Amigas and Commodores.  And Apples.\"  If she had the Amiga,\r\nshe enthuses, she could run a whole galaxy of seized computer-evidence disks\r\non one convenient multifunctional machine.  A cheap one, too.  Not like the\r\nold Attorney General lab, where they had an ancient CP/M machine,\r\nassorted Amiga flavors and Apple flavors, a couple IBMS, all the\r\nutility software. . .but no Commodores.  The workstations down\r\nat the Attorney General's are Wang dedicated word-processors.\r\nLame machines tied in to an office net--though at least they get\r\non- line to the Lexis and Westlaw legal data services.\r\n\r\nI don't say anything.  I recognize the syndrome, though.\r\nThis computer-fever has been running through segments of\r\nour society for years now.  It's a strange kind of lust:\r\nK-hunger, Meg-hunger; but it's a shared disease;\r\nit can kill parties dead, as conversation spirals into\r\nthe deepest and most deviant recesses of software releases\r\nand expensive peripherals. . . .  The mark of the hacker beast.\r\nI have it too.  The whole \"electronic community,\" whatever the hell\r\nthat is, has it.  Gail Thackeray has it.  Gail Thackeray is a hacker cop.\r\nMy immediate reaction is a strong rush of indignant pity:\r\nWHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY BUY THIS WOMAN HER AMIGA?!\r\nIt's not like she's asking for a Cray X-MP\r\nsupercomputer mainframe; an Amiga's a sweet little\r\ncookie-box thing.  We're losing zillions in organized fraud;\r\nprosecuting and defending a single hacker case in court can cost\r\na hundred grand easy.  How come nobody can come up with four lousy grand\r\nso this woman can do her job?  For a hundred grand we could buy every\r\ncomputer cop in America an Amiga. There aren't that many of 'em.\r\n\r\nComputers.  The lust, the hunger, for computers.\r\nThe loyalty they inspire, the intense sense of possessiveness.\r\nThe culture they have bred.  I myself am sitting in downtown Phoenix,\r\nArizona because it suddenly occurred to me that the police might--\r\njust MIGHT--come and take away my computer.  The prospect of this,\r\nthe mere IMPLIED THREAT, was unbearable.  It literally changed my life.\r\nIt was changing the lives of many others.  Eventually it would change\r\neverybody's life.\r\n\r\nGail Thackeray was one of the top computer-crime people in America.\r\nAnd I was just some novelist, and yet I had a better computer than hers.\r\nPRACTICALLY EVERYBODY I KNEW had a better computer than Gail Thackeray\r\nand her feeble laptop 286.  It was like sending the sheriff in to clean\r\nup Dodge City and arming her with a slingshot cut from an old rubber tire.\r\n\r\nBut then again, you don't need a howitzer to enforce the law.\r\nYou can do a lot just with a badge.  With a badge alone,\r\nyou can basically wreak havoc, take a terrible vengeance on wrongdoers.\r\nNinety percent of \"computer crime investigation\" is just \"crime investigation:\"\r\nnames, places, dossiers, modus operandi, search warrants, victims,\r\ncomplainants, informants. . . .\r\n\r\nWhat will computer crime look like in ten years?  Will it get better?\r\nDid \"Sundevil\" send 'em reeling back in confusion?\r\n\r\nIt'll be like it is now, only worse, she tells me with perfect conviction.\r\nStill there in the background, ticking along, changing with the times:\r\nthe criminal underworld.  It'll be like drugs are.  Like our problems\r\nwith alcohol.  All the cops and laws in the world never solved our problems\r\nwith alcohol.  If there's something people want, a certain percentage\r\nof them are just going to take it.  Fifteen percent of the populace\r\nwill never steal.  Fifteen percent will steal most anything not nailed down.\r\nThe battle is for the hearts and minds of the remaining seventy percent.\r\n\r\nAnd criminals catch on fast.  If there's not \"too steep a learning curve\"--\r\nif it doesn't require a baffling amount of expertise and practice--\r\nthen criminals are often some of the first through the gate of a\r\nnew technology.  Especially if it helps them to hide.\r\nThey have tons of cash, criminals.  The new communications tech--\r\nlike pagers, cellular phones, faxes, Federal Express--were pioneered\r\nby rich corporate people, and by criminals.  In the early years\r\nof pagers and beepers, dope dealers were so enthralled this technology\r\nthat owing a beeper was practically prima facie evidence of cocaine dealing.\r\nCB radio exploded when the speed limit hit 55 and breaking the highway law\r\nbecame a national pastime.  Dope dealers send cash by Federal Express,\r\ndespite, or perhaps BECAUSE OF, the warnings in FedEx offices that tell you\r\nnever to try this.  Fed Ex uses X-rays and dogs on their mail,\r\nto stop drug shipments.  That doesn't work very well.\r\n\r\nDrug dealers went wild over cellular phones.\r\nThere are simple methods of faking ID on cellular phones,\r\nmaking the location of the call mobile, free of charge,\r\nand effectively untraceable.  Now victimized cellular\r\ncompanies routinely bring in vast toll-lists of calls\r\nto Colombia and Pakistan.\r\n\r\nJudge Greene's fragmentation of the phone company\r\nis driving law enforcement nuts.  Four thousand\r\ntelecommunications companies.  Fraud skyrocketing.\r\nEvery temptation in the world available with a phone\r\nand a credit card number. Criminals untraceable.\r\nA galaxy of \"new neat rotten things to do.\"\r\n\r\nIf there were one thing Thackeray would like to have,\r\nit would be an effective legal end-run through this new\r\nfragmentation minefield.\r\n\r\nIt would be a new form of electronic search warrant,\r\nan \"electronic letter of marque\" to be issued by a judge.\r\nIt would create a new category of \"electronic emergency.\"\r\nLike a wiretap, its use would be rare, but it would cut\r\nacross state lines and force swift cooperation from all concerned.\r\nCellular, phone, laser, computer network, PBXes, AT&T, Baby Bells,\r\nlong-distance entrepreneurs, packet radio. Some document,\r\nsome mighty court-order, that could slice through four thousand\r\nseparate forms of corporate red-tape, and get her at once to\r\nthe source of calls, the source of email threats and viruses,\r\nthe sources of bomb threats, kidnapping threats.  \"From now on,\"\r\nshe says, \"the Lindbergh baby will always die.\"\r\n\r\nSomething that would make the Net sit still, if only for a moment.\r\nSomething that would get her up to speed.  Seven league boots.\r\nThat's what she really needs.  \"Those guys move in nanoseconds\r\nand I'm on the Pony Express.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, there's the  coming international angle.\r\nElectronic crime has never been easy to localize,\r\nto tie to a physical jurisdiction.  And phone-phreaks\r\nand hackers loathe boundaries, they jump them whenever they can.\r\nThe English.  The Dutch.  And the Germans, especially the ubiquitous\r\nChaos Computer Club.  The Australians.  They've all learned phone-phreaking\r\nfrom America.  It's a growth mischief industry.  The multinational\r\nnetworks are global, but governments and the police simply aren't.\r\nNeither are the laws.  Or the legal frameworks for citizen protection.\r\n\r\nOne language is global, though--English.  Phone phreaks speak English;\r\nit's their native tongue even if they're Germans.  English may have started\r\nin England but now it's the Net language; it might as well be called \"CNNese.\"\r\n\r\nAsians just aren't much into phone phreaking.  They're the world masters\r\nat organized software piracy.  The French aren't into phone-phreaking either.\r\nThe French are into computerized industrial espionage.\r\n\r\nIn the old days of the MIT righteous hackerdom, crashing systems\r\ndidn't hurt anybody. Not all that much, anyway.  Not permanently.\r\nNow the players are more venal.  Now the consequences are worse.\r\nHacking will begin killing people soon.  Already there are methods\r\nof stacking calls onto 911 systems, annoying the police, and possibly\r\ncausing the death of some poor soul calling in with a genuine emergency.\r\nHackers in Amtrak computers, or air-traffic control computers, will kill\r\nsomebody someday.  Maybe a lot of people.  Gail Thackeray expects it.\r\n\r\nAnd the viruses are getting nastier.  The \"Scud\" virus is the latest one out.\r\nIt wipes hard-disks.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thackeray, the idea that phone-phreaks are Robin Hoods is a fraud.\r\nThey don't deserve this repute.  Basically, they pick on the weak.  AT&T now\r\nprotects itself with the fearsome ANI (Automatic Number Identification)\r\ntrace capability.  When AT&T wised up and tightened security generally,\r\nthe phreaks drifted into the Baby Bells.  The Baby Bells lashed out in 1989\r\nand 1990, so the phreaks switched to smaller long-distance entrepreneurs.\r\nToday, they are moving into locally owned PBXes and voice-mail systems,\r\nwhich are full of security holes, dreadfully easy to hack.  These victims\r\naren't the moneybags Sheriff of Nottingham or Bad King John, but small groups\r\nof innocent people who find it hard to protect themselves, and who really\r\nsuffer from these depredations.  Phone phreaks pick on the weak.  They do it\r\nfor power.  If it were legal, they wouldn't do it.  They don't want service,\r\nor knowledge, they want the thrill of power-tripping.  There's plenty of\r\nknowledge or service around if you're willing to pay.  Phone phreaks don't pay,\r\nthey steal.  It's because it is illegal that it feels like power,\r\nthat it gratifies their vanity.\r\n\r\nI leave Gail Thackeray with a handshake at the door of her office building--\r\na vast International-Style office building downtown.  The Sheriff's office\r\nis renting part of it.  I get the vague impression that quite a lot of the\r\nbuilding is empty--real estate crash.\r\n\r\nIn a Phoenix sports apparel store, in a downtown mall, I meet\r\nthe \"Sun Devil\" himself.  He is the cartoon mascot of\r\nArizona State University, whose football stadium, \"Sundevil,\"\r\nis near the local Secret Service HQ--hence the name Operation Sundevil.\r\nThe Sun Devil himself is named \"Sparky.\"  Sparky the Sun Devil is maroon\r\nand bright yellow, the school colors.  Sparky brandishes a three-tined\r\nyellow pitchfork.  He has a small mustache, pointed ears, a barbed tail,\r\nand is dashing forward jabbing the air with the pitchfork,\r\nwith an expression of devilish glee.\r\n\r\nPhoenix was the home of Operation Sundevil.  The Legion of Doom\r\nran a hacker bulletin board called \"The Phoenix Project.\"\r\nAn Australian hacker named \"Phoenix\"  once burrowed through\r\nthe Internet to attack Cliff Stoll, then bragged and boasted\r\nabout it to The New York Times.  This net of coincidence\r\nis both odd and meaningless.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the Arizona Attorney General, Gail Thackeray's\r\nformer workplace, is on 1275 Washington Avenue.  Many of the downtown\r\nstreets in Phoenix are named after prominent American presidents:\r\nWashington, Jefferson, Madison. . . .\r\n\r\nAfter dark, all the employees go home to their suburbs.\r\nWashington, Jefferson and Madison--what would be the\r\nPhoenix inner city, if there were an inner city in this\r\nsprawling automobile-bred town--become the haunts\r\nof transients and derelicts.  The homeless.  The sidewalks\r\nalong Washington are lined with orange trees.\r\nRipe fallen fruit lies scattered like croquet balls\r\non the sidewalks and gutters.  No one seems to be eating them.\r\nI try a fresh one.  It tastes unbearably bitter.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General's office, built in 1981 during the\r\nBabbitt administration, is a long low two-story building\r\nof white cement and wall-sized sheets of curtain-glass.\r\nBehind each glass wall is a lawyer's office, quite open\r\nand visible to anyone strolling by.  Across the street\r\nis a dour government building labelled simply ECONOMIC SECURITY,\r\nsomething that has not been in great supply in the American\r\nSouthwest lately.\r\n\r\nThe offices  are about twelve feet square.  They feature\r\ntall wooden cases full of red-spined lawbooks;\r\nWang computer monitors; telephones; Post-it notes galore.\r\nAlso framed law diplomas and a general excess of bad\r\nWestern landscape art.  Ansel Adams photos are a big favorite,\r\nperhaps to compensate for the dismal specter of the parking lot,\r\ntwo acres of striped black asphalt, which features gravel landscaping\r\nand some sickly-looking barrel cacti.\r\n\r\nIt has grown dark.  Gail Thackeray has told me that the people\r\nwho work late here, are afraid of muggings in the parking lot.\r\nIt seems cruelly ironic that a woman tracing electronic racketeers\r\nacross the interstate labyrinth of Cyberspace should fear an assault\r\nby a homeless derelict in the parking lot of her own workplace.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is less than coincidence.  Perhaps these two seemingly\r\ndisparate worlds are somehow generating one another.  The poor and\r\ndisenfranchised take to the streets, while the rich and computer-equipped,\r\nsafe in their bedrooms, chatter over their modems.  Quite often the derelicts\r\nkick the glass out and break in to the lawyers' offices, if they see something\r\nthey need or want badly enough.\r\n\r\nI cross  the parking lot to the street behind the Attorney General's office.\r\nA pair of young tramps are bedding down on flattened sheets of cardboard,\r\nunder an alcove stretching over the sidewalk.  One tramp wears a\r\nglitter-covered T-shirt reading \"CALIFORNIA\" in Coca-Cola cursive.\r\nHis nose and cheeks look chafed and swollen; they glisten with\r\nwhat seems to be Vaseline.  The other tramp has a ragged long-sleeved\r\nshirt and lank brown hair parted in the middle. They both wear blue jeans\r\ncoated in grime.  They are both drunk.\r\n\r\n\"You guys crash here a lot?\" I ask them.\r\n\r\nThey look at me warily.  I am wearing black jeans, a black pinstriped\r\nsuit jacket and a black silk tie.  I have odd shoes and a funny haircut.\r\n\r\n\"It's our first time here,\" says the red-nosed tramp unconvincingly.\r\nThere is a lot of cardboard stacked here.  More than any two people could use.\r\n\r\n\"We usually stay at the Vinnie's down the street,\" says the brown-haired tramp,\r\npuffing a Marlboro with a meditative air, as he sprawls with his head on\r\na blue nylon backpack.  \"The Saint Vincent's.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know who works in that building over there?\"  I ask, pointing.\r\n\r\nThe brown-haired tramp shrugs.  \"Some kind of attorneys, it says.\"\r\n\r\nWe urge one another to take it easy.  I give them five bucks.\r\n\r\nA block down the street I meet a vigorous workman who is wheeling along\r\nsome kind of industrial trolley; it has what appears to be a tank of\r\npropane on it.\r\n\r\nWe make eye contact.  We nod politely.  I walk past him.  \"Hey!\r\nExcuse me sir!\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" I say, stopping and turning.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen,\" the guy says rapidly, \"a black guy, about 6'7\",\r\nscars on both his cheeks like this--\" he gestures-- \"wears a\r\nblack baseball cap on backwards, wandering around here anyplace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like I don't much WANT to meet him,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"He took my wallet,\" says my new acquaintance.\r\n\"Took it this morning.  Y'know, some people would be\r\nSCARED of a guy like that.  But I'm not scared.\r\nI'm from Chicago.  I'm gonna hunt him down.\r\nWe do things like that in Chicago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went to the cops and now he's got an APB out on his ass,\"\r\nhe says with satisfaction.  \"You run into him, you let me know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\" I say.  \"What is your name, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stanley. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"And how can I reach you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Stanley says, in the same rapid voice,\r\n\"you don't have to reach, uh, me.\r\nYou can just call the cops.  Go straight to the cops.\"\r\nHe reaches into a pocket and pulls out a greasy piece of pasteboard.\r\n\"See, here's my report on him.\"\r\n\r\nI look.  The \"report,\" the size of an index card, is labelled PRO-ACT:\r\nPhoenix Residents Opposing Active Crime Threat. . . . or is it\r\nOrganized Against Crime Threat?  In the darkening street it's hard\r\nto read.  Some kind of vigilante group?  Neighborhood watch?\r\nI feel very puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Are you a police officer, sir?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiles, seems very pleased by the question.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"But you are a `Phoenix Resident?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you believe a homeless person,\" Stanley says.\r\n\r\n\"Really?  But what's with the. . . .\"  For the first time I take a close look\r\nat Stanley's trolley.  It's a rubber-wheeled thing of industrial metal,\r\nbut the device I had mistaken for a tank of propane is in fact a water-cooler.\r\nStanley also has an Army duffel-bag, stuffed tight as a sausage with clothing\r\nor perhaps a tent, and, at the base of his trolley, a cardboard box and a\r\nbattered leather briefcase.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" I say, quite at a loss.  For the first time I notice that Stanley\r\nhas a wallet.  He has not lost his wallet at all.  It is in his back pocket\r\nand chained to his belt.  It's not a new wallet.  It seems to have seen\r\na lot of wear.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know how it is, brother,\" says Stanley.\r\nNow that I know that he is homeless--A POSSIBLE\r\nTHREAT--my entire perception of him has changed\r\nin an instant.  His speech, which once seemed just\r\nbright and enthusiastic, now seems to have a\r\ndangerous tang of mania.  \"I have to do this!\"\r\nhe assures me.  \"Track this guy down. . . .\r\nIt's a thing I do. . . you know. . .to keep myself together!\"\r\nHe smiles, nods, lifts his trolley by its decaying rubber handgrips.\r\n\r\n\"Gotta work together, y'know,\"  Stanley booms, his face alight\r\nwith cheerfulness, \"the police can't do everything!\"\r\nThe gentlemen I met in my stroll in downtown Phoenix\r\nare the only computer illiterates in this book.\r\nTo regard them as irrelevant, however, would be a grave mistake.\r\n\r\nAs computerization spreads across society, the populace at large\r\nis subjected to wave after wave of future shock.  But, as a\r\nnecessary converse, the \"computer community\" itself is subjected\r\nto wave after wave of incoming computer illiterates.\r\nHow will those currently enjoying America's digital bounty regard,\r\nand treat, all this teeming refuse yearning to breathe free?\r\nWill the electronic frontier be another Land of Opportunity--\r\nor an armed and monitored enclave, where the disenfranchised\r\nsnuggle on their cardboard at the locked doors of our houses of justice?\r\n\r\nSome people just don't get along with computers.  They can't read.\r\nThey can't type.  They just don't have it in their heads to master\r\narcane instructions in wirebound manuals.  Somewhere, the process\r\nof computerization of the populace will reach a limit.  Some people--\r\nquite decent people maybe, who might have thrived in any other situation--\r\nwill be left irretrievably outside the bounds.  What's to be done with\r\nthese people, in the bright new shiny electroworld?  How will they\r\nbe regarded, by the mouse-whizzing masters of cyberspace?  With contempt?\r\nIndifference?  Fear?\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, it astonishes me to realize how quickly poor Stanley\r\nbecame a perceived threat. Surprise and fear are closely allied feelings.\r\nAnd the world of computing is full of surprises.\r\n\r\nI met one character in the streets of Phoenix whose role in this book\r\nis supremely and directly relevant.  That personage was Stanley's giant\r\nthieving scarred phantom.  This phantasm is everywhere in this book.\r\nHe is the specter haunting cyberspace.\r\n\r\nSometimes he's a maniac vandal ready to smash the phone system\r\nfor no sane reason at all.  Sometimes he's a fascist fed,\r\ncoldly programming his mighty mainframes to destroy our Bill of Rights.\r\nSometimes he's a telco bureaucrat, covertly conspiring to register all modems\r\nin the service of an Orwellian surveillance regime.  Mostly, though,\r\nthis fearsome phantom is a \"hacker.\"  He's strange, he doesn't belong,\r\nhe's not authorized, he doesn't smell right, he's not keeping his proper place,\r\nhe's not one of us.  The focus of fear is the hacker, for much the same\r\nreasons that Stanley's fancied assailant is black.\r\n\r\nStanley's demon can't go away, because he doesn't exist.\r\nDespite singleminded and tremendous effort, he can't be arrested,\r\nsued, jailed, or fired.  The only constructive way to do ANYTHING\r\nabout him is to learn more about Stanley himself.  This learning process\r\nmay be repellent, it may be ugly, it may involve grave elements of paranoiac\r\nconfusion, but it's necessary.  Knowing Stanley requires something more\r\nthan class-crossing condescension.  It requires more than steely\r\nlegal objectivity.  It requires  human compassion and sympathy.\r\n\r\nTo know Stanley is to know his demon.  If you know the other guy's demon,\r\nthen maybe you'll come to know some of your own.  You'll be able to\r\nseparate reality from illusion.  And then you won't do your cause,\r\nand yourself, more harm than good.  Like poor damned Stanley from Chicago did.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe Federal Computer Investigations Committee (FCIC) is the most important\r\nand influential organization in the realm of American computer-crime.\r\nSince the police of other countries have largely taken their computer-crime\r\ncues from American methods, the FCIC might well be called the most important\r\ncomputer crime group in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is also, by federal standards, an organization of great unorthodoxy.\r\nState and local investigators mix with federal agents.  Lawyers,\r\nfinancial auditors and computer-security programmers trade notes\r\nwith street cops.  Industry vendors and telco security people show up\r\nto explain their gadgetry and plead for protection and justice.\r\nPrivate investigators, think-tank experts and industry pundits throw in\r\ntheir two cents' worth.  The FCIC is the antithesis of a formal bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nMembers of the FCIC are obscurely proud of this fact; they recognize their\r\ngroup as aberrant, but are entirely convinced that this, for them,\r\noutright WEIRD behavior is nevertheless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY\r\nto get their jobs done.\r\n\r\nFCIC regulars --from the Secret Service, the FBI, the IRS,\r\nthe Department of Labor, the offices of federal attorneys,\r\nstate police, the Air Force, from military intelligence--\r\noften attend meetings, held hither and thither across the country,\r\nat their own expense.  The FCIC doesn't get grants.  It doesn't\r\ncharge membership fees.  It doesn't have a boss.  It has no headquarters--\r\njust a mail drop in Washington DC, at the Fraud Division of the Secret Service.\r\nIt doesn't have a budget.  It doesn't have schedules.  It meets three times\r\na year--sort of.  Sometimes it issues publications, but the FCIC\r\nhas no regular publisher, no treasurer, not even a secretary.\r\nThere are no minutes of FCIC  meetings.  Non-federal people are considered\r\n\"non-voting members,\" but there's not much in the way of elections.\r\nThere are no badges, lapel pins or certificates of membership.\r\nEveryone is on a first-name basis.  There are about forty of them.\r\nNobody knows how many, exactly.  People come, people go--\r\nsometimes people \"go\" formally but still hang around anyway.\r\nNobody has ever exactly figured out what \"membership\" of this\r\n\"Committee\" actually entails.\r\n\r\nStrange as this may seem to some, to anyone familiar with the social world\r\nof computing, the \"organization\" of the FCIC is very recognizable.\r\n\r\nFor years now, economists and management theorists have speculated\r\nthat the tidal wave of the information revolution would destroy rigid,\r\npyramidal bureaucracies, where everything is top-down and\r\ncentrally controlled.  Highly trained \"employees\" would take on\r\nmuch greater autonomy, being self-starting, and self-motivating,\r\nmoving from place to place, task to task, with great speed and fluidity.\r\n\"Ad-hocracy\" would rule, with groups of people spontaneously knitting\r\ntogether across organizational lines, tackling the problem at hand,\r\napplying intense computer-aided expertise to it, and then vanishing\r\nwhence they came.\r\n\r\nThis is more or less what has actually happened in the world of\r\nfederal computer investigation.  With the conspicuous exception\r\nof the phone companies, which are after all over a hundred years old,\r\npractically EVERY organization that plays any important role in this book\r\nfunctions just like the FCIC.  The Chicago Task Force, the Arizona\r\nRacketeering Unit, the Legion of Doom, the Phrack crowd, the\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation--they ALL look and act like \"tiger teams\"\r\nor \"user's groups.\"  They are all electronic ad-hocracies leaping up\r\nspontaneously to attempt to meet a need.\r\n\r\nSome are police.  Some are, by strict definition, criminals.\r\nSome are political interest-groups.  But every single group\r\nhas that same quality of apparent spontaneity--\"Hey, gang!\r\nMy uncle's got a barn--let's put on a show!\"\r\n\r\nEvery one of these groups is embarrassed by this \"amateurism,\"\r\nand, for the sake of their public image in a world of non-computer people,\r\nthey all attempt to look as stern and formal and impressive as possible.\r\nThese electronic frontier-dwellers resemble groups of nineteenth-century\r\npioneers hankering after the respectability of statehood.\r\nThere are however, two crucial differences in the historical experience\r\nof these \"pioneers\" of the nineteeth and twenty-first centuries.\r\n\r\nFirst, powerful information technology DOES play into the hands of small,\r\nfluid, loosely organized groups.  There have always been \"pioneers,\"\r\n\"hobbyists,\" \"amateurs,\" \"dilettantes,\" \"volunteers,\" \"movements,\"\r\n\"users' groups\" and \"blue-ribbon panels of experts\" around.\r\nBut a group of this kind--when technically equipped to ship\r\nhuge amounts of specialized information, at lightning speed,\r\nto its members, to government, and to the press--is simply\r\na different kind of animal.  It's like the difference between\r\nan eel and an electric eel.\r\n\r\nThe second crucial change is that American society is currently\r\nin a state approaching permanent technological revolution.\r\nIn the world of computers particularly, it is practically impossible\r\nto EVER stop being a \"pioneer,\" unless you either drop dead or\r\ndeliberately jump off the bus.  The scene has never slowed down\r\nenough to become well-institutionalized.  And after twenty, thirty,\r\nforty years the \"computer revolution\" continues to spread,\r\nto permeate new corners of society.  Anything that really works\r\nis already obsolete.\r\n\r\nIf you spend your entire working life as a \"pioneer,\" the word \"pioneer\"\r\nbegins to lose its meaning.  Your way of life looks less and less like\r\nan introduction to something else\" more stable and organized,\r\nand more and more like JUST THE WAY THINGS ARE.  A \"permanent revolution\"\r\nis really a contradiction in terms.  If \"turmoil\"  lasts long enough,\r\nit simply becomes A NEW KIND OF SOCIETY--still the same game of history,\r\nbut new players, new rules.\r\n\r\nApply this to the world of late twentieth-century law enforcement,\r\nand the implications are  novel and puzzling indeed.  Any bureaucratic\r\nrulebook you write about computer-crime will be flawed when you write it,\r\nand almost an antique by the time it sees print.  The fluidity and fast\r\nreactions of the FCIC give them a great advantage in this regard,\r\nwhich explains their success.  Even with the best will in the world\r\n(which it does not, in fact, possess) it is impossible for an organization\r\nthe size of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to get up to speed\r\non the theory and practice of computer crime.  If they tried to train all\r\ntheir agents to do this, it would be SUICIDAL, as they would NEVER BE ABLE\r\nTO DO ANYTHING ELSE.\r\n\r\nThe FBI does try to train its agents in the basics of electronic crime,\r\nat their base in Quantico, Virginia.  And the Secret Service, along with\r\nmany other law enforcement groups, runs quite successful and well-attended\r\ntraining courses on wire fraud, business crime, and computer intrusion\r\nat the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC, pronounced \"fletsy\")\r\nin Glynco, Georgia.  But the best efforts of these bureaucracies does not\r\nremove the absolute need for a \"cutting-edge mess\" like the FCIC.\r\n\r\nFor you see--the members of FCIC ARE the trainers of the rest\r\nof law enforcement.  Practically and literally speaking,\r\nthey are the Glynco computer-crime faculty by another name.\r\nIf the FCIC went over a cliff on a bus, the U.S. law enforcement\r\ncommunity would be rendered deaf dumb and blind in the world\r\nof computer crime, and would swiftly feel a desperate need\r\nto reinvent them.  And this is no time to go starting from scratch.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 1991, I once again arrived in Phoenix, Arizona,\r\nfor the latest meeting of the Federal Computer Investigations Committee.\r\nThis was more or less the twentieth meeting of this stellar group.\r\nThe count was uncertain, since nobody could figure out whether to\r\ninclude the meetings of \"the Colluquy,\" which is what the FCIC\r\nwas called in the mid-1980s before it had even managed to obtain\r\nthe dignity of its own acronym.\r\n\r\nSince my last visit to Arizona, in May, the local AzScam bribery scandal\r\nhad resolved itself in a general muddle of humiliation.  The Phoenix chief\r\nof police, whose agents had videotaped nine state legislators up to no good,\r\nhad resigned his office in a tussle with the Phoenix city council over\r\nthe propriety of his undercover operations.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix Chief could now join Gail Thackeray and eleven of her closest\r\nassociates in the shared experience of politically motivated unemployment.\r\nAs of June, resignations were still continuing at the Arizona Attorney\r\nGeneral's office, which could be interpreted as either a New Broom\r\nSweeping Clean or a Night of the Long Knives Part II, depending on\r\nyour point of view.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of FCIC was held at the Scottsdale Hilton Resort.\r\nScottsdale is a wealthy suburb of Phoenix, known as \"Scottsdull\"\r\nto scoffing local trendies, but well-equipped with posh shopping-malls\r\nand manicured lawns, while conspicuously undersupplied with homeless derelicts.\r\nThe Scottsdale Hilton Resort was a sprawling hotel in postmodern\r\ncrypto-Southwestern style.  It featured a \"mission bell tower\"\r\nplated in turquoise tile and vaguely resembling a Saudi minaret.\r\n\r\nInside it was all barbarically striped Santa Fe Style decor.\r\nThere was a health spa downstairs and a large oddly-shaped\r\npool in the patio.  A poolside umbrella-stand offered Ben and Jerry's\r\npolitically correct Peace Pops.\r\n\r\nI registered as a member of FCIC, attaining a handy discount rate,\r\nthen went in search of the Feds.  Sure enough, at the back of the\r\nhotel grounds came the unmistakable sound of Gail Thackeray\r\nholding forth.\r\n\r\nSince I had also attended the Computers Freedom and Privacy conference\r\n(about which more later), this was the second time I had seen Thackeray\r\nin a group of her law enforcement colleagues.  Once again I was struck\r\nby how simply pleased they seemed to see her.  It was natural that she'd\r\nget SOME attention, as Gail was one of two women in a group of some thirty men;\r\nbut there was a lot more to it than that.\r\n\r\nGail Thackeray personifies the social glue of the FCIC.  They could give\r\na damn about her losing her job with the Attorney General.  They were sorry\r\nabout it, of course, but hell, they'd all lost jobs.  If they were the kind\r\nof guys who liked steady boring jobs, they would never have gotten into\r\ncomputer work in the first place.\r\n\r\nI wandered into her circle and was immediately introduced to five strangers.\r\nThe conditions of my visit at FCIC were reviewed.  I would not quote\r\nanyone directly.  I would not tie opinions expressed to the agencies\r\nof the attendees.  I would not (a purely hypothetical example)\r\nreport the conversation of a guy from the Secret Service talking\r\nquite civilly to  a guy from the FBI, as these two agencies NEVER\r\ntalk to each other, and the IRS (also present, also hypothetical)\r\nNEVER TALKS TO ANYBODY.\r\n\r\nWorse yet, I was forbidden to attend the first conference.  And I didn't.\r\nI have no idea what the FCIC was up to behind closed doors that afternoon.\r\nI rather suspect that they were engaging in a frank and thorough confession\r\nof their errors, goof-ups and blunders, as this has been a feature of every\r\nFCIC meeting since their legendary Memphis beer-bust of 1986.  Perhaps the\r\nsingle greatest attraction of FCIC is that it is a place where you can go,\r\nlet your hair down, and completely level with people who actually comprehend\r\nwhat you are talking about.  Not only do they understand you, but they\r\nREALLY PAY ATTENTION, they are GRATEFUL FOR YOUR INSIGHTS, and they\r\nFORGIVE YOU, which in nine cases out of ten is something even your\r\nboss can't do, because as soon as you start talking \"ROM,\" \"BBS,\"\r\nor \"T-1 trunk,\" his eyes glaze over.\r\n\r\nI had nothing much to do that afternoon.  The FCIC were beavering away\r\nin their conference room.  Doors were firmly closed, windows too dark\r\nto peer through.  I wondered what a real hacker, a computer intruder,\r\nwould do at a meeting like this.\r\n\r\nThe answer came at once.  He would \"trash\" the place.  Not reduce the place\r\nto trash in some orgy of vandalism; that's not the use of the term in the\r\nhacker milieu.  No, he would quietly EMPTY THE TRASH BASKETS and silently\r\nraid any valuable data indiscreetly thrown away.\r\n\r\nJournalists have been known to do this.  (Journalists hunting information\r\nhave been known to do almost every single unethical thing that hackers\r\nhave ever done.  They also throw in a few awful techniques all their own.)\r\nThe legality of `trashing' is somewhat dubious but it is not in fact\r\nflagrantly illegal.  It was, however, absurd to contemplate trashing the FCIC.\r\nThese people knew all about trashing.  I wouldn't last fifteen seconds.\r\n\r\nThe idea sounded interesting, though.  I'd been hearing a lot about\r\nthe practice lately.  On the spur of the moment, I decided I would try\r\ntrashing the office ACROSS THE HALL from the FCIC, an area which had\r\nnothing to do with the investigators.\r\n\r\nThe office was tiny; six chairs, a table. . . .  Nevertheless, it was open,\r\nso I dug around in its plastic trash can.\r\n\r\nTo my utter astonishment, I came up with the torn scraps of a SPRINT\r\nlong-distance phone bill. More digging produced a bank statement\r\nand the scraps of a hand-written letter, along with gum, cigarette ashes,\r\ncandy wrappers and a day-old-issue of USA TODAY.\r\n\r\nThe trash went back in its receptacle while the scraps of data went into\r\nmy travel bag.  I detoured through the hotel souvenir shop for some\r\nScotch tape and went up to my room.\r\n\r\nCoincidence or not, it was quite true.  Some poor soul had, in fact,\r\nthrown a SPRINT bill into the hotel's trash.  Date May 1991,\r\ntotal amount due: $252.36.  Not a business phone, either,\r\nbut a residential bill, in the name of someone called Evelyn\r\n(not her real name).  Evelyn's records showed a ## PAST DUE BILL ##!\r\nHere was her nine-digit account ID.  Here was a stern computer-printed warning:\r\n\r\n\"TREAT YOUR FONCARD AS YOU WOULD ANY CREDIT CARD.  TO SECURE AGAINST FRAUD,\r\nNEVER GIVE YOUR FONCARD NUMBER OVER THE PHONE UNLESS YOU INITIATED THE CALL.\r\nIF YOU RECEIVE SUSPICIOUS CALLS PLEASE NOTIFY CUSTOMER SERVICE IMMEDIATELY!\"\r\n\r\nI examined my watch.  Still plenty of time left for the FCIC to carry on.\r\nI sorted out the scraps of Evelyn's SPRINT bill and re-assembled them with\r\nfresh Scotch tape.  Here was her ten-digit FONCARD number.  Didn't seem\r\nto have the ID number necessary to cause real fraud trouble.\r\n\r\nI did, however, have Evelyn's home phone number.  And the phone numbers\r\nfor a whole crowd of Evelyn's long-distance friends and acquaintances.\r\nIn San Diego, Folsom, Redondo, Las Vegas, La Jolla, Topeka, and Northampton\r\nMassachusetts.  Even somebody in Australia!\r\n\r\nI examined other documents.  Here was a bank statement.  It was Evelyn's\r\nIRA account down at a bank in San Mateo California (total balance $1877.20).\r\nHere was a charge-card bill for $382.64. She was paying it off bit by bit.\r\n\r\nDriven by motives that were completely unethical and prurient,\r\nI now examined the handwritten notes.  They had been torn fairly\r\nthoroughly, so much so that it took me almost an entire five minutes\r\nto reassemble them.\r\n\r\nThey were drafts of a love letter.  They had been written on\r\nthe lined stationery of Evelyn's employer, a biomedical company.\r\nProbably written at work when she should have been doing something else.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Bob,\" (not his real name)  \"I guess in everyone's life there comes\r\na time when hard decisions have to be made, and this is a difficult one\r\nfor me--very upsetting.  Since you haven't called me, and I don't understand\r\nwhy, I can only surmise it's because you don't want to.  I thought I would\r\nhave heard from you Friday.  I did have a few unusual problems with my phone\r\nand possibly you tried, I hope so.\r\n\r\n\"Robert, you asked me to `let go'. . . .\"\r\n\r\nThe first note ended.  UNUSUAL PROBLEMS WITH HER PHONE?\r\nI looked swiftly at the next note.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, not hearing from you for the whole weekend has left me very perplexed. . . .\"\r\n\r\nNext draft.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Bob, there is so much I don't understand right now, and I wish I did.\r\nI wish I could talk to you, but for some unknown reason you have elected not\r\nto call--this is so difficult for me to understand. . . .\"\r\n\r\nShe tried again.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, Since I have always held you in such high esteem, I had every hope that\r\nwe could remain good friends, but now one essential ingredient is missing--\r\nrespect.  Your ability to discard people when their purpose is served is\r\nappalling to me.  The kindest thing you could do for me now is to leave me\r\nalone.  You are no longer welcome in my heart or home. . . .\"\r\n\r\nTry again.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, I wrote a very factual note to you to say how much respect I had lost\r\nfor you, by the way you treat people, me in particular, so uncaring and cold.\r\nThe kindest thing you can do for me is to leave me alone entirely,\r\nas you are no longer welcome in my heart or home.  I would appreciate it\r\nif you could retire your debt to me as soon as possible--I wish no link\r\nto you in any way.  Sincerely, Evelyn.\"\r\n\r\nGood heavens, I thought, the bastard actually owes her money!\r\nI turned to the next page.\r\n\r\n\"Bob:  very simple.  GOODBYE!  No more mind games--no more fascination--\r\nno more coldness--no more respect for you!  It's over--Finis.  Evie\"\r\n\r\nThere were two versions of the final brushoff letter, but they read about\r\nthe same.  Maybe she hadn't sent it.  The final item in my illicit and\r\nshameful booty was an envelope addressed to \"Bob\" at his home address,\r\nbut it had no stamp on it and it hadn't been mailed.\r\n\r\nMaybe she'd just been blowing off steam because her rascal boyfriend\r\nhad neglected to call her one weekend.  Big deal.  Maybe they'd kissed\r\nand made up, maybe she and Bob were down at Pop's Chocolate Shop now,\r\nsharing a malted.  Sure.\r\n\r\nEasy to find out.  All I had to do was call Evelyn up.  With a half-clever\r\nstory and enough brass-plated gall I could probably trick the truth out of her.\r\nPhone-phreaks and hackers deceive people over the phone all the time.\r\nIt's called \"social engineering.\" Social engineering is a very common practice\r\nin the underground, and almost magically effective.  Human beings are almost\r\nalways the weakest link in computer security.  The simplest way to learn\r\nThings You Are Not Meant To Know is simply to call up and exploit the\r\nknowledgeable people.  With social engineering, you use the bits of specialized\r\nknowledge you already have as a key, to manipulate people into believing\r\nthat you are legitimate.  You can then coax, flatter, or frighten them into\r\nrevealing almost anything you want to know.  Deceiving people (especially\r\nover the phone) is easy and fun. Exploiting their gullibility is very\r\ngratifying; it makes you feel very superior to them.\r\n\r\nIf I'd been a  malicious hacker on a trashing raid, I would now have Evelyn\r\nvery much in my power.  Given all this inside data, it wouldn't take much\r\neffort at all to invent a convincing lie.  If I were ruthless enough,\r\nand jaded enough, and clever enough, this momentary indiscretion of hers--\r\nmaybe committed in tears, who knows--could cause her a whole world of\r\nconfusion and grief.\r\n\r\nI didn't even have to have a MALICIOUS motive.  Maybe I'd be \"on her side,\"\r\nand call up Bob instead, and anonymously threaten to break both his kneecaps\r\nif he didn't take Evelyn out for a steak dinner pronto.  It was still\r\nprofoundly NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  To have gotten this knowledge at all\r\nwas a sordid act and to use it would be to inflict a sordid injury.\r\n\r\nTo do all these awful things would require exactly zero high-tech expertise.\r\nAll it would take was the willingness to do it and a certain amount\r\nof bent imagination.\r\n\r\nI went back downstairs. The hard-working FCIC, who had labored forty-five\r\nminutes over their schedule, were through for the day, and adjourned to the\r\nhotel bar.  We all had a beer.\r\n\r\nI had a chat with a guy about \"Isis,\" or rather IACIS,\r\nthe International Association of Computer Investigation Specialists.\r\nThey're into \"computer forensics,\" the techniques of picking computer-\r\nsystems apart without destroying vital evidence.  IACIS, currently run\r\nout of Oregon, is comprised of investigators in the U.S., Canada, Taiwan\r\nand Ireland.  \"Taiwan and Ireland?\"  I said.  Are TAIWAN and IRELAND\r\nreally in the forefront of this stuff?  Well not exactly, my informant\r\nadmitted.  They just happen to have been the first ones to have caught\r\non by word of mouth.  Still, the international angle counts, because this\r\nis obviously an international problem.  Phone-lines go everywhere.\r\n\r\nThere was a Mountie here from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\r\nHe seemed to be having quite a good time.  Nobody had flung this\r\nCanadian out because he might pose a foreign security risk.\r\nThese are cyberspace cops.  They still worry a lot about \"jurisdictions,\"\r\nbut mere geography is the least of their troubles.\r\n\r\nNASA had failed to show.  NASA suffers a lot from computer intrusions,\r\nin particular from Australian raiders and a well-trumpeted Chaos\r\nComputer Club case, and in 1990 there was a brief press flurry\r\nwhen it was revealed that one of NASA's Houston branch-exchanges\r\nhad been systematically ripped off by a gang of phone-phreaks.\r\nBut the NASA guys had had their funding cut.  They were stripping everything.\r\n\r\nAir Force OSI, its Office of Special Investigations, is the ONLY federal\r\nentity dedicated full-time to computer security.  They'd been expected\r\nto show up in force, but some of them had cancelled--a Pentagon budget pinch.\r\n\r\nAs the empties piled up, the guys began joshing around and telling war-stories.\r\n\"These are cops,\" Thackeray said tolerantly.  \"If they're not talking shop\r\nthey talk about women and beer.\"\r\n\r\nI heard the story about the guy who, asked for \"a copy\" of a computer disk,\r\nPHOTOCOPIED THE LABEL ON IT.  He put the floppy disk onto the glass plate\r\nof a photocopier.  The blast of static when the copier worked completely\r\nerased all the real information on the disk.\r\n\r\nSome other poor souls threw a whole bag of confiscated diskettes\r\ninto the squad-car trunk next to the police radio.  The powerful radio\r\nsignal blasted them, too.\r\n\r\nWe heard a bit about Dave Geneson, the first computer prosecutor,\r\na mainframe-runner in Dade County, turned lawyer.  Dave Geneson\r\nwas one guy who had hit the ground running, a signal virtue\r\nin making the transition to computer-crime.  It was generally\r\nagreed that it was easier to learn the world of computers first,\r\nthen police or prosecutorial work.  You could take certain computer\r\npeople and train 'em to successful police work--but of course they\r\nhad to have the COP MENTALITY.  They had to have street smarts.\r\nPatience.  Persistence.  And discretion.  You've got to make sure\r\nthey're not hot-shots, show-offs, \"cowboys.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the folks in the bar had backgrounds in military intelligence,\r\nor drugs, or homicide.  It was rudely opined that \"military intelligence\"\r\nwas a contradiction in terms, while even the grisly world of homicide\r\nwas considered cleaner than drug enforcement.  One guy had been 'way\r\nundercover doing dope-work in Europe for four years straight.\r\n\"I'm almost recovered now,\" he said deadpan, with the acid black humor\r\nthat is pure cop.  \"Hey, now I can say FUCKER without putting MOTHER\r\nin front of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the cop world,\" another guy said earnestly, \"everything is good and bad,\r\nblack and white.  In the computer world everything is gray.\"\r\n\r\nOne guy--a founder of the FCIC, who'd been with the group\r\nsince it was just the Colluquy--described his own introduction\r\nto the field.  He'd been a Washington DC homicide guy called in\r\non a \"hacker\" case.  From the word \"hacker,\" he naturally assumed\r\nhe was on the trail of a knife-wielding marauder, and went to the\r\ncomputer center expecting blood and a body.  When he finally figured\r\nout what was happening there (after loudly demanding, in vain,\r\nthat the programmers \"speak English\"), he called headquarters\r\nand told them he was clueless about computers.  They told him nobody\r\nelse knew diddly either, and to get the hell back to work.\r\n\r\nSo, he said, he had proceeded by comparisons.  By analogy.  By metaphor.\r\n\"Somebody broke in to your computer, huh?\"  Breaking and entering;\r\nI can understand that.  How'd he get in?  \"Over the phone-lines.\"\r\nHarassing phone-calls, I can understand that!  What we need here\r\nis a tap and a trace!\r\n\r\nIt worked.  It was better than nothing.  And it worked a lot faster\r\nwhen he got hold of another cop who'd done something similar.\r\nAnd then the two of them got another, and another, and pretty soon\r\nthe Colluquy was a happening thing.  It helped a lot that everybody\r\nseemed to know Carlton Fitzpatrick, the data-processing trainer in Glynco.\r\n\r\nThe ice broke big-time in Memphis in '86.  The Colluquy had attracted\r\na bunch of new guys--Secret Service, FBI, military, other feds, heavy guys.\r\nNobody wanted to tell anybody anything.  They suspected that if word got back\r\nto the home office they'd all be fired.  They passed an uncomfortably\r\nguarded afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe formalities got them nowhere.  But after the formal session was over,\r\nthe organizers brought in a case of beer.  As soon as the participants\r\nknocked it off with the bureaucratic ranks and turf-fighting, everything\r\nchanged.  \"I bared my soul,\" one veteran reminisced proudly.  By nightfall\r\nthey were building pyramids of empty beer-cans and doing everything\r\nbut composing a team fight song.\r\n\r\nFCIC were not the only computer-crime people around.  There was DATTA\r\n(District Attorneys' Technology Theft Association), though they mostly\r\nspecialized in chip theft, intellectual property, and black-market cases.\r\nThere was HTCIA  (High Tech Computer Investigators Association),\r\nalso out in Silicon Valley, a year older than FCIC and featuring\r\nbrilliant people like Donald Ingraham.  There was LEETAC\r\n(Law Enforcement Electronic Technology Assistance Committee)\r\nin Florida, and computer-crime units in Illinois and Maryland\r\nand Texas and Ohio and Colorado and Pennsylvania.  But these were\r\nlocal groups.  FCIC were the first to really network nationally\r\nand on a federal level.\r\n\r\nFCIC people live on the phone lines.  Not on bulletin board systems--\r\nthey know very well what boards are, and they know that boards aren't secure.\r\nEveryone in the FCIC has a voice-phone bill like you wouldn't believe.\r\nFCIC people have been tight with the telco people for a long time.\r\nTelephone cyberspace is their native habitat.\r\n\r\nFCIC has three basic sub-tribes:  the trainers, the security people,\r\nand the investigators.  That's why it's called an \"Investigations\r\nCommittee\" with no mention of the term \"computer-crime\"--the dreaded\r\n\"C-word.\"  FCIC, officially, is \"an association of agencies rather\r\nthan individuals;\" unofficially, this field is small enough that\r\nthe influence of individuals and individual expertise is paramount.\r\nAttendance is by invitation only, and most everyone in FCIC considers\r\nhimself a prophet without honor in his own house.\r\n\r\nAgain and again I heard this, with different terms but identical\r\nsentiments.  \"I'd been sitting in the wilderness talking to myself.\"\r\n\"I was totally isolated.\"  \"I was desperate.\"  \"FCIC is the best\r\nthing there is about computer crime in America.\"  \"FCIC is what\r\nreally works.\"  \"This is where you hear real people telling you\r\nwhat's really happening out there, not just lawyers picking nits.\"\r\n\"We taught each other everything we knew.\"\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of these statements convinces me that this is true.\r\nFCIC is the real thing and it is invaluable.  It's also very sharply\r\nat odds with the rest of the traditions and power structure\r\nin American law enforcement.  There probably  hasn't been anything\r\naround as loose and go-getting as the FCIC since the start of the\r\nU.S. Secret Service in the 1860s.  FCIC people are living like\r\ntwenty-first-century people in a twentieth-century environment,\r\nand while there's a great deal to be said for that, there's also\r\na great deal to be said against it, and those against it happen\r\nto control the budgets.\r\n\r\nI listened to two FCIC guys from Jersey compare life histories.\r\nOne of them had been a biker in a fairly heavy-duty gang in the 1960s.\r\n\"Oh, did you know so-and-so?\" said the other guy from Jersey.\r\n\"Big guy, heavyset?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I knew him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, he was one of ours.  He was our plant in the gang.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?  Wow!  Yeah, I knew him.  Helluva guy.\"\r\n\r\nThackeray reminisced at length about being tear-gassed blind\r\nin the November 1969 antiwar protests in Washington Circle,\r\ncovering them for her college paper.  \"Oh yeah, I was there,\"\r\nsaid another cop.  \"Glad to hear that tear gas hit somethin'.\r\nHaw haw haw.\"  He'd been so blind himself, he confessed,\r\nthat later that day he'd arrested a small tree.\r\n\r\nFCIC are an odd group, sifted out by coincidence and necessity,\r\nand turned into a new kind of cop.  There are a lot of specialized\r\ncops in the world--your bunco guys, your drug guys, your tax guys,\r\nbut the only group that matches FCIC for sheer isolation are probably\r\nthe child-pornography people.  Because they both deal with conspirators\r\nwho are desperate to exchange forbidden data and also desperate to hide;\r\nand because nobody else in law enforcement even wants to hear about it.\r\n\r\nFCIC people tend to change jobs a lot.  They tend not to get the equipment\r\nand training they want and need.  And they tend to get sued quite often.\r\n\r\nAs the night wore on and a band set up in the bar, the talk grew darker.\r\nNothing ever gets done in government, someone opined, until there's\r\na DISASTER.  Computing disasters are awful, but there's no denying\r\nthat they greatly help the credibility of FCIC people.  The Internet Worm,\r\nfor instance.  \"For years we'd been warning about that--but it's nothing\r\ncompared to what's coming.\"  They expect horrors, these people.\r\nThey know that nothing will really get done until there is a horror.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nNext day we heard an extensive briefing from a guy who'd been a computer cop,\r\ngotten into hot water with an Arizona city council, and now installed\r\ncomputer networks for a living (at a considerable rise in pay).\r\nHe talked about pulling fiber-optic networks apart.\r\n\r\nEven a single computer, with enough peripherals, is a literal\r\n\"network\"--a bunch of machines all cabled together, generally\r\nwith a complexity that puts stereo units to shame.  FCIC people\r\ninvent and publicize  methods of seizing computers and maintaining\r\ntheir evidence.  Simple things, sometimes, but vital rules of thumb\r\nfor street cops, who nowadays often stumble across a busy computer\r\nin the midst of a drug investigation or a white-collar bust.\r\nFor instance:  Photograph the system before you touch it.\r\nLabel the ends of all the cables before you detach anything.\r\n\"Park\" the heads on the disk drives before you move them.\r\nGet the diskettes.  Don't put the diskettes in magnetic fields.\r\nDon't write on diskettes with ballpoint pens.  Get the manuals.\r\nGet the printouts.  Get the handwritten notes.  Copy data before\r\nyou look at it, and then examine the copy instead of the original.\r\n\r\nNow our lecturer distributed copied diagrams of a typical LAN\r\nor \"Local Area Network\", which happened to be out of Connecticut.\r\nONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-NINE desktop computers, each with its own\r\nperipherals.  Three \"file servers.\"  Five \"star couplers\"\r\neach with thirty-two ports.  One sixteen-port coupler\r\noff in the corner office.  All these machines talking to each other,\r\ndistributing electronic mail, distributing software, distributing,\r\nquite possibly, criminal evidence.  All linked by high-capacity\r\nfiber-optic cable.  A bad guy--cops talk a about \"bad guys\"\r\n--might be lurking on PC #47 lot or #123 and distributing\r\nhis ill doings onto some dupe's \"personal\" machine in\r\nanother office--or another floor--or, quite possibly,\r\ntwo or three miles away!  Or, conceivably, the evidence might\r\nbe \"data-striped\"--split up into meaningless slivers stored,\r\none by one, on a whole crowd of different disk drives.\r\n\r\nThe lecturer challenged us for solutions.  I for one was utterly clueless.\r\nAs far as I could figure, the Cossacks were at the gate; there were probably\r\nmore disks in this single building than were seized during the entirety\r\nof Operation Sundevil.\r\n\r\n\"Inside informant,\" somebody said.  Right.  There's always the human angle,\r\nsomething easy to forget when contemplating the arcane recesses of high\r\ntechnology.  Cops are skilled at getting people to talk, and computer people,\r\ngiven a chair and some sustained attention, will talk about their computers\r\ntill their throats go raw.  There's a case on record of a single question--\r\n\"How'd you do it?\"--eliciting a forty-five-minute videotaped confession\r\nfrom a computer criminal who not only completely incriminated himself\r\nbut drew helpful diagrams.\r\n\r\nComputer people talk.  Hackers BRAG.  Phone-phreaks\r\ntalk PATHOLOGICALLY--why else are they stealing phone-codes,\r\nif not to natter for ten hours straight to their friends\r\non an opposite seaboard?  Computer-literate people do\r\nin fact possess an arsenal of nifty gadgets and techniques\r\nthat would allow them to conceal all kinds of exotic skullduggery,\r\nand if they could only SHUT UP about it, they could probably\r\nget away with all manner of amazing information-crimes.\r\nBut that's just not how it works--or at least,\r\nthat's not how it's worked SO FAR.\r\n\r\nMost every phone-phreak ever busted has swiftly implicated his mentors,\r\nhis disciples, and his friends.  Most every white-collar computer-criminal,\r\nsmugly convinced that his clever scheme is bulletproof, swiftly learns\r\notherwise when, for the first time in his life, an actual no-kidding\r\npoliceman leans over, grabs the front of his shirt, looks him right\r\nin the eye and says:  \"All right, ASSHOLE--you and me are going downtown!\"\r\nAll the hardware in the world will not insulate your nerves from\r\nthese actual real-life sensations of terror and guilt.\r\n\r\nCops know ways to get from point A to point Z without thumbing\r\nthrough every letter in some smart-ass bad-guy's alphabet.\r\nCops know how to cut to the chase.  Cops know a lot of things\r\nother people don't know.\r\n\r\nHackers know a lot of things other people don't know, too.\r\nHackers know, for instance, how to sneak into your computer\r\nthrough the phone-lines.  But cops can show up RIGHT ON YOUR DOORSTEP\r\nand carry off YOU and your computer in separate steel boxes.\r\nA cop interested in hackers can grab them and grill them.\r\nA hacker interested in cops has to depend on hearsay,\r\nunderground legends, and what cops are willing to publicly reveal.\r\nAnd the Secret Service didn't get named \"the SECRET Service\"\r\nbecause they blab a lot.\r\n\r\nSome people, our lecturer informed us, were under the mistaken\r\nimpression that it was \"impossible\" to tap a fiber-optic line.\r\nWell, he announced, he and his son had just whipped up a\r\nfiber-optic tap in his workshop at home.  He passed it around\r\nthe audience, along with a circuit-covered LAN plug-in card\r\nso we'd all recognize one if we saw it on a case.  We all had a look.\r\n\r\nThe tap was a classic \"Goofy Prototype\"--a thumb-length rounded\r\nmetal cylinder with a pair of plastic brackets on it.\r\nFrom one end dangled three thin black cables, each of which ended\r\nin a tiny black plastic cap.  When you plucked the safety-cap\r\noff the end of a cable, you could see the glass fiber--\r\nno thicker than a pinhole.\r\n\r\nOur lecturer informed us that the metal cylinder was a\r\n\"wavelength division multiplexer.\"  Apparently, what one did\r\nwas to cut the fiber-optic cable, insert two of the legs into\r\nthe cut to complete the network again, and then read any passing data\r\non the line by hooking up the third leg to some kind of monitor.\r\nSounded simple enough.  I wondered why nobody had thought of it before.\r\nI also wondered whether this guy's son back at the workshop had any\r\nteenage friends.\r\n\r\nWe had a break.  The guy sitting next to me was wearing a giveaway\r\nbaseball cap advertising the Uzi submachine gun.  We had a desultory chat\r\nabout the merits of Uzis.  Long a favorite of the Secret Service,\r\nit seems Uzis went out of fashion with the advent of the Persian Gulf War,\r\nour Arab allies taking some offense at Americans toting Israeli weapons.\r\nBesides, I was informed by another expert, Uzis jam.  The equivalent weapon\r\nof choice today is the Heckler & Koch, manufactured in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe guy with the Uzi cap was a forensic photographer.  He also did a lot\r\nof photographic surveillance work in computer crime cases.  He used to,\r\nthat is, until the firings in Phoenix.  He was now a private investigator and,\r\nwith his wife, ran a photography salon specializing in weddings and portrait\r\nphotos.  At--one must repeat--a considerable rise in income.\r\n\r\nHe was still FCIC.  If you were FCIC, and you needed to talk\r\nto an expert about forensic photography, well, there he was,\r\nwilling and able.  If he hadn't shown up, people would have missed him.\r\n\r\nOur lecturer had raised the point that preliminary investigation\r\nof a computer system is vital before any seizure is undertaken.\r\nIt's vital to understand how many machines are in there, what kinds\r\nthere are, what kind of operating system they use, how many people\r\nuse them, where the actual data itself is stored.  To simply barge into\r\nan office demanding \"all the computers\" is a recipe for swift disaster.\r\n\r\nThis entails some discreet inquiries beforehand.  In fact, what it\r\nentails is basically undercover work.  An intelligence operation.\r\nSPYING, not to put too fine a point on it.\r\n\r\nIn a chat after the lecture, I asked an attendee whether \"trashing\" might work.\r\n\r\nI received a swift briefing on the theory and practice of \"trash covers.\"\r\nPolice \"trash covers,\" like \"mail covers\" or like wiretaps, require the\r\nagreement of a judge.  This obtained, the \"trashing\" work of cops is just\r\nlike that of hackers, only more so and much better organized.  So much so,\r\nI was informed, that mobsters in Phoenix make extensive use of locked\r\ngarbage cans picked up by a specialty high-security trash company.\r\n\r\nIn one case, a tiger team of Arizona cops had trashed a local residence\r\nfor four months.  Every week they showed up on the municipal garbage truck,\r\ndisguised as garbagemen, and carried the contents of the suspect cans off\r\nto a shade tree, where they combed through the garbage--a messy task,\r\nespecially considering that one of the occupants was undergoing\r\nkidney dialysis.  All useful documents were cleaned, dried and examined.\r\nA discarded typewriter-ribbon was an especially valuable source of data,\r\nas its long one-strike ribbon of film contained the contents of every\r\nletter mailed out of the house.  The letters were neatly retyped by\r\na police secretary equipped with a large desk-mounted magnifying glass.\r\n\r\nThere is something weirdly disquieting about the whole subject of\r\n\"trashing\"-- an unsuspected and indeed rather disgusting mode of\r\ndeep personal vulnerability.  Things that we pass by every day,\r\nthat we take utterly for granted, can be exploited with so little work.\r\nOnce discovered, the knowledge of these vulnerabilities tend to spread.\r\n\r\nTake the lowly subject of MANHOLE COVERS.  The humble manhole cover\r\nreproduces many of the dilemmas of computer-security in miniature.\r\nManhole covers are, of course, technological artifacts, access-points\r\nto our buried urban infrastructure.  To the vast majority of us,\r\nmanhole covers are invisible.  They are also vulnerable.  For many years now,\r\nthe Secret Service has made a point of caulking manhole covers along all routes\r\nof the Presidential motorcade.  This is, of course, to deter terrorists from\r\nleaping out of underground ambush or, more likely, planting remote-control\r\ncar-smashing bombs beneath the street.\r\n\r\nLately, manhole covers have seen more and more criminal exploitation,\r\nespecially in New York City.  Recently, a telco in New York City\r\ndiscovered that a cable television service had been sneaking into\r\ntelco manholes and installing cable service alongside the phone-lines--\r\nWITHOUT PAYING ROYALTIES.  New York companies have also suffered a\r\ngeneral plague of (a) underground copper cable theft; (b) dumping of garbage,\r\nincluding toxic waste, and (c) hasty dumping of murder victims.\r\n\r\nIndustry complaints reached the ears of an innovative New England\r\nindustrial-security company, and the result was a new product known\r\nas \"the Intimidator,\" a thick titanium-steel bolt with a precisely machined\r\nhead that requires a special device to unscrew.  All these \"keys\" have registered\r\nserial numbers kept on file with the manufacturer.  There are now some\r\nthousands of these \"Intimidator\" bolts being sunk into American pavements\r\nwherever our President passes, like some macabre parody of strewn roses.\r\nThey are also spreading as fast as steel dandelions around US military bases\r\nand many centers of private industry.\r\n\r\nQuite likely it has never occurred to you to  peer under a manhole cover,\r\nperhaps climb down and walk around down there with a flashlight, just to see\r\nwhat it's like.  Formally speaking, this might be trespassing, but if you\r\ndidn't hurt anything, and didn't make an absolute habit of it, nobody would\r\nreally care.  The freedom to sneak under manholes was likely a freedom\r\nyou never intended to exercise.\r\n\r\nYou now are rather less likely to have that freedom at all.\r\nYou may never even have missed it until you read about it here,\r\nbut if you're in New York City it's gone, and elsewhere it's likely going.\r\nThis is one of the things that crime, and the reaction to\r\ncrime, does to us.\r\n\r\nThe tenor of the meeting now changed as the Electronic Frontier Foundation\r\narrived.  The EFF, whose personnel and history will be examined in detail\r\nin the next chapter, are a pioneering civil liberties group who arose in\r\ndirect response to the Hacker Crackdown of 1990.\r\n\r\nNow Mitchell Kapor, the Foundation's president, and Michael Godwin,\r\nits chief attorney, were confronting federal law enforcement MANO A MANO\r\nfor the first time ever.  Ever alert to the manifold uses of publicity,\r\nMitch Kapor and Mike Godwin had brought their own journalist in tow:\r\nRobert Draper, from Austin, whose recent well-received book about\r\nROLLING STONE magazine was still on the stands.  Draper was on assignment\r\nfor TEXAS MONTHLY.\r\n\r\nThe Steve Jackson/EFF civil lawsuit against the Chicago Computer Fraud\r\nand Abuse Task Force was a matter of considerable regional interest in Texas.\r\nThere were now two Austinite journalists here on the case.  In fact,\r\ncounting Godwin (a former Austinite and former journalist) there were\r\nthree of us.  Lunch was like Old Home Week.\r\n\r\nLater, I took Draper up to my hotel room.  We had a long frank talk\r\nabout the case, networking earnestly like a miniature freelance-journo\r\nversion of the FCIC:  privately confessing the numerous blunders\r\nof journalists covering the story, and trying hard to figure out\r\nwho was who and what the hell was really going on out there.\r\nI showed Draper everything I had dug out of the Hilton trashcan.\r\nWe pondered the ethics of \"trashing\" for a while, and agreed\r\nthat they were dismal.  We also agreed that finding a SPRINT\r\nbill on your first time out was a heck of a coincidence.\r\n\r\nFirst I'd \"trashed\"--and now, mere hours later, I'd bragged to someone else.\r\nHaving entered the lifestyle of hackerdom, I was now, unsurprisingly,\r\nfollowing  its logic.  Having discovered something remarkable through\r\na surreptitious action, I of course HAD to \"brag,\" and to drag the passing\r\nDraper into my iniquities.  I felt I needed a witness.  Otherwise nobody\r\nwould have believed what I'd discovered. . . .\r\n\r\nBack at the meeting, Thackeray cordially, if rather tentatively,\r\nintroduced Kapor and Godwin to her colleagues.  Papers were distributed.\r\nKapor took center stage.  The brilliant Bostonian high-tech entrepreneur,\r\nnormally the hawk in his own administration and quite an effective\r\npublic speaker, seemed visibly nervous, and frankly admitted as much.\r\nHe began by saying he consided computer-intrusion to be morally wrong,\r\nand that the EFF was not a \"hacker defense fund,\" despite what had appeared\r\nin print.  Kapor chatted a bit about the basic motivations of his group,\r\nemphasizing their good faith and willingness to listen and seek common ground\r\nwith law enforcement--when, er, possible.\r\n\r\nThen, at Godwin's urging, Kapor suddenly remarked that EFF's own Internet\r\nmachine had been \"hacked\" recently, and that EFF did not consider\r\nthis incident amusing.\r\n\r\nAfter this surprising confession, things began to loosen up\r\nquite rapidly.  Soon Kapor was fielding questions, parrying objections,\r\nchallenging definitions, and juggling paradigms with something akin\r\nto his usual gusto.\r\n\r\nKapor seemed to score quite an effect with his shrewd and skeptical analysis\r\nof the merits of telco \"Caller-ID\" services.  (On this topic, FCIC and EFF\r\nhave never been at loggerheads, and have no particular established earthworks\r\nto defend.)  Caller-ID has generally been promoted as a privacy service\r\nfor consumers, a presentation Kapor described as a \"smokescreen,\"\r\nthe real point of Caller-ID being to ALLOW CORPORATE CUSTOMERS TO BUILD\r\nEXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL DATABASES ON EVERYBODY WHO PHONES OR FAXES THEM.\r\nClearly, few people in the room had considered this possibility,\r\nexcept perhaps for two late-arrivals from US WEST RBOC security,\r\nwho chuckled nervously.\r\n\r\nMike Godwin then made an extensive presentation on\r\n\"Civil Liberties Implications of Computer Searches and Seizures.\"\r\nNow, at last, we were getting to the real nitty-gritty here,\r\nreal political horse-trading.  The audience listened with close\r\nattention, angry mutters rising occasionally:  \"He's trying to\r\nteach us our jobs!\"  \"We've been thinking about this for years!\r\nWe think about these issues every day!\"  \"If I didn't seize the works,\r\nI'd be sued by the guy's victims!\"  \"I'm violating the law if I leave\r\nten thousand disks full of illegal PIRATED SOFTWARE and STOLEN CODES!\"\r\n\"It's our job to make sure people don't trash the Constitution--\r\nwe're the DEFENDERS of the Constitution!\"  \"We seize stuff when\r\nwe know it will be forfeited anyway as restitution for the victim!\"\r\n\r\n\"If it's forfeitable, then don't get a search warrant, get a\r\nforfeiture warrant,\" Godwin suggested coolly.  He further remarked\r\nthat most suspects in computer crime don't WANT to see their computers\r\nvanish out the door, headed God knew where, for who knows how long.\r\nThey might not mind a search, even an extensive search, but they want\r\ntheir machines searched on-site.\r\n\r\n\"Are they gonna feed us?\"  somebody asked sourly.\r\n\r\n\"How about if you take copies of the data?\" Godwin parried.\r\n\r\n\"That'll never stand up in court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, you make copies, give THEM the copies, and take the originals.\"\r\n\r\nHmmm.\r\n\r\nGodwin championed bulletin-board systems as repositories of First Amendment\r\nprotected free speech.  He complained that federal computer-crime training\r\nmanuals gave boards a bad press, suggesting that they are hotbeds of crime\r\nhaunted by pedophiles and crooks, whereas the vast majority of the nation's\r\nthousands of boards are completely innocuous, and nowhere near so\r\nromantically suspicious.\r\n\r\nPeople who run boards violently resent it when their systems are seized,\r\nand their dozens (or hundreds) of users look on in abject horror.\r\nTheir rights of free expression are cut short.  Their right to associate\r\nwith other people is infringed.  And their privacy is violated as their\r\nprivate electronic mail becomes police property.\r\n\r\nNot a soul spoke up to defend the practice of seizing boards.\r\nThe issue passed in chastened silence.  Legal principles aside--\r\n(and those principles cannot be settled without laws passed or\r\ncourt precedents)--seizing bulletin boards has become public-relations\r\npoison for American computer police.\r\n\r\nAnd anyway, it's not entirely necessary.  If you're a cop, you can get 'most\r\neverything you need from a pirate board, just by using an inside informant.\r\nPlenty of vigilantes--well, CONCERNED CITIZENS--will inform police the moment\r\nthey see a pirate board hit their area  (and will tell the police all about it,\r\nin such technical detail, actually, that you kinda wish they'd shut up).\r\nThey will happily supply police with extensive downloads or printouts.\r\nIt's IMPOSSIBLE to keep this fluid electronic information out of the\r\nhands of police.\r\n\r\nSome people in the electronic community become enraged at the prospect\r\nof cops \"monitoring\" bulletin boards.  This does have touchy aspects,\r\nas Secret Service people in particular examine bulletin boards with\r\nsome regularity.  But to expect electronic police to be deaf dumb\r\nand blind in regard to this particular medium rather flies in the face\r\nof common sense. Police watch television, listen to radio, read newspapers\r\nand magazines; why should the new medium of boards be different?\r\nCops can exercise the same access to electronic information\r\nas everybody else.  As we have seen, quite a few computer\r\npolice maintain THEIR OWN bulletin boards, including anti-hacker\r\n\"sting\" boards, which have generally proven quite effective.\r\n\r\nAs a final clincher, their Mountie friends in Canada (and colleagues\r\nin Ireland and Taiwan) don't have First Amendment or American\r\nconstitutional restrictions, but they do have phone lines,\r\nand can call any bulletin board in America whenever they please.\r\nThe same technological determinants that play into the hands of hackers,\r\nphone phreaks and software pirates can play into the hands of police.\r\n\"Technological determinants\" don't have ANY human allegiances.\r\nThey're not black or white, or Establishment or Underground,\r\nor pro-or-anti anything.\r\n\r\nGodwin  complained at length about what he called \"the Clever Hobbyist\r\nhypothesis\" --the assumption that the \"hacker\" you're busting is clearly\r\na technical genius, and must therefore by searched with extreme thoroughness.\r\nSo:  from the law's point of view, why risk missing anything?  Take the works.\r\nTake the guy's computer.  Take his books. Take his notebooks.\r\nTake the electronic drafts of his love letters. Take his Walkman.\r\nTake his wife's computer.  Take his dad's computer.  Take his kid\r\nsister's computer.  Take his employer's computer.  Take his compact disks--\r\nthey MIGHT be CD-ROM disks, cunningly disguised as pop music.\r\nTake his laser printer--he might have hidden something vital in the\r\nprinter's 5meg of memory.  Take his software manuals and hardware\r\ndocumentation. Take his science-fiction novels and his simulation-\r\ngaming books.  Take his Nintendo Game-Boy and his Pac-Man arcade game.\r\nTake his answering machine, take his telephone out of the wall.\r\nTake anything remotely suspicious.\r\n\r\nGodwin pointed out that most \"hackers\" are not, in fact, clever\r\ngenius hobbyists.  Quite a few are crooks and grifters who don't\r\nhave much in the way of technical sophistication; just some rule-of-thumb\r\nrip-off techniques.  The same goes for most fifteen-year-olds who've\r\ndownloaded a code-scanning program from a pirate board.  There's no\r\nreal need to seize everything in sight.  It doesn't require an entire\r\ncomputer system and ten thousand disks to prove a case in court.\r\n\r\nWhat if the computer is the instrumentality of a crime? someone demanded.\r\n\r\nGodwin admitted quietly that the doctrine of seizing the instrumentality\r\nof a crime was pretty well established in the American legal system.\r\n\r\nThe meeting broke up.  Godwin and Kapor had to leave.  Kapor was testifying\r\nnext morning before the Massachusetts Department Of Public Utility,\r\nabout ISDN narrowband wide-area networking.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were gone, Thackeray seemed elated.\r\nShe had taken a great risk with this.  Her colleagues had not,\r\nin fact, torn Kapor and Godwin's heads off.  She was very proud of them,\r\nand told them so.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear what Godwin said about INSTRUMENTALITY OF A CRIME?\"\r\nshe exulted, to nobody in particular.  \"Wow, that means\r\nMITCH ISN'T GOING TO SUE ME.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nAmerica's computer police are an interesting group.\r\nAs a social phenomenon they are far more interesting,\r\nand far more important, than teenage phone phreaks\r\nand computer hackers.  First, they're older and wiser;\r\nnot dizzy hobbyists with leaky morals, but seasoned adult\r\nprofessionals with all the responsibilities of public service.\r\nAnd, unlike hackers, they possess not merely TECHNICAL\r\npower alone, but heavy-duty legal and social authority.\r\n\r\nAnd, very interestingly, they are just as much at\r\nsea in cyberspace as everyone else.  They are not\r\nhappy about this.  Police are authoritarian by nature,\r\nand prefer to obey rules and precedents.  (Even those police\r\nwho secretly enjoy a fast ride in rough territory will soberly\r\ndisclaim any \"cowboy\" attitude.) But in cyberspace there ARE\r\nno rules and precedents.  They are groundbreaking pioneers,\r\nCyberspace Rangers, whether they like it or not.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, any teenager enthralled by computers,\r\nfascinated by the ins and outs of computer security,\r\nand attracted by the lure of specialized forms of knowledge and power,\r\nwould do well to forget all about \"hacking\" and set his (or her)\r\nsights on becoming a fed.  Feds can trump hackers at almost every\r\nsingle thing hackers do, including gathering intelligence,\r\nundercover disguise, trashing, phone-tapping, building dossiers,\r\nnetworking, and infiltrating computer systems--CRIMINAL computer systems.\r\nSecret Service agents know more about phreaking, coding and carding\r\nthan most phreaks can find out in years, and when it comes to viruses,\r\nbreak-ins, software bombs and trojan horses, Feds have direct access to red-hot\r\nconfidential information that is only vague rumor in the underground.\r\n\r\nAnd if it's an impressive public rep you're after, there are few people\r\nin the world who can be so chillingly impressive as a well-trained,\r\nwell-armed United States Secret Service agent.\r\n\r\nOf course, a few personal sacrifices are necessary in order to obtain\r\nthat power and knowledge.  First, you'll have the galling discipline\r\nof belonging to a large organization;  but the world of computer crime\r\nis still so small, and so amazingly fast-moving, that it will remain\r\nspectacularly fluid for years to come.  The second sacrifice is that\r\nyou'll have to give up ripping people off.  This is not a great loss.\r\nAbstaining from the use of illegal drugs, also necessary, will be a boon\r\nto your health.\r\n\r\nA career in computer security is not a bad choice for a young man\r\nor woman today.  The field will almost certainly expand drastically\r\nin years to come.  If you are a teenager today, by the time you\r\nbecome a professional, the pioneers you have read about in this book\r\nwill be the grand old men and women of the field, swamped by their many\r\ndisciples and successors.  Of course, some of them, like William P. Wood\r\nof the 1865 Secret Service, may well be mangled in the whirring machinery\r\nof legal controversy; but by the time you enter the computer-crime field,\r\nit may have stabilized somewhat, while remaining entertainingly challenging.\r\n\r\nBut you can't just have a badge.  You have to win it.  First, there's the\r\nfederal law enforcement training.  And it's hard--it's a challenge.\r\nA real challenge--not for wimps and rodents.\r\n\r\nEvery Secret Service agent must complete gruelling courses at the\r\nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center.  (In fact, Secret Service\r\nagents are periodically re-trained during their entire careers.)\r\n\r\nIn order to get a glimpse of what this might be like,\r\nI myself travelled to FLETC.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is a 1500-acre facility\r\non Georgia's Atlantic coast.  It's a milieu of marshgrass, seabirds,\r\ndamp, clinging sea-breezes, palmettos, mosquitos, and bats.\r\nUntil 1974, it was a Navy Air Base, and still features a working runway,\r\nand some WWII vintage blockhouses and officers' quarters.\r\nThe Center has since benefitted by a forty-million-dollar retrofit,\r\nbut there's still enough forest and swamp on the facility for the\r\nBorder Patrol to put in tracking practice.\r\n\r\nAs a town, \"Glynco\" scarcely exists.  The nearest real town is Brunswick,\r\na few miles down Highway 17, where I stayed at the aptly named Marshview\r\nHoliday Inn.  I had Sunday dinner at a seafood restaurant called \"Jinright's,\"\r\nwhere I feasted on deep-fried alligator tail.  This local favorite was\r\na heaped basket of bite-sized chunks of white, tender, almost fluffy\r\nreptile meat, steaming in a peppered batter crust.  Alligator makes\r\na culinary experience that's hard to forget, especially when liberally\r\nbasted with homemade cocktail sauce from a Jinright squeeze-bottle.\r\n\r\nThe crowded clientele were tourists, fishermen, local black folks\r\nin their Sunday best, and white Georgian locals who all seemed\r\nto bear an uncanny resemblance to Georgia humorist Lewis Grizzard.\r\n\r\nThe 2,400 students from 75 federal agencies who make up the FLETC\r\npopulation scarcely seem to make a dent in the low-key local scene.\r\nThe students look like tourists, and the teachers seem to have taken\r\non much of the relaxed air of the Deep South.  My host was Mr. Carlton\r\nFitzpatrick, the Program Coordinator of the Financial Fraud Institute.\r\nCarlton Fitzpatrick is a mustached, sinewy, well-tanned Alabama native\r\nsomewhere near his late forties, with a fondness for chewing tobacco,\r\npowerful computers, and salty, down-home homilies.  We'd met before,\r\nat FCIC in Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe Financial Fraud Institute is one of the nine divisions at FLETC.\r\nBesides Financial Fraud, there's Driver & Marine, Firearms,\r\nand Physical Training.  These are specialized pursuits.\r\nThere are also five general training divisions:  Basic Training,\r\nOperations, Enforcement Techniques, Legal Division, and Behavioral Science.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in this curriculum is everything necessary to turn green college\r\ngraduates into federal agents.  First they're given ID cards.  Then they get\r\nthe rather miserable-looking blue coveralls known as \"smurf suits.\"\r\nThe trainees are assigned a barracks and a cafeteria, and immediately\r\nset on FLETC's bone-grinding physical training routine.  Besides the\r\nobligatory  daily jogging--(the trainers run up danger flags beside\r\nthe track when the humidity rises high enough to threaten heat stroke)--\r\nhere's the Nautilus machines, the martial arts, the survival skills. . . .\r\n\r\nThe eighteen federal agencies who maintain on-site academies at FLETC\r\nemploy a wide variety of specialized law enforcement units, some of them\r\nrather arcane.  There's Border Patrol, IRS Criminal Investigation Division,\r\nPark Service, Fish and Wildlife, Customs, Immigration, Secret Service and\r\nthe Treasury's uniformed subdivisions. . . .  If you're a federal cop\r\nand you don't work for the FBI, you train at FLETC.  This includes people\r\nas apparently obscure as the agents of the Railroad Retirement Board\r\nInspector General.  Or the Tennessee Valley Authority Police,\r\nwho are in fact federal police officers, and can and do arrest criminals\r\non the federal property of the Tennessee Valley Authority.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are the computer-crime people.  All sorts, all backgrounds.\r\nMr. Fitzpatrick is not jealous of his specialized knowledge.  Cops all over,\r\nin every branch of service, may feel a need to learn what he can teach.\r\nBackgrounds don't matter much.  Fitzpatrick himself was originally a\r\nBorder Patrol veteran, then became a Border Patrol instructor at FLETC.\r\nHis Spanish is still fluent--but he found himself strangely fascinated\r\nwhen the first computers showed up at the Training Center.  Fitzpatrick\r\ndid have a background in electrical engineering, and though he never\r\nconsidered himself a computer hacker, he somehow found himself writing\r\nuseful little programs for this new and promising gizmo.\r\n\r\nHe began looking into the general subject of computers and crime,\r\nreading Donn Parker's books and articles, keeping an ear cocked\r\nfor war stories, useful insights from the field, the up-and-coming\r\npeople of the local computer-crime and high-technology units. . . .\r\nSoon he got a reputation around FLETC as the resident \"computer expert,\"\r\nand that reputation alone brought him more exposure, more experience--\r\nuntil one day he looked around, and sure enough he WAS a federal\r\ncomputer-crime expert.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this unassuming, genial man may be THE federal computer-crime expert.\r\nThere are plenty of very good computer people, and plenty of very good\r\nfederal investigators, but the area where these worlds of expertise overlap\r\nis very slim.  And Carlton Fitzpatrick has been right at the center of that\r\nsince 1985, the first year of the Colluquy, a group which owes much to\r\nhis influence.\r\n\r\nHe seems quite at home in his modest, acoustic-tiled office,\r\nwith its Ansel Adams-style Western photographic art, a gold-framed\r\nSenior Instructor Certificate, and a towering bookcase crammed with\r\nthree-ring binders with ominous titles such as Datapro Reports on\r\nInformation Security and CFCA Telecom Security '90.\r\n\r\nThe phone rings every ten minutes; colleagues show up at the door\r\nto chat about new developments in locksmithing or to shake their heads\r\nover the latest dismal developments in the BCCI global banking scandal.\r\n\r\nCarlton Fitzpatrick is a fount of computer-crime war-stories,\r\nrelated in an acerbic drawl.  He tells me the colorful tale\r\nof a hacker caught in California some years back.  He'd been\r\nraiding systems, typing code without a detectable break,\r\nfor twenty, twenty-four, thirty-six hours straight.  Not just\r\nlogged on--TYPING.  Investigators were baffled.  Nobody\r\ncould do that.  Didn't he have to go to the bathroom?\r\nWas it some kind of automatic keyboard-whacking device\r\nthat could actually type code?\r\n\r\nA raid on the suspect's home revealed a situation of astonishing squalor.\r\nThe hacker turned out to be a Pakistani computer-science student who had\r\nflunked out of a California university.  He'd gone completely underground\r\nas an illegal electronic immigrant, and was selling stolen phone-service\r\nto stay alive.  The place was not merely messy and dirty, but in a state\r\nof psychotic disorder.  Powered by some weird mix of culture shock,\r\ncomputer addiction, and amphetamines, the suspect had in fact been sitting\r\nin front of his computer for a day and a half straight, with snacks and\r\ndrugs at hand on the edge of his desk and a chamber-pot under his chair.\r\n\r\nWord about stuff like this gets around in the hacker-tracker community.\r\n\r\nCarlton Fitzpatrick takes me for a guided tour by car around the\r\nFLETC grounds.  One of our first sights is the biggest indoor\r\nfiring range in the world.  There are federal trainees in there,\r\nFitzpatrick assures me politely, blasting away with a wide variety\r\nof automatic weapons: Uzis, Glocks, AK-47s. . . .  He's willing to\r\ntake me inside.  I tell him I'm sure that's really interesting,\r\nbut I'd rather see his computers.  Carlton Fitzpatrick seems quite\r\nsurprised and pleased.  I'm apparently the first journalist he's ever\r\nseen who has turned down the shooting gallery in favor of microchips.\r\n\r\nOur next stop is a favorite with touring Congressmen:  the three-mile\r\nlong FLETC driving range.  Here trainees of the Driver & Marine Division\r\nare taught high-speed pursuit skills, setting and breaking road-blocks,\r\ndiplomatic security driving for VIP limousines. . . .  A favorite FLETC\r\npastime is to strap a passing Senator into the passenger seat beside a\r\nDriver & Marine trainer, hit a hundred miles an hour, then take it right into\r\n\"the skid-pan,\" a section of greased track  where two tons of Detroit iron\r\ncan whip and spin like a hockey puck.\r\n\r\nCars don't fare well at FLETC.  First they're rifled again and again\r\nfor search practice.  Then they do 25,000 miles of high-speed\r\npursuit training; they get about seventy miles per set\r\nof steel-belted radials.  Then it's off to the skid pan,\r\nwhere sometimes they roll and tumble headlong in the grease.\r\nWhen they're sufficiently grease-stained, dented, and creaky,\r\nthey're sent to the roadblock unit, where they're battered without pity.\r\nAnd finally then they're sacrificed to the Bureau of Alcohol,\r\nTobacco and Firearms, whose trainees learn the ins and outs\r\nof car-bomb work by blowing them into smoking wreckage.\r\n\r\nThere's a railroad box-car on the FLETC grounds, and a large\r\ngrounded boat, and a propless plane; all training-grounds for searches.\r\nThe plane sits forlornly on a patch of weedy tarmac next to an eerie\r\nblockhouse known as the \"ninja compound,\" where anti-terrorism specialists\r\npractice hostage rescues.  As I gaze on this creepy paragon of modern\r\nlow-intensity warfare, my nerves are jangled by a sudden staccato outburst\r\nof automatic weapons fire, somewhere in the woods to my right.\r\n\"Nine-millimeter,\" Fitzpatrick judges calmly.\r\n\r\nEven the eldritch ninja compound pales somewhat compared\r\nto the truly surreal area known as \"the raid-houses.\"\r\nThis is a street lined on both sides with nondescript\r\nconcrete-block houses with flat pebbled roofs.\r\nThey were once officers' quarters. Now they are training grounds.\r\nThe first one to our left, Fitzpatrick tells me, has been specially\r\nadapted for computer search-and-seizure practice.  Inside it has been\r\nwired for video from top to bottom, with eighteen pan-and-tilt\r\nremotely controlled videocams mounted on walls and in corners.\r\nEvery movement of the trainee agent is recorded live by teachers,\r\nfor later taped analysis.  Wasted movements, hesitations, possibly lethal\r\ntactical mistakes--all are gone over in detail.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the weirdest single aspect of this building is its front door,\r\nscarred and scuffed all along the bottom, from the repeated impact,\r\nday after day, of federal shoe-leather.\r\n\r\nDown at the far end of the row of raid-houses some people are practicing\r\na murder.  We drive by slowly as some very young and rather nervous-looking\r\nfederal trainees interview a heavyset bald man on the raid-house lawn.\r\nDealing with murder takes a lot of practice; first you have to learn\r\nto control your own instinctive disgust and panic, then you have to learn\r\nto control the reactions of a nerve-shredded crowd of civilians,\r\nsome of whom may have just lost a loved one, some of whom may be murderers--\r\nquite possibly both at once.\r\n\r\nA dummy plays the corpse.  The roles of the bereaved, the morbidly curious,\r\nand the homicidal are played, for pay, by local Georgians:  waitresses,\r\nmusicians, most anybody who needs to moonlight and can learn a script.\r\nThese people, some of whom are FLETC regulars year after year,\r\nmust surely have one of the strangest jobs in the world.\r\n\r\nSomething about the scene:  \"normal\" people in a weird situation,\r\nstanding around talking in bright Georgia sunshine, unsuccessfully\r\npretending that something dreadful has gone on, while a dummy lies\r\ninside on faked bloodstains. . . .  While behind this weird masquerade,\r\nlike a nested set of Russian dolls, are grim future realities of real death,\r\nreal violence, real murders of real people, that these young agents\r\nwill really investigate, many times during their careers. . . .\r\nOver and over. . . .  Will those anticipated murders look like this,\r\nfeel like this--not as \"real\" as these amateur actors are trying to\r\nmake it seem, but both as \"real,\" and as numbingly unreal, as watching\r\nfake people standing around on a fake lawn?  Something about this scene\r\nunhinges me.  It seems nightmarish to me, Kafkaesque.  I simply don't\r\nknow how to take it; my head is turned around; I don't know whether to laugh,\r\ncry, or just shudder.\r\n\r\nWhen the tour is over, Carlton Fitzpatrick and I talk about computers.\r\nFor the first time cyberspace seems like quite a comfortable place.\r\nIt seems very real to me suddenly, a place where I know what I'm talking about,\r\na place I'm used to.  It's real.  \"Real.\"  Whatever.\r\n\r\nCarlton Fitzpatrick is the only person I've met in cyberspace circles\r\nwho is happy with his present equipment.  He's got a 5 Meg RAM PC with\r\na 112 meg hard disk; a 660 meg's on the way.  He's got a Compaq 386 desktop,\r\nand a Zenith 386 laptop with 120 meg.  Down the hall is a NEC Multi-Sync 2A\r\nwith a CD-ROM drive and a 9600 baud modem with four com-lines.\r\nThere's a training minicomputer, and a 10-meg local mini just for the Center,\r\nand a lab-full of student PC clones and half-a-dozen Macs or so.\r\nThere's a Data General MV 2500 with 8 meg on board and a 370 meg disk.\r\n\r\nFitzpatrick plans to run a UNIX board on the Data General when he's\r\nfinished beta-testing the software for it, which he wrote himself.\r\nIt'll have E-mail features, massive files on all manner of computer-crime\r\nand investigation procedures, and will follow the computer-security\r\nspecifics of the Department of Defense \"Orange Book.\"  He thinks\r\nit will be the biggest BBS in the federal government.\r\n\r\nWill it have Phrack on it?  I ask wryly.\r\n\r\nSure, he tells me.  Phrack, TAP, Computer Underground Digest,\r\nall that stuff.  With proper disclaimers, of course.\r\n\r\nI ask him if he plans to be the sysop.  Running a system that size is very\r\ntime-consuming, and Fitzpatrick teaches two three-hour courses every day.\r\n\r\nNo, he says seriously, FLETC has to get its money worth out of the instructors.\r\nHe thinks he can get a local volunteer to do it, a high-school student.\r\n\r\nHe says a bit more, something I think about an Eagle Scout law-enforcement\r\nliaison program, but my mind has rocketed off in disbelief.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to put a TEENAGER in charge of a federal security BBS?\"\r\nI'm speechless.  It hasn't escaped my notice that the FLETC Financial\r\nFraud Institute is the ULTIMATE hacker-trashing target; there is stuff in here,\r\nstuff of such utter and consummate cool by every standard of the\r\ndigital underground. . . .\r\n\r\nI imagine the hackers of my acquaintance, fainting dead-away from\r\nforbidden-knowledge greed-fits, at the mere prospect of cracking\r\nthe superultra top-secret computers used to train the Secret Service\r\nin computer-crime. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Uhm, Carlton,\" I babble, \"I'm sure he's a really nice kid and all,\r\nbut that's a terrible temptation to set in front of somebody who's,\r\nyou know, into computers and just starting out. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he says, \"that did occur to me.\"  For the first time I begin\r\nto suspect that he's pulling my leg.\r\n\r\nHe seems proudest when he shows me an ongoing project called JICC,\r\nJoint Intelligence Control Council.  It's based on the services provided\r\nby EPIC, the El Paso Intelligence Center, which supplies data and intelligence\r\nto the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs Service, the Coast Guard,\r\nand the state police of the four southern border states.  Certain EPIC files\r\ncan now be accessed by drug-enforcement police of Central America,\r\nSouth America and the Caribbean, who can also trade information\r\namong themselves. Using a telecom program called \"White Hat,\"\r\nwritten by two brothers named Lopez from the Dominican Republic,\r\npolice can now network internationally on inexpensive PCs.\r\nCarlton Fitzpatrick is teaching a class of drug-war agents\r\nfrom the Third World, and he's very proud of their progress.\r\nPerhaps soon the sophisticated smuggling networks of the\r\nMedellin Cartel will be matched by a sophisticated computer\r\nnetwork of the Medellin Cartel's sworn enemies.  They'll track boats,\r\ntrack contraband, track the international drug-lords who now leap over\r\nborders with great ease, defeating the police through the clever use\r\nof fragmented national jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nJICC and EPIC must remain beyond the scope of this book.\r\nThey seem to me to be very large topics fraught with complications\r\nthat I am not fit to judge.  I do know, however, that the international,\r\ncomputer-assisted networking of police, across national boundaries,\r\nis something that Carlton Fitzpatrick considers very important,\r\na harbinger of a desirable future.  I also know that networks\r\nby their nature ignore physical boundaries.  And I also know\r\nthat where you put communications you put a community,\r\nand that when those communities become self-aware\r\nthey will fight to preserve themselves and to expand their influence.\r\nI make no judgements whether this is good or bad.\r\nIt's just cyberspace; it's just the way things are.\r\n\r\nI asked Carlton Fitzpatrick what advice he would have for\r\na twenty-year-old who wanted to shine someday in the world\r\nof electronic law enforcement.\r\n\r\nHe told me that the number one rule was simply not to be\r\nscared of computers.  You don't need to be an obsessive\r\n\"computer weenie,\" but you mustn't be buffaloed just because\r\nsome machine looks fancy.  The advantages computers give\r\nsmart crooks are matched by the advantages they give smart cops.\r\nCops in the future will have to enforce the law \"with their heads,\r\nnot their holsters.\"  Today you can make good cases without ever\r\nleaving your office.  In the future, cops who resist the computer\r\nrevolution will never get far beyond walking a beat.\r\n\r\nI asked Carlton Fitzpatrick if he had some single message for the public;\r\nsome single thing that he would most like the American public to know\r\nabout his work.\r\n\r\nHe thought about it while.  \"Yes,\" he said finally.  \"TELL me the rules,\r\nand I'll TEACH those rules!\"  He looked me straight in the eye.\r\n\"I do the best that I can.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR:  THE CIVIL LIBERTARIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the Hacker Crackdown, as we have followed it thus far,\r\nhas been technological, subcultural, criminal and legal.\r\nThe story of the Civil Libertarians, though it partakes\r\nof all those other aspects, is profoundly and thoroughly POLITICAL.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the obscure, long-simmering struggle over the ownership\r\nand nature of cyberspace became loudly and irretrievably public.\r\nPeople from some of the oddest corners of American society suddenly\r\nfound themselves public figures.  Some of these people found this\r\nsituation much more than they had ever bargained for.  They backpedalled,\r\nand tried to retreat back to the mandarin obscurity of their cozy\r\nsubcultural niches.  This was generally to prove a mistake.\r\n\r\nBut the civil libertarians seized the day in 1990.  They found themselves\r\norganizing, propagandizing, podium-pounding, persuading, touring,\r\nnegotiating, posing for publicity photos, submitting to interviews,\r\nsquinting in the limelight as they tried a tentative, but growingly\r\nsophisticated, buck-and-wing upon the public stage.\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to see why the civil libertarians should have\r\nthis competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nThe  hackers  of the digital underground are an hermetic elite.\r\nThey find it hard to make any remotely convincing case for\r\ntheir actions in front of the general public.  Actually,\r\nhackers roundly despise the \"ignorant\" public, and have never\r\ntrusted the judgement of \"the system.\"  Hackers do propagandize,\r\nbut only among themselves, mostly in giddy, badly spelled manifestos\r\nof class warfare, youth rebellion or naive techie utopianism.\r\nHackers must strut and boast in order to establish and preserve\r\ntheir underground reputations.  But if they speak out too loudly\r\nand publicly, they will break the fragile surface-tension of the underground,\r\nand they will be harrassed or arrested.  Over the longer term,\r\nmost hackers stumble, get busted, get betrayed, or simply give up.\r\nAs a political force, the digital underground is hamstrung.\r\n\r\nThe telcos, for their part, are an ivory tower under protracted seige.\r\nThey have plenty of money with which to push their calculated public image,\r\nbut they waste much energy and goodwill attacking one another with\r\nslanderous and demeaning ad campaigns.  The telcos have suffered\r\nat the hands of politicians, and, like hackers, they don't trust\r\nthe public's judgement.  And this distrust may be well-founded.\r\nShould the general public of the high-tech 1990s come to understand\r\nits own best interests in telecommunications, that might well pose\r\na grave threat to the specialized technical power and authority\r\nthat the telcos have relished for over a century.  The telcos do\r\nhave strong advantages: loyal employees, specialized expertise,\r\ninfluence in the halls of power, tactical allies in law enforcement,\r\nand unbelievably vast amounts of money.  But politically speaking, they lack\r\ngenuine grassroots support; they simply don't seem to have many friends.\r\n\r\nCops know a lot of things other people don't know.\r\nBut cops willingly reveal only those aspects of their\r\nknowledge that they feel will meet their institutional\r\npurposes and further public order.  Cops have respect,\r\nthey have responsibilities, they have power in the streets\r\nand even power in the home, but cops don't do particularly\r\nwell in limelight.  When pressed, they will step out in the\r\npublic gaze to threaten bad-guys, or to cajole prominent citizens,\r\nor perhaps to sternly lecture the naive and misguided.\r\nBut then they go back within their time-honored fortress\r\nof the station-house, the courtroom and the rule-book.\r\n\r\nThe electronic civil libertarians, however, have proven to be\r\nborn political animals.  They seemed to grasp very early on\r\nthe postmodern truism that communication is power.  Publicity is power.\r\nSoundbites are power.  The ability to shove one's issue onto the public\r\nagenda--and KEEP IT THERE--is power.  Fame is power.  Simple personal\r\nfluency and eloquence can be power, if you can somehow catch the\r\npublic's eye and ear.\r\n\r\nThe civil libertarians had no monopoly on \"technical power\"--\r\nthough they all owned computers, most were not particularly\r\nadvanced computer experts.  They had a good deal of money,\r\nbut nowhere near the earthshaking wealth and the galaxy\r\nof resources possessed by telcos or federal agencies.\r\nThey had no ability to arrest people.  They carried\r\nout no phreak and hacker covert dirty-tricks.\r\n\r\nBut they really knew how to network.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other groups in this book, the civil libertarians\r\nhave operated very much in the open, more or less right\r\nin the public hurly-burly.  They have lectured audiences galore\r\nand talked to countless journalists, and have learned to\r\nrefine their spiels.  They've kept the cameras clicking,\r\nkept those faxes humming, swapped that email,\r\nrun those photocopiers on overtime, licked envelopes\r\nand spent small fortunes on airfare and long-distance.\r\nIn an information society, this open, overt, obvious activity\r\nhas proven to be a profound advantage.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the civil libertarians of cyberspace assembled\r\nout of nowhere in particular, at warp speed.  This \"group\"\r\n(actually, a networking gaggle of interested parties\r\nwhich scarcely deserves even that loose term) has almost nothing\r\nin the way of formal organization.  Those formal civil libertarian\r\norganizations which did take an interest in cyberspace issues,\r\nmainly the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility\r\nand the American Civil Liberties Union, were carried along\r\nby events in 1990, and acted mostly as adjuncts,\r\nunderwriters or launching-pads.\r\n\r\nThe civil libertarians nevertheless enjoyed the greatest success\r\nof any of the groups in the Crackdown of 1990.  At this writing,\r\ntheir future looks rosy and the political initiative is firmly in their hands.\r\nThis should be kept in mind as we study the highly unlikely lives\r\nand lifestyles of the people who actually made this happen.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIn June 1989, Apple Computer, Inc., of Cupertino,\r\nCalifornia, had a problem.  Someone had illicitly copied\r\na small piece of Apple's proprietary software, software\r\nwhich controlled an internal chip driving the Macintosh\r\nscreen display.  This Color QuickDraw source code was\r\na closely guarded piece of Apple's intellectual property.\r\nOnly trusted Apple insiders were supposed to possess it.\r\n\r\nBut the \"NuPrometheus League\" wanted things otherwise.\r\nThis person (or persons) made several illicit copies\r\nof this source code, perhaps as many as two dozen.\r\nHe (or she, or they) then put those illicit floppy disks\r\ninto envelopes and mailed them to people all over America:\r\npeople in the computer industry who were associated with,\r\nbut not directly employed by, Apple Computer.\r\n\r\nThe NuPrometheus caper was a complex, highly ideological,\r\nand very hacker-like crime.  Prometheus, it will be recalled,\r\nstole the fire of the Gods and gave this potent gift to the\r\ngeneral ranks of downtrodden mankind.  A similar god-in-the-manger\r\nattitude was implied for the corporate elite of Apple Computer,\r\nwhile the \"Nu\" Prometheus had himself cast in the role of rebel demigod.\r\nThe illicitly copied data was given away for free.\r\n\r\nThe new Prometheus, whoever he was, escaped the\r\nfate of the ancient Greek Prometheus, who was chained\r\nto a rock for centuries by the vengeful gods while an eagle\r\ntore and ate his liver.  On the other hand, NuPrometheus\r\nchickened out somewhat by comparison with his role model.\r\nThe small chunk of Color QuickDraw code he had filched\r\nand replicated was more or less useless to Apple's\r\nindustrial rivals (or, in fact, to anyone else).\r\nInstead of giving fire to mankind, it was more as if\r\nNuPrometheus had photocopied the schematics for part of a Bic lighter.\r\nThe act was not a genuine work of industrial espionage.\r\nIt was best interpreted as a symbolic, deliberate slap\r\nin the face for the Apple corporate heirarchy.\r\n\r\nApple's internal struggles were well-known in the industry.  Apple's founders,\r\nJobs and Wozniak, had both taken their leave long since.  Their raucous core\r\nof senior employees had been a barnstorming crew of 1960s Californians,\r\nmany of them markedly less than happy with the new button-down multimillion\r\ndollar regime at Apple.  Many of the programmers and developers who had\r\ninvented the Macintosh model in the early 1980s had also taken their leave of\r\nthe company.  It was they, not the current masters of Apple's corporate fate,\r\nwho had invented the stolen Color QuickDraw code.  The NuPrometheus stunt\r\nwas well-calculated to wound company morale.\r\n\r\nApple called the FBI.  The Bureau takes an interest in high-profile\r\nintellectual-property theft cases, industrial espionage and theft\r\nof trade secrets.  These were likely the right people to call,\r\nand rumor has it that the entities responsible were in fact discovered\r\nby the FBI, and then quietly squelched by Apple management.  NuPrometheus\r\nwas never publicly charged with a crime, or prosecuted, or jailed.\r\nBut there were no further illicit releases of Macintosh internal software.\r\nEventually the painful issue of NuPrometheus was allowed to fade.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, a large number of puzzled bystanders\r\nfound themselves entertaining surprise guests from the FBI.\r\n\r\nOne of these people was John Perry Barlow.  Barlow is a most unusual man,\r\ndifficult to describe in conventional terms.  He is perhaps best known as\r\na songwriter for the Grateful Dead, for he composed lyrics for\r\n\"Hell in a Bucket,\" \"Picasso Moon,\" \"Mexicali Blues,\" \"I Need a Miracle,\"\r\nand many more; he has been writing for the band since 1970.\r\n\r\nBefore we tackle the vexing question as to why a rock lyricist\r\nshould be interviewed by the FBI in a computer-crime case,\r\nit might be well to say a word or two about the Grateful Dead.\r\nThe Grateful Dead are perhaps the most successful and long-lasting\r\nof the numerous cultural emanations from the Haight-Ashbury district\r\nof San Francisco, in the glory days of Movement politics and\r\nlysergic transcendance.  The Grateful Dead are a nexus, a veritable\r\nwhirlwind, of  applique decals, psychedelic vans, tie-dyed T-shirts,\r\nearth-color denim, frenzied dancing and open and unashamed drug use.\r\nThe symbols, and the realities, of Californian freak power surround\r\nthe Grateful Dead like knotted macrame.\r\n\r\nThe Grateful Dead and their thousands of Deadhead devotees\r\nare radical Bohemians.  This much is widely understood.\r\nExactly what this implies in the 1990s is rather more problematic.\r\n\r\nThe Grateful Dead are among the world's most popular\r\nand wealthy entertainers:  number 20, according to Forbes magazine,\r\nright between M.C. Hammer and Sean Connery.  In 1990, this jeans-clad\r\ngroup of purported raffish outcasts earned seventeen million dollars.\r\nThey have been earning sums much along this line for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nAnd while the Dead are not investment bankers or three-piece-suit\r\ntax specialists--they are, in point of fact, hippie musicians--\r\nthis money has not been squandered in senseless Bohemian excess.\r\nThe Dead have been quietly active for many years, funding various\r\nworthy activities in their  extensive and widespread cultural community.\r\n\r\nThe Grateful Dead are not conventional players in the American\r\npower establishment.  They nevertheless are something of a force\r\nto be reckoned with.  They have a lot of money and a lot of friends\r\nin many places, both likely and unlikely.\r\n\r\nThe Dead may be known for back-to-the-earth environmentalist rhetoric,\r\nbut this hardly makes them anti-technological Luddites.  On the contrary,\r\nlike most rock musicians, the Grateful Dead have spent their entire adult\r\nlives in the company of complex electronic equipment.  They have funds to burn\r\non any sophisticated tool and toy that might happen to catch their fancy.\r\nAnd their fancy is quite extensive.\r\n\r\nThe Deadhead community boasts any number of recording engineers,\r\nlighting experts, rock video mavens, electronic technicians\r\nof all descriptions.  And the drift goes both ways.  Steve Wozniak,\r\nApple's co-founder, used to throw rock festivals.  Silicon Valley rocks out.\r\n\r\nThese are the 1990s, not the 1960s.  Today, for a surprising number of people\r\nall over America, the supposed dividing line between Bohemian and technician\r\nsimply no longer exists.  People of this sort may have a set of windchimes\r\nand a dog with a knotted kerchief 'round its neck, but they're also quite\r\nlikely to own a multimegabyte Macintosh running MIDI synthesizer software\r\nand trippy fractal simulations.  These days, even Timothy Leary himself,\r\nprophet of LSD, does virtual-reality computer-graphics demos in\r\nhis lecture tours.\r\n\r\nJohn Perry Barlow is not a member of the Grateful Dead.  He is, however,\r\na ranking Deadhead.\r\n\r\nBarlow describes himself as a \"techno-crank.\"  A vague term like\r\n\"social activist\" might not be far from the mark, either.\r\nBut Barlow might be better described as a \"poet\"--if one keeps in mind\r\nPercy Shelley's archaic definition of poets as \"unacknowledged legislators\r\nof the world.\"\r\n\r\nBarlow once made a stab at acknowledged legislator status.  In 1987,\r\nhe narrowly missed the Republican nomination for a seat in the\r\nWyoming State Senate.  Barlow is a Wyoming native, the third-generation\r\nscion of a well-to-do cattle-ranching family.  He is in his early forties,\r\nmarried and the father of three daughters.\r\n\r\nBarlow is not much troubled by other people's narrow notions of consistency.\r\nIn the late 1980s, this Republican rock lyricist cattle rancher sold his ranch\r\nand became a computer telecommunications devotee.\r\n\r\nThe free-spirited Barlow made this transition with ease.  He genuinely\r\nenjoyed computers.  With a beep of his modem, he leapt from small-town\r\nPinedale, Wyoming, into electronic contact with a large and lively crowd\r\nof bright, inventive, technological sophisticates from all over the world.\r\nBarlow found the social milieu of computing attractive: its fast-lane pace,\r\nits blue-sky rhetoric, its open-endedness.  Barlow began dabbling in\r\ncomputer journalism, with marked success, as he was a quick study,\r\nand both shrewd and eloquent.  He frequently travelled to San Francisco\r\nto network with Deadhead friends.  There Barlow made extensive contacts\r\nthroughout the Californian computer community, including friendships\r\namong the wilder spirits at Apple.\r\n\r\nIn May 1990, Barlow received a visit from a local Wyoming agent of the FBI.\r\nThe NuPrometheus case had reached Wyoming.\r\n\r\nBarlow was troubled to find himself under investigation in an\r\narea of his interests once quite free of federal attention.\r\nHe had to struggle to explain the very nature of computer-crime\r\nto a headscratching local FBI man who specialized in cattle-rustling.\r\nBarlow, chatting helpfully and demonstrating the wonders of his modem\r\nto the puzzled fed, was alarmed to find all \"hackers\" generally under\r\nFBI suspicion as an evil influence in the electronic community.\r\nThe FBI, in pursuit of a hacker called \"NuPrometheus,\" were tracing\r\nattendees of a suspect group called the Hackers Conference.\r\n\r\nThe Hackers Conference, which had been started in 1984, was a\r\nyearly Californian meeting of digital pioneers and enthusiasts.\r\nThe hackers of the Hackers Conference had little if anything to do\r\nwith the hackers of the digital underground.  On the contrary,\r\nthe hackers of this conference were mostly well-to-do Californian\r\nhigh-tech CEOs, consultants, journalists and entrepreneurs.\r\n(This group of hackers were the exact sort of \"hackers\"\r\nmost likely to react with militant fury at any criminal\r\ndegradation of the term \"hacker.\")\r\n\r\nBarlow, though he was not arrested or accused of a crime,\r\nand though his computer had certainly not gone out the door,\r\nwas very troubled by this anomaly.  He carried the word to the Well.\r\n\r\nLike the Hackers Conference, \"the Well\" was an emanation of the\r\nPoint Foundation.  Point Foundation, the inspiration of a wealthy\r\nCalifornian 60s radical named Stewart Brand, was to be a major\r\nlaunch-pad of the civil libertarian effort.\r\n\r\nPoint Foundation's cultural efforts, like those of their fellow Bay Area\r\nCalifornians the Grateful Dead, were multifaceted and multitudinous.\r\nRigid ideological consistency had never been a strong suit of the\r\nWhole Earth Catalog.  This Point publication had enjoyed a strong\r\nvogue during the late 60s and early 70s, when it offered hundreds\r\nof practical (and not so practical) tips on communitarian living,\r\nenvironmentalism, and getting back-to-the-land.  The Whole Earth Catalog,\r\nand its sequels, sold two and half million copies and won a\r\nNational Book Award.\r\n\r\nWith the slow collapse of American radical dissent, the Whole Earth Catalog\r\nhad slipped to a more modest corner of the cultural radar; but in its\r\nmagazine incarnation, CoEvolution Quarterly, the Point Foundation\r\ncontinued to offer a magpie potpourri of \"access to tools and ideas.\"\r\n\r\nCoEvolution Quarterly, which started in 1974, was never a widely\r\npopular magazine.  Despite periodic outbreaks of millenarian fervor,\r\nCoEvolution Quarterly failed to revolutionize Western civilization\r\nand replace leaden centuries of history with bright new Californian paradigms.\r\nInstead, this propaganda arm of Point Foundation cakewalked a fine line between\r\nimpressive brilliance and New Age flakiness.  CoEvolution Quarterly carried\r\nno advertising, cost a lot, and came out on cheap newsprint with modest\r\nblack-and-white graphics.  It was poorly distributed, and spread mostly\r\nby subscription and word of mouth.\r\n\r\nIt could not seem to grow beyond 30,000 subscribers.\r\nAnd yet--it never seemed to shrink much, either.\r\nYear in, year out, decade in, decade out, some strange\r\ndemographic minority accreted to support the magazine.\r\nThe enthusiastic readership did not seem to have much\r\nin the way of coherent politics or  ideals.  It was sometimes\r\nhard to understand what held them together (if the often bitter\r\ndebate in the letter-columns could be described as \"togetherness\").\r\n\r\nBut if the magazine did not flourish, it was resilient; it got by.\r\nThen, in 1984, the birth-year of the Macintosh computer,\r\nCoEvolution Quarterly suddenly hit the rapids.  Point Foundation\r\nhad discovered the computer revolution.  Out came the Whole Earth\r\nSoftware Catalog of 1984, arousing headscratching doubts among\r\nthe tie-dyed faithful, and rabid enthusiasm among the nascent\r\n\"cyberpunk\" milieu, present company included.  Point Foundation\r\nstarted its yearly Hackers Conference, and began to take an\r\nextensive interest in the strange new possibilities of\r\ndigital counterculture.  CoEvolution Quarterlyfolded its teepee,\r\nreplaced by Whole Earth Software Review and eventually by Whole Earth\r\nReview (the magazine's present incarnation, currently under\r\nthe editorship of virtual-reality maven Howard Rheingold).\r\n\r\n1985 saw the birth of the \"WELL\"--the \"Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link.\"\r\nThe Well was Point Foundation's bulletin board system.\r\n\r\nAs boards went, the Well was an anomaly from the beginning,\r\nand remained one.  It was local to San Francisco.\r\nIt was huge, with multiple phonelines and enormous files\r\nof commentary.  Its complex UNIX-based software might be\r\nmost charitably described as \"user-opaque.\"  It was run on\r\na mainframe out of the rambling offices of a non-profit\r\ncultural foundation in Sausalito.  And it was crammed with\r\nfans of the Grateful Dead.\r\n\r\nThough the Well was peopled by chattering hipsters of the Bay Area\r\ncounterculture, it was by no means a \"digital underground\" board.\r\nTeenagers were fairly scarce; most Well users (known as \"Wellbeings\")\r\nwere thirty- and forty-something Baby Boomers.  They tended to work\r\nin the information industry: hardware, software, telecommunications,\r\nmedia, entertainment.  Librarians, academics, and journalists were\r\nespecially common on the Well, attracted by Point Foundation's\r\nopen-handed distribution of \"tools and ideas.\"\r\n\r\nThere were no anarchy files on the Well, scarcely a\r\ndropped hint about access codes or credit-card theft.\r\nNo one used handles.  Vicious \"flame-wars\" were held to\r\na comparatively civilized rumble.  Debates were sometimes sharp,\r\nbut no Wellbeing ever claimed that a rival had disconnected his phone,\r\ntrashed his house, or posted his credit card numbers.\r\n\r\nThe Well grew slowly as the 1980s advanced.  It charged a modest sum\r\nfor access and storage, and lost money for years--but not enough to hamper\r\nthe Point Foundation, which was nonprofit anyway.  By 1990, the Well\r\nhad about five thousand users.  These users wandered about a gigantic\r\ncyberspace smorgasbord of \"Conferences\", each conference itself consisting\r\nof a welter of \"topics,\" each topic containing dozens, sometimes hundreds\r\nof comments, in a tumbling, multiperson debate that could last for months\r\nor years on end.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1991, the Well's list of conferences looked like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFERENCES ON THE WELL\r\n\r\nWELL \"Screenzine\" Digest  (g zine)\r\n\r\nBest of the WELL -

Each of these conferences\r\nwas a little cyberspace world in itself, comprising dozens and perhaps\r\nhundreds of sub-topics.  Each conference was commonly frequented by\r\na fairly small, fairly like-minded community of perhaps a few dozen people.\r\nIt was humanly impossible to encompass the entire Well (especially since\r\naccess to the Well's mainframe computer was billed by the hour).\r\nMost long-time users contented themselves with a few favorite\r\ntopical neighborhoods, with the occasional foray elsewhere\r\nfor a taste of exotica.  But especially important news items,\r\nand hot topical debates, could catch the attention of the entire\r\nWell community.\r\n\r\nLike any community, the Well had its celebrities, and John Perry Barlow,\r\nthe silver-tongued and silver-modemed lyricist of the Grateful Dead,\r\nranked prominently among them.  It was here on the Well that Barlow\r\nposted his true-life tale of computer-crime encounter with the FBI.\r\n\r\nThe story, as might be expected, created a great stir.  The Well was\r\nalready primed for hacker controversy.  In December 1989, Harper's magazine\r\nhad hosted a debate on the Well about the ethics of illicit computer intrusion.\r\nWhile over forty various computer-mavens took part, Barlow proved a star\r\nin the debate.  So did \"Acid Phreak\" and \"Phiber Optik,\" a pair of young\r\nNew York hacker-phreaks whose skills at telco switching-station intrusion\r\nwere matched only by their apparently limitless hunger for fame.\r\nThe advent of these two boldly swaggering outlaws in the precincts\r\nof the Well created a sensation akin to that of Black Panthers\r\nat a cocktail party for the radically chic.\r\n\r\nPhiber Optik in particular was to seize the day in 1990.\r\nA devotee of the 2600 circle and stalwart of the New York\r\nhackers' group \"Masters of Deception,\" Phiber Optik was\r\na splendid exemplar of the computer intruder as committed dissident.\r\nThe eighteen-year-old Optik, a high-school dropout and part-time\r\ncomputer repairman, was young, smart, and ruthlessly obsessive,\r\na sharp-dressing, sharp-talking digital dude who was utterly\r\nand airily contemptuous of anyone's rules but his own.\r\nBy late 1991, Phiber Optik had appeared in Harper's,\r\nEsquire, The New York Times, in countless public debates\r\nand conventions, even on a television show hosted by Geraldo Rivera.\r\n\r\nTreated with gingerly respect by Barlow and other Well mavens,\r\nPhiber Optik swiftly became a Well celebrity.  Strangely, despite\r\nhis thorny attitude and utter single-mindedness, Phiber Optik seemed\r\nto arouse strong protective instincts in most of the people who met him.\r\nHe was great copy for journalists, always fearlessly ready to swagger,\r\nand, better yet, to actually DEMONSTRATE some off-the-wall digital stunt.\r\nHe was a born media darling.\r\n\r\nEven cops seemed to recognize that there was something peculiarly unworldly\r\nand uncriminal about this particular troublemaker.  He was so bold,\r\nso flagrant, so young, and so obviously doomed, that even those\r\nwho strongly disapproved of his actions grew anxious for his welfare,\r\nand began to flutter about him as if he were an endangered seal pup.\r\n\r\nIn January 24, 1990 (nine days after the Martin Luther King Day Crash),\r\nPhiber Optik, Acid Phreak, and a third NYC scofflaw named Scorpion were\r\nraided by the Secret Service.  Their computers went out the door,\r\nalong with the usual blizzard of papers, notebooks, compact disks,\r\nanswering machines, Sony Walkmans, etc.  Both Acid Phreak and\r\nPhiber Optik were accused of having caused the Crash.\r\n\r\nThe mills of justice ground slowly.  The case eventually fell into\r\nthe hands of the New York State Police.  Phiber had lost his machinery\r\nin the raid, but there were no charges filed against him for over a year.\r\nHis predicament was extensively publicized on the Well, where it caused\r\nmuch resentment for police tactics.  It's one thing to merely hear about\r\na hacker raided or busted; it's another to see the police attacking someone\r\nyou've come to know personally, and who has explained his motives at length.\r\nThrough the Harper's debate on the Well, it had become clear to the\r\nWellbeings that Phiber Optik was not in fact going to \"hurt anything.\"\r\nIn their own salad days, many Wellbeings had tasted tear-gas in pitched\r\nstreet-battles with police.  They were inclined to indulgence for\r\nacts of civil disobedience.\r\n\r\nWellbeings were also startled to learn of the draconian thoroughness\r\nof a typical hacker search-and-seizure.  It took no great stretch of\r\nimagination for them to envision themselves suffering much the same treatment.\r\n\r\nAs early as January 1990, sentiment on the Well had already begun to sour,\r\nand people had begun to grumble that \"hackers\" were getting a raw deal\r\nfrom the ham-handed powers-that-be.  The resultant issue of Harper's\r\nmagazine posed the question as to whether computer-intrusion was a \"crime\"\r\nat all.  As Barlow put it later:  \"I've begun to wonder if we wouldn't\r\nalso regard spelunkers as desperate criminals if AT&T owned all the caves.\"\r\n\r\nIn February 1991, more than a year after the raid on his home,\r\nPhiber Optik was finally arrested, and was charged with first-degree\r\nComputer Tampering and Computer Trespass, New York state offenses.\r\nHe was also charged with a theft-of-service misdemeanor, involving a complex\r\nfree-call scam to a 900 number.  Phiber Optik pled guilty to the misdemeanor\r\ncharge, and was sentenced to  35 hours of community service.\r\n\r\nThis passing harassment from the unfathomable world of straight people\r\nseemed to bother Optik himself little if at all.  Deprived of his computer\r\nby the January search-and-seizure, he simply bought himself a portable\r\ncomputer so the cops could no longer monitor the phone where he lived\r\nwith his Mom, and he went right on with his depredations, sometimes on\r\nlive radio or in front of television cameras.\r\n\r\nThe crackdown raid may have done little to dissuade Phiber Optik,\r\nbut its galling affect on the Wellbeings was profound.  As 1990 rolled on,\r\nthe slings and arrows mounted:  the Knight Lightning raid,\r\nthe Steve Jackson raid, the nation-spanning Operation Sundevil.\r\nThe rhetoric of law enforcement made it clear that there was,\r\nin fact, a concerted crackdown on hackers in progress.\r\n\r\nThe hackers of the Hackers Conference, the Wellbeings, and their ilk,\r\ndid not really mind the occasional public misapprehension of \"hacking;\"\r\nif anything, this membrane of differentiation from straight society\r\nmade the \"computer community\" feel different, smarter, better.\r\nThey had never before been confronted, however, by a concerted\r\nvilification campaign.\r\n\r\nBarlow's central role in the counter-struggle was one of the major\r\nanomalies of 1990.  Journalists investigating the controversy\r\noften stumbled over the truth about Barlow, but they commonly\r\ndusted themselves off and hurried on as if nothing had happened.\r\nIt was as if it were TOO MUCH TO BELIEVE that a 1960s freak\r\nfrom the Grateful Dead had taken on a federal law enforcement operation\r\nhead-to-head and ACTUALLY SEEMED TO BE WINNING!\r\n\r\nBarlow had no easily detectable power-base for a political struggle\r\nof this kind.  He had no formal legal or technical credentials.\r\nBarlow was, however, a computer networker of truly stellar brilliance.\r\nHe had a poet's gift of concise, colorful phrasing.  He also had a\r\njournalist's shrewdness, an off-the-wall, self-deprecating wit,\r\nand a phenomenal wealth of simple personal charm.\r\n\r\nThe kind of influence Barlow possessed is fairly common currency\r\nin literary, artistic, or musical circles.  A gifted critic can\r\nwield great artistic influence simply through defining\r\nthe temper of the times, by coining the catch-phrases\r\nand the terms of debate that become the common currency of the period.\r\n(And as it happened, Barlow WAS a part-time art critic,\r\nwith a special fondness for the Western art of Frederic Remington.)\r\n\r\nBarlow was the first commentator to adopt William Gibson's\r\nstriking science-fictional term \"cyberspace\" as a synonym\r\nfor the present-day nexus of computer and telecommunications networks.\r\nBarlow was insistent that cyberspace should be regarded as\r\na qualitatively new world, a \"frontier.\"  According to Barlow,\r\nthe world of electronic communications, now made visible through\r\nthe computer screen, could no longer be usefully regarded\r\nas just a tangle of high-tech wiring.  Instead, it had become\r\na PLACE, cyberspace, which demanded a new set of metaphors,\r\na new set of rules and behaviors.  The term, as Barlow employed it,\r\nstruck a useful chord, and this concept of cyberspace was picked up\r\nby Time, Scientific American, computer police, hackers, and even\r\nConstitutional scholars.  \"Cyberspace\" now seems likely to become\r\na permanent fixture of the language.\r\n\r\nBarlow was very striking in person: a tall, craggy-faced, bearded,\r\ndeep-voiced Wyomingan in a dashing Western ensemble of jeans, jacket,\r\ncowboy boots, a knotted throat-kerchief and an ever-present Grateful Dead\r\ncloisonne lapel pin.\r\n\r\nArmed with a modem, however, Barlow was truly in his element.\r\nFormal hierarchies were not Barlow's strong suit; he rarely missed\r\na chance to belittle the \"large organizations and their drones,\"\r\nwith their uptight, institutional mindset.  Barlow was very much\r\nof the free-spirit persuasion, deeply unimpressed by brass-hats\r\nand jacks-in-office.  But when it came to the digital grapevine,\r\nBarlow was a cyberspace ad-hocrat par excellence.\r\n\r\nThere was not a mighty army of Barlows.  There was only one Barlow,\r\nand he was a fairly anomolous individual.  However, the situation only\r\nseemed to REQUIRE a single Barlow.  In fact, after 1990, many people\r\nmust have concluded that a single Barlow was far more than\r\nthey'd ever bargained for.\r\n\r\nBarlow's querulous mini-essay about his encounter with the FBI\r\nstruck a strong chord on the Well.  A number of other free spirits\r\non the fringes of Apple Computing had come under suspicion,\r\nand they liked it not one whit better than he did.\r\n\r\nOne of these was Mitchell Kapor, the co-inventor of the spreadsheet\r\nprogram \"Lotus 1-2-3\" and the founder of Lotus Development Corporation.\r\nKapor had written-off the passing indignity of being fingerprinted\r\ndown at his own local Boston FBI headquarters, but Barlow's post\r\nmade the full national scope of the FBI's dragnet clear to Kapor.\r\nThe issue now had Kapor's full attention.  As the Secret Service\r\nswung into anti-hacker operation nationwide in 1990, Kapor watched\r\nevery move with deep skepticism and growing alarm.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Kapor had already met Barlow, who had interviewed Kapor\r\nfor a California computer journal.  Like most people who met Barlow,\r\nKapor had been very taken with him.  Now Kapor took it upon himself\r\nto drop in on Barlow for a heart-to-heart talk about the situation.\r\n\r\nKapor was a regular on the Well.  Kapor had been a devotee of the\r\nWhole Earth Catalogsince the beginning, and treasured a complete run\r\nof the magazine.  And Kapor not only had a modem, but a private jet.\r\nIn pursuit of the scattered high-tech investments of Kapor Enterprises Inc.,\r\nhis personal, multi-million dollar holding company, Kapor commonly crossed\r\nstate lines with about as much thought as one might give to faxing a letter.\r\n\r\nThe Kapor-Barlow council of June 1990, in Pinedale, Wyoming, was the start\r\nof the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Barlow swiftly wrote a manifesto,\r\n\"Crime and Puzzlement,\" which announced his, and Kapor's, intention\r\nto form a political organization to \"raise and disburse funds for education,\r\nlobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the\r\nextension of the Constitution into Cyberspace.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, proclaimed the manifesto, the foundation would\r\n\"fund, conduct, and support legal efforts to demonstrate\r\nthat the Secret Service has exercised prior restraint on publications,\r\nlimited free speech, conducted improper seizure of equipment and data,\r\nused undue force, and generally conducted itself in a fashion which\r\nis arbitrary, oppressive, and unconstitutional.\"\r\n\r\n\"Crime and Puzzlement\" was distributed far and wide through computer\r\nnetworking channels, and also printed in the Whole Earth Review.\r\nThe sudden declaration of a coherent, politicized counter-strike\r\nfrom the ranks of hackerdom electrified the community.  Steve Wozniak\r\n(perhaps a bit stung by the  NuPrometheus scandal) swiftly offered\r\nto match any funds Kapor offered the Foundation.\r\n\r\nJohn Gilmore, one of the pioneers of Sun Microsystems, immediately offered\r\nhis own extensive financial and personal support.  Gilmore, an ardent\r\nlibertarian, was to prove an eloquent advocate of electronic privacy issues,\r\nespecially freedom from governmental and corporate computer-assisted\r\nsurveillance of private citizens.\r\n\r\nA second meeting in San Francisco rounded up further allies:\r\nStewart Brand of the Point Foundation, virtual-reality pioneers\r\nJaron Lanier and Chuck Blanchard, network entrepreneur and venture\r\ncapitalist Nat Goldhaber.  At this dinner meeting, the activists settled on\r\na formal title: the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Incorporated.\r\nKapor became its president. A new EFF Conference was opened on\r\nthe Point Foundation's Well, and the Well was declared\r\n\"the home of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\"\r\n\r\nPress coverage was immediate and intense.  Like their\r\nnineteenth-century spiritual ancestors, Alexander Graham Bell\r\nand Thomas Watson, the high-tech computer entrepreneurs\r\nof the 1970s and 1980s--people such as Wozniak, Jobs, Kapor,\r\nGates, and H. Ross Perot, who had raised themselves by their bootstraps\r\nto dominate a glittering new industry--had always made very good copy.\r\n\r\nBut while the Wellbeings rejoiced, the press in general seemed\r\nnonplussed by the self-declared \"civilizers of cyberspace.\"\r\nEFF's insistence that the war against \"hackers\" involved grave\r\nConstitutional civil liberties issues seemed somewhat farfetched,\r\nespecially since none of EFF's organizers were lawyers\r\nor established politicians.  The business press in particular\r\nfound it easier to seize on the apparent core of the story--\r\nthat high-tech entrepreneur Mitchell Kapor had established\r\na \"defense fund for hackers.\"  Was EFF a genuinely important\r\npolitical development--or merely a clique of wealthy eccentrics,\r\ndabbling in matters better left to the proper authorities?\r\nThe jury was still out.\r\n\r\nBut the stage was now set for open confrontation.\r\nAnd the first and the most critical battle was the\r\nhacker show-trial of \"Knight Lightning.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIt has been my practice throughout this book to refer to hackers\r\nonly by their \"handles.\"  There is little to gain by giving\r\nthe real names of these people, many of whom are juveniles,\r\nmany of whom have never been convicted of any crime, and many\r\nof whom had unsuspecting parents who have already suffered enough.\r\n\r\nBut the trial of Knight Lightning on July 24-27, 1990,\r\nmade this particular \"hacker\" a nationally known public figure.\r\nIt can do no particular harm to himself or his family if I repeat\r\nthe long-established fact that his name is Craig Neidorf (pronounced NYE-dorf).\r\n\r\nNeidorf's jury trial took place in the United States District Court,\r\nNorthern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, with the\r\nHonorable Nicholas J. Bua presiding.  The United States of America\r\nwas the plaintiff, the defendant Mr. Neidorf.  The defendant's attorney\r\nwas Sheldon T. Zenner of the Chicago firm of Katten, Muchin and Zavis.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution was led by the stalwarts of the Chicago Computer Fraud\r\nand Abuse Task Force:  William J. Cook, Colleen D. Coughlin, and\r\nDavid A. Glockner, all Assistant United States Attorneys.\r\nThe Secret Service Case Agent was Timothy M. Foley.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that Neidorf was the co-editor of an underground hacker\r\n\"magazine\" called Phrack.  Phrack was an entirely electronic publication,\r\ndistributed through bulletin boards and over electronic networks.\r\nIt was amateur publication given away for free.  Neidorf had never made\r\nany money for his work in Phrack.  Neither had his unindicted co-editor\r\n\"Taran King\" or any of the numerous Phrack contributors.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force, however,\r\nhad decided to prosecute Neidorf as a fraudster.\r\nTo formally admit that Phrack was a \"magazine\"\r\nand Neidorf a \"publisher\" was to open a prosecutorial\r\nPandora's Box of First Amendment issues.  To do this\r\nwas to play into the hands of Zenner and his EFF advisers,\r\nwhich now included a phalanx of prominent New York civil rights\r\nlawyers as well as the formidable legal staff of Katten, Muchin and Zavis.\r\nInstead, the prosecution relied heavily on the issue of access device fraud:\r\nSection 1029 of Title 18, the section from which the Secret Service drew\r\nits most direct jurisdiction over computer crime.\r\n\r\nNeidorf's alleged crimes centered around the E911 Document.\r\nHe was accused of having entered into a fraudulent scheme with the Prophet,\r\nwho, it will be recalled, was the Atlanta LoD member who had illicitly\r\ncopied the E911 Document from the BellSouth AIMSX system.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet himself was also a co-defendant in the Neidorf case,\r\npart-and-parcel of the alleged \"fraud scheme\" to \"steal\" BellSouth's\r\nE911 Document (and to pass the Document across state lines,\r\nwhich helped establish the Neidorf trial as a federal case).\r\nThe Prophet, in the spirit of full co-operation, had agreed\r\nto testify against Neidorf.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all three of the Atlanta crew stood ready to testify against Neidorf.\r\nTheir own federal prosecutors in Atlanta had charged the Atlanta Three with:\r\n(a) conspiracy, (b) computer fraud, (c) wire fraud, (d) access device fraud,\r\nand (e) interstate transportation of stolen property (Title 18, Sections 371,\r\n1030, 1343, 1029, and 2314).\r\n\r\nFaced with this blizzard of trouble, Prophet and Leftist had ducked\r\nany public trial and had pled guilty to reduced charges--one conspiracy\r\ncount apiece.  Urvile had pled guilty to that odd bit of Section 1029\r\nwhich makes it illegal to possess \"fifteen or more\" illegal access devices\r\n(in his case, computer passwords).  And their sentences were scheduled\r\nfor September 14, 1990--well after the Neidorf trial.  As witnesses,\r\nthey could presumably be relied upon to behave.\r\n\r\nNeidorf, however, was pleading innocent.  Most everyone else caught up\r\nin the crackdown had \"cooperated fully\" and pled guilty in hope\r\nof reduced sentences.  (Steve Jackson was a notable exception,\r\nof course, and had strongly protested his innocence from the\r\nvery beginning.  But Steve Jackson could not get a day in court--\r\nSteve Jackson had never been charged with any crime in the first place.)\r\n\r\nNeidorf had been urged to plead guilty.  But Neidorf was a political science\r\nmajor and was disinclined to go to jail for \"fraud\" when he had not made\r\nany money, had not broken into any computer, and had been publishing\r\na magazine that he considered protected under the First Amendment.\r\n\r\nNeidorf's trial was the ONLY legal action of the entire Crackdown\r\nthat actually involved bringing the issues at hand out for a public test\r\nin front of a jury of American citizens.\r\n\r\nNeidorf, too, had cooperated with investigators.  He had voluntarily\r\nhanded over much of the evidence that had led to his own indictment.\r\nHe had already admitted in writing that he knew that the E911 Document\r\nhad been stolen before he had \"published\" it in Phrack--or, from the\r\nprosecution's point of view, illegally transported stolen property by wire\r\nin something purporting to be a \"publication.\"\r\n\r\nBut even if the \"publication\" of the E911 Document was not held to be a crime,\r\nthat wouldn't let Neidorf off the hook.  Neidorf had still received\r\nthe E911 Document when Prophet had transferred it to him from Rich Andrews'\r\nJolnet node.  On that occasion, it certainly hadn't been \"published\"--\r\nit was hacker booty, pure and simple, transported across state lines.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Task Force led a Chicago grand jury to indict Neidorf\r\non a set of charges that could have put him in jail for thirty years.\r\nWhen some of these charges were successfully challenged before Neidorf\r\nactually went to trial, the Chicago Task Force rearranged his\r\nindictment so that he faced a possible jail term of over sixty years!\r\nAs a first offender, it was very unlikely that Neidorf would in fact\r\nreceive a sentence so drastic; but the Chicago Task Force clearly\r\nintended to see Neidorf put in prison, and his conspiratorial \"magazine\"\r\nput permanently out of commission.  This was a federal case, and Neidorf\r\nwas charged with the fraudulent theft of property worth almost\r\neighty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cook was a strong believer in high-profile prosecutions\r\nwith symbolic overtones.  He often published articles on his work\r\nin the security trade press, arguing that \"a clear message had\r\nto be sent to the public at large and the computer community\r\nin particular that unauthorized attacks on computers and the theft\r\nof computerized information would not be tolerated by the courts.\"\r\n\r\nThe issues were complex, the prosecution's tactics somewhat unorthodox,\r\nbut the Chicago Task Force had proved sure-footed to date.  \"Shadowhawk\"\r\nhad been bagged on the wing in 1989 by the Task Force, and sentenced\r\nto nine months in prison, and a $10,000 fine.  The Shadowhawk case involved\r\ncharges under Section 1030, the \"federal interest computer\" section.\r\n\r\nShadowhawk had not in fact been a devotee of \"federal-interest\" computers\r\nper se.  On the contrary, Shadowhawk, who owned an AT&T home computer,\r\nseemed to cherish a special aggression toward AT&T.  He had bragged on\r\nthe underground boards \"Phreak Klass 2600\" and \"Dr. Ripco\" of his skills\r\nat raiding AT&T, and of his intention to crash AT&T's national phone system.\r\nShadowhawk's brags were noticed by Henry Kluepfel of Bellcore Security,\r\nscourge of the outlaw boards, whose relations with the Chicago Task Force\r\nwere long and intimate.\r\n\r\nThe Task Force successfully established that Section 1030 applied to\r\nthe teenage Shadowhawk, despite the objections of his defense attorney.\r\nShadowhawk had entered a computer \"owned\" by U.S. Missile Command\r\nand merely \"managed\" by AT&T.  He had also entered an AT&T computer\r\nlocated at Robbins Air Force Base in Georgia.  Attacking AT&T was\r\nof \"federal interest\" whether Shadowhawk had intended it or not.\r\n\r\nThe Task Force also convinced the court that a piece of AT&T\r\nsoftware that Shadowhawk had illicitly copied from Bell Labs,\r\nthe \"Artificial Intelligence C5 Expert System,\" was worth a cool\r\none million dollars.  Shadowhawk's attorney had argued that\r\nShadowhawk had not sold the program and had made no profit from\r\nthe illicit copying.  And in point of fact, the C5 Expert System\r\nwas experimental software, and had no established market value\r\nbecause it had never been on the market in the first place.\r\nAT&T's own assessment of a \"one million dollar\" figure for its\r\nown intangible property was accepted without challenge\r\nby the court, however.  And the court concurred with\r\nthe government prosecutors that Shadowhawk showed clear\r\n\"intent to defraud\" whether he'd gotten any money or not.\r\nShadowhawk went to jail.\r\n\r\nThe Task Force's other best-known triumph had been the conviction\r\nand jailing of \"Kyrie.\"  Kyrie, a true denizen of the digital\r\ncriminal underground, was a 36-year-old Canadian woman,\r\nconvicted and jailed for telecommunications fraud in Canada.\r\nAfter her release from prison, she had fled the wrath of Canada Bell\r\nand the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and eventually settled,\r\nvery unwisely, in Chicago.\r\n\r\n\"Kyrie,\" who also called herself \"Long Distance Information,\"\r\nspecialized in voice-mail abuse.  She assembled large numbers\r\nof hot long-distance codes, then read them aloud into a series\r\nof corporate voice-mail systems.  Kyrie and her friends were\r\nelectronic squatters in corporate voice-mail systems,\r\nusing them much as if they were pirate bulletin boards,\r\nthen moving on when their vocal chatter clogged the system\r\nand the owners necessarily wised up.  Kyrie's camp followers\r\nwere a loose tribe of some hundred and fifty phone-phreaks,\r\nwho followed her trail of piracy from machine to machine,\r\nardently begging for her services and expertise.\r\n\r\nKyrie's disciples passed her stolen credit-card numbers,\r\nin exchange for her stolen \"long distance information.\"\r\nSome of Kyrie's clients paid her off in cash, by scamming\r\ncredit-card cash advances from Western Union.\r\n\r\nKyrie travelled incessantly, mostly through airline tickets\r\nand hotel rooms that she scammed through stolen credit cards.\r\nTiring of this, she found refuge with a fellow female phone\r\nphreak in Chicago.  Kyrie's hostess, like a surprising number\r\nof phone phreaks, was blind.  She was also physically disabled.\r\nKyrie allegedly made the best of her new situation by applying for,\r\nand receiving, state welfare funds under a false identity as\r\na qualified caretaker for the handicapped.\r\n\r\nSadly, Kyrie's two children by a former marriage had also vanished\r\nunderground with her; these pre-teen digital refugees had no legal\r\nAmerican identity, and had never spent a day in school.\r\n\r\nKyrie was addicted to technical mastery and enthralled by her own\r\ncleverness and the ardent worship of her teenage followers.\r\nThis foolishly led her to phone up Gail Thackeray in Arizona,\r\nto boast, brag, strut, and offer to play informant.\r\nThackeray, however, had already learned far more\r\nthan enough about Kyrie, whom she roundly despised\r\nas an adult criminal corrupting minors, a \"female Fagin.\"\r\nThackeray passed her tapes of Kyrie's boasts to the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nKyrie was raided and arrested in Chicago in May 1989.\r\nShe confessed at great length and pled guilty.\r\n\r\nIn August 1990, Cook and his Task Force colleague Colleen Coughlin\r\nsent Kyrie to jail for 27 months, for computer and telecommunications fraud.\r\nThis was a markedly severe sentence by the usual wrist-slapping standards\r\nof \"hacker\" busts.  Seven of Kyrie's foremost teenage disciples were also\r\nindicted and convicted.  The Kyrie \"high-tech street gang,\" as Cook\r\ndescribed it, had been crushed.  Cook and his colleagues had been\r\nthe first ever to put someone in prison for voice-mail abuse.\r\nTheir pioneering efforts had won them attention and kudos.\r\n\r\nIn his article on Kyrie, Cook drove the message home to the readers\r\nof Security Management magazine, a trade journal for corporate\r\nsecurity professionals.  The case, Cook said, and Kyrie's stiff sentence,\r\n\"reflect a new reality for hackers and computer crime victims in the\r\n'90s. . . .  Individuals and corporations who report computer\r\nand telecommunications crimes can now expect that their cooperation\r\nwith federal law enforcement will result in meaningful punishment.\r\nCompanies and the public at large must report computer-enhanced\r\ncrimes if they want prosecutors and the course to protect their rights\r\nto the tangible and intangible property developed and stored on computers.\"\r\n\r\nCook had made it his business to construct this \"new reality for hackers.\"\r\nHe'd also made it his business to police corporate property rights\r\nto the intangible.\r\n\r\nHad the Electronic Frontier Foundation been a \"hacker defense fund\"\r\nas that term was generally understood, they presumably would have stood up\r\nfor Kyrie.  Her 1990 sentence did indeed send a \"message\" that federal heat\r\nwas coming down on \"hackers.\"  But Kyrie found no defenders at EFF,\r\nor anywhere else, for that matter.  EFF was not a bail-out fund\r\nfor electronic crooks.\r\n\r\nThe Neidorf case paralleled the Shadowhawk case in certain ways.\r\nThe victim once again was allowed to set the value of the \"stolen\" property.\r\nOnce again Kluepfel was both investigator and technical advisor.\r\nOnce again no money had changed hands, but the \"intent to defraud\" was central.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution's case showed signs of weakness early on.  The Task Force\r\nhad originally hoped to prove Neidorf the center of a nationwide\r\nLegion of Doom criminal conspiracy.  The Phrack editors threw physical\r\nget-togethers every summer, which attracted hackers from across the country;\r\ngenerally two dozen or so of the magazine's favorite contributors and readers.\r\n(Such conventions were common in the hacker community; 2600 Magazine,\r\nfor instance, held public meetings of hackers in New York, every month.)\r\nLoD heavy-dudes were always a strong presence at these Phrack-sponsored\r\n\"Summercons.\"\r\n\r\nIn July 1988, an Arizona hacker named \"Dictator\" attended Summercon\r\nin Neidorf's home town of St. Louis.  Dictator was one of Gail Thackeray's\r\nunderground informants; Dictator's underground board in Phoenix was\r\na sting operation for the Secret Service.  Dictator brought an undercover\r\ncrew of Secret Service agents to Summercon.  The agents bored spyholes\r\nthrough the wall of Dictator's hotel room in St Louis, and videotaped\r\nthe frolicking hackers through a one-way mirror.  As it happened,\r\nhowever, nothing illegal had occurred on videotape, other than the\r\nguzzling of beer by a couple of minors.  Summercons were social events,\r\nnot sinister cabals.  The tapes showed fifteen hours of raucous laughter,\r\npizza-gobbling, in-jokes and back-slapping.\r\n\r\nNeidorf's lawyer, Sheldon Zenner, saw the Secret Service tapes\r\nbefore the trial.  Zenner was shocked by the complete harmlessness\r\nof this meeting, which Cook had earlier characterized as a sinister\r\ninterstate conspiracy to commit fraud.  Zenner wanted to show the\r\nSummercon tapes to the jury.  It took protracted maneuverings\r\nby the Task Force to keep the tapes from the jury as \"irrelevant.\"\r\n\r\nThe E911 Document was also proving a weak reed.  It had originally\r\nbeen valued at $79,449.  Unlike Shadowhawk's arcane Artificial Intelligence\r\nbooty, the E911 Document was not software--it was written in English.\r\nComputer-knowledgeable people found this value--for a twelve-page\r\nbureaucratic document--frankly incredible.  In his \"Crime and Puzzlement\"\r\nmanifesto for EFF, Barlow commented:  \"We will probably never know how\r\nthis figure was reached or by whom, though I like to imagine an appraisal\r\nteam consisting of Franz Kafka, Joseph Heller, and Thomas Pynchon.\"\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Barlow was unduly pessimistic.  The EFF did, in fact,\r\neventually discover exactly how this figure was reached, and by whom--\r\nbut only in 1991, long after the Neidorf trial was over.\r\n\r\nKim Megahee, a Southern Bell security manager,\r\nhad arrived at the document's value by simply adding up\r\nthe \"costs associated with the production\" of the E911 Document.\r\nThose \"costs\" were as follows:\r\n\r\n1.  A technical writer had been hired to research and write the E911 Document.\r\n    200 hours of work, at $35 an hour, cost : $7,000.  A Project Manager had\r\n    overseen the technical writer.  200 hours, at $31 an hour, made: $6,200.\r\n\r\n2.  A week of typing had cost $721 dollars.  A week of formatting had\r\n    cost $721.  A week of graphics formatting had cost $742.\r\n\r\n3.  Two days of editing cost $367.\r\n\r\n4.  A box of order labels cost five dollars.\r\n\r\n5.  Preparing a purchase order for the Document, including typing\r\n    and the obtaining of an authorizing signature from within the\r\n    BellSouth bureaucracy, cost $129.\r\n\r\n6.  Printing cost $313.  Mailing the Document to fifty people\r\n    took fifty hours by a clerk, and cost $858.\r\n\r\n7.  Placing the Document in an index took two clerks an hour each,\r\n    totalling $43.\r\n\r\nBureaucratic overhead alone, therefore, was alleged to have cost\r\na whopping $17,099.  According to Mr. Megahee, the typing\r\nof a twelve-page document had taken a full week.  Writing it\r\nhad taken five weeks, including an overseer who apparently\r\ndid nothing else but watch the author for five weeks.\r\nEditing twelve pages had taken two days.  Printing and mailing\r\nan electronic document (which was already available on the\r\nSouthern Bell Data Network to any telco employee who needed it),\r\nhad cost over a thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nBut this was just the beginning.  There were also the HARDWARE EXPENSES.\r\nEight hundred fifty dollars for a VT220 computer monitor.\r\nTHIRTY-ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS for a sophisticated VAXstation II computer.\r\nSix thousand dollars for a computer printer.  TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS\r\nfor a copy of \"Interleaf\" software.  Two thousand five hundred dollars\r\nfor VMS software.  All this to create the twelve-page Document.\r\n\r\nPlus ten percent of the cost of the software and the hardware, for maintenance.\r\n(Actually, the ten percent maintenance costs, though mentioned, had been left\r\noff the final $79,449 total, apparently through a merciful oversight).\r\n\r\nMr. Megahee's letter had been mailed directly to William Cook himself,\r\nat the office of the Chicago federal attorneys.  The United States Government\r\naccepted these telco figures without question.\r\n\r\nAs incredulity mounted, the value of the E911 Document was officially\r\nrevised downward.  This time, Robert Kibler of BellSouth Security\r\nestimated the value of the twelve pages as a mere $24,639.05--based,\r\npurportedly, on \"R&D costs.\"  But this specific estimate,\r\nright down to the nickel, did not move the skeptics at all;\r\nin fact it provoked open scorn and a torrent of sarcasm.\r\n\r\nThe financial issues concerning theft of proprietary information\r\nhave always been peculiar.  It could be argued that BellSouth\r\nhad not \"lost\" its E911 Document at all in the first place,\r\nand therefore had not suffered any monetary damage from this \"theft.\"\r\nAnd Sheldon Zenner did in fact argue this at Neidorf's trial--\r\nthat Prophet's raid had not been \"theft,\" but was better understood\r\nas illicit copying.\r\n\r\nThe money, however, was not central to anyone's true purposes in this trial.\r\nIt was not Cook's strategy to convince the jury that the E911 Document\r\nwas a major act of theft and should be punished for that reason alone.\r\nHis strategy was to argue that the E911 Document was DANGEROUS.\r\nIt was his intention to establish that the E911 Document was \"a road-map\"\r\nto the Enhanced 911 System.  Neidorf had deliberately and recklessly\r\ndistributed a dangerous weapon.  Neidorf and the Prophet did not care\r\n(or perhaps even gloated at the sinister idea) that the E911 Document\r\ncould be used by hackers to disrupt 911 service, \"a life line for every\r\nperson certainly in the Southern Bell region of the United States,\r\nand indeed, in many communities throughout the United States,\"\r\nin Cook's own words.  Neidorf had put people's lives in danger.\r\n\r\nIn pre-trial maneuverings, Cook had established that the E911 Document\r\nwas too hot to appear in the public proceedings of the Neidorf trial.\r\nThe JURY ITSELF would not be allowed to ever see this Document,\r\nlest it slip into the official court records, and thus into the hands\r\nof the general public, and, thus, somehow, to malicious hackers\r\nwho might lethally abuse it.\r\n\r\nHiding the E911 Document from the jury may have been a\r\nclever legal maneuver, but it had a severe flaw.  There were,\r\nin point of fact, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people,\r\nalready in possession of the E911 Document, just as Phrack\r\nhad published it.  Its true nature was already obvious\r\nto a wide section of the interested public (all of whom,\r\nby the way, were, at least theoretically, party to\r\na gigantic wire-fraud conspiracy).  Most everyone\r\nin the electronic community who had a modem and any\r\ninterest in the Neidorf case already had a copy of the Document.\r\nIt had already been available in Phrack for over a year.\r\n\r\nPeople, even quite normal people without any particular\r\nprurient interest in forbidden knowledge, did not shut their eyes\r\nin terror at the thought of beholding a \"dangerous\" document\r\nfrom a telephone company.  On the contrary, they tended to trust\r\ntheir own judgement and simply read the Document for themselves.\r\nAnd they were not impressed.\r\n\r\nOne such person was John Nagle.  Nagle was a  forty-one-year-old\r\nprofessional programmer with a masters' degree in computer science\r\nfrom Stanford.  He had worked for Ford Aerospace, where he had invented\r\na computer-networking technique known as the \"Nagle Algorithm,\"\r\nand for the prominent Californian computer-graphics firm \"Autodesk,\"\r\nwhere he was a major stockholder.\r\n\r\nNagle was also a prominent figure on the Well, much respected\r\nfor his technical knowledgeability.\r\n\r\nNagle had followed the civil-liberties debate closely,\r\nfor he was an ardent telecommunicator.  He was no particular friend\r\nof computer intruders, but he believed electronic publishing\r\nhad a great deal to offer society at large, and attempts\r\nto restrain its growth, or to censor free electronic expression,\r\nstrongly roused his ire.\r\n\r\nThe Neidorf case, and the E911 Document, were both being discussed\r\nin detail on the Internet, in an electronic publication called Telecom Digest.\r\nNagle, a longtime Internet maven, was a regular reader of Telecom Digest.\r\nNagle had never seen a copy of Phrack, but the implications of the case\r\ndisturbed him.\r\n\r\nWhile in a Stanford bookstore hunting books on robotics,\r\nNagle happened across a book called The Intelligent Network.\r\nThumbing through it at random, Nagle came across an entire chapter\r\nmeticulously detailing the workings of E911 police emergency systems.\r\nThis extensive text was being sold openly, and yet in Illinois\r\na young man was in danger of going to prison for publishing\r\na thin six-page document about 911 service.\r\n\r\nNagle made an ironic comment to this effect in Telecom Digest.\r\nFrom there, Nagle was put in touch with Mitch Kapor,\r\nand then with Neidorf's lawyers.\r\n\r\nSheldon Zenner was delighted to find a computer telecommunications expert\r\nwilling to speak up for Neidorf, one who was not a wacky teenage \"hacker.\"\r\nNagle was fluent, mature, and respectable; he'd once had a federal\r\nsecurity clearance.\r\n\r\nNagle was asked to fly to Illinois to join the defense team.\r\n\r\nHaving joined the defense as an expert witness, Nagle read the entire\r\nE911 Document for himself.  He made his own judgement about its potential\r\nfor menace.\r\n\r\nThe time has now come for you yourself, the reader, to have a look\r\nat the E911 Document.  This six-page piece of work was the pretext\r\nfor a federal prosecution that could have sent an electronic publisher\r\nto prison for thirty, or even sixty, years.  It was the pretext\r\nfor the search and seizure of Steve Jackson Games, a legitimate publisher\r\nof printed books.  It was also the formal pretext for the search\r\nand seizure of the Mentor's bulletin board, \"Phoenix Project,\"\r\nand for the raid on the home of Erik Bloodaxe.  It also had much\r\nto do with the seizure of Richard Andrews' Jolnet node\r\nand the shutdown of Charles Boykin's AT&T node.\r\nThe E911 Document was the single most important piece\r\nof evidence in the Hacker Crackdown.  There can be no real\r\nand legitimate substitute for the Document itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n==Phrack Inc.==\r\n\r\nVolume Two, Issue 24, File 5 of 13\r\n\r\nControl Office Administration\r\nOf Enhanced 911 Services For\r\nSpecial Services and Account Centers\r\n\r\nby the Eavesdropper\r\n\r\nMarch, 1988\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Service\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThe control office for Emergency 911 service is assigned in\r\naccordance with the existing standard guidelines to one of\r\nthe following centers:\r\n\r\no  Special Services Center (SSC)\r\no  Major Accounts Center (MAC)\r\no  Serving Test Center (STC)\r\no  Toll Control Center (TCC)\r\n\r\nThe SSC/MAC designation is used in this document interchangeably\r\nfor any of these four centers.  The Special Services Centers (SSCs)\r\nor Major Account Centers (MACs) have been designated as the trouble\r\nreporting contact for all E911 customer (PSAP) reported troubles.\r\nSubscribers who have trouble on an E911 call will continue\r\nto contact local repair service (CRSAB) who will refer the\r\ntrouble to the SSC/MAC, when appropriate.\r\n\r\nDue to the critical nature of E911 service, the control\r\nand timely repair of troubles is demanded.  As the primary\r\nE911 customer contact, the SSC/MAC is in the unique position\r\nto monitor the status of the trouble and insure its resolution.\r\n\r\nSystem Overview\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThe number 911 is intended as a nationwide universal\r\ntelephone number which provides the public with direct\r\naccess to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).  A PSAP\r\nis also referred to as an Emergency Service Bureau (ESB).\r\nA PSAP is an agency or facility which is authorized by a\r\nmunicipality to receive and respond to police, fire and/or\r\nambulance services.  One or more attendants are located\r\nat the PSAP facilities to receive and handle calls of an\r\nemergency nature in accordance with the local municipal\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nAn important advantage of E911 emergency service is\r\nimproved (reduced) response times for emergency\r\nservices.  Also close coordination among agencies\r\nproviding various emergency services is a valuable\r\ncapability provided by E911 service.\r\n\r\n1A ESS is used as the tandem office for the E911 network to\r\nroute all 911 calls to the correct (primary) PSAP designated\r\nto serve the calling station.  The E911 feature was\r\ndeveloped primarily to provide routing to the correct PSAP\r\nfor all 911 calls.  Selective routing allows a 911 call\r\noriginated from a particular station located in a particular\r\ndistrict, zone, or town, to be routed to the primary PSAP\r\ndesignated to serve that customer station regardless of\r\nwire center boundaries.  Thus, selective routing eliminates\r\nthe problem of wire center boundaries not coinciding with\r\ndistrict or other political boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe services available with the E911 feature include:\r\n\r\nForced Disconnect       Default Routing\r\nAlternative Routing     Night Service\r\nSelective Routing       Automatic Number\r\nIdentification (ANI)\r\nSelective Transfer      Automatic Location\r\nIdentification (ALI)\r\n\r\n\r\nPreservice/Installation Guidelines\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nWhen a contract for an E911 system has been signed, it is\r\nthe responsibility of Network Marketing to establish an\r\nimplementation/cutover committee which should include\r\na representative from the SSC/MAC.  Duties of the E911\r\nImplementation Team include coordination of all phases\r\nof the E911 system deployment and the formation of an\r\non-going E911 maintenance subcommittee.\r\n\r\nMarketing is responsible for providing the following\r\ncustomer specific information to the SSC/MAC prior to\r\nthe start of call through testing:\r\n\r\no  All PSAP's (name, address, local contact)\r\no  All PSAP circuit ID's\r\no  1004 911 service request including PSAP details on each PSAP\r\n   (1004 Section K, L, M)\r\no  Network configuration\r\no  Any vendor information (name, telephone number, equipment)\r\n\r\nThe SSC/MAC needs to know if the equipment and sets\r\nat the PSAP are maintained by the BOCs, an independent\r\ncompany, or an outside vendor, or any combination.\r\nThis information is then entered on the PSAP profile sheets\r\nand reviewed quarterly for changes, additions and deletions.\r\n\r\nMarketing will secure the Major Account Number (MAN)\r\nand provide this number to Corporate Communications\r\nso that the initial issue of the service orders carry\r\nthe MAN and can be tracked by the SSC/MAC via CORDNET.\r\nPSAP circuits are official services by definition.\r\n\r\nAll service orders required for the installation of the E911\r\nsystem should include the MAN assigned to the city/county\r\nwhich has purchased the system.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the basic SSC/MAC strategy for provisioning,\r\nthe SSC/MAC will be Overall Control Office (OCO) for all Node\r\nto PSAP circuits (official services) and any other services\r\nfor this customer.  Training must be scheduled for all SSC/MAC\r\ninvolved personnel during the pre-service stage of the project.\r\n\r\nThe E911 Implementation Team will form the on-going\r\nmaintenance subcommittee prior to the initial\r\nimplementation of the E911 system.  This sub-committee\r\nwill establish post implementation quality assurance\r\nprocedures to ensure that the E911 system continues to\r\nprovide quality service to the customer.\r\nCustomer/Company training, trouble reporting interfaces\r\nfor the customer, telephone company and any involved\r\nindependent telephone companies needs to be addressed\r\nand implemented prior to E911 cutover.  These functions\r\ncan be best addressed by the formation of a sub-\r\ncommittee of the E911 Implementation Team to set up\r\nguidelines for and to secure service commitments of\r\ninterfacing organizations.  A SSC/MAC supervisor should\r\nchair this subcommittee and include the following\r\norganizations:\r\n\r\n1) Switching Control Center\r\n - E911 translations\r\n - Trunking\r\n - End office and Tandem office hardware/software\r\n2) Recent Change Memory Administration Center\r\n - Daily RC update activity for TN/ESN translations\r\n - Processes validity errors and rejects\r\n3) Line and Number Administration\r\n - Verification of TN/ESN translations\r\n4) Special Service Center/Major Account Center\r\n - Single point of contact for all PSAP and Node to host troubles\r\n - Logs, tracks & statusing of all trouble reports\r\n - Trouble referral, follow up, and escalation\r\n - Customer notification of status and restoration\r\n - Analyzation of \"chronic\" troubles\r\n - Testing, installation and maintenance of E911 circuits\r\n5) Installation and Maintenance (SSIM/I&M)\r\n - Repair and maintenance of PSAP equipment and Telco owned sets\r\n6) Minicomputer Maintenance Operations Center\r\n - E911 circuit maintenance (where applicable)\r\n7) Area Maintenance Engineer\r\n - Technical assistance on voice (CO-PSAP) network related E911 troubles\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintenance Guidelines\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThe CCNC will test the Node circuit from the 202T at the\r\nHost site to the 202T at the Node site.  Since Host to Node\r\n(CCNC to MMOC) circuits are official company services,\r\nthe CCNC will refer all Node circuit troubles to the\r\nSSC/MAC. The SSC/MAC is responsible for the testing\r\nand follow up to restoration of these circuit troubles.\r\n\r\nAlthough Node to PSAP circuit are official services, the\r\nMMOC will refer PSAP circuit troubles to the appropriate\r\nSSC/MAC.  The SSC/MAC is responsible for testing and\r\nfollow up to restoration of PSAP circuit troubles.\r\n\r\nThe SSC/MAC will also receive reports from\r\nCRSAB/IMC(s) on subscriber 911 troubles when they are\r\nnot line troubles.  The SSC/MAC is responsible for testing\r\nand restoration of these troubles.\r\n\r\nMaintenance responsibilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nSCC@           Voice Network (ANI to PSAP)\r\n@SCC responsible for tandem switch\r\n\r\nSSIM/I&M        PSAP Equipment (Modems, CIU's, sets)\r\nVendor          PSAP Equipment (when CPE)\r\nSSC/MAC         PSAP to Node circuits, and tandem to\r\n                PSAP voice circuits (EMNT)\r\nMMOC            Node site (Modems, cables, etc)\r\n\r\nNote:  All above work groups are required to resolve troubles\r\nby interfacing with appropriate work groups for resolution.\r\n\r\nThe Switching Control Center (SCC) is responsible for\r\nE911/1AESS translations in tandem central offices.\r\nThese translations route E911 calls, selective transfer,\r\ndefault routing, speed calling, etc., for each PSAP.\r\nThe SCC is also responsible for troubleshooting on\r\nthe voice network (call originating to end office tandem equipment).\r\n\r\nFor example, ANI failures in the originating offices would\r\nbe a responsibility of the SCC.\r\n\r\nRecent Change Memory Administration Center (RCMAC) performs\r\nthe daily tandem translation updates (recent change)\r\nfor routing of individual telephone numbers.\r\n\r\nRecent changes are generated from service order activity\r\n(new service, address changes, etc.) and compiled into\r\na daily file by the E911 Center (ALI/DMS E911 Computer).\r\n\r\nSSIM/I&M is responsible for the installation and repair of\r\nPSAP equipment. PSAP equipment includes ANI Controller,\r\nALI Controller, data sets, cables, sets, and other peripheral\r\nequipment that is not vendor owned. SSIM/I&M is responsible\r\nfor establishing maintenance test kits, complete with spare parts\r\nfor PSAP maintenance. This includes test gear, data sets,\r\nand ANI/ALI Controller parts.\r\n\r\nSpecial Services Center (SSC) or Major Account Center\r\n(MAC) serves as the trouble reporting contact for all\r\n(PSAP) troubles reported by customer.  The SSC/MAC\r\nrefers troubles to proper organizations for handling and\r\ntracks status of troubles, escalating when necessary.\r\nThe SSC/MAC will close out troubles with customer.\r\nThe SSC/MAC will analyze all troubles and tracks \"chronic\"\r\nPSAP troubles.\r\n\r\nCorporate Communications Network Center (CCNC) will\r\ntest and refer troubles on all node to host circuits.\r\nAll E911 circuits are classified as official company property.\r\n\r\nThe Minicomputer Maintenance Operations Center\r\n(MMOC) maintains the E911 (ALI/DMS) computer\r\nhardware at the Host site.  This MMOC is also responsible\r\nfor monitoring the system and reporting certain PSAP\r\nand system problems to the local MMOC's, SCC's or\r\nSSC/MAC's.  The MMOC personnel also operate software\r\nprograms that maintain the TN data base under the\r\ndirection of the E911 Center. The maintenance of the\r\nNODE computer (the interface between the PSAP and the\r\nALI/DMS computer) is a function of the MMOC at the\r\nNODE site.  The MMOC's at the NODE sites may also be\r\ninvolved in the testing of NODE to Host circuits.\r\nThe MMOC will also assist on Host to PSAP and data network\r\nrelated troubles not resolved through standard trouble\r\nclearing procedures.\r\n\r\nInstallation And Maintenance Center (IMC) is responsible\r\nfor referral of E911 subscriber troubles that are not subscriber\r\nline problems.\r\n\r\nE911 Center - Performs the role of System Administration\r\nand is responsible for overall operation of the E911\r\ncomputer software.  The E911 Center does A-Z trouble\r\nanalysis and provides statistical information on the\r\nperformance of the system.\r\n\r\nThis analysis includes processing PSAP inquiries (trouble\r\nreports) and referral of network troubles.  The E911 Center\r\nalso performs daily processing of tandem recent change\r\nand provides information to the RCMAC for tandem input.\r\nThe E911 Center is responsible for daily processing\r\nof the ALI/DMS computer data base and provides error files,\r\netc. to the Customer Services department for investigation and correction.\r\nThe E911 Center participates in all system implementations and on-going\r\nmaintenance effort and assists in the development of procedures,\r\ntraining and education of information to all groups.\r\n\r\nAny group receiving a 911 trouble from the SSC/MAC should\r\nclose out the trouble with the SSC/MAC or provide a status\r\nif the trouble has been referred to another group.\r\nThis will allow the SSC/MAC to provide a status back\r\nto the customer or escalate as appropriate.\r\n\r\nAny group receiving a trouble from the Host site (MMOC\r\nor CCNC) should close the trouble back to that group.\r\n\r\nThe MMOC should notify the appropriate SSC/MAC\r\nwhen the Host, Node, or all Node circuits are down so that\r\nthe SSC/MAC can reply to customer reports that may be\r\ncalled in by the PSAPs.  This will eliminate duplicate\r\nreporting of troubles. On complete outages the MMOC\r\nwill follow escalation procedures for a Node after two (2)\r\nhours and for a PSAP after four (4) hours.  Additionally the\r\nMMOC will notify the appropriate SSC/MAC when the\r\nHost, Node, or all Node circuits are down.\r\n\r\nThe PSAP will call the SSC/MAC to report E911 troubles.\r\nThe person reporting the E911 trouble may not have a\r\ncircuit I.D. and will therefore report the PSAP name and\r\naddress.  Many PSAP troubles are not circuit specific.  In\r\nthose instances where the caller cannot provide a circuit\r\nI.D., the SSC/MAC will be required to determine the\r\ncircuit I.D. using the PSAP profile.  Under no circumstances\r\nwill the SSC/MAC Center refuse to take the trouble.\r\nThe E911 trouble should be handled as quickly as possible,\r\nwith the SSC/MAC providing as much assistance as\r\npossible while taking the trouble report from the caller.\r\n\r\nThe SSC/MAC will screen/test the trouble to determine the\r\nappropriate handoff organization based on the following criteria:\r\n\r\nPSAP equipment problem:  SSIM/I&M\r\nCircuit problem:  SSC/MAC\r\nVoice network problem:  SCC (report trunk group number)\r\nProblem affecting multiple PSAPs (No ALI report from\r\nall PSAPs):  Contact the MMOC to check for NODE or\r\nHost computer problems before further testing.\r\n\r\nThe SSC/MAC will track the status of reported troubles\r\nand escalate as appropriate.  The SSC/MAC will close out\r\ncustomer/company reports with the initiating contact.\r\nGroups with specific maintenance responsibilities,\r\ndefined above, will investigate \"chronic\" troubles upon\r\nrequest from the SSC/MAC and the ongoing maintenance subcommittee.\r\n\r\nAll \"out of service\" E911 troubles are priority one type reports.\r\nOne link down to a PSAP is considered a priority one trouble\r\nand should be handled as if the PSAP was isolated.\r\n\r\nThe PSAP will report troubles with the ANI controller, ALI\r\ncontroller or set equipment to the SSC/MAC.\r\n\r\nNO ANI:  Where the PSAP reports NO ANI (digital\r\ndisplay screen is blank) ask if this condition exists on all\r\nscreens and on all calls.  It is important to differentiate\r\nbetween blank screens and screens displaying 911-00XX,\r\nor all zeroes.\r\n\r\nWhen the PSAP reports all screens on all calls, ask if there\r\nis any voice contact with callers.  If there is no voice\r\ncontact the trouble should be referred to the SCC\r\nimmediately since 911 calls are not getting through which\r\nmay require alternate routing of calls to another PSAP.\r\n\r\nWhen the PSAP reports this condition on all screens\r\nbut not all calls and has voice contact with callers,\r\nthe report should be referred to SSIM/I&M for dispatch.\r\nThe SSC/MAC should verify with the SCC that ANI\r\nis pulsing before dispatching SSIM.\r\n\r\nWhen the PSAP reports this condition on one screen for\r\nall calls (others work fine) the trouble should be referred\r\nto SSIM/I&M for dispatch, because the trouble is isolated to\r\none piece of equipment at the customer premise.\r\n\r\nAn ANI failure (i.e. all zeroes) indicates that the ANI has\r\nnot been received by the PSAP from the tandem office or\r\nwas lost by the PSAP ANI controller.  The PSAP may\r\nreceive \"02\" alarms which can be caused by the ANI\r\ncontroller logging more than three all zero failures on the\r\nsame trunk.  The PSAP has been instructed to report this\r\ncondition to the SSC/MAC since it could indicate an\r\nequipment trouble at the PSAP which might be affecting\r\nall subscribers calling into the PSAP.  When all zeroes are\r\nbeing received on all calls or \"02\" alarms continue, a tester\r\nshould analyze the condition to determine the appropriate\r\naction to be taken.  The tester must perform cooperative\r\ntesting with the SCC when there appears to be a problem\r\non the Tandem-PSAP trunks before requesting dispatch.\r\n\r\nWhen an occasional all zero condition is reported,\r\nthe SSC/MAC should dispatch SSIM/I&M to routine\r\nequipment on a \"chronic\" troublesweep.\r\n\r\nThe PSAPs are instructed to report incidental ANI failures\r\nto the BOC on a PSAP inquiry trouble ticket (paper) that\r\nis sent to the Customer Services E911 group and forwarded\r\nto E911 center when required.  This usually involves only a\r\nparticular telephone number and is not a condition that\r\nwould require a report to the SSC/MAC.  Multiple ANI\r\nfailures which our from the same end office (XX denotes\r\nend office), indicate a hard trouble condition may exist\r\nin the end office or end office tandem trunks.  The PSAP will\r\nreport this type of condition to the SSC/MAC and the\r\nSSC/MAC should refer the report to the SCC responsible\r\nfor the tandem office.  NOTE: XX is the ESCO (Emergency\r\nService Number) associated with the incoming 911 trunks\r\ninto the tandem.  It is important that the C/MAC tell the\r\nSCC what is displayed at the PSAP (i.e. 911-0011) which\r\nindicates to the SCC which end office is in trouble.\r\n\r\nNote:  It is essential that the PSAP fill out inquiry form\r\non every ANI failure.\r\n\r\nThe PSAP will report a trouble any time an address is not\r\nreceived on an address display (screen blank) E911 call.\r\n(If a record is not in the 911 data base or an ANI failure\r\nis encountered, the screen will provide a display noticing\r\nsuch condition).  The SSC/MAC should verify with the PSAP\r\nwhether the NO ALI condition is on one screen or all screens.\r\n\r\nWhen the condition is on one screen (other screens\r\nreceive ALI information) the SSC/MAC will request\r\nSSIM/I&M to dispatch.\r\n\r\nIf no screens are receiving ALI information, there is usually\r\na circuit trouble between the PSAP and the Host computer.\r\nThe SSC/MAC should test the trouble and refer for restoral.\r\n\r\nNote:  If the SSC/MAC receives calls from multiple\r\nPSAP's, all of which are receiving NO ALI, there is a\r\nproblem with the Node or Node to Host circuits or the\r\nHost computer itself.  Before referring the trouble the\r\nSSC/MAC should call the MMOC to inquire if the Node\r\nor Host is in trouble.\r\n\r\nAlarm conditions on the ANI controller digital display at\r\nthe PSAP are to be reported by the PSAP's.  These alarms\r\ncan indicate various trouble conditions so the SSC/MAC\r\nshould ask the PSAP if any portion of the E911 system\r\nis not functioning properly.\r\n\r\nThe SSC/MAC should verify with the PSAP attendant that\r\nthe equipment's primary function is answering E911 calls.\r\nIf it is, the SSC/MAC should request a dispatch SSIM/I&M.\r\nIf the equipment is not primarily used for E911,\r\nthen the SSC/MAC should advise PSAP to contact their CPE vendor.\r\n\r\nNote:  These troubles can be quite confusing when the\r\nPSAP has vendor equipment mixed in with equipment\r\nthat the BOC maintains.  The Marketing representative\r\nshould provide the SSC/MAC information concerning any\r\nunusual or exception items where the PSAP should\r\ncontact their vendor.  This information should be included\r\nin the PSAP profile sheets.\r\n\r\nANI or ALI controller down:  When the host computer sees\r\nthe PSAP equipment down and it does not come back up,\r\nthe MMOC will report the trouble to the SSC/MAC;\r\nthe equipment is down at the PSAP, a dispatch will be required.\r\n\r\nPSAP link (circuit) down:  The MMOC will provide the\r\nSSC/MAC with the circuit ID that the Host computer\r\nindicates in trouble.  Although each PSAP has two circuits,\r\nwhen either circuit is down the condition must be treated\r\nas an emergency since failure of the second circuit will\r\ncause the PSAP to be isolated.\r\n\r\nAny problems that the MMOC identifies from the Node\r\nlocation to the Host computer will be handled directly\r\nwith the appropriate MMOC(s)/CCNC.\r\n\r\nNote:  The customer will call only when a problem is\r\napparent to the PSAP. When only one circuit is down to\r\nthe PSAP, the customer may not be aware there is a\r\ntrouble, even though there is one link down,\r\nnotification should appear on the PSAP screen.\r\nTroubles called into the SSC/MAC from the MMOC\r\nor other company employee should not be closed out\r\nby calling the PSAP since it may result in the\r\ncustomer responding that they do not have a trouble.\r\nThese reports can only be closed out by receiving\r\ninformation that the trouble was fixed and by checking\r\nwith the company employee that reported the trouble.\r\nThe MMOC personnel will be able to verify that the\r\ntrouble has cleared by reviewing a printout from the host.\r\n\r\nWhen the CRSAB receives a subscriber complaint\r\n(i.e., cannot dial 911) the RSA should obtain as much\r\ninformation as possible while the customer is on the line.\r\n\r\nFor example, what happened when the subscriber dialed 911?\r\nThe report is automatically directed to the IMC for subscriber line testing.\r\nWhen no line trouble is found, the IMC will refer the trouble condition\r\nto the SSC/MAC.

John Perry Barlow had a great deal of fun at its expense,\r\nin \"Crime and Puzzlement:\"  \"Bureaucrat-ese of surpassing opacity. . . .\r\nTo read the whole thing straight through without entering coma requires\r\neither a machine or a human who has too much practice thinking like one.\r\nAnyone who can understand it fully and fluidly had altered his consciousness\r\nbeyond the ability to ever again read Blake, Whitman, or Tolstoy. . . .\r\nthe document contains little of interest to anyone who is not a student\r\nof advanced organizational sclerosis.\"\r\n\r\nWith the Document itself to hand, however, exactly as it was published\r\n(in its six-page edited form) in Phrack, the reader may be able to verify\r\na few statements of fact about its nature.  First, there is no software,\r\nno computer code, in the Document.  It is not computer-programming language\r\nlike FORTRAN or C++, it is English; all the sentences have nouns and verbs\r\nand punctuation.  It does not explain how to break into the E911 system.\r\nIt does not suggest ways to destroy or damage the E911 system.\r\n\r\nThere are no access codes in the Document.  There are no computer passwords.\r\nIt does not explain how to steal long distance service.  It does not explain\r\nhow to break in to telco switching stations.  There is nothing in it about\r\nusing a personal computer or a modem for any purpose at all, good or bad.\r\n\r\nClose study will reveal that this document is not about machinery.\r\nThe E911 Document is about ADMINISTRATION. It describes how one creates\r\nand administers certain units of telco bureaucracy:\r\nSpecial Service Centers and Major Account Centers (SSC/MAC).\r\nIt describes how these centers should distribute responsibility\r\nfor the E911 service, to other units of telco bureaucracy,\r\nin a chain of command, a formal hierarchy.  It describes\r\nwho answers customer complaints, who screens calls,\r\nwho reports equipment failures, who answers those reports,\r\nwho handles maintenance, who chairs subcommittees,\r\nwho gives orders, who follows orders, WHO tells WHOM what to do.\r\nThe Document is not a \"roadmap\" to computers.\r\nThe Document is a roadmap to PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nAs an aid to breaking into computer systems, the Document is USELESS.\r\nAs an aid to harassing and deceiving telco people, however, the Document\r\nmight prove handy (especially with its Glossary, which I have not included).\r\nAn intense and protracted study of this Document and its Glossary,\r\ncombined with many other such documents, might teach one to speak like\r\na telco employee.  And telco people live by SPEECH--they live by phone\r\ncommunication.  If you can mimic their language over the phone,\r\nyou can \"social-engineer\" them.  If you can con telco people, you can\r\nwreak havoc among them.  You can force them to no longer trust one another;\r\nyou can break the telephonic ties that bind their community; you can make\r\nthem paranoid.  And people will fight harder to defend their community\r\nthan they will fight to defend their individual selves.\r\n\r\nThis was the genuine, gut-level threat posed by Phrack magazine.\r\nThe real struggle was over the control of telco language,\r\nthe control of telco knowledge.  It was a struggle to defend the social\r\n\"membrane of differentiation\" that forms the walls of the telco\r\ncommunity's ivory tower --the special jargon that allows telco\r\nprofessionals to recognize one another, and to exclude charlatans,\r\nthieves, and upstarts.  And the prosecution brought out this fact.\r\nThey repeatedly made reference to the threat posed to telco professionals\r\nby hackers using \"social engineering.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, Craig Neidorf was not on trial for learning to speak like\r\na professional telecommunications expert.  Craig Neidorf was on trial\r\nfor access device fraud and transportation of stolen property.\r\nHe was on trial for stealing a document that was purportedly\r\nhighly sensitive and purportedly worth tens of thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nJohn Nagle read the E911 Document.  He drew his own conclusions.\r\nAnd he presented Zenner and his defense team with an overflowing box\r\nof similar material, drawn mostly from Stanford University's\r\nengineering libraries.  During the trial, the defense team--Zenner,\r\nhalf-a-dozen other attorneys, Nagle, Neidorf, and computer-security\r\nexpert Dorothy Denning, all pored over the E911 Document line-by-line.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of July 25, 1990, Zenner began to cross-examine\r\na woman named Billie Williams, a service manager for Southern Bell\r\nin Atlanta.  Ms. Williams had been responsible for the E911 Document.\r\n(She was not its author--its original \"author\" was a Southern Bell\r\nstaff manager named Richard Helms.  However, Mr. Helms should not bear\r\nthe entire blame; many telco staff people and maintenance personnel\r\nhad amended the Document.  It had not been so much \"written\" by a\r\nsingle author, as built by committee out of concrete-blocks of jargon.)\r\n\r\nMs. Williams had been called as a witness for the prosecution,\r\nand had gamely tried to explain the basic technical structure\r\nof the E911 system, aided by charts.\r\n\r\nNow it was Zenner's turn.  He first established that the\r\n\"proprietary stamp\" that BellSouth had used on the E911 Document\r\nwas stamped on EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT that BellSouth wrote--\r\nTHOUSANDS of documents.  \"We do not publish anything other\r\nthan for our own company,\" Ms. Williams explained.\r\n\"Any company document of this nature is considered proprietary.\"\r\nNobody was in charge of singling out special high-security publications\r\nfor special high-security protection.  They were ALL special,\r\nno matter how trivial, no matter what their subject matter--\r\nthe stamp was put on as soon as any document was written,\r\nand the stamp was never removed.\r\n\r\nZenner now asked whether the charts she had been using to explain\r\nthe mechanics of E911 system were \"proprietary,\" too.\r\nWere they PUBLIC INFORMATION, these charts, all about PSAPs,\r\nALIs, nodes, local end switches?  Could he take the charts out\r\nin the street and show them to anybody, \"without violating\r\nsome proprietary notion that BellSouth has?\"\r\n\r\nMs Williams showed some confusion, but finally areed that the charts were,\r\nin fact, public.\r\n\r\n\"But isn't this what you said was basically what appeared in Phrack?\"\r\n\r\nMs. Williams denied this.\r\n\r\nZenner now pointed out that the E911 Document as published in Phrack\r\nwas only half the size of the original E911 Document (as Prophet\r\nhad purloined it).  Half of it had been deleted--edited by Neidorf.\r\n\r\nMs. Williams countered that \"Most of the information that is\r\nin the text file is redundant.\"\r\n\r\nZenner continued to probe.  Exactly what bits of knowledge in the Document\r\nwere, in fact, unknown to the public?  Locations of E911 computers?\r\nPhone numbers for telco personnel?  Ongoing maintenance subcommittees?\r\nHadn't Neidorf removed much of this?\r\n\r\nThen he pounced.  \"Are you familiar with Bellcore Technical Reference\r\nDocument TR-TSY-000350?\"  It was, Zenner explained, officially titled\r\n\"E911 Public Safety Answering Point Interface Between 1-1AESS Switch\r\nand Customer Premises Equipment.\"  It contained highly detailed\r\nand specific technical information about the E911 System.\r\nIt was published by Bellcore and publicly available for about $20.\r\n\r\nHe showed the witness a Bellcore catalog which listed thousands\r\nof documents from Bellcore and from all the Baby Bells, BellSouth included.\r\nThe catalog, Zenner pointed out, was free.  Anyone with a credit card\r\ncould call the Bellcore toll-free 800 number and simply order any\r\nof these documents, which would be shipped to any customer without question.\r\nIncluding, for instance, \"BellSouth E911 Service Interfaces to\r\nCustomer Premises Equipment at a Public Safety Answering Point.\"\r\n\r\nZenner gave the witness a copy of \"BellSouth E911 Service Interfaces,\"\r\nwhich cost, as he pointed out, $13, straight from the catalog.\r\n\"Look at it carefully,\" he urged Ms. Williams, \"and tell me\r\nif it doesn't contain about twice as much detailed information\r\nabout the E911 system of BellSouth than appeared anywhere in Phrack.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want me to. . . .\"  Ms. Williams trailed off.  \"I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a careful look,\" Zenner persisted.  \"Take a look at that document,\r\nand tell me when you're done looking at it if, indeed, it doesn't contain\r\nmuch more detailed information about the E911 system than appeared in Phrack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Phrack wasn't taken from this,\" Ms. Williams said.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me?\" said Zenner.\r\n\r\n\"Phrack wasn't taken from this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't hear you,\" Zenner said.\r\n\r\n\"Phrack was not taken from this document.  I don't understand\r\nyour question to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you don't,\" Zenner said.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the prosecution's case had been gutshot.\r\nMs. Williams was distressed.  Her confusion was quite genuine.\r\nPhrack had not been taken from any publicly available Bellcore document.\r\nPhrack's E911 Document had been stolen from her own company's computers,\r\nfrom her own company's text files, that her own colleagues had written,\r\nand revised, with much labor.\r\n\r\nBut the \"value\" of the Document had been blown to smithereens.\r\nIt wasn't worth eighty grand.  According to Bellcore it was worth\r\nthirteen bucks.  And the looming menace that it supposedly posed\r\nhad been reduced in instants to a scarecrow.  Bellcore itself\r\nwas selling material far more detailed and \"dangerous,\"\r\nto anybody with a credit card and a phone.\r\n\r\nActually, Bellcore was not giving this information to just anybody.\r\nThey gave it to ANYBODY WHO ASKED, but not many did ask.\r\nNot many people knew that Bellcore had a free catalog and an 800 number.\r\nJohn Nagle knew, but certainly the average teenage phreak didn't know.\r\n\"Tuc,\" a friend of Neidorf's and sometime Phrack contributor, knew,\r\nand Tuc had been very helpful to the defense, behind the scenes.\r\nBut the Legion of Doom didn't know--otherwise, they would never\r\nhave wasted so much time raiding dumpsters.  Cook didn't know.\r\nFoley didn't know.  Kluepfel didn't know.  The right hand\r\nof Bellcore knew not what the left hand was doing.  The right\r\nhand was battering hackers without mercy, while the left hand\r\nwas distributing Bellcore's intellectual property to anybody\r\nwho was interested in telephone technical trivia--apparently,\r\na pathetic few.\r\n\r\nThe digital underground was so amateurish and poorly organized\r\nthat they had never discovered this heap of unguarded riches.\r\nThe ivory tower of the telcos was so wrapped-up in the fog\r\nof its own technical obscurity that it had left all the\r\nwindows open and flung open the doors. No one had even noticed.\r\n\r\nZenner sank another nail in the coffin.  He produced a printed issue\r\nof Telephone Engineer & Management, a prominent industry journal\r\nthat comes out twice a month and costs $27 a year.  This particular issue\r\nof TE&M, called \"Update on 911,\" featured a galaxy of technical details\r\non 911 service and a glossary far more extensive than Phrack's.\r\n\r\nThe trial rumbled on, somehow, through its own momentum.\r\nTim Foley testified about his interrogations of Neidorf.\r\nNeidorf's written admission that he had known the E911 Document\r\nwas pilfered was officially read into the court record.\r\n\r\nAn interesting side issue came up:  \"Terminus\" had once passed Neidorf\r\na piece of UNIX AT&T software, a log-in sequence, that had been cunningly\r\naltered so that it could trap passwords.  The UNIX software itself was\r\nillegally copied AT&T property, and the alterations \"Terminus\" had made to it,\r\nhad transformed it into a device for facilitating computer break-ins.  Terminus\r\nhimself would eventually plead guilty to theft of this piece of software,\r\nand the Chicago group would send Terminus to prison for it.  But it was\r\nof dubious relevance in the Neidorf case.  Neidorf hadn't written the program.\r\nHe wasn't accused of ever having used it.  And Neidorf wasn't being charged\r\nwith software theft or owning a password trapper.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, Zenner took the offensive.  The civil libertarians\r\nnow had their own arcane, untried legal weaponry to launch into action--\r\nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 US Code,\r\nSection 2701 et seq.  Section 2701 makes it a crime to intentionally\r\naccess without authorization a facility in which an electronic communication\r\nservice is provided--it is, at heart, an anti-bugging and anti-tapping law,\r\nintended to carry the traditional protections of telephones into other\r\nelectronic channels of communication.  While providing penalties for amateur\r\nsnoops, however, Section 2703 of the ECPA also lays some formal difficulties\r\non the bugging and tapping activities of police.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service, in the person of Tim Foley, had served Richard Andrews\r\nwith a federal grand jury subpoena, in their pursuit of Prophet,\r\nthe E911 Document, and the Terminus software ring.  But according to\r\nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act, a \"provider of remote\r\ncomputing service\" was legally entitled to \"prior notice\" from\r\nthe government if a subpoena was used.  Richard Andrews and his\r\nbasement UNIX node, Jolnet, had not received any \"prior notice.\"\r\nTim Foley had purportedly violated the ECPA and committed\r\nan electronic crime!  Zenner now sought the judge's permission\r\nto cross-examine Foley on the topic of Foley's own electronic misdeeds.\r\n\r\nCook argued that Richard Andrews' Jolnet was a privately owned\r\nbulletin board, and not within the purview of ECPA.  Judge Bua\r\ngranted the motion of the government to prevent cross-examination\r\non that point, and Zenner's offensive fizzled.  This, however,\r\nwas the first direct assault on the legality of the actions\r\nof the Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force itself--\r\nthe first suggestion that they themselves had broken the law,\r\nand might, perhaps, be called to account.\r\n\r\nZenner, in any case, did not really need the ECPA.\r\nInstead, he grilled Foley on the glaring contradictions in\r\nthe supposed value of the E911 Document.  He also brought up\r\nthe embarrassing fact that the supposedly red-hot E911 Document\r\nhad been sitting around for months, in Jolnet, with Kluepfel's knowledge,\r\nwhile Kluepfel had done nothing about it.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, the Prophet was brought in to testify\r\nfor the prosecution.  (The Prophet, it will be recalled,\r\nhad also been indicted in the case as partner in a fraud\r\nscheme with Neidorf.)  In Atlanta, the Prophet had already\r\npled guilty to one charge of conspiracy, one charge of wire fraud\r\nand one charge of interstate transportation of stolen property.\r\nThe wire fraud charge, and the stolen property charge,\r\nwere both directly based on the E911 Document.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-year-old Prophet proved a sorry customer,\r\nanswering questions politely but in a barely audible mumble,\r\nhis voice trailing off at the ends of sentences.\r\nHe was constantly urged to speak up.\r\n\r\nCook, examining Prophet, forced him to admit that\r\nhe had once had a \"drug problem,\" abusing amphetamines,\r\nmarijuana, cocaine, and LSD.  This may have established\r\nto the jury that \"hackers\" are, or can be, seedy lowlife characters,\r\nbut it may have damaged Prophet's credibility somewhat.\r\nZenner later suggested that drugs might have damaged Prophet's memory.\r\nThe interesting fact also surfaced that Prophet had never\r\nphysically met Craig Neidorf.  He didn't even know\r\nNeidorf's last name--at least, not until the trial.\r\n\r\nProphet confirmed the basic facts of his hacker career.\r\nHe was a member of the Legion of Doom.  He had abused codes,\r\nhe had broken into switching stations and re-routed calls,\r\nhe had hung out on pirate bulletin boards.  He had raided\r\nthe BellSouth AIMSX computer, copied the E911 Document,\r\nstored it on Jolnet, mailed it to Neidorf.  He and Neidorf\r\nhad edited it, and Neidorf had known where it came from.\r\n\r\nZenner, however, had Prophet confirm that Neidorf was not a member\r\nof the Legion of Doom, and had not urged Prophet to break into\r\nBellSouth computers.  Neidorf had never urged Prophet to defraud anyone,\r\nor to steal anything.  Prophet also admitted that he had never known Neidorf\r\nto break in to any computer.  Prophet said that no one in the Legion of Doom\r\nconsidered Craig Neidorf a \"hacker\" at all.  Neidorf was not a UNIX maven,\r\nand simply lacked the necessary skill and ability to break into computers.\r\nNeidorf just published a magazine.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, July 27, 1990, the case against Neidorf collapsed.\r\nCook moved to dismiss the indictment, citing \"information currently\r\navailable to us that was not available to us at the inception of the trial.\"\r\nJudge Bua praised the prosecution for this action, which he described as\r\n\"very responsible,\" then dismissed a juror and declared a mistrial.\r\n\r\nNeidorf was a free man.  His defense, however, had cost himself\r\nand his family dearly.  Months of his life had been consumed in anguish;\r\nhe had seen his closest friends shun him as a federal criminal.\r\nHe owed his lawyers over a hundred thousand dollars, despite\r\na generous payment to the defense by Mitch Kapor.\r\n\r\nNeidorf was not found innocent.  The trial was simply dropped.\r\nNevertheless, on September 9, 1991, Judge Bua granted Neidorf's\r\nmotion for the \"expungement and sealing\" of his indictment record.\r\nThe United States Secret Service was ordered to delete and destroy\r\nall fingerprints, photographs, and other records of arrest\r\nor processing relating to Neidorf's indictment, including\r\ntheir paper documents and their computer records.\r\n\r\nNeidorf went back to school, blazingly determined to become a lawyer.\r\nHaving seen the justice system at work, Neidorf lost much of his enthusiasm\r\nfor merely technical power.  At this writing, Craig Neidorf is working\r\nin Washington as a salaried researcher for the American Civil Liberties Union.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the Neidorf trial changed the EFF\r\nfrom voices-in-the-wilderness to the media darlings\r\nof the new frontier.\r\n\r\nLegally speaking, the Neidorf case was not a sweeping triumph\r\nfor anyone concerned.  No constitutional principles had been established.\r\nThe issues of \"freedom of the press\" for electronic publishers remained\r\nin legal limbo.  There were public misconceptions about the case.\r\nMany people thought Neidorf had been found innocent and relieved\r\nof all his legal debts by Kapor.  The truth was that the government\r\nhad simply dropped the case, and Neidorf's family had gone deeply\r\ninto hock to support him.\r\n\r\nBut the Neidorf case did provide a single, devastating, public sound-bite:\r\nTHE FEDS SAID IT WAS WORTH EIGHTY GRAND, AND IT WAS ONLY WORTH THIRTEEN BUCKS.\r\n\r\nThis is the Neidorf case's single most memorable element.  No serious report\r\nof the case missed this particular element.  Even cops could not read this\r\nwithout a wince and a shake of the head.  It left the public credibility\r\nof the crackdown agents in tatters.\r\n\r\nThe crackdown, in fact, continued, however.  Those two charges\r\nagainst Prophet, which had been based on the E911 Document,\r\nwere quietly forgotten at his sentencing--even though Prophet\r\nhad already pled guilty to them.  Georgia federal prosecutors\r\nstrongly argued for jail time for the Atlanta Three, insisting on\r\n\"the need to send a message to the community,\" \"the message that\r\nhackers around the country need to hear.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal in their sentencing memorandum\r\nabout the awful things that various other hackers had done\r\n(though the Atlanta Three themselves had not, in fact,\r\nactually committed these crimes).  There was also much\r\nspeculation about the awful things that the Atlanta Three\r\nMIGHT have done and WERE CAPABLE of doing (even though\r\nthey had not, in fact, actually done them).\r\nThe prosecution's argument carried the day.\r\nThe Atlanta Three were sent to prison:\r\nUrvile and Leftist both got 14 months each,\r\nwhile Prophet (a second offender) got 21 months.\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta Three were also assessed staggering fines as \"restitution\":\r\n$233,000 each.  BellSouth claimed that the defendants had \"stolen\"\r\n\"approximately $233,880 worth\" of \"proprietary computer access information\"--\r\nspecifically, $233,880 worth of computer passwords and connect addresses.\r\nBellSouth's astonishing claim of the extreme value of its own computer\r\npasswords and addresses was accepted at face value by the Georgia court.\r\nFurthermore (as if to emphasize its theoretical nature) this enormous sum\r\nwas not divvied up among the Atlanta Three, but each of them had to pay\r\nall of it.\r\n\r\nA striking aspect of the sentence was that the Atlanta Three were\r\nspecifically forbidden to use computers, except for work or under supervision.\r\nDepriving hackers of home computers and modems makes some sense if one\r\nconsiders hackers as \"computer addicts,\" but EFF, filing an amicus brief\r\nin the case, protested that this punishment was unconstitutional--\r\nit deprived the Atlanta Three of their rights of free association\r\nand free expression through electronic media.\r\n\r\nTerminus, the \"ultimate hacker,\" was finally sent to prison for a year\r\nthrough the dogged efforts of the Chicago Task Force.  His crime,\r\nto which he pled guilty, was the transfer of the UNIX password trapper,\r\nwhich was officially valued by AT&T at $77,000, a figure which aroused\r\nintense skepticism among those familiar with UNIX \"login.c\" programs.\r\n\r\nThe jailing of Terminus and the Atlanta Legionnaires of Doom, however,\r\ndid not cause the EFF any sense of embarrassment or defeat.\r\nOn the contrary, the civil libertarians were rapidly gathering strength.\r\n\r\nAn early and potent supporter was Senator Patrick Leahy,\r\nDemocrat from Vermont, who had been a Senate sponsor\r\nof the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.  Even before\r\nthe Neidorf trial, Leahy had spoken out in defense of hacker-power\r\nand freedom of the keyboard:  \"We cannot unduly inhibit the inquisitive\r\n13-year-old who, if left to experiment today, may tomorrow develop\r\nthe telecommunications or computer technology to lead the United States\r\ninto the 21st century.  He represents our future and our best hope\r\nto remain a technologically competitive nation.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a handsome statement, rendered perhaps rather more effective\r\nby the fact that the crackdown raiders DID NOT HAVE any Senators\r\nspeaking out for THEM.  On the contrary, their highly secretive\r\nactions and tactics, all \"sealed search warrants\" here and\r\n\"confidential ongoing investigations\" there, might have won\r\nthem a burst of glamorous publicity at first, but were crippling\r\nthem in the on-going propaganda war.  Gail Thackeray was reduced\r\nto unsupported bluster:  \"Some of these people who are loudest\r\non the bandwagon may just slink into the background,\"\r\nshe predicted in Newsweek--when all the facts came out,\r\nand the cops were vindicated.\r\n\r\nBut all the facts did not come out.  Those facts that did,\r\nwere not very flattering.  And the cops were not vindicated.\r\nAnd Gail Thackeray lost her job.  By the end of 1991,\r\nWilliam Cook had also left public employment.\r\n\r\n1990 had belonged to the crackdown, but by '91 its agents\r\nwere in severe disarray, and the libertarians were on a roll.\r\nPeople were flocking to the cause.\r\n\r\nA particularly interesting ally had been Mike Godwin of Austin, Texas.\r\nGodwin was an individual almost as difficult to describe as Barlow;\r\nhe had been editor of the student newspaper of the University of Texas,\r\nand a computer salesman, and a programmer, and in 1990 was back\r\nin law school, looking for a law degree.\r\n\r\nGodwin was also a bulletin board maven.  He was very well-known\r\nin the Austin board community under his handle \"Johnny Mnemonic,\"\r\nwhich he adopted from a cyberpunk science fiction story by William Gibson.\r\nGodwin was an ardent cyberpunk science fiction fan.  As a fellow Austinite\r\nof similar age and similar interests, I myself had known Godwin socially\r\nfor many years.  When William Gibson and myself had been writing our\r\ncollaborative SF novel, The Difference Engine, Godwin had been our\r\ntechnical advisor in our effort to link our Apple word-processors\r\nfrom Austin to Vancouver.  Gibson and I were so pleased by his generous\r\nexpert help that we named a character in the novel \"Michael Godwin\"\r\nin his honor.\r\n\r\nThe handle \"Mnemonic\" suited Godwin very well.  His erudition\r\nand his mastery of trivia were impressive to the point of stupor;\r\nhis ardent curiosity seemed insatiable, and his desire to debate\r\nand argue seemed the central drive of his life.  Godwin had even\r\nstarted his own Austin debating society, wryly known as the\r\n\"Dull Men's Club.\"  In person, Godwin could be overwhelming;\r\na flypaper-brained polymath  who could not seem to let any idea go.\r\nOn bulletin boards, however, Godwin's closely reasoned,\r\nhighly grammatical, erudite posts suited the medium well,\r\nand he became a local board celebrity.\r\n\r\nMike Godwin was the man most responsible for the public national exposure\r\nof the Steve Jackson case.  The Izenberg seizure in Austin had received\r\nno press coverage at all.  The March 1 raids on Mentor, Bloodaxe, and\r\nSteve Jackson Games had received a brief front-page splash in the\r\nfront page of the Austin American-Statesman, but it was confused\r\nand ill-informed:  the warrants were sealed, and the Secret Service\r\nwasn't talking.  Steve Jackson seemed doomed to obscurity.\r\nJackson had not been arrested; he was not charged with any crime;\r\nhe was not on trial.  He had lost some computers in an ongoing\r\ninvestigation--so what?  Jackson tried hard to attract attention\r\nto the true extent of his plight, but he was drawing a blank;\r\nno one in a position to help him seemed able to get a mental grip\r\non the issues.\r\n\r\nGodwin, however, was uniquely, almost magically, qualified\r\nto carry Jackson's case to the outside world. Godwin was\r\na board enthusiast, a science fiction fan, a former journalist,\r\na computer salesman, a lawyer-to-be, and an Austinite.\r\nThrough a coincidence yet more amazing, in his last year\r\nof law school Godwin had specialized in federal prosecutions\r\nand criminal procedure.  Acting entirely on his own, Godwin made\r\nup a press packet which summarized the issues and provided useful\r\ncontacts for reporters.  Godwin's behind-the-scenes effort\r\n(which he carried out mostly to prove a point in a local board debate)\r\nbroke the story again in the Austin American-Statesman and then in Newsweek.\r\n\r\nLife was never the same for Mike Godwin after that.  As he joined the growing\r\ncivil liberties debate on the Internet, it was obvious to all parties involved\r\nthat here was one guy who, in the midst of complete murk and confusion,\r\nGENUINELY UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.  The disparate elements\r\nof Godwin's dilettantish existence suddenly fell together as neatly as\r\nthe facets of a Rubik's cube.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came to hire a full-time EFF staff attorney,\r\nGodwin was the obvious choice.  He took the Texas bar exam,\r\nleft Austin, moved to Cambridge, became a full-time, professional,\r\ncomputer civil libertarian, and was soon touring the nation on behalf\r\nof EFF, delivering well-received addresses on the issues to crowds\r\nas disparate as academics, industrialists, science fiction fans,\r\nand federal cops.\r\n\r\nMichael Godwin is currently the chief legal counsel of\r\nthe Electronic Frontier Foundation in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nAnother early and influential participant in the controversy\r\nwas Dorothy Denning.  Dr. Denning was unique among investigators\r\nof the computer underground in that she did not enter the debate\r\nwith any set of politicized motives.  She was a professional\r\ncryptographer and computer security expert whose primary interest\r\nin hackers was SCHOLARLY.  She had a B.A. and M.A. in mathematics,\r\nand a Ph.D. in computer science from Purdue.  She had worked for SRI\r\nInternational, the California think-tank that was also the home of\r\ncomputer-security maven Donn Parker, and had authored an influential text\r\ncalled Cryptography and Data Security.  In 1990, Dr. Denning was working for\r\nDigital Equipment Corporation in their Systems Reseach Center.  Her husband,\r\nPeter Denning, was also a computer security expert, working for NASA's\r\nResearch Institute for Advanced Computer Science.  He had edited the\r\nwell-received Computers Under Attack:  Intruders, Worms and Viruses.\r\n\r\nDr. Denning took it upon herself to contact the digital underground,\r\nmore or less with an anthropological interest.  There she discovered\r\nthat these computer-intruding hackers, who had been characterized\r\nas unethical, irresponsible, and a serious danger to society,\r\ndid in fact have their own subculture and their own rules.\r\nThey were not particularly well-considered rules, but they were,\r\nin fact, rules.  Basically, they didn't take money and they\r\ndidn't break anything.\r\n\r\nHer dispassionate reports on her researches did a great deal\r\nto influence serious-minded computer professionals--the sort\r\nof people who merely rolled their eyes at the cyberspace\r\nrhapsodies of a John Perry Barlow.\r\n\r\nFor young hackers of the digital underground, meeting Dorothy Denning\r\nwas a genuinely mind-boggling experience.  Here was this neatly coiffed,\r\nconservatively dressed, dainty little personage, who reminded most\r\nhackers of their moms or their aunts.  And yet she was an IBM systems\r\nprogrammer with profound expertise in computer architectures\r\nand high-security information flow, who had personal friends\r\nin the FBI and the National Security Agency.\r\n\r\nDorothy Denning was a shining example of the American mathematical\r\nintelligentsia, a genuinely brilliant person from the central ranks\r\nof the computer-science elite.  And here she was, gently questioning\r\ntwenty-year-old hairy-eyed phone-phreaks over the deeper ethical\r\nimplications of their behavior.\r\n\r\nConfronted by this genuinely nice lady, most hackers sat up very straight\r\nand did their best to keep the anarchy-file stuff down to a faint whiff\r\nof brimstone.  Nevertheless, the hackers WERE in fact prepared to seriously\r\ndiscuss serious issues with Dorothy Denning.  They were willing to speak\r\nthe unspeakable and defend the indefensible, to blurt out their convictions\r\nthat information cannot be owned, that the databases of governments and large\r\ncorporations were a threat to the rights and privacy of individuals.\r\n\r\nDenning's articles made it clear to many that \"hacking\"\r\nwas not simple vandalism by some evil clique of psychotics.\r\n\"Hacking\" was not an aberrant menace that could be charmed away\r\nby ignoring it, or swept out of existence by jailing a few ringleaders.\r\nInstead, \"hacking\" was symptomatic of a growing, primal struggle over\r\nknowledge and power in the age of information.\r\n\r\nDenning pointed out that the attitude of hackers were at least partially\r\nshared by forward-looking management theorists in the business community:\r\npeople like Peter Drucker and Tom Peters.  Peter Drucker, in his book\r\nThe New Realities, had stated that \"control of information by the government\r\nis no longer possible. Indeed, information is now transnational.\r\nLike money, it has no `fatherland.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd management maven Tom Peters had chided large corporations for uptight,\r\nproprietary attitudes in his bestseller, Thriving on Chaos:\r\n\"Information hoarding, especially by politically motivated,\r\npower-seeking staffs, had been commonplace throughout American industry,\r\nservice and manufacturing alike. It will be an impossible\r\nmillstone aroung the neck of tomorrow's organizations.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy Denning had shattered the social membrane of the\r\ndigital underground.  She attended the Neidorf trial,\r\nwhere she was prepared to testify for the defense as an expert witness.\r\nShe was a behind-the-scenes organizer of two of the most important\r\nnational meetings of the computer civil libertarians.  Though not\r\na zealot of any description, she brought disparate elements of the\r\nelectronic community into a surprising and fruitful collusion.\r\n\r\nDorothy Denning is currently the Chair of the Computer Science Department\r\nat Georgetown University in Washington, DC.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThere were many stellar figures in the civil libertarian community.\r\nThere's no question, however, that its single most influential figure\r\nwas Mitchell D. Kapor.  Other people might have formal titles,\r\nor governmental positions, have more experience with crime,\r\nor with the law, or with the arcanities of computer security\r\nor constitutional theory.  But by 1991 Kapor had transcended\r\nany such narrow role.  Kapor had become \"Mitch.\"\r\n\r\nMitch had become the central civil-libertarian ad-hocrat.\r\nMitch had stood up first, he had spoken out loudly, directly,\r\nvigorously and angrily, he had put his own reputation,\r\nand his very considerable personal fortune, on the line.\r\nBy mid-'91 Kapor was the best-known advocate of his cause\r\nand was known PERSONALLY by almost every single human being in America\r\nwith any direct influence on the question of civil liberties in cyberspace.\r\nMitch had built bridges, crossed voids, changed paradigms, forged metaphors,\r\nmade phone-calls and swapped business cards to such spectacular effect\r\nthat it had become impossible for anyone to take any action in the\r\n\"hacker question\" without wondering what Mitch might think--\r\nand say--and tell his friends.\r\n\r\nThe EFF had simply NETWORKED the situation into an entirely new status quo.\r\nAnd in fact this had been EFF's deliberate strategy from the beginning.\r\nBoth Barlow and Kapor loathed bureaucracies and had deliberately\r\nchosen to work almost entirely through the electronic spiderweb of\r\n\"valuable personal contacts.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a year of EFF, both Barlow and Kapor had every reason\r\nto look back with satisfaction.  EFF had established its own Internet node,\r\n\"eff.org,\" with a well-stocked electronic archive of documents on\r\nelectronic civil rights, privacy issues, and academic freedom.\r\nEFF was also publishing EFFector, a quarterly printed journal,\r\nas well as EFFector Online, an electronic newsletter with\r\nover 1,200 subscribers.  And EFF was thriving on the Well.\r\n\r\nEFF had a national headquarters in Cambridge and a full-time staff.\r\nIt had become a membership organization and was attracting\r\ngrass-roots support.  It had also attracted the support\r\nof some thirty civil-rights lawyers, ready and eager\r\nto do pro bono work in defense of the Constitution in Cyberspace.\r\n\r\nEFF had lobbied successfully in Washington and in Massachusetts\r\nto change state and federal legislation on computer networking.\r\nKapor in particular had become a veteran expert witness,\r\nand had joined the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board\r\nof the National Academy of Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nEFF had sponsored meetings such as \"Computers, Freedom and Privacy\"\r\nand the CPSR Roundtable.  It had carried out a press offensive that,\r\nin the words of EFFector, \"has affected the climate of opinion about\r\ncomputer networking and begun to reverse the slide into\r\n`hacker hysteria' that was beginning to grip the nation.\"\r\n\r\nIt had helped Craig Neidorf avoid prison.\r\n\r\nAnd, last but certainly not least, the Electronic Frontier Foundation\r\nhad filed a federal lawsuit in the name of Steve Jackson,\r\nSteve Jackson Games Inc., and three users of the Illuminati\r\nbulletin board system.  The defendants were, and are,\r\nthe United States Secret Service, William Cook, Tim Foley,\r\nBarbara Golden and Henry Kleupfel.\r\n\r\nThe case, which is in pre-trial procedures in an Austin federal court\r\nas of this writing, is a civil action for damages to redress\r\nalleged violations of the First and Fourth Amendments to the\r\nUnited States Constitution, as well as the Privacy Protection Act\r\nof 1980 (42 USC 2000aa et seq.), and the Electronic Communications\r\nPrivacy Act (18 USC 2510 et seq and 2701 et seq).\r\n\r\nEFF had established that it had credibility.  It had also established\r\nthat it had teeth.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1991 I travelled to Massachusetts to speak personally\r\nwith Mitch Kapor.  It was my final interview for this book.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe city of Boston has always been one of the major intellectual centers\r\nof the American republic.  It is a very old city by American standards,\r\na place of skyscrapers overshadowing seventeenth-century graveyards,\r\nwhere the high-tech start-up companies of Route 128 co-exist with the\r\nhand-wrought pre-industrial grace of \"Old Ironsides,\" the USS CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Bunker Hill, one of the first and bitterest armed clashes\r\nof the American Revolution, was fought in Boston's environs.  Today there is\r\na monumental spire on Bunker Hill, visible throughout much of the city.\r\nThe willingness of the republican revolutionaries to take up arms and fire\r\non their oppressors has left a  cultural legacy that two full centuries\r\nhave not effaced.  Bunker Hill is still a potent center of American political\r\nsymbolism, and the Spirit of '76  is still a potent image for those who seek\r\nto mold public opinion.\r\n\r\nOf course, not everyone who wraps himself in the flag is necessarily\r\na patriot.  When I visited the spire in September 1991, it bore a huge,\r\nbadly-erased, spray-can grafitto around its bottom reading\r\n\"BRITS OUT--IRA PROVOS.\"  Inside this hallowed edifice was\r\na glass-cased diorama of thousands of tiny toy soldiers,\r\nrebels and redcoats, fighting and dying over the green hill,\r\nthe riverside marshes, the rebel trenchworks.  Plaques indicated the\r\nmovement of troops, the shiftings of strategy.  The Bunker Hill Monument\r\nis occupied at its very center by the toy soldiers of a military\r\nwar-game simulation.\r\n\r\nThe Boston metroplex is a place of great universities,\r\nprominent among the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\r\nwhere the term \"computer hacker\" was first coined.  The Hacker Crackdown\r\nof 1990 might be interpreted as a political struggle among American cities:\r\ntraditional strongholds of longhair intellectual liberalism,\r\nsuch as Boston, San Francisco, and Austin, versus the bare-knuckle\r\nindustrial pragmatism of Chicago and Phoenix (with Atlanta and New York\r\nwrapped in internal struggle).\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the Electronic Frontier Foundation is on\r\n155 Second Street in Cambridge, a Bostonian suburb north\r\nof the River Charles.  Second Street has weedy sidewalks of dented,\r\nsagging brick and elderly cracked asphalt; large street-signs warn\r\n\"NO PARKING DURING DECLARED SNOW EMERGENCY.\"  This is an old area\r\nof modest manufacturing industries; the EFF is catecorner from the\r\nGreene Rubber Company.  EFF's building is two stories of red brick;\r\nits large wooden windows feature gracefully arched tops and stone sills.\r\n\r\nThe glass window beside the Second Street entrance bears three sheets\r\nof neatly laser-printed paper, taped against the glass.  They read:\r\nON Technology.  EFF.  KEI.\r\n\r\n\"ON Technology\" is Kapor's software company, which currently specializes\r\nin \"groupware\" for the Apple Macintosh computer.  \"Groupware\" is intended\r\nto promote efficient social interaction among office-workers linked\r\nby computers.  ON Technology's most successful software products to date\r\nare \"Meeting Maker\" and \"Instant Update.\"\r\n\r\n\"KEI\" is Kapor Enterprises Inc., Kapor's personal holding company,\r\nthe commercial entity that formally controls his extensive investments\r\nin other hardware and software corporations.\r\n\r\n\"EFF\" is a political action group--of a special sort.\r\n\r\nInside, someone's bike has been chained to the handrails\r\nof a modest flight of stairs.  A wall of modish glass brick\r\nseparates this anteroom from the offices.  Beyond the brick,\r\nthere's an alarm system mounted on the wall, a sleek, complex little\r\nnumber that resembles a cross between a thermostat and a CD player.\r\nPiled against the wall are box after box of a recent special issue\r\nof Scientific American, \"How to Work, Play, and Thrive in Cyberspace,\"\r\nwith extensive coverage of electronic networking techniques\r\nand political issues, including an article by Kapor himself.\r\nThese boxes are addressed to Gerard Van der Leun, EFF's\r\nDirector of Communications, who will shortly mail those magazines\r\nto every member of the EFF.\r\n\r\nThe joint headquarters of EFF, KEI, and ON Technology,\r\nwhich Kapor currently rents, is a modestly bustling place.\r\nIt's very much the same physical size as Steve Jackson's gaming company.\r\nIt's certainly a far cry from the gigantic gray steel-sided railway\r\nshipping barn, on the Monsignor O'Brien Highway, that is owned\r\nby Lotus Development Corporation.\r\n\r\nLotus is, of course, the software giant that Mitchell Kapor founded\r\nin the late 70s.  The software program Kapor co-authored,\r\n\"Lotus 1-2-3,\" is still that company's most profitable product.\r\n\"Lotus 1-2-3\" also bears a singular distinction in the\r\ndigital underground: it's probably the most pirated piece\r\nof application software in world history.\r\n\r\nKapor greets me cordially in his own office, down a hall.\r\nKapor, whose name is pronounced KAY-por, is in his early forties,\r\nmarried and the father of two.  He has a round face, high forehead,\r\nstraight nose, a slightly tousled mop of black hair peppered with gray.\r\nHis large brown eyes are wideset, reflective, one might almost say soulful.\r\nHe disdains ties, and commonly wears Hawaiian shirts and tropical prints,\r\nnot so much garish as simply cheerful and just that little bit anomalous.\r\n\r\nThere is just the whiff of hacker brimstone about Mitch Kapor.\r\nHe may not have the hard-riding, hell-for-leather, guitar-strumming\r\ncharisma of his Wyoming colleague John Perry Barlow, but there's\r\nsomething about the guy that still stops one short.  He has the air\r\nof the Eastern city dude in the bowler hat, the dreamy,\r\nLongfellow-quoting poker shark who only HAPPENS to know\r\nthe exact mathematical odds against drawing to an inside straight.\r\nEven among his computer-community colleagues, who are hardly known\r\nfor mental sluggishness, Kapor strikes one forcefully as a very\r\nintelligent man.  He speaks rapidly, with vigorous gestures,\r\nhis Boston accent sometimes slipping to the sharp nasal tang\r\nof his youth in Long Island.\r\n\r\nKapor, whose Kapor Family Foundation does much of his philanthropic work,\r\nis a strong supporter of Boston's Computer Museum.  Kapor's interest\r\nin the history of his industry has brought him some remarkable curios,\r\nsuch as the \"byte\" just outside his office door.  This \"byte\"--\r\neight digital bits--has been salvaged from the wreck of an\r\nelectronic computer of the pre-transistor age.  It's a standing gunmetal\r\nrack about the size of a small toaster-oven:  with eight slots\r\nof hand-soldered breadboarding featuring thumb-sized vacuum tubes.\r\nIf it fell off a table it could easily break your foot,\r\nbut it was state-of-the-art computation in the 1940s.\r\n(It would take exactly 157,184 of these primordial toasters\r\nto hold the first part of this book.)\r\n\r\nThere's also a coiling, multicolored, scaly dragon that some\r\ninspired techno-punk artist has cobbled up entirely out of transistors,\r\ncapacitors, and brightly plastic-coated wiring.\r\n\r\nInside the office, Kapor excuses himself briefly to do a little\r\nmouse-whizzing housekeeping on his personal Macintosh IIfx.\r\nIf its giant screen were an open window, an agile person\r\ncould climb through it without much trouble at all.\r\nThere's a coffee-cup at Kapor's elbow, a memento of his\r\nrecent trip to Eastern Europe, which has a black-and-white\r\nstencilled photo and the legend CAPITALIST FOOLS TOUR.\r\nIt's Kapor, Barlow, and two California venture-capitalist luminaries\r\nof their acquaintance, four windblown, grinning Baby Boomer\r\ndudes in leather jackets, boots, denim, travel bags,\r\nstanding on airport tarmac somewhere behind the formerly Iron Curtain.\r\nThey look as if they're having the absolute time of their lives.\r\n\r\nKapor is in a reminiscent mood.  We talk a bit about his youth--\r\nhigh school days as a \"math nerd,\" Saturdays attending Columbia University's\r\nhigh-school science honors program, where he had his first experience\r\nprogramming computers.  IBM 1620s, in 1965 and '66.  \"I was very interested,\"\r\nsays Kapor, \"and then I went off to college and got distracted by drugs sex\r\nand rock and roll, like anybody with half a brain would have then!\"\r\nAfter college he was a progressive-rock DJ in Hartford, Connecticut,\r\nfor a couple of years.\r\n\r\nI ask him if he ever misses his rock and roll days--if he ever wished\r\nhe could go back to radio work.\r\n\r\nHe shakes his head flatly.  \"I stopped thinking about going back\r\nto be a DJ the day after Altamont.\"\r\n\r\nKapor moved to Boston in 1974 and got a job programming mainframes in COBOL.\r\nHe hated it.  He quit and became a teacher of transcendental meditation.\r\n(It was Kapor's long flirtation with Eastern mysticism that gave the\r\nworld \"Lotus.\")\r\n\r\nIn 1976 Kapor went to Switzerland, where the Transcendental Meditation\r\nmovement had rented a gigantic Victorian hotel in St-Moritz.  It was\r\nan all-male group--a hundred and twenty of them--determined upon\r\nEnlightenment or Bust.  Kapor had given the transcendant his best shot.\r\nHe was becoming disenchanted by \"the nuttiness in the organization.\"\r\n\"They were teaching people to levitate,\" he says, staring at the floor.\r\nHis voice drops an octave, becomes flat.  \"THEY DON'T LEVITATE.\"\r\n\r\nKapor chose Bust.  He went back to the States and acquired a degree\r\nin counselling psychology.  He worked a while in a hospital,\r\ncouldn't stand that either.  \"My rep was,\" he says  \"a very bright kid\r\nwith a lot of potential who hasn't found himself.  Almost thirty.\r\nSort of lost.\"\r\n\r\nKapor was unemployed when he bought his first personal computer--an Apple II.\r\nHe sold his stereo to raise cash and drove to New Hampshire to avoid the\r\nsales tax.\r\n\r\n\"The day after I purchased it,\" Kapor tells me, \"I was hanging out\r\nin a computer store and I saw another guy, a man in his forties,\r\nwell-dressed guy, and eavesdropped on his conversation with the salesman.\r\nHe didn't know anything about computers.  I'd had a year programming.\r\nAnd I could program in BASIC.  I'd taught myself.  So I went up to him,\r\nand I actually sold myself to him as a consultant.\"  He pauses.\r\n\"I don't know where I got the nerve to do this.  It was uncharacteristic.\r\nI just said, `I think I can help you, I've been listening,\r\nthis is what you need to do and I think I can do it for you.'\r\nAnd he took me on!  He was my first client!  I became a computer\r\nconsultant the first day after I bought the Apple II.\"\r\n\r\nKapor had found his true vocation.  He attracted more clients\r\nfor his consultant service, and started an Apple users' group.\r\n\r\nA friend of Kapor's, Eric Rosenfeld, a graduate student at MIT,\r\nhad a problem.  He was doing a thesis on an arcane form of\r\nfinancial statistics, but could not wedge himself into the crowded queue\r\nfor time on MIT's mainframes.  (One might note at this point that if\r\nMr. Rosenfeld had dishonestly broken into the MIT mainframes,\r\nKapor himself might have never invented Lotus 1-2-3 and\r\nthe PC business might have been set back for years!)\r\nEric Rosenfeld did have an Apple II, however,\r\nand he thought it might be possible to scale the problem down.\r\nKapor, as favor, wrote a program for him in BASIC that did the job.\r\n\r\nIt then occurred to the two of them, out of the blue,\r\nthat it might be possible to SELL this program.\r\nThey marketed it themselves, in plastic baggies,\r\nfor about a hundred bucks a pop, mail order.\r\n\"This was a total cottage industry by a marginal consultant,\"\r\nKapor says proudly.  \"That's how I got started, honest to God.\"\r\n\r\nRosenfeld, who later became a very prominent figure on Wall Street,\r\nurged Kapor to go to MIT's business school for an MBA.\r\nKapor did seven months there, but never got his MBA.\r\nHe picked up some useful tools--mainly a firm grasp\r\nof the principles of accounting--and, in his own words,\r\n\"learned to talk MBA.\"  Then he dropped out and went to Silicon Valley.\r\n\r\nThe inventors of VisiCalc, the Apple computer's premier business program,\r\nhad shown an interest in Mitch Kapor.  Kapor worked diligently for them\r\nfor six months, got tired of California, and went back to Boston\r\nwhere they had better bookstores.  The VisiCalc group had made\r\nthe critical error of bringing in \"professional management.\"\r\n\"That drove them into the ground,\" Kapor says.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, you don't hear a lot about VisiCalc these days,\" I muse.\r\n\r\nKapor looks surprised.  \"Well, Lotus. . . we BOUGHT it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.  You BOUGHT it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sort of like the Bell System buying Western Union?\"\r\n\r\nKapor grins.  \"Yep!  Yep!  Yeah, exactly!\"\r\n\r\nMitch Kapor was not in full command of the destiny of himself\r\nor his industry.  The hottest software commodities of the early 1980s\r\nwere COMPUTER GAMES--the Atari seemed destined to enter every teenage home\r\nin America.  Kapor got into business software simply because he didn't have\r\nany particular feeling for computer games.  But he was supremely fast\r\non his feet, open to new ideas and inclined to trust his instincts.\r\nAnd his instincts were good.  He chose good people to deal with--\r\ngifted programmer Jonathan Sachs (the co-author of Lotus 1-2-3).\r\nFinancial wizard Eric Rosenfeld, canny Wall Street analyst\r\nand venture capitalist Ben Rosen.  Kapor was the founder and CEO of Lotus,\r\none of the most spectacularly successful business ventures of the\r\nlater twentieth century.\r\n\r\nHe is now an extremely wealthy man.  I ask him if he actually\r\nknows how much money he has.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he says.  \"Within a percent or two.\"\r\n\r\nHow much does he actually have, then?\r\n\r\nHe shakes his head.  \"A lot.  A lot.  Not something I talk about.\r\nIssues of money and class are  things that cut pretty close to the bone.\"\r\n\r\nI don't pry.  It's beside the point.  One might presume, impolitely,\r\nthat Kapor has at least forty million--that's what he got the year\r\nhe left Lotus.  People who ought to know claim Kapor has about\r\na hundred and fifty million, give or take a market swing\r\nin his stock holdings. If Kapor had stuck with Lotus,\r\nas his colleague friend and rival Bill Gates has stuck\r\nwith his own software start-up, Microsoft, then Kapor\r\nwould likely have much the same fortune Gates has--\r\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of three billion,\r\ngive or take a few hundred million.  Mitch Kapor\r\nhas all the money he wants.  Money has lost whatever charm\r\nit ever held for him--probably not much in the first place.\r\nWhen Lotus became too uptight, too bureaucratic, too far\r\nfrom the true sources of his own satisfaction, Kapor walked.\r\nHe simply severed all connections with the company and went out the door.\r\nIt stunned everyone--except those who knew him best.\r\n\r\nKapor has not had to strain his resources to wreak a thorough\r\ntransformation in cyberspace politics.  In its first year,\r\nEFF's budget was about a quarter of a million dollars.\r\nKapor is running EFF out of his pocket change.\r\n\r\nKapor takes pains to tell me that he does not consider himself\r\na civil libertarian per se.  He has spent quite some time\r\nwith true-blue civil libertarians lately, and there's a\r\npolitical-correctness to them that bugs him.  They seem\r\nto him to spend entirely too much time in legal nitpicking\r\nand not enough vigorously exercising civil rights in the\r\neveryday real world.\r\n\r\nKapor is an entrepreneur.  Like all hackers, he prefers his involvements\r\ndirect, personal, and hands-on.  \"The fact that EFF has a node on the\r\nInternet is a great thing.  We're a publisher.  We're a distributor\r\nof information.\"  Among the items the eff.org Internet node carries\r\nis back issues of Phrack.  They had an internal debate about that in EFF,\r\nand finally decided to take the plunge.  They might carry other\r\ndigital underground publications--but if they do, he says,\r\n\"we'll certainly carry Donn Parker, and anything Gail Thackeray\r\nwants to put up.  We'll turn it into a public library, that has\r\nthe whole spectrum of use.  Evolve in the direction of people making up\r\ntheir own minds.\"  He grins.  \"We'll try to label all the editorials.\"\r\n\r\nKapor is determined to tackle the technicalities of the Internet\r\nin the service of the public interest.  \"The problem with being a node\r\non the Net today is that you've got to have a captive technical specialist.\r\nWe have Chris Davis around, for the care and feeding of the balky beast!\r\nWe couldn't do it ourselves!\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses.  \"So one direction in which technology has to evolve\r\nis much more standardized units, that a non-technical person\r\ncan feel comfortable with.  It's the same shift as from minicomputers to PCs.\r\nI can see a future in which any person can have a Node on the Net.\r\nAny person can be a publisher.  It's better than the media we now have.\r\nIt's possible.  We're working actively.\"\r\n\r\nKapor is in his element now, fluent, thoroughly in command in his material.\r\n\"You go tell a hardware Internet hacker that everyone should have a node\r\non the Net,\" he says, \"and the first thing they're going to say is,\r\n`IP doesn't scale!'\"  (\"IP\" is the interface protocol for the Internet.\r\nAs it currently exists, the IP software is simply not capable of\r\nindefinite expansion; it will run out of usable addresses, it will saturate.)\r\n\"The answer,\" Kapor says, \"is:  evolve the protocol!  Get the smart people\r\ntogether and figure out what to do.  Do we add ID?  Do we add new protocol?\r\nDon't just say, WE CAN'T DO IT.\"\r\n\r\nGetting smart people together to figure out what to do is a skill\r\nat which Kapor clearly excels.  I counter that people on the Internet\r\nrather enjoy their elite technical status, and don't seem particularly\r\nanxious to democratize the Net.\r\n\r\nKapor agrees, with a show of scorn.  \"I tell them that this is the snobbery\r\nof the people on the Mayflower looking down their noses at the people\r\nwho came over ON THE SECOND BOAT!  Just because they got here a year,\r\nor five years, or ten years before everybody else, that doesn't give\r\nthem ownership of cyberspace!  By what right?\"\r\n\r\nI remark that the telcos are an electronic network, too,\r\nand they seem to guard their specialized knowledge pretty closely.\r\n\r\nKapor ripostes that the telcos and the Internet are entirely\r\ndifferent animals.  \"The Internet is an open system,\r\neverything is published, everything gets argued about,\r\nbasically by anybody who can get in.  Mostly, it's exclusive\r\nand elitist just because it's so difficult.  Let's make it easier to use.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he allows with a swift change of emphasis,\r\nthe so-called elitists do have a point as well. \"Before people start coming in,\r\nwho are new, who want to make suggestions, and criticize the Net as\r\n`all screwed up'. . . .  They should at least take the time to understand\r\nthe culture on its own terms.  It has its own history--show some respect\r\nfor it.  I'm a conservative, to that extent.\"\r\n\r\nThe Internet is Kapor's paradigm for the future of telecommunications.\r\nThe Internet is decentralized, non-hierarchical, almost anarchic.\r\nThere are no bosses, no chain of command, no secret data.\r\nIf each node obeys the general interface standards,\r\nthere's simply no need for any central network authority.\r\n\r\nWouldn't that spell the doom of AT&T as an institution?  I ask.\r\n\r\nThat prospect doesn't faze Kapor for a moment.  \"Their  big advantage,\r\nthat they have now, is that they have all of the wiring.\r\nBut two things are happening.  Anyone with right-of-way\r\nis putting down fiber--Southern Pacific Railroad,\r\npeople like that--there's enormous `dark fiber' laid in.\"\r\n(\"Dark Fiber\" is fiber-optic cable, whose enormous capacity\r\nso exceeds the demands of current usage that much of the\r\nfiber still has no light-signals on it--it's still `dark,'\r\nawaiting future use.)\r\n\r\n\"The other thing that's happening is the local-loop stuff\r\nis going to go wireless.  Everyone from Bellcore to the cable TV\r\ncompanies to AT&T wants to put in these things called\r\n`personal communication systems.'  So you could have local competition--\r\nyou could have multiplicity of people, a bunch of neighborhoods,\r\nsticking stuff up on poles.  And a bunch of other people laying in dark fiber.\r\nSo what happens to the telephone companies?  There's enormous pressure\r\non them from both sides.\r\n\r\n\"The more I look at this, the more I believe that in a post-industrial,\r\ndigital world, the idea of regulated monopolies is bad.  People will\r\nlook back on it and say that in the 19th and 20th centuries\r\nthe idea of public utilities was an okay compromise.\r\nYou needed one set of wires in the ground.  It was too economically\r\ninefficient, otherwise.  And that meant one entity running it.\r\nBut now, with pieces being wireless--the connections are going\r\nto be via high-level interfaces, not via wires.  I mean, ULTIMATELY\r\nthere are going to be wires--but the wires are just a commodity.\r\nFiber, wireless.  You no longer NEED a utility.\"\r\n\r\nWater utilities?  Gas utilities?\r\n\r\nOf course we still need those, he agrees.  \"But when what you're moving\r\nis information, instead of physical substances, then you can play by\r\na different set of rules.  We're evolving those rules now!\r\nHopefully you can have a much more decentralized system,\r\nand one in which there's more competition in the marketplace.\r\n\r\n\"The role of government will be to make sure that nobody cheats.\r\nThe proverbial `level playing field.'  A policy that prevents monopolization.\r\nIt should result in better service, lower prices, more choices,\r\nand local empowerment.\"  He smiles.  \"I'm very big on local empowerment.\"\r\n\r\nKapor is a man with a vision.  It's a very novel vision which he\r\nand his allies are working out in considerable detail and with great energy.\r\nDark, cynical, morbid cyberpunk that I am, I cannot avoid considering\r\nsome of the darker implications of \"decentralized, nonhierarchical,\r\nlocally empowered\" networking.\r\n\r\nI remark that some pundits have suggested that electronic networking--faxes,\r\nphones, small-scale photocopiers--played a strong role in dissolving\r\nthe power of centralized communism and causing the collapse of the Warsaw Pact.\r\n\r\nSocialism is totally discredited, says Kapor, fresh back from\r\nthe Eastern Bloc.  The idea that faxes did it, all by themselves,\r\nis rather wishful thinking.\r\n\r\nHas it occurred to him that electronic networking might corrode\r\nAmerica's industrial and political infrastructure to the point\r\nwhere the whole thing becomes untenable, unworkable--and the old order\r\njust collapses headlong, like in Eastern Europe?\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Kapor says flatly.  \"I think that's extraordinarily unlikely.\r\nIn part, because ten or fifteen years ago, I had similar hopes\r\nabout personal computers--which utterly failed to materialize.\"\r\nHe grins wryly, then his eyes narrow. \"I'm VERY opposed to techno-utopias.\r\nEvery time I see one, I either run away, or try to kill it.\"\r\n\r\nIt dawns on me then that Mitch Kapor is not trying to\r\nmake the world safe for democracy.  He certainly is not\r\ntrying to make it safe for anarchists or utopians--\r\nleast of all for computer intruders or electronic rip-off artists.\r\nWhat he really hopes to do is make the world safe for\r\nfuture Mitch Kapors.  This world of decentralized, small-scale nodes,\r\nwith instant global access for the best and brightest,\r\nwould be a perfect milieu for the shoestring attic capitalism\r\nthat made Mitch Kapor what he is today.\r\n\r\nKapor is a very bright man.  He has a rare combination\r\nof visionary intensity with a strong practical streak.\r\nThe Board of the EFF:  John Barlow, Jerry Berman of the ACLU,\r\nStewart Brand, John Gilmore, Steve Wozniak, and Esther Dyson,\r\nthe doyenne of East-West computer entrepreneurism--share his gift,\r\nhis vision, and his formidable networking talents.\r\nThey are people of the 1960s, winnowed-out by its turbulence\r\nand rewarded with wealth and influence.  They are some of the best\r\nand the brightest that the electronic community has to offer.\r\nBut can they do it, in the real world?  Or are they only dreaming?\r\nThey are so few.  And there is so much against them.\r\n\r\nI leave Kapor and his networking employees struggling cheerfully\r\nwith the promising intricacies of their newly installed Macintosh\r\nSystem 7 software.  The next day is Saturday.  EFF is closed.\r\nI pay a few visits to points of interest downtown.\r\n\r\nOne of them is the birthplace of the telephone.\r\n\r\nIt's marked by a bronze plaque in a plinth of black-and-white speckled granite.  It sits in the\r\nplaza of the John F. Kennedy Federal Building, the very place where Kapor was\r\nonce fingerprinted by the FBI.\r\n\r\nThe plaque has a bas-relief picture of Bell's original telephone.\r\n\"BIRTHPLACE OF THE TELEPHONE,\" it reads.  \"Here, on June 2, 1875,\r\nAlexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson first transmitted sound over wires.\r\n\r\n\"This successful experiment was completed in a fifth floor garret\r\nat what was then 109 Court Street and marked the beginning of\r\nworld-wide telephone service.\"\r\n\r\n109 Court Street is long gone.  Within sight of Bell's plaque,\r\nacross a street, is one of the central offices of NYNEX,\r\nthe local  Bell RBOC, on 6 Bowdoin Square.\r\n\r\nI cross the street and circle the telco building, slowly,\r\nhands in my jacket pockets.  It's a bright, windy, New England\r\nautumn day.  The central office is a handsome 1940s-era megalith\r\nin late Art Deco, eight stories high.\r\n\r\nParked outside the back is a power-generation truck.\r\nThe generator strikes me as rather anomalous.  Don't they\r\nalready have their own generators in this eight-story monster?\r\nThen the suspicion strikes me that NYNEX must have heard\r\nof the September 17 AT&T power-outage which crashed New York City.\r\nBelt-and-suspenders, this generator.  Very telco.\r\n\r\nOver the glass doors of the front entrance is a handsome bronze\r\nbas-relief of Art Deco vines, sunflowers, and birds, entwining\r\nthe Bell logo and the legend NEW ENGLAND TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH COMPANY\r\n--an entity which no longer officially exists.\r\n\r\nThe doors are locked securely.  I peer through the shadowed glass.\r\nInside is an official poster reading:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"New England Telephone a NYNEX Company\r\n\r\nATTENTION\r\n\r\n\"All persons while on New England Telephone\r\nCompany premises are required to visibly wear their\r\nidentification cards (C.C.P. Section 2, Page 1).\r\n\r\n\"Visitors, vendors, contractors, and all others are\r\nrequired to visibly wear a daily pass.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\r\n\r\nKevin C. Stanton.\r\nBuilding Security Coordinator.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside, around the corner, is a pull-down ribbed metal security door,\r\na locked delivery entrance.  Some passing stranger has grafitti-tagged\r\nthis door, with a single word in red spray-painted cursive:\r\n\r\nFury\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nMy book on the Hacker Crackdown is almost over now.\r\nI have deliberately saved the best for last.\r\n\r\nIn February 1991, I attended the CPSR Public Policy Roundtable,\r\nin Washington, DC.  CPSR, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,\r\nwas a sister organization of EFF, or perhaps its aunt, being older\r\nand perhaps somewhat wiser in the ways of the world of politics.\r\n\r\nComputer Professionals for  Social Responsibility began in 1981\r\nin Palo Alto, as an informal discussion group of Californian\r\ncomputer scientists and technicians, united by nothing more\r\nthan an electronic mailing list.  This typical high-tech\r\nad-hocracy received the dignity of its own acronym in 1982,\r\nand was formally incorporated in 1983.\r\n\r\nCPSR lobbied government and public alike with an educational\r\noutreach effort, sternly warning against any foolish\r\nand unthinking trust in complex computer systems.\r\nCPSR insisted that mere computers should never be\r\nconsidered a magic panacea for humanity's social,\r\nethical or political problems.  CPSR members were especially\r\ntroubled about the stability, safety, and dependability\r\nof military computer systems, and very especially troubled\r\nby those systems controlling nuclear arsenals.  CPSR was\r\nbest-known for its persistent and well-publicized attacks on the\r\nscientific credibility of the Strategic Defense Initiative (\"Star Wars\").\r\n\r\nIn 1990, CPSR was the nation's veteran cyber-political activist group,\r\nwith over two thousand members in twenty- one local chapters across the US.\r\nIt was especially active in Boston, Silicon Valley, and Washington DC,\r\nwhere its Washington office sponsored the Public Policy Roundtable.\r\n\r\nThe Roundtable, however, had been funded by EFF, which had passed CPSR\r\nan extensive grant for operations. This was the first large-scale,\r\nofficial meeting of what was to become the electronic civil\r\nlibertarian community.\r\n\r\nSixty people attended, myself included--in this instance, not so much\r\nas a journalist as a cyberpunk author.  Many of the luminaries\r\nof the field took part: Kapor and Godwin as a matter of course.\r\nRichard Civille and Marc Rotenberg of CPSR.  Jerry Berman of the ACLU.\r\nJohn Quarterman, author of The Matrix. Steven Levy, author of Hackers.\r\nGeorge Perry and Sandy Weiss of Prodigy Services, there to network\r\nabout the civil-liberties troubles their young commercial\r\nnetwork was experiencing.  Dr. Dorothy Denning.  Cliff Figallo,\r\nmanager of the Well.  Steve Jackson was there, having finally\r\nfound his ideal target audience, and so was Craig Neidorf,\r\n\"Knight Lightning\" himself, with his attorney, Sheldon Zenner.\r\nKatie Hafner, science journalist, and co-author of Cyberpunk:\r\nOutlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier. Dave Farber,\r\nARPAnet pioneer and fabled Internet guru.  Janlori Goldman\r\nof the ACLU's Project on Privacy and Technology.  John Nagle\r\nof Autodesk and the Well.  Don Goldberg of the House Judiciary Committee.\r\nTom Guidoboni, the defense attorney in the Internet Worm case.\r\nLance Hoffman, computer-science professor at The George Washington\r\nUniversity.  Eli Noam of Columbia.  And a host of others no less distinguished.\r\n\r\nSenator Patrick Leahy delivered the keynote address,\r\nexpressing his determination to keep ahead of the curve\r\non the issue of electronic free speech.  The address was\r\nwell-received, and the sense of excitement was palpable.\r\nEvery panel discussion was interesting--some were entirely\r\ncompelling.  People networked with an almost frantic interest.\r\n\r\nI myself had a most interesting and cordial lunch discussion with\r\nNoel and Jeanne Gayler, Admiral Gayler being a former director\r\nof the National Security Agency.  As this was the first known encounter\r\nbetween an actual no-kidding cyberpunk and a chief executive of\r\nAmerica's largest and best-financed electronic espionage apparat,\r\nthere was naturally a bit of eyebrow-raising on both sides.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our discussion was off-the-record.  In fact\r\nall  the discussions at the CPSR were officially off-the-record,\r\nthe idea being to do some serious networking in an atmosphere\r\nof complete frankness, rather than to stage a media circus.\r\n\r\nIn any case, CPSR Roundtable, though interesting and intensely valuable,\r\nwas as nothing compared to the truly mind-boggling event that transpired\r\na mere month later.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n\"Computers, Freedom and Privacy.\"  Four hundred people from\r\nevery conceivable corner of America's electronic community.\r\nAs a science fiction writer, I have been to some weird gigs in my day,\r\nbut this thing is truly BEYOND THE PALE.  Even \"Cyberthon,\"\r\nPoint Foundation's \"Woodstock of Cyberspace\" where Bay Area\r\npsychedelia collided headlong with the emergent world\r\nof computerized virtual reality, was like a Kiwanis Club gig\r\ncompared to this astonishing do.\r\n\r\nThe \"electronic community\" had reached an apogee.\r\nAlmost every principal in this book is in attendance.\r\nCivil Libertarians.  Computer Cops.  The Digital Underground.\r\nEven a few discreet telco people.  Colorcoded dots\r\nfor lapel tags are distributed.  Free Expression issues.\r\nLaw Enforcement.  Computer Security.  Privacy.  Journalists.\r\nLawyers.  Educators.  Librarians.  Programmers.\r\nStylish punk-black dots for the hackers and phone phreaks.\r\nAlmost everyone here seems to wear eight or nine dots,\r\nto have six or seven professional hats.\r\n\r\nIt is a community.  Something like Lebanon perhaps,\r\nbut a digital nation. People who had feuded all year\r\nin the national press, people who entertained the deepest\r\nsuspicions of one another's motives and ethics, are now\r\nin each others' laps.  \"Computers, Freedom and Privacy\"\r\nhad every reason in the world to turn ugly, and yet except\r\nfor small irruptions of puzzling nonsense from the\r\nconvention's token lunatic, a surprising bonhomie reigned.\r\nCFP was like a wedding-party in which two lovers,\r\nunstable bride and charlatan groom, tie the knot\r\nin a clearly disastrous matrimony.\r\n\r\nIt is clear to both families--even to neighbors and random guests--\r\nthat this is not a workable relationship, and yet the young couple's\r\ndesperate attraction can brook no further delay.  They simply cannot\r\nhelp themselves.  Crockery will fly, shrieks from their newlywed home\r\nwill wake the city block, divorce waits in the wings like a vulture\r\nover the Kalahari, and yet this is a wedding, and there is going\r\nto be a child from it.  Tragedies end in death; comedies in marriage.\r\nThe Hacker Crackdown is ending in marriage.  And there will be a child.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, anomalies reign.  John Perry Barlow,\r\ncyberspace ranger, is here.  His color photo in\r\nThe New York Times Magazine, Barlow scowling\r\nin a grim Wyoming snowscape, with long black coat,\r\ndark hat, a Macintosh SE30 propped on a fencepost\r\nand an awesome frontier rifle tucked under one arm,\r\nwill be the single most striking visual image\r\nof the Hacker Crackdown.  And he is CFP's guest of honor--\r\nalong with Gail Thackeray of the FCIC!  What on earth do\r\nthey expect these dual guests to do with each other?  Waltz?\r\n\r\nBarlow delivers the first address.  Uncharacteristically,\r\nhe is hoarse--the sheer volume of roadwork has worn him down.\r\nHe speaks briefly, congenially, in a plea for conciliation,\r\nand takes his leave to a storm of applause.\r\n\r\nThen Gail Thackeray takes the stage.  She's visibly nervous.\r\nShe's been on the Well a lot lately.  Reading those Barlow posts.\r\nFollowing Barlow is a challenge to anyone.  In honor of the famous\r\nlyricist for the Grateful Dead, she announces reedily, she is going to read--\r\nA POEM.  A poem she has composed herself.\r\n\r\nIt's an awful poem, doggerel in the rollicking meter of Robert W. Service's\r\nThe Cremation of Sam McGee, but it is in fact, a poem.  It's the Ballad\r\nof the Electronic Frontier!  A poem about the Hacker Crackdown and the\r\nsheer unlikelihood of CFP.  It's full of in-jokes.  The score or so cops\r\nin the audience, who are sitting together in a nervous claque,\r\nare absolutely cracking-up.  Gail's poem is the funniest goddamn thing\r\nthey've ever heard.  The hackers and civil-libs, who had this woman figured\r\nfor Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS, are staring with their jaws hanging loosely.\r\nNever in the wildest reaches of their imagination had they figured\r\nGail Thackeray was capable of such a totally off-the-wall move.\r\nYou can see them punching their mental CONTROL-RESET buttons.\r\nJesus!  This woman's a hacker weirdo!  She's JUST LIKE US!\r\nGod, this changes everything!\r\n\r\nAl Bayse, computer technician for the FBI, had been the only cop\r\nat the CPSR Roundtable, dragged there with his arm bent by\r\nDorothy Denning.  He was guarded and tightlipped at CPSR Roundtable;\r\na \"lion thrown to the Christians.\"\r\n\r\nAt CFP, backed by a claque of cops, Bayse suddenly waxes eloquent\r\nand even droll, describing the FBI's \"NCIC 2000\", a gigantic digital catalog\r\nof criminal records, as if he has suddenly become some weird hybrid\r\nof George Orwell and George Gobel.  Tentatively, he makes an arcane\r\njoke about statistical analysis.  At least a third of the crowd laughs aloud.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't laugh at that at my last speech,\" Bayse observes.\r\nHe had been addressing cops--STRAIGHT cops, not computer people.\r\nIt had been a worthy meeting, useful one supposes, but nothing like THIS.\r\nThere has never been ANYTHING like this.  Without any prodding,\r\nwithout any preparation, people in the audience simply begin to ask questions.\r\nLonghairs, freaky people, mathematicians.  Bayse is answering, politely,\r\nfrankly, fully, like a man walking on air.  The ballroom's atmosphere\r\ncrackles with surreality.  A female lawyer behind me breaks into a sweat\r\nand a hot waft of surprisingly potent and musky perfume flows off\r\nher pulse-points.\r\n\r\nPeople are giddy with laughter.  People are interested,\r\nfascinated, their eyes so wide and dark that they seem eroticized.\r\nUnlikely daisy-chains form in the halls, around the bar, on the escalators:\r\ncops with hackers, civil rights with FBI, Secret Service with phone phreaks.\r\n\r\nGail Thackeray is at her crispest in a white wool sweater with a\r\ntiny Secret Service logo.  \"I found Phiber Optik at the payphones,\r\nand when he saw my sweater, he turned into a PILLAR OF SALT!\" she chortles.\r\n\r\nPhiber discusses his case at much length with his arresting officer,\r\nDon Delaney of the New York State Police.  After an hour's chat,\r\nthe two of them look ready to begin singing \"Auld Lang Syne.\"\r\nPhiber finally finds the courage to get his worst complaint off his chest.\r\nIt isn't so much the arrest.  It was the CHARGE.  Pirating service\r\noff 900 numbers.  I'm a PROGRAMMER, Phiber insists.  This lame charge\r\nis going to hurt my reputation.  It would have been cool to be busted\r\nfor something happening, like Section 1030 computer intrusion.\r\nMaybe some kind of crime that's scarcely been invented yet.\r\nNot lousy phone fraud.  Phooey.\r\n\r\nDelaney seems regretful.  He had a mountain of possible criminal charges\r\nagainst Phiber Optik.  The kid's gonna plead guilty anyway.  He's a\r\nfirst timer, they always plead.  Coulda charged the kid with most anything,\r\nand gotten the same result in the end.  Delaney seems genuinely sorry\r\nnot to have gratified Phiber in this harmless fashion.  Too late now.\r\nPhiber's pled already.  All water under the bridge.  Whaddya gonna do?\r\n\r\nDelaney's got a good grasp on the hacker mentality.\r\nHe held a press conference after he busted a bunch of\r\nMasters of Deception kids.  Some journo had asked him:\r\n\"Would you describe these people as GENIUSES?\"\r\nDelaney's deadpan answer, perfect:  \"No, I would describe\r\nthese people as DEFENDANTS.\"  Delaney busts a kid for\r\nhacking codes with repeated random dialling.  Tells the\r\npress that NYNEX can track this stuff in no time flat nowadays,\r\nand a kid has to be STUPID to do something so easy to catch.\r\nDead on again:  hackers don't mind being thought of as Genghis Khan\r\nby the straights, but if there's anything that really gets 'em\r\nwhere they live, it's being called DUMB.\r\n\r\nWon't be as much fun for Phiber next time around.\r\nAs a second offender he's gonna see prison.\r\nHackers break the law.  They're not geniuses, either.\r\nThey're gonna be defendants.  And yet, Delaney muses over\r\na drink in the hotel bar, he has found it impossible to treat\r\nthem as common criminals.  Delaney knows criminals.  These kids,\r\nby comparison, are clueless--there is just no crook vibe off of them,\r\nthey don't smell right, they're just not BAD.\r\n\r\nDelaney has seen a lot of action.  He did Vietnam.\r\nHe's been shot at, he has shot people.  He's a homicide\r\ncop from New York.  He has the appearance of a man who\r\nhas not only seen the shit hit the fan but has seen it splattered\r\nacross whole city blocks and left to ferment for years.\r\nThis guy has been around.\r\n\r\nHe listens to Steve Jackson tell his story.  The dreamy\r\ngame strategist has been dealt a bad hand.  He has played\r\nit for all he is worth.  Under his nerdish SF-fan exterior\r\nis a core of iron.  Friends of his say Steve Jackson believes\r\nin the rules, believes in fair play.  He will never compromise\r\nhis principles, never give up.  \"Steve,\" Delaney says to\r\nSteve Jackson, \"they had some balls, whoever busted you.\r\nYou're all right!\"  Jackson, stunned, falls silent and\r\nactually blushes with pleasure.\r\n\r\nNeidorf has grown up a lot in the past year.  The kid is\r\na quick study, you gotta give him that.  Dressed by his mom,\r\nthe fashion manager for a national clothing chain,\r\nMissouri college techie-frat Craig Neidorf out-dappers\r\neveryone at this gig but the toniest East Coast lawyers.\r\nThe iron jaws of prison clanged shut without him and now\r\nlaw school beckons for Neidorf.  He looks like a larval Congressman.\r\n\r\nNot a \"hacker,\" our Mr. Neidorf.  He's not interested\r\nin computer science.  Why should he be?  He's not\r\ninterested in writing C code the rest of his life,\r\nand besides, he's seen where the chips fall.\r\nTo the world of computer science he and Phrack\r\nwere just a curiosity.  But to the world of law. . . .\r\nThe kid has learned where the bodies are buried.\r\nHe carries his notebook of press clippings wherever he goes.\r\n\r\nPhiber Optik makes fun of Neidorf for a Midwestern geek,\r\nfor believing that \"Acid Phreak\" does acid and listens to acid rock.\r\nHell no.  Acid's never done ACID!  Acid's into ACID HOUSE MUSIC.\r\nJesus.  The very idea of doing LSD.  Our PARENTS did LSD, ya clown.\r\n\r\nThackeray suddenly turns upon Craig Neidorf the full lighthouse\r\nglare of her attention and begins a determined half-hour attempt\r\nto WIN THE BOY OVER.  The Joan of Arc of Computer Crime is\r\nGIVING CAREER ADVICE TO KNIGHT LIGHTNING!  \"Your experience\r\nwould be very valuable--a real asset,\" she tells him with\r\nunmistakeable sixty-thousand-watt sincerity.  Neidorf is fascinated.\r\nHe listens with unfeigned attention.  He's nodding and saying yes ma'am.\r\nYes, Craig, you too can forget all about money and enter the glamorous\r\nand horribly underpaid world of PROSECUTING COMPUTER CRIME!\r\nYou can put your former friends in prison--ooops. . . .\r\n\r\nYou cannot go on dueling at modem's length indefinitely.\r\nYou cannot beat one another senseless with rolled-up press-clippings.\r\nSooner or later you have to come directly to grips.\r\nAnd yet the very act of assembling here has changed\r\nthe entire situation drastically.  John Quarterman,\r\nauthor of The Matrix, explains the Internet at his symposium.\r\nIt is the largest news network in the world, it is growing\r\nby leaps and bounds, and yet you cannot measure Internet because\r\nyou cannot stop it in place.  It cannot stop, because there\r\nis no one anywhere in the world with the authority to stop Internet.\r\nIt changes, yes, it grows, it embeds itself across the post-industrial,\r\npostmodern world and it generates community wherever it\r\ntouches, and it is doing this all by itself.\r\n\r\nPhiber is different.  A very fin de siecle kid, Phiber Optik.\r\nBarlow says he looks like an Edwardian dandy.  He does rather.\r\nShaven neck, the sides of his skull cropped hip-hop close,\r\nunruly tangle of black hair on top that looks pomaded,\r\nhe stays up till four a.m.  and misses all the sessions,\r\nthen hangs out in payphone booths with his acoustic coupler\r\ngutsily CRACKING SYSTEMS RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE HEAVIEST\r\nLAW ENFORCEMENT DUDES IN THE U.S., or at least PRETENDING to. . . .\r\nUnlike \"Frank Drake.\"  Drake, who wrote Dorothy Denning out\r\nof nowhere, and asked for an interview for his cheapo\r\ncyberpunk fanzine, and then started grilling her on her ethics.\r\nShe was squirmin', too. . . .  Drake, scarecrow-tall with his\r\nfloppy blond mohawk, rotting tennis shoes and black leather jacket\r\nlettered ILLUMINATI in red, gives off an unmistakeable air\r\nof the bohemian literatus.  Drake is the kind of guy\r\nwho reads British industrial design magazines and appreciates\r\nWilliam Gibson because the quality of the prose is so tasty.\r\nDrake could never touch a phone or a keyboard again,\r\nand he'd still have the nose-ring and the blurry photocopied\r\nfanzines and the sampled industrial music.  He's a radical punk\r\nwith a desktop-publishing rig and an Internet address.\r\nStanding next to Drake, the diminutive Phiber looks like he's\r\nbeen physically coagulated out of phone-lines.  Born to phreak.\r\n\r\nDorothy Denning approaches Phiber suddenly.  The two of them\r\nare about the same height and body-build.  Denning's blue eyes\r\nflash behind the round window-frames of her glasses.\r\n\"Why did you say I was `quaint?'\" she asks Phiber, quaintly.\r\n\r\nIt's a perfect description but Phiber is nonplussed. . .\r\n\"Well, I uh, you know. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"I also think you're quaint, Dorothy,\" I say, novelist to the rescue,\r\nthe journo gift of gab. . . .  She is neat and dapper and yet there's\r\nan arcane quality to her, something like a Pilgrim Maiden behind\r\nleaded glass; if she were six inches high Dorothy Denning would look\r\ngreat inside a china cabinet. . .The Cryptographeress. . .\r\nThe Cryptographrix. . .whatever. . . .  Weirdly, Peter Denning looks\r\njust like his wife, you could pick this gentleman out of a thousand guys\r\nas the soulmate of Dorothy Denning.  Wearing tailored slacks,\r\na spotless fuzzy varsity sweater, and a neatly knotted academician's tie. . . .\r\nThis fineboned, exquisitely polite, utterly civilized and hyperintelligent\r\ncouple seem to have emerged from some cleaner and finer parallel universe,\r\nwhere humanity exists to do the Brain Teasers column in Scientific American.\r\nWhy does this Nice Lady hang out with these unsavory characters?\r\n\r\nBecause the time has come for it, that's why.\r\nBecause she's the best there is at what she does.\r\n\r\nDonn Parker is here, the Great Bald Eagle of Computer Crime. . . .\r\nWith his bald dome, great height, and enormous Lincoln-like hands,\r\nthe great visionary pioneer of the field plows through the lesser mortals\r\nlike an icebreaker. . . .  His eyes are fixed on the future with the\r\nrigidity of a bronze statue. . . .  Eventually, he tells his audience,\r\nall business crime will be computer crime, because businesses will do\r\neverything through computers.  \"Computer crime\" as a category will vanish.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, passing fads will flourish and fail and evaporate. . . .\r\nParker's commanding, resonant voice is sphinxlike, everything is viewed\r\nfrom some eldritch valley of deep historical abstraction. . . .\r\nYes, they've come and they've gone, these passing flaps in the world\r\nof digital computation. . . .  The radio-frequency emanation scandal. . .\r\nKGB and MI5 and CIA do it every day, it's easy, but nobody else ever has. . . .\r\nThe salami-slice fraud, mostly mythical. . . .  \"Crimoids,\" he calls them. . . .\r\nComputer viruses are the current crimoid champ, a lot less dangerous than\r\nmost people let on, but the novelty is fading and there's a crimoid vacuum at\r\nthe moment, the press is visibly hungering for something more outrageous. . . .\r\nThe Great Man shares with us a few speculations on the coming crimoids. . . .\r\nDesktop Forgery!  Wow. . . .  Computers stolen just for the sake of the\r\ninformation within them--data-napping!  Happened in Britain a while ago,\r\ncould be the coming thing. . . .  Phantom nodes in the Internet!\r\n\r\nParker handles his overhead projector sheets with an ecclesiastical air. . . .\r\nHe wears a grey double-breasted suit, a light blue shirt, and a\r\nvery quiet tie of understated maroon and blue paisley. . . .\r\nAphorisms emerge from him with slow, leaden emphasis. . . .\r\nThere is no such thing as an adequately secure computer\r\nwhen one faces a sufficiently powerful adversary. . . .\r\nDeterrence is the most socially useful aspect of security. . . .\r\nPeople are the primary weakness in all information systems. . . .\r\nThe entire baseline of computer security must be shifted upward. . . .\r\nDon't ever violate your security by publicly describing\r\nyour security measures. . . .\r\n\r\nPeople in the audience are beginning to squirm, and yet\r\nthere is something about the elemental purity of this guy's\r\nphilosophy that compels uneasy respect. . . .  Parker sounds\r\nlike the only sane guy left in the lifeboat, sometimes.\r\nThe guy who can prove rigorously, from deep moral principles,\r\nthat Harvey there, the one with the broken leg and the checkered past,\r\nis the one who has to be, err. . .that is, Mr. Harvey is best placed\r\nto make the necessary sacrifice for the security and indeed\r\nthe very survival of the rest of this lifeboat's crew. . . .\r\nComputer security, Parker informs us mournfully, is a\r\nnasty topic, and we wish we didn't have to have  it. . . .\r\nThe security expert, armed with method and logic, must think--imagine--\r\neverything that the adversary might do before the adversary might\r\nactually do it.  It is as if the criminal's dark brain were an\r\nextensive subprogram within the shining cranium of Donn Parker.\r\nHe is a Holmes whose Moriarty does not quite yet exist\r\nand so must be perfectly simulated.\r\n\r\nCFP is a stellar gathering, with the giddiness of a wedding.\r\nIt is a happy time, a happy ending, they know their world\r\nis changing forever tonight, and they're proud to have been there\r\nto see it happen, to talk, to think, to help.\r\n\r\nAnd yet as night falls, a certain elegiac quality manifests itself,\r\nas the crowd gathers beneath the chandeliers with their wineglasses\r\nand dessert plates.  Something is ending here, gone forever,\r\nand it takes a while to pinpoint it.\r\n\r\nIt is the End of the Amateurs.",
