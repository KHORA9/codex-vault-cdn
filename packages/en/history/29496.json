They are the\r\nbrightest jewels in her crown. Columbus is a permanent orb in the\r\nprogress of civilization. From the highest rung of the ladder of fame,\r\nhe has stepped to the skies. America \"still hangs blossoming in the\r\ngarden of time, while her penetrating perfume floats all round the\r\nworld, and intoxicates all other nations with the hope of liberty.\" If\r\npossible, these tributes would add somewhat to the luster of fame which\r\nalready encircles the Nation and the Man. Many voices here speak for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSix hundred authors and more have written of Columbus or his great\r\ndiscovery. An endless task therefore would it be to attempt to\r\nenumerate, much less set out, the thousands who have incidentally, and\r\neven encomiastically, referred to him. Equally impossible would it be to\r\nhope to include a tithe of their utterances within the limits of any\r\nsingle volume, even were it of colossal proportions. This volume of\r\ntributes essays then to be but a concordance of some of the most choice\r\nand interesting extracts, and, artistically illustrated with statues,\r\nscenes, and inscriptions, is issued at an appropriate time and place.\r\nThe compiler desires in this preface to acknowledge his sincere\r\nobligations and indebtedness to the many authors and publishers who so\r\ncourteously and uniformly extended their consents to use copyright\r\nmatter, and to express an equal sense of gratitude to his friend, Stuart\r\nC. Wade, for his valuable assistance in selecting, arranging, and\r\nindexing much of the matter herein contained.\r\n\r\nIn one of the galleries of Florence there is a remarkable bust of\r\nBrutus, left unfinished by the great sculptor Michael Angelo. Some\r\nwriter explained the incomplete condition by indicating that the artist\r\nabandoned his labor in despair, \"overcome by the grandeur of the\r\nsubject.\" With similar feeling, this little book is submitted to the\r\nadmirers of Columbus and Columbia, wherever they may be found.\r\n\r\n                                                         J.

As to his birthplace there can be no legitimate doubt; he\r\nsays himself of Genoa, in his will, \"Della salí y en ella naci\" (from\r\nthere I came, and there was I born), though authorities, authors, and\r\neven poets differ. Some, like Tennyson, having\r\n\r\n  Stay'd the wheels at Cogoletto\r\n  And drank, and loyally drank, to him.\r\n\r\nHis father was a wool-comber, of some small means, who was living two\r\nyears after the discovery of the West Indies, and who removed his\r\nbusiness from Genoa to Savona in 1469. Christopher, the eldest son, was\r\nsent to the University of Pavia, where he devoted himself to the\r\nmathematical and natural sciences, and where he probably received\r\ninstruction in nautical astronomy from Antonio da Terzago and Stefano di\r\nFaenza. On his removal from the university it appears that he worked for\r\nsome months at his father's trade; but on reaching his fifteenth year he\r\nmade his choice of life, and became a sailor.\r\n\r\nOf his apprenticeship, and the first years of his career, no records\r\nexist. The whole of his earlier life, indeed, is dubious and\r\nconjectural, founded as it is on the half-dozen dark and evasive\r\nchapters devoted by Hernando, his son and biographer, to the first\r\nhalf-century of his father's times. It seems certain, however, that\r\nthese unknown years were stormy, laborious, and eventful; \"wherever ship\r\nhas sailed,\" he writes, \"there have I journeyed.\" He is known, among\r\nother places, to have visited England, \"Ultima Thule\" (Iceland), the\r\nGuinea Coast, and the Greek Isles; and he appears to have been some time\r\nin the service of René of Provence, for whom he is recorded to have\r\nintercepted and seized a Venetian galley with great bravery and\r\naudacity. According to his son, too, he sailed with Colombo el Mozo, a\r\nbold sea captain and privateer; and a sea fight under this commander was\r\nthe means of bringing him ashore in Portugal. Meanwhile, however, he was\r\npreparing himself for greater achievements by reading and meditating on\r\nthe works of Ptolemy and Marinus, of Nearchus and Pliny, the\r\nCosmographia of Cardinal Aliaco, the travels of Marco Polo and\r\nMandeville. He mastered all the sciences essential to his calling,\r\nlearned to draw charts and construct spheres, and thus fitted himself to\r\nbecome a consummate practical seaman and navigator.\r\n\r\nIn 1470 he arrived at Lisbon, after being wrecked in a sea fight that\r\nbegan off Cape St. Vincent, and escaping to land on a plank. In Portugal\r\nhe married Felipa Moñiz de Perestrello, daughter of Bartollomeu\r\nPerestrello, a captain in the service of Prince Henry, called the\r\nNavigator, one of the early colonists and the first governor of Porto\r\nSanto, an island off Madeira. Columbus visited the island, and employed\r\nhis time in making maps and charts for a livelihood, while he pored over\r\nthe logs and papers of his deceased father-in-law, and talked with old\r\nseamen of their voyages and of the mystery of the Western seas. About\r\nthis time, too, he seems to have arrived at the conclusion that much of\r\nthe world remained undiscovered, and step by step to have conceived\r\nthat design of reaching Asia by sailing west which was to result in the\r\ndiscovery of America. In 1474 we find him expounding his views to Paolo\r\nToscanelli, the Florentine physician and cosmographer, and receiving the\r\nheartiest encouragement.\r\n\r\nThese views he supported with three different arguments, derived from\r\nnatural reasons, from the theories of geographers, and from the reports\r\nand traditions of mariners. \"He believed the world to be a sphere,\" says\r\nHelps; \"he underestimated its size; he overestimated the size of the\r\nAsiatic continent. The farther that continent extended to the east, the\r\nnearer it came round toward Spain.\" And he had but to turn from the\r\nmarvelous propositions of Mandeville and Aliaco to become the recipient\r\nof confidences more marvelous still. The air was full of rumors, and the\r\nweird imaginings of many generations of mediæval navigators had taken\r\nshape and substance, and appeared bodily to men's eyes. Martin Vicente,\r\na Portuguese pilot, had found, 450 leagues to the westward of Cape St.\r\nVincent, and after a westerly gale of many days' duration, a piece of\r\nstrange wood, sculptured very artistically, but not with iron. Pedro\r\nCorrea, his own brother-in-law, had seen another such waif near the\r\nIsland of Madeira, while the King of Portugal had information of great\r\ncanes, capable of holding four quarts of wine between joint and joint,\r\nwhich Herrera declares the King received, preserved, and showed to\r\nColumbus. From the colonists on the Azores Columbus heard of two men\r\nbeing washed up at Flores, \"very broad-faced, and differing in aspect\r\nfrom Christians.\" The transport of all these objects being attributed to\r\nthe west winds and not to the gulf stream, the existence of which was\r\nthen totally unsuspected. West of the Azores now and then there hove in\r\nsight the mysterious Islands of St. Brandan; and 200 leagues west of the\r\nCanaries lay somewhere the lost Island of the Seven Cities, that two\r\nvaliant Genoese had vainly endeavored to discover, and in search of\r\nwhich, yearly, the merchants of Bristol sent expeditions, even before\r\nColumbus sailed. In his northern journey, too, some vague and formless\r\ntraditions may have reached his ear of the voyages of Biorn and Lief,\r\nand of the pleasant coasts of Helleland, Markland, and Vinland that lay\r\ntoward the setting sun. All were hints and rumors to bid the bold\r\nmariner sail westward, and this he at length determined to do. There is\r\nalso some vague and unreliable tradition as to a Portuguese pilot\r\ndiscovering the Indies previous to Columbus, and on his deathbed\r\nrevealing the secret to the Genoese explorer. It is at the best but a\r\nfanciful tale.\r\n\r\nThe concurrence of some state or sovereign, however, was necessary for\r\nthe success of this design. The Senate of Genoa had the honor to receive\r\nthe first offer, and the responsibility of refusing it. Rejected by his\r\nnative city, the projector turned next to John II. of Portugal. This\r\nKing had already an open field for discovery and enterprise along the\r\nAfrican coast; but he listened to the Genoese, and referred him to the\r\nCommittee of Council for Geographical Affairs. The council's report was\r\naltogether adverse; but the King, who was yet inclined to favor the\r\ntheory of Columbus, assented to the suggestion of the Bishop of Ceuta\r\nthat the plan should be carried out in secret, and without Columbus'\r\nknowledge, by means of a caravel or light frigate. The caravel was\r\ndispatched, but it returned after a brief absence, the sailors having\r\nlost heart, and having refused to venture farther. Upon discovering this\r\ndishonorable transaction, Columbus felt so outraged and indignant that\r\nhe sent off his brother Bartholomew to England with letters for Henry\r\nVII., to whom he had communicated his ideas. He himself left Lisbon\r\nmany other friends, and here met with Beatrix Enriquez, the mother of\r\nhis second son, Hernando, who was born August 15, 1488.\r\n\r\nA certain class of writers pretend that Beatrix Enriquez was the lawful\r\nwife of Columbus.[1] If so, when he died she would of right have been\r\nVice-Queen Dowager of the Indies. Is it likely that $56 would have been\r\nthe pension settled upon a lady of such rank? Señor Castelar, than whom\r\nthere is no greater living authority, scouts the idea of a legal\r\nmarriage; and, indeed, it is only a few irresponsible and peculiarly\r\naggressive Catholic writers who have the hardihood to advance this more\r\nthan improbable theory. Mr. Henry Harrisse, a most painstaking critic,\r\nthinks that Felipa Moñiz died in 1488. She was buried in the Monastery\r\ndo Carmo, at Lisbon, and some trace of her may hereafter be found in the\r\narchives of the Provedor or Registrar of Wills, at Lisbon, when these\r\npapers are arranged, as she must have bequeathed a sum to the poor,\r\nunder the customs then prevailing.\r\n\r\nFrom Cordova, Columbus followed the court to Salamanca, where he was\r\nintroduced to the notice of the grand cardinal, Pedro Gonzales de\r\nMendoza, \"the third King of Spain.\" The cardinal, while approving the\r\nproject, thought that it savored strongly of heterodoxy; but an\r\ninterview with the projector brought him over, and through his influence\r\nColumbus at last got audience of the King. The matter was finally\r\nreferred, however, to Fernando de Talavera, who, in 1487, summoned a\r\njunta of astronomers and cosmographers to confer with Columbus, and\r\nexamine his design and the arguments by which he supported it. The\r\nDominicans of San Estebàn in Salamanca entertained Columbus during the\r\nconference. The jurors, who were most of them ecclesiastics, were by no\r\nmeans unprejudiced, nor were they disposed to abandon their pretensions\r\nto for Spain (1484), taking with him his son Diego, the only issue of\r\nhis marriage with Felipa Moñiz. He departed secretly, according to some\r\nwriters to give the slip to King John, according to others to escape his\r\ncreditors. In one of his letters Columbus says: \"When I came from such a\r\ngreat distance to serve these princes, I abandoned a wife and children,\r\nwhom, for this cause, I never saw again.\" The first traces of Columbus\r\nat the court of Spain are on May 5, 1487, when an entry in some accounts\r\nreads: \"Given to-day 3,000 maravedis (about $18) to Cristobal Colomo, a\r\nstranger.\" Three years after (March 20, 1488), a letter was sent by the\r\nKing to \"Christopher Colon, our especial friend,\" inviting him to\r\nreturn, and assuring him against arrest and proceedings of any kind; but\r\nit was then too late.\r\n\r\nColumbus next betook himself to the south of Spain, and seems to have\r\nproposed his plan first to the Duke of Medina Sidonia (who was at first\r\nattracted by it, but finally threw it up as visionary and\r\nimpracticable), and next to the Duke of Medina Celi. The latter gave him\r\ngreat encouragement, entertained him for two years, and even determined\r\nto furnish him with the three or four caravels. Finally, however, being\r\ndeterred by the consideration that the enterprise was too vast for a\r\nsubject, he turned his guest from the determination he had come to, of\r\nmaking instant application to the court of France, by writing on his\r\nbehalf to Queen Isabella; and Columbus repaired to the court at Cordova\r\nat her bidding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS BEFORE THE DOMINICAN JUNTA AT\r\nSALAMANCA, SPAIN.\r\n\r\nFrom the celebrated painting by Señor V. Izquierdo.\r\n\r\n(See page 16.)]\r\n\r\nIt was an ill moment for the navigator's fortune. Castille and Leon were\r\nin the thick of that struggle which resulted in the final defeat of the\r\nMoors; and neither Ferdinand nor Isabella had time to listen. The\r\nadventurer was indeed kindly received; he was handed over to the care of\r\nAlonzo de Quintanilla, whom he speedily converted into an enthusiastic\r\nsupporter of his theory. He made knowledge without a struggle.\r\nColumbus argued his point, but was overwhelmed with Biblical texts, with\r\nquotations from the great divines, with theological objections, and in a\r\nshort time the junta was adjourned. Señor Rodriguez Pinilla, the learned\r\nSalamantine writer, holds that the first refusal of Columbus' project\r\nwas made in the official council at Cordova. In 1489, Columbus, who had\r\nbeen following the court from place to place (billeted in towns as an\r\nofficer of the King and gratified from time to time with sums of money\r\ntoward his expenses), was present at the siege of Malaga. In 1490 the\r\njunta decided that his project was vain and impracticable, and that it\r\ndid not become their Highnesses to have anything to do with it; and this\r\nwas confirmed, with some reservation, by their Highnesses themselves, at\r\nSeville.\r\n\r\nColumbus was now in despair. So reduced in circumstances was he that\r\n(according to the eminent Spanish statesman and orator, Emilio Castelar)\r\nhe was jocularly and universally termed \"the stranger with the\r\nthreadbare coat.\" He at once betook himself to Huelva, where his\r\nbrother-in-law resided, with the intention of taking ship to France. He\r\nhalted, however, at Palos, a little maritime town in Andalusia. At the\r\nMonastery of Santa Maria de la Rábida[2] he knocked and asked for bread\r\nand water for his boy Diego, and presently got into conversation with\r\nFray Juan Perez de Marchena, the prior, who invited him to take up his\r\nquarters in the monastery, and introduced him to Garci Fernandez, a\r\nphysician and an ardent student of geography. To these good men did\r\nColumbus propound his theory and explain his plan. Juan Perez had been\r\nthe Queen's confessor; he wrote to her and was summoned to her presence,\r\nand money was sent to Columbus to bring him once more to court. He\r\nreached Granada in time to witness the surrender of the city by the\r\nMoors, and negotiations were resumed. Columbus believed in his mission,\r\nand stood out for high terms; he asked the rank of admiral at once, the\r\nvice-royalty of all he should discover, and a tenth of all the gain, by\r\nconquest or by trade. These conditions were rejected, and the\r\nnegotiations were again interrupted. An interview with Mendoza appears\r\nto have followed, but nothing came of it, and in January, 1492, Columbus\r\nactually set out for France. At length, however, on the entreaty of Luis\r\nde Santangel, receiver of the ecclesiastical revenues of the crown of\r\nAragon, Isabella was induced to determine on the expedition. A messenger\r\nwas sent after Columbus, and overtook him at the Bridge of Piños, about\r\ntwo leagues from Granada. He returned to the camp at Santa Fé, and on\r\nApril 17, 1492, the agreement between him and their Catholic Majesties\r\nwas signed and sealed. This agreement being familiarly known in Spanish\r\nhistory as \"The Capitulations of Santa Fé.\"\r\n\r\nHis aims were nothing less than the discovery of the marvelous province\r\nof Cipango and the conversion to Christianity of the Grand Khan, to whom\r\nhe received a royal and curious blank letter of introduction. The town\r\nof Palos was, by forced levy, as a punishment for former rebellion,\r\nordered to find him three caravels, and these were soon placed at his\r\ndisposal. But no crews could be got together, Columbus even offering to\r\nthrow open the jails and take all criminals and broken men who would\r\nserve on the expedition; and had not Juan Perez succeeded in interesting\r\nMartin Alonzo Pinzon and Vicente Yañez Pinzon in the cause, Columbus'\r\ndeparture had been long delayed. At last, however, men, ships, and\r\nstores were ready. The expedition consisted of the Gallega, rechristened\r\nthe Santa Maria, a decked ship, with a crew of fifty men, commanded by\r\nthe Admiral in person; and of two caravels--the Pinta, with thirty men,\r\nunder Martin Pinzon, and the Niña, with twenty-four men, under his\r\nbrother, Vicente Yañez Pinzon, afterward (1499) the first to cross the\r\nline in the American Atlantic. The adventurers numbered 120 souls, and\r\non Friday, August 3, 1492, at 8 in the morning, the little fleet weighed\r\nanchor and stood out for the Canary Islands, sailing as it were \"into a\r\nworld unknown--the corner-stone of a nation.\"\r\n\r\nDeeply significant was one incident of their first few days' sail.\r\nEmilio Castelar tells us that these barks, laden with bright promises\r\nfor the future, were sighted by other ships, laden with the hatreds and\r\nrancors of the past, for it chanced that one of the last vessels\r\ntransporting into exile the Jews, expelled from Spain by the religious\r\nintolerance of which the recently created and odious Tribunal of the\r\nFaith was the embodiment, passed by the little fleet bound in search of\r\nanother world, where creation should be newborn, a haven be afforded\r\nto the quickening principle of human liberty, and a temple be reared to\r\nthe God of enfranchised and redeemed consciences.\r\n\r\nAn abstract of the Admiral's diary made by the Bishop Las Casas is yet\r\nextant; and from it many particulars may be gleaned concerning this\r\nfirst voyage. Three days after the ships had set sail the Pinta lost her\r\nrudder. The Admiral was in some alarm, but comforted himself with the\r\nreflection that Martin Pinzon was energetic and ready-witted; they had,\r\nhowever, to put in (August 9th) at Teneriffe to refit the caravel. On\r\nSeptember 6th they weighed anchor once more with all haste, Columbus\r\nhaving been informed that three Portuguese caravels were on the lookout\r\nfor him. On September 13th the variations of the magnetic needle were\r\nfor the first time observed;[3] and on the 15th a wonderful meteor fell\r\ninto the sea at four or five leagues distance. On the 16th they arrived\r\nat those vast plains of seaweed called the Sargasso Sea; and\r\nthenceforward, writes the Admiral, they had most temperate breezes, the\r\nsweetness of the mornings being most delightful, the weather like an\r\nAndalusian April, and only the song of the nightingale wanting. On the\r\n17th the men began to murmur. They were frightened by the strange\r\nphenomena of the variations of the compass, but the explanation Columbus\r\ngave restored their tranquillity. On the 18th they saw many birds and a\r\ngreat ridge of low-lying cloud, and they expected to see land. On the\r\n20th they saw two pelicans, and they were sure the land must be near. In\r\nthis, however, they were disappointed, and the men began to be afraid\r\nand discontented; and thenceforth Columbus, who was keeping all the\r\nwhile a double reckoning--one for the crew and one for himself--had\r\ngreat difficulty in restraining the men from the excesses which they\r\nmeditated. On the 25th Alonzo Pinzon raised the cry of land, but it\r\nproved a false alarm; as did the rumor to the same effect on October\r\n7th, when the Niña hoisted a flag and fired a gun. On the 11th the Pinta\r\nfished up a cane, a log of wood, a stick wrought with iron, and a board,\r\nand the Niña sighted a branch of hawthorne laden with ripe luscious\r\nberries, \"and with these signs all of them breathed and were glad.\" At\r\n8 o'clock on that night, Columbus perceived and pointed out a light\r\nahead,[4] Pedro Gutierrez also seeing it; and at 2 in the morning of\r\nFriday, October 12, 1492, Rodrigo de Triana, a sailor aboard the Niña, a\r\nnative of Seville, announced the appearance of what proved to be the New\r\nWorld.[5] The land sighted was an island called by the Indians\r\nGuanahani, and named by Columbus San Salvador.[6]\r\n\r\nThe same morning Columbus landed, richly clad, and bearing the royal\r\nbanner of Spain. He was accompanied by the brothers Pinzon, bearing\r\nbanners of the Green Cross, a device of his own, and by great part of\r\nthe crew. When they had all \"given thanks to God, kneeling down upon the\r\nshore, and kissed the ground with tears of joy, for the great mercy\r\nreceived,\" the Admiral named the island, and took solemn possession of\r\nit for their Catholic Majesties of Castille and Leon. At the same time\r\nsuch of the crews as had shown themselves doubtful and mutinous sought\r\nhis pardon weeping, and prostrated themselves at his feet. Had Columbus\r\nkept the course he laid on leaving Ferrol, says Castelar, his landfall\r\nwould have been in the Florida of to-day, that is, upon the main\r\ncontinent; but, owing to the deflection suggested by the Pinzons, and\r\ntardily accepted by him, it was his hap to strike an island, very fair\r\nto look upon, but small and insignificant when compared with the vast\r\nisland-world in whose waters he was already sailing.\r\n\r\nInto the details of this voyage, of highest interest as it is, it is\r\nimpossible to go further. The letter of Columbus, hereinafter printed,\r\ngives further and most interesting details. It will be enough to say\r\nhere that it resulted in the discovery of the islands of Santa Maria del\r\nConcepcion, Exuma, Isabella, Juana or Cuba, Bohio, the Cuban Archipelago\r\n(named by its finder the Jardin del Rey), the island of Santa Catalina,\r\nand that of Española, now called Haiti or San Domingo. Off the last of\r\nthese the Santa Maria went aground, owing to the carelessness of the\r\nsteersman. No lives were lost, but the ship had to be unloaded and\r\nabandoned; and Columbus, who was anxious to return to Europe with the\r\nnews of his achievement, resolved to plant a colony on the island, to\r\nbuild a fort out of the material of the stranded hulk, and to leave the\r\ncrew. The fort was called La Navidad; forty-three Europeans were placed\r\nin charge, including the Governor Diego de Arana; two lieutenants, Pedro\r\nGutierrez and Rodrigo de Escobedo; an Irishman named William Ires\r\n(? Harris), a native of Galway; an Englishman whose name is given as\r\nTallarte de Lajes,[7] and the remainder being Spaniards.\r\n\r\nOn January 16, 1493, Columbus, who had lost sight of Martin Pinzon, set\r\nsail alone in the Niña for the east; and four days afterward the Pinta\r\njoined her sister ship off Monte Christo. A storm, however, separated\r\nthe vessels, during which (according to Las Casas) Columbus, fearing the\r\nvessel would founder, cast his duplicate log-book, which was written on\r\nparchment and inclosed in a cake of wax, inside a barrel, into the sea.\r\nThe log contained a promise of a thousand ducats to the finder on\r\ndelivering it to the King of Spain. Then a long battle with the trade\r\nwinds caused great delay, and it was not until February 18th that\r\nColumbus reached the Island of Santa Maria in the Azores. Here he was\r\nthreatened with capture by the Portuguese governor, who could not for\r\nsome time be brought to recognize his commission. On February 24th,\r\nhowever, he was allowed to proceed, and on March 4th the Niña dropped\r\nanchor off Lisbon. The King of Portugal received the Admiral with the\r\nhighest honors; and on March 13th the Niña put out from the Tagus, and\r\ntwo days afterward, Friday, March 15th, dropped anchor off Palos.\r\n\r\nThe court was at Barcelona, and thither, after dispatching a letter[8]\r\nannouncing his arrival, Columbus proceeded in person. He entered the\r\ncity in a sort of triumphal procession, and was received by their\r\nMajesties in full court, and, seated in their presence, related the\r\nstory of his wanderings, exhibiting the \"rich and strange\" spoils of the\r\nnew-found lands--the gold, the cotton, the parrots, the curious arms,\r\nthe mysterious plants, the unknown birds and beasts, and the nine\r\nIndians he had brought with him for baptism. All his honors and\r\nprivileges were confirmed to him; the title of Don was conferred on\r\nhimself and his brothers; he rode at the King's bridle; he was served\r\nand saluted as a grandee of Spain. And, greatest honor of all, a new and\r\nmagnificent escutcheon was blazoned for him (May 4, 1493), whereon the\r\nroyal castle and lion of Castille and Leon were combined with the four\r\nanchors of his own old coat of arms. Nor were their Catholic Highnesses\r\nless busy on their own account than on that of their servant. On May 3d\r\nand 4th, Alexander VI. granted bulls confirming to the crowns of\r\nCastille and Leon all the lands discovered,[9] or to be discovered,\r\nbeyond a certain line of demarcation, on the same terms as those on\r\nwhich the Portuguese held their colonies along the African coast. A new\r\nexpedition was got in readiness with all possible dispatch to secure and\r\nextend the discoveries already made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DE BRY PORTRAIT OF COLUMBUS.]\r\n\r\nAfter several delays the fleet weighed anchor on September 25th and\r\nsteered westward. It consisted of three great carracks (galleons) and\r\nfourteen caravels (light frigates), having on board about 1,500 men,\r\nbesides the animals and materials necessary for colonization. Twelve\r\nmissionaries accompanied the expedition, under the orders of Bernardo\r\nBoyle, a Benedictine friar; and Columbus had been directed (May 29,\r\n1493) to endeavor by all means in his power to christianize the\r\ninhabitants of the islands, to make them presents, and to \"honor them\r\nmuch,\" while all under him were commanded to treat them \"well and\r\nlovingly,\" under pain of severe punishment. On October 13th the ships,\r\nwhich had put in at the Canaries, left Ferrol, and so early as Sunday,\r\nNovember 3d, after a single storm, \"by the goodness of God and the wise\r\nmanagement of the Admiral,\" land was sighted to the west, which was\r\nnamed Dominica. Northward from this new-found island the isles of Maria\r\nGalante and Guadaloupe were discovered and named; and on the\r\nnorthwestern course to La Navidad, those of Montserrat, Antigua, San\r\nMartin, and Santa Cruz were sighted, and the island now called Puerto\r\nRico was touched at, hurriedly explored, and named San Juan. On November\r\n22d Columbus came in sight of Española, and, sailing eastward to La\r\nNavidad, found the fort burned and the colony dispersed. He decided on\r\nbuilding a second fort, and, coasting on forty miles east of Cape\r\nHaytien, he pitched on a spot, where he founded the city and settlement\r\nof Isabella.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the first notice of india rubber on record is\r\ngiven by Herrera, who, in the second voyage of Columbus, observed that\r\nthe natives of Haiti \"played a game with balls made of the gum of a\r\ntree.\"\r\n\r\nThe character in which Columbus had appeared had till now been that of\r\nthe greatest of mariners; but from this point forward his claims to\r\nsupremacy are embarrassed and complicated with the long series of\r\nfailures, vexations, miseries, insults, that have rendered his career as\r\na planter of colonies and as a ruler of men most pitiful and remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Navidad proved unhealthy; the colonists were greedy of\r\ngold, impatient of control, and as proud, ignorant, and mutinous as\r\nSpaniards could be; and Columbus, whose inclinations drew him westward,\r\nwas doubtless glad to escape the worry and anxiety of his post, and to\r\navail himself of the instructions of his sovereigns as to further\r\ndiscoveries. In January, 1494, he sent home, by Antonio de Torres, that\r\ndispatch to their Catholic Highnesses by which he may be said to have\r\nfounded the West Indian slave trade. He founded the mining camp of San\r\nTomaso in the gold country; and on April 24, 1494, having nominated a\r\ncouncil of regency under his brother Diego, and appointed Pedro de\r\nMargarite his captain-general, he put again to sea. After following the\r\nsouthern shore of Cuba for some days, he steered southward, and\r\ndiscovered the Island of Jamaica, which he named Santiago. He then\r\nresumed his exploration of the Cuban coast, threading his way through a\r\nlabyrinth of islets supposed to be the Morant Keys, which he named the\r\nGarden of the Queen, and after coasting westward for many days he became\r\nconvinced that he had discovered the mainland, and called Perez de Luna,\r\nthe notary, to draw up a document attesting his discovery (June 12,\r\n1494), which was afterward taken round and signed, in presence of four\r\nwitnesses, by the masters, mariners, and seamen of his three caravels,\r\nthe Niña, the Cadera, and the San Juan. He then stood to the southeast\r\nand sighted the Island of Evangelista; and after many days of\r\ndifficulties and anxieties he touched at and named the Island La Mona.\r\nThence he had intended to sail eastward and complete the survey of the\r\nCarribbean Archipelago. But he was exhausted by the terrible wear and\r\ntear of mind and body he had undergone (he says himself that on this\r\nexpedition he was three-and-thirty days almost without any sleep), and\r\non the day following his departure from La Mona he fell into a lethargy\r\nthat deprived him of sense and memory, and had well nigh proved fatal to\r\nlife. At last, on September 29th, the little fleet dropped anchor off\r\nIsabella, and in his new city the great Admiral lay sick for five\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe colony was in a sad plight. Everyone was discontented, and many were\r\nsick, for the climate was unhealthy and there was nothing to eat.\r\nMargarite and Boyle had quitted Española for Spain; but ere his\r\ndeparture the former, in his capacity as captain-general, had done much\r\nto outrage and alienate the Indians. The strongest measures were\r\nnecessary to undo this mischief; and, backed by his brother Bartholomew,\r\na bold and skillful mariner, and a soldier of courage and resource, who\r\nhad been with Diaz in his voyage around the Cape of Good Hope, Columbus\r\nproceeded to reduce the natives under Spanish sway.[10] Alonzo de Ojeda\r\nsucceeded, by a brilliant _coup de main_, in capturing the Cacique\r\nCaonabo, and the rest submitted. Five ship-loads of Indians were sent\r\noff to Seville (June 24, 1495) to be sold as slaves; and a tribute was\r\nimposed upon their fellows, which must be looked upon as the origin of\r\nthat system of _repartimientos_ or _encomiendas_ which was afterward to\r\nwork such cruel mischief among the conquered. But the tide of court\r\nfavor seemed to have turned against Columbus. In October, 1495, Juan\r\nAguada arrived at Isabella, with an open commission from their Catholic\r\nMajesties, to inquire into the circumstances of his rule; and much\r\ninterest and recrimination followed. Columbus found that there was no\r\ntime to be lost in returning home; he appointed his brother Bartholomew\r\n\"adelantado\" of the island, and on March 10, 1496, he quitted Española\r\nin the Niña. The vessel, after a protracted and perilous voyage, reached\r\nCadiz on June 11, 1496. The Admiral landed in great dejection, wearing\r\nthe costume of a Franciscan. Reassured, however, by the reception of his\r\nsovereigns, he asked at once for eight ships more, two to be sent to the\r\ncolony with supplies and six to be put under his orders for new\r\ndiscoveries. The request was not immediately granted, as the Spanish\r\nexchequer was not then well supplied. But principally owing to the\r\ninterest of the Queen, an agreement was come to similar to that of 1492,\r\nwhich was now confirmed. By this royal patent, moreover, a tract of land\r\nin Española, of fifty leagues by twenty, was made over to him. He was\r\noffered a dukedom or a marquisate at his pleasure; for three years he\r\nwas to receive an eighth of the gross and a tenth of the net profits on\r\neach voyage, the right of creating a mayorazgo or perpetual entail of\r\ntitles and estates was granted him, and on June 24th his two sons were\r\nreceived into Isabella's service as pages. Meanwhile, however, the\r\npreparing of the fleet proceeded slowly, and it was not till May 30,\r\n1498, that he and his six ships set sail.\r\n\r\nFrom San Lucar he steered for Gomera, in the Canaries, and thence\r\ndispatched three of his ships to San Domingo. He next proceeded to the\r\nCape Verde Islands, which he quitted on July 4th. On the 31st of the\r\nsame month, being greatly in need of water, and fearing that no land lay\r\nwestward as they had hoped, Columbus had turned his ship's head north,\r\nwhen Alonzo Perez, a mariner of Huelva, saw land about fifteen leagues\r\nto the southwest. It was crowned with three hilltops, and so, when the\r\nsailors had sung the _Salve Regina_, the Admiral named it Trinidad,\r\nwhich name it yet bears. On Wednesday, August 1st, he beheld for the\r\nfirst time, in the mainland of South America, the continent he had\r\nsought so long. It seemed to him but an insignificant island, and he\r\ncalled it Zeta. Sailing westward, next day he saw the Gulf of Paria,\r\nwhich was named by him the Golfo de la Belena, and was borne into it--an\r\nimmense risk--on the ridge of breakers formed by the meeting with the\r\nsea of the great rivers that empty themselves, all swollen with rain,\r\ninto the ocean. For many days he coasted the continent, esteeming as\r\nislands the several projections he saw and naming them accordingly; nor\r\nwas it until he had looked on and considered the immense volume of fresh\r\nwater poured out through the embouchure of the river now called the\r\nOrinoco, that he concluded that the so-called archipelago must be in\r\nvery deed a great continent.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately at this time he was suffering intolerably from gout and\r\nophthalmia; his ships were crazy; and he was anxious to inspect the\r\ninfant colony whence he had been absent so long. And so, after touching\r\nat and naming the Island of Margarita, he bore away to the northeast,\r\nand on August 30th the fleet dropped anchor off Isabella.\r\n\r\nHe found that affairs had not prospered well in his absence. By the\r\nvigor and activity of the adelantado, the whole island had been reduced\r\nunder Spanish sway, but at the expense of the colonists. Under the\r\nleadership of a certain Roldan, a bold and unprincipled adventurer, they\r\nhad risen in revolt, and Columbus had to compromise matters in order to\r\nrestore peace. Roldan retained his office; such of his followers as\r\nchose to remain in the island were gratified with _repartimientos_ of\r\nland and labor; and some fifteen, choosing to return to Spain, were\r\nenriched with a number of slaves, and sent home in two ships, which\r\nsailed in the early part of October, 1499.\r\n\r\nFive ship-loads of Indians had been deported to Spain some little time\r\nbefore. On arrival of these living cargoes at Seville, the Queen, the\r\nstanch and steady friend of Columbus, was moved with compassion and\r\nindignation. No one, she declared, had authorized him to dispose of her\r\nvassals in any such manner; and proclamations at Seville, Granada, and\r\nother chief places ordered (June 20, 1499) the instant liberation and\r\nreturn of all the last gang of Indians. In addition to this, the\r\nex-colonists had become incensed against Columbus and his brothers. They\r\nwere wont to parade their grievances in the very court-yards of the\r\nAlhambra; to surround the King, when he came forth, with complaints and\r\nreclamations; to insult the discoverer's young sons with shouts and\r\njeers. There was no doubt that the colony itself, whatever the cause,\r\nhad not prospered so well as might have been desired. Historians do not\r\nhesitate to aver that Columbus' over-colored and unreliable statements\r\nas to the amount of gold to be found there were the chief causes of\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nAnd, on the whole, it is not surprising that Ferdinand, whose support to\r\nColumbus had never been very hearty, should about this time have\r\ndetermined to suspend him. Accordingly, on March 21, 1499, Francisco de\r\nBobadilla was ordered to \"ascertain what persons had raised themselves\r\nagainst justice in the Island of Española, and to proceed against them\r\naccording to law.\" On May 21st the government of the island was\r\nconferred on him, and he was accredited with an order that all arms and\r\nfortresses should be handed over to him; and on May 26th he received a\r\nletter, for delivery to Columbus, stating that the bearer would \"speak\r\ncertain things to him\" on the part of their Highnesses, and praying him\r\nto \"give faith and credence, and to act accordingly.\" Bobadilla left\r\nSpain in July, 1500, and landed in Española in October.\r\n\r\nColumbus, meanwhile, had restored such tranquillity as was possible in\r\nhis government. With Roldan's help he had beaten off an attempt on the\r\nisland by the adventurer Ojeda, his old lieutenant; the Indians were\r\nbeing collected into villages and christianized. Gold mining was\r\nactively and profitably pursued; in three years, he calculated, the\r\nroyal revenues might be raised to an average of 60,000,000 reals. The\r\narrival of Bobadilla, however, on August 23, 1500, speedily changed this\r\nstate of affairs into a greater and more pitiable confusion than the\r\nisland had ever before witnessed. On landing, he took possession of the\r\nAdmiral's house, and summoned him and his brothers before him.\r\nAccusations of severity, of injustice, of venality even, were poured\r\ndown on their heads, and Columbus anticipated nothing less than a\r\nshameful death. Bobadilla put all three in irons, and shipped them off\r\nto Spain.\r\n\r\nAndreas Martin, captain of the caravel in which the illustrious\r\nprisoners sailed, still retained a proper sense of the honor and respect\r\ndue to Columbus, and would have removed the fetters; but to this\r\nColumbus would not consent. He would wear them until their Highnesses,\r\nby whose order they had been affixed, should order their removal; and he\r\nwould keep them afterward \"as relics and memorials of the reward of his\r\nservices.\" He did so. His son Hernando \"saw them always hanging in his\r\ncabinet, and he requested that when he died they might be buried with\r\nhim.\" Whether this last wish was complied with is not known.\r\n\r\nA heart-broken and indignant letter from Columbus to Doña Juana de la\r\nTorres, the governess of the infant Don Juan, arrived at court before\r\nthe dispatch of Bobadilla. It was read to the Queen, and its tidings\r\nwere confirmed by communications from Alonso de Villejo and the alcaide\r\nof Cadiz. There was a great movement of indignation; the tide of\r\npopular and royal feeling turned once more in the Admiral's favor. He\r\nreceived a large sum to defray his expenses; and when he appeared at\r\ncourt, on December 17th, he was no longer in irons and disgrace, but\r\nrichly appareled and surrounded with friends. He was received with all\r\nhonor and distinction. The Queen is said to have been moved to tears by\r\nthe narration of his story. Their Majesties not only repudiated\r\nBobadilla's proceedings, but declined to inquire into the charges that\r\nhe at the same time brought against his prisoners, and promised Columbus\r\ncompensation for his losses and satisfaction for his wrongs. A new\r\ngovernor, Nicolas de Ovando, was appointed in Bobadilla's room, and left\r\nSan Lucar on February 18, 1502, with a fleet of thirty ships. The latter\r\nwas to be impeached and sent home. The Admiral's property was to be\r\nrestored and a fresh start was to be made in the conduct of colonial\r\naffairs. Thus ended Columbus' history as viceroy and governor of the new\r\nIndies, which he had presented to the country of his adoption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEPARTURE OF COLUMBUS TO DISCOVER AMERICA, FROM THE PORT\r\nOF PALOS, SPAIN, ON AUGUST 3, 1492.\r\n\r\nFrom the celebrated painting by Señor A. Gisbert.\r\n\r\n(See page 19.)]\r\n\r\nHis hour of rest, however, was not yet come. Ever anxious to serve their\r\nCatholic Highnesses, \"and particularly the Queen,\" he had determined to\r\nfind a strait through which he might penetrate westward into Portuguese\r\nAsia. After the usual inevitable delays his prayers were granted, and on\r\nMay 9, 1502, with four caravels and 150 men, he weighed anchor from\r\nCadiz and sailed on his fourth and last great voyage. He first betook\r\nhimself to the relief of the Portuguese fort of Arzilla, which had been\r\nbesieged by the Moors, but the siege had been raised voluntarily before\r\nhe arrived. He put to sea westward once more, and on June 13th\r\ndiscovered the Island of Martinique. He had received positive\r\ninstructions from his sovereigns on no account to touch at Española, but\r\nhis largest caravel was greatly in need of repairs, and he had no\r\nchoice but to abandon her or disobey orders. He preferred the latter\r\nalternative, and sent a boat ashore to Ovando, asking for a new ship and\r\nfor permission to enter the harbor to weather a hurricane which he saw\r\nwas coming on. But his requests were refused, and he coasted the island,\r\ncasting anchor under lee of the land. Here he weathered the storm, which\r\ndrove the other caravels out to sea and annihilated the homeward-bound\r\nfleet, the richest till then that had been sent from Española. Roldan\r\nand Bobadilla perished with others of the Admiral's enemies; and\r\nHernando Colon, who accompanied his father on this voyage, wrote, long\r\nyears afterward, \"I am satisfied it was the hand of God, for had they\r\narrived in Spain they had never been punished as their crimes deserved,\r\nbut rather been favored and preferred.\"\r\n\r\nAfter recruiting his flotilla at Azua, Columbus put in at Jaquimo and\r\nrefitted his four vessels, and on July 14, 1502, he steered for Jamaica.\r\nFor nine weeks the ships wandered painfully among the keys and shoals he\r\nhad named the Garden of the Queen, and only an opportune easterly wind\r\nprevented the crews from open mutiny. The first land sighted was the\r\nIslet of Guanaja, about forty miles to the east of the coast of\r\nHonduras. Here he got news from an old Indian of a rich and vast country\r\nlying to the eastward, which he at once concluded must be the\r\nlong-sought-for empire of the Grand Khan. Steering along the coast of\r\nHonduras great hardships were endured, but nothing approaching his ideal\r\nwas discovered. On September 13th Cape Gracias-á-Dios was sighted. The\r\nmen had become clamorous and insubordinate; not until December 5th,\r\nhowever, would he tack about and retrace his course. It now became his\r\nintention to plant a colony on the River Veragua, which was afterward to\r\ngive his descendants a title of nobility; but he had hardly put about\r\nwhen he was caught in a storm which lasted eight days, wrenched and\r\nstrained his crazy, worm-eaten ships severely, and finally, on the\r\nEpiphany, blew him into an embouchure, which he named Bethlehem. Gold\r\nwas very plentiful in this place, and here he determined to found his\r\nsettlement. By the end of March, 1503, a number of huts had been run up,\r\nand in these the adelantado, with eighty men, was to remain, while\r\nColumbus returned to Spain for men and supplies. Quarrels, however,\r\narose with the natives, the adelantado made an attempt to seize on the\r\nperson of the cacique and failed, and before Columbus could leave the\r\ncoast he had to abandon a caravel to take the settlers on board, and to\r\nrelinquish the enterprise. Steering eastward he left a second caravel at\r\nPorto Bello, and on May 31st he bore northward for Cuba, where he\r\nobtained supplies from the natives. From Cuba he bore up for Jamaica,\r\nand there, in the harbor of Santa Gloria, now St. Anne's Bay, he ran his\r\nships aground in a small inlet called Don Christopher's Cove.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was received with the greatest kindness by the natives,\r\nand here Columbus remained upward of a year awaiting the return of his\r\nlieutenant Diego Mendez, whom he had dispatched to Ovando for\r\nassistance. During his critical sojourn here the Admiral suffered much\r\nfrom disease and from the lawlessness of his followers, whose misconduct\r\nhad alienated the natives, and provoked them to withhold their\r\naccustomed supplies, until he dexterously worked upon their\r\nsuperstitions by prognosticating an eclipse. Two vessels having at last\r\narrived for their relief from Mendez and Ovando, Columbus set sail for\r\nSpain, after a tempestuous voyage landing once more at Seville on\r\nSeptember 7, 1504.\r\n\r\nAs he was too ill to go to court, his son Diego was sent thither in his\r\nplace, to look after his interests and transact his business. Letter\r\nafter letter followed the young man from Seville, one by the hands of\r\nAmerigo Vespucci. A license to ride on mule-back was granted him on\r\nFebruary 23, 1505;[11] and in the following May he was removed to the\r\ncourt at Segovia, and thence again to Valladolid. On the landing of\r\nPhilip and Juan at Coruña (April 25, 1506), although \"much oppressed\r\nwith the gout and troubled to see himself put by his rights,\" he is\r\nknown to have sent the adelantado to pay them his duty and to assure\r\nthem that he was yet able to do them extraordinary service. The last\r\ndocumentary note of him is contained in a codicil to the will of 1498,\r\nmade at Valladolid on May 19, 1506; the principal portion is said,\r\nhowever, to have been signed at Segovia on August 25, 1506. By this the\r\nold will is confirmed; the mayorazgo is bequeathed to his son Diego and\r\nhis heirs male; failing these to Hernando, his second son, and failing\r\nthese to the heirs male of Bartholomew. Only in the event of the\r\nextinction of the male line, direct or collateral, is it to descend to\r\nthe females of the family; and those into whose hands it may fall are\r\nnever to diminish it, but always to increase and ennoble it by all means\r\npossible. The head of the house is to sign himself \"The Admiral.\" A\r\ntenth of the annual income is to be set aside yearly for distribution\r\namong the poor relations of the house. A chapel is founded and endowed\r\nfor the saying of masses. Beatrix Enriquez is left to the care of the\r\nyoung Admiral in most grateful terms. Among other legacies is one of\r\n\"half a mark of silver to a Jew who used to live at the gate of the\r\nJewry in Lisbon.\" The codicil was written and signed with the Admiral's\r\nown hand. Next day (May 20, 1506) he died.\r\n\r\nThe body of Columbus was buried in the parish church of Santa Maria de\r\nla Antigua in Valladolid. It was transferred in 1513 to the Cartuja de\r\nlas Cuevas, near Seville, where on the monument was inscribed that\r\nlaconic but pregnant tribute:\r\n\r\n  _Á Castilla y a Leon,\r\n  Nuevo mundo dió Colon._\r\n\r\n  (To Castille and Leon, Columbus gave a new world.)\r\n\r\nHere the bones of Diego, the second Admiral, were also laid. Exhumed in\r\n1536, the bodies of both father and son were taken over sea to Española\r\n(San Domingo), and interred in the cathedral. In 1795-96, on the cession\r\nof that island to the French, the august relics were re-exhumed, and\r\nwere transferred with great state and solemnity to the cathedral of\r\nHavana, where, it is claimed, they yet remain. The male issue of the\r\nAdmiral became extinct with the third generation, and the estates and\r\ntitles passed by marriage to a scion of the house of Braganca.\r\n\r\n\"In person, Columbus was tall and shapely, long-faced and aquiline,\r\nwhite-eyed and auburn-haired, and beautifully complexioned. At thirty\r\nhis hair was quite gray. He was temperate in eating and drinking and in\r\ndress, and so strict in religious matters, that for fasting and saying\r\nall the divine office he might be thought possessed in some religious\r\norder.\" His piety, as his son has noted, was earnest and unwavering; it\r\nentered into and colored alike his action and his speech; he tries his\r\npen in a Latin distich of prayer; his signature is a mystical pietistic\r\ndevice.[12] He was pre-eminently fitted for the task he created for\r\nhimself. Through deceit and opprobrium and disdain he pushed on toward\r\nthe consummation of his desire; and when the hour for action came, the\r\nman was not found wanting.\r\n\r\nWithin the last seven years research and discovery have thrown some\r\ndoubt upon two very important particulars regarding Columbus. One of\r\nthese is the identity of the island which was his first discovery in the\r\nNew World; the other, the final resting-place of his remains.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that Columbus died in Valladolid, and that\r\nhis remains were interred in the church of the Carthusian Monastery at\r\nSeville, nor that, some time between the years 1537 and 1540, in\r\naccordance with a request made in his will, they were removed to the\r\nIsland of Española (Santo Domingo). In 1795, when Spain ceded to France\r\nher portion of the island, Spanish officials obtained permission to\r\nremove to the cathedral at Havana the ashes of the discoverer of\r\nAmerica. There seems to be a question whether the remains which were\r\nthen removed were those of Columbus or his son Don Diego.\r\n\r\nIn 1877, during the progress of certain work in the cathedral at Santo\r\nDomingo, a crypt was disclosed on one side of the altar, and within it\r\nwas found a metallic coffin which contained human remains. The coffin\r\nbore the following inscription: \"The Admiral Don Luis Colon, Duke of\r\nVeragua, Marquis of Jamaica,\" referring, undoubtedly, to the grandson of\r\nColumbus. The archbishop Señor Roque Cocchia then took up the search,\r\nand upon the other side of the altar were found two crypts, one empty,\r\nfrom which had been taken the remains sent to Havana, and the other\r\ncontaining a metallic case. The case bore the inscription: \"D. de la A\r\nPer Ate,\" which was interpreted to mean: \"Descubridor de la America,\r\nPrimer Almirante\" (Discoverer of America, the First Admiral). The box\r\nwas then opened, and on the inside of the cover were the words: \"Illtre\r\ny Esdo Varon, Dn Cristoval Colon\"--Illustrissime y Esclarecido Varon Don\r\nCristoval Colon (Illustrious and renowned man, Don Christopher\r\nColumbus). On the two ends and on the front were the letters,\r\n\"C.C.A.\"--Cristoval Colon, Almirante (Christopher Columbus, Admiral).\r\nThe box contained bones and bone-dust, a small bit of the skull, a\r\nleaden ball, and a silver plate two inches long. On one side of the\r\nplate was inscribed:\r\n\r\n  _Ua. pte. de los rtos\r\n  del pmr. alte D.\r\n  Cristoval Colon Desr._\r\n\r\n  (Urna perteneciente de los restos del Primer Almirante Don\r\n        Cristoval Colon, Descubridor--Urn containing the\r\n             remains of the First Admiral Don Christopher\r\n                   Columbus, Discoverer.)\r\n\r\nOn the other side was: \"U. Cristoval Colon\" (The coffin of Christopher\r\nColumbus).\r\n\r\n\r\nThese discoveries have been certified to by the archbishop Roque\r\nCocchia, and by others, including Don Emiliana Tejera, a well-known\r\ncitizen. The Royal Academy of History at Madrid, however, challenged the\r\nforegoing statements and declared that the remains of Columbus were\r\nelsewhere than at Havana. Tejera and the archbishop have since published\r\nreplies affirming the accuracy of their discovery.[13]\r\n\r\nRegarding the identity of the island first seen by Columbus, Capt. G. V.\r\nFox, in a paper published by the U. S. Coast Survey in 1882, discusses\r\nand reviews the evidence, and draws a different conclusion and inference\r\nfrom that heretofore commonly accepted. His paper is based upon the\r\noriginal journals and log-book of Columbus, which were published in 1790\r\nby Don M. F. Navarrete, from a manuscript of Bishop Las Casas, the\r\ncontemporary and friend of Columbus, found in the archives of the Duke\r\ndel Infanta. In this the exact words of the Admiral's diary are\r\nreproduced by Las Casas, extending from the 11th to the 29th of\r\nOctober, the landing being on the 12th. From the description the diary\r\ngives, and from a projection of a voyage of Columbus before and after\r\nlanding, Capt. Fox concludes that the island discovered was neither\r\nGrand Turk's, Mariguana, Watling's, nor Cat Island (Guanahani), but\r\nSamana, lat. 23 deg. 05 min., N.; long. 75 deg. 35 min., W.\r\n\r\nIf we accept the carefully drawn deductions of Capt. Fox there is reason\r\nto believe that the island discovered was Samana.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Markham, in his \"Life of Columbus,\" advances the ingenious\r\nsuggestion of a marriage invalidated by the pre-contract of Beatrix to\r\none Enriquez. No authority is adduced for this theory.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The monastery has been restored and preserved as a national\r\nmemorial since 1846.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The invention of the mariner's compass is claimed by the\r\nChinese for the Emperor Hong-ti, a grandson of Noah, about 2634 B. C. A\r\ncompass was brought from China to Queen Elizabeth A. D. 1260 by P.\r\nVenutus. By some the invention is ascribed to Marcus Paulus, a Venetian,\r\nA. D. 1260. The discovery of the compass was long attributed to Flavio\r\nGioja, a Neapolitan sailor, A. D. 1302, who in reality made improvements\r\non then existing patterns and brought them to the form now used. The\r\nvariation of the needle was known to the Chinese, being mentioned in the\r\nworks of the Chinese philosopher Keon-tsoung-chy, who flourished about\r\nA. D. 1111. The dip of the needle was discovered A. D. 1576 by Robert\r\nNorman of London. Time was measured on voyages by the hour-glass.\r\nCompare Shakespere:\r\n\r\n  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass\r\n  Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Capt. Parker, in _Goldthwaithe's Geographical Monthly_,\r\nargues ably that the myth that a light was seen by Columbus at 8 P. M.\r\nof the night of the discovery should be dropped simply as rubbish; it is\r\nincredible. More than one hundred men in the three vessels were\r\nanxiously looking for signs of land, and two \"think\" they see a light.\r\nTo say that Columbus felt sure that he saw a light is to pronounce him\r\nan imbecile. For if ahead, he would have stopped; if abeam, stood for\r\nit. His log does not say where or in what direction the light was--an\r\nimportant omission--and Columbus _ran forty sea miles after he saw this\r\nmythical light_.\r\n\r\nWe may safely decide that Watling Island, named after a buccaneer or\r\npirate of the seventeenth century, is best supported by investigation as\r\nthe landfall of Columbus.\r\n\r\nCronau, who visited Watling Island in 1890, supposes that Columbus'\r\nships, after making the land, continued on their course, under the\r\nreduced sail, at the rate of four or five miles an hour; and at daylight\r\nfound themselves off the northwest end of the island. Mr. Cronau\r\nevidently is not a seafaring man or he would know that no navigator off\r\nan unknown island at night would stand on, even at the rate of one mile\r\nan hour, ignorant of what shoal or reefs might lie off the end of the\r\nisland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The following from Las Casas' epitome of the log is all the\r\ninformation we have concerning the \"sighting\" of the New World:\r\n\r\n\"THURSDAY, October 11, 1492.--_Navegó al Ouesudueste, turvieron mucho\r\nmar mas que en todo el viage habian tenido. Despues del sol puesto\r\nnavegó á su primer Camino al Oueste; andarian doce millas cada hora. A\r\nlas dos horas despues de media noche pareció la tierra, de la cual\r\nestarian dos leguas. Amainaron todas las velas y quedaron con el treo\r\nque es la vela grande sin bonetas, y pusiérouse á la corda temporizando\r\nhasta el dia viernes que llegaron á uná isleta de los Lucayos que se\r\nllamaba en lengua de indios Guanahani._\"\r\n\r\nThat is: \"They steered west-southwest and experienced a much heavier sea\r\nthan they had had before in the whole voyage. After sunset they resumed\r\ntheir former course west, and sailed twelve miles an hour. At 2 o'clock\r\nin the morning the land appeared (was sighted), two leagues off. They\r\nlowered all the sails and remained under the storm sail, which is the\r\nmain sail without bonnets, and hove to, waiting for daylight; and Friday\r\n[found they had] arrived at a small island of the Lucayos which the\r\nIndians called Guanahani.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that these are the words of Las Casas, and they were\r\nevidently written some years after the event.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Helps refers to the island as \"one of the Bahamas.\" It has\r\nbeen variously identified with Turks Island, by Navarette (1825); with\r\nCat Island, by Irving (1828) and Humboldt (1836); with Mayaguara, by\r\nVarnhagen (1864); and finally, with greatest show of probability, with\r\nWatling Island, by Muñoz (1798), supported by Becher (1856), Peschel\r\n(1857), and Major (1871).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See page 217, _post_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The greatest blot on the character of Columbus is contained\r\nin this and a succeeding letter. Under the shallow pretense of\r\nbenefiting the souls of idolators, he suggested to the Spanish rulers\r\nthe advisability of shipping the natives to Spain as slaves. He appeals\r\nto their cupidity by picturing the revenue to be derived therefrom, and\r\nstands convicted in the light of history as the prime author of that\r\nblood-drenched rule which exterminated millions of simple aborigines in\r\nthe West Indian Archipelago.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The countries which he had discovered were considered as a\r\npart of India. In consequence of this notion the name of Indies is given\r\nto them by Ferdinand and Isabella in a ratification of their former\r\nagreement, which was granted to Columbus after his return.--Robertson's\r\n\"History of America.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The will of Diego Mendez, one of Columbus' most trusted\r\nfollowers, states that the Governor of Xaragua in seven months burned\r\nand hanged eighty-four chiefs, including the Queen of San Domingo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Owing to the difficulty in securing animals for the\r\ncavalry in Spain (about A. D. 1505), an edict had been published by the\r\nKing forbidding the use of mules in traveling, except by royal\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nWhile Columbus was in Seville he wished to make a journey to the court,\r\nthen sitting at Granada, to plead his own cause. Cardinal Mendoza placed\r\nhis litter at the disposal of the Admiral, but he preferred a mule, and\r\nwrote to Diego, asking him to petition the King for the privilege of\r\nusing one. The request was granted in the following curious document:\r\n\r\n_Decree granting to Don Cristoval Colon permission to ride on a mule,\r\nsaddled and bridled, through any part of these Kingdoms._\r\n\r\n     THE KING: As I am informed that you, Cristoval Colon, the Admiral,\r\n     are in poor bodily health, owing to certain diseases which you had\r\n     or have, and that you can not ride on horse-back without injury to\r\n     your health; therefore, conceding this to your advanced age, I, by\r\n     these presents, grant you leave to ride on a mule, saddled and\r\n     bridled, through whatever parts of these kingdoms or realms you\r\n     wish and choose, notwithstanding the law which I issued thereto;\r\n     and I command the subjects of all parts of these kingdoms and\r\n     realms not to offer you any impediment or allow any to be offered\r\n     to you, under penalty of ten thousand maravedi in behalf of the\r\n     treasury, of whoever does the contrary.\r\n\r\n     Given in the City of Toro, February 23, 1505.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12:\r\n\r\n      .s.\r\n   .s. s .s.\r\n    X  M  Y\r\n  XPO FERENS.\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS' CIPHER.--The interpretation of the seven-lettered cipher,\r\naccepting the smaller letters of the second line as the final ones of\r\nthe words, seems to be _Servate-me, Xristus, Maria, Yosephus_.

I have\r\n     visited all known quarters of the world and have conversed with a\r\n     great number of learned men--with ecclesiastics, with seculars,\r\n     with Latins, with Greeks, with Moors, and with persons of all sorts\r\n     of religions. I have acquired some knowledge of navigation, of\r\n     astronomy, and of geometry. I am sufficiently expert in designing\r\n     the chart of the earth to place the cities, the rivers, and the\r\n     mountains where they are situated.

H. Major, F. S. A., Keeper of the Department of Maps and Charts\r\n     in the British Museum and Honorary Secretary of the Royal\r\n     Geographical Society of England, states that the peculiar value of\r\n     the following letter, descriptive of the first important voyage of\r\n     Columbus, is that the events described are from the pen of him to\r\n     whom the events occurred. In it we have laid before us, as it were\r\n     from Columbus' own mouth, a clear statement of his opinions and\r\n     conjectures on what were to him great cosmical riddles--riddles\r\n     which have since been solved mainly through the light which his\r\n     illustrious deeds have shed upon the field of our observation:\r\n\r\n_Sir: Believing that you will take pleasure in hearing of the great\r\nsuccess which our Lord has granted me in my voyage, I write you this\r\nletter, whereby you will learn how in thirty-three[15] days' time I\r\nreached the Indies with the fleet which the most illustrious King and\r\nQueen, our Sovereigns, gave to me, where I found very many islands\r\nthickly peopled, of all which I took possession, without resistance, for\r\ntheir Highnesses, by proclamation made and with the royal standard\r\nunfurled. To the first island that I found I gave the name of San\r\nSalvador,[16] in remembrance of His High Majesty, who hath marvelously\r\nbrought all these things to pass; the Indians call it Guanahani. To the\r\nsecond island I gave the name of Santa Maria de Conception; the third I\r\ncalled Fernandina; the fourth, Isabella; the fifth, Juana; and so to\r\neach one I gave a new name._\r\n\r\n_When I reached Juana, I followed its coast to the westward, and found\r\nit so large that I thought it must be the mainland,--the province of\r\nCathay; and as I found neither towns nor villages on the sea-coast, but\r\nonly a few hamlets, with the inhabitants of which I could not hold\r\nconversation because they all immediately fled, I kept on the same\r\nroute, thinking that I could not fail to light upon some large cities\r\nand towns._\r\n\r\n_At length, after proceeding of many leagues and finding that nothing\r\nnew presented itself, and that the coast was leading me northward (which\r\nI wished to avoid, because winter had already set in, and it was my\r\nintention to move southward; and because, moreover, the winds were\r\ncontrary), I resolved not to wait for a change in the weather, but\r\nreturned to a certain harbor which I had remarked, and from which I sent\r\ntwo men ashore to ascertain whether there was any king or large cities\r\nin that part. They journeyed for three days and found countless small\r\nhamlets with numberless inhabitants, but with nothing like order; they\r\ntherefore returned. In the meantime I had learned from some other\r\nIndians whom I had seized that this land was certainly an island;\r\naccordingly, I followed the coast eastward for a distance of 107\r\nleagues, where it ended in a cape. From this cape I saw another island\r\nto the eastward, at a distance of eighteen leagues from the former, to\r\nwhich I gave the name of \"La Española.\" Thither I went, and followed its\r\nnorthern coast to the eastward (just as I had done with the coast of\r\nJuana) 178 full leagues due east. This island like all the others is\r\nextraordinarily large, and this one extremely so. In it are many\r\nseaports, with which none that I know in Christendom can bear\r\ncomparison, so good and capacious that it is wonder to see. The lands\r\nare high, and there are many very lofty mountains with which the island\r\nof Cetefrey can not be compared. They are all most beautiful, of a\r\nthousand different shapes, accessible, and covered with trees of a\r\nthousand kinds, of such great height that they seemed to reach the\r\nskies. I am told that the trees never lose their foliage, and I can well\r\nunderstand it, for I observed that they were as green and luxuriant as\r\nin Spain in the month of May. Some were in bloom, others bearing fruit,\r\nand others otherwise, according to their nature. The nightingale was\r\nsinging as well as other birds of a thousand different kinds; and that\r\nin November, the month in which I myself was roaming amongst them. There\r\nare palm trees of six or eight kinds, wonderful in their beautiful\r\nvariety; but this is the case with all the other trees and fruits and\r\ngrasses; trees, plants, or fruits filled us with admiration. It contains\r\nextraordinary pine groves and very extensive plains. There is also\r\nhoney, a great variety of birds, and many different kinds of fruits. In\r\nthe interior there are many mines of metals and a population\r\ninnumerable. Española is a wonder. Its mountains and plains, and meadows\r\nand fields, are so beautiful and rich for planting and sowing, and\r\nrearing cattle of all kinds, and for building towns and villages. The\r\nharbors on the coast, and the number and size and wholesomeness of the\r\nrivers, most of them bearing gold, surpass anything that would be\r\nbelieved by one who had not seen them. There is a great difference\r\nbetween the trees, fruits, and plants of this island and those of Juana.\r\nIn this island there are many spices and extensive mines of gold and\r\nother metals. The inhabitants of this and of all the other islands I\r\nhave found or gained intelligence of, both men and women, go as naked as\r\nthey were born, with the exception that some of the women cover one part\r\nonly with a single leaf of grass or with a piece of cotton made for\r\nthat purpose. They have neither iron nor steel nor arms, nor are they\r\ncompetent to use them; not that they are not well-formed and of handsome\r\nstature, but because they are timid to a surprising degree. Their only\r\narms are reeds, cut in the seeding time,_[17] _to which they fasten\r\nsmall sharpened sticks, and even these they dare not use; for on several\r\noccasions it has happened that I have sent ashore two or three men to\r\nsome village to hold a parley, and the people have come out in countless\r\nnumbers, but as soon as they saw our men approach, would flee with such\r\nprecipitation that a father would not even stop to protect his son; and\r\nthis not because any harm had been done to any of them, for from the\r\nfirst, wherever I went and got speech with them, I gave them of all that\r\nI had, such as cloth and many other things, without receiving anything\r\nin return; but they are, as I have described, incurably timid. It is\r\ntrue that when they are reassured and thrown off this fear they are\r\nguileless, and so liberal of all they have that no one would believe it\r\nwho had not seen it. They never refuse anything that they possess when\r\nit is asked of them; on the contrary, they offer it themselves, and they\r\nexhibit so much loving kindness that they would even give their hearts;\r\nand, whether it be something of value or of little worth that is offered\r\nto them, they are satisfied. I forbade that worthless things, such as\r\npieces of broken porringers and broken glass, and ends of straps, should\r\nbe given to them; although, when they succeeded in obtaining them, they\r\nthought they possessed the finest jewel in the world. It was ascertained\r\nthat a sailor received for a leather strap a piece of gold weighing two\r\ncastellanos_[18] _and a half, and others received for other objects, of\r\nfar less value, much more. For new blancas_[19] _they would give all\r\nthey had, whether it was two or three castellanos in gold or one or two\r\narrobas[20] of spun cotton. They took even bits of the broken hoops of\r\nthe wine barrels, and gave, like fools, all that they possessed in\r\nexchange, insomuch that I thought it was wrong and forbade it. I gave\r\naway a thousand good and pretty articles which I had brought with me in\r\norder to win their affection; and that they might be led to become\r\nChristians, and be well inclined to love and serve their Highnesses and\r\nthe whole Spanish nation, and that they might aid us by giving us things\r\nof which we stand in need, but which they possess in abundance. They are\r\nnot acquainted with any kind of worship, and are not idolaters; but\r\nbelieve that all power and, indeed, all good things are in heaven; and\r\nthey are firmly convinced that I, with my vessels and crews, came from\r\nheaven, and with this belief received me at every place at which I\r\ntouched, after they had overcome their apprehension. And this does not\r\nspring from ignorance, for they are very intelligent, and navigate all\r\nthese seas, and relate everything to us, so that it is astonishing what\r\na good account they are able to give of everything; but they have never\r\nseen men with clothes on, nor vessels like ours. On my reaching the\r\nIndies, I took by force, in the first island that I discovered, some of\r\nthese natives, that they might learn our language and give me\r\ninformation in regard to what existed in these parts; and it so happened\r\nthat they soon understood us and we them, either by words or signs, and\r\nthey have been very serviceable to us. They are still with me, and, from\r\nrepeated conversations that I have had with them, I find that they still\r\nbelieve that I come from heaven. And they were the first to say this\r\nwherever I went, and the others ran from house to house and to the\r\nneighboring villages, crying with a loud voice: \"Come, come, and see the\r\npeople from heaven!\" And thus they all, men as well as women, after\r\ntheir minds were at rest about us, came, both large and small, and\r\nbrought us something to eat and drink, which they gave us with\r\nextraordinary kindness. They have in all these islands very many canoes\r\nlike our rowboats; some larger, some smaller, but most of them larger\r\nthan a barge of eighteen seats. They are not so wide, because they are\r\nmade of one single piece of timber; but a barge could not keep up with\r\nthem in rowing, because they go with incredible speed, and with these\r\ncanoes they navigate among these islands, which are innumerable, and\r\ncarry on their traffic. I have seen in some of these canoes seventy and\r\neighty men, each with his oar. In all these islands I did not notice\r\nmuch difference in the appearance of the inhabitants, nor in their\r\nmanners, nor language, except that they all understood each other, which\r\nis very singular, and leads me to hope that their Highnesses will take\r\nmeans for their conversion to our holy faith, toward which they are very\r\nwell disposed. I have already said how I had gone 107 leagues in\r\nfollowing the seacoast of Juana in a straight line from west to east;\r\nand from that survey I can state that the island is larger than England\r\nand Scotland together, because beyond these 107 leagues there lie to the\r\nwest two provinces which I have not yet visited, one of which is called\r\nAvan, where the people are born with a tail. These two provinces can not\r\nbe less than from fifty to sixty leagues, from what can be learned from\r\nthe Indians that I have with me, and who are acquainted with all these\r\nislands. The other, Española, has a greater circumference than all\r\nSpain, from Catalonia by the seacoast to Fuenterabia in Biscay, since on\r\none of its four sides I made 188 great leagues in a straight line from\r\nwest to east. This is something to covet, and, when found, not to be\r\nlost sight of. Although I have taken possession of all these islands in\r\nthe name of their Highnesses, and they are all more abundant in wealth\r\nthan I am able to express; and although I hold them all for their\r\nHighnesses, so that they can dispose of them quite as absolutely as they\r\ncan of the kingdoms of Castille, yet there was one large town in\r\nEspañola of which especially I took possession, situated in a locality\r\nwell adapted for the working of the gold mines, and for all kinds of\r\ncommerce, either with the mainland on this side or with that beyond,\r\nwhich is the land of the Great Khan, with which there will be vast\r\ncommerce and great profit. To that city I gave the name of Villa de\r\nNavidad, and fortified it with a fortress, which by this time will be\r\nquite completed, and I have left in it a sufficient number of men with\r\narms,[21] artillery, and provisions for more than a year, a barge, and a\r\nsailing master skillful in the arts necessary for building others. I\r\nhave also established the greatest friendship with the King of that\r\ncountry, so much so that he took pride in calling me his brother, and\r\ntreating me as such. Even should these people change their intentions\r\ntoward us and become hostile, they do not know what arms are, but, as I\r\nhave said, go naked, and are the most timid people in the world; so that\r\nthe men I have left could, alone, destroy the whole country, and this\r\nisland has no danger for them, if they only know how to conduct\r\nthemselves. In all those islands it seems to me that the men are content\r\nwith one wife, except their chief or king, to whom they give twenty. The\r\nwomen seem to me to work more than the men. I have not been able to\r\nlearn whether they have any property of their own. It seems to me that\r\nwhat one possessed belonged to all, especially in the matter of\r\neatables. I have not found in those islands any monsters, as many\r\nimagined; but, on the contrary, the whole race is well formed, nor are\r\nthey black as in Guinea, but their hair is flowing, for they do not\r\ndwell in that part where the force of the sun's rays is too powerful. It\r\nis true that the sun has very great power there, for the country is\r\ndistant only twenty-six degrees from the equinoctial line. In the\r\nislands where there are high mountains, the cold this winter was very\r\ngreat, but they endure it, not only from being habituated to it, but by\r\neating meat with a variety of excessively hot spices. As to savages, I\r\ndid not even hear of any, except at an island which lies the second in\r\none's way coming to the Indies._[22] _It is inhabited by a race which is\r\nregarded throughout these islands as extremely ferocious, and eaters of\r\nhuman flesh. These possess many canoes, in which they visit all the\r\nIndian islands, and rob and plunder whatever they can. They are no worse\r\nformed than the rest, except that they are in the habit of wearing their\r\nhair long, like women, and use bows and arrows made of reeds, with a\r\nsmall stick at the end, for want of iron, which they do not possess.\r\nThey are ferocious amongst these exceedingly timid people; but I think\r\nno more of them than of the rest. These are they which have intercourse\r\nwith the women of Matenino,[23] the first island one comes to on the way\r\nfrom Spain to the Indies, and in which there are no men. These women\r\nemploy themselves in no labor suitable to their sex, but use bows and\r\narrows made of reeds like those above described, and arm and cover\r\nthemselves with plates of copper, of which metal they have a great\r\nquantity._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RETURN OF COLUMBUS IN CHAINS TO SPAIN.\r\n\r\nMarble statuary by Señor V. Vallmitjana, formerly in the Ministry of the\r\nColonies, Madrid; now in Havana, Cuba. (See page 31.)]\r\n\r\n_They assure me that there is another island larger than Española in\r\nwhich the inhabitants have no hair. It is extremely rich in gold; and I\r\nbring with me Indians taken from these different islands, who will\r\ntestify to all these things. Finally, and speaking only of what has\r\ntaken place in this voyage, which has been so hasty, their Highnesses\r\nmay see that I shall give them all the gold they require, if they will\r\ngive me but a very little assistance; spices also, and cotton, as much\r\nas their Highnesses shall command to be shipped; and mastic--hitherto\r\nfound only in Greece, in the Island of Chios, and which the Signoria[24]\r\nsells at its own price--as much as their Highnesses shall command to be\r\nshipped; lign aloes, as much as their Highnesses shall command to be\r\nshipped; slaves, as many of these idolaters as their Highnesses shall\r\ncommand to be shipped. I think I have also found rhubarb and cinnamon,\r\nand I shall find a thousand other valuable things by means of the men\r\nthat I have left behind me, for I tarried at no point so long as the\r\nwind allowed me to proceed, except in the town of Navidad, where I took\r\nthe necessary precautions for the security and settlement of the men I\r\nhad left there. Much more I would have done if my vessels had been in as\r\ngood a condition as by rights they ought to have been. This is much, and\r\npraised be the eternal God, our Lord, who gives to all those who walk in\r\nhis ways victory over things which seem impossible; of which this is\r\nsignally one, for, although others have spoken or written concerning\r\nthese countries, it was all mere conjecture, as no one could say that he\r\nhad seen them--it amounting only to this, that those who heard listened\r\nthe more, and regarded the matter rather as a fable than anything else.\r\nBut our Redeemer has granted this victory to our illustrious King and\r\nQueen and their kingdoms, which have acquired great fame by an event of\r\nsuch high importance, in which all Christendom ought to rejoice, and\r\nwhich it ought to celebrate with great festivals and the offering of\r\nsolemn thanks to the Holy Trinity with many solemn prayers, both for the\r\ngreat exaltation which may accrue to them in turning so many nations to\r\nour holy faith, and also for the temporal benefits which will bring\r\ngreat refreshment and gain, not only to Spain, but to all Christians.\r\nThis, thus briefly, in accordance with the events._\r\n\r\n_Done on board the caravel, off the Canary Islands, on the fifteenth of\r\nFebruary, fourteen hundred and ninety-three._\r\n\r\n                                           _At your orders,\r\n\r\n                                                THE ADMIRAL._\r\n\r\n_After this letter was written, as I was in the Sea of Castille, there\r\narose a southwest wind, which compelled me to lighten my vessels, and\r\nrun this day into this port of Lisbon, an event which I consider the\r\nmost marvelous thing in the world, and whence I resolved to write to\r\ntheir Highnesses. In all the Indies I have always found the weather like\r\nthat in the month of May. I reached them in thirty-three days, and\r\nreturned in twenty-eight, with the exception that these storms detained\r\nme fourteen days knocking about in this sea.

This\r\nexample was followed by Antonio Doria, Francesco Lomellini, Eliano\r\nSpinola, Ansaldo Grimaldo, and others, as the inscriptions on their\r\nstatues testify.

Our Lord has conferred on me the greatest favor\r\never granted to any one since David. The results of my undertaking\r\nalready appear, and would shine greatly, were they not concealed by the\r\nblindness of the government. I am going again to the Indies under the\r\nauspices of the Holy Trinity, soon to return, and since I am mortal I\r\nleave it with my son Diego that you receive every year, forever,\r\none-tenth of the entire revenue, such as it may be, for the purpose of\r\nreducing the tax upon corn, wine, and other provisions.[26] If that\r\ntenth amounts to something, collect it. If not, take at least the\r\nwill for the deed. I beg of you to entertain regard for the son I have\r\nrecommended to you. Mr. Nicolo de Oderigo knows more about my own\r\naffairs than I do myself, and I have sent him the transcripts of my\r\nprivileges and letters for safe keeping.

If twelve years' hardship and\r\nfatigue; if continual dangers and frequent famine; if the ocean first\r\nopened, and five times passed and repassed, to add a new world,\r\nabounding with wealth, to the Spanish monarchy; and if an infirm and\r\npremature old age, brought on by these services, deserve these chains as\r\na reward, it is very fit I should wear them to Spain, and keep them by\r\nme as memorials to the end of my life._\r\n\r\nFrom a letter to the King and Queen:\r\n\r\n_This country (the Bahamas) excels all others as far as the day\r\nsurpasses the night in splendor; the natives love their neighbors as\r\nthemselves; their conversation is the sweetest imaginable, and their\r\nfaces are always smiling.

We are all therefore at your mercy; but if\r\nyou are men, subject to mortality like ourselves, you can not be\r\nunapprised that after this life there is another, wherein a very\r\ndifferent portion is allotted to good and bad men. If therefore you\r\nexpect to die, and believe, with us, that every one is to be rewarded in\r\na future state according to his conduct in the present, you will do no\r\nhurt to those who do none to you._\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPWRECK AND MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Life of Columbus,\" by his son Hernando:\r\n\r\n_I say, that whilst the Admiral sailed with the aforesaid \"Columbus the\r\nYounger,\" which was a long time, it fell out that, understanding the\r\nbefore-mentioned four great Venetian galleys were coming from Flanders,\r\nthey went out to seek, and found them beyond Lisbon, about Cape St.\r\nVincent, which is in Portugal, where, falling to blows, they fought\r\nfuriously and grappled, beating one another from vessel to vessel with\r\nthe utmost rage, making use not only of their weapons but artificial\r\nfireworks; so that after they had fought from morning until evening, and\r\nabundance were killed on both sides, the Admiral's ship took fire, as\r\ndid a great Venetian galley, which, being fast grappled together with\r\niron hooks and chains used to this purpose by seafaring men, could\r\nneither of them be relieved because of the confusion there was among\r\nthem and the fright of the fire, which in a short time was so increased\r\nthat there was no other remedy but for all that could to leap into the\r\nwater, so to die sooner, rather than bear the torture of the fire._\r\n\r\n_But the Admiral being an excellent swimmer, and seeing himself two\r\nleagues or a little farther from land, laying hold of an oar, which good\r\nfortune offered him, and, sometimes resting upon it, sometimes swimming,\r\nit pleased God, who had preserved him for greater ends, to give him\r\nstrength to get to shore, but so tired and spent with the water that he\r\nhad much ado to recover himself. And because it was not far from Lisbon,\r\nwhere he knew there were many Genoeses, his countrymen, he went away\r\nthither as fast as he could, where, being known by them, he was so\r\ncourteously received and entertained that he set up house and married a\r\nwife in that city. And forasmuch as he behaved himself honorably, and\r\nwas a man of comely presence, and did nothing but what was just, it\r\nhappened that a lady whose name was Dona Felipa Moñiz, of a good family,\r\nand pensioner in the Monastery of All Saints, whither the Admiral used\r\nto go to mass, was so taken with him that she became his wife._\r\n\r\n\r\nPUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN PRINCES.\r\n\r\nFrom a letter of Christopher Columbus to Ferdinand and Isabella:\r\n\r\n_Such is my fate that twenty years of service, through which I passed\r\nwith so much toil and danger, have profited me nothing; and at this day\r\nI do not possess a roof in Spain that I can call my own. If I wish to\r\neat or sleep, I have nowhere to go but to the inn or tavern, and I\r\nseldom have wherewith to pay the bill. I have not a hair upon me that is\r\nnot gray; my body is infirm; and all that was left me, as well as to my\r\nbrothers, has been taken away and sold, even to the frock that I wore,\r\nto my great dishonor. I implore your Highnesses to forgive my\r\ncomplaints. I am indeed in as ruined a condition as I have related.\r\nHitherto I have wept over others; may Heaven now have mercy upon me, and\r\nmay the earth weep for me._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SELF-SACRIFICE AND DEVOTION OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nFrom Columbus' own account of his discovery:\r\n\r\n_Such is my plan; if it be dangerous to execute, I am no mere theorist\r\nwho would leave to another the prospect of perishing in carrying it out,\r\nbut am ready to sacrifice my life as an example to the world in doing\r\nso.

There is, however, a\r\nlist of their names included in one of the diplomatic documents printed\r\non Navarrete's work, which makes the number amount to forty, independent\r\nof the Governor Diego de Arana and his two lieutenants, Pedro Gutierrez\r\nand Rodrigo de Escobedo. All these men were Spaniards, with the\r\nexception of two; one an Irishman named William Ires, a native of\r\nGalway, and one an Englishman, whose name was given as Tallarte de\r\nLajes, but whose native designation it is difficult to guess at. The\r\ndocument in question was a proclamation to the effect that the heirs of\r\nthose men should, on presenting at the office of public business at\r\nSeville sufficient proof of their being the next of kin, receive payment\r\nin conformity with the royal order to that purpose, issued at Burgos on\r\nDecember 20, 1507.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Dominica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Martinique.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Of Genoa.

Hernando Cortez, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa,\r\nPizarro, and others, had to use it officially.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: It is very much to be regretted that Christopher Columbus'\r\nintentions in this respect were not carried out because the Protectors\r\nwould have certainly decreed that a marble statue should be erected to\r\ncommemorate so great a gift, and we would then possess an authentic\r\nportrait of the discoverer of America, which does not exist anywhere.\r\nNor do I believe that the portrait of Columbus ever was drawn, carved,\r\nor painted from the life.\r\n\r\nThere were doubtless painters already in Spain at the close of the\r\nfifteenth century, such, for instance, as Juan Sanchez de Castro, Pedro\r\nBerruguette, Juan de Borgona, Antonio del Rincon, and the five artists\r\nwhom Cardinal Ximenes intrusted with the task of adorning the paranymph\r\nof the University of Alcala, but they painted only religious subjects.\r\nIt is at a later period that portrait painting commenced in Spain. One\r\nof those artists may have thought of painting a portrait of Columbus,\r\nbut there is no trace of any such intention in the writings of the time,\r\nnor of the existence of an authentic effigy of the great navigator in\r\nSpain or any other country.\r\n\r\nWe must recollect that the enthusiasm created by the news of the\r\ndiscovery of America was far from being as great as people now imagine,\r\nand if we may judge from the silence of Spanish poets and historians of\r\nthe fifteenth century, it produced less effect in Spain than anywhere\r\nelse. At all events, the popularity of Columbus lasted scarcely six\r\nmonths, as deceptions commenced with the first letters that were sent\r\nfrom Hispaniola, and they never ceased whilst he was living. In fact, it\r\nis only between April 20, 1493, which is the date of his arrival in\r\nBarcelona, and the 20th of May following, when he left that city to\r\nembark for the second expedition (during the short space of six weeks),\r\nthat his portrait might have been painted; although it was not then a\r\nSpanish notion, by any means. Neither Boabdil nor Gonzalvo de Cordova,\r\nwhose exploits were certainly much more admired by the Spaniards than\r\nthose of Columbus, were honored in that form during their lifetime. Even\r\nthe portraits of Ferdinand and Isabella, although attributed to Antonio\r\ndel Rincon, are only fancy pictures of the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Columbus was short-lived because he led the Spanish\r\nnation to believe that gold was plentiful and easily obtained in Cuba\r\nand Hispaniola, whilst the Spaniards who, seduced by his enthusiastic\r\ndescriptions, crossed the Atlantic in search of wealth, found nothing\r\nbut sufferings and poverty. Those who managed to return home arrived in\r\nSpain absolutely destitute. They were noblemen, who clamored at the\r\ncourt and all over the country, charging \"the stranger\" with having\r\ndeceived them. (Historia de los Reyes Catolicos, cap. lxxxv, f. 188; Las\r\nCasas, lib. i, cap. cxxii, vol. ii, p. 176; Andres Bernaldez, cap.\r\ncxxxi, vol. ii, p. 77.) It was not under such circumstances that\r\nSpaniards would have caused his portrait to be painted. The oldest\r\neffigy of Columbus known (a rough wood-cut in _Jovius_, illustrium\r\nvirorum vitæ, Florentiæ, 1549, folio), was made at least forty years\r\nafter his death, and in Italy, where he never returned after leaving it\r\nas a poor and unknown artizan. Let it be enough for us to know that he\r\nwas above the medium height, robust, with sandy hair, a face elongated,\r\nflushed and freckled, vivid light gray eyes, the nose shaped like the\r\nbeak of an eagle, and that he always was dressed like a monk.\r\n(Bernaldez, Oviedo, Las Casas, and the author of the Libretto, all\r\neye-witnesses.)--H.

This certainly was his reputation. The\r\nnumberless memoirs, petitions, and letters which flew from his pen gave\r\neven rise to jokes and bywords.

Born at Braintree (now Quincy), Norfolk County,\r\n     Mass., October 19, 1735. President, March 4, 1797-March 4, 1801.\r\n     Died at Braintree July 4, 1826.\r\n\r\nI always consider the discovery of America, with reverence and wonder,\r\nas the opening of a grand scene and design in Providence, for the\r\nillumination of the ignorant and the emancipation of the slavish part of\r\nmankind all over the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREATNESS OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM LIVINGSTON ALDEN, an American author. Born in Massachusetts\r\n     October 9, 1837. From his \"Life of Columbus\" (1882), published by\r\n     Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., New York City.\r\n\r\nWhatever flaws there may have been in the man, he was of a finer clay\r\nthan his fellows, for he could dream dreams that their dull imaginations\r\ncould not conceive. He belonged to the same land which gave birth to\r\nGaribaldi, and, like the Great Captain, the Great Admiral lived in a\r\nhigh, pure atmosphere of splendid visions, far removed from and above\r\nhis fellow-men. The greatness of Columbus can not be argued away. The\r\nglow of his enthusiasm kindles our own even at the long distance of four\r\nhundred years, and his heroic figure looms grander through successive\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT ANCHORS.\r\n\r\nTwo anchors that Columbus carried in his ships are exhibited at the\r\nWorld's Fair. The anchors were found by Columbian Commissioner Ober near\r\ntwo old wells at San Salvador. He had photographs and accurate models\r\nmade. These reproductions were sent to Paris, where expert antiquarians\r\npronounced them to be fifteenth century anchors, and undoubtedly those\r\nlost by Columbus in his wreck off San Salvador. One of these has been\r\npresented to the United States and the other is loaned to the Fair.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS AND THE CONVENT OF LA RÁBIDA.\r\n\r\n(ANONYMOUS.)\r\n\r\nIt was at the door of the convent of La Rábida that Columbus,\r\ndisappointed and down-hearted, asked for food and shelter for himself\r\nand his child. It was here that he found an asylum for a few years while\r\nhe developed his plans, and prepared the arguments which he submitted to\r\nthe council at Salamanca. It was in one of the rooms of this convent\r\nthat he met the Dominican monks in debate, and it was here also that he\r\nconferred with Alonzo Pinzon, who afterward commanded one of the vessels\r\nof his fleet. In this convent Columbus lived while he was making\r\npreparations for his voyage, and on the morning that he sailed from\r\nPalos he attended himself the little chapel. There is no building in the\r\nworld so closely identified with his discovery as this.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARNESTNESS OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n(ANONYMOUS.)\r\n\r\nLook at Christopher Columbus. Consider the disheartening difficulties\r\nand vexatious delays he had to encounter; the doubts of the skeptical,\r\nthe sneers of the learned, the cavils of the cautious, and the\r\nopposition, or at least the indifference, of nearly all. And then the\r\ndangers of an untried, unexplored ocean. Is it by any means probable he\r\nwould have persevered had he not possessed that earnest enthusiasm which\r\nwas characteristic of the great discoverer? What mind can conceive or\r\ntongue can tell the great results which have followed, and will continue\r\nto follow in all coming time, from what this single individual\r\naccomplished? A new continent has been discovered; nations planted whose\r\nwealth and power already begin to eclipse those of the Old World, and\r\nwhose empires stretch far away beneath the setting sun. Institutions of\r\nlearning, liberty, and religion have been established on the broad basis\r\nof equal rights to all. It is true, America might have been discovered\r\nby what we call some fortunate accident. But, in all probability, it\r\nwould have remained unknown for centuries, had not some _earnest man_,\r\nlike Columbus, arisen, whose adventurous spirit would be roused, rather\r\nthan repressed, by difficulty and danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nEACH THE COLUMBUS OF HIS OWN SOUL.\r\n\r\n(ANONYMOUS.)\r\n\r\nEvery man has within himself a continent of undiscovered character.\r\nHappy is he who acts the Columbus to his own soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUPERIOR SOUL.\r\n\r\n(CLADERA. SPANISH.)\r\n\r\nHis soul was superior to the age in which he lived. For him was reserved\r\nthe great enterprise of traversing that sea which had given rise to so\r\nmany fables, and of deciphering the mystery of his time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS DARED THE MAIN.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ROGERS. (See _post_, page 275.)\r\n\r\n  When first Columbus dared the Western main,\r\n  Spanned the broad gulf, and gave a world to Spain,\r\n  How thrilled his soul with tumult of delight,\r\n  When through the silence of the sleepless night\r\n  Burst shouts of triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD A SEAMAN'S HAND CONFERRED.\r\n\r\nJ.R.

ANDERSON, American historical writer. Born in New York,\r\n     1821. From his \"History of the United States\" (1887).\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that \"Columbus had to beg his way from court to court to\r\noffer to princes the discovery of a world.\" Genoa was appealed to again,\r\nthen the appeal was made to Venice. Not a word of encouragement came\r\nfrom either. Columbus next tried Spain. His theory was examined by a\r\ncouncil of men who were supposed to be very wise about geography and\r\nnavigation. The theory and its author were ridiculed. Said one of the\r\nwise men: \"Is there any one so foolish as to believe that there are\r\npeople living on the other side of the earth with their feet opposite to\r\nours? people who walk with their heels upward and their heads hanging\r\ndown?\" His idea was that the earth was flat like a plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOGRAPHY OF THE ANCIENTS.\r\n\r\n     From the third of a series of articles by the Hon. ELLIOTT ANTHONY,\r\n     Associate Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chicago, in\r\n     the Chicago _Mail_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF COLUMBUS ON THE BARCELONA MONUMENT.\r\n\r\n(See page 81.)]\r\n\r\nBancroft, the historian, says that nearly three centuries before the\r\nChristian era, Aristotle, following the lessons of the Pythagoreans, had\r\ntaught that the earth is a sphere and that the water which bounds\r\nEurope on the west washes the eastern shores of Asia. Instructed by him,\r\nthe Spaniard, Seneca, believed that a ship, with a fair wind, could sail\r\nfrom Spain to the Indies in a few days. The opinion was revived in the\r\nMiddle Ages by Averroes, the Arab commentator of Aristotle. Science and\r\nobservation assisted to confirm it; and poets of ancient and of more\r\nrecent times had foretold that empires beyond the ocean would one day be\r\nrevealed to the daring navigator. The genial country of Dante and\r\nBuonarotti gave birth to Christopher Columbus, by whom these lessons\r\nwere so received and weighed that he gained the glory of fulfilling the\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\nAccounts of the navigation from the eastern coast of Africa to Arabia\r\nhad reached the western kingdoms of Europe, and adventurous Venetians,\r\nreturning from travels beyond the Ganges, had filled the world with\r\ndazzling descriptions of the wealth of China, as well as marvelous\r\nreports of the outlying island empire of Japan. It began to be believed\r\nthat the continent of Asia stretched over far more than a hemisphere,\r\nand that the remaining distance around the globe was comparatively\r\nshort. Yet from the early part of the fifteenth century the navigators\r\nof Portugal had directed their explorations to the coast of Africa; and\r\nwhen they had ascertained that the torrid zone is habitable, even under\r\nthe equator, the discovery of the islands of Madeira and the Azores\r\ncould not divert them from the purpose of turning the southern capes of\r\nthat continent and steering past them to the land of spices, which\r\npromised untold wealth to the merchants of Europe, new dominions to its\r\nprinces, and heathen nations to the religion of the cross. Before the\r\nyear 1474, and perhaps as early as 1470, Columbus was attracted to\r\nLisbon, which was then the great center of maritime adventure. He came\r\nto insist with immovable resoluteness that the shortest route to the\r\nIndies lay across the Atlantic. By the words of Aristotle, received\r\nthrough Averroes, and by letters from Toscanelli, the venerable\r\ncosmographer of Florence--who had drawn a map of the world, with Eastern\r\nAsia rising over against Europe--he was riveted in his faith and lived\r\nonly in the idea of laying open the western path to the Indies.\r\n\r\nAfter more than ten years of vain solicitations in Portugal, he left the\r\nbanks of the Tagus to seek aid of Ferdinand and Isabella, rich in\r\nnautical experience, having watched the stars at sea from the latitude\r\nof Iceland to near the equator at Elmina. Though yet longer baffled by\r\nthe skepticism which knew not how to comprehend the clearness of his\r\nconception, or the mystic trances which sustained his inflexibility of\r\npurpose, or the unfailing greatness of his soul, he lost nothing of his\r\ndevotedness to the sublime office to which he held himself elected from\r\nhis infancy by the promises of God. When, half resolved to withdraw from\r\nSpain, traveling on foot, he knocked at the gate of the monastery of La\r\nRábida, at Palos, to crave the needed charity of food and shelter for\r\nhimself and his little son, whom he led by the hand, the destitute and\r\nneglected seaman, in his naked poverty, was still the promiser of\r\nkingdoms, holding firmly in his grasp \"the key of the ocean sea;\"\r\nclaiming, as it were from Heaven, the Indies as his own, and \"dividing\r\nthem as he pleased.\" It was then that through the prior of the convent\r\nhis holy confidence found support in Isabella, the Queen of Castille;\r\nand in 1492, with three poor vessels, of which the largest only was\r\ndecked, embarking from Palos for the Indies by way of the west, Columbus\r\ngave a new world to Castille and Leon, \"the like of which was never done\r\nby any man in ancient or in later times.\"\r\n\r\nThe jubilee of this great discovery is at hand, and now after the lapse\r\nof 400 years, as we look back over the vast ranges of human history,\r\nthere is nothing in the order of Providence which can compare in\r\ninterest with the condition of the American continent as it lay upon the\r\nsurface of the globe, a hemisphere unknown to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThere stretched the iron chain of its mountain barriers, not yet the\r\nboundary of political communities; there rolled its mighty rivers\r\nunprofitably to the sea; there spread out the measureless, but as yet\r\nwasteful, fertility of its uncultivated fields; there towered the gloomy\r\nmajesty of its unsubdued primeval forests; there glittered in the secret\r\ncaves of the earth the priceless treasures of its unsunned gold, and,\r\nmore than all that pertains to material wealth, there existed the\r\nundeveloped capacity of 100 embryo states of an imperial confederacy of\r\nrepublics, the future abode of intelligent millions, unrevealed as yet\r\nto the \"earnest\" but unconscious \"expectation\" of the elder families of\r\nman, darkly hidden by the impenetrable veil of waters. There is, to my\r\nmind, says Everett, an overwhelming sadness in this long insulation of\r\nAmerica from the brotherhood of humanity, not inappropriately reflected\r\nin the melancholy expression of the native races.\r\n\r\nThe boldest keels of Phoenicia and Carthage had not approached its\r\nshores. From the footsteps of the ancient nations along the highways of\r\ntime and fortune--the embattled millions of the old Asiatic despotisms,\r\nthe iron phalanx of Macedonia, the living, crushing machinery of the\r\nRoman legion which ground the world to powder, the heavy tramp of\r\nbarbarous nations from \"the populous north\"--not the faintest echo had\r\naroused the slumbering West in the cradle of her existence. Not a thrill\r\nof sympathy had shot across the Atlantic from the heroic adventure, the\r\nintellectual and artistic vitality, the convulsive struggles for\r\nfreedom, the calamitous downfalls of empire, and the strange new\r\nregenerations which fill the pages of ancient and mediæval history.\r\nAlike when the oriental myriads, Assyrian, Chaldean, Median, Persian,\r\nBactrian, from the snows of Syria to the Gulf of Ormus, from the Halys\r\nto the Indus, poured like a deluge upon Greece and beat themselves to\r\nidle foam on the sea-girt rock of Salamis and the lowly plain of\r\nMarathon; when all the kingdoms of the earth went down with her own\r\nliberties in Rome's imperial maëlstrom of blood and fire, and when the\r\nbanded powers of the west, beneath the ensign of the cross, as the\r\npendulum of conquest swung backward, marched in scarcely intermitted\r\nprocession for three centuries to the subjugation of Palestine, the\r\nAmerican continent lay undiscovered, lonely and waste. That mighty\r\naction and reaction upon each other of Europe and America, the grand\r\nsystole and diastole of the heart of nations, and which now constitutes\r\nso much of the organized life of both, had not yet begun to pulsate.\r\n\r\nThe unconscious child and heir of the ages lay wrapped in the mantle of\r\nfuturity upon the broad and nurturing bosom of divine Providence, and\r\nslumbered serenely like the infant Danae through the storms of fifty\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DARK AGES BEFORE COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     From the writings of SAINT AUGUSTINE, the most noted of the Latin\r\n     fathers. Born at Tagasta, Numidia, November 13, A. D. 354; died at\r\n     Hippo, August 28, A. D. 430. (This passage was relied on by the\r\n     ecclesiastical opponents of Columbus to show the heterodoxy of his\r\n     project.)\r\n\r\nThey do not see that even if the earth were round it would not follow\r\nthat the part directly opposite is not covered with water. Besides,\r\nsupposing it not to be so, what necessity is there that it should be\r\ninhabited, since the Scriptures, in the first place, the fulfilled\r\nprophecies of which attest the truth thereof for the past, can not be\r\nsuspected of telling tales; and, in the second place, it is really too\r\nabsurd to say that men could ever cross such an immense ocean to implant\r\nin those parts a sprig of the family of the first man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     JOANNA BAILLIE, a noted Scottish poetess. Born at Bothwell,\r\n     Scotland, 1762; died at Hampstead, near London, February 23, 1851.\r\n     From \"The Legend of Columbus.\"\r\n\r\n  Is there a man that, from some lofty steep,\r\n  Views in his wide survey the boundless deep,\r\n  When its vast waters, lined with sun and shade,\r\n  Wave beyond wave, in serried distance, fade?\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS THE CONQUEROR.\r\n\r\n  No kingly conqueror, since time began\r\n  The long career of ages, hath to man\r\n  A scope so ample given for trade's bold range\r\n  Or caused on earth's wide stage such rapid, mighty change.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMPLE OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n  Some ardent youth, perhaps, ere from his home\r\n  He launch his venturous bark, will hither come,\r\n  Read fondly o'er and o'er his graven name,\r\n  With feelings keenly touched, with heart aflame;\r\n  Till, wrapped in fancy's wild delusive dream,\r\n  Times past and long forgotten, present seem.\r\n  To his charmed ear the east wind, rising shrill,\r\n  Seems through the hero's shroud to whistle still.\r\n  The clock's deep pendulum swinging through the blast\r\n  Sounds like the rocking of his lofty mast;\r\n  While fitful gusts rave like his clam'rous band,\r\n  Mixed with the accents of his high command.\r\n  Slowly the stripling quits the pensive scene,\r\n  And burns and sighs and weeps to be what he has been.\r\n\r\n  Oh, who shall lightly say that fame\r\n  Is nothing but an empty name?\r\n  Whilst in that sound there is a charm\r\n  The nerves to brace, the heart to warm,\r\n  As, thinking of the mighty dead,\r\n    The young from slothful couch will start,\r\n  And vow, with lifted hands outspread,\r\n    Like them to act a noble part.\r\n\r\n  Oh, who shall lightly say that fame\r\n  Is nothing but an empty name?\r\n  When but for those, our mighty dead,\r\n    All ages past a blank would be,\r\n  Sunk in oblivion's murky bed,\r\n    A desert bare, a shipless sea!\r\n  They are the distant objects seen,\r\n  The lofty marks of what hath been.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nPALOS--THE DEPARTURE.\r\n\r\n  On Palos' shore, whose crowded strand\r\n  Bore priests and nobles of the land,\r\n  And rustic hinds and townsmen trim,\r\n  And harnessed soldiers stern and grim,\r\n  And lowly maids and dames of pride,\r\n  And infants by their mother's side--\r\n  The boldest seaman stood that e'er\r\n  Did bark or ship through tempest steer;\r\n  And wise as bold, and good as wise;\r\n  The magnet of a thousand eyes,\r\n    That on his form and features cast,\r\n  His noble mien and simple guise,\r\n    In wonder seemed to look their last.\r\n  A form which conscious worth is gracing,\r\n  A face where hope, the lines effacing\r\n    Of thought and care, bestowed, in truth,\r\n  To the quick eyes' imperfect tracing\r\n    The look and air of youth.\r\n\r\n   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The signal given, with hasty strides\r\n  The sailors line their ships' dark sides,\r\n  Their anchors weighed, and from the shore\r\n  Each stately vessel slowly bore.\r\n  High o'er the deep and shadowed flood,\r\n  Upon his deck their leader stood,\r\n  And turned him to departed land,\r\n  And bowed his head and waved his hand.\r\n  And then, along the crowded strand,\r\n  A sound of many sounds combined,\r\n  That waxed and waved upon the wind,\r\n  Burst like heaven's thunder, deep and grand;\r\n  A lengthened peal, which paused, and then\r\n    Renewed, like that which loathly parts,\r\n  Oft on the ear returned again,\r\n    The impulse of a thousand hearts.\r\n  But as the lengthened shouts subside,\r\n    Distincter accents strike the ear,\r\n  Wafting across the current wide\r\n    Heart-uttered words of parting cheer:\r\n  \"Oh, shall we ever see again\r\n  Those gallant souls across the main?\r\n  God keep the brave!

Compiler of \"Pearls of\r\n     Thought\" and similar works. Born in Boston, Mass., April 14, 1822.\r\n     From \"Due South,\" published by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston,\r\n     1887.\r\n\r\nThe name of Columbus flashes a bright ray over the mental darkness of\r\nthe period in which he lived, for the world was then but just awakening\r\nfrom the dull sleep of the Middle Ages. The discovery of printing\r\nheralded the new birth of the republic of letters, and maritime\r\nenterprise received a vigorous impulse. The shores of the Mediterranean,\r\nthoroughly explored and developed, had endowed the Italian states with\r\nextraordinary wealth, and built up a very respectable mercantile marine.\r\nThe Portuguese mariners were venturing farther and farther from the\r\npeninsula, and traded with many distant ports on the extended coast of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nTo the west lay what men supposed to be an illimitable ocean, full of\r\nmystery, peril, and death. A vague conception that islands hitherto\r\nunknown might be met afar off on that strange wilderness of waters was\r\nentertained by some minds, but no one thought of venturing in search of\r\nthem. Columbus alone, regarded merely as a brave and intelligent seaman\r\nand pilot, conceived the idea that the earth was spherical, and that the\r\nEast Indies, the great El Dorado of the century, might be reached by\r\ncircumnavigating the globe. If we picture to ourselves the mental\r\ncondition of the age and the state of science, we shall find no\r\ndifficulty in conceiving the scorn and incredulity with which the theory\r\nof Columbus was received. We shall not wonder that he was regarded as a\r\nmadman or a fool; we are not surprised to remember that he encountered\r\nrepulse upon repulse as he journeyed wearily from court to court, and\r\npleaded in vain to the sovereigns of Europe for aid to prosecute his\r\ngreat design. The marvel is that when door after door was closed against\r\nhim, when all ears were deaf to his earnest importunities, when day by\r\nday the opposition to his views increased, when, weary and footsore, he\r\nwas forced to beg a bit of bread and a cup of water for his fainting and\r\nfamishing boy at the door of a Spanish convent, his reason did not give\r\nway, and his great heart did not break with disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST AMERICAN MONUMENT TO COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     From an article in the Baltimore _American_.\r\n\r\nTo a patriotic Frenchman and to Baltimore belongs the credit of the\r\nerection of the first monument to the memory of Christopher Columbus.\r\nThis shaft, though unpretentious in height and material, is the first\r\never erected in the \"Monumental City\" or in the whole United States. The\r\nmonument was put up on his estate by Charles Francis Adrian le Paulmier,\r\nChevalier d'Amour. The property is now occupied by the Samuel Ready\r\nOrphan Asylum, at North and Hartford avenues. It passed into the hands\r\nof the trustees from the executors of the late Zenus Barnum's will.\r\n\r\nIt has ever been a matter of surprise, particularly among tourists, that\r\namong the thousand and one monuments which have been put up in the\r\nUnited States to the illustrious dead, that the daring navigator who\r\nfirst sighted an island which was part of a great continent which 400\r\nyears later developed into the first nation of the world, should be so\r\ncompletely and entirely overlooked. It is on record that the only other\r\nmonument in the world, up to 1863, which has been erected in the honor\r\nof Columbus is in Genoa. There is no authoritative account of the\r\nconstruction of the Baltimore monument. The fact that it was built in\r\nhonor of Columbus is substantial, as the following inscription on the\r\nshaft shows:\r\n\r\n  Sacred\r\n  to the\r\n  Memory\r\n  of\r\n  CHRIS.\r\n  COLUMBUS,\r\n  OCT. XII,\r\n  MDCC VIIIC.\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that the numerals are engrossed in the old English style,\r\nand show eight less than 1800, or 1792, and the date October 12th. The\r\nshaft towers among the boughs of a great oak tree which, like itself,\r\nhas stood the storms and winds of nearly a hundred years. It has seen\r\nBaltimore develop from a little colonial town to a great city. The\r\nexistence of the monument, strange to say, was known to only a few\r\npersons until the opening of North Avenue through the Barnum estate\r\nabout twelve years ago. It looms up about fifty feet, and is attractive.\r\nTradition says that it is built of brick which was brought from England,\r\nand covered with mortar or cement. At any rate it is substantial, and\r\nlikely to stand the ravages of time for many more years. The Samuel\r\nReady estate is on the east side of the Hartford turnpike and fronts on\r\nNorth Avenue. The old-fashioned country house, which was built many\r\nyears ago, was occupied by the proprietor of Baltimore's famous\r\nhostelry, and is still in use. It is occupied by girls who are reared\r\nand educated by money left by the philanthropist Samuel Ready. Forty or\r\nfifty years ago the elder David Barnum resided there.\r\n\r\nIn the southeast corner of the beautiful inclosure stands the monument.\r\nIt is on an elevated terraced plateau. The plaster or cement coating is\r\nintact, and the inscription is plain. The shaft is quadrangular in form,\r\nsloping from a base six feet six inches in diameter to about two feet\r\nand a half at the top, which is a trifle over fifty feet from the\r\nground. The pedestal comprises a base about thirty inches high, with\r\nwell-rounded corners of molded brick work. The pedestal proper is five\r\nfeet six inches in diameter, ten feet in height, and a cornice,\r\nornamental in style, about three feet in height. From this rises a\r\ntapering shaft of about twenty-eight feet. The whole is surmounted by a\r\ncapstone eighteen inches high. Three stories are told about the\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nHere is the first: Among the humble people who have lived in that\r\nsection for years the legend is that the monument was erected to the\r\nmemory of a favorite horse owned by the old Frenchman who was the first\r\nFrench consul to the United States. For years it was known as the \"Horse\r\nMonument,\" and people with imaginative brains conjured up all sorts of\r\ntales, and retailed them _ad lib_. These stories were generally accepted\r\nwithout much inquiry as to their authenticity.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is the true story: Gen. D'Amour, who was the first\r\nrepresentative sent to the colonies from France, was extremely wealthy.\r\nHe was a member of a society founded to perpetuate the memory of\r\nColumbus in his own land.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Gen. D'Amour came to America with Count de Grasse, and\r\nafter the fall of Yorktown retired to this city, where he remained until\r\nhe was recalled to France in 1797. His reason for erecting the monument\r\nwas because of his admiration for Columbus' bravery in the face of\r\napparent failure. Tradition further says that one evening in the year\r\n1792, while he was entertaining a party of guests, the fact that it was\r\nthen the tri-centennial of the discovery of America was the topic of\r\nconversation. During the evening it was mentioned incidentally that\r\nthere was not in this whole country a monument to commemorate the deeds\r\nof Columbus. Thereupon, Gen. D'Amour is said to have made a solemn vow\r\nthat this neglect should be immediately remedied by the erection of an\r\nenduring shaft upon his own estate.\r\n\r\nHe bought the property around where the monument now stands, and lived\r\nin grand style, as befitted a man of his wealth and position. He\r\nentertained extensively. It is said that Lafayette was dined and fêted\r\nby the Frenchman in the old brick house which is still standing behind\r\nthe mansion. In the year and on the date which marked the 300th\r\nanniversary of the discovery of America the monument was unveiled. The\r\nnewspapers in those days were not enterprising, and the journals\r\npublished at that time do not mention the fact. Again, it is said that\r\nD'Amour died at the old mansion, and many people believe that his body\r\nwas interred near the base of the shaft. It is related that about forty\r\nyears ago two Frenchmen came to this country and laid claims on the\r\nproperty, which had, after the Frenchman's death, passed into other\r\nhands. The claim was disputed because of an unsettled mortgage on it,\r\nand they failed to prove their title. They tried to discover the\r\nburial-place of the former owner. In this they also failed, although\r\nlarge rewards were offered to encourage people to aid them in their\r\nsearch. It is said that an ingenious Irishman in the neighborhood\r\nundertook to earn the reward, and pointed out a grave in an old Quaker\r\nburying-ground close by.\r\n\r\nThe grave was opened and the remains exhumed. Examination proved the\r\nbones those of a colored man. Old Mrs. Reilly, who was the wife of\r\nfamous old Barnum's Hotel hackman Reilly, used to say that some years\r\nafter the two Frenchmen had departed there came another mysterious\r\nFrenchman, who sat beside the monument for weeks, pleading to the then\r\nowners for permission to dig in a certain spot hard by. He was refused.\r\nNothing daunted, he waited an opportunity and, when the coast was clear,\r\nhe dug up a stone slab, which he had heard was to be found, and carried\r\naway the remains of a pet cat which had been buried there.\r\n\r\nFrequent inquiries were made of Mr. Samuel H. Tagart, who was the\r\ntrustee in charge of the estate of Zenus Barnum, in regard to the old\r\nFrenchman. Antiquarians all over the country made application for\r\npermission to dig beneath the monument, and to remove the tablet from\r\nthe face of the shaft. He felt, however, that he could not do it, and\r\nrefused all requests.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present century the Samuel Ready estate was owned by Thomas\r\nTenant--in those days a wealthy, influential citizen. One of his\r\ndaughters, now dead, became the wife of Hon. John P. Kennedy. Another\r\ndaughter, who lived in New York, and who is supposed to be dead, paid a\r\nvisit in 1878 to the old homestead, and sat beneath the shadow of the\r\nColumbus monument. She stated that the shaft has stood in her early\r\ngirlhood as it stands now. It was often visited by noted Italians and\r\nFrenchmen, who seemed to have heard of the existence of the monument in\r\nEurope. She repeated the story of the wealthy Frenchman, and told of\r\nsome of his eccentricities, and said he had put up the monument at a\r\ncost of £800, or $4,000.\r\n\r\nThe old land records of Baltimore town were examined by a representative\r\nof the _American_ as far back as 1787. It appears that in that year\r\nDaniel Weatherly and his wife, Elizabeth; Samuel Wilson and wife,\r\nHannah; Isaac Pennington and Jemima, his wife, and William Askew and\r\nJonathan Rutter assigned to Rachel Stevenson four lots of ground,\r\ncomprising the estate known as \"Hanson's Woods,\" \"Darley Hall,\"\r\n\"Rutter's Discovery,\" and \"Orange.\" Later, in 1787 and 1788, additional\r\nlots were received from one Christopher Hughes, and in the following\r\nyear the entire estate was assigned by Rachel Stevenson to Charles\r\nFrancis Adrian le Paulmier, Chevalier d'Amour, the French consul, the\r\neccentric Frenchman, and the perpetuator of Columbus' memory in\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nThe property remained in his possession up to 1796, when Archibald\r\nCampbell purchased it. In the year 1800 James Hindman bought it, and\r\nretained possession until 1802, when James Carere took hold. Thomas\r\nTenant purchased the estate in 1809. At his death, in 1830, it changed\r\nhands several times, and was finally bought by David Barnum, about 1833.\r\nAt his death, in 1854, the estate passed into the hands of Samuel W.\r\nMcClellan, then to Zenus Barnum, and subsequently fell to his heirs, Dr.\r\nZenus Barnum, Arthur C. Barnum, Annie and Maggie Barnum. After much\r\nlitigation, about four years ago the estate passed into possession of\r\nthe executors of Samuel Ready's will, and they have turned the once\r\ntumbled-down, deserted place into a beautiful spot. All the families\r\nmentioned have relatives living in this city now. In all the changes of\r\ntime and owners, the monument to Columbus has remained intact, showing\r\nthat it is always the fittest that survives, and that old things are\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nMr. E. G. Perine, one of the officers of the Samuel Ready Orphan Asylum,\r\nhas collected most of the data relating to the monument.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN STATUE.\r\n\r\nThe Italian citizens resident in Baltimore propose to donate a\r\nmagnificent statue of Columbus to the \"Monumental City,\" in\r\ncommemoration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS--THE FULFILLER OF PROPHECY.\r\n\r\n     GEORGE BANCROFT, Ph.D., LL.D., D.C.L., America's premier historian.\r\n     Born at Worcester, Mass. October 3, 1800; died January 17, 1891.\r\n     From \"The History of the United States.\"[28]\r\n\r\nImagination had conceived the idea that vast inhabited regions lay\r\nunexplored in the west; and poets had declared that empires beyond the\r\nocean would one day be revealed to the daring navigator. But Columbus\r\ndeserves the undivided glory of having realized that belief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe writers of to-day are disposed to consider Magellan's voyage a\r\ngreater feat than that of Columbus. I can not agree with them. Magellan\r\nwas doubtless a remarkable man, and a very bold man. But when he crossed\r\nthe Pacific Ocean he _knew_ he must come to land at last; whereas\r\nColumbus, whatever he may have heard concerning lands to the west, or\r\nwhatever his theories may have led him to expect, must still have been\r\nin a state of uncertainty--to say nothing of the superstitious fears of\r\nhis companions, and probably his own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of Columbus, the most memorable maritime enterprise in\r\nthe history of the world, formed between Europe and America the\r\ncommunication which will never cease. The story of the colonization of\r\nAmerica by Northmen rests on narratives mythological in form and obscure\r\nin meaning; ancient, yet not contemporary. The intrepid mariners who\r\ncolonized Greenland could easily have extended their voyages to Labrador\r\nand have explored the coasts to the south of it. No clear historic\r\nevidence establishes the natural probability that they accomplished the\r\npassage; and no vestige of their presence on our continent has been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nNearly three centuries before the Christian era, Aristotle, following\r\nthe lessons of the Pythagoreans, had taught that the earth is a sphere,\r\nand that the water which bounds Europe on the west washes the eastern\r\nshores of Asia. Instructed by him, the Spaniard Seneca believed that a\r\nship, with a fair wind, could sail from Spain to the Indies in the space\r\nof a very few days. The opinion was revived in the Middle Ages by\r\nAverroes, the Arab commentator of Aristotle; science and observation\r\nassisted to confirm it; and poets of ancient and of more recent times\r\nhad foretold that empires beyond the ocean would one day be revealed to\r\nthe daring navigator. The genial country of Dante and Buonarotti gave\r\nbirth to Christopher Columbus, by whom these lessons were so received\r\nand weighed that he gained the glory of fulfilling the prophecy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS THE MARINER.\r\n\r\n     HUBERT HOWE BANCROFT, an American historian. Born at Granville,\r\n     Ohio, 1832.\r\n\r\nAs a mariner and discoverer Columbus had no superior; as a colonist and\r\ngovernor he proved himself a failure. Had he been less pretentious and\r\ngrasping, his latter days would have been more peaceful. Discovery was\r\nhis infatuation; but he lacked practical judgment, and he brought upon\r\nhimself a series of calamities.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COLUMBUS BANK NOTE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMBUS MONUMENT, PASEO COLON, BARCELONA, SPAIN.\r\n\r\nDedicated May 2, 1888]\r\n\r\nSince the Postoffice Department has decided to issue a set of stamps in\r\nhonor of Columbus, it has been suggested that a Columbus bank note would\r\nalso be in good taste at this time. Chief Meredith, of the Bureau of\r\nEngraving and Printing, originated the latter idea and will lay it\r\nbefore Secretary Foster when he returns to his desk at the Treasury.\r\nIssuing a whole set of Columbian notes would involve not only a great\r\ndeal of preparation but cost as well, and hence it is proposed to choose\r\none of the smaller denominations, probably the $1 note, for the change.\r\nThere is an engraving of Columbus in the bureau made by Burt, who was\r\nconsidered the finest vignette engraver in the country. It is a\r\nfull-face portrait, representing Columbus with a smooth face and wearing\r\na brigandish-looking hat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARCELONA STATUE.\r\n\r\nThe historic Muralla del Mar (sea wall) of Barcelona has been effaced\r\nduring the progress of harbor improvements, and its place supplied by a\r\nwide and handsome quay, which forms a delightful promenade, is planted\r\nwith palms, and has been officially named the Paseo de Colon (Columbus\r\nPromenade). Here, at the foot of the Rambla in the Plaza de la Paz, is a\r\nmarble statue of Columbus.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent monument, erected in honor of the great Genoese\r\nmariner, was unveiled on May 2, 1888, in the presence of the Queen\r\nRegent, King Alfonzo XIII. of Spain, and the royal family; Señor\r\nSagasta, President of the Council of Ministers, the chief Alcalde of\r\nBarcelona, many other Spanish notables, and the officers of the many\r\nEuropean and American men-of-war then in the port of Barcelona.\r\n\r\nIt was dedicated amid the thunders of more than 5,000 guns and the\r\nsalutes of battalions of brave seamen. The ceremony was such and so\r\nimposing as to be without a parallel in the history of any other part of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe following ships of war, at anchor in the harbor of Barcelona, boomed\r\nout their homage to the First Admiral of the Shadowy Sea, and, landing\r\ndetachments of officers, seamen, and marines, took part in the\r\ninauguration ceremonies.\r\n\r\n_American_--United States steamship Winnebago.\r\n\r\n_Austrian_--The imperial steamships Tegethoff, Custozz, Prinz Eugen,\r\nKaiser Max, Kaiser John of Austria, Meteor, Panther, and Leopard.\r\n\r\n_British_--H.M.S.

Wohlgemuth, engineer and\r\nconstructor of Barcelona, and was made in eight pieces, the base\r\nweighing 31-1/2 tons. The first section, 22-1/2 tons; the second, 24-1/2\r\ntons; the third, 23-1/2 tons; the fourth, 23-1/8 tons; the capital,\r\n29-1/2 tons; the templete, 13-1/2 tons; the globe, 15-1/2 tons; the\r\nbronze ornaments, 13-1/2 tons; the statue of Columbus, 41 tons; the\r\npedestal of the column, 31-1/2 tons; the total weight of bronze employed\r\nin the column being 210-1/2 tons; its height, 198 feet.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of the monument amounted to 1,000,000 pesetas. Of these,\r\n350,000 were collected by public subscription, and the remaining 650,000\r\npesetas were contributed by the city of Barcelona.\r\n\r\nThe monument is 198 feet in height, and is ascended by means of an\r\nhydraulic elevator; five or six persons have room to stand on the\r\nplatform. On the side facing the sea there opens a staircase of a single\r\nflight, which leads to a small resting room richly ornamented, and lit\r\nby a skylight, which contains the elevator. The grand and beautiful city\r\nof Barcelona, the busiest center of industry, commerce, and shipping,\r\nand mart of the arts and sciences, is not likely to leave in oblivion he\r\nwho enriched the Old World with a new one, opening new arteries of trade\r\nwhich immensely augmented its renowned commercial existence; and less is\r\nit likely to forget that the citizens of Barcelona who were\r\ncontemporaneous with Columbus were among the first to greet the unknown\r\nmariner when he returned from America, for the first time, with the\r\nenthusiasm which his colossal discovery evoked.\r\n\r\nIf for this alone, in one of her most charming squares, in full view of\r\nthe ocean whose bounds the immortal sailor fixed and discovered, they\r\nhave raised his statue upon a monument higher than the most celebrated\r\nones of the earth. This statue, constructed under the supervision of the\r\nartist Don Cayetano Buigas, is composed of a base one meter in height\r\nand twenty meters wide, and of three sections. The first part is a\r\ncircular section, eighteen meters in diameter, ten feet in height; it is\r\ncomposed of carved stone with interspersed bas-reliefs in bronze,\r\nrepresenting episodes in the life of Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe second story takes the form of a cross, and is of the height of\r\nthirty-three feet, being of carved stone decorated with bronzes. On the\r\narms of the cross are four female figures, representing Catalonia,\r\nAragon, Castille, and Leon, and in the angles of the same are figures of\r\nFather Boyle, Santangel, Margarite and Ferrer de Blanes.\r\n\r\nOn the sides of the cross are grouped eight medallions of bronze, on\r\nwhich are placed the busts of Isabella I., Ferdinand V., Father Juan\r\nFlores, Andrés de Cabrera, Padre Juan de la Marchena, the Marchioness of\r\nMoya, Martin Pinzon, and his brother, Vicente Yañez Pinzon.\r\n\r\nThis section upholds the third part of the monument, which takes the\r\nform of an immense globe, on top of which stands the statue of Columbus,\r\na noble conception of a great artist, grandly pointing toward the\r\nconquered confines of the Mysterious Sea.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGEND OF A WESTERN LAND.\r\n\r\n     Rev. SABINE BARING-GOULD, vicar of Looe Trenchard, Devonshire,\r\n     England. Born at Exeter, England, 1834. An antiquarian,\r\n     archæological and historical writer, no mean poet, and a novelist.\r\n     From his \"Curious Myths of the Middle Ages.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to a Keltic legend, in former days there lived in Skerr a\r\nDruid of renown. He sat with his face to the west on the shore, his eye\r\nfollowing the declining sun, and he blamed the careless billows which\r\ntumbled between him and the distant Isle of Green. One day, as he sat\r\nmusing on a rock, a storm arose on the sea; a cloud, under whose squally\r\nskirts the foaming waters tossed, rushed suddenly into the bay, and from\r\nits dark womb emerged a boat with white sails bent to the wind and banks\r\nof gleaming oars on either side. But it was destitute of mariners,\r\nitself seeming to live and move. An unusual terror seized on the aged\r\nDruid; he heard a voice call, \"Arise, and see the Green Isle of those\r\nwho have passed away!\" Then he entered the vessel. Immediately the wind\r\nshifted, the cloud enveloped him, and in the bosom of the vapor he\r\nsailed away. Seven days gleamed on him through the mist; on the eighth,\r\nthe waves rolled violently, the vessel pitched, and darkness thickened\r\naround him, when suddenly he heard a cry, \"The Isle! the Isle!\" The\r\nclouds parted before him, the waves abated, the wind died away, and the\r\nvessel rushed into dazzling light. Before his eyes lay the Isle of the\r\nDeparted, basking in golden light. Its hills sloped green and tufted\r\nwith beauteous trees to the shore, the mountain tops were enveloped in\r\nbright and transparent clouds, from which gushed limpid streams, which,\r\nwandering down the steep hill-sides with pleasant harp-like murmur\r\nemptied themselves into the twinkling blue bays. The valleys were open\r\nand free to the ocean; trees loaded with leaves, which scarcely waved to\r\nthe light breeze, were scattered on the green declivities and rising\r\nground; all was calm and bright; the pure sun of autumn shone from his\r\nblue sky on the fields; he hastened not to the west for repose, nor was\r\nhe seen to rise in the east, but hung as a golden lamp, ever illumining\r\nthe Fortunate Isles.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGEND OF A WESTERN ISLAND.\r\n\r\nThere is a Phoenician legend that a large island was discovered in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, several days' sail from\r\nthe coast of Africa. This island abounded in all manner of riches. The\r\nsoil was exceedingly fertile; the scenery was diversified by rivers,\r\nmountains, and forests. It was the custom of the inhabitants to retire\r\nduring the summer to magnificent country houses, which stood in the\r\nmidst of beautiful gardens. Fish and game were found in great abundance,\r\nthe climate was delicious, and the trees bore fruit at all seasons of\r\nthe year.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS AN IDEAL COMMANDER.\r\n\r\n     JOEL BARLOW, American poet, patriot, and politician.

The dignity and affability of his\r\nmanners, his surprising knowledge and experience in naval affairs, his\r\nunwearied and minute attention to the duties of his command, gave him a\r\ngreat ascendancy over the minds of his men, and inspired that degree of\r\nconfidence which would have maintained his authority in almost any\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN'S INGRATITUDE.\r\n\r\n  Long had the sage, the first who dared to brave\r\n  The unknown dangers of the western wave;\r\n  Who taught mankind where future empires lay\r\n  In these confines of descending day;\r\n  With cares o'erwhelmed, in life's distressing gloom,\r\n  Wish'd from a thankless world a peaceful tomb,\r\n  While kings and nations, envious of his name,\r\n  Enjoyed his toils and triumphed o'er his fame,\r\n  And gave the chief, from promised empire hurl'd,\r\n  Chains for a crown, a prison for a world.\r\n\r\n  --_Barlow_, \"Columbus\" (1787).\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: By permission of Messrs.

J., contributes an interesting historical relic to\r\nthe World's Fair. It is the bell that has for years called them to\r\nchurch. In the year 1445, the bell, it is said, hung in one of the\r\ntowers of the famous mosque at the Alhambra. After the siege of Granada,\r\nthe bell was taken away by the Spanish soldiers and presented to Queen\r\nIsabella, who, in turn, presented it to Columbus, who brought it to\r\nAmerica on his fourth voyage and presented it to a community of Spanish\r\nmonks who placed it in the Cathedral of Carthagena, on the Island of New\r\nGranada. In 1697 buccaneers looted Carthagena, and carried the bell on\r\nboard the French pirate ship La Rochelle, but the ship was wrecked on\r\nthe Island of St. Andreas shortly afterward, and the wreckers secured\r\nthe bell as part of their salvage. Capt. Newell of Bridgeton purchased\r\nit, brought it to this country, and presented it to the colored\r\ncongregation of the Haleyville church. The bell weighs sixty-four\r\npounds, and is of fine metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     GERONIMO BENZONI of Milan, Italy. Born about 1520. From his\r\n     \"History of the New World\" (1565).\r\n\r\nHe was a man of a good, reasonable stature, with sound, strong limbs; of\r\ngood judgment, high talent, and gentlemanlike aspect. His eyes were\r\nbright, his hair red, his nose aquiline, his mouth somewhat large; but\r\nabove all he was a friend to justice, though rather passionate when\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTWARD RELIGION'S BANNERS TOOK THEIR WAY.\r\n\r\n     The Right Rev.

He was not premature;\r\nhe was not late. He came in accordance with a scientifically formed if\r\nimperfect theory, whether his own or another's--a theory which had a\r\nlogical foundation, and which projected logical sequences. * * * Had not\r\nColumbus discovered America in 1492, a hundred Columbuses would have\r\ndiscovered it in 1493.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CERTAIN CONVICTIONS OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     BARON BONNAFOUX, a French author.

He considered himself, on\r\nprinciple, above envy and slander, and in calm and serious discussion\r\nalways had the superiority in argument on the subjects of his schemes.\r\nTo refuse to assist him in his projects was one thing; but it was\r\nimpossible to reply to his discourse in refutation of his arguments,\r\nand, above all, not to respect him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMBUS OF MODERN TIMES.\r\n\r\n     From an editorial in the Boston _Journal_, July 13, 1892.\r\n\r\nWhen John Bright, in Parliament, shortly after the successful laying of\r\nthe Atlantic cable, called Cyrus W. Field _the Columbus of modern\r\ntimes_, he made no inappropriate comparison. Mr. Field, in the early\r\ndays of the great undertaking that has made his name immortal, had to\r\ncontend against the same difficulties as the intrepid Genoese. The\r\nlineal descendants of the fifteenth century pundits, who vexed the soul\r\nof Columbus by insisting that the world was flat, were very sure that a\r\ncable could never be laid across the boisterous Atlantic; that sea\r\nmonsters would bite it off and huge waves destroy it. Both men finally\r\nprevailed over a doubting world by sheer force of indomitable\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nMany men in Mr. Field's place, having amassed a fortune comparatively\r\nearly in life, would have devoted themselves to ease and recreation. But\r\nthere was too much of the New England spirit of restless energy in Mr.\r\nField to permit him to pass the best years of his life thus\r\ningloriously. The great thought of his cable occurred to him, and he\r\nbecame a man of one fixed idea, and ended by becoming a popular hero. No\r\nprivate American citizen, probably, has received such distinguished\r\nhonors as Mr. Field when his cable was laid in 1867, and the undertaking\r\nof his lifetime was successfully accomplished. And Mr. Field was\r\nhonestly entitled to all the glory and to all the financial profit that\r\nhe reaped. His project was one that only a giant mind could conceive,\r\nand a giant mind and a giant will could carry on to execution.\r\n\r\nAs if to make the parallel with Columbus complete, Mr. Field passed his\r\nlast few days under the heavy shadow of misfortune. His son's failure,\r\nand the sensational developments attending it, were probably the\r\noccasion of his fatal illness. It is a melancholy termination of a\r\nremarkable career to which the nations of the earth owe a vast debt of\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nChicago _Tribune_, July 13, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe story of the twelve years' struggle to lay an Atlantic cable from\r\nIreland to Newfoundland is the story of one of the greatest battles with\r\nthe fates that any one man was ever called on to wage. It was a fight\r\nnot only against the ocean, jealous of its rights as a separator of the\r\ncontinents, and against natural obstacles which seemed absolutely\r\nunsurpassable, but a fight against stubborn Parliaments and Congresses,\r\nand all the stumbling blocks of human disbelief. But the courage of\r\nCyrus W. Field was indomitable. _His patience and zeal were\r\ninexhaustible, and so it came to pass, on July 27, 1866, that this man\r\nknelt down in his cabin, like a second Columbus, and gave thanks to God,\r\nfor his labors were crowned with success at last._\r\n\r\nHe had lost his health. He had worn out his nervous forces by the\r\ntremendous strain, and he paid in excruciating suffering the debt he\r\nowed to nature. But he had won a fortune and a lasting fame.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOSTON STATUE.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the Italian merchants of Boston, under the presidency of Mr.\r\nIasigi, presented to the city a statue of Columbus, which was placed\r\ninside the inclosure of Louisburg Square, at the Pinckney Street end of\r\nthe square. The statue, which is of inferior merit, bears no\r\ninscription, and is at the present date forgotten, dilapidated, and fast\r\nfalling into decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nYOU CAN NOT CONQUER AMERICA.\r\n\r\n     FLAVIUS J.

From his \"History of\r\n     the United States.\"\r\n\r\nWith a patience that nothing could wear out, and a perseverance that,\r\nwas absolutely unconquerable, Columbus waited and labored for eighteen\r\nyears, appealing to minds that wanted light and to ears that wanted\r\nhearing. His ideas of the possibilities of navigation were before his\r\ntime. It was one thing to creep along the coast of Africa, where the\r\nhold upon the land need never be lost, another to steer out boldly into\r\nthat wilderness of waters, over which mystery and darkness brooded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SANTA MARIA CARAVEL.\r\n\r\n     J.

Born at\r\n     Roxbury, New York, April 3, 1837. From a letter in the _St.\r\n     Nicholas Magazine_ of July, 1892. (See _post_, NASON.)\r\n\r\nThere are a great many species of the thorn distributed throughout the\r\nUnited States. All the Northern species, so far as I know, have white\r\nflowers. In the South they are more inclined to be pink or roseate. If\r\nColumbus picked up at sea a spray of the thorn, it was doubtless some\r\nSouthern species. Let us believe it was the Washington thorn, which\r\ngrows on the banks of streams from Virginia to the Gulf, and loads\r\nheavily with small red fruit.\r\n\r\nThe thorn belongs to the great family of trees that includes the apple,\r\npeach, pear, raspberry, strawberry, etc., namely, the rose family, or\r\n_Rosaceæ_. Hence the apple, pear, and plum are often grafted on the\r\nwhite thorn.\r\n\r\nA curious thing about the thorns is that they are suppressed or\r\nabortive branches. The ancestor of this tree must have been terribly\r\nabused sometime to have its branches turn to thorns.\r\n\r\nI have an idea that persistent cultivation and good treatment would\r\ngreatly mollify the sharp temper of the thorn, if not change it\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nThe flower of the thorn would become us well as a National flower. It\r\nbelongs to such a hardy, spunky, unconquerable tree, and to such a\r\nnumerous and useful family. Certainly, it would be vastly better than\r\nthe merely delicate and pretty wild flowers that have been so generally\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN AND SEAMEN.\r\n\r\n     RICHARD E. BURTON, in the Denver (Colo.) _Times_, 1892.\r\n\r\n  I see a galleon of Spanish make,\r\n    That westward like a wingéd creature flies,\r\n    Above a sea dawn-bright, and arched with skies\r\n  Expectant of the sun and morning-break.\r\n  The sailors from the deck their land-thirst slake\r\n    With peering o'er the waves, until their eyes\r\n    Discern a coast that faint and dream-like lies,\r\n  The while they pray, weep, laugh, or madly take\r\n  Their shipmates in their arms and speak no word.\r\n    And then I see a figure, tall, removed\r\n    A little from the others, as behooved,\r\n  That since the dawn has neither spoke nor stirred;\r\n  A noble form, the looming mast beside,\r\n  Columbus, calm, his prescience verified.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAUTIES OF THE BAHAMA SEA.\r\n\r\n     HEZEKIAH BUTTERWORTH, American author. Born in Rhode Island, 1839.\r\n     From an article, \"The Sea of Discovery,\" in _The Youth's\r\n     Companion_, June 9, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe Bahama Sea is perhaps the most beautiful of all waters. Columbus\r\nbeheld it and its islands with a poet's eye.\r\n\r\n\"It only needed the singing of the nightingale,\" said the joyful\r\nmariner, \"to make it like Andalusia in April;\" and to his mind Andalusia\r\nwas the loveliest place on earth. In sailing among these gardens of the\r\nseas in the serene and transparent autumn days after the great\r\ndiscovery, the soul of Columbus was at times overwhelmed and entranced\r\nby a sense of the beauty of everything in it and about it. Life seemed,\r\nas it were, a spiritual vision.\r\n\r\n\"I know not,\" said the discoverer, \"where first to go; nor are my eyes\r\never weary of gazing on the beautiful verdure. The singing of the birds\r\nis such that it seems as if one would never desire to depart hence.\"\r\n\r\nHe speaks in a poet's phrases of the odorous trees, and of the clouds of\r\nparrots whose bright wings obscured the sun. His descriptions of the sea\r\nand its gardens are full of glowing and sympathetic colorings, and all\r\nthings to him had a spiritual meaning.\r\n\r\n\"God,\" he said, on reviewing his first voyage over these western waters,\r\n\"God made me the messenger of the new heavens and earth, and told me\r\nwhere to find them. Charts, maps, and mathematical knowledge had nothing\r\nto do with the case.\"\r\n\r\nOn announcing his discovery on his return, he breaks forth into the\r\nfollowing highly poetic exhortation: \"Let processions be formed, let\r\nfestivals be held, let lauds be sung. Let Christ rejoice on earth.\"\r\n\r\nColumbus was a student of the Greek and Latin poets, and of the poetry\r\nof the Hebrew Scriptures. The visions of Isaiah were familiar to him,\r\nand he thought that Isaiah himself at one time appeared to him in a\r\nvision. He loved nature. To him the outer world was a garment of the\r\nInvisible; and it was before his great soul had suffered\r\ndisappointment that he saw the sun-flooded waters of the Bahama Sea\r\nand the purple splendors of the Antilles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PASEO COLON (COLUMBUS PROMENADE), BARCELONA, SPAIN.\r\n\r\nWith the Columbus Monument in the background.\r\n\r\nSee page 81]\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely an adjective in the picturesque report of Columbus in\r\nregard to this sea and these islands that is not now as appropriate and\r\nfitting as in the days when its glowing words delighted Isabella 400\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN HISTORY DOES THEE WRONG.\r\n\r\n     GEORGE GORDON NOEL, LORD BYRON, one of England's famous poets.

From\r\n     \"Past and Present.\"\r\n\r\nBrave Sea-captain, Norse Sea-king, Columbus, my hero, royalest Sea-king\r\nof all! it is no friendly environment this of thine, in the waste deep\r\nwaters; around thee, mutinous, discouraged souls; behind thee, disgrace\r\nand ruin; before thee, the unpenetrated veil of Night. Brother, these\r\nwild water-mountains, bounding from their deep basin--ten miles deep, I\r\nam told--are not entirely there on thy behalf! Meseems they have other\r\nwork than floating thee forward; and the huge winds that sweep from Ursa\r\nMajor to the Tropics and Equator, dancing their giant waltz through the\r\nkingdoms of Chaos and Immensity, they care little about filling rightly\r\nor filling wrongly the small shoulder-of-mutton sails in this\r\ncockle-skiff of thine. Thou art not among articulate-speaking friends,\r\nmy brother; thou art among immeasurable dumb monsters, tumbling,\r\nhowling, wide as the world here. Secret, far off, invisible to all\r\nhearts but thine, there lies a help in them; see how thou wilt get at\r\nthat. Patiently thou wilt wait till the mad southwester spend itself,\r\nsaving thyself by dextrous science of defense the while; valiantly, with\r\nswift decision, wilt thou strike in, when the favoring east, the\r\nPossible, springs up. Mutiny of men thou wilt entirely repress;\r\nweakness, despondency, thou wilt cheerily encourage; thou wilt swallow\r\ndown complaint, unreason, weariness, weakness of others and thyself.\r\nThere shall be a depth of silence in thee deeper than this sea, which is\r\nbut ten miles deep; a silence unsoundable, known to God only. Thou shalt\r\nbe a great man. Yes, my World-soldier, thou wilt have to be greater than\r\nthis tumultuous, unmeasured world here around thee; thou, in thy strong\r\nsoul, as with wrestler's arms, shalt embrace it, harness it down, and\r\nmake it bear thee on--to new Americas.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTBOUND.\r\n\r\n     BLISS CARMAN, from a poem in the _Century Magazine_, 1892.[30]\r\n\r\n  A lonely sail in the vast sea-room,\r\n  I have put out for the port of gloom.\r\n\r\n  The voyage is far on the trackless tide,\r\n  The watch is long, and the seas are wide.\r\n\r\n  The headlands, blue in the sinking day,\r\n  Kiss me a hand on the outward way.\r\n\r\n  The fading gulls, as they dip and veer,\r\n  Lift me a voice that is good to hear.\r\n\r\n  The great winds come, and the heaving sea,\r\n  The restless mother, is calling me.\r\n\r\n  The cry of her heart is lone and wild,\r\n  Searching the night for her wandered child.\r\n\r\n  Beautiful, weariless mother of mine,\r\n  In the drift of doom I am here, I am thine.\r\n\r\n  Beyond the fathom of hope or fear,\r\n  From bourn to bourn of the dusk I steer.\r\n\r\n  Swept on in the wake of the stars, in the stream\r\n  Of a roving tide, from dream to dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUTES OF THE PHOENIX OF THE AGES.\r\n\r\n     LOPE DE VEGA CARPIO, a celebrated Spanish poet and dramatist.

[See also _ante_, Boston\r\n     _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nThe suggestion has been made by Mr. John Boyd Thacher, commissioner from\r\nNew York to the World's Fair, that a tribute be paid to the memory of\r\nAmerigo Vespucci by opening the Fair May 5, 1893, that being the\r\nanniversary of America's christening day. Mr. Thacher's suggestion is\r\nbased upon the fact that May 5, 1507, there was published at the\r\nCollege of Saint-Dié, in Lorraine, the \"Cosmographic Introductio,\" by\r\nWaldseemuller, in which the name of America \"for the fourth part of the\r\nworld\" (Europe, Asia, and Africa being the other three parts) was first\r\nadvocated, in honor of Amerigo Vespucci. As Mr. Thacher's suggestion\r\nalready has aroused considerable jealous opposition among the Italians\r\nof New York, who claim all the glory for Columbus, a statement of what\r\nwas really discovered by the two great explorers will be of interest at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nNo writer of the present day has shed a clearer light upon this question\r\nthan John Fiske, and it may be incidentally added, no student has done\r\nmore than he to relieve Amerigo Vespucci from the reproach which has\r\nbeen fastened upon his reputation as an explorer, by critics, who, as\r\nMr. Fiske clearly shows, have been misled by the sources of their\r\nauthority and have judged him from erroneous standpoints. In making a\r\nstatement of what the two explorers really discovered, the _Tribune_\r\nfollows on the lines of Prof. Fiske's investigation as the clearest,\r\nmost painstaking, and most authoritative that has yet been made.\r\n\r\nChristopher Columbus made four voyages. On the first he sailed from\r\nPalos, Friday, August 3, 1492, and Friday, October 12th (new style,\r\nOctober 21st), discovered land in the West Indies. It was one of the\r\nislands of the Bahamas, called by the natives Guanahani, and named by\r\nhim San Salvador; which name, after the seventeenth century, was applied\r\nto Cat Island, though which one of the islands is the true San Salvador\r\nis still a matter of dispute.\r\n\r\nAfter spending ten days among the Bahamas Columbus (October 25th)\r\nsteered south and reached the great Island of Cuba. He cruised around\r\nthe east coast of the big island, and December 6th landed at Haiti,\r\nanother immense island. A succession of disasters ended his voyage and\r\nhe thereupon returned to Spain, arriving there March 15, 1493.\r\n\r\nColumbus sailed on his second voyage September 25, 1493, and November 3d\r\nlanded at Dominica in the Caribbean Sea. During a two-weeks' cruise he\r\ndiscovered the islands of Marigalante, Guadaloupe, and Antigua, and\r\nlastly the large Island of Puerto Rico. April 24th he set out on another\r\ncruise of discovery. He followed the south coast of Cuba and came to\r\nJamaica, the third largest of the West Indies, thence returning to Cuba,\r\nand from there to Spain, where he arrived June 11, 1494. On his third\r\nvoyage he sailed May 30, 1498. Following a more southerly course, he\r\narrived at Trinidad, and in coasting along saw the delta of the Orinoco\r\nRiver of South America and went into the Gulf of Paria. Thence he\r\nfollowed the north coast of Venezuela and finally arrived at Santo\r\nDomingo.\r\n\r\nThe story of his arrest there is well known. He was taken in chains to\r\nCadiz, Spain, arriving there in December, 1500.\r\n\r\nOn his fourth and last voyage he sailed May 11, 1502. On June 15th he\r\nwas at Martinique. He touched at Santo Domingo, thence sailed across to\r\nCape Honduras, doubled that cape, and skirted the coast of Nicaragua,\r\nwhere he heard of the Pacific Ocean, though the name had not its present\r\nmeaning for him. It was during his attempt to find the Isthmus of\r\nDarien, which he thought was a strait of water, that he was shipwrecked\r\non the coast of Jamaica. He remained there a year and then went back to\r\nSpain, reaching home November 7, 1504. It was the last voyage of the\r\ngreat navigator, and it will be observed that he never saw or stepped\r\nfoot on the mainland of _North_ America, though he saw South America in\r\n1498, as stated. In 1506 he died in Spain.\r\n\r\nAmerigo Vespucci, like Columbus, made four voyages, some of the details\r\nof which are known. His letter, written to his friend Piero Soderini,\r\nSeptember 4, 1504, gives us information concerning his famous first\r\nvoyage. Hitherto the only copy of this letter known was a Latin\r\ntranslation of it published at the College of Saint-Dié, April 25, 1507,\r\nbut the primitive text from which the translation was made has been\r\nfound, and by that text Americus' reputation has been saved from the\r\ndiscredit critics and biographers have cast upon it, and his true\r\nlaurels have been restored to him. The mistake of changing one word, the\r\nIndian name \"Lariab,\" in the original, to \"Parias,\" in the Latin\r\nversion, is accountable for it all. The scene of his explorations is now\r\ntransferred from Parias, in South America, to Lariab, in North America,\r\nand his entire letter is freed from mystery or inconsistency with the\r\nclaims which have been made for him.\r\n\r\nIt is now established beyond controversy that Americus sailed on the\r\nfirst voyage, not as commander, but as astronomer, of the expedition,\r\nMay 10, 1497, and first ran to the Grand Canaries. Leaving there May\r\n25th, the first landfall was on the northern coast of Honduras of North\r\nAmerica. Thence he sailed around Yucatan and up the Mexican coast to\r\nTampico (\"Lariab,\" not \"Parias\"). After making some inland explorations\r\nhe followed the coast line 870 leagues (2,610 miles), which would take\r\nhim along our Southern gulf coast, around Florida, and north along the\r\nAtlantic coast until \"they found themselves in a fine harbor.\" Was this\r\nCharleston harbor or Hampton Roads? In any event, when he started back\r\nto Spain he sailed from the Atlantic coast somewhere between Capes\r\nCharles and Canaveral. The outcome of this voyage was the first\r\ndiscovery of Honduras, parts of the Mexican and Florida coasts, the\r\ninsularity of Cuba--which Columbus thought was part of the mainland of\r\nAsia--and 4,000 miles of the coast line of North America. The remaining\r\nthree voyages have no bearing upon North American discovery. On the\r\nsecond, he explored the northern coast of Brazil to the Gulf of\r\nMaracaibo; on the third, he went again to the Brazilian coast and found\r\nthe Island of South Georgia, and on the fourth returned to Brazil, but\r\nwithout making any discoveries of importance.\r\n\r\nMr. Fiske's luminous narrative lends significance to Mr. Thacher's\r\nsuggestion, for Vespucci discovered a large portion of the mainland of\r\nthe North American continent which Columbus had never seen. To this\r\nextent his first voyage gave a new meaning to Columbus' work, without\r\ndiminishing, however, the glory of the latter's great achievement.\r\nAmericus, indeed, had his predecessors, for John and Sebastian Cabot,\r\nsent out by Henry VII. of England a short time before his discovery, had\r\nset foot upon Labrador, and probably had visited Nova Scotia. And even\r\nbefore Cabot, the Northern Vikings, among them Leif Ericcson, had found\r\ntheir way to this continent and perhaps set up their Vineland in\r\nMassachusetts. And before the Vikings there may have been other\r\nmigrants, and before the migrants the aborigines, who were the victims\r\nof all the explorers from the Vikings to the Puritans. But their\r\nachievements had no meaning and left no results. As Prof. Fiske says:\r\n\"In no sense was any real contact established between the eastern and\r\nwestern halves of our planet until the great voyage of Columbus in\r\n1492.\" It was that voyage which inspired the great voyage of Americus in\r\n1497. He followed the path marked out by Columbus, and he invested the\r\nlatter's discovery with a new significance. Upon the basis of merit and\r\nhistorical fact, therefore, Mr. Thacher's suggestion deserves\r\nconsideration; and why should Italians be jealous, when Christopher\r\nColumbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and John Cabot were all of Italian birth?\r\n\r\n\r\nALL WITHIN THE KEN OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     HYDE CLARKE, Vice-President Royal Historical Society of England, in\r\n     his \"Examination of the Legend of Atlantis,\" etc. London: Longmans,\r\n     Green & Co., 1886.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Columbus, as well as others, was discussing the subject\r\nof new lands to be discovered, literary resources had become available.\r\nThe Latin writers could be examined; but, above all, the fall of\r\nConstantinople had driven numbers of Greeks into Italy. The Greek\r\nlanguage was studied, and Greek books were eagerly bought by the Latin\r\nnations, as before they had been by the Arabs. Thus, all that had been\r\nwritten as to the four worlds was within the ken of Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS A HERETIC AND A VISIONARY TO HIS CONTEMPORARIES.\r\n\r\n     JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE, an American writer and Unitarian minister.\r\n     Born at Hanover, N. H., in 1810; died at Jamaica Plain, June 8,\r\n     1888.[32]\r\n\r\nWe think of Columbus as the great discoverer of America; we do not\r\nremember that his actual life was one of disappointment and failure.\r\nEven his discovery of America was a disappointment; he was looking for\r\nIndia, and utterly failed of this. He made maps and sold them to support\r\nhis old father. Poverty, contumely, indignities of all sorts, met him\r\nwherever he turned. His expectations were considered extravagant, his\r\nschemes futile; the theologians exposed him with texts out of the Bible;\r\nhe wasted seven years waiting in vain for encouragement at the court of\r\nSpain. He applied unsuccessfully to the governments of Venice, Portugal,\r\nGenoa, France, England. Practical men said, \"It can't be done. He is a\r\nvisionary.\" Doctors of divinity said, \"He is a heretic; he contradicts\r\nthe Bible.\" Isabella, being a woman, and a woman of sentiment, wished\r\nto help him; but her confessor said no. We all know how he was compelled\r\nto put down mutiny in his crew, and how, after his discovery was made,\r\nhe was rewarded with chains and imprisonment, how he died in neglect,\r\npoverty, and pain, and only was rewarded by a sumptuous funeral. His\r\ngreat hope, his profound convictions, were his only support and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIKE HOMER--A BEGGAR IN THE GATE.\r\n\r\n     DIEGO CLEMENCIN, a Spanish statesman and author of merit. Born at\r\n     Murcia, 1765; died, 1834. From his \"Elogio de la Reina Catolica,\r\n     Isabella de Castilla\" (1851).\r\n\r\nA man obscure, and but little known, followed at this time the court.\r\nConfounded in the crowd of unfortunate applicants, feeding his\r\nimagination in the corners of antechambers with the pompous project of\r\ndiscovering a world, melancholy and dejected in the midst of the general\r\nrejoicing, he beheld with indifference, and almost with contempt, the\r\nconclusion of a conquest which swelled all bosoms with jubilee, and\r\nseemed to have reached the utmost bounds of desire. That man was\r\nChristopher Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CATHOLIC KNIGHT.\r\n\r\n     JAMES DAVID COLEMAN, Supreme President of the Catholic Knights of\r\n     America, in an address to the members of that body, September 10,\r\n     1892.\r\n\r\nHistory tells that the anxious journey was begun by Columbus and his\r\nresolute band, approaching Holy Communion at Palos, on August 3, 1492;\r\nthat its prosecution, through sacrifices and perils, amid harrowing\r\nuncertainties, was stamped with an exalted faith and unyielding trust in\r\nGod, and that its marvelous and glorious consummation, in October, 1492,\r\nwas acknowledged by the chivalrous knight, in tearful gratitude, on\r\nbended knee, at the foot of the cross of Christ, as the merciful gift of\r\nhis omnipotent Master. Then it was that Christopher Columbus, the first\r\nCatholic knight of America, made the gracious Christian tribute of\r\ngrateful recognition of Divine assistance by planting upon the soil of\r\nhis newly discovered land the true emblem of Christianity and of man's\r\nredemption--the cross of our Savior. And then, reverently kneeling\r\nbefore the cross, and with eyes and hearts uplifted to their immolated\r\nGod, this valiant band of Christian knights uttered from the virgin sod\r\nof America the first pious supplication that He would abundantly bless\r\nHis gift to Columbus; and the unequaled grandeur of our civil structure\r\nof to-day tells the manifest response to those prayers of 400 years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY FAITH COLUMBUS FOUND AMERICA.\r\n\r\n     ROBERT COLLYER, a distinguished pulpit orator. Born at Keighley,\r\n     Yorkshire, December 8, 1823.\r\n\r\nThe successful men in the long fight with fortune are the cheerful men,\r\nor those, certainly, who find the fair background of faith and hope.\r\nColumbus, but for this, had never found our New World.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF COLON STATUE.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Colon, Department of Panama, Colombia, stands a statue to\r\nthe memory of Columbus, of some artistic merit. The great Genoese is\r\nrepresented as encircling the neck of an Indian youth with his\r\nprotecting arm, a representation somewhat similar to the pose of the\r\nstatue in the plaza of the city of Santo Domingo. This statue was\r\ndonated by the ex-Empress of the French, and on a wooden tablet\r\nattached to the concrete pedestal the following inscription appears:\r\n\r\n  Statue de\r\n  CHRISTOPHE COLOMB\r\n  Donnée par\r\n  L'Impératrice Eugénie\r\n  Erigée à Colon\r\n  Par Decret de la Legislature de\r\n  Colombie\r\n  Au 29 Juin, 1866,\r\n  Par les soins de la Compagnie\r\n  Universelle du Canal Maritime\r\n  De Panama\r\n  Le 21 Fevrier, 1886.[33]\r\n\r\n  Translation:\r\n\r\n  Statue of\r\n  CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS\r\n  Presented by\r\n  The Empress Eugénie\r\n  Erected in honor of Columbus\r\n  By Decree of the Legislature of\r\n  Colombia\r\n  The 29th of June, 1866,\r\n  Under the Supervision of the Universal\r\n  Company of the Maritime Canal\r\n  Of Panama\r\n  The 21st of February, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMBUS OF LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nFrancis Bacon, Baron Verulam, Viscount St. Albans, commonly called Lord\r\nBacon, is generally so called.

Born at Cordova, 1488; died\r\n     at Valladolid, 1539.\r\n\r\nHe was tall, well formed, muscular, and of an elevated and dignified\r\ndemeanor. His visage was long, neither full nor meager; his complexion\r\nfair and freckled, and inclined to ruddy; his nose aquiline; his cheek\r\nbones were rather high, his eyes light gray, and apt to enkindle; his\r\nwhole countenance had an air of authority. His hair, in his youthful\r\ndays, was of a light color, but care and trouble, according to Las\r\nCasas, soon turned it gray, and at thirty years of age it was quite\r\nwhite. He was moderate and simple in diet and apparel, eloquent in\r\ndiscourse, engaging and affable with strangers, and his amiability and\r\nsuavity in domestic life strongly attached his household to his person.\r\nHis temper was naturally irritable, but he subdued it by the\r\nmagnanimity of his spirits, comporting himself with a courteous and\r\ngentle gravity, and never indulging in any intemperance of language.\r\nThroughout his life he was noted for strict attention to the offices of\r\nreligion, observing rigorously the fasts and ceremonies of the church;\r\nnor did his piety consist in mere forms, but partook of that lofty and\r\nsolemn enthusiasm with which his whole character was strongly tinctured.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n     KINAHAN CORNWALLIS.

(See page 109.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCUBA'S CAVES--THE MANTLE OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nIn the caves of Bellamar, near Matanzas, Cuba, are sparkling columns of\r\ncrystal 150 feet high; one is called the \"Mantle of Columbus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTRAITS OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     The Hon. WILLIAM ELEROY CURTIS, an American journalist, Secretary\r\n     of the Bureau of the American Republics, Washington, D. C. Born at\r\n     Akron, Ohio. From an article, \"The Columbus Portraits,\" in the\r\n     _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, January, 1892.\r\n\r\nAlthough Columbus twice mentioned in his alleged will that he was a\r\nnative of Genoa, a dozen places still demand the honor of being\r\nconsidered his birthplace, and two claim to possess his bones. Nothing\r\nis certain about his parentage, and his age is the subject of dispute.\r\nThe stories of his boyhood adventures are mythical, and his education at\r\nthe University of Pavia is denied.\r\n\r\nThe same doubt attends the various portraits that pretend to represent\r\nhis features. The most reliable authorities--and the subject has been\r\nunder discussion for two centuries--agree that there is no tangible\r\nevidence to prove that the face of Columbus was ever painted or sketched\r\nor graven, during his life. His portrait has been painted, like that of\r\nthe Madonna and those of the saints, by many famous artists, each\r\ndependent upon verbal descriptions of his appearance by contemporaneous\r\nwriters, and each conveying to the canvas his own conception of what the\r\ngreat seaman's face must have been; but it may not be said that any of\r\nthe portraits are genuine, and it is believed that all of them are more\r\nor less fanciful.\r\n\r\nIt must be considered that the art of painting portraits was in its\r\ninfancy when Columbus lived. The honor was reserved for kings and queens\r\nand other dignitaries, and Columbus was regarded as an importunate\r\nadventurer, who at the close of his first voyage enjoyed a brief\r\ntriumph, but from the termination of his second voyage was the victim of\r\nenvy and misrepresentation to the close of his life. He was derided and\r\ncondemned, was brought in chains like a common felon from the continent\r\nhe had discovered, and for nearly two hundred years his descendants\r\ncontested in the courts for the dignities and emoluments he demanded of\r\nthe crown of Spain before undertaking what was then the most perilous\r\nand uncertain of adventures. Even the glory of giving his name to the\r\nlands he discovered was transferred to another--a man who followed in\r\nhis track; and it is not strange, under such circumstances, that the\r\nartists of Spain did not leave the religious subjects upon which they\r\nwere engaged to paint the portrait of one who said of himself that he\r\nwas a beggar \"without a penny to buy food.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STANDARD OF MODERN CRITICISM.\r\n\r\n     The Hon. WILLIAM ELEROY CURTIS, in an able article in the\r\n     _Chautauquan Magazine_, September, 1892.\r\n\r\nWhether the meager results of recent investigation are more reliable\r\nthan the testimony of earlier pens is a serious question, and the\r\nsympathetic and generous reader will challenge the right of modern\r\nhistorians to destroy and reject traditions to which centuries have paid\r\nreverence. The failure to supply evidence in place of that which has\r\nbeen discarded is of itself sufficient to impair faith in the modern\r\ncreation, and simply demonstrates the fallacy of the theory that what\r\ncan not be proven did not exist. If the same analysis to which the\r\ncareer of Columbus has been subjected should be applied to every\r\ncharacter in sacred and secular history, there would be little left\r\namong the world's great heroes to admire. So we ask permission to retain\r\nthe old ideal, and remember the discoverer of our hemisphere as a man\r\nof human weaknesses but of stern purpose, inflexible will, undaunted\r\ncourage, patience, and professional theories most of which modern\r\nscience has demonstrated to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ITALIAN CONTEMPORARY TRIBUTE.\r\n\r\n     GIULIO DATI, a Florentine poet. Born, 1560; died about 1630.\r\n\r\nA lengthy poem, in _ottava rima_ (founded upon the first letter of\r\nColumbus announcing his success), was composed in 1493, by Giulio Dati,\r\nthe famous Florentine poet, and was sung in the streets of that city to\r\npublish the discovery of the New World. The full Italian text is to be\r\nfound in R. H. Major's \"Select Letters of Christopher Columbus,\" Hakluyt\r\nSociety, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUTINY AT SEA.[35]\r\n\r\n     JEAN FRANÇOIS CASIMIR DELAVIGNE, a popular French poet and\r\n     dramatist. Born at Havre, April 4, 1793; died at Lyons, December,\r\n     1843.\r\n\r\nTHREE DAYS.\r\n\r\n  On the deck stood Columbus; the ocean's expanse,\r\n  Untried and unlimited, swept by his glance.\r\n  \"Back to Spain!\" cry his men; \"put the vessel about!\r\n  We venture no farther through danger and doubt.\"\r\n  \"Three days, and I give you a world,\" he replied;\r\n  \"Bear up, my brave comrades--three days shall decide.\"\r\n  He sails--but no token of land is in sight;\r\n  He sails--but the day shows no more than the night;\r\n  On, onward he sails, while in vain o'er the lee\r\n  The lead is plunged down through a fathomless sea.\r\n  The second day's past, and Columbus is sleeping,\r\n  While mutiny near him its vigil is keeping.\r\n  \"Shall he perish?\" \"Ay, death!\" is the barbarous cry.\r\n  \"He must triumph to-morrow, or, perjured, must die!\"\r\n  Ungrateful and blind! shall the world-linking sea,\r\n  He traced, for the future his sepulcher be?\r\n  Shall that sea, on the morrow, with pitiless waves,\r\n  Fling his corse on that shore which his patient eye craves?\r\n  The corse of a humble adventurer, then.\r\n  One day later--Columbus, the first among men.\r\n\r\n  But, hush! he is dreaming! A veil on the main,\r\n  At the distant horizon, is parted in twain;\r\n  And now on his dreaming eye--rapturous sight--\r\n  Fresh bursts the New World from the darkness of night.\r\n  O vision of glory! how dazzling it seems;\r\n  How glistens the verdure! how sparkle the streams!\r\n  How blue the far mountains! how glad the green isles!\r\n  And the earth and the ocean, how dimpled with smiles!\r\n  \"Joy! joy!\" cries Columbus, \"this region is mine!\"\r\n  Ah, not e'en its name, wondrous dreamer, is thine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONOR THE HARDY NORSEMEN.\r\n\r\n     The Rev.

DEPEW, one of the leading American orators of the\r\n     nineteenth century. From an oration on \"Columbus and the\r\n     Exposition,\" delivered in Chicago in 1890.\r\n\r\nIt is not sacrilege to say that the two events to which civilization\r\nto-day owes its advanced position are the introduction of Christianity\r\nand the discovery of America.\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus sailed from Palos, types had been discovered, but church\r\nand state held intelligence by the throat.\r\n\r\nSustained enthusiasm has been the motor of every movement in the\r\nprogress of mankind.\r\n\r\nGenius, pluck, endurance, and faith can be resisted by neither kings nor\r\ncabinets.\r\n\r\nColumbus stands deservedly at the head of that most useful band of\r\nmen--the heroic cranks in history.\r\n\r\nThe persistent enthusiast whom one generation despises as a lunatic with\r\none idea, succeeding ones often worship as a benefactor.\r\n\r\nThis whole country is ripe and ready for the inspection of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENOA--WHENCE GRAND COLUMBUS CAME.\r\n\r\n     AUBREY THOMAS DE VERE, an English poet and political writer.

Drake,\r\na prominent and respected citizen, is to occupy a space between the city\r\nhall and the court house buildings, on the Washington Street frontage.\r\nThe monument is to be Gothic in style, and the base will be composed of\r\ngranite from Baveno, Italy. The design includes a pedestal, on the front\r\nof which will be placed a bronze statue of Christopher Columbus, seven\r\nfeet high, which is to be cast in the royal foundry at Rome. The statue\r\nwill be the production of an American artist of reputation, Mr. R. H.\r\nPark of Chicago. The fountain is to be provided with an ice-chamber\r\ncapable of holding two tons of ice, and is to be surrounded with a\r\nwater-pipe containing ten faucets, each supplied with a bronze cup. The\r\nentire cost will be $15,000. Mr. Drake's generous gift to Chicago is to\r\nbe ready for public use in 1892, and it will, therefore, be happily\r\ncommemorative of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by\r\nColumbus. The inscription on the fountain reads: \"Ice-water drinking\r\nfountain presented to the City of Chicago by John B. Drake 1892.\" At the\r\nfeet of the statue of Columbus, who is represented as a student of\r\ngeography in his youth at the University of Pavia, is inscribed,\r\n\"Christopher Columbus, 1492-1892.\"\r\n\r\nThe fountain is a very handsome piece of bronze art work, and\r\nCommissioner Aldrich has decided to place it in a conspicuous place,\r\nbeing none other than the area between the court house and the city\r\nhall, facing Washington Street. This central and accessible spot of\r\npublic ground has been an unsightly stabling place for horses ever since\r\nthe court house was built. It will now be sodded, flower-beds will be\r\nlaid out, and macadamized walks will surround the Drake Fountain. The\r\nnew feature will be a relief to weary eyes, and an ornament to\r\nWashington Street and the center of the city.\r\n\r\nThe red granite base for the fountain has been received at the custom\r\nhouse. It was made in Turin, Italy, and cost $3,300. Under the law, the\r\nstone came in duty free, as it is intended as a gift to the\r\nmunicipality.\r\n\r\n\r\nDREAM.\r\n\r\n     JOHN WILLIAM DRAPER, a celebrated American chemist and scientist.\r\n     Born near Liverpool, England, 1811; died January 4, 1882. From his\r\n     \"Intellectual Development of Europe,\" 1876. By permission of\r\n     Messrs. Harper & Brothers, Publishers, New York.\r\n\r\nColumbus appears to have formed his theory that the East Indies could be\r\nreached by sailing to the west about A. D. 1474. He was at that time in\r\ncorrespondence with Toscanelli, the Florentine astronomer, who held the\r\nsame doctrine, and who sent him a map or chart constructed on the\r\ntravels of Marco Polo. He offered his services first to his native city,\r\nthen to Portugal, then to Spain, and, through his brother, to England;\r\nhis chief inducement, in each instance, being that the riches of India\r\nmight be thus secured. In Lisbon he had married. While he lay sick near\r\nBelem, an unknown voice whispered to him in a dream, \"God will cause thy\r\nname to be wonderfully resounded through the earth, and will give thee\r\nthe keys of the gates of the ocean which are closed with strong chains.\"\r\nThe death of his wife appears to have broken the last link which held\r\nhim to Portugal, where he had been since 1470. One evening, in the\r\nautumn of 1485, a man of majestic presence, pale, careworn, and, though\r\nin the meridian of life, with silver hair, leading a little boy by the\r\nhand, asked alms at the gate of the Franciscan convent near Palos--not\r\nfor himself, but only a little bread and water for his child. This was\r\nthat Columbus destined to give to Europe a new world.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PEN-PICTURE FROM THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n     The Right Rev. ANTHONY DURIER, Bishop of Natchitoches, La., in a\r\n     circular letter to the clergy and laity of the diocese, printed in\r\n     the New Orleans _Morning Star_, September 10, 1892.\r\n\r\nWe cherish the memory of the illustrious sailor, also of the lady and of\r\nthe monk who were providential instruments in opening a new world to\r\nreligion and civilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nDesigned by H. H. Zearing of Chicago.]\r\n\r\nHonor to the sailor, Christopher Columbus, the Christ-bearing dove, as\r\nhis name tells, gentle as a dove of hallowed memory as Christ-bearer. In\r\nfact, he brought Christ to the New World. Look back at that sailor, 400\r\nyears ago, on bended knees, with hands uplifted in prayer, on the shores\r\nof Guanahani, first to invoke the name of Jesus in the New World; in\r\nfact, as in name, behold the Christ-bearing dove. Columbus was a knight\r\nof the cross, with his good cross-hilted sword, blessed by the church.\r\nThe first aim and ambition of a knight of the cross, at that time, was\r\nto plant the cross in the midst of heathen nations, and to have them\r\nbrought from \"the region of the shadow of death\" into the life-giving\r\nbosom of Mother Church.\r\n\r\nListen to the prayer of Columbus, as he brings his lips to, and kneels\r\non, the blessed land he has discovered, that historic prayer which he\r\nhad prepared long in advance, and which all Catholic discoverers\r\nrepeated after him: \"O Lord God, eternal and omnipotent, who by Thy\r\ndivine word hast created the heavens, the earth, and the sea! Blessed\r\nand glorified be thy name and praised Thy majesty, who hast deigned by\r\nme, thy humble servant, to have that sacred name made known and preached\r\nin this other part of the world.\"\r\n\r\nBehold the true knight of the cross, with cross-hilted sword in hand,\r\nthe name of Jesus on his lips, the glory of Jesus in his heart. He does\r\nnot say a word of the glory which, from the discovery, is bound to\r\naccrue to the name of Spain and to his own name; every word is directed\r\nto, and asking for, the glory of the name of Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe great discoverer has knelt down, kissed the ground, and said his\r\nprayer; now, look at that Catholic Spanish sailor standing up, in\r\ncommanding dignity, and planting his Catholic cross and his Spanish flag\r\non the discovered land; what does it mean? It means--the Spanish flag in\r\nAmerica for a time, and the Catholic cross in America forever.\r\n\r\nHail, flag of the discoverer! Spanish flag, the flag of the noble and\r\nthe daring. That Spanish flag came here first, had its glorious day, and\r\nstill in glory went back. Hail, Catholic cross! the cross of the\r\ndiscoverer. That cross is not to go back, as the Spanish flag; no, not\r\neven in glory. About that cross, only two simple words, and that settles\r\nit; that Catholic cross is here to stay. Hail, American flag!\r\nstar-spangled banner; the banner of the brave and of the free. That one,\r\nour own flag, came long after the Spanish flag, but we trust came to\r\nstay as long as the Catholic cross--until doom's-day.\r\n\r\nHonor to the lady, Queen Isabella the Catholic. Among all illustrious\r\nwomen, Isabella alone has been graced with the title of \"the\r\nCatholic,\"--a peerless title! And truly did she deserve the peerless\r\ntitle, the lady who threw heart and soul, and, over and above, her gold,\r\nin the discovery by which, out of the spiritual domains of the Catholic\r\nchurch, the sun sets no more; the lady who paved the way over the\r\nbounding sea to the great discoverer. Bright and energetic lady! She at\r\nonce understood Columbus and stood resolute, ready to pave him the way\r\neven with her jewels. Listen to her words: \"I undertake the enterprise\r\nfor my own crown of Castille, and I will pledge my jewels to raise the\r\nnecessary funds.\"\r\n\r\nThe generous lady had not to pledge her jewels; yet her gold was freely\r\nspent, lavished on the expedition; and she stood by Columbus, in storm\r\nand sunshine, as long as she lived. Isabella stood by Columbus, in his\r\nsuccess, with winsome gentleness, keeping up his daring spirit of\r\nenterprise; and, in his reverses, with the balm of unwavering devotion\r\nhealing his bruised, bleeding heart. Isabella stood by Columbus, as a\r\nmother by her son, ever, ever true to her heroic son.\r\n\r\nHonor to the humble monk, John Perez, Father John, as he was called in\r\nhis convent. That monk whose name will live as long as the names of\r\nColumbus and Isabella; that monk, great by his learning and still better\r\nby his heart; that humble, plain man inspired the sailor with\r\nperseverance indomitable, the lady with generosity unlimited, and\r\nsustained in both sailor and lady that will power and mount-removing\r\nfaith the result of which was to give \"to the Spanish King innumerable\r\ncountries and to God innumerable souls.\" As the Spanish poet, Lope de\r\nVega, beautifully puts it:\r\n\r\n  _Al Rey infinitas tierras,\r\n  Y á Dios infinitas almas._\r\n\r\nIt is the Spanish throne which backed Columbus; but, mind! that monk was\r\n\"the power behind the throne.\"\r\n\r\nWe Louisianians live, may be, in the fairest part of the New World\r\ndiscovered by Columbus. When Chevalier La Salle had explored the land,\r\nhe gave it the beautiful name of Louisiana, and he wrote to his king,\r\nLouis XIV., these words: \"The land we have explored and named Louisiana,\r\nafter your Majesty's name, is a paradise, the Eden of the New World.\"\r\nThanks be to God who has cast our lot in this paradise, the Eden of the\r\nNew World, fair Louisiana! Let us honor and ever cherish the memory of\r\nthe hero who led the way and opened this country to our forefathers.\r\nLouisiana was never blessed with the footprints of Columbus, yet by him\r\nit was opened to the onward march of the Christian nations.\r\n\r\nTo the great discoverer, Christopher Columbus, the gratitude of\r\nLouisiana, the Eden of the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMEO COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     REV. L. A. DUTTO of Jackson, Miss., in an article, \"Columbus in\r\n     Portugal,\" in the _Catholic World_, April, 1892.\r\n\r\nColumbus in 1492, accompanied by a motley crew of sailors of different\r\nnationalities, crossed the Atlantic and discovered America. Hence the\r\nglory of that event, second only in importance to the incarnation of\r\nChrist, is attributed very generally solely to him. As reflex lights of\r\nthat glory, history mentions the names of Queen Isabella, of the Pinzon\r\nbrothers, the friar Juan Perez. There is another name that should be\r\nplaced at head of the list. That is, Bartolomeo Columbus, the brother of\r\nChristopher. From the beginning there existed a partnership between the\r\ntwo in the mighty undertaking; the effect of a common conviction that\r\nthe land of spices, Cipango and Cathay, the East, could be reached by\r\ntraveling west. Both of them spent the best years of their life in\r\nprivation, hardship, and poverty, at times the laughing stock of the\r\ncourts of Europe, in humbly begging from monarchies and republics the\r\nships necessary to undertake their voyage. While Christopher patiently\r\nwaited in the antechambers of the Catholic monarchs of Spain,\r\nBartolomeo, map in hand, explained to Henry VII. of England the\r\nrotundity of the earth, and the feasibility of traveling to the\r\nantipodes. Having failed in his mission to the English king, he passed\r\nto France to ask of her what had been refused by Portugal, Spain,\r\nVenice, England, and Genoa. While he was there, Columbus, who had no\r\nmeans of communicating with him, sailed from Palos. Had there been, as\r\nnow, a system of international mails, Bartolomeo would now share with\r\nhis brother the title of Discoverer of America. Las Casas represents him\r\nas little inferior to Christopher in the art of navigation, and as a\r\nwriter and in things pertaining to cartography as his superior. Gallo,\r\nthe earliest biographer of Columbus, and writing during his lifetime,\r\nhas told us that Bartolomeo settled in Lisbon, and there made a living\r\nby drawing mariners' charts. Giustiniani, another countryman of\r\nColumbus, says in his polyglot Psalter, published in 1537, that\r\nChristopher learned cartography from his brother Bartolomeo, who had\r\nlearned it himself in Lisbon. But what may appear more surprising is the\r\nplain statement of Gallo that Bartolomeo was the first to conceive the\r\nidea of reaching the East by way of the West, by a transatlantic voyage,\r\nand that he communicated it to his brother, who was more experienced\r\nthan himself in nautical affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST GLIMPSE OF LAND.\r\n\r\n     CHARLES H. EDEN, English historical writer and traveler. From \"The\r\n     West Indies.\"\r\n\r\nNearly four centuries ago, in the year 1492, before the southern point\r\nof the great African continent had been doubled, and when the barbaric\r\nsplendor of Cathay and the wealth of Hindustan were only known to\r\nEuropeans through the narratives of Marco Polo or Sir John\r\nMandeville--early on the morning of Friday, October 12th, a man stood\r\nbareheaded on the deck of a caravel and watched the rising sun lighting\r\nup the luxuriant tropical vegetation of a level and beautiful island\r\ntoward which the vessel was gently speeding her way. Three-and-thirty\r\ndays had elapsed since the last known point of the Old World, the Island\r\nof Ferrol, had faded away over the high poop of his vessel; eventful\r\nweeks, during which he had to contend against the natural fears of the\r\nignorant and superstitious men by whom he was surrounded, and by the\r\nstratagem of a double reckoning, together with promises of future\r\nwealth, to allay the murmuring which threatened to frustrate the project\r\nthat for so many years had been nearest his heart. Never, in the darkest\r\nhour, did the courage of that man quail or his soul admit a single\r\ndoubt of success. When the terrified mariners remarked with awe that the\r\nneedle deviated from the pole star, their intrepid Admiral, by an\r\ningenious theory of his own, explained the cause of the phenomenon and\r\nsoothed the alarm that had arisen. When the steady trade-winds were\r\nreached, and the vessels flew rapidly for days toward the west, the\r\ncommander hailed as a godsend the mysterious breeze that his followers\r\nregarded with awe as imposing an insuperable barrier to their return to\r\nsunny Spain. When the prow of the caravel was impeded, and her way\r\ndeadened by the drifting network of the Sargasso Sea, the leader saw\r\ntherein only assured indications of land, and resolutely shut his ears\r\nagainst those prophets who foresaw evil in every incident.\r\n\r\nNow his hopes were fulfilled, the yearnings of a lifetime realized.\r\nDuring the night a light had been seen, and at 2 o'clock in the morning\r\nland became, beyond all doubt, visible. Then the three little vessels\r\nlaid to, and with the earliest streak of dawn made sail toward the\r\ncoast. A man stood bareheaded on the deck of the leading caravel and\r\nfeasted his eyes upon the wooded shore; the man was Christopher\r\nColumbus, the land he gazed on the \"West Indies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN SALVADOR, OR WATLING'S ISLAND.\r\n\r\nSan Salvador, or Watling's Island, is about twelve miles in length by\r\nsix in breadth, having its interior largely cut up by salt-water\r\nlagoons, separated from each other by low woody hills. Being one of the\r\nmost fertile of the group, it maintains nearly 2,000 inhabitants, who\r\nare scattered about over its surface. Peculiar interest will always\r\nattach itself to this spot as being the first land on which the\r\ndiscoverer of the New World set foot.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY OF THE SHADOWY SEA.\r\n\r\n     XERIF AL EDRISI, surnamed \"The Nubian,\" an eminent Arabian\r\n     geographer.

No one has been able to verify anything concerning\r\nit, on account of its difficult and perilous navigation, its great\r\nobscurity, its profound depth, and frequent tempests; through fear of\r\nits mighty fishes and its haughty winds; yet there are many islands in\r\nit, some peopled, others uninhabited. There is no mariner who dares to\r\nenter into its deep waters; or, if any have done so, they have merely\r\nkept along its coasts, fearful of departing from them. The waves of this\r\nocean, although they roll as high as mountains, yet maintain themselves\r\nwithout breaking, for if they broke it would be impossible for ship to\r\nplow them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALOS.\r\n\r\n     Prof. MAURICE FRANCIS EGAN. From an article, \"Columbus the\r\n     Christ-Bearer,\" in the New York _Independent_, June 2, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe caravels equipped at Palos were so unseaworthy, judged by the\r\ndangers of the Atlantic, that no crew in our time would have trusted in\r\nthem. The people of Palos disliked this foreigner, Columbus. No man of\r\nPalos, except the Pinzons, ancient mariners, sympathized with him in his\r\nhopes. The populace overrated the risks of the voyage; the court,\r\nfortunately for Columbus, underrated them. The Admiral's own ships and\r\nhis crew were not such as to inspire confidence. His friends, the\r\nfriars, had somewhat calmed the popular feeling against the expedition;\r\nbut ungrateful Palos never approved of it until it made her famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n     SAMUEL R.

Houghton, Mifflin & Co.,\r\n     publishers, Boston, and with their permission.\r\n\r\nColumbus at Veragua found plenty of gold; but, leaving the coast, the\r\nship full of one hundred and fifty skillful seamen, some of them old\r\npilots, and with too much experience of their craft and treachery to\r\nhim, the wise Admiral kept his private record of his homeward path. And\r\nwhen he reached Spain, he told the King and Queen, \"That they may ask\r\nall the pilots who came with him, Where is Veragua? Let them answer and\r\nsay, if they know, where Veragua lies. I assert that they can give no\r\nother account than that they went to lands where there was abundance of\r\ngold, but they do not know the way to return thither, but would be\r\nobliged to go on a voyage of discovery as much as if they had never been\r\nthere before.

The departure from Palos,\r\nwhere a few years before he had begged a morsel of bread and a cup of\r\nwater for his way-worn child; his final farewell to the Old World at the\r\nCanaries; his entrance upon the trade-winds, which then for the first\r\ntime filled a European sail; the portentous variation of the needle,\r\nnever before observed; the fearful course westward and westward, day\r\nafter day and night after night, over the unknown ocean; the mutinous\r\nand ill-appeased crew; at length, when hope had turned to despair in\r\nevery heart but one, the tokens of land--the cloud banks on the western\r\nhorizon, the logs of driftwood, the fresh shrub floating with its leaves\r\nand berries, the flocks of land birds, the shoals of fish that inhabit\r\nshallow water, the indescribable smell of the shore; the mysterious\r\npresentment that seems ever to go before a great event; and finally, on\r\nthat ever memorable night of October 12, 1492, the moving light seen by\r\nthe sleepless eye of the great discoverer himself from the deck of the\r\nSanta Maria, and in the morning the real, undoubted land swelling up\r\nfrom the bosom of the deep, with its plains and forests, and hills and\r\nrocks and streams, and strange new races of men.

He\r\nwas the son of a Genoese pilot, a pilot and seaman himself; and, at one\r\nperiod of his melancholy career, was reduced to beg his bread at the\r\ndoors of the convents in Spain. But he carried within himself, and\r\nbeneath a humble exterior, a _spirit_ for which there was not room in\r\nSpain, in Europe, nor in the then known world; and which led him on to a\r\nheight of usefulness and fame beyond that of all the monarchs that ever\r\nreigned.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIFLING INCIDENT.\r\n\r\n     The Venerable FREDERIC WILLIAM FARRAR, D. D., F. R. S., Archdeacon\r\n     of Westminster. Born in Bombay, August 7, 1831. From his \"Lectures\r\n     and Addresses.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some who are fond of looking at the apparently trifling\r\nincidents of history, and of showing how the stream of centuries has\r\nbeen diverted in one or other direction by events the most\r\ninsignificant. General Garfield told his pupils at Hiram that the roof\r\nof a certain court house was so absolute a watershed that the flutter\r\nof a bird's wing would be sufficient to decide whether a particular\r\nrain-drop should make its way into the Gulf of St. Lawrence or into the\r\nGulf of Mexico. The flutter of a bird's wing may have affected all\r\nhistory. Some students may see an immeasurable significance in the\r\nflight of parrots, which served to alter the course of Columbus, and\r\nguided him to the discovery of North and not of South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCITEMENT AT THE NEWS OF THE DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n     JOHN FISKE, a justly celebrated American historian. Born at\r\n     Hartford, Conn., March 30, 1842. From \"The Discovery of\r\n     America.\"[37]\r\n\r\nIt was generally assumed without question that the Admiral's theory of\r\nhis discovery must be correct, that the coast of Cuba must be the\r\neastern extremity of China, that the coast of Hispaniola must be the\r\nnorthern extremity of Cipango, and that a direct route--much shorter\r\nthan that which Portugal had so long been seeking--had now been found to\r\nthose lands of illimitable wealth described by Marco Polo. To be sure,\r\nColumbus had not as yet seen the evidences of this oriental splendor,\r\nand had been puzzled at not finding them, but he felt confident that he\r\nhad come very near them and would come full upon them in a second\r\nvoyage. There was nobody who knew enough to refute these opinions, and\r\nreally why should not this great geographer, who had accomplished so\r\nmuch already which people had scouted as impossible--why should he not\r\nknow what he was about? It was easy enough now to get men and money for\r\nthe second voyage. When the Admiral sailed from Cadiz on September 25,\r\n1493, it was with seventeen ships, carrying 1,500 men. Their dreams were\r\nof the marble palaces of Quinsay, of isles of spices, and the treasures\r\nof Prester John. The sovereigns wept for joy as they thought that such\r\nuntold riches were vouchsafed them, by the special decree of Heaven, as\r\na reward for having overcome the Moors at Granada and banished the Jews\r\nfrom Spain. Columbus shared these views, and regarded himself as a\r\nspecial instrument for executing the divine decrees. He renewed his vow\r\nto rescue the Holy Sepulcher, promising within the next seven years to\r\nequip at his own expense a crusading army of 50,000 foot and 4,000\r\nhorse; within five years thereafter he would follow this with a second\r\narmy of like dimensions.\r\n\r\nThus nobody had the faintest suspicion of what had been done. In the\r\nfamous letter to Santangel there is of course not a word about a new\r\nworld. The grandeur of the achievement was quite beyond the ken of the\r\ngeneration that witnessed it. For we have since come to learn that in\r\n1492 the contact between the eastern and the western halves of our\r\nplanet was first really begun, and the two streams of human life which\r\nhad flowed on for countless ages, apart, were thenceforth to mingle\r\ntogether. The first voyage of Columbus is thus a unique event in the\r\nhistory of mankind. Nothing like it was ever done before, and nothing\r\nlike it can ever be done again. No worlds are left for a future Columbus\r\nto conquer. The era of which this great Italian mariner was the most\r\nillustrious representative has closed forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nVINLAND.\r\n\r\n     JOHN FISKE, an American historian. Born in Connecticut, 1842. From\r\n     \"Washington and his Country.\"[38]\r\n\r\nLearned men had long known that the earth is round, but people generally\r\ndid not believe it, and it had not occurred to anybody that such a\r\nvoyage would be practicable. People were afraid of going too far out\r\ninto the ocean. A ship which disappears in the offing seems to be going\r\ndown hill; and many people thought that if they were to get too far\r\ndown hill, they could not get back. Other notions, as absurd as this,\r\nwere entertained, which made people dread the \"Sea of Darkness,\" as the\r\nAtlantic was often called. Accordingly, Columbus found it hard to get\r\nsupport for his scheme.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen years before his first voyage, Columbus seems to have\r\nvisited Iceland, and some have supposed that he then heard about the\r\nvoyages of the Northmen, and was thus led to his belief that land would\r\nbe found by sailing west. He may have thus heard about Vinland, and may\r\nhave regarded the tale as confirming his theory. That theory, however,\r\nwas based upon his belief in the rotundity of the earth. The best proof\r\nthat he was not seriously influenced by the Norse voyages, even if he\r\nhad heard of them, is the fact that he never used them as an argument.\r\nIn persuading people to furnish money for his enterprise, it has been\r\nwell said that an ounce of Vinland would have been worth a pound of talk\r\nabout the shape of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICAL DAYS.\r\n\r\n     JOHN MILNER FOTHERGILL, M. D., an English physician. Born at\r\n     Morland in Westmoreland, April 11, 1841; died, 1888.\r\n\r\nColumbus was an Italian who possessed all that determination which came\r\nof Norse blood combined with the subtlety of the Italian character. He\r\nthought much of what the ancients said of a short course from Spain to\r\nIndia, of Plato's Atlantic Island; and conceived the idea of sailing to\r\nIndia over the Atlantic. He applied to the Genoese, who rejected his\r\nscheme as impracticable; then to Portugal; then to Spain. The fall of\r\nGranada led to his ultimate success; and at last he set out into the\r\nunknown sea with a small fleet, which was so ill-formed as scarcely to\r\nreach the Canaries in safety. Soon after leaving them, the spirits of\r\nhis crew fell, and then Columbus perceived that the art of governing the\r\nminds of men would be no less requisite for accomplishing the\r\ndiscoveries he had in view than naval skill and undaunted courage. He\r\ncould trust himself only. He regulated everything by his sole authority;\r\nhe superintended the execution of every order. As he went farther\r\nwestward the hearts of his crew failed them, and mutiny was imminent.\r\nBut Columbus retained his serenity of mind even under these trying\r\ncircumstances, and induced his crew to persevere for three days more.\r\nThree critical days in the history of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APPROPRIATE HOUR.\r\n\r\n     JOHN FOSTER, a noted English essayist and moralist.

Born at\r\n     Harborne, Staffordshire, 1823; died at Alicante, Spain, March 16,\r\n     1892. From an article on \"The Intellectual Development of the\r\n     English People,\" in the _Chautauquan Magazine_, May, 1891.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a new world was something so startling as to help very\r\npowerfully in the general enlargement of men's minds. And the phrase of\r\na new world is fully justified. The discovery of a western continent,\r\nwhich followed on the voyage of Columbus, was an event differing in kind\r\nfrom any discovery that had ever been made before. And this though there\r\nis little reason to doubt that the western continent itself had been\r\ndiscovered before. The Northmen had certainly found their way to the\r\nreal continent of North America ages before Columbus found his way to\r\nthe West India Islands. But the same results did not come of it, and the\r\ndiscovery itself was not of the same kind. The Old World had grown a\r\ngood deal before the discovery of the New. The range of men's thoughts\r\nand enterprise had gradually spread from the Mediterranean to the\r\nAtlantic, the Baltic, and the northern seas. To advance from Norway to\r\nthe islands north of Britain, thence to Iceland, Greenland, and the\r\nAmerican continent, was a gradual process. The great feature in the\r\nlasting discovery of America, which began at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, was its suddenness. Nothing led to it; it was made by an\r\naccident; men were seeking one thing and then found another. Nothing\r\nlike it has happened before or since.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIDAY.\r\n\r\n     Of evil omen for the ancients. For America the day of glad tidings\r\n     and glorious deeds.\r\n\r\nFriday, the sixth day of the week, has for ages borne the obloquy of\r\nodium and ill-luck. Friday, October 5th, B. C. 105, was marked\r\n_nefastus_ in the Roman calendar because on that day Marcus Mallius and\r\nCæpio the Consul were slain and their whole army annihilated in Gallia\r\nNarbonensis by the Cimbrians. It was considered a very unlucky day in\r\nSpain and Italy; it is still deemed an ill-starred day among the\r\nBuddhists and Brahmins. The reason given by Christians for its ill-luck\r\nis, of course, because it was the day of Christ's crucifixion, though\r\none would hardly term that an \"unlucky event\" for Christians. A Friday\r\nmoon is considered unlucky for weather. It is the Mohammedan Sabbath and\r\nwas the day on which Adam was created. The Sabeans consecrated it to\r\nVenus or Astarte. According to mediæval romance, on this day fairies\r\nand all the tribes of elves of every description were converted into\r\nhideous animals and remained so until Monday. In Scotland it is a great\r\nday for weddings. In England it is not. Sir William Churchill says,\r\n\"Friday is my lucky day. I was born, christened, married, and knighted\r\non that day, and all my best accidents have befallen me on a Friday.\"\r\nAurungzebe considered Friday a lucky day and used to say in prayer, \"Oh,\r\nthat I may die on a Friday, for blessed is he that dies on that day.\"\r\nBritish popular saying terms a trial, misfortune, or cross a \"Friday\r\ntree,\" from the \"accursed tree\" on which the Savior was crucified on\r\nthat day. Stow, the historian of London, states that \"Friday Street\" was\r\nso called because it was the street of fish merchants who served the\r\nFriday markets. In the Roman Catholic church Friday is a fast day, and\r\nis considered an unlucky day because it was the day of Christ's\r\ncrucifixion. Soames (\"Anglo-Saxon Church,\" page 255) says of it, \"Adam\r\nand Eve ate the forbidden fruit on Friday and died on Friday.\" Shakspere\r\nrefers to the ill-omened nature of the day as follows: \"The duke, I say\r\nto thee again, would eat mutton Friday\" (\"Measure for Measure,\" Act 3,\r\nScene 2).\r\n\r\nBut to turn to the more pleasing side, great has been the good fortune\r\nof the land of freedom on this ill-starred day. On Friday, August 3,\r\n1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from the port of Palos on his great\r\nvoyage of discovery. On Friday, October 12, 1492, he discovered land; on\r\nFriday, January 4, 1493, he sailed on his return voyage to Spain. On\r\nFriday, March 14, 1493, he arrived at Palos, Spain, in safety. On\r\nFriday, November 22, 1493, he arrived at Española on his second voyage\r\nto America. On Friday, June 12, 1494, he discovered the mainland of\r\nAmerica. On Friday, March 5, 1496, Henry VIII. gave John Cabot his\r\ncommission to pursue the discovery of America. On Friday, September 7,\r\n1565, Melendez founded St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest town in the\r\nUnited States. On Friday, November 10, 1620, the Mayflower, with the\r\nPilgrim Fathers, reached the harbor of Provincetown. On Friday, December\r\n22, 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth Rock. On Friday,\r\nFebruary 22, 1732, George Washington was born. On Friday, June 16, 1755,\r\nBunker Hill was seized and fortified. On Friday, October 17, 1777,\r\nBurgoyne surrendered at Saratoga. On Friday, September 22, 1780,\r\nBenedict Arnold's treason was discovered. On Friday, September 19, 1791,\r\nLord Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. On Friday, July 7, 1776, a\r\nmotion was made by John Adams that \"the United States are and ought to\r\nbe independent.\" On Friday, July 13, 1866, the Great Eastern steamship\r\nsailed from Valentia, Ireland, with the second and successful Atlantic\r\ncable, and completed the laying of this link of our civilization at\r\nHeart's Content, Newfoundland, on Friday, July 27, 1866. In Spanish\r\nhistory it is noteworthy that on Friday the Christians under Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella had won Granada from the Moors. On a Friday, also, the\r\nFirst Crusaders, under Geoffrey de Bouillon, took Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PREVIOUS DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n     PAUL GAFFAREL. Summarized from \"Les Découvreurs Français du XIVme\r\n     au XVIme Siècle,\" published at Paris in 1888.\r\n\r\nJean Cousin, in 1488, sailed from Dieppe, then the great commercial and\r\nnaval port of France, and bore out to sea, to avoid the storms so\r\nprevalent in the Bay of Biscay. Arrived at the latitude of the Azores,\r\nhe was carried westward by a current, and came to an unknown country\r\nnear the mouth of an immense river. He took possession of the\r\ncontinent, but, as he had not sufficient crew nor material resources\r\nadequate for founding a settlement, he re-embarked. Instead of returning\r\ndirectly to Dieppe, he took a southeasterly direction--that is, toward\r\nSouth Africa--discovered the cape which has since retained the name of\r\nCap des Aiguilles (Cape Agulhas, the southern point of Africa), went\r\nnorth by the Congo and Guinea, and returned to Dieppe in 1489. Cousin's\r\nlieutenant was a Castilian, Pinzon by name, who was jealous of his\r\ncaptain, and caused him considerable trouble on the Gold Coast. On\r\nCousin's complaint, the admiralty declared him unfit to serve in the\r\nmarine of Dieppe. Pinzon then retired to Genoa, and afterward to\r\nCastille. Every circumstance tends toward the belief that this is the\r\nsame Pinzon to whom Columbus afterward intrusted the command of the\r\nPinta.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENIUS TRAVELS EAST TO WEST.\r\n\r\n     The Abbé FERNANDO GALIANI, an Italian political economist. Born at\r\n     Chieti, on the Abruzzi, 1728; died at Naples, 1787.\r\n\r\nFor five thousand years genius has turned opposite to the diurnal\r\nmotion, and traveled from east to west.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATION LIKE COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. CUNNINGHAM GEIKIE, D. D., a noted English clergyman. Born\r\n     at Edinborough, October 26, 1826.\r\n\r\nReading should be a Columbus voyage, in which nothing passes without\r\nnote and speculation; the Sargasso Sea, mistaken for the New Indies; the\r\nbranch with the fresh berries; the carved pole; the currents; the color\r\nof the water; the birds; the odor of the land; the butterflies; the\r\nmoving light on the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENOA INSCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nThe following inscription is placed upon Columbus' house, No. 37, in the\r\nVico Dritto Ponticello, Genoa, Italy:\r\n\r\n  _NVLLA. DOMVS. TITVLO. DIGNIOR.\r\n  HAEIC.\r\n  PATERNIS. IN. AEDIBVS.\r\n  CHRISTOPHVS. COLVMBVS.\r\n  PRIMAQVE. JVVENTAM. TRANSEGIT._\r\n\r\n  (No house deserved better an inscription.\r\n  This is the paternal home of Christopher Columbus, where\r\n  he passed his childhood and youth.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENOA STATUE.\r\n\r\n\"Genoa and Venice,\" writes Mr. Oscar Browning, in _Picturesque Europe_,\r\n\"have much in common--both republics, both aristocracies, both\r\ncommercial, both powerful maritime states; yet, while the Doge of Venice\r\nremains to us as the embodiment of stately and majestic pre-eminence, we\r\nscarcely remember, or have forgotten, that there ever was a Doge of\r\nGenoa. This surely can not be because Shakspere did not write of the\r\nBank of St. George or because Genoa has no Rialto. It must be rather\r\nbecause, while Genoa devoted herself to the pursuits of riches and\r\nmagnificence, Venice fought the battle of Europe against barbarism, and\r\nrecorded her triumphs in works of art which will live forever. * * *\r\nGenoa has no such annals and no such art. As we wander along the narrow\r\nstreets we see the courtyards of many palaces, the marble stairs, the\r\ngraceful _loggia_, the terraces and the arches of which stand out\r\nagainst an Italian sky; but we look in vain for the magnificence of\r\npublic halls, where the brush of Tintoretto or Carpaccio decorated the\r\nassembly-room of the rulers of the East or the chapter-house of a\r\ncharitable fraternity.\"\r\n\r\nThe artistic monument of Columbus, situated in the Piazza Acquaverde,\r\nfacing the railway station, consists of a marble statue fitly embowered\r\namid tropical palms, and is composed of a huge quadrangular pedestal, at\r\nthe angles of which are seated allegorical figures of Religion,\r\nGeography, Strength, and Wisdom. Resting on this pedestal is a large\r\ncylindrical pedestal decorated with three ships' prows, on which stands\r\na colossal figure of Columbus, his left hand resting on an anchor. At\r\nhis feet, in a half-sitting, half-kneeling posture, is an allegorical\r\nfigure of America in the act of adoring a crucifix, which she holds in\r\nher right hand. The four bas-reliefs on the sides of the pedestal\r\nrepresent the most important events in the life of the great discoverer:\r\n(1) Columbus before the Council of Salamanca; (2) Columbus taking formal\r\npossession of the New World; (3) his flattering reception at the court\r\nof Ferdinand and Isabella; (4) Columbus in chains. It is as well that\r\nthis, the saddest of episodes, should be remembered, because great\r\nactions are as often as not emphasized by martyrdom.\r\n\r\nThe first stone of the monument was laid September 27, 1846, and the\r\ncompleted statue formally dedicated in 1862. It bears the laconic but\r\nexpressive dedication: \"_A Cristoforo Colombo, La Patria_\" (The Nation\r\nto Christopher Columbus).\r\n\r\nGenoa claims, with the largest presumption of truth, that Christopher\r\nColumbus was born there. The best of historical and antiquarian research\r\ntends to show that in a house, No. 37, in the Vico Dritto Ponticello,\r\nlived Domenico Colombo, the father of Christopher, and that in this\r\nhouse the Great Admiral was born. In 1887 the Genoese municipality\r\nbought the house, and an inscription has been placed over the door. To\r\ngive the exact date of Christopher's birth is, however, difficult, but\r\nit is believed to have occurred sometime between March 15, 1446, and\r\nMarch 20, 1447.\r\n\r\nWhether Columbus was actually a native of Genoa or of Cogoletto--the\r\nlatter is a sequestered little town a few miles west of the former--must\r\never remain a matter of conjecture. True enough, the house in which his\r\nfather followed the trade of a wool-carder in Genoa is eagerly pointed\r\nout to a stranger; but the inscription on the marble tablet over the\r\nentrance does not state that the future discoverer was really born in\r\nit. This stands in a narrow alley designated the Vico di Morcento, near\r\nthe prison of San Andrea.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the little town hall at Cogoletto contains a portrait\r\nof Columbus, more than 300 years old, whose frame is completely covered\r\nwith the names of enthusiastic travelers. The room in which he is\r\nbelieved to have been born resembles a cellar rather than aught else;\r\nwhile the broken pavement shows how visitors have at various times taken\r\nup the bricks to preserve as relics. As if this undoubted evidence of\r\nhero worship were insufficient, the old woman in charge of the place\r\nhastens to relate how a party of Americans one day lifted the original\r\ndoor off its hinges and carried it bodily away between them.\r\n\r\nAs all the world knows, Columbus died at Valladolid on the 20th of May,\r\n1506. It has always been a matter of intense regret to the Genoese that\r\nhis body should have been permitted to be shipped across the seas to its\r\nfirst resting-place in San Domingo. More fortunate, however, were they\r\nin securing the remains of their modern kinsman and national patriot,\r\nMazzini.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of May, 1892, under the auspices of Ligurian Gymnastic\r\nSociety Cristofore Columbo, a bronze wreath was placed at the base of\r\nthe Columbus monument.\r\n\r\nThe Ligurian Gymnastic Society Cristofore Columbo is an association\r\nwhich cultivates athletic exercises, music, and, above all, patriotism\r\nand charity. To awaken popular interest in the coming exhibition, the\r\nsociety had a bronze wreath made by the well-known sculptor Burlando,\r\nand fitting ceremonies took place, with a procession through the\r\nstreets, before affixing the wreath at the base of the monument. The\r\nwreath, which weighed some 500 pounds, was carried by a figure\r\nrepresenting Genoa seated on a triumphal car. There were 7,000 members\r\nof the society present, with not less than fifty bands of music. The\r\nceremonies, beginning at 10 A. M., were concluded at 4 P. M. The last\r\nact was a hymn, sung by 2,000 voices, with superb effect. Then, by means\r\nof machinery, the bronze crown was put in its proper position. Never was\r\nGenoa in a gayer humor, nor could the day have been more propitious. The\r\nstreets were decorated with flowers and banners. There were\r\nrepresentatives from Rome, Florence, Milan, Turin, Venice, Naples,\r\nLeghorn, Palermo, and visitors from all parts of Europe and America. In\r\nthe evening only did the festivities close with a grand dinner given by\r\nthe Genoese municipality.\r\n\r\nIn this, the glorification of the grand old city of Liguria, was united\r\nthat of its most memorable man, Christopher Columbus, for that mediæval\r\nfeeling, when cities had almost individual personalities, is still a\r\ncivic sense alive in Genoa. She rejoices in the illustrious men born\r\nwithin her walls with a sentiment akin to that of a mother for her son.\r\n\r\nIn an artistic sense, nothing could have been more complete than this\r\nfestival. Throwing the eye upward, beyond the figure of Columbus, the\r\nframe is perfect. The slanting ways leading up to the handsome houses on\r\nthe background are wonderfully effective.\r\n\r\nGenoa is rich in the relics of Columbus. In the city hall of Genoa is,\r\namong other relics, a mosaic portrait of the Admiral, somewhat modified\r\nfrom the De Bry's Columbus. Genoa is fortunate in possessing a number of\r\nauthentic letters of Columbus, and these are preserved in a marble\r\ncustodia, surmounted by a head of Columbus. In the pillar which forms\r\nthe pedestal there is a bronze door, and the precious Columbus documents\r\nhave been placed there.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY AND COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nThe Geographical Society of Germany will shortly publish a volume\r\ncommemorative of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by\r\nColumbus, which will, it is said, be one of the most elaborate\r\npublications ever issued by the society. Dr. Konrad Kretschmer, the\r\neditor of the forthcoming work, has visited all the principal libraries\r\nof Italy in search of material, and has had access to many rare\r\nmanuscripts hitherto unused. The memorial volume will contain forty-five\r\nmaps relating to the discovery of America, thirty-one of which are said\r\nto have never been published. Emperor William has contributed 15,000\r\nmarks toward the expenses of publication, etc., and the work will\r\nundoubtedly be a most valuable contribution to the early history of\r\nAmerica. It is expected that it will leave the government printing\r\noffice early in August.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY'S EXHIBIT OF RARITIES.\r\n\r\nGermany proposes to loan a collection of Columbus rarities to the United\r\nStates Government for exhibition at the Chicago Exposition, as will be\r\nseen by a communication to the State Department from Consul-general\r\nEdwards at Berlin. In his document, Mr. Edwards says:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF COLUMBUS. No. 37 Vico Dritto Ponticelli, Genoa,\r\nItaly. (See page 140.)]\r\n\r\nThe German government, appreciating the fact that no time is to be lost\r\nin this matter, has begun to carry its generous and friendly proposals\r\ninto practical operation by instituting a thorough search in the various\r\ngalleries, museums, and libraries throughout Germany for works of\r\nart, objects, and rarities which are in any way identified with the\r\nColumbus period, and which the German government believes would be\r\nlikely to be of general interest to the authorities of the World's\r\nColumbian Exposition as well as the visitors at that great show.\r\n\r\nAmong other works of art the German government consents to loan\r\nPludderman's celebrated painting, \"The Discovery of America by\r\nColumbus.\" Under the laws of Germany, as well as under the rules and\r\nregulations of the National Gallery, no person is permitted to\r\nlithograph, photograph, or make any sort of a copy of any picture or\r\nother work of art in the care or custody of any national gallery, in\r\ncase when the artist has not been dead for a period of thirty years,\r\nwithout having first obtained the written permission of the legal\r\nrepresentative of the deceased artist, coupled with the consent of the\r\nNational Gallery authorities. Pludderman not having been dead thirty\r\nyears, I have given assurances that this regulation will be observed by\r\nthe United States Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REASON FOR SAILORS' SUPERSTITIONS.\r\n\r\n     His Eminence JAMES GIBBONS, D.D., a celebrated American\r\n     ecclesiastic. Born in Baltimore, Md., July 23, 1834.\r\n\r\nThere is but a plank between a sailor and eternity, and perhaps the\r\nrealization of that fact may have something to do with the superstition\r\nlurking in his nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nONCE THE PILLARS OF HERCULES WERE THE END OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GIBSON.\r\n\r\n  Thus opening on that glooming sea,\r\n    Well seemed these walls[39] the ends of earth;\r\n  Death and a dark eternity\r\n    Sublimely symboled forth!\r\n\r\n  Ere to one eagle soul was given\r\n    The will, the wings, that deep to brave;\r\n  In the sun's path to find a heaven,\r\n    A New World--o'er the wave.\r\n\r\n  Retraced the path Columbus trod,\r\n    Our course was from the setting sun;\r\n  While all the visible works of God,\r\n    Though various else had one.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW LIGHT ON CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     From the Glasgow _Times_.\r\n\r\nThe discovery by the Superintendent of the Military Archives at Madrid\r\nof documents probably setting at rest the doubts that formerly existed\r\nas to the birthplace of Columbus, must have awakened new interest in the\r\nhistory of the most renowned discoverer of the past. It is to be noted,\r\nhowever, that the documents only affirm tradition, for Genoa has always\r\nbeen the Admiral's accredited birthplace. But if the discovery should\r\nlead to nothing but a more careful investigation of the records of his\r\nlater history it will have been of use.\r\n\r\nThe character of Columbus has been greatly misunderstood, and his 600\r\nbiographers have in turn invested him with the glory of the religious\r\nhero and the contumely of the ill-tempered and crack-brained adventurer.\r\nAn impartial critic must admit, indeed, that he was something of both,\r\nthough more of the hero than the adventurer, and that his biographers\r\nhave erred considerably in what Mr. R. L. Stevenson would call their\r\n\"point of view.\"\r\n\r\nEducated, as it is supposed, in the local schools of Genoa, and for a\r\nshort period at the University of Pavia, the youthful Columbus must have\r\ncome in close contact with the scholars of the day. Naturally of a\r\nreligious temperament, the piety of the learned would early impress him,\r\nand to this may possibly be attributed the feeling that he had been\r\ndivinely selected, which remained with him until his death.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that he began his career as a sailor, at the age\r\nof fourteen, with the sole object of plunder. The Indies were the\r\nconstant attraction for the natives of Venice and Genoa; the\r\nMediterranean and the Adriatic were filled with treasure ships. In these\r\ncircumstances it is not to be wondered that the sea possessed a\r\nwonderful fascination for the youth of those towns. This opulence was\r\nthe constant envy of Spain and Portugal, and Columbus was soon attracted\r\nto the latter country by the desire of Prince Henry to discover a\r\nsouthern route to the Indies. It was while in Portugal that he began to\r\nbelieve that his mission on earth was to be the discoverer of a new\r\nroute to the land of gold--\"the white man's god.\" For two years he\r\nresided in Lisbon, from time to time making short voyages, but for the\r\nmost part engaged drawing maps to procure himself a living. Here he\r\nmarried, here his son Diego was born, and here his wife, who died at an\r\nearly age, was buried.\r\n\r\nToscanelli at this time advanced the theory that the earth was round,\r\nand Columbus at once entered into correspondence with him on the\r\nsubject, and was greatly impressed with the views of the Florentine\r\nscientist, both as to the sphericity of the world and the wonders of the\r\nAsiatic region. Heresy-hunting was then a favorite pastime, and\r\nColumbus in accepting these theories ran no small risk of losing his\r\nlife. Portugal and France in turn rejected his offers to add to their\r\ndependencies by his discoveries; and, though his brother found many in\r\nEngland willing to give him the necessary ships to start on his\r\nadventures, Spain, after much importuning on the part of the explorer,\r\nforestalled our own country.\r\n\r\nThen followed his four eventful voyages with all their varying fortunes,\r\nand his death, when over seventy years of age, in a wretched condition\r\nof poverty. The ready consideration of theories, not only dangerous but\r\nso astounding in their character as to throw discredit on those who\r\nadvanced them, shows him to have been a man of intellectual courage.\r\nHumility was another trait of his character, and in all his life it can\r\nnot be said that he acted in any but an honest and straightforward\r\nmanner toward his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nIt is true, no doubt, that his recognition of slavery somewhat dims his\r\nreputation. He sold many Indians as slaves, but it should be remembered\r\nthat slavery prevailed at the time, and it was only on his second\r\nvoyage, when hard pressed for means to reimburse the Spanish treasury\r\nfor the immense expense of the expedition, that he resorted to the\r\nbarter in human flesh. Indeed, his friendly relations with the natives\r\nshow that, as a rule, he must have treated them in the kindly manner\r\nwhich characterized all his actions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the reverses of his long career, whether received with\r\nsneers, lauded as a benefactor of his country, put in chains by crafty\r\nfellow-subjects, or defrauded, by an unscrupulous prince, of the profit\r\nof his discoveries, he continued a man of an eminently lovable\r\ncharacter, kind to his family, his servants, and even his enemies.\r\nAmericans are to do honor at the Columbian Exhibition to the name of him\r\nwho, though not the first white man to land on the shores of the New\r\nWorld, was the first to colonize its fertile islands. Not only America,\r\nbut the whole world, may emulate his virtues with advantage; for, even\r\nnow, justice and mercy, courage and meekness, do not always abide\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRET.\r\n\r\n     FRANK B. GOODRICH, an American author of several popular books.\r\n     Born in Boston, 1826. From his \"History of the Sea.\"\r\n\r\nJohn II. of Portugal applied for an increase of power, and obtained a\r\ngrant of all the lands which his navigators could discover in sailing\r\n_from west to east_. The grand idea of sailing from east to west--one\r\nwhich implied a knowledge of the sphericity of the globe--had not yet,\r\nto outward appearance, penetrated the brain of either pope or layman.\r\nOne Christopher Columbus, however, was already brooding over it in\r\nsecret and in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD.\r\n\r\n     FRANÇOIS PIERRE GUILLAUME GUIZOT, a distinguished French statesman\r\n     and historian. Born at Nîmes, October 4, 1787; died September 12,\r\n     1874. From his \"History of Civilization\" (5 vols., 1845).\r\n\r\nThe period in question was also one of the most remarkable for the\r\ndisplay of physical activity among men. It was a period of voyages,\r\ntravels, enterprises, discoveries, and inventions of every kind. It was\r\nthe time of the great Portuguese expedition along the coast of Africa;\r\nof the discovery of the new passage to India, by Vasco de Gama; of the\r\ndiscovery of America, by Christopher Columbus; of the wonderful\r\nextension of European commerce. A thousand new inventions started up;\r\nothers already known, but confined within a narrow sphere, became\r\npopular and in general use. Gunpowder changed the system of war; the\r\ncompass changed the system of navigation. Painting in oil was invented,\r\nand filled Europe with masterpieces of art. Engraving on copper,\r\ninvented in 1406, multiplied and diffused them. Paper made of linen\r\nbecame common. Finally, between 1436 and 1452, was invented\r\nprinting--printing, the theme of so many declamations and commonplaces,\r\nbut to whose merits and effect no commonplaces or declamations will ever\r\nbe able to do justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORNING TRIUMPHANT.\r\n\r\n     Rev. F. W. GUNSAULUS, D. D., an American divine and able pulpit\r\n     orator; at present, pastor of Plymouth Church, Chicago. From \"New\r\n     Testament and Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nLook again! It has become so light now that it is easy to see. Yonder in\r\nthe West a man has been pleading before courts, praying to God,\r\nthinking, and dreaming. His brave heart sends forth hot tears, but it\r\nwill not fail. The genius of God has seized him. The Holy Ghost has\r\ntouched him as the spirit of liberty. Humanity cries through him for\r\nmore room. Emperors will not hear. But he gains one ear, at last, and\r\nwith the mariner's needle set out for the unknown. Civilization has\r\nalways walked by faith and not by sight. And do not forget to note,\r\nthat, in that log-book, the first mark is, \"In the name of our Lord\r\nJesus Christ.\" On! brave man, on! over wastes of ocean, in the midst of\r\nscorn, through hate, rage, mutiny, even death--and despair, worse than\r\ndeath. On! there is an America on the other side to balance. Cheerless\r\nnights, sad days, nights dark with woe, days hideous with the form of\r\ndeath, weeks sobbing with pity; but in that heart is He whose name is\r\nwritten in the log-book. \"Land ahead!\" And Columbus has discovered a\r\ncontinent. Humanity has another world. Light from the four corners of\r\nheaven. Glory touching firmament and planet. It is morning! Triumphant,\r\nbeautiful dawn!\r\n\r\n\r\nTENDENCY.\r\n\r\n     ARNOLD HENRY GUYOT, Ph. D., LL. D., a meritorious writer on\r\n     physical geography. Born near Neufchâtel, Switzerland, 1807.\r\n     Professor of geology and physical geography at Princeton College\r\n     from 1855 until his death, February 8, 1884. From \"Earth and Man\"\r\n     (1849).\r\n\r\nAs the plant is made for the animal, as the vegetable world is made for\r\nthe animal world, America is made for the man of the Old World. The man\r\nof the Old World sets out upon his way. Leaving the highlands of Asia,\r\nhe descends from station to station toward Europe. Each of his steps is\r\nmarked by a new civilization superior to the preceding, by a greater\r\npower of development. Arrived at the Atlantic, he pauses on the shore of\r\nthis unknown ocean, the bounds of which he knows not, and turns upon his\r\nfootprints for an instant; then recommences his adventurous career\r\nwestward as in the earliest ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW LIFE.\r\n\r\n     EDWARD EVERETT HALE, D. D., a celebrated American author. Born in\r\n     Boston, Mass., April 3, 1822. From an article, \"Christopher\r\n     Columbus,\" in the _Independent_, June 2, 1892.\r\n\r\nWhat the world owes to him and to Isabella, who made his work possible,\r\nit is impossible in few words to say. The moment was one when Europe\r\nneeded America as never before. She had new life, given by the fall of\r\nConstantinople, by the invention of printing, by the expulsion of the\r\nMoors; there was new life even seething in the first heats of the\r\nReformation; and Europe must break her bonds, else she would die. Her\r\noutlet was found in America. Here it is that that Power who orders\r\nhistory could try, on a fit scale, the great experiments of the new\r\nlife. Thus it was ordered, let us say reverently, that South America\r\nshould show what the Catholic church could do in the line of civilizing\r\na desert, and that North America should show what the coming church of\r\nthe future could do. To us it is interesting to remember that Columbus\r\npersonally led the first discovery of South America, and that he made\r\nthe first effort for a colony on our half of the continent. Of these two\r\nexperiments the North America of to-day and South America of to-day are\r\nthe issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIUMPH OF AN IDEA.\r\n\r\nThe life of Columbus is an illustration constantly brought for the\r\nsuccess which God gives to those who, having conceived of a great idea,\r\nbravely determine to carry it through. His singleness of purpose, his\r\ndetermination to succeed, have been cited for four centuries, and will\r\nbe cited for centuries more among the noblest illustrations which\r\nhistory has given of success wrought out by the courage of one\r\nman.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EAST LONGED FOR THE WEST.\r\n\r\n    EDWARD EVERETT HALE, in _Overland Monthly Magazine_. An article on\r\n    \"A Visit to Palos.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Houghton, following Freiligrath, has sung to us how the\r\n\r\n  Palm tree dreameth of the pine,\r\n  The pine tree of the palm;\r\n\r\nand in his delicate imaginings the dream is of two continents--ocean\r\nparted--each of which longs for the other. Strange enough, as one pushes\r\nalong the steep ascent from the landing at Rábida, up the high bluff on\r\nwhich the convent stands, the palm tree and the pine grow together, as\r\nin token of the dream of the great discoverer, who was to unite the\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE FOR LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n     FITZ-GREENE HALLECK, a noted American poet. Born in Guilford,\r\n     Conn., July 8, 1790; died November 19, 1867.\r\n\r\n  Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,\r\n  And in its hollow tones are heard\r\n    The thanks of millions yet to be.\r\n  Come when his task of fame is wrought,\r\n  Come with her laurel-leaf, blood-bought,\r\n    Come in her crowning hour, and then\r\n  Thy sunken eye's unearthly light\r\n  To him is welcome as the sight\r\n    Of sky and stars to prison'd men;\r\n  Thy grasp is welcome as the hand\r\n  Of brother in a foreign land;\r\n  Thy summons welcome as the cry\r\n  That told the Indian isles were nigh\r\n    To the world-seeking Genoese,\r\n  When the land wind, from woods of palm,\r\n  And orange groves, and fields of balm,\r\n    Blew o'er the Haytian seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENOA.\r\n\r\n     MURAT HALSTEAD, an American journalist. Born at Ross, Ohio,\r\n     September 2, 1829. From \"Genoa--the Home of Columbus,\" a paper in\r\n     _Cosmopolitan_, May, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe Italian coast all around the Gulf of Genoa is mountainous, and the\r\nmountains crowd each other almost into the sea. Land that can be built\r\nupon or cultivated is scarce, and the narrow strips that are possible\r\nare on the sunny southern slopes. The air is delicious. The orange trees\r\nin December lean over the garden walls, heavy with golden spheres, and\r\nthe grass is green on the hills, and when a light snow falls the roses\r\nblush through the soft veil of lace, and are modest but not ashamed, as\r\nthey bow their heads. The mountains are like a wall of iron against the\r\nworld, and from them issues a little river whose waters are pure as the\r\ndew, until the washerwomen use them and spread clothing on the wide\r\nspaces of clean gravel to dry. The harbor is easily defended, and with\r\nthe same expensive equipment would be strong as Gibraltar. It is in this\r\nisolation that the individuality of Genoa, stamped upon so many chapters\r\nof world-famous history, grew. There is so little room for a city that\r\nthe buildings are necessarily lofty. The streets are narrow and steep.\r\nThe pavements are blocks of stone that would average from two to three\r\nfeet in length, one foot in width, and of unknown depth. Evidently they\r\nare not constructed for any temporary purpose, but to endure forever.\r\nWhen, for a profound reason, a paving-stone is taken up it is speedily\r\nreplaced, with the closest attention to exact restoration, and then it\r\nis again a rock of ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CELEBRATION AT HAMBURG.\r\n\r\nAmong the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of\r\nAmerica, that of the city of Hamburg, in Germany, will occupy a\r\nprominent place. On October 1st an exhibition will be opened at which\r\nobjects will be on view that bear on the history of the act of\r\ndiscovery, on the condition of geographical science of the time, and on\r\nthe conditions of the inhabitants of America at the time of the\r\ndiscovery. Side by side with these will be exhibited whatever can show\r\nthe condition of America at the present time. On the date of the\r\ndiscovery of the little Island of Guanahani--that is, October 12th--the\r\ncelebration proper will take place. The exercises will consist of songs\r\nand music and a goodly array of speeches. In the evening, tableaux and\r\nprocessions will be performed in the largest hall of the city. The\r\nscenery, costumes, and implements used will all be got up as they were\r\nat the time of the discovery, so as to furnish a real representation of\r\nthe age of Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEKER AND SEER--A RHYME FOR THE DEDICATION OF THE WORLD'S FAIR.\r\n\r\n     EDWARD J.

A proclamation:_\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, By a joint resolution, approved June 29, 1892, it was resolved\r\nby the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of\r\nAmerica, in Congress assembled, \"That the President of the United States\r\nbe authorized and directed to issue a proclamation recommending to the\r\npeople the observance in all their localities of the 400th anniversary\r\nof the discovery of America, on the 21st day of October, 1892, by public\r\ndemonstration and by suitable exercises in their schools and other\r\nplaces of assembly.\"\r\n\r\nNow, THEREFORE, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, in pursuance of the aforesaid joint resolution, do hereby\r\nappoint Friday, October 21, 1892, the 400th anniversary of the discovery\r\nof America by Columbus, as a general holiday for the people of the\r\nUnited States. On that day let the people, so far as possible, cease\r\nfrom toil and devote themselves to such exercises as may best express\r\nhonor to the discoverer and their appreciation of the great\r\nachievements of the four completed centuries of American life.\r\n\r\nColumbus stood in his age as the pioneer of progress and enlightenment.\r\nThe system of universal education is in our age the most prominent and\r\nsalutary feature of the spirit of enlightenment, and it is peculiarly\r\nappropriate that the schools be made by the people the center of the\r\nday's demonstration. Let the national flag float over every school-house\r\nin the country, and the exercises be such as shall impress upon our\r\nyouth the patriotic duties of American citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn the churches and in the other places of assembly of the people, let\r\nthere be expressions of gratitude to Divine Providence for the devout\r\nfaith of the discoverer, and for the Divine care and guidance which has\r\ndirected our history and so abundantly blessed our people.\r\n\r\nIN TESTIMONY WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 21st day of July, in the year of\r\nour Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-two, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the one hundred and seventeenth.\r\n\r\n                                           BENJAMIN HARRISON.\r\n\r\n   ~~~~~    By the President.\r\n  {L. S.}\r\n  ~~~~~     JOHN W. FOSTER, _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADMIRATION OF A CAREFUL CRITIC.\r\n\r\n     HENRY HARRISSE, a celebrated Columbian critic, in his erudite and\r\n     valuable work, \"Columbus and the Bank of St. George.\"\r\n\r\nNor must you believe that I am inclined to lessen the merits of the\r\ngreat Genoese or fail to admire him. But my admiration is the result of\r\nreflection, and not a blind hero-worship. Columbus removed out of the\r\nrange of mere speculation the idea that beyond the Atlantic Ocean lands\r\nexisted and could be reached by sea, made of the notion a fixed fact,\r\nand linked forever the two worlds. That event, which is unquestionably\r\nthe greatest of modern times, secures to Columbus a place in the\r\npantheon dedicated to the worthies whose courageous deeds mankind will\r\nalways admire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF COLUMBUS, BY SIR ANTONIO MORO.\r\n\r\nUsed by Washington Irving to illustrate his \"Life of Columbus.\" From the\r\noriginal in the possession of Mr. C. F. Gunther of Chicago. (See pages\r\n52 and 113.)]\r\n\r\nBut our gratitude must not carry us beyond the limits of an equitable\r\nappreciation. Indiscriminate praise works mischief and injustice. When\r\ntender souls represent Columbus as being constantly the laughing-stock\r\nof all, and leading a life of misery and abandonment in Spain, they do\r\ninjustice to Deza, to Cabrera, to Quintanilla, to Mendoza, to Beatrice\r\nde Bobadilla, to Medina-Celi, to Ferdinand and Isabella, and probably a\r\nhost of others who upheld him as much as they could from the start. When\r\nblind admirers imagine that the belief in the existence of transatlantic\r\ncountries rushed out of Columbus' cogitations, complete, unaided, and\r\nalone, just as Minerva sprang in full armor from the head of Jupiter,\r\nthey disregard the efforts of numerous thinkers who, from Aristotle and\r\nRoger Bacon to Toscanelli, evolved and matured the thought, until\r\nColumbus came to realize it. When dramatists, poets, and romancers\r\nexpatiate upon the supposed spontaneous or independent character of the\r\ndiscovery of America, and ascribe the achievement exclusively to the\r\ngenius of a single man, they adopt a theory which is discouraging and\r\nuntrue.\r\n\r\nNo man is, or ever was, ahead of his times. No human efforts are, or\r\never were, disconnected from a long chain of previous exertions; and\r\nthis applies to all the walks of life. When a great event occurs, in\r\nscience as in history, the hero who seems to have caused it is only the\r\nembodiment and resulting force of the meditations, trials, and\r\nendeavors of numberless generations of fellow-workers, conscious and\r\nunconscious, known and unknown.\r\n\r\nWhen this solemn truth shall have been duly instilled into the minds of\r\nmen, we will no longer see them live in the constant expectation of\r\nMessiahs and providential beings destined to accomplish, as by a sort of\r\nmiracle, the infinite and irresistible work of civilization. They will\r\nrely exclusively upon the concentrated efforts of the whole race, and\r\ncherish the encouraging thought that, however imperceptible and\r\ninsignificant their individual contributions may seem to be, these form\r\na part of the whole, and finally redound to the happiness and progress\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF THE NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\n     DAVID HARTLEY, a celebrated English physician and philosopher. Born\r\n     at Armley, near Leeds, 1705; died, 1757.\r\n\r\nThose who have the first care of this New World will probably give it\r\nsuch directions and inherent influences as may guide and control its\r\ncourse and revolutions for ages to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUTE OF HEINRICH HEINE.\r\n\r\n     HEINRICH HEINE. Born December 12, 1799, in the Bolkerstrasse at\r\n     Dusseldorf; died in Paris, February 17, 1856.\r\n\r\n  Mancher hat schon viel gegeben,\r\n  Aber jener hat der Welt\r\n  Eine ganze Welt geschenkt\r\n  Und sie heisst America.\r\n\r\n  Nicht befreien könnt'er uns\r\n  Aus dem orden Erdenkerker\r\n  Doch er wusst ihn zu erweitern\r\n  Und die Kette zu verlängern\r\n\r\n  (_Translation._)\r\n\r\n  Some have given much already,\r\n  But this man he has presented\r\n  To the world an entire world,\r\n  With the name America.\r\n\r\n  He could not set us free, out\r\n  Of the dreary, earthly prison,\r\n  But he knew how to enlarge it\r\n  And to lengthen our chain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS' AIM NOT MERELY SECULAR.\r\n\r\n     GEORGE WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL, one of the most eminent\r\n     philosophers of the German school of metaphysics. Born at Stuttgart\r\n     in 1770; died in Berlin, 1831. From his \"Philosophy of History.\"\r\n\r\nA leading feature demanding our notice in determining the character of\r\nthis period, might be mentioned that urging of the spirit outward, that\r\ndesire on the part of man to become acquainted with his world. The\r\nchivalrous spirit of the maritime heroes of Portugal and Spain opened a\r\nnew way to the East Indies and discovered America. This progressive step\r\nalso involved no transgression of the limits of ecclesiastical\r\nprinciples or feeling. The aim of Columbus was by no means a merely\r\nsecular one; it presented also a distinctly religious aspect; the\r\ntreasures of those rich Indian lands which awaited his discovery were\r\ndestined, in his intention, to be expended in a new crusade, and the\r\nheathen inhabitants of the countries themselves were to be converted to\r\nChristianity. The recognition of the spherical figure of the earth led\r\nman to perceive that it offered him a definite and limited object, and\r\nnavigation had been benefited by the new-found instrumentality of the\r\nmagnet, enabling it to be something better than mere coasting; thus\r\ntechnical appliances make their appearance when a need for them is\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nThese events--the so-called revival of learning, the flourishing of the\r\nfine arts, and the discovery of America--may be compared with that\r\n_blush of dawn_ which after long storms first betokens the return of a\r\nbright and glorious day. This day is the day of universality, which\r\nbreaks upon the world after the long, eventful, and terrible night of\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELIEF OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     SIR ARTHUR HELPS, a popular English essayist and historian. Born,\r\n     1813; died, March 7, 1875. From his \"Life of Columbus\" (1869).\r\n\r\nColumbus believed the world to be a sphere; he underestimated its size;\r\nhe overestimated the size of the Asiatic continent. The farther that\r\ncontinent extended to the east, the nearer it came round to Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECULATION.\r\n\r\nIt has always been a favorite speculation with historians, and, indeed,\r\nwith all thinking men, to consider what would have happened from a\r\nslight change of circumstances in the course of things which led to\r\ngreat events. This may be an idle and a useless speculation, but it is\r\nan inevitable one. Never was there such a field for this kind of\r\nspeculation as in the voyages, especially the first one, of Columbus.\r\n* * * The gentlest breeze carried with it the destinies of future empires.\r\n* * * Had some breeze big with the fate of nations carried Columbus\r\nnorthward, it would hardly have been left for the English, more than a\r\ncentury afterward, to found those colonies which have proved to be the\r\nseeds of the greatest nation that the world is likely to\r\nbehold.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION TURNS TO FREEDOM'S LAND.\r\n\r\n     GEORGE HERBERT, an English poet.

Born\r\n     at Cuellar in 1549; died, 1625.\r\n\r\nColumbus was tall of stature, with a long and imposing visage. His nose\r\nwas aquiline; his eyes blue; his complexion clear, and having a tendency\r\nto a glowing red; the beard and hair red in his youth, but his fatigues\r\nearly turned them white.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INCIDENT OF THE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n     FERNANDO HERRERA, Spanish poet, 1534-1597.\r\n\r\n     Many sighed and wept, and every hour seemed a year.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF THE DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n     C. W. HODGIN, professor of history in Earlham College, Indiana.\r\n     From \"Preparation for the Discovery of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America by Columbus stands out in history as an event\r\nof supreme importance, both because of its value in itself and because\r\nof its reflex action upon Europe. It swept away the hideous monsters and\r\nfrightful apparitions with which a superstitious imagination had peopled\r\nthe unknown Atlantic, and removed at once and forever the fancied\r\ndangers in the way of its navigation. It destroyed the old patristic\r\ngeography and practically demonstrated the rotundity of the earth. It\r\noverthrew the old ideas of science and gave a new meaning to the\r\nBaconian method of investigation. It revolutionized the commerce of the\r\nworld, and greatly stimulated the intellect of Europe, already awakening\r\nfrom the long torpor of the Dark Ages. It opened the doors of a new\r\nworld, through which the oppressed and overcrowded population of the Old\r\nWorld might enter and make homes, build states, and develop a higher\r\nideal of freedom than the world had before conceived.\r\n\r\nBut this event did not come to pass by accident, neither was it the\r\nresult of a single cause. It was the culmination of a series of events,\r\neach of which had a tendency, more or less marked, to concentrate into\r\nthe close of the fifteenth century the results of an _instinct_ to\r\nsearch over unexplored seas for unknown lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS THE FIRST DISCOVERER.\r\n\r\n     FRIEDRICH HEINRICH ALEXANDER, Baron VON HUMBOLDT, the illustrious\r\n     traveler, naturalist, and cosmographer. Born in Berlin, September\r\n     14, 1769; died there May 6, 1859. He has been well termed \"The\r\n     Modern Aristotle.\"\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, Vespucci shone only by reflection from an age of\r\nglory. When compared with Columbus, Sebastian Cabot, Bartolomé Dias, and\r\nDa Gama, his place is an inferior one.\r\n\r\nThe majesty of great memories seems concentrated in the name of\r\nChristopher Columbus. It is the originality of his vast idea, the\r\nlargeness and fertility of his genius, and the courage which bore up\r\nagainst a long series of misfortunes, which have exalted the Admiral\r\nhigh above all his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PENETRATION AND EXTREME ACCURACY OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nColumbus preserved, amid so many material and minute cares, which freeze\r\nthe soul and contract the character, a profound and poetic sentiment of\r\nthe grandeur of nature. What characterizes Columbus is the penetration\r\nand extreme accuracy with which he seizes the phenomena of the external\r\nworld. He is quite as remarkable as an observer of nature as he is an\r\nintrepid navigator.\r\n\r\nArrived under new heavens, and in a new world, the configuration of\r\nlands, the aspect of vegetation, the habits of animals, the distribution\r\nof heat according to longitude, the pelagic currents, the variations of\r\nterrestrial magnetism--nothing escaped his sagacity. Columbus does not\r\nlimit himself to collecting isolated facts, he combines them, he seeks\r\ntheir mutual relations to each other. He sometimes rises with boldness\r\nto the discovery of the general laws that govern the physical\r\nworld.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nA FLIGHT OF PARROTS WAS HIS GUIDING STAR.\r\n\r\nColumbus was guided in his opinion by a flight of parrots toward the\r\nsouthwest. Never had the flight of birds more important consequences. It\r\nmay be said to have determined the first settlements on the new\r\ncontinent, and its distribution between the Latin and Germanic\r\nraces.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS A GIANT.\r\n\r\nColumbus is a giant standing on the confines between mediæval and modern\r\ntimes, and his existence marks one of the great epochs in the history of\r\nthe world.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAJESTY OF GRAND RECOLLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe majesty of grand recollections seems concentered on the illustrious\r\nname of Columbus.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION.\r\n\r\n     JOHN FLETCHER HURST, D.

By\r\n     permission of Messrs. Harper & Brothers, Publishers.\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus discovered the little West India Island of San Salvador,\r\nand raised upon the shore the cross, he dedicated it and the lands\r\nbeyond to the sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella. The \"_Gloria in\r\nExcelsis_\" was sung by the discoverer and his weary crew with as much\r\nfervor as it had ever been chanted in the cathedrals of Spain. The faith\r\nwas Roman Catholic. On his second voyage, in 1494, Columbus took with\r\nhim a vicar apostolic and twelve priests, and on the island of Haiti\r\nerected the first chapel in the western world.[40] The success of\r\nColumbus in discovering a new world in the West awakened a wild\r\nenthusiasm throughout Europe. Visions of gold inflamed the minds alike\r\nof rulers, knights, and adventurers. To discover and gather treasures,\r\nand organize vast missionary undertakings, became the mania of the\r\ntimes. No European country which possessed a strip of seaboard escaped\r\nthe delirium.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMA VIRUMQUE CANO.\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON IRVING, one of the most distinguished American authors\r\n     and humorists. Born in New York City, April 3, 1783. Died at\r\n     Sunnyside on the Hudson, N. Y., November 28, 1859. From his\r\n     \"History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus\" (4 vols.,\r\n     1828). \"This is one of those works,\" says Alexander H. Everett,\r\n     \"which are at the same time the delight of readers and the despair\r\n     of critics. It is as nearly perfect as any work well can be.\"\r\n\r\nIt is my object to relate the deeds and fortunes of the mariner who\r\nfirst had the judgment to divine, and the intrepidity to brave, the\r\nmysteries of the perilous deep; and who, by his hardy genius, his\r\ninflexible constancy, and his heroic courage, brought the ends of the\r\nearth into communication with each other. The narrative of his troubled\r\nlife is the link which connects the history of the Old World with that\r\nof the New.\r\n\r\nTo his intellectual vision it was given to read the signs of the times\r\nin the conjectures and reveries of the past ages, the indications of an\r\nunknown world, as soothsayers were said to read predictions in the\r\nstars, and to foretell events from the visions of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL AND POETICAL.\r\n\r\nHe who paints a great man merely in great and heroic traits, though he\r\nmay produce a fine picture, will never present a faithful portrait.\r\nGreat men are compounds of great and little qualities. Indeed, much of\r\ntheir greatness arises from their mastery over the imperfections of\r\ntheir nature, and their noblest actions are sometimes struck forth by\r\nthe collision of their merits and their defects.\r\n\r\nIn Columbus were singularly combined the practical and the poetical. His\r\nmind had grasped all kinds of knowledge, whether procured by study or\r\nobservation, which bore upon his theories; impatient of the scanty\r\naliment of the day, \"his impetuous ardor threw him into the study of the\r\nfathers of the Church, the Arabian Jews, and the ancient geographers\";\r\nwhile his daring but irregular genius, bursting from the limits of\r\nimperfect science, bore him to conclusions far beyond the intellectual\r\nvision of his contemporaries. If some of his conclusions were erroneous,\r\nthey were at least ingenious and splendid; and their error resulted from\r\nthe clouds which still hung over his peculiar path of enterprise. His\r\nown discoveries enlightened the ignorance of the age, guided conjecture\r\nto certainty, and dispelled that very darkness with which he had been\r\nobliged to struggle.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of his discoveries, he has been remarked for the extreme\r\nsagacity and the admirable justness with which he seized upon the\r\nphenomena of the exterior world. As they broke upon him, these phenomena\r\nwere discerned with wonderful quickness of perception, and made to\r\ncontribute important principles to the stock of general knowledge. This\r\nlucidity of spirit, this quick convertibility of facts to principles,\r\ndistinguish him from the dawn to the close of his sublime enterprise,\r\ninsomuch that, with all the sallying ardor of his imagination, his\r\nultimate success has been admirably characterized as a \"conquest of\r\nreflection.\"--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO PALOS.\r\n\r\nI can not express to you what were my feelings on treading the shore\r\nwhich had once been animated by the bustle of departure, and whose sands\r\nhad been printed by the last footstep of Columbus. The solemn and\r\nsublime nature of the event that had followed, together with the fate\r\nand fortunes of those concerned in it, filled the mind with vague yet\r\nmelancholy ideas. It was like viewing the silent and empty stage of some\r\ngreat drama when all the actors had departed. The very aspect of the\r\nlandscape, so tranquilly beautiful, had an effect upon me, and as I\r\npaced the deserted shore by the side of a descendant of one of the\r\ndiscoverers I felt my heart swelling with emotion and my eyes filling\r\nwith tears.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS AT SALAMANCA.\r\n\r\nColumbus appeared in a most unfavorable light before a select\r\nassembly--an obscure navigator, a member of no learned institution,\r\ndestitute of all the trappings and circumstances which sometimes give\r\noracular authority to dullness, and depending on the mere force of\r\nnatural genius.\r\n\r\nSome of the junta entertained the popular notion that he was an\r\nadventurer, or at best a visionary; and others had that morbid\r\nimpatience which any innovation upon established doctrine is apt to\r\nproduce in systematic minds. What a striking spectacle must the hall of\r\nthe old convent have presented at this memorable conference! A simple\r\nmariner standing forth in the midst of an imposing array of professors,\r\nfriars, and dignitaries of the Church, maintaining his theory with\r\nnatural eloquence, and, as it were, pleading the cause of the New\r\nWorld.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nA MEMORIAL TO COLUMBUS AT OLD ISABELLA.\r\n\r\n     From the _Sacred Heart Review_ of Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\nEarly in September, 1891, the proposition of erecting a monument to\r\nColumbus on the site of his first settlement in the New World, at Old\r\nIsabella, in Santo Domingo, was first broached to the _Sacred Heart\r\nReview_ of Boston by Mr. Thomas H. Cummings of that city. As the first\r\nhouse built by Columbus in the settlement was a church, it was suggested\r\nthat such a monument would indeed fitly commemorate the starting-point\r\nand rise of Christian civilization in America. The _Review_ entered\r\nheartily into the project, and steps were at once taken to secure a\r\nsuitable plot of ground for the site of the monument. Plans were also\r\ndrawn of a monument whose estimated cost would be from $3,000 to $5,000.\r\nA design which included a granite plinth and ball three feet in\r\ndiameter, surmounting a pyramid of coral and limestone twenty feet\r\nhigh,[41] was transmitted, through the Dominican consul-general at New\r\nYork to the Dominican government in Santo Domingo. Accompanying this\r\nplan was a petition, of which the following is a copy, setting forth the\r\npurpose of the _Review_, and asking certain concessions in return:\r\n\r\n     \"BOSTON, MASS., October 7, 1891.\r\n\r\n     \"HON.

The following extract is taken from a local paper,\r\n_El Porvenir_, announcing the organization of this committee:\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday last, a meeting was held in this city (Puerto Plata) for\r\nthe purpose of choosing a committee which should take part in the\r\ncelebration.

The statue and pedestal were made from designs drawn at\r\nthe Massachusetts State Normal Art School by Mr. R. Andrew, under the\r\ndirection of Prof. George Jepson, and the statue was modeled by Alois\r\nBuyens of Ghent.\r\n\r\nThe plaster cast of the monument, which has now been on exhibition at\r\nthe Museum of Fine Arts at Boston for some time, has been removed to the\r\nfoundry at Chicopee for casting. In a few months it will be transformed\r\ninto enduring bronze, and the Columbus monument will no longer be a\r\ngrowing thought but a living reality. To say it has stood the critical\r\ntest of art connoisseurs in the Boston public is to say but little; for,\r\nfrom every quarter, comments on the work of the sculptor have been\r\nhighly commendatory--the bold and vigorous treatment of the Flemish\r\nschool, of which Mr. Buyens is a disciple, being something of a novelty\r\nin these parts, and well calculated to strike the popular fancy, which\r\nalways admires strength, especially when combined with gracefulness and\r\nhigh art. Not a few of the best critics have pronounced it superior to\r\nthe average of similar statues to be found in and around Boston, and all\r\nunite in declaring it to be unquestionably a work of art, and one\r\nmeriting great praise.\r\n\r\nA recent communication from United States Consul Simpson, at Puerto\r\nPlata, announces that he has lately visited Isabella, in the interest of\r\nthe monument. He made a careful survey of the site of the ancient town,\r\nand cleared the grounds of the trees and masses of trailing vines that\r\nencumbered the ruins, and after a thorough examination, assisted by the\r\npeople of the neighborhood, he found the remains of the first church.\r\n\r\nOther communications have been received from the Dominican government\r\napproving of the change of plan, substituting the statue for the simple\r\nstone monument, and offering the memorial committee the hospitalities of\r\nthe island. And so the work goes on.\r\n\r\nThe monument, when erected, will commemorate two things--the\r\nestablishment of Christianity and the rise of civilization in the New\r\nWorld. On the spot where it will stand Columbus built the first church\r\n400 years ago.\r\n\r\nOne bronze relief shows the great discoverer in the fore-ground on\r\nbended knees with a trowel in his hand, laying the corner-stone. On the\r\nright, sits an ideal female figure, representing Mother Church,\r\nfostering a little Indian child, and pointing with uplifted hand to the\r\ncross, the emblem of man's salvation. Crouching Indians are at her feet,\r\nlistening with astonishment to the strange story, while on the left of\r\nthe cross are monks with bowed heads and lighted tapers, and in the\r\ndistance are Spanish cavaliers and hidalgos.\r\n\r\nThe conception is thoroughly Catholic, Christian, simple, and artistic;\r\nit tells its own story with a pathos and directness not often found in\r\nworks of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe second tablet is more ideal and more severely classical than the\r\nfirst. The genius of civilization, bearing gifts, is carried in a\r\nchariot drawn by prancing horses. The Admiral, at the horses' heads,\r\nwith one hand points the way for her to follow, while with the other he\r\nhands the reins to Columbia, the impersonation of the New World. An\r\nIndian at the chariot wheels stoops to gather the gifts of civilization\r\nas they fall from the cornucopia borne by the goddess. And thus is told\r\nin enduring bronze, by the genius of the artist, the symbolic story of\r\nthe introduction of civilization to the New World.\r\n\r\nUpon the face of the pedestal, a third tablet bears the inscription\r\nwhich was written at the instance of Very Rev. Dr. Charles B. Rex,\r\npresident of the Brighton Theological Seminary. Mgr. Schroeder, the\r\nauthor, interprets the meaning of the whole, in terse rhythmical Latin\r\nsentences, after the Roman lapidary style:\r\n\r\n  _Anno. claudente. sæculum XV._\r\n  _Ex. quo. coloni.

MDCCCLXXXXII._\r\n\r\n  (_Translation of the Inscription._)\r\n\r\n  Toward the close of the fifteenth century,\r\n  Christian colonists, under the leadership of Columbus,\r\n  Here on this spot built the first settlement,\r\n  And the first church dedicated\r\n  To Christ our Lord\r\n  In the new world.\r\n  A Boston paper, called the _Sacred Heart Review_,\r\n  Under the auspices of the citizens of Boston,\r\n  That the memory of so great an event might not be forgotten,\r\n  Hath erected this monument,\r\n  A. D. 1892.\r\n\r\nThe question is sometimes asked why are Catholics specially interested,\r\nand why should the _Review_ trouble itself to erect this monument. The\r\nanswer is this: We wish to locate the spot with some distinctive mark\r\nwhere civilization was first planted and where Christianity reared its\r\nfirst altar on this soil, 400 years ago. By this public act of\r\ncommemoration we hope to direct public attention to this modest\r\nbirthplace of our Mother Church, which stands to-day deserted and\r\nunhonored like a pauper's grave, a monument of shame to the carelessness\r\nand indifference of millions of American Catholics.\r\n\r\nWhy should we be specially interested? Because here on this spot the\r\nCatholic church first saw the light of day in America; here the first\r\nimportant act of the white man was the celebration of the holy mass, the\r\nsupreme act of Catholic worship; here the first instrument of\r\ncivilization that pierced the virgin soil was a cross, and here the\r\nfirst Catholic anthems resounding through the forest primeval, and vying\r\nin sweetness and melody with the song of birds, were the _Te Deum\r\nLaudamus_ and the _Gloria in Excelsis_. Sculptured marble and engraved\r\nstone we have in abundance, and tablets without number bear record to\r\ndeeds and historical events of far less importance than this. For, mark\r\nwell what these ruins and this monument stand for.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and twenty-six years before the Congregationalist church\r\nlanded on Plymouth Rock, 110 years before the Anglican church came to\r\nJamestown, and thirty-five years before the word Protestant was\r\ninvented, this church was erected, and the gospel announced to the New\r\nWorld by zealous missionaries of the Catholic faith. No other\r\ndenomination of Christians in America can claim priority or even equal\r\nduration with us in point of time. No other can show through all the\r\ncenturies of history such generous self-sacrifice and heroic missionary\r\nefforts. No other has endured such misrepresentation and bitter\r\npersecution for justice's sake. If her history here is a valuable\r\nheritage, we to whom it has descended are in duty bound to keep it alive\r\nin the memory and hearts of her children. We have recently celebrated\r\nthe centennial of the Church in the United States; but, for a still\r\ngreater reason, we should now prepare to celebrate the quadro-centennial\r\nof the Church in America. And this is why Catholics should be specially\r\ninterested in this monument. Columbus himself was a deeply religious\r\nman. He observed rigorously the fasts and ceremonies of the Church,\r\nreciting daily the entire canonical office. He began everything he wrote\r\nwith the _Jesu cum Maria sit nobis in via_ (May Jesus and Mary be always\r\nwith us). And as Irving, his biographer, says, his piety did not consist\r\nin mere forms, but partook of that lofty and solemn enthusiasm which\r\ncharacterized his whole life. In his letter to his sovereigns announcing\r\nhis discovery he indulges in no egotism, but simply asks \"Spain to\r\nexhibit a holy joy, for Christ rejoices on earth as in heaven seeing the\r\nfuture redemption of souls.\" And so his religion bursts out and seems to\r\npervade everything he touches. With such a man to commemorate and honor,\r\nthere is special reason why Catholics, and the _Review_, which\r\nrepresents them, should busy themselves with erecting a Columbus\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nBut the name and fame and beneficent work of Columbus belong to the\r\nwhole Christian world. While Catholics with gratitude recall his\r\nfortitude and heroism, and thank God, who inspired him with a firm faith\r\nand a burning charity for God and man, yet Protestants no less than\r\nCatholics share in the fruit of his work, and, we are glad to say, vie\r\nwith Catholics in proclaiming and honoring his exalted character, his\r\ncourage, fortitude, and the beneficent work he accomplished for mankind.\r\nHence Dr. Edward Everett Hale, in his recent article on Columbus in the\r\n_Independent_, voices the sentiment of every thoughtful, intelligent\r\nProtestant when he says, \"No wonder that the world of America loves and\r\nhonors the hero whose faith and courage called America into being. No\r\nwonder that she celebrates the beginning of a new century with such\r\ntributes of pride and hope as the world has never seen before.\" It is\r\nthis same becoming sentiment of gratitude which has prompted so many\r\nworthy Protestants to enroll their names on the list of gentlemen who\r\nare helping the _Review_ to mark and honor the spot Columbus chose for\r\nthe first Christian settlement on this continent.\r\n\r\nThus, so long as the bronze endures, the world will know that we\r\nvenerate the character and achievements of Columbus, and the spot where\r\nChristian civilization took its rise in the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE ITALIAN.\r\n\r\n  The daring mariner shall urge far o'er\r\n  The western wave, a smooth and level plain,\r\n  Albeit the earth is fashioned like a wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCHER OF THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\n     SAMUEL JEFFERSON, a British author. From his epic poem, \"Columbus,\"\r\n     published by S. C. Griggs & Co., Chicago.[43]\r\n\r\n  Thou searcher of the ocean, thee to sing\r\n  Shall my devoted lyre awake each string!\r\n  Columbus! Hero! Would my song could tell\r\n  How great thy worth! No praise can overswell\r\n  The grandeur of thy deeds! Thine eagle eye\r\n  Pierced through the clouds of ages to descry\r\n  From empyrean heights where thou didst soar\r\n  With bright imagination winged by lore--\r\n  The signs of continents as yet unknown;\r\n  Across the deep thy keen-eyed glance was thrown;\r\n  Thou, with prevailing longing, still aspired\r\n  To reach the goal thy ardent soul desired;\r\n  Thy heavenward soaring spirit, bold, elate,\r\n  Scorned long delay and conquered chance and fate;\r\n  Thy valor followed thy far-searching eyes,\r\n  Until success crowned thy bold emprize.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELIPA, WIFE OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     ANNIE FELLOWS JOHNSTON. From a poem published in _Harper's Weekly_,\r\n     June 25, 1892.[44]\r\n\r\n  More than the compass to the mariner\r\n  Wast thou, Felipa, to his dauntless soul.\r\n  Through adverse winds that threatened wreck, and nights\r\n  Of rayless gloom, thou pointed ever to\r\n  The north star of his great ambition. He\r\n  Who once has lost an Eden, or has gained\r\n  A paradise by Eve's sweet influence,\r\n  Alone can know how strong a spell lies in\r\n  The witchery of a woman's beckoning hand.\r\n  And thou didst draw him, tidelike, higher still,\r\n  Felipa, whispering the lessons learned\r\n  From thy courageous father, till the flood\r\n  Of his ambition burst all barriers,\r\n  And swept him onward to his longed-for goal.\r\n\r\n  Before the jewels of a Spanish queen\r\n  Built fleets to waft him on his untried way,\r\n  Thou gavest thy wealth of wifely sympathy\r\n  To build the lofty purpose of his soul.\r\n  And now the centuries have cycled by,\r\n  Till thou art all forgotten by the throng\r\n  That lauds the great Pathfinder of the deep.\r\n  It matters not, in that infinitude\r\n  Of space where thou dost guide thy spirit bark\r\n  To undiscovered lands, supremely fair.\r\n  If to this little planet thou couldst turn\r\n  And voyage, wraithlike, to its cloud-hung rim,\r\n  Thou wouldst not care for praise. And if, perchance,\r\n  Some hand held out to thee a laurel bough,\r\n  Thou wouldst not claim one leaf, but fondly turn\r\n  To lay thy tribute also at his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCREASING INTEREST IN COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     JOHN S. KENNEDY, an American author.\r\n\r\nThe near approach of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America\r\nhas revived in all parts of the civilized world great interest in\r\neverything concerning that memorable event and the perilous voyage of\r\nthe great navigator whom it has immortalized.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MECCA OF THE NATION.\r\n\r\n     MOSES KING, an American geographer of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nI have read somewhere that in the northeastern part of Havana stands,\r\nfacing an open square, a brown stone church, blackened by age, and\r\ndignified by the name of \"cathedral.\" It is visited by every American,\r\nbecause within its walls lies buried all that remains of the great\r\ndiscoverer, Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE OF THE DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\nWas it by the coarse law of demand and supply that a Columbus was\r\nhaunted by the ghost of a round planet at the time when the New World\r\nwas needed for the interests of civilization?--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNANIMITY.\r\n\r\n     ARTHUR G. KNIGHT, in his \"Life of Columbus.\"\r\n\r\nThrough all the slow martyrdom of long delays and bitter\r\ndisappointments, he never faltered in his lofty purpose; in the hour of\r\ntriumph he was self-possessed and unassuming; under cruel persecution he\r\nwas patient and forgiving. For almost unexampled services he certainly\r\nreceived a poor reward on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDEAS OF THE ANCIENTS.\r\n\r\n     LUCIUS LACTANTIUS, an eminent Christian author, 260-325 A. D.\r\n\r\nIs there any one so foolish as to believe that there are antipodes with\r\ntheir feet opposite to ours; that there is a part of the world in which\r\nall things are topsy-turvy, where the trees grow with their branches\r\ndownward, and where it rains, hails, and snows upward?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE FRONT PARK STATUE OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nThe World's Fair city is a close competitor with the historic cities of\r\nthe Old World for the grandest monument to Columbus and the fittest\r\nlocation for it. At Barcelona, on the Paseo Colon, seaward, a snowy\r\nmarble Admiral looks toward the Shadowy Sea. At Genoa, 'mid the palms of\r\nthe Piazza Acquaverde, a noble representation of the noblest Genoese\r\nfaces the fitful gusts of the Mediterranean and fondly guards an Indian\r\nmaid. A lofty but rude cairn marks the Admiral's first footprints on the\r\nshores of the wreck-strewn Bahamas, and many a monument or encomiastic\r\ninscription denotes spots sacred to the history of his indomitable\r\nresolve. These all commemorate, as it were, but the inception of the\r\ngreat discovery. It remains for Chicago to perpetuate the results, and\r\nmost fitly to place an heroic figure of the first Admiral viewing, and\r\nin full view of all.\r\n\r\nOn the Lake Front Park, in full view of the ceaseless commercial\r\nactivity of the Great Lakes, and close by the hum of the hive of human\r\nindustry, grandly will a bronze Columbus face the blasts from Michigan's\r\nbosom. There the greatest navigator stands,\r\n\r\n  Calm, his prescience verified,\r\n\r\nproudly through the ages watching the full fruits of that first and\r\nfateful voyage over the waves of the seas of mystery, to found a nation\r\nwhere Freedom alone should be supreme. Just where the big monument will\r\nbe located on Lake Front Park has not been decided, but a site south of\r\nthe Auditorium, midway between the Illinois Central tracks and Michigan\r\nBoulevard, will perhaps be chosen. The statue proper will be twenty feet\r\nhigh. It will be of bronze, mounted on a massive granite pedestal, of\r\nthirty feet in height, and will serve for all time as a memorial of the\r\nExposition.\r\n\r\nThe chosen artist, out of the many who submitted designs, was Mr. Howard\r\nKretschmar, a Chicago sculptor of rare power and artistic talent.\r\n\r\nThe massive figure of Columbus is represented at the moment the land,\r\nand the glorious future of his great discovery, burst upon his delighted\r\ngaze. No ascetic monk, no curled cavalier, looks down from the pedestal.\r\nThe apocryphal portraits of Europe may peer out of their frames in this\r\nguise, but it has been the artist's aim here to chisel _a man, not a\r\nmonk; and a noble man_, rather than a cringing courtier. Above the\r\nmassive pedestal of simple design, which bears the terse legend,\r\n\"Erected by the World's Columbian Exposition, A. D. 1893,\" stands the\r\nnoble figure of the Noah of our nation. The open doublet discloses the\r\nmassive proportions of a more than well-knit man. The left hand, pressed\r\nto the bosom, indicates the tension of his feelings, and the\r\noutstretched hand but further intensifies the dawning and gradually\r\no'erwhelming sense of the future, the possibilities of his grand\r\ndiscovery. One of the noblest conceptions in bronze upon this continent\r\nis Mr. Howard Kretschmar's \"Columbus,\" and of it may Chicago well be\r\nproud.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS THE CIVILIZER.\r\n\r\n     ALPHONSE LAMARTINE, the learned French writer and politician. Born\r\n     at Macon, 1792; died, 1869. From \"Life of Columbus.\"\r\n\r\nAll the characteristics of a truly great man are united in Columbus.\r\nGenius, labor, patience, obscurity of origin, overcome by energy of\r\nwill; mild but persisting firmness, resignation toward heaven, struggle\r\nagainst the world; long conception of the idea in solitude, heroic\r\nexecution of it in action; intrepidity and coolness in storms,\r\nfearlessness of death in civil strife; confidence in the destiny--not of\r\nan individual, but of the human race; a life risked without hesitation\r\nor retrospect in venturing into the unknown and phantom-peopled ocean,\r\n1,500 leagues across, and on which the first step no more allowed of\r\nsecond thoughts than Cæsar's passage of the Rubicon; untiring study,\r\nknowledge as extensive as the science of his day, skillful but honorable\r\nmanagement of courts to persuade them to truth; propriety of demeanor,\r\nnobleness, and dignity in outward bearing, which afford proof of\r\ngreatness of mind and attracts eyes and hearts; language adapted to the\r\ngrandeur of his thoughts; eloquence which could convince kings and quell\r\nthe mutiny of crews; a natural poetry of style, which placed his\r\nnarrative on a par with the wonders of his discoveries and the marvels\r\nof nature; an immense, ardent, and enduring love for the human race,\r\npiercing even into that distant future in which humanity forgets those\r\nthat do it service; legislative wisdom and philosophic mildness in the\r\ngovernment of his colonies; paternal compassion for those Indians,\r\ninfants of humanity, whom he wished to give over to the\r\nguardianship--not to the tyranny and oppression--of the Old World;\r\nforgetfulness of injury and magnanimous forgiveness of his enemies; and\r\nlastly, piety, that virtue which includes and exalts all other virtues,\r\nwhen it exists as it did in the mind of Columbus--the constant presence\r\nof God in the soul, of justice in the conscience, of mercy in the heart,\r\nof gratitude in success, of resignation in reverses, of worship always\r\nand everywhere.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man. We know of none more perfect. He contains several\r\nimpersonations within himself. He was worthy to represent the ancient\r\nworld before that unknown continent on which he was the first to set\r\nfoot, and carry to these men of a new race all the virtues, without any\r\nof the vices, of the elder hemisphere. So great was his influence on the\r\ndestiny of the earth, that none more than he ever deserved the name of a\r\n_Civilizer_.\r\n\r\nHis influence in civilization was immeasurable. He completed the world.\r\nHe realized the physical unity of the globe. He advanced, far beyond all\r\nthat had been done before his time, the work of God--the SPIRITUAL UNITY\r\nOF THE HUMAN RACE. This work, in which Columbus had so largely assisted,\r\nwas indeed too great to be worthily rewarded even by affixing his name\r\nto the fourth continent. America bears not that name, but the human\r\nrace, drawn together and cemented by him, will spread his renown over\r\nthe whole earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PSALM OF THE WEST.\r\n\r\n     SIDNEY LANIER, an American poet of considerable talent. Born at\r\n     Macon, Ga., February 3, 1842; died at Lynn, N. C., September 8,\r\n     1881. From his \"Psalm of the West.\"[45] Lanier was the author of\r\n     the \"Centennial Ode.\"\r\n\r\n  Santa Maria, well thou tremblest down the wave,\r\n    Thy Pinta far abow, thy Niña nigh astern;\r\n  Columbus stands in the night alone, and, passing grave,\r\n    Yearns o'er the sea as tones o'er under-silence yearn.\r\n  Heartens his heart as friend befriends his friend less brave,\r\n    Makes burn the faiths that cool, and cools the doubts that burn.\r\n\r\n  \"'Twixt this and dawn, three hours my soul will smite\r\n    With prickly seconds, or less tolerably\r\n    With dull-blade minutes flatwise slapping me.\r\n  Wait, heart!

He\r\ndreamed of golden palaces, heaps of treasure, and mines teeming with\r\nendless wealth. His cry was everywhere for gold. Every moment, in his\r\nfierce avarice, he would fancy himself on the brink of boundless\r\nopulence; he was always about to seize the treasures of the East,\r\npainted by Marco Polo and Mandeville. \"Gold,\" he wrote to the King and\r\nQueen, \"is the most valuable thing in the world; it rescues souls from\r\npurgatory and restores them to the joys of paradise.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IN THE MARIÑOL (MINISTRY\r\nOF THE COLONIES), MADRID, SPAIN.

It is a testimony of\r\nhonor and gratitude to that immortal man of whom we have spoken, who,\r\ndesirous of finding a road by which the light and truth and all the\r\nadornments of civil culture might be carried to the most distant parts\r\nof the world, could neither be deterred by dangers nor wearied by\r\nlabors, until, having in a certain manner renewed the bonds between two\r\nparts of the human race so long separated, he bestowed upon both such\r\ngreat benefits that he in justice must be said to have few equals or a\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS THE GLORY OF CATHOLICISM.\r\n\r\nThe Pope held a reception at the Vatican on the occasion of the festival\r\nof his patron saint, St. Joachim. In an address he referred to Columbus\r\nas the glory of Catholicism, and thanked the donors of the new Church of\r\nSt. Joachim for commemorating his jubilee.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POPE REVIEWS THE LIFE OF THE DISCOVERER.\r\n\r\n     The following is the text of the letter addressed by Leo XIII. to\r\n     the archbishops and bishops of Spain, Italy, and the two Americas\r\n     on the subject of Christopher Columbus.\r\n\r\n     LETTER OF OUR VERY HOLY FATHER, LEO XIII., POPE BY DIVINE\r\n     PROVIDENCE, TO THE ARCHBISHOPS AND BISHOPS OF SPAIN, ITALY, AND OF\r\n     THE TWO AMERICAS, UPON CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     _To the Archbishops and Bishops of Spain and Italy, and of the two\r\n     Americas. Leo XIII., Pope._\r\n\r\n     VENERABLE BROTHERS, GREETING AND APOSTOLIC BENEDICTION: From the\r\n     end of the fifteenth century, since a man from Liguria first\r\n     landed, under the auspices of God, on the transatlantic shores,\r\n     humanity has been strongly inclined to celebrate with gratitude the\r\n     recollection of this event. It would certainly not be an easy\r\n     matter to find a more worthy cause to touch their hearts and to\r\n     inflame their zeal. The event, in effect, is such in itself that no\r\n     other epoch has seen a grander and more beautiful one accomplished\r\n     by man.\r\n\r\n     As to who accomplished it, there are few who can be compared to him\r\n     in greatness of soul and genius. By his work a new world flashed\r\n     forth from the unexplored ocean, thousands upon thousands of\r\n     mortals were returned to the common society of the human race, led\r\n     from their barbarous life to peacefulness and civilization, and,\r\n     which is of much more importance, recalled from perdition to\r\n     eternal life by the bestowal of the gifts which Jesus Christ\r\n     brought to the world.\r\n\r\n     Europe, astonished alike by the novelty and the prodigiousness of\r\n     this unexpected event, understood little by little, in due course\r\n     of time, what she owed to Columbus, when, by sending colonies to\r\n     America, by frequent communications, by exchange of services, by\r\n     the resources confided to the sea and received in return, there was\r\n     discovered an accession of the most favorable nature possible to\r\n     the knowledge of nature, to the reciprocal abundance of riches,\r\n     with the result that the prestige of Europe increased enormously.\r\n\r\n     Therefore, it would not be fitting, amid these numerous\r\n     testimonials on honor, and in these concerts of felicitations, that\r\n     the Church should maintain complete silence, since, in accordance\r\n     with her character and her institution, she willingly approves and\r\n     endeavors to favor all that appears, wherever it is, to be worthy\r\n     of honor and praise. Undoubtedly she receives particular and\r\n     supreme honors to the virtues pre-eminent in regard to morality,\r\n     inasmuch as they are united to the eternal salvation of souls;\r\n     nevertheless, she does not despise the rest, neither does she\r\n     abstain from esteeming them as they deserve; it is even her habit\r\n     to favor with all her power and to always have in honor those who\r\n     have well merited of human society and who have passed to\r\n     posterity.\r\n\r\n     Certainly, God is admirable in His saints, but the vestiges of His\r\n     divine virtues appear as imprinted in those in whom shines a\r\n     superior force of soul and mind, for this elevation of heart and\r\n     this spark of genius could only come from God, their author and\r\n     protector.\r\n\r\n     It is in addition an entirely special reason for which we believe\r\n     we should commemorate in a grateful spirit this immortal event. It\r\n     is that Columbus is one of us. When one considers with what motive\r\n     above all he undertook the plan of exploring the dark sea, and with\r\n     what object he endeavored to realize this plan, one can not doubt\r\n     that the Catholic faith superlatively inspired the enterprise and\r\n     its execution, so that by this title, also, humanity is not a\r\n     little indebted to the Church.\r\n\r\n     There are without doubt many men of hardihood and full of\r\n     experience who, before Christopher Columbus and after him, explored\r\n     with persevering efforts unknown lands across seas still more\r\n     unknown. Their memory is celebrated, and will be so by the renown\r\n     and the recollection of their good deeds, seeing that they have\r\n     extended the frontiers of science and of civilization, and that not\r\n     at the price of slight efforts, but with an exalted ardor of\r\n     spirit, and often through extreme perils. It is not the less true\r\n     that there is a great difference between them and him of whom we\r\n     speak.\r\n\r\n     The eminently distinctive point in Columbus is, that in crossing\r\n     the immense expanses of the ocean he followed an object more grand\r\n     and more elevated than the others. This does not say, doubtless,\r\n     that he was not in any way influenced by the very praiseworthy\r\n     desire to be master of science, to well deserve the approval of\r\n     society, or that he despised the glory whose stimulant is\r\n     ordinarily more sensitive to elevated minds, or that he was not at\r\n     all looking to his own personal interests. But above all these\r\n     human reasons, that of religion was uppermost by a great deal in\r\n     him, and it was this, without any doubt, which sustained his spirit\r\n     and his will, and which frequently, in the midst of extreme\r\n     difficulties, filled him with consolation. He learned in reality\r\n     that his plan, his resolution profoundly carved in his heart, was\r\n     to open access to the gospel in new lands and in new seas.\r\n\r\n     This may seem hardly probable to those who, concentrating all their\r\n     care, all their thoughts, in the present nature of things, as it is\r\n     perceived by the senses, refuse to look upon greater benefits. But,\r\n     on the other hand, it is the characteristic of eminent minds to\r\n     prefer to elevate themselves higher, for they are better disposed\r\n     than all others to seize the impulses and the inspirations of the\r\n     divine faith. Certainly, Columbus had united the study of nature to\r\n     the study of religion, and he had conformed his mind to the\r\n     precepts intimately drawn from the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\n     It is thus that, having learned by astronomy and ancient documents\r\n     that beyond the limits of the known world there were, in addition,\r\n     toward the west, large tracts of territory unexplored up to that\r\n     time by anybody, he considered in his mind the immense multitude of\r\n     those who were plunged in lamentable darkness, subject to insensate\r\n     rites and to the superstitions of senseless divinities. He\r\n     considered that they miserably led a savage life, with ferocious\r\n     customs; that, more miserably still, they were wanting in all\r\n     notion of the most important things, and that they were plunged in\r\n     ignorance of the only true God.\r\n\r\n     Thus, in considering this in himself, he aimed first of all to\r\n     propagate the name of Christianity and the benefits of Christian\r\n     charity in the West. As a fact, as soon as he presented himself to\r\n     the sovereigns of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, he explained the\r\n     cause for which they were not to fear taking a warm interest in the\r\n     enterprise, as their glory would increase to the point of becoming\r\n     immortal if they decided to carry the name and the doctrine of\r\n     Jesus Christ into such distant regions. And when, not long\r\n     afterward, his prayers were granted, he called to witness that he\r\n     wished to obtain from God that these sovereigns, sustained by His\r\n     help and His mercy, should persevere in causing the gospel to\r\n     penetrate upon new shores and in new lands.\r\n\r\n     He conceived in the same manner the plan of asking Alexander VI.\r\n     for apostolic men, by a letter in which these words are found: \"I\r\n     hope that it will some day be given to me with the help of God to\r\n     propagate afar the very holy name of Jesus Christ and his gospel.\"\r\n     Also can one imagine him all filled with joy when he wrote to\r\n     Raphael Sanchez, the first who from the Indies had returned to\r\n     Lisbon, that immortal actions of grace must be rendered to God in\r\n     that he had deigned to cause to prosper the enterprise so well, and\r\n     that Jesus Christ could rejoice and triumph upon earth and in\r\n     heaven for the coming salvation of innumerable people who\r\n     previously had been going to their ruin. That, if Columbus also\r\n     asks of Ferdinand and Isabella to permit only Catholic Christians\r\n     to go to the New World, there to accelerate trade with the natives,\r\n     he supports this motive by the fact that by his enterprise and\r\n     efforts he has not sought for anything else than the glory and the\r\n     development of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\n     This was what was perfectly known to Isabella, who, better than any\r\n     other person, had penetrated the mind of such a great man; much\r\n     more, it appears that this same plan was fully adopted by this very\r\n     pious woman of great heart and manly mind. She bore witness, in\r\n     effect, of Columbus, that in courageously giving himself up to the\r\n     vast ocean, he realized, for the divine glory, a most signal\r\n     enterprise; and to Columbus himself, when he had happily returned,\r\n     she wrote that she esteemed as having been highly employed the\r\n     resources which she had consecrated and which she would still\r\n     consecrate to the expeditions in the Indies, in view of the fact\r\n     that the propagation of Catholicism would result from them.\r\n\r\n     Also, if he had not inspired himself from a cause superior to human\r\n     interests, where then would he have drawn the constancy and the\r\n     strength of soul to support what he was obliged to the end to\r\n     endure and to submit to; that is to say, the unpropitious advice of\r\n     the learned people, the repulses of princes, the tempests of the\r\n     furious ocean, the continual watches, during which he more than\r\n     once risked losing his sight.\r\n\r\n     To that add the combats sustained against the barbarians; the\r\n     infidelities of his friends, of his companions; the villainous\r\n     conspiracies, the perfidiousness of the envious, the calumnies of\r\n     the traducers, the chains with which, after all, though innocent,\r\n     he was loaded. It was inevitable that a man overwhelmed with a\r\n     burden of trials so great and so intense would have succumbed had\r\n     he not sustained himself by the consciousness of fulfilling a very\r\n     noble enterprise, which he conjectured would be glorious for the\r\n     Christian name and salutary for an infinite multitude.\r\n\r\n     And the enterprise so carried out is admirably illustrated by the\r\n     events of that time. In effect, Columbus discovered America at\r\n     about the period when a great tempest was going to unchain itself\r\n     against the Church. Inasmuch as it is permitted by the course of\r\n     events to appreciate the ways of divine Providence, it really seems\r\n     that the man for whom the Liguria honors herself was destined by\r\n     special plan of God to compensate Catholicism for the injury which\r\n     it was going to suffer in Europe.\r\n\r\n     To call the Indian race to Christianity, this was, without doubt,\r\n     the mission and the work of the Church in this mission. From the\r\n     beginning, she continued to fulfill it with an uninterrupted course\r\n     of charity, and she still continues it, having advanced herself\r\n     recently so far as the extremities of Patagonia.\r\n\r\n     Thus, when compelled by the Portuguese, by the Genoese, to leave\r\n     without having obtained any result, he went to Spain. He matured\r\n     the grand plan of the projected discovery in the midst of the walls\r\n     of a convent, with the knowledge of and with the advice of a monk\r\n     of the Order of St. Francis d'Assisi, after seven years had\r\n     revolved. When at last he goes to dare the ocean, he takes care\r\n     that the expedition shall comply with the acts of spiritual\r\n     expiation; he prays to the Queen of Heaven to assist the enterprise\r\n     and to direct its course, and before giving the order to make sail\r\n     he invokes the august divine Trinity. Then, once fairly at sea,\r\n     while the waters agitate themselves, while the crew murmurs, he\r\n     maintains, under God's care, a calm constancy of mind.\r\n\r\n     His plan manifests itself in the very names which he imposes on the\r\n     new islands, and each time that he is called upon to land upon one\r\n     of them he worships the Almighty God, and only takes possession of\r\n     it in the name of Jesus Christ. At whatever coast he approaches he\r\n     has nothing more as his first idea than the planting on the shore\r\n     of the sacred sign of the cross; and the divine name of the\r\n     Redeemer, which he had sung so frequently on the open sea to the\r\n     sound of the murmuring waves--he is the first to make it\r\n     reverberate in the new islands in the same way. When he institutes\r\n     the Spanish colony he causes it to be commenced by the construction\r\n     of a temple, where he first provides that the popular fêtes shall\r\n     be celebrated by august ceremonies.\r\n\r\n     Here, then, is what Columbus aimed at and what he accomplished when\r\n     he went in search, over so great an expanse of sea and of land, of\r\n     regions up to that time unexplored and uncultivated, but whose\r\n     civilization, renown, and riches were to rapidly attain that\r\n     immense development which we see to-day.\r\n\r\n     In all this, the magnitude of the event, the efficacy and the\r\n     variety of the benefits which have resulted from it, tend assuredly\r\n     to celebrate he, who was the author of it, by a grateful\r\n     remembrance and by all sorts of testimonials of honor; but, in the\r\n     first place, we must recognize and venerate particularly the divine\r\n     project, to which the discoverer of the New World was subservient\r\n     and which he knowingly obeyed.\r\n\r\n     In order to celebrate worthily and in a manner suitable to the\r\n     truth of the facts the solemn anniversary of Columbus, the\r\n     sacredness of religion must be united to the splendor of the civil\r\n     pomp. This is why, as previously, at the first announcement of the\r\n     event, public actions of grace were rendered to the providence of\r\n     the immortal God, upon the example which the Supreme Pontiff gave;\r\n     the same also now, in celebrating the recollection of the\r\n     auspicious event, we esteem that we must do as much.\r\n\r\n     We decree to this effect, that the day of October 12th, or the\r\n     following Sunday, if the respective diocesan bishops judge it to be\r\n     opportune, that, after the office of the day, the solemn mass of\r\n     the very Holy Trinity shall be celebrated in the cathedral and\r\n     collegial churches of Spain, Italy, and the two Americas. In\r\n     addition to these countries, we hope that, upon the initiative of\r\n     the bishops, as much may be done in the others, for it is fitting\r\n     that all should concur in celebrating with piety and gratitude an\r\n     event which has been profitable to all.\r\n\r\n     In the meanwhile, as a pledge of the celestial favors and in\r\n     testimony of our fraternal good-will, we affectionately accord in\r\n     the Lord the Apostolic benediction to you, venerable brothers, to\r\n     your clergy, and to your people.\r\n\r\n     Given at Rome, near St. Peter's, July 16th of the year 1892, the\r\n     fifteenth of our Pontificate.\r\n\r\n                                                    LEO XIII., _Pope_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SPAIN.\r\n\r\n     CAPEL LOFFT.\r\n\r\n  O generous nation! to whose noble boast,\r\n    Illustrious Spain, the providence of Heaven\r\n    A radiant sky of vivid power hath given,\r\n  A land of flowers, of fruits, profuse; an host\r\n  Of ardent spirits; when deprest the most,\r\n    By great, enthusiastic impulse driven\r\n  To deeds of highest daring.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRAPPED IN A VISION GLORIOUS.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. JOHN LORD, LL. D., a popular American lecturer and\r\n     Congregational minister. Born in Portsmouth, N. H., December 27,\r\n     1810.\r\n\r\nWrapped up in those glorious visions which come only to a man of\r\nsuperlative genius, and which make him insensible to heat and cold and\r\nscanty fare, even to reproach and scorn, this intrepid soul, inspired by\r\na great and original idea, wandered from city to city, and country to\r\ncountry, and court to court, to present the certain greatness and wealth\r\nof any state that would embark in his enterprise. But all were alike\r\ncynical, cold, unbelieving, and even insulting. He opposes overwhelming\r\nuniversal and overpowering ideas. To have surmounted these amid such\r\nprotracted opposition and discouragment constitutes his greatness; and\r\nfinally to prove his position by absolute experiment and hazardous\r\nenterprise makes him one of the greatest of human benefactors, whose\r\nfame will last through all the generations of men. And as I survey that\r\nlonely, abstracted, disappointed, and derided man--poor and unimportant;\r\nso harassed by debt that his creditors seized even his maps and charts;\r\nobliged to fly from one country to another to escape imprisonment;\r\nwithout even listeners and still less friends, and yet with\r\never-increasing faith in his cause; utterly unconquerable; alone in\r\nopposition to all the world--I think I see the most persistent man of\r\nenterprise that I have read of in history. Critics ambitious to say\r\nsomething new may rake out slanders from the archives of enemies and\r\ndiscover faults which derogate from the character we have been taught to\r\nadmire and venerate; they may even point out spots, which we can not\r\ndisprove, in that sun of glorious brightness which shed its beneficent\r\nrays over a century of darkness--but this we know, that whatever may be\r\nthe force of detraction, his fame has been steadily increasing, even on\r\nthe admission of his slanderers, for three centuries, and that he now\r\nshines as a fixed star in the constellation of the great lights of\r\nmodern times, not only because he succeeded in crossing the ocean when\r\nonce embarked on it, but for surmounting the moral difficulties which\r\nlay in his way before he could embark upon it, and for being finally\r\ninstrumental in conferring the greatest boon that our world has received\r\nfrom any mortal man since Noah entered into the ark.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE GRACE OF GOD HE WAS WHAT HE WAS.\r\n\r\n     ROSSELY DE LORGUES, a Catholic biographer.\r\n\r\nColumbus did not owe his great celebrity to his genius or conscience,\r\nbut only to his vocation, to his faith, and to the Divine grace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN HONOR OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Janssens of New Orleans has issued a letter to his diocese\r\ndirecting a general observance of the 400th anniversary of the discovery\r\nof America. The opening paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n\"Christopher Columbus was a sincere and devout Catholic; his remarkable\r\nvoyage was made possible by the intercession of a holy monk and by the\r\npatronage and liberality of the pious Queen Isabella. The cross of\r\nChrist, the emblem of our holy religion, was planted on America's virgin\r\nsoil, and the _Te Deum_ and the holy mass were the first religious\r\nservices held on the same. It is, therefore, just and proper that this\r\ngreat event and festival should be celebrated in a religious as well as\r\na civil manner.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pope having set the Julian date of October 12th for the celebration,\r\nand the President October 21st, the archbishop directs that exercises be\r\nheld on both these days--the first of a religious character, the second\r\ncivic. October 12th a solemn votive mass will be sung in all the\r\nchurches of the diocese, with an exhortation, and October 21st in the\r\ncity of New Orleans the clergy will assemble at the archiepiscopal\r\nresidence early in the morning and march to the cathedral, where\r\nservices will be held at 7.30 o'clock. Sermons of ten minutes each are\r\nto be preached in English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPREGNABLE WILL OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL, an American poet.

MACKIE, an American author. From his \"With the Admiral\r\n     of the Ocean Sea.\" Published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.,\r\n     Chicago.\r\n\r\nWhatever were his mistakes and shortcomings, Colon was neither a\r\nvisionary nor an imbecile. Had he been perfect in all things and wise to\r\nthe point of infallibility, we could not have claimed him as the\r\nglorious credit he was to the common humanity to which we all belong.\r\nHis greatness was sufficient to cover with its mantle far more of the\r\nweaknesses of frail mortality than he had to draw under its protection;\r\nand it becomes us who attempt to analyze his life in these later days,\r\nto bear in mind that, had his lot befallen ourselves, the natives of the\r\nwestern world would still, beyond a peradventure, be wandering in\r\nundraped peace through their tangled woods, and remain forever ignorant\r\nof the art of eating meat. In his trials and distresses the Admiral\r\nencountered only the portion of the sons of Adam; but to him was also\r\ngiven, as to few before or since, to say with the nameless shepherd of\r\nTempe's classic vale, \"I, too, have lived in Arcady.\"\r\n\r\nColon did not merely discover the New World. He spent seven years and\r\none month among the islands and on the coasts of the hemisphere now\r\ncalled after the ship-chandler who helped to outfit his later\r\nexpeditions. For the greater part of that time he was under the constant\r\nburden of knowing that venomous intrigue and misrepresentation were\r\ndoing their deadly work at home while he did what he believed was his\r\nHeaven-imposed duty on this side the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMBUS MONUMENT IN MADRID.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the Paseo de Recoletos is a monument to Columbus in the\r\ndebased Gothic style of Ferdinand and Isabella.

If\r\nColumbus should have acquired a knowledge of the accounts transmitted to\r\nus of the discoveries of the Northmen in conversations held in Latin\r\nwith the Bishop of Skalholt and the learned men of Iceland, we may the\r\nmore readily conceive his firm belief in the possibility of\r\nrediscovering a western continent, and his unwearied zeal in putting his\r\nplans in execution. The discovery of America, so momentous in its\r\nresults, may therefore be regarded as the mediate consequence of its\r\nprevious discovery by the Scandinavians, which may be thus placed among\r\nthe most important events of former ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF COLUMBUS, BY SENOR G.

These murmurings and complaints were rung from his manly spirit\r\nby sickness and sorrow, and though reduced almost to the brink of\r\ndespair by the injustice of the King, yet do we find nothing harsh or\r\ndisrespectful in his language to the sovereign. A curious contrast is\r\npresented to us. The gift of a world could not move the monarch to\r\ngratitude; the infliction of chains, as a recompense for that gift,\r\ncould not provoke the subject to disloyalty. The same great heart which\r\nthrough more than twenty wearisome years of disappointment and chagrin\r\ngave him strength to beg and buffet his way to glory, still taught him\r\nto bear with majestic meekness the conversion of that glory into\r\nunmerited shame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe look back with astonishment and admiration at the stupendous\r\nachievement effected a whole lifetime later by the immortal Columbus--an\r\nachievement which formed the connecting link between the Old World and\r\nthe New; yet the explorations instituted by Prince Henry of Portugal\r\nwere in truth the anvil upon which that link was forged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe arrived in a vessel as shattered as his own broken and careworn\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS HEARD OF NORSE DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\n     CONRAD MALTE-BRUN, a Danish author and geographer of great merit.\r\n     Born at Thister in Jutland, 1775; died, December, 1826.\r\n\r\nColumbus, when in Italy, had heard of the Norse discoveries beyond\r\nIceland, for Rome was then the world's center, and all information of\r\nimportance was sent there.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS AND COPERNICUS.\r\n\r\n     HELEN P.

While Columbus, in his\r\nfrail craft, was making his way to \"worlds unknown, and isles beyond the\r\ndeep,\" on the shores of the Baltic a young novitiate, amid the rigors of\r\na monastic life, was tracing the course of the planets, and solving the\r\nproblem in which Virgil delighted[47]--problems which had baffled\r\nChaldean and Persian, Egyptian and Saracen. Columbus explained the\r\nearth, Copernicus explained the heavens. Neither of the great\r\ndiscoverers lived to see the result of his labors, for the Prussian\r\nastronomer died on the day that his work was published.

N., C. B., F. R. S., a noted\r\n     explorer and talented English author. Midshipman in H. M. S.\r\n     Assistance in the Franklin Search Expedition, 1850-51. Born July\r\n     20, 1830, at Stillingfleet, near York. From a paper read before the\r\n     Royal Geographical Society of England, June 20, 1892.\r\n\r\nIn the present year the fourth centenary of the discovery of America by\r\nColumbus will be celebrated with great enthusiasm in Spain, in Italy,\r\nand in America. That discovery was, without any doubt, the most\r\nmomentous event since the fall of the Roman Empire in its effect on the\r\nworld's history. In its bearings on our science, the light thrown across\r\nthe sea of darkness by the great Genoese was nothing less than the\r\ncreation of modern geography. It seems fitting, therefore, that this\r\nsociety should take some share in the commemoration, and that we should\r\ndevote one evening in this session to a consideration of some leading\r\npoints in the life of the foremost of all geographers. * * *\r\n\r\nMuch new light has been thrown upon the birth and early life of\r\nColumbus, of late years, by the careful examination of monastic and\r\nnotarial records at Genoa and Savona. At Genoa the original documents\r\nare still preserved. At Savona they no longer exist, and we are\r\ndependent on copies made two centuries ago by Salinerius. But both the\r\nGenoa and Savona records may be safely accepted, and we are thus\r\nfurnished with a new and more interesting view of the early life of\r\nColumbus. Our thanks for this new light are mainly due to the laborious\r\nand scholarly researches of the Marchese Marcello Staglieno of Genoa,\r\nand to the work of Mr. Harrisse. We may take it as fully established\r\nthat the original home of Giovanni Colombo, the grandfather of the great\r\ndiscoverer, was at Terrarossa, a small stone house, the massive walls\r\nof which are still standing on a hillside forming the northern slope of\r\nthe beautiful valley of Fontanabuona. Here, no doubt, the father of\r\nColumbus was born; but the family moved to Quinto-al-Mare, then a\r\nfishing village about five miles east of Genoa. Next we find the father,\r\nDomenico Colombo, owning a house at Quinto, but established at Genoa as\r\na wool weaver, with an apprentice. This was in 1439. A few years\r\nafterward Domenico found a wife in the family of a silk weaver who lived\r\nup a tributary valley of the Bisagno, within an easy walk of Genoa.\r\nQuezzi is a little village high up on the west side of a ravine, with\r\nslopes clothed to their summits in olive and chestnut foliage, whence\r\nthere is a glorious view of the east end of Genoa, including the church\r\nof Carignano and the Mediterranean. On the opposite slope are the\r\nscattered houses of the hamlet of Ginestrato. From this village of\r\nQuezzi Domenico brought his wife, Susanna Fontanarossa, to Genoa, her\r\ndowry consisting of a small property, a house or a field, at Ginestrato.\r\n\r\nAbout the home of Domenico and his wife at Genoa during at least twenty\r\nyears there is absolute certainty. The old gate of San Andrea is still\r\nstanding, with its lofty arch across the street, and its high flanking\r\ntowers. A street with a rapid downward slope, called the Vico Dritto di\r\nPonticelli, leads from the gate of San Andrea to the Church of S.\r\nStefano; and the house of Domenico Colombo was in this street, a few\r\ndoors from the gate. It was the weavers' quarter, and S. Stefano was\r\ntheir parish church, where they had a special altar. Domenico's house\r\nhad two stories besides the ground floor; and there was a back garden,\r\nwith a well between it and the city wall. It was battered down during\r\nthe bombardment of Genoa in the time of Louis XIV., was rebuilt with two\r\nadditional stories, and is now the property of the city of Genoa.\r\n\r\nThis was the house of the parents of Columbus, and at a solemn moment,\r\nshortly before his death, Columbus stated that he was born in the city\r\nof Genoa. No. 39 Vico Dritto di Ponticelli was therefore, in all\r\nprobability, the house where the great discoverer was born, and the old\r\nChurch of San Stefano, with its façade of alternate black and white\r\ncourses of marble, and its quaint old campanile, was the place of his\r\nbaptism. The date of his birth is fixed by three statements of his own,\r\nand by a justifiable inference from the notarial records. He said that\r\nhe went to sea at the age of fourteen, and that when he came to Spain in\r\n1485 he had led a sailor's life for twenty-three years. He was,\r\ntherefore, born in 1447. In 1501 he again said that it was forty years\r\nsince he first went to sea when he was fourteen; the same result--1447.\r\nIn 1503 he wrote that he first came to serve for the discovery of the\r\nIndies--that is, that he left his home at the age of twenty-eight. This\r\nwas in 1474, and the result is again 1447. The supporting notarial\r\nevidence is contained in two documents, in which the mother of Columbus\r\nconsented to the sale of property by her husband. For the first deed, in\r\nMay, 1471, the notary summoned her brothers to consent to the execution\r\nof the deed, as the nearest relations of full age. The second deed is\r\nwitnessed by her son Cristoforo in August, 1473. He must have attained\r\nthe legal age of twenty-five in the interval. This again makes 1447 the\r\nyear of his birth.\r\n\r\nThe authorities who assign 1436 as the year of his birth rely\r\nexclusively on the guess of a Spanish priest, Dr. Bernaldez, Cura of\r\nPalacios, who made the great discoverer's acquaintance toward the end of\r\nhis career. Bernaldez, judging from his aged appearance, thought that he\r\nmight be seventy years of age, more or less, when he died. The use of\r\nthe phrase \"more or less\" proves that Bernaldez had no information from\r\nColumbus himself, and that he merely guessed the years of the\r\nprematurely aged hero. This is not evidence. The three different\r\nstatements of Columbus, supported by the corroborative testimony of the\r\ndeeds of sale, form positive evidence, and fix the date of the birth at\r\n1447.\r\n\r\nWe know the place and date of the great discoverer's birth, thanks to\r\nthe researches of the Marchese Staglieno. The notarial records, combined\r\nwith incidental statements of Columbus himself, also tell us that he was\r\nbrought up, with his brothers and sister, in the Vico Dritto at Genoa;\r\nthat he worked at his father's trade and became a \"lanerio,\" or wool\r\nweaver; that he moved with his father and mother to Savona in 1472; and\r\nthat the last document connecting Cristoforo Colombo with Italy is dated\r\non August 7, 1473. After that date--doubtless very soon after that date,\r\nwhen he is described as a wool weaver of Genoa--Columbus went to\r\nPortugal, at the age of twenty-eight. But we also know that, in spite of\r\nhis regular business as a weaver, he first went to sea in 1461, at the\r\nage of fourteen, and that he continued to make frequent voyages in the\r\nMediterranean and the Archipelago--certainly as far as Chios--although\r\nhis regular trade was that of a weaver.\r\n\r\nThis is not a mere question of places and dates. These facts enable us\r\nto form an idea of the circumstances surrounding the youth and early\r\nmanhood of the future discoverer, of his training, of the fuel which\r\nlighted the fire of his genius, and of the difficulties which surrounded\r\nhim. Moreover, a knowledge of the real facts serves to clear away all\r\nthe misleading fables about student life at Pavia, about service with\r\nimaginary uncles who were corsairs or admirals, and about galleys\r\ncommanded for King Réné. Some of these fables are due to the mistaken\r\npiety of the great discoverer's son Hernando, and to others, who seem\r\nto have thought that they were doing honor to the memory of the Admiral\r\nby surrounding his youth with romantic stories. But the simple truth is\r\nfar more honorable, and, indeed, far more romantic. It shows us the\r\nyoung weaver loving his home and serving his parents with filial\r\ndevotion, but at the same time preparing, with zeal and industry, to\r\nbecome an expert in the profession for which he was best fitted, and\r\neven in his earliest youth making ready to fulfill his high destiny.\r\n\r\nI believe that Columbus had conceived the idea of sailing westward to\r\nthe Indies even before he left his home at Savona. My reason is, that\r\nhis correspondence with Toscanelli on the subject took place in the very\r\nyear of his arrival in Portugal. That fact alone involves the position\r\nthat the young weaver had not only become a practical seaman--well\r\nversed in all the astronomical knowledge necessary for his profession--a\r\ncosmographer, and a draughtsman, but also that he had carefully digested\r\nwhat he had learned, and had formed original conceptions. It seems\r\nwonderful that a humble weaver's apprentice could have done all this in\r\nthe intervals of his regular work. Assuredly it is most wonderful; but I\r\nsubmit that his correspondence with Toscanelli in 1474 proves it to be a\r\nfact. We know that there were the means of acquiring such knowledge at\r\nGenoa in those days; that city was indeed the center of the nautical\r\nscience of the day. Benincasa, whose beautiful _Portolani_ may still be\r\nseen at the British Museum, and in other collections, was in the height\r\nof his fame as a draughtsman at Genoa during the youth of Columbus; so\r\nwas Pareto. In the workrooms of these famous cartographers the young\r\naspirant would see the most accurate charts that could then be produced,\r\nvery beautifully executed; and his imagination would be excited by the\r\nappearance of all the fabulous islands on the verge of the unknown\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nWhen the time arrived for Columbus to leave his home, he naturally chose\r\nLisbon as the point from whence he could best enlarge his experience and\r\nmature his plans. Ever since he could remember he had seen the\r\ninscriptions respecting members of the Pasagni family, as we may see\r\nthem now, carved on the white courses of the west front of San Stefano,\r\nhis parish church. These Genoese Pasagni had been hereditary Admirals of\r\nPortugal; they had brought many Genoese seamen to Lisbon; the Cross of\r\nSt. George marked their exploits on the _Portolani_, and Portugal was\r\nthus closely connected with the tradition of Genoese enterprise. So it\r\nwas to Lisbon that Columbus and his brother made their way, and it was\r\nduring the ten years of his connection with Portugal that his\r\ncosmographical studies, and his ocean voyages from the equator to the\r\narctic circle, _combined with his genius to make Columbus the greatest\r\nseaman of his age_.\r\n\r\nCapt. Duro, of the Spanish navy, has investigated all questions relating\r\nto the ships of the Columbian period and their equipment with great\r\ncare; and the learning he has brought to bear on the subject has\r\nproduced very interesting results. The two small caravels provided for\r\nthe voyage of Columbus by the town of Palos were only partially decked.\r\nThe Pinta was strongly built, and was originally lateen-rigged on all\r\nthree masts, and she was the fastest sailer in the expedition; but she\r\nwas only fifty tons burden, with a complement of eighteen men. The Niña,\r\nso-called after the Niño family of Palos, who owned her, was still\r\nsmaller, being only forty tons. These two vessels were commanded by the\r\nPinzons, and entirely manned by natives of the province of Huelva. The\r\nthird vessel was much larger, and did not belong to Palos. She was\r\ncalled a \"nao,\" or ship, and was of about one hundred tons burden,\r\ncompletely decked, with a high poop and forecastle. Her length has been\r\nvariously estimated. Two of her masts had square sails, the mizzen being\r\nlateen-rigged. The foremast had a square foresail, the mainmast a\r\nmainsail and maintopsail, and there was a spritsail on the bowsprit. The\r\ncourses were enlarged, in fair weather, by lacing strips of canvas to\r\ntheir leeches, called _bonetas_. There appear to have been two boats,\r\none with a sail, and the ship was armed with lombards. The rigs of these\r\nvessels were admirably adapted for their purpose. The large courses of\r\nthe caravels enabled their commanders to lay their courses nearer to the\r\nwind than any clipper ship of modern times. The crew of the ship Santa\r\nMaria numbered fifty-two men all told, including the Admiral. She was\r\nowned by the renowned pilot Juan de la Cosa of Santoña, who sailed with\r\nColumbus on both his first and second voyages, and was the best\r\ndraughtsman in Spain. Mr. Harrisse, and even earlier writers, such as\r\nVianello, call him a Basque pilot, apparently because he came from the\r\nnorth of Spain; but Santoña, his birthplace, although on the coast of\r\nthe Bay of Biscay, is not in the Basque provinces; and if Juan de la\r\nCosa was a native of Santoña he was not a Basque. While the crews of the\r\ntwo caravels all came from Palos or its neighborhood, the men of the\r\nSanta Maria were recruited from all parts of Spain, two from Santoña\r\nbesides Juan de la Cosa, which was natural enough, and several others\r\nfrom northern ports, likewise attracted, in all probability, by the fame\r\nof the Santoña pilot. Among these it is very interesting to find an\r\nEnglishman, who came from the little town of Lajes, near Coruña.\r\n\r\nOur countryman is called in the list, \"Tallarte de Lajes\" (Inglés). It\r\nis not unlikely that an English sailor, making voyages from Bristol or\r\nfrom one of the Cinque Ports to Coruña, may have married and settled at\r\nLajes. But what can we make of \"Tallarte\"? Spaniards would be likely\r\nenough to prefix a \"T\" to any English name beginning with a vowel, and\r\nthey would be pretty sure to give the word a vowel termination. So,\r\ngetting rid of these initial and terminal superfluities, there remains\r\nAllart, or Alard. This was a famous name among the sailors of the Cinque\r\nPorts. Gervaise Alard of Winchelsea in 1306 was the first English\r\nadmiral; and there were Alards of Winchelsea for several generations,\r\nwho were renowned as expert and daring sailors. One of them, I believe,\r\nsailed with Columbus on his first voyage, and perished at Navidad.\r\n\r\nColumbus took with him the map furnished by Toscanelli. It is\r\nunfortunately lost. But the globe of Martin Behaim, drawn in 1492--the\r\nvery year of the sailing of Columbus--shows the state of knowledge on\r\nthe eve of the discovery of America. The lost map of Toscanelli must\r\nhave been very like it, with its islands in mid-Atlantic, and its\r\narchipelago grouped round Cipango, near the coast of Cathay. This globe\r\ndeserves close attention, for its details must be impressed on the minds\r\nof all who would understand what were the ideas and hopes of Columbus\r\nwhen he sailed from Palos.\r\n\r\nFriday, August 3, 1492, when the three little vessels sailed over the\r\nbar of Saltes, was a memorable day in the world's history. It had been\r\nprepared for by many years of study and labor, by long years of\r\ndisappointment and anxiety, rewarded at length by success. The proof was\r\nto be made at last. To the incidents of that famous voyage nothing can\r\nbe added. But we may, at least, settle the long-disputed question of the\r\nlandfall of Columbus. It is certainly an important question. There are\r\nthe materials for a final decision, and we ought to know for certain on\r\nwhat spot of land it was that the Admiral knelt when he sprang from the\r\nboat on that famous 12th of October, 1492.\r\n\r\nThe learned have disputed over the matter for a century, and no less\r\nthan five islands of the Bahama group have had their advocates. This is\r\nnot the fault of Columbus, albeit we only have an abstract of his\r\njournal. The island is there fully and clearly described, and courses\r\nand distances are given thence to Cuba, which furnish data for fixing\r\nthe landfall with precision. Here it is not a case for the learning and\r\nerudition of Navarretes, Humboldts, and Varnhagens. It is a sailor's\r\nquestion. If the materials from the journal were placed in the hands of\r\nany midshipman in her Majesty's navy, he would put his finger on the\r\ntrue landfall within half an hour. When sailors took the matter in hand,\r\nsuch as Admiral Becher, of the Hydrographic Office, and Lieut. Murdoch,\r\nof the United States navy, they did so.\r\n\r\nOur lamented associate, Mr. R. H. Major, read a paper on this\r\ninteresting subject on May 8, 1871, in which he proved that Watling's\r\nIsland was the Guanahani, or San Salvador, of Columbus. He did so by two\r\nlines of argument--the first being the exact agreement between the\r\ndescription of Guanahani, in the journal of Columbus, and Watling's\r\nIsland, a description which can not be referred to any other island in\r\nthe Bahama group; and the second being a comparison of the maps of Juan\r\nde la Cosa and of Herrera with modern charts. He showed that out of\r\ntwenty-four islands on the Herrera map of 1600, ten retain the same\r\nnames as they then had, thus affording stations for comparison; and the\r\nrelative bearings of these ten islands lead us to the accurate\r\nidentification of the rest. The shapes are not correct, but the relative\r\nbearings are, and the Guanahani of the Herrera map is thus identified\r\nwith the present Watling's Island. Mr. Major, by careful and minute\r\nattention to the words of the journal of Columbus, also established the\r\nexact position of the first anchorage as having been a little to the\r\nwest of the southeast point of Watling's Island.\r\n\r\nI can not leave the subject of Mr. Major's admirable paper without\r\nexpressing my sense of the loss sustained by comparative geography when\r\nhis well-known face, so genial and sympathetic, disappeared from among\r\nus. The biographer of Prince Henry the Navigator, Major did more than\r\nany other Englishman of this century to bring the authentic history of\r\nColumbus within the reach of his countrymen. His translations of the\r\nletters of the illustrious Genoese, and the excellent critical essay\r\nwhich preceded them, are indispensable to every English student of the\r\nhistory of geographical discovery who is not familiar with the Spanish\r\nlanguage, and most useful even to Spanish scholars. His knowledge of the\r\nhistory of cartography, his extensive and accurate scholarship, and his\r\nreadiness to impart his knowledge to others, made him a most valuable\r\nmember of the council of this society, and one whose place is not easy\r\nto fill; while there are not a few among the Fellows who, like myself,\r\nsincerely mourn the loss of a true and warmhearted friend.\r\n\r\nWhen we warmly applauded the close reasoning and the unassailable\r\nconclusions of Major's paper, we supposed that the question was at\r\nlength settled; but as time went on, arguments in favor of other islands\r\ncontinued to appear, and an American in a high official position even\r\nstarted a new island, contending that Samana was the landfall. But Fox's\r\nSamana and Varnhagen's Mayaguana must be ruled out of court without\r\nfurther discussion, for they both occur on the maps of Juan de la Cosa\r\nand Herrera, on which Guanahani also appears. It is obvious that they\r\ncan not be Guanahani and themselves at the same time; and it is perhaps\r\nneedless to add that they do not answer to the description of Guanahani\r\nby Columbus, and meet none of the other requirements.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion it may be well to identify the landfall by another\r\nmethod, and thus furnish some further strength to the arguments which\r\nought to put an end to the controversy. Major established the landfall\r\nby showing the identity between the Guanahani of Columbus and Watling's\r\nIsland, and by the evidence of early maps. There is still another\r\nmethod, which was adopted by Lieut. Murdoch, of the United States navy,\r\nin his very able paper. Columbus left Guanahani and sailed to his second\r\nisland, which he called Santa Maria de la Concepcion; and he gives the\r\nbearing and distance. He gives the bearing and distance from this second\r\nisland to the north end of a third, which he called Fernandina. He gives\r\nthe length of Fernandina. He gives the bearing and distance from the\r\nsouth end of Fernandina to a fourth island named Isabella, from Isabella\r\nto some rocks called Islas de Arena, and from Islas de Arena to Cuba.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if we trace these bearings and distances backward\r\nfrom Cuba, they will bring us to an island which must necessarily be the\r\nGuanahani, or San Salvador, of Columbus. This is the sailor's method: On\r\nOctober 27th, when Columbus sighted Cuba at a distance of 20 miles, the\r\nbearing of his anchorage at sunrise of the same day, off the Islas de\r\nArena, was N. E. 58 miles, and from the point reached in Cuba it was N.\r\nE. 75 miles. The Ragged Islands are 75 miles from Cuba, therefore the\r\nIslas de Arena of Columbus are identified with the Ragged Islands of\r\nmodern charts. The Islas de Arena were sighted when Columbus was 56\r\nmiles from the south end of Fernandina, and E.N.E. from Isabella. These\r\nbearings show that Fernandina was Long Island, and that Isabella was\r\nCrooked Island, of modern charts. Fernandina was 20 leagues long N. N.\r\nW. and S. S. E.; Long Island is 20 leagues long N. N. W. and S. S. E.\r\nSanta Maria de la Concepcion was several miles east of the north end of\r\nFernandina, but in sight. Rum Cay is several miles east of the north\r\nend of Long Island, but in sight. Rum Cay is, therefore, the Santa Maria\r\nof Columbus. San Salvador, or Guanahani, was 21 miles N. W. from Santa\r\nMaria de la Concepcion. Watling's Island is 21 miles N. W. from Rum Cay;\r\nWatling's Island is, therefore, proved to be the San Salvador, or\r\nGuanahani, of Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe spot where Columbus first landed in the New World is the eastern end\r\nof the south side of Watling's Island. This has been established by the\r\narguments of Major, and by the calculations of Murdoch, beyond all\r\ncontroversy. The evidence is overwhelming. Watling's Island answers to\r\nevery requirement and every test, whether based on the Admiral's\r\ndescription of the island itself, on the courses and distances thence to\r\nCuba, or on the evidence of early maps. We have thus reached a final and\r\nsatisfactory conclusion, and we can look back on that momentous event in\r\nthe world's history with the certainty that we know the exact spot on\r\nwhich it occurred--on which Columbus touched the land when he sprang\r\nfrom his boat with the standard waving over his head.[48]\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Columbus during his first voyage, as recorded in his\r\njournal, included part of the north coast of Cuba, and the whole of the\r\nnorth coast of Española. The journal shows the care with which the\r\nnavigation was conducted, how observations for latitude were taken, how\r\nthe coasts were laid down--every promontory and bay receiving a\r\nname--and with what diligence each new feature of the land and its\r\ninhabitants was examined and recorded. The genius of Columbus would not\r\nhave been of the same service to mankind if it had not been combined\r\nwith great capacity for taking trouble, and with habits of order and\r\naccuracy. In considering the qualities of the great Genoese as a seaman\r\nand an explorer, we can not fail to be impressed with this accuracy, the\r\nresult of incessant watchfulness and of orderly habits. Yet it is his\r\naccuracy which has been called in question by some modern writers, on\r\nthe ground of passages in his letters which they have misinterpreted, or\r\nfailed to understand. In every instance the blunder has not been\r\ncommitted by Columbus, but by his critics.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral's letters do not show him to be either careless or\r\ninaccurate. On the contrary, they bear witness to his watchfulness, to\r\nhis methodical habits, and to his attention to details; although at the\r\nsame time they are full of speculations, and of the thoughts which\r\nfollowed each other so rapidly in his imaginative brain. It was, indeed,\r\nthe combination of these two qualities, of practical and methodical\r\nhabits of thought with a vivid imagination, which constituted his\r\ngenius--a combination as rare as it is valuable. It created the thoughts\r\nwhich conceived the great discovery, as well as the skill and ability\r\nwhich achieved it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the journals and charts of Columbus are lost. But we have\r\nthe full abstract of the journal of his first voyage, made by Las Casas,\r\nwe have his letters and dispatches, and we have the map of his\r\ndiscoveries, except those made during his last voyage, drawn by his own\r\npilot and draughtsman, Juan de la Cosa. We are thus able to obtain a\r\nsufficient insight into the system on which his exploring voyages were\r\nconducted, and into the sequence in which his discoveries followed each\r\nother. This is the point of view from which the labors of the Admiral\r\nare most interesting to geographers. The deficient means at the disposal\r\nof a navigator in the end of the fifteenth century increase the\r\nnecessity for a long apprenticeship. It is much easier to become a\r\nnavigator with the aid of modern instruments constructed with extreme\r\naccuracy, and with tables of logarithms, nautical almanacs, and\r\nadmiralty charts. With ruder appliances Columbus and his contemporaries\r\nhad to trust far more to their own personal skill and watchfulness, and\r\nto ways of handling and using such instruments as they possessed, which\r\ncould only be acquired by constant practice and the experience of a\r\nlifetime. _Even then, an insight and ability which few men possess were\r\nrequired to make such a navigator as Columbus._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF ANTONIO DE HERRERA, THE HISTORIAN OF COLUMBUS.\r\n(See page 220.)]\r\n\r\nThe first necessity for a pilot who conducts a ship across the ocean,\r\nwhen he is for many days out of sight of land, is the means of checking\r\nhis dead reckoning by observations of the heavenly bodies. But in the\r\ndays of Columbus such appliances were very defective, and, at times,\r\naltogether useless. There was an astrolabe adapted for use at sea by\r\nMartin Behaim, but it was very difficult to get a decent sight with it,\r\nand Vasco da Gama actually went on shore and rigged a triangle when he\r\nwanted to observe for latitude. If this was necessary, the instrument\r\nwas useless as a guide across the pathless ocean. Columbus, of\r\ncourse, used it, but he seems to have relied more upon the old\r\nquadrant which he had used for long years before Behaim invented his\r\nadaption of the astrolabe. It was this instrument, the value of which\r\nreceived such warm testimony from Diogo Gomez, one of Prince Henry's\r\nnavigators; and it was larger and easier to handle than the astrolabe.\r\nBut the difficulty, as regards both these instruments,[49] was the\r\nnecessity for keeping them perpendicular to the horizon when the\r\nobservation is taken, in one case by means of a ring working freely, and\r\nin the other by a plummet line. The instruction of old Martin Cortes was\r\nto sit down with your back against the mainmast; but in reality the only\r\nman who obtained results of any use from such instruments was he who had\r\nbeen constantly working with them from early boyhood. In those days, far\r\nmore than now, a good pilot had to be brought up at sea from his youth.\r\nLong habit could alone make up, to a partial extent, for defective\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nColumbus regularly observed for latitude when the weather rendered it\r\npossible, and he occasionally attempted to find the longitude by\r\nobserving eclipses of the moon with the aid of tables calculated by old\r\nRegiomontanus, whose declination tables also enabled the Admiral to work\r\nout his meridian altitudes. But the explorer's main reliance was on the\r\nskill and care with which he calculated his dead reckoning, watching\r\nevery sign offered by sea and sky by day and night, allowing for\r\ncurrents, for leeway, for every cause that could affect the movement of\r\nhis ship, noting with infinite pains the bearings and the variation of\r\nhis compass, and constantly recording all phenomena on his card and in\r\nhis journal. _Columbus was the true father of what we call proper\r\npilotage._\r\n\r\nIt is most interesting to watch the consequences of this seaman-like and\r\nmost conscientious care in the results of his voyages of discovery. We\r\nhave seen with what accuracy he made his landfall at the Azores, on his\r\nreturn from his first and most memorable voyage. The incidents of his\r\nsecond voyage are equally instructive. He had heard from the natives of\r\nthe eastern end of Española that there were numerous islands to the\r\nsoutheast inhabited by savage tribes of Caribs, and when he sailed from\r\nSpain on his second voyage he resolved to ascertain the truth of the\r\nreport before proceeding to his settlement at Navidad. He shaped such a\r\ncourse as to hit upon Dominica, and within a few weeks he discovered the\r\nwhole of the Windward Islands, thence to Puerto Rico. On his return his\r\nspirit of investigation led him to try the possibility of making a\r\npassage in the teeth of the trade-wind. It was a long voyage, and his\r\npeople were reduced to the last extremity, even threatening to eat the\r\nIndians who were on board. One night, to the surprise of all the\r\ncompany, the Admiral gave the order to shorten sail. Next morning, at\r\ndawn, Cape St. Vincent was in sight. This is a remarkable proof of the\r\ncare with which his reckoning must have been kept, and of his consummate\r\nskill as a navigator. On his third voyage he decided, for various\r\nreasons, to make further discoveries nearer to the equator, the result\r\nof his decision being the exploration of the Gulf of Paria, including\r\nthe coast of Trinidad and of the continent. His speculations, although\r\nsometimes fantastic, and originating in a too vivid imagination, were\r\nusually shrewd and carefully thought out. Thus they led from one\r\ndiscovery to another; and even when, through want of complete knowledge,\r\nthere was a flaw in the chain of his reasoning, the results were equally\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nA memorable example of an able and acute train of thought, based on\r\nobservations at sea, was that which led to his last voyage in search of\r\na strait. He had watched the gulf stream constantly flowing in a\r\nwesterly direction, and he thought that he had ascertained, as the\r\nresult of careful observation, that the islands in the course of the\r\ncurrent had their lengths east and west, owing to erosion on their north\r\nand south sides. From this fact he deduced the constancy of the current.\r\nHis own pilot, Juan de la Cosa, serving under Ojeda and Bastidas, had\r\nestablished the continuity of land from the Gulf of Paria to Darien. The\r\nAdmiral himself had explored the coast of Cuba, both on the north and\r\nsouth sides, for so great a distance that he concluded it must surely be\r\na promontory connected with the continent. The conclusion was that, as\r\nit could not turn to north or south, this current, ever flowing in one\r\ndirection, must pass through a strait. The argument was perfectly sound\r\nexcept in one point--the continental character of Cuba was an\r\nhypothesis, not an ascertained fact.\r\n\r\nStill, it was a brilliant chain of reasoning, and it led to a great\r\nresult, though not to the expected result. Just as the search for the\r\nphilosopher's stone led to valuable discoveries in chemistry, and as the\r\nsearch for El Dorado revealed the courses of the two largest rivers in\r\nSouth America, so the Admiral's heroic effort to discover a strait in\r\nthe face of appalling difficulties, in advancing years and failing\r\nhealth, made known the coast of the continent from Honduras to Darien.\r\n\r\nAll the discoveries made by others, in the lifetime of Columbus, on the\r\ncoasts of the western continent (except that of Cabral) were directly\r\ndue to the first voyage of the Admiral, to his marvelous prevision in\r\nboldly sailing westward across the sea of darkness, and are to be\r\nclassed as Columbian discoveries. This was clearly laid down by Las\r\nCasas, in a noble passage. \"The Admiral was the first to open the gates\r\nof that ocean which had been closed for so many thousands of years\r\nbefore,\" exclaimed the good bishop. \"He it was who gave the light by\r\nwhich all others might see how to discover. It can not be denied to the\r\nAdmiral, except with great injustice, that _as_ he was the first\r\ndiscoverer of those Indies, _so_ he was really of all the mainland; and\r\nto him the credit is due. For it was he that put the thread into the\r\nhands of the rest by which they found the clew to more distant parts. It\r\nwas not necessary for this that he should personally visit every part,\r\nany more than it is necessary to do so in taking possession of an\r\nestate; as the jurists hold.\" This generous protest by Las Casas should\r\nreceive the assent of all geographers. The pupils and followers of\r\nColumbus, such as Pinzon, Ojeda, Niño, and La Cosa, discovered all the\r\ncontinent from 8 deg. S. of the equator to Darien, thus supplementing\r\ntheir great master's work; while he himself led the way, and showed the\r\nlight both to the islands and to the continent.\r\n\r\nAlthough none of the charts of Columbus have come down to us, there\r\nstill exists a map of all discoveries up to the year 1500, drawn by the\r\npilot Juan de la Cosa, who accompanied him in his first and second\r\nvoyages, and sailed with Ojeda on a separate expedition in 1499, when\r\nthe coast of the continent was explored from the Gulf of Paria to Cabo\r\nde la Vela. Juan de la Cosa drew this famous map of the world (which is\r\npreserved at Madrid) at Santa Maria, in the Bay of Cadiz, when he\r\nreturned from his expedition with Ojeda in 1500. It is drawn in color,\r\non oxhide, and measures 5 feet 9 inches by 3 feet 2 inches. La Cosa\r\nshows the islands discovered by Columbus, but it is difficult to\r\nunderstand what he could have been thinking about in placing them north\r\nof the tropic of cancer. The continent is delineated from 8 deg. S. of\r\nthe equator to Cabo de la Vela, which was the extreme point to which\r\ndiscovery had reached in 1500; and over the undiscovered part to the\r\nwest, which the Admiral himself was destined to bring to the knowledge\r\nof the world a few years afterward, Juan de la Cosa painted a vignette\r\nof St. Christopher bearing the infant Christ across the ocean. But the\r\nmost important part of the map is that on which the discoveries of John\r\nCabot are shown, for this is the only map which shows them. It is true\r\nthat a map, or a copy of a map, of 1542, by Sebastian Cabot, was\r\ndiscovered of late years, and is now at Paris, and that it indicates the\r\n\"Prima Vista,\" the first land seen by Cabot on his voyage of 1497; but\r\nit shows the later work of Jacques Cartier and other explorers, and does\r\nnot show what part was due to Cabot. Juan de la Cosa, however, must have\r\nreceived, through the Spanish ambassador in London, the original chart\r\nof Cabot, showing his discoveries during his second voyage in 1498, and\r\nwas enabled thus to include the new coast-line on his great map.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic labor wore out his body. But his mind was as active as\r\never. He had planned an attempt to recover the Holy Sepulcher. He had\r\nthought out a scheme for an Arctic expedition, including a plan for\r\nreaching the north pole, which he deposited in the monastery of\r\nMejorada. It was not to be. When he returned from his last voyage, he\r\ncame home to die. We gather some idea of the Admiral's personal\r\nappearance from the descriptions of Las Casas and Oviedo. He was a man\r\nof middle height, with courteous manners and noble bearing. His face was\r\noval, with a pleasing expression; the nose aquiline, the eyes blue, and\r\nthe complexion fair and inclined to ruddiness. The hair was red, though\r\nit became gray soon after he was thirty. Only one authentic portrait of\r\nColumbus is known to have been painted. The Italian historian, Paulus\r\nJovius, who was his contemporary, collected a gallery of portraits of\r\nworthies of his time at his villa on the Lake of Como. Among them was a\r\nportrait of the Admiral. There is an early engraving from it, and very\r\nindifferent copies in the Uffizi at Florence, and at Madrid. But until\r\nquite recently I do not think that the original was known to exist. It,\r\nhowever, never left the family, and when the last Giovio died it was\r\ninherited by her grandson, the Nobile de Orché, who is the present\r\npossessor. We have the head of a venerable man, with thin gray hair, the\r\nforehead high, the eyes pensive and rather melancholy. It was thus that\r\nhe doubtless appeared during the period that he was in Spain, after his\r\nreturn in chains, or during the last year of his life.\r\n\r\nIn his latter years we see Columbus, although as full as ever of his\r\ngreat mission, thinking more and more of the transmission of his rights\r\nand his property intact to his children. He had always loved his home,\r\nand his amiable and affectionate disposition made many and lasting\r\nfriendships in all ranks of life, from Queen Isabella and Archbishop\r\nDeza to the humblest _grumete_. We find his shipmates serving with him\r\nover and over again. Terreros, the Admiral's steward, and Salcedo, his\r\nservant, were with him in his first voyage and in his last. His faithful\r\ncaptains, Mendez and Fieschi, risked life and limb for him, and attended\r\nhim on his deathbed. Columbus was also blessed with two loving and\r\ndevoted brothers. In one of his letters to his son Diego, he said,\r\n\"Never have I found better friends, on my right hand and on my left,\r\nthan my brothers.\" Bartholomew, especially, was his trusty and gallant\r\ndefender and counselor in his darkest hours of difficulty and distress,\r\nhis nurse in sickness, and his helpful companion in health. The enduring\r\naffection of these two brothers, from the cradle to the grave, is most\r\ntouching. Columbus was happy too in his handsome, promising young sons,\r\nwho were ever dutiful, and whose welfare was his fondest care; they\r\nfulfilled all his hopes. One recovered the Admiral's rights, while the\r\nother studied his father's professional work, preserved his memorials,\r\nand wrote his life. Columbus never forgot his old home at Genoa, and the\r\nmost precious treasures of the proud city are the documents which her\r\nillustrious son confided to her charge, and the letters in which he\r\nexpressed his affection for his native town. Columbus was a man to\r\nreverence, but he was still more a man to love.\r\n\r\nThe great discoverer's genius was a gift which is only produced once in\r\nan age, and it is that which has given rise to the enthusiastic\r\ncelebration of the fourth centenary of his achievement. To geographers\r\nand sailors the careful study of his life will always be useful and\r\ninstructive. They will be led to ponder over the deep sense of duty and\r\nresponsibility which produced his unceasing and untiring watchfulness\r\nwhen at sea, over the long training which could alone produce so\r\nconsummate a navigator, and over that perseverance and capacity for\r\ntaking trouble which we should all not only admire but strive to\r\nimitate. I can not better conclude this very inadequate attempt to do\r\njustice to a great subject than by quoting the words of a geographer,\r\nwhose loss from among us we still continue to feel--the late Sir Henry\r\nYule. He said of Columbus: \"His genius and lofty enthusiasm, his ardent\r\nand justified previsions, mark the great Admiral as one of the lights of\r\nthe human race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISCOVERY GREATER THAN THE LABORS OF HERCULES.\r\n\r\n     PIETRO MARTIRE DE ANGHIERA (usually called Peter Martyr), an\r\n     Italian scholar, statesman, and historian.

I\r\nmyself wished to make the venture, and to dispatch him from my port\r\n[Santa Maria], where I had a good equipment of three or four caravels,\r\n_since he asked no more from me_; but as I recognized that this was an\r\nundertaking for the Queen, our sovereign, I wrote about the matter to\r\nher Highness from Rota, and she replied that I should send him to her.\r\nTherefore I sent him, and asked her Highness that, since I did not\r\ndesire to pursue the enterprise but had arranged it for her service, she\r\nshould direct that compensation be made to me, and that I might have a\r\nshare in it by having the loading and unloading of the commerce done in\r\nthe port.\r\n\r\nHer Highness received him [Colon], and referred him to Alonso de\r\nQuintanilla, who, in turn, _wrote me that he did not consider this\r\naffair to be very certain_; but that if it should go through, her\r\nHighness would give me a reward and part in it. After having well\r\nstudied it, she agreed to send him in search of the Indies. Some eight\r\nmonths ago he set out, and now has arrived at Lisbon on his return\r\nvoyage, and has found all which he sought and very completely; which, as\r\nsoon as I knew, in order to advise her Highness of such good tidings, I\r\nam writing by Inares and sending him to beg that she grant me the\r\nprivilege of sending out there each year some of my own caravels.\r\n\r\nI entreat your Lordship that you may be pleased to assist me in this,\r\nand also ask it in my behalf; since on my account, and through my\r\nkeeping him [Colon] _two years in my house_, and having placed him at\r\nher Majesty's service, so great a thing as this has come to pass; and\r\nbecause Inares will inform your Lordship more in detail, I beg you to\r\nhearken to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS STATUE, CITY OF MEXICO.\r\n\r\nThe Columbus monument, in the Paseo de la Reforma, in the City of\r\nMexico, was erected at the charges of Don Antonio Escandon, to whose\r\npublic spirit and enterprise the building of the Vera Cruz & Mexico\r\nRailway was due. The monument is the work of the French sculptor\r\nCordier. The base is a large platform of basalt, surrounded by a\r\nbalustrade of iron, above which are five lanterns. From this base rises\r\na square mass of red marble, ornamented with four _basso-relievos_; the\r\narms of Columbus, surrounded with garlands of laurels; the rebuilding of\r\nthe monastery of Santa Maria de la Rábida; the discovery of the Island\r\nof San Salvador; a fragment of a letter from Columbus to Raphael\r\nSanchez, beneath which is the dedication of the monument by Señor\r\nEscandon. Above the _basso-relievos_, surrounding the pedestals, are\r\nfour life-size figures in bronze; in front and to the right of the\r\nstatue of Columbus (that stands upon a still higher plane), Padre Juan\r\nPerez de la Marchena, prior of the Monastery of Santa Maria de la\r\nRábida, at Huelva, Spain; in front and to the left, Padre Fray Diego de\r\nDeza, friar of the Order of Saint Dominic, professor of theology at the\r\nConvent of St. Stephen, and afterward archbishop of Seville. He was also\r\nconfessor of King Ferdinand, to the support of which two men Columbus\r\nowed the royal favor; in the rear, to the right, Fray Pedro de Gante; in\r\nthe rear, to the left, Fray Bartolomé de las Casas--the two missionaries\r\nwho most earnestly gave their protection to the Indians, and the latter\r\nthe historian of Columbus. Crowning the whole, upon a pedestal of red\r\nmarble, is the figure of Columbus, in the act of drawing aside the veil\r\nthat hides the New World. In conception and in treatment this work is\r\nadmirable; charming in sentiment, and technically good. The monument\r\nstands in a little garden inclosed by iron chains hung upon posts of\r\nstone, around which extends a large _glorieta_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUTE OF JOAQUIN MILLER.\r\n\r\n     JOAQUIN (CINCINNATUS HEINE) MILLER, \"the Poet of the Sierras.\" Born\r\n     in Cincinnati, Ohio, November 10, 1842.

THOMAS J. MORGAN, Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In an\r\n     article, \"Columbus and the Indians,\" in the New York _Independent_,\r\n     June 2, 1892.\r\n\r\nColumbus, when he landed, was confronted with an Indian problem, which\r\nhe handed down to others, and they to us. Four hundred years have rolled\r\nby, and it is still unsolved. Who were the strange people who met him at\r\nthe end of his long and perilous voyage? He guessed at it and missed it\r\nby the diameter of the globe. He called them Indians--people of\r\nIndia--and thus registered the fifteenth century attainments in\r\ngeography and anthropology. How many were there of them? Alas! there was\r\nno census bureau here then, and no record has come down to us of any\r\ncount or enumeration. Would they have lived any longer if they had been\r\ncounted? Would a census have strengthened them to resist the threatened\r\ntide of invaders that the coming of Columbus heralded? If instead of\r\ncorn they had presented census rolls to their strange visitors, and\r\nexhibited maps to show that the continent was already occupied, would\r\nthat have changed the whole course of history and left us without any\r\nMayflower or Plymouth Rock, Bunker Hill or Appomattox?\r\n\r\n\r\nINTENSE UNCERTAINTY.\r\n\r\n     CHARLES MORRIS, an American writer of the present day. In \"Half\r\n     Hours with American History.\"\r\n\r\nThe land was clearly seen about two leagues distant, whereupon they took\r\nin sail and waited impatiently for the dawn. The thoughts and feelings\r\nof Columbus in this little space of time must have been tumultuous and\r\nintense. At length, in spite of every difficulty and danger, he had\r\naccomplished his object. The great mystery of the ocean was revealed;\r\nhis theory, which had been the scoff of sages, was triumphantly\r\nestablished; he secured to himself a glory durable as the world itself.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive the feelings of such a man at such a moment,\r\nor the conjectures which must have thronged upon his mind as to the land\r\nbefore him, covered with darkness. A thousand speculations must have\r\nswarmed upon him, as with his anxious crews he waited for the night to\r\npass away, wondering whether the morning light would reveal a savage\r\nwilderness, or dawn upon spicy groves and glittering fanes and gilded\r\ncities, and all the splendor of oriental civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST TO GREET COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     EMMA HUNTINGTON NASON. A poem in _St. Nicholas_, July, 1892,\r\n     founded upon the incident of Columbus' finding a red thorn bush\r\n     floating in the water a few days before sighting Watling's Island.\r\n\r\n  When the feast is spread in our country's name,\r\n    When the nations are gathered from far and near,\r\n  When East and West send up the same\r\n    Glad shout, and call to the lands, \"Good cheer!\"\r\n  When North and South shall give their bloom,\r\n    The fairest and best of the century born.\r\n  Oh, then for the king of the feast make room!\r\n    Make room, we pray, for the scarlet thorn!\r\n\r\n  Not the golden-rod from the hillsides blest,\r\n    Not the pale arbutus from pastures rare,\r\n  Nor the waving wheat from the mighty West,\r\n    Nor the proud magnolia, tall and fair,\r\n  Shall Columbia unto the banquet bring.\r\n    They, willing of heart, shall stand and wait,\r\n  For the thorn, with his scarlet crown, is king.\r\n    Make room for him at the splendid fête!\r\n\r\n  Do we not remember the olden tale?\r\n    And that terrible day of dark despair,\r\n  When Columbus, under the lowering sail,\r\n    Sent out to the hidden lands his prayer?\r\n  And was it not he of the scarlet bough\r\n    Who first went forth from the shore to greet\r\n  That lone grand soul at the vessel's prow,\r\n    Defying fate with his tiny fleet?\r\n\r\n  Grim treachery threatened, above, below,\r\n    And death stood close at the captain's side,\r\n  When he saw--Oh, joy!--in the sunset glow,\r\n    The thorn-tree's branch o'er the waters glide.\r\n  \"Land! Land ahead!\" was the joyful shout;\r\n    The vesper hymn o'er the ocean swept;\r\n  The mutinous sailors faced about;\r\n    Together they fell on their knees and wept.\r\n\r\n  At dawn they landed with pennons white;\r\n    They kissed the sod of San Salvador;\r\n  But dearer than gems on his doublet bright\r\n    Were the scarlet berries their leader bore;\r\n  Thorny and sharp, like his future crown,\r\n    Blood-red, like the wounds in his great heart made,\r\n  Yet an emblem true of his proud renown\r\n    Whose glorious colors shall never fade.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBA CHRISTUM-FERENS--WHAT'S IN A NAME?\r\n\r\n     New Orleans _Morning Star and Catholic Messenger_, August 13, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe poet says that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but\r\nthere is no doubt that certain names are invested with a peculiar\r\nsignificance. It would appear also that this significance is not always\r\na mere chance coincidence, but is intended, sometimes, to carry the\r\nevidence of an overruling prevision. Christopher Columbus was not so\r\nnamed _after_ his achievements, like Scipio Africanus. The name was his\r\nfrom infancy, though human ingenuity could not have conceived one more\r\nwonderfully suggestive of his after career.\r\n\r\nColumba means a dove. Was there anything dove-like about Columbus?\r\nPerhaps not, originally, but his many years of disappointment and\r\nhumiliation, of poverty and contempt, of failure and hopelessness, were\r\nthe best school in which to learn patience and sweetness under the\r\nguiding hand of such teachers as faith and piety. Was anything wanting\r\nto perfect him in the unresisting gentleness of the dove? If so, his\r\nguardian angel saw to it when he sent him back in chains from the scenes\r\nof his triumph. He then and there, by his meekness, established his\r\nindefeasible right to the name _Columbus_--the right of conquest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WEST INDIES]\r\n\r\nAnd Christopher--_Christum-ferens_--the Christ-bearer? A saint of old\r\nwas so called because one day he carried the child Christ on his\r\nshoulders across a dangerous ford. People called him _Christo-pher_. But\r\nwhat shall we say of the man who carried Christ across the stormy\r\nterrors of the unknown sea? Wherever the modern Christopher landed,\r\nthere he planted the cross; his first act was always one of devout\r\nworship. And now that cross and that worship are triumphant from end to\r\nend, and from border to border, of that New World. The very fairest\r\nflower of untrammeled freedom in the diadem of the Christian church is\r\nto-day blooming within the mighty domain which this instrument of\r\nProvidence wrested from the malign sway of error. Shall not that New\r\nWorld greet him as the Christ-bearer? Indeed, there must have been more\r\nthan an accidental coincidence when, half a century in advance of\r\nevents, the priest, in pouring the sacred waters of baptism, proclaimed\r\nthe presence of one who was to be truly a Christopher--one who should\r\ncarry Christ on the wings of a dove.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR LETTER OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF NEW ORLEANS ON THE CHRISTOPHER\r\nCOLUMBUS CELEBRATION.\r\n\r\n     From the _Morning Star and Catholic Messenger_, New Orleans, August\r\n     13, 1892.\r\n\r\nREVEREND AND DEAR FATHER: The fourth centenary of the discovery of\r\nAmerica by Christopher Columbus is at hand. It is an event of the\r\ngreatest importance. It added a new continent to the world for\r\ncivilization and Christianity; it gave our citizens a home of liberty\r\nand freedom, a country of plenty and prosperity, a fatherland which has\r\na right to our deepest and best feelings of attachment and affection.\r\nChristopher Columbus was a sincere and devout Catholic; his remarkable\r\nvoyage was made possible by the intercession of a holy monk; and by the\r\npatronage and liberality of the pious Queen Isabella, the cross of\r\nChrist, the emblem of our holy religion, was planted on America's virgin\r\nsoil, and the _Te Deum_ and the holy mass were the first religious\r\nservices held on the same; it is therefore just and proper that this\r\ngreat event and festival should be celebrated in a religious as well as\r\nin a civil manner.\r\n\r\nOur Holy Father the Pope has appointed the 12th of October, and His\r\nExcellency the President of the United States has assigned the 21st of\r\nOctober, as the day of commemoration. The discrepancy of dates is based\r\non the difference of the two calendars. When Columbus discovered this\r\ncountry, the old Julian calendar was in vogue, and the date of discovery\r\nwas marked the 12th; but Pope Gregory XIII. introduced the Gregorian\r\ncalendar, according to which the 21st would now be the date. We will\r\navail ourselves of both dates--the first date to be of a religious, the\r\nsecond of a civil, character. We therefore order that on the 12th of\r\nOctober a solemn votive mass (_pro gratiarum actione dicendo Missam\r\nvotivam de S. S. Trinitate_), in honor of the Blessed Trinity, be sung\r\nin all the churches of the diocese, at an hour convenient to the parish,\r\nwith an exhortation to the people, as thanksgiving to God for all his\r\nfavors and blessings, and as a supplication to Him for the continuance\r\nof the same, and that all the citizens of this vast country may ever\r\ndwell in peace and union.\r\n\r\nLet the 21st be a public holiday. We desire that the children of our\r\nschools assemble in their Sunday clothes at their school-rooms or halls,\r\nand that after a few appropriate prayers some exercises be organized to\r\ncommemorate the great event, and at the same time to fire their young\r\nhearts with love of country, and with love for the religion of the cross\r\nof Christ, which Columbus planted on the American shore. We further\r\ndesire that the different Catholic organizations and societies arrange\r\nsome programme by which the day may be spent in an agreeable and\r\ninstructive manner.\r\n\r\nFor our archiepiscopal city we make these special arrangements: On the\r\n12th, at half-past 7 o'clock P. M., the cathedral will be open to the\r\npublic; the clergy of the city is invited to assemble at 7 o'clock, at\r\nthe archbishopric, to march in procession to the cathedral, where short\r\nsermons of ten minutes each will be preached in five different\r\nlanguages--Spanish, French, English, German, and Italian. The ceremony\r\nwill close with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and the solemn\r\nsinging of the _Te Deum_. In order to celebrate the civil solemnity of\r\nthe 21st, we desire that a preliminary meeting be held at St. Alphonsus'\r\nHall, on Monday evening, the 22d of August, at 8 o'clock. The meeting\r\nwill be composed of the pastors of the city, of two members of each\r\ncongregation--to be appointed by them--and of the presidents of the\r\nvarious Catholic societies. This body shall arrange the plan how to\r\ncelebrate the 21st of October.\r\n\r\nMay God, who has been kind and merciful to our people in the past,\r\ncontinue his favors in the future and lead us unto life everlasting.\r\n\r\nThe pastors will read this letter to their congregations.\r\n\r\nGiven from our archiepiscopal residence, Feast of St. Dominic, August\r\nthe 4th, 1892.\r\n\r\n   FRANCIS JANSSENS,\r\n  _Archbishop of New Orleans_.\r\n\r\n  By order of His Grace:\r\n  J. BOGAERTS, _Vicar-general_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMBUS STATUE IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK\r\n\r\nStands at the Eighth Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street entrance to Central\r\nPark, and was erected October 12, 1892, by subscription among the\r\nItalian citizens of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central\r\nAmerica. From a base forty-six feet square springs a beautiful shaft of\r\ngreat height, the severity of outline being broken by alternating lines\r\nof figures, in relief, of the prows, or rostra, of the three ships of\r\nColumbus, and medallions composed of an anchor and a coil of rope. In\r\nJuly, 1889, Chevalier Charles Barsotti, proprietor of the _Progresso\r\nItalo-Americano_, published in New York City, started a subscription to\r\ndefray the cost, which was liberally added to by the Italian government.\r\nOn December 10, 1890, a number of models were placed on exhibition at\r\nthe rooms of the Palace of the Exposition of Arts in Rome, and the\r\ncommission finally chose that of Prof. Gaetano Russo.\r\n\r\nThe monument is seventy-five feet high, including the three great\r\nblocks, or steps, which form the foundation; and, aside from the\r\nhistorical interest it may have, as a work of art alone its possession\r\nmight well be envied by any city or nation. The base, of Baveno granite,\r\nhas two beautiful bas-relief pictures in bronze, representing on one\r\nside the moment when Columbus first saw land, and on the other the\r\nactual landing of the party on the soil. Two inscriptions, higher up on\r\nthe monument, one in English and one in Italian, contain the dedication.\r\nThe column is also of Baveno granite, while the figure of the Genius of\r\nGeography and the statue proper of Columbus are of white Carrara marble,\r\nthe former being ten feet high and the latter fourteen. There is also a\r\nbronze eagle, six feet high, on the side opposite the figure of Genius\r\nof Geography, holding in its claws the shields of the United States and\r\nof Genoa. The rostra and the inscription on the column are in bronze.\r\n\r\nThis great work was designed by Prof. Gaetano Russo, who was born in\r\nMessina, Sicily, fifty-seven years ago. Craving opportunities for study\r\nand improvement, he made his way to Rome when a mere lad but ten years\r\nold. In this great art center his genius developed early, and his later\r\nyears have been filled with success. Senator Monteverde of Italy, one of\r\nthe best sculptors of modern times, says that this is one of the finest\r\nmonuments made during the last twenty-five years. On accepting the\r\nfinished monument from the artist, the commission tendered him the\r\nfollowing: \"The monument of Columbus made by you will keep great in\r\nAmerica the name of Italian art. It is very pleasant to convey to the\r\nUnited States--a strong, free, and independent people--the venerated\r\nresemblance of the man who made the civilization of America possible.\"\r\n\r\nOn the sides of the base, between the massive posts which form the\r\ncorners, are found the inscriptions in Italian and English, composed by\r\nProf. Ugo Fleres of Rome, and being as follows:\r\n\r\n  TO\r\n  CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS,\r\n  THE ITALIANS RESIDENT IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n  SCOFFED AT BEFORE;\r\n  DURING THE VOYAGE, MENACED;\r\n  AFTER IT, CHAINED;\r\n  AS GENEROUS AS OPPRESSED,\r\n  TO THE WORLD HE GAVE A WORLD.\r\n\r\n  JOY AND GLORY\r\n  NEVER UTTERED A MORE THRILLING CALL\r\n  THAN THAT WHICH RESOUNDED\r\n  FROM THE CONQUERED OCEAN\r\n  IN SIGHT OF THE FIRST AMERICAN ISLAND,\r\n  LAND! LAND!\r\n\r\n  ON THE XII. OF OCTOBER, MDCCCXCII\r\n  THE FOURTH CENTENARY\r\n  OF THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA,\r\n  IN IMPERISHABLE REMEMBRANCE.\r\n\r\nNear the base of the monument, on the front of the pedestal, is a\r\nrepresentation of the Genius of Geography in white Carrara marble. It is\r\na little over eleven feet high, and is represented as a winged angel\r\nbending over the globe, which it is intently studying while held beneath\r\nthe open hand.\r\n\r\nOn the front and back of the base the corresponding spaces are filled\r\nwith two magnificent allegorical pictures in bas-relief representing the\r\ndeparture from Spain and the landing in America of Columbus. The latter\r\none is particularly impressive, and the story is most graphically told\r\nby the strongly drawn group, of which he is the principal figure,\r\nstanding in at attitude of prayer upon the soil of the New World he has\r\njust discovered. To the left are his sailors drawing the keel of a boat\r\nupon the sand, and on the right the Indians peep cautiously out from a\r\nthicket of maize at the strange creatures whom they mistake for the\r\nmessengers of the Great Spirit. Towering over all, at the apex of the\r\ncolumn, stands the figure of the First Admiral himself, nobly portrayed\r\nin snowiest marble. The figure is fourteen feet in height and represents\r\nthe bold navigator wearing the dress of the period, the richly\r\nembroidered doublet, or waistcoat, thrown back, revealing a kilt that\r\nfalls in easy folds from a bodice drawn tightly over the broad chest\r\nbeneath. Not only the attitude of the figure but the expression of the\r\nface is commanding, and as you look upon the clearly cut features you\r\nseem to feel instinctively the presence of the man of genius and power,\r\nwhich the artist has forcibly chiseled.\r\n\r\nThe Italian government decided to send the monument here in the royal\r\ntransport Garigliano. Also, as a token of their good-will to the United\r\nStates, they ordered their first-class cruiser, Giovanni Bausan, to be\r\nin New York in time to take part in the ceremonies attending the\r\nunveiling and also the ceremonies by the city and State of New York.\r\n\r\nAll the work on the foundation was directed gratuitously by the\r\narchitect V. Del Genoese and Italian laborers. The materials were\r\nfurnished free by Messrs. Crimmins, Navarro, Smith & Sons, and others.\r\n\r\nThe executive committee in New York was composed of Chevalier C.\r\nBarsotti, president; C. A. Barattoni and E. Spinetti, vice-presidents;\r\nG. Starace, treasurer; E. Tealdi and G. N. Malferrari, secretaries; of\r\nthe presidents of the Italian societies of New York, Brooklyn, Jersey\r\nCity, and Hoboken; and of sixty-five members chosen from the subscribers\r\nas trustees.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMBUS MEMORIAL ARCH IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nRichard M. Hunt, John Lafarge, Augustus St. Gaudens, L. P. di Cesnola,\r\nand Robert J. Hoguet of the Sub-Committee on Art of the New York\r\nColumbian Celebration, awarded on September 1, 1892, the prizes offered\r\nfor designs for an arch to be erected at the entrance to Central Park at\r\nFifty-ninth Street and Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe committee chose, from the numerous designs submitted, four which\r\nwere of special excellence. That which was unanimously acknowledged to\r\nbe the best was submitted with the identification mark, \"Columbia,\" and\r\nproved to be the work of Henry B. Hertz of 22 West Forty-third Street.\r\nMr. Hertz will receive a gold medal, and the arch which he has designed\r\nwill be erected in temporary form for the Columbian celebration in\r\nOctober, 1892, and will be constructed as a permanent monument of marble\r\nand bronze to the Genius of Discovery if $350,000 can be secured to\r\nbuild it. The temporary structure is estimated to cost $7,500.\r\n\r\nThe design which the committee decided should receive the second prize\r\nwas offered by Franklin Crosby Butler and Paul Emil Dubois of 80\r\nWashington Square, East, and was entitled, \"The Santa Maria.\" A silver\r\nmedal will be given to the architects. The designs selected for\r\nhonorable mention were one of Moorish character, submitted by Albert\r\nWahle of 320 East Nineteenth Street, and one entitled \"Liberty,\" by J.\r\nC. Beeckman of 160 Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nMr. Hertz' design was selected by the committee not alone for its\r\nartistic beauty, but because of its peculiar fitness. The main body of\r\nthe arch is to be built of white marble, and with its fountains, its\r\npolished monolithic columns of pigeon-blood marble, its mosaic and gold\r\ninlaying, and the bas-relief work and surmounting group of bronze, the\r\ncommittee say it will be a monument to American architecture of which\r\nthe city will be proud.\r\n\r\nFrom the ground to the top of the bronze caravel in the center of the\r\nallegorical group with which the arch will be surmounted the distance\r\nwill be 160 feet, and the entire width of the arch will be 120 feet. The\r\nopening from the ground to the keystone will be eighty feet high and\r\nforty feet wide. On the front of each pier will be two columns of\r\npigeon-blood-red marble. Between each pair of columns and at the base of\r\neach pier will be large marble fountains, the water playing about\r\nfigures representing Victory and Immortality. These fountains will be\r\nlighted at night with electric lights. The surface of the piers between\r\nthe columns will be richly decorated in bas-relief with gold and mosaic.\r\nAbove each fountain will be a panel, one representing Columbus at the\r\ncourt of Spain, and the other the great discoverer at the Convent of\r\nRábida, just before his departure on the voyage which resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of America. In the spaces on either side of the crown of the\r\narch will be colossal reclining figures of Victory in bas-relief.\r\n\r\nThe highly decorated frieze will be of polished red marble, and\r\nsurmounting the projecting keystone of the arch will be a bronze\r\nrepresentation of an American eagle. On the central panel of the attic\r\nwill be the inscription: \"The United States of America, in Memorial\r\nGlorious to Christopher Columbus, Discoverer of America.\" The\r\nornamentation of the attic consists of representations of Columbus'\r\nentrance into Madrid. Crowning all is to be a group in bronze symbolical\r\nof Discovery. In this group there will be twelve figures of heroic size,\r\nwith a gigantic figure representing the Genius of Discovery heralding to\r\nthe world the achievements of her children.\r\n\r\nMr. Hertz, the designer, is only twenty-one years old, and is a student\r\nin the department of architecture of Columbia College.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH FOUNTAIN IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish-American citizens also wish to present a monument to the\r\ncity in honor of the discovery. It is proposed to have a Columbus\r\nfountain, to be located on the Grand Central Park plaza, at Fifth Avenue\r\nand Fifty-ninth Street, in the near future. The statuary group of the\r\nfountain represents Columbus standing on an immense globe, and on either\r\nside of him is one of the Pinzon brothers, who commanded the Pinta and\r\nNiña. Land has been discovered, and on the face of Columbus is an\r\nexpression of prayerful thanksgiving. The brother Pinzon who discovered\r\nthe land is pointing to it, while the other, with hand shading his eyes,\r\nanxiously seeks some sign of the new continent.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to cast the statuary group in New York of cannon donated\r\nby Spain and Spanish-American countries. The first of the cannon has\r\nalready arrived, the gift of the republic of Spanish Honduras.\r\n\r\nThe proposed inscription reads:\r\n\r\n  _A\r\n  COLON\r\n  y Los\r\n  PINZONES\r\n  Los Españoles\r\n  E Hispaño-Americanos\r\n  De\r\n  Nueva York._\r\n\r\n  To COLUMBUS and the PINZONS, the Spaniards\r\n  and Spanish-Americans of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nFESTIVAL ALLEGORY FOR THE NEW YORK CELEBRATION OF THE 400TH ANNIVERSARY\r\nOF COLUMBUS' DISCOVERY, 1892.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the New York celebration of the Columbus\r\nQuadro-Centennial is to be the production, October 10th, in the\r\nMetropolitan Opera House, of \"The Triumph of Columbus,\" a festival\r\nallegory, by S. G. Pratt.\r\n\r\nThe work is written for orchestra, chorus, and solo voices, and is in\r\nsix scenes or parts, the first of which is described as being \"in the\r\nnature of a prologue, wherein a dream of Columbus is pictured. Evil\r\nspirits and sirens hover about the sleeping mariner threatening and\r\ntaunting him. The Spirit of Light appears, the tormentors vanish, and a\r\nchorus of angels join the Spirit of Light in a song of 'Hope and\r\nFaith.'\"\r\n\r\nPart II. shows \"the historical council at Salamanca; Dominican monks\r\nsupport Columbus, but Cardinal Talavera and other priests ridicule him.\"\r\nColumbus, to disprove their accusations of heresy on his part, quotes\r\n\"sentence after sentence of the Bible in defense of his theory.\"\r\n\r\nPart III. represents Columbus and his boy Diego in poverty before the\r\nConvent La Rábida. They pray for aid, and are succored by Father Juan\r\nPerez and his monks.\r\n\r\nPart IV. contains a Spanish dance by the courtiers and ladies of Queen\r\nIsabella's court; a song by the Queen, wherein she tells of her\r\nadmiration for Columbus; the appearance of Father Juan, who pleads for\r\nthe navigator and his cause; the discouraging arguments of Talavera; the\r\nhesitation of the Queen; her final decision to help Columbus in his\r\nundertaking, and her prayer for the success of the voyage.\r\n\r\nPart V. is devoted to the voyage. Mr. Pratt has here endeavored to\r\npicture in a symphonic prelude \"the peaceful progress upon the waters,\r\nthe jubilant feeling of Columbus, and a flight of birds\"--subjects\r\ndissimilar enough certainly to lend variety to any orchestral\r\ncomposition. The part, in addition to this prelude, contains the\r\nrecitation by a sailor of \"The Legend of St. Brandon's Isle\"; a song by\r\nColumbus; the mutiny of the sailors, and Columbus' vain attempts to\r\nquell it; his appeal to Christ and the holy cross for aid, following\r\nwhich \"the miraculous appearance takes place and the sailors are awed\r\ninto submission\"; the chanting of evening vespers; the firing of the\r\nsignal gun which announces the discovery of land, and the singing of a\r\n_Gloria in Excelsis_ by Columbus, the sailors, and a chorus of angels.\r\n\r\nPart VI. is the \"grand pageantry of Columbus' reception at Barcelona. A\r\ntriumphal march by chorus, band, and orchestra forms an accompaniment to\r\na procession and the final reception.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGE AND COLOSSAL MAN.\r\n\r\n     From an introduction to \"The Story of Columbus,\" in the New York\r\n     _Herald_, 1892.\r\n\r\nWhat manner of man was this Columbus, this admiral of the seas and lord\r\nof the Indies, who gave to Castille and Leon a new world?\r\n\r\nWas he the ill-tempered and crack-brained adventurer of the skeptic\r\nbiographer, who weighed all men by the sum of ages and not by the age in\r\nwhich they lived, or the religious hero who carried a flaming cross into\r\nthe darkness of the unknown West, as his reverential historians have\r\npainted him?\r\n\r\nThere have been over six hundred biographers of this strange and\r\ncolossal man, advancing all degrees of criticism, from filial affection\r\nto religious and fanatical hate, yet those who dwell in the lands he\r\ndiscovered know him only by his achievements, caring nothing about the\r\ntrivial weaknesses of his private life.\r\n\r\nOne of his fairest critics has said he was the conspicuous developer of\r\na great world movement, the embodiment of the ripened aspirations of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHis life is enveloped in an almost impenetrable veil of obscurity; in\r\nfact, the date and the place of his birth are in dispute. There are no\r\nauthentic portraits of him, though hundreds have been printed.\r\n\r\nThere are in existence many documents written by Columbus about his\r\ndiscoveries. When he set sail on his first voyage he endeavored to keep\r\na log similar to the commentaries of Cæsar. It is from this log that\r\nmuch of our present knowledge has been obtained, but it is a lamentable\r\nfact that, while Columbus was an extraordinary executive officer, his\r\nadministrative ability was particularly poor, and in all matters of\r\ndetail he was so careless as to be untrustworthy. Therefore, there are\r\nmany statements in the log open to violent controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALES OF THE EAST.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the letters of Toscanelli made a greater impression\r\non the mind of Columbus than any other information he possessed. The\r\naged Florentine entertained the brightest vision of the marvelous worth\r\nof the Asiatic region. He spoke of two hundred towns whose bridges\r\nspanned a single river, and whose commerce would excite the cupidity of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThese were tales to stir circles of listeners wherever wandering mongers\r\nof caravels came and went. All sorts of visionary discoveries were made\r\nin those days. Islands were placed in the Atlantic that never existed,\r\nand wonderful tales were told of the great Island of Antilla, or the\r\nSeven Cities.\r\n\r\nThe sphericity of the earth was becoming a favorite belief, though it\r\nmust be borne in mind that education in those days was confined to the\r\ncloister, and any departure from old founded tenets was regarded as\r\nheresy. It was this peculiar doctrine that caused Columbus much\r\nembarrassment in subsequent years. His greatest enemies were the narrow\r\nminds that regarded religion as the _Ultima Thule_ of intellectual\r\nendeavor. In spite of these facts, however, it was becoming more and\r\nmore the popular belief that the world was not flat. One of the\r\narguments used against Columbus was, that if the earth was not flat, and\r\nwas round, he might sail down to the Indies, but he could certainly not\r\nsail up. Thus it was that fallacy after fallacy was thrown in\r\nargumentative form in his way, and the character of the man grows more\r\nwonderful as we see the obstacles over which he fought.\r\n\r\nFrom utter obscurity, from poverty, derision, and treachery, this\r\nunflinching spirit fought his way to a most courageous end, and in all\r\nthe vicissitudes of his wonderful life he never compromised one iota of\r\nthat dignity which he regarded as consonant with his lofty\r\naspirations.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROTEST AGAINST IGNORANCE.\r\n\r\n     New York _Tribune_, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of Columbus was a protest against the ignorance of the\r\nmediæval age. The discovery of the New World was the first sign of the\r\nreal renaissance of the Old World. It created new heavens and a new\r\nearth, broadened immeasurably the horizon of men and nations, and\r\ntransformed the whole order of European thought. Columbus was the\r\ngreatest educator who ever lived, for he emancipated mankind from the\r\nnarrowness of its own ignorance, and taught the great lesson that human\r\ndestiny, like divine mercy, arches over the whole world. If a\r\nperspective of four centuries of progress could have floated like a\r\nmirage before the eyes of the great discoverer as he was sighting San\r\nSalvador, the American school-house would have loomed up as the greatest\r\ninstitution of the New World's future. Behind him he had left mediæval\r\nignorance, encumbered with superstition, and paralyzed by an\r\necclesiastical pedantry which passed for learning. Before him lay a new\r\nworld with the promise of the potency of civil and religious liberty,\r\nfree education, and popular enlightenment. Because the school-house,\r\nlike his own voyage, has been a protest against popular ignorance, and\r\nhas done more than anything else to make our free America what it is, it\r\nwould have towered above everything else in the mirage-like vision of\r\nthe world's progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH'S ROTUNDITY.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. Father NUGENT of Iowa. From an address printed in the\r\n     Denver _Republican_, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the rotundity of the earth was not born with Columbus. It\r\nhad been announced centuries before Christ, but the law of gravitation\r\nhad not been discovered and the world found it impossible to think of\r\nanother hemisphere in which trees would grow downward into the air and\r\nmen walk with their heads suspended from their feet. The theologians and\r\nscholars who scoffed at Columbus' theory had better grounds for opposing\r\nhim, according to the received knowledge of the time, than he for\r\nupholding his ideal. They were scientifically wrong and he was\r\nunscientifically correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDS ACROSS THE SEA.\r\n\r\n     The President responds to a message from the Alcalde of Palos.\r\n\r\nThe following cable messages were exchanged this day:\r\n\r\nLA RÁBIDA, August 3d. The President: To-day, 400 years ago, Columbus\r\nsailed from Palos, discovering America. The United States flag is being\r\nhoisted this moment in front of the Convent La Rábida, along with\r\nbanners of all the American States. Batteries and ships saluting,\r\naccompanied by enthusiastic acclamations of the people, army, and navy.\r\nGod bless America.\r\n\r\n  PRIETO,\r\n  _Alcalde of Palos_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 3, 1892. Señor Prieto,\r\nAlcalde de Palos, La Rábida, Spain: The President of the United States\r\ndirects me to cordially acknowledge your message of greeting. On this\r\nmemorable day, thus fittingly celebrated, the people of the new western\r\nworld, in grateful reverence to the name and fame of Columbus, join\r\nhands with the sons of the brave sailors of Palos and Huelva who manned\r\nthe discoverer's caravels.\r\n\r\n  FOSTER,\r\n  _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAN-AMERICAN TRIBUTE.\r\n\r\n     The nations of North, South, and Central America in conference\r\n     assembled, at Washington, D. C., from October 2, 1889, to April 19,\r\n     1890.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in homage to the memory of the immortal discoverer of\r\nAmerica, and in gratitude for the unparalleled service rendered by him\r\nto civilization and humanity, the International Conference hereby offers\r\nits hearty co-operation in the manifestations to be made in his honor\r\non the occasion of the fourth centennial anniversary of the discovery of\r\nAmerica.[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIFT OF SPAIN.\r\n\r\n     THEODORE PARKER, a distinguished American clergyman and scholar.\r\n     Born at Lexington, Mass., August 24, 1810; died in Florence, Italy,\r\n     May 10, 1860. From \"New Assault upon Freedom in America.\"\r\n\r\nTo Columbus, adventurous Italy's most venturous son, Spain gave,\r\ngrudgingly, three miserable ships, wherewith that daring genius sailed\r\nthrough the classic and mediæval darkness which covered the great\r\nAtlantic deep, opening to mankind a new world, and new destination\r\ntherein. No queen ever wore a diadem so precious as those pearls which\r\nIsabella dropped into the western sea, a bridal gift, whereby the Old\r\nWorld, well endowed with art and science, and the hoarded wealth of\r\nexperience, wed America, rich only in her gifts from Nature and her\r\nhopes in time. The most valuable contribution Spain has made to mankind\r\nis three scant ships furnished to the Genoese navigator, whom the\r\nworld's instinct pushed westward in quest of continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS THE BOLDEST NAVIGATOR.\r\n\r\n     Capt. WILLIAM H. PARKER, an American naval officer of the\r\n     nineteenth century. From \"Familiar Talks on Astronomy.\"[51]\r\n\r\nLet us turn our attention to Christopher Columbus, the boldest navigator\r\nof his day; indeed, according to my view, the boldest man of whom we\r\nhave any account in history. While all the other seamen of the known\r\nworld were creeping along the shore, he heroically sailed forth on the\r\nbroad ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAP OF COLUMBUS' PILOT, JUAN DE LA COSA.\r\n\r\nFrom the original in the Marine Museum, Madrid. (See page 228)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I look back upon my own voyages and recall the many anxious moments\r\nI have passed when looking for a port at night, and when I compare my\r\nown situation, supplied with accurate charts, perfect instruments, good\r\nsailing directions, everything, in short, that science can supply, and\r\nthen think of Columbus in his little bark, his only instruments an\r\nimperfect compass and a rude astrolabe, _sailing forth upon an unknown\r\nsea_, I must award to him the credit of being the boldest seaman that\r\never \"sailed the salt ocean.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nColumbus, then, had made three discoveries before he discovered\r\nland--the trade-winds, the Sargasso Sea, and the variation of the\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS THE PATRON SAINT OF REAL-ESTATE DEALERS.\r\n\r\nAt a banquet in Chicago of the real-estate brokers, a waggish orator\r\nremarked that Columbus, with his cry of \"Land! Land!\" was clearly the\r\npatron saint of American real-estate dealers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUTINY.\r\n\r\n     HORATIO J. PERRY, an American author. From \"Reminiscences.\"\r\n\r\nWhen those Spanish mutineers leaped upon their Admiral's deck and\r\nadvanced upon him sword in hand, every man of them was aware that\r\naccording to all ordinary rules the safety of his own head depended on\r\ntheir going clean through and finishing their work. No compromise that\r\nshould leave Columbus alive could possibly have suited them then.\r\nNevertheless, at the bottom of it all, the moving impulse of those men\r\nwas terror. They were banded for that work by a common fear and a\r\ncommon superstition, and it was only when they looked in the clear face\r\nof one wholly free from the influences which enslaved themselves, when\r\nthey felt in their marrow that supreme expression of Columbus at the\r\npoint of a miserable death--only then the revulsion of confidence in him\r\nsuddenly relieved their own terrors. It was instinctive. This man knows!\r\nHe does not deceive us! We fools are compromising the safety of all by\r\nquenching this light. He alone can get us through this business--that\r\nwas the human instinct which responded to the look and bearing of\r\nColumbus at the moment when he was wholly lost, and when his life's\r\nwork, his great voyage almost accomplished, was also to all appearance\r\nlost. The instinct was sure, the response was certain, from the instinct\r\nthat its motive was also there sure and certain; but no other man in\r\nthat age could have provoked it, no other but Columbus could be sure of\r\nwhat he was then doing.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers went back to their work, and the ships went on. For three\r\ndays previous, the Admiral, following some indications he had noted from\r\nthe flight of birds, had steered southwest. Through that night of the\r\n10th and through the day of the 11th he still kept that course; but just\r\nat evening of the 11th he ordered the helm again to be put due west. The\r\nsquadron had made eighty-two miles that day, and his practiced senses\r\nnow taught him that land was indeed near. Without any hesitation he\r\ncalled together his chief officers, and announced to them that the end\r\nof their voyage was at hand; and he ordered the ships to sail well\r\ntogether, and to keep a sharp lookout through the night, as he expected\r\nland before the morning. Also, they had strict orders to shorten sail at\r\nmidnight, and not to advance beyond half speed. Then he promised a\r\nvelvet doublet of his own as a present to the man who should first make\r\nout the land. These details are well known, and they are authentic; and\r\nit is true also that these dispositions of the Admiral spread life\r\nthroughout the squadron. Nobody slept that night. It was only\r\ntwenty-four hours since they were ready to throw him overboard; but they\r\nnow believed in him and bitterly accused one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRACK OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     From a paper in _New England Magazine_, 1892, taken originally from\r\n     a volume of \"Reminiscences\" left by HORATIO J. PERRY, who made a\r\n     voyage from Spain to New Orleans in 1847.\r\n\r\nA fortnight out at sea! We are upon the track of Christopher Columbus.\r\nOnly three centuries and a half ago the keels of his caravels plowed for\r\nthe first time these very waters, bearing the greatest heart and wisest\r\nhead of his time, and one of the grandest figures in all history.\r\n\r\nTo conceive Columbus at his true value requires some effort in our age,\r\nwhen the earth has been girdled and measured, when the sun has been\r\nweighed and the planets brought into the relation of neighbors over the\r\nway, into whose windows we are constantly peeping in spite of the social\r\ngulf which keeps us from visiting either Mars or Venus. It is not easy\r\nto put ourselves back into the fifteenth century and limit ourselves as\r\nthose men were limited.\r\n\r\nI found it an aid to my comprehension of Columbus, this chance which\r\nsent me sailing over the very route of his great voyage. It is not, even\r\nnow, a frequented route. The bold Spanish and Portuguese navigators of\r\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are no longer found upon it. The\r\ntrade of the Indies has passed into other hands, and this is not the\r\nroad from England to the West Indies or to America.\r\n\r\nThus you may still sail for weeks in these seas without ever meeting a\r\nship. Leaving Madeira or the Canaries, you may even reach those western\r\nlands he reached without having seen or felt any other sign or incident\r\nexcept precisely such as were noted by him.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH WAS COLUMBUS' FRIEND.\r\n\r\n     OSKAR FERDINAND PESCHEL, a noted German geographer. Born at\r\n     Dresden, March 17, 1826; died, August 31, 1875.\r\n\r\nDeath saved Columbus the infliction of a blow which he probably would\r\nhave felt more than Bobadilla's fetters. He was allowed to carry to the\r\ngrave the glorious illusion that Cuba was a province of the Chinese\r\nEmpire, that Hispaniola was the Island Zipangu, and that only a narrow\r\nstrip of land, instead of a hemisphere covered by water, intervened\r\nbetween the Caribbean Sea and the Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\nThe discoverer of America died without suspecting that he had found a\r\nnew continent. He regarded the distance between Spain and Jamaica as a\r\nthird part of the circumference of the globe, and announced, \"The earth\r\nis by no means as large as is popularly supposed.\"\r\n\r\nThe extension of the world by a new continent had no place in his\r\nconceptions, and the greatness of his achievement would have been\r\nlessened in his eyes if he had been permitted to discover a second vast\r\nocean beyond that which he had traversed, for he would have seen that he\r\nhad but half accomplished his object, the connection of Europe with the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETRARCH'S TRIBUTE.\r\n\r\n     FRANCESCO PETRARCH, Italian poet. Born at Arezzo, in Tuscany, July\r\n     20, 1304; died at Arquá, near Padua, July 19, 1374.\r\n\r\n  The daylight hastening with wingéd steps,\r\n  Perchance to gladden the expectant eyes\r\n  Of far-off nations in a world remote.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS A VOLUMINOUS WRITER.\r\n\r\n     BARNET PHILLIPS, in _Harper's Weekly_, June 25, 1892, on \"The\r\n     Columbus Festival at Genoa.\"[52]\r\n\r\nIt can not be questioned but that Christopher Columbus was a voluminous\r\nwriter. Mr. Justin Winsor, who has made careful researches, says that\r\n\"ninety-seven distinct pieces of writing by the hand of Columbus either\r\nexist or are known to have existed. Of such, whether memoirs, relations,\r\nor letters, sixty-four are preserved in their entirety.\" Columbus seems\r\nto have written all his letters in Spanish. Genoa is fortunate in\r\npossessing a number of authentic letters, and these are preserved in a\r\nmarble custodia, surmounted by a head of Columbus. In the pillar which\r\nforms the pedestal there is a bronze door, and the precious Columbus\r\ndocuments have been placed there. (See p. 54, _ante_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS LIFE WAS A PATH OF THORNS.\r\n\r\n     ROBERT POLLOK, a Scottish poet of some note. Born at Muirhouse,\r\n     Renfrewshire, 1798; died near Southampton, September, 1827.\r\n\r\n  Oh, who can tell what days, what nights, he spent,\r\n  Of tideless, waveless, sailless, shoreless woe!\r\n  And who can tell how many glorious once,\r\n  To him, of brilliant promise full--wasted,\r\n  And pined, and vanished from the earth!\r\n\r\n\r\nUNWEPT, UNHONORED, AND UNSUNG.\r\n\r\n     W. F. POOLE, LL. D., Librarian of the Newberry Library, Chicago.\r\n     From \"Christopher Columbus,\" in _The Dial_ for April, 1892.\r\n     Published by _The Dial_ Company, Chicago.\r\n\r\nIt had been well for the reputation of Columbus if he had died in 1493,\r\nwhen he returned from his first voyage. He had found a pathway to a land\r\nbeyond the western ocean; and although he had no conception of what he\r\nhad discovered, it was the most important event in the history of the\r\nfifteenth century. There was nothing left for him to do to increase his\r\nrenown. A coat-of-arms had been assigned him, and he rode on horseback\r\nthrough the streets of Barcelona, with the King on one side of him and\r\nPrince Juan on the other. His enormous claims for honors and emoluments\r\nhad been granted. His first letter of February, 1493, printed in several\r\nlanguages, had been read in the courts of Europe with wonder and\r\namazement. \"What delicious food for an ingenious mind!\" wrote Peter\r\nMartyr. In England, it was termed \"a thing more divine than human.\" No\r\nother man ever rose to such a pinnacle of fame so suddenly; and no other\r\nman from such a height ever dropped out of sight so quickly. His three\r\nlater voyages were miserable failures; a pitiful record of misfortunes,\r\nblunders, cruelties, moral delinquencies, quarrels, and impotent\r\ncomplainings. They added nothing to the fund of human knowledge, or to\r\nhis own. On the fourth voyage he was groping about to find the River\r\nGanges, the great Khan of China, and the earthly paradise. His two\r\nsubsequent years of disappointment and sickness and poverty were\r\nwretchedness personified. Other and more competent men took up the work\r\nof discovery, and in thirteen years after the finding of a western route\r\nto India had been announced, the name and personality of Columbus had\r\nalmost passed from the memory of men. He died at Valladolid, May 20,\r\n1506; and outside of a small circle of relatives, his body was committed\r\nto the earth with as little notice and ceremony as that of an unknown\r\nbeggar on its way to the potter's field. Yet the Spanish court was in\r\nthe town at the time. Peter Martyr was there, writing long letters of\r\nnews and gossip; and in five that are still extant there is no mention\r\nof the sickness and death of Columbus. Four weeks later an official\r\ndocument had the brief mention that \"the Admiral is dead.\" Two Italian\r\nauthors, making, one and two years later, some corrections pertaining\r\nto his early voyages, had not heard of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW STAMPS FOR WORLD'S FAIR YEAR.\r\n\r\n     From the New York _Commercial Advertiser_.\r\n\r\nThird Assistant Postmaster-General Hazen is preparing the designs for a\r\nset of \"Jubilee\" stamps, to be issued by the Postoffice Department in\r\nhonor of the quadri-centennial. That is, he is getting together material\r\nwhich will suggest to him the most appropriate subjects to be\r\nillustrated on these stamps. He has called on the Bureau of American\r\nRepublics for some of the Columbian pictures with which it is\r\noverflowing, and he recently took a big portfolio of them down into the\r\ncountry to examine at his leisure.\r\n\r\nOne of the scenes to be illustrated, undoubtedly, will be the landing of\r\nColumbus. The Convent of La Rábida, where Columbus is supposed to have\r\nbeen housed just before his departure from Spain on his voyage of\r\ndiscovery, will probably be the chief figure of another. The head of\r\nColumbus will decorate one of the stamps--probably the popular 2-cent\r\nstamp. Gen. Hazen resents the suggestion that the 5-cent, or foreign,\r\nstamp be made the most ornate in the collection. He thinks that the\r\nAmerican public is entitled to the exclusive enjoyment of the most\r\nbeautiful of the new stamps.\r\n\r\nBesides, the stamps will be of chief value to the Exposition, as they\r\nadvertise it among the people of America. The Jubilee stamps will be one\r\nof the best advertisements the World's Fair will have. It would not be\r\nunfair if the Postoffice Department should demand that the managers of\r\nthe World's Fair pay the additional expense of getting out the new\r\nissue. But the stamp collectors will save the department the necessity\r\nof doing that.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the issue of the current stamps will not be suspended\r\nwhen the Jubilee stamps come in; but it is altogether likely that the\r\nissue will be suspended for a year, and that at the end of that time the\r\ndies and plates for the Jubilee stamps will be destroyed and the old\r\ndies and plates will be brought out and delivered to the contractor\r\nagain. These dies and plates are always subject to the order of the\r\nPostmaster-general. He can call for them at any time, and the contractor\r\nmust deliver them into his charge.\r\n\r\nWhile they are in use they are under the constant supervision of a\r\ngovernment agent, and the contractor is held responsible for any plate\r\nthat might be made from his dies and for any stamps that might be\r\nprinted surreptitiously from such plates.\r\n\r\nAn oddity in the new series will be the absence of the faces of\r\nWashington and Franklin. The first stamps issued by the Postoffice\r\nDepartment were the 5 and 10 cent stamps of 1847. One of these bore the\r\nhead of Washington and the other that of Franklin. From that day to this\r\nthese heads have appeared on some two of the stamps of the United\r\nStates. In the Jubilee issue they will be missing, unless Mr. Wanamaker\r\nor Mr. Hazen changes the present plan. It is intended now that only one\r\nportrait shall appear on any of the stamps, and that one will be of\r\nColumbus.\r\n\r\nIt will take some time to prepare the designs for the new stamps, after\r\nthe selection of the subjects, but Gen. Hazen expects to have them on\r\nsale the 1st of January next. The subjects will be sent to the American\r\nBank Note Company, which will prepare the designs and submit them for\r\napproval. When they are approved, the dies will be prepared and proofs\r\nsent to the department. Five engravings were made before an acceptable\r\nportrait of Gen. Grant was obtained for use on the current 5-cent\r\nstamp. Gen. Grant, by the way, was the only living American whose\r\nportrait during his lifetime was under consideration in getting up stamp\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT, an eminent American historian. Born at\r\n     Salem, Mass., May 4, 1796; died January 28, 1859. From \"Ferdinand\r\n     and Isabella.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some men in whom rare virtues have been closely allied, if not\r\nto positive vice, to degrading weakness. Columbus' character presented\r\nno such humiliating incongruity. Whether we contemplate it in its public\r\nor private relations, in all its features it wears the same noble\r\naspect. It was in perfect harmony with the grandeur of his plans and\r\ntheir results, more stupendous than those which heaven has permitted any\r\nother mortal to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM PALOS TO BARCELONA--HIS TRIUMPH.\r\n\r\nThe bells sent forth a joyous peal in honor of his arrival; but the\r\nAdmiral was too desirous of presenting himself before the sovereigns to\r\nprotract his stay long at Palos. His progress through Seville was an\r\novation. It was the middle of April before Columbus reached Barcelona.\r\nThe nobility and cavaliers in attendance on the court, together with the\r\nauthorities of the city, came to the gates to receive him, and escorted\r\nhim to the royal presence. Ferdinand and Isabella were seated with their\r\nson, Prince John, under a superb canopy of state, awaiting his arrival.\r\nOn his approach they rose from their seats, and, extending their hands\r\nto him to salute, caused him to be seated before them. These were\r\nunprecedented marks of condescension to a person of Columbus' rank in\r\nthe haughty and ceremonious court of Castille. It was, indeed, the\r\nproudest moment in the life of Columbus. He had fully established the\r\ntruth of his long-contested theory, in the face of argument, sophistry,\r\nsneer, skepticism, and contempt. After a brief interval the sovereigns\r\nrequested from Columbus a recital of his adventures; and when he had\r\ndone so, the King and Queen, together with all present, prostrated\r\nthemselves on their knees in grateful thanksgivings, while the solemn\r\nstrains of the _Te Deum_ were poured forth by the choir of the royal\r\nchapel, as in commemoration of some glorious victory.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLAIM OF THE NORSEMEN.\r\n\r\n     From an editorial in _Public Opinion_, Washington.\r\n\r\nModern historians are pretty generally agreed that America was actually\r\nfirst made known to the Eastern world by the indefatigable Norsemen.\r\nYet, in spite of this fact, Columbus has been, and still continues to\r\nbe, revered as the one man to whose genius and courage the discovery of\r\nthe New World is due. Miss Brown, in her \"Icelandic Discoverers,\" justly\r\nsays it should be altogether foreign to American institutions and ideas\r\nof liberty and honor to countenance longer the worship of a false idol.\r\nThe author first proceeds to set forth the evidence upon which the\r\nclaims of the Norsemen rest. The author charges that the heads of the\r\nRoman Catholic church were early cognizant of this discovery of the\r\nNorsemen, but that they suppressed this information. The motives for\r\nthis concealment are charged to their well-known reluctance to allow any\r\ncredit to non-Catholic believers, under which head, at that time, the\r\nNorsemen were included. They preferred that the New World should first\r\nbe made known to Southern Europe by adherents to the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith. Most damaging evidence against Columbus' having originated,\r\nunaided, the idea of a western world or route to India is furnished by\r\nthe fact that he visited Iceland in person in the spring of 1477, when\r\nhe must have heard rumors of the early voyages. He is known to have\r\nvisited the harbor at Hvalfjord, on the south coast of Iceland, at a\r\ntime when that harbor was most frequented, and also at the same time\r\nwhen Bishop Magnus is known to have been there. They must have met, and,\r\nas they had means of communicating through the Latin language, would\r\nnaturally have spoken of these distant countries. We have no hint of the\r\nobject of this visit of Columbus, for he scrupulously avoids subsequent\r\nmention of it; but the author pleases to consider it as a secret\r\nmission, instigated by the Church for the purpose of obtaining all\r\navailable information concerning the Norse discoveries. Certain it is\r\nthat soon after his return to Spain we find him petitioning the King and\r\nQueen for a grant of ships and men to further the enterprise; and he was\r\nwilling to wait for more than fourteen years before he obtained them.\r\nHis extravagant demands of the King and Queen concerning the rights,\r\ntitles, and percentage of all derived from the countries \"he was about\r\nto discover,\" can hardly be viewed in any other light than that of\r\npositive knowledge concerning their existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPULCI'S PROPHECY.\r\n\r\n     LUIGI PULCI, an Italian poet. Born at Florence in 1431; died about\r\n     1487.\r\n\r\n  Men shall descry another hemisphere,\r\n  Since to one common center all things tend;\r\n  So earth, by curious mystery divine,\r\n  Well balanced hangs amid the starry spheres.\r\n  At our antipodes are cities, states,\r\n  And thronged empires ne'er divined of yore.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER, THE CHRIST-BEARER.\r\n\r\n     GEORGE PAYNE QUACKENBOS, an American teacher and educational\r\n     writer. Born in New York, 1826; died December 24, 1881.\r\n\r\nFull of religious enthusiasm, he regarded this voyage to the western\r\nseas as his peculiar mission, and himself--as his name, CHRISTOPHER,\r\nimports--the appointed _Christ-bearer_, or _gospel-bearer_, to the\r\nnatives of the new lands he felt that he was destined to discover.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEADING WITH KINGS FOR A NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. MYRON REED, a celebrated American clergyman of the present\r\n     day.\r\n\r\nHere is Columbus. Somehow I think he is more of a man while he is\r\nbegging for ships and a crew, when he is in mid-ocean sailing to\r\ndiscover America, than when he found it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST DAYS OF THE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\nThe last days of the voyage of Columbus were lonesome days. He had to\r\ndepend on his own vision. I do not know what he had been--probably a\r\nbuccaneer. We know that he was to be a trader in slaves. But in spite of\r\nwhat he had been and was to become, once he was great.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nROLL OF THE CREWS OF THE THREE CARAVELS.\r\n\r\nCREW OF THE SANTA MARIA.--_Admiral_, Cristoval Colon; _Master and\r\nowner_, Juan de la Cosa of Santoña; _Pilot_, Sancho Ruiz; _Boatswain_,\r\nMaestre Diego; _Surgeon_, Maestre Alonzo of Moguer; _Assistant Surgeon_,\r\nMaestre Juan; _Overseer_, Rodrigo Sanchez of Segovia; _Secretary_,\r\n*Rodrigo de Escobedo[53]; _Master at Arms_, *Diego de Arana of Cordova;\r\n_Volunteer_, *Pedro Gutierrez, (A gentleman of the King's bedchamber);\r\n_Volunteer_, *Bachiller Bernardo de Tapia of Ledesma; _Steward_, Pedro\r\nTerreros; _Admiral's Servant_, Diego de Salcedo; _Page_, Pedro de\r\nAcevedo; _Interpreter_, Luis de Torres, (A converted Jew); _Seamen_,\r\nRodrigo de Jerez, Garcia Ruiz of Santoña, Pedro de Villa of Santoña,\r\nRodrigo Escobar, Francisco of Huelva, Ruy Fernandez of Huelva, Pedro\r\nBilbao of Larrabezua, *Alonzo Velez of Seville, *Alonzo Perez Osorio;\r\n_Assayer and Silversmith_, *Castillo of Seville; _Seamen of the Santa\r\nMaria_, *Antonio of Jaen, *Alvaro Perez Osorio, *Cristoval de Alamo of\r\nNiebla, *Diego Garcia of Jerez, *Diego de Tordoya of Cabeza de Vaca,\r\n*Diego de Capilla of Almeden, *Diego of Mambles, *Diego de Mendoza,\r\n*Diego de Montalvan of Jaen, *Domingo de Bermeo, *Francisco de Godoy of\r\nSeville, *Francisco de Vergara of Seville, *Francisco of Aranda,\r\n*Francisco Henao of Avila, *Francisco Jimenes of Seville, *Gabriel\r\nBaraona of Belmonte, *Gonzalo Fernandez of Segovia, *Gonzalo Fernandez\r\nof Leon, *Guillermo Ires of Galway, *Jorge Gonzalez of Trigueros, *Juan\r\nde Cueva, *Juan Patiño of La Serena, *Juan del Barco of Avila, *Pedro\r\nCarbacho of Caceres, *Pedro of Talavera, *Sebastian of Majorca,\r\n*Tallarte de Lajes (Ingles).\r\n\r\nTHE CREW OF THE PINTA.--_Captain of the Pinta_, Martin Alonzo Pinzon;\r\n_Master_, Francisco Martin Pinzon; _Pilot of the vessel_, Cristoval\r\nGarcia Sarmiento; _Boatswain_, Bartolomè Garcia; _Surgeon_, Garci\r\nHernandez; _Purser_, Juan de Jerez; _Caulker_, Juan Perez; _Seamen_,\r\nRodrigo Bermudez de Triana of Alcala de la Guadaira, Juan Rodriguez\r\nBermejo of Molinos, Juan de Sevilla, Garcia Alonzo, Gomez Rascon\r\n(owner), Cristoval Quintero (owner), Diego Bermudez, Juan Bermudez,\r\nFrancisco Garcia Gallegos of Moguer, Francisco Garcia Vallejo, Pedro de\r\nArcos.\r\n\r\nCREW OF THE NIÑA.--_Captain of the Niña_, Vicente Yañez Pinzon; _Master\r\nand part owner of the vessel_, Juan Niño; _Pilots_, Pero Alonzo Niño,\r\nBartolomè Roldan; _Seamen_ _of the Niña_, Francisco Niño, Gutierrez\r\nPerez, Juan Ortiz, Alonso Gutierrez Querido, *Diego de Torpa[54],\r\n*Francisco Fernandez, *Hernando de Porcuna, *Juan de Urniga, *Juan\r\nMorcillo, *Juan del Villar, *Juan de Mendoza, *Martin de Logrosan,\r\n*Pedro de Foronda, *Tristan de San Jorge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS A THEORETICAL CIRCUMNAVIGATOR.\r\n\r\n     JOHN CLARK RIDPATH, LL. D., an American author and educator. Born\r\n     in Putnam County, Indiana, April 26, 1840. From \"History of United\r\n     States,\" 1874.\r\n\r\nSir John Mandeville had declared in the very first English book that\r\never was written (A. D. 1356) that the world is a sphere, and that it\r\nwas both possible and practicable for a man to sail around the world and\r\nreturn to the place of starting; but neither Sir John himself nor any\r\nother seaman of his times was bold enough to undertake so hazardous an\r\nenterprise. Columbus was, no doubt, the first _practical_ believer in\r\nthe theory of circumnavigation, and although he never sailed around the\r\nworld himself, he demonstrated the possibility of doing so.\r\n\r\nThe great mistake with Columbus and others who shared his opinions was\r\nnot concerning the figure of the earth, but in regard to its size. He\r\nbelieved the world to be no more than 10,000 or 12,000 miles in\r\ncircumference. He therefore confidently expected that after sailing\r\nabout 3,000 miles to the westward he should arrive at the East Indies,\r\nand to do that was the one great purpose of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPORTANT FIND OF MSS.\r\n\r\n     JUAN F. RIAÑO. \"Review of Continental Literature,\" July, 1891, to\r\n     July, 1892. From \"_The Athenæum_\" (England), July 2, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe excitement about Columbus has rather been heightened by the\r\naccidental discovery of three large holograph volumes, in quarto, of Fr.\r\nBartolomé de Las Casas, the Bishop of Chiapa, who, as is well known,\r\naccompanied the navigator in his fourth voyage to the West Indies. The\r\nvolumes were deposited by Las Casas in San Gregorio de Valladolid, where\r\nhe passed the last years of his life in retirement. There they remained\r\nuntil 1836, when, owing to the suppression of the monastic orders, the\r\nbooks of the convent were dispersed, and the volumes of the Apostle of\r\nthe Indies, as he is still called, fell into the hands of a collector of\r\nthe name of Acosta, from whom a grandson named Arcos inherited them.\r\nThough written in the bishop's own hand, they are not of great value, as\r\nthey only contain his well-known \"Historia Apologetica de las Indias,\"\r\nof which no fewer than three different copies, dating from the sixteenth\r\ncentury, are to be found here at Madrid, and the whole was published\r\nsome years ago in the \"Documentos Inéditos para la Historia de España.\"\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm for Columbus and his companions has not in the least\r\ndamped the ardor of my countrymen for every sort of information\r\nrespecting their former colonies, in America or their possessions in the\r\nIndian Archipelago and on the northern coast of Africa. Respecting the\r\nformer I may mention the second volume of the \"Historia del Nuevo\r\nMundo,\" by Cobo, 1645; the third and fourth volume of the \"Origen de los\r\nIndios del Peru, Mexico, Santa Féy Chile,\" by Diego Andrés Rocha; \"De\r\nlas Gentes del Peru,\" forming part of the \"Historia Apologetica,\" by\r\nBartolomé de las Casas, though not found in his three holograph volumes\r\nrecently discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILDREN OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM ROBERTSON (usually styled Principal ROBERTSON), a\r\n     celebrated Scottish historian. Born at Bosthwick, Mid-Lothian,\r\n     September 19, 1721; died June, 1793.\r\n\r\nColumbus was the first European who set foot in the New World which he\r\nhad discovered. He landed in a rich dress, and with a naked sword in his\r\nhand. His men followed, and, kneeling down, they all kissed the ground\r\nwhich they had long desired to see. They next erected a crucifix, and\r\nprostrating themselves before it returned thanks to God for conducting\r\ntheir voyage to such a happy issue.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards while thus employed were surrounded by many of the\r\nnatives, who gazed in silent admiration upon actions which they could\r\nnot comprehend, and of which they could not foresee the consequences.\r\nThe dress of the Spaniards, the whiteness of their skins, their beards,\r\ntheir arms, appeared strange and surprising. The vast machines in which\r\nthe Spaniards had traversed the ocean, that seemed to move upon the\r\nwater with wings, and uttered a dreadful sound, resembling thunder,\r\naccompanied with lightning and smoke, struck the natives with such\r\nterror that they began to respect their new guests as a superior order\r\nof beings, and concluded that they were children of the sun, who had\r\ndescended to visit the earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo all the kingdoms of Europe, Christopher Columbus, by an effort of\r\ngenius and of intrepidity the boldest and most successful that is\r\nrecorded in the annals of mankind, added a new world.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRONZE DOOR AT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThis is the main central door of the Capitol at Washington, D. C., and\r\non it is a pictured history of events connected with the life of\r\nColumbus and the discovery of America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLUMBUS MONUMENT, Paseo de la Reforma, City of\r\nMexico. Sculptor, M, Cordier.]\r\n\r\nThe door weighs 20,000 pounds; is seventeen feet high and nine feet\r\nwide; it is folding or double, and stands sunk back inside of a bronze\r\ncasing, which projects about a foot forward from the leaves or valves.\r\nOn this casing are four figures at the top and bottom, representing\r\nAsia, Africa, Europe, and America. A border, emblematic of conquest and\r\nnavigation, runs along the casing between them.\r\n\r\nThe door has eight panels besides the semicircular one at the top. In\r\neach panel is a picture in _alto-relievo_.\r\n\r\nIt was designed by Randolph Rogers, an American, and modeled by him in\r\nRome, in 1858; and was cast by F. Von Muller, at Munich, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe story the door tells is the history of Columbus and the discovery of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe panel containing the earliest event in the life of the discoverer is\r\nthe lowest one on the south side, and represents \"Columbus undergoing an\r\nexamination before the Council of Salamanca.\"\r\n\r\nThe panel above it contains \"Columbus' departure from the Convent of\r\nSanta Maria de la Rábida,\" near Palos. He is just setting out to visit\r\nthe Spanish court.\r\n\r\nThe one above it is his \"audience at the court of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella.\"\r\n\r\nThe next panel is the top one of this half of the door, and represents\r\nthe \"starting of Columbus from Palos on his first voyage.\"\r\n\r\nThe transom panel occupies the semicircular sweep over the whole door.\r\nThe extended picture here is the \"first landing of the Spaniards at San\r\nSalvador.\"\r\n\r\nThe top panel on the other leaf of the door represents the \"first\r\nencounter of the discoverers with the natives.\" In it one of the sailors\r\nis seen bringing an Indian girl on his shoulders a prisoner. The\r\ntransaction aroused the stern indignation of Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe panel next below this one has in it \"the triumphal entry of Columbus\r\ninto Barcelona.\"\r\n\r\nThe panel below this represents a very different scene, and is \"Columbus\r\nin chains.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next and last panel is the \"death scene.\" Columbus lies in bed;\r\nthe last rites of the Catholic church have been administered; friends\r\nand attendants are around him; and a priest holds up a crucifix for him\r\nto kiss, and upon it bids him fix his dying eyes.\r\n\r\nOn the door, on the sides and between the panels, are sixteen small\r\nstatues, set in niches, of eminent contemporaries of Columbus. Their\r\nnames are marked on the door, and beginning at the bottom, on the side\r\nfrom which we started in numbering the panels, we find the figure in the\r\nlowest niche is Juan Perez de la Marchena, prior of La Rábida; then\r\nabove him is Hernando Cortez; and again, standing over him, is Alonzo de\r\nOjeda.\r\n\r\nAmerigo Vespucci occupies the next niche on the door.\r\n\r\nThen, opposite in line, across the door, standing in two niches, side by\r\nside, are Cardinal Mendoza and Pope Alexander VI.\r\n\r\nThen below them stand Ferdinand and Isabella, King and Queen of Spain;\r\nbeneath them stands the Lady Beatrice Enriquez de Bobadilla; beside her\r\nis Charles VIII., King of France.\r\n\r\nThe first figure of the lowest pair on the door is Henry VII. of\r\nEngland; beside him stands John II., King of Portugal.\r\n\r\nThen, in the same line with them, across the panel, is Alonzo Pinzon.\r\n\r\nIn the niche above Alonzo Pinzon stands Bartolomeo Columbus, the brother\r\nof the great navigator.\r\n\r\nThen comes Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, and in the niche above, again at the\r\ntop of the door, stands the figure of Francisco Pizarro, the conqueror\r\nof Peru.\r\n\r\nBetween the panels and at top and bottom of the valves of the door are\r\nten projecting heads. Those between the panels are historians who have\r\nwritten Columbus' voyages from his own time down to the present day,\r\nending with Washington Irving and William Hickling Prescott.\r\n\r\nThe two heads at the tops of the valves are female heads, while the two\r\nnext the floor possess Indian characteristics.\r\n\r\nAbove, over the transom arch, looks down, over all, the serene grand\r\nhead of Columbus. Beneath it, the American eagle spreads out his widely\r\nextended wings.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers[55] received $8,000 for his models, and Mr. Von Muller was\r\npaid $17,000 in gold for casting the door. To a large portion of this\r\nlatter sum must be added the high premium on exchange which ruled during\r\nthe war, the cost of storage and transportation, and the expense of the\r\nerection of the door in the Capitol after its arrival. These items\r\nwould, added together, far exceed $30,000 in the then national currency.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTA MARIA RÁBIDA, THE CONVENT--RÁBIDA.\r\n\r\n     SAMUEL ROGERS, the English banker-poet. Born near London, July 30,\r\n     1763; died December, 1855. Translated from a Castilian MS., and\r\n     printed as an introduction to his poem, \"The Voyage of Columbus.\"\r\n     It is stated that he spent $50,000 in the illustrations of this\r\n     volume of his poems.\r\n\r\n      In Rábida's monastic fane\r\n      I can not ask, and ask in vain;\r\n      The language of Castille I speak,\r\n      'Mid many an Arab, many a Greek,\r\n      Old in the days of Charlemagne,\r\n      When minstrel-music wandered round,\r\n      And science, waking, blessed the sound.\r\n\r\n      No earthly thought has here a place,\r\n      The cowl let down on every face;\r\n      Yet here, in consecrated dust,\r\n      Here would I sleep, if sleep I must.\r\n      From Genoa, when Columbus came\r\n      (At once her glory and her shame),\r\n      'T was here he caught the holy flame;\r\n      'T was here the generous vow he made;\r\n      His banners on the altar laid.\r\n\r\n      Here, tempest-worn and desolate,\r\n        A pilot journeying through the wild\r\n      Stopped to solicit at the gate\r\n        A pittance for his child.\r\n\r\n      'T was here, unknowing and unknown,\r\n      He stood upon the threshold stone.\r\n      But hope was his, a faith sublime,\r\n      That triumphs over place and time;\r\n      And here, his mighty labor done,\r\n      And here, his course of glory run,\r\n      Awhile as more than man he stood,\r\n      So large the debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Who the great secret of the deep possessed,\r\n  And, issuing through the portals of the West,\r\n  Fearless, resolved, with every sail unfurled,\r\n  Planted his standard on the unknown world.\r\n\r\n                                     --_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nGENOA.\r\n\r\n  Thy brave mariners,\r\n  They had fought so often by thy side,\r\n  Staining the mountain billows.\r\n\r\n  --_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNCHED OUT INTO THE DEEP.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM RUSSELL, American author and educationist. Born in\r\n     Scotland, 1798; died, 1873. From his \"Modern History.\"\r\n\r\nTranscendent genius and superlative courage experience almost equal\r\ndifficulty in carrying their designs into execution when they depend on\r\nthe assistance of others. Columbus possessed both--he exerted both; and\r\nthe concurrence of other heads and other hearts was necessary to give\r\nsuccess to either; he had indolence and cowardice to encounter, as well\r\nas ignorance and prejudice. He had formerly been ridiculed as a\r\nvisionary, he was now pitied as a desperado. The Portuguese navigators,\r\nin accomplishing their first discoveries, had always some reference to\r\nthe coast; cape had pointed them to cape; but Columbus, with no landmark\r\nbut the heavens, nor any guide but the compass, boldly launched into the\r\nocean, without knowing what shore should receive him or where he could\r\nfind rest for the sole of his foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUARY AT SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal features in the State capitol at Sacramento is a\r\nbeautiful and artistic group of statuary, cut from a solid block of\r\npurest white marble. It represents Columbus pleading the cause of his\r\nproject before Queen Isabella of Spain. The Spanish sovereign is seated;\r\nat her left hand kneels the First Admiral, while an attendant page on\r\nthe right watches with wonder the nobly generous action of the Queen.\r\nColumbus, with a globe in his hand, contends that the world is round,\r\nand pleads for assistance to fit out an expedition to discover the New\r\nWorld. The royal reply is, \"I will assume the undertaking for my own\r\ncrown of Castille, and am ready to pledge my jewels to defray its\r\nexpense, if the funds in the treasury shall be found inadequate,\" The\r\ngroup, which is said to be a masterpiece of work, the only piece of its\r\nkind in the United States, was executed in Florence, Italy, by Larkin G.\r\nMead of Vermont, an American artist of known reputation. Costing\r\n$60,000, it was presented to the State of California, in 1883, by Mr. D.\r\nO. Mills.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MONUMENT NEAR SALAMANCA.\r\n\r\nAt Valcuebo, a country farm once belonging to the Dominicans of\r\nSalamanca, Columbus was entertained by Diego de Deza--prior of the great\r\nDominican convent of San Esteban and professor of theology at\r\nSalamanca--while the Junta [committee] of Spanish ecclesiastics\r\nconsidered his prospects. His residence there was a peaceful oasis in\r\nthe stormy life of the great discoverer. The little grange still stands\r\nat a distance of about three miles west of Salamanca, and the country\r\npeople have a tradition that on the crest of a small hill near the\r\nhouse, now called \"Teso de Colon\" (i. e., Columbus' Peak), the future\r\ndiscoverer used to pass long hours conferring with his visitors or\r\nreading in solitude. The present owner, Don Martin de Solis, has erected\r\na monument on this hill, consisting of a stone pyramid surmounted by a\r\nglobe; it commemorates the spot where the storm-tossed hero enjoyed a\r\nbrief interval of peace and rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONOR TO WHOM HONOR IS DUE.\r\n\r\n     MANOEL FRANCISCO DE BARROS Y SOUZA, VISCOUNT SANTAREM, a noted\r\n     Portuguese diplomatist and writer. Born at Lisbon, 1790; died,\r\n     1856.\r\n\r\nIf Columbus was not the first to discover America, he was, at least, the\r\nman who _re_discovered it, and in a positive and definite shape\r\ncommunicated the knowledge of it. For, if he verified what the Egyptian\r\npriest indicated to Solon, the Athenian, as is related by Plato in the\r\nTimoeus respecting the Island of Atlantis; if he realized the\r\nhypothesis of Actian; if he accomplished the prophecy of Seneca in the\r\nMedea; if he demonstrated that the story of the mysterious Carthaginian\r\nvessel, related by Aristotle and Theophrastus, was not a dream; if he\r\nestablished by deeds that there was nothing visionary in what St.\r\nGregory pointed at in one of his letters to St. Clement; if, in a word,\r\nColumbus proved by his discovery the existence of the land which Madoc\r\nhad visited before him, as Hakluyt and Powell pretended; and ascertained\r\nfor a certainty that which for the ancients had always been so\r\nuncertain, problematical, and mysterious--his glory becomes only the\r\nmore splendid, and more an object to command admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SANTIAGO BUST.\r\n\r\nAt Santiago, Chili, a marble bust of Columbus is to be found, with a\r\nface modeled after the De Bry portrait, an illustration of which latter\r\nappears in these pages. The bust has a Dutch cap and garments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. LOUIS STATUE.\r\n\r\nIn the city of St. Louis, Mo., a statue of Columbus has been erected as\r\nthe gift of Mr. Henry D. Shaw. It consists of a heroic-sized figure of\r\nColumbus in gilt bronze, upon a granite pedestal, which has four bronze\r\n_basso relievos_ of the principal events in his career. The face of the\r\nstatue follows the Genoa model, and the statue was cast at Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN AMERICA'S TRIBUTE.\r\n\r\nAt Lima, Peru, a fine group of statuary was erected in 1850,\r\nrepresenting Columbus in the act of raising an Indian girl from the\r\nground. Upon the front of the marble pedestal is the simple dedication:\r\n\"Á Cristoval Colon\" (To Christopher Columbus), and upon the other three\r\nfaces are appropriate nautical designs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATUE IN BOSTON.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Iasigi statue, Boston boasts of one of the most\r\nartistic statues to Columbus, and will shortly possess a third. \"The\r\nFirst Inspiration of the Boy Columbus\" is a beautiful example of the\r\nwork of Signor G. Monteverde, a celebrated Italian sculptor. It was made\r\nin Rome, in 1871, and, winning the first prize of a gold medal at Parma,\r\nin that year, was presented to the city of Boston by Mr. A. P.\r\nChamberlain of Concord, Mass. It represents Columbus as a youth, seated\r\nupon the capstan of a vessel, with an open book in his hand, his foot\r\ncarelessly swinging in an iron ring. In addition to this statue, a\r\n_replica_ of the Old Isabella statue (described on page 171, _ante_),\r\nis, it is understood, to be presented to the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUE AT GENOA.\r\n\r\nIn the Red Palace, Genoa, a statue of Columbus has been erected\r\nrepresenting him standing on the deck of the Santa Maria, behind a padre\r\nwith a cross. The pedestal of the statue is ornamented with prows of\r\ncaravels, and on each side a mythological figure represents Discovery\r\nand Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATUE AT PALOS.\r\n\r\nNow in course of erection to commemorate the discovery, and under the\r\nauspices of the Spanish government, is a noble statue at Palos, Spain.\r\nIt consists of a fluted column of the Corinthian order of architecture,\r\ncapped by a crown, supporting an orb, surmounted by a cross. The orb\r\nbears two bands, one about its equator and the other representing the\r\nzodiac. On the column are the names of the Pinzon brothers, Martin and\r\nVicente Yañez; and under the prows of the caravels, \"Colon,\" with a list\r\nof the persons who accompanied him. The column rests upon a prismatic\r\nsupport, from which protrude four prows, and the pedestal of the whole\r\nis in the shape of a tomb, with an Egyptian-like appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATUE IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nIn Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, Pa., there is placed a statue of\r\nColumbus, which, originally exhibited at the Centennial Exposition, at\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1876, was presented to the Centennial Commission by the\r\ncombined Italian societies of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEBBINS STATUE.\r\n\r\nIn Central Park, New York City, is located an artistic statue, the gift\r\nof Mrs. Marshall O. Roberts, and the work of Miss Emma Stebbins. The\r\nfigure of Columbus is seven feet high, and represents him as a sailor\r\nwith a mantle thrown over his shoulder. The face is copied from accepted\r\nportraits of the Giovian type.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTO DOMINGOAN CANNON.\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus was made a prisoner in Santo Domingo, the governor, who\r\narrested him, feared there might be an attempt at rescue, so he trained\r\na big gun on the entrance of the citadel, or castle, in which Columbus\r\nwas confined. That cannon laid in the same place until Mr. Ober, a\r\nWorld's Fair representative, recovered it, and, with the permission of\r\nthe Governor of Santo Domingo, brought it to the United States. It is on\r\nexhibition at the World's Fair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SANTA MARIA CARAVEL.\r\n\r\nA very novel feature of the historical exhibit at the Chicago World's\r\nColumbian Exposition will be a fac-simile reproduction of the little\r\nship Santa Maria, in which Columbus sailed. Lieut. McCarty Little of the\r\nUnited States navy was detailed to go to Spain to superintend the\r\nconstruction of the ship by the Spanish government at the Carraca yard\r\nat Cadiz. The keel was laid on March 1, 1892. The caravel's dimensions\r\nare: Length at keel, 62 feet 4 inches; length between perpendiculars, 75\r\nfeet 5 inches; beam, 22 feet; draught, 14 feet 8 inches. Great care is\r\nbeing taken with details. It is manned by Spanish sailors in the costume\r\nof the time of Columbus, and is rigged as Columbus rigged his ship.\r\nThere are on board copies of the charts that Columbus used, and\r\nfac-similes of his nautical instruments. The crew are of the same\r\nnumber, and included in it are an Englishman and an Irishman, for it is\r\na well-founded historical fact that William Harris, an Englishman, and\r\nArthur Lake, an Irishman, were both members of Columbus' crew. In fact,\r\nthe reproduction is as exact as possible in every detail. The little\r\nship, in company with her sisters, the Pinta and the Niña, which were\r\nreproduced by American capital, will make its first appearance at the\r\nnaval review in New York, where the trio will be saluted by the great\r\ncruisers and war-ships of modern invention from all of the navies of the\r\nworld. They will then be presented by the government of Spain to the\r\nPresident of the United States, and towed through the lakes to Chicago,\r\nbeing moored at the Exposition. It is proposed that the vessels be taken\r\nto Washington after the Exposition, and there anchored in the park of\r\nthe White House.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish committee having the matter in charge have made careful\r\nexaminations of all obtainable data to insure that the vessels shall be,\r\nin every detail which can be definitely determined, exact copies of the\r\noriginal Columbus vessels. In connection with this subject, _La\r\nIlustracion National_ of Madrid, to whom we are indebted for our\r\nfirst-page illustration, says:\r\n\r\n\"A great deal of data of very varied character has been obtained, but\r\nnothing that would give the exact details sought, because, doubtless,\r\nthe vessels of that time varied greatly, not only in the form of their\r\nhulls, but also in their rigging, as will be seen by an examination of\r\nthe engravings and paintings of the fifteenth century; and as there was\r\nno ship that could bear the generic name of 'caravel,' great confusion\r\nwas caused when the attempt was made to state, with a scientific\r\ncertainty, what the caravels were. The word 'caravel' comes from the\r\nItalian _cara bella_, and with this etymology it is safe to suppose that\r\nthe name was applied to those vessels on account of the grace and beauty\r\nof their form, and finally was applied to the light vessels which went\r\nahead of the ships as dispatch boats. Nevertheless, we think we have\r\nvery authentic data, perhaps all that is reliable, in the letter of Juan\r\nde la Cosa, Christopher Columbus' pilot. Juan de la Cosa used many\r\nillustrations, and with his important hydrographic letter, which is in\r\nthe Naval Museum, we can appreciate his ability in drawing both\r\nlandscapes and figures. As he was both draughtsman and mariner, we feel\r\nsafe in affirming that the caravels drawn in said letter of the\r\nillustrious mariner form the most authentic document in regard to the\r\nvessels of his time that is in existence. From these drawings and the\r\ndescriptions of the days' runs in the part marked 'incidents' of\r\nColumbus' log, it is ascertained that these vessels had two sets of\r\nsails, lateens for sailing with bowlines hauled, and with lines for\r\nsailing before the wind.\r\n\r\n\"The same lateens serve for this double object, unbending the sails half\r\nway and hoisting them like yards by means of top ropes. Instead of\r\nhaving the points now used for reefing, these sails had bands of canvas\r\ncalled bowlines, which were unfastened when it was unnecessary to\r\ndiminish the sails.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAT PALOS.\r\n\r\n     From the _Saturday Review_, August 6, 1892.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy notion, and creditable to the ingenuity of the Spaniards,\r\nto celebrate the auspicious event, which made Palos famous four hundred\r\nyears ago, by a little dramatic representation. The caravel Maria,\r\nmanned by appropriately dressed sailors, must be a sight better than\r\nmany eloquent speeches. She has, we are told, been built in careful\r\nimitation of the flagship of Columbus' little squadron. If the fidelity\r\nof the builders has been thorough, if she has not been coppered, has no\r\ninner skin, and has to trust mainly to her caulking to keep out the\r\nwater, we hope that she will have unbroken good weather on her way to\r\nNew York. The voyage to Havana across the \"Ladies' Sea\" is a simple\r\nbusiness; but the coast of the United States in early autumn will be\r\ntrying to a vessel which will be buoyant enough as long as she is\r\nwater-tight, but is not to be trusted to remain so under a severe\r\nstrain. She will not escape the strain wholly by being towed. We are not\r\ntold whether the Maria is to make the landfall of Columbus as well as\r\ntake his departure. The disputes of the learned as to the exact spot\r\nmight make it difficult to decide for which of the Bahamas the captain\r\nought to steer. On the other hand, if it were left to luck, to the wind,\r\nand the currents, the result might throw some light on a vexed question.\r\nIt might be interesting to see whether the Maria touched at Turk Island,\r\nWatling's Island, or Mariguana, or at none of the three.\r\n\r\nThe event which the Spaniards are celebrating with natural pride is\r\npeculiarly fitted to give an excuse for a centenary feast. The\r\ncomplaints justly made as to the artificial character of the excuses\r\noften chosen for these gatherings and their eloquence do not apply here.\r\nBeyond all doubt, when Columbus sailed from Palos on August 3, 1492, he\r\ndid something by which the history of the world was profoundly\r\ninfluenced. Every schoolboy of course knows that if Columbus had never\r\nlived America would have been discovered all the same, when Pedro\r\nAlvarez Cabral, the Portuguese admiral, was carried by the trade-winds\r\nover to the coast of Brazil in 1500. But in that case it would not have\r\nbeen discovered by Spain, and the whole course of the inevitable\r\nEuropean settlement on the continent must have been modified.\r\n\r\nWhen that can be said of any particular event there can be no question\r\nas to its importance. There is a kind of historical critic, rather\r\nconspicuous in these latter days, who finds a peculiar satisfaction in\r\npointing out that Columbus discovered America without knowing it--which\r\nis true. That he believed, and died in the belief, that he had reached\r\nAsia is certain. It is not less sure that Amerigo Vespucci, from whom\r\nthe continent was named, by a series of flukes, misprints, and\r\nmisunderstandings, went to his grave in the same faith. He thought that\r\nhe had found an island of uncertain size to the south of the equator,\r\nand that what Columbus had found to the north was the eastern extremity\r\nof Asia. But the world which knows that Columbus did, as a matter of\r\nfact, do it the service of finding America, and is aware that without\r\nhim the voyage from Palos would never have been undertaken, has refused\r\nto belittle him because he did not know beforehand what was only found\r\nout through his exertions.\r\n\r\nThe learned who have written very largely about Columbus have their\r\nserious doubts as to the truth of the stories told of his connection\r\nwith Palos. Not that there is any question as to whether he sailed from\r\nthere. The dispute is as to the number and circumstances of his visits\r\nto the Convent of Santa Maria Rábida, and the exact nature of his\r\nrelations to the Prior Juan Perez de Marchena. There has, in fact, been\r\na considerable accumulation of what that very rude man, Mr. Carlyle,\r\ncalled the marine stores of history about the life of Columbus, as about\r\nmost great transactions. He certainly had been at La Rábida, and the\r\nprior was his friend. But, with or without Juan Perez, Columbus as a\r\nseafaring man would naturally have been in Palos. It lies right in the\r\nmiddle of the coast, which has always been open to attack from Africa\r\nand has been the starting point for attack on Africa. It is in the way\r\nof trade for the same reason that it is in the way of war. What are now\r\nfishing villages were brisk little trading towns in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries. Palos did not only send out Columbus. It received\r\nCortez when he came back from the conquest of Mexico. Palos does very\r\nwell to remember its glories. And Spain does equally well to remember\r\nthat she sent out Columbus. In spite of the platitudes talked by\r\npainfully thoughtful persons as to the ruinous consequences of the\r\ndiscovery to herself, it was, take it altogether, the greatest thing she\r\nhas done in the world. She owes to it her unparalleled position in the\r\nsixteenth century, and the opportunity to become \"a mother of nations.\"\r\nThe rest of the world has to thank her for the few magnificent and\r\npicturesque passages which enliven the commonly rather colorless, not to\r\nsay Philistine, history of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nA REMINISCENCE OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     RANDALL N.

I see the stern lines\r\nof care, deeper from the contrast of the hair, a silver mantle refined\r\nby the worry; the \"midnight oil\" that burned in the fiery furnace of his\r\nambition. I see the flush of pleasure at setting out to battle with the\r\nperilous sea toward the consummation of life's grand desire. I feel the\r\nwaverings between hope and despair as the journey lengthens, with but\r\nfaint promise of reward, and with those around who would push us into\r\nthe overwhelming waves of defeat and remorse. Amid all discouragements,\r\namid the darkest gloom, I am inspired by his words, \"Sail on, sail on\";\r\nand sailing on with the grand old Genoese, I yet hope to know and feel\r\nhis glorious success, and with him to return thanks on the golden strand\r\nof the San Salvador of life's success.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DENSE IGNORANCE OF THOSE DAYS.\r\n\r\n     The Reverend MINOT JUDSON SAVAGE, an American clergyman. Born at\r\n     Norridgewock, Maine, June 10, 1841. Pastor of Unity Church, Boston.\r\n     From his lecture, \"The Religious Growth of Three Hundred Years.\"\r\n\r\nStand beside Columbus a moment, and consider how much and how little\r\nthere was known. It was commonly believed that the earth was flat and\r\nwas flowed round by the ocean stream. Jerusalem was the center. With the\r\nexception of a little of Europe, a part of Asia, and a strip of North\r\nAfrica, the earth was unknown country. In these unknown parts dwelt\r\nmonsters of every conceivable description. Columbus indeed cherished the\r\ndaring dream that he might reach the eastern coast of Asia by sailing\r\nwest; but most of those who knew his dreams regarded him as crazy. And\r\nit is now known that even he was largely impelled by his confident\r\nexpectation that he would be able to discover the Garden of Eden. The\r\nmotive of his voyage was chiefly a religious one. And, as a hint of the\r\nkind of world in which people then lived, the famous Ponce de Leon\r\nsearched Florida in the hope of discovering the Fountain of Perpetual\r\nYouth. At this time Copernicus and his system were unheard of. The\r\nuniverse was a little three-story affair. Heaven, with God on his throne\r\nand his celestial court about him, was only a little way overhead--just\r\nbeyond the blue dome. Hell was underneath the surface of the earth.\r\nVolcanoes and mysterious caverns were vent-holes or gate-ways of the\r\npit; and devils came and went at will. Even after it was conceded that\r\nthe earth revolved, there were found writers who accounted for the\r\ndiurnal revolution by attributing it to the movements of damned souls\r\nconfined within, like restless squirrels in a revolving cage. On the\r\nearth's surface, between heaven and hell, was man, the common\r\nbattleground of celestial and infernal hosts. At this time, of\r\ncourse, there was none of our modern knowledge of the heavens, nor of\r\nthe age or structure of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Harper's Weekly.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1892, by Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\n  THE COLUMBUS MONUMENT, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n  Presented by the Italian Citizens.\r\n  (See page 243.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSENECA'S PROPHECY.\r\n\r\n     LUCIUS ANNÆUS SENECA, an eminent Roman stoic, philosopher, and\r\n     moralist.

To cross the seas of Life, naught\r\nsuffices save the bark of Faith. In that bark the undoubting Columbus\r\nset sail, and at his journey's end found a new world. Had that world not\r\nthen existed, God would have created it in the solitude of the Atlantic,\r\nif to no other end than to reward the faith and constancy of that great\r\nman.

D., and he added\r\nthe interesting suggestion that as it is the duty of a bishop so placed\r\nat a distance to report from time to time to the Pope, not only on\r\necclesiastical matters, but of the geography of the country and\r\ncharacter of the people, it is probable that Columbus had the benefit of\r\nthe knowledge possessed. It is [he said] stated in different biographies\r\nof Columbus that when the voyage was first proposed by him he found\r\ndifficulty in getting Spanish sailors to go with him in so doubtful an\r\nundertaking. After Columbus returned from a visit to Rome with\r\ninformation there obtained, these sailors, or enough of them, appear to\r\nhave had their doubts or fears removed, and no difficulty in enlistment\r\nwas experienced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA.\r\n\r\n     LYDIA HUNTLEY SIGOURNEY, an American poet and miscellaneous writer.\r\n     Born at Norwich, Conn., September 1, 1791; died, June 10, 1865.\r\n\r\n  St. Stephen's cloistered hall was proud\r\n    In learning's pomp that day,\r\n  For there a robed and stately crowd\r\n    Pressed on in long array.\r\n  A mariner with simple chart\r\n    Confronts that conclave high,\r\n  While strong ambition stirs his heart,\r\n  And burning thoughts of wonder part\r\n    From lip and sparkling eye.\r\n\r\n  What hath he said?

Born at\r\n     Haddington, Scotland, about 1815. From his volume, \"Duty.\"\r\n\r\nEven Columbus may be regarded in the light of a martyr. He sacrificed\r\nhis life to the discovery of a new world. The poor wool-carder's son of\r\nGenoa had long to struggle unsuccessfully with the petty conditions\r\nnecessary for the realization of his idea. He dared to believe, on\r\ngrounds sufficing to his reason, that which the world disbelieved, and\r\nscoffed and scorned at. He believed that the earth was round, while the\r\nworld believed that it was flat as a plate. He believed that the whole\r\ncircle of the earth, outside the known world, could not be wholly\r\noccupied by sea; but that the probability was that continents of land\r\nmight be contained within it. It was certainly a Probability; But the\r\nNoblest Qualities of the Soul Are Often Brought Forth by the Strength of\r\nProbabilities That Appear Slight To Less Daring Spirits. In the Eyes of\r\nHis Countrymen, Few Things Were More Improbable Than That Columbus\r\nShould Survive the Dangers of Unknown Seas, and Land On The Shores of a\r\nNew Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES BY THE WAY.\r\n\r\n     ROYALL BASCOM SMITHEY, in an article. \"The Voyage of Columbus,\" in\r\n     _St. Nicholas_, July, 1892.\r\n\r\nSo the voyage progressed without further incident worthy of remark till\r\nthe 13th of September, when the magnetic needle, which was then believed\r\nalways to point to the pole-star, stood some five degrees to the\r\nnorthwest. At this the pilots lost courage. \"How,\" they thought, \"was\r\nnavigation possible in seas where the compass, that unerring guide, had\r\nlost its virtue?\" When they carried the matter to Columbus, he at once\r\ngave them an explanation which, though not the correct one, was yet very\r\ningenious, and shows the philosophic turn of his mind. The needle, he\r\nsaid, pointed not to the north star, but to a fixed place in the\r\nheavens. The north star had a motion around the pole, and in following\r\nits course had moved from the point to which the needle was always\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nHardly had the alarm caused by the variation of the needle passed away,\r\nwhen two days later, after nightfall, the darkness that hung over the\r\nwater was lighted up by a great meteor, which shot down from the sky\r\ninto the sea. Signs in the heavens have always been a source of terror\r\nto the uneducated; and this \"flame of fire,\" as Columbus called it,\r\nrendered his men uneasy and apprehensive. Their vague fears were much\r\nincreased when, on the 16th of September, they reached the Sargasso Sea,\r\nin which floating weeds were so densely matted that they impeded the\r\nprogress of the ships. Whispered tales now passed from one sailor to\r\nanother of legends they had heard of seas full of shoals and treacherous\r\nquicksands upon which ships had been found stranded with their sails\r\nflapping idly in the wind, and manned by skeleton crews. Columbus, ever\r\ncheerful and even-tempered, answered these idle tales by sounding the\r\nocean and showing that no bottom could be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESIGN FOR THE SOUVENIR COINS.[57]\r\n\r\nA decision has been reached by the World's Fair management in relation\r\nto the designs for the souvenir coins authorized by Congress at its last\r\nsession, and a radical change has been determined upon regarding these\r\ncoins. Several days ago Secretary Leach of the United States Mint sent\r\nto the Fair officials a copy of the medal struck recently at Madrid,\r\nSpain, in commemoration of Columbus' discovery of America. This medal\r\nwas illustrated in a Spanish-American paper of July, 1892, and showed a\r\nremarkably fine profile head of the great explorer. It was deemed\r\nsuperior to the Lotto portrait previously submitted for the obverse of\r\nthe coin, and the Fair directors have concluded that the Madrid medal\r\nfurnishes the best head obtainable, and have accordingly adopted it. For\r\nthe reverse of the coin a change has also been decided upon by the\r\nsubstitution of a representation of the western continent instead of a\r\nfac-simile of the Government building at Jackson Park, as originally\r\nintended. It was suggested by experts, artists, and designers at the\r\nPhiladelphia mint that the representation of a building would not make a\r\nvery good showing on a coin, and in consequence of these expressions of\r\nopinion it was decided to make the change proposed. Now that the\r\nDirector of the Mint knows what the Fair management wishes for a\r\nsouvenir coin, he will inaugurate the preparations of the dies and\r\nplates as promptly as possible. Just as soon as the designs are\r\nfinished, work will be begun on the coins, which can be struck at the\r\nrate of 60,000 daily, and it is quite likely that the deliveries of the\r\nsouvenir coins will be completed early in the spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Harper's Weekly.\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1892, by Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nBAS-RELIEF--THE SIGHTING OF THE NEW WORLD. From the Columbus Monument in\r\nNew York City. (See page 244.)]\r\n\r\nThe announcement that the Director of the Mint has decided upon the\r\nMadrid portrait of Columbus for the obverse side of the souvenir coin,\r\nwith this hemisphere on the reverse, was a surprise to many interested\r\nin the designs. When the design was first presented, C. F. Gunther's\r\nportrait, by Moro, and James W. Ellsworth's, by Lotto, were also\r\npresented. Then a controversy opened between the owners of the two\r\nlast-named portraits, and, rather than extend this, Mr. Ellsworth\r\nwithdrew his portrait, with the suggestion that whatever design was\r\ndecided upon should first be submitted to the artists at the World's\r\nFair grounds. This was done, and they severely criticised the Madrid\r\npicture. Notwithstanding this, the design was approved and sent to\r\nWashington to be engraved. While Mr. Ellsworth, who is a director of the\r\nFair, will not push his portrait to the front in this matter, he regrets\r\nthat the Madrid portrait was selected. He said, \"I think that the\r\nopinion of the World's Fair artists should have had some weight in this\r\nmatter and that a portrait of authenticity should have been selected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DARKNESS BEFORE DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n     CHARLES SUMNER, an American lawyer and senator.

Lee & Shepard,\r\n     Publishers, Boston.\r\n\r\nBefore the voyage of Columbus in 1492, nothing of America was really\r\nknown. Scanty scraps from antiquity, vague rumors from the resounding\r\nocean, and the hesitating speculations of science were all that the\r\ninspired navigator found to guide him.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREATEST EVENT.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America by Christopher Columbus is the greatest event\r\nof secular history. Besides the potato, the turkey, and maize, which it\r\nintroduced at once for the nourishment and comfort of the Old World, and\r\nalso tobacco--which only blind passion for the weed could place in the\r\nbeneficent group--this discovery opened the door to influences infinite\r\nin extent and beneficence. Measure them, describe them, picture them,\r\nyou can not. While yet unknown, imagination invested this continent with\r\nproverbial magnificence. It was the Orient, and the land of Cathay.\r\nWhen, afterward, it took a place in geography, imagination found another\r\nfield in trying to portray its future history. If the golden age is\r\nbefore, and not behind, as is now happily the prevailing faith, then\r\nindeed must America share, at least, if it does not monopolize, the\r\npromised good.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOUBTS OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     Prof. DAVID SWING, a celebrated American preacher. Born in\r\n     Cincinnati in 1830; graduated at Miami University in 1852; was for\r\n     twelve years Professor of Languages at this university. In 1866 he\r\n     became pastor of a Presbyterian church in Chicago. He was tried for\r\n     heresy in 1874, was acquitted, and then withdrew from the\r\n     Presbyterian church, being now independent of denominational\r\n     relations.\r\n\r\nColumbus was not a little troubled all through his early life lest there\r\nmight be over the sea some land greater than Spain, a land unused; a\r\ngarden where flowers came and went unseen for ages, and where gold\r\nsparkled in the sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ERROR OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     From a sermon by Prof. SWING, printed in Chicago _Inter\r\n     Ocean_,1892.\r\n\r\nThe present rejoices in the remembrance that Columbus was a student, a\r\nthinker; that he loved maps and charts; that he was a dreamer about new\r\ncontinents; but after enumerating all these attractive forms of mental\r\nactivity, it comes with pain upon the thought that he was also a kind of\r\nmodified pirate. His thoughts and feelings went away from his charts and\r\ncompasses and touched upon vice and crime. Immorality ruins man's\r\nthought. Let the name be Columbus, or Aaron Burr, or Byron, a touch of\r\nimmorality is the death of thought. \"Whatsoever things are true,\r\nwhatsoever things are beautiful, whatsoever things are of good report,\"\r\nthese seek, say, and do, but when the man who would discover a continent\r\nrobs a merchant ship or steals a cargo of slaves, or when a poet teaches\r\ngross vulgarity, then the thinker is hemmed and degraded by criminality.\r\nIt is the glory of our age that it is washing white much of old thought.\r\nWhat is the emancipation of woman but the filtration of old thought? Did\r\nnot Columbus study and read and think, and then go out and load his ship\r\nwith slaves? Did not the entire man--man the thinker, the philosopher,\r\nthe theologian--cover himself with intellectual glory and then load his\r\nship with enslaved womanhood? Was not the scholar Columbus part pirate?\r\nWhat was in that atmosphere of the fifteenth century which could have\r\ngiven peculiar thoughts to Columbus alone? Was he alone in his piracy?\r\nIt is much more certain that the chains that held the negro held also\r\nall womanhood. All old thought thus awaited the electric process that\r\nshould weed ideas from crime. Our later years are active in\r\ndisentangling thought from injustice and vulgarity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUTE OF TASSO.\r\n\r\n     TORQUATO TASSO, a celebrated Italian epic poet.

From a description of Iceland.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that the knowledge of these voyages should not have\r\nbeen current in Iceland in 1477, when Columbus, sailing in a ship from\r\nBristol, England, visited the island. As he was able to converse with\r\nthe priests and learned men in Latin, he undoubtedly learned of the\r\nexistence of another continent to the west and south; and this\r\nknowledge, not the mere fanaticism of a vague belief, supported him\r\nduring many years of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLORY TO GOD.\r\n\r\n     The Rev.

This island has large lagoons, and is surrounded by a\r\nreef. So far it resembles Guanahani. But the second island, according to\r\nNavarrete, is Caicos, bearing W. N. W., while the second island of\r\nColumbus bore S. W. from the first. The third island of Columbus was in\r\nsight from the second. Inagua Chica (Little Inagua), Navarrete's third\r\nisland, is not in sight from Caicos. The third island of Columbus was 60\r\nmiles long. Inagua Chica is only 12 miles long. The fourth island of\r\nColumbus bore east from the third. Inagua Grande (Great Inagua),\r\nNavarrete's fourth island, bears southwest from Inagua Chica.\r\n\r\nCat Island was the landfall advocated by Washington Irving and Humboldt,\r\nmainly on the ground that it was called San Salvador on the West India\r\nmap in Blaeu's Dutch atlas of 1635. But this was done for no known\r\nreason but the caprice of the draughtsman. D'Anville copied from Blaeu\r\nin 1746, and so the name got into some later atlases. Cat Island does\r\nnot meet a single one of the requirements of the case. Guanahani had a\r\nreef round it, and a large lagoon in the center. Cat Island has no reef\r\nand no lagoon. Guanahani was low; Cat Island is the loftiest of the\r\nBahamas. The two islands could not be more different. Of course, in\r\nconducting Columbus from Cat Island to Cuba, Washington Irving is\r\nobliged to disregard all the bearings and distances given in the\r\njournal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The cross-staff had not then come into use, and it was\r\nnever of much service in low latitudes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: It was also resolved to establish in the city of\r\nWashington a Latin-American Memorial Library, wherein should be\r\ncollected all the historical, geographical, and literary works, maps,\r\nand manuscripts, and official documents relating to the history and\r\ncivilization of America, _such library to be solemnly dedicated on the\r\nday on which the United States celebrates the fourth centennial of the\r\ndiscovery of America_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Published by A.

The Tammany Society met in the great\r\nwigwam on the 12th day of October, 1792 (old style), and exhibited a\r\nmonumental obelisk, and an animated oration was delivered by J. B.\r\nJohnson, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Historical Society met at the house of the Rev. Dr.\r\nPeter Thacher, in Boston, the 23d day of October, 1792, and, forming in\r\nprocession, proceeded to the meeting-house in Brattle Street, where a\r\ndiscourse was delivered by the Rev. Jeremy Belknap upon the subject of\r\nthe \"Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus.\" He gave a concise\r\nand comprehensive narrative of the most material circumstances which led\r\nto, attended, or were consequent on the discovery of America. The\r\ncelebration commenced with an anthem. Mr. Thacher made an excellent\r\nprayer. Part of a psalm was then sung, and then Mr. Belknap delivered\r\nhis discourse, which was succeeded by a prayer from Mr. Eliot. Mr.\r\nThacher then read an ode composed for the occasion by Mr. Belknap, which\r\nwas sung by the choir. This finished the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe facts were brought to light by World's Fair Commissioner John Boyd\r\nThacher, New York. The account is taken from \"a journal of a gentleman\r\nvisiting Boston in 1792.\" The writer is said to have been Nathaniel\r\nCutting, a native of Brookline, Mass., and who, in the following year,\r\nwas appointed by Washington, upon the recommendation of Thomas\r\nJefferson, on a mission to the Dey of Algiers.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the Massachusetts Historical Society, in\r\nassuming to correct the old style date, October 12th, was guilty of the\r\nerror of dropping two unnecessary days. It dropped eleven days from the\r\ncalendar instead of nine, and at a subsequent meeting it determined to\r\ncorrect the date to October 21st, \"and that thereafter all celebrations\r\nof the Columbian discovery should fall on the 21st day of October.\"\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of the President establishing October 21st as the day\r\nof general observance of the anniversary of the Columbian discovery, and\r\nthe passage of Senator Hill's bill fixing the date for the dedication of\r\nthe buildings at Chicago, it is believed will forevermore fix October\r\n21st as the Columbian day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS' SUPREME SUSPENSE.\r\n\r\n     MAURICE THOMPSON, an American poet and novelist. Born at Fairfield,\r\n     Ind., September 9, 1844. From his \"Byways and Bird-notes.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a thrill is dashed through a moment of expectancy, a point of\r\nsupreme suspense, when by some time of preparation the source of\r\nsensation is ready for a consummation --a catastrophe! At such a time\r\none's soul is isolated so perfectly that it feels not the remotest\r\ninfluence from any other of all the universe. The moment preceding the\r\nold patriarch's first glimpse of the promised land; that point of time\r\nbetween certainty and uncertainty, between pursuit and capture,\r\nwhereinto are crowded all the hopes of a lifetime, as when the brave old\r\nsailor from Genoa first heard the man up in the rigging utter the shout\r\nof discovery; the moment of awful hope, like that when Napoleon watched\r\nthe charge of the Old Guard at Waterloo, is not to be described. There\r\nis but one such crisis for any man. It is the yes or no of destiny. It\r\ncomes, he lives a lifetime in its span; it goes, and he never can pass\r\nthat point again.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT WEST.\r\n\r\n     HENRY DAVID THOREAU, an American author and naturalist.

He appears\r\nto migrate westward daily, and tempt us to follow him. He is the Great\r\nWestern Pioneer whom the nations follow. We dream all night of those\r\nmountain ridges in the horizon, though they may be of vapor only, which\r\nwere last gilded by his rays. The Island of Atlantis, and the islands\r\nand gardens of the Hesperides, a sort of terrestrial paradise, appear\r\nto have been the Great West of the ancients, enveloped in mystery and\r\npoetry.

Bas-relief on the New York Monument. (See page\r\n244.)]\r\n\r\nColumbus felt the westward tendency more strongly than any before. He\r\nobeyed it, and found a new world for Castille and Leon. The herd of men\r\nin those days scented fresh pastures from afar.\r\n\r\n  And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,\r\n  And now was dropped into the western bay;\r\n  At last _he_ rose, and twitched his mantle blue;\r\n  To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROUTE TO THE SPICE INDIES.\r\n\r\n     PAOLO DEL POZZO TOSCANELLI, a celebrated Italian astronomer. Born\r\n     at Florence, 1397; died, 1482. From a letter to Columbus in 1474.\r\n\r\nI praise your desire to navigate toward the west; the expedition you\r\nwish to undertake is not easy, but the route from the west coasts of\r\nEurope to the spice Indies is certain if the tracks I have marked be\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO PALOS.\r\n\r\n     GEORGE ALFRED TOWNSEND. In a letter to the Philadelphia _Times_.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the hillocks behind the hotel at Huelva you can see in the\r\ndistance East Rábida, Palos, Moguer, San Juan del Porto, and the sea,\r\nwhere the three birds of good omen went skimming past in the vague\r\nmorning light 400 years ago, lest they might be seen by the Portuguese.\r\nColumbus means dove, and the arms of Columbus contained three doves.\r\nFrom Huelva I sailed to Rábida first. Rábida is on the last point of the\r\npromontory, nearest the sea, and Palos is inland from it three miles\r\nnorth, and is near half a mile from the Tinto. Passing down the oozy\r\nOdiel, we soon saw a watering place on the beach outside just where\r\nColumbus put to sea. We could also see the scaffolding around the\r\nColumbus monument they were building by Rábida.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting the convent at Rábida, I bade my skipper wait for flood\r\ntide to sail round to Palos, while I proceeded by land.\r\n\r\nThey brought me at Palos an old man who was extremely polite, but not\r\none word could we understand of each other, until finally I took him by\r\nthe arm and walked him in the direction of the church, whereupon\r\nsuppressed exclamations of delight broke forth; the American savage had\r\nguessed the old man out. In point of fact, this old man was waiting all\r\nthe time to take me to the church, and was the father of the boy behind\r\nwhom I had ridden. Between the church and the beach rose a high hillock\r\ncovered with grass, and as high as the church tower. In old times this\r\nwas a mosque of military work, and it had not very long been Christian\r\nwhen Columbus came here; possibly it had been Christian in his day 150\r\nyears. It stands quite alone, is of rude construction, and has at the\r\nback of it some few graves--perhaps of priests. In the back part is a\r\nvery good Moorish arch, which they still show with admiration. The front\r\nproper has a big door, barred strongly, as if the church might have been\r\nin piratical times a place of refuge for the population up in the hills.\r\nTo the right of the entrance is the tower, which is buttressed, and its\r\nspire is made of blue and colored tiles, which have thoroughly kept\r\ntheir colors. A bell in this tower may have rung the inhabitants to\r\nchurch when Columbus announced that he meant to impress the Palos people\r\nto assist him in his voyage. I entered the church, which was all\r\nwhitewashed, and felt, as I did at Rábida, that it was a better\r\nmonument than I had reason to expect.\r\n\r\nIts walls were one yard thick, its floors of tiles laid in an L form. As\r\nI measured the floor it seemed to me to be sixty-six feet wide and\r\nsixty-six feet long, but to the length must be added the altar chapel,\r\nbringing it up to ninety feet, and to the width must be added the side\r\nchapels, making the total width about eighty feet. The nave has a\r\nsharper arched top than the two aisles, which have round arches. The\r\nheight of the roof is about thirty-five feet. The big door by which I\r\nentered the church is fifteen feet high by eight feet wide. Some very\r\nodd settees which I coveted were in the nave. The chief feature,\r\nhowever, is the pulpit, which stands at the cross of the church, so that\r\npersons gathered in the transepts, nave, or aisles can hear the\r\npreacher. It has an iron pulpit of a round form springing from one stem\r\nand railed in, and steps lead up to it which are inclosed. It looks old,\r\nand worn by human hands, and is supposed to be the identical pulpit from\r\nwhich the notary announced that, as a punishment of their offenses, the\r\nQueen's subjects must start with this unknown man upon his unknown\r\nventure. Those were high times in Palos, and it took Columbus a long\r\nwhile to get his expedition ready, and special threats as of high\r\ntreason had to be made against the heads of families and women. But when\r\nColumbus returned, and the same day Pinzon came back after their\r\nseparation of weeks, Palos church was full of triumph and hosannas. The\r\nwild man had been successful, and Spain found another world than the\r\napostle knew of.\r\n\r\nThe grown boy, as he showed the building, went into an old lumber room,\r\nor dark closet, at one corner of the church, and when I was about to\r\nenter he motioned me back with his palm, as if I might not enter there\r\nwith my heretic feet. He then brought out an image of wood from four to\r\nfive feet high, or, I might say, the full size of a young woman. It was\r\nplain that she had once been the Virgin worshiped here, but age and\r\nmoisture had taken most of the color from her, and washed the gilt from\r\nher crown, and now we could only see that in her arm she bore a child,\r\nand this child held in its hand a dove or pigeon. The back of the female\r\nwas hollow, and in there were driven hooks by which she had once been\r\nsuspended at some height. This was the image, I clearly understood,\r\nwhich Columbus' men had knelt to when they were about to go forth upon\r\nthe high seas.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the church is named St. George, and St. George was the\r\npatron saint of Genoa, where Columbus was born; and the Genoese who took\r\nthe Crusaders to Jaffa had the satisfaction of seeing England annex\r\ntheir patron saint.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLE.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. LUTHER TRACY TOWNSEND, D. D., an American divine. Born at\r\n     Orono, Maine, September 27, 1838. From \"The Bible and the\r\n     Nineteenth Century.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Luther in the sixteenth century brought the truths of the Bible\r\nfrom the convent of Erfurth, and gave them to the people, he roused to\r\nmental and moral life not only the slumbering German nationality, but\r\ngave inspiration to every other country in Europe. \"Gutenburg with his\r\nprinting press, Columbus with his compass, Galileo with his telescope,\r\nShakspere with his dramas, and almost every other man of note figuring\r\nduring those times, are grouped, not around some distinguished man of\r\nscience, or man of letters, or man of mechanical genius, or man famous\r\nin war; but around that monk of Wittenberg, who stood with an unchained\r\nBible in his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF A CONTEMPORARY AS TO THE TREATMENT OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     From a letter of ANGELO TRIVIGIANO, of Granada, Spain, dated August\r\n     1, 1501.\r\n\r\nI have seen so much of Columbus that we are now on a footing of great\r\nfriendship. He is experiencing at present a streak of bad luck, being\r\ndeprived of the King's favor, and with but little money.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VALPARAISO STATUE.\r\n\r\nAt Valparaiso, Chili, a bronze statue of Columbus has been erected on a\r\nmarble pedestal.

In an article in the _Scientific\r\n     American_, June, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe stupid anecdote of the egg was a mere trifling invention, in fact a\r\ntrick, and it is surprising that intelligent men have for so many years\r\nthoughtlessly been believing and repeating such nonsense. For my part, I\r\ncan not believe that Columbus did ever lower himself so far as to\r\ncompare the grand discovery to a trick. Surely it was no trick by which\r\nhe discovered a new world, but it was the result of his earnest\r\nphilosophical convictions that our earth is a globe, floating in space,\r\nand it could be circumnavigated by sailing westward, which most likely\r\nwould lead to the discovery of new lands in the utterly unknown\r\nhemisphere beyond the western expanse of the great and boisterous\r\nAtlantic Ocean; while thus far no navigator ever had the courage to sail\r\ntoward its then utterly unknown, apparently limitless, western expanse.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN OF THE CHURCH.\r\n\r\n     Padre GIOCCHINO VENTURA, an eloquent Italian preacher and\r\n     theologian.

From a poem read in Cambridge in\r\n     1813.\r\n\r\n  And when in happier days one chain shall bind,\r\n  One pliant fetter shall unite mankind;\r\n  When war, when slav'ry's iron days are o'er,\r\n  When discords cease and av'rice is no more,\r\n  And with one voice remotest lands conspire,\r\n  To hail our pure religion's seraph fire;\r\n  Then fame attendant on the march of time,\r\n  Fed by the incense of each favored clime,\r\n  Shall bless the man whose heav'n-directed soul\r\n  Form'd the vast chain which binds the mighty whole.\r\n\r\n   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nColumbus continued till death eager to extend his discoveries, and by so\r\ndoing to promote the glory of his persecutors.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANDERLYN'S PICTURE AT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe first of the eight pictures in the rotunda of the Capitol at\r\nWashington, D. C., and the first in point of event, is the \"Landing of\r\nColumbus at San Salvador in 1492,\" by John Vanderlyn; its cost was\r\n$12,000. This picture represents the scene Washington Irving so\r\nadmirably describes in his \"Voyages of Columbus,\" occurring the morning\r\nthe boats brought the little Spanish band from the ships to the shore of\r\nGuanahani. \"Columbus first threw himself upon his knees; then, rising,\r\ndrew his sword, displayed the royal standard, and, assembling around him\r\nthe two captains, with Rodrigo de Escobedo, notary of the armament;\r\nRodrigo Sanchez (the royal inspector), and the rest who had landed, he\r\ntook solemn possession of the island in the name of the Castilian\r\nsovereigns.\" The picture contains the picture of Columbus, the two\r\nPinzons, Escobedo, all bearing standards; Sanchez, inspector; Diego de\r\nArana, with an old-fashioned arquebus on his shoulder; a cabin-boy\r\nkneeling, a mutineer in a suppliant attitude, a sailor in an attitude of\r\nveneration for Columbus, a soldier whose attention is diverted by the\r\nappearance of the natives, and a friar bearing a crucifix.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS STATUE AT WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nThe Columbus statue stands at the east-central portico of the Capitol,\r\nat Washington, D. C., above the south end of the steps, on an elevated\r\nblock. It consists of a marble group, by Signor Persico, called \"The\r\nDiscovery,\" on which he worked five years, and is composed of two\r\nfigures: Columbus holding the globe in his hand, triumphant, while\r\nbeside him, wondering, almost terror-stricken, is a female figure,\r\nsymbolizing the Indian race. The suit of armor worn by Columbus is said\r\nto be a faithful copy of one he actually wore. The group cost $24,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATLING'S ISLAND MONUMENT RAISED BY THE CHICAGO \"HERALD.\"\r\n\r\nWith true Chicago enterprise, the wideawake Chicago _Herald_ dispatched\r\nan expedition to the West Indies in 1891 to search out the landing place\r\nof Columbus. The members of the party, after careful search and inquiry,\r\nerected a monument fifteen feet high on Watling's Island bearing the\r\nfollowing inscription:\r\n\r\n  ON THIS SPOT\r\n  CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS\r\n  FIRST SET FOOT ON THE SOIL OF THE NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Erected by\r\n  The Chicago _Herald_,\r\n  June 15, 1891.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *\r\n\r\n  COLUMBUS.\r\n  FOR THE FESTIVAL AT HUELVA.\r\n\r\n  _Á Castillo, y á Leon\r\n  Nuevo Mundo dió Colon._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODORE WATTS, in the _Athenæum_ (England).\r\n\r\n  To Christ he cried to quell Death's deafening measure,\r\n    Sung by the storm to Death's own chartless sea;\r\n    To Christ he cried for glimpse of grass or tree\r\n  When, hovering o'er the calm, Death watch'd at leisure;\r\n  And when he showed the men, now dazed with pleasure,\r\n    Faith's new world glittering star-like on the lee,\r\n    \"I trust that by the help of Christ,\" said he,\r\n  \"I presently shall light on golden treasure.\"\r\n\r\n  What treasure found he? Chains and pains and sorrow.\r\n    Yea, all the wealth those noble seekers find\r\n    Whose footfalls mark the music of mankind.\r\n  'Twas his to lend a life; 'twas man's to borrow;\r\n  'Twas his to make, but not to share, the morrow,\r\n    Who in love's memory lives this morn enshrined.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST INDIAN STATUES.\r\n\r\nCARDENAS, CUBA.--At Cardenas, Cuba, a statue by Piguer of Madrid has\r\nbeen erected by a Cuban lady, an authoress, and wife of a former\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF COLUMBUS In the Courtyard of the\r\nCaptain-General's Palace, Havana, Cuba (See page 313.)]\r\n\r\nCATHEDRAL OF HAVANA, CUBA.--In the Cathedral of Havana there is a\r\nplain marble bas-relief, about four feet high, representing in a\r\nmedallion a very apocryphal portrait of Columbus, with an inscription as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _O restos é Ymajen del grande Colon!\r\n  Mil siglos durad guardados en la urna\r\n  Y en la remembranza de nuestra Nacion._\r\n\r\n  (O remains and image of the great Columbus!\r\n  For a thousand ages endure guarded within this urn\r\n  And in the remembrance of our nation.)\r\n\r\nPROPOSED TOMB--HAVANA CATHEDRAL.--In February, 1891, by royal decree,\r\nall Spanish artists were invited to compete for a design for a sepulcher\r\nin which to preserve the Havana remains of Columbus; several were\r\nsubmitted to a jury, who awarded the first prize to Arthur Melida, with\r\na premium of $5,000.\r\n\r\nThe sepulcher is now being erected in the cathedral. The design\r\nrepresents a bier covered with a heavily embroidered pall, borne upon\r\nthe shoulders of four heralds, in garments richly carved to resemble\r\nlace and embroidered work. The two front figures bear scepters\r\nsurmounted by images of the Madonna and St. James, the patron saint of\r\nSpain. On the front of their garments are the arms of Castille and Leon.\r\n\r\nThe two bearers represent Aragon and Navarre, the former being indicated\r\nby four red staffs on a gold field, and the fourth has gold-linked\r\nchains on a red field. The group is supported on a pedestal ornamented\r\nabout its edge with a Greek fret.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVANA, CUBA.--In the court-yard of the Captain-General's palace, in\r\nHavana, is a full-length figure of Columbus, the face modeled after\r\naccepted portraits at Madrid.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVANA, CUBA.--In the inclosure of the \"Templete,\" the little chapel on\r\nthe site of which the first mass was celebrated in Cuba, there is a\r\nbust of Columbus which has the solitary merit of being totally unlike\r\nall others.\r\n\r\nNASSAU.--At Nassau, in the Bahamas, a statue of Christopher Columbus\r\nstands in front of Government House. The statue, which is nine feet\r\nhigh, is placed upon a pedestal six feet in altitude, on the north or\r\nseaward face of which is inscribed:\r\n\r\n  COLUMBUS, 1492.\r\n\r\nIt was presented to the colony by Sir James Carmichael Smyth, Governor\r\nof the Bahamas, 1829-1833, was modeled in London in 1831, is made of\r\nmetal and painted white, and was erected May, 1832.\r\n\r\nSANTO DOMINGO CATHEDRAL.--Above the _boveda_, or vault, in the Cathedral\r\nof Santo Domingo, from which the remains of Columbus were taken in 1877,\r\nis a marble slab with the following:\r\n\r\n_Reposaron en este sitio los restos de Don Cristobal Colon el célebre\r\ndescrubridor del Nuevo Mundo, desde el año de 1536, en que fueron\r\ntrasladados de España, hasta el 10 de Setiembre 1877, en que se\r\ndesenterraron para constatar su autenticidad. Y á posteridad la dedica\r\nel Presbitero Billini._\r\n\r\n(There reposed in this place the remains of Christopher Columbus, the\r\ncelebrated discoverer of the New World, from the year 1536, in which\r\nthey were transferred from Spain, until the 10th September, 1877, in\r\nwhich year they were disinterred for the purpose of identification.\r\nDedicated to posterity by Padre Billini) (curate in charge when the\r\nvault was opened.)\r\n\r\nIn the cathedral there is also preserved a large cross of mahogany,\r\nrough and uneven, as though hewn with an adze out of a log, and then\r\nleft in the rough. This, it is claimed, is the cross made by Columbus\r\nand erected on the opposite bank of the Ozama River, where the first\r\nsettlement in the West Indies was made. In a little room by itself they\r\nkeep a leaden casket, which Santo Domingoans claim contains the bones of\r\nChristopher Columbus, and, in another, those of his brother.\r\n\r\nPLAZA OF SANTO DOMINGO.--Humboldt once wrote that America could boast of\r\nno worthy monument to its discoverer, but since his time many memorials\r\nhave been erected, not only in the New World, but the Old. In the plaza\r\nin front of the cathedral, in the city of Santo Domingo, stands a\r\nstatue, heroic, in bronze, representing Columbus pointing to the\r\nwestward. Crouched at his feet is the figure of a female Indian,\r\nsupposed to be the unfortunate Anacaona, the caciquess of Xaragua,\r\ntracing an inscription:\r\n\r\n  _Yllustre y Esclarecido Varon Don Cristoval Colon._\r\n\r\nThe statue was cast in France, a few years ago, and stands in the center\r\nof the plaza, in front of the cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS LORD NORTH'S \"BÊTE NOIR.\"\r\n\r\n     EDWIN PERCY WHIPPLE, a distinguished American critic and essayist.\r\n     Born at Gloucester, Mass., 1819; died, June 16, 1886.\r\n\r\nLord North more than once humorously execrated the memory of Columbus\r\nfor discovering a continent which gave him and his ministry so much\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDY MARINERS HAVE BECOME GREAT HEROES.\r\n\r\n     DANIEL APPLETON WHITE, a distinguished American jurist and scholar.\r\n     Born at Lawrence, Mass., June 7, 1776; died, March 30, 1861.\r\n\r\nHardy seamen, too, who have spent their days in conflict with the storms\r\nof the ocean, have found means to make themselves distinguished in\r\nscience and literature, as well as by achievements in their profession.\r\nThe life of Columbus gloriously attests this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nTASSO'S TRIBUTE IN ENGLISH SPENSERIAN STANZA.\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH HOLMES WIFFEN, an English writer and translator.

Born\r\n     at Berlin, Conn., 1787; died, 1870.\r\n\r\nSince the time when Noah left the ark to set his foot upon a recovered\r\nworld, a landing so sublime as that of Columbus had never occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GRAND PROPHETIC VISION.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. ELHANAN WINCHESTER, an American divine. Born at Brookline,\r\n     Mass., 1751; died, 1797. From an oration delivered in London,\r\n     October 12, 1792, the 300th anniversary of the landing of Columbus\r\n     in the New World. The orator, previous to a call to a pastorate in\r\n     London, had lived many years in America, being at one time pastor\r\n     of a large church in the city of Philadelphia. This oration should\r\n     be prized, so to speak, for its \"ancient simplicity.\" It is a relic\r\n     of the style used in addresses one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nI have for some years had it upon my mind that if Providence preserved\r\nmy life to the close of the third century from the discovery of America\r\nby Columbus, that I would celebrate that great event by a public\r\ndiscourse upon the occasion.\r\n\r\nAnd although I sincerely wish that some superior genius would take up\r\nthe subject and treat it with the attention that it deserves, yet,\r\nconscious as I am of my own inability, I am persuaded that America has\r\nnot a warmer friend in the world than myself.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America by Columbus was situated, in point of time,\r\nbetween two great events, which have caused it to be much more noticed,\r\nand have rendered it far more important than it would otherwise have\r\nbeen. I mean _the art of printing_, which was discovered about the year\r\n1440, and which has been and will be of infinite use to mankind, and\r\n_the Reformation_ from popery, which began about the year 1517, the\r\neffects of which have already been highly beneficial in a political as\r\nwell as in a religious point of view, and will continue and increase.\r\n\r\nThese three great events--_the art of printing_, the discovery of\r\nAmerica, and _the Reformation_--followed each other in quick succession;\r\nand, combined together, have already produced much welfare and happiness\r\nto mankind, and certainly will produce abundance more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the discovery of America there was much room given to the inhabitants\r\nof the Old World; an asylum was prepared for the persecuted of all\r\nnations to fly to for safety, and a grand theater was erected where\r\nLiberty might safely lift up her standard, and triumph over all the foes\r\nof freedom. America may be called _the very birthplace of civil and\r\nreligious liberty_, which had never been known to mankind until since\r\nthe discovery of that country.\r\n\r\nBut the importance of the discovery will appear greater and greater\r\nevery year, and one century to come will improve America far more than\r\nthe three centuries past.\r\n\r\nThe prospect opens; it extends itself upon us. \"The wilderness and\r\nsolitary place shall rejoice, the desert shall rejoice and blossom as\r\nthe rose.\" I look forward to that glorious era when that vast continent\r\nshall be fully populated with civilized and religious people; when\r\nheavenly wisdom and virtue, and all that can civilize, adorn, and bless\r\nthe children of men, shall cover that part of the globe as the waters\r\ncover the seas.\r\n\r\nTransported at the thought, I am borne forward to days of distant\r\nrenown. In my expanded view, the United States rise in all their ripened\r\nglory before me. I look through and beyond every yet peopled region of\r\nthe New World, and behold period still brightening upon period. Where\r\none contiguous depth of gloomy wilderness now shuts out even the beams\r\nof day, I see new states and empires, new seats of wisdom and knowledge,\r\nnew religious domes, spreading around. In places now untrod by any but\r\nsavage beasts, or men as savage as they, I hear the voice of happy\r\nlabor, and behold beautiful cities rising to view.\r\n\r\nLo, in this happy picture, I behold the native Indian exulting in the\r\nworks of peace and civilization; his bloody hatchet he buries deep under\r\nground, and his murderous knife he turns into a pruning fork, to lop the\r\ntender vine and teach the luxuriant shoot to grow. No more does he form\r\nto himself a heaven after death (according to the poet), in company with\r\nhis faithful dog, behind the cloud-topped hill, to enjoy solitary quiet,\r\nfar from the haunts of faithless men; but, better instructed by\r\nChristianity, he views his everlasting inheritance--\"a house not made\r\nwith hands, eternal in the heavens.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of recounting to his offspring, round the blazing fire, the\r\nbloody exploits of their ancestors, and wars of savage death, showing\r\nbarbarous exultation over every deed of human woe, methinks I hear him\r\npouring forth his eulogies of praise, in memory of those who were the\r\ninstruments of heaven in raising his tribes from darkness to light, in\r\ngiving them the blessings of civilized life, and converting them from\r\nviolence and blood to meekness and love.\r\n\r\nBehold the whole continent highly cultivated and fertilized, full of\r\ncities, towns, and villages, beautiful and lovely beyond expression. I\r\nhear the praises of my great Creator sung upon the banks of those rivers\r\nunknown to song. Behold the delightful prospect! see the silver and gold\r\nof America employed in the service of the Lord of the whole earth! See\r\nslavery, with all its train of attendant evil, forever abolished! See a\r\ncommunication opened through the whole continent, from north to south,\r\nand from east to west, through a most fruitful country! Behold the glory\r\nof God extending, and the gospel spreading, through the whole land!\r\n\r\nO my native country! though I am far distant from thy peaceful shores,\r\nwhich probably mine eyes may never more behold, yet I can never forget\r\nthee. May thy great Creator bless thee, and make thee a happy land,\r\nwhile thy rivers flow and thy mountains endure. And, though He has\r\nspoken nothing plainly in His word concerning thee, yet has he blest\r\nthee abundantly, and given thee good things in possession, and a\r\nprospect of more glorious things in time to come. His name shall be\r\nknown, feared, and loved through all thy western regions, and to the\r\nutmost bounds of thy vast extensive continent.\r\n\r\nO America! land of liberty, peace, and plenty, in thee I drew my first\r\nbreath, in thee all my kindred dwell. I beheld thee in thy lowest state,\r\ncrushed down under misfortunes, struggling with poverty, war, and\r\ndisgrace. I have lived to behold thee free and independent, rising to\r\nglory and extensive empire, blessed with all the good things of this\r\nlife, and a happy prospect of better things to come. I can say, \"Lord,\r\nnow lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen\r\nthy salvation,\" which thou hast made known to my native land, in the\r\nsight, and to the astonishment, of all the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nI die; but God will surely visit America, and make it a vast flourishing\r\nand extensive empire; will take it under His protection, and bless it\r\nabundantly--but the prospect is too glorious for my pen to describe. I\r\nadd no more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF COLUMBUS, IN FAIRMOUNT PARK, PHILADELPHIA.\r\nPresented by Italian Citizens.

Born\r\n     at Bedford, N. H., 1758; died, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America was the greatest achievement of the kind ever\r\nperformed by man; and, considered in connection with its consequences,\r\nit is the greatest event of modern times. It served to wake up the\r\nunprecedented spirit of enterprise; it opened new sources of wealth, and\r\nexerted a powerful influence on commerce by greatly increasing many\r\nimportant articles of trade, and also by bringing into general use\r\nothers before unknown; by leading to the discovery of the rich mines of\r\nthis continent, it has caused the quantity of the precious metals in\r\ncirculation throughout the world to be exceedingly augmented; it also\r\ngave a new impulse to colonization, and prepared the way for the\r\nadvantages of civilized life and the blessings of =Christianity= to be\r\nextended over vast regions which before were the miserable abodes of\r\nbarbarism and pagan idolatry.\r\n\r\nThe man to whose genius and enterprise the world is indebted for this\r\ndiscovery was Christopher Columbus of Genoa. He conceived that in order\r\nto complete the balance of the terraqueous globe another continent\r\nnecessarily existed, which might be reached by sailing to the west from\r\nEurope; but he erroneously connected it with India. Being persuaded of\r\nthe truth of his theory, his adventurous spirit made him eager to verify\r\nit by experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF DISCOVERERS.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how few of the eminent men of the discoverers and\r\nconquerors of the New World died in peace. Columbus died broken-hearted;\r\nRoldan and Bobadilla were drowned; Ojeda died in extreme poverty;\r\nEncisco was deposed by his own men; Nicuesa perished miserably by the\r\ncruelty of his party; Balboa was disgracefully beheaded; Narvaez was\r\nimprisoned in a tropical dungeon, and afterward died of hardship; Cortez\r\nwas dishonored; Alvarado was destroyed in ambush; Pizarro was murdered,\r\nand his four brothers cut off; Sir Walter Raleigh was beheaded by an\r\nungrateful king; the noble and adventurous Robert La Salle, the explorer\r\nof the Mississippi Valley, was murdered by his mutinous crew; Sir Martin\r\nFrobisher died of a wound received at Brest; Sir Humphrey Gilbert,\r\nRaleigh's noble half-brother, \"as near to God by sea as by land,\" sank\r\nwith the crew of the little Squirrel in the deep green surges of the\r\nNorth Atlantic; Sir Francis Drake, \"the terror of the Spanish Main,\" and\r\nthe explorer of the coast of California, died of disease near Puerto\r\nBello, in 1595. The frozen wilds of the North hold the bones of many an\r\nintrepid explorer. Franklin and Bellot there sleep their last long\r\nsleep. The bleak snow-clad _tundra_ of the Lena delta saw the last\r\nmoments of the gallant De Long. Afric's burning sands have witnessed\r\nmany a martyrdom to science and religion. Livingston, Hannington,\r\nGordon, Jamieson, and Barttelot are golden names on the ghastly roll.\r\nAustralia's scrub-oak and blue-gum plains have contributed their quota\r\nof the sad and sudden deaths on the earth-explorers' roll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColumbus and Columbia.\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA.\r\n\r\n  Hail, Columbia! happy land!\r\n  Hail, ye heroes! heaven-born band!\r\n\r\n  _Joseph Hopkinson_, 1770-1842.\r\n\r\n  And ne'er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves,\r\n  While the earth bears a plant, or the sea rolls its waves.\r\n\r\n  _Robert Treat Paine_, 1772-1811.\r\n\r\n  Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise.\r\n  The queen of the world, and child of the skies!\r\n  Thy genius commands thee; with rapture behold\r\n  While ages on ages thy splendors unfold.\r\n\r\n  _Timothy Dwight_, 1752-1817.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FUTURITY.\r\n\r\n     JOHN ADAMS, second President of the United States.

Fresh scenes are\r\ncontinually disclosed by the frequent windings of the river, as you\r\nspeed along its rapid current. Thousands of birds in the adjacent woods\r\ngratify the ear with their sweet mellow notes, or dazzle the sight, as\r\nin their gorgeous attire they flash by. It was while ascending the Upper\r\nMississippi, during the month of February, 1814, that I first caught\r\nsight of the beautiful Bird of Washington. My delight was extreme. Not\r\neven Herschel, when he discovered the planet which bears his name, could\r\nhave experienced more rapturous feelings. Convinced that the bird was\r\nextremely rare, if not altogether unknown, I felt particularly anxious\r\nto learn its species. I next observed it whilst engaged in collecting\r\ncray fish on one of the flats of the Green River, at its junction with\r\nthe Ohio, where it is bounded by a range of high cliffs. I felt assured,\r\nby certain indications, that the bird frequented that spot. Seated about\r\na hundred yards from the foot of the rock, I eagerly awaited its\r\nappearance as it came to visit its nest with food for its young. I was\r\nwarned of its approach by the loud hissing of the eaglets, which crawled\r\nto the extremity of the cavity to seize the prey--a fine fish. Presently\r\nthe female, always the larger among rapacious birds, arrived, bearing\r\nalso a fish. With more shrewd suspicion than her mate, glaring with her\r\nkeen eye around, she at once perceived the nest had been discovered.\r\nImmediately dropping her prey, with a loud shriek she communicated the\r\nalarm, when both birds, soaring aloft, kept up a growling to intimidate\r\nthe intruders from their suspected design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Harper's Weekly.

Considering the bird the noblest of its kind, I\r\ndignified it with the great name to which this country owed her\r\nsalvation, and which must be imperishable therefore among her people.\r\nLike the eagle, Washington was brave; like it, he was the terror of his\r\nfoes, and his fame, extending from pole to pole, resembles the majestic\r\nsoarings of the mightiest of the feathered tribe.

Y. From his \"Patriotic Addresses.\" By permission of\r\n     Messrs. Fords, Howard & Hulbert, Publishers, New York.\r\n\r\nWhen a man of thoughtful mind sees a nation's flag, he sees not the flag\r\nonly, but the nation itself; and whatever may be its symbols, he reads\r\nchiefly in the flag the government, the principles, the truth, the\r\nhistory, which belong to the nation which sets it forth. When the French\r\ntricolor rolls out to the wind, we see France. When the newfound\r\nItalian flag is unfurled, we see Italy restored. When the other\r\nthree-cornered Hungarian flag shall be lifted to the wind, we shall see\r\nin it the long-buried, but never dead, principles of Hungarian liberty.\r\nWhen the united crosses of St. Andrew and St. George on a fiery ground\r\nset forth the banner of old England, we see not the cloth merely; there\r\nrises up before the mind the noble aspect of that monarchy which, more\r\nthan any other on the globe, has advanced its banner for liberty, law,\r\nand national prosperity. This nation has a banner, too, and wherever it\r\nstreamed abroad men saw daybreak bursting on their eyes, for the\r\nAmerican flag has been the symbol of liberty, and men rejoiced in it.\r\nNot another flag on the globe had such an errand, or went forth upon the\r\nseas carrying everywhere, the world around, such hope for the captive\r\nand such glorious tidings. The stars upon it were to the pining nations\r\nlike the morning stars of God, and the stripes upon it were beams of\r\nmorning light. As at early dawn the stars stand first, and then it grows\r\nlight, and then, as the sun advances, that light breaks into banks and\r\nstreaming lines of color, the glowing red and intense white striving\r\ntogether and ribbing the horizon with bars effulgent, so on the American\r\nflag stars and beams of many-colored lights shine out together. And\r\nwherever the flag comes, and men behold it, they see in its sacred\r\nemblazonry no rampant lion and fierce eagle, but only light, and every\r\nfold indicative of liberty. It has been unfurled from the snows of\r\nCanada to the plains of New Orleans; in the halls of the Montezumas and\r\namid the solitude of every sea; and everywhere, as the luminous symbol\r\nof resistless and beneficent power, it has led the brave to victory and\r\nto glory. It has floated over our cradles; let it be our prayer and our\r\nstruggle that it shall float over our graves.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SELF-RESPECT.\r\n\r\n     NATHANIEL S. S. BEMAN, an American Presbyterian divine. Born in New\r\n     Lebanon, N. Y., 1785; died at Carbondale, Ill., August 8, 1871. For\r\n     forty years pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, Troy, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe western continent has, at different periods, been the subject of\r\nevery species of transatlantic abuse. In former days, some of the\r\nnaturalists of Europe told us that everything here was constructed upon\r\na small scale. The frowns of nature were represented as investing the\r\nwhole hemisphere we inhabit. It has been asserted that the eternal\r\nstorms which are said to beat upon the brows of our mountains, and to\r\nroll the tide of desolation at their bases; the hurricanes which sweep\r\nour vales, and the volcanic fires which issue from a thousand flaming\r\ncraters; the thunderbolts which perpetually descend from heaven, and\r\nthe earthquakes, whose trepidations are felt to the very center of our\r\nglobe, have superinduced a degeneracy through all the productions of\r\nnature. Men have been frightened into intellectual dwarfs, and the\r\nbeasts of the forest have not attained more than half their ordinary\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the lines and touches of this picture have been blotted\r\nout by the reversing hand of time, others have been added, which have,\r\nin some respects, carried the conceit still farther. In later days, and,\r\nin some instances, even down to the present period, it has been\r\npublished and republished from the enlightened presses of the Old World,\r\nthat so strong is the tendency to deterioration on this continent that\r\nthe descendants of European ancestors are far inferior to the original\r\nstock from which they sprang. But inferior in what? In national spirit\r\nand patriotic achievement? Let the revolutionary conflict--the opening\r\nscenes at Boston and the catastrophe at Yorktown--furnish the reply. Let\r\nBennington and Saratoga support their respective claims. Inferior in\r\nenterprise? Let the sail that whitens every ocean, and the commercial\r\nspirit that braves every element and visits every bustling mart, refute\r\nthe unfounded aspersion. Inferior in deeds of zeal and valor for the\r\nChurch? Let our missionaries in the bosom of our own forest, in the\r\ndistant regions of the East, and on the islands of the great Pacific,\r\nanswer the question. Inferior in science and letters and the arts? It is\r\ntrue our nation is young; but we may challenge the world to furnish a\r\nnational maturity which, in these respects, will compare with ours.\r\n\r\nThe character and institutions of this country have already produced a\r\ndeep impression upon the world we inhabit. What but our example has\r\nstricken the chains of despotism from the provinces of South\r\nAmerica--giving, by a single impulse, freedom to half a hemisphere? A\r\nWashington here has created a Bolivar there. The flag of independence,\r\nwhich has waved from the summit of our Alleghany, has now been answered\r\nby a corresponding signal from the heights of the Andes. And the same\r\nspirit, too, that came across the Atlantic wave with the Pilgrims, and\r\nmade the rock of Plymouth the corner-stone of freedom, and of this\r\nrepublic, is traveling back to the East. It has already carried its\r\ninfluence into the cabinets of princes, and it is at this moment sung by\r\nthe Grecian bard and emulated by the Grecian hero.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA--A PROPHECY.\r\n\r\n     ST.

In Kate Field's _Washington_.\r\n\r\n  Puissant land! where'er I turn my eyes\r\n    I see thy banner strewn upon the breeze;\r\n  Each past achievement only prophesies\r\n    Of triumphs more unheard of.

From a speech delivered at\r\n     Birmingham, England, 1862.\r\n\r\nI have another and a far brighter vision before my gaze. It may be but a\r\nvision, but I will cherish it. I see one vast confederation stretching\r\nfrom the frozen North in unbroken line to the glowing South, and from\r\nthe wild billows of the Atlantic westward to the calmer waters of the\r\nPacific main; and I see one people and one language, and one faith and\r\none law, and, over all that wide continent, the home of freedom, and a\r\nrefuge for the oppressed of every race and every clime.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROTHERS ACROSS THE SEA.\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING, one of the most gifted female poets.\r\n     Born near Ledbury, Herefordshire, England, in 1807; died at\r\n     Florence, Italy, in June, 1861.\r\n\r\n  I heard an angel speak last night,\r\n               And he said, \"Write--\r\n      Write a nation's curse for me,\r\n      And send it over the western sea.\"\r\n  I faltered, taking up the word:\r\n               \"Not so, my lord!\r\n       If curses must be, choose another\r\n       To send thy curse against my brother.\r\n\r\n      For I am bound by gratitude,\r\n              By love and blood,\r\n      To brothers of mine across the sea,\r\n      Who stretch out kindly hands to me.\"\r\n  \"Therefore,\" the voice said, \"shalt thou write\r\n                My curse to-night;\r\n      From the summits of love a curse is driven,\r\n      As lightning is from the tops of heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRANDEUR OF DESTINY.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT, an eminent American poet.

P. Born at Belfast, Ireland, May 10, 1838.\r\n     Appointed Regius Professor of Civil Law to the University of\r\n     Oxford, England, 1870. From his \"American Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nAmericans seem to live in the future rather than in the present; not\r\nthat they fail to work while it is called to-day, but that they see the\r\ncountry, not merely as it is, but as it will be twenty, fifty, a hundred\r\nyears hence, when the seedlings shall have grown to forest trees. Time\r\nseems too brief for what they have to do, and result always to come\r\nshort of their desire. One feels as if caught and whirled along in a\r\nfoaming stream chafing against its banks, such is the passion of these\r\nmen to accomplish in their own lifetimes what in the past it took\r\ncenturies to effect. Sometimes, in a moment of pause--for even the\r\nvisitor finds himself infected by the all-pervading eagerness--one is\r\ninclined to ask them: \"Gentlemen, why in heaven's name this haste? You\r\nhave time enough. No enemy threatens you. No volcano will rise from\r\nbeneath you. Ages and ages lie before you. Why sacrifice the present to\r\nthe future, fancying that you will be happier when your fields teem with\r\nwealth and your cities with people? In Europe we have cities wealthier\r\nand more populous than yours, and we are not happy. You dream of your\r\nposterity; but your posterity will look back to yours as the golden age,\r\nand envy those who first burst into this silent, splendid nature, who\r\nfirst lifted up their axes upon these tall trees, and lined these waters\r\nwith busy wharves. Why, then, seek to complete in a few decades what\r\nthe other nations of the world took thousands of years over in the older\r\ncontinents? Why do rudely and ill things which need to be done well,\r\nseeing that the welfare of your descendants may turn upon them? Why, in\r\nyour hurry to subdue and utilize nature, squander her splendid gifts?\r\nWhy allow the noxious weeds of Eastern politics to take root in your new\r\nsoil, when by a little effort you might keep it pure? Why hasten the\r\nadvent of that threatening day when the vacant spaces of the continent\r\nshall all have been filled, and the poverty or discontent of the older\r\nStates shall find no outlet? You have opportunities such as mankind has\r\nnever had before, and may never have again. Your work is great and\r\nnoble; it is done for a future longer and vaster than our conceptions\r\ncan embrace. Why not make its outlines and beginnings worthy of these\r\ndestinies, the thought of which gilds your hopes and elevates your\r\npurposes?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF THE CONVENT OF SANTA MARIA DE LA RÁBIDA (HUELVA),\r\nSPAIN, WHERE COLUMBUS TOOK REFUGE.\r\n\r\nThis convent has been restored and preserved as a National Museum since\r\n1846.\r\n\r\n(See pages 17 and 275.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA'S UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH.\r\n\r\n     EDMUND BURKE, an illustrious orator, statesman, and philanthropist.\r\n     Born in Dublin, 1730; died, July 9, 1797. To Burke's eternal credit\r\n     and renown be it said, that, had his advice and counsels been\r\n     listened to, the causes which produced the American Revolution\r\n     would have been removed.\r\n\r\nI can not prevail on myself to hurry over this great consideration--the\r\nvalue of America to England. It is good for us to be here. We stand\r\nwhere we have an immense view of what is, and what is past. Clouds,\r\nindeed, and darkness, rest upon the future. Let us, however, before we\r\ndescend from this noble eminence, reflect that this growth of our\r\nnational prosperity has happened within the short period of the life of\r\nman. It has happened within sixty-eight years. There are those alive\r\nwhose memory might touch the two extremities. For instance, my Lord\r\nBathurst might remember all the stages of the progress. He was, in\r\n1704, of an age, at least, to be made to comprehend such things. Suppose\r\nthat the angel of this auspicious youth, foreseeing the many virtues\r\nwhich made him one of the most amiable, as he is one of the most\r\nfortunate, men of his age, had opened to him in vision, that when, in\r\nthe fourth generation, the third prince of the house of Brunswick had\r\nsat twelve years on the throne of that nation, which by the happy issue\r\nof moderate and healing councils was to be made Great Britain, he should\r\nsee his son, Lord Chancellor of England, turn back the current of\r\nhereditary dignity to its fountain, and raise him to a higher rank of\r\npeerage, whilst he enriched the family with a new one. If amidst these\r\nbright and happy scenes of domestic honor and prosperity that angel\r\nshould have drawn up the curtain and unfolded the rising glories of his\r\ncountry; and, whilst he was gazing with admiration on the then\r\ncommercial grandeur of England, the genius should point out to him a\r\nlittle speck, scarce visible in the mass of the national interest, a\r\nsmall seminal principle, rather than a formed body, and should tell him,\r\n\"Young man, there is America, which at this day serves for little more\r\nthan to amuse you with stories of savage men and uncouth manners; yet\r\nshall, before you taste of death, show itself equal to the whole of that\r\ncommerce which now attracts the envy of the world. Whatever England has\r\nbeen growing to by a progressive increase of improvement, brought in by\r\nvarieties of people, by succession of civilizing conquests and\r\ncivilizing settlements in a series of 1,700 years, you shall see as much\r\nadded to her by America in the course of a single life!\" If this state\r\nof his country had been foretold to him, would it not have required all\r\nthe sanguine credulity of youth, and all the fervid glow of enthusiasm,\r\nto make him believe it? Fortunate man, he has lived to see it!\r\nFortunate, indeed, if he live to see nothing to vary the prospect, and\r\ncloud the setting of his day!\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA THE CONTINENT OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n     EMILIO CASTELAR, one of Spain's most noted orators and statesmen.\r\n     His masterly articles on Columbus in the _Century Magazine_ alone\r\n     would insure an international reputation. From a speech in the\r\n     Spanish Cortes, 1871.\r\n\r\nAmerica, and especially Saxon America, with its immense virgin\r\nterritories, with its republic, with its equilibrium between stability\r\nand progress, with its harmony between liberty and democracy, is the\r\ncontinent of the future--the immense continent stretched by God between\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific, where mankind may plant, essay, and resolve\r\nall social problems. Europe has to decide whether she will confound\r\nherself with Asia, placing upon her lands old altars, and upon the\r\naltars old idols, and upon the idols immovable theocracies, and upon the\r\ntheocracies despotic empires; or whether she will go by labor, by\r\nliberty, and by the republic, to co-operate with America in the grand\r\nwork of universal civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOBLE CONCEPTIONS.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING, D. D., a distinguished American Unitarian\r\n     divine, and one of the most eloquent writers America has produced.\r\n     Born at Newport, R. I., April 7, 1780; died, October 2, 1842. From\r\n     an address on \"The Annexation of Texas to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we look forward to the probable growth of this country; when we\r\nthink of the millions of human beings who are to spread over our present\r\nterritory; of the career of improvement and glory opened to this new\r\npeople; of the impulse which free institutions, if prosperous, may be\r\nexpected to give to philosophy, religion, science, literature, and\r\narts; of the vast field in which the experiment is to be made; of what\r\nthe unfettered powers of man may achieve; of the bright page of history\r\nwhich our fathers have filled, and of the advantages under which their\r\ntoils and virtues have placed us for carrying on their work. When we\r\nthink of all this, can we help, for a moment, surrendering ourselves to\r\nbright visions of our country's glory, before which all the glories of\r\nthe past are to fade away? Is it presumption to say that if just to\r\nourselves and all nations we shall be felt through this whole continent;\r\nthat we shall spread our language, institutions, and civilization\r\nthrough a wider space than any nation has yet filled with a like\r\nbeneficent influence? And are we prepared to barter these hopes, this\r\nsublime moral empire, for conquests by force? Are we prepared to sink to\r\nthe level of unprincipled nations; to content ourselves with a vulgar,\r\nguilty greatness; to adopt in our youth maxims and ends which must brand\r\nour future with sordidness, oppression, and shame? Why can not we rise\r\nto noble conceptions of our destiny? Why do we not feel that our work as\r\na nation is to carry freedom, religion, science, and a nobler form of\r\nhuman nature over this continent? And why do we not remember that to\r\ndiffuse these blessings we must first cherish them in our own borders,\r\nand that whatever deeply and permanently corrupts us will make our\r\nspreading influence a curse, not a blessing, to this New World? It is a\r\ncommon idea in Europe that we are destined to spread an inferior\r\ncivilization over North America; that our absorption in gain and outward\r\ninterests mark us out as fated to fall behind the Old World in the\r\nhigher improvements of human nature--in the philosophy, the refinements,\r\nthe enthusiasm of literature and the arts, which throw a luster round\r\nother countries.

Born at\r\n     Essex, Mass., October 1, 1799; died at Halifax, N. S., July 13,\r\n     1858. From an Independence Day oration delivered in Boston.\r\n\r\nBut now there rises colossal the fine sweet spirit of nationality--the\r\nnationality of America. See there the pillar of fire which God has\r\nkindled, and lighted, and moved, for our hosts and our ages. Under such\r\nan influence you ascend above the smoke and stir of this small local\r\nstrife; you tread upon the high places of the earth and of history; you\r\nthink and feel as an American for America; her power, her eminence, her\r\nconsideration, her honor are yours; your competitors, like hers, are\r\nkings; your home, like hers, is the world; your path, like hers, is on\r\nthe highway of empires; your charge, her charge, is of generations and\r\nages; your record, her record, is of treaties, battles, voyages, beneath\r\nall the constellations; her image--one, immortal, golden--rises on your\r\neye as our western star at evening rises on the traveler from his home;\r\nno lowering cloud, no angry river, no lingering spring, no broken\r\ncrevasse, no inundated city or plantation, no tracts of sand, arid and\r\nburning, on that surface, but all blended and softened into one beam of\r\nkindred rays, the image, harbinger, and promise of love, hope, and a\r\nbrighter day.\r\n\r\nBut if you would contemplate nationality as an active virtue, look\r\naround you. Is not our own history one witness and one record of what it\r\ncan do? This day, the 4th of July, and all which it stands for--did it\r\nnot give us these? This glory of the fields of that war, this eloquence\r\nof that revolution, this one wide sheet of flame, which wrapped tyrant\r\nand tyranny, and swept all that escaped from it away, forever and\r\nforever; the courage to fight, to retreat, to rally, to advance, to\r\nguard the young flag by the young arm and the young heart's blood, to\r\nhold up and hold on till the magnificent consummation crown the\r\nwork--were not all these imparted or inspired by this imperial\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nLook at it! It has kindled us to no aims of conquest. It has involved us\r\nin no entangling alliances. It has kept our neutrality dignified and\r\njust. The victories of peace have been our prized victories. But the\r\nlarger and truer grandeur of the nations, for which they are created,\r\nand for which they must one day, before some tribunal, give account,\r\nwhat a measure of these it has enabled us already to fulfill! It has\r\nlifted us to the throne, and has set on our brow the name of the Great\r\nRepublic. It has taught us to demand nothing wrong and to submit to\r\nnothing wrong; it has made our diplomacy sagacious, wary, and\r\naccomplished; it has opened the iron gate of the mountain, and planted\r\nour ensign on the great tranquil sea. It has made the desert to bud and\r\nblossom as the rose; it has quickened to life the giant brood of useful\r\narts; it has whitened lake and ocean with the sails of a daring, new,\r\nand lawful trade; it has extended to exiles, flying as clouds, the\r\nasylum of our better liberty. It has kept us at rest within our borders;\r\nit has scattered the seeds of liberty, under law and under order,\r\nbroadcast; it has seen and helped American feeling to swell into a\r\nfuller flood; from many a field and many a deck, though it seeks not\r\nwar, makes not war, and fears not war, it has borne the radiant flag,\r\nall unstained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOVE OF COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThere is a love of country which comes uncalled for, one knows not how.\r\nIt comes in with the very air, the eye, the ear, the instinct, the first\r\nbeatings of the heart. The faces of brothers and sisters, and the loved\r\nfather and mother, the laugh of playmates, the old willow tree and well\r\nand school-house, the bees at work in the spring, the note of the robin\r\nat evening, the lullaby, the cows coming home, the singing-book, the\r\nvisits of neighbors, the general training--all things which make\r\nchildhood happy, begin it.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the age of the passions and the age of the reason draw on,\r\nand the love of home, and the sense of security and property under the\r\nlaw come to life, and as the story goes round, and as the book or the\r\nnewspaper relates the less favored lot of other lands, and the public\r\nand private sense of the man is forming and formed, there is a type of\r\npatriotism already. Thus they have imbibed it who stood that charge at\r\nConcord, and they who hung on the deadly retreat, and they who threw up\r\nthe hasty and imperfect redoubt at Bunker Hill by night, set on it the\r\nblood-red provincial flag, and passed so calmly with Prescott and Putnam\r\nand Warren through the experiences of the first fire.\r\n\r\nTo direct this spontaneous sentiment of hearts to our great Union, to\r\nraise it high, to make it broad and deep, to instruct it, to educate it,\r\nis in some things harder, and in some things easier; but it may be, it\r\nmust be, done. Our country has her great names; she has her food for\r\npatriotism, for childhood, and for man.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES STEAMSHIP COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\nAn appropriate addition to the White Squadron of the United States navy\r\nwas launched from the Cramps' ship-yard at Philadelphia, July 26, 1892,\r\nand was most appropriately christened the Columbia. The launch was in\r\nevery way a success, and was witnessed by many thousand people,\r\nincluding Secretary Tracy, Vice-President Morton, and others prominent\r\nin the navy and in public life.\r\n\r\nThis new vessel is designed to be swifter than any other large war\r\nvessel now afloat, and she will have a capacity possessed by no other\r\nwar vessel yet built, in that of being able to steam at a ten-knot speed\r\n26,240 miles, or for 109 days, without recoaling. She also possesses\r\nmany novel features, the principal of which is the application of triple\r\nscrews. She is one of two of the most important ships designed for the\r\nUnited States navy, her sister ship, No. 13, now being built at the same\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the Columbia are: Length on mean load line, 412 feet;\r\nbeam, 58 feet. Her normal draught will be 23 feet; displacement, 7,550\r\ntons; maximum speed, 22 knots an hour; and she will have the enormous\r\nindicated horse-power of 20,000. As to speed, the contractor guarantees\r\nan average speed, in the open sea, under conditions prescribed by the\r\nNavy Department, of twenty-one knots an hour, maintained for four\r\nconsecutive hours, during which period the air-pressure in the fire-room\r\nmust be kept within a prescribed limit. For every quarter of a knot\r\ndeveloped above the required guaranteed speed the contractor is to\r\nreceive a premium of $50,000 over and above the contract price; and for\r\neach quarter of a knot that the vessel may fail of reaching the\r\nguaranteed speed there is to be deducted from the contract price the sum\r\nof $25,000. There seems to be no doubt among the naval experts that she\r\nwill meet the conditions as to speed, and this is a great desideratum,\r\nsince her chief function is to be to sweep the seas of an enemy's\r\ncommerce. To do her work she must be able to overhaul, in an ocean race,\r\nthe swiftest transatlantic passenger steamships afloat.\r\n\r\nThe triple-screw system is a most decided novelty. One of these screws\r\nwill be placed amidships, or on the line of the keel, as in ordinary\r\nsingle-screw vessels, and the two others will be placed about fifteen\r\nfeet farther forward and above, one on each side, as is usual in\r\ntwin-screw vessels. The twin screws will diverge as they leave the hull,\r\ngiving additional room for the uninterrupted motion upon solid water of\r\nall three simultaneously. There is one set of triple expansion engines\r\nfor each screw independently, thus allowing numerous combinations of\r\nmovements. For ordinary cruising the central screw alone will be used,\r\ngiving a speed of about fourteen knots; with the two side-screws alone,\r\na speed of seventeen knots can be maintained, and with all three screws\r\nat work, at full power, a high speed of from twenty to twenty-two knots\r\ncan be got out of the vessel. This arrangement will allow the machinery\r\nto be worked at its most economical number of revolutions at all rates\r\nof the vessel's speed, and each engine can be used independently of the\r\nothers in propelling the vessel. The full steam pressure will be 160\r\npounds. The shafting is made of forged steel, 16-1/2 inches in diameter.\r\nIn fact, steel has been used wherever possible, so as to secure the\r\nlightest, in weight, of machinery. There are ten boilers, six of which\r\nare double-ended--that is, with furnaces in each end--21-1/4 feet long\r\nand 15-1/2 feet in diameter. Two others are 18-1/4 feet long and 11-2/3\r\nfeet in diameter, and the two others, single-ended, are 8 feet long and\r\n10 feet in diameter. Eight of the largest boilers are set in\r\nwatertight compartments.\r\n\r\nIn appearance the Columbia will closely resemble, when ready for sea, an\r\nordinary merchantman, the sides being nearly free from projections or\r\nsponsons, which ordinarily appear on vessels of war. She will have two\r\nsingle masts, but neither of them will have a military top, such as is\r\nnow provided upon ordinary war vessels. This plan of her merchantman\r\nappearance is to enable her to get within range of any vessel she may\r\nwish to encounter before her character or purpose is discovered. The\r\nvitals of the ship will be well protected with armor plating and the gun\r\nstations will be shielded against the firing of machine guns. Her\r\nmachinery, boilers, magazines, etc., are protected by an armored deck\r\nfour inches thick on the slope and 2-1/2 inches thick on the flat. The\r\nspace between this deck and the gun-deck is minutely subdivided with\r\ncoal-bunkers and storerooms, and in addition to these a coffer-dam, five\r\nfeet in width, is worked next to the ship's side for the whole length of\r\nthe vessel. In the bunkers the space between the inner and outer skins\r\nof the vessel will be filled with woodite, thus forming a wall five feet\r\nthick against machine gun fire. This filling can also be utilized as\r\nfuel in an emergency. Forward and abaft of the coal bunkers the\r\ncoffer-dam will be filled with some water-excluding substance similar to\r\nwoodite. In the wake of the four-inch and the machine guns, the ship's\r\nside will be armored with four-inch and two-inch nickel steel plates.\r\n\r\nThe vessel will carry no big guns, for the reason that the uses for\r\nwhich she is intended will not require them. Not a gun will be in sight,\r\nand the battery will be abnormally light. There will be four six-inch\r\nbreech-loading rifles, mounted in the open, and protected with heavy\r\nshields attached to the gun carriages; eight four-inch breech-loading\r\nrifles; twelve six-pounder, and four one-pounder rapid-firing guns; four\r\nmachine or Gatling guns, and six torpedo-launching tubes. Besides these\r\nshe has a ram bow. The Columbia is to be completed, ready for service,\r\nby May 19, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n     ELIZA COOK, a popular English poetess. Born in Southwark, London,\r\n     1817.\r\n\r\n  Land of the West! though passing brief the record of thine age,\r\n  Thou hast a name that darkens all on history's wide page.\r\n  Let all the blasts of fame ring out--thine shall be loudest far;\r\n  Let others boast their satellites--thou hast the planet star.\r\n  Thou hast a name whose characters of light shall ne'er depart;\r\n  'Tis stamped upon the dullest brain, and warms the coldest heart;\r\n  A war-cry fit for any land where freedom's to be won:\r\n  Land of the West! it stands alone--it is thy Washington!\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA THE MONUMENT OF COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n     KINAHAN CORNWALLIS. In \"The Song of America and Columbus,\" 1892.\r\n\r\n  Queen of the Great Republic of the West,\r\n  With shining stars and stripes upon thy breast,\r\n  The emblems of our land of liberty,\r\n  Thou namesake of Columbus--hail to thee!\r\n\r\n   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  No fitter queen could now Columbus crown,\r\n  Or voice to all the world his great renown.\r\n  His fame in thee personified we see--\r\n  The sequel of his grand discovery;\r\n  Yea, here, in thee, his monument behold.\r\n  Whose splendor dims his golden dreams of old.\r\n  And standing by Chicago's inland sea,\r\n  The nations of the earth will vie with thee\r\n  In twining laurel wreaths for him of yore\r\n  Who found the New World in San Salvador.\r\n\r\n   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  COLUMBIA! to Columbus give thy hand.\r\n  And, as ye on a sea of glory stand,\r\n  The world will read anew the story grand\r\n  Of thee, COLUMBIA, and Columbus, too--\r\n  The matchless epic of the Old and New--\r\n  The tale that grows more splendid with the years--\r\n  The pride and wonder of the hemispheres.\r\n  In vast magnificence it stands alone,\r\n  With thee--Columbus greeting--on thy throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN IDEA.\r\n\r\n     The Hon. SHELBY M. CULLOM, U. S. Senator from Illinois. In a speech\r\n     delivered in Chicago, 1892.\r\n\r\nFrom the altitude of now, from this zenith of history, look out upon the\r\nworld. Behold! the American idea is everywhere prominent. The world\r\nitself is preparing to take an American holiday. The wise men, not only\r\nof the Orient, but everywhere, are girding up their loins, and will\r\nfollow the star of empire until it rests above this city of\r\nChicago--this civic Hercules; this miracle of accomplishment; the\r\nthrobbing heart of all the teeming life and activity of our American\r\ncommonwealth. The people of the world are soon to receive an object\r\nlesson in the stupendous kindergarten we are instituting for their\r\nbenefit. Even Chile will be here, and will learn, I trust, something of\r\nChristian forbearance and good-fellowship.\r\n\r\nNow, is it possible that monarchy, plutarchy, or any other archy, can\r\nlong withstand this curriculum of instruction? No! I repeat, the\r\nAmerican idea is everywhere triumphant. England is a monarchy, to be\r\nsure, but only out of compliment to an impotent and aged Queen. The Czar\r\nof Russia clings to his throne. It is a hen-coop in the mäelstrom! The\r\ncrumbling monarchies of the earth are held together only by the force of\r\narms. Standing armies are encamped without each city. The sword and\r\nbayonet threaten and retard, but the seeds of liberty have been caught\r\nup by the winds of heaven and scattered broadcast throughout the earth.\r\nTyranny's doom is sounded! The people's millennium is at hand! And\r\nthis--this, under God, is the mission of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG AMERICA.\r\n\r\n     GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS, a popular American author and lecturer. Born\r\n     at Providence, R. I., February 24, 1824; died at West Brighton,\r\n     Staten Island, N. Y., August 31, 1892.\r\n\r\nI know the flower in your hand fades while you look at it. The dream\r\nthat allures you glimmers and is gone. But flower and dream, like youth\r\nitself, are buds and prophecies. For where, without the perfumed\r\nblossoming of the spring orchards all over the hills and among all the\r\nvalleys of New England and New York, would the happy harvests of New\r\nYork and New England be? And where, without the dreams of the young men\r\nlighting the future with human possibility, would be the deeds of the\r\nold men, dignifying the past with human achievement? How deeply does it\r\nbecome us to believe this, who are not only young ourselves, but living\r\nwith the youth of the youngest nation in history. I congratulate you\r\nthat you are young; I congratulate you that you are Americans. Like you,\r\nthat country is in its flower, not yet in its fruit, and that flower is\r\nsubject to a thousand chances before the fruit is set. Worms may destroy\r\nit, frosts may wither it, fires may blight it, gusts may whirl it away;\r\nbut how gorgeously it still hangs blossoming in the garden of time,\r\nwhile its penetrating perfume floats all round the world, and\r\nintoxicates all other nations with the hope of liberty.\r\n\r\nKnowing that the life of every nation, as of each individual, is a\r\nbattle, let us remember, also, that the battle is to those who fight\r\nwith faith and undespairing devotion. Knowing that nothing is worth\r\nfighting for at all unless God reigns, let us, at least, believe as much\r\nin the goodness of God as we do in the dexterity of the devil. And,\r\nviewing this prodigious spectacle of our country--this hope of humanity,\r\nthis young America, _our_ America--taking the sun full in its front, and\r\nmaking for the future as boldly and blithely as the young David for\r\nGoliath, let us believe with all our hearts, and from that faith shall\r\nspring the fact that David, and not Goliath, is to win the day; and\r\nthat, out of the high-hearted dreams of wise and good men about our\r\ncountry, Time, however invisibly and inscrutably, is, at this moment,\r\nslowly hewing the most colossal and resplendent result in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HIDDEN WORLD.\r\n\r\n     OLIVE E. DANA, an American journalist. In the _New England\r\n     Journal_.\r\n\r\n  The hidden world lies in the hand of God,\r\n  Waiting, like seed, to fall on the sod;\r\n  Tranquil its lakes were, and lovely its shores,\r\n  While idly each stream o'er the fretting rocks pours.\r\n  Its forests are fair and its mines fathomless,\r\n  Grand are its mountains in their loftiness;\r\n  Its fields wait the plow, and its harbors the ships,\r\n  No sail down the blue of the water-way slips.\r\n  God keeps in his palm, through centuries dim,\r\n  This hid, idle seed. It belongeth to him.\r\n  Away in a corner, where God only knows,\r\n  The seed when he plants it quickens and grows.\r\n  The pale buds unfold as the nations pass by,\r\n  The fragrance is grateful, the blooms multiply,\r\n  But it is blossom time, this what we see;\r\n  Who knows what the fullness of harvest will be.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA THE QUEEN OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n     TIMOTHY DWIGHT, an American divine and scholar. Born at\r\n     Northampton, Mass., May 14, 1752; died at New Haven, Conn., January\r\n     11, 1817.\r\n\r\n  Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise,\r\n  The queen of the world and the child of the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DEFINITION OF PATRIOTISM.\r\n\r\n     T. M. EDDY, an eloquent speaker and profound scholar. Born, 1823;\r\n     died, 1874. From an oration delivered on Independence Day.\r\n\r\nPatriotism is the love of country. It has ever been recognized among the\r\ncardinal virtues of true men, and he who was destitute of it has been\r\nconsidered an ingrate. Even among the icy desolations of the far north\r\nwe expect to find, and _do_ find, an ardent affection for the land of\r\nnativity, the home of childhood, youth, and age. There is much in our\r\ncountry to create and foster this sentiment. It is a country of imperial\r\ndimensions, reaching from sea to sea, and almost \"from the rivers to the\r\nends of the earth.\" None of the empires of old could compare with it in\r\nthis regard. It is washed by two great oceans, while its lakes are vast\r\ninland seas. Its rivers are silver lines of beauty and commerce. Its\r\ngrand mountain chains are the links of God's forging and welding,\r\nbinding together North and South, East and West. It is a land of\r\nglorious memories. It was peopled by the picked men of Europe, who came\r\nhither, \"not for wrath, but conscience' sake.\" Said the younger Winthrop\r\nto his father, \"I shall call that my country where I may most glorify\r\nGod and enjoy the presence of my dearest friends.\" And so came godly men\r\nand devoted women, flying from oppressive statutes, where they might\r\nfind\r\n\r\n  Freedom to worship God.\r\n\r\nThere are spots on the sun, and the microscope reveals flaws in\r\nburnished steel, and so there were spots and flaws in the character of\r\nthe early founders of this land; but with them all, our colonial history\r\nis one that stirs the blood and quickens the pulse of him who reads. It\r\nis the land of the free school, the free press, and the free pulpit. It\r\nis impossible to compute the power of this trio. The free schools, open\r\nto rich and poor, bind together the people in educational bonds, and in\r\nthe common memories of the recitation-room and the playground; and how\r\nstrong _they_ are, you, reader, well know, as some past recollection\r\ntugs at your heart-strings. The free press may not always be altogether\r\nas dignified or elevated as the more highly cultivated may desire, but\r\nit is ever open to complaints of the people; is ever watchful of popular\r\nrights and jealous of class encroachments, and the highest in authority\r\nknow that it is above President or Senate. The free pulpit, sustained\r\nnot by legally exacted tithes wrung from an unwilling people, but by the\r\nfree-will offerings of loving supporters, gathers about it the millions,\r\ninculcates the highest morality, points to brighter worlds, and when\r\noccasion demands will not be silent before political wrongs. Its power,\r\nsimply as an educating agency, can scarcely be estimated. In this\r\ncountry its freedom gives a competition so vigorous that it must remain\r\nin direct popular sympathy. How strong it is, the country saw when its\r\nvoice was lifted in the old cry, \"Rebellion is as the sin of\r\nwitchcraft.\" Its words started the slumbering, roused the careless, and\r\ncalled the \"sacramental host,\" as well as the \"men of the world, to\r\narms.\" These three grand agencies are not rival, but supplementary, each\r\ndoing an essential work in public culture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHIP OF COLUMBUS--THE SANTA MARIA CARAVEL.\r\n\r\n(See pages 94, 216, and 282.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA--OPPORTUNITY.\r\n\r\n     RALPH WALDO EMERSON, a noted American essayist, poet, and\r\n     speculative philosopher.

Born at\r\n     Cambridge, Mass., 1801; died, August 26, 1871. From a patriotic\r\n     address delivered in Boston.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Europe are upon us; the monarch, from his throne, watches us\r\nwith an angry countenance; the peasant turns his gaze on us with joyful\r\nfaith; the writers on politics quote our condition as a proof of the\r\npossibility of popular government; the heroes of freedom animate their\r\nfollowers by reminding them of our success. At no moment of the last\r\nhalf century has it been so important that we should send up a clear and\r\nstrong light which may be seen across the Atlantic. An awful charge of\r\nunfaithfulness to the interests of mankind will be recorded against us\r\nif we suffer this light to be obscured by the mingling vapors of passion\r\nand misrule and sin. But not Europe alone will be influenced by the\r\ncharacter we give to our destiny. The republics of the South have no\r\nother guide toward the establishment of order and freedom than our\r\nexample. If this should fail them, the last stay would be torn from\r\ntheir hope. We are placed under a most solemn obligation, to keep before\r\nthem this motive to perseverance in their endeavors to place free\r\ninstitutions on a sure basis. Shall we leave those wide regions to\r\ndespair and anarchy? Better that they had patiently borne a foreign\r\nyoke, though it bowed their necks to the ground.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the United States, it has been said of us, with truth, that\r\nwe are at the head of the popular party of the world. Shall we be\r\nashamed of so glorious a rank? or shall we basely desert our place and\r\nthrow away our distinction? Forbid it! self-respect, patriotism,\r\nphilanthropy. Christians, we believe that God has made us a name and a\r\npraise among the nations. We believe that our religion yields its best\r\nfruit in a free land. Shall we be regardless of our duty as creatures of\r\nthe Divine Power and recipients of His goodness? Shall we be indifferent\r\nto the effects which our religion may work in the world? Forbid it! our\r\ngratitude, our faith, our piety. In one way only can we discharge our\r\nduty to the rest of mankind--by the purity and elevation of character\r\nthat shall distinguish us as a people. If we sink into luxury, vice, or\r\nmoral apathy, our brightness will be lost, our prosperity deprived of\r\nits vital element, and we shall appear disgraced before man, guilty\r\nbefore God.\r\n\r\n\r\nATLANTIC AND PACIFIC.\r\n\r\n     JAMES A. GARFIELD, American general and statesman; twentieth\r\n     President of the United States. Born in Orange, Ohio, November 19,\r\n     1831; shot by an assassin, July 2, 1881; died, September 19 in the\r\n     same year, at Long Branch, New Jersey. From \"Garfield's Words.\" By\r\n     permission of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Publishers.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic is still the great historic sea. Even in its sunken wrecks\r\nmight be read the record of modern nations. Who shall say that the\r\nPacific will not yet become the great historic sea of the future--the\r\nvast amphitheater around which shall sit in majesty and power the two\r\nAmericas, Asia, Africa, and the chief colonies of Europe. God forbid\r\nthat the waters of our national life should ever settle to the dead\r\nlevel of a waveless calm. It would be the stagnation of death, the ocean\r\ngrave of individual liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREATEST CONTINUOUS EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n     The Right Hon. WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE, the noted English statesman\r\n     and orator. Born at Liverpool, December 29, 1809. From his \"Kin\r\n     beyond the Sea.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no parallel in all the records of the world to the case of that\r\nprolific British mother who has sent forth her innumerable children over\r\nall the earth to be the founders of half-a-dozen empires. She, with her\r\nprogeny, may almost claim to constitute a kind of universal church in\r\npolitics. But among these children there is one whose place in the\r\nworld's eye and in history is superlative; it is the American Republic.\r\nShe is the eldest born. She has, taking the capacity of her land into\r\nview as well as its mere measurement, a natural base for the greatest\r\ncontinuous empire ever established by man. And it may be well here to\r\nmention what has not always been sufficiently observed, that the\r\ndistinction between continuous empire, and empire severed and dispersed\r\nover sea is vital. The development which the Republic has effected has\r\nbeen unexampled in its rapidity and force. While other countries have\r\ndoubled, or at most trebled, their population, she has risen during one\r\nsingle century of freedom, in round numbers, from two millions to\r\nforty-five. As to riches, it is reasonable to establish, from the\r\ndecennial stages of the progress thus far achieved, a series for the\r\nfuture; and, reckoning upon this basis, I suppose that the very next\r\ncensus, in the year 1880, will exhibit her to the world as certainly the\r\nwealthiest of all the nations. The huge figure of a thousand millions\r\nsterling, which may be taken roundly as the annual income of the United\r\nKingdom, has been reached at a surprising rate; a rate which may perhaps\r\nbe best expressed by saying that, if we could have started forty or\r\nfifty years ago from zero, at the rate of our recent annual increment,\r\nwe should now have reached our present position. But while we have been\r\nadvancing with this portentous rapidity, America is passing us by as if\r\nin a canter. Yet even now the work of searching the soil and the bowels\r\nof the territory, and opening out her enterprise throughout its vast\r\nexpanse, is in its infancy. The England and the America of the present\r\nare probably the two strongest nations of the world. But there can\r\nhardly be a doubt, as between the America and the England of the future,\r\nthat the daughter, at some no very distant time, will, whether fairer or\r\nless fair, be unquestionably yet stronger than the mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPICAL AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n     HENRY W. GRADY, the late brilliant editor of the Atlanta\r\n     _Constitution_. From an address delivered at the famous New England\r\n     dinner in New York.\r\n\r\nWith the Cavalier once established as a fact in your charming little\r\nbooks, I shall let him work out his own stratum, as he has always done,\r\nwith engaging gallantry, and we will hold no controversy as to his\r\nmerits. Why should we? Neither Puritan nor Cavalier long survived as\r\nsuch. The virtues and traditions of both happily still live for the\r\ninspiration of their sons and the saving of the old fashion. But both\r\nPuritan and Cavalier were lost in the storm of their first revolution,\r\nand the American citizen, supplanting both, and stronger than either,\r\ntook possession of the republic bought by their common blood and\r\nfashioned to wisdom, and charged himself with teaching men government\r\nand establishing the voice of the people as the voice of God. Great\r\ntypes, like valuable plants, are slow to flower and fruit. But from the\r\nunion of these colonists, from the straightening of their purposes and\r\nthe crossing of their blood, slow perfecting through a century, came he\r\nwho stands as the first typical American, the first who comprehended\r\nwithin himself all the strength and gentleness, all the majesty and\r\ngrace of this Republic--Abraham Lincoln. He was the sum of Puritan and\r\nCavalier, for in his ardent nature were fused the virtues of both, and\r\nin the depths of his great soul the faults of both were lost. He was\r\ngreater than Puritan, greater than Cavalier, in that he was American,\r\nand that in his homely form were first gathered the vast and thrilling\r\nforces of this ideal government--charging it with such tremendous\r\nmeaning and so elevating it above human suffering that martyrdom, though\r\ninfamously aimed, came as a fitting crown to a life consecrated from the\r\ncradle to human liberty. Let us, each cherishing his traditions and\r\nhonoring his fathers, build with reverent hands to the type of this\r\nsimple but sublime life, in which all types are honored, and in the\r\ncommon glory we shall win as Americans there will be plenty and to spare\r\nfor your forefathers and for mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRATITUDE AND PRIDE.\r\n\r\n     BENJAMIN HARRISON, American soldier, lawyer, and statesman. Born at\r\n     North Bend, Ohio, August 20, 1833. Grandson of General William\r\n     Henry Harrison, ninth President of the United States, and himself\r\n     President, 1888-1892. From a speech at Sacramento, Cal., 1891.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: This fresh, delightful morning, this vast assemblage of\r\ncontented and happy people, this building, dedicated to the uses of\r\ncivil government--all things about us tend to inspire our hearts with\r\npride and with gratitude. Gratitude to that overruling Providence that\r\nturned hither, after the discovery of this continent, the steps of those\r\nwho had the capacity to organize a free representative government.\r\nGratitude to that Providence that has increased the feeble colonies on\r\nan inhospitable coast to these millions of prosperous people, who have\r\nfound another sea and populated its sunny shores with a happy and\r\ngrowing people.\r\n\r\nGratitude to that Providence that led us through civil strife to a glory\r\nand a perfection of unity as a people that was otherwise impossible.\r\nGratitude that we have to-day a Union of free States without a slave to\r\nstand as a reproach to that immortal declaration upon which our\r\nGovernment rests.\r\n\r\nPride that our people have achieved so much; that, triumphing over all\r\nthe hardships of those early pioneers, who struggled in the face of\r\ndiscouragement and difficulties more appalling than those that met\r\nColumbus when he turned the prows of his little vessels toward an\r\nunknown shore; that, triumphing over perils of starvation, perils of\r\nsavages, perils of sickness, here on the sunny slope of the Pacific they\r\nhave established civil institutions and set up the banner of the\r\nimperishable Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE SUPERIOR.\r\n\r\n     Sir FRANCIS BOND HEAD, a popular English writer. Born near\r\n     Rochester, Kent, January 1, 1893. Lieutenant-general of Upper\r\n     Canada 1836-1838. Died, July 20, 1875.\r\n\r\nIn both the northern and southern hemispheres of the New World, nature\r\nhas not only outlined her works on a larger scale, but has painted the\r\nwhole picture with brighter and more costly colors than she used in\r\ndelineating and in beautifying the Old World. The heavens of America\r\nappear infinitely higher, the sky is bluer, the air is fresher, the cold\r\nis intenser, the moon looks larger, the stars are brighter, the thunder\r\nis louder, the lightning is vivider, the wind is stronger, the rain is\r\nheavier, the mountains are higher, the rivers longer, the forests\r\nbigger, the plains broader.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA'S WELCOME.\r\n\r\n     PATRICK HENRY, a celebrated American orator and patriot. Born at\r\n     Studley, Hanover County, Virginia, May 29, 1736; died, June 6,\r\n     1799. The author of the celebrated phrase, \"Give me liberty or give\r\n     me death,\" in speaking in the Virginia Convention, March, 1775.\r\n\r\nCast your eyes over this extensive country; observe the salubrity of\r\nyour climate, the variety and fertility of your soil, and see that soil\r\nintersected in every quarter by bold, navigable streams, flowing to the\r\neast and to the west, as if the finger of Heaven were marking out the\r\ncourse of your settlements, inviting you to enterprise, and pointing the\r\nway to wealth. You are destined, at some time or other, to become a\r\ngreat agricultural and commercial people; the only question is, whether\r\nyou choose to reach this point by slow gradations, and at some distant\r\nperiod; lingering on through a long and sickly minority; subjected,\r\nmeanwhile, to the machinations, insults, and oppressions, of enemies,\r\nforeign and domestic, without sufficient strength to resist and chastise\r\nthem; or whether you choose rather to rush at once, as it were, to the\r\nfull enjoyment of those high destinies, and be able to cope,\r\nsingle-handed, with the proudest oppressor of the Old World. If you\r\nprefer the latter course, as I trust you do, encourage immigration;\r\nencourage the husbandmen, the mechanics, the merchants, of the Old World\r\nto come and settle in this land of promise; make it the home of the\r\nskillful, the industrious, the fortunate, and happy, as well as the\r\nasylum of the distressed; fill up the measure of your population as\r\nspeedily as you can, by the means which Heaven hath placed in your\r\npower; and I venture to prophesy there are those now living who will see\r\nthis favored land amongst the most powerful on earth; able to take care\r\nof herself, without resorting to that policy, which is always so\r\ndangerous, though sometimes unavoidable, of calling in foreign aid. Yes,\r\nthey will see her great in arts and in arms; her golden harvests waving\r\nover fields of immeasurable extent; her commerce penetrating the most\r\ndistant seas, and her cannon silencing the vain boasts of those who now\r\nproudly affect to rule the waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Niña. Santa Maria. Pinta.\r\n\r\nTHE FLEET OF COLUMBUS (See pages 216 and 282.)]\r\n\r\nBut you must have _men_; you can not get along without them; those heavy\r\nforests of valuable timber, under which your lands are growing, must be\r\ncleared away; those vast riches which cover the face of your soil, as\r\nwell as those which lie hid in its bosom, are to be developed and\r\ngathered only by the skill and enterprise of men. Do you ask how you are\r\nto get them? Open your doors, and they will come in; the population of\r\nthe Old World is full to overflowing; that population is ground, too, by\r\nthe oppressions of the governments under which they live. They are\r\nalready standing on tiptoe upon their native shores, and looking to your\r\ncoasts with a wishful and longing eye; they see here a land blessed\r\nwith natural and political advantages which are not equaled by those of\r\nany other country upon earth; a land on which a gracious Providence hath\r\nemptied the horn of abundance; a land over which peace hath now\r\nstretched forth her white wings, and where content and plenty lie down\r\nat every door. They see something still more attractive than all this;\r\nthey see a land in which liberty hath taken up her abode; that liberty\r\nwhom they had considered as a fabled goddess, existing only in the\r\nfancies of poets; they see her here a real divinity, her altars rising\r\non every hand throughout these happy States, her glories chanted by\r\nthree millions of tongues, and the whole region smiling under her\r\nblessed influence. Let but this our celestial goddess, Liberty, stretch\r\nforth her fair hand toward the people of the Old World, tell them to\r\ncome, and bid them welcome, and you will see them pouring in from the\r\nnorth, from the south, from the east, and from the west; your\r\nwildernesses will be cleared and settled, your deserts will smile, your\r\nranks will be filled, and you will soon be in a condition to defy the\r\npowers of any adversary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR GREAT TRUST.\r\n\r\n     GEORGE STILLMAN HILLARD, an eminent American writer, lawyer, and\r\n     orator. Born at Machias, Maine, 1808; died, 1879. From an\r\n     Independence Day oration.\r\n\r\nOur Rome can not fall, and we be innocent. No conqueror will chain us to\r\nthe car of his triumph; no countless swarm of Huns and Goths will bury\r\nthe memorials and trophies of civilized life beneath a living tide of\r\nbarbarism. Our own selfishness, our own neglect, our own passions, and\r\nour own vices will furnish the elements of our destruction. With our own\r\nhands we shall tear down the stately edifice of our glory. We shall die\r\nby self-inflicted wounds.\r\n\r\nBut we will not talk of themes like these. We will not think of failure,\r\ndishonor, and despair. We will elevate our minds to the contemplation of\r\nour high duties and the great trust committed to us. We will resolve to\r\nlay the foundations of our prosperity on that rock of private virtue\r\nwhich can not be shaken until the laws of the moral world are reversed.\r\nFrom our own breasts shall flow the salient springs of national\r\nincrease. Then our success, our happiness, our glory, will be as\r\ninevitable as the inferences of mathematics. We may calmly smile at all\r\nthe croakings of all the ravens, whether of native or foreign breed.\r\n\r\nThe whole will not grow weak by the increase of its parts. Our growth\r\nwill be like that of the mountain oak, which strikes its roots more\r\ndeeply into the soil, and clings to it with a closer grasp, as its lofty\r\nhead is exalted and its broad arms stretched out. The loud burst of joy\r\nand gratitude which, on this, the anniversary of our independence, is\r\nbreaking from the full hearts of a mighty people, will never cease to be\r\nheard. No chasms of sullen silence will interrupt its course; no\r\ndiscordant notes of sectional madness mar the general harmony. Year\r\nafter year will increase it by tributes from now unpeopled solitudes.\r\nThe farthest West shall hear it and rejoice; the Oregon shall swell it\r\nwith the voice of its waters; the Rocky Mountains shall fling back the\r\nglad sound from their snowy crests.\r\n\r\n\r\nON FREEDOM'S GENEROUS SOIL.\r\n\r\n     OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, M. D., the distinguished American author,\r\n     wit, and poet. Born in Cambridge, Mass., August 29, 1809.\r\n\r\nAmerica is the only place where man is full-grown.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL HERITAGE.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. THOMAS STARR KING, an American Unitarian divine. Born in\r\n     New York in 1824; died, 1864. From an address on the \"Privileges\r\n     and Duties of Patriotism,\" delivered in November, 1862. By\r\n     permission of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Publishers, Boston.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the continent could turn toward you to-morrow at sunrise,\r\nand show to you the whole American area in the short hours of the sun's\r\nadvance from Eastport to the Pacific. You would see New England roll\r\ninto light from the green plumes of Aroostook to the silver stripe of\r\nthe Hudson; westward thence over the Empire State, and over the lakes,\r\nand over the sweet valleys of Pennsylvania, and over the prairies, the\r\nmorning blush would run and would waken all the line of the Mississippi;\r\nfrom the frosts where it rises to the fervid waters in which it pours,\r\nfor 3,000 miles it would be visible, fed by rivers that flow from every\r\nmile of the Alleghany slope, and edged by the green embroideries of the\r\ntemperate and tropic zones; beyond this line another basin, too--the\r\nMissouri--catching the morning, leads your eye along its western slope\r\ntill the Rocky Mountains burst upon the vision, and yet do not bar it;\r\nacross its passes we must follow, as the stubborn courage of American\r\npioneers has forced its way, till again the Sierras and their silver\r\nveins are tinted along the mighty bulwark with the break of day; and\r\nthen over to the gold fields of the western slope, and the fatness of\r\nthe California soil, and the beautiful valleys of Oregon, and the\r\nstately forests of Washington, the eye is drawn, as the globe turns out\r\nof the night shadow; and when the Pacific waves are crested with\r\nradiance, you have the one blending picture--nay, the reality--of the\r\nAmerican domain. No such soil--so varied by climate, by products, by\r\nmineral riches, by forest and lake, by wild heights and buttresses, and\r\nby opulent plains, yet all bound into unity of configuration and\r\nbordered by both warm and icy seas--no such domain, was ever given to\r\none people.\r\n\r\nAnd then suppose that you could see in a picture as vast and vivid the\r\npreparation for our inheritance of this land. Columbus, haunted by his\r\nround idea, and setting sail in a sloop, to see Europe sink behind him,\r\nwhile he was serene in the faith of his dream; the later navigators of\r\nevery prominent Christian race who explored the upper coasts; the\r\nMayflower, with her cargo of sifted acorns from the hardy stock of\r\nBritish puritanism, and the ship, whose name we know not, that bore to\r\nVirginia the ancestors of Washington; the clearing of the wilderness,\r\nand the dotting of its clearings with the proofs of manly wisdom and\r\nChristian trust; then the gradual interblending of effort and interest\r\nand sympathy into one life--the congress of the whole Atlantic slope--to\r\nresist oppression upon one member; the rally of every State around\r\nWashington and his holy sword, and again the nobler rally around him\r\nwhen he signed the Constitution, and after that the organization of the\r\nfarthest West with North and South, into one polity and communion; when\r\nthis was finished, the tremendous energy of free life, under the\r\nstimulus and with the aid of advancing science, in increasing wealth,\r\nsubduing the wilds to the bonds of use, multiplying fertile fields and\r\nbusy schools and noble work-shops and churches, hallowed by free-will\r\nofferings of prayer; and happy homes, and domes dedicated to the laws of\r\nStates that rise by magic from the haunts of the buffalo and deer, all\r\nin less than a long lifetime; and if we could see also how, in achieving\r\nthis, the flag which represents all this history is dyed in traditions\r\nof exploits, by land and sea, that have given heroes to American annals\r\nwhose names are potent to conjure with, while the world's list of\r\nthinkers in matter is crowded with the names of American inventors, and\r\nthe higher rolls of literary merit are not empty of the title of our\r\n\"representative men\"; if all that the past has done for us, and the\r\npresent reveals, could thus stand apparent in one picture, and then if\r\nthe promise of the future to the children of our millions under our\r\ncommon law, and with continental peace, could be caught in one vast\r\nspectral exhibition--the wealth in store, the power, the privilege, the\r\nfreedom, the learning, the expansive and varied and mighty unity in\r\nfellowship, almost fulfilling the poet's dream of \"the parliament of\r\nman, the federation of the world\"--you would exclaim with exultation,\r\n\"I, too, am an American!\" You would feel that patriotism, next to your\r\ntie to the Divine Love, is the greatest privilege of your life; and you\r\nwould devote yourselves, out of inspiration and joy, to the obligations\r\nof patriotism, that this land, so spread, so adorned, so colonized, so\r\nblessed, should be kept forever against all the assaults of traitors,\r\none in polity, in spirit, and in aim.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIFTED WHEAT.\r\n\r\n     HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW. From his \"Courtship of Miles Standish,\"\r\n     IV.\r\n\r\nGod hath sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTER OF CIVILIZATION.\r\n\r\n     From _North British Review_.\r\n\r\nIt is too late to disparage America. Accustomed to look with wonder on\r\nthe civilization of the past, upon the unblest glories of Greece and of\r\nRome, upon mighty empires that have risen but to fall, the English mind\r\nhas never fixed itself on the grand phenomenon of a great nation at\r\nschool. Viewing America as a forward child that has deserted its home\r\nand abjured its parent, we have ever looked upon her with a callous\r\nheart and with an evil eye, judicially blind to her progress.\r\n\r\nBut how she has gone on developing the resources of a region teeming\r\nwith vegetable life. How she has intrenched herself amid noble\r\ninstitutions, with temples enshrined in religious toleration, with\r\nuniversities of private bequest and public organization, with national\r\nand unshackled schools, and with all the improvements which science,\r\nliterature, and philanthropy demand from the citizen or from the state.\r\n\r\nSupplied from the Old World with its superabundant life, the Anglo-Saxon\r\ntide has been carrying its multiplied population to the West, rushing\r\nonward through impervious forests, leveling their lofty pines and\r\nconverting the wilderness into abodes of populous plenty, intelligence,\r\nand taste. Nor is this living flood the destroying scourge which\r\nProvidence sometimes lets loose upon our species. It breathes in accents\r\nwhich are our own; it is instinct with English life; and it bears on its\r\nsnowy crest the auroral light of the East, to gild the darkness of the\r\nWest with the purple radiance of salvation, of knowledge, and of peace.\r\n\r\nHer empire of coal, her kingdom of cotton and of corn, her regions of\r\ngold and of iron, mark out America as the center of civilization, as the\r\nemporium of the world's commerce, as the granary and storehouse out of\r\nwhich the kingdoms of the East will be clothed and fed; and, we greatly\r\nfear, as the asylum in which our children will take refuge when the\r\nhordes of Asia and the semi-barbarians of Eastern Europe shall again\r\ndarken and desolate the West.\r\n\r\nThough dauntless in her mien, and colossal in her strength, she displays\r\nupon her banner the star of peace, shedding its radiance upon us. Let us\r\nreciprocate the celestial light, and, strong and peaceful ourselves, we\r\nshall have nothing to fear from her power, but everything to learn from\r\nher example.\r\n\r\n\r\nA YOUTHFUL LAND.\r\n\r\n     JAMES OTIS, a celebrated American orator and patriot. Born at West\r\n     Barnstable, Mass., February 5, 1725. Killed by lightning at\r\n     Andover, Mass., May, 1783.\r\n\r\nEngland may as well dam up the waters of the Nile with bulrushes as to\r\nfetter the step of Freedom, more proud and firm in this youthful land\r\nthan where she treads the sequestered glens of Scotland or couches\r\nherself among the magnificent mountains of Switzerland. We plunged into\r\nthe wave with the great charter of freedom in our teeth because the\r\nfaggot and torch were behind us. We have waked this new world from its\r\nsavage lethargy; forests have been prostrated in our path, towns and\r\ncities have grown up suddenly as the flowers of the tropics, and the\r\nfires in our autumnal woods are scarcely more rapid than the increase of\r\nour wealth and population.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMBIAN CHORUS.\r\n\r\nProf. John Knowles Paine of Harvard University has completed the music\r\nof his Columbian march and chorus, to be performed on the occasion of\r\nthe dedication of the Exposition buildings, October 21, 1892, to write\r\nwhich he was especially commissioned by the Exposition management. Prof.\r\nPaine has provided these original words for the choral ending of his\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n  All hail and welcome, nations of the earth!\r\n    Columbia's greeting comes from every State.\r\n  Proclaim to all mankind the world's new birth\r\n    Of freedom, age on age shall consecrate.\r\n  Let war and enmity forever cease,\r\n    Let glorious art and commerce banish wrong;\r\n  The universal brotherhood of peace\r\n    Shall be Columbia's high inspiring song.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LANDING OF COLUMBUS.

(See\r\npage 310.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOVEREIGN OF THE ASCENDANT.\r\n\r\n     CHARLES PHILLIPS, an Irish barrister. Born at Sligo, about 1788. He\r\n     practiced with success in criminal cases in London, and gained a\r\n     wide reputation by his speeches, the style of which is rather\r\n     florid. He was for many years a commissioner of the insolvent\r\n     debtors' court in London. Died in 1859.\r\n\r\nSearch creation round, where can you find a country that presents so\r\nsublime a view, so interesting an anticipation? Who shall say for what\r\npurpose mysterious Providence may not have designed her? Who shall say\r\nthat when in its follies, or its crimes, the Old World may have buried\r\nall the pride of its power, and all the pomp of its civilization, human\r\nnature may not find its destined renovation in the New! When its temples\r\nand its trophies shall have moldered into dust; when the glories of its\r\nname shall be but the legend of tradition, and the light of its\r\nachievements live only in song, philosophy will revive again in the sky\r\nof her Franklin, and glory rekindle at the urn of her Washington.\r\n\r\nIs this the vision of romantic fancy? Is it even improbable? I appeal to\r\nHistory! Tell me, thou reverend chronicler of the grave, can all the\r\nillusions of ambition realized, can all the wealth of a universal\r\ncommerce, can all the achievements of successful heroism, or all the\r\nestablishments of this world's wisdom secure to empire the permanency of\r\nits possessions? Alas, Troy thought so once; yet the land of Priam lives\r\nonly in song. Thebes thought so once; yet her hundred gates have\r\ncrumbled, and her very tombs are but as the dust they were vainly\r\nintended to commemorate. So thought Palmyra; where is she? So thought\r\nthe countries of Demosthenes and the Spartan; yet Leonidas is trampled\r\nby the timid slave, and Athens insulted by the servile, mindless, and\r\nenervate Ottoman. In his hurried march, Time has but looked at their\r\nimagined immortality, and all its vanities, from the palace to the tomb,\r\nhave, with their ruins, erased the very impression of his footsteps.\r\nThe days of their glory are as if they had never been; and the island\r\nthat was then a speck, rude and neglected, in the barren ocean, now\r\nrivals the ubiquity of their commerce, the glory of their arms, the fame\r\nof their philosophy, the eloquence of their senate, and the inspiration\r\nof their bards. Who shall say, then, contemplating the past, that\r\nEngland, proud and potent as she appears, may not one day be what Athens\r\nis, and the young America yet soar to be what Athens was. Who shall say,\r\nwhen the European column shall have moldered, and the night of barbarism\r\nobscured its very ruins, that that mighty continent may not emerge from\r\nthe horizon, to rule, for its time, sovereign of the ascendant.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND OF LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n     WENDELL PHILLIPS, \"the silver-tongued orator of America,\" and\r\n     anti-slavery reformer. Born in Boston, Mass., November 29, 1811;\r\n     died, February 2, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe Carpathian Mountains may shelter tyrants. The slopes of Germany may\r\nbear up a race more familiar with the Greek text than the Greek phalanx.\r\nFor aught I know, the wave of Russian rule may sweep so far westward as\r\nto fill once more with miniature despots the robber castles of the\r\nRhine. But of this I am sure: God piled the Rocky Mountains as the\r\nramparts of freedom. He scooped the Valley of the Mississippi as the\r\ncradle of free States. He poured Niagara as the anthem of free men.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHIP COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\n     EDWARD G. PORTER. In an article entitled \"The Ship Columbia and the\r\n     Discovery of Oregon,\" in the _New England Magazine_, June, 1892.\r\n\r\nFew ships, if any, in our merchant marine, since the organization of\r\nthe republic, have acquired such distinction as the Columbia.\r\n\r\nBy two noteworthy achievements, 100 years ago, she attracted the\r\nattention of the commercial world and rendered a service to the United\r\nStates unparalleled in our history. _She was the first American vessel\r\nto carry the stars and stripes around the globe; and, by her discovery\r\nof \"the great river of the West\" to which her name was given, she\r\nfurnished us with the title to our possession_ of that magnificent\r\ndomain which to-day is represented by the flourishing young States of\r\nOregon, Washington, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nThe famous ship was well-known and much talked about at the time, but\r\nher records have mostly disappeared, and there is very little knowledge\r\nat present concerning her.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA'S EMBLEM.\r\n\r\n     EDNA DEAN PROCTOR.

From his \"Emigrant's Song.\"[60]\r\n\r\nLeave the tears to the maiden, the fears to the child, While the future\r\nstands beckoning afar in the wild; For there Freedom, more fair, walks\r\nthe primeval land, Where the wild deer all court the caress of her hand.\r\nThere the deep forests fall, and the old shadows fly, And the palace and\r\ntemple leap into the sky. Oh, the East holds no place where the onward\r\ncan rest, And alone there is room in the land of the West!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMITIVE PITCH.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. MYRON W. REED, a distinguished American clergyman of\r\n     Denver, Colo. From an address delivered in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe best thing we can do for the world is to take care of America. Keep\r\nour country up to the primitive pitch. In front of my old home, in\r\nanother city, is the largest elm in the county. It never talked, it\r\nnever went about doing good. It stood there and made shade for an acre\r\nof children, and a shelter for all the birds that came. It stood there\r\nand preached strength in the air by wide-flung branches, and strength in\r\nthe earth by as many and as long roots as limbs. It stood, one fearful\r\nnight, the charge of a cyclone, and was serene in the March morning. It\r\nproclaimed what an elm could be. It set tree-planters to planting elms.\r\nSo America preaches, man capable of self-government; preaches over the\r\nsea, a republic is safer than any kingdom. Men have outgrown kings. We\r\nshall remember Walt Whitman, if only for a line, \"O America! we build\r\nfor you because you build for the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM HENRY SEWARD, an eminent American statesman. Born at\r\n     Florida, Orange County, N. Y., May 16, 1801; died at Auburn, N. Y.,\r\n     October 10, 1872.\r\n\r\nA kind of reverence is paid by all nations to antiquity. There is no one\r\nthat does not trace its lineage from the gods, or from those who were\r\nespecially favored by the gods. Every people has had its age of gold, or\r\nAugustine age, or historic age--an age, alas! forever passed. These\r\nprejudices are not altogether unwholesome. Although they produce a\r\nconviction of declining virtue, which is unfavorable to generous\r\nemulation, yet a people at once ignorant and irreverential would\r\nnecessarily become licentious. Nevertheless, such prejudices ought to be\r\nmodified. It is untrue that in the period of a nation's rise from\r\ndisorder to refinement it is not able to continually surpass itself. We\r\nsee the _present_, plainly, distinctly, with all its coarse outlines,\r\nits rough inequalities, its dark blots, and its glaring deformities. We\r\nhear all its tumultuous sounds and jarring discords. We see and hear the\r\n_past_ through a distance which reduces all its inequalities to a plane,\r\nmellows all its shades into a pleasing hue, and subdues even its\r\nhoarsest voices into harmony. In our own case, the prejudice is less\r\nerroneous than in most others. The Revolutionary age was truly a heroic\r\none. Its exigencies called forth the genius, and the talents, and the\r\nvirtues of society, and they ripened amid the hardships of a long and\r\nsevere trial. But there were selfishness and vice and factions then as\r\nnow, although comparatively subdued and repressed. You have only to\r\nconsult impartial history to learn that neither public faith, nor public\r\nloyalty, nor private virtue, culminated at that period in our own\r\ncountry; while a mere glance at the literature, or at the stage, or at\r\nthe politics of any European country, in any previous age, reveals the\r\nfact that it was marked, more distinctly than the present, by\r\nlicentious morals and mean ambition. It is only just to infer in favor\r\nof the United States an improvement of morals from their established\r\nprogress in knowledge and power; otherwise, the philosophy of society is\r\nmisunderstood, and we must change all our courses, and henceforth seek\r\nsafety in imbecility, and virtue in superstition and ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPHETIC UTTERANCE OF COLONIAL DAYS.\r\n\r\n     SAMUEL SEWELL. Born at Bishopstoke, Hampshire, England, March,\r\n     1652. Died at Boston, Mass., January, 1730.\r\n\r\nLift up your heads, O ye Gates of Columbia, and be ye lift up, ye\r\nEverlasting Doors, and the King of Glory shall come in.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH STORY, a distinguished American jurist. Born in Marblehead,\r\n     Mass., September 18, 1779; died at Cambridge, Mass., September 10,\r\n     1845. By permission of Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., Publishers.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on what has been, and is, how is it possible not to feel\r\na profound sense of the responsibilities of this Republic to all future\r\nages? What vast motives press upon us for lofty efforts! What brilliant\r\nprospects invite our enthusiasm! What solemn warnings at once demand our\r\nvigilance and moderate our confidence! We stand, the latest, and, if we\r\nfail, probably the last, experiment of self-government by the people. We\r\nhave begun it under circumstances of the most auspicious nature. We are\r\nin the vigor of youth. Our growth has never been checked by the\r\noppressions of tyranny. Our constitutions have never been enfeebled by\r\nthe vices or luxuries of the Old World. Such as we are, we have been\r\nfrom the beginning--simple, hardy, intelligent, accustomed to\r\nself-government and self-respect. The Atlantic rolls between us and any\r\nformidable foe. Within our own territory, stretching through many\r\ndegrees of latitude and longitude, we have the choice of many products\r\nand many means of independence. The government is mild. The press is\r\nfree. Religion is free. Knowledge reaches, or may reach, every home.\r\nWhat fairer prospect of success could be presented? What means more\r\nadequate to accomplish the sublime end? What more is necessary than for\r\nthe people to preserve what they themselves have created? Already has\r\nthe age caught the spirit of our institutions. It has already ascended\r\nthe Andes, and snuffed the breezes of both oceans. It has infused itself\r\ninto the life-blood of Europe, and warmed the sunny plains of France and\r\nthe lowlands of Holland. It has touched the philosophy of Germany and\r\nthe north, and, moving to the south, has opened to Greece the lessons of\r\nher better days.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ELECT NATION.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM STOUGHTON. From an election sermon at Boston, Mass., April\r\n     29, 1669.\r\n\r\nGod sifted a whole nation that he might send choice grain over into this\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAME \"AMERICA.\"\r\n\r\n     MOSES F. SWEETSER, an American _littérateur_. Born in\r\n     Massachusetts, 1848. From his \"Hand-book of the United States.\"[61]\r\n\r\nThe name America comes from _amalric_, or _emmerich_, an old German word\r\nspread through Europe by the Goths, and softened in Latin to Americus,\r\nand in Italian to Amerigo. It was first applied to Brazil. Americus\r\nVespucius, the son of a wealthy Florentine notary, made several voyages\r\nto the New World, a few years later than Columbus, and gave spirited\r\naccounts of his discoveries. About the year 1507, Hylacomylus, of the\r\ncollege at St. Dié, in the Vosges Mountains, brought out a book on\r\ncosmography, in which he said, \"Now, truly, as these regions are more\r\nwidely explored, and another fourth part is discovered, by Americus\r\nVespucius, I see no reason why it should not be justly called\r\n_Amerigen_; that is, the land of Americus, or America, from Americus,\r\nits discoverer, a man of a subtle intellect.\" Hylacomylus invented the\r\nname America, and, as there was no other title for the New World, this\r\ncame gradually into general use. It does not appear that Vespucius was a\r\nparty to this almost accidental transaction, which has made him a\r\nmonument of a hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMBINE AS THE EXPOSITION FLOWER.\r\n\r\n     T. T. SWINBURNE, the poet, has written to J. M. Samuels, chief of\r\n     the Department of Horticulture at the World's Columbian Exposition,\r\n     proposing the columbine as the Columbian Exposition and national\r\n     flower. He gives as reasons:\r\n\r\nIt is most appropriate in name, color, and form. Its name is suggestive\r\nof Columbia, and our country is often called by that name. Its botanical\r\nname, _aquilegia_, is derived from _aquila_ (eagle), on account of the\r\nspur of the petals resembling the talons, and the blade, the beak, of\r\nthe eagle, our national bird. Its colors are red, white, and blue, our\r\nnational colors. The corolla is divided into five points resembling the\r\nstar used to represent our States on our flag; its form also represents\r\nthe Phrygian cap of liberty, and it is an exact copy of the horn of\r\nplenty, the symbol of the Columbian Exposition. The flowers cluster\r\naround a central stem, as our States around the central government.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF '76.\r\n\r\n     BAYARD TAYLOR, the distinguished American traveler, writer, and\r\n     poet. Born in Chester County, Pennsylvania, in 1835; died at\r\n     Berlin, December 19, 1878. From his \"Song of '76.\" By permission of\r\n     Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Publishers, Boston.\r\n\r\n  Waken, voice of the land's devotion!\r\n    Spirit of freedom, awaken all!\r\n  Ring, ye shores, to the song of ocean,\r\n    Rivers answer, and mountains call!\r\n        The golden day has come;\r\n        Let every tongue be dumb\r\n  That sounded its malice or murmured its fears;\r\n        She hath won her story;\r\n        She wears her glory;\r\n  We crown her the Land of a Hundred Years!\r\n\r\n  Out of darkness and toil and danger\r\n    Into the light of victory's day,\r\n  Help to the weak, and home to the stranger,\r\n    Freedom to all, she hath held her way!\r\n        Now Europe's orphans rest\r\n        Upon her mother-breast.\r\n  The voices of nations are heard in the cheers\r\n        That shall cast upon her\r\n        New love and honor,\r\n  And crown her the Queen of a Hundred Years!\r\n\r\n  North and South, we are met as brothers;\r\n    East and West, we are wedded as one;\r\n  Right of each shall secure our mother's;\r\n    Child of each is her faithful son.\r\n        We give thee heart and hand,\r\n        Our glorious native land,\r\n  For battle has tried thee, and time endears.\r\n        We will write thy story,\r\n        And keep thy glory\r\n  As pure as of old for a Thousand Years!\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN SUPERIOR.\r\n\r\n     HENRY DAVID THOREAU, American author and naturalist. Born in\r\n     Concord, Mass., 1817; died in 1862. From his \"Excursions\" (1863).\r\n     By permission of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Publishers,\r\n     Boston.\r\n\r\nIf the moon looks larger here than in Europe, probably the sun looks\r\nlarger also. If the heavens of America appear infinitely higher and the\r\nstars brighter, I trust that these facts are symbolical of the height to\r\nwhich the philosophy and poetry and religion of her inhabitants may one\r\nday soar. At length, perchance, the immaterial heaven will appear as\r\nmuch higher to the American mind, and the intimations that star it, as\r\nmuch brighter. For I believe that climate does thus react on man, as\r\nthere is something in the mountain air that feeds the spirit and\r\ninspires. Will not man grow to greater perfection intellectually as well\r\nas physically under these influences? Or is it unimportant how many\r\nfoggy days there are in his life? I trust that we shall be more\r\nimaginative, that our thoughts will be clearer, fresher, and more\r\nethereal, as our sky; our understanding more comprehensive and broader,\r\nlike our plains; our intellect generally on a grander scale, like our\r\nthunder and lightning, our rivers, and mountains, and forests, and our\r\nhearts shall even correspond in breadth and depth and grandeur to our\r\ninland seas. Else to what end does the world go on, and why was America\r\ndiscovered?\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SCENERY.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM TUDOR, an American _littérateur_. Born at Boston in 1779;\r\n     died, 1830.\r\n\r\nOur numerous waterfalls and the enchanting beauty of our lakes afford\r\nmany objects of the most picturesque character; while the inland seas,\r\nfrom Superior to Ontario, and that astounding cataract, whose roar would\r\nhardly be increased by the united murmurs of all the cascades of Europe,\r\nare calculated to inspire vast and sublime conceptions. The effects,\r\ntoo, of our climate, composed of a Siberian winter and an Italian\r\nsummer, furnish new and peculiar objects for description. The\r\ncircumstances of remote regions are here blended, and strikingly\r\nopposite appearances witnessed, in the same spot, at different seasons\r\nof the year. In our winters, we have the sun at the same altitude as in\r\nItaly, shining on an unlimited surface of snow, which can only be found\r\nin the higher latitudes of Europe, where the sun, in the winter, rises\r\nlittle above the horizon. The dazzling brilliancy of a winter's day and\r\na moonlight night, in an atmosphere astonishingly clear and frosty, when\r\nthe utmost splendor of the sky is reflected from a surface of spotless\r\nwhite, attended with the most excessive cold, is peculiar to the\r\nnorthern part of the United States. What, too, can surpass the celestial\r\npurity and transparency of the atmosphere in a fine autumnal day, when\r\nour vision and our thought seem carried to the third heaven; the\r\ngorgeous magnificence of the close, when the sun sinks from our view,\r\nsurrounded with various masses of clouds, fringed with gold and purple,\r\nand reflecting, in evanescent tints, all the hues of the rainbow.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERTY HAS A CONTINENT OF HER OWN.\r\n\r\n     HORACE WALPOLE, fourth Earl of Oxford, a famous English literary\r\n     gossip, amateur, and wit. Born in London, October, 1717; died,\r\n     March, 1797.\r\n\r\nLiberty has still a continent to exist in.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n     DANIEL WEBSTER, the celebrated American statesman, jurist, and\r\n     orator. Born at Salisbury, N. H., January 18, 1782; died at\r\n     Marshfield, Mass., October 24, 1852.\r\n\r\nI profess to feel a strong attachment to the liberty of the United\r\nStates; to the constitution and free institutions of the United States;\r\nto the honor, and I may say the glory, of this great Government and\r\ngreat country.\r\n\r\nI feel every injury inflicted upon this country almost as a personal\r\ninjury. I blush for every fault which I think I see committed in its\r\npublic councils as if they were faults or mistakes of my own.\r\n\r\nI know that, at this moment, there is no object upon earth so attracting\r\nthe gaze of the intelligent and civilized nations of the earth as this\r\ngreat Republic. All men look at us, all men examine our course, all good\r\nmen are anxious for a favorable result to this great experiment of\r\nrepublican liberty. We are on a hill and can not be hid. We can not\r\nwithdraw ourselves either from the commendation or the reproaches of the\r\ncivilized world. They see us as that star of empire which, half a\r\ncentury ago, was predicted as making its way westward. I wish they may\r\nsee it as a mild, placid, though brilliant orb, making its way athwart\r\nthe whole heavens, to the enlightening and cheering of mankind; and not\r\na meteor of fire and blood, terrifying the nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENIUS OF THE WEST.\r\n\r\n     JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER, the distinguished American poet. Born at\r\n     Haverhill, Mass, December 17, 1807. From his poem, \"On receiving an\r\n     eagle's quill from Lake Superior.\" By permission of Messrs.\r\n     Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Publishers, Boston.\r\n\r\n  I hear the tread of pioneers,\r\n    Of nations yet to be;\r\n  The first low wash of waves, where soon\r\n    Shall roll a human sea.\r\n\r\n  The rudiments of empire here\r\n    Are plastic yet and warm;\r\n  The chaos of a mighty world\r\n    Is rounding into form.\r\n\r\n  Each rude and jostling fragment soon\r\n    Its fitting place shall find--\r\n  The raw material of a state,\r\n    Its muscle and its mind.\r\n\r\n  And, westering still, the star which leads\r\n    The New World in its train\r\n  Has tipped with fire the icy spears\r\n    Of many a mountain chain.\r\n\r\n  The snowy cones of Oregon\r\n    Are kindling on its way;\r\n  And California's golden sands\r\n    Gleam brighter in its ray.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOD SAVE AMERICA.\r\n\r\n     ROBERT C. WINTHROP, an American statesman and orator. Born in\r\n     Boston, Mass., May 12, 1809. From his \"Centennial Oration,\"\r\n     delivered in Boston, 1876.\r\n\r\nInstruments and wheels of the invisible governor of the universe! This\r\nis indeed all which the greatest men ever have been, or ever can be. No\r\nflatteries of courtiers, no adulations of the multitude, no audacity of\r\nself-reliance, no intoxications of success, no evolutions or\r\ndevelopments of science, can make more or other of them. This is \"the\r\nsea-mark of their utmost sail,\" the goal of their farthest run, the very\r\nround and top of their highest soaring. Oh, if there could be to-day a\r\ndeeper and more pervading impression of this great truth throughout our\r\nland, and a more prevailing conformity of our thoughts and words and\r\nacts to the lessons which it involves; if we could lift ourselves to a\r\nloftier sense of our relations to the invisible; if, in surveying our\r\npast history, we could catch larger and more exalted views of our\r\ndestinies and our responsibilities; if we could realize that the want of\r\ngood men may be a heavier woe to a land than any want of what the world\r\ncalls great men, our centennial year would not only be signalized by\r\nsplendid ceremonials, and magnificent commemorations, and gorgeous\r\nexpositions, but it would go far toward fulfilling something of the\r\ngrandeur of that \"acceptable year,\" which was announced by higher than\r\nhuman lips, and would be the auspicious promise and pledge of a glorious\r\nsecond century of independence and freedom for our country. For, if that\r\nsecond century of self-government is to go on safely to its close, or is\r\nto go on safely and prosperously at all, there must be some renewal of\r\nthat old spirit of subordination and obedience to divine, as well as\r\nhuman, laws, which has been our security in the past. There must be\r\nfaith in something higher and better than ourselves. There must be a\r\nreverent acknowledgment of an unseen, but all-seeing, all-controlling\r\nRuler of the Universe. His word, His house, His day, His worship, must\r\nbe sacred to our children, as they have been to their fathers; and His\r\nblessing must never fail to be invoked upon our land and upon our\r\nliberties. The patriot voice, which cried from the balcony of yonder old\r\nState House, when the declaration had been originally proclaimed,\r\n\"stability and perpetuity to American independence,\" did not fail to\r\nadd, \"God save our American States.\" I would prolong that ancestral\r\nprayer. And the last phrase to pass my lips at this hour, and to take\r\nits chance for remembrance or oblivion in years to come, as the\r\nconclusion of this centennial oration, and as the sum and summing up of\r\nall I can say to the present or the future, shall be: There is, there\r\ncan be, no independence of God; in Him, as a nation, no less than in\r\nHim, as individuals, \"we live, and move, and have our being!\" GOD SAVE\r\nOUR AMERICAN STATES!\r\n\r\n\r\nA VOICE OF WARNING.\r\n\r\n     From \"Things that Threaten the Destruction of American\r\n     Institutions,\" a sermon by T. DE WITT TALMAGE, delivered in\r\n     Brooklyn Tabernacle, October 12, 1884.\r\n\r\nWhat! can a nation die? Yes; there has been great mortality among\r\nmonarchies and republics. Like individuals, they are born, have a middle\r\nlife and a decease, a cradle and a grave. Sometimes they are\r\nassassinated and sometimes they suicide. Call the roll, and let some one\r\nanswer for them. Egyptian civilization, stand up! Dead, answer the ruins\r\nof Karnak and Luxor. Dead, respond in chorus the seventy pyramids on the\r\neast side the Nile. Assyrian Empire, stand up! Dead, answer the charred\r\nruins of Nineveh. After 600 years of opportunity, dead. Israelitish\r\nKingdom, stand up! After 250 years of miraculous vicissitude, and Divine\r\nintervention, and heroic achievement, and appalling depravity, dead.\r\nPhoenicia, stand up! After inventing the alphabet and giving it to the\r\nworld, and sending out her merchant caravans to Central Asia in one\r\ndirection, and her navigators into the Atlantic Ocean in another\r\ndirection, and 500 years of prosperity, dead. Dead, answer the \"Pillars\r\nof Hercules\" and the rocks on which the Tyrian fishermen spread their\r\nnets. Athens--after Phidias, after Demosthenes, after Miltiades, after\r\nMarathon--dead. Sparta--after Leonidas, after Eurybiades, after Salamis,\r\nafter Thermopylæ--dead.\r\n\r\nRoman Empire, stand up and answer to the roll-call! Once bounded on the\r\nnorth by the British Channel and on the south by the Sahara Desert of\r\nAfrica, on the east by the Euphrates and on the west by the Atlantic\r\nOcean. Home of three civilizations. Owning all the then discovered world\r\nthat was worth owning. Gibbon, in his \"Rise and Fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire,\" answers, \"Dead.\" And the vacated seats of the ruined Coliseum,\r\nand the skeletons of the aqueduct, and the miasma of the Campagna, and\r\nthe fragments of the marble baths, and the useless piers of the bridge\r\nTriumphalis, and the silenced forum, and the Mamertine dungeon, holding\r\nno more apostolic prisoners; and the arch of Titus, and Basilica of\r\nConstantine, and the Pantheon, lift up a nightly chorus of \"Dead! dead!\"\r\nDead, after Horace, and Virgil, and Tacitus, and Livy, and Cicero; after\r\nHoratius of the bridge, and Cincinnatus, the farmer oligarch; after\r\nScipio, and Cassius, and Constantine, and Cæsar. Her war-eagle, blinded\r\nby flying too near the sun, came reeling down through the heavens, and\r\nthe owl of desolation and darkness made its nest in the forsaken ærie.\r\nMexican Empire, dead! French Empire, dead! You see it is no unusual\r\nthing for a government to perish. And in the same necrology of nations,\r\nand in the same cemetery of expired governments, will go the United\r\nStates of America unless some potent voice shall call a halt, and\r\nthrough Divine interposition, by a purified ballot-box and an\r\nall-pervading moral Christian sentiment, the present evil tendency be\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF COLUMBUS, ST LOUIS, MO.
