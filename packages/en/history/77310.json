Creizenach, _Geschichte des neueren Dramas_ (vol. i,\r\n    1893), Bk. 2; L. Petit de Julleville, _Les Mystères_ (1880),\r\n    vol. i. ch. 2; A. d’Ancona, _Origini del Teatro Italiano_ (2nd\r\n    ed. 1891), Bk. 1, chh. 3-6; M. Sepet, _Origines catholiques\r\n    du Théâtre moderne_ (1901), and by L. Gautier in _Le Monde_\r\n    for Aug. and Sept. 1872. The studies of W. Meyer, _Fragmenta\r\n    Burana_ (1901), and C. Davidson, _English Mystery Plays_\r\n    (1892), are also valuable. A. W. Ward, _History of English\r\n    Dramatic Literature_ (2nd ed. 1899), vol. i. ch. 1 deals\r\n    very slightly with the subject. A good popular account is\r\n    M. Sepet, _Le Drame chrétien au Moyen Âge_ (1878). Of older\r\n    works, the introduction to E. Du Méril’s _Origines latines du\r\n    Théâtre moderne_ (1849, facsimile reprint, 1896) is the best.\r\n    The material collected for vol. ii of C. Magnin’s _Origines\r\n    du Théâtre_ is only available in the form of reviews in the\r\n    _Journal des Savants_ (1846-7), and lecture notes in the\r\n    _Journal général de l’Instruction publique_ (1834-6). Articles\r\n    by F. Clément, L. Deschamps de Pas, A. de la Fons-Melicocq, and\r\n    others in A. N. Didron’s _Annales archéologiques_ (1844-72)\r\n    are worth consulting; those of F. Clément are reproduced in\r\n    his _Histoire de la Musique religieuse_ (1860). There are also\r\n    some notices in J. de Douhet, _Dictionnaire des Mystères_\r\n    (1854).—The texts of the _Quem quaeritis_ are to be studied\r\n    in G. Milchsack, _Die Oster- und Passionsspiele_, vol. i (all\r\n    published, 1880), and C. Lange, _Die lateinischen Osterfeiern_\r\n    (1887). The former compares 28, the latter no less than 224\r\n    manuscripts. The best general collection of texts is that\r\n    of Du Méril already named: others are T. Wright, _Early\r\n    Mysteries and other Latin Poems_ (1838); E. de Coussemaker,\r\n    _Drames liturgiques du Moyen Âge_ (1860), which is valuable\r\n    as giving the music as well as the words; and A. Gasté, _Les\r\n    Drames liturgiques de la Cathédrale de Rouen_ (1893). A few,\r\n    including the important _Antichristus_, are given by R.\r\n    Froning, _Das Drama des Mittelalters_ (1891). The original\r\n    sources are in most cases the ordinary service-books. But\r\n    a twelfth-century manuscript from St. Martial of Limoges\r\n    (_Bibl. Nat. Lat._ 1139) has four plays, a _Quem quaeritis_,\r\n    a _Rachel_, a _Prophetae_, and the _Sponsus_. Facsimiles\r\n    are in E. de Coussemaker, _Histoire de l’Harmonie au Moyen\r\n    Âge_ (1852). A thirteenth-century manuscript from Fleury\r\n    (_Orleans MS._ 178) has no less than ten, a _Quem quaeritis_,\r\n    a _Peregrini_, a _Stella_ in two parts, a _Conversio Pauli_,\r\n    a _Suscitatio Lazari_ and four _Miracula S. Nicholai_. Two\r\n    later plays and fragments of three others are found in the\r\n    famous thirteenth-century manuscript from Benedictbeuern\r\n    (_Munich MS._ 19,486, printed in J. A. Schmeller, _Carmina\r\n    Burana_, 3rd ed. 1894, with additional fragments in W. Meyer,\r\n    _Fragmenta Burana_, 1901). This is probably the repertory of\r\n    travelling goliardic clerks. The twelfth-century manuscript\r\n    which preserves the three plays of Hilarius (_Bibl. Nat. Lat._\r\n    11,331, printed in J. J. Champollion-Figeac, _Hilarii Versus et\r\n    Ludi_, 1838) is of a similar character.—The tropes are fully\r\n    dealt with by L. Gautier, _Hist. de la Poésie liturgique au\r\n    Moyen Âge_, vol. i (all published, 1886), and W. H. Frere,\r\n    _The Winchester Troper_ (1894). I have not been able to see\r\n    A. Reiners, _Die Tropen-, Prosen- und Präfations-Gesänge des\r\n    feierlichen Hochamtes im Mittelalter_ (1884). Antiquarian data\r\n    are collected by H. J. Feasey, _Ancient English Holy Week\r\n    Ceremonial_ (1897), and A. Heales, _Easter Sepulchres_, in\r\n    _Archaeologia_, vol. xlii. I have printed an important passage\r\n    from the _Regularis Concordia_ of St. Ethelwold (965-75) in\r\n    Appendix O. The _Planctus Mariae_ are treated by A. Schönbach,\r\n    _Die Marienklagen_ (1874), and E. Wechssler, _Die romanischen\r\n    Marienklagen_ (1893). W. Köppen, _Beiträge zur Geschichte\r\n    der deutschen Weihnachtsspiele_ (1893), and M. Sepet, _Les\r\n    Prophètes du Christ_ (1878), contain valuable studies of the\r\n    evolution of the _Stella_ and the _Prophetae_ respectively.\r\n    The relation of dramatic to iconic art in the Middle Ages\r\n    is brought out by P. Weber, _Geistliches Schauspiel und\r\n    kirchliche Kunst_ (1894). A rather primitive bibliography is\r\n    F. H. Stoddard, _References for Students of Miracle Plays and\r\n    Mysteries_ (1887).—Authorities for English facts given without\r\n    references in the present volume will be found in Appendices W\r\n    and X.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussions of the first volume have often wandered far enough from\r\nthe history of the stage. But two or three tolerable generalizations\r\nemerge. The drama as a living form of art went completely under at the\r\nbreak-up of the Roman world: a process of natural decay was accelerated\r\nby the hostility of Christianity, which denied the theatre, and by the\r\nindifference of barbarism, which had never imagined it. If anything of a\r\nhistrionic tradition survived, it took the shape of pitiable farce, one\r\namongst many heterogeneous elements in the _spectacula_ of disreputable\r\nmimes. For the men of the Middle Ages, however, peasants or burghers,\r\nmonks or nobles, such _spectacula_ had a constant attraction: and the\r\npersistence of the deep-rooted mimetic instinct in the folk is proved\r\nby the frequent outcrops of primitive drama in the course of those\r\npopular observances which are the last sportive stage of ancient heathen\r\nritual. Whether of folk or of minstrel origin, the _ludi_ remained to\r\nthe last alien and distasteful to the Church. The degradation of Rome\r\nand Constantinople by the stage was never forgotten; nor the association\r\nwith an heathenism that was glossed over rather than extinct: and though\r\na working compromise inevitably tended to establish itself, it remained\r\nsubject to perpetual protest from the austerer spirit in the counsels of\r\nthe clergy.\r\n\r\nIt is the more remarkable that the present volume has to describe a most\r\nsingular new birth of the drama in the very bosom of the Church’s own\r\nritual. One may look at the event as one will, either as an audacious,\r\nand at least partly successful, attempt to wrest the pomps of the devil\r\nto a spiritual service, or as an inevitable and ironical recoil of a\r\nbarred human instinct within the hearts of its gaolers themselves. From\r\neither point of view it is a fact which the student of European culture\r\ncannot afford to neglect. And apart from its sociological implications,\r\napart from the insight which it gives into the temper of the folk and\r\ninto the appeal of religion, it is of the highest interest as an object\r\nlesson in literary evolution. The historian is not often privileged to\r\nisolate a definite literary form throughout the whole course of its\r\ndevelopment, and to trace its rudimentary beginnings, as may here be\r\ndone, beyond the very borders of articulate speech.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic tendencies of Christian worship declared themselves at\r\nan early period[1]. At least from the fourth century, the central and\r\nmost solemn rite of that worship was the Mass, an essentially dramatic\r\ncommemoration of one of the most critical moments in the life of the\r\nFounder[2]. It is his very acts and words that day by day throughout\r\nthe year the officiating priest resumes in the face of the people.\r\nAnd when the conception of the Mass developed until instead of a mere\r\nsymbolical commemoration it was looked upon as an actual repetition of\r\nthe initial sacrifice, the dramatic character was only intensified. So\r\nfar as the Canon of the Mass goes, this point needs no pressing. But the\r\nsame liturgical principle governs many other episodes in the order of the\r\nmediaeval services. Take, for example, the ritual, of Gallican origin,\r\nused at the dedication of a church[3]. The bishop and his procession\r\napproach the closed doors of the church from without, but one of the\r\nclergy, _quasi latens_, is placed inside. Three blows with a staff are\r\ngiven on the doors, and the anthem is raised _Tollite portas, principes,\r\nvestras et elevamini, portae aeternales, et introibit Rex gloriae_. From\r\nwithin comes the question _Quis est iste rex gloriae?_ and the reply is\r\ngiven _Dominus virtutum ipse est Rex gloriae_. Then the doors are opened,\r\nand as the procession sweeps through, he who was concealed within slips\r\nout, _quasi fugiens_, to join the train. It is a dramatic expulsion of\r\nthe spirit of evil. A number of other instances are furnished by the\r\nelaborate rites of Holy week. Thus on Palm Sunday, in commemoration of\r\nthe entry into Jerusalem, the usual procession before Mass was extended,\r\nand went outside the church and round the churchyard or close bearing\r\npalms, or in their place sprigs of yew, box, or withies, which the priest\r\nhad previously blessed[4]. The introduction of a _Palmesel_ might make\r\nthe ceremony more dramatic still[5]. Some of the texts used were of a\r\nprophetic character, and the singer of these was occasionally dressed\r\nas a prophet[6]. At the doors of the church the procession was greeted\r\nby boys stationed upon the roof of the porch, and certain French uses\r\ntransferred to the occasion the dedication solemnity of _Tollite portas_\r\njust described[7]. The reading of the gospel narratives of the Passion,\r\nwhich on Palm Sunday, on the Monday or Tuesday, and the Wednesday in Holy\r\nweek and on Good Friday preceded the Gospel proper, was often resolved\r\ninto a regular oratorio. A tenor voice rendered the narrative of the\r\nevangelist, a treble the sayings of Jews and disciples, a bass those\r\nof Christ himself[8]. To particular episodes of these Passions special\r\ndramatic action was appropriated. On Wednesday, at the words _Velum\r\ntempli scissum est_, the Lenten veil, which since the first Sunday in\r\nLent had hidden the sanctuary from the sight of the people, was dropped\r\nto the ground[9]. On Good Friday the words _Partiti sunt vestimenta_\r\nwere a signal for a similar bit of by-play with a linen cloth which lay\r\nupon the altar[10]: Maundy Thursday had its commemorative ceremony of the\r\nwashing of feet[11]; while the _Tenebrae_ or solemn extinction, one after\r\nanother, of lights at the Matins of the last three days of the week, was\r\nheld to symbolize the grief of the apostles and others whom those lights\r\nrepresented[12].\r\n\r\nThese, and many other fragments of ceremonial, have the potentiality\r\nof dramatic development. Symbolism, mimetic action, are there. The\r\nother important factor, of dialogued speech, is latent in the practice\r\nof antiphonal singing. The characteristic type of Roman chant is that\r\nwhereby the two halves of the choir answer one another, or the whole\r\nchoir answers the single voice of the _cantor_, in alternate versicle and\r\nrespond[13]. The antiphon was introduced into Italy by St. Ambrose of\r\nMilan. It had originated, according to tradition, in Antioch, had been in\r\nsome relation to the histrionic tendencies of Arianism, and was possibly\r\nnot altogether uninfluenced by the traditions both of the Greek tragic\r\nchorus and of Jewish psalmody[14]. At any rate, it lent itself naturally\r\nto dialogue, and it is from the antiphon that the actual evolution of\r\nthe liturgical drama starts. The course of that evolution must now be\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nThe choral portions of the Mass were stereotyped about the end of the\r\nsixth century in the _Antiphonarium_ ascribed to Gregory the Great[15].\r\nThis compilation, which included a variety of antiphons arranged for the\r\ndifferent feasts and seasons of the year, answered the needs of worship\r\nfor some two hundred years. With the ninth century, however, began a\r\nprocess, which culminated in the eleventh, of liturgical elaboration.\r\nSplendid churches, costly vestments, protracted offices, magnificent\r\nprocessions, answered especially in the great monasteries to a heightened\r\nsense of the significance of cult in general, and of the Eucharist\r\nin particular[16]. Naturally ecclesiastical music did not escape the\r\ninfluence of this movement. The traditional _Antiphonarium_ seemed\r\ninadequate to the capacities of aspiring choirs. The Gregorian texts were\r\nnot replaced, but they were supplemented. New melodies were inserted\r\nat the beginning or end or even in the middle of the old antiphons.\r\nAnd now I come to the justification of the statement made two or three\r\npages back, that the beginnings of the liturgical drama lie beyond the\r\nvery borders of articulate speech. For the earliest of such adventitious\r\nmelodies were sung not to words at all, but to vowel sounds alone. These,\r\nfor which precedent existed in the Gregorian _Antiphonarium_, are known\r\nas _neumae_[17]. Obviously the next stage was to write texts, called\r\ngenerically ‘tropes,’ to them; and towards the end of the ninth century\r\nthree more or less independent schools of trope-writers grew up. One,\r\nin northern France, produced Adam of St. Victor; of another, at the\r\nBenedictine abbey of St. Gall near Constance, Notker and Tutilo are the\r\ngreatest names; the third, in northern Italy, has hitherto been little\r\nstudied. The _Troparia_ or collections of tropes form choir-books,\r\nsupplementary to the _Antiphonaria_. After the thirteenth century, when\r\ntrope-writing fell into comparative desuetude, they become rare; and\r\nsuch tropes as were retained find a place in the ordinary service-books,\r\nespecially the later successor of the _Antiphonarium_, the _Graduale_.\r\nThe tropes attached themselves in varying degrees to most of the choral\r\nportions of the Mass. Perhaps those of the _Alleluia_ at the end of\r\nthe _Graduale_ are in themselves the most important. They received the\r\nspecific names, in Germany of _Sequentiae_, and in France of _Prosae_,\r\nand they include, in their later metrical stages, some of the most\r\nremarkable of mediaeval hymns. But more interesting from our particular\r\npoint of view are the tropes of the _Officium_ or _Introit_, the antiphon\r\nand psalm sung by the choir at the beginning of Mass, as the celebrant\r\napproaches the altar[18].\r\n\r\nSeveral _Introit_ tropes take a dialogue form. The following is a\r\nninth-century Christmas example ascribed to Tutilo of St. Gall[19].\r\n\r\n    ‘Hodie cantandus est nobis puer, quem gignebat ineffabiliter\r\n    ante tempora pater, et eundem sub tempore generavit inclyta\r\n    mater.\r\n\r\n    _Int[errogatio]._\r\n\r\n    quis est iste puer quem tam magnis praeconiis dignum\r\n    vociferatis? dicite nobis ut collaudatores esse possimus.\r\n\r\n    _Resp[onsio]._\r\n\r\n    hic enim est quem praesagus et electus symmista dei ad terram\r\n    venturum praeuidens longe ante praenotavit, sicque praedixit.’\r\n\r\nThe nature of this trope is obvious. It was sung by two groups of voices,\r\nand its closing words directly introduce the _Introit_ for the third\r\nmass (_Magna missa_) on Christmas day, which must have followed without\r\na break[20]. It is an example of some half a dozen dialogued _Introit_\r\ntropes, which might have, but did not, become the starting-point for\r\nfurther dramatic evolution[21]. Much more significant is another trope of\r\nunknown authorship found in the same St. Gall manuscript[22]. This is for\r\nEaster, and is briefly known as the _Quem quaeritis_. The text, unlike\r\nthat of the _Hodie cantandus_, is based closely upon the Gospels. It is\r\nan adaptation to the form of dialogue of the interview between the three\r\nMaries and the angel at the tomb as told by Saints Matthew and Mark[23].\r\n\r\n  ‘Quem quaeritis in sepulchro, [o] Christicolae?\r\n\r\n  Iesum Nazarenum crucifixum, o caelicolae.\r\n\r\n  non est hic, surrexit sicut praedixerat.\r\n  ite, nuntiate quia surrexit de sepulchro.\r\n                           _Resurrexi_[24].’\r\n\r\nThis is the earliest and simplest form of the _Quem quaeritis_. It\r\nrecurs, almost unaltered, in a tenth-century troper from St. Martial\r\nof Limoges[25]. In eleventh-century tropers of the same church it is a\r\nlittle more elaborate[26].\r\n\r\n  ‘TROPUS IN DIE.\r\n\r\n  Quem quaeritis in sepulchro, Christicolae?\r\n\r\n  Ihesum Nazarenum crucifixum, o caelicole.\r\n\r\n  non est hic, surrexit sicut praedixerat,\r\n  ite, nuntiate quia surrexit. Alleluia.\r\n\r\n  ad sepulchrum residens angelus nuntiat resurrexisse Christum:\r\n  en ecce completum est illud quod olim ipse per prophetam dixerat ad\r\n    patrem taliter inquiens,\r\n                                      _Resurrexi_.’\r\n\r\nHere the appended portion of narrative makes the trope slightly less\r\ndramatic. Yet another addition is made in one of the Limoges manuscripts.\r\nJust as the trope introduces the _Introit_, so it is itself introduced by\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n  ‘Hora est, psallite. iube, dompnus, canere.\r\n    eia, eia, dicite.’\r\n\r\nAs M. Gautier puts it, the trope is troped[27].\r\n\r\nIn the Easter _Quem quaeritis_ the liturgical drama was born, and to it\r\nI shall return. But it must first be noted that it was so popular as to\r\nbecome the model for two very similar tropes belonging to Christmas and\r\nto the Ascension. Both of these are found in more than one troper, but\r\nnot earlier, I believe, than the eleventh century. I quote the Christmas\r\ntrope from a St. Gall manuscript[28].\r\n\r\n    ‘_In Natale Domini ad Missam sint parati duo diaconi induti\r\n    dalmaticis, retro altare dicentes_\r\n\r\n    Quem quaeritis in praesepe, pastores, dicite?\r\n\r\n    _Respondeant duo cantores in choro_\r\n\r\n    salvatorem Christum Dominum, infantem pannis involutum,\r\n    secundum sermonem angelicum.\r\n\r\n    _Item diaconi_\r\n\r\n    adest hic parvulus cum Maria, matre sua, de qua, vaticinando,\r\n    Isaias Propheta: ecce virgo concipiet et pariet filium. et\r\n    nuntiantes dicite quia natus est.\r\n\r\n    _Tunc cantor dicat excelsa voce_\r\n\r\n    alleluia, alleluia, iam vere scimus Christum natum in terris,\r\n    de quo canite, omnes, cum Propheta dicentes:\r\n\r\n                                                  _Puer natus est_.’\r\n\r\nThe Ascension trope is taken from an English troper probably belonging to\r\nChrist Church, Canterbury[29].\r\n\r\n    ‘Quem cernitis ascendisse super astra, o Christicolae?\r\n\r\n    Ihesum qui surrexit de sepulchro, o caelicolae.\r\n\r\n    iam ascendit, ut praedixit, ascendo ad patrem meum et patrem\r\n        vestrum, deum meum et deum vestrum.\r\n\r\n    alleluia:\r\n    regna terrae, gentes, linguae, conlaudate dominum:\r\n    quem adorant caeli cives in paterno solio:\r\n    deo gratias dicite eia.’\r\n\r\nI return now to the Easter _Quem quaeritis_. In a few churches this\r\nretained its position at the beginning of Mass, either as an _Introit_\r\ntrope in the strict sense, or, which comes to much the same thing, as a\r\nchant for the procession which immediately preceded. This was the use of\r\nthe Benedictine abbey of Monte Cassino at the beginning of the twelfth\r\ncentury, of that of St. Denys in the thirteenth[30], and of the church\r\nof St. Martin of Tours in the fifteenth[31]. Even in the seventeenth\r\ncentury the _Quem quaeritis_ still appears in a Paris manuscript as a\r\n‘_tropus_[32],’ and Martene records a practice similar to that of Monte\r\nCassino and St. Denys as surviving at Rheims in his day[33].\r\n\r\nBut in many tropers, and in most of the later service-books in which it\r\nis found, the _Quem quaeritis_ no longer appears to be designed for use\r\nat the Mass. This is the case in the only two tropers of English use in\r\nwhich, so far as I know, it comes, the Winchester ones printed by Mr.\r\nFrere[34]. I reproduce the earlier of these from the Bodleian manuscript\r\nused by him[35].\r\n\r\n    ‘ANGELICA DE CHRISTI RESURRECTIONE.\r\n\r\n      Quem quaeritis in sepulchro, Christicolae?\r\n\r\n    _Sanctarum mulierum responsio._\r\n\r\n      Ihesum Nazarenum crucifixum, o caelicola!\r\n\r\n    _Angelicae voces consolatus._\r\n\r\n      non est hic, surrexit sicut praedixerat,\r\n      ite, nuntiate quia surrexit, dicentes:\r\n\r\n    _Sanctarum mulierum ad omnem clerum modulatio_:\r\n\r\n      alleluia! resurrexit Dominus hodie,\r\n      leo fortis, Christus filius Dei! Deo gratias dicite, eia!\r\n\r\n    _Dicat angelus_:\r\n\r\n      venite et videte locum ubi positus erat Dominus, alleluia! alleluia!\r\n\r\n    _Iterum dicat angelus_:\r\n\r\n      cito euntes dicite discipulis quia surrexit Dominus, alleluia!\r\n        alleluia!\r\n\r\n    _Mulieri una voce canant iubilantes_:\r\n\r\n      surrexit Dominus de sepulchro,\r\n      qui pro nobis pependit in ligno.’\r\n\r\nIn this manuscript, which is dated by Mr. Frere in 979 or 980, the text\r\njust quoted is altogether detached from the Easter day tropes. Its\r\nheading is rubricated and immediately follows the tropes for Palm Sunday.\r\nIt is followed in its turn, under a fresh rubric, by the ceremonies for\r\nHoly Saturday, beginning with the _Benedictio Cerei_. From the second,\r\nsomewhat later Cambridge manuscript, probably of the early eleventh\r\ncentury, the Holy Saturday ceremonies have disappeared, but the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_ still precedes and does not follow the regular Easter tropes,\r\nwhich are headed _Tropi in die Christi Resurrectionis_[36]. The precise\r\nposition which the _Quem quaeritis_ was intended to take in the Easter\r\nservices is not evident from these tropers by themselves. Fortunately\r\nanother document comes to our assistance. This is the _Concordia\r\nRegularis_, an appendix to the _Rule_ of St. Benedict intended for the\r\nuse of the Benedictine monasteries in England reformed by Dunstan during\r\nthe tenth century. The _Concordia Regularis_ was drawn up by Ethelwold,\r\nbishop of Winchester, as a result of a council of Winchester held at some\r\nuncertain date during the reign of Edgar (959-79); it may fairly be taken\r\nfor granted that it fixed at least the Winchester custom. I translate the\r\naccount of the _Quem quaeritis_ ceremony, which is described as forming\r\npart, not of the Mass, but of the third Nocturn at Matins on Easter\r\nmorning[37].\r\n\r\n    ‘While the third lesson is being chanted, let four brethren\r\n    vest themselves. Let one of these, vested in an alb, enter as\r\n    though to take part in the service, and let him approach the\r\n    sepulchre without attracting attention and sit there quietly\r\n    with a palm in his hand. While the third respond is chanted,\r\n    let the remaining three follow, and let them all, vested in\r\n    copes, bearing in their hands thuribles with incense, and\r\n    stepping delicately as those who seek something, approach the\r\n    sepulchre. These things are done in imitation of the angel\r\n    sitting in the monument, and the women with spices coming to\r\n    anoint the body of Jesus. When therefore he who sits there\r\n    beholds the three approach him like folk lost and seeking\r\n    something, let him begin in a dulcet voice of medium pitch to\r\n    sing _Quem quaeritis_. And when he has sung it to the end, let\r\n    the three reply in unison _Ihesu Nazarenum_. So he, _Non est\r\n    hic, surrexit sicut praedixerat. Ite, nuntiate quia surrexit a\r\n    mortuis._ At the word of this bidding let those three turn to\r\n    the choir and say _Alleluia! resurrexit Dominus!_ This said,\r\n    let the one, still sitting there and as if recalling them, say\r\n    the anthem _Venite et videte locum_. And saying this, let him\r\n    rise, and lift the veil, and show them the place bare of the\r\n    cross, but only the cloths laid there in which the cross was\r\n    wrapped. And when they have seen this, let them set down the\r\n    thuribles which they bare in that same sepulchre, and take\r\n    the cloth, and hold it up in the face of the clergy, and as\r\n    if to demonstrate that the Lord has risen and is no longer\r\n    wrapped therein, let them sing the anthem _Surrexit Dominus\r\n    de sepulchro_, and lay the cloth upon the altar. When the\r\n    anthem is done, let the prior, sharing in their gladness at the\r\n    triumph of our King, in that, having vanquished death, He rose\r\n    again, begin the hymn _Te Deum laudamus_. And this begun, all\r\n    the bells chime out together.’\r\n\r\nThe liberal _scenario_ of the _Concordia Regularis_ makes plain the\r\nchange which has come about in the character of the _Quem quaeritis_\r\nsince it was first sung by alternating half-choirs as an _Introit_\r\ntrope[38]. Dialogued chant and mimetic action have come together and the\r\nfirst liturgical drama is, in all its essentials, complete.\r\n\r\nI am not quite satisfied as to the relations of date between the\r\n_Concordia Regularis_ and the Winchester tropers, or as to whether the\r\n_Quem quaeritis_ was intended in one or both of these manuscripts for\r\nuse at the Easter Matins[39]. But it is clear that such a use was known\r\nin England at any rate before the end of the tenth century. It was also\r\nknown in France and in Germany: the former fact is testified to by the\r\n_Consuetudines_ of the monastery of St. Vito of Verdun[40]; the latter\r\nby the occurrence of the _Quem quaeritis_ in a troper of Bamberg, where\r\nit has the heading _Ad visitandum sepulchrum_ and is followed by the\r\nMatins chant of _Te Deum_[41].\r\n\r\nThe heading of the Bamberg version and the detailed description of\r\nthe _Concordia Regularis_ bring the _Quem quaeritis_ drama into close\r\nrelations with the Easter ‘sepulchre’[42]. They are indeed the first\r\nhistorical notices of the ceremony so widely popular during the Middle\r\nAges. Some account of the Easter sepulchre must accordingly be inserted\r\nhere, and its basis shall be the admirably full description of St.\r\nEthelwold[43]. He directs that on Good Friday all the monks shall go\r\n_discalceati_ or shoeless from Prime ‘until the cross is adored’[44].\r\nIn the principal service of the day, which begins at Nones, the reading\r\nof the Passion according to St. John and a long series of prayers are\r\nincluded. Then a cross is made ready and laid upon a cushion a little\r\nway in front of the altar. It is unveiled, and the anthem _Ecce lignum\r\ncrucis_ is sung. The abbot advances, prostrates himself, and chants the\r\nseven penitential psalms. Then he humbly kisses the cross. His example is\r\nfollowed by the rest of the monks and by the clergy and congregation. St.\r\nEthelwold proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Since on this day we celebrate the laying down of the body\r\n    of our Saviour, if it seem good or pleasing to any to follow\r\n    on similar lines the use of certain of the religious, which\r\n    is worthy of imitation for the strengthening of faith in the\r\n    unlearned vulgar and in neophytes, we have ordered it on this\r\n    wise. Let a likeness of a sepulchre be made in a vacant part of\r\n    the altar, and a veil stretched on a ring which may hang there\r\n    until the adoration of the cross is over. Let the deacons who\r\n    previously carried the cross come and wrap it in a cloth in\r\n    the place where it was adored[45]. Then let them carry it back,\r\n    singing anthems, until they come to the place of the monument,\r\n    and there having laid down the cross as if it were the buried\r\n    body of our Lord Jesus Christ, let them say an anthem. And here\r\n    let the holy cross be guarded with all reverence until the\r\n    night of the Lord’s resurrection. By night let two brothers or\r\n    three, or more if the throng be sufficient, be appointed who\r\n    may keep faithful wake there chanting psalms.’\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of the burial or _Depositio Crucis_ is followed by the\r\n_Missa Praesanctificatorum_, the Good Friday communion with a host not\r\nconsecrated that day but specially reserved from Maundy Thursday; and\r\nthere is no further reference to the sepulchre until the order for Easter\r\nday itself is reached, when St. Ethelwold directs that ‘before the bells\r\nare rung for Matins the sacristans are to take the cross and set it in a\r\nfitting place.’\r\n\r\nIn the _Concordia Regularis_, then, the _Depositio Crucis_ is a sequel\r\nto the _Adoratio Crucis_ on Good Friday. The latter ceremony, known\r\nfamiliarly to the sixteenth century as ‘creeping to the cross,’ was one\r\nof great antiquity. It was amongst the Holy week rites practised at\r\nJerusalem in the fourth century[46], and was at an early date adopted\r\nin Rome[47]. But the sepulchre was no primitive part of it[48]; nor is\r\nit possible to trace either the use which served St. Ethelwold as a\r\nmodel[49], or the home or date of the sepulchre itself. It is unlikely,\r\nhowever, that the latter originated in England, as it appears almost\r\nsimultaneously on the continent, and English ritual, in the tenth\r\ncentury, was markedly behind and not in advance of that of France and\r\nGermany[50]. St. Ethelwold speaks of it as distinctively monastic but\r\ncertainly not as universal or of obligation amongst the Benedictine\r\ncommunities for whom he wrote. Nor did the _Concordia Regularis_ lead\r\nto its invariable adoption, for when Ælfric adapted St. Ethelwold’s\r\nwork for the benefit of Eynsham about 1005 he omitted the account of\r\nthe sepulchre[51], and it is not mentioned in Archbishop Lanfranc’s\r\nBenedictine _Constitutions_ of 1075[52]. At a later date it was used by\r\nmany Benedictine houses, notably by the great Durham Priory[53]; but the\r\nCistercians and the Carthusians, who represent two of the most famous\r\nreforms of the order, are said never to have adopted it, considering it\r\nincompatible with the austerity of their rule[54]. On the other hand it\r\nwas certainly not, in mediaeval England, confined to monastic churches.\r\nThe cathedrals of Salisbury[55], York[56], Lincoln[57], Hereford[58],\r\nWells[59], all of which were served by secular canons, had their\r\nsepulchres, and the gradual spread of the Sarum use probably brought a\r\nsepulchre into the majority of parish churches throughout the land[60].\r\n\r\nThere are naturally variations and amplifications of the sepulchre\r\nceremonial as described by St. Ethelwold to be recorded. The _Depositio\r\nCrucis_, instead of preceding the _Missa Praesanctificatorum_, was often,\r\nas in the Sarum use, transferred to the end of Vespers, which on Good\r\nFriday followed the _Missa_ without a break[61]. The _Elevatio_ regularly\r\ntook place early on Easter morning before Matins. The oldest custom was\r\ndoubtless that of the _Regularis Concordia_, according to which the cross\r\nwas removed from the sepulchre secretly by the sacristans, since this\r\nis most closely in agreement with the narrative of the gospels. But in\r\ntime the _Elevatio_ became a function. The books of Salisbury and York\r\nprovide for it a procession with the antiphons _Christus resurgens_ and\r\n_Surrexit Dominus_. Continental rituals show considerable diversity of\r\ncustom[62]. Perhaps the most elaborate ceremonials are those of Augsburg\r\nand Würzburg, printed by Milchsack. In these the _Tollite portas_\r\nprocession, which we have already found borrowed from the dedication of\r\nchurches for Palm Sunday, was adapted to Easter day[63]. But the old\r\ntradition was often preserved by the exclusion or only partial admission\r\nof the populace to the _Elevatio_. In the Augsburg ritual just quoted,\r\nall but a few privileged persons are kept out until the devil has been\r\nexpelled and the doors solemnly opened[64]. A curious light is thrown\r\nupon this by a decree of the synod of Worms in 1316, which orders that\r\nthe ‘mystery of the resurrection’ shall be performed before the _plebs_\r\ncomes into the church, and gives as a reason the crowds caused by a\r\nprevalent superstition that whoever saw the crucifix raised would escape\r\nfor that year ‘the inevitable hour of death’[65].\r\n\r\nA widespread if not quite universal innovation on the earlier use was\r\nthe burial, together with the cross or crucifix, of a host, which was\r\nconsecrated, like that used in the _Missa Praesanctificatorum_, on Maundy\r\nThursday. This host was laid in a pyx[66], monstrance[67], or cup[68],\r\nand sometimes in a special image, representing the risen Christ with\r\nthe cross or _labarum_ in his hands, the breast of which held a cavity\r\ncovered with beryl or crystal[69]. Within the sepulchre both the host and\r\nthe crucifix were laid upon or wrapped in a fine linen napkin.\r\n\r\nThe actual structure of the sepulchre lent itself to considerable\r\nvariety. St. Ethelwold’s _assimilatio quaedam sepulchri_ upon a vacant\r\npart of the altar may have been formed, like that at Narbonne several\r\ncenturies later, by laying together some of the silver service-books[70].\r\nThere are other examples of a sepulchre at an altar, and it is possible\r\nthat in some of these the altar itself may have been hollow and have\r\nheld the sacred deposit. Sometimes the high altar was used, but a\r\nside-altar was naturally more convenient, and at St. Lawrence’s, Reading,\r\nthe ‘sepulchre awlter’ was in the rood-loft[71]. The books were a\r\nprimitive expedient. More often the sepulchre was an elaborate carved\r\nshrine of wood, iron, or silver. If this did not stand upon the altar,\r\nit was placed on the north side of the sanctuary or in a north choir\r\naisle. In large churches the crypt was sometimes thought an appropriate\r\nsite[72]. Often the base of the sepulchre was formed by the tomb of a\r\nfounder or benefactor of the church, and legacies for making a structure\r\nto serve this double purpose are not uncommon in mediaeval wills. Such\r\ntombs often have a canopied recess above them, and in these cases the\r\nportable shrine may have been dispensed with. Many churches have a niche\r\nor recess, designed of sole purpose for the sepulchre[73]. Several of\r\nthese more elaborate sepulchres are large enough to be entered, a very\r\nconvenient arrangement for the _Quem quaeritis_[74]; a few of them are\r\nregular chapels, more than one of which is an exact reproduction of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and is probably due to the piety of some\r\nlocal pilgrim[75]. Wood, metal, or stone, permanent or movable, the\r\nsepulchre was richly adorned with paintings and carvings of the Passion\r\nand the Resurrection, with Easter texts, with figures of censer-swinging\r\nangels and sleeping knights[76]. A seal was, at least at Hereford and\r\nin Hungary, set upon it[77]. A canopy was hung over it and upon it lay\r\na pall, also a favourite object for a pious legacy. Similar legacies\r\nmight meet the expense of the ‘sepulchre light,’ which was kept burning\r\nfrom Good Friday to Easter morning, and was only extinguished for a few\r\nminutes on Easter Saturday to be re-lit from the freshly blessed ‘new\r\nfire[78].’ Or the light might be provided by one of the innumerable\r\nguilds of the Middle Ages, whose members, perhaps, also undertook the\r\ndevout duty of keeping the two nights’ vigil before the sepulchre[79].\r\nThis watch was important. The Augsburg ritual already quoted makes the\r\npossibility of arranging it a condition of setting up the sepulchre\r\nat all[80]. The watchers sang psalms, and it is an example of the\r\nirrepressible mediaeval tendency to _mimesis_ that they were sometimes\r\naccoutred like the knights of Pilate[81]. After the _Elevatio_, the\r\ncrucifix seems to have been placed upon a side-altar and visited by\r\nprocessions in Easter, while the host was reserved in a tabernacle. The\r\nSarum _Custumary_ directs that the empty sepulchre shall be daily censed\r\nat Vespers and removed on the Friday in Easter week before Mass[82].\r\nNaturally there was some division of opinion at the Reformation as to\r\nthe precise spiritual value of the Easter sepulchre. While Bishop Hooper\r\nand his fellow pulpiters were outspoken about the idolatrous cult of a\r\n‘dead post[83],’ the more conservative views which ruled in the latter\r\nyears of Henry VIII declared the ceremony to be ‘very laudable’ and\r\n‘not to be contemned and cast away[84].’ The Cromwellian _Injunctions_\r\nof 1538 sanctioned the continued use of the sepulchre light, and by\r\nimplication of the sepulchre itself. The Edwardine _Injunctions_ of\r\n1547 suppressed the sepulchre light and were certainly interpreted by\r\nCranmer and others as suppressing the sepulchre[85]. The closely related\r\n‘creeping to the cross’ was forbidden by proclamation in 1548; and in\r\n1549, after the issue of the first Act of Uniformity and the first Prayer\r\nBook of Edward VI, the disallowance of both ceremonies was legalized,\r\nor renewed by _Articles_ for the visitation of that year[86]. Payments\r\nfor the breaking up of the sepulchre now appear in many churchwardens’\r\naccounts, to be complicated before long by payments for setting the\r\nsepulchre up again, in consequence of an order by Queen Mary in 1554[87].\r\nIn the same year the crucifix and pyx were missing out of the sepulchre\r\nat St. Pancras’ Church in Cheapside, when the priests came for the\r\n_Elevatio_ on Easter morning, and one Marsh was committed to the Counter\r\nfor the sacrilege[88]. The Elizabethan _Injunctions_ of 1559, although\r\nthey do not specifically name the sepulchre, doubtless led to its final\r\ndisappearance[89]. In many parts of the continent it naturally lasted\r\nlonger, but the term ‘visiting sepulchres’ seems in modern times to have\r\nbeen transferred to the devotion paid to the reserved host on Maundy\r\nThursday[90].\r\n\r\nI now return to the _Quem quaeritis_ in the second stage of its\r\nevolution, when it had ceased to be an _Introit_ trope and had become\r\nattached to the ceremony of the sepulchre. Obviously it is not an\r\nessential part of that ceremony. The _Depositio_ and _Elevatio_ mutually\r\npresuppose each other and, together, are complete. For the dramatic\r\nperformance, as described by St. Ethelwold, the clergy, having removed\r\nthe cross at the beginning of Matins, revisited the empty sepulchre quite\r\nat the close of that service, after the third respond[91], between which\r\nand the normal ending of Matins, the _Te Deum_, the _Quem quaeritis_ was\r\nintercalated. The fact that the Maries bear censers instead of or in\r\naddition to the scriptural spices, suggests that this _Visitatio_ grew\r\nout of a custom of censing the sepulchre at the end of Matins as well as\r\nof Evensong[92]. But the _Visitatio_ could easily be omitted, and in fact\r\nit was omitted in many churches where the _Depositio_ and _Elevatio_ were\r\nin use. The Sarum books, for instance, do not in any way prescribe it.\r\nOn the other hand, there were probably a few churches which adopted the\r\n_Visitatio_ without the more important rite. Bamberg seems to have been\r\none of these, and so possibly were Sens, Senlis, and one or two others\r\nin which the _Quem quaeritis_ is noted as taking place at an altar[93].\r\nHowever, whether there was a real sepulchre or not, the regular place\r\nof the _Quem quaeritis_ was that prescribed for it by St. Ethelwold,\r\nbetween the third respond and the _Te Deum_ at Matins. It has been found\r\nin a very large number of manuscripts, and in by far the greater part\r\nof them it occupies this position[94]. In the rest, with the exception\r\nof a completely anomalous example from Vienne[95], it is either a\r\ntrope[96], or else is merged with or immediately follows the _Elevatio_\r\nbefore Matins[97]. The evidence of the texts themselves is borne out by\r\nDurandus, who is aware of the variety of custom, and indicates the end of\r\nMatins as the _proprior locus_[98].\r\n\r\nNo less difficult to determine than the place and time at which the\r\nEaster sepulchre itself was devised, are those at which the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_, attached to it, stood forth as a drama. That the two first\r\nappear together can hardly be taken as evidence that they came into\r\nbeing together. The predominance of German and French versions of the\r\n_Quem quaeritis_ may suggest an origin in the Frankish area: and if\r\nthe influence of the Sarum use and the havoc of service-books at the\r\nReformation may between them help to account for the comparative rarity\r\nof the play in these islands, no such explanation is available for Italy\r\nand Spain. The development of the religious drama in the peninsulas,\r\nespecially in Italy, seems to have followed from the beginning lines\r\nsomewhat distinct from those of north-western Europe. But between France\r\nand Germany, as between France and England, literary influences, so far\r\nas clerkly literature goes, moved freely: nor is it possible to isolate\r\nthe centres and lines of diffusion of that gradual process of accretion\r\nand development through which the _Quem quaeritis_ gave ever fuller and\r\nfuller expression to the dramatic instincts by which it was prompted. The\r\n_clerici vagantes_ were doubtless busy agents in carrying new motives\r\nand amplifications of the text from one church to another. Nor should it\r\nbe forgotten that, numerous as are the versions preserved, those which\r\nhave perished must have been more numerous still, so that, if all were\r\nbefore us, the apparent anomaly presented by the occurrence of identical\r\nfeatures in, for instance, the plays from Dublin and Fleury, and no\r\nothers, would not improbably be removed. The existence of this or that\r\nversion in the service-books of any one church must depend on divers\r\nconditions; the accidents of communication in the first place, and in\r\nthe second the laxity or austerity of governing bodies at various dates\r\nin the licensing or pruning of dramatic elaboration. The simplest texts\r\nare often found in the latest manuscripts, and it may be that because\r\ntheir simplicity gave no offence they were permitted to remain there. A\r\nStrassburg notice suggests that the ordering of the _Quem quaeritis_ was\r\na matter for the discretion of each individual parish, in independence of\r\nits diocesan use[99]; while the process of textual growth is illustrated\r\nby a Laon _Ordinarium_, in which an earlier version has been erased and\r\none more elaborate substituted[100].\r\n\r\nDisregarding, however, in the main the dates of the manuscripts, it is\r\neasy so to classify the available versions as to mark the course of a\r\ndevelopment which was probably complete by the middle of the twelfth and\r\ncertainly by the thirteenth century. This development affected both the\r\ntext and the dramatic interest of the play. The former is the slighter\r\nmatter and may be disposed of first[101].\r\n\r\nThe kernel of the whole thing is, of course, the old St. Gall trope,\r\nitself a free adaptation from the text of the Vulgate, and the few\r\nexamples in which this does not occur must be regarded as quite\r\nexceptional[102]. The earliest additions were taken from anthems, which\r\nalready had their place in the Easter services, and which in some\r\nmanuscripts of the Gregorian _Antiphonarium_ are grouped together as\r\nsuitable for insertion wherever may be desired[103]. So far the text\r\nkeeps fairly close to the words of Scripture, and even where the limits\r\nof the antiphonary are passed, the same rule holds good. In time,\r\nhowever, a freer dramatic handling partly establishes itself. Proses, and\r\neven metrical hymns, beginning as choral introductions, gradually usurp a\r\nplace in the dialogue, and in the latest versions the metrical character\r\nis very marked. By far the most important of these insertions is the\r\nfamous prose or sequence _Victimae paschali_, the composition of which\r\nby the monk Wipo of St. Gall can be pretty safely dated in the second\r\nquarter of the eleventh century[104]. It goes as follows:\r\n\r\n  ‘Victimae paschali laudes immolant Christiani.\r\n  agnus redemit oves, Christus innocens patri reconciliavit peccatores.\r\n  mors et vita duello conflixere mirando, dux vitae mortuus regnat vivus.\r\n  dic nobis, Maria, quid vidisti in via?\r\n  sepulchrum Christi viventis et gloriam vidi resurgentis;\r\n  angelicos testes, sudarium et vestes.\r\n  surrexit Christus, spes mea, praecedet suos in Galilaeam.\r\n  credendum est magis soli Mariae veraci, quam Iudaeorum turbae fallaci.\r\n  scimus Christum surrexisse a mortuis vere: tu nobis, victor, rex,\r\n    miserere.’\r\n\r\nOriginally written as an _Alleluia_ trope or sequence proper, a place\r\nwhich it still occupies in the reformed Tridentine liturgy[105], the\r\n_Victimae paschali_ cannot be shown to have made its way into the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_ until the thirteenth century[106]. But it occurs in about\r\na third of the extant versions, sometimes as a whole, sometimes with\r\nthe omission of the first three sentences, which obviously do not lend\r\nthemselves as well as the rest to dramatic treatment. When introduced,\r\nthese three sentences are sung either by the choir or by the Maries: the\r\nother six fall naturally into dialogue.\r\n\r\nThe _Victimae paschali_ is an expansion of the text of the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_, but it does not necessarily introduce any new dramatic\r\nmotive. Of such there were, from the beginning, at least two. There was\r\nthe visit of the Maries to the sepulchre and their colloquy with the\r\nangel; and there was the subsequent announcement of the Resurrection made\r\nby them in pursuance of the divine direction. Each has its appropriate\r\naction: in the one case the lifting of the pall and discovery of\r\nthe empty sepulchre, in the other the display by the Maries of the\r\ncast-off grave-clothes, represented by a _linteum_, in token of the\r\njoyful event. It is to this second scene, if the term may be used of\r\nanything so rudimentary, that the _Victimae paschali_ attaches itself.\r\nThe dialogue of it is between the Maries and the choir, who stand for\r\nthe whole body of disciples, or sometimes two singers, who are their\r\nspokesmen[107]. A new scene is, however, clearly added to the play,\r\nwhen these two singers not only address the Maries, but themselves pay a\r\nvisit to the sepulchre. Now they represent the apostles Peter and John.\r\nIn accordance with the gospel narrative John outstrips Peter in going\r\nto the sepulchre, but Peter enters first: and the business of taking\r\nup the _linteum_ and displaying it to the other disciples is naturally\r\ntransferred to them from the Maries. The apostle scene first makes its\r\nappearance in an Augsburg text of the end of the eleventh century, or the\r\nbeginning of the twelfth[108]. It occurs in rather more than half the\r\ntotal number of versions. These are mainly German, but the evidence of\r\nBelethus is sufficient to show that it was not unknown in twelfth-century\r\nFrance[109]. The addition of the apostle scene completed the evolution\r\nof the Easter play for the majority of churches. There were, however, a\r\nfew in which the very important step was taken of introducing the person\r\nof the risen Christ himself; and this naturally entailed yet another new\r\nscene. Of this type there are fifteen extant versions, coming from one\r\nItalian, four French, and four German churches[110]. The earliest is of\r\nthe twelfth century, from a Prague convent. The new scene closely follows\r\nthe Scripture narrative. Mary Magdalen remains behind the other Maries\r\nat the sepulchre. The Christ appears; she takes him for the gardener, and\r\nhe reveals himself with the _Noli me tangere_. Mary returns with the new\r\nwonder to the choir. This is the simplest version of the new episode. It\r\noccurs in a play of which the text is purely liturgical, and does not\r\neven include the _Victimae paschali_. A somewhat longer one is found in\r\na Fleury play, which is in other respects highly elaborate and metrical.\r\nHere the Christ appears twice, first disguised _in similitudinem\r\nhortolani_, afterwards _in similitudinem domini_ with the _labarum_ or\r\nresurrection banner. The remaining versions do not depart widely from\r\nthese two types, except that at Rouen and Mont St.-Michel, the Christ\r\nscene takes place, not at the sepulchre but at the altar, and at Cividale\r\nin a spot described as the _ortus Christi_[111].\r\n\r\nThe formal classification, then, of the versions of the _Quem quaeritis_,\r\ngives three types. In the first, the scenes between the Maries and the\r\nangel, and between the Maries and the choir, are alone present; in the\r\nsecond the apostle scene is added to these; the third, of which there\r\nare only fifteen known examples, is distinguished by the presence of the\r\nChrist scene. In any one of these types, the _Victimae paschali_ and\r\nother proses and hymns may or may not be found[112]. And it must now\r\nbe added that it is on the presence of these that the greater or less\r\ndevelopment of lyric feeling, as distinct from dramatic action, in the\r\nplay depends. The metrical hymns in particular, when they are not merely\r\nchoral overtures, are often of the nature of _planctus_ or laments put\r\nin the mouths of the Maries as they approach the sepulchre or at some\r\nother appropriate moment. These _planctus_ add greatly to the vividness\r\nand humanity of the play, and are thus an important step in the dramatic\r\nevolution. The use of them may be illustrated by that of the hymn _Heu!\r\npius pastor occiditur_ in the Dublin version found by Mr. Frere and\r\nprinted, after a different text from his, in an appendix[113]. This play\r\nhas not the Christ scene, and belongs, therefore, to the second type of\r\n_Quem quaeritis_, but, in other respects, including the _planctus_, it\r\nclosely resembles the Fleury version described above. Another _planctus_,\r\nfound in plays of the third type from Engelberg, Nuremberg, Einsiedeln,\r\nand Cividale, is the _Heu nobis! internas mentes_[114]; a third, the\r\n_Heu! miserae cur contigit_, seems to have been interpolated in the _Heu!\r\npius pastor_ at Dublin; a fourth, the _Omnipotens pater altissime_, with\r\na refrain _Heu quantus est dolor noster!_ is found at places so far apart\r\nas Narbonne and Prague[115]: and a fifth, _Heu dolor, heu quam dira\r\ndoloris angustia!_ is also in the Fleury text[116].\r\n\r\nAnother advance towards drama is made in four Prague versions of the\r\nthird type by the introduction of an episode for which there is no\r\nScriptural basis at all. On their way to the sepulchre, the Maries stop\r\nand buy the necessary spices of a spice-merchant or _unguentarius_. In\r\nthree thirteenth-century texts the _unguentarius_ is merely a _persona\r\nmuta_; in one of the fourteenth he is given four lines[117]. The\r\n_unguentarius_ was destined to become a very popular character, and to\r\nafford much comic relief in the vernacular religious drama of Germany.\r\nNor can it be quite confidently said that his appearance in these\r\ncomparatively late liturgical plays is a natural development and not\r\nmerely an instance of reaction by the vernacular stage.\r\n\r\nThe scenic effect of the _Quem quaeritis_ can be to some extent gathered\r\nfrom the rubrics, although these are often absent and often not very\r\nexplicit, being content with a general direction for the performers to\r\nbe arrayed _in similitudinem mulierum_ or _angelorum_ or _apostolorum_,\r\nas the case may be. The setting was obviously simple, and few properties\r\nor costumes beyond what the vestments and ornaments of the church could\r\nsupply were used. The Maries had their heads veiled[118], and wore\r\nsurplices, copes, chasubles, dalmatics, albs, or the like. These were\r\neither white or coloured. At Fécamp one, presumably the Magdalen, was\r\nin red, the other two in white[119]. The thuribles which, as already\r\npointed out, they carried, were sometimes replaced by boxes or vases\r\nrepresenting the ointment and spices[120]. Sometimes also they carried,\r\nor had carried before them, candles. Two or three rubrics direct them to\r\ngo _pedetemptim_, as sad or searching[121]. They were generally three\r\nin number, occasionally two, or one only. The angels, or angel, as the\r\ncase might be, sat within the sepulchre or at its door. They, too, had\r\nvestments, generally white, and veiled or crowned heads. At Narbonne, and\r\nprobably elsewhere, they had wings[122]. They held lights, a palm, or an\r\near of corn, symbolizing the Resurrection[123]. The apostles are rarely\r\ndescribed; the ordinary priestly robes doubtless sufficed. At Dublin,\r\nSt. John, in white, held a palm, and St. Peter, in red, the keys[124].\r\nIn the earliest Prague version of the Christ scene, the Christ seems to\r\nbe represented by one of the angels[125]. At Nuremberg the _dominica\r\npersona_ has a crown and bare feet[126]. At Rouen he holds a cross, and\r\nthough there is a double appearance, there is no hint of any change of\r\ncostume[127]. But at Coutances and Fleury the first appearance is as\r\n_hortulanus_, indicated perhaps by a spade, which is exchanged on the\r\nsecond for the cross[128].\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the _Quem quaeritis_ remained imperfectly\r\ndetached from the liturgy, out of which it arose. The performers were\r\npriests, or nuns, and choir-boys. The play was always chanted, not\r\nspoken[129]. It was not even completely resolved into dialogue. In many\r\nquite late versions narrative anthems giving the gist of each scene are\r\nretained, and are sung either by the principal actors or by the choir,\r\nwhich thus, as in the hymns or proses which occur as overtures[130],\r\nholds a position distinct from the part which it takes as representing\r\nthe disciples[131]. Finally the whole performance ends in most cases with\r\nthe _Te Deum laudamus_, and thus becomes a constituent part of Matins,\r\nwhich normally comes to a close with that hymn. The intervention of the\r\ncongregation, with its Easter hymn _Christ ist erstanden_, seems to lie\r\noutside the main period of the evolution of the _Quem quaeritis_. I only\r\nfind one example so early as the thirteenth century[132]. It is in quite\r\nlate texts also that certain other Easter motives have become attached to\r\nthe play. The commonest of these are the whispered greeting of _Surrexit\r\nChristus_ and the kiss of peace, which have been noted elsewhere as\r\npreceding Matins[133]. At Eichstädt, in 1560, is an amusing direction,\r\nwhich Mr. Collins would have thought very proper, that the _pax_ is to be\r\ngiven to the _dominus terrae, si ibi fuerit_, before the priest. The same\r\nmanuscript shows a curious combination of the _Quem quaeritis_ with the\r\nirrepressible _Tollite portas_ ceremony[134]. Another such is found at\r\nVenice[135]. But this is as late as the eighteenth century, to which also\r\nbelongs the practice at Angers described by De Moleon, according to which\r\nthe Maries took up from the sepulchre with the _linteum_ two large Easter\r\neggs—_deux œufs d’autruche_[136].\r\n\r\nBesides the _Quem quaeritis_, Easter week had another liturgical drama\r\nin the _Peregrini_ or _Peregrinus_[137]. This was established by the\r\ntwelfth century. It was regularly played at Lichfield[138], but no text\r\nis extant from England, except a late transitional one, written partly\r\nin the vernacular[139]. France affords four texts, from Saintes[140],\r\nRouen[141], Beauvais[142], and Fleury[143]. The play is also recorded\r\nat Lille[144]. In Germany it is represented by a recently-discovered\r\nfragment of the famous early thirteenth-century repertory of the\r\n_scholares vagantes_ from the Benedictbeuern monastery[145]. The simplest\r\nversion is that of Saintes, in which the action is confined to the\r\njourney to Emmaus and the supper there. The Rouen play is on the same\r\nlines, but at the close the disciples are joined by St. Mary Magdalen,\r\nand the _Victimae paschali_ is sung. The Benedictbeuern play similarly\r\nends with the introduction of the Virgin and two other Maries to greet\r\nthe risen Christ. But here, and in the Beauvais and Fleury plays, a\r\ndistinct scene is added, of which the subject is the incredulity of\r\nThomas and the apparition to him. It is, I think, a reasonable conjecture\r\nthat the _Peregrini_, in which the risen Christ is a character, was not\r\ndevised until he had already been introduced into the later versions of\r\nthe _Quem quaeritis_. Indeed the Fleury _Peregrini_, with its double\r\nappearance and change of costume for Christ, seems clearly modelled on\r\nthe Fleury _Quem quaeritis_. But the lesser play has its own proper\r\nand natural place in the Easter week services. It is attached to the\r\n_Processio ad fontes_ which is a regular portion, during that season, of\r\nVespers[146]. The Christ with the Resurrection cross is personated by the\r\npriest who normally accompanies the procession _cum cruce_. At Rouen\r\nthe play was a kind of dramatization of the procession itself[147]; at\r\nLille it seems to have had the same position; at Saintes and Beauvais it\r\npreceded the _Magnificat_ and _Oratio_ or _Collecta_, after which the\r\nprocession started. In the remaining cases there is no indication of the\r\nexact time for the _Peregrini_. The regular day for it appears to have\r\nbeen the Monday in Easter week, of the Gospel for which the journey to\r\nEmmaus is the subject; but at Fleury it was on the Tuesday, when the\r\nGospel subject is the incredulity of Thomas. At Saintes, a curious rubric\r\ndirects the Christ during the supper at Emmaus to divide the ‘host’ among\r\nthe _Peregrini_. It seems possible that in this way a final disposal was\r\nfound for the host which had previously figured in the _Depositio_ and\r\n_Elevatio_ of the sepulchre ceremony.\r\n\r\nA long play, probably of Norman origin and now preserved in a manuscript\r\nat Tours, represents a merging of the _Elevatio_, the _Quem quaeritis_,\r\nand the _Peregrini_[148]. The beginning is imperfect, but it may be\r\nconjectured from a fragment belonging to Klosterneuburg in Germany, that\r\nonly a few lines are lost[149]. Pilate sets a watch before the sepulchre.\r\nAn angel sends lightning, and the soldiers fall as if dead[150].\r\nThen come the Maries, with _planctus_. There is a scene with the\r\n_unguentarius_ or _mercator_, much longer than that at Prague, followed\r\nby more _planctus_. After the _Quem quaeritis_, the soldiers announce\r\nthe event to Pilate. A _planctus_ by the Magdalen leads up to the\r\napparition to her. The Maries return to the disciples. Christ appears to\r\nthe disciples, then to Thomas, and the _Victimae paschali_ and _Te Deum_\r\nconclude the performance. A fragment of a very similar play, breaking off\r\nbefore the _Quem quaeritis_, belongs to the Benedictbeuern manuscript\r\nalready mentioned[151].\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the rubrics that the Tours play, long as it is, was\r\nstill acted in church, and probably, as the _Te Deum_ suggests, at the\r\nEaster Matins[152]. Certainly this was the case with the Benedictbeuern\r\nplay. In a sense, these plays only mark a further stage in the process\r\nof elaboration by which the fuller versions of the _Quem quaeritis_\r\nproper came into being. But the introduction at the beginning and end\r\nof motives outside the events of the Easter morning itself points to\r\npossibilities of expansion which were presently realized, and which\r\nultimately transformed the whole character of the liturgical drama.\r\nAll the plays, however, which have so far been mentioned, are strictly\r\nplays of the Resurrection. Their action begins after the Burial of\r\nChrist, and does not stretch back into the events of the Passion. Nor\r\nindeed can the liturgical drama proper be shown to have advanced beyond\r\na very rudimentary representation of the Passion. This began with the\r\n_planctus_, akin to those of the _Quem quaeritis_, which express the\r\nsorrows of the Virgin and the Maries and St. John around the cross[153].\r\nSuch _planctus_ exist both in Latin and the vernacular. The earliest\r\nare of the twelfth century. Several of them are in dialogue, in which\r\nChrist himself occasionally takes part, and they appear to have been\r\nsung in church after Matins on Good Friday[154]. The _planctus_ must\r\nbe regarded as the starting-point of a drama of the Passion, which\r\npresently established itself beside the drama of the Resurrection. This\r\nprocess was mainly outside the churches, but an early and perhaps still\r\nliturgical stage of it is to be seen in the _ludus breviter de passione_\r\nwhich precedes the elaborated _Quem quaeritis_ of the Benedictbeuern\r\nmanuscript, and was probably treated as a sort of prologue to it. The\r\naction extends from the preparation for the Last Supper to the Burial. It\r\nis mainly in dumb-show, and the slight dialogue introduced is wholly out\r\nof the Vulgate. But at one point occurs the rubric _Maria planctum faciat\r\nquantum melius potest_, and a later hand has inserted out of its place in\r\nthe text the most famous of all the laments of the Virgin, the _Planctus\r\nante nescia_[155].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nLITURGICAL PLAYS (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ‘Twelve days’ of the Christmas season are no less important than\r\nEaster itself in the evolution of the liturgical drama. I have mentioned\r\nin the last chapter a Christmas trope which is evidently based upon\r\nthe older Easter dialogue. Instead of _Quem quaeritis in sepulchro,\r\no Christicolae?_ it begins _Quem quaeritis in praesepe, pastores,\r\ndicite?_ It occurs in eleventh- and twelfth-century tropers from St.\r\nGall, Limoges, St. Magloire, and Nevers. Originally it was an _Introit_\r\ntrope for the third or ‘great’ Mass. In a fifteenth-century breviary\r\nfrom Clermont-Ferrand it has been transferred to Matins, where it\r\nfollows the _Te Deum_; and this is precisely the place in the Christmas\r\nservices occupied, at Rouen, by a liturgical drama known as the _Officium\r\nPastorum_, which appears to have grown out of the _Quem quaeritis in\r\npraesepe?_ by a process analogous to that by which the Easter drama\r\ngrew out of the _Quem quaeritis in sepulchro[156]?_ A _praesepe_ or\r\n‘crib,’ covered by a curtain, was made ready behind the altar, and in\r\nit was placed an image of the Virgin. After the _Te Deum_ five canons\r\nor vicars, representing the shepherds, approached the great west door\r\nof the choir. A boy _in similitudinem angeli_ perched _in excelso_ sang\r\nthem the ‘good tidings,’ and a number of others _in voltis ecclesiae_\r\ntook up the _Gloria in excelsis_. The shepherds, singing a hymn, advanced\r\nto the _praesepe_. Here they were met with the _Quem quaeritis_ by two\r\npriests _quasi obstetrices_[157]. The dialogue of the trope, expanded\r\nby another hymn during which the shepherds adore, follows, and so the\r\ndrama ends. But the shepherds ‘rule the choir’ throughout the _Missa in\r\nGallicantu_ immediately afterwards, and at Lauds, the anthem for which\r\nmuch resembles the _Quem quaeritis_ itself[158]. The _misterium pastorum_\r\nwas still performed at Rouen in the middle of the fifteenth century, and\r\nat this date the shepherds, _cessantibus stultitiis et insolenciis_, so\r\nfar as this could be ensured by the chapter, took the whole ‘service’\r\nof the day, just as did the deacons, priests, and choir-boys during the\r\n_triduum_[159].\r\n\r\nIf the central point of the _Quem quaeritis_ is the _sepulchrum_, that\r\nof the _Pastores_ is the _praesepe_. In either case the drama, properly\r\nso called, is an addition, and by no means an invariable one, to the\r\nsymbolical ceremony. The _Pastores_ may, in fact, be described, although\r\nthe term does not occur in the documents, as a _Visitatio praesepis_.\r\nThe history of the _praesepe_ can be more definitely stated than that\r\nof the _sepulchrum_. It is by no means extinct. The Christmas ‘crib’\r\nor _crèche_, a more or less realistic representation of the Nativity,\r\nwith a Christ-child in the manger, a Joseph and Mary, and very often\r\nan ox and an ass, is a common feature in all Catholic countries at\r\nChristmas time[160]. At Rome, in particular, the _esposizione del santo\r\nbambino_ takes place with great ceremony[161]. A tradition ascribes\r\nthe first _presepio_ known in Italy to St. Francis, who is said to\r\nhave invented it at Greccio in 1223[162]. But this is a mistake. The\r\ncustom is many centuries older than St. Francis. Its Roman home is\r\nthe church of S. Maria Maggiore or _Ad Praesepe_, otherwise called\r\nthe ‘_basilica_ of Liberius.’ Here there was in the eighth century a\r\npermanent _praesepe_[163], probably built in imitation of one which had\r\nlong existed at Bethlehem, and to which an allusion is traced in the\r\nwritings of Origen[164]. The _praesepe_ of S. Maria Maggiore was in the\r\nright aisle. When the Sistine chapel was built in 1585-90 it was moved\r\nto the crypt, where it may now be seen. This church became an important\r\nstation for the Papal services at Christmas. The Pope celebrated Mass\r\nhere on the vigil, and remained until he had also celebrated the first\r\nMass on Christmas morning. The bread was broken on the manger itself,\r\nwhich served as an altar. At S. Maria Maggiore, moreover, is an important\r\nrelic, in some boards from the _culla_ or cradle of Christ, which are\r\nexposed on the _presepio_ during Christmas[165]. The _presepio_ of S.\r\nMaria Maggiore became demonstrably the model for other similar chapels\r\nin Rome[166], and doubtless for the more temporary structures throughout\r\nItaly and western Europe in general.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge it is a little difficult to\r\nbe precise as to the range or date of the _Pastores_. The only full\r\nmediaeval Latin text, other than that of Rouen, which has come to light,\r\nis also of Norman origin, and is still unprinted[167]. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury the play survived at Lisieux and Clermont[168]. The earliest\r\nRouen manuscript is of the thirteenth century, and the absence of any\r\nreference to the _Officium Pastorum_ by John of Avranches, who writes\r\nprimarily of Rouen, and who does mention the _Officium Stellae_, makes\r\nit probable that it was not there known about 1070[169]. Its existence,\r\nhowever, in England in the twelfth century is shown by the Lichfield\r\n_Statutes_ of 1188-98, and on the whole it is not likely to have taken\r\nshape later than the eleventh. Very likely it never, as a self-contained\r\nplay, acquired the vogue of the _Quem quaeritis_. As will be seen\r\npresently, it was overshadowed and absorbed by rivals. I find no trace of\r\nit in Germany, where the _praesepe_ became a centre, less for liturgical\r\ndrama, than for carols, dances, and ‘crib-rocking[170].’\r\n\r\nStill rarer than the _Pastores_ is the drama, presumably belonging to\r\nInnocents’ day, of _Rachel_. It is found in a primitive form, hardly more\r\nthan a trope, in a Limoges manuscript of the eleventh century. Here it is\r\ncalled _Lamentatio Rachel_, and consists of a short _planctus_ by Rachel\r\nherself, and a short reply by a consoling angel. There is nothing to show\r\nwhat place it occupied in the services[171].\r\n\r\nThe fact is that both the _Pastores_ and the _Rachel_ were in many\r\nchurches taken up into a third drama belonging to the Epiphany. This\r\nis variously known as the _Tres Reges_, the _Magi_, _Herodes_, and\r\nthe _Stella_. It exists in a fair number of different but related\r\nforms. Like the _Quem quaeritis_ and the _Pastores_, it had a material\r\nstarting-point, in the shape of a star, lit with candles, which hung\r\nfrom the roof of the church, and could sometimes be moved, by a\r\nsimple mechanical device, from place to place[172]. As with the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_, the development of the _Stella_ must be studied without much\r\nreference to the relative age of the manuscripts in which it happens\r\nto be found. But it was probably complete by the end of the eleventh\r\ncentury, since manuscripts of that date contain the play in its latest\r\nforms[173].\r\n\r\nThe simplest version is from Limoges[174]. The three kings enter by the\r\ngreat door of the choir singing a _prosula_. They show their gifts, the\r\nroyal gold, the divine incense, the myrrh for funeral. Then they see the\r\nstar, and follow it to the high altar. Here they offer their gifts, each\r\ncontained in a gilt cup, or some other _iocale pretiosum_, after which a\r\nboy, representing an angel, announces to them the birth of Christ, and\r\nthey retire singing to the sacristy. The text of this version stands\r\nby itself: nearly all the others are derived from a common tradition,\r\nwhich is seen in its simplest form at Rouen[175]. In the Rouen _Officium\r\nStellae_, the three kings, coming respectively from the east, north, and\r\nsouth of the church, meet before the altar. One of them points to the\r\nstar with his stick, and they sing:\r\n\r\n  ‘1. Stella fulgore nimio rutilat,\r\n   2. Quae regem regum natum demonstrat\r\n   3. Quem venturum olim prophetiae signaverant.’\r\n\r\nThey kiss each other and sing an anthem, which occurs also in the Limoges\r\nversion: _Eamus ergo et inquiramus eum, offerentes ei munera; aurum thus\r\net myrrham._ A procession is now formed, and as it moves towards the\r\nnave, the choir chant narrative passages, describing the visit of the\r\n_Magi_ to Jerusalem and their reception by Herod. Meanwhile a star is lit\r\nover the altar of the cross where an image of the Virgin has been placed.\r\nThe _Magi_ approach it, singing the passage which begins _Ecce stella in\r\nOriente_. They are met by two in dalmatics, who appear to be identical\r\nwith the _obstetrices_ of the Rouen _Pastores_. A dialogue follows:\r\n\r\n    ‘Qui sunt hi qui, stella duce, nos adeuntes inaudita ferunt.\r\n\r\n    _Magi respondeant_:\r\n\r\n    nos sumus, quos cernitis, reges Tharsis et Arabum et Saba, dona\r\n    ferentes Christo, regi nato, Domino, quem, stella deducente,\r\n    adorare venimus.\r\n\r\n    _Tunc duo Dalmaticati aperientes cortinam dicant_:\r\n\r\n    ecce puer adest quem queritis, Iam properate adorate, quia ipse\r\n    est redemptio mundi.\r\n\r\n    _Tunc procidentes Reges ad terram, simul salutent puerum, ita\r\n    dicentes_:\r\n\r\n    salve, princeps saeculorum.\r\n\r\n    _Tunc unus a suo famulo aurum accipiat et dicat_:\r\n\r\n    suscipe, rex, aurum.\r\n\r\n    _Et offerat._\r\n\r\n    _Secundus ita dicat et offerat_:\r\n\r\n    tolle thus, tu, vere Deus.\r\n\r\n    _Tercius ita dicat et offerat_:\r\n\r\n    mirram, signum sepulturae.’\r\n\r\nThen the congregation make their oblations. Meanwhile the _Magi_ pray and\r\nfall asleep. In their sleep an angel warns them to return home another\r\nway. The procession returns up a side aisle to the choir; and the Mass,\r\nin which the _Magi_, like the shepherds on Christmas day, ‘rule the\r\nchoir,’ follows.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the difference of text the incidents of the Rouen and Limoges\r\nversions, except for the angelic warning introduced at Rouen, are the\r\nsame. There was a dramatic advance when the visit to Jerusalem, instead\r\nof being merely narrated by the choir, was inserted into the action.\r\nIn the play performed at Nevers[176], Herod himself, destined in the\r\nfullness of time to become the protagonist of the Corpus Christi stage,\r\nmakes his first appearance. There are two versions of the Nevers play. In\r\nthe earlier the new scene is confined to a colloquy between Herod and the\r\n_Magi_:\r\n\r\n    ‘[_Magi._] Vidimus stellam eius in Oriente, et agnovimus regem\r\n    regum esse natum.\r\n\r\n    [_Herodes._] regem quem queritis natum stella quo signo\r\n    didicistis? Si illum regnare creditis, dicite nobis.\r\n\r\n    [_Magi._] illum natum esse didicimus in Oriente stella\r\n    monstrante.\r\n\r\n    [_Herodes._] ite et de puero diligenter investigate, et\r\n    inventum redeuntes mihi renuntiate.’\r\n\r\nThe later version adds two further episodes. In one a _nuntius_ announces\r\nthe coming of the _Magi_, and is sent to fetch them before Herod: in the\r\nother Herod sends his courtiers for the scribes, who find a prophecy of\r\nthe birth of the Messiah in Bethlehem. Obviously the Herod scene gives\r\npoint to the words at the end of the Rouen play, in which the angel bids\r\nthe _Magi_ to return home by a different way.\r\n\r\nAt Compiègne the action closes with yet another scene, in which Herod\r\nlearns that the _Magi_ have escaped him[177].\r\n\r\n    ‘_Nuncius._ Delusus es domine, magi viam redierunt aliam.\r\n\r\n    [_Herodes._ incendium meum ruina extinguam[178].]\r\n\r\n    _Armiger._ decerne, domine, vindicari iram tuam, et stricto\r\n    mucrone quaerere iube puerum, forte inter occisos occidetur et\r\n    ipse.\r\n\r\n    _Herodes._ indolis eximiae pueros fac ense perire.\r\n\r\n    _Angelus._ sinite parvulos venire ad me, talium est enim regnum\r\n    caelorum.’\r\n\r\nIn a Norman version which has the same incidents as the Compiègne play,\r\nbut in parts a different text, the _armiger_ is the son of Herod, and\r\nthe play ends with Herod taking a sword from a bystander and brandishing\r\nit in the air[179]. Already he is beginning to tear a passion to tatters\r\nin the manner that became traditionally connected with his name. Another\r\npeculiarity of this Norman version is that the _Magi_ address Herod in an\r\noutlandish jargon, which seems to contain fragments of Hebrew and Arabic\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThe play of the _Stella_ must now, perhaps, be considered, except so far\r\nas mere amplifications of the text are concerned, strictly complete. But\r\nanother step was irresistibly suggested by the course it had taken. The\r\nmassacre of the Innocents, although it lay outside the range of action in\r\nwhich the _Magi_ themselves figured, could be not merely threatened but\r\nactually represented. This was done at Laon[180]. The cruel suggestion\r\nof Archelaus is carried out. The Innocents come in singing and bearing a\r\nlamb. They are slain, and the play ends with a dialogue, like that of the\r\ndistinct Limoges _planctus_, between the lamenting Rachel and an angelic\r\n_consolatrix_.\r\n\r\nThe absorption of the motives proper to other feasts of the Twelve nights\r\ninto the Epiphany play has clearly begun. A fresh series of examples\r\nshows a similar treatment of the _Pastores_. At Strassburg the _Magi_, as\r\nthey leave Herod, meet the shepherds returning from Bethlehem:\r\n\r\n  ‘Pastores, dicite, quidnam vidistis?\r\n  infantem vidimus.’\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not taken from the _Pastores_ itself, but from the\r\nChristmas Lauds antiphon[181]. Its dramatic use may be compared with that\r\nof the _Victimae paschali_ in the _Quem quaeritis_. In versions from\r\nBilsen[182] near Liège and from Mans[183], on the other hand, although\r\nthe meeting of the _Magi_ and the shepherds is retained, a complete\r\n_Pastores_, with the angelic tidings and the adoration at the _praesepe_,\r\nforms the first part of the office, before the _Magi_ are introduced at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe Strassburg, Bilsen, and Mans plays have not the _Rachel_, although\r\nthe first two have the scene in which the _nuntius_ informs Herod\r\nthat the _Magi_ have deceived him. A further stage is reached when,\r\nas at Freising and at Fleury, the _Pastores_, _Stella_ and _Rachel_\r\nall coalesce in a single, and by this time considerable, drama. The\r\nFreising texts, of which there are two, are rather puzzling[184]. The\r\nfirst closely resembles the plays of the group just described. It begins\r\nwith a short _Pastores_, comprising the angelic tidings only. Then the\r\nscenes between the _Magi_ and Herod are treated at great length. The\r\nmeeting of the _Magi_ and the shepherds is followed by the oblation,\r\nthe angelic warning, and the return of the messenger to Herod. In the\r\nsecond Freising text, which is almost wholly metrical, the _Pastores_\r\nis complete. It is followed by a quite new scene, the dream of Joseph\r\nand his flight into Egypt. Then come successively the scene of fury at\r\ncourt, the massacre, the _planctus_ and consolation of Rachel. Clearly\r\nthis second text, as it stands, is incomplete. The _Magi_ are omitted,\r\nand the whole of the latter part of the play is consequently rendered\r\nmeaningless. But it is the _Magi_ who are alone treated fully in the\r\nfirst Freising text. I suggest, therefore, that the second text is\r\nintended to supplement and not to replace the first. It really comprises\r\ntwo fragments: one a revision of the _Pastores_, the other a revision of\r\nthe closing scene and an expansion of it by a _Rachel_.\r\n\r\nAs to the Fleury version there can be no doubt whatever[185]. The matter\r\nis, indeed, arranged in two plays, a _Herodes_ and an _Interfectio\r\nPuerorum_, each ending with a _Te Deum_; and the performance may possibly\r\nhave extended over two days. But the style is the same throughout and\r\nthe episodes form one continuous action. It is impossible to regard the\r\n_Interfectio Puerorum_ as a separate piece from the _Herodes_, acted a\r\nweek earlier on the feast of the Innocents; for into it, after the first\r\nentry of the children with their lamb, _gaudentes per monasterium_,\r\ncome the flight into Egypt, the return of the _nuntius_, and the wrath\r\nof Herod, which, of course, presuppose the _Magi_ scenes. Another new\r\nincident is added at the end of the Fleury play. Herod is deposed and\r\nArchelaus set up; the Holy Family return from Egypt, and settle in the\r\nparts of Galilee[186].\r\n\r\nI have attempted to arrange the dozen or so complete Epiphany plays known\r\nto scholars in at least the logical order of their development. There\r\nare also three fragments, which fit readily enough into the system. Two,\r\nfrom a Paris manuscript and from Einsiedeln, may be classed respectively\r\nwith the Compiègne and Strassburg texts[187]. The third, from Vienne,\r\nis an independent version, in leonine hexameters, of the scene in which\r\nthe _Magi_ first sight the star, a theme common to all the plays except\r\nthat of Limoges[188]. I do not feel certain that this fragment is from a\r\nliturgical drama at all.\r\n\r\nThe textual development of the _Stella_ is closely parallel to that of\r\nthe _Quem quaeritis_. The more primitive versions consist of antiphons\r\nand prose sentences based upon or in the manner of the Scriptures. The\r\nlater ones, doubtless under the influence of wandering scholars, become\r\nincreasingly metrical. The classical tags, from Sallust and Virgil, are\r\nan obvious note of the scholarly pen. With the exception of that from\r\nLimoges, all the texts appear to be derived by successive accretions and\r\nmodifications from an archetype fairly represented at Rouen. The Bilsen\r\ntext and the Vienne fragment have been freely rewritten, and the process\r\nof rewriting is well illustrated by the alternative versions found\r\nside by side in the later Nevers manuscript. With regard to the place\r\noccupied by the _Stella_ in the Epiphany services, such manuscripts as\r\ngive any indications at all seem to point to a considerable divergence\r\nof local use. At Limoges and Nevers, the play was of the nature of a\r\ntrope to the Mass, inserted in the former case at the _Offertorium_,\r\nin the latter at the _Communio_[189]. At Rouen the _Officium_ followed\r\nTierce, and preceded the ordinary procession before Mass. At Fleury the\r\nuse of the _Te Deum_ suggests that it was at Matins; at Strassburg it\r\nfollowed the _Magnificat_ at Vespers, but on the octave of Epiphany, not\r\nEpiphany itself. Perhaps the second part of the Fleury play was also on\r\nthe octave. At Bilsen the play followed the _Benedicamus_, but with this\r\nversicle nearly all the Hours end[190]. I do not, however, hesitate to\r\nsay that the Limoges use must have been the most primitive one. The\r\nkernel of the whole performance is a dramatized _Offertorium_. It was a\r\ncustom for Christian kings to offer gold and frankincense and myrrh at\r\nthe altar on Epiphany day[191]; and I take the play to have served as a\r\nsubstitute for this ceremony, where no king actually regnant was present.\r\n\r\nThere is yet one other liturgical play belonging to the Christmas season,\r\nwhich for the future development of the drama is the most important of\r\nall. This is the _Prophetae_[192]. It differs from the _Quem quaeritis_,\r\nthe _Peregrini_, the _Pastores_, and the _Stella_ by the large number\r\nof performers required, and by the epical mode of its composition. Its\r\norigin, in fact, is to be sought in a narrative, a _lectio_, not a chant.\r\nThe source was the pseudo-Augustinian _Sermo contra Iudaeos, Paganos\r\net Arianos de Symbolo_, probably written in the sixth century, but\r\nascribed throughout the Middle Ages to the great African[193]. A portion\r\nof this sermon was used in many churches as a lesson for some part or\r\nother of the Christmas offices[194]. The passage chosen is in a highly\r\nrhetorical vein. _Vos, inquam, convenio, O Iudaei_ cries the preacher,\r\nand calls upon the Jews to bear witness out of the mouths of their own\r\nprophets to the Christ. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Moses, David, Habakkuk,\r\nSimeon, Zacharias and Elisabeth, John the Baptist;—each in turn is\r\nbidden to speak, and each testimony is triumphantly quoted. Then: _Ecce,\r\nconvertimur ad gentes_. Virgil—_poeta facundissimus_—is pressed into the\r\nservice, for the famous line of his fourth eclogue:\r\n\r\n  ‘iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto[195],’\r\n\r\nNebuchadnezzar, who saw four walking in the furnace, and finally the\r\nErythraean Sibyl, whose acrostic verses on the ‘Signs of Judgement’ first\r\nappear in the writings of Eusebius[196].\r\n\r\nThe dramatic form of this _lectio_ possibly led to its being chanted\r\ninstead of read, and distributed between several voices in the manner\r\nof the Passions from Palm Sunday to Good Friday[197]. At any rate in\r\nthe eleventh century there appears in a Limoges manuscript a metrical\r\nadaptation in which it has been wholly converted into a dramatic\r\ndialogue[198]. This Limoges _Prophetae_ follows the sermon pretty closely\r\nin its arrangement. A _Precentor_ begins:\r\n\r\n  ‘Omnes gentes congaudentes, dent cantum laetitiae!\r\n  deus homo fit, de domo David, natus hodie.’\r\n\r\nHe addresses a couplet each _Ad Iudaeos_, _Ad Gentes_, and then calls\r\nin turn upon each of the prophets, who reply, Virgil pronouncing his\r\nline, the Sibyl the _Iudicii Signum_, and the others a couplet or\r\nquatrain apiece. They are nearly identical with the personages of the\r\nsermon: Israel is added, Zacharias disappears, and the order is slightly\r\ndifferent. Finally the _Precentor_ concludes:\r\n\r\n  ‘Iudaea incredula,\r\n  cur manens adhuc inverecunda?’\r\n\r\nTwo later versions, belonging respectively to Laon[199] and to\r\nRouen[200], diverge far more from the model. They are at much the same\r\nstage of development. In both the play is ushered in with the hymn\r\n_Gloriosi et famosi_, the verses of which are sung by the prophets, and\r\nthe refrain by the choir[201]. The costumes and symbols of the prophets\r\nare carefully indicated in the rubrics. The _Precentor_ of Limoges is\r\nrepresented by two singers, called at Laon _Appellatores_, and at Rouen\r\n_Vocatores_. The dialogue is amplified beyond that of Limoges. _Sex\r\nIudaei_ and _sex Gentiles_, for instance, take parts: and the _Vocatores_\r\ncomment with the choir in an identical form of words on each prophecy.\r\nThe Laon text is a good deal the shorter. The prophets are practically\r\nthe same as at Limoges, with one remarkable exception. At the end is\r\nintroduced Balaam, and to his prophecy is appended a miniature drama,\r\nwith the angel and the ass: thus—\r\n\r\n    ‘_Hic veniat Angelus cum gladio. Balaam tangit asinam, et illa\r\n    non praecedente, dicit iratus_:\r\n\r\n      quid moraris, asina,\r\n      obstinata bestia?\r\n      iam scindent calcaria\r\n      costas et praecordia.\r\n\r\n    _Puer sub asina respondet_:\r\n\r\n      angelus cum gladio,\r\n      quem adstare video,\r\n      prohibet ne transeam;\r\n      timeo ne peream.’\r\n\r\nThe Rouen text adds quite a number of prophets. The full list includes\r\nMoses, Amos, Isaiah, Aaron, Jeremiah, Daniel, Habakkuk, Balaam, Samuel,\r\nDavid, Hosea, Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Zephaniah, Haggai,\r\nZechariah, Ezekiel, Malachi, Zacharias, Elisabeth, John the Baptist,\r\nSimeon, Virgil, Nebuchadnezzar, and the Sibyl. In this version, also, the\r\npart of Balaam is expanded into a drama.\r\n\r\n    ‘_Duo missi a rege Balac dicant_:\r\n\r\n      Balaam, veni et fac.\r\n\r\n    _Tunc Balaam, ornatus, sedens super asinam, habens calcaria,\r\n    retineat lora et calcaribus percutiat asinam, et quidam\r\n    iuvenis, habens alas, tenens gladium, obstet asinae. Quidam sub\r\n    asina dicat_:\r\n\r\n      cur me cum calcaribus miseram sic laeditis.\r\n\r\n    _Hoc dicto, Angelus ei dicat_:\r\n\r\n      desine regis Balac praeceptum perficere.’\r\n\r\nHere, too, another little drama is similarly introduced. This is the\r\nstory of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, which, with an _imago_ for the\r\nbrethren to refuse to worship and a _fornax_ for them to be cast into,\r\nattaches itself to the _vocatio_ of Nebuchadnezzar.\r\n\r\nIn the Limoges manuscript the _Prophetae_ is followed by the words _Hic\r\ninchoant Benedicamus_[202]. As has been pointed out in the case of the\r\nBilsen _Pastores_, this is not conclusive as to the hour at which the\r\nperformance took place. The day was probably that of Christmas itself.\r\nBut even the day would naturally vary with the variable position of the\r\n_lectio_ out of which the _Prophetae_ grew. At Lincoln it was likewise\r\nChristmas day. But at Rouen the _processio asinorum_ was on Christmas\r\neve, and took the place of the ordinary festal procession after Tierce\r\nand before Mass[203]. And at St. Martin of Tours the _Prophetae_ was on\r\nNew Year’s day, performances being given both at Matins and Vespers[204].\r\n\r\nThe question naturally suggests itself: What was the relation of these\r\nliturgical plays of the Christmas season to the Feast of Fools and other\r\necclesiastical _ludi_ of the Twelve nights, which were discussed in the\r\nfirst volume? At Rouen, the _Prophetae_ received the name of _processio\r\nasinorum_ and took place at a _festum asinorum_, a name which we know to\r\nhave been elsewhere synonymous with _festum fatuorum_. At Tours, it was\r\nplayed at a reformed _festum novi anni_, with a Boy Bishop and at least\r\ntraces of expelled disorder. So, too, with the other plays. The Rouen\r\n_Pastores_ was infected by the fifteenth century with the _stultitiae\r\net insolentiae_ of the _triduum_. At Bilsen the _Stella_ was performed\r\nbefore a _rex_, who can hardly have been any other than a _rex fatuorum_\r\nof Epiphany. At Autun the _regnum Herodis_ was considered a Feast of\r\nFools[205]. Probably in both churches the _rex_ acted Herod in the\r\nplay. I think it must be taken for granted that the plays are the older\r\ninstitution of the two. They seem all to have taken shape by the eleventh\r\ncentury, before there is any clear sign that the Kalends had made their\r\nway into the churches and become the Feast of Fools. The plays may even\r\nhave been encouraged as a counter-attraction, for the congregation, to\r\nthe Kalends outside. On the other hand, I do not hold, as some writers\r\ndo, that the riotous Feasts of Asses were derived from the pious and\r\ninstructive ceremony so called at Rouen[206]. On the contrary, Balaam\r\nand his ass are an interpolation in the _Prophetae_ both at Rouen and,\r\nmore obviously, at Laon. Balaam, alone of the Laon performers, is not\r\nfrom the pseudo-Augustine sermon. Is he not, therefore, to be regarded\r\nas a reaction of the Feast of Fools upon the _Prophetae_, as an attempt\r\nto turn the established presence of the ass in the church to purposes of\r\nedification, rather than of ribaldry[207]? I think the explanation is\r\nthe more plausible one. And I find a parallel reaction of the turbulence\r\nof the Feast of Fools upon the _Stella_, in the violence of speech and\r\ngesture which permanently associated itself at a very early stage with\r\nthe character of Herod. The view here taken will be confirmed, when\r\nwe come to consider certain ecclesiastical criticisms passed upon the\r\nliturgical plays in the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nWhatever the exact relation of the divine and profane _ludi_ at Easter\r\nand Christmas may be, it seems to have been, in the main, at these two\r\ngreat seasons of festivity that what may be called the spontaneous growth\r\nof drama out of liturgy took place. There are yet a fair number of Latin\r\nplays to be spoken of which are in a sense liturgical. That is to say,\r\nthey were acted, certainly or probably, in churches and during intervals\r\nin the services. But of these such a spontaneous growth cannot be\r\nasserted, although it cannot also, in the present state of the evidence,\r\nbe confidently denied. Their metrical and literary style is parallel\r\nto that of the Easter and Christmas plays in the latest stages of\r\ndevelopment; and, until further data turn up, it is perhaps permissible\r\nto conjecture that they were deliberately composed on the model of the\r\n_Quem quaeritis_ and the _Stella_, when these had become widespread\r\nand popular. Indeed, some such derivation of the _Peregrini_ from the\r\n_Quem quaeritis_ and of the _Stella_ itself, at least in part, from the\r\n_Pastores_, has already appeared probable.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this new group of plays, we come, for the first and only\r\ntime, upon an individual author. As might be expected, this author is\r\na _scholaris vagans_, by name Hilarius. It would even be doing him no\r\ngreat injustice to call him a goliard. What little is known of Hilarius\r\nis gathered from his writings, which exist in a single manuscript. He\r\nmay have been an Englishman, for a large proportion of his verses are\r\naddressed to English folk. He was a pupil, about 1125, of the famous\r\nAbelard at his oratory of Paraclete in a desert near Nogent-sur-Seine.\r\nAfterwards he made his way to Angers. Many of his verses are of the\r\nfamiliar goliardic type, amorous and jocund; but amongst them are three\r\nplays[208]. Two of these are comparatively short, and contain each a few\r\nstanzas of French interspersed amongst the Latin. The subject of one is\r\na miracle wrought by St. Nicholas[209]; of the other, the _Suscitatio\r\nLazari_[210]. The third play, wholly in Latin, falls into two parts, and\r\ngives at considerable length the story of _Daniel_[211]. I take it that\r\nthese plays were not written for any church in particular, but represent\r\nthe repertory of a band of wandering clerks. At the end, both of the\r\n_Daniel_ and of the _Suscitatio Lazari_, is a rubric or stage-direction,\r\nto the effect that, if the performance is given at Matins, the _Te Deum_\r\nshould follow; if at Vespers, the _Magnificat_. Evidently the connexion\r\nwith the church service, so organic in the plays of the more primitive\r\ntype, has become for Hilarius almost accidental. As to the place of the\r\nplays in the calendar, the manuscript gives no indication, and probably\r\nHilarius and his friends would be willing enough to act them whenever\r\nthey got a chance. But the St. Nicholas play would come most naturally\r\non the day of that saint, December 6. The _Suscitatio Lazari_ would\r\nbe appropriate enough as an addition to the _Quem quaeritis_ and the\r\n_Peregrini_ in Easter week. The story is told, indeed, in the Gospel for\r\nFriday in the fourth week in Lent; but that does not seem a very likely\r\ndate for a play. The _Daniel_ perhaps grew, as we have seen a _Balaam_\r\nand a _Nebuchadnezzar_ growing, out of a _Prophetae_; and may have been a\r\nsubstitute for a _Prophetae_ at Christmas.\r\n\r\nThese dates are borne out, or not contradicted, by other similar plays,\r\nwhich have more of a local habitation. For no one of Hilarius’ three\r\nstands quite alone. Of Latin plays of St. Nicholas, indeed, quite a\r\nlittle group exists; and the great scholastic feast evidently afforded an\r\noccasion, less only than Easter and Christmas, for dramatic performances.\r\nThe earliest texts are from Germany. Two are found in a Hildesheim\r\nmanuscript of the eleventh century[212]; a third in an Einsiedeln\r\nmanuscript of the twelfth[213]. The thirteenth-century Fleury play-book\r\ncontains no less than four, two of which appear to be more developed\r\nforms of the Hildesheim plays. The theme is in every case one of the\r\nmiraculous deeds which so largely make up the widespread legend of the\r\nsaint[214]. Nicholas restores to life the three clerks\r\n\r\n      ‘quos causa discendi literas\r\n  apud gentes transmisit exteras,’\r\n\r\nand whom the greed of an innkeeper has slain[215]. He provides with a\r\ndowry the daughters of a poor gentleman, who are threatened with a life\r\nof shame[216]. He brings back from captivity the son of his wealthy\r\nadorer[217]. His image preserves from housebreakers the riches of a\r\nJew[218]. Alone of the extant Latin plays, these of St. Nicholas are\r\ndrawn from outside the Biblical story. Each of the Fleury versions\r\nintroduces at the end one of the anthems proper to St. Nicholas’ day, and\r\ntheir connexion with the feast is therefore clear.\r\n\r\nA second Lazarus play, which includes not only the _Suscitatio_ but also\r\nthe episode of Mary Magdalen in the house of Simon, is likewise in the\r\nFleury play-book[219]. A second _Daniel_, composed by the _iuventus_ of\r\nBeauvais, occurs in the same manuscript which contains the Office of\r\nthe Circumcision for that cathedral[220]. It was perhaps intended for\r\nperformance on the day of the _asinaria festa_. Other plays seem, in\r\nthe same way as the _Daniel_, to have budded off from the _Prophetae_.\r\nA fragment is preserved of an _Isaac and Rebecca_ from Kloster Vorau\r\nin Styria[221]. A twelfth-century mention of an _Elisaeus_[222] and\r\nan eleventh-century one of a _Convivium Herodis_[223], which suggests\r\nrather the story of John the Baptist than that of the _Magi_, point to an\r\nactivity in this direction of which all the traces have possibly not yet\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\nThree plays, each more or less unique in character, complete the tale.\r\nThe Fleury play-book has a _Conversio Beati Pauli Apostoli_, doubtless\r\ndesigned for the feast on January 25[224]. The shorter, but highly\r\ninteresting collection from Limoges, has a play of the wise and foolish\r\nvirgins, under the title of _Sponsus_[225]. This has attracted much\r\nattention from scholars, on account of the fact that it is partly in\r\nFrench, or more strictly in a dialect belonging to the Angoumois, and\r\nslightly affected by Provençal. As it is therefore of the nature of a\r\ntransitional form, it may be well to give a somewhat full account of it.\r\nIt opens with a Latin chorus beginning\r\n\r\n  ‘Adest sponsus qui est Christus: vigilate, virgines!’\r\n\r\nThe angel Gabriel then addresses the virgins, and warns them in four\r\nFrench stanzas to expect ‘un espos, Sauvaire a nom.’ Each stanza has a\r\nrefrain, probably sung chorally:\r\n\r\n          ‘gaire noi dormet:\r\n  aici’s l’espos que vos or atendet!\r\n\r\nThen comes a lyric dialogue, in which the _Fatuae_, who have wasted their\r\noil, attempt in vain to get some, first from the _Prudentes_, and then\r\nfrom some _Mercatores_, whose presence here recalls the _unguentarius_\r\nin the Prague versions of the _Quem quaeritis_[226]. This dialogue is in\r\nLatin, but with a French refrain:\r\n\r\n  ‘dolentas, chaitivas, trop i avem (_or_ avet) dormit.’\r\n\r\nThen comes the _Sponsus_, to whom the _Fatuae_ finally appeal:\r\n\r\n            ‘audi, sponse, voces plangentium:\r\n            aperire fac nobis ostium\r\n            cum sociis ad dulce prandium;\r\n            nostrae culpae praebe remedium!\r\n      dolentas, chaitivas, trop i avem dormit.\r\n                      _Christus._\r\n        amen dico, vos ignosco, nam caretis lumine,\r\n        quod qui perdunt procul pergunt huius aulae limine.\r\n            alet, chaitivas, alet, malaüreias!\r\n            a tot jors mais vos son penas livreias,\r\n            e en efern ora seret meneias!\r\n    _Modo accipiant eas daemones et praecipitentur in infernum._’\r\n\r\nThis stage direction, together with an allusion in the opening lines of\r\nthe _Sponsus_ to the ‘second Adam,’ link this remarkable, and, I venture\r\nto think, finely conceived little piece to the Christmas play of _Adam_\r\nto be discussed in the next chapter. It has essentially an Advent theme,\r\nand must have been performed either in Advent itself or at the Christmas\r\nseason, with which Advent is prophetically connected[227].\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a play which was almost certainly performed at\r\nAdvent[228]. This is the Tegernsee play of _Antichristus_[229]. It\r\nis founded upon the prophecy in St. Paul’s second epistle to the\r\nThessalonians of the _homo peccati, filius perditionis_, who shall sit\r\nin the temple of God until the Christ shall slay him with the breath\r\nof his mouth, and destroy him with the glory of his advent[230]: and\r\nit is an elaborate spectacle, requiring for its proper performance\r\na large number of actors and a spacious stage, with a temple of God\r\nand seven royal _sedes_, together with room for much marching and\r\ncounter-marching and warfare[231]. It must have taken up the whole nave\r\nof some great church. It begins with a procession of Emperor, Pope, and\r\nKings, accompanied by personages emblematic of _Gentilitas_, _Sinagoga_\r\nand _Ecclesia_ with her attendants _Misericordia_ and _Iustitia_. The\r\nfirst part of the action represents the conquest of the four corners of\r\nChristendom by the Emperor and his championship of Jerusalem against the\r\nKing of Babylon. _Ecclesia_, _Gentilitas_, and _Synagoga_ punctuate the\r\nperformance with their characteristic chants. Then come the Hypocrites,\r\n_sub silentio et specie humilitatis inclinantes circumquaque et captantes\r\nfavorem laicorum_. They are followed by Antichrist himself, who instructs\r\nHypocrisy and Heresy to prepare the way for his advent. Presently\r\nAntichrist is enthroned in the temple and gradually saps the Empire,\r\nwinning over the King of the Greeks by threats, the King of the Franks by\r\ngifts, and the King of the Teutons, who is incorruptible and invincible,\r\nby signs and wonders. He marks his vassals on the brow with the first\r\nletter of his name. Then the Hypocrites attempt to persuade _Synagoga_\r\nthat Antichrist is the Messiah; but are refuted by the prophets Enoch\r\nand Elijah. Antichrist has the rebels slain; but while he is throned in\r\nstate, thunder breaks suddenly over his head, he falls, and _Ecclesia_\r\ncomes to her own again with a _Laudem dicite deo nostro_.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Antichristus_ is not only a skilled craftsman in\r\nrhyming Latin metres; he is also capable of carrying a big literary\r\nscheme successfully to a close. His immediate source was probably\r\nthe tenth-century _Libellus de Antichristo_ of Adso of Toul[232].\r\nInto this he has worked the central theme of the _Prophetae_ and the\r\ndebating figures from that very popular _débat_ or ‘estrif,’ the\r\n_Altercatio Ecclesiae et Synagogae_[233]. His work differs in several\r\nobvious respects from the comparatively simple, often naïve, liturgical\r\ndramas which have been considered. It is ambitious in scope, extending\r\nto between four and five hundred lines. It introduces allegorical\r\nfigures, such as we shall find, long after, in the moralities. It has\r\na purpose other than that of devotion, or even amusement. It is, in\r\nfact, a _Tendenzschrift_, a pamphlet. The instinct of the drama, which\r\nsways the imaginations of men perhaps more powerfully than any other\r\nform of literature, to mix itself up with politics is incorrigible:\r\n_Antichristus_ is a subtle vindication, on the one hand, of the Empire\r\nagainst the Papacy, on the other of the _rex Teutonicorum_ against the\r\n_rex Francorum_. It probably dates from about 1160, when Frederick\r\nBarbarossa was at the height of his struggle with Alexander III, who\r\nenjoyed the sympathies of Louis VII of France. And it is anti-clerical.\r\nThe Hypocrites who carry out the machinations of Antichrist are the\r\nclerical reformers, such as Gerhoh of Reichersberg[234], who were the\r\nmainstay of the papacy in Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is improbable that the few and scattered texts which have come to\r\nlight represent all the liturgical plays which had made their appearance\r\nby the middle of the twelfth century. Besides the lost _Elisaeus_ and\r\n_Convivium Herodis_, there is evidence, for example, of scholars’ plays\r\nin honour, not only of St. Nicholas, but of their second patron, the\r\nphilosophical St. Catharine of Alexandria. Such a _ludus de Sancta\r\nKatarina_ was prepared at Dunstable in England by one Geoffrey, a Norman\r\nclerk who had been invited to England as schoolmaster to the abbey of St.\r\nAlbans. For it he borrowed certain choir copes belonging to the abbey,\r\nand had the misfortune to let these be burnt with his house. Deeply\r\nrepentant, he took the religious habit, and in 1119 became abbot of St.\r\nAlbans. From this date that of the _ludus_ may be judged to be early in\r\nthe twelfth century[235].\r\n\r\nIt cannot, of course, be assumed that every play, say in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, which although probably or certainly written in the vernacular\r\nwas performed in a church, had a Latin prototype[236]. Many such may\r\nhave been written and acted for the first time on existing models, when\r\nthe vernacular drama was already well established. But there are certain\r\nfeasts where it is possible to trace, on the one hand, the element of\r\nmimetic ceremony in the services, and on the other, perhaps, some later\r\nrepresentation in the dramatic cycles, and where a Latin text might at\r\nany time turn up without causing surprise. With a few notes on some of\r\nthese this chapter must conclude. A highly dramatic trope for Ascension\r\nday, closely resembling the _Quem quaeritis_, has already been quoted\r\nfrom the tropers of Limoges[237]. An _Ordinarium_ of St. Peter’s of Lille\r\ndirects that, after the respond _Non vos relinquam_, the officiant shall\r\nmount a pulpit and thence appear to ascend towards heaven from the top of\r\na mountain[238]. Fifteenth-century _computi_ speak of this or of a more\r\nelaborate performance as a _mysterium_, and include amongst other items\r\npayments for painting the scars on the hands of the performer[239]. On\r\nWhit-Sunday it was the custom at St. Paul’s in London and many other\r\nchurches, during the singing of the hymn _Veni Creator Spiritus_ at\r\nTierce, to open a hole in the roof and let down symbols of the Pentecost;\r\na dove, a globe of fire, bits of burning tow to represent tongues of\r\nfire, a censer, flowers, pieces of flaky pastry[240]. This same hole in\r\nthe roof sometimes served a similar purpose at a mimetic representation\r\nof the Annunciation. The Gospel for the day was recited by two clerks\r\ndressed as Mary and the angel, and at the words _Spiritus Sanctus\r\nsupervenit in te_ a white dove descended from the roof. This can hardly\r\nbe called a drama, for, with the exception of a short fifteenth-century\r\ntext from Cividale, only the words of the Gospel itself seem to have\r\nbeen used; but obviously it is on the extreme verge of drama. A curious\r\nvariant in the date of this ceremony is to be noted. In several Italian\r\nexamples, of which the earliest dates from 1261, and in one or two\r\nfrom France, it belongs to the feast of the Annunciation proper on\r\nMarch 25[241]. But in later French examples, and apparently also at\r\nLincoln[242], it has been transferred to the Advent season, during which\r\nnaturally the Annunciation was greatly held in remembrance, and has\r\nbeen attached to the so-called ‘golden’ Mass celebrated ten days before\r\nChristmas during the _Quatuor Tempora_[243]. It thus became absorbed into\r\nthe Christmas dramatic cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE SECULARIZATION OF THE PLAYS\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._—The best general account of the\r\n    vernacular religious drama of Europe is that of W. Creizenach,\r\n    _Geschichte des neueren Dramas_ (vol. i. 1893), Books 2-4;\r\n    and this may be supplemented by K. Hase, _Das geistliche\r\n    Schauspiel_ (1858, trans. A. W. Jackson, 1880); R. Proelss,\r\n    _Geschichte des neueren Dramas_ (1880-3), vol. i. ch. 1; C.\r\n    Davidson, _English Mystery Plays_ (1892), and G. Gregory\r\n    Smith, _The Transition Period_ (1900), ch. 7. There is also\r\n    the cumbrous work of J. L. Klein, _Geschichte des Dramas_\r\n    (1865-86). The nearest approach to a general bibliography is\r\n    F. H. Stoddard, _References for Students of Miracle Plays\r\n    and Mysteries_ (1887).—For Germany may be added R. Froning,\r\n    _Das Drama des Mittelalters_ (1890-1); K. Pearson, _The\r\n    German Passion Play_ (in _The Chances of Death and Other\r\n    Studies in Evolution_, 1897, vol. ii); L. Wirth, _Die Oster-\r\n    und Passionsspiele bis zum 16. Jahrhundert_ (1889); J. E.\r\n    Wackernell, _Altdeutsche Passionsspiele aus Tirol_, 1897;\r\n    R. Heinzel, _Beschreibung des geistlichen Schauspiels im\r\n    deutschen Mittelalter_ (1898), and the articles by F. Vogt on\r\n    _Mittelhochdeutsche Literatur_, § 73, and H. Jellinghaus on\r\n    _Mittelniederdeutsche Literatur_, § 5, in H. Paul, _Grundriss\r\n    der germanischen Philologie_, vol. ii (2nd ed. 1901). F. Vogt\r\n    gives a few additional recent references. Older works are F.\r\n    J. Mone, _Schauspiele des Mittelalters_ (1846); H. Reidt,\r\n    _Das geistliche Schauspiel des Mittelalters in Deutschland_\r\n    (1868), and E. Wilken, _Geschichte der geistlichen Spiele in\r\n    Deutschland_ (1872). Many of the books named print texts.\r\n    Lists of others are given by Pearson and by Heinzel, and\r\n    full bibliographical notices by K. Goedeke, _Grundriss zur\r\n    Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung_ (2nd ed.), vol. i (1884),\r\n    §§ 67, 92, and vol. ii (1886), § 145.—For France, L. Petit de\r\n    Julleville, _Les Mystères_ (1880), is excellent and exhaustive,\r\n    and contains many bibliographical references, although the\r\n    ‘Liste des ouvrages à consulter’ intended as part of the work\r\n    seems never to have been printed. M. de Julleville is also the\r\n    writer of the article on _Théâtre religieux_ in the _Hist. de\r\n    la Langue et de la Littérature françaises_, vol. ii (1896). G.\r\n    Gröber’s article on _Französische Litteratur_, §§ 129, 362 in\r\n    his _Grundriss der romanischen Philologie_, vol. ii (1901-2),\r\n    brings the subject up to date and adds some recent authorities.\r\n    Mortensen, _Medeltidsdramat i Frankrike_ (1899), is beyond my\r\n    range. G. Paris, _La Littérature française au moyen âge_ (2nd\r\n    ed., 1890), is a brief summary, and L. Clédat, _Le Théâtre\r\n    au moyen âge_ (1897), a useful popular account. G. Bapst,\r\n    _Essai sur l’Histoire du Théâtre_ (1893), is good on matters\r\n    of stage arrangement. Older works are O. Le Roy, _Études sur\r\n    les Mystères_ (1837), and J. de Douhet, _Dictionnaire des\r\n    Mystères_ (1854). Only fragments of C. Magnin’s investigations\r\n    are available in the _Journal des Savants_ (1846-7) and the\r\n    _Journal général de l’Instruction publique_ (1834-6). Texts are\r\n    in A. Jubinal, _Mystères du 15ᵉ siècle_ (1837); Monmerqué et\r\n    Michel, _Théâtre français au moyen âge_ (1842); E. Fournier,\r\n    _Le Théâtre français avant la Renaissance_ (1872), and the\r\n    series published by the _Société des Anciens Textes français_.\r\n    The most recent text of _Adam_ is that by K. Grass, _Das\r\n    Adamsspiel_ (1891). M. Wilmotte, _Les Passions allemandes du\r\n    Rhin dans leur Rapport avec l’ancien Théâtre français_ (1898),\r\n    deals with the interrelations of the French and German texts.\r\n    C. Hastings, _Le Théâtre français et anglais_ (1900, trans.\r\n    1901), is a compilation of little merit.—For Italy there is A.\r\n    D’Ancona, _Origini del Teatro italiano_ (2nd ed. 1891), with\r\n    texts in the same writer’s _Sacre Rappresentazioni_ (1872), in\r\n    Monaci, _Appunti per la Storia del Teatro italiano_ (_Rivista\r\n    di Filologia Romana_, vols. i, ii), and in F. Torraca, _Il\r\n    Teatro italiano dei Secoli xiii, xiv, e xv_ (1885).—For Spain,\r\n    A. F. von Schack, _Geschichte der dramatischen Litteratur\r\n    und Kunst in Spanien_ (1845-54), and G. Baist, _Spanische\r\n    Litteratur_, §§ 19, 63, in Gröber’s _Grundriss_, vol. ii\r\n    (1897).—For the minor Romance dramatic literatures, Provençal,\r\n    Catalan, Portuguese, I must be content to refer to the\r\n    last-named authority, and for that of Holland to the similar\r\n    _Grundriss_ of H. Paul.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the liturgic play described in the last two chapters may\r\nbe fairly held to have been complete about the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The condition of any further advance was that the play should\r\ncease to be liturgic. The following hundred years are a transition\r\nperiod. During their course the newly-shaped drama underwent a process\r\nwhich, within the limits imposed by the fact that its subject-matter\r\nremained essentially religious, may be called secularization. Already,\r\nwhen Hilarius could write plays to serve indifferently for use at Matins\r\nor at Vespers, the primitive relation of _repraesentatio_ to liturgy had\r\nbeen sensibly weakened. By the middle of the fourteenth century it was\r\na mere survival. From ecclesiastical the drama had become popular. Out\r\nof the hands of the clergy in their naves and choirs, it had passed to\r\nthose of the laity in their market-places and guild-halls. And to this\r\nformal change corresponded a spiritual or literary one, in the reaction\r\nof the temper of the folk upon the handling of the plays, the broadening\r\nof their human as distinct from their religious aspect. In their origin\r\n_officia_ for devotion and edification, they came, by an irony familiar\r\nto the psychologist, to be primarily _spectacula_ for mirth, wonder, and\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the formal change with which I am here mainly concerned;\r\nand of this it will be the object of the present chapter to trace as\r\nbriefly as possible the outlines. The principal factor is certainly\r\nthat tendency to expansion and coalescence in the plays which has been\r\nalready seen at work in the production of such elaborate pieces as the\r\n_Quem quaeritis_ of the Tours or that of the Benedictbeuern manuscript,\r\nthe Fleury _Stella_, the Rouen _Prophetae_ and the _Antichristus_. This\r\nculminates in the formation of those great dramatic cycles of which the\r\nEnglish Corpus Christi plays are perhaps the most complete examples.\r\nBut before we can approach these, we must consider a little further the\r\nindependent development of the Easter and Christmas groups.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that, during the period now under discussion, the\r\nimportance of Christmas falls markedly into the background when compared\r\nwith that of Easter; and a reason for this will presently suggest\r\nitself. The _Stella_, indeed, as such, appears to have almost reached\r\nits term[244]; for such further growth as there is we must look chiefly\r\nto the _Prophetae_. The process by which little episodic dramas, as\r\nof Balaam and Nebuchadnezzar at Rouen, bud out from the stem of the\r\n_Prophetae_, is one capable of infinite extension. By 1204 the play had\r\nfound its way to Riga, on the extreme border of European civilization,\r\nand the _ludus prophetarum ordinatissimus_ there performed included\r\nscenes from the wars of Gideon, David, and Herod[245]. The text of the\r\nRiga play is unfortunately not preserved, but the famous Norman-French\r\n_Ordo repraesentationis Adae_ is an example of a _Prophetae_, in which\r\nthe episodes, no longer confined to the stories of the prophets in the\r\nstricter sense, have outgrown and cast into the shade the original\r\nintention[246]. Most things about the _Adam_ are in dispute. Scholars\r\ndiffer as to whether the manuscript belongs to the twelfth or the\r\nthirteenth century, and as to whether it is the work of a Norman or\r\nof an Anglo-Norman scribe. The piece is manifestly incomplete, but\r\nhow far incomplete it is hard to say. What we have consists of three\r\nsections. There is a long play of nearly six hundred lines on the Fall\r\nand Expulsion from Paradise, in which the speakers are Adam and Eve, the\r\n_Figura_ of God and the _Diabolus_. Then comes a much shorter one of Cain\r\nand Abel; and finally a _Prophetae_, which breaks off after the part\r\nof Nebuchadnezzar. Of the general character of this interesting piece\r\nsomething further will be said presently, but the point to notice here is\r\nthat, although Adam and Abel may of course be regarded as prophetic types\r\nof Christ, if not exactly prophets, yet there is a real extension of the\r\ndramatic content of the _Prophetae_ in the prefixing to it of a treatment\r\nof so momentous a subject as the Fall[247]. For with the addition of the\r\nFall to the already dramatized Redemption, the framework of a structural\r\nunity was at once provided for the great cosmic drama of the future. And\r\nthe important motive seems to have been still further emphasized in a\r\nlost play performed at Regensburg in 1195, which treated, besides the\r\nProphets and the Creation and Fall of Man, the Creation of the Angels and\r\nthe Fall of Lucifer[248].\r\n\r\nYet another step towards the completion of the Christmas cycle was\r\ntaken when the _Prophetae_ and the _Stella_ were brought together in a\r\nsingle drama. Such a merging is represented by two related texts from\r\nGerman sources[249]. One is from a fourteenth-century manuscript now\r\nat St. Gall[250]. The structure is of the simplest. The setting of the\r\npseudo-Augustine sermon has altogether disappeared. Eight prophets\r\ndeliver a speech apiece, announcing their own identities after a naïve\r\nfashion—_Ich bin der alte Balaam_, and so forth—which strongly recalls\r\nthe ‘folk’ or ‘mummers’’ plays. Then follows without break a _Stella_,\r\nwhose scenes range from the Marriage of the Virgin to the Death of Herod.\r\nFar more elaborate is the Christmas play found in the famous repertory\r\nof the _scholares vagantes_ from Benedictbeuern[251]. A peculiarity of\r\nthis is that for the first time Augustine appears _in propria persona_.\r\nHe presides over the prophecies, taking the place of the _Precentor_ of\r\nthe Limoges _Prophetae_, and the _Appellatores_ or _Vocatores_ of Laon\r\nand Rouen. The only prophets are Isaiah, Daniel, the Sibyl, Aaron, and\r\nBalaam, and there is once more a special episode for Balaam’s ass.\r\n\r\n    ‘_Quinto loco procedat Balaam sedens in asina et cantans_:\r\n\r\n      vadam, vadam, ut maledicam populo huic.\r\n\r\n    _Cui occurrat Angelus evaginato gladio dicens_:\r\n\r\n      cave, cave ne quicquam aliud quam tibi dixero loquaris.\r\n\r\n    _Et asinus cui insidet Balaam perterritus retrocedat. Postea\r\n    recedat angelus et Balaam cantet hoc_:\r\n\r\n      orietur stella ex Iacob, etc.’\r\n\r\nA long _disputatio_ follows between Augustine, an _Archisynagogus_, and\r\nthe prophets, in which at one point no less a person intervenes than\r\nthe _Episcopus Puerorum_, affording an interesting example of that\r\ninterrelation between the religious plays and the festivities of the\r\n_triduum_ and the Feast of Fools, about which something has already\r\nbeen said[252]. Presently the prophets retire and sit _in locis suis\r\npropter honorem ludi_. The _Stella_ extends from the Annunciation to\r\nthe Flight into Egypt. Here the original play seems to have ended; but\r\na later writer has added a scene in Egypt, in which the idols fall at\r\nthe approach of the Holy Family, and some fragments adapted from the\r\n_Antichristus_, and hardly worked up into anything that can be called a\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nThe form of Christmas play, then, characteristic of the transition\r\ncentury, consists of a version of the _Prophetae_ extended at the\r\nbeginning by a dramatic treatment of the Fall, or extended at the end\r\nby the absorption of the _Stella_. It so happens that we do not, during\r\nthe period in question, find examples in which both extensions occur\r\ntogether. But this double amplification would only be the slightest step\r\nin advance, and may perhaps be taken for granted. The Rouen _Mystère\r\nde l’Incarnation et la Nativité_ of 1474 offers, at a much later date,\r\nprecisely the missing type[253].\r\n\r\nThe Easter cycle, also, received memorable accretions during the period.\r\nThe _Quem quaeritis_ of the Tours manuscript, it will be remembered,\r\nincluded a series of scenes beginning with the Setting of the Watch\r\nbefore the Sepulchre, and ending with the Incredulity of Thomas.\r\nImportant additions had still to be made, even within the limits of\r\nthis _cadre_. One was a more complete treatment of the Resurrection\r\nitself through the introduction of the figure of Christ stepping with\r\nthe _labarum_ out of the sepulchre, in place of a mere symbolical\r\nindication of the mystery by the presence of angels with lighted candles\r\nand the dismay of the soldiers[254]. Another, closely related to the\r\nResurrection, was the scene known as the Harrowing of Hell. This was\r\nbased upon the account of the _Descensus Christi ad Inferos_, the\r\nvictory over Satan, and the freeing from limbo of Adam and the other\r\nOld Testament Fathers, which forms part of the apocryphal _Gospel of\r\nNichodemus_[255]. The narrative makes use of that _Tollite portas_\r\npassage from the twenty-fourth Psalm, which we have already found\r\nadapted to the use of more than one semi-dramatic ceremonial[256], and\r\nnaturally this found its way into the Harrowing of Hell, together with\r\nthe so-called _canticum triumphale_, a song of welcome by the imprisoned\r\nsouls:\r\n\r\n  ‘Advenisti, desirabilis, quem exspectabamus in tenebris, ut educeres\r\n  hac nocte vinculatos de claustris.\r\n\r\n  te nostra vocabant suspiria.\r\n\r\n  te larga requirebant lamenta.\r\n\r\n  tu factus es spes desperatis, magna consolatio in tormentis.’\r\n\r\nI cannot share the view of those who look upon the East Midland English\r\n_Harrowing of Hell_ as intended for dramatic representation. The\r\nprologues found in two of the three manuscripts leave it clear that\r\nit was for recitation. It is in fact of the nature of an ‘estrif’ or\r\n_débat_, and may be compared with an Anglo-Saxon poem of the eighth or\r\ntenth century on the same subject[257]. But there is evidence that the\r\nscene had found its way into the Easter cycle at least by the beginning\r\nof the thirteenth century, for it occurs amongst the fragments of a\r\nplay of that date from Kloster Muri; and in later versions it assumed a\r\nconsiderable prominence[258].\r\n\r\nThe liturgical drama proper abstained in the main from any strictly\r\ndramatic representation of the Passion. The nearest approach to such a\r\nthing is in the dialogued versions of the _Planctus Mariae_ and in the\r\nBenedictbeuern _Ludus breviter de Passione_, which extends very slightly\r\nbeyond these. The central event of the transition period is, therefore,\r\nthe growth side by side with the _Quem quaeritis_ of a Passion play,\r\nwhich in the end rather absorbs than is absorbed by it. A marked advance\r\nin this direction is shown in an Anglo-Norman fragment, probably written\r\nin the twelfth century, which includes, not indeed the Crucifixion\r\nitself, but the Descent from the Cross, the Healing of Longinus, and the\r\nBurial of Christ[259]. The first recorded Passion play is in Italy. It\r\ntook place at Siena about 1200[260]. In 1244 the Passion and Resurrection\r\nwere played together at Padua[261]. The earliest text of a Passion play\r\nis contained in the Benedictbeuern manuscript[262]. It opens with the\r\nCalling of Andrew and Peter, the Healing of the Blind, Zacchaeus and the\r\nEntry into Jerusalem. Then follows a long episode of Mary Magdalen. She\r\nis represented with her lover, buying cosmetics of a _Mercator_—we have\r\nhad the _Mercator_ in the _Quem quaeritis_ and in the _Sponsus_—and with\r\na profane song upon her lips:\r\n\r\n  ‘Mundi delectatio dulcis est et grata,\r\n  cuius conversatio suavis et ornata.’\r\n\r\nShe is converted in a dream, puts on black, buys ointments from the same\r\n_Mercator_, and adores the Lord in the house of Simon. Then come, far\r\nmore briefly treated, the Raising of Lazarus, the Betrayal by Judas, the\r\nLast Supper, the Mount of Olives, the Passion itself, from the Taking in\r\nGethsemane to the Crucifixion. The introduction here of some _planctus\r\nMariae_ points to the _genesis_ of the drama, which closes with the\r\nBegging of the Body of Christ by Joseph of Arimathaea. And so, at a blow,\r\nas it were, the content of the Easter play is doubled. Certain episodes,\r\nsuch as the Conversion of Mary Magdalen and the Raising of Lazarus had,\r\nas we know, received an independent dramatic treatment; but in the main\r\nthe play before us, or its source, bears the character of a deliberate\r\ncomposition on the lines of the pre-existing _Quem quaeritis_. That it\r\nwas to be followed in representation by a _Quem quaeritis_ may perhaps\r\nbe taken for granted. Indeed there is one personage, the wife of the\r\n_Mercator_, who is named in a list at the beginning, but has no part in\r\nthe text as it stands[263]. She may have come into the Benedictbeuern\r\n_Quem quaeritis_, of which a fragment only survives, and this may have\r\nbeen intended for use, as might be convenient, either with the _Ludus\r\nbreviter de Passione_, or with the longer text now under consideration.\r\nAt all events, Passion and Resurrection are treated together in two\r\nslightly later texts, one from the south of France[264], the other from\r\nSt. Gall[265]. The St. Gall Passion play takes the action back to the\r\nbeginning of the missionary life of Christ, giving the Marriage at Cana,\r\nthe Baptism, and the Temptation. It also includes a Harrowing of Hell.\r\n\r\nCertain forms of the Passion play, as the conjoint Passion and\r\nResurrection may now be termed, show an approximation to the type of the\r\nChristmas play. It is obvious that the Fall and the _Prophetae_ would\r\nbe as proper a prologue to the Passion which completes the Atonement\r\nas to the Nativity which begins it. And the presence of Adam and other\r\nOld Testament characters in the Harrowing of Hell would be the more\r\nsignificant if in some earlier scene they had visibly been haled there.\r\nThe first trace of these new elements is in the St. Gall play, where the\r\nAugustine of the _Prophetae_ is introduced to speak a prologue. A long\r\nFrankfort play of the fourteenth century, of which unfortunately only\r\nthe stage directions and actors’ cues are preserved, carries the process\r\nfurther[266]. Again Augustine acts as presenter. A _Prophetae_ begins the\r\nperformance, which ends with the Ascension, a _Disputatio Ecclesiae et\r\nSynagogae_ and the baptizing of the incredulous Jews by Augustine. On the\r\nother hand, the Fall forms the first part of an early fourteenth-century\r\nPassion play from Vienna[267]. Both the Fall of Lucifer and that of\r\nAdam and Eve are included, and there is a supplementary scene in hell,\r\ninto which the souls of a usurer, a monk, a robber, and a sorceress are\r\nsuccessively brought. Lucifer refuses to have anything to do with the\r\nmonk, an early use of the Tomlinson motive.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic evolution is now within measurable distance of the ‘cosmic’\r\ntype finally presented by the English Corpus Christi plays. Two further\r\nsteps are necessary: the juxtaposition of the Nativity and Passion scenes\r\nbehind their common Old Testament prologue, and the final winding up\r\nof the action by the extension of it from the Ascension to the second\r\ncoming of the Christ in the Last Judgement. The eschatological scenes\r\nof the _Sponsus_ and the _Antichristus_ are already available for such\r\nan epilogue. That the whole of this vast framework was put together by\r\nthe beginning of the fourteenth century may be inferred from the notices\r\nof two performances, in 1298 and 1303 respectively, at Cividale[268].\r\nThe first included the Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, Advent of\r\nthe Holy Spirit, and Advent of Christ to Judgement: the second added\r\nto these the Creation, Annunciation, Nativity, with much else, and the\r\nAntichrist. Any further development could now be merely episodic. The\r\ntext could be amplified at the fancy of the individual writer, or upon\r\nthe suggestion of the great epic narratives, such as the _Cursor Mundi_,\r\nthe _Passional_, the _Erlösung_[269]. An infinity of new scenes could be\r\nadded from the Old Testament[270], from the apocryphal gospels and acts,\r\nfrom the historic narratives of the vengeance of the Crucified One upon\r\nRome and Jewry[271]. But beyond the limits of the fixed _cadre_ it was\r\nnow impossible to go, for these were coincident with the span of time and\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to consider briefly some modifications in the general\r\ncharacter of the religious plays which accompanied or resulted from this\r\ngreat expansion of their scope. These all tend towards that process of\r\nsecularization, that relaxing of the close bonds between the nascent\r\ndrama and religious worship, which it is the especial object of this\r\nchapter to illustrate. Of capital importance is the transference of the\r\nplays from the interior of the church to its precincts, to the graveyard\r\nor the neighbouring market-place. This must have been primarily a matter\r\nof physical necessity. The growing length of the plays, the increasing\r\nelaboration of their setting, made it cumbrous and difficult to\r\naccommodate them within the walls. It is a big step from the early _Quem\r\nquaeritis, Pastores_ or _Stella_, with their simple _mises-en-scène_ of\r\n_sepulchrum_ and _praesepe_ to the complicated requirements, say, of the\r\nFleury group, the _tabernaculum in similitudinem castelli Emaus_ for the\r\n_Peregrini_, the half-dozen _loca_, _domus_, or _sedes_ demanded by the\r\n_Suscitatio Lazari_ or the _Conversio Pauli_. Still more exigent is the\r\n_Antichristus_ with its _templum domini_ and its seven _sedes regales_,\r\nand its space in between for marchings and counter-marchings and the\r\noverthrowing of kings. Yet for a long time the church proved sufficient.\r\nThe Tours _Quem quaeritis_ and some, if not all, of the Fleury plays\r\nwere demonstrably played in the church. So was the Rouen _Prophetae_,\r\nand an allusion of Gerhoh of Reichersberg makes it extremely probable\r\nthat so was the _Antichristus_[272]. One must conceive, I think, of the\r\nperformances as gradually spreading from choir to nave, with the _domus_,\r\n_loca_, or _sedes_ set at intervals against the pillars, while the people\r\ncrowded to watch in the side aisles. It is in the twelfth century that\r\nthe plays first seek ampler room outside the church. Of the transition\r\nplays dealt with in the present chapter, the _Adam_, the Benedictbeuern\r\nChristmas play, the Anglo-Norman _Resurrection_, were certainly intended\r\nfor the open, and the contrary cannot be affirmed in any case with the\r\nsame assurance. Again, the Riga _Prophetae_ of 1204 was _in media Riga_,\r\nthe Padua Passion play of 1244 was in a meadow, the _Pratum Vallis_,\r\nwhile in England an early thirteenth-century biographer of St. John\r\nof Beverley records a miracle wrought at a Resurrection play in the\r\nchurchyard of the minster.\r\n\r\nOf the type of performance now rendered possible, a very good notion is\r\ngiven by the full stage directions of the _Adam_. These are so valuable\r\na document for the history of stage management that I must take leave to\r\nexcerpt from them somewhat liberally. The opening rubric recalls at once\r\nthe minute stage directions of Ibsen and the counsel to the players in\r\n_Hamlet_.\r\n\r\n    ‘A Paradise is to be made in a raised spot, with curtains and\r\n    cloths of silk hung round it at such a height that persons\r\n    in the Paradise may be visible from the shoulders upwards.\r\n    Fragrant flowers and leaves are to be set round about, and\r\n    divers trees put therein with hanging fruit, so as to give the\r\n    likeness of a most delicate spot. Then must come the Saviour\r\n    clothed in a dalmatic, and Adam and Eve be brought before him.\r\n    Adam is to wear a red tunic and Eve a woman’s robe of white,\r\n    with a white silk cloak; and they are both to stand before\r\n    the Figure, Adam the nearer with composed countenance, while\r\n    Eve appears somewhat more modest. And the Adam must be well\r\n    trained when to reply and to be neither too quick nor too\r\n    slow in his replies. And not only he, but all the personages\r\n    must be trained to speak composedly, and to fit convenient\r\n    gesture to the matter of their speech. Nor must they foist in a\r\n    syllable or clip one of the verse, but must enounce firmly and\r\n    repeat what is set down for them in due order. Whosoever names\r\n    Paradise is to look and point towards it.’\r\n\r\nAfter a _lectio_ and a chant by the choir, the dialogue begins. The\r\n_Figura_ instructs Adam and Eve as to their duties and inducts them into\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\n    ‘Then the Figure must depart to the church and Adam and Eve\r\n    walk about Paradise in honest delight. Meanwhile the demons are\r\n    to run about the stage (_per plateas_), with suitable gestures,\r\n    approaching the Paradise from time to time and pointing out the\r\n    forbidden fruit to Eve, as though persuading her to eat it.\r\n    Then the Devil is to come and address Adam.’\r\n\r\nThe _diabolus_ thinks he is prevailing upon Adam. He joins the other\r\ndemons and make sallies about the _plateae_. Then he returns _hylaris et\r\ngaudens_ to the charge. But he fails.\r\n\r\n    ‘Then, sadly and with downcast countenance, he shall leave\r\n    Adam, and go to the doors of hell, and hold council with the\r\n    other demons. Thereafter he shall make a sally amongst the\r\n    people, and then approach Paradise on Eve’s side, addressing\r\n    her with joyful countenance and insinuating (_blandiens_)\r\n    manner.’\r\n\r\nEve, too, is hard to persuade, and is scolded by Adam for listening to\r\nthe _diabolus_. But when a _serpens artificiose compositus_ rises hard by\r\nthe trunk of the forbidden tree, she lends her ear, is won over, takes\r\nthe apple and gives it to Adam.\r\n\r\n    ‘Then Adam is to eat part of the apple; and after eating it he\r\n    shall immediately recognize his sin and debase himself. He must\r\n    now be out of sight of the people, and shall put off his solemn\r\n    raiment, and put on poor raiment sewn together of fig-leaves,\r\n    and with an air of extreme dolour shall begin his lament.’\r\n\r\nWhen the Figure ‘wearing a stole’ comes again, Adam and Eve hide in a\r\ncorner of Paradise, and when called upon stand up, ‘not altogether erect,\r\nbut for shame of their sin somewhat bowed and very sad.’ They are driven\r\nout, and an angel with a radiant sword is put at the gate of Paradise.\r\nThe Figure returns to the church.\r\n\r\n    ‘Then Adam shall have a spade and Eve a hoe, and they shall\r\n    begin to till the soil and sow corn therein. And when they\r\n    have sown, they shall go and sit down a while, as if wearied\r\n    with toil, and anon look tearfully at Paradise, beating their\r\n    breasts. Meanwhile shall come the devil and shall plant thorns\r\n    and thistles in their tillage, and avoid. And when Adam and Eve\r\n    come to their tillage and see the thorns and thistles sprung\r\n    up, they shall be smitten with violent grief and shall throw\r\n    themselves on the earth and sit there, beating their breasts\r\n    and thighs and betraying grief by their gestures. And Adam\r\n    shall begin a lament.’\r\n\r\nNow the last scene is at hand.\r\n\r\n    ‘Then shall come the devil and three or four devils with\r\n    him, carrying in their hands chains and iron fetters, which\r\n    they shall put on the necks of Adam and Eve. And some shall\r\n    push and others pull them to hell; and hard by hell shall be\r\n    other devils ready to meet them, who shall hold high revel\r\n    (_tripudium_) at their fall. And certain other devils shall\r\n    point them out as they come, and shall snatch them up and\r\n    carry them into hell; and there shall they make a great smoke\r\n    arise, and call aloud to each other with glee in their hell,\r\n    and clash their pots and kettles, that they may be heard\r\n    without. And after a little delay the devils shall come out and\r\n    run about the stage; but some shall remain in hell.’\r\n\r\nThe shorter play of Cain and Abel is similarly conceived. The sacrifices\r\nare offered on two great stones ‘which shall have been made ready for\r\nthe purpose’; and at the end of the performance the devils hale off Cain\r\nand Abel also to hell ‘beating Cain often; but Abel they shall lead more\r\ngently.’ The prophets, who have been prepared in a secret spot, now\r\nadvance one by one and deliver their prophecies. Their appearance is\r\ndescribed much as in the earlier _Prophetae_, and it is noted that each\r\nin turn at the finish of his harangue is to be led off to hell by the\r\ndevils.\r\n\r\nUnless the _Adam_ extended much beyond the text left to us,\r\na comparatively small number of _loca_ would suffice for its\r\nrepresentation. The contemporary Anglo-Norman Resurrection play required\r\nthirteen, as is set out at length in a versified prologue:\r\n\r\n  ‘En ceste manere recitom\r\n  La seinte resurreccion.\r\n  Primerement apareillons\r\n  Tus les lius e les mansions:\r\n  Le crucifix primerement\r\n  E puis apres le monument.\r\n  Une jaiole i deit aver\r\n  Pur les prisons emprisoner.\r\n  Enfer seit mis de cele part,\r\n  E mansions de l’altre part,\r\n  E puis le ciel; et as estals\r\n  Primes Pilate od ces vassals.\r\n  Sis u set chivaliers aura.\r\n  Caïphas en l’altre serra;\r\n  Od lui seit la jeuerie,\r\n  Puis Joseph, cil d’Arimachie.\r\n  El quart liu seit danz Nichodemes.\r\n  Chescons i ad od sei les soens.\r\n  El quint les deciples Crist.\r\n  Les treis Maries saient el sist.\r\n  Si seit pourvéu que l’om face\r\n  Galilée en mi la place;\r\n  Jemaüs uncore i seit fait,\r\n  U Jhesu fut al hostel trait;\r\n  E cum la gent est tute asise,\r\n  E la pés de tutez parz mise,\r\n  Dan Joseph, cil d’Arimachie,\r\n  Venge a Pilate, si lui die.’\r\n\r\nI have ventured to arrange these _lius_ (_loca_) and _mansions_ (_domus_)\r\nor _estals_ (_sedes_), upon the indications of the prologue, in the\r\nfollowing plan:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd I would point out that such a scheme is simply a continuation of the\r\narrangement down the choir and nave of a church suggested above[273].\r\nThe crucifix is where it would stand in the church, above the altar. The\r\nplace of the monument corresponds to that most usual for the _sepulchrum_\r\non the north side of the chancel. The positions of heaven and hell are\r\nthose in the former case of the stairs up to the rood-loft, in the\r\nlatter of the stairs down to the crypt; and what, in a church, should\r\nserve for hell and heaven but crypt and rood-loft[274]? The Galilee\r\nanswers to the porch at the west end of the church, which we know to have\r\nbeen so called[275]; and the castle of Emmaus stands in the middle of\r\nthe nave, just as it did in the Fleury _Peregrini_. With my conjectural\r\nplan may be compared this actual plan of a sixteenth-century stage from\r\nDonaueschingen, in which a similar principle is apparent, the three\r\ndivisions formed by cross-barriers corresponding to the three divisions\r\nof a church—sanctuary, choir, nave[276].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF DONAUESCHINGEN PASSION-PLAY STAGE (_sixteenth\r\ncentury_).\r\n\r\n   A.

Cross of Christ.\r\n  21. The Holy Sepulchre.\r\n  22. Heaven.]\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Norman Resurrection play was pretty clearly out of doors[277];\r\nand the double line of _sedes_ may be thought of as stretching from the\r\nwest door of the church right across the market-place. In _Adam_ the\r\n_Figura_ comes and goes from and to the church, which thus serves for\r\na _ciel_; in the Benedictbeuern Christmas play, the chair of Augustine\r\nis set _in fronte ecclesiae_. This arrangement, also, can be paralleled\r\nfrom later plays, both French and German. At Freiburg in 1504 the stage\r\nwas built across the cathedral yard from the south door to the Kaufhaus,\r\na space of some 110 feet long[278]. At Rouen, in 1474, the _establies_\r\nwent across the market-place from the Axe and Crown to the Angel[279].\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that the rectangular stage survived as\r\nthe invariable type. In particular a round type was sometimes preferred.\r\nThe Cornish guary-plays were given in rounds, and a round is figured in a\r\nfifteenth-century miniature by Jean Fouquet, representing a play of Saint\r\nApollonia[280].\r\n\r\nI have spoken of a stage, but I am not sure that there was any stage in\r\nthe sense of a platform. There is certainly no such scaffold in Fouquet’s\r\nminiature, and the _plateae_ of the Fleury _Suscitatio Lazari_ and\r\nthe _Adam_ are probably only the open spaces kept free for the actors\r\nbetween the _sedes_[281]. In the _Adam_ the devils are able to make\r\nsallies from the _plateae_ amongst the spectators. The latter probably\r\ncrowded upon barriers between the _sedes_. In the miniature, however,\r\nthe _sedes_ stand close together and are considerably raised, with\r\nladders running up to them. The spectators stand beneath. The prologue\r\nto the Anglo-Norman _Resurrection_ speaks of _la gent_ as seated, and\r\npossibly raised scaffolds for the audience were already in use. These\r\nwere certainly known later, and the descriptions of some of them as\r\nno less than nine stories high have given rise to an erroneous theory\r\nthat the plays were performed upon a many-storied stage[282]. It is\r\nclear that this was not really the case. All the _sedes_ were on the\r\nsame level, except that, for greater dignity, the Calvary, the Heaven,\r\nthe Paradise might be, as in _Adam_, _loco eminentiore_, and that the\r\n_infernum_ or hell, conventionally represented by the head and open\r\ngullet of a monstrous dragon, was low down, as if in the bowels of the\r\nearth[283]. It should be added that, as early as the first quarter of\r\nthe twelfth century, plays had begun to make their way from the church,\r\nif not into the open, at any rate into buildings of domestic use. The\r\nauthority for this is Gerhoh of Reichersberg, who speaks of performances\r\nin the refectory of Augsburg, when he was _magister scolae_ there about\r\n1123[284]. Some of the Fleury or other early plays may conceivably have\r\nbeen intended for the refectory.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the cycles caused difficulties of time, as well as of\r\nspace. Without a compression of manner alien to the long-winded Middle\r\nAges, it was sometimes impossible to get the whole of the matter to be\r\ntreated within the limits of a single day. The problem was amenable to\r\nmore than one solution. The performance could be spread over two or\r\nmore sittings. The first recorded example of such an arrangement is at\r\nCividale in 1298[285], but it is one that would naturally suggest itself,\r\nespecially for the Easter cycle, which fell naturally enough into the two\r\ndramas of Passion and Resurrection, from which, indeed, it sprang. In\r\nthe Frankfort cue-book of the fourteenth century, it is carefully noted,\r\nthat if the audience are being kept too long, the _rectores_ of the play\r\nshall defer the Resurrection to a second day[286]. Another device, which\r\ndoes not occur so early, was to divide the cycle into parts and play them\r\nin successive years. This method was adopted with the play of the Seven\r\nJoys of Mary at Brussels[287], and English examples will be found in a\r\nlater chapter[288].\r\n\r\nThe cycles required in many cases a larger number of actors than the\r\necclesiastical bodies, even with the aid of wandering clerks and the\r\ncloister schools, could supply. It was necessary to press the laity into\r\nthe service. The Easter play, of which the thirteenth-century anchoress\r\nWilburgis was disappointed, was acted _tam a clero quam a populo_[289].\r\nIt was a further step in the same direction when the laity themselves\r\ntook over the control and financing of plays. For this one must look\r\nmainly to that most important element in mediaeval town life, the guilds.\r\nJust as the Feast of Fools passed from the hands of the clergy into\r\nthose of the _sociétés joyeuses_, so did the religious drama into those\r\nof more serious confraternities. The _burgenses_ of Cahors, who in 1290\r\nand 1302 played a _ludum de miraculis beati Marcialis_ in the graveyard\r\nof St. Martial of Limoges, not improbably belonged to a guild formed\r\nto do honour to the patron[290]. The primary purpose of such guilds as\r\nthese was devotional, and if they acted plays, it was doubtless with\r\nthe countenance and assistance of the clergy to whose church they were\r\naffiliated. But those more secular and literary guilds, the _puys_, also\r\nundertook to act religious plays no less than _sotties_ and farces; and\r\nin them it may be suspected that the influence of the clergy would have\r\nto contend shrewdly with that of the minstrels[291]. It is not surprising\r\nto come in time upon signs of a rivalry between lay and clerical actors.\r\nThus, in 1378, the scholars of St. Paul’s are said to have presented a\r\npetition to Richard II, praying him to prohibit a play by some ‘unexpert\r\npeople’ of the History of the Old Testament, a subject which they\r\nthemselves had prepared at great expense for the ensuing Christmas. It\r\nmay have been some similar dispute which led about the same date to the\r\nformation of the Parisian _Confrérie de la Passion_, which received from\r\nCharles VI a privilege to perform in and about the city, and became a\r\nmodel for many similar _confréries_ throughout France. The charter bears\r\nthe date of 1402. In 1398 the provost of Paris seems to have been moved\r\nto forbid dramatic performances without special sanction in the city\r\nor suburbs, a prohibition which, by the way, was flouted on the day of\r\nits proclamation at Saint-Maur. Exactly what led to this interposition\r\nof authority is not clear; but it probably induced the _confrérie_,\r\nwho may have had a previous less formal existence, to apply for their\r\nprivilege[292]. The _confrérie de la Passion_ seem to have acted, as a\r\nrule, in closed rooms. It is not unlikely that the _puys_ did the same.\r\n\r\nThe altered conditions of representation naturally reacted upon the style\r\nand temper of the plays themselves. This is not a subject that can be\r\ndiscussed in detail here, but a few points may be briefly noted. The\r\nfirst is the gradual substitution of vernacular tongues for the Latin of\r\nthe liturgical drama. This was almost inevitable, where laymen performed\r\nto a lay audience. But the liturgical drama itself did not absolutely\r\nexclude the vernacular. In the _Sponsus_, and in the _Suscitatio Lazari_\r\nand the Nicholas play of Hilarius, fragments of French are inserted,\r\njust as they are in the ‘farced’ epistles used at the feasts of certain\r\nsaints, notably at that of St. Stephen[293]. It was a step further when\r\nin the fourteenth century the nuns of Origny Ste.-Benoîte rewrote their\r\nliturgical _Quem quaeritis_, leaving indeed some of the more solemn\r\nparts, such as the dialogue of the Maries with the angel, or that of\r\nthe Magdalen with the risen Christ, in Latin, but turning the rest into\r\nFrench[294]. Such an arrangement as this of Origny Ste.-Benoîte became in\r\nthe transition plays, intended for out-of-door performance to a popular\r\naudience, the rule. There was naturally some local variation. Of the two\r\nlonger scholars’ plays in the Benedictbeuern manuscript, the Christmas\r\nplay is wholly, the Passion play mainly, in Latin. A large proportion of\r\nLatin seems to have been retained in the Frankfort Passion play of the\r\nfourteenth century. But on the whole, as the texts grow, and especially\r\nas they draw upon the apocryphal books or the great mediaeval vernacular\r\nepics for matter not in the liturgical plays, the vernacular steadily\r\ngets the upper hand, until in the latest versions the traces of Latin\r\nmust be regarded as mere survivals.\r\n\r\nIn some cases where Latin and vernacular appear together, the latter\r\nis of the nature of a translation, or rough and often much expanded\r\nparaphrase, of the former. This type of mixed and obviously transitional\r\ntext can, as it happens, be illustrated from French, German, and English\r\nsources. It occurs, for instance, in the _Adam_. Here the Adam and Eve\r\nand Cain and Abel scenes are wholly, but for the preliminary _lectio_ and\r\nthe interpolated chants by the choir, in Norman-French. The prophecies,\r\nhowever, are given in the double form. Thus Isaiah says:\r\n\r\n    ‘Egredietur virga de radice Jesse, et flos de radice eius\r\n    ascendet, et requiescet super eum spiritus domini.\r\n\r\n      ‘Or vus dirrai merveillus diz:\r\n      Jessé sera de sa raïz.\r\n      Verge en istra, qui fera flor,\r\n      Qui ert digne de grant unor.\r\n      Saint espirit l’avra si clos,\r\n      Sor ceste flor iert sun repos.’\r\n\r\nThere are many similar examples in German plays, of which the most\r\ncomplete is a _Quem quaeritis_ in a fourteenth-century manuscript at\r\nTrèves[295]. In England Professor Skeat discovered at Shrewsbury a\r\nfragmentary text of this type in a manuscript of the early fifteenth\r\ncentury[296]. It is written in a northern, probably Yorkshire, dialect,\r\nand contains the part, with cues, of a single actor in three plays, a\r\n_Pastores_, a _Quem quaeritis_, and a _Peregrini_. In the first he played\r\nthe Third Shepherd, in the second the Third Mary, in the last probably\r\nCleophas. The fragment shows clearly enough the way in which the Latin\r\ntext was first sung by a group of performers together, and then expanded\r\nby them separately in the vernacular. The two documents last quoted mark\r\nnot only the transition from Latin to the vernacular, but also that from\r\nthe sung drama of the liturgies to the spoken drama of the great cycles.\r\nIn Professor Skeat’s Shrewsbury fragments the Latin alone is musically\r\nnoted. In the Trèves _Quem quaeritis_ the Latin and portions of the\r\nGerman are noted, and a careful distinction is made between the lines\r\nto be spoken and those to be sung by the use of the terms _cantat_ and\r\n_dicit_ in the rubrics[297].\r\n\r\nAgain, the laicization of the drama was accompanied by a further\r\ndevelopment of the secular and even comic elements, of which the germs\r\nalready existed in the plays. A more human and less distinctively\r\necclesiastical handling became possible[298]. The figure of Herod\r\noffered a melodramatic type of ranting tyrant which the tradition of the\r\nstage did not readily forget. The life of the unconverted Magdalen _in\r\ngaudio_ gave the dramatist his opportunity to paint scenes of wholly\r\nsecular luxury and romance. Naturally the comic developments attached\r\nthemselves largely to personalities not already defined in the Testament\r\nnarratives. The _Mercator_, for instance, whose domesticities with his\r\nwife and his apprentice do so much to enliven the later German plays, is\r\na thoroughly characteristic production of the mediaeval folk spirit, for\r\nthe delectation of which Rutebeuf wrote the _Dit de l’Erberie_[299]. It\r\nis not, perhaps, altogether unjustifiable to trace a relation between him\r\nand the inveterate quack doctor of the spring folk drama itself[300].\r\nThis would not be the only point of contact between the _ludi_ of the\r\nChurch and those of the folk. The significance, from this point of view,\r\nof Balaam’s ass has already been touched upon[301]. And in the growth of\r\nthe devil scenes, from their first beginnings in the _Sponsus_ or in the\r\ndevil-deacon of the _Tollite portas_[302], to their importance in the\r\n_Adam_ or the various treatments of the Fall of Lucifer and the Harrowing\r\nof Hell, may we not trace the influence of those masked and blackened\r\ndemon figures who from all time had been a dear scandal of the Kalends\r\nand the Feast of Fools[303]? It is certain that the imps who sallied\r\namongst the spectators and haled the Fathers off to their limbo of\r\nclashed kettles and caldrons must have been an immensely popular feature\r\nof the _Adam_; and it is noteworthy that in more than one place the\r\n_compagnies joyeuses_ who inherited the Feast of Fools joined forces with\r\nmore serious _confréries_ and provided comic actors for the religious\r\nplays[304].\r\n\r\nIn yet another way the coming of the vernacular affected the character\r\nof the religious drama. It had been cosmopolitan; it was to be\r\nnational: and from the fourteenth century, in spite of a few lendings\r\nand borrowings, and of a certain uniformity in the general lines of\r\ndevelopment, it really requires separate treatment in each of the\r\nEuropean countries[305]. In Italy the divergence from the common type\r\nwas perhaps most marked of all, although I think that Signor D’Ancona\r\nand others have perhaps pushed the doctrine of the independence and\r\nisolation of Italian drama to an extreme. They consider that it almost\r\nbegan afresh with the religious stirrings of the Umbrian Flagellants\r\nin 1260. The _compagnie_ or associations of _disciplinati_, who were\r\nthe outcome of this thoroughly folk movement, were wont, as they\r\nlashed themselves, to sing hymns of praise, _laudes_, whence they got\r\nthe secondary name of _laudesi_. The lauds were mostly sung in the\r\nchapels of the _compagnie_ after mass and a sermon on Sundays. Several\r\nfourteenth-century collections are extant, and contain examples intended\r\nfor use throughout the circle of the ecclesiastical year. Many of them\r\nwere dialogued, and appear to have been recited in costume with scenic\r\naccessories. The dramatic lauds were specifically known as _devozioni_,\r\nand by the end of the fourteenth century were in some cases performed\r\nrather elaborately upon a _talamo_ or stage in the nave of a church,\r\nwith _luoghi deputati_ for the accommodation of the chief actors.\r\nAccording to Signor D’Ancona, the _devozioni_, which were composed by\r\npoor folk, were taken direct from the liturgy and owed little more than\r\nthe initial hint or impulse to the liturgical drama; while at the other\r\nend of these developments, they became the source of the out-of-door\r\nand splendidly-staged _sacre rappresentazioni_ which originated in\r\nFlorence in the fifteenth century and thence spread to other Italian\r\ncities[306]. On this theory it must be observed that the _devozioni_ have\r\nnot been shown to be independent of the liturgical drama, and that the\r\nderivation of the _sacre rappresentazioni_ from the _devozioni_ is purely\r\nconjectural. The _sacre rappresentazioni_ were out of doors and produced\r\nby the clergy or laity; the _devozioni_, which have not been traced to\r\nFlorence, were produced indoors by religious guilds of a very distinct\r\ntype. The _sacre rappresentazioni_, moreover, included subjects, such\r\nas the _profeti_, which are not within the cycle of the _devozioni_,\r\nbut do belong to the liturgical drama. It is at least a tenable view,\r\nthat the _devozioni_ were merely a backwater of the drama, and that the\r\n_sacre rappresentazioni_ were derived, like the fifteenth-century plays\r\nof other countries, from the liturgical drama through the medium of such\r\ntransitional types as those already noted at Padua, Siena, and Cividale.\r\nThe fact that the only transitional texts preserved are those of the\r\n_devozioni_ has perhaps led to an exaggerated estimate of the importance\r\nof these. Even liturgical dramas are rare in Italy, although there are\r\nsufficient thoroughly to establish their existence. The chroniclers,\r\nhowever, mention one or two events which point to another dramatic\r\ntradition in Italy than that of the _devozioni_. At Florence itself, in\r\n1306, there was a show of Heaven and Hell upon the Arno, which though\r\nmerely pantomimic, may have been based on some dramatic representation\r\nof the Last Judgement[307]. At Milan, in 1336, was a _Stella_, in which\r\nthe _Magi_ rode through the streets, and Herod sat by the columns of\r\nSan Lorenzo[308]. Both of these performances, like those at Padua and\r\nCividale and the _sacre rappresentazioni_ themselves, were out of doors.\r\nIt is true that the _sacre rappresentazioni_ fell less into big cycles\r\nthan did the contemporary plays of other countries: but cycles were not\r\nunknown[309], and it must be borne in mind that the extreme beauty and\r\nelaboration of the Florentine _mise-en-scène_ made a limited scheme, on\r\ngrounds both of time and expense, almost imperative.\r\n\r\nWith out-of-door plays climatic conditions began to be of importance.\r\nEven in sunny France, Christmas is not exactly the season to hang about\r\nthe market-place looking at an interminable drama. It is not to be\r\ndenied that Christmas plays continued to be occasionally acted well\r\nthrough the fifteenth century[310], but the number of these, compared\r\nwith the Passions, is small[311]. Even Easter weather is not invariably\r\ngenial. Nor, as the cycles lengthened, was the attachment of them to\r\nany one of the feasts, whose events they commemorated, a matter of\r\nfirst-rate importance. A tendency set in towards playing them as far\r\nas possible in the long warm days of the summer months. The first\r\nWhitsuntide performances are those at Cividale in 1298 and 1303; and\r\nWhitsuntide became a very favourite date[312]. At Florence the great\r\npatronal feast and procession of St. John the Baptist on June 24 was a\r\nnatural occasion for _sacre rappresentazioni_[313]. Another high day\r\nfor the cyclical drama from the fourteenth century onwards, notably in\r\nEngland[314] and Spain[315], and to a much less degree in Germany[316]\r\nand France[317], was the recently-established feast of Corpus Christi.\r\nThis, the most materialistic of all the Church’s celebrations, is in\r\nhonour of the mystery of the transubstantiated sacrament. It originated\r\nlocally in an alleged revelation to Juliana, a Cistercian religious of\r\nLiège. Pope Urban IV designed in 1264 to make it a universal festival,\r\nbut he died in the same year, and the bull which he had issued remained\r\ninoperative until it was confirmed by Clement V at the council of Vienne\r\nin 1311. Corpus Christi day was the Thursday after Trinity Sunday.\r\nAn office was compiled for it by St. Thomas Aquinas, and the leading\r\nceremony was a great procession in which the host, escorted by local\r\ndignitaries, religious bodies and guilds, was borne through the streets\r\nand displayed successively at out-of-door stations[318]. When the plays\r\nwere transferred to Corpus Christi day, they became more or less attached\r\nto this procession. Sometimes, perhaps, the procession served as a mere\r\npreliminary parade for the actors, such as sometimes preceded plays at\r\nother times[319]. The play itself would follow on a fixed stage of the\r\nordinary type. But the method of the great English cycles seems to point\r\nto a more complete merging of play and procession than this. The _domus_,\r\n_loci_, or _sedes_ were set upon wheels, and known as ‘pageants[320]’;\r\nand the performance was gone through during the procession, being\r\nrepeated at the various stations made by the host. If the cycle was a\r\nvery long one, time could be saved by making an early play at one station\r\ncoincident with a later play at that in front of it. It is, however,\r\neasy to see that with the arrangement here suggested the popularity of\r\nthe pageants might throw the strictly religious aspect of the procession\r\nrather into the shade. The two would then be severed again, but the play\r\nmight still retain its processional character. This is not, I think, an\r\nunreasonable conjecture as to how the type of play found, say at York,\r\nmay have come into existence[321]. To Chester, where the plays were not\r\non Corpus Christi day, but at Whitsuntide, the method must have been\r\ntransferred at a later date.\r\n\r\nDuring this brief survey of the critical period for the religious drama\r\nbetween the middle of the thirteenth and the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, I have attempted to bring into relief the tendencies that were\r\nat work for its remodelling. But it must not be supposed that either\r\nthe tendency to expansion or the tendency to secularization acted\r\nuniversally and uniformly. The truth is quite otherwise. To the end of\r\nthe history of the religious drama, the older types, which it threw out\r\nas it evolved, co-existed with the newer ones[322]. The Latin tropes and\r\nliturgical dramas held their place in the church services. And in the\r\nvernaculars, side by side with the growing Nativities and Passions, there\r\ncontinued to be acted independent plays of more than one sort. There\r\nwere the original short plays, such as the _Stella_, the _Annunciation_,\r\nthe _Sponsus_, the _Antichrist_, by the running together of which the\r\ncycles came into being. There were plays, on the other hand, which\r\noriginated as episodes in the cycles, and only subsequently attained\r\nto an independent existence. The majority of these were Old Testament\r\nplays, budded off, like the _Daniel_, from the _Prophetae_. And finally\r\nthere were numerous plays drawn from hagiological legends, many of which\r\nnever came into connexion with the cycles at all. Thus in the transition\r\nperiod we find, not only plays on St. Nicholas and St. Catherine for\r\nwhich liturgical models existed, but also the great French series of\r\nMiracles of the Virgin, and plays on Saints Theophilus, Dorothy, Martial,\r\nand Agnes[323]. The natural tendency of great churches to magnify their\r\nown patron saints led to further multiplication of themes. In the same\r\nway, long after the lay guilds and corporations had taken up the drama,\r\nperformances continued to be given or superintended by the clergy and\r\ntheir scholars[324]. Priests and monks supplied texts and lent vestments\r\nfor the lay plays. To the last, the church served from time to time as\r\na theatre. All these points, as well as the traces of their liturgical\r\norigin lingering in the cycles, will be fully illustrated, so far as\r\nEngland is concerned, in the following chapters.\r\n\r\nThe question presents itself: What was the official attitude of the high\r\necclesiastical authorities towards the growing religious plays? It is\r\nnot precisely answered, as the history of the Feast of Fools has shown,\r\nby the fact that the chapters and inferior clergy encouraged and took\r\npart in them. The liturgical drama had its motive, as St. Ethelwold\r\nis careful to point out, in a desire for devotion and the edification\r\nof the vulgar[325]. The hope of affording a counter-attraction to\r\nthe spring and winter _ludi_ of hard-dying paganism probably went for\r\nsomething. Herrad of Landsberg, in the twelfth century, utters a regret\r\nthat the _Stella_ rightly instituted at Epiphany by the Fathers of\r\nthe Church had given place to a shameless revel[326]. But a contrary\r\nopinion to Herrad’s arose almost contemporaneously amongst the reforming\r\nanti-imperial clergy of Germany. This finds expression more than once\r\nin the writings of Gerhoh of Reichersberg[327]. He scoffs at the monks\r\nof Augsburg who, when he was _magister scolae_ there about 1122, could\r\nonly be induced to sup in the refectory, when a representation of Herod\r\nor the Innocents or some other quasi-theatrical spectacle made an excuse\r\nfor a feast[328]. And he devotes a chapter of his _De Investigatione\r\nAntichristi_, written about 1161, to an argument that clergy who turn\r\nthe churches into theatres are doing the work of that very Antichrist\r\nof whom they make a show[329]. Evidently Gerhoh has been stung by the\r\nlampooning of his party as the _Hypocritae_ in the pro-imperialist\r\n_Antichristus_ which is still extant. But he includes in his condemnation\r\nplays of a less special and polemical character, referring especially\r\nto the Nativity cycle and to a lost play of _Elisaeus_. He repeats some\r\nof the old patristic objections against _larvae_ and _spectacula_, and\r\ntells tales, such as Prynne will tell after him, of how horrors mimicked\r\nby actors have been miraculously converted into verities[330]. Literary\r\nhistorians occasionally commit themselves to the statement that Innocent\r\nIII forbade the clergy to participate in miracle-plays[331]. It is\r\nmore than doubtful whether this was so. The prohibition in question\r\nis familiar to us, and it is clear that the _ludi theatrales_ which\r\nInnocent barred from the churches were primarily the Feasts of Fools,\r\nand the like[332]. And as a matter of fact the _glossa ordinaria_ to the\r\ndecretal by Bernard de Bottone, which itself dates from about 1263, so\r\ninterprets the words of the Pope as expressly to allow of Christmas and\r\nEaster representations calculated to stimulate devotion[333]. Yet there\r\nwould have been no need for the gloss to have been written had not an\r\nopposite interpretation also been current. It was perhaps on the strength\r\nof the decree that another reformer, Robert Grosseteste, justified his\r\naction when in 1244 he directed his archdeacons to exterminate, so\r\nfar as they could, the _miracula_, which he put on the same level as\r\nMay-games and harvest-Mays, or the _scotales_ of the folk[334]. And it\r\nis certainly appealed to before the end of the thirteenth century in\r\nthe _Manuel des Péchés_ of the Anglo-Norman William of Waddington[335].\r\nRobert Grosseteste presumably, and William of Waddington specifically,\r\nobjected to _miracula_ even out of doors, which is surely stretching the\r\nwords of Innocent III beyond what they will reasonably bear. In any case\r\nthe austere view of the matter was not that which prevailed. The lax\r\ndiscipline of the ‘Babylonish captivity’ at Avignon, which allowed the\r\nFeast of Fools to grow up unchecked through the fourteenth century, was\r\nnot likely to boggle at the plays. The alleged indulgence, not without\r\nmodern parallels[336], of Clement VI to the spectators of the Chester\r\nplays and the performance of a _Stella_ given by the English bishops in\r\nhonour of their continental colleagues at the council of Constance in\r\n1417[337] are two out of many proofs that the later mediaeval Church\r\nfound no difficulty in accommodating itself to the somewhat disconcerting\r\nby-product of its own liturgy[338]. Such opposition to the religious\r\ndrama as can be traced after the thirteenth century came not from the\r\nheads of the Church but from its heretics. It is chiefly represented\r\nby a curious _Tretise of miraclis pleyinge_ which dates from the end\r\nof the fourteenth century and may safely be referred to a Wyclifite\r\norigin[339]. The burden of it is the sin of making ‘oure pleye and bourde\r\nof tho myraclis and werkis that God so ernestfully wrouȝt to us.’ On this\r\nnote the anonymous preacher harps rather monotonously, and adds that\r\n‘myraclis pleyinge ... makith to se veyne siȝtis of degyse, aray of men\r\nand wymmen by yvil continaunse, eyther stiryng othere to letcherie and of\r\ndebatis.’ Like Gerhoh of Reichersberg, he thinks the plays ‘gynnys of the\r\ndyvul to drawen men to the byleve of Anti-Crist.’ He elaborately confutes\r\nthe views that they are for the worship of God, or the more compassion of\r\nChrist, or lead to conversion. He will not allow that ‘summe recreatioun\r\nmen moten han, and bettere it is or lesse yvele that thei han theyre\r\nrecreacoun by pleyinge of myraclis than bi pleyinge of other japis.’ The\r\nanalysis of the piece need not, perhaps, be pushed further. The opinions\r\nexpressed do not appear to have had any weight either of popular or of\r\necclesiastical sentiment behind them; but they curiously antedate the\r\nhistriomastic tracts of many a sixteenth and seventeenth-century Puritan.\r\n\r\nThis chapter may be fitly closed by a few words on the subject\r\nof nomenclature[340]. The old classical terms of _tragoedia_ and\r\n_comoedia_ are not of course normally used of the religious plays until\r\nthe Renaissance influences come in towards the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Their mediaeval sense, in fact, implies nothing distinctively\r\ndramatic[341]. The liturgical plays have often a purely liturgical\r\nheading, such as _Processio Asinorum_[342], or _Officium Sepulchri_[343],\r\nor _Ordo Rachaelis_[344]. Perhaps _officium_ may be taken to denote\r\nthe thing itself, the special service or section of a service; _ordo_\r\nrather the book, the written directions for carrying out the _officium_.\r\nOr they have a title derived from their subject, such as _Visitatio\r\nSepulchri_[345], or _Suscitatio Lazari_[346]. Or they are introduced\r\nin terms which cannot be said to have a technical signification at\r\nall, _ad faciendam similitudinem_[347], _ad suscipiendum_[348], _ad\r\nrepraesentandum_[349]. _Similitudo_ I do not find outside Fleury, nor\r\nthe corresponding _exemplum_ outside the Benedictbeuern manuscript[350].\r\nFrom _ad repraesentandum_, however, a technical term does arise, and\r\n_repraesentatio_ must be considered, more than any other word, as the\r\nmediaeval Latin equivalent of ‘dramatic performance[351].’ This the\r\nItalian vernacular preserves as _rappresentazione_. A synonym for\r\n_repraesentatio_, which naturally came into use when the intention of\r\nrecreation began to substitute itself for devotion, is _ludus_, with its\r\nvernacular renderings, all in common use, of _jeu_, _Spiel_, ‘play.’ But\r\n_ludus_, as already pointed out[352], is a generic term for ‘amusement,’\r\nand the special sense of ‘dramatic play’ is only a secondary one[353].\r\n‘Clerks’ play’ as a variant for miracle-play is occasionally found[354].\r\nYet another synonym which makes its appearance in the twelfth century,\r\nis _miraculum_; and this, originally a mere convenient shorthand for\r\n_repraesentatio miraculi_, came, especially in England, to stand for\r\n‘religious play’ in general[355]. _Mystère_, or ‘mystery,’ on the other\r\nhand, is not English at all, in a dramatic sense[356], and in France\r\nfirst appears as _misterie_ in the charter given by Charles VI in 1402\r\nto the Parisian _confrérie de la Passion_[357]. This term also acquires\r\na very general signification by the end of the fifteenth century. Its\r\nradical meaning is still matter of dispute. Probably it is derived from\r\n_ministerium_, should be spelt _mistère_, and is spelt _mystère_ by\r\na natural confusion with the derivative of μυστήριον. Even then the\r\nquestion remains, what sort of _ministerium_? M. Petit de Julleville\r\nwould explain it as a ‘religious function,’ and thus equate it precisely\r\nwith _officium_[358]. Only it does not appear in connexion with the\r\nliturgical plays[359], and perhaps it is more plausible to regard it\r\nas denoting the ‘function’ of the guild of actors, just as its doublet\r\n_menestrie_, the English ‘minstrelsy,’ denotes the ‘function’ of the\r\nminstrels[360], or its doublet _métier_, which in English becomes in fact\r\n‘mystery,’ denotes the ‘function’ of the craft guilds. Perhaps the theory\r\nof M. de Julleville finds a little support from the term _actio_, which\r\nappears, besides its meaning in connexion with the Mass[361], to be once\r\nat least used for a play[362]. At any rate _actus_ is so used as a Latin\r\nequivalent of the Spanish _auto_[363].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nGUILD PLAYS AND PARISH PLAYS\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._—The English miracle play has been\r\n    often, fully, and admirably studied from the point of view\r\n    of dramatic literature; perhaps less so from that of stage\r\n    history. The best accounts are those of B. Ten Brink,\r\n    _History of English Literature_, bk. v, chs. 2-6 (trans. W.\r\n    C. Robinson, vol. ii, 1893); A. W. Ward, _History of English\r\n    Dramatic Literature_ (2nd ed., 1899), vol. i, ch. 1; W.\r\n    Creizenach, _Geschichte des neueren Dramas_, vol. i (1893);\r\n    and the introduction to A. W. Pollard, _English Miracle Plays,\r\n    Moralities and Interludes_ (3rd ed., 1898). These supersede\r\n    J. P. Collier, _History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (2nd ed.,\r\n    1879), vol. ii, and J. L. Klein, _Geschichte des englischen\r\n    Dramas_ (1876), vol. i. Other useful books are J. A. Symonds,\r\n    _Shakspere’s Predecessors in the English Drama_ (1884), ch.\r\n    3; K. L. Bates, _The English Religious Drama_ (1893), and J.\r\n    J. Jusserand, _Le Théâtre en Angleterre_ (1881), ch. 2. The\r\n    substance of this last is incorporated in the same writer’s\r\n    _Literary History of the English People_, vol. i (1895), bk.\r\n    iii, ch. 6. W. J. Courthope, _History of English Poetry_,\r\n    vol. i (1895), ch. 10, should also be consulted, as well as\r\n    the valuable detailed investigations of A. Hohlfeld, _Die\r\n    altenglischen Kollektivmisterien_, in _Anglia_, vol. xi (1889),\r\n    and C. Davidson, _Studies in the English Mystery Plays_\r\n    (1892). I do not think that S. W. Clarke, _The Miracle Play\r\n    in England_ (n.d.), and C. Hastings, _Le Théâtre français\r\n    et anglais_ (1900, trans. 1901), add very much. A. Ebert,\r\n    _Die englischen Mysterien_, in _Jahrbuch für romanische und\r\n    englische Literatur_, vol. i (1859), is an early manifestation\r\n    of German interest in the subject, and the still earlier native\r\n    learning may be found in T. Warton, _History of English Poetry_\r\n    (ed. W. C. Hazlitt, 1871), §§ 6, 33; E. Malone, _Historical\r\n    Account of the English Stage_, in _Variorum Shakespeare_\r\n    (1821), vol. iii; W. Hone, _Ancient Mysteries Described_\r\n    (1823). The antiquarianism of T. Sharp, _Dissertation on the\r\n    Pageants or Dramatic Mysteries Anciently Performed at Coventry_\r\n    (1825), is still a mine of material on the _Realien_ of the\r\n    stage.—The four great cycles have been edited as follows, in\r\n    most cases with important introductions: the _Chester Plays_ by\r\n    T. Wright (_Shakespeare Society_, 1843-7) and by H. Deimling\r\n    (_E. E. T. S._, part only issued in 1893); the _York Plays_\r\n    by L. T. Smith (1885); the _Towneley_ or _Wakefield Plays_\r\n    by an uncertain editor (_Surtees Society_, 1836), and by G.\r\n    England and A. W. Pollard (_E. E. T. S._ 1897); the _Ludus\r\n    Coventriae_, by J. O. Halliwell [-Phillipps] (_Shakespeare\r\n    Society_, 1841). A miscellaneous collection of late plays\r\n    from one of the _Bodleian Digby MSS._ has been printed by T.\r\n    Sharp (_Abbotsford Club_, 1835), and F. J. Furnivall (_New\r\n    Shakespeare Society_, 1882, _E. E. T. S._ 1896). The Cornish\r\n    cycle is in E. Norris, _The Ancient Cornish Drama_ (1859).\r\n    Good selections of typical plays are in A. W. Pollard’s book,\r\n    and J. M. Manly, _Specimens of the Pre-Shakespearean Drama_\r\n    (1897), vol. i. Older books of the same kind are J. P. Collier,\r\n    _Five Miracle Plays, or Scriptural Dramas_ (1836), and W.\r\n    Marriott, _A Collection of English Miracle Plays or Mysteries_\r\n    (Basle, 1838). The bibliographies given by Miss Bates and by\r\n    F. H. Stoddard, _References for Students of Miracle Plays and\r\n    Mysteries_ (1887), may be supplemented from my _Appendices of\r\n    Representations_ and _Texts_, which I have tried to make as\r\n    complete as possible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt that England had its full share in the\r\nearlier development of the religious drama. Texts of the liturgical\r\nperiod are, indeed, rare. The tenth-century version of the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_ from Winchester and the fourteenth-century version from Dublin\r\nstand, at least for the present, alone. But the wholesale destruction of\r\nliturgical books at the Reformation is sufficient to account for such\r\na sparseness, and a few stray notices gathered from the wreckage of\r\ntime bear sufficient witness to the presence in this country of several\r\namongst the more widespread types of liturgical play. The Lichfield\r\nstatutes (1188-98) provide for _repraesentationes_ of the _Pastores_, the\r\n_Resurrectio_, the _Peregrini_; those of York (†1255) for the _Pastores_\r\nand the _Tres Reges_; a Salisbury inventory of 1222 includes ‘crowns’\r\nor more probably ‘stars’ (_coronae_) _ad repraesentationes faciendas_;\r\nwhile Lincoln account books of the early fifteenth century appear to\r\nadd the _Annuntiatio_ and the _Prophetae_, a _visus_ called _Rubum quem\r\nviderat_ in 1420 perhaps forming a Moses scene in the latter. So late as\r\n1518 the _Quem quaeritis_ was performed in Magdalen College chapel, and\r\nplays of the Nativity and the Resurrection by the clerks of the chapel\r\nare contemplated at about the same date in the household regulations of\r\nthe Earl of Northumberland at Leconfield. Nor were dramatic versions of\r\nthe legends of saints unknown. I do not trace a St. Nicholas cycle in\r\nEngland, although Hilarius, in whose repertory a St. Nicholas play is\r\nincluded, is thought to have been an Englishman by birth. But the memory\r\nof a play of St. Catherine prepared by Geoffrey the Norman at Dunstable\r\nearly in the twelfth century was preserved, owing to the accident which\r\nled to Geoffrey ultimately becoming abbot of St. Albans; and towards the\r\nclose of the same century William Fitzstephen records the representations\r\nof the miracles of holy confessors and the passions of martyrs which took\r\nthe place of minstrelsy in London. For the most part such early plays\r\nare found in close connexion with the cathedrals and great monasteries.\r\nBut a document of about 1220, the interpretation of which must, however,\r\nbe considered doubtful, would seem to suggest that plays (_actiones_)\r\nwere habitually given at no less than five chapelries within the single\r\nparish of Shipton in Oxfordshire, and that the profits thereof formed\r\nan appreciable part of the income derived from that living by the\r\nprebendaries of Salisbury cathedral.\r\n\r\nExamples of the transitional forms by which the liturgical drama grew\r\ninto the popular religious drama of the great cycles can also be found\r\nin England. At Beverley a Resurrection play is described as taking\r\nplace in the graveyard of the minster about 1220. The intrusion of the\r\nvernacular is represented by the curious bilingual text of a single\r\nactor’s parts in the _Pastores_, _Quem quaeritis_ and _Peregrini_,\r\nprinted by Professor Skeat from a manuscript found at Shrewsbury. These\r\nare probably still liturgical in character, and it is to be observed\r\nthat their subjects are precisely those of the three plays known to\r\nhave been used in the neighbouring cathedral of Lichfield. It must\r\nremain a moot point whether the religious drama passed directly, in this\r\ncountry, from Latin to English, or whether there was a period during\r\nwhich performances were given in Norman-French. Scholars are inclined\r\nto find an Anglo-Norman dialect in that very important monument of the\r\ntransition, the _Repraesentatio Adae_, as well as in an early example of\r\nthe expanded Easter play. But even if the authors of these were, like\r\nHilarius, of English birth, it hardly follows that their productions\r\nwere acted in England. Nor do the probable borrowings of the Chester and\r\nother cycles from French texts much affect the question[364]. That the\r\ndisfavour with which the austerer section of the clergy looked upon the\r\nvernacular religious plays had its spokesmen in England, was sufficiently\r\nillustrated in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe English miracle-play reaches its full development with the\r\nformation of the great processional cycles almost immediately after the\r\nestablishment of the Corpus Christi festival in 1311. The local tradition\r\nof Chester, stripped of a certain confusion between the names of two\r\ndistinct mayors of that city which has clung about it, is found to fix\r\nthe foundation of the Chester plays in 1328. The date has the authority\r\nof an official municipal document, forms part of a quite consistent\r\nstory, several points in which can be independently corroborated, and\r\nis on _a priori_ grounds extremely plausible. Unfortunately, owing to\r\nthe comparative scarcity of archives during this period, the first\r\nfifty years of the history of municipal drama are practically a blank.\r\nA mention, about 1350, of a _ludus filiorum Israelis_, in connexion\r\nwith a guild of Corpus Christi at Cambridge, spans a wide gulf. There\r\nis no actual record of plays at Chester itself until 1462. Those of\r\nBeverley are first mentioned in 1377, those of York in 1378, and those\r\nof Coventry in 1392. But it must be added that the Beverley plays were\r\nan _antiqua consuetudo_ in 1390, and that those of York were to take\r\nplace at stations _antiquitus assignatis_ in 1394. It is in 1378 that\r\nthe earliest notice of plays in London, since the days of William\r\nFitzstephen, comes to light. The fuller records which are from this\r\ntime onward available reveal, during the next hundred and fifty years,\r\na vigorous and widespread dramatic activity throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of the land. It manifests itself at such extreme points as the\r\nCinque Ports in the east, Cornwall in the west, and Newcastle in the\r\nnorth. It penetrates to Aberdeen and to Dublin. And though naturally\r\nit finds its fullest scope in the annually repeated performances of\r\nseveral amongst the greater cities, yet it is curious to observe in\r\nwhat insignificant villages it was from time to time found possible to\r\norganize plays. Performers from thirteen neighbouring places, many of\r\nthem quite small, made their way to New Romney between 1399 and 1508;\r\nwhilst the churchwardens of Chelmsford, in the twelve years after their\r\nown play in 1562, reaped a profit by hiring out their stock of garments\r\nto the men of some seventeen aspiring parishes. On the other hand,\r\nthere were several important towns in which, so far as we can judge\r\nfrom documents, such as craft ordinances, which would almost certainly\r\nhave referred to the plays of the crafts, if these had existed, the\r\nnormal type of municipal drama failed to establish itself. London is\r\none, although here the want was supplied in another way; others are\r\nNorthampton, Nottingham, Bristol, Oxford, and Reading. And occasionally\r\nplays, which had once been annual, were allowed to fall into desuetude\r\nand decay. The corporation of Canterbury, for instance, called upon the\r\ncrafts about 1500 to revive a Corpus Christi play which for some time\r\nhad been ‘left and laid apart.’ Certainly, by the sixteenth century, if\r\nthere was still pride and interest taken in many of the municipal plays,\r\nsigns were not wanting that they were an institution which had almost\r\noutlived its day. A reason for this need hardly be sought beyond the\r\n_Zeitgeist_. No doubt the plays were a financial burden upon the poorer\r\ncrafts and the poorer members of crafts. There was much grumbling at\r\nBeverley in 1411 because certain well-to-do persons (_generosi_), who did\r\nnot practise any trade or handicraft, had hitherto escaped the payment\r\nof contributions to the civic function; and municipal authorities were\r\nconstantly called upon to adjust and readjust the responsibility for this\r\nand that pageant with the fluctuations of prosperity amongst the various\r\noccupations. But on the other hand, the plays, were the cause of much\r\nand profitable resort to those fortunate towns which possessed them. The\r\nmercers’ guild at Shrewsbury found it necessary to impose a special fine\r\nupon those of its members whose business avocations required them ‘to\r\nride or goe to Coventrie Faire’ at Corpus Christi tide, and so to miss\r\nthe procession of guilds at home[365]. And although the mayor of Coventry\r\nwrote to Thomas Cromwell, in 1539, that the poor commoners were put to\r\nsuch expense with their plays and pageants that they fared the worse all\r\nthe year after, yet against this may be set the statement made to Dugdale\r\nby ‘some old people who had in their younger days been eye-witnesses of\r\nthese pageants’ that ‘the confluence of people from farr and neare to\r\nsee that shew was extraordinary great, and yeilded noe small advantage\r\nto this cittye.’ Moreover the levy upon individuals was a trifling one;\r\nthe whole of the company of smiths at Coventry only paid 3_s._ 4_d._\r\namongst them for ‘pagent pencys’ in 1552. A _leitourgia_ is always an\r\nunpopular institution, and these complaints resemble nothing so much as\r\nthe groans of an opulent London tradesman in the twentieth century over\r\nan extra penny on the education rate. In the smaller places it is clear\r\nthat plays, far from being a source of expense, were a recognized method\r\nof raising funds for public purposes. Even in 1220 the _emolumentum\r\nactionum_ from the chapelries of Shipton went to swell the purses of the\r\nSalisbury prebendaries. In 1505 the churchwardens of Kingston-on-Thames\r\nmade £4 towards their new steeple by getting up a play for which they\r\nsecured the patronage of royalty. At Braintree, in Essex, funds were\r\nsimilarly raised by Nicholas Udall and others, between 1523 and 1534,\r\nfor the repair of the church. I have little doubt that when the mayor\r\nof Coventry said economy he meant Protestantism, just as when, under\r\nElizabeth, the corporation of London wished to make a Puritanic attack\r\nupon the theatres, they were always smitten with a terrible dread of the\r\ninfection of the plague[366].\r\n\r\nCertainly the spirit of Protestantism, although it came to be willing to\r\nuse the religious drama for its own purposes[367], was inclined to see\r\nboth profanity and superstition in the ordinary miracle-plays[368]. Here,\r\nas elsewhere, it inherited the hostile tradition which such reforming\r\nclerics as Gerhoh of Reichersberg in the twelfth century and Robert\r\nGrosseteste in the thirteenth had handed down to Wyclif and his Lollards.\r\nAt Bungay in 1514 certain ill-disposed persons ‘brake and threw down five\r\npageants’ usually borne about the town on Corpus Christi day. One may\r\nfairly suspect, even at this early date, a Lollardist intention in the\r\noutrage, and perhaps also in the interposition of the authority of the\r\nwarden of the Cinque Ports to suppress the play of New Romney in 1518.\r\nWith the progress of the new ideas the big cycles began to be irregularly\r\nperformed or to undergo textual modification. The plays of York, for\r\nexample, were shorn in 1548 of the pageants representing the Death,\r\nAssumption, and Coronation of the Virgin. On the other hand, religious\r\nplays sometimes became a rallying-point for those who favoured the old\r\norder of things. There is extant a letter from Henry VIII to the justices\r\nof York, in which he refers to a riot promoted by certain papists at a\r\nplay of St. Thomas the Apostle, and warns them not to suffer upon such\r\noccasions any language likely to tend to a breach of the peace. The brief\r\nMarian reaction led to the resumption of the plays in more than one town\r\nwhich had dropped them. The Lincoln corporation ordered ‘St. Anne’s Gild\r\nwith Corpus Cristi play’ to be brought forward again in 1554 and 1555.\r\nIn London Henry Machyn records during 1557 a Passion play at the Grey\r\nFriars, and another in the church of St. Olave’s, Silver Street, on the\r\nfestival of the patron. The New Romney play was elaborately revived,\r\nafter forty-two years’ interval, in 1560. But the process of decay soon\r\nset in again. Even where the plays survived, they were Protestantized,\r\nand as Corpus Christi day was no longer observed, the performances had to\r\nbe transferred to some other date. At York the text of the Corpus Christi\r\nplay was ‘perused and otherwise amended’ in 1568. In 1569 it was acted\r\nupon Whit-Tuesday. Then it lay by until 1579, when the book was referred\r\nto the archbishop and dean for further revision, and apparently impounded\r\nby them. The Creed play was suppressed, by advice of the dean, in 1568,\r\nas unsuitable to ‘this happie time of the gospell.’ The _Paternoster_\r\nplay was revised and played in 1572. Then this text also fell into the\r\nhands of the archbishop, and the corporation seem to have been unable\r\nto recover it. So ended the religious drama in York. In Chester the\r\nmunicipal authorities stood out gallantly for their plays. John Hankey\r\nand Sir John Savage, mayors in 1572 and 1575 respectively, were called\r\nbefore the privy council for sanctioning performances in spite of\r\ninhibitions from the archbishop of York and other persons of authority.\r\nThey had revised the text, and had a new and Protestant version of the\r\npreliminary ‘banns’ prepared. Copies of the text appear to have been\r\ngot ready for yet another performance in 1600, but the local annalists\r\nrecord that Henry Hardware, then mayor, ‘would not suffer any Playes.’ In\r\none or two cities, new plays, dealing with apocryphal or other merely\r\nsemi-religious themes, were substituted for the old ones. Thus at Lincoln\r\na ‘standing play’ of the story of Tobit was given in 1564 and 1567; and\r\nin Coventry, where the old cycle had been ‘laid down’ in 1580, an Oxford\r\nscholar was hired in 1584 to write a semi-religious semi-historical drama\r\nof the Destruction of Jerusalem. In 1591, the Conquest of the Danes and\r\nthe History of King Edward the Confessor were proposed as alternatives\r\nfor this. By the end of the sixteenth century all the cycles of which\r\nmost is known had come to an end. The smaller places—Chelmsford in\r\n1574, Braintree in 1579, Bungay in 1591—had sold off their stock of\r\nplaying-garments. For such dramatic entertainment as the provinces were\r\nstill to get, they must look to travelling companies taking their summer\r\nvacation from the metropolis. Miracle-plays during the seventeenth\r\ncentury were a mere survival. They lingered in distant Cornwall and at\r\nKendal in the hill country of the north; and had been replaced by morals,\r\nthemselves almost equally obsolete, at Manningtree. The last religious\r\nplay recorded in England is a quite exceptional one, given at the end of\r\nJames I’s reign before Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, and an audience\r\nwhich numbered thousands at Ely Place in Holborn.\r\n\r\nIn giving some account of the distribution of the various types of\r\nreligious play throughout England during the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, I am dispensed from any obligation to be exhaustive by the\r\nfact that the greater municipal dramas at least have already been the\r\nsubject of more than one fairly adequate discussion. All I shall attempt\r\nwill be a brief general summary of the main points which emerge from the\r\nmore or less detailed local notices collected in a lengthy appendix.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic English type of play was the long cycle given\r\nannually under the superintendence of the corporation or governing\r\nbody of an important city and divided into a number of distinct scenes\r\nor ‘pageants,’ each of which was the special charge of one or more of\r\nthe local ‘crafts,’ ‘arts,’ or ‘occupations.’ Such cycles, organized\r\nupon very similar lines, can be studied in the records available from\r\nChester, York, Beverley, Coventry, Newcastle, Lincoln, and Norwich;\r\nand the same general model is known or conjectured—sometimes, it is\r\ntrue, on the slightest indication—to have been followed in the plays\r\nof Lancaster, Preston, Kendal, Wakefield, Leicester, Worcester, Louth,\r\nBungay, Canterbury, Dublin, and Aberdeen. As in all matters of municipal\r\ncustom, the relative functions of the corporations and the crafts were\r\nnicely adjusted. The direction and control of the plays as a whole were\r\nin the hands of the corporations. They decided annually whether the\r\nperformance should be given, or whether, for war, pestilence, or other\r\nreason, it should be withheld. They sent round their officers to read the\r\nproclamation or ‘banns’ of the play. They kept an official version of\r\nthe text, at Chester an ‘original,’ at York a ‘register’ copied from the\r\n‘originals’ belonging to the crafts. Agreements and disputes as to the\r\nliability of this or that craft to maintain or contribute to a particular\r\npageant were entered or determined before them. They maintained order\r\nat the time of the play and inflicted fines on the turbulent, or upon\r\ncrafts neglectful or unskilful in carrying out their responsibilities.\r\nIn particular they required the provision of properly qualified actors.\r\nThus Robert Greene and others were admonished before the leet of Coventry\r\nin 1440, that they should play _bene et sufficienter_ so as not to cause\r\na hindrance in any _iocus_. Similarly, Henry Cowper, ‘webster,’ was\r\nfined by the wardens of Beverley in 1452, _quod nesciebat ludum suum_.\r\nAn order at York, in 1476, directed the choice of a body of ‘connyng,\r\ndiscrete, and able players’ to test the quality of all those selected\r\nas actors. All ‘insufficiant personnes, either in connyng, voice or\r\npersonne’ they were to ‘discharge, ammove, and avoide’; and no one was to\r\nperform more than twice in the course of the day. Sometimes the actual\r\noversight of the plays was delegated to specially appointed officers.\r\nAt Beverley the wardens themselves ‘governed’ the Corpus Christi plays,\r\nbut the Paternoster play was in the hands of ‘aldermen of the pageants.’\r\nAt Aberdeen the Haliblude play was undertaken in 1440 by the local lord\r\nof misrule, known as the Abbot of Bon Accord; for the Candlemas play\r\n‘bailyes’ represented the corporation. At Lincoln the ‘graceman’ of\r\nthe guild of St. Anne was responsible, and had the aid of the mayor. At\r\nLeicester a number of ‘overseers’ with two ‘bedalls’ were chosen to have\r\nthe ‘gydyng and rule’ of the play.\r\n\r\nThe corporations do not appear to have themselves incurred much\r\nexpenditure over the performances. They provided sitting-room and\r\nrefreshments for their own members, and for distinguished guests.\r\nRichard II was elaborately entertained with a special _pagina_ when he\r\nvisited York on Corpus Christi day, 1397. Sixty years later a collation,\r\nincluding ‘ij cofyns of counfetys and a pot of grene gynger,’ was\r\nmade ready for Queen Margaret on her visit to Coventry. At York and\r\nBeverley, but not at Coventry, the corporations paid the minstrels, and\r\noccasionally made a special contribution to the funds of a particularly\r\npoor pageant. At York the corporation could well afford to do this, for\r\nthey claimed the right to fix certain ‘stations’ at which, as well as at\r\ntwo or three traditional ones, the plays should be given, and they made\r\na considerable annual profit out of payments by well-to-do citizens who\r\naspired to have one of these at their doors. The stations were marked by\r\nbanners broidered with the arms of the city. At Leicester the ‘playyng\r\ngermands’ seem to have belonged to the corporation. At Beverley in 1391\r\nthey owned all the ‘necessaries,’ pageant garments and properties, of\r\nthe play of Paradise, and lent the same upon security to the craft\r\ncharged therewith. The pageants may also have been originally corporation\r\nproperty in York, for it was stipulated in 1422 that one of them, like\r\nthe banners at the stations, should bear the arms of the city, to the\r\nexclusion of those of the craft.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the cost of the plays fell almost wholly upon the crafts.\r\nThe ordinances of the craft-guilds provide for their maintenance as a\r\n_leitourgia_ or fraternal duty, in the same way as they often provide\r\nfor a ‘serge’ or light to be burnt in some chapel or carried in the\r\nCorpus Christi procession, or, at Beverley, for the _castellum_ in which\r\nthe craft sat to do honour to the procession of St. John of Beverley\r\nin Rogation week. At Coventry, where the burden upon the crafts was\r\nperhaps heaviest, they were responsible for the provision, repairing,\r\nornamenting, cleaning, and strewing with rushes of the pageant, for\r\nthe ‘ferme’ or rent of the pageant house, for the payment of actors,\r\nminstrels, and prompter, for the revision of play-book and songs and the\r\ncopying of parts, for the ‘drawing’ or ‘horsing’ of the pageant on the\r\nday of the performance, for costumes and properties, and above all for\r\ncopious refreshments before and after the play, at the stations, and\r\nduring the preliminary rehearsals. The total cost of the smiths’ pageant\r\nin 1490 was £3 7_s._ 5½_d._ In 1453 they had contracted with one Thomas\r\nColclow to have ‘the rewle of the pajaunt’ for twelve years at an annual\r\npayment of £2 6_s._ 8_d._, and other examples of ‘play lettine’ can be\r\ntraced at Newcastle and elsewhere. But it was more usual for the crafts\r\nto retain the management of the pageants in their own hands; at York\r\neach guild appointed its ‘pageant-masters’ for this purpose. The expense\r\nto the craft primarily in charge of a pageant was sometimes lightened\r\nby fixed contributions from one or more minor bodies affiliated to it\r\nfor the purpose. Part of it was probably met from the general funds of\r\nthe craft; the rest was raised by various expedients. A levy, known as\r\n‘pagent pencys’ at Coventry and as ‘pajaunt silver’ at York, was made\r\nupon every member. The amount varied with the numbers of the craft and\r\nthe status of the craftsman. At York it ranged from 1_d._ to 8_d._ At\r\nBeverley the journeymen paid 8_d._ to light, play, and castle, and 6_d._\r\nonly in years when there was no play. At Coventry the ordinary members of\r\nmore than one craft paid 1_s._; others apparently less. To the proceeds\r\nof the levy might be added fines for the breach of craft ordinances,\r\npayments on the taking out of freedom by strangers and the setting up\r\nof shop or indenturing of apprentices by freemen. At York, the mercers\r\nare found granting free admission to a candidate for their fraternity on\r\ncondition of his entering into a favourable contract for the supply of a\r\nnew pageant. At Coventry, in 1517, one William Pisford left a scarlet and\r\na crimson gown to the tanners for their plays, together with 3_s._ 4_d._\r\nto every craft charged with the maintenance of a pageant. Besides the\r\nlevy, certain personal services were binding upon the craftsmen. They had\r\nto attend upon the play, to do it honour; the Coventry cappers expected\r\ntheir journeymen to do the ‘horsing’ of the pageant.\r\n\r\nIn some cities, the crafts received help from outside. At Coventry,\r\nin 1501, the tilers’ pageant got a contribution of 5_s._ from the\r\nneighbouring tilers of Stoke. At Chester, vestments were borrowed\r\nfrom the clergy; at Lincoln from the priory and the local gentry. A\r\n‘gathering’ was also made in the surrounding districts. The only trace\r\nof any charge made to the spectators, other than the fees for ‘stations’\r\nat York, is at Leicester, where, in 1477, the players paid over to the\r\n‘pachents’ certain sums they had received for playing.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the crafts in a big city were, of course, already formed\r\ninto guilds for ordinary trade purposes, and in their case the necessary\r\norganization for the plays was to hand. But no citizen could wholly\r\nescape his responsibility in so important a civic matter. At Coventry it\r\nwas ordered in 1494 that every person exercising any craft must become\r\ncontributory to some pageant or other. At York the innholders, who do\r\nnot appear to have been a regular guild, were organized in 1483 for the\r\npurposes of a pageant on the basis of a yearly contribution of 4_d._\r\nfrom each man. The demand at Beverley in 1411 for the appropriation of\r\na play to the _generosi_ has already been alluded to. In a Beverley\r\nlist of 1520 the ‘Gentylmen’ are put down for the ‘Castle of Emaut.’\r\nIt may be suspected that some of the other crafts named in the same\r\nlist, such as the ‘Husbandmen’ and the ‘Labourers,’ were not regular\r\nguilds; not to speak of the ‘Prestes,’ who played the ‘Coronacion of\r\nOur Lady.’ This participation of religious bodies in the craft plays\r\ncan be paralleled from other towns. At York the hospital of St. Leonard\r\ntook the Purification in 1415; at Lincoln the cathedral clergy, like the\r\npriests at Beverley, were responsible for the Coronation or Assumption\r\nof the Virgin, a play which at Chester was given by the ‘worshipfull\r\nwyves of this town,’ and at York by the innholders. Both at York\r\nand Chester this scene was dropped at the Reformation. Possibly its\r\nsomewhat exceptional position may be accounted for by its having been\r\na comparatively late addition in all four cycles. Some endeavour after\r\ndramatic appropriateness is visible in the apportioning of the other\r\nplays amongst the crafts. Thus Noah is given to the shipwrights (York,\r\nNewcastle), the watermen (Beverley, Chester), the fishers and mariners\r\n(York); the _Magi_ to the goldsmiths (Beverley, Newcastle, York); the\r\nDisputation in the Temple to the scriveners (Beverley); the Last Supper\r\nto the bakers (Beverley, Chester, York); the Harrowing of Hell to the\r\ncooks (Beverley, Chester).\r\n\r\nA somewhat anomalous position is occupied amongst towns in which the\r\nplays were in the hands of the crafts by Lincoln. Here the task of\r\nsupervision was shared with the corporation by a special guild, religious\r\nand social rather than industrial in character[369], of St. Anne. Perhaps\r\nthis guild had at one time been solely responsible for the plays, and\r\nthere had been a crisis such as took place at Norwich in 1527. Before\r\nthat date the charge of the plays had been borne, fittingly enough, by\r\nthe guild of St. Luke, composed of painters and metalworkers. But in 1527\r\nthis guild was ‘almost fully decayed,’ and upon the representation of\r\nits members the corporation agreed that in future the pageants should be\r\ndistributed amongst the various crafts as was customary elsewhere. The\r\nLincoln plays were on St. Anne’s day, but one does not find a position\r\ncomparable to that of the St. Anne’s guild held by Corpus Christi guilds\r\nin other towns. As a rule such guilds concerned themselves with the\r\nCorpus Christi procession, but not with the plays. At Ipswich, indeed,\r\nthe Corpus Christi guild had the whole conduct of the plays, and the\r\ncraft-guilds as such were not called upon; but this Ipswich guild arose\r\nout of a reorganization of the old merchant-guild, included all the\r\nburgesses, and was practically identical with the corporation. Other\r\ntowns, in which the corporation managed the plays itself, without the\r\nintervention of the craft-guilds, are Shrewsbury, New Romney, and Lydd.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where neither the corporation nor the crafts undertook\r\nplays, it was no uncommon thing for a guild of the religious or social\r\ntype to step into the breach. A series of London plays recorded in 1384,\r\n1391, 1409, and 1411 may all be not unreasonably ascribed to a guild\r\nof St. Nicholas, composed of the ‘parish clerks’ attached to the many\r\nchurches of the city. At a later date the performances of this guild\r\nseem to have become annual and they are traceable, with no very great\r\ncertainty, to the beginning of the sixteenth century. They were cyclical\r\nin character, but not processional, and took place hard by the well known\r\nindifferently as Skinners’ well or Clerkenwell, amongst the orchards\r\nto the north of London. Chaucer says of his ‘parish clerk,’ the ‘joly\r\nAbsolon,’ that\r\n\r\n  ‘Somtyme, to shewe his lightnesse and maistrye,\r\n  He pleyeth Heródës, on a scaffold hye[370].’\r\n\r\nThese London plays may have had some original connexion with the great\r\nfair of the neighbouring priory of St. Bartholomew upon August 24; but\r\nthey are recorded at various dates during the summer, and extended over\r\nfour, five, or even seven days. Whether the guild of St. Nicholas bore\r\nany relation to the clerks of St. Paul’s, who petitioned Richard II in\r\n1378 against the rivalry of certain ‘unexpert people’ in the production\r\nof an Old Testament play, must be matter for conjecture. The performance\r\ncontemplated at St. Paul’s was to be at Christmas. The Cambridge guild\r\nof Corpus Christi was responsible for a _ludus Filiorum Israelis_ about\r\n1350, and this is more likely to have formed part of a cycle than to\r\nhave stood alone. An unverified extract of Warton’s from a Michael-House\r\n_computus_ suggests that some of the Cambridge colleges may have assisted\r\nin dramatic undertakings. At Abingdon the hospital of Christ held their\r\nfeast on Holy Cross day (May 3), 1445, ‘with pageantes and playes, and\r\nMay games.’ At Sleaford, in 1480, a play of the Ascension was performed\r\nby the guild of the Holy Trinity. At Wymondham a guild seems to have\r\nexisted in the sixteenth century for the express purpose of holding a\r\n‘watch and play’ at Midsummer. The proceedings were directed by officers\r\ndesignated ‘husbands.’ The one example of an isolated play under the\r\nmanagement of a craft-guild is at Hull. Here an annual play of Noah,\r\nwith a ship or ark which went in procession, was in the hands of the\r\nTrinity House, a guild of master mariners and pilots. The records extend\r\nfrom 1421 to 1529. There is no sign of a dramatic cycle at Hull. The\r\nNoah play was given on Plough Monday, and it is possible that one may\r\ntrace here a dramatized version of just such a ship procession as may be\r\nfound elsewhere upon the coasts in spring[371]. After the performance\r\nthe ‘ship’ was hung up in the church. The text of the play was perhaps\r\nborrowed from that of the watermen of the neighbouring city of Beverley.\r\n\r\nWhere there were craft-plays, social and religious guilds sometimes\r\ngave supplementary performances. The ‘schaft’ or parochial guild of St.\r\nDunstan’s, Canterbury, owned a play of Abraham and Isaac in 1491. This\r\nmay have been merely a contribution towards the craft-cycle on Corpus\r\nChristi day. On the other hand, the play of St. George, contemplated\r\nby the guild of that saint at New Romney in 1490, was probably an\r\nindependent undertaking. The town play here was a Passion play. At\r\nYork there were two rivals to the Corpus Christi plays. One was the\r\n_Paternoster_ play, for the production of which a guild of the Lord’s\r\nPrayer was in existence at least as early as 1378. By 1488 this guild\r\nwas absorbed into the Holy Trinity guild of the mercers, and in the year\r\nnamed the play was given, apparently at the charges of the mercers,\r\ninstead of the ordinary cycle. All the crafts contributed to similar\r\nperformances in 1558 and 1572. But by this time the supervision, under\r\nthe corporation, of the play had passed to one of the few religious\r\nguilds in York which had escaped suppression, that of St. Anthony. The\r\nother extraordinary York play was a Creed play, bequeathed to the guild\r\nof Corpus Christi in 1446. This was stationary, and was acted decennially\r\nabout Lammas-tide (August 1) at the common hall. In 1483, it was ‘apon\r\nthe cost of the most onest men of every parish,’ who were, it may be\r\nsupposed, members of the guild. In 1535 the crafts paid for it instead\r\nof their usual cycle. Upon the suppression of the guild, the play-book\r\npassed into the custody of the hospital of St. Thomas.\r\n\r\nIn the same way there are instances in which the clergy, who elsewhere\r\nlent help to the craft-plays, gave independent exhibitions of their own.\r\nAt Chester, before the Reformation, they eked out the Whitsun cycle by a\r\nsupplementary performance on Corpus Christi day. The priors of St. John\r\nof Jerusalem, Holy Trinity, and All Saints contributed their share to\r\nthe somewhat incongruous blend of religious and secular entertainments\r\nprovided by the traders of Dublin for the earl of Kildare in 1528. The\r\nso-called _Ludus Coventriae_ has often been supposed to be the play-book\r\nof a cycle acted by the Grey Friars or Franciscans of Coventry. This\r\ntheory hardly survives critical examination. But in 1557, during the\r\nMarian reaction, a Passion play was given at the Grey Friars in London,\r\nand the actors were possibly restored brethren. Miracle-plays must often\r\nhave been performed in choir schools, especially upon their traditional\r\nfeast-days of St. Nicholas, St. Catherine, and the Holy Innocents.\r\nBut there are only two examples, besides that of St. Paul’s in 1378,\r\nactually upon record. In 1430 the _pueri eleemosynae_ of Maxstoke acted\r\non Candlemas day in the hall of Lord Clinton’s castle; and in 1486 those\r\nof St. Swithin’s and Hyde abbeys combined to entertain Henry VII with the\r\nHarrowing of Hell as he sat at dinner in Winchester.\r\n\r\nMany minor plays, both in towns and in country villages, were organized\r\nby the clergy and other officials of parish churches, and are mentioned\r\nin the account books of churchwardens. At London, Kingston, Oxford,\r\nReading, Salisbury, Bath, Tewkesbury, Leicester, Bungay, and Yarmouth,\r\nsuch parochial plays can be traced, sometimes side by side with those\r\nprovided by craft or other guilds. The parochial organization was the\r\nnatural one for the smaller places, where the parish church had remained\r\nthe centre of the popular life[372]. The _actiones_ in the chapelries\r\nof Shipton in Oxfordshire during the thirteenth century may have been\r\nplays of this type. The municipal records of Lydd and New Romney mention\r\nvisits of players to the towns between 1399 and 1508 from no less than\r\nfourteen neighbouring places in Kent and Sussex, many of which must\r\nhave been then, as they are now, quite insignificant. They are Hythe,\r\nWittersham, Herne, Ruckinge, Folkestone, Appledore, Chart, Rye, Wye,\r\nBrookland, Halden, Bethersden, Ham, and Stone. A few other village plays\r\nare to be traced in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century they\r\nare fairly numerous, especially in the eastern counties. In Essex they\r\nare found at Chelmsford, Braintree, Halstead, Heybridge, Malden, Saffron\r\nWalden, Billericay, Starford, Baddow (by ‘children’), Little Baddow,\r\nSabsford, Boreham, Lanchire, Witham, Brentwood, Nayland, Burnham, High\r\nEaster, Writtle, Woodham Walter, and Hanningfield; in Cambridgeshire\r\nat Bassingbourne; in Lincolnshire at Holbeach; in Norfolk at Harling,\r\nLopham, Garboldisham, Shelfhanger, and Kenninghall; in Suffolk at\r\nBoxford, Lavenham, and Mildenhall; in Leicestershire at Foston; in\r\nSomersetshire at Morebath; and in Kent once more at Bethersden. The\r\nlatest instance is a ‘Kynge play’ at Hascombe in Surrey in 1579.\r\n\r\nParochial plays, whether in town or country, appear to have been in\r\nmost cases occasional, rather than annual. Sometimes, as at Kingston\r\nand Braintree, they became a means of raising money for the church, and\r\neven where this object is not apparent, the expenses were lightened in\r\nvarious ways at the cost of neighbouring villages. ‘Banns’ were sent\r\nround to announce the play; or the play itself was carried round on tour.\r\nTwenty-seven villages contributed to a play at Bassingbourne in 1511.\r\nThe Chelmsford play of 1562 and 1563 cost about £50, of which a good\r\nproportion was received from the spectators. The play was given at Malden\r\nand Braintree as well as at Chelmsford, and for years afterwards the\r\nletting out of the stock of garments proved a source of revenue to the\r\nparish. This same practice of hiring garments can be traced at Oxford,\r\nLeicester, and elsewhere. The parochial plays were always, so far as can\r\nbe seen, stationary. At Leicester, Braintree, Halstead, and Heybridge\r\nthey were in the church. That of Harling was ‘at the church gate,’ that\r\nof Bassingbourne in a ‘croft’; that of Chelmsford in a ‘pightell.’ At\r\nReading performances in the market-place and in an open piece of ground\r\ncalled (then and now) the ‘Forbury’ are mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere remain a certain number of plays as to the organization of which\r\nnothing definite can be said. Such are the minor plays, on the legends\r\nof saints, recorded by the annalists of London, Coventry, and Lincoln;\r\nthose referred to in the corporation accounts of King’s Lynn, as given by\r\nunspecified players between 1385 and 1462; and those which took place,\r\nas late as the seventeenth century, in ‘rounds’ or amphitheatres at St.\r\nJust, Perranzabulo, and elsewhere in Cornwall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nGUILD PLAYS AND PARISH PLAYS (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter occupied itself mainly with the diffusion of the\r\nvernacular religious plays in England, with their organization, and with\r\ntheir part in municipal and village life. That study must be completed\r\nby at least the outline of another, dealing with the content and nature\r\nof the performances themselves. Here again it is variety rather than\r\nuniformity which requires attention; for the records and texts of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries bear witness to the effective survival\r\nof all the diverse types of play, to which the evolution of the dramatic\r\ninstinct gave birth in its progress from liturgical office to cosmic\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\nThe term of the evolution—the cosmic cycle itself—is represented by\r\nfive complete texts, and one fragment sufficiently substantial to be\r\nranked with these. There are the plays of the York and Chester crafts.\r\nThe manuscript of the former dates from the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury; those of the latter from the end of the sixteenth and beginning\r\nof the seventeenth: but in both cases it may be assumed that we possess\r\nthe plays, with certain modifications, additions, and omissions, as\r\nthey were given in the palmy days of their history. There are also, in\r\na fifteenth-century manuscript, the so-called ‘Towneley’ plays, as to\r\nwhose origin the most likely theory is that they are the craft-plays\r\nof Wakefield. There is the _Ludus Coventriae_, also of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, which has probably nothing to do with Coventry, but is either,\r\nas scholars generally hold, the text of a strolling company, or, as\r\nseems to me more probable, that of a stationary play at some town in the\r\nEast Midlands not yet identified. If I am right, the _Ludus Coventriae_\r\noccupies a midway position between the three northern craft cycles,\r\nwhich are all processional plays, split up into a number of distinct\r\npageants, and the fifth text, which is Cornish. This is probably of the\r\nfourteenth century, although extant in a fifteenth-century manuscript,\r\nand doubtless represents a stationary performance in one of the ‘rounds’\r\nstill to be seen about Cornwall. The fragment, also Cornish, is not a\r\nwholly independent play, but a sixteenth-century expansion of part of the\r\nearlier text.\r\n\r\nA study of the table of incidents printed in an appendix will show the\r\ngeneral scope of the cyclical plays[373]. My comments thereon must be\r\nfew and brief. The four northerly cycles have a kernel of common matter,\r\nwhich corresponds very closely with just that dramatic stuff which was\r\nhandled in the liturgical and the earliest vernacular dramas. It includes\r\nthe Fall of Lucifer, the Creation, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel; then the\r\nAnnunciation and the group of scenes, from the _Pastores_ to the Massacre\r\nof the Innocents, which went to make up the _Stella_; then the Passion\r\nin the narrower sense, centring in the _planctus Mariae_ and extending\r\nfrom the Conspiracy of the Jews to the Descent from the Cross; then the\r\nResurrection scenes, centring in the _Quem quaeritis_ and ending with the\r\n_Peregrini_ and Incredulity of Thomas; then the Ascension, the Pentecost,\r\nand finally the _Iudicium_ or Doomsday. Almost equally invariable is\r\nsomething in the way of a _Prophetae_. But at York this is thrown into\r\nnarrative instead of dramatic form; and at Chester the typical defile\r\nof prophets, each with his harangue, is deferred to almost the close of\r\nthe cycle (Play xxiii), and in its usual place stand two independent\r\nepisodes of Balaam and of Octavian and the Sibyl. Two other groups of\r\nscenes exhibit a larger measure of diversity between the four cycles. One\r\nis that drawn from the history of the Old Testament Fathers, out of which\r\nthe Deluge and the Sacrifice of Isaac are the only incidents adopted\r\nby all four. The other is the series taken from the missionary life of\r\nChrist, where the only common scenes are the Raising of Lazarus and the\r\nFeast in the House of Simon the Leper, both of which can be traced back\r\nto the liturgical drama[374].\r\n\r\nThe principal source of the plays belonging to this common kernel is,\r\nof course, the biblical narrative, which is followed, so far as it\r\ngoes, with considerable fidelity, the most remarkable divergence being\r\nthat of the _Ludus Coventriae_, which merges the Last Supper with the\r\nscene in the House of Simon. But certain embroideries upon scripture,\r\nwhich found their way into the religious drama at an early stage of its\r\nevolution, are preserved and further elaborated. Thus each of the four\r\ncycles has its Harrowing of Hell, which links the later scenes with the\r\nearlier by introducing, as well as the devils, such personages as Adam\r\nand Eve, Enoch and Elijah, John the Baptist and others[375]. Similarly\r\nthe Suspicion of Joseph and the _obstetrices_ at the Virgin Birth finds\r\na place in all four[376], as does the Healing of Longinus, the blind\r\nknight, by the blood-drops from the cross[377]. Other apocryphal or\r\nlegendary elements are confined to one or more of the cycles[378].\r\nThe Chester plays, for example, have a marked development of the\r\neschatological scenes. Not only is the _Iudicium_ itself extremely long\r\nand elaborate, but it is preceded by two distinct plays, one a section\r\nof the split-up _Prophetae_ ending with the Fifteen Signs, the other an\r\nAntichrist, in which, as in the Tegernsee _Antichristus_[379], Enoch\r\nand Elijah appear as disputants. The most legendary of the northerly\r\ncycles is without doubt the _Ludus Coventriae_. It has the legend of\r\nVeronica, which is only hinted at in the corresponding York play. And\r\nit has so long a series of scenes drawn from the legends of the Virgin\r\nas to make it probable that, like the Lincoln plays and another East\r\nMidland cycle of which a fragment is extant, it was performed not on\r\nCorpus Christi day but on that of St. Anne. Before the Annunciation it\r\ninserts the episodes of Joachim and Anne, Mary in the Temple, and the\r\nBetrothal of Mary. To the common episode of the Suspicion of Joseph\r\nit adds the Purgation of Mary. In the Resurrection scene is a purely\r\nlegendary Apparition of Christ to the Virgin; while the Death, Burial,\r\nAssumption, and Coronation of Mary intervene between the Pentecost and\r\nthe _Iudicium_. This matter from the after-history of the Virgin belongs\r\nalso to the York plays, which add the Apparition to St. Thomas of India.\r\n\r\nThe Cornish plays, although in many respects they are parallel to those\r\nof the north, have yet some very marked features of their own. They have\r\nepisodes of the miraculous Release of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea\r\nfrom Prison, and of the Death of Pilate and the Interview of Veronica\r\nwith Tiberius[380]. But their most remarkable legendary addition is an\r\nelaborate treatment of the history of the Holy Rood, which provides\r\nthe motives for the scenes dealing with Seth, Moses, David, Solomon,\r\nMaximilla, and the Bridge upon Cedron[381]. On the other hand the\r\nCornish plays close with the Ascension and entirely omit the sub-cycle\r\nof the Nativity, passing direct, but for the Holy Rood matter, from the\r\nSacrifice of Isaac to the Temptation.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the majority of the Corpus Christi and other\r\ngreater English plays reached the dimensions of a cosmic cycle. But\r\nin only a few cases is any definite evidence on the point available.\r\nComplete lists are preserved from Beverley and Norwich. The Beverley\r\nseries seems to have been much on the scale of the four extant cycles.\r\nIt extended in thirty-six pageants from the Fall of Lucifer to Doomsday.\r\nLike the Cornish cycle, it included the episode of Adam and Seth; and\r\nit presented an exceptional feature in the insertion of a play of the\r\nChildren of Israel after the Flight into Egypt. The Norwich cycle, which\r\nbegan with the Creation and ended with Pentecost, was a short one of\r\ntwelve pageants[382]. The small number is due, partly to the grouping of\r\nseveral episodes in a single play, partly to the omission of the Passion\r\nproper. The Resurrection followed immediately upon the Baptism. Of other\r\nplays, the chroniclers record that in 1391 the London performance covered\r\nboth the Old and New Testament, that in 1409 it went from the Creation\r\nto the Day of Judgement, and that in 1411 it was ‘from the begynnyng of\r\nthe worlde.’ The fragmentary indications of the records preserved show\r\nthat the Chelmsford play stretched at least from the Creation to the\r\nCrucifixion, the Newcastle play at least from the Creation to the Burial\r\nof the Virgin[383], the Lincoln play at least from the Deluge to the\r\nCoronation of the Virgin. On the other hand the range of the Coventry\r\nplays can only be shown to have been from the Annunciation to Doomsday,\r\nalthough it may be by a mere accident that no Old Testament scenes are\r\nhere to be identified[384].\r\n\r\nExamples, though unfortunately no full texts, can also be traced of the\r\nseparate Nativity and Easter cycles, the merging of which was the most\r\nimportant step in the formation of the complete Corpus Christi play.\r\nBoth, if I read the evidence aright, existed at Aberdeen. There was a\r\n‘Haliblude’ play on Corpus Christi day, which I conceive to have been\r\nessentially a Passion and Resurrection, and a play at Candlemas, which\r\nseems to have included, as well as the Purification, a _Stella_, a\r\nPresentation in the Temple, and something in the way of a _Prophetae_.\r\nThere were performances of Passions in Reading in 1508, in Dublin in\r\n1528, at Shrewsbury in 1567, and in London in 1557 and as late as between\r\n1613 and 1622. I do not suppose that in any of these cases ‘Passion’\r\nexcludes ‘Resurrection.’ The New Romney town play, also, seems to have\r\nbeen a Passion in the wider sense. The records of Easter plays at Bath\r\n(1482), Leicester (1504-7), Morebath (1520-74), Reading (1507, 1533-5),\r\nand Kingston (1513-65), are too slight to bear much comment. They may\r\nrelate to almost anything from a mere Latin _Quem quaeritis_ to a full\r\nvernacular Passion and Resurrection.\r\n\r\nOne interesting text falls to be considered at this point. This is a\r\nfifteenth-century Burial and Resurrection of northern _provenance_. It\r\nis very lyrical in character, and apparently the author set out to write\r\na ‘treyte’ to be read, and shortly after the beginning changed his mind\r\nand made a play of it. There are two scenes. The first is an elaborate\r\n_planctus_, ‘to be playede on gud-friday after-none.’ The second,\r\nintended for ‘Esterday after the resurrectione, In the morowe’ is a _Quem\r\nquaeritis_. An Ascension play was performed by the Holy Trinity guild at\r\nSleaford in 1480. A ‘Christmasse play’ is recorded at Tintinhull in 1451.\r\nHow much it included can hardly be guessed. But the _Stella_ maintained\r\nits independent position, and is found at Yarmouth (1462-1512), Reading\r\n(1499, 1539), Leicester (1547), Canterbury (1503), Holbeach (1548), and\r\nHascombe (1579)[385].\r\n\r\nThe plays just enumerated may be regarded as of precyclical types.\r\nBut there are a few others which, although they occur independently,\r\nwould have their more natural position in cycles of less or greater\r\nrange. In some of these cases it is probable that the independence is\r\nonly apparent, a mere matter of incomplete evidence. There are two\r\nfifteenth-century plays, both on the subject of Abraham and Isaac,\r\none of which is preserved in the ‘Book of Brome’ from Suffolk, the\r\nother in a manuscript now at Dublin, but probably of South Midland\r\n_provenance_. It is of course not impossible that these represent\r\nisolated performances, but it is on the whole more likely that they are\r\nfragments of lost cycles. A third play, of Midland origin, preserved in\r\nthe Digby manuscript, occupies an exceptional position. It deals with\r\nthe Massacre of the Innocents and the Purification, and allusions in a\r\nprologue and epilogue make it clear that it belonged to a cycle in which\r\nit was preceded by a _Pastores_ and a _Magi_, and followed by a Christ\r\nin the Temple. This cycle, however, was not played all at once, but a\r\nportion was given year by year on St. Anne’s day. One of the groups of\r\nplays brought together in the _Ludus Coventriae_ was evidently intended\r\nfor performance under similar conditions. It is probable that the _ludus\r\nFiliorum Israelis_ of the Cambridge Corpus Christi guild about 1350,\r\nthe Abraham and Isaac of the ‘schaft’ of St. Dunstan’s, Canterbury,\r\nbetween 1491 and 1520, and the Adam and Eve (1507) and ‘Cayme’s pageaunt’\r\n(1512-5) of St. Lawrence’s, Reading, formed parts of Corpus Christi\r\ncycles given in those towns.\r\n\r\nIsolated performances of plays picked out of a cycle, or upon subjects\r\nusually treated in a cycle, are, however, not unknown. One or more of\r\nthe Chester plays occasionally formed part of the civic entertainment of\r\na royal or noble personage. When Henry VII visited Winchester in 1486,\r\nthe schoolboys of the two great abbeys of Hyde and St. Swithin’s gave a\r\n_Christi Descensus ad Inferos_ before him at dinner. At York the acting\r\nof an ‘interlude of St. Thomas the Apostle’ on a St. Bartholomew’s eve\r\ntowards the end of the reign of Henry VIII became the occasion for a\r\npapist demonstration. This might have been either the Incredulity of\r\nThomas (Play xlii) or the Apparition of the Virgin to St. Thomas in\r\nIndia (Play xlvi) from the Corpus Christi cycle. At York, also, there\r\nwas, in the hands of a Corpus Christi guild, a distinct play, frequently\r\nperformed between 1446 and the Reformation, called the Creed play. This\r\nwas apparently an expansion of a motive found in the Pentecost scene at\r\nChester and probably at Coventry, but not at York itself, wherein, after\r\nthe coming of the Holy Ghost, each of the apostles in turn enunciates\r\none of the articles of the so-called Apostles’ creed. At Hull, where I\r\nfind no trace of a cycle, the Trinity guild of sea-faring men had their\r\nplay of Noah. At Lincoln, a play of Tobit, which does not actually, so\r\nfar as I know, form part of the Old Testament section of any English\r\ncycle[386], was substituted for the regular Corpus Christi play after\r\nthe Reformation. Naturally such exceptional performances became more\r\ncommon in the decadence of the religious drama[387]. Thus the very\r\nscratch series of plays shown before the earl of Kildare at Dublin, in\r\nthe Christmas of 1528, included, besides other contributions both sacred\r\nand secular, an Adam and Eve by the tailors and a Joseph and Mary by the\r\ncarpenters. The choice of these subjects was evidently motived by their\r\nappropriateness to the craft representing them. Similarly, when John Bale\r\nwas bishop of Ossory in 1553, he had performed at the market-cross of\r\nKilkenny, on the day of the proclamation of Queen Mary, a short fragment\r\nof a cycle consisting of a _Prophetae_, a Baptism, and a Temptation. One\r\nfancies that this strange protagonist of the Reformation must have had\r\nin his mind some quaint verbal analogy between ‘John Bale’ and ‘John\r\nBaptist,’ for he states that he also wrote a dramatic _Vita D. Ioannis\r\nBaptistae_ in fourteen books. Nor is this the only example of the\r\ntreatment of a subject, merely episodic in the Corpus Christi cycles, in\r\na distinct and elaborate play. The invaluable Digby manuscript contains\r\na similar expansion, from the East or West Midlands, of the story of\r\nMary Magdalen. It follows the narrative of the _Golden Legend_, and\r\nintroduces the familiar scenes of the Raising of Lazarus, the Feast in\r\nthe House of Simon the Leper, the _Quem quaeritis_, and the _Hortulanus_,\r\npreceding these with episodes of the life of the Magdalen _in gaudio_,\r\nand following them with the Conversion of the King and Queen of\r\nMarseilles, and of Mary’s Life in the Wilderness and Death. As offshoots\r\nfrom the Corpus Christi cycle may also be regarded the Deaths of the\r\nApostles played in the Dublin series of 1528, Thomas Ashton’s _Julian\r\nthe Apostate_ at Shrewsbury in 1565, and the _Destruction of Jerusalem_,\r\nwritten by John Smith in 1584 to take the place of the traditional plays\r\nat Coventry[388].\r\n\r\nThe Mary Magdalen and the rest of the group just described may be\r\nconsidered as standing halfway between the plays of and akin to the\r\nCorpus Christi cycle and those founded on the legends of saints. Of\r\nregular saint-plays there are unfortunately only two texts available\r\nfrom these islands. The Digby manuscript contains an East Midland\r\nConversion of St. Paul, which, however, is almost wholly biblical and\r\nnot legendary. It will be remembered that the subject was one known\r\neven to the liturgical drama[389]. There is also a Cornish play of St.\r\nMeriasek or Mereadocus, the patron saint of Camborne, written at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century. Other such plays are, however, upon\r\nrecord. It is perhaps curious that no mention should be found of any\r\nEnglish parallel to either the Saint Nicholas plays or the _Miracles de\r\nNostre Dame_ of France. It can hardly be doubted that the former at least\r\nexisted in connexion with the widespread revel of the Boy Bishop[390].\r\nThe most popular English saint for dramatic purposes appears to have\r\nbeen St. George. A play of St. George was maintained by the town of\r\nLydd, and was probably copied by a neighbouring guild at New Romney.\r\nAnother, on an elaborate scale, was given by a group of villages at\r\nBassingbourne in 1511. These seem to have been genuine dramas, and not\r\nmere ‘ridings’ or folk-plays such as occur elsewhere[391]. A St. George\r\nplay, described by Collier at Windsor in 1416, can be resolved into a\r\ncake. St. Thomas of Canterbury was only honoured with a dumb show in his\r\nown city, but there was a play upon him at King’s Lynn in 1385. Of quite\r\na number of other saint-plays the barest notices exist. London had hers\r\non St. Catherine; Windsor on St. Clotilda; Coventry on St. Catherine and\r\nSt. Crytyan; Lincoln on St. Laurence, St. Susanna, St. Clara, and St.\r\nJames; Shrewsbury on St. Feliciana and St. Sabina; Bethersden in Kent\r\non St. Christina; Braintree in Essex on St. Swithin, St. Andrew, and\r\nSt. Eustace. The Dublin shoemakers contributed a play on their patron\r\nsaints Crispin and Crispinian to the Dublin festival of 1528. In London,\r\nthe plays on the days of St. Lucy and St. Margaret at St. Margaret’s,\r\nSouthwark, may have been on the stories of those saints; and during the\r\nMarian reaction a ‘goodly’ stage-play was given at St. Olave’s church on\r\nSt. Olave’s day.\r\n\r\nQuite unique, as dealing with a contemporary ‘miracle,’ is the play of\r\nthe Blessed Sacrament, performed at one of the many places bearing the\r\nname of Croxton, in the latter half of the fifteenth century. According\r\nto the manuscript, the event upon which it was based, the marvellous\r\nconversion of a Jew who attempted an outrage upon a host, took place at\r\nHeraclea in Spain, in 1461. There is, curiously enough, a late French\r\nplay, quite independent of the English one, upon an exactly parallel\r\nmiracle assigned to Paris and the thirteenth century[392].\r\n\r\nThe variation in the types of English miracle-plays naturally implies\r\nsome variation also in the manner of representation. The normal craft\r\ncycles of the greater towns were processional in character. They were\r\nnot played throughout by a single body of actors and upon a single\r\nstage; but the action was divided into a number of independent scenes,\r\nto each of which was assigned its own group of performers and its own\r\nsmall movable stage or ‘pageant.’ And each scene was repeated at several\r\n‘stations’ in different parts of the city, pageant succeeding pageant\r\nin regular order, with the general effect of a vast procession slowly\r\nunrolling itself along the streets[393]. This method of playing was\r\nconvenient to the distribution of the _leitourgia_ among the guilds, and\r\nwas adopted in all those places, Chester, York, Beverley, and Coventry,\r\nfrom which our records happen to be the fullest. But it was not the\r\nprimitive method and, as has been pointed out in a previous chapter, it\r\nprobably arose from an attempt about the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury to adapt the already existing miracle-plays to the distinctive\r\nfeature of the festival of Corpus Christi. To this point it will be\r\nnecessary to recur[394]. The processional play was rare outside England,\r\nand even in England it at no period became universal. Two at least of the\r\ngreat cycles that survive, the Cornish one and the _Ludus Coventriae_,\r\nas well as several smaller plays, can be clearly shown from internal\r\nevidence to have been intended for stationary performance. They do not\r\nnaturally cleave asunder into distinct scenes. The same personages\r\nappear and reappear: the same properties and bits of scenery are left\r\nand returned to, often at considerable intervals. Moreover stationary\r\nperformances are frequently implied by the records. At Lincoln, after\r\nthe suppression of the old _visus_ of St. Anne’s processional play,\r\nthe corporation ordered the performance of a ‘standing’ play ‘of some\r\nstory of the Bible.’ At Newcastle, although pageants of the plays went\r\nin the procession, the actual performance seems to have been given in a\r\n‘stead.’ This arrangement is exactly parallel to that of the Florentine\r\n_rappresentazioni_ on St. John’s day in 1454[395]. Elsewhere there\r\nwas commonly enough no ‘pageant’ at all. The ‘standing’ plays may be\r\ntraced at various removes from their original scene, the floor of the\r\nchurch[396]. Indeed, the examples of Braintree in 1523 and 1525, of\r\nHalstead in 1529, of Heybridge in 1532, seem to show that, quite apart\r\nfrom the survival of ritual plays proper, the miracle-play, even at\r\nthe very moment of its extinction, had not been always and everywhere\r\nexcluded from the church itself. The Beverley _repraesentatio dominicae\r\nresurrectionis_ about 1220 had got as far as the churchyard. At Bungay in\r\n1566 they played in the churchyard, and at Harling in 1452 ‘at the cherch\r\ngate.’ The latest of all the village plays, that of Hascombe in 1579,\r\nwas at, but perhaps not in the church. The next step brought the plays\r\nto the market-place, which itself in many towns lay just outside the\r\nchurch door. At Louth the Corpus Christi play was in the ‘markit-stede,’\r\nand so were some at least of the Reading plays. A neighbouring field\r\nmight be convenient; the Bassingbourne play was in a ‘croft,’ that of\r\nChelmsford in a ‘pightell.’ Certain places had a bit of waste ground\r\ntraditionally devoted to the entertainment of the citizens. Such were\r\nthe ‘Forbury’ at Reading and the ‘Quarry’ at Shrewsbury. The Aberdeen\r\nHaliblude play took place _apud ly Wyndmylhill_. Edinburgh constructed\r\nits ‘playfield’ in the Greenside at considerable cost in 1554, while in\r\nCornwall permanent amphitheatres were in use. A writer contemporary with\r\nthe later performances describes these as made of earth in open fields\r\nwith an enclosed ‘playne’ of some fifty feet in diameter. If they are\r\ncorrectly identified with the ‘rounds’ of St. Just and Perranzabulo,\r\nthese examples at least were much larger. The St. Just round is of\r\nstone, with seven tiers of seats, and measures 126 feet in diameter; the\r\nearthen one at Perranzabulo is 130 feet, and has a curious pit in the\r\ncentre, joined to the edge by a trench. The disposition of these rounds\r\nat the time of performance can be studied in the diagrams reproduced from\r\nthe fifteenth-century manuscript of the plays by Mr. Norris. Within a\r\ncircular area is arranged a ring of eight spots which probably represent\r\nstructures elevated above the general surface of the ‘playne.’ They\r\nhave labels assigning them to the principal actors. Thus for the _Origo\r\nMundi_ the labels are _Celum_, _Tortores_, _Infernum_, _Rex Pharao_, _Rex\r\nDauid_, _Rex Sal[omon]_, _Abraham_, _Ortus_. From the stage directions\r\nit would appear that the raised portions were called _pulpita_ or\r\n_tenti_, and by Jordan at a later date ‘rooms’; that the ‘playne’ was the\r\n_platea_; and that the action went on partly on the _pulpita_, partly\r\non the _platea_ between them. Except that it is circular instead of\r\noblong, the scheme corresponds exactly to that of the continental plays\r\nshown in an earlier chapter to have been determined by the conditions of\r\nperformance within a church[397]. Those plays also had their _platea_;\r\nand their _domus_, _loca_, or _sedes_ answer to the _pulpita_ and _tenti_\r\nof Cornwall. Judging by the somewhat scanty indications available, the\r\ndisposition of other English ‘standing’ plays must have been on very\r\nsimilar lines. In some cases there is evidence that the level _platea_\r\nwas replaced by a raised ‘platform,’ ‘scaffold,’ or ‘stage.’ Thus\r\nChaucer’s ‘joly Absolon’ played Herod ‘on a scaffold hye[398].’ But the\r\n‘stages’ or ‘scaffolds’ mentioned in accounts are sometimes merely for\r\nthe spectators and sometimes equivalent to the _loca_ of leading actors.\r\nIn the Digby play of St. Mary Magdalen, a practicable ship moves about\r\nthe _platea_. Possibly a similar bit of realism was used elsewhere for\r\nthe ever popular ‘Noy schippe,’ and, if so, this may explain the pit and\r\ntrench of the Perranzabulo ‘round[399].’\r\n\r\nAs to the ‘pageant’ or movable stage of the processional plays, a good\r\ndeal of information is preserved. Dugdale describes it at Coventry as a\r\n‘Theater ... very large and high, placed upon wheels’; Rogers at Chester\r\nas ‘a highe place made like a howse with ij rowmes, beinge open on yᵉ\r\ntope: the lower rowme they apparelled and dressed them selues; and in\r\nthe higher rowme they played; and they stood vpon 6 (_v.l._ 4) wheeles.’\r\nAccording to an inventory of 1565 the grocers’ pageant at Norwich was\r\n‘a Howse of Waynskott paynted and buylded on a Carte wᵗ fowre whelys.’\r\nIt had a square top or canopy; on it were placed a gilt griffin and two\r\nlarge and eighty-three small vanes; and about it were hung three painted\r\ncloths. Similar adornments of the pageant were in use at Coventry. At\r\nYork it bore the arms of the city or of the guild. M. Jusserand has\r\nunearthed from a Bodleian manuscript two fourteenth-century miniatures\r\nwhich apparently represent pageants. These have draperies covering the\r\nwhole of the lower ‘room’ down to the ground and resemble nothing so\r\nmuch as the ambulant theatre of a Punch and Judy show[400]. The pageants\r\nwere probably arranged so that the action might be visible from every\r\nside. The scenery would therefore be simple—a throne, a house. Certain\r\nplays, however, necessitate a divided scene, such as the inside and\r\noutside of a temple[401]. For the ‘hell,’ the traditional monstrous head\r\non a lower level, with practicable chains and fire, was required[402].\r\nThe pageant used for the Flood scene was doubtless shaped like an ark.\r\nThe ‘shipp’ belonging to the Trinity guild of Hull cost £5 8_s._ 4_d._\r\nThe ordinary pageant may have been less expensive. That of the Doom at\r\nYork was made ‘of newe substanciale’ for seven marks, the old pageant\r\nand a free admission into the guild. At Lincoln three times as much was\r\ncharged for housing the ship as for any other pageant.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the pageant is capable of a very easy explanation[403].\r\nLike the _edifizio_ of the Italian _rappresentazioni_, it is simply\r\nthe raised _locus_, _sedes_, or _domus_ of the stationary play put upon\r\nwheels. Just as the action of the stationary play took place partly on\r\nthe various _sedes_, partly in the _platea_, so Coventry actors come and\r\ngo to and from the pageant in the street. ‘Here Erode ragis in the pagond\r\n& in the strete also,’ says a stage direction. It should be observed that\r\nthe plays at Coventry were exceptionally long, and that scaffolds seem to\r\nhave been attached to the pageant proper in order to get sufficient space.\r\n\r\nThe number of ‘stations’ at which the plays were given varied in the\r\ndifferent towns. At York there were from twelve to sixteen; at Beverley\r\nsix; at Coventry not more than three or four can be identified. The many\r\nscenes and frequent repetitions naturally made the processional plays\r\nvery lengthy affairs. At Chester they were spread over three days; at\r\nYork they were got through in one, but playing began at half-past four\r\nin the morning. At Newcastle, on the other hand, the plays were in the\r\nafternoon. The banns of the _Ludus Coventriae_ promise a performance ‘at\r\nvj of the belle,’ but whether in the morning or evening is not stated.\r\n\r\nThe normal occasion for the greater plays was the feast of Corpus\r\nChristi on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday. A few exceptions are,\r\nhowever, to be noted. At Chester, Norwich, New Romney, and apparently\r\nLeicester, the date chosen was Whitsuntide. Yet at Chester the play is\r\ncalled the ‘Corpus Christi play’ in craft documents of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and even in the municipal ‘White Book’ of the sixteenth; from\r\nwhich it must be inferred either that the term was used of all cyclical\r\nplays without regard to their date, or, more probably, that at Chester\r\na performance originally given on Corpus Christi day had been for some\r\nreason transferred to Whitsuntide. The motive may have been a desire to\r\navoid clashing between the plays and the great Corpus Christi procession\r\nin which the crafts everywhere took a prominent part. A difficulty arose\r\non this score at York in 1426, and a Franciscan preacher, one William\r\nMelton, tried to induce the citizens to have the plays on the day before\r\nCorpus Christi. Ultimately the alternative was adopted of having the\r\nprocession on the day after. At Lincoln the plays were on St. Anne’s\r\nday (July 26) and the last pageant was acted by the clergy in the nave\r\nof the cathedral. At Aberdeen there appear to have been two cycles, a\r\nprocessional Nativity at Candlemas and a Haliblude play on Windmill Hill\r\nat Corpus Christi.\r\n\r\nThe oversight of the actors was, as pointed out in the last chapter, an\r\nimportant element in the civic control of the craft-plays. The mention\r\nat York of a commission of ‘connyng, discrete and able players’ must not\r\nbe taken to imply that these were in any sense professionals. All the\r\nactors received fees, on a scale proportionate to the dignity of their\r\nparts. Thus at Coventry one Fawston got 4_d._ ‘for hangyng Judas,’ and\r\n4_d._ more ‘for coc croyng.’ The payment to the performer of God was\r\n3_s._ 4_d._ A ‘sowle,’ whether ‘savyd’ or ‘dampnyd,’ got 20_d._, and a\r\n‘worme of conscyence’ only 8_d._ At Hull, Noah was generally paid 1_s._,\r\nGod and Noah’s wife a trifle less. But there is nothing to show that the\r\nperformers were drawn from the minstrel class: they were probably, like\r\n‘joly Absolon,’ members of the guilds undertaking the plays. The Chester\r\nmen describe themselves in their banns as not ‘playeres of price’ but\r\n‘Craftes men and meane men.’ The epilogue to the Conversion of St. Paul\r\nin the Digby manuscript similarly deprecates unkindly criticism of folk\r\n‘lackyng lytturall scyens ... that of Retoryk haue non intellygens.’ A\r\ncharacteristic of the acting which greatly impressed the imagination\r\nof the audience seems to have been the rant and bombast put from very\r\nearly times in the mouths of such royal or pseudo-royal personages as\r\nHerod and Pilate.[404] In the Chester plays fragments of French, as\r\nin a liturgical play fragments of gibberish[405], are used to enhance\r\nthis effect. In the Cornish plays, as in the modern music hall, each\r\nperformer at his first appearance displays himself in a preliminary strut\r\nabout the stage. _Hic pompabit Abraham_, or _Moses_, or _David_, say the\r\nstage directions. As is usually the case with amateurs, the function of\r\nthe prompter became an exceedingly important one. If the Cornish writer\r\nRichard Carew may be trusted, the local players did not learn their\r\nparts at all, but simply repeated them aloud after the whispers of the\r\n‘ordinary[406].’ Probably this was exceptional; it certainly was not the\r\npractice at Beverley, where there is a record of an actor being fined\r\n_quod nesciebat ludum suum_. But it may be taken for granted that the\r\n‘beryng of the boke,’ which is so frequently paid for in the accounts,\r\nwas never a sinecure. Another functionary who occasionally appears is the\r\nstage-manager. In the later Cornish plays he is called the ‘conveyour.’\r\nThe great Chelmsford performance of 1562 was superintended by one Burles\r\nwho was paid, with others, for ‘suing’ it, and who probably came from a\r\ndistance, as he and his boy were boarded for three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe professional assistance of the minstrels, although not called in\r\nfor the acting, was welcome for the music. This was a usual and a\r\nconsiderable item in the expenses. At the Chelmsford performance just\r\nmentioned the waits of Bristol and no less than forty other minstrels\r\nwere employed. There is no sign of a musical accompaniment to the\r\ndialogue of the existing plays, which was spoken, and not, like that of\r\ntheir liturgical forerunners, chanted. But the York and Coventry texts\r\ncontain some noted songs, and several plays have invitations to the\r\nminstrels to strike up at the conclusion or between the scenes. Minstrels\r\nare also found accompanying the proclaimers of the banns or preliminary\r\nannouncements of plays. These banns seem to have been versified, like\r\nthe plays themselves. They are often mentioned, and several copies exist.\r\nThose of Chester were proclaimed by the city crier on St. George’s day;\r\nthose of the Croxton play and the _Ludus Coventriae_ were carried round\r\nthe country-side by _vexillatores_ or banner-bearers. Minstrelsy was not\r\nthe only form of lighter solace provided for the spectators of the plays.\r\nTwo of those in the Digby manuscript were accompanied with dances. At\r\nBungay a ‘vyce’ was paid ‘for his pastyme before the plaie, and after\r\nthe plaie.’ There were ‘vices’ too at Chelmsford, and ‘fools,’ by which\r\nis meant the same thing[407], at Heybridge and New Romney. But these\r\nexamples are taken from the decadence of the miracle-play, rather than\r\nfrom its heyday.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the Bassingbourne play in 1511 include a payment to ‘the\r\ngarnement man for garnements and propyrts and playbooks.’ This was an\r\noccasional and not an annual play, and apparently at the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century such plays were sufficiently frequent to render the\r\noccupation of theatrical outfitter a possible one. Certainly those lucky\r\nparishes, such as Chelmsford or St. Peter’s, Oxford, which possessed a\r\nstock of ‘game gear,’ found a profit in letting it out to less favoured\r\nplaces. The guilds responsible for the greater plays naturally preserved\r\ntheir own costumes and properties from year to year, supplementing\r\nthese where necessary by loans from the neighbouring gentry and clergy.\r\nThe Middle Ages were not purists about anachronism, and what was good\r\nenough for an English bishop was good enough for Annas and Caiaphas. The\r\nhands of the craftsmen who acted were discreetly cased in the gloves,\r\nwithout which no ceremonial occasion was complete, and sometimes, at\r\nleast, vizors or masks were worn. But, as a rule, the stage setting\r\nleft a good deal to the imagination. The necessaries for the play of\r\nParadise at Beverley in 1391 consisted of the ‘karre’ or pageant, eight\r\nhasps, eighteen staples, two vizors, a pair of wings for the angel, a\r\nfir-spar (the tree of knowledge), a worm (the serpent), two pairs of\r\nlinen breeches, two pairs of shifts, and one sword. For a similar play\r\nthe Norwich grocers possessed in 1565, besides the pageant and its\r\nfittings, sufficient ‘cotes and hosen’ for all the characters, that\r\nof the serpent being fitted with a tail, a ‘face’ and hair for the\r\nFather, hair for Adam and Eve, and—‘a Rybbe colleryd Red.’ A few other\r\ninteresting details can be gathered from various records. At Canterbury\r\nthe steeds of the _Magi_ were made of hoops and laths and painted canvas.\r\nIn the Doomsday scene at Coventry the ‘savyd’ and ‘dampnyd’ souls were\r\ndistinguished by their white or black colour[408]. The hell mouth was\r\nprovided with fire, a windlass, and a barrel for the earthquake. There\r\nwere also three worlds to be set afire, one, it may be supposed, at\r\neach station. The stage directions to Jordan’s Cornish Creation of the\r\nWorld are full of curious information. The Father appears in a cloud and\r\nwhen he speaks out of heaven, ‘let ye levys open.’ Lucifer goes down to\r\nhell ‘apareled fowle wᵗʰ fyre about hem’ and the plain is filled with\r\n‘every degre of devylls of lether and spirytis on cordis.’ In Paradise a\r\nfountain and ‘fyne flowers’ suddenly spring up, and a little later ‘let\r\nfyshe of dyuers sortis apeare & serten beastis.’ Lucifer becomes ‘a fyne\r\nserpent made wᵗʰ a virgyn face & yolowe heare upon her head.’ Adam and\r\nEve departing from Paradise ‘shewe a spyndell and a dystaff.’ For the\r\nmurder of Abel, according to old tradition, a ‘chawbone’ is needed[409],\r\nand for the ark, timber and tools, including ‘a mallet, a calkyn yren,\r\nropes, masstes, pyche and tarr.’ I have not space to dwell further on\r\nthese archaeological _minutiae_. One point, however, seems to deserve\r\nanother word. Many writers have followed Warton in asserting that Adam\r\nand Eve were represented on the stage in actual nakedness[410]. The\r\nstatement is chiefly based upon a too literal interpretation of the\r\nstage directions of the Chester plays[411]. There is a fine _a priori_\r\nimprobability about it, and as a matter of fact there can be very little\r\ndoubt that the parts were played, as they would have been on any other\r\nstage in any other period of the world’s history, except possibly at the\r\nRoman _Floralia_[412], in fleshings. Jordan is quite explicit. Adam and\r\nEve are to be ‘aparlet in whytt lether,’ and although Jordan’s play is\r\na late one, I think it may be taken for granted that white leather was\r\nsufficient to meet the exigencies even of mediaeval realism.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of miracle-plays frequently contain entries of payments for\r\nproviding copies of the text used. When the stock of the Chelmsford play\r\nwas dispersed in 1574, the copies were valued at £4. Such copies were\r\nnaturally of more than one kind. There was the authoritative text kept\r\nfor reference by the guild or other body of presenters. This is sometimes\r\ncalled the ‘play-book’ or ‘game-book.’ The Cornish term is _ordinale_,\r\na derivative from the _ordo_ of the liturgical drama[413]. That in use\r\nelsewhere is more commonly ‘original,’ which appears in a variety of\r\nquaint spellings[414]. In the great towns where plays were given by the\r\ncrafts under the general supervision of the corporation, each craft held\r\nthe ‘original’ of its own play, but approved transcripts of these were\r\nalso in the hands of the corporation officers. At Chester this transcript\r\nwas itself called the ‘original’; at York it was the _registrum_.\r\nMost of the extant manuscripts of plays appear to be of the nature of\r\n‘originals.’ From York and probably from Wakefield we have _registra_.\r\nThe Chester texts are, however, late transcripts due to the zeal of\r\nlocal antiquaries, perhaps in view of some frustrated revival. Specimens\r\nexist also of two other kinds of copy. There are single plays from both\r\nChester and York which have all the appearance of having been folded up\r\nfor the pocket of a prompter. And the nature of the ‘parts’ prepared\r\nfor individual actors may be seen from the transition example edited by\r\nProfessor Skeat from a manuscript found at Shrewsbury. They contained the\r\nactors’ own speeches, with the ‘cues’ or closing words of the preceding\r\nspeeches which signalled to him that his turn was at hand[415].\r\n\r\nIndications of the authorship of plays are very scanty. John Bale has\r\npreserved a list of his own plays, some at least of which were acted\r\nin mediaeval fashion. It may perhaps be assumed that Nicholas Udall,\r\nafterwards author of _Ralph Roister Doister_, wrote the play performed\r\nat Braintree in 1534, while he was vicar there. At Bassingbourne in 1511\r\none John Hobarde, ‘brotherhood priest,’ was paid ‘for the play-book.’ In\r\nthis and in several of the following cases it is impossible to determine\r\nwhether an author or merely a copying scribe is in question. The\r\ncorporation of Beverley employed Master Thomas Bynham, a friar preacher,\r\nto write ‘banis’ for their plays in 1423. At Reading we find Mr. Laborne\r\n‘reforming’ the Resurrection play about 1533. The later Cornish play of\r\nthe Creation of the World was ‘wryten’ by William Jordan in 1611, and\r\nthat of St. Meriasek by ‘dominus Hadton’ in 1504. At Bungay William Ellys\r\nwas paid in 1558 ‘for the interlude and game-book[416],’ and Stephen\r\nPrewett, a priest at Norwich, for some labour about the matter of a\r\ngame-book in 1526. This same Stephen Prewett had a fee from the Norwich\r\ngrocers ‘for makyng of a new ballet’ in 1534. One of the extant Coventry\r\nplays was ‘nevly correcte’ and the other ‘nevly translate’ by Robert Croo\r\nin 1535. The name ‘Thomas Mawdycke’ and the date 1591 are written at the\r\nhead of some songs belonging to the former. In 1566 Thomas Nycles set a\r\nsong for the drapers. Robert Croo or Crowe seems to have made himself\r\ngenerally useful in connexion with the Coventry plays. In 1563 the smiths\r\npaid him for ‘ij leves of our pley boke.’ In 1557 he wrote the ‘boke’\r\nfor the drapers, and between 1556 and 1562 further assisted them by\r\nplaying God, mending the ‘devell’s cottes,’ and supplying ‘iij worldys’\r\nfor burning and a hat for the Pharisee. A later Coventry playwright was\r\nJohn Smith of St. John’s College, Oxford, who wrote the ‘new play’ of\r\nthe Destruction of Jerusalem in 1584 for a sum of £13 6_s._ 8_d._ The\r\nfifteenth-century Croxton play has the initials ‘R. C.’ One of the plays\r\nin the Digby manuscript ‘Ihon Parfre ded wryte.’ The three others have\r\nthe initials ‘M. B.,’ and against the _Poeta_ of the prologue to one of\r\nthem a later hand has written in the margin ‘Myles Blomfylde.’ I repeat\r\nthe caution that some at least of these names may be those of mere\r\ncopyists. Miles Blomfield has been identified with a monk of Bury of that\r\nname. As he was born in 1525 he obviously was not the original author\r\nof the Digby plays, which are probably of the fifteenth century. A much\r\ngreater monk of Bury, John Lydgate, has been claimed as the author of the\r\n_Ludus Coventriae_, but there does not seem to be any real evidence for\r\nthis[417]. On the other hand I see no reason to doubt the old Chester\r\ntradition which connects the plays of that city with the name of Randulph\r\nHigden, author of the _Polychronicon_. The story is very fairly coherent,\r\nand the date (1328) which it assigns for the plays falls within the\r\nperiod of Higden’s monastic life at St. Werburgh’s abbey.\r\n\r\nIt must, of course, be borne in mind that the notion of authorship\r\nis only imperfectly applicable to the miracle-plays. The task of the\r\nplaywrights was one less of original composition than of adaptation, of\r\nrewriting and rearranging existing texts so as to meet the needs of the\r\nparticular performances in which they were interested. Obviously this was\r\na process that could be carried out with more or with less individuality.\r\nThere were slavish adapters and there were liberal adapters. But on the\r\nwhole the literary problem of the plays lies in tracing the evolution of\r\na form rather than in appreciating individual work. Even when written,\r\nthe plays, if periodically performed, were subject to frequent revision,\r\nmotived partly by the literary instinct for furbishing up, partly by\r\nchanging conditions, such as the existence of a varying number of\r\ncraft-guilds ready to undertake the responsibility for a scene[418].\r\nFurther alterations, on theological rather than literary grounds, were\r\nnaturally called for at the Reformation. Thus Jordan’s Cornish _Creation\r\nof the World_ is clearly based upon the older play printed by Mr.\r\nNorris. The book of the Norwich grocers contains two versions of their\r\nplay of Paradise, the later of which, ‘newely renvid accordynge unto\r\nyᵉ Skrypture,’ was substituted for the earlier in 1565. The Towneley\r\nmanuscript has two alternative versions of the _Pastores_. That of\r\nYork has a fragmentary second version of the Coronation of the Virgin,\r\nand when read with the records affords much evidence of the dropping,\r\ninsertion, and rearrangement of scenes, and of doctrinal revision during\r\nthe sixteenth century. At Coventry the local annals mention ‘new playes’\r\nin 1520, fifteen years before the existing texts were ‘nevly correcte’\r\nand ‘translate’ by Robert Crowe.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the relations in which the plays stand towards one\r\nanother is a field in which literary scholars, delayed by the want of\r\ntrustworthy critical texts, are only just beginning to set foot. The\r\nquestion lies outside the scope of these pages. But I may call attention\r\nto Mr. Pollard’s analysis of the various _strata_ in the Towneley\r\nplays[419], and to the studies by Professor Hohlfeld[420] and Professor\r\nDavidson[421] upon the greater cycles in general and especially upon\r\nthe influence exercised by York over the Towneley and other plays, as\r\nexcellent examples of what may be looked for. The _Ludus Coventriae_\r\nwill afford a good subject for investigation, when the manuscript has\r\nbeen properly re-edited. It is evidently a patchwork cycle, roughly put\r\ntogether and in parts easy to break up into its constituent elements.\r\nThe problem is not confined to English literature. The Chester tradition\r\nrepresents Higden’s work as an affair rather of translation than of\r\nanything else. It is not quite clear whether translation from the Latin\r\nor from the Norman-French is intended. In any case it is probable that\r\nthe earlier English playwrights made use of French models, and certain\r\nparallels have already been traced between English plays and others to\r\nbe found in the French collection known as the _Viel Testament_. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, the international solidarity of mediaeval literature is to be\r\ntaken into account.\r\n\r\nTwo chapters back I defined the change which took place in the character\r\nof the _religious drama_ of western Europe during the thirteenth century\r\nas _being_, to a large extent, _a process of secularization_. ‘Out of\r\nthe hands of the clergy,’ I said, ‘in their naves and choirs, the drama\r\npassed to those of the laity in their market-places and guild-halls.’\r\nAnd I pointed to the natural result of these altered conditions in ‘the\r\nreaction of the temper of the folk upon the handling of the plays, the\r\nbroadening of their human as distinct from their religious aspect[422].’\r\nA study of the texts and records of the fully developed miracle-play as\r\nit existed in these islands from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century\r\ncan only confirm this view. I have indeed shown, I hope, in the course\r\nof this imperfect summary, that the variety of mediaeval theatrical\r\norganization was somewhat greater than a too exclusive attention to\r\nthe craft-cycles of the great towns has always allowed scholars to\r\nrecognize. But, with all qualifications and exceptions, it is none the\r\nless true that what began as a mere spectacle, devised by ecclesiastics\r\nfor the edification of the laity, came in time to appeal to a deep-rooted\r\nnative instinct of drama in the folk and to continue as an essentially\r\npopular thing, a _ludus_ maintained by the people itself for its own\r\ninexhaustible wonder and delight[423]. Literary critics have laid\r\nstress upon the emergence of the rude humour of the folk, with its love\r\nof farce and realism, in somewhat quaint juxtaposition to the general\r\nsubject-matter of the plays. I only desire to add here that the instinct\r\nwhich made the miracle-plays a joy to the mediaeval burgher is the same\r\ninstinct which the more primitive peasant satisfied in a score of modes\r\nof rudimentary folk-drama[424]. The popularity and elaboration of the\r\ndevil scenes in the plays is the most striking manifestation of this\r\nidentity[425]. For your horned and blackened devil is the same personage,\r\nwith the same vague tradition of the ancient heathen festival about him,\r\nwhether he riots it through the cathedral aisles in the Feast of Fools,\r\nor hales the Fathers to limbo and harries the forward spectators in the\r\nmarket-place of Beverley or Wakefield.\r\n\r\nOne must not look for absolute breaches of continuity, even in a\r\nliterary evolution. That the liturgical types of religious drama\r\ncontinued to exist side by side with their popular offshoots, that\r\nhere the clergy continued to present plays, and in spite of a certain\r\nadverse current of ascetic feeling, to assist the lay guilds in divers\r\nways, has already been there shown. It is to be added that the texts\r\nof the plays bear traces to the end of their liturgical origin. The\r\nmusic used is reminiscent of church melodies[426]. The dialogue at\r\ncritical moments follows the traditional lines and occasionally even\r\nreverts to the actual Latin of the _repraesentationes_. More than one\r\nplay—the Towneley _Iuditium_, the Croxton _Sacrament_, the Digby _St.\r\nMary Magdalen_—closes with the _Te Deum_ which habitually ended Matins\r\nwhen the dramatic interpolation of the office was over. And what are\r\nthe _Expositor_ of the _Ludus Coventriae_, the _Doctor_ of the Brome\r\nplay, or even _Balaeus Prolocutor_ himself, but the lineal descendants,\r\nthrough the dramatized St. Augustine, of certain German plays and the\r\n_appellatores_ or _vocatores_ of the _Prophetae_, of the priest who read\r\nthe pseudo-Augustinian Christmas _lectio_ from which the _Prophetae_\r\nsprang? Survivals such as these impress upon the student the unity of the\r\nwhole religious drama of the Middle Ages, from trope to Corpus Christi\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMORALITIES, PUPPET-PLAYS, AND PAGEANTS\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._—The English moralities are well\r\n    treated from a literary point of view in the books by Ten\r\n    Brink, Ward, Creizenach, Pollard, Collier, Klein, Symonds,\r\n    Bates, Jusserand, and Courthope, named in the bibliographical\r\n    note to Chapter xxi, and also in the Introduction to A. Brandl,\r\n    _Quellen des weltlichen Dramas in England vor Shakespeare_\r\n    (1898). Some texts not easily available elsewhere are given in\r\n    the same book; others are in Dodsley’s _A Select Collection of\r\n    Old English Plays_ (ed. W. C. Hazlitt, 1874-6), vol. i, and J.\r\n    M. Manly, _Specimens of the Pre-Shakespearean Drama_ (1897),\r\n    vol. i. Extracts are given by Pollard. Lists both of popular\r\n    moralities and of moral interludes will be found in Appendix X.\r\n    The French plays of a similar type are dealt with by L. Petit\r\n    de Julleville, _La Comédie et les Mœurs en France au Moyen\r\n    Âge_ (1886) and _Répertoire du Théâtre comique en France au\r\n    Moyen Âge_ (1886).—On puppet-plays, C. Magnin, _Histoire des\r\n    Marionnettes en Europe_ (1852), and A. Dieterich, _Pulcinella_\r\n    (1897), may be consulted. The traditional text of the stock\r\n    English play is printed, with illustrations by G. Cruikshank,\r\n    in J. P. Collier, _Punch and Judy_ (1870). English pageants at\r\n    the Corpus Christi feast and at royal entries are discussed\r\n    by C. Davidson, _English Mystery Plays_ (1892), § xvii, and\r\n    Sir J. B. Paul, in _Scottish Review_, xxx (1897), 217, and\r\n    the corresponding French _mystères mimés_ by L. Petit de\r\n    Julleville, _Les Mystères_ (1880).]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to trace from its ritual origins the full development\r\nof that leading and characteristic type of mediaeval drama, the\r\nmiracle-play. I now propose to deal, very briefly, with certain further\r\noutgrowths which, in the autumn of the Middle Ages, sprang from the\r\nmiracle-play stock; and a final book will endeavour to bring together\r\nthe scattered threads of this discursive inquiry, and to touch upon that\r\ntransformation of the mediaeval into the humanist type of drama, which\r\nprepared the way for the great Elizabethan stage.\r\n\r\nThe miracle-play lent itself to modification in two directions: firstly,\r\nby an extension of its subject-matter; and secondly, by an adaptation\r\nof its themes and the methods to other forms of entertainment which,\r\nalthough mimetic, were not, in the full sense of the term, dramatic.\r\nThere are a few plays upon record which were apparently represented\r\nafter the traditional manner of miracles, but differ from these in that\r\nthey treat subjects not religious, but secular. Extant examples must\r\nbe sought in the relics, not of the English, but of the continental\r\ndrama. The earliest is the French _Estoire de Griselidis_, a version\r\nof the story familiar in Chaucer’s _Clerkes Tale_, which was written\r\nand acted, according to the manuscript, in 1395[427]. Slightly later is\r\na Dutch manuscript which contains, amongst other things, probably the\r\n_répertoire_ of some _compagnie joyeuse_, three plays on the subjects\r\nrespectively of Esmoreit, Gloriant of Brunswick, and Lanseloet and\r\nSanderijn[428]. Both the French and Dutch plays belong to what may be\r\ncalled the wider circle of chivalric romance. An obvious link between\r\nsuch pieces and the ordinary miracle-play is to be found in those of\r\nthe _Miracles de Nostre Dame_ which, like _Amis et Amiles_ or _Robert\r\nle Diable_, also handle topics of chivalric romance, but only such as\r\nare brought technically within the scope of the miracle-play by the\r\nintervention of the Virgin at some point of the action[429]. Similarly,\r\nanother French play, dating from about 1439, on the subject, drawn not\r\nfrom romance but from contemporary history, of the Siege of Orleans,\r\nmay be explained by the sanctity already attributed in the national\r\nimagination to Joan of Arc, who is naturally its leading figure[430].\r\nBut the usual range of subject was certainly departed from when Jacques\r\nMillet, a student at Orleans, compiled, between 1450 and 1452, an immense\r\n_mystère_ in 30,000 lines on the _Istoire de la destruction de Troye la\r\ngrant_[431]. In England, the few examples of the mingling of secular\r\nelements with the miracle-plays which present themselves during the\r\nsixteenth century can hardly be regarded as mediaeval[432]. The only\r\ntheme which need be noticed here is that of King Robert of Sicily. A play\r\non this hero, revived at the High Cross at Chester in 1529, is stated\r\nin a contemporary letter to have been originally written in the reign\r\nof Henry VII. But a still earlier _ludus de Kyng Robert of Cesill_ is\r\nrecorded in the Lincoln _Annales_ under the year 1453.\r\n\r\nFar more important than this slight secular extension of miracle-plays\r\nis another development in the direction of allegory, giving rise to\r\nthe ‘moral plays’ or ‘moralities,’ as they came to be indifferently\r\ncalled[433], in which the characters are no longer scriptural or\r\nlegendary persons, but wholly, or almost wholly, abstractions, and which,\r\nalthough still religious in intention, aim rather at ethical cultivation\r\nthan the stablishing of faith. The earliest notices of morals are found\r\nabout the end of the fourteenth century, at a time when the influence\r\nof the _Roman de la Rose_ and other widely popular works was bringing\r\nevery department of literature under the sway of allegory[434]. That the\r\ndrama also should be touched with the spirit of the age was so inevitable\r\nas hardly to call for comment. But it will be interesting to point out\r\nsome at least of the special channels through which the new tendency\r\nestablished itself. In the first place there is the twelfth-century\r\nLatin play of _Antichristus_. In a sense the whole content of this may\r\nbe called allegorical, and the allegory becomes formal in such figures\r\nas _Heresis_ and _Ypocrisis_, _Iustitia_ and _Misericordia_, and in\r\nthose of _Ecclesia_, _Synagoga_, and _Gentilitas_, suggested to the\r\nclerkly author by a well-known _disputatio_. The same theme recurs in\r\nmore than one later play[435]. Secondly, there is the theme of the\r\nReconciliation of the Heavenly Virtues, which is suggested by the\r\nwords of the eighty-fifth Psalm: ‘Mercy and Truth are met together:\r\nRighteousness and Peace have kissed each other.’ This is treated in two\r\nunprinted and little known French plays, also of the twelfth century,\r\nwhich I have not as yet had occasion to mention and of which I borrow the\r\nfollowing analysis from Dr. Ward: ‘These four virtues appear personified\r\nas four sisters, who meet together after the Fall of Man before the\r\nthrone of God to conduct one of those disputations which were so much in\r\naccordance with the literary tastes of the age; Truth and Righteousness\r\nspeak against the guilty Adam, while Mercy and Peace plead in his favour.\r\nConcord is restored among the four sisters by the promise of a Saviour,\r\nwho shall atone to Divine Justice on behalf of man.’ One of these pieces\r\nis ascribed to the Anglo-Norman poet, Guillaume Herman (1127-70),\r\nthe other to Stephen Langton, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury.\r\nThey are generally spoken of as literary exercises, not intended for\r\nrepresentation[436]. But it is obvious that they might very well find\r\ntheir places in miracle-play cycles, as links between the scenes dealing\r\nrespectively with the Fall and the Redemption. Further, precisely such\r\nan episode, in precisely such a position, does occur, three hundred\r\nyears later, in the English cycle known as the _Ludus Coventriae_. Nor\r\nis this the only allegorical element which distinguishes a certain part\r\nof this patchwork cycle from nearly all the other English plays[437]. It\r\nis not, perhaps, of great importance that in the Assumption scene the\r\nrisen Christ receives the name of _Sapientia_, or that _Contemplatio_\r\nis the ‘exposytour in doctorys wede,’ by whom several other scenes are\r\nintroduced. But there is a striking passage at the end of the Slaughter\r\nof the Innocents, where ‘Dethe, Goddys masangere,’ intervenes to make\r\nan end of the tyrannic Herod[438], and here, I think, may clearly be\r\ntraced yet a third stream of allegorical tendency making its way into\r\nthe drama from that singular _danse macabre_ or ‘Dance of Death,’ which\r\nexercised so powerful a fascination on the art of the Middle Ages. Death\r\nhobnobbing with pope and king and clown, with lord and lady, with priest\r\nand merchant, with beggar and fool, the irony is familiar in many a long\r\nseries of frescoes and engravings. Nor are cases lacking in which it\r\nwas directly adapted for scenic representation. An alleged example at\r\nParis in 1424 was probably only a painting. But in 1449 a _certain jeu,\r\nhistoire et moralité sur le fait de la danse macabre_ was acted before\r\nPhilip the Good at Bruges, and a similar performance is recorded at\r\nBesançon in 1453[439].\r\n\r\nThe process of introducing abstractions into the miracle-plays themselves\r\ndoes not seem to have been carried very far. On the other hand, the\r\nmoralities, if God and the Devil may be regarded as abstractions, admit\r\nof nothing else. Two at least of the motives just enumerated, the Dance\r\nof Death and the Reconciliation of the Heavenly Virtues, recur in them.\r\nBut both are subordinate to a third, which may be called the Conflict of\r\nVice and Virtue. This _débat_-like theme is of course familiar in every\r\nbranch of allegorical literature. Prof. Creizenach traces one type of it,\r\nin which the conflict is conceived under the symbols of siege or battle,\r\nto the _Psychomachia_ of Prudentius[440], and perhaps even further to\r\nthe passage about the ‘whole armour of God’ in St. Paul’s epistle to the\r\nEphesians[441]. For the purposes of the stage it is eminently suitable,\r\nboth because it lends itself to many and various modes of representation,\r\nand because conflict is the very stuff out of which drama is wrought.\r\n\r\nAs the earliest notices of moralities are found in English records and as\r\nthis particular development of the drama is thoroughly well represented\r\nin English texts, I may save space by confining my attention to these,\r\nmerely noting as I pass the contemporary existence of precisely parallel\r\nrecords and texts on the continent and particularly in France[442]. The\r\nfirst English moralities seem to have been known as _Paternoster_ plays.\r\nSuch a play is mentioned by Wyclif about 1378 as existing at York, and\r\nat some date previous to 1389 a special guild _Orationis Domini_ was\r\nfounded in that city for its maintenance. The play, however, survived the\r\nguild, and was acted from time to time as a substitute for the ordinary\r\nCorpus Christi plays up to 1572. Similarly, at Beverley a _Paternoster_\r\nplay was acted by the crafts, probably in emulation of that of York,\r\nin 1469, while a third is mentioned in Lincoln documents as played at\r\nvarious dates from 1397 to 1521. Although all these _Paternoster_ plays\r\nare lost, their general character can be made clear. In that of York ‘all\r\nmanner of vices and sins were held up to scorn and the virtues were held\r\nup to praise,’ while an incidental entry in a _computus_ shows that one\r\ndivision of it was known as the _ludus accidiae_. The information to be\r\nderived from Beverley is even more explicit. There were eight pageants.\r\nOne was assigned to ‘Vicious,’ probably a typical representative of frail\r\nhumanity, the other seven to the seven deadly sins which beset him,\r\n‘Pryde: Invy: Ire: Avaryce: Sleweth (or Accidie): Glotony: Luxuria.’\r\nThe _Paternoster_ play seems, therefore, to have been in some fashion a\r\ndramatization of the struggle of the vices and the corresponding virtues\r\nfor the soul of man, and the name given to it may be explained by the\r\nmediaeval notion that each clause of the Lord’s Prayer was of specific\r\nmerit against one of the deadly sins[443]. Here then is one version of\r\njust that theme of the Conflict of Vice and Virtue noted as dominant in\r\nthe moralities.\r\n\r\nOf the half dozen extant English moralities which can with any\r\nplausibility be assigned to the fifteenth century, two are based upon\r\na motive akin to that of the Dance of Death. These are the fragmentary\r\n_Pride of Life_, which is the earliest of the group, and _Everyman_,\r\nwhich is by far the finest[444]. In the former Death and Life contend\r\nfor the soul of _Rex Vivus_, the representative of humanity, who is only\r\nsaved from the fiends by the intervention of the Virgin. In the latter,\r\nGod sends Death to summon Everyman, who finds to his dismay that of\r\nall his earthly friends only Good Deeds is willing to accompany him.\r\nThe Conflict of Vice and Virtue is resumed in the moral of _Mundus et\r\nInfans_ and in the three morals of the Macro manuscript, the _Castle of\r\nPerseverance_, _Mind, Will and Understanding_, and _Mankind_. In all\r\nfour plays the representative of humanity, _Infans_ or _Humanum Genus_\r\nor _Anima_ or Mankind, is beset by the compulsion or swayed this way and\r\nthat by the persuasion of allegorized good and bad qualities. At the end\r\nof the _Castle of Perseverance_ the motive of the Reconciliation of the\r\nHeavenly Virtues is introduced in a scene closely resembling that of the\r\n_Ludus Coventriae_ or the earlier essays of Guillaume Herman and Stephen\r\nLangton.\r\n\r\nA somewhat unique position between miracle-play and morality is occupied\r\nby the Mary Magdalen drama contained in the Digby manuscript. The\r\naction of this, so far as it is scriptural or legendary, has already\r\nbeen summarized[445]; but it must now be added that the episodes of\r\nthe secular life of the Magdalen _in gaudio_ are conceived in a wholly\r\nallegorical vein. The ‘kyngs of the world and the flesch’ and the ‘prynse\r\nof dylles’ are introduced with the seven deadly sins and a good and\r\na bad angel. The castle of Magdala, like the castle of Perseverance,\r\nis besieged. The Magdalen is led into a tavern by _Luxuria_ and there\r\nbetrayed by Curiosity, a gallant. We have to do less with a mystery\r\nbeginning to show morality elements than with a deliberate combination\r\neffected by a writer familiar with both forms of drama.\r\n\r\nThe manner of presentation of the fifteenth-century moralities did not\r\ndiffer from that of the contemporary miracle-plays. The manuscript of the\r\n_Castle of Perseverance_ contains a prologue delivered by _vexillatores_\r\nafter the fashion of the _Ludus Coventriae_ and the Croxton _Sacrament_.\r\nThere is also, as in the Cornish mysteries published by Mr. Norris, a\r\ndiagram showing a circular ‘place’ bounded by a ditch or fence, with a\r\ncentral ‘castel’ and five ‘skaffoldys’ for the principal performers.\r\nUnder the castle is ‘Mankynde, is bed’ and near it ‘Coveytyse cepbord.’\r\nThe scaffolds are the now familiar _loca_ or _sedes_. The scantier\r\nindications of more than one of the other moralities proper suggest\r\nthat they also were performed in an outdoor ‘place’ with _sedes_, and a\r\nsimilar arrangement is pointed to by the stage directions of the _Mary\r\nMagdalen_. Nor could the moralities dispense with those attractions of\r\ndevils and hell-fire which had been so popular in their predecessors.\r\nBelial, in the _Castle of Perseverance_, is to have gunpowder burning\r\nin pipes in his hands and ears and other convenient parts of his body;\r\n_Anima_, in _Mind, Will and Understanding_, has little devils running\r\nin and out beneath her skirts; and in _Mary Magdalen_, the ‘prynse of\r\ndylles’ enters in ‘a stage, and Helle ondyr-neth that stage.’ The later\r\nmoralities, of which the sixteenth century affords several examples, were\r\npresented under somewhat different conditions, which will be discussed in\r\nanother chapter[446]. Allusions to the ‘morals at Manningtree,’ however,\r\nin the beginning of the seventeenth century, suggest that moralities may\r\nhave continued in out-of-the-way places to hold the open-air stage, just\r\nas miracle-plays here and there did, to a comparatively late date. Actual\r\nexamples of the more popular type of morality from the sixteenth century\r\nare afforded by Skelton’s _Magnificence_ and by Sir David Lyndsay’s\r\n_Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis_, shown successively at Linlithgow in 1540,\r\non the Castle-hill at Cupar of Fife in 1552, and in the Greenside at\r\nEdinburgh about 1554. This remarkable piece differs in many ways from the\r\nEnglish moralities. The theme consists of the arraignment of the estates\r\nof the realm before _Rex Humanitas_. Various ‘vycis’ and allegorical\r\npersonages appear and plead, and the action is enlivened by farcical\r\ninterludes for the amusement of the vulgar, and wound up by a sermon of\r\n‘Folie,’ which points rather to French than to English models[447]. The\r\nflight of time is also shown by the fact that the _Satyre_ aims less at\r\nthe moral edification with which the fifteenth-century plays contented\r\nthemselves, than at the introduction of a sharp polemic against abuses in\r\nchurch and state. Skelton’s _Magnificence_ had also, not improbably, some\r\npolitical bearing. To this matter also I return in another chapter[448].\r\n\r\nMiracle-plays and moralities ranked amongst the most widespread and\r\ncoloured elements, century after century, of burgher and even of\r\nvillage life. It is not surprising that their subjects and their\r\nmethods exercised a powerful influence upon other manifestations of the\r\nmediaeval spirit. The share which their vivid and sensuous presentations\r\nof religious ideas had in shaping the conceptions of artists and\r\nhandicraftsmen is a fascinating topic of far too wide a scope to be even\r\ntouched upon here[449]. But a few pages must be devoted to indicating\r\nthe nature of their overflow into various pseudo-dramatic, rather than\r\nstrictly dramatic, forms of entertainment.\r\n\r\nOne of these is the puppet-show. It has been pointed out, in speaking\r\nof the liturgical drama, that the use of puppets to provide a figured\r\nrepresentation of the mystery of the Nativity, seems to have preceded\r\nthe use for the same purpose of living and speaking persons; and\r\nfurther, that the puppet-show, in the form of the ‘Christmas crib,’ has\r\noutlived the drama founded upon it, and is still in use in all Catholic\r\ncountries[450]. An analogous custom is the laying of the crucifix in\r\nthe ‘sepulchre’ during the Easter ceremonies, and there is one English\r\nexample of a complete performance of a Resurrection play by ‘certain\r\nsmalle puppets, representinge the Persons of Christe, the Watchmen, Marie\r\nand others.’ This is described by a seventeenth-century writer as taking\r\nplace at Witney in Oxfordshire ‘in the dayes of ceremonial religion,’ and\r\none of the watchmen, which made a clacking noise, was ‘comonly called\r\nJack Snacker of Wytney[451].’ This points to the use of some simple\r\nmechanical device by which motion was imparted to some at least of the\r\npuppets. A similar contrivance was produced by Bishop Barlow to point a\r\nsermon against idolatry at Paul’s Cross in 1547 and was given afterwards\r\nto the boys to break into pieces[452]. More elaborate representations of\r\nmiracle-plays by means of moving puppets or _marionnettes_ make their\r\nappearance in all parts of Europe at a period when the regular dramatic\r\nperformances of similar subjects were already becoming antiquated, nor\r\ncan they be said to be even yet quite extinct[453]. Most of them belong\r\nto the repertory of the professional showmen, and it will be remembered\r\nthat some form or other of _marionnette_ seems to have been handed\r\ndown continuously amongst the minstrel class from Roman times[454]. In\r\nEngland the puppet-shows were much in vogue at such places as Bartholomew\r\nFair, where they became serious rivals of the living actors[455]. The\r\nearliest name for them was ‘motions[456].’ Italian players brought ‘an\r\ninstrument of strange motions’ to London in 1574[457]. Autolycus, in\r\n_The Winter’s Tale_, amongst his other shifts for a living, ‘compassed\r\na motion of the Prodigal Son[458].’ Ben Jonson, in _Bartholomew Fair_,\r\nintroduces one Lanthorn Leatherhead, a puppet-showman, who presents in\r\nhis booth a curious rigmarole of a motion in which Hero and Leander,\r\nDamon and Pythias, and Dionysius are all mixed up[459]. It would appear\r\nto have been customary for the showman, like his brethren of the modern\r\nPunch and Judy, to ‘interpret’ for the puppets by reciting a suitable\r\ndialogue as an accompaniment to their gestures[460]. The repertory\r\nof Lanthorn Leatherhead contained a large proportion of ‘motions’ on\r\nsubjects borrowed from the miracle-play. Similar titles occur in the\r\nnotices of later performances at Bartholomew Fair[461] and of those\r\ngiven by the popular London showman, Robert Powell, during the reign\r\nof Queen Anne[462]. In more recent times all other puppet-shows have\r\nbeen outdone by the unique vogue of Punch and Judy[463]. The derivation\r\nof these personages from the Pontius Pilate and Judas Iscariot of the\r\nmiracle-plays is the merest philological whimsy. Punch is doubtless the\r\nPulcinella[464], who makes his appearance about 1600 as a stock figure\r\nin the impromptu comedy of Naples. Under other names his traditions may,\r\nfor all one knows, go back far beyond the miracle-plays to the _fabulae\r\nAtellanae_. But the particular drama in which alone he now takes the\r\nstage, although certainly not a miracle-play, follows closely upon the\r\ntraditional lines of the moralities[465].\r\n\r\nAnother kind of religious dumb-show, at once more ancient and more\r\nimportant than that of the puppets, was presented by living persons\r\nin the ‘ridings’ or processions which formed an integral part of so\r\nmany mediaeval festivals. Like the miracle-plays themselves, these\r\n_tableaux_ reached their highest point of elaboration in connexion with\r\nthe ceremonies of Corpus Christi day; and, in order to understand their\r\nrelation to the regular dramas, it is necessary to return for a moment\r\nto the early history of the great feast. It has already been suggested\r\nthat the processional character of the great English craft-cycles, with\r\ntheir movable pageants and their ‘stations,’ may be explained on the\r\nhypothesis, that the performances were at one time actually given during\r\nthe ‘stations’ or pauses before temporary street altars of the Corpus\r\nChristi procession itself. The obvious inconveniences of such a custom,\r\nif it really existed, might not unnaturally lead to its modification.\r\nExcept at Draguignan, where the dialogue was reduced to the briefest\r\nlimits, no actual traces of it are left[466]. In England the difficulty\r\nseems to have been solved at Newcastle by sending the pageants round with\r\nthe procession in the early morning and deferring the actual plays until\r\nthe afternoon. At Coventry representatives of the _dramatis personae_\r\nappear to have ridden in the procession, the cumbrous pageants being\r\nleft behind until they were needed. Herod, for instance, rode on behalf\r\nof the smiths. At other places, again, the separation between procession\r\nand play was even more complete. The crafts which produced the plays were\r\nas a rule also burdened by their ordinances with the duties of providing\r\na light and of walking or riding in honour of the host; but the two\r\nceremonies took place at different hours on the same day, and there was\r\nno external relation, so far as the evidence goes, between them. Even\r\nso there was still some clashing, and at York, after an unsuccessful\r\nattempt on the part of the clergy in 1426 to get the plays put off, the\r\nprocession itself appears to have been transferred to the following day.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the difficulty seems to have been met in certain towns\r\nby suppressing the plays and reducing them to dumb-show ‘pageants’\r\ncarried in the procession. Lists are extant of such pageants as they\r\nwere assigned to the crafts at Dublin in 1498 and at Hereford in 1503,\r\nand although it is not of course impossible that there were to be\r\nplays later in the day, there is no proof that this was the case. For\r\na similar procession of _tableaux_ held in London, in the earlier part\r\nof the fifteenth century, a set of descriptive verses was written by\r\nJohn Lydgate, and the adoption of this method of ‘interpreting’ the\r\ndumb-show seems to put the possibility of a regular dramatic performance\r\nout of court[467]. There were pageants also in the Corpus Christi\r\nprocessions at Bungay and at Bury St. Edmunds, but the notices are too\r\nfragmentary to permit of more than a conjecture as to whether they were\r\naccompanied by plays. The _tableaux_ shown at Dublin, Hereford, and\r\nLondon were of a continuous and cyclical character, although at Hereford\r\nSt. Catherine, and at Dublin King Arthur, the Nine Worthies, and St.\r\nGeorge’s dragon were tacked on at the tail of the procession[468]. A\r\ncontinental parallel is afforded by the twenty-eight _remontrances_,\r\nmaking a complete cycle from the Annunciation to the Last Judgement,\r\nshown at Béthune in 1549[469]. But elsewhere, both in England and abroad,\r\nthe shows of the Corpus Christi procession were of a much less systematic\r\ncharacter, and Dublin was not the only place where secular elements crept\r\nin[470]. At Coventry, in addition to the representative figures from the\r\ncraft-plays, the guild of Corpus Christi and St. Nicholas, to which,\r\nas to special Corpus Christi guilds elsewhere, the general supervision\r\nof the procession fell, provided in 1539 a Mary and a Gabriel with the\r\nlily, Saints Catherine and Margaret, eight Virgins and twelve Apostles.\r\nThe Coventry procession, it may be added, outlived the Corpus Christi\r\nfeast. In the seventeenth century Godiva had been placed in it and became\r\nthe most important feature. By the nineteenth century the wool-combers\r\nhad a shepherd and shepherdess, their patron saint Bishop Blaize, and\r\nJason with the Golden Fleece[471]. At the Shrewsbury ‘Show,’ which also\r\nuntil a recent date continued the tradition of an older Corpus Christi\r\nprocession, Saints Crispin and Crispinian rode for the shoemakers. At\r\nNorwich the grocers sent the ‘griffin’ from the top of their pageant and\r\na ‘tree’ which may have been the tree of knowledge from their Whitsun\r\nplay of Paradise, but which was converted by festoons of fruit and\r\nspicery into an emblem of their trade[472].\r\n\r\nAberdeen seems to have been distinguished by having two great mimetic\r\nprocessions maintained by the guilds. The interpretation of the data is\r\nrather difficult, but apparently the ‘Haliblude’ play, which existed in\r\n1440 and 1479, had given way by 1531 to a procession in which pageants\r\nof the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the Coronation of the Virgin\r\nwere eked out by others of Saints Sebastian, Laurence, Stephen, Martin,\r\nNicholas, John, and George. The other procession seems originally to\r\nhave been introduced as an episode in a play of the Presentation in the\r\nTemple on Candlemas day. Its ‘personnes’ or ‘pageants’ are such as might\r\nfurnish out the action of a short Nativity cycle, together with ‘honest\r\nsquiares’ from each craft, ‘wodmen,’ and minstrels. But in this case also\r\nthe play seems to have vanished early in the sixteenth century, while the\r\nprocession certainly endured until a much later date.\r\n\r\nThere are no other English religious dumb-shows, outside those of Corpus\r\nChristi day, so elaborate as the Aberdeen Candlemas procession. On the\r\nsame day at Beverley the guild of St. Mary carried a pageant of the\r\nVirgin and Child with Saints Joseph and Simon and two angels holding\r\na great candlestick[473]. The guild of St. Helen, on the day of the\r\nInvention of the Cross (May 3), had a procession with a boy to represent\r\nthe saint, and two men bearing a cross and a shovel[474]. The guild of\r\nSt. William of Norwich paraded a knave-child between two men holding\r\ncandles in honour of the youthful martyr[475]. In the Whitsuntide\r\nprocession at Leicester walked the Virgin and Saint Martin, with the\r\ntwelve Apostles[476]. More interesting is the pageant of St. Thomas\r\nthe Martyr on December 29 at Canterbury, with the saint on a cart and\r\nknights played by children and an altar and a device of an angel and\r\na ‘leder bag for the blode[477].’ Probably this list could be largely\r\nincreased were it worth while[478]. The comparatively modern elements\r\nin the Corpus Christi pageantry of Coventry, Shrewsbury, and Dublin\r\nmay be paralleled from the eighteenth-century festival of the Preston\r\nguild merchant on or near St. John Baptist’s day with its Crispin and\r\nCrispinian, Bishop Blaize, Adam and Eve, Vulcan, and so forth[479],\r\nor the nineteenth-century wool trade procession on St. Blasius’ day\r\n(February 3), at Bradford, in which once more Bishop Blaize, with the\r\nJason and Medea of the Golden Fleece, appears[480]. It is noticeable how,\r\nas such functions grow more civic and less religious, the pageants tend\r\nto become distinctively emblematic of the trades concerned. The same\r\nfeature is to be observed in the choice of subjects for the plays given\r\nby way of entertainment to the earl of Kildare at Dublin in 1528.\r\n\r\nThe dumb-show pageants, which in many cities glorified the ‘ridings’ on\r\nthe day of St. George (April 23), have been described in an earlier\r\nchapter[481]. These ‘ridings,’ of curiously mingled religious and folk\r\norigin, stand midway between the processions just mentioned and such\r\nseasonal perambulations as the ‘shows’ and ‘watches’ of Midsummer. Even\r\nin the latter, elements borrowed from the pageants of the miracle-plays\r\noccasionally form an odd blend with the ‘giants’ and other figures of the\r\n‘folk’ tradition[482]. The ‘wache and playe’ went together at Wymondham,\r\nand also apparently at Chelmsford, in the sixteenth century. At York\r\nwe find the pageants of some of the crafts borrowed for a play, though\r\napparently a classical and not a religious one, at the Midsummer show\r\nof 1585. At Chester, when the Whitsun plays were beginning to fall into\r\ndesuetude, the crafts were regularly represented in the Midsummer show\r\nby some of their _dramatis personae_, who, however, rode without their\r\npageants. The smiths sent ‘the Doctors and little God,’ the butchers sent\r\n‘the divill in his fethers,’ the barbers sent Abraham and Isaac, the\r\nbricklayers sent Balaam and the Ass, and so forth. These with the giants,\r\na dragon, a man in woman’s clothes, naked boys, morris-dancers and other\r\nfolk elements, made up a singular cavalcade.\r\n\r\nIn London, pageants were provided for the Midsummer show by the guilds\r\nto which the lord mayor and sheriffs for the year belonged. Thus the\r\ndrapers had a pageant of the Golden Fleece in 1522, and pageants of the\r\nAssumption and Saint Ursula in 1523[483]. To a modern imagination the\r\ntype of civic pageantry is the annual procession at the installation of\r\nthe lord mayor in November, known familiarly as the lord mayor’s show.\r\nThis show was important enough from the middle of the sixteenth century,\r\nand the pens of many goodly poets, Peele, Dekker, Munday, Middleton, and\r\nothers, were employed in its service[484]. But its history cannot be\r\ntaken much further back, and it is exceedingly probable that when the\r\nMidsummer show came to an end in 1538, the pageants were transferred to\r\nthe installation procession. The earliest clear notice is in 1540, when\r\na pageant of the Assumption, perhaps that which had already figured at\r\nthe Midsummer show of 1523, was used[485]. The ironmongers had a pageant\r\nwhen the lord mayor was chosen from their body in 1566. It was arranged\r\nby James Peele, father of the dramatist, and there were two ‘wodmen’ in\r\nit, but unfortunately it is not further described[486]. In 1568, Sir\r\nThomas Roe, merchant tailor, had a pageant of John the Baptist[487].\r\nWilliam Smith, writing an account of city customs in 1575, mentions, as a\r\nregular feature of the procession, ‘the Pagent of Triumph richly decked,\r\nwhereupon, by certain figures and writings, some matter touching Justice\r\nand the office of a Magistrate is represented[488].’ And about ten years\r\nlater the series of printed ‘Devices’ of the pageants begins.\r\n\r\nThe influence of miracle-plays and moralities is also to be looked for\r\nin the municipal ‘shows’ of welcome provided at the state entries of\r\nroyal and other illustrious visitors. A large number of these, chiefly at\r\ncoronations, royal marriages and the like, are recorded in chronicles of\r\nLondon origin, and with the London examples in their chronological order\r\nI will briefly deal. The earlier features of such ceremonies include\r\nthe riding of the mayor and corporation to meet the king at some place\r\noutside the gates, such as Blackheath, or, in the case of a coronation,\r\nat the Tower, and the escorting of him with joyous _tripudium_ or\r\n_carole_ to the palace of Westminster, the reading of loyal addresses\r\nand the giving of golden gifts, the decking of walls and balconies with\r\ncostly robes and tapestries, the filling of the conduits with wine, white\r\nand red, in place of the accustomed water[489]. The first example of\r\npageantry in the proper sense occurs about the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, in certain ‘devices and marvels’ shown at the wedding of Henry\r\nIII to Eleanor of Provence in 1236[490]. These are not described in\r\ndetail; but when Edward I returned to London after the defeat of William\r\nWallace at Falkirk in 1298, it is recorded by a chronicler, quoted in\r\nStowe’s _Annals_, that the crafts made ‘great and solemne triumph’ and\r\nthat the fishmongers in particular ‘amongst other pageantes and shewes’\r\nhad, as it was St. Magnus’s day, one of the saint accompanied by a\r\nthousand horsemen, and preceded by four gilded sturgeons, four salmons\r\non horseback and ‘sixe and fourtie knights armed, riding on horses made\r\nlike luces of the sea[491].’ It was the fishmongers again who on the\r\nbirth of Edward III in 1313 went in a _chorea_ to Westminster with an\r\ningeniously contrived ship in full sail, and escorted the queen on her\r\nway to Eltham[492]. At the coronation of Richard II in 1377 an elaborate\r\ncastle was put up at the head of Cheapside. On the four towers of this\r\nstood four white-robed damsels, who wafted golden leaves in the king’s\r\nface, dropped gilt models of coin upon him and his steed, and offered\r\nhim wine from pipes laid on to the structure. Between the towers was a\r\ngolden angel, which by a mechanical device bent forward and held out a\r\ncrown as Richard drew near[493]. Similar stages, with a _coelicus ordo_\r\nof singers and boys and maidens offering wine and golden crowns, stood\r\nin Cheapside when Richard again rode through the city in 1392, in token\r\nof reconciliation with the rebellious Londoners. And at St. Paul’s was a\r\nyouth enthroned amongst a triple circle of singing angels; and at Temple\r\nBar St. John Baptist in the desert surrounded by all kinds of trees and\r\na menagerie of strange beasts[494]. No similar details of pageantry are\r\nrecorded at the coronations of Henry IV or Henry V. But when the latter\r\nking returned to London after the battle of Agincourt in 1415 there was\r\na very fine show indeed. The procession came to the city from Eltham and\r\nBlackheath by way of London Bridge. Upon the tower masking the bridge\r\nstood two gigantic figures, one a man with an axe in his right hand and\r\nthe city keys in his left, the other a woman in a scarlet mantle. Beyond\r\nthis were two columns painted to resemble white marble and green jasper,\r\non which were a lion and an antelope bearing the royal arms and banner.\r\nOver the foot of the bridge was a tower with a figure of St. George,\r\nand on a house hard by a number of boys representing the heavenly host,\r\nwho sang the anthem _Benedictus qui venit in nomine Dei_. The tower\r\nupon the Cornhill conduit was decked with red and had on it a company\r\nof prophets, who sent a flight of sparrows and other birds fluttering\r\nround the king as he passed, while the prophets chanted _Cantate Domino\r\ncanticum novum_. The tower of the great Cheapside conduit was green,\r\nand here were twelve Apostles and twelve Kings, Martyrs and Confessors\r\nof England, whose anthem was _Benedic, anima, Domino_, and who, even\r\nas Melchisedek received Abraham with bread and wine, offered the king\r\nthin wafers mixed with silver leaves, and a cup filled from the conduit\r\npipes. On Cheapside, the cross was completely hidden by a great castle,\r\nin imitation white marble and green and red jasper, out of the door of\r\nwhich issued a bevy of virgins, with timbrel and dance and songs of\r\n‘Nowell, Nowell,’ like unto the daughters of Israel who danced before\r\nDavid after the slaying of Goliath. On the castle stood boys feathered\r\nlike angels, who sang _Te Deum_ and flung down gold coins and boughs of\r\nlaurel. Finally, on the tower of the little conduit near St. Paul’s, all\r\nblue as the sky, were more virgins who, as when Richard II was crowned,\r\nwafted golden leaves out of golden cups, while above were wrought angels\r\nin gold and colours, and an image of the sun enthroned[495]. The details\r\nof the reception of Henry and Catherine of France, six years later, are\r\nnot preserved[496]. Nor are those of the London coronation of Henry\r\nVI in 1429. But there was a grand dumb-show at the Paris coronation\r\nin 1431[497], and it was perhaps in emulation of this that on his\r\nreturn to London in the following year the king was received with a\r\nsplendour equal to that lavished on the victor of Agincourt. There is a\r\ncontemporary account of the proceedings by John Carpenter, the town clerk\r\nof London[498]. As in 1415 a giant greeted the king at the foot of London\r\nBridge. On the same ‘pageant[499]’ two antelopes upbore the arms of\r\nEngland and France. On the bridge stood a magnificent ‘fabric,’ occupied\r\nby Nature, Grace, and Fortune, who gave the king presents as he passed.\r\nTo the right were the seven heavenly Virtues, who signified the seven\r\ngifts of the Holy Ghost, by letting fly seven white doves. To the left,\r\nseven other virgins offered the regalia. Then all fourteen, clapping\r\ntheir hands and rejoicing in _tripudia_, broke into songs of welcome. In\r\nCornhill was the Tabernacle of Lady Wisdom, set upon seven columns. Here\r\nstood Wisdom, and here the seven liberal Sciences were represented by\r\nPriscian, Aristotle, Tully, Boethius, Pythagoras, Euclid, and Albumazar.\r\nOn the conduit was the Throne of Justice, on which sat a king surrounded\r\nby Truth, Mercy, and Clemency, with two Judges and eight Lawyers. In\r\nCheapside was a Paradise with a grove full of all manner of foreign\r\nfruits, and three wells from which gushed out wine, served by Mercy,\r\nGrace, and Pity. Here the king was greeted by Enoch and Elijah[500]. At\r\nthe cross was a castle of jasper with a Tree of Jesse, and another of the\r\nroyal descent; and at St. Paul’s conduit a representation of the Trinity\r\namongst a host of ministering angels. In 1445 Margaret of Anjou came to\r\nLondon to be crowned. Stowe records ‘a few only’ of the pageants. She\r\nentered by Southwark bridge foot where were Peace and Plenty. On the\r\nbridge was Noah’s ship; in Leadenhall, ‘madam Grace Chancelor de Dieu’;\r\non the Tun in Cornhill, St. Margaret; on the conduit in Cheapside, the\r\nWise and Foolish Virgins; at the Cross, the Heavenly Jerusalem; and at\r\nPaul’s Gate, the General Resurrection and Judgement[501].\r\n\r\nThe rapid kingings and unkingings of the wars of the Roses left little\r\ntime and little heart for pageantries, but with the advent of Henry VII\r\nthey begin again, and continue with growing splendour throughout the\r\nTudor century. Space only permits a brief enumeration of the subjects\r\nchosen for set pageants on a few of the more important occasions. Singing\r\nangels and precious gifts, wells of wine and other minor delights may be\r\ntaken for granted[502]. As to the details of Henry VII’s coronation in\r\n1485 and marriage in 1486 the chroniclers are provokingly silent, and\r\nof the many ‘gentlemanlie pageants’ at the coronation of the queen in\r\n1487 the only one specified is ‘a great redde dragon spouting flames of\r\nfyer into the Thames,’ from the ‘bachelors’ barge’ of the lord mayor’s\r\ncompany as she passed up the river from Greenwich to the Tower[503]. At\r\nthe wedding of Prince Arthur to Katharine of Aragon in 1501, ‘vi goodly\r\nbeutiful pageauntes’ lined the way from London Bridge to St. Paul’s.\r\nThe contriver is said to have been none other than Bishop Foxe the\r\ngreat chancellor and the founder of Corpus Christi College in Oxford.\r\nThe subject of the first pageant was the Trinity with Saints Ursula\r\nand Katharine; of the second, the Castle of Portcullis, with Policy,\r\nNobleness, and Virtue; of the third, Raphael, the angel of marriage,\r\nwith Alphonso, Job, and Boethius; of the fourth, the Sphere of the Sun;\r\nof the fifth, the Temple of God; and of the sixth, Honour with the seven\r\nVirtues[504]. As to Henry VIII’s coronation and marriage there is, once\r\nmore, little recorded. In 1522 came Charles V, Emperor of Germany, to\r\nvisit the king, and the city provided eleven pageants ‘very faire and\r\nexcellent to behold[505].’ The ‘great red dragon’ of 1487 reappeared in\r\n1533 when yet another queen, Anne Boleyn, came up from Greenwich to enjoy\r\nher brief triumph. It stood on a ‘foist’ near the lord mayor’s barge,\r\nand in another ‘foist’ was a mount, and on the mount Anne’s device, a\r\nfalcon on a root of gold with white roses and red. The pageants for the\r\nprogress by land on the following day were of children ‘apparelled like\r\nmerchants,’ of Mount Parnassus, of the falcon and mount once more, with\r\nSaint Anne and her children, of the three Graces, of Pallas, Juno, Venus,\r\nand Mercury with the golden apple, of three ladies, and of the Cardinal\r\nVirtues[506]. The next great show was at the coronation of Edward VI\r\nin 1547, and included Valentine and Orson, Grace, Nature, Fortune and\r\nCharity, Sapience and the seven Liberal Sciences, Regality enthroned with\r\nJustice, Mercy and Truth, the Golden Fleece, Edward the Confessor and\r\nSt. George, Truth, Faith, and Justice. There was also a cunning Spanish\r\nrope-dancer, who performed marvels on a cord stretched to the ground\r\nfrom the tower of St. George’s church in St. Paul’s churchyard[507].\r\nMary, in 1553, enjoyed an even more thrilling spectacle in ‘one Peter\r\na Dutchman,’ who stood and waved a streamer on the weathercock of St.\r\nPaul’s steeple. She had eight pageants, of which three were contributed\r\nby the Genoese, Easterlings, and Florentines. The subjects are unknown,\r\nbut that of the Florentines was in the form of a triple arch and had\r\non the top a trumpeting angel in green, who moved his trumpet to the\r\nwonder of the crowd[508]. There were pageants again when Mary brought her\r\nSpanish husband to London in 1554. At the conduit in Gracechurch Street\r\nwere painted the Nine Worthies. One of these was Henry VIII, who was\r\nrepresented as handing a bible to Edward; and the unfortunate painter was\r\ndubbed a knave and a rank traitor and villain by Bishop Gardiner, because\r\nthe bible was not put in the hands of Mary[509]. At the coronation of\r\nElizabeth in 1559, with which this list must close, it was Time and\r\nTruth who offered the English bible to the queen. The same pageant had\r\nrepresentations of a Decayed Commonwealth and a Flourishing Commonwealth,\r\nwhile others figured the Union of York and Lancaster, the Seat of Worthy\r\nGovernance, the Eight Beatitudes, and Deborah the Judge. At Temple\r\nBar, those ancient _palladia_ of London city, the giants Gotmagot and\r\nCorineus, once more made their appearance[510].\r\n\r\nI do not wish to exaggerate the influence exercised by the miracle-plays\r\nand moralities over these London shows. London was not, in the Middle\r\nAges, one of the most dramatic of English cities, and such plays as\r\nthere were were not in the hands of those trade- and craft-guilds to\r\nwhom the glorifying of the receptions naturally fell. The functions\r\ncarried out by the fishmongers in 1298 and 1313 are much of the nature\r\nof masked ridings or ‘disguisings,’ and must be held to have a folk\r\norigin. The ship of 1313 suggests a ‘hobby ship[511].’ Throughout the\r\nshows draw notions from many heterogeneous sources. The giants afford\r\nyet another ‘folk’ element. The gifts of gold and wine and the speeches\r\nof welcome[512] need no explanation. Devices of heraldry are worked in.\r\nThe choirs of boys and girls dressed as angels recall the choirs perched\r\non the battlements of churches in such ecclesiastical ceremonies as the\r\nPalm Sunday procession[513]. The term ‘pageant’ (_pagina_), which first\r\nappears in this connexion in 1432 and is in regular use by the end of the\r\ncentury, is perhaps a loan from the plays, but the structures themselves\r\nappear to have arisen naturally out of attempts to decorate such obvious\r\narchitectural features of the city as London Bridge, the prison known as\r\nthe Tun, and the conduits which stood in Cornhill and Cheapside[514].\r\nIt is chiefly in the selection of themes for the more elaborate mimetic\r\npageants that the reflection of the regular contemporary drama must\r\nbe traced. Such scriptural subjects as John the Baptist of 1392 or\r\nthe Prophets and Apostles of 1415 pretty obviously come from the\r\nmiracle-plays. The groups of allegorical figures which greeted Henry VI\r\nin 1432 are in no less close a relation to the moralities, which were at\r\nthat very moment beginning to outstrip the miracle-plays in popularity.\r\nAnd in the reign of Henry VII the humanist tendencies begin to suggest\r\nsubjects for the pageants as well as to transform the drama itself.\r\n\r\nCertainly one does not find in London or in any English city those\r\n_mystères mimés_ or cyclical dumb-shows, with which the good people of\r\nParis were wont to welcome kings, and which are clearly an adaptation of\r\nthe ordinary miracle-play to the conditions of a royal entry with its\r\nscant time for long drawn-out dialogue. The earliest of these upon record\r\nwas in 1313 when Philip IV entertained Edward II and Isabella. It is not\r\nquite clear whether this was a procession like the disguising called the\r\n_procession du renard_ which accompanied it, or a stationary dumb-show\r\non pageants. But there is no doubt about the _moult piteux mystere de\r\nla Passion de Nostre Seigneur au vif_ given before Charles VI and Henry\r\nV after the treaty of Troyes in 1420, for this is said to have been on\r\n_eschaffaulx_ and to have been modelled on the bas-reliefs around the\r\nchoir of Notre-Dame. Very similar must have been the _moult bel mystere\r\ndu Vieil testament et du Nouvel_ which welcomed the duke of Bedford in\r\n1424 and which _fut fait sans parler ne sans signer, comme ce feussent\r\nymaiges enlevez contre ung mur_. _Sans parler_, again, was the _mystère_\r\nwhich stood on an _eschaffault_ before the church of the Trinity when\r\nHenry VI was crowned, only a few weeks before the London reception\r\nalready mentioned[515].\r\n\r\nIt may be added that in many provincial towns the pageants used at\r\nroyal entries had a far closer affinity to the miracle-plays proper\r\nthan was the case in London. The place most often honoured in this sort\r\nwas Coventry. In 1456 came Queen Margaret and poor mad Henry VI. One\r\nJohn Wedurley of Leicester seems to have been employed to organize a\r\nmagnificent entertainment. At Bablake gate, where stood a Jesse, the\r\nroyal visitors were greeted by Isaiah and Jeremiah. Within the gate was\r\na ‘pagent’ with Saint Edward the Confessor and St. John the Evangelist.\r\nOn the conduit in Smithford Street were the four Cardinal Virtues. In\r\nthe Cheaping were nine pageants for the Nine Worthies. At the cross\r\nthere were angels, and wine flowed, and at another conduit hard by was\r\nSt. Margaret ‘sleyng’ her dragon and a company of angels. The queen\r\nwas so pleased that she returned next year for Corpus Christi day. It\r\nappears from the smiths’ accounts that the pageants used at the reception\r\nwere those kept by the crafts for the plays. The smiths’ pageant was\r\nhad out again in 1461, with Samson upon it, when Edward IV came after\r\nhis coronation, and in 1474 when the young prince Edward came for St.\r\nGeorge’s feast. The shows then represented King Richard II and his court,\r\nPatriarchs and Prophets, St. Edward the Confessor, the Three Kings of\r\nCologne and St. George slaying the dragon. Prince Arthur, in 1498, saw\r\nthe Nine Worthies, the Queen of Fortune, and, once more, Saint George.\r\nFor Henry VIII and Katharine of Aragon in 1511 there were three pageants:\r\non one the ninefold hierarchy of angels, on another ‘divers beautiful\r\ndamsels,’ on the third ‘a goodly stage play.’ The mercers’ pageant\r\n‘stood’ at the visit of the Princess Mary in 1525, and the tanners’,\r\ndrapers’, smiths’, and weavers’ pageants at that of Queen Elizabeth in\r\n1565. I do not know whether it is legitimate to infer that the subjects\r\nrepresented on these occasions were those of the Corpus Christi plays\r\nbelonging to the crafts named[516].\r\n\r\nYork was visited by Richard III in 1483, and there were pageants, the\r\ndetails of which have not been preserved, as well as a performance of\r\nthe Creed play[517]. It was also visited by Henry VII in 1486, and there\r\nexists a civic order prescribing the pageants for that occasion. The\r\nfirst of these was a most ingenious piece of symbolism. There was a\r\nheaven and beneath it ‘a world desolaite, full of treys and floures.’\r\nOut of this sprang ‘a roiall, rich, rede rose’ and ‘an othre rich white\r\nrose,’ to whom all the other flowers did ‘lowte and evidently yeve\r\nsuffrantie.’ Then appeared out of a cloud a crown over the roses, and\r\nthen a city with citizens with ‘Ebrauk’ the founder, who offered the\r\nkeys to the king. The other pageants represented Solomon and the six\r\nHenries, the Castle of David, and Our Lady. There were also devices by\r\nwhich a rain of rose-water and a hailstorm of comfits fell before the\r\nking[518]. During the same progress which took Henry to York, he also\r\nvisited Worcester, where there were pageants and speeches, ‘whiche his\r\nGrace at that Tyme harde not’ but which should have represented Henry VI\r\nand a _Ianitor ad Ianuam_. Thence he went to Hereford, and was greeted\r\nby St. George, King Ethelbert, and Our Lady; thence to Gloucester, where\r\nthe chronicler remarks with some surprise that ‘ther was no Pageant nor\r\nSpeche ordeynede’; and finally to Bristol, where were King Bremmius,\r\nPrudence, Justice, ‘the Shipwrights Pageannt,’ without any speech, and\r\na ‘Pageannte of an Olifaunte, with a Castell on his Bakk’ and ‘The\r\nResurrection of our Lorde in the highest Tower of the same, with certeyne\r\nImagerye smytyng Bellis, and all wente by Veights, merveolously wele\r\ndone[519].’ In 1503 Henry VII’s daughter Margaret married James IV of\r\nScotland, and was received into Edinburgh with pageants of the Judgement\r\nof Paris, the Annunciation, the Marriage of Joseph and Mary, and the Four\r\nVirtues[520]. Eight years later, in 1511, she visited Aberdeen, and the\r\n‘pleasant padgeanes’ included Adam and Eve, the Salutation of the Virgin,\r\nthe _Magi_, and the Bruce[521].\r\n\r\nThe facts brought together in the present chapter show how ‘pageant’\r\ncame to have its ordinary modern sense of a spectacular procession. How\r\nit was replaced by other terms in the sense of ‘play’ will be matter for\r\nthe sequel. It may be added that the name is also given to the elaborate\r\nstructures of carpenters’ and painters’ work used in the early Tudor\r\nmasks[522]. These the masks probably took over from the processions and\r\nreceptions. On the other hand, the receptions, by an elaboration of the\r\nspoken element, developed into the Elizabethan ‘Entertainments,’ which\r\nare often classified as a sub-variety of the mask itself. This action and\r\nreaction of one form of show upon another need not at this stage cause\r\nany surprise. A sixteenth-century synonym for ‘pageant’ is ‘triumph,’\r\nwhich is doubtless a translation of the Italian _trionfo_, a name given\r\nto the _edifizio_ by the early Renascence, in deliberate reminiscence of\r\nclassical terminology[523].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nTHE INTERLUDE\r\n\r\n    Patronage cannot kill art: even in kings’ palaces the sudden\r\n    flower blooms serene.\r\n\r\n                                                        MODERN PLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nPLAYERS OF INTERLUDES\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._—The _Annals of the Stage_ in J. P.\r\n    Collier, _History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (new ed. 1879),\r\n    although ill arranged and by no means trustworthy, now become\r\n    of value. They may be supplemented from the full notices of\r\n    Tudor _spectacula_ in E. Hall, _The Union of Lancaster and\r\n    York_, 1548, ed. 1809, and from the various calendars of State\r\n    papers, of which J. S. Brewer and J. Gairdner, _Letters and\r\n    Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII_ (1862-1903), including the\r\n    _Revels Accounts_ and the _Kings Books of Payments_, is the\r\n    most important. Some useful documents are in W. C. Hazlitt,\r\n    _The English Drama and Stage_ (1869). The French facts are\r\n    given by L. Petit de Julleville, _Les Comédiens en France au\r\n    Moyen Âge_ (1889).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing section of this essay may fitly be introduced by a brief\r\nretrospect of the conclusions already arrived at. The investigation,\r\nhowever it may have lingered by the way, has not been altogether without\r\nits _logos_ or rational framework. The first book began with a study\r\nof the conditions under which the degenerate stage of the Roman Empire\r\nceased to exist. The most important of these were the indifference of\r\nthe barbarians and the direct hostility of the Church. A fairly clean\r\nsweep was made. Scarcely a thread of dramatic tradition is to be traced\r\namongst the many and diverse forms of entertainment provided by mediaeval\r\nminstrelsy. But the very existence of minstrelsy, itself a singular blend\r\nof Latin and barbaric elements, is a proof of the enduring desire of the\r\nwestern European peoples for something in the nature of _spectacula_.\r\nIn the strength of this the minstrels braved the ban of the Church, and\r\nfinally won their way to at least a partial measure of toleration from\r\ntheir hereditary foes. In the second book it was shown that the instinct\r\nfor _spectacula_ had its definitely dramatic side. The ludi of the\r\nfolk, based upon ancient observances of a forgotten natural religion,\r\nand surviving side by side with minstrelsy, broke out at point after\r\npoint into _mimesis_. Amongst the villages they developed into dramatic\r\nMay-games and dramatic sword-dances: in their _bourgeois_ forms they\r\noverran city and cathedral with the mimicries of the Feast of Fools and\r\nthe Boy Bishop; they gave birth to a special type of drama in the mask;\r\nand they further enriched Tudor revels with the characteristic figures\r\nof the domestic fool or jester and the lord of misrule. Upon the folk\r\n_ludi_, as upon the _spectacula_ of the minstrels, the Church looked\r\ndoubtfully. But the mimetic instinct was irresistible, and in the end it\r\nwas neither minstrels nor folk, but the Church itself, which did most for\r\nits satisfaction. The subject of the third book is a remarkable growth\r\nof drama within the heart of the ecclesiastical liturgy, which began in\r\nthe tenth century, and became, consciously or unconsciously, a powerful\r\ncounterpoise to the attraction of _ludi_ and _spectacula_. So popular,\r\nindeed, did it prove that it broke the bonds of ecclesiastical control;\r\nand about the thirteenth century a process of laicization set in, which\r\nculminated during the fourteenth in the great Corpus Christi cycles of\r\nthe municipal guilds. The subject-matter, however, remained religious to\r\nthe end, an end which, in spite of the marked critical attitude adopted\r\nby the austerer schools of churchmen, did not arrive until that attitude\r\nwas confirmed by successive waves of Lollard and Protestant sentiment.\r\nNor was the system substantially affected by certain innovations of the\r\nfifteenth century, a tendency to substitute mere spectacular pageantry\r\nfor the spoken drama, and a tendency to add to the visible presentment of\r\nthe scriptural history an allegorical exposition of theological and moral\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nIt is the object of the present book briefly to record the rise, also in\r\nthe fifteenth century, of new dramatic conditions which, after existing\r\nfor a while side by side with those of mediaevalism, were destined\r\nultimately to become a substitute for these and to lead up directly to\r\nthe magic stage of Shakespeare. The change to be sketched is primarily a\r\nsocial rather than a literary one. The drama which had already migrated\r\nfrom the church to the market-place, was to migrate still further, to\r\nthe banqueting-hall. And having passed from the hands of the clergy to\r\nthose of the folk, it was now to pass, after an interval of a thousand\r\nyears, not immediately but ultimately, into those of a professional class\r\nof actors. Simultaneously it was to put off its exclusively religious\r\ncharacter, and enter upon a new heritage of interests and methods,\r\nbeneath the revivifying breath of humanism.\r\n\r\nA characteristic note of the new phase is the rise of the term\r\n_interludium_ or ‘interlude.’ This we have already come across in the\r\ntitle of that fragmentary _Interludium de Clerico et Puella_ which alone\r\namongst English documents seemed to bear witness to a scanty dramatic\r\nelement in the repertory of minstrelsy[524]. The primary meaning of the\r\nname is a matter of some perplexity. The learned editors of the _New\r\nEnglish Dictionary_ define it as ‘a dramatic or mimic representation,\r\nusually of a light or humorous character, such as was commonly introduced\r\nbetween the acts of the long mystery-plays or moralities, or exhibited\r\nas part of an elaborate entertainment.’ Another recognized authority,\r\nDr. Ward, says[525]: ‘It seems to have been applied to plays performed\r\nby professional actors from the time of Edward IV onwards. Its origin\r\nis doubtless to be found in the fact that such plays were occasionally\r\nperformed in the intervals of banquets and entertainments, which of\r\ncourse would have been out of the question in the case of religious\r\nplays proper.’ I cannot say that I find either of these explanations at\r\nall satisfactory. In the first place, none of the limitations of sense\r\nwhich they suggest are really borne out by the history of the word. So\r\nfar as its rare use in the fourteenth century goes, it is not confined\r\nto professional plays and it does not exclude religious plays. The\r\n_Interludium de Clerico et Puella_ is, no doubt, a farce, and something\r\nof the same sort appears to be in the mind of Huchown, or whoever else\r\nwas the author of _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_, when he speaks of\r\nlaughter and song as a substitute for ‘enterludez’ at Christmas[526].\r\nBut on the other hand, Robert Mannyng of Brunne, at the very beginning\r\nof the century, classes ‘entyrludes’ with ‘somour games’ and other\r\nforbidden delights of the folk[527], while the Wyclifite author of\r\nthe _Tretise on Miriclis_ at its close, definitely uses ‘entirlodies’\r\nas a name for the religious plays which he is condemning[528]. In the\r\nfifteenth century, again, although ‘interlude’ is of course not one\r\nof the commonest terms for a miracle-play, yet I find it used for\r\nperformances probably of the miracle-play type at New Romney in 1426 and\r\nat Harling in 1452, while the jurats of the former place paid in 1463\r\nfor ‘the play of the interlude of our Lord’s Passion[529].’ The term,\r\nthen, appears to be equally applicable to every kind of drama known to\r\nthe Middle Ages. As to its philological derivation, both the _New English\r\nDictionary_ and Dr. Ward treat it as a _ludus_ performed in the intervals\r\nof (_inter_) something else, although they do not agree as to what that\r\nsomething else was. For the performance of farces ‘between the acts of\r\nthe long miracle-plays’ there is no English evidence whatever[530]. The\r\nfarcical episodes which find a place in the Towneley plays and elsewhere\r\nare in no way structurally differentiated from the rest of the text.\r\nThere are some French examples of combined performances of farces and\r\nmiracles, but they do not go far enough back to explain the origin of\r\nthe word[531]. A certain support is no doubt given to the theory of\r\nthe _New English Dictionary_ by the ‘mirry interludes’ inserted in Sir\r\nDavid Lyndsay’s morality _Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaits_, but, once\r\nmore, it is difficult to elucidate a term which appears at the beginning\r\nof the fourteenth century from an isolated use in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth. Dr. Ward’s hypothesis is perhaps rather more plausible. No\r\ndoubt plays were performed at court and elsewhere between the banquet and\r\nthe ‘void’ or cup of spiced drink which followed later in the evening,\r\nand possibly also between the courses of the banquet itself[532]. But\r\nthis fact would not differentiate dramatic _ludi_ from other forms of\r\nminstrelsy coming in the same intervals, and the fact that miracle-plays\r\nare called interludes, quite as early as anything else, remains to be\r\naccounted for. I am inclined myself to think that the force of _inter_ in\r\nthe combination has been misunderstood, and that an _interludium_ is not\r\na _ludus_ in the intervals of something else, but a _ludus_ carried on\r\nbetween (_inter_) two or more performers; in fact, a _ludus_ in dialogue.\r\nThe term would then apply primarily to any kind of dramatic performance\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nIn any case it is clear that while ‘interlude’ was only a subordinate\r\nname for plays of the miracle-type, it was the normal name,\r\nvaried chiefly by ‘play’ and ‘disguising,’ for plays given in the\r\nbanqueting-halls of the great[533]. These begin to claim attention\r\nduring the fifteenth century. Dr. Ward’s statement that religious plays\r\ncould not have been the subject of such performances does not bear the\r\ntest of comparison with the facts. A miracle of St. Clotilda was played\r\nbefore Henry the Sixth at Windsor Castle in 1429, a _Christi Descensus\r\nad Inferos_ before Henry the Seventh during dinner at Winchester in\r\n1486; nor is it probable that the play performed by the boys of Maxstoke\r\nPriory in the hall of Lord Clinton at Candlemas, 1430, was other than\r\nreligious in character[534]. The records of the miracle-plays themselves\r\nshow that they were often carried far from home. There was much coming\r\nand going amongst the villages and little towns round about Lydd and\r\nNew Romney from 1399 to 1508. One at least of the existing texts, that\r\nof the Croxton _Sacrament_, appears to be intended for the use of a\r\ntravelling troupe, and that such troupes showed their plays not only in\r\nmarket-places and on village greens but also in the houses of individual\r\npatrons, is suggested by entries of payments to players of this and that\r\nlocality in more than one _computus_[535]. Thus Maxstoke Priory, between\r\n1422 and 1461, entertained _lusores_[536] from Nuneaton, Coventry,\r\nDaventry, and Coleshill; while Henry the Seventh, between 1492 and\r\n1509, gave largess, either at court or abroad, to ‘pleyers’ from Essex,\r\nWimborne Minster, Wycombe, London, and Kingston. The accounts of the\r\nlast-named place record an ordinary parochial play in the very year of\r\nthe royal ‘almasse.’\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this practice of travelling must have brought the\r\nlocal players into rivalry with those hereditary gentlemen of the\r\nroad, the minstrels. Possibly they had something to do with provoking\r\nthat _querelosa insinuatio_ against the _rudes agricolae et artifices\r\ndiversarum misterarum_ which led to the formation of the royal guild\r\nof minstrels in 1469. If so, the measure does not seem to have been\r\nwholly successful in suppressing them. But the minstrels had a better\r\nmove to make. Their own profession had fallen, with the emergence of the\r\n_trouvère_ and the spread of printing, upon evil days. And here were the\r\nscanty remnants of their audiences being filched from them by unskilled\r\nrustics who had hit upon just the one form of literary entertainment\r\nwhich, unlike poetry and romance in general, could not dispense with\r\nthe living interpreter[537]. What could they do better than develop a\r\nneglected side of their own art and become players themselves? So there\r\nappear in the _computi_, side by side with the local _lusores_, others\r\nwhose methods and status are precisely those of minstrels[538]. The\r\ngenerosity of Henry the Sixth at the Christmas of 1427 is called forth\r\nequally by the _entreludes_ of the _jeweis de Abyndon_ and the _jeuues\r\net entreludes_ of _Jakke Travail et ses compaignons_. By 1464 ‘players\r\nin their enterludes’ were sufficiently recognized to be included with\r\nminstrels in the exceptions of the Act of Apparel[539]. Like other\r\nminstrels, the players put themselves under the protection of nobles and\r\npersons of honour. The earliest upon record are those of Henry Bourchier,\r\nearl of Essex, and those of Richard, duke of Gloucester, afterwards\r\nRichard the Third. Both companies were rewarded by Lord Howard in 1482.\r\nThe earls of Northumberland, Oxford, Derby, and Shrewsbury, and Lord\r\nArundel, all had their players before the end of the century[540]. The\r\nregulations of the _Northumberland Household Book_, as well as entries\r\nin many _computi_, show that by the reign of Henry the Eighth the\r\npractice was widespread[541]. Naturally it received a stimulus when a\r\nbody of players came to form a regular part of the royal household.\r\nWhether Richard the Third retained his company in his service during his\r\nbrief reign is not upon record. But Henry the Seventh had four _lusores\r\nregis, alias, in lingua Anglicana, les pleyars of the Kyngs enterluds_ at\r\nleast as early as 1494. These men received an annual fee of five marks\r\napiece, together with special rewards when they played before the king.\r\nWhen their services were not required at court, they took to the road,\r\njust as did the minstrels, _ioculator_, and _ursarius_ of the royal\r\nestablishment. In 1503 they were sent, under their leader John English,\r\nin the train of Margaret of Scotland to her wedding with James the Fourth\r\nat Edinburgh, and here they ‘did their devoir’ before the Scottish\r\ncourt[542]. Henry the Eighth increased their number to eight, and they\r\ncan be traced on the books of the royal household through the reigns of\r\nEdward the Sixth and Mary, and well into that of Elizabeth[543].\r\n\r\nThe new conditions under which plays were now given naturally reacted\r\nupon the structure of the plays themselves. The many scenes of the\r\nlong cyclical miracles, with their multitudinous performers, must be\r\nreplaced by something more easy of representation. The typical interlude\r\ndeals with a short episode in about a thousand lines, and could be\r\nhandled in the hour or so which the lord might reasonably be expected\r\nto spare from his horse and his hounds[544]. Economy in travelling and\r\nthe inconvenience of crowding the hall both went to put a limit on the\r\nnumber of actors. Four men and a boy, probably in apprenticeship to one\r\nof them, for the women’s parts, may be taken as a normal troupe. In many\r\nof the extant interludes the list of _dramatis personae_ is accompanied\r\nby an indication as to how, by the doubling of parts, the caste may be\r\nbrought within reasonable compass[545]. The simplest of scenic apparatus\r\nand a few boards on trestles for a stage had of course to suffice. But\r\nsome sort of a stage there probably was, as a rule, although doubtless\r\nthe players were prepared, if necessary, to perform, like masquers,\r\non the floor in front of the screen, or at best upon the dais where\r\nthe lord sat at meals[546]. The pleasure-loving monks of Durham seem\r\nas far back as 1465 to have built at their cell of Finchale a special\r\nplayer-chamber for the purposes of such entertainments[547]. Henry the\r\nEighth, too, in 1527 had a ‘banket-house’ or ‘place of plesyer,’ called\r\nthe ‘Long house,’ built in the tiltyard at Greenwich, and decorated by\r\nnone other than Hans Holbein[548]. But this was designed rather for a\r\nspecial type of disguising, half masque half interlude, and set out with\r\nthe elaborate pageants which the king loved, than for ordinary plays. A\r\nsimilar banqueting-house ‘like a theatre’ had been set up at Calais in\r\n1520, but unfortunately burnt down before it could be used[549]. Another\r\ncharacteristic of the interlude is the prayer for the sovereign and\r\nsometimes the estates of the realm with which it concludes, and which\r\noften helps to fix the date of representation of the extant texts[550].\r\n\r\nLike the minstrels, the interlude players found a welcome not only in\r\nthe halls of the great, but amongst the _bourgeois_ and the village\r\nfolk. In the towns they would give their first performance before the\r\nmunicipality in the guildhall and take a reward[551]. Then they would\r\nfind a profitable pitch in the courtyard of some old-fashioned inn, with\r\nits convenient range of outside galleries[552]. It is, however, rather\r\nsurprising to find that Exeter, like Paris itself[553], had its regular\r\ntheatre as early as 1348, more than two centuries before anything of\r\nthe kind is heard of in London. This fact emerges from two mandates\r\nof Bishop Grandisson; one, already quoted in the previous volume,\r\ndirected against the _secta_ or _ordo_, probably a _société joyeuse_, of\r\nBrothelyngham[554], the other inhibiting a satirical performance designed\r\nby the youth of the city, in disparagement of the trade and mystery of\r\nthe cloth-dressers. In both cases the ‘theatre’ of the city was to be\r\nthe locality of the revels[555]. Much later, in 1538, but still well in\r\nanticipation of London, the corporation of Yarmouth appear to have built\r\na ‘game-house’ upon the garden of the recently surrendered priory[556].\r\n\r\nIn the villages the players probably had to content themselves with\r\na stage upon the green; unless indeed they could make good a footing\r\nin the church. This they sometimes did by way of inheritance from the\r\nlocal actors of miracles. For while the great craft-cycles long remained\r\nunaffected by the professional competition and ultimately came to their\r\nend through quite different causes, it was otherwise in the smaller\r\nplaces. If the parson and the churchwardens wanted a miracle in honour\r\nof their patron saint and could readily hire the services of a body of\r\ntrained actors, they were not likely to put themselves to the trouble of\r\ndrilling bookless rustics in their parts. And so the companies got into\r\nthe churches for the purpose of playing religious interludes, but, if the\r\ndiatribes of Elizabethan Puritans may be trusted, remained there to play\r\nsecular ones[557]. The rulers of the Church condemned the abuse[558],\r\nbut it proved difficult to abolish, and even in 1602 the authorities of\r\nSyston in Leicestershire had to buy players off from performing in the\r\nchurch[559].\r\n\r\nEven where the old local plays survived they were probably more or less\r\nassimilated to the interlude type. It was certainly so with those written\r\nby John Bale and played at Kilkenny. It was probably so with the play of\r\n_Placidas_ or _St. Eustace_ given at Braintree in 1534, if, as is most\r\nlikely, it was written by Nicholas Udall, who was vicar of Braintree at\r\nthe time. And when we find the wardens of Bungay Holy Trinity in 1558\r\npaying fourpence for an ‘interlude and game-booke’ and two shillings for\r\nwriting out the parts, the conjecture seems obvious that what they had\r\ndone was to obtain a copy of one of the printed interludes which by that\r\ntime the London stationers had issued in some numbers. On the other hand\r\nthe example of the travelling companies sometimes stirred up the folk,\r\nwith the help, no doubt, of Holophernes the schoolmaster, to attempt\r\nperformances of secular as well as religious plays on their own account.\r\nThe rendering of _Pyramus and Thisbe_ by the mechanicals of Athens, which\r\nis Stratford-upon-Avon, is the classical instance. But in Shropshire the\r\nfolk are said to have gone on playing debased versions of _Dr. Faustus_\r\nand other Elizabethan masterpieces, upon out-of-door stages, until quite\r\nan incredibly late date[560].\r\n\r\nI return to the atmosphere of courts. It must not be supposed that, under\r\nthe early Tudors, the professional players had a monopoly of interludes.\r\nOn the contrary, throughout nearly the whole of the sixteenth century,\r\nit remained doubtful whether the future of the drama was to rest in\r\nprofessional or amateur hands. The question was not settled until the\r\ngenius of Marlowe and of Shakespeare came to the help of the players.\r\nUnder the pleasure-loving Henries accomplishment in the arts of social\r\ndiversion was as likely a road to preferment as another. Sir Thomas More\r\nwon a reputation as a page by his skill in improvising a scene[561].\r\nJohn Kite stepped almost straight from the boards to the bishopric of\r\nArmagh. His performances, not perhaps without some scandal to churchmen,\r\nwere given when he was subdean of the Chapel Royal[562]. This ancient\r\nestablishment, with its thirty-two gentlemen and its school of children,\r\nproved itself the most serious rival of the regular company. Both\r\ngentlemen and children, sometimes together and sometimes separately, took\r\npart in the performances, the records of which begin in 1506[563]. The\r\nrather exceptional nature of the repertory will be considered presently.\r\nFew noblemen, of course, kept a chapel on the scale of the royal one.\r\nBut that of the earl of Northumberland was of considerable size, and\r\nwas accustomed about 1523 to give, not only a Resurrection play at\r\nEaster and a Nativity play at Christmas, but also a play on the night\r\nof Shrove-Tuesday. The functionary to whom it looked for a supply of\r\ninterludes was the almoner[564].\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen of the Inns of Courts were always ready to follow in the\r\nwake of courtly fashion. Their interludes were famous and important in\r\nthe days of Elizabeth, but, although Lincoln’s Inn entertained external\r\n_lusores_ in 1494 and 1498[565], Gray’s Inn is the only one in which\r\namateur performances are recorded before 1556. A ‘disguising’ or ‘plaie’\r\nby one John Roo was shown here in 1526, and got the actors into trouble\r\nwith Wolsey, who found, or thought that he found, in it reflections\r\non his own administration[566]. All ‘comedies called enterludes’ were\r\nstopped by an order of the bench in 1550, except during times of solemn\r\nChristmas[567]. In 1556 an elaborate piece for performance by all the\r\nInns was in preparation by William Baldwin[568].\r\n\r\nThere were interludes, moreover, at universities and in schools. The\r\nearliest I have noted are at Magdalen College, Oxford, where they occur\r\npretty frequently from 1486 onwards. They were given in the hall at\r\nChristmas, and overlap in point of time the performances of the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_ in the chapel[569]. There was a play at Cardinal’s College in\r\n1530[570]. Nicholas Grimald’s _Christus Redivivus_ was given at Brasenose\r\nabout 1542. Possibly his _Archipropheta_ was similarly given about 1546\r\nat Christ Church, of which he had then become a member. Beyond these\r\nI do not know of any other Oxford representations before 1558. But in\r\n1512 the University granted one Edward Watson a degree in grammar on\r\ncondition of his composing a comedy[571]. At Cambridge the pioneer\r\ncollege was St. John’s, where the _Plutus_ of Aristophanes was given in\r\nGreek in 1536[572]. Christ’s College is noteworthy for a performance of\r\nthe antipapal _Pammachius_ in 1545[573], and also for a series of plays\r\nunder the management of one William Stevenson in 1550-3, amongst which it\r\nis exceedingly probable that _Gammer Gurton’s Needle_ was included[574].\r\nMost of these university plays were however, probably, in Latin. The\r\nElizabethan statutes of Trinity College[575] and Queens’ College[576]\r\nboth provide for plays, and in both cases the performances really date\r\nback to the reign of Henry VIII. At Trinity John Dee seems to have\r\nproduced the _Pax_ of Aristophanes, with an ingenious contrivance for\r\nthe flight of the Scarabaeus to Zeus, shortly upon his appointment as an\r\noriginal fellow in 1546[577].\r\n\r\nThe Westminster Latin play cannot be clearly shown to be\r\npre-Elizabethan[578], and the Westminster dramatic tradition is,\r\ntherefore, less old than that of either Eton or St. Paul’s. Professor\r\nHales has, indeed, made it seem plausible that Udall’s _Ralph Roister\r\nDoister_ dates from his Westminster (?1553-6) and not his Eton mastership\r\n(1534-41). But the Eton plays can be traced back to 1525-6[579], and\r\nwere a recognized institution when Malim wrote his _Consuetudinary_\r\nabout 1561[580]. In 1538 the Eton boys played, under Udall, before\r\nCromwell[581]. A decade earlier, in 1527, John Ritwise had brought the\r\nboys of Colet’s new foundation at St. Paul’s to court. They acted an\r\nanti-Lutheran play before Henry and probably also the _Menaechmi_ before\r\nWolsey. Certainly they acted the _Phormio_ before him in the following\r\nyear[582]. The dramatic history of this school is a little difficult\r\nto disentangle from that of its near neighbour, the song-school of St.\r\nPaul’s cathedral[583]. The song-school probably provided the children\r\nwhom Heywood brought before the princess Mary in 1538[584] and to court\r\nin 1553. But some doubt has been cast upon the _bona fides_ of the\r\naccount which Warton gives of further performances by them before the\r\nprincess Elizabeth at Hatfield in 1554[585]. Plays, either in English or\r\nin Latin, of which Bale preserves a list, were also acted in the private\r\nschool set up in 1538 by one Ralph Radclif in the surrendered Carmelite\r\nconvent of Hitchin[586].\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the non-professional dramatic activities of England,\r\noutside the miracle-plays, although of some importance in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, came late and hardly extended beyond courtly and scholastic\r\ncircles. There is nothing corresponding to the plentiful production\r\nof farces by amateur associations of every kind which characterized\r\nfifteenth-century France. Besides the scholars and the _Basoche_, which\r\ncorresponded roughly to the Inns of Court, but was infinitely more lively\r\nand fertile, there were the _Enfants sans Soucis_ in Paris, and in the\r\nprovince a host of _puys_ and _sociétés joyeuses_. All of these played\r\nboth morals and farces, particularly the latter, for which they claimed\r\na very free licence of satirical comment[587]. As a result, although\r\nsalaried _joueurs de personnages_ begin to make their appearance in the\r\naccount books of the nobles as early as 1392-3[588], the professional\r\nactors were unable to hold their own against the unequal competition, and\r\ndo not really become of importance until quite the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury[589]. In England it was otherwise. The early suppression of the\r\nFeast of Fools and the strict control kept over the Boy Bishop afforded\r\nno starting-point for _sociétés joyeuses_, while the late development\r\nof English as a literary language did not lend itself to the formation\r\nof _puys_. We hear indeed of satirical performances by the guild of\r\nBrothelyngham at Exeter in 1348, and again by the _filii civitatis_ in\r\n1352[590], but Bishop Grandisson apparently succeeded in checking this\r\ndevelopment which, so far as the information at present available goes,\r\ndoes not seem to have permanently established itself either at Exeter or\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nHUMANISM AND MEDIAEVALISM\r\n\r\n    [_Bibliographical Note._—The literary discussions and\r\n    collections of texts named in the bibliographical note to chap.\r\n    xxiii and the material on the annals of the stage in that to\r\n    chap. xxiv remain available.

A list of early Tudor interludes will be found\r\n    in Appendix X.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dramatic material upon which the interlude was able to draw had\r\nnaturally its points of relation to and of divergence from that of\r\nthe popular stage, whose last days it overlapped. It continued to\r\noccupy itself largely with the morality. The ‘moral interludes’ of\r\nthe early Tudor period are in fact distinguished with some difficulty\r\nfrom the popular moralities by their comparative brevity, and by\r\nindications of the _mise en scène_ as a ‘room’ or ‘hall’ rather than\r\nan open ‘place[591].’ The only clearly popular texts later than those\r\nof the fifteenth century, discussed in a previous chapter, are Sir\r\nDavid Lyndsay’s Scottish _Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis_, and the\r\n_Magnificence_, which alone survives of several plays from the prolific\r\npen of the ‘laureate’ poet, John Skelton. A somewhat intermediate type is\r\npresented by the _Nature_ of Cardinal Morton’s chaplain, Henry Medwall.\r\nThis was certainly intended for performance as an interlude, but it is\r\non the scale of the popular moralities, needing division into two parts\r\nto bring it within the limits of courtly patience; and like them it is\r\nsufficiently wide in its scope to embrace the whole moral problem of\r\nhumanity. The conditions of the interlude, however, enforced themselves,\r\nand the later morals have, as a rule, a more restricted theme. They make\r\ntheir selection from amongst the battalions of sins and virtues which\r\nwere wont to invade the stage together, and set themselves the task of\r\nexpounding the dangers of a particular temperament or the advantages of\r\na particular form of moral discipline. _Hickscorner_ shows man led into\r\nirreligion by imagination and freewill. _Youth_ concerns itself with\r\npride, lechery, and riot, the specific temptations of the young. _The\r\nNature of the Four Elements_ and John Redford’s somewhat later _Wit and\r\nScience_ preach the importance of devotion to study. The distinction\r\nbetween the episodic and the more comprehensive moralities was in the\r\nconsciousness of the writers themselves; and the older fashion did not\r\nwholly disappear. William Baldwin describes his play for the Inns of\r\nCourt in 1556 as ‘comprehending a discourse of the worlde[592]’; and\r\nmention is more than once made of an interesting piece called _The Cradle\r\nof Security_, which seems to have had a motive of death and the judgement\r\nakin to that found in _The Pride of Life_ and in _Everyman_[593].\r\n\r\nThe morality was not, perhaps, quite such an arid type of drama as might\r\nbe supposed, especially after the dramatists learnt, instead of leaving\r\nhumanity as a dry bone of contention between the good and evil powers, to\r\nadopt a biographic mode of treatment, and thus to introduce the interest\r\nof growth and development[594]. But by the sixteenth century allegory\r\nhad had its day, and the light-hearted court of Henry VIII and Katharine\r\nof Aragon might be excused some weariness at the constant presentation\r\nbefore it of argumentative abstractions which occasionally yielded\r\nnothing more entertaining than a personified _débat_[595]. Certainly it\r\nis upon record that Medwall’s moral of ‘the fyndyng of Troth,’ played\r\nat the Christmas of 1513, appeared to Henry so long, that he got up and\r\n‘departyd to hys chambre[596].’ The offenders on this occasion were\r\nEnglish and his company of household players. They seem to have been\r\nunwisely wedded to the old methods. They pursued the princess Margaret to\r\nScotland with a ‘Moralite’ in 1503, and in the reign of Edward VI they\r\nwere still playing the play of _Self-Love_[597]. Perhaps this explains\r\nwhy they make distinctly less show in the accounts of Tudor revels than\r\ndo their competitors of the Chapel. Unfortunately none of the pieces\r\ngiven by this latter body have been preserved. But, to judge by the\r\ndescriptions of Hall, many of them could only be called interludes by a\r\nsomewhat liberal extension of the sense of the term. There was perhaps\r\nsome slight allegorical or mythological framework of spoken dialogue. But\r\nthe real amusement lay in an abundance of singing, which of course the\r\nChapel was well qualified to provide, and of dancing, in which the guests\r\noften joined, and in an elaborately designed pageant, which was wheeled\r\ninto the hall and from which the performers descended. They were in fact\r\nmasques rather than dramas in the strict sense, and in connexion with the\r\norigin of the masque they have already been considered[598].\r\n\r\nThe popular stage, as has been said, had its farcical elements, but did\r\nnot, in England, arrive at any notable development of the farce. Nor\r\nis any marked influence of the overseas habit even now to be traced.\r\nThe name is not used in England, although it is in Scotland, where\r\nat the beginning of the sixteenth century the relations with France\r\nwere much closer[599]. Whether directly or indirectly through French\r\nchannels, the farce is perhaps the contribution of minstrelsy to the\r\nnascent interlude. That some dramatic tradition was handed down from\r\nthe _mimi_ of the Empire to the _mimi_ of the Middle Ages, although not\r\nsusceptible of demonstration, is exceedingly likely[600]. That solitary\r\nmediaeval survival, the _Interludium de Clerico et Puella_, hardly\r\ndeclares its origin. But the farce, in its free handling of contemporary\r\nlife, in the outspokenness, which often becomes indecency, of its\r\nlanguage, in its note of satire, especially towards the priest and other\r\ninstitutions deserving of reverence, is the exact counterpart of one\r\nof the most characteristic forms of minstrel literature, the _fabliau_.\r\nThese qualities are reproduced in the interludes of John Heywood, who,\r\nthough possibly an Oxford man, began life as a singer and player of\r\nthe virginals at court, and belonged therefore to the minstrel class.\r\nHe grew quite respectable, married into the family of Sir Thomas More\r\nand John Rastell the printer, and had for grandson John Donne. He was\r\nput in charge of the singing-school of St. Paul’s, the boys of which\r\nprobably performed his plays. Of the six extant, _Wit and Folly_ is a\r\nmere dialogue, and _Love_ a more elaborate disputation, although both are\r\npresented ‘in maner of an enterlude.’ But the others, _The Pardoner and\r\nthe Friar_, _The Four P’s_, _The Weather_, and _John, Tib and Sir John_\r\nare regular farces. And with them the farce makes good its footing in the\r\nEnglish drama.\r\n\r\nThose congeners of the French farce which took their origin from\r\nthe Feast of Fools, the _Sottie_ and the _Sermon joyeux_, are only\r\nrepresented in these islands by the Sermon of ‘Folie’ in Sir David\r\nLyndsay’s _Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis_[601]. But the ‘fool’ himself,\r\nas a dramatic character, is in Shakespeare’s and other Elizabethan\r\nplays, and it must now be pointed out that he is in some of the\r\nearliest Tudor interludes. Here he has the not altogether intelligible\r\nname of the ‘vice.’ A recent writer, Professor Cushman of the Nevada\r\nState University, has endeavoured to show that the vice came into\r\nthe interludes through the avenue of the moralities. Originally ‘an\r\nallegorical representation of human weaknesses and vices, in short\r\nthe summation of the Deadly Sins,’ he lost in course of time this\r\nserious quality, and ‘the term Vice came to be simply a synonym for\r\nbuffoon[602].’ This theory has no doubt the advantage of explaining the\r\nname. Unfortunately it proceeds by disregarding several plays in which\r\nthe vice does occur, and reading him into many where there is none[603].\r\n‘Vicious’ had his pageant in the Beverley _Paternoster_ play, and vices\r\nin the ordinary sense of the word are of course familiar personages in\r\nthe morals, which generally moreover have some one character who can\r\nbe regarded as the representative or the chief representative of human\r\nfrailty. But the vice is not found under that name in the text, list of\r\n_dramatis personae_, or stage directions of any popular morality or of\r\nany pre-Elizabethan moral interlude except the Marian _Respublica_. The\r\nmajority of plays in which he does occur are not morals, even of the\r\nmodified Elizabethan type; and although in those which are he generally\r\nplays a bad part, even this is not an invariable rule. In _The Tide\r\nTarrieth for No Man_, as in the tragedy of _Horestes_, he is Courage.\r\nMoreover, as a matter of fact, he comes into the interludes through the\r\navenue of the farce. The earliest vices, by some thirty years, are those\r\nof Heywood’s _Love_, in which he is ‘Neither Loving nor Loved,’ who\r\nmocks the other disputants, and plays a practical joke with fireworks\r\nupon them, and _The Weather_, in which he is ‘Merry Report,’ the jesting\r\nofficial of Jupiter. And in the later plays, even if he has some other\r\ndramatic function, he always adds to it that of a riotous buffoon.\r\nFrequently enough he has no other. It must be concluded then that,\r\nwhatever the name may mean—and irresponsible philology has made some\r\namazing attempts at explanation[604]—the character of the vice is derived\r\nfrom that of the domestic fool or jester. Oddly enough he is rarely\r\ncalled a fool, although the description of Medwall’s _Finding of Truth_\r\nmentions ‘the foolys part[605].’ But the Elizabethan writers speak\r\nof his long coat and lathen sword, common trappings of the domestic\r\nfool[606]. Whether he ever had a cockscomb, a bauble, or an eared hood is\r\nnot apparent. A vice seems to have been introduced into one or two of the\r\nlater miracle-plays[607]. At Bungay in 1566 he ‘made pastime’ before and\r\nafter the play, as Tarleton or Kempe were in time to do with their ‘jigs’\r\nupon the London boards. And probably this was his normal function on such\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nFrom the moral the interlude drew abstractions; from the farce social\r\ntypes. The possibility of vital drama lay in an advance to the\r\nportraiture of individualities. The natural way to attain to this was by\r\nthe introduction of historical, mythical, or romantic personages. The\r\nmiracle-play had, of course, afforded these; but there is little to show\r\nthat the miracle-play, during the first half of the sixteenth century,\r\nhad much influence on the interlude[608]. The local players brought it\r\nto court, but, for the present, it was _démodé_. It was, however, to\r\nhave its brief revival. The quarry of romantic narrative had hardly been\r\nopened by the Middle Ages. An old theme of Robert of Sicily, once used at\r\nLincoln, was now remembered at Chester. Robin Hood had yielded dramatic\r\nMay-games, and his revels were popular at Henry VIII’s court[609]. New\r\nmotives, however, now begin to assert themselves. Some at least of these\r\nwere suggested by the study of Chaucer. Ralph Radclif’s school plays at\r\nHitchin included one on _Griselda_ and one on _Meliboeus_[610]. Nicholas\r\nGrimald wrote one on _Troilus_, and another had been acted by the Chapel\r\nat court in 1516[611]. Radclif was also responsible for a _Titus and\r\nGisippus_, while the king’s players, shaking off their devotion to the\r\nmoral, prepared in 1552 ‘a play of _Aesop’s Crow_, wherein the most part\r\nof the actors were birds[612].’ An extant piece on ‘the beauty and good\r\nproperties of women’ and ‘their vices and evil conditions’ is really a\r\nversion through the Italian of the Spanish _Celestina_, one of the first\r\nof many English dramatic borrowings from South European sources.\r\n\r\nSo far I have written only of developments which were at least latent in\r\nmediaevalism. But the interlude had its rise in the very midst of the\r\ngreat intellectual and spiritual movement throughout Europe which is\r\nknown as humanism; and hardly any branch of human activities was destined\r\nto be more completely transformed by the new forces than the drama. The\r\nhistory of this transformation is not, however, a simple one. Between\r\nhumanism and mediaevalism there is no rigid barrier. As at all periods\r\nof transition, a constant action and reaction established themselves\r\nbetween the old and new order of ideas. Moreover, humanism itself held\r\nelements in solution that were not wholly reconcilable with each other.\r\nMany things, and perhaps particularly the drama, presented themselves in\r\nvery different lights, according as they were viewed from the literary or\r\nthe religious side of the great movement. Some brief indication of the\r\nin-and-out play of the forces of humanism as they affected the history\r\nof the interlude during the first half of the sixteenth century is,\r\ntherefore, desirable.\r\n\r\nThe chief of these forces is, of course, the influence of classical\r\ncomedy and tragedy. These, as vital forms of literature, did not long\r\nsurvive the fall of the theatres, with which, indeed, their connexion had\r\nlong been of the slightest. In the East, a certain tradition of Christian\r\nbook dramas begins with the anti-Gnostic dialogues of St. Methodius in\r\nthe fourth century and ends with the much disputed Χριστὸς Πάσχων in the\r\neleventh or twelfth[613]. It is the merest conjecture that some of these\r\nmay have been given some kind of representation in the churches[614].\r\nIn the West the _Aulularia_ of Plautus was rehandled under the title\r\nof _Querolus_ at the end of the fourth century, and possibly also the\r\n_Amphitruo_ under that of _Geta_[615]. In the fifth, Magnus, the father\r\nof Consentius, is said by Sidonius, as Shakespeare is said by Ben\r\nJonson, to have ‘outdone insolent Greece, or haughty Rome[616].’ Further\r\nthe production of plays cannot be traced. Soon afterwards most of the\r\nclassical dramatists pass into oblivion. A knowledge of Seneca or of\r\nPlautus, not to speak of the Greeks, is the rarest of things from the\r\ntenth century to the fourteenth. The marked exception is Terence who, as\r\nDr. Ward puts it, led ‘a charmed life in the darkest ages of learning.’\r\nThis he owed, doubtless, to his unrivalled gift of packing up the most\r\nimpeccable sentiments in the neatest of phrases. His vogue as a school\r\nauthor was early and enduring, and the whole of mediaevalism, a few of\r\nthe stricter moralists alone dissenting, hailed him as a master of the\r\nwisdom of life[617]. At the beginning of the eleventh century, Notker\r\nLabeo, a monk of St. Gall, writes that he has been invited to turn the\r\n_Andria_ into German[618]. Not long before, Hrotsvitha, a Benedictine nun\r\nof Gandersheim in Saxony, had taken Terence as her model for half a dozen\r\nplays in Latin prose, designed to glorify chastity and to celebrate the\r\nconstancy of the martyrs. The dramaturgy of Hrotsvitha appears to have\r\nbeen an isolated experiment and the merest literary exercise. Her plays\r\nabound in delicate situations, and are not likely to have been intended\r\neven for cloister representation[619]. Nor is there much evidence for\r\nany representation of the Terentian comedies themselves. A curious\r\nfragment known as _Terentius et Delusor_ contains a dialogue between the\r\n_vetus poeta_ and a _persona delusoris_ or mime. The nature of this is\r\nsomewhat enigmatic, but it certainly reads as if it might be a prologue\r\nor _parade_ written for a Terentian representation. In any case, it is\r\nwholly unparalleled[620]. In fact, although the Middle Ages continued to\r\nread Terence, the most extraordinary ideas prevailed as to how his dramas\r\nwere originally produced. Vague reminiscences of the pantomimic art of\r\nlater Rome led to the mistaken supposition that the poet himself, or a\r\n_recitator_, declaimed the text from a _pulpitum_ above the stage, while\r\nthe actors gesticulated voicelessly below[621]. By a further confusion\r\nthe name of Calliopius, a third- or fourth-century grammarian through\r\nwhose hands the text of Terence has passed, was taken for that of a\r\n_recitator_ contemporary with the poet, and the _Vita Oxoniensis_ goes\r\nso far as to describe him as a powerful and learned man, who read the\r\ncomedies aloud in the senate[622]. The same complete ignorance of things\r\nscenic declares itself in the notions attached to the terms _tragoedia_\r\nand _comoedia_, not only vulgarly, but in the formal definitions of\r\nlexicographers and encyclopaedists[623].\r\n\r\nThe characteristics which really differentiate the drama from other\r\nforms of literature, dialogue and scenic representation, drop out of\r\naccount, the latter entirely, the former very nearly so. Both tragedy\r\nand comedy are regarded as forms of narrative. Tragedy is narrative\r\nwhich concerns persons of high degree, is written in a lofty style,\r\nand beginning happily comes to a sad conclusion. Comedy, on the other\r\nhand, concerns itself with ordinary persons, uses humble and everyday\r\nlanguage, and resolves its complications in a fortunate ending[624].\r\nEven these distinctions are not all consistently maintained, and the sad\r\nor happy event becomes the only fixed and invariable criterion[625].\r\nThe origin of such conceptions is to be found partly in the common\r\nderived classical use of _tragoedia_ and _comoedia_ to describe tragic\r\nand comic events as well as the species of drama in which these are\r\nrespectively represented; partly in a misunderstanding of grammarians\r\nwho, assuming the dialogue and the representation, gave definitions\r\nof tragedy and comedy in relation to each other[626]; and partly in\r\nthe solecism of the fifth-century epic writer Dracontius, who seems\r\nto have called his _Orestes_ a tragedy, merely because it was from\r\ntragedies that the material he used was drawn[627]. The _comoedia_ and\r\n_tragoedia_ of the Latin writers, thus defined, was extended to all the\r\nvarieties of narrative, in the widest sense of the word. The epics of\r\nLucan and Statius, the elegies of Ovid, are _tragoediae_; the epistles\r\nof Ovid, the pastoral dialogues of Virgil, are _comoediae_; the satires\r\nof Horace, Persius, Juvenal, are one or the other, according to the\r\npoint of view[628]. It is curious that, with all this wide extension\r\nof the terms, they were not applied to the one form of mediaeval Latin\r\ncomposition which really had some analogy to the ancient drama; namely to\r\nthe liturgical plays out of which the vernacular mysteries grew. These\r\nmust have been written by learned writers: some of them were probably\r\nacted by schoolboys trained in Terence; and yet, if Hrosvitha, as she\r\nshould be, is put out of the reckoning, no inward or outward trace\r\nof the influence of classical tragedy or comedy can be found in any\r\none of them. In the manuscripts, they are called _officium_, _ordo_,\r\n_ludus_, _miraculum_, _repraesentatio_ and the like, but very rarely\r\n_comoedia_ or _tragoedia_, and never before 1204[629]. From the Latin\r\nthe mediaeval notions of tragedy and comedy were transferred to similar\r\ncompositions in the vernaculars. Dante’s _Divina Commedia_ is just a\r\nstory which begins in Hell and ends in Paradise[630]. Boccaccio[631],\r\nChaucer[632], and Lydgate[633] use precisely similar language. And, right\r\nup to the end of the sixteenth century, ‘tragedy’ continues to stand for\r\n‘tragical legend’ with the authors of the _Mirror for Magistrates_ and\r\ntheir numerous successors[634]. Long before this, of course, humanistic\r\nresearch, without destroying their mediaeval sense, had restored to\r\nthe wronged terms their proper connotation. There is a period during\r\nwhich it is a little difficult to say what, in certain instances,\r\nthey do mean. When Robert Bower, in 1447, speaks of _comoediae_ and\r\n_tragoediae_ on the theme of Robin Hood and Little John, it is a matter\r\nfor conjecture whether he is referring to dramatized May-games or merely\r\nto ballads[635]. Bale, in writing of his contemporaries, certainly\r\napplies the words to plays; but when he ascribes _tragoedias vulgares_\r\nto Robert Baston, a Carmelite friar of the time of Edward II, it is\r\nprobable that he is using, or quoting a record which used, an obsolescent\r\nterminology[636]. What the _comoediae_ of John Scogan, under Edward IV,\r\nmay have been, must remain quite doubtful[637].\r\n\r\nIt is in the early fourteenth century and in Italy that a renewed\r\ninterest in the Latin dramatists, other than Terence, can first be\r\ntraced. Seneca became the subject of a commentary by the English\r\nDominican Nicholas Treveth, and also attracted the attention of Lovato\r\nde’ Lovati and the scholarly circle which gathered round him at Padua.\r\nThe chief of these was Albertino Mussato, who about 1314 was moved\r\nby indignation at the intrigues of Can Grande of Verona to write his\r\n_Ecerinis_ on the fate of that Ezzelino who, some eighty years before,\r\nhad tyrannized over Padua. This first of the Senecan tragedies of\r\nthe Renascence stirred enthusiasm amongst the growing number of the\r\n_literati_. It was read aloud and Mussato was laureated before the\r\nassembled university. Two learned professors paid it the tribute of a\r\ncommentary. The example of Mussato was followed in the _Achilleis_ (1390)\r\nof Antonio de’ Loschi of Vicenza and the _Progne_ (†1428) of Gregorio\r\nCorraro of Mantua. Petrarch was familiar not only with Terence, but also\r\nwith Seneca and Plautus, and his _Philologia_, written before 1331 and\r\nthen suppressed, may claim to take rank with the _Ecerinis_ as the first\r\nRenascence comedy. It was modelled, says Boccaccio, upon Terence. A fresh\r\nimpulse was given to the study and imitation of Latin comedy in 1427\r\nby the discovery of twelve hitherto unknown Plautine plays, including\r\nthe _Menaechmi_ and the _Miles Gloriosus_, and various attempts were\r\nmade to complete the imperfect plays. In 1441 Leonardo Dati of Florence\r\nintroduced a motive from the _Trinummus_ into his, not comedy, but\r\ntragedy of _Hiempsal_[638].\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that during these early stages of humanism\r\nclassical models and neo-Latin imitations alike were merely read and not\r\nacted. There is no sign whatever that as yet the mediaeval misconception\r\nas to the nature of Roman scenic representation had come to an end. It\r\nwas certainly shared by Nicolas Treveth and probably by both Petrarch\r\nand Boccaccio[639]. It was not indeed in these regular dramas that the\r\nhabit of acting Latin first re-established itself, but in a mixed and\r\nfar less classical type of play. It is probable that in schools the\r\nexercise of reciting verse, and amongst other verse dialogue, had never\r\ndied out since the time of the Empire. In the fourth century the _Ludus\r\nSeptem Sapientum_ of the Bordeaux schoolmaster Ausonius, which consists\r\nof no more than a set of verses and a ‘_Plaudite!_’ for each sage, was\r\ndoubtless written for some such purpose[640]. Such also may have been the\r\ndestiny of the ‘elegiac’ and ‘epic’ comedies and tragedies of which a\r\nfair number were produced, from the eleventh century to the thirteenth.\r\nThese are comedies and tragedies, primarily, in the mediaeval sense.\r\nThey are narrative poems in form. But in all of them a good deal of\r\ndialogue is introduced, and in some there is hardly anything else. Their\r\nsubject-matter is derived partly from Terence and partly from the stock\r\nof motives common to all forms of mediaeval light literature. Their\r\nmost careful student, Dr. Cloetta, suggests that they were intended for\r\na half-dramatic declamation by minstrels. This may sometimes have been\r\nthe case, but the capacity and the audience of the minstrels for Latin\r\nwere alike limited, and I do not see why at any rate the more edifying\r\nof them may not have been school pieces[641]. By the fifteenth century\r\nit will be remembered, students, who had long been in the habit of\r\nperforming miracle-plays, had also taken to producing farces, morals,\r\nand those miscellaneous comic and satiric pieces which had their origin\r\nin the folk-festivals. Many of these were in the vernaculars; but it\r\nis difficult to avoid classing with them a group of Latin dialogues\r\nand loosely constructed comedies, written in Terentian metres and\r\npresenting a curious amalgam of classical and mediaeval themes. Of\r\nhardly any of these can it be said positively that they were intended to\r\nbe acted. This is, however, not unlikely in the case of the anonymous\r\n_Columpnarium_, which goes back to the fourteenth century. Pavia probably\r\nsaw a performance of Ugolini Pisani’s _Confabulatio coquinaria_ (1435),\r\nwhich has all the characteristics of a carnival drollery, and certainly\r\nof Ranzio Mercurino’s _De Falso Hypocrita_, which is stated in the\r\nmanuscript to have been ‘_acta_’ there on April 15, 1437. The _Admiranda_\r\nof Alberto Carrara was similarly ‘_acta_’ at Padua about 1456. The exact\r\nway in which these pieces and others like them were performed must remain\r\ndoubtful. Acting in the strict sense can only be distinctly asserted of\r\nFrancesco Ariosto’s dialogue of _Isis_ which was given ‘_per personatos_’\r\nat the Ferrara carnival of 1444[642].\r\n\r\nAll this pseudo-classic comedy was looked upon with scorn by the purists\r\nof humanism. But it made its way over the Alps and had a considerable\r\nvogue in Germany. In France it found an exponent in Jean Tissier de\r\nRavisy (Ravisius Textor), professor of rhetoric in the College of Navarre\r\nat Paris, and afterwards rector of the Paris University, who wrote, in\r\ngood enough Latin, but wholly in the mediaeval manner, a large number\r\nof morals, farces, and dialogues for representation by his pupils[643].\r\nTwo at least of these were turned into English interludes. The classical\r\nelement predominates in the pseudo-Homeric _Thersites_, the production\r\nof which can be fixed to between October 12 and 24, 1537; the mediaeval\r\nin Thomas Ingelend’s _The Disobedient Child_, which belongs to the very\r\nbeginning of the reign of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless the study of Vitruvius which awakened the humanists to\r\nthe fact that their beloved comedies had after all been acted after very\r\nmuch the fashion so long familiar in farces and miracle-plays. Exactly\r\nwhen the knowledge came is not clear. Polydore Vergil is still ignorant,\r\nand even Erasmus, at the date of the _Adagia_, uncertain. Alberti put a\r\n_theatrum_ in the palace built on the Vatican for Nicholas V about 1452,\r\nbut there is no record of its use for dramatic performances at that\r\ntime, and the immediate successors of Nicholas did not love humanism.\r\nSuch performances seem to have been first undertaken by the pupils of a\r\nRoman professor, Pomponius Laetus. Amongst these was Inghirami, who was\r\nprotagonist in revivals of the _Asinaria_ of Plautus and the _Phaedra_\r\nof Seneca. These took place about 1485. Several other representations\r\nboth of classical plays and of neo-Latin imitations occurred in Italy\r\nbefore the end of the century; and the practice spread to other countries\r\naffected by the humanist wave, soon establishing itself as part of the\r\nregular sixteenth-century scheme of education. By this time, of course,\r\nGreek as well as Latin dramatic models were available. The Latin\r\ntranslation of the _Plutus_ of Aristophanes by Leonardo Bruni (†1427)\r\nfound several successors, and the play was acted at Zwickau in 1521. The\r\nstudy of Sophocles and Euripides began with Francesco Filelfo (†1481),\r\nbut no representations of these authors are mentioned[644].\r\n\r\nThe outburst of dramatic activity in English schools and universities\r\nduring the first half of the sixteenth century has already been noted.\r\nWolsey may claim credit for an early encouragement of classical comedy in\r\nvirtue of the performances of the _Menaechmi_ and the _Phormio_ given in\r\nhis house by the boys of St. Paul’s in 1527 and 1528[645]. The master of\r\nSt. Paul’s from 1522 to 1531 was John Ritwise, who himself wrote a Latin\r\nplay of _Dido_, which also appears to have been acted before Wolsey[646].\r\nThe _Plutus_ was given at St. John’s College, Cambridge, in 1536; the\r\n_Pax_ at Trinity about a decade later[647]. A long series of English\r\ntranslations of classical plays begins with one of the _Andria_ printed,\r\npossibly by John Rastell, under the title of _Terens in Englysh_[648].\r\n\r\nA more important matter is the influence exercised by classical models\r\nupon the vernacular interludes. This naturally showed itself in school\r\ndramas, and only gradually filtered down to the professional players.\r\nTwo plays compete for the honour of ranking as ‘the first regular\r\nEnglish comedy,’ a term which is misleading, as it implies a far more\r\ncomplete break with the past than is to be discerned in either of them.\r\nOne is Nicholas Udall’s _Ralph Roister Doister_, the performance of\r\nwhich can be dated with some confidence in 1553, by which time its\r\nauthor may already have been head master of Westminster; the other\r\nis _Gammer Gurton’s Needle_, which was put on the stage at Christ’s\r\nCollege, Cambridge, has been ascribed to John Still, afterwards bishop\r\nof Bath and Wells, and to John Bridges, afterwards bishop of Oxford, but\r\nis more probably the work of one William Stevenson, who was certainly\r\nsuperintending plays at Christ’s College in 1550-3. Both plays adopt the\r\nclassical arrangement by acts and scenes. But of the two _Gammer Gurton’s\r\nNeedle_ is far closer to the mediaeval farce in its choice and treatment\r\nof subject. _Ralph Roister Doister_, although by no means devoid of\r\nmediaeval elements, is in the main an adaptation of the _Miles Gloriosus_\r\nof Plautus. A slighter and rather later piece of work, _Jack Juggler_,\r\nwas also intended for performance by schoolboys, and is based upon the\r\n_Amphitruo_. The earliest ‘regular English tragedy’ on Senecan lines,\r\nor at least the earliest which oblivion has spared, is the _Gorboduc_\r\nor _Ferrex and Porrex_ of 1561. This falls outside the strict scope of\r\nthis chapter. But a fragment of a play from the press of John Rastell\r\n(1516-33) which introduces ‘Lucres’ and Publius Cornelius, suggests that,\r\nhere as elsewhere, the Elizabethan writers were merely resuming the\r\nhistory of the earlier English Renascence, which religious and political\r\ndisturbances had so wofully interrupted.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of Henry VIII’s reign, the course of the developing\r\ninterlude was further diverted by a fresh wave of humanist influence.\r\nThis came from the wing of the movement which had occupied itself, not\r\nonly with erudition, but also with the spiritual stirrings that issued\r\nin the Reformation. It must be borne in mind that the attitude of mere\r\nnegation which the English Puritans, no doubt with their justification\r\nin ‘antiquity,’ came to adopt towards the stage, was by no means\r\ncharacteristic of the earlier Protestantism. The Lutheran reformers were\r\nhumanists as well as theologians, and it was natural to them to shape\r\na literary weapon to their own purposes, rather than to cast it aside\r\nas unfit for furbishing. About 1530 a new school of neo-Latin drama\r\narose in Holland, which stood in much closer relations to mediaevalism\r\nthan that which had had its origin in Italy. It aimed at applying the\r\nstructure and the style of Terence to an edifying subject-matter drawn\r\nfrom the tradition of the religious drama. The English _Everyman_ belongs\r\nto a group of related plays, both in Latin and in the vernaculars, on\r\nits moral theme. The _Acolastus_ (1530, acted 1529) of William Gnaphaeus\r\nand the _Asotus_ (1537, written †1507) of George Macropedius began a\r\ncycle of ‘Prodigal Son’ plays which had many branches. The movement\r\nbegan uncontroversially, but developed Protestant tendencies. It spread\r\nto Basle, where Sixt Birck, who called himself Xystus Betuleius, wrote\r\na _Susanna_ (1537), an _Eva_ (1539), a _Judith_ (1540), and to France,\r\nwhere the Scotchman George Buchanan added to the ‘Christian Terence’\r\na ‘Christian Seneca’ in the _Jephthes_ (1554) and _Baptistes_ (1564)\r\nperformed, between 1540 and 1543, by his students at Bordeaux. In these,\r\nwhich are but a few out of many similar plays produced at this period,\r\nthe humanists drew in the main upon such scriptural subjects, many of\r\nthem apocryphal or parabolic, as were calculated, while no doubt making\r\nfor edification, at the same time to afford scope for a free portrayal of\r\nhuman life. This on the whole, in spite of the treatment of such episodes\r\nas the Magdalen _in gaudio_, was a departure from the normal mediaeval\r\nusage[649].\r\n\r\nA new note, of acute and even violent controversy, was introduced\r\ninto the Protestant drama by the fiery heretic, Thomas Kirchmayer, or\r\nNaogeorgos. Kirchmayer wrote several plays, but the most important from\r\nthe present point of view is that of _Pammachius_ (1538), written during\r\nhis pastorate of Sulza in Thuringia before his extreme views had led,\r\nnot merely to exile from the Empire, but also to a quarrel with Luther.\r\nThe _Pammachius_ goes back to one of the most interesting, although of\r\ncourse not one of the most usual, themes of mediaeval drama, that of\r\nAntichrist; and it will readily be conceived that, for Kirchmayer, the\r\nAntichrist is none other than the Pope. It is interesting to observe\r\nthat the play was dedicated to Archbishop Cranmer, whose reforming\r\n_Articles_ of 1536 had roused the expectations of Protestant Germany. It\r\nwas translated into English by John Bale, and was certainly not without\r\ninfluence in this country[650].\r\n\r\nBoth the merely edifying and the controversial type of Lutheran drama,\r\nindeed, found its English representatives. To the former belong the\r\n_Christus Redivivus_ (1543) and the _Archipropheta_ (1548) of the Oxford\r\nlecturer, Nicholas Grimald, one of which deals, somewhat exceptionally\r\nat this period, with the Resurrection, the other with John the Baptist.\r\nThe _Absalon_ of Thomas Watson, the _Jephthes_ of John Christopherson\r\n(1546)[651], and the _Sodom_, _Jonah_, _Judith_, _Job_, _Susanna_,\r\nand _Lazarus and Dives_ of Ralph Radclif (1546-56)[652], can only\r\nconjecturally be put in this class; and Nicholas Udall, who wrote an\r\n_Ezechias_ in English, certainly did not commit himself irrecoverably in\r\nthe eyes of good Catholics. John Palsgrave’s _Ecphrasis_ or paraphrase of\r\n_Acolastus_ (1540) is supplied with grammatical notes, and is conceived\r\nwholly in the academic interest. On the other hand controversy is\r\nsuggested in the titles of Radclif’s _De Iohannis Hussi Damnatione_, and\r\nof the _De Meretrice Babylonica_ ascribed by Bale to Edward VI[653],\r\nand is undeniably present in the _Christus Triumphans_ (1551) of John\r\nFoxe, the martyrologist. This, like _Pammachius_, to which it owes much,\r\nbelongs to the Antichrist cycle.\r\n\r\nNor was controversy confined to the learned language. As Protestantism,\r\ncoquetted with by Henry VIII, and encouraged by Cromwell, became\r\ngradually vocal in England and awakened an equally resonant reply, the\r\nvernacular drama, like every other form of literary expression, was swept\r\ninto the war of creeds. This phase, dominating even the professional\r\nplayers, endured through the reigns of Edward VI and Mary, and still\r\ncolours the early Elizabethan interludes. Its beginnings were independent\r\nof the Lutheran influences that so profoundly affected its progress. The\r\nmorality already contained within itself that tendency to criticism which\r\nwas perhaps the easiest way to correct its insipidity. Historically it\r\nwas politics rather than religion with which the interlude first claimed\r\nto interfere. The story begins, harmlessly enough, at court, with an\r\nallegorical ‘disguising’ during the visit of the Emperor Charles V to\r\nLondon in 1523, in which the French king, typified by an unruly horse,\r\nwas tamed by Amitie, who stood for the alliance between Charles and\r\nHenry[654]. In 1526 John Roo’s morality, played at Gray’s Inn, of ‘Lord\r\nGovernaunce’ and ‘Lady Publike-Wele’ wrung Wolsey’s withers, although as\r\na matter of fact it was twenty years old[655]. Religion was first touched\r\nin 1527 in a piece of which one would gladly know more. It was played, as\r\nit seems, in Latin and French by the St. Paul’s boys under John Ritwise,\r\nbefore ambassadors from France. The subject was the captivity of the\r\nPope, and amongst the singular medley of characters named are found\r\n‘the herretyke, Lewtar’ and ‘Lewtar’s wyfe, like a frowe of Spyers in\r\nAlmayn[656].’ This was, no doubt, all in the interests of orthodoxy; and\r\na similar tone may be assumed in the comedies acted before Wolsey in the\r\nfollowing year on the release of the Pope[657]. But much water passed\r\nunder the mill in the next few years, and in 1533 there was a comedy\r\nat court ‘to the no little defamation of certain cardinals[658].’ In\r\nthe same year, however, a proclamation forbade ‘playing of enterludes’\r\n‘concerning doctrines in matters now in question and controversie[659].’\r\nThis is a kind of regulation which it is easier to make than to enforce.\r\nIts effect, if it had any, was not of long duration. In 1537 much offence\r\nwas given to Bishop Gardiner, the Chancellor of Cambridge University, by\r\nthe performance amongst the youth of Christ’s College of a ‘tragedie,’\r\npart at least of which was ‘soo pestiferous as were intolerable.’ This\r\n‘tragedie’ was none other than the redoubtable _Pammachius_ itself[660].\r\nIn the same year, strict orders were issued to stay games and unlawful\r\nassemblies in Suffolk, on account of a ‘seditious May-game’ which was\r\n‘of a king, how he should rule his realm,’ and in which ‘one played\r\nHusbandry, and said many things against gentlemen more than was in the\r\nbook of the play[661].’ These were exceptional cases. Both the students\r\nof Christ’s and the Suffolk rustics had in their various ways overstepped\r\nthe permitted mark. Certainly Henry was not going to have kingship\r\ncalled in question on a village green. But it is notorious that, in\r\nmatters of religion, he secretly encouraged many obstinate questionings\r\nwhich he openly condemned. And there is evidence that Cromwell at least\r\nfound the interlude a very convenient instrument for the encouragement\r\nof Protestantism. Bale tells us that he himself won the minister’s\r\nfavour _ob editas comedias_[662]; and there is extant amongst his\r\npapers a singular letter of this same year 1537, from Thomas Wylley,\r\nthe vicar of Yoxford in Suffolk, in which he calls attention to three\r\nplays he has written, and asks that he may have ‘fre lyberty to preche\r\nthe trewthe[663].’ Cranmer, too, seems to have been in sympathy with\r\nCromwell’s policy, for in 1539 there was an enterlude at his house which\r\na Protestant described as ‘one of the best matiers that ever he sawe\r\ntowching King John,’ and which may quite possibly have been John Bale’s\r\nfamous play[664].\r\n\r\nThe position was altered after 1540, when Cromwell had fallen and the\r\npendulum of Henry’s conscience had swung back to orthodoxy. Foxe records\r\nhow under the _Act Abolishing Diversity in Opinions_ (1539), known as\r\nthe _Act of the Six Articles_, one Spencer, an ex-priest who had become\r\nan interlude-player, was burned at Salisbury for ‘matter concerning\r\nthe sacrament of the altar’; and how, in London, one Shermons, keeper\r\nof the Carpenters’ Hall in Shoreditch, ‘was presented for procuring an\r\ninterlude to be openly played, wherein priests were railed on and called\r\nknaves[665].’ But the stage was by now growing difficult to silence. In\r\n1542 the bishops petitioned the king to correct the acting of plays ‘to\r\nthe contempt of God’s Word[666]’; and in 1543 their desire was met by\r\nthe _Act for the Advauncement of true Religion and for the Abolishment of\r\nthe Contrary_, which permitted of ‘plays and enterludes for the rebukyng\r\nand reproching of vices and the setting forth of vertue’; but forbade\r\nsuch as meddled with ‘interpretacions of scripture, contrary to the\r\ndoctryne set forth or to be set forth by the kynges maiestie[667].’ This\r\nled to a vigorous protest from John Bale, writing under the pseudonym of\r\nHenry Stalbridge, in his _Epistel Exhortatorye of an Inglyshe Christian_.\r\nIts repeal was one of the first measures passed under Edward VI[668].\r\n\r\nLord Oxford’s men were playing in Southwark at the very hour of the\r\ndirge for Henry in the church of St. Saviour’s[669]. Almost immediately\r\n‘the Poope in play’ and ‘prests in play’ make their appearance once\r\nmore[670]. Edward himself wrote his comedy _De Meretrice Babylonica_.\r\nIn 1551 the English comedies ‘in demonstration of contempt for the\r\nPope’ were reported by the Venetian ambassador to his government[671].\r\nBut the players were not to have quite a free hand. It was now the\r\nCatholic interludes that needed suppression. A proclamation of August\r\n6, 1549, inhibited performances until the following November in view of\r\nsome ‘tendyng to sedicion[672].’ The _Act of Uniformity_ of the same\r\nyear forbade interludes ‘depraving and despising’ the _Book of Common\r\nPrayer_[673]. A more effective measure came later in a proclamation of\r\n1551, requiring either for the printing or the acting of plays a licence\r\nby the king or the privy council[674]. Mary, at whose own marriage\r\nwith Philip in 1554 there were Catholic interludes and pageants[675],\r\nissued a similar regulation in 1553, though naturally with a different\r\nintention[676]. But this was not wholly effectual, and further orders\r\nand much vigilance by the Privy Council in the oversight of players were\r\nrequired in the course of the reign[677].\r\n\r\nOnly a few texts from this long period of controversial drama have\r\ncome down to us. On the Catholic side there is but one, the play\r\nof _Respublica_ (1553). In this, and in the Protestant fragment of\r\n_Somebody, Avarice and Minister_, the ruling literary influence is that\r\nof Lyndsay’s _Satyre of the Thre Estaitis_. Of the remaining Protestant\r\nplays, _Nice Wanton_ (1560) and Thomas Ingelend’s _The Disobedient Child_\r\n(n.d.) derive from the Dutch school of Latin drama and its offshoots.\r\n_Nice Wanton_ is an adaptation of the _Rebelles_ (1535) of Macropedius.\r\n_The Disobedient Child_ has its relations, not only to the play of\r\nRavisius Textor already mentioned, but also to the _Studentes_ (1549)\r\nof Christopher Stymmelius. More distinctly combative in tendency is the\r\n_Lusty Juventus_ (n.d.) of R. Wever, who may be reckoned as a disciple\r\nof John Bale. The activity of Bale himself can be somewhat obscurely\r\ndiscerned as the strongest impelling force on the Protestant side. He\r\nhad his debts both to Lyndsay and to Kirchmayer, whose _Pammachius_, if\r\nnot his other plays, he translated. But he is very largely original,\r\nand he is set apart from the other great figures of the Lutheran drama\r\nby the fact that all his plays were written _in idiomate materno_.\r\nMoreover, though not without classical elements, they were probably\r\nintended for popular performance, and approach more closely to the\r\nmediaeval structure than to that of the contemporary interlude. In his\r\n_Scriptores_ he enumerates, under twenty-two titles, some forty-six of\r\nthem. The five extant ones were probably all ‘compiled’ about 1538 while\r\nhe was vicar of Thorndon in Suffolk. But some of them were acted at the\r\nmarket-cross of Kilkenny in 1553, and the others show signs of revision\r\nunder Edward VI or even Elizabeth. In _God’s Promises_, _John Baptist_,\r\nand _The Temptation_, Bale was simply adapting and Protestantizing the\r\nmiracle-play. The first is practically a _Prophetae_, and they are all\r\n‘actes,’ or as the Middle Ages would have said ‘processes’ or ‘pageants,’\r\nfrom a scriptural cycle. Of similar character were probably a series of\r\neleven plays extending from Christ in the Temple to the Resurrection.\r\nA _Vita D. Joannis Baptistae_ in fourteen _libri_ perhaps treated this\r\nfavourite sixteenth-century theme in freer style. The polemics are more\r\nmarked in _Three Laws_, which is a morality; and in _King John_, which is\r\na morality varied by the introduction of the king himself as a champion\r\nagainst the Pope and of certain other historical figures. It thus marks\r\nan important step in the advance of the drama towards the treatment of\r\nindividualities. With the _Three Laws_ and _King John_ may be grouped\r\nanother set of lost plays whose Latinized titles point unmistakably to\r\ncontroversy. An _Amoris Imago_ might be merely edifying; but it would be\r\ndifficult to avoid meddling in matters of doctrine with such themes to\r\nhandle as _De Sectis Papisticis_, _Erga Momos et Zoilos_, _Perditiones\r\nPapistarum_, _Contra Adulterantes Dei Verbum_, _De Imposturis Thomae\r\nBecketi_. A pair of plays _Super utroque Regis Coniugio_, must have been,\r\nif they were ever acted, a climax of audacity even for John Bale.\r\n\r\nWhat then, in sum, was the heritage which the early Elizabethan writers\r\nand players of interludes received from their immediate predecessors? For\r\nthe writers there were the stimulus of classical method and a widened\r\nrange both of intention and of material. Their claim was established\r\nto dispute, to edify, or merely to amuse. They stood on the verge\r\nof more than one field of enterprise which had been barely entered\r\nupon and justly appeared inexhaustible. ‘Tragedy, comedy, history,\r\npastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,\r\ntragical-comical-historical-pastoral’; they possessed at least the keys\r\nto them all. Their own work is a heterogeneous welter of all the dramatic\r\nelements of the past and the future. Belated morals and miracle-plays\r\njostle with adaptations of Seneca and Plautus. The _dramatis personae_\r\nof a single play will afford the abstractions of the allegory and the\r\ntypes of the farce side by side with real living individualities; and the\r\nlatter are drawn indifferently from contemporary society, from romance,\r\nfrom classical and from national history. These are precisely the dry\r\nbones which one day, beneath the breath of genius, should spring up into\r\nthe wanton life of the Shakespearean drama. The players had made good\r\ntheir footing both in courts and amongst the folk. But their meddlings\r\nwith controversy had brought upon them the hand of authority, which was\r\nnot to be lightly shaken off. Elizabeth, like her brother, signalized the\r\nopening of her reign by a temporary inhibition of plays[678]; and her\r\nprivy council assumed a jurisdiction, by no means nominal, over things\r\ntheatrical. In their censorship they had the assistance of the bishop\r\nof London, as ‘ordinary.’ The lesser companies may have suffered from\r\nthe statute of 1572 which confined the privilege of maintaining either\r\nminstrels or players of interludes to barons and personages of higher\r\ndegree[679]. But the greater ones which had succeeded in establishing\r\nthemselves in London, grew and flourished. They lived down the\r\ncompetition of the amateurs which during the greater part of the century\r\nthreatened to become dangerous, by their profitable system of double\r\nperformances, at court and in the inn yards. Thus they secured the future\r\nof the drama by making it economically independent; and the copestone\r\nof their edifice was the building of the permanent theatres. But for\r\ncourtesy and a legal fiction, they were vagabonds and liable to whipping:\r\nyet the time was at hand when one player was to claim coat armour and\r\nentertain preachers to sack and supper at New Place, while another was to\r\nmarry the daughter of a dean and to endow an irony for all time in the\r\nsplendid College of God’s Gift at Dulwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUNUS VOLUPTATUM\r\n\r\n    [The _tribunus voluptatum_ was a municipal officer of the later\r\n    Empire charged with the superintendence of the _spectacula_. He\r\n    seems to have been appointed for life by the Emperor, and to\r\n    have taken over functions formerly discharged by the praetors\r\n    and quaestors. Mommsen, _Ostgothische Studien_ (_Neues Archiv_,\r\n    xiv. 495), says that he first appears in the fifth century.\r\n    Possibly, therefore, Suetonius, _Tiberius_, 42, ‘novum denique\r\n    officium instituit a voluptatibus, praeposito equite R. T.\r\n    Caesonio Prisco’ refers to some other post. A _titulus_, ‘de\r\n    officio tribuni voluptatū qd a temelicis et scenariis,’ which\r\n    should be _C. Th._ i. 19, is missing from the text. _C. Th._\r\n    xv. 7, 13 (413), is addressed to the _tribunus voluptatum_ of\r\n    Carthage. The office was maintained in Italy under Theodoric\r\n    (493-526). The _formula_ of appointment here given is preserved\r\n    by Cassiodorus, _Variae_, vii. 10; cf. _Var._ vi. 19 ‘cum\r\n    lascivae voluptates recipiant tribunum.’ The Senate is informed\r\n    by _Var._ i. 43 (†509) of the promotion of Artemidorus, who\r\n    had held the office, to be _praefectus urbanus_. The _tribunus\r\n    voluptatum_ of Rome is referred to in two inscriptions of\r\n    522 and 526 (Rossi, _Inscr. Christ._ i. Nos. 989, 1005). One\r\n    Bacauda is appointed _tribunus voluptatum_ in Milan by _Var._\r\n    v. 25 (523-6).

L._ cxcix, 406),\r\nsays, Satius enim fuerat otiari quam turpiter occupari. Hinc mimi,\r\nsalii vel saliares, balatrones, aemiliani, gladiatores, palaestritae,\r\ngignadii, praestigiatores, malefici quoque multi, et tota ioculatorum\r\nscena procedit.’ The specific terms belong to John of Salisbury’s\r\nclassical learning rather than to contemporary use; but his generic\r\n_ioculator_ is the normal mediaeval Latin term for the minstrel in the\r\nwidest sense. Classically the word, like its synonym _iocularis_, is an\r\nadjective, ‘given to ioca,’ ‘merry.’ Thus Cicero, _ad Att_. iv. 16. 3\r\n‘huic ioculatorem senem illum interesse sane nolui.’ Similarly Firmicus\r\nMaternus (fourth century), _Mathesis_, viii. 22 ‘histriones faciat,\r\npantomimos, ac scaenicos ioculatores,’ and 4 _Conc. Carthag._ (398), c.\r\n60 (_C. I. C. Decr. Gratiani_, i. 46. 6) ‘clericum scurrilem et verbis\r\nturpibus ioculatorem ab officio retrahendum censemus.’ Here the technical\r\nmeaning is approached, which Gautier, ii. 12, declares to be complete\r\nin Salvian (fifth century), _de gubernatione Dei_. I cannot, however,\r\nfind the word in Salvian, though I do find _iugulator_, ‘cut-throat.’\r\nI have not come across _ioculator_ as a noun before the eighth century\r\n(vol. i. p. 37), but thenceforward it is widely used for minstrels\r\nof both the _scôp_ and the _mimus_ type. A rarer form is _iocista_.\r\n_Ioculator_ gives rise to the equally wide French term _jouglere_,\r\n_jougleur_, which seems to merge with the doublet _jogeler_, _jougler_,\r\nfrom _iocularis_. Similarly _ioca_ becomes _jeu_, the equivalent of\r\nthe classical and mediaeval Latin _ludus_, also in the widest sense.\r\nIn Provençal _ioculator_ becomes _joglar_, in English _jugelour_,\r\n_jugelere_, _jogeler_, &c. Thus _S. Eng. Leg._ i. 271 (†1290) ‘Is\r\niugelour a day bifore him pleide faste And nemde in his ryme and in is\r\nsong þene deuel atþe laste’; King Horn (ed. Ritson), 1494 (†1300) ‘Men\r\nseide hit were harperis, Jogelers, ant fythelers.’ The incorrect modern\r\nFrench form _jongleur_ seems due to a confusion between _jougleur_ and\r\n_jangleur_, ‘babbler,’ and the English _jangler_ has a similar use; cf.\r\n_Piers the Plowman_, B. Text, _passus_ x. 31 (ed. Skeat, i. 286) ‘Iaperes\r\nand Iogeloures, and Iangelers of gestes.’ Here both words appear side\r\nby side. The English _jogelour_ sometimes has the full sense of the\r\nFrench _jougleur_, as in the instances just given, but as a term for\r\nminstrels of the higher or _scôp_ type it has to compete, firstly, with\r\nthe native _gleeman_, from O. E. _gleoman_, _gligman_, and secondly, with\r\n_minstrel_; and as a matter of fact its commoner use is for the lower\r\ntype of minstrel or buffoon, and in particular, in the exact sense of\r\nthe modern _juggler_, for a conjuror, _tregetour_ or _prestigiator_. The\r\nlatter is the usual meaning of _jogelour_, with the cognate _jogelrye_,\r\nin Chaucer; for the former, cf. Adam Davie (†1312) ‘the minstrels sing,\r\nthe jogelours carpe.’ In English documents the Latin _ioculator_ itself\r\nto some extent follows suit; the _ioculator regis_ of late fifteenth or\r\nearly sixteenth-century accounts is not a minstrel or musician, but the\r\nroyal _juggler_ (cf. vol. i. p. 68). On the other hand the Provençal\r\n_joglar_ is differentiated in the opposite sense, to denote a grade of\r\nminstrelsy raised above the mere _bufos_ (vol. i. p. 63).\r\n\r\nA street in Paris known at the end of the thirteenth century as\r\nthe ‘_rue aus Jugléeurs_,’ came later to be known as the _rue des\r\nMénétriers_ (Bernhard, iii. 378). This is significant of a new tendency\r\nin nomenclature which appears with the growth during the fourteenth\r\ncentury of the household entertainers at the expense of their unattached\r\nbrethren of the road. _Minister_ is classical Latin for ‘inferior’\r\nand so ‘personal attendant.’ The _ministeriales_ of the later Empire\r\nare officers personally appointed by the Emperor. Towards the end of\r\nthe thirteenth century _minister_, with its diminutives _ministellus_\r\nand _ministrallus_ (French _menestrel_), can be seen passing from the\r\ngeneral sense of ‘household attendant’ to the special sense of ‘household\r\n_ioculator_.’ A harper was one of the _ministri_ of Prince Edward in\r\n1270 (vol. i. p. 49). Gautier, ii. 13, 51, quotes _li famles_ (_famuli_)\r\nas a synonym for such _ioculatores_, and such doublets as ‘menestrel\r\net serviteur,’ ‘menestrel et varlet de chambre.’ The _ministeralli_ of\r\nPhilip IV in 1288 include, with the musicians, the _rex heraudum_ and\r\nthe _rex ribaldorum_. From the beginning of the fourteenth century,\r\nhowever, _ministrallus_, with French _menestrel_, _menestrier_, and\r\nEnglish _menestrel_, _mynstral_, is firmly established in the special\r\nsense. The antithesis between the _ministrallus_ and the unattached\r\n_ioculator_ appears in the terminology of the 1321 statutes of the\r\nParis guild, ‘menestreus et menestrelles, jougleurs et jougleresses’;\r\nbut even this disappears, and the new group of terms becomes equivalent\r\nto the _ioculator_ group in its widest sense. So too, _ministralcia_,\r\n_menestrardie_, _minstralcie_, although chiefly used, as by Chaucer, for\r\nmusic, are not confined to that; e.g. _Derby Accounts_, 109, ‘cuidam\r\ntumblere facienti ministralciam suam.’ The word is here approaching very\r\nnear its kinsman _métier_ (vol. ii. p. 105). Wright-Wülcker, 596, 693,\r\nquotes from the fifteenth-century glossaries, ‘_simphonia_, mynstrylsy,’\r\nand ‘_mimilogium_, mynstrisye.’\r\n\r\n_Ioculator_ and _ministrallus_ are in their technical sense\r\npost-classical. But it is to be noted that the classical _histrio_ and\r\n_mimus_, widened in connotation to an exact equivalent with these, remain\r\nin full use throughout the Middle Ages. They are indeed the more literary\r\nand learned words, as may be seen from the fact that they did not give\r\nrise to Romance or English forms; but they are not differentiated as to\r\nmeaning. In particular, I do not find that _mimus_ is used, as I have\r\noccasionally for convenience used it, to denote the lower minstrel of\r\nclassical origin, as against the higher minstrel or _scôp_. Here are\r\na few of many passages which go to establish this complete fourfold\r\nequivalence of _ioculator_, _ministrallus_, _mimus_ and _histrio_;\r\n_Gloss._ in _B.N. MS._ 4883ᵃ, f. 67ᵇ (Du Méril, _Or. Lat._ 23) ‘istriones\r\nsunt ioculatores’; _Constit. regis Minorcae_ (1337, Mabillon, _Acta\r\nSS. Bened. Ian._ iii. 27) ‘In domibus principum, ut tradit antiquitas,\r\nmimi seu ioculatores licite possunt esse’; _Conc. Lateran._ (1215), c.\r\n16 ‘mimis, ioculatoribus et histrionibus non intendant.’ This triple\r\nformula, often repeated by ecclesiastics, is of course conjunctive,\r\nlike ‘rogues and vagabonds.’ Guy of Amiens (†1068) calls Taillefer\r\nboth _histrio_ and _mimus_ (vol. i. p. 43). At the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century the royal minstrels are _histriones_ in the accounts\r\nof Shrewsbury, _ministralli_ in those of Winchester College (_App. E._\r\n(_iv_)), _mimi_ in those of Beverley (Leach, _Beverley MSS._ 171).\r\nThe _ioculator regis_, as already said, is by this time distinct. The\r\nScottish royal minstrels appear in the Exchequer Rolls for 1433-50 as\r\n_mimi_, _histriones_, _ioculatores_ (_L. H. T. Accounts_, i, cxcix). The\r\ntown musicians of Beverley, besides their specific names of _waits_ and\r\n_spiculatores_, have indifferently those of _histriones_, _ministralli_,\r\n_mimi_ (Leach, _Beverley MSS._ _passim_). It is largely a matter of\r\nthe personal taste of the scribe. Thus the Shrewsbury accounts have\r\nboth _histriones_ and _menstralles_ in 1401, _histriones_ in 1442,\r\n_ministralli_ regularly from 1457 to 1479, and _histriones_ regularly\r\nfrom 1483 onwards.\r\n\r\nMany other names for minstrels, besides these dominant four, have been\r\ncollected by scholars (Gautier, ii. 10; Julleville, _Les Com._ 17;\r\nGröber, ii. 489; Bédier, 366). From the compliments exchanged in the\r\n_fabliau_ of _Des Deux Bordeors Ribaux_ (Montaiglon-Raynaud, i. 1)\r\none may extract the equivalence of _menestrel_, _trouvère_, _ribaud_,\r\n_bordeor_, _jougleur_, _chanteur_, _lecheor_, _pantonnier_. Of such\r\nsubordinate names many are specific, and have been dealt with in their\r\nturn in chh. iii, iv. Others, again, are abusive, and found chiefly\r\nin the mouths of ecclesiastics, or as distinctive of the lower orders\r\nof minstrels. There are _garcio_, _nebulo_, _delusor_, _saccularius_,\r\n_bufo_, _ribaud_, _harlot_. There are _bourdyour_, _japer_, _gabber_,\r\n_jangler_ (vol. i. p. 84). There is _scurra_, an early and favourite term\r\nof this class; cf. Ælfric’s gloss (Ducange, s.v. _Iocista_), ‘_Mimus_,\r\n_iocista_, _scurra_, gligmon’; Wright-Wülcker, 693 (fifteenth-century\r\ngloss), ‘_scurra_, harlot’; and vol. i. p. 32. There is _leccator_,\r\n_leccour_ (cf. above and _App. F._ s.v. _Chester_). And finally, there\r\nare a few terms of general, but not very common, application. _Scenici_\r\nand _thymelici_ come from the early Christian prohibitions (vol. i. pp.\r\n12, 17, 24). More important are a group derived from _ludus_, which like\r\n_jeu_ has itself the widest possible sense, covering every possible kind\r\nof amusement. The _Sarum Statutes_ of 1319, in a _titulus_ dealing with\r\n_histriones_, speak of those ‘qui “menestralli” et quandoque “ludorum\r\nhomines” vulgari eloquio nuncupantur’ (vol. i. p. 40). In the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries appear such terms as _lusor_, _lusiator_,\r\n_ludens_, _interlusor_, _interludens_. The two latter of these are always\r\nspecific, meaning ‘actor’; the three former are usually so, although they\r\nmay occasionally have the more general sense, and this is probably also\r\ntrue of the English _player_. This question is more fully discussed in\r\nvol. i. pp. 84, 393, and vol. ii. p. 185.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC\r\n\r\nCOURT MINSTRELSY IN 1306\r\n\r\n    [From _Manners and Household Expenses of England in the\r\n    Thirteenth and Fifteenth Centuries_, 141 (Roxburghe Club,\r\n    1841), from Exchequer Roll (King’s Remembrancer’s Dept.)\r\n    in Rolls Office.

Poveret is perhaps the ‘roy\r\nde Champaigne’ of the 1306 list, which also includes the ‘roys’ Capenny,\r\nBaisescue, Marchis, Robert, and Druet (_Appendix C_). A ‘rex Robertus,’\r\ntogether with ‘rex Pagius de Hollandia,’ reappears in accounts of the\r\nreign of Edward II (1307-27), while one of the minstrels of the king was\r\nWilliam de Morlee, ‘roy de North’ (Percy, 416-8; cf. vol. i. p. 49).\r\nIn France a list of the ‘ministeralli’ of Philip IV in 1288 includes\r\nthe ‘rex Flaiolatus,’ ‘rex Heraudum,’ and ‘rex Ribaldorum.’ A certain\r\nPariset, who was minstrel to the Comte de Poitiers in 1314, signs the\r\nstatutes of the Paris guild in 1321 as ‘Pariset, menestrel le roy,’ and\r\nthe various ‘roys des menestreuls du royaume de France’ who appear in and\r\nafter 1338 may have been heads at once of the king’s household minstrels\r\nand of the guild (_Appendix F_; cf. Bernhard, iii. 380). Further, the\r\ntitle is claimed by the authors of various pieces of minstrel literature.\r\n‘Adenet le roi’ is the author of _Cleomadès_ (Paris, 84; Percy, 416-8),\r\nand ‘Huon le roi,’ perhaps identical with ‘Huon de Cambrai’ and\r\n‘Huon Paucele,’ of the _fabliau_ of _Du Vair Palefroi_ (Bédier, 438;\r\nMontaiglon-Raynaud, i. 3). The term _rex_ is of course common enough in\r\nconnexion with temporary or permanent associations of all sorts, and\r\nis probably of folk origin (vol. i. chaps. iv, viii). It is possible\r\nthat some of these ‘rois’ may have been crowned by ‘puis’ (Lavoix, ii.\r\n377), but it is more probable that they had some official pre-eminence\r\namongst their fellows, and perhaps some jurisdiction, territorial or\r\notherwise. Clearly this was the case with the ‘roy des ministralx’ at\r\nTutbury. The appearance of the ‘rex Flaiolatus’ with the ‘rex Heraudum’\r\nand the ‘rex Ribaldorum’ in the French list of 1288 is thus significant,\r\nfor the latter had just such a jurisdiction over the riff-raff of the\r\ncourt (Ducange, s.v.), and I conceive the relation of the minstrel ‘roys’\r\nto their fellows to have been much that of the ‘Kings at arms’ to the\r\nordinary heralds. It seems that minstrels and heralds belonged to the\r\nsame class of _ministri_. The order of the Emperor Henry II (vol. i. p.\r\n52) couples ‘ioculatores et armaturi’ and ‘Carleton Haralde’ is actually\r\nrewarded in the 1306 list (_App. C_, p. 237). If one may quote a Celtic\r\nparallel, the _Arwyddfardd_ or heralds formed a regular division (†1100)\r\nof Welsh minstrelsy (E. David, _La Poésie et la Musique dans la Cambrie_,\r\n72-91). Under Richard II the head of the English royal minstrels was\r\na _rex_, but from 1464 onwards the term used is _marescallus_ (Rymer,\r\nxi. 512), and this again may be paralleled from the supreme position of\r\nthe Earl Marshal in heraldry. At the head of the Earl of Lancaster’s\r\nminstrels in 1308 was an _armiger_. I only find this term again in the\r\nburlesque account of the ‘auncient minstrell’ shown before Elizabeth at\r\nKenilworth (_Appendix H_). He was ‘a squier minstrel of Middilsex’ and,\r\nas he bore the arms of Islington, presumably a ‘wait.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM ACCOUNT BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. DURHAM PRIORY.\r\n\r\n    [The entries, unless otherwise specified, are amongst the\r\n    extracts (generally of _Dona Prioris_) from the Bursars’ Rolls\r\n    between 1278 and 1371, printed by Canon Fowler in vols. ii,\r\n    iii of the _Durham Account Rolls_ (Surtees Soc.). _D. H. B._ =\r\n    _Durham Household Book_ (Surtees Soc.), _F. P._ = _Inventories\r\n    and Account Rolls of Finchale Priory_ (Surtees Soc.). This\r\n    was a cell of Durham Priory. The minstrelsy often took place\r\n    at the _ludi Domini Prioris_, either in his _camera_ (_D. A._\r\n    ii. 424) or at Beaurepaire, Witton, or other _maneria_ of\r\n    the Priory. There seem to have been in most years four _ludi\r\n    ordinarii_ (_D. A._ ii. 296), though occasionally only two or\r\n    three are mentioned. These were at the feasts of Candlemas,\r\n    Easter, St. John Baptist, and All Saints (_D. A._ i. 242, iii.\r\n    932). But the Prior, Sub-Prior, and brethren seem often to have\r\n    been _ludentes_, _spatiantes_, or _in recreacione_ (_D. A._ i.\r\n    118, 235), without much regard to fixed dates. In 1438-9 they\r\n    were _ludentes_ for as much as eleven weeks and four days at\r\n    Beaurepaire (_D. A._ i. 71). See also _D.

THETFORD PRIORY.\r\n\r\n    [From Collier, i. 55, 84, on the authority of a ‘MS. of the\r\n    expenses of the Priory of Thetford, from 1461 to 1540, lately\r\n    in the collection of Mr. Craven Orde, and now of the Duke of\r\n    Newcastle.’]\r\n\r\n‘The mention of “plays” and “players” does not begin until the 13ᵗʰ of\r\nHenry VII; but “Minstrels” and “Waytes” are often spoken of there as\r\nreceiving rewards from the convent. The following entries, regarding\r\n“plays” and “players,” occur between the 13ᵗʰ and 23ʳᵈ of Henry VII:—\r\n\r\n  13 Henry VII [1497-8].\r\n       Itᵐ. sol. in regard 12 capital plays, 4ˢ.\r\n       Itᵐ. sol. to menstrell and players in festo Epiphaniae, 2ˢ.\r\n\r\n  19 Henry VII [1503-4].\r\n       Itᵐ. sol. to the play of Mydenale, 12ᵈ.\r\n\r\n  21 Henry VII [1505-6].\r\n       Itᵐ. sol. in regard lusoribus et menstrall, 17ᵈ.\r\n\r\n  23 Henry VII [1507-8].\r\n       Itᵐ. sol. in regard lusoribus div. vices, 3ˢ 4ᵈ.\r\n       Itᵐ. sol. in regard to Ixworth play, 16ᵈ.\r\n       Itᵐ. sol. in regard to Schelfanger play, 4ᵈ.\r\n\r\n... From the 1ˢᵗ to the 31ˢᵗ Henry VIII, the King’s players, the King’s\r\njugglers, the King’s minstrels, and the King’s bearwards were visitors of\r\nThetford, and were paid various sums, from 4ᵈ to 6ˢ 8ᵈ, by the Prior of\r\nthe convent there, as appears by the entries in the account-book during\r\nthat period. On one occasion, 16 Henry VIII, Cornyshe, “the master of the\r\nKing’s chapel,” was paid 3ˢ 4ᵈ by the prior; but he was then, probably,\r\nattendant upon the King, who is not unfrequently spoken of as having\r\narrived, and being lodged at the Priory. Mr. Brandon and Mr. Smith are\r\nmore than once rewarded as “Jugglers of the King.” The Queen’s players,\r\nthe Prince’s players, and the players of the Queen of France, also\r\nexperienced the liberality of the Prior, as well as those of the Duke\r\nof Norfolk, the Duke of Suffolk, the Earl and Countess of Derby, Lord\r\nand Lady Fitzwater, the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas\r\nChalloner and two gentlemen who are called Marks and Barney.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.

The _satrapae_ of 1466 and 1479 are said by\r\n    Mr. Walcott to have been local notables, but a collation to\r\n    them would not cost so little or be grouped with rewards to\r\n    minstrels in the _computus_.

FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Arras_, †1105.\r\n\r\nThe famous _Pui d’Arras_ (vols. i. p. 376, ii. p. 88) was in a sense\r\na minstrel guild. According to tradition a plague was stayed by a\r\nsimultaneous apparition of the Virgin in a dream to two minstrels, which\r\nled to the acquisition of ‘le joyel d’Arras,’ the miraculous ‘cierge\r\nde notre Dame.’ This was about 1105, and the result was the foundation\r\nof the _Confrérie_ or _Carité de N. D. des Ardents_, which afterwards\r\ndeveloped into the _pui_. This was not confined to minstrels, but they\r\nwere predominant. The _Statutes_ say, ‘Ceste carité est estorée des\r\njogleors, et les jogleors en sont signors[680].’ The objects of the\r\n_pui_, however, were religious, social, and literary. It was not a craft\r\nguild, such as grew up two centuries later.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Paris_, 1321.\r\n\r\nOrdinances were made in 1321 ‘à l’acort du commun des menestreus et\r\nmenestrelles, jougleurs et jougleresses’ of Paris for the reformation\r\nof their ‘mestier,’ and registered with the provost of Paris in 1341.\r\nThey chiefly regulate the employment of minstrels within the city. The\r\n‘mestres du dit mestier’ are to be ‘ii ou iii preudes hommes’ appointed\r\nby the provost on behalf of the King. A number of ‘guètes’ and other\r\nminstrels sign, beginning with ‘Pariset, menestrel le roy,’ and ending\r\nwith ‘Jaque le Jougleur.’ As a possible head of the ‘mestier’ is named\r\n‘li prevost de Saint-Julian.’ This seems to contemplate the foundation\r\nof the _hospice et confrérie_ under the patronage of SS. Julian and\r\nGenesius, and in close connexion with the ‘mestier,’ which actually took\r\nplace 1328-35. But in the later Statutes of 1407 the head of the guild is\r\ncalled the ‘roy des ménestriers,’ and as by this time the guild seems to\r\nclaim some authority over the whole of France, it is probable that this\r\n‘roy’ was identical with the ‘roy des menestreuls du royaume de France,’\r\na title which occurs in various documents from 1338 onwards. He may also\r\nhave been identical with the ‘roy’ of the King’s household minstrels\r\n(cf. p. 239). The Paris guild lasted until the suppression of all such\r\nprivileged bodies in 1776[681].\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Chauny._\r\n\r\nThe corporation of ‘les Trompettes jougleurs’ of Chauny was founded\r\nduring the fifteenth century. This town claimed to provide _bateleurs_\r\nfor all the north of France[682].\r\n\r\n\r\nB. ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThere are two early jurisdictions over minstrelsy, which are not strictly\r\nof the nature of guilds.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Chester._\r\n\r\nTradition has it that †1210 Randal Blundeville, Earl of Chester, besieged\r\nby the Welsh in Rhuddlan Castle, was relieved by Roger Lacy, constable\r\nof Cheshire, with a mob of riff-raff from Chester Midsummer fair. Randal\r\ngave to Lacy, and Lacy’s son John gave to his steward Hugh de Dutton\r\nand his heirs the ‘magistratum omnium leccatorum et meretricum totius\r\nCestriae.’ The fact of the jurisdiction is undoubted. It was reserved by\r\nthe charter to the London guild in 1469, claimed by Laurence de Dutton\r\nin 1499, admitted upon an action of _quo warranto_ as a right ‘from time\r\nimmemorial,’ further reserved in the first Vagrant Act (1572) which\r\nspecifically included minstrels, and in the successive Acts of 1597,\r\n1603, 1628, 1641, 1713, 1740, 1744. It lapsed when this last Act was\r\nrepealed in 1822. Up to 1756 the heir of Dutton regularly held his _curia\r\nMinstralciae_ at Chester Midsummer fair, and issued licences to fiddlers\r\nin the city and county for a fee of 4½_d._, afterwards raised to 2_s._\r\n6_d._ Thomas Dutton (1569-1614), under puritan influences, inserted a\r\nproviso against piping and dancing on Sundays[683].\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Tutbury._\r\n\r\nLetters patent of John of Gaunt dated 1380 and confirmed by an\r\n‘inspeximus’ of Henry VI in 1443 assigned ‘le roy des ministralx’ in the\r\nhonour of Tutbury to arrest all minstrels within the honour not doing\r\nservice on the feast of the Assumption. It was a custom that the prior\r\nof Tutbury should provide a bull for a bull-running by the assembled\r\nminstrels on this feast. The court was still held by an annual ‘king of\r\nthe fiddlers,’ with the steward and bailiff of the honour (including\r\nStaffs., Derby, Notts., Leicester, and Warwick), at the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, and the minstrels claimed to be exempt, like\r\nthose of Chester, from vagrancy legislation. But their rights were not\r\nreserved, either by the Charter of 1469 or the Vagrant Acts[684].\r\n\r\nThe first English craft guild of minstrels is later by a century and a\r\nhalf than that of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _London._\r\n\r\nA charter of Edward IV (1469), ‘ex querelosa insinuatione dilectorum\r\nnobis Walteri Haliday, marescalli [and seven others] ministrallorum\r\nnostrorum,’ declares that ‘nonnulli rudes Agricolae et Artifices\r\ndiversarum Misterarum Regni nostri Angliae finxerunt se fore\r\nMinistrallos. Quorum aliqui Liberatam nostram, eis minime datam,\r\nportarunt, seipsos etiam fingentes esse Ministrallos nostros proprios.\r\nCuius quidem Liberatae ac dictae Artis sive Occupationis Ministrallorum\r\ncolore in diversis Partibus Regni nostri praedicti grandes Pecuniarum\r\nExactiones de Ligeis nostris deceptive colligunt et recipiunt.’ Hence\r\nillegitimate competition with the real minstrels, decay of the art, and\r\nneglect of agriculture. The charter then does two things. It makes the\r\nroyal minstrels a corporation with a marshall elected by themselves, and\r\nit puts them at the head of a ‘Fraternitatem sive Gildam’ of minstrels\r\nalready existing in the chapel of the Virgin in St. Paul’s, and in\r\nthe royal free chapel of St. Anthony. All minstrels in the country\r\nare to join this guild or be suppressed. It is to have two _custodes_\r\nand to make statutes and ordinances. The jurisdiction of Dutton over\r\nChester minstrels is, as already stated, reserved[685]. A ‘serviens’ or\r\n‘serjeant’ seems to have been an officer of the guild[686]. With this\r\nexception nothing more is heard of it until 1594, when a dispute as\r\nto the office of the Master of the Musicians’ Company called for the\r\nintervention of the Lord Keeper[687].’ In 1604 the Company received a\r\nnew charter, which gave it jurisdiction within the city and a radius\r\nof three miles from its boundaries. It was further restricted to the\r\ncity itself under Charles I. It still exists as the Corporation of the\r\nMaster, Wardens, and Commonalty of the Art or Science of the Musicians of\r\nLondon[688].\r\n\r\nThe London guild would appear, from its peculiar relation to the\r\nroyal household minstrels, and its claim to jurisdiction throughout\r\nthe country, to have been modelled upon that of Paris. This claim was\r\nevidently not maintained, and in fact at least three other local guilds\r\ncan be shown to have existed in the sixteenth century. A search, which I\r\nhave not undertaken, would probably readily discover more.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Canterbury._\r\n\r\nOrdinances, dated 1526, of the ‘felowshyp of the craft and mystery of\r\nmynstrells’ give the prerogative right to perform in the city to the\r\nmembers of this body, saving the privileges of the city waits, and ‘the\r\nKing’s mynstrells, the Queane’s, my Lord Prince’s, or any honorable or\r\nwurshipfull mann’s mynstrells of thys realme[689].’\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Beverley._\r\n\r\nAn order of the Governors of the city (1555) recites an old custom ‘since\r\nAthelstan’ of the choice by minstrels between Trent and Tweed of aldermen\r\nof their fraternities during Rogation days, and renews orders for the\r\n‘fraternity of our Lady of the read arke in Beverley.’ The statutes deal\r\nwith the employment of minstrels in Beverley, and with their ‘castells’\r\nat the Rogation-day procession. A new member must be ‘mynstrell to some\r\nman of honour or worship or waite of some towne corporate or other\r\nancient town or else of such honestye and conyng as shalbe thought\r\nlaudable and pleasant to the hearers.’ It is claimed that such are\r\nexcluded from the ‘Kyng’s acts where they speake of vacabonds and\r\nvaliant beggers.’ Quite in the spirit of the London charter of 1469 it\r\nis ordered that ‘no myler shepherd or of other occupation or husbandman\r\nor husbandman servant’ shall assume the functions of a minstrel outside\r\nhis own parish[690]. The earliest notice of this guild in the Beverley\r\narchives seems to be in 1557[691], but the terms of the order and the\r\nexistence of pillars put up by the minstrels in fifteenth-century\r\nchurches in Beverley[692] point to some informal earlier association.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _York._\r\n\r\nA craft of Mynstrells certainly existed by 1561, in which year they\r\nundertook the pageant of Herod at the Corpus Christi plays[693].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nG\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DE CABHAM\r\n\r\n    [The following extract from a _Penitential_ formerly ascribed\r\n    to John of Salisbury, but now to Thomas de Cabham, Bishop\r\n    of Salisbury (†1313), is printed by B. Hauréau, _Notices et\r\n    Extraits de Manuscrits_, xxiv. 2, 284, from _B. N. MSS. Lat._\r\n    3218 and 3529ᵃ, and by F. Guessard and C. Grandmaison, _Huon de\r\n    Bordeaux_, vi., from _B. N. Sorbonne MS._ 1552, f. 71. The two\r\n    texts differ in several points. According to Gautier, ii. 22,\r\n    there are several similar thirteenth-century _Penitentials_,\r\n    and it is difficult to say which was the original. The doctrine\r\n    laid down about minstrels is often repeated in later treatises.\r\n    See e.g. a passage from the fifteenth-century _Le Jardin des\r\n    Nobles_ in P. Paris, _Manuscrits français_, ii. 144.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTria sunt histrionum genera. Quidam transformant et transfigurant corpora\r\nsua per turpes saltus et per turpes gestus, vel denudando se turpiter,\r\nvel induendo horribiles larvas, et omnes tales damnabiles sunt, nisi\r\nreliquerint officia sua. Sunt etiam alii qui nihil operantur, sed\r\ncriminose agunt, non habentes certum domicilium, sed sequuntur curias\r\nmagnatum et dicunt opprobria et ignominias de absentibus ut placeant\r\naliis. Tales etiam damnabiles sunt, quia prohibet Apostolus cum talibus\r\ncibum sumere, et dicuntur tales scurrae vagi, quia ad nihil utiles sunt,\r\nnisi ad devorandum et maledicendum. Est etiam tertium genus histrionum\r\nqui habent instrumenta musica ad delectandum homines, et talium sunt\r\nduo genera. Quidam enim frequentant publicas potationes et lascivas\r\ncongregationes, et cantant ibi diversas cantilenas ut moveant homines\r\nad lasciviam, et tales sunt damnabiles sicut alii. Sunt autem alii, qui\r\ndicuntur ioculatores, qui cantant gesta principum et vitam sanctorum, et\r\nfaciunt solatia hominibus vel in aegritudinibus suis vel in angustiis,\r\net non faciunt innumeras turpitudines sicut faciunt saltatores et\r\nsaltatrices et alii qui ludunt in imaginibus inhonestis et faciunt videri\r\nquasi quaedam fantasmata per incantationes vel alio modo. Si autem non\r\nfaciunt talia, sed cantant in instrumentis suis gesta principum et alia\r\ntalia utilia ut faciant solatia hominibus, sicut supradictum est, bene\r\npossunt sustineri tales, sicut ait Alexander papa. Cum quidam ioculator\r\nquaereret ab eo utrum posset salvare animam suam in officio suo,\r\nquaesivit Papa ab eo utrum sciret aliquod aliud opus unde vivere posset:\r\nrespondit ioculator quod non. Permisit igitur Papa quod ipse viveret de\r\nofficio suo, dummodo abstineret a praedictis lasciviis et turpitudinibus.\r\nNotandum est quod omnes peccant mortaliter qui dant scurris vel\r\nleccatoribus vel praedictis histrionibus aliquid de suo.

S. i. 94 (1869).]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the north-east corner of the central mountainous region represented on\r\nthe map, between the Mahanadi and Godavery rivers, is found a tribe which\r\nhas preserved its normal character remarkably free from change and from\r\nexternal influence. The Konds, or, as they call themselves, the Kuingas,\r\nalthough only discovered within the last thirty-five years, are better\r\nknown than most of the other barbarous tribes from the fact that for ages\r\nthey have been in the habit of sacrificing human victims in great numbers\r\nto secure the favour of the deities presiding over their dwellings,\r\nfields, hills, &c., but especially of the earth-goddess.\r\n\r\nThe successful efforts employed to abolish this barbarous rite have made\r\nthe subject familiar to all, and it is remarkable that such knowledge\r\nshould have failed to attract attention to a practice precisely similar\r\nin its objects and in its details, which is observed in every village\r\nof Southern India, with this single difference, that a buffalo is\r\nsubstituted for a human victim. My attention was early drawn to this\r\npractice, which is called the festival of the village goddess (_Devi_,\r\nor _Grama Devati_), the descriptions of which led me to believe it might\r\nthrow light on the early condition of the servile classes, and resolving\r\nto witness its celebrations, I repaired to the village of Serúr, in the\r\nSouthern Mahratta country, in March, 1829. It would occupy too much time\r\nto describe the ceremony in full, which is the less necessary as the\r\ndetails vary in different places; but the general features are always the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThe temple of the goddess is a mean structure outside the village.\r\nThe officiating priests are the Parias, who, on this occasion, and on\r\nit alone, are exempt from the degrading condition which excludes them\r\nfrom the village, and from contact with the inhabitants. With them are\r\nincluded the Mangs or workers in leather, the Asádis or Dásaris, _paria_\r\ndancing-girls devoted to the service of the temple, the musician in\r\nattendance on them called Rániga, who acts also as a sort of jester or\r\nbuffoon, and a functionary called Pót-raj, who officiates as _pujári_ to\r\na rural god named also Pót-raj, to whom a small altar is erected behind\r\nthe temple of the village goddess. He is armed with a long whip, which he\r\ncracks with great dexterity, and to which also at various parts of the\r\nceremony divine honours are paid.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the village community take part in the festival with\r\nthe hereditary district officers, many of them Brahmans. The shepherds\r\nor _Dhangars_ of the neighbouring villages are also invited, and they\r\nattend with their priests called _Virgars_ or _Irgars_, accompanied by\r\nthe _dhol_ or big drum peculiar to their caste. But the whole is under\r\nthe guidance and management of the Parias.\r\n\r\nThe festival commences always on a Tuesday, the day of rest among the\r\nagricultural classes, both for man and beast. The most important and\r\nessential ceremonies take place on the second and fifth days. On the\r\nformer, the sacred buffalo, which had been purchased by the Parias, an\r\nanimal without a blemish, is thrown down before the goddess, its head\r\nstruck off by a single blow and placed in front of the shrine with one\r\nfore-leg thrust into its mouth. Around are placed vessels containing\r\nthe different cereals, and hard by a heap of mixed grains, with a drill\r\nplough in the centre. The carcase is then cut up into small pieces, and\r\neach cultivator receives a portion to bury in his field. The blood and\r\noffal are collected into a large basket, over which some pots of the\r\ncooked food which had been presented as a meat offering (_naivedya_)\r\nhad previously been broken, and Pót-raj taking a live kid called the\r\n_hari-mariah_, hews it in pieces over the whole. The mess (_cheraga_)\r\nis then mixed together, and the basket being placed on the head of a\r\nnaked Mang, he runs off with it, flinging the contents into the air, and\r\nscattering them right and left, as an offering (_bhut-bali_) to the evil\r\nspirits, and followed by the other Parias, and the village Paiks, with\r\ndrawn swords. Sometimes the demons arrest the progress of the party, when\r\nmore of the mess is thrown about, and fowls and sheep are sacrificed,\r\ntill the spirits are appeased.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time of the sacrifice the armed paiks keep vigilant\r\nguard, lest any intruder should secrete a morsel of flesh or a drop of\r\nblood, which, if carried off successfully, after declaring the purpose,\r\nwould transfer the merit of the offering to the strangers’ village.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the party from making the circuit of the village another\r\nbuffalo, seized by force wherever it can be found (_zulmi-khulga_) is\r\nsacrificed by decapitating it in the same manner as the former; but no\r\nparticular importance is attached to it, and the flesh is distributed to\r\nbe eaten.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth days are devoted to private offerings. On the former\r\nall the inhabitants of caste, who had vowed animals to the goddess during\r\nthe preceding three years for the welfare of their families, or the\r\nfertility of their fields, brought the buffaloes or sheep to the _paria\r\npujári_, who struck off their heads. The fourth day was appropriated\r\nexclusively to the offerings of the Parias. In this way, some fifty or\r\nsixty buffaloes and several hundred sheep were slain, and the heads\r\npiled up in two great heaps. Many women on these days walked naked to\r\nthe temple in fulfilment of vows, but they were covered with leaves and\r\nboughs of trees and surrounded by their female relations and friends.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth and last day (Saturday) the whole community marched in\r\nprocession, with music, to the temple, and offered a concluding sacrifice\r\nat the Pót-raj altar. A lamb was concealed close by. The Pót-raj having\r\nfound it after a pretended search, struck it simply with his whip, which\r\nhe then placed upon it, and, making several passes with his hands,\r\nrendered it insensible; in fact, mesmerised it. When it became rigid and\r\nstiff he lifted it up and carried it about on the palm of his hand, to\r\nthe amazement of the spectators, and then laid it down on the ground. His\r\nhands were then tied behind his back by the _pujári_, and the whole party\r\nbegan to dance round him with noisy shouts, the music and the shepherd’s\r\ndrum making a deafening noise. Pót-raj joined in the excitement, his eyes\r\nbegan to roll, his long hair fell loose over his shoulders, and he soon\r\ncame fully under the influence of the _numen_. He was now led up, still\r\nbound, to the place where the lamb lay motionless. He rushed at it,\r\nseized it with his teeth, tore through the skin, and ate into its throat.\r\nWhen it was quite dead, he was lifted up, a dishful of the meat offering\r\nwas presented to him; he thrust his bloody face into it, and it was then,\r\nwith the remains of the lamb, buried beside the altar. Meantime his hands\r\nwere untied, and he fled the place, and did not appear for three days.\r\nThe rest of the party now adjourned to the front of the temple, where the\r\nheap of grain deposited the first day was divided among the cultivators,\r\nto be buried by each one in his field with the bit of flesh. After this\r\na distribution of the piled-up heads was made by the hand of the Rániga.\r\nAbout forty sheep’s heads were given to certain privileged persons,\r\namong which two were allotted to the Sircar! For the rest a general\r\nscramble took place, paiks, shepherds, Parias, and many boys and men\r\nof good caste, were soon rolling in the mass of putrid gore. The heads\r\nwere flung about in all directions, without regard to rank or caste,\r\nthe Brahmans coming in for an ample share of the filth. The scramble\r\nfor the buffalo heads was confined to the Parias. Whoever was fortunate\r\nenough to secure one of either kind carried it off and buried it in his\r\nfield. The proceedings terminated by a procession round the boundaries of\r\nthe village lands, preceded by the goddess, and the head of the sacred\r\nbuffalo carried on the head of one of the Mangs. All order and propriety\r\nnow ceased. Rániga began to abuse the goddess in the foulest terms; he\r\nthen turned his fury against the government, the head man of the village,\r\nand every one who fell in his way. The Parias and Asádis attacked the\r\nmost respectable and gravest citizens, and laid hold of the Brahmans,\r\nLingayats, and Zamindars without scruple. The dancing-women jumped on\r\ntheir shoulders, the shepherds beat the big drum, with deafening clangor,\r\nand universal license reigned.\r\n\r\nOn reaching a little temple, sacred to the goddess of boundaries\r\n(_polimera-amma_), they halted to make some offerings, and bury the\r\nsacred head. As soon as it was covered, the uproar began again. Rániga\r\nbecame more foul-mouthed than ever. In vain the head-men, the government\r\nofficers, and others tried to pacify him by giving him small copper\r\ncoins. He only broke out with worse imprecations and grosser abuse, till\r\nthe circuit being completed, all dispersed; the Parias retired to their\r\nhamlet outside the town, resuming their humble, servile character, and\r\nthe village reverted to its wonted peaceful appearance.\r\n\r\nNext day (Sunday) the whole population turned out to a great\r\nhunting-party.\r\n\r\nI found this remarkable institution existing in every part of India where\r\nI have been, and I have descriptions of it corresponding in all essential\r\npoints, from the Dekhan, the Nizam’s country, Mysore, the Carnatic, and\r\nthe Northern Circars. The details vary in different places, but the\r\nmain features agree in all, and correspond remarkably with the _Mariah_\r\nsacrifice of the Konds, which also varies considerably on minor points in\r\ndifferent places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ\r\n\r\nSWORD-DANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nI. SWEDEN (_Sixteenth Century_).\r\n\r\n    [From Olaus Magnus, _Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus_\r\n    (1555), Bk. xv. chh. 23, 24.]\r\n\r\nCh. 23, _de chorea gladiatoria vel armifera saltatione_.\r\n\r\nHabent septentrionales Gothi et Sueci pro exercenda iuventute alium\r\nludum, quod inter nudos enses et infestos gladios seu frameas sese\r\nexerceant saltu, idque quodam gymnastico ritu et disciplina, aetate\r\nsuccessiva, a peritis et praesultare sub cantu addiscunt: et ostendunt\r\nhunc ludum praecipue tempore carnisprivii, maschararum Italico verbo\r\ndicto. Ante etenim tempus eiusdem carnisprivii octo diebus continua\r\nsaltatione sese adolescentes numerose exercent, elevatis scilicet\r\ngladiis sed vagina reclusis, ad triplicem gyrum. Deinde evaginatis\r\nitidemque elevatis ensibus, postmodo manuatim extensis, modestius gyrando\r\nalterutrius cuspidem capulumque receptantes, sese mutato ordine in modum\r\nfigurae hexagoni fingendi subiiciunt, quam rosam dicunt: et illico eam\r\ngladios retrahendo elevandoque resolvunt ut super uniuscuiusque caput\r\nquadrata rosa resultet: et tandem vehementissima gladiorum laterali\r\ncollisione, celerrime retrograda saltatione determinant ludum, quem\r\ntibiis vel cantilenis, aut utrisque simul, primum per graviorem, demum\r\nvehementiorem saltum et ultimo impetuosissimum moderantur.

Utque id festivius\r\nsonoriusque fiat, tintinnabula seu aereas campanulas genu tenus ligant.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SHETLAND (_Eighteenth Century_).\r\n\r\n    [From Sir Walter Scott’s _Diary_ for August 7, 1814, printed in\r\n    Lockhart, _Life of Scott_ (1837), iii. 162; (1878) i. 265.]\r\n\r\nAt Scalloway my curiosity was gratified by an account of the sword-dance,\r\nnow almost lost, but still practised in the Island of Papa, belonging\r\nto Mr. Scott. There are eight performers, seven of whom represent the\r\nSeven Champions of Christendom, who enter one by one with their swords\r\ndrawn, and are presented to the eighth personage, who is not named.\r\nSome rude couplets are spoken (in _English_, not _Norse_), containing\r\na sort of panegyric upon each champion as he is presented. They then\r\ndance a sort of cotillion, as the ladies described it, going through\r\na number of evolutions with their swords. One of my three Mʳˢ. Scotts\r\nreadily promised to procure me the lines, the rhymes, and the form of\r\nthe dance.... A few years since a party of Papa-men came to dance the\r\nsword-dance at Lerwick as a public exhibition with great applause....\r\nIn a stall pamphlet, called the history of Buckshaven [Fifeshire], it\r\nis said those fishers sprung from Danes, and brought with them their\r\n_war-dance_ or _sword-dance_, and a rude wooden cut of it is given.\r\n\r\n[A footnote by Lockhart adds:—]\r\n\r\nMr. W. S. Rose informs me that, when he was at school at Winchester,\r\nthe morris-dancers there used to exhibit a sword-dance resembling that\r\ndescribed at Camacho’s wedding in _Don Quixote_; and Mr. Morritt adds\r\nthat similar dances are even yet performed in the villages about Rokeby\r\n[Yorks, N.R.] every Christmas.\r\n\r\n    [The following account was inserted in a note to Scott’s _The\r\n    Pirate_ (1821).]\r\n\r\nTo the Primate’s account of the sword-dance, I am able to add the words\r\nsung or chanted, on occasion of this dance, as it is still performed in\r\nPapa Stour, a remote island of Zetland, where alone the custom keeps its\r\nground. It is, it will be observed by antiquaries, a species of play\r\nor mystery, in which the Seven Champions of Christendom make their\r\nappearance, as in the interlude presented in _All’s Well that ends Well_.\r\nThis dramatic curiosity was most kindly procured for my use by Dr. Scott\r\nof Haslar Hospital [died 1875], son of my friend Mr. Scott of Melbie,\r\nZetland. Dr. Hibbert has, in his _Description of the Zetland Islands_,\r\ngiven an account of the sword-dance, but somewhat less full than the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n    ‘WORDS USED AS A PRELUDE TO THE SWORD-DANCE, A DANISH OR\r\n    NORWEGIAN BALLET, COMPOSED SOME CENTURIES AGO, AND PRESERVED IN\r\n    PAPA STOUR, ZETLAND.\r\n\r\nPERSONÆ DRAMATIS[694].\r\n\r\n(_Enter MASTER, in the character of

                                       [_He dances.—Music begins._’\r\n\r\n‘FIGUIR[701].\r\n\r\n  ‘The six stand in rank with their swords reclining on their shoulders.\r\n  The Master (Saint George) dances, and then strikes the sword of James\r\n  of Spain, who follows George, then dances, strikes the sword of\r\n  Dennis, who follows behind James. In like manner the rest—the music\r\n  playing—swords as before. After the six are brought out of rank, they\r\n  and the Master form a circle, and hold the swords point and hilt. This\r\n  circle is danced round twice. The whole, headed by the Master, pass\r\n  under the swords held in a vaulted manner. They jump over the swords.\r\n  This naturally places the swords across, which they disentangle by\r\n  passing under their right sword. They take up the seven swords, and\r\n  form a circle, in which they dance round.\r\n\r\n  ‘The Master runs under the sword opposite, which he jumps over\r\n  backwards. The others do the same. He then passes under the right-hand\r\n  sword, which the others follow, in which position they dance, until\r\n  commanded by the Master, when they form into a circle, and dance round\r\n  as before. They then jump over the right-hand sword, by which means\r\n  their backs are to the circle, and their hands across their backs. They\r\n  dance round in that form until the Master calls “Loose,” when they pass\r\n  under the right sword, and are in a perfect circle.\r\n\r\n  ‘The Master lays down his sword, and lays hold of the point of James’s\r\n  sword. He then turns himself, James, and the others, into a clew. When\r\n  so formed, he passes under out of the midst of the circle; the others\r\n  follow; they vault as before. After several other evolutions, they\r\n  throw themselves into a circle, with their arms across the breast.\r\n  They afterwards form such figures as to form a shield of their swords,\r\n  and the shield is so compact that the Master and his knights dance\r\n  alternately with this shield upon their heads.

Mus. Egerton MS._ 2615, f. 1,\r\n    with music for singing in unison: (_c_) [B²]—Same _MS._ f. 43,\r\n    with music harmonized in three parts; partly facsimiled in\r\n    _Annales Archéologiques_ (1856), xvi. 259, 300.\r\n\r\n    ii. _Sens, thirteenth century._—[S]—_MS. Senonense_, 46ᵃ, as\r\n    printed by G. M. Dreves, _Analecta Hymnica_, xx. 217. The text\r\n    has also been given from the MS. by F. Bourquelot, in _Bull. de\r\n    la Soc. Arch. de Sens_ (1858), vi. 79, and others. The version\r\n    of Clément, 126 is probably, like the facsimile given by him in\r\n    _Ann. Arch._ vii. 26, based on one ‘calqué’ from the MS. by a\r\n    M. Amé, and, where it differs from that of Dreves, is the less\r\n    trustworthy. Dreves, xx. 257 (cf. _infra_) and Millin, _Monum.\r\n    Ant. Inédits_, ii. 348, also give the music of the opening\r\n    lines. Modern settings are provided by B. De la Borde, _Essai\r\n    sur la Musique_ (1780), and Clément, in _Ann. Arch._ vii. 26,\r\n    and _Chantes de la Sainte Chapelle_. An old French translation\r\n    of the text is printed in Leber, ix. 368.\r\n\r\n    On these Beauvais and Sens MSS. cf. ch. xiii.\r\n\r\n    iii. _Bourges._—[Bo.]—The first verse with the music and\r\n    variants in the later verses are given by A. Gachet d’Artigny,\r\n    _Nouveaux Mémoires_ (1756), vii. 77, from a copy of a book\r\n    given to Bourges cathedral by a canon named Jean Pastoris. Part\r\n    of the Bourges music is also given by Millin, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n    I print the fullest version from Ducange, italicizing the\r\n    lines not found elsewhere, and giving all variants, except of\r\n    spelling, for the rest.\r\n\r\n    Outside Beauvais, Sens, and Bourges the only localized allusion\r\n    to the prose that I have found is the Autun order of 1411\r\n    (vol. i. p. 312) ‘nec dicatur cantilena quae dici solebat\r\n    super dictum asinum.’ It is not in the Puy _officium_ for the\r\n    Circumcision, which, though in a MS. of 1553, represents a\r\n    ceremony as old as 1327 (U. Chevalier, _Prosolarium Ecclesiae\r\n    Aniciensis_, 1894). The _officium_ is full of _conductus_ and\r\n    _farsumina_, and the _clericuli_ at second Vespers _tripudiant\r\n    firmiter_. The _sanctum Praepucium_ was a relic at Puy.\r\n\r\n    The following passage is from Theoph. Raynaudus, _Iudicium de\r\n    puerorum symphoniacorum processione in festo SS. Innocentium_\r\n    (_Opera Omnia_, 1665, xv. 209): ‘Legi prosam quandam _de asino_\r\n    e Metropolitanae cuiusdam Ecclesiae rituali exscriptam; quae\r\n    super sacrum concinebatur in die S.

Henderson, 1882, 17) and 1555 and the printed\r\n    _Breviary_ (ed. Procter-Wordsworth, I. ccxxix). Mr. Wordsworth\r\n    also found the office in two MS. breviaries (_Sarum Chapter\r\n    MS._ 152 and _Peterhouse, Cambridge, MS._ 270). In the MS.\r\n    (†1445) processional from Salisbury Cathedral (_Chapter MS._\r\n    148), on which his book is mainly based, there is a _lacuna_,\r\n    probably due to intentional mutilation, where the office\r\n    should come. I find no allusion to the Boy Bishop in the\r\n    printed _Sarum Missal_ (ed.

CAESARIUS OF ARLES?\r\n\r\n    [_Sermo Pseud.-Augustin._ cxxix _de Kal. Ian._ in _P. L._\r\n    xxxix. 2001. Parts of this sermon are reproduced ‘mutatis\r\n    mutandis’ in the eighth-century Frankish _Homilia de\r\n    Sacrilegiis_ (§§ 23-26), edited by Caspari (cf. No. xxxix,\r\n    below), and also in a MS. homily, _De Kalendis Ianuariis_, in\r\n    _Cod. Lat. Monac._ 6108 (tenth century), f. 48ᵛ. The rest of\r\n    that homily is mainly from Maximus Taurinensis, _Hom._ 16 (No.\r\n    xiv, above). And nearly the whole of the present _Sermo_ is\r\n    included in the _Homiliarium_ of Burchardus of Würzburg and\r\n    printed from his MS. by Eckart, _Francia Orientalis_, i. 837.\r\n\r\n    On the date and authorship of the _Sermo_, cf. Caspari, 67. It\r\n    is ascribed to Augustine by a _Codex Colbertinus_. His editors,\r\n    Blancpain and Coutant, treat it as not his (_a_) on account\r\n    of the difference of style, (_b_) on account of the reference\r\n    to the _ieiunium_ prescribed by the _sancti antiqui patres_\r\n    (i.e. amongst others, Augustine himself: cf. No. x). A _Codex\r\n    Aceiensis_ ascribes it to Faustinus (i.e. Faustus of Raji), and\r\n    this is accepted by the Bollandists (_Acta SS. Ian._ i. 2),\r\n    and by Eckart, _op. cit._ i. 433. Finally a _codex Navarricus_\r\n    assigns it to Maxentius. This can hardly be the Scythian monk\r\n    of that name (†520). Caspari suggests that there has been a\r\n    scribal error. The _sermo_ is headed ‘De natali Domini. In\r\n    calendis ianuariis.’ There is nothing about the Nativity in\r\n    it, and possibly a Nativity sermon and the author’s name of\r\n    the Kalends sermon which followed it have dropped out. He\r\n    also thinks Maximus Taurinensis may be meant. However Caspari\r\n    finally agrees with Blancpain and Coutant, that the style and\r\n    the allusion to the _triduum ieiunii_ so closely resembling\r\n    that of the Council of Tours (No. xxii) point to a writer of\r\n    the first half of the sixth century, and that he may very\r\n    likely be Caesarius of Arles, who, as his _Vita_ (cf. No. xx)\r\n    states, did preach against the Kalends.]\r\n\r\nDies calendarum istarum, fratres carissimi, quas Ianuarias vocant, a\r\nquodam Iano homine perdito ac sacrilego nomen accepit. Ianus autem iste\r\ndux quidam et princeps hominum paganorum fuit: quem imperiti homines\r\net rustici dum quasi regem metuunt, colere velut Deum coeperunt....\r\nDiem ergo calendarum hodiernarum de nomine Iani, sicut iam dictum est,\r\nnuncuparunt: atque ut ei homini divinos honores conferre cupiebant, et\r\nfinem unius anni et alterius initium deputarunt. Et quia apud illos\r\nIanuariae calendae unum annum implere, et alterum incipere dicebantur,\r\nistum Ianum quasi in principio ac termino posuerunt, ut unum annum\r\nimplere, alterum incipere diceretur. Et hinc est, quod idolorum cultores\r\nipsi Iano duas facies figurarunt.... Hinc itaque est quod istis diebus\r\npagani homines perverso omnium rerum ordine obscenis deformitatibus\r\nteguntur; ut tales utique se faciant qui colunt, qualis est iste qui\r\ncolitur. In istis enim diebus miseri homines, et, quod peius est, aliqui\r\nbaptizati, sumunt formas adulteras, species monstrosas, in quibus quidem\r\nsunt quae primum pudenda, aut potius dolenda sunt. Quis enim sapiens\r\npoterit credere, inveniri aliquos sanae mentis qui cervulum facientes, in\r\nferarum se velint habitum commutare? Alii vestiuntur pellibus pecudum;\r\nalii assumunt capita bestiarum, gaudentes et exsultantes, si taliter se\r\nin ferinas species transformaverint, ut homines non esse videantur....\r\nIamvero illud quale et quam turpe est, quod viri nati tunicis muliebribus\r\nvestiuntur, et turpissima demum demutatione puellaribus figuris virile\r\nrobur effeminant, non erubescentes tunicis muliebribus inserere militares\r\nlacertos: barbatas facies praeferunt, et videri feminae volunt....\r\nSunt enim qui calendis ianuariis auguria observant, ut focum de domo\r\nsua, vel aliud quodcumque beneficium, cuicumque petenti non tribuant.\r\nDiabolicas etiam strenas, et ab aliis accipiunt, et ipsi aliis tradunt.\r\nAliqui etiam rustici, mensulas in ista nocte quae praeteriit, plenas\r\nmultis rebus, quae ad manducandum sunt necessariae, componentes, tota\r\nnocte sic compositas esse volunt, credentes quod hoc illis calendae\r\nianuariae praestare possint, ut per totum annum convivia illorum in tali\r\nabundantia perseverent.... Qui enim aliquid de paganorum consuetudine in\r\nistis diebus observare voluerint, timendum est ne eis nomen christianum\r\nprodesse non possit. Et ideo sancti antiqui patres nostri considerantes\r\nmaximam partem hominum diebus istis gulae vel luxuriae deservire,\r\net ebrietatibus et sacrilegis saltationibus insanire, statuerunt\r\nin universum mundum, ut per omnes Ecclesias publicum indiceretur\r\nieiunium.... Ieiunemus ergo, fratres carissimi, in istis diebus....

The larger part of the book is from earlier Penitentials,\r\n    &c., but the long chapter from which these extracts are\r\n    taken appears to be based upon the writer’s own knowledge of\r\n    contemporary superstition.

ETHELWOLD\r\n\r\n    [The following extracts are taken from the text printed by\r\n    W. S. Logemann in _Anglia_, xiii (1891), 365, from _Cotton\r\n    MS. Tiberius A. III_, †1020-1030. This MS. has Anglo-Saxon\r\n    glosses. Other MSS. are in _Cotton MS. Faustina B. III_, and\r\n    _Bodleian MS. Junius_, 52, ii. Earlier editions of the text are\r\n    in Reyner, _De Antiquitate Ordinis Benedictinorum in Anglia_,\r\n    App. iii. p. 77, and Dugdale, _Monasticum Anglicanum_, i.\r\n    xxvii. The literary history is discussed by W. S. Logemann\r\n    in _Anglia_, xv (1893), 20; M. Bateson, _Rules for Monks\r\n    and Canons_ in _English Hist. Review_, ix (1894), 700; and\r\n    F. Tupper, _History and Texts of the Benedictine Reform of\r\n    the Tenth Century_, in _Modern Language Notes_, viii. 344.\r\n    The _Prooemium_ of the document states that it was drawn up\r\n    by the bishops, abbots, and abbesses of England upon the\r\n    suggestion of King Edgar at a Council of Winchester, and that\r\n    certain additions were made to it by Dunstan. The traditional\r\n    ascription by Cotton’s librarian and others of the authorship\r\n    of the _Regularis Concordia_ to Dunstan is probably based on\r\n    this record of the revision which, as archbishop, he naturally\r\n    gave it. The actual author is thought by Dr. Logemann, and by\r\n    Dr. Stubbs (_Memorials of Dunstan_, R. S. cx) to have been\r\n    Ælfric, a monk, first of Abingdon and then of Winchester,\r\n    who became abbot of Cerne, and in 1005 of Eynsham, and was\r\n    a considerable writer in Anglo-Saxon. Dr. Logemann’s view\r\n    is based on a theory that the _Concordia_ is the ‘Regula\r\n    Aluricii, glossata Anglice’ which occurs amongst the titles of\r\n    some tracts once in the library of Christ Church, Canterbury\r\n    (_Anglia_, xv. 25). But the _Concordia_ is more likely to have\r\n    been the ‘Consuetudines de faciendo servitio divino per annum,\r\n    glossatae Anglice,’ which is in the same list, and in fact the\r\n    Canterbury copy is probably that in _Cotton MS. Faustina, B.\r\n    III_ (_E. H. R._ ix. 708). Perhaps the ‘Regula Aluricii’ was\r\n    a copy of the letter to the monks of Eynsham, which Ælfric\r\n    at some date after 1005 based upon the _Concordia_ and the\r\n    _De Ecclesiasticis Officiis_ of Amalarius of Metz. This is\r\n    printed, from _C. C. C. C. MS._ 265, by Miss Bateson, in Dean\r\n    Kitchin’s _Obedientiary Rolls of St. Swithin’s, Winchester_,\r\n    173 (_Hampshire Record Soc._). It omits the _Sepulchrum_ and\r\n    its _Visitatio_. In any case this letter makes it clear that\r\n    Ælfric was not the author of the _Concordia_, for he says\r\n    ‘haec pauca de libro consuetudinum quem sanctus Aethelwoldus\r\n    Wintoniensis episcopus cum coepiscopis et abbatibus tempore\r\n    Eadgari felicissimi regis Anglorum undique collegit ac monachis\r\n    instituit observandum.’ The author, therefore, so far as there\r\n    was a single author, was Ethelwold, whom I take to be the\r\n    ‘abbas quidam’ of the _Prooemium_. He became Abbot of Abingdon\r\n    about 954, and Bishop of Winchester in 963. In 965 Elfrida, who\r\n    is also mentioned in the _Prooemium_, became queen. The date\r\n    of the _Concordia_ probably falls, therefore, between 965 and\r\n    the death of Edgar in 975. There were Councils of Winchester in\r\n    969 and 975 (Wilkins, i. 247, 261): but the Council at which\r\n    the _Concordia_ was undertaken may be an earlier one, not\r\n    otherwise recorded. The _Concordia_ is said in the _Prooemium_\r\n    to have been based in part upon customs of Fleury and of Ghent.\r\n    It is worth pointing out that Ethelwold had already reformed\r\n    Abingdon after the model of Fleury, and that Dunstan, during\r\n    his banishment, had found refuge in St. Peter’s at Ghent\r\n    (Stephens-Hunt, _Hist. of the English Church_, i. 347, 349).\r\n    Miss Bateson suggests that another source is to be found in the\r\n    writings of an earlier Benedictine reformer, Benedict of Aniane\r\n    (_E. H. R._ ix. 700).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_De Consuetudine Monachorum._\r\n\r\nProhemum Regularis Concordiae Anglicae Nationis Monachorum\r\nSanctimonialiumque Orditur.\r\n\r\n[The _Prooemium_ opens with an account of the piety of King Edgar ‘abbate\r\nquodam assiduo monente’ and the purification of the English monasteries.]\r\n\r\n...

THE QUIRE—THE PASSION.\r\n\r\nWithin the Abbye Church of Durham, uppon Good Friday theire was marvelous\r\nsolemne service, in the which service time, after the PASSION was sung,\r\ntwo of the eldest Monkes did take a goodly large CRUCIFIX, all of gold,\r\nof the picture of our Saviour Christ nailed uppon the crosse, lyinge\r\nuppon a velvett cushion, havinge St. Cuthbert’s armes uppon it all\r\nimbroydered with gold, bringinge that betwixt them uppon the said cushion\r\nto the lowest greeces in the Quire; and there betwixt them did hold the\r\nsaid picture of our Saviour, sittinge of every side, on ther knees, of\r\nthat, and then one of the said Monkes did rise and went a pretty way\r\nfrom it, sittinge downe uppon his knees, with his shooes put of, and\r\nverye reverently did creepe away uppon his knees unto the said Crosse,\r\nand most reverently did kisse it. And after him the other Monke did so\r\nlikewise, and then they did sitt them downe on every side of the Crosse,\r\nand holdinge it betwixt them, and after that the Prior came forth of his\r\nstall, and did sitt him downe of his knees, with his shooes off, and in\r\nlike sort did creepe also unto the said Crosse, and all the Monkes after\r\nhim one after another, in the same order, and in the mean time all the\r\nwhole quire singinge an himne. The seruice beinge ended, the two Monkes\r\ndid carrye it to the SEPULCHRE with great reverence, which Sepulchre\r\nwas sett upp in the morninge, on the north side of the Quire, nigh to\r\nthe High Altar, before the service time; and there lay it within the\r\nsaid SEPULCHRE with great devotion, with another picture of our Saviour\r\nChrist, in whose breast they did enclose, with great reverence, the most\r\nholy and blessed Sacrament of the Altar, senceinge it and prayinge unto\r\nit upon theire knees, a great space, settinge two tapers lighted before\r\nit, which tapers did burne unto Easter day in the morninge, that it was\r\ntaken forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUIRE—THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\nThere was in the Abbye Church of Duresme verye solemne service uppon\r\nEaster Day, betweene three and four of the clocke in the morninge, in\r\nhonour of the RESURRECTION, where two of the oldest Monkes of the\r\nQuire came to the Sepulchre, being sett upp upon Good Friday, after the\r\nPassion, all covered with red velvett and embrodered with gold, and\r\nthen did sence it, either Monke with a pair of silver sencers sittinge\r\non theire knees before the Sepulchre. Then they both rising came to the\r\nSepulchre, out of which, with great devotion and reverence, they tooke a\r\nmarvelous beautifull IMAGE of our SAVIOUR, representing the resurrection,\r\nwith a crosse in his hand, in the breast wherof was enclosed in bright\r\nchristall the holy Sacrament of the Altar, throughe the which christall\r\nthe Blessed Host was conspicuous to the behoulders. Then, after the\r\nelevation of the said picture, carryed by the said two Monkes uppon a\r\nfaire velvett cushion, all embrodered, singinge the anthem of _Christus\r\nresurgens_, they brought it to the High Altar, settinge that on the midst\r\ntherof, whereon it stood, the two Monkes kneelinge on theire knees before\r\nthe Altar, and senceing it all the time that the rest of the whole quire\r\nwas in singinge the foresaid anthem of _Christus resurgens_. The which\r\nanthem beinge ended, the two Monkes tooke up the cushions and the picture\r\nfrom the Altar, supportinge it betwixt them, proceeding, in procession,\r\nfrom the High Altar to the south Quire dore, where there was four antient\r\nGentlemen, belonginge to the Prior, appointed to attend theire cominge,\r\nholdinge upp a most rich CANNOPYE of purple velvett, tached round about\r\nwith redd silke and gold fringe; and at everye corner did stand one of\r\ntheise ancient Gentlemen, to beare it over the said image, with the Holy\r\nSacrament, carried by two Monkes round about the church, the whole quire\r\nwaitinge uppon it with goodly torches and great store of other lights,\r\nall singinge, rejoyceinge, and praising God most devoutly, till they came\r\nto the High Altar againe, whereon they did place the said image there to\r\nremaine untill the Ascension day.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 26. THE SOUTH ALLEY OF THE LANTERN.\r\n\r\nOver the [second of the iij Alters in that plage] was a merveylous\r\nlyvelye and bewtiful Immage of the picture of our Ladie, so called the\r\nLADY OF BOULTONE, which picture was maide to open with gymmers from her\r\nbreaste downdward. And within the said immage was wrowghte and pictured\r\nthe immage of our Saviour, merveylouse fynlie gilted, houldinge uppe his\r\nhandes, and houlding betwixt his handes a fair large CRUCIFIX OF CHRIST,\r\nall of gold, the which crucifix was to be taiken fourthe every Good\r\nFridaie, and every man did crepe unto it that was in that church at that\r\ndaye.

Deschamps de Pas to the _Annales\r\n    archéologiques_, xvii (1857), 167.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSequuntur ceremonie et modus observandus pro celebratione misse MISSUS\r\nEST GABRIEL ANGELUS, &c., vulgariter dicte AUREE MISSE quolibet anno in\r\nchoro ecclesie Tornacensis decantande feria xᵃ ante festum nativitatis\r\nDomini nostri Iesu-Christi, ex fundatione venerabilis viri magistri Petri\r\nCotrel, canonici dicti ecclesie Tornacensis et in eadem archidiaconi\r\nBrugensis, de licentia et permissione dominorum suorum decani et capituli\r\npredicte ecclesie Tomacensis.—Primo, feria tercia, post decantationem\r\nvesperum, disponentur per carpentatorem ecclesie in sacrario chori\r\ndicte ecclesie Tornacensis, in locis iam ad hoc ordinatis et sibi\r\noppositis, duo stallagia, propter hoc appropriata, que etiam ornabuntur\r\ncortinis et pannis cericeis ad hoc ordinatis per casularium iam dicte\r\necclesie, quorum alterum, videlicet quod erit de latere episcopi,\r\nserviet ad recipiendam beatam virginem Mariam, et alterum stallagium\r\nab illo oratorio oppositum, quod erit de latere decani, serviat ad\r\nrecipiendum et recludendum Angelum.—Item similiter eodem die deputatus\r\nad descendendum die sequenti columbam, visitabit tabernaculum in altis\r\ncarolis dispositum, disponet cordas, et parabit instrumentum candelis\r\nsuis munitum, per quod descendet Spiritus Sanctus in specie columbe,\r\ntempore decantationis ewangelii, prout postea dicetur, et erit sollicitus\r\ndescendere cordulam campanule, et illam disponere ad stallagium Angeli,\r\nad illam campanulam pulsandam suo tempore, die sequenti, prout post\r\ndicetur.—Item in crastinum durantibus matutinis, magistri cantus erunt\r\nsolliciti quod duo iuvenes, habentes voces dulces et altas, preparentur\r\nin thesauraria, hostio clauso, unus ad modum virginis seu regine, et\r\nalter ad modum angeli, quibus providebitur de ornamentis et aliis\r\nnecessariis propter hoc per fundatorem datis et ordinatis.—Item post\r\ndecantationem septime lectionis matutinarum, accedent duo iuvenes,\r\nMariam videlicet et Angelum representantes, sic parati de predicta\r\nthesauraria, ad chorum intrando per maius hostium dicti chori, duabus\r\nthedis ardentibus precedentibus: Maria videlicet per latus domini\r\nepiscopi, in manibus portans horas pulchras, et Angelus per latus domini\r\ndecani, portans in manu dextra sceptrum argenteum deauratum, et sic\r\nmorose progredientur, cum suis magistris directoribus, usque ad summum\r\naltare, ubi, genibus flexis, fundent ad Dominum orationem. Qua facta,\r\nprogredientur dicti iuvenes quilibet ad locum suum, Maria videlicet ad\r\nstallagium, de parte episcopi preparatum, cum suo magistro directore, et\r\nAngelus ad aliud stallagium de parte decani similiter preparatum, etiam\r\ncum suo alio magistro directore, et ubique cortinis clausis. Coram quibus\r\nstallagiis remanebunt predicte thede, ardentes usque ad finem misse.—Item\r\nclerici thesaurarie, durantibus octava et nona lectionibus matutinarum,\r\npreparabunt maius altare solemniter, ut in triplicibus festis, et\r\nomnes candele circumquaque chorum sacrarum de rokemes, et in corona\r\nnova existentes accendentur. Et clerici revestiarii providebunt quod\r\npresbyter, dyaconus, subdiaconus, choriste, cum pueris revestitis, sint\r\nparati, in fine hymni TE DEUM, pro missa decantanda, ita quod nulla sit\r\npausa inter finem dicti himpni TE DEUM et missam. Et in fine praedicte\r\nmisse sit paratus presbiter ebdomarius cantandi versum _Ora pro nobis_,\r\net deinde, _Deus in adiutorium_, de laudibus illas perficiendo per\r\nchorum, et in fine psalmi _De profundis_ dicendi, in fine matutinarum,\r\nmore consueto, adiungetur collecta _Adiuva nos_ pro fundatore ultra\r\ncollectam ordinariam.—Item, cum celebrans accesserit ad maius altare,\r\npro incipienda missa, et ante _Confiteor_ immediate cortine circumquaque\r\noratorium Virginis solum aperientur, ipsa Virgine attente orante et ad\r\ngenua existente suo libro aperto, super pulvinari ad hoc ordinato, Angelo\r\nadhuc semper clauso in suo stallagio remanente.—Item cum cantabitur\r\n_Gloria in Excelsis Deo_ tunc cortine stallagii, in quo erit Angelus,\r\naperientur. In quo stallagio stabit dictus Angelus erectus, tenens in\r\nmanibus suis suum sceptrum argenteum, et nichil aliud faciens, quousque\r\nfuerit tempus cantandi ewangelium, nec interim faciet Virgo aliquod\r\nsignum videndi dictum angelum, sed, submissis oculis, erit semper intenta\r\nad orationem.—Item cum appropinquarit tempus cantandi dictum ewangelium,\r\ndiaconus cum subdiacono, pueris cum candelis et cruce precedentibus,\r\nprogredientur ad locum in sacrario sibi preparatum, et cantabit\r\newangelium _Missus est Gabriel_, et etiam cantabunt partes suas Maria et\r\nAngelus, prout ordinatum et notatum est in libro ad hoc ordinato.—Item\r\ncum Angelus cantabit hec verba ewangelii, _Ave, gratia plena, Dominus\r\ntecum_, faciet tres ad Virginem salutationes; primo ad illud verbum\r\n_Ave_, humiliabit se tam capite quam corpore, post morose se elevando; et\r\nad illa verba, _gratia plena_, faciet secundam humiliationem, flectendo\r\nmediocriter genua sua, se postea relevando; et ad illa verba, _Dominus\r\ntecum_, quae cantabit cum gravitate et morose, tunc faciet terciam\r\nhumiliationem ponendo genua usque ad terram et finita clausula assurget,\r\nVirgine interim se non movente. Sed dum Maria virgo cantabit _Quomodo\r\nfiet istud_, assurget et vertet modicum faciem suam ad Angelum cum\r\ngravitate et modestia, non aliter se movendo. Et dum cantabit Angelus\r\n_Spiritus Sanctus superveniet in te_, etc., tunc Angelus vertet faciem\r\nsuam versus columbam illam ostendendo, et subito descendet ex loco in\r\naltis carolis ordinato, cum candelis in circuitu ipsius ardentibus, ante\r\nstallagium sive oratorium Virginis, ubi remanebit, usque post ultimum\r\n_Agnus Dei_, quo decantato, revertetur ad locum unde descenderat.—Item\r\nmagister cantus, qui erit in stallagio Angeli, sit valde sollicitus pro\r\npropria vice pulsare campanam in altis carolis, respondente in initio\r\newangelii, ut tunc ille qui illic erit ordinatus ad descendendum columbam\r\nsit preadvisatus et preparet omnia necessaria et candelas accendat. Et\r\nsecunda vice sit valde sollicitus pulsare dictam campanulam, ita quod\r\nprecise ad illud verbum _Spiritus Sanctus_ descendat ad Virginem columbam\r\nornatam candelis accensis, et remaneat ubi descenderit, usque ad ultimum\r\n_Agnus Dei_ decantatum, prout dictum est. Et tunc idem magister cantus\r\niterum pulsabit pro tercia vice eamdem campanulam, ut revertatur columba\r\nunde descenderit. Et sit ille disponendus vel deputandus ad descendendum\r\ndictam columbam bene preadvisatus de supra dicta triplici pulsatione et\r\nquid quilibet significabit ne sit in aliquo defectus.—Item predicti,\r\ndiaconus, Maria, et Angelus complebunt totum ewangelium in eodem tono\r\nprout cuilibet sibi competit, et ewangelio finito reponet se Maria ad\r\ngenua et orationem, et Angelus remanebit rectus, usque in finem misse,\r\nhoc excepto, quod in elevatione corporis Christi ponet se ad genua.—Item\r\npostea proficietur missa, Maria et Angelo in suis stallagiis usque in\r\nfine permanentibus.—Item missa finita, post _Ite, missa est_, Maria\r\net Angelus descendent de suis stallagiis et revertentur cum reliquiis\r\net revestitis usque ad revestiarium predictum eorum, flambellis\r\nprecedentibus. In quo revestiario presbiter celebrans cum predictis\r\nrevestitis Maria et Angelo dicet psalmum _De profundis_, prout in choro\r\ncum adiectione collecte _Adiuva_ pro fundatore.—Item fiet missa per\r\nomnia, ut in die Annunciationis dominice cum sequentia sive prosa _Mittit\r\nad virginem_, cum organis et discantu prout in triplicibus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\nSUBJECTS OF THE CYCLICAL MIRACLES\r\n\r\n    [This comparative table is based on that drawn up by Prof.\r\n    Hohlfeld in _Anglia_, xi. 241.

Magnin in\r\n    _Bibliothèque de l’École des Chartes_, i (1840), 517; A. de\r\n    Montaiglon in _L’Amateur des Livres_ (1849); A. Riese, in\r\n    _Zeits. f. d. österreich. Gymn._ xviii. 442; R. Sabbadini\r\n    (1894). The only manuscript is _B. N. Lat. MS._ 8069 of\r\n    the late tenth or early eleventh century. Various scholars\r\n    have dated the poem from the seventh to the tenth century;\r\n    Winterfeld declares for the ninth. It might have been intended\r\n    as a prologue to a Terentian revival or to a mime. The homage\r\n    paid to the _vetus poeta_ by the _delusor_ in his asides rather\r\n    suggests the former; cf.

A ‘Pagane’ in procession mentioned.\r\n\r\n_May 29, 1556._ Order for observance of statute as to Corpus Christi\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of these notices is not quite clear. Davidson,\r\n220, seems to think that there was never more than a _mystère mimé_\r\nat Candlemas. But the ‘play’ is mentioned in 1506, 1507, and 1510. I\r\nconjecture that the Passion and Nativity cycles were not merged in\r\nAberdeen. The Passion (Haliblude play) was performed, perhaps only\r\noccasionally, on Corpus Christi day; the Nativity annually, at Candlemas.\r\nThe ‘persones’ of 1442 and the ‘Pageants’ of 1505/6 are practically\r\nidentical, and would furnish a short play, with Moses and Octavian\r\nto represent the _Prophetae_, a _Stella_, and a _Presentation in the\r\nTemple_. But there was certainly also a procession in which the ‘honest\r\nsquiares’ of 1442 figured. This may have preceded the play, but it may\r\nhave been in some way introduced into it at ‘the offerand’ (of the\r\nVirgin in the Temple, or of the Magi?). The pageants in the list of 1531\r\nare such as cannot all have formed part of a connected cycle. But some\r\nof them might come from the ‘Haliblude’ play, and I take it that this\r\nlist was meant for the Corpus Christi procession only, the Candlemas\r\nprocession being still regulated by the order of 1507.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bon Accord._\r\n\r\nThe Haliblude play of 1440 was directed by the Abbot of Bon Accord. This\r\nwas the Aberdeen name for the Lord of Misrule. There are many notices of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_April 30, 1445._ Order ‘for letting and stanching of diuerse enormyteis\r\ndone in time bygane be the abbotis of this burgh, callit of bone acorde,\r\nthat in time to cum thai will giue na feis to na sic abbotis.

The\r\nchurchwardens’ accounts for the play show, besides payments for\r\nrefreshments:—\r\n\r\n‘First paid to the garnement man for garnements and propyrts and\r\nplaybooks, xxˢ.\r\n\r\nTo a minstrel and three waits of Cambridge....\r\n\r\nItem ... for setting up the stages.\r\n\r\nItem to John Beecher for painting of three Fanchoms and four Tormentors.\r\n\r\nItem to Giles Ashwell for easement of his croft to play in, iˢ.\r\n\r\nItem to John Hobarde, Brotherhood Priest, for the play book, iiˢ. viiiᵈ.’\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven neighbouring villages contributed to these expenses[757].\r\n\r\n\r\nBATH, SOMERSETSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of St. Michael’s, Bath, for 1482, include ‘pro potatione le\r\nplayers in recordacione [‘rehearsing’?] ludorum diversis vicibus,’ with\r\nother expenditure on players and properties. As one item is ‘et Iohī\r\nFowler pro cariando le tymbe a cimiterio dicto tempore ludi,’ the play\r\nwas perhaps a _Quem quaeritis_[758].\r\n\r\nChaucer’s Wife of Bath, in her husband’s absence at London during Lent,\r\nwould make her ‘visitaciouns’—\r\n\r\n  ‘To pleyes of miracles and mariages[759].’\r\n\r\n\r\nBETHERSDEN, KENT.\r\n\r\nThe churchwardens’ accounts record _ludi beatae Christinae_, in 1522. St.\r\nChristina’s day was July 24[760]. Bethersden players were at New Romney\r\nin 1508.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEVERLEY, YORKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nA thirteenth-century _continuator_ of the _Vita_ of St. John of Beverley\r\nrecords a recent (†1220) miracle done in the Minster:—\r\n\r\n‘Contigit, ut tempore quodam aestivo intra saepta polyandri ecclesiae B.\r\nIoannis, ex parte aquilonari, larvatorum, ut assolet, et verbis et actu\r\nfieret repraesentatio Dominicae resurrectionis. Confluebat ibi copiosa\r\nutriusque sexus multitudo, variis inducta votis, delectationis videlicet,\r\nseu admirationis causa, vel sancto proposito excitandae devotionis. Cum\r\nvero, prae densa vulgi adstante corona, pluribus, et praecipue statura\r\npusillis, desideratus minime pateret accessus, introierunt plurimi in\r\necclesiam; ut vel orarent, vel picturas inspicerent, vel per aliquod\r\ngenus recreationis et solatii pro hoc die taedium evitarent.’ Some\r\nboys climbed into the _triforium_, in order that, through the windows,\r\n‘liberius personarum et habitus et gestus respicerent, et earundem\r\ndialogos auditu faciliori adverterent.’ One of these fell into the\r\nchurch, but was miraculously preserved[761].\r\n\r\nThe Corpus Christi play is first mentioned in 1377. It was ‘antiqua\r\nconsuetudo’ in 1390, when an ‘ordinacio ludi Corporis Christi cum pena’\r\nwas entered in the Great Guild Book, requiring the crafts or ‘artes’ to\r\nproduce ‘ludos suos et pagentes’ under a penalty of 40_s._ The plays were\r\nheld annually, subject to an order by the oligarchical town council of\r\ntwelve _custodes_ or _gubernatores_ on St. Mark’s day. The _custodes_\r\n‘governed’ the play, and met certain general expenses. In 1423 they paid\r\nMaster Thomas Bynham, a friar preacher, for writing ‘banis’; also the\r\nwaits (‘_spiculatores_’) who accompanied the ‘banis.’ In the same year\r\nthey gave a breakfast to the Earl of Northumberland. In 1460 they put\r\nup a scaffold for their own use. Apparently the pageants and properties\r\nbelonged to them, for in 1391 they handed over to John of Arras, on\r\nbehalf of the ‘hairers,’ for his life and under surety, the necessaries\r\nfor the play of Paradise; ‘viz. j karre, viij hespis, xviij stapels,\r\nij visers, ij wenges angeli, j fir-sparr, j worme, ij paria caligarum\r\nlinearum, ij paria camisarum, j gladius.’ Otherwise the expenses were\r\nmet by the crafts, whose members paid a fixed levy towards the play,\r\nthe ‘serge’ or light maintained by the craft in some chapel, and the\r\nwooden ‘castle’ erected at the procession of St. John of Beverley on\r\nMonday in Rogation week. Thus the Barbers’ _Ordinances_ in 1414 require\r\ntheir members to pay 2_s._ and a pound of wax on setting up shop, and\r\n2_s._ on taking an apprentice. Certain fines also were in this company\r\nappropriated to the same purposes. In 1469 journeymen cappers paid 8_d._\r\nfor any year when there was a play, and 6_d._ when there was not. The\r\ntown _Ordinances_ of 1467 contemplate annual payments by all craftsmen.\r\nIn 1449 the _custodes_ contributed 4_s._ to the Skinners’ play as ‘alms\r\nof the community.’ If a craft failed to produce its play, the _custodes_\r\nexacted the whole or a part of the fine of 40_s._ specified in the\r\n_Ordinacio_ of 1390. They also levied other disciplinary fines; as on\r\nJohn ‘cordewainer’ in 1423, for hindering the play, on Henry Cowper,\r\n‘webster,’ in 1452, ‘quod nesciebat ludum suum’; on the alderman of the\r\n‘paynetors,’ in 1520-1 ‘because their play was badly and confusedly\r\nplayed, in contempt of the whole community, before many strangers’; and\r\nso forth. The order of 1390 specified thirty-eight crafts to play; ‘viz.\r\nmercers et drapers, tannatores, masons, skynners, taillors, goldsmyths,\r\nsmyths, plummers, bollers, turnors, girdelers, cutlers, latoners,\r\nbroche-makers, horners, sponers, ladilers, furburs, websters, walkers,\r\ncoverlid-wevers, cartwrightes, coupars, fletchers, bowers, cordewaners,\r\nbaksters, flesshewers, fysshers, chaundelers, barburs, vynters, sadilers,\r\nrapers, hayrers, shipmen, glovers, and workmen.’ As elsewhere, changing\r\nconditions of social life led to alterations in this list, and consequent\r\ndivisions and mergings of the plays. Thus in 1411 it seems to have been\r\nfelt as a grievance that certain well-to-do inhabitants of Beverley, who\r\nbelonged to no craft, escaped all charge for the plays, and it was agreed\r\nthat in future the ‘digniores villae’ should appoint four representatives\r\nand contribute a play. In 1493 the Drapers formed a craft of their own\r\napart from the Mercers, and consequently a play was divided, the Drapers\r\ntaking ‘Demyng Pylate,’ and leaving to the Mercers ‘Blak Herod.’ On the\r\nfly-leaf of the _Great Guild Book_ is a list of crafts and their plays,\r\ndated by Mr. Leach †1520, which differs considerably from that of 1390.\r\nIt is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Gubernacio Ludi _Corporis Christi_.\r\n\r\n      _Tylers_: the fallinge of Lucifer.\r\n      _Saddelers_: the makinge of the World.\r\n      _Walkers_: makinge of Adam and eve.\r\n      _Ropers_: the brekinge of the Comaundments of God.\r\n      _Crelers_: gravinge and Spynnynge.\r\n      _Glovers_: Cayn.\r\n      _Shermen_: Adam and Seth.\r\n      _Wattermen_: Noe Shipp.\r\n      _Bowers and Fletshers_: Abraham and Isaak.\r\n      _Musterdmakers and Chanlers_: Salutation of Our Lady.\r\n      _Husbandmen_: Bedleem.\r\n      _Vynteners_: Sheipherds.\r\n      _Goldsmyths_: Kyngs of Colan.\r\n      _Fyshers_: Symeon.\r\n      _Cowpers_: fleyinge to Egippe.\r\n      _Shomakers_: Children of Ysraell.\r\n      _Scryveners_: Disputacion in the Temple.\r\n      _Barbours_: Sent John Baptyste.\r\n      _Laborers_: the Pynnacle.\r\n      _The Mylners_: rasynge of Lazar.\r\n      _Skynners_: ierusalem.\r\n      _Bakers_: the Mawndy.\r\n      _Litsters_: prainge at the Mownte.\r\n      _Tailyours_: Slepinge Pilate.\r\n      _Marchaunts_ [i.e. _Mercers_]: Blak Herod.\r\n      _Drapers_: Demynge Pylate.\r\n      _Bocheours_: Scorgynge.\r\n      _Cutlers and Potters_: the Stedynynge.\r\n      _Wevers_: the Stanginge.\r\n      _Barkers_: the Takinge of the Crose.\r\n      _Cooks_: Haryinge of hell.\r\n      _Wrights_: the Resurrection.\r\n      _Gentylmen_: Castle of Emaut.\r\n      _Smyths_: Ascencion.\r\n      _Prestes_: Coronacion of Our Lady.\r\n      _Marchaunts_: Domesday.\r\n\r\nThe thirty-eight pageants of 1390 have become thirty-six in 1520. Besides\r\nthe ‘Gentylmen,’ dating from 1411, the ‘Prestes’ are noticeable. These\r\nare probably the ‘clerus Gildae Corporis Christi,’ who in 1430 led the\r\nCorpus Christi procession in which many of the crafts with their lights\r\ntook part. Procession and play, though on the same day, seem to have been\r\nin 1430 quite distinct. The play lasted only one day, and was given in\r\n1449 at six stations; viz. at the North Bar, by the Bull-ring, between\r\nJohn Skipworth and Robert Couke in Highgate, at the Cross Bridge, at the\r\nFishmarket (now called Wednesday Market), at the Minster Bow, and at the\r\nBeck. Poulson stated that the performances lasted into the reign of James\r\nI. Mr. Leach could find no trace of them in the municipal archives after\r\n1520[762]. But the _Ordinances_, dated 1555, of the Minstrels’ guild ‘of\r\nour Lady of the read arke’ provide that certain forfeits shall go to the\r\n‘comon place’ (which I take to be ‘common plays’) of Beverley.\r\n\r\nA second craft-play appears in 1469, when a number of crafts, thirty-nine\r\nin all, gave a Pater Noster play on the Sunday after St. Peter and\r\nVincula (August 1). Copies of the text (_registra_) were made for the\r\ncrafts. The stations were those of the Corpus Christi play. There\r\nwere eight ‘pagends’ named after the eight principal ‘lusores,’ viz.\r\n‘Pryde: Invy: Ire: Avaryce: Sleweth (also called ‘Accidie’): Glotony:\r\nLuxuria: Vicious.’ A number of crafts united to furnish each of these;\r\napparently the most important was that of ‘Vicious,’ provided by the\r\n‘gentilmen, merchands, clerks and valets.’ Aldermen of the pageants were\r\nappointed[763].\r\n\r\n\r\nBILLERICAY, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nThe Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe was twice hired by men of ‘Beleryca,’ or\r\n‘Belyrica’ during 1564-6.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOP AUCKLAND, DURHAM.\r\n\r\nThe _lusores_ of ‘Auklande’ received a present from Durham Priory for\r\nplaying before Master Hyndley, at Christmas, 1539. (App. E, i.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBOREHAM, ESSEX.\r\n\r\n‘Casse of Boreham’ hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe in 1566 and 1573,\r\nand the ‘players of Boreham,’ at Twelfth Night, 1574.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOXFORD, SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\nA play appears in the churchwardens’ accounts for 1535[764].\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAINTREE, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nThe churchwardens’ accounts of St. Michael’s include the following:—\r\n\r\n‘_Anno 1523._ A Play of Sᵗ Swythyn, acted in the Church on a Wednesday,\r\nfor which was gathered 6: 14: 11½; Pᵈ at the said Play, 3: 1: 4; due to\r\nthe Church, 3: 13: 7½.\r\n\r\n_Anno 1525._ There was a Play of Sᵗ Andrew acted in the Church the Sunday\r\nbefore Relique Sunday; Rcᵈ, 8: 9: 6; Pd, 4: 9: 9; Due to the Church, 3:\r\n19: 8.\r\n\r\n_Anno 1529._ A Play in Halstead Church.\r\n\r\n_Anno 1534._ A Play of Placidas _alias_ Sᵗ Eustace.

The plays were probably\r\nin aid of the large expenditure on the fabric of the church between 1522\r\nand 1535.\r\n\r\nThe Chelmsford (q.v.) play was given at Braintree in 1562.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRENTWOOD, ESSEX.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Johnston of Brentwoode’ hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe in 1566.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRISTOL, GLOUCESTERSHIRE.\r\n\r\nA town-clerk’s account of municipal customs, after describing the banquet\r\non St. Katharine’s Eve (Nov. 24), concludes:—\r\n\r\n‘And then to depart, euery man home: the Maire, Shiref, and the\r\nworshipfull men redy to receyue at theire dores Seynt Kateryns players,\r\nmakyng them to drynk at their dores, and rewardyng theym for theire\r\nplays[766].’ Were these plays more than a ‘catterning’ _quête_ (vol. i.\r\np. 253)?\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of plays amongst the records, including several\r\ncraft-guild ordinances, in the _Little Red Book of Bristol_ (ed. W. B.\r\nBickley, 1901). But ‘the Shipwrights Pageannt’ was used at the reception\r\nof Henry VII in 1486 (p. 175).\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOKLAND, KENT.\r\n\r\nBrookland players were at New Romney in 1494.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUNGAY, SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\nOn the night after Corpus Christi day, June 16, 1514, certain persons\r\n‘brake and threw down five pageants of the said inhabitants, that is\r\nto saye, hevyn pagent, the pagent of all the world, Paradyse pagent,\r\nBethelem pagent, and helle pagent, the whyche wer ever wont tofore to be\r\ncaryed abowt the seyd town upon the seyd daye in the honor of the blissyd\r\nSacrement.’\r\n\r\nThe churchwardens’ accounts of St. Mary’s show payments in 1526 for\r\ncopying the game-book, and to Stephen Prewett, a Norwich priest, for his\r\nlabour in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of Holy Trinity show payments: in 1558, to a man riding to\r\nYarmouth for the ‘game gear,’ ‘to William Ellys for the interlude and\r\ngame booke, iiijᵈ,’ ‘for writing the partes, ijˢ’; in 1566, on occasion\r\nof ‘the interlude in the churchyarde,’ for apparel borrowed from Lord\r\nSurrey, ‘for visors,’ and ‘to Kelsaye, the vyce, for his pastyme before\r\nthe plaie, and after the playe, both daies, ijˢ.’ In 1577, a churchwarden\r\ngave a receipt to his predecessor for ‘game pleyers gownes and coats,\r\nthat were made of certayne peces of olld copes.’ In 1591, 5_s._ was\r\nreceived for ‘players cootes[767].’\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNHAM, ESSEX.\r\n\r\n‘Wᵐ Crayford of Burnam’ hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe in 1568.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURY ST. EDMUND’S, SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\nThe _Ordinances_ of the Weavers (1477) assign half of certain fines to\r\n‘the sustentacione and mayntenaunce of the payent of the Assencione of\r\noure Lord God and of the yiftys of the Holy Gost, as yt hath be customed\r\nof olde tyme owte of mynde yeerly to be had to the wurschepe of God,\r\namongge other payenttes in the processione in the feste of Corpus Xr̄i.’\r\n\r\nJourneymen weavers are to pay ‘iiijᵈ’ yearly to the ‘payent’ and all\r\n‘foreyne’ as well as ‘deyzin’ weavers are to be contributory to it[768].\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether the ‘payent’ had a _ludus_ or was a dumb-show.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBORNE, CORNWALL.\r\n\r\nSee Texts (i), _Cornish Plays_, _St. Meriasek_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, CAMBRIDGESHIRE.\r\n\r\nWilliam de Lenne and Isabel his wife, joining the guild of Corpus Christi\r\n(†1350), spent half a mark ‘_in ludo Filiorum Israelis_[769].’\r\n\r\nWarton says:—\r\n\r\n‘The oldest notice I can recover of this sort of spectacle [Latin plays]\r\nin an English University is in the fragment of an ancient accompt-roll\r\nof the dissolved college of Michael-House in Cambridge; in which, under\r\n1386, the following expense is entered: ‘Pro ly pallio brusdato et pro\r\nsex larvis et barbis in comedia[770].’\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTERBURY, KENT.\r\n\r\nA Burghmote order (†1500) directed ‘a play called Corpus Christi play\r\n... maintained and played at the costs of the Crafts and Mysteries,’\r\nalthough ‘of late days it hath been left and laid apart,’ to be revived\r\nat Michaelmas[771].\r\n\r\nA book of the play of Abraham and Isaac, belonging to the ‘schaft’ or\r\nparochial guild of St. Dunstan’s, lay in the keeping of the churchwardens\r\nof that church from 1491 to 1520[772].\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 6, 1503, the corporation paid for a play of the _Three Kyngs of\r\nColeyn_ in the guildhall. The account mentions three ‘bests’ made of\r\nhoops and laths and painted canvas, ‘heddyng of the Hensshemen,’ a castle\r\nin the courthall, and a gilt star.\r\n\r\nAnnual accounts for ‘the pagent of St. Thomas’ on the day of his\r\nmartyrdom (Dec. 29), appear amongst the financial records of the\r\ncorporation from 1504-5 until ‘far on in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.’ I\r\nselect some items:—\r\n\r\n‘1504-5.\r\n\r\n    Paied to Sampson Carpenter and hys man hewyng and squeryng of tymber\r\n        for the Pagent.\r\n    For makyng Sᵗ Thomas Carte with a peyer of whyles.\r\n    To iiij men to helpe to cary the Pagent.\r\n    For a newe myghter.\r\n    For two bagges of leder.\r\n    For payntyng of the awbe and the hedde.\r\n    For gunpowder.\r\n    For lynnen cloth bought for Sᵗ Thomas garment.\r\n    For forgyng and makyng the knyghts harnes.\r\n    For the hyre of a sworde.\r\n    For wasshynge of an albe and an amys.’\r\n\r\n_In later years._\r\n\r\n    ‘Pro le yettyng sanguynem.\r\n    Pro le payntyng capitis Sci Thomae.\r\n    For them that holpe to dress the Pagent and for standyng of the same\r\n        in the barne.\r\n    For a payer of new gloves for Seynt Thomas.\r\n    For payntyng of the hede and the Aungell of the pagent.\r\n    Paied to hym that turned the vyce.\r\n    Paied for wyre for the vyce of the Angell.\r\n    For 1 quarter of lambe and brede and drynke gevyn to the children\r\n        that played the knyghtes, and for them that holpe to convey\r\n        the Pagent abowte.\r\n    For a new leder bag for the blode.\r\n    For wasshyng of the albe and other clothys abowte the Auter, and\r\n        settyng on agayn the apparell.’\r\n\r\nUntil 1529 the pageant stood in the barn of St. Sepulchre’s convent;\r\nthenceforward in the archbishop’s palace. In 1536-7 ‘Seynt Thomas’ became\r\n‘Bysshop Bekket,’ and the show was suppressed, to be revived with some\r\nadded ‘gyaunts’ under Mary[773].\r\n\r\nThis pageant was probably a dumb-show of the martyrdom of Becket.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHELMSFORD, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Surrey rewarded the players of ‘Chemsford’ on Dec. 27, 1490\r\n(Appendix E, vii).\r\n\r\nThe churchwardens’ accounts give minute details of a play held in 1562\r\nand 1563. The following are the chief items:—\r\n\r\n‘Inprms paid unto the Mynstrolls for the Show day and for the play day.\r\n\r\nUnto Willm. Hewet for makinge the vices coote, a fornet of borders, and a\r\nJerken of borders.\r\n\r\nTo John Lockyer for making iiij shep hoks and for iron work that Burle\r\noccupied for the hell.\r\n\r\nItem paide to Robᵗ Mathews for a pair of wombes.\r\n\r\nto Lawrence for watching in the Churche when the temple was a-dryenge.\r\n\r\nfor carrying of plonk for the stages.\r\n\r\nfor ... the scaffold.\r\n\r\nto M. Browne for the waightes of Bristowe.\r\n\r\nfor makyng the conysants.\r\n\r\nforty Mynstrells meate and drinke.\r\n\r\nto William Withers for making the frame for the heaven stage and tymber\r\nfor the same.\r\n\r\nfor writtinge.\r\n\r\nto William Withers for makynge the last temple, the waies, and his\r\npaynnes.\r\n\r\nto John Wryght for makynge a cotte of lether for Christ.\r\n\r\nto Solomon of Hatfild for parchmente.\r\n\r\nto Mother Dale and her company for reaping flagges for the scaffold.\r\n\r\nto Polter and Rosse for watching in the pightell on the play show.\r\n\r\nfor fyftie fadam of lyne for the cloudes.\r\n\r\nfor tenn men to beare the pagiante.\r\n\r\nto Browne for keapinge the cornehill on the showe daye.\r\n\r\nto Roistone for payntenge the Jeiants, the pagiante, and writing the\r\nplaiers names.\r\n\r\nfor paper to wright the Bookes.’\r\n\r\nThere are many other payments to workmen and for refreshments, and\r\nlarge sums to various people ‘for suinge the play.’ Is this ‘showing,’\r\n‘stage-managing’? One Burles, who was twice paid for ‘suinge,’ was also\r\nboarded with his boy for three weeks.\r\n\r\nAn inventory of garments made in February, 1564, includes, with many\r\nvelvet gowns and jerkins, &c.:—\r\n\r\n‘ij vyces coates, and ij scalpes, ij daggers (j dagger wanted).\r\n\r\nv prophets cappes (one wantinge).\r\n\r\niij flappes for devils.\r\n\r\niiij shepehoks, iiij whyppes (but one gone).’\r\n\r\nI infer that the play was a cyclical one, extending at least from\r\nCreation to Crucifixion. The temple, which required renewing, was\r\nprobably rent in twain. There were heaven, hell, _Prophetae_, _Pastores_.\r\nThe performance was not in the church, although the temple was put to dry\r\nthere, but in a ‘pightell’ or enclosure, upon a scaffold, with stages for\r\nthe spectators. It was held in connexion with a ‘showe,’ which was on\r\nCornhill, and to which I assign the ‘pagiante’ and ‘jeiantes.’ The time\r\nwas therefore probably Midsummer.\r\n\r\nThe accounts seem to cover two years and at least four performances. In\r\n1562, Midsummer day with its show fell on a Saturday. The play was on\r\nMonday. On Tuesday it was repeated at Braintree, and later on at Malden,\r\nand possibly elsewhere. Then in 1563 it was again given in Chelmsford at\r\nMidsummer.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditure was over £50, although, unless the forty minstrels\r\nacted, nothing was paid to actors. Against this was received ‘at the\r\nseconde play’ £17 11_s._ 3_d._, and ‘at the ij last plaies’ £19 19_s._\r\n4_d._, and £2 19_s._ was realized by letting out the garments to the\r\nmen of Sabsford in 1562 and 1563, and 16_s._ more for letting them to\r\n‘Mʳ William Peter, Knyght.’ Nor did this source of income soon close.\r\nA second inventory of 1573 shows that the garments were carefully\r\npreserved. They became a valuable stock. In 1564-6 alone the hire of them\r\nbrought in £10 14_s._ 3_d._ They were let to men of Colchester, Walden,\r\nBeleryca, Starford, Little Badow, and to ‘children of Badow.’ Further\r\nloans are noted as follows in later years:—\r\n\r\n‘Receipts, June 3, 1566.\r\n\r\n    Sabsforde men.\r\n    Casse of Boreham.\r\n    Somers of Lanchire.\r\n    Barnaby Riche of Witham.\r\n    Willᵐ Monnteyne of Colchester.\r\n    Mʳ.

As ‘John Arneway,’ ‘de Arnewey,’ ‘Hernwey,’ or ‘Harnwey’\r\nserved continuously as mayor from 1268 to 1277[775], and as no other of\r\nthe great English cycles of municipal plays can claim anything like this\r\nantiquity, it is worth while to examine the evidence pretty closely. I\r\ntherefore put the versions of the tradition in chronological order.\r\n\r\n(_a_) 1544. The following document is headed ‘The proclamation for the\r\nPlaies, newly made by William Newhall, clarke of the Pentice, the first\r\nyere of his entre.’ It is dated ‘tempore Willi Sneyde, draper, secundo\r\ntempore sui maioritatis’ [Oct. 9, 1543-1544], endorsed as made ‘opon the\r\nrode ee’ [Rood-eye], and stated on an accompanying sheet to be ‘of laten\r\ninto Englishe translated and made by the said William Newhall the yere\r\naforesaid[776].’\r\n\r\n‘For as moche as of old tyme, not only for the Augmentacon and increase\r\nof [the holy and catholick] faith of our Savyour, Jhu’ Crist, and to\r\nexort the mynds of the co’mon people to [good devotion and holsome]\r\ndoctryne thereof, but also for the co’men Welth and prosperitie of this\r\nCitie a plaie [and declaration—] and diverse stories of the bible,\r\nbegynnyng with the creacon and fall of Lucifer, and [ending with the\r\ngeneral] jugement of the World to be declared and plaied in the Witson\r\nwek, was devised [and made by one Sir] Henry Fraunces, somtyme monk of\r\nthis dissolved monastery, who obtayned and gate of Clement, then beyng\r\n[bushop of Rome, a thousand] daies of pardon, and of the Busshop of\r\nChester at that time beyng xlᵗⁱ daies of pardon graunted from thensforth\r\nto every person resortyng in pecible maner with good devocon to here\r\nand se the sayd [piaies] from tyme to tyme as oft as they shalbe plaied\r\nwithin this Citie [_and that every person disturbing the same piaies in\r\nany manner wise to be accursed by thauctoritie of the said Pope Clement\r\nbulls unto such tyme as he or they be absolved therof_ (_erased_)], which\r\npiaies were devised to the honour of God by John Arneway, then maire of\r\nthis Citie of Chester, and his brethren, and holl cominalty therof to\r\nbe brought forthe, declared and plead at the cost and charges of the\r\ncraftsmen and occupacons of the said Citie, whiche hitherunto have frome\r\ntyme to tyme used and performed the same accordingly.\r\n\r\nWherfore Maister Maire, in the Kynges name, straitly chargeth and\r\nco’mandeth that every person and persons of what estate, degre or\r\ncondicion soever he or they be, resortyng to the said piaies, do use\r\n[themselves] pecible without makyng eny assault, affrey, or other\r\ndisturbance whereby the same piaies shalbe disturbed, and that no maner\r\nperson or persons who soever he or they be do use or weare eny unlaufull\r\nwepons within the precynct of the said Citie duryng the tyme of the said\r\npiaies [_not only upon payn of cursyng by thauctoritie of the said Pope\r\nClement Bulls, but also_ (_erased_)] opon payn of enprisonment of their\r\nbodies and makyng fyne to the Kyng at Maister Maires pleasure. And God\r\nsave the Kyng and Mr. Maire, &c.[777]’\r\n\r\n(_b_) †1544-7[778]. The documents concerning the plays copied for Randle\r\nHolme out of the ‘White Book of the Pentice[779]’ are (1) a list of\r\nthe plays and the crafts producing them (cf. p. 408); (2) a note that\r\n‘On Corpus Χρi day the colliges and prestys bryng forth a play at the\r\nassentement of the Maire’; (3) a note that all the arrangements detailed\r\nare subject to alteration by the Mayor and his brethren; (4) a version,\r\nwithout heading, of Newhall’s proclamation which entirely omits the\r\nallusions to Sir Henry Fraunces and the pardons, while retaining that to\r\nArneway; (5) verses headed ‘The comen bannes to be proclaymed and Ryddon\r\nwith the Stewardys of every occupacon.’ These are printed in Morris, 307.\r\nThey give a list of the plays (cf. p. 408), and add that there will be\r\na ‘solempne procession’ with the sacrament on Corpus Christi day from\r\n‘Saynt Maries on the Hill’ to ‘Saynt Johns,’ together with ‘a play sett\r\nforth by the clergye In honor of the fest.’ The passage referring to\r\nCorpus Christi is marked by Randle Holme’s copyist as ‘Erased in the\r\nBooke[780].’ The only historical statement in the Banns is that\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir John Arnway was maire of this citie\r\n  When these playes were begon truly.’\r\n\r\n(_c_) †1551-1572. The later Banns, given most fully in Rogers’s\r\n_Breauarye of Chester_ (cf. Furnivall, xx), but also more or less\r\nimperfectly in MSS. _h_ and _B_ of the plays (Deimling, i. 2), were\r\nprobably written for one or other of the post-Reformation performances,\r\nbut not that of 1575, as they contemplate a Whitsun performance, while\r\nthat of 1575 was after Midsummer. They state that\r\n\r\n  ‘some tymes there was mayor of this Citie\r\n  Sir John Arnway, Knyght, who most worthilye\r\n  contented hym selfe to sett out in playe\r\n  The devise of one done Rondall, moonke of Chester abbe.’\r\n\r\n(_d_) 1609. The _Breauarye_ itself, in an account probably due to the\r\nelder Rogers, who may have himself seen some of the later performances,\r\nsays (Furnivall, xviii):—‘Heare note that these playes of Chester called\r\nyᵉ whitson playes weare the woorke of one Rondoll, a monke of yᵉ Abbaye\r\nof Sᵗ Warburge in Chester, who redused yᵉ whole history of the byble\r\ninto Englishe storyes in metter, in yᵉ englishe tounge; and this moncke,\r\nin a good desire to doe good, published yᵉ same, then the firste mayor\r\nof Chester, namely Sir Iohn Arneway, Knighte, he caused the same to be\r\nplayed [“anno domini, 1329”][781].’ In a list of Mayors contained in the\r\nsame MS. is given (Furnivall, xxv), under the year 1328 and the mayoralty\r\nof Sir John Arneway, ‘The whitson playes Inuented, in Chester, by one\r\nRondoll Higden, a monke in Chester abbaye.’\r\n\r\n(_e_) 1628. On the cover of MS. _H_ of the plays (_Harl. MS._ 2124) is\r\nthis note:—‘The Whitsun playes first made by one Don Randle Heggenet, a\r\nMonke of Chester Abbey, who was thrise at Rome, before he could obtain\r\nleaue of the Pope to haue them in the English tongue.\r\n\r\nThe Whitsun playes were playd openly in pageants by the Cittizens of\r\nChester in the Whitsun Weeke.\r\n\r\nNicholas the fift Then was Pope in the year of our Lord 1447.\r\n\r\n                             Ano 1628.\r\n\r\nSir Henry ffrancis, sometyme a Monke of the Monestery of Chester,\r\nobtained of Pope Clemens a thousand daies of pardon, and of the Bishop\r\nof Chester 40 dayes pardon for every person that resorted peaceably to\r\nsee the same playes, and that every person that disturbed the same, to\r\nbe accursed by the said Pope untill such tyme as they should be absolued\r\ntherof.’\r\n\r\n(_f_) 1669. Randle Holme made a note upon his copy of the ‘White Book of\r\nthe Pentice’ (_Harl._ 2150, f. 86ᵇ), of the ‘Whitson plaies ... being\r\nfirst presented and putt into English by Rand. Higden, a monck of Chester\r\nAbbey.’\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Seventeenth century._ A ‘later hand’ added to the copy of\r\nNewhall’s proclamation on the fly-leaf of MS. _h_ (1600) of the plays:\r\n\r\n‘Sir Io Arnway, maior 1327 and 1328, at which tyme these playes were\r\nwritten by Randall Higgenett, a monk of chester abby, and played openly\r\nin the witson weeke.’\r\n\r\n(_h_) _Seventeenth century._ An account of the plays amongst Lord De\r\nTabley’s MSS.[782] assigns them to ‘Randall Higden, a monk of Chester\r\nAbbey, A. D. 1269.’\r\n\r\nUp to a certain point these fragments of tradition are consistent and,\r\n_a priori_, not improbable. About 1328 is just the sort of date to which\r\none would look for the formation of a craft-cycle. Randall or Randulf\r\nHigden[783], the author of the _Polychronicon_, took the vows at St.\r\nWerburgh’s in 1299 and died in 1364. An accident makes it possible also\r\nto identify Sir Henry Francis, for he is mentioned as senior monk of\r\nChester Abbey in two documents of May 5, 1377, and April 17, 1382.[784]\r\nThe occurrence of the name of this quite obscure person in a tradition\r\nof some 200 years later is, I think, evidence that it is not wholly an\r\nunfounded one. It is true that Newhall’s proclamation states that Francis\r\n‘devised and made’ the plays, whereas the Banns of 1575 and the later\r\naccounts assign the ‘devise’ to ‘done Rondall.’ But this discrepancy\r\nseems to have afforded no difficulty to the writer of 1628, who clearly\r\nthought that Heggenet ‘made’ the plays, and Francis obtained the ‘pardon’\r\nfor them. The Pope Clement concerned is probably Clement VI (1342-52),\r\nbut might be the Antipope Clement VII (1378-94). The one point which\r\nwill not harmonize with the rest is that about which, unfortunately, the\r\ntradition is most uniform, namely, the connexion of the plays with the\r\nmayoralty of Sir John Arneway. For neither Higden nor Francis could have\r\nworked for a mayor whose terms of office extended from 1268 to 1277. But\r\neven this difficulty does not appear to be insoluble. I find from Canon\r\nMorris’s invaluable volume that a later mayor bearing a name very similar\r\nto Arneway’s, one Richard Erneis or Herneys, was in office from 1327\r\nto 1329, precisely at the date to which the tradition, in some of its\r\nforms, ascribes the plays. Is it not then probable that to this Richard\r\nHerneys the establishment of the plays is really due, and that he has\r\nbeen confused in the memory of Chester with his greater predecessor, the\r\n‘Dick Whittington’ of the city, John Arneway or Hernwey? I am glad to be\r\nthe means of restoring to him his long withheld tribute of esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Records._\r\n\r\nIf the plays were actually established in 1327-9, the first hundred\r\nyears of their history is a blank. The earliest notice in any record is\r\nin 1462, when the Bakers’ charter refers to their ‘play and light of\r\nCorpus Christi.’ The Saddlers’ charter of 1471 similarly speaks of their\r\n‘paginae luminis et ludi corporis Christi[785].’ It will be observed\r\nthat the play is here called a Corpus Christi play. The term ‘Whitson\r\nPlaye’ first occurs in a record of 1520[786], but there is no doubt that\r\nduring the sixteenth century the regular season for the performances was\r\nWhitsuntide. As the ‘White Book’ (†1544) still speaks of ‘pagyns in play\r\nof Corpus Χρi[787],’ it is possible that a cyclical play was so called,\r\nwhether actually given on Corpus Christi day or not. It is also, I think,\r\npossible that the Chester plays may have been transferred from Corpus\r\nChristi to Whitsuntide in order to avoid clashing with the procession,\r\nwithout quite losing their old name; and this may be what is meant by\r\nthe statement on the cover of MS. ‘H’ of the plays that they were ‘playd\r\nopenly ... in the Whitsun Weeke’ in 1447. It was in 1426 that a question\r\nas to the clashing of procession and plays arose in York (cf. p. 400).\r\n\r\nNearly all the extant notices of the plays belong to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Originally annual, they became occasional at the Reformation.\r\nThey can be traced in 1546, 1551, 1554, 1561, 1567 (at Christmas), 1568,\r\n1569, 1572, and 1575. The two last performances aroused considerable\r\nopposition. In 1572 Mayor John Hankey ‘would needs have the playes\r\ngo forward, against the wills of the Bishops of Canterbury, York and\r\nChester.’ Apparently an inhibition was sent by Archbishop Grindal; ‘but\r\nit came too late.’ In 1575, under Mayor Sir John Savage, the plays\r\nwere subjected to revision, and such of them as were thought suitable\r\ngiven ‘at the cost of the inhabitants’ on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and\r\nWednesday after Midsummer. This performance was ‘to the great dislike\r\nof many, because the playe was in on parte of the Citty.’ It was also\r\nin direct contravention of inhibitions from the Archbishop and the\r\nEarl of Huntingdon. As a result both Hankey and Savage were cited\r\nbefore the Privy Council, but the aldermen and common council took the\r\nresponsibility upon themselves, and apparently nothing further came of\r\nthe matter[788].\r\n\r\nProbably 1575 was the last year in which the plays were given as a whole.\r\nA performance in 1600 has been alleged[789], but this date is probably\r\ntaken from the heading of the Banns in MS. ‘h’ of the plays, which runs:—\r\n\r\n                  ‘The reading of the banes, 1600.\r\n\r\n    The banes which are reade Beefore the beginning of the playes\r\n    of Chester 1600.\r\n\r\n                           4 June 1600.’\r\n\r\nDoubtless 1600 is the date of the transcript, as it is repeated after\r\nthe signature to several of the plays. It is quite possible that this\r\nmanuscript was made in view of an intended performance. George Bellin,\r\nthe scribe, seems to have been of a Chester family. But if so, the\r\nintention was frustrated, for the annalists declare that Henry Hardware,\r\nmayor in 1600 ‘would not suffer any Playes.’ It is to be noted also that\r\nDavid Rogers, whose _Breauarye_ was completed in 1609 and certainly\r\ncontains matter subsequent to the death of his father in 1595, states\r\nthat 1575 was the last time the plays were played[790].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mode of Performance._\r\n\r\nThe Banns were proclaimed on St. George’s day by the city crier, with\r\nwhom rode the Stewards of each craft. The Mayor’s proclamation against\r\ndisturbers of the peace was read upon the Roodee. The plays themselves\r\nlasted through the first three week-days of Whitsuntide. Nine were given\r\non the Monday, nine on the Tuesday, and seven on the Wednesday. The first\r\nstation was at the Abbey gates, the next by the pentice at the high cross\r\nbefore the Mayor, others in Watergate Street, Bridge Street, and so on\r\nto Eastgate Street. Scaffolds and stages were put up to accommodate the\r\nspectators, and in 1528 a law-suit is recorded about the right to a\r\n‘mansion, Rowme, or Place for the Whydson plaies.’ Rogers describes the\r\n‘pagiente’ or ‘cariage’ as\r\n\r\n    ‘a highe place made like a howse with ij rowmes, being open\r\n    on yᵉ tope: the lower rowme they apparrelled & dressed them\r\n    selues; and in the higher rowme they played; and they stood\r\n    vpon 6 wheeles [_Harl._ 1944. It is “4 wheeles” in _Harl._\r\n    1948].’\r\n\r\nThe term ‘pageant’ is used at Chester both for the vehicle and for the\r\nplay performed on it; but, contrary to the custom elsewhere, more usually\r\nfor the latter. The vehicle is generally called a ‘carriage.’ It was kept\r\nin a ‘caryadghouse’ and occasionally served two crafts on different days.\r\nThe expenses of carriage, porters, refreshments, actors, and rehearsals\r\nfell, as shown by the extant _Accounts_ of the Smiths’ company, on\r\nthe crafts. They were met by a levy upon each member and journeyman.\r\nVestments were hired from the clergy; both minstrels and choristers\r\nwere in request for songs and music. The Corporation supervised the\r\nperformances, questions as to the incidence of the burden upon this or\r\nthat craft coming before the Pentice court. In 1575 the Smiths submitted\r\ntwo alternative plays for the choice of the aldermen. The authoritative\r\ncopy or ‘originall booke’ of the plays seems to have belonged to the\r\ncity. The Smiths paid for reading the ‘Regenall,’ ‘an Rygynall’ or\r\n‘orraginall.’ In 1568 one ‘Randall Trevor, gent.’ seems to have lost the\r\nbook. There is an interesting allusion to the unprofessional quality of\r\nthe actors, in the copy of the later Banns preserved by Rogers. The plays\r\nare not\r\n\r\n                                            ‘contryued\r\n  In such sorte & cunninge, & by such playeres of price,\r\n  As at this day good playeres & fine wittes coulde devise,\r\n  ...\r\n  By Craftes men & meane men these Pageauntes are played\r\n  And to Commons and Contryemen acustomablye before.\r\n  If better men & finer heades now come, what canne be saide?\r\n  But of common and contrye playeres take thou the storye;\r\n  And if any disdaine, then open is yᵉ doore\r\n  That lett him in to heare; packe awaye at his pleasure;\r\n  Oure playeinge is not to gett fame or treasure[791].’\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exceptional Performances._\r\n\r\nIn 1567 ‘Richard Dutton, mayor, kept a very worthy house for all comers\r\nall the tyme of Christmas with a Lorde of Misrule and other pastymes in\r\nthis city as the Whitson Plays.’\r\n\r\nSingle plays from the cycle were similarly used for purposes of special\r\nentertainment. In 1488 was the _Assumption_ before Lord Strange at the\r\nHigh Cross; in 1497 the _Assumption_ before Prince Arthur at the Abbey\r\ngates and the High Cross; in 1515 the _Assumption_ again together with\r\nthe _Shepherds’_ play in St. John’s churchyard. In 1576, the Smiths had\r\n‘our plas’ (the _Purification_) ‘at Alderman Mountford’s on Midsomer\r\nEve.’ Finally, in 1578, Thomas Bellin, mayor, caused the Shepherds’ play\r\n‘and other triumphs’ to be played at the high cross on the Roodee before\r\nthe Earl of Derby, Lord Strange, and others[792].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other plays._\r\n\r\nThe play by the ‘colliges and prestys’ on Corpus Christi day mentioned in\r\nthe ‘White Book’ and in the ‘Banes’ preserved therein has already been\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nIn 1529 _King Robert of Sicily_ was shown at the High Cross. This is\r\ndoubtless the play on the same subject referred to in a fragmentary\r\nletter to some ‘Lordshypp’ among the State Papers as to be played on St.\r\nPeter’s day at the cost of some of the companies. It was said to be ‘not\r\nnewe at thys time, but hath bin before shewen, evyn as longe agoe as the\r\nreygne of his highnes most gratious father of blyssyd memorye, and yt was\r\npenned by a godly clerke.’\r\n\r\nIn 1563 ‘upon the Sunday after Midsommer day, the History of _Eneas_\r\nand Queen _Dido_ was play’d in the _Roods Eye_. And were set out by one\r\n_William Croston_, gent. and one Mr. _Man_, on which Triumph there was\r\nmade two Forts, and shipping on the Water, besides many horsemen well\r\narmed and appointed.’\r\n\r\nThe entertainment of Lords Derby and Strange by Thomas Bellin in 1578\r\nincluded a ‘comedy’ by the ‘scollers of the freescole’ at the mayor’s\r\nhouse. Was this theatrical mayor a relative of George Bellin, the scribe\r\nof MSS. ‘W’ and ‘h’ of the Chester plays?\r\n\r\nIn 1589 _King Ebranke with all his Sons_ was shown before the Earl of\r\nDerby at the High Cross[793].\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Midsummer Show._\r\n\r\nThis was doubtless in its origin a folk procession. Traditionally, it\r\nwas founded in 1498 and only went in years when there were no Whitsun\r\nplays. The crafts were represented by personages out of their plays,\r\n‘the Doctors and little God’ riding for the Smiths, the Devil for the\r\nButchers, Abraham and Isaac for the Barbers, Balaam and his Ass for the\r\nBricklayers, and so forth. It does not appear that the ‘carriages’ were\r\nhad out. Other features of the ‘Show’ were four giants, an elephant and\r\ncastle, an unicorn, a camel, a luce, an antelope, a dragon with six\r\nnaked boys beating at it, morris-dancers, the ‘Mayor’s Mount’ and the\r\n‘Merchants’ Mount,’ the latter being of the nature of a hobby-ship. In\r\n1600, Mayor Henry Hardware, a ‘godly zealous man,’ would not let the\r\n‘Graull’ go at Midsummer Watch, but instead a man in white armour. He\r\nsuppressed also ‘the divill in his fethers,’ a man in woman’s clothes\r\nwith another devil called ‘cuppes and cans,’ ‘god in stringes,’ the\r\ndragon and the naked boys, and had the giants broken up. But next year\r\nthe old customs were restored. The Midsummer Show again suffered eclipse\r\nunder the Commonwealth, but was revived at the Restoration and endured\r\nuntil 1678[794].\r\n\r\n\r\nCOGGESHALL, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nLord Howard rewarded the players of ‘Kokesale’ or ‘Coksale’ on Dec. 26,\r\n1481, and Dec. 25, 1482 (Appendix E, vii).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLCHESTER, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nThe Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe was twice hired by Colchester men during\r\n1564-6; also by William Monnteyne of Colchester in 1566.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLESHILL, WARWICKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe ‘lusores de Coleshille’ played at Maxstoke Priory between 1422 and\r\n1461 (Appendix E, ii).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVENTRY, WARWICKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n    [_Authorities._—The facts are taken, where no other reference\r\n    is given, from T. Sharp, _A Dissertation on the Pageants or\r\n    Dramatic Mysteries Anciently Performed at Coventry_ (1825), and\r\n    J. B. Gracie, _The Weavers’ Pageant_ (1836: Abbotsford Club).\r\n    The latter accounts of J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines of\r\n    the Life of Shakespeare_ (ninth edition, 1890), i. 335, ii.\r\n    289, and M. D. Harris, _Life in an Old English Town_, 319, add\r\n    a little. The _Leet-Book_ and other municipal archives used\r\n    by Sharp are described by Harris, 377; his private collection\r\n    passed into that of Mr. Staunton at Longbridge House, and\r\n    thence into the Shakespeare Memorial Library at Birmingham,\r\n    where it was burnt in 1879. It included two craft-plays, the\r\n    account-books of the Smiths, Cappers, Drapers, and Weavers, and\r\n    one or two MSS. (one of which is referred to as ‘Codex Hales’)\r\n    of a set of brief local seventeenth-century _Annales_, of which\r\n    other texts are printed by Dugdale, _Hist. of Warwickshire_, i.\r\n    147, and Hearne, _Fordun’s Scotichronicon_, v. 1438. Several\r\n    versions of these _Annales_ are amongst the manuscripts of the\r\n    Coventry Corporation (cf. E. S. Hartland, _Science of Fairy\r\n    Tales_, 75). On their nature, cf. C. Gross, _Bibl. of Municipal\r\n    History_, xviii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corpus Christi Craft-Plays._\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice is a mention of the ‘domum pro le pagent pannarum’ in\r\na deed of 1392. There must therefore be an error, so far as the pageants\r\ngo, in the statement of the _Annals_, under the mayoral year 1416-7,\r\n‘The pageants and Hox tuesday invented, wherein the king and nobles took\r\ngreat delight[795].’ Henry V was more than once at Coventry as prince,\r\nin 1404 for example, and in 1411. His only recorded visit as king was in\r\n1421, too early for Corpus Christi or even Hox Tuesday[796]. There is\r\nfrequent reference to the plays in corporation and craft documents of\r\nthe fifteenth century. In 1457 they were seen by Queen Margaret, who\r\n‘lodged at Richard Wodes, the grocer,’ whither the corporation sent an\r\nelegant collation, including ‘ij cofyns of counfetys and a pot of grene\r\ngynger.’ With her were the Duke and Duchess of Buckingham, Lord and Lady\r\nRivers, the elder and younger Lady of Shrewsbury, and ‘other mony moo\r\nlordes and ladyes.’ They were seen also by Richard III in 1485 and twice\r\nby Henry VII. The first occasion was on St. Peter’s day (June 29) in\r\n1486, and the second in 1493, when say the _Annals_, rather oddly (cf.\r\np. 420), ‘This yeare the King came to se the playes acted by the Gray\r\nFriers, and much commended them.’ In 1520 the _Annals_ record ‘New playes\r\nat Corpus Christi tyde, which were greatly commended.’ In 1539 the mayor\r\nof Coventry, writing to Cromwell, told him that the poor commoners were\r\nat such expense with their plays and pageants that they fared the worse\r\nall the year after[797]. In the sixteenth century the Coventry plays\r\nwere probably the most famous in England. The _C. Mery Talys_ (1526)\r\nhas a story of a preacher, who wound up a sermon on the Creed with ‘Yf\r\nyou beleue not me then for a more suerte & suffycyent auctoryte go your\r\nway to Couentre and there ye shall se them all playd in Corpus Cristi\r\nplaye[798].’ And John Heywood, in his _Foure PP_, speaks of one who\r\n\r\n      ‘Oft in the play of Corpus Cristi\r\n  He had played the deuyll at Couentry[799].’\r\n\r\nFoxe, the martyrologist, records that in 1553 John Careless, in Coventry\r\ngaol for conscience sake, was let out to play in the pageant about the\r\ncity. There is some confusion here, as Careless was only in gaol in\r\nCoventry for a short time in November before he was sent to London[800].\r\n\r\nWhen the _Annals_ say that in 1575-6 ‘the Pageants on Hox Tuesday that\r\nhad been laid down eight years were played again,’ there is probably some\r\nconfusion between ‘Hox Tuesday’ and ‘the Pageants,’ for the account-books\r\nshow that the latter were played regularly, except in 1575, until 1580,\r\nwhen the _Annals_ report them as ‘again laid down.’ In 1584 a different\r\nplay was given (cf. _infra_), and possibly also in 1591, although the\r\nfact that the songs of the Taylors and Shearmen’s pageant are dated 1591\r\nrather suggests that after all the regular plays may have been revived\r\nthat year. Some of the pageants were sold in 1586 and 1587, but the\r\nCappers preserved the properties of their play in 1597, and the Weavers\r\nhad still players’ apparel to lend in 1607. According to the _Annals_, by\r\n1628 the pageants had ‘bine put downe many yeares since.’\r\n\r\nThe plays were given annually and in one day at the feast of Corpus\r\nChristi. Contrary to the custom of the northern towns, there were only\r\nsome ten or twelve pageants, each covering a fairly wide range of\r\nincident (cf. p. 423). Nor can the performances be shown to have been\r\nrepeated at more than three or four stations. ‘Gosford Street,’ ‘Mikel’\r\nor ‘Much Park Street end’ and ‘Newgate’ are recorded, and in one of these\r\nmay have been the house of Richard Wodes, where Queen Margaret lay. The\r\nDrapers only provided three ‘worlds’ for their pageant, and probably\r\none was burnt at each station. According to the _Annals_, part of the\r\ncharges of the plays was met by the enclosure of a piece of common land\r\n(possibly to build pageant houses upon). Otherwise they fell wholly upon\r\nthe crafts, to some one of which every artisan in the town was bound to\r\nbecome contributory for the purpose. The principal crafts were appointed\r\nby the Leet to produce the pageants, and with each were grouped minor\r\nbodies liable only for fixed sums, varying from 3_s._ 4_d._ to 16_s._\r\n8_d._ In 1501 an outside craft, the Tilemakers of Stoke, is found\r\ncontributing 5_s._ to a pageant. These combinations of crafts varied\r\nconsiderably from time to time. Within the craft the necessary funds were\r\nraised, in part at least, by special levies. Strangers taking out their\r\nfreedom were sometimes called upon for a contribution. Every member of\r\nthe craft paid his ‘pagent pencys.’ In several crafts the levy was 1_s._\r\nAmongst the Smiths it must have been less, as they only got from 2_s._\r\n2_d._ to 3_s._ 4_d._ in this way, whereas the Cappers in 1562 collected\r\n22_s._ 4_d._ In 1517 William Pisford left a scarlet and a crimson gown to\r\nthe Tanners for their play, together with 3_s._ 4_d._ to each craft that\r\nfound a pageant. The total cost of the Smiths’ play in 1490 was £3 7_s._\r\n5½_d._ In 1453 we find the Smiths contracting with one Thomas Colclow\r\nto have ‘the rewle of the pajaunt’ for twelve years, and to produce the\r\nplay for a payment of 46_s._ 8_d._ A similar contract was made in 1481.\r\nBut as a rule, the crafts undertook the management themselves, and the\r\naccount-books studied by Sharp afford more detailed information as to\r\nthe mode of production than happens to be available for any other of the\r\ngreat cycles.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore worth while to give some account of the chief objects of\r\nexpenditure. First of all there was the pageant itself. The name appears\r\nin every possible variety of spelling in Coventry documents. Dugdale,\r\non the authority of eye-witnesses, describes the pageants as ‘Theaters\r\nfor the severall Scenes, very large and high, placed upon wheels.’\r\nPainted cloths were used ‘to lap aboubt the pajent,’ and there was a\r\ncarved and painted top, adorned with a crest, with vanes, pencils, or\r\nstreamers. On the platform of the pageant such simple scenic apparatus\r\nas a seat for Pilate, a pillar for the scourging, a ‘sepulchre,’ and the\r\nlike, was fixed. The Weavers’ pageant seems to have had an ‘upper part’\r\nrepresenting the Temple; also divisions described in the stage directions\r\nas ‘the for pagand’ and ‘the tempull warde.’ The Cappers’ pageant was\r\nfitted up with a ‘hell-mouth.’ The Drapers also had a ‘hell-mouth,’ with\r\na windlass, and fire at the mouth, and a barrel for the earthquake, and\r\nthree worlds to be set afire. ‘Scaffolds,’ distinct from the pageant\r\nitself, were drawn round with it. These, according to Sharp, were for\r\nspectators, but they may have been supplementary stages, made necessary\r\nby the number of episodes in each play at Coventry. Certainly the action\r\nwas not wholly confined to the pageant, for in the Shearmen and Taylors’\r\nplay, ‘Here Erode ragis in the pagond & in the strete also’; and again,\r\n‘the iij Kyngis speykyth in the strete.’ The pageant was constantly in\r\nneed of repairs. A pageant-house had to be built or hired for it. On\r\nthe day of the feast it was cleaned, strewn with rushes; and the axle\r\nwas greased with soap. Men were paid to ‘drive’ or ‘horse’ it, and the\r\nCappers expected their journeymen to undertake this job.\r\n\r\nThe players received payments varying with the importance of their parts.\r\nThe sums allowed by the Weavers in 1525 ranged from 10_d._ to 2_s._ 4_d._\r\nMinstrels, both vocalists and instrumentalists, were also hired, and in\r\n1573 one Fawston, evidently an artist of exceptional talent, received\r\nfrom the Smiths, besides 4_d._ ‘for hangyng Judas,’ another 4_d._ ‘for\r\nCoc croyng.’ The Drapers paid as much as 3_s._ 4_d._ ‘for pleayng God,’\r\nand 5_s._ ‘to iij whyte sollys’ or ‘savyd sowles,’ 5_s._ ‘to iij blake\r\nsollys,’ or ‘dampnyd sowles,’ 16_d._ ‘to ij wormes of conscyence,’ and\r\nthe like. Payments also occur for speaking the prologue, preface, or\r\n‘protestacyon.’\r\n\r\nThe corporation exercised control over the players, and in 1440 ordered\r\nunder a penalty of 20_s._ ‘quod Robertus Gñe et omnes alii qui ludunt\r\nin festo Corporis Christi bene et sufficienter ludant ita quod nulla\r\nimpedicio fiat in aliquo ioco.’ In 1443, an order forbade members of\r\ncertain crafts to play in any pageant except their own without the\r\nmayor’s licence.\r\n\r\nThe players required refreshment at intervals during the day, and\r\nprobably the craftsmen who attended the pageant took their share. Further\r\nexpenses, both for refreshment, and for the hire of a room or hall, were\r\nincurred at rehearsals. The Smiths in 1490 had their first ‘reherse’ in\r\nEaster week, and their second in Whitsun week.\r\n\r\nEach craft had its own ‘orygynall’ or ‘play-boke,’ and paid for making\r\nthe necessary copies, for setting or ‘pricking’ songs, for ‘beryng of ye\r\nOrygynall’ or prompting, and occasionally for bringing the text up to\r\ndate. Thus the Smiths had a ‘new rygenale’ in 1491, and in 1573 a ‘new\r\nplay,’ by which is apparently meant an additional scene to their existing\r\nplay (cf. p. 423). The Drapers added ‘the matter of the castell of\r\nEmaus’ in 1540. The Weavers paid 5_s._ ‘for makyng of the play boke’ in\r\n1535, and the colophon of their extant text shows it to have been ‘newly\r\ntranslate’ in that year by Robert Croo. This was a regular theatrical\r\nman of all work. The matter of the Shearmen and Taylors’ play was ‘nevly\r\ncorrecte’ by him in the same year. In 1557 he got 20_s._ from the Drapers\r\n‘for makyng of the boke for the paggen.’ The Smiths paid him in 1563 ‘for\r\nij leves of our pley boke.’ And between 1556 and 1562 he further assisted\r\nthe Drapers, by playing God, mending the ‘devells cottes,’ supplying a\r\nhat for the Pharisee, and manufacturing the requisite ‘iij worldys.’\r\n\r\nFinally, there was the not inconsiderable cost of costumes and\r\nproperties, including the gloves for the performers which figure so\r\ninvariably in mediaeval balance sheets. Further details as to these and\r\nall other objects of expenditure than I have here room for will be found\r\nin the invaluable volumes of Mr. Sharp.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Destruction of Jerusalem._\r\n\r\nIn 1584, four years after the ordinary Corpus Christi plays were laid\r\ndown, the _Annals_ record ‘This year the new Play of the Destruction of\r\nJerusalem was first played.’ This is confirmed by the accounts of the\r\ncorporation, which include a sum of £13 6_s._ 8_d._ ‘paid to Mr. Smythe\r\nof Oxford the xvᵗʰ daye of Aprill 1584 for hys paynes for writing of\r\nthe tragedye.’ This was one John Smythe, a scholar of the Free School\r\nin Coventry and afterwards of St. John’s College, Oxford. The play was\r\nproduced at considerable expense upon the pageants of the crafts, but\r\nthe day of performance is not stated. From the detailed accounts of the\r\nSmiths and the Cappers, Mr. Sharp infers that it was based upon the\r\nnarrative of Josephus.\r\n\r\nIn 1591, the old Corpus Christi plays seem to have been proposed for\r\nexhibition, as the MS. of the Shearmen and Taylors’ songs bears the date\r\nof May 13 in that year. But on May 19 the corporation resolved ‘that the\r\ndestruction of Jerusalem, the Conquest of the Danes, or the historie of\r\nK[ing] E[dward] the X [Confessor], at the request of the Comons of this\r\nCittie shal be plaied on the pagens on Midsomer daye & St. Peters daye\r\nnext in this Cittie & non other playes.’ The two last-named plays may\r\nhave been inspired by the traditional interpretations of the Hox Tuesday\r\ncustom (cf. vol. i. p. 154). Which was chosen does not appear; but some\r\nperformance or other was given. Several of the crafts had by this time\r\nsold their pageants. Those who had not lent them; and all compounded for\r\nthe production of a scene by the payment of a sum down. This appears to\r\nhave gone to one Thomas Massey, who contracted for the production. He\r\nhad already supplied properties in 1584. In 1603 he quarrelled with the\r\ncorporation about certain devices shown on the visit of the Princess\r\nElizabeth to Coventry. In 1606 he hired some acting-apparel from the\r\nWeavers’ company[801].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous Plays._\r\n\r\nThe _Annals_ record:—\r\n\r\n    1490-1. ‘This year was the play of St. Katherine in the little\r\n    Park.’\r\n\r\n    1504-5. ‘This yeare they played the play of St. Crytyan in the\r\n    little parke[802].’\r\n\r\n    In 1511, one of the pageants at the entry of Henry VIII had a\r\n    ‘goodly Stage Play’ upon it[803].\r\n\r\nThe Dyers in 1478, the Cappers in 1525, and the Drapers in 1556, 1566,\r\nand 1568 appear to have had plays at their dinners. Probably ‘the Golden\r\nFleece,’ for which the Cappers paid the inevitable Robert Crowe and two\r\nothers, was a play[804].\r\n\r\nThe ‘lusores de Coventry’ played at Maxstoke Priory between 1422 and 1461\r\n(Appendix E, ii). ‘Certain Players of Coventrye’ were at court in 1530\r\n(Appendix E, viii).\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the sixteenth century occur notices of travelling\r\n‘players of Coventrie.’ They were at Bristol and Abingdon in 1570, and\r\nat Leicester in 1569 and 1571. At Abingdon they are described as ‘Mr.\r\nSmythes players of Coventree.’ John Smythe, the writer of the Destruction\r\nof Jerusalem, was only seven years old in 1570. Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps\r\nwould read ‘_the_ Smythes’ players[805].’\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Corpus Christi Procession._\r\n\r\nThe procession or ‘Ridyng’ on Corpus Christi day is first mentioned in\r\nthe _Leet Book_ in 1444, and in 1446 is an order ‘quod le Ruydyng in\r\nfesto Corporis Christi fiat prout ex antiquo tempore consueverint.’ It\r\ntook place early in the day after a ‘breakfast.’ The craft-guilds rode in\r\nit, and provided minstrels and torchbearers. The Trinity Guild seems to\r\nhave borne a crucifix, and the Guild of Corpus Christi and St. Nicholas\r\nthe host under a canopy. The accounts of the Smiths include the following\r\nitems:—\r\n\r\n  ‘1476. Item ffor hors hyre to Herod, iijᵈ.\r\n\r\n   1489. Item payd for Aroddes garment peynttyng that he went a\r\n           prossasyon in, xxᵈ.’\r\n\r\nThe other extant guild accounts throw no light on the presence of\r\nrepresentatives of the plays in the procession; but the Corpus Christi\r\nguild itself provided dramatic personages.\r\n\r\n  ‘1501. payd for a Crown of sylver & gyld for the Mare on Corpus Christi\r\n           day, xliijˢ ixᵈ.\r\n\r\n   1539. peny bred for the appostells, vjᵈ.\r\n         beiff for the appostles, viijᵈ.\r\n         to the Marie for hir gloves and wages, ijˢ.\r\n         the Marie to offer, jᵈ.\r\n         Kateryne & Margaret, iiijᵈ.\r\n         viij virgyns, viijᵈ.\r\n         to Gabriell for beryng the lilly, iiijᵈ.\r\n         to James & Thomas of Inde, viijᵈ.\r\n         to x other apostells, xxᵈ.\r\n\r\n   1540. for makyng the lilly, iijˢ iiijᵈ.\r\n\r\n   1541. to Gabryel for beryng the light [lilly?] iiijᵈ.\r\n         xij torches of wax for the apostles.\r\n\r\n   1544. a new coat & a peir of hoes for Gabriell, iijˢ. iiij.[806]’\r\n\r\n\r\nCROXTON, NORFOLK(?).\r\n\r\nSee s.v. _Texts_ (i), _Croxton Play_, _The Sacrament_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVENTRY, NORTHAMPTONSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe ‘lusores de Daventry’ played at Maxstoke Priory between 1422 and 1461\r\n(Appendix E, ii).\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBLIN, IRELAND.\r\n\r\nThe version of the _Quem quaeritis_ used at the Church of St. John the\r\nEvangelist in the fourteenth century is printed in Appendix R.\r\n\r\nThe Chain Book of the City contains the following memorandum, apparently\r\nentered in 1498.\r\n\r\nCorpus Christi day a pagentis:—\r\n\r\n‘The pagentis of Corpus Christi day, made by an olde law and confermed\r\nby a semble befor Thomas Collier, Maire of the Citte of Divelin, and\r\nJuries, Baliffes and commones, the iiiith Friday next after midsomer, the\r\nxiii. yere of the reign of King Henri the VIIth [1498]:\r\n\r\n‘Glovers: Adam and Eve, with an angill followyng berryng a swerde.

Peyn, xl._s._’\r\n\r\nThis list is immediately followed by a second, practically identical with\r\nit, of ‘The Pagentys of Corpus Christi Processioun.’\r\n\r\nThese pageants, though the subjects are drawn from the usual Corpus\r\nChristi play-cycle (with the addition of King Arthur and the nine\r\nWorthies), appear, from their irregular order, to be only dumb-show\r\naccompaniments of a procession. In 1569 the crafts were directed to keep\r\nthe same order in the Shrove Tuesday ball riding (cf. vol. i. p. 150),\r\n‘as they are appointed to go with their pageants on Corpus Christi daye\r\nby the Chayne Boke[807].’\r\n\r\nThe same intermixture of profane and sacred elements marks the late and\r\nscanty records of actual plays in Dublin.\r\n\r\n‘Tho. Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the\r\nyear 1528, was invited to a new play every day in Christmas, Arland Usher\r\nbeing then mayor, and Francis Herbert and John Squire bayliffs, wherein\r\nthe taylors acted the part of Adam and Eve; the shoemakers represented\r\nthe story of Crispin and Crispinianus; the vintners acted Bacchus and his\r\nstory; the Carpenters that of Joseph and Mary; Vulcan, and what related\r\nto him, was acted by the Smiths; and the comedy of Ceres, the goddess of\r\ncorn, by the Bakers. Their stage was erected on Hoggin Green (now called\r\nCollege Green), and on it the priors of St. John of Jerusalem, of the\r\nblessed Trinity, and All Hallows caused two plays to be acted, the one\r\nrepresenting the passion of our Saviour, and the other the several deaths\r\nwhich the apostles suffered[808].’ In 1541 there were ‘epulae, comoediae,\r\net certamina ludicra’ when Henry VIII was proclaimed King of Ireland.\r\nThese included ‘the nine Worthies.’ On the return of Lord Sussex from an\r\nexpedition against James MacConnell in 1557, ‘the Six Worthies was played\r\nby the city[809].’\r\n\r\nA seventeenth-century transcript of a lost leaf of the Chain Book has the\r\nfollowing order for the St. George’s day procession:—\r\n\r\n‘The Pageant of St. George’s day, to be ordered and kept as hereafter\r\nfolloweth:\r\n\r\n‘The Mayor of the yeare before to finde the Emperour and Empress with\r\ntheir followers, well apparelled, that is to say, the Emperor, with two\r\nDoctors, and the Empress, with two knights, and two maydens to beare the\r\ntraynes of their gownes, well apparelled, and [the Guild of] St. George\r\nto pay their wages.\r\n\r\n‘Item: Mr. Mayor for the time being to find St. George a-horseback, and\r\nthe wardens to pay three shillings and four pence for his wages that\r\nday. And the Bailives for the time being to find four horses, with men\r\nupon them, well apparelled, to beare the pole-axe, the standard, and the\r\nEmperor and St. George’s sword.\r\n\r\n‘Item: The elder master of the yeald to find a mayd well aparelled to\r\nlead the dragon; and the Clerk of the Market to find a good line for the\r\ndragon.\r\n\r\n‘Item: The elder warden to find St. George, with four trumpettors, and\r\nSt. George’s [Guild] to pay their wages.\r\n\r\n‘Item: the yonger warden to finde the king of Dele and the queene of\r\nDele, and two knightes to lead the queene of Dele, with two maydens to\r\nbeare the trayne of her goune, all wholy in black apparell, and to have\r\nSt. George’s chappell well hanged and apparelled to every purpose with\r\ncushins ... russhes and other necessaries belonging for said St. George’s\r\nday[810].’\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNSTABLE, BEDFORDSHIRE.\r\n\r\nOne Geoffrey, a Norman, was ‘apud Dunestapliam, expectans scholam S.\r\nAlbani sibi repromissam; ubi quendam ludum de S. Katerina (quem Miracula\r\nvulgariter appellamus) fecit; ad quae decoranda petiit a Sacrista\r\nS. Albani, ut sibi capae chorales accommodarentur, et obtinuit.’\r\nUnfortunately the ‘capae’ were burnt. This must have been early in the\r\ntwelfth century, as Geoffrey in grief became a monk, and was Abbot of St.\r\nAlbans by 1119[811].\r\n\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH, SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\nThe civic records show traces of municipal plays in 1554, but it is not\r\nclear that they were miracle-plays proper or of long standing. Sir David\r\nLyndsay’s _Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis_ was played in the Greenside\r\nbetween 1550 and 1559 (cf. p. 442). On June 15, 1554, a payment was made\r\nto Sir William Makdougall, ‘maister of werk,’ for those ‘that furneist\r\nthe grayth to the convoy of the moris to the Abbay and of the play maid\r\nthat samyn day the tent day of Junii instant.’ Makdougall was to deliver\r\nto the dean of guild the handscenye [ensign] and canves specifiit in the\r\nsaid tikkit to be kepit to the behuif of the town.’ Sums were also paid\r\nthis summer for ‘the playing place’ or ‘the play field now biggand in the\r\nGrenesid.’\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 12 Walter Bynnyng was paid for ‘the making of the play graith’\r\nand for painting the ‘handsenye’ and ‘playariss facis.’ He was to ‘mak\r\nthe play geir vnderwrittin furthcumand to the town, quhen thai haif ado\r\nthairwith, quhilkis he has now ressauit; viz. viij play hattis, ane\r\nkingis crown, ane myter, ane fulis hude, ane septour, ane pair angell\r\nwingis, twa angell hair, ane chaplet of tryvmphe.’\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 28 ‘the prouest, baillies and counsale findis it necessar and\r\nexpedient that the litill farsche and play maid be William Lauder be\r\nplayit afoir the Quenis grace[812].’ I trace a note of regret for the\r\ndoubtful morals and certain expense of the entertainments which the\r\npresence in Edinburgh of the newly-made Regent, Mary of Lorraine, imposed\r\nupon the burghers.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTERFORD, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nLord Howard rewarded the players of ‘Esterforde’ on Jan. 7, 1482\r\n(Appendix E, vii).

The Constitution provides for a procession, on Corpus Christi\r\nday, unless it is hindered ‘pro qualitate temporis[825].’\r\n\r\nThe notices in the seventeenth-century Annals of the town point to a play\r\nas well as a procession[826]. The Guild included all the burgesses; each\r\npaying 16_d._ a year and attending the dinner on Corpus Christi day.\r\n\r\nIn 1443 the common marsh was devised ‘to maintaine and repaire the\r\npageants of the Guilde.’\r\n\r\nIn 1445 J. Causton was admitted burgess on condition of maintaining for\r\nseven years ‘the ornaments belonging to Corpus Χⁱ pageant and the stages,\r\nreceiving the Charges thereof from the farmers of the Common Marshe and\r\nthe Portmen’s medow, as the Bayliffs for the time being shall think\r\nmeete.’ Arrears were paid to J. Caldwell for his charge of ‘Corpus Chr.\r\npageant.’\r\n\r\nIn 1491 an order was made, laying down, ‘Howe euery occupacion of\r\ncraftsmen schuld order themselves in the goyng with their pageantes in\r\nthe procession of Corpus Christi.’ The list closes with the ‘Friers\r\nCarmelites,’ ‘Friers Minors,’ and ‘Friers Prechors.’ The subjects of the\r\npageants are unfortunately not given. The pageant cost 45_s._ 1_d._\r\n\r\nIn 1492 ‘areres of yᵉ Pageant’ were paid, and ‘kepers of the Ornaments\r\nand utensiles of Corpus Christi appointed.’\r\n\r\nIn 1493, 1494, 1495, 1496 orders were made for the provision of the\r\n‘pageant.’ In 1495 there was a grant of £3 11. 0 for it. In 1496 it was\r\n‘at the charge of such as have been used.’\r\n\r\nIn 1502 ‘Corpus Christi pageant shall hereafter be observed, and a\r\nconvenient artificer shall be intertained to that end, and shall have\r\n40_s._’ Each Portman was to pay 1_s._ 4_d._, each of the ‘twenty-four’\r\n8_d._; the other 6_s._ 8_d._ to be levied. ‘Noe Bayliff shall interrupt\r\nor hinder the pageant, unless by order of the great court or uppon\r\nspecial cause.’ Collectors for the pageant were chosen.\r\n\r\nIn 1504 the ‘collectors for the play of Corpus Christi’ were ‘to make a\r\nfree burgess for their expences at Corpus Christi play.’ These collectors\r\nare again mentioned in 1505 and 1506, and in the latter year ‘ornaments’\r\nand ‘stageing for Corpus Christi play.’\r\n\r\nIn 1509 all inhabitants are to have ‘their Tabernas and attendance at the\r\nffeast of Corpus Christi’ and ‘everyone shall hold by the order of their\r\nprocession, according to the Constitutions.’\r\n\r\nIn 1511 a contribution is ordered to a pageant of St. George, and the\r\nCorpus Christi dinner and pageant are laid aside.\r\n\r\nFrom 1513 to 1519 the play is ordered to be laid aside in every year\r\nexcept 1517. In 1520 it ‘shall hold this yere,’ and the pageant is\r\nordered to be ready. It is laid aside in 1521 until further order, and\r\nthe master of the pageant called ‘the shipp’ is to have the same ready\r\nunder forfeiture of £10. It is ‘deferred’ in 1522 and ‘laid aside for\r\never’ in 1531.\r\n\r\nProbably it was never revived. But there is an order for the procession\r\nwith the Sacrament in 1540, and in 1542 this had its ‘pageants’ to which\r\neach householder was rated at 1_d._\r\n\r\nIn 1552 the guild is held on the Sunday after Trinity Sunday, and similar\r\nmeetings continue until 1644.\r\n\r\nOn a possible performance of Bale’s _King John_ at the visit of Elizabeth\r\nto Ipswich in 1561 see _Texts_ (iii), s.v. _Bale_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIXWORTH, SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\nThetford Priory made a payment ‘in regard to Ixworth play,’ in 1507-8\r\n(Appendix E, iii).\r\n\r\n\r\nKELVEDON, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nSee s.v. EASTERFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nKENDAL, WESTMORELAND.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Boke of Record,’ a municipal register begun at the incorporation in\r\n1575, refers to the Corpus Christi play by the crafts as established at\r\nthat date. On Feb. 14, 1575, the corporation forbade feasts of more than\r\ntwelve guests;\r\n\r\n‘Such lyke ... as have bene comonlye used at ... metyings of men off\r\nOccupacyons aboute orders for their severall pagiands off Corpus xpi\r\nplaye ... exceptyd and reserved.’\r\n\r\nAn order ‘ffor the playe’ of Sept. 22, 1586, forbade the alderman to give\r\npermission for the acting of the play in any year without the consent of\r\nhis brethren[827].’\r\n\r\nThe plays lasted into the seventeenth century. Thomas Heywood says in\r\n1612, that, ‘to this day,’ Kendall holds the privilege of its fairs and\r\nother charters by yearly stage-plays[828]. And Weever, about 1631, speaks\r\nof—\r\n\r\n‘Corpus Christi play in my countrey, which I have seene acted at Preston,\r\nand Lancaster, and last of all at Kendall, in the beginning of the raigne\r\nof King James; for which the Townesmen were sore troubled; and upon good\r\nreasons the Play finally supprest, not onely there, but in all other\r\nTownes of the Kingdome[829].’\r\n\r\nIn the MS. life of the Puritan vicar of Rotherham, John Shaw, is a\r\ndescription of how he spoke to an old man at Cartmel of salvation by\r\nChrist:—\r\n\r\n‘Oh Sir,’ said he, ‘I think I heard of that man you speak of once in a\r\nplay at Kendall, called Corpus Christ’s play, where there was a man on\r\na tree, and blood ran down, &c. And afterwards he professed he could not\r\nremember that he ever heard of salvation by Jesus, but in that play[830].’\r\n\r\n\r\nKENNINGHALL, NORFOLK.\r\n\r\n‘Kenningale game’ was at Harling (q.v.) in 1463, and the ‘Kenyngale\r\nplayers’ in 1467.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILKENNY, IRELAND.\r\n\r\nJohn Bale, in his description of his brief episcopate of Ossory, gives\r\nan account of the proclamation of Queen Mary, at Kilkenny, on August\r\n20, 1553, ‘The yonge men, in the Forenone, played a Tragedye of God’s\r\nPromyses in the olde Lawe, at the Market Crosse, with Organe, Plainges,\r\nand Songes very aptely. In the Afternone agayne they played a Commedie\r\nof Sanct Johan Baptistes Preachinges, of Christes Baptisynge, and of his\r\nTemptacion in the Wildernesse, to the small contentacion of the Prestes\r\nand other Papistes there[831].’\r\n\r\nThese plays are extant; cf. _Texts_ (iii), s.v. _Bale_.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING’S LYNN, NORFOLK.\r\n\r\nThere was a Corpus Christi guild as early as 1400, and the Tailors’\r\n_Ordinances_ of 1449 require them to take part in the Corpus Christi\r\nprocession; but I do not find evidence of regular annual plays. The\r\nChamberlains’ Accounts for 1385, however, include:—\r\n\r\n‘iijˢ iiijᵈ to certain players, playing an interlude on Corpus Christi\r\nday.’\r\n\r\n‘iijˢ iiijᵈ paid by the Mayor’s gift to persons playing the interlude of\r\nSt. Thomas the Martyr.’\r\n\r\nAnd those for 1462—\r\n\r\n‘iijˢ paid for two flagons of red wine, spent in the house of Arnulph\r\nTixonye, by the Mayor and most of his brethren, being there to see a\r\ncertain play at the Feast of Corpus Christi.’ In the same year the\r\nSkinners and Sailors ‘of the town’ received rewards ‘for their labour\r\nabout the procession of Corpus Christi this year[832].’\r\n\r\nIn 1409-10 Lady de Beaufort came to see a play[833].\r\n\r\nSee also s.v.

This\r\nwas copied by Sharp, 141. But it refers to the _York Plays_, then in\r\nThoresby’s possession.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEICESTER.\r\n\r\nThe Hall book of the Corporation contains the following entries:—\r\n\r\n1477, March 26. ‘The pleyers the which pleed the passion play the yere\r\nnext afore brought yne a byll the whiche was of serten devties of mony\r\nand whedʳ the passion shulbe put to crafts to be bounden or nay.

There were great\r\nprocessions on Whit Monday from the churches of St. Martin and St. Mary\r\nto that of St. Margaret, and in these the Twelve Apostles figured[840].\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the same churches show plays apparently distinct from the\r\nPassion play.\r\n\r\n    _St. Mary’s._\r\n\r\n       1491.

An anthem sung at\r\nLauds on New Year’s day ... begins thus[847]’ (cf. _Sarum Breviary_,\r\nccxciii). Was this spectacle a Moses play forming part of, or detached\r\nfrom, an _Ordo Prophetarum_?\r\n\r\nA set of local annals (1361-1515) compiled in the sixteenth century\r\nrecords the following plays:—\r\n\r\n   1397-8. Ludus de Pater Noster lvi anno.\r\n  1410-11. Ludus Pater Noster.\r\n   1424-5. Ludus Pater Noster.\r\n   1441-2. Ludus Sancti Laurentii.\r\n   1447-8. Ludus Sanctae Susannae.\r\n   1452-3. Ludus de Kyng Robert of Cesill.\r\n   1455-6. Ludus de Sancta Clara.\r\n   1456-7. Ludus de Pater Noster.\r\n   1471-2. Ludus Corporis Christi.\r\n   1473-4. Ludus de Corporis Christi.\r\n\r\nCanon Rock, apparently quoting the same document, also mentions a ‘Ludus\r\nde Sancto Iacobo[848].’\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 13, 1521, the Corporation ‘agreed that Paternoster Play shall be\r\nplayed this year[849].’\r\n\r\nIn 1478-80 the Chapter _Curialitates_ include ‘In commun’ canonicorum\r\nexistent’ ad videndum ludum Corporis Christi in camera Iohannis Sharpe\r\ninfra clausum, 17ˢ 11ᵈ[850].’\r\n\r\nBut the Corpus Christi play, although so called, would appear not to\r\nhave been played upon Corpus Christi day, but to be identical with the\r\n_visus_ or ‘sights’ of St. Anne’s day (July 26). These are mentioned\r\nalmost yearly in the city minute-books of the early sixteenth century,\r\nand appear to have been cyclic and processional. They certainly included\r\nNoah’s Ship, the Three Kings of Cologne, the Ascension, and the\r\nCoronation of the Virgin. The Corporation ordered them to be played; the\r\nmayor and the ‘graceman,’ or chief officer of the guild of Saint Anne,\r\ndirected them; the guild priest gave his assistance in the preparations.\r\nIn 1517 Sir Robert Denyer was appointed on condition of doing this.\r\nGarments were often borrowed from the priory and the local magnates. In\r\n1521 Lady Powys lent a gown for one of the Maries, and the other had a\r\ncrimson gown of velvet belonging to the guild. Each craft was bound under\r\npenalty to provide a pageant. In 1540 some of the crafts had broken their\r\npageants and were ordered to restore them. In the same year a large door\r\nwas made at the late school-house that the pageants might be sent in, and\r\n4_d._ was charged for housing every pageant, ‘and Noy schippe 12ᵈ.’ In\r\n1547 the valuables of the procession were sold, but the ‘gear’ (i.e. the\r\ntheatrical properties) still existed in 1569. During the Marian reaction\r\nin 1554 and 1555 ‘it was ordered that St. Anne’s Gild with Corpus Christi\r\nPlay shall be brought forth and played this year[851].’\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations of the Cathedral Chapter to the civic play are\r\nnoteworthy. In 1469 the chapter paid the expenses of the _visus_ of the\r\nAssumption given on St. Anne’s day in the nave of the church. In 1483 it\r\nwas similarly agreed to have ‘Ludum, sive Serimonium, de Coronatione,\r\nsive Assumptione, beatae Mariae, prout consuetum fuerat, in navi dictae\r\nEcclesiae.’ This was to be played and shown in the procession to be\r\nmade by the citizens on St. Anne’s day. Apparently the crafts played\r\nthe earlier plays of the cycle during the progress of the St. Anne’s\r\nprocession through the streets, and the Chapter gave the Assumption as a\r\nfinale to the whole in the cathedral itself. But their interest extended\r\nbeyond their own _visus_. In 1488 Robert Clarke received an appointment,\r\nbecause ‘he is so ingenious in the show and play called the Ascension,\r\ngiven every year on St. Anne’s Day[852].’\r\n\r\nUnder Elizabeth a new play appears. In 1564 the Corporation ordered\r\n‘that a standing [i.e. non-processional?] play of some story of the\r\nBible shall be played two days this summertime.’ The subject chosen was\r\nTobias, and the place the Broadgate. Some of the properties, e.g. ‘Hell\r\nmouth, with a nether chap,’ were possibly the old ‘gear’ of St. Anne’s\r\nguild. In 1567 ‘the stage-play of the story of Toby’ was again played at\r\nWhitsuntide[853].\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE BADDOW, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nLittle Baddow men hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe during 1564-6.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON.\r\n\r\nWilliam Fitzstephen (†1170-82), in a description of London prefatory to\r\nhis _Vita_ of St. Thomas à Becket, says:—\r\n\r\n‘Lundonia pro spectaculis theatralibus, pro ludis scenicis, ludos habet\r\nsanctiores, representationes miraculorum quae sancti confessores\r\noperati sunt, seu representationes passionum quibus claruit constantia\r\nmartyrum[854].’\r\n\r\nNothing more is heard of plays in London until 1378, when the scholars of\r\nSt. Paul’s petitioned Richard II,\r\n\r\n‘to prohibit some unexpert people from representing the History of the\r\nOld Testament, to the great prejudice of the said Clergy, who have been\r\nat great expence in order to represent it publickly at Christmas[855].’\r\n\r\nThe chronicler Malvern records that in 1384,—\r\n\r\n‘Vicesimo nono die Augusti clerici Londoniae apud Skynnereswelle fecerunt\r\nquendam ludum valde sumptuosum, duravitque quinque diebus[856].’\r\n\r\nIn 1391 Malvern again records,—\r\n\r\n‘Item xviijᵒ die Iulii clerici Londonienses fecerunt ludum satis curiosum\r\napud Skynnereswell per dies quatuor duraturum, in quo tam vetus quam\r\nnovum testamentum oculariter ludendo monstrabant[857].’\r\n\r\nIn 1393, according to the _London Chronicle_, ‘was the pley of seynt\r\nKaterine[858].’\r\n\r\nOther chronicles record a play in 1409:—\r\n\r\n‘This yere was the play at Skynners Welle, whiche endured Wednesday,\r\nThorsday, Friday, and on Soneday it was ended[859].’\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the royal wardrobe show that a scaffold of timber was\r\nbuilt for the King (Henry IV), prince, barons, knights, and ladies on\r\nthis occasion, and that the play showed,—\r\n\r\n‘how God created Heaven and Earth out of nothing, and how he created Adam\r\nand so on to the Day of Judgment[860].’\r\n\r\nFinally, the Grey Friars Chronicle mentions a yet longer play in 1411:—\r\n\r\n‘This year beganne a gret pley from the begynnyng of the worlde at the\r\nskynners’ welle, that lastyd vij dayes contynually; and there ware the\r\nmoste parte of the lordes and gentylles of Ynglond[861].’\r\n\r\nThe performers in most, if not all, of this group of plays were the\r\nclerks in minor orders who naturally abounded in London. The Guild of St.\r\nNicholas of Parish Clerks had existed since 1233. In 1442 they received\r\na charter, which refers to ‘diversis charitatis et pietatis operibus\r\nper ipsos annuatim exhibitis et inventis[862].’ These _opera_ possibly\r\ninclude the plays, which may have become annual between 1411 and 1442.\r\nThey seem to have been given at various times of year, and hard by the\r\nwell, variously described as Skinners Well or Clerkenwell. The Priory of\r\nSt. Bartholomew is not far, and the plays may have had some connexion,\r\nat one time or another, with the famous Bartholomew Fair[863]. It was\r\nprobably the double name of the well that led Stowe to say that ‘the\r\nskinners of London held there certain plays yearly, played of Holy\r\nScripture[864].’\r\n\r\nThere is another gap of a century in the history of these greater London\r\nplays. But on July 20, 1498, Henry VII rewarded ‘the pleyers of London’\r\n(Appendix E, viii), and of 1508 the annalist of Henry VII, Bernard\r\nAndrew, says:—\r\n\r\n‘Spectacula vero natalis divi Iohannis vespere longe praeclarissima hoc\r\nanno ostensa fuerunt, quemadmodum superioris mensis huiusque aliquot\r\nfestis diebus pone Christi ecclesiam circa urbis pomaria divinae\r\nrecitatae fuere historiae[865].’\r\n\r\nSome of the London churches had their own plays, as may be seen from\r\ntheir churchwardens’ accounts. Those of St. Margaret’s, Southwark, have\r\nthe following entries:—\r\n\r\n  ‘1444-5.

They were employed also at the\r\nfeasts of the city guilds. The Brewers, for instance, had plays in 1425\r\nand 1433, and in 1435 paid ‘4 clerkis of London, for a play[868].’ The\r\nCarpenters paid iiijˢ iiijᵈ for a play in 1490[869]. London players\r\noccasionally performed before Henry VII. Besides ‘the players of London’\r\nin 1498, he rewarded in 1501 the players at ‘Myles ende[870].’\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to revive religious plays during the Marian reaction.\r\nOn June 7, 1557, ‘be-gane a stage play at the Grey freers of the Passyon\r\nof Cryst[871].’ On St. Olave’s day, July 29, in the same year ‘was the\r\nchurch holiday in Silver street; and at eight of the clock at night began\r\na stage play of a goodly matter, that continued until xij at mydnyght,\r\nand then they mad an end with a good song[872].’\r\n\r\nThe last such play in London was ‘the acting of Christ’s Passion at Elie\r\nhouse in Holborne when Gundemore [Gondomar] lay there, on Good-Friday at\r\nnight, at which there were thousands present[873].’ This would be between\r\n1613 and 1622.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Midsummer Watch._\r\n\r\nA ‘marching watch’ was kept on the eves of Midsummer and SS. Peter and\r\nPaul (June 29) until 1538, and revived, for one year only, in 1548. Some\r\n2,000 men went in armour; lamps and bonfires were lit in the streets,\r\nand ‘every man’s door shadowed with green birch, long fennel, St. John’s\r\nwort; orpine, white lilies and such like, garnished upon with garlands\r\nof beautiful flowers.’ It seems to have been customary for the guilds\r\nto which the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs for the year belonged to furnish\r\npageants. Stowe says that ‘where the mayor had besides his giant three\r\npageants, each of the sheriffs had besides their giants but two pageants,\r\neach their morris dance.’ In 1505 the Grocers had ‘a pageant for the\r\nmaire [Sir John Wyngar] at Midsomer.’ In 1510 Henry VIII, disguised as\r\na groom, came to see the Midsummer Watch, and on St. Peter’s eve came\r\nopenly with the queen. There were ‘diverse goodlie shewes, as had beene\r\naccustomed.’ In 1522 the Drapers resolved ‘that there shall be no Mydsomʳ\r\npageant becaus there was so many pageants redy standyng for the Emperors\r\ncoming into London,’ and ‘for divers considerations’ to ‘surcease the\r\nsaid pageants and find xxx men in harness instead.’ But later they\r\ndecided to ‘renew all the old pageants for the house; including our newe\r\npageant of the Goldyn Flees for the mayr against mydsomʳ; also the gyant,\r\nlord Moryspyks, and a morys daunce, as was used the last year.’ The\r\naccount-books mention Lord Moryspyks or ‘Marlingspikes,’ and a ‘king of\r\nthe Moors,’ with a ‘stage’ and ‘wyld fire.’ In 1523, the King of Denmark\r\nbeing in London, the Drapers allowed the Sheriff two pageants, ‘but to\r\nbe no precedent hereafter.’ They paid ‘for garnyshyng and newe repayring\r\nof th’ Assumpcion, and also for making a new pageant of St. Ursula.’ The\r\nKing of Denmark was duly brought to see the watch. In 1524 they again had\r\na pageant, the nature of which is not specified[874].\r\n\r\n\r\nLOPHAM, NORFOLK.\r\n\r\n‘Lopham game’ was at Harling (q.v.) in 1457.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUTH, LINCOLNSHIRE.\r\n\r\nAn inventory of documents in the rood-loft in 1516 includes the ‘hole\r\nRegenall of corpus xr̄i play.’ In 1558 the corporation paid for a play\r\n‘in the markit-stede on corpus xr̄i day.’[875]\r\n\r\n\r\nLYDD, KENT.\r\n\r\nThe town accounts show a play of St. George on July 4, 1456, and payment\r\nto the ‘bane cryars’ of ‘our play’ in 1468. In 1422 the Lydd players\r\nacted at New Romney, and in 1490 the chaplain of the guild of St. George\r\nat New Romney went to see a play at Lydd, with a view to reproducing\r\nit. Between 1429 and 1490 the New Romney players acted often at Lydd,\r\nand also players of Ruckinge (1431), Wytesham (1441), Ham (1454), Hythe\r\n(1467), Folkestone (1479), Rye (1480), Stone (1490). Unnamed players were\r\nin the high street in 1485[876].\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNEHAM, OXFORDSHIRE.\r\n\r\nSee s.v. SHIPTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALDEN, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nThe Chelmsford (q.v.) play was shown at Malden in 1562.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANNINGTREE, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nJohn Manningham, of the Middle Temple, wrote in his Diary, on Feb. 8,\r\n1602, ‘The towne of Manitree in Essex holds by stage plays[877].’ So\r\nHeywood, in his _Apology for Actors_ (1612), ‘To this day there be townes\r\nthat hold the priviledge of their fairs and other charters by yearly\r\nstage-plays, as at Manningtree in Suffolke, Kendall in the North, and\r\nothers[878].’ There are further allusions to these plays in T. Nash, _The\r\nChoosing of Valentines_,\r\n\r\n          ‘a play of strange moralitie,\r\n  Showen by bachelrie of Manning-tree,\r\n  Whereto the countrie franklins flock-meale swarme[879]’;\r\n\r\nand in Dekker, _Seven Deadly Sins of London_ (1607), ‘Cruelty\r\nhas got another part to play; it is acted like the old morals at\r\nManning-tree[880].’\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXSTOKE, WARWICKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of Maxstoke Priory (a house of Augustinian canons) for 1430\r\ninclude, ‘pro ientaculis puerorum eleemosynae exeuntium ad aulam in\r\ncastro ut ibi ludum peragerent in die Purificationis, xivᵈ. Unde nihil a\r\ndomini [Clinton] thesaurario, quia saepius hoc anno ministralli castri\r\nfecerunt ministralsiam in aula conventus et Prioris ad festa plurima sine\r\nullo regardo[881].’\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLETON, NORFOLK.\r\n\r\nIn 1444 the corporation of Lynn (q.v.) showed a play with Mary and\r\nGabriel before Lord Scales[882].\r\n\r\n\r\nMILDENHALL, SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\nThetford Priory made a payment to ‘the play of Mydenale’ in 1503-4\r\n(Appendix E, iii).\r\n\r\n\r\nMILE END, MIDDLESEX.\r\n\r\nHenry VII rewarded ‘the Pleyers at Myles End’ on Aug. 6, 1501 (Appendix\r\nE, viii).\r\n\r\n\r\nMILTON, OXFORDSHIRE.\r\n\r\nSee s.v. SHIPTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOREBATH, DEVONSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe churchwardens’ accounts record an Easter play at some date between\r\n1520 and 1574[883].\r\n\r\n\r\nNAYLAND, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nRichard More, of Nayland, hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe in 1566.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, NORTHUMBERLAND.\r\n\r\nThe craft-plays on Corpus Christi day are mentioned in several\r\nfifteenth-century ordinaries, the earliest being that of the Coopers in\r\n1426/7. The last years in which performances can be proved to have been\r\ngiven are 1561 and 1562. Ordinaries dated from 1578 to 1589 stipulate\r\nfor a performance by the crafts ‘whensoever the generall plaies of the\r\ntown of Newcastle, antiently called the Corpus Christi plays, shall\r\nbe plaied,’ or the like. The determination of this point rested with\r\nthe Corporation. The Goldsmiths drew up an ‘invoic of all the players\r\napperell pertainyng to’ them in 1598/9. The cost of the plays fell on the\r\ncrafts, who took fixed contributions from their members. The Taylors in\r\n1536 required iijᵈ from each hireling, and vijᵈ from each newly admitted\r\nmember. The Fullers and Dyers paid 9_s._ in 1561 for ‘the play lettine’\r\nto four persons.\r\n\r\nThe mentions of ‘bearers of the care and baneres’ of them ‘that wated\r\nof the paient’ and of ‘the carynge of the trowt and wyn about the town’\r\nseem to show that the plays were processional. On the other hand the one\r\nextant play (cf. p. 424) ends with a remark of the _Diabolus_ to ‘All\r\nthat is gathered in this stead.’ Perhaps the pageants first took part in\r\nthe Corpus Christi procession proper and afterwards gathered in a field.\r\nThe Mercers’ ordinary of 1480 shows that the procession was ‘by vij in\r\nmorning,’ and the plays were certainly in the evening, for it was deposed\r\nin a law-suit at Durham in 1569 that Sir Robert Brandling of Newcastle\r\nsaid on Corpus Christi day, 1562, that ‘he would after his dinner draw\r\nhis will, and after the plays would send for his consell, and make it up’\r\n(_Norfolk Archaeology_, iii. 18).\r\n\r\nFor the list of plays, so far as it can be recovered, see p. 424. The\r\nordinary of the Goldsmiths (1536) requires their play (Kynges of Coleyn)\r\nto be given at their feast[884].\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ROMNEY, KENT.\r\n\r\nThere are many notices of a play in the town accounts between 1428\r\nand 1560. In 1456 the wardens of the play of the _Resurrection_ are\r\nmentioned. In 1463 the jurats paid Agnes Ford 6_s._ 8_d._ ‘for the play\r\nof the Interlude of our _Lord’s Passion_.’ From 1474 the banns of the\r\nplay are mentioned. In 1477 the play was on Whit-Tuesday. In 1518 the\r\nLord Warden of the Cinque Ports forbade the play, but it was revived\r\nelaborately in 1560. The accounts mention the purchase of copes and\r\nvestures from the corporation of Lydd, and refer to ‘a fool,’ ‘the Cytye\r\nof Samarye,’ ‘our last play,’ ‘the iijᵗʰ play,’ ‘the iiijᵗʰ play,’ and\r\nthe ‘bane cryers.’ No crafts are mentioned: perhaps the play was produced\r\nby the corporation itself. The performances may have been on Crockhill\r\nor Crockley Green. ‘Playstool’ is a common name for a bit of land in\r\nKent. Performances were often given in other towns: see s.v. LYDD. The\r\nplay seems to have been only a _Passion and Resurrection_ play, and not\r\na complete cycle. ‘Le Playboke’ is mentioned from 1516. It is in an\r\nElizabethan inventory of town records. A second play of _St. George_\r\nwas probably started in 1490 when a chaplain of the guild of St. George\r\nwent to see the Lydd _St. George_ play, with a view to reproducing it.\r\nIn 1497 the chaplains received the profits of the play. Players from\r\nthe following towns are found acting at New Romney: Hythe (1399), Lydd\r\n(1422), Wittersham (1426, they ‘shewed th’ interlude’), Herne (1429),\r\nRuckinge (1430), Folkestone (1474), Appledore (1488), Chart (1489),\r\nRye (1489), Wye (1491), Brookland (1494), Halden (1499), Bethersden\r\n(1508)[885].\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHAMPTON, NORTHAMPTONSHIRE.\r\n\r\nBrotanek (_Anglia_, xxi. 21) conjectures that the _Abraham and Isaac_ of\r\nthe Dublin MS. may come from Northampton (cf. p. 427), and hints at an\r\nexplanation of the ‘N. towne’ in the prologue to the _Ludus Coventriae_\r\nas ‘N[orthampton] towne’ (cf. p. 421).\r\n\r\nBut the only allusion even remotely suggesting miracle-plays that I\r\ncan find in the printed civic records is in 1581, in which year some\r\ninterrogatories as to St. George’s Hall contain a deposition by an old\r\nman to the effect that he had known the hall fifty years, and that the\r\nmayor and chamberlains had been wont to lay therein pageants, &c.[886]\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWICH, NORFOLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whitsun Plays._\r\n\r\nJ. Whetley writes from Norwich on Corpus Christi even (May 20), 1478,\r\nto Sir John Paston in London, of a visit of Lord Suffolk to Hellesden,\r\n‘at hys beyng ther that daye ther was never no man that playd Herrod\r\nin Corpus Crysty play better and more agreable to hys pageaunt than he\r\ndud[887].’\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it is fair to infer from this that in 1478 the\r\nNorwich plays were not at Whitsuntide, but at Corpus Christi; but this\r\nwould account for J. Whetley’s trope.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 21, 1527, the guild of St. Luke, composed of painters, braziers,\r\nplumbers, &c., made a presentment to the Assembly of the town that,—\r\n\r\n‘where of longtime paste the said Guylde of Seynt Luke yerly till nowe\r\nhath ben used to be kept and holden within the citie aforesaid upon the\r\nMundaye in pentecoste weke at which daye and the daye next ensuyng many\r\nand divers disgisyngs and pageaunts, as well of the lieffs and martyrdoms\r\nof divers and many hooly Saynts, as also many other light and feyned\r\nfigurs and picturs of other persones and bests; the sight of which\r\ndisgisings and pageaunts, as well yerly on the said Mondaye in pentecoste\r\nweke in the time of procession then goyng about a grett circuitte of the\r\nforsaid citie, as yerly the Tuysday in the same weke [serving] the lord\r\nnamed the Lord of Misrule at Tumlond within the same citie, hath ben and\r\nyet is sore coveted, specially by the people of the countre.’\r\n\r\nThe presentment goes on to show that much resort and profit have accrued\r\nto the city, but all the cost has fallen on the guild, which ‘is almost\r\nfully decayed’; and urges an order,—\r\n\r\n‘that every occupacion wythyn the seyd Citye maye yerly at the said\r\nprocession upon the Mondaye in Pentecost weke sette forth one pageaunt.’\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that each craft should play,—\r\n\r\n‘one such pageaunt as shalbe assigned and appoynted by Master Mair and\r\nhis brethern aldermen, as more playnly appereth in a boke thereof made.’\r\n\r\nIn the same hand is a list of crafts and plays (cf. p. 425)[888].\r\n\r\nSome extracts made in the eighteenth century from the, now lost, books of\r\nthe Grocers’ Company, contain (_a_) two versions of their play on _The\r\nFall_, dating from 1533 and 1565 respectively (cf. p. 425), and (_b_)\r\nvarious notices of the same from the Assembly Book.\r\n\r\nThe latter begin in 1534, when ‘4 Surveyors of yᵉ Pageant’ with a\r\n‘Bedell’ were chosen, and an assessment of 22_s._ 10_d._ made for the\r\npageant and the Corpus Christi procession. The expenses include, besides\r\nrepairs to the pageant, fees to actors, refreshments, &c.,—\r\n\r\n‘It. to Sʳ Stephen Prowet for makyng of a newe ballet, 12ᵈ.\r\n\r\nHouse ferme for ye Pageant, 2ˢ.’\r\n\r\nThe pageant went in 1535 and 1536. In 1537 it ‘went not at Wytsontyde,’\r\nbut went in October ‘in yᵉ Processyon for yᵉ Byrthe of Prynce Edward.’\r\nFrom 1538 to 1546 it went, the assessment for pageant and procession\r\nbeing about 20_s._ to 30_s._ As to 1547 the record is not clear. Then\r\nthere is a gap in the extracts, and from 1556 onwards the ‘Gryffon,’\r\n‘Angell,’ and ‘Pendon’ of the Corpus Christi procession, with flowers,\r\ngrocery, and fruit ‘to garnish yᵉ tre wᵗʰ,’ &c., appear alone in the\r\naccounts. In 1559 was ‘no solemnite’ at all. In 1563 it was agreed that\r\nthe pageant should be ‘preparyd ageynst yᵉ daye of Mʳ Davy his takyng\r\nof his charge of yᵉ Mayralltye,’ with a ‘devyce’ to be prepared by the\r\nsurveyors at a cost of 6_s._ 8_d._ The play cannot have quite lapsed,\r\nfor in 1565 a new version was written (cf. p. 425). It was apparently\r\ncontemplated that it might be played either alone or in a cycle. To the\r\nsame year belongs the following\r\n\r\n‘_Inventory of yᵉ p’ticulars appartaynyng to yᵉ Company of yᵉ Grocers,\r\na.d. 1565._\r\n\r\nA Pageant, yᵗ is to saye, a Howse of Waynskott paynted and buylded on a\r\nCarte wᵗ fowre whelys.\r\n\r\nA square topp to sett over yᵉ sayde Howse.\r\n\r\nA Gryffon, gylte, wᵗ a fane to sette on yᵉ sayde toppe.\r\n\r\nA bygger Iron fane to sett on yᵉ ende of yᵉ Pageante.\r\n\r\niiijˣˣ iij small Fanes belongyng to yᵉ same Pageante.\r\n\r\nA Rybbe colleryd Red.\r\n\r\nA cote & hosen wᵗ a bagg & capp for doloʳ, steyned.\r\n\r\n2 cotes & a payre hosen for Eve, stayned.\r\n\r\nA cote & hosen for Adam, Steyned.\r\n\r\nA cote wᵗ hosen & tayle for yᵉ serpente, steyned, wᵗ a wᵗ heare.\r\n\r\nA cote of yellow buckram wᵗ yᵉ Grocers’ arms for yᵉ Pendon bearer.\r\n\r\nAn Angell’s Cote & over hoses of Apis Skynns.\r\n\r\n3 paynted clothes to hang abowte yᵉ Pageant.\r\n\r\nA face & heare for yᵉ Father.\r\n\r\n2 hearys for Adam & Eve.\r\n\r\n4 head stallis of brode Inkle wᵗʰ knopps & tassells.\r\n\r\n6 Horsse Clothes, stayned, wᵗ knopps & tassells.\r\n\r\nItem, Weights, &c.’\r\n\r\nThere is a final memorandum that in 1570 the pageant was broken to pieces\r\nfor six years ‘howse ferm’ due. There had been no ‘semblye nor metynge’\r\nof the Company for eight years. The pageant had stood for six years in a\r\n‘Gate howse,’ and then ‘at yᵉ Black Fryers brydge in open strete,’ where\r\nit became ‘so weather beaten, yᵗ yᵉ cheife parte was rotton[889].’\r\n\r\n\r\n_Processions._\r\n\r\nThere were three notable annual processions at Norwich.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _Corpus Christi_ Procession, in which the crafts were held to\r\ntake part in 1489, and which appears, as above stated, in the Grocers’\r\nrecords until 1558. They seem to have been represented by the ‘griffon’\r\nfrom the top of their pageant, a banner with their arms, a crowned angel,\r\nand an emblematic ‘tree’ of fruit and grocery (possibly the ‘tree of\r\nknowledge’)[890].\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Procession of the Guild of _St. Thomas à Becket_ on the day of\r\nhis Translation (July 7) to his chapel in the wood. Here interludes were\r\nplayed[891].\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Riding of the Guild of _St. George_ on his day (April 23).\r\nThis dates from at least 1408, and a good many details as to it are\r\npreserved[892].\r\n\r\n\r\nNUNEATON, WARWICKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe ‘lusores de Eaton’ played at Maxstoke Priory between 1422 and 1461\r\n(Appendix E, ii).\r\n\r\n\r\nOXFORD, OXFORDSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the Bursars’ _computi_ of Magdalen College\r\npoint to a _Quem quaeritis_ of the longer type, with the ‘Noli me\r\ntangere’ episode.\r\n\r\n1486-7. ‘pro factura sepulturae erga pascham. xijᵈ.’\r\n\r\n1506-7. ‘pro scriptura lusi’ of St. Mary Magdalen. xᵈ.’\r\n\r\n[There were further payments in connexion with this play, and for music.]\r\n\r\n1509-10. ‘pro pane, cibo et aliis datis pueris ludentibus in die Paschae\r\n... xvijᵈ ob.’\r\n\r\n1514-5. ‘pro carnibus consumptis in capella tribus noctibus ante Pascha\r\net in tempore Nativitatis. ijˢ.’\r\n\r\n1518-9. ‘pro tinctura et factura tunicae eius qui ageret partem Christi\r\net pro crinibus mulieribus. ijˢ vjᵈ.’\r\n\r\n1536-7. ‘pro carbonibus consumptis in sacrario per custodes sepulchri, et\r\nper pueros in festis hiemalibus.’\r\n\r\n[Repeated in other years.]\r\n\r\nA chapel inventory of 1495 includes ‘unum frontale ... et unum dorsale\r\ncum quibus solet sepulcrum ornari.’\r\n\r\nThe same accounts (cf. p. 248) show items for plays in the hall at\r\nvarious seasons, and for the Boy Bishop at Christmas[893].\r\n\r\nThe churchwardens of St. Peter’s in the East kept between 1444 and 1600 a\r\nstock of players’ garments, and let them out on hire[894].\r\n\r\n\r\nPENRHYN, CORNWALL.\r\n\r\nSee _Texts_ (i), _Cornish Plays_, _Origo Mundi_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERRANZABULO, CORNWALL.\r\n\r\nThe earliest historical notice of plays in Cornwall is by Richard Carew\r\nin 1602:—\r\n\r\n‘The Guary miracle, in English, a miracle-play, is a kinde of Enterlude,\r\ncompiled in _Cornish_ out of some Scripture history, with that grossenes\r\nwhich accompanied the Romanes _vetus Comoedia_. For representing it they\r\nraise an earthen Amphitheatre in some open field, hauing the Diameter of\r\nhis enclosed playne some 40 or 50 foot. The Country people flock from\r\nall sides, many miles off, to hear and see it: for they haue therein,\r\ndeuils and deuices, to delight as well the eye as the eare; the players\r\nconne not their parts without booke, but are prompted by one called the\r\nOrdinary, who followeth at their back with the book in his hand, and\r\ntelleth them softly what they must pronounce aloud.’\r\n\r\nWhereupon Carew has a story of a ‘pleasant conceyted gentleman’ who\r\nraised laughter by repeating aloud all the Ordinary’s asides to himself.\r\n\r\nOne Mr. Scawen (†1660) describes the Guirremears as—\r\n\r\n‘solemnized not without shew of devotion in open and spacious downs, of\r\ngreat capacity, encompassed about with earthen banks, and in some part\r\nstonework of largeness to contain thousands, the shapes of which remain\r\nin many places to this day, though the use of them long since gone.’\r\n\r\nBp. Nicholson, writing in 1700, says that the plays were:—\r\n\r\n‘called Guirimir, which Mʳ Llhuyd supposes a corruption of Guarimirkle,\r\nand in the Cornish dialect to signify a miraculous play or interlude.\r\nThey were composed for begetting in the common people a right notion\r\nof the Scriptures, and were acted in the memory of some not long since\r\ndeceased.’\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth-century antiquary, Borlase, identifies the places in\r\nwhich the miracle-plays were given with those known as ‘rounds’ or,\r\nin Cornish, _plân an guare_. Of these he describes and figures two.\r\nThat of St. Just was of stone, 126 feet in diameter, with seven rows of\r\nseats inside. It was much decayed when Norris wrote in 1859. That of\r\nPerranzabulo, or Piran-sand, was of earth, 130 feet in diameter, with a\r\ncurious pit in the centre, joined to the outer ring by a narrow trench.\r\nBorlase thought that this was used for a Hell[895]. It was more likely\r\nfilled with water for Noah’s ship to float upon.\r\n\r\nThe _Ordinalia_ printed by Mr. Norris take the Cornish plays back to\r\nat least the fourteenth, if not the thirteenth century. The circular\r\ndiagrams in the manuscript exactly fall in with the round _plân an guare_\r\ndescribed by Borlase and others. They show a ring of eight _loci_ or\r\n_sedes_ (cf. p. 83), for which the terms used in the stage-directions\r\nare _pulpita_ or _tenti_, with an open circular space in the middle,\r\nwhich the stage-directions call the _platea_. The action is partly at\r\nthe _pulpita_, partly in the _platea_. A new character often marks his\r\nappearance by strutting about his _pulpitum_, or perhaps around the\r\nring—_Hic pompabit Abraham_, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the English stage-directions to the later (before 1611) _Creation of\r\nthe World_, the _platea_ becomes the _playne_, and for _pulpitum_ the\r\nterm _room_ is used. The manager of the play is the ‘conveyour.’ Some\r\nof the directions are curious and minute. At the opening, ‘The father\r\nmust be in a clowde, and when he speakethe of heaven let yᵉ levys open.’\r\nWithin is a ‘trone,’ which Lucifer tries to ascend. After the fight,\r\n‘Lucifer voydeth & goeth downe to hell apareled fowle wᵗʰ fyre about hem\r\nturning to hell and every degre of devylls of lether & spirytis on cordis\r\nruning into yᵉ playne and so remayne ther.’ Meanwhile are got ready ‘Adam\r\nand Eva aparlet in whytt lether in a place apoynted by the conveyour &\r\nnot to be sene tyll they be called & thei knell & ryse.’ Paradise has ‘ii\r\nfayre trees in yt’ and a ‘fowntaine’ and ‘fyne flowers,’ which appear\r\nsuddenly. Similarly, a little later, ‘Let fyshe of dyuers sortis apeare\r\n& serten beastis as oxen kyne shepe & such like.’ Lucifer incarnates as\r\n‘a fyne serpent made wᵗʰ a virgyn face & yolowe heare vpon her head.’\r\nPresently comes the warning, ‘ffig leaves redy to cover ther members,’\r\nand at the expulsion, ‘The garmentis of skynnes to be geven to adam and\r\neva by the angell. Receave the garmentis. Let them depart out of paradice\r\nand adam and eva following them. Let them put on the garmentis and shewe\r\na spyndell and a dystaff’ The Cain and Abel scene requires ‘a chawbone’\r\n(‘Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder’). Seth is led to Paradise\r\nand ‘Ther he vyseth all thingis, and seeth ij trees and in the one tree\r\nsytteth mary the virgyn & in her lappe her son jesus in the tope of the\r\ntree of lyf, and in the other tree yᵉ serpent wᶜʰ caused Eva to eat the\r\nappell.’ When Adam dies, his soul is taken ‘to lymbo,’ and he is buried\r\n‘in a fayre tombe wᵗʰ som churche songis at hys buryall.’ The Noah scene\r\nrequires ‘tooles and tymber redy, wᵗʰ planckis to make the arcke, a beam\r\na mallet a calkyn yre[n] ropes mass[t]es pyche and tarr.’ Presently ‘let\r\nrayne appeare’ and ‘a raven & a culver ready.’ When the flood ends, ‘An\r\nalter redy veary fayre,’ at which ‘som good church songes’ are sung, and\r\n‘a Rayne bowe to appeare.’ Like the earlier plays, this ends with a call\r\non the minstrels to pipe for a dance.\r\n\r\nA study of the place names in the _Ordinalia_ led Mr. Pedler to suggest\r\nthat they probably belonged to the neighbourhood of Penrhyn, and may have\r\nbeen composed at the collegiate house of Glasney. The St. Meriasek play\r\nis assigned by Mr. Stokes to Camborne, of which that saint was patron. It\r\nends with an invocation of St. Meriasek, St. Mary of Camborne, and the\r\nApostles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESTON, LANCASHIRE.\r\n\r\nA Corpus Christi play was acted within the lifetime of Weever, who was\r\nborn 1576 and wrote 1631[896].\r\n\r\nI find no trace of plays at the meetings of the Guild Merchant, although\r\nthere was always a great procession, which from 1762 or earlier included\r\nsuch allegorical figures as Adam and Eve for the Tailors, Vulcan for the\r\nSmiths, &c.[897]\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING, BERKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe churchwardens’ accounts of St. Lawrence’s record ‘a gaderyng of a\r\nstage-play’ in 1498.\r\n\r\nIn 1507 a play of _Adam and Eve_ was held on ‘the Sonday afore\r\nBartylmastyde’ ‘in the Forbury.’ There was a ‘schapfold,’ but ‘pagentts’\r\nwere also used. A Corpus Christi procession is also mentioned in 1509,\r\n1512, and 1539.\r\n\r\nIn 1512 also was the ‘play of Kayme,’ and in 1515, ‘Cayme’s pageaunt’ in\r\nthe market-place.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1499, and again in 1539, was the _Kings of Cologne_. This was\r\ndistinct, no doubt, from the ‘king play,’ with its ‘tree,’ ‘king game,’\r\nor ‘kyng ale,’ which took place at Whitsuntide (cf. vol. i. p. 173). But\r\nthe date, May 1 (for which cf. Abingdon), is curious for a miracle-play,\r\nand must have been influenced by the folk feast.\r\n\r\nA payment for ‘rosyn to the resurrecyon pley’ (possibly for making a\r\nblaze: cf. p. 23, note 5) occurs in 1507, and in 1533-5 payments to ‘Mʳ\r\nLaborne’ ‘for reforming the Resurrecon pley,’ and ‘for a boke’ of it.\r\n\r\nIn 1508 was a ‘pageaunt of the Passion on Easter Monday[898].’\r\n\r\n\r\nRUCKINGE, KENT.\r\n\r\nRuckinge players were at New Romney in 1430, and Lydd in 1431.\r\n\r\n\r\nRYE, SUSSEX.\r\n\r\nRye players were at Lydd in 1480, and at New Romney in 1489.\r\n\r\n\r\nSABSFORD (?), ESSEX.\r\n\r\n‘Sabsforde men’ hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe in 1562, 1563, and\r\n1566.

Actiones vero, si quae competant,\r\nin villa de Mideltone et de Langele, cedant canonico de Schiptone.\r\nEmolumentum vero actionum, si quae competant, in villa de Linham\r\naequaliter inter se dividant[901].’\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Sarum Charters_ can only explain _actiones_ as\r\n‘plays.’ Ducange gives the word in the sense of _spectacula_.\r\n\r\nAll the places named, Fyfield, Idbury, Milton, Langley, and Lyneham, are\r\nin Wychwood, and may have formed in the thirteenth century, if they do\r\nnot all now, part of the parish of Shipton-under-Wychwood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHREWSBURY, SHROPSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe civic orders and accounts refer occasionally to plays. The first\r\non record was given before Prince Arthur in 1495. In 1516 the abbot\r\nof Shrewsbury, in 1533 the bishop of Exeter, and in 1542 the royal\r\ncommissioners were present. The subject in 1516 was the martyrdoms of\r\nSaints Feliciana and Sabina. In 1518 it was the Three Kings of Cologne.\r\nIn 1510, 1518, 1533, 1553, and 1556 the performances were at Whitsuntide.\r\nThe bailiffs, according to a notice in 1556, ‘set forward’ the plays, and\r\nthe ‘lusores’ belonging to the town, who are mentioned in 1527 and 1549,\r\nwere perhaps the performers. The locality was, in 1542, the churchyard of\r\nSt. Chad’s. In 1495, 1516, and 1533 it was the quarry outside the walls,\r\nwhere it is stated in 1570 that ‘the plases have bin accustomyd to be\r\nusyd[902].’ Here there were traces of a seated amphitheatre as late as\r\n1779[903]. Thomas Ashton became master of the free school in 1561, and he\r\nproduced plays in the quarry. Elizabeth was to have been at his _Julian\r\nthe Apostate_ in 1565, but came too late. In 1567 he gave the _Passion of\r\nChrist_[904]. An undated list of Costs for the Play includes ‘a desert’s\r\n(_disard’s_) hed and berd,’ ‘vi dossen belles’ for a morris, ‘gonne\r\npoudoʳ’ and other attractions for a devil[905].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shrewsbury Show._\r\n\r\nThe craft-guilds took part in the Corpus Christi procession, and the\r\nguild of Mercers inflicted a penalty of 12_d._ on brethren who on that\r\nfeast should ‘happen to ride or goe to Coventre Faire or elleswhere\r\nout of the town of Shrewesburye to by or sell[906].’ Until about 1880\r\nShrewsbury Show was held on the Monday after Corpus Christi day.\r\nThe crafts had tableaux which, after the Reformation at least, were\r\nemblematic rather than religious[907]; thus—\r\n\r\n  Tailors.

He also asserts that there was a regular Corpus Christi play\r\nby the crafts. This seems improbable in a place of the size of Sleaford,\r\nand in fact Oliver’s elaborate description is entirely based upon data\r\nfrom elsewhere, especially the _Gubernacio Ludi_ of Beverley (cf. p.\r\n340)[910].\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAPLEFORD, ESSEX.\r\n\r\n‘Men of Starford’ hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe during 1564-6.\r\nI find no Starford, but a Stapleford Tawney and a Stapleford Abbots in\r\nEssex.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOKE BY NAYLAND, ESSEX.\r\n\r\nSir John Howard ‘ȝafe to the pleyeres of Stoke, ijˢ’ on Jan. 12, 1466.\r\n\r\nLord Howard ‘paid to the pleirs of Turton Strete xxᵈ’ on Aug. 29, 1481.\r\nThorington is still the name given to part of Stoke.

Mr. John\r\nPayne Collier says, ‘A chronicle in the Cottonian collection gives a\r\ndescription of a performance before him and Henry V, on the incidents of\r\nthe life of St. George. The representation seems to have been divided\r\ninto three parts, and to have been accomplished by certain artificial\r\ncontrivances, exhibiting, first, “the armyng of Seint George, and an\r\nAngel doyng on his spores [spurs]”; secondly, “Seint George riding and\r\nfightyng with the dragon, with his spere in his hand”; and, thirdly, “a\r\ncastel, and Seint George and the Kynges daughter ledyng the lambe in at\r\nthe castel gates.” Here we have clearly the outline of the history of St.\r\nGeorge of Cappadocia, which often formed the subject of a miracle-play;\r\nbut whether, in this instance, it was accompanied with dialogue, or was\r\n(as is most probable) merely a splendid dumb show, assisted by temporary\r\nerections of castles, &c., we are not informed.’ This performance is\r\naccepted from Collier, i. 29, by Ward, i. 50, Pollard, xx, and other\r\ndistinguished writers. They ought to have known him better. The authority\r\nhe quotes, _Cotton. MS. Calig. B. II_, is wrong. But in _Cotton. MS.\r\nJulius B. I_, one of the MSS. of the _London Chronicle_, is the following\r\npassage, ‘And the first sotelte was our lady armyng seint George, and an\r\nangel doyng on his spores; the ijᵈᵉ sotelte was seint George ridyng and\r\nfightyng with the dragon, with his spere in his hand; the iijᵈᵉ sotelte\r\nwas a castel, and seint George, and the kynges doughter ledynge the\r\nlambe in at the castel gates. And all these sotelties were served to the\r\nemperor, and to the kyng, and no ferther: and other lordes were served\r\nwith other sotelties after theire degrees[915].’ The representation,\r\nthen, was in cake or marchpane. The term ‘soteltie’ is surely not\r\nuncommon[916]. But it has led a French scholar into another curious\r\nmistake. According to M. E. Picot ‘La sotelty paraît n’avoir été qu’une\r\nsimple farce, comme la sotternie néerlandaise[917].’ A mumming by Lydgate\r\nin 1429-30 seems to have introduced a ‘miracle’ of St. Clotilda and the\r\nHoly Ampulla (cf. vol. i. p. 397).\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHAM, ESSEX.\r\n\r\n‘Barnaby Riche of Witham’ hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe in 1566.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITTERSHAM, KENT.\r\n\r\nWittersham players were at New Romney in 1426 and Lydd in 1441.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODHAM WALTER, ESSEX.\r\n\r\n‘Mrs. Higham of Woodham Walter’ hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe in\r\n1570-2.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODKIRK, YORKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nSee _Texts_, (i) _Towneley Plays_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORCESTER, WORCESTERSHIRE.\r\n\r\nA cathedral inventory of 1576 includes:—\r\n\r\n    ‘players gere\r\n\r\n    A gowne of freres gyrdles.

It consisted\r\nof five pageants, maintained by the crafts, and was held yearly, if the\r\ncorporation so decided. In 1584 a lease of the ‘vacant place where the\r\npagantes do stand’ was granted for building, and there was a building\r\nknown as the ‘Pageant House’ until 1738[919].\r\n\r\n\r\nWREXHAM, DENBIGHSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe corporation of Shrewsbury saw a play by ‘quibusdam interlusoribus de\r\nWrexam’ in 1540 (Appendix E, vi).\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITTLE, ESSEX.\r\n\r\n‘Parker of Writtell’ twice hired the Chelmsford (q.v.) wardrobe during\r\n1570-2.

According to\r\nAlexander Neville, the ‘ludi ac spectacula ... antiquitus ita instituta’\r\nlasted two days and nights; according to Holinshed, ‘one day and one\r\nnight at least[921].’\r\n\r\n\r\nYARMOUTH, NORFOLK.\r\n\r\nThe churchwardens’ accounts of St. Nicholas’s contain items between 1462\r\nand 1512 for ‘making a new star,’ ‘leading the star,’ ‘a new balk line to\r\nthe star and ryving the same star.’ In 1473 and 1486 are mentioned plays\r\non Corpus Christi day; in 1489, a play at Bartholomew tide; in 1493, a\r\ngame played on Christmas day[922].\r\n\r\n\r\nYORK, YORKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n    [_Authorities._—The chief are R.

In 1397 Richard II was present to view the plays. In 1415 the\r\ntown clerk, Roger Burton, entered in the _Liber Memorandorum_ a copy of\r\nthe _Ordo paginarum ludi Corporis Christi_, which was a schedule of the\r\ncrafts and their plays, together with the _Proclamacio ludi corporis\r\ncristi facienda in vigilia corporis cristi_. At this date the plays were\r\ngiven _annuatim_. About 1440 the existing manuscript of the plays was\r\nprobably written. It was a ‘register,’ drawn up from the ‘regynalls’ or\r\n‘origenalls’ in the possession of the several crafts, and kept by the\r\ncity[924]. Halfway through the sixteenth century performances become\r\nirregular. In 1535 the Creed play, in 1558 the Paternoster play was given\r\ninstead. In 1548 ‘certen pagyauntes ... that is to say, the deyng of our\r\nlady, the assumption of our lady, and the coronacion of our lady,’ were\r\ncast out. In 1550 and 1552 the play was suppressed on account of the\r\nplague, half the ‘pageant silver’ in 1552 being given to the sick. In\r\n1562 the corporation attempted in vain to defer it to St. Barnabas day.\r\nIn 1564, 1565, and 1566 it was not given, on account of war and sickness.\r\nIn 1568 there was a dispute as to whether it should be played, and it was\r\nordered that it must be ‘perused and otherwaise amended’ first. In 1569\r\nit was given on Whit-Tuesday. It then seems to have lain dormant until\r\n1579, when the Council made an order that it should be played but ‘first\r\nthe booke shalbe caried to my Lord Archebisshop [Edwin Sandys] and Mr.\r\nDeane [Mathew Hutton] to correcte, if that my Lord Archebisshop doo well\r\nlike theron.’ Various notes upon the ‘register,’ addressed to a ‘Doctor,’\r\nand indicating that this or that play had been revised, were probably\r\nwritten at this time. In 1580 the citizens petitioned for the play, and\r\nthe mayor replied that the request would be considered. There is no proof\r\nthat any performance took place after this date; although the Bakers were\r\nstill choosing ‘pageant-masters’ in 1656[925].\r\n\r\nThe ordering of the plays about 1415 was as follows: Yearly in the first\r\nor second week in Lent, the town clerk copied the ‘sedulae paginarum’\r\nfrom the _Ordo_ in the _Liber Memorandorum_ and delivered it to the\r\ncrafts ‘per vj servientes maioris ad clavam.’ On the eve of Corpus\r\nChristi a proclamation of mayor and sheriffs forbade ‘distorbaunce of\r\nthe kynges pees, and ye play, or hynderyng of ye processioun of Corpore\r\nChristi.’ It went on to direct that the pageants must be played at\r\nthe assigned places, that the men of the crafts are to come forth in\r\ncustomary array and manner, ‘careynge tapers of ye pagentz,’ that there\r\nshall be provided ‘good players, well arayed and openly spekyng,’ and\r\nthat all shall be ready to start ‘at the mydhowre betwix iiijᵗʰ and vᵗʰ\r\nof the cloke in the mornynge, and then all oyer pageantz fast followyng\r\nilk one after oyer as yer course is, without tarieng.’ Fines are imposed\r\nfor any neglect or failure. At this date the play and the Corpus Christi\r\nprocession were on the same day. In 1426 it is recorded that a Franciscan\r\npreacher, William Melton, while commending the play, ‘affirmando quod\r\nbonus erat in se et laudabilis valde,’ urged that it should be put\r\non the day before Corpus Christi, so as not to interfere with the\r\necclesiastical feast[926]. This seems to have been agreed to, but the\r\narrangement did not last. The procession was under the management of a\r\nCorpus Christi guild, founded in 1408, and the statutes of this guild\r\ndated in 1477 show that it was then the procession which was displaced,\r\nfalling on the Friday after Corpus Christi day[927].\r\n\r\nThus the plays were essentially the affair of the whole community, and\r\nthe control of them by the mayor and council may be further illustrated.\r\nIn 1476 the council made an order regulating the choice of actors, and\r\nlaid down—\r\n\r\n‘That yerely in the tyme of lentyn there shall be called afore the maire\r\nfor the tyme beyng iiij of the moste connyng discrete and able players\r\nwithin this Citie, to serche, here, and examen all the plaiers and plaies\r\nand pagentes thrughoute all the artificers belonging to Corpus Xᵗⁱ Plaie.\r\nAnd all suche as thay shall fynde sufficiant in personne and connyng, to\r\nthe honour of the Citie and worship of the saide Craftes, for to admitte\r\nand able; and all other insufficiant personnes, either in connyng, voice,\r\nor personne to discharge, ammove, and avoide. And that no plaier that\r\nshall plaie in the saide Corpus Xᵗⁱ plaie be conducte and reteyned to\r\nplaie but twise on the day of the saide playe; and that he or thay so\r\nplaing plaie not ouere twise the saide day, vpon payne of xlˢ to forfet\r\nvnto the chaumbre as often tymes as he or thay shall be founden defautie\r\nin the same.’\r\n\r\nBy ‘twise’ is probably meant ‘in two distinct pageants’; for each pageant\r\nrepeated its performance at several stations. In 1394 these stations were\r\n‘antiquitus assignatis.’ In 1399 the commons petitioned the council to\r\nthe effect that ‘le juer et les pagentz de la jour de corpore cristi’\r\nwere not properly performed on account of the number of stations, and\r\nthese were limited to twelve. In later years there were from twelve\r\nto sixteen, and from 1417 the corporation made a profit by letting to\r\nprominent citizens the right to have stations opposite their houses.\r\nA list of ‘Leases for Corpuscrysty Play’ in 1554, for instance, shows\r\ntwelve stations bringing in from xiijᵈ to iijˢ iiijᵈ each, while nothing\r\nwas charged for the places ‘at the Trinitie yaits where the clerke kepys\r\nthe register,’ ‘at the comon Hall to my Lord Maior and his bredren,’ ‘at\r\nMr. Bekwyth’s at Hosyerlane end, where as my Lady Mayres and her systers\r\nlay’ and ‘uppon the Payment.’\r\n\r\nOutward signs of the civic control were the ‘vexilla ludi cum armis\r\ncivitatis,’ which were set up at the stations by order of the mayor on\r\nCorpus Christi eve. Apparently the city claimed also to put its mark\r\non the pageants themselves, for in an agreement of 1422 merging the\r\npageants of the Shoemakers, Tilemakers, Hayresters, and Millers it was\r\ndeclared, ‘quod nulla quatuor artium praedictarum ponet aliqua signa,\r\narma, vel insignia super paginam praedictam, nisi tantum arma huius\r\nhonorabilis civitatis.’ But the more important crafts, who had a pageant\r\nto themselves, may not have been subject to this restriction.\r\n\r\nAlthough the corporation profited from the ‘dimissio locorum ludi\r\nCorporis Christi,’ they did not meet many of the expenses. They paid\r\nfor the services of the minstrels employed, and for refreshments for\r\nthemselves and for important visitors to the town. They occasionally\r\nhelped out the resources of a poor craft. The following extract from the\r\nChamberlains’ accounts for 1397 seems to be quite exceptional:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Expens’ in festo de Corpore Xp’ i.\r\n\r\n    Item: pro steyning de iiijᵒʳ pannos ad opus paginae, iiijˢ.\r\n\r\n    Et pro pictura paginae, ijˢ.\r\n\r\n    Et pro vexillo novo cum apparatu, xijˢ ijᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et in portacione et reportacione meremii ad barras coram Rege,\r\n    ijˢ jᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et pro xx fursperres ad barras praedictas coram Rege, vˢ xᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et pro xix sapplynges emptis de Iohanne de Craven pro barris\r\n    praedictis, vjˢ viijᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et viij portitoribus ducentibus et moventibus paginam, vˢ iiijᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et Ianitori Sanctae Trinitatis pro pagina hospitanda, iiijᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et ludentibus, iiijᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et ministrallis in festo de Corpore Xp’i, xiijˢ iiijᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et in pane, cervisiis, vino, et carnibus, et focalibus pro\r\n    maiore et probis hominibus in die ad ludum, xviijˢ viijᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et in ministrallis domini Regis ac aliorum dominorum\r\n    supervenientibus, vijˡⁱ vijˢ iiijᵈ.\r\n\r\n    Et ministris camerae in albo panno et rubeo pro adventu Regis,\r\n    lviijˢ xᵈ.’\r\n\r\nCertainly the corporation did not themselves provide a ‘pagina’ in\r\n1415 or later years. I think that in 1397 they prepared one for some\r\nallegorical performance of welcome, distinct from the play itself, to\r\nRichard II. The king was evidently placed at the gate of Trinity Priory,\r\nwhere was the first station as late as 1569.\r\n\r\nBut the bulk of the cost fell upon the crafts. They had to build, repair,\r\ndecorate, and draw the pageant (Latin, _pagina_; English, _pagiaunt_,\r\n_paiaunt_, _pachent_, _pagende_, _pagyant_, _padgin_, _padgion_,\r\n_paidgion_, _padzhand_, &c., &c.). They had to house it in one of the\r\n‘pageant howses’ which until recently gave a name to ‘Pageant green,’\r\nand for each of which a yearly rent of xijᵈ seems to have been the\r\nusual charge. They had also doubtless to provide dress and refresh the\r\nactors; and some of their members were bound personally to conduct the\r\npageant on its journey. The fully organized craft-guilds appointed\r\nannual ‘pageant-masters,’ and met the ordinary charges by a levy of\r\n‘pageant-silver’ upon each member according to his status. The amounts\r\nvaried from 1_d._ to 8_d._, and were supplemented by the proceeds of\r\nfines and payments on admissions and on setting up shop. Smaller guilds\r\nwere often grouped together, and produced one pageant amongst three or\r\nfour of them. Even the unincorporated trades did not escape. In 1483\r\nfour Innholders undertook the responsibility of producing a pageant for\r\neight years on condition of a fixed payment of 4_d._ from each innholder\r\nin the city. Exceptional expenses were sometimes met in exceptional\r\nways. The Mercers gave free admission into their fraternity to one\r\nThomas Drawswerd, on condition that he should ‘mak the Pagiant of the\r\nDome ... of newe substanciale for vij marks and the old pageant.’[928]\r\nIn 1501 the Cartwrights made four new wheels to a pageant, and were\r\nthereupon discharged from further charges for 6_d._ a year. Evidently the\r\nobligation of producing a pageant was considered an onerous one, and as\r\ntrades rose and fell in York, the incidence of it upon this or that trade\r\nor trades was frequently altered. All such rearrangements came before\r\nthe civic authorities, and many of them are upon record. Naturally they\r\ninvolved some corresponding revision, piecing together, or splitting up\r\nof plays (cf. p. 412). I only find one example of a play produced by any\r\nother body than a craft. The Hospital of St. Leonard produced the play of\r\nthe Purification in 1415, but had ceased to do so some time before 1477.\r\nIt is to be noted that in 1561 the Minstrels took their place with the\r\nother crafts, and became responsible for the Herod play[929].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pater-Noster Play._\r\n\r\nWyclif in his _De Officio Pastorali_, cap. 15 (1378), says that,—\r\n\r\n‘herfore freris han tauȝt in Englond þe Paternoster in Engliȝcsh tunge,\r\nas men seyen in þe pleye of Yorke[930].’ The reference here is to a\r\nperformance distinct from the Corpus Christi play. The preamble to a\r\nreturn of the ordinances and so forth of the guild ‘Orationis Domini,’\r\nmade in 1389, states that\r\n\r\n‘Once upon a time, a Play setting forth the goodness of the Lord’s Prayer\r\nwas played in the city of York; in which play all manner of vices and\r\nsins were held up to scorn, and the virtues were held up to praise.’\r\n\r\nThe guild was formed to perpetuate this play, and the members were bound\r\nto produce it and accompany it through the streets. In 1389 they had no\r\npossessions beyond the properties of the play and a chest. A _computus_\r\nof the guild for 1399 contains an entry of an old debt of 2_s._ 2_d._,\r\nowed by John Downom and his wife for entrance fee:—\r\n\r\n‘Sed dictus Iohannes dicit se expendisse in diuersis expensis circa\r\nludum Accidiae ex parte Ric. Walker ijˢ jᵈ, ideo de praedicto petit\r\nallocari[931].’\r\n\r\nIt would appear that by 1488 the guild had been converted to or absorbed\r\nin a guild of the Holy Trinity, which was moreover the craft-guild of\r\nthe Merchants or Mercers. Certainly in that year this guild chose four\r\npageant-masters to bring forth the Paternoster play. They were to bring\r\nin the pageants ‘within iiij days next after Corpus Christi Day[932].’ In\r\n1488 the Paternoster play was presumably a variant for the usual Corpus\r\nChristi plays. It was similarly played on Corpus Christi day in 1558. The\r\nmanagement was in the hands of one of the few unsuppressed guilds, that\r\nof St. Anthony; but the corporation gathered ‘pageant silver’ from the\r\ncrafts and met the charges. A ‘bayn,’ or messenger, rode to proclaim the\r\nplay on St. George’s day, and another on Whit Monday. Another performance\r\ntook place on Corpus Christi day (now called ‘Thursday next after\r\nTrinitie Sonday’), 1572. The book was ‘perused, amended and corrected.’\r\nNevertheless, on July 30 the council sent a ‘trewe copie’ of it, at\r\nhis request, to the Archbishop [Grindal] of York, and although in 1575\r\nthey sent a deputation to urge him to appoint a commission to reform\r\n‘all suche the play bookes as perteyne this cittie now in his grace’s\r\ncustodie,’ there is no proof that his grace complied.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Creed Play._\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the guild of Corpus Christi had nothing to do with the\r\nregular craft-plays. But in 1446, William Revetor, a chantry priest and\r\nwarden of the guild, bequeathed to it a ‘ludus incomparabilis’ called\r\nthe ‘Crede play,’ to be performed every tenth year ‘in variis locis\r\ndictae civitatis.’ An inventory of 1465 includes:—\r\n\r\n‘Liber vocatus Originale continens Articulos Fidei Catholicae in lingua\r\nanglicana, nuper scriptum, appreciatum xˡⁱ.\r\n\r\nEt alius liber inveteratus de eodem ludo, cˢ.\r\n\r\nEt alius liber de eodem anglice vocatus _Crede Play_ continens xxij\r\nquaternos.’\r\n\r\nThere were also many banners and properties, amongst which\r\n\r\n‘Et xij rotulae nuper scriptae cum articulis fidei catholicae, apprec’\r\niijˢ iiijᵈ.\r\n\r\nEt una clavis pro sancto Petro cum ij peciis unius tunicae depictae,\r\napprec’ xijᵈ.\r\n\r\nEt x diademata pro Xp’o et apostolis cum una larva et aliis novem\r\ncheverons, vjˢ.’\r\n\r\nVarious performances of the Creed play are recorded. In 1483 it was given\r\non Sunday, September 7, before Richard III, by order of the Council,\r\n‘apon the cost of the most onest men of every parish in thys Cite.’ From\r\n1495 decennial performances can be traced, generally about Lammas (August\r\n1), and ‘at the common hall.’ In 1535 the Corpus Christi play proper was\r\nomitted, and the crafts contributed ‘pageant silver’ to the Creed play\r\nat Lammas. But they refused to give way to it again in 1545. The guild\r\nwas suppressed in 1547, and the ‘original or regestre’ passed into the\r\nhands of the hospital of St. Thomas. In 1562 the corporation proposed the\r\nCreed play as a possible alternative for ‘th’ ystories of the old and\r\nnew testament’ on St. Barnabas day; and in 1568 they again designed to\r\nreplace the regular Corpus Christi play by it. But first they submitted\r\nit to the Dean of York, Matthew Hutton, who, in a letter still extant,\r\nadvised that—\r\n\r\n‘thogh it was plawsible to yeares ago, and wold now also of the ignorant\r\nsort be well liked, yet now in this happie time of the gospell, I knowe\r\nthe learned will mislike it, and how the state will beare with it, I\r\nknowe not.’\r\n\r\nConsequently the book was ‘delyveryd in agayn,’ and no more is heard of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. Davies suggests that the play probably fell into twelve scenes, in\r\neach of which one of the apostles figured. If so, there is perhaps an\r\nallusion to a performance of it in a letter of Henry VIII to the justices\r\nof York in which he speaks of a riot which took place—\r\n\r\n‘at the acting of a religious interlude of St. Thomas the Apostle made\r\nin the said city on the 23ʳᵈ of August now last past ... owing to the\r\nseditious conduct of certain papists who took a part in preparing for the\r\nsaid interlude.’\r\n\r\nHe requires them to imprison any who in ‘performing interludes which are\r\nfounded on any portions of the Old or New Testament’ use language tending\r\nto a breach of the peace[933].\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. George Riding._\r\n\r\nIn April, 1554, the Council made an order for ‘Seynt George to be brought\r\nforth and ryde as hath been accustomed,’ and the following items in the\r\naccounts show that the personages in the procession were much the same as\r\nat Dublin (q.v.):—\r\n\r\n‘to the waites for rydyng and playing before St. George and the play.’\r\n\r\n‘to the porters for beryng of the pagyant, the dragon and St. Xp’ofer.’\r\n\r\n‘to the King and Quene [of Dele] that playd.’\r\n\r\n‘to the May [the Maid].’\r\n\r\n‘to John Stamper for playing St. George[934].’\r\n\r\n\r\n_Midsummer Show._\r\n\r\nAs the regular plays waned, the ‘show’ or ‘watch’ of armed men on\r\nMidsummer eve became important. There is an ordinance for it in 1581. In\r\n1584 it took place in the morning, and in the afternoon John Grafton,\r\na schoolmaster, gave at seven stations a play with ‘certaine compiled\r\nspeaches,’ for which the council allowed him to have ‘a pageant\r\nframe.’ Apparently the Baker’s pageant was repaired for the purpose.\r\nIn 1585 Grafton borrowed the pageants of the Skinners, Cooks, Tailors,\r\nInnholders, Bakers, and Dyers, and gave another play. Grafton’s account\r\nfor 1585 mentions ‘the hearse,’ ‘the angell,’ ‘the Queene’s crowne,’\r\n‘the childe one of the furyes bare.’ He got iijˢ, vjˢ, viijᵈ for his\r\npains[935].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTEXTS OF MEDIAEVAL PLAYS AND EARLY TUDOR INTERLUDES\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

The creation of yᵉ worlde.\r\n    iii. Noah & his shipp.\r\n     iv. Abraham & Isacke.\r\n      v. Kinge Balack & Balaam with Moyses.\r\n     vi. Natiuytie of our Lord.\r\n    vii.

Antecriste.\r\n    xxv. Domes Daye.\r\n\r\nThe list of plays contained in the pre-Reformation Banns is the same as\r\nthis, with one exception. Instead of twenty-five plays it has twenty-six.\r\nAfter _Wyt Sonday_ is inserted the play ‘of our lady thassumpcon,’ to be\r\nbrought forth by ‘the worshipfull wyves of this towne.’ This play of _The\r\nAssumption_ was given in 1477, and as a separate performance in 1488,\r\n1497, and 1515 (Morris, 308, 322, 323). Doubtless it was dropped, as at\r\nYork, out of Protestantism. The post-Reformation Banns and the extant\r\nMSS. of the cycle have it not. Further, they reduce the twenty-five plays\r\nof the ‘White Book’ list to twenty-four, by merging the plays of the\r\n_Scourging_ and _Crucifixion_ into one. In MSS. B, W, h, the junction is\r\nplainly apparent (see Deimling, i. ix; Wright, ii. 50). In MS. H there is\r\nno break (Deimling, i. xxiv).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Literary Relations._\r\n\r\nWright, i. xiv, and Hohlfeld, in _Anglia_, xi. 223, call attention to\r\nthe parallels between the Chester plays and the French _Mystère du Viel\r\nTestament_ and to the occurrence in them of scraps and fragments of\r\nFrench speech. The chief of these are put into the mouths of Octavian,\r\nthe _Magi_, Herod, and Pilate, and may have been thought appropriate\r\nto kings and lordings. They may also point to translation from French\r\noriginals. Davidson, 254, suggests that the earliest performances at\r\nChester were in Anglo-Norman, and points to the tradition of MS. H (cf.\r\np. 351) as confirming this. There are slight traces of influence upon\r\nsome of the Chester plays by the York cycle (Hohlfeld, loc. cit. 260;\r\nDavidson, 287). Hohlfeld, in _M.L.N._ v. 222, regards Chester play iv as\r\nderived from a common original with the Brome _Abraham and Isaac_. H.\r\nUngemacht, _Die Quellen der fünf ersten Chester Plays_, discusses the\r\nrelation of the plays to the Brome play and the French _mystères_, and\r\nalso to the _Vulgate_, the Fathers, Josephus, and the _Cursor Mundi_.\r\n\r\n\r\nYORK PLAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscripts._\r\n\r\n(i) _Brit.

The\r\nfragment of a later play on _The Coronation of Our Lady_ was added at the\r\nend of the fifteenth century. It was doubtless intended to supersede\r\nxlvii. _Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden_ (iv) and _The Purification of\r\nMary, Simeon and Anna prophesy_ (xli) were inserted in 1558. The former\r\nis probably of the same date as the rest; the latter is thought by the\r\neditor to be later. It is misplaced both in the MS. and the printed text.\r\nIt should follow xvii, but there was no room for it in the MS. Some\r\nnotes, probably written when the plays were submitted to the Dean of York\r\nin 1579, state that xii, xviii, xxi, xxviii had been rewritten since the\r\nregister was compiled.\r\n\r\nThe register does not represent quite all the plays ever performed at\r\nYork. Spaces are left for _The Marriage at Cana_ and _Christ in the House\r\nof Simon the Leper_, which were never written in; and the corporation\r\narchives refer to a play of _Fergus_ or _Portacio Corporis Mariae_,\r\nwhich came between xlv and xlvi and was ‘laid apart’ in 1485; and to a\r\nscene of _Suspencio Iudae_, which was in 1422 an episode of xxxiii. In\r\nother respects the contents of the register agree substantially with\r\nthe fifty-one plays of the _Ordo paginarum_ entered by the Town Clerk\r\nin the _Liber Memorandorum_ in 1415[936] and with the fifty-seven plays\r\nof a second _Ordo_ of uncertain date which comes a little later in the\r\nsame _Liber_[937]. The three lists show some variations in the grouping\r\nof the subject-matter into pageants, due to the constant shifting of\r\nresponsibility amongst the crafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Literary Relations._\r\n\r\nDavidson, 252 sqq., attempts to trace the growth of the York plays out\r\nof a parent cycle, from which the Towneley and Coventry plays borrowed.\r\nThe biblical and apocryphal sources are discussed by L. Toulmin Smith,\r\n_York Plays_, xlvii; A. R. Hohlfeld, in _Anglia_, xi. 285; P. Kamann,\r\n_Die Quellen der York-Spiele_, in _Anglia_, x. 189; F. Holthausen, in\r\n_Arch. f. d.

Plays iii, v, vi, xiii (_Processus Noe_, _Isaac_, _Iacob_,\r\n_Secunda Pastorum_) from (i); Manly, i. 13, 58, 94.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cycle._\r\n\r\nThere are thirty-two extant plays, as follows:—\r\n\r\n       i. The Creation (The Barkers, Wakefeld).\r\n      ii. Mactacio Abel (The Glovers).\r\n     iii. Processus Noe cum filiis (Wakefeld).\r\n      iv. Abraham (incomplete).\r\n       v. [Isaac].\r\n      vi. Iacob.\r\n     vii. Processus Prophetarum (incomplete).\r\n    viii. Pharao (the Litsters or Dyers).\r\n      ix. Cesar Augustus.\r\n       x. Annunciacio.\r\n      xi. Salutacio Elezabeth.\r\n     xii. Una pagina Pastorum (Prima).\r\n    xiii. Alia eorundem (Secunda).\r\n     xiv. Oblacio Magorum.\r\n      xv. Fugacio Iosep & Mariae in Egyptum.\r\n     xvi. Magnus Herodes.\r\n    xvii. Purificacio Mariae (incomplete at end).\r\n   xviii. Pagina Doctorum (incomplete at beginning).\r\n     xix. Iohannes Baptista.\r\n      xx. Conspiracio (et Capcio).\r\n     xxi. Coliphizacio.\r\n    xxii. Fflagellacio.\r\n   xxiii. Processus Crucis (et Crucifixio).\r\n    xxiv. Processus Talentorum.\r\n     xxv. Extraccio Animarum.\r\n    xxvi. Resurreccio Domini.\r\n   xxvii. Peregrini (the Fishers).\r\n  xxviii. Thomas Indiae (et Resurreccio Domini).\r\n    xxix. Ascencio Domini (incomplete).\r\n     xxx. Iudicium.\r\n    xxxi. Lazarus.\r\n   xxxii. Suspencio Iudae (incomplete).\r\n\r\nPlays xxxi and xxxii (a fragment) are obviously misplaced. The former\r\nshould come between xix and xx; the latter, which is added to the MS. in\r\nan early sixteenth-century hand, between xxii and xxiii. Probably two\r\nplays at least are lost. Twelve leaves are missing after Play i, and\r\ntwelve more after Play xxix. These doubtless contained plays of _The\r\nFall_ and _Pentecost_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Literary Relations._\r\n\r\nThe Towneley Cycle is a composite one (Ten Brink, ii. 257; iii. 274;\r\nDavidson, 253; England-Pollard, xxi). Mr. Pollard distinguishes\r\nthree fairly well-marked strata, and this classification is probably\r\nnot exhaustive. There are (a) a group of plays of the ordinary\r\ndidactico-religious type; (b) a group derived from the York plays in\r\nan earlier form than the extant text; (c) a group written by a single\r\nwriter of marked power and a bold sense of humour. The plays of this\r\ngroup include iii, xii, xiii, xiv, xxi, and are, for literary quality,\r\nthe pick of the vernacular religious drama. Mr. Pollard considers the\r\ncycle practically complete by about 1420. The horned female headdress\r\n(xxx. 269) which led the Surtees editor to put the composition in 1388,\r\nis found in miniatures of the later date. The relation of the cycle to\r\nthat of York is also studied by Davidson, 271 sqq., and A. R. Hohlfeld,\r\nin _Anglia_, xi. 253, 285. Ten Brink, ii. 244; iii. 274, thinks that a\r\nmuch earlier (late thirteenth century) play is preserved in Plays v and\r\nvi (_Isaac_ and _Iacob_). I agree with Mr. Pollard that this conjecture\r\nlacks proof.\r\n\r\nA. Ebert has a study, _Die englischen Mysterien, mit besonderer\r\nBerücksichtigung der Townley-Sammlung_, in _Jahrbuch f. rom. u. engl.\r\nLit._ i. 44, 131. The folk-lore incident of the _Secunda Pastorum_ is\r\nsupplied with parallels by E. Kölbing, in England-Pollard, xxxi, and\r\nby H. A. Eaton, in _M.L.N._ xiv. 265, from _The Merry Tales of Gotham_\r\n(H. Oesterley, _A Hundred Merry Tales_ (1526), No. xxiv; Hazlitt,\r\n_Shakespeare’s Jest-Books_, iii. 4). There is an allusion to the ‘foles\r\nof Gotham,’ in Play xii. 180. J. Hugienen, in _M.L.N._ xiv. 255, finds in\r\nPlay iv. 49 an adaptation of the French _Viel Testament_, 9511.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Locality._\r\n\r\nDouce described the manuscript for the sale of Towneley MSS. in 1814 as\r\nsupposed to have ‘belonged to the Abbey of Widkirk, near Wakefield, in\r\nthe county of York.’ In his Roxburghe Club edition of the _Iudicium_ he\r\nsubstitutes the name of the Abbey of Whalley, near Towneley Hall. How\r\nfar either of these statements or conjectures rests upon Towneley family\r\ntradition is unknown. Widkirk is merely another form (cf. Prof. Skeat,\r\nin _Athenæum_ for Dec. 2, 1893) of Woodkirk, also called West Ardsley,\r\na small place four miles north of Wakefield. There was not, strictly\r\nspeaking, an abbey at Woodkirk, but a small cell of Augustinian canons,\r\ndependent upon the great house of St. Oswald at Nostel.\r\n\r\nThe MS. itself seems to bear witness to a connexion of the plays with the\r\ncrafts of Wakefield. Play i is headed ‘Assit Principio, Sancta Maria,\r\nMeo. Wakefeld.’ In the margin of Play ii is written ‘Glover Pag.’ in a\r\nlater hand. Play iii is headed ‘Processus Noe cum filiis. Wakefeld.’ In\r\nthe margin of Play viii is ‘Litsters Pagonn’ in a later hand, and further\r\ndown, in a third hand, is ‘lyster play.’ Under the title of Play xxvii\r\nis ‘fysher pagent’ in a later hand. Further in Play xiii is a mention\r\nof ‘Horbury Shroges,’ Horbury being a village two or three miles from\r\nWakefield, and a ‘crokyd thorne’ which may be a ‘Shepherd’s Thorn’ near\r\nHorbury in Mapplewell. These indications are spread over the three groups\r\nof plays distinguished by Mr. Pollard, and certainly suggest that the\r\nwhole cycle belonged to the Wakefield crafts. On the other hand, I find\r\nno hint of any plays in the local histories of Wakefield. The evidence\r\nfor a connexion with Wakefield is strengthened by M. H. Peacock, _The\r\nWakefield Mysteries_, in _Anglia_, xxiv. 509, from which it appears\r\nthat there are places called Thornhill and Thornes to the E. and W.\r\nrespectively of Horbury. Play ii, line 367 ‘bery me in gudeboure at the\r\nquarell hede’ points to Goodybower Close in Wakefield, which once had a\r\nquarry. Play xxiv, line 155 ‘from this towne vnto lyn’ suggests at least\r\na borrowing from East Anglia.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may combine the data of the manuscript and of tradition by\r\nsupposing that the plays were acted by the crafts of Wakefield, not\r\nin the town at Corpus Christi or Whitsuntide, but at one of the great\r\nfairs which the canons of Nostel held under charter at Woodkirk about\r\nthe feasts of the Assumption (Aug. 15) and the Nativity (Sept. 8) of the\r\nVirgin. These fairs, run into one continuous horse fair, and known from a\r\nlocal family of Legh, as Lee fair, lasted until quite recently[938].\r\n\r\n\r\nLUDUS COVENTRIAE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscript._\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus. Cotton MS. Vespasian_ D. viii. Forty-two plays, the last\r\nincomplete. On f. 100ᵛ is the date 1468. At the beginning is written\r\n‘Robert Hegge, Dunelmensis’ and before the twenty-ninth play ‘Ego R.\r\nH. Dunelmensis, Possideo: Ου κτησις αλλα χρησις.’ On the fly-leaf, in\r\nan Elizabethan hand, is ‘The plaie called Corpus Christi,’ and in the\r\nhand of Cotton’s librarian, Richard James, ‘Contenta Novi Testamenti\r\nscenice expressa et actitata olim per monachos sive fratres mendicantes:\r\nvulgo dicitur hic liber Ludus Coventriae, sive ludus Corporis Christi:\r\nscribitur metris Anglicanis.’ The following account was given by a later\r\nlibrarian, Dr. Smith, in his printed catalogue (1696) of the Cottonian\r\nMSS.: ‘A collection of plays, in Old English metre: h.e. Dramata sacra,\r\nin quibus exhibentur historiae veteris & N. Testamenti, introductis quasi\r\nin scenam personis illic memoratis quas secum invicem colloquentes pro\r\ningenio finget Poeta. Videntur olim coram populo, sive ad instruendum\r\nsive ad placendum, a Fratribus mendicantibus representata.’\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n(a) 1830. Plays i-v (_Fall of Lucifer_, _Days of Creation and Fall of\r\nAdam_, _Cain and Abel_, _Noah’s Flood_, _Abraham and Isaac_) in Dugdale,\r\n_Monasticon Anglicanum_ (ed. 2). vi, pt. 3, 1534.\r\n\r\n(b) 1836. Play x (_Betrothal of Mary_), Collier, _Five Miracle-Plays_.\r\n\r\n(c) 1838. Plays xii, xiv (_Doubt of Joseph_, _Trial of Mary_), William\r\nMarriott, _English Miracle-Plays_.\r\n\r\n(d) 1841. Cycle: J. O. Halliwell[-Phillipps] for Shakespeare Society.\r\n\r\n(e) 1890. Play xi (_Annunciation_), Pollard, 44.\r\n\r\n(f) 1897. Plays iv, xi (_Noah’s Flood_, _Annunciation_), Manly, i. 31, 82.\r\n\r\n(g) A new edition of the complete cycle is promised in the ‘Extra Series’\r\nof the Early English Text Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cycle._\r\n\r\nThe text is not definitely divided up into plays in the MS., although\r\nsome such indication as an _Explicit_ occasionally helps. Probably the\r\nfollowing division is correct. Halliwell’s is clearly wrong, but for\r\nconvenience of reference I give his numbers in brackets.\r\n\r\n        i. Fall of Lucifer (Halliwell, i).\r\n       ii. Days of Creation. Fall of Adam (H. i, ii).\r\n      iii. Cain and Abel (H. iii).\r\n       iv. Noah’s Flood (H. iv).\r\n        v. Abraham and Isaac (H. v).\r\n       vi. Moses (H. vi).\r\n      vii. Prophets (H. vii).\r\n\r\nThen a prologue by Contemplacio, promising a ‘matere’ of ‘the modyr\r\nof mercy’ from her conception to the meeting with Elizabeth, and a\r\n‘conclusyon.’\r\n\r\n     viii. Joachim and Anna (H. viii).\r\n       ix. Mary in the Temple (H. ix).\r\n        x. Betrothal of Mary (H. x).\r\n       xi. Annunciation (H. xi).\r\n\r\nOpens with scene between Contemplacio, Virtutes, Pater, Veritas,\r\nMisericordia, Iusticia, Pax, Filius.\r\n\r\n      xii. Doubt of Joseph (H. xii).\r\n     xiii. Visit to Elizabeth (H. xiii).\r\n\r\nThis group of plays closes with the promised ‘conclusyon,’ namely ‘Ave\r\nregina coelorum,’ and Contemplacio disappears.\r\n\r\n      xiv. Trial of Mary (H. xiv).\r\n       xv. Nativity (H. xv).\r\n      xvi. _Pastores_ (H. xvi).\r\n     xvii. _Magi_ (H. xvii).\r\n    xviii. Purification (H. xviii).\r\n      xix. Slaughter of Innocents (H. xix).\r\n       xx. Death of Herod (H. xix).\r\n      xxi. Dispute in Temple (H. xx).\r\n     xxii. Baptism (H. xxi).\r\n    xxiii. Temptation (H. xxii).\r\n     xxiv. Woman Taken in Adultery (H. xxiii).\r\n      xxv. Lazarus (H. xxiv).\r\n     xxvi. Conspiracy of Jews (H. xxv).\r\n    xxvii. Entry into Jerusalem (H. xxvi).\r\n   xxviii. Last Supper (H. xxvii).\r\n     xxix. Mount of Olives (H. xxviii).\r\n\r\nAnother group of scenes begins. Contemplacio, called in the stage\r\ndirection ‘an exposytour, in doctorys wede,’ reappears; and after a\r\nprocession has ‘enteryd into the place, and the Herowdys taken his\r\nschaffalde and Pylat and Annas and Cayphas here schaffaldys,’ says:—\r\n\r\n  ‘Be the leve and soferauns of allemythty God,\r\n  We intendyn to procede the matere that we lefte the last ȝere;\r\n  ...\r\n  The last ȝere we shewyd here how oure Lord for love of man\r\n  Cam to the cety of Jherusalem mekely his deth to take;\r\n  And how he made his mawndé.\r\n  ...\r\n  Now wold we procede, how he was browth than\r\n  Beforn Annas and Cayphas, and sythe beforn Pylate:\r\n  And so forth in his passyon how mekely he toke it for man.’\r\n\r\nThis group does not well bear splitting up into plays. The action is\r\ncontinuous, although it takes place now at one scaffold, now at another.\r\n\r\n      xxx. Herod desires to see Christ. Trial before Caiaphas (H. xxix,\r\n             xxx).\r\n     xxxi. Death of Judas. Christ before Pilate and Herod (H. xxx).\r\n    xxxii. Pilate’s Wife’s Dream. The Condemnation (H. xxxi, xxxii).\r\n   xxxiii. Crucifixion (H. xxxii, xxxiii).\r\n    xxxiv. Longinus. Burial of Christ (H. xxxiv).\r\n     xxxv. Harrowing of Hell. Resurrection (H. xxxv).\r\n\r\nHere, possibly, the group ends. Then follow:—\r\n\r\n    xxxvi. _Quem quaeritis_ (H. xxxvi).\r\n   xxxvii. _Hortulanus_ (H. xxxvii).\r\n  xxxviii. _Peregrini_ (H. xxxviii).\r\n    xxxix. Incredulity of Thomas (H. xxxviii).\r\n       xl. Ascension (H. xxxix).\r\n      xli. Pentecost (H. xl).\r\n     xlii. Assumption of Virgin (H. xli).\r\n\r\nThe Assumption play, according to Halliwell, is inserted in a hand of the\r\ntime of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n    xliii. Doomsday (H. xlii).\r\n\r\nA few lines appear to be missing at the end.\r\n\r\nIn dividing the plays, I have been helped by a prologue which is put in\r\nthe mouths of three _Vexillatores_. Says _Primus_:—\r\n\r\n  ‘We purpose us pertly stylle in this prese,\r\n    The pepyl to plese with pleys full glad.\r\n  Now lystenyth us, lovely, bothe more and lesse,\r\n    Gentyllys and ȝemanry of goodly lyff lad, This tyde.’\r\n\r\nThe _Vexillatores_ then take turns to describe the ‘ffyrst pagent,’\r\n‘secunde pagent,’ and so on, up to ‘the xlᵗⁱ pagent.’ This should be\r\n‘xlii,’ but by a slip two numbers are used twice. The prologue ends:—\r\n\r\n  ‘A Sunday next, yf that we may,\r\n  At vj of the belle we gynne oure play,\r\n  In N. towne, wherfore we pray,\r\n      That God now be ȝoure spede. _Amen._’\r\n\r\nThe prologue so far agrees with the plays that it must have been written\r\nfor them; but it was not written for them as they stand. It gives some of\r\nthe incidents, especially of the trial scenes, in a different order from\r\nthe text. Plays viii, xiii, xviii, xxvi, and xlii are omitted altogether.\r\nOf these xlii is a late interpolation in the text; but the fact that\r\nthe numbers viii and xiii are skipped over in the enumeration, although\r\nthe order in which the _Vexillatores_ speak proceeds regularly, shows\r\nthat the prologue is later in date than the text, and contemplates the\r\nomission of existing plays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Problem._\r\n\r\nThe exact nature of the _Ludus Coventriae_ is a nice literary point.\r\nIt is much doubted whether they have anything to do with Coventry at\r\nall. Cotton’s librarians regarded them as Coventry plays, acted not\r\nby craft-guilds, but by monks or begging friars. But what was their\r\nauthority? The earliest possessor of the MS. who can be traced is Robert\r\nHegge, a Durham man by birth, and a Fellow of C. C. C., Oxford. Hegge\r\ndied in 1629, and probably the MS. then passed into Sir Robert Cotton’s\r\ncollection through Richard James, who happened to be also a C. C. C. man,\r\nand was in the habit of picking up finds for Cotton in Oxford[939]. The\r\nnote on the MS. may represent a tradition as to its origin gathered by\r\nJames from Hegge.\r\n\r\nWith this note should be compared the following passage in Dugdale’s\r\n_History of Warwickshire_, referring to the house of Franciscans or Grey\r\nFriars at Coventry:—\r\n\r\n‘Before the suppression of the monasteries, this city was very famous\r\nfor the _Pageants_ that were play’d therein, upon _Corpus-Christi_-day;\r\nwhich occasioning very great confluence of people thither from far and\r\nnear, was of no small benefit thereto; which _Pageants_ being acted with\r\nmighty state and reverence by the Friers of this House, had Theaters\r\nfor the severall Scenes, very large and high, placed upon wheels, and\r\ndrawn to all the eminent parts of the City, for the better advantage\r\nof Spectators: And contain’d the story of the New-Testament, composed\r\ninto Old English Rithme, as appeareth by an antient MS. intituled _Ludus\r\nCorporis Christi_ or _Ludus Coventriae_’ [_in bibl._ Cotton, _sub effigie\r\nVesp._ D. 9].\r\n\r\n‘I have been told by some old people, who in their younger years were\r\neye-witnesses of these Pageants so acted, that the yearly confluence of\r\npeople to see that shew was extraordinary great, and yielded no small\r\nadvantage to this City[940].’\r\n\r\nDugdale, it is to be observed, has the MS. as one of his authorities,\r\nbut he goes further than the librarians by ascribing the plays to a\r\nparticular house of friars. Unfortunately his account will not hold\r\nwater. He was born in 1605, and educated for five years in Coventry. Now\r\nthere could have been no plays performed by the Grey Friars after 1538,\r\nfor they were suppressed in that year. But the craft-plays survived,\r\nwith great _éclat_, until 1580, and it is manifest that it is these\r\nplays which his informants described to him. They were acted on Corpus\r\nChristi day, obviously leaving no room for Grey Friars plays on the same\r\nday. The craft-plays seem to have been confined to the history of the\r\nNew Testament (cf. p. 423), but the _Ludus Coventriae_ is not. There\r\nis, however, a not very trustworthy bit of evidence which makes it just\r\npossible that the Grey Friars did act, not at Corpus Christi, but at\r\nWhitsuntide. This is the statement of the Coventry _Annals_ that in\r\n1492-3, Henry VII came to see the plays acted by the Grey Friars[941].\r\nBut the _Annals_ only date from the seventeenth century, and they are\r\nnot trustworthy (cf. p. 358) as to the history of the plays. I incline\r\nto think that the Grey Friars connexion is an Oxford guess of Hegge or\r\nhis friends, which has found its way alike into the accounts of Richard\r\nJames and Dugdale, and into the _Annals_. But is the connexion of the\r\nplays with Coventry also part of the guess, inspired by the fact that\r\nthe Coventry mysteries, and these alone, obtained literary notice in\r\nthe sixteenth century? Or have we Coventry guild-plays to deal with?\r\nThe _Ludus Coventriae_ is quite distinct from the two extant Coventry\r\nplays (p. 422); but those are of the sixteenth century, and appear to\r\nrepresent a recension in 1535 of ‘new plays’ produced, according to the\r\n_Annals_, in 1520 (p. 358). So far as this goes, the _Ludus Coventriae_\r\nmight be the discarded fifteenth-century cycle of the Coventry crafts.\r\nTen Brink points out certain features in the _Ludus_ which seem,\r\nfrom the Cappers’ accounts extracted by Sharp, to have existed also\r\nat Coventry[942]. On the other hand, the Coventry plays, unlike the\r\n_Ludus_, seem to have been confined to the New Testament. The _Ludus_\r\ndoes not give those opportunities for showing off artisanship which are\r\ncharacteristic of other craft-cycles[943]. And, strongest of all, while\r\nthe Coventry plays were processional, a study of the _Ludus_ will make\r\nit quite clear that it was intended for a stationary performance. The\r\n‘pagents’ contemplated by the prologue can only be episodes artificially\r\ndistinguished in a practically continuous action. Often there is no\r\nwell-marked break between pageant and pageant. The same personages appear\r\nand reappear in more than one; and the whole performance evidently takes\r\nplace in and around a ‘place’ or _locus interludii_ (Halliwell, 44) upon\r\nwhich are situated various ‘scaffolds’ or ‘stages[944],’ a heaven, a\r\nhell, a temple, a _sepulchrum_, and so forth. The _navis_ for Noah is\r\npracticable, and can come and go.\r\n\r\nIf the plays are not from Coventry, can they be located elsewhere?\r\nThey have been ascribed to Durham, but merely, I think, because Robert\r\nHegge was ‘Dunelmensis.’ Mr. Pollard follows Ten Brink in assigning\r\ntheir dialect and scribal peculiarities to the North-East Midlands,\r\nand in ascribing them to a strolling company[945]. They regard ‘N.\r\ntowne’ in the prologue as a common form (N = ‘nomen,’ as in the Church\r\nCatechism and Marriage Service). As to the dialect I offer no opinion;\r\nI am sorry not to have been able to see M. Kramer, _Sprache und Heimath\r\nder Coventry-Plays_. But I do not think that the strolling company is\r\nproved. The _vexillatores_ may be merely proclaimers of banns sent round\r\nthe villages hard by the town where the play was given. And ‘N.’ may be\r\nan abbreviation for a definite town name. Northampton (q.v.) has been\r\nsuggested; but would not scan. Norwich (q.v.) would; and these might\r\nconceivably be a cycle played by the guild of St. Luke at Norwich before\r\nthe crafts took the responsibility for the Whitsun plays from it. But the\r\nelaborate treatment of the legends of the Virgin suggests a performance,\r\nlike that of the Lincoln plays, and of the _Massacre of the Innocents_\r\nin the _Digby MS._, on St. Anne’s day (July 26). It is to be observed\r\nthat both these examples are in the E. Midland area to which philologists\r\nassign the text of the _Ludus Coventriae_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Literary Relations._\r\n\r\nTen Brink, ii. 283, calls attention to the composite character of the\r\ncycle, in which groups of various origin are placed side by side without\r\nmuch attempt at imposing a literary unity upon them. He thinks, however,\r\nthat all the plays received their form in the same part of England, and\r\nconsiders the dialect to be that of the North-East Midlands. In a note\r\n(iii. 276) he finds an analogy in the treatment of certain themes between\r\nthe _Ludus Coventriae_ and the Coventry plays proper. Davidson, 259,\r\nthinks that the author might have been ‘connected with one of the great\r\nreligious houses of the Fen District.’ Hohlfeld (_Anglia_, xi. 219) has\r\nsome interesting remarks on the cycle. It may be observed that Plays\r\nxxx-xxxv in my grouping are evidently taken from a cycle of which only\r\na part was given in each year. The _Purification and Presentation in\r\nthe Temple_ of the Digby MS. affords a parallel example. Possibly Plays\r\nviii-xiii in which, as in Plays xxx-xxxv, Contemplacio appears, have the\r\nsame source.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVENTRY PLAYS.\r\n\r\n[See also account of _Ludus Coventriae_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscripts._\r\n\r\nA copy, probably the ‘original’ of the Shearmen and Tailors’ play, was in\r\nthe possession of Thomas Sharp. It is described in a colophon as ‘T[h]ys\r\nmatter nevly correcte by Robert Croo the xiiijᵗʰ day of marche fenysschid\r\nin the yere of owre lorde god MCCCCC & xxxiiijᵗᵉ [1534/5].’ At the end\r\nare three songs, with the date 1591. A similar copy of the Weavers’\r\nplay ‘nevly translate be Robert Croo in the yere of oure Lorde God Mlvᶜ\r\nxxxiiijᵗᵉ ... yendide the seycond day of Marche in yere above sayde,’ was\r\n‘unexpectedly discovered in 1832,’ and a transcript made by Sharp. This\r\nalso has songs at the end, but no date. The collections of Sharp passed\r\ninto the Staunton collection at Longbridge House, and thence into the\r\nShakespeare Memorial Library at Birmingham, where they were burnt in 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n(a) 1817. _Shearmen and Tailors Play._ Thos.

S.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cycle._\r\n\r\nThe _Shearmen and Tailors’ Play_ has a prologue by ‘Isaye the profet.’\r\nThen follow in order, the Annunciation, the Doubt of Joseph, the Journey\r\nto Bethlehem, the Nativity and Shepherds, a dialogue of two ‘Profettis,’\r\nHerod and the Magi, the Flight to Egypt, the Massacre of the Innocents.\r\nThe _Weavers’ Play_ must have followed next in the cycle. It opens with\r\na dialogue of two ‘_Profetae_’. Then come the Presentation in the Temple\r\nand the Dispute with the Elders. The subjects of four of the other plays\r\ncan be pretty clearly identified. The Smiths’ accounts show them to have\r\nplayed the Trial and Crucifixion, to which was added in 1573 the ‘new\r\nplay’ of the Death of Judas; the Descent from the Cross passed through\r\nvarious hands from the Pinners and Needlers in 1414 to the Coopers in\r\n1547; the Cappers’ accounts point to the Resurrection, Harrowing of Hell,\r\nand _Quem quaeritis_, with from 1540 the ‘Castell of Emaus’; and those\r\nof the Drapers to Doomsday. It is difficult to say how many plays remain\r\nunidentified. The crafts were grouped and regrouped, and the total number\r\nof plays may have varied. But it would seem that besides the crafts\r\nalready named, the Mercers, Whittawers, Girdlers, Cardmakers, and Tanners\r\nwere playing in the middle of the fifteenth century. The ‘jest’ quoted on\r\np. 358 points to a Pentecost play with the ‘xij Articles of the Creed,’\r\nsimilar to that of Chester. It is noticeable that no Old Testament play\r\ncan be established at Coventry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Literary Relations._\r\n\r\nThese plays, of which the _Weavers’ Play_ was, until recently, difficult\r\nto procure, have been but little studied. Two communications by C.\r\nDavidson and A. R. Hohlfeld in _Modern Language Notes_, vii. 184, 308,\r\ncall attention to the fact that the larger part of the dialogue in the\r\n_Dispute in the Temple_ scene is practically the same as that common to\r\nthe York, Towneley, and Chester plays (cf. _York Plays_, 158, and A. R.\r\nHohlfeld in _Anglia_, xi. 260).\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscript._\r\n\r\nThe Shipwrights’ Play of _Noah’s Ark_ was in the hands of its first\r\neditor, Henry Bourne; but is not known to be now preserved (Holthausen,\r\n32).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n(a) 1736. _Noah’s Ark; or, The Shipwrights’ Ancient Play or Dirge_; in H.\r\nBourne, _Hist. of Newcastle_, 139.\r\n\r\n(b) 1789.

This he dates, conjecturally, at about 1425-50.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cycle._\r\n\r\nThe Shipwrights’ play deals with the Making of the Ark, but stops short\r\nof the Deluge. The personages are Deus, Angelus, Diabolus, Noah, Uxor\r\nNoah. The subjects of most of the plays of the other crafts can be\r\nrecovered, as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Creation of Adam.\r\n  Noah’s Ark.\r\n  Offering of Isaac.\r\n  Israel in Egypt.\r\n  Kings of Cologne.\r\n  Flight into Egypt.\r\n  Baptism.\r\n  Last Supper.\r\n  Bearing of Cross.\r\n  Burial of Christ.\r\n  Descent into Hell.\r\n  Burial of Our Lady.\r\n\r\nOf these, two, the Creation of Adam and the Flight into Egypt, were\r\nmaintained, in 1454, by one craft, the Bricklayers and Plasterers.\r\nThe Merchant Adventurers, in 1552, paid for ‘fyve playes, whereof\r\nthe towne must pay for the ostmen playe.’ There are six guilds whose\r\nplays are not known; so that the total number may have been as many as\r\ntwenty-three[946].\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the Merchant Adventurers also include in 1554 and 1558\r\ncharges in and about ‘Hoggmaygowyk’ or ‘Hogmagoge[947].’ I do not think,\r\nwith Holthausen, that this was one of the Corpus Christi plays. I think\r\nit was a spring or summer folk-feast. One of the London ‘giants’ is\r\nGogmagog.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWICH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscript._\r\n\r\nThe extracts, made early in the seventeenth century from the Grocers’\r\nBook, and in the possession (1856) of Mr. Fitch, included two versions\r\nof the play of the _Fall_. The first was copied into the Book in 1533.\r\nIt is headed _The Story of yᵉ Creac̄on of Eve, wᵗ yᵉ expellyng of Adam &\r\nEve out of Paradyce_. It ends with a ‘dullfull song,’ perhaps the ‘newe\r\nballet’ paid for in 1534 (cf. p. 388). It appears to have a _lacuna_. The\r\nsecond version is ‘newely renvid & accordynge unto yᵉ Skrypture, begon\r\nthys yere Aᵒ 1565. Aᵒ 7 Eliz.’ It is quite a new text. It is provided\r\nwith two speeches by a Prolocutor, one to be used ‘when yᵉ Grocers\r\nPageant is played wᵗ owte eny other goenge befor yᵗ,’ the other for\r\nuse ‘yf ther goeth eny other Pageants before yᵗ.’ The former speaks of\r\nthe ‘Pageants apparellyd in Wittson dayes’ that ‘lately be fallen into\r\ndecayes.’\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n(a) 1856.

The\r\nfirst ends with the expulsion from Paradise. The _dramatis personae_\r\nare _Pater_, _Adam_, _Eva_, _Serpens_. In the second is added an Angel,\r\nand after the expulsion Adam and Eve depart ‘to yᵉ nether parte of yᵉ\r\nPageants,’ are threatened by _Dolor_ and _Myserye_, and comforted by the\r\n_Holy Ghost_.\r\n\r\nA list, dating probably from 1527, makes it possible to complete the\r\noutline of the cycle[948]:—\r\n\r\n  Creation off the world.\r\n  Paradyse [_Grocers’ play_].\r\n  Helle Carte.\r\n  Abell & Cain.\r\n  Noyse Shipp.\r\n  Abraham & Isaak.\r\n  Moises & Aaron, with the Children of Israel & Pharo with his Knyghts.\r\n  Conflict off David and Golias.\r\n  The Birth off Christ with Shepherds and iij Kyngs of Colen.\r\n  The Baptysme of Criste.\r\n  The Resurrection.\r\n  The Holy Gost.\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM AND ISAAC (Dublin MS.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscript._\r\n\r\n_Trinity College, Dublin, MS._ D. iv. 18, f. 16ᵛ.

Brotanek conjectures from the character of the MS.\r\nthat it belongs to Northampton (cf. p. 386). The dialect appears to be\r\nSouth Midland of about the first half of the fifteenth century, and the\r\ntext to be based on the corresponding play (xi) in the _Viel Testament_\r\n(Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 363).\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM AND ISAAC (Brome MS.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscript._\r\n\r\n‘The Book of Brome,’ a commonplace book of 1470-80 in the possession of\r\nSir Edward Kerrison of Brome Manor, Norfolk.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n(a) 1884.

There is an epilogue by a _Doctor_, but no\r\ntitle or prologue, and nothing to show that it was, or was not, part of a\r\ncycle. The text is probably derived from a common source with that of the\r\ncorresponding Chester play: cf. Pollard, 185; A. R. Hohlfeld, in _M. L.\r\nN._ v. 222.\r\n\r\nF.

Whitley Stokes, in _Transactions of Philological Society_,\r\n1860-1 (Appendix).\r\n\r\n(b) 1897. Manly, i. 239.\r\n\r\nThere is a prologue by two _Vexillatores_, ending—\r\n\r\n  ‘And yᵗ place yow, thys gaderyng that here yˢ,\r\n    At Croxston on Monday yᵗ shall be sen;\r\n  To see the conclusyon of this lytell processe\r\n    Hertely welcum shall yow bene.\r\n  ...\r\n    Now, mynstrell, blow vp with a mery stevyn!’\r\n\r\nThen comes a title: ‘Here after foloweth the Play of the Conversyon of\r\nSer Jonathas the Jewe by Myracle of the Blyssed Sacrament.’ The play is\r\n927 lines long, with occasional lines in Latin. It ends with a _Te Deum_.\r\nThe colophon runs: ‘Thus endyth the Play of the Blyssyd Sacrament, whyche\r\nmyracle was don in the forest of Aragon, in the famous cite Eraclea, the\r\nyere of ower Lord God Mˡcccc.lxi, to whom be honower. Amen!’ This account\r\nof the event on which the play is founded is confirmed by ll. 56-60 of\r\nthe prologue. The date of composition cannot therefore be earlier than\r\n1461, and probably is not much later. After the colophon is a list of\r\nthe _dramatis personae_, who are twelve in all, and the note ‘IX may\r\nplay it at ease,’ signed ‘R.C.’ The name Croxton is common to places in\r\nNorfolk, Cambridgeshire, Leicestershire, and other counties. Further\r\nidentification may perhaps be helped by ll. 540-1—\r\n\r\n  ‘Inquyre to the Colkote, for ther ys hys loggyng,\r\n  A lytylle besyde Babwelle Mylle.’\r\n\r\nThe stage-directions imply a ‘place,’ with ‘stages’ for the chief\r\nplayers, a ‘tabyll,’ and a ‘chyrche’ (ll. 149, 288, 305, 445).\r\n\r\nF.

At the end\r\n(f. 50ᵛ), is ‘ffinis conuercionis sancti pauli.’ There is a prologue,\r\nheaded _Poeta_, against which has been written in a later hand ‘Myles\r\nBlomefylde.’ Schmidt, _Diss._ 6, identifies a Miles Blomefylde as a\r\nmonk of Bury born in 1525. (ii) f. 95. _St. Mary Magdalen_, written in\r\nthe second hand of (i). At the beginning are the initials M.

At the beginning is ‘candelmes day & the kyllynge of the\r\nchildren of Israell, anno domini 151’; at the end ‘Anno domini Millesimo,\r\ncccccxij,’ and after a list of ‘The Namys of the Pleyers’ the entry\r\n‘Ihon Parfre ded wryte thys booke.’ None of these notes seem to be in\r\nthe hand of the text.

There is\r\nnothing to show that Parfre or Blomfield was concerned in the authorship.\r\nThey may have been the copyists.

The play opens with a prologue by the _Poeta_ who speaks\r\nof ‘owr processe.’ In the first scene or ‘station,’ Saul starts for\r\nDamascus and ‘rydyth forth with hys seruantes a-bout the place & owt of\r\nthe place.’ There is a ‘conclusyon’ by the ‘Poeta—si placet,’—\r\n\r\n  ‘ffynally of this stacon we mak a conclusyon,\r\n  besechyng thys audyens to folow and succede\r\n  with all your delygens this generall processyon.’\r\n\r\nAfter a stage-direction ‘ffinis Istius stacionis, et altera sequitur,’\r\nthe _Poeta_ introduces another ‘prosses,’—\r\n\r\n  ‘Here shalbe brefly shewyd with all our besynes\r\n  At thys pagent saynt poullys conuercyon.’\r\n\r\nThis scene takes place outside and in Damascus. There is a tempest,\r\nand ‘godhed spekyth in heuyn.’ Saul meets Ananias, and ‘thys stacion’\r\nis concluded by the _Poeta_, and ‘ffinis istius secunde stacionis et\r\nsequitur tarcia.’\r\n\r\nAgain the _Poeta_ calls on the audience ‘To vnderstond thys pagent at\r\nthys lytyll stacion.’ Saul returns to Jerusalem, preaches and plans to\r\nescape over the wall in a basket. Here the later hand inserted the devil\r\nscene. The _Poeta_ has his ‘Conclusyo,’ which ends:—\r\n\r\n  ‘Thys lytyll pagent thus conclud we\r\n  as we can, lackyng lytturall scyens;\r\n  besechyng yow all of hye and low degre,\r\n  owr sympylnes to hold excusyd, and lycens,\r\n  That of Retoryk haue non intellygens;\r\n  Commyttyng yow all to owr lord Ihesus,\r\n  To whoys lawd ye syng,—Exultet celum laudibus.’\r\n\r\nThe play, but for the devil scene, follows closely the biblical\r\nnarrative. It was probably written for a small village, and for scene had\r\na _platea_, and two _loca_, for Damascus and Jerusalem (with possibly a\r\nthird for heaven). The audience moved with the actors from one ‘station’\r\nor ‘pageant’ to the other, and back again. A later hand has inserted\r\nmarginal directions for a ‘Daunce’ at various points in the speeches of\r\nthe _Poeta_.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _St. Mary Magdalen._\r\n\r\nSchmidt, _Anglia_, viii. 385, assigns this to a West Midland author and\r\nKentish scribe. Furnivall, 53, thinks the dialect East Midland. The plot\r\ncovers the whole legendary life of the Magdalen, as it appears in the\r\n_Golden Legend_. The characters are very numerous, and include Satan and\r\nother devils, with allegorical figures such as the ‘Kyngs of the World\r\nand the Flesch’ and the ‘Seven Dedly Synnes.’ The action is not in any\r\nway divided in the manuscript, and implies an elaborate stationary _mise\r\nen scène_ with various _loca_. These include the ‘castell of Maudleyn’ or\r\nMagdalum, thrones for the _Imperator_, who opens the play by calling for\r\nsilence, Herod and Pilate, ‘a stage, and Helle ondyr-neth that stage’ for\r\n‘the prynse of dylles,’ Jerusalem with a ‘place,’ an ‘erbyr’ or arbour,\r\na tavern, the ‘howse of symont leprovs,’ a _sepulchrum_ for Lazarus,\r\nand another for the _Quem quaeritis_ and _Hortulanus_ scenes which are\r\nintroduced, a palace for the King of ‘Marcylle’ (Marseilles), a heathen\r\ntemple, a ‘hevyne’ able to open, a lodge for the Magdalen in Marcylle,\r\nanother castle, a rock, and a wilderness. There is also a practicable\r\nship which goes to and from Marcylle (l. 1395 ‘Here xall entyre a shyp\r\nwith a mery song’; l. 1445 ‘Her goth the shep owt of the place’; l. 1717\r\n‘Ett tunc navis venit in placeam’; l. 1797 ‘tunc remigat a montem’; l.\r\n1879 ‘et tunc navis venit adcirca plateam’; l. 1915 ‘et tunc remigant a\r\nmonte’; l. 1923 ‘Here goth the shep owȝt ofe the place’). The play ends\r\nwith a _Te Deum_; but the following lines, added after the _Explicit_,\r\nsuggest that the author had readers as well as spectators in mind:—\r\n\r\n  ‘yff Ony thyng Amysse be,\r\n  blame connyng, and nat me:\r\n  I desyer the redars to be my frynd,\r\n  yff ther be ony amysse, that to amend.’\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _Massacre of the Innocents._\r\n\r\nAssigned by Schmidt, _Diss._ 18, to a Midland author and Southern scribe.\r\nAgainst the title of the play has been written, in a hand identified as\r\nthat of the chronicler Stowe, ‘the vij booke.’ Evidently the play was one\r\nof a series, spread over successive years, and given on Saint Anne’s day\r\n(July 26). This is shown by the opening speech of a _Poeta_, from which I\r\nextract:—\r\n\r\n  ‘This solenne fest to be had in remembraunce\r\n  Of blissed seynt Anne moder to our lady,\r\n  ...\r\n  The last yeer we shewid you in this place\r\n  how the shepherdes of Cristes birth made letificacion,\r\n  And thre kynges that came fro ther Cuntrees be grace\r\n  To worshipe Iesu, with enteer deuocion;\r\n  And now we purpose with hooll affeccion\r\n  To procede in oure mater as we can,\r\n  And to shew you of our ladies purificacion\r\n  That she made in the temple, as the vsage was than.\r\n  ...\r\n  ffrendes, this processe we purpose to pley as we can\r\n  before you all, here in your presens,\r\n  To the honour of god, our lady, & seynt Anne,\r\n  besechyng you to geve vs peseable Audiens\r\n  And ye menstrallis, doth your diligens,\r\n  & ye virgynes, shewe summe sport & plesure,\r\n  These people to solas, & to do god reuerens,\r\n  As ye be appoynted; doth your besy cure!\r\n      ¶ Et tripident.’\r\n\r\nThe action includes the Wrath of Herod, with a comic knight, Watkin, the\r\nFlight into Egypt, the Massacre of the Innocents, the Death of Herod, the\r\nPurification. The stage-directions mention a ‘place’ and a ‘tempill.’ In\r\nthe latter are the virgins, who ‘tripident’ with Anne at the end. The\r\n_Poeta_ excuses the ‘rude eloquens’ and ‘sympyll cunnyng’ of his company,\r\npromises ‘the disputacion of the doctours’ for next year, and calls on\r\nthe minstrels and virgins for a final dance.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. _Morality of Wisdom._\r\n\r\nSee _Texts_ (ii), s.v. _Macro Morals_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIAL AND RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscript._\r\n\r\n_Bodleian MS. e Museo_, 160, f. 140. Furnivall, vii. 166, asserts that\r\nthis once formed part of the _Digby MS._ 133, but offers no proof.\r\nThe copy seems to date from the early fifteenth century. After the\r\n_Explicit_, in a later hand, is ‘written by me ...’; unfortunately the\r\nname is torn off.

Schmidt in _Anglia_, viii. 393.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Play._\r\n\r\nSchmidt assigns the play to a writer whose dialect was a mixture of\r\nNorthern and East Midland forms; Morris to a Northern author and West\r\nMidland scribe. Ten Brink, ii. 287, also thinks it to be Northern, and\r\nto date from 1430-60. Apparently the author set out to write, not a\r\ndrama, but a narrative poem, mainly in dialogue. The first fifteen lines\r\nare headed ‘The prologe of this treyte or meditatione off the buryalle\r\nof Criste & mowrnynge therat,’ and contain a request to ‘Rede this\r\ntreyte.’ The first 419 lines have a few narrative phrases introducing\r\nthe speeches, such as ‘Said Maudleyn,’ ‘Said Joseph.’ At this point the\r\nwriter seems to have stopped these, crossed out such as he had already\r\nwritten, and inserted in the margin of his second page,—\r\n\r\n‘This is a play to be playede, on part on gudfriday after-none, & the\r\nother part opon Esterday after the resurrectione, In the morowe, but at\r\nthe begynnynge ar certene lynes [the prologue] which must not be saide if\r\nit be plaiede, which (_... a line cut off_).’\r\n\r\nThe Good Friday scene is an elaborate _planctus_. It is opened by Joseph\r\nof Arimathea, and the three Maries. Then comes Nicodemus, and the body\r\nof Christ is taken from the cross. The Virgin Mary enters with St. John,\r\nand the _planctus_ is resumed. The body is laid in the sepulchre, and the\r\nscene is closed with—\r\n\r\n  ‘Thus her endes the most holy\r\n  Beriall of the body of Crist Iesu.’\r\n\r\nThe Easter morning scene begins with—\r\n\r\n  ‘Her begynnes his resurrection\r\n  On pashe daye at Morn.’\r\n\r\nIt contains a _Quem quaeritis_, a scene of lamentation between Peter,\r\nAndrew, and John, a _Hortulanus_, with a second apparition to all\r\nthree Maries. They sing the first part of the _Victimae paschali_, ‘in\r\ncantifracto vel saltem in pallinodio,’ and the Apostles come in for the\r\ndialogue part. Then the tidings are announced, and Peter and John visit\r\nthe sepulchre; after which, ‘Tunc cantant omnes simul _Scimus Christum_\r\nvell aliam sequentiam aut ympnum de resurrectione.’\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIDENTIFIED PLAYS.\r\n\r\n(i) C.

POPULAR MORALITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIDE OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscript._\r\n\r\nWritten in two hands of the first half of the fifteenth century on\r\nblank spaces of a _Computus_ of Holy Trinity Priory, Dublin, for 1343,\r\npreserved in the Irish Record Office, Dublin (Christ Church collection).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n1891. J. Mills in _Proceedings of Royal Soc. of Antiquaries of Ireland_.\r\n\r\n1898. Brandl, 2.\r\n\r\nCf. H. Morley, _English Writers_, vii. 1730.\r\n\r\nThe play was probably written early in the fifteenth century. The dialect\r\nis that of the South of England, not far from London, modified by\r\nNorthern scribes.\r\n\r\nOnly a fragment (502 ll.) is preserved, but a prologue gives the plot.\r\nThere is no title; but ‘[A mens]ke gam schal gyn & ende’ (l. 7), and ‘[Of\r\nKyng of] lif I wol ȝou telle’ (l. 17). The extant characters are _Rex\r\nVivus_, _Primus Miles Fortitudo_, _Secundus Miles Sanitas_, _Regina_,\r\n_Nuntius Mirth_, _Episcopus_. The King rejoices with Mirth and his\r\nsoldiers, and Queen and Bishop vainly call on him to repent. Later in\r\nthe play Death and Life strove for the King, and Death took him. He was\r\nclaimed by the ‘ffendis,’ but ‘oure lady mylde’ prayed to have him.\r\n\r\nThe play was out of doors (l. 10); the King had a _tentorium_ which could\r\nbe closed (l. 306); the Bishop sat on his ‘se’ (_sedes_); and so probably\r\nwith the other actors, except Mirth, who perhaps came in ‘oure þe lake’\r\n(l. 269); cf. Brandl, xix.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACRO MORALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuscripts._\r\n\r\n(a) _Macro MS._, formerly in the possession of Mr. Cox Macro, now in that\r\nof Mr. Gurney, of Keswick Hall, Norfolk. The MS. appears from a gloss in\r\n_Mankind_ (l. 674; cf. Brandl, xxvi), naming King Edward, to have been\r\nwritten during the reign of Edward IV (1461-1483). At the end of two of\r\nthe plays is the name of Hyngham, a monk, to whom the MS. belonged.\r\n\r\n(b) _Digby MS._ 133, on which cf. p. 428, has on f. 158 the first 754\r\nlines of _Mind, Will, and Understanding_. The handwriting is said to be\r\nthe same as that of the _Macro MS._ (Collier, ii. 207).\r\n\r\n[A complete edition of the three moralities of the _Macro MS._ has long\r\nbeen contemplated by the E. E. T. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _The Castle of Perseverance._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edition._\r\n\r\n1890. Pollard, 64 (408 lines only).\r\n\r\nPollard dates the play not later than the middle of the reign of Henry\r\nVI. It contains about 3,500 lines.\r\n\r\nThe subject is the struggle of good and bad qualities for _Humanum\r\nGenus_. On the one side are _Malus Angelus_ and _Mundus_, _Belial_, and\r\n_Caro_, aided by the Seven Deadly Sins and _Voluptas_, _Stultitia_,\r\n_Detractio_: on the other _Bonus Angelus_, with _Confessio_, _Schrift_,\r\n_Penitencia_, and the Six Divine Graces. Amongst other episodes\r\n_Humanum Genus_ is besieged in the _Castle of Perseverance_. At the end\r\n_Misericordia_, _Iustitia_, _Pax_, _Veritas_, dispute in heaven, and\r\n_Pater sedens in trono_ inclines to mercy.\r\n\r\nThe indications of _mise en scène_ are very valuable. On the first leaf\r\nof the MS. is a diagram of the playing place, reproduced by Sharp, 23.\r\nThere is a large circle with a double circumference, in which is written,\r\n‘This is the watyr a bowte the place, if any dyche may be mad ther it\r\nschal be pleyed; or ellys that it be stronglye barryd al a bowte: & lete\r\nnowth ower many stytelerys be withinne the plase.’ Within the circle\r\nis a rude representation of a castle, and above, ‘This is the castel\r\nof perseveranse that stondyth in the myddys of the place; but lete no\r\nmen sytte ther for lettynge of syt, for ther schal be the best of all.’\r\nBeneath the castle is a small bed, with the legend, ‘Mankynde is bed\r\nschal be under the castel, & ther schal the sowle lye under the bed tyl\r\nhe schal ryse & pleye.’ At the side is a further direction, ‘Coveytyse\r\ncepbord schal be at the ende of the castel, be the beddys feet.’\r\nOutside the circle are written five directions for scaffolds, ‘Sowth,\r\nCaro skaffold—West, Mundus skaffold—Northe, Belial skaffold—North Est,\r\nCoveytyse skaffold—Est, deus skaffold.’ At the foot of the page are some\r\nnotes for costume: ‘& he that schal pley belyal, loke that he have gunne\r\npowder brennyng in pypys in his hands and in his ers, and in his ars\r\nwhanne he gothe to batayle. The iiij dowters schul be clad in mentelys,\r\nMercy in wyth, rythwysnesse in red al togedyr, Trewthe in sad grene, &\r\nPes al in blake, and they schul pleye in the place al to gedyr tyl they\r\nbrynge up the sowle.’\r\n\r\nThere is a prologue by two _vexillatores_, who declare—\r\n\r\n    ‘These percell in propyrtes we spose us to playe,\r\n  This day sevenenyt before you in syth,\r\n    At N on the grene in ryal aray.’\r\n\r\nThey add that they will ‘be onward be underne of the day’ (9 a.m.).\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Mind, Will, and Understanding._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n1835.

These are the three\r\nparts of Anima, who enters with devils running from under her skirts.\r\nEverlasting Wisdom effects a re-conversion. There are a number of mute\r\npersons attendant on the chief characters, whose coming and going,\r\n‘dysgysyde,’ create scenic effects, as in a masque. There are minstrels\r\nand a hornpipe, songs and dances. At one point Lucifer snatches up\r\n‘a shrewde boy’ (perhaps from the audience), and carries him off. An\r\nallusion to the Holborn quest suggests a London origin, but Schmidt\r\n(_Anglia_, viii. 390) thinks the dialect to be that of the north border\r\nof the West Midlands.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Mankind._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n1897.

M. and\r\nHuth Library).\r\n\r\n[1529-1537.] John Skot (in St. Paul’s Churchyard).\r\n\r\nThere are modern editions by Hawkins (1773, vol. i), Gödeke (1865),\r\nHazlitt-Dodsley (1874. vol. i), Pollard (1890, part only, and in full in\r\n_Fifteenth Century Prose and Verse_, 1903), H. Logeman, _Elckerlijk and\r\nEveryman_ (1892), F. Sidgwick (1902). Another is announced in a series\r\nedited by I. Gollancz.\r\n\r\nThere are about 900 lines. Pollard, 202, assigns the text to the end\r\nof the fifteenth century; Ten Brink, ii. 302, to the reign of Edward\r\nIV. Prof. H. Logeman, _Elckerlijk_ (1892), argues the play to be an\r\nEnglish version of the closely similar Dutch _Elckerlijk_, attributed to\r\nPetrus Dorlandus of Diest, but K. H. de Raaf, _Spyeghel der Salicheyt\r\nvan Elckerlijk_ (1897), would invert the relation: cf. Brandl, xiv. The\r\ncharacters are Messenger, God, Death, Everyman, Fellowship, Kindred,\r\nGoods, Good Deeds, Knowledge, Confession, Beauty, Strength, Discretion,\r\nFive Wits, Angel, Doctor. The Messenger prologizes. God sends Death for\r\nEveryman, who finds that no one will accompany him save Good Deeds. The\r\nDoctor epilogizes. There are no indications of the _mise en scène_,\r\nexcept that there was a central scaffold for the ‘House of Salvation’\r\n(Gödeke, 174, 200, cf. Brandl, xx).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD AND THE CHILD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\nAn Oxford bookseller, John Dorne, had a copy of ‘mundus, a play’ in\r\n1520[949].\r\n\r\n1522. Wynkyn de Worde. ‘Here begynneth a propre newe Interlude of the\r\nWorlde and the chylde, otherwyse called (Mundus & Infans)....’\r\n\r\n1523. Wynkyn de Worde.\r\n\r\nThere are a reprint by Lord Althorp (Roxburghe Club, 1817) and modern\r\neditions in Hazlitt-Dodsley, vol. i; Manly, i. 353.\r\n\r\nThe _dramatis personae_ are Mundus or the World, Infans or Dalliance or\r\nWanton or Love-Lust and Liking or Manhood or Shame or Age or Repentance,\r\nConscience, Folly, Perseverance. The representative of Man in various\r\nages is alternately won over to good and evil. There are 979 lines.\r\nCollier, ii. 224; Pollard, li, assign the play to the reign of Henry VII;\r\nBrandl, xlii, thinks that the use of the _Narrenmotif_ points to a date\r\nof composition not long before that of publication. Mundus says, ‘Here I\r\nsette semely in se’ (l. 22), and Manhood ‘Here in this sete sytte I’ (l.\r\n285).\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN SKELTON. (_Magnificence._)\r\n\r\nSkelton was born, probably in Norfolk, about 1460. He studied at\r\nCambridge and acquired fame as a scholar. Both universities honoured him\r\nwith the degree of _poeta laureatus_. He was tutor to Henry VIII as a\r\nboy, and became rector of Diss in Norfolk. But he died in sanctuary at\r\nWestminster (1529), driven there on account of his bitter satires against\r\nWolsey. In his _Garland of Laurell_ (pr. 1523), a late work, he has a\r\nlist of his writings, including—\r\n\r\n  ‘Of Vertu also the souerayne enterlude:\r\n  ...\r\n  His commedy, Achademios callyd by name:\r\n  ...\r\n  And of Soueraynte a noble pamphelet;\r\n    And of Magnyfycence a notable mater.’\r\n\r\nBale, _Scriptores_, i. 652, ascribes to him _Comoediam de uirtute_, Lib.\r\n1; _De magnificentia comoediam_, Lib. 1; _Theatrales ludos_, Lib. 1; _De\r\nbono or dine comoediam_, Lib. 1. _Magnificence_ is, however, his only\r\nextant play.\r\n\r\nWarton (Hazlitt-Warton, iii. 287) describes a piece shown him by William\r\nCollins, the poet, at Chichester, about 1759. He says:—\r\n\r\n‘It is the Nigramansir, a morall _Enterlude_ and a pithie, written by\r\nMaister Skelton laureate, and plaid before the King and other estatys at\r\nWoodstoke on Palme Sunday. It was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in a thin\r\nquarto, in the year 1504. It must have been presented before Henry VII,\r\nat the royal manor or palace at Woodstock in Oxfordshire, now destroyed.\r\nThe characters are a Necromancer or conjurer, the devil, a notary public,\r\nSimony, and Philargyria or Avarice. It is partly a satire on some abuses\r\nin the church.... The story, or plot, is the trial of Simony and Avarice.’\r\n\r\nWarton proceeds to describe the action at some length. Nothing further\r\nis known of the play. Ritson, _Bibliographia Poetica_, 106, said ‘it is\r\nutterly incredible that the _Nigramansir_ ... ever existed,’ and Mr. H.\r\nE. D. Blakiston (_Eng. Hist. Rev._ for April, 1896) has called attention\r\nto several cases in which Warton showed _mala fides_ as a literary\r\nhistorian. In another place (iii. 310) Warton incidentally calls the\r\npiece ‘Skelton’s _The Trial of Simonie_.’ E. G. Duff, _Hand Lists of\r\nEnglish Printers_, Part i, knows of no extant copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Magnificence._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n[1529-1533.] John Rastell. ‘Magnyfycence, a goodly interlude and a mery,\r\ndeuysed and made by mayster Skelton, poet laureate, late deceasyd.’ Folio.\r\n\r\n1533. John Rastell. Quarto.\r\n\r\n1821. J. Littledale (Roxburghe Club).\r\n\r\n1843. A. Dyce, _Poetical Works of Skelton_, i. 225.\r\n\r\n1890. Pollard, 106 (extract).\r\n\r\nThe characters are Felicity, Liberty, Measure, Magnificence, Fancy,\r\nCounterfeit Countenance, Crafty Countenance, Cloked Collusion, Courtly\r\nAbusion, Folly, Adversity, Poverty, Despair, Mischief, Good Hope,\r\nRedress, Sad Circumspection, Perseverance. The plot shows Magnificence\r\nbrought low by evil counsellors, and restored by good ones. The players\r\ncome in and out of ‘the place.’ There are 2,596 lines. The play was\r\nwritten later than 1515, as a reference to the liberality of the dead\r\nLouis of France (l. 283) must intend Louis XII who died in that year, not\r\nthe niggard Louis XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR DAVID LYNDSAY. (_Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis._)\r\n\r\nSir David Lyndsay ‘of the Mount’ in Fifeshire was born in 1490. By 1511\r\nhe was employed in the royal household, first as an actor or musician,\r\nthen as ‘Keeper of the Kingis Grace’s person.’ In 1529 he became Lyon\r\nKing at Arms, a post which included the charge of court entertainments.\r\nHis satire did not spare the church, and he seems to have been in\r\nsympathy with Knox and other reformers, but he did not so far commit\r\nhimself as to endanger his office, which he held until his death in 1555.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Thrie Estaitis._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Performances._\r\n\r\n(i) _Jan. 6, 1540_, _Linlithgow_, before James V. This performance, the\r\nfirst of which there is any satisfactory evidence, was described by Sir\r\nW. Eure in a letter to Cromwell (Ellis, _Original Letters_, 3rd Series,\r\niii. 275; Brewer-Gairdner, xv. 36), enclosing a ‘Copie of the Nootes of\r\nthe Interluyde.’ The version seems to have been different from that now\r\nextant. ‘Solaice’ figured as the presenter. Eure mentions the ‘scaffald’\r\nand ‘the interluyds of the Play.’ He adds that, as a result, James V\r\nadmonished the Bishops to reform their ways.\r\n\r\n(ii) _June 7_ (_Whit-Tuesday_), 1552, _Cupar of Fife_. The Bannatyne\r\nMS. (see below) has the ‘Proclamation maid at Cowpar of Fyffe, upon the\r\nCastell-hill, 7 June, beginning at seven.’ This was therefore the extant\r\nversion. The year is fixed by an incidental reference to the day (June 7)\r\nas Whit-Tuesday.\r\n\r\n(iii) 1554 (?), _Edinburgh_. Henry Charteris, in his preface to Lyndsay’s\r\n_Warkis_ of 1568 (Laing, iii. 231), says of the ‘makar’s’ relations to\r\nthe clergy, ‘Sic ane spring he gaif thame in the Play, playit besyde\r\nEdinburgh, in presence of the Quene Regent, and are greit part of the\r\nNobilitie, with ane exceding greit nowmer of pepill, lestand fra ix\r\nhouris afoir none till vj houris at evin.’ The Bannatyne MS. gives the\r\nplay as ‘maid in the Grenesyd besyd Edinburgh,’ and ‘in anno 155-ȝeiris.’\r\nCf. Appendix W, p. 366.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n(_a_) 1602. Robert Charteris. ‘Ane satyre of the thrie estaits, in\r\ncommendation of vertew in vituperation of vyce. Maid be Sir Dauid\r\nLindesay of the Mont, alias, Lyon King of Armes.’\r\n\r\nDiligence, as presenter, summons the three estates before Rex Humanitas.\r\nMany ‘Vycis’ and other allegorical personages appear before the Rex on\r\nhis ‘royall sait.’ In ll. 1288-1411 comes the first interlude (although\r\nthe term is not used in the text) of ‘The Sowtar and Tailor.’ At l. 1931\r\nis the ‘End of the First Part of the Satyre,’ with the direction, ‘Now\r\nsall the Pepill mak collatioun: then beginnis the Interlude: the Kings,\r\nBischops, and principal Players being out of their seats.’ This interlude\r\nintroduces the Pauper, Pardoner, Sowtar, and others. Part ii begins at\r\nl. 2298. At l. 4283, ‘Heir sall enter Folie,’ and at l. 4483, ‘Heir sall\r\nFolie begin his Sermon, as followis.’ The theme is, of course, _Stultorum\r\nnumerus infinitus_, and at the close the preacher names recipients of\r\nhis ‘Follie Hattis or Hudes’ (cf. ch. xvi). At l. 4629, the people are\r\nfinally dismissed to dance and drink, Diligence calling on a minstrel.\r\n\r\n(_b_) †1568. Bannatyne MS. (ed. Hunterian Club, 1873-1896, Part iv).\r\n\r\nGeorge Bannatyne included in his collection of pieces by the Scots\r\n‘makaris’ (_a_) the ‘Proclamation’ at Cupar of Fife (see above), (_b_) a\r\npreliminary interlude, not in Charteris’s edition, of a Cottar, an Auld\r\nMan and his Wife, a ‘Fuill,’ &c.; (_c_) seven extracts from the play,\r\nheaded, ‘Heir begynnis Schir Dauid Lyndsay Play maid in the Grenesyd\r\nbesyd Edinburgh, quhilk I writtin bot schortly be Interludis, levand\r\nthe grave mater thereof, becaws the samyne abuse is weill reformit in\r\nScotland, praysit be God, quhairthrow I omittit that principall mater and\r\nwrittin only Sertane mirry Interludis thairof verry pleasand, begynnyng\r\nat the first part of the Play.’\r\n\r\n1869.

There is an analysis\r\nof the play in T. F. Henderson, _Scottish Vernacular Literature_, 219.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. TUDOR MAKERS OF INTERLUDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY MEDWALL.\r\n\r\nMedwall was chaplain to John Morton, cardinal and Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury (1486-1500), who is probably the ‘my lord’ of _Nature_, i.\r\n1438. Besides _Nature_, he wrote an interlude ‘of the fyndyng of Troth,\r\nwho was carried away by ygnoraunce and ypocresy,’ played by the King’s\r\nplayers before Henry VIII at Richmond on Jan. 6, 1514. The ‘foolys part’\r\nwas the best, but the play was too long to please the King (cf. p. 201).\r\nSee also s.v. _Lucrece_ (p. 458).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n[1530-4.] William Rastell. ‘A goodly interlude of Nature compyled by\r\nmayster Henry Medwall,’ &c.\r\n\r\n1898. Brandl, 73.\r\n\r\nThere are two ‘partes’ of the ‘processe’ (i. 1434). The first (1439\r\nll.) has Mundus, Worldly Affection, Man, Nature, Innocency, Reason,\r\nSensuality, Privy Council, Pride, a Boy, Shamefastness. In the second\r\n(1421 ll.), on a different day, some of these recur, with Bodily Lust,\r\nWrath, Envy, Sloth, Gluttony, Humility, Charity, Abstinence, Liberality,\r\nChastity, Good Occupation, and Patience. The personages come in and out\r\nat ‘dorys’ (i. 728) and sit down on ‘stole’ or ‘chayr.’ There was also a\r\nfire (ii. 518 sqq.). Probably the scene was in a room. At the end ‘they\r\nsyng some goodly ballet.’\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN HEYWOOD.\r\n\r\nJohn Heywood was born either in London or at North Mimms in\r\nHertfordshire, about 1497. He is claimed as a member of Broadgates\r\nHall, afterwards Pembroke College, Oxford. From about 1515 he was\r\nemployed at Court; in 1519 he is called a ‘singer,’ later a ‘player at\r\nvirginals,’ and finally he was master of a company of children, possibly\r\nthe singing-school of St. Paul’s. His advancement with Henry VIII and the\r\nPrincess Mary is ascribed to Sir Thomas More, whose kinsman he became.\r\nMore’s sister Elizabeth married John Rastell, lawyer and printer. John\r\nHeywood’s wife was their granddaughter, Elizabeth. It may be added\r\nthat their daughter, another Elizabeth, was the mother of John Donne.\r\nHeywood took More’s line in Church matters, but conformed to the Act of\r\nSupremacy. He was in high favour under Mary, and at her death retired to\r\nMalines. He was alive in 1577, but dead in 1587.\r\n\r\nHeywood’s extant interludes are all early work; although Bale, writing\r\nin 1557 (_Scriptores_, ed. 2, ii. 110), only ascribes to him _De Aura,\r\ncomoediam_; _De Amore, tragoediam_; _De quadruplici P._ The _Pardoner and\r\nFriar_, which mentions Leo X as alive, must be before 1521. _Love_ and\r\nthe _Four Ps_ may be about as early: the rest may belong to the following\r\ndecade (Brandl, li). In 1538 Heywood showed a play of children before\r\nMary (Madden, 62). In 1539, Wolsey paid him for a masque of Arthur’s\r\nKnights, or Divine Providence, at court (Brewer, xiv. (2) 782). In 1553\r\nhe set out a play of children at court (_Loseley MSS._ 89). At Mary’s\r\ncoronation he sat in a pageant under a vine against the school in St.\r\nPaul’s Churchyard and made speeches (Holinshed (1808), iv. 6).\r\n\r\nSee W. Swododa, _J.

B._ (article by Mandell Creighton) and\r\n    Cooper, _Athenae Cantabrigienses_; his own works, especially\r\n    _Illustrium Maioris Britanniae Scriptorum Catalogus_ (1548,\r\n    ed. 2, 1557-9, i. 704) and _Vocacyon to Ossory_ (_Harl.\r\n    Miscellany_, ed. 1808, i. 328); editions of plays named below,\r\n    especially that of Schröer.]\r\n\r\nJohn Bale was born in 1495 at Cove, near Dunwich, in Suffolk. He was\r\nplaced as a boy in the Carmelite convent of Norwich, thence went to\r\nthat of Holn, or Holm, in Northumberland, and finally to Jesus College,\r\nCambridge. He took orders, but was converted to Protestantism by Lord\r\nWentworth, and married a ‘faithful Dorothy.’ He became vicar of Thorndon,\r\nin Suffolk, and earned the protection of Thomas Cromwell _ob editas\r\ncomoedias_. Cromwell’s accounts (Brewer, xiv. 2. 337) show payments to\r\nhim for plays on Sept. 8, 1538, at St. Stephen’s, Canterbury, and on\r\nJan. 31, 1539. At his patron’s fall in 1540 he fled to Germany, and\r\njoined vigorously in polemic. In his _Epistel Exhortatorye of an Inglyshe\r\nChristian_ (1544), written under the pseudonym of Henry Stalbridge, he\r\nsays: ‘None leave ye unvexed and untrobled—no, not so much as the poore\r\nminstrels, and players of enterludes, but ye are doing with them. So\r\nlong as they played lyes, and sange baudy songes, blasphemed God, and\r\ncorrupted men’s consciences, ye never blamed them, but were verye well\r\ncontented. But sens they persuaded the people to worship theyr Lorde God\r\naryght, accordyng to hys holie lawes and not yours, and to acknoledge\r\nJesus Chryst for their onely redeemer and saviour, without your lowsie\r\nlegerdemains, ye never were pleased with them.’ He returned in 1547,\r\nand in 1548 printed in his _Scriptores_ the following list of his ‘in\r\nidiomate materno, comedias sub vario metrorum genere.’\r\n\r\n   1. ‘Lib. 14. Vitam D. Ioannis Baptistae.\r\n   2. Com. 1. de Christo duodenni.\r\n   3. Com. 2. de baptismo & tentatione.\r\n   4. Com. 1. de Lazaro resuscitato.\r\n   5. Com. 1. de consilio pontificum.\r\n   6.

Pammachii tragoedias transtuli.’\r\n\r\nAs Bale gives a Latin translation of the opening words of each piece,\r\nhis five extant plays can be identified with those I have italicized. It\r\nis to be noted that Nos. 18 and 19 have the same subject as No. 3, which\r\nseems to form part of a complete Passion cycle (Nos. 2-9).\r\n\r\nIn 1547 Bale was made rector of Bishopstoke, Hants, in 1551 of Swaffham,\r\nNorfolk, and in 1553 Bishop of Ossory, in Ireland. On the day of the\r\nproclamation of Queen Mary he had some of his plays performed at the\r\nmarket-cross of Kilkenny (cf. p. 374). But he had to take refuge at\r\nBasle, and on the accession of Elizabeth found himself too old to resume\r\nhis see, and retired on a prebend in Canterbury Cathedral, where he died\r\nin 1563.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plays._\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _God’s Promises._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n(i) 1577. ‘A Tragedye or enterlude manyfestyng the chefe promyses of\r\nGod vnto man by all ages in the olde lawe, from the fall of Adam to the\r\nincarnacyon of the lorde Jesus Christ.

It is not, like (i), (ii), and (iii), a miracle-play, but\r\na morality, and its Protestantism is far more advanced and polemical\r\nthan theirs. It is 2,081 lines long, and has five _Actus_, with the\r\nusual _Praefatio_ by _Baleus Prolocutor_.

At l. 1119 is a reference to ‘the seconde acte’ and a\r\n‘Finit Actus Primus.’ There are nineteen personages—_Kynge Johan_,\r\n_Ynglond_, _Clargy_, _Sedycyon_, _Cyvyle Order_, _Stevyn Langton_,\r\n_Commynalte_, _Nobylyte_, _Cardynall Pandulphus_, _Pryvat Welth_,\r\n_Dissimulacyon_, _Raymundus_, _Symon of Swynsett_, _Usurpyd Power_, _The\r\nPope_, _Interpretour_ (a presenter), _Treasor_, _Veryte_, _Imperyall\r\nMajestye_—but these are marked with brackets to show that they can be\r\ntaken by nine actors. The play is strongly Protestant. It was doubtless\r\nwritten before 1548, as ‘Lib. 2. de Ioanne Anglorum Rege’ are included\r\nin Bale’s _Scriptores_ list of that year. Collier, i. 123, quotes a\r\ndeposition as to ‘an enterlude concernyng King John’ performed ‘in\r\nChristmas tyme [1538-9] at my Lorde of Canterbury’s’ which was certainly\r\nanti-Papal, and was probably Bale’s. But the extant text has undergone\r\na later revision, for the prayer at the end is for Elizabeth. Fleay,\r\n_Hist. of Stage_, 62, conjectures that it was performed upon her visit to\r\nIpswich in August, 1561. There was probably a single stage or pageant.\r\nThe characters enter and go out. At l. 1377 Sedycyon speaks ‘extra\r\nlocum’; at l. 785 is the phrase ‘Ye may perseyve yt in pagent here this\r\nhower.’\r\n\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS GRIMALD.\r\n\r\nGrimald was the son of a Genoese clerk in the service of Henry VII. He\r\nmigrated from Christ’s College, Cambridge, to Oxford, where, after a\r\nshort stay at Brasenose, he became Fellow and Lecturer first of Merton\r\nin 1540, then of Christ Church in 1547. To this period belong his\r\nLatin plays, and the bulk of his lyrics and other poems in _Tottel’s\r\nMiscellany_. He was widely read in theology and scholarship, and was\r\nchosen chaplain to Bishop Ridley, for whom he did much controversial\r\nwork. Under Mary in 1555 he was imprisoned, but escaped by a recantation.\r\nHe was dead before 1562. Bale, _Scriptores_ (1557), i. 701, ascribes to\r\nhim amongst other writings:—\r\n\r\n  _Archiprophetae tragoediam._\r\n  _Famae comoediam._\r\n  _Christum nascentem._\r\n  _Christum redivivum._\r\n  _Protomartyrem._\r\n  _Athanasium, seu infamiam._\r\n  _Troilum ex Chaucero, comoediam._\r\n\r\nOf these the first and fourth survive; of the others some can only be\r\nconjecturally put down as plays.\r\n\r\n\r\n†1540. _Christus Redivivus._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n1543.

He\r\nwas an early Oxford exponent of Lutheran views. In 1532 he assisted\r\nLeland in preparing verses for the London pageants at the coronation\r\nof Anne Boleyn. From 1533-7 he was vicar of Braintree, Essex, and not\r\nimprobably wrote the play of _Placidas_, alias _Sir Eustace_, recorded\r\nin 1534 in the churchwardens’ accounts. But from 1534 he was also head\r\nmaster of Eton. Thomas Cromwell’s accounts for 1538 include ‘Woodall,\r\nthe schoolmaster of Eton, for playing before my Lord, £5’ (Brewer, xiv.\r\n2. 334). In 1541 he left Eton, under an accusation of theft and other\r\nmisbehaviour. But he found favour with Katharine Parr, Somerset, and\r\nEdward VI through literary and theological work, was made tutor to Edward\r\nCourtenay and obtained in 1551 a prebend at Windsor, and in 1553 the\r\nliving of Calborne, Isle of Wight. He had not, however, so far committed\r\nhimself on the Protestant side as to make it impossible to conform under\r\nMary. He was tutor to Bishop Gardiner’s household, and either in 1553 or\r\n1554 became head master of Westminster. Here he remained to his death in\r\n1556. A letter of Mary in 1554 states that he had ‘at soondrie seasons’\r\nshown ‘dialogues and enterludes’ before her, and requires the Revels\r\noffice to provide him with ‘apparell’ for his ‘devises’ at the coming\r\nChristmas. The Revels accounts for the year mention ‘certen plaies’ made\r\nby him, but the items referring to them cannot be disentangled from those\r\nfor masks given at the same Christmas. Bale does not mention Udall in the\r\n1548 edition of his _Scriptores_, but in that of 1557 he gives a list\r\nof works ‘Latine et Anglice,’ including ‘Comoedias plures, Lib. 1,’ and\r\nadds that he ‘transtulit’ for Katherine Parr, ‘tragoediam de papatu.’\r\nWhen Elizabeth was at Cambridge on Aug. 8, 1564, ‘an English play called\r\nEzekias made by Mr. Udal’ was given before her by King’s College men\r\n(Nichols, _Progr. of Eliz._ i. 186).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roister Doister._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editions._\r\n\r\n[1566-7.

This, however, must be later in date than\r\nthat of the play itself, which has been fixed by Prof. Hales to 1553-4,\r\non the ground that a passage in it is quoted in the third edition\r\n(1553 or 1554) of T. Wilson’s _Rule of Reason_, but not in the earlier\r\neditions of 1550-1 and 1552. Prof. Hales thinks that Udall was master\r\nof Westminster as early as 1553, and wrote it for the boys there. If\r\nWilson’s date is 1554, the play may have been one of those given at court\r\nin the Christmas of 1553.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.

There are about 900\r\nlines. A note says ‘also, yf ye lyst, ye may brynge in a Dysguysinge,’\r\nand a direction for the ‘dance’ or disguising shows that the stage was a\r\n‘hall.’ The date is fixed by Collier, ii. 238; Ward, i. 126; Pollard,\r\n205, on the ground that the discovery of America is said to be ‘within\r\nthis twenty years’ and by ‘Americus’ (i.e. Amerigo Vespucci, 1497). The\r\nauthorship has been doubted, apparently in ignorance of the ascription\r\nof it to Rastell by Bale, _Scriptores_ (1557), i. 660 ‘Insignis his\r\nCosmographus, de trium mundi partium, Asiae, Africae, et Europae\r\ndescriptione, ingeniosissimam ac longissimam comoediam primum edidit,\r\ncum instrumentis & figuris, quam uocabat _Naturam naturatam. Lib. 1.\r\nExuberans diuinae potentiae gratia._’ The opening words quoted by Bale\r\ntranslate those of the play ‘Thaboundant grace of the power devyne.’\r\nProbably Rastell was also the printer, although the unique and imperfect\r\ncopy (_B.M._ 643, b. 45) has only a manuscript imprint.\r\n\r\n5. †1541-8. _John Redford._ _Wit and Science._\r\n\r\nPrinted by Halliwell (Shakespeare Soc., 1848) and Manly, vol. i, from\r\n_Brit.

The final prayer is for the ‘Kyng and Quene.’\r\nBrandl, lxxii, dates the play between 1541, when the ‘gaillard,’ which\r\nis mentioned, was first danced in England, and the death of Katharine\r\nParr in 1548. It was adapted in more than one Elizabethan interlude;\r\ncf. Brandl, loc. cit.; J. Seifert, _Wit- und Science-Moralitäten_\r\n(1892); and p. 200, n. 2.

The Droich (dwarf) enters to an ‘amyable audiens’ in\r\nEdinburgh, ‘to cry a cry.’ He calls himself ‘Welth,’ and bids\r\n\r\n  ‘Ȝe noble merchandis ever ilkane\r\n  Address ȝow furth with bow and flane\r\n            In lusty grene lufraye,\r\n  And follow furth on Robyn Hude.’\r\n\r\nThe piece is clearly a ‘banns’ for a May-game; cf. vol. i. p. 174.

Bolte, in _Vahlen-Festschrift_, 594, says that the\r\npiece is translated from the _Thersites_ of J. Ravisius Textor, printed\r\nin his _Dialogi_ (1651), 239. The first edition of the _Dialogi_ was in\r\n1530 (Bahlmann, _Lat. Dr._ 31).\r\n\r\n18. †1560. _Thomas Ingelend._ _The Disobedient Child._\r\n\r\n[Probably an Elizabethan play, but included here on account of its\r\nrelation to _Thersites_.]\r\n\r\n[1561-75.] Thomas Colwell. A pretie and Mery new Enterlude: called the\r\nDisobedient Child. Compiled by Thomas Ingelend late Student in Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThere are modern editions by Halliwell (Percy Soc. xxiii) and in\r\nHazlitt-Dodsley, vol. ii. The closing prayer is for Elizabeth. Bolte,\r\nloc. cit., considers this a translation of the _Iuvenis, Pater, Uxor_\r\nof Ravisius Textor (_Dialogi_, 71). Brandl, lxxiii, finds in it the\r\ninfluence of the _Studentes_ (1549) of Christopherus Stymmelius\r\n(Bahlmann, _Lat. Dr._ 98).\r\n\r\n\r\nFarces on Classical Models.\r\n\r\n19. †1550-3. _W.

A Ryght Pithy, Pleasaunt and merie Comedie:\r\nIntytuled Gammer gurton’s Nedle: Played on Stage, not longe ago in\r\nChristes Colledge in Cambridge. Made by Mʳ S. Mʳ of Art.\r\n\r\n1661. Thomas Johnson.\r\n\r\nThere are modern editions in Hawkins, vol. i; W. Scott, _Ancient\r\nBritish Drama_ (1810), vol. i; _Old English Drama_ (1830), vol. i;\r\nHazlitt-Dodsley, vol. iii; Manly, vol. ii. The latest is by H. Bradley in\r\nC. M. Gayley, _Representative English Comedies_ (1903).\r\n\r\nThe play is divided into Acts and Scenes, has a prologue and a\r\n_plaudite_; but the subject is not taken from Latin comedy. It is\r\nprobably identical with the _Dyccon of Bedlam_ entered by Colwell on\r\nthe Stationers’ Register in 1562-3, since ‘Diccon, the bedlem’ is a\r\ncharacter. The 1575 edition may, therefore, not have been the first.\r\nJusserand, _Théâtre_, 181, thinks that the satire is even pre-Reformation\r\nin tone. The authorship is much in dispute. I. Reed, _Biographia\r\nDramatica_ (1782), suggested John Still, afterwards bishop of Bath\r\nand Wells, who was a M.A. of Christ’s in 1565. C. H. Ross, in _Modern\r\nLanguage Notes_, vii (1892), no. 6, and _Anglia_, xix. 297, accepts John\r\nBridges, afterwards bishop of Oxford, who is spoken of, but with doubtful\r\nseriousness, as the author, in _Martin Marprelate’s Epistle_ (1588). But\r\nBridges’ initial is not S, nor was he a Christ’s man. H. Bradley, in\r\n_Athenæum_ for August 6, 1898, and J. Peile, _Christ’s College_ (1900),\r\n54, 73, point out that one William Stevenson, a Bachelor Fellow of\r\nChrist’s, is shown by college accounts to have been in charge of plays\r\nthere between 1550 and 1553. His seems to me by far the strongest claim\r\nyet made.\r\n\r\n20. †1553-4. _Nicholas Udall._ _Roister Doister._\r\n\r\nSee s.v. Udall.\r\n\r\n21. †1553-8. _Jack Juggler._\r\n\r\n[1562-9.] W. Copland, A new Enterlude for Chyldren to playe, named Jacke\r\nJugeler, both wytte, and very playsent Newly Imprentid.\r\n\r\nAccording to Grosart, two leaves of another edition are bound with the\r\nDuke of Devonshire’s copy.\r\n\r\nThe play was entered by Copland on the Stationers’ Register in 1562-3.\r\nThere are modern reprints in J. Haslewood, _Two Interludes_ (Roxburghe\r\nClub, 1820); F. J. Child, _Four Old Plays_ (1848); A. B. Grosart, _Fuller\r\nWorthies Library Miscellanies_ (1873), vol. iv; Hazlitt-Dodsley, vol.\r\nii, and a facsimile by E. W. Ashbee (1876). The piece is an imitation of\r\nthe _Amphitruo_ of Plautus. Brandl, lxxi, assigns it to the reign of Mary\r\non the strength of a Catholic sentiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTragedy on Classical Model (?).\r\n\r\n22. †1516-33. _Lucrece._\r\n\r\nA fragment of a ‘Play concerning Lucretia’ is attributed by R. G.\r\nC. Proctor, in _Hand Lists of English Printers_ (1896), Part ii, to\r\nthe press of John Rastell (1516-33). It is in the Bagford collection\r\nof fragments, _Harl. MS._ 5919, f. 20 (no. 98), and consists of two\r\npages, containing a scene in which Publius Cornelius instructs a\r\nconfidential friend with the initial B to sound the feeling of ‘Lucres’\r\ntowards him, and the beginning of a scene between B. and ‘Lucres.’\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps, ii. 340, says that the play was written by\r\nMedwall, †1490, and gives the title as ‘A godely interlude of Fulgeus,\r\nCenatoure of Rome, Lucres his daughter, Gayus Flaminius and Publius\r\nCornelius, of the Disputacyon of Noblenes.’ The ‘Fulgius and Lucrelle’ of\r\nseventeenth-century play-lists (Hazlitt, _Manual_, s.v.; Greg, _Masques_,\r\nlxx) may be related to this. The heroine is not Shakespeare’s Lucrece.\r\n\r\n\r\nLatin Neo-Mysteries.\r\n\r\n23. †1535-45. _Thomas Watson_ (?). _Absolon._\r\n\r\nAscham, _Scholemaster_ (ed. Mayor, 1869), highly praises, together with\r\nBuchanan’s _Jephthes_, the _Absolon_ of Thomas Watson ‘in Sᵗ John’s\r\nCollege Cambridge’ which he never would publish because an anapaest\r\nsometimes stood where he thought, incorrectly, that there should have\r\nbeen an iambus. Watson became bishop of Lincoln. Fleay, _Biog. Chron._\r\nii. 267, and others ascribe the play in error to John Watson, bishop of\r\nWinchester, and speak of a manuscript at Penshurst, which, however, is\r\nnot mentioned in the account of the Penshurst MSS. in _Hist. MSS._ iii.\r\napp. 227. Probably the play is identical with the _Absolon_ preserved in\r\n_Brit. Mus. Stowe MS._ 957, described by G. B. Churchill and W. Keller,\r\n_Die lat. Universitäts-Dramen Englands in der Zeit der Königin Elisabeth_\r\n(_Shakespeare-Jahrbuch_, xxxiv (1898), 229). An eighteenth-century\r\nascription on the first leaf to John Bale is of no authority. The play is\r\nof a Senecan type, with acts and scenes and a chorus. The first line was\r\noriginally ‘Adhuc animus vexatur excusso metu,’ but in the MS., which has\r\nmany corrections, ‘Animus adhuc’ has been substituted.\r\n\r\n24. †1540. _Nicholas Grimald._ _Christus Redivivus._\r\n\r\n25. †1547. _Nicholas Grimald._ _Archipropheta._\r\n\r\nSee s.v.

Oporinus, Basle.\r\n\r\n1590. Nuremberg, Gerlach.\r\n\r\nIn 1672 and 1677 the Latin text was edited by Thomas Comber for school\r\nuse. A French translation by Jacques Bienvenu appeared in 1562. There is\r\nalso\r\n\r\n1579. John and Richard Day. Christ Jesus Triumphant, A fruitefull\r\nTreatise, wherein is described the most glorious Triumph, and Conquest\r\nof Christ Iesus our Saviour.... Made to be read for spiritual comfort by\r\nIohn Foxe, and from Latin translated intoo English by the Printer....\r\n\r\nThere are later editions of 1581 and 1607. This is generally regarded as\r\na translation of the _Christus Triumphans_, but Greg, _Masques_, cxxiii,\r\ndoubts this, and notes that ‘a modern reprint [1828] in the B. M. is\r\nnot dramatic.’ The reprint is in fact a translation of the _De Christo\r\nTriumphante, Eiusdem Autoris Panegyricon_ appended to the Basle edition\r\nof the play. But possibly it does not represent the whole of Day’s work.\r\nThe 1551 edition is given by Bahlmann, _Lat. Dr._ 107. According to S.\r\nL. Lee, in _D. N. B._, it only rests on the authority of Tanner. In 1551\r\nFoxe was tutor to the children of Lord Surrey, who had been executed\r\nsome years before. In 1555 he entered the printing office of Oporinus\r\nat Basle, and in 1564 that of John Day in London. The MS. of the play\r\nis _Lansd. MS._ 1073. It is an ‘Antichrist’ play, written under the\r\ninfluence of the _Pammachius_ (1538) of Thomas Kirchmaier or Naogeorgus\r\n(Bahlmann, _op. cit._ 71). A full analysis is given by Herford, 138.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslation from Latin Neo-Moral.\r\n\r\n27. †1530-40. _J. Palsgrave._ _Acolastus._\r\n\r\n1540. Thomas Berthelet.

Interpreted by John Palsgraue.\r\n\r\nThis is a translation of the _Acolastus_ (1530) of Wilhelm de Volder,\r\nknown in learning as Gnaphaeus or Fullonius, of the Hague (Bahlmann,\r\n_Lat. Dr._ 39). It is arranged for school use, with marginal notes on\r\ngrammar, &c. The original play is the most important of the group dealing\r\nwith the Prodigal Son motive: cf. Herford, 152.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrama of Catholic Controversy.\r\n\r\n28. 1553. _Respublica._\r\n\r\nPrinted by Collier, _Illustrations of Old English Literature_ (1866),\r\nvol. i, and Brandl, 281, from sixteenth-century MS. of Mr. Hudson Gurney\r\nof Keswick Hall, Norfolk, with the heading ‘A merye enterlude entitled\r\nRespublica, made in the yeare of our Lorde, 1553.’\r\n\r\nThe play is divided into Acts and Scenes, and is a ‘Christmas devise’\r\n(prol. 6) by ‘boyes’ (prol. 39). The place-names are of London. The\r\ncontroversial tone is Catholic, and political, rather than theological.\r\nBrandl, lviii, finds the model in Lyndsay’s _Satyre_. Except for the\r\nPrologue (the Poet) all the characters are abstractions. Avarice, _alias_\r\nPolicy, is ‘the vice of the plaie.’\r\n\r\n\r\nDramas of Protestant Controversy.\r\n\r\n29. 1538. _John Bale._ _God’s Promises._\r\n\r\n30. 1538. _John Bale._ _John Baptist._\r\n\r\n31. 1538. _John Bale._ _The Temptation._\r\n\r\n32. 1538. _John Bale._ _The Three Laws._\r\n\r\n33. ?1539, 1561. _John Bale._ _King John._\r\n\r\nSee s.v.

Vele.\r\n\r\nCopyright was entered on the Stationers’ Register by John King in 1560-1.\r\nThere are modern reprints in Hawkins, vol. i, and Hazlitt-Dodsley, vol.\r\nii. The characters are abstractions with the Devil, a Messenger, and\r\nLittle Bess a ‘Curtisane.’ The prayer is for a king and his council who\r\nrule, which points to the reign of Edward VI.\r\n\r\n35. †1547-53. _T. R._ _Nice Wanton._\r\n\r\n1560. John King. A Preaty Interlude called, Nice wanton.—At end of play,\r\n‘Finis T. R.’\r\n\r\nThere are reprints in Hazlitt-Dodsley, vol. i, and Manly, vol. i. The\r\ncharacters are curiously heterogeneous: Messenger, Barnabas, Ismael,\r\nDalila, Eulalia, Iniquitie, Baily Errand, Xantippe, Worldly Shame,\r\nDaniel. Brandl, lxxii, considers the play an adaptation of the _Rebelles_\r\n(1535) of George Van Langeveldt or Macropedius, of Utrecht (Bahlmann,\r\n_Lat. Dr._ 55). The rhyme ‘queenes’—‘things’ in the final prayer shows an\r\noriginal date of composition under Edward VI.\r\n\r\n36. †1547-53. _Somebody, Avarice and Minister._\r\n\r\nFragment of unidentified edition amongst papers of the reign of Edward\r\nVI in Lambeth Library, reprinted by S.

The original is the _Tragedia\r\ndel Libero Arbitrio_ (1546) of Francesco Nigri de Bassano. The translator\r\ncannot be, as stated in the _D. N. B._, Henry, the son of Sir John Cheke,\r\nif the date of his birth is as there given (†1548).\r\n\r\n\r\nProtestant Controversy: Pseudo-Interludes.\r\n\r\n38. †1547-53. _Robin Conscience._\r\n\r\nOften described as an ‘interlude,’ but really a series of dialogues\r\nbetween Robin Conscience, his father Covetousness, his mother New-guise,\r\nand his sister Proud-beauty. Collier, ii. 315, describes it from a\r\nprinted fragment in the Devonshire library, and inclines to ascribe it to\r\nthe reign of Edward VI; cf. Herford, 55. Hazlitt, iii. 225, prints the\r\nfull text from a later edition.\r\n\r\n39. 1549. _Ponet._ _Bishop of Rome._\r\n\r\nA tragoedie or Dialoge of the uniuste usurped primacie of the Bishop of\r\nRome. A translation by John Ponet, Bishop of Winchester, from the Italian\r\nof Bernardino Ochino (1549); cf. Bale, i. 694; Herford, 33. Among the\r\nspeakers are Edward VI and Somerset.\r\n\r\n\r\nLost Interludes.\r\n\r\nSee s.v. Skelton for the alleged _Nigramansir_ (1504).\r\n\r\nS. Jones, _Biographia Dramatica_ (1812), ii. 328, describes ‘A newe\r\nInterlude of Impacyente Poverte, newlye Imprinted. M. V. L. X.’ The\r\ncopyright of this play, which is in the Sir Thomas More list (cf. p. 200)\r\nand that in _Captain Cox_, cxviii, was transferred on the Stationers’\r\nRegister from the late Sampson Awdeley to John Charlwood on Jan. 15, 1582.\r\n\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps, _Dictionary of Old English Plays_ (1860), quoting\r\n‘Coxeter’s Notes,’ is the authority for ‘An Interlude of Welth and Helth,\r\nfull of Sport and mery Pastyme,’ n.d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On these tendencies generally, see Davidson, 130; Ward, i. 32;\r\nR. Rosières, _Société française au Moyen Âge_, ii. 228; E. King,\r\n_Dramatic Art and Church Liturgy_ (_Dublin Review_, cxxv. 43). Mediaeval\r\nliturgiologists such as Belethus, Durandus, and Honorius of Autun\r\n(P.L. clxxii), lay great stress on the symbolical aspect of ritual and\r\nceremonial. J. M. Robertson, _The Gospel Mystery-Play_ (_The Reformer_,\r\nN.S. iii (1901), 657), makes an ingenious attempt to show that the\r\nearlier gospel narratives of the Passion, those of Saints Matthew and\r\nMark, are based upon a dramatic version. This, he thinks, to have been\r\non classical lines, and to have been performed liturgically until about\r\nthe second century, when it was dropped in deference to the ascetic views\r\nof the stage then prevalent (cf. vol. i. p. 11). But the narrative, with\r\nits short speeches, its crowd of characters and its sufferings ‘coram\r\npopulo’ cannot, on the face of it, be derived from a _classical_ drama.\r\nA nearer parallel would be the Graeco-Jewish Ἐξαγωγή of Ezechiel (first\r\ncentury B.C., cf. Ward, i. 3). The Gospel narrative is, no doubt, mainly\r\n‘a presentation of dramatic action and dialogue’; but this may be because\r\nit was built up around _Logia_. Of external evidence for Mr. Robertson’s\r\nview there is none. The ritual of the first two centuries was probably a\r\nvery simple one; cf. F. E. Warren, _Liturgy of the Ante-Nicene Church_,\r\n54. The earliest liturgical dramas, even in the Greek churches, and\r\nthose only guessed at, are of the fourth (cf. p. 206). Mr. Robertson\r\nclaims support from _Galatians_, iii. 1 οἷς κατ’ ὀφθαλμοὺς Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς\r\nπροεγράφη ἐσταυρωμένος. Lightfoot, however, declares that the meaning of\r\nπρογράφειν is ‘write up in public,’ ‘placard,’ ‘proclaim.’ If it cannot,\r\nas he says, mean ‘paint,’ still less can it mean ‘represent dramatically.’\r\n\r\n[2] Duchesne, 47: A.

The custom is described in the\r\n_Peregrinatio Silviae_ (Duchesne, 486) as already in use at Jerusalem in\r\nthe fourth century. ‘Etiam cum coeperit esse hora undecima, legitur ille\r\nlocus de evangelio, ubi infantes cum ramis vel palmis occurrerunt Domino,\r\ndicentes: _Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini_. Et statim levat se\r\nepiscopus et omnis populus porro: inde de summo monte Oliveti totum\r\npedibus itur.

The _Sarum Processional_, 50 (from eds.\r\n1508, 1517), has ‘finito evangelio, unus puer ad modum prophetae indutus,\r\nstans in aliquo eminenti loco, cantat lectionem propheticam modo quo\r\nsequitur.’ Then come alternating passages between the ‘propheta’ and\r\n‘tres clerici.’ Perhaps the latter were also sometimes disguised, but the\r\n_Sarum Processional_, as well as the thirteenth-century _Consuetudinary_\r\nand the _York Missal_ (_MS. D_), all specify that the clergy, other\r\nthan the prophet, shall be ‘habitu non mutato.’ Several of the London\r\nrecords given by Mr. Feasey mention an ‘angel,’ and one of them a ‘chylde\r\nthat playde a messenger.’ A Coutances Order of 1573 (Gasté, 74) forbids\r\n‘spectacula ... cum habitibus inhonestis’ at the Gospel during Mass on\r\nPalm Sunday.\r\n\r\n[7] Martene, iii. 72; Gasté, 72; R.

The _York Missal_, i. 102, says, for Good\r\nFriday, ‘Diaconus legat Passionem,’ but _MS. D._ adds ‘vel legatur a\r\ntribus Presbyteris, si sic ordinatum erit.’ Payments for the singers\r\nof the Passion are quoted from churchwardens’ accounts (1447-1562) by\r\nFeasey, 81. The singing was sometimes done from the rood loft.\r\n\r\n[9] Feasey, 17; _Use of Sarum_, i. 140 ‘quarta autem feria ante pascha\r\ndum passio domini legitur ad prolacionem ipsius clausulae _Velum templi\r\nscissum est_: praedictum velum in area presbiterii decidat.’ The same\r\nrubric is in the Wells _Ordinale_ (H.

Script._ i. 235) ‘Iubilus, id est neuma ... si autem tristitiae\r\nfuerit oratio, ululatus dicitur, si vero gaudii, iubilus.’\r\n\r\n[18] Gautier, _Les Tropes_, passim; _Winchester Troper_, vi; Dankó,\r\n_Vetus Hymnarium Eccles. Hungariae_, 15; Julleville, _Myst._ i. 21;\r\nCreizenach, i. 47. Gautier, i, defines a trope, ‘Qu’est-ce qu’un Trope?\r\nC’est l’interpolation d’un texte liturgique,’ and M. Gerbert, _de cantu\r\net musica sacra_ (1774), i. 340 ‘Tropus, in re liturgica, est versiculus\r\nquidam aut etiam plures ante inter vel post alios ecclesiasticos cantus\r\nappositi.’ Of earlier writers, cf. Durandus, iv. 5 ‘Est autem proprie\r\ntropus quidam versiculus qui in praecipuis festivitatibus cantatur\r\nimmediate ante introitum quasi quoddam praeambulum et continuatio ipsius\r\nintroitus.’ Gautier, 111, describes a large number of Tropers; Frere,\r\n_Winchester Troper_, xxvii, xxx, those of English uses from Winchester,\r\nCanterbury, Worcester, St. Albans, Dublin; Pamelius, _Liturgicon_ (1609),\r\nii. 611 an English Troper in the library of St. Bavon’s, Ghent. Amongst\r\ntropes in the wider sense are included the _farsurae_ (vol. i. p. 277).\r\nMany of the later tropes are trivial, indecent, or profane. They are\r\ndoubtless the work of _goliardi_ (vol. i. p. 60).\r\n\r\n[19] _St. Gall MS._ 484, f. 13 (ninth century); cf. Gautier, 34, 62, 139,\r\n218; _Winchester Troper_, xvi; Meyer, 34. It is also in the Winchester\r\nTropers (tenth-eleventh century), and the Canterbury Troper (fourth\r\ncentury), and is printed therefrom in _Winchester Troper_, 4, 102. Here\r\nit is divided between two groups of _Cantores_, and has the heading\r\n‘Versus ante officium canendi in die Natalis Domini.’\r\n\r\n[20] The _Introit_ is: ‘Puer natus est nobis, et filius datus est nobis:\r\ncuius imperium super humerum eius, et vocabitur nomen eius magni consilii\r\nangelus. _Ps._ Cantate domino canticum novum.’\r\n\r\n[21] Gautier, 219, prints a dialogued trope for a feast of St. Peter from\r\nan eleventh-century troper of St. Martial of Limoges; the _Winchester\r\nTroper_, 6, 103, has one for St. Stephen’s day (Winchester) and one for\r\nSt. John the Evangelist’s (Canterbury). Meyer, 35, calls attention to the\r\ndialogued Christmas _versus sacerdotales_ in Hartker’s tenth-century St.\r\nGall _Antiphonarium_ (J. M. Thomasius, _Opera_, iv. 187).\r\n\r\n[22] _St. Gall MS._ 484, f. 11; printed and facsimiled by Gautier, 216,\r\n220.\r\n\r\n[23] _S. Matthew_ xxviii. 1-7; _S. Mark_ xvi. 1-7.\r\n\r\n[24] The _Introit_ is: ‘Resurrexi et adhuc tecum sum, alleluia: posuisti\r\nsuper me manum tuam, alleluia; mirabilis facta est scientia tua,\r\nalleluia, alleluia. _Ps._ Domine, probasti me.’\r\n\r\n[25] Lange, 22, from _Bibl. Nat. Lat. MS._ 1240, f. 30ᵇ. As to date\r\n(923-34) and _provenance_ of the MS., I follow H. M. Bannister in\r\n_Journal of Theological Studies_ (April, 1901). Lange, 4, considers it an\r\neleventh-century _Antiphonar_ from Beaune.\r\n\r\n[26] Printed by Frere, 176; cf. Gautier, 219. The version in Lange, 20,\r\nis incomplete. The Limoges Tropers (_Bibl. Nat._ 887, 909, 1084, 1118,\r\n1119, 1120, 1121), all of the eleventh century, are described by Gautier,\r\n111; cf. p. 29.\r\n\r\n[27] _Bibl. Nat._ 1118, f. 40ᵛ; cf. Gautier, 226; Frere, 176.\r\n\r\n[28] _Bodl. Douce MS._ 222, f. 6 (eleventh century; cf. Gautier, 136),\r\nprinted and facsimiled by Gautier, 215, 219. Du Méril, _Or. Lat._ 149,\r\ngives it from a Limoges Troper (_B.N._ 909, f. 9): it is also in _B.N._\r\n1118, f. 8ᵛᵒ, and probably the other Limoges MSS. Frere, 145, gives it\r\nfrom the twelfth-century St. Magloire Troper (_B.N._ 13,252), and R.\r\nTwigge, in _Dublin Review_ (1897), 362, from a fifteenth-century breviary\r\nof Clermont-Ferrand (_Cl. F. MS._ 67). Here it is sung by two boys, and\r\nnear the altar after the Te Deum at Matins. According to Gautier, 123, it\r\nis also in the late eleventh-century Nevers Troper (_B.N._ 9449).\r\n\r\n[29] Frere, 110, from _Cott. MS. Calig._ A. xiv (eleventh century).\r\nIt comes between an illumination of the Ascension and the heading ‘In\r\nDie Ascensionis Domini.’ It is also in the St. Magloire Troper (_B.N._\r\n13,252, f. 10ᵛ) under the heading ‘In Ascensione Tropi ad Processionem,’\r\nand in the St. Martial of Limoges Tropers (Gautier, 219; Lange, 20).\r\nMartene, iii. 193, describes it as sung in the procession before Mass at\r\nVienne.\r\n\r\n[30] Martene, iv. 147 ‘“Post processionem,” _addunt Dionysianae consuet._\r\n[thirteenth century], “ascendant iuxta Sancta Sanctorum quidam bene\r\ncantantes, alii in dextro latere, alii in sinistro latere assistentes,\r\nbene et honorifice tropas scilicet: _Quem quaeritis_; coniubilantes, et\r\nsibi invicem respondentes; et cum intonuerint, _Quia surrexi_, dicens,\r\n_Patri_, mox Archicantor et duo socii eius assistentes in choro regias\r\nvirgas in manibus tenentes, incipiant officium.” Hunc ritum accepisse\r\nvidentur a Cassinensibus, quorum Ordinarium [before 1105] haec habet:\r\n“Processione finita, vadat Sacerdos post altare, et versus ad chorum\r\ndicat alta voce, _Quem quaeritis?_ et duo alii Clerici stantes in medio\r\nchori respondeant: _Iesum Nazarenum_; et Sacerdos: _Non est hic_; illi\r\nvero conversi ad chorum dicant: _Alleluia_. Post haec alii quatuor\r\ncantent tropos, et agatur missa ordine suo.”’ As usual in _Ordinaria_\r\n(cf. e.g. p. 309) only the opening words of the chants are given. A\r\nsimilar direction is contained in _MS. Casinense_, 199, a twelfth-century\r\nbreviary (_Bibliotheca Casinensis_, iv. 124): cf. also Lange, 21, 23.\r\n\r\n[31] Martene, iii. 173; Lange, 24 (Tours i).\r\n\r\n[32] Lange, 26. Cf. the account of the Vienne _Quem quaeritis_ (p. 26).\r\n\r\n[33] Martene, iv. 148.\r\n\r\n[34] Mr. Frere does not print any _Introit_ tropes from the Worcester,\r\nSt. Albans, and Dublin tropers: a leaf is unfortunately missing from the\r\nCanterbury troper (Frere, 107) where the _Quem quaeritis_ might have\r\ncome. It is not amongst the few tropes taken by Pamelius, _Liturgicon_\r\n(1609), ii. 611, from the English troper at St. Bavon’s, Ghent (Frere,\r\n142). As the _Concordia Regularis_ was partly based on Ghent customs (cf.\r\np. 307), I should gladly know more of this.\r\n\r\n[35] _Bodl. MS._ 775; described by Frere, xxvii, as _MS. E_ ‘Its date\r\nlies between 979 and 1016, since Ethelred is mentioned as reigning\r\nsovereign in the Litany on f. 18ᵛ, and in consequence it has sometimes\r\nbeen called “The Ethelred Troper.” Also, as it has the Dedication\r\nFestival on the 24th of November, it is probably anterior to the\r\nre-dedication of the Cathedral on Oct. 20, 980, since this day became\r\nsubsequently the Dedication Festival.’ A facsimile from the MS. was\r\npublished by the _Palaeographical Society_ (Series ii. pl. iii), and it\r\nwas suggested that it is in an early eleventh-century hand, but possibly\r\ncopied an earlier text. But surely it would have been brought up to date\r\non such a matter as the Dedication Festival.\r\n\r\n[36] _C.C.C. Cambridge MS._ 473, of the middle of the eleventh century,\r\ndescribed by Frere, xxvii, as _MS. CC._ The text of the _Quem quaeritis_\r\ndiffers slightly from that of the _Bodl. MS._ and does not appear to be\r\nquite complete. It is facsimiled by Frere (pl. 26ᵃ). The printed text in\r\nFrere, 17, represents both versions; that in Manly, i. xxi, follows the\r\n_Bodl. MS._ Both Frere and Manly have ‘Angelice uocis consolatio’ where\r\nthe _Bodl. MS._, as I read it, has ‘Angelice uoces consolatus’ (clearly\r\nin error).\r\n\r\n[37] A full account of the _Concordia Regularis_ and extracts from the\r\nLatin text are in Appendix O.\r\n\r\n[38] I cannot understand why Mr. Frere, xvi, thinks that the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_ was ‘a dramatic dialogue which came to be used as a trope\r\nto the _Introit_ of Easter: but at Winchester it kept its independent\r\nplace.’ It is used as a trope a century before the date of the _Concordia\r\nRegularis_.\r\n\r\n[39] Why is the _Quem quaeritis_ in the _Bodl. MS._ apparently on Good\r\nFriday? Perhaps this was an irregular use reformed by Bp. Ethelwold. If\r\nso the _C. R._ must be about 980 or later. This is not impossible (cf.\r\nApp. O). In the later _C. C. C. C. MS._ the _Q. q._ might, I think, from\r\nits position be intended for Easter Matins. The version described in the\r\n_C. R._ differs slightly from that of the tropers.\r\n\r\n[40] Martene, iv. 299 ‘Saeculo, ut aiunt, x scriptae’: cf. Douhet, 849.\r\nMartene, iii. 173, cites another Matins version from a vetustissimum\r\nrituale’ of Poitiers. If this is identical with the ‘pontificale\r\nvetustissimum: annorum circiter 800’ mentioned in his list of authorities\r\n(i. xxii) it may be earlier than the tenth century. It is certainly not\r\nthe ‘liber sacramentorum annorum 900 circiter’ with which Douhet, 848,\r\nwould identify it. The Pontificale was used by Martene in his edition of\r\n1738; about the first edition of 1700-6, I cannot say. This version is\r\nnot in Lange, and, as the omission of the usual first line is curious, I\r\nprint it below (p. 29).\r\n\r\n[41] Lange, 29; cf. Creizenach, i. 49.\r\n\r\n[42] The Verdun _Consuetudines_ do not. The burial and resurrection of\r\nthe cross clearly formed no part of the Good Friday and Easter rites.\r\nThe dialogue takes place ‘in subterraneis specubus,’ i.e. the crypt,\r\nand the representatives of the Maries return to the choir ‘cruce vacua\r\nnuntiantes: _Surrexit Dominus_’ (Martene, iv. 299).\r\n\r\n[43] Appendix O.\r\n\r\n[44] Bare feet continued to be the rule for the _Adoratio Crucis_. An\r\nexception is at Exeter, where, according to Pearson, ii. 296, they were\r\nforbidden, cf. Feasey, 115.\r\n\r\n[45] St. Ethelwold’s Latin is atrocious, but I think that the sepulchre\r\nwas made on the altar, not in the hollow of it, and covered from sight\r\nuntil wanted by a veil let down all round it from a circular support\r\nabove. Cf. the Latin text in Appendix O: perhaps it is corrupt.\r\n\r\n[46] _Peregrinatio Silviae_ in Duchesne, 490. The object of adoration was\r\na fragment of the true Cross, ‘sanctum lignum crucis.’ The Invention of\r\nthe Cross by St. Helena is put by tradition †326. Doubtless many other\r\nchurches obtained a fragment, and used it for the same purpose: cf.\r\nFeasey, 116. Thus the cross used at Rome was ‘lignum pretiosae crucis’\r\n(Duchesne, 465: cf. his ed. of the _Liber Pontificalis_, i. 374).\r\n\r\n[47] Duchesne, 238. For the mediaeval ceremony, cf. Feasey, 114; Pearson,\r\nii. 293; Milchsack, 121; Rock, iii. 2. 241; Martene, iii. 129; iv. 137;\r\n_Sarum Missal_, 328; _York Missal_, i. 105; _York Manual_, 156, and the\r\nDurham extract in Appendix P: for that of modern Rome, Malleson and\r\nTuker, ii. 271.\r\n\r\n[48] The _sepulchrum_ is not in the _Sacramentarium Gelasianum_ (†seventh\r\ncentury, ed. H. A. Wilson, 77); nor the _Sacramentum Gregorianum_\r\n(†eighth century, _P. L._ lxxviii. 86), ‘qua salutata et reposita in\r\nloco suo’; nor in the Roman _Ordines_ collected by Mabillon (_P. L._\r\nlxxviii) nor in those added by Duchesne, 451, 464. The _Ordines_ of 954\r\nand 963 repeat the Gregorian formula, which is expanded by those of\r\n1215 and 1319 into ‘in suo loco super altare.’ There is no mention of\r\nthe _sepulchrum_ in the Gallican liturgical books collected by Mabillon\r\n(_P. L._ lxxii). Of English books Leofric’s _Exeter Missal_ (tenth\r\ncentury, ed. F. E. Warren) has no _Sepulchrum_; nor the _Missal_ of St.\r\nAugustine’s Canterbury (†1100, ed. M. Rule), ‘reposita in loco solito’;\r\nnor the _Missal_ of Robert of Jumièges (ninth and tenth century, ed. H.\r\nA. Wilson for _H. B. Soc._). Pearson, ii. 316, suggests that the cross\r\nused for adoration was the great rood usually placed in the rood-loft,\r\nbut sometimes ‘super altare.’\r\n\r\n[49] Ethelwold’s _Concordia Regularis_ was largely founded on that of\r\nBenedict of Aniane (†817; cf. Miss Bateson in _E. H. Review_, ix. 700),\r\nbut there is no Easter week _ordo_ in this (_P. L._ ciii. 701) nor in\r\nthe same writer’s _Memoriale_ or _Ordo Monasticus_ (_P. L._ lxvi. 937:\r\ncf. his _Vita_, c. viii, in _Acta SS._ Feb. ii. 618). Ethelwold also\r\nborrowed customs from Fleury and Ghent (Appendix O). The _sepulchrum_ is\r\nnot mentioned in the _Consuetudines Floriacenses_ (tenth century, ed.\r\nDe Bosco, _Floriac. Vet. Bibl._ (1605), 390); cf. Creizenach, i. 49:\r\nnor in the description of a thirteenth-century _coutumier_ in Rocher,\r\n_Hist. de l’Abbaye de St.-Benoît-sur-Loire_, 323. The only Fleury _Quem\r\nquaeritis_ is of a late type in a thirteenth-century MS.; cf. p. 32.\r\nAt Ghent, however, an inventory of treasures remaining at St. Bavon’s\r\nafter a Norman invasion (1019-24) includes ‘tabulas de sepulchro 23,’\r\nwhich appear to be distinct from _reliquiae_ ‘de sepulchro Domini’ and\r\n‘de operculo ligneo quod super corpus ipsius positum fuit in sepulchro’\r\n(_Neues Archiv_, viii. 374). Did the possession of these ‘reliquiae’\r\nsuggest to the monks of St. Bavon’s the construction of an Easter\r\nsepulchre?\r\n\r\n[50] It is merely a guess to say St. Gall. Schübiger, _Sängerschule St.\r\nGallens_, 69, mentions the sepulchre there, but gives no very early\r\nnotice. The sepulchre was known in the Eastern, as well as the Western\r\nChurch, and for all I know may have come from Jerusalem (Feasey, 177). As\r\nto date, Weber, 32, suggests that pictorial representations of the Maries\r\nat the tomb show the influence of the dramatic _Visitatio Sepulchri_ as\r\nfar back as the ninth century. His chief point is that the Maries carry\r\n_turribula_ (cf. p. 25, n. 5).\r\n\r\n[51] _E. H. Review_, ix. 706.\r\n\r\n[52] _P. L._ cl. 465 ‘adorata ab omnibus cruce, portitores eius elevantes\r\neam incipiant antiphonam _Super omnia ligna cedrorum_, et sic vadant ad\r\nlocum ubi eam collocare debent.’ This does not exclude a sepulchre, but\r\nprobably the _locus_ was an altar which might serve as a _statio_ for the\r\nprocessions ‘ad crucifixum’ ordered on Easter Saturday after vespers and\r\nthrice a day through Easter week. Such processions continued in later\r\nritual to visit the cross after its _Elevatio_ on Easter morning: cf.\r\n_York Manual_, 177.\r\n\r\n[53] See the description of the ceremony by a sixteenth-century\r\neye-witness in Appendix P. The _sepulchrum_ was also used by the\r\nBridgettines of Sion monastery, an order of reformed Benedictine nuns (G.\r\nF. Aungier, _Hist. of Syon Monastery_, 350).\r\n\r\n[54] J. D. Chambers citing J.

Dankó, _Vetus Hymn. Eccl. Hungariae_,\r\n535, 579. I have not seen this writer’s _Die Feier des Osterfestes_\r\n(Wien, 1872). On representations of the sepulchre in mediaeval art, cf.\r\nP. Weber, 32, and the miniature from Robert of Jumièges’ _Missal_ (ed. F.\r\nE. Warren for _H. B. Soc._ pl. viii).\r\n\r\n[61] At Exeter on the other hand Vespers on both Good Friday and Easter\r\nEve were sung before the Sepulchre; and so with the Hours at Tours\r\n(Feasey, 130).\r\n\r\n[62] Martene, iii. 179; Milchsack, 122; Lange, 135. The latter gives\r\na Passau fifteenth-century version which ends ‘quibus finitis stantes\r\nante altare, mutua caritate se invicem deosculentur, dicentes: _Surrexit\r\ndominus vere. Et apparuit symoni._ Dicatur una oratio de resurrectione.\r\nStatim fiat pulsatio.’ The Easter greeting and kiss of peace were in use,\r\neither before or after Matins at many churches (Martene, iii. 171, 180)\r\nand do not depend upon the sepulchre.\r\n\r\n[63] Milchsack, 128, 135; cf. Meyer, 64. The _Ordo Augustensis_ of 1487\r\ndirects that a procession shall go from the sepulchre ‘per ambitum\r\nvel cimeterium ... usque ad ultimam ianuam, quae claudatur.’ Here\r\nthe _Tollite portas_ dialogue is held with the ‘levita iunior, vel\r\nalius in figura diaboli grossa voce.’ On the other hand, in the _Ordo\r\nWirceburgensis_ of 1564 the procession knocks at the door from inside,\r\nand the respondent ‘loco Sathanae’ is without.\r\n\r\n[64] ‘Sacerdos ... antequam congregetur chorus, cum processione sibi\r\npaucorum adiunctorum ... foribus ecclesiae clausis, secretius tollat\r\nsacramentum de sepulchro’; cf. the fifteenth-century Passau _Breviary_\r\n(Lange, 135) ‘clam surgitur’ and the _Ordo Sepulturae_ in the _Missalis\r\nPosoniensis_ of 1341 (Dankó, 579) ‘laicis exclusis.’ I have not noticed\r\nany such limitation in English rubrics later than the _Concordia\r\nRegularis_.\r\n\r\n[65] Milchsack, 119 ‘quum a nostris antecessoribus ad nos pervenerit,\r\nut in sacra nocte dominicae resurrectionis ad sustollendam crucifixi\r\nimaginem de sepulchro, ubi in parasceve locata fuerat, nimia virorum et\r\nmulierum numerositas, certatim sese comprimendo, ecclesiam simul cum\r\ncanonicis et vicariis introire nitantur, opinantes erronee, quod si\r\nviderent crucifixi imaginem sustolli, evaderent hoc anno inevitabilem\r\nmortis horam. His itaque obviantes statuimus, ut resurrectionis mysterium\r\nante ingressum plebis in ecclesiam peragatur’: cf. Pearson, ii. 298.\r\n\r\n[66] A Finchale inventory of 1481 (J. T. Fowler, _Trans. of Durham\r\nand North. Arch. Soc._ iv. 134) includes ‘Item 1 pixis argentea cum\r\ncoopertorio et ymagine crucifixi in summitate coopertorii pro corpore\r\nxⁱ deferendo in passione xⁱ.’ A pyx was also used in the Sarum rite\r\n(Appendix Q).\r\n\r\n[67] Feasey, 165; Dankó, _Vet. Hymn. Eccl. Hung._ 535.\r\n\r\n[68] _York Manual_, 174 ‘cuppa in qua est sacramentum.’\r\n\r\n[69] At Durham (Appendix P) and at Lincoln (Wordsworth, 278); cf. Feasey,\r\n164; Heales, 307. The image ‘cum corona spinea’ used at York (_York\r\nManual_, 170) was of course the crucifix. A Reformation record of 1566 at\r\nBelton, Lincolnshire, speaks of ‘a sepulker with little Jack broken in\r\npieces’ (Feasey, 165). Either a mere image or a mechanical puppet (cf. p.\r\n158) may be meant. The _labarum_ is the sign of the risen Christ in the\r\nlater versions of the _Quem quaeritis_; cf. p. 35. It figures in nearly\r\nall paintings of the Resurrection.\r\n\r\n[70] Narbonne _Ordinarium_ (†1400) ‘levent cum filo pannum, qui est super\r\nlibros argenti super altare in figura sepulcri’ (Martene, iii. 172;\r\nLange, 65); Le Mans, _Ordinarium_ ‘Tunc tres clerici accedentes ad altare\r\ncum reverentia sublevent palium cum quo sepulchrum fuerit coopertum’\r\n(Lange, 66); cf. Pearson, ii. 293.\r\n\r\n[71] Feasey, 131. In versions of the _Quem quaeritis_ given by Lange,\r\n24, 25, 26, the action is at the altar. A Senlis _Breviary_ (fourteenth\r\ncentury) has ‘elevantes palium altaris’ (Lange, 27), and a Sens\r\nthirteenth-century MS. ‘Sublevans tapetum altaris, tamquam respiciens\r\nin sepulchrum’ (Lange, 64). But I am not sure that there was a genuine\r\nsepulchre in all these cases: cf. p. 26.\r\n\r\n[72] Würzburg _Breviary_ (fourteenth century) ‘descendunt in criptam ad\r\nvisitandum sepulcrum’ (Lange, 53): cf. the Verdun _Consuetudines_ (p.\r\n16), where there may or may not have been a regular sepulchre.\r\n\r\n[73] I have seen a beautiful one at Tarrant Hinton, Dorset, which is not\r\namongst those mentioned by Heales or Feasey.\r\n\r\n[74] The performers are sometimes directed to enter the sepulchre; cf.\r\ne.g. Lange, 28.\r\n\r\n[75] Feasey, 149. There is such a chapel beneath the choir of the\r\n_Jérusalem_ church at Bruges. The Winchester sepulchre is a chapel, but\r\nnot of the Jerusalem type. At St. Gall the sepulchre was (†1583) in the\r\n‘sacellum S. Sebastiani’ (Lange, 69).\r\n\r\n[76] J. Britton, _Redcliffe Church_, 47, prints a contemporary\r\ndescription of a sepulchre given in 1470 by ‘Maister Canynge’ to St.\r\nMary Redcliffe, Bristol, with, amongst other adornments, ‘Heaven made\r\nof timber and stain’d clothes’ and ‘Hell, made of timber and iron-work\r\nthereto, with Divels to the number of 13.’ This is apparently not\r\na Chatterton forgery. Feasey, 166, gives a somewhat similar London\r\nspecification, and also (p. 145) describes a fourteenth-century wooden\r\nsepulchre from Kilsby, Northants, believed to be the only one in\r\nexistence. I have a suspicion that the wooden so-called ‘watcher’s\r\nchamber’ to the shrine of St. Frideswide in Christ Church, Oxford, is\r\nreally a sepulchre. It is in the right place, off the north choir aisle,\r\nand why should a watcher of the shrine want to be perched up in a wooden\r\ncage on the top of a tomb?\r\n\r\n[77] Dankó, 536, 580. Two instances are given. In one the sepulchre was\r\nsealed, in the other the pyx, ‘sigillo vel clavi ecclesiae.’ At Hereford\r\n‘episcopus ... cereo claudat sepulchrum’ (Feasey, 159, from _Harl. MS._\r\n2983).\r\n\r\n[78] Cf. vol. i. p. 126.\r\n\r\n[79] Wordsworth, 279; Feasey, 161; Heales, 272, 299.\r\n\r\n[80] Milchsack, 127.\r\n\r\n[81] G. Gilpin, _The Bee-Hive of the Romish Church_ (1579) (translated\r\nfrom Isaac Rabbotenu of Louvain, 1569) ‘They make the graue in a hie\r\nplace in the church, where men must goe up manie steppes, which are\r\ndecked with blacke cloth from aboue to beneath, and upon everie steppe\r\nstandeth a siluer candlesticke with a waxe candle burning in it, and\r\nthere doe walke souldiours in harnesse, as bright as Saint George, which\r\nkeep the graue, till the Priests come and take him up; and then commeth\r\nsodenlie a flash of fire, wherwith they are all afraid and fall downe;\r\nand then up startes the man, and they begin to sing Alleluia, on all\r\nhandes, and the clocke striketh eleuen.’ Feasey, 168, quotes De Moleon\r\nfor a statement that the watchers at Orleans were dressed as soldiers.\r\n\r\n[82] Appendix Q.\r\n\r\n[83] Hooper, _Early Writings_ (Parker Soc.), 45 ‘The ploughman, be he\r\nnever so unlearned, shall better be instructed of Christ’s death and\r\npassion by the corn that he soweth in the field, and likewise of Christ’s\r\nresurrection, than by all the dead posts that hang in the church, or are\r\npulled out of the sepulchre with _Christus resurgens_. What resemblance\r\nhath the taking of the cross out of the sepulchre and going a procession\r\nwith it, with the resurrection of Christ? None at all: the dead post is\r\nas dead when they sing _Iam non moritur_, as it was when they buried it\r\nwith _In pace factus est locus eius_’: cf. Ridley, _Works_ (Parker Soc.),\r\n67.\r\n\r\n[84] _Articles devised by the King’s Majesty_, 1536 (Burnet, i. 1. 435;\r\ni. 2. 472; cf. Froude, ii. 486); Strype, _Eccles.

There certainly were\r\nsepulchres in 1548 (Feasey, 175).\r\n\r\n[86] Dixon, iii. 37; Wilkins, iv. 32. The _Act of 2 and 3 Edward VI_,\r\nc. 10 (Froude, iv. 495), against images and paintings, was probably\r\nalso held to require the demolition of many sepulchres: cf. Ridley’s\r\n_Visitation Articles_ of 1550, quoted by Heales, 304.\r\n\r\n[87] Dixon, iv. 129.\r\n\r\n[88] Dixon, iv. 157; S. R. Maitland, _Essays on the Reformation_ (ed.\r\n1899), 186.\r\n\r\n[89] Hardy and Gee, _op. cit._ 428. Art. xxiii forbids ‘monuments of\r\n... idolatry and superstition.’ The Elizabethan _Visitation Articles_\r\ncollected in the _Second Report_ of the _Ritual Commission_ make no\r\nmention of sepulchres. They generally follow pretty closely the wording\r\nof the _Injunctions_. But the _Articles_ of Bentham, Bishop of Lichfield\r\nand Coventry (1565), specify ‘monuments of idolatry and superstition’\r\nas including ‘Sepulchres which were used on Good Friday’ (Heales, 307).\r\nNotices of the destruction of sepulchres become numerous, being found,\r\nfor instance, in the case of 50 out of 153 Lincolnshire churches (Feasey,\r\n142), and pious legacies begin to direct tombs ‘whereas the sepulchre was\r\nwonte to stande.’\r\n\r\n[90] Davidson, 140; Malleson and Tuker, ii. 263, 267, 272. The latest\r\nexamples of the _Quem quaeritis_ are of the eighteenth century from\r\nCologne and Angers (Lange, 36, 39) and Venice (_Z. f. d. A._ xli. 77).\r\n\r\n[91] This respond begins _Dum transisset Sabbatum_.\r\n\r\n[92] Cf. p. 18, n. 2. The Sarum _Custumary_ provides for censing on\r\nfeasts (_a_) at the anthem ‘super Magnificat’ at Vespers, (_b_) during\r\nor after the _Te Deum_ at Matins (_Use of Sarum_, i. 113, 121). The\r\nsepulchre is included only at Vespers (cf. Appendix Q), but the variation\r\nI suggest would not be great.\r\n\r\n[93] Cf. p. 22, n. 1. The Bamberg _Agenda_ of †1597 (Lange, 93) has\r\nan _Ordo visitandi sepulchrum_ which opens with directions for the\r\nconstruction of a sepulchre, which would obviously not be the case if the\r\n_Depositio_ and _Elevatio_ had preceded. Lange rarely prints more than\r\nthe _Visitatio_, but of one group of texts he notes (p. 135) that the\r\nMSS. generally have also the _Elevatio_.\r\n\r\n[94] Lange’s collection from 224 MSS. supersedes those of Du Méril,\r\nCoussemaker, Milchsack, &c. He supplemented it by versions from Meissen,\r\nWorms, Venice, and Grau in Hungary in _Z. f. d. A._ (1896), xli. 77;\r\nand has not got those from the (_a_) Winchester _Tropers_ (cf. p. 12);\r\n(_b_) Autun and Nevers _Tropers_ of the eleventh century (Gautier,\r\n126, 219); (_c_) St. Magloire, twelfth-century _Troper_ (cf. p. 11);\r\n(_d_) Dublin _Processionals_ (Appendix R); (_e_) Laon twelfth-century\r\n_Ordinary_ (Chevalier, _Ordinaires de Laon_, 118); (_f_) Clermont-Ferrand\r\nfifteenth-century _Breviary_ (cf. p. 11); (_g_) Poitiers _Ritual_\r\n(Martene, iii. 173); (_h_) Verdun tenth-century _Consuetudinary_\r\n(Martene, iv. 299; cf. p. 15). The MSS. extend from the tenth to the\r\neighteenth century. The majority of them are Breviaries; some are\r\nOrdinaries, Antiphoners, Processionals; a few are late Tropers, in which,\r\nbesides the Tropes proper, the Holy week _Ordo_ is included (cf. Gautier,\r\n81); two (_B. N. Lat._ 1139 from Limoges, and _Orleans MS._ 178, from\r\nFleury) are special books of dramatic _repraesentationes_; cf. p. 1.\r\n\r\n[95] Martene, iii. 180, from an undated _Caeremoniale_. Lange, 26, only\r\ngives a portion of the text containing the _Quem quaeritis_ proper, which\r\nwas sung as a processional trope before the _Missa maior_. The procession\r\nhad immediately before gone to the sepulchre and sung other anthems. But\r\nthe sepulchre played a part at two other services. Before Matins the\r\nclergy had in turn entered the sepulchre, found it empty, came out and\r\ngiven each other the kiss of peace and Easter greeting. No _Elevatio_ is\r\ndescribed; perhaps it was still earlier ‘clam.’ After Lauds, the _Missa\r\nmatutinalis_ was sung ‘ad sepulchrum’ and the _prosa_ or Alleluia trope\r\nwas thus performed: ‘Prosa _Victimae Paschali_. Finito v _Dicat nobis\r\nMaria_, clericulus stans in sepulcro cum amictu parato et stola, dicat ℣.\r\n_Angelicos testes_. Chorus respondeat _Dic nobis Maria_. Clericulus dicat\r\n_Angelicos testes_. Clericus dicat _Surrexit Christus_. Chorus _Credendum\r\nest magis_ usque ad finem.’ On this prose and its relation to the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_ cf. p. 29. At St. Mark’s, Venice (_Z. f. d. A._ xli. 77), the\r\nposition of the _Quem quaeritis_ is also abnormal, coming just before\r\nPrime, but this version dates from 1736.\r\n\r\n[96] Cf. p. 12.\r\n\r\n[97] Lange, 28 (Parma), 30 (Laon), 47 (Constance), 68 (Rheinau), 69 (St.\r\nGall). At Rheinau, the _Elevatio_ takes place in the course of the _Quem\r\nquaeritis_: at Parma, and probably in the other cases, the ‘sacrista\r\npervigil’ has already removed the ‘Corpus Christi.’\r\n\r\n[98] Durandus, lib. vi. c. 87. He describes the normal _Visitatio_, in\r\nterms much resembling those of Belethus (cf. p. 31), and adds ‘quidam\r\nvero hanc presentationem faciunt, antequam matutinum inchoent, sed hic\r\nest proprior locus, eo quod _Te deum laudamus_ exprimit horam, qua\r\nresurrexit. Quidam etiam eam faciunt ad missam, cum dicuntur sequentia\r\nilla _Victimae paschali_, cum dicitur versus _Dic nobis_ et sequentes.’\r\nIoannes Abrincensis, _de Offic. eccles._ (_P. L._ cxlvii. 54), briefly\r\nnotes the ‘officium sepulchri’ as ‘post tertium responsorium,’ and says\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n[99] Strassburg _Agenda_ of 1513 (Lange, 50) ‘Haec prescripta visitatio\r\nsepulcri observetur secundum consuetudinem cuiuslibet ecclesiae.’ Meyer,\r\n33, quotes a passage even more to the point from the Bamberg _Agenda_ of\r\n1587 ‘Haec dominicae resurrectionis commemoratio celebrioribus servit\r\necclesiis, unde aliarum ecclesiarum utpote minorum et ruralium rectores\r\net parochi ex ordine hic descripto aliquid saltem desumere possunt,\r\nquod pro loci et personarum illic convenientium qualitate commodum fore\r\niudicaverint.’\r\n\r\n[100] Laon _Ordinarium_ of twelfth century (U. Chevalier, _Ordinaires\r\nde Laon_, 118). The change consisted mainly in the introduction of the\r\n_Victimae paschali_: cf. p. 29.\r\n\r\n[101] Cf. the full discussion, mainly from the textual point of view,\r\nthroughout Lange’s book, with that of Meyer, and Creizenach, i. 47;\r\nFroning, 3; Wirth, 1.\r\n\r\n[102] The Bohemian fourteenth-century version (Lange, 130) is nearly all\r\nnarrative sung by the Ebdomarius: the only dialogue is from the _Victimae\r\npaschali_. Martene, iii. 173, gives, from a ‘vetustissimum Rituale,’\r\nthis Poitiers version, not in Lange, ‘Finitis matutinis, accedunt ad\r\nsepulchrum, portantes luminaria. Tunc incipit Maria: _Ubi est Christus\r\nmeus?_ Respondet angelus _Non est hic_. Tunc Maria aperit os sepulchri,\r\net dicit publica voce: _Surrexit Christus_. Et omnes respondent _Deo\r\ngratias_.’ Possibly Maria here is the Virgin, who is not usually included\r\nin the _Visitatio_. But the same anthem opens a twelfth-century Limoges\r\nversion, headed ‘Oc est de mulieribus’ in _B. N. Lat. MS._ 1139, a\r\ncollection of ritual plays. The full text is ‘Ubi est Christus meus\r\ndominus et filius excelsus?’ which is not really appropriate to any other\r\nspeaker: cf. Milchsack, 38. A frequent variant on ‘Quem quaeritis in\r\nsepulchro, o Christicolae?’ is ‘Quem quaeritis, o tremulae mulieres, in\r\nhoc tumulo plorantes?’; nor can the two forms be localized (Lange, 84).\r\n\r\n[103] Lange, 32. These MSS. are of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\r\nI find no such section in the normal text of the Gregorian _Liber\r\nresponsalis_, which is the antiphonary for the office (_P. L._ lxxviii.\r\n769). The ‘antiphonae de resurrectione domini ubicumque volueris’ of\r\nthe _B. N. Lat. MS._ 17,436 include the ‘Cito euntes dicite, &c.,’\r\n‘Currebant duo simul, &c.,’ ‘Ardens est cor meum, &c.,’ and others which\r\nare regularly introduced into the play. Another commonly used is the\r\n_Christus resurgens_ with its verse, ‘Dicant nunc Iudaei, &c.,’ which the\r\nSarum books assign to the _Elevatio_ (Appendix Q): cf. Lange, 77.\r\n\r\n[104] Text in Daniel, _Thesaurus Hymnologicus_, ii. 95; Kehrein,\r\n_Lateinische Sequenzen des Mittelalters_, 81, and with facsimile and\r\nsetting in A. Schübiger, _Die Sängerschule St. Gallens_, 90, &c.;\r\ncf. Lange, 59; Meyer, 49, 76; Milchsack, 34; Chevalier, _Repertorium\r\nHymnologicum_, s.vv.; A. Schübiger, _La Séquence de Pâques Victimae\r\nPaschali et son auteur_ (1858).\r\n\r\n[105] Malleson-Tuker, ii. 27. It is used throughout Easter week.\r\n\r\n[106] Lange, 60. It was interpolated during the thirteenth century in a\r\ntwelfth-century Laon version (Chevalier, _Ordinaires de Laon_, 118).\r\n\r\n[107] Narbonne, †1400 (Lange, 65) ‘duo canonici, tanquam apostoli’; cf.\r\nLange, 75.\r\n\r\n[108] Augsburg _liber liturgicus_ of eleventh or twelfth century (Lange,\r\n82).\r\n\r\n[109] Belethus, c. cxiii (_P. L._ ccii. 119) ‘fit enim in plerisque\r\nEcclesiis ut cantato ultimo responso, cum candelis cereis et solemni\r\nprocessione eant ex choro ad locum quemdam, ubi imaginarium sepulcrum\r\ncompositum est, in quod introducuntur aliquot in personis mulierum et\r\ndiscipulorum Ioannis et Petri, quorum alter altero citius revertitur,\r\nsicut Ioannes velocius cucurrit Petro, atque item alii quidam in personis\r\nangelorum qui Christum resurrexisse dixerunt a mortuis. Quo quidem\r\nfacto personae eae redeunt ad chorum, referuntque ea quae viderint et\r\naudierint. Tunc chorus, audita Christi resurrectione, prorumpit in altam\r\nvocem, inquiens, _Te Deum laudamus_.’ It is to be observed that Belethus\r\nknows no _Depositio_ and _Elevatio_. After the _Adoratio_, he has, like\r\nthe older Roman liturgies, ‘crucifixus in suum locum reponi debet’\r\n(c. xcviii). Durandus, vi. 87, has an account very similar to that of\r\nBelethus, but says ‘Si qui autem habent versus de hac representatione\r\ncompositos, licet non authenticos non improbamus’; cf. also p. 27.\r\n\r\n[110] Engelberg (1372), Cividale (fourteenth century), Nuremberg\r\n(thirteenth century), Einsiedeln (thirteenth century), Prague (six,\r\ntwelfth to fourteenth centuries), Rouen (two, thirteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies), Mont St.-Michel (fourteenth century), Coutances (fifteenth\r\ncentury), Fleury (_Orleans MS._ 178, thirteenth century); all printed\r\nby Lange, 136 sqq. Gasté, 58, 63, also gives the Rouen and Coutances\r\nversions, the latter more fully than Lange. Meyer, 80, discusses the\r\ninterrelations of the texts.\r\n\r\n[111] Lange, 138. In this text the Maries have a _locus suus_. The MS.\r\nis a _Processional_, and it may be that the play was given not in the\r\nchurch, but in the open square, as was the Annunciation play in the\r\nsame MS. (Coussemaker, 284; cf. p. 67). It is none the less liturgical.\r\nRouen had probably an ‘ortus Christi’ out of which came the apparition\r\n‘in sinistro cornu altaris,’ for at Easter, 1570, divine service was\r\nperformed in a ‘paradis dressé avec la plus grande solennité dans la\r\nchapelle Notre-Dame, derrière le chœur’ (Gasté, 58).\r\n\r\n[112] These are of course the ‘versus’ spoken of with tolerance in the\r\npassage just quoted from Durandus.\r\n\r\n[113] Appendix R. The _Heu! pius pastor occiditur_ does not seem to have\r\nbeen found outside the Fleury and Dublin plays (Chevalier, _Repert.\r\nHymn._ nᵒ. 7741).\r\n\r\n[114] Lange, 136, 141; Milchsack, 35, 66.\r\n\r\n[115] Lange, 64, 74.\r\n\r\n[116] Ibid. 162.\r\n\r\n[117] Ibid. 151. The fourteenth-century text runs:\r\n\r\n  _Tres Mariae_:\r\n\r\n    ‘aromata preciosa querimus,\r\n    Christi corpus ungere volumus,\r\n    holocausta sunt odorifera\r\n    sepulturae Christi memori.’\r\n\r\n  _Ungentarius_:\r\n\r\n    ‘dabo vobis ungenta optima,\r\n    salvatoris ungere vulnera,\r\n    sepulturae eius ad memoriam\r\n    et nomen eius ad gloriam.’\r\n\r\nThe earlier texts have ‘aromata ... memori,’ preceded by ‘Mariae\r\ncantantes “aromata” procedant ad unguentarium pro accipiendis ungentis’\r\nand followed by ‘quibus acceptis accedant ad sepulchrum.’ Meyer, 58,\r\n91, 106, calls this scene, in which he finds the first introduction of\r\nnon-liturgical verse, the _Zehnsilberspiel_, and studies it at great\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[118] Lange, 24, 51, 64 ‘coopertis capitibus’ (Tours, fifteenth century),\r\n‘capita humeralibus velata’ (Rheinau), ‘amictibus in capitibus eorum’\r\n(Narbonne, †1400).\r\n\r\n[119] Lange, 36 (fourteenth century).\r\n\r\n[120] Ibid. 27, 36, 53, 64, &c.; Appendix R.\r\n\r\n[121] Lange, 51, 160; cf. _Conc. Regularis_ (Appendix O).\r\n\r\n[122] Lange, 64 ‘induti albis et amictibus cum stolis violatis et sindone\r\nrubea in facie eorum et alis in humeris’ (Narbonne, †1400).\r\n\r\n[123] Lange, 40, 155, 158, 162 ‘palmam manu tenens, in capite fanulum\r\nlargum habens’ (Toul, thirteenth century), ‘tenens spicam in manu’\r\n(Rouen, fifteenth century), ‘tenens palmam in manu et habens coronam in\r\ncapite’ (Mont St.-Michel, fourteenth century), ‘vestitus alba deaurata,\r\nmitra tectus caput etsi deinfulatus, palmam in sinistra, ramum candelarum\r\nplenum tenens in manu dextra’ (Fleury, thirteenth century).\r\n\r\n[124] Appendix R.\r\n\r\n[125] Lange, 147.\r\n\r\n[126] Ibid. 143 ‘quae sit vestita dalmatica casulamque complicatam super\r\nhumeros habeat; coronamque capiti superimpositam, nudis pedibus.’\r\n\r\n[127] Lange, 156 ‘albatus cum stola, tenens crucem.’\r\n\r\n[128] Ibid. 159, 164 ‘in habitu ortolani ... redeat, indutus capa\r\nserica vel pallio serico, tenens crucem’ (Coutances); ‘praeparatus\r\nin similitudinem hortolani ... is, qui ante fuit hortulanus, in\r\nsimilitudinem domini veniat, dalmaticatus candida dalmatica, candida\r\ninfula infulatus, phylacteria pretiosa in capite, crucem cum labaro\r\nin dextra, textum auro paratorium in sinistra habens’ (Fleury). The\r\n_labarum_ is the banner of Constantine with the Chi-Ro monogram (cf.\r\nGibbon-Bury, ii. 567): but the banner usually attached to the cross in\r\nmediaeval pictures of the Resurrection itself bears simply a large cross;\r\ncf. Pearson, ii. 310.\r\n\r\n[129] A study of the music might perhaps throw light on the relation\r\nof the versions to each other. I am sorry that it is beyond my powers:\r\nmoreover Lange does not give the notation; Coussemaker gives it for half\r\na dozen versions.\r\n\r\n[130] For such overtures cf. Lange, 36, 62, 64; Milchsack, 37, 38, 40. On\r\nthe doubtful use of the _Gloriosi et famosi_ at Einsiedeln, cf. p. 54.\r\n\r\n[131] In the Prague versions (Lange, 151). The choir, or rather\r\n‘conventus,’ introduces the scenes with the three following anthems:\r\n(i) ‘Maria Magdalena et alia Maria ferebant diluculo aromata, dominum\r\nquerentes in monumento,’ (ii) ‘Maria stabat ad monumentum foris plorans;\r\ndum ergo fleret, inclinavit se et prospexit in monumentum,’ (iii)\r\n‘Currebant duo simul et ille alius discipulus praecucurrit citius petro\r\net venit prior ad monumentum.’\r\n\r\n[132] Lange, 146 (Nuremberg); for later examples cf. Lange, 99 sqq. The\r\nhymn generally comes just before the _Te Deum_. A fourteenth-century\r\nBohemian version from Prague (Lange, 131) has a similar Bohemian hymn\r\n‘Buoh wssemohuczy.’ At Bamberg in 1597 ‘potest chorus populo iterum\r\npraecinere cantilenas pascales Germanicas’ (Lange, 95). At Rheinau\r\nin 1573 it is suggested that the _Quem quaeritis_ itself may as an\r\nalternative be sung in German (Lange, 68) ‘hisce aut Germanicis versibus\r\ncantatis.’ At Aquileja in 1495 ‘Populus cantet _Christus surrexit_,’\r\napparently in Latin (Lange, 106); and at Würzburg in 1477, ‘Populus\r\nincipit Ymnum suum: _Te Deum_’ (Lange, 67).\r\n\r\n[133] Lange, 39, 119, 122, 124; cf.

Creizenach, i. 88; Julleville,\r\ni. 62; Meyer, 95; and on the MS. which also contains the ‘Ordo\r\nrepresentacionis Adae,’ and is not native to Tours, cf. p. 71.\r\n\r\n[149] Milchsack, 105; Creizenach, i. 90. The beginning and end of the\r\nKlosterneuburg play were printed from a thirteenth-century MS., now\r\nlost, by B. Pez, _Thesaurus novus Anecd._ ii. 1. liii. It began ‘Primo\r\nproducatur Pilatus cum responsorio: _Ingressus Pilatus_,’ and ended with\r\n‘Christ, der ist erstanden’; cf. Meyer, 126.\r\n\r\n[150] ‘Modo veniat angelus et iniciat eis fulgura; milites cadunt in\r\nterram velut mortui.’\r\n\r\n[151] Meyer, 97, 125, with text and facsimile, ‘Incipit ludus immo\r\nexemplum Dominice resurrectionis.’ The episode of the Resurrection\r\nwith the dismay of the soldiers is found not only in the Tours and\r\nBenedictbeuern MS., but also in the simpler Coutances _Quem quaeritis_.\r\nLange, 157, omits this passage, but Gasté, 63, gives it; ‘Si Mariae\r\ndebeant representari, finito responsorio quatuor clerici armati\r\naccedentes ad sepulcrum Domini pannis sericis decenter ornatum et secum\r\ndicant personagia sua. Quo facto, duo pueri induti roquetis veniant\r\nad monumentum ferentes duas virgas decorticatas in quibus sunt decem\r\ncandelae ardentes; et statim cum appropinquaverint ad sepulcrum praedicti\r\nmilites, procidant quasi mortui, nec surgant donec incipiatur _Te Deum_,\r\n... &c.’ There is no actual appearance of the Rising Christ in any of\r\nthese three plays as originally written. But a later hand has inserted\r\nin the Benedictbeuern MS. directions for the Christ to appear, discourse\r\nwith the angels, and put on the ‘vestem ortulani.’\r\n\r\n[152] Creizenach thinks the play (like Adam) was outside the church,\r\nbecause the Maries appear ‘ante ostium ecclesiae.’ But ‘ante’ may be\r\ninside. Mary Magdalen at one point is ‘in sinistra parte ecclesiae\r\nstans,’ and most of the action is round the _sepulchrum_.\r\n\r\n[153] E. Wechssler, _Die romanischen Marienklagen_ (1893); A. Schönbach,\r\n_Die Marienklagen_ (1873); cf. Creizenach, i. 241; Julleville, i. 58;\r\nSepet, 23; Milchsack, 92; Coussemaker, 285, 346; Meyer, 67; Pearson, ii.\r\n384.\r\n\r\n[154] A _planctus_ ascribed to Bonaventura (thirteenth century) has\r\nthe titles ‘Officium de compassione Mariae’ (Wechssler, 14), and\r\n‘Officium sanctae crucis’ (_Bibl. de l’École des Chartes_, xxxiv. 315).\r\nAnother, the ‘Surgit Christus cum trophaeo,’ is headed in thirteenth-\r\nand fourteenth-century MSS. ‘Sequentia devota antiquorum nostrorum\r\nde resurrectionis argumentis. Sanctarum virginum Mariae ac Mariae\r\nMagdalene de compassione mortis Christi per modum dyalogi sequentia.’\r\nThe chorus begins, and ‘tres bene vociferati scholares respondent’\r\n(text in Milchsack, 92; cf. Wechssler, 14). A third, ‘O fratres et\r\nsorores,’ is headed ‘Hic incipit planctus Mariae et aliorum in die\r\nParasceves’ (text from fourteenth-century Cividale MS. in Coussemaker,\r\n285; Julleville, i. 58; cf. Wechssler, 17). Ducange, s.v. _Planctus_,\r\nquotes a (thirteenth-century) Toulouse rubric, ‘planctum beatissimae\r\nVirginis Mariae, qui dicitur a duobus puerulis post Matutinum et debent\r\nesse monachi, si possunt reperiri ad hoc apti.’ This _planctus_ was sung\r\nfrom the ‘cathedra praedicatorii.’ On the use of vernacular Italian\r\n_planctus_ by the _laudesi_ in churches through Lent, cf. Wechssler,\r\n30. The vernacular German ‘ludus passionis’ printed by O. Schönemann,\r\n_Der Sündenfall und Marienklage_ (1855), 129, from a Wolfenbüttel\r\nfifteenth-century MS., seems to have still been meant for liturgical use,\r\nas it has the rubric ‘debet cantari post _crux fidelis_ et sic finiri\r\nusque ad vesperam lamentabiliter cum caeteris sicut consuetum est fieri.’\r\nIt incorporates the _Depositio_.\r\n\r\n[155] Meyer, _Fragmenta Burana_, 64, 122, with text and facsimile. The\r\npiece ends ‘et ita inchoatur ludus de resurrectione. Pontifices: _O\r\ndomine recte meminimus_,’ which is the opening of the Easter play already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[156] Printed by Du Méril, 147; Gasté, 25; Davidson, 173, from Rouen\r\n_Ordinaria_ (_Rouen MSS._ Y. 108 of fifteenth century, Y. 110 of\r\nfourteenth century); Coussemaker, 235, with notation, from Rouen\r\n_Gradual_ (_Bibl.

The play occurs, with\r\nan _Officium Stellae_, in an anonymous treatise _De ratione divini\r\nofficii_. The Amiens _Ordinarium_ of 1291 (Grenier, 389) gives directions\r\nfor a _Pastores_ during the procession after the communion at the\r\nmidnight mass. In preparation lights were lit at the _praesepe_ during\r\nfirst vespers ‘dum canitur versus _praesepe iam fulget tuum_.’ At the end\r\nof the first nocturn the figure of a child was placed there. At the first\r\nlesson of the second nocturn the cry of _noël_ was raised.\r\n\r\n[168] Du Méril, 148.\r\n\r\n[169] Ioannes Abrincensis, _De officiis ecclesiasticis_ (_P. L._ cxlvii.\r\n41, 43). Neither Belethus nor Durandus mentions the _Pastores_.\r\n\r\n[170] Cf. vol. i. p. 272. The _praesepe_ is of course in the _Stella_,\r\nwhich is found at Strassburg, Bilsen, and Einsiedeln, but even this is\r\nmore characteristic of France than of Germany.\r\n\r\n[171] Text ed. C. Magnin (_Journal des Savants_ (1846), 93), from _Bibl.\r\nNat. Lat._ 1139.\r\n\r\n[172] Gasté, 50 ‘Corona ante crucem pendens in modum stellae accendatur’\r\n(Rouen); Du Méril, 153 ‘stellam pendentem in filo, quae antecedit eos’\r\n(Limoges). The churchwardens’ accounts of St. Nicholas, Yarmouth, from\r\n1462-1512 (_Norfolk Archaeology_, xi. 334), contain payments for ‘making\r\na new star,’ ‘leading the star,’ ‘a new balk line to the star and ryving\r\nthe same star.’ Pearson, ii. 325, lays stress on the prominence of the\r\nstar in the German vernacular mysteries. J. T. Micklethwaite, _Ornaments\r\nof the Rubric_, 44, says that the ‘star’ was called a ‘trendle’ or\r\n‘rowell.’ Its use does not necessarily imply the presence of a drama.\r\n\r\n[173] The account of the _Stella_ here given should be supplemented from\r\nCreizenach, i. 60; Köppen, 10. The latter studies the verbal relation of\r\nthe texts much more fully than can be done here. Meyer, 38, argues for\r\ntheir origin in an archetype from Germany. There are doubtless many other\r\ntexts yet unprinted. Ch. Magnin, _Journal de l’Instruction publique_,\r\nSept. 13, 1835, mentions such in Soleures, Fribourg, and Besançon\r\n_Rituals_.\r\n\r\n[174] Text in Du Méril, 151; Martene, iii. 44, from Limoges _Ordinarium_\r\nof unspecified date. The version is partly metrical, and the action took\r\nplace ‘cantato offertorio, antequam eant ad offerendum.’\r\n\r\n[175] Text in Gasté, 49; Du Méril, 153; Davidson, 176; from _Rouen MS._\r\nY. 110 (fourteenth-century _Ordinarium_); Coussemaker, 242, from _Bibl.\r\nNat. Lat. MS._ 904 (thirteenth-century _Gradual_, with notation); _P. L._\r\ncxlvii. 135, from _B. N._ 904 and _B. N. Lat._ 1213 (fifteenth-century\r\n_Ordinarium_); cf. Gasté, 3. The rubric begins ‘Officium regum trium\r\nsecundum usum Rothomagensem. Die epyphaniae, tercia cantata.’ John of\r\nAvranches (†1070) describing the Epiphany service, probably of Rouen,\r\nsays, after mentioning the _Evangelium genealogiae_, which follows the\r\nninth _responsorium_ of Matins, ‘Deinde stellae officium incipiat’ (_P.\r\nL._ cxlvii. 43). Gasté, 53, quotes some Rouen chapter orders. In 1379\r\nPeter Chopillard, painter, was paid ‘pro pingendo baculos quos portant\r\nReges die Apparitionis.’ In 1507 the chapter after ‘matura deliberatio’\r\nordered the ‘representatio trium Regum’ to be held. In 1521 they\r\nsuppressed it.\r\n\r\n[176] Texts ed. L. Delisle, in _Romania_, iv (1875), 1. The earlier\r\nversion is from _Bibl. Nat. Lat._ 9449 (†1060, a _Gradual_, or, according\r\nto Gautier, _Les Tropes_, 123, a _Troper_). The text is headed ‘Versus ad\r\nStellam faciendam.’ The later is from _B. N. Lat._ 1235 (twelfth-century\r\n_Gradual_). It is headed ‘Ad Comm[unionem].’ Of the first part, down to\r\nthe end of the interview with Herod, there are two alternative forms in\r\nthis MS. The one, a free revision of the normal text, is headed:\r\n\r\n  ‘Sic speciem veteres stellae struxere parentes,\r\n  quatinus hos pueri versus psallant duo regi.’\r\n\r\n[177] Text in K. A. M. Hartmann, _Über das altspanische Dreikönigsspiel_\r\n(Leipzig Diss. 1879), 43, from eleventh-century _B. N. Lat. MS._ 16,819.\r\n\r\n[178] This line is not actually in the Compiègne text. But it is in\r\nmost of the later versions of this scene, and is interesting, as being\r\na classical tag from Sallust, _Catilina_, c. 32; cf. Köppen, 21;\r\nCreizenach, i. 63. Reminiscences of _Aeneid_, viii. 112; ix. 376, are\r\nsometimes put into Herod’s mouth in the scene with the _Magi_ (Du Méril,\r\n164, 166).\r\n\r\n[179] The version is described, but unfortunately not printed by Gasté,\r\n53. It is from the _De ratione divini officii_ in _Montpellier MS._ H.\r\n304.\r\n\r\n[180] Text, headed ‘Ordo Stellae’ in U. Chevalier, _Ordinaires de\r\nl’église de Laon_, xxxvi, 389 from _Laon MS._ 263 (thirteenth-century\r\n_Trophonarium_).\r\n\r\n[181] Text printed by Lange in _Zeitsch. f. deutsch. Alterthum_, xxxii.\r\n412, from _B. M. Add. MS._ 23,922 (_Antiphoner_ of †1200). The play was\r\n‘In octava Epiphaniae’ after the _Magnificat_ at Vespers.\r\n\r\n[182] Text in C. Cahier and A. Martin, _Mélanges d’Archéologie_, i.\r\n(1847-9), 258; Clément, 113, from eleventh-century _Evangeliarium_, now\r\nin a Bollandist monastery in Brussels (Meyer, 41). It is a revision of\r\nthe normal text. The author has been so industrious as even to put many\r\nof the rubrics in hexameters. The opening is\r\n\r\n  ‘_Ordo._ Post Benedicamus puerorum splendida coetus\r\n  ad regem pariter debent protendere gressu,\r\n  praeclara voce necnon istic resonare.’\r\n\r\nThe ‘rex’ who presided and possibly acted Herod (cf. p. 56) was, I\r\nsuppose, an Epiphany king or ‘rex fatuorum.’\r\n\r\n[183] Translation only in P. Piolin, _Théâtre chrétien dans le Maine_\r\n(1891), 21. The exact source is not given.\r\n\r\n[184] The first text in Du Méril, 156; Davidson, 174, from _Munich\r\nMS._ 6264ᵃ (eleventh century). Apparently it begins with a bit of dumb\r\nshow, ‘Rex sedens in solio quaerat consilium: exeat edictum ut pereant\r\ncontinuo qui detrahunt eius imperio.’ Then comes ‘Angelus, in primis.’\r\nSecond text, headed ‘Ordo Rachaelis’ in Du Méril, 171; Froning, 871, from\r\n_Munich MS._ 6264 (eleventh century). It is mainly metrical.\r\n\r\n[185] Texts in Du Méril, 162, 175; Davidson, 175; Coussemaker, 143;\r\nWright, 32, from _Orleans MS._ 178. The first part begins with the\r\nrubric ‘Parato Herode et ceteris personis ...’; the second with ‘Ad\r\ninterfectionem Puerorum....’\r\n\r\n[186] Wordsworth, 147, suggests that the name ‘Le Galilee,’ given at\r\nLincoln to a room over the south porch and also found elsewhere, may be\r\n‘derived from some incident in the half-dramatic Paschal ceremonies.’ For\r\nanother liturgical drama in which ‘Galilee’ is required as a scene, cf.\r\np. 60.\r\n\r\n[187] _B. N. Lat._ 1152 (eleventh century) in _Bibl. de l’École des\r\nChartes_, xxxiv. 657. Einsiedeln fragment (eleventh-twelfth century)\r\nprinted by G. Morel in _Pilger_ (1849), 401; cf. Köppen, 13.\r\n\r\n[188] Text in Du Méril, 151, from _Vienne MS._ 941 (fourteenth century).\r\nIt is entitled ‘Ad adorandum filium Dei per Stellam invitantur Eoy.’\r\nThe first three lines, headed ‘Stella,’ are an address to the ‘exotica\r\nplebs’; each of the remaining ten lines is divided between three\r\nspeakers, ‘Aureolus,’ ‘Thureolus,’ ‘Myrrheolus.’\r\n\r\n[189] On the use of tropes at these points in the Mass, cf. Frere, xix.\r\n\r\n[190] _Use of Sarum_, i. 280.\r\n\r\n[191] Martene, iii. 44; in England the royal offering is still made, by\r\nproxy, at the Chapel Royal, St. James’s (Ashton, 237).\r\n\r\n[192] I follow the epoch-making _étude_ of M. Sepet, _Les Prophètes du\r\nChrist_, in _Bibl. de l’École des Chartes_, xxviii. (1867), 1, 210, xxix.\r\n(1868), 205, 261, xxxviii. (1877), 397 (I am sorry not to be able to cite\r\nthe separate edition printed at Paris, 1878); cf. also Creizenach, i. 67;\r\nJulleville, _Myst._ i. 35; and, especially, Weber, 41. But none of these\r\nwriters could make use of the Laon version discovered by M. Chevalier.\r\nMeyer, 53, suggests that Sepet has exaggerated the importance of the\r\n_Prophetae_ in the development of the O. T. dramatic cycle.\r\n\r\n[193] Text in _P. L._ xlii. 1117; on the date cf. Weber, 41. The _lectio_\r\nis printed by Sepet, xxviii. 3.\r\n\r\n[194] At Arles it was the sixth _lectio_ at Matins on Christmas day\r\n(Sepet, xxviii. 2); at Rome the fourth lesson at Matins on Christmas\r\neve (Martene, iii. 31); at Rouen it was read at Matins two days earlier\r\n(Martene, iii. 34); in the _Sarum Breviary_, i. cxxxv, it makes the\r\nfourth, fifth, and sixth _lectiones_ at Matins on the fourth Sunday in\r\nAdvent.\r\n\r\n[195] _Bucol._ iv. 7.\r\n\r\n[196] Eusebius, _Orat. Const. Magn. ad Sanctorum Coetum_, c. 18 (_P.G._\r\nxx. 1288). On the _Iudicii Signum_ and the _Dit des quinze Signes_ (Text\r\nin Grass, _Adamsspiel_, 57) derived from it, cf. Sepet, xxviii. 8; Du\r\nMéril, 185. According to Martene, iii. 34, the _Versus Sibyllae_ were\r\noften sung at Matins on Christmas day, apparently apart from the _sermo_.\r\nThus at Limoges they were sung after the sixth _responsorium_.\r\n\r\n[197] Sepet, xxviii. 13; cf. p. 5.\r\n\r\n[198] Text in Du Méril, 179; Coussemaker, 11; Wright, 60; from _Bibl.\r\nNat. Lat._ 1139 (eleventh or twelfth century). Weber, 51, gives an\r\ninteresting account of the _Prophetae_ in art, and points out that the\r\nplay seems to have influenced such representations in Italy early in the\r\neleventh century.\r\n\r\n[199] Text in U. Chevalier, _Ordinaires de l’Église de Laon_, xxxvi, 385,\r\nfrom _Laon MS._ 263 (thirteenth century _Trophonarium_). It is headed\r\n‘Ordo Prophetarum.’\r\n\r\n[200] Text in Gasté, 4, from _Rouen MS._ Y. 110 (fourteenth-century\r\n_Ordinarium_). The opening is ‘Nota, Cantor; si _Festum Asinorum_\r\nfiat, processio ordinetur post Terciam. Si non fiat Festum, tunc fiat\r\nprocessio, ut nunc praenotatur. Ordo _Processionis Asinorum_ secundum\r\nRothomagensem usum. Tercia cantata, paratis Prophetis iuxta suum\r\nordinem, fornace in medio navis ecclesiae lintheo et stuppis constituta,\r\nprocessio moveat de claustro, et duo clerici de secunda sede, in cappis,\r\nprocessionem regant, hos versus canentes: _Gloriosi et famosi_....\r\nTunc processio in medio ecclesiae stet.’ At the end the ‘Prophetae et\r\nministri’ rule the choir. Unfortunately the MS., like other _Ordinaria_,\r\nonly gives the first words of many of the chants.\r\n\r\n[201] The _Gloriosi et famosi_ hymn occurs in a twelfth-century\r\nEinsiedeln MS. (Milchsack, 36) as an overture to the _Quem quaeritis_. It\r\nis arranged for ‘chorus’ and ‘Prophetae,’ and was therefore borrowed from\r\nChristmas. It is followed by another hymn, more strictly Paschal, the\r\n_Hortum praedestinatio_, and this, which is also used with the Sens _Quem\r\nquaeritis_ (Milchsack, 58), is sung at the end of the Rouen _Prophetae_\r\nby ‘omnes prophetae et ministri [? = vocatores] in pulpito’—a curious\r\ndouble borrowing between the two feasts. Meyer, 51, argues that the\r\nEinsiedeln MS., which is in a fragmentary state, contained a _Prophetae_,\r\nto which, and not to the _Quem quaeritis_, the _Gloriosi et famosi_\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\n[202] Sepet, xxviii. 25.\r\n\r\n[203] So says Gasté, 4. But I think he must be wrong, for the _Introit_\r\nwith which the text concludes is _Puer natus est_, which belongs to the\r\n_Magna missa_ of the feast-day, and not to the eve.\r\n\r\n[204] Martene, iii. 41, from a fourteenth-century _Rituale_: ‘dicto\r\nversiculo tertii nocturni, accenditur totum luminare, et veniunt\r\nProphetae in capitulo revestiti, et post cantant insimul _Lumen Patris_,\r\net clericus solus dicit _In gaudio_, et post legitur septima lectio.\r\nPost nonam lectionem ducunt prophetas de capitulo ad portam Thesaurarii\r\ncantilenas cantando, et post in chorum, ubi dicunt cantori prophetias,\r\net duo clericuli in pulpito cantando eos appellant. Post dicitur nonum\r\n[responsorium?] in pulpito.... Post [primam] recitatur miraculum [Martene\r\nconjectures _martyrologium_] in claustro ... [Ad vesperas] dictis psalmis\r\net antiphonis, ducunt ad portam Thesaurarii prophetas, sicut ad matutinum\r\net reducunt in chorum similiter, et habent clerici virgas plenas candelis\r\nardentibus, vocant eos clerici duo sicut ad vesperas [? matutinum].’\r\nPresently follows the _Deposuit_: cf. vol. i. p. 309.\r\n\r\n[205] Cf. vol. i. p. 313.\r\n\r\n[206] Gasté, 20.\r\n\r\n[207] Sepet, xxviii. 219, suggests that Balaam, when first introduced\r\ninto the _Prophetae_, merely prophesied, as he does in the _Adam_ (Grass,\r\n46). Possibly, yet his introduction at the end of the Laon play (unknown\r\nto Sepet) looks as if he were an appendix for the sake of his ass.\r\n\r\n[208] Champollion-Figeac, _Hilarii Versus et Ludi_ (1838), from _B. N.\r\nLat. MS._ 11,331. The plays are also printed by Du Méril, _Or. Lat._ On\r\nthe life cf. _Hist. Litt. de la France_, xx. 627; _D.N.B._ s.v. Hilary;\r\nMorley, _English Writers_, iii. 107.\r\n\r\n[209] Du Méril, 272 ‘Ludus super iconia Sancti Nicolai.’ There is a\r\n‘persona iconie.’ A _Barbarus_ speaks partly in French.\r\n\r\n[210] Du Méril, 225 ‘Suscitatio Lazari: ad quam istae personae sunt\r\nnecessariae: Persona Lazari, duarum Sororum, quatuor Iudaeorum, Iesu\r\nChristi, duodecim Apostolorum, vel sex ad minus ... (ends). Quo finito,\r\nsi factum fuerit ad Matutinas, Lazarus in piat: _Te Deum laudamus_: si\r\nvero ad Vesperas: _Magnificat anima mea Dominum_.’\r\n\r\n[211] Du Méril, 241 ‘Historia de Daniel repraesentanda,’ with a list\r\nof the ‘personae necessariae’ and a final rubric as in the ‘Suscitatio\r\nLazari’: cf. Sepet, xxviii. 232, on this and similar plays and their\r\nrelation to the _Prophetae_. From the names ‘Hilarius,’ ‘Iordanus,’\r\n‘Simon,’ attached to parts of the _Daniel_ in the MS., it would seem that\r\nHilarius had collaborators for this play (Sepet, xxviii. 248).\r\n\r\n[212] E. Dümmler, in _Z. f. d. Alterthum_, xxxv. 401; xxxvi. 238, from\r\n_B. M. Addl. MS._ 22,414 (‘Liber Sancti Godehardi in Hild[esheim]’). On\r\nthe group of Nicholas plays cf. Creizenach, i. 105.\r\n\r\n[213] G. Morel, in _Anzeiger für Kunde der deutschen Vorzeit_, vi.\r\n(1859), 207, from _Einsiedeln MS._ 34.\r\n\r\n[214] _Golden Legend_, ii. 109; Wace, _Vie de Saint-Nicolas_ (ed. Delius,\r\n1850).\r\n\r\n[215] Du Méril, 262; Coussemaker, 100. The play ends with the _Te Deum_.\r\nThe same subject is treated in the Einsiedeln play, and one of those from\r\nHildesheim.\r\n\r\n[216] Du Méril, 254; Coussemaker, 83. The play ends with the anthem ‘O\r\nChristi pietas,’ used at second Vespers on St. Nicholas’ day (_Sarum\r\nBreviary_, iii. 38). The same subject is treated in the other Hildesheim\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n[217] Du Méril, 276; Coussemaker, 123; begins ‘Ad repraesentandum quomodo\r\nSanctus Nicolaus, &c. ...’: ends with anthem ‘Copiosae caritatis’ used at\r\nLauds on St. Nicholas’ day (_Sarum Breviary_, iii. 37).\r\n\r\n[218] Du Méril, 266; Coussemaker, 109; begins ‘Aliud miraculum de Sancto\r\nNicolao, &c. ...’: ends with anthem ‘Statuit ei Dominus,’ not in _Sarum\r\nBreviary_, but used at Rome as _Introit_ on feasts of Pontiffs. This is\r\nthe subject of Hilarius’ play.\r\n\r\n[219] Text in Du Méril, 213; Coussemaker, 220. The play contains a\r\nPaschal sequence and ends with a _Te Deum_. Part of the action is in\r\na _platea_; Simon has a _domus_, which afterwards ‘efficiatur quasi\r\nBethania.’ Other ‘loci’ represent ‘Ierusalem’ and ‘Galilaea’ (cf. p. 50),\r\nand the ‘Suscitatio’ takes place at a ‘monumentum’ (probably the Easter\r\nsepulchre).\r\n\r\n[220] Text in Coussemaker, 49, and Danjou, _Revue de la Musique\r\nreligieuse_, iv. (1848), 65. Cf. Sepet, xxviii. 232, and on the MS.,\r\nvol. i. p. 284. As in the Beauvais _Officium Circumcisionis_, there are\r\nmany processional chants or _conductus_, in one of which are the terms\r\n‘celebremus Natalis solempnia’ and ‘in hoc Natalitio’ which attach the\r\nplay to Christmas, or at least the Christmas season. The text begins\r\n‘Incipit Danielis ludus,’ and ends with the _Te Deum_. The following\r\nquatrain serves as prologue:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ad honorem tui, Christe,\r\n  Danielis ludus iste\r\n  in Belvaco est inventus\r\n  et invenit hunc iuventus.’\r\n\r\nMeyer, 56, finds relations between the Beauvais _Daniel_ and that of\r\n_Hilarius_.\r\n\r\n[221] Text in _Anzeiger für Kunde d. deutschen Vorzeit_ (1877), 169, from\r\nlate twelfth-century MS.; cf. Creizenach, i. 74.\r\n\r\n[222] Cf. p. 99.\r\n\r\n[223] Creizenach, i. 6, 71. The unauthentic _Annales_ of Corvei mention\r\nalso a play on _Joseph_ under the year 1264 (Creizenach, i. 75).\r\n\r\n[224] Text in Du Méril, 237; Coussemaker, 210; begins ‘Ad repraesentandam\r\nconversionem beati Pauli apostoli, &c. ...’: ends with _Te Deum_. Four\r\n‘sedes’ are required, and a ‘lectus’ for Ananias.\r\n\r\n[225] Latest text, with long introduction, mainly philological, by W.\r\nCloetta, in _Romania_, xxii. (1893), 177; others by Du Méril, 233;\r\nCoussemaker, 1; E. Boehmer, in _Romanische Studien_, iv. 99; K. Bartsch,\r\n_Lang. et Litt. françaises_, 13; cf. also Julleville, _Les Myst._ i. 27;\r\nE. Stengel, _Z. f. rom. Phil._ iii. 233; E. Schwan, _Z. f. rom. Phil._\r\nxi. 469; H. Morf, _Z. f. rom. Phil._ xx. 385. The manuscript is _Bibl.\r\nNat. Lat._ 1139. MM. Cloetta (p. 221) and G. Paris (_Litt. fr. au moyen\r\nâge²_, 237, 246) assign the _Sponsus_ to the earlier half or second third\r\nof the twelfth century, and the former, with the delightful diffidence\r\nof a philologist, thinks, on linguistic grounds, that it was written at\r\nSaint Amant de Boixe (sixteen _kilomètres_ north of Angoulême). It only\r\nremains for some archivist to find a clerk of St. Martial of Limoges\r\nwhose native place was this very village.\r\n\r\n[226] Cf. p. 33.\r\n\r\n[227] H. Morf, _loc. cit._, considers the _Sponsus_ an Easter play.\r\n\r\n[228] Creizenach, i. 77. An Italian dramatic _Lauda_ on the same subject\r\nis headed ‘In Dominica de Adventu’ (D’Ancona, i. 141).\r\n\r\n[229] Text in Froning, 206, from edition of Zezschwitz, _Vom römischen\r\nKaisertum deutscher Nation_ (1877). The earliest edition is by Pez,\r\n_Thesaurus Anecd. Noviss._ (1721-9), ii. 3, 187. This writer introduced\r\nconfusion by giving the play the title _Ludus paschalis de adventu et\r\ninteritu Antichristi_. It has nothing to do with Easter. The latest and\r\nbest edition is that by W. Meyer, in _Sitzungsberichte d. hist.-phil.\r\nClasse d. königl. bayr. Akad. d. Wiss._ (Munich), 1882, 1. The unique\r\nMS. is _Munich MS._ 19,411 (twelfth-thirteenth century), formerly in\r\nKloster Tegernsee. Both Zezschwitz and Meyer have long and valuable\r\nintroductions; cf. also Froning, 199; Creizenach, i. 78. T. Wright prints\r\nthe play from Pez, in _Chester Plays_, ii. 227.\r\n\r\n[230] 2 _Thessalonians_, ii. 3-12. According to _York Missal_, i. 10,\r\npart of this passage is read at Mass on Saturday in the _Quatuor Tempora_\r\nof Advent.\r\n\r\n[231] ‘Templum domini et vii sedes regales primum collocentur in hunc\r\nmodum:\r\n\r\n    Ad orientem templum domini; huic collocantur sedes regis\r\n    Hierosolimorum et sedes Sinagogae.\r\n\r\n    Ad occidentem sedes imperatoris Romani; huic collocantur sedes\r\n    regis Theotonicorum et sedes regis Francorum.\r\n\r\n    Ad austrum sedes regis Graecorum.\r\n\r\n    Ad meridiem sedes regis Babiloniae et Gentilitatis.’\r\n\r\nOther than this direction the play has no heading, but in later\r\nstage-directions it is incidentally called a ‘ludus.’\r\n\r\n[232] Printed in _P. L._ ci. 1291.\r\n\r\n[233] Pseudo-Augustine, _De altercatione Ecclesiae et Synagogae dialogus_\r\nin _P. L._ xlii. 1131. On this theme and the _débats_ based thereon cf.\r\n_Hist. Litt._ xxiii. 216; G. Paris, § 155; Pearson, ii. 376. P. Weber,\r\n_Geistliches Schauspiel und kirchliche Kunst_ (1894), is mainly occupied\r\nwith this motive and its place in the religious drama and religious art.\r\nIt is a most valuable study, but I find no ground for the conjecture\r\n(Weber, 31, 36) that the _Altercatio_, like the _Prophetae_, had already,\r\nbefore the _Antichrist_, been semi-dramatically rendered in the liturgy.\r\n\r\n[234] Cf. p. 98.\r\n\r\n[235] _Representations_, s.v. Dunstable.\r\n\r\n[236] At Rouen, e.g., a confraternity played a _misterium_ on the feast\r\nof the Assumption in a waxen ‘hortus’ set up in their chapel; and this\r\nbetween 1446 and 1521 required reformation from various ‘derisiones,’\r\nespecially a ‘ludus de marmousetis’ (Gasté, 76). But I know of no\r\nevidence for a Latin Assumption play, although such may quite well have\r\nexisted. The Lincoln Assumption play was given in the cathedral, as a\r\nwind-up to a cycle (_Representations_, s.v. Lincoln).\r\n\r\n[237] Cf. p. 11.\r\n\r\n[238] Ducange, s.v. _Festum Ascensionis_, ‘qui ... officio hac die\r\npraeerat, cum modicum panis et vini degustasset, cantato responsorio _Non\r\nvos relinquam_, ambonem ascendebat, ubi ex monte efficto coelum petere\r\nvidebatur; tunc pueri symphoniaci veste angelica induti decantabant _Viri\r\nGalilaei_, etc.’\r\n\r\n[239] Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 9; _Annales archéologiques_, xviii.\r\n173 ‘pro pingendo cicatrices in manibus D.

I have three English examples: Hone,\r\n_E. D. Book_, i. 685 (_Computus_ of St. Patrick’s, Dublin, for 1509), ‘we\r\nhave ivˢ viiᵈ paid to those playing with the great and little angel and\r\nthe dragon; iiiˢ paid for little cords employed about the Holy Ghost;\r\nivˢ viᵈ for making the angel censing (_thurificantis_), and iiˢ iiᵈ for\r\ncords of it—all on the feast of Pentecost’; _Lincoln Statutes_, i. 335;\r\nii. cxviii. 165 (1330) ‘in distributione autem Pentecostali percipiet\r\n... clericus ducens columbam vj denarios’; W. Lambarde, _Alphabetical\r\nDescription of the Chief Places in England and Wales_ (1730, written in\r\nsixteenth century), 459, s.v. Wytney, ‘The like Toye I myselfe (beinge\r\nthen a Chyld) once saw in _Poules_ Church at _London_, at a Feast of\r\n_Whitsontyde_, wheare the comynge downe of the _Holy Gost_ was set forthe\r\nby a white Pigion, that was let to fly out of a Hole, that yet is to be\r\nsene in the mydst of the Roofe of the great Ile, and by a longe Censer,\r\nwhich descendinge out of the same Place almost to the verie Grounde, was\r\nswinged up and downe at suche a Lengthe, that it reached with thone Swepe\r\nalmost to the West Gate of the Churche, and with the other to the Quyre\r\nStaires of the same, breathynge out over the whole Churche and Companie\r\na most pleasant Perfume of suche swete Thinges as burned thearin; with\r\nthe like doome Shewes also, they used every whear to furnishe sondrye\r\nPartes of their Churche Service, as by their Spectacles of the Nativitie,\r\nPassion, and Ascension of _Christe_.’ From further notices in W. S.\r\nSimpson, _St. Paul’s and Old City Life_, 62, 83, it appears that the\r\ncensing was on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Whit-week, that the Lord\r\nMayor attended, and that the ceremony was replaced by sermons in 1548.\r\n\r\n[241] Creizenach, i. 76; D’Ancona, i. 90, 92, 114 (Padua, Venice,\r\nTrevigi), and i. 29 (Parma _Ordinarium_ of fifteenth century) ‘ad\r\ninducendum populum ad contritionem, ... ad confirmandum ipsum in\r\ndevotione Virginis Mariae ... fit reverenter et decenter Repraesentatio\r\nVirginis Mariae ... cum prophetis et aliis solemnitatibus opportunis’;\r\nCoussemaker, 280 (Cividale _Processionalia_ of fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries). In the fourteenth century there was a procession\r\nto the market-place, where ‘diaconus legat evangelium in tono, et\r\nfit repraesentatio Angeli ad Mariam.’ In the fifteenth century ‘In\r\nAnnuntiatione B. M. Virginis Repraesentatio’ was a similar procession\r\nand ‘cantatur evangelium cum ludo, quo finito, revertendo ad ecclesiam,\r\ncantatur Te Deum.’ The text goes slightly beyond the words of the Gospel\r\n(Luke i. 26-38) having a part for ‘Helisabeth.’ Gasté, 79, describes the\r\nfoundation of a _mystère_ of the Annunciation during vespers on the eve\r\nof the feast at Saint-Lo, in 1521.\r\n\r\n[242] I gather this from the _consuetudo_ of giving gloves to Mary,\r\nthe Angel, and the Prophets at Christmas (_Representations_, s.v.\r\nLincoln). Here, as at Parma, the _Prophetae_ appear in connexion with the\r\nAnnunciation ceremony.\r\n\r\n[243] See the curious and detailed document in Appendix S as to the\r\nTournai ceremony founded by Peter Cotrel in the sixteenth century. A\r\nprecisely similar foundation was that of Robert Fabri at Saint Omer in\r\n1543 (_Bull. arch. du Comité des travaux historiques_ (1886), 80; _Mém.\r\nde la Soc. des Antiquaires de la Morinie_, xx. 207). The inventory of\r\nthe ‘ornementz et parementz’ in a ‘coffre de cuir boully’ includes ‘ung\r\ncolomb de bois revestu de damas blancq.’ Alike at Tournai, St. Omer,\r\nand Besançon (Martene, iii. 30) the ceremony was on the Wednesday in\r\nthe _Quatuor Tempora_ of Advent. For the ‘golden Mass’ of this day the\r\nGospel is the same as that of the Annunciation; cf. _York Missal_, i. 6;\r\nPfannenschmidt, 438.\r\n\r\n[244] Creizenach, i. 154, 317, 346. A slight addition to the _Stella_ is\r\nmade by two Provençal plays of †1300 (ed. P. Meyer in _Romania_, xiv.\r\n496) and 1333 (_dramatis personae_ only in _Revue des Sociétés savantes_,\r\nviii. 259) which introduce episodes from the life of the Virgin previous\r\nto the Nativity.\r\n\r\n[245] Creizenach, i. 70, quoting _Gesta Alberti Livoniensis episcopi_\r\n(†1226) in Gruber, _Origines Livoniae_ (1740), 34 ‘Eadem hyeme factus\r\nest ludus prophetarum ordinatissimus, quam Latini Comoediam vocant, in\r\nmedia Riga, ut fidei Christianae rudimenta gentilitas fide etiam disceret\r\noculata. Cuius ludi et comoediae materia tam neophytis, quam paganis, qui\r\naderant, per interpretem diligentissime exponebatur. Ubi autem armati\r\nGedeonis cum Philistaeis pugnabant; pagani, timentes occidi, fugere\r\ncoeperunt, sed caute sunt revocati.... In eodem ludo erant bella, vtpote\r\nDauid, Gedeonis, Herodis. Erat et doctrina Veteris et Novi Testamenti.’\r\n\r\n[246] Text edited by V. Luzarche (Tours, 1854); L. Palustre (Paris,\r\n1877); K. Bartsch, _Chrestomathie_, (ed. 1880, 91); K. Grass (Halle,\r\n1891); cf. the elaborate study by Sepet, xxix, 105, 261, and Julleville,\r\n_Les Myst._ i. 81; ii. 217; Creizenach, i. 130; Clédat, 15. The\r\nmanuscript is _Tours MS._ 927, formerly belonging to the Benedictines of\r\nMarmoutier. Grass, vi, summarizes the opinions as to its date. In any\r\ncase the text is probably of the twelfth century, and Grass, 171, after\r\nan elaborate grammatical investigation, confirms the opinion of Luzarche,\r\ndoubted by Littré and others, that it is of Anglo-Norman rather than\r\nNorman origin. But, even if the writer was an Anglo-Norman clerk, the\r\nplay must have been written for performance in France. I doubt if it was\r\never actually played or finished. It is followed in the MS. by a Norman\r\n(not Anglo-Norman) poem on the Fifteen Signs of Judgement (text in Grass,\r\n57), which looks like material collected for an unwritten Sibyl prophecy.\r\nThe remaining contents of the first part of the MS., which may be of the\r\ntwelfth century, are some hymns and the Latin Tours _Quem quaeritis_ (p.\r\n38).\r\n\r\n[247] Sepet, xxix, 112, 128, points out that certain _lectiones_ and\r\n_responsoria_ which accompany the _Adam_ and _Cain and Abel_ are taken\r\nfrom the office for Septuagesima. Possibly an independent liturgical\r\ndrama of the Fall arose at Septuagesima and was absorbed by the\r\n_Prophetae_. But mention of the ‘primus Adam’ is not uncommon in the\r\nNativity liturgy; cf. Sepet, xxix, 107, and the _Sponsus_ (p. 61).\r\n\r\n[248] _Annales Ratisponenses_ (_M. G. H. Scriptores_, xvii. 590) ‘Anno\r\nDomini 1194. Celebratus est in Ratispona ordo creacionis angelorum\r\net ruina[e] Luciferi et suorum, et creacionis hominis et casus et\r\nprophetarum ... septima Idus Februarii.’\r\n\r\n[249] Köppen, 35, discusses the textual relation between the St. Gall and\r\nBenedictbeuern plays and their common source, the Freising _Stella_.\r\n\r\n[250] Text in Mone, _Schauspiele des Mittelalters_, i. 143; cf.\r\nCreizenach, i. 123.\r\n\r\n[251] Text in Schmeller, _Carmina Burana_, 80; Du Méril, 187; Froning,\r\n877, from a Munich MS. of thirteenth to fourteenth century formerly in\r\nthe abbey of Benedictbeuern in Bavaria; cf. Creizenach, i. 96; Sepet,\r\nxxxviii, 398. The title ‘Ludus scenicus de nativitate Domini’ given by\r\nSchmeller is not in the MS.\r\n\r\n[252] Cf. p. 56. The Balaam in _Adam_ is ‘sedens super asinam,’ but no\r\nfurther notice is taken of the animal.\r\n\r\n[253] Text ed. Le Verdier (_Soc. des Bibliophiles normands_); cf.\r\nJulleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 36, 430.\r\n\r\n[254] Cf. p. 38.\r\n\r\n[255] Tischendorf, _Evangelia Apocrypha_ (1876), 389.\r\n\r\n[256] Cf. pp. 4, 5, 20. One of the anthems for Easter Saturday in the\r\n_Sarum Breviary_ is _Elevamini, portae_.\r\n\r\n[257] Text in Pollard, 166; K. Böddeker, _Altenglische Dichtungen des\r\nMS. Harl._ 2253 (1878), 264; E. Mall, _The Harrowing of Hell_ (1871);\r\ncf. Ten Brink, ii. 242; Ward, i. 90; Creizenach, i. 158. There are three\r\nMSS.: (_a_) _Bodl. Digby MS._ 86 (late thirteenth century); (_b_) _Harl.\r\nMS._ 2253 (†1310); (_c_) _Edin. Advoc. Libr._ (_Auchinleck_) _MS._ W. 41\r\n(early fourteenth century). The Digby version has a prologue beginning:\r\n\r\n  ‘Hou ihesu crist herewede helle\r\n  Of hardegates ich wille telle.’\r\n\r\nThe Harleian has:\r\n\r\n  ‘Alle herkneth to me nou,\r\n  A strif will I tellen ou.’\r\n\r\nThe Auchinleck prologue lacks the beginning, but the end agrees with the\r\nHarleian. Böddeker, who accepts the dramatic character of the piece,\r\nthinks that the prologues were prefixed later for recitation. In any case\r\nthis poem became a source for a play in the _Ludus Coventriae_ cycle\r\n(Pollard, xxxviii).\r\n\r\n[258] Text of Muri fragments in Froning, 228; cf. Creizenach, i. 114;\r\nWirth, 133, 281. A French fragment (†1300-50) also introducing this\r\ntheme is printed by J. Bédier, in _Romania_, xxiv. (1895), 86. Pez,\r\n_Script. rerum austriacarum_, ii. 268, describes a vision of the\r\nthirteenth-century recluse Wilbirgis: ‘Item quadam nocte Dominicae\r\nResurrectionis, cum in Monasterio ludus Paschalis tam a Clero quam a\r\npopulo ageretur, quia eidem non potuit corporaliter interesse, coepit\r\ndesiderare, ut ei Dominus aliquam specialis consolationis gratiam per\r\nResurrectionis suae gaudia largiretur. Et vidit quasi Dominum ad Inferos\r\ndescendentem et inde animas eruentem, quae quasi columbae candidissimae\r\ncircumvolantes ipsum comitabantur, et sequebantur ab inferis redeuntem.’\r\nMeyer, 61, 98, deals fully with the development of the Resurrection and\r\nHarrowing of Hell themes in the early vernacular plays.\r\n\r\n[259] Text in Monmerqué et Michel, _Théâtre fr. au moyen âge_, 10, from\r\n_Bibl. Nat. fr._ 902; cf. Creizenach, i. 135; Julleville, _Les Myst._\r\ni. 91; ii. 220; Clédat, 59. The MS. is of the fourteenth century,\r\nbut the Norman-French, which some writers, as with the _Adam_, think\r\nAnglo-Norman, is assigned to the end of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\n[260] D’Ancona, i. 90. The original authority for the statement, taken\r\nfrom a MS. treatise on the _Commedia italiana_ by Uberto Benvoglienti, is\r\nnot given.\r\n\r\n[261] D’Ancona, i. 87, quoting several chronicles: ‘hoc anno in festo\r\nPascae facta fuit Reppraesentatio Passionis et Resurrectionis Christi\r\nsolemniter et ordinate in Prato Vallis.’\r\n\r\n[262] Text in Schmeller, _Carmina Burana_, 95; Du Méril, 126; Froning,\r\n284; cf. Creizenach, i. 92; Wirth, 131, 278. The only heading to the play\r\nin the MS. is ‘Sancta Maria assit nostro principio! amen.’\r\n\r\n[263] Scenes between the _Mercator_, his wife, and their lad Rubin play a\r\nlarge part in the later German Passion plays; cf. Wirth, 168.\r\n\r\n[264] Creizenach, i. 155. Two fourteenth-century texts exist, one in\r\nProvençal, one in Catalan.\r\n\r\n[265] Text in Mone, _Schauspiele des Mittelalters_, i. 72; cf.\r\nCreizenach, i. 121; Wirth, 135, 282.\r\n\r\n[266] Text in Froning, 340 (begins ‘Incipit ordo sive registrum de\r\npassione domini’); cf. Creizenach, i. 219; Wirth, 137, 295.\r\n\r\n[267] Text in Froning, 305 (begins ‘Ad materiae reductionem de passione\r\ndomini. Incipit ludus pascalis’); cf. Creizenach, i. 92, 120; Wirth, 134,\r\n293.\r\n\r\n[268] Giuliano da Cividale, _Cronaca Friulana_ (D’Ancona, i. 91;\r\nMuratori, _Rer. Ital. Script._ xxiv. 1205, 1209): ‘Anno domini\r\nMCCLXXXXVIII die vii exeunte Maio, videlicet in die Pentecostes et in\r\naliis duobus sequentibus diebus, facta fuit Repraesentatio Ludi Christi,\r\nvidelicet Passionis, Resurrectionis, Ascensionis, Adventus Spiritus\r\nSancti, Adventus Christi ad iudicium, in curia Domini Patriarchae\r\nAustriae civitatis, honorifice et laudabiliter, per Clerum civitatensem\r\n....

(Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 379). Besides\r\nthe English cosmic cycles, there are several fifteenth-century French\r\nones described by Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 394 sqq.: in Germany plays\r\nof this scope are rare.\r\n\r\n[269] Pearson, ii. 312; Köppen, 49; Ten Brink, i. 287.\r\n\r\n[270] Cf.

Rothschild, 1878-91, for _Soc. des anciens textes français_),\r\nis a fifteenth-century compilation of O. T. plays from various sources.\r\n\r\n[271] French versions of the _Vengeance de Notre Seigneur_, of which the\r\nchief episode is the Siege of Jerusalem, appear in the fifteenth century\r\n(Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 12, 415, 451).

In\r\nFrance, minor religious plays at least took place on scaffolds, built up\r\nsometimes against the wall of a church (Bapst, 23, 29). A raised stage,\r\nwith _sedes_ along the back of it, is shown by the miniatures in the MS.\r\nof the Valenciennes _Passion_ (reproduced in Jusserand, _Shakespeare in\r\nFrance_, 63; cf. Julleville, _Les Mystères_, ii. 153); but this is as\r\nlate as 1547.\r\n\r\n[282] Julleville, _Les Myst._ i. 386; Bapst, 28.\r\n\r\n[283] Cf. p. 137. Amongst the ‘establies’ required for the Rouen play\r\nof 1474 was ‘Enfer faict en maniere d’une grande gueulle se cloant et\r\nouvrant quant besoing en est’ (Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 37). Just such\r\nan ‘enfer’ is represented in the Fouquet and Valenciennes miniatures.\r\n\r\n[284] Cf. p. 98.\r\n\r\n[285] Cf. p. 77.\r\n\r\n[286] Froning, 363 ‘Et notandum, quod optime congruit, ne populus nimiam\r\nmoram faciendo gravetur, et ut resurrectio domini gloriosius celebretur,\r\nut ulterior ordo ludi in diem alterum conservetur; quod si apud rectores\r\ndeliberatum fuerit, Augustinus coram populo proclamet dicens sine rigmo,\r\nut in die crastino revertatur.’\r\n\r\n[287] Creizenach, i. 340.\r\n\r\n[288] Cf. p. 130.\r\n\r\n[289] Cf. p. 74. By the fifteenth century lay performers appear even in\r\nthe ritual _Quem quaeritis_. An Augsburg version of 1487 (Milchsack, 129)\r\nconcludes ‘Permittitur tamen aliis, qui forsan huiusmodi personas [i.e.\r\n‘sacerdotes’ et ‘cantores’] non habent, ut cum aliis personis et etiam\r\nmoribus honestis tamen et discretis, huiusmodi visitationem sepulchri\r\nexequantur.’ See also the jest of Tyll Ulenspiegel with the parson’s\r\nconcubine who played the angel, quoted by Pearson, ii. 308.\r\n\r\n[290] Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 2.

Fuerunt coronati tres\r\nReges in equis magnis, vallati domicellis, vestiti variis, cum somariis\r\nmultis et familia magna nimis. Et fuit stella aurea discurrens per aera,\r\nquae praecedebat istos tres Reges, et pervenerunt ad columnas Sancti\r\nLaurentii, ubi erat rex Herodes effigiatus, cum scribis et sapientibus.\r\nEt visi sunt interrogare regem Herodem, ubi Christus nasceretur, et\r\nrevolutis multis libris responderunt, quod deberet nasci in civitate\r\nBethleem in distantia quinque milliariorum a Hierusalem. Quo audito, isti\r\ntres Reges coronati aureis coronis, tenentes in manibus scyphos aureos\r\ncum auro, thure et myrrha, praecedente stella per aera, cum somariis\r\net mirabili famulatu, clangentibus tubis, et bucinis praecedentibus,\r\nsimiis, babuynis, et diversis generibus animalium, cum mirabili populorum\r\ntumultu, pervenerunt ad ecclesiam Sancti Eustorgii. Ubi in latere altaris\r\nmaioris erat praesepium cum bove et asino, et in praesepio erat Christus\r\nparvulus in brachiis Virginis matris. Et isti Reges obtulerunt Christo\r\nmunera; deinde visi sunt dormire, et Angelus alatus ei dixit quod non\r\nredirent per contratam Sancti Laurentii, sed per portam Romanam: quod et\r\nfactum fuit. Et fuit tantus concursus populi et militum et dominarum et\r\nclericorum, quod nunquam similis fere visus fuit. Et fuit ordinatum, quod\r\nomni anno istud festum fieret.’ This is precisely the liturgic _Stella_\r\ntranslated into an out-of-door _spectacle_, which in its turn becomes the\r\nmodel for many a Quattrocento painting; cf., e.g., Botticelli’s _Magi_ in\r\nthe Uffizi, or Gentile da Fabriano’s, with the baboons done to the life,\r\nin the Accademia.\r\n\r\n[309] D’Ancona, i. 94, 301, considers, however, that the late\r\nfifteenth-century _Passio_ of Revello was not a native growth, but\r\nmodelled on contemporary cyclic plays from France.\r\n\r\n[310] The Rouen play of 1474 (Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 36) was one,\r\nand cf. pp. 119, 122.\r\n\r\n[311] Creizenach, i. 242; cf. the lists in Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii.\r\n183.\r\n\r\n[312] Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 9 sqq.\r\n\r\n[313] D’Ancona, i. 218; Guasti, _Le feste di San Giovanni Baptista in\r\nFirenze_ (1884). _Rappresentazioni_ on St. John’s day were known to\r\nthe late fourteenth-century Florentine historian Goro di Stagio Dati.\r\nAn account of the feast in 1407 makes no mention of them, but they\r\nappear in that of 1439, and are elaborately described in the _Storia_\r\nof Matteo di Marco Palmieri about 1454 (D’Ancona, i. 228). Early in\r\nthe morning of June 22 started a procession of clergy, _compagnie_,\r\n_edifizii_, and _cavalleria_. These stopped in the Piazza della\r\nSignoria, and _rappresentazioni_, forming a complete cycle from the\r\nFall of Lucifer to the Last Judgement, and lasting sixteen hours, were\r\ngiven upon the _edifizii_. D’Ancona suggests that the dumb show type of\r\n_rappresentazioni_ preceded the dialogued one, ‘come più semplice.’ But\r\nthis seems equally inconsistent with his view that the _rappresentazioni_\r\ngrew out of _devozioni_, and mine that they were an adaptation of earlier\r\ncyclical plays to the conditions of the Florentine feast.\r\n\r\n[314] Cf. ch. xxi.\r\n\r\n[315] D’Ancona, i. 243; Schack, ii. 103; Ticknor, _Hist. of Spanish Lit._\r\nii. 249. The _Autos Sacramentales_ are so named from their connexion with\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n[316] Creizenach, i. 170, 227. The earliest German mention is at the\r\ncouncil of Prague in 1366 (Höfler, _Concilia Pragensia_, 13, in _Abhandl.\r\nd. königl. böhmischen Gesellsch. der Wiss._ series v. vol. 12) ‘omnibus\r\n... clericis et laicis ... mandatur ut ludos theatrales vel etiam\r\nfistulatores vel ioculatores in festo corporis Christi in processionibus\r\nire quovis modo permittant et admittant.’ Extant _Frohnleichnamsspiele_\r\nare those of Innsbruck, †1391 (Text in Mone, _Altteutsche Schauspiele_,\r\n145), and of Künzelsau, †1479 (ed. H. Werner, in _Germania_, iv. 338).\r\nCf. the description (†1553) of Naogeorgos (transl. Googe) in Stubbes, i.\r\n337.\r\n\r\n[317] Julleville, ii. 208.\r\n\r\n[318] Ward, i. 44; Davidson, 215; Malleson-Tuker, ii. 227.\r\n\r\n[319] See e.g. the ‘Processio huius ludi’ at the end of the text of the\r\nAlsfeld Passion of 1501 (Froning, 858); cf. Pearson, ii. 365. As to the\r\ngeneral relations of processions and plays, cf. p. 160.\r\n\r\n[320] Cf. p. 136.\r\n\r\n[321] The closest merging of play and procession is suggested by an\r\norder at Draguignan in 1558 (Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 209), where it\r\nwas ordered ‘Le dit jeu jora avec la procession comme auparadvant et le\r\nplus d’istoeres et plus brieves que puront estre seront et se dira tout\r\nen cheminant sans ce que personne du jeu s’areste pour eviter prolixité\r\net confusion tant de ladite, prosession que jeu, et que les estrangiers\r\nle voient aisement.’ Perhaps the short speeches of the Innsbruck play\r\nwere similarly delivered while the procession was moving. The nearest\r\ncontinental approach to the English type is the Künzelsau play, which\r\nwas divided into three parts and played at three different stations\r\n(Creizenach, i. 227).\r\n\r\n[322] Creizenach, i. 218.\r\n\r\n[323] Creizenach, i. 128, 137 sqq., 156; Julleville, _Les Myst._ i. 95,\r\n107, 115, 185; ii. 2, 4, 5, 221, 226, 345; _Les Com._ 49; Sepet, 202,\r\n242; Clédat, 63, 73, 105.\r\n\r\n[324] Creizenach, i. 130, 165, 176; Julleville, _Les Myst._ i. 347; _Les\r\nCom._ 291; D’Ancona, i. 57; Pearson, ii. 303; Wirth, 144. A play could\r\nbe given outside the church without wholly losing its connexion with the\r\nliturgy. It became a sort of procession: cf. pp. 32, 67. D’Ancona, i. 59,\r\nquotes from _Bibl. de l’École des Chartes_, iii. 450, a licence given by\r\nthe Bishop of Langres in 1408 ‘Ut in quadem platea vel plateis congruis\r\net honestis, infra vel extra villam, prope et supra rippariam loci, coram\r\nclero et populo, alta et intelligibili voce, lingua latina et materna,\r\ncum magna reverentia et honore ac diversis personacium et habituum\r\ngeneribus ad hoc congruis et necessariis, solemniter et publice vitam et\r\nmiracula egregii confessoris et pontificis Machuti, recitare et exponere,\r\nmissamque solemnem in pontificalibus, in platea seu plateis supradictis\r\nsuper altare portatili consecrato per alterum vestrum canonicorum\r\nvel alium ydoneum sacerdotem celebrare ... licentiam et auctoritatem\r\nimpertimus per praesentes.’ Cf. the examples of plays at the Feasts of\r\nFools and of the Boy Bishop (vol. i. pp. 295, 296, 299, 304, 306, 309,\r\n313, 342, 348, 349, 380).\r\n\r\n[325] Cf. p. 16.\r\n\r\n[326] Cf. vol. i. p. 318. Pearson, ii. 285, translates: ‘The old Fathers\r\nof the Church, in order to strengthen the belief of the faithful and\r\nto attract the unbeliever by this manner of religious service, rightly\r\ninstituted at the Feast of Epiphany or the Octave religious performances\r\nof such a kind as the star guiding the Magi to the new-born Christ, the\r\ncruelty of Herod, the dispatch of the soldiers, the lying-in of the\r\nBlessed Virgin, the angel warning the Magi not to return to Herod, and\r\nother events of the birth of Christ. But what nowadays happens in many\r\nchurches? Not a customary ritual, not an act of reverence, but one of\r\nirreligion and extravagance conducted with all the license of youth. The\r\npriests having changed their clothes go forth as a troop of warriors;\r\nthere is no distinction between priest and warrior to be marked. At an\r\nunfitting gathering of priests and laymen the church is desecrated by\r\nfeasting and drinking, buffoonery, unbecoming jokes, play, the clang of\r\nweapons, the presence of shameless wenches, the vanities of the world,\r\nand all sorts of disorder. Rarely does such a gathering break up without\r\nquarrelling.’\r\n\r\n[327] On Gerhoh (1093-1169) see the article in the 2nd ed. of Wetzer and\r\nWelte’s _Kirchenlexicon_. He took a strong reforming and anti-imperial\r\nline in the controversies of his day.\r\n\r\n[328] Gerhohus, _Comm. in Ps. cxxxii_ (_P. L._ cxciv. 890) ‘Cohaerebat\r\nipsi Ecclesiae claustrum satis honestum, sed a claustrali religione\r\nomnino vacuum, cum neque in dormitorio fratres dormirent, neque in\r\nrefectorio comederent, exceptis rarissimis festis, maxime in quibus\r\nHerodem repraesentarent Christi persecutorem, parvulorum interfectorem,\r\nseu ludis aliis aut spectaculis quasi theatralibus exhibendis\r\ncomportaretur symbolum ad faciendum convivium in refectorio aliis pene\r\nomnibus temporibus vacuo.’\r\n\r\n[329] Gerhohus, _de Inv. Ant._ lib. i. c. 5, _de spectaculis theatricis\r\nin ecclesia Dei exhibitis_ (_Gerhohi Opera Inedita_, ed. Scheibelberger,\r\ni. 25) ‘Et sacerdotes, qui dicuntur, iam non ecclesiae vel altaris\r\nministerio dediti sunt, sed exercitiis avaritiae, vanitatum et\r\nspectaculorum, adeo ut ecclesias ipsas, videlicet orationum domus,\r\nin theatra commutent ac mimicis ludorum spectaculis impleant. Inter\r\nquae nimirum spectacula adstantibus ac spectantibus ipsorum feminis\r\ninterdum et antichristi, de quo nobis sermo est, non ut ipsi aestimant\r\nimaginariam similitudinem exhibent sed in veritate, ut credi potest\r\niniquitatis ipsius mysterium pro parte sua implent. Quidni enim diabolus\r\nabutatur in serium rebus sibi exhibitis in vanitatis ludicrum, sicut\r\nDominus quoque Iesus convertens in seria ludibria, quibus apud Iudaeos\r\nvel Pilatum in passione sua affectus est?... Quid ergo mirum si et isti\r\nnunc antichristum vel Herodem in suis ludis simulantes eosdem non, ut\r\neis intentioni est, ludicro mentiuntur sed in veritate exhibent, utpote\r\nquorum vita ab antichristi laxa conversatione non longe abest?...\r\nContigit, ut comperimus, aliquando apud tales, ut eum quem inter ludicra\r\nsua quasi mortuum ab Elisaeo propheta suscitantem exhiberent peracta\r\nsimulatione mortuum invenirent. Alius item antichristo suo quasi\r\nsuscitandus oblatus intra septem dies vere mortuus, ut comperimus, et\r\nsepultus est. Et quis scire potest an et cetera simulata antichristi\r\nscilicet effigiem, daemonum larvas, herodianam insaniem in veritate non\r\nexhibeant?... Exhibent praeterea imaginaliter et salvatoris infantiae\r\ncunabula, parvuli vagitum, puerperae virginis matronalem habitum, stellae\r\nquasi sidus flammigerum, infantum necem, maternum Rachelis ploratum.\r\nSed divinitas insuper et matura facies ecclesiae abhorret spectacula\r\ntheatralia, non respicit in vanitates et insanias falsas, immo non falsas\r\nsed iam veras insanias, in quibus viri totos se frangunt in feminas quasi\r\npudeat eos, quod viri sunt, clerici in milites, homines se in daemonum\r\nlarvas transfigurant....’\r\n\r\n[330] Prynne, _Histriomastix_, 556, refers to ‘the visible apparition\r\nof the Devill on the Stage at the Belsavage Play-house, in Queene\r\nElizabeth’s dayes (to the great amazement both of the Actors and\r\nSpectators) whiles they were there prophanely playing the History of\r\nFaustus (the truth of which I have heard from many now alive, who well\r\nremember it), there being some distracted with that fearefull sight.’\r\n\r\n[331] Pollard, xxiv. I do not know how Ward, i. 43, gets at the very\r\ndifferent theory that in 1210 (_sic_ for 1207) Innocent III ordered plays\r\n‘to be represented outside the church as well as inside.’ Mr. Pollard, by\r\nthe way, assigns the prohibition to ‘Pope Gregory,’ a further mistake,\r\ndue, I suppose, to the fact that it was subsequently included in the\r\nGregorian _Decretals_.\r\n\r\n[332] Cf. vol. i. p. 279.\r\n\r\n[333] Quoted by Creizenach, i. 101, ‘Non tamen hic prohibetur\r\nrepraesentare praesepe Domini, Herodem, magos et qualiter Rachel ploravit\r\nfilios suos, etc., quae tangunt festivitates illas, de quibus hic fit\r\nmentio, cum talia ad devotionem potius inducant homines quam ad lasciviam\r\nvel voluptatem, sicut in pascha sepulcrum Domini et alia repraesentantur\r\nad devotionem excitandam’: cf. vol i. p. 342. J. Aquila, _Opusculum\r\nEnchiridion appellatum ferme de omni ludorum genere_, f. 14 (Oppenheim,\r\n1516), after referring to the canon, says, ‘Demonstrationes quae fiunt\r\nad honorem dei puta passionis Christi aut vitae alicuius sancti non\r\nprohibentur in sacris locis ac temporibus fieri.’ Both canon and gloss\r\nare cited in _Dives and Pauper_, a book of fifteenth-century English\r\nmorality (F.

The performance, which was possibly a\r\ndumb show, took place at a banquet on Jan. 24, 1417/8, and was repeated\r\non the following Sunday before the emperor, who had arrived in the\r\ninterval. Hardt quotes the German of one Dacher, an eye-witness: ‘Am\r\n24ᵗᵉⁿ tag des Monats Januarii, das war auff Timotheus tag, da luden die\r\nBischöff aus Engeland, der Bischoff Salisburgensis, der Bischoff von\r\nLonden, und demnach funff Bischoff von Engeland, alle Räht zu Costniz\r\nund sonst viel ehrbar Bürger daselbst, in Burchart Walters Haus, das man\r\nvorzeiten nennt zu dem Burgthor, itzt zu dem gulden Schvvert, allernächst\r\nbey S. Laurenz. Und gab ihnen fast ein köstlich mahl, ie 2. Gericht nach\r\neinander, jedes Gericht besonder mit 8 Essen: Die trug man allvveg eins\r\nmahl dar, deren allvveg waren 4 verguld oder versilbert. In dem mahl,\r\nzvvischen dem Essen, so machten sie solch bild und geberd, als unser\r\nFrau ihr Kind unsern Herrn und auch Gott gebahr, mit fast köstlichen\r\nTüchern und Gevvand. Und Joseph stellten sie zu ihr. Und die heiligen\r\n3 Könige, als die unser Frauen die Opffer brachten. Und hatten gemacht\r\neinen lauteren guldnen Stern, der ging vor ihnen, an einem kleinen eisern\r\nDrat. Und machten König Herodem, vvie er den drey Königen nachsandt, und\r\nvvie er die Kindlein ertodtet. Das machten sie alles mit gar köstlichem\r\nGevvand, und mit grossen guldenen und silbernen Gürteln, und machten das\r\nmit grosser Gezierd, und mit grosser Demuht.’\r\n\r\n[338] The provincial _C. of Sens_ (1460), c. 3 (Labbé, xiii. 1728),\r\nwhile confirming the Basle decree, allowed ‘aliquid iuxta consuetudines\r\necclesiae, in Nativitate Domini, vel Resurrectione ... fiat cum honestate\r\net pace, absque prolongatione, impedimento, vel diminutione servitii,\r\nlarvatione et sordidatione faciei’; cf. the Toledo decree of 1473 quoted\r\nvol. i. p. 342. The _C. of Compostella_ (1565), c.c. 9-11 (Aguirra _Conc.\r\nHispan._ v. 450, 460), forbade ‘actus sive repraesentationes’ during\r\nservice in church; they might take place with leave of the bishop,\r\nor in his absence the chapter, before or after service. Devotional\r\n‘actus’ were allowed in Passion week on similar conditions. The\r\nCorpus Christi procession ‘semel tantum subsistat, causa horum actuum\r\nvel representationum in eo loco extra ecclesiam quem Praelatus aut\r\n[capitulum] idoneum iudicabit.’ On the other hand the _C. of Seville_\r\n(1512), c. 21 (Aguirra, v. 370), had forbidden priests or monks to\r\nperform or give a ‘locus’ for such ‘actus’: ‘Sumus informati, quod in\r\nquibusdam Ecclesiis nostri Archiepiscopatus et Provinciae permittitur\r\nfieri nonnullas repraesentationes Passionis Domini nostri Iesu Christi,\r\net alios actus, et memoriam Resurrectionis, Nativitatis Salvatoris\r\nnostri, vel alias repraesentationes. Et quia ex talibus actibus orta\r\nsunt, et oriuntur plura absurda, et saepe saepius scandala in cordibus\r\nillorum qui non sunt bene confirmati in nostra sancta fide Catholica,\r\nvidentes confusiones, et excessus, qui in hoc committuntur....’ Cf. also\r\nthe Langres licence of 1408 (p. 97).\r\n\r\n[339] Text in _Reliquiae Antiquae_, ii. 42; Hazlitt, 73; from late\r\nfourteenth-century volume of homilies formerly in library of St.\r\nMartin’s-in-the-Fields.

Kamann, in _Anglia_, x.\r\n189; A. Hohlfeld, in _Anglia_, xi. 285. Much still remains to be done,\r\nespecially for the Chester plays and the _Ludus Coventriae_. The chief\r\nearlier sources are probably the _Evangelium Pseudo-Matthaei_ and the\r\n_Evangelium Nicodemi_ (including the _Gesta Pilati_ and the _Descensus\r\nChristi ad Inferos_), both in Tischendorf, _Evangelia Apocrypha_, and the\r\n_Transitus Mariae_ in Tischendorf, _Apocalypses Apocryphae_. The later\r\nsources include the _Legenda Aurea_ of Jacobus de Voragine (†1275) and\r\nthe _Cursor Mundi_ (ed. R. Morris for E. E. T. S.), a Northumbrian poem\r\nof the early fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n[379] Cf. p. 63.\r\n\r\n[380] Cf. the _Mors Pilati_ in Tischendorf, _Evang. Apocr._ 456.\r\n\r\n[381] The ‘Holy Rood’ episodes are those numbered 6, 13, 14, 16-20, 61\r\nin the table. The fullest accounts of the legend in its varied literary\r\nforms are given by W. Meyer, _Die Geschichte des Kreuzholzes vor\r\nChristus_ (_Abhandlungen der k. bayer. Akad. der Wiss._ I. Cl. xvi. 2.\r\n103, Munich, 1881), and A. S. Napier, _History of the Holy Rood-tree_ (E.\r\nE. T. S. 1894). Roughly, the story is as follows: Seth went to Paradise\r\nto fetch the oil of mercy. An angel gave him three pips from the tree of\r\nknowledge. These were laid beneath the tongue of Adam at his burial, and\r\nthree rods, signifying the Trinity, sprang up. Moses cut the rods, and\r\ndid miracles with them. At his death they were planted in Mount Tabor.\r\nAn angel in a dream sent David to fetch them. They grew into one tree,\r\nin the shade of which David repented of his sin with Bathsheba. When the\r\nTemple was building, a beam was fashioned from the tree, but it would\r\nnot fit and was placed in the Temple for veneration. The woman Maximilla\r\nincautiously sat upon it and her clothes caught fire. She prophesied of\r\nChrist, and the Jews made her the first martyr. The beam was cast into\r\nthe pool of Siloam, to which it gave miraculous properties, and was\r\nfinally made into a bridge. At the Passion, a portion of it was taken for\r\nthe Rood.\r\n\r\n[382] The Norwich play of the Fall is extant in two sixteenth-century\r\nversions.\r\n\r\n[383] The Newcastle play of the Building of the Ark is extant.\r\n\r\n[384] Two Coventry plays are extant, the Shearmen and Taylors’ play,\r\nextending from the Annunciation to the Massacre of the Innocents, and the\r\nWeavers’ play of the Purification and Christ in the Temple.\r\n\r\n[385] Probably these smaller plays, chiefly Paschal, were in English. The\r\nNativity and Resurrection plays in Lord Northumberland’s chapel and the\r\nResurrection play in Magdalen College chapel may have been in Latin (cf.\r\np. 107).\r\n\r\n[386] ‘Thobie’ is included in the French collection of mysteries known as\r\nthe _Viel Testament_ (Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 354, 370).\r\n\r\n[387] On the way in which the later local miracle-play and the scriptural\r\ninterlude merge into each other, cf. p. 191.\r\n\r\n[388] The Destruction of Jerusalem, together with the Visit of Veronica\r\nto Tiberius and the Death of Pilate, which are scenes in the Cornish\r\ncycle, forms the subject-matter of a French _Vengeance de Nostre\r\nSeigneur_, printed in 1491. Another _Vengeance de Nostre Seigneur_ is\r\nattached to the Passion of Eustache Mercadé (†1414). A representation of\r\na Vengeance, following close on one of a Passion, is recorded at Metz in\r\n1437, and there are several later examples (Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii.\r\n12, 175, 415, 451).\r\n\r\n[389] Cf. p. 61.\r\n\r\n[390] Cf. p. 97.\r\n\r\n[391] Cf. vol. i. p. 221.\r\n\r\n[392] Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 574.\r\n\r\n[393] Archdeacon Rogers thus describes the Chester plays (_Digby Plays_,\r\nxix) ‘They first beganne at yᵉ Abbaye gates; & when the firste pagiente\r\nwas played at yᵉ Abbaye gates, then it was wheeled from thence to the\r\npentice at yᵉ highe crosse before yᵉ Mayor; and before that was donne,\r\nthe seconde came, and yᵉ firste wente in-to the water-gate streete, and\r\nfrom thence vnto yᵉ Bridge-streete, and soe all, one after an other, tell\r\nall yᵉ pagiantes weare played.’\r\n\r\n[394] Cf. pp. 95, 160.\r\n\r\n[395] D’Ancona, i. 228.\r\n\r\n[396] Cf. p. 83.\r\n\r\n[397] Cf. p. 83.\r\n\r\n[398] _C.

MS._ 264, ff. 54ᵇ,\r\n76ᵃ.\r\n\r\n[401] The directions to the Coventry Weavers’ play refer to the ‘for\r\npagand’ and the ‘upper part’; those of the Grocers’ play at Norwich to\r\nthe ‘nether parte of yᵉ pageant.’ For the purposes of the dramas these\r\nare distinct localities.\r\n\r\n[402] Cf. p. 86. The Digby St. Mary Magdalen play has the stage\r\ndirection, ‘a stage, and Helle ondyr-neth that stage.’ At Coventry the\r\nCappers had a ‘hell-mouth’ for the Harrowing of Hell and the Weavers\r\nanother for Doomsday.\r\n\r\n[403] Every conceivable spelling of the word ‘pageant’ appears in\r\nthe records. The _Promptorium Parvulorum_, ii. 377 (†1440, ed. A.\r\nWay for Camd. Soc.), has ‘Pagent, _Pagina_,’ and this is the usual\r\nLatin spelling, although _pagenda_ and _pagentes_ (acc. pl.) occur at\r\nBeverley. The derivation is from _pagina_ ‘a plank.’ The _Catholicon\r\nAnglicum_ (1483, ed. S. J. H. Herrtage for E. E. T. S.) has ‘A Paiande;\r\n_lusorium_,’ and there can be little doubt that ‘playing-place,’ ‘stage’\r\nis the primary sense of the word, although as a matter of fact the\r\nderivative sense of ‘scene’ or ‘episode’ is the first to appear. Wyclif\r\nso uses it, speaking of Christmas in his _Ave Maria_ (_English Works_,\r\nE. E. T. S. 206) ‘he that kan best pleie a pagyn of the deuyl, syngynge\r\nsongis of lecherie, of batailis and of lesyngis ... is holden most merie\r\nmon.’ In _Of Prelates_ (_loc. cit._ 99) he says that false teachers\r\n‘comen in viserid deuelis’ and ‘pleien the pagyn of scottis,’ masking\r\nunder St. George’s ‘skochen.’ The elaborate pageants used in masks and\r\nreceptions (cf. p. 176, and vol. i. p. 398) led to a further derivative\r\nsense of ‘mechanical device.’ This, as well as the others, is illustrated\r\nin the passages quoted by the editors of the _Prompt. Parv._ and the\r\n_Cath. Angl._ from W. Horman, author of _Vulgaria_ (1519) ‘Alexander\r\nplayed a payante more worthy to be wondred vpon for his rasshe aduenture\r\nthan for his manhede.... There were v coursis in the feest and as many\r\npaiantis in the pley. I wyll haue made v stagȝ or bouthis in this playe\r\n(_scenas_). I wolde haue a place in the middyl of the pley (_orchestra_)\r\nthat I myght se euery paiaunt. Of all the crafty and subtyle paiantis\r\nand pecis of warke made by mannys wyt, to go or moue by them selfe, the\r\nclocke is one of the beste.’ Synonyms for ‘pageant’ in the sense of\r\n‘stage’ are ‘cariadge’ (Chester) and ‘karre’ (Beverley); in the sense of\r\n‘scene,’ _iocus_ (Coventry), _visus_ (Lincoln), _processus_ or ‘processe’\r\n(Towneley and Digby plays, Croxton _Sacrament_ and Medwall’s morality of\r\n_Nature_).\r\n\r\n[404] Cf. p. 90, and _Hamlet_, iii. 2. 9 ‘O, it offends me to the soul to\r\nhear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very\r\nrags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are\r\ncapable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise: I would have\r\nsuch a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod.’ The\r\nMiller in _Cant. Tales_, 3124, cries out ‘in Pilates vois.’ The torturers\r\nalso seem to have been favourite performers; cf. the _Poem on the Evil\r\nTimes of Edward II_ (T. Wright, _Political Songs_, C. S. 336):\r\n\r\n  ‘Hii ben degised as turmentours that comen from clerkes plei.’\r\n\r\n[405] Cf. p. 48.\r\n\r\n[406] In Jean Fouquet’s miniature representing the French mystery of St.\r\nApollonia (cf. p. 85) a priest, with a book in one hand and a wand in the\r\nother, appears to be conducting the play.\r\n\r\n[407] Cf. p. 203.\r\n\r\n[408] _Hen. V_, ii. 3. 42 ‘Do you not remember, a’ saw a flea stick upon\r\nBardolph’s nose, and a’ said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire?’\r\n\r\n[409] _Hamlet_, v. 1. 85 ‘Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder.’\r\n\r\n[410] Warton, ii. 223 ‘In these Mysteries I have sometimes seen gross\r\nand open obscenities. In a play of _The Old and New Testament_, Adam and\r\nEve are both exhibited on the stage naked, and conversing about their\r\nnakedness: this very pertinently introduces the next scene, in which they\r\nhave coverings of fig-leaves. This extraordinary spectacle was beheld\r\nby a numerous assembly of both sexes with great composure: they had the\r\nauthority of scripture for such a representation, and they gave matters\r\njust as they found them in the third chapter of Genesis. It would have\r\nbeen absolute heresy to have departed from the sacred text in personating\r\nthe primitive appearance of our first parents, whom the spectators so\r\nnearly resembled in simplicity.’\r\n\r\n[411] Deimling, i. 30 ‘Statim nudi sunt ... Tunc Adam et Eva cooperiant\r\ngenitalia sua cum foliis.’\r\n\r\n[412] Cf. vol. i. p. 5.\r\n\r\n[413] Cf. p. 103. So the ‘ordinary’ or prompter (p. 140) is the man in\r\ncharge of the _ordinale_.\r\n\r\n[414] ‘Oreginale de S. Maria Magdalena’ (_Digby MS_.); ‘originall booke,’\r\n‘regenall,’ ‘rygynall,’ ‘orraginall’ (Chester); ‘orygynall,’ ‘rygenale’\r\n(Coventry); ‘regenell’ (Louth); ‘ryginall’ (Sleaford).\r\n\r\n[415] Cf. p. 90.\r\n\r\n[416] As the price paid was only ‘iiijᵈ’ a _printed_ play was probably\r\nbought, from which the ‘partes,’ at a cost of ‘ijˢ,’ were written; cf. p.\r\n192.\r\n\r\n[417] Ritson, _Bibl. Poet._ 79, included in his list of Lydgate’s works a\r\n‘Procession of pageants from the creation’ which has not been identified.\r\nOn the ‘Procession of Corpus Christi,’ which follows in the list, cf. p.\r\n161.\r\n\r\n[418] Ten Brink, ii. 235 ‘An incessant process of separating and uniting,\r\nof extending and curtailing, marks the history of the liturgical drama,\r\nand indeed of the mediaeval drama generally.’\r\n\r\n[419] _Towneley Plays_ (E. E. T. S.), xiv.\r\n\r\n[420] _Anglia_, xi. 253.\r\n\r\n[421] Davidson, 252.\r\n\r\n[422] Cf. p. 69.\r\n\r\n[423] Thus at York, the Corpus Christi procession which the plays were\r\noriginally designed to magnify, had become by 1426 a hindrance to them;\r\ncf. p. 139.\r\n\r\n[424] There is but little of direct merging of the plays with\r\nfolk-customs. At Aberdeen the ‘Haliblude’ play was under the local lord\r\nof misrule. At Norwich the play was on Whit-Monday; the lord of misrule\r\nheld revel on Whit-Tuesday. At Reading there were plays on May-day. At\r\nChelmsford and Wymondham they were attached to the Midsummer ‘watch’ or\r\n‘show.’ Typically ‘folk’ personages, the ‘wodmen’ (cf. vol. i. p. 185),\r\nappear in the Aberdeen Candlemas procession, and at Hull the ‘hobby-ship’\r\n(cf. vol. i. p. 121) becomes the centre of a play.\r\n\r\n[425] Richard Carew lays stress on the delight taken by the spectators in\r\nthe devils of the Cornish plays. Collier, ii. 187, quotes a jest about\r\nthe devil in a Suffolk stage-play from _C. Mery Talys_ (†1533). In the\r\n_Conversion of St. Paul_ of the Digby MS., a later hand has carefully\r\ninserted a devil scene. On the whole subject of the representation of\r\ndevils in the plays, cf. Cushman, 16; Eckhardt, 53.\r\n\r\n[426] _York Plays_, 524.\r\n\r\n[427] Ed. Groeneveld (1888); cf. Creizenach, i. 362; Julleville, _Les\r\nMyst._ i. 180, ii. 342.\r\n\r\n[428] I do not think that these Dutch plays have been printed. The\r\nMS., in the Royal Library at Brussels, is described by Hoffmann von\r\nFallersleben, _Horae Belgicae_, vi, xxix; cf. Creizenach, i. 366. Besides\r\nthe three chivalric plays, it contains a dramatized _estrif_ of Summer\r\nand Winter (cf. vol. i. p. 187) included with them under the general\r\ntitle of ‘abele Spelen,’ and also a long farce or ‘Boerd.’ To each of the\r\nfive plays, moreover, is attached a short farcical after-piece. A few\r\nnotices of other fifteenth-century Dutch chivalric plays are preserved.\r\nThe subjects are Arnoute, Ronchevale, Florys und Blancheflor, Gryselle\r\n(Griseldis); cf. Creizenach, i. 372.\r\n\r\n[429] Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 284, 310.\r\n\r\n[430] Ed. F. Guessard et E. de Certain (1862) in _Collection des\r\ndocuments historiques_; cf. Creizenach, i. 372; Julleville, _Les Myst._\r\nii. 576; H. Tivier, _Étude sur le Myst. du Siège d’O._ (1868). The play\r\nmay have been designed for performance at the festival held at Orleans\r\nin memory of the siege on May 8. The passage quoted from Sir Richard\r\nMorrison on p. 221, suggests that a similar commemoration was held in the\r\nsixteenth century by the English at Calais of the battle of Agincourt in\r\n1415.\r\n\r\n[431] Ed. Stengel (1883); cf. Creizenach, i. 374; Julleville, _Les Myst._\r\nii. 569.\r\n\r\n[432] Cf. _Representations_, s.v. Dublin.\r\n\r\n[433] Collier, ii. 183, thinks the term ‘morality’ a ‘recent’ one, but it\r\nwas used in 1503: cf. p. 201.\r\n\r\n[434] There is not much direct imitation of the _Roman de la Rose_ in the\r\nmoralities. Perhaps the French _Honneur des Dames_ of Andrieu de la Vigne\r\n(Julleville, _Rép. com._ 73) comes nearest. But its leading episode, the\r\nsiege of the fortress of Danger, is reflected in the siege of the Castle\r\nof Perseverance and that of the Castle of Maudleyn in the _Mary Magdalen_\r\nof the Digby MS. On the general place of allegory in contemporary\r\nliterature cf. Courthope, i. 341.\r\n\r\n[435] Cf. pp. 63, 77.\r\n\r\n[436] Ward, i. 105; _Archaeologia_, xiii. 232. A _débat_ on precisely\r\nthis theme is introduced into the _Chasteau d’Amour_, a theological work\r\nin the form of a romance, ascribed to Robert Grosseteste (1175-1253), on\r\nwhich cf. F. S. Stevenson, _Life of Grosseteste_, 38; Jusserand, _Eng.\r\nLit._ i. 214. In the English version of the fourteenth century (R. F.\r\nWeymouth, _The Castel of Love_, 273) the passage begins—\r\n\r\n  ‘For now I chul tellen of þe stryf\r\n  Þat a-mong þe foure sustren liþ.’\r\n\r\n[437] No stress is of course to be laid upon the late introduction of\r\nDolor and Myserye into the Grocers’ play at Norwich, when the text was\r\nrewritten in 1565.\r\n\r\n[438] _Ludus Cov._ 106 (play xi, _Virtutes_), 70, 79, 89, 105, 124, 129,\r\n289 (plays viii-xiii, xxix, _Contemplacio_), 184 (play xix, _Mors_), 386\r\n(play xli, _Sapientia_); cf.

The earliest\r\nFrench notice is that of the ‘Gieux des sept vertuz et des sept pechiez\r\nmortelz’ at Tours in 1390. A ‘mystère de Bien-Avisé et Malavisé’ is said\r\nto have been played in 1396 (Julleville, _Rép. com._ 324). The extant\r\nplay of that name, somewhat later in date, is a morality. Other early\r\nFrench morals on a large scale are _L’Homme juste et l’Homme mondain_\r\n(1508) and _L’Homme pécheur_ (†1494) (Julleville, _Rép. com._ 39, 67,\r\n72). All these are on variants of the Contrast of Vice and Virtue theme.\r\n\r\n[443] Creizenach, i. 465, quoting a thirteenth-century German sermon.\r\n\r\n[444] Cf. p. 201 and _Texts_ (ii).

O exceeding puppet! Now will he interpret\r\nto her.’\r\n\r\n[461] Morley, 179, 187, 190, 247, 261, 273, 304, 321, records ‘Patient\r\nGrisel’ (1655, 1677), ‘Susanna’ (1655), ‘Sodom and Gomorrah’ (1656),\r\n‘Judith and Holophernes’ (1664), ‘Jephtha’s Rash Vow’ (1697, 1698, 1701,\r\n1704, 1733), ‘The Creation of the World’ (1701).\r\n\r\n[462] Powell’s performances of the ‘Creation of the World’ at Bath and\r\n‘Susanna’ at Covent Garden are referred to in the _Tatler_ for May 14,\r\n1709, and the _Spectator_ for March 16, 1711.\r\n\r\n[463] Hone, 230, describes a ‘gallantee show’ of the Prodigal Son and\r\nof Noah’s Ark with a scene of ‘Pull Devil, Pull Baker,’ showing the\r\njudgement upon a baker who gave short weight (cf. the cut in Morley,\r\n356), seen by him in London in 1818. This was an exhibition of _ombres\r\nchinoises_ rather than a puppet-play proper.\r\n\r\n[464] A. Dieterich, _Pulcinella_, 234, considers Pulcinella a descendant\r\nof Maccus, derives the name from _pullicenus_, _pulcinus_, _pullus_,\r\nand connects the fowl-masks of Italian comedy with the cockscomb of the\r\nEnglish fool (cf. vol. i. p. 385).\r\n\r\n[465] Collier, _Punch and Judy_ (1870), 11 sqq.; Frost, _The Old Showmen\r\nand the Old London Fairs_, 29. The earliest English notice of Punch in\r\nEngland is in the overseers’ books of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields for 1666\r\nand 1667, ‘Recᵈ of Punchinello, yᵉ Italian popet player, for his booth at\r\nCharing Cross.’ In a Bartholomew Fair playbill of the early eighteenth\r\ncentury, ‘the merry conceits of Squire Punch and Sir John Spendall’ were\r\nattached to the puppet-show of the Creation of the World. Punch was\r\nalso amongst the _dramatis personae_ of Robert Powell. The nature of\r\nthese earlier Punch plays is unknown. That now traditional in England is\r\nimplied by the ballad of _Punch’s Pranks_ (†1790). Collier, who prints it\r\nas given by one Piccini in Drury Lane, with cuts by Cruikshank, considers\r\nit to be derived from _Don Juan_. But it seems to me to come still nearer\r\nto the morality plays. French Punch plays have many other themes.\r\n\r\n[466] Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 208; cf. p. 95.\r\n\r\n[467] Printed by Halliwell, _Minor Poems of Lydgate_ (Percy Soc.),\r\n95, from Shirley’s _Harl._ 2251, f. 293, as a _Processioune of Corpus\r\nCristi_, with a note at the end that ‘Shirley kowde fynde no more.’ It\r\nis also, with the same note, in Shirley’s _Trin. Coll. Camb. MS._ R. 3.\r\n20, f. 348, with the heading, ‘Ordenaunce of a p’cessyoun of the feste of\r\nCorpus Cristi, made in London by Daun John Lydegate’ (E. P. Hammond, in\r\n_Anglia_, xxii. 364), and is copied thence by John Stowe in _B. M. Add.\r\nMS._ 29, 729, f. 166. The piece is nᵒ. 153 in the list of Lydgate’s works\r\ngiven by Ritson, _Bibl. Poet._ 79. It may be doubted whether Ritson’s\r\nnᵒ. 152 ‘A Procession of pageants from the creation’ is really distinct.\r\nLydgate describes to his hearers ‘figures shewed in your presence’ which\r\nembody ‘gracious mysteries grounded in Scripture.’ Of course ‘mysteries’\r\nhas no technical dramatic sense here. Lydgate’s method of ‘interpreting’\r\nmay have been based on the incorrect mediaeval notion of the methods of\r\nthe classical stage, which he adopts in his _Troy Book_ (cf. p. 208). The\r\n‘figures’ represented twenty-seven persons whose utterances revealed the\r\nmystery of the Mass. There were eight patriarchs, the Ecclesiast, four\r\nprophets, the Baptist, four evangelists, St. Paul, and seven Christian\r\ndoctors.\r\n\r\n[468] Sharp, 172, quotes from a contemporary writer a passage showing\r\nthat the Dublin procession, like those of Coventry and Shrewsbury,\r\nlasted to a recent date: ‘The Fringes was a procession of the trades and\r\ncorporations, performed in Ireland on Corpus Christi day, even within the\r\nauthor’s recollection. King Solomon, Queen of Sheba, with Vulcan, Venus,\r\nand Cupid, were leading persons upon this occasion.’\r\n\r\n[469] Julleville, _Les Myst._ ii. 211; Davidson, 219.\r\n\r\n[470] The following is from an account of a continental Corpus Christi\r\nprocession in Barnabe Googe’s translation of Naogeorgos’ _Popish Kingdom_\r\n(1553), iv. 699 (Stubbes, i. 337):\r\n\r\n  ‘Christes passion here derided is, with sundrie maskes and playes;\r\n  Faire Ursley with hir maydens all, doth passe amid the wayes:\r\n  And valiant George, with speare thou killest the dreadfull dragon here;\r\n  The deuil’s house is drawne about, wherein there doth appere\r\n  A wondrous sort of damned sprites, with foule and fearefull looke;\r\n  Great Christopher doth wade and passe with Christ amid the brooke:\r\n  Sebastian full of feathred shaftes, the dint of dart doth feele;\r\n  There walketh Kathren with hir sworde in hande, and cruell wheele:\r\n  The Challis and the singing Cake, with Barbara is led,\r\n  And sundrie other Pageants playde in worship of this bred, &c.’\r\n\r\n[471] Sharp, 217, records a play of the _Golden Fleece_ provided by\r\nRobert Crowe for the Cappers’ Candlemas Dinner in 1525; the London\r\ndrapers had a pageant with the same title in 1522 (cf. p. 165).\r\n\r\n[472] Cf. the Paradise show at the London reception of Henry VI in 1432\r\n(p. 170).\r\n\r\n[473] Toulmin Smith, _English Guilds_, 149.\r\n\r\n[474] Ibid. 148.\r\n\r\n[475] Ibid. 30.\r\n\r\n[476] Kelly, 7, 11.\r\n\r\n[477] Cf. _Representations_, s.v.

S. Alb._, i.e. probably Thomas Walsingham (†1422), not Matthew\r\nParis (†1249). The reading is doubtful in Anastasius Bibliothecarius\r\n(9th cent.), _Hist. Pontif._ (_P. L._ lxxx. 1352), ‘quem iussit sibi\r\npraesentari in interludo noctu ante templum Palladis.’\r\n\r\n[529] For probable 1385 cases, cf. _Representations_, s.v.

These performances were known as _les\r\npois pilés_ and began about the middle of the fourteenth century. The\r\nAnglo-French _entrelude_, asterisked by the _N. E. D._, is found in 1427\r\n(cf. p. 186). Collier’s theory receives some support from the Spanish\r\nuse of the term _entremes_ for a comic piece played in conjunction with\r\na serious _auto_. But the earlier sense of _entremes_ itself appears to\r\nbe for an independent farce played at banquets (Ticknor, _Hist. of Span.\r\nLit._ (ed. 1888), i. 231; ii. 449).\r\n\r\n[532] Cf. the accounts in Leland, _Collectanea_, iv. 228, 236, of the\r\ncourt of Henry VII. Douglas, _Palace of Honour_, ii. 410 ‘At eis they eit\r\nwith interludis betwene,’ dates from 1501. Horman, _Vulgaria_ (1519),\r\nquoted on p. 137, speaks of the ‘paiantis’ of a play as corresponding in\r\nnumber to the courses of a feast. Much earlier Raoul de Presles (†1374)\r\nin his _Exposicion_ to Augustine, _de Civ. Dei_, ii. 8 (Abbeville, 1486),\r\nsays that comedies ‘sont proprement apellez interludia, pour ce quilz se\r\nfont entre les deux mengiers.’ But the use of _interludere_ by Ausonius,\r\n_Idyll_, x. 76, ‘interludentes, examina lubrica, pisces,’ and Ambrose,\r\n_Epist._ xlvii. 4, ‘interludamus epistolis,’ supports my view.\r\n\r\n[533] For a curious distinction, probably neither original nor permanent,\r\ndrawn about 1530 between ‘stage playes’ (presumably out of doors) in\r\nthe summer and ‘interludes’ (presumably indoors) in the winter, cf.\r\nthe documents printed by H. R. Plomer, in _Trans. of Bibliographical\r\nSociety_, iv. (1898), 153, and A. W. Pollard in _Fifteenth Century Prose\r\nand Verse_, 305, about a suit between John Rastell, lawyer, printer,\r\nand playwright, and one Henry Walton. Rastell, going on a visit to\r\nFrance about 1525, had left with Walton a number of players’ garments.\r\nThese are fully described. They were mostly of say or sarcenet, and the\r\ntailor, who with the help of Rastell’s wife had made them, valued them\r\nat 20_s._ apiece. Walton failed to restore them, and for some years\r\nlet them on hire, to his own profit. Evidence to this effect was given\r\nby John Redman, stationer, and by George Mayler, merchant tailor, and\r\nGeorge Birche, coriar, two of the king’s players. These men had played\r\nin the garments themselves and had seen them used in ‘stage pleyes’\r\nwhen the king’s banquet was at Greenwich [in 1527; cf. vol. i. p. 400].\r\nThey had been used at least twenty times in stage plays every summer\r\nand twenty times in interludes every winter, and Walton had taken, as\r\nthe ‘common custume’ was, at a stage play ‘sumtyme xlᵈ., sometyme ijˢ.,\r\nas they couth agree, and at an interlude viijᵈ for every tyme.’ Rastell\r\nhad brought a previous suit in the mayor’s court, but could only receive\r\n35_s._ 9_d._, at which the goods had been officially appraised. But they\r\nwere then ‘rotten and torne,’ whereas Rastell alleged that they were\r\nnearly new when delivered to Walton and worth 20 marks. Walton relied on\r\nthe official appraisement, and had a counter-claim for 40_s._ balance\r\nof a bill for 50_s._ costs ‘in making of stage for player in Restall’s\r\ngrounde beside Fyndesbury, in tymbre, bourde, nayle, lath, sprigge and\r\nother thyngs.’ He held the clothes against payment of this amount, which\r\nRastell challenged.\r\n\r\n[534] In 1503 a _Magi_ was given in Canterbury guildhall. Some of the\r\ncrafts of Coventry (1478-1568) and Newcastle (1536) had plays at their\r\nguild feasts. The indoor performances of Chester plays in 1567 and 1576\r\nare late and exceptional.\r\n\r\n[535] Cf. Appendix E, ii (Maxstoke), iii (Thetford), vii (Howard), viii\r\n(Tudor Court). ‘Moleyn’s wedding’ attended by Lord Howard, is the first\r\nof many at which the players are recorded to have made the mirth. Some\r\nof the entries may imply visits _to_ the plays, rather than _of_ the\r\nplays, and this I suppose to be the case with Henry VII’s payment ‘to\r\nthe players _at_ Myles End.’ It is perhaps a little arbitrary to assume,\r\nas I have done, that players locally named are never professional. Thus\r\nthe _lusores de Writhill_ paid by the duke of Buckingham on Jan. 6,\r\n1508, are almost certainly identical with the _lusores Dñi de Wrisell_\r\n(his brother-in-law, the earl of Northumberland) paid by him at Xmas,\r\n1507 (_Archaeologia_, xxv. 318, 324), although it happens curiously\r\nenough that the Chelmsford wardrobe was drawn upon by players of Writtle\r\nin 1571-2. The local designation of members of the minstrel class is\r\nexceptional; but cf. the York example in the next note. The locally\r\nnamed _lusores_ may, however, sometimes have acted not a miracle, but a\r\nMay-game or sword-dance; e.g., at Winchester College in 1400 when they\r\ncame ‘cum tripudio suo’ (App. E, iv).\r\n\r\n[536] I have taken _lusores_ in the _computi_ as always meaning\r\nperformers of a dramatic _ludus_. This is often demonstrably correct and\r\nnever demonstrably incorrect, except that when Colet in his _Oratio ad\r\nClerum_ of 1511 quotes the canon ‘ne sit publicus lusor’ he seems to use\r\nthe term in its canonical sense of ‘gambler.’ The English version (1661)\r\nhas ‘common gamer or player.’ A similar ambiguity is, I think, the only\r\none which attaches itself to ‘player’ where it is a technical term after\r\nthe middle of the fourteenth century. Lydgate in his _Interpretacyon of\r\nthe names of Goddys and Goddesses_ (quoted by Collier, i. 31) uses it\r\nof an actor, although an older sense is preserved by the _Promptorium\r\nParvulorum_ (1440), ‘Bordyoure or pleyere, _ioculator_.’ The sense of\r\n_ludentes_, I think, is wide. The _ludentes_ ‘_de Donyngton_’ and ‘_de\r\nWakefield_’ paid by the York corporation in 1446 (_York Plays_, xxxviii)\r\nare more likely to have been minstrels whom the corporation did provide\r\nfor the plays than actors whom they did not. On the other hand about\r\n_interludentes_ and _interlusores_, neither of them very common terms,\r\nthere can be no doubt. _Lusiatores_ occurs as a synonym for _lusores_\r\nat Shrewsbury only. _Mimi_ and _histriones_ I have uniformly treated as\r\nmerely minstrels. At a late date they might, I suppose, be actors, but it\r\nis impossible to differentiate.\r\n\r\n[537] Plays were sometimes read, even in the fifteenth century. The\r\nprologue of _The Burial and Resurrection_ has ‘Rede this treyte,’\r\nalthough it was also converted into ‘a play to be playede’; and the\r\nepilogue of the Digby _St. Mary Magdalen_ has ‘I desyer the redars to\r\nbe my frynd.’ Thomas Wylley in 1537 describes some of his plays to\r\nCromwell as ‘never to be seen, but of your Lordshyp’s eye.’ Prynne,\r\n834, asserts that ‘Bernardinus Ochin his Tragedy of Freewil, Plessie\r\nMorney his Tragedie of Jeptha his daughter, Edward the 6 his Comedie de\r\nmeretrice Babilonica, Iohn Bale his Comedies de Christo et de Lazaro,\r\nSkelton’s Comedies, de Virtute, de Magnificentia, et de bono Ordine,\r\nNicholaus Grimoaldus, de Archiprophetae Tragedia ... were penned only to\r\nbe read, not acted’; but this is incorrect as regards Bale and Skelton\r\nand probably as regards others. The earliest printed plays are perhaps\r\n_Mundus et Infans_ (1522) and _Hickscorner_ (n.d.) both by Wynkyn de\r\nWorde (1501-35), _Everyman_ (n.d.) by Richard Pynson (1509-27). If a\r\n_Nigramansir_, by Skelton, was really, as Warton asserts, printed by\r\nWynkyn de Worde in 1504, it might take precedence.\r\n\r\n[538] Cf. Appendix E.\r\n\r\n[539] 3 _Edw. IV_, c. 5; cf. vol. i. p. 45. This was continued by 1 _Hen.\r\nVIII_, c. 14, 6 _Hen. VIII_, c. 1, and 24 _Hen. VIII_, c. 13.\r\n\r\n[540] Cf. Appendix E; _Hist. MSS._ v. 548.\r\n\r\n[541] Percy, _N. H. B._ 22, 158, 339. An estimate for 1511-12 includes\r\n‘for rewardes to Players for Playes playd in Christynmas by Stranegers\r\nin my house after xxᵈ every play by estimacion. Somme xxxiijˢ iiijᵈ.’\r\nAnother of 1514-15 has ‘for Rewards to Players in Cristynmas lxxijˢ.’ By\r\n1522-3 the customary fee had largely grown, for a list of ‘Al maner of\r\nRewardis’ of about that date has ‘Item. My Lorde usith and accustometh\r\nto gif yerely when his Lordshipp is at home to every Erlis Players that\r\ncomes to his Lordshipe bitwixt Cristynmas ande Candelmas If he be his\r\nˢpeciall Lorde and Frende ande Kynsman, xxˢ ... to every Lordis Players,\r\nxˢ.’\r\n\r\n[542] Leland, _Collectanea_ (ed. Hearne), iv. 265. The _computi_ of\r\nJames IV (_L. H. T. Accts._ ii. 131, 387; iii. 361) contain entries for\r\nplays before him by ‘gysaris’ including one at this wedding; but there\r\nis no evidence of a regular royal company at the Scottish court. In 1488\r\noccurs a payment to ‘Patrik Johnson and the playaris of Lythgow that\r\nplayt to the King,’ and in 1489 one to ‘Patrick Johnson and his fallowis\r\nthat playt a play to the kyng in Lythqow.’ This Johnson or Johnstone,\r\ncelebrated in Dunbar’s _Lament for the Makaris_, seems to have held some\r\npost, possibly as a minstrel, at court (_L. H. T. Accts._ i. c, cxcviii,\r\nccxliv, 91, 118; ii. 131; Dunbar, _Poems_ (ed. S. T. S.), i. ccxxxvii).\r\n\r\n[543] Collier, i. 44 and passim; Henry, _Hist. of Britain_, 454; cf.\r\nAppendix E, viii. The _Transactions of the New Shakspere Soc._ (1877-9),\r\n425, contain papers about a dispute in 1529 between one of the company\r\nGeorge Maller, glazier, and his apprentice, who left him and went\r\ntravelling on his own account. From these it appears that ‘the Kinge’s\r\nplaierz’ wore ‘the Kinge’s bage.’ George Maller is the same player who\r\nappeared as a witness in the Rastell suit (cf. p. 184). There he is\r\ndescribed as a merchant tailor; here as a glazier. That a king’s player\r\nshould have a handicraft, even if it were only nominal, at all, looks\r\nas if the professional actors were not invariably of the minstrel type.\r\nPerhaps the glamour of a royal ‘bage’ made even minstrelsy respectable.\r\nArthur, prince of Wales, had his own company in 1498 (_Black Book of\r\nLincoln’s Inn_, i. 119), and Henry, prince of Wales, his by 1506.\r\n\r\n[544] Medwall’s _Nature_ is divided into two parts, for performance on\r\ndifferent days. But Medwall was a tedious person. Another interlude of\r\nhis played in 1514 was so long and dull that Henry VIII went out before\r\nthe end. _The Four Elements_ was intended to take an hour and a half ‘but\r\nif you list you may leave out much of the said matter ... and then it\r\nwill not be past three quarters of an hour of length.’\r\n\r\n[545] This method begins with the Croxton _Sacrament_, which has twelve\r\nparts, but ‘ix may play it at ease.’ Bale’s _Three Laws_ claims to\r\nrequire five players and _Lusty Juventus_ four. Several of the early\r\nElizabethan interludes have similar indications.\r\n\r\n[546] A Winchester _computus_ of 1579 (Hazlitt-Warton, ii. 234) has\r\n‘pro diversis expensis circa Scaffoldam erigendam et deponendam, et pro\r\ndomunculis de novo compositis cum carriagio et recarriagio ly joystes et\r\naliorum mutuatorum ad eandem Scaffoldam, cum vj linckes et jᵒ duodeno\r\ncandelarum, pro lumine expensis, tribus noctibus in ludis comediarum et\r\ntragediarum xxvˢ viijᵈ.’\r\n\r\n[547] Appendix E (i).\r\n\r\n[548] Brewer, iv. 1390, 1393, 1394; Hall, 723; Collier, i. 98.\r\n\r\n[549] Stowe, _Annals_, 511.\r\n\r\n[550] The miracle-plays and popular morals have a more general prayer for\r\nthe spiritual welfare of the ‘sofereyns,’ ‘lordinges,’ and the rest of\r\ntheir audience.\r\n\r\n[551] Willis, _Mount Tabor_ (1639, quoted Collier, ii. 196), describing\r\nthe morality of _The Castle of Security_ seen by him as a child, says\r\n‘In the city of Gloucester the manner is (as I think it is in other like\r\ncorporations) that when Players of Enterludes come to towne, they first\r\nattend the Mayor, to enforme him what noble-mans servants they are and\r\nso to get licence for their publike playing: and if the Mayor like the\r\nActors, or would show respect to their Lord and Master, he appoints them\r\nto play their first play before himselfe and the Aldermen and Common\r\nCounsell of the City; and that is called the Mayor’s play, where every\r\none that will comes in without money, the Mayor giving the players a\r\nreward as hee thinks fit, to show respect unto them. At such a play,\r\nmy father tooke me with him, and made mee stand betweene his leggs, as\r\nhe sate upon one of the benches, where we saw and heard very well.’ In\r\n_Histriomastix_, a play of 1590-1610 (Simpson, _School of Shakespeare_,\r\nii. 1), a crew of tippling mechanicals call themselves ‘Sir Oliver\r\nOwlet’s men and proclaim at the Cross a play to be given in the townhouse\r\nat 3 o’clock. They afterwards throw the town over to play in the hall\r\nof Lord Mavortius.’ In _Sir Thomas More_ (†1590, ed. A. Dyce, for\r\nShakespeare Society, 1844) ‘my Lord Cardinall’s players,’ four men and a\r\nboy, play in the Chancellor’s hall and receive ten angels. For similar\r\nscenes cf. the _Induction_ to _The Taming of the Shrew_, and _Hamlet_,\r\nii. 2; iii. 2.\r\n\r\n[552] The earliest record of plays at inns which I have noticed is in\r\n1557, when some Protestants were arrested and their minister burnt for\r\nholding a communion service in English on pretence of attending a play at\r\nthe Saracen’s Head, Islington (Foxe, _Acts and Monuments_, ed. Cattley,\r\nviii. 444).\r\n\r\n[553] Eustace Deschamps (†1415), _Miroir de Mariage_ (_Œuvres_, in _Anc.\r\nTextes franç._ vol. ix), 3109 (cf. Julleville, _La Com._ 40):\r\n\r\n  Mais assez d’autres femmes voy,\r\n  Qui vont par tout sanz nul convoy\r\n  Aux festes, aux champs, au theatre,\r\n  Pour soulacier et pour esbatre:\r\n  ...\r\n  Elles desirent les cités,\r\n  Les douls mos a euls recités,\r\n  Festes, marchiés, et le theatre,\r\n  Lieux de delis pour euls esbatre.\r\n\r\nThis theatre was probably one established towards the end of the\r\nfourteenth century by the _confrérie de la Passion_. From about 1402 they\r\nperformed in the _Hôpital de la Trinité_; cf. Julleville, _Les Com._ 61,\r\n_La Com._ 40.\r\n\r\n[554] Cf. vol. i. p. 383.\r\n\r\n[555] _Register of Bishop Grandisson_ (ed. Hingeston-Randolph), ii. 1120.\r\nThe letter, unfortunately too long-winded to quote in full, was written\r\non Aug. 9, 1352, to the archdeacon of Exeter or his official. Grandisson\r\nsays:—‘Sane, licet artes mechanicas, ut rerum experiencia continue nos\r\ninformat, mutuo, necessitate quadam, oporteat se iuvare; pridem, tamen,\r\nintelleximus quod nonnulli nostrae Civitatis Exoniae inprudentes filii,\r\ninordinate lasciviae dediti, fatue contempnentes quae ad ipsorum et\r\nuniversalis populi indigenciam fuerunt utiliter adinventa, quendam\r\nLudum noxium qui culpa non caret, immo verius ludibrium, in contumeliam\r\net opprobrium allutariorum, necnon eorum artificii, hac instanti Die\r\nDominica, in Theatro nostrae Civitatis predictae publice peragere\r\nproponunt, ut inter se statuerunt et intendunt; ex quo, ut didicimus,\r\ninter praefatos artifices et dicti Ludi participes, auctores pariter et\r\nfautores, graves discordiae, rancores, et rixae, cooperante satore tam\r\nexecrabilis irae et invidiae, vehementer pululant et insurgunt.’ The\r\n_ludus_ is to be forbidden under pain of the greater excommunication.\r\nAt the same time the _allutarii_ are to be admonished, since they\r\nthemselves, ‘in mercibus suis distrahendis plus iusto precio, modernis\r\ntemporibus,’ have brought about the trouble, ‘ne exnunc, in vendendo\r\nquae ad eos pertinent, precium per Excellentissimum Principem et Dominum\r\nnostrum, Angliae et Franciae Regemillustrem, et Consilium suum, pro\r\nutilitate publica limitatum, exigant quovis modo.’\r\n\r\n[556] L. G. Bolingbroke, _Pre-Elizabethan Plays and Players in Norfolk_\r\n(_Norfolk Archaeology_, xi. 336). The corporation gave a lease of the\r\n‘game-house’ on condition that it should be available ‘at all such\r\ntimes as any interludes or plays should be ministered or played.’ John\r\nRastell’s 50_s._ stage in Finsbury about 1520-5 (cf. p. 184), although\r\nnot improbably used for public representations, is not known to have been\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\n[557] At Rayleigh, Essex (1550), 20_s._ from the produce of church\r\ngoods was paid to stage-players on Trinity Sunday (_Archaeologia_,\r\nxlii. 287). _An Answer to a Certain Libel_ (1572, quoted Collier, ii.\r\n72) accuses the clergy of hurrying the service, because there is ‘an\r\nenterlude to be played, and if no place else can be gotten, it must be\r\ndoone in the church’; cf. S. Gosson, _Third Blast of Retrait from Plaies\r\nand Theaters_, 1580 (Hazlitt, _E. D. S._ 134) ‘Such like men, vnder\r\nthe title of their maisters or as reteiners, are priuiledged to roaue\r\nabroad, and permitted to publish their mametree in euerie Temple of God,\r\nand that through England, vnto the horrible contempt of praier. So that\r\nnow the Sanctuarie is become a plaiers stage, and a den of theeues and\r\nadulterers.’ Possibly only the publication of the _banns_ of plays in\r\nchurch is here complained of. Cf. also Fuller, _Church History_ (1655),\r\n391.\r\n\r\n[558] Bonner’s _Injunctions_, 17, of April, 1542 (Wilkins, iii. 864),\r\nforbade ‘common plays games or interludes’ in churches or chapels.\r\nViolent enforcers of them were to be reported to the bishop’s officers;\r\ncf. the various injunctions of Elizabethan bishops in _Ritual\r\nCommission_, 409, 411, 417, 424, 436, and the 88th _Canon_ of 1604.\r\n\r\n[559] Kelly, 16 ‘Paid to Lord Morden’s players because they should not\r\nplay in the church, xijᵈ.’\r\n\r\n[560] Jackson-Burne, 493, citing Sir Offley Wakeman in _Shropshire\r\nArchaeological Transactions_, vii. 383. Such plays were performed on\r\nwagons at Shropshire wakes within the last century. The ‘book’ seems\r\nto have been adapted from the literary drama, if one may judge by the\r\nsubjects which included ‘St. George,’ ‘Prince Mucidorus,’ ‘Valentine and\r\nOrson,’ and ‘Dr. Forster’ or ‘Faustus.’ But a part was always found for\r\na Fool in a hareskin cap, with balls at his knees. He is described as a\r\nsort of presenter or chorus, playing ‘all manner of megrims’ and ‘going\r\non with his manœuvres all the time.’ I have not been able to see a paper\r\non _Shropshire Folk-plays_ by J. F. M. Dovaston. G. Borrow, _Wild Wales_,\r\nchh. lix, lx (ed. 1901, p. 393), describes similar Welsh interludes\r\nwhich lasted to the beginning of the nineteenth century. The titles\r\nnamed suggest moralities. He analyses the _Riches and Poverty_ of Thomas\r\nEdwards. This, like the Shropshire interludes, has its ‘fool.’\r\n\r\n[561] Roper, _Life and Death of Sir Thomas More_ (†1577, J. R. Lumby,\r\n_More’s Utopia_, vi) ‘would he at Christmas tyd sodenly sometymes stepp\r\nin among the players, and never studinge for the matter, make a parte\r\nof his owne there presently amonge them’; Erasmus, _Epist._ ccccxlvii\r\n‘adolescens comoediolas et scripsit et egit.’ Bale, _Scriptores_ (1557),\r\ni. 655, ascribes to him comoedias iuveniles. Lib. 1.’ In the play of _Sir\r\nThomas More_ (cf. p. 189) he is represented, even when Chancellor, as\r\nsupplying the place of a missing actor with an improvised speech. Bale,\r\nii. 103, says that Henry Parker, Lord Morley (1476-1556) ‘in Anglica\r\nsermone edidit comoedias et tragoedias, libros plures.’\r\n\r\n[562] The _Revels Account_ for 1511 (Brewer, ii. 1496) notes an interlude\r\nin which ‘Mr. Subdean, now my Lord of Armykan’ took part. In his _Oratio\r\nad Clerum_ of the same year Colet criticizes the clerics who ‘se ludis\r\net iocis tradunt’ (Collier, i. 64). A _Sermo exhortatorius cancellarii\r\nEboracensis his qui ad sacros ordines petunt promoveri_ printed by Wynkyn\r\nde Worde about 1525 also calls attention to the canonical requirement\r\nthat the clergy should abstain ‘a ludis theatralibus’ (Hazlitt, _Bibl.\r\nColl. and Notes_, 3rd series (1887), 274).\r\n\r\n[563] Collier, i. 46 and _passim_; Bernard Andrew, _Annales Hen.

The Chapel formed part of the household of Henry I about 1135\r\n(_Red Book of Exchequer_, R. S. iii. cclxxxvii, 807); for its history cf.\r\n_Household Ordinances_, 10, 17, 35, 49; E. F.

In household lists for 1511 and\r\n1520 comes the entry ‘The Almonar, and if he be a maker of Interludys\r\nthan he to have a Servaunt to the intent for Writynge of the Parts and\r\nells to have non.’ There were nine gentlemen and six children of the\r\nchapel. The 1522-3 list of ‘Rewardes’ has ‘them of his Lordship Chappell\r\nand other his Lordshipis Servaunts that doith play the Play befor his\r\nLordship uppon Shroftewsday at night, xˢ,’ and again, ‘Master of the\r\nRevells ... yerly for the overseyinge and orderinge of his Lordschip’s\r\nplayes interludes and Dresinge [? disguisinges] that is plaid befor his\r\nLordship in his Hous in the xij days of Xmas, xxˢ.’ This latter officer\r\nseems to have been, as at court, distinct from the ‘Abbot of Miserewll’\r\n(vol. i. p. 418).\r\n\r\n[565] _Black Books of Lincoln’s Inn_, i. 104, 119.\r\n\r\n[566] Hall, 719; Collier, i. 103.\r\n\r\n[567] R.

Ascham, _Epist_.\r\n(1581), f. 126ᵛ, writing †1550 (quoted Hazlitt-Warton, iii. 304) says\r\nthat Antwerp excels all other cities ‘quemadmodum aula Iohannis,\r\ntheatrali more ornata, seipsam post Natalem superat.’ Speaking in _The\r\nScholemaster_ (ed. Mayor, 1863), 168, of his contemporaries at St. John’s\r\n(†1530-54), Ascham highly praises the _Absalon_ of Thomas Watson, which\r\nhe puts on a level with Buchanan’s _Jephthah_. Watson, however, ‘would\r\nnever suffer it to go abroad.’ This play apparently exists in manuscript;\r\ncf. _Texts_ (iv). Ascham himself, according to his _Epistles_,\r\ntranslated the _Philoktetes_ into Latin (Hazlitt, _Manual_, 179). In\r\n_The Scholemaster_, he further says, ‘One man in Cambrige, well liked of\r\nmany, but best liked of him selfe, was many tymes bold and busie to bryng\r\nmatters upon stages which he called Tragedies.’ Ascham did not approve of\r\nhis Latin metre. Possibly he refers to John Christopherson, afterwards\r\nbishop of Chichester, to whom Warton, iii. 303; Cooper, _Athenae Cantab._\r\ni. 188; _D. N. B._ attribute a tragedy in Greek and Latin of _Jepthes_\r\n(1546). I can find no trace of this. It is not mentioned by Bahlmann.\r\n\r\n[573] Cf. p. 220.\r\n\r\n[574] J.

But the\r\ndates given in his _Hist. of Poetry_ (ed. Hazlitt), ii. 234, iii. 312,\r\nand his _Life of Sir Thomas Pope_ (ed. 1780), 46, do not agree together,\r\nand the authority to which he refers (_Machyn’s Diary_, then in MS.) does\r\nnot bear him out. On his _bona fides_ cf. H. E. D. Blakiston, in _E. H.\r\nReview_, for April, 1896. Ward, i. 153, rather complicates the matter by\r\nadding to _Holophernes_ a second play called _The Hanging of Antioch_,\r\nbut even in Warton’s account this ‘hanging’ was only a curtain.\r\n\r\n[586] Bale, _Scriptores_ (1557), i. 700 ‘Radulphus Radclif, patria\r\nCestriensis, Huchiniae in agro Hartfordiensi, & in coenobio, quod paulo\r\nante Carmelitarum erat, ludum literarium anno Domini 1538 aperuit,\r\ndocuitque Latinas literas.

Nescioque an\r\nsub Antichristi tyrannide adhuc vivat.’ Bale, _Index_, 333, has fuller\r\ntitles. Some of Radclif’s plays were almost certainly in Latin, for Bale\r\ngives in Latin the opening words of each, and as Herford, 113, points\r\nout, those of the _Lazarus_ and the _Griselda_ clearly form parts of\r\nLatin verses. But he showed them ‘plebi.’ Professor Herford learnt ‘that\r\nno old MSS. in any way connected with Radclif now remain at Hitchin,\r\nwhere his family still occupies the site of his school.’\r\n\r\n[587] Julleville, _Les Com._, _passim_. A collection of farces is in E.\r\nL. N. Viollet-le-Duc, _Ancien Théâtre français_ (1854-7). For morals\r\nand farces at the Feasts of Fools and of the Boy Bishop abroad, and for\r\nthe satirical tendency of such entertainments, cf. vol. i. p. 380. In\r\n1427, after the feast of St. Laurent, Jean Bussières, chaplain of St.\r\nRemi de Troyes, ‘emendavit quod fecerat certum perconnagium rimarum in\r\ncimiterio dicte ecclesie Sancti Remigii; de quibus rimis fuerat dyabolus\r\net dixerat plura verba contra viros ecclesiasticos’ (_Inv. des Arch, de\r\nl’Aube_, sér. G, i. 243). The fifteenth-century Dutch farces appear to\r\nhave been played at the meetings of the _Rederijkerkammern_, and the\r\nGerman _Fastnachtsspiele_, which derive largely from folk _ludi_, by\r\nassociations of handicraftsmen (Creizenach, i. 404, 407).\r\n\r\n[588] Julleville, _Les Com._ 325.\r\n\r\n[589] Ibid. 342. There is nothing to show the character of the French\r\nplayers who visited the English court in 1494 and 1495 (Appendix E, viii).\r\n\r\n[590] Cf. p. 190 and vol. i. p. 383. The only known English _puy_ is that\r\nof London (vol. i. p. 376).\r\n\r\n[591] The titles of the printed plays do not help, as they were probably\r\nadded by the printers, and in any case ‘enterlude’ does not exclude a\r\npopular play.\r\n\r\n[592] _Hist. MSS._ vii. 613.\r\n\r\n[593] Collier, ii. 196, quotes the description by Willis, _Mount Tabor_\r\n(1639), and refers to other notices of the play. In _Sir Thomas More_\r\n(†1590, ed. A. Dyce, from _Harl. MS._ 7368 for Shakes. Soc. 1844) ‘my\r\nlord Cardinall’s players’ visit More’s house and offer the following\r\nrepertory:\r\n\r\n              ‘The Cradle of Securitie,\r\n  Hit nayle o’ th’ head, Impacient Pouertie,\r\n  The play of Foure Pees, Diues and Lazarus,\r\n  Lustie Juuentus, and the Mariage of Witt and Wisedom.’\r\n\r\nThe ascription of these plays to Wolsey’s lifetime must not be pressed\r\ntoo literally. Of _Hit Nayle o’ th’ Head_ nothing is known. Radclif (p.\r\n197) wrote a _Dives and Lazarus_. For the rest cf. p. 189; _Texts_ (iv).\r\nThe piece actually performed in _Sir Thomas More_ is called _Wit and\r\nWisdom_, but is really an adaptation of part of _Lusty Juventus_. A play\r\nof _Old Custome_, probably a morality, was amongst the effects of John,\r\nearl of Warwick, in 1545-50 (_Hist. MSS._ ii. 102).\r\n\r\n[594] Cf. Brandl, xl. The performances of _Everyman_ given in the\r\ncourtyard of the Charterhouse in 1901, and subsequently in more than one\r\nLondon theatre, have proved quite unexpectedly impressive.\r\n\r\n[595] John Rastell printed †1536 _Of gentylnes and nobylyte, A dyalogue\r\n... compilit in maner of an enterlude with divers toys and gestis addyd\r\nthereto to make mery pastyme and disport_; cf. _Bibliographica_, ii.\r\n446. Heywood’s _Witty and Witless_ is a similar piece, and a later one,\r\n_Robin Conscience_, is in W. C. Hazlitt, _Early Popular Poetry_, iii.\r\n221. In 1527 Rastell seems to have provided for the court a pageant of\r\n‘The Father of Hevin’ in which a dialogue, both in English and Latin,\r\nof riches and love, written by John Redman, and also a ‘barriers’\r\nwere introduced (Brewer, iv. 1394; Collier, i. 98; Hall, 723; Brown,\r\n_Venetian Papers_, iv. 105). A dialogue of Riches and Youth, issuing in\r\na ‘barriers,’ is described by Edward VI in 1552 (_Remains_, ii. 386).\r\nOn the vogue during the Renascence of this dialogue literature, which\r\nderives from the mediaeval _débats_, cf. Herford, ch. 2.\r\n\r\n[596] Collier, i. 69. This notice is said by Collier to be from a slip of\r\npaper folded up in the _Revels Account_ for 1513-4. It is not mentioned\r\nin Brewer’s _Calendar_.\r\n\r\n[597] Leland, _Collectanea_ (ed. Hearne), iv. 265; _Computus_ for 1551-6\r\nof Sir Thos. Chaloner (_Lansd. MS._ 824, f. 24) ‘Gevyn on Shrove monday\r\nto the king’s players who playd the play of Self-love ... xx⁸.’\r\n\r\n[598] Cf. ch. xvi.\r\n\r\n[599] There was a ‘farsche’ at Edinburgh in 1554 (_Representations_,\r\ns.v.). In 1558 the Scottish General Assembly forbade ‘farseis and clerke\r\nplayis’ (Christie, _Account of Parish Clerks_, 64). Julleville, _La Com._\r\n51, explains the term. _Farsa_ is the L. L. past part. of _farcire_ ‘to\r\nstuff.’ Besides its liturgical use (vol. i. p. 277) ‘on appela _farce_\r\nau théâtre une petite pièce, une courte et vive satire formée d’éléments\r\nvariés et souvent mêlée de divers langages et de différents dialectes....\r\nPlus tard, ce sens premier s’effaça; le mot de farce n’éveilla plus\r\nd’autre idée que celle de comédie très réjouissante.’ _Farce_ is,\r\ntherefore, in its origin, precisely equivalent to the Latin _Satura_.\r\n\r\n[600] Cf. vol. i. p. 83.\r\n\r\n[601] _Texts_, s.v. Lyndsay. The only other fragment of the Scottish\r\ndrama under James IV is that ascribed to Dunbar (_Works_, ed. Scot. Text\r\nSoc., ii. 314). In one MS. this is headed ‘_Ane Littill Interlud of the\r\nDroichis Part of the_ [_Play_] but in another _Heir followis the maner\r\nof the crying of ane playe_. Both have the colophon. _Finis off the\r\nDroichis Pairt of the Play._ From internal evidence the piece is a _cry_\r\nor _banes_. Ll. 138-41 show that it was for a May-game:\r\n\r\n  ‘ȝe noble merchandis ever ilkane\r\n  Address ȝow furth with bow and flane\r\n        In lusty grene lufraye,\r\n  And follow furth on Robyn Hude.’\r\n\r\n[602] Cushman, 63, 68.\r\n\r\n[603] No play in the first two sections of the ‘vice-dramas’ tabulated\r\nby Cushman, 55, has a vice. Of the eleven plays (excluding _King John_,\r\nwhich has none) that remain, eight can be called morals. But to these\r\nmust be added Heywood’s _Love_ and _Weather_, Grimald’s _Archipropheta_,\r\n_Jack Juggler_, _Hester_, _Tom Tiler and His Wife_, none of which are\r\nmorals, unless the first can be so called.\r\n\r\n[604] Cushman, 68. It has been derived from _vis d’âne_, and from\r\n_vis_, ‘a mask’; from the Latin _vice_, because the vice is the devil’s\r\nrepresentative; from _device_, ‘a puppet moved by machinery,’ and\r\nfinally, by the ingenious Theobald, from ‘O. E. _jeck_—Gk. εἰκαῖ, i.e.\r\nϝικαῖ = ϝείκ = formal character.’\r\n\r\n[605] Cf. _Texts_, s.v. Medwall. In _Misogonos_ (†1560) Cacurgus, the\r\n_Morio_, is a character, and is called ‘foole’ and ‘nodye’ but not ‘vice.’\r\n\r\n[606] Collier, ii. 191; Cushman, 69; cf. ch. xvi.\r\n\r\n[607] Cf. _Representations_, s.vv.

One of the exceptionally learned\r\nmen who really knew something about the classical drama was John of\r\nSalisbury (†1159), _Polycraticus_, i. 8 ‘comicis et tragoedis abeuntibus,\r\ncum omnia levitas occupaverit, clientes eorum, comoedi videlicet et\r\ntragoedi, exterminati sunt’; iii. 8 ‘comoedia est vita hominis super\r\nterram, ubi quisque sui oblitus personam exprimit alienam’ (_P. L._\r\ncxcix. 405, 488). For the popular notion cf. Lydgate, _Troy Book_ (ed.\r\n1555), ii. 11, perhaps translating Guido delle Colonne:\r\n\r\n  ‘In the theatre there was a smale aulter,\r\n  Amyddes sette that was half Circuler,\r\n  Which into East of custome was directe,\r\n  Upon the whiche a Pulpet was erecte,\r\n  And therin stode an auncient poete,\r\n  For to reherse by rethorykes swete,\r\n  The noble dedes that were hystoryall,\r\n  Of kynges & prynces for memoryall ...\r\n  All this was tolde and red of the Poete,\r\n  And whyle that he in the pulpet stode,\r\n  With deadly face all deuoyde of blode,\r\n  Synging his ditees with muses all to rent,\r\n  Amyd the theatre shrowded in a tent,\r\n  There came out men gastfull of their cheres,\r\n  Disfygured their faces with viseres,\r\n  Playing by sygnes in the peoples syght,\r\n  That the Poet songe hath on heyght, ...\r\n  And this was done in Apryll and in May.’\r\n\r\n[622] Creizenach, i. 6; Cloetta, i. 35.

Tragoedia\r\nvero poesis a laeto principio in tristem finem desinens.’ The\r\nDante-commentator Francesco da Buti, quoted by Cloetta i. 48, illustrates\r\nthis notion with an extraordinary explanation of the derivation of\r\n_tragedia_ from τράγος; ‘come il becco ha dinanzi aspetto di principe per\r\nle corna e per la barba, e dietro è sozzo mostrando le natiche nude e non\r\navendo con che coprirle, così la tragedia incomincia dal principio con\r\nfelicità e poi termina in miseria.’ Krumbacher, 646, describes the very\r\nsimilar history of the terms τραγῳδία and κωμῳδία in Byzantine Greek.\r\n\r\n[626] Boethius, who of course understood the nature of comedy and\r\ntragedy, says (_Cons. Philosoph._ ii. pr. 2. 36) ‘quid tragoediarum\r\nclamor aliud deflet, nisi indiscreto ictu fortunam felicia regna\r\nvertentem?’ This becomes in the paraphrase of his eleventh-century\r\ncommentator Notker Labeo (ed. Hattemar, 52ᵇ) ‘tragoediae sínt luctuosa\r\ncarmina. álso díu sínt. díu sophocles scréib apud grecos. de euersionibus\r\nregnorum et urbium. únde sínt uuideruuártig tien comoediis. án dîen uuir\r\nîo gehórên laetum únde iocundum exitum.’\r\n\r\n[627] Cloetta, i. 4; Teuffel, ii. 506. Blossius Aemilius Dracontius was a\r\nCarthaginian poet. The _Orestes_ is printed in L. Baehrens, _Poet. Lat.\r\nMin._ (_Bibl. Teub._), v. 218. There seems a little doubt whether the\r\ntitle _Orestis tragoedia_ in the Berne MS. is due to the author or to a\r\nscribe. The Ambrosian MS. has _Horestis fabula_.\r\n\r\n[628] Creizenach, i. 12.\r\n\r\n[629] Ibid. i. 7; Cloetta, i. 49. The _ludus prophetarum_ played at Riga\r\nin 1204 (p. 70) is called ‘ludus ... quam Latini comoediam vocant.’\r\nProbably this is a bit of learning on the part of the chronicler; cf. the\r\nMichael-House instance (p. 344). For scraps from non-dramatic classical\r\nauthors in liturgical plays, cf. p. 48. The ‘theatricales ludi’ of\r\nInnocent III and others (vol. i. p. 40; vol. ii. p. 99) seem to be not\r\nmiracle-plays, but the Feast of Fools and similar mummings.\r\n\r\n[630] Dante, _Dedicatio_ of _Paradiso_ to Can Grande (_Opere Latine_, ed.\r\nGiuliani, ii. 44) ‘est comoedia genus quoddam poeticae narrationis....\r\nDiffert ergo a tragoedia in materia per hoc quod tragoedia in principio\r\nest admirabilis et quieta, in fine sive exitu est foetida et horribilis\r\n... comoedia vero inchoat asperitatem alicuius rei, sed eius materia\r\nprospere terminatur.’ P. Toynbee (_Romania_, xxvi. 542) shows that Dante\r\nsubstantially owed these definitions to the _Magnae Derivationes_ of the\r\nlate twelfth-century writer, Uguccione da Pisa.\r\n\r\n[631] Boccaccio’s _Ameto_ bears the sub-title _Comedia delle Ninfe\r\nfiorentine_.\r\n\r\n[632] Chaucer, _Monk’s Prologue_, (_C. T._ 13,999):\r\n\r\n  ‘Or elles first Tragedies wol I telle\r\n  Of whiche I have an hundred in my celle.\r\n  Tragedie is to seyn a certeyn storie,\r\n  As olde bokes maken us memorie,\r\n  Of him that stood in greet prosperitee\r\n  And is y-fallen out of heigh degree\r\n  Into miserie, and endeth wrecchedly.’\r\n\r\nCf. the gloss in his _Boethius_, ii. pr. 2, 78, to the passage already\r\nquoted on p. 20; and the description of _Troilus_ in _T.

N. B._, through a\r\nconfusion with the anti-Lutheran play at court (cf. p. 196), as 1527. It\r\nis often identified with the _Dido_ played before Elizabeth at Cambridge\r\nin 1564. But there is no reason to doubt the statement of Hatcher’s\r\nsixteenth-century MS. account of King’s College (transcript in _Bodl._\r\n11,614) that the author of this was Edward Halliwell, who, like Ritwise,\r\nwas a fellow of the college.\r\n\r\n[647] Cf. p. 195.\r\n\r\n[648] For the translation of the _Philoktetes_ of Sophocles by Roger\r\nAscham, cf. p. 195.

Many plays of this school are in _Comoediae et Tragoediae\r\naliquot ex Novo et Vetere Testamento desumptae_ (Brylinger, Basle, 1540)\r\nand _Dramata Sacra_ (Oporinus, Basle, 1547).\r\n\r\n[650] Creizenach, ii. 76; Herford, 119; Bahlmann, _L.

Both Thomas Artour, of Cambridge (ob. 1532), who wrote\r\na _Microcosmum, tragoediam_, and a _Mundum plumbeum, tragoediam_ (Bale,\r\ni. 709), and John Hooker (ob. †1543), of Magdalen College, Oxford, who\r\nwrote a _comoediam, scilicet Piscatorem ... alio titulo Fraus illusa\r\nvocatur_ (Bale, i. 712), seem to have been Protestants, but nothing is\r\nknown of the character of their plays, which may have been either English\r\nor Latin.\r\n\r\n[652] Cf. p. 197.\r\n\r\n[653] Bale, _Scriptores_, i. 674.

D._ 48, shows that\r\nthe two had several characters in common. Another anti-Luther play, the\r\n_Monachopornomachia_ (1538) of Simon Lemnius (Bahlmann, _L.

It\r\nwould be better that the plays of Robin Hood and Maid Marian should be\r\nforbidden, and others devised to set forth and declare lively before\r\nthe people’s eyes the abomination and wickedness of the bishop of Rome,\r\nthe monks, friars, nuns and such like, and to declare the obedience due\r\nto the King.’ In 1543 the Lord Mayor complained to the Privy Council of\r\nthe ‘licentious manner of players.’ Certain joiners, who were the Lord\r\nWarden’s players, were imprisoned and reprimanded for playing on Sunday\r\n(_P.

I have\r\nalready (p. 185) called attention to the ambiguity of the term ‘comon\r\nplayer,’ and on the whole, in view of a reference in the proclamation to\r\n‘theft and falsehood in play’ I think that gamblers are here in question.\r\nIn any case the protected players were not suppressed.\r\n\r\n[668] 1 _Edw.

In Feb. 1556 the council sent Lord Rich to\r\ninquire into a stage-play to be given at Shrovetide at Hatfield Bradock,\r\nEssex, and directed him to stop such assemblies. An order against\r\nstrolling players who spread sedition and heresy came in May. In June,\r\n1557, performers of ‘naughty’ and ‘lewd’ plays were arrested in London\r\nand Canterbury. An order forbade plays throughout the country during\r\nthe summer. In August a ‘lewd’ play called a ‘Sackfull of News’ was\r\nsuppressed at the Boar’s Head, Aldgate; and in September plays were\r\nforbidden in the city except, after licence by the ordinary, between All\r\nSaints and Shrovetide.\r\n\r\n[678] The proclamation of 16 May 1559 is printed in Hazlitt, _E.

Canon Morris does not say where he found the document.\r\nHe dates it in ‘24 Hen. VIII, 1531.’ [The regnal year. 24 Hen. VIII,\r\nby the way, is 1532-3.] But the monastery is called ‘dissolved,’ which\r\nit was not until 1541. The list of Mayors (Morris, 582) gives William\r\nSnead (1516-7), William Sneyde (1531-2), William Sneyde, jun. (1543-4).\r\nObviously two generations are concerned. The second mayoralty of the\r\nyounger man was 1543-4. And the appointment of Newhall as clerk of the\r\nPentice was in 1543 (Morris, 204). Oddly, Canon Morris’s error was\r\nanticipated in a copy of the proclamation made on the fly-leaf of _Harl.\r\nMS._ 2013 of the plays (Deimling, 1), which states that it was ‘made by\r\nWᵐ newall, Clarke of the pentice [in R]udio 24, H. 8 [1532-3].’\r\n\r\n[777] I reproduce Canon Morris’s text _literatim_. But he does not\r\nexplain the square brackets, and I do not understand them.\r\n\r\n[778] The ‘proclamation’ in the White Book is clearly a revision of\r\nthe 1544 version. On the other hand, the Corpus Christi procession was\r\nsuppressed in 1547. The ‘Banns,’ which include a pageant ‘of our lady\r\nthassumpcon’ not in the list of plays, are perhaps rather earlier.\r\n\r\n[779] _Harl. MS._ 2150, ff. 85ᵇ-88ᵇ.\r\n\r\n[780] It is this entry which shows that _Harl. MS._ 2150 is not the\r\n‘White Book,’ but a copy. The official catalogue of the Harleian\r\ncollection is in doubt on this point.\r\n\r\n[781] So printed by Furnivall, possibly as an addition to the text of\r\n_Harl._ 1944, from the shorter copy of the _Breauarye_ in _Harl._ 1948.\r\n\r\n[782] _Hist. MSS._ i. 49.\r\n\r\n[783] C. L. Kingsford in _D. N. B._ s.v. Higden. Mr. Kingsford does not\r\nthink that ‘Randle Heggenett,’ the author of the _Chester Plays_, can be\r\nidentified with Higden. But ‘Higden,’ which occurs in Rogers’s list of\r\nMayors, is an earlier form in the tradition than ‘Heggenett.’\r\n\r\n[784] Ormerod, _Hist. of Cheshire_ (ed.

Ch.) ‘This yeare the King came to se the\r\nplayes acted by the Gray Friers and much commended them.’ The mayoral\r\nlist in this text of the _Annals_ goes to 1675. It is probably another\r\nthat Sharp, _Diss._ 5, quotes as making the same statement and describes\r\nas ‘not older than the _beginning_ of Charles I’s reign.’ He does not\r\ngive the full entry. Is it the basis of Mr. Fretton’s addition to the\r\n1871 ed. of Sharp’s _Hist. and Antiq. of Cov._ 202 ‘1492. Henry 7th and\r\nhis Queen saw the Plays at Whitsuntide’? Can ‘by the Gray Friers’ mean\r\n‘at a station by the convent’? In the Carpenters’ accounts for 1453 is\r\nan item ‘for the mynstrell at the frerˢ.’ This, says Sharp, _Diss._ 213,\r\nrelates to the craft’s annual dinner held at the White Friars. There is\r\nno other possible allusion to friars’ plays in Mr. Sharp’s extracts.\r\n\r\n[942] Ten Brink, iii. 276; Sharp, 45.\r\n\r\n[943] Hohlfeld, in _Anglia_, xi. 228.\r\n\r\n[944] The term ‘pageant’ is once used in the stage-directions (Halliwell,\r\n132) ‘Hic intrabit pagentum de purgatione Mariae et Joseph.’\r\n\r\n[945] Ten Brink, ii. 283; Pollard, xxxvii.
