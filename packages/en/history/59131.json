(1.)—THE EXTREME SMALLNESS OF INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed to a description of the insects, a subject replete\r\nwith endless difficulties;[3] for, in fact, there are some authors who\r\nhave maintained that they do not respire, and that they are destitute\r\nof blood. The insects are numerous, and form many species, and their\r\nmode of life is like that of the terrestrial animals and the birds.\r\nSome of them are furnished with wings, bees for instance; others\r\nare divided into those kinds which have wings, and those which are\r\nwithout them, such as ants; while others, again, are destitute of\r\nboth wings and feet. All these animals have been very properly called\r\n“insects,”[4] from the incisures or divisions which separate the body,\r\nsometimes at the neck, and sometimes at the corselet, and so divide\r\nit into members or segments, only united to each other by a slender\r\ntube. In some insects, however, this division is not complete, as it\r\nis surrounded by wrinkled folds; and thus the flexible vertebræ of the\r\ncreature, whether situate at the abdomen, or whether only at the upper\r\npart of the body, are protected by layers, overlapping each other;\r\nindeed, in no one of her works has Nature more fully displayed her\r\nexhaustless ingenuity.\r\n\r\n(2.) In large animals, on the other hand, or, at all events, in the\r\nvery largest among them, she found her task easy and her materials\r\nready and pliable; but in these minute creatures, so nearly akin as\r\nthey are to non-entity, how surpassing the intelligence, how vast the\r\nresources, and how ineffable the perfection which she has displayed.\r\nWhere is it that she has united so many senses as in the gnat?—not to\r\nspeak of creatures that might be mentioned of still smaller size—Where,\r\nI say, has she found room to place in it the organs of sight? Where\r\nhas she centred the sense of taste? Where has she inserted the power\r\nof smell? And where, too, has she implanted that sharp shrill voice of\r\nthe creature, so utterly disproportioned to the smallness of its body?\r\nWith what astonishing subtlety has she united the wings to the trunk,\r\nelongated the joints of the legs, framed that long, craving concavity\r\nfor a belly, and then inflamed the animal with an insatiate thirst for\r\nblood, that of man more especially! What ingenuity has she displayed in\r\nproviding it with a sting,[5] so well adapted for piercing the skin!\r\nAnd then too, just as though she had had the most extensive field for\r\nthe exercise of her skill, although the weapon is so minute that it can\r\nhardly be seen, she has formed it with a twofold mechanism, providing\r\nit with a point for the purpose of piercing, and at the same moment\r\nmaking it hollow, to adapt it for suction.\r\n\r\nWhat teeth, too, has she inserted in the teredo,[6] to adapt it for\r\npiercing oak even with a sound which fully attests their destructive\r\npower! while at the same time she has made wood its principal\r\nnutriment. We give all our admiration to the shoulders of the elephant\r\nas it supports the turret, to the stalwart neck of the bull, and the\r\nmight with which it hurls aloft whatever comes in its way, to the\r\nonslaught of the tiger, or to the mane of the lion; while, at the\r\nsame time, Nature is nowhere to be seen to greater perfection than in\r\nthe very smallest of her works. For this reason then, I must beg of\r\nmy readers, notwithstanding the contempt they feel for many of these\r\nobjects, not to feel a similar disdain for the information I am about\r\nto give relative thereto, seeing that, in the study of Nature, there\r\nare none of her works that are unworthy of our consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (3.)—WHETHER INSECTS RESPIRE, AND WHETHER THEY HAVE BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany authors deny that insects respire,[7] and make the assertion upon\r\nthe ground, that in their viscera there is no respiratory organ to be\r\nfound. On this ground, they assert that insects have the same kind of\r\nlife as plants and trees, there being a very great difference between\r\nrespiring and merely having life. On similar grounds also, they assert\r\nthat insects have no blood, a thing which cannot exist, they say, in\r\nany animal that is destitute of heart and liver; just as, according to\r\nthem, those creatures cannot breathe which have no lungs. Upon these\r\npoints, however, a vast number of questions will naturally arise; for\r\nthe same writers do not hesitate to deny that these creatures are\r\ndestitute also of voice,[8] and this, notwithstanding the humming of\r\nbees, the chirping of grasshoppers, and the sounds emitted by numerous\r\nother insects which will be considered in their respective places.\r\nFor my part, whenever I have considered the subject, I have ever felt\r\npersuaded that there is nothing impossible to Nature, nor do I see\r\nwhy creatures should be less able to live and yet not inhale, than to\r\nrespire without being possessed of viscera, a doctrine which I have\r\nalready maintained, when speaking[9] of the marine animals; and that,\r\nnotwithstanding the density and the vast depth of the water which would\r\nappear to impede all breathing. But what person could very easily\r\nbelieve that there can be any creatures that fly to and fro, and live\r\nin the very midst of the element of respiration, while, at the same\r\ntime, they themselves are devoid of that respiration; that they can\r\nbe possessed of the requisite instincts for nourishment, generation,\r\nworking, and making provision even for time to come, in the enjoyment\r\ntoo (although, certainly, they are not possessed of the organs which\r\nact, as it were, as the receptacles of those senses) of the powers of\r\nhearing, smelling, and tasting, as well as those other precious gifts\r\nof Nature, address, courage, and skilfulness? That these creatures have\r\nno blood[10] I am ready to admit, just as all the terrestrial animals\r\nare not possessed of it; but then, they have something similar, by way\r\nof equivalent. Just as in the sea, the sæpia[11] has a black liquid in\r\nplace of blood, and the various kinds of purples, those juices which\r\nwe use for the purposes of dyeing; so, too, is every insect possessed\r\nof its own vital humour, which, whatever it is, is blood to it. While\r\nI leave it to others to form what opinion they please on this subject,\r\nit is my purpose to set forth the operations of Nature in the clearest\r\npossible light, and not to enter upon the discussion of points that are\r\nreplete with doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (4.)—THE BODIES OF INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsects, so far as I find myself able to ascertain, seem to have\r\nneither sinews,[12] bones, spines, cartilages, fat, nor flesh; nor yet\r\nso much as a frail shell, like some of the marine animals, nor even\r\nanything that can with any propriety be termed skin; but they have a\r\nbody which is of a kind of intermediate nature between all these, of an\r\narid substance, softer than muscle, and in other respects of a nature\r\nthat may, in strictness, be rather pronounced yielding,[13] than hard.\r\nSuch, then, is all that they are, and nothing more:[14] in the inside\r\nof their bodies there is nothing, except in some few, which have an\r\nintestine arranged in folds. Hence it is, that even when cut asunder,\r\nthey are remarkable for their tenacity of life, and the palpitations\r\nwhich are to be seen in each of their parts. For every portion of them\r\nis possessed of its own vital principle, which is centred in no limb\r\nin particular, but in every part of the body; least of all, however,\r\nin the head, which alone is subject to no movements unless torn off\r\ntogether with the corselet. No kind of animal has more feet than the\r\ninsects have, and those among them which have the most, live the\r\nlongest when cut asunder, as we see in the case of the scolopendra.\r\nThey have eyes, and the senses as well of touch and taste; some of them\r\nhave also the sense of smelling, and some few that of hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (5.)—BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut among them all, the first rank, and our especial admiration, ought,\r\nin justice, to be accorded to bees, which alone, of all the insects,\r\nhave been created for the benefit of man. They extract honey and\r\ncollect it, a juicy substance remarkable for its extreme sweetness,\r\nlightness, and wholesomeness. They form their combs and collect wax,\r\nan article that is useful for a thousand purposes of life; they are\r\npatient of fatigue, toil at their labours, form themselves into\r\npolitical communities, hold councils together in private, elect chiefs\r\nin common, and, a thing that is the most remarkable of all, have their\r\nown code of morals. In addition to this, being as they are, neither\r\ntame nor wild, so all-powerful is Nature, that, from a creature so\r\nminute as to be nothing more hardly than the shadow of an animal, she\r\nhas created a marvel beyond all comparison. What muscular power, what\r\nexertion of strength are we to put in comparison with such vast energy\r\nand such industry as theirs? What display of human genius, in a word,\r\nshall we compare with the reasoning powers manifested by them? In this\r\nthey have, at all events, the advantage of us—they know of nothing but\r\nwhat is for the common benefit of all. Away, then, with all questions\r\nwhether they respire or no, and let us be ready to agree on the\r\nquestion of their blood; and yet, how little of it can possibly exist\r\nin bodies so minute as theirs.—And now let us form some idea of the\r\ninstinct they display.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (6.)—THE ORDER DISPLAYED IN THE WORKS OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBees keep within the hive during the winter—for whence are they to\r\nderive the strength requisite to withstand frosts and snows, and the\r\nnorthern blasts? The same, in fact, is done by all insects, but not\r\nto so late a period; as those which conceal themselves in the walls\r\nof our houses, are much sooner sensible of the returning warmth. With\r\nreference to bees, either seasons and climates have considerably\r\nchanged, or else former writers have been greatly mistaken. They retire\r\nfor the winter at the setting of the Vergiliæ, and remain shut up till\r\nafter the rising of that constellation, and not till only the beginning\r\nof spring, as some authors have stated; nor, indeed, does any one in\r\nItaly ever think of then opening the hives. They do not come forth to\r\nply their labours until the bean blossoms; and then not a day do they\r\nlose in inactivity, while the weather is favourable for their pursuits.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, they set about constructing their combs, and forming the\r\nwax, or, in other words, making their dwellings and cells; after this\r\nthey produce their young, and then make honey and wax from flowers,\r\nand extract bee-glue[15] from the tears of those trees which distil\r\nglutinous substances, the juices, gums, and resins, namely, of the\r\nwillow, the elm, and the reed. With these substances, as well as others\r\nof a more bitter nature, they first line the whole inside of the hive,\r\nas a sort of protection against the greedy propensities of other small\r\ninsects, as they are well aware that they are about to form that which\r\nwill prove an object of attraction to them. Having done this, they\r\nemploy similar substances in narrowing the entrance to the hive, if\r\notherwise too wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (5.)—THE MEANING OF THE TERMS COMMOSIS, PISSOCEROS, AND\r\nPROPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe persons who understand this subject, call the substance which\r\nforms the first foundation of their combs, _commosis_,[16] the next,\r\n_pissoceros_,[17] and the third _propolis_;[18] which last is placed\r\nbetween the other layers and the wax, and is remarkable for its utility\r\nin medicine.[19] The commosis forms the first crust or layer, and has a\r\nbitter taste; and upon it is laid the pissoceros, a kind of thin wax,\r\nwhich acts as a sort of varnish. The propolis is produced from the\r\nsweet gum of the vine or the poplar, and is of a denser consistency,\r\nthe juices of flowers being added to it. Still, however, it cannot be\r\nproperly termed wax, but rather the foundation of the honey-combs; by\r\nmeans of it all inlets are stopped up, which might, otherwise, serve\r\nfor the admission of cold or other injurious influences; it has also a\r\nstrong odour, so much so, indeed, that many people use it instead of\r\ngalbanum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—THE MEANING OF ERITHACE, SANDARACA, OR CERINTHOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the bees form collections of _erithace_ or\r\nbee-bread, which some persons call “sandaraca,”[20] and others\r\n“cerinthos.” This is to serve as the food of the bees while they are\r\nat work, and is often found stowed away in the cavities of the cells,\r\nbeing of a bitter flavour also. It is produced from the spring dews and\r\nthe gummy juices of trees, being less abundant while the south-west\r\nwind is blowing, and blackened by the prevalence of a south wind. On\r\nthe other hand, again, it is of a reddish colour and becomes improved\r\nby the north-east wind; it is found in the greatest abundance upon the\r\nnut trees in Greece. Menecrates says, that it is a flower, which gives\r\nindications of the nature of the coming harvest; but no one says so,\r\nwith the exception of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (8.)—WHAT FLOWERS ARE USED BY THE BEES IN THEIR WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nBees form wax[21] from the blossoms of all trees and plants, with\r\nthe sole exception of the rumex[22] and the echinopodes,[23] both\r\nbeing kinds of herbs. It is by mistake, however, that spartum is\r\nexcepted;[24] for many varieties of honey that come from Spain, and\r\nhave been made in the plantations of it, have a strong taste of that\r\nplant. I am of opinion, also, that it is without any sufficient reason\r\nthat the olive has been excepted, seeing that it is a well-known fact,\r\nthat where olives are in the greatest abundance, the swarms of bees are\r\nthe most numerous. Bees are not injurious to fruit of any kind; they\r\nwill never settle on a dead flower, much less a dead carcase. They\r\npursue their labours within three-score paces of their hives; and when\r\nthe flowers in their vicinity are exhausted, they send out scouts from\r\ntime to time, to discover places for forage at a greater distance. When\r\novertaken by night in their expeditions, they watch till the morning,\r\nlying on their backs, in order to protect their wings from the action\r\nof the dew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (9.)—PERSONS WHO HAVE MADE BEES THEIR STUDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that there have been persons who have made bees\r\ntheir exclusive study; Aristomachus of Soli, for instance, who for a\r\nperiod of fifty-eight years did nothing else; Philiscus of Thasos,\r\nalso, surnamed Agrius,[25] who passed his life in desert spots, tending\r\nswarms of bees. Both of these have written works on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (10.)—THE MODE IN WHICH BEES WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner in which bees carry on their work is as follows. In the\r\nday time a guard is stationed at the entrance of the hive, like the\r\nsentries in a camp. At night they take their rest until the morning,\r\nwhen one of them awakes the rest with a humming noise, repeated twice\r\nor thrice, just as though it were sounding a trumpet. They then take\r\ntheir flight in a body, if the day is likely to turn out fine; for they\r\nhave the gift of foreknowing wind and rain, and in such case will keep\r\nclose within their dwellings. On the other hand, when the weather is\r\nfine—and this, too, they have the power of foreknowing—the swarm issues\r\nforth, and at once applies itself to its work, some loading their\r\nlegs from the flowers, while others fill their mouths with water, and\r\ncharge the downy surface of their bodies with drops of liquid. Those\r\namong them that are young[26] go forth to their labours, and collect\r\nthe materials already mentioned, while those that are more aged stay\r\nwithin the hives and work. The bees whose business it is to carry the\r\nflowers, with their fore feet load their thighs, which Nature has made\r\nrough for the purpose, and with their trunks load their fore feet:\r\nbending beneath their load, they then return to the hive, where there\r\nare three or four bees ready to receive them, and aid in discharging\r\ntheir burdens. For, within the hive as well, they have their allotted\r\nduties to perform: some are engaged in building, others in smoothing,\r\nthe combs, while others again are occupied in passing on the materials,\r\nand others in preparing food[27] from the provision which has been\r\nbrought; that there may be no unequal division, either in their labour,\r\ntheir food, or the distribution of their time, they do not even feed\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nCommencing at the vaulted roof of the hive, they begin the construction\r\nof their cells, and, just as we do in the manufacture of a web, they\r\nconstruct their cells from top to bottom, taking care to leave two\r\npassages around each compartment, for the entrance of some and the exit\r\nof others. The combs, which are fastened to the hive in the upper part,\r\nand in a slight degree also at the sides, adhere to each other, and are\r\nthus suspended altogether. They do not touch the floor of the hive,\r\nand are either angular or round, according to its shape; sometimes,\r\nin fact, they are both angular and round at once, when two swarms are\r\nliving in unison, but have dissimilar modes of operation. They prop\r\nup the combs that are likely to fall, by means of arched pillars, at\r\nintervals springing from the floor, so as to leave them a passage for\r\nthe purpose of effecting repairs. The first three ranks of their cells\r\nare generally left empty when constructed, that there may be nothing\r\nexposed to view which may invite theft; and it is the last ones, more\r\nespecially, that are filled with honey: hence it is that the combs are\r\nalways taken out at the back of the hive.\r\n\r\nThe bees that are employed in carrying look out for a favourable\r\nbreeze, and if a gale should happen to spring up, they poise themselves\r\nin the air with little stones, by way of ballast; some writers,\r\nindeed, say that they place them upon their shoulders. When the wind\r\nis contrary, they fly close to the ground, taking care, however, to\r\nkeep clear of the brambles. It is wonderful what strict watch is kept\r\nupon their work: all instances of idleness are carefully remarked, the\r\noffenders are chastised, and on a repetition of the fault, punished\r\nwith death. Their sense of cleanliness, too, is quite extraordinary;\r\neverything is removed that might be in the way, and no filth is allowed\r\nto remain in the midst of their work. The ordure even of those that are\r\nat work within, that they may not have to retire to any distance, is\r\nall collected in one spot, and on stormy days, when they are obliged\r\nto cease their ordinary labours, they employ themselves in carrying it\r\nout. When it grows towards evening, the buzzing in the hive becomes\r\ngradually less and less, until at last one of their number is to be\r\nseen flying about the hive with the same loud humming noise with which\r\nthey were aroused in the morning, thereby giving the signal, as it\r\nwere, to retire to rest: in this, too, they imitate the usage of the\r\ncamp. The moment the signal is heard, all is silent.\r\n\r\n(11.) They first construct the dwellings of the commonalty, and then\r\nthose of the king-bee. If they have reason to expect an abundant[28]\r\nseason, they add abodes also for the drones: these are cells of a\r\nsmaller size, though the drones themselves are larger than the bees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—DRONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drones have no sting,[29] and would seem to be a kind of imperfect\r\nbee, formed the very last of all; the expiring effort, as it were, of\r\nworn-out and exhausted old age, a late and tardy offspring, and doomed,\r\nin a measure, to be the slaves of the genuine bees. Hence it is that\r\nthe bees exercise over them a rigorous authority, compel them to take\r\nthe foremost rank in their labours, and if they show any sluggishness,\r\npunish them[30] without mercy. And not only in their labours do the\r\ndrones give them their assistance, but in the propagation of their\r\nspecies as well, the very multitude of them contributing greatly to the\r\nwarmth of the hive. At all events, it is a well-known fact, that the\r\ngreater[31] the multitude of the drones, the more numerous is sure\r\nto be the progeny of the swarm. When the honey is beginning to come\r\nto maturity, the bees drive away the drones, and setting upon each in\r\ngreat numbers, put them all to death. It is only in the spring that the\r\ndrones are ever to be seen. If you deprive a drone of its wings, and\r\nthen replace it in the hive, it will pull off the wings of the other\r\ndrones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12.—THE QUALITIES OF HONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the hive they construct for their future sovereign\r\na palatial abode,[32] spacious and grand, separated from the rest,\r\nand surmounted by a sort of dome: if this prominence should happen\r\nto be flattened, all hopes of progeny are lost. All the cells are\r\nhexagonal, each foot[33] having formed its own side. No part of this\r\nwork, however, is done at any stated time, as the bees seize every\r\nopportunity for the performance of their task when the days are fine;\r\nin one or two days, at most, they fill their cells with honey.\r\n\r\n(12.) This substance is engendered from the air,[34] mostly at the\r\nrising of the constellations, and more especially when Sirius is\r\nshining; never, however, before the rising of the Vergiliæ, and then\r\njust before day-break. Hence it is, that at early dawn the leaves of\r\nthe trees are found covered with a kind of honey-like dew, and those\r\nwho go into the open air at an early hour in the morning, find their\r\nclothes covered, and their hair matted, with a sort of unctuous liquid.\r\nWhether it is that this liquid is the sweat of the heavens, or whether\r\na saliva emanating from the stars, or a juice exuding from the air\r\nwhile purifying itself, would that it had been, when it comes to us,\r\npure, limpid, and genuine, as it was, when first it took its downward\r\ndescent. But as it is, falling from so vast a height, attracting\r\ncorruption in its passage, and tainted by the exhalations of the earth\r\nas it meets them, sucked, too, as it is from off the trees and the\r\nherbage of the fields, and accumulated in the stomachs of the bees—for\r\nthey cast it up again through the mouth—deteriorated besides by the\r\njuices of flowers, and then steeped within the hives and subjected to\r\nsuch repeated changes—still, in spite of all this, it affords us by\r\nits flavour a most exquisite pleasure, the result, no doubt, of its\r\næthereal nature and origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13. (13.)—WHERE THE BEST HONEY IS PRODUCED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe honey is always best in those countries where it is to be found\r\ndeposited in the calix of the most exquisite flowers, such, for\r\ninstance, as the districts of Hymettus and Hybla, in Attica and Sicily\r\nrespectively, and after them the island of Calydna.[35] At first,\r\nhoney is thin, like water, after which it effervesces for some days,\r\nand purifies itself like must. On the twentieth day it begins to\r\nthicken, and soon after becomes covered with a thin membrane, which\r\ngradually increases through the scum which is thrown up by the heat.\r\nThe honey of the very finest flavour, and the least tainted by the\r\nleaves of trees, is that gathered from the foliage of the oak and the\r\nlinden, and from reeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (14.)—THE KINDS OF HONEY PECULIAR TO VARIOUS PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peculiar excellence of honey depends, as already stated,[36] on\r\nthe country in which it is produced; the modes, too, of estimating\r\nits quality are numerous. In some countries we find the honey-comb\r\nremarkable for the goodness of the wax, as in Sicily, for instance, and\r\nthe country of the Peligni; in other places the honey itself is found\r\nin greater abundance, as in Crete, Cyprus, and Africa; and in others,\r\nagain, the comb is remarkable for its size; the northern climates, for\r\ninstance, for in Germany a comb has been known to be as much as eight\r\nfeet in length, and quite black on the concave surface.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the country in which it may happen to have been produced,\r\nthere are three different kinds of honey.—Spring honey[37] is that\r\nmade in a comb which has been constructed of flowers, from which\r\ncircumstance it has received the name of _anthinum_. There are some\r\npersons who say that this should not be touched, because the more\r\nabundant the nutriment, the stronger will be the coming swarm; while\r\nothers, again, leave less of this honey than of any other for the bees,\r\non the ground that there is sure to be a vast abundance at the rising\r\nof the greater constellations, as well as at the summer solstice, when\r\nthe thyme and the vine begin to blossom, for then they are sure to find\r\nabundant materials for their cells.\r\n\r\nIn taking the combs the greatest care is always requisite, for when\r\nthey are stinted for food the bees become desperate, and either pine\r\nto death, or else wing their flight to other places: but on the other\r\nhand, over-abundance will entail idleness, and then they will feed\r\nupon the honey, and not the bee-bread. Hence it is that the most\r\ncareful breeders take care to leave the bees a fifteenth part of this\r\ngathering. There is a certain day for beginning the honey-gathering,\r\nfixed, as it were, by a law of Nature, if men would only understand or\r\nobserve it, being the thirtieth day after the bees have swarmed and\r\ncome forth. This gathering mostly takes place before the end of May.\r\n\r\nThe second kind of honey is “summer honey,” which, from the\r\ncircumstance of its being produced at the most favourable season, has\r\nreceived the Greek name of _horaion_;[38] it is generally made during\r\nthe next thirty days after the solstice, while Sirius is shining in all\r\nits brilliancy. Nature has revealed in this substance most remarkable\r\nproperties to mortals, were it not that the fraudulent propensities of\r\nman are apt to falsify and corrupt everything. For, after the rising of\r\neach constellation, and those of the highest rank more particularly, or\r\nafter the appearance of the rainbow, if a shower does not ensue, but\r\nthe dew becomes warmed by the sun’s rays, a medicament, and not real\r\nhoney, is produced; a gift sent from heaven for the cure of diseases\r\nof the eyes, ulcers, and maladies of the internal viscera. If this is\r\ntaken at the rising of Sirius, and the rising of Venus, Jupiter, or\r\nMercury should happen to fall on the same day, as often is the case,\r\nthe sweetness of this substance, and the virtue which it possesses of\r\nrestoring men to life, are not inferior to those attributed to the\r\nnectar of the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15. (15.)—HOW HONEY IS TESTED. ERICÆUM. TETRALIX, OR SISIRUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crop of honey is most abundant if gathered at full moon, and\r\nit is richest when the weather is fine. In all honey, that which\r\nflows of itself, like must or oil, has received from us the name of\r\n_acetum_.[39] The summer honey is the most esteemed of all, from the\r\nfact of its being made when the weather is driest: it is looked upon as\r\nthe most serviceable when made from thyme;[40] it is then of a golden\r\ncolour, and of a most delicious flavour. The honey that we see formed\r\nin the calix of flowers is of a rich and unctuous nature; that which\r\nis made from rosemary is thick, while that which is candied is little\r\nesteemed. Thyme honey does not coagulate, and on being touched will\r\ndraw out into thin viscous threads, a thing which is the principal\r\nproof of its heaviness. When honey shows no tenacity, and the drops\r\nimmediately part from one another, it is looked upon as a sign of its\r\nworthlessness. The other proofs of its goodness are the fine aroma\r\nof its smell, its being of a sweetness that closely borders on the\r\nsour,[41] and being glutinous and pellucid.\r\n\r\nCassius Dionysius is of opinion that in the summer gathering the\r\ntenth part of the honey ought to be left for the bees if the hives\r\nshould happen to be well filled, and even if not, still in the same\r\nproportion; while, on the other hand, if there is but little in them,\r\nhe recommends that it should not be touched at all. The people of\r\nAttica have fixed the period for commencing this gathering at the first\r\nripening of the wild fig; others[42] have made it the day that is\r\nsacred to Vulcan.[43]\r\n\r\n(16.) The third kind of honey, which is the least esteemed of all, is\r\nthe wild honey, known by the name of _ericæum_.[44] It is collected by\r\nthe bees after the first showers of autumn, when the heather[45] alone\r\nis blooming in the woods, from which circumstance it derives its sandy\r\nappearance. It is mostly produced at the rising of Arcturus, beginning\r\nat the day[46] before the ides of September. Some persons delay the\r\ngathering of the summer honey until the rising of Arcturus, because\r\nfrom then till the autumnal equinox there are fourteen days left, and\r\nit is from the equinox till the setting of the Vergiliæ, a period\r\nof forty-eight days, that the heather is in the greatest abundance.\r\nThe Athenians call this plant by the name of _tetralix_,[47] and the\r\nEubœans _sisirum_, and they look upon it as affording great pleasure to\r\nthe bees to browse upon, probably because there are no other flowers\r\nfor them to resort to. This gathering terminates at the end of the\r\nvintage and the setting of the Vergiliæ, mostly about the ides of\r\nNovember.[48] Experience teaches us that we ought to leave for the bees\r\ntwo-thirds of this crop, and always that part of the combs as well,\r\nwhich contains the bee-bread.\r\n\r\nFrom the winter solstice to the rising of Arcturus the bees are buried\r\nin sleep for sixty days, and live without any nourishment. Between the\r\nrising of Arcturus and the vernal equinox, they awake in the warmer\r\nclimates, but even then they still keep within the hives, and have\r\nrecourse to the provisions kept in reserve for this period. In Italy,\r\nhowever, they do this immediately after the rising of the Vergiliæ,\r\nup to which period they are asleep. Some persons, when they take the\r\nhoney, weigh the hive and all, and remove just as much as they leave:\r\na due sense of equity should always be stringently observed in dealing\r\nwith them, and it is generally stated that if imposed upon in this\r\ndivision, the swarm will die of grief. It is particularly recommended\r\nalso that the person who takes the honey should be well washed\r\nand clean: bees have a particular aversion, too, to a thief and a\r\nmenstruous woman. When the honey is taken, it is the best plan to drive\r\naway the bees by means of smoke, lest they should become irritated, or\r\nelse devour the honey themselves. By often applying smoke, too, they\r\nare aroused from their idleness to work; but if they have not duly\r\nincubated in the comb, it is apt to become of a livid colour. On the\r\nother hand, if they are smoked too often, they will become tainted;\r\nthe honey, too, a substance which turns sour at the very slightest\r\ncontact with dew, will very quickly receive injury from the taint thus\r\ncontracted: hence it is that among the various kinds of honey which are\r\npreserved, there is one which is known by the name of _acapnon_.[49]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—THE REPRODUCTION OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow bees generate their young has been a subject of great and subtle\r\nresearch among the learned; seeing that no one has ever witnessed[50]\r\nany sexual intercourse among these insects. Many persons have\r\nexpressed an opinion that they must be produced from flowers, aptly\r\nand artistically arranged by Nature; while others, again, suppose that\r\nthey are produced from an intercourse with the one which is to be found\r\nin every swarm, and is usually called the king. This one, they say, is\r\nthe only male[51] in the hive, and is endowed with such extraordinary\r\nproportions, that it may not become exhausted in the performance of\r\nits duties. Hence it is, that no offspring can be produced without it,\r\nall the other bees being females,[52] and attending it in its capacity\r\nof a male, and not as their leader. This opinion, however, which is\r\notherwise not improbable, is sufficiently refuted by the generation of\r\nthe drones. For on what grounds could it possibly happen that the same\r\nintercourse should produce an offspring part of which is perfect, and\r\npart in an imperfect state? The first surmise which I have mentioned\r\nwould appear, indeed, to be much nearer the truth, were it not the\r\ncase that here another difficulty meets us—the circumstance that\r\nsometimes, at the extremity of the combs, there are produced bees of\r\na larger size, which put the others to flight. This noxious bee bears\r\nthe name of _œstrus_,[53] and how is it possible that it should ever\r\nbe produced, if it is the fact that the bees themselves form their\r\nprogeny?[54]\r\n\r\nA fact, however, that is well ascertained, is, that bees sit,[55] like\r\nthe domestic fowl, that which is hatched by them at first having\r\nthe appearance of a white maggot, and lying across and adhering so\r\ntenaciously to the wax as to seem to be part of it. The king, however,\r\nfrom the earliest moment, is of the colour of honey, just as though he\r\nwere made of the choicest flowers, nor has he at any time the form of\r\na grub, but from the very first is provided with wings.[56] The rest\r\nof the bees, as soon as they begin to assume a shape, have the name of\r\n_nymphæ_,[57] while the drones are called _sirenes_, or _cephenes_. If\r\na person takes off the head of either kind before the wings are formed,\r\nthe rest of the body is considered a most choice morsel by the parents.\r\nIn process of time the parent bees instil nutriment into them, and\r\nsit upon them, making on this occasion a loud humming noise, for the\r\npurpose, it is generally supposed, of generating that warmth which is\r\nso requisite for hatching the young. At length the membrane in which\r\neach of them is enveloped, as though it lay in an egg, bursts asunder,\r\nand the whole swarm comes to light.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance was witnessed at the suburban retreat of a man of\r\nconsular dignity near Rome, whose hives were made of transparent\r\nlantern horn: the young were found to be developed in the space of\r\nforty-five days. In some combs, there is found what is known by the\r\nname of “nail” wax;[58] it is bitter and hard, and is only met with\r\nwhen the bees have failed to hatch their young, either from disease\r\nor a natural sterility, it is the abortion, in fact, of the bees. The\r\nyoung ones, the moment they are hatched, commence working with their\r\nparents, as though in a course of training, and the newly-born king is\r\naccompanied by a multitude of his own age.\r\n\r\nThat the supply may not run short, each swarm rears several kings; but\r\nafterwards, when this progeny begins to arrive at a mature age, with\r\none accord[59] they put to death the inferior ones, lest they should\r\ncreate discord in the swarm.[60] There are two sorts of king bees;\r\nthose of a reddish colour are better than the black and mottled ones.\r\nThe kings have always a peculiar form of their own, and are double the\r\nsize of any of the rest; their wings are shorter[61] than those of the\r\nothers, their legs are straight, their walk more upright, and they have\r\na white spot on the forehead, which bears some resemblance to a diadem:\r\nthey differ, too, very much from the rest of the community, in their\r\nbright and shining appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (17.)—THE MODE OF GOVERNMENT OF THE BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet a man employ himself, forsooth, in the enquiry whether there has\r\nbeen only one Hercules, how many fathers Liber there have been, and all\r\nthe other questions which are buried deep in the mould of antiquity!\r\nHere behold a tiny object, one to be met with at most of our country\r\nretreats, and numbers of which are always at hand, and yet, after all,\r\nit is not agreed among authors whether or not the king[62] is the only\r\none among them that is provided with no sting, and is possessed of no\r\nother arms than those afforded him by his majestic office, or whether\r\nNature has granted him a sting, and has only denied him the power of\r\nmaking use of it; it being a well-known fact, that the ruling bee\r\nnever does use a sting. The obedience which his subjects manifest in\r\nhis presence is quite surprising. When he goes forth, the whole swarm\r\nattends him, throngs about him, surrounds him, protects him, and will\r\nnot allow him to be seen. At other times, when the swarm is at work\r\nwithin, the king is seen to visit the works, and appears to be giving\r\nhis encouragement, being himself the only one that is exempt from work:\r\naround him are certain other bees which act as body-guards and lictors,\r\nthe careful guardians of his authority. The king never quits the hive\r\nexcept when the swarm is about to depart; a thing which may be known\r\na long time beforehand, as for some days a peculiar buzzing noise is\r\nto be heard within, which denotes that the bees are waiting for a\r\nfavourable day, and making all due preparations for their departure. On\r\nsuch an occasion, if care is taken to deprive the king of one of his\r\nwings, the swarm will not fly away. When they are on the wing, every\r\none is anxious to be near him, and takes a pleasure in being seen in\r\nthe performance of its duty. When he is weary, they support him on\r\ntheir shoulders; and when he is quite tired, they carry him outright.\r\nIf one of them falls in the rear from weariness, or happens to go\r\nastray, it is able to follow the others by the aid of its acuteness\r\nof smell. Wherever the king bee happens to settle, that becomes the\r\nencampment of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—HAPPY OMENS SOMETIMES AFFORDED BY A SWARM OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, it is that they afford presages both of private and\r\npublic interest, clustering, as they do, like a bunch of grapes, upon\r\nhouses or temples; presages, in fact, that are often accounted for by\r\ngreat events. Bees settled upon the lips of Plato when still an infant\r\neven, announcing thereby the sweetness of that persuasive eloquence for\r\nwhich he was so noted. Bees settled, too, in the camp of the chieftain\r\nDrusus when he gained the brilliant victory at Arbalo;[63] a proof,\r\nindeed, that the conjectures of soothsayers are not by any means\r\ninfallible, seeing that they are of opinion that this is always of evil\r\naugury. When their leader is withheld from them, the swarm can always\r\nbe detained; and when lost, it will disperse and take its departure to\r\nfind other kings. Without a king, in fact, they cannot exist, and it\r\nis with the greatest reluctance that they put them to death when there\r\nare several; they prefer, too, to destroy the cells of the young ones,\r\nif they find reason to despair of providing food; in such case they\r\nthen expel the drones. And yet, with regard to the last, I find that\r\nsome doubts are entertained; and that there are some authors who are\r\nof opinion that they form a peculiar species, like that bee, the very\r\nlargest among them all, which is known by the name of the “thief,”[64]\r\nbecause it furtively devours the honey; it is distinguished by its\r\nblack colour and the largeness of its body. It is a well-known fact,\r\nhowever, that the bees are in the habit of killing the drones. These\r\nlast have no king of their own; but how it is that they are produced\r\nwithout a sting, is a matter still undetermined.\r\n\r\nIn a wet spring the young swarms are more numerous; in a dry one the\r\nhoney is most abundant. If food happens to fail the inhabitants of any\r\nparticular hive, the swarm makes a concerted attack upon a neighbouring\r\none, with the view of plundering it. The swarm that is thus attacked,\r\nat once ranges itself in battle array, and if the bee-keeper should\r\nhappen to be present, that side which perceives itself favoured by\r\nhim will refrain from attacking him. They often fight, too, for other\r\nreasons as well, and the two generals are to be seen drawing up their\r\nranks in battle array against their opponents. The dispute generally\r\narises in culling from the flowers, when each, the moment that it is\r\nin danger, summons its companions to its aid. The battle, however, is\r\nimmediately put an end to by throwing dust[65] among them, or raising\r\na smoke; and if milk or honey mixed with water is placed before them,\r\nthey speedily become reconciled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (18.)—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are field bees also, and wild bees, ungainly in appearance,\r\nand much more irascible than the others, but remarkable for their\r\nlaboriousness and the excellence of their work. Of domestic bees there\r\nare two sorts; the best are those with short bodies, speckled all over,\r\nand of a compact round shape. Those that are long, and resemble the\r\nwasp in appearance, are an inferior kind; and of these last, the very\r\nworst of all are those which have the body covered with hair. In Pontus\r\nthere is a kind of white bee, which makes honey twice a month. On the\r\nbanks of the river Thermodon there are two kinds found, one of which\r\nmakes honey in the trees, the other under ground: they form a triple\r\nrow of combs, and produce honey in the greatest abundance.\r\n\r\nNature has provided bees with a sting, which is inserted in the abdomen\r\nof the insect. There are some who think that at the first blow which\r\nthey inflict with this weapon they will instantly die,[66] while\r\nothers, again, are of opinion that such is not the case, unless the\r\nanimal drives it so deep as to cause a portion of the intestines to\r\nfollow; and they assert, also, that after they have thus lost their\r\nsting they become drones,[67] and make no honey, being thus castrated,\r\nso to say, and equally incapable of inflicting injury, and of making\r\nthemselves useful by their labours. We have instances stated of horses\r\nbeing killed by bees.\r\n\r\nThey have a great aversion to bad smells, and fly away from them; a\r\ndislike which extends to artificial perfumes even. Hence it is that\r\nthey will attack persons who smell of unguents. They themselves, also,\r\nare exposed to the attacks of wasps and hornets, which belong to the\r\nsame class, but are of a degenerate[68] nature; these wage continual\r\nwarfare against them, as also does a species of gnat, which is known by\r\nthe name of “mulio;”[69] swallows, too, and various other birds prey\r\nupon them. Frogs lie in wait for them when in quest of water, which,\r\nin fact, is their principal occupation at the time they are rearing\r\ntheir young. And it is not only the frog that frequents ponds and\r\nstreams that is thus injurious to them, but the bramble-frog as well,\r\nwhich will come to the hives even in search of them, and, crawling up\r\nto the entrance, breathe through the apertures; upon hearing which, a\r\nbee flies to the spot, and is snapped up in an instant. It is generally\r\nstated that frogs are proof against the sting of the bee. Sheep, too,\r\nare peculiarly dangerous to them, as they have the greatest difficulty\r\nin extricating themselves from the fleece. The smell of crabs,[70] if\r\nthey happen to be cooked in their vicinity, is fatal to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—THE DISEASES OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBees are also by nature liable to certain diseases of their own. The\r\nsign that they are diseased, is a kind of torpid, moping sadness: on\r\nsuch occasions, they are to be seen bringing out those that are sick\r\nbefore the hives, and placing them in the warm sun, while others,\r\nagain, are providing them with food. Those that are dead they carry\r\naway from the hive, and attend the bodies, paying their last duties, as\r\nit were, in funeral procession. If the king should happen to be carried\r\noff by the pestilence, the swarm remains plunged in grief and listless\r\ninactivity; it collects no more food, and ceases to issue forth from\r\nits abode; the only thing that it does is to gather around the body,\r\nand to emit a melancholy humming noise. Upon such occasions, the usual\r\nplan is to disperse the swarm and take away the body; for otherwise\r\nthey would continue listlessly gazing upon it, and so prolong their\r\ngrief. Indeed, if due care is not taken to come to their aid, they will\r\ndie of hunger. It is from their cheerfulness, in fact, and their bright\r\nand sleek appearance that we usually form an estimate as to their\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n(19) There are certain maladies, also, which affect their productions;\r\nwhen they do not fill their combs, the disease under which they are\r\nlabouring is known by the name of _claros_,[71] and if they fail to\r\nrear their young, they are suffering from the effects of that known as\r\n_blapsigonia_.[72]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—THINGS THAT ARE NOXIOUS TO BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEcho, or the noise made by the reverberation of the air, is also\r\ninjurious to bees, as it dismays them by its redoubled sounds; fogs,\r\nalso, are noxious to them. Spiders, too, are especially hostile to\r\nbees; when they have gone so far as to build their webs within the\r\nhive, the death of the whole swarm is the result. The common and\r\nignoble moth,[73] too, that is to be seen fluttering about a burning\r\ncandle, is deadly to them, and that in more ways than one. It devours\r\nthe wax, and leaves its ordure behind it, from which the maggot known\r\nto us as the “teredo” is produced; besides which, wherever it goes, it\r\ndrops the down from off its wings, and thereby thickens the threads of\r\nthe cobwebs. The teredo is also engendered in the wood of the hive,\r\nand then it proves especially destructive to the wax. Bees are the\r\nvictims, also, of their own greediness, for when they glut themselves\r\novermuch with the juices of the flowers, in the spring season more\r\nparticularly, they are troubled with flux and looseness. Olive oil is\r\nfatal[74] to not only bees, but all other insects as well, and more\r\nespecially if they are placed in the sun, after the head has been\r\nimmersed in it. Sometimes, too, they themselves are the cause of their\r\nown destruction; as, for instance, when they see preparations being\r\nmade for taking their honey, and immediately fall to devouring it with\r\nthe greatest avidity. In other respects they are remarkable for their\r\nabstemiousness, and they will expel those that are inclined to be\r\nprodigal and voracious, no less than those that are sluggish and idle.\r\nTheir own honey even may be productive of injury to them; for if they\r\nare smeared with it on the fore-part of the body, it is fatal to them.\r\nSuch are the enemies, so numerous are the accidents—and how small a\r\nportion of them have I here enumerated!—to which a creature that proves\r\nso bountiful to us is exposed. In the appropriate place[75] we will\r\ntreat of the proper remedies; for the present the nature of them is our\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (20.)—HOW TO KEEP BEES TO THE HIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clapping of the hands and the tinkling of brass afford bees great\r\ndelight, and it is by these means that they are brought together; a\r\nstrong proof, in fact, that they are possessed of the sense of hearing.\r\nWhen their work is completed, their offspring brought forth, and all\r\ntheir duties fulfilled, they still have certain formal exercises to\r\nperform, ranging abroad throughout the country, and soaring aloft in\r\nthe air, wheeling round and round as they fly, and then, when the hour\r\nfor taking their food has come, returning home. The extreme period of\r\ntheir life, supposing that they escape accident and the attacks of\r\ntheir enemies, is only seven years; a hive, it is said, never lasts\r\nmore than ten.[76] There are some persons, who think that, when dead,\r\nif they are preserved in the house throughout the winter, and then\r\nexposed to the warmth of the spring sun, and kept hot all day in the\r\nashes of fig-tree wood, they will come to life again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—METHODS OF RENEWING THE SWARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese persons say also, that if the swarm is entirely lost, it may be\r\nreplaced by the aid of the belly[77] of an ox newly killed, covered\r\nover with dung. Virgil also says[78] that this may be done with the\r\nbody of a young bull, in the same way that the carcase of the horse\r\nproduces wasps and hornets, and that of the ass beetles, Nature herself\r\neffecting these changes of one substance into another. But in all\r\nthese last, sexual intercourse is to be perceived as well, though the\r\ncharacteristics of the offspring are pretty much the same as those of\r\nthe bee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24. (21.)—WASPS AND HORNETS: ANIMALS WHICH APPROPRIATE WHAT\r\nBELONGS TO OTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWasps build their nests of mud in lofty places,[79] and make wax\r\ntherein: hornets, on the other hand, build in holes or under ground.\r\nWith these two kinds the cells are also hexagonal, but, in other\r\nrespects, though made of the bark of trees, they strongly resemble the\r\nsubstance of a spider’s web. Their young also are found at irregular\r\nintervals, and are of unshapely appearance; while one is able to fly,\r\nanother is still a mere pupa, and a third only in the maggot state.\r\nIt is in the autumn, too, and not in the spring, that all their young\r\nare produced; and they grow during the full moon more particularly.\r\nThe wasp which is known as the ichneumon,[80] a smaller kind than\r\nthe others, kills one kind of spider in particular, known as the\r\nphalangium; after which it carries the body to its nest, covers it over\r\nwith a sort of gluey substance, and then sits and hatches from it its\r\nyoung.[81] In addition to this, they are all of them carnivorous, while\r\non the other hand bees will touch no animal substance whatever. Wasps\r\nmore particularly pursue the larger flies, and after catching them cut\r\noff the head and carry away the remaining portion of the body.\r\n\r\nWild hornets live in the holes of trees, and in winter, like other\r\ninsects, keep themselves concealed; their life does not exceed two\r\nyears in length. It is not unfrequently that their sting is productive\r\nof an attack of fever, and there are authors who say that thrice nine\r\nstings will suffice to kill a man. Of the other hornets, which seem\r\nnot to be so noxious, there are two kinds; the working ones, which\r\nare smaller in size and die in the winter; and the parent hornets,\r\nwhich live two years; these last, indeed, are quite harmless.[82] In\r\nspring they build their nests, which have generally four entrances,\r\nand here it is that the working hornets are produced: after these\r\nhave been hatched they form other nests of larger size, in which to\r\nbring forth the parents of the future generation. From this time the\r\nworking hornets begin to follow their vocation, and apply themselves to\r\nsupplying the others with food. The parent hornets are of larger size\r\nthan the others, and it is very doubtful whether they have a sting, as\r\nit is never to be seen protruded. These races, too, have their drones.\r\nSome persons are of opinion that all these insects lose their stings\r\nin the winter. Neither hornets nor wasps have a king, nor do they\r\never congregate in swarms; but their numbers are recruited by fresh\r\noffspring from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25. (22.)—THE BOMBYX OF ASSYRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fourth class of this kind[83] of insect is the bombyx,[84] which is a\r\nnative of Assyria, and is of larger size than any of those which have\r\nbeen previously mentioned. They construct their nests of a kind of mud\r\nwhich has the appearance of salt, and then fasten them to a stone,\r\nwhere they become so hard, that it is scarcely possible to penetrate\r\nthem with a dart even. In these nests they make wax, in larger\r\nquantities than bees, and the grub which they then produce is larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—THE LARVÆ OF THE SILK-WORM—WHO FIRST INVENTED SILK CLOTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another class also of these insects produced in quite a\r\ndifferent manner. These last spring from a grub of larger size, with\r\ntwo horns of very peculiar appearance. The larva then becomes a\r\ncaterpillar, after which it assumes the state in which it is known\r\nas _bombylis_, then that called _necydalus_, and after that, in six\r\nmonths, it becomes a silk-worm.[85] These insects weave webs similar\r\nto those of the spider, the material of which is used for making the\r\nmore costly and luxurious garments of females, known as “bombycina.”\r\nPamphile, a woman of Cos,[86] the daughter of Platea, was the first[87]\r\nperson who discovered the art of unravelling these webs and spinning a\r\ntissue therefrom; indeed, she ought not to be deprived of the glory of\r\nhaving discovered the art of making vestments which, while they cover a\r\nwoman, at the same moment reveal her naked charms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27. (23.)—THE SILK-WORM OF COS—HOW THE COAN VESTMENTS ARE MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silk-worm, too, is said to be a native of the isle of Cos, where\r\nthe vapours of the earth give new life to the flowers of the cypress,\r\nthe terebinth, the ash, and the oak which have been beaten down by\r\nthe showers. At first they assume the appearance of small butterflies\r\nwith naked bodies, but soon after, being unable to endure the cold,\r\nthey throw out bristly hairs, and assume quite a thick coat against\r\nthe winter, by rubbing off the down that covers the leaves, by the\r\naid of the roughness of their feet. This they compress into balls by\r\ncarding it with their claws, and then draw it out and hang it between\r\nthe branches of the trees, making it fine by combing it out as it were:\r\nlast of all, they take and roll it round their body, thus forming a\r\nnest in which they are enveloped. It is in this state that they are\r\ntaken; after which they are placed in earthen vessels in a warm place,\r\nand fed upon bran. A peculiar sort of down soon shoots forth upon the\r\nbody, on being clothed with which they are sent to work upon another\r\ntask. The cocoons[88] which they have begun to form are rendered soft\r\nand pliable by the aid of water, and are then drawn out into threads\r\nby means of a spindle made of a reed. Nor, in fact, have the men even\r\nfelt ashamed to make use[89] of garments formed of this material, in\r\nconsequence of their extreme lightness in summer: for, so greatly have\r\nmanners degenerated in our day, that, so far from wearing a cuirass,\r\na garment even is found to be too heavy. The produce of the Assyrian\r\nsilk-worm, however, we have till now left to the women only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28. (24.)—SPIDERS; THE KINDS THAT MAKE WEBS; THE MATERIALS USED\r\nBY THEM IN SO DOING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is by no means an absurdity to append to the silk-worm an account\r\nof the spider, a creature which is worthy of our especial admiration.\r\nThere are numerous kinds of spiders, however, which it will not be\r\nnecessary here to mention, from the fact of their being so well known.\r\nThose that bear the name of _phalangium_ are of small size, with bodies\r\nspotted and running to a point; their bite is venomous, and they leap\r\nas they move from place to place. Another kind, again, is black, and\r\nthe fore-legs are remarkable for their length. They have all of them\r\nthree joints in the legs. The smaller kind of wolf-spider[90] does not\r\nmake a web, but the larger ones make their holes in the earth, and\r\nspread their nets at the narrow entrance thereof. A third kind, again,\r\nis remarkable for the skill which it displays in its operations. These\r\nspin a large web, and the abdomen suffices to supply the material\r\nfor so extensive a work, whether it is that, at stated periods the\r\nexcrements are largely secreted in the abdomen, as Democritus thinks,\r\nor that the creature has in itself a certain faculty of secreting[91]\r\na peculiar sort of woolly substance. How steadily does it work with\r\nits claws, how beautifully rounded and how equal are the threads as it\r\nforms its web, while it employs the weight of its body as an equipoise!\r\nIt begins at the middle to weave its web, and then extends it by adding\r\nthe threads in rings around, like a warp upon the woof: forming the\r\nmeshes at equal intervals, but continually enlarging them as the web\r\nincreases in breadth, it finally unites them all by an indissoluble\r\nknot. With what wondrous art does it conceal the snares that lie in\r\nwait for its prey in its checkered nettings! How little, too, would it\r\nseem that there is any such trap laid in the compactness of its web\r\nand the tenacious texture of the woof, which would appear of itself\r\nto be finished and arranged by the exercise of the very highest art!\r\nHow loose, too, is the body of the web as it yields to the blasts,\r\nand how readily does it catch all objects which come in its way! You\r\nwould fancy that it had left, quite exhausted, the thrums of the upper\r\nportion of its net unfinished where they are spread across; it is with\r\nthe greatest difficulty that they are to be perceived, and yet the\r\nmoment that an object touches them, like the lines of the hunter’s\r\nnet, they throw it into the body of the web. With what architectural\r\nskill, too, is its hole arched over, and how well defended by a nap of\r\nextra thickness against the cold! How carefully, too, it retires into a\r\ncorner, and appears intent upon anything but what it really is, all the\r\nwhile that it is so carefully shut up from view, that it is impossible\r\nto perceive whether there is anything within or not! And then too, how\r\nextraordinary the strength of the web! When is the wind ever known to\r\nbreak it, or what accumulation of dust is able to weigh it down?\r\n\r\nThe spider often spreads its web right across between two trees, when\r\nplying its art and learning how to spin; and then, as to its length,\r\nthe thread extends from the very top of the tree to the ground, while\r\nthe insect springs up again in an instant from the earth, and travels\r\naloft by the very self-same thread, thus mounting at the same moment\r\nand spinning its threads. When its prey falls into its net, how on the\r\nalert it is, and with what readiness it runs to seize it! Even though\r\nit should be adhering to the very edge of its web, the insect always\r\nruns instantly to the middle, as it is by these means that it can most\r\neffectually shake the web, and so successfully entangle its prey. When\r\nthe web is torn, the spider immediately sets about repairing it, and\r\nthat so neatly, that nothing like patching can ever be seen. The spider\r\nlies in wait even for the young of the lizard, and after enveloping the\r\nhead of the animal, bites its lips; a sight by no means unworthy of\r\nthe amphitheatre itself, when it is one’s good fortune to witness it.\r\nPresages also are drawn from the spider; for when a river is about to\r\nswell, it will suspend its web higher than usual. In calm weather these\r\ninsects do not spin, but when it is cloudy they do, and hence it is,\r\nthat a great number of cobwebs is a sure sign of showery weather. It\r\nis generally supposed that it is the female spider that spins, and the\r\nmale that lies in wait for prey, thus making an equal division of their\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—THE GENERATION OF SPIDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpiders couple[92] backwards, and produce maggots like eggs; for I\r\nought not to defer making some mention of this subject, seeing, in\r\nfact, that of most insects there is hardly anything else to be said.\r\nAll these eggs they lay in their webs, but scattered about, as they\r\nleap from place to place while laying them. The phalangium is the only\r\nspider that lays a considerable number of them, in a hole; and as\r\nsoon as ever the progeny is hatched it devours its mother, and very\r\noften the male parent as well, for that, too, aids in the process of\r\nincubation. These last produce as many as three hundred eggs, the\r\nothers a smaller number. Spiders take three days to hatch their eggs.\r\nThey come to their full growth in twenty-eight days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30. (25.)—SCORPIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner to the spider, the land scorpion also produces\r\nmaggots[93] similar to eggs, and dies in a similar manner. This animal\r\nis a dangerous scourge, and has a venom like that of the serpent; with\r\nthe exception that its effects are far more[94] painful, as the person\r\nwho is stung will linger for three days before death ensues. The sting\r\nis invariably fatal to virgins, and nearly always so to matrons. It is\r\nso to men also, in the morning, when the animal has issued from its\r\nhole in a fasting state, and has not yet happened to discharge its\r\npoison by any accidental stroke. The tail is always ready to strike,\r\nand ceases not for an instant to menace, so that no opportunity may\r\npossibly be missed. The animal strikes too with a sidelong blow, or\r\nelse by turning the tail upwards. Apollodorus informs us, that the\r\npoison which they secrete is of a white colour, and he has divided\r\nthem into nine classes, distinguished mostly by their colours—to very\r\nlittle purpose, however, for it is impossible to understand which among\r\nthese it is that he has pronounced to be the least dangerous. He says,\r\nalso, that some of them have a double sting, and that the males—for he\r\nasserts that they are engendered by the union of the sexes—are the most\r\ndangerous. These may easily be known, he says, by their slender form\r\nand greater length. He states, also, that they all of them have venom\r\nin the middle of the day, when they have been warmed by the heat of the\r\nsun, as, also, when they are thirsty—their thirst, indeed, can never be\r\nquenched. It is an ascertained fact, that those which have seven joints\r\nin the tail are the most[95] deadly; the greater part, however, have\r\nbut six.\r\n\r\nFor this pest of Africa, the southern winds have provided means of\r\nflight as well, for as the breeze bears them along, they extend\r\ntheir arms and ply them like so many oars in their flight; the same\r\nApollodorus, however, asserts that there are some which really have\r\nwings.[96] The Psylli, who for their own profit have been in the habit\r\nof importing the poisons of other lands among us, and have thus filled\r\nItaly with the pests which belong to other regions, have made attempts\r\nto import the flying scorpion as well, but it has been found that\r\nit cannot live further north than the latitude of Sicily. However,\r\nthey[97] are sometimes to be seen in Italy, but are quite harmless\r\nthere; they are found, also, in many other places, the vicinity of\r\nPharos, in Egypt, for instance. In Scythia, the scorpion is able to\r\nkill the swine even with its sting, an animal which, in general, is\r\nproof against poisons of this kind in a remarkable degree. When stung,\r\nthose swine which are black die more speedily than others, and more\r\nparticularly if they happen to throw themselves into the water. When a\r\nperson has been stung, it is generally supposed that he may be cured\r\nby drinking the ashes of the scorpion[98] mixed with wine. It is the\r\nbelief also that there is nothing more baneful to the scorpion and\r\nthe stellio,[99] than to dip them in oil. This last animal is also\r\ndangerous to all other creatures, except those which, like itself,\r\nare destitute of blood: in figure it strongly resembles the common\r\nlizard. For the most part, also, the scorpion does no injury to any\r\nanimal which is bloodless. Some writers, too, are of opinion that the\r\nscorpion devours its offspring, and that the one among the young which\r\nis the most adroit avails itself of its sole mode of escape, by placing\r\nitself on the back of the mother, and thus finding a place where it is\r\nin safety from the tail and the sting. The one that thus escapes, they\r\nsay, becomes the avenger of the rest, and at last, taking advantage of\r\nits elevated position, puts its parents to death. The scorpion produces\r\neleven at a birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31. (26.)—THE STELLIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stellio[100] has in some measure the same nature as the chameleon,\r\nas it lives upon nothing but dew, and such spiders[101] as it may\r\nhappen to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—THE GRASSHOPPER: THAT IT HAS NEITHER MOUTH NOR OUTLET FOR\r\nFOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cicada[102] also lives in a similar manner, and is divided into\r\ntwo kinds. The smaller kind are born the first and die the last, and\r\nare without a voice. The others are of the flying kind, and have a\r\nnote; there are two sorts, those known as _achetæ_, and the smaller\r\nones called _tettigonia_: these last have the loudest voice. In both of\r\nthese last-mentioned kinds, it is the male that sings, while the female\r\nis silent. There are nations in the east that feed upon these insects,\r\nthe Parthians even, wealthy and affluent as they are. They prefer the\r\nmale before it has had sexual intercourse, and the female after; and\r\nthey take[103] their eggs, which are white. They engender with the\r\nbelly upwards. Upon the back they have a sharp-edged instrument,[104]\r\nby means of which they excavate a hole to breed in, in the ground. The\r\nyoung is, at first, a small maggot in appearance, after which the larva\r\nassumes the form in which it is known as the _tettigometra_.[105] It\r\nbursts its shell about the time of the summer solstice, and then takes\r\nto flight, which always happens in the night. The insect, at first, is\r\nblack and hard.\r\n\r\nThis is the only living creature that has no mouth; though it has\r\nsomething instead which bears a strong resemblance to the tongues of\r\nthose insects which carry a sting in the mouth: this organ is situate\r\nin the breast[106] of the animal, and is employed by it in sucking\r\nup the dew. The corselet itself forms a kind of pipe; and it is by\r\nmeans of this that the achetæ utter their note, as already mentioned.\r\nBeyond this, they have no viscera in the abdomen. When surprised, they\r\nspring upwards, and eject a kind of liquid, which, indeed, is our only\r\nproof that they live upon dew. This, also, is the only animal that\r\nhas no outlet for the evacuations of the body. Their powers of sight\r\nare so bad, that if a person contracts his finger, and then suddenly\r\nextends it close to them, they will come upon it just as though it\r\nwere a leaf. Some authors divide these animals into two kinds, the\r\n“surcularia,”[107] which is the largest, and the “frumentaria,”[108] by\r\nmany known as the “avenaria;”[109] this last makes its appearance just\r\nas the corn is turning dry in the ear.\r\n\r\n(27.) The grasshopper is not a native of countries that are bare of\r\ntrees—hence it is that there are none in the vicinity of the city of\r\nCyrene—nor, in fact, is it produced in champaign countries, or in cool\r\nand shady thickets. They will take to some places much more readily\r\nthan others. In the district of Miletus they are only to be found in\r\nsome few spots; and in Cephallenia, there is a river which runs through\r\nthe country, on one side of which they are not to be found, while on\r\nthe other they exist in vast numbers. In the territory of Rhegium,\r\nagain, none of the grasshoppers have any note, while beyond the river,\r\nin the territory of Locri,[110] they sing aloud. Their wings are formed\r\nsimilarly to those of bees, but are larger, in proportion to the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33. (28.)—THE WINGS OF INSECTS.[111]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some insects which have two wings, flies, for instance;\r\nothers, again, have four, like the bee. The wings of the grasshopper\r\nare membranous. Those insects which are armed with a sting in the\r\nabdomen, have four wings. None of those which have a sting in the\r\nmouth, have more than two wings. The former have received the sting for\r\nthe purpose of defending themselves, the latter for the supplying of\r\ntheir wants. If pulled from off the body, the wings of an insect will\r\nnot grow again; no insect which has a sting inserted in its body, has\r\ntwo wings only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—THE BEETLE. THE GLOW-WORM. OTHER KINDS OF BEETLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome insects, for the preservation of their wings, are covered with a\r\ncrust;[112] the beetle, for instance, the wing of which is peculiarly\r\nfine and frail. To these insects a sting has been denied by Nature;\r\nbut in one large kind[113] we find horns of a remarkable length,\r\ntwo-pronged at the extremities, and forming pincers, which the animal\r\ncloses when it is its intention to bite. These beetles are suspended\r\nfrom the neck of infants by way of remedy against certain maladies:\r\nNigidius calls them “lucani.” There is another kind[114] of beetle,\r\nagain, which, as it goes backwards with its feet, rolls the dung into\r\nlarge pellets, and then deposits in them the maggots which form its\r\nyoung, as in a sort of nest, to protect them against the rigours of\r\nwinter. Some, again, fly with a loud buzzing or a drony noise, while\r\nothers[115] burrow numerous holes in the hearths and out in the fields,\r\nand their shrill chirrup is to be heard at night.\r\n\r\nThe glow-worm, by the aid of the colour of its sides[116] and haunches,\r\nsends forth at night a light which resembles that of fire; being\r\nresplendent, at one moment, as it expands its wings,[117] and then\r\nthrown into the shade the instant it has shut them. These insects are\r\nnever to be seen before the grass of the pastures has come to maturity,\r\nnor yet after the hay has been cut. On the other hand, it is the nature\r\nof the black beetle[118] to seek dark corners, and to avoid the light:\r\nit is mostly found in baths, being produced from the humid vapours\r\nwhich arise therefrom. There are some beetles also, belonging to the\r\nsame species, of a golden colour and very large size, which burrow[119]\r\nin dry ground, and construct small combs of a porous nature, and very\r\nlike sponge; these they fill with a poisonous kind of honey. In Thrace,\r\nnear Olynthus, there is a small locality, the only one in which this\r\nanimal cannot exist; from which circumstance it has received the name\r\nof “Cantharolethus.”[120]\r\n\r\nThe wings of all insects are formed without[121] any division in them,\r\nand they none of them have a tail,[122] with the exception of the\r\nscorpion; this, too, is the only one among them that has arms,[123]\r\ntogether with a sting in the tail. As to the rest of the insects, some\r\nof them have the sting in the mouth, the gad-fly for instance, or the\r\n“tabanus,” as some persons choose to call it: the same is the case,\r\ntoo, with the gnat and some kinds of flies. All these insects have\r\ntheir stings situate in the mouth instead[124] of a tongue; but in\r\nsome the sting is not pointed, being formed not for pricking, but for\r\nthe purpose of suction: this is the case more especially with flies,\r\nin which it is clear that the tongue[125] is nothing more than a tube.\r\nThese insects, too, have no teeth. Others, again, have little horns\r\nprotruding in front of the eyes, but without any power in them; the\r\nbutterfly, for instance. Some insects are destitute of wings, such as\r\nthe scolopendra, for instance.[126]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—LOCUSTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose insects which have feet, move sideways. Some of them have the\r\nhind feet longer than the fore ones, and curving outwards, the locust,\r\nfor example.\r\n\r\n(29.) These creatures lay their eggs in large masses, in the autumn,\r\nthrusting the end of the tail into holes which they form in the\r\nground. These eggs remain underground throughout the winter, and in\r\nthe ensuing year, at the close of spring, small locusts issue from\r\nthem, of a black colour, and crawling along without legs[127] and\r\nwings. Hence it is that a wet spring destroys their eggs, while, if it\r\nis dry, they multiply in great abundance. Some persons maintain that\r\nthey breed twice a year, and die the same number of times; that they\r\nbring forth at the rising[128] of the Vergiliæ, and die at the rising\r\nof the Dog-star,[129] after which others spring up in their places:\r\naccording to some, it is at the setting[130] of Arcturus that the\r\nsecond litter is produced. That the mothers die the moment they have\r\nbrought forth, is a well-known fact, for a little worm immediately\r\ngrows about the throat, which chokes them: at the same time, too, the\r\nmales perish as well. This insect, which thus dies through a cause\r\napparently so trifling, is able to kill a serpent by itself, when it\r\npleases, by seizing its jaws with its teeth.[131] Locusts are only\r\nproduced in champaign places, that are full of chinks and crannies. In\r\nIndia, it is said that they attain the length of three[132] feet, and\r\nthat the people dry the legs and thighs, and use them for saws. There\r\nis another mode, also, in which these creatures perish; the winds carry\r\nthem off in vast swarms, upon which they fall into the sea or standing\r\nwaters, and not, as the ancients supposed, because their wings have\r\nbeen drenched by the dampness of the night. The same authors have also\r\nstated, that they are unable to fly during the night, in consequence of\r\nthe cold, being ignorant of the fact, that they travel over lengthened\r\ntracts of sea for many days together, a thing the more to be wondered\r\nat, as they have to endure hunger all the time as well, for this it is\r\nwhich causes them to be thus seeking pastures in other lands. This is\r\nlooked upon as a plague[133] inflicted by the anger of the gods; for as\r\nthey fly they appear to be larger than they really are, while they make\r\nsuch a loud noise with their wings, that they might be readily supposed\r\nto be winged creatures of quite another species. Their numbers, too,\r\nare so vast, that they quite darken the sun; while the people below are\r\nanxiously following them with the eye, to see if they are about to make\r\na descent, and so cover their lands. After all, they have the requisite\r\nenergies for their flight; and, as though it had been but a trifling\r\nmatter to pass over the seas, they cross immense tracts of country, and\r\ncover them in clouds which bode destruction to the harvests. Scorching\r\nnumerous objects by their very contact, they eat away everything with\r\ntheir teeth, the very doors of the houses even.\r\n\r\nThose from Africa are the ones which chiefly devastate Italy; and more\r\nthan once the Roman people have been obliged to have recourse to the\r\nSibylline Books, to learn what remedies to employ under their existing\r\napprehensions of impending famine. In the territory of Cyrenaica[134]\r\nthere is a law, which even compels the people to make war, three times\r\na year, against the locusts, first, by crushing their eggs, next by\r\nkilling the young, and last of all by killing those of full growth;\r\nand he who fails to do so, incurs the penalty of being treated as a\r\ndeserter. In the island of Lemnos also, there is a certain measure\r\nfixed by law, which each individual is bound to fill with locusts which\r\nhe has killed, and then bring it to the magistrates. It is for this\r\nreason, too, that they pay such respect to the jack-daw, which flies\r\nto meet the locusts, and kills them in great numbers. In Syria, also,\r\nthe people are placed under martial law, and compelled to kill them:\r\nin so many countries does this dreadful pest prevail. The Parthians\r\nlook upon them as a choice food,[135] and the grasshopper as well. The\r\nvoice of the locust appears to proceed from the back part of the head.\r\nIt is generally believed that in this place, where the shoulders join\r\non to the body, they have, as it were, a kind of teeth, and that it\r\nis by grinding these against each other that they produce the harsh\r\nnoise which they make. It is more especially about the two equinoxes\r\nthat they are to be heard, in the same way that we hear the chirrup of\r\nthe grasshopper about the summer solstice. The coupling of locusts is\r\nsimilar to that of all other insects that couple, the female supporting\r\nthe male, and turning back the extremity of the tail towards him; it is\r\nonly after a considerable time that they separate. In all these kinds\r\nof insects the male is of smaller size than the female.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36. (30.)—ANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the insects produce a maggot. Ants also produce\r\none in spring, which is similar to an egg,[136] and they work in\r\ncommon, like bees; but whereas the last make their food, the former\r\nonly store[137] it away. If a person only compares the burdens which\r\nthe ants carry with the size of their bodies, he must confess that\r\nthere is no animal which, in proportion, is possessed of a greater\r\ndegree of strength. These burdens they carry with the mouth, but when\r\nit is too large to admit of that, they turn their backs to it, and push\r\nit onwards with their feet, while they use their utmost energies with\r\ntheir shoulders. These insects, also, have a political community among\r\nthemselves, and are possessed of both memory and foresight. They gnaw\r\neach grain before they lay it by, for fear lest it should shoot while\r\nunder ground; those grains, again, which are too large for admission,\r\nthey divide at the entrance of their holes; and those which have become\r\nsoaked by the rain, they bring out and dry.[138] They work, too, by\r\nnight, during the full moon; but when there is no moon, they cease\r\nworking. And then, too, in their labours, what ardour they display,\r\nwhat wondrous carefulness! Because they collect their stores from\r\ndifferent quarters, in ignorance of the proceedings of one another,\r\nthey have certain days set apart for holding a kind of market, on which\r\nthey meet together and take stock.[139] What vast throngs are then to\r\nbe seen hurrying together, what anxious enquiries appear to be made,\r\nand what earnest parleys[140] are going on among them as they meet! We\r\nsee even the very stones worn away by their footsteps, and roads beaten\r\ndown by being the scene of their labours. Let no one be in doubt,\r\nthen, how much assiduity and application, even in the very humblest\r\nof objects, can upon every occasion effect! Ants are the only living\r\nbeings, besides man, that bestow burial on the dead. In Sicily there\r\nare no winged ants to be found.\r\n\r\n(31.) The horns of an Indian ant, suspended in the temple of Hercules,\r\nat Erythræ,[141] have been looked upon as quite miraculous for their\r\nsize. This ant excavates gold from holes, in a country in the north\r\nof India, the inhabitants of which are known as the Dardæ. It has the\r\ncolour of a cat, and is in size as large as an Egyptian wolf.[142] This\r\ngold, which it extracts in the winter, is taken by the Indians during\r\nthe heats of summer, while the ants are compelled, by the excessive\r\nwarmth, to hide themselves in their holes. Still, however, on being\r\naroused by catching the scent of the Indians, they sally forth, and\r\nfrequently tear them to pieces, though provided with the swiftest\r\ncamels for the purpose of flight; so great is their fleetness, combined\r\nwith their ferocity and their passion for gold!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37. (32.)—THE CHRYSALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany insects, however, are engendered in a different manner; and some\r\nmore especially from dew. This dew settles upon the radish[143] leaf in\r\nthe early days of spring; but when it has been thickened by the action\r\nof the sun, it becomes reduced to the size of a grain of millet. From\r\nthis a small grub afterwards arises, which, at the end of three days,\r\nbecomes transformed into a caterpillar. For several successive days it\r\nstill increases in size, but remains motionless, and covered with a\r\nhard husk. It moves only when touched, and is covered with a web like\r\nthat of the spider. In this state it is called a chrysalis, but after\r\nthe husk is broken, it flies forth in the shape of a butterfly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38. (33.)—ANIMALS WHICH BREED IN WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, also, some animals are generated in the earth\r\nfrom rain, and some, again, in wood. And not only wood-worms[144]\r\nare produced in wood, but gad-flies also and other insects issue\r\nfrom it, whenever there is an excess of moisture; just as in man,\r\ntape-worms[145] are sometimes found, as much as three hundred feet or\r\nmore in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—INSECTS THAT ARE PARASITES OF MAN. WHICH IS THE SMALLEST OF\r\nANIMALS? ANIMALS FOUND IN WAX EVEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, too, in dead carrion there are certain animals produced, and in\r\nthe hair, too, of living men. It was through such vermin as this that\r\nthe Dictator Sylla,[146] and Alcman, one of the most famous of the\r\nGrecian poets, met their deaths. These insects infest birds too, and\r\nare apt to kill the pheasant, unless it takes care to bathe itself in\r\nthe dust. Of the animals that are covered with hair, it is supposed\r\nthat the ass and the sheep are the only ones that are exempt from\r\nthese vermin. They are produced, also, in certain kinds of cloth, and\r\nmore particularly those made of the wool of sheep which have been\r\nkilled by the wolf. I find it stated, also, by authors, that some\r\nkinds of water[147] which we use for bathing are more productive of\r\nthese parasites than others. Even wax is found to produce mites, which\r\nare supposed to be the very smallest of all living creatures. Other\r\ninsects, again, are engendered from filth, acted upon by the rays of\r\nthe sun—these fleas are called “petauristæ,”[148] from the activity\r\nwhich they display in their hind legs. Others, again, are produced with\r\nwings, from the moist dust that is found lying in holes and corners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40. (34.)—AN ANIMAL WHICH HAS NO PASSAGE FOR THE EVACUATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an animal,[149] also, that is generated in the summer, which\r\nhas its head always buried deep in the skin [of a beast], and so,\r\nliving on its blood, swells to a large size. This is the only living\r\ncreature that has no outlet[150] for its food; hence, when it has\r\novergorged itself, it bursts asunder, and thus its very aliment is\r\nmade the cause of its death. This insect never breeds on beasts of\r\nburden, but is very commonly seen on oxen, and sometimes on dogs,\r\nwhich, indeed, are subject to every species of vermin. With sheep and\r\ngoats, it is the only parasite. The thirst, too, for blood displayed by\r\nleeches, which we find in marshy waters, is no less singular; for these\r\nwill thrust the entire head into the flesh in quest of it. There is a\r\nwinged insect[151] which peculiarly infests dogs, and more especially\r\nattacks them with its sting about the ears, where they are unable to\r\ndefend themselves with their teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41. (35.)—MOTHS, CANTHARIDES, GNATS—AN INSECT THAT BREEDS IN THE\r\nSNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nDust, too, is productive of worms[152] in wools and cloths, and this\r\nmore especially if a spider should happen to be enclosed in them: for,\r\nbeing sensible of thirst, it sucks up all the moisture, and thereby\r\nincreases the dryness of the material. These will breed in paper also.\r\nThere is one kind which carries with it its husk, in the same manner\r\nas the snail, only that the feet are to be seen. If deprived of it, it\r\ndoes not survive; and when it is fully developed, the insect becomes a\r\nchrysalis. The wild fig-tree produces gnats,[153] known as “ficarii;”\r\nand the little grubs of the fig-tree, the pear-tree, the pine, the\r\nwild rose, and the common rose produce cantharides,[154] when fully\r\ndeveloped. These insects, which are venomous, carry with them their\r\nantidote; for their wings are useful in medicine,[155] while the rest\r\nof the body is deadly. Again, liquids turned sour will produce other\r\nkinds of gnats, and white grubs are to be found in snow that has lain\r\nlong on the ground, while those that lie above are of a reddish[156]\r\ncolour—indeed, the snow itself becomes red after it has lain some time\r\non the ground. These grubs are covered with a sort of hair, are of a\r\nrather large size, and in a state of torpor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42. (36.)—AN ANIMAL FOUND IN FIRE—THE PYRALLIS OR PYRAUSTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat element, also, which is so destructive to matter, produces certain\r\nanimals; for in the copper-smelting furnaces of Cyprus, in the very\r\nmidst of the fire, there is to be seen flying about a four-footed\r\nanimal with wings, the size of a large fly: this creature is called the\r\n“pyrallis,” and by some the “pyrausta.” So long as it remains in the\r\nfire it will live, but if it comes out and flies a little distance from\r\nit, it will instantly die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—THE ANIMAL CALLED HEMEROBION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hypanis, a river of Pontus, brings down in its waters, about\r\nthe time of the summer solstice, small membranous particles, like a\r\ngrape-stone in appearance; from which there issues an animal[157] with\r\nfour legs and with wings, similar to the one just mentioned. It does\r\nnot, however, live more than a single day, from which circumstance it\r\nhas obtained the name of “hemerobion.”[158] The life of other insects\r\nof a similar nature is regulated from its beginning to its end by\r\nmultiples of seven. Thrice seven days is the duration of the life of\r\nthe gnat and of the maggot, while those that are viviparous live four\r\ntimes seven days, and their various changes and transformations take\r\nplace in periods of three or four days. The other insects of this kind\r\nthat are winged, generally die in the autumn, the gad-fly becoming\r\nquite blind[159] even before it dies. Flies which have been drowned in\r\nwater, if they are covered with ashes,[160] will return to life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44. (37.)—THE NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL ANIMALS\r\nCONSIDERED LIMB BY LIMB. THOSE WHICH HAVE TUFTS AND CRESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to what is already stated, we will add an account of every\r\npart of the body of an animal, taken limb by limb.\r\n\r\nAll those which have blood, have a head as well. A small number of\r\nanimals, and those only among the birds, have tufts of various kinds\r\nupon the head. The phœnix[161] has a long row of feathers on it, from\r\nthe middle of which arises another row; peacocks have a hairy tuft,\r\nresembling a bushy shrub; the stymphalis[162] has a sort of pointed\r\ncrest, and the pheasant, again, small horns. Added to these, there\r\nis the lark, a little bird, which, from the appearance of its tuft,\r\nwas formerly called “galerita,” but has since received the Gallic\r\nname of “alauda,”[163] a name which it has transferred to one of our\r\nlegions.[164] We have already made mention, also, of one bird[165]\r\nto which Nature has given a crest, which it can fold or unfold at\r\npleasure: the birds of the coot kind[166] have also received from\r\nher a crest, which takes its rise at the beak, and runs along the\r\nmiddle of the head; while the pie of Mars, and the Balearic crane, are\r\nfurnished with pointed tufts. But the most remarkable feature of all,\r\nis the crest which we see attached to the heads of our domestic fowls,\r\nsubstantial and indented like a saw; we cannot, in fact, strictly call\r\nit flesh, nor can we pronounce it to be cartilage or a callosity, but\r\nmust admit that it is something of a nature peculiar to itself. As to\r\nthe crests of dragons, there is no one to be found who ever saw one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF HORNS. ANIMALS IN WHICH THEY ARE\r\nMOVEABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorns, too, of various forms have been granted to many animals of the\r\naquatic, marine, and reptile kind, but those which are more properly\r\nunderstood under that name belong to the quadrupeds only; for I look\r\nupon the tales of Actæon and of Cippus even, in Latin story, as nothing\r\nmore nor less than fables.[167] And, indeed, in no department of her\r\nworks has Nature displayed a greater capriciousness. In providing\r\nanimals with these weapons, she has made merry at their expense; for\r\nsome she has spread them out in branches, the stag, for instance; to\r\nothers she has given them in a more simple form, as in the “subulo,”\r\nso called from the resemblance of its horns to a “subula,”[168] or\r\nshoemaker’s awl. In others, again, she has flattened them in the shape\r\nof a man’s hand, with the fingers extended, from which circumstance\r\nthe animal has received the name of “platyceros.”[169] To the roe-buck\r\nshe has given branching horns, but small, and has made them so as not\r\nto fall off and be cast each year; while to the ram she has given\r\nthem of a contorted and spiral form, as though she were providing it\r\nwith a cæstus for offence. The horns of the bull, again, are upright\r\nand threatening. In this last kind, the females, too, are provided\r\nwith them, while in most it is only the males. The chamois has them,\r\ncurving backwards; while in the fallow deer[170] they bend forward. The\r\nstrepsiceros,[171] which in Africa bears the name of addax, has horns\r\nerect and spiral, grooved and tapering to a sharp point, so much so,\r\nthat you would almost take them to be the sides of a lyre.[172] In the\r\noxen of Phrygia, the horns are moveable,[173] like the ears; and among\r\nthe cattle of the Troglodytæ, they are pointed downwards to the ground,\r\nfor which reason it is that they are obliged to feed with the head on\r\none side. Other animals, again, have a single horn, and that situate in\r\nthe middle of the head, or else on the nose, as already stated.[174]\r\n\r\nThen, again, in some animals the horns are adapted for butting, and\r\nin others for goring; with some they are curved inwards, with others\r\noutwards, and with others, again, they are fitted for tossing: all\r\nwhich objects are effected in various ways, the horns either lying\r\nbackwards, turning from, or else towards each other, and in all cases\r\nrunning to a sharp point. In one kind, also, the horns are used for the\r\npurpose of scratching the body, instead of hands.\r\n\r\nIn snails the horns are fleshy, and are thus adapted for the purpose\r\nof feeling the way, which is also the case with the cerastes;[175]\r\nsome reptiles, again, have only one horn, though the snail has always\r\ntwo, suited for protruding and withdrawing. The barbarous nations of\r\nthe north drink from the horns of the urus,[176] a pair of which will\r\nhold a couple of urnæ:[177] other tribes, again, point their spears\r\nwith them. With us they are cut into laminæ, upon which they become\r\ntransparent; indeed, the rays of a light placed within them may be\r\nseen to a much greater distance than without. They are used also for\r\nvarious appliances of luxury, either coloured or varnished, or else\r\nfor those kinds of paintings which are known as “cestrota,”[178] or\r\nhorn-pictures. The horns of all animals are hollow within, it being\r\nonly at the tip that they are solid: the only exception is the stag,\r\nthe horn of which is solid throughout, and is cast every year. When\r\nthe hoofs of oxen are worn to the quick, the husbandmen have a method\r\nof curing them, by anointing the horns of the animal with grease. The\r\nsubstance of the horns is so ductile, that even while upon the body of\r\nthe living animal, they can be bent by being steeped in boiling wax,\r\nand if they are split down when they are first shooting, they may be\r\ntwisted different ways, and so appear to be four in number upon one\r\nhead. In females the horns are generally thinner than in the males, as\r\nis the case, also, with most kinds of wool-bearing animals.\r\n\r\nNo individuals, however, among sheep, or hinds, nor yet any that have\r\nthe feet divided into toes, or that have solid hoofs, are furnished\r\nwith horns; with the sole exception of the Indian ass,[179] which is\r\narmed with a single horn. To the beasts that are cloven-footed Nature\r\nhas granted two horns, but to those that have fore-teeth in the upper\r\njaw, she has given none. Those persons who entertain the notion that\r\nthe substance of these teeth is expended in the formation of the\r\nhorns, are easily to be refuted, if we only consider the case of the\r\nhind, which has no more teeth than the male, and yet is without horns\r\naltogether. In the stag the horn is only imbedded in the skin, but in\r\nthe other[180] animals it adheres to the bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—THE HEADS OF ANIMALS. THOSE WHICH HAVE NONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe head of the fish is very large in proportion to the rest of the\r\nbody, probably, to facilitate its diving under water. Animals of the\r\noyster and the sponge kind have no head, which is the case, also, with\r\nmost of the other kinds, whose only sense is that of touch. Some,\r\nagain, have the head blended with the body, the crab, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—THE HAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all animals man has the longest hair upon the head; which is the\r\ncase more especially with those nations where the men and women in\r\ncommon leave the hair to grow, and do not cut it. Indeed, it is from\r\nthis fact, that the inhabitants of the Alps have obtained from us the\r\nname of “Capillati,”[181] as also those of Gallia, “Comata.”[182]\r\nThere is, however, a great difference in this respect according to\r\nthe various countries. In the island of Myconus,[183] the people are\r\nborn without hair, just as at Caunus the inhabitants are afflicted\r\nwith the spleen from their birth.[184] There are some animals, also,\r\nthat are naturally bald, such as the ostrich, for instance, and the\r\naquatic raven, which last has thence derived its Greek[185] name. It\r\nis but rarely that the hair falls off in women, and in eunuchs such\r\nis never known to be the case; nor yet does any person lose it before\r\nhaving known sexual intercourse.[186] The hair does not fall off below\r\nthe brain, nor yet beneath the crown of the head, or around the ears\r\nand the temples. Man is the only animal that becomes bald, with the\r\nexception, of course, of such animals as are naturally so. Man and the\r\nhorse are the only creatures whose hair turns grey; but with man this\r\nis always the case, first in the fore-part of the head, and then in the\r\nhinder part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48.—THE BONES OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome few persons only are double-crowned. The bones of the head are\r\nflat, thin, devoid of marrow, and united with sutures indented like a\r\ncomb. When broken asunder they cannot be united, but the extraction\r\nof a small portion is not necessarily fatal, as a fleshy cicatrix\r\nforms, and so makes good the loss. We have already mentioned, in their\r\nrespective[187] places, that the skull of the bear is the weakest of\r\nall, and that of the parrot the hardest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brain exists in all animals which have blood, and in those sea\r\nanimals as well, which we have already mentioned as mollusks, although\r\nthey are destitute of blood, the polypus, for instance. Man, however,\r\nhas, in proportion to his body, the most voluminous brain of all.\r\nThis, too, is the most humid, and the coldest of all the viscera, and\r\nis enveloped above and below with two membranous integuments, for\r\neither of which to be broken is fatal. In addition to these facts, we\r\nmay remark that the brain is larger in men than in women. In man the\r\nbrain is destitute of blood and veins, and in other animals it has\r\nno fat. Those who are well informed on the subject, tell us that the\r\nbrain is quite a different substance from the marrow, seeing that on\r\nbeing boiled it only becomes harder. In the very middle of the brain\r\nof every animal there are small bones found. Man is the only animal in\r\nwhich it is known to palpitate[188] during infancy; and it does not\r\ngain its proper consistency until after the child has made its first\r\nattempt to speak. The brain is the most elevated of all the viscera,\r\nand the nearest to the roof of the head; it is equally devoid of flesh,\r\nblood, and excretions. The senses hold this organ as their citadel; it\r\nis in this that are centred all the veins which spring from the heart;\r\nit is here that they terminate; this is the very culminating point\r\nof all, the regulator of the understanding. With all animals it is\r\nadvanced to the fore-part of the head, from the fact that the senses\r\nhave a tendency to the direction in which we look. From the brain\r\nproceeds sleep, and its return it is that causes the head to nod. Those\r\ncreatures, in fact, which have no brain, never sleep. It is said that\r\nstags[189] have in the head certain small maggots, twenty in number:\r\nthey are situate in the empty space that lies beneath the tongue, and\r\naround the joints by which the head is united to the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—THE EARS. ANIMALS WHICH HEAR WITHOUT EARS OR APERTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan is the only animal the ears of which are immoveable. It is from\r\nthe natural flaccidity of the ear, that the surname of _Flaccus_ is\r\nderived. There is no part of the body that creates a more enormous\r\nexpense for our women, in the pearls which are suspended from them.\r\nIn the East, too, it is thought highly becoming for the men, even, to\r\nwear gold rings in their ears. Some animals have large, and others\r\nsmall ears. The stag alone has them cut and divided, as it were; in\r\nthe field-mouse they have a velvet surface. All the animals that are\r\nviviparous have ears of some kind or other, with the sole exception of\r\nthe sea-calf, the dolphin, the fishes which we have mentioned[190]\r\nas cartilaginous, and the viper. These animals have only cavities\r\ninstead of ears, with the exception of the cartilaginous fishes and\r\nthe dolphin, which last, however, it is quite clear possesses the\r\nsense of hearing, for it is charmed by singing, and is often taken\r\nwhile enraptured with the melody: how it is that it does hear, is\r\nquite marvellous. These animals, too, have not the slightest trace of\r\nolfactory organs, and yet they have a most acute sense of smell.\r\n\r\nAmong the winged animals, only the horned owl and the long-eared owl\r\nhave feathers which project like ears, the rest having only cavities\r\nfor the purpose of hearing; the same is the case, also, with the scaly\r\nanimals and the serpents. Among horses and beasts of burden of all\r\nkinds, it is the ears which indicate the natural feelings; when the\r\nanimal is weary, they are drooping and flaccid; when it is startled,\r\nthey quiver to and fro; when it is enraged, they are pricked up; and\r\nwhen it is ailing, they are pendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—THE FACE, THE FOREHEAD, AND THE EYE-BROWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan is the only creature that has a face, the other animals having\r\nonly a muzzle or a beak. Other animals have a forehead as well, but\r\nit is only on the forehead of man that is depicted sorrow, gladness,\r\ncompassion, or severity. It is the forehead that is the index of the\r\nmind. Man has eyebrows, also, which move together or alternately;\r\nthese, too, serve in some measure as indications of the feelings. Do\r\nwe deny or do we assent, it is the eyebrows, mostly, that indicate\r\nour intentions. Feelings of pride may be generated elsewhere, but it\r\nis here that they have their principal abode; it is in the heart that\r\nthey take their rise, but it is to the eyebrows that they mount, and\r\nhere they take up their position. In no part of the body could they\r\nmeet with a spot more lofty and more precipitous, in which to establish\r\nthemselves free from all control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—THE EYES—ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO EYES, OR HAVE ONLY ONE EYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow the forehead are the eyes, which form the most precious portion\r\nof the human body, and which, by the enjoyment of the blessings of\r\nsight, distinguish life from death. Eyes, however, have not been\r\ngranted to all animals; oysters have none, but, with reference to some\r\nof the shell-fish, the question is still doubtful; for if we move the\r\nfingers before a scallop half open, it will immediately close its\r\nshell, apparently from seeing them, while the solen[191] will start\r\naway from an iron instrument when placed near it. Among quadrupeds\r\nthe mole[192] has no sight, though it has something that bears a\r\nresemblance to eyes, if we remove the membrane that is extended in\r\nfront of them. Among birds also, it is said that a species of heron,\r\nwhich is known as the “leucus,”[193] is wanting of one eye: a bird\r\nof most excellent augury, when it flies towards the south or north,\r\nfor it is said that it portends thereby that there is about to be an\r\nend of perils and alarms. Nigidius says also, that neither locusts\r\nnor grasshoppers have eyes. In snails,[194] the two small horns with\r\nwhich they feel their way, perform the duties of eyes. Neither the\r\nmawworm[195] nor any other kind of worm has eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53.—THE DIVERSITY OF THE COLOUR OF THE EYES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eyes vary in colour in the human race only; in all other animals\r\nthey are of one uniform colour peculiar to the kind, though there\r\nare some horses that have eyes of an azure colour. But in man the\r\nvarieties and diversities are most numerous; the eyes being either\r\nlarge, of middling size, remarkably small, or remarkably prominent.\r\nThese last are generally supposed to be very weak, while those which\r\nare deep-seated are considered the best, as is the case also with those\r\nwhich in colour resemble the eyes of the goat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54.—THE THEORY OF SIGHT—PERSONS WHO CAN SEE BY NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, there are some persons who can see to a very\r\ngreat distance, while there are others, again, who can only distinguish\r\nobjects when brought quite close to them. The vision of many stands in\r\nneed of the rays of the sun; such persons cannot see on a cloudy day,\r\nnor yet after the sun has set. Others, again, have bad sight in the\r\nday-time, but a sight superior to that of others by night. Of persons\r\nhaving double pupils, or the evil eye, we have already spoken[196] at\r\nsufficient length. Blue[197] eyes are the best for seeing in the dark.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Tiberius Cæsar, like no other human being, was so\r\nendowed by Nature, that on awaking in the night[198] he could for\r\na few moments distinguish objects just as well as in the clearest\r\ndaylight, but that by degrees he would find his sight again enveloped\r\nin darkness. The late Emperor Augustus had azure eyes like those of\r\nsome horses, the white being larger than with other men; he used to be\r\nvery angry if a person stared intently at them for this peculiarity.\r\nClaudius Cæsar had at the corners of the eyes a white fleshy substance,\r\ncovered with veins, which would occasionally become suffused with\r\nblood; with the Emperor Caius[199] they had a fixed, steady gaze,\r\nwhile Nero could see nothing distinctly without winking, and having\r\nit brought close to his eyes. The Emperor Caius had twenty pairs of\r\ngladiators in his training-school, and of all these there were only\r\ntwo who did not wink the eyes when a menacing gesture was made close\r\nto them: hence it was that these men were invincible. So difficult a\r\nmatter is it for a man to keep his eyes from winking: indeed, to wink\r\nis so natural to many, that they cannot desist from it; such persons we\r\ngenerally look upon as the most timid.\r\n\r\nNo persons have the eye all of one colour; that of the middle of\r\nthe eye is always different from the white which surrounds it. In\r\nall animals there is no part in the whole body that is a stronger\r\nexponent of the feelings, and in man more especially, for it is\r\nfrom the expression of the eye that we detect clemency, moderation,\r\ncompassion, hatred, love, sadness, and joy. From the eyes, too, the\r\nvarious characters of persons are judged of, according as they are\r\nferocious, menacing, sparkling, sedate, leering, askance, downcast,\r\nor languishing. Beyond a doubt it is in the eyes that the mind has its\r\nabode: sometimes the look is ardent, sometimes fixed and steady, at\r\nother times the eyes are humid, and at others, again, half closed. From\r\nthese it is that the tears of pity flow, and when we kiss them we seem\r\nto be touching the very soul. It is the eyes that weep, and from them\r\nproceed those streams that moisten our cheeks as they trickle down.\r\nAnd what is this liquid that is always so ready and in such abundance\r\nin our moments of grief, and where is it kept in reserve at other\r\ntimes? It is by the aid of the mind that we see, by the aid of the\r\nmind that we enjoy perception; while the eyes, like so many vessels,\r\nas it were, receive its visual faculties and transmit them. Hence it\r\nis that profound thought renders a man blind for the time, the powers\r\nof sight being withdrawn from external objects and thrown inward: so,\r\ntoo, in epilepsy, the mind is covered with darkness, while the eyes,\r\nthough open, are able to see nothing. In addition to this, it is the\r\nfact that hares, as well as many human beings, can sleep with the eyes\r\nopen, a thing which the Greeks express by the term κορυβαντιᾷν. Nature\r\nhas composed the eye of numerous membranes of remarkable thinness,\r\ncovering them with a thick coat to ensure their protection against heat\r\nand cold. This coat she purifies from time to time by the lachrymal\r\nhumours, and she has made the surface lubricous and slippery, to\r\nprotect the eye against the effects of a sudden shock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55.—THE NATURE OF THE PUPIL—EYES WHICH DO NOT SHUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the cornea of the eye Nature has formed a window in the\r\npupil, the small dimensions of which do not permit the sight to wander\r\nat hazard and with uncertainty, but direct it as straight as though it\r\nwere through a tube, and at the same time ensure its avoidance of all\r\nshocks communicated by foreign bodies. The pupils are surrounded by\r\na black circle in some persons, while it is of a yellowish cast with\r\nothers, and azure again with others. By this happy combination the\r\nlight is received by the eye upon the white that lies around the pupil,\r\nand its reflection being thus tempered, it fails to impede or confuse\r\nthe sight by its harshness. So complete a mirror, too, does the eye\r\nform, that the pupil, small as it is, is able to reflect the entire\r\nimage of a man. This[200] is the reason why most birds, when held in\r\nthe hand of a person, will more particularly peck at his eyes; for\r\nseeing their own likeness reflected in the pupils, they are attracted\r\nto it by what seem to be the objects of their natural affection.\r\n\r\nIt is only some few beasts of burden that are subject to maladies of\r\nthe eyes towards the increase of the moon: but it is man alone that is\r\nrescued from blindness by the discharge of the humours[201] that have\r\ncaused it. Many persons have had their sight restored after being blind\r\nfor twenty years; while others, again, have been denied this blessing\r\nfrom their very birth, without there being any blemish in the eyes.\r\nMany persons, again, have suddenly lost their sight from no apparent\r\ncause, and without any preceding injury. The most learned authors say\r\nthat there are veins which communicate from the eye to the brain, but\r\nI am inclined to think that the communication is with the stomach; for\r\nit is quite certain that a person never loses the eye without feeling\r\nsickness at the stomach. It is an important and sacred duty, of high\r\nsanction among the Romans, to close[202] the eyes of the dead, and then\r\nagain to open them when the body is laid on the funeral pile, the usage\r\nhaving taken its rise in the notion of its being improper that the\r\neyes of the dead should be beheld by man, while it is an equally great\r\noffence to hide them from the view of heaven. Man is the only living\r\ncreature the eyes of which are subject to deformities, from which, in\r\nfact, arose the family names of “Strabo”[203] and “Pætus.”[204] The\r\nancients used to call a man who was born with only one eye, “cocles,”\r\nand “ocella,” a person whose eyes were remarkably small. “Luscinus”\r\nwas the surname given to one who happened to have lost one eye by an\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of animals that see at night in the dark, cats, for instance,\r\nare shining and radiant, so much so, that it is impossible to look upon\r\nthem; those of the she-goat, too, and the wolf are resplendent, and\r\nemit a light like fire. The eyes of the sea-calf and the hyæna change\r\nsuccessively to a thousand colours; and the eyes, when dried, of most\r\nof the fishes will give out light in the dark, just in the same way as\r\nthe trunk of the oak when it has become rotten with extreme old age.\r\nWe have already mentioned[205] the fact, that animals which turn, not\r\nthe eyes but the head, for the purpose of looking round, are never\r\nknown to wink. It is said,[206] too, that the chameleon is able to\r\nroll the eye-balls completely round. Crabs look sideways, and have the\r\neyes enclosed beneath a thin crust. Those of craw-fish and shrimps are\r\nvery hard and prominent, and lie in a great measure beneath a defence\r\nof a similar nature. Those animals, however, the eyes of which are\r\nhard, have worse sight than those of which the eyes are formed of a\r\nhumid substance. It is said that if the eyes are taken away from the\r\nyoung of serpents and of the swallow,[207] they will grow again. In\r\nall insects and in animals covered with a shell, the eyes move just\r\nin the same way as the ears of quadrupeds do; those among them which\r\nhave a brittle[208] covering have the eyes hard. All animals of this\r\nnature, as well as fishes and insects, are destitute of eye-lids, and\r\ntheir eyes have no covering; but in all there is a membrane that is\r\ntransparent like glass, spread over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—THE HAIR OF THE EYE-LIDS; WHAT ANIMALS ARE WITHOUT THEM.\r\nANIMALS WHICH CAN SEE ON ONE SIDE ONLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan has lashes on the eye-lids on either side; and women even make\r\nit their daily care to stain them;[209] so ardent are they in the\r\npursuit of beauty, that they must even colour their very eyes. It was\r\nwith another view, however, that Nature had provided the hair of the\r\neyelids—they were to have acted, so to say, as a kind of rampart for\r\nthe protection of the sight, and as an advanced bulwark against the\r\napproach of insects or other objects which might accidentally come\r\nin their way. It is not without some reason that it is said that the\r\neyelashes[210] fall off with those persons who are too much given to\r\nvenereal pleasures. Of the other animals, the only ones that have\r\neyelashes are those that have hair on the rest of the body as well;\r\nbut the quadrupeds have them on the upper eyelid only, and the birds\r\non the lower one: the same is the case also with those which have a\r\nsoft skin, such as the serpent, and those among the quadrupeds that are\r\noviparous, the lizard, for instance. The ostrich is the only one among\r\nthe birds that, like man, has eyelashes on either side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57.—ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO EYELIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll birds, however, have not eyelids: hence it is, that those which are\r\nviviparous have no nictation of the eye. The heavier kinds of birds\r\nshut the eye by means of the lower eyelid, and they wink by drawing\r\nforward a membrane which lies in the corner of the eye. Pigeons,\r\nand other birds of a similar nature, shut the two eyelids; but the\r\nquadrupeds which are oviparous, such, for instance, as the tortoise\r\nand the crocodile, have only the lower eyelid moveable, and never\r\nwink, in consequence of the hardness of the eye. The edge of the upper\r\neyelid was by the ancients called “cilium,” from which comes our word\r\n“supercilia.[211]” If the eyelid happens to be severed by a wound it\r\nwill not reunite,[212] which is the case also with some few other parts\r\nof the human body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—THE CHEEKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow the eyes are the cheeks, a feature which is found in man only.\r\nFrom the ancients they received the name of “genæ,” and by the laws of\r\nthe Twelve Tables, women were forbidden to tear them.[213] The cheeks\r\nare the seat of bashfulness; it is on them more particularly that\r\nblushes are to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59.—THE NOSTRILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the cheeks is the mouth, which gives such strong indications\r\nof the feelings of joyousness and laughter; and above it, but in man\r\nonly, is the nose, which modern notions have stamped as the exponent\r\nof sarcasm and ridicule.[214] In no other animal but man, is the nose\r\nthus prominent; birds, serpents, and fishes, have no nostrils, but\r\napertures only for the purpose of smell. It is from the peculiarity of\r\nthe nose that are derived the surnames of “Simus”[215] and “Silo.”\r\nChildren born in the seventh month often have the ears and the nostrils\r\nimperforate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60.—THE MOUTH; THE LIPS; THE CHIN; AND THE JAW-BONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is from the “labia,” or lips, that the Brocchi[216] have received\r\nthe surname of Labeo. All animals that are viviparous have a mouth that\r\nis either well-formed, or harshly defined, as the case may be. Instead\r\nof lips and mouth, the birds have a beak that is horny and sharp at the\r\nend. With birds that live by rapine, the beak is hooked inwards, but\r\nwith those which gather and peck only, it is straight: those animals,\r\nagain, which root up grass or puddle in the mud, have the muzzle broad,\r\nlike swine. The beasts of burden employ the mouth in place of hands in\r\ngathering their food, while those which live by rapine and slaughter\r\nhave it wider than the rest. No animal, with the exception of man, has\r\neither chin or cheek-bones. The crocodile is the only animal that has\r\nthe upper jaw-bone[217] moveable; among the land quadrupeds it is the\r\nsame as with other animals, except that they can move it obliquely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 61.—THE TEETH; THE VARIOUS KINDS OF TEETH; IN WHAT ANIMALS THEY\r\nARE NOT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MOUTH: ANIMALS WHICH HAVE HOLLOW TEETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeeth are arranged in three different ways, serrated, in one continuous\r\nrow, or else protruding from the mouth. When serrated they unite\r\ntogether, just like those of a comb, in order that they may not be worn\r\nby rubbing against one another, as in serpents, fishes, and dogs,[218]\r\nfor instance. In some creatures they are set in one continuous row,\r\nman and the horse, for instance; while in the wild boar, the elephant,\r\nand the hippopotamus, they protrude from the mouth.[219] Among those\r\nset in one continuous row, the teeth which divide the food are broad\r\nand sharp, while those which grind it are double; the teeth which lie\r\nbetween the incisive and the molar teeth, are those known as the canine\r\nor dog-teeth; these are by far the largest in those animals which have\r\nserrated teeth. Those animals which have continuous rows of teeth,\r\nhave them either situate on both sides of the mouth, as in the horse,\r\nor else have no fore-teeth in the upper part of the mouth, as is the\r\ncase with oxen, sheep, and all the animals that ruminate. The she-goat\r\nhas no upper teeth, except the two front ones. No animals which have\r\nserrated teeth, have them protruding[220] from the mouth; among these,\r\ntoo, the females rarely have them; and to those that do have them, they\r\nare of no[221] use: hence it is, that while the boar strikes, the sow\r\nbites. No animal with horns has projecting teeth; and all such teeth\r\nare hollow, while in other animals the teeth are solid. All[222] fish\r\nhave the teeth serrated, with the exception of the scarus,[223] this\r\nbeing the only one among the aquatic animals that has them level[224]\r\nat the edges. In addition to this, there are many fishes that have\r\nteeth upon the tongue and over the whole of the mouth, in order that,\r\nby the multitude of the bites which they inflict, they may soften those\r\narticles of food which they could not possibly manage by tearing. Many\r\nanimals, also, have teeth in the palate, and even in the tail;[225]\r\nin addition to which, some have them inclining to the interior of the\r\nmouth, that the food may not fall out, the animal itself having no\r\nother means of retaining it there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 62.—THE TEETH OF SERPENTS; THEIR POISON. A BIRD WHICH HAS TEETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe asp also, and other serpents, have similar teeth; but in the\r\nupper jaw, on the right and left, they have two of extreme length,\r\nwhich are perforated with a small tube in the interior, just like\r\nthe sting of the scorpion, and it is through these that they eject\r\ntheir venom. The writers who have made the most diligent enquiries\r\non the subject, inform us that this venom is nothing but the gall of\r\nthe serpent, and that it is conveyed to the mouth by certain veins\r\nwhich run beneath the spine; indeed, there are some who state that\r\nthere is only one poison-fang, and that being barbed at the end, it is\r\nbent backwards when the animal has inflicted a bite. Other writers,\r\nhowever, affirm that on such an occasion the fang falls out, as it is\r\nvery easily displaced, but that it soon grows[226] again; this tooth,\r\nthey say, is thus wanting in the serpents which we see handled about by\r\npersons.[227] It is also stated that this fang exists in the tail of\r\nthe scorpion, and that most of these animals have no less than three.\r\nThe teeth of the viper are concealed in the gums: the animal, being\r\nprovided with a similar venom, exercises the pressure of its fangs for\r\nthe purpose of instilling the poison in its bite.\r\n\r\nNo winged creatures have teeth, with the sole exception of the bat.\r\nThe camel is the only one among the animals without horns, that has\r\nno fore-teeth[228] in the upper jaw. None of the horned animals have\r\nserrated[229] teeth. Snails, too, have teeth; a proof of which are\r\nthe vetches which we find gnawed away by snails of the very smallest\r\nsize. To assert that among marine animals, those that have shells, and\r\nthose that are cartilaginous have fore-teeth, and that the sea-urchin\r\nhas five teeth, I am very much surprised how such a notion could have\r\npossibly[230] arisen. With insects the sting supplies the place of\r\nteeth; the ape has teeth just like those in man.[231] The elephant\r\nhas in the interior of the mouth fourteen teeth, adapted for chewing,\r\nin addition to those which protrude; in the male these are curved\r\ninwards, but in the female they are straight, and project outwards.\r\nThe sea-mouse,[232] a fish which goes before the balæna, has no teeth\r\nat all, but in place of them, the interior of the mouth is lined with\r\nbristles, as well as the tongue and palate. Among the smaller land\r\nquadrupeds, the two fore-teeth in each jaw are the longest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 63.—WONDERFUL CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE TEETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other animals are born with[233] teeth, whereas man has them only\r\nat the seventh[234] month after his birth. While other[235] animals\r\nkeep their teeth to the time of their death, man, the lion, the beasts\r\nof burden, the dog, and the ruminating animals, all change them; the\r\nlion and the dog, however, change none[236] but the canine teeth. The\r\ncanine tooth of the wolf, on the right side, is held in high esteem\r\nas an amulet.[237] There is no animal that changes the maxillary\r\nteeth, which stand beyond the canine teeth. With man, the last teeth,\r\nwhich are known as the “genuini,” or cheek teeth,[238] come about the\r\ntwentieth year, and with many men, and females as well, so late even as\r\nthe eightieth; but this only in the case of those who have not had them\r\nin their youth. It is a well-known fact, that the teeth are sometimes\r\nshed in old age, and replaced by others. Mucianus has stated that he,\r\nhimself, saw one Zocles, a native of Samothrace, who had a new set of\r\nteeth when he was past his one hundred and fourth year. In addition\r\nto these facts, in man males have more teeth than females,[239] which\r\nis the case also in sheep, goats, and swine. Timarchus, the son of\r\nNicocles the Paphian, had a double[240] row of teeth in his jaws: the\r\nsame person had a brother also who never changed his front teeth, and,\r\nconsequently, wore them to the very stumps. There is an instance,\r\nalso, of a man having a tooth growing in the palate.[241] The canine\r\nteeth,[242] when lost by any accident, are never known to come again.\r\nWhile in all other animals the teeth grow of a tawny colour with old\r\nage, with the horse, and him only, they become whiter the older he\r\ngrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 64.—HOW AN ESTIMATE IS FORMED OF THE AGE OF ANIMALS FROM THEIR\r\nTEETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe age, in beasts of burden,[243] is indicated by the teeth. In\r\nthe horse they are forty in number. At thirty months it loses the\r\ntwo fore-teeth in either jaw, and in the following year the same\r\nnumber next to them, at the time that the eye-teeth[244] come. At\r\nthe beginning of the fifth year the animal loses two teeth, which\r\ngrow again in the sixth, and in the seventh it has all its teeth,\r\nthose which have replaced the others, and those which have never been\r\nchanged. If a horse is gelded[245] before it changes its teeth, it\r\nnever sheds them. In a similar manner, also, the ass loses four of\r\nits teeth in the thirtieth month, and the others from six months to\r\nsix months. If a she-ass happens not to have foaled before the last\r\nof these teeth are shed, it is sure to be barren.[246] Oxen change\r\ntheir teeth at two years old: with swine they are never changed.[247]\r\nWhen these several indications of age have been lost in horses and\r\nother beasts of burden, the age is ascertained by the projecting of\r\nthe teeth, the greyness of the hair in the eyebrows, and the hollow\r\npits that form around them; at this period the animal is supposed\r\nto be about sixteen[248] years old. In the human teeth there is a\r\ncertain venom; for if they are placed uncovered before a mirror, they\r\nwill tarnish its brightness, and they will kill young pigeons while\r\nyet unfledged. The other particulars relative to the teeth have been\r\nalready[249] mentioned under the head of the generation of man. When\r\nteething first commences, the bodies of infants are subject to certain\r\nmaladies. Those animals which have serrated teeth inflict the most\r\ndangerous bites.[250]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 65.—THE TONGUE; ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO TONGUE. THE NOISE MADE BY\r\nFROGS. THE PALATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tongue is not similarly formed in all animals. Serpents have a\r\nvery thin tongue, and three-forked,[251] which they vibrate to and\r\nfro: it is of a black colour, and when drawn from out of the mouth,\r\nof extraordinary length. The tongue of the lizard is two-forked, and\r\ncovered with hair.[252] That of the sea-calf also is twofold,[253] but\r\nwith the serpents it is of the thinness of a hair; the other animals\r\nemploy it to lick the parts around the mouth. Fishes have nearly the\r\nwhole of the tongue adhering to the palate, while in the crocodile\r\nthe whole of it does adhere thereto: but in the aquatic animals the\r\npalate, which is fleshy, performs the duty of the tongue as the organ\r\nof taste. In lions, pards, and all the animals of that class, and in\r\ncats as well, the tongue is covered with asperities,[254] which overlap\r\neach other, and bear a strong resemblance to a rasp. Such being its\r\nformation, if the animal licks a man’s skin, it will wear it away by\r\nmaking it thinner and thinner; for which reason it is that the saliva\r\nof even a perfectly tame animal, being thus introduced to the close\r\nvicinity of the blood, is apt to bring on madness. Of the tongue of the\r\npurple we have made mention[255] already. With the frog the end of the\r\ntongue adheres to the mouth, while the inner part is disjoined from\r\nthe sides of the gullet; and it is by this means that the males give\r\nutterance to their croaking, at the season at which they are known as\r\nololygones.[256] This happens at stated periods of the year, at which\r\nthe males invite the females for the purposes of propagation: letting\r\ndown the lower lip to the surface of the water, they receive a small\r\nportion of it in the mouth, and then, by quavering with the tongue,\r\nmake a gurgling noise, from which the croaking is produced which we\r\nhear. In making this noise, the folds of the mouth, becoming distended,\r\nare quite transparent, and the eyes start from the head and burn again\r\nwith the effort. Those insects which have a sting in the lower part\r\nof the body, have teeth, and a tongue as well; with bees it is of\r\nconsiderable length, and in the grasshopper it is very prominent. Those\r\ninsects which have a fistulous sting in the mouth, have neither tongue\r\nnor teeth; while others, again, have a tongue in the interior of the\r\nmouth, the ant, for instance. In the elephant the tongue is remarkably\r\nbroad; and while with all other animals, each according to its kind, it\r\nis always perfectly at liberty, with man, and him alone, it is often\r\nfound so strongly tied down by certain veins, that it becomes necessary\r\nto cut them. We find it stated that the pontiff Metellus had a tongue\r\nso ill adapted for articulation, that he is generally supposed to have\r\nvoluntarily submitted to torture for many months, while preparing to\r\npronounce the speech which he was about to make on the dedication\r\nof the temple of Opifera.[257] In most persons the tongue is able\r\nto articulate with distinctness at about the seventh year; and many\r\nknow how to employ it with such remarkable skill, as to be able to\r\nimitate the voices of various birds and other animals with the greatest\r\nexactness. The other animals have the sense of taste centred in the\r\nfore-part of the tongue; but in man it is situate in the palate as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 66.—THE TONSILS; THE UVA; THE EPIGLOSSIS; THE ARTERY; THE GULLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn man there are tonsils at the root of the tongue; these in swine are\r\ncalled the glandules. The uvula,[258] which is suspended between them\r\nat the extremity of the palate, is found only in man. Beneath this\r\nlies a smaller tongue, known by the name of “epiglossis,”[259] but it\r\nis wanting in animals that are oviparous. Placed as it is between two\r\npassages, the functions of the epiglottis are of a twofold nature. The\r\none of these passages that lies more inward is called the [tracheal]\r\nartery, and leads to the lungs and the heart: the epiglottis covers\r\nit during the action of eating, that the drink or food may not go the\r\nwrong way, and so be productive of suffering, as it is by this passage\r\nthat the breath and the voice are conveyed. The other or exterior\r\npassage is called the “gula,”[260] and it is by this passage that the\r\nvictuals and drink pass: this leads to the belly, while the former one\r\ncommunicates with the chest.[261] The epiglottis covers the pharynx, in\r\nits turn, when only the breath or the voice is passing, in order that\r\nthe victuals may not inopportunely pass upwards, and so disturb the\r\nbreathing or articulation. The tracheal artery is composed of cartilage\r\nand flesh, while the gullet is formed of a sinewy substance united with\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 67.—THE NECK; THE THROAT; THE DORSAL SPINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe neck is found to exist in no animal but those which have both these\r\npassages. All the others which have the gullet only, have nothing but\r\na gorge or throat. In those which have a neck, it is formed of several\r\nrounded vertebræ, and is flexible, and joined together by distinct\r\narticulations, to allow of the animal turning round the head to look.\r\nThe lion, the wolf, and the hyæna are the only animals in which it\r\nis formed of a single[262] rigid bone. The neck is annexed to the\r\nspine, and the spine to the loins. The vertebral column is of a bony\r\nsubstance, but rounded, and pierced within, to afford a passage for\r\nthe marrow to descend from the brain. It is generally concluded that\r\nthe marrow is of the same nature as the brain, from the fact that if\r\nthe membrane of exceeding thinness which covers it is pierced, death\r\nimmediately ensues.[263] Those animals which have long legs have a long\r\nthroat as well, which is the case also with aquatic birds, although\r\nthey have short legs, as well as with those which have hooked talons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 68.—THE THROAT; THE GULLET; THE STOMACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan only, and the swine, are subject to swellings in the throat, which\r\nare mostly caused by the noxious quality of the water[264] which they\r\ndrink. The upper part of the gullet is called the fauces, the lower\r\nthe stomach.[265] By this name is understood a fleshy concavity,\r\nsituate behind the tracheal artery, and joining the vertebral column;\r\nit extends in length and breadth like a sort of chasm.[266] Those\r\nanimals which have no gullet have no stomach either, nor yet any neck\r\nor throat, fishes, for example; and in all these the mouth communicates\r\nimmediately with the belly. The sea-tortoise[267] has neither tongue\r\nnor teeth; it can break anything, however, with the sharp edge of\r\nits muzzle. After the tracheal artery there is the œsophagus, which\r\nis indented with hard asperities resembling bramble-thorns, for the\r\npurpose of levigating the food, the incisions[268] gradually becoming\r\nsmaller as they approach the belly. The roughness at the very extremity\r\nof this organ strongly resembles that of a blacksmith’s file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 69.—THE HEART; THE BLOOD; THE VITAL SPIRIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all other animals but man the heart is situate in the middle of the\r\nbreast; in man alone it is placed just below the pap on the left-hand\r\nside, the smaller end terminating in a point, and bearing outward. It\r\nis among the fish only that this point is turned towards the mouth.\r\nIt is asserted that the heart is the first among the viscera that is\r\nformed in the fœtus, then the brain, and last of all, the eyes: it is\r\nsaid, too, that the eyes are the first organs that die, and the heart\r\nthe very last of all. The heart also is the principal seat of the heat\r\nof the body; it is constantly palpitating, and moves as though it were\r\none animal enclosed within another. It is also enveloped in a membrane\r\nequally supple and strong, and is protected by the bulwarks formed by\r\nthe ribs and the bone of the breast, as being the primary source and\r\norigin of life. It contains within itself the primary receptacles for\r\nthe spirit and the blood, in its sinuous cavity, which in the larger\r\nanimals is threefold,[269] and in all twofold at least: here it is that\r\nthe mind[270] has its abode. From this source proceed two large veins,\r\nwhich branch into the fore-part and the back of the body, and which,\r\nspreading out in a series of branches, convey the vital blood by other\r\nsmaller veins over all parts of the body. This is the only one[271]\r\namong the viscera that is not affected by maladies, nor is it subject\r\nto the ordinary penalties of human life; but when injured, it produces\r\ninstant death. While all the other viscera are injured, vitality may\r\nstill remain in the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 70.—THOSE ANIMALS WHICH HAVE THE LARGEST HEART, AND THOSE WHICH\r\nHAVE THE SMALLEST. WHAT ANIMALS HAVE TWO HEARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose animals are looked upon as stupid and lumpish which have a hard,\r\nrigid heart, while those in which it is small are courageous, and\r\nthose are timid which have it very large. The heart is the largest, in\r\nproportion to the body, in the mouse, the hare, the ass, the stag, the\r\npanther, the weasel, the hyæna, and all the animals, in fact, which\r\nare timid, or dangerous only from the effects of fear. In Paphlagonia\r\nthe partridge has a double heart. In the heart of the horse and the ox\r\nthere are bones sometimes found. It is said that the heart increases\r\nevery year in man, and that two drachmæ in weight are added[272] yearly\r\nup to the fiftieth year, after which period it decreases yearly in a\r\nsimilar ratio; and that it is for this reason that men do not live\r\nbeyond their hundredth year, the heart then failing them: this is the\r\nnotion entertained by the Egyptians, whose custom it is to embalm the\r\nbodies of the dead, and so preserve them. It is said that men have\r\nbeen born with the heart covered with hair, and that such persons\r\nare excelled by none in valour and energy; such, for instance, as\r\nAristomenes,[273] the Messenian, who slew three hundred Lacedæmonians.\r\nBeing covered with wounds, and taken prisoner, he, on one occasion,\r\nmade his escape by a narrow hole which he discovered[274] in the stone\r\nquarry where he was imprisoned, while in pursuit of a fox which had\r\nfound that mode of exit. Being again taken prisoner, while his guards\r\nwere fast asleep he rolled himself towards a fire close by, and, at\r\nthe expense of his body, burnt off the cords by which he was bound. On\r\nbeing taken a third time, the Lacedæmonians opened his breast while he\r\nwas still alive, and his heart was found covered with hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 71.—WHEN THE CUSTOM WAS FIRST ADOPTED OF EXAMINING THE HEART IN\r\nTHE INSPECTION OF THE ENTRAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn an examination of the entrails, to find a certain fatty part on\r\nthe top of the heart, is looked upon as a fortunate presage. Still,\r\nhowever the heart has not always been considered as forming a part of\r\nthe entrails for this purpose. It was under Lucius Postumius Albinus,\r\nthe King of the Sacrifices,[275] and after the 126th Olympiad, when\r\nKing Pyrrhus had quitted Italy, that the aruspices began to examine\r\nthe heart, as part of the consecrated entrails. The first day that\r\nthe Dictator Cæsar appeared in public, clothed in purple, and sitting\r\non a seat of gold, the heart was twice found wanting[276] when he\r\nsacrificed. From this circumstance has risen a great question among\r\nthose who discuss matters connected with divination—whether it was\r\npossible for the victim to have lived without that organ, or whether\r\nit had lost it at the very moment[277] of its death. It is asserted\r\nthat the heart cannot be burnt of those persons who die of the\r\ncardiac disease; and the same is said of those who die by poison.\r\nAt all events, there is still in existence an oration pronounced by\r\nVitellius,[278] in which he accuses Piso of this crime, and employs\r\nthis alleged fact as one of his proofs, openly asserting that the\r\nheart of Germanicus Cæsar could not be burnt at the funeral pile,\r\nin consequence of his having been poisoned. On the other hand, the\r\npeculiar nature[279] of the disease under which Germanicus was\r\nlabouring, was alleged in Piso’s defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 72.—THE LUNGS: IN WHAT ANIMALS THEY ARE THE LARGEST, AND IN WHAT\r\nTHE SMALLEST. ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NOTHING BUT LUNGS IN THE INTERIOR OF\r\nTHE BODY. CAUSES WHICH PRODUCE EXTRAORDINARY SWIFTNESS IN ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeneath the heart are the lungs, the laboratory in which the\r\nrespiration is prepared. The use of these, is to draw in the air and\r\nthen expel it; for which purpose their substance is of a spongy nature,\r\nand filled with cavernous holes. Some few among the aquatic animals\r\nhave lungs, as we have already stated;[280] and among the rest of\r\nthose which are oviparous, they are small, of a fungous nature, and\r\ncontaining no blood; hence it is, that these animals do not experience\r\nthirst. It is for the same reason also, that frogs and seals are able\r\nto remain so long under water. The tortoise, too, although it has\r\nlungs of remarkable size, and extending throughout the whole of the\r\nshell, is also equally destitute of blood. The smaller the lungs are in\r\nproportion to the body, the greater is the swiftness of the animal. It\r\nis in the chameleon that the lungs are the largest in proportion to the\r\nbody; in which, in fact, it has no other viscera at all.[281]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 73.—THE LIVER: IN WHAT ANIMALS, AND IN WHAT PART THERE ARE TWO\r\nLIVERS FOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe liver is on the right side: in this part is situate what has been\r\ncalled the “head of the entrails,” and it is subject to considerable\r\nvariations. No liver[282] at all was found in a victim which was\r\nsacrificed by M. Marcellus, about the period when he was killed in\r\nbattle against Hannibal; while in a victim which was slain on the\r\nfollowing day, a double liver was found. It was wanting, also, in a\r\nvictim sacrificed by C. Marius, at Utica, and in one which was offered\r\nby the Emperor Caius[283] upon the calends of January,[284] on the\r\noccasion of his entering the year of the consulship in which he was\r\nslain: the same thing happened, also, to his successor, Claudius,\r\nin the month in which he was cut off[285] by poison. When the late\r\nEmperor Augustus was sacrificing at Spoletum, upon the first day of his\r\nentering on the imperial dignity, in six different victims the liver\r\nwas found rolled over within itself, from the very lowest lobe; and the\r\nanswer that was given by the diviners was to the effect that, in the\r\ncourse of the year, he would gain a twofold sway. It is of evil omen to\r\nfind an incision in the head of the entrails, except on occasions of\r\ndisquietude and alarm; for then it is significant of cutting all cares,\r\nand so putting an end to them. The hares that are found in the vicinity\r\nof Briletum[286] and Tharne, and in the Chersonnesus on the Propontis,\r\nhave a double liver; but, what is very singular, if they are removed to\r\nanother place, they will lose one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 74.—THE GALL; WHERE SITUATE, AND IN WHAT ANIMALS IT IS DOUBLE.\r\nANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO GALL, AND OTHERS IN WHICH IT IS NOT SITUATE IN\r\nTHE LIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the liver is the gall, which, however, does not exist in every\r\nanimal. At Chalcis, in Eubœa, none of the cattle have it, while in the\r\ncattle of the Isle of Naxos, it is of extraordinary size, and double,\r\nso that to a stranger either of these facts would appear as good as a\r\nprodigy. The horse, the mule, the ass, the stag, the roe-buck, the wild\r\nboar, the camel, and the dolphin have no gall, but some kinds of rats\r\nand mice have it. Some few men are without it, and such persons enjoy\r\nrobust health and a long life. There are some authors who say that the\r\ngall exists in the horse, not in the liver, but in the paunch, and that\r\nin the stag it is situate either in the tail or the intestines; and\r\nthat hence it is, that those parts are so bitter that dogs will not\r\ntouch them. The gall, in fact, is nothing else but the worst parts of\r\nthe blood purged off, and for this reason it is that it is so bitter:\r\nat all events, it is a well-known fact, that no animal has a liver\r\nunless it has blood as well. The liver receives the blood from the\r\nheart, to which it is united, and then disperses it in the veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 75.—THE PROPERTIES OF THE GALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the gall is black, it is productive of madness in man, and if it\r\nis wholly expelled death will ensue. Hence it is, too, that the word\r\n“bile” has been employed by us to characterize a harsh, embittered\r\ndisposition; so powerful are the effects of this secretion, when it\r\nextends its influence to the mind. In addition to this, when it is\r\ndispersed over the whole of the body, it deprives the eyes, even, of\r\ntheir natural colour; and when ejected, will tarnish copper vessels\r\neven, rendering everything black with which it comes in contact;\r\nso that no one ought to be surprised that it is the gall which\r\nconstitutes the venom of serpents. Those animals of Pontus which feed\r\non wormwood have no gall: in the raven, the quail, and the pheasant,\r\nthe gall-bladder is united to the renal parts, and, on one side only,\r\nto the intestines. In many animals, again, it is united only to the\r\nintestines, the pigeon, the hawk, and the murena, for example. In some\r\nfew birds it is situate in the liver; but it is in serpents and fishes\r\nthat it is the largest in proportion. With the greater part of birds,\r\nit extends all along throughout the intestines, as in the hawk and the\r\nkite. In some other birds, also, it is situate in the breast as well:\r\nthe gall, too, of the sea-calf is celebrated for its application to\r\nmany purposes. From the gall of the bull a colour is extracted like\r\nthat of gold. The aruspices have consecrated the gall to Neptune and\r\nthe influence of water. The Emperor Augustus found a double gall in a\r\nvictim which he was sacrificing on the day of his victory at Actium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 76.—IN WHAT ANIMALS THE LIVER INCREASES AND DECREASES WITH THE\r\nMOON. OBSERVATIONS OF THE ARUSPICES RELATIVE THERETO, AND REMARKABLE\r\nPRODIGIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said, that in the small liver of the mouse the number of lobes\r\ncorresponds to the day of the moon, and that they are found to be just\r\nas many in number as she is days old; in addition to which, it is said\r\nthat it increases at the winter solstice. In the rabbits of Bætica, the\r\nliver is always found to have a double lobe. Ants will not touch one\r\nlobe of the liver of the bramble-frog, in consequence of its poisonous\r\nnature, it is generally thought. The liver is remarkable for its powers\r\nof preservation, and sieges have afforded us remarkable instances of\r\nits being kept so long as a hundred years.[287]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 77.—THE DIAPHRAGM. THE NATURE OF LAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entrails of serpents and lizards are of remarkable length. It is\r\nrelated that—a most fortunate omen—Cæcina of Volaterræ beheld two\r\ndragons arising from the entrails of the victim; and this will not be\r\nat all incredible, if we are ready to believe that while King Pyrrhus\r\nwas sacrificing, the day upon which he died, the heads of the victims,\r\non being cut off, crawled along the ground and licked up their own\r\nblood. In man, the entrails are separated from the lower part of the\r\nviscera by a certain membrane, which is called the “præcordia,”[288]\r\nbecause it is extended in front of the heart; the Greeks have given it\r\nthe name of “phrenes.” All the principal viscera have been enclosed by\r\nNature, in her prudent foresight, in their own peculiar membranes, just\r\nlike so many sheaths, in fact. With reference to the diaphragm, there\r\nwas a peculiar reason for this wise provision of Nature, its proximity\r\nto the guts, and the chances that the food might possibly intercept the\r\nrespiration. It is to this organ that is attributed quick and ready\r\nwit, and hence it is that it has no fleshy parts, but is composed of\r\nfine sinews and membranes. This part is also the chief seat of gaiety\r\nof mind, a fact which is more particularly proved by the titillation\r\nof the arm-holes, to which the midriff extends; indeed, in no part\r\nof the body is the skin more fine; for this reason it is, also, that\r\nwe experience such peculiar pleasure in scratching the parts in its\r\nvicinity. Hence it is, that in battles and gladiatorial combats, many\r\npersons have been known to be pierced through the midriff, and to die\r\nin the act of laughing.[289]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 78.—THE BELLY: ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO BELLY. WHICH ARE THE ONLY\r\nANIMALS THAT VOMIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those animals which have a stomach, below the diaphragm the belly\r\nis situate. In other animals it is single, but in those which ruminate\r\nit is double; in those, again, which are destitute of blood, there is\r\nno belly, for the intestinal canal commences in some of them at the\r\nmouth, and returns to that part, as is the case with the sæpia and the\r\npolypus. In man it is connected with the extremity of the stomach, and\r\nthe same with the dog. These are the only creatures that have the belly\r\nmore narrow at the lower part; hence it is, too, that they are the only\r\nones that vomit, for on the belly being filled, the narrowness at its\r\nextremity precludes the food from passing; a thing that cannot possibly\r\nbe the case with the animals in which the belly is more capacious at\r\nthe extremity, and so leaves a free passage for the food to the lower\r\nparts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 79.—THE SMALL GUTS, THE FRONT INTESTINES, THE ANUS, THE COLON.\r\nTHE CAUSES OF THE INSATIATE VORACITY OF CERTAIN ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the belly we find in man and the sheep the “lactes,”[290] the\r\nplace of which in other animals is occupied by the “hillæ:”[291] it\r\nis through these organs that the food passes. We then find the larger\r\nintestines, which communicate with the anus, and which in man consist\r\nof extremely sinuous folds. Those animals which have the longest\r\nintestinal canal, are the most voracious; and those which have the\r\nbelly the most loaded with fat, are the least intelligent. There are\r\nsome birds, also, which have two receptacles; the one of which is the\r\ncrop, in which they stow away the food which they have just swallowed,\r\nwhile the other is the belly, into which they discharge the food when\r\nit is duly prepared and digested; this is the case with the domestic\r\nfowl, the ring-dove, the pigeon, and the partridge. The other birds\r\nare in general destitute of crop, but then they have a more capacious\r\ngorge, the jackdaw, the raven, and the crow, for instance: some, again,\r\nare constituted in neither manner, but have the belly close to the\r\ngorge, those, for instance, which have the neck very long and narrow,\r\nsuch as the porphyrio.[292]\r\n\r\nIn the solid-hoofed animals the belly is rough and hard, while in some\r\nland animals it is provided with rough asperities like teeth,[293]\r\nand in others, again, it has a reticulated surface like that of a\r\nfile. Those animals which have not the teeth on both sides, and do\r\nnot ruminate, digest the food in the belly, from whence it descends\r\nto the lower intestines. There is an organ in all animals attached\r\nin the middle to the navel, and in man similar in its lower part to\r\nthat of the swine, the name given thereto by the Greeks being “colon,”\r\na part of the body which is subject to excruciating pains.[294] In\r\ndogs this gut is extremely contracted, for which reason it is that\r\nthey are unable to ease it, except by great efforts, and not without\r\nconsiderable suffering. Those animals with which the food passes at\r\nonce from the belly through the straight intestine, are of insatiate\r\nappetite, as, for instance, the hind-wolf,[295] and among birds the\r\ndiver. The elephant has four[296] bellies; the rest of its intestines\r\nare similar to those of the swine, and the lungs are four times as\r\nlarge as those of the ox. The belly in birds is fleshy, and formed of\r\na callous substance. In that of young swallows there are found little\r\nwhite or pink pebbles, known by the name of “chelidonii,” and said to\r\nbe employed in magical incantations. In the second belly of the heifer\r\nthere is a black tufa found, round like a ball,[297] and of no weight\r\nto speak of: this, it is generally thought, is singularly efficacious\r\nin laborious deliveries, if it happens not to have touched the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 80.—THE OMENTUM: THE SPLEEN; ANIMALS WHICH ARE WITHOUT IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe belly and the intestines are covered with a caul known as the\r\n“omentum,” consisting of a fatty, thin membrane; except in the case of\r\nthose animals which are oviparous. To this membrane is attached the\r\nspleen, which lies on the left side, and opposite the liver: sometimes,\r\nindeed, it changes place with the liver, but such a case is looked upon\r\nas nothing less than a prodigy. Some persons imagine that a spleen of\r\nextremely diminutive size exists in the oviparous animals, as also in\r\nserpents; at all events, it is to be detected in the tortoise, the\r\ncrocodile, the lizard, and the frog; though it is equally certain that\r\nit does not exist in the bird known as the “ægocephalos,”[298] nor yet\r\nin those animals which are destitute of blood. The spleen sometimes\r\noffers a peculiar impediment in running, for which reason the region\r\nof the spleen is cauterized[299] in runners who are troubled with\r\npains there. It is said also, that if the spleen is removed[300] by an\r\nincision, animals may survive. There are some persons who think that\r\nwith the spleen man loses the power of laughing, and that excessive\r\nlaughter is caused by the overgrowth of it. There is a territory of\r\nAsia, known as Scepsis,[301] in which it is said that the spleen of the\r\ncattle is remarkably small, and that from thence it is that remedies\r\nfor diseases of the spleen have been introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 81.—THE KIDNEYS: ANIMALS WHICH HAVE FOUR KIDNEYS. ANIMALS WHICH\r\nHAVE NONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Briletum and Tharne[302] the stags have four kidneys: while, on\r\nthe other hand, those animals which have wings and scales have[303]\r\nnone. The kidneys adhere to the upper part of the loins. Among all\r\nanimals, the kidney on the right side is more elevated than the other,\r\nless fat, and drier. In both kidneys there is a certain streak of\r\nfat running from the middle, with the sole exception of those of the\r\nsea-calf. It is above the kidneys, also, that animals are fattest,\r\nand the accumulation of fat about them is often the cause of death in\r\nsheep. Small stones are sometimes found in the kidneys. All quadrupeds\r\nthat are viviparous have kidneys, but of those which are oviparous\r\nthe tortoise is the only one that has them; an animal which has all\r\nthe other viscera, but, like man, has the kidneys composed, to all\r\nappearance, of several kidneys, similar to those of the ox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 82.—THE BREAST: THE RIBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature has placed the breast, or, in other words, certain bones, around\r\nthe diaphragm and the organs of life, but not around the belly, for the\r\nexpansion of which it was necessary that room should be left. Indeed,\r\nthere is no animal that has any bones around the belly. Man is the only\r\ncreature that has a broad breast; in all others it is of a carinated\r\nshape, in birds more particularly, and most of all, the aquatic birds.\r\nThe ribs of man are only eight in number; swine have ten, the horned\r\nanimals thirteen, and serpents thirty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 83.—THE BLADDER: ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO BLADDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow the paunch, on the anterior side, lies the bladder, which\r\nis never found in any oviparous animal, with the exception of the\r\ntortoise, nor yet in any animal that has not lungs with blood, or\r\nin any one that is destitute of feet. Between it and the paunch are\r\ncertain arteries, which extend to the pubes, and are known as the\r\n“ilia.” In the bladder of the wolf there is found a small stone, which\r\nis called “syrites;” and in the bladders of some persons calculi are\r\nsometimes found, which produce most excruciating pains; small hairs,\r\nlike bristles, are also occasionally found in the bladder. This organ\r\nconsists of a membrane, which, when once wounded, does not[304]\r\ncicatrize, just like those in which the brain and the heart are\r\nenveloped: there are many kinds of membranes, in fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 84.—THE WOMB: THE WOMB OF THE SOW: THE TEATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen have all the same organs, except that adjoining to the bladder\r\nthere is one like a small sac,[305] from which circumstance it is\r\ncalled the “uterus.” Another name for this part is “loci;”[306] but in\r\nother animals it is known by the name of “vulva.” With the viper and\r\nother animals which generate their young within themselves, the womb\r\nis double; while with those which are oviparous, it is attached to the\r\ndiaphragm. In woman it has two concavities, one on either side: when\r\nthe matrix becomes displaced, it is productive of fatal effects, by\r\ncausing suffocation.[307] It is asserted that the cow, when pregnant,\r\ncarries her young only in the right concavity of the womb, and that\r\nthis is the case even when she produces twins. The womb of the sow is\r\nconsidered better eating if she has slipped her young, than if she\r\nhas duly brought forth: in the former case it is known by the name\r\nof “ejectitia,” in the latter it is called “porcaria.” The womb of\r\na sow that has farrowed only once is the most esteemed, and that of\r\nthose which have ceased farrowing, the least. After farrowing, unless\r\nthe animal is killed the same day, the womb is of a livid colour, and\r\nlean. This part, however, is not esteemed in a young sow, except just\r\nafter the first farrowing: indeed, it is much more highly valued in\r\nan animal of a more mature age, so long as it is not past breeding,\r\nor has been killed two days before farrowing, or two days after, or\r\nupon the day on which it has miscarried. The next best after that of a\r\nsow that has miscarried, is that of one that has been killed the day\r\nafter farrowing: indeed, the paps of this last, if the young have not\r\nbegun to suck, are excellent eating, while those of an animal that has\r\nmiscarried are very inferior. The ancients called this part by the name\r\nof “abdomen,” before it grew hard, and were not in the habit of killing\r\nswine while in a state of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 85.—ANIMALS WHICH HAVE SUET: ANIMALS WHICH DO NOT GROW FAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose among the horned animals which have teeth in one jaw only, and\r\npastern bones on the feet, produce tallow or suet. Those, on the other\r\nhand, which are cloven-footed, or have the feet divided into toes, and\r\nare without horns, have simple fat only. This fat becomes hard, and\r\nwhen quite cold turns brittle, and is always found at the extremity of\r\nthe flesh; while, on the other hand, the fat which lies between the\r\nskin and the flesh forms a kind of liquid juice. Some animals naturally\r\ndo not become fat, such as the hare and the partridge, for instance.\r\nAll fat animals, male as well as female, are mostly barren; and those\r\nwhich are remarkably fat become old the soonest. All animals have a\r\ncertain degree of fatness in the eyes. The fat in all animals is devoid\r\nof sensation, having neither arteries nor veins. With the greater part\r\nof animals, fatness is productive of insensibility; so much so, indeed,\r\nthat it has been said, that living swine have been gnawed even by\r\nmice.[308] It has been even asserted that the fat was drawn off from\r\nthe body of a son of L. Apronius, a man of consular rank, and that he\r\nwas thus relieved of a burden which precluded him from moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 86.—THE MARROW: ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO MARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marrow seems also to be formed of a similar material; in the young\r\nit is of a reddish colour, but it is white in the aged. It is only\r\nfound in those bones which are hollow, and not in the tibiæ of horses\r\nor dogs; for which reason it is, that when the tibia is broken, the\r\nbone will not reunite, a process which is effected[309] by the flow of\r\nthe marrow. The marrow is of a greasy nature in those animals which\r\nhave fat, and suetty in those with horns. It is full of nerves, and is\r\nfound only in the vertebral column[310] in those animals which have no\r\nbones, fishes, for instance. The bear has no marrow; and the lion has a\r\nlittle only in some few bones of the thighs and the brachia, which are\r\nof such extraordinary hardness that sparks may be emitted therefrom, as\r\nthough from a flint-stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 87.—BONES AND FISH-BONES: ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NEITHER. CARTILAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bones are hard, also, in those animals[311] which do not grow fat;\r\nthose of the ass are used by musicians for making flutes. Dolphins have\r\nbones, and not ordinary fish-bones; for they are viviparous. Serpents,\r\non the other hand, have bones like those of fish. Among aquatic\r\nanimals, the mollusks have no bones, but the body is surrounded with\r\ncircles of flesh, as in the sæpia and the cuttle-fish, for instance;\r\ninsects, also, are said to be equally destitute of bones. Among aquatic\r\nanimals, those which are cartilaginous have marrow in the vertebral\r\ncolumn; the sea-calf has cartilages, and no bones. The ears also,\r\nand the nostrils in all animals, when remarkably prominent, are made\r\nflexible by a remarkable provision of Nature, in order that they may\r\nnot be broken. When cartilage is once broken, it will not unite; nor\r\nwill bone, when cut, grow again, except in beasts of burden, between\r\nthe hoof and the pastern.\r\n\r\nMan increases in height till his twenty-first year, after which he\r\nfills out; but it is more particularly when he first arrives at the\r\nage of puberty that he seems to have untied a sort of knot in his\r\nexistence, and this especially when he has been overtaken by illness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 88.—THE NERVE: ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nerves[312] take their rise at the heart, and even surround it\r\nin the ox; they have the same nature and principle as the marrow. In\r\nall animals they are fastened to the lubricous surface of the bones,\r\nand so serve to fasten those knots in the body which are known as\r\narticulations or joints, sometimes lying between them, sometimes\r\nsurrounding them, and sometimes running from one to another; in\r\none place they are long and round, and in another broad, according\r\nas the necessity of each case may demand. When cut, they will not\r\nreunite, and if wounded, it is wonderful what excruciating pain they\r\ncause; though, if completely cut asunder, they are productive of none\r\nwhatever. Some animals are destitute of nerves, fish, for instance, the\r\nbodies of which are united by arteries, though even these are not to be\r\nfound in the mollusks. Wherever there are nerves found, it is the inner\r\nones that contract the limb, and the outer ones that extend it.\r\n\r\nAmong the nerves lie concealed the arteries, which are so many passages\r\nfor the spirit; and upon these float the veins, as conduits for the\r\nblood. The pulsation of the arteries is more especially perceptible\r\non the surface of the limbs, and afford indications of nearly every\r\ndisease, being either stationary, quickened, or retarded, conformably\r\nto certain measures and metrical laws, which depend on the age of\r\nthe patient, and which have been described with remarkable skill by\r\nHerophilus, who has been looked upon as a prophet in the wondrous art\r\nof medicine. These indications, however, have been hitherto neglected,\r\nin consequence of their remarkable subtilty and minuteness, though, at\r\nthe same time, it is by the observation of the pulse, as being fast or\r\nslow, that the health of the body, as regulating life, is ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 89.—THE ARTERIES; THE VEINS: ANIMALS WITHOUT ARTERIES OR VEINS.\r\nTHE BLOOD AND THE SWEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arteries are destitute of sensation, for they are devoid of blood.\r\nThey do not, all of them, however, contain the vital spirit, and when\r\none of them has been cut, it is only that part of the body that is\r\nreduced to a torpid state. Birds have neither veins nor arteries, which\r\nis the case also with serpents, tortoises, and lizards; and they have\r\nbut a very small proportion of blood. The veins, which are dispersed\r\nbeneath the whole skin in filaments of extreme thinness, terminate\r\nwith such remarkable fineness, that the blood is able to penetrate no\r\nfurther, or, indeed, anything else, except an extremely subtle humour\r\nwhich oozes forth from the skin in innumerable small drops, and is\r\nknown to us as “sweat.” The knot, and place of union of the veins, is\r\nthe navel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 90. (38.)—ANIMALS, THE BLOOD OF WHICH COAGULATES WITH THE\r\nGREATEST RAPIDITY: OTHER ANIMALS, THE BLOOD OF WHICH DOES NOT\r\nCOAGULATE. ANIMALS WHICH HAVE THE THICKEST BLOOD: THOSE THE BLOOD OF\r\nWHICH IS THE THINNEST: ANIMALS WHICH HAVE NO BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose animals in which the blood is more abundant and of an unctuous\r\nnature, are irascible; it is darker in males than in females, and in\r\nthe young than in the aged: the blood of the lower extremities is the\r\nthickest. There is great vitality, too, in the blood, and when it\r\nis discharged from the body, it carries the life with it: it is not\r\nsensible, however, of touch. Those animals in which the blood is the\r\nthickest are the most courageous, and those in which it is the thinnest\r\nthe most intelligent; while those, again, which have little or no\r\nblood are the most timorous of all. The blood of the bull coagulates\r\nand hardens the most speedily of all, and hence it is so particularly\r\ndeadly[313] when drunk. On the other hand, the blood of the wild boar,\r\nthe stag, the roe-buck, and oxen of all kinds, does not coagulate.\r\nBlood is of the richest quality in the ass, and the poorest in man.\r\nThose animals which have more than four feet have no blood. In animals\r\nwhich are very fat, the blood is less abundant than in others, being\r\nsoaked up by the fat. Man is the only creature from which the blood\r\nflows at the nostrils; some persons bleed at one nostril only, some\r\nat both, while others again void blood by the lower[314] parts. Many\r\npersons discharge blood from the mouth at stated periods, such, for\r\ninstance, as Macrinus Viscus, lately, a man of prætorian dignity, and\r\nVolusius Saturninus,[315] the Prefect of the City, who every year\r\ndid the same, and yet lived to beyond ninety. The blood is the only\r\nsubstance in the body that is sensible of any temporary increase, for a\r\nlarger quantity will come from the victims if they happen to have drunk\r\njust before they are sacrificed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 91.—ANIMALS WHICH ARE WITHOUT BLOOD AT CERTAIN PERIODS OF THE\r\nYEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose animals which conceal themselves[316] at certain periods of\r\nthe year, as already mentioned, have no blood at those times, with\r\nthe exception, indeed, of some very small drops about the heart. A\r\nmarvellous dispensation of Nature! and very similar to that witnessed\r\nin man, where the blood is sensible of various modifications from\r\nthe slightest causes; for not only, similarly to the bile, does it\r\nrush upwards to the face, but it serves also to indicate the various\r\ntendencies of the mind, by depicting shame, anger, and fear, in many\r\nways, either by the paleness of the features or their unusual redness;\r\nas, in fact, the redness of anger and the blush of modesty are quite\r\ndifferent things. It is a well-known fact, that when a man is in\r\nfear, the blood takes to flight and disappears, and that many persons\r\nhave been pierced through the body without losing one drop of blood;\r\na thing, however, which is only the case with man. But as to those\r\nanimals which we have already mentioned as changing[317] colour, they\r\nderive that colour from the reflection[318] of other objects; while, on\r\nthe other hand, man is the only one that has the elements which cause\r\nthese changes centred in himself. All diseases, as well as death, tend\r\nto absorb the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 92. (39.)—WHETHER THE BLOOD IS THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some persons who are of opinion that the fineness of the wit\r\ndoes not depend upon the thinness of the blood, but that animals are\r\nmore or less stupid in proportion to the skin or other coverings of\r\nthe body, as the oyster and the tortoise, for instance: that the hide\r\nof the ox and the bristles of the hog, in fact, offer a resistance to\r\nthe fine and penetrating powers of the air, and leave no passage for\r\nits transmission in a pure and liquid state. The same, they say, is\r\nthe case, too, with men, when the skin is very thick or callous, and\r\nso excludes the air. Just as if, indeed, the crocodile was not equally\r\nremarkable for the hardness of its skin and its extreme cunning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 93.—THE HIDE OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hide, too, of the hippopotamus is so thick, that lances,[319]\r\neven, are turned from it, and yet this animal has the intelligence\r\nto administer certain medicaments to itself. The hide, too, of the\r\nelephant makes bucklers that are quite impenetrable, and yet to it is\r\nascribed a degree of intelligence superior to that of any quadruped.\r\nThe skin itself is entirely devoid of sensation, and more particularly\r\nthat of the head; wherever it is found alone, and unaccompanied with\r\nflesh, if wounded, it will not unite, as in the cheek and on the\r\neyelid,[320] for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 94.—THE HAIR AND THE COVERING OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose animals which are viviparous, have hair; those which are\r\noviparous, have feathers, scales, or a shell, like the tortoise; or\r\nelse a purple skin, like the serpent. The lower part of all feathers is\r\nhollow; if cut, they will not grow again, but if pulled out, they will\r\nshoot afresh. Insects fly by the aid of a frail membrane; the wings\r\nof the fish[321] called the “swallow” are moistened in the sea, while\r\nthose of the bat which frequents our houses are dry; the wings of this\r\nlast animal have certain articulations as well. The hairs that issue\r\nfrom a thick skin are rough, while those on females are of a finer\r\nquality. Those found on the horse’s mane are more abundant, which is\r\nthe case also with the shoulders of the lion. The dasypus has hair in\r\nthe inside of the mouth even and under the feet, two features which\r\nTrogus has also attributed to the hare; from which the same author\r\nconcludes that hairy men are the most prone to lust. The most hairy\r\nof all animals is the hare. Man is the only creature that has hair as\r\nthe mark of puberty; and a person who is devoid of this, whether male\r\nor female, is sure to be sterile. The hair of man is partly born with\r\nhim, and in part produced after his birth. The last kind of hair will\r\nnot grow upon eunuchs, though that which has been born with them does\r\nnot fall off; which is the case also with women, in a great degree.\r\nStill however, there have been women known to be afflicted with falling\r\noff of the hair, just as some are to be seen with a fine down on the\r\nface, after the cessation of the menstrual discharge. In some men the\r\nhair that mostly shoots forth after birth will not grow spontaneously.\r\nThe hair of quadrupeds comes off every year, and grows again. That\r\nof the head in man grows the fastest, and next to it the hair of the\r\nbeard. When cut, the hairs shoot, not from the place where they have\r\nbeen cut, as is the case with grass, but at the root. The hair grows\r\nquickly in certain diseases, phthisis more particularly; it grows also\r\nwith rapidity in old age, and on the body after death. In persons of\r\na libidinous tendency the hair that is produced at birth falls off\r\nmore speedily, while that which is afterwards produced grows with the\r\ngreatest rapidity. In quadrupeds, the hair grows thicker in old age;\r\nbut on those with wool, it becomes thinner. Those quadrupeds which have\r\nthick hair on the back, have the belly quite smooth. From the hides\r\nof oxen, and that of the bull more especially, glue is extracted by\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 95.—THE PAPS: BIRDS THAT HAVE PAPS. REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED\r\nWITH THE DUGS OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan is the only male among animals that has nipples, all the rest\r\nhaving mere marks only in place of them. Among female animals even,\r\nthe only ones that have mammæ on the breast are those which can\r\nnurture their young. No oviparous animal has mammæ, and those only\r\nhave milk that are viviparous; the bat being the only winged animal\r\nthat has it. As for the stories that they tell, about the screech-owl\r\nejecting milk from its teats upon the lips of infants, I look upon it\r\nas utterly fabulous: from ancient times the name “strix,”[322] I am\r\naware, has been employed in maledictions, but I do not think it is well\r\nascertained what bird is really meant by that name.\r\n\r\n(40.) The female ass is troubled with pains in the teats after it has\r\nfoaled, and it is for that reason that at the end of six months it\r\nweans its young; while the mare suckles its young for nearly the whole\r\nyear. The solid-hoofed animals do not bear more than two young ones\r\nat a time: they all of them have two paps, and nowhere but between\r\nthe hind legs. Animals with cloven feet and with horns, such as the\r\ncow, for instance, have four paps, similarly situate, sheep and goats\r\ntwo. Those which produce a more numerous progeny, and those which\r\nhave toes on the feet, have a greater number of paps distributed in\r\na double row all along the belly, such as the sow, for instance; the\r\nbetter sorts have twelve, the more common ones two less: the same is\r\nthe case also with the female of the dog. Other animals, again, have\r\nfour paps situate in the middle of the belly, as the female panther;\r\nothers, again, two only, as the lioness. The female elephant has two\r\nonly, situate between the shoulders, and those not in the breast, but\r\nwithout it, and hidden in the arm-pits: none of the animals which\r\nhave toes have the paps between the hind legs. The sow presents the\r\nfirst teat to the first-born in each farrow, the first teat being the\r\none that is situate nearest to the throat. Each pig, too, knows its\r\nown teat, according to the order in which it was born, and draws its\r\nnourishment from that and no other: if its own suckling, too, should\r\nhappen to be withdrawn from any one of them, the pap will immediately\r\ndry up, and shrink back within the belly: if there should be only one\r\npig left of all the farrow, that pap alone which has been assigned for\r\nits nutriment when born, will continue to hang down for the purpose of\r\ngiving suck. The she-bear has four mammæ, the dolphin only two, at the\r\nbottom of the belly; they are not easily visible, and have a somewhat\r\noblique direction: this is the only animal which gives suck while in\r\nmotion. The balæna and sea-calf also suckle their young by teats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 96. (41.)—THE MILK: THE BIESTINGS. CHEESE; OF WHAT MILK CHEESE\r\nCANNOT BE MADE. RENNET; THE VARIOUS KINDS OF ALIMENT IN MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe milk that is secreted in a woman before her seventh month is\r\nuseless; but after that month, so long as the fœtus is healthy, the\r\nmilk is wholesome: many women, indeed, are so full of milk, that\r\nit will flow not only from the mammæ, but exudes at the arm-pits\r\neven.[323] Camels continue in milk until they are pregnant again.\r\nTheir milk, mixed in the proportion of one part to three of water,\r\nis considered a very pleasant beverage. The cow has no milk before\r\nit has calved, and that which immediately follows upon its bringing\r\nforth is known as the “colostra:”[324] if water is not mixed with it,\r\nit will coagulate, and assume the hardness of pumice. She-asses,\r\nas soon as they are pregnant, have milk in their udders; when the\r\npasturage is rich, it is fatal to their young to taste the mother’s\r\nmilk the first two days after birth; the kind of malady by which they\r\nare attacked is known by the name of “colostration.” Cheese cannot be\r\nmade from the milk of animals which have teeth on either jaw, from the\r\ncircumstance that their milk does not coagulate. The thinnest milk\r\nof all is that of the camel, and next to it that of the mare. The\r\nmilk of the she-ass is the richest of all, so much so, indeed, that\r\nit is often used instead of rennet. Asses’ milk is also thought to\r\nbe very efficacious in whitening the skin of females: at all events,\r\nPoppæa,[325] the wife of Domitius Nero, used always to have with her\r\nfive hundred asses with foal, and used to bathe the whole of her body\r\nin their milk, thinking that it also conferred additional suppleness on\r\nthe skin. All milk thickens by the action of fire, and becomes serous\r\nwhen exposed to cold. The milk of the cow produces more cheese than\r\nthat of the goat: when equal in quantity, it will produce nearly twice\r\nthe weight. The milk of animals which have more than four mammæ does\r\nnot produce cheese; and that is the best which is made of the milk of\r\nthose that have but two. The rennet of the fawn, the hare, and the kid\r\nis the most esteemed, but the best of all is that of the dasypus: this\r\nlast acts as a specific for diarrhœa, that animal being the only one\r\nwith teeth in both jaws, the rennet of which has that property. It is\r\na remarkable circumstance, that the barbarous nations which subsist\r\non milk have been for so many ages either ignorant of the merits of\r\ncheese, or else have totally disregarded it; and yet they understand\r\nhow to thicken milk and form therefrom an acrid kind of liquid with a\r\npleasant flavour, as well as a rich butter: this last is the foam[326]\r\nof milk, and is of a thicker consistency than the part which is known\r\nas the “serum.”[327] We ought not to omit that butter has certain of\r\nthe properties of oil, and that it is used for an ointment among all\r\nbarbarous nations, and among ourselves as well, for infants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 97. (42.)—VARIOUS KINDS OF CHEESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kinds of cheese that are most esteemed at Rome, where the various\r\ngood things of all nations are to be judged of by comparison, are those\r\nwhich come from the provinces of Nemausus,[328] and more especially the\r\nvillages there of Lesura and Gabalis;[329] but its excellence is only\r\nvery short-lived, and it must be eaten while it is fresh. The pastures\r\nof the Alps recommend themselves by two sorts of cheese; the Dalmatic\r\nAlps send us the Docleatian[330] cheese, and the Centronian[331] Alps\r\nthe Vatusican. The kinds produced in the Apennines are more numerous;\r\nfrom Liguria we have the cheese of Ceba,[332] which is mostly made\r\nfrom the milk of sheep; from Umbria we have that of Æsina, and from\r\nthe frontiers of Etruria and Liguria those of Luna, remarkable for\r\ntheir vast size, a single cheese weighing as much as a thousand pounds.\r\nNearer the City, again, we have the cheese of Vestinum, the best of\r\nthis kind being that which comes from the territory of Ceditium.[333]\r\nGoats also produce a cheese which has been of late held in the highest\r\nesteem, its flavour being heightened by smoking it. The cheese of this\r\nkind which is made at Rome is considered preferable to any other; for\r\nthat which is made in Gaul has a strong taste, like that of medicine.\r\nOf the cheeses that are made beyond sea, that of Bithynia[334] is\r\nusually considered the first in quality. That salt exists in pasture\r\nlands is pretty evident, from the fact that all cheese as it grows\r\nold contracts a saltish flavour, even where it does not appear to any\r\ngreat extent;[335] while at the same time it is equally well known\r\nthat cheese soaked in a mixture of thyme and vinegar will regain its\r\noriginal fresh flavour. It is said that Zoroaster lived thirty years in\r\nthe wilderness upon cheese, prepared in such a peculiar manner, that he\r\nwas insensible to the advances of old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 98. (43.)—DIFFERENCES OF THE MEMBERS OF MAN FROM THOSE OF OTHER\r\nANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the terrestrial animals, man is the only biped: he is also the\r\nonly one that has a throat, and shoulders, or “humeri,” parts in other\r\nanimals known by the name of “armi.” Man, too, is the only animal that\r\nhas the “ulna,” or elbow. Those animals which are provided with hands,\r\nhave flesh only on the interior of them, the outer part consisting of\r\nsinews and skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 99.—THE FINGERS, THE ARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome persons have six fingers on the hands. We read that C. Horatius,\r\na man of patrician rank, had two daughters, who for this reason\r\nhad the name of “Sedigitæ;” and we find mention made of Volcatius\r\nSedigitus,[336] as a famous poet. The fingers of man have three\r\njoints, the thumb only two, it bending in an opposite direction to\r\nall the other fingers. Viewed by itself, the movement of the thumb\r\nhas a sidelong direction, and it is much thicker than the rest of the\r\nfingers. The little finger is equal in length to the thumb, and two\r\nothers are also equal in length, the middle finger being the longest of\r\nall. Those quadrupeds which live by rapine have five toes on the fore\r\nfeet, and four on the hinder ones. The lion, the wolf, and the dog,\r\nwith some few others, have five claws on the hind feet, one of which\r\nhangs down near the joint of the leg. The other animals, also, which\r\nare of smaller size, have five toes. The two arms are not always equal\r\nin length: it is a well-known fact, that, in the school of gladiators\r\nbelonging to Caius Cæsar,[337] the Thracian Studiosus had the right arm\r\nlonger than the left. Some animals also use their fore-paws to perform\r\nthe duties of hands, and employ them in conveying food to the mouth as\r\nthey sit, the squirrel, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 100. (44.)—RESEMBLANCE OF THE APE TO MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the various kinds of apes, they offer a perfect resemblance to\r\nman in the face, the nostrils, the ears, and the eyelids; being the\r\nonly quadrupeds, in fact, that have eyelashes on the lower eyelid. They\r\nhave mammæ also on the breast, arms and legs, which bend in opposite\r\ndirections, and nails upon the hands and fingers, the middle finger\r\nbeing the longest. They differ somewhat from man in the feet; which,\r\nlike the hands, are of remarkable length, and have a print similar to\r\nthat of the palm of our hand. They have a thumb also, and articulations\r\nsimilar to those in man. The males differ from man in the sexual parts\r\nonly, while all the internal viscera exactly resemble those of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 101. (45.)—THE NAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that the nails are the terminations of the\r\nsinews. All animals which have fingers have nails as well. In the ape\r\nthey are long and overlapping,[338] like a tile, while in man they are\r\nbroad: they will grow even after death. In the beasts of prey they\r\nare hooked, while in others, such as the dog, for instance, they are\r\nstraight, with the exception, indeed, of the one which is attached\r\nto the leg in most of them. All the animals which have feet [and not\r\nhoofs], have toes as well, except the elephant; he, also, would appear\r\nto have toes, five in number, but rudely developed, undivided, and\r\nhardly distinct from one another, bearing a nearer resemblance, in\r\nfact, to hoofs than to claws. In the elephant the fore-feet are the\r\nlargest, and in the hind-feet there are short joints. This animal is\r\nable, also, to bend the hams inward like a man, while in all the others\r\nthe joints of the hinder legs bend in a contrary direction to those of\r\nthe fore ones. Those animals which are viviparous bend the fore-leg\r\nforward, while the joint of the hind-leg is directed backward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 102.—THE KNEES AND THE HAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn man the knee and the elbow bend contrary ways; the same is the case,\r\ntoo, with the bear and the ape, and it is for this reason that they\r\nare not so swift of foot as other animals. Those quadrupeds which are\r\noviparous, such as the crocodile and the lizard, bend the knee of the\r\nfore-leg backwards, and that of the hind-leg forwards; their thighs\r\nare placed on them obliquely, in a similar manner to a man’s thumb;\r\nwhich is the case also with the multipede insects, the hind-legs only\r\nexcepted of such as leap. Birds, like quadrupeds, have the joints of\r\nthe wings bending forwards, but those of the legs backwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 103.—PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY TO WHICH CERTAIN RELIGIOUS IDEAS ARE\r\nATTACHED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the usages of various nations, certain religious\r\nideas have been attached to the knees. It is the knees that suppliants\r\nclasp, and it is to these that they extend their hands; it is the knees\r\nthat they worship like so many altars, as it were; perhaps, because in\r\nthem is centred the vital strength. For in the joint of either knee,\r\nthe right as well as the left, there is on the fore-side of each a\r\ncertain empty space, which bears a strong resemblance to a mouth, and\r\nthrough which, like the throat, if it is once pierced, the vital powers\r\nescape.[339] There are also certain religious ideas attached to other\r\nparts of the body, as is testified in raising the back of the right\r\nhand to the lips, and extending it as a token of good faith. It was\r\nthe custom of the ancient Greeks, when in the act of supplication, to\r\ntouch the chin. The seat of the memory lies in the lower part of the\r\near, which we touch when we summon a witness to depose upon memory to\r\nan arrest.[340] The seat, too, of Nemesis[341] lies behind the right\r\near, a goddess which has never yet found a Latin name, no, not in the\r\nCapitol even. It is to this part that we apply the finger next the\r\nlittle finger, after touching the mouth with it, when we silently ask\r\npardon of the gods for having let slip an indiscreet word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 104.—VARICOSE VEINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMen only, in general, have varicose veins in the legs, women but very\r\nrarely. We are informed by Oppius, that C. Marius, who was seven times\r\nconsul, was the only man ever known to be able to have them extracted\r\nin a standing position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 105.—THE GAIT, THE FEET, THE LEGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll animals take a right-hand direction when they first begin to walk,\r\nand lie down on the left side. While the other animals walk just as it\r\nmay happen, the lion only and the camel walk foot by foot, or in such a\r\nway that the left foot never passes the right, but always comes behind\r\nit. Men have the largest feet; in every kind of animal the female has\r\nthe smallest. Man only[342] has calves, and flesh upon the legs: we\r\nfind it stated by authors, however, that there was once an Egyptian who\r\nhad no calves on his legs. All men, too, with some few exceptions, have\r\na sole to the foot. It is from these exceptional cases that persons\r\nhave obtained the names of Plancus,[343] Plautus, Pansa, and Scaurus;\r\njust as, from the malformation of the legs, we find persons called\r\nVarus,[344] Vacia, and Vatinius, all which blemishes are to be seen\r\nin quadrupeds also. Animals which have no horns have a solid hoof,\r\nfrom which circumstance it is used by them as a weapon of offence, in\r\nplace of horns; such animals as these are also destitute of pastern\r\nbones, but those which have cloven hoofs have them; while those, again,\r\nwhich have toes have none, nor are they ever found in the fore-feet of\r\nanimals. The camel has pastern bones like those of the ox, but somewhat\r\nsmaller, the feet being cloven, with a slight line of division, and\r\nhaving a fleshy sole, like that of the bear: hence it is, that in a\r\nlong journey, the animal becomes fatigued, and the foot cracks, if it\r\nis not shod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 106. (46.)—HOOFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horn of the hoof grows again in no animals except beasts of burden.\r\nThe swine in some places in Illyricum have solid hoofs. Nearly all\r\nthe horned animals are cloven-footed, no animal having solid hoofs\r\nand two horns. The Indian ass is only a one-horned animal, and the\r\noryx is both one-horned and cloven-footed. The Indian ass[345] is the\r\nonly solid-hoofed animal that has pastern-bones. As to swine, they are\r\nlooked upon as a sort of mongrel race, with a mixture of both kinds,\r\nand hence it is that their ankle-bones are so misshapen. Those authors\r\nwho have imagined that man has similar pastern-bones, are easily to\r\nbe confuted. The lynx is the only one among the animals that have the\r\nfeet divided into toes, that has anything bearing a resemblance to a\r\npastern-bone; while with the lion it is more crooked still. The great\r\npastern-bone is straight, and situate in the joints of the foot; it\r\nprojects outwards in a convex protuberance, and is held fast in its\r\nvertebration by certain ligaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 107. (47.)—THE FEET OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong birds, some have the feet divided into toes, while others, again,\r\nare broad and flatfooted—in others, which partake of the intermediate\r\nnature of both, the toes are divided, with a wide space between them.\r\nAll birds, however, have four toes—three in front, and one on the\r\nheel; this last, however, is wanting in some that have long legs. The\r\niynx[346] is the only bird that has two toes on each side of the leg.\r\nThis bird also protrudes a long tongue similar to that of the serpent,\r\nand it can turn the neck quite round and look backwards; it has great\r\ntalons, too, like those of the jackdaw. Some of the heavier birds\r\nhave spurs also upon the legs; but none of those have them which have\r\ncrooked talons as well. The long-footed birds, as they fly, extend\r\nthe legs towards the tail, while those that have short legs hold them\r\ncontracted close to the middle of the body. Those authors who deny\r\nthat there is any bird without feet, assert that those even which are\r\ncalled apodes,[347] are not without them, as also the oce, and the\r\ndrepanis,[348] which last is a bird but very rarely seen. Serpents,\r\ntoo, have been seen with feet like those of the goose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 108. (48.)—THE FEET OF ANIMALS, FROM THOSE HAVING TWO FEET TO\r\nTHOSE WITH A HUNDRED.—DWARFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong insects, those which have hard eyes have the fore-feet long, in\r\norder that from time to time they may rub the eyes with their feet, as\r\nwe frequently see done by flies. The insects which have long hind-feet\r\nare able to leap, the locust, for instance. All these insects have six\r\nfeet: and some of the spiders have two very long feet in addition.\r\nThey have, all of them, three joints. We have already[349] stated that\r\nmarine insects have eight feet, such as the polypus, the sæpia, the\r\ncuttle-fish, and the crab, animals which move their arms in a contrary\r\ndirection to their feet, which last they move around as well as\r\nobliquely: they are the only animals the feet of which have a rounded\r\nform. Other insects have two feet to regulate their movements; in the\r\ncrab, and in that only, these duties are performed by four. The land\r\nanimals which exceed this number of feet, as most of the worms,[350]\r\nnever have fewer than twelve feet, and some, indeed, as many as a\r\nhundred. The number of feet is never uneven in any animal. Among the\r\nsolid-hoofed animals, the legs are of their proper length from the\r\nmoment of their birth, after which they may with more propriety be said\r\nto extend themselves than to increase in growth: hence it is, that in\r\ninfancy they are able to scratch their ears with the hind feet, a thing\r\nwhich, when they grow older, they are not able to do, because their\r\nincrease of growth affects only the superficies of the body. It is for\r\nthe same reason also, that they are only able to graze at first by\r\nbending the knees, until such time as the neck has attained its proper\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n(49.) There are dwarfs to be found among all animals, and among birds\r\neven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 109.—THE SEXUAL PARTS.—HERMAPHRODITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken sufficiently[351] at length of those animals,\r\nthe males of which have the sexual parts behind. In the wolf, the\r\nfox, the weasel, and the ferret, these parts are bony; and it is the\r\ngenitals of the last-mentioned animal that supply the principal\r\nremedies for calculus in the human bladder. It is said also that the\r\ngenitals of the bear are turned into a horny substance the moment it\r\ndies. Among the peoples of the East the very best bow-strings are those\r\nwhich are made of the member of the camel. These parts also, among\r\ndifferent nations, are made the object of certain usages[352] and\r\nreligious observances; and the Galli,[353] the priests of the Mother\r\nof the gods, are in the habit of castrating themselves, without any\r\ndangerous results. On the other hand, there is in some few women a\r\nmonstrous resemblance to the male conformation, while hermaphrodites\r\nappear to partake of the nature of both. Instances of this last\r\nconformation were seen in quadrupeds in Nero’s reign, and for the first\r\ntime, I imagine; for he ostentatiously paraded hermaphrodite horses\r\nyoked to his car, which had been found in the territory of the Treviri,\r\nin Gaul; as if, indeed, it was so remarkably fine a sight to behold the\r\nruler of the earth seated in a chariot drawn by monstrosities!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 110.—THE TESTES—THE THREE CLASSES OF EUNUCHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sheep and cattle the testes hang down to the legs, while in the\r\nboar they are knit up close to the body. In the dolphin they are\r\nvery long, and are concealed in the lower part of the belly. In the\r\nelephant, also, they are quite concealed. In oviparous animals they\r\nadhere to the interior of the loins: these animals are the most speedy\r\nin the venereal congress. Fishes and serpents have no testes, but in\r\nplace of them they have two veins, which run from the renal region to\r\nthe genitals. The bird known as the “buteo,”[354] has three testes.\r\nMan is the only creature in which the testes are ever broken, either\r\naccidentally or by some natural malady; those who are thus afflicted\r\nform a third class of half men, in addition to hermaphrodites and\r\neunuchs. In all species of animals the male is more courageous than the\r\nfemale, with the exception of the panther and the bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 111. (50.)—THE TAILS OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly all the animals, both viviparous as well as oviparous, with\r\nthe exception of man and the ape, have tails in proportion to the\r\nnecessities of the body. In animals with bristles the tail is bare, as\r\nin the boar, for instance. In those that are shaggy, it is small, such\r\nas the bear; while in those animals that have long hair, the tail is\r\nlong also, the horse, for instance. The tail of a lizard or serpent, if\r\ncut off, will grow again. The tail governs the movements of the fish\r\nlike a rudder, and turning from side to side, to the right or to the\r\nleft, impels it onwards, acting in some degree like an oar. A double\r\ntail is sometimes found in lizards. In oxen, the stalk of the tail is\r\nof remarkable length, and is covered with rough hair at the extremity.\r\nIn the ass, too, it is longer than in the horse, but in beasts of\r\nburden it is covered with bristly hairs. The tail of the lion, at the\r\nextremity, is like that of the ox and the field-mouse; but this is not\r\nthe case with the panther. In the fox and the wolf it is covered with\r\nlong hair, as in sheep, in which it is longer also. In swine, the tail\r\nis curled; among dogs, those that are mongrels carry it close beneath\r\nthe belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 112. (51.)—THE DIFFERENT VOICES OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAristotle[355] is of opinion that no animal has a voice which does\r\nnot respire, and that hence it is that there is no voice in insects,\r\nbut only a noise, through the circulation of the air in the interior,\r\nand its resounding, by reason of its compression. Some insects,\r\nagain, he says, emit a sort of humming noise, such as the bee, for\r\ninstance; others a shrill, long-drawn note, like the grasshopper, the\r\ntwo cavities beneath the thorax receiving the air, which, meeting a\r\nmoveable membrane within, emits a sound by the attrition.—Also that\r\nflies, bees, and other insects of that nature, are only heard while\r\nthey are flying, and cease to be heard the moment they settle, and\r\nthat the sound which they emit proceeds from the friction and the air\r\nwithin them, and not from any act of respiration. At all events, it is\r\ngenerally believed that the locust emits a sound by rubbing together\r\nthe wings and thighs, and that among the aquatic animals the scallop\r\nmakes a certain noise as it flies.[356] Mollusks, however, and the\r\ntestaceous animals have no voice and emit no sounds. As for the other\r\nfishes, although they are destitute of lungs and the tracheal artery,\r\nthey are not entirely without the power of emitting certain sounds: it\r\nis only a mere joke to say that the noise which they make is produced\r\nby grating their teeth together. The fish, too, that is found in the\r\nriver Acheloüs, and is known as the boar-fish,[357] makes a grunting\r\nnoise, as do some others which we have previously[358] mentioned. The\r\noviparous animals hiss: in the serpent this hissing is prolonged, in\r\nthe tortoise it is short and abrupt. Frogs make a peculiar noise of\r\ntheir own, as already stated;[359] unless, indeed, this, too, is to\r\nbe looked upon as a matter of doubt; but their noise originates in\r\nthe mouth, and not in the thorax. Still, however, in reference to\r\nthis subject, the nature of the various localities exercises a very\r\nconsiderable influence, for in Macedonia, it is said, the frogs are\r\ndumb, and the same in reference to the wild boars there. Among birds,\r\nthe smaller ones chirp and twitter the most, and more especially\r\nabout the time of pairing. Others, again, exercise their voice while\r\nfighting, the quail, for instance; others before they begin to fight,\r\nsuch as the partridge; and others when they have gained the victory,\r\nthe dunghill cock, for instance. The males in these species have a\r\npeculiar note of their own, while in others, the nightingale for\r\nexample, the male has the same note as the female.\r\n\r\nSome birds sing all the year round, others only at certain times of the\r\nyear, as we have already mentioned when speaking of them individually.\r\nThe elephant produces a noise similar to that of sneezing, by the aid\r\nof the mouth, and independently of the nostrils; but by means of the\r\nnostrils it emits a sound similar to the hoarse braying of a trumpet.\r\nIt is only in the bovine race that the voice of the female is the\r\ndeepest, it being in all other kinds of animals more shrill than that\r\nof the male; it is the same also with the male of the human race when\r\ncastrated. The infant at its birth is never heard to utter a cry before\r\nit has entirely left the uterus: it begins to speak at the end of the\r\nfirst year. A son of Crœsus,[360] however, spoke when only six months\r\nold, and, while yet wielding the child’s rattle, afforded portentous\r\nomens, for it was at the same period that his father’s empire fell.\r\nThose children which begin to speak the soonest, begin to walk the\r\nlatest. The human voice acquires additional strength at the fourteenth\r\nyear; but in old age it becomes more shrill again, and there is no\r\nliving creature in which it is subject to more frequent changes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the preceding, there are still some singular\r\ncircumstances that deserve to be mentioned with reference to the voice.\r\nIf saw-dust or sand is thrown down in the orchestra of a theatre, or if\r\nthe walls around are left in a rough state, or empty casks are placed\r\nthere, the voice is absorbed; while, on the other hand, if the wall\r\nis quite straight, or if built in a concave form, the voice will move\r\nalong it, and will convey words spoken in the slightest whisper from\r\none end[361] to the other, if there is no inequality in the surface to\r\nimpede its progress. The voice, in man, contributes in a great degree\r\nto form his physiognomy, for we form a knowledge of a man before we\r\nsee him by hearing his voice, just as well[362] as if we had seen him\r\nwith our eyes. There are as many kinds of voices, too, as there are\r\nindividuals in existence, and each man has his own peculiar voice, just\r\nas much as his own peculiar physiognomy. Hence it is, that arises that\r\nvast diversity of nations and languages throughout the whole earth:\r\nin this, too, originate the many tunes, measures, and inflexions that\r\nexist. But, before all other things, it is the voice that serves to\r\nexpress our sentiments,[363] a power that distinguishes us from the\r\nbeasts; just as, in the same way, the various shades and differences in\r\nlanguage that exist among men have created an equally marked difference\r\nbetween us and the brutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 113. (52.)—SUPERFLUOUS LIMBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupernumerary limbs, when they grow on animals, are of no use, which\r\nis the case also with the sixth finger, when it grows on man. It\r\nwas thought proper in Egypt to rear a human monster, that had two\r\nadditional eyes in the back part of the head; it could not see with\r\nthem, however.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 114.—SIGNS OF VITALITY AND OF THE MORAL DISPOSITION OF MAN, FROM\r\nTHE LIMBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am greatly surprised that Aristotle has not only believed, but has\r\neven committed it to writing, that there are in the human body certain\r\nprognostics of the duration of life. Although I am quite convinced of\r\nthe utter futility of these remarks, and am of opinion that they ought\r\nnot to be published without hesitation, for fear lest each person might\r\nbe anxiously looking out for these prognostics in his own person, I\r\nshall still make some slight mention of the subject, seeing that so\r\nlearned a man as Aristotle did not treat it with contempt. He has set\r\ndown the following as indications of a short life—few teeth, very long\r\nfingers, a leaden colour, and numerous broken lines in the palm of the\r\nhand. On the other hand, he looks upon the following as prognostics of\r\na long life—stooping in the shoulders, one or two long unbroken lines\r\nin the hand, a greater number than two-and-thirty teeth, and large\r\nears. He does not, I imagine, require that all these symptoms should\r\nunite in one person, but looks upon them as individually significant:\r\nin my opinion, however, they are utterly frivolous, all of them,\r\nalthough they obtain currency among the vulgar. Our own writer, Trogus,\r\nhas in a similar manner set down the physiognomy as indicative of the\r\nmoral disposition; one of the very gravest of the Roman authors, whose\r\nown[364] words I will here subjoin:—\r\n\r\n“Where the forehead is broad, it is significant of a dull and sluggish\r\nunderstanding beneath; and where it is small, it indicates an unsteady\r\ndisposition. A rounded forehead denotes an irascible temper, it seeming\r\nas though the swelling anger had left its traces there. Where the\r\neye-brows are extended in one straight line, they denote effeminacy\r\nin the owner, and when they are bent downwards towards the nose, an\r\naustere disposition. On the other hand, when the eye-brows are bent\r\ntowards the temples, they are indicative of a sarcastic disposition;\r\nbut when they lie very low, they denote malice and envy. Long eyes\r\nare significant of a spiteful, malicious nature; and where the\r\ncorners of the eyes next the nose are fleshy, it is a sign also of a\r\nwicked disposition. If the white of the eye is large, it bears tokens\r\nof impudence, while those who are incessantly closing the eyelids\r\nare inconstant. Largeness of the ears is a sign of loquacity and\r\nfoolishness.” Thus much of what Trogus says.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 115. (53.)—RESPIRATION AND NUTRIMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breath of the lion is fetid, and that of the bear quite\r\npestilential; indeed, no beast will touch anything with which its\r\nbreath has come in contact, and substances which it has breathed upon\r\nwill become putrid sooner than others. It is in man only that Nature\r\nhas willed that the breath should become tainted in several ways,\r\neither through faultiness in the victuals or the teeth, or else, as is\r\nmore generally the case, through extreme old age. Our breath in itself\r\nwas insensible to all pain, utterly devoid as it was of all powers\r\nof touch and feeling, without which there can be no sensation; ever\r\nrenewed, it was always forthcoming, destined to be the last adjunct\r\nthat shall leave the body, and the only one to remain when all is\r\ngone beside; it drew, in fine, its origin from heaven. In spite of\r\nall this, however, certain penalties were discovered to be indicted\r\nupon it, so that the very substance by the aid of which we live might\r\nbecome a torment to us in life. This inconvenience is more particularly\r\nexperienced among the Parthians, from their youth upwards, on account\r\nof the indiscriminate use of food among them; and, indeed, their very\r\nexcess in wine causes their breath to be fetid. The grandees, however,\r\nof that nation have a remedy for bad breath in the pips of the Assyrian\r\ncitron,[365] which they mix with their food, and the aroma of which\r\nis particularly agreeable. The breath of the elephant will attract\r\nserpents from their holes, while that of the stag scorches them. We\r\nhave already made mention[366] of certain races of men who could by\r\nsuction extract from the body the venom of serpents; and swine will\r\neven eat serpents,[367] which to other animals are poisonous. All those\r\ncreatures which we have spoken of as insects, can be killed by merely\r\nsprinkling them with oil.[368] Vultures, which are put to flight by\r\nunguents, are attracted by other odours: the beetle, too, is attracted\r\nby the rose. The scorpion puts to death certain serpents. The Scythians\r\ndip their arrows in the poison of serpents and human blood: against\r\nthis frightful composition there is no remedy, for with the slightest\r\ntouch it is productive of instant death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 116.—ANIMALS WHICH WHEN FED UPON POISON DO NOT DIE, AND THE FLESH\r\nOF WHICH IS POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe animals which feed upon poison have been already[369] mentioned.\r\nSome of them, which are harmless of themselves, become noxious if\r\nfed upon venomous substances. The wild boar of Pamphylia and the\r\nmountainous parts of Cilicia, after having devoured a salamander,\r\nwill become poisonous to those who eat its flesh; and yet the danger\r\nis quite imperceptible by reason of any peculiarity in the smell and\r\ntaste. The salamander, too, will poison either water or wine, in which\r\nit happens to be drowned; and what is more, if it has only drunk\r\nthereof, the liquid becomes poisonous. The same is the case, too, with\r\nthe frog known to us as the bramble-frog. So numerous are the snares\r\nthat are laid in wait for life! Wasps greedily devour the flesh of the\r\nserpent, a nutriment which renders their stings fatal; so vast is the\r\ndifference to be found between one kind of food and another. In the\r\ncountry, too, of the Ichthyophagi,[370] as we learn from Theophrastus,\r\nthe oxen are fed upon fish, but only when alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 117.—REASONS FOR INDIGESTION. REMEDIES FOR CRUDITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most wholesome nutriment for man is plain food. An accumulation of\r\nflavours is injurious, and still more so, if heightened by sauces. All\r\nacrid elements are difficult of digestion, and the same is the case if\r\nfood is devoured greedily, or in too large quantities. Food is also\r\nless easily digested in summer than in winter, and in old age than in\r\nyouth. The vomits which man has invented, by way of remedy for this\r\nevil, render the body more cold, and are more particularly injurious to\r\nthe eyes and teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 118.—FROM WHAT CAUSES CORPULENCE ARISES; HOW IT MAY BE REDUCED.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigestion during sleep is more productive of corpulence than strength.\r\nHence it is, that it is preferable for athletes to quicken digestion\r\nby walking. Watching, at night more especially, promotes digestion of\r\nthe food.\r\n\r\n(54.) The size of the body is increased by eating sweet and fatty\r\nsubstances, as well as by drinking, while, on the other hand, it is\r\ndiminished by eating dry, acrid, or cold substances, and by abstaining\r\nfrom drink. Some animals of Africa, as well as sheep, drink but once\r\nevery four days. Abstinence from food for seven days, even, is not of\r\nnecessity fatal to man; and it is a well-known fact, that many persons\r\nhave not died till after an abstinence of eleven days. Man is the only\r\nanimal that is ever attacked with an insatiate[371] craving for food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 119.—WHAT THINGS, BY MERELY TASTING OF THEM, ALLAY HUNGER AND\r\nTHIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some substances which, tasted in small\r\nquantities only, appease hunger and thirst, and keep up the strength,\r\nsuch as butter, for instance, cheese made of mares’ milk, and\r\nliquorice. But the most pernicious thing of all, and in every station\r\nof life, is excess, and more especially excess in food; in fact, it\r\nis the most prudent plan to retrench everything that may be possibly\r\nproductive of injury. Let us, however, now pass on to the other\r\nbranches of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, two\r\nthousand, two hundred, and seventy.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—M.

It now remains for us to speak of the vegetable\r\nproductions of the earth, which are equally far from being destitute\r\nof a vital spirit,[416] (for, indeed, nothing can live without it),\r\nthat we may then proceed to describe the minerals extracted from\r\nit, and so none of the works of Nature may be passed by in silence.\r\nLong, indeed, were these last bounties of hers concealed beneath the\r\nground, the trees and forests being regarded as the most valuable\r\nbenefits conferred by Nature upon mankind. It was from the forest that\r\nman drew his first aliment, by the leaves of the trees was his cave\r\nrendered more habitable, and by their bark was his clothing supplied;\r\neven at this very day,[417] there are nations that live under similar\r\ncircumstances to these. Still more and more, then, must we be struck\r\nwith wonder and admiration, that from a primæval state such as this, we\r\nshould now be cleaving the mountains for their marbles, visiting the\r\nSeres[418] to obtain our clothing, seeking the pearl in the depths of\r\nthe Red Sea, and the emerald in the very bowels of the earth. For our\r\nadornment with these precious stones it is that we have devised those\r\nwounds which we make in our ears; because, forsooth, it was deemed not\r\nenough to carry them on our hands, our necks, and our hair, if we did\r\nnot insert them in our very flesh as well. It will be only proper,\r\nthen, to follow the order of human inventions, and to speak of the\r\ntrees before treating of other subjects; thus may we trace up to their\r\nvery origin the manners and usages of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (1.)—THE EARLY HISTORY OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trees formed the first temples of the gods, and even at the\r\npresent day, the country people, preserving in all their simplicity\r\ntheir ancient rites, consecrate the finest among their trees to some\r\ndivinity;[419] indeed, we feel ourselves inspired to adoration, not\r\nless by the sacred groves and their very stillness, than by the statues\r\nof the gods, resplendent as they are with gold and ivory. Each kind of\r\ntree remains immutably consecrated to its own peculiar divinity, the\r\nbeech[420] to Jupiter,[421] the laurel to Apollo, the olive to Minerva,\r\nthe myrtle to Venus, and the poplar to Hercules: besides which, it is\r\nour belief that the Sylvans, the Fauns, and various kinds of goddess\r\nNymphs, have the tutelage of the woods, and we look upon those deities\r\nas especially appointed to preside over them by the will of heaven. In\r\nmore recent times, it was the trees that by their juices, more soothing\r\neven than corn, first mollified the natural asperity of man; and it is\r\nfrom these that we now derive the oil of the olive that renders the\r\nlimbs so supple, the draught of wine that so efficiently recruits the\r\nstrength, and the numerous delicacies which spring up spontaneously\r\nat the various seasons of the year, and load our tables with their\r\nviands—tables to replenish which, we engage in combat with wild beasts,\r\nand seek for the fishes which have fattened upon the dead corpse of the\r\nshipwrecked mariner—indeed, it is only at the second[422] course, after\r\nall, that the produce of the trees appears.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to this, the trees have a thousand other uses, all\r\nof which are indispensable to the full enjoyment of life. It is by\r\nthe aid of the tree that we plough the deep, and bring near to us far\r\ndistant lands; it is by the aid of the tree, too, that we construct our\r\nedifices. The statues, even, of the deities were formed of the wood\r\nof trees, in the days when no value had been set as yet on the dead\r\ncarcase[423] of a wild beast, and when, luxury not yet deriving its\r\nsanction from the gods themselves, we had not to behold, resplendent\r\nwith the same ivory, the heads of the divinities[424] and the feet of\r\nour tables. It is related that the Gauls, separated from us as they\r\nwere by the Alps, which then formed an almost insurmountable bulwark,\r\nhad, as their chief motive for invading Italy, its dried figs, its\r\ngrapes, its oil, and its wine, samples[425] of which had been brought\r\nback to them by Helico, a citizen of the Helvetii, who had been staying\r\nat Rome, to practise there as an artizan. We may offer some excuse,\r\nthen, for them, when we know that they came in quest of these various\r\nproductions, though at the price even of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—EXOTIC TREES. WHEN THE PLANE-TREE FIRST APPEARED IN ITALY, AND\r\nWHENCE IT CAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut who is there that will not, with good reason, be surprised to learn\r\nthat a tree has been introduced among us from a foreign clime for\r\nnothing but its shade? I mean the plane,[426] which was first brought\r\nacross the Ionian Sea to the Isle[427] of Diomedes, there to be planted\r\nat his tomb, and was afterwards imported thence into Sicily, being\r\none of the very first exotic trees that were introduced into Italy.\r\nAt the present day, however, it has penetrated as far as the country\r\nof the Morini, and occupies even a tributary[428] soil; in return for\r\nwhich those nations have to pay a tax for the enjoyment of its shade.\r\nDionysius the Elder, one of the tyrants of Sicily, had plane-trees\r\nconveyed to the city of Rhegium, where they were looked upon as the\r\ngreat marvel of his palace, which was afterwards converted into a\r\ngymnasium. These trees did not, however, in that locality, attain any\r\nvery great height. I find it also stated by some authors, that there\r\nwere some other instances, in those days even, of plane-trees being\r\nfound in Italy, and I find some mentioned by name as existing in\r\nSpain.[429]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—THE NATURE OF THE PLANE-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis circumstance took place about the time of the capture of the\r\nCity of Rome; and to such high honour, in the course of time, did the\r\nplane-tree attain, that it was nurtured by pouring wine upon it, it\r\nbeing found that the roots were greatly strengthened by doing[430] so.\r\nThus have we taught the very trees, even, to be wine-bibbers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5.—REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE PLANE-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first plane-trees that were spoken of in terms of high admiration\r\nwere those which adorned the walks of the Academy[431] at Athens—[in\r\none of which], the roots extended a distance of thirty-three cubits,\r\nand spread far beyond its branches. At the present day, there is a\r\nvery famous plane in Lycia, situate in close proximity to a fountain\r\nof the most refreshing coolness; standing near the road, with the\r\ncavity in its interior, it forms a species of house eighty-one feet\r\nin width. Its summit, too, presents the foliage of a grove, while\r\nit shields itself with huge branches, each of which would equal an\r\nordinary tree in size, as it throws its lengthened shade across the\r\nfields. In addition to this, that nothing may be wanting to its exact\r\nresemblance to a grotto, there is a circle of seats within, formed of\r\nstone, intermingled with pumice overgrown with moss. This tree was\r\nlooked upon as so worthy of remark, that Licinius Mucianus, who was\r\nthree times consul, and recently the legatus of that province, thought\r\nit a circumstance deserving of transmission even to posterity, that\r\nhe, together with eighteen persons of his retinue, had sat down to a\r\nbanquet in the interior of it. Its leaves afforded material for their\r\ncouches in the greatest abundance, while he himself, sheltered from\r\nevery gust of wind, and trying in vain to hear the pattering of the\r\nrain on the leaves, took his meal there, and enjoyed himself more than\r\nhe would have done amid the resplendence of marble, a multiplicity of\r\npaintings, and beneath a cieling refulgent with gold.\r\n\r\nAnother curious instance, again, was that afforded in the reign of the\r\nEmperor Caius.[432] That prince was so struck with admiration on seeing\r\na plane in the territory of Veliternum, which presented floor after\r\nfloor, like those of the several stories of a house, by means of broad\r\nbenches loosely laid from branch to branch, that he held a banquet\r\nin it—himself adding[433] very materially to the shade it threw—the\r\ntriclinium being formed for the reception of fifteen guests and the\r\nnecessary attendants: to this singular dining-room he gave the name of\r\nhis “nest.”\r\n\r\nAt Gortyna, in the Isle of Crete, there is, in the vicinity of a\r\nfountain there, a single plane-tree, which has been long celebrated\r\nin the records of both the Greek and the Latin language: it never\r\nloses[434] its leaves, and from an early period one of the fabulous\r\nlegends of Greece has been attached to it, to the effect that it was\r\nbeneath this tree that Jupiter lay with Europa; just as if there had\r\nnot been another tree of a similar nature in the island of Cyprus.\r\nSlips of the tree at Gortyna—so fond is man by nature of novelty—were\r\nat an early period planted at different places in Crete, and reproduced\r\nthe natural imperfections of the tree;[435] though, indeed, there is\r\nno higher recommendation in the plane than the fact that in summer\r\nit protects us from the rays of the sun, while in winter it admits\r\nthem. In later times, during the reign of the Emperor Claudius, a\r\nThessalian eunuch, the freedman of Marcellus Æserninus,[436] who,\r\nhowever, from motives of ambition had enrolled himself in the number\r\nof the freedmen of the emperor, and had acquired very considerable\r\nwealth, introduced this plane into Italy, in order to beautify his\r\ncountry-seat: so that he may not inappropriately be styled a second\r\nDionysius. These monstrosities of other lands are still to be seen in\r\nItaly, independently of those which that country has herself devised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (2.)—THE CHAMÆPLATANUS. WHO WAS THE FIRST TO CLIP GREEN SHRUBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor we find in Italy some plane-trees, which are known as\r\nchamæplatani,[437] in consequence of their stunted growth; for we\r\nhave discovered the art of causing abortion in trees even, and hence,\r\neven in the vegetable world we shall have occasion to make mention\r\nof dwarfs, an unprepossessing subject in every case. This result is\r\nobtained in trees, by a peculiar method adopted in planting and lopping\r\nthem. C. Matius,[438] a member of the Equestrian order, and a friend of\r\nthe late Emperor Augustus, invented the art of clipping arbours, within\r\nthe last eighty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (3.)—HOW THE CITRON IS PLANTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cherry and the peach, and all those trees which have either Greek\r\nor foreign names, are exotics: those, however, of this number, which\r\nhave begun to be naturalized among us, will be treated of when I come\r\nto speak of the fruit-trees in general. For the present, I shall\r\nonly make mention of the really exotic trees, beginning with the one\r\nthat is applied to the most salutary uses. The citron tree, called\r\nthe Assyrian, and by some the Median apple, is an antidote against\r\npoisons.[439] The leaf is similar to that of the arbute, except that it\r\nhas small prickles[440] running across it. As to the fruit, it is never\r\neaten,[441] but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell,\r\nwhich is the case, also, with the leaves; indeed, the odour is so\r\nstrong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are once impregnated\r\nwith it, and hence it is very useful in repelling the attacks of\r\nnoxious insects. The tree bears fruit at all seasons of the year; while\r\nsome is falling off, other fruit is ripening, and other, again, just\r\nbursting into birth. Various nations have attempted to naturalize this\r\ntree among them, for the sake of its medical properties, by planting\r\nit in pots of clay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of\r\nintroducing the air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for\r\nall, that it is as well to remember that the best plan is to pack\r\nall slips of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as close\r\ntogether as they can possibly be placed. It has been found, however,\r\nthat this tree will grow nowhere[442] except in Media or Persia. It\r\nis this fruit, the pips of which, as we have already mentioned,[443]\r\nthe Parthian grandees employ in seasoning their ragouts, as being\r\npeculiarly conducive to the sweetening of the breath. We find no other\r\ntree very highly commended that is produced in Media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (4.)—THE TREES OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn describing the country of the Seres, we have already made\r\nmention[444] of the wool-bearing trees which it produces; and we have,\r\nlikewise, touched[445] upon the extraordinary magnitude of the trees of\r\nIndia. Virgil[446] has spoken in glowing terms of the ebony-tree, one\r\nof those which are peculiar to India, and he further informs us, that\r\nit will grow in no other country. Herodotus, however, has preferred to\r\nascribe[447] it to Æthiopia; and states that the people of that country\r\nwere in the habit of paying to the kings of Persia, every third year,\r\nby way of tribute,[448] one hundred billets of ebony-wood, together\r\nwith a certain quantity of gold and ivory. Nor ought we here to omit\r\nthe fact, inasmuch as the same author has stated to that effect, that\r\nthe Æthiopians were also in the habit of paying, by way of tribute,\r\ntwenty large elephants’ teeth. So high was the esteem in which ivory\r\nwas held in the year from the building of our city, 310: for it was\r\nat that period[449] that this author was compiling his History at\r\nThurii, in Italy; which is all the more remarkable, from the implicit\r\nconfidence we place in him, when he says[450] that up to that time, no\r\nnative of Asia or Greece, to his knowledge at least, had ever beheld\r\nthe river Padus. The plan of Æthiopia, which, as we have already\r\nmentioned,[451] was recently laid before the Emperor Nero, informs\r\nus, that this tree is very uncommon in the country that lies between\r\nSyene, the extreme boundary of the empire, and Meroë, a distance of\r\neight hundred and ninety-six miles; and that, in fact, the only kind of\r\ntree that is to be found there, is the palm. It was, probably, for this\r\nreason, that ebony held the third place in the tribute that was thus\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—WHEN EBONY WAS FIRST SEEN AT ROME. THE VARIOUS KINDS OF EBONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPompeius Magnus displayed ebony on the occasion of his triumph over\r\nMithridates. Fabianus declares, that this wood will give out no\r\nflame; it burns, however, with a very agreeable smell. There are two\r\nkinds[452] of ebony; the rarest kind is the best, and is produced\r\nfrom a tree that is singularly free from knots. The wood is black and\r\nshining, and pleasing to the eye, without any adventitious aid from\r\nart. The other kind of ebony is the produce of a shrub which resembles\r\nthe cytisus, and is to be found scattered over the whole of India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (5.)—THE INDIAN THORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is in India, also, a kind of thorn[453] very similar to ebony,\r\nthough it may be distinguished from it, by the aid of a lantern even;\r\nfor, on the application of flame, it will instantly run across the\r\ntree. We will now proceed to describe those trees which were the\r\nadmiration of Alexander the Great in his victorious career, when that\r\npart of the world was first revealed by his arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—THE INDIAN FIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian fig[454] bears but a small fruit. Always growing\r\nspontaneously, it spreads far and wide with its vast branches, the\r\nends of which bend downwards into the ground to such a degree, that\r\nthey take fresh root in the course of a year, and thus form a new\r\nplantation around the parent stock, traced in a circular form, just\r\nas though it had been the work of the ornamental gardener. Within the\r\nbowers thus formed, the shepherds take up their abode in the summer,\r\nthe space occupied by them being, at once, overshadowed and protected\r\nby the bulwark which the tree thus throws around; a most graceful\r\nsight, whether we stand beneath and look upwards, or whether we view\r\nits arcaded foliage from a distance. The higher branches, however,\r\nshoot upwards to a very considerable height, and, by their number,\r\nform quite a grove, springing aloft from the vast trunk of the parent\r\ntree, which overspreads, very frequently, a space of sixty paces in\r\nextent, while the shade that is thrown by it will cover as much as a\r\ncouple of stadia. The broad leaves of the tree have just the shape of\r\nan Amazonian buckler; and hence it is that the fruit, from being quite\r\ncovered by the leaves, is greatly impeded in its growth. The fruit,\r\nindeed, of this tree is but scanty, and never exceeds a bean in size;\r\nbeing ripened, however, by the rays of the sun, as these penetrate the\r\nleaves, the figs are remarkable for their singular lusciousness, and\r\nare quite worthy of the marvellous tree by which they are produced.\r\nThese fig-trees are found, more particularly, in the vicinity of the\r\nriver Acesines.[455]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (6.)—THE PALA: THE FRUIT CALLED ARIENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another tree[456] in India, of still larger size, and even\r\nmore remarkable for the size and sweetness of its fruit, upon which the\r\nsages[457] of India live. The leaf of this tree resembles, in shape,\r\nthe wing of a bird, being three cubits in length, and two in breadth.\r\nIt puts forth its fruit from the bark, a fruit remarkable for the\r\nsweetness of its juice, a single one containing sufficient to satisfy\r\nfour persons. The name of this tree is “pala,” and of the fruit,\r\n“ariena.” They are found in the greatest abundance in the country of\r\nthe Sydraci,[458] a territory which forms the extreme limit of the\r\nexpedition of Alexander.\r\n\r\nThere is another[459] tree, also, very similar to this, but bearing\r\na still sweeter fruit, though very apt to cause derangement of the\r\nbowels. Alexander issued strict orders, forbidding anyone in the\r\nexpedition to touch this fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—INDIAN TREES, THE NAMES OF WHICH ARE UNKNOWN. INDIAN TREES\r\nWHICH BEAR FLAX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Macedonians[460] have made mention of various other kinds of\r\ntrees, the greater part of which, however, are without names. There\r\nis one which resembles the terebinth[461] in every respect, except\r\nthe fruit, which is very similar to the almond, though less in size,\r\nand remarkable for its extreme sweetness. This tree was met with in\r\nBactria, and some persons looked upon it as a variety of the terebinth,\r\nrather than as bearing a strong resemblance to it. As to the tree from\r\nwhich they manufacture a kind of linen[462] cloth, in leaf it resembles\r\nthe mulberry-tree, while the calix of the fruit is similar to the\r\ndog-rose.[463] This tree is reared in the plains, and there is no sight\r\nthroughout the cultivated parts of the country that is more enchanting\r\nthan the plantations of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (7.)—THE PEPPER-TREE.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF\r\nPEPPER—BREGMA—ZINGIBERI, OR ZIMPIBERI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe olive-tree[464] of India is unproductive, with the sole exception\r\nof the wild olive. In every part we meet with trees that bear\r\npepper,[465] very similar in appearance to our junipers, although,\r\nindeed, it has been alleged by some authors that they only grow on the\r\nslopes of Caucasus which lie exposed to the sun. The seeds, however,\r\ndiffer from those of the juniper, in being enclosed in small pods\r\nsimilar to those which we see in the kidney-bean. These pods are picked\r\nbefore they open, and when dried in the sun, make what we call “long\r\npepper.” But if allowed to ripen, they will open gradually, and when\r\narrived at maturity, discover the white pepper; if left exposed to\r\nthe heat of the sun, this becomes wrinkled, and changes its colour.\r\nEven these productions, however, are subject to their own peculiar\r\ninfirmities, and are apt to become blasted by the inclemency of the\r\nweather; in which case the seeds are found to be rotten, and mere\r\nhusks. These abortive seeds are known by the name of “bregma,” a word\r\nwhich in the Indian language signifies “dead.” Of all the various kinds\r\nof pepper, this is the most pungent, as well as the very lightest,\r\nand is remarkable for the extreme paleness of its colour. That which\r\nis black is of a more agreeable flavour; but the white pepper is of a\r\nmilder quality than either.\r\n\r\nThe root of this tree is not, as many persons have imagined, the same\r\nas the substance known as zimpiberi, or, as some call it, zingiberi,\r\nor ginger, although it is very like it in taste. For ginger, in fact,\r\ngrows in Arabia and in Troglodytica, in various cultivated spots, being\r\na small plant[466] with a white root. This plant is apt to decay very\r\nspeedily, although it is of intense pungency; the price at which it\r\nsells is six denarii per pound. Long pepper is very easily adulterated\r\nwith Alexandrian mustard; its price is fifteen denarii per pound,\r\nwhile that of white pepper is seven, and of black, four. It is quite\r\nsurprising that the use of pepper has come so much into fashion, seeing\r\nthat in other substances which we use, it is sometimes their sweetness,\r\nand sometimes their appearance that has attracted our notice; whereas,\r\npepper has nothing in it that can plead as a recommendation to either\r\nfruit or berry, its only desirable quality being a certain pungency;\r\nand yet it is for this that we import it all the way from India! Who\r\nwas the first to make trial of it as an article of food? and who, I\r\nwonder, was the man that was not content to prepare himself by hunger\r\nonly for the satisfying of a greedy appetite? Both pepper and ginger\r\ngrow wild in their respective countries, and yet here we buy them\r\nby weight—just as if they were so much gold or silver. Italy,[467]\r\ntoo, now possesses a species of pepper-tree, somewhat larger than the\r\nmyrtle, and not very unlike it. The bitterness of the grains is similar\r\nto that which we may reasonably suppose to exist in the Indian pepper\r\nwhen newly gathered; but it is wanting in that mature flavour which\r\nthe Indian grain acquires by exposure in the sun, and, consequently,\r\nbears no resemblance to it, either in colour or the wrinkled appearance\r\nof the seeds. Pepper is adulterated with juniper berries, which have\r\nthe property, to a marvellous degree, of assuming the pungency of\r\npepper. In reference to its weight, there are also several methods of\r\nadulterating it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—CARYOPHYLLON, LYCION, AND THE CHIRONIAN PYXACANTHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, also, in India another grain which bears a considerable\r\nresemblance to pepper, but is longer and more brittle; it is known by\r\nthe name of caryophyllon.[468] It is said that this grain is produced\r\nin a sacred grove in India; with us it is imported for its aromatic\r\nperfume. The same country produces, also, a thorny shrub, with\r\ngrains which bear a resemblance to pepper, and are of a remarkably\r\nbitter taste. The leaves of this shrub are small, like those of the\r\ncyprus;[469] the branches are three cubits in length, the bark pallid,\r\nand the roots wide-spreading and woody, and of a colour resembling that\r\nof boxwood. By boiling this root with the seed in a copper vessel, the\r\nmedicament is prepared which is known by the name of lycion.[470] This\r\nthorny shrub grows, also, on Mount Pelion;[471] this last kind is much\r\nused for the purpose of adulterating the medicament above mentioned.\r\nThe root of the asphodel, ox-gall, wormwood, sumach, and the amurca of\r\nolive oil, are also employed for a similar purpose. The best lycion\r\nfor medicinal purposes, is that which has a froth on its surface; the\r\nIndians send it to us in leather bottles, made of the skin of the camel\r\nor the rhinoceros. The shrub itself is known by some persons in Greece\r\nunder the name of the Chironian pyxacanthus.[472]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (8.)—MACIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacir,[473] too, is a vegetable substance that is brought from India,\r\nbeing a red bark that grows upon a large root, and bears the name of\r\nthe tree that produces it; what the nature of this tree is, I have not\r\nbeen able to ascertain. A decoction of this bark, mixed with honey, is\r\ngreatly employed in medicine, as a specific for dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—SUGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nArabia, too, produces sugar;[474] but that of India is the most\r\nesteemed. This substance is a kind of honey, which collects in reeds,\r\nwhite, like gum, and brittle to the teeth. The larger pieces are about\r\nthe size of a filbert; it is only employed, however, in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—TREES OF ARIANA, GEDROSIA, AND HYRCANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the frontiers of India is a country called Ariana, which produces\r\na thorny shrub,[475] rendered precious by the tears which it distils.\r\nIt bears some resemblance to myrrh, but is very difficult of access,\r\nby reason of the thorns with which it is armed. Here, too, a poisonous\r\nshrub is found, with a root like the radish,[476] and leaves like those\r\nof the laurel. By its powerful odour it attracts horses, and was very\r\nnearly depriving Alexander of all his cavalry upon his first arrival\r\nthere, an accident which also happened in Gedrosia. A thorny shrub[477]\r\nhas been also spoken of as a native of the same country, with leaves\r\nlike those of the laurel, the juice of which, if sprinkled upon the\r\neyes, is productive of blindness in all animals. Another plant is\r\nalso mentioned, with a most remarkable odour, and full of diminutive\r\nserpents,[478] the sting of which is sure to cause instant death.\r\nOnesicritus states, that in the vallies of Hyrcania, there is a tree\r\nresembling the fig, and known as the occhus,[479] from which a honey\r\ndistils for two hours every morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (9.)—TREES OF BACTRIANA, BDELLIUM, OR BROCHON, OTHERWISE\r\nMALACHA, OR MALDACON, SCORDASTUM. ADULTERATIONS USED IN ALL SPICES AND\r\nAROMATICS; THE VARIOUS TESTS OF THEM AND THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity, too, of India, is Bactriana, in which region we find\r\nbdellium,[480] that is so highly esteemed. This tree is of a black\r\ncolour, and about the size of the olive; it has leaves like those of\r\nthe robur, and bears a fruit similar to that of the wild fig, and\r\nin nature resembling a kind of gum. This fruit is by some persons\r\ncalled brochon, by others malacha, and by others, again, maldacon.\r\nWhen of a black colour, and rolled up in cakes, it bears the name of\r\nhadrobolon. This substance ought to be transparent and the colour of\r\nwax, odoriferous, unctuous when subjected to friction, and bitter\r\nto the taste, though without the slightest acidity. When used for\r\nsacred purposes, it is steeped in wine, upon which it emits a still\r\nmore powerful odour. The tree is a native of both India and Arabia,\r\nas well as Media and Babylon; some persons give to the bdellium that\r\nis imported by way of Media, the name of peraticum.[481] This last is\r\nremarkable for its brittleness, while, at the same time, it is harder\r\nand more bitter than the other kinds; that of India, on the other\r\nhand, is moister, and gummy. This last sort is adulterated by means\r\nof almonds, while the various other kinds are falsified with the bark\r\nof scordastum, that being the name of a tree[482] the gum of which\r\nstrongly resembles bdellium. These adulterations, however, are to be\r\ndetected—and let it suffice to mention it here, in relation to all\r\nother perfumes as well—by the smell, the colour, the weight, the taste,\r\nand the action of fire. The bdellium of Bactriana is shining and dry,\r\nand covered with numerous white spots resembling the finger-nails;\r\nbesides which, it should be of a certain weight, heavier or lighter\r\nthan which it ought not to be. The price of bdellium, in its pure\r\nstate, is three denarii per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—TREES OF PERSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjoining the countries which we have previously mentioned is Persis,\r\nlying along the shores of the Red Sea, which, when describing[483] it,\r\nwe have mentioned as the Persian Sea, the tides of which penetrate far\r\ninto the land. The trees in these regions are of a marvellous nature;\r\nfor, corroded by the action of the salt, and bearing a considerable\r\nresemblance to vegetable substances that have been thrown up and\r\nabandoned by the tide, they are seen to embrace the arid sands of\r\nthe sea-shore with their naked roots, just like so many polypi. When\r\nthe tide rises, buffeted by the waves, there they stand, fixed and\r\nimmoveable; nay, more, at high water they are completely covered; a\r\nfact which proves to conviction, that they derive their nutriment from\r\nthe salt contained in the water. The size of these trees is quite\r\nmarvellous; in appearance they strongly resemble the arbute; the fruit,\r\nwhich on the outside is very similar to the almond, has a spiral kernel\r\nwithin.[484]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (10.)—TREES OF THE ISLANDS OF THE PERSIAN SEA. THE COTTON\r\nTREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same gulf, there is the island of Tylos,[485] covered with a\r\nforest[486] on the side which looks towards the East, where it is\r\nwashed also by the sea at high tides. Each of the trees is in size as\r\nlarge as the fig; the blossoms are of an indescribable sweetness, and\r\nthe fruit is similar in shape to a lupine, but so rough and prickly,\r\nthat it is never touched by any animal. On a more elevated plateau\r\nof the same island, we find trees that bear wool, but of a different\r\nnature from those of the Seres;[487] as in these trees the leaves\r\nproduce nothing at all, and, indeed, might very readily be taken for\r\nthose of the vine, were it not that they are of smaller size. They\r\nbear a kind of gourd, about the size of a quince;[488] which, when\r\narrived at maturity, bursts asunder and discloses a ball of down, from\r\nwhich a costly kind of linen cloth is made.\r\n\r\n(11.) This tree is known by the name of gossypinus:[489] the smaller\r\nisland of Tylos, which is ten miles distant from the larger one,\r\nproduces it in even greater abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22.—THE TREE CALLED CYNA. TREES FROM WHICH FABRICS FOR CLOTHING\r\nARE MADE IN THE EAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuba states, that about a certain shrub there grows a woolly down, from\r\nwhich a fabric is manufactured, preferable even to those of India. He\r\nadds, too, that certain trees of Arabia, from which vestments are made,\r\nare called cynæ, and that they have a leaf similar to that of the palm.\r\nThus do their very trees afford clothing for the people of India. In\r\nthe islands of Tylos, there is also another tree, with a blossom like\r\nthe white violet[490] in appearance, though four times as large, but it\r\nis destitute of smell, a very remarkable fact in these climates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—A COUNTRY WHERE THE TREES NEVER LOSE THEIR LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also another tree similar to the preceding one, but with a\r\nthicker foliage, and a blossom like the rose. This flower shuts[491] at\r\nnight, and, beginning to open towards sun-rise, appears in full blow\r\nby mid-day; the natives are in the habit of saying that in this way\r\nit goes to sleep. The same island bears also the palm, the olive, the\r\nvine, and the fig, with various other kinds of fruit. None of the trees\r\nin this island lose their leaves;[492] it is abundantly watered by cool\r\nstreams, and receives the benefit of rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—THE VARIOUS USEFUL PRODUCTS OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nArabia, which is in the vicinity of these islands, requires that we\r\nshould make some distinction in its vegetable products, seeing that\r\nhere the various parts of trees which are employed for useful purposes\r\nare the root, the branches, the bark, the juices, the gum, the wood,\r\nthe shoots, the blossoms, the leaves, and the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25. (12.)—COSTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA root and a leaf, however, are the productions which are held in the\r\nvery highest estimation in India. The root is that of the costus;[493]\r\nit has a burning taste in the mouth, and a most exquisite odour; in\r\nother respects, the branches are good for nothing. In the island of\r\nPatale,[494] situate at the very mouth of the river Indus, there\r\nare two kinds of costus found, the black and the white; the last is\r\nconsidered the best. The price of it is five denarii per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—NARD. THE TWELVE VARIETIES OF THE PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the leaf, which is that of the nard,[495] it is only right to\r\nspeak somewhat more at length, as it holds the principal place among\r\nour unguents. The nard is a shrub with a heavy, thick root, but\r\nshort, black, brittle, and yet unctuous as well; it has a musty\r\nsmell, too, very much like that of the cyperus, with a sharp, acrid\r\ntaste, the leaves being small, and growing in tufts. The heads of the\r\nnard spread out into ears; hence it is that nard is so famous for\r\nits two-fold production, the spike or ear, and the leaf. There is\r\nanother kind, again, that grows on the banks of the Ganges, but is\r\naltogether condemned, as being good for nothing; it bears the name of\r\nozænitis,[496] and emits a fetid odour. Nard is adulterated with a sort\r\nof plant called pseudo-nard,[497] which is found growing everywhere,\r\nand is known by its thick, broad leaf, and its sickly colour, which\r\ninclines to white. It is sophisticated, also, by being mixed with the\r\nroot of the genuine nard, which adds very considerably to its weight.\r\nGum is also used for the same purpose, antimony, and cyperus; or, at\r\nleast, the outer coat of the cyperus. Its genuineness is tested by its\r\nlightness, the redness of its colour, its sweet smell, and the taste\r\nmore particularly, which parches the mouth, and leaves a pleasant\r\nflavour behind it; the price of spikenard is one hundred denarii per\r\npound.\r\n\r\nLeaf[498] nard varies in price according to the size; for that which\r\nis known by the name of hadrosphærum, consisting of the larger leaves,\r\nsells at forty denarii per pound; when the leaves are smaller, it is\r\ncalled mesosphærum, and is sold at sixty. But that which is considered\r\nthe most valuable of all, is known as microsphærum, and consists of\r\nthe very smallest of the leaves; it sells at seventy-five denarii per\r\npound. All these varieties of nard have an agreeable odour, but it is\r\nmost powerful when fresh. If the nard is old when gathered, that which\r\nis of a black colour is considered the best.\r\n\r\nIn our part of the world, the Syrian[499] nard is held in the next\r\nhighest esteem next to this; then the Gallic;[500] and in the\r\nthird place, that of Crete,[501] which by some persons is called\r\n“agrion,” and by others “phu.” This last has exactly the leaf of the\r\nolusatrum,[502] with a stalk a cubit in length, knotted, of a whitish\r\ncolour, inclining to purple, and a root that runs sideways; it is\r\ncovered, too, with long hair, and strongly resembles the foot of a\r\nbird. Field nard is known by the name of baccar.[503] We shall have\r\nfurther occasion to mention it when we come to speak of the flowers.\r\nAll these kinds of nard, however, are to be reckoned as herbs, with\r\nthe exception of Indian nard. Of these, the Gallic kind is pulled up\r\nalong with the root, and washed in wine; after which it is dried in\r\nthe shade, and wrapped up in paper, in small parcels. It is not very\r\ndifferent from the Indian nard, but is lighter than that of Syria;\r\nthe price at which it sells is three denarii per pound. The only way\r\nof testing the leaves of all these varieties of nard, is to see that\r\nthey are not brittle and parched, instead of being dried naturally\r\nand gradually. Together with the nard that grows in Gaul, there\r\nalways[504] springs up a herb, which is known by the name of hirculus,\r\nor the “little goat,” on account of its offensive smell, it being very\r\nsimilar to that of the goat. This herb, too, is very much used in the\r\nadulteration of nard, though it differs from it in the fact that it has\r\nno stem, and its leaves are smaller; the root, too, is not bitter, and\r\nis entirely destitute of smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27. (13.)—ASARUM, OR FOAL-FOOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe herb asarum,[505] too, has the properties of nard, and, indeed,\r\nby some persons is known as wild nard. It has a leaf, however, more\r\nlike that of the ivy, only that it is rounder and softer. The flower is\r\npurple, the root very similar to that of the Gallic nard, and the seed\r\nis like a grape. It is of a warm and vinous flavour, and blossoms twice\r\na year, growing upon hill sides that are densely shaded. The best kind\r\nis that found in Pontus, and the next best that of Phrygia; that of\r\nIllyricum being only of third-rate quality. The root is dug up when it\r\nis just beginning to put forth its leaves, and then dried in the sun.\r\nIt very soon turns mouldy, and loses its properties. There has, also,\r\nbeen lately found a certain herb in some parts of Greece, the leaves of\r\nwhich do not differ in the slightest degree from those of the Indian\r\nnard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—AMOMUM.—AMOMIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clustered amomum[506] is very extensively used; it grows upon a\r\nkind of wild vine that is found in India, though some persons have\r\nbeen of opinion that it is borne by a shrub, resembling the myrtle in\r\nappearance, and about the same height as the palm. This plant, also,\r\nis plucked along with the root, and is carefully pressed together with\r\nthe hands; for it very soon becomes brittle. That kind is held in the\r\nhighest esteem, the leaves of which bear a strong resemblance to those\r\nof the pomegranate, being free from wrinkles, and of a red colour.\r\nThe second quality is that which is of a pallid hue. That which has a\r\ngreen, grassy appearance, is not so good, and the white is the worst of\r\nall; it assumes this appearance when old. The price of clustered amomum\r\nis sixty denarii per pound, but in dust it sells at only forty-nine.\r\nAmomum is produced, also, in that part of Armenia which is known as\r\nOtene; as, also, in Media and Pontus. It is adulterated with the leaves\r\nof the pomegranate and a solution of gum, which is employed in order\r\nto make the leaves adhere and form clusters, like those of the grape.\r\n\r\nThere is another substance, also, which is known by the name of\r\namomis;[507] it is not so full of veins as amomum, harder, and not so\r\nodoriferous; from which it would appear, either that it is altogether a\r\ndifferent plant, or else that it is amomum gathered in an unripe state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—CARDAMOMUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar to these substances, both in name as well as the shrub which\r\nproduces it, is the cardamomum,[508] the seeds of which are of an\r\noblong shape. It is gathered in the same manner both in India and\r\nArabia. There are four different kinds of cardamomum. That which is of\r\na very green colour, unctuous, with sharp angles, and very difficult\r\nto break, is the most highly esteemed of all. The next best is of a\r\nreddish white tint, while that of third-rate quality is shorter and\r\nblacker, the worst of all being mottled and friable, and emitting but\r\nlittle smell; which, in its genuine[509] state ought to be very similar\r\nto costum. Cardamomum grows also in Media. The price of the best is\r\nthree denarii per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—THE COUNTRY OF FRANKINCENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in affinity to cardamomum would have been cinnamomum,[510] and\r\nthis we should have now proceeded to speak of, were it not more\r\nconvenient first to make mention of the treasures of Arabia, and the\r\nreasons for which that country has received the names of “Happy” and\r\n“Blest.” The chief productions of Arabia are frankincense and myrrh,\r\nwhich last it bears in common with the country of the Troglodytæ.\r\n(14.) There is no country in the world that produces frankincense\r\nexcept Arabia,[511] and, indeed, not the whole of that. Almost in the\r\nvery centre of that region, are the Atramitæ,[512] a community of the\r\nSabæi, the capital of whose kingdom is Sabota, a place situate on\r\na lofty mountain. At a distance of eight stations from this is the\r\nincense-bearing region, known by the name of Saba. The Greeks say that\r\nthe word signifies a “secret mystery.” This district looks towards\r\nthe north-east, and is rendered inaccessible by rocks on every side,\r\nwhile it is bounded on the right by the sea, from which it is shut\r\nout by cliffs of tremendous height. The soil of this territory is\r\nsaid to be of a milky white, a little inclining to red. The forests\r\nextend twenty schœni in length, and half that distance in breadth. The\r\nlength of the schœnus, according to the estimate of Eratosthenes, is\r\nforty stadia, or, in other words, five miles; some persons, however,\r\nhave estimated the schœnus at no more than thirty-two stadia. In this\r\ndistrict some lofty hills take their rise, and the trees, which spring\r\nup spontaneously, run downwards along the declivities to the plains. It\r\nis generally agreed that the soil is argillaceous, and that the springs\r\nwhich there take their rise are but few in number, and of a nitrous\r\nquality. Adjoining are the Minæi, the people of another community,\r\nthrough whose country is the sole transit for the frankincense, along a\r\nsingle narrow road. The Minæi were the first people who carried on any\r\ntraffic in frankincense, which they still do to a greater extent than\r\nany other persons, and hence it is that it has received the appellation\r\nof “Minæan.” It is the Sabæi alone, and no other people among the\r\nArabians, that behold the incense-tree; and, indeed, not all of them,\r\nfor it is said that there are not more than three thousand families\r\nwhich have a right to claim that privilege, by virtue of hereditary\r\nsuccession; and that for this reason those persons are called sacred,\r\nand are not allowed, while pruning the trees or gathering the harvest,\r\nto receive any pollution, either by intercourse with women, or coming\r\nin contact with the dead; by these religious observances it is that\r\nthe price of the commodity is so considerably enhanced. Some persons,\r\nhowever, say, that the right of gathering incense in the forests\r\nbelongs to all these people in common, while others again state, that\r\nthey take their turns year by year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—THE TREES THAT BEAR FRANKINCENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor is it by any means agreed what is the appearance of the\r\nincense-tree. We have sent several expeditions against Arabia, and\r\nthe Roman arms have penetrated into the greater part of that country;\r\nindeed, Caius Cæsar,[513] the son of Augustus, even earned considerable\r\nrenown there; and yet this tree has been described by no Latin writer,\r\nat least that I know of. The descriptions given of it by the Greek\r\nwriters vary very considerably: some of them say that it has exactly\r\nthe leaf of the pear-tree, only somewhat smaller, and of a grass-green\r\ncolour. Others, again, say, that it has a rather reddish leaf, like\r\nthat of the mastich, and others, that it is a kind of terebinth,[514]\r\nand that King Antigonus, to whom a branch of it was brought, was of\r\nthat opinion. King Juba, in the work which he wrote and dedicated to\r\nCaius Cæsar, the son of Augustus, who was inflamed by the wide-spread\r\nrenown of Arabia, states, that the tree has a spiral stem, and that\r\nthe branches bear a considerable resemblance to those of the Pontic\r\nmaple, while it secretes a sort of juice very similar to that of the\r\nalmond-tree. Such, he says, is the appearance of the tree as seen in\r\nCarmania and Egypt, where it was introduced and planted under the\r\nauspices of the Ptolemies when reigning there. It is well known that\r\nit has a bark not unlike that of the laurel, and, indeed, some persons\r\nhave asserted that their leaves are similar. At all events, such was\r\nthe case with the tree as it grew at Sardes: for the kings of Asia also\r\ntook considerable care to have it planted there. The ambassadors who\r\nin my time have come to Rome from Arabia, have made all these matters\r\nmore uncertain, even, than they were before; a thing at which we may\r\njustly be surprised, seeing that some sprigs even of the incense-tree\r\nhave been brought among us, from which we have some reason to conclude\r\nthat the parent tree is round and tapering, and that it puts forth its\r\nshoots from a trunk that is entirely free from knots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—VARIOUS KINDS OF FRANKINCENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former times, when they had fewer opportunities of selling it, they\r\nused to gather the frankincense only once a year; but at the present\r\nday, as there is a much greater demand for it, there is a second crop\r\nas well. The first, and what we may call the natural, vintage, takes\r\nplace about the rising of the Dog-star, a period when the heat is most\r\nintense; on which occasion they cut the tree where the bark appears\r\nto be the fullest of juice, and extremely thin, from being distended\r\nto the greatest extent. The incision thus made is gradually extended,\r\nbut nothing is removed; the consequence of which is, that an unctuous\r\nfoam oozes forth, which gradually coagulates and thickens. When the\r\nnature of the locality requires it, this juice is received upon mats\r\nof palm-leaves, though in some places the space around the tree is\r\nmade hard by being well rammed down for the purpose. The frankincense\r\nthat is gathered after the former method, is in the purest state,\r\nthough that which falls on the ground is the heaviest in weight: that\r\nwhich adheres to the tree is pared off with an iron instrument, which\r\naccounts for its being found mingled with pieces of bark.\r\n\r\nThe forest is allotted in certain portions, and such is the mutual\r\nprobity of the owners, that it is quite safe from all depredation;\r\nindeed, there is no one left to watch the trees after the incisions\r\nare made, and yet no one is ever known to plunder his neighbour. But,\r\nby Hercules! at Alexandria, where the incense is dressed for sale, the\r\nworkshops can never be guarded with sufficient care; a seal is even\r\nplaced upon the workmen’s aprons, and a mask put upon the head, or\r\nelse a net with very close meshes, while the people are stripped naked\r\nbefore they are allowed to leave work. So true it is that punishments\r\nafford less security among us than is to be found by these Arabians\r\namid their woods and forests! The incense which has accumulated during\r\nthe summer is gathered in the autumn: it is the purest of all, and\r\nis of a white colour. The second gathering takes place in spring,\r\nincisions being made in the bark for that purpose during the winter:\r\nthis, however, is of a red colour, and not to be compared with the\r\nother incense. The first, or superior kind of incense, is known as\r\ncarfiathum,[515] the latter is called dathiathum. It is thought, also,\r\nthat the incense which is gathered from the tree while young is the\r\nwhitest, though the produce of the old trees has the most powerful\r\nsmell; some persons, too, have an impression that the best incense is\r\nfound in the islands, but Juba asserts that no incense at all is grown\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThat incense which has hung suspended in globular drops is known to us\r\nas “male” frankincense, although it is mostly the case that we do not\r\nuse the term “male” except in contradistinction to the word “female:”\r\nit has been attributed, however, to religious scruples, that the name\r\nof the other sex was not employed as a denomination for this substance.\r\nSome persons, again, are of opinion that the male frankincense has been\r\nso called from its resemblance[516] to the testes of the male. The\r\nincense, however, that is the most esteemed of all is that which is\r\nmammose, or breast-shaped, and is produced when one drop has stopped\r\nshort, and another, following close upon it, has adhered, and united\r\nwith it. I find it stated that one of these lumps used to make quite a\r\nhandful, at a time when men displayed less eagerness to gather it, and\r\nit was allowed more time to accumulate. The Greeks call such lumps as\r\nthese by the name of stagonia[517] and atomus,[518] while the smaller\r\npieces are called orobia.[519] The fragments which are broken off by\r\nshaking the tree are known to us as manna.[520] Even at the present\r\nday, however, there are drops found which weigh one-third of a mina,\r\nor, in other words, twenty-eight denarii. Alexander the Great, when\r\na boy, was on one occasion loading the altars with frankincense with\r\nthe greatest prodigality, upon which his tutor Leonides[521] remarked\r\nto him that it would be time to worship the gods in such a lavish\r\nmanner as that, when he had conquered the countries that produced the\r\nfrankincense. After Alexander had conquered Arabia, he despatched\r\nto Leonides a ship freighted with frankincense, and sent him word,\r\nrequesting that he would now worship the gods without stint or limit.\r\n\r\nThe incense, after being collected, is carried on camels’ backs\r\nto Sabota,[522] at which place a single gate is left open for its\r\nadmission. To deviate from the high road while conveying it, the laws\r\nhave made a capital offence. At this place the priests take by measure,\r\nand not by weight, a tenth part in honour of their god, whom they call\r\nSabis;[523] indeed, it is not allowable to dispose of it before this\r\nhas been done: out of this tenth the public expenses are defrayed,\r\nfor the divinity generously entertains all those strangers who have\r\nmade a certain number of days’ journey in coming thither. The incense\r\ncan only be exported through the country of the Gebanitæ, and for\r\nthis reason it is that a certain tax is paid to their king as well.\r\nThomna,[524] which is their capital, is distant from Gaza, a city of\r\nJudæa, on the shores of our sea, 4436[525] miles, the distance being\r\ndivided into sixty-five days’ journey by camel. There are certain\r\nportions also of the frankincense which are given to the priests and\r\nthe king’s secretaries: and in addition to these, the keepers of it,\r\nas well as the soldiers who guard it, the gate-keepers, and various\r\nother employes, have their share as well. And then besides, all along\r\nthe route, there is at one place water to pay for, at another fodder,\r\nlodging at the stations, and various taxes and imposts besides; the\r\nconsequence of which is, that the expense for each camel before it\r\narrives at the shores of our[526] sea is six hundred and eighty-eight\r\ndenarii; after all this, too, there are certain payments still to be\r\nmade to the farmers of the revenue of our empire. Hence it is that a\r\npound of the best frankincense sells at six denarii, the second quality\r\nfive, and the third three. Among us, it is adulterated with drops of\r\nwhite resin, a substance which bears a strong resemblance to it: but\r\nthe fraud may be easily detected by the methods which have been already\r\nmentioned.[527] It is tested by the following qualities; its whiteness,\r\nsize, brittleness, and the readiness with which it takes fire when\r\nplaced on heated coals; in addition to which, it should not give to the\r\npressure of the teeth, but from its natural brittleness crumble all to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33. (15.)—MYRRH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to some authors, myrrh[528] is the produce of a tree that\r\ngrows in the same forests as the incense-tree, though most say that\r\nthey grow in different places: but the fact is that myrrh grows in many\r\nparts of Arabia, as will be seen when we come to speak of the several\r\nvarieties of it. A sort that is highly esteemed is brought from the\r\nislands[529] also, and the Sabæi even cross the sea to procure it in\r\nthe country of the Troglodytæ. It is grown also by being transplanted,\r\nand when thus cultivated is greatly preferred to that which is grown in\r\nthe forests. The plant is greatly improved by raking and baring the\r\nroots; indeed, the cooler the roots are kept, the better it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—THE TREES WHICH PRODUCE MYRRH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tree grows to the height of five cubits, and has thorns upon\r\nit: the trunk is hard and spiral, and thicker than that of the\r\nincense-tree, and much more so at the root than at the upper part of\r\nthe tree. Some authors have said that the bark is smooth like that of\r\nthe arbute, others, that it is rough and covered with thorns: it has\r\nthe leaf of the olive, but more wavy, with sharp points at the edges:\r\nJuba says, however, that it resembles the leaf of the olusatrum. Some\r\nagain say that it resembles the juniper,[530] only that it is rougher\r\nand bristling with thorns, and that the leaves are of a rounder shape,\r\nthough they have exactly the taste of the juniper. There have been some\r\nwriters who have incorrectly asserted that both myrrh and frankincense\r\nare the product of the same tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—THE NATURE AND VARIOUS KINDS OF MYRRH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncisions are made in the myrrh-tree also twice a year, and at the same\r\nseason as in the incense-tree; but in the case of the myrrh-tree they\r\nare all made the way up from the root as far as the branches which are\r\nable to bear it. The tree spontaneously exudes, before the incision\r\nis made, a liquid which bears the name of stacte,[531] and to which\r\nthere is no myrrh that is superior. Second only in quality to this is\r\nthe cultivated myrrh: of the wild or forest kind, the best is that\r\nwhich is gathered in summer. They give no tithes of myrrh to the god,\r\nbecause it is the produce of other countries as well; but the growers\r\npay the fourth part of it to the king of the Gebanitæ. Myrrh is bought\r\nup indiscriminately by the common people, and then packed into bags;\r\nbut our perfumers separate it without any difficulty, the principal\r\ntests of its goodness being its unctuousness and its aromatic smell.\r\n(16.) There are several[532] kinds of myrrh; the first among the wild\r\nmyrrhs is the Troglodytic; and the next are the Minæan, which includes\r\nthe Atramitic, and that of Ausaritis, in the kingdom of the Gebanitæ.\r\nA third kind is the Dianitic,[533] and a fourth is the mixed myrrh,\r\nor “all-sorts;”[534] a fifth, again, is the Sambracenian, which is\r\nbrought from a city in the kingdom of the Sabæi, near the sea; and a\r\nsixth is known by the name of Dusaritic. There is a white myrrh also,\r\nwhich is produced in only one spot, and is carried for sale to the city\r\nof Messalum. The Troglodytic myrrh is tested by its unctuousness, and\r\nits peculiarly dry appearance: it has also a dirty, rough look with\r\nit, but is more acrid than the other kinds. The Sambracenian myrrh has\r\nnone of these faults, and is more sightly in appearance than any of\r\nthem, though it is far from being so powerful. In general, however, the\r\nproof of its goodness consists in its being separated in little pieces\r\nof uneven shape, formed by the concretion of a whitish juice, which\r\ndries up little by little. When broken it ought to exhibit white marks\r\nlike the finger-nails, and to be slightly bitter to the taste. That\r\nof second quality is of a mottled appearance within; while of worse\r\nquality is that which is of a black colour within; the very worst of\r\nall is that which is black on the outside as well.\r\n\r\nThe price of myrrh varies according to the number of purchasers.\r\nStacte is sold at prices which vary from three denarii to forty per\r\npound, while the very highest price of the cultivated myrrh is eleven\r\ndenarii. Erythræan myrrh, the same, it is pretended, as Arabian myrrh,\r\nis sixteen denarii per pound, Troglodytic also, is sixteen denarii;\r\nand that known as odoraria, or odoriferous myrrh, sells at fourteen.\r\nMyrrh is adulterated with pieces of mastich, and other gums; it is also\r\ndrugged with the juice of wild cucumber, in order to produce a certain\r\nbitterness, and with litharge for the purpose of increasing its weight.\r\nOther sophistications may be discovered on tasting it, and the gum will\r\nadhere to the teeth. But the cleverest mode of adulterating it is with\r\nIndian myrrh,[535] a substance which is gathered from a certain prickly\r\nshrub which grows there. This is the only thing that India produces of\r\nworse quality than the corresponding produce of other countries: they\r\nmay, however, be very easily distinguished, that of India being so very\r\nmuch inferior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36. (17.)—MASTICH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transition, therefore,[536] is very easy to mastich, which grows\r\nupon another prickly shrub of India and Arabia, known by the name of\r\nlaina. Of mastich as well there are two different kinds; for in Asia\r\nand Greece there is also found a herb which puts forth leaves from the\r\nroot, and bears a thistly head, resembling an apple, and full of seeds.\r\nUpon an incision being made in the upper part of this plant drops\r\ndistil from it, which can hardly be distinguished from the genuine\r\nmastich. There is, again, a third sort,[537] found in Pontus, but more\r\nlike bitumen than anything else. The most esteemed, however, of all\r\nthese, is the white mastich of Chios, the price of which is twenty\r\ndenarii per pound, while the black mastich sells at twelve. It is said\r\nthat the mastich of Chios exudes from the lentisk in the form of a sort\r\nof gum: like frankincense, it is adulterated with resin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—LADANUM AND STOBOLON.\r\n\r\n\r\nArabia, too, still boasts of her ladanum.[538] Many writers have\r\nstated that this substance is the fortuitous result of an accidental\r\ninjury inflicted upon a certain odoriferous plant, under the following\r\ncircumstances: the goat, they say, which is in general an animal that\r\nis extremely mischievous to foliage, is particularly fond of the shrubs\r\nthat are odoriferous, as if, indeed, it were really sensible of the\r\nvalue that is set upon them. Hence it is that as the animal crops the\r\nsprouting shoots of the branches which are swollen with a liquid juice\r\nof remarkable sweetness, these juices drop and become mingled together,\r\nand are then wiped up by the shaggy hairs of its unlucky beard. Being\r\nthere mingled with the dust, these juices form knots and tufts, and\r\nare then dried by the sun; and hence the circumstance is accounted for\r\nthat in the ladanum which is imported by us we find goats’ hairs. This,\r\nhowever, we are told, occurs nowhere but among the Nabatæi,[539] a\r\npeople of Arabia, who border upon Syria. The more recent writers call\r\nthis substance by the name of stobolon, and state that in the forests\r\nof Arabia the trees are broken by the goats while browzing, and that\r\nthe juices in consequence adhere to their shaggy hair; but the genuine\r\nladanum, they assure us, comes from the island of Cyprus. I make\r\nmention of this in order that every kind of odoriferous plant may be\r\ntaken some notice of, even though incidentally and not in the order of\r\ntheir respective localities. They say also that this Cyprian ladanum\r\nis collected in the same manner as the other, and that it forms a kind\r\nof greasy substance or œsypum,[540] which adheres to the beards and\r\nshaggy legs of the goats; but that it is produced from the flowers of\r\nthe ground-ivy, which they have nibbled when in quest of their morning\r\nfood, a time at which the whole island is covered with dew. After this,\r\nthey say, when the fogs are dispersed by the sun, the dust adheres to\r\ntheir wet coats, and the ladanum is formed, which is afterwards taken\r\noff of them with a comb.\r\n\r\nThere are some authors who give to the plant of Cyprus, from which it\r\nis made, the name of leda; and hence it is that we find it also called\r\nledanum. They say, also, that a viscous substance settles upon this\r\nplant, and, that, by the aid of strings wound around it, its leaves\r\nare rolled into balls, from which a kind of cake is made. Hence it is,\r\nthat in Cyprus, as well as in Arabia, there are two kinds of ladanum;\r\nthe one natural, and mingled with earth, and the other artificial: the\r\nformer is friable, while the latter is of a viscous nature.\r\n\r\nIt is stated, also, that this substance is the produce of a shrub\r\noriginally found in Carmania, and propagated by plants, by order of\r\nthe Ptolemies, in the parts beyond Egypt; while other authorities are\r\nfound, which say that it grows on the incense tree, and is gathered\r\nlike gum, from incisions made in the bark, after which it is collected\r\nin bags of goat-skin. That of the most approved quality, sells at the\r\nrate of forty asses per pound. Ladanum is adulterated with myrtle\r\nberries, and filth taken from the fleeces of other animals besides the\r\ngoat. If genuine, it ought to have a wild and acrid smell, in some\r\nmeasure redolent of the desert places where it is produced: it is dry\r\nand parched in appearance, but becomes soft the moment it is touched.\r\nWhen ignited, it gives a brilliant flame, and emits a powerful but\r\npleasant odour; if mixed with myrtle berries, its spurious quality is\r\nimmediately discovered by their crackling in the fire. In addition to\r\nthis, the genuine ladanum has more grits, or stony particles, adhering\r\nto it, than dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—ENHÆMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Arabia, too, the olive-tree distils a sort of tear, with which\r\nthe Indians make a medicament, known by the Greeks as enhæmon;[541]\r\nit is said to be of wonderful efficacy in contracting and healing\r\nwounds and sores. These trees,[542] situate on the coasts there, are\r\ncovered by the sea at high water, without the berries suffering the\r\nslightest injury, although it is a well-known fact, that the salt\r\ncollects upon the leaves. All these trees are peculiar to Arabia,\r\nbut it has some few besides, in common with other countries, of which\r\nwe shall make mention elsewhere, the kinds growing in Arabia being of\r\ninferior quality. The people of that country have a wonderful regard\r\nfor the perfumes of foreign parts, and import them from places at a\r\nconsiderable distance; so soon are men sated with what they have of\r\ntheir own, and so covetous are they of what belongs to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—THE TREE CALLED BRATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHence it is, that they import from the country of the Elymæi[543] the\r\nwood of a tree called bratus,[544] which is similar in appearance to\r\na spreading cypress. Its branches are of a whitish colour, and the\r\nwood, while burning, emits a pleasant odour; it is highly spoken of by\r\nClaudius Cæsar, in his History,[545] for its marvellous properties. He\r\nstates that the Parthians sprinkle the leaves of it in their drink,\r\nthat its smell closely resembles that of the cedar, and that the smoke\r\nof it is efficacious in counteracting the effects of smoke emitted\r\nby other wood. This tree grows in the countries that lie beyond the\r\nPasitigris,[546] in the territory of the city of Sittaca, upon Mount\r\nZagrus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—THE TREE CALLED STOBRUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arabians import from Carmania also the wood of a tree called\r\nstobrum,[547] which they employ in fumigations, by steeping it in\r\npalm wine, and then setting fire to it. The odour first ascends to\r\nthe ceiling, and then descends in volumes to the floor; it is very\r\nagreeable, but is apt to cause an oppression of the head, though\r\nunattended with pain; it is used for promoting sleep in persons when\r\nill. For these branches of commerce, they have opened the city of\r\nCarræ,[548] which serves as an entrepot, and from which place they\r\nwere formerly in the habit of proceeding to Gabba, at a distance of\r\ntwenty days’ journey, and thence to Palæstina, in Syria. But at a\r\nlater period, as Juba informs us, they began to take the road, for\r\nthe purposes of this traffic, to Charax[549] and the kingdom of the\r\nParthians. For my own part, it would appear to me that they were in the\r\nhabit of importing these commodities among the Persians, even before\r\nthey began to convey them to Syria or Egypt; at least Herodotus bears\r\ntestimony to that effect, when he states that the Arabians paid a\r\nyearly tribute of one thousand talents, in frankincense, to the kings\r\nof Persia.\r\n\r\nFrom Syria they bring back storax,[550] which, burnt upon the hearth,\r\nby its powerful smell dispels that loathing of their own perfumes with\r\nwhich these people are affected. For in general there are no kinds of\r\nwood in use among them, except those which are odoriferous; indeed, the\r\nSabæi are in the habit of cooking their food with incense wood, while\r\nothers, again, employ that of the myrrh tree; and hence, the smoke and\r\nsmells that pervade their cities and villages are no other than the\r\nvery same which, with us, proceed from the altars. For the purpose of\r\nqualifying this powerful smell, they burn storax in goat-skins, and\r\nso fumigate their dwellings. So true it is, that there is no pleasure\r\nto be found, but what the continual enjoyment of it begets loathing.\r\nThey also burn this substance to drive away the serpents, which are\r\nextremely numerous in the forests which bear the odoriferous trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41. (18.)—WHY ARABIA WAS CALLED “HAPPY.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArabia produces neither cinnamon nor cassia; and this is the country\r\nstyled “Happy” Arabia! False and ungrateful does she prove herself\r\nin the adoption of this surname, which she would imply to have been\r\nreceived from the gods above; whereas, in reality, she is indebted\r\nfor it far more to the gods below.[551] It is the luxury which is\r\ndisplayed by man, even in the paraphernalia of death, that has rendered\r\nArabia thus “happy;” and which prompts him to burn with the dead what\r\nwas originally understood to have been produced for the service of the\r\ngods. Those who are likely to be the best acquainted with the matter,\r\nassert that this country does not produce, in a whole year, so large a\r\nquantity of perfumes as was burnt by the Emperor Nero at the funeral\r\nobsequies of his wife Poppæa. And then let us only take into account\r\nthe vast number of funerals that are celebrated throughout the whole\r\nworld each year, and the heaps of odours that are piled up in honour\r\nof the bodies of the dead; the vast quantities, too, that are offered\r\nto the gods in single grains; and yet, when men were in the habit of\r\noffering up to them the salted cake, they did not show themselves any\r\nthe less propitious; nay, rather, as the facts themselves prove, they\r\nwere even more favourable to us than they are now. But it is the sea of\r\nArabia that has even a still greater right to be called “happy,” for it\r\nis this that furnishes us with pearls. At the very lowest computation,\r\nIndia, the Seres, and the Arabian Peninsula, withdraw from our empire\r\none hundred millions of sesterces every year—so dearly do we pay for\r\nour luxury and our women. How large a portion, too, I should like to\r\nknow, of all these perfumes, really comes to the gods of heaven, and\r\nthe deities of the shades below?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42. (19.)—CINNAMOMUM.[552] XYLOCINNAMUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nFabulous antiquity, and Herodotus[553] more particularly, have related\r\nthat cinnamomum and cassia are found in the nests of certain birds, and\r\nprincipally that of the phœnix, in the districts where Father Liber was\r\nbrought up; and that these substances either fall from the inaccessible\r\nrocks and trees in which the nests are built, in consequence of the\r\nweight of the pieces of flesh which the birds carry up, or else are\r\nbrought down by the aid of arrows loaded with lead. It is said, also,\r\nthat cassia grows around certain marshes, but is protected by a\r\nfrightful kind of bat armed with claws, and by winged serpents as well.\r\nAll these tales, however, have been evidently invented for the purpose\r\nof enhancing the prices of these commodities. Another story, too, bears\r\nthem company, to the effect that under the rays of the noon-day sun,\r\nthe entire peninsula exhales a certain indescribable perfume composed\r\nof its numerous odours; that the breezes, as they blow from it, are\r\nimpregnated with these odours, and, indeed, were the first to announce\r\nthe vicinity of Arabia to the fleets of Alexander the Great, while\r\nstill far out at sea. All this, however, is false; for cinnamomum,\r\nor cinnamum, which is the same thing, grows in the country of the\r\nÆthiopians,[554] who are united by intermarriages with the Troglodytæ.\r\nThese last, after buying it of their neighbours, carry it over vast\r\ntracts of sea, upon rafts, which are neither steered by rudder, nor\r\ndrawn or impelled by oars or sails. Nor yet are they aided by any of\r\nthe resources of art, man alone, and his daring boldness, standing\r\nin place of all these; in addition to which, they choose the winter\r\nseason, about the time of the equinox, for their voyage, for then a\r\nsouth easterly wind is blowing; these winds guide them in a straight\r\ncourse from gulf to gulf, and after they have doubled the promontory\r\nof Arabia, the north east wind carries them to a port of the Gebanitæ,\r\nknown by the name of Ocilia.[555] Hence it is that they steer for this\r\nport in preference; and they say that it is almost five years before\r\nthe merchants are able to effect their return, while many perish on the\r\nvoyage. In return for their wares, they bring back articles of glass\r\nand copper, cloths, buckles, bracelets, and necklaces; hence it is that\r\nthis traffic depends more particularly upon the capricious tastes and\r\ninclinations of the female sex.\r\n\r\nThe cinnamon shrub[556] is only two cubits in height, at the most, the\r\nlowest being no more than a palm in height. It is about four fingers\r\nin breadth, and hardly has it risen six fingers from the ground,\r\nbefore it begins to put forth shoots and suckers. It has then all the\r\nappearance of being dry and withered, and while it is green it has no\r\nodour at all. The leaf is like that of wild marjoram, and it thrives\r\nbest in dry localities, being not so prolific in rainy weather; it\r\nrequires, also, to be kept constantly clipped. Though it grows on level\r\nground, it thrives best among tangled brakes and brambles, and hence\r\nit is extremely difficult to be gathered. It is never gathered unless\r\nwith the permission of the god, by whom some suppose Jupiter to be\r\nmeant; the Æthiopians, however, call him Assabinus.[557] They offer the\r\nentrails of forty-four oxen, goats, and rams, when they implore his\r\npermission to do so, but after all, they are not allowed to work at it\r\nbefore sunrise or after sunset. A priest divides the branches with a\r\nspear, and sets aside one portion of them for the god; after which, the\r\ndealer stores away the rest in lumps. There is another account given,\r\nwhich states that a division is made between the gatherers and the\r\nsun, and that it is divided into three portions, after which lots are\r\ntwice drawn, and the share which falls to the sun is left there, and\r\nforthwith ignites spontaneously.\r\n\r\nThe thinnest parts in the sticks, for about a palm in length, are\r\nlooked upon as producing the finest cinnamon; the part that comes next,\r\nthough not quite so long, is the next best, and so on downwards. The\r\nworst of all is that which is nearest the roots, from the circumstance\r\nthat in that part there is the least bark, the portion that is the most\r\nesteemed: hence it is that the upper part of the tree is preferred,\r\nthere being the greatest proportion of bark there. As for the wood, it\r\nis held in no esteem at all, on account of the acrid taste which it\r\nhas, like that of wild marjoram; it is known as xylocinnamum.[558] The\r\nprice of cinnamomum is ten denarii per pound. Some writers make mention\r\nof two kinds of cinnamon, the white and the black: the white was the\r\none that was formerly preferred, but now, on the contrary, the black is\r\nheld in the highest estimation, and the mottled, even, is preferred to\r\nthe white. The most certain test, however, of the goodness of cinnamon\r\nis its not being rough, and the fact that the pieces when rubbed\r\ntogether do not readily crumble to powder. That which is soft is more\r\nparticularly rejected, which is the case, also, when the outer bark too\r\nreadily falls off.\r\n\r\nThe right of regulating the sale of the cinnamon belongs solely\r\nto the king of the Gebanitæ, who opens the market for it by public\r\nproclamation. The price of it was formerly as much as a thousand\r\ndenarii per pound; which was afterwards increased to half as much\r\nagain, in consequence, it is said, of the forests having been set\r\non fire by the barbarians, from motives of resentment; whether this\r\ntook place through any injustice exercised by those in power, or only\r\nby accident, has not been hitherto exactly ascertained. Indeed, we\r\nfind it stated by some authors, that the south winds that prevail in\r\nthese parts are sometimes so hot as to set the forests on fire. The\r\nEmperor Vespasianus Augustus was the first to dedicate in the temples\r\nof the Capitol and the goddess Peace chaplets of cinnamon inserted in\r\nembossed[559] gold. I, myself, once saw in the temple of the Palatium,\r\nwhich his wife Augusta[560] dedicated to her husband the late emperor\r\nAugustus, a root of cinnamon of great weight, placed in a patera of\r\ngold: from it drops used to distil every year, which congealed in hard\r\ngrains. It remained there until the temple was accidentally destroyed\r\nby fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—CASSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCassia[561] is a shrub also, which grows not far from the plains where\r\ncinnamon is produced, but in the mountainous localities; the branches\r\nof it are, however, considerably thicker, than those of cinnamon. It\r\nis covered with a thin skin rather than a bark, and, contrary to what\r\nis the case with cinnamon, it is looked upon as the most valuable when\r\nthe bark falls off and crumbles into small pieces. The shrub is three\r\ncubits in height, and the colours which it assumes are threefold:\r\nwhen it first shoots from the ground, for the length of a foot, it is\r\nwhite; after it has attained that height, it is red for half a foot,\r\nand beyond that it is black. This last is the part that is held in the\r\nhighest esteem, and next to it the portion that comes next, the white\r\npart being the least valued of all. They cut the ends of the branches\r\nto the length of two fingers, and then sew them in the fresh skins\r\nof cattle that have been killed expressly for the purpose; the object\r\nbeing that the skins may putrefy, and the maggots generated thereby\r\nmay eat away the woody parts, and so excavate[562] the bark; which\r\nis so intensely bitter, that it is quite safe from their attacks.\r\nThat which is the freshest is the most highly esteemed; it has a very\r\ndelicate smell, and is so extremely hot to the taste, that it may be\r\nsaid to burn the tongue, rather than gradually warm the mouth. It is\r\nof a purple colour, and though of considerable volume, weighs but very\r\nlittle in comparison; the outer coat forms into short tubes which are\r\nby no means easily broken: this choice kind of cassia, the barbarians\r\ncall by the name of lada. There is another sort, again, which is\r\ncalled balsamodes,[563] because it has a smell like that of balsam,\r\nbut it is bitter; for which reason it is more employed for medicinal\r\npurposes, just as the black cassia is used for unguents. There is no\r\nsubstance known that is subject to greater variations in price: the\r\nbest qualities sell at fifty denarii per pound, others, again, at five.\r\n\r\n(20.) To these varieties the dealers have added another, which they\r\ncall daphnoides,[564] and give it the surname of isocinnamon;[565]\r\nthe price at which it sells is three hundred denarii per pound. It is\r\nadulterated with storax, and, in consequence of the resemblance of\r\nthe bark, with very small sprigs of laurel. Cassia is also planted in\r\nour[566] part of the world, and, indeed, at the extreme verge of the\r\nEmpire, on the banks of the river Rhenus, where it flourishes when\r\nplanted in the vicinity of hives of bees. It has not, however, that\r\nscorched colour which is produced by the excessive heat of the sun; nor\r\nhas it, for the same reason, a similar smell to that which comes from\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—CANCAMUM AND TARUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the confines of the country which produces cinnamon and cassia,\r\ncancamum[567] and tarum[568] are imported; but these substances are\r\nbrought by way of the Nabatæan Troglodytæ, a colony of the Nabatæi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45. (21.)—SERICHATUM AND GABALIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThither, too, are carried serichatum[569] and gabalium, aromatics\r\nwhich the Arabians rear for their own consumption, and which are only\r\nknown by name in our part of the world, though they grow in the same\r\ncountry as cinnamon and cassia. Still, however, serichatum does reach\r\nus occasionally, and is employed by some persons in the manufacture of\r\nunguents. It is purchased at the rate of six denarii per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—MYROBALANUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the country of the Troglodytæ, the Thebais, and the parts of Arabia\r\nwhich separate Judæa from Egypt, myrobalanum[570] is commonly found; it\r\nis provided by Nature for unguents, as from its very name would appear.\r\nFrom its name, also, it is evident that it is the nut of a tree, with\r\na leaf similar to that of the heliotropium, which we shall have to\r\nmention when speaking of the herbs. The fruit of this tree is about the\r\nsize of a filbert. The kind that grows in Arabia is known as Syriaca,\r\nand is white, while, on the other hand, that which grows in the Thebais\r\nis black: the former is preferred for the quality of the oil extracted\r\nfrom it, though that which is produced in the Thebais yields it in\r\nlarger quantities. Among these various kinds, that which is sent from\r\nthe country of the Troglodytæ is the worst of all. There are some\r\npersons who prefer that of Æthiopia[571] to all of these, the nut of\r\nwhich is black, and not oleaginous; it has only a very small kernel,\r\nbut the liquid which is extracted from it is more odoriferous than\r\nthat of the other kinds; it grows, too, in a champaign, open country.\r\nIt is said that the Egyptian nut is even more oleaginous, being of a\r\nreddish colour with a thicker shell, and that the plant, although it\r\ngrows in wet, marshy spots, is shorter and drier than the other kinds.\r\nThe Arabian nut, again, is said to be of a green colour and of smaller\r\nsize, but harder and more compact, from the circumstance that it grows\r\nin mountainous districts. The best of all, however, is that of Petra,\r\nwhich comes from a city mentioned[572] on a previous occasion; it has\r\na black shell, but the kernel is white. The perfumers, however, only\r\nextract the juices from the shells; but medical men pound the kernels,\r\npouring warm water on them, little by little, as they do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47. (22.)—PHŒNICOBALANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the palm in Egypt, which is known by the name of\r\nadipsos,[573] is put to a similar use in unguents, and is held next\r\nin esteem after the myrobalanum. It is of a green colour, has exactly\r\nthe smell of a quince, and has no stone or nut within. It is gathered\r\na little before it begins to ripen. That which is left ungathered is\r\nknown as phœnicobalanus;[574] it turns black, and has a tendency to\r\ninebriate the person who eats of it. The price of myrobalanum is two\r\ndenarii per pound. The shop-keepers give this name also to the dregs of\r\nthe unguent that is made with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48.—THE SWEET-SCENTED CALAMUS;[575] THE SWEET-SCENTED RUSH.\r\n\r\n\r\nScented calamus also, which grows in Arabia, is common to both India\r\nand Syria, that which grows in the last country being superior to\r\nall the rest. At a distance of one hundred and fifty stadia from the\r\nMediterranean, between Mount Libanus and another mountain of no note\r\n(and not, as some have supposed, Antilibanus), there is a valley of\r\nmoderate size, situate in the vicinity of a lake, the marshy swamps of\r\nwhich are dried up every summer. At a distance of thirty stadia from\r\nthis lake grow the sweet-scented calamus and rush. We shall here make\r\nsome further mention of this rush as well, although we have set apart\r\nanother Book for plants of that description, seeing that it is our\r\nobject here to describe all the different materials used for unguents.\r\nThese plants differ in appearance in no respect from others of their\r\nkind; but the calamus, which has the more agreeable smell of the two,\r\nattracts by its odour at a considerable distance, and is softer to the\r\ntouch than the other. The best is the kind which is not so brittle, but\r\nbreaks into long flakes, and not short, like a radish. In the hollow\r\nstalk there is a substance like a cobweb, which is generally known by\r\nthe name of the “flower:” those plants which contain the most of it are\r\nesteemed the best. The other tests of its goodness are its being of a\r\nblack colour—those which are white not being esteemed; besides which,\r\nto be of the very best quality it should be short, thick, and pliant\r\nwhen broken. The price of the scented calamus is eleven, and of the\r\nrush fifteen denarii per pound. It is said that the sweet-scented rush\r\nis to be met with also in Campania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—HAMMONIACUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now departed from the lands which look towards the ocean to\r\nenter upon those which have an aspect towards our seas. (23.) Africa,\r\nwhich lies below Æthiopia, distils a tear-like gum in its sands, called\r\nhammoniacum,[576] the name of which has passed to the oracle of Hammon,\r\nsituate near the tree which produces it. This substance, which is also\r\ncalled metopion,[577] bears a strong resemblance to a resin or a gum.\r\nThere are two kinds of ammoniacum; that to which the name is given of\r\nthrauston, and which bears a resemblance to male frankincense, being\r\nthe kind that is the most esteemed, and that which is known as phyrama,\r\nbeing of an unctuous and resinous nature. This substance is adulterated\r\nby means of sand, which has all the appearance of having adhered to\r\nit during its growth: hence it is greatly preferred when the pieces\r\nare extremely small, and in the purest state possible. The price of\r\nhammoniacum of the best quality is forty asses per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—SPHAGNOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow these countries, and in the province of Cyrenaica, the perfume\r\ncalled sphagnos[578] is found in the highest state of perfection: there\r\nare some who call it by the name of bryon. The sphagnos of Cyprus\r\nholds the second rank, and that of Phœnicia the third. It is said\r\nthat this plant is produced in Egypt also, and in Gaul as well, and I\r\nsee no reason to doubt that such is the fact, for this name is given\r\nto certain white shaggy tufts upon trees, such as we often see upon\r\nthe quercus: those, however, of which we are speaking, emit a most\r\nexquisite odour. The most esteemed of all are the whitest, and those\r\nsituate at the greatest height upon the tree. Those of second quality\r\nare red, while those which are black are not of the slightest value.\r\nThe sphagnos, too, that is produced on islands and among rocks,[579] is\r\nheld in no esteem, as well as all those varieties which have the odour\r\nof the palm-tree, and not that which is so peculiarly their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—CYPROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cyprus[580] is a tree of Egypt, with the leaves of the\r\nziziphus,[581] and seeds like coriander,[582] white and odoriferous.\r\nThese seeds are boiled in olive oil, and then subjected to pressure;\r\nthe product is known to us as cypros. The price of it is five denarii\r\nper pound. The best is that produced on the banks of the Nile, near\r\nCanopus, that of second quality coming from Ascalon in Judæa, and the\r\nthird in estimation for the sweetness of its odour, from the island\r\nof Cyprus. Some people will have it that this is the same as the tree\r\nwhich in Italy we call ligustrum.[583]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—ASPALATHOS, OR ERYSISCEPTRUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same country,[584] too, grows aspalathos,[585] a white, thorny\r\nshrub, the size of a moderate tree, and with flowers like the rose, the\r\nroot of which is in great request for unguents. It is said that every\r\nshrub over which the rainbow is extended is possessed of the sweet\r\nodour that belongs to the aspalathos, but that if the aspalathos is one\r\nof them, its scent is something quite indescribable. Some persons call\r\nthis plant erysisceptrum,[586] and others, again, sceptrum. The proof\r\nof its genuineness is its red or fiery colour; it is also compact to\r\nthe touch, and has the smell of castoreum:[587] it is sold at the rate\r\nof five denarii per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53.—MARON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, too, grows marum,[588] though of inferior quality to that of\r\nLydia, which last has larger leaves, covered with spots. Those of the\r\nother are shorter and smaller, and give out a powerful scent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54. (25.)—BALSAMUM; OPOBALSAMUM; AND XYLOBALSAMUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to all other odours that of balsamum[589] is considered preferable,\r\na plant that has been only bestowed by Nature upon the land of Judæa.\r\nIn former times it was cultivated in two gardens only, both of which\r\nbelonged to the kings of that country: one of them was no more than\r\ntwenty jugera in extent, and the other somewhat smaller. The emperors\r\nVespasianus and Titus had this shrub exhibited at Rome; indeed, it\r\nis worthy of signal remark, that since the time of Pompeius Magnus,\r\nwe have been in the habit of carrying trees even in our triumphal\r\nprocessions. At the present day this tree pays us homage and tribute\r\nalong with its native land, but it has been found to be of altogether a\r\ndifferent nature to that which our own as well as foreign writers had\r\nattributed to it: for, in fact, it bears a much stronger resemblance to\r\nthe vine than to the myrtle. This recent acquisition by conquest has\r\nlearned, like the vine, to be reproduced by mallet[590]-shoots, and it\r\ncovers declivities just like the vine, which supports its own weight\r\nwithout the aid of stays. When it puts forth branches it is pruned in\r\na similar manner, and it thrives by being well raked at the roots,\r\ngrowing with remarkable rapidity, and bearing fruit at the end of three\r\nyears. The leaf bears a very considerable resemblance to that of rue,\r\nand it is an evergreen. The Jews vented their rage upon this shrub just\r\nas they were in the habit of doing against their own lives and persons,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the Romans protected it; indeed, combats have\r\ntaken place before now in defence of a shrub. At the present day the\r\nreproduction of it has become a duty of the fiscal authorities, and the\r\nplants were never known to be more numerous or of larger growth; they\r\nnever exceed the height, however, of a couple of cubits.\r\n\r\nThere are three different kinds of balsamum. The first has a thin and\r\nhair-like foliage, and is known by the name of eutheriston.[591] The\r\nsecond is of a rugged appearance, bending downwards, full of branches,\r\nand more odoriferous than the first; the name of this is trachy. The\r\nthird kind is the eumeces, so called, because it is taller than the\r\nothers; it has a smooth, even, bark. It is the second in quality,\r\nthe eutheriston being inferior to the trachy. The seed of this plant\r\nhas a flavour strongly resembling that of wine; it is of a reddish\r\ncolour, and not without a certain amount of unctuousness; the grains\r\nof inferior quality are lighter in weight and of a greener hue: the\r\nbranches of the shrub are thicker than those of the myrtle. Incisions\r\nare made in it either with glass, or else a sharp stone, or knives made\r\nof bone: it being highly injurious to touch the vital parts with iron,\r\nfor in such case it will immediately wither away and die. On the other\r\nhand, it will allow of all the superfluous branches being pruned away\r\nwith an instrument of iron even. The hand of the person who makes the\r\nincision is generally balanced by an artificial guide, in order that he\r\nmay not accidentally inflict a wound in the wood beyond the bark.\r\n\r\nA juice distils from the wound, which is known to us as opobalsamum;\r\nit is of extraordinary sweetness,[592] but only exudes in tiny drops,\r\nwhich are then collected in wool, and deposited in small horns. When\r\ntaken from out of these, the substance is placed in new earthen\r\nvessels; it bears a strong resemblance to a thick oil, and is of\r\na white colour when fresh. It soon, however, turns red, and as it\r\nhardens loses its transparency. When Alexander the Great waged war in\r\nthose parts, it was looked upon as a fair summer day’s work to fill a\r\nsingle concha[593] with this liquid; the entire produce of the larger\r\ngarden being six congii, and of the smaller one a single congius; the\r\nprice, too, at which it was sold was double its weight in silver. At\r\nthe present day the produce of a single tree, even, is larger; the\r\nincisions are made three times every summer, after which the tree is\r\npruned.\r\n\r\nThe cuttings, too, form an article of merchandize: the fifth year after\r\nthe conquest of Judæa, these cuttings, with the suckers, were sold\r\nfor the price of eight hundred thousand sesterces. These cuttings are\r\ncalled xylobalsamum,[594] and are boiled down for mixing with unguents,\r\nand in the manufactories have been substituted for the juices of the\r\nshrub. The bark is also in great request for medicinal purposes, but it\r\nis the tears that are so particularly valuable; the seed holding the\r\nsecond rank in estimation, the bark the third, and the wood being the\r\nleast esteemed of all. Of the wood, that kind which resembles boxwood\r\nis considered the best: it has also the strongest smell. The best seed\r\nis that which is the largest in size and the heaviest in weight; it has\r\na biting or rather burning taste in the mouth. Balsamum is adulterated\r\nwith hypericon[595] from Petra, but the fraud is easily detected, from\r\nthe fact that the grains of the latter are larger, comparatively empty,\r\nand longer than those of balsamum; they are destitute also of any\r\npungency of smell, and have a flavour like that of pepper.\r\n\r\nAs to the tears of balsamum, the test of their goodness is their\r\nbeing unctuous to the touch, small, of a somewhat reddish colour, and\r\nodoriferous when subjected to friction. That of second-rate quality is\r\nwhite; the green and coarse is inferior, and the black is the worst of\r\nall; for, like olive-oil, it is apt to turn rancid when old. Of all the\r\nincisions, the produce is considered the best of those from which the\r\nliquid has flowed before the formation of the seed. In addition to what\r\nhas been already stated, it is often adulterated with the juice of the\r\nseed, and it is with considerable difficulty that the fraud is detected\r\nby a slight bitterness in the taste, which ought to be delicate and\r\nwithout the slightest mixture of acidity, the only pungency being that\r\nof the smell. It is adulterated also with oil of roses, of cyprus,\r\nof mastich, of balanus, of turpentine, and of myrtle, as also with\r\nresin, galbanum, and Cyprian wax, just as occasion may serve. But the\r\nvery worst adulteration of all, is that which is effected with gum, a\r\nsubstance which is dry when emptied into the hand, and falls to the\r\nbottom when placed in water; both of which are characteristics of\r\nthe genuine commodity. Balsamum, in a genuine state, should be quite\r\nhard, but when it is mixed with gum a brittle pellicle forms upon it.\r\nThe fraud can also be detected by the taste, and when placed upon hot\r\ncoals it may easily be seen if there has been any adulteration with\r\nwax and resin; the flame too, in this case, burns with a blacker smoke\r\nthan when the balsamum is pure. When mixed with honey its qualities\r\nare immediately changed, for it will attract flies even in the hand.\r\nIn addition to these various tests, a drop of pure balsamum, if placed\r\nin luke-warm water will settle to the bottom of the vessel, whereas,\r\nif it is adulterated, it will float upon the surface like oil, and\r\nif it has been drugged with metopion or hammoniacum, a white circle\r\nwill form around it. But the best test of all is, that it will cause\r\nmilk to curdle, and leave no stain upon cloth. In no commodity are\r\nthere practised more palpable frauds than in this, for a sextarius\r\nof balsamum which is sold by the fiscal authorities at three hundred\r\ndenarii, is sold again for a thousand, so vast is the profit to be\r\nderived from increasing this liquid by sophistication. The price of\r\nxylobalsamum is six denarii per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55.—STORAX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat part of Syria joining up to Judæa, and lying above Phœnicia,\r\nproduces storax, which is found in the vicinity of Gabala and\r\nMarathus,[596] as also of Casius, a mountain of Seleucia. The tree[597]\r\nbears the same name, and has a strong resemblance to, the quince. The\r\ntear has a harsh taste, with a pleasant smell; in the interior it has\r\nall the appearance of a reed, and is filled with a liquid juice. About\r\nthe rising of the Dog-star, certain small winged worms hover about\r\nthis substance and eat it away, for which reason it is often found\r\nin a rotten state, with worm-holes full of dust. The storax next in\r\nestimation after that already mentioned, comes from Pisidia, Sidon,\r\nCyprus, and Cilicia; that of Crete being considered the very worst of\r\nall. That which comes from Mount Amanus, in Syria, is highly esteemed\r\nfor medicinal purposes, and even more so by the perfumers. From\r\nwhatever country it comes, that which is of a red colour is preferred,\r\nand it should be both unctuous as well as viscous to the touch; the\r\nworst kind is that which crumbles like bran, and is covered all over\r\nwith a whitish mould. This substance is adulterated with the resin of\r\ncedar or with gum, and sometimes with honey or bitter almonds; all\r\nwhich sophistications may, however, be detected by the taste. The price\r\nof storax of the best quality is seventeen denarii per pound. It comes\r\nalso from Pamphylia, but this last is more arid, and not so full of\r\njuice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—GALBANUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyria produces galbanum too, which grows upon the same mountain of\r\nAmanus: it exudes from a kind of giant-fennel[598] of the same name\r\nas the resin, though sometimes it is known as stagonitis. The kind\r\nthat is the most esteemed is cartilaginous, clear like hammoniacum,\r\nand free from all ligneous substances. Still, however, it is sometimes\r\nadulterated with beans, or with sacopenium.[599] If ignited in a\r\npure state, it has the property of driving away serpents[600] by its\r\nsmoke. It is sold at five denarii per pound, and is only employed for\r\nmedicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57. (26.)—PANAX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyria, too, furnishes panax,[601] an ingredient used in unguents.\r\nThis plant grows also at Psophis in Arcadia, about the sources of the\r\nErymanthus, in Africa also, and in Macedonia. This is a peculiar kind\r\nof giant-fennel, which stands five cubits in height: it first throws\r\nout four leaves, and then six, which lie close to the ground, round,\r\nand of very considerable size; those, however, which grow towards the\r\ntop resemble the leaves of the olive. It bears its seed in certain\r\ntufts, which hang down, just as in the fennel. The juice is obtained\r\nby incisions made in the stalk at harvest-time, and in the root in\r\nautumn. When in a coagulated state, it is esteemed according to its\r\nwhiteness. The next in value is that of a pallid colour, while the\r\nblack is held in no esteem. The price of that of the best quality is\r\ntwo denarii per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—SPONDYLIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference between this kind of giant-fennel and that known as\r\nspondylium,[602] consists only in the leaf, which is smaller, and\r\ndivided like that of the plane-tree. It grows in shady places only. The\r\nseed bears the same name as the plant, and has a strong resemblance to\r\nthat of hart-wort: it is only employed in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59.—MALOBATHRUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyria produces the malobathrum[603] also, a tree which bears a folded\r\nleaf, with just the colour of a leaf when dried. From this plant an\r\noil is extracted for unguents. Egypt produces it in still greater\r\nabundance; but that which is the most esteemed of all comes from India,\r\nwhere it is said to grow in the marshes like the lentil. It has a more\r\npowerful odour than saffron, and has a black, rough appearance, with\r\na sort of brackish taste. The white is the least approved of all, and\r\nit very soon turns musty when old. In taste it ought to be similar to\r\nnard, when placed under the tongue. When made luke-warm in wine, the\r\nodour which it emits is superior to any other. The prices at which this\r\ndrug ranges are something quite marvellous, being from one denarius to\r\nfour hundred per pound; as for the leaf, it generally sells at sixty\r\ndenarii per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60. (27.)—OMPHACIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOmphacium[604] is also a kind of oil, which is obtained from two\r\ntrees, the olive and the vine, by two different methods. It is\r\nproduced from the former by pressing the olive while it is still in\r\nthe white state. That is of an inferior quality which is made from\r\nthe druppa—such being the name that is given to the olive before it\r\nis ripe and fit for food, but already beginning to change its colour.\r\nThe difference between them is, that the latter kind is green, the\r\nformer white. The omphacium that is made from the vine is extracted\r\nfrom either the psythian[605] or the Aminean grape, when the grapes are\r\nabout the size of a chick-pea, just before the rising of the Dog-star.\r\nThe grape is gathered when the first bloom is appearing upon it, and\r\nthe verjuice is extracted, after which the residue[606] is left to dry\r\nin the sun, due precautions being taken against the dews of the night.\r\nThe verjuice, after being collected, is put into earthen vessels, and\r\nthen, after that, stored in jars of Cyprian copper.[607] The best kind\r\nis that which is of a reddish colour, acrid, and dry to the taste. The\r\nprice at which it sells is six denarii per pound. Omphacium is also\r\nmade another way—the unripe grape is pounded in a mortar, after which\r\nit is dried in the sun, and then divided into lozenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 61. (28.)—BRYON, ŒNANTHE, AND MASSARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBryon[608] also bears an affinity to these substances, being the\r\nclusters of berries produced by the white poplar. The best kinds grow\r\nin the vicinity of Cnidos, or in Caria, in spots that are destitute of\r\nwater, or else in dry and rugged localities. A bryon of second-rate\r\nquality is produced from the cedar of Lycia.[609] Œnanthe, too, bears\r\nan affinity to these substances, being the clusters of the wild vine:\r\nit is gathered when it is in flower, or, in other words, when it has\r\nthe finest smell: after which it is dried in the shade upon a linen\r\nsheet spread beneath it, and then stored away in casks. The best sort\r\nis that which comes from Parapotamia;[610] the next best kinds are\r\nthose made at Antiochia and Laodicea in Syria; and that of third-rate\r\nquality, comes from the mountainous parts of Media; this last, however,\r\nis preferable for medicinal purposes. Some persons give the preference\r\nover all to that grown in the island of Cyprus. As to that which comes\r\nfrom Africa, it is solely used for medicinal purposes, being known by\r\nthe name of massaris.[611] Whatever country it may happen to be, the\r\nwhite wild vine produces an œnanthe of superior quality to the black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 62.—ELATE OR SPATHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another tree[612] also, that contributes to the manufacture of\r\nunguents, by some persons known under the name of elate, but which we\r\ncall abies; others again call it a palm, and others give it the name of\r\nspathe. That of Hammonium is the most esteemed, and that of Egypt next,\r\nafter which comes the Syrian tree. It is only odoriferous, however, in\r\nplaces that are destitute of water. The tears of it are of an unctuous\r\nnature, and are employed as an ingredient in unguents, to modify the\r\nharshness of the oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 63.—CINNAMON OR COMACUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Syria, too, is produced that kind of cinnamon which is also known as\r\ncomacum.[613] This is a juice which is extracted from a nut, and very\r\ndifferent from the extract of the real cinnamomum, though it somewhat\r\nresembles it in its agreeable smell. The price at which it sells is\r\nforty asses per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, nine\r\nhundred and seventy-four.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—M.

(1.)—UNGUENTS—AT WHAT PERIOD THEY WERE FIRST INTRODUCED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far we have been speaking of the trees which are valuable for the\r\nodours they produce, and each of which is a subject for our wonder in\r\nitself. Luxury, however, has thought fit to mingle all of these, and\r\nto make a single odour of the whole; hence it is that unguents have\r\nbeen invented.[673] Who was the first to make unguents is a fact not\r\nrecorded. In the times of the Trojan war[674] they did not exist, nor\r\ndid they use incense when sacrificing to the gods; indeed, people knew\r\nof no other smell, or rather stench,[675] I may say, than that of the\r\ncedar and the citrus,[676] shrubs of their own growth, as it arose in\r\nvolumes of smoke from the sacrifices; still, however, even then, the\r\nextract of roses was known, for we find it mentioned as conferring\r\nadditional value on olive-oil.\r\n\r\nWe ought, by good rights, to ascribe the first use of unguents to\r\nthe Persians, for they quite soak themselves in it, and so, by an\r\nadventitious recommendation, counteract the bad odours which are\r\nproduced by dirt. The first instance of the use of unguents that I have\r\nbeen able to meet with is that of the chest[677] of perfumes which fell\r\ninto the hands of Alexander, with the rest of the property of King\r\nDarius, at the taking of his camp.[678] Since those times this luxury\r\nhas been adopted by our own countrymen as well, among the most prized\r\nand, indeed, the most elegant of all the enjoyments of life, and has\r\nbegun even to be admitted in the list of honours paid to the dead;\r\nfor which reason we shall have to enlarge further on that subject.\r\nThose perfumes which are not the produce of shrubs[679] will only be\r\nmentioned for the present by name: the nature of them will, however, be\r\nstated in their appropriate places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF UNGUENTS—TWELVE PRINCIPAL COMPOSITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe names of unguents are due, some of them, to the original place of\r\ntheir composition, others, again, to the extracts which form their\r\nbases, others to the trees from which they are derived, and others to\r\nthe peculiar circumstance under which they were first made: and it is\r\nas well, first of all, to know that in this respect the fashion has\r\noften changed, and that the high repute of peculiar kinds has been but\r\ntransitory. In ancient times, the perfumes the most esteemed of all\r\nwere those of the island of Delos,[680] and at a later period those of\r\nMendes.[681] This degree of esteem is founded, not only on the mode of\r\nmixing them and the relative proportions, but according to the degree\r\nof favour or disfavour in which the various places which produce the\r\ningredients are held, and the comparative excellence or degeneracy of\r\nthe ingredients themselves. The perfume of iris,[682] from Corinth,\r\nwas long held in the highest esteem, till that of Cyzicus came into\r\nfashion. It was the same, too, with the perfume of roses,[683] from\r\nPhaselis,[684] the repute of which was afterwards eclipsed by those\r\nof Neapolis, Capua, and Præneste. Oil of saffron,[685] from Soli in\r\nCilicia, was for a long time held in repute beyond any other, and then\r\nthat from Rhodes; after which perfume of œnanthe,[686] from Cyprus,\r\ncame into fashion, and then that of Egypt was preferred. At a later\r\nperiod that of Adramytteum came into vogue, and then was supplanted by\r\nunguent of marjoram,[687] from Cos, which in its turn was superseded\r\nby quince blossom[688] unguent from the same place. As to perfume of\r\ncyprus,[689] that from the island of Cyprus was at first preferred, and\r\nthen that of Egypt; when all on a sudden the unguents of Mendes and\r\nmetopium[690] rose into esteem. In later times Phœnicia eclipsed Egypt\r\nin the manufacture of these last two, but left to that country the\r\nrepute of producing the best unguent of cyprus.\r\n\r\nAthens has perseveringly maintained the repute of her\r\npanathenaicon.[691] There was formerly a famous unguent, known as\r\n“pardalium,”[692] and made at Tarsus; at the present day its very\r\ncomposition and the mode of mixing it are quite unknown there: they\r\nhave left off, too, making unguent of narcissus[693] from the flowers\r\nof that plant.\r\n\r\nThere are two elements which enter into the composition of unguents,\r\nthe juices and the solid parts. The former generally consist of various\r\nkinds of oils, the latter of odoriferous substances. These last are\r\nknown as hedysmata, while the oils are called stymmata.[694] There\r\nis a third element, which occupies a place between the two, but\r\nhas been much neglected, the colouring matter, namely. To produce a\r\ncolour, however, cinnabar[695] and alkanet[696] are often employed.\r\nIf salt[697] is sprinkled in the oil, it will aid it in retaining its\r\nproperties; but if alkanet has been employed, salt is never used. Resin\r\nand gum are added to fix the odour in the solid perfumes; indeed it\r\nis apt to die away and disappear with the greatest rapidity if these\r\nsubstances are not employed.\r\n\r\nThe unguent which is the most readily prepared of all, and indeed, in\r\nall probability, the very first that was ever made, is that composed of\r\nbryon[698] and oil of balanus,[699] substances of which we have made\r\nmention already. In later times the Mendesian unguent was invented,\r\na more complicated mixture, as resin and myrrh were added to oil of\r\nbalanus, and at the present day they even add metopion[700] as well,\r\nan Egyptian oil extracted from bitter almonds; to which have been\r\nadded omphacium,[701] cardamum,[702] sweet rush,[703] honey,[704]\r\nwine, myrrh, seed of balsamum,[705] galbanum,[706] and resin of\r\nterebinth,[707] as so many ingredients. Among the most common unguents\r\nat the present day, and for that reason supposed to be the most\r\nancient, is that composed of oil of myrtle,[708] calamus, cypress,[709]\r\ncyprus, mastich,[710] and pomegranate-rind.[711] I am of opinion,\r\nhowever, that the unguents which have been the most universally\r\nadopted, are those which are compounded of the rose, a flower that\r\ngrows everywhere; and hence for a long time the composition of oil\r\nof roses was of the most simple nature, though more recently there\r\nhave been added omphacium, rose blossoms, cinnabar, calamus, honey,\r\nsweet-rush, flour of salt or else alkanet,[712] and wine. The same is\r\nthe case, too, with oil of saffron, to which have been lately added\r\ncinnabar, alkanet, and wine; and with oil of sampsuchum,[713] with\r\nwhich omphacium and calamus have been compounded. The best comes from\r\nCyprus and Mitylene, where sampsuchum abounds in large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe commoner kinds of oil, too, are mixed with those of myrrh and\r\nlaurel, to which are added sampsuchum, lilies, fenugreek, myrrh,\r\ncassia,[714] nard,[715] sweet-rush, and cinnamon.[716] There is an oil,\r\ntoo, made of the common quince and the sparrow quince, called melinum,\r\nas we shall have occasion to mention hereafter;[717] it is used as an\r\ningredient in unguents, mixed with omphacium, oil of cyprus, oil of\r\nsesamum,[718] balsamum,[719] sweet-rush, cassia, and abrotonum.[720]\r\nSusinum[721] is the most fluid of them all: it is made of lilies, oil\r\nof balanus, calamus, honey, cinnamon, saffron,[722] and myrrh; while\r\nthe unguent of cyprus[723] is compounded of cyprus, omphacium and\r\ncardamum, calamus, aspalathus,[724] and abrotonum. There are some\r\npersons who, when making unguent of cyprus, employ myrrh also, and\r\npanax:[725] the best is that made at Sidon, and the next best that\r\nof Egypt: care must be taken not to add oil of sesamum: it will keep\r\nas long as four years, and its odour is strengthened by the addition\r\nof cinnamon. Telinum[726] is made of fresh olive-oil, cypirus,[727]\r\ncalamus, melilote,[728] fenugreek, honey, marum,[729] and sweet\r\nmarjoram. This last was the perfume most in vogue in the time of the\r\nComic poet Menander: a considerable time after that known as “megalium”\r\ntook its place, being so called as holding the very highest rank;[730]\r\nit was composed of oil of balanus, balsamum, calamus, sweet-rush,\r\nxylobalsamum,[731] cassia, and resin. One peculiar property of this\r\nunguent is, that it requires to be constantly stirred while boiling,\r\nuntil it has lost all smell: when it becomes cold, it recovers its\r\nodour.[732]\r\n\r\nThere are some single essences also which, individually, afford\r\nunguents of very high character: the first rank is due to\r\nmalobathrum,[733] and the next to the iris of Illyricum and the sweet\r\nmarjoram of Cyzicus, both of them herbs. There are perfumers who\r\nsometimes add some few other ingredients to these: those who use the\r\nmost, employ for the purpose honey, flour of salt, omphacium, leaves\r\nof agnus,[734] and panax, all of them foreign ingredients.[735] The\r\nprice of unguent[736] of cinnamon is quite enormous; to cinnamon\r\nthere is added oil of balanus, xylobalsamum, calamus, sweet-rush,\r\nseeds of balsamum, myrrh, and perfumed honey: it is the thickest in\r\nconsistency of all the unguents; the price at which it sells ranges\r\nfrom thirty-five to three hundred denarii per pound. Unguent[737]\r\nof nard,[738] or foliatum, is composed of omphacium or else oil of\r\nbalanus, sweet-rush, costus,[739] nard, amomum,[740] myrrh, and\r\nbalsamum.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking on this subject, it will be as well to bear in mind that\r\nthere are nine different kinds of plants of a similar kind, of which\r\nwe have already made mention[741] as being employed for the purpose\r\nof imitating Indian nard; so abundant are the materials that are\r\nafforded for adulteration. All these perfumes are rendered still more\r\npungent by the addition of costus and amomum, which have a particularly\r\npowerful effect on the olfactory organs; while myrrh gives them greater\r\nconsistency and additional sweetness, and saffron makes them better\r\nadapted for medicinal purposes. They are most pungent, however, when\r\nmixed with amomum alone, which will often produce head-ache even.\r\nThere are some persons who content themselves with sprinkling the more\r\nprecious ingredients upon the others after boiling them down, for the\r\npurpose of economy; but the strength of the unguent is not so great as\r\nwhen the ingredients have been boiled together. Myrrh used by itself,\r\nand without the mixture of oil, forms an unguent, but it is stacte[742]\r\nonly that must be used, for otherwise it will be productive of too\r\ngreat bitterness. Unguent of cyprus turns other unguents green, while\r\nlily unguent[743] makes them more unctuous: the unguent of Mendes turns\r\nthem black, rose unguent makes them white, and that of myrrh of a\r\npallid hue.\r\n\r\nSuch are the particulars of the ancient inventions, and the various\r\nfalsifications of the shops in later times; we will now pass on to make\r\nmention of what is the very height of refinement in these articles of\r\nluxury, indeed, I may say, the beau ideal[744] of them all.\r\n\r\n(2.) This is what is called the “regal” unguent, from the fact that\r\nit is composed in these proportions for the kings of the Parthians. It\r\nconsists of myrobalanus,[745] costus, amomum, cinnamon, comacum,[746]\r\ncardamum, spikenard, marum, myrrh, cassia, storax,[747] ladanum,[748]\r\nopobalsamum, Syrian calamus[749] and Syrian sweet-rush,[750] œnanthe,\r\nmalobathrum, serichatum,[751] cyprus, aspralathus, panax, saffron,\r\ncypirus, sweet marjoram, lotus,[752] honey, and wine. Not one of\r\nthe ingredients in this compound is produced either in Italy, that\r\nconqueror of the world, or, indeed, in all Europe, with the exception\r\nof the iris, which grows in Illyricum, and the nard, which is to be\r\nfound in Gaul: as to the wine, the rose, the leaves of myrtle, and the\r\nolive-oil, they are possessed by pretty nearly all countries in common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—DIAPASMA, MAGMA; THE MODE OF TESTING UNGUENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose unguents which are known by the name of “diapasma,”[753] are\r\ncomposed of dried perfumes. The lees[754] of unguents are known by\r\nthe name of “magma.[755]” In all these preparations the most powerful\r\nperfume is the one that is added the last of all. Unguents keep best in\r\nboxes of alabaster,[756] and perfumes[757] when mixed with oil, which\r\nconduces all the more to their durability the thicker it is, such as\r\nthe oil of almonds, for instance. Unguents, too, improve with age; but\r\nthe sun is apt to spoil them, for which reason they are usually stowed\r\naway in a shady place in vessels of lead. When their goodness is being\r\ntested, they are placed on the back of the hand, lest the heat of the\r\npalm, which is more fleshy, should have a bad effect upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (3.)—THE EXCESSES TO WHICH LUXURY HAS RUN IN UNGUENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese perfumes form the objects of a luxury which may be looked upon\r\nas being the most superfluous of any, for pearls and jewels, after\r\nall, do pass to a man’s representative,[758] and garments have some\r\ndurability; but unguents lose their odour in an instant, and die away\r\nthe very hour they are used. The very highest recommendation of them\r\nis, that when a female passes by, the odour which proceeds from her may\r\npossibly attract the attention of those even who till then are intent\r\nupon something else. In price they exceed so large a sum even as four\r\nhundred denarii per pound: so vast is the amount that is paid for a\r\nluxury made not for our own enjoyment, but for that of others; for the\r\nperson who carries the perfume about him is not the one, after all,\r\nthat smells it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even here, there are some points of difference that deserve\r\nto be remarked. We read in the works of Cicero,[759] that those\r\nunguents which smell of the earth are preferable to those which smell\r\nof saffron; being a proof, that even in a matter which most strikingly\r\nbespeaks our state of extreme corruptness, it is thought as well to\r\ntemper the vice by a little show of austerity.[760] There are some\r\npersons too who look more particularly for consistency[761] in their\r\nunguents, to which they accordingly give the name of “spissum”;[762]\r\nthus showing that they love not only to be sprinkled, but even to\r\nbe plastered over, with unguents. We have known the very soles[763]\r\neven of the feet to be sprinkled with perfumes; a refinement which\r\nwas taught, it is said, by M. Otho[764] to the Emperor Nero. How, I\r\nshould like to know, could a perfume be at all perceptible, or, indeed,\r\nproductive of any kind of pleasure, when placed on that part of the\r\nbody? We have heard also of a private person giving orders for the\r\nwalls of the bath-room to be sprinkled with unguents, while the Emperor\r\nCaius[765] had the same thing done to his sitting-bath:[766] that this,\r\ntoo, might not be looked upon as the peculiar privilege of a prince, it\r\nwas afterwards done by one of the slaves that belonged to Nero.\r\n\r\nBut the most wonderful thing of all is, that this kind of luxurious\r\ngratification should have made its way into the camp even: at all\r\nevents, the eagles and the standards, dusty as they are, and bristling\r\nwith their sharpened points, are anointed on festive[767] days. I\r\nonly wish it could, by any possibility, be stated who it was that\r\nfirst taught us this practice. It was, no doubt, under the corrupting\r\ninfluence of such temptations as these, that our eagles achieved the\r\nconquest[768] of the world: thus do we seek to obtain their patronage\r\nand sanction for our vices, and make them our precedent for using\r\nunguents even beneath the casque.[769]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5.—WHEN UNGUENTS WERE FIRST USED BY THE ROMANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot exactly say at what period the use of unguents first found\r\nits way to Rome. It is a well-known fact, that when King Antiochus and\r\nAsia[770] were subdued, an edict was published in the year of the City\r\n565, in the censorship of P. Licinius Crassus and L. Julius Cæsar,\r\nforbidding any one to sell exotics;[771] for by that name unguents were\r\nthen called. But, in the name of Hercules! at the present day, there\r\nare some persons who even go so far as to put them in their drink, and\r\nthe bitterness produced thereby is prized to a high degree, in order\r\nthat by their lavishness on these odours they may thus gratify the\r\nsenses of two parts[772] of the body at the same moment.[773] It is a\r\nwell-known historical fact, that L. Plotius,[774] the brother of L.\r\nPlancus, who was twice consul and censor, after being proscribed by\r\nthe Triumvirs, was betrayed in his place of concealment at Salernum by\r\nthe smell of his unguents, a disgrace which more than outweighed all\r\nthe guilt[775] attending his proscription. For who is there that can\r\nbe of opinion that such men as this do not richly deserve to come to a\r\nviolent end?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—THE PALM-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other respects, Egypt is the country that is the best suited of all\r\nfor the production of unguents; and next to it, Campania,[776] from its\r\nabundance of roses.\r\n\r\n(4.) Judæa, too, is greatly renowned for its perfumes, and even still\r\nmore so for its palm-trees,[777] the nature of which I shall take this\r\nopportunity of enlarging upon. There are some found in Europe also.\r\nThey are not uncommon in Italy, but are quite barren there.[778] The\r\npalms on the coast of Spain bear fruit, but it is sour.[779] The fruit\r\nof those of Africa is sweet, but quickly becomes vapid and loses its\r\nflavour; which, however is not the case with the fruit of those that\r\ngrow in the East.[780] From these trees a wine is made, and bread by\r\nsome nations,[781] and they afford an aliment for numerous quadrupeds.\r\nIt will be with very fair reason then, that we shall confine our\r\ndescription to the palm-tree of foreign countries. There are none in\r\nItaly that grow spontaneously,[782] nor, in fact, in any other part of\r\nthe world, with the exception of the warm countries: indeed, it is only\r\nin the very hottest climates that this tree will bear fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—THE NATURE OF THE PALM-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe palm-tree grows in a light and sandy soil, and for the most part of\r\na nitrous quality. It loves the vicinity of flowing water; and as it\r\nis its nature to imbibe the whole of the year, there are some who are\r\nof opinion that in a year of drought it will receive injury from being\r\nmanured even, if the manure is not first mixed with running water:\r\nthis, at least, is the idea entertained by some of the Assyrians.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the palm are numerous. First of all, there are those\r\nwhich do not exceed the size of a shrub; they are mostly barren, though\r\nsometimes they are known to produce fruit; the branches are short, and\r\nthe tree is well covered with leaves all round. In many places this\r\ntree is used as a kind of rough-cast,[783] as it were, to protect the\r\nwalls of houses against damp. The palms of greater height form whole\r\nforests, the trunk of the tree being protected all round by pointed\r\nleaves, which are arranged in the form of a comb; these, it must be\r\nunderstood, are wild palms, though sometimes, by some wayward fancy or\r\nother, they are known to make their appearance among the cultivated\r\nvarieties. The other kinds are tall, round, and tapering; and being\r\nfurnished with dense and projecting knobs or circles in the bark,\r\narranged in regular gradation, they are found easy of ascent by the\r\npeople in the East; in order to do which, the climber fastens a loop of\r\nosier round his body and the trunk, and by this contrivance ascends the\r\ntree with astonishing[784] rapidity. All the foliage is at the summit,\r\nand the fruit as well; this last being situate, not among the leaves,\r\nas is the case with other trees, but hanging in clusters from shoots\r\nof its own among the branches, and partaking of the nature both of the\r\ngrape and the apple. The leaves terminate in a sharp edge, like that of\r\na knife, while the sides are deeply indented—a peculiarity which first\r\ngave the idea of a troop of soldiers presenting face on two sides at\r\nonce; at the present day they are split asunder[785] to form ropes and\r\nwythes for fastening, as well as light umbrellas[786] for covering the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe more diligent[787] enquirers into the operations of Nature state\r\nthat all trees, or rather all plants, and other productions of the\r\nearth, belong to either one sex or the other; a fact which it may be\r\nsufficient to notice on the present occasion, and one which manifests\r\nitself in no tree more than in the palm. The male tree blossoms at\r\nthe shoots; the female buds without blossoming, the bud being very\r\nsimilar to an ear of corn. In both trees the flesh of the fruit shows\r\nfirst, and after that the woody part inside of it, or, in other words,\r\nthe seed: and that this is really the case, is proved by the fact,\r\nthat we often find small fruit on the same shoot without any seed in\r\nit at all. This seed is of an oblong shape, and not rounded like the\r\nolive-stone. It is also divided down the back by a deep indentation,\r\nand in most specimens of this fruit there is exactly in the middle a\r\nsort of navel, as it were, from which the root of the tree first takes\r\nits growth.[788] In planting this seed it is laid on its anterior\r\nsurface, two being placed side by side, while as many more are placed\r\nabove; for when planted singly, the tree that springs up is but weak\r\nand sickly, whereas the four seeds all unite and form one strong tree.\r\nThe seed is divided from the flesh of the fruit by several coats of a\r\nwhitish colour, some of which are attached to the body of it; it lies\r\nbut loosely in the inside of the fruit, adhering only to the summit by\r\na single thread.[789]\r\n\r\nThe flesh of this fruit takes a year to ripen, though in some places,\r\nCyprus[790] for instance, even if it should not reach maturity, it\r\nis very agreeable, for the sweetness of its flavour: the leaf of the\r\ntree too, in that island, is broader than elsewhere, and the fruit\r\nrounder than usual: the body of the fruit however, is never eaten,\r\nbut is always spit[791] out again, after the juice has been extracted.\r\nIn Arabia, the palm fruit is said to have a sickly sweet taste,\r\nalthough Juba says that he prefers the date found among the Arabian\r\nScenitæ,[792] and to which they give the name of “dablan,” before those\r\nof any other country for flavour. In addition to the above particulars,\r\nit is asserted that in a forest of natural growth the female[793] trees\r\nwill become barren if they are deprived of the males, and that many\r\nfemale trees may be seen surrounding a single male with downcast heads\r\nand a foliage that seems to be bowing caressingly towards it; while the\r\nmale tree, on the other hand, with leaves all bristling and erect, by\r\nits exhalations, and even the very sight of it and the dust[794] from\r\noff it, fecundates the others: if the male tree, too, should happen to\r\nbe cut down, the female trees, thus reduced to a state of widowhood,\r\nwill at once become barren and unproductive. So well, indeed, is this\r\nsexual union between them understood, that it has been imagined even\r\nthat fecundation may be ensured through the agency of man, by means of\r\nthe blossoms and the down[795] gathered from off the male trees, and,\r\nindeed, sometimes by only sprinkling the dust from off them on the\r\nfemale trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—HOW THE PALM-TREE IS PLANTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalm-trees are also propagated by planting;[796] the trunk is first\r\ndivided with certain fissures two cubits in length which communicate\r\nwith the pith of the tree, and is then buried in the earth. A slip\r\nalso torn away from the root will produce a sucker with vitality, and\r\nthe same may be obtained from the more tender among the branches. In\r\nAssyria, the tree itself is sometimes laid level, and then covered\r\nover in a moist soil; upon which it will throw out roots all over, but\r\nit will grow only to be a number of shrubs, and never a tree: hence it\r\nis that they plant nurseries, and transplant the young trees when a\r\nyear old, and again when two years old, as they thrive all the better\r\nfor being transplanted; this is done in the spring season in other\r\ncountries, but in Assyria about the rising of the Dog-star. In those\r\nparts they do not touch the young trees with the knife, but merely tie\r\nup the foliage that they may shoot upwards, and so attain considerable\r\nheight. When they are strong they prune them, in order to increase\r\ntheir thickness, but in so doing leave the branches for about half a\r\nfoot; indeed, if they were cut off at any other place, the operation\r\nwould kill the parent tree. We have already[797] mentioned that they\r\nthrive particularly well in a saltish soil; hence, when the soil is not\r\nof that nature, it is the custom to scatter salt, not exactly about the\r\nroots, but at a little distance off. There are palm-trees in Syria and\r\nin Egypt which divide into two trunks, and some in Crete into three and\r\nas many as five even.[798] Some of these trees bear immediately at the\r\nend of three years, and in Cyprus, Syria, and Egypt, when they are four\r\nyears old; others again at the end of five years: at which period the\r\ntree is about the height of a man. So long as the tree is quite young\r\nthe fruit has no seed within, from which circumstance it has received\r\nthe nickname of the “eunuch.”[799]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF PALM-TREES, AND THEIR\r\nCHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous varieties of the palm-tree. In Assyria, and\r\nthroughout the whole of Persis, the barren kinds are made use of for\r\ncarpenters’ work, and the various appliances of luxury. There are\r\nwhole forests also of palm-trees adapted for cutting,[800] and which,\r\nafter they are cut, shoot again from the root; the pith of them\r\ntowards the top, which is usually called the brain[801] of the tree,\r\nis sweet to the taste, and the tree will live even after it has been\r\nextracted, which is the case with no other kind. The name of this tree\r\nis “chamæreps;”[802] it has a broader and softer leaf than the others,\r\nwhich is extremely useful for various kinds of wickerwork;[803] these\r\ntrees are very numerous in Crete, and even more so in Sicily. The wood\r\nof the palm-tree, when ignited, burns both brightly and slowly.[804] In\r\nsome of those that bear fruit,[805] the seed of the fruit is shorter\r\nthan in others, while in some, again, it is longer; in some it is\r\nsofter than in others, and in some harder; in some it is osseous and\r\ncrescent-shaped; polished with a tooth, superstition employs the stone\r\nas an antidote against charms and fascination. This stone is enclosed\r\nin several coats, more or less in number; sometimes they are of a thick\r\ntexture, and sometimes very thin.\r\n\r\nHence it is that we find nine and forty different kinds of palm-trees,\r\nif any one will be at the trouble of enumerating all their various\r\nbarbarous names, and the different wines that are extracted from them.\r\nThe most famous of all, are those which, for the sake of distinction,\r\nhave received the name of “royal” palms, because they were preserved\r\nsolely by the kings of Persia; these used to grow nowhere but at\r\nBabylon, and there only in the garden of Bagoüs,[806] that being the\r\nPersian for an eunuch, several of whom have even reigned over that\r\ncountry! This garden was always carefully retained within[807] the\r\nprecincts of the royal court.\r\n\r\nIn the southern parts of the world, the dates known as “syagri,”[808]\r\nhold the highest rank, and next after them those that are called\r\n“margarides.” These last are short, white, and round, and bear a\r\nstronger resemblance to grapes than to dates; for which reason it is\r\nthat they have received their name, in consequence of their close\r\nresemblance to “margaritæ,” or pearls. It is said that there is only\r\none tree that bears them, and that in the locality known as Chora.[809]\r\nThe same is the case also with the tree that bears the syagri. We\r\nhave heard a wonderful story too, relative to this last tree, to the\r\neffect that it dies and comes to life again in a similar manner to the\r\nphœnix, which, it is generally thought, has borrowed its name from the\r\npalm-tree, in consequence of this peculiarity; at the moment that I\r\nam writing this, that tree is still bearing fruit. As for the fruit\r\nitself, it is large, hard, and of a rough appearance, and differing\r\nin taste from all other kinds, having a sort of wild flavour peculiar\r\nto itself, and not unlike that of the flesh of the wild boar; it is\r\nevidently this circumstance from which it has derived its name of\r\n“syagrus.”\r\n\r\nIn the fourth rank are the dates called “sandalides,” from their\r\nresemblance to a sandal in shape. It is stated, that on the confines\r\nof Æthiopia there are but five of these trees at the most, no less\r\nremarkable for the singular lusciousness of their fruit, than for their\r\nextreme rarity. Next to these, the dates known as “caryotæ”[810] are\r\nthe most esteemed, affording not only plenty of nutriment, but a great\r\nabundance of juice; it is from these that the principal wines[811]\r\nare made in the East; these wines are apt to affect the head, a\r\ncircumstance from which the fruit derives its name. But if these trees\r\nare remarkable for their abundance and fruitfulness, it is in Judæa\r\nthat they enjoy the greatest repute; not, indeed, throughout the whole\r\nof that territory, but more particularly at Hiericus,[812] although\r\nthose that grow at Archelais, Phaselis, and Livias, vallies in the\r\nsame territory, are highly esteemed. The more remarkable quality of\r\nthese is a rich, unctuous juice; they are of a milky consistency,\r\nand have a sort of vinous flavour, with a remarkable sweetness, like\r\nthat of honey. The Nicolaän[813] dates are of a similar kind, but\r\nsomewhat drier; they are of remarkable size, so much so, indeed, that\r\nfour of them, placed end to end, will make a cubit in length. A less\r\nfine kind, but of sister quality to the caryotæ for flavour, are\r\nthe “adelphides,”[814] hence so called; these come next to them in\r\nsweetness, but still are by no means their equals. A third kind, again,\r\nare the patetæ, which abound in juice to excess, so much so, indeed,\r\nthat the fruit bursts, in its excess of liquor, even upon the parent\r\ntree, and presents all the appearance of having been trodden[815] under\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous kinds of dates also, of a drier nature, which are\r\nlong and slender, and sometimes of a curved shape. Those of this sort\r\nwhich we consecrate to the worship of the gods are called “chydæi”[816]\r\nby the Jews, a nation remarkable for the contempt which they manifest\r\nof the divinities. Those found all over Thebais and Arabia are dry\r\nand small, with a shrivelled body: being parched up and scorched by\r\nthe constant heat, they are covered with what more nearly resembles a\r\nshell[817] than a skin. In Æthiopia the date is quite brittle even,\r\nso great is the driness of the climate; hence the people are able to\r\nknead it into a kind of bread, just like so much flour.[818] It grows\r\nupon a shrub, with branches a cubit in length: it has a broad leaf, and\r\nthe fruit is round, and larger than an apple. The name of this date is\r\n“coïx.”[819] It comes to maturity in three years, and there is always\r\nfruit to be found upon the shrub, in various stages of maturity. The\r\ndate of Thebais is at once packed in casks, with all its natural heat\r\nand freshness; for without this precaution, it quickly becomes vapid;\r\nit is of a poor, sickly taste, too, if it is not exposed, before it is\r\neaten, to the heat of an oven.\r\n\r\nThe other kinds of dates appear to be of an ordinary nature, and are\r\ngenerally known as “tragemata;”[820] but in some parts of Phœnicia and\r\nCilicia, they are commonly called “balani,” a name which has been also\r\nborrowed by us. There are numerous kinds of them, which differ from one\r\nanother in being round or oblong; as also in colour, for some of them\r\nare black, and others red—indeed it is said that they present no fewer\r\nvarieties of colour than the fig: the white ones, however, are the most\r\nesteemed. They differ also in size, according to the number which it\r\nrequires to make a cubit in length; some, indeed, are no larger than a\r\nbean. Those are the best adapted for keeping which are produced in salt\r\nand sandy soils, Judæa, and Cyrenaïca in Africa, for instance: those,\r\nhowever, of Egypt, Cyprus, Syria, and Seleucia in Assyria, will not\r\nkeep: hence it is that they are much used for fattening swine and other\r\nanimals. It is a sign that the fruit is either spoilt or old, when the\r\nwhite protuberance disappears, by which it has adhered to the cluster.\r\nSome of the soldiers of Alexander’s army were choked by eating green\r\ndates;[821] and a similar effect is produced in the country of the\r\nGedrosi, by the natural quality of the fruit; while in other places,\r\nagain, the same results arise from eating them to excess. Indeed,\r\nwhen in a fresh state, they are so remarkably luscious, that there\r\nwould be no end to eating them, were it not for fear of the dangerous\r\nconsequences that would be sure to ensue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (5.)—THE TREES OF SYRIA: THE PISTACIA, THE COTTANA, THE\r\nDAMASCENA, AND THE MYXA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the palm, Syria has several trees that are peculiar to\r\nitself. Among the nut-trees there is the pistacia,[822] well known\r\namong us. It is said that, taken either in food or drink, the kernel of\r\nthis nut is a specific against the bite of serpents. Among figs, too,\r\nthere are those known as “caricæ,”[823] together with some smaller ones\r\nof a similar kind, the name of which is “cottana.” There is a plum,\r\ntoo, which grows upon Mount Damascus,[824] as also that known as the\r\n“myxa;”[825] these last two are, however, now naturalized in Italy. In\r\nEgypt, too, they make a kind of wine from the myxa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—THE CEDAR. TREES WHICH HAVE ON THEM THE FRUIT OF THREE YEARS\r\nAT ONCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhœnicia, too, produces a small cedar, which bears a strong resemblance\r\nto the juniper.[826] Of this tree there are two varieties; the one\r\nfound in Lycia, the other in Phœnicia.[827] The difference is in the\r\nleaf: the one in which it is hard, sharp, and prickly, being known as\r\nthe oxycedros,[828] a branchy tree and rugged with knots. The other\r\nkind is more esteemed for its powerful odour. The small cedar produces\r\na fruit the size of a grain of myrrh, and of a sweetish taste. There\r\nare two kinds of the larger cedar[829] also; the one that blossoms\r\nbears no fruit, while, on the other hand, the one that bears fruit has\r\nno blossom, and the fruit, as it falls, is being continually replaced\r\nby fresh. The seed of this tree is similar to that of the cypress. Some\r\npersons give this tree the name of “cedrelates.” The resin produced\r\nfrom it is very highly praised, and the wood of it lasts for ever,\r\nfor which reason it is that they have long been in the habit of using\r\nit for making the statues of the gods. In a temple at Rome there is\r\na statue of Apollo Sosianus[830] in cedar, originally brought from\r\nSeleucia. There is a tree similar to the cedar, found also in Arcadia;\r\nand there is a shrub that grows in Phrygia, known as the “cedrus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (6.)—THE TEREBINTH.[831]\r\n\r\n\r\nSyria, too, produces the terebinth, the male tree of which bears no\r\nfruit, and the female consists of two different varieties;[832] one\r\nof these bears a red fruit, the size of a lentil, while the other\r\nis pale, and ripens at the same period as the grape. This fruit is\r\nnot larger than a bean, is of a very agreeable smell, and sticky and\r\nresinous to the touch. About Ida in Troas, and in Macedonia, this tree\r\nis short and shrubby, but at Damascus, in Syria, it is found of very\r\nconsiderable size. Its wood is remarkably flexible, and continues sound\r\nto a very advanced age: it is black and shining. The blossoms appear\r\nin clusters, like those of the olive-tree, but are of a red colour;\r\nthe leaves are dense, and closely packed. It produces follicules, too,\r\nfrom which issue certain insects like gnats, as also a kind of resinous\r\nliquid[833] which oozes from the bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—THE SUMACH-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe male sumach-tree[834] of Syria is productive, but the female is\r\nbarren. The leaf resembles that of the elm, though it is a little\r\nlonger, and has a downy surface. The footstalks of the leaves lie\r\nalways alternately in opposite directions, and the branches are short\r\nand slender. This tree is used in the preparation of white skins.[835]\r\nThe seed, which strongly resembles a lentil in appearance, turns red\r\nwith the grape; it is known by the name of “ros,” and forms a necessary\r\ningredient in various medicaments.[836]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (7.)—THE TREES OF EGYPT. THE FIG-TREE OF ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nEgypt, too, has many trees which are not to be found elsewhere, and the\r\nkind of fig more particularly, which for this reason has been called\r\nthe Egyptian fig.[837] In leaf this tree resembles the mulberry-tree,\r\nas also in size and general appearance. It bears fruit, not upon\r\nbranches, but upon the trunk itself: the fig is remarkable for its\r\nextreme sweetness, and has no seeds[838] in it. This tree is also\r\nremarkable for its fruitfulness, which, however, can only be ensured by\r\nmaking incisions[839] in the fruit with hooks of iron, for otherwise\r\nit will not come to maturity. But when this has been done, it may be\r\ngathered within four days, immediately upon which another shoots up\r\nin its place. Hence it is that in the year it produces seven abundant\r\ncrops, and throughout all the summer there is an abundance of milky\r\njuice in the fruit. Even if the incisions are not made, the fruit will\r\nshoot afresh four times during the summer, the new fruit supplanting\r\nthe old, and forcing it off before it has ripened. The wood, which is\r\nof a very peculiar nature, is reckoned among the most useful known.\r\nWhen cut down it is immediately plunged into standing water, such being\r\nthe means employed for drying[840] it. At first it sinks to the bottom,\r\nafter which it begins to float, and in a certain length of time the\r\nadditional moisture sucks it dry, which has the effect of penetrating\r\nand soaking all[841] other kinds of wood. It is a sign that it is fit\r\nfor use[842] when it begins to float.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—THE FIG-TREE OF CYPRUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fig-tree that grows in Crete, and is known there as the Cyprian\r\nfig,[843] bears some resemblance to the preceding one; for it bears\r\nfruit upon the trunk of the tree, and upon the branches as well, when\r\nthey have attained a certain degree of thickness. This tree, however,\r\nsends forth buds without any leaves,[844] but similar in appearance to\r\na root. The trunk of the tree is similar to that of the poplar, and\r\nthe leaves to those of the elm. It produces four crops in the year,\r\nand germinates the same number of times, but its green[845] fruit will\r\nnot ripen unless an incision is made in it to let out the milky juice.\r\nThe sweetness of the fruit and the appearance of the inside are in all\r\nrespects similar to those of the fig, and in size it is about as large\r\nas a sorb-apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (8.)—THE CAROB-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar to this is the carob-tree, by the Ionians known as the\r\n“ceraunia,”[846] which in a similar manner bears fruit from the trunk,\r\nthis fruit being known by the name of “siliqua,” or “pod.” For this\r\nreason, committing a manifest error, some persons[847] have called it\r\nthe Egyptian fig; it being the fact that this tree does not grow in\r\nEgypt, but in Syria and Ionia, in the vicinity, too, of Cnidos, and\r\nin the island of Rhodes. It is always covered with leaves, and bears\r\na white flower with a very powerful odour. It sends forth shoots at\r\nthe lower part, and is consequently quite yellow on the surface, as\r\nthe young suckers deprive the trunk of the requisite moisture. When\r\nthe fruit of the preceding year is gathered, about the rising of the\r\nDog-star, fresh fruit immediately makes its appearance; after which the\r\ntree blossoms while the constellation of Arcturus[848] is above the\r\nhorizon, and the winter imparts nourishment to the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (9.)—THE PERSIAN TREE. IN WHAT TREES THE FRUITS GERMINATE THE\r\nONE BELOW THE OTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEgypt, too, produces another tree of a peculiar description, the\r\nPersian[849] tree, similar in appearance to the pear-tree, but\r\nretaining its leaves during the winter. This tree produces without\r\nintermission, for if the fruit is pulled to-day, fresh fruit will\r\nmake its appearance to-morrow: the time for ripening is while the\r\nEtesian[850] winds prevail. The fruit of this tree is more oblong than\r\na pear, but is enclosed in a shell and a rind of a grassy colour, like\r\nthe almond; but what is found within, instead of being a nut as in the\r\nalmond, is a plum, differing from the almond[851] in being shorter and\r\nquite soft. This fruit, although particularly inviting for its luscious\r\nsweetness, is productive of no injurious effects. The wood, for its\r\ngoodness, solidity, and blackness, is in no respect inferior to that\r\nof the lotus: people have been in the habit of making statues of it.\r\nThe wood of the tree which we have mentioned as the “balanus,”[852]\r\nalthough very durable, is not so highly esteemed as this, as it is\r\nknotted and twisted in the greater part: hence it is only employed for\r\nthe purposes of ship-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—THE CUCUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the wood of the cucus[853] is held in very high\r\nesteem. It is similar in nature to the palm, as its leaves are\r\nsimilarly used for the purposes of texture: it differs from it,\r\nhowever, in spreading out its arms in large branches. The fruit, which\r\nis of a size large enough to fill the hand, is of a tawny colour, and\r\nrecommends itself by its juice, which is a mixture of sweet and rough.\r\nThe seed in the inside is large and of remarkable hardness, and turners\r\nuse it for making curtain rings.[854] The kernel is sweet, while fresh;\r\nbut when dried it becomes hard to a most remarkable degree, so much so,\r\nthat it can only be eaten after being soaked in water for several days.\r\nThe wood is beautifully mottled with circling veins,[855] for which\r\nreason it is particularly esteemed among the Persians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—THE EGYPTIAN THORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo less esteemed, too, in the same country, is a certain kind of\r\nthorn,[856] though only the black variety, its wood being imperishable,\r\nin water even, a quality which renders it particularly valuable for\r\nmaking the sides of ships: on the other hand, the white kinds will\r\nrot very rapidly. It has sharp, prickly thorns on the leaves even,\r\nand bears its seeds in pods; they are employed for the same purposes\r\nas galls in the preparation of leather. The flower, too, has a pretty\r\neffect when made into garlands, and is extremely useful in medicinal\r\npreparations. A gum, also, distils from this tree; but the principal\r\nmerit that it possesses is, that when it is cut down, it will grow\r\nagain within three years. It grows in the vicinity of Thebes, where we\r\nalso find the quercus, the Persian tree, and the olive: the spot that\r\nproduces it is a piece of woodland, distant three hundred stadia from\r\nthe Nile, and watered by springs of its own.\r\n\r\n(10.) Here we find, too, the Egyptian[857] plum-tree, not much unlike\r\nthe thorn last mentioned, with a fruit similar to the medlar, and which\r\nripens in the winter. This tree never loses its leaves. The seed in\r\nthe fruit is of considerable size, but the flesh of it, by reason of\r\nits quality, and the great abundance in which it grows, affords quite\r\na harvest to the inhabitants of those parts; after cleaning it, they\r\nsubject it to pressure, and then make it up into cakes for keeping.\r\nThere was formerly[858] a woodland district in the vicinity of Memphis,\r\nwith trees of such enormous size, that three men could not span one\r\nwith their arms: one of these trees is remarkable, not for its fruit,\r\nor any particular use that it is, but for the singular phænomenon that\r\nit presents. In appearance it strongly resembles a thorn,[859] and\r\nit has leaves which have all the appearance of wings, and which fall\r\nimmediately the branch is touched by any one, and then immediately\r\nshoot again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20. (11.)—NINE KINDS OF GUM. THE SARCOCOLLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is universally agreed, that the best gum is that produced from the\r\nEgyptian thorn;[860] it is of variegated appearance, of azure colour,\r\nclean, free from all admixture of bark, and adheres to the teeth; the\r\nprice at which it sells is three denarii per pound. That produced from\r\nthe bitter almond-tree and the cherry[861] is of an inferior kind,\r\nand that which is gathered from the plum-tree is the worst of all. The\r\nvine, too, produces a gum,[862] which is of the greatest utility in\r\nhealing the sores of children; while that which is sometimes found on\r\nthe olive-tree[863] is used for the tooth-ache. Gum is also found on\r\nthe elm[864] upon Mount Corycus in Cilicia, and upon the juniper,[865]\r\nbut it is good for nothing; indeed, the gum of the elm found there is\r\napt to breed gnats. From the sarcocolla[866] also—such is the name of\r\na certain tree—a gum exudes that is remarkably useful to painters[867]\r\nand medical men; it is similar to incense dust in appearance, and for\r\nthose purposes the white kind is preferable to the red. The price of it\r\nis the same as that mentioned above.[868]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—THE PAPYRUS: THE USE OF PAPER; WHEN IT WAS FIRST INVENTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have not as yet taken any notice of the marsh plants, nor yet of\r\nthe shrubs that grow upon the banks of rivers: before quitting Egypt,\r\nhowever, we must make some mention of the nature of the papyrus, seeing\r\nthat all the usages of civilized life depend in such a remarkable\r\ndegree upon the employment of paper—at all events, the remembrance\r\nof past events. M. Varro informs us that paper owes its discovery to\r\nthe victorious[869] career of Alexander the Great, at the time when\r\nAlexandria in Egypt was founded by him; before which period paper\r\nhad not been used, the leaves of the palm having been employed for\r\nwriting at an early period, and after that the bark of certain trees.\r\nIn succeeding ages, public documents were inscribed on sheets of lead,\r\nwhile private memoranda were impressed upon linen cloths, or else\r\nengraved on tablets of wax; indeed, we find it stated in Homer,[870]\r\nthat tablets were employed for this purpose even before the time of\r\nthe Trojan war. It is generally supposed, too, that the country which\r\nthat poet speaks of as Egypt, was not the same that is at present\r\nunderstood by that name, for the Sebennytic and the Saitic[871] Nomes,\r\nin which all the papyrus is produced, have been added since his time by\r\nthe alluvion of the Nile; indeed, he himself has stated[872] that the\r\nmain-land was a day and a night’s sail from the island of Pharos[873],\r\nwhich island at the present day is united by a bridge to the city\r\nof Alexandria. In later times, a rivalry having sprung up between\r\nKing Ptolemy and King Eumenes,[874] in reference to their respective\r\nlibraries, Ptolemy prohibited the export of papyrus; upon which,\r\nas Varro relates, parchment was invented for a similar purpose at\r\nPergamus. After this, the use of that commodity, by which immortality\r\nis ensured to man, became universally known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22.—THE MODE OF MAKING PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nPapyrus grows either in the marshes of Egypt, or in the sluggish waters\r\nof the river Nile, when they have overflowed and are lying stagnant,\r\nin pools that do not exceed a couple of cubits in depth. The root lies\r\nobliquely,[875] and is about the thickness of one’s arm; the section\r\nof the stalk is triangular, and it tapers gracefully upwards towards\r\nthe extremity, being not more than ten cubits at most in height. Very\r\nmuch like a thyrsus[876] in shape, it has a head on the top, which\r\nhas no seed[877] in it, and, indeed, is of no use whatever, except as\r\na flower employed to crown the statues of the gods. The natives use\r\nthe roots by way of wood, not only for firing, but for various other\r\ndomestic purposes as well. From the papyrus itself they construct\r\nboats[878] also, and of the outer coat they make sails and mats, as\r\nwell as cloths, besides coverlets and ropes; they chew it also, both\r\nraw and boiled, though they swallow the juice only.\r\n\r\nThe papyrus grows in Syria also, on the borders of the same lake around\r\nwhich grows the sweet-scented calamus;[879] and King Antiochus used\r\nto employ the productions of that country solely as cordage for naval\r\npurposes; for the use of spartum[880] had not then become commonly\r\nknown. More recently it has been understood that a papyrus grows in\r\nthe river Euphrates, in the vicinity of Babylon, from which a similar\r\nkind of paper may easily be produced: still, however, up to the present\r\ntime the Parthians have preferred to impress[881] their characters upon\r\ncloths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23. (12)—THE NINE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper is made from the papyrus, by splitting it with a needle into\r\nvery thin leaves, due care being taken that they should be as broad\r\nas possible. That of the first quality is taken from the centre of\r\nthe plant, and so in regular succession, according to the order of\r\ndivision. “Hieratica”[882] was the name that was anciently given\r\nto it, from the circumstance that it was entirely reserved for the\r\nreligious books. In later times, through a spirit of adulation, it\r\nreceived the name of “Augusta,” just as that of second quality was\r\ncalled “Liviana,” from his wife, Livia; the consequence of which was,\r\nthat the name “hieratica” came to designate that of only third-rate\r\nquality. The paper of the next quality was called “amphitheatrica,”\r\nfrom the locality[883] of its manufacture. The skilful manufactory that\r\nwas established by Fannius[884] at Rome, was in the habit of receiving\r\nthis last kind, and there, by a very careful process of insertion, it\r\nwas rendered much finer; so much so, that from being a common sort,\r\nhe made it a paper of first-rate quality, and gave his own[885] name\r\nto it: while that which was not subjected to this additional process\r\nretained its original name of “amphitheatrica.” Next to this is\r\nthe Saitic paper, so called from the city of that name,[886] where\r\nit is manufactured in very large quantities, though of cuttings of\r\ninferior[887] quality. The Tæniotic paper, so called from a place in\r\nthe vicinity,[888] is manufactured from the materials that lie nearer\r\nto the outside skin; it is sold, not according to its quality, but by\r\nweight only. As to the paper that is known as “emporetica,”[889] it\r\nis quite useless for writing upon, and is only employed for wrapping\r\nup other paper, and as a covering for various articles of merchandize,\r\nwhence its name, as being used by dealers. After this comes the bark of\r\nthe papyrus, the outer skin of which bears a strong resemblance to the\r\nbulrush, and is solely used for making ropes, and then only for those\r\nwhich have to go into the water.[890]\r\n\r\nAll these various kinds of paper are made upon a table, moistened with\r\nNile water; a liquid which, when in a muddy state, has the peculiar\r\nqualities of glue.[891] This table being first inclined,[892] the\r\nleaves of papyrus are laid upon it lengthwise, as long, indeed, as the\r\npapyrus will admit of, the jagged edges being cut off at either end;\r\nafter which a cross layer is placed over it, the same way, in fact,\r\nthat hurdles are made. When this is done, the leaves are pressed close\r\ntogether, and then dried in the sun; after which they are united to one\r\nanother, the best sheets being always taken first, and the inferior\r\nones added afterwards. There are never more than twenty of these sheets\r\nto a roll.[893]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—THE MODE OF TESTING THE GOODNESS OF PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference in the breadth of the various kinds of\r\npaper. That of best quality[894] is thirteen fingers wide, while the\r\nhieratica is two fingers less. The Fanniana is ten fingers wide, and\r\nthat known as “amphitheatrica,” one less. The Saitic is of still\r\nsmaller breadth, indeed it is not so wide as the mallet with which the\r\npaper is beaten; and the emporetica is particularly narrow, being not\r\nmore than six fingers in breadth.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above particulars, paper is esteemed according\r\nto its fineness, its stoutness, its whiteness, and its smoothness.\r\nClaudius Cæsar effected a change in that which till then had been\r\nlooked upon as being of the first quality: for the Augustan paper had\r\nbeen found to be so remarkably fine, as to offer no resistance to the\r\npressure of the pen; in addition to which, as it allowed the writing\r\nupon it to run through, it was continually causing apprehensions of\r\nits being blotted and blurred by the writing on the other side; the\r\nremarkable transparency, too, of the paper was very unsightly to the\r\neye. To obviate these inconveniences, a groundwork of paper was made\r\nwith leaves of the second quality, over which was laid a woof, as it\r\nwere, formed of leaves of the first. He increased the width also of\r\npaper; the width [of the common sort] being made a foot, and that of\r\nthe size known as “macrocollum,”[895] a cubit; though one inconvenience\r\nwas soon detected in it, for, upon a single leaf[896] being torn in\r\nthe press, more pages were apt to be spoilt than before.[897] In\r\nconsequence of the advantages above-mentioned, the Claudian has come to\r\nbe preferred to all other kinds of paper, though the Augustan is still\r\nused for the purposes of epistolary correspondence. The Livian, which\r\nhad nothing in common with that of first quality, but was entirely of a\r\nsecondary rank, still holds its former place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—THE PECULIAR DEFECTS IN PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe roughness and inequalities in paper are smoothed down with a\r\ntooth[898] or shell; but the writing in such places is very apt to\r\nfade. When it is thus polished the paper does not take the ink so\r\nreadily, but is of a more lustrous and shining surface. The water\r\nof the Nile that has been originally employed in its manufacture,\r\nbeing sometimes used without due precaution, will unfit the paper for\r\ntaking writing: this fault, however, may be detected by a blow with\r\nthe mallet, or even by the smell,[899] when the carelessness has been\r\nextreme. These spots, too, may be detected by the eye; but the streaks\r\nthat run down the middle of the leaves where they have been pasted\r\ntogether, though they render the paper spongy and of a soaking nature,\r\ncan hardly ever be detected before the ink runs, while the pen is\r\nforming the letters; so many are the openings for fraud to be put in\r\npractice. The consequence is, that another labour has been added to the\r\ndue preparation of paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—THE PASTE USED IN THE PREPARATION OF PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common paper paste is made of the finest flour of wheat mixed with\r\nboiling water, and some small drops of vinegar sprinkled in it: for the\r\nordinary workman’s paste, or gum, if employed for this purpose, will\r\nrender the paper brittle. Those, however, who take the greatest pains,\r\nboil the crumb of leavened bread, and then strain off the water: by the\r\nadoption of this method the paper has the fewest seams caused by the\r\npaste that lies between, and is softer than the nap of linen even. All\r\nkinds of paste that are used for this purpose, ought not to be older\r\nor newer than one day. The paper is then thinned out with a mallet,\r\nafter which a new layer of paste is placed upon it; then the creases\r\nwhich have formed are again pressed out, and it then undergoes the same\r\nprocess with the mallet as before. It is thus that we have memorials\r\npreserved in the ancient handwriting of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus,\r\nwhich I have seen in the possession of Pomponius Secundus,[900] the\r\npoet, a very illustrious citizen, almost two hundred years since those\r\ncharacters were penned. As for the handwriting of Cicero, Augustus, and\r\nVirgil, we frequently see them at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27. (13.)—THE BOOKS OF NUMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some facts of considerable importance which make against the\r\nopinion expressed by M. Varro, relative to the invention of paper.\r\nCassius Hemina, a writer of very great antiquity, has stated in the\r\nFourth Book of his Annals, that Cneius Terentius, the scribe, while\r\nengaged in digging on his land in the Janiculum, came to a coffer,\r\nin which Numa had been buried, the former king of Rome, and that in\r\nthis coffer were also found some books[901] of his. This took place\r\nin the consulship of Publius Cornelius Cethegus, the son of Lucius,\r\nand of M. Bæbius Tamphilus, the son of Quintus, the interval between\r\nwhose consulship and the reign of Numa was five hundred and thirty-five\r\nyears. These books were made of paper, and, a thing that is more\r\nremarkable still, is the fact that they lasted so many years buried in\r\nthe ground. In order, therefore, to establish a fact of such singular\r\nimportance, I shall here quote the words of Hemina himself—“Some\r\npersons expressed wonder how these books could have possibly lasted so\r\nlong a time—this was the explanation that Terentius gave: ‘In nearly\r\nthe middle of the coffer there lay a square stone, bound on every side\r\nwith cords enveloped in wax;[902] upon this stone the books had been\r\nplaced, and it was through this precaution, he thought, that they\r\nhad not rotted. The books, too, were carefully covered with citrus\r\nleaves,[903] and it was through this, in his belief, that they had\r\nbeen protected from the attacks of worms.’ In these books were written\r\ncertain doctrines relative to the Pythagorean philosophy; they were\r\nburnt by Q. Petilius, the prætor, because they treated of philosophical\r\nsubjects.”[904]\r\n\r\nPiso, who had formerly been censor, relates the same facts in the\r\nFirst Book of his Commentaries, but he states in addition, that there\r\nwere seven books on Pontifical Rights, and seven on the Pythagorean\r\nphilosophy.[905] Tuditanus, in his Fourteenth Book, says that they\r\ncontained the decrees of Numa: Varro, in the Seventh Book of his\r\n“Antiquities of Mankind,”[906] states that they were twelve in number;\r\nand Antias, in his Second Book, says that there were twelve written\r\nin Latin, on pontifical matters, and as many in Greek, containing\r\nphilosophical precepts. The same author states also in his Third Book\r\nwhy it was thought proper to burn them.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact acknowledged by all writers, that the Sibyl[907] brought\r\nthree books to Tarquinius Superbus, of which two were burnt by herself,\r\nwhile the third perished by fire with the Capitol[908] in the days\r\nof Sylla. In addition to these facts, Mucianus, who was three times\r\nconsul, has stated that he had recently read, while governor of Lycia,\r\na letter written upon paper, and preserved in a certain temple there,\r\nwhich had been written from Troy, by Sarpedon; a thing that surprises\r\nme the more, if it really was the fact that even in the time of Homer\r\nthe country that we call Egypt was not in existence.[909] And why too,\r\nif paper was then in use, was it the custom, as it is very well known\r\nit was, to write upon leaden tablets and linen cloths? Why, too, has\r\nHomer[910] stated that in Lycia tablets[911] were given to Bellerophon\r\nto carry, and not a paper letter?\r\n\r\nPapyrus, for making paper, is apt to fail occasionally; such a thing\r\nhappened in the time of the Emperor Tiberius, when there was so great\r\na scarcity[912] of paper that members of the senate were appointed\r\nto regulate the distribution of it: had not this been done, all the\r\nordinary relations of life would have been completely disarranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28. (14.)—THE TREES OF ÆTHIOPIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆthiopia, which borders upon Egypt, has in general no remarkable trees,\r\nwith the exception of the wool-bearing[913] ones, of which we have had\r\noccasion to speak[914] in our description of the trees of India and\r\nArabia. However, the produce of the tree of Æthiopia bears a much\r\nstronger resemblance to wool, and the follicule is much larger, being\r\nvery similar in appearance to a pomegranate; as for the trees, they are\r\notherwise similar in every respect. Besides this tree, there are some\r\npalms, of which we have spoken already.[915] In describing the islands\r\nalong the coast of Æthiopia, we have already made mention[916] of their\r\ntrees and their odoriferous forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29. (15.)—THE TREES OF MOUNT ATLAS. THE CITRUS, AND THE TABLES\r\nMADE OF THE WOOD THEREOF.\r\n\r\n\r\nMount Atlas is said to possess a forest of trees of a peculiar\r\ncharacter,[917] of which we have already spoken.[918] In the vicinity\r\nof this mountain is Mauretania, a country which abounds in the\r\ncitrus,[919] a tree which gave rise to the mania[920] for fine tables,\r\nan extravagance with which the women reproach the men, when they\r\ncomplain of their vast outlay upon pearls. There is preserved to the\r\npresent day a table which belonged to M. Cicero,[921] and for which,\r\nnotwithstanding his comparatively moderate means, and what is even\r\nmore surprising still, at that day too, he gave no less than one[922]\r\nmillion sesterces: we find mention made also of one belonging to Gallus\r\nAsinius, which cost one million one hundred thousand sesterces. Two\r\ntables were also sold by auction which had belonged to King Juba; the\r\nprice fetched by one was one million two hundred thousand sesterces,\r\nand that of the other something less. There has been lately destroyed\r\nby fire, a table which came down from the family of the Cethegi, and\r\nwhich had been sold for the sum of one million four hundred thousand\r\nsesterces, the price of a considerable domain, if any one, indeed,\r\ncould be found who would give so large a sum for an estate.\r\n\r\nThe largest table that has ever yet been known was one that belonged\r\nto Ptolemæus, king of Mauretania; it was made of two semicircumferences\r\njoined together down the middle, being four feet and a half in\r\ndiameter, and a quarter of a foot in thickness: the most wonderful\r\nfact, however, connected with it, was the surprising skill with which\r\nthe joining had been concealed,[923] and which rendered it more\r\nvaluable than if it had been by nature a single piece of wood. The\r\nlargest table that is made of a single piece of wood, is the one that\r\ntakes its name[924] from Nomius, a freedman of Tiberius Cæsar. The\r\ndiameter of it is four feet, short by three quarters of an inch, and\r\nit is half a foot in thickness, less the same fraction. While speaking\r\nupon this subject, I ought not to omit to mention that the Emperor\r\nTiberius had a table that exceeded four feet in diameter by two inches\r\nand a quarter, and was an inch and a half in thickness: this, however,\r\nwas only covered with a veneer of citrus-wood, while that which\r\nbelonged to his freedman Nomius was so costly, the whole material of\r\nwhich it was composed being knotted[925] wood.\r\n\r\nThese knots are properly a disease or excrescence of the root, and\r\nthose used for this purpose are more particularly esteemed which have\r\nlain entirely concealed under ground; they are much more rare than\r\nthose that grow above ground, and that are to be found on the branches\r\nalso. Thus, to speak correctly, that which we buy at so vast a price is\r\nin reality a defect in the tree: of the size and root of it a notion\r\nmay be easily formed from the circular sections of its trunk. The tree\r\nresembles the wild female cypress[926] in its foliage, smell, and the\r\nappearance of the trunk. A spot called Mount Ancorarius, in Nearer\r\nMauretania, used formerly to furnish the most esteemed citrus-wood, but\r\nat the present day the supply is quite exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—THE POINTS THAT ARE DESIRABLE OR OTHERWISE IN THESE TABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal merit of these tables is to have veins[927] arranged in\r\nwaving lines, or else forming spirals like so many little whirlpools.\r\nIn the former arrangement the lines run in an oblong direction, for\r\nwhich reason these are called “tiger”[928] tables; while in the\r\nlatter the marks are circling and spiral, and hence they are styled\r\n“panther”[929] tables. There are some tables also with wavy, undulating\r\nmarks, and which are more particularly esteemed if these resemble the\r\neyes on a peacock’s tail. Next in esteem to these last, as well as\r\nthose previously mentioned, is the veined wood,[930] covered, as it\r\nwere, with dense masses of grain, for which reason these tables have\r\nreceived the name of “apiatæ.”[931] But the colour of the wood is the\r\nquality that is held in the highest esteem of all: that of wine mixed\r\nwith honey[932] being the most prized, the veins being peculiarly\r\nrefulgent. Next to the colour, it is the size that is prized; at the\r\npresent day whole trunks are greatly admired, and sometimes several are\r\nunited in a single table.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar defects in these kinds of tables are woodiness,[933]\r\nsuch being the name given to the table when the wood is dull,\r\ncommon-looking, indistinct, or else has mere simple marks upon it,\r\nresembling the leaves of the plane-tree; also, when it resembles the\r\nveins of the holm-oak or the colour of that tree; and, a fault to\r\nwhich it is peculiarly liable from the effect of heat or wind, when\r\nit has flaws in it or hair-like lines resembling flaws; when it has a\r\nblack mark, too, running through it resembling a murena in appearance,\r\nvarious streaks that look like crow scratches, or knots like poppy\r\nheads, with a colour all over nearly approaching to black, or blotches\r\nof a sickly hue. The barbarous tribes bury this wood in the ground\r\nwhile green, first giving it a coating of wax. When it comes into the\r\nworkmen’s hands, they put it for seven days beneath a heap of corn, and\r\nthen take it out for as many more: it is quite surprising how greatly\r\nit loses in weight by this process. Shipwrecks have recently taught us\r\nalso that this wood is dried by the action of sea-water, and that it\r\nthereby acquires a hardness[934] and a degree of density which render\r\nit proof against corruption: no other method is equally sure to produce\r\nthese results. These tables are kept best, and shine with the greatest\r\nlustre, when rubbed with the dry hand, more particularly just after\r\nbathing. As if this wood had been created for the behoof of wine, it\r\nreceives no injury from it.\r\n\r\n(16.) As this tree is one among the elements of more civilized life,\r\nI think that it is as well on the present occasion to dwell a little\r\nfurther upon it. It was known to Homer even, and in the Greek it is\r\nknown by the name of “thyon,”[935] or sometimes “thya.” He says that\r\nthe wood of this tree was among the unguents that were burnt for\r\ntheir pleasant odour by Circe,[936] whom he would represent as being\r\na goddess; a circumstance which shows the great mistake committed by\r\nthose who suppose that perfumes are meant under that name,[937] seeing\r\nthat in the very same line he says that cedar and larch were burnt\r\nalong with this wood, a thing that clearly proves that it is only of\r\ndifferent trees that he is speaking. Theophrastus, an author who wrote\r\nin the age succeeding that of Alexander the Great, and about the year\r\nof the City of Rome 440, has awarded a very high rank to this tree,\r\nstating that it is related that the raftering of the ancient temples\r\nused to be made of this wood, and that the timber, when employed\r\nin roofs, will last for ever, so to say, being proof against all\r\ndecay,—quite incorruptible, in fact. He also says that there is nothing\r\nmore full of wavy veins[938] than the root of this tree, and that there\r\nis no workmanship in existence more precious than that made of this\r\nmaterial. The finest kind of citrus grows, he says, in the vicinity of\r\nthe Temple of Jupiter Hammon; he states also that it is produced in the\r\nlower part of Cyrenaica. He has made no mention, however, of the tables\r\nthat are made of it; indeed, we have no more ancient accounts of them\r\nthan those of the time of Cicero, from which it would appear that they\r\nare a comparatively recent invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—THE CITRON-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another tree also which has the same name of “citrus,”[939]\r\nand bears a fruit that is held by some persons in particular dislike\r\nfor its smell and remarkable bitterness; while, on the other hand,\r\nthere are some who esteem it very highly. This tree is used as an\r\nornament to houses; it requires, however, no further description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (17.)—THE LOTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica, too, at least that part of it which looks towards our shores,\r\nproduces a remarkable tree, the lotus,[940] by some known as the\r\n“celtis,” which has also been naturalized in Italy,[941] though it\r\nhas been somewhat modified by the change of soil. The finest quality\r\nof lotus is that found in the vicinity of the Syrtes and among the\r\nNasamones. It is the same size as the pear-tree, although Cornelius\r\nNepos states to the effect that it is but short. The leaves have\r\nnumerous incisions, just as with those of the holm-oak. There are many\r\nvarieties of the lotus, which are characterized more particularly by\r\nthe difference in their respective fruits. The fruit is of about the\r\nsize of a bean, and its colour is that of saffron, though before it\r\nis ripe it is continually changing its tints, like the grape. It has\r\nbranches thickly set with leaves, like the myrtle, and not, as with\r\nus in Italy, like the cherry. In the country to which this tree is\r\nindigenous, the fruit of it is so remarkably sweet and luscious, that\r\nit has even given its name to a whole territory, and to a nation[942]\r\nwho, by their singular hospitality, have even seduced strangers who\r\nhave come among them, to lose all remembrance of their native country.\r\nIt is said also, that those who eat this fruit are subject to no\r\nmaladies of the stomach. The fruit which has no stone in the inside\r\nis the best: this stone in the other kind seems to be of an osseous\r\nnature. A wine is also extracted from this fruit very similar to\r\nhonied wine; according to Nepos, however, it will not last above ten\r\ndays; he states also that the berries are chopped up with alica,[943]\r\nand then put away in casks for the table. Indeed, we read that armies\r\nhave been fed upon this food when marching to and fro through the\r\nterritory of Africa. The wood is of a black colour, and is held in high\r\nesteem for making flutes; from the root also they manufacture handles\r\nfor knives, and various other small articles.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of the tree that is so called in Africa; the same\r\nname being also given to a certain[944] herb, and to a stalk[945] that\r\ngrows in Egypt belonging to the marsh plants. This last plant springs\r\nup when the waters of the Nile have retired after its overflow: its\r\nstalk is similar to that of the bean, and its leaves are numerous and\r\ngrow in thick clusters, but are shorter and more slender than those\r\nof the bean. The fruit grows on the head of the plant, and is similar\r\nin appearance to a poppy in its indentations[946] and all its other\r\ncharacteristics; within there are small grains, similar to those of\r\nmillet.[947] The inhabitants lay these heads in large heaps, and there\r\nlet them rot, after which they separate the grain from the residue by\r\nwashing, and then dry it; when this is done they pound it, and then\r\nuse it as flour for making a kind of bread. What is stated in addition\r\nto these particulars, is a very singular[948] fact; it is said that\r\nwhen the sun sets, these poppy-heads shut and cover themselves in the\r\nleaves, and at sun-rise they open again; an alternation which continues\r\nuntil the fruit is perfectly ripe, and the flower, which is white,\r\nfalls off.\r\n\r\n(18.) Even more than this, of the lotus of the Euphrates,[949] it is\r\nsaid that the head and flower of the plant, at nightfall, sink into the\r\nwater, and there remain till midnight, so deep in the water, that on\r\nthrusting in one’s arm, the head cannot be reached: after midnight it\r\ncommences to return upwards, and gradually becomes more and more erect\r\ntill sunrise, when it emerges entirely from the water and opens its\r\nflower; after which it still continues to rise, until at last it is to\r\nbe seen raised quite aloft, high above the level of the water. This\r\nlotus has a root about the size of a quince, enveloped in a black skin,\r\nsimilar to that with which the chesnut is covered. The substance that\r\nlies within this skin is white, and forms very pleasant food, but is\r\nbetter cooked, either in water or upon hot ashes, then in a raw state.\r\nSwine fatten upon nothing better than the peelings of this root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33. (19.)—THE TREES OF CYRENAICA. THE PALIURUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe region of Cyrenaica places before the lotus its paliurus,[950]\r\nwhich is more like a shrub in character, and bears a fruit of a redder\r\ncolour. This fruit contains a nut, the kernel of which is eaten by\r\nitself, and is of a very agreeable flavour. The taste of it is improved\r\nby wine, and, in fact, the juices are thought to be an improvement to\r\nwine. The interior of Africa, as far as the Garamantes and the deserts,\r\nis covered with palms, remarkable for their extraordinary size and\r\nthe lusciousness of their fruit. The most celebrated are those in the\r\nvicinity of the Temple of Jupiter Hammon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—NINE VARIETIES OF THE PUNIC APPLE. BALAUSTIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the vicinity of Carthage is claimed more particularly as its own\r\nby the fruit the name of which is the “Punic apple;”[951] though by\r\nsome it is called “granatum.”[952] This fruit has been distinguished\r\ninto a variety of kinds; the name of “apyrenum”[953] being given to\r\nthe one which has no[954] woody seeds inside, but is naturally whiter\r\nthan the others, the pips being of a more agreeable flavour, and the\r\nmembranes by which they are separated not so bitter. Their conformation\r\nin other respects, which is very similar to the partitions of the\r\ncells in the honeycomb, is much the same in all. Of those that have a\r\nkernel there are five kinds, the sweet, the acrid, the mixed, the acid,\r\nand the vinous: those of Samos and Egypt are distinguished into those\r\nwith red, and those with white foliage.[955] The skin, while the fruit\r\nis yet sour, is held in high esteem for tanning leather. The flower of\r\nthis tree is known by the name of “balaustium,” and is very useful for\r\nmedicinal purposes;[956] also for dyeing cloths a colour which from it\r\nhas derived its name.[957]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35. (20.)—THE TREES OF ASIA AND GREECE; THE EPIPACTIS, THE ERICA,\r\nTHE CNIDIAN GRAIN OR THYMELÆA, PYROSACHNE, CNESTRON, OR CNEORON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Asia and Greece are produced the following shrubs, the\r\nepipactis,[958] by some known as “elleborine,” the leaves of which are\r\nof small size, and when taken in drink, are an antidote against poison;\r\njust in the same way that those of the erica[959] are a specific\r\nagainst the sting of the serpent.\r\n\r\n(21.) Here is also found another shrub, upon which grows the grain of\r\nCnidos,[960] by some known as “linum;” the name of the shrub itself\r\nbeing thymelæa,[961] while others, again, call it “chamelæa”,[962]\r\nothers pyrosachne, others cnestron, and others cneorum; it bears a\r\nstrong resemblance to the wild olive, but has a narrow leaf, which\r\nhas a gummy taste in the mouth. The shrub is of about the size of the\r\nmyrtle; its seed is of the same colour and appearance, but is solely\r\nused for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—THE TRAGION: TRAGACANTHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Crete is the only place that produces the shrub called\r\n“tragion.”[963] It is similar in appearance to the terebinth;[964]\r\na similarity which extends to the seed even, said to be remarkably\r\nefficacious for healing wounds made by arrows. The same island produces\r\ntragacanthe[965] also, with a root which resembles that of the white\r\nthorn; it is very much preferred[966] to that which is grown in Media\r\nor in Achaia; the price at which it sells is three denarii per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—THE TRAGOS OR SCORPIO; THE MYRICA OR BRYA; THE OSTRYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsia, too, produces the tragos[967] or scorpio, a thorny shrub,\r\ndestitute of leaves, with red clusters upon it that are employed\r\nin medicine. Italy produces the myrica, which some persons call\r\nthe “tamarix;”[968] and Achaia, the wild brya,[969] remarkable for\r\nthe circumstance that it is only the cultivated kind that bears a\r\nfruit, not unlike the gall-nut. In Syria and Egypt this plant is very\r\nabundant. It is to the trees of this last country that we give the name\r\nof “unhappy;”[970] but yet those of Greece are more unhappy still,\r\nfor that country produces the tree known as “ostrys,” or, as it is\r\nsometimes called, “ostrya,”[971] a solitary tree that grows about rocks\r\nwashed by the water, and very similar in the bark and branches to the\r\nash. It resembles the pear-tree in its leaves, which, however, are a\r\nlittle longer and thicker, with wrinkled indentations running down the\r\nwhole length of the leaf. The seed of this tree resembles barley in\r\nform and colour. The wood is hard and solid; it is said, that if it is\r\nintroduced into a house, it is productive of painful deliveries and of\r\nshocking deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38. (22.)—THE EUONYMOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no tree productive of a more auspicious presage than one which\r\ngrows in the Isle of Lesbos, and is known by the name of euonymos.[972]\r\nIt bears some resemblance to the pomegranate tree, the leaf being in\r\nsize between the leaf of that and the leaf of the laurel, while in\r\nshape and softness it resembles that of the pomegranate tree: it has\r\na white blossom,[973] by which it immediately gives us notice of its\r\ndangerous properties.[974] It bears a pod[975] very similar to that of\r\nsesame, within which there is a grain of quadrangular shape, of coarse\r\nmake and poisonous to animals. The leaf, too, has the same noxious\r\neffects; sometimes, however, a speedy alvine discharge is found to give\r\nrelief on such occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—THE TREE CALLED EON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Cornelius has called a tree by the name of “eon,”[976] with\r\nthe wood of which, he says, the ship Argo was built. This tree has on\r\nit a mistletoe similar to that of the oak, which is proof against all\r\ninjury from either fire or water, in the same manner, in fact, as that\r\nof no other tree known. This tree, however, appears to have been known\r\nto no other author, that I am aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—THE ANDRACHLE.[977]\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly all the Greek writers interpret the name of the tree called\r\n“andrachle,” as meaning the same as “purslain:”[978] whereas purslain\r\nis, in reality, a herb, and, with the difference of a single letter,\r\nis called “andrachne.” The andrachle is a wild tree, which never grows\r\nin the plain country, and is similar to the arbute tree in appearance,\r\nonly that its leaves are smaller, and never fall off. The bark, too, is\r\nnot rough, but might be taken to be frozen all over, so truly wretched\r\nis its appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41.—THE COCCYGIA; THE APHARCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar, too, in leaf to the preceding tree, is the coccygia,[979]\r\nthough not so large; it has this peculiarity, that it loses its fruit\r\nwhile still in the downy[980] state—they then call it “pappus”—a thing\r\nthat happens to no other tree. The apharce[981] is another tree that is\r\nsimilar to the andrachle, and like it, bears twice in the year: just as\r\nthe grape is beginning to flower the first fruit is ripening, while the\r\nsecond fruit ripens at the commencement of winter; of what nature this\r\nfruit is we do not find stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—THE FERULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe ought to place the ferula[982] also in the number of the exotics,\r\nand as making one of the trees. For, in fact, we distinguish the trees\r\ninto several different kinds: it is the nature of some to have wood\r\nentirely in place of bark, or, in other words, on the outside; while,\r\nin the interior, in place of wood, there is a fungous kind of pith,\r\nlike that of the elder; others, again, are hollow within, like the\r\nreed. The ferula grows in hot countries and in places beyond sea, the\r\nstalk being divided into knotted joints. There are two kinds of it;\r\nthat which grows upwards to a great height the Greeks call by the name\r\nof “narthex,”[983] while the other, which never rises far from the\r\nground, is known as the “narthecya.”[984] From the joints very large\r\nleaves shoot forth, the largest lying nearest to the ground: in other\r\nrespects it has the same nature as the anise, which it resembles also\r\nin its fruit. The wood of no shrub is lighter than this; hence it is\r\nvery easily carried, and the stalks of it make good walking-sticks[985]\r\nfor the aged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—THE THAPSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seed of the ferula has been by some persons called “thapsia;”[986]\r\ndeceived, no doubt, by what is really the fact, that the thapsia is\r\na ferula, but of a peculiar kind, with leaves like those of fennel,\r\nand a hollow stalk not exceeding a walking-stick in length; the seed\r\nis like that of the ferula, and the root of the plant is white. When\r\nan incision is made in the thapsia, a milky juice oozes from it, and,\r\nwhen pounded, it produces a kind of juice; the bark even is never\r\nthrown[987] away. All these parts of the shrub are poisonous, and,\r\nindeed, it is productive of injurious effects to those engaged in\r\ndigging it up; for if the slightest wind should happen to be blowing\r\ntowards them from the shrub, the body begins to swell, and erysipelas\r\nattacks the face: it is for this reason that, before beginning work,\r\nthey anoint the face all over with a solution of wax. Still, however,\r\nthe medical men say that, mixed with other ingredients, it is of\r\nconsiderable use in the treatment of some diseases. It is employed\r\nalso for the cure of scald-head, and for the removal of black and\r\nblue spots upon the skin, as if, indeed, we were really at a loss for\r\nremedies in such cases, without having recourse to things of so deadly\r\na nature. These plants, however, act their part in serving as a pretext\r\nfor the introduction of noxious agents; and so great is the effrontery\r\nnow displayed, that people would absolutely persuade one that poisons\r\nare a requisite adjunct to the practice of the medical art.\r\n\r\nThe thapsia of Africa[988] is the most powerful of all. Some persons\r\nmake an incision in the stalk at harvest-time, and bore holes in the\r\nroot, too, to let the juice flow; after it has become quite dry,\r\nthey take it away. Others, again, pound the leaves, stalk, and root\r\nin a mortar, and after drying the juice in the sun, divide it into\r\nlozenges.[989] Nero Cæsar, at the beginning of his reign, conferred\r\nconsiderable celebrity on this plant. In his nocturnal skirmishes[990]\r\nit so happened that he received several contusions on the face, upon\r\nwhich he anointed it with a mixture composed of thapsia, frankincense,\r\nand wax, and so contrived the next day effectually to give the lie to\r\nall rumours, by appearing with a whole skin.[991] It is a well-known\r\nfact, that fire[992] is kept alight remarkably well in the hollow stalk\r\nof the ferula, and that for this purpose those of Egypt are the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44. (23.)—THE CAPPARIS OR CYNOSBATON, OTHERWISE OPHIOSTAPHYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, too, the capparis[993] is found, a shrub with a wood of\r\nmuch greater solidity. The seed of it is a well-known article of\r\nfood,[994] and is mostly gathered together with the stalk. It is as\r\nwell, however, to be on our guard against the foreign kinds;[995] for\r\nthat of Arabia has certain deleterious properties, that from Africa\r\nis injurious to the gums, and that from Marmarica is prejudicial to\r\nthe womb and causes flatulence in all the organs. That of Apulia, too,\r\nis productive of vomiting, and causes derangement in the stomach and\r\nintestines. Some persons call this shrub “cynosbaton,”[996] others,\r\nagain, “ophiostaphyle.”[997]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—THE SARIPHA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe saripha,[998] too, that grows on the banks of the Nile, is one of\r\nthe shrub genus. It is generally about two cubits in height, and of\r\nthe thickness of one’s thumb: it has the foliage of the papyrus, and\r\nis eaten in a similar manner. The root, in consequence of its extreme\r\nhardness, is used as a substitute for charcoal in forging iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46. (24.)—THE ROYAL THORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must take care, also, not to omit a peculiar shrub that is planted\r\nat Babylon, and only upon a thorny plant there, as it will not live\r\nanywhere else, just in the same manner as the mistletoe will live\r\nnowhere but upon trees. This shrub, however, will only grow upon a kind\r\nof thorn, which is known as the royal thorn.[999] It is a wonderful\r\nfact, but it germinates the very same day that it has been planted.\r\nThis is done at the rising of the Dog-star, after which it speedily\r\ntakes possession of the whole tree. They use it in the preparation of\r\nwine, and it is for this purpose that it is planted. This thorn grows\r\nat Athens also, upon the Long Walls there.[1000]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—THE CYTISUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cytisus[1001] is also a shrub, which, as a food for sheep, has been\r\nextolled with wonderful encomiums by Aristomachus the Athenian, and, in\r\na dry state, for swine as well: the same author, too, pledges his word\r\nthat a jugerum of very middling land, planted with the cytisus, will\r\nproduce an income of two thousand sesterces per annum. It is quite as\r\nuseful as the ervum,[1002] but is apt to satiate more speedily: very\r\nlittle of it is necessary to fatten cattle; to such a degree, indeed,\r\nthat beasts of burden, when fed upon it, will very soon take a dislike\r\nto barley. There is no fodder known, in fact, that is productive of\r\na greater abundance of milk, and of better quality; in the medical\r\ntreatment of cattle in particular, this shrub is found a most excellent\r\nspecific for every kind of malady. Even more than this, the same author\r\nrecommends it, when first dried and then boiled in water, to be given\r\nto nursing women, mixed with wine, in cases where the milk has failed\r\nthem: and he says that, if this is done, the infant will be all the\r\nstronger and taller for it. In a green state, or, if dried, steeped in\r\nwater, he recommends it for fowls. Both Democritus and Aristomachus\r\npromise us also that bees will never fail us so long as they can obtain\r\nthe cytisus for food. There is no crop that we know of, of a similar\r\nnature, that costs a smaller price. It is sown at the same time as\r\nbarley, or, at all events, in the spring, in seed like the leek, or\r\nelse planted in the autumn, and before the winter solstice, in the\r\nstalk. When sown in grain, it ought to be steeped in water, and if\r\nthere should happen to be no rain, it ought to be watered when sown:\r\nwhen the plants are about a cubit in height, they are replanted in\r\ntrenches a foot in depth. It is transplanted at the equinoxes, while\r\nthe shrub is yet tender, and in three years it will arrive at maturity.\r\nIt is cut at the vernal equinox, when the flower is just going off; a\r\nchild or an old woman is able to do this, and their labour may be had\r\nat a trifling rate. It is of a white appearance, and if one would wish\r\nto express briefly what it looks like, it is a trifoliated shrub,[1003]\r\nwith small, narrow leaves. It is always given to animals at intervals\r\nof a couple of days, and in winter, when it is dry, before being given\r\nto them, it is first moistened with water. Ten pounds of cytisus will\r\nsuffice for a horse, and for smaller animals in proportion: if I may\r\nhere mention it by the way, it is found very profitable to sow garlic\r\nand onions between the rows of cytisus.\r\n\r\nThis shrub has been found in the Isle of Cythnus, from whence it has\r\nbeen transplanted to all the Cyclades, and more recently to the cities\r\nof Greece, a fact which has greatly increased the supply of cheese:\r\nconsidering which, I am much surprised that it is so rarely used in\r\nItaly. This shrub is proof, too, against all injuries from heat, from\r\ncold, from hail, and from snow: and, as Hyginus adds, against the\r\ndepredations of the enemy even, the wood[1004] produced being of no\r\nvalue whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48. (25.)—THE TREES AND SHRUBS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. THE PHYCOS,\r\nPRASON, OR ZOSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nShrubs and trees grow in the sea[1005] as well; those of our sea[1006]\r\nare of inferior size, while, on the other hand, the Red Sea and all the\r\nEastern Ocean are filled with dense forests. No other language has any\r\nname for the shrub which is known to the Greeks as the “phycos,”[1007]\r\nsince by the word “alga”[1008] a mere herb is generally understood,\r\nwhile the “phycos” is a complete shrub. This plant has a broad leaf of\r\na green colour, which is by some called “prason,”[1009] and by others\r\nis known as “zoster.”[1010] Another kind,[1011] again, has a hairy\r\nsort of leaf, very similar to fennel, and grows upon rocks, while\r\nthat previously mentioned grows in shoaly spots, not far from the\r\nshore. Both kinds shoot in the spring, and die in autumn.[1012] The\r\nphycos[1013] which grows on the rocks in the neighbourhood of Crete, is\r\nused also for dyeing purple; the best kind being that produced on the\r\nnorth side of the island, which is the case also with sponges of the\r\nvery best quality. A third kind,[1014] again, is similar in appearance\r\nto grass; the root of it is knotted, and so is the stalk, which\r\nresembles that of a reed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—THE SEA BRYON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of marine shrub, known by the name of\r\n“bryon;”[1015] it has the leaf of the lettuce, only that it is of a\r\nmore wrinkled appearance; it grows nearer land, too, than the last.\r\nFar out at sea we find a fir-tree[1016] and an oak,[1017] each a cubit\r\nin height; shells are found adhering to their branches. It is said\r\nthat this sea-oak is used for dyeing wool, and that some of them even\r\nbear acorns[1018] in the sea, a fact which has been ascertained by\r\nshipwrecked persons and divers. There are other marine trees also of\r\nremarkable size, found in the vicinity of Sicyon; the sea-vine,[1019]\r\nindeed, grows everywhere. The sea-fig[1020] is destitute of leaves,\r\nand the bark is red. There is a palm-tree[1021] also in the number of\r\nthe sea-shrubs. Beyond the columns of Hercules there is a sea-shrub\r\nthat grows with the leaf of the leek, and others with those of the\r\ncarrot,[1022] and of thyme. Both of these last, when thrown up by the\r\ntide, are transformed[1023] into pumice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—PLANTS OF THE RED SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the East, it is a very remarkable thing, that immediately after\r\nleaving Coptos, as we pass through the deserts, we find nothing\r\nwhatever growing, with the exception of the thorn that is known as\r\nthe “thirsty”[1024] thorn; and this but very rarely. In the Red Sea,\r\nhowever, there are whole forests found growing, among which more\r\nparticularly there are plants that bear the laurel-berry and the\r\nolive;[1025] when it rains also certain fungi make their appearance,\r\nwhich, as soon as they are touched by the rays of the sun, are turned\r\ninto pumice.[1026] The size of the shrubs is three cubits in height;\r\nand they are all filled with sea-dogs,[1027] to such a degree, that it\r\nis hardly safe to look at them from the ship, for they will frequently\r\nseize hold of the very oars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—PLANTS OF THE INDIAN SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officers[1028] of Alexander who navigated the Indian seas, have\r\nleft an account of a marine tree, the foliage of which is green while\r\nin the water; but the moment it is taken out, it dries and turns to\r\nsalt. They have spoken also of bulrushes[1029] of stone bearing a\r\nstrong resemblance to real ones, which grew along the sea-shore, as\r\nalso certain shrubs[1030] in the main sea, the colour of an ox’s horn,\r\nbranching out in various directions, and red at the tips. These, they\r\nsay, were brittle, and broke like glass when touched, while, on the\r\nother hand, in the fire they would become red-hot like iron, and when\r\ncool resume their original colour.\r\n\r\nIn the same part of the earth also, the tide covers the forests that\r\ngrow on the islands, although the trees there are more lofty[1031]\r\nthan the very tallest of our planes and poplars! The leaves of these\r\ntrees resemble that of the laurel, while the blossom is similar to\r\nthe violet, both in smell and colour: the berries resemble those of\r\nthe olive, and they, too, have an agreeable smell: they appear in the\r\nautumn, and the leaves of the trees never fall off. The smaller ones\r\nare entirely covered by the waves, while the summits of those of larger\r\nsize protrude from the water, and ships are made fast to them; when\r\nthe tide falls the vessels are similarly moored to the roots. We find\r\nthe same persons making mention of certain other trees which they saw\r\nout at sea, which always retained their leaves, and bore a fruit very\r\nsimilar to the lupine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—THE PLANTS OF THE TROGLODYTIC SEA; THE HAIR OF ISIS: THE\r\nCHARITO-BLEPHARON.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuba relates, that about the islands of the Troglodytæ there is\r\na certain shrub found out at sea, which is known as the “hair of\r\nIsis:”[1032] he says that it bears a strong resemblance to coral,\r\nis destitute of leaves, and if cut will change its colour, becoming\r\nquite black and hard, and so brittle as to break if it falls. He\r\nspeaks also of another marine plant, to which he gives the name of\r\n“Charito-blepharon,”[1033] and which, he says, is particularly\r\nefficacious in love-charms.[1034] Bracelets[1035] and necklaces are\r\nmade of it. He says also that it is sensible[1036] when it is about to\r\nbe taken, and that it turns as hard as horn, so hard, indeed, as to\r\nblunt the edge of iron. If, on the other hand, it is cut before it is\r\nsensible of the danger, it is immediately transformed to stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, four\r\nhundred and sixty-eight.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—M.

(1.)—THE NATURE OF THE VINE. ITS MODE OF FRUCTIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose which have been hitherto mentioned, are, nearly all of them,\r\nexotic trees, which it is impossible to rear in any other than\r\ntheir native soil, and which are not to be naturalized in strange\r\ncountries.[1096] It is now for us to speak of the more ordinary kinds,\r\nof all of which Italy may be looked upon as more particularly the\r\nparent.[1097] Those who are well acquainted with the subject, must only\r\nbear in mind that for the present we content ourselves with merely\r\nstating the different varieties of these trees, and not the mode of\r\ncultivating them, although there is no doubt that the characteristics\r\nof a tree depend very considerably upon its cultivation. At this fact\r\nI cannot sufficiently express my astonishment, that of some trees all\r\nmemory has utterly perished, and that the very names of some, of which\r\nwe find various authors making mention, have wholly disappeared.[1098]\r\nAnd yet who does not readily admit that now, when intercommunications\r\nhave been opened between all parts of the world, thanks to the majestic\r\nsway of the Roman empire, civilization and the arts of life have made a\r\nrapid progress, owing to the interchange of commodities and the common\r\nenjoyment by all of the blessings of peace, while at the same time a\r\nmultitude of objects which formerly lay concealed, are now revealed\r\nfor our indiscriminate use?\r\n\r\nStill, by Hercules! at the present day there are none to be found who\r\nhave any acquaintance with much that has been handed down to us by the\r\nancient writers; so much more comprehensive was the diligent research\r\nof our forefathers, or else so much more happily employed was their\r\nindustry. It is a thousand years ago since Hesiod,[1099] at the very\r\ndawn, so to say, of literature, first gave precepts for the guidance\r\nof the agriculturist, an example which has since been followed by no\r\nsmall number of writers. Hence have originated considerable labours\r\nfor ourselves, seeing that we have not only to enquire into the\r\ndiscoveries of modern times, but to ascertain as well what was known to\r\nthe ancients, and this, too, in the very midst of that oblivion which\r\nthe heedlessness of the present day has so greatly tended to generate.\r\nWhat causes then are we to assign for this lethargy, other than those\r\nfeelings which we find actuating the public in general throughout all\r\nthe world? New manners and usages, no doubt, have now come into vogue,\r\nand the minds of men are occupied with subjects of a totally different\r\nnature; the arts of avarice, in fact, are the only ones that are now\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nIn days gone by, the sway and the destinies of states were bounded by\r\ntheir own narrow limits, and consequently the genius of the people was\r\nsimilarly circumscribed as well, through a sort of niggardliness that\r\nwas thus displayed by Fortune: hence it became with them a matter of\r\nabsolute necessity to employ the advantages of the understanding: kings\r\ninnumerable received the homage of the arts, and in making a display\r\nof the extent of their resources, gave the highest rank to those arts,\r\nentertaining the opinion that it was through them that they should\r\nensure immortality. Hence it was that due rewards, and the various\r\nworks of civilization, were displayed in such vast abundance in those\r\ntimes. For these later ages, the enlarged boundaries of the habitable\r\nworld, and the vast extent of our empire, have been a positive injury.\r\nSince the Censor has been chosen for the extent of his property,\r\nsince the judge has been selected according to the magnitude of his\r\nfortune, since it has become the fashion to consider that nothing\r\nreflects a higher merit upon the magistrate and the general than a\r\nlarge estate, since the being destitute of heirs[1100] has begun\r\nto confer upon persons the very highest power and influence, since\r\nlegacy-hunting[1101] has become the most lucrative of all professions,\r\nand since it has been considered that the only real pleasures are those\r\nof possessing, all the true enjoyments of life have been utterly lost\r\nsight of, and all those arts which have derived the name of liberal,\r\nfrom liberty,[1102] that greatest blessing of life, have come to\r\ndeserve the contrary appellation, servility alone being the passport to\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nThis servility each one has his own peculiar way of making most\r\nagreeable, and of putting in practice in reference to others, the\r\nmotives and the hopes of all tending to the one great object, the\r\nacquisition of wealth: indeed, we may everywhere behold men even\r\nof naturally excellent qualities preferring to foster the vicious\r\ninclinations of others rather than cultivate their own talents. We\r\nmay therefore conclude, by Hercules! that pleasure has now begun to\r\nlive, and that life, truly so called, has ceased to be.[1103] As to\r\nourselves, however, we shall continue our researches into matters now\r\nlost in oblivion, nor shall we be deterred from pursuing our task by\r\nthe trivial nature[1104] of some of our details, a consideration which\r\nhas in no way influenced us in our description of the animal world. And\r\nyet we find that Virgil, that most admirable poet, has allowed this\r\nto influence him, in his omission to enlarge upon the beauties of the\r\ngarden; for, happy and graceful poet as he is, he has only culled what\r\nwe may call the flower of his subject: indeed, we find that he has only\r\nnamed[1105] in all some fifteen varieties of the grape, three of the\r\nolive, the same number of the pear, and the citron of Assyria, and has\r\npassed over the rest in silence altogether.\r\n\r\n(2). With what then ought we to begin in preference to the vine, the\r\nsuperiority in which has been so peculiarly conceded to Italy, that\r\nin this one blessing we may pronounce her to have surpassed those of\r\nall other nations of the earth, with the sole exception of those that\r\nbear the various perfumes? and even there, when the vine is in flower,\r\nthere is not a perfume known which in exquisite sweetness can surpass\r\nit. The vine has been justly reckoned[1106] by the ancients among the\r\ntrees, on account of its remarkable size. In the city of Populonium,\r\nwe see a statue of Jupiter formed of the trunk of a single vine, which\r\nhas for ages remained proof against all decay; and at Massilia, there\r\nis a patera made of the same wood. At Metapontum, the temple of Juno\r\nhas long stood supported by pillars formed of the like material; and\r\neven at the present day we ascend to the roof of the temple of Diana at\r\nEphesus, by stairs constructed, it is said, of the trunk of a single\r\nvine, that was brought from Cyprus; the vines of that island often\r\nattaining a most remarkable size. There is not a wood in existence of\r\na more lasting nature than this; I am strongly inclined, however, to\r\nbe of opinion that the material of which these various articles were\r\nconstructed was the wild vine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—THE NATURE OF THE GRAPE, AND THE CULTIVATION OF THE VINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cultivated vine is kept down by pruning every year, and all the\r\nstrength of the tree is drawn as much as possible into the shoots, or\r\nelse thrown downwards to the sets;[1107] indeed, it is only allowed to\r\nexpand with the view of ensuring an abundant supply of juice, a result\r\nwhich is obtained in various modes according to the peculiarities of\r\nthe climate and the nature of the soil. In Campania they attach[1108]\r\nthe vine to the poplar: embracing the tree to which it is thus wedded,\r\nthe vine grasps the branches with its amorous arms, and as it climbs,\r\nholds on with its knotted trunk, till it has reached the very summit;\r\nthe height being sometimes so stupendous that the vintager when hired\r\nis wont to stipulate for his funeral pile and a grave at the owner’s\r\nexpense. The vine keeps continually on the increase, and it is quite\r\nimpossible to separate the two, or rather, I may say, to tear them\r\nasunder. Valerianus Cornelius has regarded it as one of the most\r\nremarkable facts that could be transmitted to posterity, that single\r\nvines have been known to surround villas and country-houses with\r\ntheir shoots and creeping tendrils ever on the stretch. At Rome, in\r\nthe porticoes of Livia, a single vine, with its leaf-clad trellises,\r\nprotects with its shade the walks in the open air; the fruit of it\r\nyields twelve amphoræ of must.[1109]\r\n\r\nEverywhere we find the vine overtopping the elm even, and we read that\r\nCineas,[1110] the ambassador of King Pyrrhus, when admiring the great\r\nheight of the vines at Aricia, wittily making allusion to the peculiar\r\nrough taste of wine, remarked that it was with very good reason that\r\nthey had hung the parent of it on so lofty a gibbet. There is a tree\r\nin that part of Italy which lies beyond the Padus,[1111] known as the\r\n“rumpotinus,”[1112] or sometimes by the name of “opulus,” the broad\r\ncircular[1113] storeys of which are covered with vines, whose branches\r\nwind upwards in a serpentine form to the part where the boughs finally\r\ndivide,[1114] and then, throwing out their tendrils, disperse them in\r\nevery direction among the straight and finger-like twigs which project\r\nfrom the branches. There are vines also, about as tall as a man of\r\nmoderate height, which are supported by props, and, as they throw out\r\ntheir bristling tendrils, form whole vineyards: while others, again, in\r\ntheir inordinate love for climbing, combined with skill on the part of\r\nthe proprietor, will cover even the very centre[1115] of the court-yard\r\nwith their shoots and foliage. So numerous are the varieties of the\r\nvine which even Italy alone presents.\r\n\r\nIn some of the provinces the vine is able to stand of itself without\r\nanything to support it, drawing in its bending branches, and making\r\nup in its thickness for its stunted size. In other places, again,\r\nthe winds will not allow of this mode of culture, as in Africa, for\r\ninstance, and various parts of the province of Gallia Narbonensis.\r\nThese vines, being prevented from growing beyond the first branches,\r\nand hence always retaining a resemblance to those plants which stand\r\nin need of the hoe, trail along the ground just like them, and every\r\nhere and there suck[1116] up the juices from the earth to fill their\r\ngrapes: it is in consequence of this, that in the interior of Africa\r\nthe clusters[1117] are known to exceed the body of an infant in size.\r\nThe wine of no country is more acid than those of Africa, but there is\r\nnowhere to be found a grape that is more agreeable for its firmness,\r\na circumstance which may very probably have given rise to its name of\r\nthe “hard grape.”[1118] As to the varieties of the grape, although they\r\nare rendered innumerable by the size, the colour, and the flavour of\r\nthe berry, they are multiplied even still more by the wines that they\r\nproduce. In one part they are lustrous with a rich purple colour, while\r\nin another, again, they glow with a rosy tint, or else are glossy with\r\ntheir verdant hue. The grapes that are merely white or black are the\r\ncommon sorts. The bumastus[1119] swells out in form like a breast,\r\nwhile that known as the “dactylus,”[1120] has a berry of remarkable\r\nlength. Nature, too, displays such varieties in these productions of\r\nhers, that small grapes are often to be found adhering to the largest\r\nvines, but of surpassing sweetness; they are known by the name of\r\n“leptorragæ.”[1121] Some, again, will keep throughout the winter, if\r\ncare is taken to hang them to the ceiling[1122] with a string; while\r\nothers, again, will keep by virtue of their own natural freshness\r\nand vigour, if put into earthen jars, which are then enclosed in\r\ndolia,[1123] and covered up with the fermenting husks of grapes. Some\r\ngrapes receive from the smoke of the blacksmith’s forge that remarkable\r\nflavour which it is also known to impart to wines: it was the high name\r\nof the Emperor Tiberius that brought into such great repute the grapes\r\nthat had been smoked in the smithies of Africa. Before his time the\r\nhighest rank at table was assigned to the grapes of Rhætia,[1124] and\r\nto those growing in the territory of Verona.\r\n\r\nRaisins of the sun have the name of “passi,” from having been\r\nsubmitted[1125] to the influence of the sun. It is not uncommon to\r\npreserve grapes in must, and so make them drunk with their own juices;\r\nwhile there are some that are all the sweeter for being placed in must\r\nafter it has been boiled; others, again, are left to hang on the parent\r\ntree till a new crop has made its appearance, by which time they have\r\nbecome as clear and as transparent[1126] as glass. Astringent pitch,\r\nif poured upon the footstalk of the grape, will impart to it all that\r\nbody and that firmness which, when placed in dolia or amphoræ, it gives\r\nto wine. More recently, too, there has been discovered a vine which\r\nproduces a fruit that imparts to its wine a strong flavour of pitch:\r\nit is the famous grape that confers such celebrity on the territory of\r\nVienne,[1127] and of which several varieties have recently enriched the\r\nterritories of the Arverni, the Sequani, and the Helvii:[1128] it was\r\nunknown in the time of the poet Virgil, who has now been dead these\r\nninety years.[1129]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these particulars, need I make mention of the fact that\r\nthe vine[1130] has been introduced into the camp and placed in the\r\ncenturion’s hand for the preservation of the supreme authority and\r\ncommand? that this is the high reward which summons the lagging ranks\r\nto the eagles raised aloft,[1131] and that even in chastisement for\r\nfaults it tends to reflect honour upon the punishment?[1132] It was\r\nthe vineyard, too, that first afforded a notion,[1133] the practical\r\nutility of which has been experienced in many a siege. Among the\r\nmedicinal preparations, too, the vine holds so high a place, that\r\nits very wines taken by themselves are efficacious as remedies for\r\ndisease.[1134]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (2.)—NINETY-ONE VARIETIES OF THE VINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocritus, who has declared that he was acquainted with every\r\nvariety of the grape known in Greece, is the only person who has\r\nbeen of opinion that every kind could be enumerated; but, on the\r\nother hand, the rest of the authors have stated that they are quite\r\ninnumerable[1135] and of infinite extent, an assertion the truth of\r\nwhich will be more evident, if we only consider the vast number of\r\nwines. I shall not attempt, then, to speak of every kind of vine, but\r\nonly of those that are the most remarkable, seeing that the varieties\r\nare very nearly as numberless as the districts in which they grow. It\r\nwill suffice, then, to point out those which are the most remarkable\r\namong the vines, or else are peculiar for some wonderful property.\r\n\r\nThe very highest rank is given to the Aminean[1136] grape, on\r\naccount of the body and durability of its wine, which improves with\r\nold age. There are five varieties of the Aminean grape; of these,\r\nthe smaller germana, or “sister” grape, has a smaller berry than\r\nthe rest, and flowers more strongly, being able to bear up against\r\nrain and tempestuous weather; a thing that is not the case with the\r\nlarger germana, though it is less exposed to danger when attached to\r\na tree than when supported only by a trellis. Another kind, again,\r\nhas obtained the name of the “gemella,” or “twin” grape, because\r\nthe clusters always grow[1137] in couples: the flavour of the wine\r\nis extremely rough, but it is remarkable for its strength. Of these\r\nseveral varieties the smaller one suffers from the south wind, but\r\nreceives nutriment from all the others, upon Mount Vesuvius, for\r\ninstance, and the hills of Surrentum: in the other parts of Italy it is\r\nnever grown except attached to trees. The fifth kind is that known as\r\nthe lanata, or “woolly” grape; so that we need not be surprised at the\r\nwool-bearing trees[1138] of the Seres or the Indians, for this grape\r\nis covered with a woolly down of remarkable thickness. It is the first\r\nof the Aminean vines that ripens, but the grape decays with remarkable\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nThe second rank belongs to the vines of Nomentum,[1139] the wood of\r\nwhich is red, from which circumstance the vines have received from some\r\nthe name of “rubellæ.” The grapes of this vine produce less wine than\r\nusual, in consequence of the extraordinary quantity of husk and lees\r\nthey throw off: but the vine is remarkably strong, is well able to\r\nstand the frost, and is apt to receive more detriment from drought than\r\nfrom rain, from heat than from cold; hence it is that those are looked\r\nupon as the best that are grown in cold and moist localities. That\r\nvariety which has the smallest grape is considered the most fruitful:\r\nthe one which has a jagged leaf is less productive.\r\n\r\nThe vine known as the “apiana,”[1140] has received that name from the\r\nbee, an insect which is remarkably fond of it: there are two varieties\r\nof this vine. This grape, too, is covered in its young state with a\r\nkind of down; the main difference between the two varieties is, that\r\nthe one ripens more rapidly than the other, though this last ripens\r\nwith considerable quickness. A cold locality is not at all hurtful to\r\nthem, although there is no grape that ripens sooner: these grapes,\r\nhowever, very soon rot in the rain. The wines produced by this grape\r\nare sweet at first, but contract a rough flavour in the course of\r\nyears. This vine is cultivated more than any other in Etruria. Thus far\r\nwe have made mention of the more celebrated vines among those which are\r\npeculiar and indigenous to Italy; the rest have been introduced from\r\nChios or Thasos.\r\n\r\nThe small Greek[1141] grape is not inferior to the Aminean for the\r\nexcellence of its quality: the berry is remarkably thin-skinned,\r\nand the cluster so extremely small,[1142] that it is not worth\r\nwhile cultivating it, except on a soil of remarkable richness. The\r\neugenia,[1143] so called from its high qualities, has been introduced\r\ninto the Alban territory from the hills of Tauromenium:[1144] it is\r\nfound, however, to thrive only there, for if transplanted elsewhere it\r\ndegenerates immediately: in fact, there is in some vines so strong an\r\nattachment to their native soil, that they leave behind them all their\r\nhigh repute, and are never transplanted in their full entirety. This is\r\nthe case, too, with the Rhætian and the Allobrogian grapes, of which\r\nwe have made mention above as the pitch-flavoured[1145] grape; these\r\nare justly deemed excellent in their own country, while elsewhere\r\nthey are held in no esteem at all. Still, however, in consequence of\r\ntheir remarkable fertility, they make up for quality by abundance: the\r\neugenia thrives in spots which are scorching hot, the Rhætian vine in\r\nplaces of a more moderate temperature, and the Allobrogian in cold,\r\nexposed situations, the fruit being of a black colour, and ripened by\r\nthe agency of frost.\r\n\r\nThe wines produced from the vines of which we have hitherto made\r\nmention, even though the grapes are black, become, all of them, when\r\nold, of a white[1146] complexion. The other vines are of no note in\r\nparticular, though sometimes, thanks to some peculiarity either in\r\nthe climate or the soil, the wines produced from them attain a mature\r\nold age; such, for instance, as the Fecenian[1147] vine, and the\r\nBiturigian,[1148] which blossoms at the same time with it, but has\r\nnot so many grapes. The blossoms of these last-mentioned vines are\r\nnot liable to receive injury, both because they are naturally but\r\ntransitory, and have the power of resisting the action of both wind and\r\nstorm; still, however, those that grow in cold spots are considered\r\nsuperior to those produced in a warm site, and those found in moist\r\nplaces superior to those grown in dry, thirsty localities.\r\n\r\nThe vine known as the “visula”[1149] * * * * more than abundance of\r\nfruit, being unable to endure the extreme variations of the atmosphere,\r\nthough it is very well able to stand a continuation of either cold or\r\nheat. Of this last kind the smaller one is the best, but difficult to\r\nplease in its choice; in a rich earth it is apt to rot, while in a thin\r\nsoil it will come to nothing at all: in its fastidiousness it requires\r\na soil of middling quality, and hence it is that it is so commonly\r\nfound on the hills of the Sabine territory. Its grape is unsightly in\r\nappearance, but has a very pleasant flavour: if it is not gathered at\r\nthe very moment that it is ripe, it will fall, even before it decays.\r\nThe extreme size of the leaves, and its natural hardiness, are its\r\ngreat protection against the disastrous effects of hail.\r\n\r\nThe grapes known as “helvolæ”[1150] are remarkable for the peculiarity\r\nof their colour, which is a sort of midway between purple and black,\r\nbut varies so frequently that it has made some persons give them the\r\nname of “varianæ.” Of the two sorts of helvolæ, the black is the one\r\ngenerally preferred: they both of them produce every other year, but\r\nthe wine is best when the vintage has been less abundant.\r\n\r\nThe vine that is known as the “precia”[1151] is also divided into\r\ntwo varieties, distinguished by the size of the grape. These vines\r\nproduce a vast quantity of wood, and the grape is very good for\r\npreserving in jars;[1152] the leaves are similar in appearance to that\r\nof parsley.[1153] The people of Dyrrhachium hold in high esteem the\r\nvine known as the “basilica,” the same which in Spain is called the\r\n“cocolobis.”[1154] The grapes of this vine grow in thin clusters, and\r\nit can stand great heat, and the south winds. The wine produced from\r\nit is apt to fly to the head:[1155] the produce of the vine is very\r\nlarge. The people in Spain distinguish two kinds of this vine, the one\r\nwith the oblong, the other with the round grape; they gather this fruit\r\nthe very last of all. The sweeter the cocolobis is, the more it is\r\nvalued; but even if it has a rough taste, the wine will become sweet by\r\nkeeping, while, on the other hand, that which was sweet at first, will\r\nacquire a certain roughness; it is in this last state that the wine is\r\nthought to rival that of Alba.[1156] It is said that the juice of this\r\ngrape is remarkably efficacious when drunk as a specific for diseases\r\nof the bladder.\r\n\r\nThe “albuelis”[1157] produces most of its fruit at the top of the\r\ntree, the visula at the bottom; hence, when planted around the same\r\ntree, in consequence of these peculiarities in their nature, they bear\r\nbetween them a two-fold crop. One of the black grape vines has been\r\ncalled the “inerticula,”[1158] though it might with more propriety have\r\nbeen styled the “sobria;”[1159] the wine from it is remarkably good,\r\nand more particularly when old; but though strong, it is productive\r\nof no ill effects, and, indeed, is the only wine that will not cause\r\nintoxication.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of their produce again recommends other vines to us,\r\nand, in the first place, that known as the “helvennaca.”[1160] Of\r\nthis vine there are two kinds; the larger, which is by some called\r\nthe “long” helvennaca, and the smaller kind, which is known as the\r\n“emarcum,”[1161] not so prolific as the first, but producing a wine of\r\nmore agreeable flavour; it is distinguished by its rounded leaf, but\r\nthey are both of them of slender make. It is requisite to place forks\r\nbeneath these vines for the support of their branches, as otherwise\r\nit would be quite impossible for them to support the weight of their\r\nproduce: they receive nutriment from the breezes that blow from the\r\nsea, and foggy weather is injurious to them. There is not one among\r\nthe vines that manifests a greater aversion to Italy, for there it\r\nbecomes comparatively leafless and stunted, and soon decays, while the\r\nwine which it produces there will not keep beyond the summer: no vine,\r\nhowever, thrives better in a poor soil. Græcinus, who has copied from\r\nthe works of Cornelius Celsus, gives it as his opinion that it is not\r\nthat the nature of this vine is repugnant to the climate of Italy, but\r\nthat it is the mode of cultivating it that is wrong, and the anxiety\r\nto force it to put forth its shoots; a mode of treatment, he thinks,\r\nwhich absorbs all its fertility, unless the soil in which it is planted\r\nhappens to be remarkably rich, and by its support prevents it from\r\nbeing exhausted. It is said that this vine is never carbuncled,[1162]\r\na remarkable quality, if, indeed, it really is the fact that there is\r\nany vine in existence that is exempt from the natural influences of the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThe spionia, by some called the “spinea,”[1163] is able to bear heat\r\nvery well, and thrives in the autumn and rainy weather: indeed, it\r\nis the only one among all the vines that does well amid fogs, for\r\nwhich reason it is peculiar to the territory of Ravenna.[1164] The\r\nvenicula[1165] is one of those that blossom the strongest, and its\r\ngrapes are particularly well adapted for preserving in jars. The\r\nCampanians, however, prefer to give it the name of “scircula,” while\r\nothers, again, call it “stacula.” Tarracina has a vine known as the\r\n“numisiana;” it has no qualities of its own, but has characteristics\r\njust according to the nature of the soil in which it is planted: the\r\nwine, however, if kept in the earthen casks[1166] of Surrentum, is\r\nremarkable for its goodness, that is to say, as far south as Vesuvius.\r\nOn arriving in that district, we find the Murgentina,[1167] the very\r\nbest among all those that come from Sicily. Some, indeed, call the\r\nvine “Pompeiana”[1168] and it is more particularly fruitful when grown\r\nin Latium, just as the “horconia”[1169] is productive nowhere but in\r\nCampania. Of a contrary nature is the vine known as the “argeica,”\r\nand by Virgil called “argitis:”[1170] it makes the ground all the\r\nmore[1171] productive, and is remarkably stout in its resistance to\r\nrain and the effects of old age, though it will hardly produce wine\r\nevery year; it is remarkable for the abundant crops which it bears,\r\nthough the grapes are held but in small esteem for eating. The vine\r\nknown as the “metica” lasts well for years, and offers a successful\r\nresistance to all changes of weather; the grape is black, and the wine\r\nassumes a tawny hue when old.\r\n\r\n(3.) The varieties that have been mentioned thus far are those that\r\nare generally known; the others belong to peculiar countries or\r\nindividual localities, or else are of a mixed nature, the produce of\r\ngrafting. Thus the vine known as the “Tudernis,”[1172] is peculiar to\r\nthe districts of Etruria, and so too is the vine that bears the name of\r\n“Florentia.” At Arretium the talpona, the etesiaca, and the consemina,\r\nare particularly excellent.[1173] The talpona,[1174] which is a black\r\ngrape, produces a pale, straw-coloured[1175] must: the etesiaca[1176]\r\nis apt to deceive; the more the wine it produces the better the\r\nquality, but it is a remarkable fact, that just as it has reached that\r\npoint its fecundity ceases altogether. The consemina[1177] bears a\r\nblack grape, but its wine will not keep, though the grape itself is a\r\nmost excellent keeper; it is gathered fifteen days later than any other\r\nkind of grape: this vine is very fruitful, but its grape is only good\r\nfor eating. The leaves of this tree, like those of the wild vine, turn\r\nthe colour of blood just before the fall: the same is the case also\r\nwith some[1178] other varieties, but it is a proof that they are of\r\nvery inferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe irtiola[1179] is a vine peculiar to Umbria and the territories\r\nof Mevania and Picenum, while the pumula[1180] belongs to Amiternum.\r\nIn the same districts we find the vine called bannanica,[1181]\r\nwhich is very deceptive, though the people are remarkably fond of\r\nits fruit. The municipal town of Pompeii has given its name to the\r\nPompeia,[1182] although it is to be found in greater abundance in\r\nthe territory of Clusium. The Tiburina, also, is so called from the\r\nmunicipal town of Tibûr[1183], although it is in this district that\r\nthey have lately discovered the grape known as the “oleaginea,” from\r\nits strong resemblance to an olive: this being the very last kind of\r\ngrape that has been introduced. The Sabines and the Laurentes are the\r\nonly people acquainted with the vinaciola.[1184] As to the vines of\r\nMount Gaurus,[1185] I am aware that, as they have been transplanted\r\nfrom the Falernian territory, they bear the name of “Falernian;” but\r\nit is a fact that the Falernian vine, when transplanted, rapidly\r\ndegenerates. Some persons, too, have made out a Tarentine variety, with\r\na grape of remarkable sweetness: the grapes of the “capnios,”[1186] the\r\n“bucconiatis,”[1187] and the “tarrupia,” grow on the hills of Thurii,\r\nand are never gathered till after the frost commences. Pisæ enjoys the\r\nParian vine, and Mutina the prusinian,[1188] with a black grape, the\r\nwine of which turns pale within four years. It is a very remarkable\r\nthing, but there is a grape here that turns round with the sun, in its\r\ndiurnal motion, a circumstance from which it has received the name of\r\n“streptos.”[1189] In Italy, the Gallic vine is a great favourite,\r\nwhile beyond the Alps that of Picenum[1190] is preferred. Virgil has\r\nmade mention[1191] of the Thasian vine, the Mareotis, the lagea, and\r\nseveral other foreign varieties, which are not to be found in Italy.\r\n\r\nThere are some vines, again, that are remarkable, not for their wine,\r\nbut for their grapes, such, for instance, as the ambrosia,[1192] one\r\nof the “duracinus,”[1193] kind, a grape which requires no potting, but\r\nwill keep perfectly well if left on the vine, so remarkable is the\r\nstrength with which it is endowed for withstanding the effects of cold,\r\nheat, and stormy weather. The “orthampelos,”[1194] too, is a vine that\r\nrequires neither tree nor stay, as it is well able to sustain its own\r\nweight. This, however, is not the case with the “dactylis,”[1195] the\r\nstem of which is no thicker than the finger. The “columbina”[1196] is\r\none of those with the finest clusters, and still more so is the purple\r\n“bimammia;” it does not bear in clusters,[1197] but only secondary\r\nbunches. There is the tripedanea,[1198] too, a name which it owes to\r\nthe length of its clusters, and the scirpula,[1199] with its shrivelled\r\nberry; the Rhætica,[1200] too, so called in the Maritime Alps, though\r\nvery different from the grape of that name which is so highly esteemed,\r\nand of which we have previously spoken; for in this variety the\r\nclusters are small, the grapes lie closely packed, and it produces but\r\na poor wine. It has, however, the thinnest skin of all the grapes, and\r\na single stone,[1201] of very diminutive size, which is known as the\r\n“Chian;”[1202] one or two of the grapes on the cluster are remarkably\r\nlarge. There is also the black Aminean, to which the name of Syriaca is\r\ngiven: the Spanish vine, too, the very best of all those of inferior\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe grapes that are known as escariæ,[1203] are grown on trellises.\r\nOf the duracinus[1204] kind, there are those known as the white and\r\nthe black varieties; the bumastus, too, is similarly distinguished\r\nin colour. Among the vines too, that have not as yet been mentioned,\r\nthere are the Ægian and the Rhodian[1205] kinds, as also the uncialis,\r\nso called, it would seem, from its grape being an ounce in weight.\r\nThere is the picina[1206] too, the blackest[1207] grape known, and\r\nthe stephanitis,[1208] the clusters of which Nature, in a sportive\r\nmood, has arranged in the form of a garland, the leaves being\r\ninterspersed[1209] among the grapes; there are the grapes, too, known\r\nas the “forenses,”[1210] and which quickly come to maturity, recommend\r\nthemselves to the buyer by their good looks, and are easily carried\r\nfrom place to place.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those known as the “cinerea”[1211] are condemned\r\nby their very looks, and so are the rabuscula[1212] and the\r\nasinusca;[1213] the produce of the alopecis,[1214] which resembles in\r\ncolour a fox’s tail, is held in less disesteem. The Alexandrina[1215]\r\nis the name of a vine that grows in the vicinity of Phalacra: it\r\nis of stunted growth, and has branches a cubit in length; the grape\r\nis black, about the size of a bean, with a berry that is soft, and\r\nremarkably small: the clusters hang in a slanting direction, and\r\nare remarkably sweet; the leaves are small and round, without any\r\ndivision.[1216] Within the last seven years there has been introduced\r\nat Alba Helvia,[1217] in the province of Gallia Narbonensis, a vine\r\nwhich blossoms but a single day, and is consequently proof against all\r\naccidents: the name given to it is “Narbonica,” and it is now planted\r\nthroughout the whole of that province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (4.)—REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE CULTURE OF THE VINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elder Cato, who was rendered more particularly illustrious by his\r\ntriumph[1218] and the censorship, and even more so by his literary\r\nfame, and the precepts which he has given to the Roman people upon\r\nevery subject of utility, and the proper methods of cultivation in\r\nparticular; a man who, by the universal confession, was the first\r\nhusbandman of his age and without a rival—has mentioned a few varieties\r\nonly of the vine, the very names of some of which are by this utterly\r\nforgotten.[1219] His statement on this subject deserves our separate\r\nconsideration, and requires to be quoted at length, in order that we\r\nmay make ourselves acquainted with the different varieties of this tree\r\nthat were held in the highest esteem in the year of the City of Rome\r\n600, about the time of the capture of Carthage and Corinth, the period\r\nof his death: it will show too, what great advances civilization has\r\nmade in the last two hundred and thirty years. The following are the\r\nremarks which he has made on the subject of the vine and the grape.\r\n\r\n“Where the site is considered to be most favourable to the growth of\r\nthe vine, and exposed to the warmth of the sun, you will do well to\r\nplant the small[1220] Aminean, as well as the two eugenia,[1221] and\r\nthe smaller helvia.[1222] On the other hand, where the soil is of a\r\ndenser nature or more exposed to fogs, the greater Aminean should be\r\nplanted, or else the Murgentine,[1223] or the Apician of Lucania. The\r\nother varieties of the grape are, for the most part, adapted to any\r\nkind of soil; they are best preserved in a lora.[1224] The best for\r\nkeeping by hanging, are the duracinus kind, the greater Aminean, and\r\nthe Scantian;[1225] these, too, will make excellent raisins for keeping\r\nif dried at the blacksmith’s forge.” There are no precepts in the Latin\r\nlanguage on this subject more ancient than these, so near are we to the\r\nvery commencement of all our practical knowledge! The Aminean grape, of\r\nwhich mention has been made above, is by Varro called the “Scantian.”\r\n\r\nIn our own times we have but few instances of any consummate skill\r\nthat has been manifested in reference to this subject: the less excuse\r\nthen should we have for omitting any particular which may tend to\r\nthrow a light upon the profits that may be derived from the culture\r\nof the vine, a point which on all occasions is regarded as one of\r\nprimary importance. Acilius Sthenelus, a man of plebeian rank, and\r\nthe son of a freedman, acquired very considerable repute from the\r\ncultivation of a vineyard in the territory of Nomentum, not more than\r\nsixty jugera in extent, and which he finally sold for four hundred\r\nthousand sesterces. Vetulenus Ægialus too, a freedman as well, acquired\r\nvery considerable note in the district of Liternum,[1226] in Campania,\r\nand, indeed, received a more extensive share of the public favour,\r\nfrom the fact that he cultivated the spot which had been the place\r\nof exile of Scipio Africanus.[1227] The greatest celebrity of all,\r\nhowever, was that which, by the agency of the same Sthenelus, was\r\naccorded to Rhemmius Palæmon, who was also equally famous as a learned\r\ngrammarian. This person bought, some twenty years ago, an estate at\r\nthe price of six hundred thousand sesterces in the same district of\r\nNomentum, about ten miles distant from the City of Rome. The low\r\nprice of property[1228] in the suburbs, on every side of the City,\r\nis well known; but in that quarter in particular, it had declined\r\nto a most remarkable extent; for the estate which he purchased had\r\nbecome deteriorated by long-continued neglect, in addition to which\r\nit was situate in the very worst part of a by no means favourite\r\nlocality.[1229] Such was the nature of the property of which he thus\r\nundertook the cultivation, not, indeed, with any commendable views or\r\nintentions at first, but merely in that spirit of vanity for which he\r\nwas notorious in so remarkable a degree. The vineyards were all duly\r\ndressed afresh, and hoed, under the superintendence of Sthenelus; the\r\nresult of which was that Palæmon, while thus playing the husbandman,\r\nbrought this estate to such an almost incredible pitch of perfection,\r\nthat at the end of eight years the vintage, as it hung on the trees,\r\nwas knocked down to a purchaser for the sum of four hundred thousand\r\nsesterces; while all the world was running to behold the heaps upon\r\nheaps of grapes to be seen in these vineyards. The neighbours, by way\r\nof finding some excuse for their own indolence, gave all the credit of\r\nthis remarkable success to Palæmon’s profound erudition; and at last\r\nAnnæus Seneca,[1230] who both held the highest rank in the learned\r\nworld, and an amount of power and influence which at last proved too\r\nmuch for him—this same Seneca, who was far from being an admirer of\r\nfrivolity, was seized with such vast admiration of this estate, as not\r\nto feel ashamed at conceding this victory to a man who was otherwise\r\nthe object of his hatred, and who would be sure to make the very most\r\nof it, by giving him four times the original cost for those very\r\nvineyards, and that within ten years from the time that he had taken\r\nthem under his management. This was an example of good husbandry worthy\r\nto be put in practice upon the lands of Cæcuba and of Setia; for since\r\nthen these same lands have many a time produced as much as seven culei\r\nto the jugerum, or in other words, one hundred and forty amphoræ of\r\nmust. That no one, however, may entertain the belief that ancient times\r\nwere surpassed on this occasion, I would remark that the same Cato has\r\nstated in his writings, that the proper return was seven culei to the\r\njugerum: all of them so many instances only tending most convincingly\r\nto prove that the sea, which in our rashness we trespass upon, does\r\nnot make a more bounteous return to the merchant, no, not even the\r\nmerchandize that we seek on the shores of the Red and the Indian Seas,\r\nthan does a well-tilled homestead to the agriculturist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—THE MOST ANCIENT WINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wine of Maronea,[1231] on the coast of Thrace, appears to have been\r\nthe most celebrated in ancient times, as we learn from the writings\r\nof Homer. I dismiss, however, all the fabulous stories and various\r\ntraditions which we find relative to its origin, except, indeed, the\r\none which states that Aristæus,[1232] a native of the same country, was\r\nthe first person that mixed honey[1233] with wine, natural productions,\r\nboth of them, of the highest degree of excellence. Homer[1234] has\r\nstated that the Maronean wine was mixed with water in the proportion\r\nof twenty measures of water to one of wine. The wine that is still\r\nproduced in the same district retains all its former strength, and a\r\ndegree of vigour that is quite insuperable.[1235] Mucianus, who thrice\r\nheld the consulship, and one of our most recent authors, when in that\r\npart of the world was witness himself to the fact, that with one\r\nsextarius of this wine it was the custom to mix no less than eighty\r\nsextarii of water: he states, also, that this wine is black,[1236] has\r\na strong bouquet, and is all the richer for being old.\r\n\r\nThe Pramnian wine, too, which Homer[1237] has also similarly eulogized,\r\nstill retains its ancient fame: it is grown in the territory of Smyrna,\r\nin the vicinity of the shrine of the Mother[1238] of the Gods.\r\n\r\nAmong the other wines now known, we do not find any that enjoyed\r\na high reputation in ancient times. In the year of the consulship\r\nof L. Opimius, when C. Gracchus,[1239] the tribune of the people,\r\nengaging in sedition, was slain, the growth of every wine was of the\r\nvery highest quality. In that year, the weather was remarkable for\r\nits sereneness, and the ripening of the grape, the “coctura,”[1240]\r\nas they call it, was fully effected by the heat of the sun. This\r\nwas in the year of the City 633. There are wines still preserved of\r\nthis year’s growth, nearly two hundred years ago; they have assumed\r\nthe consistency of honey, with a rough taste; for such, in fact, is\r\nthe nature of wines, that, when extremely old, it is impossible to\r\ndrink them in a pure state; and they require to be mixed with water,\r\nas long keeping renders them intolerably bitter.[1241] A very small\r\nquantity of the Opimian wine, mixed with them, will suffice for the\r\nseasoning of other wines. Let us suppose, according to the estimated\r\nvalue of these wines in those days, that the original price of them\r\nwas one hundred sesterces per amphora: if we add to this six per cent.\r\nper annum, a legal and moderate interest, we shall then be able to\r\nascertain what was the exact price of the twelfth part of an amphora\r\nat the beginning of the reign of Caius Cæsar, the son of Germanicus,\r\none hundred and sixty years after that consulship. In relation to this\r\nfact, we have a remarkable instance,[1242] when we call to mind the\r\nlife of Pomponius Secundus, the poet, and the banquet which he gave to\r\nthat prince[1243]—so enormous is the capital that lies buried in our\r\ncellars of wine! Indeed, there is no one thing, the value of which more\r\nsensibly increases up to the twentieth year, or which decreases with\r\ngreater rapidity after that period, supposing that the value of it is\r\nnot by that time greatly enhanced.[1244] Very rarely, indeed, up to the\r\npresent day, has it been known for a single[1245] piece of wine to cost\r\na thousand sesterces, except, indeed, when such a sum may have been\r\npaid in a fit of extravagance and debauchery. The people of Vienne,\r\nit is said, are the only ones who have set a higher price than this\r\nupon their “picata,” wines, the various kinds of which we have already\r\nmentioned;[1246] and this, it is thought, they only do, vying with each\r\nother, and influenced by a sort of national self-esteem. This wine,\r\ndrunk in a cool state, is generally thought to be of a colder[1247]\r\ntemperature than any other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (5.)—THE NATURE OF WINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the property of wine, when drunk, to cause a feeling of warmth in\r\nthe interior of the viscera, and, when poured upon the exterior of the\r\nbody, to be cool and refreshing. It will not be foreign to my purpose\r\non the present occasion to state the advice which Androcydes, a man\r\nfamous for his wisdom, wrote to Alexander the Great, with the view of\r\nputting a check on his intemperance: “When you are about to drink wine,\r\nO king!” said he, “remember that you are about to drink the blood of\r\nthe earth: hemlock is a poison to man, wine a poison[1248] to hemlock.”\r\nAnd if Alexander had only followed this advice, he certainly would not\r\nhave had to answer for slaying his friends[1249] in his drunken fits.\r\nIn fact, we may feel ourselves quite justified in saying that there is\r\nnothing more useful than wine for strengthening the body, while, at the\r\nsame time, there is nothing more pernicious as a luxury, if we are not\r\non our guard against excess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (6.)—FIFTY KINDS OF GENEROUS WINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho can entertain a doubt that some kinds of wine are more agreeable\r\nto the palate than others, or that even out of the very same vat[1250]\r\nthere are occasionally produced wines that are by no means of equal\r\ngoodness, the one being much superior to the other, whether it is\r\nthat it is owing to the cask,[1251] or to some other fortuitous\r\ncircumstance? Let each person, therefore, constitute himself his\r\nown judge as to which kind it is that occupies the pre-eminence.\r\nLivia[1252] Augusta, who lived to her eighty-second year,[1253]\r\nattributed her longevity to the wine of Pucinum,[1254] as she never\r\ndrank any other. This wine is grown near a bay of the Adriatic, not\r\nfar from Mount Timavus, upon a piece of elevated rocky ground, where\r\nthe sea-breeze ripens a few grapes, the produce of which supplies a\r\nfew amphoræ: there is not a wine that is deemed superior to this for\r\nmedicinal purposes. I am strongly of opinion that this is the same\r\nwine, the produce of the Adriatic Gulf, upon which the Greeks have\r\nbestowed such wonderful encomiums, under the name of Prætetianum.\r\n\r\nThe late Emperor Augustus preferred the Setinum to all others, and\r\nnearly all the emperors that have succeeded him have followed his\r\nexample, having learnt from actual experience that there is no danger\r\nof indigestion and flatulence resulting from the use of this liquor:\r\nthis wine is grown in the country[1255] that lies just above Forum\r\nAppii.[1256] In former times the Cæcubum enjoyed the reputation of\r\nbeing the most generous of all the wines; it was grown in some marshy\r\nswamps, planted with poplars, in the vicinity[1257] of the Gulf of\r\nAmyclæ. This vineyard has, however, now disappeared, the result of the\r\ncarelessness of the cultivator, combined with its own limited extent,\r\nand the works on the canal which Nero commenced, in order to provide a\r\nnavigation from Lake Avernus to Ostia.\r\n\r\nThe second rank belonged to the wine of the Falernian territory, of\r\nwhich the Faustianum was the most choice variety; the result of the\r\ncare and skill employed upon its cultivation. This, however, has also\r\ndegenerated very considerably, in consequence of the growers being\r\nmore solicitous about quantity[1258] than quality. The Falernian[1259]\r\nvineyards begin at the bridge of Campania, on the left-hand as you\r\njourney towards the Urbana Colonia of Sylla, which was lately a\r\ntownship of the city of Capua. As to the Faustian vineyards, they\r\nextend about four miles from a village near Cædiciæ,[1260] the same\r\nvillage being six miles from Sinuessa. There is now no wine known that\r\nranks higher than the Falernian; it is the only one, too, among all\r\nthe wines that takes fire on the application of flame.[1261] There are\r\nthree varieties of it—the rough, the sweet, and the thin. Some persons\r\nmake the following distinctions: the Caucinum, they say, grows on the\r\nsummit of this range of hills, the Faustianum on the middle slopes, and\r\nthe Falernum at the foot: the fact, too, should not be omitted, that\r\nnone of the grapes that produce these more famous wines have by any\r\nmeans an agreeable flavour.\r\n\r\nTo the third[1262] rank belonged the various wines of Alba, in the\r\nvicinity of the City, remarkable for their sweetness, and sometimes,\r\nthough rarely, rough[1263] as well: the Surrentine[1264] wines, also,\r\nthe growth of only stayed vines, which are especially recommended\r\nto invalids for their thinness and their wholesomeness. Tiberius\r\nCæsar used to say that the physicians had conspired thus to dignify\r\nthe Surrentinum, which was, in fact, only another name for generous\r\nvinegar; while Caius Cæsar, who succeeded him, gave it the name of\r\n“noble vappa.”[1265] Vying in reputation with these are the Massic\r\nwines, from the spots which look from Mount Gaurus towards Puteoli and\r\nBaiæ.[1266] As to the wines of Stata, in the vicinity of Falernum,\r\nthere is no doubt that they formerly held the very highest rank, a fact\r\nwhich proves very clearly that every district has its own peculiar\r\nepochs, just as all other things have their rise and their decadence.\r\nThe Calenian[1267] wines, too, from the same neighbourhood, used to be\r\npreferred to those last mentioned, as also the Fundanian,[1268] the\r\nproduce of vines grown on stays, or else attached to shrubs. The wines,\r\ntoo, of Veliternum[1269] and Priverna,[1270] which were grown in the\r\nvicinity of the City, used to be highly esteemed. As to that produced\r\nat Signia,[1271] it is by far too rough to be used as a wine, but is\r\nvery useful as an astringent, and is consequently reckoned among the\r\nmedicines for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe fourth rank, at the public banquets, was given by the late Emperor\r\nJulius—he was the first, in fact, that brought them into favour, as we\r\nfind stated in his Letters[1272]—to the Mamertine wines, the produce of\r\nthe country in the vicinity of Messana,[1273] in Sicily. The finest of\r\nthese was the Potulanum,[1274] so called from its original cultivator,\r\nand grown on the spots that lie nearest to the mainland of Italy.\r\nThe Tauromenitanum also, a wine of Sicily, enjoys a high repute, and\r\nflaggons[1275] of it are occasionally passed off for Mamertinum.\r\n\r\nAmong the other wines, we find mentioned upon the Upper Sea those of\r\nPrætutia and Ancona, as also those known as the “Palmensia,”[1276]\r\nnot improbably because the cluster springs from a single shoot.[1277]\r\nIn the interior we find the wines of Cæsena[1278] and that known as\r\nthe Mæcenatian,[1279] while in the territory of Verona there are the\r\nRhætian wines, only inferior, in the estimation of Virgil, to the\r\nFalernian.[1280] Then, too, at the bottom of the Gulf[1281] we find\r\nthe wines of Adria.[1282] On the shores of the Lower Sea there are the\r\nLatiniensian[1283] wines, the Graviscan,[1284] and the Statonian:[1285]\r\nin Etruria, the wines of Luna bear away the palm, and those of\r\nGenua[1286] in Liguria. Massilia, which lies between the Pyrenees and\r\nthe Alps, produces two varieties of wine, one of which is richer and\r\nthicker than the other, and is used for seasoning other wines, being\r\ngenerally known as “succosum.”[1287] The reputation of the wine of\r\nBeterræ[1288] does not extend beyond the Gallic territories;[1289] and\r\nas for the others that are produced in Gallia Narbonensis, nothing can\r\nbe positively stated, for the growers of that country have absolutely\r\nestablished manufactories for the purposes of adulteration, where they\r\ngive a dark hue to their wines by the agency of smoke; I only wish I\r\ncould say, too, that they do not employ various herbs and noxious drugs\r\nfor the same purpose;[1290] indeed, these dealers are even known to\r\nuse aloes for the purpose of heightening the flavour and improving the\r\ncolour of their wines.\r\n\r\nThe regions of Italy that are at a greater distance from the\r\nAusonian Sea, are not without their wines of note, such as those of\r\nTarentum,[1291] Servitia,[1292] and Consentia,[1293] and those, again,\r\nof Tempsa, Babia, and Lucania, among which the wines of Thurii hold\r\nthe pre-eminence. But the most celebrated of all of them, owing to the\r\nfact that Messala[1294] used to drink it, and was indebted to it for\r\nhis excellent health, was the wine of Lagara,[1295] which was grown not\r\nfar from Grumentum.[1296] In Campania, more recently, new growths under\r\nnew names have gained considerable credit, either owing to careful\r\ncultivation, or else to some other fortuitous circumstances: thus, for\r\ninstance, we find four miles from Neapolis the Trebellian,[1297] near\r\nCapua the Cauline,[1298] wine, and the wine of Trebula[1299] grown in\r\nthe territory so called, though but of a common sort: Campania boasts\r\nof all these, as well as of her Trifoline[1300] wines. As to the wines\r\nof Pompeii,[1301] they have arrived at their full perfection in ten\r\nyears, after which they gain nothing by age: they are found also to\r\nbe productive of headache, which often lasts so long as the sixth\r\nhour[1302] of the next day.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations, if I am not greatly mistaken, will go far to prove\r\nthat it is the land and the soil that is of primary importance, and not\r\nthe grape, and that it is quite superfluous to attempt to enumerate all\r\nthe varieties of every kind, seeing that the same vine, transplanted\r\nto several places, is productive of features and characteristics of\r\nquite opposite natures. The vineyards of Laletanum[1303] in Spain[1304]\r\nare remarkable for the abundance of wine they produce, while those of\r\nTarraco[1305] and of Lauron[1306] are esteemed for the choice qualities\r\nof their wines: those, too, of the Balearic Isles[1307] are often put\r\nin comparison with the very choicest growths of Italy.\r\n\r\nI am by no means unaware that most of my readers will be of opinion\r\nthat I have omitted a vast number of wines, seeing that every one has\r\nhis own peculiar choice; so much so, that wherever we go, we hear the\r\nsame story told, to the effect that one of the freedmen of the late\r\nEmperor Augustus, who was remarkable for his judgment and his refined\r\ntaste in wines, while employed in tasting for his master’s table,\r\nmade this observation to the master of the house where the emperor\r\nwas staying, in reference to some wine the growth of that particular\r\ncountry: “The taste of this wine,” said he, “is new to me, and it is\r\nby no means of first-rate quality; the emperor, however, you will see,\r\nwill drink of no other.”[1308] Indeed I have no wish to deny that there\r\nmay be other wines deserving of a very high reputation, but those which\r\nI have already enumerated are the varieties upon the excellence of\r\nwhich the world is at present agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (7.)—THIRTY-EIGHT VARIETIES OF FOREIGN WINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now, in a similar manner, give a description of the varieties\r\nfound in the parts beyond sea. After the wines mentioned by Homer,\r\nand of which we have already spoken,[1309] those held in the highest\r\nesteem were the wines of Thasos and Chios,[1310] and of the latter\r\nmore particularly the sort known as “Arvisium.”[1311] By the side of\r\nthese has been placed the wine of Lesbos,[1312] upon the authority of\r\nErasistratus, a famous physician, who flourished about the year of\r\nthe City of Rome 450. At the present day, the most esteemed of all\r\nis the wine of Clazomenæ,[1313] since they have learned to season\r\nit more sparingly with sea-water. The wine of Lesbos has naturally\r\na taste of sea-water. That from Mount Tmolus[1314] is not so much\r\nesteemed by itself[1315] for its qualities as a wine, as for its\r\npeculiar sweetness. It is on account of this that it is mixed with\r\nother wines, for the purpose of modifying their harsh flavour, by\r\nimparting to them a portion of its own sweetness; while at the same\r\ntime it gives them age, for immediately after the mixture they\r\nappear to be much older than they really are. Next in esteem after\r\nthese are the wines of Sicyon,[1316] Cyprus,[1317] Telmessus,[1318]\r\nTripolis,[1319] Berytus,[1320] Tyre,[1321] and Sebennys; this last is\r\ngrown in Egypt, being the produce of three varieties of grape of the\r\nvery highest quality, known as the Thasian,[1322] the æthalus,[1323]\r\nand the peuce.[1324] Next in rank are the hippodamantian[1325] wine,\r\nthe Mystic,[1326] the cantharite,[1327] the protropum[1328] of\r\nCnidos, the wine of the catacecaumene,[1329] the Petritan,[1330] and\r\nthe Myconian;[1331] as to the Mesogitic,[1332] it has been found to\r\ngive head-ache, while that of Ephesus is far from wholesome, being\r\nseasoned with sea-water and defrutum.[1333] It is said that the wine\r\nof Apamea[1334] is remarkably well adapted for making mulsum,[1335]\r\nlike that of Prætutia in Italy: for this is a quality peculiar to\r\nonly certain kinds of wine, the mixture of two sweet liquids being in\r\ngeneral not attended with good results. The protagion[1336] is quite\r\ngone out of date, a wine which the school of Asclepiades has reckoned\r\nas next in merit to those of Italy. The physician Apollodorus, in the\r\nwork which he wrote recommending King Ptolemy what wines in particular\r\nto drink—for in his time the wines of Italy were not generally\r\nknown—has spoken in high terms of that of Naspercene in Pontus, next\r\nto which he places the Oretic,[1337] and then the Œneatian,[1338] the\r\nLeucadian,[1339] the Ambraciotic,[1340] and the Peparethian,[1341] to\r\nwhich last he gives the preference over all the rest, though he states\r\nthat it enjoyed an inferior reputation, from the fact of its not being\r\nconsidered fit for drinking until it had been kept six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (8.)—SEVEN KINDS OF SALTED WINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far we have treated of wines, the goodness of which is due to\r\nthe country of their growth. In Greece the wine that is known by the\r\nname of “bion,” and which is administered for its curative qualities\r\nin several maladies (as we shall have occasion to remark when we come\r\nto speak on the subject of Medicine[1342]), has been justly held in\r\nthe very highest esteem. This wine is made in the following manner:\r\nthe grapes are plucked before they are quite ripe, and then dried\r\nin a hot sun: for three days they are turned three times a day, and\r\non the fourth day they are pressed, after which the juice is put in\r\ncasks,[1343] and left to acquire age in the heat of the sun.[1344]\r\n\r\nThe people of Cos mix sea-water in large quantities with their wines,\r\nan invention which they first learned from a slave, who adopted this\r\nmethod of supplying the deficiency that had been caused by his thievish\r\npropensities. When this is mixed with white must, the mixture receives\r\nthe name of “leucocoum.”[1345] In other countries again, they follow\r\na similar plan in making a wine called “tethalassomenon.”[1346] They\r\nmake a wine also known as “thalassites,”[1347] by placing vessels full\r\nof must in the sea, a method which quickly imparts to the wine all the\r\nqualities of old age.[1348] In our own country too, Cato has shown the\r\nmethod of making Italian wine into Coan: in addition to the modes of\r\npreparation above stated, he tells us that it must be left exposed four\r\nyears to the heat of the sun, in order to bring it to maturity. The\r\nRhodian[1349] wine is similar to that of Cos, and the Phorinean is of a\r\nstill salter flavour. It is generally thought that all the wines from\r\nbeyond sea arrive at their middle state of maturity in the course of\r\nsix[1350] or seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (9.)—EIGHTEEN VARIETIES OF SWEET WINE. RAISIN-WINE AND\r\nHEPSEMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the luscious wines have but little[1351] aroma: the thinner the\r\nwine the more aroma it has. The colours of wines are four, white,[1352]\r\nbrown,[1353] blood-coloured,[1354] and black.[1355] Psythium[1356]\r\nand melampsythium[1357] are varieties of raisin-wine which have the\r\npeculiar flavour of the grape, and not that of wine. Scybelites[1358]\r\nis a wine grown in Galatia, and Aluntium[1359] is a wine of Sicily,\r\nboth of which have the flavour of mulsum.[1360] As to siræum, by some\r\nknown as “hepsema,” and which in our language is called “sapa,”[1361]\r\nit is a product of art and not of Nature, being prepared from must\r\nboiled down to one-third: when must is boiled down to one-half only, we\r\ngive it the name of “defrutum.” All these mixtures have been devised\r\nfor the adulteration of honey.[1362] As to those varieties which we\r\nhave previously mentioned, their merits depend upon the grape, and the\r\nsoil in which it is grown. Next after the raisin-wine of Crete,[1363]\r\nthose of Cilicia and Africa are held in the highest esteem, both in\r\nItaly as well as the adjoining provinces. It is well known that it is\r\nmade of a grape to which the Greeks have given the name of “stica,”\r\nand which by us is called “apiana:”[1364] it is also made of the\r\nscirpula.[1365] The grapes are left on the vine to dry in the sun, or\r\nelse are boiled in the dolium.[1366] Some persons make this wine of\r\nthe sweet and early white[1367] grape: they leave the grapes to dry in\r\nthe sun, until they have lost pretty nearly half their weight, after\r\nwhich they crush them and subject them to a gentle pressure. They\r\nthen draw off the juice, and add to the pulp that is left an equal\r\nquantity of well-water, the product of which is raisin-wine of second\r\nquality.[1368] The more careful makers not only do this, but take care\r\nalso after drying the grapes to remove the stalks, and then steep the\r\nraisins in wine of good quality until they swell, after which they\r\npress them. This kind of raisin-wine is preferred to all others: with\r\nthe addition of water, they follow the same plan in making the wine of\r\nsecond quality.\r\n\r\nThe liquor to which the Greeks give the name of “aigleucos,”[1369] is\r\nof middle quality, between the sirops and what is properly called wine;\r\nwith us it is called “semper mustum.”[1370] It is only made by using\r\ngreat precaution, and taking care that the must does not ferment;[1371]\r\nsuch being the state of the must in its transformation into wine. To\r\nattain this object, the must is taken from the vat and put into casks,\r\nwhich are immediately plunged into water, and there left to remain\r\nuntil the winter solstice is past, and frosty weather has made its\r\nappearance. There is another kind, again, of natural aigleucos, which\r\nis known in the province of Narbonensis by the name of “dulce,”[1372]\r\nand more particularly in the district of the Vocontii. In order to make\r\nit, they keep the grape hanging on the tree for a considerable time,\r\ntaking care to twist the stalk. Some, again, make an incision in the\r\nbearing shoot, as deep as the pith, while others leave the grapes to\r\ndry on tiles. The only grape, however, that is used in these various\r\nprocesses is that of the vine known as the “helvennaca.”[1373]\r\n\r\nSome persons add to the list of these sweet wines that known as\r\n“diachyton.”[1374] It is made by drying grapes in the sun, and then\r\nplacing them for seven days in a closed place upon hurdles, some seven\r\nfeet from the ground, care being taken to protect them at night from\r\nthe dews: on the eighth day they are trodden out: this method, it is\r\nsaid, produces a liquor of exquisite bouquet and flavour. The liquor\r\nknown as melitites[1375] is also one of the sweet wines: it differs\r\nfrom mulsum, in being made of must; to five congii of rough-flavoured\r\nmust they put one congius of honey, and one cyathus of salt, and\r\nthey are then brought to a gentle boil: this mixture is of a rough\r\nflavour. Among these varieties, I ought to place what is known as\r\n“protropum;”[1376] such being the name given by some to the must\r\nthat runs spontaneously from the grapes before they are trodden out.\r\nDirectly it flows it is put into flaggons, and allowed to ferment;\r\nafter which it is left to ripen for forty days in a summer sun, about\r\nthe rising of the Dog-star.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (10.)—THREE VARIETIES OF SECOND-RATE WINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose cannot properly be termed wines, which by the Greeks are known\r\nunder the name of “deuteria,”[1377] and to which, in common with Cato,\r\nwe in Italy give the name of “lora,”[1378] being made from the husks of\r\ngrapes steeped in water. Still, however, this beverage is reckoned as\r\nmaking one of the “labourers’”[1379] wines. There are three varieties\r\nof it: the first[1380] is made in the following manner:—After the\r\nmust is drawn off, one-tenth of its amount in water is added to the\r\nhusks, which are then left to soak a day and a night, and then are\r\nagain subjected to pressure. A second kind, that which the Greeks are\r\nin the habit of making, is prepared by adding one-third in water of\r\nthe quantity of must that has been drawn off, and after submitting the\r\npulp to pressure, the result is reduced by boiling to one-third of\r\nits original quantity. A third kind, again, is pressed out from the\r\nwine-lees; Cato gives it the name of “fæcatum.”[1381] None of these\r\nbeverages, however, will keep for more than a single year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13. (11.)—AT WHAT PERIOD GENEROUS WINES WERE FIRST COMMONLY MADE\r\nIN ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile treating of these various details, it occurs to me to mention\r\nthat of the eighty different kinds throughout the whole earth, which\r\nmay with propriety be reckoned in the class of generous[1382] wines,\r\nfully two-thirds[1383] are the produce of Italy, which consequently\r\nin this respect far surpasses any other country: and on tracing this\r\nsubject somewhat higher up, the fact suggests itself, that the wines\r\nof Italy have not been in any great favour from an early period, their\r\nhigh repute having only been acquired since the six hundredth year of\r\nthe City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (12.)—THE INSPECTION OF WINE ORDERED BY KING ROMULUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRomulus made libations, not with wine but with milk; a fact which is\r\nfully established by the religious rites which owe their foundation\r\nto him, and are observed even to the present day. The Posthumian\r\nLaw, promulgated by King Numa, has an injunction to the following\r\neffect:—“Sprinkle not the funeral pyre with wine;” a law to which he\r\ngave his sanction, no doubt, in consequence of the remarkable scarcity\r\nof that commodity in those days. By the same law, he also pronounced it\r\nillegal to make a libation to the gods of wine that was the produce of\r\nan unpruned vine, his object being to compel the husbandmen to prune\r\ntheir vines; a duty which they showed themselves reluctant to perform,\r\nin consequence of the danger which attended climbing the trees.[1384]\r\nM. Varro informs us, that Mezentius, the king of Etruria, succoured the\r\nRutuli against the Latini, upon condition that he should receive all\r\nthe wine that was then in the territory of Latium.\r\n\r\n(13.) At Rome it was not lawful for women to drink wine. Among the\r\nvarious anecdotes connected with this subject, we find that the wife\r\nof Egnatius Mecenius[1385] was slain by her husband with a stick,\r\nbecause she had drunk some wine from the vat, and that he was absolved\r\nfrom the murder by Romulus. Fabius Pictor, in his Book of Annals, has\r\nstated that a certain lady, for having opened a purse in which the\r\nkeys of the wine-cellar were kept, was starved to death by her family:\r\nand Cato tells us, that it was the usage for the male relatives to\r\ngive the females a kiss, in order to ascertain whether they smelt of\r\n“temetum;” for it was by that name that wine was then known, whence our\r\nword “temulentia,” signifying drunkenness. Cn. Domitius, the judge,\r\nonce gave it as his opinion, that a certain woman appeared to him to\r\nhave drunk more wine than was requisite for her health, and without the\r\nknowledge of her husband, for which reason he condemned her to lose her\r\ndower. For a very long time there was the greatest economy manifested\r\nat Rome in the use of this article. L. Papirius,[1386] the general,\r\nwho, on one occasion, commanded against the Samnites, when about to\r\nengage, vowed an offering to Jupiter of a small cupfull of wine, if\r\nhe should gain the victory. In fact, among the gifts presented to the\r\ngods, we find mention made of offerings of sextarii of milk, but never\r\nof wine.\r\n\r\nThe same Cato, while on his voyage to Spain, from which he afterwards\r\nreturned triumphant,[1387] would drink of no other wine but that which\r\nwas served out to the rowers—very different, indeed, to the conduct\r\nof those who are in the habit of giving to their guests even inferior\r\nwine[1388] to that which they drink themselves, or else contrive to\r\nsubstitute inferior in the course of the repast.[1389]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—WINES DRUNK BY THE ANCIENT ROMANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wines that were the most esteemed among the ancient Romans were\r\nthose perfumed with myrrh,[1390] as mentioned in the play of Plautus,\r\nentitled the “Persian,”[1391] though we find it there stated that\r\ncalamus[1392] ought to be added to it. Hence it is, that some persons\r\nare of opinion that they were particularly fond of aromatites:[1393]\r\nbut Fabius Dossennus quite decides the question, in the following\r\nline:—“I sent them good wine, myrrh-wine;”[1394] and in his play called\r\n“Acharistio,” we find these words—“Bread and pearled barley, myrrh-wine\r\ntoo.” I find, too, that Scævola and L. Ælius, and Ateius Capito,\r\nwere of the same opinion; and then we read in the play known as the\r\n“Pseudolus:”[1395]—“But if it is requisite for him to draw forth what\r\nis sweet from the place, has he aught of that?” to which Charinus makes\r\nanswer, “Do you ask the question? He has myrrh wine, raisin wine,\r\ndefrutum,[1396] and honey;” from which it would appear that myrrh wine\r\nwas not only reckoned among the wines, but among the sweet wines too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (14.)—SOME REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH WINE-LOFTS. THE\r\nOPIMIAN WINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact of the existence of the Opimian wine gives undoubted proof\r\nthat there were wine-lofts,[1397] and that wine was racked off in\r\nthe year of Rome 633, Italy being already alive to the blessings\r\nshe enjoyed. Still, however, the several varieties that are now so\r\ncelebrated were not so in those days; and hence it is that all the\r\nwines that were grown at that period have only the one general name\r\nof “Opimian” wines, from the then consul Opimius. So, too, for a long\r\ntime afterwards, and, indeed, so late as the times of our grandfathers,\r\nthe wines from beyond sea were held in the highest esteem, even though\r\nFalernian was already known, a fact which we learn from the line of\r\nthe Comic writer,[1398] “I shall draw five cups of Thasian and two of\r\nFalernian.”\r\n\r\nP. Licinius Crassus, and L. Julius Cæsar, who were Censors in the year\r\nfrom the Building of the City 665, issued an edict forbidding the sale\r\nof either Greek or Aminean wine at a higher price than eight asses the\r\nquadrantal[1399]—for such, in fact, are the exact words of the edict.\r\nIndeed, the Greek wines were so highly valued, that not more than a\r\nsingle cup was served to a guest during the repast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—AT WHAT PERIOD FOUR KINDS OF WINE WERE FIRST SERVED AT TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Varro gives us the following statement as to the wines that were\r\nheld in the highest esteem at table in his day: “L. Lucullus, when\r\na boy, never saw an entertainment at his father’s house, however\r\nsumptuous it might be, at which Greek wine was handed round more than\r\nonce during the repast: whereas he himself, when he returned from Asia,\r\ndistributed as a largess among the people more than a hundred thousand\r\ncongiaria[1400] of the same wine. C. Sentius, whom we have seen Prætor,\r\nused to say that Chian wine never entered his house until his physician\r\nprescribed it to him for the cardiac[1401] disease. On the other hand,\r\nHortensius left ten thousand casks of it to his heir.”  Such is the\r\nstatement made by Varro.\r\n\r\n(15.) And besides, is it not a well-known fact that Cæsar, when\r\nDictator, at the banquet given on the occasion of his triumph, allotted\r\nto each table an amphora of Falernian and a cadus of Chian? On the\r\noccasion, too, of his triumph for his victories in Spain, he put before\r\nthe guests both Chian as well as Falernian; and again, at the banquet\r\ngiven on his third consulship,[1402] he gave Falernian, Chian, Lesbian,\r\nand Mamertine; indeed, it is generally agreed that this was the first\r\noccasion on which four different kinds of wine were served at table. It\r\nwas after this, then, that all the other sorts came into such very high\r\nrepute, somewhere about the year of the City 700.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18. (16.)—THE USES OF THE WILD VINE. WHAT JUICES ARE NATURALLY\r\nTHE COLDEST OF ALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not surprised, then, that for these many ages there have been\r\ninvented almost innumerable varieties of artificial wines, of which\r\nI shall now make some mention; they are all of them employed for\r\nmedicinal purposes. We have already stated in a former Book how\r\nomphacium,[1403] which is used for unguents, is made. The liquor known\r\nas “œnanthinum” is made from the wild vine,[1404] two pounds of the\r\nflowers of which are steeped in a cadus of must, and are then changed\r\nat the end of thirty days. In addition to this, the root and the husks\r\nof the grapes are employed in dressing leather. The grapes, too, a\r\nlittle after the blossom has gone off, are singularly efficacious as a\r\nspecific for cooling the feverish heat of the body in certain maladies,\r\nbeing, it is said, of a nature remarkable for extreme coldness. A\r\nportion of these grapes wither away, in consequence of the heat, before\r\nthe rest, which are thence called solstitial[1405] grapes; indeed, the\r\nwhole of them never attain maturity; if one of these grapes, in an\r\nunripe state, is given to a barn-door fowl to eat, it is productive of\r\na dislike to grapes for the future.[1406]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—SIXTY-SIX VARIETIES OF ARTIFICIAL WINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of the artificial wines has wine for its basis; it is called\r\n“adynamon,”[1407] and is made in the following manner. Twenty sextarii\r\nof white must are boiled down with half that quantity of water, until\r\nthe amount of the water is lost by evaporation. Some persons mix with\r\nthe must ten sextarii of sea-water and an equal quantity of rain-water,\r\nand leave the whole to evaporate in the sun for forty days. This\r\nbeverage is given to invalids to whom it is apprehended that wine may\r\nprove injurious.\r\n\r\nThe next kind of artificial wine is that made of the ripe grain of\r\nmillet;[1408] a pound and a quarter of it with the straw is steeped in\r\ntwo congii of must, and the mixture is poured off at the end of six\r\nmonths. We have already stated[1409] how various kinds of wine are made\r\nfrom the tree, the shrub, and the herb, respectively known as the lotus.\r\n\r\nFrom fruit, too, the following wines are made, to the list of which we\r\nshall only add some necessary explanations:—First of all, we find the\r\nfruit of the palm[1410] employed for this purpose by the Parthians\r\nas well as the Indians, and, indeed, throughout all the countries of\r\nthe East. A modius of the kind of ripe date called “chydææ”[1411]\r\nis added to three congii of water, and after being steeped for some\r\ntime, they are subjected to pressure. Sycites[1412] is a preparation\r\nsimilarly made from figs: some persons call it “palmiprimum,”[1413]\r\nothers, again, “catorchites:” if sweetness is not the maker’s object,\r\ninstead of water there is added the same quantity of husk juice[1414]\r\nof grapes. Of the Cyprian fig[1415] a very excellent vinegar, too, is\r\nmade, and of that of Alexandria[1416] a still superior.\r\n\r\nA wine is made, too, of the pods of the Syrian carob,[1417] of pears,\r\nand of all kinds of apples. That known as “rhoites”[1418] is made from\r\npomegranates, and other varieties are prepared from cornels, medlars,\r\nsorb apples, dried mulberries, and pine-nuts[1419] these last are left\r\nto steep in must, and are then pressed; the others produce a sweet\r\nliquor of themselves. We shall have occasion before long to show how\r\nCato[1420] has pointed out the method of making myrtites:[1421] the\r\nGreeks, however, adopt a different method in making it. They first boil\r\ntender sprigs of myrtle with the leaves on in white must, and after\r\npounding them, boil down one pound of the mixture in three congii of\r\nmust, until it is reduced to a couple of congii. The beverage that is\r\nprepared in this manner with the berries of wild myrtle is known as\r\n“myrtidanum;”[1422] it will stain the hands.\r\n\r\nAmong the garden plants we find wines made of the following kinds: the\r\nradish, asparagus, cunila, origanum, parsley-seed, abrotonum,[1423]\r\nwild mint, rue,[1424] catmint,[1425] wild thyme,[1426] and\r\nhorehound.[1427] A couple of handfuls of these ingredients are put\r\ninto a cadus of must, as also one sextarius of sapa,[1428] and half a\r\nsextarius of sea-water. A wine is made of the naphew[1429] turnip by\r\nadding two drachms of naphew to two sextarii of must. A wine is made\r\nalso from the roots of squills.[1430] Among the flowers, that of the\r\nrose furnishes a wine: the leaves are put in a linen cloth and then\r\npounded, after which they are thrown into must with a small weight\r\nattached to make them sink to the bottom, the proportion being forty\r\ndrachms of leaves to twenty sextarii of must; the vessel in which it is\r\nkept must not be opened before the end of three months. A wine, too, is\r\nmade of Gallic nard,[1431] and another kind of the wild[1432] variety\r\nof that plant.\r\n\r\nI find, also, that various kinds of aromatites[1433] are prepared,\r\ndiffering but very little in their mode of composition from that of\r\nthe unguents, being made in the first instance, as I have already\r\nstated,[1434] of myrrh, and then at a later period of Celtic\r\nnard,[1435] calamus, and aspalathus,[1436] of which cakes are made,\r\nand are then thrown into either must or sweet wine. Others, again,\r\nmake these wines of calamus, scented rush,[1437] costus,[1438] Syrian\r\nnard,[1439] amomum,[1440] cassia,[1441] cinnamon, saffron,[1442]\r\npalm-dates, and foal-foot,[1443] all of which are made up into cakes\r\nin a similar manner. Other persons, again, put half a pound of nard\r\nand malobathrum[1444] to two congii of must; and it is in this manner\r\nthat at the present day, with the addition of pepper and honey, the\r\nwines are made by some known as confection wines,[1445] and by others\r\nas peppered[1446] wines. We find mention made of nectarites also, a\r\nbeverage extracted from a herb known to some as “helenion,”[1447] to\r\nothers as “Medica,”[1448] and to others, again, as symphyton,[1449]\r\nIdæa, Orestion, or nectaria, the root of which is added in the\r\nproportion of forty drachms to six sextarii of must, being first\r\nsimilarly placed in a linen cloth.\r\n\r\nAs to other kinds of herbs, we find wormwood wine,[1450] made of Pontic\r\nwormwood in the proportion of one pound to forty sextarii of must,\r\nwhich is then boiled down until it is reduced to one third, or else of\r\nslips of wormwood put in wine. In a similar manner, hyssop wine[1451]\r\nis made of Cilician hyssop,[1452] by adding three ounces of it to two\r\ncongii of must, or else by pounding three ounces of hyssop, and adding\r\nthem to one congius of must. Both of these wines may be made also in\r\nanother method, by sowing these plants around the roots of vines. It\r\nis in this manner, too, that Cato tells us how to make hellebore[1453]\r\nwine from black hellebore; and a similar method is used for making\r\nscammony[1454] wine. The vine has a remarkable propensity[1455] of\r\ncontracting the flavour of any plant that may happen to be growing near\r\nit; and hence it is that in the marshy lands of Patavium, the grape\r\nhas the peculiar flavour of the willow. So, in like manner, we find at\r\nThasos hellebore planted among the vines, or else wild cucumber, or\r\nscammony; the wine that is produced from these vines is known by the\r\nname of “phthorium,” it being productive of abortion.\r\n\r\nWines are made, too, of other herbs, the nature of which will be\r\nmentioned in their respective places, the stœchas[1456] for instance,\r\nthe root of gentian,[1457] tragoriganum,[1458] dittany,[1459]\r\nfoal-foot,[1460] daucus,[1461] elelisphacus,[1462] panax,[1463]\r\nacorus,[1464] conyza,[1465] thyme,[1466] mandragore,[1467] and sweet\r\nrush.[1468] We find the names mentioned, also, of scyzinum,[1469]\r\nitæomelis, and lectisphagites, compounds of which the receipt is now\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe wines that are made from the shrubs are mostly extracted from the\r\ntwo kinds of cedar,[1470] the cypress,[1471] the laurel,[1472] the\r\njuniper,[1473] the terebinth,[1474] and in Gaul the lentisk.[1475] To\r\nmake these wines, they boil either the berries or the new wood of the\r\nshrub in must. They employ, also, the wood of the dwarf olive,[1476]\r\nthe ground-pine,[1477] and the germander[1478] for a similar purpose,\r\nadding at the same time ten drachms of the flower to a congius of must.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20. (17.)—HYDROMELI, OR MELICRATON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a wine also made solely of honey and water.[1479] For this\r\npurpose it is recommended that rain-water[1480] should be kept for a\r\nperiod of five years. Those who shew greater skill, content themselves\r\nwith taking the water just after it has fallen, and boiling it down to\r\none third, to which they then add one third in quantity of old honey,\r\nand keep the mixture exposed to the rays of a hot sun[1481] for forty\r\ndays after the rising of the Dog-star; others, however, rack it off\r\nin the course of ten days, and tightly cork the vessels in which it\r\nis kept. This beverage is known as “hydromeli,” and with age acquires\r\nthe flavour of wine. It is nowhere more highly esteemed than in\r\nPhrygia.[1482]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—OXYMELI.\r\n\r\n\r\nVinegar[1483] even has been mixed with honey; nothing, in fact, has\r\nbeen left untried by man. To this mixture the name of oxymeli has been\r\ngiven; it is compounded of ten pounds of honey, five semi-sextarii of\r\nold vinegar, one pound of sea-salt, and five sextarii of rain-water.\r\nThis is boiled gently till the mixture has bubbled in the pot some\r\nten times,[1484] after which it is drawn off, and kept till it is\r\nold;[1485] all these wines, however, are condemned[1486] by Themison,\r\nan author of high authority. And really, by Hercules! the use of them\r\ndoes appear to be somewhat forced,[1487] unless, indeed, we are ready\r\nto maintain that these aromatic wines are so many compounds taught us\r\nby Nature, as well as those that are manufactured of perfumes, or that\r\nshrubs and plants have been generated only for the purpose of being\r\nswallowed in drink. However, all these particulars, when known, are\r\ncurious and interesting, and show how successfully the human intellect\r\nhas pried into every secret.\r\n\r\nNone of these wines, however, will keep beyond a year,[1488] with the\r\nsole exception of those which we have spoken of as requiring age; many\r\nof these, indeed, there can be no doubt, do not improve after being\r\nkept so little as thirty days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (18.)—TWELVE KINDS OF WINE WITH MIRACULOUS PROPERTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some miraculous properties, too, in certain wines. It is\r\nsaid that in Arcadia there is a wine grown which is productive of\r\nfruitfulness[1489] in women, and of madness in men; while in Achaia,\r\nand more especially in the vicinity of Carynia, there is a wine which\r\ncauses abortion; an effect which is equally produced if a woman in a\r\nstate of pregnancy happens only to eat a grape of the vine from which\r\nit is grown, although in taste it is in no way different from ordinary\r\ngrapes: again, it is confidently asserted that those who drink the\r\nwine of Trœzen never bear children. Thasos, it is said, produces two\r\nvarieties of wine with quite opposite properties. By one kind sleep\r\nis produced,[1490] by the other it is prevented. There is also in the\r\nsame island a vine known as the “theriaca,”[1491] the wine and grapes\r\nof which are a cure for the bites of serpents. The libanian vine[1492]\r\nalso produces a wine with the smell of frankincense, with which they\r\nmake libations to the gods, while, on the other hand, the produce of\r\nthat known as “aspendios,”[1493] is banished from all the altars: it is\r\nsaid, too, that this last vine is never touched by any bird.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians call by the name of “Thasian,”[1494] a certain grape of\r\nthat country, remarkable for its sweetness and its laxative qualities.\r\nOn the other hand, there is in Lycia a certain grape which proves\r\nastringent to the stomach when relaxed. Egypt has a wine, too, known\r\nas “ecbolas,”[1495] which is productive of abortion. There are some\r\nwines, which at the rising of the Dog-star change their nature in the\r\nwine-lofts[1496] where they are kept, and afterwards recover[1497]\r\ntheir original quality. The same is the case, too, with wines when\r\ncarried across the seas: those that are able to withstand the motion of\r\nthe waves, appear afterwards to be twice as old[1498] as they really\r\nare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23. (19.)—WHAT WINES IT IS NOT LAWFUL TO USE IN THE SACRED RITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs religion is the great basis of the ordinary usages of life, I shall\r\nhere remark that it is considered improper to offer libations to the\r\ngods with any wines which are the produce of an unpruned vine, or of\r\none that has been struck by lightning, or near to which a dead man has\r\nbeen hung, or of grapes that have been trodden out by sore feet, or\r\nmade of must from husks that have been cut,[1499] or from grapes that\r\nhave been polluted by the fall of any unclean thing upon them. The\r\nGreek wines are excluded also from the sacred ministrations, because\r\nthey contain a portion of water.\r\n\r\nThe vine itself is sometimes eaten; the tops of the shoots[1500] are\r\ntaken off and boiled, and are then pickled in vinegar[1501] and brine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—HOW MUST IS USUALLY PREPARED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be as well now to make some mention of the methods used in\r\npreparing wines; indeed, several of the Greeks have written separate\r\ntreatises on this subject, and have made a complete art of it, such,\r\nfor instance, as Euphronius, Aristomachus, Commiades, and Hicesius. The\r\npeople of Africa are in the habit of neutralizing such acidity[1502]\r\nas may be found with gypsum, and in some parts with lime. The people\r\nof Greece, on the other hand, impart briskness to their wines when too\r\nflat, with potters’ earth, pounded marble, salt, or sea-water; while\r\nin Italy, again, brown pitch is used for that purpose in some parts,\r\nand it is the universal practice both there as well as in the adjoining\r\nprovinces to season their new wines with resin: sometimes, too, they\r\nseason them with old wine-lees or vinegar.[1503] They make various\r\nmedicaments, also, for this purpose with the must itself. They boil it\r\ndown till it becomes quite sweet, and has lost a considerable portion\r\nof its strength; though thus prepared, they say it will never last\r\nbeyond a single year. In some places they boil down the must till it\r\nbecomes sapa,[1504] and then mix it with their wines for the purpose of\r\nmodifying their harshness. Both for these kinds of wines, as, indeed,\r\nall others, they always employ vessels which have themselves received\r\nan inner coat of pitch; the method of preparing them will be set forth\r\nin a succeeding Book.[1505]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25. (20.)—PITCH AND RESIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the trees from which pitch and resin distil, there are some which\r\ngrow in the East, and others in Europe: the province of Asia,[1506]\r\nwhich lies between the two, has also some of both kinds. In the East,\r\nthe very best commodity of this kind, and of the finest quality, is\r\nthat produced by the terebinth,[1507] and, next to it, that from\r\nthe lentisk,[1508] which is also known as the mastich. The next in\r\nquality to these is the juice of the cypress,[1509] being of a more\r\nacrid flavour than any other. All the above juices are liquid and of\r\na resinous nature only, but that of the cedar[1510] is comparatively\r\nthick, and of a proper consistency for making pitch. The Arabian\r\nresin[1511] is of a pale colour, has an acrid smell, and its fumes are\r\nstifling to those employed in boiling it. That of Judæa is of a harder\r\nnature, and has a stronger smell than that from the terebinth[1512]\r\neven. The Syrian[1513] resin has all the appearance of Attic honey, but\r\nthat of Cyprus is superior to any other; it is the colour of honey, and\r\nis of a soft, fleshy nature. The resin of Colophon[1514] is yellower\r\nthan the other varieties, but when pounded it turns white; it has a\r\nstifling smell, for which reason the perfumers do not employ it. That\r\nprepared in Asia from the produce of the pitch-tree is very white, and\r\nis known by the name of “spagas.”\r\n\r\nAll the resins are soluble in oil;[1515] some persons are of\r\nopinion also that potters’ chalk may be so dissolved:[1516] I feel\r\nashamed[1517] to avow that the principal esteem in which the resins are\r\nheld among us is as depilatories for taking the hair off men’s bodies.\r\n\r\nThe method used for seasoning wines is to sprinkle pitch in the must\r\nduring the first fermentation, which never lasts beyond nine days at\r\nthe most, so that a bouquet is imparted to the wine,[1518] with, in\r\nsome degree, its own peculiar piquancy of flavour. It is generally\r\nconsidered, that this is done most effectually by the use of raw\r\nflower[1519] of resin, which imparts a considerable degree of briskness\r\nto wine: while, on the other hand, it is thought that crapula[1520]\r\nitself, if mixed, tends to mitigate the harshness of the wine and\r\nsubdue its asperity, and when the wine is thin and flat, to give it\r\nadditional strength and body. It is in Liguria more particularly,\r\nand the districts in the vicinity of the Padus, that the utility\r\nis recognized of mixing crapula with the must, in doing which the\r\nfollowing rule is adopted: with wines of a strong and generous nature\r\nthey mix a larger quantity, while with those that are poor and thin\r\nthey use it more sparingly. There are some who would have the wine\r\nseasoned with both crapula and flower of resin at the same time.[1521]\r\nPitch too, when used for this purpose, has much the same properties as\r\nmust when so employed.\r\n\r\nIn some places, the must is subject to a spontaneous fermentation a\r\nsecond time: when this unfortunately happens it loses all its flavour,\r\nand then receives the name of “vappa,”[1522] a word which is applied as\r\nan opprobrious appellation even to worthless men of degenerate spirit:\r\nin vinegar, on the other hand, notwithstanding its tart and acrid\r\ntaste, there are very considerable virtues, and without it we should\r\nmiss many of the comforts[1523] of civilized life.\r\n\r\nIn addition to what we have already stated, the treatment and\r\npreparation of wines are the object of such remarkable attention, that\r\nwe find some persons employing ashes, and others gypsum and other\r\nsubstances of which we have already[1524] spoken, for the purpose of\r\nimproving its condition: the ashes,[1525] however, of the shoots of\r\nvines or of the wood of the quercus, are in general preferred for this\r\npurpose. It is recommended also, to take sea-water far out at sea,\r\nand to keep it in reserve,[1526] to be employed for this purpose: at\r\nall events, it ought to be taken up in the night and during the summer\r\nsolstice, while the north-east wind is blowing; but if taken at the\r\ntime of the vintage, it should be boiled before being used.\r\n\r\nThe pitch most highly esteemed in Italy for preparing vessels for\r\nstoring wine, is that which comes from Bruttium. It is made from the\r\nresin that distils from the pitch-tree; that which is used in Spain\r\nis held in but little esteem, being the produce of the wild pine; it\r\nis bitter, dry, and of a disagreeable smell. While speaking of the\r\nwild trees in a succeeding Book,[1527] we shall make mention of the\r\ndifferent varieties of pitch, and the methods used in preparing it. The\r\ndefects in resin, besides those which[1528] we have already mentioned,\r\nare a certain degree of acridity, or a peculiar smoky flavour, while\r\nthe great fault in pitch is the being over-burnt. The ordinary test of\r\nits goodness is a certain luminous appearance when broken to pieces; it\r\nought to stick, too, to the teeth, with a pleasant, tart flavour.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, the pitch which is most esteemed is that of Mount Ida,\r\nin Greece of Pieria; but Virgil[1529] gives the preference to the\r\nNarycian[1530] pitch. The more careful makers mix with the wine black\r\nmastich, which comes from Pontus,[1531] and resembles bitumen in\r\nappearance, as also iris[1532]-root and oil. As to coating the vessels\r\nwith wax, it has been found that the wine is apt to turn acid:[1533] it\r\nis a better plan to put wine in vessels that have held vinegar, than in\r\nthose which have previously contained sweet wine or mulsum. Cato[1534]\r\nrecommends that wines should be got up—_concinnari_ is his word—by\r\nputting of lie-ashes boiled down with defrutum, one-fortieth part to\r\nthe culeus, or else a pound and a half of salt, with pounded marble as\r\nwell: he makes mention of sulphur also, but only gives the very last\r\nplace to resin. When the fermentation of the wine is coming to an end,\r\nhe recommends the addition of the must to which he gives the name of\r\n“tortivum,”[1535] meaning that which is pressed out the very last of\r\nall. For the purpose of colouring wine we also add certain substances\r\nas a sort of pigment, and these have a tendency to give it a body as\r\nwell. By such poisonous sophistications is this beverage compelled to\r\nsuit our tastes, and then we are surprised that it is injurious in its\r\neffects!\r\n\r\nIt is a proof that wine is beginning to turn bad, if a plate of lead,\r\non being put in it, changes its colour.[1536]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—VINEGAR—LEES OF WINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiarity of wine, among the liquids, to become mouldy, or\r\nelse to turn to vinegar. There are whole volumes which treat of the\r\nvarious methods of preventing this.\r\n\r\nThe lees of wine when dried will take fire and burn without the\r\naddition of fuel: the ashes so produced have very much the nature\r\nof nitre,[1537] and similar virtues; the more so, indeed, the more\r\nunctuous they are to the touch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27. (21.)—WINE-VESSELS—WINE-CELLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various methods of keeping and storing wines in the cellar are very\r\ndifferent. In the vicinity of the Alps, they put their wines in wooden\r\nvessels hooped around;[1538] during their cold winters, they even keep\r\nlighted fires, to protect the wines from the effects of the cold. It is\r\na singular thing to mention, but still it has been occasionally seen,\r\nthat these vessels have burst asunder, and there has stood the wine in\r\nfrozen masses; a miracle almost, as it is not ordinarily the nature of\r\nwine to freeze, cold having only the effect of benumbing it. In more\r\ntemperate climates, they place their wines in dolia,[1539] which they\r\nbury in the earth, either covering them entirely or in part, according\r\nto the temperature. Sometimes, again, they expose their wines in the\r\nopen air, while at others they are placed beneath sheds for protection\r\nfrom the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe following are among the rules given for the proper management of\r\nwines:—One side of the wine-cellar, or, at all events, the windows,\r\nought to face the north-east, or at least due east. All dunghills and\r\nroots of trees, and everything of a repulsive smell, ought to be kept\r\nat as great a distance as possible, wine being very apt to contract\r\nan odour. Fig-trees too, either wild or cultivated, ought not to be\r\nplanted in the vicinity. Intervals should also be left between the\r\nvessels, in order to prevent infection, in case of any of them turning\r\nbad, wine being remarkably apt to become tainted. The shape, too, of\r\nthe vessels is of considerable importance: those that are broad and\r\nbellying[1540] are not so good.[1541] We find it recommended too, to\r\npitch them immediately after the rising of the Dog-star, and then to\r\nwash them either with sea or salt water, after which they should be\r\nsprinkled with the ashes of tree-shoots or else with potters’ earth;\r\nthey ought then to be cleaned out, and perfumed with myrrh, a thing\r\nwhich ought to be frequently done to the wine-cellars as well. Weak,\r\nthin wines should be kept[1542] in dolia sunk in the ground, while\r\nthose in which the stronger ones are kept should be more exposed to\r\nthe air. The vessels ought on no account to be entirely filled, room\r\nbeing left for seasoning, by mixing either raisin wine or else defrutum\r\nflavoured with saffron; old pitch and sapa are sometimes used for the\r\nsame purpose. The lids, too, of the dolia ought to be seasoned in a\r\nsimilar manner, with the addition of mastich and Bruttian pitch.\r\n\r\nIt is strongly recommended never to open the vessels, except in fine\r\nweather; nor yet while a south wind is blowing, or at a full moon.\r\n\r\nThe flower[1543] of wine when white is looked upon as a good sign;\r\nbut when it is red, it is bad, unless that should happen to be the\r\ncolour of the wine. The vessels, too, should not be hot to the touch,\r\nnor should the covers throw out a sort of sweat. When wine very soon\r\nflowers on the surface and emits an odour, it is a sign that it will\r\nnot keep.\r\n\r\nAs to defrutum and sapa, it is recommended to commence boiling\r\nthem when there is no moon to be seen, or, in other words, at the\r\nconjunction of that planet, and at no other time. Leaden[1544] vessels\r\nshould be used for this purpose, and not copper[1545] ones, and walnuts\r\nare generally thrown into them, from a notion that they absorb[1546]\r\nthe smoke. In Campania they expose the very finest wines in casks in\r\nthe open air, it being the opinion that it tends to improve the wine if\r\nit is exposed to the action of the sun and moon, the rain and the winds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28. (22.)—DRUNKENNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one will take the trouble duly to consider the matter, he\r\nwill find that upon no one subject is the industry of man kept more\r\nconstantly on the alert than upon the making of wine; as if Nature had\r\nnot given us water as a beverage, the one, in fact, of which all other\r\nanimals make use. We, on the other hand, even go so far as to make our\r\nvery beasts of burden drink[1547] wine: so vast are our efforts, so\r\nvast our labours, and so boundless the cost which we thus lavish upon\r\na liquid which deprives man of his reason and drives him to frenzy and\r\nto the commission of a thousand crimes! So great, however, are its\r\nattractions, that a great part of mankind are of opinion that there\r\nis nothing else in life worth living for. Nay, what is even more than\r\nthis, that we may be enabled to swallow all the more, we have adopted\r\nthe plan of diminishing its strength by pressing it through[1548]\r\nfilters of cloth, and have devised numerous inventions whereby to\r\ncreate an artificial thirst. To promote drinking, we find that even\r\npoisonous mixtures have been invented, and some men are known to take a\r\ndose of hemlock before they begin to drink, that they may have the fear\r\nof death before them to make them take their wine:[1549] others, again,\r\ntake powdered pumice[1550] for the same purpose, and various other\r\nmixtures, which I should feel quite ashamed any further to enlarge upon.\r\n\r\nWe see the more prudent among those who are given to this habit have\r\nthemselves parboiled in hot-baths, from whence they are carried away\r\nhalf dead. Others there are, again, who cannot wait till they have\r\ngot to the banqueting couch,[1551] no, not so much as till they have\r\ngot their shirt on,[1552] but all naked and panting as they are, the\r\ninstant they leave the bath they seize hold of large vessels filled\r\nwith wine, to show off, as it were, their mighty powers, and so gulp\r\ndown the whole of the contents only to vomit them up again the very\r\nnext moment. This they will repeat, too, a second and even a third\r\ntime, just as though they had only been begotten for the purpose of\r\nwasting wine, and as if that liquor could not be thrown away without\r\nhaving first passed through the human body. It is to encourage habits\r\nsuch as these that we have introduced the athletic exercises[1553] of\r\nother countries, such as rolling in the mud, for instance, and throwing\r\nthe arms back to show off a brawny neck and chest. Of all these\r\nexercises, thirst, it is said, is the chief and primary object.\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, what vessels are employed for holding wine! carved\r\nall over with the representations of adulterous intrigues, as if, in\r\nfact, drunkenness itself was not sufficiently capable of teaching us\r\nlessons of lustfulness. Thus we see wines quaffed out of impurities,\r\nand inebriety invited even by the hope of a reward,—invited, did I\r\nsay?—may the gods forgive me for saying so, purchased outright. We\r\nfind one person induced to drink upon the condition that he shall have\r\nas much to eat as he has previously drunk, while another has to quaff\r\nas many cups as he has thrown points on the dice. Then it is that the\r\nroving, insatiate eyes are setting a price upon the matron’s chastity;\r\nand yet, heavy as they are with wine, they do not fail to betray their\r\ndesigns to her husband. Then it is that all the secrets of the mind\r\nare revealed; one man is heard to disclose the provisions of his will,\r\nanother lets fall some expression of fatal import, and so fails to keep\r\nto himself words which will be sure to come home to him with a cut\r\nthroat. And how many a man has met his death in this fashion! Indeed,\r\nit has become quite a common proverb, that “in wine[1554] there is\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\nShould he, however, fortunately escape all these dangers, the drunkard\r\nnever beholds the rising sun, by which his life of drinking is made\r\nall the shorter. From wine, too, comes that pallid hue,[1555] those\r\ndrooping eyelids, those sore eyes, those tremulous hands, unable to\r\nhold with steadiness the overflowing vessel, condign punishment in the\r\nshape of sleep agitated by Furies during the restless night, and, the\r\nsupreme reward of inebriety, those dreams of monstrous lustfulness and\r\nof forbidden delights. Then on the next day there is the breath reeking\r\nof the wine-cask, and a nearly total obliviousness of everything, from\r\nthe annihilation of the powers of the memory. And this, too, is what\r\nthey call “seizing the moments of life!”[1556] whereas, in reality,\r\nwhile other men lose the day that has gone before, the drinker has\r\nalready lost the one that is to come.\r\n\r\nThey first began, in the reign of Tiberius Claudius, some forty years\r\nago, to drink fasting, and to take whets of wine before meals; an\r\noutlandish[1557] fashion, however, and only patronized by physicians\r\nwho wished to recommend themselves by the introduction of some novelty\r\nor other.\r\n\r\nIt is in the exercise of their drinking powers that the Parthians look\r\nfor their share of fame, and it was in this that Alcibiades among\r\nthe Greeks earned his great repute. Among ourselves, too, Novellius\r\nTorquatus of Mediolanum, a man who held all the honours of the state\r\nfrom the prefecture to the pro-consulate, could drink off three\r\ncongii[1558] at a single draught, a feat from which he obtained the\r\nsurname of “Tricongius:” this he did before the eyes of the Emperor\r\nTiberius, and to his extreme surprise and astonishment, a man who in\r\nhis old age was very morose,[1559] and indeed very cruel in general;\r\nthough in his younger days he himself had been too much addicted to\r\nwine. Indeed it was owing to that recommendation that it was generally\r\nthought that L. Piso was selected by him to have the charge and\r\ncustody[1560] of the City of Rome; he having kept up a drinking-bout at\r\nthe residence of Tiberius, just after he had become emperor, two days\r\nand two nights without intermission. In no point, too, was it generally\r\nsaid that Drusus Cæsar took after his father Tiberius more than\r\nthis.[1561] Torquatus had the rather uncommon glory—for this science,\r\ntoo, is regulated by peculiar laws of its own—of never being known to\r\nstammer in his speech, or to relieve the stomach by vomiting or urine,\r\nwhile engaged in drinking. He was always on duty at the morning guard,\r\nwas able to empty the largest vessel at a single draught, and yet to\r\ntake more ordinary cups in addition than any one else; he was always\r\nto be implicitly depended upon, too, for being able to drink without\r\ntaking breath and without ever spitting, or so much as leaving enough\r\nat the bottom of the cup to make a plash upon the pavement;[1562] thus\r\nshowing himself an exact observer of the regulations which have been\r\nmade to prevent all shirking on the part of drinkers.\r\n\r\nTergilla reproaches Cicero, the son of Marcus Cicero, with being\r\nin the habit of taking off a couple of congii at a single draught,\r\nand with having thrown a cup, when in a state of drunkenness, at\r\nM. Agrippa;[1563] such, in fact, being the ordinary results of\r\nintoxication. But it is not to be wondered at that Cicero was desirous\r\nin this respect to eclipse the fame of M. Antonius, the murderer of his\r\nfather; a man who had, before the time of the younger Cicero, shown\r\nhimself so extremely anxious to maintain the superiority in this kind\r\nof qualification, that he had even gone so far as to publish a book\r\nupon the subject of his own drunkenness.[1564] Daring in this work\r\nto speak in his own defence, he has proved very satisfactorily, to\r\nmy thinking, how many were the evils he had inflicted upon the world\r\nthrough this same vice of drunkenness. It was but a short time before\r\nthe battle of Actium that he vomited forth this book of his, from\r\nwhich we have no great difficulty in coming to the conclusion, that\r\ndrunk as he already was with the blood of his fellow-citizens, the only\r\nresult was that he thirsted for it all the more. For, in fact, such is\r\nthe infallible characteristic of drunkenness, the more a person is in\r\nthe habit of drinking, the more eager he is for drink; and the remark\r\nof the Scythian ambassador is as true as it is well known—the more the\r\nParthians drank, the thirstier they were for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—LIQUORS WITH THE STRENGTH OF WINE MADE FROM WATER AND CORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of the Western world have also their intoxicating drinks,\r\nmade from corn steeped in water.[1565] These beverages are prepared\r\nin different ways throughout Gaul and the provinces of Spain; under\r\ndifferent names, too, though in their results they are the same. The\r\nSpanish provinces have even taught us the fact that these liquors are\r\ncapable of being kept till they have attained a considerable age.\r\nEgypt,[1566] too, has invented for its use a very similar beverage\r\nmade from corn; indeed, in no part of the world is drunkenness ever\r\nat a loss. And then, besides, they take these drinks unmixed, and do\r\nnot dilute them with water, the way that wine is modified; and yet, by\r\nHercules! one really might have supposed that there the earth produced\r\nnothing but corn for the people’s use. Alas! what wondrous skill, and\r\nyet how misplaced! means have absolutely been discovered for getting\r\ndrunk upon water even.\r\n\r\nThere are two liquids that are peculiarly grateful to the human body,\r\nwine within and oil without; both of them the produce of trees, and\r\nmost excellent in their respective kinds. Oil, indeed, we may pronounce\r\nan absolute necessary, nor has mankind been slow to employ all the\r\narts of invention in the manufacture of it. How much more ingenious,\r\nhowever, man has shown himself in devising various kinds of drink will\r\nbe evident from the fact, that there are no less than one hundred and\r\nninety-five different kinds of it; indeed, if all the varieties are\r\nreckoned, they will amount to nearly double that number. The various\r\nkinds of oil are much less numerous—we shall proceed to give an account\r\nof them in the following Book.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, five\r\nhundred and ten.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Cornelius Valerianus,[1567] Virgil,[1568]\r\nCelsus,[1569] Cato the Censor,[1570] Saserna,[1571] father and son,\r\nScrofa,[1572] M.

(1.)—THE OLIVE.—HOW LONG IT EXISTED ONLY IN GREECE. AT WHAT\r\nPERIOD IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED INTO ITALY, SPAIN, AND AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheophrastus,[1631] one of the most famous among the Greek writers, who\r\nflourished about the year 440 of the City of Rome, has asserted that\r\nthe olive[1632] does not grow at a distance of more than forty[1633]\r\nmiles from the sea. Fenestella tells us that in the year of Rome 173,\r\nbeing the reign of Tarquinius Priscus, it did not exist in Italy,\r\nSpain, or Africa;[1634] whereas at the present day it has crossed the\r\nAlps even, and has been introduced into the two provinces of Gaul\r\nand the middle of Spain. In the year of Rome 505, Appius Claudius,\r\ngrandson of Appius Claudius Cæcus, and L. Junius being consuls, twelve\r\npounds of oil sold for an as; and at a later period, in the year 680,\r\nM. Seius, son of Lucius, the curule ædile, regulated the price of\r\nolive oil at Rome, at the rate of ten pounds for the as, for the whole\r\nyear. A person will be the less surprised at this, when he learns that\r\ntwenty-two years after, in the third consulship of Cn. Pompeius, Italy\r\nwas able to export olive oil to the provinces.\r\n\r\nHesiod,[1635] who looked upon an acquaintance with agriculture as\r\nconducive in the very highest degree to the comforts of life, has\r\ndeclared that there was no one who had ever gathered fruit from the\r\nolive-tree that had been sown by his own hands, so slow was it in\r\nreaching maturity in those times; whereas, now at the present day, it\r\nis sown in nurseries even, and if transplanted will bear fruit the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—THE NATURE OF THE OLIVE, AND OF NEW OLIVE OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFabianus maintains that the olive will grow[1636] neither in very cold\r\nclimates, nor yet in very hot ones. Virgil[1637] has mentioned three\r\nvarieties of the olive, the orchites,[1638] the radius,[1639] and the\r\nposia;[1640] and says that they require no raking or pruning, nor, in\r\nfact, any attention whatever. There is no doubt that in the case of\r\nthese plants, soil and climate are the things of primary importance;\r\nbut still, it is usual to prune them at the same time as the vine,\r\nand they are improved by lopping between them every here and there.\r\nThe gathering of the olive follows that of the grape, and there is\r\neven a greater degree of skill required in preparing[1641] oil than\r\nin making wine; for the very same olives will frequently give quite\r\ndifferent results. The first oil of all, produced from the raw[1642]\r\nolive before it has begun to ripen, is considered preferable to all\r\nthe others in flavour; in this kind, too, the first[1643] droppings\r\nof the press are the most esteemed, diminishing gradually in goodness\r\nand value; and this, whether the wicker-work[1644] basket is used in\r\nmaking it, or whether, following the more recent plan, the pulp is\r\nput in a stick strainer, with narrow spikes and interstices.[1645] The\r\nriper the berry, the more unctuous the juice, and the less agreeable\r\nthe taste.[1646] To obtain a result both abundant and of excellent\r\nflavour, the best time to gather it is when the berry is just on the\r\npoint of turning black. In this state it is called “druppa” by us, by\r\nthe Greeks, “drypetis.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to these distinctions, it is of importance to observe\r\nwhether the berry ripens in the press or while on the branch; whether\r\nthe tree has been watered, or whether the fruit has been nurtured\r\nsolely by its own juices, and has imbibed nothing else but the dews of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (2.)—OLIVE OIL: THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT IS PRODUCED, AND ITS\r\nVARIOUS QUALITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not with olive oil as it is with wine, for by age it acquires a\r\nbad flavour,[1647] and at the end of a year it is already old. This, if\r\nrightly understood, is a wise provision on the part of Nature: wine,\r\nwhich is only produced for the drunkard, she has seen no necessity for\r\nus to use when new; indeed, by the fine flavour which it acquires with\r\nage, she rather invites us to keep it; but, on the other hand, she has\r\nnot willed that we should be thus sparing of oil, and so has rendered\r\nits use common and universal by the very necessity there is of using it\r\nwhile fresh.\r\n\r\nIn the production of this blessing as well,[1648] Italy holds the\r\nhighest rank among all countries,[1649] and more particularly the\r\nterritory of Venafrum,[1650] that part of it in especial which produces\r\nthe Licinian oil; the qualities of which have conferred upon the\r\nLicinian olive the very highest renown. It is our unguents which have\r\nbrought this oil into such great esteem, the peculiar odour of it\r\nadapting itself so well to the full development of their qualities; at\r\nthe same time its delicate flavour equally enlists the palate in its\r\nbehalf. In addition to this, birds will never touch the berry of the\r\nLicinian olive.\r\n\r\nNext to Italy, the contest is maintained, and on very equal terms,\r\nbetween the territories of Istria and of Bætica. The next rank for\r\nexcellence is claimed by the other provinces of our Empire, with the\r\nexception of Africa,[1651] the soil of which is better adapted for\r\ngrain. That country Nature has given exclusively to the cereals; of oil\r\nand wine she has all but deprived it, securing it a sufficient share\r\nof renown by its abundant harvests. As to the remaining particulars\r\nconnected with the olive, they are replete with erroneous notions, and\r\nI shall have occasion to show that there is no part of our agricultural\r\neconomy upon which people have been more generally mistaken.\r\n\r\n(3.) The olive is composed of a stone, oil, flesh, and amurca:[1652]\r\nthe last being a bitter liquid, principally composed of water; hence it\r\nis that in seasons of drought it is less plentiful, and more abundant\r\nwhen rains[1653] have prevailed. The oil is a juice peculiar to the\r\nolive, a fact more particularly stated in reference to its unripe\r\nstate, as we have already mentioned when speaking of omphacium.[1654]\r\nThis oil continues on the increase up to the rising of Arcturus,[1655]\r\nor in other words, the sixteenth day before the calends of\r\nOctober;[1656] after which the increase is in the stone and the flesh.\r\nWhen drought has been followed by abundant rains, the oil is spoilt,\r\nand turns to amurca. It is the colour of this amurca that makes the\r\nolive turn black; hence, when the berry is just beginning to turn that\r\ncolour, there is but little amurca in it, and before that period none\r\nat all. It is an error then, on the part of persons, to suppose that\r\nthat is the commencement of maturity, which is in reality only the\r\nnear approach of corruption. A second error, too, is the supposition\r\nthat the oil increases proportionally to the flesh of the berry, it\r\nbeing the fact that the oil is all the time undergoing a change into\r\nflesh, and the stone is growing larger and larger within. It is for\r\nthis reason more particularly, that care is taken to water the tree\r\nat this period; the real result of all this care and attention, as\r\nwell as of the fall of copious rains, being, that the oil in reality\r\nis absorbed as the berry increases in size, unless fine dry weather\r\nshould happen to set in, which naturally tends to contract the volume\r\nof the fruit. According to Theophrastus,[1657] heat is the sole primary\r\ncause of the oleaginous principle; for which reason it is, that in the\r\npresses,[1658] and in the cellars even, great fires are lighted to\r\nimprove the quality of the oil.\r\n\r\nA third error arises from misplaced economy: to spare the expense of\r\ngathering, people are in the habit of waiting till the berry falls\r\nfrom the tree. Others, again, who wish to follow a middle course in\r\nthis respect, beat the fruit off with poles, and so inflict injury on\r\nthe tree and ensure loss in the succeeding year; indeed, there was a\r\nvery ancient regulation in existence relative to the gathering of the\r\nolive—“Neither pull nor beat the olive-tree.”[1659] Those who would\r\nobserve a still greater degree of precaution, strike the branches\r\nlightly with a reed on one side of them; but even then the tree is\r\nreduced to bearing fruit but once in two years,[1660] in consequence\r\nof the injury done to the buds. Not less injurious, however, are\r\nthe results of waiting till the berries fall from the tree; for, by\r\nremaining on it beyond the proper time, they deprive the crop that is\r\ncoming on of its due share of nutriment, by occupying its place: a\r\nclear proof of which is, that if they are not gathered before the west\r\nwinds prevail, they are found to have acquired renewed strength, and\r\nare all the later before they fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—FIFTEEN VARIETIES OF OLIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first olive that is gathered after the autumn is that known as\r\nthe “posia,”[1661] the berry of which, owing to a vicious method of\r\ncultivation, and not any fault on the part of Nature, has the most\r\nflesh upon it. Next to this is the orchites, which contains the\r\ngreatest quantity of oil, and then, after that, the radius. As these\r\nare of a peculiarly delicate nature, the heat very rapidly takes\r\neffect upon them, and the amurca they contain causes them to fall. On\r\nthe other hand, the gathering of the tough, hard-skinned olive is put\r\noff so late as the month of March, it being well able to resist the\r\neffects of moisture, and, consequently, very small. Those varieties\r\nknown as the Licinian, the Cominian, the Contian, and the Sergian,\r\nby the Sabines called the “royal”[1662] olive, do not turn black\r\nbefore the west winds prevail, or, in other words, before the sixth\r\nday before[1663] the ides of February. At this period it is generally\r\nthought that they begin to ripen, and as a most excellent oil is\r\nextracted from them, experience would seem to give its support to a\r\ntheory which, in reality, is altogether wrong. The growers say that in\r\nthe same degree that cold diminishes the oil, the ripeness of the berry\r\naugments it; whereas, in reality, the goodness of the oil is owing,\r\nnot to the period at which the olives are gathered, but to the natural\r\nproperties of this peculiar variety, in which the oil is remarkably\r\nslow in turning to amurca.\r\n\r\nA similar error, too, is committed by those who keep the olives, when\r\ngathered, upon a layer of boards, and do not press the fruit till it\r\nhas thrown out a sweat; it being the fact that every hour lost tends\r\nto diminish the oil and increase the amurca: the consequence is, that,\r\naccording to the ordinary computation, a modius of olives yields no\r\nmore than six pounds of oil. No one, however, ever takes account of\r\nthe quantity of amurca to ascertain, in reference to the same kind of\r\nberry, to what extent it increases daily in amount. Then, again, it is\r\na very general error[1664] among practical persons to suppose that the\r\noil increases proportionably to the increased size of the berry; and\r\nmore particularly so when it is so clearly proved that such is not the\r\ncase, with reference to the variety known as the royal olive, by some\r\ncalled majorina, and by others phaulia;[1665] this berry being of the\r\nvery largest size, and yet yielding a minimum of juice. In Egypt,[1666]\r\ntoo, the berries, which are remarkably meaty, are found to produce but\r\nvery little oil; while those of Decapolis, in Syria, are so extremely\r\nsmall, that they are no bigger than a caper; and yet they are highly\r\nesteemed for their flesh.[1667] It is for this reason that the olives\r\nfrom the parts beyond sea are preferred for table to those of Italy,\r\nthough, at the same time, they are very inferior to them for making oil.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, those of Picenum and of Sidicina[1668] are considered the\r\nbest for table. These are kept apart from the others and steeped in\r\nsalt, after which, like other olives, they are put in amurca, or else\r\nboiled wine; indeed, some of them are left to float solely in their\r\nown oil,[1669] without any adventitious mode of preparation, and are\r\nthen known as colymbades: sometimes the berry is crushed, and then\r\nseasoned with green herbs to flavour it. Even in an unripe state the\r\nolive is rendered fit for eating by being sprinkled with boiling water;\r\nit is quite surprising, too, how readily it will imbibe sweet juices,\r\nand retain an adventitious flavour from foreign substances. With this\r\nfruit, as with the grape, there are purple[1670] varieties, and the\r\nposia is of a complexion approaching to black. Besides those already\r\nmentioned, there are the superba[1671] and a remarkably luscious kind,\r\nwhich dries of itself, and is even sweeter than the raisin: this last\r\nvariety is extremely rare, and is to be found in Africa and in the\r\nvicinity of Emerita[1672] in Lusitania.\r\n\r\nThe oil of the olive is prevented from getting[1673] thick and rancid\r\nby the admixture of salt. By making an incision in the bark of the\r\ntree, an aromatic odour may be imparted[1674] to the oil. Any other\r\nmode of seasoning, such, for instance, as those used with reference\r\nto wine, is not at all gratifying to the palate; nor do we find so\r\nmany varieties in oil as there are in the produce of the grape, there\r\nbeing, in general, but three different degrees of goodness. In fine\r\noil the odour is more penetrating, but even in the very best it is but\r\nshort-lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (4.)—THE NATURE OF OLIVE OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is one of the properties of oil to impart warmth to the body, and\r\nto protect it against the action of cold; while at the same time it\r\npromotes coolness in the head when heated. The Greeks, those parents\r\nof all vices, have abused it by making it minister to luxury, and\r\nemploying it commonly in the gymnasium: indeed, it is a well-known\r\nfact that the governors of those establishments have sold the\r\nscrapings[1675] of the oil used there for a sum of eighty thousand\r\nsesterces. The majesty of the Roman sway has conferred high honour upon\r\nthe olive: crowned with it, the troops of the Equestrian order are wont\r\nto defile upon the ides of July;[1676] it is used, too, by the victor\r\nin the minor triumphs of the ovation.[1677] At Athens, also, they are\r\nin the habit of crowning the conqueror with olive; and at Olympia, the\r\nGreeks employ the wild olive[1678] for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (5.)—THE CULTURE OF THE OLIVE: ITS MODE OF PRESERVATION. THE\r\nMETHOD OF MAKING OLIVE OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to mention the precepts given by Cato[1679] in\r\nrelation to this subject. Upon a warm, rich[1680] soil, he recommends\r\nus to sow the greater radius, the Salentina, the orchites, the\r\nposia, the Sergian, the Cominian, and the albicera;[1681] but with a\r\nremarkable degree of prudence he adds, that those varieties ought to\r\nbe planted in preference which are considered to thrive best in the\r\nneighbouring localities. In a cold[1682] and meagre soil he says that\r\nthe Licinian olive should be planted; and he informs us that a rich or\r\nhot soil has the effect, in this last variety, of spoiling the oil,\r\nwhile the tree becomes exhausted by its own fertility, and is liable to\r\nbe attacked by a sort of red moss.[1683] He states it as his opinion\r\nthat the olive grounds ought to have a western aspect, and, indeed, he\r\napproves of no other.\r\n\r\n(6.) According to him, the best method of preserving olives is to put\r\nthe orchites and the posia, while green, in a strong brine, or else\r\nto bruise them first, and preserve them in mastich oil.[1684] The\r\nmore bitter the olive, he says, the better the oil; but they should\r\nbe gathered from the ground the very moment they fall, and washed if\r\nthey are dirty. He says that three days will be quite sufficient for\r\ndrying them, and that if it is frosty weather, they should be pressed\r\non the fourth, care being taken to sprinkle them with salt. Olives, he\r\ninforms us,[1685] lose oil by being kept in a boarded store-room, and\r\ndeteriorate in quality; the same being the case, too, if the oil is\r\nleft with the amurca and the pulp,[1686] or, in other words, the flesh\r\nof the olive that forms the residue and becomes the dregs. For this\r\nreason, he recommends that the oil should be poured off several times\r\nin the day, and then put into vessels or cauldrons[1687] of lead, for\r\ncopper vessels will spoil it, he says. All these operations, however,\r\nshould be carried on with presses heated and tightly closed,[1688] and\r\nexposed to the air as little as possible—for which reason he recommends\r\nthat wood should never be cut there, the most convenient fuel for the\r\nfires being the stones of the berries. From the cauldron the oil should\r\nbe poured into vats,[1689] in order that the pulp and the amurca may\r\nbe disengaged in a solidified form: to effect which object the vessels\r\nshould be changed as often as convenient, while at the same time the\r\nosier baskets should be carefully cleaned with a sponge, that the oil\r\nmay run out in as clean and pure a state as possible.\r\n\r\nIn later times, the plan has been adopted of invariably crushing the\r\nolives in boiling water, and at once putting them whole in the press—a\r\nmethod of effectually extracting the amurca—and then, after crushing\r\nthem in the oil-press, subjecting them to pressure once more. It is\r\nrecommended, that not more than one hundred modii should be pressed at\r\none time: the name given to this quantity is “factus,”[1690] while the\r\noil that flows out at the first pressure is called the “flos.”[1691]\r\nFour men, working at two presses day and night, ought to be able to\r\npress out three factuses of olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (7.)—FORTY-EIGHT VARIETIES OF ARTIFICIAL OILS. THE CICUS-TREE\r\nOR CROTON, OR SILI, OR SESAMUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those times artificial oils had not been introduced, and hence\r\nit is, I suppose, that we find no mention made of them by Cato; at\r\nthe present day the varieties are very numerous. We will first speak\r\nof those[1692] which are produced from trees, and among them more\r\nparticularly the wild olive.[1693] This olive is small, and much more\r\nbitter than the cultivated one, and hence its oil is only used in\r\nmedicinal preparations: the oil that bears the closest resemblance\r\nto it is that extracted from the chamelæa,[1694] a shrub which grows\r\namong the rocks, and not more than a palm in height; the leaves and\r\nberries being similar to those of the wild olive. A third oil is that\r\nmade of the fruit of the cicus,[1695] a tree which grows in Egypt in\r\ngreat abundance; by some it is known as croton, by others as sili, and\r\nby others, again, as wild sesamum: it is not so very long since this\r\ntree was first introduced here. In Spain, too, it shoots up with great\r\nrapidity to the size of the olive-tree, having a stem like that of\r\nthe ferula, the leaf of the vine, and a seed that bears a resemblance\r\nto a small pale grape. Our people are in the habit of calling it\r\n“ricinus,”[1696] from the resemblance of the seed to that insect. It\r\nis boiled in water,[1697] and the oil that swims on the surface is\r\nthen skimmed off: but in Egypt, where it grows in a greater abundance,\r\nthe oil is extracted without employing either fire or water for the\r\npurpose, the seed being first sprinkled with salt, and then subjected\r\nto pressure: eaten with food this oil is repulsive, but it is very\r\nuseful for burning in lamps.\r\n\r\nAmygdalinum, by some persons known as “metopium,”[1698] is made of\r\nbitter almonds dried and beaten into a cake, after which they are\r\nsteeped in water, and then beaten again. An oil is extracted from the\r\nlaurel also, with the aid of olive oil. Some persons use the berries\r\nonly for this purpose, while others, again, employ the leaves[1699]\r\nand the outer skin of the berries: some add storax also, and other\r\nodoriferous substances. The best kind for this purpose is the\r\nbroad-leaved or wild laurel,[1700] with a black berry. The oil, too, of\r\nthe black myrtle is of a similar nature; that with the broad leaf[1701]\r\nis reckoned also the best. The berries are first sprinkled with warm\r\nwater, and then beaten, after which they are boiled: some persons take\r\nthe more tender leaves, and boil them in olive oil, and then subject\r\nthem to pressure, while others, again, steep them in oil, and leave the\r\nmixture to ripen in the sun. The same method is also adopted with the\r\ncultivated myrtle, but the wild variety with small berries is generally\r\npreferred; by some it is known as the oxymyrsine, by others as the\r\nchamæmyrsine, and by others, again, as the acoron,[1702] from its\r\nstrong resemblance to that plant, it being short and branching.\r\n\r\nAn oil is made, too, from the citrus,[1703] and from the cypress; also,\r\nfrom the walnut,[1704] and known by the name of “caryinon,”[1705]\r\nand from the fruit of the cedar, being generally known as\r\n“pisselæon.”[1706] Oil is extracted from the grain of Cnidos,[1707]\r\nthe seed being first thoroughly cleaned, and then pounded; and from\r\nmastich[1708] also. As to the oil called “cyprinum,”[1709] and that\r\nextracted from the Egyptian[1710] berry, we have already mentioned the\r\nmode in which they are prepared as perfumes. The Indians, too, are\r\nsaid to extract oils from the chesnut,[1711] sesamum, and rice,[1712]\r\nand the Ichthyophagi[1713] from fish. Scarcity of oil for the supply\r\nof lamps sometimes compels us to make it from the berries[1714] of the\r\nplane-tree, which are first steeped in salt and water.\r\n\r\nŒnanthinum,[1715] again, is made from the œnanthe, as we have already\r\nstated when speaking of perfumes. In making gleucinum,[1716] must is\r\nboiled with olive-oil at a slow heat; some persons, however, do not\r\nemploy fire in making it, but leave a vessel, filled with oil and\r\nmust, surrounded with grape husks, for two and twenty days, taking\r\ncare to stir it twice a day: by the end of that period the whole of\r\nthe must is imbibed by the oil. Some persons mix with this not only\r\nsampsuchum, but perfumes of still greater price: that, too, which is\r\nused in the gymnasia is scented with perfumes as well, but those of the\r\nvery lowest quality. Oils are made, too, from aspalathus,[1717] from\r\ncalamus,[1718] balsamum,[1719] cardamum,[1720] melilot, Gallic nard,\r\npanax,[1721] sampsuchum,[1722] helenium, and root of cinnamomum,[1723]\r\nthe plants being first left to steep in oil, and then pressed.\r\nIn a similar manner, too, rhodinum[1724] is made from roses, and\r\njuncinum from the sweet rush, bearing a remarkable[1725] resemblance\r\nto rose-oil: other oils, again, are extracted from henbane,[1726]\r\nlupines,[1727] and narcissus. Great quantities of oil are made in\r\nEgypt, too, of radish[1728] seed, or else of a common grass known there\r\nas chortinon.[1729] Sesamum[1730] also yields an oil, and so does\r\nthe nettle,[1731] its oil being known as “cnidinum.”[1732] In other\r\ncountries, too, an oil is extracted from lilies[1733] left to steep\r\nin the open air, and subjected to the influence of the sun, moon, and\r\nfrosts. On the borders of Cappadocia and Galatia, they make an oil\r\nfrom the herbs of the country, known as “Selgicum,”[1734] remarkably\r\nuseful for strengthening the tendons, similar, in fact, to that of\r\nIguvium[1735] in Italy. From pitch an oil[1736] is extracted, that\r\nis known as “pissinum” it is made by boiling the pitch, and spreading\r\nfleeces over the vessels to catch the steam, and then wringing them\r\nout: the most approved kind is that which comes from Bruttium, the\r\npitch of that country being remarkably rich and resinous: the colour of\r\nthis oil is yellow.\r\n\r\nThere is an oil that grows spontaneously in the maritime parts of\r\nSyria, known to us as “elæomeli;”[1737] it is an unctuous substance\r\nwhich distils from certain trees, of a thicker consistency than honey,\r\nbut somewhat thinner than resin; it has a sweet flavour, and is\r\nemployed for medicinal purposes. Old olive oil[1738] is of use for some\r\nkinds of maladies; it is thought to be particularly useful, too, in\r\nthe preservation of ivory from decay:[1739] at all events, the statue\r\nof Saturn, at Rome, is filled with oil in the interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (8.)—AMURCA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is upon the praises of amurca[1740] more particularly, that\r\nCato[1741] has enlarged. He recommends that vats and casks[1742] for\r\nkeeping oil should be first seasoned with it, to prevent them from\r\nsoaking up the oil; and he tells us that threshing-floors should be\r\nwell rubbed with it, to keep away ants,[1743] and to prevent any chinks\r\nor crannies from being left. The mortar, too, of walls, he says, ought\r\nto be seasoned with it, as well as the roofs and floors of granaries;\r\nand he recommends that wardrobes should be sprinkled with amurca as a\r\npreservative against wood-worms and other noxious insects. He says,\r\ntoo, that all grain of the cereals should be steeped in it, and speaks\r\nof it as efficacious for the cure of maladies in cattle as well as\r\ntrees, and as useful even for ulcerations in the inside and upon the\r\nface of man. We learn from him, also, that thongs, all articles made\r\nof leather, sandals, and axle-trees used to be anointed with boiled\r\namurca; which was employed also to preserve copper vessels against\r\nverdigrease,[1744] and to give them a better colour; as also for the\r\nseasoning of all utensils made of wood, as well as the earthen jars in\r\nwhich dried figs were kept, or of sprigs of myrtle with the leaves and\r\nberries on, or any other articles of a similar nature: in addition to\r\nwhich, he asserts that wood which has been steeped in amurca will burn\r\nwithout producing a stifling smoke.[1745]\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Varro,[1746] an olive-tree which has been licked by\r\nthe tongue of the she-goat, or upon which she has browsed when it was\r\nfirst budding,[1747] is sure to be barren. Thus much in reference to\r\nthe olive and the oils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (9.)—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF FRUIT-TREES AND THEIR NATURES. FOUR\r\nVARIETIES OF PINE-NUTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other fruits found on trees can hardly be enumerated, from their\r\ndiversity in shape and figure, without reference to their different\r\nflavours and juices, which have again been modified by repeated\r\ncombinations and graftings.\r\n\r\n(10.) The largest fruit, and, indeed, the one that hangs at the\r\ngreatest height, is the pine-nut. It contains within a number of small\r\nkernels, enclosed in arched beds, and covered with a coat of their own\r\nof rusty iron-colour; Nature thus manifesting a marvellous degree of\r\ncare in providing its seeds with a soft receptacle. Another variety\r\nof this nut is the terentina,[1748] the shell of which may be broken\r\nwith the fingers; and hence it becomes a prey to the birds while still\r\non the tree. A third, again, is known as the “sappinia,[1749]” being\r\nthe produce of the cultivated pitch-tree: the kernels are enclosed\r\nin a skin more than a shell, which is so remarkably soft that it is\r\neaten together with the fruit. A fourth variety is that known as the\r\n“pityis;” it is the produce of the pinaster,[1750] and is remarkable\r\nas a good specific for coughs. The kernels are sometimes boiled\r\nin honey[1751] among the Taurini, who then call them “aquiceli.”\r\nThe conquerors at the Isthmian games are crowned with a wreath of\r\npine-leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (11.)—THE QUINCE. FOUR KINDS OF CYDONIA, AND FOUR VARIETIES\r\nOF THE STRUTHEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in size after these are the fruit called by us “cotonea,”[1752]\r\nby the Greeks “Cydonia,”[1753] and first introduced from the island\r\nof Crete. These fruit bend the branches with their weight, and so tend\r\nto impede the growth of the parent tree. The varieties are numerous.\r\nThe chrysomelum[1754] is marked with indentations down it, and has\r\na colour inclining to gold; the one that is known as the “Italian”\r\nquince, is of a paler complexion, and has a most exquisite smell:\r\nthe quinces of Neapolis, too, are held in high esteem. The smaller\r\nvarieties of the quince which are known as the “struthea,”[1755]\r\nhave a more pungent smell, but ripen later than the others; that\r\ncalled the “musteum,”[1756] ripens the soonest of all. The cotoneum\r\nengrafted[1757] on the strutheum, has produced a peculiar variety,\r\nknown as the “Mulvianum,” the only one of them all that is eaten\r\nraw.[1758] At the present day all these varieties are kept shut up in\r\nthe antechambers of great men,[1759] where they receive the visits of\r\ntheir courtiers; they are hung, too, upon the statues[1760] that pass\r\nthe night with us in our chambers.\r\n\r\nThere is a small wild[1761] quince also, the smell of which, next to\r\nthat of the strutheum, is the most powerful; it grows in the hedges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—SIX VARIETIES OF THE PEACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the head of apples,[1762] we include a variety of fruits,\r\nalthough of an entirely different nature, such as the Persian[1763]\r\napple, for instance, and the pomegranate, of which, when speaking\r\nof the tree, we have already enumerated[1764] nine varieties. The\r\npomegranate has a seed within, enclosed in a skin; the peach has a\r\nstone inside. Some among the pears, also, known as “libralia,”[1765]\r\nshow, by their name, what a remarkable weight they attain.\r\n\r\n(12.) Among the peaches the palm must be awarded to the\r\nduracinus:[1766] the Gallic and the Asiatic peach are distinguished\r\nrespectively by the names of the countries of their origin. They ripen\r\nat the end of autumn, though some of the early[1767] kinds are ripe in\r\nthe summer. It is only within the last thirty years that these last\r\nhave been introduced; originally they were sold at the price of a\r\ndenarius a piece. Those known as the “supernatia”[1768] come from the\r\ncountry of the Sabines, but the “popularia” grow everywhere. This is a\r\nvery harmless fruit, and a particular favourite with invalids: some, in\r\nfact, have sold before this as high as thirty sesterces apiece, a price\r\nthat has never been exceeded by any other fruit. This, too, is the more\r\nto be wondered at, as there is none that is a worse keeper: for, when\r\nit is once plucked, the longest time that it will keep is a couple of\r\ndays; and so sold it must be, fetch what it may.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (13).—TWELVE KINDS OF PLUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext comes a vast number of varieties of the plum, the parti-coloured,\r\nthe black,[1769] the white,[1770] the barley[1771] plum—so called,\r\nbecause it is ripe at barley-harvest—and another of the same colour as\r\nthe last, but which ripens later, and is of a larger size, generally\r\nknown as the “asinina,”[1772] from the little esteem in which it is\r\nheld. There are the onychina, too, the cerina,[1773]—more esteemed,\r\nand the purple[1774] plum: the Armenian,[1775] also an exotic from\r\nforeign parts, the only one among the plums that recommends itself by\r\nits smell. The plum-tree grafted on the nut exhibits what we may call\r\na piece of impudence quite its own, for it produces a fruit that has\r\nall the appearance of the parent stock, together with the juice of the\r\nadopted fruit: in consequence of its being thus compounded of both,\r\nit is known by the name of “nuci-pruna.”[1776] Nut-prunes, as well\r\nas the peach, the wild plum,[1777] and the cerina, are often put in\r\ncasks, and so kept till the crop comes of the following year. All the\r\nother varieties ripen with the greatest rapidity, and pass off just\r\nas quickly. More recently, in Bætica, they have begun to introduce\r\nwhat they call “malina,” or the fruit of the plum engrafted on the\r\napple-tree,[1778] and “amygdalina,” the fruit of the plum engrafted\r\non the almond-tree,[1779] the kernel found in the stone of these last\r\nbeing that of the almond;[1780] indeed, there is no specimen in which\r\ntwo fruits have been more ingeniously combined in one.\r\n\r\nAmong the foreign trees we have already spoken[1781] of the\r\nDamascene[1782] plum, so called from Damascus, in Syria, but introduced\r\nlong since into Italy; though the stone of this plum is larger than\r\nusual, and the flesh smaller in quantity. This plum will never dry\r\nso far as to wrinkle; to effect that, it needs the sun of its own\r\nnative country. The myxa,[1783] too, may be mentioned, as being the\r\nfellow-countryman of the Damascene: it has of late been introduced into\r\nRome, and has been grown engrafted upon the sorb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—THE PEACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of “Persica,” or “Persian apple,” given to this fruit, fully\r\nproves that it is an exotic in both Greece as well as Asia,[1784] and\r\nthat it was first introduced from Persis. As to the wild plum, it is\r\na well-known fact that it will grow anywhere; and I am, therefore,\r\nthe more surprised that no mention has been made of it by Cato, more\r\nparticularly as he has pointed out the method of preserving several\r\nof the wild fruits as well. As to the peach-tree, it has been only\r\nintroduced of late years, and with considerable difficulty; so much\r\nso, that it is perfectly barren in the Isle of Rhodes, the first\r\nresting-place[1785] that it found after leaving Egypt.\r\n\r\nIt is quite untrue that the peach which grows in Persia is poisonous,\r\nand produces dreadful tortures, or that the kings of that country,\r\nfrom motives of revenge, had it transplanted in Egypt, where, through\r\nthe nature of the soil, it lost all its evil properties—for we find\r\nthat it is of the “persea”[1786] that the more careful writers have\r\nstated all this,[1787] a totally different tree, the fruit of which\r\nresembles the red myxa, and, indeed, cannot be successfully cultivated\r\nanywhere but in the East. The learned have also maintained that it\r\nwas not introduced from Persis into Egypt with the view of inflicting\r\npunishment, but say that it was planted at Memphis by Perseus; for\r\nwhich reason it was that Alexander gave orders that the victors should\r\nbe crowned with it in the games which he instituted there in honour of\r\nhis[1788] ancestor: indeed, this tree has always leaves and fruit upon\r\nit, growing immediately upon the others. It must be quite evident to\r\nevery one that all our plums have been introduced since the time of\r\nCato.[1789]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (14.)—THIRTY DIFFERENT KINDS OF POMES. AT WHAT PERIOD FOREIGN\r\nFRUITS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED INTO ITALY, AND WHENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous varieties of pomes. Of the citron[1790] we have\r\nalready made mention when describing its tree; the Greeks gave it the\r\nname of “Medica,”[1791] from its native country. The jujube[1792]-tree\r\nand the tuber[1793] are equally exotics; indeed, they have, both of\r\nthem, been introduced only of late years into Italy; the latter from\r\nAfrica, the former from Syria. Sextus Papinius, whom we have seen\r\nconsul,[1794] introduced them both in the latter years of the reign of\r\nAugustus, produced from slips which he had grown within his camp. The\r\nfruit of the jujube more nearly resembles a berry than an apple: the\r\ntree sets off a terrace[1795] remarkably well, and it is not uncommon\r\nto see whole woods of it climbing up to the very roofs of the houses.\r\n\r\nOf the tuber there are two varieties; the white, and the one called\r\n“syricum,”[1796] from its colour. Those fruits, too, may be almost\r\npronounced exotic which grow nowhere in Italy but in the territory of\r\nVerona, and are known as the wool-fruit.[1797] They are covered with a\r\nwoolly down; this is found, it is true, to a very considerable extent,\r\non both the strutheum variety of quince and the peach, but still it has\r\ngiven its name to this particular fruit, which is recommended to us by\r\nno other remarkable quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—THE FRUITS THAT HAVE BEEN MOST RECENTLY INTRODUCED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should I hesitate to make some mention, too, of other varieties by\r\nname, seeing that they have conferred everlasting remembrance on those\r\nwho were the first to introduce them, as having rendered some service\r\nto their fellow-men? Unless I am very much mistaken, an enumeration of\r\nthem will tend to throw some light upon the ingenuity that is displayed\r\nin the art of grafting, and it will be the more easily understood\r\nthat there is nothing so trifling in itself from which a certain\r\namount of celebrity cannot be ensured. Hence it is that we have fruits\r\nwhich derive their names from Matius,[1798] Cestius, Mallius, and\r\nScandius.[1799] Appius, too, a member of the Claudian family, grafted\r\nthe quince on the Scandian fruit, in consequence of which the produce\r\nis known as the Appian. This fruit has the smell of the quince, and is\r\nof the same size as the Scandian apple, and of a ruddy colour. Let no\r\none, however, imagine that this name was merely given in a spirit of\r\nflattery to an illustrious family, for there is an apple known as the\r\nSceptian,[1800] which owes its name to the son of a freedman, who was\r\nthe first to introduce it: it is remarkable for the roundness of its\r\nshape. To those already mentioned, Cato[1801] adds the Quirinian and\r\nthe Scantian varieties, which last, he says, keep remarkably well in\r\nlarge vessels.[1802] The latest kind of all, however, that has been\r\nintroduced is the small apple known as the Petisian,[1803] remarkable\r\nfor its delightful flavour: the Amerinian[1804] apple, too, and the\r\nlittle Greek[1805] have conferred renown on their respective countries.\r\n\r\nThe remaining varieties have received their name from various\r\ncircumstances—the apples known as the “gemella”[1806] are always\r\nfound hanging in pairs upon one stalk, like twins, and never growing\r\nsingly. That known as the “syricum”[1807] is so called from its colour,\r\nwhile the “melapium”[1808] has its name from its strong resemblance\r\nto the pear. The “musteum”[1809] was so called from the rapidity\r\nwith which it ripens; it is the melimelum of the present day, which\r\nderives its appellation from its flavour, being like that of honey.\r\nThe “orbiculatum,”[1810] again, is so called from its shape, which\r\nis exactly spherical—the circumstance of the Greeks having called\r\nit the “epiroticum” proves that it came originally from Epirus. The\r\northomastium[1811] has that peculiar appellation from its resemblance\r\nto a teat; and the “spadonium”[1812] of the Belgæ is so nicknamed from\r\nthe total absence of pips. The melofolium[1813] has one leaf, and\r\noccasionally two, shooting from the middle of the fruit. That known as\r\nthe “pannuceum”[1814] shrivels with the greatest rapidity; while the\r\n“pulmoneum”[1815] has a lumpish, swollen appearance.\r\n\r\nSome apples are just the colour of blood, owing to an original graft\r\nof the mulberry; but they are all of them red on the side which is\r\nturned towards the sun. There are some small wild[1816] apples also,\r\nremarkable for their fine flavour and the peculiar pungency of their\r\nsmell. Some, again, are so remarkably[1817] sour, that they are held\r\nin disesteem; indeed their acidity is so extreme, that it will even\r\ntake the edge from off a knife. The worst apples of all are those which\r\nfrom their mealiness have received the name of “farinacea;”[1818] they\r\nare the first, however, to ripen, and ought to be gathered as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (15.)—FORTY-ONE VARIETIES OF THE PEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nA similar degree of precocity has caused the appellation of\r\n“superbum”[1819] to be given to one species of the pear: it is a\r\nsmall fruit, but ripens with remarkable rapidity. All the world are\r\nextremely partial to the Crustumian[1820] pear; and next to it comes\r\nthe Falernian,[1821] so called from the drink[1822] which it affords,\r\nso abundant is its juice. This juice is known by the name of “milk” in\r\nthe variety which, of a black colour, is by some called the pear of\r\nSyria.[1823] The denominations given to the others vary according to\r\nthe respective localities of their growth. Among the pears, the names\r\nof which have been adopted in our city, the Decimian pear, and the\r\nPseudo-Decimian—an offshoot from it—have conferred considerable renown\r\nupon the name of those who introduced them. The same is the case, too,\r\nwith the variety known as the “Dolabellian,”[1824] remarkable for the\r\nlength of its stalk, the Pomponian,[1825] surnamed the mammosum,[1826]\r\nthe Licerian, the Sevian, the Turranian, a variety of the Sevian,\r\nbut distinguished from it by the greater length of the stalk, the\r\nFavonian,[1827] a red pear, rather larger than the superbum, together\r\nwith the Laterian[1828] and the Anician, which come at the end of\r\nautumn, and are pleasant for the acidity of their flavour. One variety\r\nis known as the “Tiberian,”[1829] from its having been a particular\r\nfavourite with the Emperor Tiberius; it is more coloured by the sun,\r\nand grows to a larger size, otherwise it would be identical with the\r\nLicerian variety.\r\n\r\nThe following kinds receive their respective names from their native\r\ncountries: the Amerinian,[1830] the latest pear of all, the Picentine,\r\nthe Numantine, the Alexandrian, the Numidian, the Greek, a variety\r\nof which is the Tarentine, and the Signine,[1831] by some called\r\n“testaceum,” from its colour, like earthenware; a reason which has also\r\ngiven their respective names to the “onychine”[1832] and the “purple”\r\nkinds. Then, again, we have the “myrapium,”[1833] the “laureum,”\r\nand the “nardinum,”[1834] so called from the odour they emit; the\r\n“hordearium,”[1835] from the season at which it comes[1836] in; and\r\nthe “ampullaceum,”[1837] so called from its long narrow neck. Those,\r\nagain, that are known as the “Coriolanian”[1838] and the “Bruttian,”\r\nowe their names to the places of their origin; added to which we have\r\nthe cucurbitinum,[1839] and the “acidulum,” so named from the acidity\r\nof its juice. It is quite uncertain for what reason their respective\r\nnames were given to the varieties known as the “barbaricum” and the\r\n“Venerium,”[1840] which last is known also as the “coloratum;”[1841]\r\nthe royal pear[1842] too, which has a remarkably short stalk, and\r\nwill stand on its end, as also the patricium, and the voconium,[1843]\r\na green oblong kind. In addition to these, Virgil[1844] has made\r\nmention of a pear called the “volema,”[1845] a name which he has\r\nborrowed from Cato,[1846] who makes mention also of kinds known as the\r\n“sementivum”[1847] and the “musteum.”[1848]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—VARIOUS METHODS OF GRAFTING TREES. EXPIATIONS FOR LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis branch of civilized life has long since been brought to the\r\nvery highest pitch of perfection, for man has left nothing untried\r\nhere. Hence it is that we find Virgil[1849] speaking of grafting the\r\nnut-tree on the arbutus, the apple on the plane, and the cherry on\r\nthe elm. Indeed, there is nothing further in this department that can\r\npossibly be devised, and it is a long time since any new variety of\r\nfruit has been discovered. Religious scruples, too, will not allow of\r\nindiscriminate grafting; thus, for instance, it is not permitted to\r\ngraft upon the thorn, for it is not easy, by any mode of expiation,\r\nto avoid the disastrous effects of lightning; and we are told[1850]\r\nthat as many as are the kinds of trees that have been engrafted on the\r\nthorn, so many are the thunderbolts that will be hurled against that\r\nspot in a single flash.\r\n\r\nThe form of the pear is turbinated; the later kinds remain on the\r\nparent tree till winter, when they ripen with the frost; such, for\r\ninstance, as the Greek variety, the ampullaceum, and the laureum; the\r\nsame, too, with apples of the Amerinian and the Scandian kinds. Apples\r\nand pears are prepared for keeping just like grapes, and in as many\r\ndifferent ways; but, with the exception of plums, they are the only\r\nfruit that are stored in casks.[1851] Apples and pears have certain\r\nvinous[1852] properties, and like wine these drinks are forbidden\r\nto invalids by the physicians. These fruits are sometimes boiled up\r\nwith wine and water, and so make a preserve[1853] that is eaten with\r\nbread; a preparation which is never made of any other fruit, with the\r\nexception of the quinces, known as the “cotoneum” and the “strutheum.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18. (16.)—THE MODE OF KEEPING VARIOUS FRUITS AND GRAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the better preserving of fruits it is universally recommended\r\nthat the storeroom should be situate in a cool, dry spot, with a\r\nwell-boarded floor, and windows looking towards the north; which in\r\nfine weather ought to be kept open. Care should also be taken to keep\r\nout the south wind by window panes,[1854] while at the same time it\r\nshould be borne in mind that a north-east wind will shrivel fruit and\r\nmake it unsightly. Apples are gathered after the autumnal equinox;\r\nbut the gathering should never begin before the sixteenth day of the\r\nmoon, or before the first hour of the day. Windfalls should always be\r\nkept separate, and there ought to be a layer of straw, or else mats or\r\nchaff, placed beneath. They should, also, be placed apart from each\r\nother, in rows, so that the air may circulate freely between them, and\r\nthey may equally gain the benefit of it. The Amerinian apple is the\r\nbest keeper, the melimelum the very worst of all.\r\n\r\n(17.) Quinces ought to be stored in a place kept perfectly closed,\r\nso as to exclude all draughts; or else they should be boiled in\r\nhoney[1855] or soaked in it. Pomegranates are made hard and firm by\r\nbeing first put in boiling[1856] sea-water, and then left to dry for\r\nthree days in the sun, care being taken that the dews of the night do\r\nnot touch them; after which they are hung up, and when wanted for use,\r\nwashed with fresh water. M. Varro[1857] recommends that they should be\r\nkept in large vessels filled with sand: if they are not ripe, he says\r\nthat they should be put in pots with the bottom broken out, and then\r\nburied[1858] in the earth, all access to the air being carefully shut,\r\nand care being first taken to cover the stalk with pitch. By this mode\r\nof treatment, he assures us, they will attain a larger size than they\r\nwould if left to ripen on the tree. As for the other kinds of pomes,\r\nhe says that they should be wrapped up separately in fig-leaves, the\r\nwindfalls being carefully excluded, and then stored in baskets of\r\nosier, or else covered over with potters’ earth.\r\n\r\nPears are kept in earthen vessels pitched inside; when filled, the\r\nvessels are reversed and then buried in pits. The Tarentine pear,\r\nVarro says, is gathered very late, while the Anician keeps very well\r\nin raisin wine. Sorb apples, too, are similarly kept in holes in the\r\nground, the vessel being turned upside down, and a layer of plaster\r\nplaced on the lid: it should be buried two feet deep, in a sunny spot;\r\nsorbs[1859] are also hung, like grapes, in the inside of large vessels,\r\ntogether with the branches.\r\n\r\nSome of the more recent authors are found to pay a more scrupulous\r\ndegree of attention to these various particulars, and recommend that\r\nthe gathering of grapes or pomes, which are intended for keeping,\r\nshould take place while the moon is on the wane,[1860] after the third\r\nhour of the day, and while the weather is clear, or dry winds prevail.\r\nIn a similar manner, the selection, they say, ought to be made from a\r\ndry spot, and the fruit should be plucked before it is fully ripe, a\r\nmoment being chosen while the moon is below the horizon. Grapes, they\r\nsay, should be selected that have a strong, hard mallet-stalk, and\r\nafter the decayed berries have been carefully removed with a pair of\r\nscissors, they should be hung up inside of a large vessel which has\r\njust been pitched, care being taken to close all access to the south\r\nwind, by covering the lid with a coat of plaster. The same method, they\r\nsay, should be adopted for keeping sorb apples and pears, the stalks\r\nbeing carefully covered with pitch; care should be taken, too, that the\r\nvessels are kept at a distance from water.\r\n\r\nThere are some persons who adopt the following method for preserving\r\ngrapes. They take them off together with the branch, and place them,\r\nwhile still upon it, in a layer of plaster,[1861] taking care to fasten\r\neither end of the branch in a bulb of squill.[1862] Others, again, go\r\nso far as to place them within vessels containing wine, taking care,\r\nhowever, that the grapes, as they hang, do not touch it. Some persons\r\nput apples in plates of earth, and then leave them to float in wine,\r\na method by which it is thought that a vinous flavour is imparted to\r\nthem: while some think it a better plan to preserve all these kinds of\r\nfruit in millet. Most people, however, content themselves with first\r\ndigging a hole in the ground, a couple of feet in depth; a layer of\r\nsand is then placed at the bottom, and the fruit is arranged upon\r\nit, and covered with an earthen lid, over which the earth is thrown.\r\nSome persons again even go so far as to give their grapes a coating\r\nof potters’ chalk, and then hang them up when dried in the sun; when\r\nrequired for use, the chalk is removed with water.[1863] Apples are\r\nalso preserved in a similar manner; but with them wine is employed for\r\ngetting off the chalk. Indeed, we find a very similar plan pursued with\r\napples of the finest quality; they have a coating laid upon them of\r\neither plaster or wax; but they are apt, if not quite ripe when this\r\nwas done, by the increase in their size to break their casing.[1864]\r\nWhen apples are thus prepared, they are always laid with the stalk\r\ndownwards.[1865] Some persons pluck the apple together with the branch,\r\nthe ends of which they thrust into the pith of elder,[1866] and then\r\nbury it in the way already pointed out.[1867] There are some who\r\nassign to each apple or pear its separate vessel of clay, and after\r\ncarefully pitching the cover, enclose it again in a larger vessel:\r\noccasionally, too, the fruit is placed on a layer of flocks of wool, or\r\nelse in baskets,[1868] with a lining of chaff and clay. Other persons\r\nfollow a similar plan, but use earthen plates for the purpose; while\r\nothers, again, employ the same method, but dig a hole in the earth, and\r\nafter placing a layer of sand, lay the fruit on top of it, and then\r\ncover the whole with dry earth. Persons, too, are sometimes known to\r\ngive quinces a coating of Pontic[1869] wax, and then plunge them in\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nColumella[1870] informs us, that fruit is kept by being carefully\r\nput in earthen vessels, which then receive a coating of pitch, and\r\nare placed in wells or cisterns to sink to the bottom. The people of\r\nmaritime Liguria, in the vicinity of the Alps, first dry their grapes\r\nin the sun,[1871] and wrap them up in bundles of rushes, which are then\r\ncovered with plaster. The Greeks follow a similar plan, but substitute\r\nfor rushes the leaves of the plane-tree, or of the vine itself, or else\r\nof the fig, which they dry for a single day in the shade, and then\r\nplace in a cask in alternate layers with husks[1872] of grapes. It is\r\nby this method that they preserve the grapes of Cos and Berytus, which\r\nare inferior to none in sweetness. Some persons, when thus preparing\r\nthem, plunge the grapes into lie-ashes the moment they take them from\r\nthe vine, and then dry them in the sun; they then steep them in warm\r\nwater, after which they put them to dry again in the sun: and last of\r\nall, as already mentioned, wrap them up in bundles formed of layers of\r\nleaves and grape husks. There are some who prefer keeping their grapes\r\nin sawdust,[1873] or else in shavings of the fir-tree, poplar, and ash:\r\nwhile others think it the best plan to hang them up in the granary, at\r\na careful distance from the apples, directly after the gathering, being\r\nunder the impression that the very best covering for them as they hang\r\nis the dust[1874] that naturally arises from the floor. Grapes are\r\neffectually protected against the attacks of wasps by being sprinkled\r\nwith oil[1875] spirted from the mouth. Of palm-dates we have already\r\nspoken.[1876]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (18.)—TWENTY-NINE VARIETIES OF THE FIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the remaining fruits that are included under the name of\r\n“pomes,” the fig[1877] is the largest: some, indeed, equal the pear,\r\neven, in size. We have already mentioned, while treating of the exotic\r\nfruits, the miraculous productions of Egypt and Cyprus[1878] in the\r\nway of figs. The fig of Mount Ida[1879] is red, and the size of an\r\nolive, rounder however, and like a medlar in flavour; they give it the\r\nname of Alexandrian in those parts. The stem is a cubit in thickness;\r\nit is branchy, has a tough, pliant wood, is entirely destitute of all\r\nmilky juice,[1880] and has a green bark, and leaves like those of\r\nthe linden tree, but soft to the touch. Onesicritus states that in\r\nHyrcania the figs are much sweeter than with us, and that the trees\r\nare more prolific, seeing that a single tree will bear as much as two\r\nhundred and seventy modii[1881] of fruit. The fig has been introduced\r\ninto Italy from other countries, Chalcis and Chios, for instance, the\r\nvarieties being very numerous: there are those from Lydia also, which\r\nare of a purple colour, and the kind known as the “mamillana,”[1882]\r\nwhich is very similar to the Lydian. The callistruthiæ are very little\r\nsuperior to the last in flavour; they are the coldest by nature of all\r\nthe figs. As to the African fig, by many people preferred to any other,\r\nit has been made the subject of very considerable discussion, as it is\r\na kind that has been introduced very recently into Africa, though it\r\nbears the name of that country. As to the fig of Alexandria,[1883] it\r\nis a black variety, with the cleft inclining to white; it has had the\r\nname given to it of the “delicate”[1884] fig: the Rhodian fig, too, and\r\nthe Tiburtine,[1885] one of the early kinds, are black. Some of them,\r\nagain, bear the name of the persons who were the first to introduce\r\nthem, such, for instance, as the Livian[1886] and the Pompeian[1887]\r\nfigs: this last variety is the best for drying in the sun and keeping\r\nfor use, from year to year; the same is the case, too, with the\r\nmarisca,[1888] and the kind which has a leaf spotted all over like the\r\nreed.[1889] There is also the Herculanean fig, the albicerata,[1890]\r\nand the white aratia, a very large variety, with an extremely\r\ndiminutive stalk.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of them all is the porphyritis,[1891] which has a stalk\r\nof remarkable length: it is closely followed by the popularis,[1892]\r\none of the very smallest of the figs, and so called from the low esteem\r\nin which it is held: on the other hand, the chelidonia[1893] is a kind\r\nthat ripens the last of all, and towards the beginning of winter. In\r\naddition to these, there are figs that are at the same time both late\r\nand early, as they bear two crops in the year, one white and the other\r\nblack,[1894] ripening at harvest-time and vintage respectively. There\r\nis another late fig also, that has received its name from the singular\r\nhardness of its skin; one of the Chalcidian varieties bears as many as\r\nthree times in the year. It is at Tarentum only that the remarkably\r\nsweet fig is grown which is known by the name of “ona.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of figs, Cato has the following remarks: “Plant the fig called\r\nthe ‘marisca’ on a chalky or open site, but for the African variety,\r\nthe Herculanean, the Saguntine,[1895] the winter fig and the black\r\nTelanian[1896] with a long stalk, you must select a richer soil, or\r\nelse a ground well manured.” Since his day there have so many names and\r\nkinds come up, that even on taking this subject into consideration,\r\nit must be apparent to every one how great are the changes which have\r\ntaken place in civilized life.\r\n\r\nThere are winter figs, too, in some of the provinces, the Mœsian, for\r\ninstance; but they are made so by artificial means, such not being in\r\nreality their nature. Being a small variety of the fig-tree, they cover\r\nit up with manure at the end of autumn, by which means the fruit on\r\nit is overtaken by winter while still in a green state: then when the\r\nweather becomes milder the fruit is uncovered along with the tree, and\r\nso restored to light. Just as though it had come into birth afresh,\r\nthe fruit imbibes the heat of the new sun with the greatest avidity—a\r\ndifferent sun, in fact, to that[1897] which originally gave it life—and\r\nso ripens along with the blossom of the coming crop; thus attaining\r\nmaturity in a year not its own, and this in a country,[1898] too, where\r\nthe greatest cold prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—HISTORICAL ANECDOTES CONNECTED WITH THE FIG.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1899] The mention by Cato of the variety which bears the name of the\r\nAfrican fig, strongly recalls to my mind a remarkable fact connected\r\nwith it and the country from which it takes its name.\r\n\r\nBurning with a mortal hatred to Carthage, anxious, too, for the safety\r\nof his posterity, and exclaiming at every sitting of the senate that\r\nCarthage must be destroyed, Cato one day brought with him into the\r\nSenate-house a ripe fig, the produce of that country. Exhibiting it to\r\nthe assembled senators, “I ask you,” said he, “when, do you suppose,\r\nthis fruit was plucked from the tree?” All being of opinion that it\r\nhad been but lately gathered,—“Know then,” was his reply, “that this\r\nfig was plucked at Carthage but the day before yesterday[1900]—so near\r\nis the enemy to our walls.” It was immediately after this occurrence\r\nthat the third Punic war commenced, in which Carthage was destroyed;\r\nthough Cato had breathed his last, the year after this event. In this\r\ntrait which are we the most to admire? was it ingenuity[1901] and\r\nforesight on his part, or was it an accident that was thus aptly turned\r\nto advantage? which, too, is the most surprising, the extraordinary\r\nquickness of the passage which must have been made, or the bold daring\r\nof the man? The thing, however, that is the most astonishing of\r\nall—indeed, I can conceive nothing more truly marvellous—is the fact\r\nthat a city thus mighty, the rival of Rome for the sovereignty of the\r\nworld during a period of one hundred and twenty years, owed its fall at\r\nlast to an illustration drawn from a single fig!\r\n\r\nThus did this fig effect that which neither Trebia nor Thrasimenus,\r\nnot Cannæ itself, graced with the entombment of the Roman renown, not\r\nthe Punic camp entrenched within three miles of the city, not even\r\nthe disgrace of seeing Hannibal riding up to the Colline Gate, could\r\nsuggest the means of accomplishing. It was left for a fig, in the hand\r\nof Cato, to show how near was Carthage to the gates of Rome!\r\n\r\nIn the Forum even, and in the very midst of the Comitium[1902] of Rome,\r\na fig-tree is carefully cultivated, in memory of the consecration which\r\ntook place on the occasion of a thunderbolt[1903] which once fell on\r\nthat spot; and still more, as a memorial of the fig-tree which in\r\nformer days overshadowed Romulus and Remus, the founders of our empire,\r\nin the Lupercal Cave. This tree received the name of “ruminalis,”\r\nfrom the circumstance that under it the wolf was found giving the\r\nbreast—_rumis_ it was called in those days—to the two infants. A group\r\nin bronze was afterwards erected to consecrate the remembrance of this\r\nmiraculous event, as, through the agency of Attus Navius the augur, the\r\ntree itself had passed spontaneously from its original locality[1904]\r\nto the Comitium in the Forum. And not without some direful presage is\r\nit that that tree has withered away, though, thanks to the care of the\r\npriesthood, it has been since replaced.[1905]\r\n\r\nThere was another fig-tree also, before the temple of Saturn,[1906]\r\nwhich was removed on the occasion of a sacrifice made by the Vestal\r\nVirgins, it being found that its roots were gradually undermining the\r\nstatue of the god Silvanus. Another one, accidentally planted there,\r\nflourished in the middle of the Forum,[1907] upon the very spot, too,\r\nin which, when from a direful presage it had been foreboded that the\r\ngrowing empire was about to sink to its very foundations, Curtius, at\r\nthe price of an inestimable treasure—in other words, by the sacrifice\r\nof such unbounded virtue and piety—redeemed his country by a glorious\r\ndeath. By a like accident, too, a vine and an olive-tree have sprung\r\nup in the same spot,[1908] which have ever since been carefully tended\r\nby the populace for the agreeable shade which they afford. The altar\r\nthat once stood there was afterwards removed by order of the deified\r\nJulius Cæsar, upon the occasion of the last spectacle of gladiatorial\r\ncombats[1909] which he gave in the Forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—CAPRIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fig, the only one among all the pomes, hastens to maturity by the\r\naid of a remarkable provision of Nature. (19.) The wild-fig,[1910]\r\nknown by the name of “caprificus,” never ripens itself, though it\r\nis able to impart to the others the principle of which it is thus\r\ndestitute; for we occasionally find Nature making a transfer of what\r\nare primary causes, and being generated from decay. To effect this\r\npurpose the wild fig-tree produces a kind of gnat.[1911] These\r\ninsects, deprived of all sustenance from their parent tree, at the\r\nmoment that it is hastening to rottenness and decay, wing their flight\r\nto others of kindred though cultivated kind. There feeding with avidity\r\nupon the fig, they penetrate it in numerous places, and by thus making\r\ntheir way to the inside, open the pores of the fruit.[1912] The moment\r\nthey effect their entrance, the heat of the sun finds admission too,\r\nand through the inlets thus made the fecundating air is introduced.\r\nThese insects speedily consume the milky juice that constitutes the\r\nchief support of the fruit in its infant[1913] state, a result which\r\nwould otherwise be spontaneously effected by absorption: and hence it\r\nis that in the plantations of figs a wild fig is usually allowed to\r\ngrow, being placed to the windward of the other trees in order that\r\nthe breezes may bear from it upon them. Improving upon this discovery,\r\nbranches of the wild fig are sometimes brought from a distance, and\r\nbundles tied together are placed upon the cultivated tree. This method,\r\nhowever, is not necessary when the trees are growing on a thin soil,\r\nor on a site exposed to the north-east wind; for in these cases the\r\nfigs will dry spontaneously, and the clefts which are made in the\r\nfruit effect the same ripening process which in other instances is\r\nbrought about by the agency of these insects. Nor is it requisite to\r\nadopt this plan on spots which are liable to dust, such, for instance,\r\nas is generally the case with fig-trees planted by the side of\r\nmuch-frequented roads: the dust having the property of drying up[1914]\r\nthe juices of the fig, and so absorbing the milky humours. There is\r\nthis superiority, however, in an advantageous site over the methods\r\nof ripening by the agency of dust or by caprification, that the fruit\r\nis not so apt to fall; for the secretion of the juices being thus\r\nprevented, the fig is not so heavy as it would otherwise be, and the\r\nbranches are less brittle.\r\n\r\nAll figs are soft to the touch, and when ripe contain grains[1915] in\r\nthe interior. The juice, when the fruit is ripening, has the taste of\r\nmilk, and when dead ripe, that of honey. If left on the tree they will\r\ngrow old; and when in that state, they distil a liquid that flows in\r\ntears[1916] like gum. Those that are more highly esteemed are kept\r\nfor drying, and the most approved kinds are put away for keeping in\r\nbaskets.[1917] The figs of the island of Ebusus[1918] are the best as\r\nwell as the largest, and next to them are those of Marrucinum.[1919]\r\nWhere figs are in great abundance, as in Asia, for instance, huge\r\njars[1920] are filled with them, and at Ruspina, a city of Africa, we\r\nfind casks[1921] used for a similar purpose: here, in a dry state,\r\nthey are extensively used instead of bread,[1922] and indeed as a\r\ngeneral article of provision.[1923] Cato,[1924] when laying down\r\ncertain definite regulations for the support of labourers employed in\r\nagriculture, recommends that their supply of food should be lessened\r\njust at the time[1925] when the fig is ripening: it has been a plan\r\nadopted in more recent times, to find a substitute for salt with\r\ncheese, by eating fresh figs. To this class of fruit belong, as we\r\nhave already mentioned,[1926] the cottana and the carica, together\r\nwith the cavnea,[1927] which was productive of so bad an omen to M.\r\nCrassus at the moment when he was embarking[1928] for his expedition\r\nagainst the Parthians, a dealer happening to be crying them just at\r\nthat very moment. L. Vitellius, who was more recently appointed to the\r\ncensorship,[1929] introduced all these varieties from Syria at his\r\ncountry-seat at Alba,[1930] having acted as legatus in that province in\r\nthe latter years of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (20.)—THREE VARIETIES OF THE MEDLAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medlar and the sorb[1931] ought in propriety to be ranked under\r\nthe head of the apple and the pear. Of the medlar[1932] there are\r\nthree varieties, the anthedon,[1933] the setania,[1934] and a third of\r\ninferior quality, which bears a stronger resemblance to the anthedon,\r\nand is known as the Gallic[1935] kind. The setania is the largest\r\nfruit, and the palest in colour; the woody seed in the inside of it\r\nis softer, too, than in the others, which are of smaller size than\r\nthe setania, but superior to it in the fragrance of their smell, and\r\nin being better keepers. The tree itself is one of very ample[1936]\r\ndimensions: the leaves turn red before they fall: the roots are\r\nnumerous, and penetrate remarkably deep, which renders it almost\r\nimpossible to grub it up. This tree[1937] did not exist in Italy in\r\nCato’s time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23. (21).—FOUR VARIETIES OF THE SORB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are four varieties of the sorb: there being some that have all\r\nthe roundness[1938] of the apple, while others are conical like the\r\npear,[1939] and a third sort are of an oval[1940] shape, like some of\r\nthe apples: these last, however, are apt to be remarkably acid. The\r\nround kind is the best for fragrance and sweetness, the others having\r\na vinous flavour; the finest, however, are those which have the stalk\r\nsurrounded with tender leaves. A fourth kind is known by the name of\r\n“torminalis:”[1941] it is only employed, however, for remedial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a good bearer, but does not resemble the other kinds,\r\nthe leaf being nearly that of the plane-tree; the fruit, too, is\r\nparticularly small. Cato[1942] speaks of sorbs being preserved in\r\nboiled wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24. (22.)—NINE VARIETIES OF THE NUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe walnut,[1943] which would almost claim precedence of the sorb in\r\nsize, yields the palm to it in reference to the esteem[1944] in which\r\nthey are respectively held; and this, although it is so favourite an\r\naccompaniment of the Fescennine[1945] songs at nuptials. This nut,\r\ntaken as a whole, is very considerably smaller than the pine nut, but\r\nthe kernel is larger in proportion. Nature, too, has conferred upon\r\nit a peculiar honour, in protecting it with a two-fold covering, the\r\nfirst of which forms a hollowed cushion for it to rest upon, and the\r\nsecond is a woody shell. It is for this reason that this fruit has been\r\nlooked upon as a symbol consecrated to marriage,[1946] its offspring\r\nbeing thus protected in such manifold ways: an explanation which bears\r\na much greater air of probability than that which would derive it from\r\nthe rattling which it makes when it bounds from the floor.[1947] The\r\nGreek names that have been given to this fruit fully prove that it,\r\nlike many others, has been originally introduced from Persis; the best\r\nkinds being known in that language by the names of “Persicum,”[1948]\r\nand “basilicon;”[1949] these, in fact, being the names by which they\r\nwere first known to us. It is generally agreed, too, that one peculiar\r\nvariety has derived its name of “caryon,”[1950] from the headache which\r\nit is apt to produce by the pungency[1951] of its smell.\r\n\r\nThe green shell of the walnut is used for dyeing[1952] wool, and the\r\nnuts, while still small and just developing themselves, are employed\r\nfor giving a red hue to the hair:[1953] a discovery owing to the\r\nstains which they leave upon the hands. When old, the nut becomes more\r\noleaginous. The only difference in the several varieties consists\r\nin the relative hardness or brittleness of the shell, it being thin\r\nor thick, full of compartments or smooth and uniform. This is the\r\nonly fruit that Nature has enclosed in a covering formed of pieces\r\nsoldered together; the shell, in fact, forming a couple of boats, while\r\nthe kernel is divided into four separate compartments[1954] by the\r\nintervention of a ligneous membrane.\r\n\r\nIn all the other kinds, the fruit and the shell respectively are of\r\none solid piece, as we find the case with the hazel-nut,[1955] and\r\nanother variety of the nut formerly known as “Abellina,”[1956] from the\r\nname[1957] of the district in which it was first produced: it was first\r\nintroduced into Asia and Greece from Pontus, whence the name that is\r\nsometimes given to it—the “Pontic nut.” This nut, too, is protected by\r\na soft beard,[1958] but both the shell and the kernel are round, and\r\nformed of a single piece: these nuts are sometimes roasted.[1959] In\r\nthe middle of the kernel we find a germen or navel.\r\n\r\nA third class of nuts is the almond,[1960] which has an outer\r\ncovering, similar to that of the walnut, but thinner, with a second\r\ncoat in the shape of a shell. The kernel, however, is unlike that of\r\nthe walnut, in respect of its broad, flat shape, its firmness, and the\r\nsuperior tastiness of its flavour. It is a matter of doubt whether\r\nthis tree was in existence in Italy in the time of Cato; we find him\r\nspeaking of Greek nuts,[1961] but there are some persons who think\r\nthat these belong to the walnut class. He makes mention, also, of the\r\nhazel-nut, the calva,[1962] and the Prænestine[1963] nut, which last he\r\npraises beyond all others, and says[1964] that, put in pots, they may\r\nbe kept fresh and green by burying them in the earth.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, the almonds of Thasos and those of Alba are held\r\nin the highest esteem, as also two kinds that are grown at Tarentum,\r\none with a thin,[1965] brittle shell, and the other with a harder[1966]\r\none: these last are remarkably large, and of an oblong shape. There\r\nis the almond known as the “mollusca,”[1967] also, which breaks the\r\nshell of itself. There are some who would concede a highly honourable\r\ninterpretation to the name given to the walnut, and say that “juglans”\r\nmeans the “glans,” or “acorn of Jove.” It is only very lately that\r\nI heard a man of consular rank declare, that he then had in his\r\npossession walnut-trees that bore two[1968] crops in the year.\r\n\r\nOf the pistachio, which belongs also to the nut class, we have already\r\nspoken[1969] in its appropriate place: Vitellius introduced this tree\r\ninto Italy at the same time as the others that we mentioned;[1970]\r\nand Flaccus Pompeius, a Roman of Equestrian rank, who served with him,\r\nintroduced it at the same period into Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25. (23.)—EIGHTEEN VARIETIES OF THE CHESNUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe give the name of nut, too, to the chesnut,[1971] although it would\r\nseem more properly to belong to the acorn tribe. The chesnut has\r\nits armour of defence in a shell bristling with prickles like the\r\nhedge-hog, an envelope which in the acorn is only partially developed.\r\nIt is really surprising, however, that Nature should have taken such\r\npains thus to conceal an object of so little value. We sometimes find\r\nas many as three nuts beneath a single outer shell. The skin[1972] of\r\nthe nut is limp and flexible: there is a membrane, too, which lies next\r\nto the body of the fruit, and which, both in this and in the walnut,\r\nspoils the flavour if not taken off. Chesnuts are the most pleasant\r\neating when roasted:[1973] they are sometimes ground also, and are\r\neaten by women when fasting for religious scruples,[1974] as bearing\r\nsome resemblance to bread. It is from Sardes[1975] that the chesnut\r\nwas first introduced, and hence it is that the Greeks have given it\r\nthe name of the “Sardian acorn;” for the name “Dios balanon”[1976] was\r\ngiven at a later period, after it had been considerably improved by\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nAt the present day there are numerous varieties of the chesnut. Those\r\nof Tarentum are a light food, and by no means difficult of digestion;\r\nthey are of a flat shape. There is a rounder variety, known as the\r\n“balanitis;”[1977] it is very easily peeled, and springs clean out\r\nof the shell, so to say, of its own accord. The Salarian[1978]\r\nchesnut has a smooth outer shell, while that of Tarentum is not so\r\neasily handled.[1979] The Corellian is more highly esteemed, as is\r\nthe Etereian, which is an offshoot from it produced by a method upon\r\nwhich we shall have to enlarge when we come to speak of grafting.[1980]\r\nThis last has a red skin,[1981] which causes it to be preferred to the\r\nthree-cornered chesnut and our black common sorts, which are known\r\nas “coctivæ.”[1982] Tarentum and Neapolis in Campania are the most\r\nesteemed localities for the chesnut: other kinds, again, are grown to\r\nfeed pigs upon,[1983] the skin of which is rough and folded inwards, so\r\nas to penetrate to the heart of the kernel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26. (24.)—THE CAROB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carob,[1984] a fruit of remarkable sweetness, does not appear to be\r\nso very dissimilar to the chesnut, except that the skin[1985] is eaten\r\nas well as the inside. It is just the length of a finger, and about\r\nthe thickness of the thumb, being sometimes of a curved shape, like a\r\nsickle. The acorn cannot be reckoned in the number of the fruits; we\r\nshall, therefore, speak of it along with the trees of that class.[1986]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—THE FLESHY FRUITS. THE MULBERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other fruits belong to the fleshy kind, and differ both in the\r\nshape and the flesh. The flesh of the various berries,[1987] of the\r\nmulberry, and of the arbute, are quite different from one another—and\r\nthen what a difference, too, between the grape, which is only skin\r\nand juice,[1988] the myxa plum, and the flesh of some berries,[1989]\r\nsuch as the olive, for instance! In the flesh of the mulberry there\r\nis a juice of a vinous flavour, and the fruit assumes three different\r\ncolours, being at first white, then red, and ripe when black. The\r\nmulberry blossoms one of the very last,[1990] and yet is among the\r\nfirst to ripen: the juice of the fruit, when ripe, will stain the\r\nhands, but that of the unripe fruit will remove the marks. It is in\r\nthis tree that human ingenuity has effected the least improvement[1991]\r\nof all; there are no varieties here, no modifications effected by\r\ngrafting, nor, in fact, any other improvement except that the size of\r\nthe fruit, by careful management, has been increased. At Rome, there\r\nis a distinction made between the mulberries of Ostia and those of\r\nTusculum. A variety grows also on brambles, but the flesh of the fruit\r\nis of a very different nature.[1992]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—THE FRUIT OF THE ARBUTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the ground-strawberry[1993] is very different to that of\r\nthe arbute-tree,[1994] which is of a kindred kind: indeed, this is the\r\nonly instance in which we find a similar fruit growing upon a tree and\r\non the ground. The tree is tufted and bushy; the fruit takes a year\r\nto ripen, the blossoms of the young fruit flowering while that of the\r\npreceding year is arriving at maturity. Whether it is the male tree or\r\nthe female that is unproductive, authors are not generally agreed.\r\n\r\nThis is a fruit held in no esteem, in proof of which it has gained\r\nits name of “unedo,”[1995] people being generally content with eating\r\nbut one. The Greeks, however, have found for it two names—“comaron”\r\nand “memecylon,” from which it would appear[1996] that there are two\r\nvarieties. It has also with us another name besides that of “unedo,”\r\nbeing known also as the “arbutus.” Juba states that in Arabia this tree\r\nattains the height of fifty cubits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—THE RELATIVE NATURES OF BERRY FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference also among the various acinus fruits. First\r\nof all, among the grapes, we find considerable difference in respect\r\nto their firmness, the thinness or thickness of the skin, and the\r\nstone inside the fruit, which in some varieties is remarkably small,\r\nand in others even double in number: these last producing but very\r\nlittle juice. Very different, again, are the berries of the ivy[1997]\r\nand the elder;[1998] as also those in the pomegranate,[1999] these\r\nbeing the only ones that are of an angular shape. These last, also,\r\nhave not a membrane for each individual grain, but one to cover them\r\nall in common, and of a pale colour. All these fruits consist, too, of\r\njuice and flesh, and those more particularly which have but small seeds\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nThere are great varieties, too, among the berry[2000] fruits; the berry\r\nof the olive being quite different from that of the laurel, the berry\r\nof the lotus[2001] from that of the cornel, and that of the myrtle from\r\nthe berry of the lentisk. The berry, however, of the aquifolium[2002]\r\nand the thorn[2003] is quite destitute of juice.\r\n\r\nThe cherry[2004] occupies a middle place between the berry and the\r\nacinus fruit: it is white at first, which is the case also with nearly\r\nall the berries. From white, some of the berries pass to green, the\r\nolive and the laurel, for instance; while in the mulberry, the cherry,\r\nand the cornel, the change is to red; and then in some to black, as\r\nwith the mulberry, the cherry, and the olive, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30. (25.)—NINE VARIETIES OF THE CHERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cherry did not exist in Italy before the period of the victory\r\ngained over Mithridates by L. Lucullus, in the year of the City 680.\r\nHe was the first to introduce this tree from Pontus, and now, in the\r\ncourse of one hundred and twenty years, it has travelled beyond the\r\nOcean, and arrived in Britannia even. The cherry, as we have already\r\nstated,[2005] in spite of every care, it has been found impossible\r\nto rear in Egypt. Of this fruit, that known as the “Apronian”[2006]\r\nis the reddest variety, the Lutatian[2007] being the blackest, and\r\nthe Cæcilian[2008] perfectly round. The Junian[2009] cherry has an\r\nagreeable flavour, but only, so to say, when eaten beneath the tree,\r\nas they are so remarkably delicate that they will not bear carrying.\r\nThe highest rank, however, has been awarded to the duracinus[2010]\r\nvariety, known in Campania as the “Plinian”[2011] cherry, and in\r\nBelgica to the Lusitanian[2012] cherry, as also to one that grows on\r\nthe banks of the Rhenus. This last kind has a third colour, being a\r\nmixture[2013] of black, red, and green, and has always the appearance\r\nof being just on the turn to ripening. It is less than five years since\r\nthe kind known as the “laurel-cherry” was introduced, of a bitter but\r\nnot unpleasant flavour, the produce of a graft[2014] upon the laurel.\r\nThe Macedonian cherry grows on a tree that is very small,[2015] and\r\nrarely exceeds three cubits in height; while the chamæcerasus[2016] is\r\nstill smaller, being but a mere shrub. The cherry is one of the first\r\ntrees to recompense the cultivator with its yearly growth; it loves\r\ncold localities and a site exposed to the north.[2017] The fruit are\r\nsometimes dried in the sun, and preserved, like olives, in casks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31. (26.)—THE CORNEL. THE LENTISK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same degree of care is expended also on the cultivation of the\r\ncornel[2018] and the lentisk;[2019] that it may not be thought,\r\nforsooth, that there is anything that was not made for the craving\r\nappetite of man! Various flavours are blended together, and one is\r\ncompelled to please our palates by the aid of another—hence it is\r\nthat the produce of different lands and various climates are so\r\noften mingled with one another. For one kind of food it is India\r\nthat we summon to our aid, and then for another we lay Egypt under\r\ncontribution, or else Crete, or Cyrene, every country, in fact: no,\r\nnor does man stick at poisons[2020] even, if he can only gratify his\r\nlonging to devour everything: a thing that will be still more evident\r\nwhen we come to treat of the nature of herbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (27.)—THIRTEEN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS OF JUICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile upon this subject, it may be as well to state that there are\r\nno less than thirteen different flavours[2021] belonging in common\r\nto the fruits and the various juices: the sweet, the luscious, the\r\nunctuous, the bitter, the rough, the acrid,[2022] the pungent, the\r\nsharp, the sour, and the salt; in addition to which, there are three\r\nother kinds of flavours of a nature that is truly singular. The first\r\nof these last kinds is that flavour in which several other flavours\r\nare united, as in wine, for instance; for in it we are sensible of the\r\nrough, the pungent,[2023] and the luscious, all at the same moment,\r\nand all of them flavours that belong to other substances. The second\r\nof these flavours is that in which we are sensible at the same instant\r\nof a flavour that belongs to another substance, and yet of one that is\r\npeculiar to the individual object of which we are tasting, such as that\r\nof milk, for instance: indeed, in milk we cannot correctly say that\r\nthere is any pronounced flavour that is either sweet, or unctuous, or\r\nluscious, a sort of smooth taste[2024] in the mouth being predominant,\r\nwhich holds the place of a more decided flavour. The third instance\r\nis that of water, which has no flavour whatever, nor, indeed, any\r\nflavouring principle;[2025] but still, this very absence of flavour\r\nis considered as constituting one of them, and forming a peculiar\r\nclass[2026] of itself; so much so, indeed, that if in water any taste\r\nor flavouring principle is detected, it is looked upon as impure.\r\n\r\nIn the perception of all these various flavours the smell plays a very\r\nconsiderable[2027] part, there being a very great affinity between\r\nthem. Water, however, is properly quite inodorous: and if the least\r\nsmell is to be perceived, it is not pure water. It is a singular thing\r\nthat three of the principal elements[2028] of Nature—water, air, and\r\nfire—should have neither taste nor smell, nor, indeed, any flavouring\r\nprinciple whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33. (28.)—THE COLOUR AND SMELL OF JUICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the juices, those of a vinous[2029] flavour belong to the pear,\r\nthe mulberry, and the myrtle, and not to the grape, a very singular\r\nfact. An unctuous taste is detected in the olive,[2030] the laurel,\r\nthe walnut, and the almond; sweetness exists in the grape, the fig,\r\nand the date; while in the plum class we find a watery[2031] juice.\r\nThere is a considerable difference, too, in the colours assumed by the\r\nvarious juices. That of the mulberry, the cherry, the cornel, and the\r\nblack grape resembles the colour of blood, while in the white grape\r\nthe juice is white. The humour found in the summit of the fig[2032]\r\nis of a milky nature, but not so with the juice found in the body of\r\nthe fruit. In the apple it is the colour of foam,[2033] while in the\r\npeach it is perfectly colourless, and this is the case, too, with the\r\nduracinus,[2034] which abounds in juice; for who can say that he has\r\never detected any colour in it?\r\n\r\nSmell, too, presents its own peculiar marvels; in the apple it is\r\npungent,[2035] and it is weak in the peach, while in the sweet[2036]\r\nfruits we perceive none at all: so, too, the sweet wines are inodorous,\r\nwhile the thinner ones have more aroma, and are much sooner fit for\r\nuse than those of a thicker nature.[2037] The odoriferous fruits\r\nare not pleasing to the palate in the same degree, seeing that the\r\nflavour[2038] of them does not come up to their smell: hence it is that\r\nin the citron we find the smell so extremely penetrating,[2039] and\r\nthe taste sour in the highest degree. Sometimes the smell is of a more\r\ndelicate[2040] nature, as in the quince, for instance; while the fig\r\nhas no odour whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—THE VARIOUS NATURES OF FRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus much, then, for the various classes and kinds of fruit: it will\r\nbe as well now to classify their various natures within a more limited\r\nscope. Some fruits grow in a pod which is sweet itself, and contains a\r\nbitter seed: whereas in most kinds of fruit the seed is agreeable to\r\nthe palate, those which grow in a pod are condemned. Other fruits are\r\nberries, with the stone within and the flesh without, as in the olive\r\nand the cherry: others, again, have the berry within and the stone\r\nwithout, the case, as we have already stated, with the berries that\r\ngrow in Egypt.[2041]\r\n\r\nThose fruits, known as “pomes” have the same characteristics as the\r\nberry fruits; in some of them we find the body of the fruit within and\r\nthe shell without, as in the nut, for example; others, again, have the\r\nmeat of the fruit without and the shell within, the peach and the plum,\r\nfor instance: the refuse part being thus surrounded with the flesh,\r\nwhile in other fruits the flesh is surrounded by the refuse part.[2042]\r\nNuts are enclosed in a shell, chesnuts in a skin; in chesnuts the skin\r\nis taken off, but in medlars it is eaten with the rest. Acorns are\r\ncovered with a crust, grapes with a husk, and pomegranates with a skin\r\nand an inner membrane. The mulberry is composed of flesh and juice,\r\nwhile the cherry consists of juice and skin. In some fruits the flesh\r\nseparates easily from the woody part, the walnut and the date, for\r\ninstance; in others it adheres, as in the case of the olive and the\r\nlaurel berry: some kinds, again, partake of both natures, the peach,\r\nfor example; for in the duracinus[2043] kind the flesh adheres to the\r\nstone, and cannot be torn away from it, while in the other sorts they\r\nare easily separated. In some fruits there is no stone or shell[2044]\r\neither within or without, one variety of the date,[2045] for instance.\r\nIn some kinds, again, the shell is eaten, just the same as the fruit;\r\nthis we have already mentioned as being the case with a variety of the\r\nalmond found in Egypt.[2046] Some fruits have on the outside a twofold\r\nrefuse covering, the chesnut, the almond, and the walnut, for example.\r\nSome, again, are composed of three separate parts—the body of the\r\nfruit, then a woody shell, and inside of that a kernel, as in the peach.\r\n\r\nSome fruits grow closely packed together, such as grapes and sorbs:\r\nthese last, just like so many grapes in a cluster, cling round the\r\nbranch and bend it downwards with their weight. On the other hand, some\r\nfruits grow separately, at a distance from one another; this is the\r\ncase with the peach. Some fruits are enclosed in a sort of matrix, as\r\nwith the grains of the pomegranate: some hang down from a stalk, such\r\nas the pear, for instance: others hang in clusters, grapes and dates,\r\nfor example. Others, again, grow upon stalks and bunches united: this\r\nwe find the case with the berries of the ivy and the elder. Some adhere\r\nclose to the branches, like the laurel berry, while other varieties\r\nlie close to the branch or hang from it, as the case may be: thus we\r\nfind in the olive some fruit with short stalks, and others with long.\r\nSome fruits grow with a little calyx at the top, the pomegranate, for\r\nexample, the medlar, and the lotus[2047] of Egypt and the Euphrates.\r\n\r\nThen, too, as to the various parts of fruit, they are held in different\r\ndegrees of esteem according to their respective recommendations. In the\r\ndate it is the flesh that is usually liked, in those of Thebais it is\r\nthe crust;[2048] the grape and the caryota date are esteemed for their\r\njuice, the pear and the apple for their firmness, the melimelum[2049]\r\nfor its soft meat, the mulberry for its cartilaginous consistency, and\r\nnuts for their kernels. Some fruits in Egypt are esteemed for their\r\nskin; the carica,[2050] for instance. This skin, which in the green fig\r\nis thrown away as so much refuse peeling, when the fig is dried is very\r\nhighly esteemed. In the papyrus,[2051] the ferula,[2052] and the white\r\nthorn[2053] the stalk itself constitutes the fruit, and the shoots of\r\nthe fig-tree[2054] are similarly employed.\r\n\r\nAmong the shrubs, the fruit of the caper[2055] is eaten along with the\r\nstalk; and in the carob,[2056] what is the part that is eaten but so\r\nmuch wood? Nor ought we to omit one peculiarity that exists in the seed\r\nof this fruit—it can be called neither flesh, wood, nor cartilage, and\r\nyet no other name has been found for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35. (29).—THE MYRTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of the juices that are found in the myrtle are particularly\r\nremarkable, for it is the only one[2057] of all the trees, the berries\r\nof which produce two kinds of oil[2058] as well as of wine, besides\r\nmyrtidanum,[2059] of which we have already spoken. The berry of this\r\nwas also put to another use in ancient times, for before pepper[2060]\r\nwas known it was employed in place of it as a seasoning; so much so,\r\nindeed, that a name has been derived from it for the highly-seasoned\r\ndish which to this day is known by the name of “myrtatum.”[2061] It is\r\nby the aid of these berries, too, that the flavour of the flesh of the\r\nwild boar is improved, and they generally form one of the ingredients\r\nin the flavouring of our sauces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—HISTORICAL ANECDOTES RELATIVE TO THE MYRTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree was seen for the first time in the regions of Europe, which\r\ncommence on this side of the Ceraunian mountains,[2062] growing at\r\nCirceii,[2063] near the tomb of Elpenor there:[2064] it still retains\r\nits Greek[2065] name, which clearly proves it to be an exotic. There\r\nwere myrtles growing on the site now occupied by Rome, at the time of\r\nits foundation; for a tradition exists to the effect that the Romans\r\nand the Sabines, after they had intended fighting, on account of the\r\nvirgins who had been ravished by the former, purified themselves, first\r\nlaying down their arms, with sprigs of myrtle, on the very same spot\r\nwhich is now occupied by the statues of Venus Cluacina; for in the\r\nancient language “cluere” means to purify.\r\n\r\nThis tree is employed, too, for a species of fumigation;[2066] being\r\nselected for that purpose, because Venus, who presides over all\r\nunions, is the tutelary divinity of the tree.[2067] I am not quite\r\nsure, too, whether this tree was not the very first that was planted\r\nin the public places of Rome, the result of some ominous presage by\r\nthe augurs of wondrous import. For at the Temple of Quirinus, or, in\r\nother words, of Romulus himself, one of the most ancient in Rome, there\r\nwere formerly two myrtle-trees, which grew for a long period just\r\nin front of the temple; one of these was called the Patrician tree,\r\nthe other the Plebeian. The Patrician myrtle was for many years the\r\nsuperior tree, full of sap and vigour; indeed, so long as the Senate\r\nmaintained its superiority, so did the tree, being of large growth,\r\nwhile the Plebeian tree presented a meagre, shrivelled appearance. In\r\nlater times, however, the latter tree gained the superiority, and the\r\nPatrician myrtle began to fail just at the period of the[2068] Marsic\r\nWar,[2069] when the power of the Senate was so greatly weakened: and\r\nlittle by little did this once majestic tree sink into a state of\r\nutter exhaustion and sterility. There was an ancient altar[2070] also,\r\nconsecrated to Venus Myrtea, known at the present day by the name of\r\nMurcia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—ELEVEN VARIETIES OF THE MYRTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCato[2071] makes mention of three varieties of the myrtle, the black,\r\nwhite, and the conjugula, perhaps so called from its reference to\r\nconjugal unions, and belonging to the same species as that which grew\r\nwhere Cluacina’s statues now stand: at the present day the varieties\r\nare differently distinguished into the cultivated and the wild[2072]\r\nmyrtle, each of which includes a kind with a large leaf. The kind\r\nknown as “oxymyrsine,”[2073] belongs only to the wild variety:\r\nornamental gardeners classify several varieties of the cultivated\r\nkind; the “Tarentine,”[2074] they speak of as a myrtle with a small\r\nleaf, the myrtle of this country[2075] as having a broad leaf, and the\r\nhexasticha[2076] as being very thickly covered with leaves, growing in\r\nrows of six: it is not, however, made any use of. There are two other\r\nkinds, that are branchy and well covered. In my opinion, the conjugula\r\nis the same that is now called the Roman myrtle. It is in Egypt that\r\nthe myrtle is most odoriferous.\r\n\r\nCato[2077] has taught us how to make a wine from the black myrtle, by\r\ndrying it thoroughly in the shade, and then putting it in must: he\r\nsays, also, that if the berries are not quite dry, it will produce an\r\noil. Since his time a method has been discovered of making a pale wine\r\nfrom the white variety; two sextarii of pounded myrtle are steeped\r\nin three semi-sextarii of wine, and the mixture is then subjected to\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe leaves[2078] also are dried by themselves till they are capable of\r\nbeing reduced to a powder, which is used for the treatment of sores on\r\nthe human body: this powder is of a slightly corrosive nature, and is\r\nemployed also for the purpose of checking the perspiration. A thing\r\nthat is still more remarkable, this oil is possessed of a certain\r\nvinous flavour, being, at the same time, of an unctuous nature, and\r\nremarkably efficacious for improving[2079] wines. When this is done,\r\nthe wine strainer[2080] is dipped in the oil before it is used, the\r\nresult of which is that it retains the lees of the wine, and allows\r\nnothing but the pure liquor to escape, while at the same time it\r\naccompanies the wine and causes a marked improvement in its flavour.\r\n\r\nSprigs of myrtle, if carried by a person when travelling on foot,\r\nare found to be very refreshing[2081] on a long journey. Rings, too,\r\nmade of myrtle which has never been touched by iron, are an excellent\r\nspecific for swellings in the groin.[2082]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—THE MYRTLE USED AT ROME IN OVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe myrtle has played[2083] its part, also, in the successes of war.\r\nPosthumius Tubertus, who gained a victory over the Sabines in his\r\nconsulship,[2084] was the first person who entered the City enjoying\r\nthe honour of an ovation,[2085] for having achieved this success with\r\nease and without bloodshed: upon which occasion he made his entry\r\ncrowned with the myrtle of Venus Victrix, and thereby rendered her\r\ntree an object of regard[2086] to our enemies even. Ever since this\r\noccasion, the wreath of those who have enjoyed an ovation has been\r\nmade of myrtle, with the exception of M. Crassus,[2087] who, on his\r\nvictory over the fugitive slaves and Spartacus, made his entry crowned\r\nwith laurels. Massurius informs us, also, that some generals, on\r\nthe occasion of a triumph even, have worn a wreath of myrtle in the\r\ntriumphal car. L. Piso states that Papirius Maso, who was the first\r\nto enjoy a triumph for a victory over the Marsi—it was on the Alban\r\nMount[2088]—was in the habit of attending at the games of the Circus,\r\nwearing a wreath of myrtle: he was the maternal grandfather of the\r\nsecond Scipio Africanus. Marcus Valerius[2089] wore two wreaths, one of\r\nlaurel, the other of myrtle; it was in consequence of a vow which he\r\nhad made to that effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39. (30.)—THE LAUREL; THIRTEEN VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laurel is especially consecrated to triumphs, is remarkably\r\nornamental to houses, and guards the portals of our emperors[2090]\r\nand our pontiffs: there suspended alone, it graces the palace, and is\r\never on guard before the threshold. Cato[2091] speaks of two varieties\r\nof this tree, the Delphic[2092] and the Cyprian. Pompeius Lenæus has\r\nadded another, to which he has given the name of “mustax,” from the\r\ncircumstance of its being used for putting under the cake known by\r\nthe name of “mustaceum”.[2093] He says that this variety has a very\r\nlarge leaf, flaccid, and of a whitish hue; that the Delphic laurel is\r\nof one uniform colour, greener than the other, with berries of very\r\nlarge size, and of a red tint approaching to green. He says, too, that\r\nit is with this laurel that the victors at Delphi[2094] are crowned,\r\nand warriors who enjoy the honours of a triumph at Rome. The Cyprian\r\nlaurel, he says, has a short leaf, is of a blackish colour, with an\r\nimbricated[2095] edge, and crisped.\r\n\r\nSince his time, however, the varieties have considerably augmented.\r\nThere is the tinus[2096] for instance, by some considered as a species\r\nof wild laurel, while others, again, regard it as a tree of a separate\r\nclass; indeed, it does differ from the laurel as to the colour, the\r\nberry being of an azure blue. The royal[2097] laurel, too, has since\r\nbeen added, which has of late begun to be known as the “Augustan:”\r\nboth the tree, as well as the leaf, are of remarkable size, and the\r\nberries have not the usual rough taste. Some say, however, that the\r\nroyal laurel and the Augustan are not the same tree, and make out the\r\nformer to be a peculiar kind, with a leaf both longer and broader than\r\nthat of the Augustan. The same authors, also, make a peculiar species\r\nof the bacalia the commonest laurel of all, and the one that bears the\r\ngreatest number of berries. With them, too, the barren laurel[2098]\r\nis the laurel of the triumphs, and they say that this is the one that\r\nis used by warriors when enjoying a triumph—a thing that surprises me\r\nvery much; unless, indeed, the use of it was first introduced by the\r\nlate Emperor Augustus, and it is to be considered as the progeny of\r\nthat laurel, which, as we shall just now have occasion to mention, was\r\nsent to him from heaven; it being the smallest of them all, with a\r\ncrisped[2099] short leaf, and very rarely to be met with.\r\n\r\nIn ornamental gardening we also find the taxa[2100] employed, with\r\na small leaf sprouting from the middle of the leaf, and forming a\r\nfringe, as it were, hanging from it; the spadonia,[2101] too, without\r\nthis fringe, a tree that thrives remarkably well in the shade: indeed,\r\nhowever dense the shade may be, it will soon cover the spot with its\r\nshoots. There is the chamædaphne,[2102] also, a shrub that grows wild;\r\nthe Alexandrian[2103] laurel, by some known as the Idean, by others\r\nas the “hypoglottion,”[2104] by others as the “carpophyllon,”[2105]\r\nand by others, again, as the “hypelates.”[2106] From the root it\r\nthrows out branches three quarters of a foot in length; it is much\r\nused in ornamental gardening, and for making wreaths, and it has a\r\nmore pointed leaf than that of the myrtle, and superior to it in\r\nsoftness, whiteness, and size: the seed, which lies between the leaves,\r\nis red. This last kind grows in great abundance on Mount Ida and in\r\nthe vicinity of Heraclea in Pontus: it is only found, however, in\r\nmountainous districts.\r\n\r\nThe laurel, too, known as the daphnoides,[2107] is a variety\r\nthat has received many different names: by some it is called the\r\nPelasgian laurel, by others the euthalon, and by others the stephanon\r\nAlexandri.[2108] This is also a branchy shrub, with a thicker and\r\nsofter leaf than that of the ordinary laurel: if tasted, it leaves\r\na burning sensation in the mouth and throat: the berries are red,\r\ninclining to black. The ancient writers have remarked, that in their\r\ntime there was no species of laurel in the island of Corsica. Since\r\nthen, however, it has been planted there, and has thrived well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—HISTORICAL ANECDOTES CONNECTED WITH THE LAUREL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree is emblematical of peace:[2109] when a branch of it is\r\nextended, it is to denote a truce between enemies in arms. For the\r\nRomans more particularly it is the messenger of joyful tidings, and of\r\nvictory: it accompanies the despatches[2110] of the general, and it\r\ndecorates the lances and javelins of the soldiers and the fasces which\r\nprecede their chief. It is of this tree that branches are deposited on\r\nthe lap of Jupiter All-good and All-great,[2111] so often as some new\r\nvictory has imparted universal gladness. This is done, not because\r\nit is always green, nor yet because it is an emblem of peace—for in\r\nboth of those respects the olive would take the precedence of it—but\r\nbecause it is the most beauteous tree on Mount Parnassus, and was\r\npleasing for its gracefulness to Apollo even; a deity to whom the kings\r\nof Rome sent offerings at an early period, as we learn from the case\r\nof L. Brutus.[2112] Perhaps, too, honour is more particularly paid\r\nto this tree because it was there that Brutus[2113] earned the glory\r\nof asserting his country’s liberties, when, by the direction of the\r\noracle, he kissed that laurel-bearing soil. Another reason, too, may be\r\nthe fact, that of all the shrubs that are planted and received in our\r\nhouses, this is the only one that is never struck by lightning.[2114]\r\nIt is for these reasons, in my opinion, that the post of honour has\r\nbeen awarded to the laurel more particularly in triumphs, and not, as\r\nMassurius says, because it was used for the purposes of fumigation and\r\npurification from the blood of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above particulars, it is not permitted to defile\r\nthe laurel and the olive by applying them to profane uses; so much\r\nso, indeed, that, not even for the propitiation of the divinities,\r\nshould a fire be lighted with them at either altar or shrine.[2115]\r\nIndeed, it is very evident that the laurel protests against such usage\r\nby crackling[2116] as it does in the fire, thus, in a manner, giving\r\nexpression to its abhorrence of such treatment. The wood of this tree\r\nwhen eaten is good as a specific for internal maladies and affections\r\nof the sinews.[2117]\r\n\r\nIt is said that when it thundered, the Emperor Tiberius was in the\r\nhabit of putting on a wreath of laurel to allay his apprehensions\r\nof disastrous effects from the lightning.[2118] There are also some\r\nremarkable facts connected with the laurel in the history of the late\r\nEmperor Augustus: once while Livia Drusilla, who afterwards on her\r\nmarriage with the Emperor assumed the name of Augusta, at the time\r\nthat she was affianced to him, was seated, there fell into her lap\r\na hen of remarkable whiteness, which an eagle let fall from aloft\r\nwithout its receiving the slightest injury: on Livia viewing it without\r\nany symptoms of alarm, it was discovered that miracle was added to\r\nmiracle, and that it held in its beak a branch of laurel covered\r\nwith berries. The aruspices gave orders that the hen and her progeny\r\nshould be carefully preserved, and the branch planted and tended\r\nwith religious care. This was accordingly done at the country-house\r\nbelonging to the Cæsars, on the Flaminian Way, near the banks of the\r\nTiber, eight miles from the City; from which circumstance that road has\r\nsince received the title “Ad gallinas.”[2119] From the branch there\r\nhas now arisen, wondrous to relate, quite a grove: and Augustus Cæsar\r\nafterwards, when celebrating a triumph, held a branch of it in his\r\nhand and wore a wreath of this laurel on his head; since which time\r\nall the succeeding emperors have followed his example. Hence, too, has\r\noriginated the custom of planting the branches which they have held on\r\nthese occasions, and we thus see groves of laurel still existing which\r\nowe their respective names to this circumstance. It was on the above\r\noccasion, too, that not improbably a change was effected in the usual\r\nlaurel of the triumph.[2120] The laurel is the only one among the trees\r\nthat in the Latin language has given an appellation to a man,[2121]\r\nand it is the only one the leaf of which has a distinct name of its\r\nown,—it being known by the name of “laurea.” The name of this tree is\r\nstill retained by one place in the city of Rome, for we find a spot\r\non the Aventine Mount still known by the name of “Loretum,”[2122]\r\nwhere formerly a laurel-grove existed. The laurel is employed in\r\npurifications, and we may here mention, incidentally, that it will grow\r\nfrom slips[2123]—though Democritus and Theophrastus have expressed\r\ntheir doubts as to that fact.\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed to speak of the forest trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, one\r\nhundred and twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Fenestella,[2124] Fabianus,[2125] Virgil,[2126]\r\nCorn.

The next thing, then, would be\r\nto speak of the glandiferous trees, the trees which proffered the\r\nearliest nutriment to the appetite of man, and proved themselves his\r\nfoster-mothers in his forlorn and savage state—did I not feel myself\r\nconstrained on this occasion to make some mention of the surprise which\r\nI have felt on finding by actual experience what is the life of mortals\r\nwhen they inhabit a country that is without either tree or shrub.\r\n\r\n(1.) I have already stated[2192] that in the East many nations that\r\ndwell on the shores of the ocean are placed in this necessitous\r\nstate; and I myself have personally witnessed the condition of the\r\nChauci,[2193] both the Greater and the Lesser, situate in the regions\r\nof the far North. In those climates a vast tract of land, invaded\r\ntwice each day and night by the overflowing waves of the ocean, opens\r\na question that is eternally proposed to us by Nature, whether these\r\nregions are to be looked upon as belonging to the land, or whether as\r\nforming a portion of the sea?\r\n\r\nHere a wretched race is found, inhabiting either the more elevated\r\nspots of land, or else eminences artificially constructed, and of a\r\nheight to which they know by experience that the highest tides will\r\nnever reach. Here they pitch their cabins; and when the waves cover\r\nthe surrounding country far and wide, like so many mariners on board\r\nship are they: when, again, the tide recedes, their condition is that\r\nof so many shipwrecked men, and around their cottages they pursue\r\nthe fishes as they make their escape with the receding tide. It is\r\nnot their lot, like the adjoining nations, to keep any flocks for\r\nsustenance by their milk, nor even to maintain a warfare with wild\r\nbeasts, every shrub, even, being banished afar. With the sedge[2194]\r\nand the rushes of the marsh they make cords, and with these they\r\nweave the nets employed in the capture of the fish; they fashion the\r\nmud,[2195] too, with their hands, and drying it by the help of the\r\nwinds more than of the sun, cook their food by its aid, and so warm\r\ntheir entrails, frozen as they are by the northern blasts; their\r\nonly[2196] drink, too, is rain-water, which they collect in holes dug\r\nat the entrance of their abode: and yet these nations, if this very day\r\nthey were vanquished by the Roman people, would exclaim against being\r\nreduced[2197] to slavery! Be it so, then—Fortune is most kind to many,\r\njust when she means to punish them.[2198]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—WONDERS CONNECTED WITH TREES IN THE NORTHERN REGIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother marvel, too, connected with the forests! They cover all\r\nthe rest of Germany, and by their shade augment the cold. But the\r\nhighest of them all are those not far distant from the Chauci already\r\nmentioned, and more particularly in the vicinity of the two lakes[2199]\r\nthere. The very shores are lined with oaks,[2200] which manifest an\r\nextraordinary eagerness to attain their growth: undermined by the\r\nwaves or uprooted by the blasts, with their entwining roots they carry\r\nvast forests along with them, and, thus balanced, stand upright as\r\nthey float along, while they spread afar their huge branches like\r\nthe rigging of so many ships. Many is the time that these trees have\r\nstruck our fleets with alarm, when the waves have driven them, almost\r\npurposely it would seem, against their prows as they stood at anchor in\r\nthe night; and the men, destitute of all remedy and resource, have had\r\nto engage in a naval combat with a forest of trees!\r\n\r\n(2.) In the same northern regions, too, is the Hercynian[2201] Forest,\r\nwhose gigantic oaks,[2202] uninjured by the lapse of ages, and\r\ncontemporary with the creation of the world, by their near approach\r\nto immortality surpass all other marvels known. Not to speak of other\r\nmatters that would surpass all belief, it is a well-known fact that\r\ntheir roots,[2203] as they meet together, upheave vast hills; or, if\r\nthe earth happens not to accumulate with them, rise aloft to the very\r\nbranches even, and, as they contend for the mastery, form arcades, like\r\nso many portals thrown open, and large enough to admit of the passage\r\nof a squadron of horse.\r\n\r\n(3.) All these trees, in general, belong to the glandiferous\r\nclass,[2204] and have ever been held in the highest honour by the Roman\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (4.)—THE ACORN OAK. THE CIVIC CROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with the leaves of this class of trees that our civic crown\r\nis made, the most glorious reward that can be bestowed on military\r\nvalour, and, for this long time past, the emblem of the imperial[2205]\r\nclemency; since the time, in fact, when, after the impiety of civil\r\nwar, it was first deemed a meritorious action not to shed the blood\r\nof a fellow-citizen. Far inferior to this in rank are the mural[2206]\r\ncrown, the vallar,[2207] and the golden[2208] one, superior though\r\nthey may be in the value of the material: inferior, too, in merit,\r\nis the rostrate[2209] crown, though ennobled, in recent times more\r\nparticularly, by two great names, those of M. Varro,[2210] who was\r\npresented with it by Pompeius Magnus, for his great achievements in the\r\nPiratic War, and of M. Agrippa, on whom it was bestowed by Cæsar, at\r\nthe end of the Sicilian War, which was also a war against pirates.\r\n\r\nIn former days the beaks[2211] of vessels, fastened in front of the\r\ntribunal, graced the Forum, and seemed, as it were, a crown placed\r\nupon the head of the Roman people itself. In later times, however,\r\nthey began to be polluted and trodden under foot amid the seditious\r\nmovements of the tribunes, the public interest was sacrificed to\r\nprivate advantage, each citizen sought solely his own advancement, and\r\neverything looked upon as holy was abandoned to profanation—still, from\r\namid all this, the Rostra[2212] emerged once again, and passed from\r\nbeneath the feet of the citizens to their heads. Augustus presented\r\nto Agrippa the rostrate crown, while he himself received the civic\r\ncrown[2213] at the hands of all mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—THE ORIGIN OF THE PRESENTATION OF CROWNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ancient times crowns[2214] were presented to none but a divinity,\r\nhence it is that Homer[2215] awards them only to the gods of heaven\r\nand to the entire army; but never to an individual, however great his\r\nachievements in battle may have been. It is said, too, that Father\r\nLiber was the first of all who placed a crown on his head, and that it\r\nwas made of ivy.[2216] In succeeding times, those engaged in sacrifices\r\nin honour of the gods began to wear them, the victims being decked\r\nwith wreaths as well. More recently, again, they were employed in the\r\nsacred games;[2217] and at the present day they are bestowed on such\r\noccasions, not upon the victor, indeed, but upon his country, which\r\nreceives, it is proclaimed, this crown at his hands.[2218] Hence arose\r\nthe usage of conferring wreaths upon warriors when about to enjoy a\r\ntriumph, for them to consecrate in the temples: after which it became\r\nthe custom to present them at our games. It would be a lengthy matter,\r\nand, indeed, foreign to the purpose of this work, to enter upon a\r\ndiscussion who was the first Roman that received each kind of crown;\r\nin fact, they were acquainted with none but such as were given as the\r\nreward of military prowess. It is a well-known fact, however, that this\r\npeople has more varieties of crowns than those of all other nations put\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5.—PERSONS PRESENTED WITH A CROWN OF LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRomulus presented Hostus Hostilius[2219] with a crown of leaves, for\r\nbeing the first to enter Fidenæ. This Hostus was the grandfather of\r\nKing Tullus Hostilius. P. Decius the elder, the military tribune, was\r\npresented with a crown of leaves by the army which had been saved by\r\nhis valour, under the command of Cornelius Cossus,[2220] the consul,\r\nin the war with the Samnites. This crown was made at first of the\r\nleaves of the holm oak, but afterwards those of the æsculus[2221] were\r\npreferred, as being a tree sacred to Jupiter: this, however, was soon\r\nemployed indifferently with the quercus, according as each might\r\nhappen to present itself, the honourable distinction given to the acorn\r\nbeing the only thing observed. Rigorous laws were, however, enacted,\r\nto maintain the lofty glories of this wreath, by which it was placed\r\nupon an equality even with the supreme honours of the wreath that is\r\ngiven by Greece in presence of Jove[2222] himself, and to receive\r\nwhich the exulting city of the victor is wont to break[2223] a passage\r\nthrough its very walls. These laws are to the effect that the life of\r\na fellow-citizen must be preserved, and an enemy slain; that the spot\r\nwhere this takes place must have been held by the enemy that same day;\r\nthat the person saved shall admit the fact, other witnesses being of no\r\nuse at all; and that the person saved shall have been a Roman citizen.\r\n\r\nTo preserve an ally merely, even though it should be the life of a\r\nking that is so saved, confers no right to this high reward, nor is\r\nthe honour at all increased, even if it is the Roman general that has\r\nbeen thus preserved, it being the intention of the framers of the law\r\nthat it should be the status of the citizen that is everything. When a\r\nman has received this wreath, it is his privilege to wear it for the\r\nrest of his life. When he makes his appearance at the celebration of\r\nthe games,[2224] it is customary for the Senate even to rise from their\r\nseats, and he has the right of taking his seat next to the senators.\r\nExemption, too, from all civic duties is conferred upon him as well\r\nas his father and his father’s father. Siccius Dentatus, as we have\r\nalready mentioned[2225] on an appropriate occasion, received fourteen\r\ncivic crowns, and Manlius Capitolinus[2226] six,[2227] one, among the\r\nrest, for having saved the life of his general, Servilius. Scipio\r\nAfricanus declined to accept the civic crown for having saved the life\r\nof his father at the battle of Trebia. Times these, right worthy of\r\nour everlasting admiration, which accorded honour alone as the reward\r\nof exploits so mighty, and which, while other crowns were recommended\r\nby being made of gold, disdained to set a price upon the safety of a\r\ncitizen, and loudly proclaimed thereby that it is unrighteous to save\r\nthe life of a man for motives of lucre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (5.)—THIRTEEN VARIETIES OF THE ACORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that acorns[2228] at this very day constitute\r\nthe wealth of many nations, and that, too, even amid these times of\r\npeace. Sometimes, also, when there is a scarcity of corn they are dried\r\nand ground, the meal being employed for making a kind of bread. Even\r\nto this very day, in the provinces of Spain,[2229] we find the acorn\r\nintroduced at table in the second course: it is thought to be sweeter\r\nwhen roasted in the ashes. By the law of the Twelve Tables, there is a\r\nprovision made that it shall be lawful for a man to gather his acorns\r\nwhen they have fallen upon the land of another.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the glandiferous trees are numerous, and they are\r\nfound to differ in fruit, locality, sex, and taste; the acorn of the\r\nbeech having one shape, that of the quercus another, and that, again,\r\nof the holm-oak another. The various species also, among themselves,\r\noffer a considerable number of varieties. In addition to this, some\r\nof these trees are of a wild nature, while the fruits of others are\r\nof a less acrid flavour, owing to a more careful cultivation. Then,\r\ntoo, there is a difference between the varieties which grow on the\r\nmountains and those of the plains; the males differ from the females,\r\nand there are considerable modifications in the flavour of their fruit.\r\nThat of the beech[2230] is the sweetest of all; so much so, that,\r\naccording to Cornelius Alexander, the people of the city of Chios,\r\nwhen besieged, supported themselves wholly on mast. The different\r\nvarieties cannot possibly be distinguished by their respective names,\r\nwhich vary according to their several localities. The quercus[2231]\r\nand the robur[2232] we see growing everywhere, but not so with the\r\næsculus;[2233] while a fourth kind, known as the cerrus,[2234] is\r\nnot so much as known throughout the greater part of Italy. We shall\r\ndistinguish them, therefore, by their characteristic features, and when\r\ncircumstances render it necessary, shall give their Greek names as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (6.)—THE BEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acorn of the beech[2235] is similar in appearance to a kernel,\r\nenclosed in a shell of triangular shape. The leaf is thin and one of\r\nthe very lightest, is similar in appearance to that of the poplar, and\r\nturns yellow with remarkable rapidity. From the middle of the leaf,\r\nand upon the upper side of it, there mostly shoots a little green\r\nberry, with a pointed top.[2236] The beech is particularly agreeable\r\nto rats and mice; and hence it is, that where this tree abounds, those\r\ncreatures are sure to be plentiful also. The leaves are also very\r\nfattening for dormice, and good for thrushes too. Almost all trees bear\r\nan average crop but once in two years; this is the case with the beech\r\nmore particularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—THE OTHER ACORNS—WOOD FOR FUEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other trees that bear acorns, properly so called, are the robur,\r\nthe æsculus, the cerrus, the holm-oak,[2237] and the cork-tree:[2238]\r\nit is contained in a rivelled calyx, which embraces more or less of it,\r\naccording to the several varieties. The leaves of these trees, those\r\nof the holm-oak excepted, are weighty, pulpy, long, and jagged at the\r\nedges, and they do not turn yellow before they fall, as with the beech:\r\nthey are also longer or shorter, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds[2239] of holm-oak: one of them, which belongs to\r\nItaly, has a leaf not very unlike that of the olive; some of the Greeks\r\ngive it the name of “milax,”[2240] and in our provinces it is known as\r\nthe aquifolia. The acorn of these two kinds is shorter and more slender\r\nthan in the others: Homer[2241] calls it “acylos,” and by that name\r\ndistinguishes it from the ordinary acorn: it is generally said that the\r\nmale tree of the holm-oak bears no fruit.\r\n\r\nThe best acorn, and the very largest, is that which grows upon the\r\nquercus, and the next to it is the fruit of the æsculus: that of the\r\nrobur, again, is diminutive, and the fruit of the cerrus has a meagre,\r\nwretched look, being enclosed in a calyx covered with prickles, like\r\nthe outer coat of the chesnut. With reference to the acorn of the\r\nquercus, that which grows upon the female tree[2242] is sweeter and\r\nmore tender, while that of the male is more solid and compact. The\r\nacorn, however, of the latifolia[2243] is the most esteemed, an oak\r\nso called from the remarkable broadness of its leaves. The acorns\r\ndiffer also among themselves in size, and the comparative fineness of\r\nthe outer shell; as also in the circumstance that some have beneath\r\nthe shell a rough coat of a rusty colour, while in others a white\r\nflesh immediately presents itself. Those, too, are more particularly\r\nesteemed, the two extremities of the nut of which, taken lengthwise,\r\nare as hard as a stone: and it is considered preferable that this\r\npeculiarity should present itself rather in the shell than in the\r\nflesh: in either case, however, it only exists in the fruit of the\r\nmale tree. In some kinds, again, the acorn is oval, in others round;\r\nwhile in others it is of a more pointed form. The colour, too, varies\r\nconsiderably, according as it is blacker or whiter; this last being\r\nheld in the highest esteem. The extremities of the acorn are bitter,\r\nbut the flesh in the middle of it is sweet;[2244] another difference,\r\ntoo, consists in the comparative length or shortness of the stalk.\r\n\r\nAs for the trees themselves, the one that bears the acorn of largest\r\nsize is known as the “hemeris;”[2245] a small tree with a thick bushy\r\nfoliage all around it, and often hollowed at the place where the\r\nbranch is joined to the trunk. The quercus has a stronger wood, and\r\nless susceptible of decay: this also is a very branchy tree, but is\r\nmuch taller than the last, while the trunk is considerably thicker.\r\nThe ægilops,[2246] however, is the highest of them all, and is much\r\nattached to wild, uncultivated spots. Next to this in height is the\r\nlatifolia, but its wood is far from being so useful either for building\r\npurposes or for charcoal. When rough-hewn it is very apt to spoil,\r\nhence it is that it is generally used in an unhewn state. As charcoal,\r\nit is considered only economical in smelting copper; for the moment\r\nthe workman ceases to blow, the fire dies out, and hence it requires\r\nto be repeatedly rekindled; while at the same time it gives out great\r\nquantities of sparks. The best charcoal is that obtained from the wood\r\nof young trees.[2247] Square billets of wood, newly cut, are piled\r\ncompactly together with clay, and built up in the form of a chimney;\r\nthe pile is then set fire to, and incisions are made in the coat of\r\nclay as it gradually hardens, by the aid of long poles, for the purpose\r\nof letting the moisture of the wood evaporate.\r\n\r\nThe worst kind of all, however, both for timber and for making\r\ncharcoal, is the oak known as the “haliphlœos,”[2248] the bark of which\r\nis remarkably thick, and the trunk of considerable size, but mostly\r\nhollow and spongy: it is the only one of this species that rots while\r\nthe tree is still alive. In addition to this, it is very frequently\r\nstruck by lightning, although it is not so remarkably lofty in height:\r\nfor this reason it is not considered lawful to employ its wood for\r\nthe purposes of sacrifice. It is but rarely that it bears any acorns,\r\nand when it does they are bitter: no animal will touch them, with the\r\nsole exception of swine, and not even they, if they can get any other\r\nfood. An additional reason also for its exclusion from all religious\r\nceremonials, is the circumstance that the fire is very apt to go out in\r\nthe middle of the sacrifice when the wood of it is used for fuel.\r\n\r\nThe acorn of the beech, when given to swine,[2249] makes them brisk and\r\nlively, and renders the flesh tender for cooking, and light and easy\r\nof digestion; while, on the other hand, that of the holm oak has the\r\neffect of making them thin, pallid, meagre, and lumpish. The acorn of\r\nthe quercus is of a broad shape, and is the heaviest as well as the\r\nsweetest of them all. According to Nigidius, the acorn of the cerrus\r\noccupies the next rank to this, and, indeed, there is no acorn that\r\nrenders the flesh of swine more firm, though at the same time it is\r\napt to impart a certain degree of hardness. The same author assures us\r\nalso, that the acorn of the holm oak is a trying diet for swine, unless\r\nit is given in very small quantities at a time. He says, too, that\r\nthis acorn is the last to fall, and that the flesh of swine, if fed\r\nupon the acorns of the æsculus, the robur, or the cork-tree, will be of\r\na spongy nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—THE GALL-NUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll[2250] the glandiferous trees produce the gall-nut as well: they\r\nonly bear acorns, however, in alternate years. The gall-nut of the\r\nhemeris[2251] is considered the choicest of all, and the best adapted\r\nfor the preparation of leather: that of the latifolia closely resembles\r\nit, but is somewhat lighter, and not by any means so highly approved.\r\nThis last tree produces the black gall-nut also—for there are two\r\nvarieties of it—this last being deemed preferable for dyeing wool.\r\n\r\n(7.) The gall-nut begins to grow just as the sun is leaving the sign\r\nof Gemini,[2252] and always bursts forth in its entirety in a single\r\nnight.[2253] The white variety grows, too, in a single day, but if\r\nthe heat happens to overtake it, it shrinks immediately, and never\r\narrives at its proper size, which is about that of a bean. The black\r\ngall-nut will remain green for a longer period, and sometimes attains\r\nthe size of an apple[2254] even. The best kind is that which comes from\r\nCommagene,[2255] and the most inferior are those produced by the robur:\r\nit may easily be tested by means of certain holes in it which admit of\r\nthe passage of the light.[2256]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—OTHER PRODUCTIONS ON THESE TREES BESIDES THE ACORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe robur, in addition to its fruit, has a great number of other\r\nproductions: it bears[2257] the two varieties of the gall-nut, and a\r\nproduction which closely resembles the mulberry,[2258] except that it\r\ndiffers from it in being dry and hard: for the most part it bears a\r\nresemblance to a bull’s head, and in the inside there is a fruit very\r\nsimilar to the stone of the olive. Little balls[2259] also are found\r\ngrowing on the robur, not unlike nuts in appearance, and containing\r\nwithin them a kind of soft wool, which is used for burning in lamps;\r\nfor it will keep burning without oil, which is the case also with the\r\nblack gall-nut. It bears another kind, too, of little ball, covered\r\nwith hair,[2260] but used for no purpose: in spring, however, this\r\ncontains a juice like honey. In the hollows formed by the union of\r\nthe trunk and branches of this tree there are found also small round\r\nballs,[2261] which adhere bodily to the bark, and not by means of a\r\nstalk: at the point of junction they are white, but the rest of the\r\nbody is spotted all over with black: inside they are of a scarlet\r\ncolour, but on opening them they are found to be empty, and are of a\r\nbitter taste.\r\n\r\nSometimes, too, the robur bears a kind of pumice,[2262] as well as\r\nlittle balls, which are formed of the leaves rolled up; upon the veins\r\nof the leaves, too, there are watery pustules, of a whitish hue, and\r\ntransparent while they are soft; in these a kind of gnat[2263] is\r\nproduced, and they come to maturity just in the same way that the\r\nordinary gall-nut does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (8.)—CACHRYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe robur bears cachrys,[2264] too; such being the name given to\r\na small round ball that is employed in medicine for its caustic\r\nproperties. It grows on the fir likewise, the larch, the pitch-tree,\r\nthe linden, the nut-tree, and the plane, and remains on the tree\r\nthroughout the winter, after the leaves have fallen. It contains a\r\nkernel very similar to that of the pine-nut, and increases in size\r\nduring the winter. In spring the ball opens throughout, and it finally\r\ndrops when the leaves are beginning to grow.\r\n\r\nSuch is the multiplicity of the products borne by the robur in addition\r\nto its acorns; and not only these, but mushrooms[2265] as well, of\r\nbetter or worse quality, the most recent stimulants that have been\r\ndiscovered for the appetite; these last are found growing about its\r\nroots. Those of the quercus are the most highly esteemed, while those\r\nof the robur, the cypress, and the pine are injurious.[2266] The robur\r\nproduces mistletoe[2267] also, and, if we may believe Hesiod,[2268]\r\nhoney as well: indeed, it is a well-known fact, that a honey-like[2269]\r\ndew falling from heaven, as we have already mentioned,[2270] deposits\r\nitself upon the leaves of this tree in preference to those of any\r\nother. It is also well known that the wood of this tree, when burnt,\r\nproduces a nitrous[2271] ash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12.—THE KERMES BERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe holm oak, however, by its scarlet berry[2272] alone challenges\r\ncompetition with all these manifold productions. This grain appears at\r\nfirst sight to be a roughness on the surface of the tree, as it were,\r\na small kind of the aquifolia[2273] variety of holm oak, known as the\r\ncusculium.[2274] To the poor in Spain it furnishes[2275] the means of\r\npaying one half of their tribute. We have already, when speaking[2276]\r\nof the purple of the murex, mentioned the best methods adopted for\r\nusing it. It is produced also in Galatia, Africa, Pisidia, and Cilicia:\r\nthe most inferior kind is that of Sardinia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—AGARIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is in the Gallic provinces more particularly that the glandiferous\r\ntrees produce agaric;[2277] such being the name given to a white fungus\r\nwhich has a strong odour, and is very useful as an antidote. It grows\r\nupon the top of the tree, and gives out a brilliant light[2278] at\r\nnight: this, indeed, is the sign by which its presence is known, and by\r\nthe aid of this light it may be gathered during the night. The ægilops\r\nis the only one among the glandiferous trees that bears a kind of\r\ndry cloth,[2279] covered with a white mossy shag, and this, not only\r\nattached to the bark, but hanging down from the branches as well, a\r\ncubit even in length: this substance has a strong odour, as we have\r\nalready[2280] stated, when speaking of the perfumes.\r\n\r\nThe cork is but a very small tree, and its acorn is of the very\r\nworst[2281] quality, and rarely to be found as well: the bark[2282] is\r\nits only useful product, being remarkably thick, and if removed it will\r\ngrow again. When straitened out, it has been known to form planks as\r\nmuch as ten feet square. This substance is employed more particularly\r\nattached as a buoy to the ropes[2283] of ships’ anchors and the\r\ndrag-nets of fishermen. It is employed also for the bungs of casks and\r\nas a material for the winter shoes[2284] of females; for which reason\r\nthe Greeks not inappropriately call them[2285] “the bark of a tree.”\r\n\r\nThere are some writers who speak of it as the female of the holm oak;\r\nand in the countries where the holm does not grow, they substitute for\r\nit the wood of the cork-tree, more particularly in cartwrights’ work,\r\nin the vicinity of Elis and Lacedæmon for instance. The cork-tree does\r\nnot grow throughout the whole of Italy, and in no[2286] part whatever\r\nof Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (9.)—TREES OF WHICH THE BARK IS USED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bark also of the beech, the lime, the fir, and the pitch-tree is\r\nextensively used by the peasantry. Panniers and baskets are made of\r\nit, as also the large flat hampers which are employed for the carriage\r\nof corn and grapes: roofs of cottages,[2287] too, are made of this\r\nmaterial. When a spy has been sent out he often leaves information for\r\nhis general, written upon fresh bark, by cutting letters in the parts\r\nof it that are the most juicy. The bark of the beech is also employed\r\nfor religious purposes in certain sacred rites.[2288] This tree,\r\nhowever, when deprived of its bark, will not survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15. (10.)—SHINGLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best shingles are those made of the wood of the robur; the next\r\nbest being those furnished by the other glandiferous trees and the\r\nbeech. Those most easily made are cut from the wood of the resinous\r\ntrees, but they do not last,[2289] with the exception of those made\r\nof pine. Cornelius Nepos informs us, that Rome was roofed solely with\r\nshingles down to the time of the war with Pyrrhus, a period of four\r\nhundred and seventy years. It is well known that it was remarkable for\r\nthe fine forests in its vicinity. Even at the present day, the name\r\nof Jupiter Fagutalus points out in what locality there stood a grove\r\nof beeches;[2290] the Querquetulan Gate shows where the quercus once\r\nstood, and the Viminal Hill is the spot where the “vimen”[2291] was\r\nsought in ancient times. In many other parts, too, there were groves to\r\nbe found, and sometimes as many as two. Q. Hortensius, the Dictator, on\r\nthe secession of the plebeians to the Janiculum, passed a law in the\r\nÆsculetum,[2292] that what the plebeians had enacted should be binding\r\nupon every Roman citizen.[2293]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—THE PINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those days they regarded as exotics, because they did not exist in\r\nthe vicinity[2294] of the City, the pine and the fir, as well as all\r\nthe other varieties that produce pitch; of which we shall now proceed\r\nto speak, in order that the method of seasoning wine, from the very\r\nfirst, may be fully known. Whereas there are several among the trees\r\nalready mentioned in Asia or the East, that produce pitch, in Europe\r\nthere are but six varieties of kindred trees that supply it. In this\r\nnumber there are the pine[2295] and the pinaster,[2296] which have\r\nlong thin leaves like hair, and pointed at the end. The pine yields\r\nthe least resin of them all: in the pine nut, indeed, of which we have\r\npreviously spoken,[2297] it is sometimes to be found, but hardly in\r\nsufficient quantities to warrant us in reckoning the pine among the\r\nresinous trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—THE PINASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pinaster is nothing else but a wild pine: it rises to a surprising\r\nheight, and throws out branches from the middle, just as the pine does\r\nfrom the top. This tree yields a more copious supply of resin than\r\nthe pine: the mode in which this is done we shall set forth[2298] on\r\na future occasion. It grows also in flat countries. Many people think\r\nthat this is the same tree that grows along the shores of Italy, and\r\nis known as the “tibulus;”[2299] but this last is slender, and more\r\ncompact than the pine; it is likewise free from knots, and hence is\r\nused in the construction of light gallies;[2300] they are both almost\r\nentirely destitute of resin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—THE PITCH-TREE: THE FIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pitch-tree[2301] loves the mountain heights and cold localities.\r\nThis is a funereal tree, and, as an emblem of death, is placed before\r\nthe door of the deceased, and is left to grow in the vicinity of the\r\nfuneral pile. Still, however, it is now some time since it was admitted\r\ninto our gardens, in consequence of the facility with which it is\r\nclipped into various shapes. It gives out considerable quantities\r\nof resin,[2302] which is intermingled with white granulations like\r\npearls, and so similar in appearance to frankincense, that when mixed,\r\nit is impossible to distinguish them; hence the adulterations we find\r\npractised in the Seplasia.[2303] All this class of trees have a short\r\nbristly leaf, thick and hard, like that of the cypress. The branches of\r\nthe pitch-tree are of moderate size, and extend from almost the very\r\nroot of the tree, adhering to the sides like so many arms: the same is\r\nthe case with the fir,[2304] the wood of which is held in great esteem\r\nfor ship-building.\r\n\r\nThis tree grows upon the summits of lofty mountains, as though, in\r\nfact, it had an antipathy to the sea, and it does not at all differ\r\nfrom the pitch-tree in appearance: the wood is also very highly\r\nesteemed for the construction of rafters, and many other appliances of\r\nlife. A flow of resin, which in the pitch-tree constitutes its great\r\nmerit, is looked upon as a defect in the fir,[2305] though it will\r\ngenerally exude in some small quantity on exposure of the wood, to the\r\naction of the sun. On the other hand, the wood which in the fir-tree is\r\nremarkably fine, in the pitch-tree is only used for making shingles,\r\nvats, and a few other articles of joiners’ work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—THE LARCH: THE TORCH-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifth kind of resinous tree has the same localities, and is very\r\nsimilar in appearance; it is known as the larch.[2306] The wood of\r\nthis tree is far more valuable, being unimpaired by time, and proof\r\nagainst all decay; it is of a reddish colour, and of an acrid smell.\r\nResin[2307] flows from this wood in still greater quantities; it is of\r\nthe colour of honey, more viscous than the other varieties, and never\r\nturns hard.\r\n\r\nA sixth variety is the torch-tree,[2308] properly so called, which\r\ngives out more resin than any of the others, with the exception of the\r\npitch-tree; but its resin is more liquid than that of this last. The\r\nwood, too, of this tree is more particularly employed for kindling\r\nfires and giving torch-light in religious ceremonials. Of this tree it\r\nis the male only that bears what is known to the Greeks by the name of\r\n“syce,”[2309] remarkable for its extremely powerful odour. When the\r\nlarch[2310] is changed into the torch-tree, it is a proof that it is in\r\na diseased state.\r\n\r\nThe wood of all these trees, when set fire to, gives out immoderate\r\nvolumes of sooty smoke,[2311] and sputters every now and then with\r\na sudden crackling noise, while it sends out red-hot charcoal to a\r\nconsiderable distance—with the sole exception of that of the larch,\r\nwhich will neither burn[2312] nor char, nor, in fact, suffer any more\r\nfrom the action of fire than a stone. All these trees are evergreens,\r\nand are not easily[2313] distinguished by the foliage, even by those\r\nwho are best acquainted with them, so nearly related are they to one\r\nanother. The pitch-tree, however, is not so high as the larch; which,\r\nagain, is stouter, and has a smoother bark, with a more velvety leaf,\r\nmore unctuous to the touch, thicker, and more soft and flexible.[2314]\r\nThe pitch-tree, again, has a leaf more sparsely scattered and drier;\r\nit is thinner also, and of a colder nature, rougher all over in\r\nappearance, and covered with a resinous deposit: the wood of this tree\r\nis most like that of the fir. The larch, when the roots are once\r\nburnt, will not throw out fresh shoots, which the pitch-tree will do,\r\nas was found to be the case in the island of Lesbos, after the Pyrrhæan\r\ngrove had been burnt there.\r\n\r\nIn the same species too, the variety of sex[2315] is found to\r\nconstitute a considerable difference: the male is the shorter tree, and\r\nhas a harder wood; while the female is taller, and bears a leaf more\r\nunctuous to the feel, smooth and free from all rigidity. The wood of\r\nthe male tree is hard and awry, and consequently not so well suited\r\nfor carpenters’ work; while that of the female is softer, as may be\r\nvery easily perceived on the application of the axe, a test, in fact,\r\nwhich, in every variety, immediately shows us which trees are males;\r\nthe axe in such case meeting with a greater resistance, falling with\r\na louder noise, and being withdrawn from the wood with considerably\r\ngreater difficulty: the wood of the male tree is more parched too, and\r\nthe root is of a blacker hue. In the vicinity of Mount Ida, in Troas,\r\nthe circumstance whether the tree grows in the mountain districts or\r\non the sea-shore, makes another considerable difference. In Macedonia\r\nand Arcadia, and in the neighbourhood of Elis, the names of the several\r\nvarieties have been totally altered, and it has not been agreed by\r\nauthors which name ought to be given to each: we have, therefore,\r\ncontented ourselves with employing the Roman denominations solely.\r\n\r\nThe fir is the largest of them all, the female being the taller of\r\nthe two; the wood, too, is softer and more easily worked. This tree\r\nis of a rounder form than the others, and its leaves are closely\r\npacked and feathered, so as not to admit of the passage of rain; the\r\nappearance, too, of the tree is altogether more cheerful. From the\r\nbranches of these different varieties, with the sole exception of the\r\nlarch,[2316] there hang numbers of scaly nuts of compact shape, like\r\nso many catkins. The nuts found upon the male fir have a kernel in the\r\nfore-part, which is not the case with those on the female tree. In\r\nthe pitch-tree, again, these kernels, which are very small and black,\r\noccupy the whole of the catkin, which is smaller and more slender than\r\nin the other varieties; hence it is that the Greeks call this tree by\r\nthe name of phthirophoron.[2317] In this tree, too, the nuts on the\r\nmale are more compressed, and less moist with resin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—THE YEW.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot to omit any one of them, the yew[2318] is similar to these other\r\ntrees in general appearance. It is of a colour, however, but slightly\r\napproaching to green, and of a slender form; of sombre and ominous\r\naspect, and quite destitute of juice: it is the only one, too, among\r\nthem all, that bears a berry. In the male tree the fruit is injurious;\r\nindeed, in Spain more particularly, the berries contain a deadly\r\npoison.[2319] It is an ascertained fact that travellers’ vessels,[2320]\r\nmade in Gaul of this wood, for the purpose of holding wine, have\r\ncaused the death of those who used them. Sextius says, that in Greece\r\nthis tree is known by the name of “smilax,” and that in Arcadia it is\r\npossessed of so active a poison, that those who sleep beneath it, or\r\neven take food[2321] there, are sure to meet their death from it. There\r\nare authors, also, who assert that the poisons which we call at the\r\npresent day “toxica,” and in which arrows are dipped, were formerly\r\ncalled taxica,[2322] from this tree. It has been discovered, also, that\r\nthese poisonous qualities are quite neutralized by driving a copper\r\nnail into the wood of the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (11.)—METHODS OF MAKING TAR—HOW CEDRIUM IS MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Europe, tar is extracted from the torch-tree[2323] by the agency\r\nof fire; it is employed for coating ships and for many other useful\r\npurposes.[2324] The wood of the tree is chopped[2325] into small\r\nbillets, and then put into a furnace, which is heated by fires lighted\r\non every side. The first steam that exudes flows in the form of water\r\ninto a reservoir made for its reception: in Syria this substance is\r\nknown as “cedrium;”[2326] and it possesses such remarkable strength,\r\nthat in Egypt the bodies of the dead, after being steeped in it, are\r\npreserved from all corruption.[2327]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22.—METHODS BY WHICH THICK PITCH IS PREPARED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe liquid that follows is of a thicker consistency, and constitutes\r\npitch, properly so called. This liquid, thrown again into a brazen\r\ncauldron, and mixed with vinegar, becomes still[2328] thicker, and when\r\nleft to coagulate, receives the name of “Bruttian”[2329] pitch. It is\r\nused, however, only for pitching the insides of dolia[2330] and other\r\nvessels, it differing from the other kinds in being more viscous, of a\r\nredder colour, and more unctuous than is usually the case. All these\r\nvarieties of pitch are prepared from the pitch-tree, by putting red-hot\r\nstones, with the resinous wood, in troughs made of strong oak; or if\r\nthese troughs are not attainable, by piling up billets of the wood in\r\nthe method employed for the manufacture of charcoal.[2331] It is this\r\npitch that is used for seasoning wine, being first pounded and reduced\r\nto a fine powder: it is of a blacker colour, too, than the other\r\nsort. The same resin, if boiled gently with water, and then strained\r\noff, becomes viscous, and assumes a red colour; it is then known as\r\n“distilled[2332] pitch:” for making this, the refuse portions of the\r\nresin and the bark of the tree are generally selected.\r\n\r\nAnother method is adopted for the manufacture of that used as\r\ncrapula.[2333] Raw flower of resin is taken, direct from the tree, with\r\na plentiful sprinkling of small, thin chips of the wood. These are then\r\npounded[2334] down and passed through a sieve, after which they are\r\nsteeped in water, which is heated till it comes to a boil. The unctuous\r\nportion that is extracted from this is the best resin: it is but rarely\r\nto be met with, and then only in a few places in Italy, in the vicinity\r\nof the Alps: it is in considerable request for medicinal purposes. For\r\nthis, they generally boil a congius of white resin to two congii of\r\nrain-water:[2335] some persons, however, think it better[2336] to boil\r\nit without water for one whole day by a slow fire, taking care to use a\r\nvessel of white copper.[2337] Some, again, are in the habit of boiling\r\nthe resin of the terebinth[2338] in a flat pan[2339] placed upon hot\r\nashes, and prefer it to any other kind. The resin of the mastich[2340]\r\nis held in the next degree of estimation.[2341]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23. (12.)—HOW THE RESIN CALLED ZOPISSA IS PREPARED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not omit, too, that the Greeks call by the name of\r\nzopissa[2342] the pitch mixed with wax which has been scraped from\r\noff the bottoms of sea-going ships;[2343] for there is nothing, in\r\nfact, that has been left untried by mankind. This composition is found\r\nmuch more efficient for all those purposes in which pitch and resin\r\nare employed, in consequence of the superior hardness which has been\r\nimparted to it by the sea-salt.\r\n\r\nThe pitch-tree is opened[2344] on the side that faces the sun, not by\r\nmeans of an incision, but of a wound made by the removal of the bark:\r\nthis opening being generally two feet in width and one cubit from the\r\nground, at the very least. The body of the tree, too, is not spared in\r\nthis instance, as in others, for even the very chips from off it are\r\nconsidered as having their use; those, however, from the lower part\r\nof the tree are looked upon as the best, the wood of the higher parts\r\ngiving the resin a bitter[2345] taste. In a short time all the resinous\r\njuices of the entire tree come to a point of confluence in the wound so\r\ninflicted: the same process is adopted also with the torch-tree. When\r\nthe liquid ceases to flow, the tree is opened in a similar manner in\r\nsome other part, and then, again, elsewhere: after which the whole tree\r\nis cut down, and the pith[2346] of it is used for burning.[2347]\r\n\r\nSo, too, in Syria they take the bark from off the terebinth; and,\r\nindeed, in those parts they do not spare even the root or branches,\r\nalthough in general the resin obtained from those parts is held in\r\ndisesteem. In Macedonia they subject the whole of the male larch to the\r\naction of fire, but of the female[2348] only the roots. Theopompus\r\nhas stated in his writings that in the territory of the Apolloniates\r\nthere is found a kind of mineral pitch,[2349] not inferior to that\r\nof Macedonia. The best pitch[2350] everywhere is that obtained from\r\ntrees planted on sunny spots with a north-east aspect; while that\r\nwhich is produced from more shaded localities has a disagreeable\r\nlook and a repulsive odour. Pitch, too, that is produced amid the\r\ncold of winter is of inferior quality, being in smaller quantity,\r\ntoo, and comparatively colourless. Some persons are of opinion that\r\nin mountainous localities this liquid is produced in the greatest\r\nabundance, and that it is of superior colour and of a sweeter taste\r\nand has a finer smell so long as it remains in a state of resin; but\r\nthat when, on the other hand, it is subjected to boiling, it yields\r\na smaller quantity of pitch, because so much of it goes[2351] off in\r\na serous shape. They say that the resinous trees, too, that grow on\r\nmountains are thinner than those that are found on plains, but that\r\nthey are apt, both of them, to be unproductive in clear, dry weather.\r\n\r\nSome trees, too, afford a flow of resinous juice the year after the\r\nincision is made, some, again, in the second year, and others in the\r\nthird. The wound so made is filled with resin, but not with bark, or by\r\nthe cicatrization of the outer coat; for the bark in this tree never\r\nunites. Among these varieties some authors have made the sappium[2352]\r\nto constitute a peculiar kind, because it is produced from the seed\r\nof a kindred variety, as we have already stated when speaking of the\r\nnuts[2353] of trees; and they have given the name of tæda[2354] to\r\nthe lower parts of the tree; although in reality this tree is nothing\r\nelse but a pitch-tree, which by careful cultivation has lost some\r\nsmall portion of its wild character. The name “sappinus” is also given\r\nto the timber of these trees when cut, as we shall have occasion to\r\nmention[2355] hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24. (13.)—TREES THE WOOD OF WHICH IS HIGHLY VALUED. FOUR\r\nVARIETIES OF THE ASH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is for the sake of their timber that Nature has created the other\r\ntrees, and more particularly the ash,[2356] which yields it in greater\r\nabundance. This is a tall, tapering tree, with a feather-like leaf: it\r\nhas been greatly ennobled by the encomiums of Homer, and the fact that\r\nit formed the spear of Achilles:[2357] the wood of it is employed for\r\nnumerous purposes. The ash which grows upon Mount Ida, in Troas, is so\r\nextremely like the cedar,[2358] that, when the bark is removed, it will\r\ndeceive a purchaser.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks have distinguished two varieties of this tree, the one long\r\nand without knots, the other short, with a harder wood, of a darker\r\ncolour, and a leaf like that of the laurel. In Macedonia they give the\r\nname of “bumelia”[2359] to an ash of remarkably large size, with a\r\nwood of extreme flexibility. Some authors have divided this tree into\r\nseveral varieties, according to the localities which it inhabits, and\r\nsay that the ash of the plains has a spotted wood, while that of the\r\nmountain ash is more compact. Some Greek writers have stated that the\r\nleaf of the ash is poisonous[2360] to beasts of burden, but harmless to\r\nall the animals that ruminate.[2361] The leaves of this tree in Italy,\r\nhowever, are not injurious to beasts of burden even; so far from it,\r\nin fact, that nothing has been found to act as so good a specific for\r\nthe bites of serpents[2362] as to drink the juice extracted from the\r\nleaves, and to apply them to the wounds. So great, too, are the virtues\r\nof this tree, that no serpent will ever lie in the shadow thrown by\r\nit, either in the morning or the evening, be it ever so long; indeed,\r\nthey will always keep at the greatest possible distance from it. We\r\nstate the fact from ocular demonstration,[2363] that if a serpent and\r\na lighted fire are placed within a circle formed of the leaves of the\r\nash, the reptile will rather throw itself into the fire than encounter\r\nthe leaves of the tree. By a wonderful provision of Nature, the ash has\r\nbeen made to blossom before the serpents leave their holes, and the\r\nfall of its leaf does not take place till after they have retired for\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25. (14.)—TWO VARIETIES OF THE LINDEN-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the linden-tree the male[2364] and the female are totally different.\r\nIn the male the wood is hard and knotty, of a redder hue, and with\r\na stronger smell; the bark, too, is thicker, and, when taken off,\r\nhas no flexibility. The male bears neither seed nor blossom as the\r\nfemale does, the trunk of which is thicker, and the wood white and of\r\nexcellent quality. It is a singular[2365] thing, but no animal will\r\ntouch the fruit of this tree, although the juice of the leaves and the\r\nbark is sweet. Between the bark and the wood there are a number of\r\nthin coats, formed by the union of numerous fine membranes; of these\r\nthey make those bands[2366] which are known to us as “tiliæ.” The\r\nfiner membranes are called “philyræ,” and are rendered famous by the\r\nhonourable mention that the ancients have made of them as ribbons for\r\nwreaths[2367] and garlands. The wood of this tree is proof against the\r\nattacks of worms:[2368] it is of moderate height[2369] only, but of\r\nvery considerable utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26. (15.)—TEN VARIETIES OF THE MAPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maple, which is pretty nearly of the same[2370] size as the lime,\r\nis inferior to the citrus[2371] only for the beauty of its wood when\r\nemployed for cabinet work, and the exquisite finish it admits of.\r\nThere are numerous varieties[2372] of this tree; the light maple,\r\nremarkable for the extreme whiteness of its wood, is known as the\r\n“Gallic”[2373] maple in Italy beyond the Padus, being a native of the\r\ncountries beyond the Alps. Another kind is covered with wavy spots\r\nrunning in all directions. In consequence of its superior beauty it\r\nhas received its name,[2374] from its strong resemblance to the marks\r\nwhich are seen in the tail of the peacock; the finest kinds are those\r\nwhich grow in Istria and Rhætia. An inferior sort of maple is known as\r\n“crassivenium.”[2375]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks distinguish the varieties according to their respective\r\nlocalities. The maple of the plains,[2376] they say, is white, and\r\nnot wavy; they give it the name of “glinon.” On the other hand, the\r\nmountain maple,[2377] they say, is of a more variegated appearance,\r\nand harder, the wood of the male tree being more particularly so, and\r\nthe best adapted for specimens of elegant workmanship. A third kind,\r\nagain, according to the Greeks, is the zygia,[2378] with a red wood,\r\nwhich is easily split, and a pale, rough bark. Other authors, however,\r\nprefer to make of this last a peculiar species, and give it in Latin\r\nthe name of “carpinus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27. (16.)—BRUSCUM: MOLLUSCUM; THE STAPHYLODENDRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the most beautiful feature of all in the maple is what is known\r\nas bruscum, and, even more particularly so, the molluscum. These are\r\nboth of them tuberosities of this tree, the bruscum presenting veins\r\nmore violently contorted, while those of the molluscum are disposed\r\nin a more simple and uniform manner: indeed, if this last were of\r\nsufficiently large size to admit of tables being made of it, there is\r\nno doubt that it would be preferred to the wood of the citrus even. At\r\nthe present day, however, we find it but little used except for the\r\nleaves of tablets, or as a veneer for couches.[2379] Tuberosities are\r\nalso found on the alder,[2380] but as much inferior to those already\r\nmentioned, as the alder itself is to the maple. In the maple the male\r\ntree[2381] is the first to blossom. The trees that frequent dry spots\r\nare preferred to those that grow in watery localities, which is the\r\ncase also with the ash.\r\n\r\nThere is found in the countries beyond the Alps a tree, the wood of\r\nwhich is very similar to that of the white maple, and which is known as\r\nthe staphylodendron.[2382] This tree bears a pod[2383] in which there\r\nis found a kernel, which has the flavour of the hazel-nut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—THREE VARIETIES OF THE BOX-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most highly esteemed of all the woods is the box,[2384]\r\nbut it is seldom veined, and then only the wood of the root. In\r\nother respects, it is a wood, so to say, of quiet and unpretending\r\nappearance, but highly esteemed for a certain degree of hardness\r\nand its pallid hue: the tree, too, is very extensively employed in\r\nornamental gardening.[2385] There are three[2386] varieties of it: the\r\nGallic[2387] box, which is trained to shoot upwards in a pyramidal\r\nform, and attains a very considerable height; the oleaster,[2388] which\r\nis condemned as being utterly worthless, and emits a disagreeable\r\nodour; and a third, known as the “Italian” box,[2389] a wild variety,\r\nin my opinion, which has been improved by cultivation. This last\r\nspreads more than the others, and forms a thick hedge: it is an\r\nevergreen, and is easily clipped.\r\n\r\nThe box-tree abounds on the Pyrenean[2390] range, the mountains of\r\nCytorus, and the country about Berecynthus.[2391] The trunk grows to\r\nthe largest size in the island of Corsica,[2392] and its blossom is\r\nby no means despicable; it is this that causes the honey there to be\r\nbitter.[2393] The seed of the box is held in aversion by all animals.\r\nThat which grows upon Mount Olympus in Macedonia is not more slender\r\nthan the other kinds, but the tree is of a more stunted growth. It\r\nloves spots exposed to the cold winds and the sun: in fire, too, it\r\nmanifests all the hardness of iron; it gives out no flame, and is of no\r\nuse whatever for the manufacture of charcoal.[2394]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29. (17.)—FOUR VARIETIES OF THE ELM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMidway between the preceding ones and the fruit-trees stands the elm,\r\npartaking of the nature of the former in its wood, and being akin to\r\nthe latter in the friendship which it manifests for the vine.[2395]\r\nThe Greeks distinguish two varieties of this tree: the mountain[2396]\r\nelm, which is the larger of the two, and that of the plains, which\r\nis more shrubby. Italy gives the name of “Atinia”[2397] to the more\r\nlofty kinds, and gives the preference to those which are of a dry\r\nnature and will not grow in damp localities. Another variety is the\r\nGallic elm,[2398] and a third, the Italian,[2399] with leaves lying\r\ncloser together, and springing in greater numbers from a single\r\nstalk. A fourth kind is the wild elm. The Atinia does not produce any\r\nsamara,[2400] that being the name given to the seed of the elm. All\r\nthe elms will grow from slips or cuttings, and all of them, with the\r\nexception of the Atinia, may be propagated from seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30. (18.)—THE NATURES OF THE VARIOUS TREES ACCORDING TO THEIR\r\nLOCALITIES: THE MOUNTAIN TREES, AND THE TREES OF THE PLAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now made mention of the more remarkable trees, it remains for\r\nme to state some general facts connected with them all. The cedar, the\r\nlarch, the torch-tree, and the other resinous trees prefer mountainous\r\nlocalities:[2401] the same is the case also with the aquifolia, the\r\nbox, the holm-oak, the juniper, the terebinth, the poplar, the wild\r\nmountain-ash, and the yoke-elm.[2402] On the Apennines there is also\r\nfound a shrub known as the “cotinus,”[2403] famous for imparting to\r\ncloth a purple colour like that of the murex. The fir, the robur, the\r\nchesnut, the lime, the holm-oak, and the cornel will grow equally well\r\non mountain or in valley; while the maple,[2404] the ash, the service,\r\nthe linden, and the cherry, more particularly prefer a watery spot on\r\nthe slope of a hilly declivity. It is not often that we see the plum,\r\nthe pomegranate, the olive, the walnut, the mulberry, or the elder,\r\ngrowing on an elevated site: the cornel, too, the hazel, the quercus,\r\nthe wild ash, the maple, the ash, the beech, and the yoke-elm, descend\r\nto the plains; while the elm, the apple, the pear, the laurel, the\r\nmyrtle, the blood-red[2405] shrub, the holm-oak, and the brooms[2406]\r\nthat are employed in dyeing cloths, all of them aspire to a more\r\nelevated locality.\r\n\r\nThe sorb,[2407] and even still more the birch,[2408] are fond of a cold\r\nsite; this last is a native of Gaul, of singular whiteness and slender\r\nshape, and rendered terrible as forming the fasces of the magistracy.\r\nFrom its flexibility it is employed also in making circlets and the\r\nribs of panniers. In Gaul,[2409] too, they extract a bitumen from it\r\nby boiling. To a cold site, also, belongs the thorn, which affords\r\nthe most auspicious torches[2410] of all for the nuptial ceremony;\r\nfrom the circumstance, as Massurius assures us, that the shepherds, on\r\nthe occasion of the rape of the Sabine women, made their torches of\r\nthe wood of this tree: at the present day, however, the woods of the\r\nyoke-elm and the hazel are more generally employed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—TREES WHICH GROW ON A DRY SOIL: THOSE WHICH ARE FOUND IN WET\r\nLOCALITIES: THOSE WHICH ARE FOUND IN BOTH INDIFFERENTLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cypress, the walnut, the chesnut, and the laburnum,[2411] are\r\naverse to water. This last tree is also a native of the Alps, and\r\nfar from generally known: the wood is hard and white,[2412] and the\r\nflowers, which are a cubit[2413] in length, no bee will ever touch. The\r\nshrub, too, known as Jupiter’s beard,[2414] manifests an equal dislike\r\nto water: it is often clipped, and is employed in ornamental gardening,\r\nbeing of a round, bushy form, with a silvery leaf. The willow, the\r\nalder, the poplar,[2415] the siler,[2416] and the privet,[2417] so\r\nextensively employed for making tallies,[2418] will only grow in damp,\r\nwatery places; which is the case also with the vaccinium,[2419] grown\r\nin Italy for drugging our slaves,[2420] and in Gaul for the purpose of\r\ndyeing the garments of slaves a purple colour. All those trees[2421]\r\nwhich are common to the mountains and the plains, grow to a larger\r\nsize, and are of more comely appearance when grown on the plains, while\r\nthose found on the mountains have a better wood and more finely veined,\r\nwith the exception of the apple and the pear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (19.)—DIVISION OF TREES INTO VARIOUS SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to these particulars, some of the trees lose their leaves,\r\nwhile others, again, are evergreens. Before, however, we treat of this\r\ndistinction, it will be necessary first to touch upon another. There\r\nare some trees that are altogether of a wild nature, while there are\r\nothers, again, that are more civilized, such being the names[2422] by\r\nwhich man has thought fit to distinguish the trees. Indeed, these last,\r\nwhich by their fruits or some other beneficial property, or else by the\r\nshade which they afford, show themselves the benefactors of man, are\r\nnot inappropriately called “civilized”[2423] trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33. (20.)—TREES WHICH DO NOT LOSE THEIR FOLIAGE. THE\r\nRHODODENDRON. TREES WHICH DO NOT LOSE THE WHOLE OF THEIR FOLIAGE.\r\nPLACES IN WHICH THERE ARE NO TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelonging to this last class, there are the following trees which do\r\nnot lose their leaves: the olive, the laurel, the palm, the myrtle,\r\nthe cypress, the pine, the ivy, the rhododendron,[2424] and, although\r\nit may be rather called a herb than a tree, the savin.[2425] The\r\nrhododendron, as its name indicates, comes from Greece. By some it is\r\nknown as the nerium,[2426] and by others as the rhododaphne. It is an\r\nevergreen, bearing a strong resemblance to the rose-tree, and throwing\r\nout numerous branches from the stem; to beasts of burden, goats, and\r\nsheep it is poisonous, but for man it is an antidote[2427] against the\r\nvenom of serpents.\r\n\r\n(21.) The following among the forest-trees do not lose their leaves:\r\nthe fir, the larch, the pinaster, the juniper, the cedar, the\r\nterebinth, the box, the holm-oak, the aquifolia, the cork, the yew,\r\nand the tamarisk.[2428] A middle place between the evergreens and\r\nthose which are not so, is occupied by the andrachle[2429] in Greece,\r\nand by the arbutus[2430] in all parts of the world; as they lose all\r\ntheir leaves with the exception of those on the top of the tree. Among\r\ncertain of the shrubs, too, the bramble and the calamus, the leaves do\r\nnot fall. In the territory of Thurii, where Sybaris formerly stood,\r\nfrom the city there was a single oak[2431] to be seen that never lost\r\nits leaves, and never used to bud before midsummer: it is a singular\r\nthing that this fact, which has been so often alluded to by the Greek\r\nwriters, should have been passed over in silence by our own.[2432]\r\nIndeed, so remarkable are the virtues that we find belonging to some\r\nlocalities, that about Memphis in Egypt, and at Elephantina in Thebais,\r\nthe leaves[2433] fall from none of the trees, not the vine even.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34. (22.)—THE NATURE OF THE LEAVES WHICH WITHER AND FALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the trees, with the exception of those already mentioned—a list\r\nwhich it would be tedious to enumerate—lose their leaves, and it has\r\nbeen observed that the leaf does not dry up and wither unless it is\r\nthin, broad, and soft; while, on the other hand, the leaves that do\r\nnot fall are those which are fleshy, thick, and narrow.[2434] It is\r\nan erroneous theory that the leaf does not fall in those trees the\r\njuices of which are more unctuous than the rest; for who could make\r\nout that such is the case with the holm-oak, for instance? Timæus, the\r\nmathematician, is of opinion that the leaves fall while the sun is\r\npassing through the sign of Scorpio, being acted upon by the influences\r\nof that luminary, and a certain venom which exists in the atmosphere:\r\nbut then we have a right to wonder how it is that, the same reasons\r\nexisting, the same influence is not exercised equally on all.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of most trees fall in autumn, but in some at a later\r\nperiod, remaining on the tree till the approach of winter, it making\r\nno difference whether they have germinated at an earlier period or a\r\nlater, seeing that some that are the very first to bud are among the\r\nlast to lose their leaves—the almond, the ash, and the elder, for\r\ninstance: the mulberry, on the other hand, buds the last of all, and\r\nloses its leaves among the very first. The soil, too, exercises a very\r\nconsiderable influence in this respect: the leaves falling sooner where\r\nit is dry and thin, and more particularly when the tree is old: indeed,\r\nthere are many trees that lose them before the fruit is ripe, as in\r\nthe case of the late fig, for instance, and the winter pear: on the\r\npomegranate, too, the fruit, when ripe, beholds nothing but the trunk\r\nof the parent tree. And not even upon those trees which always retain\r\ntheir foliage do the same leaves always remain, for as others shoot up\r\nbeneath them, the old leaves gradually wither away: this takes place\r\nabout the solstices more particularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—TREES WHICH HAVE LEAVES OF VARIOUS COLOURS; TREES WITH LEAVES\r\nOF VARIOUS SHAPES. THREE VARIETIES OF THE POPLAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leaves continue the same upon every species of tree, with the\r\nexception of the poplar, the ivy, and the croton, which we have already\r\nmentioned as being called the “cicus.”[2435]\r\n\r\n(23.) There are three kinds of poplar; the white,[2436] the\r\nblack,[2437] and the one known as the Libyan[2438] poplar, with a very\r\ndiminutive leaf, and extremely black; much esteemed also for the fungi\r\nwhich grow from it. The white poplar has a parti-coloured leaf, white\r\non the upper side and green beneath. This poplar, as also the black\r\nvariety, and the croton, have a rounded leaf when young, as though\r\nit had been described with a pair of compasses, but when it becomes\r\nolder the leaf throws out angular projections. On the other hand, the\r\nleaf of the ivy,[2439] which is angular at first, becomes rounder,\r\nthe older the tree. From the leaves of the poplar there falls a very\r\nthick down;[2440] upon the white poplar, which, it is said, has a\r\ngreater quantity of leaves than the others, this down is quite white,\r\nresembling locks of wool. The leaves of the pomegranate and the almond\r\nare red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—LEAVES WHICH TURN ROUND EVERY YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find a most remarkable and, indeed, a marvellous peculiarity[2441]\r\nexisting in the elm, the lime, the olive, the white poplar, and the\r\nwillow; for immediately after the summer solstice the leaves of these\r\ntrees turn completely round; indeed, we have no sign which indicates\r\nwith greater certainty that that period has past.\r\n\r\n(24.) These trees also present in their leaves the same difference\r\nthat is to be observed in those of all the rest: the underside, which\r\nlooks towards the ground, is of a green, grassy colour, and has a\r\nsmooth surface;[2442] while the veins, the callous skin, and the\r\narticulations, lie upon the upper face, the veins making incisions in\r\nthe parts beneath, like those to be seen upon the human hand. The leaf\r\nof the olive is whiter above, and not so smooth; the same is the case,\r\ntoo, with that of the ivy. The leaves of all trees turn[2443] every day\r\ntowards the sun, the object being that the under side may be warmed by\r\nits heat. The upper surface of them all has a down upon it, in however\r\nsmall quantity it may be; in some countries this down is used as a kind\r\nof wool.[2444]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—THE CARE BESTOWED ON THE LEAVES OF THE PALM, AND THE USES TO\r\nWHICH THEY ARE APPLIED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already said[2445] that in the East strong ropes are made of\r\nthe leaves of the palm, and that they are improved by lying in the\r\nwater. Among ourselves, too, the leaves of the palm are generally\r\nplucked immediately after harvest, the best being those that have no\r\ndivisions in them. These leaves are left to dry under cover for four\r\ndays, after which they are spread out in the sun, and left out in the\r\nopen air all night, till they have become quite white and dry: after\r\nthis they are split before they are put to any use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broadest leaves are those of the fig, the vine, and the plane;\r\nwhile those of the myrtle, the pomegranate, and the olive are narrow.\r\nThe leaf of the pine and the cedar is fine and resembles hair,\r\nwhile that of the holly and one variety of the holm oak[2446] is\r\nprickly—indeed, in the juniper, we find a thorn in place of a leaf.\r\nThe leaf of the cypress and the tamarisk[2447] is fleshy, and that\r\nof the alder is remarkable for its thickness.[2448] In the reed, the\r\nwillow, and the palm,[2449] the leaf is long, and in the latter tree\r\nit is double as well: that of the pear is rounded, and it is pointed\r\nin the apple.[2450] In the ivy the leaf is angular, and in the plane\r\ndivided.[2451] In the pitch-tree[2452] and the fir the leaf is indented\r\nlike the teeth of a comb; while in the robur it is sinuous on the whole\r\nof the outer margin: in the bramble it has a spiny surface. In some\r\nplants the leaf has the property of stinging, the nettle for instance;\r\nwhile in the pine,[2453] the pitch-tree, the fir, the larch, the cedar,\r\nand the holly, it is prickly. In the olive and the holm-oak it has a\r\nshort stalk, in the vine a long one: in the poplar the stalk of the\r\nleaf is always quivering,[2454] and the leaves of this tree are the\r\nonly ones that make a crackling noise[2455] when coming in contact with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIn one variety of the apple-tree[2456] we find a small leaf protruding\r\nfrom the very middle of the fruit, sometimes, indeed, a couple of\r\nthem. Then, again, in some trees the leaves are arranged all round\r\nthe branches, and in others at the extremities of them, while in the\r\nrobur they are found upon the trunk itself. They are sometimes thick\r\nand close, and at others thinly scattered, which is more particularly\r\nthe case where the leaf is large and broad. In the myrtle[2457] they\r\nare symmetrically arranged, in the box, concave, and, upon the apple,\r\nscattered without any order or regularity. In the apple and the pear\r\nwe find several leaves issuing from the same stalk, and in the elm and\r\nthe cytisus[2458] they are covered with ramified veins. To the above\r\nparticulars Cato[2459] adds that the leaves of the poplar and the\r\nquercus should not be given to cattle after they have fallen and become\r\nwithered, and he recommends the leaves of the fig,[2460] the holm-oak,\r\nand the ivy for oxen: the leaves, too, of the reed and the laurel are\r\nsometimes given them to eat. The leaves of the service-tree fall all at\r\nonce, but in the others only by degrees. Thus much in reference to the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39. (25.)—THE NATURAL ORDER OF THE PRODUCTION OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is the order in which the operations of Nature take\r\nplace throughout the year. The first is fecundation, which takes place\r\nwhen the west wind begins to prevail, generally about the sixth day\r\nbefore the ides of February.[2461] By the agency of this wind all the\r\nproductions of the earth are impregnated; to such an extent, indeed,\r\nthat the mares even in Spain are impregnated by it, as we have already\r\nstated.[2462] This is the generating principle of the universe, and it\r\nreceives its name of Favonius, as some think, from our word “fovere,”\r\nwhich means “to warm and cherish:” it blows from due west at the\r\nopening of the spring. The peasantry call this period of the year the\r\n“time of heat,”[2463] because Nature is then longing to receive the\r\nseeds of her various productions, and is imparting life to everything\r\nthat is planted. The vegetables conceive[2464] on various days, each\r\naccording to its respective nature: some immediately, as with animals,\r\nothers, again, more slowly, carrying with them for a longer period the\r\nproduce of their conception, a state which has from that circumstance\r\nobtained the name of “germination.” When the plant flowers, it may be\r\nsaid to bring forth, and the flower makes its appearance by bursting\r\nits little capsule, which has acted to it as an uterus. The period of\r\ntraining and education is the growth of the fruit. This, as well as\r\nthat of germination, is a laborious process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—TREES WHICH NEVER BLOSSOM. THE JUNIPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the blossom bespeaks the arrival of the spring and\r\nthe birth anew of the year; this blossom is the very pride and delight\r\nof the trees. Then it is that they show themselves quite renewed, and\r\naltogether different from what they really are; then it is that they\r\nquite revel in the contest with each other which shall excel in the\r\nvarious hues and tints which they display. This merit has, however,\r\nbeen denied to many of them; for they do not all blossom, and there are\r\ncertain sombre trees which do not participate in this joyous season of\r\nthe year. The holm-oak, the pitch-tree, the larch, and the pine are\r\nnever bedecked with blossoms, and with them there is no particular\r\nforerunner sent forth to announce the yearly birth of their respective\r\nfruits. The same is the case, too, with the cultivated and the wild\r\nfig,[2465] which immediately present their fruit in place of any\r\nblossom. Upon the fig, too, it is remarkable that there are abortive\r\nfruit to be seen which never ripen.\r\n\r\nThe juniper, also, is destitute[2466] of blossom; some writers,\r\nhowever, distinguish two varieties of it, one of which blossoms but\r\nbears no fruit,[2467] while the other has no blossom, but presents the\r\nberries immediately, which remain on the tree for so long a period as\r\ntwo years: this assertion, however, is utterly fallacious, and all the\r\njunipers always present the same sombre appearance. So, too, in life,\r\nthe fortunes of many men are ever without their time of blossoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41.—THE FECUNDATION OF TREES. GERMINATION: THE APPEARANCE OF THE\r\nFRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll trees germinate, however,[2468] even those which do not blossom.\r\nIn this respect there is a very considerable difference in relation to\r\nthe various localities; for in the same species we find that the tree,\r\nwhen planted in a marshy spot, will germinate earlier than elsewhere;\r\nnext to that, the trees that grow on the plains, and last of all those\r\nthat are found in the woods: the wild pear, too, is naturally later\r\nin budding than the other pears. At the first breath of the west\r\nwind[2469] the cornel buds, and close upon it the laurel; then, a\r\nlittle before the equinox, we find the lime and the maple germinating.\r\nAmong the earlier trees, too, are the poplar, the elm, the willow, the\r\nalder, and the nut-trees. The plane buds, too, at an early period.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, germinate at the beginning of spring, the holly, for\r\ninstance, the terebinth, the paliurus,[2470] the chesnut, and the\r\nglandiferous trees. On the other hand, the apple is late in budding,\r\nand the cork-tree the very last of all. Some trees germinate twice,\r\nwhether it is that this arises from some exuberant fertility of the\r\nsoil, or from the inviting temperature of the atmosphere; this takes\r\nplace more particularly in the several varieties of the cereals.\r\nExcessive germination, however, has a tendency to weaken and exhaust\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nBesides the spring budding, some trees have naturally another\r\nbudding, which depends upon the influence of their own respective\r\nconstellations,[2471] a theory which we shall find an opportunity of\r\nmore conveniently discussing in the next Book but one.[2472] The winter\r\nbudding takes place at the rising of the Eagle, the summer at that of\r\nthe Dog-star, and a third budding[2473] again at that of Arcturus.\r\nSome persons think that these two buddings are common to all trees,\r\nbut that they are to be remarked more particularly in the fig, the\r\nvine, and the pomegranate; seeing that, when this is the case, the crop\r\nof figs, in Thessaly and Macedonia more particularly, is remarkably\r\nabundant: but it is in Egypt more especially that illustrations of this\r\nvast abundance are to be met with. All the trees in general, when they\r\nhave once begun to germinate, proceed continuously with it; the robur,\r\nhowever, the fir-tree, and the larch germinate intermittently, ceasing\r\nthrice, and as many times[2474] beginning to bud again, and hence it is\r\nthat they shed the scales of their bark[2475] three several times; a\r\nthing that takes place with all trees during the period of germination,\r\nthe outer coat of the tree bursting while it is budding.\r\n\r\nWith these last trees the first budding takes place[2476] at the\r\nbeginning of spring, and lasts about fifteen days; and they germinate a\r\nsecond time when the sun is passing through the sign of Gemini: hence\r\nit is that we see the points of the first buds pushed upwards by those\r\nbeneath, a joint marking the place where they unite.[2477] The third\r\ngermination of these trees takes place at the summer solstice, and\r\nlasts no more than seven days: at this period we may very distinctly\r\ndetect the articulations by which the buds are joined to one another\r\nas they grow. The vine is the only tree that buds twice; the first\r\ntime when it first puts forth the grape, and the second time when the\r\ngrape comes to maturity. In the trees which do not blossom there is\r\nonly the budding, and then the gradual ripening of the fruit. Some\r\ntrees blossom while they are budding, and pass rapidly through that\r\nperiod; but the fruit is slow in coming to maturity, as in the vine,\r\nfor instance. Other trees, again, blossom and bud but late, while the\r\nfruit comes to maturity with great rapidity, the mulberry,[2478] for\r\nexample, which is the very last to bud of all the cultivated trees, and\r\nthen only when the cold weather is gone: for this reason it has been\r\npronounced the wisest among the trees. But in this, the germination,\r\nwhen it has once begun, bursts forth all over the tree at the very same\r\nmoment; so much so, indeed, that it is accomplished in a single night,\r\nand even with a noise that may be audibly heard.[2479]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—IN WHAT ORDER THE TREES BLOSSOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the trees which, as we have already stated,[2480] bud in winter\r\nat the rising of the Eagle, the almond blossoms the first of all, in\r\nthe month of January[2481] namely, while by March the fruit is well\r\ndeveloped. Next to it in blossoming is the plum[2482] of Armenia,\r\nand then the tuber and the early peach,[2483] the first two being\r\nexotics, and the latter forced by the agency of cultivation. Among\r\nthe forest trees, the first that blossoms in the course of nature is\r\nthe elder,[2484] which has the most pith of any, and the male cornel,\r\nwhich has none[2485] at all. Among the cultivated trees we next have\r\nthe apple, and immediately after—so much so, indeed, that it would\r\nalmost appear that they blossom simultaneously—the pear, the cherry,\r\nand the plum. Next to these is the laurel, and then the cypress, and\r\nafter that the pomegranate and the fig: the vine, too, and the olive\r\nare budding when these last trees are in flower, the period of their\r\nconception[2486] being the rising of the Vergiliæ,[2487] that being\r\ntheir constellation.[2488] As for the vine, it blossoms at the summer\r\nsolstice, and the olive begins to do so a little later. All blossoms\r\nremain on the trees seven days, and never fall sooner; some, indeed,\r\nfall later, but none remain on more than twice seven days. The blossoms\r\nare always off before the eighth day[2489] of the ides of July, the\r\nperiod of the prevalence of the Etesian[2490] winds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43. (26.)—AT WHAT PERIOD EACH TREE BEARS FRUIT. THE CORNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon some trees the fruit does not follow immediately upon the fall of\r\nthe blossom. The cornel[2491] about the summer solstice puts forth a\r\nfruit that is white at first, and after that the colour of blood. The\r\nfemale[2492] of this tree, after autumn, bears a sour berry, which no\r\nanimal will touch; its wood, too, is spongy and quite useless, while,\r\non the other hand, that of the male tree is one of the very strongest\r\nand hardest[2493] woods known: so great a difference do we find in\r\ntrees belonging to the same species. The terebinth, the maple, and the\r\nash produce their seed at harvest-time, while the nut-trees, the apple,\r\nand the pear, with the exception of the winter or the more early kinds,\r\nbear fruit in autumn. The glandiferous trees bear at a still later\r\nperiod, the setting of the Vergiliæ,[2494] with the exception of the\r\næsculus,[2495] which bears in the autumn only; while some kinds of the\r\napple and the pear, and the cork-tree, bear fruit at the beginning of\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe fir puts forth blossoms of a saffron colour about the summer\r\nsolstice, and the seed is ripe just after the setting of the Vergiliæ.\r\nThe pine and the pitch-tree germinate about fifteen days before the\r\nfir, but their seed is not ripe till after the setting of the Vergiliæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—TREES WHICH BEAR THE WHOLE YEAR. TREES WHICH HAVE ON THEM THE\r\nFRUIT OF THREE YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe citron-tree,[2496] the juniper, and the holm-oak are looked upon as\r\nhaving fruit on them the whole year through, and upon these trees we\r\nsee the new fruit hanging along with that of the preceding year. The\r\npine, however, is the most remarkable of them all; for it has upon it\r\nat the same moment the fruit that is hastening to maturity, the fruit\r\nthat is to come to maturity in the ensuing year, and the fruit that is\r\nto ripen the next year but one.[2497] Indeed, there is no tree that is\r\nmore eager to develope its resources; for in the same month in which\r\na nut is plucked from it, another will ripen in the same place; the\r\narrangement being such, that there is no month in which the nuts of\r\nthis tree are not ripening. Those nuts which split while still upon the\r\ntree, are known by the name of azaniæ;[2498] they are productive of\r\ninjury to the others, if not removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—TREES WHICH BEAR NO FRUIT: TREES LOOKED UPON AS ILL-OMENED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only ones among all the trees that bear nothing whatever, not so\r\nmuch as any seed even, are the tamarisk,[2499] which is used only for\r\nmaking brooms, the poplar,[2500] the alder, the Atinian elm,[2501] and\r\nthe alaternus,[2502] which has a leaf between that of the holm-oak\r\nand the olive. Those trees are regarded as sinister,[2503] and are\r\nconsidered inauspicious, which are never propagated from seed, and\r\nbear no fruit. Cremutius informs us, that this tree, being the one\r\nupon which Phyllis[2504] hanged herself, is never green. Those trees\r\nwhich produce a gum open of themselves after germination: the gum never\r\nthickens until after the fruit has been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—TREES WHICH LOSE THEIR FRUIT OR FLOWERS MOST READILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung trees are unproductive[2505] so long as they are growing. The\r\nfruits which fall most readily before they come to maturity are the\r\ndate, the fig, the almond, the apple, the pear, and the pomegranate,\r\nwhich last tree is also very apt to lose its blossom through excessive\r\ndews and hoar frosts. For this reason it is, too, that the growers\r\nbend the branches of the pomegranate, lest, from being straight, they\r\nmay receive and retain the moisture that is so injurious to them. The\r\npear and the almond,[2506] even if it should not rain, but a south\r\nwind happen to blow or the weather become cloudy, are apt to lose\r\ntheir blossoms, and their first fruit as well, if, after the blossom\r\nhas fallen, there is a continuance of such weather. But it is the\r\nwillow that loses its seed the most speedily of all, long, indeed,\r\nbefore it is ripe; hence it is that Homer has given it the epithet of\r\n“fruit-losing.”[2507] Succeeding ages, however, have given to this term\r\nan interpretation conformable to their own wicked practices, it being a\r\nwell-known fact that the seed of the willow has the effect of producing\r\nbarrenness in females.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, however, Nature has employed her usual foresight,\r\nbestowing but little care upon the seed of a tree which is produced so\r\neasily, and propagated by slips. There is, however, it is said, one\r\nvariety of willow,[2508] the seed of which arrives at maturity: it is\r\nfound in the Isle of Crete, at the descent from the grotto of Jupiter:\r\nthe seed is unsightly and ligneous, and in size about as large as a\r\nchick-pea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—TREES WHICH ARE UNPRODUCTIVE IN CERTAIN PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain trees also become unproductive, owing to some fault in the\r\nlocality, such, for instance, as a coppice-wood in the island of\r\nParos, which produces nothing at all: in the Isle of Rhodes, too, the\r\npeach-trees[2509] never do anything more than blossom. This distinction\r\nmay arise also from the sex; and when such is the case, it is the\r\nmale[2510] tree that never produces. Some authors, however, making a\r\ntransposition, assert that it is the male trees only that are prolific.\r\nBarrenness may also arise from a tree being too thickly covered with\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48.—THE MODE IN WHICH TREES BEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome among the fruit-trees[2511] bear on both the sides of the branches\r\nand the summit, the pear, for instance, the fig-tree, and the myrtle.\r\nIn other respects the trees are pretty nearly of a similar nature to\r\nthe cereals, for in them we find the ear growing from the summit, while\r\nin the leguminous varieties the pod grows from the sides. The palm, as\r\nwe have already[2512] stated, is the only one that has fruit hanging\r\ndown in bunches enclosed in capsules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—TREES IN WHICH THE FRUIT APPEARS BEFORE THE LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other trees, again, bear their fruit beneath the leaves, for the\r\npurpose of protection, with the exception of the fig, the leaf of\r\nwhich is very large, and gives a great abundance of shade; hence it is\r\nthat we find the fruit placed above it; in addition to which, the leaf\r\nmakes its appearance after the fruit. There is said to be a remarkable\r\npeculiarity connected with one species of fig that is found in Cilicia,\r\nCyprus, and Hellas; the fruit grows beneath the leaves, while at the\r\nsame time the green abortive fruit, that never reaches maturity, is\r\nseen growing on the top of them. There is also a tree that produces an\r\nearly fig, known to the Athenians by the name of “prodromos.”[2513] In\r\nthe Laconian varieties of this fruit more particularly, we find trees\r\nthat bear two crops[2514] in the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50. (27.)—TREES THAT BEAR TWO CROPS IN A YEAR. TREES THAT BEAR\r\nTHREE CROPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the island of Cea there are wild figs that bear three times in\r\none year. By the first crop the one that succeeds is summoned forth,\r\nand by that the third. It is by the agency of this last crop that\r\ncaprification[2515] is performed. In the wild fig, too, the fruit\r\ngrows on the opposite side of the leaves. There are some pears and\r\napples, too, that bear two crops in the year, while there are some\r\nearly varieties also. The wild apple bears twice[2516] in the year,\r\nits second crop coming on after the rising of Arcturus,[2517] in sunny\r\nlocalities more particularly. There are vines, too, that will even bear\r\nthree times in the year, a circumstance that has procured for them the\r\nname of “frantic”[2518] vines. On these we see grapes just ripening,\r\nothers beginning to swell, and others, again, in blossom, all at the\r\nsame moment.\r\n\r\nM. Varro[2519] informs us, that there was formerly at Smyrna,\r\nnear[2520] the Temple of the Mother of the Gods, a vine that bore two\r\ncrops in the year, as also an apple-tree of a similar nature in the\r\nterritory of Consentia. This, however, is constantly to be witnessed\r\nin the territory of Tacapa,[2521] in Africa, of which we shall have\r\nto speak more fully on another occasion,[2522] so remarkable is the\r\nfertility of the soil. The cypress also bears three times in the year,\r\nfor its berries are gathered in the months of January, May, and\r\nSeptember, being all three of different size.\r\n\r\nThere are also certain peculiarities observed in the different modes\r\nin which the trees bear their fruit, the arbutus and the quercus being\r\nmost fruitful in the upper part, the walnut and the marisca[2523] fig\r\nin the lower. All trees, the older they grow, the more early they bear,\r\nand this more particularly in sunny spots and where the soil is not\r\nover-rich. All the forest-trees are slower in bringing their fruit to\r\nmaturity; and indeed, in some of them the fruit never becomes fully\r\nripe.[2524] Those trees, too, about the roots of which the earth is\r\nploughed or broken and loosened, bring their fruit to maturity more\r\nspeedily than those in which this has been neglected; by this process\r\nthey are also rendered more fruitful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—WHICH TREES BECOME OLD WITH THE GREATEST RAPIDITY, AND WHICH\r\nMOST SLOWLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are great differences also in trees in respect to age. The\r\nalmond and the pear[2525] are the most fruitful when old, which is\r\nthe case also with the glandiferous trees and a certain species of\r\nfig. Others, again, are most prolific when young, though the fruit is\r\nlater in coming to maturity, a thing particularly to be observed in\r\nthe vine; for in those that are old the wine is of better quality,\r\nwhile the produce of the younger trees is given in greater abundance.\r\nThe apple-tree becomes old very early, and the fruit which it produces\r\nwhen old is of inferior quality, being of smaller size and very liable\r\nto be attacked by maggots: indeed, these insects will breed in the\r\ntree itself. The fig is the only one of all the fruit-trees that is\r\nsubmitted to any process with the view of expediting the ripening of\r\nthe fruit,[2526] a marvellous thing, indeed, that a greater value\r\nshould be set upon produce that comes out of its proper season!\r\nAll trees which bear their fruit before the proper time become\r\nprematurely[2527] old; indeed, some of them wither and die all of a\r\nsudden, being utterly exhausted by the too favourable influence of the\r\nweather, a thing that happens to the vine more particularly.\r\n\r\n(28.) On the other hand, the mulberry becomes aged[2528] but very\r\nslowly, and is never exhausted by its crops. Those trees, too, the wood\r\nof which is variegated, arrive at old age but slowly,—the palm, the\r\nmaple, and the poplar, for instance.\r\n\r\n(29.) Trees grow old more rapidly when the earth is ploughed and\r\nloosened about the[2529] roots; forest trees at a later period.\r\nSpeaking in general terms, we may say that care employed in the culture\r\nof trees seems to promote their fertility, while increased fertility\r\naccelerates old age. Hence it is that the carefully tended trees are\r\nthe first to blossom, and the first to bud; in a word, are the most\r\nprecocious in every respect: but all natural productions which are in\r\nany way weakened are more susceptible of atmospheric influences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—TREES WHICH BEAR VARIOUS PRODUCTS. CRATÆGUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany trees bear more than one production, a fact which we have already\r\nmentioned[2530] when speaking of the glandiferous trees. In the number\r\nof these there is the laurel, which bears its own peculiar kind of\r\ngrape, and more particularly the barren laurel,[2531] which bears\r\nnothing else; for which reason it is looked upon by some persons as the\r\nmale tree. The filbert, too, bears catkins, which are hard and compact,\r\nbut of no use[2532] whatever.\r\n\r\n(30.) But it is the box-tree that supplies us with the greatest number\r\nof products, not only its seed, but a berry also, known by the name of\r\ncratægum;[2533] while on the north side it produces mistletoe, and on\r\nthe south hyphear; two products of which I shall shortly have to speak\r\nmore[2534] at length. Sometimes, indeed, this tree has all four of\r\nthese products growing upon it at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53.—DIFFERENCES IN TREES IN RESPECT OF THE TRUNKS AND BRANCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome trees are of a simple form, and have but a single trunk rising\r\nfrom the root, together with numerous branches; such as the olive, for\r\ninstance, the fig, and the vine; others again are of a shrubby nature,\r\nsuch as the paliurus,[2535] the myrtle, and the filbert; which last,\r\nindeed, is all the better, and the more abundant its fruit, the more\r\nnumerous its branches. In some trees, again, there is no trunk at all,\r\nas is the case with one species of box,[2536] and the lotus[2537] of\r\nthe parts beyond sea. Some trees are bifurcated, while there are some\r\nthat branch out into as many as five parts. Others, again, divide in\r\nthe trunk but have no branches, as in the case of the elder; while\r\nothers have no division in the trunk but throw out branches, such as\r\nthe pitch-tree, for instance.\r\n\r\nIn some trees the branches are symmetrically arranged, the pitch-tree\r\nand the fir, for example; while with others they are dispersed without\r\nany order or regularity, as in the robur, the apple, and the pear. In\r\nthe fir the branches are thrown out from the trunk straight upwards,\r\npointing to the sky, and not drooping downwards from the sides of the\r\ntrunk. It is a singular thing,[2538] but this tree will die if the ends\r\nof its branches are cut, though, if taken off altogether, no bad effect\r\nis produced. If it is cut, too, below the place where the branches\r\nwere, the part of the tree which is left will continue to live; but if,\r\non the other hand, the top only of the tree is removed, the whole of it\r\nwill die.\r\n\r\nSome trees, again, throw out branches from the roots, the elm for\r\nexample; while others are branchy at the top, the pine for instance,\r\nand the lotus[2539] or Grecian bean, the fruit of which, though wild,\r\nresembles the cherry very closely, and is called the lotus at Rome,\r\non account of its sweetness. For sheltering houses these trees are\r\nmore particularly esteemed, as they throw out their branches to a\r\nconsiderable distance, from a short trunk, thus affording a very\r\nextensive shade, and very frequently encroaching upon the neighbouring\r\nmansions. There is no tree, however, the shade afforded by which is\r\nless long-lived than this, and when it loses its leaves in winter, it\r\naffords no shelter from the sun. No tree has a more sightly bark, or\r\none which has greater attractions for the eye; or branches which are\r\nlonger, stouter, or more numerous; indeed, one might almost look upon\r\nthem as forming so many trees. The bark[2540] of it is used for dyeing\r\nskins, and the root for colouring wool.\r\n\r\nThe branches of the apple-tree have a peculiar conformation; knots are\r\nformed which resemble the muzzles[2541] of wild beasts, several smaller\r\nones being united to a larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54.—THE BRANCHES OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the branches are barren, and do not germinate; this takes place\r\neither from a natural deficiency of strength, or else some injury\r\nreceived in consequence of having been cut, and the cicatrix impeding\r\nthe natural functions. The same that the branch is in the trees that\r\nspread out, is the eye[2542] in the vine, and the joint in the reed.\r\nAll trees are naturally the thickest in the parts that are nearest the\r\nground. The fir, the larch, the palm, the cypress, and the elm, and,\r\nindeed, every tree that has but a single trunk, develope themselves\r\nin their remarkable height. Among the branchy trees the cherry is\r\nsometimes[2543] found to yield a beam forty cubits in length by two in\r\nthickness throughout. Some trees divide into branches from the very\r\nground, as in the apple-tree, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55. (31.)—THE BARK OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some trees the bark[2544] is thin, as in the laurel and the lime; in\r\nothers, again, it is thick, as in the robur; in some it is smooth, as\r\nin the apple and the fig, while in the robur and the palm it is rough:\r\nin all kinds it becomes more wrinkled when the tree is old. In some\r\ntrees the bark bursts spontaneously, as in the vine for instance, while\r\nin others it falls off even, as we see in the apple and the arbutus. In\r\nthe cork-tree and the poplar, the bark is substantial and fleshy; in\r\nthe vine and the reed it is membraneous. In the cherry it is similar to\r\nthe coats of the papyrus, while in the vine, the lime, and the fir, it\r\nis composed of numerous layers. In others, again, it is single, the fig\r\nand the reed for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—THE ROOTS OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are great differences, too, in the roots of trees. In the fig,\r\nthe robur, and the plane, they are numerous; in the apple they are\r\nshort and thin, while in the fir and the larch they are single; and by\r\nthis single root is the tree supported, although we find some small\r\nfibres thrown out from it laterally. They are thick and unequal in\r\nthe laurel and the olive, in which last they are branchy also; while\r\nin the robur they are solid and fleshy.[2545] The robur, too, throws\r\nits roots downwards to a very considerable depth. Indeed, if we are\r\nto believe Virgil,[2546] the æsculus has a root that descends as deep\r\ninto the earth as the height to which the trunk ascends in the air.\r\nThe roots of the olive, the apple, and the cypress, creep almost upon\r\nthe very surface: in some trees they run straight and horizontally,\r\nas in the laurel and the olive; while in others they have a sinuous\r\ncourse—the fig for example. In some trees the roots are bristling with\r\nsmall filaments, as in the fir, and many of the forest trees; the\r\nmountaineers cut off these fine filaments, and weave with them very\r\nhandsome flasks,[2547] and various other articles.\r\n\r\nSome writers say that the roots of trees do not descend below the level\r\nto which the sun’s heat is able to penetrate; which, of course, depends\r\nupon the nature of the soil, whether it happens to be thin or dense.\r\nThis, however, I look upon[2548] as a mistake: and, in fact, we find\r\nit stated by some authors that a fir was transplanted, the roots of\r\nwhich had penetrated eight cubits in depth, and even then the whole of\r\nit was not dug up, it being torn asunder.[2549] The citrus has a root\r\nthat goes the very deepest of all, and is of great extent; next after\r\nit come the plane, the robur, and the various glandiferous trees. In\r\nsome trees, the laurel for instance, the roots are more tenacious of\r\nlife the nearer they are to the surface: hence, when the trunk withers,\r\nit is cut down, and the tree shoots again with redoubled vigour. Some\r\nthink that the shorter the roots are, the more rapidly the tree decays;\r\na supposition which is plainly contradicted by the fig, the root of\r\nwhich is among the very largest, while the tree becomes aged at a\r\nremarkably early period. I regard also as incorrect what some authors\r\nhave stated, as to the roots of trees diminishing[2550] when they are\r\nold; for I once saw an ancient oak, uprooted by a storm, the roots of\r\nwhich covered a jugerum of ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57.—TREES WHICH HAVE GROWN SPONTANEOUSLY FROM THE GROUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a not uncommon thing for trees when uprooted to receive new\r\nstrength when replanted, the earth about their roots forming a sort of\r\ncicatrix[2551] there. This is particularly the case with the plane,\r\nwhich, from the density of its branches, presents a remarkably broad\r\nsurface to the wind: when this happens, the branches are cut off, and\r\nthe tree, thus lightened, is replaced in its furrow: this, too, has\r\nalso been done before now with the walnut, the olive, and many others.\r\n\r\n(32.) We have many instances cited also of trees falling to the ground\r\nwithout there being any storm or other perceptible cause, but merely by\r\nway of portentous omen, and then rising again of themselves. A prodigy\r\nof this nature happened to the citizens of Rome during their wars\r\nwith the Cimbri: at Nuceria, in the grove consecrated to Juno, an elm\r\ninclined to such a degree, even after the top had been cut off, as to\r\noverhang the altar there, but it afterwards recovered itself to such an\r\nextent as to blossom immediately: it was from that very moment, too,\r\nthat the majesty of the Roman people began to flourish once again after\r\nit had been laid low by disaster and defeat. A similar circumstance is\r\nsaid to have taken place also at Philippi, where a willow, which had\r\nfallen down, and the top of which had been taken off, rose again; and\r\nat Stagira, in the Museum[2552] there, where the same thing occurred\r\nto a white poplar; all which events were looked upon as favourable\r\nomens. But what is most wonderful of all, is the fact that a plane, at\r\nAntandros, resumed its original position even after its sides had been\r\nrough-hewn all round with the adze,[2553] and took root again: it was a\r\ntree fifteen cubits long, and four ulnæ in thickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—HOW TREES GROW SPONTANEOUSLY—DIVERSITIES IN THEIR NATURE, THE\r\nSAME TREES NOT GROWING EVERYWHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trees which we owe to Nature are produced in three different ways;\r\nspontaneously, by seed sown, or by a slip which throws out a root. Art\r\nhas multiplied the methods of reproduction, as we shall have occasion\r\nto state in its own appropriate Book:[2554] at present our sole subject\r\nis the operations of Nature, and the manifold and marvellous methods\r\nshe adopts. The trees, as we have already stated,[2555] do not all of\r\nthem grow in every locality, nor will they live, many of them,[2556]\r\nwhen transplanted: this happens sometimes through a natural antipathy\r\non the part of the tree, sometimes through an innate stubbornness, but\r\nmore frequently through the weakness of the variety so transplanted,\r\neither the climate being unfavourable, or the soil repulsive to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59.—PLANTS THAT WILL NOT GROW IN CERTAIN PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBalsamum[2557] will grow nowhere but [in[2558] Judæa]: and the citron\r\nof Assyria refuses to bear fruit in any other country. The palm, too,\r\nwill not grow everywhere, and even if it does grow in some places, it\r\nwill not bear: sometimes, indeed, it may make a show and promise of\r\nbearing, but even then its fruit comes to nothing, it seeming to have\r\nborne them thus far in spite of itself. The cinnamon[2559] shrub has\r\nnot sufficient strength to acclimatize itself in the countries that\r\nlie in the vicinity of Syria. Amomum,[2560] too, and nard,[2561] those\r\nmost delicate of perfumes, will not endure the carriage from India\r\nto Arabia, nor yet conveyance by sea; indeed, King Seleucus did make\r\nthe attempt, but in vain. But what is more particularly wonderful,\r\nis the fact that most of the trees by care may be prevailed upon to\r\nlive when transplanted; for sometimes the soil may be so managed as\r\nto nourish the foreigner and give support to the stranger plant;\r\nclimate, however, can never be changed. The pepper-tree[2562] will\r\nlive in Italy, and cassia[2563] in the northern climates even, while\r\nthe incense-tree[2564] has been known to live in Lydia: but how are\r\nwe to impart to these productions the requisite warmth of the sun, in\r\norder to make all the crude juices go off by evaporation, and ripen the\r\nresins that distil from them?\r\n\r\nNearly as great a marvel, too, is the fact that the nature of the tree\r\nmay be modified by circumstances, and yet the tree itself be none the\r\nless vigorous in its growth. Nature originally gave the cedar[2565] to\r\nlocalities of burning heat, and yet we find it growing in the mountains\r\nof Lycia and Phrygia. She made the laurel, too, averse to cold, and\r\nyet there is no tree that grows in greater abundance on Mount Olympus.\r\nAt the city of Panticapæum, in the vicinity of the Cimmerian Bosporus,\r\nKing Mithridates and the inhabitants of the place used every possible\r\nendeavour, with a view to certain religious ceremonies, to cultivate\r\nthe myrtle[2566] and the laurel: they could not succeed, however,\r\nalthough trees abound there which require a hot climate, such as the\r\npomegranate and the fig, as well as apples and pears of the most\r\napproved quality. In the same country, too, the trees that belong to\r\nthe colder climates, such as the pine, the fir, and the pitch-tree,\r\nrefuse to grow. But why go search for instances in Pontus? In the\r\nvicinity of Rome itself it is only with the greatest difficulty[2567]\r\nthat the cherry and the chesnut will grow, and the peach-tree, too, at\r\nTusculum: the Greek nut, too, is grown there from grafts only at a cost\r\nof considerable labour, while Tarracina abounds with whole woods of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60. (33.)—THE CYPRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cypress[2568] is an exotic, and has been reckoned one of the\r\ntrees that are naturalized with the greatest difficulty; so much so,\r\nindeed, that Cato[2569] has expatiated upon it at greater length and\r\nmore frequently than any of the others. This tree is naturally of a\r\nstubborn[2570] disposition, bears a fruit that is utterly useless,\r\na berry that causes a wry[2571] face when tasted, and a leaf that is\r\nbitter: it also gives out a disagreeable pungent smell,[2572] and its\r\nshade is far from agreeable. The wood that it furnishes is but scanty,\r\nso much so indeed, that it may be almost regarded as little more than a\r\nshrub. This tree is sacred to Pluto, and hence it is used as a sign of\r\nmourning[2573] placed at the entrance of a house: the female[2574] tree\r\nis for a long time barren. The pyramidal appearance that it presents\r\nhas caused it not to be rejected, but for a long time it was only used\r\nfor marking the intervals between rows of pines: at the present day,\r\nhowever, it is clipped and trained to form hedge-rows, or else is\r\nthinned and lengthened out in the various designs[2575] employed in\r\nornamental gardening, and which represent scenes of hunting, fleets,\r\nand various other objects: these it covers with a thin small leaf,\r\nwhich is always green.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of the cypress; the one[2576] tapering and\r\npyramidal, and which is known as the female; while the male tree[2577]\r\nthrows its branches straight out from the body, and is often pruned\r\nand employed as a rest for the vine. Both the male and the female are\r\npermitted to throw out their branches, which are cut and employed for\r\npoles and props, being worth, after thirteen years’ growth, a denarius\r\na-piece. In respect of income, a plantation of cypress is remarkably\r\nprofitable, so much so, indeed, that it was a saying in old times that\r\na cypress-wood is a dowry for a daughter.[2578] The native country\r\nof this tree is the island of Crete, although Cato[2579] calls it\r\nTarentine, Tarentum being the first place, I suppose, in which it was\r\nnaturalized: in the island of Ænaria,[2580] also, if the cypress is\r\ncut down, it will grow again[2581] from the root. But, in the Isle\r\nof Crete, in whatever place the earth is moved, this tree will shoot\r\nup[2582] of its own natural vigour, and immediately appear above the\r\nsoil; indeed, in that island there is no occasion even to solicit\r\nthe soil, for it grows spontaneously there, on the mountains of Ida\r\nmore particularly, and those known as the White Mountains. On the\r\nvery summit of these elevations, from which the snows never depart,\r\nwe find the cypress growing in great abundance; a thing that is truly\r\nmarvellous—seeing that, in other countries, it will only grow in warm\r\nlocalities; from which it would appear to have a great dislike to its\r\nnative climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 61.—THAT THE EARTH OFTEN BEARS PRODUCTIONS WHICH IT HAS NEVER\r\nBORNE BEFORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not only the quality of the soil and the unchanging influences\r\nof the climate that affect the nature of trees, but wet and showery\r\nweather also, temporarily at least. Indeed, the torrents very often\r\nbring down with them seeds, and sometimes we find those of unknown\r\nkinds even floating along. This took place in the territory of\r\nCyrenaica, at the period when laser was first grown there, as we shall\r\nhave occasion to mention when we speak of the nature of the various\r\nherbs.[2583] A forest, too, sprang[2584] up in the vicinity of the city\r\nof Cyrene, just after a shower of rain, of a dense, pitchy nature,\r\nabout the year of the City of Rome 430.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 62. (34.)—THE IVY.—TWENTY VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that the ivy now grows in Asia,[2585] though\r\nTheophrastus[2586] has denied that such is the fact, and asserts that\r\nit grows nowhere in India, except upon Mount Meros.[2587] He says, too,\r\nthat Harpalus used every possible exertion to naturalize it in Media,\r\nbut to no purpose; and that Alexander, in consequence of the rarity of\r\nthis plant, had himself crowned[2588] with it, after the example of\r\nFather Liber, when returning victorious with his army from India: and\r\nat the present day even, it is used to decorate the thyrsus of that\r\ngod, and the casques and bucklers employed by the nations of Thrace in\r\ntheir sacred ceremonials. The ivy is injurious[2589] to all trees and\r\nplants, and makes its way through tombs and walls; it forms a haunt\r\nmuch frequented by serpents, for its refreshing coolness; so that it is\r\na matter for astonishment that there should have been such remarkable\r\nveneration for this plant.\r\n\r\nThe two principal kinds in the ivy, as in other plants, are the male\r\ntree and the female.[2590] The male is said to have a larger trunk\r\nthan the female, and a leaf that is harder and more unctuous, with a\r\nflower nearly approaching to purple: indeed, the flower of both the\r\nmale and female tree strongly resembles the wild[2591]-rose, were it\r\nnot destitute of smell. Each of these kinds of ivy is divided into\r\nthree other varieties; the white[2592] ivy, the black,[2593] and a\r\nthird known as the helix.[2594] These varieties are again subdivided\r\ninto others, as there is one in which the fruit only is white, and\r\nanother in which it is only the leaf that is so. In those which have\r\na white fruit, the berry in some cases is closely packed and large,\r\nthe clusters, which are known as “corymbi,” being of a spherical form.\r\nSo, too, with the selenitium, which has a smaller berry, and fewer\r\nclusters; and the same is the case with the black ivy. One kind has a\r\nblack seed, and another a seed of a saffron[2595] colour—it is this\r\nlast that poets use for their chaplets,[2596] and the leaves of it\r\nare not so black as in the other kinds: by some it is known as the\r\nivy of Nysa, by others as that of Bacchus:[2597] it is the one that\r\namong the black varieties has the largest clusters of all. Some of\r\nthe Greek writers even distinguish in this last kind two varieties,\r\naccording to the colour of the berries, the erythranum[2598] and the\r\nchrysocarpus.[2599]\r\n\r\nIt is the helix, however, that has the most peculiarities of all,\r\nand in the appearance of the leaf more particularly, which is small,\r\nangular, and of a more elegant shape, the leaf in all the other kinds\r\nbeing plain and simple. It differs, too, in the distance between the\r\njoints, and in being barren more especially, as it never bears fruit.\r\nSome authors, however, think that this difference exists solely in\r\nrespect of age and not of kind, and are of opinion that what is the\r\nhelix when young, becomes the ordinary ivy when old. This, however,\r\nis clearly proved to be an error upon their part, for we find more\r\nvarieties of the helix than one, and three in particular—that of a\r\ngrass-green colour, which is the most abundant of all, the kind with\r\na white leaf, and a third, which is parti-coloured, and known as\r\nthe Thracian helix. In that of a grass-green colour, the leaves are\r\nsmaller, more closely packed together, and symmetrically arranged;\r\nwhile in the other kinds the features are altogether different. In the\r\nparti-coloured kind, also, one variety has a smaller leaf than usual,\r\nsimilarly arranged, and lying closer together, while in the other none\r\nof these features are observed. The leaves, too, are either greater or\r\nsmaller and differ in the disposition of the spots upon them, and in\r\nthe white helix some of them are whiter than others: the grass-green\r\nvariety, however, is the one that grows to the greatest height.\r\n\r\nThe white helix is in the habit of killing trees by depriving them of\r\ntheir juices, and increases to such a degree of density as to be quite\r\na tree itself. Its characteristics are, a very large, broad, leaf, and\r\nprojecting buds, which in all the other kinds are bent inwards; its\r\nclusters, too, stand out erect. Although, too, all the ivies have arms\r\nthat throw out a root, those of this variety are particularly branchy\r\nand strong; next to it in strength, are those of the black ivy.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiarity of the white ivy to throw out arms from the middle\r\nof the leaves, with which it invariably embraces any object that may be\r\non either side of it; this is the case, too, with walls, even though it\r\nshould not be able to clasp them. If the trunk is cut across in ever so\r\nmany places, it will still live and thrive, having as many fresh roots\r\nas it has arms, by means of which it ensures safety and impunity, while\r\nat the same time it sucks and strangles the trees to which it clings.\r\nThere are great differences also in the fruit of both the white ivy\r\nand the black; for in some of them the berry is so bitter that birds\r\nwill not touch it. There is an ivy also which grows upright,[2600] and\r\nstands without any support; being the only one that does so among all\r\nthe varieties, it has thence obtained the distinctive name of “cissos.”\r\nThe chamæcissos,[2601] on the other hand, is never found except\r\ncreeping upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 63. (35.)—THE SMILAX.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery similar to the ivy is a plant which first came from Cilicia,\r\nbut is now more commonly found in Greece, and known by the name of\r\nsmilax.[2602] It has numerous thick stalks covered with joints, and\r\nthorny branches of a shrub-like form: the leaf resembles that of the\r\nivy, but is not angular, while from the foot-stalk it throws out\r\ntendrils; the flower is white, and has the smell of the lily. It bears\r\nclusters like those of the wild vine and not the ivy, and of a reddish\r\ncolour. The larger berries contain three stones, the smaller but one\r\nonly: these berries are black and hard. This plant is looked upon as\r\nill-omened, and is consequently banished from all sacred rites, and\r\nis allowed to form no part of chaplets; having received this mournful\r\ncharacter from the maiden Smilax, who upon her love being slighted by\r\nthe youth Crocus, was transformed into this shrub. The common people,\r\nbeing mostly ignorant of this, not unfrequently take it for ivy, and\r\npollute their festivities with its presence; for who, in fact, is\r\nunaware that the ivy is used as a chaplet by poets, as also by Father\r\nLiber and Silenus? Tablets are made[2603] of the wood of the smilax,\r\nand it is a peculiarity of this wood to give out a slight sound,[2604]\r\nif held close to the ear. It is said that ivy is remarkably efficacious\r\nfor testing wine, and that a vessel made of this wood will let the wine\r\npass through it, while the water will remain behind, if there has been\r\nany mixed with it.[2605]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 64. (36.)—WATER PLANTS: THE RUSH: TWENTY-EIGHT VARIETIES OF THE\r\nREED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong those plants which thrive best in cold localities, it will be\r\nonly proper to mention the aquatic shrubs.[2606] In the first rank, we\r\nfind the reed, equally indispensable for the emergencies of war and\r\npeace, and used among the appliances[2607] of luxury even. The northern\r\nnations make use of reeds for roofing their houses, and the stout\r\nthatch thus formed will last for centuries even; in other countries,\r\ntoo, they make light vaulted ceilings with them. Reeds are employed,\r\ntoo, for writing upon paper, those of Egypt more particularly, which\r\nhave a close affinity to the papyrus: the most esteemed, however, are\r\nthe reeds of Cnidos, and those which grow in Asia, on the margin of the\r\nAnaitic Lake[2608] there.\r\n\r\nThe reed of our country is naturally of a more fungous nature, being\r\nformed of a spongy cartilage, which is hollow within, and covered by a\r\nthin, dry, woody coat without; it easily breaks into splinters, which\r\nare remarkably sharp at the edge. In other respects, it is of a thin,\r\ngraceful shape, articulated with joints, and tapering gradually towards\r\nthe top, which ends in a thick, hairy tuft. This tuft is not without\r\nits uses, as it is employed for filling the beds used in taverns,\r\nin place of feathers; or else, when it has assumed a more ligneous\r\nconsistency, it is pounded, as we see done among the Belgæ, and\r\ninserted between the joints of ships, to close the seams, a thing that\r\nit does most effectually, being more tenacious than glue, and adhering\r\nmore firmly than pitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 65.—REEDS USED FOR ARROWS, AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF WRITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is by the aid of the reed[2609] that the nations of the East decide\r\ntheir wars; fixing in it a barbed point, they inflict a wound from\r\nwhich the arrow cannot be withdrawn. By the addition of feathers they\r\naccelerate the flight of this instrument of death, and the weapon, if\r\nit breaks in the wound, furnishes the combatants with a weapon afresh.\r\nWith these missiles the warriors darken the very rays of the sun.[2610]\r\nIt is for this reason more particularly that they desire a clear and\r\nserene sky, and hold in abhorrence all windy and rainy weather, which\r\nhas the effect of compelling them, in spite of themselves, to be at\r\npeace with one another.\r\n\r\nIf a person were carefully to enumerate the peoples of Æthiopia, Egypt,\r\nArabia, India, Scythia, Bactria, and Sarmatia, together with all the\r\nnumerous peoples of the East, and the vast realms of the Parthians, he\r\nwould find that fully one-half of mankind throughout the whole world\r\nlive under a dominion imposed by the agency of the arrow. It was their\r\nsurpassing excellence in this arm that so ennobled the warriors of\r\nCrete, though in this respect, as well as in all others, Italy has\r\ngained the mastery; there being no reed in existence better adapted for\r\nmaking arrows than that found in the Rhenus, a river of the territory\r\nof Bononia: filled with a greater quantity of pith than any of the\r\nothers, it is light, and easily cleaves the air, while at the same\r\ntime it has sufficient weight to resist the action of the wind; an\r\nadvantage that is not possessed in an equal degree by those employed\r\namong the Belgæ. These advantages, however, are possessed by the most\r\napproved kinds that are found in Crete, although those of India are\r\npreferred; in the opinion of some persons, however, these last are of\r\na totally different nature, for by adding a point to them, the natives\r\nare able to use them as lances even. Indeed, we find that in India the\r\nreed grows to the thickness of a tree, a fact which is proved by the\r\nspecimens which are everywhere to be seen in our temples. The Indians\r\nassure us that in this plant, too, there is the distinction of male and\r\nfemale; the body of the male being more compact, and that of the female\r\nof a larger size. In addition to this, if we can credit the fact, a\r\nsingle compartment between the joints is sufficiently large to answer\r\nthe purposes of a boat.[2611] These reeds are found more particularly\r\non the banks of the river Acesines.\r\n\r\nIn every variety of the reed a single root gives birth to numerous\r\nstems, and if cut down, they will shoot again with increased fecundity.\r\nThe root, which is naturally tenacious of life, is also jointed as well\r\nas the stem. The reeds of India are the only ones in which the leaves\r\nare short; but in all the varieties these leaves take their rise at\r\nthe joints, and surround the stem with a fine tissue about half way\r\nupwards to the next joint, and then leave the stem and droop downwards.\r\nThe reed, as well as the calamus, although rounded, has two sides,\r\nwhich throw out leaves alternately from above the joints, in such a\r\nway that when one springs from the right side, the next issues from\r\nthe joint above it on the left, and so in turns. Branches, too, shoot\r\noccasionally from the stem, being themselves reeds of diminutive growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 66.—FLUTE REEDS: THE REED OF ORCHOMENUS; REEDS USED FOR FOWLING\r\nAND FISHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the reed are numerous. Some are more compact than\r\nothers, thicker at the joints, and with a shorter interval between\r\nthem; while others, again, are less compact, with longer intervals\r\nbetween the joints, and not so straight. Another kind of reed is quite\r\nhollow; it is known as the “syringia,”[2612] and is particularly useful\r\nfor making flutes, having neither pith in it nor any fleshy substance.\r\nThe reed of Orchomenus has a passage in it open from one end to the\r\nother, and is known as the auleticon;[2613] this last is best for\r\nmaking pipes,[2614] the former[2615] for the syrinx. There is another\r\nreed, the wood of which is thicker, and the passage very contracted,\r\nbeing entirely filled with a spongy kind of pith. One kind, again, is\r\nshorter, and another longer, the one thinner, the other more thick.\r\nThat known as the donax, throws out the most shoots, and grows only in\r\nwatery localities; indeed, this is a point which constitutes a very\r\nconsiderable difference, those reeds being greatly preferred which\r\ngrow in a dry soil. The archer’s reed forms a peculiar species, as we\r\nhave already stated;[2616] but that of Crete[2617] has the longest\r\nintervals between the joints, and when subjected to heat is capable of\r\nbeing rendered perfectly pliable[2618] at pleasure. The leaves, too,\r\nconstitute different varieties, not only by their number, but their\r\ncolour also. The reed of Laconia is spotted,[2619] and throws out a\r\ngreater number of shoots at the lower extremities; being very similar\r\nin nature, it is thought, to the reeds that we find growing about\r\nstagnant waters, and unlike those of the rivers, in being covered with\r\nleaves of considerable length; which, climbing upwards, embrace the\r\nstem to a considerable distance above the joints. There is also an\r\nobliquely-spreading reed, which does not shoot upwards to any height,\r\nbut spreads out like a shrub, keeping close to the earth; this reed\r\nis much sought by animals when young, and is known by some persons as\r\nthe elegia.[2620] There is in Italy, too, a substance found in the\r\nmarsh-reeds, called by the name of adarca:[2621] it is only to be found\r\nissuing from the outer skin, below the flossy head of the plant, and is\r\nparticularly beneficial to the teeth, having, in fact, an equal degree\r\nof pungency with mustard.\r\n\r\nThe terms of admiration in which they are spoken of by the ancients\r\ncompels me to enter into some more minute details relative to the\r\nreed-beds of Lake Orchomenus. Characias[2622] was the name given there\r\nto a reed of stout and compact quality, while a thinner one was known\r\nas the plotias; this last was to be found growing on the floating\r\nislands there, while the former grew upon the banks that were covered\r\nby the waters of the lake. A third kind again, which had the name of\r\n“auleticon,” was the same that is now known as the musical pipe[2623]\r\nreed. This reed used to take nine years to grow, as it was for that\r\nperiod that the waters of the lake were continually on the increase;\r\nit used to be looked upon as a prodigy of evil omen, if at the end of\r\nits rise its waters remained overflowing so long as a couple of years;\r\na thing that was observed at the period of the Athenian disasters at\r\nCheronæa, and on various other occasions. This lake has the name of\r\nLebaida, at the part where the river Cephisus enters it.\r\n\r\nWhen this inundation has lasted so long as a year, the reed is found\r\nlarge enough to be available for the purposes of fowling: at this\r\nperiod it used to be called zeugites.[2624] On the other hand, when\r\nthe waters subsided at an earlier period, the reeds were known as\r\nbombyciæ,[2625] being of a more slender form. In this variety, too,\r\nthe leaf of the female plant was broader and whiter than that of the\r\nothers, while that upon which there was little or no down bore the\r\nname of the eunuch reed. The stem of this last variety was used for\r\nthe manufacture of concert[2626] flutes. I must not here pass by in\r\nsilence the marvellous care which the ancients lavished upon these\r\ninstruments, a thing which will, in some measure, plead as an apology\r\nfor the manufacture of them at the present day of silver in preference.\r\nThe reed used to be cut, as it was then looked upon as being in the\r\nbest condition, at the rising of Arcturus;[2627] an usage which\r\nprevailed down to the time of Antigenides, the musician, and while\r\nflute-playing was of a more simple style. Being thus prepared, the\r\nreeds became fit for use in the course of a few years. At that period\r\neven the reed required considerable seasoning to render it pliable,\r\nand to be instructed, as it were, in the proper modulation of its\r\nsounds; the mouth-piece and stops[2628] being naturally contracted,\r\nand so producing a music better adapted to the theatrical taste of\r\nthe day. But in later times, when the music became more varied, and\r\nluxury began to exercise its influence upon the musical taste, it\r\nbecame the general usage to cut the reeds before the summer solstice,\r\nand to make them fit for use at the end of three months; the stops and\r\nmouth-piece being found, when the reeds were cut at that period, to be\r\nmore open and better adapted for the modifications of sound: it is in\r\nthis state that the reed is used for similar purposes at the present\r\nday. In those times it was a very general persuasion also, that every\r\npipe ought to have the tongue of its own mouth-piece cut from the same\r\nreed as itself, and that a section from the part nearest the root\r\nwas best adapted to form the left-handed flute,[2629] and from the\r\npart adjoining the top the right-handed one: those reeds, too, were\r\nconsidered immeasurably superior, which had been washed by the waters\r\nof Cephisus itself.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the sacrificial pipes used by the Tuscans are\r\nmade of box-wood, while those employed at the games are made of the\r\nlotus,[2630] the bones of the ass, or else silver. The fowler’s reeds\r\nof the best quality are those of Panormus,[2631] and the best reeds for\r\nfishing-rods come from Abarita in Africa.[2632]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 67.—THE VINE-DRESSERS’ REED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reed is employed in Italy more particularly, as a support for\r\nthe vine. Cato[2633] recommends that it should be planted in a damp\r\nsituation, the soil being first turned up with a double mattock, and a\r\ndistance of three feet left between the young[2634] layers; he says,\r\ntoo, that the wild asparagus[2635] from which the cultivated species is\r\nproduced, may be planted together with it, as they agree particularly\r\nwell together.\r\n\r\n(37.) He says also that the willow may be planted in its vicinity, than\r\nwhich there is no aquatic plant of more general utility, although the\r\npoplar may be preferred for the training of the vine, and the support\r\nof the Cæcuban grape; although, too, the alder affords a more efficient\r\nprotection by the hedges it forms, and, planted in the very water,\r\nmakes a rampart along the banks in defence of the adjoining country\r\nagainst the violence of the rivers when they overflow; when cut down,\r\ntoo, this last tree is useful for the innumerable suckers which it\r\nthrows out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 68.—- THE WILLOW: EIGHT VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the willow, too, there are several varieties. One[2636] of them\r\nthrows out its branches to a considerable height; and these, coupled\r\ntogether, serve as perches for the vine, while the bark around the\r\ntree itself is used for withes.[2637] Others,[2638] again, of a more\r\npliable nature, supply a flexible twig, which is used for the purpose\r\nof tying; while others throw out osiers of remarkable thinness, adapted\r\nby their suppleness and graceful slenderness for the manufacture of\r\nwicker-work.[2639] Others, again, of a stouter make, are used for\r\nweaving panniers, and many other utensils employed in agriculture;\r\nwhile from a whiter willow the bark is peeled off, and, being\r\nremarkably tractable, admits of various utensils being made of it,\r\nwhich require a softer and more pliable material than leather: this\r\nlast is also found particularly useful in the construction of those\r\narticles of luxury, reclining chairs. The willow, when cut, continues\r\nto thrive, and, indeed, throws out more thickly from the top, which,\r\nwhen closely clipped, bears a stronger resemblance to a closed fist\r\nthan the top of a stump. It is a tree, which, in my opinion, deserves\r\nto be placed by no means in the lowest rank of trees; for there is none\r\nthat will yield a more certain profit, which can be cultivated at less\r\nexpense, or which is less liable to be influenced by changes in the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 69.—TREES IN ADDITION TO THE WILLOW, WHICH ARE OF USE IN MAKING\r\nWITHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCato[2640] considers the culture of the willow as deserving to hold the\r\nthird rank in estimation, and he gives it precedence to the cultivation\r\nof the olive, tillage for corn, or laying out land for pasture. It is\r\nnot, however, because the willow is the only tree that produces withes;\r\nfor they may be procured also from the broom, the poplar, the elm,\r\nthe blood-red cornel, the birch, and the reed itself when split, or\r\nelse the leaves of that plant, as we know to be the case in Liguria.\r\nThe vine, also, will furnish them; the bramble, too, with the thorns\r\nremoved, as well as the twisted hazel. It is a very singular thing,\r\nthat a wood after it has been beaten and pounded should be found all\r\nthe stronger for making withes, but such is a striking peculiarity that\r\nexists in the willow. The Greek red[2641] willow is split for this\r\npurpose: while the willow[2642] of Ameria is whiter but more brittle,\r\nfor which reason it is used in an uncut state for tying. In Asia there\r\nare three varieties known of the willow; the black[2643] willow, which\r\nis best adapted for making withes, the white willow, employed for\r\nvarious agricultural purposes, and a third, which is shorter than the\r\nothers, and known as the helix.[2644]\r\n\r\nWith us, also, there is the same number of denominations given to as\r\nmany varieties of the willow; one being known as the viminal or purple\r\nwillow,[2645] another as the nitelina,[2646] from its resemblance to\r\nthe colour of the nitela, thinner in the trunk than the preceding one,\r\nand the third as the Gallic[2647] kind, being the thinnest of them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 70.—RUSHES: CANDLE-RUSHES: RUSHES FOR THATCHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rush,[2648] so frail in form, and growing in marshy spots, cannot\r\nbe reckoned as belonging to the shrubs, nor yet to the brambles or the\r\nstalk plants; nor, indeed, in strict justice, to any of the classes of\r\nplants except one that is peculiarly its own. It is extensively used\r\nfor making thatch and matting, and, with the outer coat taken off, for\r\nmaking candles and funeral torches. In some places, however, the rush\r\nis more hard and firm: thus, for instance, it is employed not only\r\nby the sailors on the Padus for making the sails of boats, but for\r\nthe purposes of sea-fishing as well, by the fishermen of Africa, who,\r\nin a most preposterous manner, hang the sails made of it behind the\r\nmasts.[2649] The people, too, of Mauritania thatch their cottages[2650]\r\nwith rushes; indeed, if we look somewhat closely into the matter, it\r\nwill appear that the rush is held in pretty nearly the same degree\r\nof estimation there as the papyrus is in the inner regions of the\r\nworld.[2651]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 71.—THE ELDER: THE BRAMBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf a peculiar nature, too, though to be reckoned among the\r\nwater[2652]-plants, is the bramble, a shrub-like plant, and the elder,\r\nwhich is of a spongy nature, though not resembling giant fennel,\r\nfrom having upon it a greater quantity of wood. It is a belief among\r\nthe shepherds that if they cut a horn or trumpet from the wood of\r\nthis tree, it will give all the louder sound if cut in a spot where\r\nthe shrub has been out of hearing of the crowing of the cock. The\r\nbramble bears mulberries,[2653] and one variety of it, known as the\r\ncynosbatos,[2654] bears a flower similar to the rose. There is a third\r\nvariety, known to the Greeks as the Idæan[2655] bramble, from the place\r\nwhere it grows: it is slighter than the others, with smaller thorns,\r\nand not so hooked. Its flower, mixed with honey, is employed as an\r\nointment for sore eyes and erysipelas: and an infusion of it in water\r\nis used for diseases of the stomach.[2656]\r\n\r\nThe elder[2657] bears a small black berry, which contains a viscous\r\njuice, employed more particularly for staining[2658] the hair. The\r\nberries, too, are boiled in water and eaten.[2659]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 72. (38.)—THE JUICES OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a juice in the bark of trees, which must be looked upon as\r\ntheir blood, though it is not of a similar nature in all. In the fig it\r\nis of a milky consistency, and has the peculiar property of curdling\r\nmilk, and so forming cheese.[2660] In the cherry-tree this juice is\r\ngummy, in the elm clammy, in the apple viscous and fatty, while in the\r\nvine and the pear it is watery. The more viscous this humour is, the\r\nmore long-lived the tree. In a word, we find in the bodies of trees—as\r\nwith all other beings that are animated—skin, blood, flesh, sinews,\r\nveins, bones, and marrow; the bark serving them in place of skin. It is\r\na singular fact connected with the mulberry-tree, that when the medical\r\nmen wish to extract its juice, if the incision is lightly made, by a\r\nblow with a stone, and at the second hour of the day in spring, the\r\njuice will flow: but if, on the other hand, a wound is inflicted to any\r\ndepth, it has all the appearance of being dried up.\r\n\r\nImmediately beneath the bark in most trees there is a fatty substance,\r\nwhich, from its colour, has obtained the name of alburnum:[2661] it is\r\nsoft, and is the very worst part of the wood, and in the robur even\r\nwill very easily rot, being particularly liable to wood-worm, for which\r\nreason it is invariably removed. Beneath this fat lies the flesh[2662]\r\nof the tree, and then under that, its bones, or, in other words, the\r\nchoicest part of the wood. Those trees which have a dry wood, the\r\nolive, for instance, bear fruit every other year only: this is more the\r\ncase with them than with those the wood of which is of a fleshy nature,\r\nsuch as the cherry, for instance. It is not all trees, too, that have\r\nthis fat and flesh in any abundance, the same as we find to be the\r\ncase among the more active animals. The box, the cornel, and the olive\r\nhave none at all, nor yet any marrow, and a very small proportion,\r\ntoo, of blood. In the same way, too, the service-tree has no bones,\r\nand the elder no flesh, while both of them have marrow in the greatest\r\nabundance. Reeds, too, have hardly any flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 73.—THE VEINS AND FIBRES OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the flesh of some trees we find both fibres[2663] and veins: they\r\nare easily distinguished. The veins[2664] are larger, while the fibres\r\nare of whiter material, and are to be found in those woods more\r\nparticularly which are easily split. Hence it is that if the ear is\r\napplied to the extremity of a beam of wood, however long, a tap with\r\na graver[2665] even upon the other end may be distinctly heard, the\r\nsound penetrating by the passages which run straight through it: by\r\nthese means it is that we ascertain whether timber runs awry, or is\r\ninterrupted by knots. The tuberosities which we find on trees resemble\r\nthe kernels[2666] that are formed in flesh: they contain neither\r\nveins nor fibres, but only a kind of tough, solid flesh, rolled up in\r\na sort of ball: it is these tuberosities that are the most esteemed\r\nparts[2667] in the citrus and the maple. As to the other kinds of wood\r\nwhich are employed for making tables, the trees are split into planks\r\nlengthwise, and the parts are then selected along which the fibres\r\nrun, and properly rounded; for the wood would be too brittle to use if\r\nit were cut in segments crosswise.[2668] In the beech, the grain of\r\nthe fibrous part runs crosswise;[2669] hence it is that the ancients\r\nheld in such high esteem all vessels made with the wood of it. Manius\r\nCurius made oath, on one occasion, that he had not touched an article\r\nof all the spoil except a single oil cruet[2670] of beech, to use for\r\nsacrificing. Wood is always put lengthwise into the water to season,\r\nas that part which was nearest the root will sink to a greater[2671]\r\ndepth than the other. In some wood there is fibre, without veins,\r\nand merely consisting of filaments slightly knit together: wood of\r\nthis nature is remarkably fissile. Other wood, again, is more easily\r\nbroken across than split, such as the wood of those trees that have no\r\nfibre, the olive and the vine, for instance: on the other hand, in the\r\nfig-tree, the whole of the body consists of flesh.[2672] The holm-oak,\r\nthe cornel, the robur, the cytisus, the mulberry, the ebony, the lotus,\r\nand the other trees which we have mentioned[2673] as being destitute\r\nof marrow, consist entirely of bone.[2674] All these woods are of a\r\nblackish colour, with the exception of the cornel, of which glossy\r\nyellow hunting-spears are made, marked with incisions for their further\r\nembellishment. In the cedar, the juniper, and the larch, the wood is\r\nred.\r\n\r\n(39.) In Greece the female larch furnishes a wood[2675] which is known\r\nas ægis, and is just the colour of honey. This wood has been found to\r\nbe proof against decay, and forms the pannels used by painters, being\r\nnever known to gape or split; the portion thus employed is that which\r\nlies nearest to the pith. In the fir-tree this part is called “leuson”\r\nby the Greeks. In the cedar, too, the hardest part is the wood that\r\nlies nearest to the sap: after the slimy[2676] pith has been carefully\r\nremoved, it has a similar degree of hardness to the bones in the bodies\r\nof animals. It is said, too, that in Greece the inner part of the elder\r\nis remarkably firm: indeed, those whose business it is to make hunting\r\nspears, prefer this material to all others, it being a wood composed\r\nwholly of skin and bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 74.—THE FELLING OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper time for felling trees that are wanted for barking, the\r\nround, tapering trees, for instance, that are employed in temples and\r\nfor other purposes, is at the period of germination:[2677] for at\r\nother times it is quite impossible to detach the bark from the rotten\r\nwood that adheres to it, while the wood itself assumes a blackish\r\nhue. Squared logs, and wood from which the bark has been lopped, are\r\ngenerally cut in the period that intervenes between the winter solstice\r\nand the prevalence of the west winds; or else, if it is necessary to\r\nanticipate that period, at the setting of Arcturus and before that of\r\nthe Lyre, the very earliest period being the summer solstice: the days\r\nof these respective constellations will be mentioned in the appropriate\r\nplace.[2678]\r\n\r\nIn general it is looked upon as quite sufficient to use all due\r\nprecaution that a tree is not rough-hewn before it has borne its\r\nyearly crop. The robur, if cut in spring, is subject to the attacks\r\nof wood-worm, but if cut in winter, will neither rot nor warp:\r\notherwise it is very liable to bend and become awry, as well as to\r\ncrack; the same is the case, too, with the cork-tree, even if cut\r\ndown at the proper time. The state of the moon,[2679] too, is of\r\ninfinite importance, and it is generally recommended that trees\r\nshould be cut only between the twentieth and the thirtieth days of\r\nthe month. It is generally agreed, however, by all, that it is the\r\nvery best time for felling timber, when the moon is in conjunction\r\nwith the sun, a day which is called by some persons the interlunium,\r\nand by others the moon’s silence. At all events, it was under these\r\ncircumstances that Tiberius Cæsar gave orders for the larches to be\r\ncut in Rhætia, that were required for the purpose of rebuilding the\r\nbridge of the Naumachia[2680] after it had been destroyed by fire.\r\nSome persons say that the moon ought not only to be in conjunction,\r\nbut below the horizon as well, a thing that can only happen in the\r\nnight. If the conjunction should chance to fall on the very day of the\r\nwinter solstice, the timber, they say, that is then felled will be of\r\neverlasting duration; the next best being the timber that is cut when\r\nthe conjunction coincides with the constellations previously mentioned.\r\nThere are some, too, who add the rising of the Dog-star as a favourable\r\ntime, and say that it was at this period that the timber was cut which\r\nwas employed in building the Forum of Augustus.\r\n\r\nWood which is intended for timber ought to be cut neither when too\r\nyoung nor too old. Some persons, too—and the practice is by no means\r\nwithout its utility—cut round[2681] the tree as far as the pith, and\r\nthen leave the timber standing, so that all the juices may be enabled\r\nto escape. Going back to ancient times, it is a remarkable fact, that\r\nin the first Punic War the fleet commanded by Duillius was on the water\r\nwithin sixty days from the time the timber was cut: and, what is still\r\nmore so, Piso relates that King Hiero had two hundred and twenty ships\r\nwholly constructed in forty-five days: in the second Punic War, too,\r\nthe fleet of Scipio was at sea the fortieth day after the axe had been\r\nput to the tree. Such is the energy and dispatch that can be displayed\r\non occasions of emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 75.—THE OPINION OF CATO ON THE FELLING OF TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCato,[2682] a man of consummate authority in all practical matters,\r\nexpresses himself in relation to timber to the following effect:—“For\r\nmaking presses, employ the wood of the sappinus in preference. When\r\nyou root up the elm, the pine, the nut-tree, or, indeed, any other\r\nkind of tree, mind and do so when the moon is on the wane, after\r\nmidday, and when there is no south wind blowing. The proper time for\r\ncutting a tree is when the seed[2683] is ripe, but be careful not to\r\ndraw it away or plane it while the dew is falling.” He then proceeds\r\nto say[2684]—“Never touch the timber, except when the moon is on the\r\nchange, or else at the end of the second quarter: at those periods you\r\nmay either root up the tree, or fell it as it stands. The next seven\r\ndays after the full moon are the best of all for grubbing up a tree. Be\r\nparticularly careful, too, not to rough-hew timber, or, indeed, to cut\r\nor touch it, unless it is perfectly dry; and by no means while it is\r\ncovered with frost or dew.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Tiberius used also to observe the changes of the moon for\r\ncutting his hair.[2685] M. Varro[2686] has recommended that the hair\r\nshould be cut at full moon only, if we would avoid baldness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 76.—THE SIZE OF TREES: THE NATURE OF WOOD: THE SAPPINUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the larch, and still more the fir, after it has been cut, a\r\nliquid[2687] flows for a considerable period: these are the loftiest\r\nand straightest of all the trees. The fir is preferred for making the\r\nmasts and sailyards of ships, on account of its comparative lightness.\r\nIt is a common feature with these trees, in common with the pine,\r\nto have four rows of veins running along the wood, or else two, or\r\nsometimes only one. The heart[2688] of these trees is peculiarly well\r\nadapted for joiners’ work, and the best wood of all is that which has\r\nfour layers of veins, it being softer than the rest: men of experience\r\nin these matters can instantly form a judgment of the quality from\r\nthe bark. That part in the fir which is nearest to the ground is free\r\nfrom knots: when soaked in river water in the way we have already\r\nmentioned,[2689] and then barked, the wood of this part is known[2690]\r\nas sappinus; while that of the upper part, which is harder and knotty,\r\ngoes by the name of “fusterna.” In trees, the side which looks towards\r\nthe north-east is the most robust, and it is universally the case, that\r\nthose which grow in moist and damp localities are of inferior quality,\r\nwhile in those which grow in warm and sunny spots, the wood is more\r\ncompact and durable; hence it is, that at Rome the fir is preferred\r\nthat grows on the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea to that of the shores of\r\nthe Adriatic.\r\n\r\nThere are also considerable differences in the qualities of these trees\r\naccording to the country of their growth: the most esteemed are those\r\nof the Alps and the Apennines; in Gaul, those of Jura[2691] and Mount\r\nVogesus; those also of Corsica, Bithynia, Pontus, and Macedonia; while\r\nthe firs of Ænea[2692] and Arcadia are of inferior quality. Those,\r\nhowever, of Parnassus and Eubœa are the worst of all, the trees being\r\nbranchy and knotted, and the wood very apt to rot. As for the cedar,\r\nthose of Crete, Africa, and Syria are the most esteemed. Wood, if well\r\nrubbed with oil of cedar, is proof against wood-worm and decay. The\r\njuniper, too, has the same[2693] virtues as the cedar; in Spain it\r\ngrows to a very considerable size, in the territory of the Vaccæi[2694]\r\nmore particularly: the heart of this tree, too, is universally more\r\nfirm and solid than cedar even. A general fault in all wood is that\r\nknown as cross-grain, which is formed by contortions of the knots\r\nand veins.[2695] In the wood of some trees there are to be found\r\nknurs,[2696] like those in marble; these knurs are remarkably hard, and\r\noffer a resistance like that of a nail, to the great injury of the saw:\r\nin some cases, also, they are formed accidentally, from either a stone,\r\nor the branch of another tree lodging there, and being absorbed in the\r\nbody of the tree.\r\n\r\nIn the Forum at Megara there long stood a wild olive upon which\r\nwarriors who had distinguished themselves by their martial powers\r\nhad been in the habit of suspending their arms. In the lapse of time\r\nthe bark of this tree had closed, and quite concealed these arms from\r\nview. Upon it, however, depended the fate of the city; for it had been\r\nannounced by an oracle, that when a tree there should bring forth arms,\r\nthe fall of the city would be close at hand: and such, in fact, was\r\nthe result, when the tree was cut down and greaves and helmets were\r\nfound within the wood.[2697] It is said that stones found under these\r\ncircumstances have the property of preventing abortion.\r\n\r\n(40.) It is generally thought that the largest[2698] tree that has ever\r\nbeen seen, was the one that was exhibited at Rome, by Tiberius Cæsar,\r\nas an object of curiosity, upon the bridge of the Naumachia previously\r\nmentioned.[2699] It had been brought thither along with other timber,\r\nand was preserved till the construction of the amphitheatre of the\r\nEmperor Nero:[2700] it was a log of larch, one hundred and twenty feet\r\nlong, and of an uniform thickness of a couple of feet. From this fact\r\nwe can form an estimate of the original height of the tree; indeed,\r\nmeasured from top to bottom it must have been originally of a length\r\nthat is almost incredible. In our own time, too, in the porticos of the\r\nSepta,[2701] there was a log which had been left there by M. Agrippa,\r\nas being equally an object of curiosity, having been found too large to\r\nbe used in the building of the vote office[2702] there: it was twenty\r\nfeet shorter than the one previously mentioned, and a foot-and-a-half\r\nin thickness. There was a fir, too, that was particularly admired, when\r\nit formed the mast of the ship, which brought from Egypt, by order of\r\nthe Emperor Caius,[2703] the obelisk[2704] that was erected in the\r\nVaticanian Circus, with the four blocks of stone intended for its base.\r\nIt is beyond all doubt that there has been seen nothing on the sea\r\nmore wonderful than this ship: one hundred and twenty thousand modii\r\nof lentils formed its ballast; and the length of it took up the greater\r\npart of the left side of the harbour at Ostia. It was sunk at that spot\r\nby order of the Emperor Claudius, three moles, each as high as a tower,\r\nbeing built upon it; they were constructed with cement[2705] which the\r\nsame vessel had conveyed from Puteoli. It took the arms of four men\r\nto span the girth of this tree, and we not unfrequently hear of the\r\nprice of masts for such purposes, as being eighty thousand sesterces or\r\nmore: rafts, too, of this wood are sometimes put together, the value\r\nof which is forty thousand. In Egypt and Syria, it is said, the kings,\r\nfor want of fir, used to employ cedar[2706] for building their ships:\r\nthe largest cedar that we find mentioned is said to have come from\r\nCyprus, where it was cut to form the mast of a galley of eleven tiers\r\nof oars that belonged to Demetrius: it was one hundred and thirty feet\r\nin length, and took three men to span its girth. The pirates of Germany\r\nnavigate their seas in vessels formed of a single tree hollowed[2707]\r\nout: some of these will hold as many as thirty men.\r\n\r\nOf all woods, the most compact, and consequently the heaviest, are the\r\nebony and the box, both of them of a slender make. Neither of these\r\nwoods will float in water, nor, indeed, will that of the cork tree,\r\nif the bark is removed; the same is the case, too, with the wood of\r\nthe larch. Of the other woods, the driest is that of the tree known at\r\nRome as the lotus,[2708] and next, that of the robur, when the white\r\nsap has been removed. The wood of the robur is dark, and that of the\r\ncytisus[2709] still more so, approaching, in fact, the nearest of all\r\nto the colour of ebony; though there are not wanting writers who assert\r\nthat the wood of the Syrian terebinth is darker.[2710] An artist of the\r\nname of Thericles is highly spoken of for his skill in turning goblets\r\nfrom the wood of the terebinth: and, indeed, that fact is a proof of\r\nthe goodness of the wood. Terebinth is the only wood that requires to\r\nbe rubbed with oil, and is improved thereby. Its colour is imitated\r\nremarkably well with the walnut and the wild pear, which have its\r\npeculiar tint imparted to them by being boiled in colouring liquid.\r\nThe wood of all the trees of which we have here made mention is firm\r\nand compact. Next after them comes the cornel, although it can hardly\r\nbe looked upon as timber, in consequence of its remarkable slimness;\r\nthe wood of it, in fact, is used for hardly any other purpose than the\r\nspokes of wheels, or else for making wedges for splitting wood, and\r\npins or bolts, which have all the hardness of those of iron. Besides\r\nthese, there are the holm-oak, the wild and the cultivated olive, the\r\nchesnut, the yoke-elm, and the poplar. This last is mottled similarly\r\nto the maple, and would be used for joiners’ work if wood could be good\r\nfor anything when the branches are so often lopped: that acting upon\r\nthe tree as a sort of castration, and depriving it of its strength.\r\nIn addition to these facts, most of these trees, but the robur more\r\nparticularly, are so extremely hard, that it is quite impossible to\r\nbore the wood till it has been soaked in water; and even then, a nail\r\nonce driven home cannot be drawn out again. On the other hand, a nail\r\nhas no[2711] hold in cedar. The wood of the lime is the softest of all,\r\nand, as it would appear, the hottest by nature; a proof of this, they\r\nsay, is the fact that it will turn the edge of the adze sooner than any\r\nother wood.[2712] In the number, also, of the trees that are hot by\r\nnature, are the mulberry, the laurel, the ivy, and all those woods from\r\nwhich fire is kindled by attrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 77.—METHODS OF OBTAINING FIRE FROM WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a method[2713] which has been employed by the outposts of\r\narmies, and by shepherds, on occasions when there has not been a stone\r\nat hand to strike fire with. Two pieces of wood are rubbed briskly\r\ntogether, and the friction soon sets them on fire; which is caught on\r\ndry and inflammable substances, funguses and leaves being found to\r\nignite the most readily. There is nothing superior to the wood of the\r\nivy for rubbing against, or to that of the laurel for rubbing with.\r\nA species of wild vine,[2714] too—not the same as the labrusca—which\r\nclimbs up other trees like the ivy, is highly approved of. The\r\ncoldest[2715] woods of all are those of the aquatic trees; but they are\r\nthe most flexible also, and for that reason the best adapted for the\r\nconstruction of bucklers. On an incision being made in them, they will\r\ncontract immediately, and so close up their wounds, at the same time\r\nrendering it more difficult for the iron to penetrate: in the number of\r\nthese woods are the fig, the willow, the lime, the birch, the elder,\r\nand both varieties of the poplar.\r\n\r\nThe lightest of all these woods, and consequently the most useful, are\r\nthe fig and the willow. They are all of them employed, however, in the\r\nmanufacture of baskets and other utensils of wicker-work; while, at\r\nthe same time, they possess a degree of whiteness and hardness which\r\nrender them very well adapted for carving. The plane has considerable\r\nflexibility, but it is moist and slimy like the alder. The elm, too,\r\nthe ash, the mulberry, and the cherry, are flexible, but of a drier\r\nnature; the wood, however, is more weighty. The elm is the best of all\r\nfor retaining its natural toughness, and hence it is more particularly\r\nemployed for socket beams for hinges, and cases for the pannelling of\r\ndoors, being proof against warping. It is requisite, however, that the\r\nbeam to receive the hinge should be inverted when set up, the top of\r\nthe tree answering to the lower hinge, the root to the upper. The wood\r\nof the palm and the cork-tree is soft, while that of the apple and the\r\npear is compact. Such, however, is not the case with the maple, its\r\nwood being brittle, as, in fact, all veined woods are. In every kind\r\nof tree, the varieties in the wood are still more augmented by the\r\nwild trees and the males. The wood, too, of the barren tree is more\r\nsolid than that of the fruit-bearing ones, except in those species in\r\nwhich the male trees[2716] bear fruit, the cypress and the cornel, for\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 78.—TREES WHICH ARE PROOF AGAINST DECAY: TREES WHICH NEVER SPLIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following trees are proof against decay and the otherwise\r\ninjurious effects of age—the cypress, the cedar, the ebony, the lotus,\r\nthe box, the yew, the juniper, and both the wild and cultivated olive.\r\nAmong the others, the larch, the robur, the cork-tree, the chesnut, and\r\nthe walnut are also remarkably durable. The cedar, cypress, olive, and\r\nbox are never known to split or crack spontaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 79.—HISTORICAL FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE DURABILITY OF WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the woods, the ebony, the cypress, and the cedar are considered\r\nto be the most durable, a good proof of which is to be seen in the\r\ntimber of which the Temple of Diana at Ephesus is built: it being now\r\nfour hundred years since it was erected, at the joint expense of the\r\nwhole of Asia;[2717] and, what is a well-known fact, the roof is wholly\r\nconstructed of planks of cedar. As to the statue of the goddess, there\r\nis some doubt of what wood it is made; all the writers say that it is\r\nebony, with the exception of Mucianus, who was three times consul, one\r\nof the very latest among the writers that have seen it; he declares\r\nthat it is made of the wood of the vine, and that it has never been\r\nchanged all the seven times that the temple has been rebuilt. He says,\r\ntoo, that it was Endæus who made choice of this wood, and even goes\r\nso far as to mention the artist’s name, a thing that really surprises\r\nme very much, seeing that he attributes to it an antiquity that dates\r\nbefore the times of Father Liber, and of Minerva even. He states, also,\r\nthat, by the aid of numerous apertures, it is soaked with nard, in\r\norder that the moist nature of that drug may preserve the wood and keep\r\nthe seams[2718] close together: I am rather surprised, however, that\r\nthere should be any seams in the statue, considering the very moderate\r\nsize it is. He informs us, also, that the doors are made of cypress,\r\nand that the wood, which has now lasted very nearly four hundred years,\r\nhas all the appearance of new.[2719] It is worthy of remark, too, that\r\nthe wood of these doors, after the pieces had been glued together, was\r\nleft to season four years before they were put up: cypress was made\r\nchoice of from the circumstance that it is the only kind of wood that\r\nmaintains its polish to all future time.\r\n\r\nAnd have we not the statue of Vejovis,[2720] also, made of cypress,\r\nstill preserved in the Capitol, where it was consecrated in the year\r\nof the City 661? The Temple of Apollo, too, at Utica, is equally\r\ncelebrated: there we may see beams of cedar still in existence, and in\r\njust the same condition in which they were when erected at the first\r\nbuilding of that city, eleven hundred and seventy-eight years ago. At\r\nSaguntum, too, in Spain, there is a temple of Diana, which was brought\r\nthither by the original founders of the place, from the island of\r\nZacynthus, in the year 200 before the taking of Troy, Bocchus says—It\r\nis preserved beneath the town, they say. Hannibal, being induced\r\nthereto by feelings of religious veneration, spared this temple, and\r\nits beams, made of juniper, are still in existence at this very day.\r\nBut the most memorable instance of all is that of the temple which\r\nwas dedicated to the same goddess at Aulis, several ages before the\r\nTrojan War: of what wood, however, it was originally built is a fact\r\nthat has been long lost in oblivion. Speaking in general terms, we may\r\nsay that those woods are of the greatest durability which are the most\r\nodoriferous.[2721]\r\n\r\nNext to those woods of which we have just spoken, that of the mulberry\r\nis held in the highest degree of esteem, and it will even turn black\r\nwhen old. There are some trees, again, that are more durable than\r\nothers, when employed for certain purposes. The wood of the elm lasts\r\nthe best in the open air, that of the robur when buried in the ground,\r\nand that of the quercus when exposed to the action of water: indeed,\r\nthe wood of this last, if employed in works above ground, is apt to\r\nsplit and warp. The wood of the larch thrives best in the midst of\r\nmoisture; the same is the case, too, with that of the black alder. The\r\nwood of the robur spoils by exposure to the action of sea-water. The\r\nbeech and the walnut are far from disapproved of for constructions\r\nunder water, and, in fact, these are the principal woods, too, that\r\nare used for works under ground: the same is the case, also, with the\r\njuniper; which is equally serviceable when exposed to the atmosphere.\r\nThe woods of the beech and the cerrus[2722] very quickly deteriorate,\r\nand that of the æsculus will not withstand the action of water. On\r\nthe other hand, the alder, when driven into the ground in marshy\r\nlocalities, is of everlasting duration, and able to support the very\r\nheaviest weights. The wood of the cherry is strong, while those of\r\nthe elm and the ash are pliable, though apt to warp: these last will\r\nstill retain their flexibility, and be less liable to warp, if the wood\r\nis left to stand and dry upon the trunk after the pith has been cut\r\naround.[2723] It is said that the larch, when used for sea-going ships,\r\nis liable to the attacks[2724] of the teredo, as, in fact, all the\r\nwoods are, with the exception of the wild and cultivated olive. It is a\r\nfact, too, that there are some woods that are more liable to spoil in\r\nthe sea, and others in the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 80. (41.)—VARIETIES OF THE TEREDO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are four kinds of insects that attack wood. The teredo has a\r\nhead remarkably large in proportion to the other part of the body, and\r\ngnaws away the wood with its teeth: its attacks, however, are confined\r\nsolely to the sea, and it is generally thought that this is the only\r\ninsect that is properly so called. The wood-worm that prevails on the\r\nland is known as the “tinea,” while those which resemble a gnat in\r\nappearance are called “thripes.” The fourth kind of wood-worm belongs\r\nto the maggot class; some of them being engendered by the corruption\r\nof the juices of the wood itself, and others being produced, just\r\nas in the trees, by the worm known as the cerastes.[2725] When this\r\nworm has eaten away enough of the wood to enable it to turn round, it\r\ngives birth to another. The generation of these insects is prevented,\r\nhowever, by the bitterness that exists in some woods, the cypress, and\r\nthe hardness of others, the box, for instance.\r\n\r\nIt is said, too, that the fir, if barked about the time of budding, and\r\nat the period of the moon already mentioned,[2726] will never spoil in\r\nwater. The followers of Alexander the Great have left a statement that,\r\nat Tylos, an island in the Red Sea, there are trees, of which ships\r\nare built, the wood of which has been found uninjured at the end of two\r\nhundred years,[2727] even if it has been under water all that time.\r\nThey say, also, that in the same island there is a certain shrub,[2728]\r\nabout the thickness of a walking-stick only, and spotted like a tiger’s\r\nskin: it is very heavy, and will break like glass if it happens to fall\r\nupon a hard substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 81. (42.)—THE WOODS USED IN BUILDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have in Italy some woods that are apt to split of themselves: to\r\nprevent this, architects recommend that they should be first seasoned\r\nin manure[2729] and then dried, in order to render them proof against\r\nthe action of the atmosphere. The woods of the fir and larch are well\r\nadapted, even when used transversely, for the support of heavy burdens;\r\nwhile the robur and the olive are apt to bend and give way under a\r\nweight. The wood of the poplar and the palm are also strong, but this\r\nlast will bend, though in a manner different from the others; for,\r\nwhile in all other instances the wood bends downwards, in the palm it\r\nbends in the contrary direction,[2730] and forms an arch. The woods\r\nof the pine and the cypress are proof against decay and all attacks\r\nof wood-worm. The walnut is easily warped, but we sometimes see beams\r\neven made of it. It gives warning, however, before it breaks, by a loud\r\ncracking noise; such was the case at Antandros, at the public baths\r\nthere—the bathers took the alarm upon hearing the beams crack, and made\r\ntheir escape. The pine, the pitch-tree, and the alder are employed for\r\nmaking hollow pipes for the conveyance of water, and when buried in the\r\nearth will last for many years. If, however, they are not well covered\r\nover, they will very soon rot; and the resistance they offer to decay\r\nwill increase in a most surprising degree if the outer surface as well\r\nis left in contact with the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 82.—CARPENTERS’ WOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wood of the fir is strongest in a vertical[2731] position: it is\r\nremarkably well adapted for the pannels of doors, and all kinds of\r\nin-door joiners’ work, whether in the Grecian, the Campanian, or the\r\nSicilian style. The shavings of this wood when briskly planed, always\r\ncurl up in circles like the tendrils of the vine. This wood, too,\r\nunites particularly well with glue: it is used in this state for making\r\nvehicles, and is found to split sooner in the solid parts than in a\r\nplace where the pieces have been glued together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 83. (43.)—WOODS UNITED WITH GLUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlue, too, plays one of the principal parts in all veneering and works\r\nof marqueterie. For this purpose, the workmen usually employ wood\r\nwith a threaded vein, to which they give the name of “ferulea,” from\r\nits resemblance to the grain of the giant fennel,[2732] this part of\r\nthe wood being preferred from its being dotted and wavy. In every\r\nvariety there are some woods to be found that will not take the glue,\r\nand which refuse to unite either with wood of the same kind or of any\r\nother; the wood of the robur for example. Indeed, it is mostly the case\r\nthat substances will not unite unless they are of a similar nature; a\r\nstone, for instance, cannot be made to adhere to wood. The wood of the\r\nservice-tree, the yoke-elm, the box, and, in a less degree, the lime,\r\nhave a particular aversion to uniting with the cornel. All the yielding\r\nwoods which we have already spoken[2733] of as flexible readily adapt\r\nthemselves to every kind of work; and in addition to them, the mulberry\r\nand the wild fig. Those which are moderately moist are easily sawn\r\nand cut, but dry woods are apt to give way beyond the part that is\r\ntouched by the saw; while, on the other hand, the green woods, with the\r\nexception of the robur and the box, offer a more obstinate resistance,\r\nfilling the intervals between the teeth of the saw with sawdust, and\r\nrendering its edge uniform and inert; it is for this reason that the\r\nteeth are often made to project right and left in turns, a method by\r\nwhich the saw-dust is discharged. The ash is found the most pliable\r\nwood of all for working; and, indeed, for making[2734] spears it is\r\nbetter even than the hazel, being lighter than the cornel, and more\r\npliable than the wood of the service-tree. The Gallic variety is so\r\nsupple, that it is employed in the construction of vehicles even. The\r\nelm would rival the trunk of the vine[2735] for some purposes, were it\r\nnot that its weight is so much against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 84.—VENEERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wood, too, of the beech is easily worked, although it is brittle\r\nand soft. Cut into thin layers of veneer, it is very flexible, but is\r\nonly used for the construction of boxes and desks. The wood, too, of\r\nthe holm-oak is cut into veneers of remarkable thinness, the colour\r\nof which is far from unsightly; but it is more particularly where it\r\nis exposed to friction that this wood is valued, as being one to be\r\ndepended upon; in the axle-trees of wheels, for instance; for which the\r\nash is also employed, on account of its pliancy, the holm-oak for its\r\nhardness, and the elm, for the union in it of both those qualities.\r\nThere are also various workman’s tools made of wood, which, though\r\nbut small, are still remarkably useful; in this respect, it is said\r\nthat the best materials for making auger handles are the wild olive,\r\nthe box, the holm-oak, the elm, and the ash. Of the same woods also\r\nmallets are made; the larger ones, however, are made of the pine and\r\nthe holm-oak. These woods, too, have a greater degree of strength\r\nand hardness if cut in season than when hewn prematurely; indeed, it\r\nhas been known for hinge-jambs, made of olive, a wood of remarkable\r\nhardness, after having remained a considerable time on the spot, to\r\nput out buds[2736] like a growing plant. Cato[2737] recommends levers\r\nto be made of holly, laurel, or elm; and Hyginus speaks highly of the\r\nyoke-elm, the holm-oak, and the cerrus, for the handles of agricultural\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nThe best woods for cutting into layers, and employing as a veneer for\r\ncovering others, are the citrus, the terebinth, the different varieties\r\nof the maple, the box, the palm,[2738] the holly, the holm-oak, the\r\nroot of the elder, and the poplar. The alder furnishes also, as already\r\nstated,[2739] a kind of tuberosity, which is cut into layers like those\r\nof the citrus and the maple. In all the other trees the tuberosities\r\nare of no value whatever. It is the central part of trees that is most\r\nvariegated, and the nearer we approach to the root the smaller are the\r\nspots and the more wavy. It was in this appearance that originated that\r\nrequirement of luxury which displays itself in covering one tree with\r\nanother, and bestowing upon the more common woods a bark of higher\r\nprice. In order to make a single tree sell many times over, laminæ\r\nof veneer have been devised; but that was not thought sufficient—the\r\nhorns of animals must next be stained of different colours, and their\r\nteeth cut into sections, in order to decorate wood with ivory, and, at\r\na later period, to veneer it all over. Then, after all this, man must\r\ngo and seek his materials in the sea as well! For this purpose he has\r\nlearned to cut tortoise-shell into sections; and of late, in the reign\r\nof Nero, there was a monstrous invention devised of destroying its\r\nnatural appearance by paint, and making it sell at a still higher price\r\nby a successful imitation of wood.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way that the value of our couches is so greatly enhanced;\r\nit is in this way, too, that they bid the rich lustre of the terebinth\r\nto be outdone, a mock citrus to be made that shall be more valuable\r\nthan the real one, and the grain of the maple to be feigned. At one\r\ntime luxury was not content with wood; at the present day it sets us on\r\nbuying tortoise-shell in the guise of wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 85. (44.)—THE AGE OF TREES. A TREE THAT WAS PLANTED BY THE FIRST\r\nSCIPIO AFRICANUS. A TREE AT ROME FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of some trees might really be looked upon as of infinite[2740]\r\nduration, if we only think of the dense wilds and inaccessible forests\r\nin some parts of the world. In relation, however, to those, the date\r\nof which is still within the memory of man, there are some olive-trees\r\nstill in existence at Liternum, which were planted by the hand of the\r\nfirst Scipio Africanus, as also a myrtle there of extraordinary size;\r\nbeneath them there is a grotto, in which, it is said, a dragon keeps\r\nwatch over that hero’s shade. There is a lotus[2741] tree in the open\r\nspace before the Temple of Lucina at Rome, which was built in the year\r\nof the City 379, a year in which the republic had no[2742] magistrates.\r\nHow much older the tree is than the temple, is a matter of doubt; but\r\nthat it is older is quite certain, for it was from that same grove that\r\nthe goddess Lucina[2743] derived her name; the tree in question is now\r\nabout four hundred and fifty years old. The lotus tree, which is known\r\nas the Capillata, is still older than this, though it is uncertain what\r\nis its age; it received that name from the circumstance of the Vestal\r\nVirgins suspending locks of their hair[2744] from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 86.—TREES AS OLD AS THE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another lotus in the Vulcanal,[2745] which Romulus erected\r\nwith the tenth part of the spoil taken from the enemy: according to\r\nMassurius, it is generally considered to be as old as the City. The\r\nroots of this tree penetrate as far as the Forum of Cæsar, right across\r\nthe meeting-places of the municipalities.[2746] There was a cypress of\r\nequal age growing with it till towards the latter part of Nero’s reign,\r\nwhen it fell to the ground, and no attempts were made to raise it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 87.—TREES IN THE SUBURBAN DISTRICTS OLDER THAN THE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill older than the City is the holm-oak that stands on the Vaticanian\r\nHill: there is an inscription in bronze upon it, written in Etruscan\r\ncharacters, which states that even in those days it was an object of\r\nreligious veneration. The foundation of the town of Tibur, too, dates\r\nmany years before that of the City of Rome: there are three holm-oaks\r\nthere, said to be more ancient than Tiburnus even, who was the\r\nfounder of that place; the tradition is that in their vicinity he was\r\ninaugurated. Tradition states also that he was a son of Amphiaraüs, who\r\ndied before Thebes, one generation before the period of the Trojan war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 88.—TREES PLANTED BY AGAMEMNON THE FIRST YEAR OF THE TROJAN WAR:\r\nOTHER TREES WHICH DATE FROM THE TIME THAT THE PLACE WAS CALLED ILIUM,\r\nANTERIOR TO THE TROJAN WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some authors, too, who state that a plane-tree at Delphi was\r\nplanted by the hand of Agamemnon, as also another at Caphyæ, a sacred\r\ngrove in Arcadia. At the present day, facing the city of Ilium, and\r\nclose to the Hellespont, there are trees growing over the tomb[2747]\r\nof Protesilaüs there, which, in all ages since that period, as soon as\r\nthey have grown of sufficient height to behold Ilium, have withered\r\naway, and then begun to flourish again. Near the city, at the tomb of\r\nIlus, there are some oaks[2748] which are said to have been planted\r\nthere when the place was first known by the name of Ilium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 89.—TREES PLANTED AT ARGOS BY HERCULES: OTHERS PLANTED BY APOLLO.\r\nA TREE MORE ANCIENT THAN ATHENS ITSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Argos[2749] an olive-tree is said to be still in existence, to\r\nwhich Argus fastened Io, after she had been changed into a cow. In the\r\nvicinity of Heraclea in Pontus, there are certain altars called after\r\nJupiter surnamed Stratios; two oaks there were planted by Hercules. In\r\nthe same country, too, is the port of Amycus,[2750] rendered famous by\r\nthe circumstance that King Bebryx was slain there. Since the day of\r\nhis death his tomb has been covered by a laurel, which has obtained\r\nthe name of the “frantic laurel,” from the fact that if a portion of\r\nit is plucked and taken on board ship, discord and quarrelling are\r\nthe inevitable result, until it has been thrown overboard. We have\r\nalready made mention[2751] of Aulocrene, a district through which you\r\npass in going from Apamia into Phrygia: at this place they show a\r\nplane upon which Marsyas was hanged, after he had been conquered by\r\nApollo, it having been chosen even in those days for its remarkable\r\nheight. At Delos, also, there is a palm[2752] to be seen which dates\r\nfrom the birth of that divinity, and at Olympia there is a wild olive,\r\nfrom which Hercules received his first wreath: at the present day it\r\nis preserved with the most scrupulous veneration. At Athens, too, the\r\nolive produced by Minerva, is said still to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 90.—TREES WHICH ARE THE MOST SHORT-LIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the pomegranate,[2753] the fig, and the apple are\r\nremarkably short-lived; the precocious trees being still more so than\r\nthe later ripeners, and those with sweet fruit than those with sour:\r\namong the pomegranates, too, that variety which bears the sweetest\r\nfruit lives the shortest time. The same is the case, too, with the\r\nvine,[2754] and more particularly the more fruitful varieties. Græcinus\r\ninforms us that vines have lasted so long as sixty years. It appears,\r\nalso, that the aquatic trees die the soonest. The laurel,[2755] the\r\napple, and the pomegranate age rapidly, it is true, but then they throw\r\nout fresh shoots at the root. The olive must be looked upon, then, as\r\nbeing one of the most long-lived, for it is generally agreed among\r\nauthors that it will last two hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 91.—TREES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED FAMOUS BY REMARKABLE EVENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the territory about the suburbs of Tusculum, upon a hill known by\r\nthe name of Corne, there is a grove which has been consecrated to Diana\r\nby the people of Latium from time immemorial; it is formed of beeches,\r\nthe foliage of which has all the appearance of being trimmed by art.\r\nPassienus Crispus, the orator, who in our time was twice consul, and\r\nafterwards became still more famous as having Nero for his step-son, on\r\nmarrying his mother Agrippina, was passionately attached to a fine tree\r\nthat grew in this grove, and would often kiss and embrace it: not only\r\nwould he lie down, too, beneath it, but he would also moisten its roots\r\nwith wine.[2756] In the vicinity of this grove there is a holm-oak,\r\nlikewise of very considerable celebrity, the trunk of which is no\r\nless[2757] than thirty-four feet in circumference; giving birth to ten\r\nother trees of remarkable size, it forms of itself a whole forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 92.—PLANTS THAT HAVE NO PECULIAR SPOT FOR THEIR GROWTH: OTHERS\r\nTHAT GROW UPON TREES, AND WILL NOT GROW IN THE GROUND. NINE VARIETIES\r\nOF THEM: CADYTAS, POLYPODION, PHAULIAS, HIPPOPHÆSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that trees are killed by ivy.[2758] The\r\nmistletoe also has a similar influence, although it is generally\r\nthought that its injurious effects are not so soon perceptible: and,\r\nindeed, this plant, apart from the fruit that it bears, is looked\r\nupon as by no means the least remarkable. There are certain vegetable\r\nproductions which cannot be propagated in the ground, and which grow\r\nnowhere but on trees; having no domicile of their own, they live upon\r\nothers; such, for instance, is the case with the mistletoe, and a herb\r\nthat grows in Syria, and is known as the “cadytas.”[2759] This last\r\nentwines around not only trees, but brambles even; in the neighbourhood\r\nof Tempe, too, in Thessaly, there is found a plant which is called\r\n“polypodion;”[2760] the dolichos[2761] is found also, and wild\r\nthyme.[2762] After the wild olive has been pruned there springs up a\r\nplant that is known as “phaulias;”[2763] while one that grows upon the\r\nfuller’s thistle is called the “hippophæston;”[2764] it has a thin,\r\nhollow stem, a small leaf, and a white root, the juice of which is\r\nconsidered extremely beneficial as a purgative in epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 93.—THREE VARIETIES OF MISTLETOE. THE NATURE OF MISTLETOE AND\r\nSIMILAR PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three varieties of the mistletoe.[2765] That which grows upon\r\nthe fir and the larch has the name of[2766] stelis in Eubœa; and there\r\nis the hyphear[2767] of Arcadia. It grows also upon the quercus,[2768]\r\nthe robur, the holm-oak, the wild plum, and the terebinth, but upon no\r\nother tree.[2769] It is most plentiful of all upon the quercus, and is\r\nthen known as “adasphear.” In all the trees, with the exception of the\r\nholm-oak and the quercus, there is a considerable difference in its\r\nsmell and pungency, and the leaf of one kind has a disagreeable odour;\r\nboth varieties, however, are sticky and bitter. The hyphear is the\r\nbest for fattening[2770] cattle with; it begins, however, by purging\r\noff all defects, after which it fattens all such animals as have been\r\nable to withstand the purging. It is generally said, however, that\r\nthose animals which have any radical malady in the intestines cannot\r\nwithstand its drastic effects. This method of treatment is generally\r\nadopted in the summer for a period of forty days.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, there is yet another difference[2771] in the\r\nmistletoe; that which grows upon the trees which lose their leaves,\r\nloses its leaves as well; while, on the other hand, that which grows\r\nupon evergreens always retains its leaves. In whatever way the seed\r\nmay have been sown, it will never come to anything, unless it has been\r\nfirst swallowed[2772] and then voided by birds, the wood-pigeon more\r\nparticularly, and the thrush: such being the nature of the plant, that\r\nit will not come to anything unless the seed is first ripened in the\r\ncrop of the bird. It never exceeds a single cubit in height, and is\r\nalways green and branchy. The male[2773] plant is fruitful, the female\r\nbarren; sometimes, indeed, the male even bears no berry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 94.—THE METHOD OF MAKING BIRDLIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nBirdlime is made of the berries of the mistletoe, which are gathered\r\nat harvest, and while in an unripe state; for if the rainy season\r\ncomes on, though they increase in size, the viscous juice is apt to\r\nlose its virtues. They are then dried,[2774] and when brought to a\r\nstate of perfect aridity, are first pounded, and then put in water,\r\nin which they are left to rot for twelve days; this being, in fact,\r\nthe only thing that finds improvement in decay. After this, they are\r\nagain beaten in running water with a mallet, and after losing the outer\r\ncoat there is only the viscous inner pulp remaining. This substance\r\nis birdlime; and after it has been thinned by the addition of walnut\r\noil, it is found particularly useful for catching birds, it being quite\r\nsufficient if they only touch it with the wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 95.—HISTORICAL FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE MISTLETOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion we must not omit to mention the admiration that is\r\nlavished upon this plant by the Gauls. The Druids—for that is the name\r\nthey give to their magicians[2775]—held nothing more sacred than the\r\nmistletoe and the tree that bears it, supposing always that tree to\r\nbe the robur.[2776] Of itself the robur is selected by them to form\r\nwhole groves, and they perform none of their religious rites without\r\nemploying branches of it; so much so, that it is very probable that\r\nthe priests themselves may have received their name from the Greek\r\nname[2777] for that tree. In fact, it is the notion with them that\r\neverything that grows on it has been sent immediately from heaven, and\r\nthat the mistletoe upon it is a proof that the tree has been selected\r\nby God himself as an object of his especial favour.\r\n\r\nThe mistletoe, however, is but rarely found upon the robur; and when\r\nfound, is gathered with rites replete with religious awe. This is done\r\nmore particularly on the fifth day of the moon, the day which is the\r\nbeginning of their months and years, as also of their ages, which, with\r\nthem, are but thirty years. This day they select because the moon,\r\nthough not yet in the middle of her course, has already considerable\r\npower and influence; and they call her by a name which signifies, in\r\ntheir language, the all-healing.[2778] Having made all due preparation\r\nfor the sacrifice and a banquet beneath the trees, they bring thither\r\ntwo white bulls, the horns of which are bound then for the first\r\ntime. Clad in a white robe the priest ascends the tree, and cuts the\r\nmistletoe with a golden sickle, which is received by others in a white\r\ncloak.[2779] They then immolate the victims, offering up their prayers\r\nthat God will render this gift of his propitious to those to whom he\r\nhas so granted it. It is the belief with them that the mistletoe, taken\r\nin drink, will impart fecundity to all animals that are barren, and\r\nthat it is an antidote for all poisons.[2780] Such are the religious\r\nfeelings which we find entertained towards trifling objects among\r\nnearly all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, one\r\nthousand one hundred and thirty-five.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—M.

(1.)—TREES WHICH HAVE BEEN SOLD AT ENORMOUS PRICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have described the trees which grow spontaneously on land and in\r\nthe sea,[2802] and it now remains for us to speak of those which owe\r\ntheir formation, properly speaking, rather than birth, to art and the\r\ninventive genius of man.[2803] Here, however, I cannot but express my\r\nsurprise, that after the state of penury in which man lived, as already\r\ndescribed,[2804] in primitive times, holding the trees of the forest in\r\ncommon with the wild beasts, and disputing with them the possession of\r\nthe fruits that fell, and with the fowls of the air that of the fruits\r\nas they hung on the tree, luxury has now attached to them prices so\r\nenormous.\r\n\r\nThe most famous instance, in my opinion, of this excess, was that\r\ndisplayed by L. Crassus and Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus. Crassus\r\nwas one of the most celebrated of the Roman orators; his house was\r\nremarkable for its magnificence, though in some measure surpassed even\r\nby that of Q. Catulus,[2805] also upon the Palatine Hill; the same\r\nCatulus, who, in conjunction with C. Marius, defeated the Cimbri.\r\nBut by far the finest house of all that period, it was universally\r\nacknowledged, was that of C. Aquilius, a Roman of Equestrian rank,\r\nsituate upon the Viminal Hill; a house, indeed, that conferred a\r\ngreater degree of celebrity upon him than even his acquaintance\r\nwith the civil law. This, however, did not prevent Crassus being\r\nreproached with the magnificence of his. Crassus and Domitius, members,\r\nboth of them, of the most illustrious families, after holding the\r\nconsulship,[2806] were appointed jointly to the censorship, in the year\r\nfrom the building of the City 662, a period of office that was fruitful\r\nin strife, the natural result of their dissimilarity of character. On\r\none occasion, Cneius Domitius, naturally a man of hasty temper, and\r\ninflamed besides by a hatred that rivalry only tends to stimulate,\r\ngravely rebuked Crassus for living, and he a Censor too, in a style of\r\nsuch magnificence, and in a house for which, as he said, he himself\r\nwould be ready to pay down ten millions of sesterces. Crassus, a man\r\nwho united to singular presence of mind great readiness of wit, made\r\nanswer that, deducting six trees only, he would accept the offer; upon\r\nwhich Domitius replied, that upon those terms he would not give so much\r\nas a single denarius for the purchase. “Well then, Domitius,” was the\r\nrejoinder of Crassus, “which of the two is it that sets a bad example,\r\nand deserves the reproof of the censorship; I, who live like a plain\r\nman in a house that has come to me by inheritance, or you, who estimate\r\nsix trees at a value of ten millions of sesterces?”[2807] These trees\r\nwere of the lotus[2808] kind, and by the exuberance of their branches\r\nafforded a most delightful shade. Cæcina Largus, one of the grandees\r\nof Rome, and the owner of the house, used often to point them out to\r\nme in my younger days; and, as I have already made mention[2809] of\r\nthe remarkable longevity of trees, I would here add, that they were\r\nin existence down to the period when the Emperor Nero set fire to the\r\nCity, one hundred and eighty years after the time of Crassus; being\r\nstill green and with all the freshness of youth upon them, had not that\r\nprince thought fit to hasten the death of the very trees even.\r\n\r\nLet no one, however, imagine that the house of Crassus was of no value\r\nin other respects, or that, from the rebuke of Domitius, there was\r\nnothing about it worthy of remark with the exception of these trees.\r\nThere were to be seen erected in the atrium four columns of marble\r\nfrom Mount Hymettus,[2809] which in his ædileship he had ordered to be\r\nbrought over for the decoration of the stage;[2810] and this at a time,\r\ntoo, when no public buildings even as yet possessed any pillars made\r\nof that material. Of such recent date is the luxury and opulence which\r\nwe now enjoy, and so much greater was the value which in those days\r\ntrees were supposed to confer upon a property! A pretty good proof of\r\nwhich, was the fact that Domitius even, with all his enmity, would not\r\nkeep to the offer he had made, if the trees were not to be included in\r\nthe bargain.\r\n\r\nThe trees have furnished surnames also to the ancients,[2811] such,\r\nfor instance, as that of Fronditius to the warrior who swam across\r\nthe Volturnus with a wreath of leaves on his head, and distinguished\r\nhimself by his famous exploits in the war against Hannibal; and that\r\nof Stolo[2812] to the Licinian family, such being the name given by\r\nus to the useless suckers that shoot from trees; the best method of\r\nclearing away these shoots was discovered by the first Stolo, and hence\r\nhis name. The ancient laws also took the trees under their protection;\r\nand by the Twelve Tables it was enacted, that he who should wrongfully\r\ncut down trees belonging to another person, should pay twenty-five\r\nasses for each. Is it possible then to imagine that they, who estimated\r\nthe fruit-trees at so low a rate as this, could ever have supposed\r\nthat so exorbitant a value would be put upon the lotus as that which\r\nI have just mentioned? And no less marvellous, too, are the changes\r\nthat have taken place in the value of fruit; for at the present day\r\nwe find the fruit alone of many of the trees in the suburbs valued at\r\nno less a sum than two thousand sesterces; the profits derived from\r\na single tree thus being more than those of a whole estate in former\r\ntimes. It was from motives of gain that the grafting of trees and the\r\npropagation thereby of a spurious offspring was first devised, so that\r\nthe growth of the fruits even might be a thing interdicted to the poor.\r\nWe shall, therefore, now proceed to state in what way it is that such\r\nvast revenues are derived from these trees, and with that object shall\r\nset forth the true and most approved methods of cultivation; not taking\r\nany notice of the more common methods, or those which we find generally\r\nadopted, but considering only those points of doubt and uncertainty,\r\nin relation to which practical men are most apt to find themselves at\r\na loss: while, at the same time, to affect any scrupulous exactness\r\nin cases where there is no necessity for it, will be no part of our\r\npurpose. In the first place, however, we will consider in a general\r\npoint of view, those influences of soil as well as weather which are\r\nexercised upon all the trees in common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (2.)—THE INFLUENCE OF WEATHER UPON THE TREES: WHAT IS THE\r\nPROPER SITUATION FOR THE VINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees are fond of a site more particularly that faces the\r\nnorth-east;[2813] the breezes rendering their foliage more thick and\r\nexuberant, and imparting additional solidity to the wood. This is a\r\npoint, however, upon which most people are very greatly deceived; thus\r\nin vineyards, for instance, the props ought not to be placed in such\r\na position as to shelter the stems from the wind in that quarter, it\r\nbeing only against the northern blasts that this precaution should\r\nbe taken. Nay, even more than this—if the cold weather only comes on\r\nin due season, it contributes very materially to the strengthening\r\nof the trees, and promotes the process of germination; while, on the\r\nother hand, if at that period the southern[2814] breezes should caress\r\nthem, they will grow weak and languid, and more particularly so, if\r\nthe blossom is just coming on. If rainy weather, too, should happen to\r\nfollow close upon blossoming, the total destruction of the fruit is\r\nthe necessary result: indeed, if the weather should be only cloudy, or\r\nsouth winds happen to prevail, it is quite sufficient to ensure the\r\nloss of the fruit in the almond and the pear.[2815] Rains, if prevalent\r\nabout the rising of the Vergiliæ,[2816] are most injurious to the vine\r\nand the olive,[2817] as it is at that season that germination[2818]\r\nis commencing with them; indeed, this is a most critical four days\r\nfor the olive, being the period at which the south wind, as we have\r\nalready[2819] stated, brings on its dark and lowering clouds. The\r\ncereals, too, ripen more unfavourably when south winds prevail, though\r\nat the same time it proceeds with greater rapidity. All cold, too, is\r\ninjurious to vegetation, which comes with the northern winds, or out of\r\nthe proper season. It is most advantageous to all plants for north-east\r\nwinds[2820] to prevail throughout the winter.\r\n\r\nIn this season, too, showers are very necessary, and the reason is\r\nself-evident—the trees, being exhausted by the fruit they have borne,\r\nand weakened by the loss of their leaves, are, of course, famished and\r\nhungry; and it is the showers that constitute their aliment. Experience\r\nhas led us to believe that there is nothing more detrimental than a\r\nwarm winter; for it allows the trees, the moment they have parted with\r\ntheir fruits, to conceive again, or, in other words, to germinate, and\r\nthen exhaust themselves by blossoming afresh. And what is even worse\r\nthan this, should there be several years of such weather in succession,\r\neven the trees themselves will die; for there can be little doubt\r\nthat the effort must of necessity be injurious, when they put forth\r\ntheir strength, and are at the same time deprived of their natural\r\nsustenance. The poet[2821] then, who has said that serene winters are\r\nto be desired, certainly did not express those wishes in favour of the\r\ntrees. And no more does rain, if prevalent at the summer-solstice,\r\nconduce to the benefit[2822] of the vine: while, at the same time, to\r\nsay that a dusty winter produces a luxuriant harvest, is certainly\r\nthe mistake of a too fertile imagination. It is a thing greatly to\r\nbe wished, too, both in behalf of the trees as well as the cereals,\r\nthat the snows should lie for a considerable time upon the ground; the\r\nreason being that they check the escape of the spirit of the earth by\r\nevaporation, and tend to throw it back again upon the roots of the\r\nplants, adding greatly to their strength thereby; and not only this,\r\nbut they afford a gradual supply of moisture as well, that is both pure\r\nand of remarkable lightness, from the fact that snow is only the foam\r\nof the waters of heaven. Hence it is that the moisture of snow does\r\nnot drench and engulph everything all at once, but gradually trickles\r\ndownwards, in proportion to the thirst of the plant, nurturing it as\r\nthough from the breast, instead of producing an inundation. The earth,\r\ntoo, ferments under this influence, and becomes filled with her own\r\nemanations: not exhausted by the seeds in her bosom, swollen as they\r\nare with milk,[2823] she smiles in the warm and balmy hours, when the\r\ntime comes for opening it. It is in this way, more particularly, that\r\ncorn fattens apace, except, indeed, in those climates in which the\r\natmosphere is always warm, Egypt for example; for there the continuance\r\nof the same temperature and the force of habit are productive of the\r\nsame effects as the modifications of temperature in other countries.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is equally necessary in every climate that there\r\nshould be no noxious influence in existence. Thus, for instance, in the\r\ngreater part of the world, that precocious germination which has been\r\nencouraged by the indulgent temperature of the weather, is sure to be\r\nnipped by the intense colds that ensue. Hence it is that late winters\r\nare so injurious, and such they prove to the trees of the forest even;\r\nindeed, these last are more particularly exposed to the ill effects of\r\na late winter, oppressed as they are by the density of their foliage,\r\nand human agency being unable to succour them; for it would be quite\r\nimpossible to cover[2824] the more tender forest trees with wisps of\r\nstraw. Rains, then, are favourable to vegetation—first of all, during\r\nthe winter season, and next, just previously to germination; the third\r\nperiod for them being that of the formation of the fruit, though not\r\nimmediately, and only, in fact, when the produce of the tree shows\r\nitself strong and healthy.\r\n\r\nThose trees which are the slowest in bringing their fruits to\r\nmaturity, and require a more prolonged supply of nutriment, receive\r\nbenefit also from late rains, such as the vine, the olive, and the\r\npomegranate, for instance. These rains, however, are required at\r\ndifferent seasons by the different trees, some of them coming to\r\nmaturity at one period and some at another; hence it is that we see\r\nthe very same rain productive of injury to some trees and beneficial\r\nto others, even when they are of the very same species, as in the\r\npear for instance: for the winter pear stands in need of rain at one\r\nperiod, and the early pear at another, though at the same time they,\r\nall of them, require it in an equal degree. Winter precedes the period\r\nof germination, and it is this fact that makes the north-east wind\r\nmore beneficial than the south, and renders the parts that lie in the\r\ninterior preferable to those near the coast,—the former being generally\r\nthe coldest,—mountainous districts better than level ones, and rain\r\nat night better than showers in the day. Vegetation, too, receives\r\na greater degree of benefit from the water when the sun does not\r\nimmediately soak it up.\r\n\r\nConnected, too, with this subject is the question of the best\r\nsituation for planting vines, and the trees which support them.\r\nVirgil[2825] condemns a western aspect, while there are some persons,\r\nagain, who prefer it to an easterly one: I find, however, that most\r\nauthors approve of the south, though I do not think that any abstract\r\nprecepts[2826] can be given in relation to the point. The most careful\r\nattention on the part of the cultivator ought to be paid to the\r\nnature of the soil, the character of the locality, and the respective\r\ninfluences of climate. The method of giving to the vine a southern\r\naspect, as practised in Africa and * * * * is injurious to the tree, as\r\nwell as unhealthy for the cultivator, from the very circumstance that\r\nthe country itself lies under a southern meridian: hence it is, that\r\nhe who selects for his plants there a western or a northerly aspect,\r\nwill combine on the most advantageous terms the benefits of soil with\r\nthose of climate. When Virgil condemns a western aspect, there can be\r\nno doubt that he includes in his censure a northern aspect as well: and\r\nyet, in Cisalpine Italy, where most of the vineyards have an aspect to\r\nthe north, it has been found by experience that there are none that are\r\nmore prolific.\r\n\r\nThe winds are also a very important consideration. In the provinces\r\nof Gallia Narbonensis, and in Liguria and part of Etruria, it is\r\nconsidered a proof of great want of skill to plant the vine on a site\r\nthat lies in the teeth of the wind Circius,[2827] while, on the other\r\nhand, it is a mark of prudence to catch its breezes in an oblique\r\ndirection; it is this wind, in fact, that modifies the heat in those\r\ncountries, though at the same time it is usually so violent, as to\r\nsweep away the roofs of the houses.\r\n\r\n(3.) There are some persons who employ a method of making the question\r\nof weather dependent upon the nature of the soil; thus in the case of\r\na vineyard, for instance, in a dry locality, they give it an eastern\r\nor a northern aspect; but where it is planted on a humid site, it is\r\nmade to face the south. From the varieties of the vine also, they\r\nborrow various modifications in reference to site; taking care to plant\r\nthe early vine in a cold locality, in order that the fruit may ripen\r\nbefore the frosts come on; while such fruit trees and vines as have\r\nan antipathy to dews are exposed to the east, that the sun may carry\r\noff their humidity at the earliest moment. On the other hand, such\r\nas manifest a partiality to dews are planted with a western or even\r\na northern aspect, to give them an opportunity of enjoying them all\r\nthe longer. Others, again, borrowing their notions pretty nearly from\r\nNature, have recommended that vines and trees should be planted facing\r\nthe north-east; indeed Democritus is of opinion, that by so doing the\r\nfruit will be all the more odoriferous.\r\n\r\n(4.) We have already spoken, in the Second Book,[2828] of the points\r\nof the north-east and other winds, and shall have occasion in the\r\nsucceeding one to make mention of several more of the heavenly\r\nphænomena. In the mean time, however, we may observe that it would\r\nappear to be a manifest proof of the salubrity of a north-east site,\r\nthat the leaves are always the first to fall in the trees that have\r\nan aspect towards the south.[2829] A similar reason exists, too, in\r\nthe maritime districts; in certain localities the sea breezes are\r\ndetrimental, though in most they are nutritious. For some plants,\r\nagain, it is pleasant to behold the sea at a distance, while at the\r\nsame time they will gain nothing by approaching closer to its saline\r\nexhalations. The same, too, is the influence exercised by rivers and\r\nlakes; they will either scorch the vegetation by the fogs they emit,\r\nor else modify by their coolness the excess of heat. We have already\r\nmentioned[2830] the plants that thrive in the shade, and in the cold\r\neven; but in all these matters experience will be found the best of\r\nguides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—WHAT SOILS ARE TO BE CONSIDERED THE BEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext after the influences of the heavens, we have to treat of those of\r\nthe earth, a task that is in no way more easy than the previous one.\r\nIt is but rarely that the same soil is found suited to trees as well\r\nas corn: indeed, the black[2831] earth which prevails in Campania is\r\nnot everywhere found suited to the vine, nor yet that which emits light\r\nexhalations, or the red[2832] soil that has been so highly praised\r\nby many. The cretaceous earth that is found in the territory of Alba\r\nPompeia, and an argillaceous soil, are preferred to all others for\r\nthe vine, although, too, they are remarkably rich, a quality that is\r\ngenerally looked upon as not suited to that plant. On the other hand,\r\nagain, the white sand of the district of Ticinum, the black sand of\r\nmany other places, and the red sand as well, even though mixed with a\r\nrich earth, will prove unproductive.\r\n\r\nThe very signs, also, from which we form our judgment are often very\r\ndeceptive; a soil that is adorned with tall and graceful trees is not\r\nalways a favourable one, except, of course, for those trees. What tree,\r\nin fact, is there that is taller than the fir? and yet what other plant\r\ncould possibly exist in the same spot? Nor ought we always to look upon\r\nverdant pastures as so many proofs of richness of soil; for what is\r\nthere that enjoys a greater renown than the pastures of Germany? and\r\nyet they consist of nothing but a very thin layer of turf, with sand\r\nimmediately beneath. Nor yet is the soil which produces herbage[2833]\r\nof large growth always to be looked upon as humid; no, by Hercules!\r\nno more than a soil is to be looked upon as unctuous and rich, which\r\nadheres to the fingers—a thing that is proved in the case of the\r\nargillaceous earths.[2834] The earth when thrown back into the hole\r\nfrom which it has just been dug will never[2835] fill it, so that it is\r\nquite impossible by that method to form any opinion as to its density\r\nor thinness. It is the fact, too, that every[2836] soil, without\r\nexception, will cover iron with rust. Nor yet can we determine[2837]\r\nthe heaviness or lightness of soils in relation to any fixed and\r\nascertained weight: for what are we to understand as the standard\r\nweight of earth? A soil, too, that is formed from the alluvion[2838] of\r\nrivers is not always to be recommended, for there are some crops that\r\ndecay all the sooner in a watery soil; indeed, those soils even of this\r\ndescription which are highly esteemed, are never found to be long good\r\nfor any kind of vegetation but the willow.\r\n\r\nAmong other proofs of the goodness of soil, is the comparative\r\nthickness of the stem in corn. In Laborium, a famous champaign country\r\nof Campania, the stalk is of such remarkable thickness, that it may be\r\nused even to supply the place of wood:[2839] and yet this very soil,\r\nfrom the difficulty that is everywhere experienced in cultivating it,\r\nand the labour required in working it, may be almost said to give the\r\nhusbandman more trouble by its good qualities than it could possibly\r\nhave done by reason of any defects. The soil, too, that is generally\r\nknown as charcoal earth, appears susceptible of being improved by being\r\nplanted with a poor meagre vine: and tufa,[2840] which is naturally\r\nrough and friable, we find recommended by some authors. Virgil,[2841]\r\ntoo, does not condemn for the vine a soil which produces fern:[2842]\r\nwhile a salted earth[2843] is thought to be much better entrusted with\r\nthe growth of vegetation than any other, from the fact of its being\r\ncomparatively safe from noxious insects breeding there. Declivities,\r\ntoo, are far from unproductive, if a person only knows how to dig\r\nthem properly; and it is not all[2844] champaign spots that are less\r\naccessible to the sun and wind than is necessary for their benefit. We\r\nhave already[2845] alluded to the fact, that there are certain vines\r\nwhich find nutriment in hoar frosts and fogs.\r\n\r\nIn every subject there are certain deep and recondite secrets, which\r\nit is left to the intelligence of each to penetrate. Do we not,\r\nfor instance, find it the fact, that soils which have long offered\r\nopportunities for a sound judgment being formed on their qualities\r\nhave become totally altered? In the vicinity of Larissa, in Thessaly,\r\na lake was drained;[2846] and the consequence was, that the district\r\nbecame much colder, and the olive-trees which had formerly borne\r\nfruit now ceased to bear. When a channel was cut for the Hebrus, near\r\nthe town of Ænos, the place was sensible of its nearer approach, in\r\nfinding its vines frost-bitten, a thing that had never happened before;\r\nin the vicinity, too, of Philippi, the country having been drained\r\nfor cultivation, the nature of the climate became entirely altered.\r\nIn the territory of Syracuse, a husbandman, who was a stranger to\r\nthe place, cleared the soil of all the stones, and the consequence\r\nwas, that he lost his crops from the accumulation of mud; so that at\r\nlast he was obliged to carry the stones back again. In Syria again,\r\nthe plough-share which they use is narrow, and the furrows are but\r\nvery superficial, there being a rock beneath the soil that in summer\r\nscorches up the seeds.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the effects of excessive cold and heat in various places\r\nare similar; thus, for instance, Thrace is fruitful in corn, by reason\r\nof the cold, while Africa and Egypt are so in consequence of the heat\r\nthat prevails there. At Chalcia,[2847] an island belonging to the\r\nRhodians, there is a certain place which is so remarkably fertile,\r\nthat after reaping the barley that has been sown at the ordinary time,\r\nand gathering it in, they immediately sow a fresh crop, and reap it at\r\nthe same time as the other corn. A gravelly soil is found best suited\r\nfor the olive in the district of Venafrum,[2848] while one of extreme\r\nrichness is required for it in Bætica. The wines of Pucinum[2849] are\r\nripened upon a rock, and the vines of Cæcubum[2850] are moistened by\r\nthe waters of the Pomptine[2851] marshes; so great are the differences\r\nthat have been detected by human experience in the various soils. Cæsar\r\nVopiscus, when pleading a cause before the Censors, said that the\r\nfields of Rosia[2852] are the very marrow[2853] of Italy, and that a\r\nstake, left in the ground there one day, would be found covered by the\r\ngrass the next:[2854] the soil, however, is only esteemed there for the\r\npurposes of pasturage. Still, however, Nature has willed that we should\r\nnot remain uninstructed, and has made full admission as to existing\r\ndefects in soil, even in cases where she has failed to give us equal\r\ninformation as to its good qualities: we shall begin, therefore, by\r\nspeaking of the defects that are found in various soils.\r\n\r\n(5.) If it is the wish of a person to test whether a soil is bitter,\r\nor whether it is thin and meagre, the fact may be easily ascertained\r\nfrom the presence of black and undergrown herbs. If, again, the herbage\r\nshoots up dry and stunted, it shows that the soil is cold, and if sad\r\nand languid, that it is moist and slimy. The eye, too, is able to judge\r\nwhether it is a red earth or whether it is argillaceous, both of them\r\nextremely difficult to work, and apt to load the harrow or ploughshare\r\nwith enormous clods; though at the same time it should be borne in\r\nmind that the soil which entails the greatest amount of labour is not\r\nalways productive of the smallest amount of profit. So, too, on the\r\nother hand, the eye can distinguish a soil that is mixed with ashes or\r\nwith white sand, while earth that is sterile and dense may be easily\r\ndetected by its peculiar hardness, at even a single stroke of the\r\nmattock.\r\n\r\nCato,[2855] briefly and in his peculiar manner, characterizes the\r\ndefects that exist in the various soils. “Take care,” he says, “where\r\nthe earth is rotten not to shake it either with carts or by driving\r\ncattle over it.” Now what are we to suppose that this term “rotten”\r\nmeans, as applied to a soil, about which he is so vastly apprehensive\r\nas to almost forbid our setting foot upon it? Let us only form a\r\ncomparison by thinking what it is that constitutes rottenness in\r\nwood, and we shall find that the faults which are held by him in such\r\naversion are the being arid, full of holes, rough, white, mouldy,\r\nworm-eaten, in fact, just like pumice-stone; and thus has Cato said\r\nmore in a single word than we could have possibly found means to\r\nexpress in a description, however long. Indeed, if we could find means\r\nof expressing the various defects that exist in soils, we should\r\nfind that there are some of them that are old, not with age (for age\r\ncannot[2856] be concerned in relation to the earth), but of their own\r\nnature, and are hence unfruitful and powerless for every purpose from\r\nthe first. The same writer,[2857] too, considers that as the very best\r\nof soils, which, situate at the foot of a declivity, runs out into a\r\nchampaign country, taking a southward direction; such, in fact, being\r\nthe aspect of the whole of Italy:[2858] he says[2859] also, that the\r\nearth generally known as black[2860] earth is of a tender nature,\r\nand is consequently the most easily worked and the best for cereals.\r\nIf we only appreciate with due care the signification of this word\r\n“tender,”[2861] we shall find that it expresses its intended meaning\r\nremarkably well, and that in this word is comprised every quality that\r\nis desirable for the purposes of cultivation. In a tender soil we\r\nshall find fertility combined with moderation, a softness and a pliancy\r\neasily adapted to cultivation, and an equal absence of humidity and of\r\ndryness. Earth of this nature will shine again after the plough-share\r\nhas passed through it, just as Homer,[2862] that great fountain-head of\r\nall genius, has described it sculptured by the Divinity[2863] upon the\r\narms [of Achilles], adding, too, a thing that is truly marvellous, that\r\nit was of a blackish hue, though gold was the material in which it was\r\nwrought. This, too, is that kind of earth, which, when newly turned up,\r\nattracts the ravenous birds that follow the plough-share, the ravens\r\neven going so far as to peck at the heels of the ploughman.\r\n\r\nWe may in this place appropriately make mention of an opinion that has\r\nbeen pronounced by an Italian writer also with reference to a matter of\r\nluxury. Cicero,[2864] that other luminary of literature, has made the\r\nfollowing remark: “Those unguents which have a taste of earth[2865] are\r\nbetter,” says he, “than those which smack of saffron;” it seeming to\r\nhim more to the purpose to express himself by the word “taste”[2866]\r\nthan “smell.” And such is the fact, no doubt; that soil is the best\r\nwhich has the flavour of a perfume.[2867] If the question should be put\r\nto us, what is this odour of the earth that is held in such estimation,\r\nour answer is, that it is the same that is often to be recognized at\r\nthe moment of sunset, without the necessity even of turning up the\r\nground, at the spots where the extremities of the rainbow[2868] have\r\nbeen observed to meet the earth; as also when, after long-continued\r\ndrought, the rain has soaked the ground. Then it is that the earth\r\nexhales this divine odour, that is so peculiarly its own, and to which,\r\nimparted to it by the sun, there is no perfume, however sweet, that can\r\npossibly be compared. It is this odour that the earth, when turned up,\r\nought to emit, and which, when once found, can never deceive a person;\r\nand this will be found the best criterion for judging of the quality of\r\nthe soil. Such, too, is the odour that is usually perceived on land\r\nnewly cleared,[2869] when an ancient forest has been just cut down; its\r\nexcellence is a thing that is universally admitted.\r\n\r\nFor the culture of the cereals, too, the same land is generally looked\r\nupon as the more improved the oftener it has been allowed to rest[2870]\r\nfrom cultivation, a thing that is not the case with vineyards; for\r\nwhich reason all the greater care is required in the selection of\r\ntheir site, if we would not have the opinions of those to appear well\r\nfounded who entertain the notion that the soil of Italy is already\r\nworn out.[2871] In other kinds of soil the work of cultivation depends\r\nentirely upon the weather; as, for instance, in those which cannot\r\nbe ploughed just after rain, because the natural exuberance of the\r\nearth renders it viscous and cloggy. On the other hand, in Byzacium, a\r\ndistrict of Africa, and a champaign country of such singular fertility\r\nas to render grain one hundred and fifty fold,[2872] the soil is such,\r\nthat in time of drought, not even bulls are able to plough it; while,\r\non another occasion, just after a shower of rain, one poor ass, with\r\nan old woman to guide it, is quite sufficient,[2873] as ourselves we\r\nhave witnessed, to do the ploughing. But as to amending one soil by\r\nthe agency of another, as some persons recommend, by throwing rich\r\nearth over one that is poor and thin, or by laying a soaking light\r\nsoil over one that is humid and unctuous, it is a labour of perfect\r\nmadness.[2874] What can a man possibly hope for who cultivates such a\r\nsoil as this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (6.)—THE EIGHT KINDS OF EARTH BOASTED OF BY THE GAULS AND\r\nGREEKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another method, which has been invented both in Gaul and\r\nBritain, of enriching earth by the agency of itself, being * * * * and\r\nthat kind known as marl.[2875] This soil is looked upon as containing a\r\ngreater amount of fecundating principles, and acts as a fat in relation\r\nto the earth, just as we find glands existing in the body, which are\r\nformed by a condensation of the fatty particles into so many kernels.\r\n(7.) This mode of proceeding, too, has not been overlooked by the\r\nGreeks; indeed, what subject is there that they have not touched upon?\r\nThey call by the name of leucargillon[2876] a white argillaceous earth\r\nwhich is used in the territory of Megara, but only where the soil is of\r\na moist, cold nature.\r\n\r\nIt is only right that I should employ some degree of care and\r\nexactness in treating of this marl, which tends so greatly to enrich\r\nthe soil of the Gallic provinces and the British islands. There were\r\nformerly but two varieties known, but more recently, with the progress\r\nof agricultural knowledge, several[2877] others have begun to be\r\nemployed; there being, in fact, the white, the red, the columbine, the\r\nargillaceous, the tufaceous, and the sandy marls. It has also one of\r\nthese two peculiarities, it is either rough or greasy to the touch; the\r\nproper mode of testing it being by the hand. Its uses, too, are of a\r\ntwofold nature—it is employed for the production of the cereals only,\r\nor else for the enrichment of pasture land as well. The tufaceous[2878]\r\nkind is nutrimental to grain, and so is the white; if found in the\r\nvicinity of springs, it is fertile to an immeasurable extent; but if it\r\nis rough to the touch, when laid upon the land in too large a quantity,\r\nit is apt to burn up the soil. The next kind is the red marl, known\r\nas acaunumarga,[2879] consisting of stones mingled with a thin sandy\r\nearth. These stones are broken upon the land itself, and it is with\r\nconsiderable difficulty during the earlier years that the stalk of the\r\ncorn is cut, in consequence of the presence of these stones; however,\r\nas it is remarkably light, it only costs for carriage one-half of the\r\noutlay required in using the other varieties. It is laid but very\r\nthinly on the surface, and it is generally thought that it is mixed\r\nwith salt. Both of these varieties, when once laid on the land, will\r\nfertilize it for fifty[2880] years, whether for grain or for hay.\r\n\r\n(8.) Of the marls that are found to be of an unctuous nature, the best\r\nis the white. There are several varieties of it: the most pungent\r\nand biting being the one already mentioned. Another kind, is the\r\nwhite chalk that is used for cleaning[2881] silver; it is taken from\r\na considerable depth in the ground, the pits being sunk, in most\r\ninstances, as much as one hundred feet. These pits are narrow at the\r\nmouth, but the shafts enlarge very considerably in the interior, as is\r\nthe case in mines; it is in Britain more particularly that this chalk\r\nis employed. The good effects of it are found to last full eighty\r\nyears; and there is no instance known of an agriculturist laying it\r\ntwice on the same land during his life.[2882] A third variety of white\r\nmarl is known as glisomarga;[2883] it consists of fullers’ chalk[2884]\r\nmixed with an unctuous earth, and is better for promoting the growth\r\nof hay than grain; so much so, in fact, that between harvest and the\r\nensuing seed-time there is cut a most abundant crop of grass. While the\r\ncorn is growing, however, it will allow no other plant to grow there.\r\nIts effects will last so long as thirty years; but if laid too thickly\r\non the ground, it is apt to choke up the soil, just as if it had been\r\ncovered with Signine[2885] cement. The Gauls give to the columbine marl\r\nin their language the name of eglecopala;[2886] it is taken up in\r\nsolid blocks like stone, after which it is so loosened by the action of\r\nthe sun and frost, as to split into laminæ of extreme thinness; this\r\nkind is equally beneficial for grass and grain. The sandy[2887] marl is\r\nemployed if there is no other at hand, and on moist slimy soils, even\r\nwhen other kinds can be procured.\r\n\r\nThe Ubii are the only people that we know of, who, having an extremely\r\nfertile soil to cultivate, employ methods of enriching it; wherever\r\nthe land may happen to be, they dig to a depth of three feet, and,\r\ntaking up the earth, cover the soil with it in other places a foot\r\nin thickness; this method, however, to be beneficial, requires to\r\nbe renewed at the end of every ten years. The Ædui and the Pictones\r\nhave rendered their lands remarkably fertile by the aid of limestone,\r\nwhich is also found to be particularly beneficial to the olive and\r\nthe vine.[2888] Every marl, however, requires to be laid on the land\r\nimmediately after ploughing, in order that the soil may at once imbibe\r\nits properties; while at the same time, it requires a little manure as\r\nwell, as it is apt, at first, to be of too acrid a nature, at least\r\nwhere it is not pasture land that it is laid upon; in addition to\r\nwhich, by its very freshness it may possibly injure the soil, whatever\r\nthe nature of it may be; so much so, indeed, that the land is never\r\nfertile the first year after it has been employed. It is a matter of\r\nconsideration also for what kind of soil the marl is required; if the\r\nsoil is moist, a dry marl is best suited for it; and if dry, a rich\r\nunctuous marl. If, on the other hand, the land is of a medium quality,\r\nchalk or columbine[2889] marl is the best suited for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (9.)—THE EMPLOYMENT OF ASHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agriculturists of the parts of Italy beyond the river Padus, are\r\nsuch admirers of ashes[2890] for this purpose, that they even prefer\r\nit as a manure to the dung of beasts of burden; indeed, they are in\r\nthe habit of burning dung for this purpose, on account of its superior\r\nlightness. They do not, however, use them indiscriminately upon the\r\nsame soil, nor do they employ ashes for promoting the growth of shrubs,\r\nnor, in fact, of some of the cereals, as we shall have occasion[2891]\r\nto mention hereafter. There are some persons who are of opinion also\r\nthat dust[2892] imparts nutriment to grapes, and cover them with it\r\nwhile they are growing, taking care to throw it also upon the roots\r\nof the vines and other trees. It is well known that this is done in\r\nthe province of Gallia Narbonensis, and it is a fact even better\r\nascertained that the grape ripens all the sooner for it; indeed, the\r\ndust there contributes more to its ripeness than the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are various kinds of manure, the use of which is of very ancient\r\ndate. In the times of Homer[2893] even, the aged king is represented\r\nas thus enriching the land by the labour of his own hands. Tradition\r\nreports that King Augeas was the first in Greece to make use of it, and\r\nthat Hercules introduced the practice into Italy; which country has,\r\nhowever, immortalized the name of its king, Stercutus,[2894] the son\r\nof Faunus, as claiming the honour of this invention. M. Varro[2895]\r\nassigns the first rank for excellence to the dung of thrushes kept in\r\naviaries, and lauds it as being not only good for land, but excellent\r\nfood for oxen and swine as well; indeed, he goes so far as to assert\r\nthat there is no food that they will grow fat upon more speedily. We\r\nreally have some reason to augur well of the manners of the present\r\nday, if it is true that in the days of our ancestors there were\r\naviaries of such vast extent as to be able to furnish manure for the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nColumella[2896] gives the second rank to pigeon manure,[2897] and the\r\nnext to that of the poultry-yard; but he condemns that of the aquatic\r\nbirds. Some authors, again, are agreed in regarding the residue of the\r\nhuman food[2898] as the very best of all manures; while others would\r\nonly employ the superfluous portion of our drink,[2899] mixing with it\r\nthe hair that is to be found in the curriers’ workshops. Some, however,\r\nare for employing this liquid by itself, though they would mix water\r\nwith it once more, and in larger quantities even than when originally\r\nmixed with the wine at our repasts; there being a double share of\r\nnoxious qualities to correct, not only those originally belonging to\r\nthe wine,[2900] but those imparted to it by the human body as well.\r\nSuch are the various methods by which we vie with each other in\r\nimparting nutriment to the earth even.\r\n\r\nNext to the manures above mentioned, the dung of swine is highly\r\nesteemed, Columella being the only writer that condemns it. Some,\r\nagain, speak highly of the dung of all quadrupeds that have been fed\r\non cytisus, while there are others who prefer that of pigeons. Next\r\nto these is the dung of goats, and then of sheep; after which comes\r\nthat of oxen, and, last of all, of the beasts of burden. Such were\r\nthe distinctions that were established between the various manures\r\namong the ancients, such the precepts that they have left us, and\r\nthese I have here set forth as being not the mere subtle inventions\r\nof genius, but because their utility has been proved in the course of\r\na long series of years. In some of the provinces, too, which abound\r\nmore particularly in cattle, by reason of their prolific soil, we\r\nhave seen the manure passed through a sieve like so much flour, and\r\nperfectly devoid, through lapse of time,[2901] of all bad smell or\r\nrepulsive look, being changed in its appearance to something rather\r\nagreeable than otherwise. In more recent times it has been found that\r\nthe olive thrives more particularly in soil that has been manured with\r\nthe ashes[2902] of the lime-kiln. To the ancient rules Varro[2903] has\r\nadded, that corn land should be manured with horse-dung, that being\r\nthe lightest manure of all, while meadow land, he says, thrives better\r\nwith a manure of a more heavy nature, and supplied by beasts that have\r\nbeen fed upon barley; this last tending more particularly to the better\r\ngrowth of grass.[2904] Some persons, indeed, prefer the dung of the\r\nbeasts of burden to that of oxen even, the manure of the sheep to that\r\nof the goat, and the manure of the ass to all others, the reason being\r\nthat that animal masticates the most slowly of them all. Experience,\r\nhowever, has pronounced against these dicta of Varro and Columella;\r\nbut it is universally agreed by all writers that there is nothing more\r\nbeneficial than to turn[2905] up a crop of lupines, before they have\r\npodded, with either the plough or the fork, or else to cut them and\r\nbury them in heaps at the roots of trees and vines. It is thought,\r\nalso, that in places where no cattle are kept, it is advantageous to\r\nmanure the earth with stubble or even fern. “You can make manure,”\r\nCato[2906] says, “of litter, or else of lupines, straw, beanstalks, or\r\nthe leaves of the holm-oak and quercus. Pull up the wallwort from among\r\nthe crops of corn, as also the hemlock that grows there, together with\r\nthe thick grass and sedge that you find growing about the willow-plots;\r\nof all this, mixed with rotten leaves,[2907] you may make a litter for\r\nsheep and oxen. If a vine should happen to be but poor and meagre,\r\nprune[2908] the shoots of it, and plough them in round about it.” The\r\nsame author says, also,[2909] “When you are going to sow corn in a\r\nfield, fold your sheep[2910] there first.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—CROPS WHICH TEND TO IMPROVE THE LAND: CROPS WHICH EXHAUST IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCato[2911] says, also, that there are some crops which tend to nourish\r\nthe earth: thus, for instance, corn land is manured by the lupine, the\r\nbean, and the vetch; while, on the other hand, the chick-pea exercises\r\na contrary influence, both because it is pulled up by the roots and is\r\nof a salt nature; the same is the case, too, with barley, fenugreek,\r\nand fitches, all of which have a tendency to burn up[2912] corn land,\r\nas, in fact, do all those plants which are pulled up by the roots. Take\r\ncare, too, not to plant stone-fruits on corn land. Virgil[2913] is of\r\nopinion, also, that corn land is scorched by flax, oats, and poppies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—THE PROPER MODE OF USING MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is recommended,[2914] also, that the dung-heap should be kept in the\r\nopen air, in a spot deep sunk and well adapted to receive the moisture:\r\nit should be covered, too, with straw, that it may not dry up with\r\nthe sun, care being taken to drive a stake of robur into the ground,\r\nto prevent serpents from breeding[2915] there. It is of the greatest\r\nconsequence that the manure should be laid upon the land while[2916]\r\nthe west winds prevail, and during a dry moon. Most persons, however,\r\nmisunderstand this precept, and think this should be done when the west\r\nwinds are just beginning to blow, and in the month of February only;\r\nit being really the fact that most crops require manuring in other\r\nmonths as well. At whatever period, however, it may be thought proper\r\nto manure the land, the greatest care should be taken that the wind is\r\nblowing due west at the time, and that the moon is on the wane, and\r\nquite dry. Such precautions as these will increase in a most surprising\r\ndegree the fertilizing effects of manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (10.)—THE MODES IN WHICH TREES BEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now treated at sufficient length of the requisite conditions\r\nof the weather and the soil, we shall proceed to speak of those trees\r\nwhich are the result of the care and inventive skill of man. Indeed,\r\nthe varieties of them are hardly less numerous than of those which are\r\nproduced by Nature,[2917] so abundantly have we testified our gratitude\r\nin return for her numerous bounties. For these trees, we find, are\r\nreared either from seed, or else by transplanting, by layers, by slips\r\ntorn from the stock, by cuttings, by grafting, or by cutting into the\r\ntrunk of the tree. But as to the story that the leaves of the palm\r\nare planted by the Babylonians, and so give birth[2918] to a tree, I\r\nam really surprised that Trogus should have ever believed it. Some of\r\nthe trees are reproduced by several of the methods above enumerated,\r\nothers, again, by all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—PLANTS WHICH ARE PROPAGATED BY SEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is Nature herself that has taught us most of these methods, and more\r\nparticularly that of sowing seed, as it was very soon evident how the\r\nseed on falling to the ground revived again in germination. Indeed,\r\nthere are some trees that are capable of being propagated in no other\r\nway, the chesnut[2919] and the walnut, for instance; with the sole\r\nexception, of course, of such as are employed for coppice wood. By this\r\nmethod, too, as well as the others, some trees are propagated, though\r\nfrom a seed of a different nature, such, for instance, as the vine, the\r\napple, and the pear;[2920] the seed being in all these cases in the\r\nshape of a pip, and not the fruit itself, as in that of the chesnut\r\nand the walnut. The medlar, too, can also be propagated by the agency\r\nof seed. All trees, however, that are grown by this method are very\r\nslow in coming to maturity,[2921] degenerate[2922] very rapidly, and\r\nmust often be renewed by grafting: indeed, the chesnut even sometimes\r\nrequires to be grafted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—TREES WHICH NEVER DEGENERATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some trees which have the property of\r\nnever degenerating, in whatever manner they are reproduced, the\r\ncypress, palm, and laurel,[2923] for instance: for we find that the\r\nlaurel is capable of being propagated in several ways. We have already\r\nmade mention[2924] of the various kinds of laurel; those known as the\r\nAugustan, the baccalis, and the tinus[2925] are all reproduced in a\r\nsimilar manner. The berries are gathered in the month of January,\r\nafter they have been dried by the north-east winds which then prevail;\r\nthey are then kept[2926] separate and exposed to the action of the\r\nair, being liable to ferment if left in a heap. After this, they are\r\nfirst seasoned with smoke, and then steeped in urine, preparatory to\r\nsowing.[2927] Some persons put them in baskets of osier, and tread\r\nthem down with the feet in running water, until the outer skin is\r\nremoved, as it is found that the moisture[2928] which they contain is\r\ndetrimental to them, and prevents them from germinating. A trench is\r\nthen dug, about a palm in depth, and somewhere about twenty of the\r\nberries are then put into it, being laid in a heap: this is usually\r\ndone in the month of March. These kinds of laurel admit of being\r\npropagated from layers also; but the triumphal[2929] laurel can be\r\nreproduced from cuttings only.\r\n\r\nAll the varieties of the myrtle[2930] are produced in Campania from the\r\nberry only, but at Rome from layers. Democritus, however, says that the\r\nTarentine myrtle may be re-produced another way.[2931] They take the\r\nlargest berries and pound them lightly so as not to crush the pips:\r\nwith the paste that is thus made a rope is covered, and put lengthwise\r\nin the ground; the result of which is that a hedge is formed as thick\r\nas a wall, with plenty of slips for transplanting. In the same way,\r\ntoo, they plant brambles to make a hedge, by first covering a rope of\r\nrushes with a paste made of bramble-berries. In case of necessity, it\r\nis possible at the end of three years to transplant the suckers of the\r\nlaurel and the myrtle that have been thus re-produced.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the plants that are propagated from seed, Mago treats\r\nat considerable length of the nut-trees—he says that the almond[2932]\r\nshould be sown in a soft argillaceous earth, upon a spot that looks\r\ntowards the south—that it thrives also in a hard, warm soil, but\r\nthat in a soil which is either unctuous or moist, it is sure to die,\r\nor else to bear no fruit. He recommends also for sowing those more\r\nparticularly which are of a curved shape like a sickle, and the produce\r\nof a young tree, and he says that they should be steeped for three\r\ndays in diluted manure, or else the day before they are sown in honey\r\nand water.[2933] He says, also, that they should be put in the ground\r\nwith the point downwards, and the sharp edge towards the north-east;\r\nand that they should be sown in threes and placed triangularly, at the\r\ndistance of a palm from each other, care being taken to water them for\r\nten days, until such time as they have germinated.\r\n\r\nWalnuts when sown are placed lengthwise,[2934] lying upon the sides\r\nwhere the shells are joined; and pine nuts are mostly put, in sevens,\r\ninto perforated pots, or else sown in the same way as the berries are\r\nin the laurels which are re-produced by seed. The citron[2935] is\r\npropagated from pips as well as layers, and the sorb from seed, by\r\nsucker, or by slip: the citron, however, requires a warm site, the sorb\r\na cold and moist one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12.—PROPAGATION BY SUCKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature, too,[2936] has taught us the art of forming nurseries; when\r\nfrom the roots of many of the trees we see shooting up a dense forest\r\nof suckers, an offspring that is destined to be killed by the mother\r\nthat has borne them. For by the shade of the tree these suckers are\r\nindiscriminately stifled, as we often see the case in the laurel, the\r\npomegranate, the plane, the cherry, and the plum. There are some few\r\ntrees, the elm and the palm for instance, in which the branches spare\r\nthe suckers; however, they never make their appearance in any of the\r\ntrees except those in which the roots, from their fondness for the sun\r\nand rain, keep close, as they range, to the surface of the ground. It\r\nis usual not to place all these suckers at once in the ground upon the\r\nspot which they are finally to occupy, but first to entrust them to\r\nthe nursery, and to allow them to grow in seed-plots, after which they\r\nare finally transplanted. This transplanting softens down, in a most\r\nremarkable manner, those trees even which grow wild; whether it is that\r\ntrees, like men, are naturally fond of novelty and change of scene, or\r\nthat, on leaving the spots of their original growth, or to which they\r\nhave been transplanted, they lay aside their bad qualities and become\r\ntame, like the wild animals, the moment they are separated from the\r\nparent stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—PROPAGATION BY SLIPS AND CUTTINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature has also discovered another method, which is very similar to\r\nthe last—for slips torn away from the tree will live. In adopting\r\nthis plan, care should be taken to pull out the haunch[2937] of the\r\nslip where it adheres to the stock, and so remove with it a portion\r\nof the fibrous body of the parent tree. It is in this way that the\r\npomegranate, the hazel, the apple, the sorb, the medlar, the ash,\r\nthe fig, and more particularly the vine, are propagated. The quince,\r\nhowever, if planted in this way will degenerate,[2938] and it has\r\nbeen consequently found a better plan to cut slips and plant them: a\r\nmethod which was at first adopted for making hedges, with the elder,\r\nthe quince, and the bramble, but came afterwards to be applied to\r\ncultivated trees, such as the poplar, the alder, and the willow, which\r\nlast will grow if even the slip is planted upside down.[2939] In the\r\ncase of cuttings, they are planted at once in the spot which it is\r\nintended they should occupy: but before we pass on to the other methods\r\nof propagation, it seems as well to mention the care that should be\r\nexpended upon making seed-plots.[2940]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14.—SEED-PLOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn laying out a seed-plot it is necessary that a soil of the very\r\nhighest quality should be selected; for it is very often requisite\r\nthat a nurse should be provided for the young plants, who is more\r\nready to humour them than their parent soil. The ground should\r\ntherefore be both dry and nutritious, well turned up with the mattock,\r\nreplete with hospitality to the stranger plants, and as nearly as\r\npossible resembling the soil to which it is intended they should be\r\ntransplanted. But, a thing that is of primary importance, the stones\r\nmust be carefully gathered from off the ground, and it should be\r\nwalled in, to ensure its protection from the depredations of poultry;\r\nthe soil, too, should have as few chinks and crannies as possible, so\r\nthat the sun may not be enabled to penetrate and burn up the roots.\r\nThe young trees should be planted at distances[2941] of a foot and\r\na-half, for if they happen to touch one another, in addition to other\r\ninconveniences, they are apt to breed worms; for which reason it is\r\nthat they should be hoed as often as possible, and all weeds pulled up,\r\nthe young plants themselves being carefully pruned, and so accustomed\r\nto the knife.\r\n\r\nCato[2942] recommends, too, that hurdles should be set up upon forks,\r\nthe height of a man, for the purpose of intercepting the rays of\r\nthe sun, and that they should be covered with straw to keep off the\r\ncold.[2943] He says that it is in this way that the seeds of the apple\r\nand the pear are reared, the pine-nut also, and the cypress,[2944]\r\nwhich is propagated from seed as well. In this last, the seed is\r\nremarkably[2945] small, so much so, in fact, as to be scarcely\r\nperceptible. It is a marvellous fact, and one which ought not to be\r\noverlooked, that a tree should be produced from sources so minute,\r\nwhile the grains of wheat and of barley are so very much larger, not\r\nto mention the bean. What proportion, too, is there between the apple\r\nand the pear tree, and the seeds from which they take their rise? It\r\nis from such beginnings, too, as these that springs the timber that is\r\nproof against the blows of the hatchet, presses[2946] that weights of\r\nenormous size even are unable to bend, masts that support the sails\r\nof ships, and battering-rams that are able to shake even towers and\r\nwalls! Such is the might, such is the power that is displayed by\r\nNature. But, a marvel that transcends all the rest, is the fact of a\r\nvegetable receiving its birth from a tear-like drop, as we shall have\r\noccasion to mention[2947] in the appropriate place.\r\n\r\nTo resume, however: the tiny balls which contain the seed are collected\r\nfrom the female cypress—for the male, as I have already[2948] stated,\r\nis barren. This is done in the months which I have previously[2949]\r\nmentioned, and they are then dried in the sun, upon which they soon\r\nburst, and the seed drops out, a substance of which the ants are\r\nremarkably fond; this fact, too, only serves to enhance the marvel,\r\nwhen we reflect that an insect so minute is able to destroy the first\r\ngerm of a tree of such gigantic dimensions. The seed is sown in the\r\nmonth of April, the ground being first levelled with rollers, or else\r\nby means of rammers;[2950] after which the seed is thickly sown, and\r\nearth is spread upon it with a sieve, about a thumb deep. If laid\r\nbeneath a considerable weight, the seed is unable to spring up, and\r\nis consequently thrown back again into the earth; for which reason\r\nit is often trodden only into the ground. It is then lightly watered\r\nafter sunset every three days, that it may gradually imbibe the\r\nmoisture until such time as it appears above ground. The young trees\r\nare transplanted at the end of a year, when about three-quarters of\r\na foot in length, due care being taken to watch for a clear day with\r\nno wind, such being the best suited for the process of transplanting.\r\nIt is a singular thing, but still it is a fact, that if, on the day\r\nof transplanting, and only that day, there is the slightest drop of\r\nrain or the least breeze stirring, it is attended with danger[2951]\r\nto the young trees; while for the future they are quite safe from\r\nperil, though at the same time they have a great aversion to all\r\nhumidity.[2952] The jujube-tree[2953] is propagated from seed sown in\r\nthe month of April. As to the tuber,[2954] it is the best plan to graft\r\nit upon the wild plum, the quince, and the calabrix,[2955] this last\r\nbeing the name that is given to a wild thorn. Every kind of thorn, too,\r\nwill receive grafts remarkably well from the myxa plum,[2956] as well\r\nas from the sorb.\r\n\r\n(11.) As to recommending transferring the young plants from the\r\nseed-plot to another spot before finally planting them out, I look\r\nupon it as advice that would only lead to so much unnecessary trouble,\r\nalthough it is most confidently urged that by this process the leaves\r\nare sure to be considerably larger than they otherwise would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—THE MODE OF PROPAGATING THE ELM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elm seed is collected about the calends of March,[2957] before the\r\ntree is covered with leaves, but is just beginning to have a yellow\r\ntint. It is then left to dry two days in the shade, after which it is\r\nthickly sown in a broken soil, earth that has been riddled through\r\na fine sieve being thrown upon it, to the same thickness as in the\r\ncase of the cypress.[2958] If there should happen to be no rain, it\r\nis necessary to water the seed. From the nursery the young plants are\r\ncarried at the end of a year to the elm-plots, where they are planted\r\nat intervals of a foot each way. It is better to plant elms in autumn\r\nthat are to support the vine, as they are destitute[2959] of seed and\r\nare only propagated from plants. In the vicinity of the City, the\r\nyoung elms are transplanted into the vineyard at five years old, or,\r\naccording to the plan adopted by some, when they are twenty feet in\r\nheight. A furrow is first drawn for the purpose, the name given to\r\nwhich is “novenarius,”[2960] being three feet in depth, and the same\r\nin breadth or even more; into this the young tree is put, and the\r\nearth is moulded up around it to the height of three feet every way.\r\nThese mounds are known by the name of “arula”[2961] in Campania. The\r\nintervals are arranged according to the nature of the spot; but where\r\nthe country is level, it is requisite that the trees should be planted\r\nwider apart. Poplars and ashes, too, as they germinate with greater\r\nrapidity, ought to be planted out at an earlier period, or, in other\r\nwords, immediately after the ides of February.[2962] In arranging trees\r\nand shrubs for the support of the vine, the form of the quincunx[2963]\r\nis the one that is generally adopted, and, indeed, is absolutely\r\nnecessary: it not only facilitates the action of the wind, but presents\r\nalso a very pleasing appearance, for whichever way you look at the\r\nplantation, the trees will always present themselves in a straight\r\nline. The same method is employed in propagating the poplar from seed\r\nas the elm, and the mode of transplanting it from the seed-plot is the\r\nsame as that adopted in transplanting it from the forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—THE HOLES FOR TRANSPLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is more particularly necessary in transplanting, that the\r\ntrees should always be removed to a soil that is similar, or else\r\nsuperior,[2964] to the one in which they grew before. If taken from\r\nwarm or early ripening localities, they ought not to be removed to cold\r\nor backward sites, nor yet, on the other hand, from these last to the\r\nformer. If the thing can possibly be done, the holes for transplanting\r\nshould be dug sufficiently long before to admit of their being covered\r\nthroughout with a thick coat of grass. Mago recommends that they should\r\nbe dug a whole year beforehand, in order that they may absorb the heat\r\nof the sun and the moisture of the showers; or, if circumstances do not\r\nadmit of this, that fires should be made in the middle of them some two\r\nmonths before transplanting, that being only done just after rain has\r\nfallen. He says, too, that in an argillaceous[2965] or a hard soil, the\r\nproper measurement is three cubits every way, and on declivitous spots\r\none palm more, care being taken in every case to make the hole like the\r\nchimney of a furnace, narrower at the orifice than at the bottom. Where\r\nthe earth is black, the depth should be two cubits and a palm, and the\r\nhole dug in a quadrangular form.\r\n\r\nThe Greek writers agree in pointing out much the same proportions, and\r\nare of opinion that the holes ought not to be more than two feet and a\r\nhalf in depth, or more than two feet wide: at the same time, too, they\r\nshould never be less than a foot and a half in depth, even though the\r\nsoil should be wet, and the vicinity of water preclude the possibility\r\nof the soil going any deeper. “If the soil is watery,” says Cato,[2966]\r\n“the hole should be three feet in width at the orifice, and one palm\r\nand a foot at the bottom, and the depth four feet. It should be paved,\r\ntoo, with stones,[2967] or, if they are not at hand, with stakes of\r\ngreen willow, or, if these cannot be procured, with a layer of twigs;\r\nthe depth of the layer so made being a foot and a half.”\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that I ought here to add, after what has been said\r\nwith reference to the nature of trees, that the holes should be sunk\r\ndeeper for those which have a tendency to run near the surface of the\r\nearth, such as the ash and the olive, for instance. These trees, in\r\nfact, and others of a similar nature, should be planted at a depth of\r\nfour feet, while for the others three feet will be quite sufficient.\r\n“Cut down that stump,” said Papirius Cursor, the general,[2968] when to\r\nthe great terror of the prætor of Præneste, he had ordered the lictors\r\nto draw[2969] their axes. And, indeed, there is no harm in cutting away\r\nthose portions [of the root] which have become exposed. Some persons\r\nrecommend that a bed should be formed at the bottom, of potsherds or\r\nround pebbles,[2970] which both allow the moisture to pass and retain\r\nas much as is wanted; while at the same time they are of opinion that\r\nflat stones are of no use in such a case, and only prevent the root\r\nfrom penetrating[2971] the earth. To line the bottom with a layer of\r\ngravel would be to follow a middle course between the two opinions.\r\n\r\nSome persons recommend that a tree should not be transplanted before\r\nit is two years old, nor yet after three, while others, again, are of\r\nopinion that if it is one year old it is quite sufficient; Cato[2972]\r\nthinks that it ought to be more than five fingers in thickness at the\r\ntime. The same author, too, would not have omitted, if it had been of\r\nany importance, to recommend that a mark[2973] should be made on the\r\nbark for the purpose of pointing out the southern aspect of the tree;\r\nso that, when transplanted, it may occupy exactly the same position\r\nthat it has previously done; from an apprehension that the north side\r\nof the tree, on finding itself opposite to a southern sun, might split,\r\nand the south side be nipped by the north-eastern blasts. Indeed, there\r\nare some persons who follow a directly opposite practice even in the\r\nvine and the fig,[2974] by placing the north side of the tree, when\r\ntransplanted, towards the south, and vice versâ; being of opinion that\r\nby adopting this plan the foliage becomes all the thicker[2975] and\r\nthe better able to protect the fruit, which is less liable to fall\r\noff in consequence, and that the tree is rendered all the better for\r\nclimbing. Most people, however, take the greatest care to turn to the\r\nsouth that part of the tree from which the branches have been lopped\r\nat the top, little thinking that they expose it thereby to a chance\r\nof splitting[2976] from the excessive heat. For my own part, I should\r\nprefer that this part of the tree should face that point of the heavens\r\nwhich is occupied by the sun at the fifth[2977] or even the eighth\r\nhour of the day. People are also equally unaware that they ought not,\r\nthrough neglect, to let the roots be exposed to the air long enough to\r\nget dry; and that the ground should not be worked about the roots of\r\ntrees while the wind is blowing from the north, or, indeed, from any\r\npoint of the heavens that lies between north and south-east; or, at\r\nall events, that the roots should not be left to lie exposed to these\r\nwinds; the result of such modes of proceeding being, that the trees\r\ndie, the grower being all the while in total ignorance of the cause.\r\n\r\nCato[2978] disapproves, too, of all wind and rain whenever the work of\r\ntransplanting is going on. When this is the case, it will be beneficial\r\nto let as much adhere to the roots as possible of the earth in which\r\nthe tree has grown, and to cover them all round with clods[2979] of\r\nearth: it is for this reason that Cato[2980] recommends that the\r\nyoung trees should be conveyed in baskets, a very desirable method,\r\nno doubt. The same writer, too, approves of the earth that has been\r\ntaken from the surface being laid at the bottom of the hole. Some\r\npersons say,[2981] that if a layer of stones is placed beneath the root\r\nof the pomegranate, the fruit will not split while upon the tree. In\r\ntransplanting, it is the best plan to give the roots a bent position,\r\nbut it is absolutely necessary that the tree should be placed in such\r\na manner as to occupy exactly the centre of the hole. The fig-tree, if\r\nthe slip when planted is stuck in a squill[2982]—such being the name\r\nof a species of bulb—is said to bear with remarkable rapidity, while\r\nthe fruit is exempt from all attacks of the worm: the same precaution,\r\ntoo, in planting, will preserve the fruit of all other trees in a\r\nsimilar manner. Who is there, too, that can entertain a doubt that the\r\nvery greatest care ought to be taken of the roots of the fig-tree when\r\ntransplanted?—indeed, it ought to bear every mark of being taken, and\r\nnot torn, from out of the earth. Upon this subject I omit various other\r\npractical precepts, such, for instance, as the necessity of moulding\r\nup the roots with a rammer, a thing that Cato[2983] looks upon as of\r\nprimary importance; while, at the same time, he recommends that the\r\nwound made in the stock should be first covered with dung, and then\r\nbound with a layer of leaves.[2984]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (12.)—THE INTERVALS TO BE LEFT BETWEEN TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present seems to me to be the proper occasion for making some\r\nmention of the intervals[2985] that ought to be left between the trees.\r\nSome persons have recommended that pomegranates, myrtles, and laurels\r\nshould be planted closer together than the other trees, leaving,\r\nhowever, a space of nine feet between them. Apple-trees, they say,\r\nshould be planted a little wider apart, and pear-trees, almonds, and\r\nfigs even still more so. The best rule, however, is to consult the\r\nlength of the branches, and the nature of the spot, as well as the\r\nshade that is formed by the tree; for it is of great importance to take\r\nthis last into consideration. The shadow thrown by the large trees even\r\nis but of small dimensions, when the branches are disposed around the\r\nbody of the tree in a spherical form, as in the apple and the pear, for\r\ninstance. In the cherry, on the other hand, and the laurel, the shadow\r\nprojected is of enormous extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—THE NATURE OF THE SHADOW THROWN BY TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shadows of trees are possessed of certain properties. That of the\r\nwalnut is baneful[2986] and injurious to man, in whom it is productive\r\nof head-ache, and it is equally noxious to everything that grows in its\r\nvicinity. The shadow, too, of the pine has the effect of killing[2987]\r\nthe grass beneath it; but in both of these trees the foliage presents\r\nan effectual resistance to the winds, while, at the same time, the\r\nvine is destitute of such protection.[2988] The drops of water that\r\nfall from the pine, the quercus, and the holm-oak are extremely heavy,\r\nbut from the cypress none fall; the shadow, too, thrown by this last\r\ntree is extremely small, its foliage being densely packed.[2989] The\r\nshadow of the fig, although widely spread, is but light, for which\r\nreason it is allowed to be planted among vines. The shadow of the\r\nelm is refreshing and even nutrimental to whatever it may happen to\r\ncover; though, in the opinion of Atticus, this tree is one of the most\r\ninjurious of them all; and, indeed, I have no doubt that such may be\r\nthe case when the branches are allowed to become too long; but at the\r\nsame time I am of opinion that when they are kept short it can be\r\nproductive of no possible harm. The plane also gives a very pleasant\r\nshade,[2990] though somewhat dense: but in this case we must look more\r\nto the luxuriant softness of the grass beneath it than the warmth of\r\nthe sun; for there is no tree that forms a more verdant couch on which\r\nto recline.\r\n\r\nThe poplar[2991] gives no shade whatever, in consequence of the\r\nincessant quivering of its leaves: while that of the alder is very\r\ndense, but remarkably nutritive to plants. The vine affords sufficient\r\nshade for its wants, the leaf being always in motion, and from its\r\nrepeated movement tempering the heat of the sun with the shadow that\r\nit affords; at the same time too it serves as an effectual protection\r\nagainst heavy rains. In nearly all trees the shade is thin, where the\r\nfootstalks of the leaves are long.\r\n\r\nThis branch of knowledge is one by no means to be despised or deserving\r\nto be placed in the lowest rank, for in the case of every variety of\r\nplant the shade is found to act either as a kind nurse or a harsh\r\nstep-mother. There is no doubt that the shadow of the walnut, the pine,\r\nthe pitch-tree, and the fir is poisonous to everything it may chance to\r\nlight upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—THE DROPPINGS OF WATER FROM THE LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very few words will suffice for the water that drops from the\r\nleaves of trees. In all those which are protected by a foliage so\r\ndense that the rain will not pass through, the drops are of a noxious\r\nnature.[2992] In our enquiries, therefore, into this subject it will be\r\nof the greatest consequence what will be the nature developed by each\r\ntree in the soil in which we are intending to plant it. Declivities,\r\ntaken by themselves, require smaller[2993] intervals between the trees,\r\nand in localities that are exposed to the wind it is beneficial to\r\nplant them closer together. However, it is the olive that requires\r\nthe largest intervals to be left, and on this point it is the opinion\r\nof Cato,[2994] with reference to Italy, that the very smallest\r\ninterval ought to be twenty-five feet, and the largest thirty: this,\r\nhowever, varies according to the nature of the site. The olive is the\r\nlargest[2995] of all the trees in Bætica: and in Africa—if, indeed,\r\nwe may believe the authors who say so—there are many olive-trees that\r\nare known by the name of milliariæ,[2996] being so called from the\r\nweight of oil that they produce each year. Hence it is that Mago has\r\nprescribed an interval between these trees of no less than seventy-five\r\nfeet every way, or of forty-five at the very lowest, when the soil\r\nhappens to be meagre, hard, and exposed to the winds. There is no\r\ndoubt, however, that Bætica reaps the most prolific harvests from\r\nbetween her olives.\r\n\r\nIt will be generally agreed that it is a most disgraceful piece of\r\nignorance to lop away the branches more than is absolutely necessary in\r\ntrees of vigorous growth, and so precipitate old age; as also, on the\r\nother hand, what is generally tantamount to an avowal of unskilfulness\r\non the part of those who have planted them, to have to cut them down\r\naltogether. Nothing can reflect greater disgrace upon agriculturists\r\nthan to have to undo what they have done, and it is therefore much the\r\nbest to commit an error in leaving a superfluity of room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20. (13.)—TREES WHICH GROW BUT SLOWLY: THOSE WHICH GROW WITH\r\nRAPIDITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome trees are naturally slow in their growth; and those in particular\r\nwhich grow solely from seed[2997] and are long-lived. On the other\r\nhand, those that are short-lived grow with great rapidity, such as the\r\nfig, pomegranate, plum, apple, pear, myrtle, and willow, for instance;\r\nand yet these are the very first to display their productions, for they\r\nbegin to bear at three years old, and make some show of it even before\r\nthat period. The pear is the slowest in bearing of all the trees above\r\nenumerated. The cypirus,[2998] however, and the shrub known as the\r\npseudo-cypirus[2999] are the earliest in coming to maturity, for they\r\nflower almost immediately, and then produce their seed. All trees will\r\ncome to maturity more rapidly when the suckers are removed, and the\r\nnutrimental juices are thrown into the stock only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—TREES PROPAGATED FROM LAYERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature, too, has taught us the art of reproduction from layers. The\r\nbramble, by reason of its thinness and the excessive length to which\r\nit grows, bends downwards, and throws the extremities of its branches\r\ninto the earth; these immediately take root again, and would fill\r\nevery place far and wide, were it not that the arts of cultivation put\r\na check to it; so much so, indeed, that it would almost appear that\r\nmen are born for nothing else but to take care of the earth. Hence it\r\nis, that a thing that is in itself most noxious and most baneful, has\r\ntaught us the art of reproduction by layers and quicksets. The ivy,\r\ntoo, has a similar property.\r\n\r\nCato[3000] says, that in addition to the vine, the fig, as well as the\r\nolive, the pomegranate, every variety of the apple, the laurel, the\r\nplum, the myrtle, the filbert, the nut of Præneste, and the plane, are\r\ncapable of being propagated by layers.\r\n\r\nLayers[3001] are of two kinds; in the one, a branch, while still\r\nadhering to the tree, is pressed downwards into a hole that measures\r\nfour feet every way: at the end of two years it is cut at the part\r\nwhere it curves, and is then transplanted at the expiration of three\r\nyears more. If it is intended to carry the plant to any distance, it\r\nis the best plan to place the layer, directly it is taken up, either\r\nin an osier basket or any earthen vessel, for its better security\r\nwhen carried. The other[3002] mode of reproduction by layers is a\r\nmore costly one, and is effected by summoning forth a root from the\r\ntrunk of the tree even. For this purpose, earthen vessels or baskets\r\nare provided, and are then well packed with earth; through these\r\nthe extremities of the branches are passed, and by this mode of\r\nencouragement a root is obtained growing amid the fruit itself, and at\r\nthe very summit of the tree; for it is at the summit that this method\r\nis generally adopted. In this way has a bold and daring inventiveness\r\nproduced a new tree aloft and far away from the ground. At the end of\r\ntwo years, in the manner already stated, the layer is cut asunder, and\r\nthen planted in the ground, basket and all.\r\n\r\nThe herb savin[3003] is reproduced by layers, as also by slips; it is\r\nsaid, too, that lees of wine or pounded wall-bricks make it thrive\r\nwonderfully well. Rosemary[3004] also is reproduced in a similar\r\nmanner, as also from cuttings of the branches; neither savin nor\r\nrosemary having any seed. The rhododendrum[3005] is propagated by\r\nlayers and from seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (14.)—GRAFTING: THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature has also taught us the art of grafting by means of seed. We\r\nsee a seed swallowed whole by a famished bird; when softened by the\r\nnatural heat of the crop, it is voided, with the fecundating juices of\r\nthe dung, upon some soft couch formed by a tree; or else, as is often\r\nthe case, is carried by the winds to some cleft in the bark of a tree.\r\nHence[3006] it is that we see the cherry growing upon the willow,\r\nthe plane upon the laurel, the laurel upon the cherry, and fruits of\r\nvarious tints and hues all springing from the same tree at once. It\r\nis said, too, that the jack-daw, from its concealment of the seeds\r\nof plants in holes which serve as its store-houses, gives rise to a\r\nsimilar result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—INOCULATION OR BUDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this, too, the art of inoculating[3007] took its rise. By the aid of\r\nan instrument similar to a shoe-maker’s paring-knife an eye is opened\r\nin a tree by paring away the bark, and another bud is then enclosed\r\nin it, that has been previously removed with the same instrument from\r\nanother tree. This was the ancient mode of inoculation with the fig and\r\nthe apple. That again, described by Virgil,[3008] requires a slight\r\nfissure to be made in the knot of a bud which has burst through the\r\nbark, and in this is enclosed a bud taken from another tree. Thus far\r\nhas Nature been our instructor in these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF GRAFTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA different mode of engrafting, however, has been taught us by chance,\r\nanother great instructor, and one from whom, perhaps, we have learnt\r\na still greater number of lessons. A careful husbandman,[3009] being\r\ndesirous, for its better protection, to surround his cottage with a\r\npalisade, thrust the stakes into growing ivy, in order to prevent them\r\nfrom rotting. Seized by the tenacious grasp of the still living ivy,\r\nthe stakes borrowed life from the life of another wood, and it was\r\nfound that the stock of a tree acted in place of earth.\r\n\r\nFor this method of grafting the surface is made level with a saw, and\r\nthe stock carefully smoothed with the pruning-knife. This done, there\r\nare two modes of proceeding, the first of which consists in grafting\r\nbetween the bark and the wood. The ancients were fearful at first of\r\ncutting into the wood, but afterwards they ventured to pierce it to\r\nthe very middle, and inserted the graft in the pith, taking care to\r\nenclose but one, because the pith, they thought, was unable to receive\r\nmore. An improved method has, however, in more recent times, allowed\r\nof as many as six grafts being inserted, it being considered desirable\r\nby additional numbers to make a provision for the contingency of some\r\nof them not surviving. With this view, an incision is carefully made\r\nin the middle of the stock, a thin wedge being inserted to prevent the\r\nsides from closing, until the graft, the end of which is first cut to\r\na point, has been let into the fissure. In doing this many precautions\r\nare necessary, and more particularly every care should be taken that\r\nthe stock is that of a tree suitable for the purpose, and that the\r\ngraft is taken from one that is proper for grafting. The sap,[3010]\r\ntoo, is variously distributed in the several trees, and does not occupy\r\nthe same place in all. In the vine and the fig[3011] the middle of the\r\ntree is the driest, and it is in the summit that the generative power\r\nresides; hence it is, that from the top the grafts are selected. In the\r\nolive, again, the sap lies in the middle of the tree, and the grafts\r\nare accordingly taken from thence: the upper part being comparatively\r\ndry. The graft takes most easily in a tree, the bark of which is of a\r\nsimilar[3012] nature to its own, and which, blossoming at the same time\r\nas itself, has an affinity with it in the development of the natural\r\njuices. On the other hand, the process of uniting is but slow where the\r\ndry is brought in contact with the moist, and the hard bark with the\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\nThe other points to be observed are the following: the incision must\r\nnot be made in a knot, as such an inhospitable rigidity will certainly\r\nrepel the stranger plant; the incision should be made, too, in the part\r\nwhich is most compact, and it must not be much more than three fingers\r\nin length, not in a slanting direction, nor yet such as to pierce the\r\ntree from side to side. Virgil[3013] is of opinion, that the grafts\r\nshould not be taken from the top, and it is universally agreed that\r\nit is best to select them from the shoulders of the tree which look\r\ntowards the north-east;[3014] from a tree, too, that is a good bearer,\r\nand from a young shoot,[3015] unless, indeed, the graft is intended\r\nfor an old tree, in which case it should be of a more robust growth.\r\nIn addition to this, the graft ought to be in a state of impregnation,\r\nthat is to say, swelling[3016] with buds, and giving every promise of\r\nbearing the same year; it ought, too, to be two years old, and not\r\nthinner than the little finger. The graft is inserted at the smaller\r\nend, when it is the object of the grower that it should not grow to\r\nany considerable length, but spread out on either side. But it is more\r\nparticularly necessary that the buds upon the graft should be smooth\r\nand regular, and there must be nothing upon it at all scabbed or\r\nshrivelled. Success may be fully reckoned on if the pith of the graft\r\nis brought in contact with the wood and bark of the stock; that being\r\na much better plan than merely uniting them bark to bark. In pointing\r\nthe graft, the pith ought not to be laid bare; still, however, it\r\nshould be pared with a small knife, so that the point may assume the\r\nform of a fine wedge, not more than three fingers in length, a thing\r\nthat may be very easily effected by first steeping it in water and then\r\nscraping it. The graft, however, must not be pointed while the wind is\r\nblowing, and care must be taken that the bark is not rubbed off from\r\neither graft or stock. The graft must be thrust into the stock up to\r\nthe point where the bark begins; care, too, must be taken not to wrench\r\noff the bark during the process of insertion, nor must it be thrust\r\nback so as to form any folds or wrinkles. It is for this reason that\r\na graft should not be used that is too full of sap, no, by Hercules!\r\nno more than one that is dry and parched; for by doing so, in the\r\nformer case, from the excess of moisture, the bark becomes detached,\r\nand in the latter, from want of vitality, it yields no secretions, and\r\nconsequently will not incorporate with the stock.\r\n\r\nIt is a point most religiously[3017] observed, to insert the graft\r\nduring the moon’s increase, and to be careful to push it down with both\r\nhands; indeed, it is really the fact, that in this operation, the two\r\nhands, acting at the same moment, are of necessity productive of a more\r\nmodified and better regulated effort. Grafts that have been inserted\r\nwith a vigorous effort are later in bearing, but last all the longer;\r\nwhen inserted more tenderly, the contrary is the result. The incision\r\nin the stock should not be too open or too large; nor ought it to be\r\ntoo small, for in such case it would either force out the graft or else\r\nkill it by compression. But the most necessary precaution of all is to\r\nsee that the graft is fairly inserted, and that it occupies exactly the\r\nmiddle of the fissure in the stock.\r\n\r\nSome[3018] persons are in the habit of making the place for the\r\nfissure in the stock with the knife, keeping the edges of the incision\r\ntogether with bands of osier bound tightly round the stock; they then\r\ndrive in the wedges, the bands keeping the stock from opening too\r\nwide. There are some trees that are grafted in the seed-plot and then\r\ntransplanted the very same day. If the stock used for grafting is of\r\nvery considerable thickness, it is the best plan to insert the graft\r\nbetween the bark and the wood; for which purpose a wedge made of bone\r\nis best, for fear lest when the bark is loosened the wood should be\r\nbruised. In the cherry, the bark is removed before the incision in the\r\nstock is made; this, too, is the only tree that is grafted after the\r\nwinter solstice. When the bark is removed, this tree presents a sort of\r\ndowny substance, which, if it happens to adhere to the graft, will very\r\nspeedily destroy it. When once the graft is safely lodged by the aid\r\nof the wedge, it is of advantage to drive it home. It is an excellent\r\nplan, too, to graft as near the ground as possible, if the conformation\r\nof the trunk and knots will admit of it. The graft should not project\r\nfrom the stock more than six fingers in length.\r\n\r\nCato[3019] recommends a mixture of argil[3020] or powdered chalk, and\r\ncow-dung, to be stirred together till it is of a viscous consistency,\r\nand then inserted in the fissure and rubbed all round it. From his\r\nwritings on the subject it is very evident that at that period it was\r\nthe practice to engraft only between the wood and the bark, and in no\r\nother way; and that the graft was never inserted beyond a couple of\r\nfingers in depth.[3021] He recommends, too, that the pear and the apple\r\nshould be grafted in spring, as also during fifty days at the time\r\nof the summer solstice, and during the time of vintage; but that the\r\nolive and the fig should be grafted in spring only, in a thirsting, or\r\nin other words, a dry moon: he says also, that it should be done in\r\nthe afternoon, and not while a south wind is blowing. It is a singular\r\nthing, that, not content with protecting the graft in the manner\r\nalready mentioned, and with sheltering it from showers and frosts by\r\nmeans of turfs and supple bands of split osiers, he recommends that\r\nit should be covered with bugloss[3022] as well—a kind of herb so\r\ncalled—which is to be tied over it and then covered up with straw. At\r\nthe present day, however, it is thought sufficient to cover the bark\r\nwith a mixture of mud and chaff, allowing the graft to protrude a\r\ncouple of fingers in length.\r\n\r\nThose who wait for spring to carry on these operations, will find\r\nthemselves pressed for time; for the buds are then just bursting,\r\nexcept, indeed, in the case of the olive, the buds of which are\r\nremarkably long in developing themselves, the tree itself having\r\nextremely little sap beneath the bark; this, too, is apt, when in too\r\nlarge quantities, to injure the grafts. As to the pomegranate, too,\r\nthe fig, and the rest of the trees that are of a dry nature, it is far\r\nfrom beneficial to them to put off the process of grafting till a late\r\nperiod. The pear may be grafted even when in blossom, so that with it\r\nthe operation may be safely delayed to the month of May even. If grafts\r\nof fruit trees have to be carried to any distance, it is considered the\r\nbest plan, with the view of preserving the juices, to insert them in a\r\nturnip; they may also be kept alive by placing them near a stream or a\r\npond, between two hollow tiles covered up at each end with earth. (15.)\r\nThe grafts of vines, however, are kept in dry holes, in which they are\r\ncovered over with straw, and then with earth, care being taken to let\r\nthe tops protrude.[3023]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—GRAFTING THE VINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCato[3024] speaks of three[3025] methods of grafting the vine. The\r\nfirst consists in piercing the stock to the pith, and then inserting\r\nthe grafts, sharpened at the end, in manner already mentioned, care\r\nbeing taken to bring the pith of the two in contact. The second is\r\nadopted in case the two vines are near one another, the sides of them\r\nboth being cut in a slanting direction where they face each other;\r\nafter which the pith of the two trees is united by tying them together.\r\nIn employing the third method, the vine is pierced obliquely to the\r\npith, and grafts are inserted a couple of feet in length; they are then\r\ntied down and covered over with prepared earth, care being taken to\r\nkeep them in an upright position. In our time, however, this method\r\nhas been greatly improved by making use of the Gallic auger,[3026]\r\nwhich pierces the tree without scorching it; it being the fact, that\r\neverything that burns the tree weakens its powers. Care, too, is taken\r\nto select a graft that is just beginning to germinate, and not to leave\r\nmore than a couple of the buds protruding from the stock. The vine,\r\ntoo, should be carefully bound with withes of elm, incisions being made\r\nin it on either side, in order that the slimy juices may exude through\r\nthem in preference, which are so particularly injurious to the vine.\r\nAfter this, when the graft has grown a couple of feet, the withe by\r\nwhich it is fastened should be cut, and the graft left to increase of\r\nits own natural vigour.\r\n\r\nThe proper time[3027] for grafting the vine has been fixed as from the\r\nautumnal equinox to the beginning of the budding season. The cultivated\r\nplants are generally grafted on the roots of wild ones, where these\r\nlast are of a drier nature. But if a cultivated tree should be grafted\r\non a wild one, it will very soon degenerate and become wild.[3028]\r\nThe rest depends entirely on the weather. Dry weather is the best\r\nsuited for grafting; an excellent remedy for any evil effects that may\r\npossibly be caused by the drought, being a few pots of earth placed\r\nnear the stock and filled with ashes; through which a little water is\r\nslowly filtered. Light dews are extremely favourable to grafting by\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26. (16)—GRAFTING BY SCUTCHEONS.[3029]\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting by scutcheons would appear to owe its origin to that by\r\ninoculation; but it is suited more particularly to a thick bark,\r\nsuch as that of the fig-tree for instance. For this purpose, all the\r\nbranches are cut off, in order that they may not divert the sap,\r\nafter which the smoothest part is selected in the stock, and a\r\nscutcheon[3030] of the bark removed, due care being taken that the\r\nknife does not go below it. A similar piece of bark from another tree,\r\nwith a protuberant bud upon it, is then inserted in its place, care\r\nbeing taken that the union is so exact that there is no room left for\r\na cicatrix to form, and the juncture so perfect as to leave no access\r\nto either damp or air: still, however, it is always the best plan to\r\nprotect the scutcheon by means of a plaster of clay and a band. Those\r\nwho favour the modern fashions pretend that this method has been only\r\ndiscovered in recent times; but the fact is, that we find it employed\r\nby the ancient Greeks, and described by Cato,[3031] who recommends it\r\nfor the olive and the fig; and he goes so far as to determine the very\r\ndimensions even, in accordance with his usual exactness. The scutcheon,\r\nhe says, when taken off with the knife should be four[3032] fingers\r\nin length, and three in breadth. It is then fitted to the spot which\r\nit is to occupy, and anointed with the mixture of his which has been\r\npreviously described.[3033] This method, too, he recommends for the\r\napple.\r\n\r\nSome persons have adopted another plan with the vine, which consists\r\npartly of that of grafting by scutcheon, and partly by fissure; they\r\nfirst remove a square piece of bark from the stock, and then insert a\r\nslip in the place that is thus laid bare. I once saw at Thuliæ,[3034]\r\nnear Tibur, a tree that had been grafted[3035] upon all these various\r\nways, and loaded with fruit of every kind. Upon one branch there\r\nwere nuts to be seen, upon another berries, upon another grapes,\r\nupon another pears, upon another figs, and upon others pomegranates,\r\nand several varieties of the apple; the tree, however, was but very\r\nshort-lived. But, with all our experiments, we find it quite impossible\r\nto rival Nature; for there are some plants that can be reproduced in\r\nno other manner than spontaneously, and then only in wild and desert\r\nspots. The plane[3036] is generally considered the best adapted to\r\nreceive every kind of graft, and next to it the robur; both of them,\r\nhowever, are very apt to spoil the flavour of the fruit. Some trees\r\nadmit of grafting upon them in any fashion, the fig and the pomegranate\r\nfor instance; the vine, however, cannot be grafted upon by scutcheon,\r\nnor, indeed, any other of the trees which has a bark that is thin,\r\nweak, or cracked. So, too, those trees which are dry, or which contain\r\nbut little moisture, will not admit of grafting by inoculation. This\r\nlast method is the most prolific of them all, and next to it that by\r\nscutcheon, but neither of them can be depended upon, and this last more\r\nparticularly; for when the adherence of the bark is the only point\r\nof union the scutcheon is liable to be immediately displaced by the\r\nslightest gust of wind. Grafting by insertion is the most reliable\r\nmethod, and the tree so produced will bear more fruit than one that is\r\nmerely planted.\r\n\r\n(17.) We must not here omit one very singular circumstance. Corellius,\r\na member of the Equestrian order at Rome, and a native of Ateste,\r\ngrafted a chesnut, in the territory of Neapolis, with a slip taken\r\nfrom the same tree, and from this was produced the chesnut which is so\r\nhighly esteemed, and from him has derived its name. At a later period\r\nagain, Etereius, his freedman, grafted the Corellian[3037] chesnut\r\nafresh. There is this difference between the two; the Corellian is more\r\nprolific, but the Etereian is of superior quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—PLANTS WHICH GROW FROM A BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is accident that has the credit of devising the other methods of\r\nreproduction, and has taught us how to break off a branch of a tree\r\nand plant it in the earth, from seeing stakes, when driven in the\r\nearth, take root, and grow. It is in this way that many of the trees\r\nare reproduced, and the fig more particularly; which may be propagated\r\nalso by all the methods previously stated, with the exception, indeed,\r\nof that by cuttings. The best plan, however, is to take a pretty\r\nlarge branch, and, after sharpening it like a stake,[3038] to drive\r\nit to a considerable depth in the earth, taking care to leave only a\r\nsmall portion above ground, and then to cover it over with sand. The\r\npomegranate, too, may be planted in a similar manner, the hole being\r\nfirst widened with a stake; the same, too, with the myrtle. For all\r\ntrees of this nature a branch is required three feet in length, and not\r\nquite the thickness of the arm, care being taken to keep the bark on,\r\nand to sharpen the branch to a point at the lower end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—TREES WHICH GROW FROM CUTTINGS; THE MODE OF PLANTING THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe myrtle, too, may be propagated from cuttings, and the mulberry\r\nis grown no other way, the religious observances relative to\r\nlightning[3039] forbidding it to be grafted on the elm;[3040] hence it\r\nwould appear that the present is a fitting opportunity for speaking of\r\nreproduction from cuttings. Care should be taken more particularly to\r\nselect the slips from fruitful trees, and it should be seen that they\r\nare neither bent, scabbed, nor bifurcated. The cuttings, too, should\r\nbe thick enough to fill the hand, and not less than a foot in length:\r\nthe bark, too, should be uninjured, and the end which is cut and lies\r\nnearest the root should always be the one inserted in the earth. While\r\nthe work of germination is going on, the slip should be kept well\r\nmoulded up, until such time as it has fully taken root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29. (18.)—THE CULTIVATION OF THE OLIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCato[3041] has treated so well of the precautions that are necessary\r\nin cultivating the olive, that we cannot do better than employ his\r\nown words on the subject. “Let the slips of olive,” says he, “which\r\nyou are about to plant in the hole, be three feet long, and be very\r\ncareful in your treatment of them, so as not to injure the bark when\r\nyou are smoothing or cutting them. Those that you are going to plant\r\nin the nursery, should be a foot in length; and you should plant them\r\nthe following way: let the spot be turned up with the mattock, and the\r\nsoil be well loosened. When you put the cutting in the ground, press\r\nit down with the foot only. If there is any difficulty in making it\r\ndescend, drive it down with a mallet or the handle of the dibble, but\r\nbe careful not to break the bark in doing so. Take care, too, not to\r\nmake a hole first with the dibble, for the slip will have the better\r\nchance of surviving the other way. When the slip is three years old,\r\ndue care must be taken to observe the direction in which each side of\r\nthe bark is situate. If you are planting in holes or furrows, you must\r\nput in the cuttings by threes, but be careful to keep them separate.\r\nAbove ground, however, they should not be more than four fingers\r\ndistant from one another, and each of them must have a bud or eye above\r\nground. In taking up the olive for transplanting, you must use the\r\ngreatest caution, and see that there is as much earth left about the\r\nroots as possible. When you have covered the roots well up, tread down\r\nthe earth with the foot, so that nothing may injure the plant.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—TRANSPLANTING OPERATIONS AS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE\r\nVARIOUS SEASONS OF THE YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the enquiry is made what is the proper season for planting the\r\nolive, my answer will be, “where the soil is dry, at seed-time; where\r\nit is rich, in spring.” The following is the advice given by Cato[3042]\r\non the subject: “Begin pruning your olive-yard fifteen days before the\r\nvernal equinox; from that period for forty days will be a good time for\r\ndoing so. In pruning, adopt the following rules: when the ground is\r\nextremely productive, remove all the dry branches or such as may have\r\nbeen broken by the wind; where it is not so prolific, you must cut away\r\nstill more, then tie them well up, and remove all tangled branches, so\r\nas to lighten the roots. In autumn clear away the roots of the olive,\r\nand then manure them. The man who labours most assiduously and most\r\nearnestly will remove the very smallest fibres that are attached to the\r\nroots. If, however, he hoes negligently, the roots will soon appear\r\nagain above ground, and become thicker than ever; the consequence of\r\nwhich will be, that the vigour of the tree will be expended in the\r\nroots.”\r\n\r\nWe have already stated, when speaking on the subject of oil,[3043]\r\nwhat are the different varieties of the olive, in what kind of soil it\r\nought to be planted, and what is the proper aspect for the olive-yard.\r\nMago recommends that the olive should be planted on declivities and\r\nin dry spots, in an argillaceous soil, and between autumn and the\r\nwinter equinox. If, on the other hand, the soil is thick, humid, or\r\nsomewhat damp even, it ought to be planted between harvest and the\r\nwinter solstice; advice, however, it should be remembered, applicable\r\nto Africa more particularly. At the present day, it is mostly the\r\ncustom in Italy to plant the olive in spring, but if it is thought\r\ndesirable to do so in the autumn as well, there are only four days in\r\nthe forty between the equinox and the setting of the Vergiliæ that\r\nare unfavourable for planting it.[3044] It is a practice peculiar to\r\nAfrica, to engraft the olive on the wild olive only, a tree which is\r\nmade to be everlasting, as it were; for when it becomes old the best\r\nof the suckers are carefully trained for adoption by grafting, and in\r\nthis way in another tree it grows young again; an operation which may\r\nbe repeated continuously as often as needed; so much so, indeed, that\r\nthe same olive-yard will last for ages.[3045] The wild olive also is\r\npropagated both by insertion and inoculation.\r\n\r\nIt is not advisable to plant the olive in a site where the quercus\r\nhas been lately rooted up; for the earth-worms, known as “raucæ,”\r\nwhich breed in the root of the quercus, are apt to get into that of\r\nthe olive. It has been found, from practical experience, that it is\r\nnot advisable to bury the cuttings in the ground nor yet to dry them\r\nbefore they are planted out. Experience has also taught us that it is\r\nthe best plan to clean an old olive-yard every other year, between the\r\nvernal equinox and the rising of the Vergiliæ, and to lay moss about\r\nthe roots; to dig holes also round the trees every year, just after the\r\nsummer solstice, two cubits wide by a foot in depth, and to manure them\r\nevery third year.\r\n\r\nMago, too, recommends that the almond should be planted between the\r\nsetting of Arcturus[3046] and the winter solstice. All the varieties,\r\nhowever, of the pear, he says, should not be planted at the same time,\r\nas they do not all blossom together. Those with oblong or round fruit\r\nshould be planted between the setting of the Vergiliæ and the winter\r\nsolstice, and the other kinds in the middle of the winter, after the\r\nsetting of the constellation of the Arrow,[3047] on a site that looks\r\ntowards the east or north. The laurel should be planted between the\r\nsetting of the Eagle and that of the Arrow; for we find that the\r\nproper time for planting is equally connected with the aspect of the\r\nheavenly bodies. For the most part it has been recommended that this\r\nshould be done in spring and autumn; but there is another appropriate\r\nperiod also, though known to but few, about the rising of the Dog-star,\r\nnamely; it is not, however, equally advantageous in all localities.\r\nStill, I ought not to omit making mention of it, as I am not setting\r\nforth the peculiar advantages of any one country in particular, but am\r\nenquiring into the operations of Nature taken as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn the region of Cyrenaica, the planting is generally done while the\r\nEtesian[3048] winds prevail, and the same is the case in Greece, and\r\nwith the olive more particularly in Laconia. At this period, also, the\r\nvine is planted in the island of Cos; and in the rest of Greece they\r\ndo not neglect to inoculate and graft, though they do not[3049] plant,\r\ntheir trees just then. The natural qualities, too, of the respective\r\nlocalities, exercise a very considerable influence in this respect; for\r\nin Egypt they plant in any month, as also in all other countries where\r\nsummer rains do not prevail, India and Æthiopia, for instance. When\r\ntrees are not planted in the spring they must be planted in autumn, as\r\na matter of course.\r\n\r\nThere are three stated periods, then, for germination;[3050] spring,\r\nthe rising of the Dog-star, and that of Arcturus. And, indeed, it is\r\nnot the animated beings only that are ardent for the propagation of\r\ntheir species, for this desire is manifested in even a greater degree\r\nby the earth and all its vegetable productions; to employ this tendency\r\nat the proper moment is the most advantageous method of ensuring an\r\nabundant increase. These moments, too, are of peculiar importance\r\nin relation to the process of grafting, as it is then that the two\r\nproductions manifest a mutual desire of uniting. Those who prefer the\r\nspring for grafting commence operations immediately after the vernal\r\nequinox, reckoning on the fact that then the buds are just coming out,\r\na thing that greatly facilitates the union of the barks. On the other\r\nhand, those who prefer the autumn graft immediately after the rising\r\nof Arcturus, because then the graft at once takes root in some degree,\r\nand becomes seasoned for spring, so as not to exhaust its strength all\r\nat once in the process of germination. However, there are certain fixed\r\nperiods of the year, in all cases, for certain trees; thus, the cherry,\r\nfor instance, and the almond, are either planted or grafted about the\r\nwinter solstice. For many trees the nature of the locality will be the\r\nbest guide; thus, where the soil is cold and moist it is best to plant\r\nin spring, and where it is dry and hot, in autumn.\r\n\r\nTaking Italy in general, the proper periods for these operations may be\r\nthus distributed:—The mulberry is planted at any time between the ides\r\nof February[3051] and the vernal equinox; the pear, in the autumn, but\r\nnot beyond the fifteenth day before the winter solstice; the summer\r\napples, the quince, the sorb, and the plum, between mid-winter and the\r\nides of February; the Greek carob[3052] and the peach, at any time\r\nin autumn before the winter solstice; the various nuts, such as the\r\nwalnut, pine, filbert, almond, and chesnut, between the calends of\r\nMarch[3053] and the ides of that month;[3054] the willow and the broom\r\nabout the calends of March. The broom is grown from seed, and in a dry\r\nsoil, the willow from plants, in a damp locality, as already stated on\r\nformer occasions.[3055]\r\n\r\n(19.) That I may omit nothing to my knowledge of the facts that I have\r\nanywhere been able to ascertain, I shall here add a new method of\r\ngrafting, which has been discovered by Columella,[3056] as he asserts,\r\nby the aid of which trees even of a heterogeneous or dissociable nature\r\nmay be made to unite; such, for instance, as the fig and the olive.\r\nIn accordance with this plan, he recommends that a fig-tree should be\r\nplanted near an olive, at a distance sufficiently near to admit of the\r\nfig being touched by a branch of the olive when extended to its full\r\nlength; as supple and pliant a one as possible being selected for the\r\npurpose, and due care being taken all the time to render it seasoned\r\nby keeping it constantly on the stretch. After this, when the fig has\r\ngained sufficient vigour, a thing that generally happens at the end\r\nof three or five years at most, the top of it is cut off, the end\r\nof the olive branch being also cut to a point in the manner already\r\nstated.[3057] This point is then to be inserted in the trunk of the\r\nfig, and made secure with cords, lest, being bent, it should happen\r\nto rebound: in this way we find the method of propagating by layers\r\ncombined with that of grafting. This union between the two parent trees\r\nis allowed to continue for three years, and then in the fourth the\r\nbranch is cut away and left entirely upon the tree that has so adopted\r\nit. This method, however, is not at present universally known, at all\r\nevents, so far as I have been able to ascertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—CLEANING AND BARING THE ROOTS, AND MOULDING THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to these particulars, the same considerations that I have\r\nalready[3058] mentioned in reference to warm or cold, moist or dry\r\nsoils, have also taught us the necessity of trenching around the roots.\r\nThese trenches, however, in a moist, watery soil, should be neither\r\nwide nor deep; while the contrary is the case where the ground is hot\r\nand dry; it being the object, in the latter instance, to let them\r\nreceive and retain as much water as possible. This rule is applicable\r\nto the culture of old trees as well; for in very hot places the roots\r\nare well moulded in summer, and carefully covered up, to prevent the\r\nheat of the sun from parching them. In other places, again, the ground\r\nis cleared away from the roots, in order to give free access to the\r\nair, while in winter they are carefully moulded to protect them from\r\nthe frost. The contrary is the case, however, in hot climates, for\r\nthere they bare the roots in winter for the purpose of ensuring a\r\nsupply of moisture to the parched fibres.\r\n\r\nIn all places the rule is to make a circular trench three feet in width\r\nat the foot of the tree; this, however, it is not possible to do in\r\nmeadows, where the roots, in their fondness for the sun and showers,\r\nrange near the surface far and wide. Such, then, are the general\r\nobservations that we have to make in reference to the planting and\r\ngrafting of trees that we value for their fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (20.)—WILLOW-BEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now remains to give an account of those trees which are planted for\r\nthe sake of others—the vine[3059] more particularly—and the wood of\r\nwhich is cut from time to time. Holding the very first rank among these\r\nwe find the willow, a tree that is always planted in a moist soil. The\r\nhole, however, should be two feet and a half in depth, and the slip a\r\nfoot and a half only in length. Willow stakes are also used for the\r\nsame purpose, and the stouter they are the better: the distance left\r\nbetween these last should be six feet. When they are three years old\r\ntheir growth is checked by cutting them down within a couple of feet\r\nfrom the ground, the object being to make them spread out, so that by\r\nthe aid of their branches they may be cleared without the necessity\r\nof using a ladder; for the willow is the more productive the nearer\r\nits branches are to the ground. It is generally recommended to trench\r\nround the willow every year, in the month of April. Such is the mode of\r\ncultivation employed for the osier willow.[3060]\r\n\r\nThe stake willow[3061] is reproduced both from suckers and cuttings,\r\nin a trench of the same dimensions. Stakes may be cut from it at the\r\nend of about three years mostly. These stakes are also used to supply\r\nthe place of the trees as they grow old, being fixed in the ground as\r\nlayers, and cut away from the trunk at the end of a year. A single\r\njugerum of osier willows will supply osiers[3062] sufficient for\r\ntwenty-five jugera of vines. It is for a similar purpose that the white\r\npoplar[3063] is grown; the trenches being two feet deep and the cutting\r\na foot and a half in length. It is left to dry for a couple of days\r\nbefore it is planted, and a space is left between the plants a foot and\r\na palm in width, after which they are covered with earth to the depth\r\nof a couple of cubits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—REED-BEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reed[3064] requires a soil still moister even than that employed\r\nfor the willow. It is planted by placing the bulb of the root, that\r\npart which some people call the “eye,”[3065] in a trench three quarters\r\nof a foot in depth, at intervals of two feet and a half. A reed-bed\r\nwill renew itself spontaneously after the old one has been rooted up, a\r\ncircumstance which it has been found more beneficial to take advantage\r\nof than merely to thin them, as was formerly the practice; the roots\r\nbeing in the habit of creeping and becoming interlaced, a thing that\r\nends eventually in the destruction of the bed. The proper time for\r\nplanting reeds is before the eyes begin to swell, or, in other words,\r\nbefore the calends of March.[3066] The reed continues to increase until\r\nthe winter solstice, but ceases to do so when it begins to grow hard, a\r\nsign that it is fit for cutting. It is generally thought, too, that the\r\nreed requires to be trenched round as often as the vine.\r\n\r\nThe reed also is planted in a horizontal position,[3067] and then\r\ncovered with earth to a very great depth; by this method as many plants\r\nspring up as there are eyes. It is propagated, also, by planting out in\r\ntrenches a foot in depth, care being taken to cover up two of the eyes,\r\nwhile a third knot is left just on a level with the ground; the head,\r\ntoo, is bent downwards, that it may not become charged with dew. The\r\nreed is usually cut when the moon is on the wane.[3068] When required\r\nfor the vineyard, it is better dried for a year than used in a green\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—OTHER PLANTS THAT ARE CUT FOR POLES AND STAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chesnut is found to produce better stays[3069] for the vine than\r\nany other tree, both from the facility with which they are worked,\r\ntheir extremely lasting qualities, and the circumstance that, when\r\ncut, the tree will bud again more speedily than the willow[3070] even.\r\nIt requires a soil that is light without being gravelly, a moist,\r\nsandy one more particularly, or else a charcoal earth,[3071] or a fine\r\ntufa[3072] even; while at the same time a northern aspect, however cold\r\nand shady, and if upon a declivity even, greatly promotes its growth.\r\nIt refuses to grow, however, in a gravelly soil, or in red earth,\r\nchalk, or, indeed, any kind of fertilizing ground. We have already\r\nstated,[3073] that it is reproduced from the nut, but it will only grow\r\nfrom those of the largest size, and then only when they are sown in\r\nheaps of five together. The ground above the nuts should be kept broken\r\nfrom the month of November to February, as it is at that period that\r\nthe nuts lose their hold and fall of themselves from the tree, and then\r\ntake root. There ought to be intervals of a foot in width left between\r\nthem,[3074] and the hole in which they are planted should be nine\r\ninches every way. At the end of two years or more they are transplanted\r\nfrom this seed plot into another, where they are laid out at intervals\r\nof a couple of feet.\r\n\r\nLayers are also employed for the reproduction of this tree, and there\r\nis none to which they are better[3075] adapted: the root of the plant\r\nis left exposed, and the layer is placed in the trench at full length,\r\nwith the summit also protruding from the earth; the result being,\r\nthat it shoots from the top as well as the root. When transplanted,\r\nhowever, it is very hard to be reconciled, as it stands in dread of all\r\nchange. Hence it is, that it is nearly two years before it will begin\r\nto shoot upward; from which circumstance it is generally preferred\r\nto rear the slips in the nursery from the nut itself, to obtaining\r\nthem from quicksets. The mode of cultivation does not differ from\r\nthat employed with the plants already mentioned.[3076] It is trenched\r\naround, and carefully lopped for two successive years; after which it\r\nis able to take care of itself, the shade it gives sufficing to stifle\r\nall superfluous suckers: before the end of the sixth year it is fit for\r\ncutting.\r\n\r\nA single jugerum of chesnuts will provide stays for twenty jugera of\r\nvineyard, and the branches that are taken from near the roots afford a\r\nsupply of two-forked uprights; they will last, too, till after the next\r\ncutting of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe æsculus,[3077] too, is grown in a similar manner, the time for\r\ncutting being three years at the latest. Being less difficult, too, to\r\npropagate, it may be planted in any kind of earth, the acorn—and it is\r\nonly with the æsculus that this is done—being sown in spring, in a hole\r\nnine inches in depth, with intervals between the plants of two feet\r\nin width. This tree is lightly hoed, four times a year. This kind of\r\nstay is the least likely to rot of them all; and the more the tree is\r\ncut, the more abundantly it shoots. In addition to the above, they also\r\ngrow other trees for cutting that we have already mentioned—the ash for\r\ninstance, the laurel, the peach, the hazel, and the apple; but then\r\nthey are of slower growth, and the stays made from them, when fixed in\r\nthe ground, are hardly able to withstand the action of the earth, and\r\nmuch less any moisture. The elder, on the other hand, which affords\r\nstakes of the very stoutest quality, is grown from cuttings, like the\r\npoplar. As to the cypress, we have already spoken of it at sufficient\r\nlength.[3078]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35. (21.)—THE CULTURE OF THE VINE AND THE VARIOUS SHRUBS WHICH\r\nSUPPORT IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now described what we may call the armoury[3079] of the vine,\r\nit remains for us to treat with a particular degree of care of the\r\nnature of the vine itself.\r\n\r\nThe shoots of the vine, as also of certain other trees, the interior of\r\nwhich is naturally of a spongy quality, have certain knots or joints\r\nupon the stem that intercept the pith. The intervals between these\r\njoints in the branches are short, and more particularly so towards the\r\nextremities. The pith, in itself the vivifying spirit of the tree,\r\nis always taking an onward direction, so long as the knot, by being\r\nopen in the centre, allows it a free passage. If, however, the knot\r\nshould become solidified and deny it a passage, the pith is then thrown\r\ndownward upon the knot that lies next below it, and making its escape,\r\nissues forth there in the shape of a bud, these buds always making\r\ntheir appearance on each side alternately, as already mentioned in the\r\ncase of the reed and the giant-fennel;[3080] in other words, where one\r\nbud makes its appearance at the bottom of a knot to the right, the next\r\none takes its place on the left, and so on alternately. In the vine\r\nthis bud is known as the “gem,”[3081] as soon as the pith has formed\r\nthere a small round knob; but before it has done this, the concavity\r\nthat is left upon the surface is merely called the “eye:”[3082] when\r\nsituate at the extremity of the shoot, it is known as the “germ.”[3083]\r\nIt is in the same way, too, that the stock branches, suckers, grapes,\r\nleaves, and tendrils of the vine are developed: and it is a very\r\nsurprising fact, that all that grows on the right[3084] side of the\r\ntree is stronger and stouter than on the left.\r\n\r\nHence it is, that when slips of this tree are planted, it is necessary\r\nto cut these knots in the middle, in order to prevent the pith from\r\nmaking its escape. In the same way, too, when planting the fig, suckers\r\nare taken, nine inches in length, and after the ground is opened they\r\nare planted with the part downwards that grew nearest to the tree, and\r\nwith a couple of eyes protruding from the earth—in slips of trees, that\r\npart is properly called the eye which is to give birth to the future\r\nbud. It is for this reason that, in the seed-plots even the slips that\r\nare thus planted sometimes bear the same year the fruit that they would\r\nhave borne if they had remained upon the tree: this takes place when\r\nthey have been planted in good seasons and are replete with fecundity,\r\nfor then they bring to maturity the fruits the conception of which was\r\ncommenced in another spot. Fig-trees that are thus planted may very\r\neasily be transplanted in the third year. As some compensation for the\r\nrapidity with which this tree becomes[3085] old, it has thus received\r\nthe privilege of coming to maturity[3086] at a very early period.\r\n\r\nThe vine throws out a great number of shoots. In the first place,\r\nhowever, none of them are ever used for planting, except those which\r\nare useless, and would have been cut away as mere brushwood; while,\r\non the other hand, every part is pruned off that has borne fruit the\r\nprevious year. In former times, it was the custom to plant the slip\r\nwith a head at the extremity, consisting of a piece of the hard wood on\r\neach side of it, the same, in fact, that is called a mallet shoot[3087]\r\nat the present day. In more recent times, however, the practice has\r\nbeen adopted of pulling it off merely with a heel attached to it, as\r\nin the fig;[3088] and there is no kind of slip that takes with greater\r\ncertainty. A third method, again, has been added to the former ones,\r\nand a more simple one as well, that of taking the slip without any\r\nheel at all. These slips are known by the name of arrow-[3089]shoots,\r\nwhen they are twisted before planting; and the same, when they are\r\nneither cut short nor twisted, are called three-budded[3090] slips.\r\nThe same sucker very often furnishes several slips of this kind. To\r\nplant a stock-shoot[3091] of the vine is unproductive, and, indeed,\r\nno shoots will bear unless they are taken from a part that has borne\r\nfruit already. A slip that has but few knots upon it, is looked upon\r\nas likely not to bear; while a great number of buds is considered an\r\nindication of fruitfulness. Some persons say that no suckers ought to\r\nbe planted, but those which have already blossomed. It is far from\r\nadvantageous[3092] to plant arrow-slips, for after being twisted,\r\nthey are apt to break in transplanting. The slips when planted should\r\nbe a foot in length,[3093] and not less, and they ought to have five\r\nor six knots upon them; with the dimensions above stated, they cannot,\r\nhowever, possibly have less than three buds. It is considered the most\r\nadvantageous plan to plant them out the same day that they are cut; but\r\nif it is found necessary to plant them some time after, they should be\r\nkept in the way that we have already mentioned;[3094] particular care\r\nbeing taken not to let them protrude from the earth, lest they should\r\nbecome dried by the action of the sun, or nipped by the wind or frost.\r\nWhen they have been kept too long in a dry place, they must be put in\r\nwater for several days, for the purpose of restoring their verdancy and\r\nfreshness.\r\n\r\nThe spot selected, whether for nursery or vineyard, ought to be\r\nexposed to the sun, and of as great extent as possible; the soil being\r\nturned up to a depth of three feet with a two-pronged fork. The earth,\r\non being thrown up with the mattock,[3095] swells naturally,[3096]\r\nand ridges are formed with it four feet in height, intersected by\r\ntrenches a couple[3097] of feet in depth. The earth in the trenches\r\nis carefully cleansed and raked out,[3098] so that none of it may be\r\nleft unbroken, care being taken also to keep it exactly level; if the\r\nridges are unequal, it shows that the ground has been badly dug. At\r\nthe same time the breadth should be measured of each ridge that lies\r\nbetween the trenches. The slips are planted either in holes or else in\r\nelongated furrows, and then covered with very fine earth; but where it\r\nis a light soil, the grower will lose his pains should he neglect to\r\nplace a layer of richer mould beneath. Not less than a couple of slips\r\nshould be planted together, keeping them exactly on a level with the\r\nadjoining earth, which should be pressed down and made compact with the\r\ndibble. In the seed-plot there should be intervals left between each\r\ntwo settings a foot and a half in breadth and half a foot in length:\r\nwhen thus planted, it is usual, at the end of two years, to cut the\r\nmallet-shoots at the knot nearest the ground, unless there is some\r\ngood reason for sparing them. When this is done, they throw out eyes,\r\nand with these upon them at the end of three years the quicksets are\r\ntransplanted.\r\n\r\nThere is another method, also, of planting[3099] the vine, which\r\na luxurious refinement in these matters has introduced. Four\r\nmallet-shoots are tightly fastened together with a cord in the greenest\r\npart, and when thus arranged are passed through the shank-bone of an\r\nox or else a tube of baked earth, after which they are planted in the\r\nground, care being taken to leave a couple of buds protruding: in this\r\nway they become impregnated with moisture, and, immediately on being\r\ncut, throw out fresh wood. The tube is then broken, upon which the\r\nroot, thus set at liberty, assumes fresh vigour, and the clusters[3100]\r\nultimately bear upon them grapes belonging to the four kinds thus\r\nplanted together.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a more recent discovery, another method has been\r\nadopted. A mallet-shoot is split down the middle and the pith\r\nextracted, after which the two portions are fastened together, every\r\ncare being taken not to injure the buds. The mallet-shoot is then\r\nplanted in a mixture of earth and manure, and when it begins to throw\r\nout branches it is cut, the ground being repeatedly dug about it.\r\nColumella[3101] assures us that the grapes of this plant will have no\r\nstones, but it is a more surprising thing that the slip itself should\r\nsurvive when thus deprived of the pith.[3102] Still, however, I think I\r\nought not to omit the fact that there are some slips that grow without\r\nthe ordinary articulations of trees upon them; thus, for instance, five\r\nor six very small sprigs of box,[3103] if tied together and put in the\r\nground, will take root. It was formerly made a point to take these\r\nsprigs from a box-tree that had not been lopped, as it was fancied that\r\nin the last case they would not live; experience, however, has since\r\nput an end to that notion.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the vineyard naturally follows the training of the\r\nnursery. There are five[3104] different kinds of vine: that with\r\nthe branches running[3105] along the ground, the vine that stands\r\nwithout support,[3106] the vine that is propped and requires\r\nno cross-piece,[3107] the vine that is propped and requires a\r\nsingle cross-piece, and the vine that requires a trellis of four\r\ncompartments.[3108] The mode of cultivation requisite for the propped\r\nvine may be understood as equally adapted to the one that stands by\r\nitself and requires no support, for this last method is only employed\r\nwhere there is a scarcity of wood for stays. The stay with the single\r\ncross-piece in a straight line is known by the name of “canterius.” It\r\nis the best of all for the wine, for then the tree throws no shadow,\r\nand the grape is ripened continuously by the sun, while, at the same\r\ntime, it derives more advantage from the action of the wind, and\r\ndisengages the dew with greater facility: the superfluous leaves and\r\nshoots, too, are more easily removed, and the breaking up of the earth\r\nand other operations about the tree are effected with greater facility.\r\nBut, above all, by the adoption of this method, the tree sheds its\r\nblossoms more beneficially than under any other circumstances. This\r\ncross-piece is generally made of a stake, or a reed, or else of a rope\r\nof hair or hemp, as is usually the case in Spain and at Brundisium.\r\nWhen the trellis is employed, wine is produced in greater quantities;\r\nthis method has its name of “compluviata” from the “compluvium” or\r\nsquare opening in the roofs of our houses; the trellis is divided into\r\nfour compartments by as many cross-pieces. This mode of planting the\r\nvine will now be treated of, and it will be found equally applicable to\r\nevery kind, with the only difference that under this last method the\r\noperation is somewhat more complicated.\r\n\r\nThe vine is planted three different ways; in a soil that has been\r\nturned up with the spade—the best of the three; in furrows, which is\r\nthe next best; and in holes, the least advisable method of all: of the\r\nway in which ground is prepared by digging, we have made sufficient\r\nmention already. (22.) In preparing the furrows[3109] for the vine it\r\nwill be quite sufficient if they are a spade in breadth; but if holes\r\nare employed for the purpose, they should be three feet every way.\r\nThe depth required for every kind of vine is three feet; it should,\r\ntherefore, be made a point not to transplant any vine that is less than\r\nthree feet in length, allowing then two buds to be above the ground. It\r\nwill be necessary, too, to soften the earth by working little furrows\r\nat the bottom of the hole, and mixing it up with manure. Where the\r\nground is declivitous, it is requisite that the hole should be deeper,\r\nin addition to which it should be artificially elevated on the edge of\r\nthe lower side. Holes of this nature, which are made a little longer,\r\nto receive two vines, are known as “alvei,” or beds. The root of the\r\nvine should occupy the middle of the hole, and when firmly fixed in\r\nthe ground it should incline at the top due east; its first support it\r\nought to receive from a reed.[3110] The vineyard should be bounded by a\r\ndecuman[3111] path eighteen feet in width, sufficiently wide, in fact,\r\nto allow two carts to pass each other; others, again, should run at\r\nright angles to it, ten feet in width, and passing through the middle\r\nof each jugerum; or else, if the vineyard is of very considerable\r\nextent, cardinal[3112] paths may be formed instead of them, of the same\r\nbreadth as the decuman path. At the end, too, of every five of the\r\nstays a path should be made to run, or, in other words, there should be\r\none continuous cross-piece to every five stays; each space that is thus\r\nincluded from one end to the other forming a bed.[3113]\r\n\r\nWhere the soil is dense and hard it must be turned up only with the\r\nspade, and nothing but quicksets should be planted there; but where,\r\non the other hand, it is thin and loose, mallet-shoots even may be\r\nset either in hole or furrow. Where the ground is declivitous it is a\r\nbetter plan to draw furrows across than to turn up all the soil with\r\nthe spade, so that the falling away of the earth may be counteracted by\r\nthe position of the cross-pieces.[3114] It will be best, too, where the\r\nweather is wet or the soil naturally dry, to plant the mallet-shoots\r\nin autumn, unless, indeed, there is anything in the nature of the\r\nlocality to counteract it; for while a dry, hot soil makes it necessary\r\nto plant in autumn, in a moist, cold one it may be necessary to defer\r\nit until the end of spring even. In a parched soil, too, it would be\r\nquite in vain to plant quicksets, and it is far from advantageous to\r\nset mallet-shoots in a dry ground, except just after a fall of rain.\r\nOn the other hand, in moist localities, a vine in leaf even may be\r\ntransplanted and thrive very well, and that, too, even as late as the\r\nsummer solstice, in Spain, for example. It is of very considerable\r\nadvantage that there should be no wind stirring on the day of planting,\r\nand, though many persons are desirous that there should be a south wind\r\nblowing at the time, Cato[3115] is of quite a different way of thinking.\r\n\r\nIn a soil of medium quality, it is best to leave an interval of\r\nfive[3116] feet between every two vines; where it is very fertile the\r\ndistance should be five feet at least, and where it is poor and thin\r\neight at the very most. The Umbri and the Marsi leave intervals between\r\ntheir vines of as much as twenty feet in length, for the purpose of\r\nploughing between them; such a plot of ground as this they call by the\r\nname of “porculetum.” In a rainy, foggy locality, the plants ought to\r\nbe set wider apart, but in dry spots nearer to one another. Careful\r\nobservation has discovered various methods of economizing space; thus,\r\nfor instance, when a vineyard is planted in shaded ground, a seed-plot\r\nis formed there as well; or, in other words, at the same time that the\r\nquickset is planted in the place which it is finally to occupy, the\r\nmallet-shoot intended for transplanting is set between the vines, as\r\nwell as between the rows. By adopting this method, each jugerum will\r\nproduce about sixteen thousand quicksets; and the result is, that two\r\nyears’ fruit is gained thereby, a cutting planted being two years later\r\nin bearing than a quickset transplanted. Quicksets, when growing in\r\na vineyard, are cut down at the end of a year, leaving only a single\r\neye above ground; some manure is then placed upon the spot, and a\r\nstay driven in close to the plant. In the same manner it is again cut\r\ndown at the end[3117] of the second year, and from this it acquires\r\nadditional strength, and receives nutriment to enable it to endure the\r\nonerous task of reproduction. If this is neglected, in its over-haste\r\nto bear it will shoot up slim and meagre, like a bulrush, and from not\r\nbeing subjected to such a training, will grow to nothing but wood.\r\nIn fact, there is no tree that grows with greater eagerness than the\r\nvine, and if its strength is not carefully husbanded for the bearing of\r\nfruit, it will be sure to grow to nothing but wood.\r\n\r\nThe best props for supporting the vine are those which we have already\r\nmentioned,[3118] or else stays made of the robur and the olive; if\r\nthese cannot be procured, then props of juniper, cypress, laburnum,\r\nor elder,[3119] must be employed. If any other wood is used for the\r\npurpose, the stakes should be cut at the end each year: reeds tied\r\ntogether in bundles make excellent cross-rails for the vine, and will\r\nlast as long as five years. Sometimes the shorter stock-branches of the\r\nvines are brought together and tied with vine-cuttings, like so many\r\ncords: by this method an arcade is formed, known to us by the name of\r\n“funetum.”\r\n\r\nThe vine, by the end of the third year, throws out strong and vigorous\r\nstock-branches with the greatest rapidity, and these in due time form\r\nthe tree; after this, it begins to mount the cross-piece. Some persons\r\nare in the habit of “blinding” the vine at this period, by removing the\r\neyes with the end of the pruning-knife turned upwards, their object\r\nbeing to increase the length of the branches—a most injurious practice,\r\nhowever; for it is far better to let the tree become habituated to\r\ngrow of itself, and to prune away the tendrils every now and then when\r\nthey have reached the cross-rail, so long as it may be deemed proper\r\nto add to its strength. There are some persons who forbid the vine\r\nto be touched for a whole year after it has been transplanted, and\r\nwho say that the pruning-knife ought never to be used before it is\r\nfive years old; and then at that period they are for cutting it down\r\nso completely as to leave three buds only. Others, again, cut down\r\nthe vine within a year even after it has been transplanted, but then\r\nthey take care to let the stem increase every year by three or four\r\njoints, bringing it on a level with the cross-piece by the fourth.\r\nThese two methods, however, both of them, retard the fruit and render\r\nthe tree stunted and knotty, as we see the case in all dwarf trees.\r\nThe best plan is to make the parent stem as robust and vigorous as\r\npossible, and then the wood will be sure to be strong and hardy. It\r\nis far from safe, too, to take slips from a cicatrized stem; such a\r\npractice is erroneous, and only the result of ignorance. All cuttings\r\nof this nature are sure to be the offspring of acts of violence, and\r\nnot in reality of the tree itself. The vine, while growing, should\r\nbe possessed of all its natural strength; and we find that when left\r\nentirely to itself, it will throw out wood in every part; for there is\r\nno portion of it that Nature does not act upon. When the stem has grown\r\nsufficiently strong for the purpose, it should at once be trained to\r\nthe cross-piece; if, however, it is but weak, it should be cut down so\r\nas to lie below the hospitable shelter of the cross-piece. Indeed, it\r\nis the strength of the stem, and not its age, that ought to decide the\r\nmatter. It is not advisable[3120] to attempt to train a vine before the\r\nstem has attained the thickness of the thumb; but in the year after it\r\nhas reached the frame, one or two stock-branches should be preserved,\r\naccording to the strength developed by the parent tree. The same, too,\r\nmust be done the succeeding year, if the weakness of the stem demands\r\nit; and in the next, two more should be added. Still, however, there\r\nshould never be more than four branches allowed to grow; in one word,\r\nthere must be no indulgence shown, and every exuberance in the tree\r\nmust in all cases be most carefully repressed; for such is the nature\r\nof the vine, that it is more eager to bear than it is to live. It\r\nshould be remembered, too, that all that is subtracted from the wood\r\nis so much added to the fruit. The vine, in fact, would much rather\r\nproduce shoots and tendrils than fruit, because[3121] its fruit, after\r\nall, is but a transitory possession: hence it is that it luxuriates to\r\nits own undoing, and instead of really gaining ground, exhausts itself.\r\n\r\nThe nature, too, of the soil will afford some very useful suggestions.\r\nWhere it is thin and hungry, even though the vine should display\r\nconsiderable vigour, it should be pruned down below the cross-piece\r\nand kept there, so that all the shoots may be put forth below it. The\r\ninterval, however, between the top of the vine and the cross-piece\r\nought to be but very small; so much so, indeed, as to leave it hopes,\r\nas it were, of reaching it, which, however, it must never be suffered\r\nto do; for it should never be allowed to recline thereon and spread\r\nand run on at its ease. This mode of culture ought, in fact, to be so\r\nnicely managed, that the vine should show an inclination rather to grow\r\nin body than to run to wood.\r\n\r\nThe main branch should have two or three buds left below the\r\ncross-piece that give promise of bearing wood, and it should be\r\ncarefully trained along the rail, and drawn close to it in such a\r\nmanner as to be supported by it, and not merely hang loosely from it.\r\nWhen this is done, it should be tightly fastened also with a binding\r\nthree buds off, a method which will greatly contribute to check the too\r\nabundant growth of the wood, while stouter shoots will be thrown out\r\nbelow the ligature: it is absolutely forbidden, however, to tie the\r\nextremity of the main branch. When all this is done, Nature operates\r\nin the following way—the parts that are allowed to fall downward, or\r\nthose which are held fast by the ligature, give out fruit, those at the\r\nbend of the branch more particularly. On the other hand, the portion\r\nthat lies below the ligature throws out wood; by reason, I suppose, of\r\nthe interception of the vital spirit and the marrow or pith, previously\r\nmentioned:[3122] the wood, too, that is grown under these circumstances\r\nwill bear fruit in the following year. In this way there are two kinds\r\nof stock branches: the first of which, issuing from the solid stock,\r\ngives promise of wood only for this year, and is known as the leaf\r\nstock-branch;[3123] while that which grows beyond the mark made by\r\nthe ligature is a fruit stock-branch.[3124] There are other kinds,\r\nagain, that shoot from the stock-branches when they are a year old,\r\nand these are in all cases fruit stock-branches. There is left, also,\r\nbeneath the cross-piece a shoot that is known as the reserve[3125]\r\nshoot, being always a young stock-branch, with not more than three buds\r\nupon it. This is intended to give out wood the next year, in case the\r\nvine by over-luxuriance should happen to exhaust itself. Close to it\r\nthere is another bud left, no bigger than a wart; this is known as the\r\n“furunculus,”[3126] and is kept in readiness in case the reserve shoot\r\nshould fail.\r\n\r\nThe vine, if enticed to bear fruit before the seventh year from its\r\nbeing planted as a slip, will pine[3127] away, become as slim as a\r\nbulrush, and die. It is thought equally undesirable, too, to let an\r\nold stock-branch range far and wide, and extend as far as the fourth\r\nstay from the stem; to such a branch the name of dragon[3128]-branch\r\nis given by some, and of juniculus by others; if these are allowed to\r\nspread, they will run to wood only, and make male vines, as they are\r\ncalled. When a vine has become quite hard, it is an extremely bad plan\r\nto use it for reproduction by layers. When the vine is five years old\r\nthe stock-branches are twisted, but each is allowed to throw out some\r\nnew wood; and so from one to another, care being taken to prune away\r\nthe old wood. It is always the best plan, however, to leave a reserve\r\nshoot; but this should always be very near the main stem of the vine,\r\nnot at a greater distance, in fact, than that already mentioned.[3129]\r\nIf, too, the stock branches should throw out too luxuriantly, they must\r\nbe twisted, the object being that the vine may put forth no more than\r\nfour secondary branches, or even two only, if it happens to be a single\r\ncross-railed vine.\r\n\r\nIf the vine is to be trained to grow without any stay at all, still it\r\nwill stand in need, at first, of some support or other, until it has\r\nlearnt to support itself: in all other respects the mode of proceeding\r\nwill be the same at first. When pruning, it will be necessary that the\r\nthumb-branches[3130] should be arranged in equal numbers on either\r\nside, in order that the fruit may not overload one side of the tree;\r\nand we may here remark by the way, that the fruit by its weight is\r\napt to bear down the tree and counteract any tendency to increase in\r\nheight. The vine, unsupported, when more than three feet in height,\r\nbegins to bend, but the others do not, until they are five feet\r\nhigh at the least; care should be taken, however, never to let them\r\nexceed the height of a man of moderate stature. Growers are in the\r\nhabit of surrounding the vines that creep along the ground with a low\r\nfence[3131] for them to lean upon; and round this fence they dig a\r\ntrench by way of precaution, for fear lest the branches in their range\r\nshould meet one another and so come into collision. The greater part\r\nof the world, in fact, gather grapes at their vintage, grown in this\r\nfashion, and lying upon the ground—at all events, it is so in Africa,\r\nEgypt, and Syria; throughout the whole of Asia, too, and in many parts\r\nof Europe as well, this method prevails. In such cases the vine ought\r\nto be kept down close to the ground, and the root should be nurtured at\r\nthe same time and in just the same way as in the case of the vine that\r\ngrows on the cross-piece. Care, too, should be taken to leave only the\r\nyoung thumb-shoots, together with three buds, where it is a prolific\r\nsoil, two where it is poor and thin: it is better, too, that the shoots\r\nshould be numerous than individually long. The influences of soil, of\r\nwhich we have made mention already, will make themselves felt all the\r\nmore powerfully the nearer the grapes grow to the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is a very advantageous plan to separate[3132] the various species\r\nof vines and to set them in different compartments—for the mixture of\r\ndifferent varieties is apt to deteriorate the flavour not only of the\r\nmust, but the wine even as well. If, again, for some reason or other,\r\nthe different kinds must be intermingled, it will be requisite to keep\r\nall those together which ripen at exactly the same period. The more\r\nfertile and the more level the soil, the higher the cross-pieces must\r\nbe placed.[3133] High cross-pieces, too, are best suited to localities\r\nthat are subject to heavy dews and fogs, but not to those that are\r\nexposed to high winds; on the other hand, where the soil is thin,\r\nparched, and arid, or exposed to the wind, the cross-pieces should\r\nbe set lower. The cross-piece should be fastened to the stay with\r\ncords tied as tight as possible, while the bindings used for tying\r\nthe vine should be thin. As to the various species of vines, and the\r\nsoils and climates requisite for the growth of each, we have already\r\ntreated[3134] of them, when enumerating the several varieties of the\r\nvine and the wines which they produce.\r\n\r\nWith reference to other points connected with the culture of the vine,\r\nthere are very considerable doubts. Many persons recommend that the\r\nvineyard should be turned up with the spade after every dew that falls\r\nin the summer. Others, again, forbid this practice when the vine is in\r\nbud; for the clothes, they say, of the people coming and going to and\r\nfro are apt to catch the buds, and either knock or rub them off; it\r\nis for this reason, too, that they are so careful to keep all animals\r\naway from the vines, those with long wool in particular, as it is very\r\napt to pull off the buds. Raking, too, they say, is very injurious to\r\nthe vine while the grape is forming; and it will be quite sufficient,\r\nthey assure us, if the ground is turned up three times in the year,\r\nafter the vernal equinox—first, at the rising of the Vergiliæ,[3135]\r\nthe second at the rising of the Dog-star, and the third time just as\r\nthe grape is turning black. Some persons make it a rule that an old\r\nvineyard shall have one turning up between the time of vintage and\r\nthe winter solstice, though others, again, are of opinion that it is\r\nquite sufficient to bare the roots and manure them. They turn up the\r\nground again after the ides of April,[3136] but before the time for\r\ngermination, or, in other words, the sixth of the ides of May;[3137]\r\nthen again before the tree begins to blossom, after it has shed its\r\nblossom, and, last of all, when the grape is just on the turn. The\r\nmost skilful growers say that if the ground is dug up oftener than\r\nnecessary, the grapes will become so remarkably thin-skinned as to\r\nburst. When the ground is turned up, care should be taken to do it\r\nbefore the hot hours of the day; a clayey soil, too, should never be\r\nploughed or dug. The dust that is raised in digging is beneficial[3138]\r\nto the vine, it is said, by protecting it from the heat of the sun and\r\nthe injurious effects of fogs.\r\n\r\nThe spring clearing ought to be done, it is universally admitted,\r\nwithin ten days after the ides of May,[3139] and before the\r\nblossoming begins; in addition to which, it should always be done\r\nbelow the cross-piece. As to the second clearing, opinions differ\r\nvery considerably. Some think it ought to be done when the blossoming\r\nis over, others, again, when the grapes are nearly at maturity. This\r\npoint, however, may be decided by following the advice of Cato on the\r\nsubject; for we must now pass on to a description of the proper mode of\r\npruning the vine.\r\n\r\nImmediately after[3140] the vintage, and while the weather is still\r\nwarm, the work of pruning[3141] begins; this, however, ought never to\r\nbe done, for certain physical reasons,[3142] before the rising of the\r\nEagle, as we shall have occasion to explain in the following Book. Nor\r\nshould it be done either when the west winds begin to prevail, for\r\neven then there is great doubt whether a fault may not be committed by\r\nbeing in too great haste to commence the work. If any return of wintry\r\nweather should chance to nip the vines, while still labouring under the\r\nwounds recently inflicted on them in pruning, there is little doubt\r\nthat their buds will become quite benumbed with cold, the wounds will\r\nopen again, and the eyes, moistened by the juices that distil from the\r\ntree, will become frost-bitten by the rigour of the weather. For who\r\nis there,[3142] in fact, that does not know that the buds are rendered\r\nbrittle by frost? All this, however, depends upon accurate calculations\r\nin the management of large grounds, and the blame of precipitation\r\ncannot with any justice be laid upon Nature. The earlier the vine is\r\npruned, in suitable weather, the greater is the quantity of wood, while\r\nthe later the pruning, the more abundant is the fruit. Hence it is that\r\nit is most advisable to prune the poor meagre vines first, and to defer\r\npruning the more thriving ones to the very last. In pruning, due care\r\nshould always be taken to cut in a slanting direction, in order[3143]\r\nthat the rain may run off with all the greater facility. The wounds,\r\ntoo, should look downwards towards the ground, and should be made as\r\nlightly as possible, the edge of the knife being well-sharpened for the\r\npurpose, so as to make a clean cut each time. Care should be taken,\r\ntoo, to cut always between two buds, and that the eyes are not injured\r\nin the operation. It is generally thought that wherever the vine is\r\nblack, all those parts may be cut off, the healthy parts not being\r\ntouched; as no useful shoots can be put forth by wood that is bad in\r\nitself. If a meagre vine has not good stock-shoots, the best plan is to\r\ncut it down to the ground, and then to train new ones. In clearing away\r\nthe leaves, too, those leaves should not be removed which accompany the\r\nclusters, for by so doing the grapes are made to fall off, except where\r\nthe vine happens to be young. Those leaves are regarded as useless\r\nwhich grow on the sides of the trunk and not from an eye; and so, too,\r\nare the bunches which shoot from the hard, strong wood, and are only to\r\nbe removed by the aid of the knife.\r\n\r\nSome persons are of opinion that it is a better plan to fix the stay\r\nmidway between two vines; and, indeed, by the adoption of this method\r\nthe roots are cleared with greater facility. It is best, however, where\r\nthe vine needs but a single cross-rail, due care being taken that the\r\nrail is a strong one, and the locality not exposed to high winds. In\r\nthe case of those vines which require trellissed cross-rails, the stay\r\nshould be placed as near as possible to the burden it has to support;\r\nin order, however, that there may be no impediment thrown in the way of\r\nclearing the roots, it may be placed at the distance of one cubit from\r\nthe stock, but not more. It is generally recommended to clear the roots\r\nbefore the pruning[3144] is commenced.\r\n\r\nCato[3145] gives the following general precepts in relation to the\r\nculture of the vine:—“Let the vine grow as high as possible, and fasten\r\nit firmly, but not too tight. You should treat it in the following\r\nmanner. Clean the roots of the vine at seed-time, and after pruning\r\nit dig about it, and then begin to labour at the ground, by tracing\r\nwith the plough continuous furrows every way. Plant the young vines in\r\nlayers as early as possible, and then break up the ground about them.\r\nIf the vine is old, take care and prune it as little as possible. In\r\npreference, bend the vine into the ground for layers, if necessary,\r\nand cut it at the end of two years. The proper time for cutting the\r\nyoung vine, is when it has gained sufficient strength. If the vineyard\r\nis bald of vines, then draw furrows between them, and plant quicksets\r\nthere: but let no shadow be thrown on the furrows, and take care and\r\ndig them often. If the vineyard is old, sow ocinum[3146] there, in\r\ncase the trees are meagre: but take care and sow there nothing that\r\nbears seed. Put manure, chaff, and grape-husks about the roots, or,\r\nindeed, anything of a similar nature that will give the tree additional\r\nstrength. As soon as the vine begins to throw out leaves, set about\r\nclearing them. Fasten the young trees in more places than one, so that\r\nthe stem may not break. As soon as it begins to run along the stay,\r\nfasten down the young branches lightly, and extend them, in order that\r\nthey may gain the right position. When the grape begins to be mottled,\r\nthen tie down the vine. The first season for grafting the vine is the\r\nspring, the other when the grape is in blossom; the last period is the\r\nbest. If it is your wish to transplant an old vine, you will only be\r\nable to do so in case it is no thicker than the arm: first, however,\r\nyou must prune it, taking care not to have more than two buds upon\r\nthe stem. Then dig it well up by the roots, being careful to trace\r\nthem, and using every possible precaution not to injure them. Place it\r\nin the hole or furrow exactly in the position in which it has stood\r\nbefore, then cover it with earth, which should be well trodden down.\r\nYou must then prop it up, fasten it, and turn it in the same direction\r\nas before; after which, dig about it repeatedly.” The ocinum that Cato\r\nhere recommends to be sown in the vineyards, is a fodder known by that\r\nname by the ancients; it thrives in the shade remarkably well, and\r\nreceived its name[3147] from the rapidity with which it grows.\r\n\r\n(23.) We come now to speak of the method of growing vines upon\r\ntrees,[3148] a mode that has been condemned[3149] in the strongest\r\nterms by the Saserna’s, both father and son, and up-held by Scrofa,\r\nthese being our most ancient writers on agriculture next to Cato, and\r\nmen of remarkable skill. Indeed, Scrofa himself will not admit that\r\nit is beneficial anywhere except in Italy. The experience of ages,\r\nhowever, has sufficiently proved that the wines of the highest quality\r\nare only grown upon vines attached to trees, and that even then the\r\nchoicest wines are produced by the upper part of the tree, the produce\r\nof the lower part being more abundant; such being the beneficial\r\nresults of elevating the vine. It is with a view to this that the trees\r\nemployed for this purpose are selected. In the first rank of all stands\r\nthe elm,[3150] with the exception of the Atinian variety, which is\r\ncovered with too many leaves; and next comes the black poplar, which is\r\nvalued for a similar reason, being not so densely covered with leaves.\r\nMost people, too, by no means hold the ash and the fig in disesteem,\r\nas also the olive, if it is not overshadowed with branches. We have\r\ntreated at sufficient length already of the planting and culture of\r\nthese several trees.\r\n\r\nThey must not be touched with the knife before the end of three years;\r\nand then the branches are preserved, on each side in its turn, the\r\npruning being done in alternate years. In the sixth year the vine is\r\nunited to the tree. In Italy beyond the Padus, in addition to the\r\ntrees already mentioned, they plant for their vines the cornel, the\r\nopulus, the linden, the maple, the ash, the yoke-elm, and the quercus;\r\nwhile in Venetia they grow willows for the purpose, on account of the\r\nhumidity[3151] of the soil. The top of the elm is lopped away, and\r\nthe branches of the middle are regularly arranged in stages; no tree\r\nin general being allowed to exceed twenty feet in height. The stories\r\nbegin to spread out in the tree at eight feet from the ground, in\r\nthe hilly districts and upon dry soils, and at twelve in champaign\r\nand moist localities. The hands[3152] of the trunk ought to have a\r\nsouthern aspect, and the branches that project from them should be\r\nstiff and rigid like so many fingers; at the same time due care should\r\nbe taken to lop off the thin beardlike twigs, in order to check the\r\ngrowth of all shade. The interval best suited for the trees, if it is\r\nthe grower’s intention to keep the soil turned up with the plough, is\r\nforty feet back and front, and twenty at the side; if it is not to be\r\nturned up, then twenty feet[3153] every way will do. A single tree is\r\noften made to support as many as ten vines, and the grower is greatly\r\ncensured who attaches less than three. It is worse than useless to\r\nattach the vine before the tree has gained its full strength, as in\r\nsuch case its rapidity of growth would only tend to kill the tree. It\r\nis necessary to plant the vine in a trench three feet in depth, leaving\r\nan interval of one foot between it and the tree. In this case there\r\nis no necessity for using mallet shoots, or for going to any expense\r\nin spading or digging; for this method of training on trees has this\r\nadvantage in particular, that it is beneficial even to the vine that\r\ncorn should be sown in the same soil; in addition to which, from its\r\nheight, it is quite able to protect itself, and does not call for the\r\nnecessity, as in the case of an ordinary vineyard, of enclosing it with\r\nwalls and hedges or ditches, made at a considerable expense, to protect\r\nit from injury by animals.\r\n\r\nIn the method of training upon trees, reproduction from quicksets\r\nor from layers is the only mode employed of all those that have\r\nbeen previously described; the growing by layers being effected two\r\ndifferent ways, as already mentioned. The plan, however, of growing\r\nfrom layers in baskets set upon the stages[3154] of the tree is the\r\nmost approved one, as it ensures an efficient protection from the\r\nravages of cattle; while, according to another method, a vine or else\r\na stock-branch is bent into the ground near the tree it has previously\r\noccupied, or else the nearest one that may be at liberty. It is\r\nrecommended that all parts of the parent tree that appear above ground\r\nshould then be scraped, so that it may not throw out wood; while at the\r\nsame time there are never less than four buds on the part that is put\r\ninto the ground for the purpose of taking root; there are also two buds\r\nleft above ground at the head. The vine intended for training on a tree\r\nis planted in a furrow four feet long, three broad, and two and a half\r\nin depth. At the end of a year the layer is cut to the pith, to enable\r\nit to strengthen gradually at the root; after which, the end of the\r\nbranch is pruned down to within two buds from the ground. At the end of\r\ntwo years the layer is completely separated from the stock, and buried\r\ndeeper in the ground, that it may not shoot at the place where it has\r\nbeen cut. As to the quicksets, they ought to be removed directly after\r\nthe vintage.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times, a plan has been discovered of planting a dragon\r\nbranch near the tree—that being the name given to an old stock-branch\r\nthat has become hard and tough in the course of years. For this\r\npurpose, it is cut as long as possible, and the bark is taken off\r\nfrom three-fourths of its length, that being the portion which is\r\nto be buried in the ground; hence it is, too, that it is called a\r\n“barked”[3155] plant. It is then laid at full length in the furrow,\r\nthe remaining part protruding from the ground and reclining against\r\nthe tree. This method is the most speedy one that can be adopted for\r\ngrowing the vine. If the vine is meagre or the soil impoverished, it\r\nis usual to keep it cut down as near to the ground as possible, until\r\nsuch time as the root is strengthened. Care, too, should be taken not\r\nto plant it covered with dew,[3156] nor yet while the wind is blowing\r\nfrom the north. The vine itself ought to look towards the north-east,\r\nbut the young stock-shoots should have a southern aspect.\r\n\r\nThere should not be too great haste[3157] in pruning a young vine, but\r\na beginning should be made by giving the wood and foliage a circular\r\nform, care being taken not to prune it until it has become quite\r\nstrong; it should be remembered, too, that the vine, when trained upon\r\na tree, is generally a year later in bearing fruit than when grown on\r\nthe cross-piece. There are some persons, again, who altogether forbid\r\nthat a vine should be pruned until such time as it equals the tree in\r\nheight. At the first pruning it may be cut to within six feet from the\r\nground, below which a shoot must be left, and encouraged to run out by\r\nbending the young wood. Upon this shoot, when pruned, there should not\r\nbe more than three buds left. The branches that take their rise from\r\nthese buds should be trained in the following year upon the lowermost\r\nstages of the tree, and so in each successive year taught to climb to\r\nthe higher ones. Care, too, should always be taken to leave one hard,\r\nwoody branch at each stage, as well as one breeding shoot, at liberty\r\nto mount as high as it pleases. In addition to these precautions, in\r\nall pruning, those shoots should be cut off which have borne fruit the\r\nlast year, and after the tendrils[3158] have been cut away on every\r\nside fresh branches should be trained to run along the stages. In Italy\r\nthe pruning is so managed that the shoots and tendrils of the vines\r\nare arranged so as to cover the branches of the tree, while the shoots\r\nof the vine in their turn are surrounded with clusters of grapes. In\r\nGallia, on the other hand, the vine is trained to pass from tree to\r\ntree. On the Æmilian Way, again, the vine is seen embracing the trunks\r\nof the Atinian elms that line the road, while at the same time it\r\ncarefully avoids their foliage.[3159]\r\n\r\nIt is a mark of ignorance in some persons to suspend the vine with a\r\ncord beneath the branches of the tree, to the great risk of stifling\r\nit; for it ought to be merely kept up with a withe of osier, and not\r\ntightly laced. Indeed, in those places where the willow abounds, the\r\nwithes that it affords are preferred, on account of their superior\r\nsuppleness, while the Sicilians employ for the purpose a grass, which\r\nthey call “ampelodesmos:”[3160] throughout the whole of Greece, rushes,\r\ncyperus, and sedge[3161] are similarly employed. When at any time the\r\nvine has been liberated from its bonds, it should be allowed to range\r\nuncontrolled for some days, and to spread abroad at pleasure, as well\r\nas to recline upon the ground which it has been looking down upon the\r\nwhole year through. For in the same manner that beasts of burden when\r\nreleased from the yoke, and dogs when they have returned from the\r\nchase, love to roll themselves on the ground, just so does the vine\r\ndelight to stretch its loins. The tree itself, too, seems to rejoice,\r\nand, thus relieved from the continuous weight which has burdened it,\r\nto have all the appearance of now enjoying a free respiration. Indeed,\r\nthere is no object in all the economy of Nature that does not desire\r\ncertain alternations for the enjoyment of rest, witness the succession\r\nof night and day, for instance. It is for this reason that it is\r\nforbidden to prune the vine directly the vintage is over, and while it\r\nis still exhausted by the process of reproduction.\r\n\r\nDirectly the vine has been pruned, it ought to be fastened again to\r\nthe tree, but in another place; for there is no doubt that it feels\r\nvery acutely the indentations that are made in it by the holdfasts. In\r\nthe Gallic method of cultivation they train out two branches at either\r\nside, if the trees are forty feet apart, and four if only twenty; where\r\nthey meet, these branches are fastened together and made to grow in\r\nunison; if, too, they are anywhere deficient in number or strength,\r\ncare is taken to fortify them by the aid of small rods. In a case,\r\nhowever, where the branches are not sufficiently long to meet, they\r\nare artificially prolonged by means of a hook, and so united to the\r\ntree that desires their company. The branches thus trained to unite\r\nthey used to prune at the end of the second year. But where the vine\r\nis aged, it is a better plan to give them a longer time to reach the\r\nadjoining tree, in case they should not have gained the requisite\r\nthickness; besides which, it is always good to encourage the growth of\r\nthe hard wood in the dragon branches.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another method,[3162] which occupies a middle place\r\nbetween this mode of propagation and that by layers. It consists of\r\nlaying the entire vine in the earth, and then splitting the stock\r\nasunder by means of wedges; the fibrous portions are then trained out\r\nin as many furrows, care being taken to support each of the slender\r\nplants by fastening it to a stake, and not to cut away the branches\r\nthat shoot from the sides. The growers of Novara, not content with\r\nthe multitude of shoots that run from tree to tree, nor yet with an\r\nabundance of branches, encourage the stock-branches to entwine around\r\nforks planted in the ground for the purpose; a method, however, which,\r\nin addition to the internal defects arising from the soil, imparts a\r\nharshness to the wine.\r\n\r\nThere is another fault, too, that is committed by the people of\r\nVarracina,[3163] near Rome—they only prune their vines every other\r\nyear; not, indeed, because it is advantageous to the tree, but from\r\na fear lest, from the low prices fetched by their wines, the expense\r\nmight exceed the profits. At Carseoli they adopt a middle course, by\r\npruning away only the rotten parts of the vine, as well as those which\r\nare beginning to wither, and leaving the rest to bear fruit, after thus\r\nclearing away all superfluous incumbrances. The only nutriment they\r\ngive it is this exemption from frequent pruning; but unless the soil\r\nshould happen to be a very rich one, the vine, under such a method of\r\ncultivation, will very soon degenerate to a wild state.\r\n\r\nThe vine that is thus trained requires the ground to be ploughed very\r\ndeep, though such is not the case for the sowing there of grain. It is\r\nnot customary to cut away the leaves in this case, which, of course,\r\nis so much labour spared. The trees themselves require pruning at the\r\nsame period as the vine, and are thinned by clearing away all useless\r\nbranches, and such parts as would only absorb the nutriment. We have\r\nalready[3164] stated that the parts that are lopped should never look\r\nnorth or south: and it will be better still, if they have not a western\r\naspect. The wounds thus made are very susceptible for a considerable\r\ntime, and heal with the greatest difficulty, if exposed to excesses of\r\ncold or heat. The vine when trained on a tree enjoys advantages that\r\nare not possessed by the others; for the latter have certain fixed\r\naspects, while in the former, it is easy to cover up the wounds made\r\nin pruning, or to turn them whichever way you please. When trees are\r\npruned at the top, cup-like cavities should be formed[3165] there, to\r\nprevent the water from lodging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—HOW GRAPES ARE PROTECTED FROM THE RAVAGES OF INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nStays, too, should be given to the vine for it to take hold of and\r\nclimb upwards, if they are taller than it. (24.) Espaliers[3166]\r\nfor vines of a high quality should be cut, it is said, at the\r\nQuinquatria,[3167] and when it is intended to keep the grapes, while\r\nthe moon is on the wane. We are assured, moreover, that those which\r\nare cut at the change of the moon, are exempt from the attacks of all\r\ninsects.[3168] According to another system, it is said that vines\r\nshould be pruned by night at full moon, and while it is in Leo,\r\nScorpio, Sagittarius, or Taurus: and that, in general, they ought to be\r\nplanted either when the moon is at full or on the increase. In Italy,\r\nten workmen will suffice for one hundred jugera of vineyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—THE DISEASES OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now treated sufficiently at length of the planting and\r\ncultivation of trees—(for we have already said enough of the palm[3169]\r\nand the cytisus,[3170] when speaking of the exotic trees)—we shall\r\nproceed, in order that nothing may be omitted, to describe other\r\ndetails relative to their nature, which are of considerable importance,\r\nwhen taken in connection with all that precedes. Trees, we find, are\r\nattacked by maladies; and, indeed, what created thing is there that is\r\nexempt from these evils? Still however, the affections of the forest\r\ntrees, it is said, are not attended[3171] with danger to them, and the\r\nonly damage they receive is from hail-storms while they are budding and\r\nblossoming; with the exception, indeed, of being nipped either by heat\r\nor cold blasts in unseasonable weather; for frost, when it comes at the\r\nproper times, as we have already stated,[3172] is serviceable to them.\r\n“Well but,” it will be said, “is not the vine sometimes killed with\r\ncold?” No doubt it is, and this it is through which we detect inherent\r\nfaults in the soils, for it is only in a cold soil that the vine will\r\ndie. Just in the same way, too, in winter we approve of cold, so long\r\nas it is the cold of the weather, and not of the ground. It is not the\r\nweakest trees, too, that are endangered in winter by frost, but the\r\nlarger ones. When they are thus attacked, it is the summit that dries\r\naway the first, from the circumstance that the sap becomes frozen\r\nbefore it is able to arrive there.\r\n\r\nSome diseases of trees are common to them all, while others, again,\r\nare peculiar to individual kinds. Worms[3173] are common to them all,\r\nand so, too, is sideration,[3174] with pains in the limbs,[3175] which\r\nare productive of debility in the various parts. Thus do we apply the\r\nnames of the maladies that prevail among mankind to those with which\r\nthe plants are afflicted. In the same way, too, we speak of their\r\nbodies being mutilated, the eyes of the buds being burnt up, with\r\nmany other expressions of a similar nature. It is in accordance with\r\nthe same phraseology that we say that trees are afflicted with hunger\r\nor indigestion, both of which result from the comparative amount of\r\nsap that they contain; while some, again, are troubled with obesity,\r\nas in the case of all the resinous trees, which, when suffering from\r\nexcessive fatness, are changed into a torch-tree.[3176] When the roots,\r\ntoo, begin to wax fat, trees, like animals, are apt to perish from\r\nexcess of fatness. Sometimes, too, a pestilence[3177] will prevail in\r\ncertain classes of trees, just as among men, we see maladies attack, at\r\none time the slave class, and at another the common people, in cities\r\nor in the country, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nTrees are more or less attacked by worms; but still, nearly all are\r\nsubject to them in some degree, and this the birds[3178] are able to\r\ndetect by the hollow sound produced on tapping at the bark. These worms\r\neven have now begun to be looked upon as delicacies[3179] by epicures,\r\nand the large ones found in the robur are held in high esteem; they are\r\nknown to us by the name of “cossis;” and are even fed with meal, in\r\norder to fatten them! But it is the pear, the apple, and the fig[3180]\r\nthat are most subject to their attacks, the trees that are bitter and\r\nodoriferous enjoying a comparative exemption from them. Of those which\r\ninfest the fig, some breed in the tree itself, while others, again, are\r\nproduced by the worm known as the cerastes; they all, however, equally\r\nassume the form of the cerastes,[3181] and emit a small shrill noise.\r\nThe service-tree is infested, too, with a red hairy worm, which kills\r\nit; and the medlar, when old, is subject to a similar malady.\r\n\r\nThe disease known as sideration entirely depends upon the heavens;\r\nand hence we may class under this head, the ill effects produced\r\nby hail-storms, carbunculation,[3182] and the damage caused by\r\nhoar-frosts. When the approach of spring tempts the still tender\r\nshoots to make their appearance, and they venture to burst forth, the\r\nmalady attacks them, and scorches up the eyes of the buds, filled as\r\nthey are with their milky juices: this is what upon flowers they call\r\n“charcoal”[3183] blight. The consequences of hoar-frost to plants are\r\neven more dangerous still, for when it has once settled, it remains\r\nthere in a frozen form, and there is never any wind to remove it,\r\nseeing that it never prevails except in weather that is perfectly calm\r\nand serene. Sideration, however, properly so called, is a certain heat\r\nand dryness that prevails at the rising of the[3184] Dog-star, and\r\nowing to which grafts and young trees pine away and die, the fig and\r\nthe vine more particularly. The olive, also, besides the worm, to which\r\nit is equally subject with the fig, is attacked by the measles,[3185]\r\nor as some think fit to call it, the fungus or platter; it is a sort\r\nof blast produced by the heat of the sun. Cato[3186] says that the red\r\nmoss[3187] is also deleterious to the olive. An excessive fertility,\r\ntoo, is very often injurious to the vine and the olive. Scab is a\r\nmalady common to all trees. Eruptions,[3188] too, and the attacks of\r\na kind of snail that grows on the bark, are diseases peculiar to the\r\nfig, but not in all countries; for there are some maladies that are\r\nprevalent in certain localities only.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that man is subject to diseases of the sinews, so are\r\nthe trees as well, and, like him, in two different ways. Either[3189]\r\nthe virulence of the disease manifests itself in the feet, or, what\r\nis the same thing, the roots of the tree, or else in the joints of\r\nthe fingers, or, in other words, the extremities of the branches that\r\nare most distant from the trunk. The parts that are thus affected\r\nbecome dry and shrivel up: the Greeks have appropriate names[3190] by\r\nwhich to distinguish each of these affections. In either case the\r\nfirst symptoms are that the tree is suffering from pain, and the parts\r\naffected become emaciated and brittle; then follows rapid consumption\r\nand ultimately death; the juices being no longer able to enter the\r\ndiseased parts, or, at all events, not circulating in them. The fig is\r\nmore particularly liable to this disease: but the wild fig is exempt\r\nfrom all that we have hitherto mentioned. Scab[3191] is produced by\r\nviscous dews which fall after the rising of the Vergiliæ; but if they\r\nhappen to fall copiously, they drench the tree, without making the bark\r\nrough. When the fig is thus attacked, the fruit falls off while green;\r\nand so, too, if there is too much rain. The fig suffers also from a\r\nsuperfluity of moisture in the roots.\r\n\r\nIn addition to worms and sideration, the vine is subject to a peculiar\r\ndisease of its own, which attacks it in the joints, and is produced\r\nfrom one of the three following causes:—either the destruction\r\nof the buds by stormy weather, or else the fact, as remarked by\r\nTheophrastus, that the tree, when pruned, has been cut with the\r\nincisions upwards,[3192] or has been injured from want of skill in\r\nthe cultivator. All the injury that is inflicted in these various\r\nways is felt by the tree in the joints more particularly. It must be\r\nconsidered also as a species of sideration, when the cold dews make\r\nthe blossoms fall off, and when the grapes harden[3193] before they\r\nhave attained their proper size. Vines also become sickly when they\r\nare perished with cold, and the eyes are frost-bitten just after they\r\nhave been pruned. Heat, too, out of season, is productive of similar\r\nresults: for everything is regulated according to a fixed order and\r\ncertain determinate movements. Some maladies, too, originate in\r\nerrors committed by the vine-dresser; when they are tied too tight,\r\nfor instance, as already mentioned,[3194] or when in trenching round\r\nthem the digger has struck them an unlucky blow, or when in ploughing\r\nabout them the roots have been strained through carelessness, or the\r\nbark has been stripped from off the trunk: sometimes, too, contusions\r\nare produced by the use of too blunt a pruning-knife. Through all the\r\ncauses thus enumerated the tree is rendered more sensitive to either\r\ncold or heat, as every injurious influence from without is apt to\r\nconcentrate in the wounds thus made. The apple, however, is the most\r\ndelicate of them all, and more particularly the one that bears the\r\nsweetest fruit. In some trees weakness induced by disease is productive\r\nof barrenness, and does not kill the tree; as in the pine[3195] for\r\ninstance, or the palm, when the top of the tree has been removed; for\r\nin such case the tree becomes barren, but does not die. Sometimes, too,\r\nthe fruit itself is sickly, independently of the tree; for example,\r\nwhen there is a deficiency of rain, or of warmth, or of wind, at the\r\nperiods at which they usually prevail, or when, on the other hand, they\r\nhave prevailed in excess; for in such cases the fruit will either drop\r\noff or else deteriorate. But the worst thing of all that can befall\r\nthe vine or the olive, is to be pelted with heavy showers just when\r\nthe tree is shedding its blossom, for then the fruit is sure to fall\r\noff[3196] as well.\r\n\r\nRain, too, is productive of the caterpillar, a noxious insect that\r\neats away the leaves, and, some of them, the blossoms as well; and\r\nthis in the olive even, as we find the case at Miletus; giving to the\r\nhalf-eaten tree a most loathsome appearance. This pest is produced by\r\nthe prevalence of a damp, languid heat; and if the sun should happen to\r\nshine after this with a more intense heat and burn them up, this pest\r\nonly gives place to another[3197] just as bad, the aspect only of the\r\nevil being changed.\r\n\r\nThere is still one other affection that is peculiar to the olive and\r\nthe vine, known as the “cobweb,”[3198] the fruit being enveloped in a\r\nweb, as it were, and so stifled. There are certain winds, too, that\r\nare particularly blighting to the olive and the vine, as also to other\r\nfruits as well: and then besides, the fruits themselves, independently\r\nof the tree, are very much worm-eaten in some years, the apple, pear,\r\nmedlar, and pomegranate for instance. In the olive the presence of the\r\nworm may be productive of a twofold result: if it grows beneath the\r\nskin, it will destroy the fruit, but if it is in the stone, it will\r\nonly gnaw it away, making the fruit all the larger. The prevalence of\r\nshowers after the rising of Arcturus[3199] prevents them from breeding;\r\nbut if the rains are accompanied with wind from the south, they will\r\nmake their appearance in the ripe fruit even, which are then very apt\r\nto fall. This happens more particularly in moist, watery localities;\r\nand even if they do not fall, the olives that are so affected are good\r\nfor nothing. There is a kind of fly also that is very troublesome to\r\nsome fruit, acorns and figs for instance: it would appear that they\r\nbreed from the juices[3200] secreted beneath the bark, which at this\r\nperiod are sweet. These trees, too, are generally in a diseased state\r\nwhen this happens.\r\n\r\nThere are certain temporary and local influences which cause\r\ninstantaneous death to trees, but which cannot properly be termed\r\ndiseases; such, for example, as consumption, blast, or the noxious\r\neffects of some winds that are peculiar to certain localities; of this\r\nlast nature are the Atabulus[3201] that prevails in Apulia, and the\r\nOlympias[3202] of Eubœa. This wind, if it happens to blow about the\r\nwinter solstice, nips the tree with cold, and shrivels it up to such\r\na degree that no warmth of the sun can ever revive it. Trees that are\r\nplanted in valleys, and are situate near the banks of rivers, are\r\nespecially liable to these accidents, the vine more particularly, the\r\nolive, and the fig. When this has been the case, it may instantly be\r\ndetected the moment the period for germination arrives, though, in the\r\nolive, somewhat later. With all of these trees, if the leaves fall off,\r\nit is a sign that they will recover; but if such is not the case, just\r\nwhen you would suppose that they have escaped uninjured, they die.\r\nSometimes, however, the leaves will become green again, after being dry\r\nand shrivelled. Other trees, again, in the northern regions, Pontus\r\nand Phrygia, for example, suffer greatly from cold or frost, in case\r\nthey should continue for forty days after the winter solstice. In these\r\ncountries, too, as well as in other parts, if a sharp frost or copious\r\nrains should happen to come on immediately after fructification, the\r\nfruit is killed in a very few days even.\r\n\r\nInjuries inflicted by the hand of man are productive also of bad\r\neffects. Thus, for instance, pitch, oil, and grease,[3203] if applied\r\nto trees, and young ones more particularly, are highly detrimental.\r\nThey may be killed, also, by removing a circular piece of the bark\r\nfrom around them, with the exception, indeed, of the cork-tree,[3204]\r\nwhich is rather benefitted than otherwise by the operation; for the\r\nbark as it gradually thickens tends to stifle and suffocate the tree:\r\nthe andrachle,[3205] too, receives no injury from it, if care is taken\r\nnot to cut the body of the tree. In addition to this, the cherry, the\r\nlime, and the vine shed their bark;[3206] not that portion of it,\r\nindeed, which is essential to life, and grows next the trunk, but the\r\npart that is thrown off, in proportion as the other grows beneath.\r\nIn some trees the bark is naturally full of fissures, the plane for\r\ninstance: in the linden it will all but grow again when removed. Hence,\r\nin those trees the bark of which admits of cicatrization, a mixture of\r\nclay and dung[3207] is employed by way of remedy; and sometimes with\r\nsuccess, in case excessive cold or heat does not immediately supervene.\r\nIn some trees, again, by the adoption of these methods death is only\r\nretarded, the robur and the quercus,[3208] for example. The season of\r\nthe year has also its peculiar influences; thus, if the bark is removed\r\nfrom the fir and the pine, while the sun is passing through Taurus\r\nor Gemini, the period of their germination, they will instantly die,\r\nwhile in winter they are able to withstand the injurious effects of it\r\nmuch longer: the same is the case, too, with the holm-oak, the robur,\r\nand the quercus. In the trees above mentioned, if it is only a narrow\r\ncircular strip of bark that is removed, no injurious effects will be\r\nperceptible; but in the case of the weaker trees, as well as those\r\nwhich grow in a thin soil, the same operation, if performed even on one\r\nside only, will be sure to kill them. The removal of the top,[3209] in\r\nthe pitch-tree, the cedar, and the cypress is productive of a similar\r\nresult; for if it is either cut off or destroyed by fire, the tree will\r\nnot survive: the same is the case, too, if they are bitten by the teeth\r\nof animals.\r\n\r\nVarro[3210] informs us, too, as we have already stated,[3211] that\r\nthe olive, if only licked by a she-goat, will be barren.[3212] When\r\nthus injured, some trees will die, while in others the fruit becomes\r\ndeteriorated, the almond,[3213] for instance, the fruit of which\r\nchanges from sweet to bitter. In other cases, again, the tree is\r\nimproved[3214] even—such, for instance, as the pear known in Chios as\r\nthe Phocian pear. We have already mentioned[3215] certain trees, also,\r\nthat are all the better for having the tops removed. Most trees perish\r\nwhen the trunk is split; but we must except the vine, the apple, the\r\nfig, and the pomegranate. Others, again, will die if only a wound is\r\ninflicted: the fig, however, as well as all the resinous trees, is\r\nproof against such injury. It is far from surprising that, when the\r\nroots of a tree are cut, death should be the result; most of them\r\nperish, however, when, not all the roots, but only the larger ones, and\r\nthose which are more essential to life, have been severed.\r\n\r\nTrees, too, will kill one another[3216] by their shade, or the density\r\nof their foliage, as also by the withdrawal of nourishment. Ivy,[3217]\r\nby clinging to a tree, will strangle[3218] it. The mistletoe, too, is\r\nfar from beneficial, and the cytisus is killed by the plant to which\r\nthe Greeks have given the name of halimon.[3219] It is the nature of\r\nsome plants not to kill, but to injure, by the odour they emit, or by\r\nthe admixture of their juices; such is the influence exercised by the\r\nradish and the laurel upon the vine.[3220] For the vine may reasonably\r\nbe looked upon as possessed of the sense of smell, and affected\r\nby odours in a singular degree; hence, when it is near a noxious\r\nexhalation, it will turn away and withdraw from it. It was from his\r\nobservation of this fact that Androcydes borrowed the radish[3221]\r\nas his antidote for drunkenness, recommending it to be eaten on such\r\noccasions. The vine, too, abhors all coleworts and garden herbs, and\r\nthe hazel[3222] as well; indeed it will become weak and ailing if they\r\nare not removed to a distance from it. Nitre, alum, warm sea-water, and\r\nthe shells of beans[3223] and fitches act as poisons on the vine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38. (25.)—PRODIGIES CONNECTED WITH TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the maladies which affect the various trees, we may find room\r\nfor portentous prodigies also. For we find some trees that have\r\nnever had a leaf upon them; a vine and a pomegranate bearing[3224]\r\nfruit adhering to the trunk, and not upon the shoots or branches; a\r\nvine, too, that bore grapes but had no leaves; and olives that have\r\nlost their leaves while the fruit remained upon the tree. There are\r\nsome marvels also connected with trees that are owing to accident;\r\nan olive that was completely burnt, has been known to revive, and\r\nin Bœotia, some fig-trees that had been quite eaten away by locusts\r\nbudded afresh.[3225] Trees, too, sometimes change their colour, and\r\nturn from black to white; this, however, must not always be looked\r\nupon as portentous, and more particularly in the case of those which\r\nare grown from seed; the white poplar, too, often becomes black. Some\r\npersons are of opinion also that the service-tree, if transplanted\r\nto a warmer locality, will become barren. But it is a prodigy, no\r\ndoubt, when sweet fruits become sour, or sour fruits sweet; and when\r\nthe wild fig becomes changed into the cultivated one, or vice versâ.\r\nIt is sadly portentous,[3226] too, when the tree becomes deteriorated\r\nby the change, the cultivated olive changing into the wild, and the\r\nwhite grape or fig becoming black: such was the case, also, when upon\r\nthe arrival of Xerxes there, a plane-tree at Laodicea was transformed\r\ninto an olive. In such narratives as these, the book written in\r\nGreek by Aristander abounds, not to enter any further on so extended\r\na subject; and we have in Latin the Commentaries of C. Epidius, in\r\nwhich we find it stated that trees have even been known to speak. In\r\nthe territory of Cumæ, a tree, and a very ominous presage it was, sank\r\ninto the earth shortly before the civil wars of Pompeius Magnus began,\r\nleaving only a few of the branches protruding from the ground. The\r\nSibylline Books were accordingly consulted, and it was found that a war\r\nof extermination was impending, which would be attended with greater\r\ncarnage the nearer it should approach the city of Rome.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of prodigy, too, is the springing up of a tree in some\r\nextraordinary and unusual place, the head of a statue, for instance,\r\nor an altar, or upon another tree even.[3227] A fig-tree shot forth\r\nfrom a laurel at Cyzicus, just before the siege of that city; and so in\r\nlike manner, at Tralles, a palm issued from the pedestal of the statue\r\nof the Dictator Cæsar, at the period of his civil wars. So, too, at\r\nRome, in the Capitol there, in the time of the wars against Perseus,\r\na palm-tree grew from the head of the statue of Jupiter, a presage\r\nof impending victory and triumphs. This palm, however, having been\r\ndestroyed by a tempest, a fig-tree sprang up in the very same place,\r\nat the period of the lustration made by the censors M. Messala and C.\r\nCassius,[3228] a time at which, according to Piso, an author of high\r\nauthority, all sense of shame had been utterly banished. Above all the\r\nprodigies, however, that have ever been heard of, we ought to place the\r\none that was seen in our own time, at the period of the fall of the\r\nEmperor Nero, in the territory of Marrucinum; a plantation of olives,\r\nbelonging to Vectius Marcellus, one of the principal members of the\r\nEquestrian order, bodily crossed the public highway, while the fields\r\nthat lay on the opposite side of the road passed over to supply the\r\nplace which had been thus vacated by the olive-yard.[3229]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39. (26.)—TREATMENT OF THE DISEASES OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving set forth the various maladies by which trees are attacked, it\r\nseems only proper to mention the most appropriate remedies as well.\r\nSome of these remedies may be applied to all kinds of trees in common,\r\nwhile others, again, are peculiar to some only. The methods that are\r\ncommon to them all, are, baring the roots, or moulding them up, thus\r\nadmitting the air or keeping it away, as the case may be; giving them\r\nwater, or depriving them of it, refreshing them with the nutritious\r\njuices of manure, and lightening them of their burdens by pruning. The\r\noperation, too, of bleeding,[3230] as it were, is performed upon them\r\nby withdrawing their juices, and the bark is scraped all round[3231] to\r\nimprove them. In the vine, the stock branches are sometimes lengthened\r\nout, and at other times repressed; the buds too are smoothed, and in\r\na measure polished up, in case the cold weather has made them rough\r\nand scaly. These remedies are better suited to some kinds of trees and\r\nless so to others: thus the cypress, for instance, has a dislike to\r\nwater, and manifests an aversion to manure, spading round it, pruning,\r\nand, indeed, remedial operations of every kind; nay, what is more, it\r\nis killed by irrigation, while, on the other hand, the vine and the\r\npomegranate receive their principal nutriment from it. In the fig,\r\nagain, the tree is nourished by watering, while the very same thing\r\nwill make the fruit pine and die: the almond, too, if the ground is\r\nspaded about it, will lose its blossom. In the same way, too, there\r\nmust be no digging about the roots of trees when newly grafted, or\r\nindeed until such time as they are sufficiently strong to bear. Many\r\ntrees require that all superfluous burdens should be pruned away from\r\nthem, just as we ourselves cut the nails and hair. Old trees are\r\noften cut down to the ground, and then shoot up again from one of the\r\nsuckers; this, however, is not the case with all of them, but only\r\nthose, the nature of which, as we have already stated,[3232] will admit\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—METHODS OF IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWatering is good for trees during the heats of summer, but injurious in\r\nwinter; the effects of it are of a varied nature in autumn, and depend\r\nupon the peculiar nature of the soil. Thus, in Spain for instance, the\r\nvintager gathers the grapes while the ground beneath is under water; on\r\nthe other hand, in most parts of the world, it is absolutely necessary\r\nto carry off the autumn rains by draining. It is about the rising of\r\nthe Dog-star that irrigation is so particularly beneficial; but even\r\nthen it ought not to be in excess, as the roots are apt to become\r\ninebriated, and to receive injury therefrom. Care should be taken,\r\ntoo, to proportion it to the age of the tree, young trees being not\r\nso thirsty as older ones; those too which require the most water, are\r\nthe ones that have been the most used to it. On the other hand, plants\r\nwhich grow in a dry soil, require no more moisture than is absolutely\r\nnecessary to their existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41.—REMARKABLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Fabian district, which belongs to the territory of Sulmo[3233]\r\nin Italy, where they are in the habit, also, of irrigating the fields,\r\nthe natural harshness of the wines makes it necessary to water the\r\nvineyards; it is a very singular thing, too, that the water there\r\nkills all the weeds, while at the same time it nourishes the corn,\r\nthus acting in place of the weeding-hook. In the same district, too,\r\nat the winter solstice, and more particularly when the snow is on the\r\nground or frosts prevail, they irrigate the land, a process which they\r\ncall “warming” the soil. This peculiarity, however, exists in the\r\nwater of one river[3234] only, the cold of which in summer is almost\r\ninsupportable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42. (27.)—INCISIONS MADE IN TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper remedies for charcoal-blight and mildew[3235] will be\r\npointed out in the succeeding Book.[3236] In the meantime, however,\r\nwe may here observe that among the remedies may be placed that by\r\nscarification.[3237] When the bark becomes meagre and impoverished by\r\ndisease, it is apt to shrink, and so compress the vital parts of the\r\ntree to an excessive degree: upon which, by means of a sharp pruning\r\nknife held with both hands, incisions are made perpendicularly down\r\nthe tree, and a sort of looseness, as it were, imparted to the skin.\r\nIt is a proof that the method has been adopted with success, when the\r\nfissures so made remain open and become filled with wood of the trunk\r\ngrowing between the lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—OTHER REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medical treatment of trees in a great degree resembles that of man,\r\nseeing that in certain cases the bones of them both are perforated\r\neven.[3238] The bitter almond will become sweet, if, after spading\r\nround the trunk and cleaning it, the lowermost part of it is pierced\r\nall round, so that the humours may have a passage for escape and ensure\r\nbeing removed. In the elm, too, the superfluous juices are drawn off,\r\nby piercing the tree above ground to the pith when it is old, or when\r\nit is found to suffer from an excess of nutriment. So, too, when\r\nthe bark of the fig is turgid and swollen, the confined juices are\r\ndischarged by means of light incisions made in a slanting direction;\r\nby the adoption of which method the fruit is prevented from falling\r\noff. When fruit-trees bud but bear no fruit, a fissure is made in the\r\nroot, and a stone inserted; the result of which is, that they become\r\nproductive.[3239] The same is done also with the almond, a wedge of\r\nrobur being employed for the purpose. For the pear and the service tree\r\na wedge of torch-wood is used, and then covered over with ashes and\r\nearth. It is even found of use, too, to make circular incisions around\r\nthe roots of the vine and fig, when the vegetation is too luxuriant,\r\nand then to throw ashes over the roots. A late crop of figs is ensured,\r\nif the first fruit is taken off when green and little larger than a\r\nbean; for it is immediately succeeded by fresh, which ripens at a\r\nlater period than usual. If the tops of each branch are removed from\r\nthe fig, just as it is beginning to put forth leaves, its strength and\r\nproductiveness are greatly increased. As to caprification, the effect\r\nof that is to ripen the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—CAPRIFICATION, AND PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH THE FIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is beyond all doubt that in caprification the green fruit gives\r\nbirth to a kind of gnat;[3240] for when they have taken flight, there\r\nare no seeds to be found within the fruit: from this it would appear\r\nthat the seeds have been transformed into these gnats. Indeed, these\r\ninsects are so eager to take their flight, that they mostly leave\r\nbehind them either a leg or a part of a wing on their departure. There\r\nis another species of gnat,[3241] too, that grows in the fig, which\r\nin its indolence and malignity strongly resembles the drone of the\r\nbee-hive, and shows itself a deadly enemy to the one that is of real\r\nutility; it is called centrina, and in killing the others it meets its\r\nown death.\r\n\r\nMoths, too, attack the seeds of the fig: the best plan of getting rid\r\nof them, is to bury a slip of mastich,[3242] turned upside down, in the\r\nsame trench. The fig, too, is rendered extremely productive[3243] by\r\nsoaking red earth in amurca, and laying it, with some manure, upon the\r\nroots of the tree, just as it is beginning to throw out leaves. Among\r\nthe wild figs, the black ones, and those which grow in rocky places,\r\nare the most esteemed, from the fact of the fruit containing the most\r\nseed. Caprification takes place most advantageously just after rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—ERRORS THAT MAY BE COMMITTED IN PRUNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, before everything, especial care should be taken that intended\r\nremedies are not productive of ill results; as these may arise from\r\neither remedial measures being applied in excess or at unseasonable\r\ntimes. Clearing away the branches is of the greatest benefit to trees,\r\nbut to slaughter[3244] them this way every year, is productive of the\r\nvery worst results. The vine is the only tree that requires lopping\r\nevery year, the myrtle, the pomegranate, and olive every other; the\r\nreason being that these trees shoot with great rapidity. The other\r\ntrees are lopped less frequently, and none of them in autumn; the trunk\r\neven is never scraped,[3245] except in spring. In pruning a tree,\r\nall that is removed beyond what is absolutely necessary, is so much\r\nwithdrawn from its vitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—THE PROPER MODE OF MANURING TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same precautions, too, are to be regarded in manuring. Though\r\nmanure is grateful to the tree, still it is necessary to be careful\r\nnot to apply it while the sun is hot, or while it is too new, or more\r\nstimulating than is absolutely necessary. The dung of swine will\r\nburn[3246] up the vine, if used at shorter intervals than those of\r\nfive years; unless, indeed, it is mixed with water. The same is the\r\ncase, too, with the refuse of the currier’s workshop, unless it is\r\nwell diluted with water: manure will scorch also, if laid on land too\r\nplentifully. It is generally considered the proper proportion, to use\r\nthree modii to every ten feet square; this, however, the nature of the\r\nsoil must decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—MEDICAMENTS FOR TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds and incisions of trees are treated also with pigeon dung and\r\nswine manure. If pomegranates are acid, the roots of the tree are\r\ncleared, and swine’s dung is applied to them: the result is, that\r\nin the first year the fruit will have a vinous flavour, but in the\r\nsucceeding one it will be sweet. Some persons are of opinion that the\r\npomegranate should be watered four times a year with a mixture of human\r\nurine and water, at the rate of an amphora to each tree; or else that\r\nthe extremities of the branches should be sprinkled with silphium[3247]\r\nsteeped in wine. The stalk of the pomegranate should be twisted, if it\r\nis found to split while on the tree. The fig, too, should be drenched\r\nwith the amurca of olives, and other trees when they are ailing,\r\nwith lees of wine; or else lupines may be sown about the roots. The\r\nwater, too, of a decoction of lupines is beneficial to the fruit, if\r\npoured upon the roots of the tree. When it thunders at the time of the\r\nVulcanalia,[3248] the figs fall off; the only remedy for which is to\r\nhave the area beneath ready covered with barley-straw. Lime applied to\r\nthe roots of the tree makes cherries come sooner to maturity, and ripen\r\nmore rapidly. The best plan, too, with the cherry, as with all other\r\nkinds, is to thin the fruit, so that that which is left behind may grow\r\nall the larger.\r\n\r\n(28.) There are some trees, again, which thrive all the better for\r\nbeing maltreated,[3249] or else are stimulated by pungent substances;\r\nthe palm and the mastich for instance, which derive nutriment from\r\nsalt water.[3250] Ashes have the same virtues as salt, only in a more\r\nmodified degree; for which reason it is, that fig-trees are sprinkled\r\nwith them; as also with rue,[3251] to keep away worms, and to prevent\r\nthe roots from rotting. What is still more even, it is recommended to\r\nthrow salt[3252] water on the roots of vines, if they are too full of\r\nhumours; and if the fruit falls off, to sprinkle them with ashes and\r\nvinegar, or with sandarach if the grapes are rotting.[3253] If, again,\r\na vine is not productive, it should be sprinkled and rubbed with strong\r\nvinegar and ashes; and if the grapes, instead of ripening, dry and\r\nshrivel up, the vine should be lopped near the roots,[3254] and the\r\nwound and fibres drenched with strong vinegar and stale urine; after\r\nwhich, the roots should be covered up with mud annealed with these\r\nliquids, and the ground spaded repeatedly.\r\n\r\nAs to the olive, if it gives promise of but little fruit, the roots\r\nshould be bared, and left exposed to the winter cold,[3255] a mode of\r\ntreatment for which it is all the better.\r\n\r\nAll these operations depend each year upon the state of the weather,\r\nand require to be sometimes retarded, and at other times precipitated.\r\nThe very element of fire even has its own utility, in the case of the\r\nreed for instance; which, after the reed-bed has been burnt, will\r\nspring up all the thicker and more pliable.[3256]\r\n\r\nCato,[3257] too, gives receipts for certain medicaments, specifying the\r\nproportions as well; for the roots of the large trees he prescribes\r\nan amphora, and for those of the smaller ones, an urna, of amurca of\r\nolives, mixed with water in equal proportions, recommending the roots\r\nto be cleared, and the mixture to be gradually poured upon them. In\r\naddition to this, in the case of the olive and the fig, he recommends\r\nthat a layer of straw should be first placed around them. In the\r\nfig, too, more particularly, he says that in spring the roots should\r\nbe well moulded up; the result of which is, that the fruit will not\r\nfall off while green, and the tree will be all the more productive,\r\nand not affected with roughness of the bark. In the same way,\r\ntoo,[3258] to prevent the vine-fretter[3259] from attacking the tree,\r\nhe recommends that two congii of amurca of olives should be boiled\r\ndown to the consistency of honey, after which it must be boiled again\r\nwith one-third part of bitumen, and one-fourth of sulphur; and this\r\nshould be done, he says, in the open air, for fear of its igniting if\r\nprepared in-doors; with this mixture, the vine is to be anointed at the\r\nends of the branches and at the axils; after which, no more fretters\r\nwill be seen. Some persons are content to make a fumigation with this\r\nmixture while the wind is blowing towards the vine, for three days in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nMany persons, again, attribute no less utility and nutritious virtue to\r\nurine than Cato does to amurca; only they add to it an equal proportion\r\nof water, it being injurious if employed by itself. Some give the name\r\nof “volucre”[3260] to an insect which eats away the young grapes: to\r\nprevent this, they rub the pruning-knife, every time it is sharpened,\r\nupon a beaver-skin, and then prune the tree with it: it is recommended\r\nalso, that after the pruning, the knife should be well rubbed with the\r\nblood of a bear.[3261] Ants, too, are a great pest to trees; they are\r\nkept away, however, by smearing the trunk with red earth and tar: if a\r\nfish, too, is hung up in the vicinity of the tree, these insects will\r\ncollect in that one spot. Another method, again, is to pound lupines\r\nin oil,[3262] and anoint the roots with the mixture. Many people kill\r\nboth ants as well as moles[3263] with amurca, and preserve apples from\r\ncaterpillars as well as from rotting, by touching the top of the tree\r\nwith the gall of a green lizard.\r\n\r\nAnother method, too, of preventing caterpillars, is to make a\r\nwoman,[3264] with her monthly courses on her, go round each tree,\r\nbarefooted and ungirt. Again, for the purpose of preventing animals\r\nfrom doing mischief by browsing upon the leaves, they should be\r\nsprinkled with cow-dung each time after rain, the showers having the\r\neffect of washing away the virtues of this application.\r\n\r\nThe industry of man has really made some very wonderful discoveries,\r\nand, indeed, has gone so far as to lead many persons to believe, that\r\nhail-storms may be averted by means of a certain charm, the words of\r\nwhich I really could not venture seriously to transcribe; although we\r\nfind that Cato[3265] has given those which are employed as a charm for\r\nsprained limbs, employing splints of reed in conjunction with it. The\r\nsame author,[3266] too, has allowed of consecrated trees and groves\r\nbeing cut down, after a sacrifice has first been offered: the form of\r\nprayer, and the rest of the proceedings, will be found fully set forth\r\nin the same work of his.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, eight\r\nhundred and eighty.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Cornelius Nepos,[3267] Cato[3268] the\r\nCensor, M.

If so, it must be the old Roman Libra, as it is more generally\r\nthought that the Libra of Pliny’s time contained ninety-six Denarii, of\r\nsixty grains, within a fraction.\r\n\r\n[2] One thousand Paces made a Roman “Mille Passuum,” or Mile, 1618\r\nyards English.\r\n\r\n[3] “Immensæ subtilitatis.” As Cuvier remarks, the ancients have\r\ncommitted more errors in reference to the insects, than to any other\r\nportion of the animal world. The discovery of the microscope has served\r\nmore than anything to correct these erroneous notions.\r\n\r\n[4] “Insecta,” “articulated.”\r\n\r\n[5] The trunk of the gnat, Cuvier says, contains five silken and\r\npointed threads, which together have the effect of a sting.\r\n\r\n[6] The Teredo navalis of Linnæus, not an insect, but one of the\r\nmollusks. This is the same creature that is mentioned in B. xvi. c. 80;\r\nbut that spoken of in B. viii. c. 74, must have been a land insect.\r\n\r\n[7] They respire by orifices in the sides of the body, known to\r\nnaturalists as _stigmata_. The whole body, Cuvier says, forms, in a\r\nmeasure, a system of lungs.\r\n\r\n[8] Cuvier remarks that the various noises made by insects are in\r\nreality not the voice, as they are not produced by air passing through\r\na larynx.\r\n\r\n[9] B. ix. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[10] Cuvier remarks, that they have a nourishing fluid, which is of a\r\nwhite colour, and acts in place of blood.\r\n\r\n[11] The dye of sæpia, Cuvier remarks, is not blood, nor does it act\r\nas such, being an excrementitious liquid. It has in addition a bluish,\r\ntransparent, blood. The same also with the juices of the purple.\r\n\r\n[12] “Nervos.” Cuvier says that all insects have a brain, a sort of\r\nspinal marrow, and nerves.\r\n\r\n[13] “Tutius.”\r\n\r\n[14] Insects have no fat, Cuvier says, except when in the chrysalis\r\nstate; but they have a fibrous flesh of a whitish colour. They have\r\nalso viscera, trachea, nerves, and a most complicated organization.\r\n\r\n[15] “Melligo.” For further information on this subject consult Bevan\r\non the Honey Bee.\r\n\r\n[16] Or “conusis,” “gummy matter.”\r\n\r\n[17] Pitch-wax.\r\n\r\n[18] A kind of bee-glue; the origin of the name does not seem to be\r\nknown.

Ropes were made\r\nof it. See B. xix. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[25] Or, the “wild man.”\r\n\r\n[26] Huber has discovered that there are two kinds of bees of neutral\r\nsex, or, as he calls them, unprolific females, the workers, which go\r\nout, and the nurses, which are smaller, and stay in the hive to tend\r\nthe larvæ.\r\n\r\n[27] From the honey found in the corollæ of flowers. This, after being\r\nprepared in the first stomach of the bee, is deposited in the cell\r\nwhich is formed for its reception.\r\n\r\n[28] Cuvier says that the three kinds of cells are absolutely\r\nnecessary, and that they do not depend on the greater or less\r\nabundance. The _king_ of the ancients is what we know as the _queen_\r\nbee, which is impregnated by the drones or males.\r\n\r\n[29] This is the fact, but not so their _imperfect_ state.\r\n\r\n[30] They do not work, but merely impregnate the queen; after which\r\nthey are driven from the hive, and perish of cold and starvation.\r\n\r\n[31] It appears, as Cuvier says, that the ancients had _some_ notion\r\nthat the swarm was multiplied by the aid of the drones.\r\n\r\n[32] Cuvier says that the cell for the future queen is different from\r\nthe others, and much larger. The bees also supply the queen larva much\r\nmore abundantly with food, and of more delicate quality.\r\n\r\n[33] Cuvier says that this coincidence with the number of the legs is\r\nquite accidental, as it is with the mouth that the animal constructs\r\nthe cell.\r\n\r\n[34] The basis of it is really derived from the calix or corolla of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n[35] See B. iv. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[36] In the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[37] Or “Flower-honey.”\r\n\r\n[38] Season-honey.\r\n\r\n[39] “Vinegar” is the ordinary meaning.\r\n\r\n[40] Sillig remarks that the whole of this passage is corrupt.\r\n\r\n[41] Hence, perhaps, its name of “acetum.”\r\n\r\n[42] The people of Italy.\r\n\r\n[43] The 10th of the calends of September, or 23rd August.\r\n\r\n[44] Or “heath-honey.” In the north of England the hives are purposely\r\ntaken to the moors.\r\n\r\n[45] “Erice,” “heather,” seems to be a preferable reading to “myrice,”\r\n“tamarisk,” which is adopted by Sillig.\r\n\r\n[46] 12th September.\r\n\r\n[47] “Tetralicem” seems preferable to “tamaricem.”\r\n\r\n[48] 13th November.\r\n\r\n[49] “Unsmoked” honey.\r\n\r\n[50] It takes place while they are on the wing.\r\n\r\n[51] The only prolific _female_, in reality.\r\n\r\n[52] Some unprolific females and some males, in reality.\r\n\r\n[53] Cuvier thinks that either hornets, or else the drones, must be\r\nalluded to. Virgil, Georg. B. iv. l. 197, _et seq._, is one of those\r\nwho think that bees are produced from flowers.\r\n\r\n[54] _I. e._ from flowers.\r\n\r\n[55] They arrange the eggs in the cells, but they cannot be said to\r\n_sit_.\r\n\r\n[56] This is not the fact. The queen bee commences as a larva, and that\r\nthe larva of a working bee, Cuvier says, which, placed in a larger\r\ncell, and nurtured in a different manner, developes its sex and becomes\r\nthe queen of the new swarm.\r\n\r\n[57] They are then in the chrysalis state.\r\n\r\n[58] “Clavus.”\r\n\r\n[59] It is the first hatched _queen_ that puts the others to death.\r\n\r\n[60] In consequence, really, of their pregnancy.\r\n\r\n[61] The greater size of the abdomen makes the wings _look_ shorter.\r\n\r\n[62] The queen has a sting, like the working bees, but uses it less\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\n[63] A place in Germany, where Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, gained\r\na victory over the Germans: the locality is unknown.\r\n\r\n[64] “Fur.” A variety, probably, of the drone.\r\n\r\n[65] So Virgil says—\r\n\r\n    ——“Hæc certamina tanta Pulveris exigui jactu compressa\r\n  quiescent.”—_Georg._ iv. 87.\r\n\r\n[66] If it is left in the wound, the insect dies, being torn asunder.\r\n\r\n[67] Of course this is fabulous, as the drones are males.\r\n\r\n[68] Though belonging to the same class, they are not of degenerate\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n[69] The “mule-gnat.”\r\n\r\n[70] See Virgil, Georg. B. iv. l. 27.\r\n\r\n[71] The reading seems doubtful, and the meaning is probably unknown.\r\n\r\n[72] “Injury of the young.”\r\n\r\n[73] There are two kinds of hive-moth—the Phalæna tinea mellanella of\r\nLinnæus, and the Phalæna tortrix cereana. It deposits its larva in\r\nholes which it makes in the wax.\r\n\r\n[74] In consequence of closing the stigmata, and so impeding their\r\nrespiration. The same result, no doubt, is produced by the honey when\r\nsmeared over their bodies.\r\n\r\n[75] B. xxi. c. 42.\r\n\r\n[76] Cuvier says that a hive has been known to last more than thirty\r\nyears: but it is doubtful if bees ever live so long as ten, or, except\r\nthe queen, little more than one.\r\n\r\n[77] Though Virgil tells the same story, in B. iv. of the Georgics, in\r\nrelation to the shepherd Aristæus, all this is entirely fabulous.\r\n\r\n[78] Georg. B. iv. l. 284, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[79] Under roofs, and sometimes in the ground: hornets build in the\r\nhollows of trees.\r\n\r\n[80] Called “Sphæx” by Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[81] The true version is, that after killing the insect they bury it\r\nwith their eggs as food for their future young.\r\n\r\n[82] Cuvier says that it is the males, and not the females, that have\r\nno sting.\r\n\r\n[83] What modern naturalists call the “Hymenoptera.”\r\n\r\n[84] Some kind of wasp, or, as Cuvier says, probably the mason bee.\r\n\r\n[85] Called “bombyx” also; though, as Cuvier remarks, of a kind\r\naltogether different from the preceding one.\r\n\r\n[86] The first kinds of silk dresses worn by the Roman ladies were\r\nfrom this island, and, as Pliny says, were known by the name of _Coæ\r\nvestes_. These dresses were so fine as to be transparent, and were\r\nsometimes dyed purple, and enriched with stripes of gold. They probably\r\nhad their name from the early reputation which Cos acquired by its\r\nmanufactures of silk.\r\n\r\n[87] This account is derived from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. v. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[88] “Lanificia.”\r\n\r\n[89] Early in the reign of Tiberius, as we learn from Tacitus, the\r\nsenate enacted “ne vestis Serica viros fædaret”—“That men should not\r\ndefile themselves by wearing garments of silk,” Ann. B. ii. c. 33.\r\n\r\n[90] The Aranea lupus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[91] As Cuvier observes, he has here guessed at the truth.\r\n\r\n[92] They copulate in a manner dissimilar to that of any other\r\ninsects—the male fecundates the female by the aid of feelers, which he\r\nintroduces into the vulva of the female situate beneath the anterior\r\npart of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n[93] Cuvier remarks, that the scorpion is viviparous; but the young are\r\nwhite when born, and wrapped up in an oval mass, for which reason they\r\nmay easily be taken for maggots or grubs.\r\n\r\n[94] This must be understood of the scorpion of Egypt, Libya, and\r\nSyria. The sting of that of the south of Europe is not generally\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n[95] Cuvier seems to regard this as fanciful: he says that the\r\ninstances of _seven_ joints are but rarely to be met with.\r\n\r\n[96] There are no winged scorpions. Cuvier thinks that he may possibly\r\nallude to the panorpis, or scorpion-fly, the abdomen of which\r\nterminates in a forceps, which resembles the tail of the scorpion.\r\n\r\n[97] Probably the panorpis.\r\n\r\n[98] See B. xxix. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[99] The starred or spotted lizard.\r\n\r\n[100] The stellio of the Romans is the “ascalabos” or “ascalabotes” of\r\nthe Greeks, the lizard into which Ascalabus was changed by Ceres: see\r\nOvid, Met. B. v. l. 450, _et seq._ Pliny also mentions this in B. xxix.\r\nc. 4, though he speaks of some difference in their appearance. It is\r\na species of gecko, the tarentola of Italy, the tarente of Provence,\r\nand the geckotta, probably, of Lacepède. The gecko, Cuvier says, is\r\nnot venomous; but it causes small blisters to rise on the skin when it\r\nwalks over it, the result, probably, of the extreme sharpness of its\r\nnails.\r\n\r\n[101] See c. 28 of this Book, and B. viii. c. 95; B. xxx. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[102] A general name for the grasshopper. Cuvier remarks, that Pliny is\r\nless clear on this subject than Aristotle, the author from whom he has\r\nborrowed.\r\n\r\n[103] “Correptis” seems a preferable reading to “conrupti,” that\r\nadopted by Sillig.\r\n\r\n[104] The female has this, and employs it for piercing dead branches in\r\nwhich to deposit its eggs.\r\n\r\n[105] The “mother of the grasshopper.”\r\n\r\n[106] The trunk of the grasshopper, Cuvier says, is situate so low\r\ndown, that it seems to be attached to the breast. With it the insect\r\nextracts the juices of leaves and stalks.\r\n\r\n[107] Or “twig-grasshopper.”\r\n\r\n[108] Or “corn-grasshopper.”\r\n\r\n[109] Or “oat-grasshopper.”\r\n\r\n[110] The river Cæcina. See B. iii. c. 15. This river is by Strabo,\r\nB. vi. c. 260, called the Alex. Ælian has the story that the Locrian\r\ngrasshoppers become silent in the territory of Rhegium, and those of\r\nRhegium in the territory of Locri, thereby implying that they each have\r\na note in its own respective country.\r\n\r\n[111] Cuvier says that the observations in this Chapter, derived from\r\nAristotle, are remarkable for their exactness, and show that that\r\nphilosopher had studied insects with the greatest attention.\r\n\r\n[112] Or sheath; the Coleoptera of the naturalists.\r\n\r\n[113] The flying stag-beetle, the Lucanus cervus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[114] The dung-beetle, the Scarabæus pilularius of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[115] Various kinds of crickets.\r\n\r\n[116] Cuvier says that it is on the two sides of the abdomen that the\r\nmale carries its light, while the whole posterior part of the female is\r\nshining.\r\n\r\n[117] In the glow-worm of France, the Lampyris noctiluca of Linnæus,\r\nthe female is without wings, while the male gives but little light. In\r\nthat of Italy, the Lampyris Italica, both sexes are winged.\r\n\r\n[118] “Blattæ.” See B. xxix. c. 39, where three kinds are specified.\r\n\r\n[119] This beetle appears to be unknown. Cuvier suggests that the\r\nScarabæus nasicornis of Linnæus, which haunts dead bark, or the\r\nScarabæus auratus may be the insect referred to.\r\n\r\n[120] “Fatal to the beetle.”\r\n\r\n[121] Cuvier remarks that this assertion, borrowed from Aristotle, is\r\nincorrect. The wings of many of the Coleoptera are articulated in the\r\nmiddle, and so double, one part on the other, to enter the sheath.\r\n\r\n[122] Cuvier remarks, that the panorpis has a tail very like that of\r\nthe scorpion; and that the ephemera, the ichneumons and others, have\r\ntails also. Aristotle, in the corresponding place, only says that the\r\ninsects do not use the tail to direct their flight.\r\n\r\n[123] These are merely the feelers of the jaws.\r\n\r\n[124] Not instead of, but in addition to, the tongue, by the aid of\r\nwhich they suck.\r\n\r\n[125] Evidently meaning the trunk.\r\n\r\n[126] See B. xxix. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[127] It is not true that the young locusts are destitute of feet.\r\n\r\n[128] 7th May.\r\n\r\n[129] 18th July.\r\n\r\n[130] 11th May.\r\n\r\n[131] Cuvier treats this story as purely imaginary.\r\n\r\n[132] Cuvier says that some have been known nearly a foot long, but not\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n[133] He alludes to the ravages committed by the swarms of the\r\nmigratory locust, Grillus migratorius of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[134] Julius Obsequens speaks of a pestilence there, created by the\r\ndead bodies of the locusts, which caused the death of 8000 persons.\r\n\r\n[135] See also B. vi. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[136] What are commonly called ants’ eggs, are in reality their larvæ\r\nand nymphæ. Enveloped in a sort of tunic, these last, Cuvier says,\r\nare like grains of corn, and from this probably has arisen the story\r\nthat they lay up grains against the winter, a period through which in\r\nreality they do not eat.\r\n\r\n[137] They stow away bits of meat and detached portions of fruit, to\r\nnourish their larvæ with their juices.\r\n\r\n[138] It is in reality their larvæ that they thus bring out to dry. The\r\nworking ants, or neutrals, are the ones on which these labours devolve:\r\nthe males and females are winged, the working ants are without wings.\r\n\r\n[139] “Ad recognitionem mutuam.”\r\n\r\n[140] Some modern writers express an opinion that when they meet, they\r\nconverse and encourage one another by the medium of touch and smell.\r\n\r\n[141] See B. v. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[142] M. de Veltheim thinks that by this is really meant the Canis\r\ncorsac, the small fox of India, but that by some mistake it was\r\nrepresented by travellers as an ant. It is not improbable, Cuvier\r\nsays, that some quadruped, in making holes in the ground, may have\r\noccasionally thrown up some grains of the precious metal. The story\r\nis derived from the narratives of Clearchus and Megasthenes. Another\r\ninterpretation of this story has also been suggested. We find from\r\nsome remarks of Mr. Wilson, in the _Transactions of the Asiatic\r\nSociety_, on the Mahabharata, a Sanscrit poem, that various tribes on\r\nthe mountains Meru and Mandara (supposed to lie between Hindostan and\r\nTibet) used to sell grains of gold, which they called _paippilaka_, or\r\n“ant-gold,” which, they said, was thrown up by ants, in Sanscrit called\r\n_pippilaka_. In travelling westward, this story, in itself, no doubt,\r\nuntrue, may very probably have been magnified to its present dimensions.\r\n\r\n[143] Cuvier observes, that this is a very correct account of the\r\ncabbage or radish butterfly, the Papilio brassicæ or Papilio raphani of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\n[144] Cossi. See B. xvii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[145] Tæniæ.\r\n\r\n[146] He alludes to the Morbus pediculosus.\r\n\r\n[147] Aristotle says, in the corresponding passage, Hist. Anim. B.\r\nv. c. 26, that the animals which are affected by lice, are more\r\nparticularly exposed to them when they change the water in which they\r\nwash.\r\n\r\n[148] Or “leapers.”\r\n\r\n[149] He alludes to dog-ticks and ox-ticks, the Acarus ricinus of\r\nLinnæus, and the Acarus reduvius of Schrank.\r\n\r\n[150] In c. 32 he has said the same of the grasshopper; in relation to\r\nits drink.\r\n\r\n[151] A variety of the Cynips of Linnæus, which in vast numbers will\r\nsometimes adhere to the ears of dogs.\r\n\r\n[152] These are really the larvæ of night-moths. His account here is\r\npurely imaginary.\r\n\r\n[153] He speaks of the Cynips psenes of Linnæus, which breeds on the\r\nblossom of the fig-tree, and aids in its fecundation. See B. xv. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[154] He alludes to various coleopterous insects, which are not\r\nincluded among the Cantharides of the modern naturalists. They are\r\nfirst an egg, then a larva, then a nympha, and then the insect fully\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n[155] See B. xxix. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[156] The redness sometimes observed on the snow of the Alps and the\r\nPyrenees, is supposed by De Lamarck to be produced by animalculæ: other\r\nnaturalists, however, suppose it to arise from vegetable or mineral\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n[157] Cuvier thinks that he alludes to a variety of the ephemera or\r\nthe phryganea of Linnæus, the case-wing flies, many of which are\r\nparticularly short-lived. These are by no means peculiar to the river\r\nBog or Hypanis.\r\n\r\n[158] “Living for a day.”\r\n\r\n[159] They only _appear_ to be so, from the peculiar streaks on the\r\neyes. Linnæus has hence called one variety, the Tabanus cæcutiens.\r\n\r\n[160] Or with pounded chalk or whitening. Ælian adds, “if they are\r\nplaced in the sun,” which appears necessary for the full success of the\r\nexperiment. Life appears to be suspended in such cases for a period of\r\nsurprising length.\r\n\r\n[161] Probably the golden pheasant, as already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[162] Some kind of heron or crane, Cuvier thinks.\r\n\r\n[163] The Alauda cristata of Linnæus, so called from “galera,” a\r\npointed cap like a helmet.\r\n\r\n[164] The fifth legion.\r\n\r\n[165] The hoopoe, B. x. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[166] Savigny and Cuvier take this to be the Ardea virgo of Linnæus, a\r\nnative of Numidia.\r\n\r\n[167] The suddenness of their appearance, no doubt, was fabulous; but\r\nwe have well-authenticated cases in recent times of substances growing\r\non the human head, to all appearance resembling horns, and arising from\r\na disordered secretion of the hair. Witness the case of Mary Davies,\r\na so-called horn from whose head is preserved in the Ashmolean Museum\r\nat Oxford. The story of Genucius Cippus, the Roman prætor, is told by\r\nOvid, Met. B. xv. l. 565, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[168] A spitter, or second year stag, according to Cuvier.\r\n\r\n[169] “Broad-horned.” The Cervus dama of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[170] “Dama.” The Antelope redunca of Linnæus, Cuvier thinks.\r\n\r\n[171] No doubt a kind of antelope.\r\n\r\n[172] “Lyras” seems preferable to “liras.”\r\n\r\n[173] There are several varieties of oxen, in which the horns adhere to\r\nthe skin, and not to the cranium.\r\n\r\n[174] B. viii. cc. 29-31.\r\n\r\n[175] The Coluber cerastes of Linnæus. See B. viii. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[176] The drinking-horns of our Saxon ancestors are well known to the\r\nantiquarian.\r\n\r\n[177] The “urna” was half an “amphora,” or nearly three gallons.\r\n\r\n[178] See B. xxxv. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[179] The rhinoceros. See B. viii. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[180] He surely must except the Phrygian oxen with the moveable horns,\r\nwhich he has previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[181] Or “long-haired.” See B. iii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[182] See B. iv. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[183] See B. iv. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[184] See B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[185] Φαλακροκόραξ. See B. x. c. 68.\r\n\r\n[186] He borrows this from Aristotle.\r\n\r\n[187] B. viii. c. 54, and B. x. c. 58. The skull of the bear is not\r\nthinner or weaker than that of other animals of its own size; but\r\nthe skull of the parrot, in proportion to those of other birds, is\r\nremarkably hard.\r\n\r\n[188] See B. vii. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[189] Cuvier says that these are the larvæ of the œstrus, which are\r\ndeposited on the lips of quadrupeds, and so make their way to various\r\ncavities.\r\n\r\n[190] B. ix. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[191] Or razor-sheath. See B. x. c. 88.\r\n\r\n[192] Aristotle was of this opinion, but Galen maintained that the mole\r\n_can_ see. Its eye is extremely small, and hard on the surface.\r\n\r\n[193] Or “white” heron. As Cuvier remarks, this is probably a mere\r\naugur’s fable.\r\n\r\n[194] It is almost needless to remark, that both snails, as well as\r\nlocusts and grasshoppers, _have_ eyes.\r\n\r\n[195] Lumbricus.\r\n\r\n[196] B. vii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[197] “Cæsii.”\r\n\r\n[198] The same has been said also of Cardan, the elder Scaliger,\r\nTheodore Beza, the French physician Mairan, and the republican Camille\r\nDesmoulins.\r\n\r\n[199] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[200] Hardouin with justice doubts the soundness of this alleged reason.\r\n\r\n[201] He alludes, probably, to some method of curing cataract; perhaps\r\nsomewhat similar to that mentioned by him in B. xx. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[202] This was done by the nearest relatives. This usage still prevails\r\nin this country, the eyelids being pressed down with pieces of gold or\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n[203] Or “squint-eyed.”\r\n\r\n[204] Or “cock-eyed.”\r\n\r\n[205] B. viii. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[206] B. viii, c. 51.\r\n\r\n[207] See B. xxv. c. 50.\r\n\r\n[208] Or crustaceous covering.\r\n\r\n[209] Kohl is still used in the east for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n[210] Aristotle says so, Hist. Anim. B. iii. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[211] “The eyebrows.”\r\n\r\n[212] This is not the fact.\r\n\r\n[213] With their nails when mourning for the dead.\r\n\r\n[214] Hence the word “nasutus,” a sneering, captious, or sarcastic man.\r\n\r\n[215] “Flat-nosed,” and “snub-nosed.”\r\n\r\n[216] A Roman family—the reading of this word seems doubtful.\r\n\r\n[217] In reality, the under one only.\r\n\r\n[218] He is incorrect in speaking of dogs as having serrated teeth.\r\n\r\n[219] In the dugong also, babiroussa, muntjac, and others.\r\n\r\n[220] The morse and the dugong are instances to the contrary.\r\n\r\n[221] The females of the elephant, morse, dugong, chevrotin, and\r\nmuntjac have them, and they are equally as useful as with the male,\r\nonly, perhaps, not so strong.\r\n\r\n[222] This is incorrect, unless he merely means ranged in one\r\ncontinuous line; and even then he is in error.\r\n\r\n[223] See B. ix. c. 29. This is called the parrot-fish, from the\r\nresemblance of its upper and lower jaws to the beak of a parrot.\r\n\r\n[224] They present this appearance from being worn away at the surface.\r\n\r\n[225] Rondelet would read “gula,” the throat. This, though repudiated\r\nby Hardouin, is approved of by Cuvier, who justly looks upon the\r\nordinary reading as an absurdity. Many fish, he says, and more\r\nespecially the osseous ones, have teeth in the pharynx.\r\n\r\n[226] There is always one fang, at least, ready to supply the place of\r\nthe one in front, if lost by any accident.\r\n\r\n[227] Like the jugglers of the East at the present day. But it is very\r\ndoubtful whether the poison fang is in _all_ instances previously\r\nextracted from the serpents which they handle.\r\n\r\n[228] But the camel, as well as the lama, has an incisive bone,\r\nprovided with an incisive tooth on each side, and has canine and molar\r\nteeth as well.\r\n\r\n[229] If by this term he means teeth separated from each other,\r\nthe assertion is incorrect, as in these animals we find the molars\r\nseparated from the lower incisives by a very considerable space.\r\n\r\n[230] Cuvier says, as far as the sea-urchin is concerned, very simply,\r\nand merely by looking at it, as its five teeth are very apparent.\r\n\r\n[231] The incisors are in number, and very nearly in appearance, like\r\nthose of man. The canines are different in shape, though similar in\r\nnumber. What he says about the elephant, is peculiar to that of India.\r\n\r\n[232] See B. ix. c. 88.\r\n\r\n[233] Very few other animals are born with teeth, in their natural\r\nstate. Apes, dogs, and cats are not born with teeth.\r\n\r\n[234] From the fourth to the eighth month in reality, during which the\r\nfour central incisors appear.\r\n\r\n[235] The only ones that do not change are those which have three\r\nmolars on each side of the jaw.\r\n\r\n[236] This is erroneous: they change the incisors and molars as well.\r\n\r\n[237] See B. xxviii. c. 78.\r\n\r\n[238] By us known as the “wisdom” teeth.\r\n\r\n[239] This is not the fact: they have usually the same number, but\r\nthere are exceptions on both sides. The same is also the case with\r\nsheep, goats, and swine.\r\n\r\n[240] This is not very uncommon.\r\n\r\n[241] Not at all an uncommon occurrence.\r\n\r\n[242] Of the second set.\r\n\r\n[243] It is only in the horse and the ass that these indications can be\r\nrelied upon.\r\n\r\n[244] Columellares.\r\n\r\n[245] This has no such effect.\r\n\r\n[246] The contrary is the case: it will be more prolific.\r\n\r\n[247] Swine change them just the same as other animals.\r\n\r\n[248] By certain appearances in the incisors, the age of a horse up to\r\nits twenty-fourth year, or even beyond, may be judged of: the other\r\nsigns cannot be so positively relied upon.\r\n\r\n[249] B. viii. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[250] “Sævissima dentibus,” seems to be a preferable reading to\r\n“sævissime dentiunt.”\r\n\r\n[251] Only two-forked in reality.\r\n\r\n[252] It is _not_ covered with hair.\r\n\r\n[253] It is _not_ bifurcate.\r\n\r\n[254] These are horny, conical papillæ, the summits of which point\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\n[255] See B. ix. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[256] “Criers.”\r\n\r\n[257] One of the titles of the goddess Fortuna.\r\n\r\n[258] “Uva,” or “grape.”\r\n\r\n[259] More generally “epiglottis.” It is found in some few reptiles.\r\nThis passage is omitted by Sillig.\r\n\r\n[260] Gullet, or pharynx.\r\n\r\n[261] Stomachum.\r\n\r\n[262] All these animals, on the contrary, have seven vertebræ.\r\n\r\n[263] This is not the fact. The spinal marrow, even, may be wounded,\r\nwithout death being the immediate result.\r\n\r\n[264] Snow-water, we know, is apt to produce goitre.\r\n\r\n[265] “Stomachus.” More properly, the œsophagus, or ventricle.\r\n\r\n[266] Lacunæ modo.\r\n\r\n[267] Or turtle. It has a tongue, and though it has no teeth, the jaws\r\nare edged with a horny substance like the bills of birds.\r\n\r\n[268] “Crenis” is read for “renis:” otherwise the passage is\r\nunintelligible: it is still most probably in a corrupt state.\r\n\r\n[269] Among all the mammiferæ and the birds, the heart has four\r\ncavities, two on each side.\r\n\r\n[270] Mens.\r\n\r\n[271] This is a mistake. The heart is subject to disease, equally with\r\nother parts of the body.\r\n\r\n[272] In spite of what Schenkius says in confirmation of Pliny, this\r\nis very doubtful. Of course it must increase from childhood, but the\r\nincrease surely does not continue till the fiftieth year.\r\n\r\n[273] See an account of him in the Messeniaca of Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[274] In this part of the story may have originated that of the escape\r\nof Sindbad the Sailor, when buried in the vault with the body of his\r\nwife.—See the “Arabian Nights.”\r\n\r\n[275] “Rex Sacrorum.” This was a priest elected from the patricians, on\r\nwhom the priestly duties devolved, which had been originally performed\r\nby the kings of Rome. He ranked above the Pontifex Maximus, but was\r\npossessed of little or no political influence.\r\n\r\n[276] No doubt there was trickery in this.\r\n\r\n[277] By supernatural agency.\r\n\r\n[278] This was P. Vitellius, who served under Germanicus in Germany.\r\nHe was one of the accusers of Cn. Piso, who was charged with having\r\npoisoned Germanicus.\r\n\r\n[279] The cardiac disease, as alleged.\r\n\r\n[280] B. ix. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[281] But see B. viii. c. 51, and B. xxviii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[282] Plutarch says that it was the “caput,” or “head” of the liver\r\nthat was wanting. M. Marcellus was slain while reconnoitring the\r\nCarthaginian camp by night.\r\n\r\n[283] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[284] 1st of January.\r\n\r\n[285] By his niece and wife, Agrippina, the mother of Nero.\r\n\r\n[286] See B. iv. c. 11. Tharne does not seem to be known. Of course,\r\nthis story about the hares is fabulous.\r\n\r\n[287] There must be some corrupt reading here; for, as Sillig remarks,\r\nwho ever heard of a siege which lasted a hundred years?\r\n\r\n[288] Or diaphragm; from “præ,” “before,” and “cor,” the “heart.”\r\n\r\n[289] With Sardonic laughter, as Hardouin remarks.\r\n\r\n[290] Or small guts.\r\n\r\n[291] Or front intestines.\r\n\r\n[292] The coot, probably.\r\n\r\n[293] He alludes to the papillæ of the mucous gland.\r\n\r\n[294] The colic.\r\n\r\n[295] “Lupus cervarius.” Probably the lynx.\r\n\r\n[296] The belly of the elephant presents five transversal folds.\r\n\r\n[297] See B. xxviii. c. 77. This substance, known by the name of\r\negagropile, consists of the hair which the animal has swallowed when\r\nlicking itself. It assumes a round form, in consequence of the action\r\nof the intestines.\r\n\r\n[298] Perhaps the godwit, or stone-plover, the Scolopax ægocephala of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\n[299] See also B. xxvi. c. 83.\r\n\r\n[300] This may be done with safety in dogs or other animals.\r\n\r\n[301] See B. v. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[302] See p. 68.\r\n\r\n[303] This is not the case. Birds have kidneys, but of an irregular\r\nform.\r\n\r\n[304] This is a mistake. It _does_ cicatrize.\r\n\r\n[305] Or bag.\r\n\r\n[306] “The (principal) place.”\r\n\r\n[307] Ajasson renders this passage: “The effects are fatal when this\r\norgan, becoming displaced, absorbs the air.” The text is probably\r\ncorrupt.\r\n\r\n[308] Varro, De Re Rust. B. ii. c. 4, says that he saw an instance of\r\nthis in Arcadia.\r\n\r\n[309] This is not the case.\r\n\r\n[310] There is no similarity whatever between the spinal marrow and\r\nthat which is found in the other bones.\r\n\r\n[311] The hare and the partridge, for instance.\r\n\r\n[312] There is considerable doubt what the ancients exactly meant\r\nby the “nervi;” and whether, in fact, they had any definite idea of\r\n“nerves,” in our acceptation of the word. Pliny here expresses the\r\nopinions entertained by Aristotle. “Tendons,” or “sinews,” would almost\r\nappear to be the proper translation of the word.\r\n\r\n[313] See B. xxviii. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[314] In allusion, probably, to hæmorrhoids, or piles.\r\n\r\n[315] See B. vii. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[316] Bears, dormice, serpents, &c.\r\n\r\n[317] The polypus and the chameleon.\r\n\r\n[318] See B. viii. cc. 51, 52.\r\n\r\n[319] Walking-sticks are still made of it.\r\n\r\n[320] As already mentioned, this is not the fact.\r\n\r\n[321] See B. ix. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[322] It is not improbable that, under this name, some kind of large\r\nvampire bat was meant; but, as Pliny says, it is impossible to arrive\r\nat any certain knowledge on the subject. The best account given of the\r\nstrix is that in Ovid’s Fasti, B. vi. The name was given opprobriously\r\nto supposed witches, the “foul and midnight hags” of Shakspeare.\r\n\r\n[323] This assertion is borrowed from Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. vii. c.\r\n14.\r\n\r\n[324] Or biestings.\r\n\r\n[325] See B. xxviii. c. 12. Poppæa Sabina, first the mistress, then the\r\nwife, of the Emperor Nero.\r\n\r\n[326] “Spuma.” He calls it so, because it floats on the surface. See B.\r\nxxviii. c. 35. The “acor,” or acrid liquid, which he speaks of, is, no\r\ndoubt, butter-milk.\r\n\r\n[327] Or whey.\r\n\r\n[328] Nismes, in France. Hardouin speaks of goats’-milk cheeses made in\r\nits neighbourhood, and known as _fromages de Baux_.\r\n\r\n[329] Probably the modern Losere and Gevaudan. See B. iv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[330] For the Docleatæ, see B. iii. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[331] For the Centrones, see B. iii. c. 24. He perhaps refers to the\r\nmodern _fromage de Passi_.\r\n\r\n[332] The modern Marquisat de Cive, which still produces excellent\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n[333] See B. xiv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[334] And more especially at Salona in Bithynia.\r\n\r\n[335] “Etiam ubi non videtur major.” This is probably corrupt.\r\n\r\n[336] He wrote a poem, in which the principal Latin dramatists are\r\nenumerated, in the order of merit. A. Gellius, B. xv. c. 24, has\r\npreserved a portion of it.\r\n\r\n[337] Germanicus.\r\n\r\n[338] This seems to be the meaning of “imbricatus.”\r\n\r\n[339] Though wounds in the knee are highly dangerous, death does not\r\n_necessarily_ ensue.\r\n\r\n[340] Of another person, who had thus forfeited his bail. It was the\r\ncustom to touch the ear of the attesting witness.\r\n\r\n[341] The goddess of retribution. See B. xxviii. c. 5, where he makes\r\nfurther mention of her statue in the Capitol.\r\n\r\n[342] The frog is, in some measure, an exception.\r\n\r\n[343] Or “flat-foot,” “splay-foot,” “large-foot,” and “club-footed.”\r\n\r\n[344] Words meaning “knock-kneed,” “bow-legged,” and “wry-legged.”\r\n\r\n[345] The rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n[346] Or wryneck.\r\n\r\n[347] See B. x. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[348] Supposed to be the Hirundo apus of Linnæus. Of the “oce” nothing\r\nis known; indeed, the reading is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[349] B. ix. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[350] He evidently means insects of the centipede class. See B. xxix.\r\nc. 39.\r\n\r\n[351] B. x. c. 83.\r\n\r\n[352] Such as circumcision among the Jews.\r\n\r\n[353] See B. xxxv. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[354] Probably the buzzard; from this story also called the “triorchis.”\r\n\r\n[355] Hist.

And yet Dalechamps would read “hominum”\r\ninstead of “numinum”!\r\n\r\n[425] Præmissa. The exact meaning of this word does not appear. Though\r\nall the MSS. agree in it, it is probably a corrupt reading. Plutarch,\r\nin his Life of Camillus, says that the wine of Italy was first\r\nintroduced in Gaul by Aruns, the Etruscan.\r\n\r\n[426] The Platanus orientalis of Linnæus. It received its name from the\r\nGreek πλάτος, “breadth,” by reason of its wide-spreading branches.\r\n\r\n[427] For further mention of this island, now Tremiti, see B. iii. c.\r\n30.\r\n\r\n[428] He alludes, probably, to the “vectigal solarium,” a sort of\r\nground-rent which the tributary nations paid to the Roman treasury.\r\nVirgil and Homer speak of the shade of the plane-tree, as a pleasant\r\nresort for festive parties.\r\n\r\n[429] It is not improbable that Pliny, in copying from Theophrastus,\r\nhas here committed an error. That author, B. ix. c. 7, says: ἐν μὲν\r\nγὰρ τῷ Ἀδρίᾳ πλάτανον οὔ φασιν εἶναι, πλὴν περὶ τὸ Διομήδους ἱερόν·\r\nσπανίαν δὲ καὶ ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ πάσῃ. “They say that in Adria there are no\r\nplane-trees, except about the temple of Diomedes: and that they are\r\nextremely rare in Italy.” Pliny, probably, when his secretary was\r\nreading to him, mistook the word σπανίαν, “rare,” for Ἱσπανίᾳ “in\r\nSpain.”\r\n\r\n[430] It has been remarked that, in reality, this process would only\r\ntend to impede its growth. Macrobius tells us, that Hortensius was\r\nguilty of this singular folly.\r\n\r\n[431] Situate near the sea-shore. It was here that Plato taught. See B.\r\nxxxi. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[432] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[433] It is supposed that he here alludes sarcastically to the extreme\r\ncorpulence of Caligula.\r\n\r\n[434] M. Fée, the learned editor of the botanical books in Ajasson’s\r\ntranslation, remarks, that this cannot have been the Platanus of the\r\nbotanists, and that there is no tree of Europe, which does not lose its\r\nleaves, that at all resembles it.\r\n\r\n[435] The tendency, namely, to lose their leaves.\r\n\r\n[436] Grandson of Asinius Pollio. Tacitus tells us, that he was one of\r\nthose whom Piso requested to undertake his defence, when charged with\r\nhaving poisoned Germanicus; but he declined the office.\r\n\r\n[437] Or “ground plane-trees.” It is by no means uncommon to see dwarf\r\nvarieties of the larger trees, which are thus reduced to the dimensions\r\nof mere shrubs.\r\n\r\n[438] C. Matius Calvena, the friend of Julius and Augustus Cæsar, as\r\nalso of Cicero. He is supposed to have translated the Iliad into Latin\r\nverse, and to have written a work on cookery.\r\n\r\n[439] See B. xxiii. c. 55. Fée remarks, that the ancients confounded\r\nthe citron with the orange-tree.\r\n\r\n[440] Fée remarks, that this is not the case. The arbute is described\r\nin B. xv. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[441] In the time of Plutarch, it had begun to be somewhat more used.\r\nIt makes one of the very finest preserves.\r\n\r\n[442] At the present day, it is cultivated all over India, in China,\r\nSouth America, and the southern parts of Europe. Fée says, that they\r\ngrow even in the open air in the gardens of Malmaison.\r\n\r\n[443] B. xi. c. 115. Virgil says the same, Georg. B. ii. ll. 134, 135.\r\nTheophrastus seems to say, that it was the outer rind that was so used.\r\n\r\n[444] See B. vi. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[445] See B. vii. c. 2. The tree to which he alludes is unknown.\r\n\r\n[446] Georg. B. ii. ll. 116, 117.\r\n\r\n[447] B. iii. c. 97. There is little doubt that, under the general name\r\nof “ebony,” the wood of many kinds of trees was, and is still, imported\r\ninto the western world, so that both Herodotus and Virgil may have been\r\ncorrect in representing ebony as the product of both India and Æthiopia.\r\n\r\n[448] Herodotus says two hundred.\r\n\r\n[449] In Italy, whither he had retired from the hostile attacks of his\r\nfellow-citizens. It is supposed by Le Vayer and others, that Pliny is\r\nwrong in his assertion, that Herodotus wrote to this effect while at\r\nThurii; though Dr. Schmitz is inclined to be of opinion that he is\r\nright in his statement.\r\n\r\n[450] B. iii. c. 115.\r\n\r\n[451] B. vi. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[452] Fée remarks, that the words of Pliny do not afford us any means\r\nof judging precisely what tree it was that he understood by the name of\r\nebony. He borrows his account mainly from Theophrastus.\r\n\r\n[453] It is not known to what tree he alludes.\r\n\r\n[454] This account of the Ficus Indica, or religiosa, known to us as\r\nthe banian-tree, is borrowed entirely from Theophrastus. Fée remarks,\r\nhowever, that he is wrong in some of his statements, for that the\r\nleaves are not crescent-shaped, but oblong and pointed, and that the\r\nfruit has not a pleasant flavour, and is only eaten by the birds.\r\n\r\n[455] See B. vi. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[456] Sprengel and Bauhin are of opinion that the banana is the tree\r\nmeant here; Dodonæus thinks that it is the pomegranate. Thevet says\r\nthat the pala is the paquovera of India, the fruit of which is called\r\npacona. The account is borrowed from Theophrastus.\r\n\r\n[457] The Gymnosophists, or Brahmins.\r\n\r\n[458] Called Syndraci in B. vi. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[459] It is not improbable that the Tamarindus Indica of Linnæus is the\r\ntree here alluded to: though M. Fée combats that opinion.\r\n\r\n[460] See Theophrastus, B. iv. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[461] Dalechamps and Desfontaines are of opinion, that the pistachio,\r\nor Pistacia terebinthus of Linnæus, is here alluded to; but Fée\r\nconsiders that there are no indications to lead to such a conclusion.\r\n\r\n[462] It is not improbable that he may here allude to the cotton-tree,\r\nof which further mention is made in c. xxi. of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[463] Fée is of opinion that Cynorrhodon here means, not the dog-rose,\r\nbut the gall which is formed on the tree by the sting of the Cynips\r\nbedeguar.\r\n\r\n[464] Fée expresses himself at a loss to conjecture what trees are here\r\nmeant by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[465] Fée remarks, that there are many inaccuracies in the account\r\nhere given by Pliny of the pepper-tree, and that it does not bear any\r\nresemblance to the juniper-tree. The grains, he says, grow in clusters,\r\nand not in a husk or pod; and he remarks, that the long pepper and the\r\nblack pepper, of which the white is only a variety divested of the\r\nouter coat, are distinct species. He also observes, that the real long\r\npepper, the Piper longum of Linnæus, was not known to the ancients.\r\n\r\n[466] Fée remarks, that this is not a correct description of ginger,\r\nthe Amomum zingiber of Linnæus. Dioscorides was one of those who\r\nthought that ginger was the root of the pepper-tree.\r\n\r\n[467] It is very doubtful what tree is here alluded to by Pliny, though\r\ncertain that it is not one of the pepper-trees. Sprengel takes it to be\r\nthe Daphne Thymelæa.\r\n\r\n[468] It has been suggested that under this name the clove is meant,\r\nthough Fée and Desfontaines express a contrary opinion. Sprengel thinks\r\nthat it is the Vitex trifolia of Linnæus, and Bauhin suggests the\r\ncubeb, the Piper cubeba of Linnæus. Fée thinks it may have possibly\r\nbeen the Myrtus caryophyllata of Ceylon, the fruit of which corresponds\r\nto the description here given by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[469] See c. 52 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[470] Or “Lycium.” It is impossible to say with exactness what the\r\nmedical liquid called “Lycion” was. Catechu, an extract from the tan of\r\nthe acacia, has been suggested; though the fruit of that tree does not\r\nanswer the present description.\r\n\r\n[471] Fée suggests that this may possibly be the Lycium Europæum of\r\nLinnæus, a shrub not uncommonly found in the south of Europe.\r\n\r\n[472] The Rhamnus Lycioides of Linnæus, known to us as buckthorn. The\r\nberries of many varieties of the Rhamnus are violent purgatives.\r\n\r\n[473] What he means under this head is not known. Fée speaks of a tree\r\nwhich the Brahmins call macre, and which the Portuguese called arvore\r\nde las camaras, arvore sancto, arvore de sancto Thome, but of which\r\nthey have given no further particulars. Acosta, Clusius, and Bauhin\r\nhave also professed to give accounts of it, but they do not lead to its\r\nidentification. De Jussieu thinks that either the Soulamea, the Rex\r\namaroris of Rumphius, or else the Polycardia of Commerson is meant. It\r\nseems by no means impossible that mace, the covering of the nutmeg, is\r\nthe substance alluded to, an opinion that is supported by Gerard and\r\nDesfontaines.\r\n\r\n[474] “Saccharon.” Fée suggests that Pliny alludes to a peculiar kind\r\nof crystallized sugar, that is found in the bamboo cane, though, at\r\nthe same time, he thinks it not improbable that he may have heard of\r\nthe genuine sugar-cane; as Strabo, B. xv., speaks of a honey found in\r\nIndia, prepared without the aid of bees, and Lucan has the line—\r\n\r\n  “Quique bibunt tenerâ dulces ab arundine succos,”\r\n\r\nevidently referring to a sugar in the form of a syrup, and not of\r\ncrystal, like that of the Bambos arundinacea. It is by no means\r\nimprobable, that Pliny, or rather Dioscorides, from whom he copies,\r\nconfuses the two kinds of sugar; as it is well known that the Saccharum\r\nofficinarum, or sugar-cane, has been cultivated from a very early\r\nperiod in Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\n[475] It is unknown what plant is here alluded to by Pliny, but\r\nSprengel suggests that it is the Acacia latronum.\r\n\r\n[476] From the description, this would appear to be a sort of poisonous\r\nhorse-radish.\r\n\r\n[477] There is a tree in India, as we are informed by Fée, which is\r\nknown as the Excæcaria Agallochum, the juice of which is remarkably\r\nacrid. Sailors, on striking it with a hatchet, and causing the juice to\r\nspirt into their eyes, have been in danger of losing their sight. It is\r\npossible that this may be the tree here alluded to by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[478] He borrows the account of this marvellous shrub from\r\nTheophrastus. No such plant is likely to have ever existed; though\r\nsmall, and even large, snakes may occasionally take refuge among shrubs\r\nand hollow trees.\r\n\r\n[479] There is little doubt that the Hedysarum Alhagi of Linnæus\r\nis here meant, from which a kind of honey or manna flows, known as\r\n“Eastern” manna, or tereniabin. It is not so high as the fig-tree, and\r\nis found in Khorasan, Syria, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere. The manna\r\ndistils principally in the morning.\r\n\r\n[480] Fée remarks, that it is singular that a resinous gum, such as\r\nbdellium, should have been used in commerce for now two thousand years,\r\nand yet its origin remain unknown. Kæmpfer and Rumphus are of opinion,\r\nthat the tree which produces it is the one known to naturalists as the\r\nBorassus flabelliformis of Linnæus, or the Lontarus of others. It is\r\nimported into Europe from Arabia and India, and is often found mixed\r\nwith gum Arabic.\r\n\r\n[481] Περατικὸν; from περατὰ γῆς, “the remotest parts of the earth,”\r\nfrom which it was brought.\r\n\r\n[482] The modern name of this tree is unknown.\r\n\r\n[483] B. vi. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[484] It is supposed that the Rhizophora Mangle of Linnæus is the tree\r\nthat is here described. It grows on all the coasts of India, from Siam\r\nto the entrance of the Persian Gulf. It takes root on spots which have\r\nbeen inundated by the sea, and its boughs bend downwards, and taking\r\nroot in the earth, advance gradually towards the sea. The leaf and\r\nfruit have the characteristics of those of the arbute and almond as\r\nhere mentioned.\r\n\r\n[485] B. vi. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[486] Fée suggests that some kind of mangrove is probably alluded to,\r\nof the kind known as avicennia, or bruguiera.\r\n\r\n[487] See B. vi. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[488] “Cotonei.” To this resemblance of its fruit to the quince, the\r\ncotton-tree, which is here alluded to, not improbably owes its modern\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[489] The cotton-tree, or Gossypium arboreum of Linnæus. It is worthy\r\nof remark, that Pliny copies here almost literally from Theophrastus.\r\nAccording to Philostratus, the byssus, or fine tissues worn by the\r\nEgyptian priests, were made of cotton.\r\n\r\n[490] The Malthiola incana.\r\n\r\n[491] Fée suggests that this may be a Magnolia; but, as he remarks,\r\nmost plants open and shut at certain hours; consequently, this cannot\r\nbe regarded as any peculiar characteristic, sufficient to lead with\r\ncertainty to its identification.\r\n\r\n[492] Theophrastus, from whom our author is copying, says that this is\r\nthe case only with the fig-tree there.\r\n\r\n[493] According to most commentators, this is the Costus Arabicus of\r\nLinnæus. Dioscorides mentions three varieties of costus: the Arabian,\r\nwhich is of the best quality, and is white and odoriferous; the Indian,\r\nwhich is black and smooth; and the Syrian, which is of the colour\r\nof wax, dusky, and strong smelling. Fée, however, doubts whether\r\nthe modern costus is the same thing as that of the ancients; for,\r\nas he says, although it has a sweet odour, it does not deserve the\r\nappellation of a “precious aromatic,” which we find constantly given to\r\nit by the ancients.\r\n\r\n[494] See B. vi. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[495] It is probable that the nard of the ancients, from which they\r\nextracted the famous nard-oil, was not the same plant which we know as\r\nthe Indian nard, or Andropogon nardus of Linnæus. Indeed, it has been\r\npretty conclusively established by Sir William Jones, in his “Asiatic\r\nResearches,” that the Valeriana Jatamansi is the plant from which they\r\nobtained the oil. Among the Hindoos, it is known as djatâmansi, and by\r\nthe Arabs under the name of sombul, or “spike,” from the fact of the\r\nbase being surrounded with ears or spikes, whence, probably, the Roman\r\nappellation. This species of valerian grows in the more distant and\r\nmountainous parts of India, Bootan and Nepaul, for instance.\r\n\r\n[496] From the Greek, ὄζαινα, “a putrid sore.” Fée suggests that this\r\nmay have been the Nardus hadrosphærum of the moderns.\r\n\r\n[497] Fée supposes that this is not lavender, as some have thought, but\r\nthe Allium victorialis of modern naturalists, which is still mixed with\r\nthe nard from the Andropogon. He doubts the possibility of its having\r\nbeen adulterated with substances of such a different nature as those\r\nmentioned here by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[498] Fée is of opinion, that the Greek writers, from whom Pliny copied\r\nthis passage, intended to speak of the ears of nard, or spikenard.\r\n\r\n[499] According to Dioscorides, this appellation only means such nard\r\nas is cultivated in certain mountains of India which look toward\r\nSyria, and which, according to that author, was the best nard of all.\r\nDalechamps and Hardouin, however, ridicule this explanation of the term.\r\n\r\n[500] Generally supposed to be the Valeriana Celtica of modern\r\nnaturalists. See B. xxi. c. 79.\r\n\r\n[501] Probably the Valeriana Italica of modern naturalists.\r\n\r\n[502] See B. xix. c. 48.\r\n\r\n[503] Known in this country as fox-glove, our Lady’s gloves, sage of\r\nJerusalem, or clown’s spikenard. See B. xxi. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[504] Not always, but very seldom, Brotier says. Clusius has\r\nestablished, from observation, that this plant is only a variety of the\r\nValeriana Celtica.\r\n\r\n[505] Fée remarks, that the name “baccara,” in Greek, properly belonged\r\nto this plant, but that it was transferred by the Romans to the field\r\nnard, with which the Asarum had become confounded. It is the same as\r\nthe Asarum Europæum of modern naturalists; but it does not, as Pliny\r\nasserts, flower twice in the year.\r\n\r\n[506] It is by no means settled among naturalists, what plant the\r\nAmomum of the ancients was; indeed, there has been the greatest\r\ndivergence of opinion. Tragus takes it to be a kind of bindweed:\r\nMatthioli, the Piper Æthiopicum of Linnæus: Cordus and Scaliger,\r\nthe rose of Jericho, the Anastatica hierocuntica of Linnæus. Gesner\r\nthinks it to have been the garden pepper, the Solanum bacciferum of\r\nTournefort: Cæsalpinus the cubeb, the Piper cubeba of Linnæus: Plukenet\r\nand Sprengel the Cissus vitiginea, while Fée and Paulet look upon it as\r\nnot improbably identical with the Amomum racemosum of Linnæus. The name\r\nis probably derived from the Arabic hahmâma, the Arabians having first\r\nintroduced it to the notice of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n[507] Supposed to have been only the Amomum, in an unripe state, as\r\nPliny himself suggests.\r\n\r\n[508] Still known in pharmacy as “cardamum.” It is not, however, as\r\nPliny says, found in Arabia, but in India; from which it probably\r\nreached the Greeks and Romans by way of the Red Sea. There are three\r\nkinds known in modern commerce, the large, the middle size, and the\r\nsmall. M. Bonastre, “Journal de Pharmacie,” May, 1828, is of opinion,\r\nthat the word cardamomum signifies “amomum in pods,” the Egyptian kardh\r\nmeaning “pod,” or “husk.” It is, however, more generally supposed, that\r\nthe Greek word, καρδία, “heart,” enters into its composition.\r\n\r\n[509] “Verus” seems a preferable reading here to “vero,” which has been\r\nadopted by Sillig.\r\n\r\n[510] See c. 42 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[511] Virgil, Georg. B. ii. l. 139, mentions Panchaia, in Arabia,\r\nas being more especially the country of frankincense. That region\r\ncorresponds with the modern Yemen. It is, however, a well-ascertained\r\nfact, that it grows in India as well, and it is supposed that the\r\ngreater part of it used by the ancients was in reality imported from\r\nthat country. The Indian incense is the product of a tree belonging\r\nto the terebinth class, named by Roxburgh, who first discovered it,\r\nBoswellia thurifera. It is more especially found in the mountainous\r\nparts of India. On the other hand, it has been asserted that the\r\nArabian incense was the product of a coniferous tree, either the\r\nJuniperus Lycia, the Juniperus Phœnicea, or the Juniperus thurifera of\r\nLinnæus. But, as Fée justly remarks, it would appear more reasonable\r\nto look among the terebinths of Arabia for the incense tree, if one\r\nof that class produces it in India, and more especially because the\r\nconiferous trees produce only resins, while the terebinths produce gum\r\nresins, to which class of vegetable products frankincense evidently\r\nbelonged. In commerce, the gum resin, Olibanum, the produce of the\r\nBoswellia serrata, and imported from the Levant, bears the name of\r\nfrankincense.\r\n\r\n[512] See B. vi. c. 32. Their name is still preserved in the modern\r\nHadramaut, to the east of Aden.\r\n\r\n[513] See B. vi. cc. 31 and 32. He was the son of Agrippa and Julia,\r\nthe daughter of Augustus, by whom he was adopted.\r\n\r\n[514] This seems the most probable among these various surmises and\r\nconjectures.\r\n\r\n[515] These words are said by some to be derived from the Greek,\r\nκαρφὸς, “a hollow stalk,” on account of its lightness, and δᾳδίον, “a\r\ntorch,” on account of its resinous and inflammable qualities. It is,\r\nhowever, much more probable that they were derived from the Arabic, and\r\nnot from the Celto-Scythic, as Poinsinet conjectures.\r\n\r\n[516] Fée is probably right in his conjecture, that it was so called\r\nsolely in consequence of its superior strength.\r\n\r\n[517] Meaning “drop” incense.\r\n\r\n[518] “Undivided” incense.\r\n\r\n[519] From their being the size of an ὄροβος, or “chick-pea.”\r\n\r\n[520] There is some doubt as to the correctness of this reading. The\r\n“manna” here mentioned is quite a different substance to the manna of\r\nmodern commerce, obtained from the Fraxinus ornus of naturalists.\r\n\r\n[521] He was a kinsman of Olympias, the mother of Alexander, and a man\r\nof very austere habits. Plutarch says, that on this occasion Alexander\r\nsent to Leonidas 600 talents’ weight of incense and myrrh.\r\n\r\n[522] See B. vi. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[523] Probably the same as the deity, Assabinus, mentioned by Pliny in\r\nc. 42 of the present Book. Theophrastus mentions him as identical with\r\nthe sun, others, again, with Jupiter. Theophrastus says that the god\r\nreceived not a tenth part, but a third.\r\n\r\n[524] As to this place and the Gebanitæ, see B. vi. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[525] There must surely be some mistake in these numbers.\r\n\r\n[526] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[527] In c. 19 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[528] It is supposed to be the product of an amyris, but is not now\r\nesteemed as a perfume; but is used in medicine as a tonic. Forskhal\r\nhas attributed to the Amyris kataf, or kafal, the production of myrrh.\r\nAccording to Ehrenberg, a very similar tree, though constituting a\r\ndifferent species, the Balsamodendrum myrrha, also produces this\r\nsubstance. It is imported into Europe from both Abyssinia and Arabia.\r\nIt was much used by the ancients, to flavour their wines.\r\n\r\n[529] See B. vi. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[530] Theophrastus says the terebinth.\r\n\r\n[531] From the Greek στάζω, “to drop.” Fée observes, that the moderns\r\nknow nothing positive as to the mode of extracting myrrh from the\r\ntree. See the account given by Ovid, Met. B. x. l. 500 _et seq._ of\r\nthe transformation of Myrrha into this tree,—“The warm drops fall from\r\nthe tree. The tears, even, have their own honour; and the myrrh that\r\ndistils from the bark bears the name of its mistress, and in no age\r\nwill remain unknown.”\r\n\r\n[532] Fée remarks, that at the present day we are acquainted only with\r\none kind of myrrh; the fragments which bear an impression like those\r\nof nails being not a distinct kind, but a simple variety in appearance\r\nonly. He thinks, also, that Pliny may very possibly be describing\r\nseveral distinct resinous products, under the one name of myrrh. An\r\naccount of these various districts will be found in B. vi. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[533] Hardouin suggests that it may be so called from the island of\r\nDia, mentioned by Strabo, B. xvi.\r\n\r\n[534] “Collatitia.” The reading, however, is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[535] What this was is now unknown. Fée suggests that it may have been\r\nbdellium, which is found in considerable quantities in the myrrh that\r\nis imported at the present day.\r\n\r\n[536] This is most probably the meaning of Pliny’s expression—“Ergo\r\ntransit in mastichen;” though Hardouin reads it as meaning that myrrh\r\nsometimes degenerates to mastich: and Fée, understanding the passage in\r\nthe same sense, remarks that the statement is purely fabulous. Mastich,\r\nhe says, is the produce of the Pistacia lentiscus of Linnæus, which\r\nabounds in Greece and the other parts of southern Europe. The greater\r\npart of the mastich of commerce comes from the island of Chio. It is\r\nimpossible to conjecture to what plant Pliny here alludes, with the\r\nhead of a thistle.\r\n\r\n[537] This kind, Fée says, is quite unknown to the moderns.\r\n\r\n[538] This substance is still gathered from the Cistus creticus of\r\nLinnæus, which is supposed to be the same as the plant leda, mentioned\r\nby Pliny. It is also most probably the same as the Cisthon, mentioned\r\nby Pliny in B. xxiv. c. 48. It is very commonly found in Spain. The\r\nsubstance is gathered from off the leaves, not by the aid of goats,\r\nbut with whips furnished with several thongs, with which the shrubs\r\nare beaten. There are two sorts of ladanum known in commerce; the\r\none friable, and mixed with earthy substances, and known as “ladanum\r\nin tortis;” the other black, and soft to the fingers, the only\r\nadventitious substances in which are a little sand and a few hairs.\r\n\r\n[539] See B. vi. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[540] For some further account of this substance, see B. xxix. c. 10.\r\nFilthy as it was, the œsypum, or sweat and grease of sheep, was used by\r\nthe Roman ladies as one of their most choice cosmetics. Ovid, in his\r\n“Art of Love,” more than once inveighs against the use of it.\r\n\r\n[541] From the Greek ἔναιμον, “styptic,” or “blood-stopping.” It is at\r\nthe present day called gum “de lecce” in Italy. Fée says that it is not\r\noften procured from the olive-trees of France, though it is found very\r\ncommonly on those of Naples and Calabria. It has no active powers, he\r\nsays, as a medicine.\r\n\r\n[542] Hardouin suggests that they may be the pelagiæ, mentioned again\r\nin B. xiii. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[543] See B. vi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[544] Although the savin shrub, the Juniperus Sabina of Linnæus, bears\r\nthis name in Greek, it is evident, as Fée says, that Pliny does not\r\nallude to it, but to a coniferous tree, as it is that family which\r\nproduces a resinous wood with a balsamic odour when ignited. Bauhin\r\nand others would make the tree meant to be the Thuya occidentalis\r\nof Linnæus; but, as Fée observes, that tree is in reality a native\r\noriginally of Canada, while the Thuya orientalis is a native of Japan.\r\nHe suggests, however, that the Thuya articulata of Mount Atlas may have\r\npossibly been the citrus of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[545] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[546] All these are mentioned in B. vi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[547] It is not known what wood is meant under this name. Aloe, and\r\nsome other woods, when ignited are slightly narcotic.\r\n\r\n[548] See B. v. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[549] See B. vi. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[550] See c. 55 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[551] Because its perfumes were held in such high esteem, for burning\r\non the piles of the dead. This, of course, was done primarily to avoid\r\nthe offensive smell.\r\n\r\n[552] The bark of the Cinnamomum Zeylanicum of the modern naturalists,\r\nthe cinnamon-tree of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[553] B. iii.\r\n\r\n[554] See B. vi. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[555] See B. vi. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[556] As Fée observes, this description does not at all resemble\r\nthat of the cinnamon-tree of Ceylon, as known to us. M. Bonastre is\r\nof opinion that the nutmeg-tree was known to the ancients under this\r\nname; but, as Fée observes, the nutmeg could never have been taken for\r\na bark, and cinnamon is described as such in the ancient writers. He\r\ninclines to think that their cinnamon was really the bark of a species\r\nof amyris.\r\n\r\n[557] See c. 33 of the present Book, and the Note.\r\n\r\n[558] Or “wood of cinnamon.”\r\n\r\n[559] “Interrasili.” Gold partly embossed, and partly left plain, was\r\nthus called.\r\n\r\n[560] The Empress Livia.\r\n\r\n[561] There has been considerable doubt what plant it was that produced\r\nthe cassia of the ancients. Fée, after diligently enquiring into the\r\nsubject, inclines to think that it was the Laurus cassia of Linnæus,\r\nthe same tree that produces the cassia of the present day.\r\n\r\n[562] There is little doubt that all this is fabulous.\r\n\r\n[563] Or, “smelling like balsam.”\r\n\r\n[564] “Looking like laurel.”\r\n\r\n[565] “Equal to cinnamon.” Fée thinks that it is a variety of the\r\nLaurus cassia.\r\n\r\n[566] He probably alludes to the Daphne Cnidium of Linnæus, which, as\r\nFée remarks, is altogether different from the Laurus cassia, or genuine\r\ncassia.\r\n\r\n[567] A gum resin of some unknown species, but not improbably, Fée\r\nthinks, the produce of some of the Amyrides. Sprengel thinks that it\r\nwas produced from the Gardenia gummifera.\r\n\r\n[568] Aloe-wood.\r\n\r\n[569] According to Poinsinet, these Arabic words derive their\r\norigin from the Slavonic; the first signifying a “cordial drug,”\r\nor “alexipharmic,” and the other a drug “which divides itself into\r\ntablets.” It is impossible to divine what drugs are meant by these\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n[570] Signifying the “unguent acorn,” or “nut.” There is little doubt\r\nthat the behen or ben nut of the Arabians is meant, of which there\r\nare several sorts. It is used by the Hindoos for calico printing and\r\npharmacy, and was formerly employed in Europe in the arts, and for\r\nmedical purposes. It is no longer used as a perfume. The “oil of ben”\r\nused in commerce is extracted from the fruit of the Moringa oleifera\r\nof naturalists. It is inodorous; for which reason, Fée is of opinion\r\nthat the name signifies “the oily nut,” and quotes Dioscorides, who\r\nsays, B. iv., that an oil is extracted from this balanus, which is used\r\nas an ingredient in unguents, in place of other oils. Fée also says\r\nthat at the present day it is used by perfumers, to fix or arrest the\r\nevanescent odours of such flowers as the jasmine and the lily.\r\n\r\n[571] This Æthiopian variety is quite unknown, and is, as Fée remarks,\r\nmost probably of a different species from the genuine myrobalanus.\r\n\r\n[572] See B. vi. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[573] “Curing thirst.” Dioscorides, B. i. c. 148, says that it was so\r\ncalled from, being full of juice, which quenched thirst like water.\r\n\r\n[574] “Palm-nut.” Fée thinks it not improbable that one of the\r\ndate-palms is meant, if we may judge from the name. He suggests that\r\npossibly the Elais or avoira of Guinea, the Elais Guineensis, which\r\nis found as far as Upper Egypt, and which produces a fine oil known\r\nas palm-oil, is meant, or possibly the Douma Thebaica, a palm-tree\r\nfrequently met with in Egypt. On fermentation, a vinous drink is\r\nextracted from the last, which is capable of producing intoxication.\r\n\r\n[575] Fée remarks, that this must not be confounded with the Calamus\r\naromaticus of the moderns, of which Pliny speaks in B. xxv. c. 100,\r\nwith sufficient accuracy to enable us to identify it with the Acorus\r\ncalamus of Linnæus. It is not ascertained by naturalists what plant is\r\nmeant by Pliny in the present instance, though Fée is of opinion that\r\na gramineous plant of the genus Andropogon is meant. M. Guibourt has\r\nsuggested that the Indian Gentiana chirayta is the plant. From what\r\nPliny says in B. xiii. c. 21, it appears that this calamus grew in\r\nSyria, which is also the native country of the Andropogon schœnanthus.\r\n\r\n[576] See B. xxiv. c. 14. The gum resin ammoniacum is still imported\r\ninto Europe from Africa and the East, in the form of drops or cakes. It\r\nis a mildly stimulating expectorant, and is said to be the produce of\r\nthe Dorema ammoniacum. There are still two sorts in commerce: the first\r\nin large masses of a yellow, dirty colour, mingled with heterogeneous\r\nsubstances, and of a plastic consistency. This is the phyrama of\r\nPliny, or mixed ammoniac. The other is in tears, of irregular form\r\nand a whitish colour, brittle and vitreous when broken. This is the\r\nthrauston, or “friable” ammoniac of Pliny. Jackson says, that the\r\nplant which produces it is common in Morocco, and is called feskouk,\r\nresembling a large stalk of fennel. The ammoniac of Morocco is not,\r\nhowever, imported into this country, being too much impregnated with\r\nsand, in consequence of not being gathered till it falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n[577] Solinus tells us, that the tree itself is called Metops.\r\n\r\n[578] It is clear that, under this name, certain lichens of a hairy or\r\nfilamentary nature are meant. They adhere, Dioscorides tells us, to the\r\ncedar, the white poplar, and the oak. The white ones belong, probably,\r\nto the Usnea florida of Linnæus, the red ones to the Usnea barbata, and\r\nthe black ones to the Alectoria jubata, an almost inodorous lichen.\r\n\r\n[579] Probably the Roccella tinctoria of Linnæus, a lichen most\r\ncommonly found upon rocks.\r\n\r\n[580] The henné, the Lawsonia inermis of the modern naturalists, a\r\nshrub found in Egypt, Syria, and Barbary. From this tree the henna is\r\nmade with which the women of the East stain the skin of their hands and\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[581] The jujube-tree. See B. xv. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[582] See B. xx. c. 82.\r\n\r\n[583] Or privet.\r\n\r\n[584] But in B. xxiv. c. 68, he says that this plant grows in the\r\nisland of Rhodes.\r\n\r\n[585] According to Fée, this is the same as the Lignum Rhodianum, or\r\nwood of Rhodes, of commerce, sometimes also called, but incorrectly,\r\nwood of roses. It is, probably, the same as the Convolvulus scoparius\r\nof Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[586] Or “red sceptre,” probably so called from the flowers clustering\r\nalong the whole length of the branches.\r\n\r\n[587] A liquid matter extracted from the beaver.\r\n\r\n[588] Generally regarded as identical with the Teucrium Marum of\r\nLinnæus, a sweet-smelling shrub found in the south of Europe and the\r\nEast, by us commonly known as “herb mastich,” somewhat similar to\r\nmarjoram. Fée says that the marum of Egypt is a kind of sage, the\r\nSalvia Æthiopis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[589] Balsam (or balm of Mecca, as it is sometimes called) is the\r\nproduce of two trees, probably varieties of one another, of the\r\nterebinth family, belonging to the genus Amyris. So far from being a\r\nnative solely of Judæa, Bruce assures us that its original country was\r\nthat which produces myrrh, in the vicinity of Babelmandel, and that the\r\ninhabitants use the wood solely for fuel. In Judæa it appears to have\r\nbeen cultivated solely in gardens; and it was this tree which produced\r\nthe famous balm of Gilead of Scripture. The balsam trees known to us do\r\nnot at all correspond with Pliny’s description, as they do not resemble\r\neither the vine or myrtle, nor are their leaves at all like those of\r\nrue.\r\n\r\n[590] “Malleolis.” So called when the new shoot of the tree springing\r\nfrom a branch of the former year, is cut off for the sake of planting,\r\nwith a bit of the old wood on each side of it, in the form of a mallet.\r\n\r\n[591] “Easily cut.” This and the other kinds, the names of which mean\r\n“rough barked,” and “good length,” are probably only varieties of the\r\nsame tree, in different states.\r\n\r\n[592] This is said, probably, in allusion to the smell, and not the\r\ntaste. Fée remarks, that Pliny speaks with a considerable degree of\r\nexaggeration, as its odour is very inferior to that of several balsams\r\nwhich contain benzoic acid. The balsam obtained by incision, as\r\nmentioned by Pliny, is not brought to Europe, but only that obtained\r\nby the process of decoction; which is known as “balm of Mecca,” or\r\nof Judæa. It is difficult to believe, according to Fée, that it was\r\nadulterated with the substances here mentioned by Pliny; oil of roses\r\nhaving been always a very precious commodity, wax being likely to\r\nchange its nature entirely, and gums not being of a nature to combine\r\nwith it. Its asserted effects upon milk he states to be entirely\r\nfabulous; the statement is derived from Dioscorides.\r\n\r\n[593] The concha, or “shell,” was a Greek and Roman liquid measure, of\r\nwhich there were two sizes. The smaller was half a cyathus, .0412 of an\r\nEnglish pint; the larger was about three times the size of the former,\r\nand was known also as the oxybaphum.\r\n\r\n[594] Or “wood of balsam.” It is still known in European commerce by\r\nits ancient name. The fruit is called Carpobalsamum.\r\n\r\n[595] See B. xxvi. cc. 53, 54.\r\n\r\n[596] These localities are mentioned in B. v.\r\n\r\n[597] The Storax officinalis of Linnæus, a tree found in the south of\r\nEurope and the Levant. The variety found in France, and known as the\r\nAliboufier, produces no storax, or at least a very small proportion.\r\nThe storax of commerce appears in three states—grain storax, with which\r\nPliny does not appear to have been acquainted; amygdalite, which is\r\nperhaps the sort which he speaks of as adulterated with bitter almonds;\r\nand lump storax, of reddish brown colour, which is frequently mixed\r\nwith wood dust, or worm dust, as mentioned by Pliny, and is but little\r\nesteemed. The tree is also called Liquidambar styraciflua.\r\n\r\n[598] A shrub of the family of Ombelliferæ, belonging to the genus\r\nbubon. It is a native of Asia Minor and Syria.\r\n\r\n[599] See B. xix. c. 52, and B. xx. c. 75.\r\n\r\n[600] This was a common notion with the Romans. Virgil, Georg. B. iii.\r\nl. 415, says:—\r\n\r\n  “Galbaneoque agitare graves nidore chelydros.”\r\n\r\nThough considered to produce a pleasant perfume by the ancients, it is\r\nno longer held in estimation for that quality, and is only employed in\r\nsome slight degree for medical purposes.\r\n\r\n[601] The produce of the Pastinaca opopanax of Linnæus, or the Panax\r\nCopticum of Bauhin, an umbelliferous plant which abounds in the East,\r\nand is not uncommon in the south of France. The gum called Opopanax\r\nwas formerly used, and its supposed virtues are indicated by its name,\r\nwhich signifies “the juice which is the universal remedy.”\r\n\r\n[602] The umbelliferous plant known as the Heracleum spondylium\r\nof Linnæus. It is commonly found in France, where it is called\r\nBerce-branc-ursine. It received its name from the resemblance of its\r\nsmell to that of the sphondyle, a fetid kind of wood-beetle.\r\n\r\n[603] Some suppose this tree to be the Laurus cassia of Linnæus,\r\nor wild cinnamon; others take it for the betel, the Piper betel of\r\nLinnæus. Clusius thinks that the name is derived from the Indian\r\nTamalpatra, the name given from time immemorial to the leaf of a\r\ntree known by the Arabs as the Cadegi-indi, possibly the same as the\r\nKatou-carua of the Malabars.\r\n\r\n[604] From the Greek ὀμφάκιον, being made of unripe grapes. As Fée\r\nremarks, that made from the olive is correctly described as a kind\r\nof oil, but that made from the grape must have been a rob, or pure\r\nverjuice. These two liquids must have had totally different qualities,\r\nand resembled each other in nothing but the name. That extracted from\r\nthe olive is mentioned again in B. xxiii. c. 4, in reference to its\r\nmedicinal properties.\r\n\r\n[605] These grapes are described in B. xiv. c. 4 and c. 11.\r\n\r\n[606] “Reliquum corpus.” It is not clear what is the meaning of this.\r\nThe passage is either in a corrupt state, or defective.\r\n\r\n[607] A singular metal, one would think, for keeping verjuice in.\r\n\r\n[608] From the Greek βρύον, “moss.” He speaks again of these grapes\r\nof the white poplar in B. xxiv. c. 34; also in c. 51 of the present\r\nBook. Hardouin thinks that he is speaking of moss. Fée is of opinion,\r\nthat the blossoms or buds of the tree are meant, which have a fragrant\r\nsmell. This is the more probable, as we find Pliny here speaking of\r\nthe œnanthe, or vine-flower, by which Fée supposes that he means the\r\nblossom of the Vitis vinifera of Linnæus, which exhales a delightful\r\nperfume.\r\n\r\n[609] The bud, probably, of the Juniperus Lycia.\r\n\r\n[610] See B. vi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[611] Said to have been a surname given by some nations to the god\r\nBacchus.\r\n\r\n[612] It is generally supposed by the commentators, that Pliny makes\r\na mistake here, and that the elate or spathe was not a tree, but the\r\nenvelope or capsule, containing the flowers and fruit of a tree, which\r\nis supposed by some to have been really the Phœnix dactylifera, or\r\ndate-palm. There can be little doubt that he is mistaken in his mention\r\nof the abies or fir-tree here. See B. xxiii. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[613] Bauhin thinks that this juice or oil was extracted from the\r\nnutmeg, the Myristica moschata of Thunberg, and Bonastre is of the\r\nsame opinion. But, as Fée observes, the nutmeg is a native of India,\r\nand Pliny speaks of the Comacum as coming from Syria. Some authors, he\r\nadds, who are of this opinion, think also that the other cinnamomum\r\nmentioned by Pliny was no other than the nutmeg, which they take to be\r\nthe same as the chrysobalanos, or “golden nut,” of Galen.\r\n\r\n[614] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[615] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[616] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[617] Fabianus Papirius: see end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[618] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[619] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[620] The son of a freedman; some further particulars are given of him\r\nby Pliny in B. xxxiii. c. 1. By his talents and eloquence, he attained\r\nconsiderable distinction at Rome. He was made a senator by Appius\r\nClaudius, and was curule ædile B.C. 303. He published a collection of\r\nlegal rules, entitled the “Jus Flavianum.”\r\n\r\n[621] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[622] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[623] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[624] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[625] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[626] Probably the same as the Niger mentioned by Dioscorides as a\r\nwriter on Materia Medica. He is also mentioned by Epiphanius and Galen;\r\nbut Dioscorides charges him with numerous blunders in his accounts of\r\nvegetable productions.\r\n\r\n[627] A compiler of Roman history, who wrote at the beginning of the\r\nsecond century before Christ. He wrote Annals of Rome from the earliest\r\nto his own times: only a few fragments of his work have survived.\r\n\r\n[628] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[629] C. Sempronius Tuditanus, consul of Rome, B.C. 129. He wrote a\r\nbook of historical Commentaries. He was maternal grandfather of the\r\norator Hortensius.\r\n\r\n[630] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[631] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[632] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[633] A native of Olynthus. His mother, Hero, was a cousin of the\r\nphilosopher Aristotle, under whose tutelage he was educated. It is\r\ngenerally supposed that he was put to death by order of Alexander\r\nthe Great, but in what manner is a matter of uncertainty. He wrote a\r\nHistory of Greece, and numerous other learned works. Some MSS. are\r\nstill extant, professing to be his writings; but they are generally\r\nlooked upon as spurious.\r\n\r\n[634] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[635] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[636] A native of Lampsacus, and disciple of Diogenes the Cynic. He\r\naccompanied Alexander the Great in his Asiatic expedition. He wrote a\r\nhistory of the reigns of Philip and Alexander, and a history of Greece,\r\nin twelve books. Only a few fragments of his works are left.\r\n\r\n[637] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[638] See end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[639] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[640] There was a native of Mendæ, in Sicily, of this name, who wrote\r\na history of Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse. It was, probably, a\r\ndifferent person of this name who wrote a work on the East; if such is\r\nthe case, Pliny most probably quotes from the work of the latter.\r\n\r\n[641] Nothing seems to be known of this writer; but it is suggested\r\nthat he may have accompanied Nearchus and Onesicritus in the East.\r\n\r\n[642] See end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[643] Nothing is known of him; but Hardouin suggests that he may have\r\naccompanied Alexander the Great in his Eastern expedition.\r\n\r\n[644] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[645] An officer at the court of Alexander the Great, who wrote a\r\ncollection of anecdotes respecting the private life and reign of that\r\nemperor, some fragments of which are preserved by Athenæus.\r\n\r\n[646] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[647] He is supposed to have been the same with the person of that name\r\nwho wrote a history of Alexander the Great; but nothing further is\r\nknown of him.\r\n\r\n[648] A physician of Neapolis, who is supposed to have lived in the\r\nearly part of the first century after Christ.\r\n\r\n[649] A writer on medicine, of whom all further particulars have\r\nperished.\r\n\r\n[650] Possibly Ephippus of Olynthus, a Greek historian of the reign of\r\nAlexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[651] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[652] An ancient Greek historian, mentioned also by Strabo; but no\r\nfurther particulars are known of him.\r\n\r\n[653] The founder of the dynasty of the Egyptian Ptolemies, which ended\r\nin Cleopatra, B.C. 38: he wrote a narrative of the wars of Alexander,\r\nwhich is frequently quoted by the later writers, and served as the\r\ngroundwork for Arrian’s history.\r\n\r\n[654] A native of Pella, who wrote a history of Macedonia down to the\r\nwars of Alexander the Great. There was another writer of the same name,\r\na native of Philippi, who also wrote a treatise, either geographical or\r\nhistorical, relative to Macedonia.\r\n\r\n[655] A native of Amphipolis, though some make him to have been an\r\nEphesian. The age in which he lived is not exactly known. He attacked\r\nthe writings of Homer with such uncalled-for asperity, that his name\r\nhas been proverbial for a snarling, captious critic. He is said to have\r\nmet with a violent death. His literary productions were numerous, but\r\nnone of them have come down to us.\r\n\r\n[656] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[657] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[658] See end of B. xi.\r\n\r\n[659] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[660] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[661] See end of B. xi.\r\n\r\n[662] A physician of Heraclea, near Ephesus. He wrote commentaries on\r\nthe works of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n[663] Nothing is known of him; but it has been suggested that he may\r\nhave been the author of a few fragments on veterinary surgery which\r\nstill exist.\r\n\r\n[664] There were many physicians and surgeons of this name, but\r\nprobably Dionysius of Samos is meant, or else Sallustius Dionysius,\r\nquoted by Pliny, B. xxxii. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[665] Also called Democedes, a physician of Crotona, who practised at\r\nÆgina. He was afterwards physician to Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos,\r\nand King Darius, whose foot he cured. His work on medicine has perished.\r\n\r\n[666] Nothing whatever is known of this writer.\r\n\r\n[667] Nothing is known relative to this writer.\r\n\r\n[668] Nothing is known of him.\r\n\r\n[669] Or Iölaus, a native of Bithynia, who wrote a work on Materia\r\nMedica. He was probably a contemporary of Heraclides of Tarentum, in\r\nthe third century B.C.\r\n\r\n[670] A physician of Tarentum, who belonged to the Empiric sect. He\r\nwrote several medical works, and is highly commended by Galen. Only a\r\nfew fragments of his writings remain.\r\n\r\n[671] An historical and geographical writer, frequently quoted by\r\nPliny. From the mention made of him in B. xxxvii. c. 2, it would appear\r\nthat he flourished during the time of Pliny, or very shortly before.\r\n\r\n[672] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[673] Fée remarks, that most of the unguents and perfumes of which\r\nPliny here speaks would find but little favour at the present day.\r\n\r\n[674] This does not appear to be exactly the case, for in the\r\ntwenty-third Book of the Iliad, l. 186, we find “rose-scented” oil\r\nmentioned, indeed, Pliny himself alludes to it a little further on.\r\n\r\n[675] “Nidorem.” This term was used in reference to the smell of burnt\r\nor roasted animal substances. It is not improbable that he alludes to\r\nthe stench arising from the burnt sacrifices.\r\n\r\n[676] The “Thuya articulata.” See c. 29 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[677] “Scrinium.” See B. vii. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[678] The use of perfumes more probably originated in India, than among\r\nthe Persians.\r\n\r\n[679] But of seeds or plants.\r\n\r\n[680] The perfumes of Delos themselves had nothing in particular to\r\nrecommend them; but as it was the centre of the worship of Apollo, it\r\nis not improbable that exquisite perfumes formed a large proportion of\r\nthe offerings brought thither from all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[681] In Egypt. See B. v. c. 11. The unguents of Mendes are again\r\nmentioned in the present Chapter.\r\n\r\n[682] Or flower-de-luce. This perfume was called Irinum. The Iris\r\nFlorentina of the botanists, Fée says, has the smell of the violet. For\r\nthe composition of this perfume, see Dioscorides, B. i. c. 67.\r\n\r\n[683] Rhodinum.\r\n\r\n[684] See B. v. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[685] Crocinum; made from the Crocus sativus of naturalists.\r\n\r\n[686] See B. xii. c. 62. It was made from the flowers of the vine,\r\nmixed with omphacium.\r\n\r\n[687] Amaracinum. The amaracus is supposed to have been the Origanum\r\nmajoranoides of the moderns. Dioscorides, B. i. c. 59, says that the\r\nbest was made at Cyzicus.\r\n\r\n[688] Melinum. See B. xxiii. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[689] Cyprinum. See B. xii. c. 51. The cyprus was the modern Lawsonia\r\ninermis.\r\n\r\n[690] Made from the oil of bitter almonds. See B. xv. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[691] Or “all Athenian.” We find in Athenæus, B. xv. c. 15, the\r\ncomposition of this unguent.\r\n\r\n[692] From what is said by Apollonius in the passage of Athenæus last\r\nquoted, it has been thought that this was the same as the unguent\r\ncalled nardinum. It is very doubtful, however.\r\n\r\n[693] Narcissinum. See B. xxi. c. 75. Dioscorides gives the composition\r\nof this unguent, B. i. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[694] Among the stymmata, Dioscorides ranges the sweet-rush, the\r\nsweet-scented calamus and xylo-balsamum; and among the hedysmata\r\namomum, nard, myrrh, balsam, costus, and marjoram. The latter\r\nconstituted the _base_ of unguents, the former were only added\r\noccasionally.\r\n\r\n[695] Cinnabar is never used to colour cosmetics at the present day,\r\nfrom its tendency to excoriate the skin. See B. xxiii. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[696] This is still used for colouring cosmetics at the present day.\r\nSee B. xxii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[697] Fée remarks, that salt can be of no use; but by falling to the\r\nbottom without dissolving, would rather tend to spoil the unguent.\r\n\r\n[698] See B. xii. c. 60. The name “bryon” seems also to have been\r\nextended to the buds of various trees of the Conifera class and of the\r\nwhite poplar. It is probably to the buds of the last tree that Pliny\r\nhere alludes.\r\n\r\n[699] Oil of ben. See B. xii. c. 48.\r\n\r\n[700] Or metopium. See Note [690] above.\r\n\r\n[701] Made from olives.

B. xii. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[706] See B. xii. c. 56.\r\n\r\n[707] Fluid resin of coniferous trees of Europe.\r\n\r\n[708] See B. xv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[709] Cupressus semper-virens. He does not say what part of the tree\r\nwas employed.\r\n\r\n[710] See B. xii. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[711] See c. 34 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[712] The alkanet and cinnabar were only used for colouring.\r\n\r\n[713] “Sampsuchinum.” It is generally supposed that the sampsuchum, and\r\nthe amaracus were the same, the sweet marjoram, or Origanum marjorana\r\nof Linnæus. Fée, however, is of a contrary opinion. See B. xxi. c.\r\n35. In Dioscorides, B. i. c. 59, there is a difference made between\r\nsampsuchinum and amaracinum, though but a very slight one.\r\n\r\n[714] The bark of the Cassia lignea of the pharmacopœa, the Laurus\r\ncassia of botany. See B. xii. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[715] See B. xii. c. 26. The Andropogon nardus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[716] See B. xii. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[717] See B. xxiii. c. 54, also B. xv. c. 10. The Malum struthium, or\r\n“sparrow quince,” was an oblong variety of the fruit.\r\n\r\n[718] Sesamum orientale of Linnæus. See B. xviii. c. 22, and B. xxii.\r\nc. 54.\r\n\r\n[719] Balm of Gilead. See B. xii. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[720] Southernwood. The Artemisia abrotonum of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[721] Or lily unguent, made of the lily of Susa, which had probably\r\na more powerful smell than that of Europe. Dioscorides gives its\r\ncomposition, B. i. c. 63.\r\n\r\n[722] The Crocus sativus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[723] Cyprinum. It has been previously mentioned in this Chapter.\r\n\r\n[724] See B. xii. c. 52.\r\n\r\n[725] The gum resin of the Pastinaca opopanax of Linnæus. See B. xii.\r\nc. 57.\r\n\r\n[726] Or unguent of fenugreek, from the Greek τῆλις, meaning that\r\nplant, the Trigonella fœnum Græcum of Linnæus. See B. xxiv. c. 120.\r\n\r\n[727] See B. ii. c. 26, and B. xxi. c. 68-70.\r\n\r\n[728] The Trifolium melilotus of Linnæus. See B. xxi. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[729] See B. xii. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[730] He would imply that it was so called from the Greek μεγὰς,\r\n“great;” but it was more generally said that it received its name from\r\nits inventor, Megalus.\r\n\r\n[731] See B. xii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[732] Fée does not appear to credit this statement. By the use of the\r\nword “ventiletur,” “fanned” may be possibly implied.\r\n\r\n[733] See B. xii. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[734] The Agnus castus of Linnæus. See B. xxiv. c. 38. The leaves are\r\nquite inodorous, though the fruit of this plant is slightly aromatic.\r\n\r\n[735] “Externa.” The reading is doubtful, and it is difficult to say\r\nwhat is the exact meaning of the word.\r\n\r\n[736] Cinnamomino.\r\n\r\n[737] Nardinum.\r\n\r\n[738] Or leaf unguent, so called from being made of leaves of nard. See\r\nB. xii. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[739] See B. xii. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[740] See B. xii. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[741] See B. xii. c. 26, 27, where the list is given.\r\n\r\n[742] See B. xii. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[743] Susinum.

See also Mark xiv. 7, and John xii. 3.\r\nLeaden boxes were also used for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\n[757] Odores.\r\n\r\n[758] “Heres.” The person was so called who succeeded to the property,\r\nwhether real or personal, of an intestate.\r\n\r\n[759] See B. xvii. c. 3, where he quotes this passage from Cicero at\r\nlength. It appears to be from De Orat. B. iii. c. 69. Both Cicero\r\nand Pliny profess to find a smell that arises from the earth itself,\r\nthrough the agency of the sun. But, as Fée remarks, pure earth is\r\nperfectly inodorous. He suggests, however, that this odour attributed\r\nby the ancients to the earth, may in reality have proceeded from the\r\nfibrous roots of thyme and other plants. If such is not the real\r\nsolution, it seems impossible to suggest any other.\r\n\r\n[760] By giving preference to the more simple odours.\r\n\r\n[761] “Crassitudo.”\r\n\r\n[762] Or “thick” unguent.\r\n\r\n[763] We learn from Athenæus, and a passage in the Aulularia of\r\nPlautus, that this was done long before Nero’s time, among the Greeks.\r\n\r\n[764] Who succeeded Galba. He was one of Nero’s favourite companions in\r\nhis debaucheries.\r\n\r\n[765] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[766] Solium.\r\n\r\n[767] After victories, for instance, or when marching orders were given.\r\n\r\n[768] This is said in bitter irony.\r\n\r\n[769] Sub casside.\r\n\r\n[770] Asia Minor more particularly.\r\n\r\n[771] Exotica.\r\n\r\n[772] The organs of taste and of smell.\r\n\r\n[773] We have this fact alluded to in the works of Plautus, Juvenal,\r\nMartial, and Ælian. The Greeks were particularly fond of mixing myrrh\r\nwith their wine. Nard wine is also mentioned by Plautus. Miles Gl. iii.\r\n2, 11.\r\n\r\n[774] Or Lucius Plautius Plancus. He was proscribed by the triumvirs,\r\nwith the sanction of his brother. In consequence of his use of\r\nperfumes, the place of his concealment “got wind;” and in order to save\r\nhis slaves, who were being tortured to death because they would not\r\nbetray him, he voluntarily surrendered himself.\r\n\r\n[775] Attaching to the triumvirate.\r\n\r\n[776] Capua, its capital, was the great seat of the unguent and perfume\r\nmanufacture in Italy.\r\n\r\n[777] The Phœnix dactylifera of Linnæus. See also B. xii. c. 62, where\r\nhe seems also to allude to this tree.\r\n\r\n[778] At the present day this is not the fact. The village of La\r\nBordighiera, situate on an eminence of the Apennines, grows great\r\nquantities of dates, of good quality. At Hieres, Nice, San Remo, and\r\nGenoa, they are also grown.\r\n\r\n[779] This, too, is not the fact. The dates of Valencia, Seville, and\r\nother provinces of Spain, are sweet, and of excellent quality.\r\n\r\n[780] Pliny is wrong again in this statement. The date of Barbary,\r\nTunis, Algiers, and Bildulgerid, the “land of dates,” is superior in\r\nevery respect to that of the East.\r\n\r\n[781] The Æthiopians, as we learn from Theophrastus, B. ii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[782] Or in a wild state.\r\n\r\n[783] “Tectorii vicem.” They were probably planted in rows, close to\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n[784] This mode of ascending the date-palm is still practised in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n[785] See B. xvi. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[786] “Umbracula.” The fibres of the leaves were probably platted or\r\nwoven, and the “umbracula” made in much the same manner as the straw\r\nand fibre hats of the present day.\r\n\r\n[787] Most of this is borrowed from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. ii. 9.\r\n\r\n[788] Fée remarks, that this account is quite erroneous.\r\n\r\n[789] This he copies also from Theophrastus, B. ii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[790] Theophrastus, B. ii. c. 8, mentions this as a kind of date\r\npeculiar to Cyprus.\r\n\r\n[791] This is said solely in relation to the date of Cyprus.\r\n\r\n[792] Or “dwellers in tents;” similar to the modern Bedouins.\r\n\r\n[793] Fée remarks, that in these words we find the first germs of\r\nthe sexual system that has been established by the modern botanists.\r\nHe thinks that it is clearly shown by this account, that Pliny was\r\nacquainted with the fecundation of plants by the agency of the pollen.\r\n\r\n[794] In allusion to the pollen, possibly. See the last Note.\r\n\r\n[795] “Lanugine.” It is possible that in the use of this word, also, he\r\nmay allude to the pollen. Under the term “pulvis,” “dust,” he probably\r\nalludes in exaggerated terms to the same theory.\r\n\r\n[796] The same methods of propagating the palm are still followed in\r\nthe East, and in the countries near the tropics.\r\n\r\n[797] In c. 7 of the present Book. See also B. xvii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[798] Fée mentions one near Elvas in Spain, which shot up into seven\r\ndistinct trees, as it were, from a single trunk. The Douma Thebaica, he\r\nsays, of Syria and Egypt, a peculiar kind of palm, is also bifurcated.\r\nThe fruit of it, he thinks, are very probably the Phænico-balanus of B.\r\nxii. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[799] “Spado.” Represented by the Greek εὔνουχος and ἔνορχος.\r\n\r\n[800] “Cæduæ.” Though this is the fact as to some palm-trees, the\r\ngreater part perish after being cut; the vital bud occupying the\r\nsummit, and the trunk not being susceptible of any increase.\r\n\r\n[801] Cerebrum.\r\n\r\n[802] The Chamæreps humilis of the modern botanists. It is found, among\r\nother countries, in Spain, Morocco, and Arabia.\r\n\r\n[803] Vitilia.\r\n\r\n[804] “Vivaces.” Perhaps it may mean that the wood retains the fire for\r\na long time, when it burns.\r\n\r\n[805] Fée suggests that Pliny may possibly have confounded the fruit of\r\nother palms with the date.\r\n\r\n[806] This seems to have been a general name, as Pliny says, meaning an\r\neunuch; but it is evident that it was also used as a proper name, as in\r\nthe case of the eunuch who slew Artaxerxes, Ochus, B.C. 338, by poison,\r\nand of another eunuch who belonged to Darius, but afterwards fell into\r\nthe hands of Alexander, of whom he became an especial favourite. The\r\nname is sometimes written “Bagoüs,” and sometimes “Bagoas.”\r\n\r\n[807] Dominantis in aula.\r\n\r\n[808] From the Greek σύαγρος, “a wild boar,” as Pliny afterwards\r\nstates; they being so called from their peculiar wild taste.\r\n\r\n[809] See B. vi. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[810] Said to have been so called from the Greek κάρη, “the head,” and\r\nὑωδία, “stupidity,” owing to the heady nature of the wine extracted\r\nfrom the fruit.\r\n\r\n[811] See B. vi. c. 32, and B. xiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[812] The Jericho of Scripture.\r\n\r\n[813] Athenæus, B. xiv. c. 22, tells us that these dates were thus\r\ncalled from Nicolaus of Damascus, a Peripatetic philosopher, who,\r\nwhen visiting Rome with Herod the Great, made Augustus a present of\r\nthe finest fruit of the palm-tree that could be procured. This fruit\r\nretained its name of “Nicolaän,” down to the middle ages.\r\n\r\n[814] Pliny would imply that they are so called from the Greek ἀδέλφια,\r\n“a sister,” as being of sister quality to the caryotæ; but it is much\r\nmore probable, as Fée remarks, that they got this name from being\r\nattached in pairs to the same pedicle or stalk.\r\n\r\n[815] Pliny certainly seems to imply that they are so called from the\r\nGreek πατέω, “to tread under foot,” and Hardouin is of that opinion.\r\nFée, however, thinks the name is from the Hebrew or Syriac “patach,”\r\n“to expand,” or “open,” or else from the Hebrew “pathah,” the name of\r\nthe first vowel, from some fancied resemblance in the form.\r\n\r\n[816] From the Greek χυδαῖος, “vulgar,” or “common,” it is supposed.\r\nThe Jews probably called them so, as being common, or offered by the\r\nGentiles to their idols and divinities. Pliny evidently considers that\r\nin the name given to them no compliment was intended to the deities of\r\nthe heathen mythology.\r\n\r\n[817] From its extreme driness, and its shrivelled appearance.\r\n\r\n[818] From Theophrastus, B. i. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[819] Κύκως in the Greek. It is supposed by Sprengel to be the same as\r\nthe Cycas circinnalis of Linnæus; but, as Fée remarks, that is only\r\nfound in India.\r\n\r\n[820] From the Greek, meaning “sweetmeats,” or “dessert fruit:” he\r\nprobably means that in Syria and some parts of Phœnicia they were thus\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n[821] This story, which is borrowed from Theophrastus, B. iv. c. 5,\r\nis doubted by Fée, who says that in the green state they are so hard\r\nand nauseous, that it is next to impossible to eat sufficient to be\r\nmaterially incommoded by them.\r\n\r\n[822] The Pistacia vera of Linnæus. It was introduced into Rome in the\r\nreign of Tiberius. The kernel is of no use whatever in a medical point\r\nof view, and what Pliny says about its curing the bite of serpents is\r\nperfectly fabulous.\r\n\r\n[823] See B. xv. c. 19. The “carica” was properly the “Carian” fig.\r\n“Ficus carica” is, however, the name given to the common fig by the\r\nmodern botanists.\r\n\r\n[824] The parent of our Damascenes, or damsons. See B. xv. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[825] Supposed to be the Corda myxa of Linnæus. See B. xv. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[826] The Juniperus communis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[827] The Juniperus Lycia, and the Juniperus Phœnicia, probably, of\r\nLinnæus. It has been supposed by some, that it is these trees that\r\nproduce the frankincense of Africa; but, as Fée observes, the subject\r\nis enveloped in considerable obscurity.\r\n\r\n[828] The “sharp-leaved” cedar. The Juniperus oxycedrus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[829] The “Pinus cedrus” of Linnæus. The name “cedrus” was given by the\r\nancients not only to the cedar of Lebanon, but to many others of the\r\nConiferæ as well, and more particularly to several varieties of the\r\njuniper.\r\n\r\n[830] See B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[831] Pistacia terebinthus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[832] These varieties, Fée says, are not observed by modern naturalists.\r\n\r\n[833] Garidel has remarked, that the trunk of this tree produces\r\ncoriaceous vesicles, filled with a clear and odoriferous terebinthine,\r\nin which pucerons, or aphides, are to be seen floating.\r\n\r\n[834] “Rhus.” The Rhus coriaria of Linnæus. Pliny is wrong in\r\ndistinguishing this tree into sexes, as all the flowers are\r\nhermaphroditical, and therefore fruitful.\r\n\r\n[835] It is still used by curriers in preparing leather.\r\n\r\n[836] See B. xxiv. c. 79. The fruit, which has a pleasant acidity, was\r\nused for culinary purposes by the ancients, as it is by the Turks at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\n[837] The Ficus sycamorus of Linnæus. It receives its name from being\r\na fig-tree that bears a considerable resemblance to the “morus,” or\r\nmulberry-tree.\r\n\r\n[838] This is not the case.\r\n\r\n[839] This appears to be doubtful, although, as Fée says, the fruit\r\nripens but very slowly.\r\n\r\n[840] This, Fée says, is a fallacy.\r\n\r\n[841] “Aliam omnem.” This reading seems to be very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[842] This wood was very extensively used in Egypt for making the outer\r\ncases, or coffins, in which the mummies were enclosed.\r\n\r\n[843] This account is borrowed almost entirely from Theophrastus, Hist.\r\nPlant. B. iv. c. 2. A variety of the sycamore is probably meant. It is\r\nstill found in the Isle of Crete.\r\n\r\n[844] He seems to mean that the buds do not shoot forth into leaves;\r\nthe reading, however, varies in the editions, and is extremely doubtful.\r\n\r\n[845] Grossus.\r\n\r\n[846] The Ceratonia siliqua of Linnæus. It is of the same size as the\r\nsycamore, but resembles it in no other respect. It is still common in\r\nthe localities mentioned by Pliny, and in the south of Spain.\r\n\r\n[847] Theophrastus in the number, Hist. Plant. i. 23, and iv. 2.\r\nIt bears no resemblance to the fig-tree, and the fruit is totally\r\ndifferent from the fig. Pliny, too, is wrong in saying that it does not\r\ngrow in Egypt; the fact being that it is found there in great abundance.\r\n\r\n[848] See B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[849] Fée identifies it with the Egyptian almond, mentioned by Pliny\r\nin B. xv. c. 28; the Myrobalanus chebulus of Wesling, the Balanites\r\nÆgyptiaca of Delille, and the Xymenia Ægyptiaca of Linnæus. Schreber\r\nand Sprengel take it to be the Cordia Sebestana of Linnæus; but that\r\nis a tree peculiar to the Antilles. The fruit is in shape like a date,\r\nenclosing a large stone with five sides, and covered with a little\r\nviscous flesh, of somewhat bitter, though not disagreeable flavour. It\r\nis found in the vicinity of Sennaar, and near the Red Sea. The Arabs\r\ncall it the “date of the Desert.”\r\n\r\n[850] See B. xviii. c. 68.\r\n\r\n[851] See B. xv. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[852] Or ben. See B. xii. cc. 46, 47.\r\n\r\n[853] Many have taken this to be the cocoa-nut tree; but, as Fée\r\nremarks, that is a tree of India, and this of Egypt. There is little\r\ndoubt that it is the _doum_ of the Arabs, the Cucifera Thebaica of\r\nDelille. The timber of the trunk is much used in Egypt, and of the\r\nleaves carpets, bags, and panniers are made. In fact, the description\r\nof it and its fruit is almost identical with that here given by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[854] The seed or stone of the doum is still used in Egypt for making\r\nthe beads of chaplets: it admits of a very high polish.\r\n\r\n[855] Materies crispioris elegantiæ.\r\n\r\n[856] See B. xxiv. c. 67. This is, no doubt, the Acacia Nilotica of\r\nLinnæus, which produces the gum Arabic of modern commerce.\r\n\r\n[857] This is from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. iv. c. 3. Fée suggests\r\nthat it may have been a kind of myrobalanus. Sprengel identifies it\r\nwith the Cordia sebestana of the botanists.\r\n\r\n[858] “Fuit.” From the use of this word he seems uncertain as to its\r\nexistence in his time; the account is copied from Theophrastus, Hist.\r\nPlant. B. iv. c. 3. Fée suggests that he may here allude to the Baobab,\r\nthe Adansonia digitata, which grows in Senegal and Sennaar to an\r\nenormous size. Prosper Alpinus speaks of it as existing in Egypt. The\r\nArabs call it El-omarah, and the fruit El-kongles.\r\n\r\n[859] The Mimosa polyacanthe, probably. Fée says that the mimosæ,\r\nrespectively known as casta, pudibunda, viva, and sensitiva, with many\r\nof the inga, and other leguminous trees, are irritable in the highest\r\ndegree. The tree here spoken of he considers to be one of the acacias.\r\nThe passage in Theophrastus speaks of the leaf as shrinking, and not\r\nfalling, and then as simply reviving.\r\n\r\n[860] The Acacia Nilotica of Linnæus, from which we derive the gum\r\nArabic of commerce; and of which a considerable portion is still\r\nderived from Egypt.\r\n\r\n[861] These gums are chemically different from gum Arabic, and they are\r\nused for different purposes in the arts.\r\n\r\n[862] The vine does not produce a gum; but when the sap ascends, a\r\njuice is secreted, which sometimes becomes solid on the evaporation\r\nof the aqueous particles. This substance contains acetate of potassa,\r\nwhich, by the decomposition of that salt, becomes a carbonate of the\r\nsame base.\r\n\r\n[863] This is not a gum, but a resinous product of a peculiar nature.\r\nIt is known to the moderns by the name of “olivine.”\r\n\r\n[864] The sap of the elm leaves a saline deposit on the bark,\r\nprincipally formed of carbonate of potassa. Fée is at a loss to\r\nknow whether Pliny here alludes to this or to the manna which is\r\nincidentally formed by certain insects on some trees and reeds. But,\r\nas he justly says, would Pliny say of the latter that it is “ad nihil\r\nutile”—“good for nothing”?\r\n\r\n[865] A resinous product, no doubt. The frankincense of Africa has been\r\nattributed by some to the Juniperus Lycia and Phœnicia.\r\n\r\n[866] The Penæa Sarcocolla of Linnæus. The gum resin of this tree is\r\nstill brought from Abyssinia, but it is not used in medicine. This\r\naccount is from Dioscorides, B. iii. c. 99. The name is from the Greek\r\nσὰρξ, “flesh,” and κόλλα, “glue.”\r\n\r\n[867] See B. xxiv. c. 78.\r\n\r\n[868] Three denarii per pound.\r\n\r\n[869] It is hardly necessary to state that this is not the fact. This\r\nplant is the Cyperus papyrus of Linnæus, the “berd” of the modern\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\n[870] Il. B. vi. l. 168. See B. xxxiii. c. 4, where the tablets which\r\nare here called “pugillares,” are styled “codicilli” by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[871] His argument is, that paper made from the papyrus could not\r\nbe known in the time of Homer, as that plant only grew in certain\r\ndistricts which had been rescued from the sea since the time of the\r\npoet.\r\n\r\n[872] Od. B. iv. l. 355.\r\n\r\n[873] See B. ii. c. 87.\r\n\r\n[874] There is little doubt that parchment was really known many years\r\nbefore the time of Eumenes II., king of Pontus. It is most probable\r\nthat this king introduced extensive improvements in the manufacture\r\nof parchment, for Herodotus mentions writing on skins as common in\r\nhis time; and in B. v. c. 58, he states that the Ionians had been\r\naccustomed to give the name of skins, διφθέραι, to books.\r\n\r\n[875] Brachiali radicis obliquæ crassitudine.\r\n\r\n[876] This was a pole represented as being carried by Bacchus and his\r\nBacchanalian train. It was mostly terminated by the fir cone, that tree\r\nbeing dedicated to Bacchus, in consequence of the use of its cones and\r\nturpentine in making wine. Sometimes it is surmounted by vine or fig\r\nleaves, with grapes or berries arranged in form of a cone.\r\n\r\n[877] This is not the fact: it has seed in it, though not very easily\r\nperceptible. The description here given is otherwise very correct.\r\n\r\n[878] Among the ancients the term papyrus was used as a general\r\nappellation for all the different plants of the genus Cyperus, which\r\nwas used for making mats, boats, baskets, and numerous other articles:\r\nbut one species only was employed for making paper, the Cyperus\r\npapyrus, or Byblos. Fée states that the papyrus is no longer to be\r\nfound in the Delta, where it formerly abounded.\r\n\r\n[879] See B. xii. c. 48.\r\n\r\n[880] Sometimes translated _hemp_. A description will be given of it in\r\nB. xix. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[881] “Intexere.” This would almost appear to mean that they\r\nembroidered or interwove the characters. The Persians still write on a\r\nstuff made of white silk, gummed and duly prepared for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[882] Or “holy” paper. The priests would not allow it to be sold,\r\nlest it might be used for profane writing; but after it was once\r\nwritten upon, it was easily procurable. The Romans were in the habit\r\nof purchasing it largely in the latter state, and then washing off\r\nthe writing, and using it as paper of the finest quality. Hence it\r\nreceived the name of “Augustus,” as representing in Latin its Greek\r\nname “hieraticus,” or “sacred.” In length of time it became the common\r\nimpression, as here mentioned, that this name was given to it in honour\r\nof Augustus Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[883] Near the amphitheatre, probably, of Alexandria.\r\n\r\n[884] He alludes to Q. Remmius Fannius Palæmon, a famous grammarian\r\nof Rome, though originally a slave. Being manumitted, he opened a\r\nschool at Rome, which was resorted to by great numbers of pupils,\r\nnotwithstanding his notoriously bad character. He appears to have\r\nestablished, also, a manufactory for paper at Rome. Suetonius, in his\r\ntreatise on Illustrious Grammarians, gives a long account of him. He is\r\nsupposed to have been the preceptor of Quintilian.\r\n\r\n[885] Fanniana.\r\n\r\n[886] In Lower Egypt.\r\n\r\n[887] Ex vilioribus ramentis.\r\n\r\n[888] Of Alexandria, probably.\r\n\r\n[889] “Shop-paper,” or “paper of commerce.”\r\n\r\n[890] Otherwise, probably, the rope would not long hold together.\r\n\r\n[891] Fée remarks, that this is by no means the fact. With M. Poiret,\r\nhe questions the accuracy of Pliny’s account of preparing the papyrus,\r\nand is of opinion that it refers more probably to the treatment of some\r\nother vegetable substance from which paper was made.\r\n\r\n[892] Primo supinâ tabulæ schedâ.\r\n\r\n[893] “Scapus.” This was, properly, the cylinder on which the paper was\r\nrolled.\r\n\r\n[894] Augustan.\r\n\r\n[895] Or “long glued” paper: the breadth probably consisted of that of\r\ntwo or more sheets glued or pasted at the edges, the seam running down\r\nthe roll.\r\n\r\n[896] Scheda. One of the leaves of the papyrus, of which the roll of\r\ntwenty, joined side by side, was formed.\r\n\r\n[897] This passage is difficult to be understood, and various attempts\r\nhave been made to explain it. It is not unlikely that his meaning is\r\nthat the breadth being doubled, the tearing of one leaf or half breadth\r\nentailed of necessity the spoiling of another, making the corresponding\r\nhalf breadth.\r\n\r\n[898] He perhaps means a portion of an elephant’s tusk.\r\n\r\n[899] Meaning a damp, musty smell.\r\n\r\n[900] See B. vii. c. 18, and B. xiv. c. 6. Also the Life of Pliny, in\r\nthe Introduction to Vol. i. p. vii.\r\n\r\n[901] This story, no doubt, deserves to be rejected as totally\r\nfabulous, even though we have Hemina’s word for it.\r\n\r\n[902] See B. xvi. c. 70.\r\n\r\n[903] B. xii. c. 7, and B. xiii. c. 31. It was thought that the leaves\r\nand juices of the cedar and the citrus preserved books and linen from\r\nthe attacks of noxious insects.\r\n\r\n[904] And because, as Livy says, their doctrines were inimical to the\r\nthen existing religion.\r\n\r\n[905] Val. Maximus says that there were some books written in Latin, on\r\nthe pontifical rights, and others in Greek on philosophical subjects.\r\n\r\n[906] Humanæ Antiquitates.\r\n\r\n[907] See B. xxxiv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[908] See B. xxxiii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[909] He implies that it could not have been written upon paper, as the\r\npapyrus and the districts which produced it were not in existence in\r\nthe time of Homer. No doubt this so-called letter, if shown at all, was\r\na forgery, a “pia fraus.” See c. 21 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[910] Il. B. vi. l. 168.\r\n\r\n[911] “Codicillos,” as meaning characters written on a surface of wood.\r\nπίναξ, as Homer calls it.\r\n\r\n[912] It was probably then that the supply of it first began to fail;\r\nin the sixth century it was still used, but by the twelfth it had\r\nwholly fallen into disuse.\r\n\r\n[913] The cotton-tree, Gossypium arboreum of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[914] See B. xii. c. 21, 22.\r\n\r\n[915] In c. 9 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[916] See B. vi. c. 36, 37.\r\n\r\n[917] Desfontaines observed in the vicinity of Atlas, several trees\r\npeculiar to that district. Among others of this nature, he names the\r\nPistacia Atlantica, and the Thuya articulata.\r\n\r\n[918] See B. v. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[919] Generally supposed to be the Thuya articulata of Desfontaines,\r\nthe Cedrus Atlantica of other botanists.\r\n\r\n[920] This rage for fine tables made of the citrus is alluded to, among\r\nothers, by Martial and Petronius Arbiter. See also Lucan, A. ix. B.\r\n426, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[921] It is a rather curious fact that it is in Cicero’s works that\r\nwe find the earliest mention made of citrus tables, 2nd Oration ag.\r\nVerres, s. 4:—“You deprived Q. Lutatius Diodorus of Lilybæum of a\r\ncitrus table of remarkable age and beauty.”\r\n\r\n[922] Somewhere about £9000.\r\n\r\n[923] This is considered nothing remarkable at the present day, such is\r\nthe skill displayed by our cabinet-makers.\r\n\r\n[924] Called “Nomiana.”\r\n\r\n[925] Tuber.\r\n\r\n[926] The European Cyprus, the Cupressus sempervirens of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[927] These veins were nothing in reality but the lines of the layers\r\nor strata lignea, running perpendicularly in the trunk, and the number\r\nof which denotes the age of the tree.\r\n\r\n[928] “Tigrinæ.”\r\n\r\n[929] “Pantherinæ.” The former tables were probably made of small\r\npieces from the trunk, the latter from the sections of the tubers or\r\nknots.\r\n\r\n[930] “Crispis.”\r\n\r\n[931] Or “parsley-seed” tables. It has also been suggested that the\r\nword comes from “apis,” a bee; the wood presenting the appearance of\r\nbeing covered with swarms of bees.\r\n\r\n[932] “Mulsum.” This mixture will be found frequently mentioned in the\r\nnext Book.\r\n\r\n[933] Lignum.\r\n\r\n[934] Fée remarks that this is incorrect, and that this statement\r\nbetrays an entire ignorance of the vegetable physiology.\r\n\r\n[935] Θύον, “wood of sacrifice.”\r\n\r\n[936] Od. B. v. l. 60. Pliny makes a mistake in saying “Circe;” it\r\nshould be “Calypso.”\r\n\r\n[937] Θύον.\r\n\r\n[938] Crispius.\r\n\r\n[939] He alludes to the citron, the Citrus Medica of Linnæus. See B.\r\nxii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[940] The Rhamnus lotus of Linnæus; the Zizyphus lotus of Desfontaines.\r\n\r\n[941] The Celtis australis of Linnæus. Fée remarks that Pliny is in\r\nerror in giving the name of Celtis to the lotus of Africa.\r\n\r\n[942] The Lotophagi. See B. v. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[943] A kind of grain diet. See B. xviii. c. 29, and B. xxii. c. 61.\r\n\r\n[944] The Melilotus officinalis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[945] The Nymphæa Nelumbo of Linnæus, or Egyptian bean.\r\n\r\n[946] He speaks of the indentations on the surface of the poppy-head.\r\n\r\n[947] See B. xxii. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[948] Fée remarks that there is nothing singular about it, the sun more\r\nor less exercising a similar influence on all plants.\r\n\r\n[949] The same as the Nymphæa Nelumbo of the Nile, according to Fée.\r\n\r\n[950] Probably the Rhamnus paliurus of Linnæus; the Spina Christi of\r\nother botanists.\r\n\r\n[951] The pomegranate, the Punica granatum of botanists.\r\n\r\n[952] Or “grained apple.”\r\n\r\n[953] From the Greek ἀπύρηνον, “without kernel.” This Fée would not\r\ntranslate literally, but as meaning that by cultivation the grains had\r\nbeen reduced to a very diminutive size. See B. xxiii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[954] This variety appears to be extinct. Fée doubts if it ever existed.\r\n\r\n[955] See B. xxiii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[956] See B. xxiii. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[957] “Puniceus,” namely, a kind of purple.\r\n\r\n[958] See B. xxvii. c. 52. Sprengel thinks that this is the Neottia\r\nspiralis of Schwartz; but Fée is of opinion that it has not hitherto\r\nbeen identified.\r\n\r\n[959] Probably the Erica arborea of Linnæus, or “heath” in its several\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n[960] Granum Cnidium. The shrub is the Daphne Cnidium of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[961] The “thyme-olive.”\r\n\r\n[962] The “ground olive,” or “small olive.” Dioscorides makes a\r\ndistinction between these two last; and Sprengel has followed it,\r\nnaming the last Daphne Cnidium, and the first Daphne Cneorum.\r\n\r\n[963] See B. xxvii. c. 115.\r\n\r\n[964] He says elsewhere that it is like the juniper, which, however,\r\nis not the case. Guettard thinks that the tragion is the Androsæmon\r\nfetidum, the Hyperium hircinum of the modern botanists. Sprengel also\r\nadopts the same opinion. Fée is inclined to think that it was a variety\r\nof the Pistacia lentiscus.\r\n\r\n[965] Goat’s thorn. The Astragalus Creticus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[966] He speaks of gum tragacanth.\r\n\r\n[967] See B. xxvii. c. 116. Sprengel identifies it with the Salsola\r\ntragus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[968] Probably the Tamarix Gallica of Linnæus. Fée says, in relation\r\nto the myrica, that it would seem that the ancients united in one\r\ncollective name, several plants which resembled each other, not in\r\ntheir botanical characteristics, but in outward appearance. To this,\r\nhe says, is owing the fact that Dioscorides calls the myrica a tree,\r\nFavorinus a herb; Dioscorides says that it is fruitful, Nicander and\r\nPliny call it barren; Virgil calls it small, and Theophrastus says that\r\nit is large.\r\n\r\n[969] Fée thinks that it is the Tamarix orientalis of Delille.\r\n\r\n[970] “Infelix,” meaning “sterile.” He seems to say this more\r\nparticularly in reference to the brya, which Egypt produces. As to this\r\nuse of the word “infelix,” see B. xvi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[971] Sprengel and Fée identify this with the Ostrya vulgaris of\r\nWilldenow, the Carpinus ostrya of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[972] Or the “luckily named.” It grew on Mount Ordymnus in Lesbos. See\r\nTheophrastus, B. ii. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[973] The Evonymus Europæus, or else the Evonymus latifolius of\r\nbotanists, is probably intended to be indicated; but it is a mistake\r\nto say that it is poisonous to animals. On the contrary, Fée says that\r\nsheep will fatten on its leaves very speedily.\r\n\r\n[974] “Statim pestem denuntians.” Pliny appears to be in error here. In\r\ncopying from Theophrastus, he seems to have found the word φόνος used,\r\nreally in reference to a blood-red juice which distils from the plant;\r\nbut as the same word also means slaughter, or death, he seems to have\r\nthought that it really bears reference to the noxious qualities of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n[975] Fée censures the use of the word “siliqua,” as inappropriate,\r\nalthough the seed does resemble that of sesamum, the Sesamum orientale\r\nof Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[976] Or eonis. Fée suggests that in this story, which probably belongs\r\nto the region of Fable, some kind of oak may possibly be alluded to.\r\n\r\n[977] In the former editions, “adrachne”—the Arbutus integrifolia, Fée\r\nsays, and not the Arbutus andrachne of Linnæus, as Sprengel thinks.\r\n\r\n[978] “Porcillaca.” The Portulaca oleracea of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[979] The Rhus cotinus of Linnæus, a sort of sumach.\r\n\r\n[980] This is not the fact; the seeds when ripe are merely lost to view\r\nin the large tufts of down which grow on the stems.\r\n\r\n[981] Generally supposed to be the same as the alaternus, mentioned in\r\nB. xvi. c. 45. Some writers identify it with the Phyllirea angustifolia\r\nof Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[982] Probably the Ferula communis of Linnæus, the herb or shrub known\r\nas “fennel giant.”\r\n\r\n[983] The Ferula glauca of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[984] The Ferula nodiflora of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[985] It is still used for that purpose in the south of Europe. The\r\nRoman schoolmasters, as we learn from Juvenal, Martial, and others,\r\nemployed it for the chastisement of their scholars. Pliny is in error\r\nin reckoning it among the trees, it really having no pretensions to be\r\nconsidered such. It is said to have received its name from “ferio,” to\r\n“beat.”\r\n\r\n[986] Sprengel thinks that this is the Thapsia asclepium of the\r\nmoderns; but Fée takes it to be the Thapsia villosa of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[987] It was valued, Dioscorides says, for its cathartic properties.\r\n\r\n[988] Either the Thapsia garganica of Willdenow, or the Thapsia\r\nvillosa, found in Africa and the south of Europe, though, as Pliny\r\nsays, the thapsia of Europe is mild in its effects compared with that\r\nof Africa. It is common on the coast of Barbary.\r\n\r\n[989] Pastillos.\r\n\r\n[990] Nocturnis grassationibus.\r\n\r\n[991] It is still used in Barbary for the cure of tetter and ringworm.\r\n\r\n[992] The story was, that Prometheus, when he stole the heavenly fire\r\nfrom Jupiter, concealed it in a stalk of narthex.\r\n\r\n[993] The “caper-tree,” the Capparis spinosa of Linnæus. Fée\r\nsuggests that Pliny may possibly allude, in some of the features\r\nwhich he describes, to kinds less known; such, for instance, as the\r\nCapparis inermis of Forskhal, found in Arabia; the Capparis ovata of\r\nDesfontaines, found in Barbary; the Capparis Sinaica, found on Mount\r\nSinai, and remarkable for the size of its fruit; and the Capparis\r\nÆgyptiaca of Lamarck, commonly found in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[994] The stalk and seed were salted or pickled. The buds or unexpanded\r\nflowers of this shrub are admired as a pickle or sauce of delicate\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\n[995] Fée remarks that this is not the truth, all the kinds possessing\r\nthe same qualities. There may, however, have been some difference\r\nin the mode of salting or pickling them, and possibly productive of\r\nnoxious effects.\r\n\r\n[996] Probably from its thorns, that being the name of the sweet-briar,\r\nor dog-rose.\r\n\r\n[997] “Serpent grapes.”\r\n\r\n[998] Sprengel and Fée take this to be the Cyperus fastigiatus of\r\nLinnæus, which Forskhal found in the river Nile.\r\n\r\n[999] Spina regia. Some writers have considered this to be the same\r\nwith the Centaurea solstitialis of Linnæus. Sprengel takes it to be the\r\nCassyta filiformis of Linnæus, a parasitical plant of India. We must\r\nconclude, however, with Fée, that both the thorn and the parasite have\r\nnot hitherto been identified.\r\n\r\n[1000] The Makron Teichos. See B. iv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[1001] From the various statements of ancient authors, Fée has come\r\nto the conclusion that this name was given to two totally different\r\nproductions. The cytisus which the poets speak of as grateful to bees\r\nand goats, and sheep, he takes to be the Medicago arborea of Linnæus,\r\nknown to us as Medic trefoil, or lucerne; while the other, a tree with\r\na black wood, he considers identical with the Cytisus laburnum of\r\nLinnæus, the laburnum, or false ebony tree.\r\n\r\n[1002] A kind of vetch or tare. See B. xviii.\r\n\r\n[1003] “Frutex.” When speaking of it as a shrub, he seems to be\r\nconfounding the tree with the plant.\r\n\r\n[1004] Evidently in allusion to the tree.\r\n\r\n[1005] He alludes to various kinds of fucus or sea-weed, which grows to\r\na much larger size in the Eastern seas.\r\n\r\n[1006] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[1007] Whence the word “fucus” of the naturalists.\r\n\r\n[1008] Fée suggests that this may be the Laminaria saccharina of\r\nLinnæus, being one of the “ulvæ” often thrown up on the coasts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[1009] The “green” plant.\r\n\r\n[1010] The “girdle” plant.\r\n\r\n[1011] The Fucus barbatus, probably, of Linnæus, or else the Fucus\r\neroïdes.\r\n\r\n[1012] They are in reality more long-lived than this.\r\n\r\n[1013] Fée suggests that it is the Roccella tinctoria of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1014] The Zostera marina of Linnæus, according to Fée.\r\n\r\n[1015] The Ulva lactuca of the moderns, a very common sea-weed.\r\n\r\n[1016] The Fucus ericoïdes, Fée suggests, not unlike a fir in\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n[1017] Quercus. According to Gmellin, this is the Fucus vesiculosus of\r\nLinnæus. Its leaves are indented, somewhat similarly to those of the\r\noak.\r\n\r\n[1018] Polybius, as quoted by Athenæus, says that in the Lusitanian Sea\r\nthere are oaks that bear acorns, on which the thunnies feed and grow\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n[1019] On the contrary, Theophrastus says, B. iv. c. 7, that the\r\nsea-vine grows _near_ the sea, from which Fée is disposed to consider\r\nit a phanerogamous plant. If, on the other hand, it is really a fucus,\r\nhe thinks that the Fucus uvarius may be meant, the vesicles of which\r\nresemble a grape in shape.\r\n\r\n[1020] He speaks of a madrepore, Fée thinks, the identity of which it\r\nis difficult to determine. Professor Pallas speaks of an Alcyonidium\r\nficus, which lives in the Mediterranean and in the ocean, and which\r\nresembles a fig, and has no leaves, but its exterior is not red.\r\n\r\n[1021] Fée queries whether this may not be the Gorgonia palma of\r\nLinnæus, which has received its name from its resemblance to a small\r\npalm-tree.\r\n\r\n[1022] These three, Fée thinks, are madrepores or zoophytes, which it\r\nwould be vain to attempt to identify.\r\n\r\n[1023] That is, they dry up to the consistency of pumice.\r\n\r\n[1024] “Sitiens.” Delille considers this as identical with his Acacia\r\nseyal, a thorny tree, often to be seen in the deserts of Africa.\r\n\r\n[1025] Probably zoophytes now unknown.\r\n\r\n[1026] Fée suggests that he may allude to the Madrepora fungites of\r\nLinnæus, the Fungus lapideus of Bauhin. These are found in the Red Sea\r\nand the Indian Ocean; but, of course, the story of their appearance\r\nduring rain is fabulous.\r\n\r\n[1027] Sharks; see B. ix. c. 70.\r\n\r\n[1028] The companions of Onesicritus and Nearchus.\r\n\r\n[1029] Fée hazards a conjecture that this may be the Gorgonia scirpea\r\nof Pallas, found in the Indian Seas.\r\n\r\n[1030] One of the Gorgoniæ, Fée thinks; but its characteristics are not\r\nsufficiently stated to enable us to identify it.\r\n\r\n[1031] A fable worthy of Sinbad the Sailor!\r\n\r\n[1032] “Isidis crinem.” Fée says that this is evidently black coral,\r\nthe Gorgonia antipathes of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1033] “The eyelid of the Graces.” Fée is almost tempted to think that\r\nhe means red coral.\r\n\r\n[1034] Amatoriis.\r\n\r\n[1035] Spatalia. Armlets or bracelets.\r\n\r\n[1036] By this apparently fabulous story, one would be almost inclined\r\nto think that he is speaking of a zoophyte.\r\n\r\n[1037] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1038] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1039] See end of B vii.\r\n\r\n[1040] Papirius Fabianus.

It was known in very early times in Egypt and Greece, and\r\nit is now generally considered that it is indigenous throughout the\r\ntract that stretches to the south, from the mountains of Mazandiran on\r\nthe Caspian to the shores of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Sea, and\r\neastward through Khorassan and Cabul to the base of the Himalayas.\r\n\r\n[1098] The art of printing, Fée remarks, utterly precludes the\r\nrecurrence of such a fact as this.\r\n\r\n[1099] In allusion to his poem, the “Works and Days,” the prototype of\r\nVirgil’s Georgics.\r\n\r\n[1100] He alludes to the legacy-hunters with which Rome abounded in his\r\ntime. They are spoken of by Seneca, Tacitus, and Juvenal, in terms of\r\nsevere reprobation.\r\n\r\n[1101] This seems to be the meaning of “captatio;” much like what we\r\ncall “toadying,” or “toad-eating.”\r\n\r\n[1102] The “liberales artes,” were those, the pursuit of which was not\r\nconsidered derogatory to the dignity of a free man.\r\n\r\n[1103] Vita ipsa desiit.\r\n\r\n[1104] Humilitas.\r\n\r\n[1105] In the Georgics.\r\n\r\n[1106] Theophrastus reckons it among the trees; Columella, B. ii.,\r\nconsiders it to occupy a middle position between a tree and a shrub.\r\nHorace, B. i. Ode 18, calls it a tree, “arbor.”\r\n\r\n[1107] Or “layers,” “propagines.”\r\n\r\n[1108] Nubunt, properly “marry.” This is still done in Naples, and\r\nother parts of Italy. The use of vine stays there are unknown.\r\n\r\n[1109] “Mustum.” Pure, unfermented juice of the grape.\r\n\r\n[1110] See B. vii. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[1111] Italia Transpadana.\r\n\r\n[1112] See B. xxiv. c. 112. The Bauhins are of opinion that this is the\r\nAcer opulus of Willdenow, common in Italy, and very branchy.\r\n\r\n[1113] “Tabulata in orbem patula.” He probably alludes to the branches\r\nextending horizontally from the trunk.\r\n\r\n[1114] “In palmam ejus.”\r\n\r\n[1115] There is no doubt that the whole of this passage is in a most\r\ncorrupt state, and we can only guess at its meaning. Sillig suggests\r\na new reading, which, unsupported as it is by any of the MSS., can\r\nonly be regarded as fanciful, and perhaps as a very slight improvement\r\non the attempts to obtain a solution of the difficulty. Pliny’s main\r\nobject seems to be to contrast the vines that entwine round poles and\r\nrise perpendicularly with those that creep horizontally.\r\n\r\n[1116] By throwing out fresh shoots every here and there. Fée, however,\r\nseems to think that he means that the grapes themselves, as they trail\r\nalong the ground, suck up the juices with their pores. These are known\r\nin France as “running vines,” and are found in Berry and Anjou.\r\n\r\n[1117] He must evidently be speaking of the size of the _bunches_. See\r\nthe account of the grapes of Canaan, in Numbers xiii. 24.\r\n\r\n[1118] “Durus acinus,” or, according to some readings, “duracinus.”\r\n\r\n[1119] From the Greek βουμαστὸς, a cow’s teat, mentioned by Virgil,\r\nGeorg. ii. 102.\r\n\r\n[1120] Or finger-grape.\r\n\r\n[1121] From the Greek λεπτορᾶγες, “small-berried.”\r\n\r\n[1122] Pensili concamaratæ nodo.\r\n\r\n[1123] We have no corresponding word for the Latin “dolium.” It was an\r\noblong earthen vessel, used for much the same purpose as our vats; new\r\nwine was generally placed in it. In times later than that of Pliny the\r\ndolia were made of wood.\r\n\r\n[1124] Hardouin speaks of these grapes as still growing in his time in\r\nthe Valtelline, and remarkable for their excellence.\r\n\r\n[1125] “A patientia.” Because they have _suffered_ from the action of\r\nthe heat.\r\n\r\n[1126] From the thinness of the skin.\r\n\r\n[1127] See c. 24, also B. xxiii. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[1128] See B. iii. c. 5, and B. xxxiii. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[1129] He died in the year B.C. 19.\r\n\r\n[1130] A vine sapling was the chief mark of the centurion’s authority.\r\n\r\n[1131] The reading “elatas,” has been adopted. If “lentas” is retained,\r\nit may mean, “promotion, slow though it be,” for the word “aquila” was\r\noften used to denote the rank of the “primipilus,” who had the charge\r\nof the eagle of the legion.\r\n\r\n[1132] Because it was the privilege solely of those soldiers who were\r\nRoman citizens to be beaten with the vine sapling.\r\n\r\n[1133] He alludes to the “vinea” used in besieging towns; the first\r\nnotion of which was derived from the leafy roof afforded by the vines\r\nwhen creeping on the trellis over-head. It was a moveable machine,\r\naffording a roof under which the besiegers protected themselves against\r\ndarts, stones, fire, and other missiles. Raw hides or wet cloths\r\nconstituted the uppermost layer.\r\n\r\n[1134] See B. xxiii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1135] Many years ago, there were in the gardens of the Luxembourg one\r\nthousand four hundred varieties of the French grape, and even then\r\nthere were many not to be found there; while, at the same time, it was\r\nconsidered that the French kinds did not form more than one-twentieth\r\npart of the species known in Europe.\r\n\r\n[1136] This vine was said to be of Grecian origin, and to have been\r\nconveyed by a Thessalian tribe to Italy, where it was grown at Aminea,\r\na village in the Falernian district of Campania. It is supposed to\r\nhave been the same as the _gros plant_ of the French. The varieties\r\nmentioned by Pliny seem not to have been recognized by the moderns.\r\n\r\n[1137] Fée does not give credit to this statement.\r\n\r\n[1138] In allusion to the cotton-tree, or else the mulberry leaves\r\ncovered with the cocoons of the silkworm. See B. vi. c. 20, and B. xii.\r\nc. 21. Virgil, in the Georgics, has the well-known line:\r\n\r\n  “Velleraque ut foliis depectant tenuia Seres.”\r\n\r\n[1139] See B. iii. c. 9, There are many vines, the wood of which is\r\nred, but this species has not been identified.\r\n\r\n[1140] From “apis,” a “bee.” He alludes, it is thought, to the muscatel\r\ngrape, said to have had its name from “musca,” a “fly;” an insect which\r\nis greatly attracted by its sweetness.\r\n\r\n[1141] Græcula.\r\n\r\n[1142] Fée is inclined to think that he alludes to the vine of Corinth,\r\nthe dried fruit of which are the currants of commerce.\r\n\r\n[1143] From the Greek εὐγένεια.\r\n\r\n[1144] How Taormina, in Sicily, where, Fée says, it is still to be\r\nfound. The grapes are red, similar to those of Mascoli near Etna, and\r\nmuch esteemed.\r\n\r\n[1145] Picata. See p. 221.\r\n\r\n[1146] _I. e._, pale straw colour.\r\n\r\n[1147] It has been supposed that this vine received its name from\r\n“fæx;” the wine depositing an unusually large quantity of lees.\r\n\r\n[1148] It is doubtful whether this vine had its name from being grown\r\nin the district now called Bourges, or that of Bourdeaux. Dalechamps\r\nidentifies it with the _plant d’Orleans_.\r\n\r\n[1149] The origin of its name is unknown. The text is evidently\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\n[1150] By this name it would be understood that they were of an\r\nintermediate colour between rose and white, a not uncommon colour in\r\nthe grape. Pliny, however, says otherwise, and he is supported by\r\nColumella.\r\n\r\n[1151] C. Bauhin took this to mean one of the garden currant trees,\r\nthe Ribes uva crispa of Linnæus, called by Bauhin Grossularia simplici\r\nacino, or else Spinosa agrestis. But, as Fée observes, the ancients\r\nwere not so ignorant as to confound a vine with a currant-bush.\r\n\r\n[1152] Like the Portuguese grapes of the present day.\r\n\r\n[1153] Crisped and indented.\r\n\r\n[1154] This variety, according to Christian de la Vega, was cultivated\r\nabundantly in Grenada. The word _cocolab_, according to some, meant\r\ncock’s comb. It is mentioned as a Spanish word by Columella.\r\n\r\n[1155] Dalechamps says, that a similar wine was made at Montpellier,\r\nand that it was called “piquardant.”\r\n\r\n[1156] See B. xxiii. cc. 20, 21.\r\n\r\n[1157] Probably from “albus,” “white.” Poinsinet thinks that it may\r\nhave been so called from the Celtic word _alb_, or _alp_, a mountain,\r\nand that it grew on elevated spots. This, however, is probably fanciful.\r\n\r\n[1158] Called by the Greeks ἀμέθυστον, from its comparatively harmless\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n[1159] Or “sober” vine.\r\n\r\n[1160] Hardouin says that in his time it was still cultivated about\r\nMacerata, in the Roman States. Fée thinks that it may be one of the\r\nclimbing vines, supported by forks, cultivated in the central provinces\r\nof France. See also B. xxiii. c. 19, as to the effects produced by its\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n[1161] Poinsinet gives a Celto-Scythian origin to this word, and says\r\nthat it means “injured by fogs.” This appears to be supported in some\r\nmeasure by what is stated below.\r\n\r\n[1162] See B. xvii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[1163] Or “thorny” vine. Fée queries why it should be thus called.\r\n\r\n[1164] This humid, marshy locality was noted for the badness of its\r\ngrapes, and consequently of its wine.\r\n\r\n[1165] Hardouin thinks that this is the “Marze mina” of the Venetians:\r\nwhence, perhaps, its ancient name.\r\n\r\n[1166] “Testis.” See B. xxxv. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[1167] From Murgentum, in Sicily. See B. iii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[1168] From Pompeii, afterwards destroyed. See B. iii c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1169] Hardouin, as Fée thinks, without good reason, identifies this\r\nwith the “Arelaca” of Columella.\r\n\r\n[1170] Georgics, ii. 99.\r\n\r\n[1171] This seems to be the meaning of “ultro solum lætius facit.”\r\nThese two lines have been introduced by Sillig, from one of the MSS.,\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\n[1172] Hardouin thinks that it is so called from Tuder, a town of\r\nEtruria. See B. iii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1173] Sillig suggests that the reading here is corrupt, and that Pliny\r\nmeans to say that the vine called Florentia is particularly excellent,\r\nand merely to state that the talpona, &c., are peculiar to Arretium:\r\nfor, as he says, speaking directly afterwards in disparagement of\r\nthem, it is not likely he would pronounce them “opima,” of “first-rate\r\nquality.”\r\n\r\n[1174] From “talpa,” a “mole,” in consequence of its black colour.\r\n\r\n[1175] “Album.”\r\n\r\n[1176] Probably so called from the Etesian winds, which improved its\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n[1177] Perhaps meaning “double-seeded.” We may here remark, that the\r\nwines of Tuscany, though held in little esteem in ancient times, are\r\nhighly esteemed at the present day.\r\n\r\n[1178] The leaves of most varieties turn red just before the fall.\r\n\r\n[1179] And Baccius thinks that this is the kind from which the raisins\r\nof the sun, common in Italy, and more particularly in the Valley of\r\nBevagna, the Mevania of Pliny, are made.\r\n\r\n[1180] Perhaps from “pumilio,” a dwarf.\r\n\r\n[1181] The “royal” vine, according to Poinsinet, who would derive it\r\nfrom the Sclavonic “ban.”\r\n\r\n[1182] Previously mentioned, p. 228.\r\n\r\n[1183] The residence of Horace, now Tivoli.\r\n\r\n[1184] Baccius says that the wine of this grape was thin like water,\r\nand that the vine was trained on lofty trees, a mode of cultivation\r\nstill followed in the vicinity of Rome. Laurentum was situate within a\r\nshort distance of it, near Ostia.\r\n\r\n[1185] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1186] So called from the smoky or intermediate colour of its grapes.\r\nFée suggests that this may be the slow-ripening grape of France, called\r\nthe “verjus,” or “rognon de coq.”\r\n\r\n[1187] Possibly meaning the “mouthful.”\r\n\r\n[1188] Perhaps so called from Prusa in Bithynia, a district which bore\r\nexcellent grapes.\r\n\r\n[1189] Or the “turning” grape. A fabulous story no doubt, originating\r\nin the name, probably. Fée suggests that it may have originated in the\r\nnot uncommon practice of letting the bunches hang after they were ripe,\r\nand then twisting them, which was thought to increase the juice.\r\n\r\n[1190] In the modern Marches of Ancona.\r\n\r\n[1191] Georgics, ii. 91, _et seq._\r\n\r\n  Sunt Thasiæ vites, sunt et Mareotides albæ:\r\n  *       *       *       *       *\r\n  Et passo Psithia utilior, tenuisque Lageos,\r\n  Tentatura pedes olim, vincturaque linguam,\r\n  Purpuræ, Preciæque——\r\n\r\n[1192] A muscatel, Fée thinks.\r\n\r\n[1193] Or “hard-berried.” Fée thinks that the maroquin, or Morocco\r\ngrape, called the “pied de poule” (or fowl’s foot), at Montpellier, may\r\nbe the duracinus.\r\n\r\n[1194] Or “upright vine.” In Anjou and Herault the vines are of similar\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[1195] The “finger-like” vine.\r\n\r\n[1196] The “pigeon” vine.\r\n\r\n[1197] Though very fruitful, it does not bear in large clusters\r\n(racemi), but only in small bunches (uvæ).\r\n\r\n[1198] The “three-foot” vine.\r\n\r\n[1199] Perhaps meaning the “rush” grape, from its shrivelled appearance.\r\n\r\n[1200] See c. 3 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1201] The ordinary number of pips or stones is five. It is seldom that\r\nwe find but one. Virgil mentions this grape, Georg. ii. 95.\r\n\r\n[1202] “Chium.” This reading is doubtful. Fée says that between Narni\r\nand Terni, eight leagues from Spoleto, a small grape is found, without\r\nstones. It is called “uva passa,” or “passerina.” So, too, the Sultana\r\nraisin of commerce.\r\n\r\n[1203] “Grown for the table.”\r\n\r\n[1204] Or “hard-berry.”\r\n\r\n[1205] Mentioned by Virgil, Georg. ii. 101.\r\n\r\n[1206] Or pitch-grape.\r\n\r\n[1207] Perhaps the “noirant,” or “teinturier” of the French.\r\n\r\n[1208] Or “garland-clustered” vine.\r\n\r\n[1209] Fée says that this is sometimes accidentally the case, but is\r\nnot the characteristic of any variety now known.\r\n\r\n[1210] Or “market-grapes.”\r\n\r\n[1211] The “ash-coloured.”\r\n\r\n[1212] The “russet-coloured.”\r\n\r\n[1213] Probably so called from its grey colour, like that of the ass.\r\n\r\n[1214] Or “fox” vine. This variety is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1215] So called from Alexandria, in Troas, not in Egypt. Phalacra was\r\nin the vicinity of Mount Ida.\r\n\r\n[1216] As the leaves of the vine are universally divided, it has been\r\nconsidered by many of the commentators that this is not in reality a\r\nvine, but the Arbutus uva ursi of Linnæus. The fruit, however, of that\r\nericaceous plant is remarkably acrid, and not sweet, as Pliny states.\r\nFée rejects this solution.\r\n\r\n[1217] Aubenas, in the Vivarais, according to Hardouin; Alps, according\r\nto Brotier. We must reject this assertion as fabulous.\r\n\r\n[1218] In B.C. 194, for his successes in Spain.\r\n\r\n[1219] Mode of culture, locality, climate, and other extraneous\r\ncircumstances, work, no doubt, an entire change in the nature of the\r\nvine.\r\n\r\n[1220] Probably the first of the five that he has mentioned in c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1221] He has only mentioned one sort in c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1222] See c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1223] See c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1224] We have no corresponding word for this beverage in the English\r\nlanguage—a thin, poor liquor, made by pouring water on the husks and\r\nstalks after being fully pressed, allowing them to soak, pressing\r\nthem again, and then fermenting the liquor. It was also called “vinum\r\noperarium,” or “labourer’s wine.” As stated in the present instance,\r\ngrapes were sometimes stored in it for keeping.\r\n\r\n[1225] A variety of the Aminean, as stated below.\r\n\r\n[1226] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1227] The elder Africanus. He retired in voluntary exile to his\r\ncountry-seat at Liternum, where he died.\r\n\r\n[1228] Mercis.\r\n\r\n[1229] The suggestion of Sillig has been adopted, for the ordinary\r\nreading is evidently corrupt, and absurd as well—“not in the very worst\r\npart of a favourite locality”—just the converse of the whole tenor of\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\n[1230] The philosopher, and tutor of Nero.\r\n\r\n[1231] Said to have been so called from Maron, a king of Thrace, who\r\ndwelt in the vicinity of the Thracian Ismarus. See B. iv. c. 18. Homer\r\nmentions this wine in the Odyssey, B. ix. c. 197, _et seq._ It was red,\r\nhoney-sweet, fragrant. The place is still called Marogna, in Roumelia,\r\na country the wines of which are still much esteemed.\r\n\r\n[1232] See B. vii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[1233] Thus making “mulsum.”\r\n\r\n[1234] B. ix. c. 208.\r\n\r\n[1235] Indomitus.\r\n\r\n[1236] By “black” wines he means those that had the same colour as our\r\nport.\r\n\r\n[1237] Il. xi. 638. Od. x. 234.\r\n\r\n[1238] Cybele. A wine called “Pramnian” was also grown in the island\r\nof Icaria, in Lesbos, and in the territory of Ephesus. The scholiast\r\non Nicander says that the grape of the psythia was used in making it.\r\nDioscorides says that it was a “protropum,” first-class wine, made of\r\nthe juice that voluntarily flowed from the grapes, in consequence of\r\ntheir own pressure.\r\n\r\n[1239] B.C. 121.\r\n\r\n[1240] “Cooking,” literally, or “boiling.”\r\n\r\n[1241] The wines of Burgundy, in particular, become bitter when\r\nextremely old.\r\n\r\n[1242] See B. vii. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[1243] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[1244] By some remarkable and peculiar quality, such as in the Opimian\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n[1245] “Testa,” meaning the amphora.\r\n\r\n[1246] See c. 3 of the present Book, where these “picata,” or\r\n“pitched-wines,” have been further described.\r\n\r\n[1247] On the contrary, Fée says, the coldest wines are those that\r\ncontain the least alcohol, whereas those of Vienne (in modern Dauphiné)\r\ncontain more than the majority of wines.\r\n\r\n[1248] He implies that wine is an antidote to the poisonous effects\r\nof hemlock. This is not the case, but it is said by some that vinegar\r\nis. It is the plant hemlock (cicuta) that is meant, and not the fatal\r\ndraught that was drunk by Socrates and Philopœmen. See further in B.\r\nxxiii. c. 23, and B. xxv. c. 95.\r\n\r\n[1249] Clitus and Callisthenes.\r\n\r\n[1250] Lacus.\r\n\r\n[1251] The testa or amphora, made of earth.\r\n\r\n[1252] As the wife of Augustus is meant, this reading appears\r\npreferable to “Julia.”\r\n\r\n[1253] Dion Cassius says “eighty-sixth.”\r\n\r\n[1254] See B. iii. c. 22, and B. xvii. c. 3. Pucinum was in Istria,\r\nand the district is said still to produce good wine; according to\r\nDalechamps, the place is called Pizzino d’Istria.\r\n\r\n[1255] The hills of Setia, looking down on the Pomptine Marshes: now\r\nSezza, the wine of which is of no repute.\r\n\r\n[1256] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1257] See B. iii. c. 9. Between Fundi and Setia; a locality now of no\r\nrepute for its wines. In B. xxiii. c. 19, Pliny says, that the Cæcuban\r\nvine was extinct: but in B. xvii. c. 3, he says that in the Pomptine\r\nMarshes it was to be found.\r\n\r\n[1258] This was the case, it has been remarked, with Madeira some years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[1259] This is the most celebrated of all the ancient wines, as being\r\nmore especially the theme of the poets.\r\n\r\n[1260] See B. xi. c. 97. The wines of the Falernian district are no\r\nlonger held in any esteem; indeed, all the Campanian wines are sour,\r\nand of a disagreeable flavour.\r\n\r\n[1261] It appears to have been exceedingly rich in alcohol.\r\n\r\n[1262] But in B. xxiii. c. 20, he assigns the first rank to the\r\nAlbanum; possibly, however, as a medicinal wine. The wines of Latium\r\nare no longer held in esteem.\r\n\r\n[1263] See B. xxiii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[1264] From Surrentum, the promontory forming the southern horn of the\r\nBay of Naples. Ovid and Martial speak in praise of these wines; they\r\nwere destitute of richness and very dry, in consequence of which they\r\nrequired twenty-five years to ripen.\r\n\r\n[1265] Or “dead vinegar.” “Vappa” was vinegar exposed to the air, and\r\nso destitute of its properties, and quite insipid.\r\n\r\n[1266] Excellent wines are still produced in the vicinity of this\r\nplace. Massicum was one of the perfumed wines. Gaurus itself produced\r\nthe “Gauranum,” in small quantity, but of high quality, full-bodied and\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n[1267] For the Calenian Hills, see B. iii. c. 9; see also B. xxiii. c.\r\n12, for some further account of the wines of Stata. The wines of that\r\ndistrict are now held in no esteem.\r\n\r\n[1268] From Fundi. See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1269] Now Castel del Volturno: although covered with vineyards, its\r\nwines are of no account. This wine always tasted as if mixed with some\r\nforeign substance.\r\n\r\n[1270] Now Piperno. It was a thin and pleasant wine.\r\n\r\n[1271] Now Segni, in the States of the Church.\r\n\r\n[1272] Written to the Senate, also to Cicero. We learn from Suetonius\r\nthat they were partly written in cipher.\r\n\r\n[1273] Messina, at the present day, exports wines of very good quality,\r\nand which attain a great age.\r\n\r\n[1274] It was sound, light, and not without body.\r\n\r\n[1275] “Lagenæ.” The same spot, now Taormina in Sicily, between Catania\r\nand Messina, still produces excellent wines.\r\n\r\n[1276] See B. iii. c. 18. Fée says that this is thought to have been\r\nthe wine of Syrol, of last century, grown near Ancona.\r\n\r\n[1277] “Palma.” Notwithstanding this suggestion, it is more generally\r\nsupposed that they had their name from the place called Palma, near\r\nMarano, on the Adriatic. Its wines are still considered of agreeable\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\n[1278] The wines of modern Cezena enjoy no repute, owing, probably, to\r\nthe mode of making them.\r\n\r\n[1279] Probably so called because it was brought into fashion by\r\nMæcenas.\r\n\r\n[1280] See Georg. ii. 95. The wines of the Tyrol, the ancient Rhætia,\r\nare still considered as of excellent quality.\r\n\r\n[1281] Of Adria, or the Adriatic Sea.\r\n\r\n[1282] See B. iii. c. 20. These wines are of little repute.\r\n\r\n[1283] In Latium. See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1284] From Graviscæ. See B. iii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[1285] See B. ii. c. 96, B. iii. c. 9, and B. xxxvi. c. 49.\r\n\r\n[1286] The wines of Genoa are of middling quality only, and but little\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[1287] Or “juicy” wine.\r\n\r\n[1288] Now Beziers, in the south of France. The wines of this part are\r\nconsidered excellent at the present day. That of Frontignan grows in\r\nits vicinity. Fée is inclined to think, from Pliny’s remarks here, that\r\nthe ancients and the moderns differed entirely in their notions as to\r\nwhat constitutes good or bad wine.\r\n\r\n[1289] He means, beyond modern Provence, and Languedoc: districts\r\nfamous for their excellent wines, more particularly the latter.\r\n\r\n[1290] Fée deems all this quite incredible. Our English experience,\r\nhowever, tells us that it is by no means so; much of the wine that is\r\ndrunk in this country is indebted for flavour as well as colour to\r\nanything but the grape.\r\n\r\n[1291] The wines of modern Otranto are ordinarily of good quality.\r\n\r\n[1292] Baccius reads “Seberiniana,” but is probably wrong. If he is\r\nnot, it might allude to the place now known as San Severino, and which\r\nproduces excellent wine. Fée thinks that these wines were grown in the\r\nterritory of Salerno, which still enjoys celebrity for its muscatel\r\nwines.\r\n\r\n[1293] See B. iii. c. 10. The wines of modern Cosenza still enjoy a\r\nhigh reputation.\r\n\r\n[1294] M. Valerius Messala Corvinus, the writer and partisan of\r\nAugustus. See end of B. ix.\r\n\r\n[1295] A place supposed to have been situated near Thurii.\r\n\r\n[1296] See B. iii. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[1297] Said by Galen to be very wholesome, as well as pleasant. The\r\nwines of the vicinity of Naples are still held in high esteem.\r\n\r\n[1298] Galen says that it was very similar to the Falernian.\r\n\r\n[1299] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1300] The Trifoline territory was in the vicinity of Cumæ. It is\r\npossible that the wine may have had its name from taking three years to\r\ncome to maturity; or possibly it was owing to some peculiarity in the\r\nvine.\r\n\r\n[1301] They have been already mentioned in c. 4. See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1302] Twelve o’clock in the day.\r\n\r\n[1303] See B. iii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1304] In Catalonia, which still produces abundance of wine, but in\r\ngeneral of inferior repute.\r\n\r\n[1305] The wines of Tarragona are still considered good.\r\n\r\n[1306] A place in the province of Hispania Tarraconensis, destroyed by\r\nSertorius.\r\n\r\n[1307] They still enjoy a high repute. The fame of their Malvoisie has\r\nextended all over the world.\r\n\r\n[1308] He means to illustrate the capricious tastes that existed as to\r\nthe merits of wines.\r\n\r\n[1309] In c. 6 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1310] The Chian held the first rank, the Thasian the second.\r\n\r\n[1311] From Arvisium, or Ariusium, a hilly district in the centre of\r\nthe island. The wine of Chios still retains its ancient celebrity.\r\n\r\n[1312] It was remarkable for its sweetness, and aromatics were\r\nsometimes mixed with it. Homer calls it harmless. Lesbos still produces\r\nchoice wines.\r\n\r\n[1313] Near Smyrna. Probably similar to the Pramnian wine, mentioned in\r\nc. 6.\r\n\r\n[1314] See B. v. c. 30. This wine is mentioned again in the next page;\r\nit is generally thought, that he is wrong in making the Tmolites and\r\nthe Mesogites distinct wines, for they are supposed to have been\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\n[1315] If drunk by itself, and not as a flavouring for other wines.\r\n\r\n[1316] Bacchus had a temple there.\r\n\r\n[1317] The wines of Cyprus are the most choice of all the Grecian wines\r\nat the present day.\r\n\r\n[1318] In Lycia.\r\n\r\n[1319] In Syria. Wine is no longer made there, but the grapes are\r\nexcellent, and are dried for raisins.\r\n\r\n[1320] Now Beyrout. It does not seem that wine is made there now. The\r\nMahometan religion may have tended to the extinction of many of these\r\nwines.\r\n\r\n[1321] At the village of Sour, on the site of ancient Tyre, the grape\r\nis only cultivated for raisins.\r\n\r\n[1322] See also c. 22: probably introduced from Thasos.\r\n\r\n[1323] The “smoky” grape.\r\n\r\n[1324] The “pitchy” grape.\r\n\r\n[1325] A strong wine, Hardouin thinks, from whence its name—“strong\r\nenough to subdue a horse.”\r\n\r\n[1326] From the small island of Mystus, near Cephallenia.\r\n\r\n[1327] So called from the vine the name of which was “canthareus.”\r\n\r\n[1328] Made, as already stated, from the juice that flowed\r\nspontaneously from the grapes. See also p. 250.\r\n\r\n[1329] Or the “burnt up” country, a volcanic district of Mysia, which\r\nstill retains its ancient fame for its wine. Virgil alludes to this\r\nwine in Georg. iv. l. 380:—\r\n\r\n  —Cape Mæonii carchesia Bacchi.\r\n\r\n[1330] Perhaps from Petra in Arabia: though Fée suggests Petra in the\r\nBalearic Islands.\r\n\r\n[1331] See B. iv. c. 22. In the island of Myconos in the Archipelago an\r\nexcellent wine is still grown.\r\n\r\n[1332] From Mount Mesogis, which divides the tributaries of the Caÿster\r\nfrom those of the Meander. It is generally considered the same as the\r\nTmolites.\r\n\r\n[1333] Must or grape-juice boiled down to one half.\r\n\r\n[1334] See B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[1335] “Mulsum,” or honied wine, was of two kinds; honey mixed with\r\nwine, and honey mixed with must or grape-juice.\r\n\r\n[1336] From its Greek name, it would seem to mean “of first quality.”\r\n\r\n[1337] So called from a place in Eubœa, the modern Negropont. See. B.\r\niv. c. 20. Negropont produces good wines at the present day.\r\n\r\n[1338] The locality is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1339] From Leucadia, or Leucate; see B. iv. c. 2; the vine was very\r\nabundant there.\r\n\r\n[1340] From Ambracia. See B. iv. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[1341] From the island of Peparethus. See B. iv. c. 23, where he says\r\nthat from its abundance of vines it was called εὐοινὸς, or “Evenus.”\r\n\r\n[1342] B. xxiii. c. 1, and c. 26.\r\n\r\n[1343] “Cadis.”\r\n\r\n[1344] Fée remarks that this method is still adopted in making several\r\nof the liqueurs.\r\n\r\n[1345] White wine of Cos. Fée thinks that Pliny means to say that the\r\nsea water turns the must of a white or pale straw colour, and is of\r\nopinion that he has been wrongly informed.\r\n\r\n[1346] “Sea-water” wine.\r\n\r\n[1347] “Sea-seasoned” wine.\r\n\r\n[1348] Fée says, that if the vessels were closed hermetically this\r\nwould have little or no appreciable effect; if not, it would tend to\r\nspoil the wine.\r\n\r\n[1349] Athenæus says that the Rhodian wine will not mix so well with\r\nsea-water as the Coan. Fée remarks that if Cato’s plan were followed,\r\nthe wine would become vinegar long before the end of the four years.\r\n\r\n[1350] Sillig thinks that the proper reading is “in six” only.\r\n\r\n[1351] The sweet wines, in modern times, have the most bouquet or aroma.\r\n\r\n[1352] “Albus,” pale straw-colour.\r\n\r\n[1353] “Fulvus,” amber-colour.\r\n\r\n[1354] Bright and glowing, like Tent and Burgundy.\r\n\r\n[1355] “Niger,” the colour of our port.\r\n\r\n[1356] Supposed to be a species of Pramnian wine, mentioned in c. 6.\r\nThis was used, as also the Aminean, for making omphacium, as mentioned\r\nin B. xii. c. 60. See also c. 18 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1357] “Black psythian.”\r\n\r\n[1358] Mentioned by Galen among the sweet wines.\r\n\r\n[1359] See B. iii. c. 14. Now Solana in Sicily, which produces\r\nexcellent wine.\r\n\r\n[1360] Honied wine.\r\n\r\n[1361] This was evidently a kind of grape sirop, or grape jelly. “Rob”\r\nis perhaps, as Hardouin suggests, a not inappropriate name for it.\r\n\r\n[1362] When cold, they would have nearly the same consistency.\r\n\r\n[1363] The raisin wine of Crete was the most prized of all as a class.\r\n\r\n[1364] Mentioned in c. 4. Probably a muscatel grape.\r\n\r\n[1365] See c. 4 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1366] Or “vat.” The common reading was “oleo,” which would imply\r\nthat they were plunged into boiling oil. Columella favours the latter\r\nreading, B. xii. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[1367] The reading is probably defective here.\r\n\r\n[1368] Passum secundarium.\r\n\r\n[1369] Or “always sweet.”\r\n\r\n[1370] “Always must.”\r\n\r\n[1371] Fervere, “boil,” or “effervesce.”\r\n\r\n[1372] “Sweet” drink. Fée seems to think that this sweet wine must have\r\nbeen something similar to champagne. Hardouin says that it corresponds\r\nto the vin doux de Limoux, or blanquette de Limoux, and the vin Muscat\r\nd’Azile.\r\n\r\n[1373] See c. 3 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1374] “Poured,” or “strained through.”\r\n\r\n[1375] “Honey wine.” A disagreeable medicament, Fée thinks, rather than\r\na wine.\r\n\r\n[1376] Somewhat similar to the vin de premiere goutte of the French. It\r\nwould seem to have been more of a liqueur than a wine. Tokay is made in\r\na somewhat similar manner.\r\n\r\n[1377] Or “second” press wines.\r\n\r\n[1378] De Re Rust. c. 153.\r\n\r\n[1379] Vinum operarium.\r\n\r\n[1380] This method is still adopted, Fée says, in making “piquette,” or\r\n“small wine,” throughout most of the countries of Europe.\r\n\r\n[1381] Or “wine-lee drink.” It would make an acid beverage, of\r\ndisagreeable taste.\r\n\r\n[1382] “Nobilia.” In c. 29 he speaks of 195 kinds, and, reckoning all\r\nthe varieties, double that number.\r\n\r\n[1383] Fée observes that the varieties of the modern wines are quite\r\ninnumerable. He remarks also that Pliny does not speak of the Asiatic\r\nwines mentioned by Athenæus, which were kept in large bottles, hung\r\nin the chimney corner; where the liquid, by evaporation, acquired the\r\nconsistency of salt. The wines of other countries evidently were little\r\nknown to Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1384] “Circa pericula arbusti.” This is probably the meaning of this\r\nvery elliptical passage. See p. 218.\r\n\r\n[1385] Called Metellus, by Valerius Maximus, B. vi. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[1386] See B. xvii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[1387] Over the Celtiberi.\r\n\r\n[1388] The younger Pliny, B. ii. Ep. 2, censures this stingy practice.\r\nSee also Martial, B. iii. Epig. 60.\r\n\r\n[1389] That this, however, was not uncommonly done, we may judge from\r\nthe remark made by the governor of the feast, John ii. 10, to the\r\nbridegroom.\r\n\r\n[1390] Called “myrrhina.” Fée remarks that the flavour of myrrh is\r\nacrid and bitter, its odour strong and disagreeable, and says that it\r\nis difficult to conceive how the ancients could drink wine with this\r\nsubstance in solution.\r\n\r\n[1391] As the “Persa” has come down to us, we find no mention of myrrh\r\nin the passage alluded to.\r\n\r\n[1392] See B. xii. c. 49. This is mentioned in the Persa, A. i. sc. 3,\r\nl. 7.\r\n\r\n[1393] Aromatic or perfumed wines.\r\n\r\n[1394] Murrhinam.\r\n\r\n[1395] The Cheat or Impostor: a play of Plautus. See A. ii. sc. 4, l.\r\n51, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1396] Must boiled down to half its original quantity.\r\n\r\n[1397] Apothecas. The “apothecæ” were rooms at the top of the house,\r\nin which the wines were placed for the purpose of seasoning. Sometimes\r\na current of smoke was directed through them. They were quite distinct\r\nfrom the “cella vinaria,” or “wine-cellar.” The Opimian wine is\r\nmentioned in c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1398] This writer is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1399] Or amphora.\r\n\r\n[1400] Vessels containing a congius, or the eighth of an amphora,\r\nnearly six pints English.\r\n\r\n[1401] As to this malady, see B. xi. c. 71.\r\n\r\n[1402] B.C. 46.\r\n\r\n[1403] B. xii. c. 61.\r\n\r\n[1404] Or “labrusca.” “Œnanthinum” means “made of vine flowers.” The\r\nwild vine is not a distinct species from the cultivated vine: it is\r\nonly a variety of it, known in botany as the Vitis silvestris labrusca\r\nof Tournefort. Fée thinks that as the must could only be used in\r\nautumn, when the wild vine was not flowering, the flowers of it must\r\nhave been dried.\r\n\r\n[1405] “Solstitiales.” Because they withstand the heat of the solstice.\r\nMarcellus Empiricus calls them “caniculati,” because they bear the heat\r\nof the Dog-star.\r\n\r\n[1406] Fée remarks that this assertion is quite erroneous.\r\n\r\n[1407] From the Greek, meaning “without strength.” The mixture, Fée\r\nremarks, would appear to be neither potable nor wholesome.\r\n\r\n[1408] See B. xviii. c. 24. A kind of beer might be made with it, Fée\r\nsays; but this mixture must have been very unpalatable.\r\n\r\n[1409] See B. xiii. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[1410] A vinous drink may be made in the manner here stated; but\r\nthe palm-wine of the peoples of Asia and Africa is only made of the\r\nfermented sap of the tree. See B. xiii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1411] He says “caryotæ,” and not chydææ, in B. xiii. c. 4. The modius\r\nwas something more than our peck.\r\n\r\n[1412] From the Greek σύκη, a “fig.” This wine was made, Fée thinks,\r\nfrom the produce of some variety of the sycamore. See B. xiii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[1413] “Prime palm” apparently.\r\n\r\n[1414] Tortivum, probably: the second squeezing.\r\n\r\n[1415] See B. xiii. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[1416] See B. xiii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[1417] See B. xiii. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[1418] From ῥόα, a “pomegranate.”\r\n\r\n[1419] Dioscorides calls it “strobilites.” Fée says that they could be\r\nof no service in producing a vinous drink.\r\n\r\n[1420] See B. xv. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[1421] Or “myrtle wine.”\r\n\r\n[1422] Myrtle will not make a wine, but simply a medicament, in which\r\nwine is the menstruum.\r\n\r\n[1423] Artemisia abrotonum of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1424] Ruta graveolens of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1425] Nepeta cataria of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1426] Thymus serpyllum of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1427] Marrubium vulgare of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1428] Grape-juice boiled down to one-third.\r\n\r\n[1429] Brassica napus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1430] Scilla marina of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1431] Nardus Gallicus, or Valeriana Celtica of Linnæus.

A\r\nmedicinal wine is still prepared with wormwood; and “apsinthe,” a\r\nliqueur much esteemed in France, is made from it.\r\n\r\n[1451] Hyssopites.\r\n\r\n[1452] Hyssopites officinalis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1453] Helleborites.\r\n\r\n[1454] Scammonites.\r\n\r\n[1455] Fée says that this is not the fact; and queries whether the\r\nvulgar notion still entertained on this subject, may not be traced up\r\nto our author. It is a not uncommon belief that roses smell all the\r\nsweeter if onions are planted near them.\r\n\r\n[1456] Lavendula stœchas of Linnæus. See B. xxvii. c. 107.\r\n\r\n[1457] Gentiana lutea of Linnæus. See B. xxv. c. 34. Gentian wine is\r\nstill made.\r\n\r\n[1458] Thymus tragoriganum of Linnæus.

See B. xxii. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[1480] There is no ground, Fée says, for this recommendation.\r\n\r\n[1481] Stoves are now used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[1482] “Hydromēlum,” on the other hand, made of water and apples, was\r\nthe same as our modern cider.\r\n\r\n[1483] See B. xxiii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1484] “Subfervefactis.” “Just come on the boil.”\r\n\r\n[1485] The oxymel of modern times contains no salt, and is only used as\r\na medicament.\r\n\r\n[1486] As drinks, no doubt; and with good reason, as to most of them.\r\n\r\n[1487] Coactus.\r\n\r\n[1488] Our medicinal wines will mostly keep longer than this, owing\r\nprobably to the difference in the mode of making the real wines that\r\nform their basis.\r\n\r\n[1489] There is little doubt that this is fabulous: wine taken in\r\nexcess, we know, is productive of loss of the senses, frenzy in the\r\nshape of delirium tremens.\r\n\r\n[1490] This is not unlikely; for, as Fée remarks, the red wines,\r\ncontaining a large proportion of alcohol, act upon the brain and\r\npromote sleep, while the white wines, charged with carbonic gas, are\r\nproductive of wakefulness.\r\n\r\n[1491] Or healing vine. See B. xxiii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[1492] “Libanios.” Probably incense was put in this wine, to produce\r\nthe flavour.\r\n\r\n[1493] From ἀ, “not,” and σπένδειν, “to make libation.”\r\n\r\n[1494] See c. 9 of this Book. It was introduced, probably, from Thasos.\r\n\r\n[1495] From ἐκβάλλω, “to eject.”\r\n\r\n[1496] Apothecis.\r\n\r\n[1497] He alludes to the working of wines in periods of extreme heat;\r\nalso in the spring.\r\n\r\n[1498] Of our modern wines, Madeira and Bourdeaux improve by being\r\ncarried across sea. Burgundy, if any thing, deteriorates, by the\r\ndiminution of its bouquet.\r\n\r\n[1499] After the grapes had been trodden and pressed, the husks were\r\ntaken out and their edges cut, and then again subjected to pressure:\r\nthe result was known as “tortivum,” or “circumcisivum,” a wine of very\r\ninferior quality.\r\n\r\n[1500] He alludes to the young shoots, which have an agreeable acidity,\r\nowing to acetic and tartaric acids.\r\n\r\n[1501] Acetic acid; the result, no doubt, of the faulty mode of\r\nmanufacture universally prevalent; their wines contained evidently but\r\nlittle alcohol.\r\n\r\n[1502] See B. xxiii. c. 24, and B. xxxvi. c. 48.\r\n\r\n[1503] A process very likely, as Fée remarks, to turn the wines\r\nspeedily to vinegar.\r\n\r\n[1504] Down to one-third. This practice of using boiled grape-juice as\r\na seasoning, is still followed in Spain in making some of the liqueurs;\r\nbut it is not generally recommended.\r\n\r\n[1505] B. xvi. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[1506] Asia Minor, namely.\r\n\r\n[1507] B. xiii. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[1508] B. xii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[1509] It produces but a very minute quantity of resin, which is no\r\nlonger an article of commerce.\r\n\r\n[1510] See B. xiii. c. 11, and B. xvi. c. 21. Not the cedar of Lebanon,\r\nprobably, which only gives a very small quantity of resin, but one of\r\nthe junipers.\r\n\r\n[1511] Fée suggests that this may have been the resin of the Arabian\r\nterebinth.\r\n\r\n[1512] See B. xxiv. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[1513] Perhaps from the Pistacia terebinthus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1514] This was made from the terebinth: but the modern resin of\r\nColophon is extracted from varieties of the coniferæ.\r\n\r\n[1515] See B. xxiv. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[1516] Earths are not soluble in oils.\r\n\r\n[1517] As being a mark of extreme effeminacy.\r\n\r\n[1518] The greater the quantity of alcohol, the more resin the wine\r\nwould be able to hold in solution.\r\n\r\n[1519] See B. xvi. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[1520] “Crapula” properly means head-ache, and what is not uncommonly\r\nknown as “seediness.” Resined wine was thought to be productive of\r\nthese effects, and hence obtained the name. This kind of wine was used\r\nitself, as we see above, in seasoning the other kinds. Fée remarks,\r\nthat in reality resins have no such effect as imparting body to weak\r\nwines.\r\n\r\n[1521] The whole of this passage is hopelessly corrupt, and we can only\r\nguess at the meaning.\r\n\r\n[1522] We have already stated that “vappa” is properly vinegar, which\r\nhas been exposed to the air and has lost its flavour. In this fresh\r\nchemical change, which he calls a second fermentation, the wine becomes\r\nvinegar; and probably in the cases he mentions, for some peculiar\r\nreason, its speedy transition to “vappa” could not be arrested.\r\n\r\n[1523] Mixed with water, it was the “posca,” or common drink of the\r\nRoman soldiers; and it was used extensively both by Greeks and Romans\r\nin their cooking, and at meals.\r\n\r\n[1524] In c. 24.\r\n\r\n[1525] By the mixture of ashes, Fée says, the wines would lose their\r\ncolour, and have a detestable alkaline flavour.\r\n\r\n[1526] A perfect absurdity, Fée remarks.\r\n\r\n[1527] B. xvi. cc. 16-23.\r\n\r\n[1528] Bitterness, driness, and a disagreeable smell.\r\n\r\n[1529] Georg. ii. 498.\r\n\r\n[1530] See B. iv. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[1531] See B. xii. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[1532] See B. xxi. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1533] Bees’ wax, Fée remarks, would not have this effect, but vinegar\r\nvessels would.\r\n\r\n[1534] De Re Rust. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[1535] The second “squeezings.”\r\n\r\n[1536] If the wine is turning to vinegar, subacetate of lead will be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n[1537] They are tartrates, and have no affinity at all with nitre.\r\n\r\n[1538] Casks, in fact, similar to those used in France at the present\r\nday. In Spain they use earthen jars and the skins of animals.\r\n\r\n[1539] Oblong earthen vessels, used as vats.\r\n\r\n[1540] “Ventruosa.” He means “round.”\r\n\r\n[1541] As oblong ones, probably.\r\n\r\n[1542] While fermenting, and before racking off.\r\n\r\n[1543] Flos vini, the Mycoderma vini of Desmazieres, a mould or\r\npellicule which forms on the surface, and afterwards falls and is held\r\nin suspension.\r\n\r\n[1544] Vessels of lead are never used for this purpose at the present\r\nday; as that metal would oxidize too rapidly, and liquids would have\r\ngreat difficulty in coming to a boil. A slow fire must have been used\r\nby the ancients.\r\n\r\n[1545] They were thought to give a bad flavour to the sapa or defrutum.\r\n\r\n[1546] A mere puerility, as Fée remarks.\r\n\r\n[1547] He does not state the reason, nor does it appear to be known. At\r\nthe present day warmed wine is sometimes given to a jaded horse, to put\r\nhim on his legs again.\r\n\r\n[1548] Though practised by those who wished to drink largely, this was\r\nconsidered to diminish the flavour of delicate wines.\r\n\r\n[1549] See B. xxii. c. 23, and B. xxv. c. 95; also c. 7 of the present\r\nBook. Wine is no longer considered an antidote to cicuta or hemlock.\r\n\r\n[1550] See B. xxxvi. c. 42.\r\n\r\n[1551] This seems to be the meaning of “lectum;” but the passage is\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\n[1552] Tunicam.\r\n\r\n[1553] He satirizes, probably, some kind of gymnastic exercises that\r\nhad been introduced to promote the speedy passage of the wine through\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n[1554] “In vino veritas.”\r\n\r\n[1555] Fée remarks that this is one proof that the wine of the ancients\r\nwas essentially different in its nature from ours. In our day wine\r\ngives anything but a “pallid” hue.\r\n\r\n[1556] “Rapere vitam.”\r\n\r\n[1557] See B. xxiii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[1558] Three gallons and three pints!! There must have been some\r\njugglery in this performance.\r\n\r\n[1559] Probably towards those guilty of excesses in wine.\r\n\r\n[1560] As Præfectus Urbis.\r\n\r\n[1561] Love of drinking.\r\n\r\n[1562] The mode of testing whether any “heeltaps” were left or not. It\r\nwas this custom, probably, that gave rise to the favourite game of the\r\ncottabus.\r\n\r\n[1563] Dr. Middleton, in his Life of Cicero, in his unlimited\r\npartiality for the family, quotes this as an instance of courage and\r\nhigh spirit.\r\n\r\n[1564] According to Paterculus, he was fond of driving about in a\r\nchariot, crowned with ivy, a golden goblet in his hand, and dressed\r\nlike Bacchus, by which title he ordered himself to be addressed.\r\n\r\n[1565] He alludes to beer, or rather sweet wort, for hops were not\r\nused till the latter part, probably, of the middle ages. Lupines were\r\nsometimes used for flavouring beer.\r\n\r\n[1566] Diodorus Siculus says that the Egyptian beer was nearly equal to\r\nwine in strength and flavour.\r\n\r\n[1567] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1568] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[1569] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[1570] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1571] See end of B. x.\r\n\r\n[1572] See end of B. xi.\r\n\r\n[1573] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1574] Decimus Junius Silanus.

Plant. iv. c.\r\n\r\n[1632] The Olea Europæa of Linnæus. See B. xxi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[1633] This has not been observed to be the fact. It has been known to\r\ngrow in ancient Mesopotamia, more than one hundred leagues from the sea.\r\n\r\n[1634] It is supposed that it is indigenous to Asia, whence it was\r\nintroduced into Africa and the South of Europe. There is little doubt\r\nthat long before the period mentioned by Pliny, it was grown in Africa\r\nby the Carthaginians, and in the South of Gaul, at the colony of\r\nMassilia.\r\n\r\n[1635] This work of Hesiod is no longer in existence; but the assertion\r\nis exaggerated, even if he alludes to the growth of the tree from seed.\r\nFée remarks that a man who has sown the olive at twenty, may gather\r\nexcellent fruit before he arrives at old age. It is more generally\r\npropagated by slips or sets. If the trunk is destroyed by accident, the\r\nroots will throw out fresh suckers.\r\n\r\n[1636] This is the case. We may remark that the tree will grow in this\r\ncountry, but the fruit never comes to maturity.\r\n\r\n[1637] Georg. ii. 85, also ii. 420.\r\n\r\n[1638] Probably the Olea maximo fructu of Tournefort. It has its name\r\nfrom the Greek ὄρχις the “testis,” a name by which it is still known in\r\nsome parts of Provence.\r\n\r\n[1639] Or “shuttle” olive. Probably the modern pickoline, or long olive.\r\n\r\n[1640] Probably the Olea media rotunda præcox of Tournefort. It is\r\nslightly bitter.\r\n\r\n[1641] This is so much the case, that though the olives of Spain and\r\nPortugal are among the finest, their oils are of the very worst quality.\r\n\r\n[1642] It does not appear that the method of preparing oil by the use\r\nof boiling water was known to the ancients. Unripe olives produce an\r\nexcellent oil, but in very small quantities. Hence they are rarely used\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\n[1643] Called “virgin,” or “native” oil in France, and very highly\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\n[1644] Sporta.\r\n\r\n[1645] “Exilibus regulis.” A kind of wooden strainer, apparently\r\ninvented to supersede the wicker, or basket strainer.\r\n\r\n[1646] It is more insipid the riper the fruit, and the less odorous.\r\n\r\n[1647] By absorbing the oxygen of the air. It may be preserved two or\r\nthree years even, in vessels hermetically closed. The oil of France\r\nkeeps better than any other.\r\n\r\n[1648] As well as the grape.\r\n\r\n[1649] In consequence of the faulty mode of manufacture, the oil of\r\nItaly is now inferior to that of France. The oil of Aix is particularly\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\n[1650] In Campania. See B. xvii. c. 3. Horace and Martial speak in\r\npraise of the Venafran olive. Hardouin suggests that Licinius Crassus\r\nmay have introduced the Licinian olive.\r\n\r\n[1651] The heat of Africa is unfavourable to the olive.\r\n\r\n[1652] The fæces, marc, or lees. This is a crude juice contained in the\r\ncellular tissue of the fruit, known as _viridine_ or _chlorophylle_.\r\n\r\n[1653] This is owing, Fée says, to a sort of fermentation, which alters\r\nthe tissue of the cells containing the oil, displaces the constituent\r\nelements, and forms others, such as mucus, sugar, acetic acid,\r\nammoniac, &c. When ripe, the olive contains four oils; that of the\r\nskin, the flesh, the stone, and the kernel.\r\n\r\n[1654] In B. xii. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[1655] See B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[1656] 16th of September.\r\n\r\n[1657] De Causis, B. i. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[1658] This cannot possibly _increase_ the oil, but it would render it\r\nmore fluid, and thereby facilitate its escape from the cells of the\r\nberry.\r\n\r\n[1659] But Cato, Re Rust. c. 144, adds the very significant words,\r\n“injussu domini aut custodis.” “Without the leave of the owner or the\r\nkeeper.”\r\n\r\n[1660] It is found that the olive, after an abundant season, will not\r\nbear in the following year; probably the result of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n[1661] More commonly spelt “pausia.”\r\n\r\n[1662] “Regia.” It is impossible to identify these varieties.\r\n\r\n[1663] 8th of February.\r\n\r\n[1664] This assertion of Pliny is not generally true. The large olives\r\nof Spain yield oil very plentifully.\r\n\r\n[1665] Probably a member of the variety known to naturalists as the\r\nOlea fructu majori, carne crassâ, of Tournefort, the royal olive or\r\n“triparde” of the French. The name is thought to be from the Greek\r\nφαῦλος, the fruit being considered valueless from its paucity of oil.\r\n\r\n[1666] There are but few olive-trees in either Egypt or Decapolis at\r\nthe present day, and no attempts are made to extract oil from them.\r\n\r\n[1667] “Carnis.” He gives this name to the solid part, or pericarp.\r\n\r\n[1668] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1669] These methods are not now adopted for preserving the olive. The\r\nfruit are first washed in an alkaline solution, and then placed in salt\r\nand water. The colymbas was so called from κολυμβάω, “to swim,” in its\r\nown oil, namely. Dioscorides descants on the medicinal properties of\r\nthe colymbades. B. i. c. 140.\r\n\r\n[1670] There are several varieties known of this colour, and more\r\nparticularly the fruit of the Olea atro-rubens of Gouan.\r\n\r\n[1671] The Spanish olive, Hardouin says. Fée thinks that the name\r\n“superba,” “haughty,” is given figuratively, as meaning rough and\r\naustere.\r\n\r\n[1672] The olives of the present Merida, in Spain, are of a rough,\r\ndisagreeable flavour.\r\n\r\n[1673] This seems to be the meaning of “pinguis;” but, as Fée observes,\r\nsalt would have no such effect as here stated, but would impart a\r\ndisagreeable flavour to the oil.\r\n\r\n[1674] Fée regards this assertion as quite fabulous.\r\n\r\n[1675] It will be stated in B. xxviii. c. 13, to what purposes this\r\nabominable collection of filth was applied.\r\n\r\n[1676] 15th of July. He alludes to the inspection of the Equites, which\r\noriginally belonged to the Censors, but afterwards to the Emperors.\r\nOn this occasion there was “recognitio,” or “review,” and then a\r\n“transvectio,” or “procession” of the horsemen.\r\n\r\n[1677] The ovation was a lesser triumph, at which the general entered\r\nthe city not in a chariot, but on foot. In later times, however, the\r\nvictor entered on horseback: and a wreath of myrtle, sometimes laurel,\r\nwas worn by him. For further particulars as to the ovation, see c. 38\r\nof the present Book.\r\n\r\n[1678] Or “oleaster.”\r\n\r\n[1679] De Re Rust. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[1680] A middling or even poor soil is chosen for the olive at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n[1681] Apparently meaning the “white wax” olive.\r\n\r\n[1682] In warm countries, a site exposed to the north is chosen: in\r\ncolder ones, a site which faces the south.\r\n\r\n[1683] See B. xvii. c. 37. This moss has not been identified with\r\nprecision; but the leaf of the olive is often attacked by an\r\n_erysiphus_, known to naturalists as the Alphitomorpha communis; but it\r\nis white, not of a red colour.\r\n\r\n[1684] Fée queries how any one could possibly eat olives that had been\r\nsteeped in a solution of mastich. They must have been nauseous in the\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\n[1685] De Re Rust. c. 64.\r\n\r\n[1686] “Fracibus.” The opinion of Pliny, that olives deteriorate by\r\nbeing left in the store-room, is considered to be well founded; the\r\nolives being apt to ferment, to the deterioration of the oil: at the\r\nsame time, he is wrong in supposing that the amount of oil diminishes\r\nby keeping the berries.\r\n\r\n[1687] “Cortinas.” If we may judge from the name, these vessels were\r\nthree-footed, like a tripod.\r\n\r\n[1688] There are no good grounds for this recommendation, which is\r\nbased on the erroneous supposition that heat increases the oil in the\r\nberry. The free circulation of the air also ought not to be restricted,\r\nas nothing is gained by it. In general, the method of extracting the\r\noil is the same with the moderns as with the ancients, though these\r\nlast did not employ the aid of boiling water.\r\n\r\n[1689] Labra.\r\n\r\n[1690] A “making,” or “batch.”\r\n\r\n[1691] Or “flower.”\r\n\r\n[1692] It may be remarked, that in this Chapter Pliny totally confounds\r\nfixed oils, volatile oils, and medicinal oils. Those in the list which\r\nhe here gives, and which are not otherwise noticed in the Notes, may be\r\nconsidered to belong to this last class.\r\n\r\n[1693] The oleaster furnishes but little oil, and it is seldom\r\nextracted. The oil is thinner than ordinary olive oil, and has a\r\nstronger odour.\r\n\r\n[1694] The Daphne Cneorum and Daphne Cnidium of botanists. See B. xiii.\r\nc. 35, also B. xxiv. c. 82. Fée doubts if an oil was ever made from the\r\nchamelæa.\r\n\r\n[1695] See B. xxiii. c. 41: the Ricinus communis of Linnæus, which\r\nabounds in Egypt at the present day. Though it appears to have been\r\nformerly sometimes used for the table, at the present day the oil is\r\nonly known as “castor” oil, a strong purgative. It is one of the fixed\r\noils. The Jews and Abyssinian Christians say that it was under this\r\ntree that Jonah sat.\r\n\r\n[1696] A “tick.”\r\n\r\n[1697] This method, Fée says, is still pursued in America.\r\n\r\n[1698] See B. xiii. c. 2. One of the fixed oils.\r\n\r\n[1699] An essential oil may be extracted from either; it is of acrid\r\ntaste, green, and aromatic; but does not seem to have been known to the\r\nancients. The berries give by decoction a fixed oil, of green colour,\r\nsweet, and odoriferous. The oils in general here spoken of by Pliny as\r\nextracted from the laurel, are medicinal oils.\r\n\r\n[1700] The Laurus latifolia of Bauhin.\r\n\r\n[1701] The Myrtus latifolia Romana of Bauhin. It yields an essential\r\noil, and by its decoction might give a fixed oil, in small quantity,\r\nbut very odoriferous. As boiled with olive oil, he treats it as a\r\nvolatile oil.\r\n\r\n[1702] See B. xxv. c. 100. This myrtle is the Ruscus aculeatus of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\n[1703] See B. xiii. c. 29, and B xxiii. c. 45. A volatile oil might\r\nbe extracted from the citrus, if one of the thuyæ, as also from the\r\ncypress.\r\n\r\n[1704] See B. xxiii. c. 45. It is a fixed oil, still considerably used\r\nin some parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n[1705] From the Greek καρύα, a “walnut.”\r\n\r\n[1706] “Pitch oil.” See B. xxiv. c. 11. This would be a volatile oil.\r\n\r\n[1707] See B. xxiii. c. 45, also B. xiii. c. 35. Fée is of opinion,\r\nthat as no fixed oil can be extracted from the Daphne Cnidium or Daphne\r\nCneorum, Pliny must allude to a medicinal composition, like the oil of\r\nwild myrtle, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1708] A fixed oil. See B. xii. c. 36. The seeds were used for making\r\nit. See B. xxiii. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[1709] See B. xii. c. 51, and B. xxiii. c. 45. The leaves of the\r\nLawsonia are very odoriferous.\r\n\r\n[1710] The myrobalanus, or ben. See B. xii. c. 46, and B. xxiii. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[1711] Neither the chesnut nor rice produce any kind of fixed oil.\r\n\r\n[1712] See B. xvii. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[1713] Or Fish-eaters. See B. xxxii. c. 38. This is one of the fixed\r\noils.\r\n\r\n[1714] In reality, no fixed oil can be obtained from them.\r\n\r\n[1715] Or wild vine. See B. xii. c. 61, and B. xiii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[1716] Not an oil, so much as a medicinal preparation. Dioscorides\r\nmentions as component parts of it, omphacium, sweet rush, Celtic nard,\r\naspalathus, costus, and must. It received its name from γλεῦκος “must.”\r\n\r\n[1717] The Convolvulus scoparius of Linnæus. See B. xii. c 52, and B.\r\nxiii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[1718] See B. xii. c. 48.\r\n\r\n[1719] See B. xii. c. 54, and B. xiii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[1720] See B. xii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[1721] See B. xii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[1722] See B. xiii. c. 2, p. 163.\r\n\r\n[1723] See B. xii. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[1724] See B. xiii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[1725] Fée doubts the possibility of such a resemblance.\r\n\r\n[1726] Hyoscyamus. A medicinal oil is still extracted from it. See B.\r\nxxiii. c. 49.\r\n\r\n[1727] This medicinal oil is no longer used. The Lupinus albus was\r\nformerly held in greater esteem than it is now.\r\n\r\n[1728] The Raphanus sativus of Linnæus. See B. xix. c. 26. This is one\r\nof the fixed oils; varieties of it are rape oil, and colza oil, now so\r\nextensively used.\r\n\r\n[1729] From the Greek χόρτος, “grass.” This medicinal oil would be\r\ntotally without power or effect.\r\n\r\n[1730] A fixed oil is still extracted in Egypt from the grain known as\r\nsesamum.\r\n\r\n[1731] See B. xxii. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[1732] From κνίδη, a “nettle.” The nettle, or Urtica urens of Linnæus,\r\nhas no oleaginous principles in its seed.\r\n\r\n[1733] Lily oil is still used as a medicinal composition: it is made\r\nfrom the petals of the white lily, Lilium candidum of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1734] From Selga, a town of Pisidia. See B. xxiii. c. 49.\r\n\r\n[1735] See B. iii. c. 9, and B. xxiii. c. 49.\r\n\r\n[1736] A volatile oil, mixed with a small proportion of empyreumatic\r\noil and carbon.\r\n\r\n[1737] “Oil-honey.” Probably a terebinthine, or oleo-resin. See B.\r\nxxiii. c. 50.\r\n\r\n[1738] When rancid and oxygenized by age, it has an irritating quality,\r\nand may be found useful for herpetic diseases.\r\n\r\n[1739] It very probably will have this effect; but at the expense of\r\nthe colour of the ivory, which very soon will turn yellow.\r\n\r\n[1740] It has quite lost its ancient repute: the only use it is now put\r\nto is the manufacture of an inferior soap. See B. xxiii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[1741] De Re Rust. cc. 130, 169.\r\n\r\n[1742] Dolia and cadi. Fée observes, that this, if done with the modern\r\nvessels, would have a tendency to make the oil turn rancid.\r\n\r\n[1743] On the contrary, Fée is inclined to think it would attract them,\r\nfrom its mucilaginous properties.\r\n\r\n[1744] Olive oil, however, has a tendency to generate verdigrease in\r\ncopper vessels.\r\n\r\n[1745] This, as Fée remarks, is probably so absurd as not to be worth\r\ndiscussing.\r\n\r\n[1746] Re Rust. B. i. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[1747] If she happens to have destroyed the buds, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n[1748] The Pinus cembro, probably, of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1749] See B. xvi. c. 23. The nuts of the pine are sweet, and have an\r\nagreeable flavour.\r\n\r\n[1750] Probably the wild pine, the Pinus silvestris of the moderns. The\r\nnuts are slightly resinous.\r\n\r\n[1751] Neither the people of Turin nor of any other place are known at\r\nthe present day to make this preparation.\r\n\r\n[1752] The quince, the Pirus Cydonia of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1753] From Cydonia, a city of Crete. The Latin name is only a\r\ncorruption of the Greek one: in England they were formerly called\r\n“melicotones.”\r\n\r\n[1754] Or “golden apple.” The quince was sacred to Venus, and was an\r\nemblem of love.\r\n\r\n[1755] Apparently meaning the “sparrow quince.” Dioscorides, Galen,\r\nand Athenæus, however, say that it was a large variety. Qy. if in such\r\ncase, it might not mean the ostrich quince?\r\n\r\n[1756] “Early ripener.”\r\n\r\n[1757] Quinces are not grafted on quinces at the present day, but the\r\npear is.\r\n\r\n[1758] Fée suggests that this is a kind of pear.\r\n\r\n[1759] Probably on account of the fragrance of their scent.\r\n\r\n[1760] We learn from other sources that the bed-chambers were\r\nfrequently ornamented with statues of the divinities.\r\n\r\n[1761] The Mala cotonea silvestris of Bauhin; the Cydonia vulgaris of\r\nmodern botanists.\r\n\r\n[1762] “Mala.” The term “malum,” somewhat similar to “pome” with us,\r\nwas applied to a number of different fruits: the orange, the citron,\r\nthe pomegranate, the apricot, and others.\r\n\r\n[1763] Or peach.\r\n\r\n[1764] See B. xiii. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[1765] Or “pound-weight” pears: the Pirus volema of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1766] Or “hard-berry”—probably in reference to the firmness of the\r\nflesh. It is generally thought to be the nectarine.\r\n\r\n[1767] “Præcocia.” It is generally thought that in this name originates\r\nthe word “apricot,” the Prunus Armeniaca of Linnæus. There is, however,\r\nan early peach that ripens by the middle of July, though it is very\r\ndoubtful if it was known to Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1768] “From above.”\r\n\r\n[1769] Perhaps the Prunus ungarica of naturalists, the black damask\r\nplum; or else the Prunus perdrigona, the perdrigon.\r\n\r\n[1770] Probably the Prunus galatensis of naturalists.\r\n\r\n[1771] “Hordearia:” the Prunus præcox of naturalists; probably our\r\nharvest plum.\r\n\r\n[1772] Or “ass”-plum. The Prunus acinaria of naturalists: the cherry\r\nplum of the French.\r\n\r\n[1773] Or “wax plum.” The Prunus cereola of naturalists: the mirabelle\r\nof the French.\r\n\r\n[1774] Possibly the Prunus enucleata of Lamarck: the myrobalan of the\r\nFrench. Many varieties, however, are purple.\r\n\r\n[1775] There are two opinions on this: that it is the Prunus Claudiana\r\nof Lamarck, the “Reine Claude” of the French; or else that it is\r\nidentical with the apricot already mentioned, remarkable for the\r\nsweetness of its smell.\r\n\r\n[1776] Or nut-prune.\r\n\r\n[1777] The Prunus insititia of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1778] The result of this would only be a plum like that of the tree\r\nfrom which the graft was cut.\r\n\r\n[1779] The same as with reference to the graft on the apple.\r\n\r\n[1780] This is probably quite fabulous.\r\n\r\n[1781] B. xiii. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[1782] The Prunus Damascena of the naturalists; our common damson, with\r\nits numerous varieties.\r\n\r\n[1783] Probably the Cordia myxa of Linnæus; the Sebestier of the\r\nFrench. It has a viscous pulp, and is much used as a pectoral. It grows\r\nonly in Syria and Egypt; and hence Fée is inclined to reject what Pliny\r\nsays as to its naturalization at Rome, and the account he gives as to\r\nits being engrafted on the sorb.\r\n\r\n[1784] _I. e._ Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[1785] Hospitium.\r\n\r\n[1786] See B. xiii. c. 17. The Balanites Ægyptiaca of Delille.\r\n\r\n[1787] It was this probably, and not the peach-tree, that would not\r\nbear fruit in the isle of Rhodes.\r\n\r\n[1788] Perseus.\r\n\r\n[1789] Fée remarks that the wild plum, the Prunus silvestris or\r\ninsititia of Linnæus, was to be found in Italy before the days of Cato.\r\n\r\n[1790] See B. xii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[1791] Of Media.\r\n\r\n[1792] Its fruit will ripen in France, as far north as Tours. It is\r\nthe Zizyphus vulgaris of Lamarck. It resembles a small plum, and is\r\nsometimes used as a sweetmeat. The confection sold as jujube paste is\r\nnot the dried jelly of this fruit, but merely gum arabic and sugar,\r\ncoloured.\r\n\r\n[1793] A variety of the jujube, Fée is inclined to think. A nut-peach\r\nhas also been suggested.\r\n\r\n[1794] A.U.C. 779.\r\n\r\n[1795] Or perhaps embankment: “agger.”\r\n\r\n[1796] A reddish colour. For the composition of this colour, see B.\r\nxxxv. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[1797] “Lanata;” perhaps rather the “downy” fruit; a variety of quince,\r\nFée thinks. Pliny probably had never seen this fruit, in his opinion,\r\nand only speaks after Virgil, Ecl. ii. l. 51. “Ipse ego cana legam\r\ntenera lanugine mala.”\r\n\r\n[1798] See B. xii. c. 6. The Matian and the Cestian apple are thought\r\nby Dalechamps to have been the French “court-pendu,” or “short stalk.”\r\n\r\n[1799] The Scandian is thought to have been a winter pear.\r\n\r\n[1800] Adrian Junius takes this to be the “kers-appel” of the Flemish.\r\n\r\n[1801] De Re Rust. cc. 7 and 143.\r\n\r\n[1802] Dolia.\r\n\r\n[1803] Hardouin says that this is the “Pomme d’api” of the French; it\r\nis the “Court-pendu” with Adrian Junius.\r\n\r\n[1804] The “Pomme de Saint Thomas,” according to Adrian Junius:\r\nDalechamps identifies it with the pomme de Granoi. See B. iii. c. 19,\r\nand cc. 17 and 18 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[1805] “Græcula.” So called, perhaps, from Tarentum, situated in Magna\r\nGræcia.\r\n\r\n[1806] Twins. This variety is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1807] Or “red” apple. The red calville of the French, according to\r\nHardouin; the Pomme suzine, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1808] The Girandotte of the French; the appel-heeren of the Dutch.\r\n\r\n[1809] The “early ripener.” Dalechamps identifies it with the pomme\r\nSaint Jean, the apple of St. John.\r\n\r\n[1810] The Pomme rose, or rose apple, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1811] Or “erect teat.” The Pomme taponne of the French, according to\r\nDalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1812] Or eunuch. The Passe pomme, or Pomme grillotte of the French.\r\n\r\n[1813] Or “leaf apple.” Fée remarks that this occasionally happens, but\r\nthe apple does not form a distinct variety.\r\n\r\n[1814] The Pomme pannete, according to Dalechamps: the Pomme gelée of\r\nProvence.\r\n\r\n[1815] Or “lung” apple. The Pomme folane, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1816] The Pirus malus of Linnæus, the wild apple, or estranguillon of\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\n[1817] It is doubtful whether he does not allude here to a peculiar\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n[1818] Or “mealy” apples.\r\n\r\n[1819] Or “proud” pear. The Petite muscadelle, according to Dalechamps.\r\nAdrian Junius says that it is the water-peere of the Dutch.\r\n\r\n[1820] From Crustumium in Italy; the Poire perle, or pearl pear,\r\naccording to Dalechamps: the Jacob’s peere of the Flemish.\r\n\r\n[1821] The Poire sucrée, or “sugar-pear,” according to Hardouin; the\r\nBergamotte, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1822] “Potu.” He would appear to allude to the manufacture of perry.\r\n\r\n[1823] The Syrian pear is commended by Martial; it has not been\r\nidentified, however.\r\n\r\n[1824] The Poire musot, according to Dalechamps. Adrian Junius says\r\nthat it is the Engelsche braet-peere of the Flemish.\r\n\r\n[1825] The Pirus Pompeiana of Linnæus. Dalechamps identifies it with\r\nthe Bon chretien, and Adrian Junius with the Taffel-peere of the\r\nFlemish.\r\n\r\n[1826] The “breast-formed.”\r\n\r\n[1827] The Pirus Favonia of Linnæus: the Grosse poire muscadelle of the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n[1828] The Poire prevost, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1829] The Poire foré, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1830] The Saint Thomas’s pear of the Flemish.\r\n\r\n[1831] The Poire chat of the French, according to Dalechamps; the\r\nRiet-peere of the Flemish.\r\n\r\n[1832] “Like onyx.” The Cuisse-madame, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1833] The Calveau rosat, according to Dalechamps. Perhaps the Poire\r\nd’ambre, or amber pear, of the French.\r\n\r\n[1834] The Poire d’argent, or silver pear, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1835] Or “barley pear.” The Poire de Saint Jean, according to\r\nDalechamps; the musquette or muscadella, according to Adrian Junius.\r\n\r\n[1836] Barley-harvest.\r\n\r\n[1837] So called from its resemblance to the “ampulla,” a big-bellied\r\nvessel with a small neck, identified with the Poire d’angoisse by\r\nDalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1838] The Poire de jalousie, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1839] Or gourd-pear. This is the “isbout” according to Adrian Junius,\r\nthe Poire courge of Dalechamps, and the Poire de sarteau, or de campane\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n[1840] The Poire de Venus, according to Adrian Junius; the Poire\r\nacciole, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1841] Coloured pear.\r\n\r\n[1842] “Regium.” The Poire carmagnole, according to Dalechamps; the\r\nMispeel-peere of the Flemish, according to Adrian Junius.\r\n\r\n[1843] The Poire sarteau, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[1844] Georgics, ii. 87.\r\n\r\n[1845] “A handful”—probably the pound or pounder pear: the Bergamotte,\r\naccording to Hardouin; the Bon chretien of summer, according to Adrian\r\nJunius.\r\n\r\n[1846] De Re Rust. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[1847] Or “Seedling.”\r\n\r\n[1848] The “early ripener.” Fée suggests that this may be a variety of\r\nthe Bon chretien.\r\n\r\n[1849] Georgics, ii. 69. This statement of Virgil must be regarded\r\nas fabulous; grafting being impracticable with trees not of the same\r\nfamily, and not always successful even then.\r\n\r\n[1850] This was probably some superstition taught by the augurs for the\r\npurpose of enveloping their profession in additional mystery and awe.\r\n\r\n[1851] Cadis.\r\n\r\n[1852] He probably alludes here to cider and perry. See p. 300, and B.\r\nxxiii. c. 62.\r\n\r\n[1853] “Pulmentarii vicem;” properly “a substitute for pulmentarium,”\r\nwhich was anything eaten with bread, such as meat, vegetables, &c.\r\nHe alludes to marmalade. The French raisine is a somewhat similar\r\npreparation from pears and quinces boiled in new wine.\r\n\r\n[1854] “Specularibus.” He alludes to windows of transparent stone,\r\nlapis specularis, or mica; windows of glass being probably unknown\r\nin his time. The ordinary windows were merely openings closed with\r\nshutters. See B. xxxvi. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[1855] He must allude to a kind of quince marmalade.\r\n\r\n[1856] As Fée remarks, the fruit, if treated thus, would soon lose all\r\nthe properties for which it is valued.\r\n\r\n[1857] De Re Rust. B. i. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[1858] A faulty proceeding, however dry it may be.\r\n\r\n[1859] This fruit, Fée remarks, keeps but indifferently, and soon\r\nbecomes soft, vinous, and acid.\r\n\r\n[1860] An absurd superstition.\r\n\r\n[1861] A method not unlikely to spoil the grape, from the difficulty of\r\nremoving the coat thus given to it.\r\n\r\n[1862] A very absurd notion, as Fée observes. To keep fruit in millet\r\nis also condemned.\r\n\r\n[1863] Which, of course, must deteriorate the flavour of the grape.\r\n\r\n[1864] It is doubtful if they will increase in size, when once plucked.\r\n\r\n[1865] The modern authorities recommend the precisely opposite plan.\r\n\r\n[1866] As absurd as the use of the bulb of squill.\r\n\r\n[1867] In a pit two feet deep, &c. See above.\r\n\r\n[1868] Capsæ.\r\n\r\n[1869] See B. xxi. c. 49.\r\n\r\n[1870] De Re Rust. B. xii. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[1871] These must make raisins of the sun.\r\n\r\n[1872] These must have been perfectly dry, or else they would tend to\r\nrot the grapes or raisins.\r\n\r\n[1873] Columella, for instance, B. xii. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[1874] The dust is in reality very liable to spoil the fruit, from the\r\ntenacity with which it adheres. In all these methods, little attention\r\nwould seem to be paid to the retention of the flavour of the fruits.\r\n\r\n[1875] A detestable practice, Fée says, as the oil makes an indelible\r\nmark on the grape, and gives it an abominable flavour. It is the best\r\nmethod to put the fruit in bags of paper or hair.\r\n\r\n[1876] See B. xiii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1877] There are about forty varieties now known.\r\n\r\n[1878] B. xiii. c. 14, 15. These are the Ficus sycomorus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1879] In Troas; called the Alexandrian fig, from the city of\r\nAlexandria there. Fée doubts if this was really a fig, and suggests\r\nthat it might be the fruit of a variety of Diospyros.\r\n\r\n[1880] No fig-tree now known is destitute of this.\r\n\r\n[1881] Fée treats this as an exaggeration.\r\n\r\n[1882] From “mamilla,” a teat.\r\n\r\n[1883] In Egypt. The Figue servantine, or cordeliere.\r\n\r\n[1884] “Delicata.” The “bon-bouche.”\r\n\r\n[1885] Fée suggests that this may have been the small early fig.\r\n\r\n[1886] From Livia, the wife of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[1887] From Pompeius Magnus.\r\n\r\n[1888] Apparently meaning the “marsh” fig.\r\n\r\n[1889] The Laconian reed, Theophrastus says, B. iv. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[1890] The “white-wax” fig.\r\n\r\n[1891] Fée queries whether it may not be the Grosse bourjasotte.\r\n\r\n[1892] Or “people’s” fig. The small early white fig.\r\n\r\n[1893] Or “swallow”-fig.\r\n\r\n[1894] Or it may mean “white and black,” that being the colour of the\r\nfig. Such a variety is still known.\r\n\r\n[1895] A Spanish variety; those of the south of Spain are very highly\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\n[1896] The modern “black” fig.\r\n\r\n[1897] The sun of the former year.\r\n\r\n[1898] In Mœsia—the present Servia and Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n[1899] Another war is said to have originated in this fruit. Xerxes was\r\ntempted by the fine figs of Athens to undertake the invasion of Greece.\r\n\r\n[1900] “Tertium ante diem.” In dating from an event, the Romans\r\nincluded both days in the computation; the one they dated _from_, and\r\nthe day _of_, the event.\r\n\r\n[1901] In sending for the fig, and thinking of this method of speaking\r\nto the feelings of his fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\n[1902] A place in the Forum, where public meetings were held, and\r\ncertain offences tried.\r\n\r\n[1903] He alludes to the Puteal, or enclosed space in the Forum,\r\nconsecrated by Scribonius Libo, in consequence of the spot having been\r\nstruck by lightning.\r\n\r\n[1904] On the banks of the Tiber, below the Palatine Mount. The whole\r\nof this passage is in a most corrupt state, and it is difficult to\r\nextract a meaning from it.\r\n\r\n[1905] By slips from the old tree, as Tacitus seems to say—“in novos\r\nfœtus revivisceret.”\r\n\r\n[1906] At the foot of the Capitoline Hill.\r\n\r\n[1907] Probably near where the Curtius Lacus had stood in the early\r\ndays of Rome. The story of Metius Curtius, who leaped into the yawning\r\ngulph in the Forum, in order to save his country, is known to every\r\nclassical reader.\r\n\r\n[1908] The Forum.\r\n\r\n[1909] See B. xix. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[1910] The Ficus Carica of Linnæus. It _does_ bear fruit, though small,\r\nand disagreeable to the taste.\r\n\r\n[1911] This insect is one of the Hymenoptera; the Cynips Psenes of\r\nLinnæus and Fabricius. There is another insect of the same genus, but\r\nnot so well known.\r\n\r\n[1912] Fée observes that the caprification accelerates the ripeness of\r\nthe fruit, but at the expense of the flavour. For the same purpose the\r\nupper part of the fig is often pricked with a pointed quill.\r\n\r\n[1913] “Infantiam pomi”—literally, “the infancy of the fruit.”\r\n\r\n[1914] Fée denies the truth of this assertion.\r\n\r\n[1915] Frumenta.\r\n\r\n[1916] A mixture of the sugar of the fruit with the milky juice of the\r\ntree, which is a species of caoutchouc.\r\n\r\n[1917] Capsis.\r\n\r\n[1918] See B. iii. c. 11. The Balearic Isles still produce great\r\nquantities of excellent dried figs.\r\n\r\n[1919] See B. iii. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[1920] Orcæ.\r\n\r\n[1921] Cadi.\r\n\r\n[1922] Ground, perhaps, into a kind of flour.\r\n\r\n[1923] Opsonii vicem. “Opsonium” was anything eaten with bread, such as\r\nvegetables, meat, and fish, for instance.\r\n\r\n[1924] De Re Rust. c. 56.\r\n\r\n[1925] Because they would be sure, under any circumstances, to eat\r\nplenty of them.\r\n\r\n[1926] See B. xiii. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[1927] These were so called from Caunus, a city of Caria, famous\r\nfor its dried figs. Pronounced “Cavneas,” it would sound to the\r\nsuperstitious, “Cave ne eas,” “Take care that you go not.”\r\n\r\n[1928] At Brundisium.\r\n\r\n[1929] A.U.C. 801.\r\n\r\n[1930] Alba Longa. See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1931] The sorb belongs to the genus pirus of the naturalists.\r\n\r\n[1932] The Mespilus germanica of the botanists.\r\n\r\n[1933] The azarolier, a tree of the south of Europe, the Mespilus apii\r\nfolio laciniato of C. Bauhin.\r\n\r\n[1934] The Mespilus Italica folio laurino serrato of C. Bauhin, the\r\nMespilus cotoneaster of J. Bauhin.\r\n\r\n[1935] Its identity is matter of uncertainty; but it has been thought\r\nto be the Cratægus oxyacantha of modern botanists.\r\n\r\n[1936] By “amplissimus,” he must mean that it spreads out very much in\r\nproportion to its height, as it is merely a shrub.\r\n\r\n[1937] Fée thinks it a tree indigenous to the north.\r\n\r\n[1938] The ordinary sorb-apple of horticulturists.\r\n\r\n[1939] The sorb-pear.\r\n\r\n[1940] Varying but little, probably, from the common sorb, the Sorbus\r\ndomestica of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1941] Fée is inclined to think that it is the Sorbus terminalis of\r\nLamarck. Anguillara thinks that it is the Cratægus of Theophrastus,\r\nconsidered by Sprengel to be identical with the Cratægus azarolus of\r\nLinnæus. In ripening, the fruit of the sorb undergoes a sort of vinous\r\nfermentation: hence a kind of cider made of it.\r\n\r\n[1942] De Re Rust. cc. 7 and 145.\r\n\r\n[1943] The Juglans regia of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1944] Tastes have probably altered since this was written.\r\n\r\n[1945] These were rude and sometimes obscene songs sung at festivals,\r\nand more particularly marriages. While these songs were being sung at\r\nthe door of the nuptial chamber, it was the custom for the husband to\r\nscramble walnuts among the young people assembled there. The walnut is\r\nthe nut mentioned in Solomon’s Song, vi. 11.\r\n\r\n[1946] Or, more probably, from the union of the two portions of the\r\ninner shell.\r\n\r\n[1947] “Tripudium sonivium;” implying that it was considered sacred to\r\nmarriage, from the use made of it by the friends of the bridegroom when\r\nthrown violently against the nuptial chamber, with the view of drowning\r\nthe cries of the bride. A very absurd notion, to all appearance.\r\n\r\n[1948] The “Persian” nut.\r\n\r\n[1949] The “king’s” nut. The walnut-tree still abounds in Persia, and\r\nis found wild on the slopes of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n[1950] Implying that it comes from the Greek κάρη, “the head.” Some\r\netymologists think that it is from the Celto-Scythian _carw_, a boat;\r\nsuch being the shape of the two parts of the inner shell.\r\n\r\n[1951] It is still a common notion, Fée says, that it is highly\r\ninjurious to sleep beneath a walnut-tree.\r\n\r\n[1952] It is still used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[1953] Red hair was admired by the Romans. The Roman females used this\r\njuice also for dyeing their hair when grey.\r\n\r\n[1954] They are not _entirely_ separate.\r\n\r\n[1955] The Corylus avellana maxima of Willdenow.\r\n\r\n[1956] The filbert, the Corylus tubulosa of Willdenow.\r\n\r\n[1957] Abellinum, in Campania. See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1958] The down on the nut is more apparent when it is young; but it is\r\neasily rubbed off. The outer coat is probably meant.\r\n\r\n[1959] Hazel nuts are sometimes roasted in some parts of Europe, but\r\nnot with us.\r\n\r\n[1960] The Amygdalus communis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1961] De Re Rust. c. 8. Some think that this was the bitter almond;\r\nand the word “acriore,” used by Pliny, would almost seem to imply that\r\nsuch is the case.\r\n\r\n[1962] Apparently the “smooth” or “bald” nut. May not a variety\r\nsomething like the hickory nut of America be meant?\r\n\r\n[1963] Festus says that a kind of nut was so called, because the\r\nPrænestines, when besieged by Hannibal at Casilinum, subsisted upon\r\nthem. See Livy, B. xxiii. Fée considers it only another name for the\r\ncommon hazel nut.\r\n\r\n[1964] De Re Rust. c. 145.\r\n\r\n[1965] The soft-shelled almond, or princess almond of the French; the\r\nAmygdalus communis fragilis of naturalists.\r\n\r\n[1966] This last variety does not seem to have been identified: the\r\nhard-shell almonds do not appear to be larger than the others.\r\n\r\n[1967] Or “soft” almond, a variety only of the Amygdalus fragilis.\r\n\r\n[1968] There is little doubt that Fée is right in his assertion, that\r\nthis great personage imposed on our author; as no trees of this family\r\nare known to bear two crops.\r\n\r\n[1969] B. xiii. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[1970] In c. xxi. of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1971] The tree is the Fagus castanea of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[1972] Cortex.\r\n\r\n[1973] The common mode of eating it at the present day. The Italians\r\nalso take off the skin and dry the nut; thus keeping it from year to\r\nyear. When required for eating, it is softened by the steam of boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[1974] Not improbably said in allusion to the fasts introduced by the\r\nJews, who had become very numerous in Rome.\r\n\r\n[1975] It was said to have come from Castana, a city of Pontus, whence\r\nits name “Castanea.” It is probably indigenous to Europe.\r\n\r\n[1976] The Greek for “Jove’s acorn.”\r\n\r\n[1977] Or “acorn chesnut.” The same variety, Fée says, that is found\r\nin the vicinity of Perigueux, small, nearly round, and without any\r\nparticular flavour.\r\n\r\n[1978] The Ganebelone chesnut of Perigueux, Fée says, answers to this\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n[1979] On account of the prickles on the outer shell.\r\n\r\n[1980] B. xvii. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[1981] Fée says that the royal white chesnut of the vicinity of\r\nPerigueux answers to this.\r\n\r\n[1982] “Boiling” chesnuts.\r\n\r\n[1983] He alludes to wild or horse chesnuts, probably.\r\n\r\n[1984] See B. xiii. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[1985] This skin is not eatable. It is fibrous and astringent.\r\n\r\n[1986] In B. xvi. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[1987] “Acinis.” The grape, ivy-berry, elder-berry, and others.\r\n\r\n[1988] “Inter cutem succumque.”\r\n\r\n[1989] Baccis. Some confusion is created by the non-existence of\r\nEnglish words to denote the difference between “acinus” and “bacca.”\r\nThe latter is properly the “berry;” the grape being the type of the\r\n“acinus.”\r\n\r\n[1990] See B. xvi. c. 41. The mulberry is the Morus nigra of modern\r\nnaturalists. It is generally thought that this was the only variety\r\nknown to the ancients; but Fée queries, from the story of Pyramus and\r\nThisbe, which represents the mulberry as changing from white to blood\r\ncolour, that the white mulberry was not unknown to them; but through\r\nsome cause, now unknown, was gradually lost sight of.\r\n\r\n[1991] This is still the case with the mulberry.\r\n\r\n[1992] See B. xvi. c. 71, and B. xxiv. c. 73. He alludes to the\r\nblackberry.\r\n\r\n[1993] The common strawberry, the Fragaria vesca of Linnæus. See B.\r\nxxi. c. 50. A native of the Alps and the forests of Gaul, it was\r\nunknown to the Greeks.\r\n\r\n[1994] The Arbutus unedo of Linnæus. It is one of the ericaceous\r\ntrees, and its fruit bears a considerable resemblance to the\r\nstrawberry—otherwise there is not the slightest affinity between\r\nthem. The taste of the arbute is poor indeed, compared to that of the\r\nstrawberry.\r\n\r\n[1995] He suggests that it is so called from “unum edo,” “I eat but\r\none;” a rather fanciful etymology, it would seem.\r\n\r\n[1996] This supposition is not warranted, from merely the fact of there\r\nbeing two names.\r\n\r\n[1997] See B. xvi. c. 52.\r\n\r\n[1998] See B. xxiv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[1999] See B. xiii. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[2000] “Baccis.” Berries, properly so called.\r\n\r\n[2001] The Celtis Australis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2002] Supposed by some to be the holly. See B. xxv. c. 72.\r\n\r\n[2003] He alludes to a variety of the cratægus.\r\n\r\n[2004] The Cerasus vulgaris of modern botanists. It is said to have\r\nobtained its name from Cerasus, in Asia Minor, where Lucullus found it.\r\n\r\n[2005] He must allude to what he has stated in B. xii. c. 3, for he has\r\nnowhere said that the cherry will not grow in Egypt. It is said that\r\nthe cherry is not to be found in Egypt at the present day.\r\n\r\n[2006] The griotte cherry of the French, the mazzard of the English.\r\n\r\n[2007] A variety of the mazzard, Fée thinks.\r\n\r\n[2008] Some take this for the Cerasus Juliana, the guignier of the\r\nFrench, our white heart; others, again, for the merisier, our morello.\r\n\r\n[2009] It is most generally thought that this is the Cerasus avium of\r\nbotanists, our morello, which is a very tender cherry.\r\n\r\n[2010] Or “hard berry,” the Prunus bigarella of Linnæus, the red\r\nbigaroon.\r\n\r\n[2011] Fée queries whether it may not have received its name of\r\n“Pliniana” in compliment to our author, or one of his family.\r\n\r\n[2012] Hardouin thinks that this Portuguese cherry is the griotte, or\r\nmazzard.\r\n\r\n[2013] No such cherry is known at the present day.\r\n\r\n[2014] Such a graft is impossible; the laurel-cherry must have had some\r\nother origin.\r\n\r\n[2015] Fée suggests that this may be the early dwarf cherry.\r\n\r\n[2016] Or “ground-cherry;” a dwarf variety, if, indeed, it was a\r\ncherry-tree at all, of which Fée expresses some doubt.\r\n\r\n[2017] This explains, Fée says, why it will not grow in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[2018] The Cornus mas of Linnæus. The fruit of the cornel has a tart\r\nflavour, but is not eaten in modern Europe, except by school-boys.\r\n\r\n[2019] That produces mastich. See B. xii. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[2020] He alludes more especially, perhaps, to the use of cicuta or\r\nhemlock by drunkards, who looked upon it as an antidote to the effects\r\nof wine. See B. xiv. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2021] Fée remarks, that in this enumeration there is no method.\r\nLinnæus enumerates eleven principal flavours in the vegetable\r\nkingdom—dry or insipid, aqueous, viscous, salt, acrid, styptic, sweet,\r\nfat, bitter, acid, and nauseous; these terms, however seem, some of\r\nthem, to be very indefinite.\r\n\r\n[2022] It requires considerable discernment to appropriate nicely its\r\nEnglish synonym to these four varieties of tastes, “acer, acutus,\r\nacerbus, and acidus,” more especially when we find that the “bitter”\r\nand the “rough” are occupied already by the “amarus” and the “austerus.”\r\n\r\n[2023] In allusion, probably, to the pungency of the aroma or bouquet.\r\n\r\n[2024] Lenitate.\r\n\r\n[2025] This seems to be the meaning of “succus.”\r\n\r\n[2026] The “insipid.”\r\n\r\n[2027] This is so much the case, that the most nauseous medicine may\r\nbe taken almost with impunity—so far as taste is concerned—by tightly\r\npressing the nostrils while taking it.\r\n\r\n[2028] Fée remarks that this is true of fire, and of distilled or\r\nperfectly pure water; but that physiologists are universally agreed\r\nthat the air has its own peculiar smell.\r\n\r\n[2029] All fruits that are rich in sugar and amidine, Fée says, either\r\nhave, or acquire in time, a vinous flavour, by the development of a\r\ncertain quantity of alcohol.\r\n\r\n[2030] In the fruit with a fixed oil, this principle succeeds, when\r\nthey are ripe, to the mucilaginous.\r\n\r\n[2031] He must mean a thinner juice, though still sweet.\r\n\r\n[2032] About the peduncle or stalk of the fig. The juice here, Fée\r\nsays, is a real sugar, of the same nature as that which circulates\r\nthroughout the whole fruit: the juice in the interior of which is\r\nproduced by another order of vessels.\r\n\r\n[2033] The juice is only foamy when the vinous fermentation is\r\nestablished. It has that appearance, however, when the fruit is bitten\r\nwith the teeth.\r\n\r\n[2034] The “hard-berry,” or nectarine.\r\n\r\n[2035] In the sense of aromatic, or penetrating.\r\n\r\n[2036] He probably means those of a luscious or sirupy nature, without\r\nany acidity whatever.\r\n\r\n[2037] He seems to mean that the thick, luscious wines require longer\r\nkeeping, before they will gain any aroma at all. This would be done,\r\nprobably, at the expense of their sweetness.\r\n\r\n[2038] Or he may mean, that a fine flavour and a fine smell cannot\r\nco-exist.\r\n\r\n[2039] The reading here should be “acutissimus,” probably, instead of\r\n“acerrimus.” The odour exists in the rind of the citron and in the\r\nouter coat of the quince; if these are removed, the fruit becomes\r\ninodorous.\r\n\r\n[2040] “Tenuis.” He may possibly mean “faint.”\r\n\r\n[2041] The fruit of the ben, or myrobalanus, the Balanites Ægyptiaca.\r\nSee B. xiii. cc. 17 and 19.\r\n\r\n[2042] Vitium.\r\n\r\n[2043] Hard-berry or nectarine. See c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2044] Lignum: literally, “wood.” “There is no wood, either within\r\nor without.” He has one universal name for what we call shell, seed,\r\nstones, pips, grains, &c.\r\n\r\n[2045] The “spado,” or “eunuch” date. See B. xiii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2046] See B. xiii. c. 17. The fruit of the ben is alluded to, but, as\r\nFée observes, Pliny is wrong in calling it an almond, as it is a pulpy\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n[2047] The Nymphæa nelumbo of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2048] Or shell, which, as Fée remarks, participates but very little in\r\nthe properties of the flesh.\r\n\r\n[2049] Or “honey” apple; see c. 15 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2050] Or “Carian” fig. See c. 19 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2051] See B. xiii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2052] See B. xiii. c. 42, and B. xx. cc. 9 and 23.\r\n\r\n[2053] See B. xiii. c. 26, and B. xxiv. c. 66.\r\n\r\n[2054] See B. xiii. c. 22. Fée remarks that it is singular how the\r\nancients could eat the branches of the fig-tree, the juice being\r\nactually a poison.\r\n\r\n[2055] See B. xiii. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[2056] See c. 26 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2057] He is wrong: the same is the case with the berries of the\r\nlaurel, and, indeed, many other kinds of berries.\r\n\r\n[2058] See c. 7 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2059] See B. xiv. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2060] See B. xii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[2061] A kind of sausage, seasoned with myrtle. See also B. xxvii c. 49.\r\n\r\n[2062] He means the Acroceraunian chain in Epirus, mentioned in B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2063] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2064] He was one of the companions of Ulysses, fabled by Homer and\r\nOvid to have been transformed by Circe into a swine.\r\n\r\n[2065] Μυρσίνη was its Greek name.\r\n\r\n[2066] See B. xxv. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[2067] See B. xii. c. 2. Ovid, Fasti, B. iv. l. 15, _et seq._, says\r\nthat Venus concealed herself from the gaze of the Satyrs behind this\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n[2068] Either this story is untrue, or we have a right to suspect that\r\nsome underhand agency was employed for the purpose of imposing on the\r\nsuperstitious credulity of the Roman people.\r\n\r\n[2069] Or Social War. See B. ii c. 85.\r\n\r\n[2070] Near the altar of Consus, close to the meta of the Circus.\r\n\r\n[2071] De Re Rust. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2072] The so-called wild myrtle does not in reality belong to the\r\ngenus Myrtus.\r\n\r\n[2073] See B. xxiii. c. 83; the Ruscus aculeatus of the family of the\r\nAsparagea.\r\n\r\n[2074] The common myrtle, Myrtus communis of the naturalists.\r\n\r\n[2075] Or Roman myrtle, a variety of the Myrtus communis.\r\n\r\n[2076] The “six row” myrtle. Fée thinks that it belongs to the Myrtus\r\nangustifolia Bœtica of Bauhin.\r\n\r\n[2077] De Re Rust. 125.\r\n\r\n[2078] See B. xxiii. c. 81.\r\n\r\n[2079] A new proof, as Fée remarks, that the ancients had peculiar\r\nnotions of their own, as to the flavour of wine; myrtle berries, he\r\nsays, would impart to wine a detestable aromatic flavour.\r\n\r\n[2080] “Saccis:” the strainer being made of cloth. See B. xiv. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[2081] They would be of no assistance whatever, and this statement is\r\nentirely fictitious.\r\n\r\n[2082] He may possibly mean hernia.\r\n\r\n[2083] In addition to all those particulars, he might have stated that\r\nthe Lares, or household gods, were crowned with myrtle, and that it was\r\nnot allowed to enter the Temple of Bona Dea.\r\n\r\n[2084] A.U.C. 251.\r\n\r\n[2085] See the Notes to c. 35 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2086] Because the enemy would be less likely to envy us a bloodless\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n[2087] He disdained the more humble myrtle crown, and intrigued\r\nsuccessfully with the Senate to allow him to wear a wreath of laurel.\r\n\r\n[2088] The Senate refused him a triumph; and he accordingly celebrated\r\none on the Alban Mount, B.C. 231. Paulus Diaconus says that his reason\r\nfor wearing a myrtle crown was his victory over the Corsicans on the\r\nMyrtle Plains, though where they were, or what victory is alluded to,\r\nis not known.\r\n\r\n[2089] The brother of Valerius Publicola.\r\n\r\n[2090] We learn from two passages in Ovid that the laurel was suspended\r\nover the gates of the emperors. This, as Fée remarks, was done for two\r\nreasons: because it was looked upon as a protection against lightning,\r\nand because it was considered an emblem of immortality.\r\n\r\n[2091] De Re Rust. 133.\r\n\r\n[2092] Or “laurel of Apollo:” it was into this tree that Daphne was\r\nfabled to have been changed. See Ovid’s Met. B. i. l. 557, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2093] Cato, De Re Rust. c. 121, tells us that this cake was made of\r\nfine wheat, must, anise, cummin, suet, cheese, and scraped laurel\r\nsprigs. Laurel leaves were placed under it when baked. This mixture was\r\nconsidered a light food, good for the stomach!\r\n\r\n[2094] At the Pythian Games celebrated there.\r\n\r\n[2095] Meaning that it curves at the edge, something like a pent-house.\r\n\r\n[2096] Or tine tree, the Viburnum tinus of Linnæus, one of the\r\ncaprifolia. It is not reckoned as one of the laurels, though it has\r\nmany of the same characteristics.\r\n\r\n[2097] Regia.\r\n\r\n[2098] The barren laurel of the triumphs was the Laurus nobilis of\r\nLinnæus, which has only male flowers.\r\n\r\n[2099] The Laurus vulgaris folio undulato of the Parisian _Hortus_, Fée\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n[2100] Not a laurel, nor yet a dicotyledon, Fée says, but one of the\r\nAsparagea, probably the Ruscus hypoglossum of Linnæus, sometimes known,\r\nhowever, as the Alexandrian laurel.\r\n\r\n[2101] Or “eunuch” laurel; a variety, probably, of the Laurus nobilis.\r\n\r\n[2102] The “ground laurel:” according to Sprengel, this is the Ruscus\r\nracemosus of Linnæus. See B. xxiv. c. 81.\r\n\r\n[2103] From Alexandria in Troas: the Ruscus hypophyllum of Linnæus, it\r\nis supposed.\r\n\r\n[2104] “The tongue below.” This, Fée justly says, would appear to be a\r\nmore appropriate name for the taxa, mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[2105] From the berry being attached to the leaf.\r\n\r\n[2106] “The thrower out from below,” perhaps.\r\n\r\n[2107] Sprengel thinks that it is the Clematis vitalba of Linnæus.\r\nFuchsius identities it with the Daphne laureola of Linnæus; and Fée\r\nthinks it may be either that or the Daphne mezereum of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2108] “Crown of Alexander.”\r\n\r\n[2109] Curiously enough, it is generally considered now more suggestive\r\nof war than of peace.\r\n\r\n[2110] The despatches were wrapped in laurel leaves.\r\n\r\n[2111] Optimus Maximus.\r\n\r\n[2112] L. Junius Brutus, the nephew of Tarquin. Pliny alludes to the\r\nmessage sent to Delphi, for the purpose of consulting the oracle on a\r\nserpent being seen in the royal palace.\r\n\r\n[2113] He alludes to the circumstance of the priestess being asked who\r\nshould reign at Rome after Tarquin; upon which she answered, “He who\r\nfirst kisses his mother;” on which Brutus, the supposed idiot, stumbled\r\nto the ground, and kissed the earth, the mother of all.\r\n\r\n[2114] A mere absurdity; the same has been said of the beech, and with\r\nequal veracity.\r\n\r\n[2115] He makes a distinction between “altar” and “ara” here. The\r\nformer was the altar of the superior Divinities, the latter of the\r\nsuperior and inferior as well.\r\n\r\n[2116] The crackling of the laurel is caused by efforts of the\r\nessential oil to escape from the parenchyma or cellular tissue of the\r\nleaf, which it breaks with considerable violence when burning.\r\n\r\n[2117] Nervorum. See B. xxiii. c. 80.\r\n\r\n[2118] Suetonius, c. 66, confirms this. Fée says that the same\r\nsuperstition still exists in some parts of France. See B. ii. c. 56.\r\n\r\n[2119] “The Poultry.”\r\n\r\n[2120] See c. 39 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2121] See B. xxxi. c. 3. As Poinsinet remarks, this is not strictly\r\ntrue; the name “Vinucius” most probably came from “vinea,” a vineyard.\r\nNumerous names were derived also from seeds and vegetables; Piso,\r\nCicero, and Lactuca, for instance, among a host of others. “Scipio,”\r\ntoo, means a “walking-stick.”\r\n\r\n[2122] The “laurel-grove.”\r\n\r\n[2123] See B. xvii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2124] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2125] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2126] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2127] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2128] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2129] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2130] See end of B. x.\r\n\r\n[2131] See end of B. xi.\r\n\r\n[2132] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2133] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2134] See end of B. x.\r\n\r\n[2135] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2136] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2137] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2138] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2139] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2140] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2141] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2142] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2143] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2144] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2145] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2146] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2147] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2148] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2149] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2150] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2151] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2152] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2153] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2154] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2155] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2156] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2157] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2158] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2159] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[2160] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2161] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2162] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2163] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2164] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2165] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2166] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2167] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2168] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2169] See end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[2170] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2171] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2172] He is mentioned also by Varro and Columella, as a writer upon\r\nagriculture; but all further particulars of him are unknown.\r\n\r\n[2173] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2174] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2175] See end of B. x.\r\n\r\n[2176] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2177] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2178] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2179] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2180] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2181] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2182] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2183] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2184] See end of B. xi.\r\n\r\n[2185] Beyond what Pliny here says, nothing is known of him.\r\n\r\n[2186] See end of B. xi.\r\n\r\n[2187] A physician who lived probably at the end of the first century\r\nB.C. He was a disciple of Erasistratus, and founded a medical school\r\nat Smyrna. He is quoted by Athenæus, and in B. xxvii. c. 14, Pliny\r\ncalls him “a physician of no small authority.” He seems to have been a\r\nvoluminous writer; but none of his works have survived.\r\n\r\n[2188] See end of B. xi.\r\n\r\n[2189] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2190] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[2191] The methods of grafting and inoculation.\r\n\r\n[2192] B. xiii. c. 50. They dwelt between the Ems and the Elbe.\r\n\r\n[2193] See B. iv. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2194] “Ulvâ.” This appears to be a general name for all kinds of\r\naquatic fresh-water plants; as “alga” is that of the various sea-weeds.\r\n\r\n[2195] He alludes to turf for firing; the Humus turfa of the\r\nnaturalists.\r\n\r\n[2196] Of course this applies only to those who dwelt near the\r\nsea-shore, and not those more inland.\r\n\r\n[2197] Guichardin remarks, that Pliny does not here bear in mind the\r\nsweets of liberty.\r\n\r\n[2198] So Laberius says, “Fortuna multis parcere in pœnam solet;”\r\n“Fortune is the saving of many, when she means to punish them.”\r\n\r\n[2199] He alludes to the vicinity of the Zuyder Zee. See B. iv. c. 29.\r\nThe spots where these forests once stood are now cultivated plains,\r\ncovered with villages and other works of the industry of man.\r\n\r\n[2200] “Quercus.” We shall see, in the course of this Book, that its\r\nidentity has not been satisfactorily established.\r\n\r\n[2201] See B. iv. c. 28, and the Note, Vol. i. p. 348. The village of\r\nHercingen, near Waldsee, is supposed to retain the ancient name.\r\n\r\n[2202] “Robora.” It will be seen in this Book that the robur has not\r\nbeen identified, any more than the quercus.\r\n\r\n[2203] Fée treats this story as utterly fabulous. The branches of the\r\nFicus Indica grow downwards, and so form arcades certainly; but such is\r\nnot the case with any European tree.\r\n\r\n[2204] Not only oaks, but a variety of other trees, were included under\r\nthis name by the ancients; the “glans” embracing not only the acorn,\r\nbut the mast of the beech, and the hard fruits of other trees\r\n\r\n[2205] He alludes to the crown of oak-leaves, which was suspended on\r\nthe gates before the palace of the emperors. A civic crown had been\r\nvoted by the senate to Julius Cæsar, on the ground of having saved his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[2206] Given to the first man who scaled the wall of a besieged place.\r\nIt was made of gold, and decorated with turrets.\r\n\r\n[2207] Given to the first soldier who surmounted the vallum or\r\nentrenchments. It was made of gold, and ornamented with “valli,” or\r\npalisades.\r\n\r\n[2208] One of the varieties of the triumphal crown was the “corona\r\naurea,” or “golden crown.”\r\n\r\n[2209] Made of gold, and decorated with the “rostra,” or “beaks” of\r\nships.\r\n\r\n[2210] See B. vii. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[2211] The orator’s stage in the Forum was decorated with the “rostra,”\r\nor “beaks” of the ships of the Antiates; hence it received the name of\r\n“Rostrum.” The locality of the Rostra was changed by Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[2212] Alluding to the prostitution of the Rostra by the tribunes and\r\nothers for the purposes of sedition, and the presentation by Augustus\r\nof the rostrate crown to Agrippa.\r\n\r\n[2213] Which was suspended, as already mentioned, at the gate of his\r\npalace.\r\n\r\n[2214] Athenæus and Fabius Pictor say that Janus was the first wearer\r\nof a crown; Pherecydes says it was Saturn, Diodorus Siculus Jupiter,\r\nand Leo Ægyptiacus Isis, who wore one of wheat.\r\n\r\n[2215] Il. xiii, 736.\r\n\r\n[2216] See cc. 34 and 35 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2217] The Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemæan games.\r\n\r\n[2218] See B. vii. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[2219] He is called Tullus Hostilius by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the\r\nsame as his grandson.\r\n\r\n[2220] A.U.C. 411. The leaves of the holm-oak were employed by Romulus\r\non the occasion above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2221] These varieties of the oak will be considered in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[2222] At the Olympic games celebrated in honour of Jupiter. At Olympia\r\nthere was a statue of that god, one of the master-pieces of Phidias.\r\n\r\n[2223] Implying thereby, that the city that could produce a man who\r\ncould so distinguish himself, stood in no need of walls.\r\n\r\n[2224] In the Circus.\r\n\r\n[2225] In B. vii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2226] B. vii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2227] Livy says eight. He saved the life of Servilius, the Master of\r\nthe Horse.\r\n\r\n[2228] “Glandes.” Under this name, for which we do not appear to have\r\nany English equivalent, were included, as already mentioned, not only\r\nthe acorn of the oak, but the nut or mast of the beech, and probably\r\nmost of the hard or kernel fruits. In the present instance Pliny\r\nprobably alludes only to the fruit of the oak and the beech. Acorns are\r\nbut little used as an article of food in these days. Roasted, they have\r\nbeen proposed as a substitute for coffee.\r\n\r\n[2229] The acorn of the Quercus ballota of Linnæus is probably\r\nmeant, which is still much used in the province of Salamanca, and\r\nforms an agreeable article of food. This acorn, Fée says, contains a\r\nconsiderable proportion of saccharine matter, and is better roasted in\r\nthe ashes than boiled in water. It is not, however, used as a dessert,\r\nas in the time of the Romans. These acorns are sold at market in\r\nAndalusia in the month of October.\r\n\r\n[2230] So far as it goes, the kernel of the mast or beech-nut is not\r\nunpalatable; but in the English beech it is very diminutive.\r\n\r\n[2231] The word “quercus” is frequently used as a general name for the\r\noak; but throughout the present Book it is most employed as meaning a\r\ndistinct variety of the oak, one of the larger kinds, Fée says, and\r\nanswering to the Quercus racemosa of Lamarck, the Quercus robur of\r\nLinnæus, and the Rouvre of the French.\r\n\r\n[2232] This also has been much employed as a general name for the\r\noak; but here, and in other parts of this Book, it is applied to one\r\nvariety. Fée thinks that it answers to the Quercus sessiliflora of\r\nSmith, sometimes also called “rouvre” by the French.\r\n\r\n[2233] The Quercus æsculus of Linnæus. It is not improbable that this\r\noak is a different tree from the “Æsculus” of Horace and Virgil, which\r\nwas perhaps either a walnut, or a variety of the beech.\r\n\r\n[2234] It has been suggested that this is the same with the Quercus\r\ncerrus of Linnæus, and the Quercus crinita of Lamarck, the gland of\r\nwhich is placed in a prickly cupule. It is rarely found in France, but\r\nis often to be met with in Piedmont and the Apennines.\r\n\r\n[2235] The Fagus silvatica of Lamarck. Its Latin name, “fagus,” is\r\nsupposed to have been derived from the Greek φάγω, “to eat.” An oil is\r\nextracted from the acorns or nuts, that is much used in some parts of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[2236] He speaks probably of one of the galls which are found attached\r\nto the leaves of the forest trees.\r\n\r\n[2237] “Ilex.” Fée thinks that the varieties known as the Prinos and\r\nthe Ballota were often confounded by the ancients with the “ilex” or\r\n“holm-oak.” This tree, he says, bears no resemblance to the ordinary\r\noak, except in the blossoms and the fruit. It is the Ilex of Linnæus,\r\nthe “yeuse,” or “green oak,” of the French.\r\n\r\n[2238] The Quercus suber of Linnæus; it is found more particularly in\r\nthe department of the Landes in France.\r\n\r\n[2239] As Fée remarks, Pliny is clearly in error here; one kind being\r\nthe veritable ilex or holm oak, the other, the aquifolium or holly,\r\nquite a different tree.\r\n\r\n[2240] The smilax or milax was a real holm oak, but the aquifolia was\r\nthe holly.\r\n\r\n[2241] Od. xi. 242. Fée remarks that the berry of the holly has no\r\nresemblance to the acorn whatever, and he says that this statement of\r\nPliny almost leads him to think that the second variety here mentioned\r\nby him was not in reality the holly, but a variety of the quercus.\r\n\r\n[2242] Fée observes that, properly speaking, there is no sex in the\r\noak, the individuals being neither male nor female. The Flora Danica\r\nhowever, as he observes, gives the name of “Quercus fœmina” to the\r\nQuercus racemosa of Lamarck.\r\n\r\n[2243] Or “broad-leaved” oak; one of the varieties of the Quercus\r\nsessiliflora of Smith—_Flor. Brit._\r\n\r\n[2244] This statement is contrary to general experience in modern\r\ntimes, the flavour of the acorn being uniformly acrid and bitter\r\nthroughout. It is not impossible, however, that the flavour may have\r\nbeen more palatable in ancient times.\r\n\r\n[2245] A variety of the common oak, the Quercus racemosa of Lamarck;\r\nSprengel takes it to be the Quercus ballota of Desfontaines.\r\n\r\n[2246] The Quercus ægilops of Linnæus. It is a native of Piedmont, some\r\nparts of Italy, and the island of Crete.\r\n\r\n[2247] Pliny’s account of making charcoal is derived from Theophrastus,\r\nB. iii. c. 10. Fée remarks that it differs little from the method\r\nadopted in France at the present day.\r\n\r\n[2248] The Quercus Hispanica, probably, of Lamarck, of which Fée thinks\r\nthe Quercus pseudo-suber of Desfontaines is a variety; it is found in\r\nGreece and on the shores of the Mediterranean, near Gibraltar. The\r\nGreek name signifies the “sea cork-tree.”\r\n\r\n[2249] The statement here given as to the effect of beech-mast on\r\nswine, is destitute, Fée remarks, of all foundation. If fed upon it,\r\ntheir flesh will naturally be of a soft, spongy nature.\r\n\r\n[2250] This assertion is perhaps too general; gall-nuts are produced in\r\nvery small quantities by the holm-oak.\r\n\r\n[2251] A variety of the Quercus racemosa, which produces the green\r\ngall-nut of Aleppo, considered in modern, as in ancient, times the\r\nchoicest in quality.\r\n\r\n[2252] Theophrastus says the end of June.\r\n\r\n[2253] Its growth, in reality, is not so rapid as this.\r\n\r\n[2254] Such a thing is never seen at the present day.\r\n\r\n[2255] In Syria, we have mentioned the galls of Aleppo in Note [2251].\r\n\r\n[2256] This is the case when the inside has been eaten away by the\r\ninsect that breeds there; of course, in such case it is hollow, light,\r\nand worthless.\r\n\r\n[2257] The ancients were not aware that the gall was produced from the\r\neggs of the cynips, deposited upon the leaf or bark of the tree. Tan\r\nand gallic acid are its principal component parts.\r\n\r\n[2258] A substance quite unknown now; but it is very doubtful if Pliny\r\nis rightly informed here.\r\n\r\n[2259] A fungous gall, produced by the Cynips fungosa. It is not used\r\nfor any domestic purpose at the present day.\r\n\r\n[2260] This kind of gall is now unknown. Fée questions the assertion\r\nabout its juice.\r\n\r\n[2261] The Cynips quercus baccarum of Linnæus, one of the common galls.\r\n\r\n[2262] The root cynips, the Cynips radicum of Fourcroi, produces these\r\ngalls, which lie near the root, and have the appearance of ligneous\r\nnodosities. It is harder than wood, and contains cells, in which the\r\nlarva of the insect lies coiled up.\r\n\r\n[2263] This is a proof, as Fée remarks, that the ancients had observed\r\nthe existence of the cynips; though, at the same time, it is equally\r\nevident that they did not know the important part it acts in the\r\nformation of the gall.\r\n\r\n[2264] This word, as employed by Theophrastus, means a catkin, the\r\nJulus amentum of the botanists; but it is doubtful if Pliny attaches\r\nthis meaning to the word, as the lime or linden-tree has no catkin, but\r\nan inflorescence of a different character. It is not improbable that,\r\nunder this name, he alludes to some excrescence.\r\n\r\n[2265] These were the “boletus” and the “suillus” the last of which\r\nseem only to have been recently introduced at table in the time of\r\nPliny. See B. xxii. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[2266] He alludes clearly to fungi of radically different qualities,\r\nas the nature of the trees beneath which they grow cannot possibly\r\ninfluence them, any further than by the various proportions of shade\r\nthey afford. The soil, however, exercises great influence on the\r\nquality of the fungus; growing upon a hill, it may be innoxious, while\r\nin a wet soil it may be productive of death.\r\n\r\n[2267] See cc. 93, 94, and 95, of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2268] Works and Days, l. 230.\r\n\r\n[2269] Pliny seems to have here taken in a literal sense, what has been\r\nsaid figuratively by Virgil, Ecl. iv. l. 26:\r\n\r\n  “Et duræ quercus sudabunt roscida mella;”\r\n\r\nand by Ovid, in relation to the Golden Age, Met. i. 113:\r\n\r\n  “Flavaque de viridi stillabant ilice mella.”\r\n\r\nFée remarks, that we find on the leaf of the lime-tree a thin, sugary\r\ndeposit, left by insects, and that a species of manna exudes from the\r\nConiferæ, as also the bark of the beech. This, however, is never the\r\ncase with the oak.\r\n\r\n[2270] B. xi. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[2271] By this word, Fée observes, we must not understand the word\r\n“nitre,” in the modern sense, but the sub-carbonate of potash;\r\nwhile the ashes of trees growing on the shores of the sea produce a\r\nsub-carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n[2272] “Coccus.” This is not a gall, but the distended body of an\r\ninsect, the kermes, which grows on a peculiar oak, the “Quercus\r\ncoccifera,” found in the south of Europe.\r\n\r\n[2273] We have previously mentioned, that he seems to have confounded\r\nthe holly with the holm oak.\r\n\r\n[2274] Poinsinet, rather absurdly, as it would appear, finds in this\r\nword the origin of our word “cochineal.”\r\n\r\n[2275] The kermes berry is but little used in Spain, or, indeed,\r\nanywhere else, since the discovery of the cochineal of America.\r\n\r\n[2276] B. ix. c. 65.\r\n\r\n[2277] Not the white agaric, Fée says, of modern pharmacy; but, as\r\nno kind of agaric is found in the oak, it does not seem possible to\r\nidentify it. See B. xxv. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[2278] It is evident that no fungus would give out phosphoric light;\r\nbut it may have resulted from old wood in a state of decomposition.\r\n\r\n[2279] It is pretty clear that one of the lichens of the genus _usnea_\r\nis here referred to. Amadue, or German tinder, seems somewhat similar.\r\n\r\n[2280] B. xii. c. 50.\r\n\r\n[2281] On the contrary, Fée says, the acorn of the Quercus suber is of\r\na sweet and agreeable flavour, and is much sought as a food for pigs.\r\nThe hams of Bayonne are said to owe their high reputation to the acorns\r\nof the cork-tree.\r\n\r\n[2282] The word “cork” is clearly derived from the Latin “cortex,”\r\n“bark.” See Beckmann’s History of Inventions, V. i. p. 320, _et seq._,\r\n_Bohn’s Edition_, for a very interesting account of this tree.\r\n\r\n[2283] This passage, the meaning of which is so obvious, is discussed\r\nat some length by Beckmann, Vol. i. pp. 321, 322.\r\n\r\n[2284] It is still employed for making soles which are impervious to\r\nthe wet.\r\n\r\n[2285] It is doubtful whether this name was given to the shoes, or the\r\nfemales who wore them, and we have therefore preserved the doubt, in\r\nthe ambiguous “them.” Beckmann also discusses this passage, p. 321. He\r\ninforms us, p. 322, that the Roman ladies who wished to appear taller\r\nthan they really were, were in the habit of putting plenty of cork\r\nunder their soles.\r\n\r\n[2286] At the present day, it grows in the greatest abundance in\r\nFrance, the Landes more particularly.\r\n\r\n[2287] This is still the case in some of the poorer provinces of Spain.\r\n\r\n[2288] As Fée remarks, Mars is no longer the Divinity in honour of whom\r\ncharacters are traced on the bark of trees.\r\n\r\n[2289] On the contrary. Fée says, the resinous woods are the most proof\r\nof all against the action of the air.\r\n\r\n[2290] Festus says that the Fagutal, a shrine of Jupiter, was so called\r\nfrom a beech tree (fagus) that stood there, and was sacred to that god.\r\n\r\n[2291] Or osier.\r\n\r\n[2292] Or “plantation of the æsculus.”\r\n\r\n[2293] A.U.C. 367.\r\n\r\n[2294] Fée regards this as an extremely doubtful assertion.\r\n\r\n[2295] The Pinus pinea of Linnæus, the cultivated pine.\r\n\r\n[2296] The Pinus silvestris of Linnæus, the wild pine; the Pinus\r\nmaritima of Lamarck is a variety of it.\r\n\r\n[2297] B. xv. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2298] In c. 23 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2299] A variety of the Pinus silvestris of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2300] “Liburnicæ.” See B. ix. cc. 5 and 48.\r\n\r\n[2301] The Abies excelsa of Decandolle—the _Pesse_ or _Faux sapin_\r\n(false fir) of the French. This tree, however, has not the pectinated,\r\nor comb-like leaf, mentioned by Pliny in c. 38.\r\n\r\n[2302] It is still known in commerce as “false incense;” and is often\r\nsold as incense for the rites of the Roman church: while sometimes it\r\nis purposely employed, as being cheaper.\r\n\r\n[2303] A great street in Capua, which consisted entirely of the shops\r\nof sellers of unguents and perfumes.\r\n\r\n[2304] It has the same pyramidal form as the pitch-tree. It is still\r\nmuch used in ship-building, both for its resinous and durable qualities\r\nand the lightness of the wood.\r\n\r\n[2305] The presence of resin is _not_ looked upon as any defect in\r\nthe fir at the present day. It produces what is known in commerce as\r\n“Strasbourg turpentine.”\r\n\r\n[2306] The Abies larix of Linnæus, and the Larix Europæa, it is\r\nthought, of Decandolles.\r\n\r\n[2307] It is the Venice turpentine of commerce. Each tree will furnish\r\nseven or eight pounds each year for half a century.\r\n\r\n[2308] It is doubtful if the tæda, or torch-tree, has been identified.\r\nSome take it to be the Pinus mugho of Miller, the torch-pine of the\r\nFrench; others, again, suggest that it is the same as the Pinus cembro\r\nof the botanists.\r\n\r\n[2309] So called from its resemblance to a fig. Fée says that there is\r\nlittle doubt that this pretended fruit was merely a resinous secretion,\r\nwhich hardens and assumes the form of a fig.\r\n\r\n[2310] He somewhat mistranslates a passage of Theophrastus here, who,\r\nwithout transforming the larch into another tree, says that it is a\r\nsign of disease in the larch, when its secretions are augmented to such\r\na degree that it seems to turn itself into resin.\r\n\r\n[2311] The lamp-black of commerce is made from the soot of the pine.\r\n\r\n[2312] This statement, though supported by that of Vitruvius, B. ii. c.\r\n9, is quite erroneous. The wood of the larch gives out more heat than\r\nthat of the fir, and produces more live coal in proportion.\r\n\r\n[2313] This, Fée remarks, is the fact.\r\n\r\n[2314] This description is inexact, and we should have some difficulty\r\nin recognizing here the larch as known to us.\r\n\r\n[2315] Pliny is in error here, there being no distinction of sex in\r\nthe coniferous trees. All that he relates relative to the differences\r\nbetween the male and female pine is consequently false. He has,\r\nhowever, in this instance, only perpetuated an erroneous opinion of\r\nTheophrastus.\r\n\r\n[2316] This is an erroneous statement. The larch has its cone, as well\r\nas the rest. It is possible, however, that its small size may have\r\ncaused it to be overlooked by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2317] Or “louse-bearing.” As Fée says, it is difficult to see the\r\nanalogy.\r\n\r\n[2318] The Taxus baccata of Linnæus. The account here given is in\r\ngeneral very correct.\r\n\r\n[2319] It is supposed that Pliny derives this notion as to the yew\r\nberry from Julius Cæsar, who says that “Cativulcus killed himself with\r\nthe yew, a tree which grows in great abundance in Gaul and Germany.”\r\nIt is, however, now known that the berry is quite innocuous; but the\r\nleaves and shoots are destructive of animal life.\r\n\r\n[2320] “Viatoria;” probably not unlike our travelling flasks and\r\npocket-pistols. This statement made by Pliny is not at all improbable.\r\n\r\n[2321] This statement does not deserve a serious contradiction.\r\n\r\n[2322] It is not improbable, however, that τόξον, an “arrow,” is of\r\nolder date than “taxus,” as signifying the name of the yew.\r\n\r\n[2323] Numerous varieties of the coniferæ supply us with tar, and Pliny\r\nis in error in deriving it solely from the torch-tree, the Pinus mugho\r\nof Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2324] See B. xxiv. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[2325] It is still obtained in a similar way.\r\n\r\n[2326] Fée remarks, that Pliny is in error here; this red, watery\r\nfluid formed in the extraction of tars, being quite a different thing\r\nfrom “cedrium,” the _alkitran_ or _kitran_ of the Arabs; which is not\r\nimprobably made from a cedar, or perhaps the Juniperus Phœnicea, called\r\n“Cedrus” by the two Bauhins and Tournefort. He says that it is not\r\nlikely that the Egyptians would use this red substance for the purpose\r\nof preserving the dead, charged as it is with empyreumatic oil, and\r\ndestitute of all properties peculiar to resins.\r\n\r\n[2327] See B. xxi. c. 3, and B. xxiv. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[2328] This is impracticable; neither vinegar, wine, nor water, will\r\nmingle with pitch. These resins, however, if stirred up briskly in hot\r\nwater, become of a paler colour, and acquire an additional suppleness.\r\n\r\n[2329] Perhaps so called from Calabria, a country where the pine\r\nabounded, and part of which was called Bruttium.\r\n\r\n[2330] Or wine-vats.\r\n\r\n[2331] See c. 8 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2332] Stillaticia.\r\n\r\n[2333] See B. xiv. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[2334] This operation removes from the pitch a great portion of its\r\nessential oil, and disengages it of any extraneous bodies that may have\r\nbeen mixed with it.\r\n\r\n[2335] Fée remarks that there is no necessity for this selection,\r\nthough no doubt rain-water is superior to spring or cistern water, for\r\nsome purposes, from its holding no terreous salts in solution.\r\n\r\n[2336] This would colour the resin more strongly, Fée says, and give it\r\na greater degree of friability.\r\n\r\n[2337] See B. xxxiv. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[2338] See B. xiv. c. 25, and B. xxiv. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[2339] “Sartago.” Generally understood to be the same as our\r\nfrying-pan. Fée remarks that this method would most inevitably cause\r\nthe mass infusion to ignite; and should such not be the case, a\r\ncoloured resin would be the result, coloured with a large quantity\r\nof carbon, and destitute of all the essential oil that the resin\r\noriginally contained.\r\n\r\n[2340] See B. xiv. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[2341] The terebinthine of the mastich, Fée says, is an oleo-resin, or\r\nin other words, composed of an essential oil and a resin.\r\n\r\n[2342] Apparently meaning “boiled pitch.”\r\n\r\n[2343] See B. xxiv. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[2344] This account has been borrowed from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant.\r\nB ix. c. ii. The modern method of extracting the resin of the pine is\r\nvery similar.\r\n\r\n[2345] There is no foundation whatever for this statement.\r\n\r\n[2346] The pith of the pine cannot be separated from the wood, and,\r\nindeed, is not easily distinguished from it. Fée says that in some\r\nof these trees masses of resin are found in the cavities which run\r\nlongitudinally with the fibres, and queries whether this may not be the\r\n“marrow” or “pith” of the tree mentioned by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2347] As a torch or candle, probably.\r\n\r\n[2348] This division of the larch into sexes, as previously mentioned,\r\nis only fanciful, and has no foundation in fact. The result of this\r\noperation, Fée says, would be only a sort of tar.\r\n\r\n[2349] See B. xxxv. c. 51. He alludes to the bitumen known as asphalt,\r\nbitumen of Judæa, mineral pitch, mountain pitch, malthe, pissalphate.\r\n\r\n[2350] These particulars, borrowed from Theophrastus, are in general\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n[2351] This is not the fact; the essential oil in which the resin so\r\ngreatly abounds, becomes volatile with remarkable facility.\r\n\r\n[2352] Most probably one of the varieties of the pine; but the mode in\r\nwhich Pliny expresses himself renders it impossible to identify it with\r\nany precision.\r\n\r\n[2353] B. xv. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2354] The name borne also by the torch-tree.\r\n\r\n[2355] See c. 76 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2356] He does not speak in this place of the “ornus” or “mountain\r\nash;” nor, as Fée observes, does he mention the use of the bark of the\r\nash as a febrifuge, or of its leaves as a purgative. This ash is the\r\nFraxinus excelsior of Decandolles.\r\n\r\n[2357] Il. xxiv. 277.\r\n\r\n[2358] Pliny makes a mistake here, in copying from Theophrastus, who\r\nsays that it is the yew that bears so strong a resemblance to the cedar.\r\n\r\n[2359] Or “bull’s-ash.” This variety does not seem to have been\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n[2360] This statement results from his misinterpretation of the\r\nlanguage of Theophrastus, who is really speaking of the yew, which\r\nPliny mistakes for the ash.\r\n\r\n[2361] Miller asserts that, if given to cows, this leaf will impart\r\na bad flavour to the milk; a statement which; Fée says, is quite\r\nincorrect.\r\n\r\n[2362] A merely fanciful notion, without apparently the slightest\r\nfoundation: the same, too, may be said of the alleged antipathy of the\r\nserpent to the beech-tree, which is neither venomous nor odoriferous.\r\n\r\n[2363] This story of Pliny has been corroborated by M. de Verone, and\r\nas strongly contradicted by Camerarius and Charras: with M. Fée, then,\r\nwe must leave it to the reader to judge which is the most likely to\r\nbe speaking the truth. It is not improbable that Pliny may have been\r\nimposed upon, as his credulity would not at all times preclude him from\r\nbeing duped.\r\n\r\n[2364] There is no such distinction in the linden or lime, as the\r\nflowers are hermaphroditical. They are merely two varieties: the male\r\nof Pliny being the Tilia microphylla of Decandolles, and a variety\r\nof the Tilia Europæa of Linnæus; and the female being the Tilia\r\nplatyphyllos, another variety of the Tilia Europæa of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2365] Not at all singular, Fée says, the fruit being dry and insipid.\r\n\r\n[2366] In France these cords are still made, and are used for\r\nwell-ropes, wheat-sheafs, &c. In the north of France, too, brooms are\r\nmade of the outer bark, and the same is the case in Westphalia.\r\n\r\n[2367] See B. xxi. c. 4. Ovid, Fasti, B. v. l. 337, speaks of the\r\nrevellers at drunken banquets binding their hair with the philyra.\r\n\r\n[2368] “Teredo.” If he means under this name to include the tinea as\r\nwell, the assertion is far too general, as this wood is eaten away\r\nby insects, though more slowly than the majority of the non-resinous\r\nwoods. It is sometimes perforated quite through by the larvæ of the\r\nbyrrhus, our death-watch.\r\n\r\n[2369] This is incorrect. It attains a very considerable height, and\r\nsometimes an enormous size. The trunk is known to grow to as much as\r\nforty or fifty feet in circumference.\r\n\r\n[2370] The maple is much less in size than what the lime or linden\r\nreally is.\r\n\r\n[2371] See B. xiii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2372] Fée says there are but five varieties of the maple known in\r\nFrance. He doubts whether the common maple, the Acer campestre of\r\nLinnæus, was known to the ancients.\r\n\r\n[2373] Fée identifies it with the Acer pseudo-platanus of Linnæus, the\r\nAcer montanum candidum of C. Bauhin. This tree is not uncommon in Italy.\r\n\r\n[2374] “Acer pavonaceum:” “peacock maple.” He gives a similar account\r\nof the spots on the wood of the citrus, B. xiii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2375] Or “thick-veined” maple.\r\n\r\n[2376] Supposed by Fée to be the Acer Monspessulanus of Linnæus, also\r\nthe Acer trilobum of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2377] A variety of the Acer pseudo-platanus of Linnæus, according to\r\nFée.\r\n\r\n[2378] The Carpinus betulus of Linnæus; the horn-beam or yoke-elm.\r\n\r\n[2379] “Silicios.” This word appears to be explained by the\r\naccompanying word “laminas;” but it is very doubtful what is the\r\ncorrect reading.\r\n\r\n[2380] The Alnus glutinosa of Decandolles. In c. 38, Pliny says, very\r\nincorrectly, that the alder has a remarkably thick leaf; and in c. 45,\r\nwith equal incorrectness, that it bears neither seed nor fruit.\r\n\r\n[2381] Fée observes, that it is incorrect to say that the male tree\r\nblossoms before the female, if such is Pliny’s meaning here.\r\n\r\n[2382] From the Greek, meaning “a tree with clusters.” It is the\r\nStaphylea pinnata of Linnæus, the wild or false pistachio of the French.\r\n\r\n[2383] “Siliqua.” This term, Fée says, is very inappropriate to the\r\nfruit of this tree, which is contained in a membranous capsule. The\r\nkernel is oily, and has the taste of the almond more than the nut.\r\n\r\n[2384] The Buxus sempervirens of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2385] It is still extensively used for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\n[2386] There are only two species now known: that previously mentioned,\r\nand the Buxus Balearica of Lamarck. The first is divided into the four\r\nvarieties, arborescens, angustifolia, suffruticosa, and myrtifolia.\r\n\r\n[2387] The Buxus sempervirens of Linnæus; very common in the south of\r\nFrance, and on the banks of the Loire.\r\n\r\n[2388] It is doubtful if this is a box at all. The wild olive,\r\nmentioned in B. xv. c. 7, has the same name; all the varieties of the\r\nbox emit a disagreeable smell.\r\n\r\n[2389] A variety of the Buxus sempervirens, the same as the Buxus\r\nsuffruticosa of Lamarck.\r\n\r\n[2390] The Pyrenean box is mostly of the arborescent kind.\r\n\r\n[2391] In Phrygia. See B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2392] The arborescent variety.\r\n\r\n[2393] This is doubted by Fée, but it is by no means impossible.\r\nIn Pennsylvania the bees collect a poisonous honey from the Kalmia\r\nlatifolia.\r\n\r\n[2394] A very good charcoal might be made from it, but the wood is too\r\nvaluable for such a purpose. It burns with a bright, clear flame, and\r\nthrows out a considerable heat.\r\n\r\n[2395] Although (in common, too, with other trees) it is used as a\r\nsupport for the vine, that does not any the more make it of the same\r\nnature as the fruit-trees.\r\n\r\n[2396] The Ulmus effusa of Willdenow; the Ulmus montana of Smith:\r\n_Flor. Brit._\r\n\r\n[2397] The Ulmus campestris of Linnæus; the Ulmus marita of other\r\nbotanists.\r\n\r\n[2398] The ordinary elm, Fée thinks.\r\n\r\n[2399] A variety of the Ulmus campestris, probably.\r\n\r\n[2400] This name is still preserved by botanists. Pliny is incorrect in\r\nsaying that the large elm produces no seed, the only difference being\r\nthat the seed is smaller than in the other kinds. Columella, B. v.\r\nc. 6, contradicts the statement here made by Pliny, but says that it\r\n_appears_ to be sterile, in comparison with the others.\r\n\r\n[2401] The Pinus maritima of Linnæus, which produces the greater part\r\nof the resins used in France, is found, however, in great abundance in\r\nthe flat country of the Landes.\r\n\r\n[2402] On the contrary, the yoke-elm, or horn-beam, grows almost\r\nexclusively on the plains; and the same with the cornel and the poplar.\r\n\r\n[2403] The Rhus cotinus of Linnæus, the fustic. See B. xiii. c. 41.\r\nThis, however, imparts a yellow colour, while Pliny speaks of a purple.\r\nIt has been asserted, however, that the roots of it produce a fine red.\r\nThere is no tree in Europe that produces a purple for dyeing.\r\n\r\n[2404] The maple, the ash, and the service-tree, are as often found in\r\nthe plains as on the hills.\r\n\r\n[2405] See c. 43, and B. xxiv. c. 43. The Cornus sanguinea of Linnæus,\r\nthe blood-red cornel; the branches of which are red in the winter, and\r\nthe fruit filled with a blood-red juice. This is probably the same\r\nshrub as the male cornel, mentioned further on by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2406] The Genista tinctoria of Linnæus, or “dyers’” broom.\r\n\r\n[2407] Or “service-tree,” the Sorbus domestica of Linnæus. It thrives\r\njust as well in a warm locality as a cold one.\r\n\r\n[2408] The Betula alba of Linnæus. It was an object of terror not only\r\nin the hands of the Roman lictor, but in those of the pedagogue also,\r\nand is still to some extent. Hence it was formerly nicknamed “Arbor\r\nsapientiæ,” the “tree of wisdom.”\r\n\r\n[2409] This is no longer done in France, but it is in Russia, where\r\nthey extract from it an empyreumatic oil, which is used in preparing\r\nRussia leather, and which imparts to it its agreeable smell.\r\n\r\n[2410] Boys, both of whose parents were surviving, used to carry before\r\nthe bride a torch of white thorn. This thorn was, not improbably, the\r\n“Cratægus oxyacantha” of Linnæus, which bears a white flower. See B.\r\nxxiv. c. 66.\r\n\r\n[2411] The Cytisus laburnum of Linnæus, also known as “false ebony,”\r\nstill a native of the Alps.\r\n\r\n[2412] But blackish in the centre; whence its name of false ebony.\r\n\r\n[2413] Meaning the clusters of the flowers.\r\n\r\n[2414] The Anthyllis barba Jovis of modern botanists. The leaves have\r\nupon them a silvery down, whence the name “argyrophylla,” given to it\r\nby Mænch.\r\n\r\n[2415] But in c. 30, he says that the poplar grows on hilly or\r\nmountainous declivities.\r\n\r\n[2416] This tree has not been satisfactorily identified; but Fée is\r\nof opinion that it is probably a variety of the willow, the Salix\r\nvitellina of Linnæus. Sprengel thinks that it is the Salix capræa.\r\n\r\n[2417] The Ligustrum vulgare of Linnæus. It has black fruit and a white\r\nflower, and is rendered famous by the lines of Virgil—Ecl. ii. 17:\r\n\r\n  “O formose puer, nimium ne crede colori;\r\n   Alba ligustra cadunt, vaccinia nigra leguntur.”\r\n\r\nIt is evidently this juxtaposition that has prompted Pliny to mention\r\nthe vaccinium in the succeeding passage. In B. xii. c. 51, and B. xxiv.\r\nc. 45, Pliny seems inclined to confound this shrub with the Cyprus, the\r\nLawsonia inermis of Linnæus, the Henna of the east, a totally different\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n[2418] Wooden tallies used by public officers in keeping their\r\naccounts. They were employed till the middle ages.\r\n\r\n[2419] The Primus mahaleb, Desfontaines says; but Fée identifies it\r\nwith the black heath-berry, or whortle-berry, still called “vaciet” in\r\nFrance. It does not, however, grow, as Pliny says, in watery places,\r\nbut in woods and on shrubby hills.\r\n\r\n[2420] See B. xxi. c. 97.\r\n\r\n[2421] These observations, Fée says, are borrowed from Theophrastus,\r\nHist. Plant. B. iii. c. 4, and are founded on truth.\r\n\r\n[2422] “Silvestres,” and “urbaniores.”\r\n\r\n[2423] Urbanæ.\r\n\r\n[2424] The Nerion oleander of Linnæus; the laurel-rose, or rose of\r\nSt. Anthony of the French; it has some distant resemblance to the\r\nolive-tree, but its leaf is that of the laurel, and its flower very\r\nsimilar to that of the rose.\r\n\r\n[2425] See B. xxiv. c. 61.\r\n\r\n[2426] “Nerion” is the Greek name.\r\n\r\n[2427] It has certain dangerous properties, which cause the herbivorous\r\nanimals to avoid touching it. It acts strongly on the muscular system,\r\nand, as Fée remarks, used as an antidote to the stings of serpents, it\r\nis not improbable that its effect would be the worst of the two.\r\n\r\n[2428] See B. xiii. c. 37. The tamarisk of the moderns is not an\r\nevergreen, which has caused writers to doubt if it is identical with\r\nthe tamariscus of the ancients, and to be disposed to look for it among\r\nthe larger ericæ or heaths. The leaves of the larch fall every year;\r\nthose of the other evergreens mostly every two or three years.\r\n\r\n[2429] See B. xiii. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[2430] See B. xiii. c. 40. This assertion of Pliny is erroneous, as\r\nthese trees are in reality evergreens, though all trees of that class\r\nare liable to lose their leaves through certain maladies.\r\n\r\n[2431] “Quercus.” The ilex or holm-oak is an evergreen.\r\n\r\n[2432] Pliny is in error here. Varro, De Re Rust. B. i. c. 7, has made\r\nmention of this tree.\r\n\r\n[2433] The hot climates possess a greater number of evergreens than\r\nthe temperate regions, but not of the same species or genus. The vine\r\ninvariably loses its leaves each year.\r\n\r\n[2434] This last assertion, Fée says, is far from true, in relation to\r\nthe coniferous trees.\r\n\r\n[2435] See B. xv. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2436] The Populus alba of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2437] The Populus nigra of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2438] The Populus tremula of Linnæus. This statement as to the leaves\r\nof the poplar is verified by modern experience.\r\n\r\n[2439] This does not appear to be exactly correct as to the ivy.\r\nThe leaves on the young suckers or the old and sterile branches are\r\ndivided into three or five regular lobes, while those which grow on the\r\nbranches destined to bear the blossoms are ovals or lanceolated ovals\r\nin shape.\r\n\r\n[2440] It is not from the leaves, but from the fruit of the tree that\r\nthis down falls; the seeds being enveloped with a cottony substance.\r\nThis passage is hopelessly corrupt.\r\n\r\n[2441] See B. xviii. c. 68, where he enlarges still further on this\r\nasserted peculiarity; he borrows his statement from Theophrastus, Hist.\r\nPlant. B. i. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[2442] These statements are quite conformable with the fact.\r\n\r\n[2443] This statement is quite true, so far as the fact that the leaves\r\nhave not the same position in the day-time as during the night: the\r\nchanges of position vary greatly, however, in the different kinds. It\r\nis generally thought that an organic irritability is the cause of this\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\n[2444] This seems to be the meaning of “In aliis gentium lana est.”\r\nHe alludes, probably, to cotton or silk: see B. vi. c. 20. Thunberg\r\ntells us that at Roodesand, near the Cape of Good Hope, there grows so\r\nthick a down on the Buplevrum giganteum of Lamarck, that it is employed\r\nto imitate a sort of white velvet, and is used for bonnets, gloves,\r\nstockings, &c.\r\n\r\n[2445] B. xiii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2446] “Genere ilicum.” It is not improbable that he here refers to the\r\nvariety of the holm-oak which he has previously called “aquifolia,”\r\napparently confounding it with the holly. See c. 8 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2447] See B. xiii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[2448] This must be understood of the young leaf of the alder, which\r\nhas a sort of thick gummy varnish on it.\r\n\r\n[2449] B. xiii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2450] B. xv. c. 15. Pliny is not correct here; the leaf of the pear\r\nis oval or lanceolated, while that of the apple is oval and somewhat\r\nangular, though not exactly “mucronata,” or sharply pointed.\r\n\r\n[2451] Not exactly “divided,” but strongly lobed.\r\n\r\n[2452] If this is the case, the pitch-tree can hardly be identical with\r\nthe false fir, the Abies excelsa of Decandolles. See c. 18 of this\r\nBook, and the Note.\r\n\r\n[2453] This passage would be apt to mislead, did we not know that the\r\nleaves of the coniferous trees here mentioned are not prickly, in the\r\nsame sense as those of the holly, which are armed with very formidable\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\n[2454] More particularly in the Populus tremula, the “quivering” poplar.\r\n\r\n[2455] Crepitantia.\r\n\r\n[2456] See B. xv. c. 15. Not a species, but an accidental monstrosity.\r\n\r\n[2457] See B. xv. c. 37, where he speaks of the Hexastich myrtle.\r\n\r\n[2458] The leaves of the elm and the tree supposed to be identical with\r\nthe cytisus of the ancients have no characteristics in common. See B.\r\nxiii. c. 47, and the Notes.\r\n\r\n[2459] De Re Rust. cc. 5, 30, 45.\r\n\r\n[2460] Very inappropriate food for cattle, it would appear: the fig\r\nleaf being charged with a corrosive milky juice; the leaf of the holm\r\noak, hard and leathery; and that of the ivy, bitter and nauseous in the\r\nhighest degree.\r\n\r\n[2461] Eighth of February.\r\n\r\n[2462] See B. viii. c. 67.\r\n\r\n[2463] Catlitio.\r\n\r\n[2464] He alludes to the period of the rising of the sap; an entirely\r\ndistinct process from germination.\r\n\r\n[2465] This statement, as also that relative to the holm oak, and other\r\ntrees previously mentioned, is quite incorrect. The blossoms of the\r\nfig-tree are very much concealed, however, from view in the involucre\r\nof the clinanthium.\r\n\r\n[2466] This is not the fact, though the blossom of the juniper is of\r\nhumble character, and not easily seen. Theophrastus, B. iii. c. 6, only\r\nsays that it is a matter of doubt, what Pliny so positively affirms.\r\n\r\n[2467] This is the fact; the male tree is sterile, but it fecundates\r\nthe female.\r\n\r\n[2468] These remarks, borrowed from Theophrastus, are generally\r\nconsistent with our experience.\r\n\r\n[2469] Fée remarks that Pliny here copies from Theophrastus, a writer\r\nof Greece, without making allowance for the difference of localities.\r\nTheophrastus, however, gives the laurel an earlier period for budding\r\nthan Pliny does.\r\n\r\n[2470] The Rhamnus paliurus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2471] This is entirely fanciful: though it is the case that in some\r\ntrees, the ligneous ones, namely, there are two germinations in the\r\nyear, one at the beginning of spring, which acts more particularly on\r\nthe branches, and the other at the end of summer, which acts more upon\r\nthe parts nearer the roots.\r\n\r\n[2472] See B. xviii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[2473] There is no such thing as a third budding.\r\n\r\n[2474] As already stated, there are never more than two germinations.\r\n\r\n[2475] This rupture of the epidermis, caused by the formation beneath\r\nof new ligneous and conical layers, takes place not solely, as Pliny\r\nand Theophrastus state, at the time of germination, but slowly and\r\ncontinuously.\r\n\r\n[2476] On the contrary, they are irregular both in their commencement\r\nand their duration.\r\n\r\n[2477] This is not the case; each bud is independent of the one that\r\nhas preceded it. A sucker, however, newly developed may give birth to\r\nbuds not at the extremity, but throughout the whole length of it.\r\n\r\n[2478] See B. xviii. c. 67. What Pliny says here is in general true,\r\nthough its germination does not take place with such rapidity as he\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n[2479] A mere fable, of course.\r\n\r\n[2480] In the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2481] In Paris, Fée says, the almond does not blossom till March. If\r\nthe tree should blossom too soon, it is often at the expense of the\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n[2482] Probably the apricot. See B. xv. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[2483] See B. xv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2484] See B. xxiv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2485] This, of course, is not the fact. As to the succeeding\r\nstatements, they are borrowed mostly from Theophrastus, and are in\r\ngeneral correct.\r\n\r\n[2486] The rising of the sap.\r\n\r\n[2487] The Pleiades. See B. xviii. cc. 59, 60.\r\n\r\n[2488] It was supposed in astrology that the stars exercised an effect\r\nequally upon animal and vegetable life.\r\n\r\n[2489] 25th of July.\r\n\r\n[2490] See B. xviii. c. 68.\r\n\r\n[2491] The Cornus mas of botanists; probably the Frutex sanguineus\r\nmentioned in c. 30. See also B. xv. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[2492] Probably the Lonicera Alpigena of Linnæus; the fruit of which\r\nresembles a cherry, but is of a sour flavour, and produces vomiting.\r\n\r\n[2493] The wood is so durable, that a tree of this kind in the forest\r\nof Montmorency is said to be a thousand years old.\r\n\r\n[2494] See B. xviii. cc. 59, 60.\r\n\r\n[2495] See c. 6 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2496] See B. xii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2497] This supposed marvel merely arises from the fact that the fruit\r\nhas a strong ligneous stalk, which almost precludes the possibility of\r\nits dropping off. This is the case, too, not only with the pine, but\r\nwith numerous other trees as well.\r\n\r\n[2498] “Dried” nuts.\r\n\r\n[2499] See B. xxiv. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[2500] But in B. xxiv. c. 32, he speaks of the fruit of the black\r\npoplar as an antidote for epilepsy. In fact, he is quite in error in\r\ndenying a seed to any of these trees.\r\n\r\n[2501] See c. 29 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2502] The Rhamnus alaternus of Linnæus, the Phylica elatior of\r\nC. Bauhin. In reality, it bears a small black berry, of purgative\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n[2503] “Infelices,” “unhappy” rather.\r\n\r\n[2504] Daughter of Sithon, king of Thrace, who hanged herself on\r\naccount of the supposed inconstancy of her lover, Demophöon. See Ovid,\r\nHeroid. 2.\r\n\r\n[2505] This must not be taken to the letter; indeed, Fée thinks that\r\nthe proper meaning is:—“Young trees do not produce fruit till they have\r\narrived at a certain state of maturity.” Trees mostly continue on the\r\nincrease till they die.\r\n\r\n[2506] See B. xvii. c. 2. The assertion here made has not been\r\nconfirmed by experience.\r\n\r\n[2507] “Frugiperda:” in the Greek, ὠλεσίκαρπον. See Homer. Od. x. l.\r\n510. It has been suggested, Pliny says, that the willow seed had this\r\nepithet from its effect in causing abortion; but he does not seem to\r\nshare the opinion.\r\n\r\n[2508] This cannot be a willow, Fée remarks; indeed, Theophrastus, B.\r\niii. c. 5, speaks of a black poplar as growing there.\r\n\r\n[2509] See B. xv. c. 13. It is not impossible that Pliny may have\r\nmistaken here the Persea, or Balanites Ægyptiaca, for the Persica, or\r\npeach. See p. 296.\r\n\r\n[2510] Fée remarks, that this expression is remarkable as giving a just\r\nnotion of the relative functions of the male and female in plants. He\r\nsays that one might almost be tempted to believe that they suspected\r\nsomething of the nature and functions of the pistils and stamens.\r\n\r\n[2511] This statement, which is drawn from Theophrastus, is rather\r\nfanciful than rigorously true.\r\n\r\n[2512] B. xiii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2513] Or “forerunner.” The Spaniards call a similar fig “brevas,” the\r\n“ready ripener.”\r\n\r\n[2514] See B. xv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2515] See B. xv. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2516] This does not happen in the northern climates; though sometimes\r\nit is the case that a fruit-tree blossoms again towards the end of\r\nsummer, and if the autumn is fine and prolonged, these late fruits will\r\nripen. Such a phenomenon, however, is of very rare occurrence.\r\n\r\n[2517] See B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2518] “Insanæ.” There are some varieties of the vine which blossom\r\nmore than once, and bear green grapes and fully ripe ones at the same\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n[2519] De Re Rust. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2520] The suggested reading, “apud matrem magnam,” seems preferable to\r\n“apud mare,” and receives support from what is said relative to Smyrna\r\nin B. xiv. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[2521] See B. v. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2522] B. xviii. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[2523] B. xv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2524] This is not the fact: the fruits of all trees have their proper\r\ntime for ripening.\r\n\r\n[2525] He speaks here in too general terms; the pear, for instance, is\r\nnot more fruitful when old than when young.\r\n\r\n[2526] He speaks of the process of caprification. See B. xv. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2527] So our proverb, “Soon ripe, soon rotten;” applicable to mankind\r\nas well as trees. See B. xxiii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[2528] See B. xv. c. 27. The mulberry tree will live for several\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n[2529] This stimulates the sap, and adds to its activity: but the tree\r\ngrows old all the sooner, being the more speedily exhausted.\r\n\r\n[2530] In cc. 9-14 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2531] This passage is quite unintelligible; and it is with good reason\r\nthat Fée questions whether Pliny really understood the author that he\r\ncopied from.\r\n\r\n[2532] Fée remarks, that Pliny does not seem to know that the catkin is\r\nan assemblage of flowers, and that without it the tree would be totally\r\nbarren.\r\n\r\n[2533] Pliny blunders sadly here, in copying from Theophrastus, B.\r\niii. c. 16. He mixes up a description of the box and the cratægus, or\r\nholm-oak, making the latter to be a seed of the former: and he then\r\nattributes a mistletoe to the box, which Theophrastus speaks of as\r\ngrowing on the cratægus.\r\n\r\n[2534] See c. 93, where he enlarges on the varieties of the mistletoe.\r\n\r\n[2535] See B. xxiv. c. 71.\r\n\r\n[2536] He means the garden or border-box, mentioned in c. 28 of this\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[2537] See B. xiii. c. 17: the African lotus, probably; the Zizyphus\r\nlotus of Desfontaines.\r\n\r\n[2538] This statement is entirely incorrect. If a tree loses the\r\nterminal bud, it will grow no higher; but it will not die if the\r\nextremities of the branches are cut. Such, in fact, is much more likely\r\nto happen when they are all cut off, from the extreme loss of juices\r\nwhich must naturally ensue at the several cicatrices united.\r\n\r\n[2539] The Celtis australis of Linnæus. Pliny is in error in calling\r\nthis tree the “Grecian bean.” In B. xiii. c. 22, he erroneously calls\r\nthe African lotus by the name of “celtis,” which only belongs to the\r\nlotus of Italy; that of Africa being altogether different.\r\n\r\n[2540] The bark, which is astringent, is still used in preparing skins,\r\nand a black colouring matter extracted from the root is employed in\r\ndyeing wool.\r\n\r\n[2541] Quite an accidental resemblance, if, indeed, it ever existed.\r\n\r\n[2542] “Oculus”—the bud on the trunk.\r\n\r\n[2543] This must be either a mistake or an exaggeration; the cherry\r\nnever being a very large tree.\r\n\r\n[2544] It is evident that he is speaking of the epidermis only, and not\r\nthe cortical layers and the liber.\r\n\r\n[2545] The roots of trees being ligneous, “carnosæ,” Fée remarks, is an\r\ninappropriate term.\r\n\r\n[2546] Georg. ii. 291.\r\n\r\n[2547] “Lagenas.” Fée takes this to mean here vessels to hold liquids,\r\nand remarks that the workers in wicker cannot attain this degree of\r\nperfection at the present day.\r\n\r\n[2548] Pliny is in error in rejecting this notion.\r\n\r\n[2549] See B. xii. c. 5, and B. xiii. c. 29. What Pliny states of the\r\nfir, or Abies pectinata, Theophrastus relates of the πεύκη, or Abies\r\nexcelsa of Decandolles. There is little doubt that in either case the\r\nstatement is incorrect.\r\n\r\n[2550] On the contrary, the roots of trees increase in size till the\r\nperiod of their death.\r\n\r\n[2551] By preventing the action of the air from drying the roots, and\r\nso killing the tree.\r\n\r\n[2552] A grove, probably, consecrated to the Muses.\r\n\r\n[2553] These stories must be regarded as either fables or impostures;\r\nthough it is very possible for a tree to survive after the epidermis\r\nhas been removed with the adze.\r\n\r\n[2554] See B. xvii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2555] In c. 7 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2556] It is not improbable that he has in view here the passage in\r\nVirgil’s Georgics, B. ii. l. 109, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2557] Or balm of Gilead. See B. xii. c. 54. Bruce assures us that it\r\nis indigenous to Abyssinia; if so, it has been transplanted in Arabia.\r\nIt is no more to be found in Judæa.\r\n\r\n[2558] This is inserted, as it is evident that the text without it is\r\nimperfect. Fée says that even in Judæa it was transplanted from Arabia.\r\n\r\n[2559] As to the identification of the cinnamomum of Pliny,\r\nsee B. xii. cc. 41 and 42, and the Notes.\r\n\r\n[2560] As to the question of the identity of the amomum, see B. xii. c.\r\n28.\r\n\r\n[2561] See B. xii. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[2562] This cannot be the ordinary Piper nigrum, or black pepper, which\r\ndoes not deserve the title “arbor.” It is, no doubt, the pepper of\r\nItaly, which he mentions in B. xii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[2563] The Cassia Italica, probably, of B. xii. c. 43. The cassia of\r\nthe East could not possibly survive in Italy. The fact is, no doubt,\r\nthat the Romans gave the names of cassia, piper, and amomum, to certain\r\nindigenous plants, and then persuaded themselves that they had the\r\ngenuine plants of the East.\r\n\r\n[2564] See B. xii. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[2565] Under the name of Cedrus, no doubt, several of the junipers have\r\nbeen included. See B. xiii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2566] Fée is inclined to doubt this statement. The myrtle has been\r\nknown to stand the winters of Lower Brittany.\r\n\r\n[2567] Owing, no doubt, as Fée says, solely to bad methods of\r\ncultivation. The same, too, with the grafted peach and the Greek nut or\r\nalmond.\r\n\r\n[2568] The Cupressus sempervirens of Linnæus, the Cupressus fastigiata\r\nof Decandolle.\r\n\r\n[2569] De Re Rust. cc. 48, 151.\r\n\r\n[2570] “Morosa;” meaning that it reaches maturity but very slowly.\r\n\r\n[2571] Tristis tentantum sensu torquebit amaror.—Virg. Georg. ii. 247.\r\n\r\n[2572] This statement is exaggerated.\r\n\r\n[2573] It is still to be seen very frequently in the cemeteries of\r\nGreece and Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[2574] The cypress is in reality monœcious, the structure of the same\r\nplant being both male and female.\r\n\r\n[2575] This was formerly done with the cypress, in England, to a\r\nconsiderable extent. Such absurdities are now but rare.\r\n\r\n[2576] The Cupressus fastigiata of Decandolle: and a variety of the\r\nCupressus sempervirens of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2577] The Cupressus horizontalis of Miller; the variety B of the C.\r\nsempervirens of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2578] The present name given to this tree in the island of Crete, is\r\nthe “daughter’s dowry.”\r\n\r\n[2579] De Re Rust. c. 151.\r\n\r\n[2580] B. iii. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[2581] This, Fée says, is the case with none of the coniferous trees.\r\n\r\n[2582] Of course this spontaneous creation of the cypress is fabulous;\r\nand, indeed, the whole account, which is borrowed from Theophrastus, is\r\ngreatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\n[2583] B. xix. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[2584] This story, which is borrowed from Theophrastus, is evidently\r\nfabulous.\r\n\r\n[2585] Meaning Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[2586] Hist.

Its tendrils fasten upon the cortical fissures; and, if the tree\r\nis but small, its development is apt to be retarded thereby. It is\r\nbeneficial, rather than destructive, to walls.\r\n\r\n[2590] This plant is really monœcious or androgynous.\r\n\r\n[2591] The Rosa Eglanteria.\r\n\r\n[2592] The Hedera helix of Linnæus, or, possibly, a variety of it with\r\nvariegated leaves.\r\n\r\n[2593] The Hedera arborea of C.

Bauhin.\r\n\r\n[2600] This is the case sometimes with the black ivy, the Hedera\r\narborea of C. Bauhin. Only isolated cases, however, are to be met with.\r\n\r\n[2601] There is an ivy of this kind, the Hedera humi repens of\r\nbotanists; but most of the commentators are of opinion that it is the\r\nground ivy, the Glechoma hederacea of Linnæus, that is spoken of.\r\nSprengel takes it to be the Anthirrinum Azarina, from which opinion,\r\nhowever, Fée dissents.\r\n\r\n[2602] The Smilax aspera of Linnæus; the sarsaparilla plant.\r\n\r\n[2603] Fée is inclined to question this; but the breadth of the tablets\r\nmay have been very small in this instance.\r\n\r\n[2604] Of course this is fabulous: though it is not impossible that\r\nthe writing on the tablets may sometimes have caused “a noise in the\r\nworld,” and that hence the poets may have given rise to this story.\r\n\r\n[2605] Pliny borrows this fabulous story from Cato, De Re Rust. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2606] The reeds cannot be appropriately ranked among the shrubs.\r\n\r\n[2607] For musical purposes, namely.\r\n\r\n[2608] B. v. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[2609] “Calamus.” The so-called reed of the East, used for making darts\r\nand arrows, does not belong to the genus Arundo, but to those of the\r\nBambos and Nastus.\r\n\r\n[2610] Few readers of history will fail to recollect the report made to\r\nKing Henry V. by Davy Gam, before the battle of Agincourt:—“The enemy\r\nare so numerous,” said the messenger, “that their arrows will darken\r\nthe sun.” “We must e’en be content to fight in the dark then,” was the\r\nwarrior’s reply.\r\n\r\n[2611] See B. vii. c. 2. This is probably an exaggeration. He alludes\r\nto the Bambos arundinacea of Lamarck, the Arundo arbor of C. Bauhin.\r\n\r\n[2612] The Arundo donax of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2613] Or the pipe-reed.\r\n\r\n[2614] The tibia, or pipe, was played lengthwise, like the flageolet or\r\nclarionet.\r\n\r\n[2615] A variety of the Arundo donax. The Orchomenian reed is of the\r\nsame class.

The Arundo donax, probably, so far as\r\nEuropean warfare was concerned.\r\n\r\n[2617] A variety of the Arundo donax of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2618] This is not the fact.\r\n\r\n[2619] The Arundo versicolor of Miller.\r\n\r\n[2620] Constantinus and Schneider, upon Theophrastus, Hist.

The Plotias, no doubt, was\r\nonly a variety of it.\r\n\r\n[2623] “Arundo tibialis.” The story about the time taken by it to grow,\r\nand the increase of the waters, is, of course, fabulous.\r\n\r\n[2624] The “yoke reed,” or “reed for a double flute.”\r\n\r\n[2625] Perhaps so called from the silkiness of its flossy pinicules.\r\n\r\n[2626] This seems to be the meaning of “ad inclusos cantus.”\r\n\r\n[2627] B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2628] Lingulis.\r\n\r\n[2629] The words “dextræ” and “sinistræ,” denote the treble and the\r\nbass flutes; it is thought by some, because the former were held with\r\nthe right hand, and the latter with the left. Two treble or bass flutes\r\nwere occasionally played on at the same time.\r\n\r\n[2630] See B. xiii. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[2631] These were of the variety Zeugites, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2632] Fée suggests, that what he mentions here may not have been a\r\nreed at all, but one of the cyperaceous plants, the papyrus, perhaps.\r\n\r\n[2633] De Re Rust. c. 6. It was the donax that was thus employed; as it\r\nis in France at the present day.\r\n\r\n[2634] Oculis.

Fée remarks that the notions of modern\r\nagriculturists are very different on this point.\r\n\r\n[2641] The Salix purpurea of Linnæus: the Salix vulgaris rubens of C.\r\nBauhin.\r\n\r\n[2642] This belongs, probably, to the Salix helix of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2643] Fée queries whether this may not be the Salix incana of Schrank\r\nand Hoffmann, the bark of which is a brown green.\r\n\r\n[2644] Belonging to the Salix helix of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2645] Belonging to the Salix purpurea of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2646] Field-mouse or squirrel colour. See B. viii. c. 82. The same,\r\nprobably, as the Salix vitellina of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2647] A variety, Fée thinks, of the Salix rubens.\r\n\r\n[2648] The Scirpus lacustris of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2649] And not in front of them.\r\n\r\n[2650] Mapalia.\r\n\r\n[2651] Egypt, namely.\r\n\r\n[2652] The bramble is sometimes found on the banks of watery spots and\r\nin marshy localities, but more frequently in mountainous and arid spots.\r\n\r\n[2653] Known to us as blackberries. This tree is the Rubus fruticosus\r\nof Linnæus; the same as the Rubus tomentosus, and the Rubus\r\ncorylifolius of other modern botanists.\r\n\r\n[2654] The Rosa canina of Linnæus: the dog-rose or Eglantine.\r\n\r\n[2655] The Rubus Idæus of botanists; the ordinary raspberry.\r\n\r\n[2656] See B. xxiv. c. 75.\r\n\r\n[2657] See B. xxiv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[2658] They are still used for dyeing, but not for staining the hair.\r\n\r\n[2659] Only as a purgative, probably.\r\n\r\n[2660] Though the acid it contains would curdle milk, still its natural\r\nacridity would disqualify it from being used for making cheese.\r\n\r\n[2661] The white sap or inner bark; the aubier of the French. Fée\r\nremarks, that its supposed analogy with fat is incorrect.\r\n\r\n[2662] He means the outer ligneous layers of the wood. They differ only\r\nin their relative hardness.\r\n\r\n[2663] “Pulpæ.” The ligneous fibres which form the tissue of the bark.\r\n\r\n[2664] “Venæ.” By this term he probably means the nutritive vessels and\r\nthe ligneous fibres united. It was anciently the general belief that\r\nthe fibres acted their part in the nutriment of the tree.\r\n\r\n[2665] “Graphium.” Properly a stylus or iron pen.\r\n\r\n[2666] “Glandia.” This analogy, Fée remarks, does not hold good.\r\n\r\n[2667] See B. xiii. c. 29, and c. 27 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2668] And at an angle with the grain or fibre of the wood.\r\n\r\n[2669] And at right angles. In the Dicotyledons, the disposition of the\r\nfibres is longitudinal and transversal.\r\n\r\n[2670] Guttum.\r\n\r\n[2671] For the simple reason, because the part near the root is of\r\ngreater diameter.\r\n\r\n[2672] Soft ligneous layers.\r\n\r\n[2673] In c. 72 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2674] Hard wood—such as we know generally as “heart;” “heart of oak”\r\nfor instance.\r\n\r\n[2675] Probably that of the ligneous layers near the pith or sap.\r\n\r\n[2676] “Limo:” the alburnum previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2677] This practice was formerly forbidden by the forest laws of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[2678] In B. xviii.\r\n\r\n[2679] Pliny borrows this superstition from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant.\r\nB. vi. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[2680] This was the name of mimic sea-fights, exhibited at Rome in\r\nthe Circus or amphitheatres, or else in lakes dug expressly for the\r\npurpose. Hardouin says, there were five Naumachiæ at Rome, in the 14th\r\nregion of the City.\r\n\r\n[2681] This practice is no longer followed.\r\n\r\n[2682] De Re Rust. c. 31; also cc. 17 and 37.\r\n\r\n[2683] This practice is observed in modern times.\r\n\r\n[2684] C. 37.\r\n\r\n[2685] Pliny, no doubt, observes an analogy between the hair of\r\nthe human head, and trees as forming the hair of the earth. The\r\nsuperstition here mentioned, Fée says, was, till very recently,\r\nobserved in France to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\n[2686] De Re Rust. 1, 37.\r\n\r\n[2687] Terebinthine or turpentine.\r\n\r\n[2688] “Ad fabrorum intestina opera medulla sectilis.” This passage is\r\nprobably corrupt.\r\n\r\n[2689] In c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2690] With reference to the fir, namely.\r\n\r\n[2691] B. iii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[2692] B. iv. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2693] An additional proof, perhaps, that the cedar of the ancients\r\nis only one of the junipers, and that, as Fée says, they were not\r\nacquainted with the real cedar.\r\n\r\n[2694] B. iii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2695] “Spiras.” It seems to have been the opinion of the ancients that\r\nthe internal knots of the wood are formed spirally. Such is not the\r\nfact, as they consist of independent layers.\r\n\r\n[2696] Centra.\r\n\r\n[2697] He takes this account from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. v. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2698] The greatest height, Fée says, of any tree known, is that of the\r\npalm, known as ceroxylon; it sometimes attains a height of 250 feet.\r\nAdanson speaks of the baobab as being 90 feet in circumference.\r\n\r\n[2699] In c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2700] See B. xix. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[2701] A spot enclosed in the Campus Martius, for the resort of the\r\npeople during the Comitia, and when giving their votes.\r\n\r\n[2702] “Diribitorium.” This was the place, probably, where the\r\ndiribitores distributed to the citizens the tabellæ, with which they\r\nvoted in the Comitia, or else, as Wunder thinks, divided the votes,\r\nacting as “tellers,” in the modern phrase.\r\n\r\n[2703] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[2704] B. xxxvi. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[2705] See B. xxxvi. c. 14. This was a mortar made of volcanic ashes,\r\nwhich hardened under water. It is now known as Pozzuolane.\r\n\r\n[2706] The Pinus cedrus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2707] The canoes were formed probably of the fir.\r\n\r\n[2708] The Celtis australis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2709] See B. xiii. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[2710] This, Fée says, is not the case, if the Syrian terebinth is the\r\nsame as the Pistacia terebinthus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2711] This is not the case; a nail has a firm hold in all resinous\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n[2712] This is evidently a puerile absurdity: but it is borrowed from\r\nTheophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. v. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2713] The savages of North America, and, indeed, of all parts of the\r\nglobe, seem to have been acquainted with this method of kindling fire\r\nfrom the very earliest times.\r\n\r\n[2714] See B. xxiv. c. 49. The Viticella, belonging to the genus\r\nclematis.\r\n\r\n[2715] This unfounded notion is borrowed from Theophrastus, B. v. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2716] In the modern botanical sense of the word, the male trees do not\r\nbear at all.\r\n\r\n[2717] Asia Minor, namely. See B. xxxv. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2718] The junctures where the pieces of wood are united by glue. This\r\nis to be observed very easily in the greater part of the oaken statuary\r\nthat is so plentiful in the churches of Belgium.\r\n\r\n[2719] Cypress is perhaps the most lasting of all woods.\r\n\r\n[2720] One of the earliest appellations, probably, of Jupiter among the\r\nRomans. See Ovid’s Fasti, B. iii. l. 445, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2721] This is correct. Their resin defends them from the\r\naction of the air, from damp, and the attacks of noxious insects.\r\n\r\n[2722] A variety of the oak. See c. 6 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2723] As mentioned at the end of c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2724] See B. xi. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2725] See B. xvii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[2726] In c. 74.\r\n\r\n[2727] There is nothing very surprising in this, as most woods are\r\npreserved better when completely immersed in water, than when exposed\r\nto the variations of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[2728] He borrows this fable from Theophrastus, B. v. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[2729] This process, Fée says, would be attended with no success.\r\n\r\n[2730] It is not quite clear whether he intends this observation to\r\napply to the poplar and the palm, or to the last only. It is true,\r\nhowever, in neither case, and is contrary, as Fée observes, to all\r\nphysical laws.\r\n\r\n[2731] The resistance that woods offer when placed vertically is in the\r\nsame ratio as that presented by them when employed horizontally. This\r\nparagraph is borrowed from Theophrastus, B. iii. c. 4, and B. v. cc. 6,\r\n7, 8.\r\n\r\n[2732] Ferula.\r\n\r\n[2733] In c. 77.\r\n\r\n[2734] See c. 24.\r\n\r\n[2735] Fée thinks, from the context, that the meaning is, that the vine\r\nwas employed in the construction of chariots; it depends entirely on\r\nthe punctuation adopted.\r\n\r\n[2736] This could only have happened in the first year that they were\r\nso employed.\r\n\r\n[2737] De Re Rust. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[2738] It is singular, Fée says, to find the wood of the palm, and that\r\nof the poplar, which are destitute of veins, enumerated among those\r\nemployed for veneering.\r\n\r\n[2739] In c. 27.\r\n\r\n[2740] According to Adanson, the baobab will live for more than six\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\n[2741] The Celtis australis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2742] In consequence of the disputes between the patricians and\r\nplebeians.\r\n\r\n[2743] Thus deriving Lucina from “lucus,” a grove.\r\n\r\n[2744] Capillos.\r\n\r\n[2745] An area before the temple of Vulcan.\r\n\r\n[2746] “Stationes municipiorum.” A sort of exchange, near the Forum,\r\nwhere the citizens met to discuss the topics of the day.\r\n\r\n[2747] See B. iv. c. 18. Of course, this story must be regarded as\r\nfabulous.\r\n\r\n[2748] Quercus.\r\n\r\n[2749] These are fables founded upon the known longevity of trees,\r\nwhich, as Fée remarks, Pliny relates with a truly “infantine\r\nsimplicity.”\r\n\r\n[2750] See B. v. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[2751] See B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2752] The palm is by no means a long-lived tree.\r\n\r\n[2753] The pomegranate, on the contrary, has been known to live many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n[2754] He has elsewhere said that the vine is extremely long-lived.\r\n\r\n[2755] In the last Chapter he has spoken of a laurel having existed for\r\nmany centuries.\r\n\r\n[2756] To its great detriment, probably.\r\n\r\n[2757] Fée says that no holm-oak is ever known to attain this size.\r\n\r\n[2758] See c. 62.\r\n\r\n[2759] Sprengel says that this is the parasitic plant, which he calls\r\nCassyta filiformis. Fée says that this opinion, though perhaps not to\r\nbe absolutely rejected, must be accepted with reserve.\r\n\r\n[2760] It does not seem to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[2761] See B. xviii. c. 33.\r\n\r\n[2762] Serpyllum. See B. xx. c. 90.\r\n\r\n[2763] A mistletoe, apparently, growing upon the wild olive. Fée says\r\nthat no such viscus appears to be known.\r\n\r\n[2764] See B. xxvii. c. 66. The Calcitrapa stellata of Lamarck. Fée\r\nremarks that Pliny has committed a great error, in making it a parasite\r\nof the Spina fullonia. Dioscorides only says that the two plants grow\r\nin the same spots.\r\n\r\n[2765] The Viscum Europæum of modern naturalists.\r\n\r\n[2766] The Viscum album of Linnæus; but Sprengel takes it to be the\r\nLoranthus Europæus.\r\n\r\n[2767] Fée questions whether this may not be the Loranthus Europæus.\r\n\r\n[2768] The Viscum album of Linnæus; the oak mistletoe or real mistletoe.\r\n\r\n[2769] This is not the fact: it grows upon a vast multitude of other\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n[2770] It is no longer used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[2771] The mistletoe never in any case loses its leaves, upon whatever\r\ntree it may grow.\r\n\r\n[2772] This is, of course, untrue; but the seeds, after being voided by\r\nbirds, are more likely to adhere to the bark of trees, and so find a\r\nnidus for germination.\r\n\r\n[2773] The exact opposite is the case, the female being the fruitful\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n[2774] The method used in Italy for making bird-lime is very similar at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\n[2775] Magos.\r\n\r\n[2776] Decandolle was of opinion, that the mistletoe of the\r\nDruids was not a viscum, but the Loranthus Europæus, which is much more\r\ncommonly found on oaks.\r\n\r\n[2777] Δρῦς, an “oak.” It is much more probable that it was of Celtic\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n[2778] Omnia sanantem.\r\n\r\n[2779] “Sagum.” Properly, a “military cloak.”\r\n\r\n[2780] It was, in comparatively recent times, supposed to be\r\nefficacious for epilepsy.\r\n\r\n[2781] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2782] Author of a History or Annals of Rome.

Vitruvius Pollio, an eminent architect, employed by Augustus.\r\nHis valuable work on architecture is still extant.\r\n\r\n[2796] See end of B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[2797] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2798] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2799] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2800] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2801] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2802] He alludes to the various shrubs and trees, mentioned\r\nas growing in the sea, B. xiii. c. 48; but which there is little doubt,\r\nin reality belong to the class of fuci.\r\n\r\n[2803] “Fiunt verius quam nascuntur;” a distinction\r\nperpetuated in the adage, “Poeta nascitur, non fit.”\r\n\r\n[2804] He probably alludes to his remark in B. xvi. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[2805] Q. Luctatius Catulus, the colleague of Marius. Being afterwards\r\ncondemned to die by Marius, he suffocated himself with the fumes of\r\ncharcoal.\r\n\r\n[2806] A.U.C. 659.\r\n\r\n[2807] Valerius Maximus, B. ix. c. 1, relates this story somewhat\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\n[2808] The Celtis Australis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2809] See B. xxxvi. cc. 3 and 24.\r\n\r\n[2810] When, in his capacity of ædile, he gave theatrical\r\nrepresentations for the benefit of the public.\r\n\r\n[2811] As Fée remarks, this usage has been reversed in modern times,\r\nand plants often receive their botanical names from men.\r\n\r\n[2812] See B. xviii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2813] Or north north-east, as Fée says. He adds that this aspect in\r\nreality is not favourable to vegetation. Pliny commits the error of\r\ncopying _exactly_ from Theophrastus, and thereby giving advice to Roman\r\nagriculturists, which was properly suited to the climate of Greece only.\r\n\r\n[2814] This is borrowed from Theophrastus; but, as Fée remarks, if\r\nsuitable to the climate of Greece, it is not so to that of Italy or\r\nFrance, where vegetation is much more promoted by a south wind.\r\n\r\n[2815] This assertion, Fée says, is erroneous. See B. xvi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[2816] B. xviii. c. 66.\r\n\r\n[2817] See c. 30 of this Book. These notions as to critical periods\r\nto plants connected with the constellations, Fée says, are now almost\r\ndispelled; though they still prevail in France, to some extent.\r\n\r\n[2818] “Coitus.” See B. xvi. cc. 39 and 42.\r\n\r\n[2819] See B. xvi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[2820] From Theophrastus, De Causis, B. ii. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[2821] He alludes to the words of Virgil, Georg. i. 100:—\r\n\r\n  “Humida solstitia, atque hiemes orate serenas,\r\n  Agricolæ; hiberno lætissima pulvere farra.”\r\n\r\nFée remarks, that the cultivators of the modern times are more of the\r\nopinion of the poet than the naturalist.\r\n\r\n[2822] Because rains would cause the young fruit to fall off. He here\r\nattacks the first portion of the precepts of Virgil; but only, it\r\nappears, in reference to the vine.\r\n\r\n[2823] “Lactescentibus.” Fée remarks on the appropriateness of this\r\nexpression, as the act of germination, he says, in the cereals and all\r\nthe seeds in which the perisperm is feculent, changes the fecula into\r\nan emulsive liquid, in which state the seed may be said, with Pliny, to\r\nbe “lactescent.”\r\n\r\n[2824] Which appears to have been extensively done with the young\r\ngarden trees.\r\n\r\n[2825] Georg. ii. 398.\r\n\r\n[2826] Taken altogether, a southern aspect is preferable to all others.\r\n\r\n[2827] See B. ii. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[2828] Cc. 46 and 47.\r\n\r\n[2829] He seems to lose sight of the fact that they _bud_ before those\r\nthat look to the north.\r\n\r\n[2830] B. xvi. cc. 30, 31.\r\n\r\n[2831] A rich black mould, probably.\r\n\r\n[2832] A ferruginous argilla.\r\n\r\n[2833] It must of necessity denote a soil rich in humus, though not, of\r\ncourse, adapted for all kinds of cultivation.\r\n\r\n[2834] He alludes to the difficulty with which argilla, from its\r\ntenacity, is employed in cultivation.\r\n\r\n[2835] Columella says the contrary, and so does Virgil, Georg. ii.\r\n226, speaking of this fact as a method of ascertaining the respective\r\nqualities of the earth.\r\n\r\n[2836] Virgil, Georg. ii. 220, says the contrary.\r\n\r\n[2837] In allusion to what Virgil says, Georg. ii. 254:—\r\n\r\n  “Quæ gravis est, ipso tacitam se pondere prodit,\r\n    Quæque levis——”\r\n\r\nFée remarks, however, that it is easy enough to analyse the earth, and\r\nascertain the proportions of humus, and of the siliceous, cretaceous,\r\nor argillaceous earths; the relative proportions of which render it\r\nstrong or light, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n[2838] As Fée says, these earths vary according to the nature of the\r\nsoils that are brought down by the streams; in general, however, they\r\nare extremely prolific.\r\n\r\n[2839] Fée says that Pliny is here guilty of some degree of\r\nexaggeration. See B. iii. c. 9, p. 195 of Vol. 1: also B. xviii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2840] “Tophus;” formed of volcanic scoriæ. Fée remarks, that it is\r\nsomewhat similar in nature to marl, and that though unproductive by\r\nitself, it is beneficial when mixed with vegetable earth. Tufa and marl\r\nappear to have been often confounded by the ancient writers.\r\n\r\n[2841] Georg. ii. 189.\r\n\r\n[2842] The Pteris aquilina of the modern botanists.\r\n\r\n[2843] Marine salt, or sub-hydrochlorate of soda, Fée thinks, is here\r\nalluded to. It is still used with varied success in some parts of the\r\nwest of France.\r\n\r\n[2844] Hardouin says, that he here alludes to the proverbial saying\r\namong the ancients, “Perflare altissima ventos”—“The winds blow only on\r\nthe most elevated ground.”\r\n\r\n[2845] In B. xiv. cc. 4 and 12.\r\n\r\n[2846] “Emisso.” Fée would appear to think that the lake suddenly\r\n_made its appearance_, after an earthquake, and from the context he\r\nwould appear to be right. These accounts are all of them borrowed from\r\nTheophrastus.\r\n\r\n[2847] See B. v. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[2848] See B. xv. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2849] See B. xiv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2850] See B. xiv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2851] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2852] See B. iii. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2853] Sumen. Properly, “udder.” A cow’s udder was considered one of\r\nthe choicest of delicacies by the Romans.\r\n\r\n[2854] This is, of course, an exaggeration. The stake must have been\r\ndriven in very deep to disappear so speedily.\r\n\r\n[2855] De Re Rust. 5.\r\n\r\n[2856] This he says in reference to his belief, with Epicurus, in the\r\neternity of matter.\r\n\r\n[2857] De Re Rust. 1.\r\n\r\n[2858] See B. iii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[2859] De Re Rust. 151.\r\n\r\n[2860] “Pulla.” The “vegetable” earth of modern botanists.\r\n\r\n[2861] “Teneram.”\r\n\r\n[2862] Iliad, xviii. 541 and 548.\r\n\r\n[2863] Vulcan.\r\n\r\n[2864] De Oratore, sec. 39.\r\n\r\n[2865] See B. xiii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2866] “Sapiunt,” rather than “redolent.”\r\n\r\n[2867] This supposed flavour of the earth is, in reality, attributable\r\nto the extraneous vegetable matter which it contains.\r\n\r\n[2868] See B. xii. c. 52, as to this notion.\r\n\r\n[2869] The reason being, that in such cases the soil is saturated with\r\nthyme, origanum, mint, and other odoriferous herbs.\r\n\r\n[2870] This opinion is contrary to that expressed by Columella, B.\r\nii. c. 1; but the justice of it is universally recognized. Upon this\r\ntheory, too, is based the modern practice of alternating the crops\r\nin successive years, the necessity of providing for heavy rents, not\r\nallowing the land to enjoy absolute rest.\r\n\r\n[2871] This has not come to pass even yet, nearly two thousand years\r\nsince the days of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2872] See B. v. c. 3, and B. xviii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2873] Fée taxes our author here with exaggeration. For Byzacium, see\r\nB. v. c. 3, and B. xviii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2874] Nevertheless, as Fée remarks, the method is often practised with\r\ngreat success. Pliny is at issue here with Theophrastus, De Causis, B.\r\niii. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[2875] A natural mixture of argilla and calcareous stones, or\r\nsubcarbonate of chalk. Fée remarks, that the ancients were not\r\nacquainted with the proper method of applying it. Marl only exercises\r\nits fertilizing influence after being reduced to dust by the action\r\nof the atmosphere, by absorbing the oxygen of the air, and giving to\r\nvegetation the carbonic acid that is necessary for their nourishment.\r\n\r\n[2876] “White argilla.” This, Fée thinks, is the calcareous marl, three\r\nvarieties of which are known, the compact, the schistoid, and the\r\nfriable.\r\n\r\n[2877] At the present day there are only two varieties of marl\r\nrecognized, the argillaceous and the calcareous; it is to the latter,\r\nFée thinks, that the varieties here mentioned as anciently recognized,\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\n[2878] The Marga terrea of Linnæus. It abounds in various parts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[2879] From the Greek, meaning “not bitter marl.”\r\n\r\n[2880] Marl does not begin to fertilize till several years after it has\r\nbeen laid down; hence, it is generally recommended to marl the land a\r\nlittle at a time, and often. If the ground is fully marled, it requires\r\nto be marled afresh in about eight or ten years, and not fifty, as\r\nPliny says.\r\n\r\n[2881] “Argentaria.” Used, probably, in the same way as whitening in\r\nmodern times. See B. xxxv. c. 58.\r\n\r\n[2882] An exaggeration, no doubt.\r\n\r\n[2883] Probably meaning “smooth marl;” a variety, Fée thinks, of\r\nargillaceous marl, and, perhaps, the potter’s argillaceous marl, or\r\npotter’s argil. He suggests, also that it may have possibly been\r\nthe Marga fullonum saponacea lamellosa of Valerius; in other words,\r\nfullers’ earth.\r\n\r\n[2884] Creta fullonia.\r\n\r\n[2885] See B. xxxv. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[2886] This would rather seem to be a name borrowed from the Greek,\r\nαἰγλήεις, “shining,” and πελιὸς, “white.” Notwithstanding the\r\nresemblance, however, it is just possible that it may have been derived\r\nfrom the Gallic. Fée queries whether this is the schistoid calcareous\r\nmarl, or the schistoid argillaceous marl, the laminæ of which divide\r\nwith great facility, and the varieties of which display many colours.\r\n\r\n[2887] A variety of the terreous marl.\r\n\r\n[2888] It has the effect of augmenting their fruitfulness, and\r\nameliorating the quality of the fruit. Lime is still considered an\r\nexcellent improver for strong, humid soils.\r\n\r\n[2889] From this passage, Fée thinks that the Columbine marl must have\r\nbeen of the white, slightly sparkling kind.\r\n\r\n[2890] Though ashes fertilize the ground, more particularly when of an\r\nargillaceous nature, they are not so extensively used now as in ancient\r\ntimes. Pliny alludes here more particularly to wood and dunghill ashes.\r\n\r\n[2891] This, however, he omits to do.\r\n\r\n[2892] He alludes, probably, to Theophrastus, De Causis, B. iii. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[2893] Odyssey xxiv. 225.\r\n\r\n[2894] From “stercus,” “dung.” A fabulous personage, most probably.\r\n\r\n[2895] De Re Rust. i. 38.\r\n\r\n[2896] De Re Rust. ii. 15.\r\n\r\n[2897] Mixed with other manures, it is employed at the present day in\r\nNormandy.\r\n\r\n[2898] This manure is still extensively employed in Flanders,\r\nSwitzerland, and the vicinity of Paris. In the north of England it is\r\nmixed with ashes, and laid on the fields. There was an old prejudice,\r\nthat vegetation grown with it has a fetid odour, but it has for some\r\ntime been looked upon as exploded.\r\n\r\n[2899] Or urine. In the vicinity of Paris, a manure is employed called\r\nurate, of which urine forms the basis.\r\n\r\n[2900] Fée seems to think that this passage means that the bad smell\r\nof urine is imparted to it by the wine that is drunk. It is difficult\r\nto say what could have been the noxious qualities imparted by wine to\r\nurine as a manure, and Pliny probably would have been somewhat at a\r\nloss to explain his meaning.\r\n\r\n[2901] In lapse of time, if exposed to the air, it is reduced to the\r\nstate of humus or mould.\r\n\r\n[2902] Consisting of lime mixed with vegetable ashes.\r\n\r\n[2903] De Re Rust. i. 38.\r\n\r\n[2904] “Herbas.” This would appear to mean grass only here; though Fée\r\nseems to think that it means various kinds of herbs.\r\n\r\n[2905] This method is sometimes adopted in England with buckwheat,\r\ntrefoil, peas, and other leguminous plants; and in the south of France\r\nlupines are still extensively used in the same manner, after the usage\r\nof the ancient Romans here described. The French also employ, but more\r\nrarely, for the same purpose, the large turnip, vetches, peas, trefoil,\r\nWindsor beans, sanfoin, lucerne, &c.; but it is found a very expensive\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n[2906] De Re Rust. 37.\r\n\r\n[2907] “Frondam putidam.” Fée thinks that this expression is used\r\nin reference to the “ebulum,” dane-wort, wall-wort, or dwarf-elder,\r\npreviously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2908] “Concidito.” Sillig adopts the reading “comburito,” “burn the\r\nshoots, and dig in, &c.” But in the original the word is “concidito.”\r\n\r\n[2909] De Re Rust. 30.\r\n\r\n[2910] This is still extensively practised in England and France, and\r\nother countries. The azote, even, that exhales from the bodies of the\r\nanimals, is supposed to have a fertilizing influence, to say nothing of\r\nthe dung, grease of the body, and urine.\r\n\r\n[2911] De Re Rust. 37.\r\n\r\n[2912] “Exsugunt,” “suck up,” or “drain,” is one reading in Cato; and\r\nit is not improbable that it is the correct one.\r\n\r\n[2913] Georg. i. 77, 78:\r\n\r\n  “Urit enim lini campum seges, urit avenæ,\r\n   Urunt Lethæo perfusa papavera somno.”\r\n\r\n[2914] Fée is of opinion, that, with reference to this branch of\r\nagriculture, the ancients displayed more skill and intelligence than\r\nthe moderns.\r\n\r\n[2915] This absurdity is copied from Varro and Columella.\r\n\r\n[2916] _I. e._ in the early part of spring. In modern times, the period\r\nfor manuring varies, according to the usage of different localities,\r\nbeing practised in all the four seasons of the year, according to the\r\ncrops, weather, and climate.\r\n\r\n[2917] See B. xvi. c. 58.\r\n\r\n[2918] The palm is grown in Africa from shoots thrown out from the\r\naxillæ of the leaves; and it is in this circumstance, Fée thinks, that\r\nthe story told by Trogus must have originated. Some of the ferns throw\r\nout adventitious buds from the summit of the leaf, and the orange tree\r\nand some others occasionally have them at the base of the leaf.\r\n\r\n[2919] Virgil says, Georgics ii. 14:\r\n\r\n  “Pars autem posito surgunt de semine; ut altæ\r\n   Castaneæ, nemorumque Jovi quæ maxime frondet.”\r\n\r\n[2920] This method of reproduction is seldom or never employed; plants\r\nor cuttings only being used for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[2921] Besides which, it is doubtful if they will reproduce the\r\nvariety, the seed of which was originally sown.\r\n\r\n[2922] In some cases, they are more particularly liable to disease—the\r\napple, for instance.\r\n\r\n[2923] Because the mode of cultivation adopted has little or no\r\ninfluence upon them. The palm, however, to bear good fruit, requires\r\nthe careful attention of man. It is not capable of being grafted.\r\n\r\n[2924] In B. xv. c. 39. The laurel may be grown from cuttings or\r\nshoots, and from seed.\r\n\r\n[2925] Known as the Laurus tinus, or Viburnum tinus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2926] This is not done at the present day, as it is found that the oil\r\nwhich they contain turns rancid, and prevents germination.\r\n\r\n[2927] These methods of preparation are no longer employed.\r\n\r\n[2928] It is for this reason, as already stated, that they should be\r\nsown at once.\r\n\r\n[2929] See B. xv. c. 39. He there calls it “sterilis,” “barren.”\r\n\r\n[2930] See B. xv. c. 37. The myrtle reproduces itself in its native\r\ncountries with great facility, but in such case the flowers are only\r\nsingle. Where a double flower is required, it is grown from layers.\r\n\r\n[2931] No better, Fée says, than the ordinary method of making a myrtle\r\nhedge.\r\n\r\n[2932] The almond requires a dry, light earth, and a southern aspect.\r\n\r\n[2933] These precautions are no longer observed at the present day.\r\n\r\n[2934] This precaution, too, is no longer observed.\r\n\r\n[2935] The citron is produced, at the present day, from either the\r\npips, plants, or cuttings.\r\n\r\n[2936] This passage is borrowed almost verbatim from Virgil, Georgics\r\nii. 50, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2937] “Perna.” This method of reproduction is still adopted, but it is\r\nnot to be recommended, as the young tree, before it throws out a root,\r\nis liable to be overthrown by high winds. Virgil mentions it, Georg.\r\nii. 23.\r\n\r\n[2938] Palladius only says that the growth of the quince in such case\r\nis very slow.\r\n\r\n[2939] This experiment has been tried for curiosity’s sake, and has\r\nsucceeded; the roots become dry, lose their fibres, and then develop\r\nbuds, from which branches issue; while the buds of the summit become\r\nchanged into roots.\r\n\r\n[2940] “Seminarii:” “nurseries,” as they are more commonly called.\r\n\r\n[2941] The distance, in reality, ought to vary according to the nature\r\nand species of the trees, and the height they are to be allowed to\r\nattain.\r\n\r\n[2942] De Re Rust. 48.\r\n\r\n[2943] These precautions are not looked upon as necessary for the\r\nindigenous trees at the present day. For the first year, however, Fée\r\nsays, the hurdles might be found very useful.\r\n\r\n[2944] As the young cypress is very delicate, in the northern climates,\r\nFée says, this mode of protecting it in the nursery might prove\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\n[2945] There is some exaggeration in this account of the extreme\r\nsmallness of the seed of the cypress.\r\n\r\n[2946] Wine and oil-presses, for instance.\r\n\r\n[2947] B. xix. c. 48, and B. xx. c. 11. As Fée remarks, this is\r\na fabulous assertion, which may still be based upon truth; as in\r\ngum-resin, for instance, we find occasionally the seeds of the parent\r\ntree accidentally enclosed in the tear-like drops.\r\n\r\n[2948] In B. xvi. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[2949] In c. 11 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2950] “Volgiolis.” This word is found nowhere else, and the reading is\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n[2951] This is, at least, an exaggeration.\r\n\r\n[2952] See B. xvi. c. 31, and c. 60.\r\n\r\n[2953] It is propagated at the present day both from seed and suckers,\r\nbut mostly from the latter, as the seed does not germinate for two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[2954] See B. xv. c. 14. Probably a variety of the jujube; but if so,\r\nit could hardly be grafted on trees of so different a nature as those\r\nhere mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2955] This tree has not been identified. Dalechamps thinks that it is\r\na species of gooseberry, probably the same as the Ribes grossularia of\r\nLinnæus. It has been also suggested that it may be the Spina cervina\r\nof the Italians, the Rhamnus catharticus of Linnæus, the purgative\r\nbuckthorn.\r\n\r\n[2956] Fée doubts if the plum can be grafted on the thorn.\r\n\r\n[2957] First of March.\r\n\r\n[2958] The thickness of the thumb. See the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2959] He alludes to the Atinian elm, of which he has already said the\r\nsame in B. xvi. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2960] From being about nine feet in circumference.\r\n\r\n[2961] A “little altar.”\r\n\r\n[2962] 13th of February.\r\n\r\n[2963] _I. e._ each at an angle with the other, in this form:—\r\n\r\n  *       *       *\r\n      *       *\r\n  *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was probably so called from the circumstance that each triangle\r\nresembles V, or five.\r\n\r\n[2964] This is the reason why a soil of only middling quality is\r\ngenerally selected for nurseries and seed-plots; otherwise it might be\r\ndifficult to transplant the young trees to an improved soil.\r\n\r\n[2965] The ordinary depth, at the present day, is about two feet; but\r\nwhen in an argillaceous soil, as Pliny says, the hole is made deeper.\r\nIf the soil is black mould, the hole is not so deep, and of a square\r\nform, just as recommended by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2966] De Re Rust. 43.\r\n\r\n[2967] This would be either useless, or positively injurious to the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n[2968] See B. xiv. c. 14. It seems impossible to say with exactness\r\nhow this passage came to be inserted in the context; but Sillig is\r\nprobably right in suspecting that there is a considerable lacuna here.\r\nIt is not improbable that Pliny may have enlarged upon the depth of the\r\nroots of trees, and the method of removing them in ancient times. Such\r\nbeing the case, he might think it not inappropriate to introduce the\r\nstory of Papirius, who, when only intending to have a stump cut down\r\nthat grew in the way, took the opportunity of frightening the prætor of\r\nPræneste, by the suddenness of the order to his lictor, and probably\r\nthe peremptory tone in which it was given. This was all the more\r\nserious to the prætor, as Papirius had been rebuking him just before in\r\nthe severest terms.\r\n\r\n[2969] From the bundle of fasces, or rods.\r\n\r\n[2970] This precept is borrowed from Virgil, Georg. ii. 348, et seq.\r\n\r\n[2971] There is little doubt that they took the right view.\r\n\r\n[2972] De Re Rust. 28.\r\n\r\n[2973] This precaution is omitted by the modern nurserymen, though Fée\r\nis inclined to think it might be attended with considerable advantage,\r\nas the fibres of the side that has faced the south are not likely to be\r\nso firm as those of the northern side. This precaution, however, would\r\nbe of more importance with exotic trees than indigenous ones. It is\r\nstill practised to some extent with the layers of the vine.\r\n\r\n[2974] Fée suggests that Pliny may have here misunderstood a passage in\r\nTheophrastus, Hist. Plant. ii. 8, with reference to the planting of the\r\nfig.\r\n\r\n[2975] There would be no such result, Fée says.\r\n\r\n[2976] This is a useless precaution; but at the same time, Pliny’s\r\nfears of its consequences are totally misplaced.\r\n\r\n[2977] At 11 A.M., or 2 P.M.; _i. e._ between south and south-east, and\r\nsouth and south-west.\r\n\r\n[2978] De Re Rust. 28.\r\n\r\n[2979] Wet moss, or moist earth, is used for the purpose at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[2980] De Re Rust. 28. It is most desirable to transplant trees with a\r\nlayer of the earth in which they have grown; but if carried out to any\r\nextent, it would be an expensive process.\r\n\r\n[2981] “Tradunt.” This expression shows that Pliny does not give credit\r\nto the statement. Columella and Palladius speak of _three_ stones being\r\nlaid under the root, evidently as a kind of charm.\r\n\r\n[2982] See B. xix. c. 30. A somewhat similar practice is also\r\nrecommended in B. xv. c. 18; but, of course, as Fée remarks, it can\r\nlead to no results.\r\n\r\n[2983] De Re Rust. 28.\r\n\r\n[2984] Fée remarks that this is a useful precaution, more particularly\r\nin the case of the coniferous trees, the fig, and others that are\r\nrich in juice; but if universally used, would be attended with great\r\nexpense. The French use for the purpose a mixture of fresh earth and\r\ncow-dung, to which they give the name of “onguent Saint-Fiacre.” See p.\r\n481.\r\n\r\n[2985] This is from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. ii. 7. The question,\r\nhowever, depends entirely upon the nature of the tree, the quality of\r\nthe soil, and various other considerations, as Pliny himself admits.\r\n\r\n[2986] See B. xv. c. 24. This notion, Fée remarks, still prevails to a\r\nvery considerable extent.\r\n\r\n[2987] By depriving it of the light, and the heat of the sun; but, most\r\nprobably, from no other reason.\r\n\r\n[2988] “Quoniam et protecta vinearum ratione egent.” This passage is\r\nprobably in a mutilated state.\r\n\r\n[2989] “In se convoluta.”\r\n\r\n[2990] The plane was much valued for its shade by convivial parties.\r\nHence we find in Virgil, Georg. iv. 146—“Atque ministrantem platanum\r\npotantibus umbram.”\r\n\r\n[2991] He clearly alludes to the quivering poplar, Populus tremula of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\n[2992] This is quite a fallacy. Even in the much more probable cases of\r\nthe upas and mangineel, it is not the fact.\r\n\r\n[2993] Theophrastus, De Causis, B. iii. c. 8, says, that trees that\r\ngrow on declivities have shorter branches than those of the same kind\r\ngrowing on plains.\r\n\r\n[2994] De Re Rust. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[2995] This assertion is doubtful; at the present day, in Andalusia,\r\nthe palm, the poplar, and many other trees are much larger than the\r\nolive.\r\n\r\n[2996] “Thousand pounders.” This, as Fée remarks, is clearly an\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\n[2997] Virgil, Georg. ii. 57, makes the same remark.\r\n\r\n[2998] This shrub has not been identified.\r\n\r\n[2999] See B. xii. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[3000] De Re Rust. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[3001] The French call cultivation by layers “marcotte,” as applied to\r\ntrees in general; and “provignage,” as applicable to the vine. The two\r\nmethods described by Pliny are still extensively practised.\r\n\r\n[3002] Taken from Cato, De Re Rust. c. 133.\r\n\r\n[3003] The Juniperus sabina of Linnæus: see B. xxiv. c. 61. It produces\r\nseed, and there is only one variety that is barren; the plant being, in\r\nreality, diœceous.\r\n\r\n[3004] The rosemary, in reality, is a hermaphroditic plant, and in all\r\ncases produces seed.\r\n\r\n[3005] See B. xvi. c. 33.\r\n\r\n[3006] This, Fée remarks, is in reality no more a case of grafting than\r\nthe growing of a tree from seed accidentally deposited in the cleft of\r\na rock.\r\n\r\n[3007] Still used for the reproduction of fruit-trees and shrubs in the\r\npleasure garden.\r\n\r\n[3008] Georg. ii. 73.\r\n\r\n[3009] This story is borrowed from Theophrastus, De Caus. B. ii. c. 19.\r\nFée remarks, that it is very doubtful if an operation of so coarse a\r\nnature could be productive of such results; and he says, that, at all\r\nevents, the two woods must have been species of the same genus, or else\r\nindividuals of the same family. The mode of grafting here described is\r\ncalled by agriculturists in foreign countries, “Pliny’s graft.”\r\n\r\n[3010] These statements as to the locality of the sap are erroneous.\r\n\r\n[3011] The fig is the only fruit that is not improved by grafting; but\r\nthen it is not similar to most fruit, being, as Fée says, nothing more\r\nthan a fleshy floral receptacle.\r\n\r\n[3012] This remark is founded on sound notions of vegetable physiology;\r\nbut at the same time it is contradictory to what he states in the\r\nsequel as to grafting the pear on the plane, the apple on the cornel,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[3013] Georg. ii. 78.\r\n\r\n[3014] An unnecessary precaution. It is not the situation of the\r\nbranches so much as the nature of the soil, traversed by the roots,\r\ncorresponding to them, that would be likely to have an influence on the\r\ngraft. There is little doubt that Pliny borrowed the present passage\r\nfrom Columella, De Re Rust. v. 11; and De Arbor. 20.\r\n\r\n[3015] This is sound advice.\r\n\r\n[3016] See B. xvi. c. 39, 40, and 41.\r\n\r\n[3017] In reprehending this absurd notion, Fée bestows a passing\r\ncensure on the superstitions of this nature, contained in the English\r\nVox Stellarum, one of our almanacks; and in the French “Almanach des\r\nBergers,” “Shepherds’ Almanack.”\r\n\r\n[3018] This is borrowed by Palladius, in the operations of February,\r\ntit. 17, and October, tit. 12.\r\n\r\n[3019] De Re Rust. 40.\r\n\r\n[3020] This is the onguent Saint-Fiacre of the French, and is still\r\nused to protect the graft from all contact with the exterior air.\r\n\r\n[3021] “Altitudinem,” as Dalechamps suggests, would appear to be a\r\nbetter reading than “latitudinem.”\r\n\r\n[3022] See B. xxv. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[3023] Borrowed from Columella, B. iv. c. 29. This method is still\r\nemployed for young plants; in France it is called “salting” the plants.\r\n\r\n[3024] De Re Rust. 41.\r\n\r\n[3025] The first of these methods is now the only one at all employed\r\nwith the vine; indeed, it is more generally reproduced by means of\r\nlayers and suckers.\r\n\r\n[3026] It is not accurately known what was the form or particular merit\r\nof this auger or wimble.\r\n\r\n[3027] Fée remarks, that the period here named is very indefinite. May\r\nand the early part of June are the periods now selected for grafting\r\nthe vine.\r\n\r\n[3028] This is borrowed from Varro, De Re Rust. B. i. c. 40. In\r\nreality, it makes no difference whether the stock is that of a wild\r\ntree or of the cultivated species.\r\n\r\n[3029] “Emplastrum.” Properly, the little strip of bark, which is\r\nfitted in with the eye, and which is _plastered_ or soldered down.\r\n\r\n[3030] “Scutula.” So called from its resemblance to a “little shield.”\r\n\r\n[3031] De Re Rust. 42.\r\n\r\n[3032] Cato says, three and a-half.\r\n\r\n[3033] Chalk and cow-dung. See c. 24 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3034] Perhaps “Tuliæ;” which would mean, according to Festus, the\r\n“cascades” or “waterfalls” of Tibur, now Tivoli.\r\n\r\n[3035] Fée says, that if we take the word “grafted” here in the\r\nstrictest sense, Pliny must have seen as great a marvel as any of those\r\nmentioned in the “Arabian Nights;” in fact, utter impossibilities. He\r\nthinks it possible, however, that a kind of mock grafting may have been\r\nproduced in the case, still employed in some parts of Italy, and known\r\nas the “greffe-Diane.” A trunk of an orange tree is split, and slips\r\nof numerous trees are then passed into it, which in time throw out\r\ntheir foliage and blossoms in various parts of the tree, or at the top;\r\nthe consequence of which is, that the stock appears to bear several\r\nvarieties of blossoms at the same moment. It is not improbable that\r\nPliny was thus imposed upon.\r\n\r\n[3036] The plane and the oak are no longer employed for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[3037] See B. xv. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[3038] See c. 29 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3039] See B. xv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[3040] The mulberry is incapable of being grafted on the elm.\r\n\r\n[3041] De Re Rust. 45. The method of planting here described is still\r\nthe one most generally approved of for the olive.\r\n\r\n[3042] De Re Rust. 44. The rules here given are still very generally\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n[3043] B. xv. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[3044] See c. 2 of this Book, and B. xviii. c. 69.\r\n\r\n[3045] The olive is an extremely long-lived tree; it has been known to\r\nlive as long as nine or ten centuries. A fragment of the bark, with a\r\nlittle wood attached, if put in the ground, will throw out roots and\r\nspring up. Hence it is not to be wondered at, that the ancients looked\r\nupon it as immortal.\r\n\r\n[3046] B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[3047] B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[3048] B. ii. c. 47, and B. xviii. c. 68.\r\n\r\n[3049] There is a contradiction here; a few lines above, he says that\r\nthey _do_ plant their trees in Greece at this period. He may possibly\r\nmean “sow.”\r\n\r\n[3050] See B. xvi. c. 41. The rules here laid down by Pliny are, as\r\nFée remarks, much too rigorous, and must be modified according to\r\nextraneous circumstances.\r\n\r\n[3051] 13th of February.\r\n\r\n[3052] B. xv. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[3053] 1st of March.\r\n\r\n[3054] 15th of March.\r\n\r\n[3055] B. xvi. cc. 30, 46, 67, and 78.\r\n\r\n[3056] De Re Rust. B. v. c. 11. A very absurd and useless method, Fée\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n[3057] In c. 24 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3058] All the precepts given in this Chapter have been already given\r\nin cc. 3 and 4 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3059] The maple, linden, elm, and arundo donax, are still employed,\r\nas well as the willow, for this purpose; the latter, however, but very\r\nrarely. The account of its cultivation here given is borrowed from\r\nColumella, De Re Rust. B. iv. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[3060] The Salix viminalis of Linnæus, or white osier.\r\n\r\n[3061] The Salix alba of Linnæus. These stakes, or props, are for the\r\nsupport of the vine.\r\n\r\n[3062] For making baskets and bindings.\r\n\r\n[3063] The Populus canescens of Willdenow.\r\n\r\n[3064] The Arundo donax of Linnæus. This account is mostly from\r\nColumella, B. iv. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[3065] B. xvi. c. 67.\r\n\r\n[3066] First of March.\r\n\r\n[3067] This method is condemned by Columella, De Arbor. 29, as the\r\nproduce is poor, meagre, and weak. It is but little practised at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n[3068] A mere superstition, of course.\r\n\r\n[3069] “Pedamenta,” uprights, stays, stakes, or props.\r\n\r\n[3070] This is not the fact, for the chesnut both grows and buds very\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n[3071] A black, hot kind of earth. See c. 3 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3072] In reality, the chesnut will not thrive in a tufaceous, or,\r\nindeed, in any kind of calcareous, soil.\r\n\r\n[3073] In B. xv. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[3074] The heaps of five in which they are sown.\r\n\r\n[3075] The chesnut is grown with the _greatest difficulty_ from layers\r\nand slips, and never from suckers. Pliny borrows this erroneous\r\nassertion from Columella, B. iv. c. 32. In mentioning the heaps of\r\nfive nuts, Pliny seems to have had some superstitious observance in\r\nview, for Columella only says that they must be sown thickly, to\r\nprevent accident. The same is done at the present day, in order to make\r\nprovision for the depredations of field-mice, rats, and mice, which are\r\nparticularly fond of them.\r\n\r\n[3076] The willow and the reed.\r\n\r\n[3077] See B. xvi. cc. 5, 6, and 56.\r\n\r\n[3078] In B. xvi. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[3079] “Armamentis.” More properly, “rigging,” or “tackle.” He alludes\r\nto the trees from which the uprights or stays for the vine are cut, or\r\nwhich produce osiers for baskets and bindings required in the vintage.\r\n\r\n[3080] See B. xiii. c. 42, and B. xvi. c. 65.\r\n\r\n[3081] “Gemma.” A name now given by botanists to the buds in general.\r\n\r\n[3082] “Oculus.” A bud undeveloped is still so called.\r\n\r\n[3083] Germen.\r\n\r\n[3084] This remark is not confirmed by experience.\r\n\r\n[3085] On the contrary, the fig-tree has been known to live to a very\r\ngreat age.\r\n\r\n[3086] See B. xvi. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[3087] This method of planting the vine is still extensively used;\r\nespecially the low kinds.\r\n\r\n[3088] See c. 13 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3089] Sagittæ.\r\n\r\n[3090] Trigemmes.\r\n\r\n[3091] “Pampinarius.” This assertion has been found to be erroneous.\r\n\r\n[3092] This practice has been condemned by modern cultivators.\r\n\r\n[3093] From Columella, B. iii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[3094] In c. 24 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3095] “Marra.” Probably a mattock, with several prongs.\r\n\r\n[3096] Occupies more space when thus loosened.\r\n\r\n[3097] As compared with the original level of the ground.\r\n\r\n[3098] Query, if this is the meaning of “extendi”?\r\n\r\n[3099] This method is no longer used.\r\n\r\n[3100] This, Fée remarks, is not the case: the tree might bear four\r\nkinds of grapes, but not four kinds on the same bunch.\r\n\r\n[3101] De Arbor. c. 9. This is not the fact.\r\n\r\n[3102] He was little aware, Fée says, that all ligneous plants have a\r\nradiating pith, distinct from the central one.\r\n\r\n[3103] See B. xvi. c. 72.\r\n\r\n[3104] Oliver de Serres distinguishes only three—the low, middling, and\r\ntall vines.\r\n\r\n[3105] See B. xiv. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[3106] See B. xiv. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[3107] “Jugum.” The cross-piece running along the top of the stay at\r\nright angles; a rail or trail.\r\n\r\n[3108] “Compluviatæ quadruplici.” Four cross-pieces running at right\r\nangles to the prop or stay. See B. xvi. c. 68.\r\n\r\n[3109] When these trenches and furrows are employed by the moderns,\r\nthey are made to run as much as possible from east to west. Most of the\r\nrules here mentioned by Pliny are still adopted in France.\r\n\r\n[3110] Fée regards this precept as a puerility.\r\n\r\n[3111] See B. xviii. c. 77.\r\n\r\n[3112] See B. xviii. c. 77. Decuman roads or paths ran from east to\r\nwest; cardinal roads were those at right angles to them.\r\n\r\n[3113] “Pagina.” A set, compartment, or bed.\r\n\r\n[3114] “Transtris.” “Ridges,” would appear to be the proper reading\r\nhere; more especially as it agrees with what has been previously said\r\nin this Chapter in reference to declivitous ground.\r\n\r\n[3115] De Re Rust. 40.\r\n\r\n[3116] He differs somewhat in these measurements from Columella, B. iv.\r\nc. 11.\r\n\r\n[3117] This is condemned by Columella, B. iv. c. 11; but is approved of\r\nby Virgil, Cato, and other authors.\r\n\r\n[3118] In c. 34 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3119] Stays of elder would be utterly worthless, as they would soon\r\nrot, and break directly, upon the least strain.\r\n\r\n[3120] This applies solely, Fée observes, to the vine trained on the\r\ntrail or cross-piece.\r\n\r\n[3121] This certainly appears to be a _non sequitur_, as applied to the\r\nvine.\r\n\r\n[3122] In the present Chapter.\r\n\r\n[3123] Pampinarium.\r\n\r\n[3124] Fructuarium.\r\n\r\n[3125] Custos.\r\n\r\n[3126] The pilferer, “or little thief,” apparently.\r\n\r\n[3127] This, Fée observes, is not in accordance with the fact.\r\n\r\n[3128] “Draco.” Male vines appear to have been a kind that threw out no\r\nstock-branches, but ran to wood.\r\n\r\n[3129] Than three buds, as already mentioned in the present Chapter.\r\n\r\n[3130] “Pollices.” Branches, so called from the resemblance, being cut\r\noff above the first eye. See Columella, De Re Rust. B. iv. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[3131] Small forks of hazel are still used for the purpose, in Berri\r\nand the Orleanais.\r\n\r\n[3132] This plan is highly recommended by the modern growers.\r\n\r\n[3133] This, as Fée remarks, is based upon sound reason.\r\n\r\n[3134] In B. xiv. cc. 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n[3135] B. xviii. c. 66.\r\n\r\n[3136] 13th of April.\r\n\r\n[3137] 10th of May.\r\n\r\n[3138] A mere puerility—the dust, in fact, being injurious to the\r\ngrape, by obstructing the natural action of heat and humidity.\r\n\r\n[3139] 15th of May. This clearing of the leaves, though still\r\npractised, Fée says, is by no means beneficial; the only result is,\r\nthat the grapes become of a higher colour, but in no degree riper than\r\nthey otherwise would have been.\r\n\r\n[3140] The proper period for pruning varies in reality according to the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n[3141] See B. xviii. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[3142] See Columella, De Re Rust. B. iv. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[3143] The real reason, as Fée remarks, is the comparative facility of\r\ncutting aslant rather than horizontally; indeed, if the latter were\r\nattempted, injury to the wood would be the certain result.\r\n\r\n[3144] The pruning should come first, in every case, Fée says.\r\n\r\n[3145] De Re Rust. c. 33. The advice given by him, though good, is not\r\napplicable to all vineyards.\r\n\r\n[3146] A sort of clover, probably. See B. xviii. c. 42, and a few lines\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n[3147] From the Greek ὠκέως, “quickly”—Varro says.\r\n\r\n[3148] See c. 15 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3149] It is still practised in Dauphiné and the department of the\r\nBasses Alpes. It is very prevalent, also, in the South of Italy.\r\n\r\n[3150] All these trees are still employed for the purpose in Italy.\r\n\r\n[3151] B. xvi. c. 68.\r\n\r\n[3152] Palmæ.\r\n\r\n[3153] From Columella, B. v. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[3154] This method is no longer employed.\r\n\r\n[3155] Rasilis.\r\n\r\n[3156] Columella, B. v. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[3157] Columella, B. v. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[3158] Capreolis.\r\n\r\n[3159] As being too dense and shady.\r\n\r\n[3160] From the Greek, meaning the “vine-band.” It was, probably, a\r\nkind of rush.\r\n\r\n[3161] Fée thinks that he may mean the Festuca fluitans more\r\nparticularly, by the name _ulva_.\r\n\r\n[3162] It is no longer used, and Fée doubts its utility.\r\n\r\n[3163] Hardouin suggests “Tarracina.”\r\n\r\n[3164] In c. 16 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3165] To drain the upper part of the tree.\r\n\r\n[3166] Pergulas. See B. xiv. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[3167] See B. xviii. c. 56. These, of course, are mere superstitions.\r\n\r\n[3168] Animalium.\r\n\r\n[3169] In B. xiii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[3170] In B. xiii. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[3171] This is the opinion of Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. iv. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[3172] In c. 2 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3173] “Vermiculatio.” Fée understands this to apply to the attacks of\r\ninsects in general, the Dermestes typographus more particularly.\r\n\r\n[3174] Or, in other words, the evil influences of the heavenly bodies:\r\nthis, of course, is not believed in at the present day.\r\n\r\n[3175] Necrosis, in particular portions of the plant.\r\n\r\n[3176] See B. xvi. c. 19. He alludes to an exuberant secretion of\r\nresin, in which case the tree becomes charged with it like a torch.\r\n\r\n[3177] He alludes to the epidemic and contagious maladies by which\r\ntrees are attacked. The causes of these attacks are often unknown,\r\nbut they may probably proceed, in many instances, from springs of hot\r\nwater, or gaseous emanations secreted in the earth.\r\n\r\n[3178] The woodpecker more particularly. See B. x. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[3179] It is not known, with certainty, what these worms or\r\ncaterpillars were. The larva of the capricorn beetle, or of the\r\nstag-beetle, has been suggested. Geoffroi thinks that it may have been\r\nthe larva of the palm-weevil. This taste for caterpillars, probably, no\r\nlonger prevails in any part of Europe.\r\n\r\n[3180] This passage, which is quite conformable to truth, is from\r\nTheophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. iv. c. 16, and B. iii. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[3181] See B. xvi. c. 80.\r\n\r\n[3182] The effects produced upon young shoots by frost, are still so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n[3183] Probably from the black colour which it turns.\r\n\r\n[3184] In this case it would be very similar to what we call sun-stroke.\r\n\r\n[3185] “Clavum,” a nail. He appears to allude to a gall that appears on\r\nthe bark of the olive, the eruption forming the shape of a nail, and,\r\nin some instances, a “patella,” or platter. The Coccus adonideum is an\r\ninsect that is very destructive to the olive.\r\n\r\n[3186] De Re Rust. 6.\r\n\r\n[3187] A sort of Erineum, Fée suggests. See B. xv. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[3188] “Impetigo.” “Tetter,” or “ringworm,” literally.\r\n\r\n[3189] From Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. iv. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[3190] Σφακελισμὸς and κράδος.\r\n\r\n[3191] From Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. iv. c. 16. Fée is at a loss\r\nto know what is meant by these viscous dews, and is unable to identify\r\nthe disease here mentioned as “scabies.” It is not improbable that it\r\nwas caused by an insect.\r\n\r\n[3192] See cc. 35 and 45 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3193] See B. xviii. c. 69.\r\n\r\n[3194] In c. 35. See also c. 45 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3195] From Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. iv. c. 16. If the terminal\r\nbud of the palm is taken off, it will mostly die.\r\n\r\n[3196] “Decidunt.” The French use a similar word—_couler_. In this case\r\nthe pollen, being washed off by the showers, has not the opportunity of\r\nfecundating the ovary of the flower.\r\n\r\n[3197] The insect Ichneumon or Pupivora, probably, which breeds in\r\nthe larvæ or else in the body of the caterpillar. The passage is from\r\nTheophrastus, B. iv. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[3198] Caused probably by a maggot or moth passing from one grape\r\nor olive to another, and spinning its web in vast quantities. See\r\nTheophrastus, B. iv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[3199] See B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[3200] On the contrary, this sweet juice is secreted by the insect\r\nitself, an aphis or vine-fretter.\r\n\r\n[3201] The north-west wind. See Horace, Sat. B. i. s. v. l. 71.\r\n\r\n[3202] See B. ii. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[3203] He probably means if applied _to the bark_ of young trees.\r\n\r\n[3204] The cork-tree forms no exception to the rule—if a complete ring\r\nof the bark that lies under the epidermis is removed, the death of the\r\ntree is the inevitable result. See B. xvi. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[3205] Probably the Arbutus integrifolia. See B. xiii. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[3206] This in reality is not the bark, but merely the epidermis, which\r\nis capable of reproduction in many trees.\r\n\r\n[3207] See c. 16 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3208] This method, however, is often found efficacious in preserving\r\nthe life of the oak, as well as many other trees, by excluding the\r\naction of the air and water.\r\n\r\n[3209] It prevents them from increasing in height, but does not cause\r\ntheir death.\r\n\r\n[3210] De Re Rust. B. i. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[3211] In B. viii. c. 76, and B. xv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[3212] This statement is fabulous. Goats are apt to injure trees by\r\nbiting the buds and young shoots. Fabulous as it is, however, Fée\r\nremarks that it still obtains credit among the peasantry in France.\r\n\r\n[3213] This fabulous story is taken from Theophrastus, De Causis, B. v.\r\nc. 25.\r\n\r\n[3214] Also from Theophrastus, Hist. Plant. B. iv. cc. 19-20, and De\r\nCausis, B. v. c. 22. It is just possible that on some of the branches\r\nbeing torn off by an animal, the tree may have grown with increased\r\nvigour.\r\n\r\n[3215] In B. xiii. c. 9, and in c. 30 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3216] See B. xvi. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[3217] It must be remembered that ivy is not a parasite, and that it\r\nhas no suckers to absorb the nutriment of another tree.\r\n\r\n[3218] See B. xvi. c. 62.\r\n\r\n[3219] C. Bauhin gives this name to several species of Atriplex. Lacuna\r\nwas of opinion that the Halimon of Dioscorides was the same as the\r\nViburnum.\r\n\r\n[3220] A superstitious belief only, as Fée remarks.\r\n\r\n[3221] See B. xix. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[3222] Virgil shared this belief: see Georg. ii. l. 299.\r\n\r\n[3223] This may be true in some measure as to nitre, alum, and warm\r\nsea-water; but not so as to the shells of beans and pigeon-pease, which\r\nwould make an excellent manure for it.\r\n\r\n[3224] This, as Fée remarks, is not by any means impossible, nor,\r\nindeed, are any other of the cases mentioned in this paragraph, owing\r\nto some accidental circumstance.\r\n\r\n[3225] See B. xxix. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[3226] These stories can, of course, be only regarded as fabulous.\r\n\r\n[3227] This may easily be accounted for, by the seed accidentally\r\nlodging in a crevice of the tree.\r\n\r\n[3228] A. U. C. 600.\r\n\r\n[3229] An exaggerated account merely of a land-slip.\r\n\r\n[3230] See c. 43 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3231] See c. 45 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3232] In B. xvi. cc. 53, 56, 66, 67, and 90.\r\n\r\n[3233] This was the native place of Ovid, who alludes to its cold\r\nstreams, Tristia, B. iv. El. x. ll. 3, 4:—\r\n\r\n  “Sulmo mihi patria est, gelidis uberrimus undis,\r\n    Millia qui novies distat ab urbe decem.”\r\n\r\nIrrigation of the vine is still practised in the east, in Italy, and in\r\nSpain; but it does not tend to improve the quality of the wine.\r\n\r\n[3234] The Sagrus, now the Sangro.\r\n\r\n[3235] “Uredo rubigo” and “uredo caries.”\r\n\r\n[3236] Cc. 45 and 70.\r\n\r\n[3237] Still practised upon the cherry-tree.\r\n\r\n[3238] He alludes to the medical operation for the removal of carious\r\nbones, described by Celsus, B. viii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[3239] This is still done by some persons; but it can be productive of\r\nno beneficial result.\r\n\r\n[3240] See B. xv. c. 21: the Cynips psenes of Linn. It penetrates the\r\nfig at the base, and deposits an egg in each seed, which is ultimately\r\neaten by the larva; hence the supposed transformation.\r\n\r\n[3241] A kind of wasp, probably.\r\n\r\n[3242] A puerility borrowed from Columella, B. v. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[3243] From Columella, B. v. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[3244] Trucidatio.\r\n\r\n[3245] For the removal of moss and lichens, which obstruct evaporation,\r\nand collect moisture to an inconvenient degree, besides harbouring\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n[3246] Agriculturists, Fée says, are not agreed upon this question.\r\n\r\n[3247] Or laser. See B. xix. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[3248] See B. xviii. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[3249] Pœnâ emendantur.\r\n\r\n[3250] It is very doubtful whether this is not likely to prove very\r\ninjurious to them. This passage is from Theophrastus, De Causis, B.\r\niii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[3251] Without any efficacy, beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\n[3252] The action of salt upon vegetation is, at the best, very\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n[3253] These recipes are worthless, and almost impracticable.\r\n\r\n[3254] This method is still adopted, but with none of the accessories\r\nhere mentioned by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[3255] A dangerous practice, Fée remarks, and certainly not to be\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n[3256] Mitior.\r\n\r\n[3257] De Re Rust. 93.\r\n\r\n[3258] At the present day, fumigations are preferred to any such\r\nmixtures as those here described. Caterpillars are killed by the fumes\r\nof sulphur, bitumen, or damp straw.\r\n\r\n[3259] “Convolvulus.” He alludes to the vine Pyralis, one of the\r\nLepidoptera, the caterpillar of which rolls itself up in the leaves of\r\nthe tree, after eating away the foot-stalk.\r\n\r\n[3260] The “fly,” or “winged” insect. The grey weevil, Fée thinks, that\r\neats the buds and the young grapes.\r\n\r\n[3261] An absurd superstition.\r\n\r\n[3262] This may possibly be efficacious, but the other precepts here\r\ngiven are full of absurdity.\r\n\r\n[3263] It might possibly drive them to a distance, but would do no more.\r\n\r\n[3264] An absurd notion, very similar to some connected with the same\r\nsubject, which have prevailed even in recent times.\r\n\r\n[3265] De Re Rust. 160. The words of this charm over the split reed\r\nwhile held near the injured limb, were as follow:—“Sanitas fracto—motas\r\ndanata daries dardaries astataries”—mere gibberish.\r\n\r\n[3266] De Re Rust. 139. This prayer was offered to the deity of the\r\nsacred grove, after a pig had been first offered—“If thou art a god, or\r\nif thou art a goddess, to whom this grove is sacred, may it be allowed\r\nme, through the expiation made by this pig, and for the purpose of\r\nrestraining the overgrowth of this grove, &c.” It must be remembered\r\nthat it was considered a most heinous offence to cut down or lop a\r\nconsecrated grove.
