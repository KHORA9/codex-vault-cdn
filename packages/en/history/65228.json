We have\r\nno trace of who the poets were who produced that vast collection of\r\nballads and romances, which, full of chivalry and adventure, love and\r\nwar, fascinate the imagination, and bestow immortality on heroes--some\r\nreal, some fictitious--who otherwise had never been known. To understand\r\nthe merits of the later writers, to know on what their style and spirit\r\nwas formed, it is necessary to give some account of the early, and also\r\nof the anonymous, poetry of Spain. Nor will it be foreign to the\r\nsubject, nor uninteresting, slightly to trace the progress of literature\r\nin the Peninsula from its earliest date. From a thousand causes Spain is\r\nthe land of romance. There never was any one who has travelled in that\r\ncountry, whatever might be his political opinions, or his view of human\r\nnature and society, but admired and loved the Spaniards. There is an\r\noriginality, an independence, an enthusiasm, in the Spanish character\r\nthat distinguishes them from every other people. Despotism and the\r\nInquisition, ignorance and superstition, have been unable to level the\r\nnoble altitude of their souls; and even while the manifestations of\r\ngenius have been crushed, genius has survived.\r\n\r\nFrom early times Spain was the birthplace of men of eminence in\r\nliterature. We know little of the aborigines, and nothing of their\r\nlanguage, except that from the earliest times they appear to have been\r\ngifted with that love of song that survives to this day. Silius Italicus\r\nhears testimony to this taste, when with all the arrogance of assumed\r\nsuperiority he speaks of the verses sung by the Gallicians in their\r\nnative dialect, \"barbara nunc patriis ululantem carmina linguis,\" and\r\nStrabo alludes to immemorial ballads sung by the inhabitants of Betica.\r\nWhen the Spaniards shared the refinements and learning of the capital,\r\nseveral names became distinguished. Lucan was a native of Cordova. We\r\ncan fancy that we trace the genuine Spanish spirit in this\r\npoet--earnestness, enthusiasm, gaudiness, and an inveterate tendency to\r\ndiffuseness. The two Senecas were natives, also, of the same town.[1]\r\nThe Spaniards with fond pride collect other names which the tide of time\r\nsweeping by, has cast on the shore, too obscure for fame, but\r\nsufficiently known to prove that the Spanish nation was always prolific\r\nin men who sought to distinguish themselves in literature.\r\n\r\nThese recollections, however, belong to another race. The Visigoths\r\nswept over the land, annihilated the Roman power, and, as far as any\r\ntraces that have come down to us avouch, absorbed the aboriginal Iberian\r\nin their invasion. Yet, though they conquered and reigned over the land,\r\nit is to be doubted how far they actually amalgamated with the natives.\r\nAnd it is conjectured that one of the causes why the Moors, after\r\nconquering Don Roderick in battle, so soon possessed themselves of city\r\nand district, and founded what at first was a sway as peaceful as\r\nuniversal, was occasioned by the distinction still subsisting between\r\nIberian and Goth, which led the former the more readily to submit to new\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nThe Goths were an illiterate people. There is an anecdote recorded in\r\nproof of their barbarism on this point. Queen Amalasunta, who appears to\r\nhave possessed a more refined and exalted mind than the men of her time,\r\nwas eager to confer on her son Alaric the graces and accomplishments of\r\nliterature. The warriors of the land opposed her purpose,--\"No,\" they\r\ncried, \"the idleness of study is unworthy of the Goth: high thoughts of\r\nglory are not fed by books, but by deeds of valour. He is to be a king\r\nwhom all should dread. He shall not be compelled to fear his\r\ninstructors.\"[2]\r\n\r\nAnother proof of the ignorance and small influence of the Goths is their\r\nhaving adopted the language of the conquered country. All that has come\r\ndown to us from them, with the exception of a few inscriptions, is in\r\nthe Latin language, and several poems were written in that tongue. Still\r\nthe Goths loved warlike songs and music. To their days some would trace\r\nthe redondilla, while it has also been conjectured that the peculiar\r\nrhythm of these national ballads had its origin in the camp songs of the\r\nRoman soldiers.[3]\r\n\r\nAt length the Gothic power fell--the Moors entered, overran, and\r\nconquered Spain. At first the resistance they met was not at all\r\nproportionate to what we should consider to have been the resources of\r\nthe Spanish nation. But a noble spirit of resistance was awakened.\r\nDifference of religion kept alive what difference of language and habits\r\noriginated. The enthusiastic patriotism which had gathered as waters in\r\na mountain tarn, overflowed from the heights to which it had retreated,\r\nand finally poured over the whole land. From the struggle that ensued a\r\nthousand deeds of heroism had birth, and those circumstances were\r\ndeveloped, which became the subjects to be consecrated by those\r\nbeautiful ballads and songs, \"in which,\" to use the appropriate language\r\nof a modern critic, \"truth wears the graceful garb of romance, and\r\nromance appears the honest handmaid of truth.\"\r\n\r\nSpain owed much to the Moor, however, from other causes. The Arabs were\r\na learned and refined race. They built cities, palaces, and mosques;\r\nthey founded universities, they encouraged learning. The most eminent\r\nscholars came from the East to grace their schools, and introduced a\r\nspirit of inquiry and a love of knowledge which survived their power.\r\nAbdorrhaman III. founded the university at Cordova. He established\r\nschools and collected a library, it is said, to the extent of six\r\nhundred thousand volumes. The blessings of civilisation was fostered by\r\nthe Omajad dynasty. Mahometanism never flourished with such true glory\r\nas under the Spanish caliphs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable circumstances of this era is, the prosperity\r\nand learning of the Jews settled in Spain. Persecuted by the Goths[4],\r\nthis hapless nation doubtless welcomed the Moors gladly; and finding\r\ntoleration under their rule, and their schools open to them, they\r\nflocked to the universities of Cordova and Toledo in such numbers, that\r\none Jewish writer tells us that there were twelve thousand Israelitish\r\nstudents at Toledo; and they gave evidence of the perseverance,\r\nsagacity, and talent which belong to that people, and which, fostered by\r\nthe blessed spirit of toleration, bore worthy fruit.\r\n\r\nA succession of Hebrew scholars may be traced from the tenth to the\r\nfifteenth centuries. De Castro gives an account of seven hundred\r\ndifferent works. Every Jew could read. The higher classes flourished in\r\nglory and prosperity, so that many of the noblest Spanish families\r\ninclude Jewish sprouts in the tree of their genealogy. Even to this day\r\nthe Jews' sons of those driven from Spain to this country remember their\r\nSpanish renown, and have preserved a recollection of its language.\r\n\r\nOf the Arabic authors of Spain the greater portion were natives of\r\nAndalusia. The number of their poets was very considerable. Of the\r\n_Romances Moriscos_ doubtless many originated in Arabic poetry. The old\r\nRoman rhythm, the Gothic love of music, the Arab chivalry, and the noble\r\nspirit generated by a generous love of freedom, were the sources of\r\nthese romances. Before we recur to them however, we will mention the\r\nconnection between the troubadour and Provençal poetry with the\r\nValentian. It is a singular anomaly, we may almost call it, in\r\nliterature, that a dialect become a written one, adorned by poets and\r\nspoken through extensive provinces, should have become the dead tongue\r\nof modern times. The French, Italian, and Castillian absorbed the genius\r\nthat once took form in a tongue which, whether it be called Provençal,\r\nLimousin, or Valentian, is still the same, and in it were written the\r\nearliest modern verses. Petrarch and Dante raised their native tongue in\r\nopposition; but the poetry they studied as anterior to their own was the\r\nProvençal. The peculiar tone of troubadour poetry; the refined and\r\nsomewhat abstract mode in which love is treated, was adopted by\r\nPetrarch, and by Dante also, in his sonnets and canzoni. The rhythm and\r\nthe subjects were more artful and scientific than the songs of Castille,\r\nand thus at one time it was held in higher regard by the Spanish\r\nsovereigns who wished to introduce learning and poetry among their\r\nsubjects. John I. of Arragon invited many Provençal and Narbonne poets\r\nto settle at Barcelona and Tortosa. He established an academy in the\r\nformer city for the cultivation of poetry. The Spanish troubadours\r\nbecame celebrated; Mosen Jordi de Sant Jordi is one of the first and\r\nbest-known. Petrarch read and, perhaps, imitated him.[5]\r\n\r\nThough protected and encouraged by the sovereigns of Arragon, and read\r\nand lauded, and even imitated, by the nobles of their courts, the\r\nValentian never became the national poetry of Spain, and we turn from\r\npoets who will find better place among the early French writers to the\r\ngenuine productions of Castille.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that it was during the Moorish wars, under the successors\r\nof Don Pelayo, that these romances had birth. The kings of the various\r\nprovinces of Spain, ever at war with the Moors, were, of course, in a\r\nstate of great dependence on their warrior nobles. They needed their\r\nsubjects to form expeditions against the enemy or to resist their\r\nencroachments. Often, also, the Spanish princes were at enmity with each\r\nother; and civil discord, or the war of one Christian kingdom against\r\nthe other, caused temporary alliance with the Mahometans. This brought\r\nthe chivalry of the two nations into contact. The Spaniards learned the\r\narts of civilisation from their conquerors--they learned also the\r\nlanguage of love.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these romantic wars, there sprung up a species of poetry\r\nwhich in its simplicity and truth resembles the old English ballads, but\r\nwhich, from the nature of the events it commemorates, is conceived in a\r\nloftier and more chivalrous tone. The most ancient of these is a poem on\r\nthe Cid, written an hundred and fifty years before the time of Dante:\r\nits versification is barbarous. It was written in the infancy of\r\nlanguage; but it displays touches of nature, and a vivacity of action,\r\nthat show it to have been the work of men of an heroic and virile age.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the romances or ballads of Spain assumed a lighter and more\r\ntripping rhythm, fitter to be easily remembered and to be accompanied by\r\nmusic. These metrical compositions were called _redondillas._[6]\r\nBoutervek imagines that they may be considered as a relic of the songs\r\nof the Roman soldiers. There was something singularly popular in their\r\nfreedom from constraint, and catching in their effect on the ear. The\r\nsonorous harmony of the Spanish language gave them dignity; they were\r\neasy to compose, easy to remember; they required only a subject, and the\r\nwords flowed, as it were, with the facility of a running stream.\r\n\r\nThere are several volumes, called the Cancionero general and Romancero\r\ngeneral, filled with these compositions. The most singular circumstance\r\nis, that they are nearly all anonymous. No doubt, as language improved,\r\nthey were altered and amended from oral tradition, and no one had a\r\nright to claim undivided authorship. Their subjects were love and war,\r\nand came home to the heart of every Spaniard: the sentiments were\r\nsimple, yet heroic; the action was always impassioned, and sometimes\r\ntragic.\r\n\r\nDoctor Bowring, who has a happy facility in rendering the poetry of\r\nforeign nations into our own, has been more felicitous than any other\r\nauthor in translating these compositions. His volume is well known, and\r\nwe will not quote largely from it, as we are tempted. One poem, which\r\nBoutervek pronounces to be untranslatable through its airiness and\r\nlightness, we present as a specimen of that talent, so peculiar to the\r\nredondilla, of catching and portraying a sentiment, as it were, by\r\nsketches and hints, where the reader fills up the picture from his own\r\nimagination, and is pleased by the very vagueness which incites him to\r\nexert that faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Lovely flow'ret, lovely flow'ret--\r\nOh! what thoughts your beauties move!\r\nWhen I pressed thee to my bosom,\r\nLittle did I know of love;\r\nNow that I have learnt to love thee.\r\nSeeking thee in vain I rove.'\r\n\r\n'But the fault was thine, young warrior,\r\nThine it was--it was not mine;\r\nHe who brought thy earliest letter,\r\nWas a messenger of thine;\r\nAnd he told me--graceless traitor--\r\nYes! he told me--lying one--\r\nThat thou wert already married\r\nIn the province of Leon;\r\nWhere thou hadst a lovely lady,\r\nAnd, like flowers too, many a son.'\r\n\r\n'Lady! he was but a traitor.\r\nAnd his tale was all untrue,\r\nIn Castille I never entered--\r\nFrom Leon too, I withdrew\r\nWhen I was in early boyhood,\r\nAnd of love I nothing knew.'\"[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to these ballads we must mention the romances of chivalry.\r\nThere is an undying discussion as to the nation in which these works\r\noriginated. According to Spanish writers, the real author of the first\r\nor genuine Amadis was Vasco Lobeira, a native of Portugal, who\r\nflourished at the end of the thirteenth century, and lived till the year\r\n1325. Perverted as history and geography are in this and other similar\r\nworks, they are full of invention, and alive with human feeling. Heroic\r\ndeeds are blended with fairy machinery, borrowed from Arabian tales;\r\nevery thing is brought in to adorn and to exalt the character of the\r\nknight, in war and in love. Even now Amadis preserves its charm; hew\r\ngreat must have been its influence among nobles whose lives were\r\ndedicated to the hardships of war, and whose own hearts were the\r\nbirthplace of passion, as sincere and vehement as any that warmed the\r\nheart of fictitious cavalier.\r\n\r\nAlready, however, had various kings and nobles of Spain cultivated\r\nletters. The first authors whose names appear were less of poets than\r\nmany whose works appear in the various Cancioneros. Elevated in rank,\r\nthey addicted themselves to study from a love of knowledge. Eagerly\r\ncurious about the secrets of nature, or observant of the philosophy of\r\nlife, they were desirous of instructing their countrymen. They deserve\r\ninfinite praise for their exertions, and the motives that animated them;\r\nbut their productions cannot have the same interest for us as the\r\ngenuine emanations of the feelings. The heart of man, its passions and\r\nits emotions, endures for ever the same, and the poet who touches with\r\ntruth the simplest of its chords remains immortal; but our heads change\r\ntheir fashion and furniture. We disregard obsolete knowledge as a ruin,\r\nout of proportion and fallen to pieces; while the language of the\r\npassions, like vegetation for ever growing, is always fresh. Alphonso\r\nX., surnamed the Wise, loved learning. He rendered a great service to\r\nhis country by the cultivation he bestowed on the Castillian language.\r\nHis verses bear the marks of the attention he paid to correctness, and\r\nby his command the Spanish language was substituted for Latin in public\r\ninstruments. Through him the Bible was translated into Castillian, and a\r\nChronicle of Spain was commenced under his directions. He favoured the\r\ntroubadours, and himself aspired to write verses. There is an entire\r\nbook of Cantigas or Letras, composed in the Gallician dialect, by him.\r\nEl Teroso is his principal work; it detailed his alchymical secrets, and\r\nis written in Castillian, in versos de arte mayor: much of this work\r\nremains still undeciphered. To him also is attributed a poem called Las\r\nQuerellas, of which two stanzas only are preserved, and those so\r\nsuperior in versification to the Tesoro, that it is doubted whether they\r\ncan be the production of the same man and age. The most useful work that\r\nowed its existence to his superintendence was the Alphonsine Tables,\r\ncontaining calculations truly extraordinary for that period.\r\n\r\nAlphonso XI. followed in his footsteps in the cultivation of the\r\nCastillian language. He is said to have composed a General Chronicle of\r\nRedondillas, which is lost.\r\n\r\nIt was in the time of Alphonso XI. that Don Juan Manuel wrote his Count\r\nLucanor, a series of tales put together somewhat in the style of the\r\n\"Seven Wise Masters.\" An inexperienced prince, when in any difficulty,\r\napplies to his minister for advice, who replies by relating some tale or\r\nfable, concluded by a maxim in verse, as the moral of the story. These\r\nshow his knowledge of the world; and one, in opposition to that of the\r\nGrecian sage, who said, men were to treat their friends as if they were\r\none day to become their enemies, deserves to be recorded in honour of\r\nthe more noble-minded Castilian;\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Quien te conseja encobrir de tus amigos,\r\nengañarte quiera assaz, y sin testigos.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Whoever counsels you to be reserved with your friends, wishes to betray\r\nyou without witnesses.\" Count Lucanor is praised for the artless\r\nsimplicity of its style, joined to acuteness of observation. In\r\naddition, Manuel composed a Chronicle of Spain, and other prose works,\r\nas well as several poems.\r\n\r\nThe civil wars and rebellions that desolated Spain at this time checked\r\nthe literary spirit, and prevented the cultivation of learning. Juan\r\nRuiz, arch-priest of Hita, and Ayala, the historiographer, are almost\r\nthe only names we find in addition to those already mentioned. Juan Ruiz\r\nwrote an allegorical satire in Castillian Alexandrines.\r\n\r\nWith John II., who reigned from 1407 to 1454, began a brighter æra.\r\nPolitically, his reign was disastrous and stormy. The monarchy was\r\nthreatened with destruction, and the king had not sufficient firmness to\r\nmake himself respected. His love of poetry and learning, sympathised in\r\nby many of his nobles, secured him, however, the affections of his\r\nadherents; and in the midst of civil commotion, despite his deficiency\r\nof resolution, there gathered round him a court faithful to his cause,\r\nand civilised by its love of letters. The marquess of Villena had\r\nalready distinguished himself; he was so celebrated for his acquirements\r\nin natural and metaphysical knowledge that he came to be looked on as a\r\nmagician. He was admired also as a poet. He wrote an allegorical drama,\r\nwhich was represented at court. He translated the Æneid, and extended\r\nhis patronage and protection to other poets by instituting floral games.\r\nTo instruct them, he wrote a sort of Art of Poetry, termed La Gaya\r\nCiencia. In it he praises, as Petrarch had done at the Neapolitan court,\r\nthe uses of poetry. \"So great,\" he says, \"are the benefits derived from\r\nthis science on civil life, banishing indolence and employing noble\r\nminds in useful inquiries, that other nations have sought and\r\nestablished among themselves schools for this art, so that it became\r\nspread through various parts of the world.\" The zeal of this noble\r\nelevated the art he protected; he inspired others, as well born as\r\nhimself, with equal enthusiasm, and was the patron of those less\r\nfortunate in worldly advantages. He died at Madrid in 1434.\r\n\r\nHis friend and pupil, the marquess of Santillana, was a better poet.\r\nQuintana remarks of him that \"he was one of the most generous and\r\nvaliant knights that adorned his age. A learned man, an easy and sweet\r\nlove poet, just and serious in sentiment.\" His elegy on the death of the\r\nmarquess of Villena is the most celebrated of his poems. Other names\r\noccur of less note. Jorge Manrique, who has left a fragment of poetry\r\nmore purely written than belongs to his age. Garci Sanchez of Badajos,\r\nand Marcias. This last is less known for his poetry, of which we possess\r\nonly four songs, than for his melancholy death. He loved one who refused\r\nto, or, disdaining, him, married another. But still he was unable to\r\nconquer his fatal attachment. The husband obtained that he should be\r\nthrown into prison; but this did not suffice for his vengeance, nor are\r\nwe surprised when we know the delicate sense of connubial honour\r\nentertained by the Spaniards. He, the husband, concerted with the\r\nalcaide of the tower in which Marcias was imprisoned, and found means to\r\nthrow his lance at him as he stood at a window. Marcias was at this\r\nmoment singing one of the songs he had composed upon the lady of his\r\nlove; the lance pierced him to the heart, and he died with the tale of\r\npassion still hovering on his lips. These circumstances, and probably\r\nthe enthusiastic and amiable qualities of the poet, rendered him an\r\nobject of reverence and regret to his countrymen. He was surnamed the\r\nEnemorado, and his name, grown into a proverb, is still the synonyme in\r\nSpain for a martyr to devoted love. His contemporary, Juan de Mena, has\r\ncommemorated his death in some of the sweetest and most poetic verses of\r\nhis Labyrinto.\r\n\r\nJuan de Mena is often called the Ennius of Spain. He is the most\r\nrenowned of the writers of that early age. He was born at Cordova in\r\nabout the year 1412. Cordova, the seat of the most famous Moorish\r\nuniversity, had just been recovered by the Christians. Juan de Mena was\r\nsprung from a respectable though not noble family; at the age of\r\ntwenty-three he fulfilled some civil office in his native city, of which\r\nin after times he spoke with affection, as we find these lines in one of\r\nhis poems:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thou flower of wisdom and of chivalry,\r\nCordova, mother mine! forgive thy son,\r\nIf in the music of my lyre, no tone\r\nBe sweet and loud enough to honour thee.\r\nModels of wisdom and of bravery\r\nI see reflected through thy annals bright.\r\nI will not praise thee, praise thee though I might.\r\nLest I of flattery should suspected be.\"[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nJuan de Mena studied, however, at the university of Salamanca, and,\r\ninduced by a love of inquiry and desire to gain knowledge, made a\r\njourney to Rome. Sismondi says, \"On becoming acquainted with the poetry\r\nof Dante, his imagination received no inspiration, and his taste was\r\nspoilt. His greatest work is called El Labyrinto, or Las Trescients\r\nCoplas; it is an allegory, in tetradactyls, of human life.\" A man is\r\nmore likely to be incited by the spirit of his age than a single poem.\r\nDante and his contemporaries had most at heart the instructing of their\r\nfellow-creatures. The great Tuscan poet, in his Divina Commedia, had the\r\ndesign of comprehending all human knowledge; and the literary men of\r\nthose days considered visions the proper poetical mode of conveying the\r\nsecrets of nature and of morals. It is no wonder that Juan de Mena,\r\nwhose poetic genius was certainly not of the highest description (it\r\nmight be compared to that of Bruno Latini, the master of Dante), was\r\nmore led away by the theories and tenets he must have heard continually\r\ndiscussed in conversation in Italy, and endeavoured, as his highest aim,\r\nrather to instruct his countrymen in the mysteries of life and death,\r\nnature and philosophy, than to express actions and feelings in such\r\nharmonious numbers as he heard frequently carolled among the hills, or\r\nsung at night beneath some beauty's window. The romances we now prize,\r\nas the genuine and poetic expression of the passions of man, could not\r\nin his eyes aspire to the height of the muse, whom he sought to gift\r\nwith the power of penetrating and explaining the mysteries of life and\r\ndeath--the globe and all that it contains.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, however, he excited the respect of the patrons of\r\nlearning. King John and the marquess of Santillana both honoured and\r\nloved him; he was named one of the king's historiographers, an\r\ninstitution originating with Alphonso X., and those appointed to it were\r\nexpected to continue the national chronicles down to their own time.\r\nJuan de Mena lived in high favour at the court of John II., and\r\nconstantly adhered to him. He died in 1456, at Guadalaxara in New\r\nCastille, and the marquess of Santillana erected a monument to him.\r\n\r\nQuintana speaks of the _Labyrinto_ as \"the most interesting monument of\r\nSpanish poetry in that age, which left all contemporary writers far\r\nbehind him.\" But after all, it is a mere specimen of the poetic art of\r\nthose days: not like Dante, could be put a human soul into his allegory,\r\nwhich wins and enchants with ever renewing interest, nor adorn visible\r\nobjects with that truth and delicacy, and vividness of description, in\r\nwhich art Dante has been unsurpassed by any poet of any age or country.\r\nJuan de Mena's allegory is heavy, his details tiresome, the interest\r\nabsolutely null, and his poetical invention, such as it was, subordinate\r\nto false learning.\r\n\r\nHe intends to sing of the vicissitudes of fortune, ruled, as they are,\r\nby the seven planets, to whom Providence gives such power. He invokes\r\nApollo and Calliope, and then apostrophises Fortune, asking leave to\r\nblame her when she may deserve censure. He then, in imitation of all\r\nvision-writers, loses himself, when a lady of wonderful beauty appears,\r\nand presents herself to him as his guide. The lady is Providence: she\r\nbids him look, and he goes on to describe what he saw:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning my eyes to where she bade me gaze,\r\nBehold, three ponderous wheels I saw within;\r\nAnd two were still--nor even moved their place;\r\nThe other swiftly, round and round, did spin.\r\nBelow them on the ground I saw the space\r\nO'erspread by nations vast, who once had been,\r\nAnd each upon the brow engraven wore\r\nThe name and fate the which on earth they bore.\r\n\r\nAnd in one wheel that stood immoveable\r\nI saw the gatherings of a future race;\r\nAnd that, which to the ground was doomed to fall,\r\nA dark veil cast upon the hideous place,\r\nCovered with all her dead.--I was not able\r\nThe meaning of the sight I saw to trace;\r\nSo I implored my guide that she would show\r\nThe meaning of the vision there below.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wheels of course represent the past, present, and future, each\r\ngoverned by the seven planets. Providence points out the various\r\npersonages distinguished in the wheel of the past and the present; and\r\nthe poet has thus occasion to make great display of knowledge on every\r\nsubject, and deduces from time to time maxims upon the conduct of life\r\nand the government of nations; and thus, as Dante intended in his\r\nCommedia, does Juan de Mena introduce instruction on all the sciences\r\nthen known. In common with every writer of his class, he thinks more of\r\nwhat he has to say, than of the melody of his versification; sometimes\r\nhis subject suggests lines at once animated and sonorous; at other times\r\nthey are tame or turgid. He is not backward in giving moral lessons,\r\neither to prince or people; yet Quintana regards this work probably with\r\ntoo much partiality when he says that we shall always dip into it with\r\npleasure. We regard it with some curiosity, and more respect, and with\r\nbut little liking.\r\n\r\nOne other name we will mention, since it is connected with the Spanish\r\ntheatre; and dramatic writing became in progress of time the most truly\r\nnational as well as original and perfect form in which the genius of\r\nSpanish poetry embodied itself. Juan de Enzina wrote the first Spanish\r\nplays. It is true that Villena wrote an allegorical drama, which is\r\nlost, and other compositions took the form of dialogue; but Enzina, who\r\nwas a musical composer, converted mere pastoral eclogues into real\r\ndramas. He was born at Salamanca, in the reign of Isabella. He travelled\r\nto Jerusalem, in company with the marquis de Tarifa, and he lived some\r\ntime at Rome, as maestro da capella, or director of music, to pope Leo\r\nX. These travels and residences at a distance from his native country,\r\nmust have stored his mind with ideas; but though Italy had reached the\r\nzenith of her poetic glory at that time, he became no pupil of hers.\r\nPerhaps he found Spanish metres, and the Spanish poetic diction did not\r\nlend itself to any but the Spanish style; and he never dreamt, as Boscan\r\nafterwards so admirably succeeded in doing, of enlarging the sphere of\r\nSpanish poetry by introducing Italian modes of rhythm: his songs and\r\nlyrics are in the style of the cancioneros; and the very quips and\r\ncranks in which he indulged have the rough humour and extravagant\r\nimagination of Castile, not the pointed wit or airy lightness of Italy.\r\nAmong other things, he published a song of contraries, or absurdities,\r\n(_disparates_,) which has made his name proverbial in Spain. He\r\nconverted Virgil's eclogues into ballads, and applied to the sovereigns\r\nand nobles of Spain the compliments Virgil addressed to the emperor\r\nAugustus. His sacred and profane eclogues were acted at court at\r\nChristmas-eve and carnival: these are lost. Some of his songs,\r\ncalculated to become popular from their spirit, and the tone they\r\nseized, which was suited to the hour, remain. There is one translated by\r\nDr. Bowring, which is a Farewell to the Carnival (Antruejo), which, in\r\nthe Spanish at least, has all the zest and animation of a drinking\r\nsong:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come let us eat and drink to-day.\r\nAnd sing, and laugh, and banish sorrow,\r\nFor we must part to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIn Antruejo's honour--fill\r\nThe laughing cup with wine and glee,\r\nAnd feast and dance with eager will,\r\nAnd crowd the hours with revelry,\r\nFor that is wisdom's counsel still--\r\nTo day be gay, and banish sorrow,\r\nFor we must part to-morrow.\r\n\r\nHonour the saint--the morning ray\r\nWill introduce the monster death;\r\nThere's breathing space for joy to-day,\r\nTo-morrow ye shall gasp for breath;\r\nSo now be frolicsome and gay,\r\nAnd tread joy's round and banish sorrow,\r\nFor we must part to-morrow.\"[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the state of Spain had wholly changed. The struggle with the\r\nMoors had ended, and its civil dissentions were no more. The union of\r\nthe crowns of Aragon and Castile under Ferdinand and Isabella placed the\r\ncountry under one sovereign; and the conquest of Granada put an end to\r\nthe last Moorish kingdom. The Spaniards, with their constitutional\r\nCortes, made a noble struggle for civil liberty at the beginning of the\r\nreign of Charles V.; but they failed, and an absolute monarchy, guarded\r\nby the most nefarious of all institutions, the inquisition, was\r\nestablished; the vaunted privileges of the grandees of Spain became\r\nmatters of court etiquette, instead of lofty manifestations of their\r\nequality with their sovereign; the conquest of America brought money to\r\nthe country, which was quickly drained from it by the wars in Italy;\r\nwhile the Lutheran heresy again set alight those cruel fires which were\r\nat first destined for aliens,--such Jews and Moors might be termed.\r\nLiberty of thought, as well as of action, was destroyed; and though the\r\nterrors of the inquisition were displayed more in Flanders than in the\r\nPeninsula itself, that arose from the circumstance that in the one\r\ncountry it was resisted, while in the other it was submitted to with a\r\nprostration of soul unknown to any other country or age.\r\n\r\nFor a time, however, the energies of the nation were rather turned aside\r\nthan checked by these events. The noble spirit of Padilla existed in the\r\nSpanish bosom, though turned from its elevated patriotism. The\r\nachievements of Charles V. awoke enthusiastic loyalty; while his\r\nenterprises gave birth to a series of warriors and heroes. Their vast\r\nacquisitions in what they named the Indies, added to the splendour of\r\nthe Spanish name. Glory, if not liberty; pride, though not independence,\r\nawoke in them a courageous and daring, though stern and cruel spirit,\r\nwhich led to those successes which spread a lustre over their name and\r\nage. But at the same time it must be observed, that these very wars and\r\nconquests drained Spain of those ardent and enterprising spirits, who,\r\nif they had not been so employed, had probably exerted themselves to\r\nfree their country, and to withstand those encroachments of royalty, and\r\nthe church, which, after the lapse of a few years, acted so\r\ndetrimentally on the prosperity of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe crown of Castile also rose in eminence over that of Aragon, and the\r\nCastilian became the language of the court. Writers, in whatever\r\nprovince their birthplace might be cast, adopted Castilian as the\r\nclassic language of the country.\r\n\r\nJuan de Enzina, though he had sojourned in Italy, became imbued by none\r\nof its spirit. It could not always be thus. The Neapolitan wars in the\r\ntime of Ferdinand caused numbers of Spaniards to visit Italy. From the\r\nvery beginning of the reign of Charles V., these wars increased in\r\nimportance, and the intercourse between the two countries became more\r\nfrequent and intimate. The time therefore was at hand when Spain would\r\nlearn from Italy that poetic art in which she was yet a child, though a\r\nchild of genius. At this epoch we commence the lives of the literary men\r\nof Spain. They came out many at once, like a constellation. The first in\r\nthe list were born either quite at the end of the fifteenth, or at the\r\nvery commencement of the sixteenth century, and accordingly were\r\ncontemporaries of Charles V.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Duosque Senecas, unicumque Lucanum,\r\nFacunda loquitur Corduba.\"\r\n\r\n_Martial_, ep.

III., in the article on\r\nthe poetical literature of Spain, the whole of Sant Jordi's Song of\r\nContraries (Cancion de Opositos), is given, from which Petrarch adopted,\r\nit is alleged, whole lines. Nothing is less derogatory to a poet of the\r\nhighest genius than the fact that he picked up here and there lines and\r\nideas, amalgamating them with his own, and adorning them with alien\r\nsplendour. It is honourable, however, to Sant Jordi, to be stolen from\r\nthe spirit of the two poems is different and the lines scattered and\r\ndisconnected. Those of Petrarch are--and they are some of his finest--\r\n\r\n\"Pace non trovo e non ho da far guerra,\r\nE volo sopra 'l cielo, e giaceio in terra,\r\nE nulla stringo e tutto il mondo abraccio,\r\nE ho in odio me stesso e amo altrui,\r\nSe non e amor, cosé dunque ch'io sento?\"\r\n\r\nSant Jordi, describing the struggles of his mind, has these\r\nsimilar lines:--\r\n\r\n\"E no strench res, e tot lo mon abras,\r\nvol sovel cel, e nom movi de terra.\"\r\n\r\nAnd both Italian and Provençal bear the same translation.\r\n\r\nI nothing grasp--and yet the world embrace:\r\nI fly o'er highest heaven, though bound to earth.\r\n\r\nAs also--\r\n\r\n\"Hoy he de mi, e vull altra gran he.\"\r\nI hate myself--others are dear to me.\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n\"E no he pace--e no tench gium ganeig.\"\r\nI'm not at peace, but cannot war declare.\r\n\r\nPetrarch's poem describes a lover's struggles; Sant Jordi's, the combats\r\nof an inquisitive, troubled mind--something of a Faustus spirit, though\r\nhe sums up all, not by selling himself to the devil, but concluding\r\npiously,--\r\n\r\nBut right oft flows from darkness-covered wrong,\r\nAnd good may spring from seeming evil here.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: \"All verses consisting of four trochaic feet appear to have\r\nbeen originally comprehended under the name of _redondilla_, which,\r\nhowever, came at length to be in preference usually applied to one\r\nparticular species of this description of verse. It is difficult to\r\nsuppose that the redondillas have been formed in imitation of bisected\r\nhexameters, as some Spanish authors have imagined; they may with more\r\nprobability be considered a relic of the songs of the Roman soldiers. In\r\nsuch verses every individual could, without restraint, pour forth the\r\nfeelings which love or gallantry dictated, accompanied by his guitar, as\r\nlittle attention was paid to correctness in the distinction of long or\r\nshort syllables, as in the rhyme. When one of the poetic narratives,\r\ndistinguished by the name of romances was sung, line followed line\r\nwithout constraint, the expression flowing with careless freedom, as\r\nfeeling gave it birth. When, however, romantic sentiments were to be\r\nclothed in a popular lyric dress, to exhibit the playful turns of ideas\r\nunder still more pleasing forms, it was found advantageous to introduce\r\ndivisions and periods, which gave rise to regular strophes (_estancias_\r\nand _coplas_). Lines, for the sake of variety, were shortened by halving\r\nthem; and thus the tender and impressive melody of the rhythm was\r\nsometimes considerably heightened. Seduced by the example of the Arabs,\r\nsomething excellent was supposed to be accomplished when a single\r\nsonorous and unvarying rhyme was rendered prominent throughout all the\r\nverses of a long romance. Through other romances, however, pairs of\r\nrhymeless verses were allowed to glide amidst a variety of rhymed ones.\r\nAt length, at a later period, it was observed that, in point of\r\nelegance, the _redondilla_ was improved by the change, when, instead of\r\nperfect rhymes, imperfect ones, or sounds echoing vowels but not\r\nconsonants, were heard in the terminating syllables. Hence arose the\r\ndistinction between consonant and assonant verses, which has been\r\nconverted into a rhythmical beauty unknown to other nations. The period\r\nof the invention of the redondillas was also nearly that of the dactylic\r\nstanzas called _versos de arte mayor_, because their composition was\r\nconsidered an art of a superior order. As the inventors of these stanzas\r\nwere ignorant of the true principles of prosody, the attention paid to\r\npurity in the rhythm of the dactyles was even less than in the rhymes of\r\nthe redondillas. This may account for these verses falling into disuse,\r\nas the progressive improvement of taste, which allowed the redondillas\r\nto maintain their original consideration, was not reconcileable with the\r\nhalf-dancing half-hobbling rhymed lines of the _versos de arte\r\nmayor._\"--_Boutervek_, Introduction. (Translation.)\r\n\r\nLord Holland observes, in the Appendix No. 3. to his \"Life of Lope de\r\nVega:\"--\"Of rhymes the Spaniards have two sorts; the consonante or full\r\nrhyme, which is nearly the same as the Italian; and the asonante, which\r\nthe ear of a foreigner would not immediately distinguish from a blank\r\ntermination. An asonante is a word that resembles another in the vowel\r\non which the last accent falls, as well as the vowel or vowels that\r\nfollow; but every consonant after the accented vowel must be different\r\nfrom that in the corresponding syllable. Thus, tòs and _amor_, _pecho_,\r\nfuego, _alamo_, paxaro, are all asonantes. In modern compositions, where\r\nthe asonante is used, every alternate verse is blank, but the poet is\r\nnot allowed to change the asonante till the poem is concluded. The old\r\nwriters, I believe, were no such restriction.\"\r\n\r\nM. Gunins, a German annotator, followed by Mr. Lockhart, expresses his\r\nopinion that \"the stanza was composed in reality of two long lines, and\r\nthat these have been subsequently cut in four, exactly as we know to\r\nhave been the case in regard to another old English ballad stanza.\" See\r\nMr. Lockhart's Introduction to his Ancient Spanish Ballads.\r\n\r\nThus, instead of printing it, as is usual,--\r\n\r\n\"Fizo hazer al Rey Alfonso\r\nel cid un solene juro,\r\ndelante de muchos grandes,\r\nque se hallaron en Brugos\"--\r\n\r\nthis ought to run--\r\n\r\n\"Fizo hazer al Rey Alfonso, el cid un solene juro,\r\ndelante de muchos grandes, que se hallaron en Brugos.\"\r\n\r\nThe u, in the penultimate syllable of juro, and in Brugos, makes the\r\nassonance of the redondilla. We need not mention to the Spanish reader\r\nthe peculiar mode of printing Spanish poetry without the distinction of\r\ncapitals at the beginning of lines; nor the peculiar punctuation--a note\r\nof interrogation reversed invariably being placed at the beginning of\r\nthe sentence that ends with one; necessary to the otherwise obscure\r\nconstruction of the Spanish: as for instance,--\r\n\r\n\"¿Buelas al fin, y al fin te vas llorando?\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"'Rosa fresca, Rosa fresca,\r\ntan garrida y con amor,\r\ncuando os tiene en mis brazos\r\nno vos sabia servir no,\r\ny agora que vos serviria\r\nno vos puedo yo haber no.'\r\n\r\nVuestra fué la culpa, amigo\r\nvuestra fué, que mia no,\r\nenviastes me una carta\r\ncon un vuestro servidor,\r\ny en lugar de recaudar\r\nel digera otra razon,\r\nque erades casado, amigo,\r\nalia en tierras de León,\r\nque teneis muger hermosa\r\ny hijos como una flor.'\r\n\r\n'Quien os lo dijo, Señora,\r\nno vos dija verdad, no--\r\nque yo nunca entré in Castilla\r\nni en las tierras de León,\r\nsino cuando era pequeño\r\nque no sabia de amor.'\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: \"O flor de saber y cabelleria,\r\nCordoba madre, tu hijo perdona,\r\nsi en los cantares, que agora pregona\r\nno divulgré tu sabiduria.\r\nDe sabios, valientes loarte podria\r\nqui fueron espejo muy maravilloso;\r\npor ser de ti mismo, seré sopechoso,\r\ndirán que los pinto mejor que debia.\"\r\n\r\n_Wiffen's Life of Garcilaso._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: \"Bolviendo los ojos a do me mandava,\r\nvi mas adentro muy grandes tres ruedas,\r\nlas dos gran firmes, immotas y quedas\r\nmas la del medio boltar no cessava.\r\nVi que debaxo de todos estava\r\ncaida por tierra grand gente infinita,\r\nque avia en la fronte cada qual escrita,\r\nel mombre y la suerte por donde passava.\r\n\r\nY vi que en la una que no se movia,\r\nla gente que en ella avia de ser,\r\ny la que debaxo esperava caer\r\ncon turbido velo sumorte cubria.\r\nY yo que de aquello muy poco sentia,\r\nfiz de mi dubda complida palabra;\r\na mi guiadora, rogando que me abra\r\naquesta figura que yo no entendia.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: \"Hoy comamos y bebamos,\r\ny cantemos y holguemos\r\nque mañana ayunaremos.\r\n\r\nPor honra de San Antruejo\r\nparemonos hoy bien anchos,\r\nembutamos estos panchos,\r\nrecalquemos el pellejo\r\nque costumbre es de concejo\r\nque todo hoy nos hartemos,\r\npues manana ayunaremos.\r\n\r\nHonremos a tan buen santo\r\nque mañana viene la muerte,\r\ncomamos, bebemos huerte\r\nque mañana habra quebranto\r\ncomamos, bebamos tanto\r\nhasta que nos reventemos,\r\npues mañana ayunaremos.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSCAN\r\n\r\n1500-1543.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Spanish poet who introduced the Italian style was Mosen Juan\r\nBoscan Almogaver. He was a man of mild and contemplative disposition,\r\nand thus fitted to receive the shackles of rules of taste from others,\r\nat the same time that, being a genuine poet, he could animate the\r\nharmony and grace of his versification with earnest sentiments and\r\noriginal thought. Restrain himself as he would, the genius of the\r\nSpanish language and early association, forced him into greater\r\nvividness and simplicity of expression than his Italian prototypes; and\r\nat the same time, being a Catalonian, the very language of Castile,\r\nwhich, as having become the classic language of his country, he adopted,\r\nwas to a certain degree a foreign tongue, and he could more easily\r\nabandon the peculiar rhythm of its national poetry for versification,\r\nsuch as was to be found in the productions of the Provençal poets, to\r\nwhich his native country and dialect were akin.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the life of Boscan beyond its mere outline. He was\r\nborn at Barcelona at the close of the fifteenth century, of a noble and\r\nancient family. He followed the career of arms in his youth, and\r\ntravelled during a few years. He married donna Ana Giron de Rebolledo, a\r\nlady of distinguished birth; and he commemorates their domestic\r\nhappiness in his verses, dwelling on the detail with all the fondness\r\nand pride that springs from a thankful enjoyment of a tranquil life.\r\nAfter his marriage he resided almost constantly at his native town of\r\nBarcelona, though sometimes he attended the court of the emperor Charles\r\nV., where he was held in high consideration. At one time, strange to\r\nsay, he filled the office of governor to the youthful duke of Alva,\r\nwhose cruelties have gained for him such ill renown. That he was so, is\r\nrather a blot in his character with us; among his countrymen it is\r\notherwise. Spanish writers regard the duke of Alva as a hero. His crimes\r\nhad place in a distant land--in his own he was distinguished for his\r\nmagnificence and his talents, while his very bigotry was considered a\r\nvirtue. When, therefore. Sedano mentions this circumstance, he speaks of\r\nit with pride, saying, \"Boscan's rank, joined to his blameless manners\r\nand his talents, caused him to be chosen governor to the great duke of\r\nAlva, don Fernando, which office he filled with success, as is proved by\r\nthe heroic virtues that adorned the soul of his pupil, which were the\r\nresult of Boscan's education.\"\r\n\r\nFrom early youth Boscan was a poet; at first he wrote in the old Spanish\r\nstyle; but he was still young when his attention was called to the\r\nclassic productions of Italy, and he was incited to adopt the Italian\r\nversification and elegiac style, so to enlarge the sphere of Spanish\r\npoetry. It was in the pear 1525 that Andrea Navagero came as ambassador\r\nfrom Venice to the court of the emperor Charles V. at Toledo. The\r\nVenetian was of noble birth, and so addicted to study as to injure his\r\nhealth by the severity of his application.[11] A state of melancholy\r\nensued, only to be alleviated by travel. He was familiar with Greek and\r\nLatin literature, and cultivated a refined taste that could scarcely be\r\nsatisfied by the most finished productions of his native land, while he\r\nexercised the severest judgment, even to the destruction of his own. At\r\nToledo he fell in with Boscan and Garcilaso. Their tastes, their love of\r\npoetry and of the classics, were the same; and the superior learning of\r\nthe Italian led him to act the preceptor to his younger friends. Through\r\nhis arguments they were led to quit the composition of their national\r\nredondillas, and to aspire to introduce more elegance and a wider scope\r\nof ideas into their native poetry. Boscan, in his dedication of a volume\r\nof his poems, which included several of Garcilaso's, to the duchess of\r\nSoma, thus mentions the circumstances that led them to contemplate this\r\nchange: \"Conversing one day on literary subjects with Navagero the\r\nVenetian ambassador (whom I wish to mention to your ladyship as a man of\r\ngreat celebrity in these days), and particularly upon the different\r\ngenius of various languages, he inquired of me why, in Castilian, we\r\nnever attempted sonnets and other kinds of composition used by the best\r\nwriters in Italy; he not only said this, but urged me to set the\r\nexample. A few days after I departed home, and musing on a variety of\r\nthings during a long and solitary journey, frequently reflected on\r\nNavagero's advice, and thus at length began the attempt. I found at\r\nfirst some difficulty, as this kind of versification is extremely\r\ncomplex, and has many peculiarities different from ours; but afterwards,\r\nfrom the partiality we naturally entertain towards our own productions,\r\nI thought I had succeeded well, and gradually grew warm and eager in the\r\npursuit. This, however, would not have been sufficient to stimulate me\r\nto proceed, had not Garcilaso encouraged me, whose judgment, not only in\r\nmy opinion, but in that of the whole world, is esteemed a certain rule.\r\nPraising uniformly my essays, and giving me the highest possible mark of\r\napprobation in following himself my example, he induced me to devote\r\nmyself exclusively to the undertaking.\r\n\r\nEvery thing combines to give us the idea of Boscan as a good and a happy\r\nman, enjoying so much of prosperity and rank as would make him feel\r\nsatisfied and complacent, and endowed with such talents as rendered\r\npoetry a pleasing occupation, and the fame he acquired delightful.\r\nBlessed with a mild and affectionate disposition, happily married,\r\nliving contented, he possessed advantages that must have added greatly\r\nto his happiness, through the good fortune which gave him accomplished\r\nand noble friends, addicted to the same studies, delighting in the same\r\npursuits, sympathising in his views, and affording him the assistance of\r\ntheir applause and imitation. What we know of Boscan, indeed, is\r\nprincipally through the mention made of him by his friends. Garcilaso de\r\nla Vega, superior to his friend as a poet, was one of those gallant\r\nspirits whose existence is a poem, and was closely allied to him in\r\nfriendship. It was through Garcilaso's advice and encouragement that\r\nBoscan translated Castiglione's _Libro del Cortigiano_,--a book then\r\njust published, and which enjoyed the highest repute in Italy. The\r\ntranslation was accompanied by a dedication written by Garcilaso, which\r\nSedano praises as \"an exquisite piece of eloquence,\" in which he speaks\r\nof his friend with the fond praise which genuine affection inspires.\r\nSeveral of Garcilaso's sonnets, an epistle, and an elegy, are addressed\r\nto Boscan, and all breathe a mixture of friendship and esteem delightful\r\nto contemplate. He mentions him also in his second eclogue. When\r\ndescribing the sculpture on a vase of the God of the river Tormes, he\r\ndescribes don Fernando, duke of Alva, as being depicted among other\r\nheroes of the age, and Boscan, in attendance, as his preceptor. It must\r\nbe remembered, that when this elegy was written, the duke was in the\r\nbloom of youth, and regarded as the man of promise of his age; while his\r\nlife was yet unstained by the crimes that render him hateful in our\r\neyes. It is a sage named Severo who is gazing on the urn of old Tormes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Next as his looks along the sculptures glanced,\r\nA youth with Phœbus hand in hand advanced;\r\nCourteous his air, from his ingenuous face,\r\nInform'd with wisdom, modesty, and grace,\r\nAnd every mild affection, at a scan\r\nThe passer-by would mark him for a man,\r\nPerfect in all gentilities of mind\r\nThat sweeten life and harmonise mankind.\r\nThe form which lively thus the sculptor drew,\r\nAssured Severo in an instant knew,\r\nFor him who had by careful culture shown\r\nFernando's spirit, lovely as his own;\r\nHad given him grace, sincerity, and ease,\r\nThe pure politeness that aspires to please,\r\nThe candid virtues that disdain pretence,\r\nAnd martial manliness, and sprightly sense,\r\nWith all the generous courtesies enshrined\r\nIn the fair temple of Fernando's mind.\r\nWhen well surveyed his name Severo read,\r\n'Boscan!' whose genius o'er the world is spread,\r\nIn whose illumined aspect shines the fire\r\nThat, stream'd from Delphos, lights him to the lyre,\r\nAnd warms those songs which with mankind shall stay\r\nWhilst endless ages roll unfelt away.\"[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides Garcilaso, Boscan enjoyed the friendship of a man, far different\r\nin the qualities of his mind, but of high powers of intellect, and of a\r\nnoble though arrogant and proud disposition. The epistles in verse that\r\npassed between Boscan and don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza prove the\r\nfriendship that subsisted between them, and the esteem in which Boscan\r\nwas held; at the same time they present a delightful picture of the\r\ntranquil happiness which the poet enjoyed. Mendoza's epistle is imitated\r\nfrom Horace; it is written in praise of a tranquil life. At the\r\nconclusion it describes the delights of a rural seclusion, ornamented by\r\nall the charms of nature; and he introduces his friend as enjoying these\r\nin perfection, attended on by his wife, who plucks for him the rarest\r\ngrapes and ripe fruit,--the fresh and sweet gifts of summer,--waiting on\r\nhim with diligence and joy, proud and happy in her task. Boscan, in his\r\nreply, dilates on the subject, and fills up the picture with a thousand\r\ngraces and refinements of feeling drawn from nature, and which coming\r\nwarm from the heart, reach our own.\r\n\r\nI am tempted to introduce a portion of this epistle. The fault of the\r\nSpaniards in their literature is diffuseness; I have therefore\r\nendeavoured in some degree to compress the rambling of the poet, while I\r\nsuppress no sentiment, nor introduce a new idea. Little used to\r\nversification, my translation wants smoothness; but presenting, as it\r\ndoes, a picture of domestic life, such as was passed at a distant age\r\nand in a distant land, yet resembling so nearly our own notions of the\r\npleasures of home, I think it cannot fail to interest the reader.\r\n\r\nBoscan commences, in imitation of Horace, by commending the tranquillity\r\nenjoyed in a middle station of life. He then goes on to adorn his\r\ncanvass with a picture of conjugal attachment and happiness:--\r\n\r\n\r\n'Tis peace that makes a happy life;[13]\r\nAnd that is mine through my sweet wife;\r\nBeginning of my soul and end,\r\nI've gain'd new being from this friend,--\r\nShe fills each thought, and each desire,\r\nUp to the height I would aspire.\r\nThis bliss is never found by ranging;\r\nRegret still springs from saddest changing;\r\nSuch loves and their beguiling pleasures,\r\nAre falser still than magic treasures,\r\nWhich gleam at eve with golden colour,\r\nAnd change to ashes ere the morrow.\r\nBut now each good that I possess,\r\nRooted in truth and faithfulness,\r\nImparts delight to every sense;\r\nFor erst they were a mere pretence,\r\nAnd long before enjoy'd they were,\r\nThey changed their smiles to grizly care.\r\nNow pleasures please--love being single--\r\nEvils with its delights ne'er mingle.\r\nMy bed's become a place of rest,\r\nTwo souls repose on one soft breast;\r\nAnd still in peace my simple board\r\nIs spread, and tranquil feasts afford.\r\nBefore, to eat I scarce was able,\r\nSome harpy hover'd o'er my table,\r\nSpoiling each dish when I would dine,\r\nAnd mingling gall with gladsome wine\r\nNow the content that foolish I\r\nStill miss'll in my philosophy.\r\nMy wife with tender smiles bestows,\r\nAnd makes me triumph o'er my woes;\r\nWhile with her finger she effaces\r\nOf my past folly all the traces,\r\nAnd graving pleasant thoughts instead,\r\nBids me rejoice that I am wed.\r\n* * * *\r\nAnd thus, by moderation bounded,\r\nI live by my own goods surrounded.\r\nAmong my friends, my table spread\r\nWith viands we may eat nor dread;\r\nAnd at my side my sweetest wife,\r\nWhose gentleness admits no strife,--\r\nExcept of jealousy the fear,\r\nWhose soft reproaches more endear.\r\nOur darling children round us gather,\r\nChildren who will make me grandfather.\r\nAnd thus we pass in town our days,\r\nTill the confinement something weighs;\r\nThen to our village haunt we fly,\r\nTaking some pleasant company--\r\nWhile those we love not never come\r\nAnear our rustic leafy home;\r\nFor better 'tis t' philosophise,\r\nAnd learn a lesson truly wise,\r\nFrom lowing herd and bleating flock.\r\nThan from some men of vulgar stock;\r\nAnd rustics, as they hold the plough,\r\nMay often good advice bestow.\r\nOf love, too, we may have the joy--\r\nFor Phœbus as a shepherd boy\r\nWander'd once among the clover,\r\nOf some fair shepherdess the lover;\r\nAnd Venus wept in rustic bower,\r\nAdonis turn'd to purple flower;\r\nAnd Bacchus midst the mountains derar,\r\nForgot the pangs of jealous fear;\r\nAnd nymphs that in the waters play,\r\n('Tis thus that ancient fables say),\r\nAnd dryads fair among the trees,\r\nFain the sprightly fawns would please.\r\nSo in their footsteps follow we,\r\nMy wife and I,--as fond and free,--\r\nLove in our thoughts and in our talk,\r\nDirect we slow our saunt'ring walk,\r\nTo some near murm'ring rivulet;\r\nWhere 'neath a shady beech we sit,\r\nHand clasp'd in hand, and side by side,\r\nWith some sweet kisses too beside,\r\nContending there, in combat kind,\r\nWhich best can love with constant mind.\r\nAs the stream flows among the grass,\r\nThus life's clear stream with us does pass:\r\nWe take no count of day nor night.\r\nWhile, minist'ring to our delight,\r\nNightingales all sweetly sing,\r\nAnd loving doves, with folded wing,\r\nAbove our heads are heard to coo;\r\nAnd far's the ill-betiding crow.\r\nWe do not think of cities then.\r\nNor envy the resorts of men,--\r\nOf Italy, the softer pleasures,\r\nOf Asia too, the golden treasures,\r\nAll these are nothing in our eyes;\r\nThe while a book beside us lies,\r\nWhich tells the tales of olden time,\r\nOf gods and men the hests sublime,--\r\nÆneas' voyage by Virgil told,\r\nOr song divine of Homer old,\r\nAchilles' wrath and all his glory,\r\nOr wandering Ulysses' story,\r\nPropertius too, who well indites,\r\nAnd the soft plaints Catullus writes;\r\nThese will remind me of past grief,\r\nTill, thinking of the sweet relief\r\nMy wedded state confers on me,\r\nMy bygone 'scapes I careless eye.\r\nO what are all those struggles past,\r\nThe fiery pangs which did not last,\r\nNow that I live secure for aye,\r\nIn my dear wife's sweet company?\r\nI have no reason to repine--\r\nMy joys are her's, and her's are mine;\r\nOur tranquil hearts their feelings share,\r\nAnd all our pleasures mutual are.\r\nOur eyes drink in the shady light\r\nOf wood, and vale, and grassy height;\r\nWe hear the waters as they stray,\r\nAnd from the mountains wend their way,\r\nLeaping all lightly down the steep,\r\nTill at our feet they murm'ring creep;\r\nAnd fanning us, the evening breeze,\r\nPlays gamesomely among the trees;\r\nWhile bleating flocks, as day grows cold,\r\nGladly seek their shelt'ring fold.\r\nAnd when the sun is on the hill,\r\nAnd shadows vast the valleys fill,\r\nAnd waning day, grown near its close,\r\nSends tired men to their repose;\r\nWe to our villa saunt'ring walk,\r\nAnd of the things we see we talk,\r\nOur friends come out in gayest cheer,\r\nTo welcome us--and fain would hear,\r\nIf my sweet wife be tired--and smile--\r\nInviting us to rest the while.\r\nThen to sup we take our seat,\r\nOur table plentiful and neat,\r\nOur viands without sauces drest,\r\nGood appetite the healthy zest\r\nTo fruits we've pluck'd in our own bowers,\r\nAnd gaily deck'd with od'rous flowers.\r\nAnd rustic dainties,--many a one.\r\nWhen this is o'er and supper done,\r\nThe evening passes swift along,\r\nIn converse gay and sweetest song;\r\nTill slumber, stealing to the eye,\r\nBids us to our couches hie.\r\nI will not tell what there we do,\r\nEven, dearest friend, to you;\r\nEnough that lovers ever share\r\nDelights when they together are.\r\n\r\nThus our village life we live,\r\nAnd day by day such joys receive;\r\nTill, to change the homely scene,\r\nLest it pall while too serene,\r\nTo the gay city we remove,\r\nWhere other things there are to love;\r\nAnd graced by novelty we find\r\nThe city's concourse to our mind.\r\nWhile our new coming gives a joy,\r\nWhich ever staying might destroy,\r\nWe spare all tedious compliment--\r\nYet courtesy with kind intent,\r\nWhich savage tongues alone abuse,\r\nWill often the same language use.\r\nThus in content we thankful live,\r\nAnd for one ill for which we grieve,\r\nHow much of good our dear home blesses;\r\nMortals must ever find distresses,\r\nBut sorrow loses half its weight--\r\nAnd every moment has its freight\r\nOf joy--which our dear friends impart,\r\nAnd with their kindness cheer my heart,\r\nWhile, never weary us to visit,\r\nThey seek our house when we are in it:\r\nIf we are out it gives them pain,\r\nAnd on the morrow come again.\r\nNoble Dural can cure our sadness,\r\nWith the infection of his gladness:\r\nAugustin too--well read in pages,\r\nProductions of the ancient sages,\r\nAnd the romances of our Spain--\r\nWill give us back our smiles again;\r\nWhile he with a noble gravity,\r\nAdorned by the gentlest suavity,\r\nRecounts us many a tale or fable,\r\nWhich well to tell he is most able;\r\nSerious, mingled with jokes and glee,\r\nThe which as light and shade agree.\r\nAnd Monleon, our dearest guest,\r\nWill raise our mirth by many a jest;\r\nFor while his laughter rings again,\r\nCan we to echo it refrain?\r\nAnd other merriment is ours,\r\nTo gild with joy the lightsome hours.\r\nBut all too trivial would it look,\r\nWritten down gravely in a book:\r\nAnd it is time to say adieu,\r\nThough more I have to write to you.\r\nAnother letter this shall tell,\r\nSo now, my dearest friend, farewell!\r\n\r\n\r\nThus lived Boscan, enjoying all that human nature can conceive of\r\nhappiness. One of his tasks, after the lamented death of Garcilaso, was\r\nto collect his poems, and to publish several in a volume with his own.\r\nThe date of his death is uncertain: it took place, however, before the\r\nyear 1543; so that he died comparatively young. In person he was\r\nhandsome; his physiognomy attractive from the mildness and benevolence\r\nit expressed; and his manners distinguished by courtly urbanity and\r\nelegance.\r\n\r\nAs a poet, he does not rank so high as his friend Garcilaso; he is less\r\nof a poet, less ideal, less harmonious. His chief praise results from\r\nhis coming forward as the reformer of Spanish poetry: yet he cannot be\r\nconsidered an imitator of the Italian style which he introduced. It is\r\ntrue he adopted from the Italians their versification and subjects; but\r\nnothing can be more essentially different in character and genius. The\r\ntender flow of Petrarch, the inimitable mode in which he concentrates\r\nhis ideas, and presents them to us with a precision yet with grace and\r\nideality, find no competition in Boscan's poems. But there is more\r\nsimplicity, more of the nerve of aman; less enthusiasm but a plainer and\r\ncompleter meaning in the Spaniard. He is less dreamy--to a certain\r\ndegree, more common place; but then all is true, heartfelt, and living.\r\nWe have not Petrarch's diction. Garcilaso de la Vega approached that\r\nmore nearly; but we have a full and earnest truth that carries us along\r\nwith it. Take for instance the most perfect of Petrarch's canzone,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Chiare, fresche e dolci acque,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand compare it with Boscan's\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Claros y frescos rios,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwritten in imitation. The Italian poet invests his love with ideal\r\nimagery that elevates its object into something ethereal and\r\ngoddess-like. How graceful, how full of true poetic fire and love's\r\nenthusiasm is that inimitable stanza!--\r\n\r\n\r\nStill dear to Memory! when, in odorous showers,\r\nScattering their balmy flowers\r\nTo summer airs, th' o'ershadowing branches bow'd,\r\nThe while, with humble state,\r\nIn all the pomp of tribute sweets she sate,\r\nWrapt in the roseate cloud!\r\nNow clustering blossoms deck her vesture's hem,\r\nNow her bright tresses gem\r\n(In all that blissful day,\r\nLike burnish'd gold, with orient pearls inwrought):\r\nSome strew the turf, some on the waters float!\r\nSome, fluttering, seem to say,\r\nIn wanton circlets tost, \"Here Love holds sovereign sway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBoscan's poem has nothing of the ideal creativeness which sheds a halo\r\nround its object, making one feel as if Laura fed upon different food,\r\nand had limbs of more celestial texture than other women: but Boscan's\r\nsentiments are true to nature. His tenderness is that of a real and\r\nfervent lover; without raising her whom he loves into an angel, he gives\r\nus a lively and most sweet picture of how his heart was spent upon\r\nthoughts of her; and when he tells us that during absence he meditates\r\non what she is doing, and whether she thinks of him, picturing her\r\ngesture as she laughs, thinking her thought, while his heart tells him\r\nhow she may change from gay to sad, now sleeping and now awake, there\r\nis, in the place of the ideal, sincerity,--in place of the wanderings of\r\nfancy, the fixed earnestness of a fond and manly heart.\r\n\r\nBoscan imitated Horace as well as Petrarch. In the epistle from which a\r\npassage has been quoted, he abides by the unornamented style of the\r\nLatin poet; but he wants his terseness, his epigrammatic turns, his keen\r\nobservation. His poem is descriptive, and sweetly so, of the best state\r\nof man,--that of a happy marriage; but while he presents a faithful\r\npicture of its tranquil virtuous pleasures, and imparts the deep serene\r\njoy of his own heart, his hues are not stolen from the rainbow, nor his\r\nmusic from the spheres: it is all calm, earthly, unidealised, though not\r\nunimpassioned.\r\n\r\nOne fault Boscan possesses in common with almost all other Spanish\r\npoets--he cannot compress: he runs on, one idea suggesting another, one\r\nline the one to follow in artless unconstrained flow; but his poetry\r\nwants concentration and energy. You read with pleasure, and follow the\r\nmeanders of his thoughts; they are not wild, but they are desultory; and\r\nwe are never startled as when reading Petrarch, by the rising, as it\r\nwere, amidst melodious sounds, of some structure of ideal and surpassing\r\nbeauty, which makes you pause, imbibe the whole conception of the poet,\r\nand exclaim, This is perfection!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote

interesting man, a hero, both in love and\r\nwar, whose name seems to embody the perfect idea of Spanish chivalry,\r\nwas Boscan's friend, Garcilaso de la Vega. We possess a translation of\r\nhis poetry by Mr. Wiffen, who has appended an elaborate life, as\r\nelaborate at least as the scanty materials that remain could afford; for\r\nthese are slight, and rather to be guessed at from slight allusions made\r\nby historians, and expressions in his poems, than from certain\r\nknowledge; as all that we really learn concerning him is, that he was a\r\ngallant soldier and a poet, devoting the leisure he could snatch from\r\nthe hurry and alarm of war, to the study and composition of poetry, in\r\nwhich art he attained the name of prince, and is, indeed, superior to\r\nall the writers of his age in elegance, sweetness, and pathos.\r\n\r\nGarcilaso de la Vega was sprung from one of the noblest families of\r\nToledo. His ancestry is illustrious in Spanish chronicles. They were\r\noriginally natives of the Asturias, and, possessing great wealth,\r\narrived at high honours under various sovereigns. One of them, by name\r\nalso Garcilaso, received the name of De la Vega, in commemoration of his\r\nhaving slain a gigantic Moor on the Vega or plain of Granada.[14] The\r\nmiscreant having attached the Ave Maria to his horse's tail, all the\r\nknights of Spain were eager to avenge the injury done to our lady.\r\nAlthough a mere youth, Garcilaso triumphed, and was surnamed in\r\nconsequence De la Vega, and adopted for his device the Ave Maria in a\r\nfield d'or. The father of the poet, named also Garcilaso, was fourth\r\nlord of Los Anos, grand commendary of Leon, a knight of the order of St.\r\nJames, one of the most distinguished gentlemen of the court of Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella. His mother was donna Sancha de Toral, an heiress of a\r\nlarge estate in Leon,--a demesne, it would seem, where the poet passed\r\nhis earlier days; for the fountain which ornaments it still goes by his\r\nname, and is supposed to be described in his second eclogue.[15] These\r\neclogues were written at Naples; it may, therefore, be a piece of fond\r\npatriotism in the Spaniard, that attributes this description to a\r\nfountain in his native woods; but there is a pleasure in figuring the\r\nboy-poet loitering beside its pure waters, and so filling his\r\nimagination with images presented by its limpid waves and the\r\nsurrounding scenery, that, in after years and in a foreign country, he\r\ncould fondly dwell upon and reproduce them in his verse.\r\n\r\nGarcilaso was born at Toledo in 1503, being a few years younger than the\r\nemperor Charles V. When, on his accession to the throne, that prince\r\nvisited the Spain he was called by right of birth to reign over,\r\nGarcilaso was only fifteen. We are told, however, that his skill in\r\nmartial and gymnastic exercises made him early a favourite with his\r\nsovereign, and he soon entered on that warlike career destined to prove\r\nfatal to him. His poetic tastes, also, were developed while still a\r\nyouth. He was passionately fond of music, and played with extreme\r\nsweetness on the harp and guitar.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Charles V. was signalised in Spain by disaster. The\r\ndeath of cardinal Ximenes deprived the youthful sovereign of his most\r\nillustrious counsellor, though perhaps of one he would have neglected.\r\nHis Flemish courtiers attained undue influence, and a nefarious system\r\nof peculation was carried on,--the treasures of Spain being exported to\r\nFlanders, which the Spaniards regarded with alarm and indignation. The\r\nelection of Charles to the imperial crown and his intended departure for\r\nGermany was the signal of resistance. This is the more deserving of\r\ncommemoration in these pages, as the elder brother of Garcilaso took a\r\ndistinguished part on the popular side.[16] He was candidate for the\r\ndistinction of captain-general of the Germanada or Brotherhood (an\r\nassociation, at first sanctioned by Charles, for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining the privileges of the people), and even elected such, till a\r\npopular revolt reversed his nomination in favour of the heroic Padilla.\r\nNot less heroic, however, was don Pedro, and in the cortes he boldly\r\nconfronted the king, and declared that he would sooner be cut in pieces,\r\nsooner lose his head, than yield the good of his country to the\r\nsovereign's arbitrary will. Of such gallant stuff was the Spanish\r\ncourtier made, till Charles's wars drained the country of her most\r\nvaliant spirits, and the cruel share of the Inquisition ploughed up, and\r\nas it were sowed with salt, the soil, originally so fertile in genius\r\nand heroism. Don Pedro remained true to his cause to the last, though he\r\ndid not carry his views so far as Padilla; and thus escaped the\r\nmartyrdom of this generous patriot. The conduct of Charles in publishing\r\na general pardon, on his return to Spain, is among the few instances he\r\nhas given of magnanimity. His reply to a courtier who offered to inform\r\nhim where one of the rebels lay concealed, deserves repetition from the\r\ngrandeur of soul it expressed. \"I have now no reason,\" he said, \"to be\r\nafraid of that man, but he has cause to shun me; you would do better,\r\ntherefore, in telling him that I am here, than in informing me of the\r\nplace of his retreat.\"\r\n\r\nWar being soon after declared against France, Italy became the seat of\r\nthe struggle. Garcilaso, though little more than eighteen, commenced his\r\ncareer of arms in this campaign. He was present at the battle of Pavia,\r\nand so distinguished himself, that he shortly after received the cross\r\nof St. Jago from the emperor in reward of his valour.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, that after this battle Garcilaso returned for a time to\r\nhis native country. Since it was soon after, that Boscan, falling in\r\nwith Andrea Navagero, ambassador from Venice to the Spanish court, in\r\n1525, resolved on imitating the Italian poetry--as is recorded in his\r\nlife,--and Garcilaso was his adviser and supporter. At the age of\r\nfour-and-twenty, in the year 1528, he married Doña Elena de Zuniga, a\r\nlady of Arragon, maid of honour to Leonora, queen of France,--a happy\r\nmarriage--from which sprung three sons.\r\n\r\nOn the invasion of Hungary by Solyman, in 1532, the emperor repaired to\r\nVienna to undertake the war in person. The campaign was carried on\r\nwithout any action of moment; but Garcilaso was engaged in various\r\nskirmishes, and saw enough of war to fill him with horror at its\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, he fell into disgrace at court. One of his\r\ncousins, a son of don Pedro Lasso, aspired clandestinely to the hand of\r\ndonna Isabel, daughter of don Luis de la Cueva, maid of honour to the\r\nempress. We are ignorant of the reason wherefore Charles was opposed to\r\nthis marriage, and the consequent necessity of carrying on the amour\r\nsecretly. Garcilaso befriended the lovers. The intrigue being\r\ndiscovered, the emperor was highly incensed; he banished the cousin, and\r\nexiled Garcilaso to an island of the Danube, an imprisonment which he\r\ncommemorates in an ode, of which we may quote some stanzas from Mr.\r\nWiffen's translation, which characterise the disposition of the man; no\r\ncourtier or man of the world he, repining at disgrace and\r\ndisappointment; but a poet, ready to find joy in solitude, and to adorn\r\nadversity with the rainbow hues of the imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"TO THE DANUBE.\r\n\r\nWith the mild sound of clear swift waves, the Danube's arms of foam\r\nCircle a verdant isle which peace has made her chosen home;\r\nWhere the fond poet might repair from weariness and strife,\r\nAnd in the sunshine of sweet song consume his happy life.\r\nHere evermore the smiling spring goes scattering odorous flowers,\r\nAnd nightingales and turtle doves, in depth of myrtle bowers,\r\nTurn disappointment into hope, turn sadness to delight,\r\nWith magic of their fond laments, which cease not day nor night.\r\nHere am I placed, or sooth to say, alone, 'neath foreign skies,\r\nForced in arrest, and easy 'tis in such a paradise\r\nTo force a meditative man, whose own desires would doom\r\nHimself with pleasure to a world all redolence and bloom.\r\nOne thought alone distresses me, if I whilst banished sink\r\n'Midst such misfortunes to the grave, lest haply they should think\r\nIt was my complicated ills that caused my death, while I\r\nKnow well that if I die 'twill be because I wish to die.\r\n* * * * *\r\nRiver divine, rich Danube! thou the bountiful and strong,\r\nThat through fierce nations roll'st thy waves rejoicingly along,\r\nSince only but by rushing through thy drowning billows deep,\r\nThese scrolls can hence escape to tell the noble words I weep.\r\nIf wrecked in undeciphered loss on some far foreign land,\r\nThey should by any chance be found upon the desert sand,\r\nSince they upon thy willowed shore must drift, where'er they are,\r\nTheir relics let the kind blue waves with murmured hymns inter.\r\nOde of my melancholy hours! last infant of my lyre!\r\nAlthough in booming waves it be thy fortune to expire,\r\nGrieve not, since I, howe'er from holy rites debarred,\r\nHave seen to all that touches thee with catholic regard.\r\nLess, less had been thy life, if thou hadst been but ranked among\r\nThose without record, that have risen and died upon my tongue;\r\nWhose utter want of sympathy, and haughtiness austere.\r\nHas been the cause of this--from me thou very soon shalt hear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not known how long his exile endured, but certainly not long; he\r\nwas recalled, and attended the emperor in his expedition against Tunis.\r\n\r\nThe son of a potter of Lesbos, turning corsair, raised himself to notice\r\nand power under the name of Barbarossa. He possessed himself of Algiers\r\nby treachery, and then, protected by the grand signor, he attacked\r\nTunis, and drove out the king Muley Hassan. Muley solicited the aid of\r\nthe emperor, and Charles, animated by a desire to punish a pirate whose\r\ncruelties had desolated many a Christian family, put himself at the head\r\nof an armament to invade Tunis. Barbarossa exerted himself to defend the\r\ncity, and, in particular, fortified the citadel, named Goletta, and\r\ngarrisoned it with 6000 Turks. Immediately on landing, the emperor\r\ninvested the city; sallies and skirmishes became frequent, in one of\r\nwhich Garcilaso was wounded in the face and hand. Goletta fell, despite\r\nthe vigorous defence; but Barbarossa did not despair: he assembled an\r\narmy of 150,000 men, and, confiding in numbers, resolved to offer battle\r\nto the Christians. Garcilaso served on this occasion in a division of\r\nthe imperial army, commanded by the marquis de Mondejar, a division at\r\nfirst left as a rear guard, but ordered afterwards to advance to support\r\nsome newly raised Spanish regiments commanded by the duke of Alva. The\r\nmarquis de Mondejar was badly wounded and carried from the field;\r\nGarcilaso, seeing the danger to which the troops were exposed in the\r\nabsence of the general, rushed forward to support them by the example of\r\nhis valour. His gallantry had nearly proved fatal: he was wounded and\r\nsurrounded, and must have been slain, but for a Neapolitan noble,\r\nFederigo Carafa, who rescued him at the peril of his life. By great\r\nefforts he succeeded in dispersing the multitude, and bore him back in\r\nsafety, half spent with toil, thirst, and loss of blood.[17] The day\r\nended in the defeat of Barbarossa; Muley Hassan was restored to his\r\nthrone; and Charles returned to Italy in triumph.\r\n\r\nAfter this expedition, Garcilaso spent some time at Naples and Sicily.\r\nDuring his residence there, he is said to have written his eclogues and\r\nelegies, which are the most beautiful of his poems. There is something\r\nso truly poetic in the site, the clime, the atmosphere of Naples, that\r\nthe most prosaic spirit must feel its influence. There Petrarch was\r\nexamined by king Robert, and declared worthy of the laurel crown; there\r\nhe delivered that oration on poetry that won the king to admire the\r\nheretofore neglected art, and inspired the young Boccaccio with that\r\nenthusiastic love for the Muses, which lasted to his dying day. There\r\n(and Garcilaso seems to have felt deeply the influence of these poets)\r\nVirgil and Sannazar wrote. The Spanish poet particularly loved and\r\nadmired Virgil. Imbued by his spirit, he emulated his elegance and\r\nharmony, while he surpassed him in tender pathos.\r\n\r\nOne of his elegies to Boscan is dated from the foot of Etna. It does not\r\nrank among the best of his poems; but it is agreeable to preserve proofs\r\nof friendship between these gifted men. It a little jars, however, with\r\nour feelings, that he in it alludes to some lady of his love, though he\r\nwas now married; however, there is a sort of poetic imaginative hue\r\nthrown over this elegy, which permits us to attribute his love\r\ncomplaints rather to the memory of past times and the poetic\r\ntemperament, than to inconstancy of disposition. Garcilaso's poetry is\r\nrefined and pure in all its sentiments, though full, at the same time,\r\nof tenderness. I subjoin a few stanzas from the elegy in question, such\r\nas give individuality and interest to the character of the poet:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Boscan! here where the Mantuan has inurned\r\nAnchises' ashes to eternal fame,\r\nWe, Cæsar's hosts, from conquests are returned;\r\nSome of their toils the promised fruit to claim--\r\nSome to make virtue both the end and aim\r\nOf action,--or would have the world suppose\r\nAnd say so, loud in public to declaim\r\nAgainst such selfishness; whilst yet heaven knows\r\nThey act in secret all the meanness they oppose.\r\n\r\nFor me, a happy medium I observe,\r\nFor never has it entered in my scheme,\r\nTo strive for much more silver than may serve\r\nTo lift me gracefully from each extreme\r\nOf thrifty meanness, thriftless pride; I deem\r\nThe men contemptible that stoop to use\r\nThe one or other, that delight to seem\r\nToo close, or inconsiderate in their views:\r\nIn error's moonlight maze their way both worthies find.\r\n* * * *\r\nYet leave I not the Muses, but the more\r\nFor this perplexity with them commune,\r\nAnd with the charm of their delicious love\r\nVary my life, and waste the summer noon;\r\nThus pass my hours beguiled; but out of tune\r\nThe lyre will sometimes be, when trials prove\r\nThe anxious lyrist: to the country soon\r\nOf the sweet Siren shall I hence remove,\r\nYet, as of yore, the land of idlesse, ease, and love.\r\n* * * *\r\nBut how, O how shall I be sure, that here\r\nMy evil genius, in the change I seek,\r\nIs not still sworn against me? this strong fear\r\nIt is that chills my heart, and renders weak\r\nThe wish I feel to visit that antique\r\nItalian city, whence my eyes derive\r\nSuch exquisite delight, with tears they speak\r\nOf the contrasting griefs my heart that rive;\r\nAnd with them up in arms against me here I strive.\r\n\r\nO fierce--O rigorous--O remorseless Mars!\r\nIn diamond tunic garmented, and so\r\nSteeled always in the harshness that debars\r\nThe soul from feeling! wherefore as a foe\r\nForce the fond lover evermore to go\r\nOnward from strife to strife, o'er land and sea?\r\nExerting all thy power to work me woe,\r\nI am so far reduced, that death would be\r\nAt length a blessed boon, my refuge, fiend, from thee!\r\n\r\nBut my hard fate this blessing does deny;\r\nI meet it not in battle; the strong spear,\r\nSharp sword, and piercing arrow pass me by,\r\nYet strike down others in their young career,\r\nThat I might pine away to see my dear\r\nSweet fruit engrossed by aliens, who deride\r\nMy vain distress; but whither does my fear\r\nAnd grief transport me, without shame or pride?\r\nWhither I dread to think, and grieve to have descried.\r\n* * * *\r\nBut thou who in thy villa, blest with all\r\nThat heart can wish, look'st on the sweet sea-shore;\r\nAnd, undistracted, listening to the fall\r\nAnd swell of the loud waves that round thee roar,\r\nGatherest to thy already rich scrutoire\r\nFresh living verses for perpetual fame,\r\nRejoice! for fires more beauteous than of yore\r\nWere kindled by the Dardan prince, inflame\r\nThy philosophic heart, and light thy laurelled name.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed, that the learned Italians of those days welcomed a\r\nspirit congenial to their own, and were proud of a poet who transferred\r\nto another language that elegance of style and elevated purity of\r\nthought, the original growth of their native land. Cardinal Bembo thus\r\nwrites of him to a friend, in a letter dated 15th of August,\r\n1535:--\"Signor Garcilaso is indeed a graceful poet, and his odes are all\r\nin the highest degree pleasing to me, and merit peculiar admiration and\r\npraise. In fine spirit he has far excelled all the writers of his\r\nnation; and if he be not wanting to himself in diligent study, he will\r\nno less excel other nations who are considered masters of poetry. I am\r\nnot surprised that the marquis del Vasto has wished to have him with\r\nhim, and that he holds him in great affection.\"\r\n\r\nAmong cardinal Bembo's Latin letters, there is one to Garcilaso, full of\r\ncompliments, which show the high esteem in which he was held. \"From the\r\nverses which you have sent me, I am happy to perceive, first, how much\r\nyou love me, since you are not one who would else flatter with\r\nencomiums, nor call one dear to you whom you have never seen; and,\r\nsecondly, how much you excel in lyric compositions, in splendour of\r\ngenius, and sweetness of expression.--You have not only surpassed all\r\nyour fellow Spaniards, who have devoted themselves to Parnassus and the\r\nMuses, but you supply incentives even to the Italians, and again and\r\nagain invite them to endeavour to be overcome in this contest and in\r\nthese studies by no one but yourself; which judgment of mine some other\r\nof your writings sent to me from Naples have confirmed. For it is\r\nimpossible to meet in this age with compositions more classically pure,\r\nmore dignified in sentiment, or more elegant in style. In that you love\r\nme, therefore, I most justly and sincerely rejoice; and that you are a\r\ngreat and good man, I congratulate in the first place yourself, but most\r\nof all, your country, in that she is thus about to receive so great an\r\nincrease of honour and glory.\r\n\r\n\"There is, however, another circumstance which greatly increases the\r\nhonour I have received; for lately, when the monk Onorato, whom I\r\nperceive you know by reputation, entered into conversation with me, and,\r\namongst other topics, asked me what I thought of your poems, the opinion\r\nI gave happened to coincide exactly with his own; and he is a man of\r\nvery acute perception, and extremely well versed in poetical pursuits.\r\nHe told me that his friends had written to him of your very many and\r\ngreat virtues, of the urbanity of your manners, the integrity of your\r\nlife, and accomplishments of your mind; adding that it was a fact\r\nconfirmed by all Neapolitans that knew you, that no one had come from\r\nSpain to their city in these times, wherein the greatest resort has been\r\nmade by your nation to Italy, whom they loved more affectionately than\r\nyourself, or one on whom they would confer superior benefits.\"\r\n\r\nGarcilaso did not, however, long enjoy the leisure that he so well\r\nemployed. Charles V., whose great ambition was to crush the power of\r\nFrance, and to possess himself of a portion of that kingdom, was\r\nresolved to take advantage of the disastrous issue of Francis I.'s\r\nattempt upon the duchy of Milan, and rashly determined to invade a\r\ncountry whose armies, however he might meet victoriously in other\r\nfields, he could not hope to vanquish in their own. He entered France\r\nfrom the south; and recalling Garcilaso, conferred on him an honourable\r\ncommand over eleven companies of infantry. Leaving Naples to join this\r\nexpedition, he traversed Italy, and from Vaucluse wrote an epistle to\r\nBoscan in a fighter and gayer style than is usual with him; while he\r\ndwells with affectionate pleasure on the the of friendship that united\r\nthem, saying, among other things,--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Whilst much reflecting on the sacred tie\r\nOf our affection, which I hold so high,\r\nThe exchange of talent, taste, intelligence,\r\nShared gifts and multiplied delights which thence\r\nRefresh our souls in their perpetual flow--\r\nThere nothing is that makes me value so\r\nThe sweetness of this compact of the heart,\r\nThan the affection on my own warm part.\r\n* * * *\r\nSuch were my thoughts. But oh! how shall I set\r\nFully to view my shame and my regret,\r\nFor having praised so at a single glance,\r\nThe roads, the dealings, and hotels of France.\r\nShame, that with reason thou may'st now pronounce\r\nMyself a fabler, and my praise a bounce;\r\nRegret, my time so much to have misused,\r\nIn rashly lauding what were best abused;\r\nFor here, all fibs apart, you find but jades\r\nOf hacks, sour wines, and pilfering chambermaids,\r\nLong ways, long bills, no silver, fleecing hosts.\r\nAnd all the luxury of lumbering posts.\r\nArriving too from Naples by the way--\r\nNaples--the choice, the brilliant, and the gay!\r\nEmbrace Dural for me--nor rate my muse;\r\nOctober twelfth, given forth from sweet Vaucluse,\r\nWhere the fine flame of Petrarch had its birth,\r\nAnd where its ashes yet irradiate earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the period of this campaign Wiffen is inclined to attribute the\r\ncomposition of his third eclogue which, in point of merit, is the\r\nsecond, and which was avowedly written during a war--for, as he says,--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Midst arms--with scarce one pause from bloody toil,\r\nWhen war's hoarse trumpet breaks the poet's dream,\r\nHave I there moments stolen, oft claimed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis expedition was disastrous in itself and fatal to the poet. An\r\ninvading army is necessarily abhorred by all; and while it inflicts,\r\nalso suffers the utmost horrors of war. The French general wisely acted\r\non the defensive, and, having laid the country waste, left famine and\r\ndisease to win the game. The emperor, unsuccessful in his attempts upon\r\nMarseilles and Arles, was obliged to retreat through a country roused to\r\nexasperation by the ills it had endured. His army, in consequence, was\r\nexposed to a thousand disasters, while the very peasants, hanging on its\r\nrear, or lying in ambush, cut off the stragglers, and disputed the\r\npassage of every defile. On one occasion, at Muy near Frejus, the\r\nimperialists were held in check by a party of fifty rustics, who, armed\r\nwith muskets, had thrown themselves into a tower, and harassed them on\r\ntheir passage. The emperor ordered Garcilaso to attack and carry it with\r\nhis battalion. Eager in his obedience, Garcilaso led the way to scale\r\nthe tower. The peasants observing that he wore a gaily embroidered dress\r\nover his armour, fancied that it was the emperor himself, and marked him\r\nout for destruction. He was the first to mount the ladder; a block of\r\nstone rolled from the battlements, struck him on the head and beat him\r\nto the ground. He was carried to Nice; but no care could avail to save\r\nhim: he lingered for twenty days, and then died, November, 1536, at the\r\nage only of thirty-three. He showed, we are told, no less the spirit of\r\na Christian in his death, than of a soldier in the hour of peril. His\r\ndeath was universally lamented; and the emperor displayed his sense of\r\nthe loss he had sustained, by causing all the peasants who survived the\r\ntaking of the tower, twenty-eight in number, to be hanged. Such a token\r\nof respect would scarcely soothe the ghost of the gentle poet; but it\r\nwas in accordance with the spirit of the times. The body was interred at\r\nfirst in the church of Saint Dominique at Nice; but two years afterwards\r\nwas removed to the tomb of his ancestors in a chapel of the church of\r\nSan Pedro Martyr de Toledo.\r\n\r\nGarcilaso is always represented as the model of a young and gallant\r\nsoldier, adorning his knightly accomplishments with the softer graces of\r\na poet; as an imaginative enthusiast, joining sentiment to passion, and\r\nsoftening both by the elegancies of refinement. His tall figure was\r\nsymmetrical in its proportions, and his mien was dignified. There was a\r\nmingled seriousness and mildness in the expression of his face,\r\nenlivened by sparkling eyes, and dignified by an expansive forehead. He\r\nwas a favourite with the ladies, while he enjoyed the friendship and\r\nesteem of many excellent men. Wiffen takes pleasure in adopting the idea\r\nof doctor Nott, and likening him to our noble poet, lord Surrey. He\r\nleft, orphaned by his death, three sons and a daughter. His eldest son\r\nincurred a similar fate with himself. He enjoyed the favour of the\r\nemperor, but fell at the battle of Ulpiano, at the early age of\r\ntwenty-four. His second son, Francisco de Guzman, became a monk, and\r\nenjoyed a reputation as a great theologian. The youngest Lorenzo de\r\nGuzman, inherited a portion of his father's genius, and was esteemed for\r\nhis talent. He scarcely made a good use of it, since he was banished to\r\nOran for a lampoon, and died on the passage. The only daughter of the\r\npoet, donna Sancha de Guzman, married D. Antonio Portocarrero de Vega.\r\n\r\nWe turn, however, to Garcilaso's poetry as his best memorial and highest\r\nmerit, at least that merit which gives him a place in these pages. When\r\nwe remember that he died at thirty-three, we must regard his productions\r\nrather in the light of promise, than of performance. His muse might have\r\nsoared higher, and taken some new path: as it is, he ranks high as an\r\nelegiac poet, and the first that Spain has produced. The most perfect of\r\nhis poems is his second eclogue. Mr. Wiffen has succeeded admirably in\r\ntransfusing, in some of the stanzas, a portion of the pathos and\r\nsoftness of the original. Emulating Virgil in his refinement and\r\ndignity, Garcilaso surpassed him in tenderness; and certainly the\r\nexpression of regret and grief was never more affectingly and sweetly\r\nexpressed than in the laments that compose this eclogue.\r\n\r\nThe poem commences with the poet speaking in his own person. He\r\nintroduces the personages of the eclogue: Salicio, who laments the\r\ninfidelity of his lady; and Nemeroso, who mourns the death of his. It is\r\nsupposed that, under the name of Salicio, Garcilaso personifies himself,\r\nand commemorates the feelings which he experienced, when suffering from\r\nthe inconstancy of a lady whom he loved in his youth.\r\n\r\nNothing can exceed the living tenderness of the deserted shepherd's\r\ncomplaints; and we feel as if the tone of fond grief could go no\r\nfurther, till the interest becomes heightened by the more touching\r\nnature of Nemoroso's laments: under this name it is said that Garcilaso\r\nintroduced Boscan. Boscan was a happy husband and father. In his epistle\r\nto Mendoza, he mentions his former passions as a troubled dream, where\r\nall seemed love, but was really hate; and he does not allude to the\r\ndeath of any object of his affections. Mr. Wiffen, with the natural\r\nfondness of a translator and an antiquarian, delights in putting\r\ntogether the scattered and half lost fragments of his poet's life, and\r\nto eke out the history of his mind by probable conjecture, and is\r\ninclined to believe that Boscan was intended, and that being dear\r\nfriends, Garcilaso pleased his imagination and heart, in making them\r\nbrother shepherds in his verses. It is an agreeable idea, and not\r\nimprobable: the reader may believe according as his inclinations leads\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut not to linger longer on preliminary matter, we select the most\r\nbeautiful stanzas of the eclogue, which will confirm to the Spanish\r\nreader the opinion that Garcilaso is the most harmonious, easy, elegant,\r\nand tender poet Spain ever produced: soft and melancholy, he never errs,\r\nexcept in sometimes following the fashion of his country in reasoning on\r\nhis feelings, instead of simply declaring them. Such fault, however, is\r\nnot to be found in the following verses, wherein Salicio complains of\r\nhis Galatea's inconstancy, recalling the while the dear images of her\r\nformer tenderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Through thee the silence of the shaded glen,[18]\r\nThrough thee the horror of the lonely mountain,\r\nPleased me no less than the resort of men:\r\nThe breeze, the summer wood, the lucid fountain,\r\nThe purple rose, white lily of the lake,\r\nWere sweet for thy sweet sake;\r\nFor thee, the fragrant primrose, dropt with dew,\r\nWas wished when first it blew.\r\nO how completely was I in all this\r\nMyself deceiving! O the different part\r\nThat thou wert acting, covering with a kiss\r\nOf seeming love, the traitor in thy heart!\r\nThis my severe misfortune, long ago,\r\nDid the soothsaying raven, sailing by\r\nOn the black-storm, with hoarse sinister cry,\r\nClearly presage: in gentleness of woe\r\nFlow forth, my tears! 't is meet that ye should flow.\r\n\r\nHow oft when slumbering in the forest brown,\r\n(Deeming it fancy's mystical deceit)\r\nHave I beheld my fate in dreams foreshown!\r\nOne day, methought that from the noontide heat\r\nI drove my flocks to drink of Tagus' flood,\r\nAnd, under the curtain of its bordering wood\r\nTake my cool siesta; but, arrived, the stream,\r\nI know not by what magic, changed its track,\r\nAnd in new channels, by an unused way,\r\nRolled its warped waters back;\r\nWhilst I, scorched, melting with the heat extreme,\r\nWent ever following in their flight astray,\r\nThe wizard waves: in gentleness of woe,\r\nFlow forth, my tears!'t is meet that ye should flow.\r\nIn the charmed ear of what beloved youth,\r\nSounds thy sweet voice? On whom revolvest thou\r\nThy beautiful blue eyes? On whose proved truth\r\nAnchors thy broken faith? Who presses now\r\nThy laughing lip, and takes thy heaven of charms\r\nLocked in the embraces of thy two white arms?\r\nSay thou, for whom hast thou so rudely left\r\nMy love, or stolen, who triumphs in the theft?\r\nI have not got a bosom so untrue\r\nTo feeling, nor a heart of stone, to view\r\nMy darling ivy, torn from me, take root\r\nAgainst another wall, or prosperous pine,--\r\nTo see my virgin vine\r\nAround another elm in marriage hang\r\nIts curling tendrils and empurpled fruit,\r\nWithout the torture of a jealous pang,\r\nEv'n to the loss of life: in gentle woe,\r\nFlow forth, my tears; 't is meet that ye should flow.\r\n* * * *\r\nOver my griefs the mossy stones relent\r\nTheir natural durity, and break; the trees\r\nBend down their weeping boughs without a breeze;\r\nAnd full of tenderness the listening birds,\r\nWarbling in different notes, with me lament.\r\nAnd warbling prophesy my death; the herds\r\nThat in the green meads hang their heads at eve,\r\nWearied, and worn, and faint,\r\nThe necessary sweets of slumber leave,\r\nAnd low, and listen to my wild complaint.\r\nThou only steel'st thy bosom to my cries,\r\nNot even once turning thy angelic eyes\r\nOn him thy harshness kills: in gentle woe\r\nFlow forth, my tears! 'tis meet that ye should flow.\r\nBut though thou wilt not come for my sad sake,\r\nLeave not the landscape thou hast held so dear,\r\nThou may'st come freely now, without the fear\r\nOf meeting me, for though my heart should break,\r\nWhere late forsaken, I will now forsake.\r\nCome then, if this alone detain thee, here\r\nAre meadows full of verdure, myrtles, bays,\r\nWoodlands and lawns, and running waters clear,\r\nBeloved in other days,\r\nTo which, bedewed with many a bitter tear,\r\nI sing my last of lays.\r\nThese scenes, perhaps, when I am far removed,\r\nAt ease thou wilt frequent\r\nWith him who rifled me of all I loved:\r\nEnough, my strength is spent;\r\nAnd leaving thee in his desired embrace,\r\nIt is not much to leave him this sweet place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impatience natural to the resentment of inconstancy ruffles though\r\nit does not distort these sweet stanzas. But there is more of soft\r\nmelancholy in Nemoroso, more of the entire melting of the heart in sad\r\nunavailing regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Smooth, sliding waters, pure and crystalline,[19]\r\nTrees that reflect your image in their breast\r\nGreen pastures, full of fountains and fresh shades,\r\nBirds, that here scatter your sweet serenades;\r\nMosses and reverend ivies serpentine,\r\nThat wreath your verdurous arms round beech and pine,\r\nAnd, climbing, crown their crest!\r\nCan I forget, ere grief my spirit changed,\r\nWith what delicious ease and pure content,\r\nYour peace I wooed, your solitudes I ranged,\r\nEnchanted and refreshed where'er I went!\r\nHow many blissful noons here I have spent\r\nIn luxury of slumber, couched on flowers,\r\nAnd with my own fond fancies, from a boy,\r\nDiscoursed away the hours,\r\nDiscovering nought in your delightful bowers,\r\nBut golden dreams, and memories fraught with joy.\r\n* * *\r\nWhere are those eloquent mild eyes, which drew\r\nMy heart where'er it wandered? where the hand,\r\nWhite, delicate, and pure as melting dew,\r\nFilled with the spoils, that proud of thy command,\r\nMy feelings paid in tribute? the bright hair\r\nThat paled the shining gold, that did contemn\r\nThe glorious opal as a meaner gem,\r\nThe bosom's ivory apples, where, ah! where?\r\nWhere now the neck to whiteness overwrought,\r\nThat like a column with genteelest scorn\r\nSustained the golden dome of virtuous thought?\r\nGone! ah, for ever gone,\r\nTo the chill desolate and dreary pall,\r\nAnd mine the grief--the wormwood and the gall!\r\n* * *\r\nPoor, lost Eliza! of thy locks of gold,\r\nOne treasured ringlet in white silk I keep\r\nFor ever at my heart, which, when unrolled,\r\nFresh grief and pity o'er my spirit creep;\r\nAnd my insatiate eyes, for hours untold.\r\nO'er the dear pledge, will like an infant's, weep.\r\nWith sighs more warm than fire anon I dry\r\nThe tears from off it, number one by one\r\nThe radiant hairs, and with a love-knot tie;\r\nMine eyes, this duty done,\r\nGive over weeping, and with slight relief\r\nI taste a short forgetfulness of grief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this quotation has run to a great lengthy I cannot refrain from\r\nadding the ode to the Flower of Gnido. It is more fanciful and airy,\r\nmore original, yet more classic. Mr. Wiffen's translation also is very\r\ncorrect and beautiful, failing only in not preserving all the exquisite\r\nsimplicity of the original; but that is a charm difficult indeed to\r\ntransfer from one language to another. Of the subject of the ode we\r\nreceive the following account from the commentators. \"The title of this\r\node is derived from a quarter of a city of Naples called Il Seggio di\r\nGnido, or the seat of Gnido, the favourite abode then of the people of\r\nfashion, in which also the lady lived, to whom the ode was addressed.\r\nThis lady. Violante San Severino, a daughter of the duke of Soma, was\r\ncourted by Fabio Galeota, a friend of Garcilaso in whose behalf the poem\r\nwas written.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"TO THE FLOWER OF GNIDO.[20]\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nHad I the sweet resounding lyre,\r\nWhose voice could in a moment chain\r\nThe howling wind's ungoverned ire,\r\nAnd movement of the raging main,\r\nOn savage hills the leopard rein,\r\nThe lion's fiery soul entrance,\r\nAnd lead along with golden tones\r\nThe fascinated trees and stones\r\nIn voluntary dance;\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThink not, think not, fair Flower of Gnide,\r\nIt e'er should celebrate the scars,\r\nDust raised, blood shed, and laurels dyed\r\nBeneath the gonfalon of Mars;\r\nOr, borne sublime on festal cars,\r\nThe chiefs who to submission sank\r\nThe rebel German's soul of soul,\r\nAnd forged the chains that now control\r\nThe frenzy of the Frank.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nNo, no! its harmonies should ring,\r\nIn vaunt of glories all thine own,\r\nA discord sometimes from the string\r\nStruck forth to make thy harshness known.\r\nThe fingered chords should speak alone\r\nOf Beauty's triumphs, Love's alarms,\r\nAnd one who, made by thy disdain\r\nBale as a lily dipt in twain.\r\nBewails thy fatal charms.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nOf that poor captive, too contemned,\r\nI speak,--his doom you might deplore--\r\nIn Venus' galliot shell condemned\r\nTo strain for life the heavy oar.\r\nThrough thee, no longer as of yore,\r\nHe tames the unmanageable steed,\r\nWith curb of gold his pride restrains,\r\nOr with pressed spurs and shaken reins\r\nTorments him into speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nNot now he wields, for thy sweet sake,\r\nThe sword in his accomplished hand;\r\nNor grapples like a poisonous snake,\r\nThe wrestler on the yellow sand:\r\nThe old heroic harp his hand\r\nConsults not now; it can but kiss\r\nThe amorous lute's dissolving strings.\r\nWhich murmur forth a thousand things\r\nOf banishment from bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThrough thee, my dearest friend and best\r\nGrows harsh, importunate, and grave;\r\nMyself have been his port of rest,\r\nFrom shipwreck on the yawning wave;\r\nYet now so high his passions rave\r\nAbove lost reason's conquered laws,\r\nThat not the traveller ere he slays\r\nThe asp, its sting, as he my face\r\nSo dreads, and so abhors.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nIn snows on rocks, sweet Flower of Gnide,\r\nThou wert not cradled, wert not born;\r\nShe who has not a fault beside,\r\nShould ne'er be signalised for scorn;\r\nElse tremble at the fate forlorn\r\nOf Anaxarete, who spurned\r\nThe weeping Iphis from her gate;\r\nWho, scoffing long, relenting late,\r\nWas to a statue turned.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nWhilst yet soft pity she repelled,\r\nWhilst yet she steeled her heart in pride,\r\nFrom her friezed window she beheld,\r\nAghast, the lifeless suicide.\r\nAround his lily neck was tied,\r\nWhat freed his spirit from her chains,\r\nAnd purchased with a few short sighs,\r\nFor her immortal agonies,\r\nImperishable pains.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nThen first she felt her bosom bleed\r\nWith love and pity--vain distress!\r\nO, what deep rigours must succeed\r\nThis first sole touch of tenderness!\r\nHer eyes grow glazed and motionless,\r\nNailed on his wavering corse; each bone\r\nHardening in growth, invades her flesh,\r\nWhich late so rosy, warm, and fresh,\r\nNow stagnates into stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nFrom limb to limb the frosts aspire,\r\nHer vitals curdle with the cold;\r\nThe blood forgets its crimson fire,\r\nThe veins that e'er its motion rolled;\r\nTill now the virgin's glorious mould\r\nWas wholly into marble changed;\r\nOn which the Salaminians gazed,\r\nLess at the prodigy amazed,\r\nThan of the crime avenged.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nThen tempt not thou Fate's angry arms,\r\nBy cruel frown, or icy taunt;\r\nBut let thy perfect deeds and charms\r\nTo poets' harps, Divinest, grant\r\nThemes worthy their immortal vaunt;\r\nElse must our weeping strings presume\r\nTo celebrate in strains of woe,\r\nThe justice of some signal blow,\r\nThat strikes thee to the tomb.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no room to multiply passages, and with this ode must conclude\r\nour specimens. Garcilaso is a happy type of a Spanish poet; and when we\r\nthink that such men were the children of the old liberty of Spain, how\r\ndeeply we must regret the worse than iron rule that blasted the race;\r\nwhile we view in any attempt to regain her ancient freedom, a promise of\r\na new people, to adorn the annals of mankind with all the virtues of\r\nheroism and all the elevation of genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: This anecdote is usually told as appertaining to the\r\nfather of the poet; but the name was assumed by the family at an earlier\r\ndate.

Mendoza was gifted neither with Boscan's mild benevolence nor\r\nGarcilaso's tenderness. That he was the friend of these men, and\r\naddicted to literature, is his chief praise. Endowed with talents, of a\r\nhigh and haughty disposition, his firmness degenerated into severity,\r\nand his valour into vehemence of temper. He was shrewd, worldly and\r\narrogant, but impassioned and resolute. He possessed many of those high\r\nqualities, redeeming, while they were stained by pride, which in that\r\nage distinguished the Spanish cavalier; for in those days, the freedom\r\nenjoyed by the Castilian nobility was but lately crushed, and its\r\ngenerous influence still survived in their manners and domestic habits.\r\nIt was characteristic of that class of men, that, when Charles V. asked\r\na distinguished one among them to receive the Constable Bourbon in his\r\nhouse, the noble acquiesced in the commands of his sovereign, but\r\nannounced at the same time, his intention of razing his house to the\r\nground, as soon as the traitor had quitted it.\r\n\r\nDon Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (and to give him all the titles enumerated\r\nby his Spanish biographer), Knight Commander of the Houses of Calatrava\r\nand Badajoz, in the order of Alcantara, of the council of Charles V.,\r\nand his ambassador to Venice, Rome, England, and the council of Trent,\r\ncaptain-general of Siena, and gonfalonier of the holy Roman church, was\r\nborn in the city of Granada, about the year 1500. He was of noble\r\nextraction on both sides,--his father being second count of Tendilla,\r\nand first marquis of Mondejar; his mother, donna Francisca Pacheco,\r\ndaughter of don Juan Pacheco, marquis of Villena. Being the fifth son,\r\nDiego was destined for the church, and from his most tender years\r\nreceived a literary education. He was sent to the university of\r\nSalamanca, where he studied theology, and became a proficient in the\r\nLatin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic languages, to which he applied himself\r\nwith diligence. Yet, though a laborious student, gayer literature\r\nengaged his attention; and while still at Salamanca, he wrote Lazarillo\r\nde Tormes, a tale at once declaratory of the originality of his genius.\r\nThe graphic descriptions, the penetration into character, the worldly\r\nknowledge, the vivacity and humour, bespeak an author of more advanced\r\nyears. Who that has read it, can forget the proud and poor hidalgo, who\r\nshared with Lazarillo his dry crusts; or the seven ladies who had one\r\nesquire between them; or the silent and sombre master whose actions were\r\nall mysteries, and whose locked-up wealth, used with so much secrecy and\r\ndiscretion, yet brings on him the notice of the inquisition? It is\r\nstrange that, in after life, Mendoza did not, full of experience and\r\nobservation, revert to this species of writing. As it is, it stands a\r\ncurious specimen of the manners of his times, and as the origin of Gil\r\nBlas; almost we had said of Don Quixote, and is the more admirable, as\r\nbeing the production of a mere youth.\r\n\r\nMendoza probably found the clerical profession ill-suited to his tastes;\r\nhe became a soldier and a statesman; and particularly in the latter\r\ncapacity his talents were appreciated by the emperor Charles V. He was\r\nappointed ambassador[21] to Venice; and, in the year 1545, was deputed\r\nby his sovereign to attend the council of Trent, where he made a learned\r\nand elegant oration, which was universally admired, and confirmed the\r\nopinion already entertained of his talents, so that he was first\r\npromoted ambassador to Rome, and in 1547, he was named governor and\r\ncaptain-general of Siena. This was a difficult post; and Mendoza\r\nunfortunately acquitted himself neither with credit nor success.\r\n\r\nBefore the imperial and French arms had found in Italy a lists in which\r\nto contend, this country had been torn by the Ghibeline and Guelphic\r\nfactions; and these names remained as watchwards after the spirit of\r\nthem had passed away. When the French and Spaniards struggled for\r\npre-eminence, the Spaniards, as imperialists, naturally espoused the\r\ninterests of the Ghibeline cause, to which Siena was invariably a\r\npartisan. The Spaniards prevailed. At the treaty of Cambria, the emperor\r\nbecame possessed of acknowledged sway over a large portion of that fair\r\nland: over the remainder he exercised an influence scarcely less\r\ndespotic. Florence, adhering with tenacious fondness to her ancient\r\nrepublican institutions, was besieged: it capitulated, and, after some\r\nfaint show of temporising on the part of Charles, the chief of the\r\nMedici family was made sovereign with the title grand duke.\r\n\r\nSiena, Ghibeline from ancient association, and always adhering to the\r\nimperial party, was not the less enslaved. Without openly interfering in\r\nits institutions, the emperor used his influence for the election of the\r\nduke of Amalfi as chief of the republic. The duke, a man of small\r\ncapacity, was entirely led by Giulio Salvi and his six brothers. This\r\nfamily, thus exalted, displayed intolerable arrogance: it placed itself\r\nabove the law; and the fortunes, the wives and children, of their\r\nfellow-citizens, became the victims.\r\n\r\nThe Sienese made their complaints to the emperor, on his return from his\r\nexpedition against Algiers; while, at the same time, Cosmo I., whose\r\nfavourite object was to possess himself of Siena, declared that the\r\nSalvi were conspiring to deliver that town into the hands of the French,\r\nand so once more to give that power a footing in Italy. The emperor,\r\nroused by an intimation of this design, deputed an officer to reform the\r\ngovernment of Siena. A new oligarchy was erected, and the republic was\r\nbrought into absolute dependence on the commands of the emperor.\r\n\r\nSiena was quieted, but not satisfied, while a new treaty between Charles\r\nV. and France took from them their hope of recurring to the assistance\r\nof the latter. After the peace, don Juan de Luna commanded at Siena,\r\nwith a small Spanish garrison. But still the seeds of discontent and of\r\nrevolt, fostered by an ardent attachment to their ancient institutions,\r\nlay germinating in the hearts of the citizens. Charles never sent pay to\r\nhis soldiers: during time of war they lived by booty, in time of peace,\r\nby extortion; love of liberty, and hatred of their oppressors, joined to\r\ncause them to endeavour to throw off the foreign yoke. On the 6th of\r\nFebruary 1545, the people rose in tumult; about thirty nobles were\r\nkilled, the rest took refuge in the palace with don Juan de Luna. The\r\ntroops of Cosmo I. hovered on the frontier. He, perhaps, fostered the\r\nrevolt for his own ends; at least, he was eager to take advantage of it,\r\nand wished the Spanish governor to call in his aid to quell it. But don\r\nJuan wanted either resolution or foresight; he allowed the Spanish\r\ngarrison to be dismissed, and, finally, a month afterwards, was forced\r\nto quit the town, accompanied by the obnoxious members of the\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nFor sometime Siena enjoyed the popular liberty which they had attained,\r\ntill circumstances led the emperor to fear that the French would gain\r\npower there; and he resolved to reduce the city to unqualified\r\nsubmission. Mendoza was then ambassador at Rome. Charles named him\r\ncaptain-general of Siena, and gave him orders to introduce a Spanish\r\ngarrison, and even to build a citadel for its protection. Mendoza\r\nobeyed: as the subject of a despotic sovereign, he felt no remorse in\r\ncrushing the liberties of a republic. He did not endeavour to\r\nconciliate, nor to enforce respect by the justice of his measures. He\r\nheld the discontented and outraged citizens in check by force of arms\r\nonly; disarming them, and delivering them up to the insolence and\r\nextortion of the Spanish soldiery. They could obtain no protection\r\nagainst all the thousand injuries, thefts, and murders to which they\r\nwere subjected. Mendoza, haughty and unfeeling, became the object of\r\nuniversal hatred. Complaints against him were carried to the emperor,\r\nand, when these remained without effect, his life was attempted by\r\nassassination: on one occasion his horse was killed under him by a\r\nmusket shot, aimed at himself. But Mendoza was as personally fearless as\r\nhe was proud; and the sternness that humanity could not mitigate, was\r\nnot softened by the suggestions of caution.\r\n\r\nAffairs of import called him away from his government. On the death of\r\nPaul III. his presence was required at Rome to influence the election of\r\na new pope. He left Siena, together with the unfinished citadel and its\r\ngarrison, under the command of don Juan Franzesi, and repaired to watch\r\nthe progress of the conclave. Through his intrigues the cardinal del\r\nMonte was elected, who took the name of Julian III. The new pope,\r\nelected through Spanish influence, adhered to the emperor's interests.\r\nHe instantly yielded the great point of contention between Paul III. and\r\nCharles V., and consented to the restitution of the general council to\r\nTrent. Mendoza twice attended this council for the purpose of bringing\r\nthe cardinals and prelates to a better understanding. On his return the\r\npope named him gonfaloniere of the church; and in this character he\r\nsubdued Orazio Farnese, who had rebelled. Besides these necessary causes\r\nof absence from his government, he was accused of protracting his stay\r\nin Rome on account of an amorous intrigue in which he was engaged, and\r\nwhich occasioned a great deal of scandal.\r\n\r\nThe Sienese were on the alert to take advantage of his absence. The\r\nrapacity and ill faith displayed by Mendoza effectually weaned them from\r\nall attachment to the imperial cause; and when fresh war broke out\r\nbetween Charles and the French king, the Sienese solicited the aid of\r\nthe latter to deliver them from a tyranny they were unable any longer to\r\nendure. The grand duke of Florence had reason to complain of the\r\nSpaniards, and especially of Mendoza, who treated him as the vassal of\r\nthe emperor; yet he was unwilling that the French should gain footing in\r\nTuscany, and besides hoped to advance his own interests, and to add\r\nSiena to his dukedom. He discovered a correspondence between that town\r\nand the French, and revealed it to Mendoza, offering the aid of an armed\r\nforce in the emperor's favour. Mendoza, distrusting the motive of his\r\noffers, rejected them. He applied to the pope for assistance; but\r\nJulian, offended by his conduct on various occasions, evaded the request\r\nand remained neutral. Meanwhile, Mendoza, either ignorant of the\r\nimminence of the danger, or despising the power of the enemy, took no\r\nactive measures to prevent the mischief which menaced his government.\r\n\r\nThe Sienese exiles assembled together, and put themselves under the\r\ncommand of a leader in the French pay. They marched towards Siena, and\r\narriving before the gates on the evening of the 26th of July 1552,\r\nproclaimed _Liberty!_ The people, though unarmed, rose at the cry. They\r\nadmitted the exiles, and drove the garrison, which merely consisted of\r\n400 soldiers, from the convent of San Domenico, in which they had\r\nfortified themselves, and pursued them to the citadel, which was badly\r\nfortified and badly victualled. After a few days Franzesi capitulated,\r\nand Siena was lost to the emperor. Mendoza was accused of various faults\r\non this occasion; of weakening the garrison, and of not putting, through\r\navarice, the citadel in a state of defence; and, above all, of delay,\r\nwhen he had been warned by Cosmo, and not being on the spot himself to\r\nsecure the power of his master in the town. These faults, joined to the\r\nhatred in which he was held, caused the emperor not long after (1554) to\r\nrecall him to Spain.\r\n\r\nWhile thus employed in Italy as a statesman and a soldier, his active\r\nmind led him also to other pursuits. Many inedited philosophical works\r\nof his are to be found in Spanish libraries. He wrote a paraphrase of\r\nAristotle, and a translation into Spanish of the Mechanics of that\r\nphilosopher; he composed Political Commentaries, and a history of the\r\ntaking of Tunis. In the library of manuscripts at Florence, Sedano tells\r\nus there exists a volume in quarto entitled, \"Various Works of D. Diego\r\nde Mendoza, ambassador of his majesty to Venice, Turkey, and England.\"\r\nOn all occasions he showed himself an enthusiastic lover of learning,\r\nand a liberal patron of learned men; as a proof of which the bookseller\r\nPaulus Manutius dedicated his edition of Cicero to him. Since the days\r\nof Petrarch, no man had been so eager to collect Greek manuscripts. He\r\nsent to Greece and Mount Athos to procure them, and even made their\r\nacquisition a clause in a political treaty with the Sultan. He thus\r\ncollected a valuable library, which at his death he bequeathed to Philip\r\nII., and it forms a precious portion of the library of the Escurial.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, as a poet that his name is most distinguished in\r\nliterature. He was a friend of Boscan, and entered into his views for\r\nenlarging the sphere of Spanish poetry by the introduction of the\r\nItalian style. Though a hitter enemy to the spirit of liberty in Italy,\r\nhe could yet appreciate and profit by the highly advanced state of\r\npoetry and literature in that country, of which this very spirit was the\r\nparent.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in the record of his employments, that he went\r\nambassador to England and Turkey; but it is uncertain at what time these\r\njournies were performed; probably before his return to Spain in 1554.\r\n\r\nConsiderable obscurity is thrown over the latter years of his life. That\r\nis, no sufficient pains has been taken to throw light upon them. His\r\nmanuscript works would, doubtless, if consulted, tell us more about him\r\nthan is at present known. He devoted a portion of the decline of his\r\nlife to study and literature; but it would seem that on his return from\r\nItaly, he did not immediately retire from active life, as it is\r\nmentioned by some of his biographers that he continued member of the\r\ncouncil of state under Philip II. and was present at the battle of St.\r\nQuentin, fought in 1557. One of the last adventures recorded of him is\r\ncharacteristic of the vehemence of his temper. While at court, he had a\r\nquarrel with a noble who was his rival in the affections of a lady. His\r\nantagonist, in a fit of exasperation, unsheathed a dagger; but before he\r\ncould use it, Mendoza seized him and threw him from the balcony where\r\nthey were standing, into the street below. In all countries in those\r\ndays, a personal assault within the precincts of a royal court was\r\nlooked upon as a very serious offence, and Spanish etiquette caused it\r\nto be regarded in a still more heinous light. Still Mendoza was not the\r\naggressor: and his punishment was limited to a short imprisonment, where\r\nhe amused himself by addressing the lady of his love in various\r\nredondillas.\r\n\r\nMuch of the latter part of his life was spent in retirement in his\r\nnative city of Granada, given up to study and literature. He here\r\ncomposed the most esteemed of his prose works--the \"History of the War\r\nof the Moriscos in Granada.\" The style of this work is exceedingly pure.\r\nHe took the Latin authors Sallust and Cæsar for his models; and being\r\nan eye-witness of the events he records, his narrative is highly\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nWhile in Italy, he had written a state paper, addressed to the emperor,\r\ndissuading him from selling the duchy of Milan to the pope, which was\r\nconceived in so free a style, that Sandoval, in quoting it in his\r\nhistory, believed it necessary to soften its expressions. In the same\r\nway this acute observer perceived the faults of the Spanish government\r\nagainst the Moriscos, and alluded to, although he did not dare blame\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPhilip II., a bigoted tyrant, drove this portion of his subjects to\r\ndespair. Mendoza tells us that just before their revolt, \"the\r\ninquisition began to persecute them more than ever. The king ordered\r\nthem to quit the Morisco language, and all commerce and communication\r\none with the other: he took from them their negro slaves, whom they had\r\nbrought up with the same kindness as if they had been their children: he\r\nforced them to cast off their Arab dress, in which they held invested a\r\nlarge capital, and obliged them, at a great expense, to adopt the\r\nCastilian costume. He forced the women to appear with uncovered faces,\r\nopening all that portion of their houses which they were accustomed to\r\nkeep closed; and both of these orders appeared intolerable to this\r\njealous people. It was spread abroad also that he intended to possess\r\nhimself of their children, and to educate them in Castile: he forbade\r\nthe use of baths, which contributed at once to their cleanliness and\r\npleasure. Their music, songs, feasts, and weddings, held according to\r\ntheir manners and customs, and all assemblies of a joyful nature, were\r\nalready interdicted; and these new regulations were published without\r\naugmenting the guards, without sending troops, without reinforcing the\r\ngarrisons or establishing new ones.\"[22]\r\n\r\nThe effect of such a system on a proud and valorous people, passionately\r\nattached to their religion and customs, might be anticipated. The Moors\r\ncollected arms secretly, and laid up stores in the rugged mountains of\r\nthe Alpujarra: they chose for king the young Fernando de Valor,\r\ndescended from their ancient sovereigns, who assumed the name of Aben\r\nHumeya. The progress of the revolt, however, met with various checks,\r\nand they did not receive the aid they expected from the sultan Selim.\r\nInstead, therefore, of taking Granada, their war became guerilla; and\r\nthe spirit of vengeance incited them to the exercise of frightful\r\ncruelties, by way of reprisal, on the Christian prisoners who fell into\r\ntheir hands. An army was sent against them, commanded by don John of\r\nAustria, natural son of Charles V..; Mendoza's nephew, the marquis of\r\nMondejar, was one of the principal generals under him: Mendoza,\r\ntherefore, had full opportunity to learn the details of the war, which\r\nterminated in the success of the Spaniards, whose cruelties rivalled\r\nthose of the unfortunate rebels. The Moriscos were put down by the\r\nmassacre of several villages, and the selling of the inhabitants of a\r\nwhole territory into slavery. This total destruction of the Morisco\r\npeople is described by Mendoza, with a truth that prevented his history\r\nfrom being published until 1610, and even then with great omissions: a\r\ncomplete edition did not appear till 1776.\r\n\r\nAfter a retreat of some years, Mendoza appeared at court again in his\r\nold age, at Valladolid: his reputation caused him to be admired as an\r\noracle; his erudition and genius commanded universal respect. He enjoyed\r\nthese honours but a few months, and died in the year 1575.\r\n\r\nThere are few men of whom the Spaniards are more proud than Mendoza,\r\nwhom, to distinguish from other poets of the same name, they usually\r\ncall the Ambassador. \"Most certain it is,\" says Sedano, \"that from the\r\nimportance and diversity of his employments, he was considered one of\r\nthe most famous among the many great men which that age produced. His\r\nardent mind was perpetually employed in the support of the glory of his\r\nsovereign and the honour of his country; and in all the transactions in\r\nwhich he was employed, his zeal, his integrity, his deep policy, his\r\npenetration, and his understanding shone out; and the very faults of\r\nwhich he is accused, must be attributed to the envy and hatred of his\r\nenemies.\"\r\n\r\nWe may not, perhaps, be ready to echo much of this praise. The oppressor\r\nof a free people must always hold an obnoxious position; and when to the\r\nsevere and unpitying system he adopted towards others, we find that he\r\nindulged his own passions even to the detriment of his sovereign's\r\ninterests, we feel somewhat of contempt mingled with resentment. We are\r\ntold that in person he was tall and robust, dignified in his deportment,\r\nbut ugly in the face. His complexion was singularly dark, and the\r\nexpression of his countenance haughty; his eyes were vivacious and\r\nsparkling; and we may believe that his irregular and harsh features were\r\nredeemed in some degree by the intellect that informed them.\r\n\r\nIn judging of him as a poet, he falls far short of Garcilaso; but in\r\nsome respects he may be considered as superior to Boscan. His short and\r\nsimple poems, named in Spanish vilancicos, are full of life and spirit,\r\nand are fitted to become popular from the simplicity and yet vivacity of\r\ntheir sentiments and versification: they are the sparkling emanations of\r\nthe passions, expressed at the moment, with all the ardour of living\r\nemotion. Indeed, he so far indulged in this sort of composition,\r\ntempting to one who feels that he can thus impart, and so perhaps obtain\r\nsympathy for, the emotions that boil within him, that most of his\r\nsmaller poems remain inedited as being too free; the Spanish press never\r\nbeing permitted to put forth works of a licentious nature. His epistles\r\nimitated from Horace, want elegance and harmony; but they are forcible,\r\nand full of excellent sense and good feeling. He could not rise to the\r\nsublime. There is a complimentary ode of his addressed to cardinal\r\nEspinosa, on his assuming the hat, for the writing of which, we are told\r\nby his secretary, that he prepared by three days' study of Pindar; but\r\nit breathes no Pindaric fire; there is bathos rather than height in the\r\nsimiles he makes, drawn from the purple of the cardinal's new dress, and\r\nthe crimson colours with which the sun invests the empyreum. Mendoza was\r\nnot an imaginative poet; and it is observable, that when a person, not\r\nsuch by nature, deals in the ideal, the result is rather the ridiculous\r\nthan the sublime. Acute, earnest, playful, passionate, but neither\r\ntender nor sublime, if we except a few of his minor love poems, we read\r\nMendoza's verses rather to become acquainted with the man than seek the\r\nsoul of poetry in his compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The penetration with which Mendoza saw through the lofty\r\npretensions of diplomacy, and the keenness of his observation, which\r\nstripped this science of all its finery, is forcibly expressed in one of\r\nhis epistles, He exclaims--\r\n\r\n\"O embaxadores, puros majaderos,\r\nque si los reges quieren engañar,\r\ncomiençan por nosotros los primeros.\r\nNuestro major negocio es, no dañar,\r\ny jamas hacer cosa, ni dezilla,\r\nque no corramos riesgo de enseñar.\"\r\n\r\nO ye ambassadors! ye simpletons! When kings wish to deceive they begin\r\nfirst with us.--Our chief business is to do no harm, and never to do or\r\nsay anything, that we may not run the risk of making others as wise as\r\nourselves.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Mendoza felt himself obliged in his own person to refrain\r\nfrom all censure on the edicts of his sovereign. But in a speech he\r\nintroduced after the manner of Sallust, as spoken by one of the chiefs,\r\nhe conveyed, in forcible terms, his sense of the persecution which the\r\nunhappy Moors endured. The conspirator exclaims: \"What hinders a man,\r\nspeaking Castilian, from following the law of the prophet, or one who\r\nspeaks Morisco from following that of Jesus? They take our children to\r\ntheir congregations and schools, teaching them arts which our ancestors\r\nforbade, that purity of the law might not be disturbed nor its truth\r\ndisputed. We are threatened at every hour that they shall be taken from\r\nthe arms of their mothers and the bringing up of their fathers, and\r\ncarried into distant lands, where they will forget our customs, and\r\nlearn to become the enemies of the fathers who begot them, and the\r\nmothers who bore them. We are ordered to cast off our national dress,\r\nand to adopt the Castilian. Germans dress after one manner, the French\r\nafter another, the Greeks after another. The clergy have a peculiar\r\ngarb--youths one sort of dress--old men another--each nation, and each\r\nprofession, and each rank, adopts its own style of dress. Yet all are\r\nChristians. And we Moors--why do we dress in the Morisco, as if our\r\nfaith hung in our garb--not in our hearts?\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUIS DE LEON\r\n\r\n1527-1591.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a variety in the physiognomy and character of the poets whose\r\nbiography is here traced, that renders each in himself highly\r\ninteresting; our misfortune is that we know so little of them. Sedano\r\nbitterly laments the obscurity which wraps the history of the great\r\nliterary men of Spain, through the neglect of their contemporaries to\r\ntransmit the circumstances of their lives. We have but slight sketches;\r\nyet their works, joined to these, individualise the man, and give\r\nanimation and interest to very slender details. We image Boscan in his\r\nrural retirement, philosophising, book in hand;--revolving in his\r\nthoughts the harmonies of verse, conversing with his friends, enjoying\r\nwith placid smile the calm content, or rather, may we not say, the\r\nperfect home-felt, heart-reaching happiness of his married life, which\r\nhe felt so truly, and describes in such lively colours. Young still, his\r\naffections ardent, but concentrated, he acknowledges that serenity,\r\nconfidence, and sweet future hopes; unreserved sympathy, and entire\r\ncommunity of the interests of life, is the real Paradise on earth.\r\nGarcilaso, the gallant soldier, the tender poet, the admired and loved\r\nof all, is of another character, more heroic, more soft, more romantic.\r\nMendoza, with his fiery eye, his vehement temper, his untamed\r\npassions--and these mingled with respect for learning, friendship for\r\nthe worthy, and talents that exalted his nature to something noble and\r\nimmortal, despite his defects, contrasts with his friends: and the\r\nfourth now coming, Luis de Leon--more earnest and enthusiastic than\r\nBoscan--tender as Garcilaso, but with a soul whose tenderness was\r\nengrossed by heavenly not earthly love--pure and high-hearted, with the\r\nnobility of genius stamped on his brow, but with religious resignation\r\ncalming his heart,--he is different, but more complete--a man Spain only\r\ncould produce; for in Spain only had religion such sovereign sway as\r\nwholly to reduce the rebel inclinations of man, and, by substituting\r\nsupernal for terrestrial love, not diminish the fulness and tenderness\r\nof passion, but only give it another object. High poetic powers being\r\njoined not only to the loftiest religious enthusiasm, to learning, but\r\nalso the works of this amiable and highly-gifted man are different from\r\nall others, but exquisite in their class. We wish to learn more of his\r\nmind: as it is, we know little, except that as his compositions were\r\ncharacteristic of his virtues, so were the events of his life of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe family of Luis Ponce de Leon was the noblest in Andalusia. He was\r\nborn at Granada in the year 1527. It would appear that his childhood was\r\nnot happy, for in an ode to the Virgin, written when in the dungeons of\r\nthe inquisition, he touchingly speaks of his abandonment in infancy,\r\nsaying:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mother died as soon as I was born,[23]\r\nAnd I was dedicate to thee, a child,\r\nBequeathed by my poor mother's dying prayer.\r\nA second parent thou, O Virgin mild.\r\nFather and mother to the babe forlorn;\r\nFor my own father made me not his care.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was this neglect, probably, that led him to place his affections on\r\nreligious objects: and the enthusiasm he felt, he believed to be a\r\nvocation for a monastic life. At the age of sixteen, he endued the habit\r\nof the order of St. Augustin in the convent of Salamanca, and took the\r\nvows during the following year. Enthusiastically pious, but without\r\nfanaticism, his heart was warmed only by the softer emotions of\r\nreligion; love, and resignation, a taste for retirement, and pleasure in\r\nfulfilling the duties of his order. His soul was purified, but not\r\nnarrowed by his piety. He loved learning, and was an elegant classical\r\nscholar. Most of his poems were written when young. He translated a\r\ngreat deal from Virgil and Horace, and became imbued by their elegance\r\nand correctness. He was celebrated also as a theologian, and he pursued\r\nhis scholastic studies with an ardour that led him to adorn his\r\nreligious faith with the imaginative hues of poetry and the earnest\r\nsentiments of his heart. He was admired for his learning by his\r\ncontemporaries, and rose high in the estimation of the scholars of\r\nSalamanca, where he resided. At the age of thirty-three, he was made\r\ndoctor of theology by the university of that town. In the year 1561, he\r\nwas elected to the chair of St. Thomas, over the heads of seven\r\ncandidates, by a large majority.\r\n\r\nAlthough his learning, his piety, and the austerity of his life, caused\r\nhim to be regarded with universal respect, yet he had enemies, the\r\nresult, probably, of his very excellencies. These took advantage of a\r\nslight imprudence he had committed, to plunge him into the most\r\nfrightful misfortune. He greatly loved and admired Hebrew poetry; and,\r\nto please a friend, who did not understand the learned languages, he\r\ntranslated into Spanish, and commented upon, the Song of Solomon. His\r\nfriend was heedless enough to permit copies to be taken, and it thus\r\nbecame spread abroad. Who was the machinator of the disaster that ensued\r\nwe are not told; but he was accused before the tribunal of the\r\ninquisition of heresy, for disobeying the commands of the church, in\r\ntranslating Scripture into the vulgar tongue. He was seized, and thrown\r\ninto the prison of the inquisition, at Valladolid, in the year 1572.\r\nHere he remained five years, suffering all the hardships of a rigorous\r\nand cruel confinement. Confined in a dungeon, without light or\r\nspace--cut off from communication with his friends--allowed no measures\r\nof defence--hope seemed shut out from him, while all means of\r\noccupation were denied him.\r\n\r\nHis pious mind found consolation in religion. He could turn to the\r\nobjects of his worship, implore their aid, and trust to the efficacy of\r\ntheir intercession before God. Sometimes, however, his heart failed him,\r\nand it was complaints rather than prayers that he preferred. His odes to\r\nthe Virgin were written during this disastrous period; and among them\r\nthat from which we have already quoted, in which he pathetically\r\ndescribes and laments the extremity of adversity to which he was\r\nreduced. The whole ode in Spanish is full of pathos, and gentle, yet\r\ndeep-felt lamentation, a few stanzas may give some idea of the\r\nacuteness of his sufferings. Thus he speaks of the hopeless, lingering\r\nevils of his imprisonment:--\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I look back, I feel a wild despair--[24]\r\nI shrink with terror from the coming days,\r\nFor they will mirror but the hideous past;\r\nWhile heavy and intolerable weighs\r\nThe evil load of all that now I bear;\r\nNor have I hope but it will ever last--\r\nThe arrows come so fast;\r\nI feel a deadly wound,\r\nAnd, shudd'ring, look around;\r\nAnd as the blood, rushing all warm, doth flow,\r\nBehold! another, and another blow!\r\nWhile they who deal to me such fierce annoy.\r\nRejoice to see my woe--\r\nLamenting still they do not quite destroy!\r\n\r\nTo what poor wretch did heaven e'er deny\r\nLeave to declare the misery he feels?\r\nLaments can ease the weight of heaviest chain;\r\nBut cruel fate with me so harshly deals,\r\nStifling within my lips the gushing cry,\r\nSo that aloud I never may complain:\r\nFor, could I tell my pain,\r\nWhat heart were hard enough,\r\nThough made of sternest stuff,\r\nTiger or basilisk, or serpent dread,\r\nThat would not gentle tears of pity shed,\r\nSymbols of tender sorrow for my woes?\r\nThe while by hatred fed,\r\nFate's hostile fury ever fiercer grows.\r\n\r\nFrom living man no comfort reaches me:\r\nFrom me the dearest and most faithful friend\r\nWould fly beyond the earth's remotest end,\r\nSo not to share my hopeless misery!\r\nAnd my sad eyes, where'er I turn my sight,\r\nAre strangers to the light.\r\nNo man that comes anear,\r\nMy name did ever hear--\r\nSo I myself almost myself forget!\r\nNor know if what I was, so am I yet--\r\nNor why to me this misery befell:\r\nNor can I knowledge get;\r\nFor none to me the horrid tale will tell.\r\n *  *  *\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nWreck'd is my vessel on a shoreless sea,\r\nWhere there is none to help me in my fear,\r\nWhere none can stretch a friendly saving hand!\r\nI call on men--but there are none to hear;\r\nIn the wide world there's no man thinks of me;\r\nMy failing voice can never reach the land!\r\nBut, while I fearful stand,\r\nA blessed, heaven-sent thought,\r\nBy bitter suffering brought,\r\nBids me, O Virgin! trust to thee alone.\r\nThou never turn'st away from those who cry,\r\nNor wilt thou let thy son,\r\nO piteous Mother! miserably die.\r\n\r\nMy mother died as soon as I was born;\r\nAnd I was dedicate to thee, a little child,\r\nBequeath'd by my poor mother's dying prayer;\r\nA second parent thou, O Virgin mild!--\r\nFather and mother to the babe forlorn!\r\nFor my own father made me not his care:--\r\nAnd, Lady, canst thou bear\r\nA child of thine thus lost,\r\nAnd in such danger tost?\r\nTo other sorrows art thou not so blind:\r\nThey waken pity in thy gentle mind,\r\nThou givest aid to every other,\r\nTo me be also kind;\r\nListen, and save thy son, O piteous Mother!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt could not be, however, but that a heart so truly pious would find\r\nrelief in prayer, and feel at intervals strong animating confidence in\r\nheaven. Thus, in contrast with these laments, we have a description of\r\nanother mood of mind, which he gives in an epistle to a friend on his\r\nliberation. \"Cut off,\" he writes, \"not only from the conversation and\r\nsociety of men, but even from seeing them, I remained for five years\r\nshut up in darkness and a dungeon. I then enjoyed a peace and joy of\r\nmind that I often miss, now that I am restored to light, and the society\r\nof my friends.\"\r\n\r\nHe was at length liberated. Sedano tells us, that \"at last his trial\r\nbeing over, in virtue of the proofs and exculpations which he was\r\nenabled to bring in support of his innocence, he was set at liberty at\r\nthe end of the year 1576, and restored to all his honours and\r\nemployments.\" It is some consolation to find that his imprisonment\r\ncaused great scandal and outcry, and that his liberation was hailed with\r\nexultation and delight. The university had, from respect, never filled\r\nthe professor's chair, vacated during his imprisonment; and, on his\r\nreturn to Salamanca, the most distinguished persons of the town met him\r\non his way, and conducted him thither in triumph.\r\n\r\nFew events after this are recorded of his life. He visited Madrid; and\r\nthe royal council confided to him the task of the revision and\r\ncorrection of the works of St. Theresa de Jesu, which were much\r\nmutilated, and of preparing them for the press. About the same time,\r\nthere was attempted the reform of his order in Portugal, a work of\r\nimportance and difficulty to the catholic church. The assistance of Luis\r\nde Leon was required, and it is supposed that he even made a journey to\r\nPortugal for that purpose. In 1591, he was named vicar-general of his\r\nprovince, and soon afterward elected provincial; but he did not long\r\nenjoy this honour: nine days after his election he was attacked by some\r\nacute malady. The Spanish biographers take pains to assure us of the\r\nedifying piety of his end; and we can easily believe that a man who in\r\nyouth was entirely dedicate to religion, should in the calmness of old\r\nage and in the hour of death, reap from his belief the composure of\r\nspirit that makes a happy end. He died on the 23d of August 1591; in the\r\nsixty-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\nIn person, Luis Ponce de Leon is described as of fair height,\r\nwell-proportioned in person, vigorous and robust. His countenance was\r\nmanly, and the expression, despite the vivaciousness of his eyes,\r\nserious and calm. His mind was ever bent on religious objects: he seems\r\nto have forgotten his high birth and the splendour of his name, and to\r\nhave aspired only to Christian humility. Love of poetry and classical\r\nliterature were the only objects that ever called his attention from\r\npious contemplations; and these he followed chiefly in his youth. \"God\r\ngifted him,\" says Sedano, \"with a noble birth he adorned him with\r\nunderstanding and extraordinary talents; he made him the son of a house\r\nabounding in riches and prosperity, and bestowed on him religious and\r\nliterary honours; and it was necessary, for the sake of proving his\r\nvirtues and purifying his soul, to visit him with the misfortunes\r\nbelonging to the age in which he lived, proportionate to the greatness\r\nof his gifts.\" Sad as it is to reflect on an age and country in which\r\nvirtues so exemplary, and talents so exalted, met with unmerited\r\npersecution, we are almost glad to find that one of the pillars of the\r\nvery institutions that exercised such barbarous sway, was visited by its\r\ncruelty and injustice, to prove that no obedience and no excellence\r\ncould shelter even the submissive slaves of despotism from its tyranny.\r\nLuis de Leon had indeed a soul at once above submission and suffering.\r\nHe bowed before a higher than earthly power, and was exalted above\r\npersecution through his very humility--a proud humility, mixed with a\r\nconsciousness of strength and worth. On his liberation from prison, and\r\nrestoration to his professor's chair, all Salamanca flocked to hear his\r\nfirst lecture, drawn thither by reverence and curiosity. Luis de Leon\r\nappeared serene and cheerful, and commenced as if nothing had happened;\r\nnor alluded to the long interval, filled with such misery, that had\r\nintervened since his last lecture, beginning thus:--\"We said yesterday\r\nthat he had a willow for his symbol, and at its foot a hatchet, with\r\nthis inscription, 'Through injury and death.' Nobleness, virtue, and\r\ngenerosity spring up under the very attacks of adversity and\r\npersecution. A willow the more it is cut, so much the more vigorously\r\ndoes it throw out its shoots; and for this cause has it its name\r\n(_salix_) from the vigour with which it sprouts, and the swiftness of\r\nits growth.\"[25] And thus he adopted for his emblem, a pruned tree with\r\nthe knife at its foot, and the motto \"_Ab ipso ferro._\"\r\n\r\nAs a theologian, his works are held in high repute. It is to his praise\r\nthat, though austere and regular as a monk, he yet studied the liberal\r\narts with assiduity and success. He was well versed in Hebrew, Greek,\r\nand Latin, besides being entire master of his native Castilian. His\r\npoetry is held in great estimation: the purity and elegance of his style\r\nare unsurpassed. Those Spaniards, who are addicted to the tinsel of\r\nversification, accuse him of want of loftiness; but nothing can exceed\r\nthe harmony and flow of his verse, the grace and propriety of his ideas,\r\nand the truth and simplicity--the extreme ease and animation, of his\r\nstyle. It is unornamented--but for that very reason, more purely poetic.\r\nThe most perfect of his compositions is his \"Ode to Tranquil Life,\" in\r\nwhich he dwells with brooding, earnest delight on all the objects, and\r\nall the reveries that bless a man, content in solitude. His religious\r\npoetry comes less home to our hearts: it is so entirely catholic, but\r\nall is marked by enthusiasm and sincerity.\r\n\r\nAs a translator, he holds a high place; though he may be said rather to\r\nparaphrase than translate his models. He thus rendered into Spanish many\r\nof the odes of Horace, and various others selected from Pindar,\r\nTibullus, and Theocritus. He translated all the Eclogues of Virgil, and\r\nthe first book of his Georgies. He tells us, that he endeavoured to make\r\nthe ancient poets speak as they would have expressed themselves, had\r\nthey been born in his own age, in Castile, and had written in Castilian.\r\nIn an inferior poet this attempt had been indiscreet and rash, but Luis\r\nde Leon was so much master of style and harmony, that it is impossible\r\nto regret the new costume with which he invests our old favourites. He\r\nis chiefly blamed because the beauty of his paraphrases is so great: and\r\nthey have taken such hold of Spanish readers, that they preclude all\r\nfuture attempts at more literal translation. This is of slight import.\r\nIf the poems he gives us in Castilian are in themselves beautiful, the\r\nSpanish reader must be satisfied. A vigorous desire to have a perfect\r\nunderstanding of the originals ought to lead to the study of them in\r\ntheir native language--the only way really to attain it, and, to a\r\nCastilian, not a difficult one.\r\n\r\nWere there a good translation of the ode\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Que descansada vida,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwe should prefer quoting it, as most characteristic of the peculiar\r\nimagery and feeling of the poet. As it is, we are tempted to present Mr.\r\nWiffen's spirited translation of his ode on the Moorish invasion: the\r\nanimation and fire which it breathes has made it a favourite, and shows\r\nthat Luis de Leon was confined to didactic subjects rather from choice,\r\nthan by the necessity or narrowness of his genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As by Tagus' billowy bed,[26]\r\nKing Rodrigo, safe from sight,\r\nWith the lady Cava fed\r\nOn the fruit of loose delight;\r\nFrom the river's placid breast,\r\nSlow its ancient Genius broke;\r\nOf the scrolls of fate possess'd,\r\nThus the frowning prophet spoke:\r\n\r\n'In an evil hour dost thou,\r\nRuthless spoiler, wanton here!\r\nShouts and clangours even now,\r\nEven now assail mine ear--\r\nShout and sound of clashing shield,\r\nShiver'd sword, and rushing car--\r\nAll the frenzy of the field!--\r\nAll the anarchy of war!\r\n\r\n'O what wail and weeping spring\r\nForth from this, thine hour of mirth,\r\nFrom you fair and smiling thing,\r\nWho in an evil hour had birth!\r\nIn an evil day for Spain\r\nPlighted in your guilty troth--\r\nFatal triumph! costly gain\r\nTo the sceptre of the Goth!\r\n\r\n'Flames and furies, griefs and broils,\r\nSlaughter, ravage, fierce alarms,\r\nAnguish and immortal toils\r\nThou dost gather to thine arms,--\r\nFor thyself and vassals--those\r\nWho the fertile furrow break,\r\nWhere the stately Ebro flows.\r\nWho their thirst in Douro slake!\r\n\r\n'For the throne--the hall--the bower--\r\nMurcian lord and Lusian swain--\r\nFor the chivalry a flower\r\nOf all sad and spacious Spain!\r\nPrompt for vengeance, not for fame,\r\nEven now from Cadiz' halls,\r\nOn the Moor, in Allah's name,\r\nHoarse the Count--the Injur'd calls.\r\n\r\n'Hark, how frightfully forlorn\r\nSounds his trumpet to the stars,\r\nCiting Afric's desert-born\r\nTo the gonfalon of Mars!\r\nLo!

Yet to complete the history\r\nof Spanish literary men, it will be necessary to mention what has come\r\ndown to us.\r\n\r\nThe first on the list is Herrera. Fernando Herrera was a native of\r\nSeville. We learn nothing of his family, and even the date of his birth\r\nis unknown. It is conjectured that he was born at the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century. He was an ecclesiastic; but it is believed that he\r\nadopted this profession late in life, and we are ignorant of the\r\nposition he held in the hierarchy, and of all the events of his life. It\r\nis believed that he died at a very advanced age; but when and where we\r\nare not told. In the midst of all these negatives as to events, we get\r\nat a few affirmatives with regard to his qualities. There is an inedited\r\nwork, entitled \"The illustrious Men, Natives of Seville,\" written by\r\nRodrigo Caro, who thus mentions him:--\"Herrera was so well known in his\r\nnative town of Seville, and his memory is so regarded there, that I may\r\nbe considered in fault if my account of his works is brief: however, I\r\nwill repeat all I have heard without futile additions, for I knew,\r\nthough I never spoke to him,--I being a boy when he was an old man; but\r\nI remember the reputation he enjoyed. He understood Latin perfectly, and\r\nwrote several epigrams in that language, which might rival the most\r\nfamous ancient authors in thought and expression. He possessed only a\r\nmoderate knowledge of Greek. He read the best authors in the modern\r\nlanguages, having studied them with care; and to this he added a\r\nprofound knowledge of Castilian, carefully noting its powers of\r\nexpressing with nobleness and grandeur. He evidently wrote prose with\r\ngreat care, since his prose is the best in our language. As to his\r\nSpanish poetry, to which his genius chiefly impelled him, the best\r\ncritics pronounce his poems correct in their versification, full of\r\npoetic colouring, powerful and forcible as well as elegant and\r\nbeautiful; although, indeed, as he did not write for every vulgar\r\nreader, so that the uneducated are unable to judge of the extent of his\r\nerudition. He excelled in the art of selecting epithets and expressions,\r\nwithout affectation. He was naturally grave and severe, and his\r\ndisposition betrays itself in his verses. He associated with few,\r\nleading a retired life, either alone in his study, or in company, with\r\nsome friend, who sympathised with him, and to whom he confided his\r\ncares. Whether from this cause, or from the merit of his poetry, he was\r\ncalled the 'divine Herrera:' as a satirist of those days mentions:--\r\n\r\n\r\n'Thus a thousand rhymes and sonnets\r\nDivine Herrera wrote in vain.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"His poems were not printed during his life; Francisco Pacheco, a\r\ncelebrated painter of this city, whose studio was the resort of all\r\nclever men of Seville and the environs, performed this office. He was a\r\ngreat admirer of his works, and collected them with great care, and\r\nprinted them under the patronage of the count de Olivarez. Herrera's\r\nprose works are the best in our language. They consist of the Life and\r\nMartyrdom of Thomas More, president of the English parliament in the\r\ntime of the unhappy Henry VIII., leader and abettor of the schism of\r\nthat kingdom (translated from the Latin of Thomas Stapleton); the Naval\r\nBattle against the Turks at Lepanto; a Commentary on Garcilaso; all of\r\nwhich display deep reading in Greek, Latin, and modern languages, and\r\nwhich he published while living. He employed himself on a general\r\nHistory of Spain, to the time of the emperor Charles V., which he\r\nbrought up to the year 1590. He was well versed in philosophy: he\r\nstudied mathematics, ancient and modern geography, and possessed a\r\nchosen library. The reward of all this was only a benefice in the parish\r\nchurch of St. Andres in this city. But he has many associates in the\r\nmoderation of his fortune; for though every one praises merit, few seek\r\nand fewer reward it.\"[27]\r\n\r\nThe praise of Caro is echoed by others of more note. Cervantes, when he\r\nresided at Seville, frequented the society of Herrera; in his \"Voyage to\r\nParnassus\" he calls him the \"Divine,\" and says that the \"ivy of his fame\r\nclung to the walls of immortality.\" Lope de Vega in his \"Laurel de\r\nApollo,\" calls him the \"learned,\" and speaks of him with respect and\r\nadmiration. Sedano tells us that he was a handsome man; tall, of a manly\r\nand dignified aspect, lively eyes, and thick curled hair and beard. In\r\naddition, we learn that the lady of his love, whom he celebrates under\r\nthe names of Light, Love, Sun, Star--Eliodora, was the Countess of\r\nGelves. He loved her, it is said, all his life, to the very height of\r\nplatonic passion, which burnt fiery and bright in his own heart, but\r\nrevealed itself only by manifestations of reverence and self-struggle.\r\nThis sort of attachment, when true, is certainly of an heroic and\r\nsublime nature, and demands our admiration and sympathy; but we must be\r\nconvinced of the reality of the sufferings to which it gives rise, and\r\nof the unlimited nature of its devotion, or it becomes a mere picture\r\nwanting warmth and life. Petrarch's letters give a soul to his poetry:\r\nthe various accounts they contain of his solitary struggles at Vaucluse,\r\nmake us turn with deeper interest to his verses, which, otherwise, might\r\nalmost be reasoned away into a mere ideal feeling. Knowing nothing of\r\nHerrera but that he loved \"a bright particular star,\" shining far above,\r\nwe are willing to find an accord between this love of the elevated and\r\nunattainable, and the grandeur of the subjects he celebrates in his\r\npoetry, and the dignity of his verse.\r\n\r\nHerrera is a great favourite with those Spanish critics who prefer\r\nloftiness to simplicity of style, and the ideas of the head rather than\r\nthe emotions of the heart: the sublime style at which he aimed gained\r\nfor him the surname of Divine. Boscan, Garcilaso, and Luis de Leon,\r\nadopted the Italian metres, and with greater diffuseness, and therefore\r\nless classical elegance, but with equal truth and poetic verve, and\r\ninformed the Spanish language with powers unknown to former poets. But\r\nthis did not suffice for Herrera. He delighted in the grandiose and\r\nsonorous. He altered the language, introducing some obsolete and some\r\nnew words, and, attending with a sensitive ear to the modulations of\r\nsound, endeavoured to make harmony between the thought and its oral\r\nexpression. Lope de Vega held Herrera's versification in high esteem:\r\nquoting a passage from his odes, he exclaims, \"Here, no language exceeds\r\nour own--no, not even the Greek nor the Latin. Fernando de Herrera is\r\nnever out of my sight.\" Quintana, whose criticism is rather founded on\r\nartificial, rather than genuine and simple taste, as is apt to be the\r\ncase with critics, is also his great admirer. He considers that he\r\ncontributed more than any other to elevate, not only the poetic style of\r\nthe Spanish language, but the essence of its poetry, in gifting it with\r\nmore boldness of imagination and fire of expression than any preceding\r\npoet. Sedano is less partial: while he praises and admits his right to\r\nhis name of \"divine,\" he observes, that in endeavouring to purify and\r\nelevate his diction, he erred in rendering it harsh and barren, wanting\r\nin suavity and flow, and injured it by the affectation of antiquated\r\nphrases. His odes are certainly grand: we feel that the poet is full of\r\nhis subject, and rises with it. It is rash of a foreigner, indeed, to\r\ngive an opinion; still, we cannot help saying that while we admire the\r\nfervour of expression, the grandeur of the ideas, and the harmony of the\r\nversification, we miss the while a living grace more charming than all.\r\nIt is the poetry of the head rather than the heart. And thus, among\r\nHerrera's poems, the one we admire most is his Ode to Sleep; for, joined\r\nto elegant chasteness and great purity of language, we find a pure\r\ngenuine feeling, feelingly expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuave sueño, tu que en tarde buelo\r\nlas alas perezosas blandamente\r\nbates, de adormideras coronado,\r\npor el puro, adormido, vago cielo,\r\nven á la ultima parte de Ocidente,\r\ny de licor sagrado\r\nbaña mi ojos tristes que cansado\r\ny rendido al furor de mi tormento,\r\nno admito algun sosiego,\r\ny el dolor desconorta al infrimiento.\r\nVen a mi humilde ruego:\r\nven a mi ruego humilde, amor de aquella\r\nque Juno te ofreciò, tu Ninfa bella.\r\n\r\nDivino Sueño, gloria de mortales,\r\nregalo dulce al misero afligido:\r\nSueño amoroso, ven a quien espera\r\ncesar del egercicio de sus males,\r\ny al descanso bolver todo el sentido.\r\n¿ Como sufres que muera\r\nlejos de tu poder quien tuyo era?\r\n¿ No es vileza olvidar un solo pecho\r\nen veladora pena,\r\nque sin gozar del bien che al mundo has hecho,\r\nde tu vigor se agena?\r\nVen, Sueño alegre: Sueño, ven, dichoso:\r\nvuelve a mi alma ya, vuelve el reposo.\r\n\r\nSienta yo en tal estrecho tu grandeza:\r\nbaja, y esparce liquido el rocio:\r\nhuya la alba, que en torno resplandece,\r\nmira mi ardiente llanto y mi tristeza,\r\ny quanta fuerza tiene el pesar mio:\r\ny mi frente humidece,\r\nque ya de fuegos juntos el Sol crece.\r\nTorna, sabroso Sueño, y tus hermosas\r\nalas suenen aora,\r\ny huya con sus alas presurosas\r\nla desabrida Aurora;\r\ny lo che en mi falto la noche fria,\r\ntermine la cercana luz del dia.\r\n\r\nUna corona, o Sueño, de tus flores\r\nofrezco: tù produce el blando efecto\r\nen los desiertos cercos de mis ojos,\r\nque el ayre entrevgido con olores\r\nalhaga, y ledo mueve en dulce afecto:\r\ny de estos mis enojos\r\ndestierra, manso Sueño, los despojos.\r\nVen pues, amado Sueño, ven liviano,\r\nque del ruo Oriente\r\nDespunta el tierno Febo el rayo cano.\r\nVen ya, Sueño clemente,\r\ny acabara el dolor; asi te vea\r\nen brazos de tu cara Pasitea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Sedano.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAA DE MIRANDA\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this same period, so fertile in Spain with poetic genius, there\r\nflourished two Portuguese poets, whose names are introduced here from\r\ntheir connection with Spanish poetry. Saa de Miranda was horn in 1494,\r\nand died in 1558. His Spanish poems are bucolic, and more truly imbued\r\nwith rural imagery than that of those warrior poets, whose love of the\r\ncountry was that of gentlemen who enjoy the beauties of scenery and the\r\nblandishments of the odorous breezes, rather than of persons accustomed\r\nto the detail of pastoral life. Saa de Miranda sometimes mingled a\r\nhigher tone of description with his rural pictures; thus imitating\r\nnature, who associates the terrible with the lovely, the storm and the\r\nsoft breath of evening. At the same time, none excels Saa de Miranda in\r\nthe union of simplicity and grace: some of his verses remind the Italian\r\nreader of the odes of Chiabrera, such as these, describing the\r\nwanderings of a nymph, with which his fancy adorned a woodland scene:--\r\n\r\n\r\nGently straying,\r\nGently staying,\r\nShe breathed the fragrance of the breezy field;\r\nAnd, singing, fill'd her lap with flowers,\r\nThe which the meadows yield,\r\nPainting their verdure with a thousand colours.[28]\r\n\r\n\r\nNor does his poetry want the charm of melancholy sentiment, nor the\r\nvehemence of passion; while all that he writes has the peculiar merit of\r\na harmony and grace all his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: \"Graciosamente estando,\r\ngraciosamente andando,\r\nblando ayre respirava al prado ameno\r\nella cantava, y juntamente el seno\r\ninchiendose yva de diversas flores\r\nen que el prado era lleno\r\nsobre verde variado en mil colores.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORGE DE MONTEMAYOR\r\n\r\n\r\nJorge de Montemayor is another Portuguese poet, whose name belongs\r\nrather to Spain than Portugal. His real appellation is unknown. He\r\nadopted that of the place of his birth, Montemor, a town in the\r\njurisdiction of Coimbra in Portugal, which he in a manner translated\r\ninto Spanish, and called himself Jorge or George de Montemayor. He was\r\nborn about the year 1520, of humble origin, and slight education. In his\r\nyouth he entered the military profession. His talent for music first\r\nbrought him into notice: he emigrated into Castile, and endeavoured to\r\ngain his livelihood by music: he succeeded in being incorporated in the\r\nband of the Royal Chapel; and when the Infante don Philip, afterwards\r\nPhilip II., made his celebrated progress through Germany, Italy, and the\r\nLow Countries, having in his suite a band of choice musicians and\r\nsingers, Montemayor made one among them.\r\n\r\nThese travels tended to enlarge his mind; and, although unacquainted\r\nwith the learned languages, he became a proficient in various foreign\r\nones, and joined to these accomplishments a taste for literature. His\r\nlove for music was allied closely to a talent for poetry; and when on\r\nhis return to Spain, he resided at the city of Leon, he established his\r\nfame as an author, by writing his \"Diana.\" The fame of this book spread\r\nfar and wide: it was imitated by almost every poet that wrote in those\r\ndays, and the style in which it was composed became the fashion\r\nthroughout Spain.\r\n\r\nThe \"Diana\" is a pastoral of such an ideal species, that it sets\r\nchronology and history at defiance. Of these, our Shakspeare made light,\r\nwhen he wrote \"Cymbeline\" and the \"Winter's Tale;\" but the \"Diana\" is\r\neven more confused in its costume. The scene of it is placed at the foot\r\nof the mountains of Leon; and the heroine is said to be the object of a\r\nreal attachment of the author. This lady in other poems is called\r\nMarfisa: he is said to have loved her before he left Spain with the\r\ncourt: on his return he found her married; and his grief and her\r\ninfidelity he personified in the Sireno and Diana of his pastoral. Thus\r\nmany modern events are spoken of; and the adventures of Abindarres and\r\nXarifa, contemporaries of king Ferdinand, are mentioned as of old date,\r\nat the same time that Apollo and Diana, nymphs and fauns, are the\r\nobjects of adoration among the shepherds; for, indeed, in those days the\r\ngods of the Greeks made as it were an integral portion of poetry, and it\r\nwould have been considered a solecism to have omitted the names and\r\nworship of these deities. The story is conceived in the same\r\nheterogeneous manner. There is infinite simplicity in all the part that\r\nstrictly appertains to Diana and her lover; and much of what is romantic\r\nand even supernatural in the other portions.\r\n\r\nThe first book commences with the return of Sireno to the valleys of the\r\nmountains of Leon. He has already heard of the falsehood of his\r\nmistress, who is married to another. The romance opens with the songs of\r\nhis complaints. In one of these he addresses a lock of hair belonging to\r\nDiana; and nothing can be more simple, yet touching and true, and\r\nelegant, than the opening of this poem. He is joined by Silvano, another\r\nlover of Diana, who has always been disdained; and his resignation is\r\ntruly exemplary: these two hapless lovers are joined by a shepherdess,\r\nwho is also suffering the woes of unfortunate passion; and her history\r\nconcludes the book. In the second, events of more action are introduced:\r\nthe scene even changes to a sort of fairy tale; but though the machinery\r\nof the story alters, the sentiments remain the same, conceived in the\r\nlanguage of passion and reality. It is not until the sixth book that\r\nDiana herself is introduced, and the canzoni placed in her mouth are\r\namong the best in the book: she lays the blame of her infidelity on her\r\nparents, who forced her to marry a rich shepherd. The romance concludes\r\nwithout any change in the situation of the hero and heroine.\r\n\r\nIt is singular, that a work founded on such strange and unnatural\r\nmachinery should have seized on the imagination, we may almost say, of\r\nthe world; since this sort of pastoral became universally imitated; but\r\nthere is something in the rural pictures and out-of-door life which\r\ncomposes the scenery of such works., grateful, we know not why, to our\r\nhearts. The style of the \"Diana\" is, indeed, peculiarly beautiful.\r\nNothing can be more correct, yet less laboured; nothing more elegant,\r\nyet less exaggerated. To express vividly and truly, yet gracefully and\r\nin harmonious measure, the emotions of the various personages, appears\r\nto be the author's chief aim. Thus we read on, attracted by the melody\r\nof the style, the heartfelt truth of the sentiments, and the beauty of\r\nthe descriptions, even while we are quite careless of the developement\r\nof the plot, and tolerably uninterested in any of the personages. To\r\ntranslate the poetry of this book would be difficult, as the style forms\r\nits charm; but it is impossible to read it in the original without being\r\ncarried away by the flow of the versification, and the unaffected\r\nexpression of real feeling.\r\n\r\nThe \"Diana\" superseded for a time the books of chivalry, of which the\r\nSpaniards were so fond. Since Amadis first appeared, no work had been so\r\npopular. Cervantes, who imitated it in his \"Galatea,\" thus mentions it\r\nin the scrutiny the curate and barber make of Don Quixote's library.\r\nSpeaking of pastorals in general, the curate says: \"These books do not\r\ndeserve to be burned with the rest, because they have never done nor\r\nwill do the harm of which tales of chivalry are guilty; they are mere\r\nbooks of amusement, and hurt no one.\" Of the pastoral in question\r\nitself, he says: \"Let us begin by the \"Diana\" of Montemayor: I am of\r\nopinion that we tear out all that relates to the wise Felicia and the\r\nenchanted water, and almost all the poems in long measure, and let the\r\nprose remain, and the merit of its being the first of this species of\r\nbooks.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the reputation that Montemayor acquired by this romance, that\r\nthe queen of Portugal was desirous that he should return to his native\r\ncountry. He was, accordingly, recalled, and nothing more is known of him\r\nthan that it is supposed that he died a violent death[29],--where, even,\r\nis not known; for some say in Portugal, some in Italy: the dates\r\ntolerably agree, those named being 1561 and 1562, so that he was\r\nscarcely more than forty at the time of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Sedano tells us that the queen Catalina of Portugal, on\r\nrecalling him, conferred on him an honourable situation in the royal\r\nhousehold. The date of his death is ascertained through an elegy which\r\nis printed in all the editions of the \"Diana;\" and which mentions that\r\nhe died in 1562.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTILLEJO\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give a catalogue _raisonnée_ of all the poets that flourished in\r\nSpain in this age would be of little avail, as little is known of them\r\nand their poetry: though much of it is beautiful, and much more of it\r\nagreeable, it does not bear the stamp of the originality and genius\r\nnecessary to form an era in literature. Sedano gives brief notices of\r\nsome of them. From him we learn that Fernando de Acuna, a nobleman of\r\nPortuguese extraction, a distinguished courtier in the court, a gallant\r\nsoldier in the camp of Charles V., was also an intimate friend of\r\nGarcilaso de la Vega, and imitated him and Boscan in the style of his\r\npoetry. He died in Granada about the year 1580. There is elegance, and a\r\ncertain degree of originality in his poems. Sedano almost places him\r\nabove his friend Garcilaso. He mingled the Italian and old Spanish\r\nstyles together, introducing metres more adapted to the Castilian\r\nlanguage than the terzets of his predecessors, being shorter, more airy,\r\nand more graceful.\r\n\r\nGil Polo, a native of Valentia, flourished about the year 1550. He\r\ncontinued the Diana of Montemayor, and called his work \"La Diana\r\nEnamorada.\" He is chiefly famous for the praise that Cervantes bestows\r\non him, when in \"Don Quixote\" the curate says to the barber \"Take as\r\nmuch care of Gil Polo's work, as if it were written by Apollo himself.\"\r\nPosterity has not confirmed this preference, and it is chiefly praised\r\nfor elegance and purity of style.\r\n\r\nCetina, an anacreontic poet of merit, also finds a place in the \"Parnaso\r\nEspañol.\" The same honour is not bestowed on Castillejo, who, however,\r\ndeserves peculiar mention as the great partisan of the old Castilian\r\nstyle, and the antagonist of Boscan. Cristoval Castillejo flourished\r\nalso in the time of Charles V., in whose service he went to Vienna,\r\nremaining there as secretary to Ferdinand I.; as, notwithstanding, the\r\nimperial crown of Germany was separated from the regal one of Spain, on\r\nthe death of Charles V., there continued to subsist for some years\r\nintimate relations between the courts of Vienna and Madrid. The greater\r\npart of Castillejo's poems were written at Vienna, and are full of\r\nallusions to the gaieties of the court. He admired and celebrates a\r\nyoung German lady, named Schomburg, whose barbaric appellation he\r\ntranslates into Xomburg. Late in life he returned to Spain, became a\r\nCistercian monk, and died in a convent in 1596.\r\n\r\nSome Spanish critics raise Castillejo to a high rank among the poets of\r\nthat nation, while others give him a juster place, and perceive that it\r\nwas the want of strength to soar beyond, that led him, in his own\r\ncompositions, to confine himself to the old coplas, and want of\r\npenetration that made him so violent an enemy of those whom he named the\r\nPetrarquistas. His satires against them are witty, and not without some\r\njustice; and certainly prolixity is a fault to be attributed to these\r\npoets he attacks. He begins with the true Spanish taste for persecution,\r\nexclaiming,--\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the holy Inquisition\r\nIs apt, with saintly diligence,\r\nTo make eager perquisition,\r\nAnd punish too with violence,\r\nEach novel heresy and sect,\r\nI would that it were found correct\r\nTo castigate in native Spain\r\nA heresy as bad as any\r\nThat Luther, to our grief and pain,\r\nHas introduced in Germany.\r\nThe Anabaptists' crime they share,\r\nAnd well deserve their punishment:\r\nPetrarchists--the new name they bear,\r\nWhich they assume with bad intent;\r\nAnd they are renegades most fierce\r\nTo the old Castilian measure;\r\nBelieving in Italian verse.\r\nFinding there more grace and pleasure.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this, he institutes a ghostly tribunal, presided over by Juan de\r\nMena, Jorge Manrique, and other ancient poets, before whom Bosean and\r\nGarcilaso are forced to appear--of course, to their utter discomfiture\r\nand disgrace. While it is impossible to accede to this sentence, and\r\nwhile we must look on Castillejo as an inferior poet, he merits great\r\npraise within the boundaries which he prescribes himself. His lyrics are\r\nlight, airy, graceful; and though they possess a fault little known in\r\nSpain--that of levity,--this defect is with him akin to that animation\r\nand wit which is the proper charm of poetry of this class.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: \"Pues la santa Inquisicion\r\nsuele ser tan diligente,\r\nen castigar con razon\r\nqualquier secta y opinion\r\nlevantada nuevamente:\r\nresucitese luzero\r\ná castigar en España\r\nuna muy nueva y estraña,\r\ncomo á quello de Lutero\r\nen las partes de Alemaña.\r\nBien se pueden castigar\r\ná cuenta de Anabaptistas\r\npues por ley particular\r\nse tornan á baptizar\r\ny se llaman Petrarquistas\r\nHan renegado la fé\r\nde la trobas Castellanas\r\ny tras las Italianas\r\nse pierden, diziendo, que\r\nson mas ricas y galanas.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFERNANDO DE ROXAS\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMATISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in no long process of time, dramatic poetry became the distinctive\r\nand national turn of Spanish poetic genius, it would be ungrateful\r\ntowards the originators of a species of composition imitated all over\r\nthe world, and extolled by every man of taste, not to make mention of\r\nthem. The first dawn of the drama has been mentioned: the representation\r\nof mysteries and autos being permitted by the clergy, leave was taken to\r\nexchange the purely religious for the pastoral or the moral. Besides the\r\npastoral dialogues of Juan de Encina, before mentioned, there existed a\r\nmoral Spanish play, whose origin is lost in obscurity. It is named,\r\n\"Celestina, Tragicomedia de Calisto y Melibea.\" The first act is\r\nsupposed by some to have been the work of an unknown priest or poet of\r\nthe reign of John II. It was finished in the fifteenth century, by\r\nFernando de Roxas. The drama consists of twenty-one acts, and is rather\r\na long-drawn tale in dialogue than a play. It is more didactic than\r\ndramatic; descriptive and moral. Its purpose was to warn youth by\r\ndisplaying the dangers of licentiousness; and many an odious personage\r\nand scene is introduced to conduce to this good end; with considerable\r\ndisdain, meanwhile, of good taste. The first act, of ancient date,\r\nbrings forward the story--the loves of Calisto and Melibea, two young\r\npersons nobly born, divided from each other by their respective\r\nfamilies. Melibea is perfectly virtuous and prudent, and submits to the\r\ncommands that prevent all communication between her and her lover.\r\nCalisto is less patient: he applies to Celestina, an old sort of\r\ngo-between, such as is frequent in a land of intrigue like Spain. Her\r\nartifices, her flatteries, her philtres, are all described and put in\r\naction; and the act breaks off under the expectation of what may be the\r\nresult of such an engine. Roxas added twenty acts to this one. He\r\nincreases the romantic and tragic interest of the tale. Celestina\r\nintroduces herself into Melibea's house. She corrupts the servants by\r\npresents; deludes the unfortunate girl by incantations, and induces her,\r\nat last, to yield to her lover. Her parents discover the intrigue;\r\nCelestina is poisoned; Calisto stabbed; and Melibea throws herself from\r\nthe top of a tower. According to some writers, where crime is punished\r\nin the end, the tale is moral: thus, this drama was regarded as a moral\r\ncomposition; at all events, it was popular: doubtless, it pictured the\r\nmanners of the times, and interested the readers as the novels of the\r\npresent day do, by shadowing forth the passions and events they\r\nthemselves experienced.\r\n\r\nThis was the first genuine Spanish play. In the beginning of the reign\r\nof Charles V., the theatre began to interest classic scholars; and the\r\nfirst step made towards improving the drama, was an attempt to introduce\r\nantique models. Villalobos, a physician of Charles V., translated the\r\nAmphitryon of Plautus, which was printed in 1515. Perez de Oliva made a\r\nliteral translation of the Electra of Sophocles. Oliva was a man of\r\ninfinite learning and zealous inquiry: passing through the universities\r\nof Salamanca and Alcala, he visited first Paris, and afterwards Rome,\r\nwhere he gave himself up to the study of letters. The road of\r\nadvancement was open to him in the papal palace at Rome, but he\r\nrenounced it to return to Spain. He became professor of philosophy and\r\ntheology in the university of Salamanca. One of his chief studies was\r\nhis own language, and he is much praised for the classical purity of his\r\nstyle. Sedano goes so far as to say that the diction of his translation,\r\nwhich he entitles \"La Venganza de Agamemnon,\" or, Agamemnon Avenged, \"is\r\nso perfect in all its parts--so full of harmony, elevation, purity,\r\nsweetness, and majesty, that it not only excuses the author for not\r\nhaving written in verse, but may rival the most renowned poetry.\" It\r\nseems strange to read this sentence, and to turn to the bald phraseology\r\nof the work itself: we cannot believe that this translation was ever\r\nacted. The first original tragedy published in Spain was the work of\r\nGeronimo Bermudez, a monk of the order of St. Dominic, a man of austere\r\nand pious life; but who joined a love of letters and poetry to his\r\ntheological studies. He wrote \"Nise Lastimosa,\" and \"Nise Laureada.\"\r\nInes de Castro, of whose name in the title he makes the anagram of Nise,\r\nbut who is properly named in the play, is the heroine of these dramas.\r\nThe first is by no means destitute of merit. The tale itself is of such\r\ntragic interest, that it naturally supports the dialogue, which is too\r\nlong drawn, and interrupted by choruses. The fourth act, however, rises\r\nsuperior to the rest, and is extremely beautiful. Ines pleads before the\r\nking for her life. She uses every argument suggested by justice, mercy,\r\nand parental affection to move him. The language is free from extraneous\r\nornament; tender elevated, and impassioned. It is impossible to read it\r\nwithout being moved by the depth and energy of its pathos. The second\r\nplay, the subject of which is the vengeance the infante don Pedro took\r\non her murderers when he ascended the throne, is a great falling off\r\nfrom the other. The plot is deficient--the dialogue tiresomely long--and\r\nthe catastrophe, though historically true, at once horrible and\r\nunpoetic.\r\n\r\nBesides these more classical productions, there were written various\r\nimitations of Celestina. They were all moral, for they all displayed in\r\nan elaborate manner the course of vice, and its punishment. Long drawn\r\nout--too real in their representation of vulgar crime, they neither\r\ninterested on the stage, nor pleased in the closet.\r\n\r\nThe greatest obscurity has enveloped the earliest regular dramas written\r\nin Spanish. They were the work of Bartolomé Torres Naharro, a native of\r\nEstremadura, and a priest. Torres Naharro was born in the little town of\r\nTore, near Badajos, on the frontiers of Portugal. Little is known of\r\nhim, except his reputation as a man of learning. After a shipwreck,\r\nwhich involved him in various adventures, he arrived at Rome, during the\r\npontificate of Leo X., and was patronised by that accomplished pope.\r\nNaples was then in the hands of the Spaniards, and Naharro's comedies\r\nwere doubtless represented in that city, whither Naharro himself\r\nremoved, driven from Rome by the difficulties in which his satirical\r\nworks involved him.[31]\r\n\r\nCervantes does not mention Naharro in his preface to his comedies, which\r\ncontains the best account we have of the origin of the Spanish drama.\r\nBut other writers, and among them the editor of Cervantes's comedies,\r\nmention him as the real inventor of the Spanish drama. His plays were\r\nwritten in verse; there is propriety in his characters and some elegance\r\nin his style. He brought in the intrigue of an involved story to support\r\nthe interest of his plays. They did not, however, obtain possession of\r\nthe stage in Spain.\r\n\r\nLope de Rueda followed him. The \"great Lope de Rueda\" Cervantes calls\r\nhim, adding that he was an excellent actor and a clever man. \"He was\r\nborn,\" he continues, \"at Seville, and was a goldbeater by trade. He was\r\nadmirable in pastoral poetry, and no one either before or after excelled\r\nhim in this species of composition. Although when I saw him I was a\r\nchild, and could not judge of the excellence of his verses, several have\r\nremained in my memory, and, recalling them now at a ripe age, I find\r\nthem worthy their reputation. In the time of this celebrated Spaniard,\r\nall the paraphernalia of a dramatic author and manager was contained in\r\na bag: it consisted of four white dresses for shepherds, trimmed with\r\ncopper gilt, four sets of false beards and wigs, and four crooks, more\r\nor less. The comedies were mere conversations, like eclogues, between\r\ntwo or three shepherds and a shepherdess, adorned and prolonged by two\r\nor three interludes of negresses, clowns or Biscayans. Lope performed\r\nthe various parts with all the truth and excellence in the world. At\r\nthat time there were no side scenes, no combats between Moors and\r\nChristians on horseback or on foot. There was no figure which arose, or\r\nappeared to rise, from the centre of the earth, through a trapdoor in\r\nthe theatre. His stage was formed of a few planks laid across benches,\r\nand so raised about four palms above the ground. Neither angels nor\r\nsouls descended from the sky: the only theatrical decoration was an old\r\ncurtain, held up by ropes on each side: it formed the back of the stage,\r\nand separated the behind scenes from the front. Behind were placed the\r\nmusicians, who sang some old romance to the music of a guitar.\"\r\n\r\nAs an actor himself Rueda doubtless could judge best of the public\r\ntaste. His own parts were those of fools, roguish servants, and Biscayan\r\nboors. His plays were collected by Timoneda, a bookseller of Valencia,\r\nbut, like the witticisms of the masks of the old Italian stage, they\r\nlose much in print. His plots consist of chapters of mistakes: there are\r\na multitude of characters in his dramas, and jests and witticisms\r\nabound. These generally consist of ridiculous quarrels, in which a clown\r\nplays the principal part.[32] Spanish critics call him the restorer, it\r\nwould be better to say--the founder of the Spanish theatre.\r\n\r\nAfter Rueda, Cervantes tells us, came another Naharro, a native of\r\nToledo; he was also an actor and manager. \"He augmented the decorations\r\nof the comedies; he substituted trunks and boxes for the old bag. He\r\ndrew the musicians out from behind the curtain, where they were\r\npreviously placed. He deprived the actors of their beards; for before\r\nhim no actor had ever appeared without a false beard. He desired that\r\nall should show an unmasked battery, except those who represented old\r\nmen, or were disguised. He invented side scenes, clouds, thunder,\r\nlightning, challenges, and battles.\r\n\r\nSuch were the commencements of the Spanish theatre, destined to take so\r\nhigh a place hereafter in the history of the drama.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a new era, and names more known. We have arrived at the\r\nage of Cervantes: these were the men who preceded him.\r\n\r\nThere is something very peculiar in the state of literature at this\r\ntime. The infancy of Spanish poetry was such as might have been expected\r\nfrom a chivalrous nation; its themes were love and war, its heroes\r\nnational, and its style such as to render it popular. The continued\r\nstruggle with a foreign conqueror gave an ardent and gallant turn to the\r\nnational character: and while the superior excellence of the enemy in\r\narts and literature imparted some portion of refinement, national\r\nenthusiasm inspired independence. But now the enemy was quelled, the\r\ncountry overflowed with money, the harvest of the most nefarious\r\ncruelties, and the inquisition was established. Even these circumstances\r\nwere not enough to subdue the heroism of the Spanish character: they\r\nmade a stand for freedom against the encroachments of the monarchs;\r\ntheir disjointed councils caused them to fail, and from that moment they\r\nsank. The wars of Charles V. drained the country of men and money; the\r\nLutheran heresy put fresh powers into the hands of the inquisition; a\r\ncareer of arms in a foreign country was all that was left; the gates of\r\ninquiry and free thought were closed and barred.\r\n\r\nIntercourse with Italy opened fresh fields of poetry, which all other\r\ncountries have found unlimited in the variety of subjects, and manner of\r\ntreating them. Not so the Spaniards; they stopt short at once with\r\nelegies, and pastorals, and songs. Boscan, a man of gentle disposition\r\nand retired habits, naturally dwelt with complacency on descriptions of\r\nrural pleasures, or the sentiments of his own heart. Garcilaso de la\r\nVega, a gallant soldier, found in poetry a recreation, a mode to gratify\r\nhis taste; and retired from the world of arms to brood over the graceful\r\nand passionate reveries of a young lover. Mendoza, a man of harder\r\ntemperament, was the servant of a king: a sort of worldly philosophy,\r\nHoratian in its expression, or the passion of love, inspired his\r\nwritings at first; and when, later in life, he might be supposed to\r\nentertain the design of making his talents subservient to the good of\r\nmankind, he found, when he wrote the wars of Granada, the political and\r\ninquisitorial yoke so heavy that he could only hint at injuries, and\r\nallude to wrongs. The poets who came after were men of an inferior\r\ngrade; they wrote in a great measure to please their contemporaries;\r\nthey adopted, therefore, pastoral themes, they wrote elegies, sonnets;\r\nand love and scenic descriptions were the subjects of their\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nIn all this, it is not to be supposed that they were servile imitators\r\nof the Italians; they were at first their pupils, but nothing more.\r\nOriginality is the great distinctive of the Spanish character. Every\r\nline each author wrote was in its turn of thought and expression\r\nnational. The conceits resulting from a meeting of ardent imaginations\r\nwith ardent passions, which brought the whole phenomena of nature in the\r\npoet's service,--the burning emotions, the very constant brooding on one\r\nengrossing subject,--all belonged to a people whose souls were fiery,\r\nproud, and concentrated.\r\n\r\nStill the Spaniards had found no peculiar form in which to embody the\r\ncharacteristics of the nation. Perhaps the gay sally of a youthful\r\nstudent. Lazarillo de Tormes, of Mendoza, was the most national work yet\r\nproduced. In Italy the sort of free epic, introduced by Bojardo, became\r\nthe expression of national tastes and character. This sort of\r\ncomposition never took deep root in Spain. The authors were too\r\ncircumvented by the inquisition to dare say much; thus we shall find in\r\nthe end, that the theatre became the body informed by Spanish poets with\r\na soul all their own, where passions and imaginations, the most ardent\r\nand the most wild, the most true and the most beautiful, found\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nAll the authors hitherto mentioned were horn at the very commencement of\r\nthe sixteenth century. By the time they had arrived at the age of\r\nmanhood, the policy and success of Charles V. had established him firmly\r\non the Spanish throne, and was extending far and wide the glory of his\r\nname. To fight for and to serve him was the Spaniards' duty: they had\r\nnot yet suffered by the yoke, but they had yielded to it. At first the\r\nnobles of the land were the sole authors, while writing was merely a\r\ntaste, a study, or an amusement; soon it was followed, for purposes of\r\ngain and reputation by men of inferior rank, who were endowed with\r\ngenius; authorship became general; and poetry grew into one of the chief\r\npleasures of the court.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Bouterwek. Pellicer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Bouterwek.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERCILLA\r\n\r\n1533-1600.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish muse has produced numerous epic poems, most of which are\r\nunknown beyond the limits of Spain, and many even there have been\r\nconsigned to merited oblivion. The Araucana alone has been admitted to a\r\nstation in general literature. This is owing partly to its own intrinsic\r\nmerits, but in a greater degree to the novelty of its argument, and to\r\nthe circumstances under which it was written. Unlike other poets,\r\n_Ercilla_ was himself an actor in the scenes which he describes. The\r\nchronicler of his own story, he avowedly rejects the aid of fiction.\r\nVeracity and accuracy are the qualities in winch, as a poetical writer,\r\nhe is peculiar. His descriptions and characters are portraits taken from\r\nnature; invention is therefore a talent which he never exerts. If his\r\nimagination has any play, it is only in the grouping and distribution of\r\nhis pictures. His scenery, his manners, his personages, are all copied\r\nfrom originals which he had actually before his eyes. The objects of his\r\nobservation, the subject-matter of his poetry, were, moreover, of a\r\nclass strikingly novel,--a new world, savage nations, for the first time\r\nbrought into contact and collision with civilised man: on one side the\r\nlove of independence; on the other, the thirst of plunder, the fury of\r\nreligious zeal, and a misguided spirit of chivalrous enterprise. No\r\nordinary talents were required to do justice to so rich a theme, whilst\r\neven ordinary abilities were sufficient to give interest to a poem\r\nfounded on such a basis. To great genius the Spanish poet cannot lay a\r\nclaim; he is indeed inferior to his labour: yet he had that cleverness\r\nrequisite to produce a work not totally devoid of interest, occasionally\r\nabounding in beauties; such, in short, as entitles him to a respectable\r\nthough not a very high station in the literary world.\r\n\r\nDon Alonso de Ercilla was born in Madrid on the 7th of March, 1533.\r\n[Note 1.] His family was noble; by which word a meaning is conveyed\r\ndifferent from that attached in this country to the notion of nobility,\r\nit being tantamount to saying that his ancestors were and had been for a\r\nlong time gentlemen. Fortun Garcia de Ercilla, the father of Ercilla, a\r\nnative of Biscay, was an industrious writer, whose labours as a jurist\r\nwere highly prized, and obtained for him the cognomen of the \"subtle\r\nSpaniard.\" He wrote generally in Latin, though a Spanish manuscript work\r\nof his upon the challenge sent by the emperor Charles V. to Francis I.\r\nking of France is recorded by the author of the Bibliotheca Hispana.\r\n[Note 2.] Fortun's wife. Doña Leonor de Zuñiga (ladies in Spain do not\r\ntake their husband's names), was a woman of illustrious descent, the\r\nfeudal lady of the town of Bobadilla, the domain of which, after her\r\nhusband's death, was transferred to the crown, she having been admitted\r\ninto the household of the empress. Three sons were the offspring of\r\ntheir union, of whom Alonso the poet was the youngest. He received his\r\neducation at the royal palace, and since his tender years became a\r\n_menino_ [Note 3.], or page of the heir to the crown, prince Philip,\r\nafterwards so famous as Philip II. of Spain. What sort of education he\r\nreceived under such circumstances we are not enabled to say. It is not\r\nprobable that it was one suited to a man intended for literary pursuits.\r\nHis works, however, prove him not to have been unacquainted with the\r\nLatin and Italian poets; and though his knowledge of the latter was\r\nprobably acquired in the course of his travels, he must have been\r\nindebted to his early studies for his introduction to the former. The\r\nwords \"gentleman\" and \"soldier\" were at that time nearly synonymous; and\r\nDon Alonso, though bred a courtier, and following his royal master in\r\nthat capacity, was probably considered to be intended for the military\r\nprofession. In his earlier years Philip was directed by his father to\r\ntravel over his future extensive dominions, which formed a very\r\nconsiderable, and, with the exception of France, at that time the best,\r\npart of Europe. In this tour Ercilla was a constant attendant of the\r\nyoung prince, profiting, as he himself boasts[33], by his travels,\r\nindulging his own inquisitive propensities, and, in imitation of\r\nUlysses, acquiring an ample store of information and wisdom, derived\r\nfrom his observations of nations and manners. [Note 4.]\r\n\r\nThe ambition of Charles V. was not satisfied with the possession of\r\nSpain, Germany, the Netherlands, great part of Italy, and the countries\r\nrecently discovered in America. The rich inheritance which he intended\r\nto transmit to his son was to be increased, and as a compensation for\r\nthe loss of the empire of Germany, to which his brother Ferdinand had\r\nbeen elected successor, he aspired to the crown of England for the\r\nfuture king of Spain. A marriage between Philip and the English queen\r\nMary was brought about; the young prince repaired to London, attended by\r\nErcilla. During their residence in this metropolis, news reached them\r\nthat the Araucanos, an Indian tribe in South America, had risen against\r\nthe power of Spain. The insurrection appeared of a more serious nature\r\nthan those which had hitherto occurred in the annals of Indian warfare.\r\nThe charge of subduing the refractory patriots, or, as they were called\r\nby their invaders, the rebels, was committed to Geronimo de Alderete,\r\nwho had come over from Peru to England, and soon set out again on his\r\nreturn, having been appointed, by the king, adelantado of Chili,--a\r\ntitle since become obsolete, which was equivalent to hat of military\r\ncommander of a district. To a man of Ercilla's adventurous disposition,\r\nthis opportunity of military honour was too tempting to be resisted. He\r\nleft the personal service of the prince, to follow the adelantado in his\r\ndistant expedition, and girded on his sword[34], as he himself says, for\r\nthe first time, being then in the twenty-first year of his age. Geronimo\r\nde Alderete, however, did not reach the scene of warfare, having died\r\nwhile on his way, in Taboga near Panama. His young companion proceeded\r\nalone to Lima, the metropolis of Peru, to join the expedition.\r\n\r\nThose distant possessions, which, for the most part, had been annexed to\r\nthe Spanish crown by the prowess of obscure and enterprising\r\nadventurers, had already begun to rank high in the public estimation,\r\nand individuals of noble birth and courtly favour sought to reap the\r\nfruits of the labours of the neglected discoverers and conquerors.\r\n\r\nDon Andres Hurtado de Mendoza, marquis of Cañete, was at that time\r\nviceroy of Peru; a man belonging to one of the oldest and most\r\nillustrious families in Spain.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman entrusted his son, Don Garcia, with the command of the\r\nforces destined to subdue the Araucanos. The expedition consisted of a\r\ncorps of two hundred and fifty men, who went by sea--a brilliant and\r\nwell armed and equipped band, as we are told by the Spanish historians\r\n[Note 5.]; and a nearly equal number which had been sent by land across\r\nthose extensive regions. With such inconsiderable forces did the\r\nSpaniards attempt to conquer and hold in subjection those immense\r\nregions of South America!\r\n\r\nThe expedition having reached the point of its destination, the war\r\nproved of a far more important nature than those hitherto waged with the\r\nnatives of the American continent. Unlike the Indians of the torrid\r\nzone, the Araucanos were a hardy and valiant race, whose courage was not\r\nless impetuous than persevering. They are described by a Spanish\r\nhistorian as \"a people exceedingly brave, robust, and swift, who\r\noutstrip the deer in the race; and of so strong a breath, that they\r\npersist in the course for a whole day; superior to other Indian tribes,\r\nas well in the strength of their frames as in the vigour of their\r\nintellects; strong, ferocious, arrogant; filled with a generous spirit,\r\nand thus averse to subjection, to avoid which they readily peril their\r\nlives.[35] \"Though masters,\" says Ercilla[36], \"only of a district of\r\ntwenty leagues' extent, without a single town, or a wall, or a\r\nstronghold in it, destitute even of arms, inhabiting an almost flat\r\ncountry, surrounded by three Spanish towns and two fortresses, they, by\r\ndint merely of their valour and tenacity of purpose, not only recovered,\r\nbut supported and maintained, their freedom.\" Their gallant stand\r\nagainst the invaders of America was at last crowned with success.\r\nInstead of the subjects, they became the honourable foes, and in process\r\nof time the allies and friends, of the Spanish monarchy. The poverty of\r\ntheir native land proved their best auxiliary; it deterred the Spaniards\r\nfrom persisting in a contest in which nothing was to be gained which\r\ncould repay their exertions; and so completely was the animosity of\r\nthose nations changed into feelings of mutual esteem, that in the late\r\nevents, which have severed the colonies from their mother-country, the\r\nAraucanos have constantly shown, and still preserve, the most decided\r\npartiality to the cause and fortunes of the old Spaniards.\r\n\r\nIn the conflicts of that Indian war Ercilla was eminently distinguished,\r\naccording to the testimony of nearly all the Spanish writers [Note 6.],\r\nand to his own rather boastful account. He had an ample opportunity to\r\nindulge his daring spirit of enterprise and his habits of observation.\r\nAfter the tumult of a battle, or the toils of a march, he devoted the\r\nhours of night to write his half poetical, half historical, narration;\r\nwielding, as he says, by turns the sword and the pen, and writing often\r\nupon skins, and sometimes upon scraps of paper so small as to contain\r\nscarcely six lines. The ordinary duties, which he shared in common with\r\nhis fellow-soldiers, were insufficient for his aspiring ambition, and as\r\nlittle did the matter for observation on men and countries, although the\r\nsupply was unusually copious, satisfy the cravings of his inquisitive\r\nmind. Determined to accomplish more, he penetrated into the furthermost\r\nparts of the South American continent; left the army, in company with\r\nten of his fellow-soldiers; crossed twice, in a small boat, the\r\ndangerous pass of the archipelago of Ancudbox; and in the same manner,\r\nthough with less of gasconade [Note 7.] than was long after shown by an\r\nenterprising French traveller, in an opposite region of the earth,\r\ncarved upon a tree a record of his having, first of all human beings,\r\nreached that distant spot.\r\n\r\nUpon his return from this expedition, Don Alonso narrowly escaped an\r\nearly and disastrous end. News having been received at the city of _La\r\nImperial_, where the head-quarters of the Spanish army were fixed, that\r\nPhilip II. had succeeded to the Spanish crown in consequence of the\r\nabdication of his father, it was thought proper to solemnise the event\r\nby holding a tournament, after the fashion of those days of martial\r\nspirit, chivalrous feeling, and imperfect civilisation. Among the\r\nvarious shows and feats of skill there was an _estafermo_, a figure of\r\nwood or pasteboard, in striking which knights made a trial of their\r\nstrength and dexterity. Don Alonso de Ercilla and a cavalier called Don\r\nJuan de Pineda had a dispute, each pretending to have struck the best\r\nblow. They soon passed from mock to real battle, drew their swords, and\r\nwere followed by their respective partisans; so that the games, as not\r\nunfrequently happened in those martial amusements, were converted into\r\nstrife and confusion. The general having, it is said, previously\r\nsuspected the existence of a plot against his authority, concluded that\r\nthis encounter at the games was meant to be the precursor of its\r\nexecution. The civil wars, which had arisen in rapid succession among\r\nthe invaders and conquerors of that part of South America, gave\r\ncountenance to this impression. The pretended ringleaders were therefore\r\ncommitted to prison; and the irritated general, being desirous of making\r\na salutary example, to preserve discipline among his troops, ordered\r\nthat the heads of the criminals should be cut off. The riot being\r\nquelled, and more correct information having convinced Don Garcia that\r\nthe quarrel had been accidental, the severe sentence was revoked.[37] Of\r\nthe treatment which he then suffered, Ercilla complains bitterly in his\r\npoem. He states that he was actually taken to a public place, there to\r\nbe beheaded by sentence of a young and hasty general[38]; nay, that he\r\nhad been already upon the scaffold, and had stretched out his neck for\r\nthe axe, whilst he was only guilty of having unsheathed his sword, which\r\nhe never drew without being most clearly in the right.[39] The historian\r\nof Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, on the other side, pretends that he\r\nhad been justly condemned by the general, a person, in the opinion of\r\nhis panegyrist, to whom, by confession of all, no blame could attach, of\r\nan exceedingly mild and humane disposition[40], endowed with great\r\nequanimity, an acute intellect, and a fine memory, a perfect Christian,\r\nof marvellous prudence and activity, no gambler, a zealous restorer of\r\ndiscipline, highly abstemious, never tasting wine, and, to crown all,\r\nconstantly keeping in hand his rosary to tell his beads.[41] He,\r\nmoreover, affirms that our poet was indebted to Don Garcia for many\r\nfavours; but that he hated Ortigosa, the general's secretary, whom he\r\ntaxed with cowardice and incompetency for his office.[42] It is\r\nimpossible, and would be foreign to our present purpose, to settle this\r\nquestion. If Ercilla's testimony in his own case ought to be little\r\nattended to, the adulatory style of Don Garcia's eulogiser renders his\r\nassertions and opinions no less liable to suspicion and unworthy of\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nThough the sentence of death passed upon Don Alonso was revoked, he had\r\nto undergo a long imprisonment, which terminated, as we are informed, in\r\nhis being banished. We are at a loss how to reconcile this statement\r\nwith his own assertion, that he was, nevertheless, present at the\r\nseveral sieges and engagements which took place in those countries after\r\nthe accident of which mention has been made. Not long after, he left\r\nChili in disgust, without having been duly rewarded for his services.\r\nThis fact appears to contradict Suarez de Figueroa, who says that he was\r\nunder many obligations to Don Garcia[43]; but what these obligations\r\nwere the historian has not stated; and, as has been observed by the\r\nwriter of Ercilla's life prefixed to the edition of the Araucana of 1776\r\n(p. 22.), it is evident from the narration of that prejudiced author,\r\nthat in a distribution of rewards, which took place under the general,\r\nour poet received none.\r\n\r\nA new field of exertion seemed now opened to the martial bard. A spirit\r\nof dissension and civil strife had prevailed among the conquerors of\r\nPeru ever since their establishment in those regions, where, to borrow\r\nthe expression of the chief historian of Spanish America, \"there had\r\noccurred frequent instances of disloyalty and disobedience, cruel\r\nmurders, and various other crimes, two of the king's lieutenants having\r\nbeen deprived of their authority and imprisoned; the tribunals having\r\nbeen reduced to utter insignificance; the power of the crown and justice\r\nusurped and trampled upon; and five civil wars had taken place, in which\r\nmen became furiously enraged against each other, and fought with inhuman\r\nferocity, till ultimately the prince prevailed.\"[44] One of the most\r\nfamous \"tyrants\" of those times (for such was the appellation bestowed\r\nby the Spaniards upon those who usurped the royal authority) was Lope de\r\nAguirre, a native of Guipuzcoa, who, having been sent upon an expedition\r\nto quell some Indians, raised the standard of revolt against the Spanish\r\ncommanders, and ruled for a time over the provinces of Venezuela. Of his\r\nextraordinary cruelties much has been said, and they are still preserved\r\nby tradition, though, perhaps, with that exaggeration of blame which\r\nconstantly attaches to the memory of an unsuccessful rebel. In the style\r\nof the age, Ercilla compares him to Herod and Nero[45]; he having caused\r\nhis own daughter to be put to death. But before our poet had been able\r\nto reach the scene of this civil war, the usurper had been defeated,\r\ntaken, and executed. Nothing now remained for him to do, as the country\r\nwas peaceable. He therefore determined to return to Europe, which at\r\nthat time, however, a long and painful illness prevented. Having at\r\nlength recovered, he left the American continent, proceeded to the\r\nTerceiras, and thence to Spain. At this period (1562), his age being\r\nonly twenty-nine years, he was in the full and active vigour of life,\r\nand had lost none of that spirit which impelled him to enterprise and\r\ndiscovery. He accordingly had scarcely returned to his native country,\r\nwhen the restless energy of his mind sent him forth upon new travels. He\r\nvisited France, Italy, Germany, Silesia, Moravia, and Pannonia.[46]\r\nHaving gone back to Spain, he married, at Madrid, Doña Maria de Bazan,\r\na damsel of rank, whose mother held a place at court as lady of the\r\nbedchamber to the Spanish queen. The manner in which he speaks of his\r\nmarriage is quaint and singular: he represents himself to have been\r\ncarried away by Bellona, in a dream, over a widely extended and flowery\r\nmeadow, where, while he was intent upon devoting himself to amorous\r\nsongs, he felt an invincible curiosity to be informed of the names of\r\nthe beautiful damsels who inhabited that region, especially of one of\r\nthem, who was such that he suddenly lay prostrate at her feet. She was\r\nof tender age, yet she showed a maturity of judgment and talent much\r\nabove her time of life. While the poet felt compelled to gaze upon her,\r\nand while entranced and captivated by the contemplation of her beauty,\r\nhe anxiously wished to know her name, he saw at her feet the motto, or\r\ninscription, \"This is Doña Maria, a branch of the stem of Bazan.\"\r\n\r\nThough the emperor and queen of Spain had stood sponsors to the happy\r\npair ]Note 8.] Ercilla does not appear to have obtained any rewards or\r\npromotion. The emperor of Germany, Maximilian II., however, appointed\r\nhim his chambellan, a distinction which did little to better his\r\nfortune. In 1580, he lived in Madrid, poor and neglected, and\r\naccordingly complaining of the disregard with which his services both at\r\ncourt and in the camp had been treated. The stream of fortune (he says)\r\nran constantly against him: he was now in a state of perfect destitution\r\nand abandonment, yet he had the consciousness of having merited, by a\r\nlong course of honourable service, the just recompence which was\r\nwithheld from him; a consciousness which is itself a. reward, of which\r\nthe man of rectitude and honour can never be deprived by external\r\ncircumstances.[47]\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote is recorded respecting Ercilla at this\r\ntime:--Having waited to pay his court to the king, and wishing to speak\r\nto his majesty, he felt so disconcerted that he could not find words to\r\ndeclare the nature of his requests; and the king being well aware of the\r\ntemper of the man who was before him, and sure that his timidity arose\r\nfrom the respect he bore to royalty, told him--\"_Don Alonso, address me\r\nby writing._\" So Ercilla did (says the author from whom this story has\r\nbeen taken[48]), and the king granted his request.\r\n\r\nWhat the nature of this request was it is impossible to ascertain,\r\nbecause Ercilla constantly complains of his having been totally\r\nneglected and forgotten. The anecdote, moreover, seems doubtful. Though\r\na soldier, Don Alonso was not a blunt one: he had been brought up at\r\ncourt, nay, within the precincts of the palace, and as a youthful\r\nattendant on the person of that prince, whom now he is represented to\r\nhave looked upon with such feelings of reverential terror. On the other\r\nhand, the account is not entirely devoid of probability, and if not\r\ntrue, is, at least, well imagined. The gloomy and stem disposition of\r\nPhilip appears to have struck even his confidential servants with a sort\r\nof respect bordering upon fear; and the notions of the divine attributes\r\nof royalty were then carried to the most extravagant lengths by the\r\nSpaniards; a feeling which can be traced in the Spanish writers down to\r\na very recent period, and which has only disappeared in consequence of\r\nthe late revolutions in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe last years of Ercilla's life were spent in obscurity. The\r\ndisappointments he had met with engendered a spirit of gloomy devotion,\r\nto which his countrymen were, in those days, peculiarly liable.[49] His\r\nmorals in his juvenile years had been loose, as is proved by the\r\ncircumstance of his having had a numerous illegitimate offspring. He now\r\nbitterly repented of his frailties; and lamented that he had devoted the\r\nbest years of his life to worldly pursuits and vanities.[50] The year of\r\nhis death is not known. In 1596 he was still alive, and is said to have\r\nbeen engaged in writing a poem to commemorate the exploits of Don Alvaro\r\nBazan, marquis of Santa Cruz, the bravest and most fortunate of the\r\nSpanish naval commanders. This work, if it ever existed, has been lost;\r\nand Ercilla is only known in the literary world by his poem La Araucana,\r\nand by a few lines printed in the Parnaso Español[51], which, though\r\nthey were highly extolled by Lope de Vega, certainly do no credit to his\r\npoetical powers.\r\n\r\nRespecting Ercilla's personal character we possess little information.\r\nHe appears to have been brave, active, and clever, of an adventurous\r\ndisposition, impatient of control, restless and querulous. That he, like\r\nmost of the literary men of Spain, was shamefully neglected by his own\r\ncountrymen, is an incontrovertible fact. In his account of the Indian\r\nwar, and of his own share in the events of it, he shows himself to have\r\nbeen actuated by a more liberal spirit, towards the aboriginal natives,\r\nthan was evinced by the generality of his fellow-soldiers and\r\nfellow-writers. That this arose from his discontent has been malignantly\r\nasserted by his enemies, but without sufficient evidence. The execution\r\nof Caupolican, the Indian general, which he so indignantly condemns, was\r\na fact of glaring and atrocious injustice, though, unfortunately, of a\r\nclass by no means uncommon, not only in the annals of Spanish warfare in\r\nthose regions, but in the history of all conquests; where the assertion\r\nof independence has been held and treated as rebellion, and punishment\r\nthe more severely inflicted in proportion as the right to inflict it was\r\nmore doubtful or untenable. But as the name of Ercilla belongs rather to\r\nthe literary than to the political history of Spain, the qualities of\r\nhis poetry demand our attention in preference to the actions of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe Araucana, though often quoted, is little known out of Spain. No\r\nEnglish version of it has been published, but it is stated in an article\r\nin the Quarterly Review[52], that there exists one in manuscript from\r\nthe pen of Mr. Boyd, known as one of the English translators of Dante.\r\nThe writer of Ercilla's life, in the French Biographie Universelle,\r\nspeaks of a French translation by M. Langlès, also unpublished. We are\r\nnot aware that either the Italians or the Germans, the latter of whom\r\nhave latterly directed their attention to Castilian poetry, possess any\r\ncomplete translation of that Spanish poem.\r\n\r\nVoltaire was the first, amongst the French, who called the attention of\r\nhis countrymen to the Araucana. In his very indifferent Essay upon Epic\r\nPoetry, he praises the speech of Colocolo in the 2d canto, which he\r\nplaces above that of Nestor in the first book of the Iliad, and says\r\nthat the remainder of the work is as barbarous as the nations of which\r\nit treats.[53] Of the excellence of the speech so praised (without\r\nmeaning to enter into a comparison with Homer) no doubt can exist, and\r\nthe judgment passed upon it by Voltaire deserves the more to be relied\r\nupon, as, according to Bouterwek's acute remark[54], he was a better\r\njudge of rhetorical than of poetical excellence. The unqualified\r\ncondemnation of the rest of the poem cannot, indeed, be assented to;\r\nfor, though the Araucana is far from being a work of first-rate merit,\r\nyet it contains some manly beauties, which Voltaire's notions of poetry\r\nrendered him unable to perceive. [Note 9.] In an article of Moreri's\r\nDictionnaire we find a more just though still a severe criticism of\r\nErcilla's poem. Latterly the writer in the Biographic Universelle\r\nalready quoted has expressed a more favourable opinion of the Araucana,\r\nand has perhaps erred on the other side. [Note 10.]\r\n\r\nIt is to Hayley that the English are indebted for a knowledge of the\r\nwork in question: his analysis and partial translations of it, and his\r\neulogium upon the author, are contained in the notes and body of his\r\nEssay upon Epic Poetry. [Note 11.] Hayley thought of Ercilla, perhaps,\r\nmore highly than he deserves; though, upon the whole, his notice of the\r\nAraucana is judicious. In his translations he was not quite so\r\nfelicitous: his prosaic style was not ill calculated to give a just\r\nnotion of the tenour of the Spanish poet's composition; but he wanted\r\nthat force of expression which constitutes the highest recommendation of\r\nErcilla's poetry. The translator, besides, adopted the couplet, a very\r\nimproper medium to convey to an English reader a just notion of a work\r\noriginally written in the stanza. It would be needless to point out to\r\nthose who are acquainted with the Spenserian stanza, or with the Italian\r\nand Spanish octava, so happily adopted by Fairfax in his Tasso, how far\r\nthe mechanism of this measure affects the original conception and\r\ndistribution of the poet's thoughts, and how much the structure of the\r\ncouplet differs from it; whence it follows, as a necessary consequence,\r\nthat conceptions originally adapted to the former must appear distorted\r\nwhen brought by a forced adaptation to the latter.\r\n\r\nFrom the discordant opinions of critics of all nations respecting the\r\nAraucana, we may safely infer that, although its defects may be great\r\nand numerous, and although even in the Castilian language it cannot be\r\nesteemed a first-rate poem, still it possesses just pretensions to a\r\nrank in literature above that which some would assign to it.\r\n\r\nThat Ercilla only meant to write a rhymed history cannot be justly\r\nasserted. His fictions, though most of them infelicitous, and\r\nunconnected with the main subjects of his story; his machinery; his\r\nimitations of Ariosto in the first stanzas of all his cantos, and\r\nespecially at the opening of the work; his frequent similes;--all\r\nclearly prove that he intended to write a poem. But the novel nature of\r\nhis arguments naturally suggested the idea of rendering his poem a\r\ncomposition far differing from those hitherto existing. He aimed at\r\nproducing a work, striking from its subject-matter, recommended by the\r\nveracity and accuracy of the information [Note 12.] which it was\r\ndestined to convey, yet clothed in a poetical style, and embellished by\r\nepisodes where historical fidelity might be easily departed from, and\r\nwould not, indeed, be expected on the part of the reader.\r\n\r\nDon Alonso, however, was deficient in many of the qualities which\r\nconstitute the poet: he wanted invention and command of language and\r\nversification; on the other hand, that which he conceived he could\r\nexpress with force, if not with correctness or delicacy. His adventurous\r\ndisposition seems to prove that the elements of poetry were in his mind.\r\nHe had no eyes for the beauties of nature; but he understood the\r\nworkings of the human heart. His warlike habits directed his attention\r\nto those fierce passions which rage in the warrior's breast. He could\r\ninterpret the feelings of the natives of those remote regions fighting\r\nfor their homes, their altars, and their personal independence, against\r\nthe invaders of their country; in his description of their characters\r\nand exploits, his style rises and his fancy kindles. By the force of\r\nmental association, he is thence led to the contemplation of animated\r\nnature; hence the frequency and beauty of his similes, drawn mostly from\r\nthe animal creation.\r\n\r\nIn his delineation of character there is abundant matter for praise: his\r\nIndians are well pourtrayed, though his Spaniards are all failures. From\r\nthis latter circumstance he has been accused of bearing ill-will to his\r\nfellow-soldiers; but upon a consideration of his peculiar powers, the\r\nreason of that difference will be easily explained without admitting the\r\ninvidious imputations thus cast upon him. Neither could his mind seize,\r\nnor his pen delineate, the complex character of civilised man; whilst\r\nthe bolder and simpler lineaments of the physiognomy of the savage were\r\nperfectly adapted to the nature of his genius and the extent of his\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\nThe want of unity is one of the greatest faults in the Araucana, as the\r\npoem is rendered thereby uninteresting. This defect does not arise\r\nsolely from the want of a hero; but likewise from the poet's inability\r\nto invent a story. Yet there are frequent instances of works, the plot\r\nof which is loose and unconnected, without losing much of their\r\nattractions. But in Ercilla, we miss the power of imparting interest,\r\neven to the separate stories which form his poem.\r\n\r\nErcilla's poem, on the whole, is rather deserving of censure than of\r\npraise; and, if read through, will certainly be found tedious; but parts\r\nof it may be perused with pleasure and admiration. The epithet of\r\nHomeric has been both applied and misapplied when bestowed upon his\r\ngenius. Those qualities which have been praised in him must be admitted\r\nby an impartial judge to savour a little of the style of the father of\r\nepic poetry. That Ercilla was at an immense distance from his model\r\nmust, however, be confessed, even by his warmest admirers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 1.--This date is taken from the life of Ercilla prefixed to the\r\nedition of the Araucana, of Madrid, 1776. The author of Ercilla's life\r\nin the French Biographie Universelle fixes his birth at Bermeo, in\r\nBiscay, in 1525. He was led into error as to the place by the collector\r\nof the Parnaso Español: in assigning the year he confesses that he had\r\nno foundation but his own conjecture. This spirit led him to fix a date\r\nfor our poet's death, which is uncertain.\r\n\r\nNote 2.--Nicolaus Antonius. Bibl. Hisp. Nov. p. 395. Madrid, 1783. It is\r\na remarkable fact, that while Ercilla the poet is slightly mentioned in\r\nthis work, his father, whose labours are now forgotten, has nearly two\r\ncolumns devoted to a notice of his life and writings.\r\n\r\nNote 3.--The _Meninos_ were young gentlemen attached to the court. The\r\nword is no longer used, though the office is preserved in that of the\r\nking's pages.\r\n\r\nNote 4.--The pedantic allusion, it is needless to say, is made by\r\nErcilla himself, in the taste of his age.\r\n\r\nNote 5.--Herrera Historia general de los Hechos de los Castellanos en\r\nlas Islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano. Dec. VIII. lib. VII. C. X. Our\r\npoet is there mentioned as the famous poet and honourable gentleman, Don\r\nAlonso de Ercilla.\r\n\r\nNote 6.--Licentiate Cristoval Mosquera de Figueroa speaks of Ercilla's\r\nprowess at the battle of Millarapue, and the engagement at Puren, where,\r\nfollowed by eleven fellow-soldiers, he climbed up a mountain defended by\r\nthe Indians, and won the day. The writer of Ercilla's life quotes the\r\nChronicle of Philip II., by Calvete de la Estrella, as a testimonial of\r\nthe poet's exploits, but this must be a mistake. There exists no such\r\nchronicle. Suarez de Figueroa only praises Don Alonso's gallant bearing\r\nat a mock fight or field-day (p. 60.); but he was prejudiced against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNote 7.--The last line of the inscription here alluded to,\r\n\r\nHic tandem stetimus nobis ubi defuit orbis,\r\n\r\nwas written by the French comic poet Regnard, in Lapland, in 1681.\r\nThough the thought is liable to the imputation of gasconade, it is\r\nspirited and beautiful. Ercilla's inscription was of a more unpretending\r\nnature. He merely says:--\r\n\r\n\"Here, where no one had reached before, arrived Don Alonso de Ercilla,\r\nwho, first of all men, crossed this pass in a small boat without\r\nballast, attended only by ten companions, in the year of fifty-eight\r\nabove fifteen hundred, on the last day of February, at two o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, returning afterwards to his companions whom he had left\r\nbehind.\"\r\n\r\nThis inscription forms a stanza of the Araucana. It is very prosaic.\r\nThis instance is not the only one where dates are mentioned in the poem.\r\nIn order to accommodate them to measure and rhyme, the author is often\r\ndriven to very curious shifts, and strange phraseology.\r\n\r\nNote 8.--Luis de Salazar Advertencias Historicas, p. 13. It has however,\r\nbeen remarked by the writer of Ercilla's life, that this author is wrong\r\nin stating, that Elizabeth, Philip's consort, or Isabel de Valois, acted\r\nas sponsor; she having died in 1568, and Ercilla having married in 1570,\r\naccording to Garibay. Possibly the queen alluded to was Philip's fourth\r\nwife, Ann of Austria.\r\n\r\nNote 9.--Dictionnaire Historique de Moreri, art. Ercilla. The subject of\r\nthe Araucana (says the critic) being novel, has suggested some novel\r\nthoughts to the poet; but his poem is too long, and abounds with low\r\npassages. There is great animation in his battles, but no invention, no\r\nplot, no variety in his descriptions, no unity in his general outline of\r\nthe work, &c.\r\n\r\nNote 10.--Biographie Univ., Paris, 1815, art. Ercilla. The merits of the\r\nAraucana (says this writer) consist in a correct style, proper imagery,\r\nbeautiful descriptions, a plot constantly increasing in interest, a sort\r\nof unity of action, and a spirit of heroism spread over the whole work.\r\nThe work is inferior to Tasso's Gerusalemme, and superior to Voltaire's\r\nHenriade. There occur in it some feeble lines, and vulgar or\r\ncommon-place thoughts.\r\n\r\nNote 11.--Ercilla's poetical character is drawn by Hayley in the\r\nfollowing lines:--\r\n\r\nWith warmth more temperate, and in notes more clear,\r\nThat with Homeric richness fills the ear,\r\nThe brave Ercilla sounds, with potent breath,\r\nHis epic trumpet in the fields of death;\r\nIn scenes of savage war, when Spain unfurled\r\nHer bloody banner o'er the Western world;\r\nWith all his country's virtues in his frame,\r\nWithout the base alloy that stained her name.\r\nIn danger's camp this military bard,\r\nWhom Cynthia saw on his nocturnal guard,\r\nRecorded, in his bold descriptive lay,\r\nThe various fortunes of the finished day;\r\nSeizing the pen, while night's calm hours afford\r\nA transient slumber to his satiate sword,\r\nWith noble justice his warm hand bestows\r\nThe meed of honour on his valiant foes.\r\nHowe'er precluded, by his generous aim,\r\nFrom high pretensions to inventive fame,\r\nHis strongly coloured scenes of sanguine strife,\r\nHis softer pictures, caught from Indian life,\r\nAbove the visionary forms of art,\r\nFire the awakened mind and melt the heart\r\n\r\n_Hayley, Essay upon Epic Poetry_, Epistle 3.\r\n\r\nNote 12.--It is a curious fact, that, to the Antwerp edition of the\r\nAraucana, 157., and to several others, there is affixed an approbation\r\nfrom captain Juan Gomez, praising Ercilla for his historical veracity,\r\nwhich he, the captain, could vouch for, from his having resided\r\ntwenty-seven years in Peru, near the scene of the Araucan war.

While the sublime character of Don Quixote warms\r\nthe heart of the enthusiast, the truth of the sad picture which his\r\nfortunes present tickles the fancy of the man of the world. Children\r\nrevel in the comedy, old men admire the shrewdness, of Sancho Panza.\r\nThat this work is written in prose increases its popularity. Imperfect\r\nas all translations must be, none fail so entirely as those which\r\nattempt to transfuse the etherial and delicate spirit of verse into\r\nanother language. But though to read \"Don Quixote\" in its native Spanish\r\ninfinitely increases the pleasure it affords, yet so does its mere\r\nmeaning speak to all mankind, that even a translation satisfies those\r\nwho are forced thus to content themselves.\r\n\r\nFor the honour of human nature, and to satisfy our own sense of\r\ngratitude, we desire to find that the author of \"Don Quixote\" enjoyed as\r\nmuch prosperity as is consistent with humanity, and that he tasted to\r\nits full the triumph due to the writer of the most successful hook in\r\nthe world. This satisfaction being denied us--for he was \"fallen on evil\r\ndays,\" a poor and neglected man--we are anxious, even at this distance\r\nof time, to commiserate his misfortunes, and sympathise in his sorrows.\r\nWe desire to learn with what spirit he endured adversity--whether, like\r\nhis heroic creation, he consoled himself at the worst by the sense of\r\nconscious worth and virtuous intention. We feel sure that his romantic\r\nimagination, and keen sense of humour, must often have elevated him\r\nabove his griefs or blunted their sting; but we wish to learn whether\r\nthey were borne with moral courage; and how far, like his hero, he\r\npreserved a serene and undaunted spirit in the midst of blows and\r\nderision.\r\n\r\nWe are disappointed at the outset by finding how little is known of so\r\nrenowned an author. Neglected during life, his memory also was\r\nunhonoured. His contemporaries gave themselves no trouble to collect and\r\nbequeath the circumstances of his life, so that they quickly became\r\ninvolved in obscurity. When, at last, it was endeavoured to do honour to\r\nhis name, eulogy, rather than biography, was written; and it was only\r\ntowards the end of the last century that pains were taken to make\r\nresearches, which so far succeeded, that such discoveries were made as\r\nplace various portions of his life in an interesting and romantic light.\r\nThe Spanish Academy published an edition of \"Don Quixote,\" to which is\r\nprefixed a biography, written by don Vicente de los Rios, who, with all\r\nthe ardour of an admirer of genius, spared no pains to render his work\r\nfull and accurate. At about the same time, don Juan Antonio Pellicer\r\nmade similar researches, and threw some new lights on his situation and\r\ncircumstances. Much more, however, has been done lately by a French\r\ngentleman of the name of Viardôt. He travelled in Spain, and exerted\r\nhimself to the utmost to discover the yet hidden circumstances of\r\nCervantes's life. By searching the archives of various cities where he\r\nhad resided, and by a careful examination of contemporary writers, he\r\nhas brought a mass of information together, the authenticity of which\r\nadds to its interest. Some circumstances, indeed, are important only as\r\nthey are true, and appertain to Cervantes; others throw a great light on\r\nhis character, and show his fortitude in suffering, his devoted courage\r\nwhen others depended on him, his cheerful content in poverty, his\r\nbenevolence, and the dignity and animation of his mind, which raised him\r\nabove his fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe first point to be decided was the place of his birth: this had been\r\nattributed to various cities and towns of Spain--to Madrid, Seville,\r\nEsquivias, and Lucena. An allusion in \"Don Quixote\" led one of his\r\nbiographers (Sarmiento) to conjecture that he was born at Alcalà de\r\nHenares, a town of some consequence, not far from Madrid. Another\r\nwriter, following up this trace, discovered a baptismal register in the\r\nparish church of Santa Maria la Mayor of that town, which certified,\r\nthat on Sunday, the 9th of October, 1547, the reverend señor Bachiller\r\nSerrano baptized Miguel, the son of Rodrigo Cervantes and donna Leonora,\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nWhile the question seemed thus put to rest, it was unsettled again by\r\nthe discovery of another register. This was found in the parish books of\r\nSanta Maria, of Alcanzar de San Lugar, a town of La Mancha. It\r\ncertified, that on the 9th November, 1558, was baptized, by the\r\nlicentiate Alonso Diaz Pajares, a son of Blas Cervantes Saavedra and\r\nCatalina Lopez, who received the name of Miguel. A marginal note to this\r\nregister declared, \"This was the author of 'Don Quixote.'\" In addition,\r\nthere were various traditions in Alcanzar of the house in which he was\r\nborn. The name of Saavedra was another testimony in its favour.\r\nCervantes always adopted this additional name; and no trace of it is to\r\nbe found in the town of Alcalà; however, it would seem that the\r\ndifferent families of these two towns were connected, as Cervantes had\r\nan uncle, Cervantes Saavedra, of Alcanzar. And thus, on minute\r\nexamination, and bringing the aid of chronology to decide the question,\r\nthe balance inclined uncontrovertibly in favour of Alcalà: the date of\r\nthe battle of Lepanto, and the mention Cervantes makes of his own age in\r\nseveral of his later works, prove that he was born in 1547, and not so\r\nlate as 1558. Another document, hereafter to be mentioned, discovered by\r\nLos Rios in the archives of the society for the redemption of captives\r\nin Algiers, declares him to be a native of Alcalà de Henares, and the\r\nson of Rodrigo Cervantes and donna Leonora de Cortina.\r\n[Sidenote: 1547.]\r\nThus the question is set at rest; and it becomes matter of positive\r\nhistory that Cervantes was born at Alcalá de Henares, and baptized\r\n(probably on the day of his birth, as is usual in catholic countries,)\r\non Sunday, the 9th of October, 1547.\r\n\r\nHis family, originally of Gallicia, and afterwards established in\r\nCastile, belonged to the same class in society, in which he places Hon\r\nQuixote. They were hidalgos (hijos de algo, sons of somebody,) and,\r\ntherefore, by right of birth, gentlemen, though not noble. The name of\r\nCervantes is honourably mentioned in the Spanish annals, as far back as\r\nthe thirteenth century. Warriors bearing that appellation fought under\r\nthe banners of St. Ferdinand, and had a part in the taking of Baeza and\r\nSeville, and received a share in the distributions of land conquered\r\nfrom the Moors, then made. Others of that name figure among the first\r\nadventurers in the New World. His grandfather, Juan de Cervantes, was\r\ncorregidor of Osuna. The mother of Miguel was of a noble family of\r\nBarajas; she married his father about the year 1540. Four children were\r\nthe fruit of the union; donna Andrea and donna Luisa, daughters;\r\nRodrigo, and youngest of the four, Miguel. His parents were poor, and he\r\ncould inherit little from them except his honourable rank.[55]\r\n\r\nVery little is known of his early life. The town of Henares is but a few\r\nmiles distant from Madrid, and it contains a university, where it is\r\nprobable that Cervantes prosecuted his early studies. He tells us, in a\r\npoem written late in life,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From my most tender years I loved\r\nThe gentle art of poesy,--\r\n\r\n\r\nand this taste gave the bias to his life. While still a boy he was\r\nattracted by the drama, and frequented the representations of Lope de\r\nRueda; these recitations, and his taste for reading, which was such that\r\nhe never passed the meanest bit of paper in the streets without\r\ndeciphering its contents, were the early proofs he gave of that love of\r\ninquiry which always accompanies genius.\r\n\r\nHaving attained the proper age, Miguel repaired to Salamanca, where he\r\nentered himself as a student, and remained for two years.[56] It is\r\nascertained that he lived in Calle los Moros. He afterwards returned to\r\nMadrid, and was placed to study with the learned Joan Lopez de Hoyos, a\r\ntheologian, who filled the chair for Belles Lettres in that city. It is\r\nconjectured that in giving him a literary education his parents meant\r\nthat he should pursue one of the liberal professions; but we have no\r\nother token that such was intended. He acquired, however, a taste for\r\nliterature, and aspired in his turn to be an author. He wrote, he tells\r\nus, an infinite number of what in Spain are called romances, being\r\nballads and ditties; of which later in life, he says, he considered a\r\nfew good among many bad. He wrote also a pastoral, called \"Filena,\"\r\nwhich he boasts attained celebrity. \"The woods resounded with her name,\"\r\nhe says; \"and many a gay song was echoed by them;--my many and pleasant\r\nrhymes and the light winds were burdened with my hopes, which were\r\nthemselves light as the breezes, and shifting as the sands.\"\r\n\r\nHis master, Juan Lopez de Hoyos, admired and encouraged him in these\r\npursuits, and, it would seem, endeavoured to bring him into notice. The\r\ndeath of Isabella of Valois, wife of Philip II., which happened in 1569,\r\nelicited the tribute of many an elegy from the poets of Madrid. The name\r\nof this queen is rendered romantic to us by its association with that of\r\nthe unfortunate prince don Carlos, and the legend of his unhappy\r\nattachment and consequent death. Of course these circumstances were not\r\nthe subject of verse intended for the royal ear; but Isabella was\r\nbeloved and mourned with more sincerity than queens usually are. Lopez\r\nde Hoyos published a book called \"History and true relation of the\r\nsickness, pious death, and sumptuous funeral obsequies, of the serene\r\nqueen of Spain, donna Isabella of Valois.\" This publication includes\r\nvarious elegies, one of which is thus introduced:--\"These Castilian\r\nredondillas on the death of her majesty, which, as appears, indulge in\r\nrhetorical imagery, and at the conclusion address her majesty, are by\r\nMiguel de Cervantes, cur dear and beloved pupil.\" Besides this, the book\r\ncontains another elegy addressed by the whole school to the cardinal\r\nEspinosa, also written by Cervantes. Neither of these poems give\r\npromise; they are common-place, wordy, and deficient both in sentiment\r\nand imagination.\r\n\r\nIn the same year that these poems were published Cervantes quitted\r\nMadrid. It is usually supposed that he left it in despair, to seek his\r\nfortune elsewhere; but there can be no doubt that he left it in the\r\nservice of cardinal Acquaviva. On the death of the queen, pope Pius V.\r\nsent a nuncio to Madrid to condole with Philip II., and to seek\r\ncompensation for certain dues of the church, denied by the king's\r\nministers at Milan. The nuncio was a Roman prelate, named Giulio\r\nAcquaviva son of the duke of Atri, who was created cardinal on his\r\nreturn to Italy. His mission displeased the king, who, bigot as he was,\r\nnever yielded any point to the court of Rome. He remained, therefore,\r\nbut a short time, receiving an order, two months after his arrival, to\r\nreturn to Italy by way of Valencia and Barcelona. As Cervantes himself\r\nmentions that he was at Rome immediately after in the household of the\r\ncardinal, there can be little doubt that he was preferred to this\r\nsituation while he was at Madrid.\r\n[Sidenote: 1568.\r\nÆtat.\r\n21.]\r\nPreferred, we say, because in those days the sons of poor gentlemen\r\noften began their early career in the households of princes, thus\r\nforming high connections, and securing a patron for life. We may believe\r\nthat the recommendation of De Hoyos, and the talents of the youth,\r\ninduced the cardinal to choose him. In the suite of his new master\r\nCervantes visited Valencia and Barcelona, and traversed the south of\r\nFrance,--places which he afterwards described in his writings, and which\r\nhe at no other time had an opportunity of visiting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1569.\r\nÆtat.\r\n22.]\r\n\r\nWhat hopes and views he nourished in his own heart on visiting Rome we\r\ncannot tell. He was now in his twenty-third year. His temperament was\r\nardent and aspiring, his tastes decidedly literary; but with no bent\r\ntowards the clerical profession. That he had hopes we cannot doubt; and\r\nlittle doubt is there that these hopes proved, as he says; \"light as the\r\nwinds and shifting as the sands;\" for he had not been a year at Rome\r\nwhen he changed the whole course of his life, and volunteered as a\r\nsoldier. \"The war against the Turks,\" his biographer, Los Rios,\r\nobserves, \"which was declared in 1570, gave him an opportunity of\r\nadopting a more noble profession, and one more consonant to his birth\r\nand valour;\" and we may remark, that whatever hardships he suffered in\r\nhis military career, Cervantes prided himself upon it to the end of his\r\nlife. He always calls himself a soldier; and his heart is in the\r\nargument, when Don Quixote, comparing the student's and the soldier's\r\nlife, gives preference to the latter as the more noble.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1570.\r\nÆtat.\r\n23.]\r\n\r\nTo return to the Turkish war, during which he served. The sultan Selim,\r\nbeing desirous of possessing himself of the island of Cyprus, broke the\r\npeace which he had made with the Venetian republic, and sent an armament\r\nfor the conquest of this island. The Venetians implored the aid of the\r\nChristian sovereigns. Pope Pius V., in consequence, sent a force,\r\ncommanded by Marco Antonio Colonna, duke of Paliano. Cervantes enlisted\r\nunder this general, and served during the campaign, which began late in\r\nthe year, the object of which was to succour Cyprus, and raise the siege\r\nof Nicosia. The dissentions among the commanders sent by the various\r\nChristian princes prevented, however, the good they were sent to do. The\r\nTurks took Nicosia by assault, and proceeded to other conquests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1571.\r\nÆtat.\r\n24.]\r\n\r\nDuring the following year greater efforts were made by the Christians.\r\nThe combined fleet of Venice, Spain, and of the pope, assembled at\r\nMessina. Marco Antonio Colonna continued to command the papal galleys,\r\nDoria the Venetians; while the combined forces of all parties were\r\nplaced under the command of don John of Austria, a gallant prince, the\r\nnatural son of the emperor Charles V. Cervantes served in the company of\r\nthe brave captain Diego de Urbino, a detachment of the tercio (regiment)\r\nof Miguel de Moncada.\r\n\r\nDon John collected at Barcelona all the veteran troops whom he had tried\r\nin the war against the Moriscos in Andalusia; and among others, the\r\nrenowned tercios of don Miguel de Moncada and don Lope de Figueroa; and,\r\nsailing for Italy, cast anchor off Genoa on the 26th June with\r\nforty-seven galleys. Thence he proceeded to Messina, where the combined\r\nfleet met. In the distribution now made of the troops on board the\r\nvarious vessels, the two new companies of veterans, taken from the\r\ntercios of Moncada, those of Urbina and Rodrigo de Mora, were embarked\r\non board the Italian galleys of Doria. Cervantes followed his captain on\r\nboard the Marquesa, commanded by Francesco Santo Pietro.[57]\r\n\r\nThe fleet of the confederates, after having succoured Corfu, went in\r\npursuit of the enemy, and found the Turkish fleet, on the morning of the\r\n7th October, in the entrance of the gulph of Lepanto. The battle began\r\nabout noon: the confederates achieved a splendid victory; but it was a\r\nvery sanguinary one, and, not being followed up by other successes, it\r\nremained a useless trophy of Christian valour.\r\n\r\nCervantes was at this time suffering from an intermittent fever, and his\r\ncaptain and comrades would have persuaded him to abstain from mingling\r\nin the fight; but he spurned the idea, and requested, on the contrary,\r\nto be placed in the post of honour, where there was most danger. He was\r\nposted near the shallop with twelve chosen soldiers. The galley, on\r\nboard of which he was, distinguished itself in the action: it boarded\r\nthe Captain of Alexandria, killed near five hundred Turks with their\r\ncommander, and took the royal standard of Egypt. In this bloody fray\r\nCervantes received three arquebuse wounds; two in the chesty and one\r\nthat broke and destroyed his left hand. He always, however, regarded\r\nthis loss with pride, and says, in one of his works, that the honour of\r\nhaving been at the battle of Lepanto was cheaply bought by the wounds he\r\nthere received.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the season, the want of provisions, the number of their\r\nwounded, and the express orders of king Philip, prevented the victorious\r\nfleet from following up its victory; and don John returned to Messina on\r\nthe 31st of October. The troops were distributed in various quarters,\r\nand the tercio of Moncada was posted in the south of Sicily. Cervantes\r\nhimself, sick and wounded, remained in the hospital at Messina for at\r\nleast six months. Don John of Austria had shown a lively interest in his\r\nfate on the morning succeeding to the battle, and did not forget him\r\nduring his long confinement. The industrious Viardôt has discovered\r\nmention of various small sums given him by the pay office (pagaduria) of\r\nthe fleet, under the dates of the 15th and 25th of January, and the 9th\r\nand 17th of March, 1572. When at last he recovered, an order was\r\naddressed by the generalissimo, on the 29th of April, to the\r\npay-masters, that the soldier Cervantes should receive the high pay of\r\nfour crowns per month, and be passed into a company of the tercio of\r\nFigueroa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1572.\r\nÆtat.\r\n25.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of the following year was a failure. Of the three allied\r\npowers, the pope was dead, the Venetians grown cold,--the Spaniards\r\nalone remained to prosecute the war. Marco Antonio Colonna set sail on\r\nthe 6th of June for the Archipelago, with a part of the allied fleet;\r\nand, among others, the thirty-six galleys of the marquis of Santa Cruz,\r\non board of which was embarked the regiment of Figueroa, in which\r\nCervantes served.\r\n\r\nDon John sailed on the 9th of August following; but the only enterprise\r\nthey attempted was an unsuccessful assault on the castle of Navarino;\r\nthus the account given of this disastrous campaign in the story of the\r\ncaptive in \"Don Quixote\" was related by Cervantes as an eye-witness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1573.\r\nÆtat.\r\n26.]\r\n\r\nDuring the following year the Venetians signed a peace with Selim; and\r\nthe league being broken up, Philip was obliged to renounce all direct\r\nattack upon the Ottoman power; but having assembled a large force, he\r\ndetermined to employ it on a descent on Algiers or Tunis. Since the time\r\nof Charles V., the Spaniards possessed Goletta, a fortress near Tunis.\r\nHaving, therefore, disembarked his troops, he sent the marquis de Santa\r\nCruz to possess himself of Tunis, which might easily have been done; but\r\nPhilip, jealous of the views of his brother, recalled him in haste from\r\nAfrica. Feeble garrisons were left in Goletta, which the Turks took by\r\nassault the same year.\r\n\r\nCervantes had entered Tunis with the marquis of Santa Cruz, and returned\r\nto Palermo with the fleet. He made one of the force which, under the\r\nduke of Sesa, vainly attempted to succour Goletta: he afterwards\r\nwintered in Sardinia, and was brought back to Naples in the galleys of\r\nMarcel Doria. In the month of June, 1575, he obtained leave from don\r\nJohn of Austria to return to Spain, after an absence of seven years.\r\nViardôt assures us, that in the intervals of military service, or\r\nduring the various expeditions, Cervantes visited Rome, Florence,\r\nVenice, Bologna, Naples, and Palermo. He became accomplished in the\r\nItalian language: the anti-Petrarchists of his time detected the\r\ninfluence of Italian literature, and accused him, as Boscan and\r\nGarcilaso had been accused, of corrupting his native Castilian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1575.\r\nÆtat.\r\n28.]\r\n\r\nCervantes, now twenty-eight years of age, having served in many\r\ncampaigns, maimed and enfeebled, no doubt pined to revisit his native\r\ncountry. He had left it to seek his fortune; he was to return a simple\r\nsoldier; yet the military profession continued dear to him; and when he\r\nspeaks of the many misfortunes a soldier encounters,--his poverty so\r\ngreat that he is poor among the poor; ever expecting his slender pay,\r\nwhich he seldom receives, or is obliged to seize on, at the hazard of\r\nhis life, and to the injury of his conscience; the hardships he\r\nencounters, the dangers he risks, and the small reward he gains,--yet he\r\nlooks on all these circumstances as redounding to his glory, and\r\nrendering him deserving of honour and esteem from all men. We may\r\nbelieve also that Cervantes quitted Italy with well-founded hopes of\r\npreferment in his native country: he had distinguished himself in a\r\nmanner that deserved reward. Don John appreciated his worth, and gave\r\nhim letters to the king his brother, in which he gave due praise for his\r\nconduct at the battle of Lepanto, and begged Philip to confide to him\r\nthe command of one of the regiments which were then being raised in\r\nSpain to serve in Italy or Flanders. The viceroy of Sicily, don Carlos\r\nof Aragon, and the duke of Sesa, also recommended him to the benevolence\r\nof the king and his ministers as a soldier whose valour and worth\r\ndeserved recompence.[58]\r\n\r\nSuch recommendations promised fair. Cervantes embarked on board the\r\nSpanish galley el Sol (the Sun) with his elder brother Rodrigo, also a\r\nsoldier, and with various officers of distinction; but disaster was near\r\nat hand to dash all his hopes, and devote him to years of adversity. On\r\nthe 26th of September the galley was surrounded by an Algerine squadron,\r\nunder the command of the Arnaout Mami, who was captain of the sea. The\r\nTurkish vessels attacked and boarded el Sol. The combat was obstinate,\r\nbut numbers overpowered. The galley was taken and carried into Algiers.\r\nIn the subsequent division of prisoners, Cervantes fell to the share of\r\nthe Arnaout captain himself.\r\n\r\nThe frightful system of cruising for captives, and taking them to\r\nAlgiers to sell them into slavery, which continued for so many hundred\r\nyears, had not long before been carried to greater height than ever by\r\ntwo pirates, who possessed themselves of Algiers and Tunis. The horror\r\nof this warfare had excited the emperor Charles V. to undertake to crush\r\nit. He made two expeditions into Africa, the second of which was\r\nunsuccessful, and the Algerine corsairs pursued their nefarious traffic\r\nwith greater cruelty and success than ever: every particular connected\r\nwith it was frightful and deplorable: the weak and unoffending were its\r\nchief victims: the sea coasts were ravaged for prisoners; and these, if\r\ntoo poor for ransom, became slaves for life, under the most cruel\r\nmasters. The abhorrence excited by these unprovoked attacks caused the\r\nMahometan name to be held in greater odium than ever; and in Spain,\r\nparticularly, this detestation was visited on the Moriscos: the\r\ncruelties and oppression they endured, again excited the Moors of Africa\r\nto reprisals; and innocence and helplessness became on all sides the\r\nvictims of revenge and hatred. Still the piracies carried on by the\r\nAlgerines, and the system to which they reduced their practice of\r\nslavery, raised them to a \"bad height\" in this war of reciprocal\r\ncruelty. None, also, were more pitiless than the renegades; Christians\r\nwho, taken prisoners, bought their freedom by the sacrifice of their\r\nfaith. These men, often the most energetic and prosperous among the\r\ncorsairs, were also the most cruel towards their prisoners; and, among\r\nthem all, none was so cruel as the Arnaout Mami.\r\n\r\nFortunately, interesting details of Cervantes's captivity have come down\r\nto us from undoubted and impartial sources, as well as from his own\r\naccounts; and these place him in the brightest light as a man of\r\nsagacity, resolution, and honour. That these details are not fuller we\r\nmust lament; but, such as they are, they display so much gallantry and\r\nmagnanimity on Cervantes's part, that they must be read with the\r\ngreatest pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn his tale of the \"Captive,\" Cervantes gives an account of the mode in\r\nwhich captives were treated at Algiers. He says, \"There is a prison or\r\nhouse, which the Turks call a bagnio, in which the Christian captives\r\nare confined,--those belonging to the king as well as to various\r\nindividuals; and also those of the Almacen, or slaves of the council,\r\nwho labour for the town at the public works, or are employed in other\r\noffices; who, as they belong to the city, and not to any particular\r\nmaster, have no one with whom to treat concerning their ransom, and are\r\nworse off than the others. As I have said; various individuals place\r\ntheir slaves in this bagnio, and principally those whom they expect to\r\nbe ransomed, because they are kept there more securely. The captives of\r\nthe king, who expect to be ransomed, are not sent out to work with the\r\nrest; and they wear a chain, more as a sign that they are to obtain\r\ntheir freedom than from any other cause: and here many cavaliers and men\r\nof birth live, thus marked, and kept for redemption; and although hunger\r\nand nakedness might well weary them, nothing brought so much pain as\r\nwitnessing the unspeakable and frightful cruelties practised towards the\r\nChristians. Each day, the dey, who was a Venetian renegade, hanged or\r\nimpaled some among them; and this from such trifling causes, and often\r\nfrom none at all, that the Turks themselves were aware that he inflicted\r\nthese cruelties in wantonness, and because it was his natural\r\ndisposition to be the enemy of the human race. One man only did he treat\r\nwell, a soldier, by name Saavedra, who, having achieved things that will\r\nremain for many years in the memory of that people, and all for the sake\r\nof gaining his liberty, yet never received a blow nor an ill word;\r\nthough it was often thought that for the slightest of the things he did\r\nhe would be impaled, and he himself often expected it; and, if it were\r\nnot that I have no time nor place, I would recount what this soldier\r\ndid, which would indeed excite your admiration and wonder.\"[59]\r\n\r\nIn these terms does Cervantes speak of himself in his captivity; and so\r\noften are writers accused of boasting that this might have been brought\r\nforward as a proof of his vanity merely, but that we have another\r\ntestimony in a book named \"Topography and general History of Algiers, by\r\nFather Diego de Haedo[60],\" a contemporary; and his account, though not\r\nfull enough to satisfy our curiosity, yet proves that Cervantes spoke of\r\nhis deeds with no exaggeration; and that, to attain his liberty, he\r\nincurred every risk, and endured a thousand hardships and perils with\r\ndauntless courage. As Cervantes often alludes to himself, it is strange\r\nthat he did not write an account of his years of captivity; but the\r\ntruth is, that, though we may be led to mention ourselves, it is ever a\r\ntedious task to write at length on the subject: recollections come by\r\ncrowds; hopes baffled, our dearest memories discovered to have a taint,\r\nour lives wasted and fallen into contempt even in our own eyes: so that\r\nwe readily turn from dispiriting realities to such creatures of the\r\nimagination as we can fashion according to our liking. But to return.\r\n\r\nThe account above given of the situation of the captives refers to those\r\nbest off. The rest were either employed as galley slaves, or in other\r\nhard labours. Among the latter Cervantes was probably numbered, as Haedo\r\nmentions that his captivity was one of peculiar hardship. Driven to\r\nresistance by his sufferings, Cervantes several times endeavoured to\r\nobtain his liberty.\r\n[Sidenote: 1576.\r\nÆtat.\r\n29.]\r\nHis first attempt was made in conjunction with several others, under the\r\ndesign of reaching Oran (a town of Africa, then in possession of Spain,)\r\nby land. He and his comrades even contrived to get out of the town of\r\nAlgiers; but the Moorish guide whom they had engaged deserted them, and\r\nthey were obliged to return and deliver themselves up to their masters.\r\n\r\nSome of his companions, and among them ensign Gabrièl de Castañeda,\r\nwere ransomed in the middle of the year 1576. Castañeda took letters\r\nfrom the captive brothers to their father, Rodrigo Cervantes, describing\r\ntheir miserable situation. He instantly sold or mortgaged his little\r\nproperty, and, indeed, every thing he possessed, even to the dowry of\r\nhis daughters, who were not yet married; the whole family being thus\r\nreduced to penury.\r\n[Sidenote: 1577.\r\nÆtat.\r\n30.]\r\nThe entire sum, unhappily, did not suffice for the redemption of both\r\nbrothers. Miguel accordingly gave up his share to secure the freedom of\r\nRodrigo, who was set free in August, 1577. He promised at parting to get\r\nan armed vessel equipped at Valencia or the Balearic isles, which,\r\ntouching at a place agreed on, near Algiers, would facilitate the escape\r\nof his brother and other captives; and he carried with him to this\r\neffect several letters from men of high birth, now fallen into the\r\nmiserable condition of slaves, to various persons in power in Spain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cervantes was arranging another plan for escape, nay, he was\r\nfar advanced in its execution at the time of his brother's departure.\r\nThe alcayd Hassan, a Greek renegade, possessed a garden three miles from\r\nAlgiers, close to the sea: in this garden Juan, a slave from Navarre,\r\nhad contrived to dig a cavern; and here, under the conduct of Cervantes,\r\na number of runaway captives hid themselves till an opportunity should\r\noffer for final evasion. Some of them had taken up their abode in the\r\ncave since the month of February, 1577: it was dark and damp, but it\r\nproved a safe asylum. The numbers increased till they amounted to\r\nfifteen. They had only two confidants, both Christians. Juan, the\r\ngardener of the alcayd Hassan, who worked near the mouth of the cave,\r\nand kept watch for them; and another, a native of Villa de Melilla, a\r\nsmall town of Barbary, subject to the king of Spain. He had become a\r\nrenegade when a boy, and then again turned Christian, and was now\r\ncaptured for the second time. This man, who was commonly surnamed el\r\nDorador, or the Gilder, had it particularly in charge to supply the\r\nfugitives with food and necessaries, buying them with the money given\r\nhim, and bringing them secretly to the cavern.\r\n\r\nThe runaways had now been hidden for seven months: the confinement was\r\nirksome and unhealthy, and they never breathed the free air of heaven\r\nexcept in the dead of night, when they stole out for a short time into\r\nthe garden. They often incurred the greatest dangers,--as Haedo says,\r\n\"what these men suffered in the cavern, and what they said and did,\r\nwould deserve a particular account.\" Several fell sick, and all endured\r\nincredible hardship; while through all they were supported and\r\nencouraged by the firmness and dauntless courage of Cervantes. In the\r\nmonth of September, an opportunity offered itself, as they hoped, for\r\neffecting their ultimate escape. A Mallorcan captive, of the name of\r\nMana, accustomed to the sea, and well acquainted with the coast of\r\nBarbary, was ransomed; and the captives of the cave agreed with him that\r\nhe should hire a vessel, either in Mallorca or Spain, and bring it to\r\nthe neighbourhood of the garden by night, where they could unperceived\r\nembark, and sail for their native country. When this was arranged,\r\nCervantes, who had hitherto thought that he served his friends best by\r\nremaining in Algiers, made his escape and repaired to the cavern, and\r\nremained there.\r\n\r\nViana performed his part with celerity and success. He hired a\r\nbrigantine at Mallorca, and arrived with it at Algiers on the 28th of\r\nSeptember. As had been concerted, he made, in the middle of the night,\r\nfor the part of the coast where the garden and the cavern were situated.\r\nMost unfortunately, however, at the moment when the prow of the\r\nbrigantine bore down on shore, several Moors passed by, and, perceiving\r\nthe vessel, and that the crew were Christians, gave the alarm, crying\r\nout \"Christians! Christians! a vessel! a vessel!\" When those on board\r\nheard this they were obliged to put out to sea again, and to give up\r\ntheir attempt for that time.\r\n\r\nThe captives in the cave were, however, undiscovered; and they still put\r\ntheir trust in God, and believed that Viana as a man of honour, would\r\nnot fail them; and though suffering through sickness, confinement, and\r\ndisappointment, they still supported themselves with the hope of\r\nsucceeding at last in their attempt. Unfortunately the Dorador turned\r\ntraitor. The ill success of Viana's attempt perhaps made him imagine\r\nthat all would be discovered and he be implicated in the dangers of the\r\nenterprise, while, on the other hand, he hoped to gain large rewards\r\nfrom the masters of the runaway slaves by giving them up. Two days only\r\nafter Viana left the coast, he sought an audience with the dey, declared\r\nhis wish to turn Mahometan, and asked his permission; while, as a proof\r\nof his sincerity, he offered to betray into his hands fifteen Christian\r\ncaptives, who lay concealed in a cavern, expecting a vessel from\r\nMallorca for their deliverance.\r\n\r\nThe dey was delighted with this account. As a tyrant, he resolved,\r\nagainst all custom and right, to appropriate the runaways to himself; so\r\nsending immediately for Bashi, the gaoler of the bagnio, he commanded\r\nhim to take a guard, and, guided by the renegade, to seize on the\r\nChristians hidden in the cave. Bashi did as he was ordered; and,\r\naccompanied by eight mounted Turks and twenty-four on foot, armed, for\r\nthe most part, with muskets and sabres, he, guided by the traitor,\r\nrepaired to the garden. The first man they seized on was the gardener;\r\nthey then made for the cave, and captured all the Christians.\r\n\r\nThe traitor Dorador had mentioned Cervantes, whom Haedo names \"a\r\ndistinguished hidalgo of Alcalá de Hernares,\" as the originator and the\r\nheart and soul of the whole enterprise. He, therefore, was singled out\r\nto be more heavily ironed than the rest; and when the dey, seizing on\r\nthe whole number as his own, ordered them to be carried to the bagnio,\r\nhe detained Cervantes in the palace, and, by entreaties and terrible\r\nmenaces, tried to induce him to declare the true author of their\r\nattempt. His motive in this was to implicate, if possible, a friar of\r\nthe order of mercy, established at Algiers as redeemer of slaves for the\r\nkingdom of Aragon, on whom he desired to lay hands for the purpose of\r\nextorting money.\r\n\r\nBut all his endeavours were vain; and though his merciless disposition\r\ngave Cervantes every cause to apprehend a cruel death, he, with\r\nundaunted firmness, continued to reiterate that the whole enterprise\r\noriginated in, and was carried on by, himself, heroically incurring the\r\nwhole blame, and running the risk of the heaviest punishment. Finding\r\nall his endeavours fail, the dey sent him also to the prison of the\r\nbagnio.\r\n\r\nAs soon as these circumstances became known, the former masters of the\r\ncaptives claimed each his slave: the dey resisted where he could; but he\r\nwas obliged to give up three or four, and among them Cervantes, who was\r\nrestored to the Arnaout Mami, who had originally captured him. The\r\nalcayd Hassan hastened also to the dey to obtain leave to punish the\r\ngardener, who was hung with his head downwards, and left to die.\r\nCervantes, meanwhile, returning to his old state of slavery, was by no\r\nmeans disposed to submit to it. Ardent and resolute, his schemes for\r\nprocuring his liberation were daring in the extreme. Many times he\r\nreiterated his attempts, and ran risk of being impaled or otherwise put\r\nto death; and how he came to be spared cannot be guessed, except that\r\nthe gallantry of his spirit excited the respect of his masters, and,\r\nperhaps, associating the ideas of bravery and resolution with noble\r\nbirth, it was supposed that in the end he would be ransomed at a high\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1578.\r\nÆtat.\r\n31.]\r\n\r\nSoon after Hassan Aga himself purchased him from Mami, either hoping to\r\ngain through his ransom, or to keep a better watch over his restless\r\nattempts. At one time he sent letters through a Moor to don Martin de\r\nCordova, governor of Oran; but this emissary was taken, and brought with\r\nhis despatches before the dey. The unfortunate man was condemned to be\r\nimpaled, and Cervantes was sentenced to the bastinado; but, from some\r\nundiscovered influence, his punishment on this occasion, as well as\r\nevery other, was remitted.[61]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1579.\r\nÆtat.\r\n32.]\r\n\r\nThis ill success did not daunt his courage. In September, 1579, he\r\nformed acquaintance with a Spanish renegade, the licentiate Giron, born\r\nat Granada, who had taken the name of Abd-al-Rhamen. This renegade was\r\neager to return to his native country, and reassume the Christian faith.\r\nWith him Cervantes concerted a new plan of escape: they had recourse to\r\ntwo Valencian merchants, established at Algiers,--Onofrio Exarch; and\r\nBathazar de Torres: they assisted in the plot; and the former\r\ncontributed 1500 doubloons for the price of an armed frigate with twelve\r\nbanks of oars, which Abd-al-Rhamen bought under the pretence of going on\r\na cruise as corsair. The vessel was ready, and the captives were on the\r\nalert to get on board, when they were betrayed. Doctor Juan Blanco de\r\nPaz, a Dominican monk, for the sake of a reward, denounced the scheme to\r\nthe dey.\r\n\r\nHassan Aga at first dissimulated: his desire was, as in the former\r\ninstance, though then frustrated, to confiscate the slaves to the state,\r\nby which means he should become possessed of them; nevertheless it\r\nbecame known that they were betrayed; and Onofrio, fearful that if\r\nCervantes were taken, he would be tortured into making confessions\r\ninjurious to him; offered to buy him at any price and send him to Spain.\r\nCervantes refused to avoid the common peril. He had escaped from the\r\nbagnio, and was hidden at the house of one of his old military comrades,\r\nthe ensign Diego Castillano. The dey made a public proclamation of him,\r\nthreatening with death any one who afforded him refuge. Cervantes, on\r\nthis, delivered himself up, having first secured the intercession of a\r\nMurcian renegade, Morato Raez Matrapillo, who was a favourite with\r\nHassan Aga. The dey demanded the names of his accomplices of Cervantes,\r\nand threatened him with immediate execution if he refused. Cervantes was\r\nnot to be moved; he named himself and four Spanish gentlemen already at\r\nliberty, but fear of death extracted no other word. Despite his cruelty\r\nthere must have been a touch of better things about Hassan Aga. He was\r\nmoved by the constancy and fearlessness of his captive: he spared his\r\nlife, but imprisoned him in a dungeon, where he was kept strictly\r\nguarded and chained. The ensign Luis Pedrosa, an ocular witness of his\r\ncountryman's conduct, exclaims on this, that his noble conduct deserved\r\n\"renown, honour, and a crown among Christians.\"\r\n\r\nThe dey had now become thoroughly frightened. Cervantes's late plots\r\nwere not limited merely to the attainment of freedom; he aimed at\r\nraising the whole captive population in revolt, and so gaining\r\npossession of Algiers for the crown of Spain. Hassan Aga, in his fear,\r\nwas heard to exclaim, that \"he only held his city, fleet; and slaves\r\nsecure, while he kept that maimed Christian in safe custody.\"\r\n\r\nThe courage and heroism of Cervantes excited the respect of the friars\r\nof the Order of Mercy, who resided at Algiers for the purpose of\r\ntreating for the ransom of the Christian captives. This order had been\r\nestablished as far back as the twelfth century by pope Innocent III. It\r\nwas originally founded by two French hermits, who, dedicated to a holy\r\nlife in solitude, believed themselves called upon by God to take more\r\nactive service in the cause of religion. They repaired to Rome, and were\r\nwell received by pope Innocent, who saw the benefits that might arise to\r\nChristianity from the pious labours of these men. He instituted an\r\norder, therefore, whose members were to dedicate themselves to the\r\nliberating of Christian slaves out of the hands of the infidels. It was\r\ncalled the order of the most Holy Trinity, for the Redemption of\r\nCaptives. At first its labours were probably most in use to ransom\r\ncrusaders, taken prisoners in the wars of Palestine. Africa afterwards\r\nbecame the scene of their greatest labours and dangers: various members\r\nof the order were regularly appointed, and resided in Algiers, for the\r\npurpose of carrying on treaties for the ransom of captives in\r\nparticular. Each kingdom of Spain had its peculiar holy officer, a sort\r\nof spiritual consul, who transacted all the affairs of redemption and\r\nliberation for the unfortunate slaves.\r\n\r\nCervantes's case was peculiar: distinguished among his fellow slaves,\r\nthe dey paid him the inconvenient compliment of rating his ransom\r\nhighly, and set the price of 1000 golden crowns on him; application was\r\nmade in Spain, and it was endeavoured to collect his ransom. His father\r\nwas now dead, and his mother, donna Leonora, a widow, could only\r\ncontribute 250 ducats, his sister 50 more. This sum was placed in the\r\nhands of the friars Juan Gil and Antonio de la Vella, who arrived in\r\nAlgiers in May, 1580, for the purpose of treating for the redemption of\r\nvarious captives. For a long time they were unable to bring the dey into\r\nany terms with regard to Cervantes: the sum of 1000 golden ducats was\r\nexorbitant, yet during several months he refused to take less. At last\r\nhe received an order from the sultan, which appointed him a successor,\r\nand enforced his return to Constantinople. At first he threatened to\r\ntake Cervantes, whom he kept on board his galley, with him; and the\r\nfriars raised their offers to prevent this disaster: at last he agreed\r\nto receive 500 golden crowns as his ransom: on the 19th of September,\r\n1580, the bargain was completed. Hassan sailed for Constantinople, and\r\nCervantes was set on shore at Algiers, free to return to Spain.[62]\r\n\r\nThe first use, however, that he made of his liberty was to refute, in\r\nthe most determined manner, certain calumnies of which he was the\r\nobject. The traitor, Juan Blanco de Paz, who falsely pretended to belong\r\nto the inquisition, cast on him the accusation of betraying the\r\nconspiracy, and of causing the exile of the renegade Giron. The moment\r\nthat Cervantes was free he entreated father Juan Gil to examine the\r\nwhole affair. In consequence, the apostolic notary, Pedro de Ribera,\r\ndrew out twenty-five questions, and received the depositions of eleven\r\nSpanish gentlemen, the most distinguished among the captives, in answer.\r\nThese examinations, in which all the events of Cervantes's captivity are\r\nminutely recounted, give besides the most interesting details concerning\r\nhis understanding, his character, the purity of his life, and the\r\ndevoted sacrifices he made to his companions in misfortune, which gained\r\nfor him so many friends.\r\n\r\nViardôt, who has seen this document, not mentioned by any other author,\r\ncites among the depositions that of don Diego de Benavides. Having made\r\ninquiries, he says, on his arrival at Algiers concerning the principal\r\nChristian captives, Cervantes was mentioned to him as honourable, noble,\r\nvirtuous, of excellent character, and beloved by all the other\r\ngentlemen. Benavides cultivated his friendship, and he was treated so\r\nkindly, that he says, \"he found both a father and a mother in him.\" The\r\ncarmelite monk, Feliciano Enriquez, declared, that having discovered the\r\nfalsehood of an accusation made against Cervantes, he, in common with\r\nall the other captives, became his friend; his noble, Christian,\r\nupright, and virtuous conduct raising a sort of emulation among them.\r\nFinally, the ensign Luis de Pedrosa declares, \"that of all the gentlemen\r\nresident at Algiers, he knew not one who did so much good to their\r\nfellow captives as Cervantes, or who showed a more rigid observance of\r\nthe point of honour; and that in addition, all that he did was adorned\r\nwith a peculiar grace, through his understanding, prudence, and\r\nforethought, in which few people could equal him.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the natural elevation of Cervantes over his fellow-creatures,\r\nwhen, all being placed on an equality, the qualities of the soul alone\r\nproduced a difference of rank. It inspires infinite contempt for the\r\narbitrary distinctions of society when we find this prince and leader\r\namong his fellows was, when restored to his native country, depressed by\r\npoverty and obscured by want; and when we find no spirit of repining\r\ndisplayed during his after life, though he had dignity of soul to assert\r\nhis worth, we are impelled to give Cervantes as high a place for moral\r\nexcellence as his genius has secured for him in the world of intellect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:1581.\r\nÆtat.\r\n34.]\r\n\r\nCervantes landed in Spain early the following year. He so often\r\nexpresses the excessive joy imparted by a restoration to freedom, that\r\nwe may believe that his heart beat high with exultation when he set his\r\nfoot on the shores of his native country. \"On earth,\" he says, \"there is\r\nno good like regaining lost liberty.\" Yet he arrived poor, and if not\r\nfriendless yet his friends were poor also. His mother's purse had been\r\ndrained to contribute to his ransom. As a literary man he was not known,\r\nnor, indeed, had he written any thing since he left Spain eleven years\r\nbefore. He evidently did not at first look upon literature as a resource\r\nby which to live. He was still a soldier in heart, and such he became\r\nagain by profession, though it would seem that his long captivity erased\r\nthe recollection of, and deprived him of all reward for, his past\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nAt this time Portugal had been recently conquered by the duke of Alva.\r\nIt was now tranquil, but still occupied by Spanish troops. This army was\r\nin preparation to attack the Azores, which still held out. Rodrigo de\r\nCervantes, after his ransom, had re-entered the service. His brother\r\nfound himself obliged to follow his example. That he had no powerful\r\nfriend is proved by the circumstance that he again volunteered. Maimed\r\nof a hand, in a manner which proved his gallantry, while Algiers still\r\nrang with the fame of his intrepidity and daring, poverty in his native\r\ncountry hung like a heavy cloud over him. We must, however, at this\r\nperiod consider that he was not known as the author of Don Quixote, and\r\na man of genius; he had shown himself only as a gallant soldier of\r\nfortune. Such he continued to be. He served in three campaigns. In the\r\nsummer of 1581 he embarked in the squadron of don Pedro Valdes, who had\r\norders to make an attempt on the Azores, and to protect the commerce of\r\nthe Indies.\r\n[Sidenote:1582.\r\nÆtat.\r\n35.]\r\nThe following year he served under the orders of the marquis de Santa\r\nCruz, and was in the naval battle which that admiral gained on the 25th\r\nof July, within sight of the island of Terceira, over the French fleet,\r\nwhich had taken part with the Portuguese insurgents. It is asserted,\r\nthat beyond a question Cervantes served in the regiment of the\r\ncamp-major-general, don Lope de Figueroa. This corps was composed of\r\nveterans, and was embarked on board the galleon San Mateo, which took a\r\ndistinguished part in the victory.\r\n[Sidenote:1583.\r\nÆtat.\r\n36.]\r\nIn the campaign of 1583 he and his brother were at the taking of\r\nTerceira, which was carried by assault. Rodrigo distinguished himself\r\ngreatly on this occasion, and was one of the first to spring on shore;\r\nfor which, on the return of the fleet, he was promoted to the rank of\r\nensign.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of Spanish manners that, although only serving in\r\nthe ranks, Cervantes mingled in the society of the nobles of Portugal.\r\nHe was an hidalgo and, as such, freely admitted to the circles of the\r\nwell born, despite his poverty. He was engaged in a love affair at\r\nLisbon: the name of the lady is not known: it seems likely, from\r\nattendant circumstances, that she was not possessed of either rank or\r\nfortune. She bore him a daughter, whom he named donna Isabel de\r\nSaavedra, and brought up; and she remained with him even after his\r\nmarriage till she took vows in a convent in Madrid, but a short time\r\nbefore her father's death. He never had another child.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:1584.\r\nÆtat.\r\n37.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1584 Cervantes appeared as an author. He seems to have\r\nwritten rather under the excitement of his natural genius, which\r\nimpelled him to composition, than under the idea of earning a livelihood\r\nby his pen. The most popular works then in Spain were the \"Diana\" of\r\nMontemayor, and the continuation of the same work by Gil Polo. This last\r\nwas a particular favourite of Cervantes. In the scrutiny made by the\r\ncurate of Don Quixote's library, he thus speaks of these books:--\"I am\r\nof opinion that we do not burn the 'Diana' of Montemayor; let us only\r\nerase from it all the part that concerns the wise Felicia and the\r\nenchanted water, and almost all the poetry written in _versos mayores_,\r\nand let the prose remain, and the honour it enjoys of being the first of\r\nthese species of books. As to the continuation by Gil Polo, take care of\r\nit as if Apollo himself were the author. Of his own 'Galatea,' he makes\r\nthe curate say, \"Cervantes has for many years been my intimate friend,\r\nand I know he has more experience in disasters than good fortune. There\r\nis the merit of invention in his book: he proposes something but\r\nconcludes nothing; and we must wait for the second part, which he\r\npromises, when I hope he will merit the entire pardon which is as yet\r\ndenied.\"\r\n\r\nWhen pastorals were the fashion, there was something very attractive in\r\nthe composition of them to a poetic mind. The author, if he were in\r\nlove, could so easily turn himself into a shepherd, musing on his\r\npassion on the banks of rivulets, and all the lets and hindrances to his\r\nhappiness he could transform into pastoral incidents. Montemayor and Gil\r\nPolo had acknowledgedly done this before, and it was but in good costume\r\nto imitate their example. We are told that, at the time of writing this\r\nwork, Cervantes was already deeply in love with the lady whom he\r\nafterwards married. She figured as the lovely shepherdess Galatea. Lope\r\nde Vega asserts that Cervantes introduced himself as Elisio, the hero of\r\nhis work. Viardôt says, \"It cannot be doubted but that the other\r\nshepherds introduced in the romance as Tirsis, Damon, Meliso, Siralvo,\r\nLauso, Larsileo, Artidoro, are intended for Francisco de Figueroa, Pedro\r\nLainez, don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Luis Galvez de Montalvo, Luis\r\nBarahona de Soto, don Alonzo de Ercilla, Andres Rey de Artieda. These\r\nnames all figure in the Spanish Parnassus, and it may be that they are\r\nintroduced, but we have no proof. That the allusions made both to\r\nhimself and his friends are very vague, is proved by the fact that Los\r\nRios declares that Damon was the name of the shepherd figuring\r\nCervantes, and Amarilis that of his lady-love. Of the pastoral itself we\r\nshall mention more when we come to speak of all Cervantes's works;\r\nsuffice it now to say, that the purity of its style, and the ease of\r\ninvention, must at once have raised Cervantes in the eyes of his friends\r\nto the rank of a writer of merit.\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly gained him favour in the eyes of the lady. Soon after the\r\npublication of the \"Galatea\" she consented to become his wife. On the\r\n8th December, 1584, Cervantes accordingly married, at Esquivias, donna\r\nCatilina de Palacios y Salazar. Her family, though impoverished, was one\r\nof the most noble of that town. She had been brought up in the house of\r\nher uncle, don Francisco de Salazar, who left her a legacy in his will,\r\nor which reason she assumed his name in conjunction with her own; for it\r\nwas the custom in those days for persons to call themselves after one to\r\nwhom they owed the obligation of education and subsistence. The father\r\nof donna Catalina was dead, and the widow promised, when her daughter\r\nwas affianced, to give her a moderate dower. This was done two years\r\nafterwards; the contract of marriage bearing date of August 9th, 1586.\r\nThis portion we find to consist of a few vineyards, a garden, an\r\norchard, several beehives, a hencoop, and some household furniture,\r\namounting in value to 182,000 maravedis, or about 5360 reals, being, in\r\nEnglish money, about 60_l_. This property was settled on donna Catalina,\r\nthe management of it only remaining with her husband, who also settled\r\non her 100 ducats, which are stated as the tenth of his property.\r\n\r\nOn his marriage, Cervantes took up his abode at Esquivias, probably from\r\nsome motive of economy. Still feeling within him the innate assurance of\r\ngenius, and the laudable desire of distinction which that feeling\r\nengenders, he dwelt on the idea of becoming an author. Esquivias is so\r\nnear Madrid that he could pay frequent visits to the capital; and he\r\ncultivated the acquaintance of the authors of that day, and in\r\nparticular of Vicente Espinel, one of the most charming romance writers\r\nof Spain. A noble of the court had instituted a sort of literary academy\r\nat his house, and it is conjectured that Cervantes was chosen a member.\r\n\r\nAt this time he wrote for the theatre. There was ever a lurking love for\r\nthe drama in Spain. In his youth Cervantes had frequented the\r\nrepresentations of Lope de Rueda, previously mentioned in this work, and\r\nhe felt impelled to contribute to the drama. He saw the defects of the\r\nplays in vogue, which were rather dialogues than dramatic compositions.\r\nHe saw the miserable state of the stage and scenery. He endeavoured to\r\nrectify these deficiencies, and in some measure succeeded. \"I must\r\ntrespass on my modesty,\" he says, in one of his prefaces, \"to relate the\r\nperfection to which these things were brought when 'The Captives of\r\nAlgiers,' 'Numantia,' and 'The Naval Battle,' dramas written by me, were\r\nrepresented at the theatre of Madrid. I then ventured to reduce the five\r\nacts, into which plays were before divided, into three. I was the first\r\nwho personified imaginary phantoms and the secret thoughts of the soul,\r\nbringing allegorical personages on the stage, with the universal\r\napplause of the audience. I wrote at that time some twenty or thirty\r\nplays, which were all performed without the public throwing pumpkins, or\r\noranges, or any of those things which spectators are apt to cast at the\r\nheads of bad actors: my plays were acted without hissing, confusion, or\r\nclamour.\"\r\n\r\nOf the plays which Cervantes mentions, two only exist--\"Numantia\" and\r\n\"Life in Algiers.\" They are very inartificial in their plots, and\r\ntotally unlike the busy pieces of intrigue soon after introduced; but\r\nthe first, in particular, has great merit, as will be mentioned\r\nhereafter. Still, his plays did not bring such profit as to render him\r\nindependent. He was now forty: he had run through a variety of\r\nadventures, and remained unrewarded for his services, and unprotected by\r\na patron. He was married; and, though he had no children by his wife, he\r\nmaintained in his house his two sisters and his natural daughter:\r\ndespite his vineyard, his orchard, and his hencoop,--despite also his\r\ntheatrical successes--he felt himself straitened in circumstances.\r\n[Sidenote:1588.\r\nÆtat.\r\n41.]\r\nAt this time, Antonio de Guevara, councillor of finance, was named\r\npurveyor to the Indian squadrons and fleets at Seville, with the right\r\nof naming as his assistants four commissaries. He was now employed in\r\nfitting out the Invincible Armada. He offered the situation of\r\ncommissary to Cervantes, who accepted it, and set out for Seville with\r\nhis wife and daughter, and two sisters.[63]\r\n\r\nCervantes lived for many years at Seville fulfilling duties of his\r\nemployment.\r\n[Sidenote:1591.\r\nÆtat.\r\n44.]\r\nHe served at first for ten years under Guevara, and then for two more\r\nunder his successor, Pedro de Isunza.\r\n[Sidenote:1593.\r\nÆtat.\r\n45.]\r\nThat he was not contented with the situation, and that it was an\r\ninsignificant one, is proved by his having solicited the king to give\r\nhim the place of paymaster in New Granada, or of corregidor in the small\r\ntown of Gcetemala. His request bears the date of May, 1590. It was\r\nrefused fortunately; yet his funds and his hopes, also, must have been\r\nlow to make him turn his eyes towards the Indies; for, speaking of such\r\na design in one of his tales, he says of a certain hidalgo that,\r\n\"finding himself at Seville without money or friends, he had reccurse to\r\nthe remedy to which so many ruined men in that city run, which is going\r\nto the Indies--the refuge and shelter of all Spaniards of desperate\r\nfortunes, the common deceiver of many, the individual remedy of few.\" At\r\nlength the purveyor-ship being suppressed, his office was also\r\nabolished, and he became agent to various municipalities, corporations,\r\nand wealthy individuals: among the rest, he managed the affairs, and\r\nbecame the friend, of don Hernando de Toledo, a noble of Cigales.\r\n\r\nWe have little trace of how he exercised his pen during this interval.\r\nThe house of the celebrated painter Francisco Pacheco, master and\r\nfather-in-law of Velasquez, was then frequented by all the men of\r\neducation in Seville: the painter was also a poet, and Rodrigo Caro\r\nmentions that his house was an academy resorted to by all the literati\r\nof the town. Cervantes was numbered among them; and his portrait is\r\nfound among the pictures of more than a hundred distinguished persons,\r\npainted and brought together by this artist. The poet Jauregui, who also\r\ncultivated painting, painted his portrait, and was numbered among his\r\nfriends. Here Cervantes became the friend of Herrera, who spent his life\r\nin Seville, secluded from the busy world, but venerated and admired by\r\nhis friends. Cervantes, in after days, wrote a sonnet to his memory, and\r\nmentions him with fond praise in his \"Voyage to Parnassus.\" Viardôt\r\nassures us, that it was during his residence at Seville that Cervantes\r\nwrote most of his tales. This appears probable. Certainly he did not\r\nlose the habit of composition. Much of the material of these stories was\r\nfurnished him by incidents that actually occurred in Seville; and when\r\nwe see the mastery of invention and language he had acquired when he\r\nwrote \"Don Quixote,\" we may believe that these tales occupied his pen\r\nwhen apparently, in a literary sense, idle.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, at Seville, and during his distasteful employments there,\r\nhe acquired that bitter view of human affairs displayed in \"Don\r\nQuixote.\" Yet it is wrong to call it bitter. Even when his hopes were\r\ncrushed and blighted, a noble enthusiasm survived disappointment and\r\nill-treatment; and, though he looks sadly, and with somewhat of\r\ncausticity on human life, still no one can mistake the generous and\r\nlofty aspirations of his injured spirit throughout. We have two sonnets\r\nof his, written at Seville, which justify the idea, however, that there\r\nwas something in this city (as is usually the case with provincial\r\ntowns), that peculiarly excited his spirit of sarcasm. The first of\r\nthese sonnets was written in ridicule of some recruits gathered together\r\nby a captain Bercerra to join the forces sent under the duke of Medina,\r\nto repel the disembarcation of the earl of Essex, who hovered near Cadiz\r\nwith his fleet.\r\n\r\nThe second is more known. On the death of Philip II. in 1598, a\r\nmagnificent catafalque was erected in the cathedral of Seville, \"the\r\nmost wonderful funereal monument,\" says a narrator of the ceremony,\r\n\"which human eyes ever had the happiness of seeing.\" All Seville was in\r\necstasy, the catafalque was superb; it did honour to Spain; and they\r\nbuilt the catafalque: could provincial town have better cause to strut\r\nand boast?[64] The Andalusians, also, are addicted to gasconading, and\r\nCervantes could not resist the temptation of ridiculing both the\r\nmonument and its vaunting erectors. In his \"Voyage to Parnassus,\"\r\nCervantes calls this sonnet \"the chief honour of his writings.\" After\r\nsuch an announcement it is hold to attempt a translation. This sort of\r\nwitty burlesque can never be transfused into another language, for its\r\npoint consists rather in association of ideas, which only those on the\r\nspot can enter into, than, in witty allusions common to all the world.\r\nThe conclusion of the epigram is to this day the delight of the\r\nSpaniards, who all know it by heart. The species of sonnet is named an\r\n_Estrumbote_, having three verses more than the proper fourteen. The\r\nfollowing translation being tolerably literal, may serve to satisfy the\r\ncuriosity of the English reader, though it cannot do justice to the\r\ncomposition itself. For the sake of the Spanish one, the original is\r\ninserted underneath.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MONUMENT OF THE KING AT SEVILLE.\r\n\r\n\"I vow to God, I quake with my surprise!\r\nCould I describe it, I would give a crown--\r\nAnd who, that gazes on it in the town,\r\nBut stands aghast to see its woodrous size:\r\nEach part a million cost, I should devise;\r\nWhat pity't is, ere centuries have flown,\r\nOld Time will mercilessly cast it down!\r\nThou rival'st Rome, O Seville, in my eves!\r\nI bet, the soul of him who's dead and blest,\r\nTo dwell within this sumptuous monument,\r\nHas left the seats of sempiternal rest!\"\r\nA fellow tall, on deeds of valour bent,\r\nMy exclamation heard, \"Bravo!\" he cried,\r\n\"Sir Soldier, what you say is true, I vow,\r\nAnd he who says the contrary has lied!\"\r\nWith that, he pulls his hat upon his brow,\r\nUpon his sword's hilt he his hand does lay,\r\nAnd frowns--and--nothing does, but walks away.[65]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe financial occupations of Cervantes at Seville were full of various\r\nannoyances; and it seems to have been his destiny at all times, to find\r\nhis life beset with various forms of adversity. He was accused of\r\nmalversation in the employment of monies entrusted to him. His poverty\r\nwas his best defence, but it required other circumstances to prove his\r\ninnocence, and his honest heart and lofty soul must have been tortured\r\nby all the detail of accusation and defence. Viardôt has, by examining\r\nthe archives of Valladolid, Seville, and Madrid, found traces of various\r\ncircumstances, which he details. In themselves some of them scarcely\r\ndeserve record, except as happening to Cervantes, and showing how like\r\nthe equally unfortunate but more imprudent Hums, he was occupied by\r\ntransactions antipathetic to his tastes and vocation. The first\r\ncircumstance recorded by Viardôt is indeed a mere mercantile casualty,\r\nfull of annoyance at the time, but whose effects even to the sufferer,\r\nvanishes like footsteps in the sand, when the next tide flows.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1594, while he was settling at Seville the accounts\r\nof his commissariat, and calling in with much difficulty several sums in\r\narrear, he forwarded the receipts to the _contaduria mayor_ of Madrid,\r\nin bills of exchange drawn upon Seville. One of these sums, arising from\r\nthe taxation of the district of Velez-Malaga, amounting to 7400 rials,\r\n(little more than 70_l_.) was intrusted by him in specie to a merchant\r\nof Seville named Simon Freire de Lima, who undertook to pay it into the\r\ntreasury at Madrid. It was not paid, and Cervantes was forced to make a\r\njourney to the capital to demand from Friere the sum in question; but\r\nthis man meanwhile became bankrupt, and had tied from Spain. Cervantes\r\nhastened back to Seville, and found the property of his debtor seized on\r\nby other creditors. He addressed a request to the king, and a decree was\r\npublished on the 7th of August 1595; ordering doctor Bernardo de\r\nOlmedilla; judge of _los Grados_ at Seville; to take by privilege on the\r\ngoods of Friere; the sum intrusted to him by Cervantes. This was done,\r\nand the money was sent by the judge to the general treasurer, don Pedro\r\nMesia de Tobar; in a bill of exchange drawn on the 22d of November 1596.\r\n\r\nThe next anecdote is of more interest; and displays the style in which\r\njustice was carried on in Spain. Cervantes wrote from his heart and from\r\nhitter experience; when he introduces; in one of his tales, the arrival\r\nof a corregidor at an inn; and says, \"The inn-keeper and his wife were\r\nboth frightened to death, for as when comets appear they always engender\r\nfear of disaster, so when the officers of justice enter a house of a\r\nsudden and unexpectedly, they alarm and agitate the consciences even of\r\nthe innocent.\" It appears that at this time the tribunal of the\r\n_contaduria_ examined the treasury accounts with the greatest severity,\r\nemptied as it had been by the various wars which had been carried and by\r\nfinancial experiments which had failed.\r\n[Sidenote: 1597.\r\nÆtat.\r\n50.]\r\nThe inspector-general, of whom Cervantes was merely the agent, was sent\r\nfor to Madrid to give in his accounts. He represented that the documents\r\nwhich served as vouchers were at Seville in the hands of Cervantes; upon\r\nthis, without other form of trial, a royal order was sent to arrest him,\r\nand to send him under escort to the prison of the capital, where he was\r\nto be disposed of as the tribunal of accounts saw fit. Cervantes was\r\naccordingly thrown in prison. The deficit of which he was accused\r\namounted only to 2644 rials, not quite 30_l_. He offered security for\r\nthis sum, and was set at liberty, on condition that in thirty days he\r\nshould appear before the _contaduria_, and liquidate his accounts. In\r\nall this, it is evident that no real accusation was levelled against\r\nCervantes, and that it was only the clumsy and arbitrary proceedings of\r\nSpanish law that occasioned his imprisonment.\r\n\r\nSome years after the claim of the treasury was revived; the inspector of\r\nBaza, Gaspar Osorio de Tejada, sent in his accounts, at the end of 1602;\r\nthese included an acknowledgment from Cervantes, proving, that sum\r\nhad been received by him in 1594, when he was commissioned to recover\r\nclaims in arrear on that town and district.\r\n[Sidenote: 1602.\r\nÆtat.\r\n55.]\r\nHaving consulted on this point, the judges of the court of the treasury\r\nmade a report, dated Valladolid, January the 24th, 1603, in which they\r\ngave an account of the arrest of Cervantes in 1597 for this same sum,\r\nand his conditional enlargement, adding that since then he had not\r\nappeared before them.\r\n[Sidenote: 1603.\r\nÆtat.\r\n56.]\r\nIt appears that in this very year, 1603, Cervantes removed with his\r\nfamily to Valladolid, where Philip III. resided with his court. There is\r\nno trace, however, of any proceedings against him; and it is evident\r\nthat there was proof of his honesty sufficient to satisfy the officers\r\nof the treasury; and his honour in this and every other transaction\r\nstands clear. His poverty was the great and clinging evil of his life.\r\nMany housekeeping accounts, and notes, and bills, have been discovered\r\nat Valladolid, proving the distress which he and his family suffered. In\r\n1603 there is a memorandum showing that his sister, donna Andrea, was\r\nengaged in superintending the household and wardrobe of a don Pedro de\r\nToledo Osorio, marquis of Villafranca, lately returned from an\r\nexpedition to Algiers.\r\n\r\nAll these dates and papers seem to cast a gleam of light upon the\r\nhistory of Cervantes; yet after all they but render the \"darkness\r\nvisible,\" and these tiny lights becoming extinguished, we grope blinder\r\nthan ever. It is generally supposed that Cervantes left Seville at the\r\ntime of the death of Philip II. (1599). We find that he was at\r\nValladolid in 1603, but both before and after this date it would appear\r\nthat he resided in the province of La Mancha. His perfect knowledge of\r\nthat country, his familiarity with its peculiarities, the lakes of\r\nRuydera, the cave of Motesinos, the position of the fulling mills, and\r\nother places mentioned in \"Don Quixote,\" shows an intimate knowledge of\r\nthe face of the country, to be gained only by a residence. The common\r\nconjecture is that he resided for several years in La Mancha, where he\r\nhad several relations, acting as agent for various persons, and\r\nexecuting such commissions as were intrusted to him, and which brought\r\nin some small income. But adversity followed him here also, and again he\r\nbecame an inmate of a prison; wherefore cannot be discovered. The people\r\nof La Mancha were singularly quarrelsome. About this time they entered\r\non lawsuits and contentions one with another, concerning some silly\r\nrights of precedence, which they pursued with such acrimony and\r\nvehemence, that the population of the province became diminished.\r\n\r\nTo some such litigious proceeding Cervantes was probably the victim. It\r\nhas been said that this disaster happened at Toboso, on account of a\r\nsarcasm he had uttered against a woman, and that her relations thus\r\navenged her. The common and the probable notion, however, is that the\r\ninhabitants of the village of Argamasilla de Alba threw him into prison,\r\nbeing incensed against him, either because he claimed the arrears of\r\ntithes due to the grand prior of San Juan, or because he interfered with\r\ntheir system of irrigation, by turning aside a portion of the waters of\r\nthe Guadiana, for the purpose of preparing saltpetre. To this day they\r\nshow in Argamasilla de Alba an old house called Casa de Medrano, which\r\nimmemorial tradition declares to have been the prison of Cervantes. It\r\nseems likely that he was confined for some time; and he was forced to\r\nhave recourse to his uncle don Juan Barnabé de Saavedra, a citizen of\r\nAlcazar de San Juan, asking for protection and assistance. We are told\r\nthat the expressions of a letter written by Cervantes to this uncle are\r\nremembered, and that it began with these words: \"Long days and short but\r\nsleepless nights wear me out in this prison, or rather let me call it\r\ncavern.\" In record of his ill-treatment here, he at the same time placed\r\nthe residence of Don Quixote, in Argamasilla de Alba and refrained from\r\nmentioning the name, saying, \"In a village of La Mancha, whose name I do\r\nnot wish to recollect.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here not to remember the beautiful image of lord Bacon,\r\nthat calamity acts on the high-minded as the crushing of perfumes,\r\npressing the innate virtue out of each: for in this prison Cervantes\r\nwrote \"Don Quixote.\" When we consider the ill-fortune that pursued\r\nhim--his military career, which left him maimed and unrewarded--his\r\ncaptivity in Algiers, where he exerted a spirit of resistance sublime in\r\nits fearlessness and its risks, and whence he returned a beggar--his\r\nlife spent as a sort of clerk where he gained his scanty daily bread, at\r\nthe mercy of the arbitrary and litigious ministers of Spanish\r\njustice--and that he endured all the distresses incident to straitened\r\nmeans and friendlessness; when we consider that the end of all was to\r\nthrow him into a squalid prison in an obscure village, where he must\r\nhave felt all hopes, not only of advancement, but of attaining the means\r\nof existence, fail him--where in a dreary cavern-like chamber he passed\r\nlong days and sleepless nights, weary and worn out:--when we think that\r\nhe was now fifty-six years of age, a period when the fire of life burns\r\ndim--and then, when we compare all these sad depressing circumstances\r\nwith the very outset of \"Don Quixote,\" we feel that there must have been\r\nsomething divine in the spirit of this man, which could place a soul\r\nwithin the ribs of death, and vivify darkness and suffering with so\r\nanimated a creation.\r\n\r\nHe himself speaks more modestly. \"What,\" he says, in his preface to \"Don\r\nQuixote,\" \"could my barren and uncultivated understanding engender\r\nexcept the history of an offspring, dry, tough, and whimsical, and full\r\nof various fancies which had never entered the imagination of\r\nanother?--like one born in prison, where every discomfort dwells, and\r\nevery odious sound has birth.\"\r\n\r\nWith this we turn to the book itself, and it seems to us that if\r\nCervantes had never written more than the first chapter, his genius and\r\noriginality had been acknowledged by all. There is so much life, such\r\nminute yet clear and characteristic painting--such an outset, promising\r\nso much, and in itself performing so much--that, but for its wisdom, it\r\nseems written by a man who had never known a check nor care. He must\r\nhave felt happy while he wrote it; though the excitement of composition\r\nbrings with it a reaction which, more than any other exercise of the\r\nbrain, demands amusement and change. To turn exhausted from the written\r\npage, and find solitude and a dungeon walls about him, might well make\r\nhim feel that imagination sterile, which was indeed exhausted by the\r\nvery fertility and beauty of its creations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1604.\r\nÆtat.\r\n57.]\r\n\r\nIn 1604, Cervantes returned to what in Spain is called the court, that\r\nis, the town in which the monarch resided. He had left it thirteen years\r\nbefore, in hopes of earning a subsistence by the employment offered him.\r\nHe had lived in poverty, and experienced a variety of disasters. During\r\nthis period he had never thought of obtaining an income through\r\nauthorship. Now he had with him that which in truth has proved to be his\r\npassport to immortality, and the admiration of the world. We may believe\r\nthat an innate sense of the merit of his work led him to consider that\r\nhe was not too sanguine in hoping thence to derive such profit and\r\nreputation as would rescue him from the distresses to which he had\r\nhitherto been the victim. But from first to last, in a worldly view,\r\nCervantes was born to disappointment. His first attempt was to introduce\r\nhimself to the notice of the duke of Lerma, the \"Atlas of the monarchy,\"\r\nas he calls him. The haughty favourite received him with disdain; and\r\nCervantes, not less proud, renounced at once the humiliating task of\r\nseeking his favour.\r\n\r\nHis best and immediate resource was to print his book. But not only the\r\nfashion of the times demanded that it should be introduced under the\r\nnominal patronage of some great man, but the very title and nature of\r\n\"Don Quixote\" rendered it necessary that in some way the public should\r\nfrom the outset be prepossessed in its favour, and let into the secret\r\nof its intentions. Cervantes applied to don Alonzo Lopez de Zuniga y\r\nSotomayor, seventh duke of Bejar, a man who with literary pretensions\r\nhimself, was pleased to arrogate the reputation of a patron of genius. A\r\nstory is told, that the duke, understanding either that the work in\r\nquestion was a romance of chivalry, or that it was a burlesque, thought\r\nin either case his dignity compromised by its being introduced under the\r\npatronage of his name, and refused the author's request. Cervantes, in\r\nreply, only begged permission to read a chapter of his work to him; this\r\nwas granted: the first chapter is enough indeed to awaken curiosity, to\r\nengage interest, and promise a rich harvest of amusement. The duke and\r\nhis friends were so delighted, that they asked for another, and another\r\nchapter, till the whole book was read; and the duke, giving up his\r\nprepossession, gladly yielded his consent to be in a manner\r\nimmortalised, by having his name inscribed on the first page of the\r\nwork. It is added, that a morose priest, who was religious director of\r\nthe duke, was shocked at the immorality of the work, and bitterly\r\ncensured both it and its author. He, they say, was the original of the\r\npriest, at the duke and duchess's table in the second part, whom\r\nCervantes takes to task for his impertinent interference. Whatever truth\r\nthere be in this story, and whether influenced by this ecclesiastic, or\r\nthe worldly feeling that hardens the hearts of the prosperous against\r\nthose who really need assistance, certainly the duke was no generous\r\npatron. Cervantes never dedicated another work to him, nor makes\r\nallusion, and he was ready enough to do so, when merited, to any\r\nkindness received from him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1605.\r\nÆtat.\r\n58.]\r\n\r\nTradition preserves the story, that even when published, \"Don Quixote\"\r\nmet with no popularity, and was hailed with no glad welcome. The author\r\nwas obscure--he had written nothing previously that had won the public\r\near, and so opened the way to success: the very title of the book\r\nexcited the censure and ridicule of common critics. It was in danger of\r\nbecoming a dead letter. Cervantes perceived that his readers did not\r\nunderstand the scope of the book; but he felt its merits, and was sure\r\nthat if once the public were incited to read, its general popularity\r\nmust ensue. To allure attention therefore, and awaken curiosity, it is\r\nsaid that he published an anonymous pamphlet, which he called the\r\n\"Buscapié,\" (a name given to those little fusees or serpents, thrown\r\nforward in military operations to give light to a night mark), which\r\naffected to criticise his book, and insinuated, at the same time, that\r\nit was a covert and fine satire on several well known persons; at the\r\nsame time, not mentioning who or what these personages were.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the \"Buscapié\" has been disputed, as well as that\r\nCervantes was its author. Tradition asserted it, and brought its weighty\r\ntestimony; but in addition to this, Los Rios brings forward a letter of\r\na friend of his, don Antonio Ruidiaz, who saw and read the pamphlet, and\r\ngives the following account of it[66]:--\"I saw the 'Buscapié' in the\r\nhouse of the late count de Saceda about sixteen years ago, and I read it\r\nin the short space of time for which that learned gentleman lent it me;\r\nto whom also it had been lent, by I know not who, for a few days only.\r\nIt was an anonymous pamphlet, in duodecimo, printed in this court, (_en\r\nesta Corte--Madrid so called while the king made residence there_,) with\r\nthat title only. I do not remember the date of the year, nor the\r\nprinter's name: it contained about six sheets--good print, but bad\r\npaper. I will mention what my imperfect memory retains of its contents.\"\r\n\r\n\"The author begins by mentioning, or feigning, that a book had been\r\npublished some time ago, entitled, 'Don Quixote de la Mancha,' but that\r\nfor some time he had felt no inclination to read it, conceiving that it\r\nwas only one of the romances of the day, or that its author had not\r\ntalent sufficient to produce a work of any excellence. For this reason,\r\nhe, like most others, felt no desire to read it; till at last,\r\ninfluenced by mere curiosity, he bought it, and having read it once, he\r\nfelt impelled to read it again with more pleasure and attention; and\r\nthen he became convinced that it was one of the cleverest books that had\r\nseen light, and a satire full of information and amusement, and written\r\nwith the greatest dexterity and cleverness, for the purpose of\r\ndispelling the enthusiasm which the nation in general, and principally\r\nthe nobles, felt for works of chivalry; and that the persons introduced\r\nwere merely imaginary, brought in only for the sake of indicating those\r\nwhose heads were thus turned. Nevertheless, it was not so entirely\r\nimaginary, but that an allusion might be perceived to the character and\r\nchivalrous actions of a certain champion, a favourite of fame, and of\r\nother paladins who had sought to imitate him, as well as other persons\r\nwho had charge of the government of a most extensive and wealthy region\r\nof former times. The author went on to compare the incidents; and,\r\nalthough he artfully disguises some, he nevertheless plainly showed that\r\nhe had in view the enterprises and gallantry of Charles V., as most of\r\nthe points apply to this hero, though so veiled, both with regard to him\r\nand other persons, that it is impossible to point them out. At length he\r\nconcluded, by saying, that to compensate to the author for the injury he\r\nhad done him in the first instance, and to undeceive the prepossession\r\nof others, and that they might discover the treasure hid under that\r\ntitle, he had resolved to publish the \"Buscapié,\" which might excite\r\nthe attention of the unoccupied (which was almost all Spain), and entice\r\nthem to take the book in hand and read it, well persuaded that whoever\r\nonce cast his eyes on it, would appreciate at its just value that which\r\nthey had before despised.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this story be true, and whether \"Don Quixote\" owed its first\r\ncelebrity to the \"Buscapié,\" we will not decide; though I own I am led\r\nto reject it as unworthy. Cervantes makes no allusion to it in his after\r\nworks; and it seems more probable that it was written by some friend or\r\ndisciple, than by himself. It is said that the trick succeeded: at any\r\nrate, the book at first excited no attention, and then, suddenly coming\r\ninto vogue, it was devoured with insatiable curiosity.\r\n[Sidenote: 1605.]\r\nFour editions were published in Spain in one year, and its fame became\r\nspread to all neighbouring countries, and in no long time reached this\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nBooks in those days sometimes enriched authors by gaining for them\r\npatrons and pensions; the mere sale brought no great profit. No doubt\r\nCervantes's distress was somewhat alleviated; but still poverty clung to\r\nhim, while his very success excited the enmity of a variety of the men\r\nof letters of the day, who could not endure that a man whose talents\r\nthey had regarded with no consideration, should suddenly pass over the\r\nheads of all: a cloud of satires, epigrams, and criticism were levelled\r\nagainst his work. Old rough doctor Johnson would have revelled in such\r\ntestimony of his popularity, and Cervantes was at least secure in having\r\nthe laugh on his side. Los Rios, however, observes, that if the many\r\nsatires, attacks, and persecutions, which the author and his book\r\nsuffered had not been submerged in oblivion, or drowned in the quantity\r\nof eulogies and defences heaped on him by men of talent, who continued\r\nto subtract such disagreeable productions from the eyes of posterity, it\r\nwould now appear, that \"Don Quixote\" had been written in the midst of a\r\nnation enemy to the muses. Now the attacks of these men redound to their\r\nown discredit, displaying only their envy or incredible bad taste.\r\nCervantes indeed had not spared the authors of his time, and they almost\r\nall set themselves in array against him. Lope de Vega, from the height\r\nof his prosperity, showed a condescending good nature, which,\r\nconsidering that he was attacked in \"Don Quixote,\" shows a sort of lion\r\nmagnanimity: he even declared that the writings of Cervantes were not\r\ndevoid of grace or style. Don Luis de Gongora, a man of whom further\r\nmention will be made in this work, was his most virulent critic.\r\nFiguero, and Villegas both contributed their mite of disapprobation. We\r\ncannot tell how Cervantes viewed their attacks, but his warm heart must\r\nhave been pained at the falling off of some of his friends; among these\r\nwas Vicente Espinel, who had merit enough as a poet, perfect in his\r\nclass, to hail with pleasure, instead of enviously depreciating, the\r\nmerit of his friend.\r\n\r\nCervantes mentions some of these satires, and in particular, one sent to\r\nhim in a letter when he was at Valladolid.[67]\r\n[Sidenote: 1605.]\r\nThe circumstances accompanying this letter show that he was settled and\r\nhad a house in that city. Philip III. had established his court there,\r\nand doubtless Cervantes thought that in the first flush of success his\r\nbeing in its immediate neighbourhood might occasion some noble to become\r\nhis patron. When Philip IV. was born, James I. of England sent admiral\r\nlord Howard to present a treaty of peace, and to congratulate Philip\r\nIII. on the birth of his son.\r\n[Sidenote: 1605.]\r\nHe was received with the utmost magnificence: bull fights, tournaments,\r\nmasked balls, religious ceremonies--all of feasting and splendour that\r\nthe court could display, were put in requisition The duke of Lerma\r\ncaused an account of these festivities to be written: it is said that\r\nCervantes was the author.\r\n\r\nThese rejoicings were scarcely over when an event occurred greatly to\r\ndistress Cervantes, who seems to have been marked out by fortune for the\r\nendurance of every variety of galling disaster.\r\n\r\nThere lived in Valladolid a cavalier of Saint-Jago, don Gaspar de\r\nEzpeleta, an intimate acquaintance of the marquis de Falces. On the\r\nnight of the 27th of June, 1605, this gentleman, having supped, as he\r\noften did, with his friend, returned home on foot over an open field to\r\na wooden bridge over the river Esqueva. He was here met by a stranger\r\nwrapped in a large cloak, who accosted him with incivility, and a\r\nquarrel ensuing, they drew their swords, and don Gaspar fell pierced by\r\nmany wounds. Calling for help, and bleeding profusely, he staggered on\r\ntowards a house near the bridge; part of the first floor of this house\r\nwas occupied by donna Luisa de Montoya, widow of the historian Esteban\r\nde Garibay, with her two sons; the other part by Cervantes and his\r\nfamily. The cries of the wounded man drew the attention of one of the\r\nsons of Garibay, who rousing Cervantes, who had gone to bed, they\r\nproceeded to his assistance. They found him lying at their porch, his\r\nsword in one hand and buckler in another, and carried him into the\r\napartment of donna Luisa, where he expired on the following day. An\r\ninquest was held by the alcayd de casa y corte. Cristobal de Villarroel,\r\nwho, like all other officers of justice in Spain, took the safe side of\r\nsuspecting the worst, and throwing every body into prison. Cervantes,\r\nhis wife, donna Catalina de Palacios y Salazar; his daughter donna\r\nIsabel de Saavedra, twenty years of age; his sister donna Andrea de\r\nCervantes, who was a widow, with a daughter named donna Costanza de\r\nOvando, twenty-eight years of age; a nun called donna Magdalena de\r\nSotomayor, who was also termed a sister of Cervantes; his servant maid\r\nMaria de Cevallos, and two friends, who were staying in his house, one\r\nnamed Señor de Cigales, and a Portuguese, Simon Mendez, made their\r\ndepositions, and were indiscriminately thrown into prison. It is so\r\nusual in Italy as well as Spain to suppose that all those who come to\r\nthe assistance of a murdered man, have had a hand in his assassination,\r\nthat such an act probably excited no wonder. After a confinement of\r\neight days, and a vast quantity of interrogation they were, on giving\r\nsecurity, set at liberty. The depositions taken on this occasion show\r\nthat Cervantes was still employed as an agent. When we consider that he\r\nmaintained all these relations, we wonder less at his poverty, while we\r\nadmire his liberality and kindness of heart. Nor can we help remarking\r\nfrom this enumeration of his household, that Cervantes had that\r\npredilection for women's society which characterises the gentler and\r\nmore gifted of his sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1606.\r\nÆtat.\r\n59.]\r\n\r\nThough it is impossible to fix dates with any precision, there is reason\r\nto believe that when the court returned to Madrid in 1606; Cervantes\r\nfollowed it, and continued to inhabit that city to the end of his life.\r\nThe freedom and society of a capital is always agreeable to a literary\r\nman; and his native town of Alcalà de Henares; and his wife's of\r\nEsquivias were at a convenient distance. It has been ascertained that in\r\nJune, 1609, he lived in the Calle (street) de la Magdelena; a little\r\nafter; behind the college of Nuestra Señora de Loretto; in June; 1610,\r\nat 9 Calle del Leon; in 1614 in Calle de Las Huertas; afterwards, in the\r\nCalle de el Duque de Alva, at the corner of St. Isidoro; and lastly, in\r\n1616, at 20 Calle del Leon, where he died.\r\n\r\nIt must rather have been the capital than the court that attracted him,\r\nfor he lived in obscurity and neglect. He had only two friends of rank,\r\nwho allowed him some small income; these were don Bernardo de Sandoval\r\ny Rojas, archbishop of Toledo, and don Pedro Fernandez de Castro, count\r\nof Lemos; and this was done through no solicitation on the part of\r\nCervantes, nor in reward for any adulatory dedication, but simply out of\r\nadmiration for his talent, and sympathy for his poverty.[68] At this\r\ntime despotism and bigotry were extending their influence. Spain had\r\ndegenerated, and letters, cultivated not long before with enthusiasm,\r\nwere falling into neglect. The nobility surrounded themselves with\r\njesters and flatterers, neglecting men of merit. Of the few of the old\r\nleaven, men admiring talent, and desirous of serving it, were the\r\ncardinal de Toledo, and the count of Lemos. The first was respected for\r\nhis retired habits and generosity; the other for his munificence and\r\npopularity. The cardinal treated men of letters with kindness and\r\nurbanity. The count sought out the necessitous and suffering among them,\r\nassisting them at their need with unlimited generosity.\r\n\r\nIn 1610 the count of Lemos was named viceroy of Naples; and here again\r\nCervantes was doomed to disappointment. The count of Lemos held in high\r\nesteem the two Argensolas. These brothers, Lupercio and Bartolomé\r\nLeonardo de Argensola, were of a family originally of Ravenna in Italy,\r\nand settled in Aragon. They were surnamed the Horaces of Spain. Before\r\nhe was twenty, Lupercio wrote three tragedies, which met with success,\r\nand which Cervantes praises highly in \"Don Quixote:\" too highly, indeed,\r\nfor they are of the old school, wanting in verisimilitude and\r\nregularity, and not elevated by the merits of poetry. Philip III.\r\nappointed him historiographer of the kingdom of Aragon. Bartolomé, his\r\njunior by a year, was an ecclesiastic and also a poet. These brothers\r\nwere residing at Saragossa, when the count, wishing to have them with\r\nhim, offered Lupercio the place of secretary of state and war at Naples,\r\nand requested that his brother should accompany him. The count also\r\nconfided to them the charge of choosing the persons to fulfil the under\r\nplaces in their office, and they, confiding in the counts taste,\r\nselected various poets for this purpose.\r\n\r\nCervantes was their friend; he had reason to hope that they would use\r\ntheir interest when arrived at Naples to advance him. But he was\r\ndisappointed. He takes a gentle revenge in his \"Voyage to Parnassus.\"\r\nMercury bids him invite the two Argensolas to assist in the conquest of\r\nParnassus, but Cervantes excuses himself, saying, \"I am afraid they\r\nwould not listen to me--although I am desirous to oblige in all\r\nthings--since I have been told that my will and my eyes are both\r\nshort-sighted, and my poverty-stricken appearance would ill suit such a\r\njourney. They have fulfilled none of the many promises they made me at\r\nparting. Much I hoped--for they promised much; but perhaps their new\r\noccupations have caused them to forget what they then said.\"[69]\r\n\r\nCervantes meanwhile had relinquished business, or nearly so: his means,\r\nconsidering the number of persons he maintained, were strait indeed: he\r\nfelt that he was neglected, while others of far less talent basked in\r\nthe favour of the court. But he did not hunt after patrons nor pension:\r\nhe lived quiet and secluded, expecting nothing, repining at\r\nnothing--content, if not satisfied.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly strange that in those days, when it was considered a\r\npart of a noble's duty to protect and patronise men of letters, that\r\nCervantes should have been thus passed over. Some men join a sort of\r\nquerulousness and snarling independence to considerable self-esteem,\r\nwhich renders it difficult to oblige them. But there was no trace of\r\nanything of the sort in Cervantes--no trace of any quarrel or complaint;\r\nnor, though himself obscure, was his book unknown. There is a story told\r\nof Philip III., that he was one day standing in the balcony of his\r\npalace at Madrid, overlooking the Manzanares, and he observed a student\r\nwalking on the banks of the river, reading, and interrupting himself\r\nevery now and then with strange gesticulations and bursts of laughter.\r\nThe king exclaimed, \"Either that man is mad, or he is reading \"Don\r\nQuixote.'\" The courtiers around, eager to confirm their sovereign's\r\nsagacity, started off to ascertain the fact, and found indeed that the\r\nbook the student held was \"Don Quixote;\" yet not one among them\r\nremembered to remind their sovereign that the author of that delightful\r\nwork lived poor and forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn the licence to print the \"Second Part of Don Quixote,\" another story\r\nis told, showing how the Spaniards themselves regarded the obscurity in\r\nwhich they suffered the author to live: it is related by the licentiate,\r\nFrancisco Marquez Torres, master of the pages to the archbishop of\r\nToledo, to whom the censorship of the work was intrusted. He relates\r\nthat in 1615, an ambassador arrived at Madrid from Paris, whose object\r\nbeing complimentary, he was followed by a numerous suite of nobles and\r\ngentlemen of rank and education. Among others, the ambassador visited\r\nthe archbishop of Toledo. On the 25th February, 1615, the archbishop\r\nreturned the visit, accompanied by various churchmen and chaplains, and,\r\namong others, by the licentiate, Marquez Torres, himself. While the\r\narchbishop paid his visit, those of his suite conversed with the French\r\ngentlemen present, and they discussed the merits of various works of\r\ntalent then popular, and in particular of the \"Second Part of Don\r\nQuixote,\" then about to appear. When the foreign cavaliers heard the\r\nname of Cervantes, they all began to speak at once, and to declare the\r\nestimation in which he was held in France. Their praises were such, that\r\nthe licentiate Marquez Torres offered to take them to the house of the\r\nauthor, that they might see and know him--an offer accepted with\r\ndelight, while a thousand questions were asked concerning the age,\r\nprofession, rank, and situation of Cervantes. The licentiate was obliged\r\nto confess that he was a gentleman and a soldier, but old and poor; and\r\nhis reply so moved one of his audience, that he exclaimed, \"Is it\r\npossible that Spain does not maintain such a man, in honour and comfort\r\nfrom the public purse?\" While another, with less warmth of heart, though\r\nequal admiration, exclaimed, \"If necessity obliges him to write, may he\r\nnever be rich! for, being poor, he by his works enriches the\r\nworld;\"--words to comfort, with the hope of fame, one whose life was\r\nclouded by penury and neglect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1608.\r\nÆtat.\r\n61.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot help observing that the court and the nobles did not form the\r\nwhole world. Cervantes had many dear, many well-informed and valued\r\nfriends, and among these he could forget the carelessness of those who\r\nconsidered all reputation and prosperity to be inclosed within their\r\nmagic circle; while in the case of Cervantes, it is proved that though\r\nneglected by them, the whole world rung with his fame and praise.\r\n\r\nFor some years Cervantes published nothing more. In 1608 he brought out\r\na corrected edition of the \"First Part of Don Quixote.\" He was employed,\r\nmeanwhile, in a variety of works which appeared afterwards in quick\r\nsuccession, on which he employed himself at the same time. His \"Voyage\r\nto Parnassus\" peculiarly engaged his attention, but he feared that the\r\npublication, with its gentle attack on the Argensolas, might displease\r\nhis kind patron, the count of Lemos. He therefore brought out first his\r\n\"Twelve Tales\" (\"Novelas Exemplares\") which raised yet higher his\r\ncharacter as an author. These tales are dedicated in a few respectful\r\nlines to the count of Lemos; the preface to them is very interesting.\r\nCervantes has been accused unjustly of vanity and boasting: of this he\r\nis innocent; but he had something of that feeling, the inherent quality\r\nof authors, which led him to dwell on his own idea and fortunes (what\r\ncould be nearer, or better known, or more deeply felt by him?) the same\r\nthat led Rousseau to make his confessions, and which when indulged in\r\nwith good faith and without querulousness, sits well on a writer, and\r\ninterests us in him. \"I should be well content,\" he says, \"to be excused\r\nthis preface, and to give instead my portrait, such as it was painted by\r\nthe famous don Juan de Jauregui: with this my ambition would be\r\nsatisfied; and the curiosity would be gratified of those who desire to\r\nknow what the countenance and person is of him who has dared bring\r\nbefore the world so many inventions; and below the portrait I would\r\nplace these words: 'He whom you here see with a face resembling an\r\neagle's with chesnut brown hair, smooth and open brow, vivacious eyes, a\r\nhooked yet well-proportioned nose; with a beard now silver, but which\r\ntwenty years ago was golden; thick mustachios and small mouth;\r\nill-formed teeth, of which but few remain; a person between two\r\nextremes, neither tall nor short; of sanguine complexion, rather fair\r\nthan dark; somewhat heavy about the shoulders, and not very light of\r\nfoot;--this, I say, is the face of the author of 'Galatea,' and of 'Don\r\nQuixote de la Mancha,'--he who, in imitation of Cæsar Caporal, the\r\nPerugian, made a voyage to Parnassus, and wrote other works, which\r\nwander lost, even with their master's name. He is usually called Miguel\r\nde Cervantes Saavedra. He was for many years a soldier, and a captive\r\nfor more than five, where he learned to bear adversity with patience. In\r\nthe naval battle of Lepanto he lost his left hand by a shot from an\r\narquebuse, a wound which may appear a deformity, but which he considers\r\na beauty, having received it on the most memorable and noble event which\r\npast ages ever saw, or those to come can hope to witness--fighting under\r\nthe victorious banners of the son of that lustre of war, Charles V., of\r\nhappy memory.\"\r\n\r\nThere is certainly nothing boastful nor ungraceful in this--rather are\r\nwe glad to find how Cervantes, old and poor, could dwell with\r\ncomplacency on past adversity, and cast the halo of glory round his\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1614.\r\nÆtat.\r\n67.]\r\n\r\nThese tales established more firmly than ever the high reputation of\r\nCervantes, and he now ventured to publish his \"Voyage to Parnassus;\" and\r\nafter this the least successful of his publications, or, rather, that\r\nwhich is the only failure among them--his volume of \"Comedias y\r\nEntremeses,\" which he composed according to the new school introduced by\r\nLope de Vega, but which were never acted. In his preface to this work he\r\ngives some account of the origin of the Spanish drama, and the\r\namelioration that be, in his younger days, introduced, which has already\r\nbeen quoted. He goes on to say, \"Called away by other occupations, I\r\nlaid aside my pen, and meanwhile Lope de Vega, that prodigy of nature,\r\nappeared, and raised himself to the sovereignty of the drama. He\r\nvanquished and reduced under his dominion all writers of plays: he\r\nfilled the world with dramas, excellently written and well conceived,\r\nand that in so great number, that ten thousand sheets of paper would not\r\ncontain them; and, what is surprising, he has seen them all acted, or\r\nknown that they were acted. All those who have wished to share the glory\r\nof his labours, collectively, have not written the half of what he alone\r\nhas given forth. And when,\" he continues, \"I returned to the old\r\nemployment of my leisure, fancying that the age which echoed my praises\r\nstill endured, I began again to write plays, but I found no birds in the\r\naccustomed nest--I mean, I found no manager who asked for them, although\r\nhe was informed that they were written; I threw them, therefore, into\r\nthe corner of a trunk, and condemned them to eternal silence. A\r\nbookseller then told me that he would have bought them, if an author of\r\nreputation had not told him, that my prose was worth something; but\r\nnothing could be expected from my verse. To confess the truth, these\r\nwords mortified me deeply; without doubt, I am either much changed, or\r\nthe age has arrived at a higher degree of perfection, against the usual\r\ncourse of things, for I have always heard past times praised. I re-read\r\nmy comedies, as well as some interludes I had mingled with them, and I\r\nfound that they were not so bad, but that I might bring them out from\r\nwhat an author calls darkness, to what others may, perhaps, name day. I\r\ngrew angry, and sold them to the bookseller who now publishes them. He\r\ngave me a reasonable price, and I received the money without caring for\r\nthe rebuffs of the actors. I wish that they were the best ever written;\r\nand if, dear reader, you find any thing good in them, I wish when you\r\nmeet this ill-natured author, you would tell him to repent, and not to\r\njudge them so severely, since, after all, they contain no incongruities\r\nnor striking faults.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the author was right--the pieces are very bad; so bad,\r\nthat when Blas de Nasano reprinted them a century afterwards, he could\r\nfind nothing better to say of them, than that they were purposely\r\nwritten badly, in ridicule of the extravagant plays then in vogue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1615.\r\nÆtat.\r\n68.]\r\n\r\nCervantes published another slight work in this year. The custom of\r\npoetic games (giustas poeticas) was still preserved in Spain, which had\r\nbeen instituted even from the time of John II. Pope Paul V. having, in\r\n1614, canonised the famous Saint Theresa, her apotheosis was given as\r\nthe subject for competition. Lope de Vega was named one of the judges.\r\nCervantes entered the lists, and sent in an ode; it did not receive the\r\nprize, but it is published among those selected as the best, in the\r\naccount written of the feasts which all Spain celebrated in honour of a\r\nnative and illustrious saint.\r\n\r\nTwo works employed Cervantes at this time--\"Persiles and Sigismunda,\"\r\nand the \"Second Part of Don Quixote.\" He appears to have intended to\r\nbring out the former first, but the publication of Avellanada's \"Don\r\nQuixote\" caused him to hasten the appearance of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe name of the real author of this book is unknown; he assumed that of\r\nthe licentiate Alonzo Fernandez de Avellanada, a native of Tordesillas.\r\nNo plagiarism is more impudent and inexcusable. Don Quixote and Sancho\r\nPanza were the offspring and the property of Cervantes: to take these\r\noriginal and unparalleled creations out of his hands--to make them speak\r\nand act according to the fancy of another, and that while he was alive,\r\nand still occupied in adorning them with fresh deeds and thoughts, all\r\nhis own, is a sort of theft no talent could excuse. Avellanada's \"Don\r\nQuixote\" is not destitute of talent; but it is impossible to read\r\nit--the mind of the reader is tormented by finding another knight, and\r\nanother esquire, whom he is called to look upon as the same, but who are\r\nvery different. The adventures are clever enough; but the soul of the\r\nactors is gone. Don Quixote is no longer the perfect gentleman, with\r\nfeelings so noble, pure, and imaginative, and Sancho is a lout, whose\r\ntalk is folly, without the salt of wit. Cervantes, heartily disgusted,\r\nand highly indignant, hastened to publish his continuation. In\r\ndedicating his comedies to the count of Lemos, at the commencement of\r\n1615, he says, \"Don Quixote has buckled oh his spurs, and is hastening\r\nto kiss the feet of your excellency. I am afraid he will arrive a little\r\nout of humour, because he lest his way, and was ill-treated at\r\nTarragona: nevertheless, he has proved, upon examination, that he is not\r\nthe hero of that story, but another who wished to look like him, but did\r\nnot succeed.\"\r\n\r\nIn his dedication of the Second Part to the count of Lemos, he says, in\r\nnot ungraceful allusion to the extent of his fame, while at the same\r\ntime he covertly alludes to his expectation of being invited to Naples,\r\n\"Many have told me to hurry it, to get rid for them of the disgust\r\ncaused by another Quixote, who, under the name of the Second Part, has\r\nwandered through the world. And he who has shown himself most impatient\r\nis the great emperor of China, who a month ago wrote me a letter in\r\nChinese, asking, or rather entreating me to send it for he was desirous\r\nof founding a college for the study of the Castilian language, and he\r\nwished \"Don Quixote\" to be the book read in it; at the same time,\r\noffering that I should be rector of the college: but I replied that I\r\nhad not health to undertake so long a journey; and besides being ill, I\r\nwas poor; and emperor for emperor, and monarch for monarch, there was\r\nthe great count of Lemos at Naples, who assisted me as much as I wished,\r\nthough he did not found colleges nor rectorships.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the last work that Cervantes published. He had finished\r\n\"Persiles and Sigismunda,\" and meditated the \"Second Part of Galatea,\"\r\nand two other works, whose subjects we cannot guess, though he has\r\nmentioned the titles (\"Bernardo\" and \"Las Semanas del Jardin\"); but of\r\nthese no trace remains. He published the \"Second Part of Don Quixote\" at\r\nthe end of 1615, and being then sixty-eight years of age, he was\r\nattacked by the malady which not long after caused his death.\r\n[Sidenote: 1616.\r\nÆtat.\r\n69.]\r\nHoping to find relief in the air of the country during spring, on the 2d\r\nof the following April he made an excursion to Esquivias, but, getting\r\nworse, he was obliged to return to Madrid. He narrates his journey back\r\nin his preface to \"Persiles and Sigismunda:\" and in this we find the\r\nonly account we possess of his illness. \"It happened; dear reader; that\r\nas two friends and I were returning from Esquivias--a place famous on\r\nmany accounts;--in the first place for its illustrious families; and\r\nsecondly for its excellent wines;--being arrived near Madrid, we heard,\r\nbehind, a man on horseback, who was spurring his animal to its speed,\r\nand appeared to wish to get up to us, of which he gave proof soon after,\r\ncalling out and begging us to stop; on which we reined up, and saw\r\narrive a country-bred student, mounted on an ass, dressed in grey, with\r\ngaiters and round shoes, a sword and scabbard, and a smooth ruff with\r\nstrings; true it is, that of these he had but two, so that his ruff was\r\nalways falling on one side, and he was at great trouble to put it right.\r\nWhen he reached us, he said, 'Without doubt your Honours are seeking\r\nsome office or pretend at court, from the archbishop of Toledo or the\r\nking, neither more nor less, to judge by the speed you make; for truly\r\nmy ass has been counted the winner of the course more than once.' One of\r\nmy companions replied, 'The horse of señor Miguel de Cervantes is the\r\ncause--he steps out so well.' Scarcely had the student heard the name of\r\nCervantes than he threw himself off his ass, so that his bag and\r\nportmanteau fell to right and left--for he travelled with all this\r\nluggage--and rushing towards me, and seizing my left arm, exclaimed,\r\n'Yes, yes! this is the able hand, the famous being, the delightful\r\nwriter, and, finally, the joy of the muses!' As for me, hearing him\r\naccumulate praises so rapidly, I thought myself obliged in politeness to\r\nreply, and taking him round the neck in a manner which caused his ruff\r\nto fall off altogether, I said, f I am indeed Cervantes, sir; but I am\r\nnot the joy of the muses, nor any of the fine things you say: but go\r\nback to your ass, mount again, and let us converse, for the short\r\ndistance we have before us.\" The good student did as I desired; we\r\nreined in a little, and continued our journey at a more moderate pace.\r\nMeanwhile, my illness was mentioned, and the good student soon gave me\r\nover, saying, 'This is a dropsy, which not all the water of the ocean,\r\ncould you turn it fresh and drink it, would cure. Señor Cervantes,\r\ndrink moderately, and do not forget to eat, for thus you will be cured\r\nwithout the aid of other medicine.' 'Many others have told me the same\r\nthing,' replied; 'but I can no more leave off drinking till I am\r\nsatisfied, than if I were born for this end only. My life is drawing to\r\nits close; and, if I may judge by the quickness of my pulse, it will\r\ncease to beat by next Sunday, and I shall cease to live. You have begun\r\nyour acquaintance with me in an evil hour, since I have not time left to\r\nshow my gratitude for the kindness you have displayed.' At this moment\r\nwe arrived at the bridge of Toledo, by which I entered the town, while\r\nhe followed the road of the bridge of Segovia. What after that happened\r\nto me fame will recount: my friends will publish it, and I shall be\r\ndesirous to hear. I embraced him again; he made me offers of service,\r\nand, spurring his ass, left me as ill, as he was well disposed to pursue\r\nhis journey. Nevertheless, he gave me an excellent subject for\r\npleasantry; but all times are not alike. Perhaps the hour may come when\r\nI can join again this broken thread; and shall be able to say what here\r\nI leave out, and which I ought to say. Now, farewell pleasure! farewell\r\njoy! farewell, my many friends! I am about to die; and I leave you,\r\ndesirous of meeting you soon again, happy, in another life.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is Cervantes's adieu to the world; self-possessed, and animated by\r\nthat resigned and cheerful spirit which accompanied him through life. He\r\nwrote another farewell to his protector, the count of Lemos, in his\r\ndedication of this same work: it is dated 19th April, 1616. \"I should be\r\nglad,\" he says, \"not to apply to myself, as I must, the old verses which\r\nmen formerly celebrated, that begin 'the foot already in the stirrup;'\r\nfor with little alteration, I can say, that with my foot in the stirrup,\r\nand feeling the agonies of death, I write you, great lord, this letter.\r\nYesterday extreme unction was administered me; to-day, I take up my pen;\r\nmy time is short; my pains increase; my hopes fail; yet I wish to live\r\nto see you again in Spain; and perhaps the joy I should then feel would\r\nrestore me to life. However, if I must less it, the will of heaven be\r\ndone; but let your excellency at least be aware of my wish, and learn\r\nthat you had in me an affectionate servant, who desired to show his\r\nservice even beyond death.\" Four days after writing this dedication,\r\nCervantes died, on the 23d of April, 1616, aged sixty-nine. In his will,\r\nhe named his wife, and his neighbour, the licentiate Francisco Nuñez,\r\nhis executors. He ordered that he should be buried in a convent of nuns\r\nof Trinity, founded four years before, in the Calle del Humilladero,\r\nwhere his daughter donna Isabel had a short time before taken the vows.\r\nNo doubt this last wish of Cervantes was complied with; but in 1633, the\r\nnuns left the Calle del Humilladero, and went to inhabit another convent\r\nin the Calle de Cantaranas, and the place of his interment is thus\r\nforgotten; no stone, no tomb, no inscription marks the spot. We have to\r\nregret also the loss of his two portraits, painted by his friends\r\nJauregui and Pacheco: the one we have is a copy made in the reign of\r\nPhilip IV., and attributed to various painters; it resembles the\r\ndescription before quoted, which Cervantes gives of himself.\r\n\r\nIn calling to mind all the events of this great man's life, we are\r\nstruck by the equanimity of temper preserved throughout. As a soldier,\r\nhe showed courage; as a captive, fortitude and daring; as a man\r\nstruggling with adversity, honesty, perseverance, and contentment. He\r\nspeaks of himself as poor, but he never repines. In all the knowledge of\r\nthe world displayed in \"Don Quixote,\" there is no querulousness, no\r\ncausticity, no bitterness: a noble enthusiasm animated him to his end.\r\nDespite his ridicule of books of chivalry, romantic in his own tastes,\r\nhis last work, Persiles and Sigismunda, is more romantic than all. His\r\ngenius, his imagination, his wit, his natural good spirits and\r\naffectionate heart, did, we must hope, stand in lieu of more worldly\r\nblessings, and rendered him as internally happy as they have rendered\r\nhim admirable and praiseworthy to all men to the end of time.[70]\r\n\r\nHis life has been drawn to such a length, that there is no space for a\r\nvery detailed account of his works; still something more must be said.\r\nHis first publication, \"Galatea,\" is beautiful in its spirit,\r\ninteresting and pleasing in its details, but not original: as a work it\r\nis cast in the same mould as other pastorals that went before. Nor was\r\nCervantes a poet. Many men have imagination, and can write verses,\r\nwithout being poets. Coleridge gives an admirable definition: \"Good\r\nprose consists in good words in good places; poetry, in the best words\r\nin the best places,\" Cervantes had imagination and invention: the\r\nSpanish language offered great facility, and he wrote it always with\r\npurity; so that here and there we find lines and stanzas that are\r\npoetry, but, on the whole, there is a want of that concentration, severe\r\ntaste, and perfect ear for harmony that form poetry.\r\n\r\nYet when we recur to the \"Numantia,\" we find this sentence unjust, for\r\nthere is poetry of conception and passion in the \"Numantia\" of the\r\nhighest order; nor is it wanting in that of language. It has been\r\nmentioned that of the twenty or thirty plays which Cervantes says he\r\nwrote, soon after his marriage, \"Numantia\" and \"El Trato de Argel\" (Life\r\nin Algiers) alone remain. They are written on the simplest plan, though\r\nnot on the Greek; they are without choruses, without entanglement of\r\nplot, sustained only by impassioned dialogue and situations of\r\nhigh-wrought interest. The \"Numantia\" is founded on the siege of that\r\ncity, under Scipio Africanus, when the unfortunate inhabitants destroyed\r\nthemselves, their wives and children, and their property, rather than\r\nfall, and let them fall into the conquerors' hands. It is divided into\r\nfour acts: the first two are the least impressive, though containing\r\nscenes of extreme pathos, and well calculated to raise by degrees the\r\ninterest of the reader to the horrors that ensue. Scipio, desirous of\r\nsparing the lives of his men, resolves to assault the city no more, but,\r\ndigging a trench round it on all sides, except where the river flows,\r\nmeans to reduce it by famine. The Numantines determine to endure all to\r\nthe last. They consult the gods, and dark auguries repel every hope: the\r\ndreadful pains of hunger creep about the city; and when two betrothed\r\nmeet, and the lover asks the maiden but to stay awhile that he may gaze\r\non her, he exclaims--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What now? what stand'st thou mutely thinking,\r\nThou of my thought the only treasure?\r\n_Lira._ I'm thinking how thy dream of pleasure\r\nAnd mine so fast away are sinking;\r\nIt will not fall beneath the hand\r\nOf him who wastes our native land.\r\nFor long, or e'er the war be o'er,\r\nMy hapless life shall be no more.\r\n_Morandro._ Joy of my soul, what has thou said?\r\n_Lira._ That I am worn with hunger so,\r\nThat quickly will th' o'erpowering woe\r\nFor ever break my vital thread.\r\nWhat bridal rapture dost thou dream,\r\nFrom one at such a sad extreme?\r\nFor, trust me, ere an hour be past,\r\nI fear I shall have breathed my last.\r\nMy brother fainted yesterday,\r\nBy wasting hunger overborne;\r\nAnd then my mother, all out-worn\r\nBy hunger, slowly sunk away.\r\nAnd if my health can struggle yet\r\nWith hunger's cruel power, in truth\r\nIt is because my stronger youth\r\nIts wasting force hath better mat.\r\nBut now so many a day hath pass'd,\r\nSince aught I've had its powers to strengthen;\r\nIt can no more the conflict lengthen,\r\nBut it must faint and fail at last.\r\n_Morandro._ Lira, dry thy weeping eyes;\r\nBut ah! let mine, my love, the more\r\nTheir overflowing rivers pour,\r\nWailing thy wretched agonies.\r\nBut though thou still art held in strife\r\nWith hunger thus incessantly;\r\nOf hunger still thou shalt not die.\r\nSo long as I retain my life.\r\nI offer here from you high wall,\r\nTo leap o'er ditch and battlement;\r\nThy death one instant to prevent,\r\nI fear not on mine own to fall.\r\nThe bread the Roman eateth now,\r\nI'll snatch away and bear to thee;\r\nFor, oh! 'tis worse than death to see,\r\nLady, thy dreadful state of woe.\"[71]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this the scenes of horror accumulate;--children crying to their\r\nmothers for bread; brothers lamenting over each other's suffering; and\r\nsome repining at, and others nobly anticipating the hour when death and\r\nflames are to envelope all. Such scenes, denuded of their poetry, are\r\nmere horrors; but clothed, as Cervantes has clothed them, in the\r\nlanguage of the affections, and of the loftier passions of the soul, the\r\nreader, even while trembling with the excitement, reads on and exults at\r\nlast, when not a Numantine survives to grace Scipio's triumph. Nothing\r\ncan be more truly national than the drama; and, as if fearful that a\r\nSpanish audience would feel too deeply the catastrophe, he introduces\r\nSpain, the river Duero, War, Sickness, and Famine, as allegorical\r\npersonages, who, while they mourn over the present, prophesy the future\r\ntriumphs of their country. Another merit of this play is one not usual\r\nin Spanish authors: it is of no more than the necessary length to\r\ndevelope its interest; there is no long spinning out, and except quite\r\nat the outset, before the poet had warmed to his subject, it has not a\r\ncold or superfluous line. It is indeed a monument worthy of Cervantes's\r\ngenius, and proves the height to which he could soar, and brings him yet\r\nin closer resemblance to Shakspeare; showing that he could depict the\r\ngrand and terrible, the pathetic and the deeply tragic, with the same\r\nmaster hand. It is said that this tragedy was acted during the frightful\r\nsiege of Saragossa by the French in the last war; and the Spaniards\r\nfound in the example of their forefathers, and in the spirit and genius\r\nof their greatest man, fresh inducements to resist: this is a triumph\r\nfor Cervantes, worthy of him, and shows how truly and how well he could\r\nspeak to the hearts of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn the comedy \"Life in Algiers\" there cannot be said to be any plot at\r\nall. Cervantes brought back from his captivity an intense horror of\r\nChristian suffering in Africa; and he had it much at heart to awaken in\r\nthe minds of his countrymen, not only sympathy, but a spirit of charity,\r\nthat would lead them to assist in the redemption of captives. He thus\r\nbrings forward various pictures of suffering, such as would best move\r\nthe hearts of the audience, and such as he himself had witnessed.\r\nAurelio and Silvia, affianced lovers, are captives, and are respectively\r\nloved by Yusuf and Zara, the Moors who own them. In the old Spanish\r\nstyle, feelings are personified and brought on the stage. Fatima, Zara's\r\nconfidant, seeks by incantations to bend Aurelio to her mistress's will.\r\nShe is told by a Fury, that such power cannot be exercised over a\r\nChristian, but Necessity and Occasion are sent to move him by the\r\nsuggestions they instil by whispers, and which he echoes as his own\r\nthoughts. He almost falls into the snare they present by filling his\r\nmind with prospects of ease and pleasure, in exchange for the hardships\r\nhe undergoes; but he resists the temptation, and is finally set free\r\nwith Silvia. Besides, these, we have the picture of two captives, who\r\nescape and cross the desert to Oran, as Cervantes had once schemed to do\r\nhimself. One of them appears worn and famished--willing to return to\r\ncaptivity so to avoid death: he prays to the Virgin, and a lion is sent,\r\nwho guards and guides him on his darksome solitary way. To rouse still\r\nmore the compassion of the audience, there is one scene where the public\r\ncrier comes on to sell a mother and father, and two children: the elder\r\none has a sense of his situation and of the trials he is to expect with\r\nfirmness; the younger knows nothing beyond his fear at being tern from\r\nhis mother's side. A merchant buys the younger, and bids him come with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Juan._ I cannot leave my mother, sir, to go\r\nWith others.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Go, my child--ah! mine no more,\r\nBut his who buys thee.\r\n\r\n_Juan._ Mother dear, dost thou\r\nDesert me?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Heaven! How pitiless thou art!\r\n\r\n_Merchant._ Come, child, come!\r\n\r\n_Juan._ Brother, let's go together.\r\n\r\n_Francisco._ It is not in my choice--may heaven go with\r\nthee!\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Remember, oh, my treasure and my joy,\r\nThy God!\r\n\r\n_Juan._ Where do they take me without you,\r\nMy father!--my dear mother!\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Sir, permit\r\nFor one brief moment that I speak to my\r\nPoor child--short will the satisfaction be,\r\nLong, endless sorrow following close behind.\r\n\r\n_Merchant._ Say what thou wilt; 'tis the last time thou canst.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Alas! it is the first that e'er I felt\r\nSuch woe.\r\n\r\n_Juan._ Mother, keep me with thee;\r\nSuffer me not to go, I know not where.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Fortune has, since I bore thee, my sweet child,\r\nHidden her face--the heavens are dark--the sea\r\nAnd the wild winds combine for my dismay;\r\nThe very elements our enemies!\r\nThou knowest not thy misery, although\r\nThou art its victim--and such ignorance\r\nIs happiness for thee! My only love,\r\nSince to see thee no more I am allow'd,\r\nI pray thee never to forget to seek\r\nThe favour of the Virgin in thy prayers--\r\nThe queen of goodness she--of grace and hope\r\nShe can unloose thy chain, and set thee free.\r\n\r\n_Aydar._ Hark to the Christian what advice she gives!\r\nThoud'st have him lost as thee, false infidel!\r\n\r\n_Juan._ My mother, let me stay--let not these Moors\r\nTake me away.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ My treasures go with thee.\r\n\r\n_Juan._ In faith, I fear these men!\r\n\r\n_Mother._ But I more fear\r\nThou wilt forget thy God, me and thyself,\r\nWhen thou art gone: thy tender years are such,\r\nThat thou wilt lose thy faith amidst this race\r\nOf infidels--teachers of lies.\r\n\r\n_Crier._ Silence!\r\nAnd fear, old wicked woman, that thy head\r\nPay for thy tongue!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the play, Juan is seduced by fine clothes and sweetmeats\r\nto become a Mahometan. When we think of the Spanish horror of renegades,\r\nand its fierce punishment, we may imagine the effect that such scenes,\r\nbrought vividly before them, must have had. The play ends with the\r\narrival of a vessel, with a friar on board, charged with money to redeem\r\nthe captives, and the universal joy the Christians feel; Cervantes had\r\nfelt such himself, and well could paint it. The whole play, though\r\nwithout plot, and rendered wild and strange by the introduction of\r\nallegorical personages, yet is full of the interest of pathetic\r\nsituations and natural feelings, simply, but vividly represented; such\r\ndoubtless, roused every sentiment of horror and compassion, and even\r\nvengeance in a Spanish audience. In some respects we feel otherwise; and\r\nwhen one of the captives relates the cruel death of a priest burnt by\r\nslow fire, by the Moors, in retaliation of a Moor burnt by the\r\ninquisition, our indignation is rather levelled against that nefarious\r\ninstitution, which, unprovoked, punished those who adhered to the faith\r\nof their fathers, and filled the whole world with abhorrence for its\r\nname. Such, Cervantes could not feel; and in reading his works, and\r\nthose of all his countrymen, nothing jars with our feelings so much as\r\nthe praise ever given to the most savage cruelties of the Dominicans,\r\nand the merciless reprobation expressed towards those who dared revenge\r\ntheir wrongs.\r\n\r\nFrom the publication of these works to \"Don Quixote,\" what a gap! He\r\nwould seem to have lived as an unlighted candle--suddenly, a spark\r\ntouches the wick, and it burst into a flame. \"Don Quixote\" is perfect in\r\nall its parts. The first conception is admirable. The idea of the crazed\r\nold gentleman who nourished himself in the perusal of romances till he\r\nwanted to be the hero of one, is true to the very bare truth of nature,\r\nand how has he followed it out? Don Quixote is as courageous, noble,\r\nprincely, and virtuous as the greatest of the men whom he imitates: had\r\nhe attempted the career of knight errantry, and afterwards shrunk from\r\nthe consequent hardships, he had been a crazy man, and no more; but\r\nmeeting all and bearing all with courage and equanimity, he really\r\nbecomes the hero he desired to be. Any one suffering from calamities\r\nwould gladly have recourse to him for help, assured of his resolution\r\nand disinterestedness, and thus Cervantes shows the excellence and\r\nperfection of his genius. The second part is conceived in a different\r\nspirit from the first; and to relish it as it deserves, we must enter\r\ninto the circumstances connected with it. Cervantes was desirous of not\r\nrepeating himself. There is less extravagance, less of actual insanity\r\non the part of the hero. He no longer mistakes an inn for a castle, nor\r\na flock of sheep for an army. He sees things as they are, although he is\r\nequally expert in giving them a colouring suited to his madness. This,\r\nhowever, renders the second part less entertaining to the general\r\nreader, less original, less brilliant; but it is more philosophic, more\r\nfull of the author himself: it shows the deep sagacity of Cervantes, and\r\nhis perfect knowledge of the human heart. Its drawback, for the second\r\npart is not as perfect as the first, consists in the unworthy tricks of\r\nthe duchess--very different from the benevolent disguise of the princess\r\nMicomicona, the deceptions of this great lady are at once vulgar and\r\ncruel.\r\n\r\nThe greatest men have looked on \"Don Quixote\" as the best book that ever\r\nwas written. Godwin said, \"At twenty, I thought 'Don Quixote'\r\nlaughable--at forty, I thought it clever--now, near sixty, I look upon\r\nit as the most admirable book in the whole world.\" In Coleridge's\r\n\"Literary Remains,\" there are some admirable remarks on \"Don Quixote;\"\r\nthey are too long to be inserted here, but I cannot refrain from quoting\r\nthe contrast he draws between the Don and Sancho Panza. He says, \"Don\r\nQuixote grows at length to be a man out of his wits; his understanding\r\nis deranged; and hence, without the least deviation from the truth of\r\nnature, without losing the least trait of personal individuality, he\r\nbecomes a substantial living allegory, or personification of the reason\r\nand moral sense divested of the judgment and understanding. Sancho is\r\nthe converse. He is the common sense without reason or imagination; and\r\nCervantes not only shows the excellence and power of reason in Don\r\nQuixote, but in both him and Sancho the mischiefs resulting from a\r\nseverance of the two main constituents of sound intellectual and moral\r\naction. Put him and his master together, and they form a perfect\r\nintellect; but they are separated and without cement: and hence, each\r\nhaving need of the other for its whole completeness, each has at times a\r\nmastery over the other; for the common sense, though it may see the\r\npractical inapplicability of the dictates of the imagination of abstract\r\nreason, yet cannot help submitting to them. These two characters possess\r\nthe world--alternately and interchangeably the cheater and the cheated.\r\nTo impersonate them, and to combine the permanent with the individual,\r\nis one of the highest creations of genius, and has been achieved by\r\nCervantes and Shakspeare almost alone.\"\r\n\r\nOf the \"Novellas,\" or tales of Cervantes, I had intended to give a\r\ndetail, but have no space; they are among the best of his works. They\r\ncannot compete with the best of Boccaccio: they have not his energy of\r\npassion--his soul-melting tenderness--his tragic power and matchless\r\ngrace; but the tales of Cervantes are full of interest and amusement:\r\nthey possess the merit also of being perfectly moral; he calls them\r\nhimself Novellas Exemplares, and there is not a word that need be\r\nslurred over or omitted. It is strange also that as afterwards the\r\nintrigue of his comedies was so bad, that of some of his stories is\r\nso good, that Beaumont and Fletcher--than whom no dramatists better\r\nunderstood the art of fabricating plays--have adopted two, (\"La Señora\r\nCornelia\" and \"Las Dos Doncellas\"), and so adopted them as to follow\r\nthem line for line, and scene by scene. There is a very beautiful\r\ninterview in \"Las Dos Doncellas,\" between a cavalier and a lady at\r\nnight, by the sea-shore; Beaumont and Fletcher have but translated and\r\nversified this, and it stands among the most effective of their\r\nscenes.[72]\r\n\r\nThe \"Voyage to Parnassus\" has the inherent Spanish defect of length,\r\notherwise it has great merit: the ridicule is playful--the machinery\r\npoetic--the story well adapted for burlesque. There had been a poem,\r\nwritten on the subject of a voyage to Parnassus, by Cezare Caporali--an\r\nItalian of Perugia. Cervantes begins his poem by mentioning the return\r\nof the Italian, and how he, who ever desired to deserve the name of\r\npoet, resolved to follow his example. In playful derision of his\r\npoverty, he describes his departure: a piece of bread and a cheese in\r\nhis wallet, were all his provision--\"light to carry, and useful for the\r\nvoyage and then he bids adieu to his lowly roof--\"Adieu to Madrid--adieu\r\nto its fountains, which distil ambrosia and nectar--to its prado--to its\r\nsociety--to the abodes of pleasure and deceit.\" He arrives at\r\nCarthagena, and sees Mercury, who invites him to embark on board a boat,\r\nand to come to assist in the defence of Parnassus, which had been\r\nattacked by a host of poetasters. The skiff is fancifully described:--\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd lo! of verses framed, the bark,[73]\r\nFrom the maintop to water mark,\r\nWithout a word of prose betwixt;\r\nThe upper decks were glosses mix'd--\r\nA hodge-podge badly put together,\r\nIll-married all with one another:--\r\nAnd of romances form'd, the crew,\r\nA daring people glad to do\r\nThe wildest acts, however fierce.\r\nThe poop was made of other verse:\r\n'Twas form'd of sonnets, each one rare,\r\nWritten all with the nicest care.\r\nTwo tercets, bold as muse could write,\r\nThe gunnels framed from left to right,\r\nAnd gave free scope unto the oar.\r\nThe gangway's length was measured o'er\r\nBy elegies most sad and long,\r\nMore apt for tears than gladsome song.\r\nThe mast that rose unto the sky\r\nAn ode embodied, long and dry,\r\nTarr'd o'er with songs of dreary length,\r\nSo to ensure its weight and strength.\r\nAnd all the yards that ran across\r\nWere burthens harsh--you're at no loss\r\nTheir hard material to find:\r\nThe parrel creaking to the wind,\r\nOf redondillas gay and free;\r\nSo that more easy it might be.\r\nThe ropes and tackle--rigging all--\r\nOf seguidillas light and small,\r\nEach twined with fancies gay and fickle,\r\nThe which the soul are apt to tickle;\r\nThe thwarts, of stanzas staunch and strong,\r\nPlanks to support a world of song;\r\nWhile the pennants, flying lightly,\r\nLove songs framed so gay and sprightly.\r\nSestinas grave, and blank verse ready,\r\nShaped the keel both sharp and steady;\r\nThat like a duck the bark might swim,\r\nAnd o'er the waters lightly skim.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbarked on board this fanciful galley. Mercury shows him a long\r\ncatalogue of poets, asking his advice as to their admission. Cervantes\r\ntakes this occasion to characterise several of his contemporary poets,\r\nin a manner that in his day might have been keenly satirical or warmly\r\nlaudatory: there is no doubt that there is a good deal of irony in his\r\npraise, but a portion also is sincere. The whole is obscure and\r\nuninteresting to us. In the midst of the examination, a crowd of poets\r\nrush into the skiff, in numbers that threaten its safety; and the syrens\r\nare obliged to raise a storm to scatter them. After this, he beholds a\r\ncloud obscure the day, and from this cloud falls down a shower of poets,\r\nand, among them, Lope de Vega, \"a renowned poet, whom none excels, or\r\neven equals, in prose or verse.\" The voyage now proceeds prosperously;\r\nthe vessel glides along impelled by oars formed of verses druccioli,\r\n(such as have a dactyl at the end of each line), and the sails, which\r\nare stretched to the height of the mast, were\r\n\r\n\r\nWoven of many a gentle thought,\r\nUpon a woof that love had wrought,\r\nFill'd by the soft and amorous wind\r\nWhich breathed upon us from behind--\r\nEager to waft us swift along;\r\nWhile the fair queens of ocean-song--\r\nThe syrens three, around us float,\r\nAnd so impel the dancing boat;\r\nAnd crested waves are spread around,\r\nSnowy flocks on a verdant ground;\r\nAnd the crew are at work reciting,\r\nOr sweet love-laden sonnets writing,\r\nOr singing soft the sweetest lays\r\nAll in their gentle ladies' praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey, at last, arrive at Parnassus; and then follows a description of\r\nthe gardens of the Hesperides: arrived before Apollo, he invites them to\r\nsit down; on this, all the seats around are speedily occupied, and\r\nCervantes remains standing. He then gives an account to Apollo of his\r\nwritings, in which he praises himself modestly enough, and, after\r\nalluding to his poverty, sums up all, by saying, \"that he is contented\r\nwith little, though he desires much, and that his chief annoyance is to\r\nfind himself standing there, when all others sit.\" Apollo answers him\r\ncomplimentarily, and bids him double up his cloak, and sit on that; but\r\npoor Cervantes has no cloak. \"Well,\" replies Apollo, \"even thus I am\r\nglad to see you; virtue is a mantle with which penury can hide and cover\r\nits nakedness, and thus avoid envy.\" \"I bowed my head to this advice,\r\nand remained standing; for it is wealth or favour alone that can\r\nfabricate a seat.\" Poetry herself now appears, and her description is\r\nthe most poetic passage Cervantes ever wrote. The arts and sciences\r\nhovered round her, and, in serving her, were themselves served; since\r\nthus all nations held them in higher veneration. All things he\r\nrepresents as bringing tribute to Poetry:--the rivers, their currents;\r\nthe ocean, its changeful tides, and secret depths; herbs present their\r\nvirtues to her; trees, their fruits and flowers; and stones the power\r\nthey hold within; holy love presents her with its chaste delights; soft\r\npeace her happy rest; fierce war, her achievements. The wise and\r\nbeautiful lady knew all, disposed of all, and filled all things with\r\nadmiration and pleasure. There is real poetry in this description,\r\nmelody in the verse, and truth and beauty in the imagery. But we get\r\nweary; for page succeeds to page, and the poem never ends. A second\r\nstorm ensues. Neptune endeavours to submerge and destroy the poetasters;\r\nbut Venus prevents them from sinking, by turning them into empty gourds\r\nand leathern bottles, which swim about in a thousand different manners.\r\nA battle, at last, ensues between the real and would-be poets; while\r\nCervantes, full of annoyance, hurries away, seeking out his old and\r\ndusky dwelling, and throws himself wearied upon his bed.\r\n\r\nThere is a whimsical postscript to the \"Voyage to Parnassus,\" written in\r\nprose, and very amusing. It recounts the visit of a would-be poet, who\r\nbrings Cervantes a letter from Apollo. The god reproaches him for having\r\ngone away from Parnassus without having taken leave of him and his\r\ndaughters, and says the only excuse he can admit is his hurry to visit\r\nhis Mecænas, the great count of Lemos at Naples: another token that\r\nCervantes was disappointed in not receiving an invitation.\r\n\r\nThe last of Cervantes's works, the one he was occupied upon up to the\r\nhour cf his death, was \"Persiles and Sigismunda,\"--a romance, full of\r\nwild adventures, of love and war, of danger, escape, and indeed every\r\nvariety of accident of \"flood and field.\" It shows the true bent of the\r\nauthor's mind, who delighted to revel, like his own Don Quixote, in the\r\nvery excesses of the imagination; and showing thus, how in his advanced\r\nage, he had forgotten none of his youthful tastes. He wrote it in\r\nimitation of Heliodorus: it is amusing in parts, and in parts\r\ninteresting; but now that the taste for this heterogeneous, though\r\nimaginative, species of writing has passed away it will scarcely find\r\nreaders sufficiently persevering, and sufficiently fond of the fabulous\r\nand strange, to dwell upon its enchainment of impossible adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Viardôt]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: This circumstance is mentioned by M. Viardôt only; and\r\nwas unknown to every other biographer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Viardôt.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Viardôt.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Bouterwek says, erroneously, that Los Rios has interwoven\r\nCervantes's novel of the \"Captive\" into his biography, as being\r\nauthentic, and relating to himself. This is a mistake: Los Rios\r\nconceives, indeed, that the mention made by the captive of \"a soldier,\r\nby name Saavedra,\" alludes to Cervantes himself, who adopted that\r\nsurname, as of course he does; but the history he gives of his captivity\r\nis drawn from other sources, such as are used, with some additions, for\r\nthe present narrative.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Topographia y Historia general de Argel, repartido en\r\ncinco tratados, do se veran casos estranos, muertas espantoas, y\r\ntormentas exquisitas, que conviene se entiendan en la christianidad: con\r\nmucha doctrina y elegancia curiosa.

The first runs thus:--\r\n\r\n\"In the said city of Madrid, on the 31st of July, of the year 1579, in\r\nthe presence of me, the notary, and the underwritten witnesses, the said\r\nfathers, friar Juan Gil and friar Antonio de la Vella, received 300\r\nducats, at eleven rials each ducat, being 230 ducats, from the hand of\r\ndonna Leonora de Cortinas, widow, formerly wife of Rodrigo de Cervantes,\r\nand fifty ducats from donna Andrea de Cervantes, inhabitants of Alcalà,\r\nnow in this court (_this expression is always used to signify Madrid_),\r\nto contribute to the ransom of Miguel de Cervantes, an inhabitant of the\r\nsaid city, son and brother of the above named, who is captive at Algiers\r\nin the power of Ali Mami, captain of the vessels of the fleet of the\r\nking of Algiers, who is thirty-three years of age, has lost his left\r\nhand; and from them they received two obligations and receipts, and\r\nreceived the said sum before me, the notary, being witnesses, Juan de\r\nQuadros and Juan de la Peña Corredor, and Juan Fernandez, residing in\r\nthis court: in faith of which the said witnesses, friars, and I, the\r\nsaid notary, sign our names.\"\r\n\r\nThe second register is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In the city of Algiers, on the 19th of September, 1580, in presence of\r\nme, the said notary, the rev. father friar Juan Gil, the above named\r\nredeemer, ransomed Miguel de Cervantes, a native of Alcalà de Henares,\r\naged thirty-three, son of Rodrigo de Cervantes and of donna Leonora de\r\nCortinas, and an inhabitant of Madrid; of a middle size, much beard,\r\nmaimed of the left arm and hand, taken captive in the galley el Sol,\r\nbound from Naples to Spain, where he had been a long time in the service\r\nof H. M. He was taken 26th September, 1575, being in the power of Hassan\r\nPacha, king: his ransom cost 500 crowns of gold in Spanish gold;\r\nbecause, if not, he was to be sent to Constantinople; and, therefore, on\r\naccount of this necessity, and that this Christian should not be lost in\r\na Moorish country, 220 crowns were raised among the traders and the\r\nremaining 250 collected from the charities of the redemption. Three\r\nhundred ducats were given in aid; and they were assisted by the charity\r\nof Francisco de Caramanchel, of whom is the patron the very illustrious\r\nSeñor Domingo de Cardenas Zapata, of the council of H. M., with fifty\r\ndoubloons, and by the general charity of the order they were assisted by\r\nfifty more; and the remainder of the sum, the said order engaged to\r\nrepay, being money belonging to other captives, who gave pledges in\r\nSpain for their ransom; and, net being at present in Algiers, they are\r\nnot ransomed; and the said order are under obligation to return the\r\nmoney to the parties, the captives not being ransomed; and besides were\r\ngiven nine doubloons to the officers of the galley of the said king\r\nHassan Pacha, who asked it as their fees: in faith of which sign their\r\nnames, &c.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: It is usually said, and Viardôt repeats it, that\r\nCervantes was driven from his theatrical labours by the success of Lope\r\nde Vega. This is not the fact. Lope sailed with the Invincible Armada,\r\nand it was not until his return that he began his dramatic career. The\r\nfact seems simply to have been that Cervantes, feeling the animation of\r\ngenius within him, yet not having discovered its proper expression, was,\r\nto a certain degree, successful as a dramatist, though he could not\r\noriginate a style which should give new life to the modern drama: thus\r\nhis gains were moderate, and he found himself unable to support those\r\ndependant on him. The place of commissary offered itself to rescue him\r\nfrom this state of poverty. Afterwards, when Lope began his career,\r\nCervantes found indeed, that, he filled the public eye, and had hit its\r\ntaste; and that his dramas, with their jéjune plots and uninterwoven\r\nincidents, however, adorned by poetry and the majesty of passion, were\r\nthrown aside and forgotten.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: This monument excited attention in the capital--Lope de\r\nVega in his comedy of \"La Esclava de su Galan,\" \"The slave of her Lover\"\r\nmakes a lady living in great retirement in this country, say, \"I visited\r\nSeville but twice: once to see the king, whom heaven guard! and a second\r\ntime to see the wondrous edifice of the monument; so that I was only to\r\nbe tempted out by the grandest objects which heaven or earth contains.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: \"AL TUMULO DEL REY EN SEVILLA.\r\n\r\n'Voto á Dios que me espanta esta grandeza,\r\ny que diera un doblon por describilla,\r\nporque ¿ á quien no suspende y maravilla\r\nesta maquina insigne, esta braveza?\r\nPor Jesu Christo vivo, cada pieza\r\nvale mas que un millon, que es mancilla\r\nque esto no duré un siglo.--O gran Sevilla;\r\nRoma triunfante en animo y riqueza.\r\nApostare que el anima del muerto,\r\npor gozar esto sitio, hoy ha dexado\r\nel Cielo de que goza eternamente!'\r\nEsto oyo un valenton, y dixo: 'Es cierto\r\nlo que dice voace, seor soldado,\r\ny quien dixere lo contrario miente.'\r\nY luego en continente\r\ncaló el chapeo, requirio la espada,\r\nmiro al soslayo, fuese, y no hubo nada.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Los Rios--Pruebas de la Vida.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: \"When I was at Valladolid, a letter was brought to my\r\nhouse which cost a rial. It contained a bad, silly discourteous sonnet,\r\nwithout wit or point, speaking ill of 'Don Quixote,'--so that I grudged\r\nthe rial infinitely.\"--_Postcript to the \"Voyage to Parnassus._\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Torres Marquez, master of the pages to the archbishop of\r\nToledo, was a friend of Cervantes, and took every occasion to proclaim\r\nhis genius and worth. It was through him, probably, that the archbishop\r\nbestowed a pension on him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: The Argensolas were men much esteemed in their day, and\r\nare so often mentioned by Cervantes and Lope de Vega, that they must not\r\nbe passed over in silence. But as there is nothing very original in\r\ntheir writings, we shall take the liberty of dismissing them in a note.\r\nThe elder, Lupercio, the historiographer for Aragon, secretary to the\r\nempress Maria of Austria, and secretary of state to the count of Lemos\r\nwhen viceroy of Naples, died in that city in 1613, at the age of\r\nforty-eight. He founded an academy at Naples, and was a studious and\r\nlaborious man. He burned a considerable portion of his poems just before\r\nhis death, as not worthy to survive him. Bartolomé was an ecclesiastic.\r\nHe followed his brother to Naples. On his death he quitted Italy. He\r\ncontinued the \"Annals of Aragon,\" and wrote a history of the conquest of\r\nthe Molucca islands; a work written with judgment and elegance. His\r\nsecular poetry is so similar to his brother's that they cannot be\r\ndistinguished one from the other. Following the same school, adopting\r\nthe same tastes, and neither of them original, it is not surprising that\r\ntheir productions bore a close resemblance. The best works, however, of\r\nBartolomé are his sacred Canzoni. He died at Saragossa, in the year\r\n1531, at the age of sixty-five.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Coleridge's summary of the character and life of\r\nCervantes, though not correct in letter, is admirable in spirit: \"A\r\nCastilian of refined manners; a gentleman true to religion, and true to\r\nhonour. A scholar and a soldier; he fought under the banners of don John\r\nof Austria, at Lopanto, and lost his arm, and was captured. Endured\r\nslavery, not only with fortitude, but with mirth; and, by the\r\nsuperiority of nature, mastered and overawed his barbarian owner.\r\nFinally ransomed, he resumed his native destiny--the awful task of\r\nachieving fame; and for that reason died poor, and a prisoner, while\r\nnobles and kings, over their goblets of gold, gave relish to their\r\npleasures by the charms of his divine genius. He was the inventor of\r\nnovels for the Spaniards; and in his \"Persiles and Sigismunda\" the\r\nEnglish may find the germ of their \"Robinson Crusoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world was a drama to him. His own thoughts, in spite of poverty and\r\nsickness, perpetuated for him the feelings of youth. He painted only\r\nwhat he knew, and had looked into; but he knew, and had looked into much\r\nindeed; and his imagination was ever at hand to adapt and modify the\r\nworld of his experience. Of delicious love he fabled, yet with stainless\r\nvirtue.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Quarterly Review, vol. XXV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: There is an excellent translation of ten from among them;\r\nwe may also mention that there is an admirable old English translation\r\nof Don Quixote, by Shelton.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: \"De la quilla á la gavia, ó estraña cosa!\r\ntoda de versos era fabricada,\r\nsin que se entremiese alguna prosa.\r\nLas ballesteras eran de ensalada\r\nde glosas, todas hechas á la boda,\r\nde la que se llamó Malmaridada:\r\nera la chusma de romances toda\r\ngente atrevida, empero necesaria\r\npues á todas acciones se acomoda.\r\nLa popa de materia extraordinaria,\r\nbastarda, y de legitimos sonetos,\r\nde labor peregrina en todo y varia.\r\nEran dos valentisimos tercetos\r\nlos espaldares de la izquierda y diestra,\r\npara dar boga larga muy perfetos.\r\nHecha ser la cruxia se me muestra\r\nde una luenga y tristisima elegia,\r\nque no en cantar, sino en llorar es diestra.\r\nPor esta entiendo yo que se diria\r\nlo que suele, decirse á un desdichado,\r\nquando lo pasa mal, pasó cruxia.\r\nEl árbol hasta el cielo levantado\r\nde una dura cancion prolixa estaba\r\nde canto de seis dedos embreado.\r\nEl y la entena que por el cruxaba\r\nde duros estrambotes--la madera\r\nde que eran hechos claro se mostraba.\r\nLa racamenta, que es siempre parlera,\r\nToda la componian de redondillas,\r\nCon que ella se mostraba mas ligera,\r\nlas xarcias parecian seguidillas,\r\nde disparates mil y mas compuestas\r\nQue suelen en el alma hacer cosquillas.\r\nlas rumbadas, fortisimas y honestas\r\nestancias, eran tablas ponderosas,\r\nque llevan un poema y otro á cuestas.\r\nEra cosa de ver las bulliciosas\r\nvanderillas que a ayre tremolaban,\r\nDe varias rimas algo licenciosas.\r\nLos grumetes, que aqui y alli cruxaban\r\nde encadenados versos parecian,\r\npuesto que como libres trabajaban,\r\ntodas las obras muertas componian\r\nO versos sueltos, ó sextinas graves\r\nque la galera mas gallarda hacian.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOPE DE VEGA\r\n\r\n1562-1635.\r\n\r\nThere is a vulgar English proverb of such a one being born with a silver\r\nspoon in his mouth. We are reminded of it when we compare the several\r\ncareers of Cervantes and Lope de Vega. If we judged without inquiry, we\r\nshould imagine no man more likely to obtain popularity through his\r\nworks, than the author of \"Don Quixote.\" His disposition was cheerful\r\nand unrepining; to the last hour of his life he displayed lightness of\r\nheart, even to the censure of a dull envious rival (Figueroa), who\r\nremarks, that such was his weakness, that he wrote prefaces and\r\ndedications even on his death bed,--prefaces, as we have shown, full of\r\nanimation and wit. Yet he lived in penury, died obscurely, and went to\r\nhis grave unhonoured, except by his friends; while all Madrid flocked to\r\ndo honour to the funeral of Lope; and two volumes of eulogiums and\r\nepitaphs form but a select portion of all that was written to\r\ncommemorate his death. It is true that posterity has been more just:\r\ngreat pains have been taken to give forth correct editions of\r\nCervantes's works, and to ascertain the events of his life; while the\r\ntwenty-one volumes of Lope's \"Obras Sueltas\" are full of errors, and his\r\nplays are only to be obtained in single pamphlets, badly printed, both\r\nto sight and sense.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to read the epithets of praise heaped on this favourite of\r\nhis age, during his life and immediately on his death. His friend and\r\ndisciple Montalvan adopts a phraseology very similar to that in use with\r\nthe emperor of China, when he is styled \"Brother of the sun\" and \"Uncle\r\nof the stars.\" He with all the pomp of Spanish hyperbole, names him \"the\r\nportent of the world; the glory of the land; the light of his country;\r\nthe oracle of language; the centre of fame; the object of envy; the\r\ndarling of fortune; the phoenix of ages: prince of poetry; Orpheus of\r\nsciences; Apollo of the muses; Horace of poets; Virgil of epics; Homer\r\nof heroics; Pindar of lyrics; the Sophocles of tragedy; and the Terence\r\nof comedy. Single among the excellent, and excellent among the great:\r\ngreat in every way and in every manner.\" Such was the usual style of\r\nspeaking of Lope,--his common appellation being the phoenix of Spain.\r\nAnd now, while editions of \"Don Quixote\" are multiplied, and each hour\r\nadds to the fame of Cervantes, we inquire concerning Lope, principally\r\nfor the sake of discovering the cause of the excessive admiration with\r\nwhich he was regarded in his own time. The life written by Montalvan,\r\nthe biography compiled with such care and elegance by Lord Holland, and\r\nvarious researches given to light in several numbers of the \"Quarterly\r\nReview,\" (written we believe, by Mr. Southey), are (in addition to the\r\nworks of Lope himself) our principal guides in tracing the following\r\npages.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega Carpio was born at Madrid[74], in the house of Geronimo de\r\nSoto, near the gate of Guadalaxara, on the 26th of November, 1562, on\r\nthe day of St. Lope, bishop of Verona, and was baptized on the 6th of\r\nDecember following, in the parish church of San Miguel de les Octeos.\r\nHis parents were in the same situation as these of Cervantes--hidalgos,\r\nbut poor. We have an account of Felix de Vega, father of the poet, which\r\nshows him to have been a good and pious man, and a careful father. He\r\nwas very attentive to his religious duties, and had rooms in the\r\nHospital de la Corte, whither his children accompanied him, and they\r\nperformed several menial offices, and washed the feet of the\r\npoor--comforting and helping the convalescent with clothes and money.\r\nThe good example thus implanted imparted a charitable and pious turn to\r\nLope's life,--and still more to that of his elder sister, Isabel de\r\nCarpio, who was singularly pious, and died in 1601.[75] Felix de Vega\r\nwas also a poet, as his son informs us in the \"Laurel de Apolo,\" in some\r\nverses of respectful and graceful allusion[76]; so that he added the\r\ninheritance of a poetical temperament to his pious instructions.\r\n\r\nThe boy early displayed great tokens of talent. What we are told of him\r\ndoes not exceed the accounts given of other young prodigies, and we are\r\nwilling to believe the relations handed down of this wonderful child,\r\nwho, whatever his other merits were, showed himself to the end of his\r\nlife the prince of words, having written more than any other man ever\r\ndid, and we may believe, therefore, that he acquired the art of using\r\nthem earlier than others. At two years old he was remarkable for the\r\nvivacity of his eyes, and the drollness of his ways, showing even thus\r\nearly, tokens of his after career; he was eager even then to learn; and\r\nknew his letters before he could speak, repeating his lessons by signs\r\nbefore he could utter the words. At five years old he read Spanish and\r\nLatin--and such was his passion for verses, that before he could use a\r\npen he bribed his elder schoolfellows with a portion of his breakfast,\r\nto write to his dictation, and then exchanged his effusions with others\r\nfor prints and hymns. Thus truly he lisped in numbers; as he says of\r\nhimself in the epistle before referred to, \"I could scarcely speak when\r\nI used a pen to give wings to my verses and is another proof, (if proof\r\nwere wanting that the sun shines at noon day) of innate talent. At\r\ntwelve he was master of rhetoric and grammar, and of Latin composition,\r\nboth in prose and verse. To the latter accomplishment we must put the\r\nlimit, that probably he was as learned as his masters; and that was not\r\nmuch, for the Latin verses he published in later life are excelled by\r\nany clever Etonian of the fourth form. In addition to these classical\r\nattainments, he had learned to dance, and fence, and sing.\r\n\r\nHe was left early an orphan, and his vivacious disposition led him into\r\nvarious scrapes and adventures. The most important among these was an\r\nelopement from school when fourteen years of age, impelled by a desire\r\nof seeing the world. He concerted with a friend of his, Fernando Muñoz,\r\nwho was filled with a similar desire: they both provided as well as they\r\ncould for the necessities of the journey, and went on foot as far as\r\nSegovia, where they bought a mule for 15 ducats; with this they\r\nproceeded to Lavañeza, and Astorga--where meeting, we may guess, with\r\nseveral of those various discomforts we find detailed in \"Lazarillo\r\nde los Tormes,\" and other _picaresco_ works, as inevitable in Spanish\r\ninns, they became disgusted, and made up their minds to return. When\r\nthey had got back as far as Segovia, their purses were emptied of small\r\nmoney, and they had recourse to a silversmith, the one to sell a chain\r\nand the other to change a doubloon. The silversmith's suspicions were\r\nawakened and he sent for a judge, and the judge, a miracle in Spain, was\r\na just judge, as Montalvan says, \"he must have had a touch of conscience\r\nabout him\"--for he neither robbed nor threw them into prison; but\r\nquestioning them and finding them agree in their story, and that their\r\nfault was that of youth, not of vice, he sent them back to Madrid, with\r\nan alguazil, who restored them, doubloons, chain and all, into the hands\r\nof their relations, \"which,\" says Montalvan, \"he did at small cost. Such\r\nthen was the honesty of the ministers of justice, who now-a-days would\r\nhave thought they had not gained enough had they not made an eight-days'\r\nlawsuit about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth soon after became an inmate in the house of the grand\r\ninquisitor, don Geronimo Manrique, bishop of Avila; it would appear that\r\nhe was there as a _protegé_, and that the bishop thought his talents\r\ndeserving protection and encouragement. His own expression is, \"Don\r\nGeronimo Manrique educated me.\" He delighted the prelate with various\r\neclogues that he wrote, and a comedy called the \"Pastoral of\r\nJacinto,\"--from which Montalvan dates the change Lope de Vega operated\r\nin the Spanish theatre. This comedy is not extant, therefore it is\r\nimpossible to pass a judgment upon it; but the name of pastoral rather\r\nseems to limit it to an imitation of the plays then in vogue; indeed his\r\neulogist only mentions this difference, that he had reduced the number\r\nof acts to three. Montalvan goes on to speak as if he, at this time,\r\nbrought out successful plays, but this arises rather from the confusion\r\nof his expressions, than mistake: he wrote them, it is true, for he\r\ntells us so himself; but there is no trace of any being played.\r\nMeanwhile, feeling that his knowledge was slight, and his education\r\nunfinished, with the assistance of the bishop, he entered the university\r\nof Alcala, where he remained four years, until he graduated, and was\r\ndistinguished among his companions in the examinations.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the university of Alcala, he entered the service of the duke\r\nof Alva[77], who became attached to him, and made him not only his\r\nsecretary but his favourite. A doubt is raised as to which duke this is;\r\nwhether it be the oppressor of the Low Countries, or his successor:\r\nchronology seems to determine that it was the former. It has already\r\nbeen mentioned in this work, that the duke of Alva,--whose name in the\r\nNetherlands, and with us, is stamped with all the infamy that\r\nremorseless cruelty, blind bigotry, and faithlessness bestows--was\r\nregarded in Spain as the hero of the age. Lope introduces the mention of\r\na statue in the \"Arcadia,\" and says, \"This last, whose grey head is\r\nadorned by the ever verdant leaves of the ungrateful Daphne, merited by\r\nso many victories, is the immortal soldier, don Fernando de Toledo, duke\r\nof Alva, so justly worthy of that fame, which you behold lifting herself\r\nto heaven from the plumes of the helmet, with the trump of gold, through\r\nwhich for ever she will proclaim his exploits, and spread his name from\r\nthe Spanish Tagus to the African Mutazend; from the Neapolitan Sabeto to\r\nthe French Garonne. He is a Pompilius in religion; a Radamanthus in\r\nseverity; Belisarius in guerdon; Anaxagoras in constancy; Periander in\r\nwedlock; Pomponius in veracity; Alexander Severus in justice; Regulus in\r\nfidelity; Cato in modesty; and finally a Timotheus in the felicity which\r\nattended all his wars.\"\r\n\r\nAt the request of the duke of Alva he wrote his \"Arcadia.\" It has been\r\nmentioned how the imitations of Sannazaro's pastoral had become the\r\nfashion in Spain. The \"Diana\" of Montemayor, its continuation by Gil\r\nPolo, and the \"Galatea\" of Cervantes, were all read with enthusiasm.\r\nWhat the charm of this composition is, we can scarcely guess; yet we\r\nfeel it ourselves when we read the \"'Arcadia\" of sir Philip Sidney. The\r\nsort of purely sentimental life of the shepherds and shepherdesses, with\r\ntheir flocks, pipes, and faithful dogs, appears to shut out the baser\r\nportion of existence, and to enable us to live only for the\r\naffections,--a state of being, however impracticable, always alluring;\r\nand when to this is added the delightful climate of Spain, which\r\ninvested pastoral life with all the loveliness and amenity of nature, we\r\nare the less surprised at the prevalence of the taste. Lope was very\r\nyoung when he entered the lists, and wrote his \"Arcadia.\" There is\r\nexaggeration in its style, and in its sentiments; yet no one can open it\r\nwithout becoming aware of the talent of the author. The poetry with\r\nwhich it is interspersed possesses the peculiar merit of\r\nLope--perspicuity, and an easy artless flow in its ideas; as for\r\ninstance, the cancion imitated from the ancients, beginning,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O libertad preciosa\r\nNo comparada al oro.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story is meagre, and inartificial to a singular degree. But we\r\nfollow an example set us, of giving some slight detail of it, for the\r\nsake of introducing a coincidence of a singular nature.[78] Anfrisio and\r\nBelisarda are lovers; Anfrisio is of so high descent that he believes\r\nJupiter to be his grandfather; but Belisarda is designed by her parents\r\nto be the bride of the rich, ignorant, and unworthy Salicio. Anfrisio is\r\nforced to remove to a distant part of the country; but by a fortunate\r\ncircumstance, thither also Belisarda is brought by her father, and the\r\nlovers meet and enjoy each other's society till scandal begins to busy\r\nherself with them, and, at the request of his mistress, Anfrisio sets\r\nout for Italy, so to baffle the evil thoughts of the malicious. He loses\r\nhis way during his wanderings, and comes to a cavern, wherein resides\r\nDardanio, a magician, who promises to grant him any wish he may express,\r\nhowever impossible. Anfrisio, with a moderation astonishing to our more\r\ngrasping minds, asks only to see the object on whom he has placed his\r\naffections. He beholds her in conversation with a rival, whom, in pure\r\npity, she presents with a black ribbon; which sight transports Anfrisio\r\nwith jealousy, and he meditates revenging her perfidy by putting her to\r\ndeath; but Dardanio carries him off in a whirlwind. Soon after he\r\nreturns home, and to annoy Belisarda, pretends to be in love with the\r\nshepherdess Anarda; while she in revenge openly favours Olimpio. They\r\nare both very miserable; and still more so when driven to desperation,\r\nBelisarda marries Salicio. Soon after, an explanation ensues between her\r\nand Anfrisio, but it is too late. Anfrisio's sole resource is to forget;\r\nand by means of the sage Polinesia, through a visit to the Liberal Arts,\r\nand an acquaintance with the lady Grammar and the young ladies Logic,\r\nRhetoric, Arithmetic, and Geometry, and others not less\r\nagreeable--Perspective, Music, Astrology, and Poetry--he arrives at the\r\ntemple of Disengaño, or Dis-illusion; where things are seen as they\r\nare, the passions cease to influence, the imagination to deceive, and\r\nthe lovelorn shepherd becomes a rational man.\r\n\r\nThe composition of this story has given rise to a singular conjecture.\r\nWhen Montemayor wrote \"Diana,\" and Gil Polo continued it, and Cervantes\r\ncomposed \"the robe in which the lovely Galatea appeared to the eyes of\r\nmen,\" it is known that they embodied their own passions and sorrows in\r\nthe pastoral personages they brought on the scene; but Lope is not the\r\nhero of his tale. Anfrisio is supposed to represent the duke of Alva\r\nhimself--the tyrant, the destroyer--who, it would seem, requested his\r\nyoung _protegé_ to immortalise his early loves in the manner other\r\npoets had done their own. A good deal of testimony is brought in support\r\nof this hypothesis.[79] In the commendatory verses prefixed to the\r\n\"Arcadia\" there is a sonnet from Anfrisio to Lope de Vega, which\r\naddresses him by the name of Belardo, under which he personified himself\r\nin the pastoral; and which shows by its context that it was written by a\r\nman of consequence, and a protector of the poet. \"Belardo,\" he says, \"it\r\nhas proved fortunate for my loves, that you came to my estate and became\r\none of my shepherds; for now neither time nor oblivion will cover them.\r\nYou have dwelt upon my sorrows, yet not to the full; since they are\r\ngreater than you have described, though the cause wherefore I suffered\r\nlessened them. Tagus and my renowned Tormes listen to you. They call the\r\nshepherd of Anfrisio, Apollo. If I am Anfrisio, you are my Apollo!\" The\r\npainter Francisco Pacheco, in the eulogy that accompanies his portrait\r\nof Lope, speaking of the \"Arcadia,\" says that the poet \"had succeeded in\r\nwhat he designed, which was to record a real history to the pleasure of\r\nthe parties.\"\r\n\r\nMontalvan hints at the same thing, when he says that Lope wrote this\r\nwork at the command of the duke, and calls it a \"mysterious enigma of\r\nelevated subjects, concealed in the disguise of humble shepherds.\" And\r\nLope himself says, \"The 'Arcadia' is a true story;\" and again, in the\r\nprologue to the work itself, he insists several times on the fact that\r\nhe describes the sorrows of another, not his own. He assumes the name of\r\nBelardo for himself, but introduces himself only as a Spanish shepherd,\r\npoor and pursued by adversity. At the conclusion he comes forward as\r\nBelardo, addressing his pipe, and taking leave of the tale on which he\r\nwas occupied. In this he talks of leaving the banks of the Manzanares\r\n(the river of Madrid), and seeking a new master and a new life. \"What is\r\nbetter,\" he says, \"when one has lost a blessing, than to fly from the\r\nspot where one enjoyed it, so not to see it in the possession of\r\nanother? My fortunes are dubious; but what evil can befall him who has\r\nonce known happiness? I lost that which was mine, more from not being\r\nworthy of it, than from not knowing its value; but I console myself with\r\nthe expectation of fresh disasters.\"[80]\r\n\r\nAs the \"Arcadia\" was written in early life, but not published till 1598,\r\nit is impossible to say to what particular period of his career or to\r\nwhat misfortunes the above alludes.\r\n\r\nIt were a subject for a painter to portray the old grey-headed duke--the\r\npersecutor of heroes, the slayer of the innocent, but retaining\r\nthroughout a satisfied conscience, and the dignity of virtue--pouring\r\nhis love-tale in the young Lope's ear, or listening with delight while\r\nLope read to him the tale of his early love, clothed in the fantastic\r\ncostume of a pastoral and the ideal imagery of poetry.\r\n\r\nLord Holland has given a specimen of the poetry of the \"Arcadia\" in his\r\nlife; but we refer to his pages, and will only conclude by mentioning\r\nthat, despite the conceits, the false taste, and exaggeration, there is\r\nmuch genius, much real poetry, simplicity, and truth—lines full of\r\nsweetness and grace, and a lucidness of expression, which reminds the\r\nreader of Metastasio, who was indeed a lover of Spanish verse, and who\r\nhas never been surpassed in the crystal clearness of his expressions,\r\nand the chiseled perfection (so to express ourselves) with which he\r\nrepresents his ideas.\r\n\r\nThe \"Arcadia,\" though written thus early, was not published, as has\r\nbeen mentioned, till 1598; and it is conjectured that the death of its\r\nhero, the duke of Alva, was the cause of the delay. But it may be added,\r\nthat Lope wrote a great deal but published nothing before that period,\r\nwhen, his plays having made him popular, he printed most of his early\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nHe left the service of the duke of Alva, when he married a lady of rank,\r\ndonna Isabel de Urbino, daughter of don Diego de Urbino, king-at-arms.\r\nThe marriage took place to the satisfaction of the friends of both\r\nparties; and the lady is praised as beautiful and discreet. He did not\r\nhowever, long enjoy his domestic happiness. \"It happened,\" says\r\nMontalvan, \"that there was a sort of half-and-half hidalgo[81] (for\r\nthere is a twilight in the origin of nobility as well as in the break of\r\nday) of small fortune, but of great skill in contriving to dress and eat\r\nas well as the rest of the world, without other employment than\r\nfrequenting society, when with little trouble to himself he lived\r\ncheaply by flattering those present and back-biting the absent. Lope\r\nheard that on one occasion he had entertained a company at his expense.\r\nHe passed over the impertinence, not from fear, but contempt; but seeing\r\nthat the man persisted in his attacks, he grew tired; so without\r\nquarrelling with him by sword or word--the first being impious, the\r\nsecond foolish--he depicted him in a song so pleasantly, that every body\r\nlaughed.\" The would-be wit grew angry--none being more easily offended\r\nthan those who take licence to offend--and he challenged Lope. They met;\r\nand the cavalier was dangerously wounded. This was the immediate cause\r\nthat obliged Lope to quit Madrid; though Montalvan mentions other\r\nscrapes which he had got into in his youth, and which his enemies took\r\nthis occasion to bring against him. He left wife and home with a heavy\r\nheart, and took up his residence in Valencia, where he was treated with\r\ndistinction and kindness.\r\n\r\nHe remained at Valencia for some years, and doubtless wrote a great\r\ndeal, though at that time he published nothing. He formed a friendship\r\nthere with Vicente Mariner, himself a voluminous poet, whose\r\ncompositions remain inedited in the king of Spain's libraries. Among\r\nthese are many to the honour and memory of Lope, and in fierce attack of\r\nhis enemies--so fierce that they deserve the name of abuse, and show\r\nthat the Spanish cavalier could descend, as so many literary men have\r\nbefore, to calling names, as argument.[82]\r\n\r\nAfter a few years, Lope returned to Madrid; and such was his joy in\r\nrevisiting the scenes of his youth, and being reunited to his wife, that\r\neven his health was affected by it. He did not, however, long enjoy this\r\nnewfound happiness: his wife died shortly after his return. The death of\r\nthis lady was celebrated in an eclogue, written conjointly by Lope and\r\nMedina Medinilla. The strophes, composed by Lope, are full of the\r\ntenderest grief and impatient despair, but there is not a word relative\r\nto their separation; he exclaims at Death for having divided them, and\r\nimplores her to take him to where she is--to where they might live for\r\never secure together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1588.\r\nÆtat.\r\n26.]\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after he became a soldier, and joined the\r\nInvincible Armada.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this apparent freak are differently represented. Montalvan\r\nattributes it chiefly to his grief on losing his wife. In the eclogue to\r\nClaudio, which Lope writes with the avowed intention of recording the\r\nevents of his early life, but in which he mentions no adventures\r\nanterior to this period, he speaks of being banished from Filis, and\r\nthat he sought relief from his tender sorrows by changing climate and\r\nelement; and Mars coming to his aid, he marched to Lisbon with the\r\nCastilian troops, with a musket on his shoulder, and tore up for\r\ncartridges the verses he had written in his mistress's praise. In\r\nseveral of his sonnets also he gives the same reason for his military\r\ncareer.[83]\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion of the present day to ransack every hidden corner of a\r\nman's life, and to bring to light all the errors and follies which he\r\nhimself would have wished to consign to oblivion. A writer offers a\r\nfairer mark than any other for these inquiries, as we can always fancy\r\nat least that we trace something of the man himself in his works, and so\r\nform a tissue of some sort from these patchwork materials; Lope felt\r\nthis, and in one of his epistles, laments that by publishing his verses,\r\nhe has perpetuated the memory of his follies. \"My love-verses,\" he says,\r\n\"were the tender error of my youth; would I could cover them in\r\noblivion! Those poets do well who write in enigmas, since they are not\r\ninjured by the hidden.\" We do not know that we should have enlarged on\r\nthis portion of his life, but for some conjectures given in the article\r\nbefore quoted in the eighteenth volume of the \"Quarterly Review.\" The\r\nauthor of that article, in mentioning Lope's second marriage, says,\r\n\"Lope speaks of this marriage as a happy one; yet among the sonnets\r\nthere are two which may excite a suspicion that his heart was placed on\r\nanother object. The inference from the first of these poems is, that he\r\ndid not love the woman whom he married; and from the second that he had\r\nformed a miserable attachment to the wife of another man. This last\r\ninference will be much strengthened if there be any reason for supposing\r\nthat he shadowed out his own character in the 'Dorotea;' one of the most\r\nsingular, and, unless such a supposition be admitted, the most\r\nunaccountable of all his works.\"\r\n\r\nTaking it for granted that these sonnets and the 'Dorotea' refer to\r\nhimself, we think there is every proof to show that they allude to his\r\nearly life, his first marriage, and all those subsequent disasters, to\r\nfly from which he embarked on board the Armada. Certainly great\r\nobscurity hangs over the period of his first marriage, and the causes of\r\nhis long exile at Valencia. His antagonist in the duel was a man of no\r\nconsequence, and merely wounded; so, although that duel might have\r\noccasioned him to fly, it would not have forced so protracted an\r\nabsence. He does not allude to any of these circumstances in his eclogue\r\nto Claudio. In his epistle to doctor Gregorio de Angulo he seems to\r\nimply that being married, he loved another woman, or that he was not\r\nhappy in his first marriage.[84] Montalvan, in speaking of his flight to\r\nValencia, mentions, in addition to the duel, youthful scrapes, which his\r\nenemies took that opportunity of bringing against him.[85] In a funeral\r\neulogium, written on Lope by don Joseph Pellicer, there are these\r\nexpressions:--\"The excellent qualities of Lope excited the animosity of\r\nseveral powerful enemies, who forced him several times to become a\r\nwanderer. His pen was his faithful companion in his disasters and exile,\r\nand secured him shelter and welcome in distant provinces.\"[86]\r\n\r\nPutting all these circumstances and hints together, it is plain that\r\nLope suffered a good deal of adversity at this time. His illustrious\r\npatron, the duke of Alva, died soon after his marriage. When the duel\r\nand other circumstances caused him to fly, he had no powerful friend to\r\nassist him, but was driven to absent himself even for years. During so\r\nlong a separation from home, and being only about four-and-twenty at\r\nthis period, it is not impossible nor strange that he should have formed\r\nan unfortunate attachment.\r\n\r\nThe sonnets Mr. Southey mentions, and which he translates, are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Seven long and tedious years did Jacob serve,\r\nAnd short had been the term if it had found\r\nIts end desired. To Leah he was bound,\r\nAnd must by service of seven more deserve\r\nHis Rachael.--Thus will strangers lightly swerve\r\nFrom their pledged word. Yet Time might well repay\r\nHope's growing debt, and Patience might be crowned,\r\nAnd the slow season of expectance passed,\r\nTrue Love with ample recompense at last,\r\nRequite the sorrows of this hard delay.\r\nAlas for me--to whose unhappy doom,\r\nNo such blest end appears! Ill fate is his,\r\nWho hopes for Rachael in the world to come,\r\nAnd chained to Leah drags his life in this.\"[87]\r\n\r\n\"When snows before the genial breath of spring\r\nDissolve--and our great Mother reassumes\r\nHer robe of green; the meadow breathes perfumes,\r\nLoud sings the thrush, the birds are on the wing,\r\nThe fresh grass grows, the young lambs feed at will.\r\nBut not to thee, my heart, doth nature bring\r\nThe joy that this sweet season should instil:\r\nThou broodest alway on thy cherished ill.\r\nAbsence is no sore grief--it is a glass,\r\nWherein true love from falsehood may be known;\r\nWell may the pain be borne which hath an end;\r\nBut woe to him whose ill-placed hopes attend\r\nAnother's life, and who till that shall pass\r\nIn hopeless expectation wastes his own.\"[88]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese sonnets are two among many, all addressed to a lady whom he calls\r\nLucinda. Generally speaking, they treat only of her cruelty and his\r\nsufferings: there is no date given to certify at what period they were\r\nwritten; but they were published in 1604, during the life of his second\r\nwife--with whom there is every proof that he lived in harmony, and he\r\nwould never have pained her by publishing his desire for her death. This\r\ncircumstance renders it conclusive that they referred to the passions of\r\nhis youth.\r\n\r\nThe \"Dorotea\" is indeed a singular performance, and we have read it with\r\nsome care to discover what it contains that gives the idea that he\r\nshadowed forth himself. And we will give some account of the work, which\r\ndiffuse and tedious, will hardly attract the reader, but which at least\r\npresents a vivid picture of Spanish manners, and if relating to Lope\r\nhimself, must be regarded with increased interest. We must premise that\r\nthough this work was one of the last that he published, and that he\r\nmentions it as the favourite his of old age[89], yet that it was written\r\nat Valencia in his youth.[90]\r\n\r\n\"Dorotea\" is not a play; it is a story told in dialogue, a sort of\r\ncomposition which has lately been named \"Dramatic Scenes.\" It is in\r\nprose, with a few poems interspersed. It is, as usual, very diffuse, and\r\neven incoherent and obscure in parts, and contains the story of the\r\nintrigues of a young man, whom it has been conjectured Lope intended for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nDon Fernando, the hero of the piece, says of himself that his parents\r\ndying, and leaving him in poverty, he went to the Indies to try his\r\nfortune, but not prospering he returned to Madrid, where he was\r\nhospitably received by a rich relation. This lady had in her house a\r\ndaughter and a niece; with the niece, named Marfisa, Fernando fell, in\r\nsome sort, in love. Unfortunately she was obliged to marry a gentleman\r\nof some rank and merit, but aged. The lovers parted with tears; but the\r\nmarriage was of short duration, the husband dying soon after. Meanwhile\r\nFernando, on the very day of Marfisa's wedding, was introduced to\r\nDorothea. He was then, he tells us, two-and-twenty, Dorothea fifteen,\r\nand beautiful beyond description. They seemed formed for each other, and\r\nthough they now met for the first time, yet they felt as if they had\r\nknown one another for years.\r\n\r\nDorothea was already married, but her husband was far away in India. She\r\nwas courted by a foreign prince, whom she coquetted with, giving him\r\nlarge hopes, and slight favours. This powerful rival Fernando at length\r\ngets rid of: but he suffers from another evil, the evil of poverty; and\r\nthe thoughts engendered by want of money fill him with melancholy.\r\nDorothea observes his sadness, and he confesses its cause; she promises\r\nat once to give up all feasts and amusements, and sends to his house her\r\njewels and plate in two coffers. He disposes of these, and even so draws\r\non his mistress's resources, that she is obliged to deny herself fitting\r\ndress, and to betake herself to unaccustomed labour for her maintenance.\r\n\r\nThis lasted for five years; and the piece begins at this period, when an\r\nofficious neighbour, Gerarda (who is set on by don Belia, a creole, who\r\nis another and a rich admirer of Dorothea) attacks Theodora, the mother\r\nof Dorothea, on the scandal the neighbours promulgate with regard to her\r\ndaughter's life. Theodora is alarmed, and commands Dorothea to see\r\nFernando no more. She, in despair, hurries (accompanied by her maid) to\r\nhis house, to impart the sad intelligence. Fernando takes it very\r\ncoolly, and dismisses her in a manner to make her believe that he no\r\nlonger loves. But when she is gone, he falls into a transport of\r\ndespair; and partly piqued at her daring to think of obeying her mother,\r\nand partly too miserable to stay longer in a town where he may no longer\r\nbehold her, he resolves to quit Madrid, and go to Seville. Being in want\r\nof means, he applies to his old friend Marfisa; and trumping up a story\r\nof having killed a man, and being obliged to fly (which, he says, is\r\ntrue, since he himself was dead, and at the same time obliged to absent\r\nhimself), Marfisa gives him \"the gold she possessed, and the pearls of\r\nher tears;\" and thus enriched, Fernando departs for Seville.\r\n\r\nDorothea remains: she talks of her lover, and her hard fate, with her\r\nmaid Celia. Among other things, Celia says, \"The scandal that arose was\r\ngreatly occasioned by Fernando writing verses in his lady's praise.\"\r\nDorothea replies, \"What greater riches can a woman possess, than to have\r\nherself immortalised? Her beauty fades, but the verses written in her\r\nhonour are eternal witnesses of it. The Diana of Montemayor was a lady\r\nof Valencia; and the river Ezla and herself are immortalised by his pen.\r\nAnd the same has happened to the Philida of Montalvo, the Galatea of\r\nCervantes, the Camila of Garcilaso, the Violante of Camoens, the Silvia\r\nof Bernaldes, the Philis of Figueroa, and the Leonora of Corte-real.\"\r\nBut though Dorothea loves Fernando, and is grateful for his verses, she\r\nproves false, and admits to her favour his rich rival, don Belia.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fernando, unable to endure his absence from her, returns. They\r\nmeet by accident, and Dorothea feels all her affection revive. She\r\nexclaims on the cruelty of her mother, and the misery of her fate, and\r\nthen intimates her falsehood. \"All were against me,\" she says; \"my\r\nmother with ill usage, Gerarda with flattery, you by leaving me, and a\r\ncavalier by persuading me.\" However, notwithstanding this, they are for\r\na time in some sort reconciled. But Fernando becomes cold and uneasy;\r\nassured that Dorothea loves him, he grows indifferent; certain of her\r\nfalsehood, he is annoyed: he fancies that his honour is injured in the\r\neyes of the world by his toleration, and he resolves to break with her.\r\nHe sees in Marfisa the love of his early years. \"We had been brought up\r\ntogether,\" he says; \"but although it is true that she was the object of\r\nmy first attachment in the early season of my youth, her unlucky\r\nmarriage, and the beauty of Dorothea, caused me to forget her charms as\r\nmuch as if I had never seen them. She returned home after the untimely\r\ndeath of her husband; and she regarded me with eyes of favour, but I\r\nvainly tried to admire her: yet I resolved to cultivate my attachment\r\nfor her without giving up Dorothea. She (Dorothea) perceived a change,\r\nbut attributed it to my honour being offended by the pretensions of don\r\nBelia; and in this she was right, since for that cause I had resolved to\r\nhate her. She indeed would have been willing to love me alone, but that\r\nwas impossible--her fortunes forbade it.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an unlucky encounter with his rival, to whom he is forced to\r\ngive way, rouses him to revenge against Dorothea; and fate puts the\r\noccasion in his hands. By mistake he sends her a letter from Marfisa to\r\nhimself; a violent quarrel ensues; and they part to meet no more. A\r\nfriend of Fernando prophesies to him the sequel of these disasters; he\r\ntells him that he will be persecuted by Dorothea and her mother, and\r\nthrown into prison, but afterwards liberated and banished; before this\r\nhe will have become attached to a young lady, whom he will marry to the\r\ndiscontent of the relations on both sides. She will accompany him in his\r\nbanishment with great constancy and love, but will die. He will then\r\nreturn to Madrid, Dorothea being then a widow, and will wish to marry\r\nhim, but his honour has more influence over him than her riches, and he\r\nwill refuse her. He will afterwards be very unfortunate in love, but by\r\nhelp of prayer will extricate himself, and enter another state of life.\r\nMarfisa will again marry a literary man, who will leave the kingdom with\r\nan honourable employment, but she will soon again be a widow, and then\r\nmarrying a Spanish soldier, she will be very unhappy, and at last be\r\nassassinated by her husband in a fit of jealousy. Fernando is astonished\r\nat these prophecies, and announces his intention of joining the\r\nInvincible Armada. Dorothea, on her side, is teaching herself no longer\r\nto love him; she breaks his portrait, and burns his letters. But while\r\nshe is looking forward to happiness with don Belia, he is killed in a\r\nduel. She rushes out in despair, and Gerarda falls into a well, and is\r\ndrowned. \"And thus ends Dorothea,\" says the author, \"the rest being only\r\nthe misfortunes of Fernando; the poet could not fail in the truth, for\r\nthe story is true. Look at the example, for which end it is written.\"\r\n\r\nAll this strange medley of a story is told in dialogue, much of which is\r\nspirited and natural, but much, very much, pedantic, and beyond\r\nexpression tedious. By some means, despite her misconduct, we are\r\ninterested in Dorothea; she is so frank, so beautiful, so generous;\r\nwhile Fernando is, on the contrary, an object of contempt. He takes the\r\nmoney of Dorothea, and then angry at the first mention she makes of her\r\nmother's interference, he flies from her rather in revenge than in\r\ngrief: throughout he is selfish and ungenerous.\r\n\r\nWhether Lope shadowed forth himself is very doubtful. There is a sort of\r\ndwelling upon trifles, and a reality in the situations, that makes the\r\nwhole look as if it were founded on fact; yet the facts do not accord\r\nwith the circumstances known of his life. If it be himself that he\r\nportrays, it is himself at two or three and twenty, in the first\r\ninexperienced dawn of life, in all the heyday of the passions, when love\r\nwas life, and moral considerations and the softer affections still\r\nlingered far behind in the background. To this period he often alludes\r\nin his epistles, when he mentions the troubled sea of love in which he\r\nwas lost before his second marriage; from which period he dates his\r\npeace and felicity. And all this together proves to us that his\r\nallusions to an unfortunate attachment have no reference to that happier\r\ntime. We deduce also from this various evidence that his taking up the\r\nlife of a soldier, and joining the Armada, arose from his desire to fly\r\nfrom the adversity he had fallen into, \"to change clime and element,\" to\r\nbegin a new career, in the hope of becoming a new man. Montalvan\r\nstrengthens this view, when he says that this enterprise was undertaken\r\nin a fit of desperation, when he was desirous of finishing life and its\r\nsorrows at the same time; and thus driven by adversity, he enlisted\r\nunder the banners of the duke of Medina Sidonia. Leaving Madrid, he\r\ntraversed Spain to Cadiz, and thence repaired to Lisbon, where he\r\nembarked with a brother, who was an alferez de marina, a title probably\r\nanswering to our midshipman, unless it be that he was ensign in a marine\r\ncorps. Lope was a simple volunteer.[91]\r\n\r\nIt is well known with what sanguine expectations of glorious victory the\r\nInvincible Armada sailed. The privateering or piratical expeditions of\r\nDrake and Hawkins though in accordance with the manners of the times,\r\nand, indeed, disgracefully imitated in late years, had excited feelings\r\nfull of burning animosity and fierce vengeance in the hearts of the\r\nSpaniards. Added to these natural feelings, was the odium of English\r\nheresy, which, deep rooted and rankling in Philip II.'s heart, was\r\nparticipated in by his subjects; they considered the expedition of the\r\nArmada as holy, as well as patriotic. Lope felt the full force of these\r\nsentiments; he bade the invincible fleet go forth and burn the world;\r\nwind would not be wanting to the sails, nor fire to the artillery, for\r\nhis breast, he said, would supply the one, and his sorrow the other.\r\nSuch was his ardour and such his sighs.\r\n\r\nTwelve of the largest vessels, according to the favourite Spanish\r\ncustom, were named after the twelve apostles. Lope's brother had a\r\ncommission in the galleon San Juan, and he embarked on board the same\r\nvessel. In accordance with the crusading spirit of the expedition, all\r\npersons sailing in it were called upon to be duly shriven, and receive\r\nthe sacrament with humility and repentance; and the general order went\r\non to forbid all blasphemy against God, our Lady, and the saints; all\r\ngambling, all quarrels, all duels. Lope felt the enthusiasm of such an\r\nhour, and of such a character: a soldier of God going to relieve many\r\ncontrite spirits oppressed by heretics,--a patriot about to avenge the\r\ndisasters brought on his country by her enemies.\r\n\r\nLope gives an animated description of the setting forth of the\r\nArmada,--its drums and clarions, its gay pendants, the ploughing up of\r\nthe waves by the keels, and the gathering together of the busy\r\ncrews.[92] Of himself, he says that Aristotle slept, with matter, forms,\r\ncauses, and accidents; but he was not idle; and in another work, he\r\nmentions that in this expedition, in which, for a few years, he followed\r\nthe career of arms, \"my inclination prompted me to use my pen, and the\r\ngeneral finished his enterprise when I did mine; for there, on the\r\nwaters upon the deck of the San Juan, beneath the banners of the\r\nCatholic king, I wrote, 'The Beauty of Angelica.'\" Thus, amidst storms\r\nand disasters, when his brother died in his arms, struck by a ball in a\r\nskirmish with the Dutch at the very commencement of the expedition;\r\nwhile the ships around them were a prey to winds, and waves, and the\r\nenemy; and the fury of the violent tempests spread destruction around,\r\nLope wrapped himself in his imagination, and beguiled his sorrows and\r\nanxieties by the pleasures of composition. \"The Beauty of Angelica\" is a\r\ncontinuation of Ariosto's poem. The Italian leaves the heroine on her\r\nroad to Cathay, and Lope brings them to Spain. His tale is unconnected.\r\nCarried away by Spanish diffuseness, he frames neither plot nor story,\r\nbut rambles on as his fancy leads. It opens with the marriage of Lido, a\r\nking of Andalusia with Clorinarda, a daughter of the king of Fez, who,\r\nmeanwhile, loves Cardiloro, a son of Mandricardo and Doralice; a pair\r\nfamiliar to all the readers of Ariosto. The unhappy bride dies of grief,\r\nand her husband follows her to the tomb, leaving his kingdom to the most\r\nbeautiful, be that either man or woman. The judges sit in judgment, and\r\ngive their stupid opinions, on which Lope exclaims--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O dotards! through your spectacles who pry,\r\nAnd ask the measure of a lovely face;\r\nMeasure the influence of a woman's eye,\r\nAnd ye may then I ween compute the space;\r\nThat intervenes between the earth and sky.\"[93]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany candidates arrive,--the old and ugly and decrepit, leaving their\r\nhomes, and braving every danger,--to claim the reward of beauty. Among\r\nthem, but surpassing all in charms, Angelica and Medoro appear. Angelica\r\nis described with the greatest minuteness,--brow, eyes, nose, ears, and\r\nteeth are all depicted. But more beautiful than this sort of Mosaic\r\nportraiture are the verses that portray her companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Scarce twenty years had seen the lovely boy,\r\nAs ringlet locks and yellow down proclaim;\r\nFair was his height, and grave to gazers seemed\r\nThose eyes, which where they turned with love and softness beamed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe judges decide in favour of Angelica, and she and her husband are\r\ncrowned. But their beauty gives rise to many a passion in the bosoms of\r\nothers; and various are the incidents, brought about by enchantments and\r\nother means, which for a time disunite the beautiful pair, who, at last,\r\ndiscover their mistakes, and the poem ends with their happiness. This\r\nwork possesses little merit, except here and there in short passages;\r\nbut it is a singular specimen of Lope's power of composition, amidst\r\ncircumstances so foreign to the subject in hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1590.\r\nÆtat.\r\n28.]\r\n\r\nOn his return from the Armada, he quitted the career of arms, and\r\nentered the service, first, of the marquis de Malpica, and soon after of\r\nthe count of Lemos, leaving him only on occasion of his second marriage\r\nto donna Juana de Guardio, a lady of Madrid, of whom he thus speaks:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Who could have thought that I should find a wife,\r\nWhen from that war I reached my native shore,\r\nSweet for the love which ruled her life,\r\nDear for the sorrows which she bore?\r\nSuch love which could endure through cold and hot,\r\nCould only have been mine or Jacob's lot.\"[94]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sorrows to which Lope alludes, we conjecture to have arisen from\r\nstraitened means. He brought out a vast quantity of plays at this time,\r\nand received no scanty remuneration; still he was not risen to the\r\nzenith of his fame, when on every side he received donations and\r\npensions. He was extravagant we know, and prodigality might easily\r\nproduce a gap between his expenses and his chance receipts as an author.\r\nThis view is strengthened by his dedication of his play \"El Verdadero\r\nAmante,\" The True Lover, to his little son Carlos. This was not\r\npublished till 1620, but must have been written long previous, as Carlos\r\ndied before (how long, we know not) 1609, and is dedicated to him _while\r\nhe was learning the rudiments of the Latin language._ He bids him follow\r\nhis studies without impeding them with poetry, because he who had\r\naddicted himself to it was ill rewarded. He continues--\"I possess only,\r\nas you know, a poor house, with table and establishment in proportion,\r\nand a small garden, whose flowers divert my cares and inspire me with\r\nideas. I have written 900 plays, and twelve volumes on various subjects\r\nin prose and verse, so that the printed will never equal in quantity the\r\nunprinted; and I have acquired enemies, critics, quarrels, envy,\r\nreprehension, and cares; having lost precious time, and arrived nearly\r\nat old age without leaving you any thing but this useless advice.\"\r\nNotwithstanding this repining. Lord Holland is probably right in\r\nsupposing that the years of Lope's second marriage were the happiest of\r\nhis life, though, perhaps, he felt at the commencement some pecuniary\r\nembarrassments. Through life he was extravagant, and on first setting\r\nout as an author might easily be in debt; yet, as he rose in fame his\r\nfortunes mended, and affection and content enshrined the family circle.\r\n\r\nThe period of his domestic happiness did not last long. At six years\r\nold, his little son died; his wife soon followed her child to the tomb,\r\nand Lope was left with two daughters.[95] From his own pen we give an\r\naccount of his wedded happiness, and his grief when his home again\r\nbecame desolate. In the Eclogue to Claudio, he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I saw a group my board surround,\r\nAnd sure to me, though poorly spread,\r\n'T was rich with such fair objects crowned--\r\nDear bitter presents of my bed!\r\nI saw them pay their tribute to the tomb,\r\nAnd scenes so cheerful change to mourning and to gloom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to this affecting picture, he makes frequent mention of\r\nthese circumstances in his epistles, and we subjoin extracts, which we\r\nare sure must interest the reader.\r\n\r\nOne of these epistles is addressed to doctor Mathias de Porras, who had\r\nbeen appointed corregidor of the province of Canta in Peru. These\r\nepistles are in verse; but as their length is great, the abstract made\r\nfrom them might as well be in prose:--\r\n\r\nSince you left me, Señor Doctor, and without dying went to the other\r\nworld, I have passed my life in melancholy solitude; the evils of my lot\r\nincreasing in proportion to the blessings of which you saw me deprived.\r\nDid not my new office (of priest) give me breath, the prop of my years\r\nwould fall to the ground. O vain hopes! How strange are the roads that\r\nlife passes through, as each day we acquire new delusions!\" He then goes\r\non to speak of his early loves and sorrows, and of the power of beauty,\r\nand continues, \"But the vicissitudes of a life of passion were then\r\nover, and my heart was liberated from its importuning annoyances, when\r\neach morning I saw the dear and sincere face of my sweet wife at my\r\nside, and when Carlos--his cheeks all lilies and roses--won my soul by\r\nhis charming prattle. The boy gambolled about me as a young lamb in a\r\nmeadow at the morning hour. The half-formed words of his little tongue\r\nwere sentences for us, interpreted by our kisses. I gave thanks to\r\nEternal Wisdom, and content with such mornings after such dark nights, I\r\nsometimes wept my vain hopes, and believed myself secure--not of\r\nlife--but of reserving this felicity. I then went to write a few lines,\r\nhaving consulted my books. They called me to eat, but I often bade them\r\nleave me, such was the attraction of study. Then bright as flowers and\r\npearls, Carlos entered to call me, and gave light to my eyes and\r\nembraces to my heart. Sometimes he took me by the hand, and drew me to\r\nthe table beside his mother. There, doctor, without pomp, an honest and\r\nliberal mediocrity gave us sufficing sustenance. But fierce Death\r\ndeprived me of this ease, this cure, this hope. I lived no longer to\r\nbehold that dear society which I imagined mine for ever. Then I disposed\r\nmy mind for the priesthood, that asylum might shelter and guard me.\r\nThe Muses were idle for a time, and I refrained from all things worldly,\r\nand humbly attained the sacred stole.\"\r\n\r\nAnother epistle is written under the feigned name of Belardo, the\r\nappellation he had assumed in his \"Arcadia,\" to Amaryllis.[96] In this\r\nhe gives a sketch of portions of his life. He speaks of his early turn\r\nfor poetry and his predilection for study, and continues:--\"Love, and\r\nlove ever speaks false, bade me incline to follow him. What then befell\r\nme I now feel; but as I loved a beauty never to be mine, I had recourse\r\nto study, and thus the poet destroyed the love that destroyed him.\r\nFavoured by my stars, I learned several languages, and enriched my own\r\nby the knowledge I gained through them. Twice I married; from which you\r\nmay gather that I was happy--for no one tries twice a painful thing. I\r\nhad a son whom my soul lived in. You will know by my elegy that this\r\nlight of my eyes was called Carlos. Six times did the sun retrocede,\r\nequalling day and night, counting thus the time of his birth, when this\r\nmy sun lost its light. Then expired life that was the life of Jacinta.\r\nHow much better it had been that I had died, than that Carlos in his\r\nvery morning should encounter so long a night! Lope remained, if it be\r\nLope who now lives. Marcella at fifteen obliged me to offer her to God,\r\nalthough, and you may believe me, though a father's love might be\r\nsupposed blind, she was neither foolish nor ugly. Feliciana showed me in\r\nher words and eyes the image of her lost mother, who died in giving her\r\nbirth. Her virtues enforce tears, and time does not cure my sorrow. I\r\nleft the gaieties of secular life; I was ordained. Such is my life; and\r\nmy desires aspire to a good end only, without extravagant pretensions.\"\r\n\r\nIn his epistle to don Francisco de Herrera he enlarges on the vocation\r\nof Marcella. \"Marcella,\" he says, \"the first care of my heart, thought\r\nof marrying, and one evening she spoke freely to me of her betrothed. I,\r\nseeing that it was prudent to examine her wish, since accident might\r\nhave swayed it, grew attentive; at the same time that I desired to avoid\r\nshaking her intention if it were founded in the truth of her heart. But\r\nher anxiety increasing each day, I resolved to give her the husband to\r\nwhom she aspired with so much love.\" He then explains the Son of God to\r\nbe her bridegroom--vows of chastity her nuptial benediction. He\r\ndescribes the whole ceremony of her taking the veil. The marchioness de\r\nla Tela was her godmother; the duke of Sesa and many other nobles being\r\npresent. Hortensio preached the sermon. \"She asked me,\" he says, \"leave\r\nto conclude the marriage, and she whom I had loved, and whose lovely\r\nperson I had adorned more like a lover than a father, in gold and\r\nsilk--like a rose that fades and falls to pieces at the close of day,\r\nlosing the pomp of her crimson leaves--now sleeps upon rough straw, and\r\nbarefoot and ill clad sits at a poor table.\"\r\n\r\nThe dates of the various events of Lope's life are very uncertain, and\r\nnone more so than that of his second marriage. He mentions it as\r\nhappening soon after his return from the expedition to England. Yet he\r\nspeaks of taking orders soon after his wife's death, and he took orders\r\n1609. The term of his second marriage, however, endured only for eight\r\nyears. It would therefore appear that several years elapsed after his\r\nreturn to Madrid before he married a second time. As diligent a\r\nresearcher as M. Viardôt in old parish books and official documents,\r\nwould clear up this obscurity. As it is, we can only give the facts, as\r\nwe find them stated, obscurely.\r\n\r\nThe effect of his bereaved condition was, as has been mentioned, to\r\ninduce him to take vows, and be ordained. He prepared himself, by\r\nretiring from gay society, assumed a priestly dress, served in\r\nhospitals, and performed many acts of charity; and finally, visiting\r\nToledo, took orders, and said his first mass in a Carmelite church. He\r\nentered a fraternity of priests dedicated to the performance of good\r\nworks and the assistance of the poor, and fulfilled his duties\r\nzealously, so that he became named head chaplain, and was as generous as\r\nconscientious in the exercise of his office. To his other sacred\r\nemployments he added that of being a familiar of the inquisition. His\r\npiety, which was catholic and excessive, led to this; but it is a\r\npainful circumstance, in our times especially, when we are told that he\r\npresided over the procession of the confraternity of familiars of the\r\nholy office, on the occasion of an _auto da fé_, when a relapsed\r\nLutheran was burned alive. We feel sure that Cervantes would never have\r\nbeen led to a similar act.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his reputation as an author was rising to that height which it\r\nafterwards reached. In 1598, the canonisation of St. Isidro, a native of\r\nMadrid, was the occasion of prizes being given to the authors of verses\r\nwritten in his honour. Each style of poetry gained its reward, but above\r\none could not be gained by the same person. Lope succeeded in the hymns;\r\nbut he had tried in all. He wrote a poem of ten cantos in short verse,\r\nnumberless sonnets and ballads, and two comedies. These were published\r\nunder the feigned name of Tomé de Burguillos, and are among the best of\r\nLope's compositions. Already his dramas were in vogue, and the public\r\nwere astonished by their number and excellence. In this year also he\r\npublished the \"Arcadia,\" written long before. Afterwards he published\r\nothers of his younger productions; for it is singular that he printed\r\nnothing while a very young man, and that he had established his\r\nreputation by his plays before he deluged the world with his lyric and\r\nepic poetry. The \"Hermosura de Angelica\" did not see light till 1604;\r\nand thus was it with many other of his productions, which he wrote\r\nprobably at Valencia during his exile, and which when he found profit by\r\nso doing, he bestowed on the public.\r\n\r\nThe reputation he attained awakened the enmity of rivals and critics.\r\nWhen Cervantes published \"Don Quixote,\" in 1605, Lope was risen high in\r\npopular estimation; he was generally applauded--almost adored. The\r\nabundance and facility of his verses, and the amiableness of his\r\ncharacter, were in part the occasion of this; but the eminent cause was\r\nhis theatre, which we delay considering, not too much to interrupt the\r\nthread of his history, but whose originality, novelty, vivacity, and\r\nadaptation to the Spanish taste, secured unparalleled success. Cervantes\r\ndid not feel the merits of his innovations, and he considered himself\r\nalso the unacknowledged originator of many of the improvements\r\nattributed to Lope. We have seen in what Cervantes's dramatic\r\npretensions consisted--high wrought and impassioned scenes connected,\r\nnot by the intricacies of a methodical plot, but by the simple texture\r\nof their causes and effects, such as we find in life itself. He felt\r\nthat he had written well; he was unwilling to acknowledge that Lope\r\nwrote better, nor did he, as a master of the human heart, and as\r\npresenting more affecting situations; but he did, as comprehending and\r\nrepresenting more to the life the manners and feelings of his day.\r\nCervantes easily perceived the faults of his rival; he discovered his\r\nincongruities, and noted the vanity or cupidity which made him more\r\nabundant than correct, and the currying to the depraved taste of the\r\ntimes, through a desire of popularity. In short, Lope was not perfect,\r\nbut he had something that while he lived stood in the stead of\r\nperfection--he hit the public taste; he supplied it with ever fresh and\r\never delightful food; he pleased, he interested, he fascinated. To act\r\nposterity, and judge coolly of his works, was an invidious task; and\r\nthough it was natural that a man so profound and sagacious as Cervantes\r\nshould be impelled so to do, yet, by attacking him and proving him in\r\nthe wrong, he could not weaken his influence, while he made an enemy.\r\nThere is a sonnet against Lope attributed to him, of which the point is\r\nnot acute; but it displays contempt for his pastorals and epics, and\r\nsarcastically alludes to his superabundant fertility. However, it is\r\nmore than probable that Cervantes did not write this sonnet; for he\r\nwrote in praise of Lope in other works, and it was unlike the noble\r\ndisposition of that single-hearted and excellent man to have\r\ncontradicted himself. Still less likely is it that Lope wrote the\r\nanswer. It is vulgarly abusive and ridiculously assuming: he calls\r\nCervantes the horse to Lope's carriage; bids him do Lope honour, or evil\r\nwill betide him; and sums up by saying that \"Don Quixote\" went about the\r\nworld in wrappers to parcels of spices. It looks more like the spurt of\r\nan over-zealous disciple than of a man of Lope's judgment and\r\ncharacter.[97]\r\n\r\nHis war with Gongora was of a more grave description, and we defer\r\nfarther mention of it till in the life of Gongora we give some account\r\nof his poetic system.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lope rose higher and higher in the estimation of the public.\r\nThere is scarcely an example on record of similar popularity. Grandees,\r\nnobles, ministers, prelates, scholars--all solicited his acquaintance.\r\nMen came from distant lands to see him; women stood at their balconies\r\nas he passed, to behold and applaud him. On all sides he received\r\npresents; and we are even told that when he made a purchase, if he were\r\nrecognised, the seller refused payment. His name passed into a proverb;\r\nit became a synonyme for the superlative degree,--a Lope diamond, a Lope\r\ndinner, a Lope woman, a Lope dress, was the expression used to express\r\nperfection in its kind. All this might well compensate for attacks; yet\r\nas these were founded in truth, and he must sometimes have dreaded a\r\nreaction of popularity, he felt at times nettled and uneasy.\r\n[Sidenote: 1616.\r\nÆtat.\r\n54.]\r\nHis part was, however, warmly taken by his adherents. Their intolerance\r\nwas such that they gravely asserted that the author of the \"Spongia,\"\r\nwho had severely censured his works and accused him of ignorance of the\r\nLatin language, deserved death for his heresy.[98]\r\n\r\nHis works were more numerous than can be imagined. Each year he gave\r\nsome new poem to the press; each month, and sometimes every week, he\r\nbrought out a play; and these at least were of recent composition,\r\nthough the former consisted frequently in the productions of his early\r\nyears, corrected and finished. He tried every species of writing, and\r\nbecame celebrated in all. His hymns and sacred poems secured him the\r\nrespect of the clergy, and showed his zeal in the profession he had\r\nembraced. When Philip IV. came to the crown, he immediately heaped new\r\nhonours on Lope; for Philip was a patron of the stage; and several plays\r\nof considerable-merit, published as written \"By a Wit of the Court\" (Por\r\nun Ingenio de esta Corte), are ascribed to him.\r\n[Sidenote: 1621.\r\nÆtat.\r\n59.]\r\nLope published at this time his novels, imitated from Cervantes--whom he\r\ngraciously acknowledges to have displayed some grace and ease of style,\r\nand whom he by no means succeeds in rivalling--and several poems--which\r\nthat they were ever read is a sort of miracle; and the Lope mania must\r\nhave been vehement indeed that could gift readers with patience for his\r\ndiffuseness.\r\n\r\nStill the taste was genuine, (though it seems to us perverted), as is\r\nproved by a rather dangerous experiment which he made. He published a\r\npoem without his name, for the sake of trying the public taste. It\r\nsucceeded; and the favour with which his unacknowledged \"Soliloquies on\r\nGod,\" were received must have inspired him with great reliance on his\r\nown powers. The death of the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots at this\r\ntime spread a very general sensation of pity for her and hatred for her\r\nrival through Spain. Lope made it the subject of a poem, which he called\r\nthe Corona Tragica, which he dedicated to pope Urban VIII.; who thanked\r\nhim by a letter written in his own hand, and by the degree of doctor of\r\ntheology. This was the period of his greatest glory. Cardinal Barberini\r\nfollowed him in the streets; the king stopped to look at him as he\r\npassed; and crowds gathered round him whenever he appeared.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of his writings is incredible. It is calculated that he\r\nprinted one million three hundred thousand lines, and this, he says, is\r\na small part of what he wrote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The printed part, though far too large, is less\r\nThan that which yet unprinted still remains.\"[99]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong these it is asserted that 1800 plays and 400 sacramental dramas\r\nhave been printed. This account long passed as true. Lord Holland\r\ndetected its fallacy; and the author of the article in the Quarterly\r\nfollows up his calculations, and proves the absurdity of the account. He\r\nhimself says, in the preface to the \"Arte de Hacer Comedias,\" that he\r\nhad brought out 483. There are extant 497. Some may be lost certainly,\r\nbut not so many as this computation would assume. Many of his pieces for\r\nthe theatre, indeed, consist of loas and entremeses, small pieces in\r\nsingle acts, which may have been taken in to make up this number, but\r\nwhich do not deserve to rank among plays.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the number of verses he wrote there is also exaggeration.\r\nHe says he often wrote five sheets a day; and the most extravagant\r\ncalculations have been made on this, as if he had written at this rate\r\nfrom the day of his birth, till a month or two after his death. It is\r\nevident, however, that the period when he wrote five sheets a day, and a\r\nplay in the twenty-four hours, was limited to a few years. With all this\r\nhe is doubtless, even in prolific Spain, the most prolific of writers,\r\nand the most facile. Montalvan tells us, that when he was at Toledo, he\r\nwrote fifteen acts in fifteen days, making five plays in a fortnight;\r\nand he adds an anecdote that fell under his own experience. Roque de\r\nFigueroa, a writer for the theatre of Madrid, found himself on an\r\noccasion without any new play, and the doors of his theatre were obliged\r\nto be shut--a circumstance which shows the vast appetite for novelty\r\nthat had arisen, and the cause wherefore Lope was induced to write so\r\nmuch, since the public rather desired what was new than what was good.\r\nBut to return to Montalvan's story. Being carnival, Figueroa was eager\r\nto open his theatre, and Lope and Montalvan agreed to write a play\r\ntogether; and they brought out the \"Tercera Orden de San Francisco,\"\r\ndividing the labour. Lope took the first act and Montalvan the second,\r\nwhich they completed in two days; and the third they partitioned between\r\nthem, eight pages for each; and as the weather was bad, Montalvan\r\nremained all night in Lope's house. The scholar finding that he could\r\nnot equal his master in readiness, wished to surpass him by force of\r\nindustry, and rising at two in the morning, finished his part by eleven.\r\nHe then went to seek Lope, and found him in the garden, occupied by an\r\norange-tree, which had been frost-bitten in the night. Montalvan asked\r\nhow his verses speeded? Lope replied, \"I began to write at five, and\r\nfinished the act an hour ago. I breakfasted on some rashers of bacon,\r\nand wrote an epistle of fifty triplets, and having watered ray garden, I\r\nam not a little tired.\" On this he read his act and his triplets, to the\r\nwonder and admiration of his hearer.\r\n\r\nHe gained considerable profit by his writings. The presents made him by\r\nvarious nobles amounted to a large sum. His plays and autos, and his\r\nvarious publications, brought him vast receipts. He had received a dowry\r\nwith each wife. The king bestowed several pensions and chaplaincies. The\r\npope gifted him with various preferments. With all this he was not rich;\r\nhis absolute income apparently amounted to only 1500 ducats, and profuse\r\ncharities and prodigal generosity emptied his purse as fast as it was\r\nfilled. He spent much on church festivals; he was hospitable to his\r\nfriends, extravagant in his purchase of books and pictures, and\r\nmunificent in his charities, so that when he died he left little behind\r\nhim. We cannot censure this disposition; indeed it is inherent in\r\nproperty gained as Lope gained it, to be lost as soon as won; for being\r\nreceived irregularly, it superinduces irregular habits of expense. That\r\nLope, the observed of all, he to whom nature and fortune had been so\r\nprodigal, should have been grasping and avaricious would have grated on\r\nour feelings. We hear of his profusion with pleasure: the well-watered\r\nsoil, if generous in its nature, gives forth abundant vegetation; the\r\nreceiver of so much showed the nobility of his mind in freely imparting\r\nto others the wealth so liberally bestowed on him.\r\n\r\nIn his epistles and other poems, Lope gives very pleasing pictures of\r\nthe tranquillity of his life as he advanced in age. Addressing don Fray\r\nPlacido de Tosantos, he says: \"I write you these verses, from where no\r\nannoyance troubles me. My little garden inspires fancies drawn from\r\nfruits and flowers, and the contemplation of natural objects.\" In the\r\nepistle before quoted to Amaryllis, he says, \"My books are my life, and\r\nhumble content my actions--unenvious of the riches of others. The\r\nconfusion sometimes annoys me; but, though I live in Madrid, I am\r\nfarther from the court than if I were in Muscovy or Numidia. Sometimes I\r\nlook upon myself as a dwarf, sometimes as a giant, and I regard both\r\nviews with indifference; and am neither sad when I lose, nor joyful when\r\nI gain. The man who governs himself well, despises the praise or blame\r\nof this short though vile captivity. I esteem the sincere and pure\r\nfriendship of those who are virtuous and wise; for without virtue, no\r\nfriendship is secure; and if sometimes my lips complain of ingratitude,\r\nthis is no crime.\" To Francisco de Rioja he writes: \"My garden is small;\r\nit contains a few trees, and more flowers, a trained vine, an orange\r\ntree, and a rose hush. Two young nightingales dwell in it, and two\r\nbuckets of water form a fountain, playing among stones and coloured\r\nshells.\" \"My hopes are fallen,\" he says in another place, \"and my\r\nfortune shuts herself up with me in a nook, filled with books and\r\nflowers, and is neither favourable nor inimical to me.\" In the \"Huerto\r\nDeshecho,\" or Destroyed Garden, he gives further testimony of his love\r\nfor his garden, which had just been laid waste by a tempest. He thus\r\naddresses his fair retreat:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dear solace of my weary sorrow,\r\nUnhappy garden, thou who slept,\r\nForeseeing not the stormy morrow,\r\nThe while the tears that night had wept,\r\nMorning drank up, and all the flowers awoke,\r\nAnd I the pen that told my thoughts up took.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand he goes on bitterly to grieve over the desolation the storm had\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIf there is a touch of melancholy, and a half-checked repining in any of\r\nthese quotations, I do not see that he is to be reprehended. Covered\r\nwith renown and gifted with riches--it is said, who can be happy, if\r\nLope de Vega were not? But we must remember that neither wealth nor fame\r\nare in themselves happiness. Lope had through death lost the dearest\r\nobjects of life; in a spirit of piety he had shut himself out from\r\nforming others. His heart was the source of his disquiet--but he had\r\nrecourse to natural objects for its cure, and often found repose among\r\nthem. That his disposition was amiable and his temper placid, there is\r\nample proof. He says of himself, \"I naturally love those who love me,\r\nand I cannot hate those who hate me:\" and we may believe him: for this\r\nis a virtue a man never boasts of without possessing it; to a nature\r\nformed to hate and to revenge, hatred and revenge seem natural and\r\nnoble. That he was vain is evident: his sort of character, vivacious,\r\nkindly and expansive, tends to vanity. He would have been more than man\r\nnot to have been vain, flattered as he was. Lord Holland mentions his\r\ncomplaints of poverty, obscurity, and neglect, in the preface to the\r\n\"Peregrino,\" but they do not amount to much. He certainly writes in a\r\nvery ill temper, nettled, it would appear, by some plays having appeared\r\nwith his name, which were not written by him. There is more of complaint\r\nin his poem of the \"Huerto Deshecho,\" one of the most elegant and\r\npleasing of his poems. Alluding to his love of study, he says, \"Though\r\nthat be a work of praise, it was but the fatal prelude of the unhappy\r\nresult of my hopes, since, in conclusion, my verses were given to the\r\nwinds. Strong philosophy, and retired, but contented old age animate me\r\non my way. If I do not sing, it is enough that others sing what I\r\ndeplore--devouring time destroys towers of vanity and mountains of gold;\r\none only thing, divine grace, suffers no change.\"\r\n\r\nIt is strange, indeed, that he should say that he had given his verses\r\nto the winds--but he says himself,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No he visto alegre de su bien ninguno--\"\r\nI ne'er saw man content with what he had.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus he passed many years, living according to the dictates of his\r\nconscience, with moderation and virtue; unmindful of life, but deeply\r\nmindful of death, so that he was ever prepared to meet it. His piety\r\nindeed was tinged with superstition; but he was a catholic and a\r\nSpaniard, and dwelt fervently on the means of satisfying the justice of\r\nGod in this world, so as to secure a greater stock of happiness in the\r\nnext. Charitable he was to prodigality; and as he grew old he used his\r\npen on religious subjects only, repenting somewhat of his labours for\r\nthe stage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1635.\r\nÆtat.\r\n73.]\r\n\r\nHis health was good, till, within a very short time before he died, he\r\nfell into a state of hypochondria, which clouded the close of his\r\nexistence.[100] His friend, Alonzo Perez de Montalvan, seeing him thus\r\nmelancholy, asked him to dine with him and a relation, on the day of\r\nTransfiguration, which was the 6th of August. After dinner, as all three\r\nwere conversing on several subjects, he said, that such was the\r\ndepression of spirits by which he was afflicted that his heart failed\r\nhim in his body, and that he prayed God to ease him by shortening his\r\nlife. On which, Juan Perez de Montalvan (his biographer, friend, and\r\npupil) remarked, \"Do not feel thus, I trust in God and in your healthy\r\nlooks, that this indisposition will pass away, and that we shall see you\r\nagain in the health you enjoyed twenty years ago.\" To which Lope replied\r\nwith some emotion, \"Ah, doctor, would to God, I were well over it!\"\r\n\r\nHis presentiments were verified: Lope was soon to die; this his feelings\r\nforetold, and so prepared him for the event. On the 18th of the same\r\nmonth he rose very early, recited the divine service, said mass in his\r\noratory, watered his garden, and then shut himself up in his study. At\r\nmid-day he felt chilled, either from his work among his flowers, or from\r\nhaving, as his servants averred, used the discipline on himself with\r\nseverity, as was proved by the recent marks of blood being found on the\r\ndiscipline, and staining the walls of the room. Lope was indeed a rigid\r\ncatholic, as this circumstance proves, and also his refusing to eat any\r\nthing but fish, though he had a dispensation to eat meat, and it was\r\nordered him during his indisposition. In the evening he attended a\r\nscientific meeting, but being suddenly taken ill, he was obliged to\r\nreturn home. The physicians now gathered round with their prescriptions;\r\nand it happened that doctor Juan de Negrete, the king's physician,\r\npassed through the street, and he was told that Lope de Vega was\r\nindisposed, on which he visited him, not as a doctor, as he had not been\r\ncalled in, but as a friend. He soon perceived his danger, and intimated\r\nthat it were better that he should take the sacrament, with the usual\r\nexcuse, that it was a relief to any one in danger, and could only\r\nbenefit him if he lived. \"If you advise this,\" said Lope \"there must be\r\na necessity;\" and that same night he received the sacrament. Extreme\r\nunction followed but two hours after. He then called for his daughter,\r\nand blessed her, and took leave of his friends as one about to make so\r\nlong a journey; conversing concerning the interests of those left\r\nbehind, with kindness and piety. He told Montalvan, that virtue was true\r\nfame, and that he would exchange all the applause he had received, for\r\nthe consciousness of having fulfilled one more virtuous deed; and\r\nfollowed up these counsels with prayers and acts of catholic piety. He\r\npassed the night uneasily, and expired the next day, weak and worn, but\r\nalive to a sense of religion and friendship to the last.\r\n\r\nHis funeral took place the third day after his death, and was conducted\r\nwith splendour by the duke of Sesa, the most munificent of his patrons,\r\nwhom he had named his executor. Don Luis de Usategui, his son-in-law,\r\nand a nephew, went as mourners, accompanied by the duke of Sesa and many\r\nother grandees and nobles. The clergy of all classes flocked in crowds.\r\nThe procession attracted a multitude; the windows and balconies were\r\nthronged, and the magnificence was such, that a woman going by,\r\nexclaimed, \"This is a Lope funeral!\" ignorant that it was the funeral of\r\nLope himself, and so applying his name as expressive of the excess of\r\nall that was splendid. The church was filled with lamentation when at\r\nlast he was deposited in the tomb. For eight days the religious\r\nceremonies were kept up, and on the ninth, a sermon was preached in his\r\nhonour, when the church was again crowded with the first people of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nBy his will, his daughter, donna Feliciana de Vega, married to don Luis\r\nde Usategui, inherited the moderate fortune he left behind. He added in\r\nhis will a few legacies of pictures, books, and reliques to his friends.\r\n\r\nIn person Lope de Vega was tall, thin, and well made; dark complexioned,\r\nand of a prepossessing countenance; his nose aquiline; his eyes lively\r\nand clear; his beard black and thick. He had acquired much agility, and\r\nwas capable of great personal exertion. He always enjoyed excellent\r\nhealth, being moderate in his tastes, and regular in his habits.\r\n\r\nTo gather Lope's character from the events of his life, and his accounts\r\nof himself, it may be assumed that while young his disposition had all\r\nthe vivacity of the south--that his passions were ardent, his feelings\r\nenthusiastic--that he was heedless and imprudent perhaps, but always\r\namiable and true. Generous to prodigality--pious to bigotry--patriotic\r\nto injustice, he was given to extremes, yet he did not possess the\r\nhigher qualities, the cheerful fortitude, and fearless temper of\r\nCervantes. Time and sorrow softened in after times some portions of his\r\ncharacter; but still in his garden, among his flowers and books, he was\r\nvivacious, perhaps petulant (for his complaints of neglect are to be\r\nattributed to petulancy rather than to a repining temper); warm-hearted,\r\ncharitable and social, vain he might also be, for that we all are. The\r\nactivity of his mind resembled more a spontaneous fertility of soil,\r\nthan the exertion of labour: \"plays and poetry were the flowers of his\r\nplain,\" as he says: and this seems an unexaggerated picture of the ease\r\nwith which he composed. We need scarcely allude to the hypochondria that\r\ndarkened his last hours, as Montalvan seems to mention it as a mere\r\nprecursor of death. If it were more, it is only another proof that the\r\nmind must not work too hard, while it has this fragile body for its\r\ninstrument and prop.\r\n\r\nIn drawing up Lope's character, Montalvan[101] praises him as agreeable\r\nand unpresuming in conversation. He was zealous in the affairs of\r\nothers, careless of his own; kind to his servants, courteous, gallant\r\nand hospitable, and exceedingly well bred. His temper, he says, was\r\nnever ruffled but by those who took snuff before company; with the grey\r\nwho dyed their locks; with men who, born of women, spoke ill of the sex;\r\nwith priests who believed in gipsies; and with persons who without\r\nintentions of marriage asked others their age. Good taste as well as\r\ngood feeling is displayed in most of these slight intimations of\r\ncharacter: it is to be cleanly to dislike to see snuff taken; it is\r\nbeing unusually just always to speak well of women.\r\n\r\nAs no writer ever surpassed him in quantity, so it will be impossible to\r\ngive a full account of his works. We have already mentioned\r\nseveral:--His \"Arcadia,\" the production of his youth, which may be\r\nconsidered the best of such of his writings as are not dramas;--\"The\r\nBeauty of Angelica,\" is chiefly remarkable as showing how superior the\r\nItalian romantic poets are to any that Spain has produced. The\r\n\"Dragontea\" is another poem of which Sir Francis Drake is the hero, and\r\nthe poet has not been sparing of vituperation. It is founded on the last\r\nexpedition of Drake, when, to revenge the armada, and to inflict a deep\r\nblow on the Spanish power, injured by the destruction of its fleet, he\r\nscoured the Spanish coast, and did immense injury to the shipping. The\r\npoem of Lope is very patriotic; the hatred felt in Spain for the English\r\nqueen was furious and personal; the marriage of Philip II. with bloody\r\nqueen Mary, having caused much intercourse between the two nations, and\r\nthe accession of Elizabeth being the signal of our island again falling\r\noff from the Roman Catholic faith; all therefore that could be imagined\r\nof horror for her heresy and wickedness, and that of her ministers,\r\nanimated the soul, and directed the pen of Lope.\r\n\r\nThe \"Jerusalem\" was his next attempt at an epic; of this Richard Cœur\r\nde Lion is the hero, though the English of course are rendered\r\nsubordinate to the Spaniards. We have not read it. Lord Holland\r\npronounces it a failure; and the critic of the Quarterly observes, \"A\r\nfailure indeed it is, and a total one; the plan, when compared to that\r\nof the 'Angelica' is as 'confusion worse confounded,'--it has neither\r\nbeginning, middle, nor end; neither method, nor purpose, nor proportion;\r\nand many of the parts might be extirpated, or, what is more\r\nextraordinary, might change places without any injury to the whole. But\r\nthere is more vigour of thought in it, and more felicity of expression\r\nthan in any other of his longer poems.\" And thus Spaniards alone write;\r\nwith them a poem resembles a pathless jungle: you come to a magnificent\r\ntree, a wild and balmy breathing flower, a mossy pathway, and clear\r\nbubbling fountain; and beside these objects you linger a moment, but\r\nsoon you plunge again among tangled underwood and uncultivated\r\ninterminable wilds. When Lope takes a subject in hand he does not follow\r\nit up as a traveller who has a bourne in view; but he scrambles up every\r\nmountain, visits every waterfall, and plunges into every cavern; and\r\nlike a tourist without a guide in an unknown country, he often loses his\r\nway, and often leads his reader a wild chase after objects, which, when\r\nreached, were not worth visiting.\r\n\r\nThis prodigality of verse, which caused him to be named the Potosi of\r\nrhymes, was indulged in to the utmost, when, on the canonisation of St.\r\nIsidro, he entered into the lists to win the prize instituted for poems\r\nin celebration of the event. Isidro had been elevated into a saint at\r\nthe solicitation of Philip III., who had been cured of a fever by the\r\nbody of the defunct miracle-maker being brought to him. Every Spanish\r\npoet of the age, and they were all but innumerable, entered the lists.\r\nThere are two volumes of Lope's productions, some in his own name,\r\nconsisting of a sort of epic, composed in quintillas, or stanzas of five\r\nshort lines each, a measure more suited to the genius of the Spanish\r\nlanguage than longer ones; and a play, and a vast quantity of lyrics\r\ngiven under the name of Burguillos. These were all burlesque; but\r\nsubsequently Lope continued to adopt the name, and published several\r\npoems under it, among others, the \"Gatomaquia, or War of Cats,\" a mock\r\nheroic, which is a great favourite in Spain. The \"Corona Tragica,\" a\r\npoem written on the death of Mary, queen of Scots, brought him an\r\nincrease of reputation: it is bigoted to the excess of blind Spanish\r\ninquisitorial bigotry, and, except in a few passages, does not rise\r\nabove mediocrity. It is impossible to give even a cursory account of\r\nLope's lyrics and sacred poems. The best of the former are to be found\r\nin the \"Arcadia\" and the \"Dorotea.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is not on any of these productions that the reputation of Lope\r\nreally rests. That was founded on his theatre, and on that it must\r\ncontinue to subsist. There he showed himself master of his art:\r\noriginal, fecund, national, universal, true and spirited, he produced a\r\nform of dramatic writing that, to this day, rules the stage of every\r\ncountry of the world.\r\n\r\nIt was with considerable difficulty that the theatre established itself\r\nat all in Spain, the church setting itself against theatrical\r\nrepresentations. This prejudice has continued even to modern days. No\r\nSpanish monarch since Philip IV. has entered a theatre; and Philip V.,\r\nwhen he found in Farinelli the solace of his painful distemper, not only\r\nnever heard him in a theatre, but caused him to give up the public\r\nstage, when he was admitted to sing privately before him. In the early\r\nday of which we are writing, the clerical outcry was furious, and the\r\ndrama only became tolerated by making over the theatres to two religious\r\ncorporations, one a hospital, and the other of flagellants; and the\r\nwickedness of the stage was permitted[102] for the sake of the benefits\r\nto charity and religion to result therefrom. The sites of the theatres\r\nthen consisted of two open court yards, _corrales_--corral is the\r\nSpanish term for farmyard, or any enclosure for cattle, and long\r\ncontinued to be synonymous with a theatre. The representations took\r\nplace at first in the open air. Alberto Gavasa, an Italian, who brought\r\nover a company of buffoons, was enabled by the greatness of his success\r\nto cover his corral with an awning, the court yard itself was paved and\r\nprovided with movable benches, and called the _patio_, or pit, which no\r\nwomen ever entered. The grandees sat looking out of the windows of the\r\nhouses that looked into the court yard, which government appropriated\r\nand distributed on this occasion. A prince or very great man having a\r\nroom allotted to him, and minor gentlemen a single window, and this\r\nprimitive arrangement was we are told the origin of our boxes. In\r\naddition, there were several galleries, into some of which women only\r\nwere admitted. It was called the _cazuela_, and open to all classes.\r\n\r\nYet even this pious dedication of the proceeds of the theatre did not\r\nsilence the clergy. In 1600, Philip III. ordered the subject to be\r\nreferred to a junta of theologians. This council established certain\r\nconditions on which the performances were to be tolerated, the principal\r\nbeing that women were not to act, nor to mingle with the audience. It\r\nwas at this time, and with this licence that Lope's career was run. He\r\nalone furnished all Spain with plays; and so great a favourite was he,\r\nthat none but his were received with any approbation. On the accession\r\nof Philip IV., a man of pleasure, the theatre was more frequented than\r\never. Yet still, it maybe observed, the clergy nourished a prejudice\r\nagainst it, censured Lope for being the occasion of much sin, and caused\r\nhim on his death bed to express his regret at having written for the\r\nstage, and to promise that if he recovered he would do so no more.\r\n\r\nCervantes boasts of the improvements he occasioned in theatrical\r\nrepresentations. Still his plays, though they have great merit from the\r\npassion and poetry they display, are inartificial in their construction,\r\nwhile Lope on the contrary, became popular from the admirable nature of\r\nhis plots. His dramas are praised by a Spanish critic for \"the purity\r\nand sweetness of his language, for the vivacity of his dialogue, for the\r\npropriety of many of the characters, for his invention, his exact\r\ndescription of national manners, for his serious passages, his merriment\r\nand his wit.\" There is often something barbaric in his carelessness of\r\ntime and place, and also in the hinging on of his incidents: still the\r\nplot was preserved carefully throughout, and the catastrophe showed the\r\nintention of the author to have been always in his mind, even when he\r\nmost seemed to swerve from it. The number of plays that Lope wrote has\r\nbeen alluded to, and is really astonishing: there is something of\r\nsameness, perhaps, at the bottom of all, but this is joined to\r\nprodigious variety and novelty within the circle by which his invention\r\nis circumscribed. He says himself--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Should I the titles now relate\r\nOf plays my endless labour bore,\r\nWell might you doubt, the list so great,\r\nSuch reams of paper scribbled o'er;\r\nPlots, imitations, scenes, and all the rest,\r\nTo verse reduced, in flowers of rhetoric drest.\r\n\r\nThe number of my fables told\r\nWould seem the greatest of them all;\r\nFor strange, of dramas you behold\r\nFull fifteen hundred mine I call,\r\nAnd full an hundred times--within a day,\r\nPassed from my muse, upon the stage, a play.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so entirely did he possess the ear and favour of the audience, that\r\nmany a play of which he was innocent was brought out under his name, and\r\nthus obtained applause.\r\n\r\nThe causes of his success are easily discovered. The Spaniards had\r\nhitherto wanted a national literature. Their poetry and their pastorals\r\ndid not express the heroism, the bigotry, the tenacious honour and\r\nviolent prejudices that formed their character. Their ballads did, and\r\nso did the romances of chivalry; but the latter had become mere\r\nimitations, and while they echoed some of the sentiments they\r\nentertained, did not mirror their manners. It was like a new creation\r\nwhen the poetic genius of Spain embodied itself in the drama, and under\r\nthe guise of tragedy and comedy, each romantic, made visible to an\r\naudience the ideal of their prejudices and passions, their virtues and\r\nvices; and these, in connection with a story that engaged their interest\r\nand warmed their hearts with sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe plays of Lope were either romantic tragedies, or plays of la Capa y\r\nEspada, of the sword and cloak, sometimes tragic and sometimes comic,\r\nbut which were founded on the manners of the day. Of course there is a\r\ngreat deal of killing and slaying, but none of the horrors that startle\r\nthe reader of Titus Andronicus, and other English tragedies of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe point of honour, loyalty, love, and jealousy, form the standard\r\ngroundwork of the dramas of Lope. Lord Holland has analysed the \"Star of\r\nSeville,\" in which the interest depends on an affianced lover killing\r\nthe brother of his betrothed at the instance of the king, and then\r\nrefusing to betray his royal master's secret. Love and jealousy take\r\nsingular forms. It was the custom of the lover to watch beneath the\r\nbarred windows of the house of his lady, and she, if she favoured him,\r\ndescended and conversed with him from her casement. They never hesitate\r\nto acknowledge their love, but it must never be suspected by others.\r\nWere it known that a cavalier were thus favoured, the relations of the\r\nlady would at once assassinate him, and stab her or shut her up in a\r\nconvent. Yet when the lovers have escaped these dangers, they marry, and\r\nat the sound of wedlock the honour of the family is secured; the injury,\r\nto be so mortally avenged, is no longer an injury, and all is well and\r\nhappy. If a husband is jealous, it is not that he doubts the fidelity of\r\nhis wife, or even her attachment, but that she has been placed in a\r\nsituation which might have led to dishonour. Others know this, and she\r\nmust expiate the fault with her life. In the \"Certain for the Doubtful,\"\r\na lady wishing to dissuade the king from marrying her, confesses that\r\nhis brother, who is his rival, had once kissed her without her\r\npermission. The king instantly resolves to have him assassinated, since\r\nhe cannot marry the lady till his brother's death has freed her from the\r\ndishonour that must accrue, while the perpetrator of such an act lives.\r\nHe says at the same time \"I know that there is no reality in what you\r\ntell me, but, although this strange incident be a falsehood invented for\r\nthe purpose of inducing me not to marry you, it suffices that it has\r\nbeen said, to force me to revenge it. If love makes me in any manner\r\ngive credit to your story--Henriquez shall die, and I marry his widow;\r\nfor then, if what you tell me shall be discovered, we shall neither of\r\nus be dishonoured; for you will be the widow of this kiss, as others are\r\nof a husband.\" Accordingly assassins are commissioned to waylay his\r\nbrother. Meanwhile Henriquez and the lady marry, and the king seeing the\r\nevil without remedy, and his honour safe, pardons the lovers.\r\n\r\nSchlegel observes, \"Honour, love, and jealousy are uniformly the\r\nmotives: the plot arises out of their daring and noble collision, and is\r\nnot purposely instigated by knavish deception. Honour is always an ideal\r\nprinciple, for it rests, as I have elsewhere shown, on that higher\r\nmorality which consecrates principles without regard to consequences:\r\nthe honour of the women consists in loving only one man, of pure,\r\nunspotted honour, and loving him with perfect purity: inviolable secrecy\r\nis required till a lawful union permits it to be publicly declared. The\r\npower of jealousy, always alive, and always breaking out in a dreadful\r\nmanner,--not like that of eastern countries, a jealousy of possession,\r\nbut of the slightest emotions of the heart, and its most imperceptible\r\ndemonstrations, serves to ennoble love. In tragedies, this jealousy\r\ncauses honour to become a hostile destiny for him who cannot satisfy it,\r\nwithout either annihilating his own felicity, or becoming even a\r\ncriminal.\"\r\n\r\nSchlegel, in his hatred of the French, espouses with too much warmth,\r\nand elevates too highly the nobleness of the passions on which the\r\ninterest of the Spanish drama is founded. Where jealousy is the main\r\nspring of every action, there is little tenderness; however, it is in\r\nthe comedies that this passion displays itself in the worst light. In\r\ntragedies, death, hovering over the scene, gives dignity and elevation\r\nto that which otherwise must seem the excess of self-love. The comedies\r\npresent a tissue of intrigues and embroglios; but these are arranged\r\nwith so much art, carried on with so much spirit, and aided by sparkling\r\nand natural dialogue, that it is impossible not to be amused, and even\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nTo these subjects are added plays in which religion is the master\r\npassion, where Catholicism is raised to the height which makes its\r\nassumed truth a justification for the worst crimes; and the vengeance\r\nwhich Moor or Jew pursue for infinite injuries, be considered a crime to\r\nbe expiated by a cruel death. In the same way, the point of honour led\r\nto falsehood and dishonourable actions, all of which were considered\r\nvenial, as founded on, or tending to, a lofty aim. Even in the lighter\r\ncomedies, there is a dangerous and ticklish sense of honour always on\r\nthe alert to create danger, and enliven the interest.\r\n\r\nLope also wrote many sacred dramas and Autos Sacramentales. Some of\r\nthese are allegorical; others founded on the lives of the saints. God\r\nAlmighty, the Virgin, the Saviour, and Satan are among his dramatis\r\npersonæ. But in this species of writing he was far surpassed by\r\nCalderon. It required sublimity to give a proper tone to such subjects,\r\nand to this quality Lope cannot pretend. His _entremeses_ or interludes,\r\nfarces they may be called, are full of merriment; his vast facility in\r\ninventing plots enabled him to bestow a subject that might easily be\r\ndrawn out into a comedy of five, on a piece of one act. French and\r\nEnglish writers have consulted him as a mine. In him originated also the\r\nintroduction of the Grazioso, or jester--a clown who makes ludicrous\r\nobservations on what is going on, and turning tragic sentiment into\r\nburlesque, acts as censor upon the motives and actions of the\r\npersonages, and often disturbs the current of interest excited; but\r\noften also the sprightly wit he thus introduces, relieves the monotony\r\nof passion on stilts, and he is always a convenient personage in\r\nexplaining away a difficulty, and disclosing a secret.\r\n\r\nLope, of course, wholly disregards unity of time and place. The\r\nincongruities of his plots are manifold. Success, popular success, was\r\nwhat he aimed at, and he gained it; but he was aware of the barbarism of\r\nmany of his dramas, and has himself warmly censured his plays. In his\r\n\"Arte de hacer Comedias\" he says[103]:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I, doomed to write, the public taste to hit,\r\nResume the barbarous dress 'twas vain to quit:\r\nI lock up every rule before I write,\r\nPlautus and Jerome drive from out my sight,\r\nLest rage should teach those injured wits to join,\r\nAnd their dumb books cry shame on works like mine.\r\nTo vulgar standards then I square my play,\r\nWriting at ease, for, since the public pay,\r\n'Tis just methinks we by their compass steer,\r\nAnd write the nonsense that they love to hear:\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again in the same poem:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"None than myself more barbarous or more wrong,\r\nWho, hurried by the vulgar taste along,\r\nDare give my precepts in despite of rule,\r\nWhence France and Italy pronounce me fool.\r\nBut what am I to do? who now of plays,\r\nWith one complete within these seven days,\r\nFour hundred eighty-three, in all have writ,\r\nAnd all, save six, against the rules of wit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in his eclogue to Claudio:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then spare, indulgent Claudio, spare\r\nThe list of all my barbarous plays;\r\nFor this with truth I can declare,\r\nAnd though 'tis truth, it is not praise,\r\nThe printed part, though far too large, is less\r\nThan that which yet unprinted waits the press.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this severe censure of his own works was joined considerable study of\r\nthe dramatic art. It had engaged his attention, he says, since he was\r\nten years old; and in the \"Dramatic Art\" from which we have just quoted,\r\nhe shows great good taste and penetration in his observations.\r\n\r\nHis plays are not now acted in Madrid. The theatre, indeed, has declined\r\nin Spain, and melodrames and vaudevilles have taken place of the higher\r\nspecies of drama. Still Lope's works are a mine of wealth for any\r\ndramatist, whence to draw situations, plots, and dialogue. Dryden\r\nborrowed much from him; and, notwithstanding his faults, there may be\r\nfound in his plays a richness of invention, a freshness and variety of\r\nideas, and a vivacity of dialogue unsurpassed by any author.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: In an epistle he mentions his father as having emigrated\r\nto Madrid--he speaks of him as living in the valley of Carriedo, but\r\ndeficiency of means caused him to leave his ancestral inheritance of\r\nVega, and to remove to Madrid. There had been a quarrel between him and\r\nhis wife, who was jealous, and with reason, as Lope tells us he loved a\r\nSpanish Helen; she however followed him, and they were reconciled:\r\n\r\n\"Y aquel dia\r\nfu piedra en mi primero fundamento\r\nla paz de su zelosa phantasia.\r\nEn fin por zelos soy; que nascimiento!\r\nimaginalde vos, que haver nacido\r\nde tan inquieta causa fue portento.\"\r\n\r\n_Belardo á Amarylis._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Pellicer, Tratado sobre el origen de la Comedia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: \"Efectos de mi genio y mi fortuna,\r\nque me eseñastes versos en la cuna,\r\ndulce memoria del principio amado\r\ndel ser que tengo, á quien la vida debo,\r\nen este panagyrico me llama\r\ningrato y olvidado,\r\npero si no me atrevo,\r\nno fue falta de amor, sino de fama,\r\nque obligacion me fuerza, amor mi inflama.\r\nMa si Felix de Vega no la tuvo,\r\nbasta saber que en el Parnaso estuvo,\r\nhaviendo hallado yo sus borradores,\r\nversos eran á Dios llenos de amores;\r\ny aunque en el tiempo que escribió los versos,\r\nno eran tan crespos como ahora y tersos,\r\nni las Musas tenían tantos brios,\r\nmejores me parecen que los mios.\"\r\n\r\n_Laurel de Apolo._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Lope often mentions having been a soldier in early youth.\r\nThese expressions are generally used in reference to his having served\r\non board the Invincible Armada, but there is a stanza in the \"Huerto\r\nDeshecho,\" that intimates that he had entered the army at fifteen.\r\n\r\n\"Ni mi fortuna muda\r\nver en tres lustros de mi edad primera\r\ncon la espada desnuda\r\nal bravo Portugues en la Tercera,\r\nni después en las naves Españolas\r\ndel mar Ingles los puertos y las olas.\"\r\n\r\nYet in the following stanza he calls himself \"Soldado de una guerra.\" In\r\nthese verses, and in many others indeed in which he speaks of himself,\r\nhis expressions are so obscure, and the whole stanza so ill worded, that\r\nit is scarcely possible to guess even at what he means. The translation\r\nof these verses seems to be:--\"Nor did my fortune change on seeing me in\r\nthe third lustre of my tender age, with a drawn sword among the brave\r\nPortuguese at Tercera, nor afterwards in the English ports and waves on\r\nboard a Spanish fleet.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Quarterly Review, vol XVIII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Quarterly Review, vol. XVIII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: In this and other quotations the reader must not expect\r\nsense. Even while reprehending Gongora for obscurity, from carelessness\r\nor from a notion of fine writing, Lope's meaning can very often only be\r\nguessed at. This may partly be attributed to misprints; in his best\r\npoems he is, for a Spaniard, singularly perspicuous.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Lord Holland calls Lope's antagonist, a gentleman of\r\nconsiderable rank and importance--Montalvan's expressions denote the\r\ncontrary: \"un hidalgo entre dos luces, de poca hacienda, &c.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Lord Holland's Life of Lope de Vega.

He alludes to his youth\r\nat the time of sailing with the Armada, and his age at the time of\r\nwriting the eclogue to Claudio; and the swiftness with which the\r\ninterval had passed. \"Who could have told thee that there should come a\r\nday when the lip then scarcely deformed by a hair, should be so heavy\r\ncovered with welcome snow (his beard turned white), [and that so swiftly\r\nthat], we do not know whether it was a comet or life?\" Nothing, however,\r\ncan be so ill expressed and obscure.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Quarterly Review, vol.

She entered a convent and was perhaps\r\ndead when Montalvan wrote.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: That unknown ladies should write anonymous letters to\r\npoets expressive of their admiration and sympathy, is, it seems, no mere\r\nmodern fashion. The epistle trom Amaryllis to Belardo, was certainly not\r\nwritten by Lope himself--it is too full of enthusiastic praise; and the\r\nstyle is not his. It is well written, and interesting. Amaryllis\r\naddresses him from the New World. She describes herself as a creole,\r\nborn of noble parents, in Peru. She and her sister were left early\r\norphans--both endowed with beauty and talent. Her sister marries, but\r\nshe dedicates herself to a life of celibacy, though she does appear to\r\nbe a nun; she loves and cultivates poetry. She writes to Lope de Vega to\r\noffer her friendship--_una alma pura á tu valor rendida--accepta el\r\ndon, que puedes estimallo_--and to exhort him to write religious poetry;\r\nand in particular, to celebrate St. Dorothea--a saint hitherto unsung,\r\nwhom she and her sister hold in particular reverence. Lope replies with\r\npraises of her talents, and enters into a succinct account of his life,\r\nfrom which we have quoted, and says \"I have written to you, Amaryllis,\r\nmore than I ever thought to do concerning myself--this freedom proves my\r\nfriendship for you.\" He concludes by inviting her to celebrate St.\r\nDorothea herself, and bids her immortalise the memory of her heroic\r\nancestors, and bestow on them the eternal laurel of her pen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Pellicer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Lord Holland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: The translation is from Lord Holland.

He was\r\nregarded by Lope as his favourite pupil and friend. He was notary to the\r\ninquisition. At the age of seventeen he wrote plays in the style of his\r\nfriend and teacher, and continued to write after the death of Lope, with\r\nan assiduity and speed that rivalled him. He died in 1639, at the age of\r\nthirty-five only; and had already written nearly a hundred comedies and\r\nautos as well as several novels. These last are imaginative and\r\nentertaining. His comedies are not so finished nor well arranged as\r\nLope's, but they have great merit, and indicate still greater powers,\r\nhad he flourished in an age when such could have been developed, or if\r\nhe had lived long enough to bring them to perfection.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Peliccer--Tratado sobre el Origen de la Comedia.

When we turn to the \"Laurel de Apolo\" of Lope de Vega,\r\nand see stanza after stanza devoted to different poets; and when, in the\r\n\"Voyage to Parnassus\" of Cervantes we find poets rain in showers, we\r\ngive up the task as hopeless--especially when we are told that, although\r\nmany of those so brought forward are unknown, many there are, who wrote\r\nwell, who are not mentioned at all in these works.\r\n\r\nPoetry was then the fashion; and it was easy to spin many hundred lines\r\nwith few ideas, and those few common-place, though pretty and graceful.\r\nDespotism and the inquisition gave the creative or literary spirit of\r\nSpain no other outlet. Thought was forbidden. Description, moral\r\nreflection, where no originality nor boldness was admitted, and love and\r\nsentiment,--these were all the subjects that Spanish poets rung the\r\nchanges on, till we wonder where they found fresh words for the same\r\nthoughts. In any longer poems they wholly failed: and the only\r\ncompositions we read with pleasure are songs, madrigals, redondillas,\r\nand romances, which are often fresh and sparkling--warm from the heart,\r\neither dancing with animal spirits or soft with pathetic tenderness.\r\nAmong the writers of such, none excelled Vicente Espinel. The following\r\nis a specimen, and may be taken as an example of that style of Spanish\r\npoetry, simple, feeling and elegant, which preceded the innovations of\r\nthe refined school. It is taken from Dr. Bowring's translation, and is\r\ngood, though not comparable to the charming simplicity of the\r\noriginal:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A thousand, thousand times, I seek[104]\r\nMy lovely maid;\r\nBut I am silent still--afraid\r\nThat if I speak,\r\nThe maid might frown, and then my heart would break.\r\n\r\nI've oft resolved to tell her all,\r\nBut dare not--what a woe 't would be\r\nFrom doubtful favour's smiles to fall\r\nTo the harsh frown of certainty.\r\nHer grace, her music cheers me now;\r\nThe dimpled roses on her cheek;\r\nBut fear restrains my tongue--for how,\r\nHow should I speak,\r\nWhen, if she frown'd, my troubled heart would break?\r\n\r\nNo, rather I'll conceal my story\r\nIn my full heart's most secret cell:\r\nFor though I feel a doubtful glory,\r\nI 'scape the certainty of hell.\r\nI lose, 't is true--the bliss of heaven,--\r\nI own my courage is but weak,--\r\nThat weakness may be well forgiven,\r\nFor should she speak\r\nIn words ungentle--O, my heart would break!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVicente Espinel was born at Ronda, a city of Granada, in the year 1544.\r\nHe was of poor parentage, and left his native town early to seek his\r\nfortunes. A countryman, don Francisco Pacheco, bishop of Malaga, so far\r\nfavoured as to ordain him, and he became a beneficiary of the church at\r\nRonda. He sought better preferment at court, but met with no success,\r\neither in his own native place nor out of it. In Ronda itself he had\r\nenemies, who pursued him with such calumnies and malignity that he\r\nwithdrew into a sort of voluntary exile, which, loving Granada as he\r\ndid, he bitterly lamented. He was at first a friend, and then an\r\nattacker, of Cervantes, which circumstance does not redound to his\r\ncredit.[105] Lope de Vega speaks of his poetry with the approbation it\r\ndeserved. He was a musician as well as a poet, and added a fifth string\r\nto the Spanish guitar. He died poor and in obscurity at Madrid, in 1634,\r\nin the ninetieth year of his age. He describes himself in some spirited\r\nand comic verses, as singularly ugly--a tub with a priest's cap at top,\r\na monster of fat;--large face, short neck, short arms, each hand looking\r\nlike a tortoise, slow of foot: \"whoever sees me,\" he says, \"so fat and\r\nreverend-looking, might think that I were a rich and idle epicure.--What\r\na pretty figure for a poet!\"\r\n\r\nAnother writer of the natural school; named the Anacreon of Spain, more\r\neasy, sweet and spirited even than Vicente Espinel, was Estévan Manuel\r\nde Villegas. He was born in the city of Nagera of Naxera, in the\r\nprovince or Rioja, in Old Castile, in the year 1595. He was of a noble\r\nand distinguished family. He spent his boyish years at Madrid. At\r\nfourteen he was entered in the university of Salamanca, and studied the\r\nlaw. His tastes inclined him, however, to the more agreeable parts of\r\nliterature: he was a proficient in Latin and Greek; and, at fourteen,\r\ntranslated from Anacreon and Horace; and at the same time wrote original\r\nanacreontics, which he published in 1618, in his twenty-third year.\r\n\r\nOn the death of his father, he returned to Nagera, to assist his widowed\r\nmother, and attend to the interests of his estate. Here, in retirement\r\nand peace, he dedicated himself to the acquirement of knowledge and the\r\ncultivation of poetry. He married, in the year 1626, donna Antonia de\r\nLeyva Villodas, a beautiful and distinguished lady. Having six children,\r\nhe endeavoured, by means of powerful friends, to obtain some employment\r\nthat might add to his scanty income, and give him leisure at the same\r\ntime to prosecute various designs in literature and poetry which he\r\nprojected on a large scale, but he only succeeded in being appointed to\r\na place of slight importance and emolument \"Thus,\" says Sedano, \"this\r\ngreat man was, in common with almost every other person of eminence,\r\npursued by adversity, which was the cause that his talents did not shine\r\nas brilliantly as they might have done, and that his name has not come\r\ndown with due celebrity to our days.\" At last, giving up hope of worldly\r\nadvancement, he retired to his estate, where he died in 1669, in the\r\nseventy-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\nAlthough the conceits, the fashion of the age, sometimes deteriorate\r\nfrom Villegas's poetry, he has more natural facility, added to classical\r\ncorrectness, than almost any other Spanish poet. His verses flow on with\r\nelegance and softness, joined to a nature and feeling quite enchanting.\r\nHis translations of Anacreon have the simplicity and pure unencumbered\r\nexpression of the original; that of the \"Dove\" breathes Anacreon\r\nhimself. For the sake of the Spanish reader it is appended at the bottom\r\nof the page[106], and he can compare it with the Greek, and perceive\r\nthat Anacreon never found poet so capable of transfusing into another\r\nlanguage the vivacity, and grace of his lyrics.\r\n\r\nHis original Anacreontics may almost be said to deserve a place beside\r\nthe immortal Greek. We copy from Mr. Wiffen's pages one of his sapphics,\r\nrendered pre-eminent by its delicacy and beauty:--\r\n\r\n\"TO THE ZEPHYR.\r\n\r\n\"Sweet neighbour of the green, leaf-shaking grove,\r\nEternal guest of April, frolic child\r\nOf a sad sire, life-breath of mother Love,\r\nFavonius, Zephyr mild!\r\n\r\nIf thou has learned like me to love,--away!\r\nThou who hast borne the murmurs of my cry;\r\nHence--no demur--and to my Flora say,\r\nSay that 'I die!'\r\n\r\nFlora once knew what bitter tears I shed;\r\nFlora once wept to see my sorrows flow;\r\nFlora once loved me--but I dread, I dread\r\nHer anger now.\r\n\r\nSo may the Gods--so may the calm blue sky,\r\nFor the fair time that thou in gentle mirth\r\nSport'st in the air, with love benign deny\r\nSnows to the earth!\r\n\r\nSo never may the grey cloud's cumbrous sail,\r\nWhen from on high the rosy day-break springs,\r\nBeat on thy shoulders, nor its evil hail\r\nWound thy fine wings!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: \" Mil veces voy á hablar\r\ná mi zagala,\r\npero mas quiero callar,\r\npor no esperar\r\nque me envie noramala\r\n\r\nVoy á decirla mi daño\r\npero tengo por mejor,\r\ntener dudoso el favor\r\nque no cierto el desengaño;\r\ny aunque me suele animar\r\nsu gracia y gala,\r\nel temer me hace callar,\r\npor no esperar\r\nque me envie noramala.\r\n\r\nTengo por suerte mas buena\r\nmostrar mi lingua á ser muda,\r\nque estando la gloria en duda\r\nno estara cierta la pena\r\ny aunque con disimular\r\nse desiguala,\r\ntengo por mejor callar,\r\nque no esperar\r\nque me envie noramala.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Viardôt, in his life of Cervantes, mentions that Vicente\r\nEspinel became his enemy. I have not discovered on what he grounds this\r\nassertion. In the postscript to the \"Voyage to Parnassus\", one of the\r\nlatest of Cervantes's works, he feigns that Apollo sent messages to\r\nvarious Spanish poets \"You will give my compliments,\" the God writes,\r\n\"to Vicente Espinel, as to one of the oldest and truest friends I\r\nhave.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: \"Amada Palomilla,\r\n¿ de dónde, di, ú adonde\r\nvienes con tanta prisa,\r\nvas con tantos olores?\r\n¿ Pues a ti que te importa?\r\nSabras que Anacreonte\r\nme envía a su Batílo,\r\nSeñor de todo el orbe:\r\nque como por un himno\r\nme emancipo Dione:\r\nnómbrome su page,\r\ny el por tal recibióme.\r\nSuyas son estas cartas,\r\nsuyos estos renglones,\r\npor lo qual me prometo\r\nlibertad quando torno.\r\nPero yo no la quiero,\r\nni quiero que me ahorre;\r\nporque¿ de que me sirve\r\nandar cruzando montes\r\ncomer podridas bacas,\r\nni pararme en los robres?\r\nA mi pues me permite\r\nel mismo Anacreonte\r\ncomer de sus viandas,\r\nbeber de sus licores:\r\nY quando vien brindada\r\ndoy saltos voladores,\r\nle cubro con mis alas,\r\ny el dulce las acoge.\r\nSu citara es mi cama,\r\nsus cuerdas mis colchones,\r\nen quien suavamente\r\nduermo toda la noche.\r\nMi historia es esta, amigo,\r\npero queda á los dioses,\r\nque me has hecho parlera\r\nmas que graja del bosque.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGONGORA\r\n\r\n1561-1627.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Luis de Gongora y Argote was born at Cordova on the 11th July 1561.\r\nHis father was don Francisco de Argote, corregidor of Cordova, his\r\nmother was donna Leonor de Gongora, both of ancient and distinguished\r\nnoble families; and, as the name of his father was equally patrician\r\nwith that of his mother, his having given preference to the latter has\r\nexcited surprise among his Spanish biographers. At the age of fifteen he\r\nentered the university of Salamanca, and studied the law; but his\r\ninclination led him rather to the cultivation of poetry and general\r\nliterature; and while at Salamanca, he wrote many amatory, satirical,\r\nand burlesque poems. At this time he had so severe an illness, that for\r\nthree days he was believed to be dead, and his resuscitation was\r\nregarded almost as a miracle.\r\n\r\nHe passed his early life at Cordova, known and esteemed as a poet and a\r\nman of talent. His spirit was high, his character ardent and\r\npenetrating, and his pen ready, so that he was induced to indulge in\r\npersonal satire, a circumstance which in after years he deeply\r\nregretted; and he changed so much that a friend of his writes, \"he\r\nbecame the most ingenuous, candid, and unoffending man in conversation\r\nand writing that Spain ever saw.\" At the age of forty-five he took holy\r\norders, and soon after visited Madrid, invited by several nobles who,\r\nesteeming his worth, and regretting his slender means, believed that he\r\nwould there be enabled to increase them. But though he frequented the\r\nsociety of the great, he was but slightly benefited. However, through\r\nthe patronage of the duke of Lerma and the marques de Siete Iglesias, he\r\nwas named honorary chaplain to Philip III. He was held in much esteem by\r\nthose nobles who cultivated literature, on account of his great talents;\r\nand he founded a sort of school of literature whose disciples were\r\nbigoted, zealous, and intolerant.\r\n\r\nHe thus wasted eleven years at court, not deceived by vain hopes, for\r\nhis experienced understanding prevented his entertaining any such\r\nillusions, but forced by necessity. He was then taken suddenly and\r\ndangerously ill, while attending on the king in a journey to Valentia,\r\naway from all his friends; the queen, however, hearing of his illness,\r\nsent a physician to attend him. His head was attacked in a manner not so\r\nmuch to destroy reason, as to take from him all memory; and in this\r\nmanner he continued lost to the end of his life. At one time, during a\r\nshort interval of comparative health, he returned to Cordova that he\r\nmight be buried in his native place. Not long after he died, on the 24th\r\nMay, 1627, at the age of sixty-six.\r\n\r\nIn person Gongora was tall and robust, his face large, his eyes\r\npenetrating and lively, his whole appearance venerable, though severe\r\nand adust, hearing marks of the causticity and satire of his\r\ndisposition, which however softened as he grew older. He was a\r\ndisappointed man. His talents, his understanding, the grasp of mind of\r\nwhich he felt himself capable, nourished an internal ambition, which\r\nbeing ungratified, turned to discontent. It was some satisfaction to his\r\nimperious disposition to found a school of poetry, and attack the chief\r\nwriters of the day, Cervantes and Lope de Vega, the Argensolas and\r\nQuevedo, in reply to their just criticisms on his inflated and tortuous\r\nstyle; and it was balm to his pride to hear the applause of his\r\nfollowers. But it is greatly to his discredit that, while heretofore the\r\ndisputes of the Spanish poets with regard to literature were conducted\r\nwith temper, and for the most part with urbanity, Gongora indulged in\r\nscurrility and abuse. His excuse, Sedano tells us, is, that this sort of\r\ninsolence was the fruit of youthful arrogance: yet, as he was a year\r\nolder than Lope, and contemporary with most of the others, he could not\r\nhave been so very young when he entered the lists against them. However,\r\nas he grew older, visited Madrid, went to court, and took orders, he\r\nthrew off the presumption he nourished in his native town, and became\r\ngentle, humane, and modest, and regretted his former excesses of temper.\r\n\r\nThe terms in which his friends speak of him, prove that the honesty and\r\nintegrity of his disposition, and his great understanding, inspired them\r\nwith love and veneration; for, though their language be exaggerated,\r\nstill it bears marks of sincerity. A friend and disciple writing his\r\nlife, soon after his death, speaks of him as \"the greatest man that not\r\nonly Spain, but the world ever saw.\" He laments his brief career, as he\r\nnames sixty-six years; but his praises being written in the excess of\r\nthe _culto_ style, it is impossible almost to understand--quite\r\nimpossible to translate them. In this style the literal translation only\r\noffers nonsense: there is a hidden meaning which is to be guessed at,\r\nand that, so metaphoric and obscure, that it very much resembles a\r\nChinese puzzle--difficult to put together, and, when, discovered and\r\narranged, not worth the trouble. The _cultoristos_ themselves nourished\r\nunbounded contempt for any thing that was at all explicable to common\r\nunderstandings in a common manner.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that in the early poetry of Gongora there is no trace\r\nof this style which he afterwards invented (as his followers called it),\r\nand insisted upon as a prodigy of good taste and poetic genius. His\r\nearly poetry is peculiarly simple and plain. He wrote redondillas or\r\nseguidillas in the old Spanish style, on the most common-place topics,\r\nwhich yet he treats with spirit and power; others of his poems are\r\nsoftly pathetic; but all are written without inflation--without\r\nconceits, but with all that fire and brilliancy--that gaiety and\r\npoignancy which characterised his vivid imagination. Of the first\r\nmentioned, those that even verge on the common-place, we may mention the\r\n\"Child's Address to his Sister,\" as to how they should amuse themselves\r\non a holiday; in which he describes the pleasures of Spanish children,\r\nwith infinite vivacity and nature. The subject of another, is the story\r\nof Hero and Leander. He transforms the hero and heroine of this romantic\r\nlove story, into two poor peasants--she too poor to buy a lantern, he to\r\nhire a boat. The catastrophe, the last swimming of Leander, his coming\r\nto the dreary, stormy sea beach, and his throwing himself in--though\r\ntarnished by vulgarisms, is lively and picturesque. In all that he wrote\r\nthere was fire and spirit, facility and a diction truly poetic. One of\r\nhis sweetest lyrics is the \"Song of Catherine of Arragon,\" lamenting her\r\nsad destiny; it will prepossess the reader in favour of Gongora's pure\r\nstyle, and we therefore quote the translation of Dr. Bowring:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE SONG OF CATHERINE OF ARRAGON.\r\n\r\n\"O take a lesson, flowers! from me,\r\nHow in a dawn all charms decay--\r\nLess than my shadow doomed to be,\r\nWho was a wonder yesterday.\r\n\r\nI, with the early twilight born,\r\nFound ere the evening shades, a bier,\r\nAnd I should die in darkness lorn,\r\nBut that the moon is shining here.\r\nSo must _ye_ die--though ye appear\r\nSo fair--and night your curtain be;\r\nO take a lesson, flowers! from me.\r\n\r\nMy fleeting being was consoled\r\nWhen the carnation met my view:\r\nOne hurrying day my doom has told--\r\nHeaven gave that lovely flower but two.\r\nEphemeral monarch of the wold--\r\nI clad in gloom--in scarlet he;\r\nO take a lesson, flowers! from me.\r\n\r\nThe jasmin, sweetest flower of flowers,\r\nThe soonest is its radiance fled;\r\nIt scarce perfumes as many hours\r\nAs there are starbeams round its head.\r\nIf living amber fragrance shed,\r\nThe jasmine sure its shrine must be:\r\nO take a lesson, flowers! from me.\r\n\r\nThe bloody-warrior fragrance gives,\r\nIt towers unblushing, proud and gay;\r\nMore days than other flowers it lives,\r\nIt blooms through all the days of May.\r\nI'd rather like a shade decay,\r\nThan such a gaudy being be:\r\nO take a lesson, flowers! from me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following song, sent with flowers, and asking from his lady a kiss\r\nfor every sting he received while gathering them, is tender and\r\nelegant:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From my summer alcove, which the stars this morn\r\nWith lucid pearls o'erspread,\r\nI've gathered these jessamines, thus to adorn\r\nWith a wreath thy graceful head.\r\nFrom thy bosom and mouth, they, as flowers, ere death,\r\nAsk a purer white, anti a sweeter breath.\r\n\r\nTheir blossoms, a host of bees, alarmed\r\nWatched over on jealous wing,\r\nHoarse trumpeters seemed they all, and armed\r\nEach bee with a diamond sting:\r\nI tore them away, but each flower I tore\r\nHas cost me a wound which smarteth sore.\r\n\r\nNow as I these jessamine flowers entwine,\r\nA gift for thy fragrant hair,\r\nI must have, from those honey-sweet lips of thine,\r\nA kiss for each sting I bear:\r\nIt is just that the blooms I bring thee home\r\nBe repaid by sweets from the golden comb.[107]\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHis poems in Spanish metres, his letrillas and romances, have the same\r\nbrilliancy of expression, warmth of emotion, and vivid colouring. The\r\n\"Ballad of Angelica and Medora\" is particularly airy and fresh, but rich\r\nand strong as a deep clear inland river that reflects the gorgeous tints\r\nof the sky. Gongora surpasses every other Spanish lyrist, in the\r\nbrilliant colouring of his poetry, and the vivacity of his expression.\r\n\r\nBut all this he voluntarily set at nought. Instead of writing as a poet,\r\nhe adopted the crabbed critic's art, and, extreme in all things, gave no\r\nquarter even to the beauties of his own compositions. He might reprove\r\nthe diluted interminable poems of Lope, and the unpoetic style of\r\nCervantes; he might have been displeased with the poverty of ideas and\r\nenervated conceptions of many of his contemporaries; but he might have\r\nbeen satisfied with his own ease, purity, and strength: he, however,\r\nrejected even these, and instituted a system: a new dialect was\r\ninvented, a new construction adopted,--new words, a dislocated\r\nconstruction, a profusion and exaggeration of figures were introduced.\r\n\"He rose,\" one of his disciples writes, \"to the sublime height of\r\nrefinement (_cultura_), which ignorance holds in distaste, and\r\naccomplished the greatness off 'Polyphemus,' the 'Soledades,' and other\r\nshorter, but not less, poems.\" He grew almost frantic in the\r\ndissemination of his system; and in his vehemence against its opponents,\r\nhe became lost to poetry, and lives, even to this day, more remembered\r\nas a fantastic and ill-judging innovator, than as one of the most\r\nnatural, brilliant, and imaginative poets that Spain ever produced.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega has written a letter, or rather essay, upon Gongora and his\r\nsystem, and gives the following account of both:\r\n\r\n\"I have known this gentleman for eight-and-twenty years, and I hold him\r\nto be possessed of the rarest and most excellent talent of any in\r\nCordova, so that he need not yield even to Seneca or Lucan, who were\r\nnatives of the same town. Pedro Linan de Riaza, his contemporary at\r\nSalamanca, told me much of his proficiency in study, so that I\r\ncultivated his acquaintance, and improved it by the intercourse we had\r\nwhen I visited Andalusia; and it always appeared as if he liked and\r\nesteemed me more than my poor merits deserve. Many other distinguished\r\nmen of letters at that time competed with him:--Herrera, Vicente\r\nEspinel, the two Argensolas, and others, among whom this gentleman held\r\nsuch place, that Fame said the same of him as the Delphic oracle did of\r\nSocrates.\r\n\r\n\"He wrote in all styles with elegance, and in gay and festive\r\ncompositions his wit was not less celebrated than Martial's, while it\r\nwas far more decent. We have several of his works composed in a pure\r\nstyle, which he continued for the greater part of his life. But, not\r\ncontent with having reached the highest step of fame in sweetness and\r\nsoftness, he sought (I have always believed with good and sincere\r\nintentions, and not with presumption, as his enemies have asserted), to\r\nenrich the art, and even language, with such ornaments and figures as\r\nwere never before imagined nor seen. In my opinion he fulfilled his aim,\r\nif this was his intent; the difficulty rests in receiving his system:\r\nand so many obstacles have arisen, that I doubt they will never cease,\r\nexcept with their cause; for I think the obscurity and ambiguity of his\r\nexpressions must be disagreeable to many. By some he is said to have\r\nraised this new style into a peculiar class of poetry; and they are not\r\nmistaken: for, as in the old manner of writing, it took a life to become\r\na poet, in this new one it requires but a day: for, with these\r\ntranspositions, four rules, and six Latin words or emphatic phrases,\r\nthey rise so high that they do not know--far less understand themselves.\r\nLipsius wrote a new Latin, which those who are learned in such things\r\nsay Cicero and Quintilian laugh at in the other world; and those who\r\nhave imitated him are so wise that they lose themselves. And I know\r\nothers who have invented a language and style so different from Lipsius\r\nthat they require a new dictionary. And thus those who imitate this\r\ngentleman produce monstrous births--and fancy that, by imitating his\r\nstyle, they inherit his genius. Would to God they imitated him in that\r\npart which is worthy of adoption; for every one must be aware that there\r\nis much that is deserving of admiration, while the rest is wrapt in the\r\ndarkness of such ambiguity as I have found the cleverest men at fault\r\nwhen they tried to understand it. The foundation of this edifice is\r\ntransposition, rendered the more harsh by the disjoining of substantives\r\nfrom adjectives, where no parenthesis is possible, so that even to\r\npronounce it is difficult: tropes and figures are the ornaments, so\r\nlittle to the purpose, that it is as if a woman, when painting herself,\r\ninstead of putting the rouge on her cheeks, should apply it to her nose,\r\nforehead and ears. Transpositions may be allowed, and there are common\r\nexamples, but they must be appropriate. Boscan, Garcilaso, and Herrera\r\nuse them. Look at the elegance, softness, and beauty of the divine\r\nHerrera, worthy of imitation and admiration! for, it is not to enrich a\r\nlanguage, to reject its natural idiom, and adopt instead phrases\r\nborrowed from a foreign tongue; but, now, they write in the style of the\r\ncurate who asked his servant for the \"anserine reed,\" telling her that\r\n\"the Ethiopian licour was wanting in the cornelian vase.\" These people\r\ndo not attend to clearness or dignity of style, but to the novelty of\r\nthese exquisite modes of expression, in which there is neither truth nor\r\npropriety, nor enlargement of the powers of language; but an odious\r\ninvention that renders it barbarous, imitated from one who might have\r\nbeen an object of just admiration to us all.\"[108]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these grave and reasonable arguments, Lope attacked the\r\nculto style with ridicule, better suited to explode the would-be\r\ninvention of the unintelligible. In several plays he alludes to it with\r\ngood humoured raillery. In one of them, a cavalier desirous of making\r\nuse of the talents of a poet to write for him, asks--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cav._ A plain or polished bard?[109]\r\n\r\n_Poet._ Refined my style.\r\n\r\n_Cav._ My secrets then remain with me to write.\r\n\r\n_Poet._ Your secrets? Why?\r\n\r\n_Cav._ For, with refinement penned.\r\nTheir meaning sure no soul shall comprehend.[110]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another play, a lady describing her rival, ridicules her as,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She who writes in that high polished style,\r\nThat language so charmingly Greek,\r\nWhich never was heard in Castile,\r\nAnd her mother ne'er taught her to speak.\"[111]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to these quotations, there are many more chance arrows let\r\nfly at the absurdity, in his volume of burlesque poetry, written under\r\nthe name of Tomé de Burguillos, in the shape of parodies on this style.\r\nWe select one which however ridiculous it reads, is a very moderate\r\nrepresentation of the bombast Gongora brought into fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"TO A COMB, THE POET NOT KNOWING WHETHER IT\r\nWAS OF BOX OR IVORY.\r\n\r\n\"Sail through the red waves of the sea of love,\r\nO, bark of Barcelona, and between\r\nThe billows of those ringlets proudly move,\r\nAnd now be hidden there, and now be seen!\r\nWhat golden surges, Love, who lurks beneath,\r\nWeaves with the windings of that splendid hair!\r\nBe grateful for thy bliss, and leave him there,\r\nIn joyance unmolested by thy teeth.\r\nO tusk of elephant, or limb of box,\r\nGently unravel thou her tangled locks,\r\nGently the windings of those curls unfold,\r\nLike the sun's rays, in parallels arrange them,\r\nAnd through the labyrinth shape thy paths of gold,\r\nEre yet to silver envious time shall change them.\"[112]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Lope on these occasions, and on many others, takes occasion to\r\nreprehend and satirise this new system, his disciples held it up as the\r\nwonder of the world; they called it the _estilo culto_, or refined\r\nstyle, and themselves _cultoristos_: each phrase was to be twisted, each\r\nword to receive a new and deeper meaning, while mythology, and all sorts\r\nof phantastic imagery, gave a bombastic gilding to the whole; and when\r\nthey had written verses high in sound, but obscure and simple in\r\nmeaning, they fancied they had arrived at sublimity. Thus, a petty hill\r\nassumes the proportions of a mountain in the evening mist. We may look\r\nat it with wonder, we may lose our way or tumble into a ditch in\r\nendeavouring to reach it; but; once at its summit, and we find ourselves\r\nscarcely elevated above the plain.\r\n\r\nThe \"Polyphemus\" and the \"Solitudes\" of Gongora, are, as has been\r\nmentioned, the poems written in his most exaggerated style. The\r\n\"Polyphemus\" begins with a description of the giant, who \"was a mountain\r\nof members eminent.\" His dark hair was a \"knotty imitation of the turbid\r\nwaves of Lethe; and, as the wind combs them stormily, they fly\r\ndishevelled, or hang down disordered: his beard is a torrent, the\r\ndried-up offspring of this Pyrenees! Trinacria has no wild beast in its\r\nmountains armed with such cruelty, shod with such wind, whose ferocity\r\ncan defend, nor whose speed may save! Their skins, spotted with a\r\nhundred colours, are his cloak; and thus he drives in his oxen to their\r\nstall, treading the doubtful light of morn.\" His \"Soledades\" or\r\n\"Solitudes,\" commence even more in the _estilo culto_, and with such\r\nvery refined phrases and images that no one can make any thing of it. We\r\ngive a short passage with Sismondi's translation, and the Spanish, that\r\nthe reader may judge in what a jungle of interminable words, and\r\nheterogeneous ideas, this mistaken poet lost himself:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'T was in the flowery season of the year,\r\nWhen fair Europa's ravisher disguised,\r\n(A crescent moon, the arms upon his brow,\r\nAnd strewed with sunbeams all his glitt'ring skin),\r\nShines out the glowing honour of the sky,\r\nAnd the stars pastures in the azure fields,\r\nWhen he who well the cup of Jove might fill\r\nMure gracefully than Ida's shepherd boy,\r\nWas wrecked--and scorned as well as far away,\r\nThe tears of love and amorous complaints\r\nGave to the sea, which he then pitying\r\nImparts to rustling leaves, that to the wind\r\nRepeats the saddest sighs,\r\nSoft as Arion's softest instrument--\r\nAnd from the mountain top a pine which aye\r\nStruggled with its fierce enemy the North,\r\nThere rent a pitying limb--and the brief plank\r\nBecame a no small dolphin to the youth\r\nWho wand'ring heedlessly, was forced t'intrust\r\nHis way unto a Libyan waste of sea,\r\nAnd his existence to an ocean-skiff,\r\nAt first sucked in, and afterwards thrown forth,\r\nWhere not far off a rock there stood, whose top\r\nWas crowned with bulrushes, and feathers warm\r\nWith seaweed dank and foam besprent all o'er,\r\nAnd rest and safety found there where a nest\r\nThe bird of Jove had built.\r\nHe kissed the sands, and of the broken skiff,\r\nThe portion that was thrown upon the beach\r\nHe gave the rock--and let the rugged cliffs\r\nBehold his loveliness, for naked stood\r\nThe youth.--The ocean first had drunk, and then\r\nRestored his vestments to the yellow sands,\r\nAnd in the sunshine he extended them,\r\nAnd the sun licking them with his sweet tongue\r\nOf tempered fire, slowly invests them round,\r\nAnd sucks the moisture from the smallest thread.\"[113]\r\n\r\n\r\nSismondi only gives half this sentence, but the latter part is the most\r\nintelligible; and besides it was difficult to refrain from presenting\r\nthe reader with the refined image (_culta figura_) of the manner in\r\nwhich the shipwrecked boy's clothes were dried. In a hurried translation\r\nof this sort, the harmony of verse is not preserved; and that, it must\r\nbe remarked, is great, and one of Gongora's chief beauties. There is,\r\nindeed, a sort of dusky gorgeousness throughout; but it makes the reader\r\nsmile, to be told that this style of poetry was new and unknown, and\r\n\"superior to aught that man ever before imagined or composed:\" that it\r\nwas to supersede Garcilaso, Herrera, and Gongora himself in his better\r\ndays. Such was the faith of the _cultoristos_, such their hope in the\r\n_estilo culto._\r\n\r\nSismondi's translation of the first part of this sentence runs\r\nthus:--\"C'était la saison fleurie de l'année dans laquelle le\r\nravisseur déguisé d'Europe, portant sur son front pour armes une\r\ndemie-lune, et tous les rayons du soleil disséminés sur son front,\r\ndevenu un honneur brillant du ciel, menait paître des étoiles dans des\r\nchamps de saphir; lorsque celui qui était bien plus fait pour\r\nprésenter la coupe à Jupiter que le jeune homme d'Ida, fit naufrage,\r\net confia à la mer de douces plaintes et des larmes d'amour; celle-ci\r\npleine de compassion les transmit aux feuilles qui répétant le triste\r\ngémissement du vent comme le doux instrument d'Arion----\" Here Sismondi\r\nbreaks off, for here Gongora becomes particularly obscure. We guess (it\r\nis all guessing with the _cultoristos_), that the poet intends to say,\r\nthat the pitying waves repeated to the winds the complaints of the\r\nwrecked youth, which in compassion tore from the pine the limb that\r\nserved him as a skiff to save him. Whether the instrument, soft as\r\nArion's, typifies the voice of the youth, or the waves, or the wind, or\r\nthe pine tree, is an enigma beyond our solving.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: This translation is from Mr. Wiffen, to show how simply\r\nand beautifully Gongora wrote in his young and unspoiled style, and we\r\ngive the Spanish of this last song:\r\n\r\n\"A UNA DAMA PRESENTANDOLA UNAS FLORES.\r\n\r\n\"De la florida falda\r\nque oy de perlas bordó la Alba luciente,\r\ntegidos en guirnalda,\r\ntraslado estos jazmines a tu frente,\r\nque piden con ser flores\r\nblanca a tus sienes, y a tu boca olores.\r\n\r\nGuarda destos jazmines\r\nde avejas era un esquadron volante,\r\nronco, si, de clarines,\r\nmas de puntas armado de diamante,\r\npuselas en huida\r\ny cada flor mi cuestra una herida.\r\n\r\nMas Clori que he texido\r\njazmines al cabello desatado,\r\ny mas besos te pido\r\nque avejas tuvo el esquadron armado,\r\nlisonjas son iguales,\r\nservir yo en flores, pagar tu en panales.\"\r\n\r\n_Obras de Gongora_, 1633.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108:  Discurso sobre la Nueva Poesia por Lope de Vega.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Lord Holland's Life of Lope de Vega.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: _Lop._ Sois vulgar o culterano?\r\n\r\n_Sev._ Culto soy.\r\n\r\n_Lop._ Quedaos en casa\r\nY escribireis mis secretos.\r\n\r\n_Sev._ Sus secretos! por que cansa?\r\n\r\n_Lop._ Porque nadie los entienda.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: \"Aquella que escribe en culto\r\npor a quel Griego lenguage;\r\nque no lo supo Castilla,\r\nni se enseñóle su madre.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: \"A UN PEYNE, QUE NO SABIA EL POETA SI ERA DE BOX\r\nO DE MARFIL.\r\n\r\n\"Sulca del mar de amor las rubias ondas,\r\nbarco de Barcelona, y por los bellos\r\nlazos navega altivo, aunque por ellos\r\ntal vez te muestres, y tal vez te escondas.\r\nYa no flechas, Amor, dorados ondas\r\nteje de sus esplendidos cabellos;\r\ntu con los dientes no lo quites dellos,\r\npara que a tanta dicha correspondas.\r\nDesenvuelve los rizos con decoro,\r\nlos paralelos de mi sol desata,\r\nbox o colmillo de elephante Moro,\r\ny en tanto que esparcidos los dilata\r\nforma por la madeja sendas de ora\r\nantes que el tiempo los convierta en plata.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: \"Era del año la estacion florida,\r\nen que el mentido robador de Europa\r\n(media Luna las armas de su frente,\r\ny el Sol todos los rayos de su pelo)\r\nluziente honor del cielo\r\nen campos de zafiro pace las estrellas,\r\nquando el que ministrar podia la copa\r\na Jupiter, mejor que el garçon de Ida\r\nnaufragò, y desdeñado sobre ausente\r\nlagrimosas de Amor, dulces querellas\r\nDá al mar, que condolido\r\nfue a las ondas, que al viento\r\nel misero gemido,\r\nsegundo de Arion dulce instrumento\r\ndel siempre en la montaña opuesto pino,\r\nal enemigo Noto\r\npiadoso miembro roto,\r\nbreve tabla, Delfin no fue pequeño\r\nal inconsiderado peregrino,\r\nque a una Libia de ondas su camino\r\nfio, y su vida a un leño\r\ndel oceano, pues antes sorvido\r\ny luego vomitado,\r\nno lexos de un escollo coronado\r\nde secos juncos, de calientes plumas,\r\n(Alga todo, y espumas)\r\nhallò hospitalidad donde hallò nido\r\nde Jupiter el ave,\r\nbesa la arena, y de la reta nave\r\naquella parte poca\r\nque lo expuso en la playa, dio a la roca,\r\nque aun se dexan las peñas\r\nlisongear de agradecidas señas,\r\ndesnudo el joven, quanto ya el vestido\r\noceano ha bevido\r\nrestituir le haze a las arenas,\r\ny al sol lo estiende luego,\r\nque lamiendolo apenas\r\nsu dulce lengua de templado fuego\r\nlento lo embiste, y con suave estilo\r\nla menor honda chupa al menor hilo.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEVEDO\r\n\r\n1580-1645.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpaniards may look back with pride to this epoch, so fertile in genius,\r\nso prolific of the talent and high character that germinates in the\r\nSpanish soul, and which it required unexampled despotism and cruelty to\r\ncrush and efface. Not that the inborn greatness of that people is lost,\r\nbut its outward demonstration, after this period, became the unheard and\r\nsightless prey of political oppression. The words of Gray, wherein he\r\nspeaks of the heroes and poets who may have been born and died without\r\nachieving distinction, or performing any act capable of winning it, is\r\nso true, perhaps, in no country as in Spain: but with them it cannot be\r\nsaid, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Chill penury repressed their noble rage,\r\nAnd froze the genial current of the soul.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the stake and the dungeon, a system of misrule, and the aspect of\r\nthe merciless deeds committed by their governors on helpless multitudes,\r\nthat destroyed the energies, and blighted the genius, of the people.\r\nWhen we read of such acts as the banishment of the Moriscos, and the\r\nhistory of all that high-hearted people suffered--torn from their\r\nnative vales and hills, and cast out upon the stranger--we wonder what\r\nmanner of men lived in Spain, and feel that these inhuman and impious\r\ndeeds must have poisoned the very air. But, politically speaking, it is\r\nnot the act, but its effects, that are so baneful; national crime\r\ninfluences by causing the degeneracy of the race. The youth may live a\r\nlife of sin; it is the man that is the sufferer. And thus the heroes of\r\nSpain of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, might glory in their\r\nchildren of the sixteenth; but the infection of evil had touched these,\r\nand their descendants made good the awful denunciation,--that the\r\nchildren are to suffer for their parents' crimes--an annunciation of\r\ndivine will, so carried out in the vast system of the world, though\r\noften omitted in particular instances, as to demonstrate that it is one\r\nof the laws bestowed by heaven to govern the human race.\r\n\r\nAmong the men who, last of the Spaniards of renown, flourished at that\r\nepoch, Quevedo deserves particular mention. He was a man of genius--a\r\nman who acted as well as wrote, and displayed in both originality,\r\npenetration and rectitude; whose character was as admirable as his\r\nintellect. He was the victim, also, of the most frightful misrule; and\r\nthe fate of Quevedo alone might be brought forward as an example of the\r\ninfamy of the political institutions of Spain.\r\n\r\nDon Francisco Gomez de Quevedo Villegas, was born at Madrid in September\r\n1580. His father, Pedro Gomez de Quevedo, was a courtier. He had been\r\nsecretary to the empress Mary, and afterwards filled the same situation\r\nto queen Anne, wife of Philip II. His mother, donna Maria de Santibanez,\r\nalso was attached to the court, and was a lady of the bedchamber to the\r\nqueen. They were both of noble family, and descended from the most\r\nancient landed proprietors of the Montana, in the Valle de Toranzo.\r\n\r\nHis father died when he was a child; and he was brought up in the royal\r\npalace by his mother, but she also died when he was young[114], as we\r\ngather from one of his ballads, in which he gives a jocosely bitter\r\naccount of the ill luck that pursued him through life. He went early to\r\nthe university of Alcalà, and there his passion for study developed\r\nitself in all its intensity, so that we are told that he took his degree\r\nin theology, to the wonder of every body, at fifteen. This seems almost\r\nincredible; but it is plain he took it with credit, and a the expense of\r\ngreat labour.\r\n\r\nThis science and success, however, did not satisfy him. He gave himself\r\neagerly up to the acquirement of other knowledge: civil and canon law,\r\nmedicine and natural history, the learned languages, and the various\r\nsystems of philosophy, were in the number of his studies and\r\nacquirements: poetry was added to the list. His grasping and clear mind\r\nbecame informed by all the learning of the times; it converted it all to\r\nnutriment, and acquired power from the various intellectual weapons he\r\ntaught himself to wield.\r\n\r\nHis career was checked by a circumstance that may rather be looked on as\r\nfortunate, since it forced him to quit the immediate atmosphere of the\r\ncourt, and to make his way elsewhere, through his own exertions and\r\nmerits. He was, though so young, held in high esteem for his conduct,\r\nand, as the most accomplished cavalier of his time, was often made the\r\narbitrator of quarrels: in which character he displayed his good sense\r\nand good feeling by the care he at once took, to watch over the point of\r\nhonour and to reconcile adversaries. He himself wielded all weapons of\r\ndefence with singular dexterity; though, being born with both his feet\r\nturned in, this deformity must have impeded the full developement of his\r\npowers, which, nevertheless, exceeded those of most men in strength and\r\nskill, and were aided by his bravery and greatness of mind. These\r\nqualifications had brought him off the conqueror in several unexpected\r\nand inevitable rencontres, where he had been obliged to defend or assert\r\nhimself. On one occasion a man, calling himself a gentleman, entirely\r\nunknown to him, took advantage of the darkness in which churches are\r\nplunged during the evening of Holy Thursday, to insult a lady (equally\r\nunknown to Quevedo), in the church of St. Martin, at Madrid. Quevedo\r\ncame forward to her assistance, forced the insulter into the street,\r\nand, reproving him for his brutality, they drew on each other, and\r\nQuevedo ran his adversary through the body. The friends of the cavalier\r\nendeavoured to seize him, and he was obliged to fly: he took refuge in\r\nItaly, and thence, invited by the viceroy, repaired to Sicily.\r\n\r\nAt this time Don Pedro Giron, duke of Osuna and grandee of Spain, was\r\nviceroy of Sicily. He was a man of singular character; and the career he\r\nran, in which Quevedo was involved, was as strange and various as was\r\nhis disposition and designs.[115] The character of the Spanish, under\r\nthe gloomy influence of Philip II., had become dignified, grave and\r\nceremonious. His son Philip III. was of a different character. His\r\nfather had taken pains to inculcate all his own bigotry in matters of\r\nreligion, and, at the same time, to inspire him with application,\r\njudgment, and a knowledge of the arts of government. In the first part\r\nof his education he succeeded; in the latter he wholly failed. Philip\r\nIII. was a weak prince and as such given up to favouritism. On coming to\r\nthe crown, he devolved all the labours of government on the marquis of\r\nDenia whom he made duke of Lerma, who again entrusted much of the royal\r\npatronage and power to Don Rodrigo de Calderon, a man of low birth, but\r\nof high and haughty mind, who became count of Oliva and marquis de Siete\r\nIglesias. The court of Philip III., however, preserved much of the\r\ndignity, the severe etiquette and solemn gravity brought in by Philip\r\nII. In this serious and ceremonious circle the duke of Osuna was almost\r\nregarded as a madman. He displayed the fervour and spirit of youth in a\r\ngaiety and recklessness of manner and behaviour, wholly at war with\r\ncourtly decorum and seriousness. His wit was brilliant, his\r\nunderstanding penetrating, his imagination full of fire and\r\nextravagance; his temper ardent and joyous. He was often called insane,\r\nand the sober tried to bring him into disesteem. His high birth and vast\r\nfortunes, however, gave him rank and weight, and he had distinguished\r\nhimself in the wars of the Low Countries, not only by his bravery but by\r\nhis military skill. His disposition prompted him to love the trade of\r\nwar; and he made such use of his experience during the struggle carried\r\non in that disturbed country, that he became reputed fit to command an\r\narmy. His valour was undoubted; on one occasion he had three horses\r\nkilled under him, and the success that attended his enterprises\r\nsurrounded them with still greater lustre. He was licentious in his\r\nhabits, but so grossly so, that he was never the slave of love. His\r\nambition was unbounded; his designs vast: his imagination suggested a\r\nthousand strange modes of satisfying it, and engendered schemes so wild\r\nand daring that, while the world was amazed, and its repose disturbed,\r\ntheir very singularity, in many instances, commanded success. His\r\nmilitary reputation was the cause, joined to the influence of Uzeda, son\r\nof the duke of Lerma, who was his friend, that, notwithstanding his\r\nindiscretions and levity, he came to be named viceroy of Sicily.\r\n\r\nQuevedo was an invaluable acquisition to such a man. His gaiety and wit\r\nrecommended him as a companion: his understanding, his integrity, his\r\nelevated character, his resolution, his capacity for labour, and his\r\ngreat knowledge, caused him to be a useful servant to one, whose vast\r\ndesigns required instruments of power and skill. The duke showed his\r\ngreat confidence in his talents and fidelity by sending him as his\r\nambassador to Madrid, to recount his exploits and explain his designs.\r\nQuevedo succeeded so well that, the king and council bestowed a pension\r\non him, and the duke of Osuna was advanced to the viceroyalty of\r\nNaples--which opened a new scene for his schemes and a wide field for\r\nhis towering ambition. Osuna's first acts were directed against the\r\nTurkish power, and he obtained several splendid victories in the\r\nMediterranean and on the coasts of Africa, but he had designs more at\r\nheart than a victory over the Turks. The war of the Low Countries was\r\nconcluded, and there was peace between France and Spain. The Spanish\r\npower, possessed of Sicily and Naples and Milan, threatened to become\r\nomnipotent in Italy. Charles Emanuel, duke of Savoy, a gallant and\r\npatriotic prince in vain endeavoured to make head against it: he was\r\nforced to submit. Still in heart he was at war; and this sovereign and\r\nthe republic of Venice made a quiet but determined stand against the\r\nencroachments of Spain in Italy. The Duke of Osuna set himself in\r\nopposition to them, and, in particular, used every means he could\r\ncommand, to weaken and injure the Venetians.\r\n\r\nThe methods he took were lawless and dishonourable, but they shewed his\r\ndespotic and daring spirit. He encouraged the Uscocchi, a tribe of\r\npirates who inhabited Istria, and infested the Mediterranean. A Spanish\r\nfleet protected their attacks on the Venetians, intercepted the forces\r\nof the republic sent against them, and seized upon their merchantmen in\r\nthe Adriatic. Corsairs and pirates of all nations brought their prizes\r\nto the ports of Naples, and found shelter and protection: they were\r\npermitted to trade; and Osuna thus gathered together a number of\r\ndesperate men whom he could use in the execution of any daring\r\nenterprise. The fair traders and merchants of Naples however, finding\r\ncommerce decline, complained at the court of Madrid; the French also\r\nmade representations against the nefarious acts of the pirates protected\r\nby Osuna; and the court, which had entered on a treaty of peace with\r\nSavoy, and was negotiating one between Venice and Ferdinand of Austria,\r\nsent an order to the viceroy to suspend all hostilities.\r\n\r\nOsuna would not obey. He sent a fleet into the Adriatic, and threatened\r\nwith death any one who should dare carry complaints to Madrid. His\r\npretence was the alarm of an intended invasion by the Turks, while at\r\nthe same time he was endeavouring to induce the Porte to attack Candia.\r\nThis fleet was driven into port by a storm: but he had a number of\r\nprivateers which, notwithstanding Spain was at peace with Venice,\r\ncaptured the vessels of that state; and, when he was ordered to restore\r\nthem, he obeyed by sending back the vessels and keeping the cargoes. In\r\nvain did the Venetians complain. Osuna declared that he would persist\r\nwhile he detected latent enmity to Spain in the councils of the\r\nrepublic, and the Spanish ambassador was forced to allow that the\r\nviceroy was beyond royal control.\r\n\r\nBut his designs did not end here; his heart was set on the destruction\r\nof Venice: and, his daring and uncontrolled imagination suggesting the\r\nwildest schemes, he set on foot another attempt even less venial than\r\nhis encouragement of the Uscocchi. It is true that Spanish historians,\r\nand, among them, Ortiz, deny the complicity of Spain in the conspiracy\r\nformed against Venice, and throw upon the Venetian senate the accusation\r\nof trumping up a plot, for the sake of getting rid of the Spanish\r\nambassador: but all other nations concur in believing the conspiracy to\r\nhave been real, and in affirming that the interesting account Saint Real\r\ngives, is, in the main, founded on undoubted facts.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Bedmar conspiracy against Venice is familiar to us\r\nthrough Otway's play. This is not the place to go into minute detail.\r\nThe marquis of Bedmar was a man of great talent and acquirements. The\r\nSpanish government held him in high esteem; he was sagacious and\r\ndiscerning, and he had that zeal for the glory of his country, which in\r\nthat day distinguished the Spaniards: and it was of the first importance\r\nto the prosperity of Spain to weaken, how much more to destroy the state\r\nof Venice. His design was to introduce foreign troops surreptitiously\r\ninto the town--to fire the arsenal and other parts of the city, and to\r\nseize on its places of strength. The senators were to be massacred; and\r\nif the citizens offered resistance, artillery was to be turned on them,\r\nand the city laid in ruins. The plot was discovered: it is not known\r\nexactly how. It seems probable, that a conspirator, a Venetian, a\r\nJaffier, betrayed it through the suggestions of fear or humanity, and\r\nVenice was preserved.\r\n\r\nBedmar, it is said, communicated his plot to Osuna, and they acted in\r\nconcert. There can be no doubt, but that both ministers were zealously\r\nbent on weakening the power of Venice; and, as there appears ample proof\r\nthat this conspiracy originated in the marquis of Bedmar, so is it also\r\nprobable that he associated in it a spirit so lawless, a man so bold and\r\nresolute as Osuna. Quevedo was the emissary that passed between them,\r\nand if Osuna was privy to the plot, it seems certain that Quevedo also\r\nwas.\r\n[Sidenote: 1618.\r\nÆtat.\r\n38.]\r\nThis is a painful circumstance. We hear so much of the integrity and\r\nexcellence of Quevedo's character, that we are averse to believe his\r\ncomplicity in the nefarious attempt to destroy a rival state, not by the\r\nfair advantages of war, but by conspiracy, incendiarism, and massacre;\r\nthat state also not only being at peace, but the plot originating in,\r\nand carried on by one who bore the sacred character of an ambassador.\r\nBut, nurtured under the poisonous influence of the Inquisition, fraught\r\nwith a zeal, which does not deserve the name of patriotic, since the\r\ntrue honour of their country was not consulted, the Spaniards nourished\r\na false conscience; and the men who could serve God by the murder of the\r\ninnocent and helpless, could serve their king by perjury and\r\nassassination. During his various political services the life of Quevedo\r\nhad been several times attempted, and this also might tend to blunt his\r\nsense of right: he might fancy that it was but fair retaliation to use\r\ntowards others the secret weapon levelled against himself. However this\r\nmay be, whether or not he were acquainted with the secret of the\r\nconspiracy, and took a part in it, it is certain that he was in Venice\r\nat the time that the plot was discovered. Many of his intimate friends\r\nwere seized and perished by the hands of the executioner; but he\r\ncontrived to elude the vigilance of the senate, and finally made his\r\nescape in the guise of a mendicant.\r\n\r\nOsuna continued viceroy of Naples, and it began to be suspected that he\r\nintended to arrogate power independent of the king his master. His\r\nsuccess at sea against Venice raised him many enemies, as he gained it\r\nthrough the destruction of all fair trade, and also by the imposition of\r\nvast and burthensome taxes. The Neapolitan nobility were, in a body,\r\ninimical to him; and all those disaffected to the Spanish rule made him\r\nthe apparent object of their hatred and complaints. He, aware of their\r\naversion, endeavoured to crush them; he visited all those crimes\r\nseverely which they had hitherto, under shadow of their rank, committed\r\nunpunished. He excluded them from all offices of power and trust, and\r\ntook occasion when he could, to confiscate their property. He encouraged\r\na spirit of sedition among the common people; he surrounded himself by\r\nforeign troops; he encouraged men of desperate fortunes--he commanded\r\nthe sea--and his power became unbounded. He utterly despised the king\r\nhis master, calling him the great drum of the monarchy, as if he had\r\nbeen a mere tool and instrument, and possessed no real authority.\r\n\r\nWith all this it is not probable that he really conspired to seize on\r\nNaples. He wished to rule absolutely and unquestioned, but did not go\r\nbeyond into forming designs of putting his power on a new and\r\nindependent foundation. His wild projecting brain was well known, and\r\ncaused many of his acts to pass unnoticed; but his enemies increased,\r\nand their complaints at court were frequent. They fabricated accusations\r\nto his dishonour, exaggerated his weaknesses and faults, and combined\r\ntogether for his overthrow. Finding that he became aware of their\r\nattempts, they, fearful of his revenge, renewed them with increased\r\nfervour. Men of the highest rank in Naples visited Madrid, and put\r\nthemselves forward to misinterpret his actions. They art-fully\r\nrepresented that the ruin of commerce, and the desolation of the kingdom\r\narose from his dissolute life and misrule. The king and his ministers\r\ngave ear to these representations, and commanded Osuna to return to\r\nMadrid. This was a great blow to the duke: though he received it with\r\napparent constancy, he neither liked to lose his place, nor, above all,\r\nto lose it under dishonourable imputations, and he delayed obedience.\r\nThus colour was given to the idea that he meant to assert his\r\nindependence. The court of Madrid, therefore, proceeded more warily:\r\nthey contrived to get possession of his galleys and other vessels of\r\nwar; and orders were despatched to cardinal don Gaspar de Borgia, who\r\nwas named his successor, to proceed instantly from Rome, where he was\r\nresiding, to Naples, and to seize on the government. Borgia arrived at\r\nGaëta, but still Osuna protracted his stay under various pretences. The\r\nnobles represented that he was endeavouring to raise an insurrection\r\namong the populace and soldiers; and Borgia, to put an end to the\r\nstruggle, having gained the support of the governor of the Castel Nuovo,\r\nintroduced himself into that fortress by night. The following morning\r\nthe discharge of artillery proclaimed his arrival, and Osuna was obliged\r\nto submit. He returned by slow journies to Spain. He presented himself\r\nat court, and the king turned his back on him. Osuna eyed his sovereign\r\nwith contempt, muttering, \"The king treats me not as a man, but as a\r\nchild.\" Not long after, Philip III. died. The enemies of Osuna were not\r\nidle; fresh accusations of his treasonable intents at Naples were\r\nperpetually made; and one of the first acts of the reign of Philip IV.\r\nwas to throw him into prison. The distress of his mind increased the\r\ndisease of which he was the victim, and he died in prison of a dropsy,\r\nin the year 1624.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1620.\r\nÆtat.\r\n40.]\r\n\r\nQuevedo was enveloped in his ruin. He had been a zealous and laborious\r\nservant to Osuna and to his government. He had, by his attention to the\r\nfinances discovered various frauds, and brought large sums into the\r\ntreasury. He crossed the sea seven times as ambassador to the court of\r\nMadrid, and fulfilled the same employment at Rome. He had been rewarded\r\nby the gift of the habit of Santiago. He loved and revered Osuna, and\r\ntestified his attachment by writing several sonnets in his honour. One\r\nis on his death, in which he says, \"The fields of Flanders are his\r\nmonument--the blood-stained Crescent his epitaph: Spain gave him a\r\nprison and death; but though his country failed him, his deeds were his\r\ndefence.\"[116] He wrote three other sonnets as epitaphs[117]: Ortiz\r\nmentions them as containing an epitome of the duke's life. He says of\r\nhim that he was \"The terror of Asia, the fear of Europe, and the\r\nthunder-bolt of Africa. His name alone was victory, there where the\r\nCrescent ruled. He divorced Venice and the Sea.\" In another he sums up\r\nhis achievements against the Turks:--\"He liberated a thousand Christians\r\nfrom the galleys; he assaulted and sacked Goletta, Chicheri, and\r\nCalivia: the Danube, and Moselle and the Rhine paled before his armies.\"\r\nThe fall of Osuna included his own. There can be no doubt that he was\r\ninnocent of all participation in any treasonable designs of the viceroy,\r\nbut innocence was a slight resource in Spain against powerful accusers.\r\nHe was arrested and carried to his villa of Torre de Juan Abad, and\r\nimprisoned there for three years and a half. He was confined with such\r\nrigour, that in default of medical aid he fell severely ill, so that he\r\nwrote to the president of the council, to represent the miserable state\r\nof his health, and obtained leave to attend to his cure in the\r\nneighbouring city of Villa Nueva de los Infantes. A few months after he\r\nwas liberated, under the restriction that he was not to appear at court.\r\nBut the total absence of all proof against him, caused this sentence to\r\nbe taken off soon after. Unfortunately he was not satisfied with freedom\r\nfrom persecution. His fortunes had suffered during his imprisonment, and\r\nhe sought to mend them by claiming the arrears of his pension, the\r\npayment of which had been suspended during his disgrace. This lighted\r\nagain the fire of persecution, and he was again exiled, and retired to\r\nhis villa of Torre Juan Abad, till after the lapse of another year he\r\nwas allowed to return to Madrid. No longer persecuted, and restored to\r\nhis proper place in society, he resided for some time at court, where he\r\nenjoyed the reputation his talents, prudence, and conduct commanded, so\r\nthat the king, to reward his services, and compensate for his\r\nsufferings, named him one of his secretaries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1632.\r\nÆtat.\r\n52.]\r\n\r\nBut such honours had ceased to charm Quevedo. Misfortune and disgrace\r\nhad taught him to look with aversion on public employments; his long\r\nimprisonment had accustomed him to study, and engendered a love of\r\ntranquillity. Several places were offered him by the count-duke\r\nOlivarez, minister and favourite of Philip IV., such as minister for\r\nstate despatches, and the embassy to Genoa, but he declined them and\r\ngave himself up to study and philosophy. His writings were many, and\r\ngained for him a high reputation; he was in correspondence with all the\r\nmost learned men of Europe, and was enriched by the revenue of several\r\nbenefices; thus for several years he enjoyed reputation and prosperity.\r\n[Sidenote: 1634.\r\nÆtat.\r\n54.]\r\nHe gave up, however, his church preferments for the sake of marrying.\r\nHis wife was donna Esperanza de Aragon y la Cabra, Señora of Cetina,\r\nand she belonged to one of the highest families in the kingdom. With her\r\nhe retired to Cetina; but he was not long allowed to enjoy the happiness\r\nhe promised himself: his wife died within a few months, and this last\r\nmisfortune, destroying the fabric of felicity he had erected, and\r\ncounted upon possessing to the end of his life, was the heaviest blow of\r\nall. His resource and consolation was retirement and study. He took up\r\nhis abode at Torre Juan Abad, and gave himself up to the cultivation of\r\nliterature and poetry.\r\n\r\nSeveral of his poems are expressive of the delight he felt at leaving\r\nMadrid for the solitude of his villa which was placed in the Sierra of\r\nLa Mancha. One of his romances describes his progress from Madrid\r\nthrough Toledo, la Mancha, and the Sierra, to his estate: the poem is\r\nburlesque, and in ridicule of all he sees; but there are others in which\r\nhe dwells with satisfaction on his tranquil occupations. \"Retired to the\r\nsolitude of these deserts,\" he writes, \"with few but wise books, I enjoy\r\nthe conversation of the dead, and with my eyes listen to those who are\r\nno more. The press gives into our hands those great souls whom death has\r\nfreed from injury. The hour takes its irrevocable Sight, but that is\r\nspent best which improves us by reading and study.\"[118]\r\n\r\nHe was an excellent landlord, and a kind master; he exerted himself in\r\nacts of charity towards his vassals, and conducted himself with\r\nChristian humility and mercy. For a few years he was permitted to enjoy\r\nthis tranquillity; it was a sort of calm after storm, where the absence\r\nof sorrow is called happiness. His active mind furnished him with\r\noccupation, while his piety and philosophy taught him content. He might\r\nnow hope that he was assured of such a state of peace to the end of his\r\nlife,--for he had relinquished every ambitious project, and limited his\r\nviews to the narrowed sphere immediately around him. But Quevedo was one\r\nof those men marked by destiny for misfortune. He playfully, and yet\r\nwith some bitterness, alludes to his evil fate, in a poem before quoted.\r\nHe says: \"My fortunes are so black, they might serve me for ink: I might\r\nbe used as an image of a saint;--for, if the country people want rain,\r\nthey have but to turn me out naked, and they are sure of a deluge; if\r\nthey want sun, let me be covered by a mantle, and it will shine at\r\nnight; I am always mistaken for some object of vengeance, and receive\r\nthe blows intended for another. If a tile is to fall, it waits till I\r\npass under. If I wish to borrow from any one, he replies so rudely,\r\nthat, instead of borrowing, I am obliged to lend my patience. Every fool\r\nprates to me; every old woman makes love; every poor person begs; every\r\nprosperous one takes offence. When I travel, I always miss my road; when\r\nI play, I always lose; every friend deceives, every enemy sticks to me;\r\nwater fails me at sea,--in taverns I find it in plenty, mingled with my\r\nwine. I have given up all employments, for I know that if I turned\r\nhosier, people would go bare-legged; if physician, no one would fall\r\nill. If I am gallant towards a woman, she listens to or refuses\r\nme,--both are equally disastrous. If a man wished to die neither by\r\npoison nor pestilence, he has but to intend to benefit me, and he will\r\nnot live an hour. Such is the adverseness of my star, that I submit and\r\ntry to propitiate its pride by my adoration.\"[119]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1641.\r\nÆtat.\r\n61.]\r\n\r\nBut worse luck was in store for him, and a misfortune so heavy, as to\r\nput an end to his life, after exhausting him by suffering. He was\r\nsuspected of being the author of certain libels against the court, and\r\nto the injury of public morals;--and an accusation was brought against\r\nhim, either by some malicious enemy, or officious and mistaken medler.\r\nHappening to visit Madrid for some cause, and being in the house of a\r\ngrandee, his friend, he was arrested at eleven at night, in the month of\r\nDecember 1641, and imprisoned in a dungeon of the royal Casa de San\r\nMarcos de Leon, and his possessions seized on. His confinement was cruel\r\nas well as rigorous,--his dungeon was damp;--a stream flowed through it\r\nclose to his pillow. He was allowed no money, and lived by charity; his\r\nclothes became rags, and he could not renew them. This frightful\r\nsituation produced sores on his body, and not being allowed medical aid,\r\nhe was forced to dress them himself.\r\n\r\nThere are two letters of his extant, written in prison,--one addressed\r\nto a friend,--the other, a memorial to the count-duke Olivarez,\r\nsoliciting inquiry into his case.[120] These letters are far less\r\ninteresting than might have been expected from so vivid a writer as\r\nQuevedo, describing the squalid wretchedness of a dungeon, and the\r\nhorrors of his lot; but they are curious monuments of the manners of the\r\nday, shewing how men endured the evils of misrule, and evincing the\r\nresignation and dignity Quevedo could preserve throughout.\r\n\r\nThe first is addressed to a gentleman whom his biographers name his\r\nintimate friend, don Diego de Villagomez, a cavalier of the city of\r\nLeon; but the style is as cold and ceremonious as if written to an\r\narchbishop. It begins by saying:--\"I who am a warning write to you who\r\nare an example to the world,--but different as we are, we both travel to\r\nthe same end,--and adversity has this of good, that it serves as a\r\nlesson to others. Even in learning the military profession, you have\r\nshewn yourself a good captain. For you have not left it, but attained\r\npreferment. War endures to all men through life, for life is war; and to\r\nlive and to struggle is the same thing.\"--He then makes a religious\r\napplication of this maxim, saying, that to leave a worldly service for\r\nthat of Jesus, is to follow a better banner and to be assured of the\r\npay; and, after a long disquisition on this subject, and in praise of\r\nSt. Ignatius, he concludes by saying: \"I can count, señor don Diego,\r\nfourteen years and a half of imprisonment, and may add to this the\r\nmisery of this last dungeon, in which, I count the wages of my sins.\r\nGive me pity in exchange for the envy I bear you; and since God gives\r\nyou better society, enjoy it, far from the solitude of your friend, who\r\nlies in the grasp of persecution, far short in his account, though he\r\npays much less than he owes. And may God give you his grace and\r\nbenediction. From prison, the 8th of June, 1643.\"\r\n\r\nThe memorial to the count-duke is far more to the purpose, but, even\r\nthat is very diffuse and pedantic, though the facts he details were\r\nimpressive enough to obtain compassion without quotations from the\r\nancients; but such was the tone of that age.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" he writes, \"a year and ten months have passed since I was\r\nthrown into prison, on the seventh of December, on the eve of the\r\nConception of our Lady, at half-past ten at night; when I was dragged in\r\nthe depth of winter, without a cloak, and without a shirt, in my\r\nsixty-first year, to this royal convent of San Marcos de Leon; where I\r\nhave remained all the time mentioned, in most rigorous confinement; sick\r\nwith three wounds, which have festered through the effects of cold, and\r\nthe vicinity of a stream that flow's near my pillow; and not being\r\nallowed a surgeon, it has been a sight of pity to see me cauterise them\r\nwith my own hands. I am so poor that I have been clothed, and my life\r\nsupported by charity. The horror of my hardships has struck every one\r\nwith dread. I have only one sister, a nun among the barefooted\r\nCarmelites, from whom I can hope nothing, but that she should recommend\r\nme to God. I acknowledge (for so my sins persuade) mercy in this\r\ncruelty. For I am myself the voice of my conscience, and I accuse my\r\nlife. If your Excellency found me well off, mine would be the praise. To\r\nfind me miserable, and to do me good, makes the praise yours; and if I\r\nam unworthy of pity, your Excellency is worthy to feel it, and it is the\r\nappropriate virtue of so great a noble and minister. 'There is nothing,'\r\nsays Seneca, when consoling Marcia, 'that I consider so meritorious in\r\nthose who hold a high station, as the pardoning many things, and seeking\r\npardon for none.' What worse crime can I commit, than persuading myself\r\nthat my misfortunes are to be the limit of your magnanimity? I ask time\r\nfrom your Excellency to revenge myself on myself. The world has already\r\nheard what my enemies can say against me; I desire now that they should\r\nhear me against myself, and my accusations will be the more true from\r\nbeing exempt from hatred. I protest, before God, our Lord, that in all\r\nthat is said of me, I am guilty of no other crime, than not having lived\r\nan exemplary life, so that my sins may be attributed to my folly. Those\r\nwho see me, do not believe that I am a prisoner on suspicion, but under\r\na most rigorous sentence; wherefore I do not expect death, but live in\r\ncommunion with it. I exist only through its generosity,--and I am a\r\ncorpse in all except the sepulture, which is the repose of the dead. I\r\nhave lost every thing. My possessions, which were always trifling, are\r\nreduced to nothing, between the great expenses of my imprisonment, and\r\nthe losses it has occasioned. My friends are frightened by my calamity,\r\nand nothing remains to me but my trust in you. No mercy can bestow many\r\nyears on me, nor any cruelty deprive me of many. I do not, my lord, seek\r\nthis interval, naturally so short, for the sake of living longer, but of\r\nliving well for a little while.\"\r\n\r\nHe then sums up, by quoting Pliny and Trajan on the merits of mercy, and\r\nthe preferability of being loved rather than feared.\r\n\r\nThis memorial had the effect of drawing attention to his cause and\r\nsufferings. The accusation on account of which he was imprisoned was\r\nexamined, and it was discovered that he had been calumniated, and the\r\nreal author of the libel came to be known; on this he was set at\r\nliberty, and allowed to return to court. His first labour was to recover\r\nhis property, the whole of which, except the portion he had entrusted to\r\nhis powerful friend, doctor Francisco de Oviedo, had been sequestered.\r\nIt was a work of difficulty; and, meanwhile, he found himself too poor\r\nto live with becoming respectability at court, so he retired to his\r\ncountry seat. Here he soon fell ill from the effects of neglect during\r\nhis last, long, and cruel imprisonment; and he was obliged to remove to\r\nVilla Nueva de los Infantes, for the sake of medical treatment. He was\r\nlong confined to his apartment, suffering great pain and annoyance, all\r\nof which he endured with exemplary patience. He made his will, and\r\nprepared his soul for death. He named his nephew his successor, on\r\ncondition that he took the name of Quevedo. His death was lingering. To\r\nthe last he displayed fortitude and a tranquil spirit of resignation. He\r\ndied the 8th of September, 1647, at the age of sixty-five.\r\n\r\nIn person, Quevedo was of middle height, and robust, though his feet\r\nwere deformed. He was handsome in face, fair, and with curly hair\r\ninclined to red. He was short-sighted--but his countenance was full of\r\nanimation. Notwithstanding his deformity, he was vigorous,--addicted to,\r\nand excelling in, manly exercises.\r\n\r\nHis life was spent in a series of vicissitudes; at one time enjoying\r\npower and reputation; at another, a prisoner, suffering all the evils of\r\npoverty and neglect. He bore all with fortitude: his active mind gave\r\nhim employment, his genius caused him to find a resource in\r\nwriting;--and the vivacity and energy of his works display the unabated\r\nvigour of his soul. Nearly fifteen years of his life he spent in prison,\r\nas he mentions in his letter above quoted. Meanwhile his character\r\nremained uninjured by adversity. His disposition was magnanimous, so\r\nthat he never revenged himself on any of his enemies: he was generous\r\nand charitable to those in need; and so diffident of his own merit, that\r\nthe only poems he published saw light under a feigned name.\r\n\r\nHis integrity had been put to the proof at Naples, where bribes were\r\noffered him to conceal the frauds practised on the royal revenue; but he\r\nwas far above dishonesty and peculation. The only slur on his character\r\nis his possible complicity in the Bedmar conspiracy; but in those days\r\nthe advantage of the state to which a man belonged was deemed\r\npreponderant to all the suggestions of justice and right. Quevedo also\r\nacted on this occasion (if he did act) under the command of his\r\nsuperiors; and believed that fidelity to his patron was his first duty.\r\n\r\nOf his \"Affaires du Cœur,\" the great subject with poets, we know\r\nlittle. Several ladies are celebrated in his verses; but a great\r\nproportion of his erotic poetry is dedicated to one, whom he names Lisi,\r\nand to whom he appears to have been faithfully attached for a\r\nconsiderable space of time. In one of his sonnets to her, he says that\r\nten years had taken their swift and noiseless flight since first he saw\r\nher; and for these ten years the soft flame had warmed his veins, and\r\nreigned over his soul; \"for the flame,\" he says, \"that aspires to\r\nimmortal life, neither fears to die with the body, nor that time should\r\ninjure or extinguish it.\" Many of his poems express great aversion to\r\nmatrimony, and when, at last, in advanced age, he did marry, we have\r\nseen that he was widowed almost as soon as wed.\r\n\r\nWith the never-to-be-omitted exception of Cervantes, Quevedo is the most\r\noriginal prose writer Spain has produced; but at the same time he is so\r\nquaint, referring to local peculiarities, and using words unknown,\r\nexcept colloquially, that he is often unintelligible, especially in his\r\nburlesque poetry, to a foreigner. His countrymen esteem him highly. One\r\nof the most pleasing stanzas of Lope de Vega's Laurel de Apolo is\r\ndedicated to his praise. He speaks of him as \"Possessing an acute but\r\ngentle spirit; agreeable in his wit, and profound in his serious\r\npoetry.\" He adopted something of the _culto_ style and conceits blemish\r\nhis verses. Quintana says of him, \"Quevedo was every thing in excess; no\r\none in the same manner displays in the serious, a gravity so rigid, and\r\nmorals so austere; no one in the jocose, shows a humour, so gay, so\r\nfree, and so abandoned to the spirit of the thing. His imagination was\r\nvivid and brilliant but superficial and negligent; and the poetic genius\r\nthat animates him, sparkles but does not glow, surprises but does not\r\nmove deeply, bounds with impetuosity and force, but neither flies nor\r\nsupports itself at the same elevation. I am well aware that Quevedo\r\noften diverts with what he writes, and raves because it is his pleasure.\r\nI know that puns have their proper place in such compositions, and that\r\nno one has used them more happily than he. But every thing has its\r\nbounds; and heaped together with a prodigality like his, instead of\r\npleasing they only create weariness.\r\n\r\n\"His verse, however, is for the most part full and sonorous, his rhyme\r\nrich and easy. His poetry, strong and nervous, proceeds impetuously to\r\nits end; and if his movements betray too much of the effort, affectation\r\nand bad taste of the writer, their course is yet frequently seen to have\r\na wildness, an audacity, and a singularity hat is surprising.[121]\"\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of Quevedo's style to the English reader we may liken\r\nhim to Butler; but it is Butler rather in his fragments than in\r\nHudibras, for a more elevated poetic tone is displayed in those. Quevedo\r\ncould be sublime, though only by snatches. Serious he could be, to the\r\ndepths of grave and profound disquisition, as his ethical and religious\r\ntreatises testify.\r\n\r\nOne singular circumstance appertains to Quevedo's literary career--that\r\nhe published none of his poetry himself, except that portion which he\r\ngave to the world under the feigned name of the Bachiller Francisco de\r\nla Torre. These are the choice of all. Being more elevated, more sweet,\r\nmore pure in their diction and taste, several critics would deprive\r\nQuevedo of the merit of being their author. But who Torre was, if he\r\nwere not Quevedo, nobody can tell: while, these poems appearing under\r\nhis editorship, and the very name--Francisco being his own, and the\r\nsurname, \"of the Tower,\" appropriate to his position, as the verses were\r\nwritten while he was living secluded in his patrimonial villa of Torre\r\nJuan Abaci, seems to fix them unquestionably on him. Of the rest, a\r\nfriend of Quevedo assures us that not a twentieth part of what he wrote\r\nhas escaped destruction. His dramas and historical works have perished;\r\nby which he has lost the right to being considered the universal writer\r\nhis contemporaries name him. This friend, and afterwards his nephew and\r\nheir, published his poems, distributed under the head of six muses,\r\npedantically headed with mottos from Seneca. There is Clio the historic,\r\nconsisting chiefly of sonnets on great events addressed to great people;\r\nPolyhimnia the sententious; Melpomene, composed chiefly of epitaphs;\r\nErato the erotic, or as it is styled, \"singing of the achievements of\r\nlove and beauty:\" the greater part of which is dedicated to Lisi.\r\nTerpsichore the light, gay and satirical, a large portion of which are\r\nwritten in the jargon of the gypsies, and are unintelligible on this\r\nside of the Pyrenees; and Thalia, longest of all, which sings, \"de\r\nomnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis.\"\r\n\r\nIt is as a prose writer, however, that Quevedo has acquired fame out of\r\nhis own country. And this not from his serious works; nor from his\r\n\"picaresco,\" in which he relates the life of the great Tacaño, or\r\ncaptain of thieves, the type of a Spanish rogue. This tale, by its\r\nfamiliarity with vice, squalid penury, and vulgar roguery, becomes\r\ntiresome; nor is it to be compared in richness of humour to Mendoza's\r\nhistory of Lazarillo de los Tormes. The letters of the \"Cavallero de\r\nTenaza,\" or knight of the pincer, are very whimsical. They are in\r\nridicule of avarice, a sin, which Quevedo declares in another work to be\r\nthe most unnatural of all. They are addressed to a lady; and are lessons\r\nto teach how little can be given, and how much preserved, by a man on\r\nall occasions. This sort of dry humour turning on one idea amuses at\r\nfirst, but at last becomes wearisome.\r\n\r\nIt is on his Visions however, his most original work, that his European\r\nreputation rests. Nothing can be more novel, singular and striking. They\r\nconsist of various visions of the other world; where he sees the end of\r\nearthly vanities and the punishments that await crime. They are full of\r\nknowledge of human nature, vivacity, wit and daring imagination; they\r\nremind the reader of Lucian; and if they are less airy and fanciful,\r\nthey are bolder and more sarcastic. They have the fault, it is true, of\r\ndwelling too exclusively on subjects of mean and vulgar\r\ninterest--alguazils, attornies, ruffians, and all sorts of rogues of\r\nboth sexes; among which, tailors figure preeminently. Now that tailors\r\nprovide their own cloth, we have lost that intense notion of\r\n\"cabbaging,\" which was so deeply impressed on the minds of our\r\nancestors, when they only fashioned cloth sent to them. Tailors are with\r\nQuevedo the very _ne plus ultra_ of a thief. As lord Byron styles a\r\npirate \"a sea-solicitor,\" so Quevedo calls a robber \"a tailor of the\r\nhighways.\" Several of these visions were written while their author was\r\ncomparatively young: (one, dedicated to the duke of Osuna, is dated\r\n1610, when he was thirty years of age), and possess the glow and spirit\r\nof early life. Nothing can be more startling and vivid than the\r\ncommencement of the \"Vision of Calvary.\" The blast of the last trump is\r\ndescribed, and then he goes on to say: \"The sound enforced obedience\r\nfrom marble, and hearing from the dead. All the earth began to move,\r\ngiving permission to the bones to seek one another. After a short\r\ninterval, I beheld those who had been soldiers arise in wrath from their\r\ngraves, believing themselves summoned to battle: the avaricious looked\r\nup with anxiety and alarm fearing an attack, while men of pleasure\r\nfancied that the horns sounded to invite them to the chase. Then I saw\r\nhow many fled with disgust or terror from their old bodies, of which\r\nsome wanted an arm, some an eye; and I laughed at the odd figures they\r\ncut, while I admired the contrivance of Providence, that all being\r\nconfounded together, no mistake was made. In one churchyard only, there\r\nwas some confusion and exchanging in the appropriation of heads; and I\r\nsaw an attorney who denied that his own soul belonged to him. But I was\r\nmost frightened at seeing two or three merchants who put on their souls\r\nso awry, that all their five senses got into their fingers.\"\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the \"Alguazil possessed\" is equally spirited. A\r\nspectator calling him a man bedevilled, the bad spirit, within, cries\r\nout that \"He is not a man but an alguazil; and you must know that it is\r\nagainst their will that devils possess alguazils; so that you ought\r\nrather to call me a devil be-alguazilled than an alguazil bedevilled.\"\r\nHe is almost as inveterate against duennas, a race of people peculiar to\r\nSpain, and he disposes of them ludicrously enough in the infernal\r\nregons. \"I went a little further,\" he says, \"and came to an immense and\r\ntroubled swamp, where there was so much noise that my head was\r\nbewildered: I asked what it was, and was told that it proceeded from\r\nwomen who had turned duennas on earth. And thus I discovered that those\r\nwho are duennas in this life, are frogs in the next, and like frogs, are\r\nfor ever croaking amidst the wet and mud; and very properly do they act\r\nthe parts of infernal frogs, since duennas are neither fish nor flesh.\r\nI laughed to see them turned into such ugly things, with faces as\r\ncare-worn and wrinkled as those of duennas here on earth.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the sort of wit that Quevedo indulges in; terse, pointed,\r\nbitter, and driven home with an unsparing hand. Extravagant in its\r\nimaginations, yet so proportioned to the truth of nature as to excite\r\nadmiration as well as surprise, and to be the model of a variety of\r\nimitations, none of which come up to him in penetration, vivacity and\r\nsubtle felicity of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: \"Murieron luego mis padres,\r\nDios en el cielo los tenga,\r\nporque no vuelvan acà,\r\ny a engendrar mas hijos vuelvan.\"\r\n\r\n_Musa_, VI.--_Romance_, XVI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Cespedes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: \"Memoria immortal de D.

The whole, from which the\r\nabove is an extract, runs thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Retirado en la paz de estos desiertos,\r\nCon pocos, pero doctos libros juntos,\r\nVivo en conversacion con los difuntos,\r\nY escuchocon mis ojos à los muertos.\r\nSino siempre entendidos, siempre abiertos,\r\nO enmiendan, o fecundan mis assuntos,\r\nY en musicos callados contrapuntos\r\nAl sueño de la vida hablan despiertos.\r\nLas grandes almas, que la Muerte ausenta\r\nDe injurias, de los años vengadora,\r\nLibra, o gran Don Joseph, docta la emprenta.\r\nEn fuga irrevocable huye la hora;\r\nPero aquella el mejor calculo cuenta\r\nQue en la lección y estudios nos mejora.\"\r\n\r\n_Musa_ II. _Soneta_ 90.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Musa VI., romance XVI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Vida de Quevedo por Tarsia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: As a specimen of Quevedo's poetry, Quintana quotes a\r\nsonnet, which Wiffen has translated, and which has the merit of force\r\nand truth.\r\n\r\n\"THE RUINS OF ROME.\r\n\r\n\"Pilgrim, thou look'st in Rome for Rome divine,\r\nAnd ev'n in Rome no Rome can find! her crowd\r\nOf mural wonders is a corse, whose shroud\r\nAnd fitting tomb is the lone Aventine.\r\nShe lies where reigned the kingly Palatine,\r\nAnd Time's worn medals more of ruin show\r\nFrom her ten thousand fights than even the blow\r\nStruck at the crown of her imperial line,\r\nTiber alone remains, whose rushing tide\r\nWaters the town, now sepulchred in stone,\r\nAnd weeps its funeral with fraternal tears:\r\nO Rome! in thy wild beauty, power, and pride,\r\nThe durable is fled; and what alone\r\nIs fugitive, abides the ravening years!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALDERON\r\n\r\n1601-1687.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe draw to a close. Misrule and oppression had their inevitable results,\r\ncrushing and destroying the spirit and intellect of Spain; and after, by\r\nan extraordinary harvest of writers, the soil had shown what it could\r\ndo, it became waste and barren. For a long time, the purists, the\r\nGongorists, the partisans of a glittering and false style, exerted their\r\ninfluence. A critic and poet of eminence, Luzan, exerted himself to\r\nrestore Spanish poetry. He succeeded in exploding the false taste; and\r\nMoratin, the author of some excellent dramas, followed in his steps:\r\nbut, latterly, the state of the country has been too distracted for\r\nliterature to gain any attention.\r\n\r\nBefore we close the series of Spanish Lives, however, one more is to be\r\nadded, and it is that of the greatest poet of Spain. Little, very\r\nlittle, however, is known of him. We regret that we have not fuller\r\naccounts of Cervantes. We search the voluminous works of Lope de Vega to\r\nacquire knowledge of his character and of the events of his life; while\r\nthe career of one far greater than he, and, as a poet, infinitely\r\nsuperior to Cervantes himself, is wrapped in such obscurity that we can\r\ndiscern only its bare outline, and no one has endeavoured to fill up the\r\nsketch, nor by seeking for letters and other documents, to give us a\r\nfuller, and as it were coloured picture, of what Calderon was. This\r\npartly arises from the prosperity of his life: adversity presents\r\nobjects that catch the attention and demand research: an even course of\r\nhappiness, like a campaign country, eludes description. The only\r\naccount we have of him proceeds from a friend[122], who commences with\r\nblowing a trumpet, as if he were going to tell us much. \"How can his\r\nlimited powers,\" he says, \"describe him who occupies all the tongues of\r\nfame? and ill will a short epilogue befit the man whose merits endless\r\nages cannot limit.\" And then he goes on to tell us that \"his swift pen\r\nshall comprise a brief sigh in a long regret, and raise an honourable\r\ntomb to his sacred ashes; adopting for the purpose one of the many pens\r\nwhich his fame furnishes, until others better cut than his shall publish\r\neulogies worthy of his name.\"\r\n\r\nDon Pedro Calderon de la Barca was born in 1601[123]; thus coming into\r\nthe world of poetry at the moment when the plays of Lope de Vega were in\r\nvogue, and when Cervantes was calling the attention of mankind to his\r\nimmortal work. His biographer takes the pains to preserve the\r\nintelligence that he wept before he was born; \"thus to enter the world\r\nenshadowed by gloom, which he, like a new sun, was to fill with joy.\"\r\nAnd he tells us that he collected \"this important information from Donna\r\nDorotea Calderon de la Barca, his sister, a nun in the royal convent of\r\nSt. Clara at Toledo.\" The family of Calderon was illustrious, and\r\nenjoyed an ancient hidalgoship (or _solar_) in the valley of Carriedo\r\namong the mountains of Burgos; the very place, we may observe, where\r\nLope de Vega's ancestors resided, and whence his father emigrated, when,\r\ndriven by straitened means, he removed to Madrid. The family of Calderon\r\nhad migrated many years before, and were settled at Toledo. His mother's\r\nname was Donna Ana Maria de Henao y Riaña, and her origin was derived\r\nfrom an ancient family in the Low Countries, descended from the Seigneur\r\nde Mons, and which had been settled in Spain for many years.\r\n\r\nHis childhood was spent under the paternal roof, and even as a hoy he\r\nwas conspicuous for his intelligence and acquirements. At the age of\r\nfourteen he entered the university of Salamanca. He remained there for\r\nfive years, and rendered himself conspicuous by his ardour for study,\r\nand by the progress he made in the most abstruse and difficult sciences.\r\nAlready also had he begun to write plays, which were acted with applause\r\nin several Spanish theatres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1620.\r\nÆtat.\r\n19.]\r\n\r\nAt the age of nineteen he left Salamanca. These dates are given us, but\r\nthe intermediate spaces are unfilled up. We are not told whether he\r\nresided at Madrid or with his family at Toledo. His fame became\r\nestablished as a poet, and began to rival that of Lope, whom indeed he\r\nfar transcended in the higher gifts of poetry, creative imagination,\r\nsublimity, and force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1626.\r\nÆtat.\r\n25.]\r\n\r\nAt the age of five and twenty he entered the military service, and\r\nserved his king first in the Milanese and afterwards in Flanders, the\r\nold fields of war for Spain, whereon had fought and fallen so many\r\nheroes of both countries, and so many human beings had fallen victims to\r\nreligious and political persecution. He spent ten years in this manner.\r\nSismondi says, that his life is sprinkled with few events. How do we\r\nknow this? Throughout these campaigns, during these years of youthful\r\nardour and enterprise, how much may have occurred, what dangers he may\r\nhave run--what generosity, what valour he may have displayed--how warmly\r\nhe may have loved, how deeply have suffered! As a poet and a master of\r\nthe passions he must have felt them all. But a blank meets us when we\r\nseek to know more of these things. A poet's life is ever a romance. That\r\nCalderon's was such we cannot doubt; but we must find its traces in the\r\nloves, the woes, the courage, and the joys of his dramatic personages:\r\nhe infused his soul into these; what the events might be that called\r\nforth his own personal interest and sympathy we are totally ignorant.\r\n[Sidenote: 1637.\r\nÆtat.\r\n36.]\r\nAn order from his sovereign recalled him to court. Philip IV. was\r\npassionately fond of the theatre, and himself wrote plays. Innumerable\r\ndramas appeared under his patronage, the names of the authors being\r\nutterly unknown; and even of those of acknowledged writers few have been\r\ncollected and published under the name of their author. Single plays, in\r\npamphlets, we find in plenty, all very similar the one to the other; a\r\nbetter arrangement in the plot, more or less poetry or spirit in the\r\ndialogue, being almost all the difference we find among them. Several of\r\nthe most entertaining are given forth as by a Wit of the Court (_un\r\nIngenio de esta Corte_), and attributed to Philip IV. himself; though\r\nthis honour has been disputed him. Moreto also, the gayest and most\r\ncomic of the Spanish dramatists, flourished at this time. Lope was dead;\r\nbut his place was filled up, not by one, but by many, who, under royal\r\npatronage, were eager to pay the tribute of a play to the theatre of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nPhilip IV. saw Calderon's dramas represented. He perceived their merit,\r\nand thought he might serve his king much better by residing in Spain and\r\nwriting for the theatre, than by bearing arms in Flanders, where there\r\nwere so many men who could not write plays, much more fit to be knocked\r\non the head. He summoned Calderon to court, by a royal order, for the\r\nsake of writing a drama for a palace festival; bestowed on him also the\r\nhabit of Santiago, and excusing him his military duties commanded him,\r\ninstead, to furnish a play. Calderon wrote the \"Certamen de Amor\" (the\r\nCombat of Love), and \"Zelos\" (Jealousy), which were acted at the palace\r\nof Buen-Retiro. Calderon wrote as he was commanded; but, unwilling to\r\nleave the army, he obtained a commission in the company of the\r\ncount-duke of Olivarez, which he followed to Catalonia, and remained\r\ntill the peace, when he returned to court; when the king conferred on\r\nhim the pay of thirty crowns a month in the artillery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1650.\r\nÆtat.\r\n49.]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, while staying in the country with the duke of Alva,\r\nthe king sent for him to celebrate the festivals that occurred on his\r\nmarriage with Maria Ana of Austria.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifty-one he quitted the military career, to which for\r\nmany years he had been passionately attached, and, being ordained, he\r\nbecame a priest. The king, who always favoured him, made him chaplain of\r\na royal chapel at Toledo, of which he took possession on the 19th of\r\nJune of the same year.\r\n[Sidenote: 1654.\r\nÆtat.\r\n53.]\r\nBut the king, dissatisfied with his distance from court, and his\r\nconsequent inability to assist properly at the royal feasts, gave him a\r\nroyal chaplaincy, and recalled him to Madrid; bestowing on him besides a\r\npension, derived from the revenues of Sicily, besides other presents and\r\nrewards, the ever-renewing recompence of his labours. Calderon now wrote\r\na play at each celebration of the king's birth-day, not only for Madrid,\r\nbut for Toledo, Seville, and Granada. As he advanced in age, he obtained\r\nother church preferments.\r\n[Sidenote: 1687.\r\nÆtat.\r\n86.]\r\nHe died on the 29th of May, 1687, at the age of eighty-six. He left the\r\ncongregation of St. Peter heir to all he possessed.\r\n\r\nIn describing his character, his biographer indulges in Spanish\r\nhyperbole instead of original traits. He calls him the oracle of the\r\ncourt, the envy of strangers, the father of the Muses, the lynx of\r\nlearning, the light of the drama. He adds, that his house was ever the\r\nshelter of the needy; that his modesty and humility were excessive;\r\nattentive in his courtesy; a sure friend, and a good man.\r\n\r\nCalderon never collected nor published his plays. The duke of Veragua at\r\none time addressed him a flattering letter, requesting to be furnished\r\nwith a complete list of his dramas, as the booksellers were in the habit\r\nof selling the works of other writers under his name. Calderon, who was\r\nthen in his eightieth year, supplied the duke with a list only of \"Autos\r\nSacramentales.\" He added, in a letter, that with regard to his temporal\r\ndramas, of which he had written an hundred and eleven, he felt offended,\r\nthat in addition to his own faulty works, those of other authors should\r\nbe ascribed to him; and besides that his writings were so altered, that\r\nhe himself could not recognise even their titles. He also expressed his\r\ndetermination of following the example of the booksellers, and to pay as\r\nlittle regard to his plays as they did. He observed, that on religious\r\ngrounds, he attached more importance to his \"Autos.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral collections of Calderon's plays appeared during his life; one of\r\nthem being edited by his brother, and another by his friend and\r\nbiographer, Don Juan de Vera Tassis y Villarroel, who published a hundred\r\nand twenty-seven plays, and ninety-five autos; but it is doubted whether\r\nall these are really his. This doubt, of course, appertains to the more\r\nmediocre ones. In the best, the stamp of Calderon's original genius\r\ncannot be doubted.\r\n\r\nBouterwek and Sismondi have both entered into considerable detail with\r\nregard to Calderon's plays, but we have no space to indulge in a similar\r\nanalysis, although, with our admiration for this great poet, we should\r\nbe glad to enter with minute detail on his merits; but we must confine\r\nourselves to some description of his characteristics.\r\n\r\nSchlegel is an enthusiastic admirer of Calderon; and his observations on\r\nhis works are replete with truth. Other writers--among them the author\r\nof an article on the Spanish theatre, in the twenty-fifth volume of the\r\n\"Quarterly Review\"--are less willing to attribute high merit to him. We\r\nconfess that our opinion more nearly coincides with Schlegel. He carries\r\ntoo far, we allow, his theory of the ideal of Calderon's morality,\r\npiety, and honour. It is true, that these are too deeply founded on the\r\nbigotry and falsehood of inquisitorial faith, and a false point of\r\nhonour; but with all this, within the circle which his sentiments and\r\nbelief prescribe, he is a master of the passions and the imagination.\r\nThere is a wild and lofty aim in all his more romantic plays, which put\r\nbarely down, despoiled of the working of the passions and the magic of\r\npoetry, seems monstrous, but which, however different from our notions\r\nof the present day, strike a chord that vibrates to the depth of the\r\nheart. We may give as an instance, that supernatural machinery is\r\nintroduced into very many of Calderon's plays; and Shakespear himself\r\ncannot manage the agency of the spiritual world as Calderon has done. He\r\nenlists a sort of belief on his side, which it is difficult to describe,\r\nbut impossible to withstand. It is not a mere ghost that walks the\r\nearth, but an embodying, at the same time, of the conscience and fears\r\nof the person thus visited. Thus in the \"Purgatory of St. Patrick:\"\r\nLudovico Ennio, the villain of the piece, has for many years resolved to\r\nassassinate an enemy. He has travelled through many countries,\r\nnourishing the idea of vengeance, and returns to Ireland resolved to\r\naccomplish it. He wraps himself in his mantle, and thus disguised, he\r\ngoes for three successive nights to the street where his enemy lives,\r\nresolved to stab him: but, at the moment that he fancies that he shall\r\nattain his aim, he is met by a man similarly disguised\r\n(_embozado_--muffled up in a cloak) who calls to him; but when he\r\nfollows, the _embozado_ disappears so quickly, it seems as if the wind\r\nwere in his feet. Ludovico enraged, on the fourth night lays in wait\r\nagain, and takes his servant with him, that the disguised intruder may\r\nnot escape. He arrives again at the street, resolved on the death of his\r\nenemy. At this moment the cloak-wrapped figure appears before him.\r\nExasperated by his appearance, he declares that he will take two\r\nvengeances; one on his ancient enemy, the other on the intruder: the\r\nfigure calls him by his name, and bids him follow. Ludovico draws on\r\nhim, but pierces only the empty air; at once astonished and indignant,\r\nhe still pursues till they come to a desert place, when Ludovico\r\nexclaims, \"Here we are, body to body, alone, but my sword cannot injure\r\nthee: tell me, then, who thou art; art thou a man, a vision, or a\r\ndæmon! You answer not--then thus I dare throw off your mantle!\" But,\r\nhidden by the cloak is a skeleton only; and aghast with terror, he\r\nexclaims, \"Great God! what dreadful spectacle is this! Horrible\r\nvision!--Mortal terror! what art thou--stark corse--that crumbled into\r\nearth and dust, yet live? The figure replies, \"Knowrest thou not\r\nthyself?--I am thy portraiture--I am Ludovico Ennio!\" These words, this\r\nfearful sight, awaken horror and remorse in the criminal's mind; his\r\nheart perceives the truths and how his crimes, indeed, had made him but\r\nan image of death itself. He is thus prepared for the purgatory where\r\nhis sins are to be expiated. Many of the plays thus turn upon visions,\r\nportions of the mind itself personified; while, at the same time, the\r\naffections and the passions find a voice all truth and poetry, that\r\ncharms, agitates, and interests.\r\n\r\nHis autos are conceived in the same spirit. It is true, there is too\r\nmuch theological disquisition and doctrine in them, and that \"God the\r\nFather plays the school-divine;\" but, on the other hand, the poet often\r\nappears to open a new world before us, which we view tremblingly at\r\nfirst, till he leads us on by that mastery of the human imagination\r\nwhich he possesses--knowing so well what it can believe, and what it\r\ncannot disbelieve--and thus bringing heaven and hell palpably and\r\nfeelingly before us. The auto of \"Life is a dream.\" (_La Vida es\r\nSueño_) more than any other, is an instance of that peculiarity, which\r\nwe imperfectly endeavour to describe, of clothing in sensible and potent\r\nimagery, the thoughts of the brain, the feelings of the heart. Yet this\r\nis not done in the German style. The Germans subtilise, mystify, and\r\ncloud the real and distinct: they dissolve flesh and blood into a dream.\r\nCalderon, on the contrary, turns a dream into flesh and blood: he gives\r\na pulse to a skeleton; he breathes passion from the lips of ghosts and\r\nspectres. Which is the greater power, others must decide. The influence\r\nof Calderon is greatest to us; he is master of a spell to which our\r\nsouls own obedience.\r\n\r\nCalderon, as a poet, is diffuse and exaggerated at times, but he is\r\nhighly imaginative; and as he gives human sympathies to the impalpable\r\nand visionary, so does he inform the visible universe with a soul of\r\nbeauty and feeling. A poet alone could translate Calderon. The only\r\ntranslation we have, is a few scenes from the \"Magico Prodigioso\" by\r\nShelley. These breathe at once the Spaniard's peculiarities--his\r\nfantastic machinery--his incomparable sweetness. Justina is one of the\r\nmost beautiful of his creations; a maiden, vowed to chastity, who being\r\nin vain tempted by the love of many admirers, is assailed by the\r\nseductions of hell itself. Nature--the birds, the leaves, and wandering\r\nclouds, breathe of love, and endeavour to soften and corrupt her\r\nheart.[124] The \"Principe Costante\" (the Constant Prince) seems to be\r\nthe most popular of Calderon's plays with his critics. \"La Vida es\r\nSueño\" (Life is a Dream)--not the auto, but the play--is another, full\r\nof wild strange interest, original and sublime. \"The Schism of England\"\r\nis among the most striking of his plays. One passage, where a cavalier\r\ndescribes how he fell in love with Anna Bullen, is fraught with touching\r\nsweetness and tender deep-felt passion.\r\n\r\nCalderon is, besides, a great master of comedy. His \"Gracioso\" (or\r\nClown), is different from Lope's--more poetic and fanciful, more\r\nvivacious and humorous. In the \"Señora y la Criada\" (the Lady and her\r\nMaid), where a country girl is carried off in mistake for her mistress,\r\nthere is a comic mistake, most amusingly wrought.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that we consider that, while Schlegel refines too much\r\nupon the perfection of the art and the sublimity of the moral of the\r\npoet, we think that the critic of the Quarterly Review rates his merits\r\nat too low a standard. We do not agree that he \"cannot admit us within\r\nthe gates of horror and thrilling fear.\" On the contrary, we think that\r\nmuch of his power results from his mastery over these emotions. We can\r\nscarcely allow that \"the sacred source of sympathetic flows not at his\r\ncommand.\" The simply pathetic is certainly not his characteristic; but\r\nthe tears may start forth in sympathy for the grandeur of soul exhibited\r\nby the Constant Prince; the heart be charmed and interested by the\r\nsweetness of Justina, and he touched by the fatherly sorrows of David,\r\nin \"Los Cabellos de Absolom.\"\r\n\r\nCalderon is much more readable, much more interesting than Lope. He\r\nrises higher. It is not only complexity of plot, endless variety of\r\nsituations, and well sustained dialogue, there is interest of a higher\r\nkind; and, though it is true that perfect harmony is wanting in his\r\ncompositions, and that he riots too much \"without constraint or\r\ncontrol,\" yet the colours of his poetry are so bright, and the music of\r\nhis verse so grand and enthralling, that we feel as we read that he is\r\none of the master geniuses of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Fama Vida y Escritos de Don Pedro Calderon de la Barca\r\npor Don Juan de Vera Tassis y Villarroel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: Bouterwek and Sismondi give 1600 as the date of\r\nCalderon's birth.--His Spanish biographer mentions 1601.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Shelley's Posthumous Poems.--Translations. There is a\r\nbeautiful passage, drawn from the \"Purgatorio de San Patricio,\"\r\nintroduced into this author's tragedy of the Cenci.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY POETS OF PORTUGAL\r\n\r\nRIBEYRA, GIL VICENTE, SAA DE MIRANDA, FERREIRA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same spirit that inspired the Spanish Cancionero, and animated the\r\npeople of Castile with the love of song, spread itself to the western\r\nportion of the peninsula; and; from the earliest times, Portuguese poets\r\ncomposed, and the population of Portugal sang, in their native dialect:\r\nand thus using it as the medium for conveying their dearest feelings,\r\ncaused it to be perpetuated as a national language. Originally the\r\nPortuguese tongue was the same as the Gallician; and, had Portugal\r\nremained a province of Spain, its peculiar dialect had, like that of\r\nArragon and of Gallicia, been driven from the fields of literature by\r\nthe Castilian, and while (to use an appropriate metaphor) it might creep\r\nin tiny rivulets here and there over the country, the Castilian had\r\nflowed a mighty river, receiving all minor streams as tributaries. But\r\nat quite the close of the eleventh century Alphonso VI., a Spanish\r\nsovereign, celebrated for his victories over the Moors, gave the county\r\nof Portugal as a dowry to his daughter on her marriage with Henry of\r\nBurgundy, a prince of the royal family of France. The son of this\r\nprince, Alphonso Henriquez, was the founder of the Portuguese monarchy.\r\nHe conquered all that portion of the peninsula that forms Portugal, with\r\nthe exception of the Algarve. He took Lisbon, and thus became possessed\r\nof a powerful and rich capital, and he signalised his successes, by\r\nchanging the appellation of what had hitherto been a province, and by\r\nnaming his dominions a kingdom. From this time the Portuguese became a\r\nseparate nation from the Castilian; their institutions became national,\r\nand their language asserted for itself a distinct existence.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese were a poetic people, and the Portuguese language adapted\r\nto poetry. It is softer than the Castilian, it discards more entirely\r\nLatin consonants; but with all, there is something truncated and\r\nincomplete in its sounds, very different from the sonorous beauty of the\r\nSpanish. It did not adopt the Arabic guttural, but it acquired, no one\r\nknows whence, a nasal twang, more decided and obtrusive even than that\r\nof the French, which considerably mars its melody. Still it is\r\nexpressive, it is soft, and it is harmonious; and these qualities\r\nrendered it applicable to verse: so that a poet found no difficulty in\r\nclothing his ideas and emotions in the language of his native country.\r\nMany poets flourished therefore at an early age, though we know little\r\nof their productions. Endeavours have been made to find their ancient\r\n_cancioneiro geral_[125], but they were unsuccessful, and a guess only\r\ncan be made as to the nature of their contents.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese nation was as peculiar in its pursuits and character as\r\nin its language. They were not an agricultural but a pastoral people;\r\nand at the same time, their long extent of sea shore led them to the\r\npursuits of commerce and navigation. While the Italian republics were\r\nenriching themselves by the trade of the Mediterranean, and while Spain,\r\nunder Ferdinand and Isabella was, by conquering the whole of its\r\nterritory from the Moors, laying the foundation of the brief grandeur of\r\nCharles V., and the despotism and national degradation that followed,\r\nthe sovereigns of Portugal were encouraging their subjects in the\r\nmaritime discoveries, which in a short time changed the aspect of the\r\ncivilised globe: for the very expedition of Columbus was the offspring\r\nof the Portuguese voyages. It was for the sake of discovering _another_\r\nroute to India, than the hitherto unsuccessful one along the coast of\r\nAfrica, that he sailed over the illimitable Western Sea. In 1487,\r\nBartolomeo Diaz doubled the Cape of Good Hope: many years had been\r\npreviously occupied in creeping along the shores of Africa; but the\r\nmoment this Cape was doubled, the navigators made a spring, and the\r\ncelebrated Vasco de Gama reached the renowned and unvisited shores of\r\nIndia. In less than fifteen years from this time, Francisco de Almeida,\r\nand Alfonso de Albuquerque founded a Portuguese kingdom in Hindostan, of\r\nwhich Goa was the capital. We may imagine the spirit and enthusiasm that\r\nanimated this people; they found a new world overflowing with all the\r\nprecious treasures most valued in Europe; they did not content\r\nthemselves with trading with the people, a people highly civilised,\r\npossessed of literature and all the appendages of an advanced state of\r\nhuman political association; but by their valour they conquered them and\r\nmade a portion of the country their own. High notions of national\r\nimportance and future national glory filled their souls; it was a period\r\nwhen each man could regard his native country with pride, and such a\r\ntime is peculiarly favourable to the birth of genius, and, above all, to\r\nthe developement of the spirit of poetry.\r\n\r\nBernardim Ribeyro is named the Ennius of Portugal. He was a man of an\r\nenthusiastic and tender disposition; his poems, full of passion and\r\ndespair, emanated from an attachment to some unknown lady; some say the\r\ninfanta Donna Beatrice, the king's daughter. His eclogues are more known\r\nthan the rest of his works, and are considered the most excellent[126];\r\nyet, though they are feeling, there is a poverty of ideas, and a want of\r\nclassical correctness and compression, that speaks of the infancy of\r\ncomposition. But his most celebrated work is an unfinished prose\r\nromance, in which, under feigned names and obscure allusions, he\r\nnarrates his own history and loves. We have not seen this work, and\r\nborrow the account of it from Bouterwek, who observes, that \"such is the\r\nobscurity of the whole, that nothing can be comprehended of the\r\ncircumstances without the utmost effort of attention. The monotony of\r\nincessant love complaints, renders the prolixity of the narrative still\r\nmore tedious; but even amidst that monotony and prolixity, it is easy to\r\nrecognise a spirit truly poetic, more remarkable however for\r\nsusceptibility than energy.\"\r\n\r\nOther poets succeeded to Ribeyro, who also sang of love and pastoral\r\nthemes, and the poetry of Portugal as well as that of Spain, confined\r\nitself to the language of sentiment and description--instead of assuming\r\nan heroic and epic measure.\r\n\r\nThe reformation of Castilian poetry introduced into Spain by Boscan and\r\nGarcilaso, penetrated into Portugal; and, singularly enough, the poets\r\nwho followed, quitted their native idiom to adopt that of the rival\r\ncountry. The cause of so unpatriotic an adoption can only be guessed at.\r\nBouterwek attributes it to the more sonorous and complete sound of the\r\nCastilian. Spain, it may be observed, was the larger country and in more\r\nimmediate connection with Italy; when, therefore, Italian forms of\r\npoetic composition were introduced into the peninsula, they flowed, as\r\nit were, through Spain, and arrived at the West clothed in a Spanish\r\ngarb. Perceiving the superior power and charm of the Petrarchist\r\ncompositions, their imitators at once adopted the very language in which\r\nthey were clothed. Saa de Miranda wrote his best works, his eclogues, in\r\nSpanish, though the same spirit that led him to desert Latin, so long\r\nthe favourite of educated men, also induced him to write in his native\r\nlanguage, and Francisco Diaz names him the real founder of Portuguese\r\npoetry. Saa de Miranda was a man of strong feelings, with something too\r\nof an eccentric turn of mind. He insisted on marrying a lady neither\r\nyoung nor handsome, whom he had never seen; but whose reputation for\r\ndiscretion and goodness charmed him. He became so attached to her, that\r\nwhen she died some years after, he remained that most rare of all men,\r\nan inconsolable widower; giving up all the pursuits and purposes of\r\nlife--neither shaving his beard nor paring his nails--and three years\r\nafter following her to the grave. And Jorge de Montemayor altogether\r\ncast aside his native language, and enriched the Castilian by a new form\r\nof composition, the pastoral romance, which became a general favourite\r\nthroughout Spain, imitated by every writer, but not excelled by any.\r\n\r\nIn this brief summary of the predecessors of Camoens, introduced chiefly\r\nto shew the state of national poetry when he appeared, we are unable to\r\ndo full justice to any of these writers, and are obliged to omit the\r\nnames of many. But we must not pass over Gil Vicente, who is styled the\r\nPortuguese Plautus. Very little is known of him--the very period of his\r\nbirth only guessed at; it is supposed that he was born at the close of\r\nthe fifteenth century. He was an indefatigable writer, and furnished the\r\nroyal family and public with dramatic entertainments suited to the taste\r\nof the age. He wrote entirely in the old national manner. He appears to\r\nhave been the inventor of _Autos_, or spiritual dramas, which raised\r\ninto a regular and poetic style of play the monkish or buffoonish\r\nfestive representations.\r\n\r\nDoctor Bowring has introduced translations of several of this poet's\r\nsongs; these were written in Spanish, they are characterised by a\r\ncharming simplicity, and are peculiarly short; one chord of a lyre\r\nstruck, as it were, one emotion of the heart breathed forth in words;\r\nwithout elaborate display or any attempt at imagery or metaphor beyond\r\nthe one single feeling that dictates the poem.\r\n\r\nAntonio Ferreira must be mentioned as a classic poet of Portugal. He is\r\nstyled the Portuguese Horace. He was of noble family, and destined by\r\nhis parents to fill some high public office in the state. He took the\r\ndegree of doctor in the university of Coimbra, where he studied civil\r\nlaw. He was an enthusiastic lover of his native language, and resolved\r\nnever to write in any other, at the same time that he founded his taste\r\nand style on the study of Horace. He admired also the excellencies of\r\nItalian poetry, and introduced the measure and structure of its verse\r\ninto the Portuguese. It was the object of his ambition at once to be\r\nhimself a classic poet; and to give to his native Portugal a classic\r\nstyle of poetry. Ferreira was nine and twenty when he published the\r\nfirst collection of his poetic works. He had friends who admired his\r\ngenius and joined him in his pursuits. He quitted the university for the\r\ncourt, and filled a high place as judge, and was also appointed\r\ngentleman of the royal household; he became an oracle of criticism, and\r\nlooked forward to brilliant prospects through life, when he died of the\r\nplague which raged in Lisbon in 1569, at the age of forty-one.\r\n\r\nFerreira, without possessing the originality of Gil Vicente, his\r\nsweetness or his genius, was eminently useful to the art of poetry in\r\nPortugal. He taught the writers of that country to aim at correctness,\r\nand to enrich their compositions by the knowledge acquired from the\r\nwritings of other countries; but not, for that purpose, to adopt a\r\nforeign tongue, but to raise the Portuguese to the level of other\r\nlanguages, and gift it with the purest and noblest poetic measures. He\r\nis, himself, novel, however, rather in his style than in his ideas. His\r\nepistles are his best work; the sentiments he expresses are elevated,\r\nand his fancy and poetic verve graced them with a diction and imagery\r\nwhich raises them in the class of such compositions. The distinctive\r\nfeeling however to be found in Ferreira, animating all he wrote, was\r\npatriotism. The glory, the advancement and the civilisation of Portugal,\r\nwere the themes of his praise, and the objects which he furthered with\r\nhis utmost endeavours. He exhorts his friends not to permit the Muses in\r\nPortugal to speak any thing but Portuguese. Of himself, he says, in\r\nvery beautiful verses, that \"he shall be content with the glory of\r\nloving his native land, and his countrymen.\" It was this enthusiasm that\r\nelevated Ferreira into a great man. He is a little misplaced here, as he\r\nwas a few years younger than Camoens; but it shows the spirit that was\r\nabroad in Camoens' time--a patriotic spirit that loved to express its\r\ngenuine sentiments in language warm from the heart and familiar to the\r\ntongue. In this Camoens and Ferreira were alike; they loved their native\r\ncountry, and were eager to adorn its literature with native flowers. In\r\nother respects they were different. Ferreira's classic pages bear no\r\nresemblance to the fire, passion, and rich fancy of Camoens, to whom we\r\nnow turn as to one of the favourites of fame, though he was the\r\nneglected child of his country, and the victim of an adverse fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: In Castilian _cancioneros general_ or general song books.\r\n_Vide_ Bouterwek; Sismondi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: Bouterwek.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMOENS\r\n\r\n1524-1579.\r\n\r\n\r\nCamoens and Cervantes encountered, in several respects, a similar\r\ndestiny. They were both men of genius, both men of military valour; both\r\nwere disregarded by their contemporaries, and suffered extreme\r\nmisfortune. Camoens, indeed, has in this a sad advantage over Cervantes.\r\nThe latter lived in poverty, but the former died in want. Posterity\r\nendeavoured to repair the injuries inflicted by ungrateful\r\ncontemporaries. The circumstances of the life of Camoens were carefully\r\ncollected. Several able native commentators wrote elaborate notes on the\r\n\"Lusiad,\" and lastly a magnificent edition of that poem was published in\r\n1817. Nor have the English been unmindful of the great Portuguese poet.\r\nSir Richard Fanshaw translated the \"Lusiad\" as far back as Cromwell's\r\ntime; but the present popular translation is by Mickle. He bestowed\r\ngreat pains on the work, and accompanied it by various essays relative\r\nto its subject, and a life of Camoens. His version has great merit, as\r\nwill be hereafter mentioned, notwithstanding its want of fidelity and\r\nthe signal defect of being written in heroic couplets, instead of\r\neight-line stanzas, like the original. Lord Strangford appended a sketch\r\nof Camoens' life to his translation of a portion of his \"Rimas;\" and,\r\nlastly, Mr. Adamson has presented the English reader with an elaborate\r\nbiography, attended by all sorts of valuable collateral information and\r\nembellishments.\r\n\r\nThe family of Camoens was originally of Gallicia, and possessed\r\nextensive demesnes in that province. The old Spanish name of the family\r\nwas Caamaños--the etymology of which has occupied the commentators. We\r\nare told, among others, that it was derived from Cadmus. There is\r\nnothing extraordinary in this. All readers conversant with old national\r\nannals, are aware that they usually derive their immediate origin either\r\nfrom a son of Noah, or some well known Grecian hero: Ulysses, it was\r\nsaid, founded Lisbon. It was probably adopted from the castle of Cadmon,\r\nwhere they resided. The poet himself, however, refers it to a more\r\nimaginative source. In ancient times, in Gallicia, there existed a bird\r\nnamed the Camaõ, which never survived the infidelity of the wife of its\r\nlord. The moment the lady went astray, the bird sought its master, and\r\nexpired at his feet. A matron of the house of Cadmon was unjustly\r\naccused of ill faith--she entrusted her defence to the cadmaõ, and the\r\nsuccess of her appeal caused her husband, grateful for this restoration\r\nto honour and domestic felicity, to adopt the name of the saviour bird.\r\nThis is a tale of romance and barbarism, of the days of ordeal and\r\ndegrading suspicion; but Camoens himself alludes to it, and it derives\r\ninterest from his mention.[127]\r\n\r\nThe family of Caamaños possessed a _solar_ or ancestral inheritance in\r\nGallicia, and reigned over seventeen villages near the promontory of\r\nFinisterre. One of the lords of this family having killed a cavalier de\r\nCastros, they were obliged to migrate, and settled at a fortress called\r\nRubianes; where Faria y Sousa tells us the family still remain, great in\r\nbirth, but of diminished means.[128]\r\n\r\nVasco Perez de Camoens, either brother or son of this Ruy, made a second\r\nmigration to Portugal in 1370. Faria y Sousa conjectures that it might\r\nbe from some such same cause as occasioned the first exile, while\r\nSouthey attributes it to his having sided with Pedro the Cruel against\r\nhis more infamous brother Henriquez II. However that may be, Fernando,\r\nking of Portugal, received him with distinction, and gifted him with the\r\n\"villas\" of Sardoal, Punhete, Maraõ, and Amendao, besides making him\r\none of the principal fidalgos of his court. Nor did the favours of\r\nFernando stop here. Vasco Perez received various other estates in gift,\r\nand filled places of political and military importance.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Fernando, Vasco Perez became involved in a dispute\r\nfor succession, and he upheld the cause of the queen of Fernando,\r\nLeonor, and his daughter, the queen of Castile. His power was great, and\r\nhis aid was held of importance, whichever side he espoused. Camoens\r\nconsidered that his ancestor assisted the wrong cause, that of Castile\r\nagainst Portugal. The latter was destined to triumph, and Vasco was the\r\nsufferer. He lost all command, but retained a considerable portion of\r\nhis estates. A letter has been discovered by Sarmiento, written by the\r\nmarquis of Santillana, which intimates that Vasco Perez was a poet as\r\nwell as a warrior.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of Vasco Perez were of account, and married into the\r\nrichest and most powerful families of Portugal. His second son, Joaõ\r\nVaz, was the great-grandfather of the poet. He acquired glory by his\r\nmilitary services under Alfonso V., and was named his _vassal_--a title\r\nof distinction in those days. He built a house at Coimbra, and there is\r\na marble monument erected to his memory in the chapel of the cloister of\r\nthe cathedral at Coimbra. Simaõ Vaz, the grandson of Joaõ Vaz, married\r\nDona Ana de Sa e Macedo, of noble descent, and sprung from the Macedos\r\nof Santarem. Thus, in every way, Camoens was highly descended from\r\nnobles and warriors; but, springing from the younger branch, he\r\ninherited the blood and name without the estates of his family. As he\r\nnever married this branch of the family became extinct.\r\n\r\nCoimbra and Santarem have both contended for the glory of having been\r\nhis birth-place, but without foundation; for he was born at Lisbon, most\r\nprobably in the district \"da Mouraria,\" in the parish of San Sebastiaõ,\r\nwhere his parents resided. The date of his birth has been disputed. A\r\nfriend and contemporary, Manoel Correa, gave that of 1517; but a\r\nregister, in the Portuguese India House, proves that he was really born\r\nin 1524.[129] This entry also is conclusive on another point. It was\r\nlong believed that Camoens lost his father while a mere child. Simon Vaz\r\nde Camoens was a mariner; nearly all the biographers of the poet agree\r\nin stating that he lost a ship, of which he was commander, on the coast\r\nof Goa, and, escaping from the wreck, died soon afterwards in that city;\r\nthough some aver that he fell in the combat in which his son lost an\r\neye. Camoens himself does not mention his father as being with him on\r\nthat occasion, nor during any of his adventures. This point, therefore,\r\nis left in obscurity.\r\n\r\nCamoens was born at Lisbon; he celebrates with fondness the parental\r\nTagus: \"My Tagus,\" as he sometimes names the river. But most of his\r\nearly years were spent at Coimbra, where, as has been mentioned, his\r\nfather had a house. He often mentions the river Mondego in his verses.\r\nTo a poet, there is something in a river that engages his affections and\r\nenlivens his imagination. Water is indeed the soul, the smile, the\r\nbeaming eye of a landscape; and as Camoens' only happy days were those\r\nwhen he nourished hopes--hopes, as he says in a letter, which he\r\nafterwards cast aside as coiners of false money--in his youth, he might\r\nwell record with fondness the hours he spent in the beautiful environs\r\nof Coimbra on the banks of its lovely river. Thus, in his poems, the\r\nnymphs of Tagus and of Mondego are both addressed; and in one remarkable\r\nand most beautiful passage of the \"Lusiad\" he exclaims, \"What, insane\r\nand rash, am I about to do without ye, O nymphs of Tagus and Mondego,\r\nthrough so arduous, long, and various a way? I invoke your favour, as I\r\nnavigate the deep sea with so contrary a wind, that, unless ye aid me, I\r\nfear that my fragile bark must sink!\" and then he goes on to describe\r\nhis misfortunes in India, turning to those streams that watered his\r\nnative land, and whose very names were full of blessed recollections of\r\nlife's prime, to give him fortitude and help.[130]\r\n\r\nCamoens studied in the university at Coimbra. This university was\r\nfounded by king Diniz, in 1308. Camoens introduces mention of this\r\nmonarch in the \"Lusiad,\" and alludes to the establishment of the\r\nuniversity under his fosterage:--\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Helicon the Muses wing their way:\r\nMondego's flowery banks invite their stay,\r\nNow Coimbra shines, Minerva's proud abode;\r\nAnd fired with joy, Parnassus' blooming God\r\nBeholds another dear-loved Athens rise,\r\nAnd spread her laurels in indulgent skies.[131]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe university, however, fell off, and it was don Manuel who exerted\r\nhimself for its re-establishment; and dom John, his successor, took\r\nequal pains to raise it to its former prosperity, and in the first place\r\ncaused it again to be restored to Coimbra--for it had been transferred\r\nto Lisbon--and founded several new colleges. The date when Camoens\r\nentered it is uncertain. It has been supposed that he was twelve years\r\nold. In that case he must have attended it while at Lisbon; for it was\r\nonly transferred in 1537[132] when Camoens was thirteen or fourteen.\r\n\r\nSaa de Miranda had studied there, and Ferreira was also a student. He\r\nwas younger than Camoens by four years, and that, at a boyish age, makes\r\nthe difference of, as it were, a generation. There is no token that they\r\nwere known to each other, nor, indeed, are there any traces of Camoens'\r\nlife or pursuits at Coimbra, except such as we find in his poems; and\r\nthese are in some sort contradictory--agreeing, however, in the love\r\nthey express for the picturesque scenery in which this seat of learning\r\nwas placed, and affection for its beautiful river.\r\n\r\nMr. Adamson quotes a canzone, in which he dwells with delight on the\r\ncharms of the Mondego, and dates thence his earliest passion. Lord\r\nStrangford asserts that he had never experienced the passion of love\r\nwhile at Coimbra, and rests his assertion on expressions of the poet.\r\nBoth of course are right, and the poet is wrong. Nor is this assertion\r\nparadoxical. When the heart of Camoens became susceptible to a master\r\nfeeling, that filled it and awoke its every pulse to a sense of love, he\r\nwould naturally wish to throw into the back-ground any boyish fancy; and\r\ncomparing its slight and evanescent emotions with the mighty passion of\r\nwhich he was afterwards the prey, he might well say,--\r\n\r\n\r\nAll ignorant of love I pass'd my days,\r\nIts bow and all its mad deceits despising,\r\n\r\n\r\nand revert to that period as the time,--\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen from the bonds of love I wander'd free--\r\nFor always was I not chain'd to the oar:--\r\nOnce liberty was mine--but that is o'er.\r\nAnd I now dwell in bard captivity.[133]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis certainly contrasts strangely with the poem quoted by Adamson, but\r\nit is a fair poetic licence, or rather a licence of the heart, which not\r\nonly would bring to its selected shrine every former emotion and\r\nimmolate them there, but is jealous that any such existed, and would\r\ngladly expunge all trace of them from the page of life. The verses above\r\nmentioned form his fourth canzone, and were written on taking leave of\r\nCoimbra.[134] The following is a portion of it:--\r\n\r\n\r\nSoft from its crystal bed of rest,\r\nMondego's tranquil waters glide,\r\nNor stop, till, lost on ocean's breast,\r\nThey, swelling, mingle with the tide.\r\nIncreasing still, as still they flow--\r\nAh! there commenced my endless woe.\r\n* * * * * * * * *\r\nYet whisper'd to the murmuring stream,\r\nThat winds these flowery meads among,\r\nI give affection's cheating dream,\r\nAnd pour in weeping truth my song;\r\nThat each recounted woe may prove\r\nA lasting monument of love.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another sonnet, in which he takes leave of the Mondego, but its\r\ncontext renders it apparent that it was not written so early in life, as\r\nwhen he first quitted the university. As his parents had a house at\r\nCoimbra, it may be assumed that he frequently visited this place, and\r\nwrote the following sonnet in a later and sadder day:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMondego! thou whose waters, cold and clear,\r\nGird those green banks, where fancy fain would stay,\r\nFondly to muse on that departed day,\r\nWhen hope was kind, and friendship seem'd sincere--\r\nEre I had purchased knowledge with a tear.--\r\nMondego! though I bend my pilgrim way\r\nTo other shores, where other fountains stray,\r\nAnd other rivers roll their proud career,\r\nStill, nor shall time, nor grief, nor stars severe,\r\nNor widening distance e'er prevail in aught,\r\nTo make thee less to this sad bosom dear;\r\nAnd Memory oft, by old affection taught,\r\nShall lightly speed upon the shrines of thought,\r\nTo bathe among thy waters cold and clear.[135]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so attractive to a biographer as to complete the\r\nfragments of his hero's life; and, almost as children trace the forms of\r\nanimals and landscapes in the fire, by fixing the eye on salient\r\nparticles, so a few words suffice to give \"local habitation and a name,\"\r\nto such emotions as the poet has made the subject of his verse. To do\r\nthis, and by an accurate investigation of dates, and a careful sifting\r\nof concomitant circumstances to discover the veiled event, is often the\r\nart of biography--but we must not be seduced too far. Truth, absolute\r\nand unshakeable, ought to be the foundation of our assertions, or we\r\npaint a fancy head instead of an individual portrait. Truth is all in\r\nall in matters of history, for history is the chart of the world's sea;\r\nand if imaginary lands are marked, those who would wisely learn from the\r\nexperience of others, are led sadly astray. Petrarch has been the mark\r\nof similar conjectures to a great extent; but his letters give a true\r\ndirection to our researches. We have no such guide in the history of\r\nCamoens's attachment. He loved and was beloved; was banished, and his\r\nlady died. Such is nearly all that we absolutely know.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1545.[136]\r\nÆtat.\r\n21.]\r\n\r\nTo return however from remark to history, Camoens left Coimbra for\r\nLisbon and the court. He had not lost his time at the University--he was\r\na finished scholar. He was a poet also then when poetry was held a high\r\nand divine gift. With such acquirements and accomplishments, joined to\r\nhis gentlemanly qualities, his courtesy and wit, he was favoured by the\r\nhighest people at court; his handsome person also gained him the favour\r\nand estimation of the ladies. His defect was his poverty, but that\r\ndefect might be remedied by the friendship of some great man, or the\r\nfavour of his sovereign. Asa young noble of illustrious descent, he had\r\na right to expect advancement. As a poet full of imagination and ardour,\r\nat the very first glowing entrance to life, while (to speak\r\nmetaphorically) the Aurora of hope announced the rising sun of\r\nprosperity, he might expect an ample portion of that happiness, which,\r\nwhile we are young, appears to us to be our just and assured\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nSoon after his arrival at court he fell in love. One of his sonnets,\r\n(commented upon by an almanack,) fixes the date when he first saw the\r\nlady, as the eleventh or twelfth of April, 1545. He mentions that it was\r\nholy week, and at the time when the ceremonies that commemorate the\r\ndeath of our Saviour were celebrated. This sonnet is not one of his\r\nbest; but we quote Lord Strangford's translation, as it is a monument of\r\nan interesting epoch--the commencement of that attachment which shed a\r\ndisastrous influence over the rest of his life--for by it his early\r\nhopes were blighted, and they never flowered again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sweetly was heard the anthem's choral strain,\r\nAnd myriads bow'd before the sainted shrine,\r\nIn solemn reverence to the Sire divine,\r\nWho gave the Lamb, for guilty mortals slain;\r\nWhen in the midst of God's eternal fane,\r\n(Ah, little weening of his fell design!)\r\nLove bore the heart, which since has ne'er been mine,\r\nTo one who seem'd of heaven's elected train!\r\nFor sanctity of place or time were vain\r\n'Gainst that blind Archer's soul-consuming power,\r\nWhich scorns, and soars all circumstance above.\r\nO! Lady, since I've worn thy gentle chain,\r\nHow oft have I deplored each wasted hour,\r\nWhen I was free and had not learn'd to love!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that this occurrence took place in the church of Christ's\r\nWounds, at Lisbon.[137] There is so much resemblance of time and place\r\nbetween this event and the first time when Petrarch records that he saw\r\nLaura, that we might almost suppose that the later poet imitated the\r\nearlier one; but there is no other resemblance between their attachment.\r\nThe name of the lady Camoens fell in love with, was dona Caterina de\r\nAtayde, and she was a lady of the palace. Many researches have been made\r\nto discover more of her parentage and station; dom Jose Maria de Sousa\r\nmade diligent search in the \"Historia da Casa Real;\" but he can do no\r\nmore than conjecture that she was a relation of dom Antonio de Atayde,\r\nthe first conde de Castanheira, a powerful favourite of John III. It is\r\nguessed that she was not more than sixteen when Camoens first saw her.\r\nShe was unmarried; his attachment therefore was totally unlike the\r\nPlatonic, far-off worship of the lover of Laura de Sades. Camoens loved\r\nas a youth who dedicates himself to one whom he may hope to make his own\r\nin the open face of day--with whom he might spend his life, as her\r\nprotector and husband; but she was of high birth, and her relations had\r\nlofty pretensions--a pennyless, though noble and accomplished gentleman\r\nby no means suited their views. The love of Camoens was full of\r\ndifficulties: his ardour was excited by them; and, while unassured of\r\nany return he was disposed to vanquish every obstacle for the sake of\r\nseeing, and endeavouring to win the heart of the beloved object.\r\n\r\nYouth and love aided the developement of a vivid imagination. There\r\nnever breathed a more genuine poet than Camoens, and now he poured forth\r\nhis soul in rhymes: canzoni and sonnets are dedicated to his lady,\r\ndescribing her beauty, his sufferings, and the deep affection he\r\nnourished. Notwithstanding the good old proverb, commentators are fond\r\nof instituting comparisons, and the amatory poetry of Petrarch and\r\nCamoens has been compared. Camoens had doubtless read and studied\r\nPetrarch, but in no respect does he imitate him. There is more finish in\r\nthe compositions of the Italian, and for this there is an obvious cause.\r\nWhile speaking slightingly of them, Petrarch was employed even in his\r\nlast days in the correction and polishing of his Italian poetry; while\r\nthe verses of Camoens, written in the first gush of inspiration, were\r\nnever collected by him, or if collected, the volume was lost: and\r\nscattered over Portugal and India, it was with difficulty they were\r\nbrought together, nor were they published till after his death, and some\r\nof those included in the collection are said not to be his.\r\n\r\nThere is a glow, a freshness, and a truth; a touching softness and a\r\nheart-felt eagerness, in his verses on dona Caterina, which is very\r\nwinning. The language he uses does not charm the ear like Italian, but\r\nit is capable of great melody and expression. We possess translations of\r\na small portion, but lyrics can never be translated; they have a _voice_\r\nof their own which cannot be transfused into another language. Lord\r\nStrangford's translations have this merit, that they read like original\r\npoetry--but something of truth has been sacrificed in consequence.\r\n\r\nIt is from these poems that we gather almost all we know of Camoens'\r\nattachment. As Petrarch did, he dedicates a sonnet to an emotion--which\r\nto a lover's heart seemed an event, or in a _canzone_, dwells at length\r\non the course of his passion. One sonnet which describes the lady, is a\r\ngreat favourite with the Portuguese: the translation is difficult; we\r\nquote the one given by Mr. Adamson--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Her Eye's soft movement, radiant and benign,\r\nYet with no casual glance; her honest smile,\r\nCautious though free;--her gestures that combine,\r\nLight mirth with modesty, as if the while\r\nShe stood all trembling o'er some doubtful bliss,\r\nHer blithe demeanour; her confiding ease,\r\nSecure in grave and virgin bashfulness,\r\nMidst every gentler virtue formed to please\r\nHer purity of soul--her innate fear\r\nOf error's stain; her temper mild, resigned;\r\nHer looks, obedience; her unclouded air,\r\nThe faithful index of a spotless mind;\r\nThese form a Circe, who with magic art\r\nCan fix or change each purpose of my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe describes her charms in many of his poems. Dona Caterina had mild\r\nblue eyes, and hair of a golden brown, and he dwells on the softness of\r\nthe former and the splendour of the latter with fond admiration; but the\r\npoem which expresses most fervently the influence of her beauty is one\r\nof which Dr. Southey has given a very exquisite translation, and which\r\nwe are irresistibly tempted to quote--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When I behold you. Lady, when my eyes\r\nDwell on the deep enjoyment of your sight,\r\nI give my spirit to that one delight,\r\nAnd earth appears to me a Paradise.\r\nAnd when I hear you speak and see you smile,\r\nFull, satisfied, absorbed, my centred mind\r\nDeems all the world's vain hopes and joys the while,\r\nAs empty as the unsubstantial wind.\r\nLady, I feel your charms, but dare not raise\r\nTo that high theme th' unequal song of praise;\r\nA power for that to language was not given:\r\nNor marvel I when I those beauties view,\r\nLady, that he whose power created you,\r\nCould form the stars and yonder glorious heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concluding lines of the above sonnet are conceived in the very truth\r\nof love and ardour of imagination that stamps the lyrics and sonnets of\r\nCamoens with a charm almost unequalled by any other poet.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles that were in the way of all intercourse with the lady\r\nmaddened his young and impatient spirit. Dona Caterina lived in the\r\npalace, and Camoens violated some rule of decorum in endeavouring to see\r\nher, and was exiled. We are not told what his fault was. Dona Caterina\r\nwas not insensible to his passion. He always speaks of her as mild and\r\nretiring--modest and gentle; he never complains of her haughtiness nor\r\nher pride: indeed, several of his sonnets speak of how oft he was happy\r\nand content, and of \"past sweet delights.\"[138] We do not venture too\r\nfar, therefore, in supposing that her relations discovered that she\r\nreturned her lover's attachment; and, as they were opposed to their\r\nbeing married, they used their influence to get the youthful and, as\r\nthey deemed, presumptuous aspirant, banished.\r\n\r\nLord Strangford speaks decidedly of a parting interview, when the\r\nhorrors of approaching exile were softened by finding his grief and his\r\nsorrow shared by her he loved. There indeed appears foundation for this,\r\nthough the noble biographer uses a few fancy tints, when, quoting the\r\ntwenty-fourth sonnet, he comments on it, by saying, \"On the morning of\r\nhis departure his mistress relented from her wonted severity, and\r\nconfessed the secret of her long concealed affection. The sighs of grief\r\nwere soon lost in those of mutual delight, and the hour of parting was\r\nperhaps the sweetest of our poet's existence.\" This may be true. The\r\npoet speaks of \"a mournful and a happy morning, overflowing with grief\r\nand pity\", which he desires should for ever be remembered, and he speaks\r\nof \"tears shed by other eyes than his.\"[139]\r\n\r\nCamoens appears to have passed his exile at Santarem (the native place\r\nof his mother), or in its neighbourhood. He was supremely unhappy;\r\nbanished from her he loved, banished from the court, where all his hopes\r\nof advancement, were centred, the gates of life were closed on him. His\r\ngenius and his poetical imagination were his only resource and comfort.\r\nHe wrote many of his lyrics and sonnets here, and among the rest a very\r\nbeautiful elegy, in which he compares himself to Ovid banished to\r\nPontus, and separated from the country and the friends he loved. He\r\ndwells on the Roman's misery, and proceeds--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thus Fancy paints me--thus like him forlorn,\r\nCondemn'd the hapless exile's fate to prove;\r\nIn life-consuming pain, thus doomed to mourn\r\nThe loss of all I prized--of her I love.\r\n\r\n\"Reflection paints me guiltless though opprest,\r\nIncreasing thus the sources of my woe;\r\nThe pang unmerited that rends the breast,\r\nBut bids a tear of keener sorrow flow.\r\n\r\n\"On golden Tagus' undulating stream[140]\r\nSkim the light barks by gentlest, wishes sped\r\nTrace their still way midst many a rosy gleam\r\nThat steals in blushes o'er its trembling bed.\r\n\r\n\"I see them gay, in passing beauty glide\r\nSome with fix'd sails to woo the tardy gale,\r\nWhile others with their oars that stream divide\r\nTo which I weeping tell the Exile's tale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this period also he is supposed to have conceived and begun the\r\nLusiad. Passionately fond of his country, and proud of her heroes, he\r\nbelieved it to be a glorious task to celebrate their deeds; and while\r\nhis heart warmed and his imagination was fired with such a subject, he\r\nmight hope that it would please his sovereign, and that his patriotic\r\nlabours would bear the fruit of some prosperity for himself. That he\r\nhoped much, we know, and felt all the confidence in eventual happiness\r\nwhich the young and ardent naturally feel is certain. How bitter and how\r\nblighting was the truth, that as it brought to light, piece by piece,\r\nyear by year, the course of his life, shewed only barren tracks, storms,\r\nand hardship--to end at last in abject wretchedness!\r\n\r\nThe gleams that a little irradiate the obscurity in which this portion\r\nof the life of Camoens is enveloped, shed a very doubtful light upon his\r\nmotives. Faria y Sousa says, that he returned to Lisbon, and was a\r\nsecond time exiled for the same cause, and then resolved on his\r\nexpedition to India. But there is no proof of his being banished a\r\nsecond time by any royal order.\r\n\r\nThe simple facts appear to be these. In 1545 he left the university and\r\nbegan life. He was twenty-one, ardent in his temper, high of hope, of an\r\naspiring but poetic temperament, that could bear all that called him\r\nforth to action and glory, but was impatient of obscurity, and the dull\r\nsleepy course of hopeless unvaried mediocrity of station and life. He\r\nloved, and he was banished.\r\n\r\nHis heart then spent itself in rhymes, and he conceived the idea of a\r\npoem which he deemed to be epic, which spoke of heroes, who were his\r\ncountrymen, who were but lately dead, and whose path to glory in the\r\neast he even saw open before himself. Five years were passed since he\r\nhad left Coimbra; he was still poor and unprotected: he resolved to be\r\nand to do something, and on this, formed the project of going to India.\r\nHe had formed an intimacy with dom Antonio de Noronha. Dom Alfonso de\r\nNoronha (who must have been some relation to this young noble) was at\r\nthis time named viceroy for India; and the entry in the Portuguese East\r\nIndian register shows that Camoens had taken his passage on board the\r\nsame vessel in which the viceroy sailed. From some reason, however, he\r\nchanged his intention. Dom Antonio was about to join the Portuguese army\r\nin Africa. His father had discovered an attachment between him and dona\r\nMargarita de Silva, a lady of high birth and great beauty, but from some\r\nunknown cause, not approving of it, he sent his son to Ceuta. Nothing\r\nwas more natural than that dom Antonio should solicit his friend to\r\naccompany him, instead of leaving his native country for the distant\r\nclime of India. Other commentators say that the father of Camoens was at\r\nthat time in Africa, and sent for his son; but facts tend to negative\r\nthis. We have seen that Simon Vaz was his son's surety on his projected\r\nvoyage, on board the Don Pedro; nor have we any facility afforded us of\r\nreconciling these contradictions.[141] There are several expressions in\r\nhis poems which indicate that the poet, though innocent, was obliged to\r\ngo to Africa.[142] These might allude to a paternal command, or simply\r\nto the evil fate that pursued him, driven by which, he might term that\r\nforce, which was only a strongly impelling motive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1550.\r\nÆtat.\r\n20.]\r\n\r\nWhile with the troops at Ceuta, Camoens was actively employed, and\r\ndisplayed great bravery on various occasions; on one, he was destined to\r\nbe a great sufferer, as he lost an eye in a naval engagement which took\r\nplace in the straits of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nLike Cervantes, Camoens fought for his country and was mutilated in her\r\nwars, and received neither reward nor preferment. After passing some\r\ntime in the burning clime of Africa, he returned to Lisbon; but no\r\nbetter fortune awaited him. He returned, deprived of an eye, and the\r\nunfortunate mutilation rendered him an object of ridicule to those very\r\nladies who, eight years before, when he was in the prime of youth and\r\nbeauty, had welcomed him with distinction. At this period, the\r\nbiographers state that the object of his faithful and passionate\r\nattachment died: this seems a mistake, as we shall afterwards mention;\r\nbut he was divided from her by obstacles as insurmountable as death. His\r\nfather was no more. He had sailed to India as commander of a vessel, was\r\nwrecked on the Malabar coast, and, escaping from the wreck, arrived at\r\nGoa; but did not long survive the loss of his fortunes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1553.\r\nÆtat.\r\n29.]\r\n\r\nCamoens cast hope to the winds, and embarked for India. Stricken by\r\ndisappointment, rendered despairing by hopeless love--his wearied fancy\r\ncould build no more airy fabrics of future good fortune to which to\r\nescape during the tedious or fearful hours of a long and dangerous\r\nvoyage. His resource was his poem. He occupied himself with the Lusiad;\r\nand, doubtless, found in the glow of inspiration, and in the exercise of\r\nhis imagination, some relief from sorrow and care, while traversing\r\nthose stormy and distant seas, which the heroes of his epic had before\r\nsailed over, even though he went towards\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That long desired and distant land, which is\r\nThe grave of every poor and honest man.\"[143]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sailed in the San Bento, in which the commodore Fernando Alvares\r\nCabral, who commanded the fleet then going to the east, also embarked.\r\nIt was the only one of the squadron that reached its destination; the\r\nrest being destroyed by tempests. It reached Goa in the September of the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nThen Camoens visited India the glorious days of Portugal were at an end.\r\nAlbuquerque, Almeida, and the heroic Pacheco, who like a fabulous\r\nPaladin, withstood whole armies with his single arm, and who died\r\nunregarded and unnoticed by his ungrateful sovereign in a hospital in\r\nLisbon, were no more; the disinterestedness, the honour and humanity,\r\nthat distinguished the administration of Albuquerque, was not imitated\r\nby his successors. He had taken Goa, and founded an empire, which the\r\ncorrupt government of Portugal has caused us to inherit. The local\r\ngovernors too often sought only to enrich themselves; the viceroys were\r\ninvolved in wars occasioned by their tyranny and extortion; and that\r\nwhich Albuquerque intended should be a political and vast dominion\r\ntributary to his native land, sunk into mere commercial or piratical\r\nspeculations. In the same way, the trade with China was stained by\r\noppressions and rapine.\r\n\r\nDom Alfonso de Noronha was still viceroy on Camoens' arrival. He was\r\navaricious and tyrannical. At this time the king of Cochin had applied\r\nto the Portuguese for protection against the king of Pimenta. An\r\narmament was sent in November; and Camoens, without giving himself time\r\nto repose from his long voyage, accompanied it. The artillery of the\r\nPortuguese gained for them a signal victory, and the king of Cochin soon\r\nsued for peace. \"We were to retale an island,\" Camoens writes in his\r\nfirst elegy, \"belonging to the king of Porca, and which the king of\r\nPimenta had seized; and we were successful. We departed from Goa with a\r\nlarge armament, which comprised all the forces there, collected together\r\nby the viceroy. With little trouble we destroyed the quiver-armed\r\npeople, and punished them with death and fire. We were detained in the\r\nisland only two days, which was the last for some, who passed the cold\r\nwaters of Styx.\"\r\n\r\nThus he enrolled his name at once among those adventurers who sought by\r\ntheir gallantry to conquer fortune, and to acquire prosperity and\r\nreputation by the sword. Camoens was full of military ardour, but he was\r\na poet, and his disposition was gentle as it was fearless; and Southey\r\nwell observes, that his better nature induced him, while recording this\r\nvictory, to envy those happier men whose lives were spent in the\r\nexercise of the arts of peace.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Goa, he was saddened by the news of the death of his\r\nyoung and dear friend, dom Antonio de Noronha. He perished in an\r\nengagement with the Moors, near Tetuan, on the 18th of April, 1553.\r\nAntonio had been driven from his native country to fall in the\r\ndestructive African wars, through the obduracy of his father. He was\r\nmiserable in his exile; as Camoens pathetically describes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But while his tell-tale cheek the cause betrays,\r\nTo him who marks it with affection's eye,\r\nAnd speaks in silence to a father's gaze\r\nThe fatal strength of love's resistless sigh;\r\nParental art, resolved, alas! to prove\r\nThe stronger power of absence over love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUnimaginative people fancy that when a poet laments in song; his heart\r\nis cold. How false this is, persons even of the chilliest fancy can\r\njudge if they call to mind, how, in times of vehement affliction, they\r\nare more alive, and the world is more alive to them, in images that hear\r\nupon their grief, than during periods of monotony. The act of writing\r\nmay compose the mind; but the boiling of the soul, and quake of heart,\r\nthat precede, transcend all the sufferings which tame spirits feel.\r\nCamoens wrote a sonnet[144] and an elegy on this loss, which he sent in\r\na letter to a friend.\r\n\r\n\"I wish so much for a letter from you,\" he says in this letter, \"that I\r\nfear that my wishes balked themselves--for it is a trick of fortune to\r\ninspire a strong desire for the very purpose of disappointing it. But as\r\nI would not have such wrong done me, as that you should suspect that I\r\ndo not remember you, I determined to remind you by this, in which you\r\nwill see little more or less than that I wish you to write to me from\r\nyour native land; and in anticipated payment I send you news from this,\r\nwhich will do no harm at the bottom of a box, and may serve as a word of\r\nadvice to other adventurers, that they may learn that every country\r\ngrows grass. When I left Portugal, as one bound for another world, I\r\nsent all the hopes I had nourished, with a crier before them, to be\r\nhanged, as coiners of false money, and I freed myself from all the\r\nthoughts of home, so that there might not remain in me one stone upon\r\nanother. Thus situated, in the midst of uncertainty and confusion, the\r\nlast words I uttered were those of Scipio Africanus--'Ingrata patria,\r\nnon possidebis ossa mea.' For without having committed any sin that\r\nwould doom me to three days of purgatory, I have endured three-thousand\r\nfrom evil tongues, worse intentions, and wicked designs, born of mere\r\nenvy,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"to view\r\nTheir darling ivy, torn from them, take root\r\nAgainst another wall.\"[145]\r\n\r\n\r\nEven friendships softer than wax have been warmed into hatred and set\r\nalight, whence my fame has received more blisters than the crackling of\r\na roasted pig. Thus they found in my skin the valour of Achilles, who\r\ncould only be wounded at the sole of the foot; for they were never able\r\nto see mine, though I forced many to show theirs. In short, Senhor, I\r\nknow not how to thank myself for having escaped all the snares with\r\nwhich circumstances surrounded me in that country, except by coming to\r\nthis, where I am more respected than the bulls of Merciana[146], and\r\nlive more peacefully than in the cell of friar. This country, I say,\r\nwhich is the mother of rascals, and the mother-in-law of honest men. For\r\nthose who seek to enrich themselves float like bladders on the water;\r\nbut those whose inclinations lead them to deeds on arms, are thrown, as\r\nthe tide throws dead bodies on shore, to be dried up first, and then to\r\ndecay.\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to speak of the women. The Portuguese whom he finds\r\nthere, he says, are old; and of the natives he dislikes their\r\nlanguage--\"for if you address them,\" he continues, \"in the style of\r\nPetrarch and Boscan, they reply in a language so sown with tares, that\r\nit sticks in the throat of the understanding, and would throw cold water\r\non the most burning flame in the world. And now no more, Senhor, than\r\nthis sonnet, which I wrote on the death of dom Antonio de Noronha, which\r\nI send as a mark of how much it grieved me. I wrote an eclogue on the\r\nsame subject, which appears to me the best I have written. I wished also\r\nto send it to Miguel Diaz, who would be glad to see it, on account of\r\nhis great friendship for dom Antonio, but being occupied by the many\r\nletters I have to write to Portugal, I have no time.\"\r\n\r\nCamoens could not remain inactive; he had left a country which,\r\nnotwithstanding all he had suffered, he fondly loved, because no career\r\nwas open to him. He sought one in India, and when none presented itself,\r\nhe cast himself in the first expedition set on foot, however dangerous\r\nor tedious it promised to be, and with all the bravery and ardour of his\r\nsoul, using both pen and sword, endeavoured to fight or write himself\r\ninto reputation and preferment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1554.\r\nÆtat.\r\n30.]\r\n\r\nThe year following his arrival at Goa, Noronha was succeeded in his\r\nviceroyalty by dom Pedro Mascarenhas, who soon after died, and Francisco\r\nBarreto acted as governor. The cruising of the Mahometans in the straits\r\nof Mecca was very detrimental to the Portuguese trade, and expeditions\r\nwere sent out to protect the merchantmen, under the command of Manoel de\r\nVasconcellos. On the second occasion, Camoens offered to serve as\r\nvolunteer, and accompanying Vasconcellos, shared the great hardships of\r\nthe expedition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1555.\r\nÆtat.\r\n31.]\r\n\r\nOn his return to Goa, he wrote a most beautiful _canzone_, the ninth,\r\ndescriptive of the wretchedness he endured, in which he pourtrays that\r\ncorner of the world, \"neighbouring a barren, rocky, sterile mountain;\r\nuseless, bare, bald and shapeless, abhorred of nature, where no bird\r\nflies, nor wild beast crouches--where no stream flows, nor any fountain\r\nsprings, and whose name is Felix. Here my hapless fortune placed me;\r\nhere, in this remote, rugged, and rocky part of the world, did fortune\r\nwill that a short space of my short life should be spent, that it might\r\nbe scattered in pieces about the world; here I wasted my sad, solitary,\r\nand sterile days, full of hardship, grief, and resentment; nor had I, as\r\nmy only adversaries, life, a burning sun, and chilling waters, a thick\r\nand sultry atmosphere, — but also my own thoughts. They assailed me,\r\nbringing the memory of some passed and brief delight, which once was\r\nmine when I inhabited the world, to double the asperity of my adversity,\r\nby showing me that many happy hours may be enjoyed; and thus, in these\r\nthoughts, I wore out time and life.\"\r\n\r\nCamoens returned to Goa, only to again encounter the enmity of fate and\r\nmalice of men. It was natural for him, to behold with indignation and\r\ncontempt the extortion and tyranny of the Portuguese government; and he\r\nis said to have been excited by these feelings to express his dislike of\r\nvarious individuals that composed it in a satire, which he named\r\n\"Follies in India,\" (_Disparates na India_), in which, in general terms,\r\nhe lashes many potent individuals for their misdeeds. This made him\r\nenemies; and being suspected of composing another satire, still more\r\ndistasteful to several who were named in it, as instituting a feast of\r\ncanes in honour of the new governor, and getting drunk on the occasion;\r\nthe persons aggrieved, fearing Camoens' sword as well as his pen,\r\napplied for redress to Barreto, and he was glad of the pretence to\r\narrest and banish him to China[147]; or rather, Southey says, we should\r\nexpress it, ordered him to another station; but this is often the worst\r\nexile; when a man has sought a new country, where he has friends and\r\nprospects, it is an arbitrary and cruel act that drives him out to seek\r\nhis fortune on unknown shores, where he arrives a stranger, and may be\r\nlooked on as an intruder; his name already stigmatised by the very\r\ncircumstances of his removal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1556.\r\nÆtat.\r\n32.]\r\n\r\nCamoens departed from Goa in the fleet which Barreto despatched to the\r\nSouth. He felt this arbitrary act bitterly. He denounced it as unjust,\r\nand went, he says, \"loaded with his recollections, his sorrows, and his\r\nfortunes, which were for ever adverse.\" He disembarked, at first, at one\r\nof the Molucca Isles; Ternate, as it is supposed: the term of his stay\r\nthere is uncertain, but there is every reason to suppose that he soon\r\nproceeded to Macao.[148] He here held the office of \"Provedor dos\r\nDefunctos,\" or commissary for the effects of the deceased; and here\r\nagain we find a similarity with Cervantes, who was driven to maintain\r\nhimself by accepting a clerkship; but in this Camoens was more fortunate\r\nthan the Spaniard; the situation he held was of greater emolument, and\r\nhe amassed a little fortune while holding it[149]; nor was it a place\r\nthat demanded much time for the fulfilment of its duties. Camoens found\r\nleisure to retire from the details of business, and to pursue his\r\npoetical occupations. He was wont to spend much time in a grotto which\r\ncommanded a view of the sea, and where, apart from the rest of the\r\nworld, he wrote a great portion of the \"Lusiad.\" This spot is still\r\nshown to strangers who visit Macao, as the grotto of Camoens; and an\r\nEnglish visitor thus describes it: \"It is pleasantly situated on the\r\nwestern shore of the promontory of Macao, and faces the harbour, which\r\ndivides it on that side from the main land. This promontory is a narrow\r\nneck of land, whose stony and barren surface is only rendered habitable\r\nby the sea breezes, that blow from three quarters of the compass, and\r\nsomewhat temper the natural heat of the climate.\" At this day, the\r\nEnglish possessor has beautified it by a plantation of trees, and\r\ncrowned it with a small Chinese temple, built on the rock, which is a\r\nsort of cromlech; the excavation beneath is the cave, or natural grotto,\r\nto which the poet resorted, bare in itself, but commanding a beautiful\r\nand extensive view:--\"the wide sea flecked with verdant isles, the\r\nharbour busy with vessels, the line of woody and cultivated coast,\r\nbounded by the majestic Montagna, whose pyramidical form and dark aspect\r\nadd no small charm to the scenery.\"\r\n\r\nHere Camoens continued the \"Lusiad;\" here Southey supposes that the\r\nhappiest years of his life were spent. It may be so, but airy and\r\ncameleon-like must that happiness have been. His imagination, his desire\r\nof fame, the grasp he held of it, as he added to his immortal work,\r\ndoubtless often fired his soul with that rapture which poets only know;\r\nand, as he gathered together some of the world's pelf, he might dream of\r\ndona Caterina, of his native Lisbon, and hope to make her his own when\r\nhe should return; he could look upon the sky and sea, and the beautiful\r\nearth, and feel the loveliness of the creation breathe peace and love\r\naround him. But still he was exiled and he was alone; his food was hope;\r\nfar off expectation, and that too of blessings, which he was never\r\ndoomed to possess; and as doubtless the human soul does unconsciously\r\nreceive shadows or sunbeams from the future, so his melancholy mood may\r\noften have made him wonder, why on an earth so lovely; beneath so\r\nsublime a heaven, he should be doomed to solitude and misfortune.\r\n\r\nThus several years were passed. Whatever the emoluments of his place\r\nwere, or whatever fortune it was that he amassed, or whatever were the\r\ncharms of his abode, they did not seduce him to stay a day longer than\r\nhe was obliged. He obtained leave to return to Goa from, or was invited\r\nto do so by, dom Costantino de Braganza, the new viceroy, who had known\r\nand entertained friendship for him in Portugal. He embarked carrying\r\nwith him his little fortune. But here fate at once displayed her\r\nunmitigated persecution; he was wrecked at the mouth of the river Mecon,\r\nand with difficulty reached the shore; carrying in one hand the\r\nmanuscript of his poem, while he swam with the other. Every thing else\r\nthat he possessed in the world was lost.[150]\r\n\r\nCamoens was kindly received by the natives who lived on the banks of the\r\nMecon; though he says of them with some scorn--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The near inhabitants brutishly think\r\nThat pain and glory, after this life's end\r\nEven brute creatures of each kind attend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nyet this very belief may have made them more sympathetic and charitable.\r\n\r\nHe remained on this coast for a few days after his wreck. And here all\r\ncommentators agree that he wrote what are called his marvellous and\r\ninimitable rendondilhas, which commence by an allusion to the Hebrew\r\npsalm of exile, \"By the waters of Babylon.\" Southey rejects absolutely\r\nthe possibility that this beautiful poem could have been written at such\r\nan hour of tumult and uncertainty, and brings as proof, that not only,\r\nhe does not mention his wreck, nor the kindness he received, for which\r\nhe evidently felt grateful, but speaks of himself as living in exile.\r\n\r\nHe soon pursued his voyage to Goa, where the viceroy received him with\r\nkindness and distinction; and hope might dawn again upon his heart, and\r\nhe might expect preferment under dom Constantine de Braganza's\r\npatronage, who loved him as a friend. But we are almost forced to\r\nbelieve in the influence of a star, and that which ruled the fate of\r\nCamoens was full of storm and wreck, and miserable reverses. Dom\r\nConstantine, with whose viceroyalty, Faria tells us, ended all good\r\ngovernment in India, the succeeding governors being unable to stem the\r\ntide and avarice of extortion, was soon replaced by don Francisco de\r\nCoutinho, Conde de Redondo. The poet's enemies took advantage of this\r\nchange to urge against him an accusation of malversation in the exercise\r\nof his office at Macao. Don Francisco was said to be the friend and\r\nadmirer of the poet, but Mickle, in reprobating his general character,\r\naccuses him also of deceit towards Camoens--at least he afforded him no\r\nprotection on this occasion, and this thrice unhappy man was thrown into\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh canto of the Lusiad, the poet breaks off suddenly in the\r\nnarrative, as if oppressed by the sense of his own woes; and, forced to\r\ngive a voice to the anguish that wrung his soul, he recalls images of\r\nhome and bids them assuage the bitterness of his grief, while he\r\nrecapitulates the various disasters he had sustained--exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But, O, blind man\r\nI! that, unwise and rude, without your clue,\r\nNymphs of Mondego and the Tagan stream,\r\nA course so long, so intricate, pursue.\r\nI launch into a boundless ocean,\r\nWith wind so contrary, that unless you\r\nExtend your favours, I have cause to think\r\nMy brittle bark will in a moment sink.\r\n\r\nBehold, how long, whilst I strain all my powers\r\nYour Tagus singing, and your Portugal,\r\nFortune, new toils presenting and new sours,\r\nThrough the world drags me at her chariot's tail:\r\nSometimes committed to sea's rolling towers,\r\nSometimes to bloody dangers martial!\r\nThus I, like desperate Canace of old,\r\nMy pen in this, my sword in that hand hold.\r\n\r\nNow by declined and scorned poverty\r\nDegraded, at another's board to eat;\r\nNow in possession of a fortune high,\r\nThrown back again, farther than ever yet;\r\nNow 'scaped, with my life only, which hung by\r\nA single thread, even that a load too great;\r\nThat 'tis no less a wonder I am here,\r\nThan Judah's king's new lease of fifteen year.\r\n\r\nNay more, my Nymphs, I thus being made an isle\r\nAnd rock of want, surrounded by my woes,\r\nThe same, whom I swam, singing all the while,\r\nGave me for all my verses, but coarse prose:\r\nInstead of hoped rest for long exile.\r\nOr bays, to crown my head which bald now grows,\r\nUnworthy scandals they thereon did hail,\r\nWhich laid me in a miserable jail.[151]\r\n\r\n\r\nCamoens was easily enabled to prove the falsehood of the charges of\r\nwhich he was accused. And he would have been set free, but Miguel\r\nRodrigues Coutinho, a man of wealth and consequence, but nicknamed\r\nFios-seccos, detained him in prison for a trifling debt; not more, at\r\nthe very largest computation, than twenty pounds. He petitioned for his\r\nrelease from the viceroy in some sportive verses, in which he ridicules\r\nthe character of his creditor. The request was such as a man in\r\nadversity might prefer to a friend in power, without humiliation; and\r\nthough the biographers are chary of attributing the merit of his release\r\nto the viceroy, and Mickle even asserts that he owed it \"to the shame\r\nfelt by the gentlemen of Goa,\" it seems likely that dom Francisco did\r\nshew his friendship by enlarging him.\r\n\r\nHe continued in India, and pursued his military career as a volunteer.\r\nOn all occasions he displayed undaunted bravery; and his companions in\r\narms loved him for the heroic as well as cheerful spirit which he\r\ndisplayed in all reverses, and during every hardship.\r\n\r\nAt this period he is supposed to have heard of the death of dona\r\nCatarina de Atayde[152], who, in her grave, was not more lost to him\r\nthan on earth, while such far seas lay between them; yet the thought of\r\nher was dear and consolatory. When recording that two blows befell him\r\nat the same time, the one the loss of fortune, he continues:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And greater ill--the other blow destroyed\r\nThe gentle one, whom I so deeply loved,\r\nPerpetual Recollection of my soul!\"[153]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Catarina's story we may say, as Shakspeare's Viola does of her own\r\nhistory, it was \"a blank.\" She loved, she wept, she died. Her lover won\r\nher heart, and then was driven by fate to other lands at an immeasurable\r\ndistance, and the course of long years promised no return. He fondly\r\nlaments and commemorates her loss in poems which breathe tenderness and\r\nlove in all its purity and truth.[154] He addressed her in that heaven\r\nwhich she had reached, and adjured her:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Prefer thy prayer\r\nTo God, who took thee early to his rest,\r\nThat it may please him soon amid the blest\r\nTo summon me, dear maid, to meet thee there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had lost all; poverty clung to him, and the last hope of seeing her\r\nhe loved again, was taken away. Fame and glory only remained. His poem\r\nwas finished; and weary of hard services in wars--whose objects he\r\ncondemned, and in reward for which he received but the slender pay of a\r\nvolunteer--he desired to return to his native country, to publish his\r\npoem, and to receive the welcome of his friends, and perhaps the reward\r\nof his sovereign. He had left Portugal with an embittered spirit; but\r\nhis misfortunes in India made him turn with a longing eye to his native\r\nland, where he might hope that his enemies would cease to persecute him,\r\nand he obtain favour from his sovereign.\r\n\r\nPedro Barreto (a name unlucky for the poet) was appointed governor of\r\nSofala, in the Mozambique, and invited Camoens to accompany him. Whether\r\nhe offered him an office, or only allured him with the hope of\r\nfacilitating his return to Portugal, Sofala being on the way, we are not\r\ntold. It seems likely that Camoens went, induced by the latter motive,\r\nand trusting to the friendship of a low-minded and hard-hearted man.\r\nArrived at Sofala, he obtained no situation; it was his place to dine at\r\nthe governor's table, to follow in his train, and to tell the world that\r\nhe, a gallant soldier and a poet, who inherited immortality, was the\r\ndependant of Pedro Barreto. His proud spirit revolted, and he was\r\ncontent to endure the extreme of poverty, rather than play the servile\r\npart of parasite and hanger-on. It is probable that some absolute\r\nquarrel ensued, or at least that Barreto was so ill pleased with the\r\nindependent deportment of the man whom he believed that he held in his\r\npower, that he expressed his dissatisfaction with an insolence which\r\nCamoens resented. At this juncture some of his Indian friends arrived in\r\nthe Santa Fé; they found him in a most deplorable condition, dependent\r\non others for his subsistence; in want of clothes and every necessary.\r\nThey supplied his wants, and invited him to accompany them, a proposal\r\nCamoens gladly accepted; when the dastardly and malevolent Barreto\r\nrefused to permit his departure, until he had been paid 200 ducats,\r\nwhich he alleged he had spent in his behalf. The newly-arrived\r\ngentlemen, indignant at this meanness, were only the more eager to\r\nrescue their friend out of such a person's hands: they subscribed the\r\nmoney, and as Faria expresses it, \"ransomed him; so that at the same\r\ntime the person of Luis Camoens, and the reputation of Pedro Barreto,\r\nwere bought and sold at the same price;\" and if, as men of genius and\r\nvirtue fondly think, renown for good or ill in this world is an\r\nacquisition to be sought, or to be avoided, even with the loss of life,\r\nPedro Barreto, as he counted his paltry ducats, had better have cast\r\nthem and himself into the sea, than have put them into his pocket; but\r\neven the sea could not have washed out the stain of moral infamy. These\r\nfriends of Camoens were cavaliers, who loved literature and honoured the\r\nwriter. Their names have been preserved: Hector da Sylveira, Duarte de\r\nAbreu, Diogo de Couto, Antonio Cabral, Antonio Serram, and Luis de\r\nVeyga. He was the intimate friend of Hector da Sylveira, who showed\r\nhimself the most active and friendly, and who contributed the largest\r\nshare to the payment of the debt, even if he did not, as has been\r\nasserted, pay the whole. Sylveira is mentioned in a Barmecide feast,\r\nCamoens describes as having given at Goa; and they composed redondillhas\r\nand other light verses together. The reputation of Couto is known. He\r\nwas an historian of great merit.\r\n\r\nCamoens felt keenly the depth of adversity in which he had sunk. \"Oh,\r\nhow long drawn out,\" he exclaims in a sonnet, \"year by year, is my weary\r\npilgrimage! I go hastening towards age, while my ills increase; every\r\nbright hope becomes a dark deceit, and I follow a good which I never\r\nreach. I fail midway in the path, yet falling a thousand times, I have\r\nstill hoped.\" And in another, driven by despair into feelings unlike his\r\nnatural ones, he asks, \"where he may find a desert place, unvisited even\r\nby the brute creation; some gloomy wood or darksome forest--a place as\r\ndismal as his own thoughts, wherein to dwell for ever!\"\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage home, however, his spirit revived, refreshed by the\r\nkindness and admiration of his friends. They read, they praised, and\r\nanticipated success for the \"Lusiad.\" Couto wrote a commentary on it,\r\nwhich was unfortunately lost; and the same writer tells us that Camoens\r\nemployed himself, on the passage, in composing a work of great erudition\r\nand philosophy, which he entitled \"Parnasso de Luis Camoens,\" and which\r\nCouto says was stolen from him, and irretrievably lost. Late\r\ncommentators suppose that this must have been a collection of his minor\r\npoems: but as Couto speaks of its erudition, and had read it, he would\r\nhave been aware of this, and expressed himself differently.\r\n\r\nThe sanguine spirit of the poet, to whom kindness was medicine, and the\r\nhope of fame the dearest joy, again dared look forward--again he\r\ntrusted.\r\n[Sidenote: 1569.\r\nÆtat.\r\n45.]\r\nA young and gallant monarch had just ascended the throne, and he hoped\r\nto propitiate his favour by his patriotic work. The moment of his\r\nlanding, however, was unfavourable; for the plague was raging at Lisbon,\r\nand the minds of even the great and prosperous were absorbed by the fear\r\nof death. The political state of the kingdom was also disadvantageous.\r\nSebastian had succeeded to the crown when only three years old. The\r\nqueen, Catherine of Austria, had been appointed regent by the will of\r\nthe late king; but the cardinal Henrique, uncle to the infant sovereign,\r\nso disgusted her with his intrigues, that she resigned her power in his\r\nfavour. Henrique did not show himself unworthy of the trust; but as\r\nSebastian grew up, the courtiers around him were eager that he should\r\ntake the government of the kingdom into his own hands. Sebastian's own\r\nheart was set on military glory and conquests in Africa: a project\r\nfavoured by all the young and ambitious, and deprecated by the\r\nexperienced, who saw only a useless expenditure of life and money in the\r\ndesign. The cardinal, meanwhile, endeavoured to prolong his sway.\r\nCamoens must have found it difficult to trim his sail between the actual\r\npower of the cardinal and the anticipated influence of the favourites of\r\nthe king. He wrote the verses in which he dedicates his poem to the\r\nyoung monarch; he corrected and polished it; but the publication\r\nlingered, and it was two years after his return to his native country\r\nbefore it appeared. It was hailed with enthusiasm, and reprinted within\r\nthe year.\r\n[Sidenote: 1571.\r\nÆtat.\r\n47.]\r\nThe king heard of it, it is said, and granted the poet a pension of\r\n15,000 reis--about five pounds sterling--and required him to live within\r\nthe precincts of the court, and obtain its payment half-yearly. A\r\nsoldier who had fought as Camoens had done for his country, would have\r\nhad his sufferings and mutilation better rewarded. It has been\r\nimpossible to discover what occasioned the paltriness of the grant; if,\r\nindeed, it was not his half-pay as a military man, rather than a pension\r\ngiven to the poet. Some commentators fancy that the cardinal scowled on\r\nthe poem, as likely to excite the martial ardour of the king, which he\r\nwished to repress. This fear almost seems to have gone the length of\r\nwithholding the book altogether; for had Sebastian read the poem, he\r\nwould surely have found in it a voice that echoed the emotions of his\r\nown heart, and would have regarded its writer with more favour; and when\r\nhe sailed on his ill-fated expedition to Africa, and selected Diego\r\nBernardes to accompany him as his poet, he would rather have chosen a\r\nman who could so well achieve and so well describe deeds of arms, as\r\nCamoens had proved that he could do.[155]\r\n\r\nBut in mentioning this we anticipate. Sebastian did not undertake his\r\nfatal expedition until the lapse of several years. Meanwhile the darkest\r\nshadows clouded the poet's fate. No court favour, no preferment was\r\nextended to him. Her he loved was dead; his poem was finished,\r\npublished, read, admired; yet it proved barren of any advantage, except\r\nwhat he must have felt to be empty reputation, to its unfortunate\r\nwriter. The poetry of his life faded before realities the most\r\nheartbreaking and oppressive. He continued to reside at Lisbon. He did\r\nnot write, for he had fallen into a state of ill-health, the consequence\r\nof the many hardships he had endured, and the climate of India. He\r\nlived, he says, \"in the knowledge of many, and the society of few.\" He\r\nenjoyed the acquaintance and conversation of some learned men, who\r\nbelonged to the convent of S. Domingos de Lisboa, near which he lived.\r\n\r\nThe most melancholy circumstances attended his last days. He was sick\r\nand poor; his very life was supported by charity. His servant Antonio, a\r\nnative of Java, by whom some say his life was saved when wrecked on the\r\ncoast of Cochin, whom he had brought with him from India, was accustomed\r\nto steal out at night, and beg for bread, to support his miserable\r\nmaster during the following day.\r\n\r\nWhile in this afflicting state, a fidalgo, Ruy Diaz de Camara, paid him\r\na visit in his wretched dwelling, to complain that he had not fulfilled\r\na promise which the poet had made of translating the penitential psalms.\r\nCamoens regarded with resentment the man who could urge him to write\r\nwhile starving. \"When I wrote those verses,\" he replied, \"I was young,\r\nwell off, and in love; I possessed the affection of many friends, and\r\nwas favoured of ladies, which imparted a poetic fire. Now I have neither\r\nspirit nor peace of mind for any thing. There stands my Javanese, who\r\nasks me for two pieces, to buy fuel, and I have none to give him.\" We\r\nare told, though it seems incredible, that \"the cavalier closed his\r\nheart and purse and quitted the room.\" Thus shewing himself as\r\nbase-minded as he was silly. Yet even in this state, so keen and\r\npatriotic were the poet's feelings, that his illness is said to have\r\nbeen increased by the tidings of Sebastian's overthrow and death in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nProphesying that the ruin of his country would result from this defeat,\r\nhe says, in a letter written at that time,--\"At least I shall die with\r\nit!\"--and this sad reflection was a consolation. Southey conjectures\r\nthat those friends who were kindest to him perished in this defeat, and\r\nthat thus he lost that aid which had hitherto stood between him and\r\nabsolute want.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1778.\r\nÆtat.\r\n54.]\r\n\r\nAt length illness and suffering reduced him to so low a state that he\r\nwas incapable of all exertion. He felt that his death was near, and, as\r\na last effort, he expressed in a letter some of the bitter feelings\r\nexcited by the miserable circumstances with which it came attended.\r\n[Sidenote: 1779.\r\nÆtat.\r\n55.]\r\n\"Who ever heard,\" he says, \"that fortune should wish to represent such\r\nvast misfortunes on the little theatre of a poor bed! and I, as if they\r\nwere not sufficient, make myself her ally; for it would appear\r\neffrontery to attempt to resist such ill.\"\r\n\r\nBut the last scene was saddest of all. He breathed his last in an\r\nhospital. The month and day of his decease are alike unknown. The sheet\r\nin which he was shrouded was the gift of a noble, Don Francisco de\r\nPortugal, whose name deserves no praise for so meagre an offering to the\r\ndead, whose life a small portion of wealth might have rendered easy. A\r\nmoralising monk watched his last hours. \"How miserable a thing,\" he\r\nwrites, \"to see so great a genius so ill rewarded! I saw him die in a\r\nhospital at Lisbon, without possessing a shroud to cover his remains,\r\nafter having borne arms victoriously in India, and having sailed 5500\r\nleagues:--a warning for those who weary themselves by studying night and\r\nday without profit, as the spider who spins his web to catch\r\nflies.\"[156]\r\n\r\nAfter his death his body was removed to the church of Santa Anna, where\r\nhe was interred; but no tomb or monumental inscription marked the spot,\r\ntill sixteen years after his death, don Gonçalo Coutinho placed a stone\r\nto his memory, with this inscription--\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE LIES LOUIS DE CAMOENS,\r\nPRINCE OF THE POETS OF HIS TIME.\r\nHE LIVED POOR AND MISERABLE,\r\nAND THUS DIED,\r\nIN THE YEAR MDLXXIX.\r\n\r\nD. GONÇALO COUTINHO ORDERED\r\nTHIS STONE TO BE PLACED HERE,\r\nUNDER WHICH\r\nNO OTHER PERSON SHOULD BE BURIED.[157]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are told that Camoens was handsome in person; and Faria y Sousa\r\nspeaks of him as elegant and prepossessing in person before he went to\r\nIndia. Hardships and disappointments on his return bowed him down,\r\ndestroyed his cheerfulness, and made him old before his time.\r\n\r\nCamoens was a great man, not only as poet, but in the qualities of his\r\nmind and heart. He entered life full of aspiration after the good and\r\nbeautiful. He loved tenderly and fondly one who was as pure and good as\r\nshe was lovely; and in absence, and through hardship and sorrow, still\r\nhe worshipped her idea and mourned her fate. He was gallant and brave in\r\ndoing, as well as in the harder task of bearing. No mean, no servile, no\r\neven dubious act is recorded of him, during the course of many\r\nmisfortunes, when spirits less high might have bowed before the rich and\r\npowerful. He was naturally cheerful, friendly, and fond of society,\r\nwhich he enlivened and adorned by his wit and genius. Fortune warred\r\nwith him long in vain, but she conquered at last, when poor, and sick,\r\nand friendless, he grew melancholy and despairing. At the commencement\r\nwe compared his fortunes with those of Cervantes; but the career of\r\nCamoens was the most disastrous. Every act of his life had an adverse\r\ntermination. In the early season of youth he loved tenderly and\r\nardently; and this feeling had not injured his fortunes, if his\r\nattachment had not been returned. A modern poet asks, \"What makes it\r\nfatal in this world of ours, to be loved?\" It was the love that Dona\r\nCatarina bore the poet, that awakened the enmity of her powerful\r\nrelations, and cast his whole life into shadow. From the hour he was\r\nbanished for her sake, he succeeded in nothing. He fought for his\r\ncountry in Africa, only to be maimed and deformed for life. He visited\r\nIndia only to encounter the same hardships in a worse climate; he\r\namassed a fortune, and lost it in shipwreck; he trusted to the kind\r\nfeelings of the powerful, and found himself reduced to absolute want.\r\nThe most adverse period of Cervantes' life was his captivity at\r\nAlgiers[158], when he had the spirit of early manhood, the love and\r\nadmiration of his companions, his own conscience, and stirring hopes and\r\nfears to animate him. The happiest portion of Camoens' existence, we are\r\ntold, were the years he spent at Macao, away from every friend, with\r\nhope only to cheer him, and his imagination, while he looked over the\r\nwide distant sea that separated him from the dearest objects of life. In\r\nhis last moments, Cervantes had wife and relation near; and, when dying,\r\nhe said farewell, to joy; farewell to his friends. In Camoens' last hour\r\nhis spirit was broken: want and penury, in their most loathsome guise,\r\nwere his death-bed companions, in a wretched hospital. Southey justly\r\nremarks, however, that he is not to be considered a martyr to\r\nliterature; for he in no way depended on that for bread. He was a martyr\r\nto that political system which created a body of men, (the younger sons\r\nof the nobility), who, if they inherited no property, could acquire a\r\nlivelihood only by court favour; and that is never bestowed upon the\r\nworthiest. He sought advancement, as well as the \"bubble, honour, at the\r\ncannon's mouth.\" He gained the latter only; and unless his spirit now\r\nenjoys the fame which he desired during life, it was a bubble indeed,\r\nwithout substance to support him in his necessity. Had he lived a little\r\nlonger, we are told Philip II. desired to see him when at Lisbon; and he\r\nwould have found assistance in him. Many is the reprieve fate sends to\r\nthe suffering after they are dead, as if to show her power, and to\r\nimpress us with the idea that all depends on her fiat. Wherefore Heaven\r\nhas established a law, that the best men are to suffer most in this\r\nlife, is a mystery. All we know is, that so it is, and so learn at least\r\nto revere those cast in adversity, and to glory rather than feel shame\r\nin the frowns of fortune.[159]\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that men should let a fellow-creature die as Camoens\r\ndied; a man, too, who possessed the much-coveted advantage of birth, who\r\nhad fought for his country, and celebrated her glories in his verse.\r\nLong did these very verses--the \"Lusiad,\" and the reputation it\r\npromised--bear him up; yet some hope he lost as he concluded it, and at\r\nlast he breaks off impatiently,--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No more, my Muse, no more; my harp's ill strung,\r\nHeavy and out of tune, and my voice hoarse--\r\nAnd not with singing, but to see I've sung\r\nTo a deaf people, and without remorse.\r\nFavour that wont t'inspire the poet's tongue,\r\nOur country yields not: she minds the purse\r\nToo much; exhaling from her gilded mud\r\nNothing but dross and melancholy blood.\r\n\r\nNor know I by what fate or duller chance,\r\nMen have not now the life or general gust,\r\nWhich made them with a cheerful countenance,\r\nThemselves into perpetual action thrust.\r\n* * * * *\r\nWhile I, who speak in rude and humble rhyme,\r\nNor known, or dreamt of by my king at all,\r\nKnow yet from mouths of little ones sometime\r\nThe praise of great ones does completely fall\r\nI want not honest studies for my prime,\r\nNor long experience, since to mix withal;\r\nI want not wit, such as in this you see,\r\nThree things which rarely in conjunction be.\"\r\n\r\nAn arm to serve you, trained in war have I,\r\nA soul, to sing you, to the Muses bent;\r\nOnly I want acceptance in your eye,\r\nWho owe to virtue fair encouragement\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt so long on the various and melancholy circumstances of\r\nCamoens' lot, that small space is left to speak of his works. Of his\r\nlesser poems, his lyrics, and sonnets, such mention has been made in the\r\nforegoing pages as have informed the reader of their high merit.\r\nImpassioned yet tender, earnest, yet soft--full of heart, and all the\r\nbetter feelings of the soul, they are the type of Camoens, and deserve\r\nthe same praise as he himself merits.\r\n\r\nPatriotism, warmed by the heroic deeds of the discoverers of the passage\r\nto India, inspired him with the idea of the Lusiad. He named it \"Os\r\nLusitanos,\" that is to say, the Lusitanians or Portuguese. It opens with\r\nthe arrival of Vasco de Gama in the Mozambique; it carries him thence,\r\nafter many dangers, to Calicut, and brings him thence home. Episodical\r\nnarrations vary the poem. It has faults.[160] Its mythology is clumsy.\r\nWhile bringing forward Christians as Moslems in contention, the\r\nintroduction of the heathen deities, of Bacchus and Venus, is\r\nridiculous; yet the description of Venus presenting herself to Jupiter,\r\nin the second canto, may make any lover of the beautiful pardon the\r\nincongruity. The Lusiad is full of beauties: stanzas that rise to\r\nsublimity, touch the heart by their pathos, or charm it by descriptive\r\nbeauties, abound. Above all, there is fire, a heart, a soul--flesh and\r\nblood, enthusiasm, and the poet's best spirit, to adorn it with\r\nmagnanimous sentiments, patriotism, and piety.\r\n\r\nAs such, the Lusiad is an immortal poem, and Camoens a poet that the\r\nworld may be proud to have brought forth. He has been considered such,\r\nand his poem translated into many languages. In English Mickles' is the\r\nmodern and popular one; but it has no pretension to fidelity; and,\r\nthough Mickle was a man of taste and a poet, we turn impatiently from\r\nhis paraphrase to the truer, though uncouth version of Fanshaw.[161]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Experimentou-se alguã hora\r\nDa Ave que chamaõ Camaõ,\r\nQue, se da Casa, onde mora,\r\nVe adultera a Senhora,\r\nMorre de pura paixaõ.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Lord Strangford dates the migration of this family from\r\nthe time of this Ancestor Ruy de Camoens--and speaks of him as a\r\nfollower of king Fernando. Ferreira is his authority, but other\r\ncommentators give a different account See Vida del Poeta por Faria y\r\nSousa, III. IV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Faria y Sousa, in his second life of Camoens appended to\r\nhis \"Rimas,\" mentions having found, in the registers of the Portuguese\r\nIndia House, a list of all the chief persons who sailed to India. In the\r\nlist for 1550, there is this entry: \"Luis de Camoens, son of Simon Vaz\r\nand Ana de Sa,\" inhabitants of Lisbon, in the quarter of la Monraria,\r\nescudeiro (a name equivalent to our esquire), with a red beard; he gave\r\nhis father as surety--and sails in the ship San Pedro los Burgalezes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Lusiad, Canto VII. 78. Further mention will be made\r\nhereafter of this passage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: It is curious to compare the smooth, even, and (so to\r\nspeak) _unindividualized_ verses of Mickle with the rugged and even\r\nuncouth stanza of Fanshaw. Both are unlike Camoens. He wrote with fire,\r\nand each word bore stamp of the man; but his style is elevated and truly\r\npoetic--different from the Pope--like flow of Mickle, and the almost\r\nvulgar idiom that Fanshaw too often adopts. This is the stanza in the\r\noriginal Portuguese:\r\n\r\nFez primeiro em Coimbra exercitarse\r\nO valeroso officio de Minerva;\r\nE de Helicona as Musas fez passar se,\r\nA pizar de Mondego a fertil herva.\r\nQuanto pode de Athenas desejarse\r\nTudo o soberbo Apollo aqui reserva:\r\nAqui as capellas dá tecidas de ouro,\r\nDo baccharo, e do sempre verde louro.\r\n\r\n_Canto_ III. 97.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He was the first that made Coimbra shine\r\nWith liberal sciences, which Pallas taught;\r\nBy him from Helicon the Muses nine,\r\nTo bruise Mondego's grassy brink were brought:\r\nHither transferr'd Apollo that rich mine,\r\nWhich the old Greeks in learned Athens wrought:\r\nThere ivy wreaths with gold he interweaves,\r\nAnd the coy Daphne's never fading leaves.\"\r\n\r\n_Fanshaw's Translation._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: Cancam, VII. See also Cancam, II.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Soneto, VI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: The translation is from Mr. Adamson's pages; it has the\r\nfault of being in longer measure than the original, and therefore losing\r\nsome of its simplicity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: Lord Strangford's translation, p. 94.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Faria y Sousa, says 1542--other commentators give 1545.\r\nThe latter seems the more likely date.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Mr. Adamson says, that \"The sonnet does not allude to any\r\nparticular situation but certainly the line\r\n\r\nEu crendo que o lugar me defendia,\r\n\r\nalludes to its being a church, which, as is well known, is in Catholic\r\ncounties, where young ladies are so much shut up, a usual place for\r\nfalling in love.--Lope de Vega alludes to this circumstance and the\r\nsimilarity between the loves of Petrarch and Camoens--\r\n\r\nEl culto celestial se celebrava\r\nDel mayor Viernes en la Iglesia pia,\r\nQuando por Laura Franco se encendia,\r\ny Liso por Natercia se inflamava.\r\n\r\nLiso and Natercia were the anagrams which Camoens framed of his own and\r\nhis lady's Christian name--his own, Luis, being frequently spelt Lois.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Soneto 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Lord Strangford's translation is not literal, but it\r\nretains all the feeling of the original, and is very beautiful:--\r\n\r\n\"Till lovers' tears at parting cease to flow,\r\nNor sundered hearts by strong despair be torn,\r\nSo long recorded be that April morn\r\nWhen gleams of joy were dashed with showers of woe.\r\nScarce had the purpling east began to glow,\r\nOf mournful men, it saw me most forlorn;\r\nSaw those hard pangs by gentle bosom borne,\r\n(The hardest, sure, that gentle bosoms know!)\r\nBut oh, it saw love's charming secret told\r\nBy tears fast dropping from celestial eyes,\r\nBy sobs of grief, and by such piteous sighs\r\nAs e'en might turn th' infernal caverns cold\r\nAnd make the guilty deem their sufferings ease,\r\nTheir torments luxury--compared to these!\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: These verses are peculiarly beautiful in the original.\r\nThe translation, though flowing, does not embody the ideas of the\r\nPortuguese with exactitude, or with equal energy of expression.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: While Camoens was in Africa his father sailed to India,\r\nand died at Goa on his arrival. Is it not possible that Simon Vaz,\r\ninstead of being in Africa, was in Lisbon, as indeed seems certain, as\r\nhe was surety for his son; and that his projected voyage caused Luis to\r\nentertain the design of going to India also, though hopes of preferment\r\ninduced him rather to wish to sail with the viceroy than on board his\r\nfather's vessel. But the invitation of his youthful friend, the\r\nreluctance he felt to give up every hope of seeing dona Caterina again,\r\nmade him prefer an expedition to Africa. Simon Vaz died on his arrival\r\nat Goa, but voyages in those days were long and uncertain: and when Luis\r\nactually sailed for India, he probably had not heard of his father's\r\nfate, and went out with the intention of joining him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Don Jose Maria de Sousa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: There is a singular story told by Faria y Sousa, that he\r\nfound among the old books on the stall of Pedro Coelho, at Madrid, a MS.\r\ncopy of the first six cantos of the Lusiad, written before Camoens went\r\nto India. The copy at the conclusion contained this note: \"These six\r\ncantos were purloined from Luis de Camoens, from the work which has\r\ncommenced on the discovery and conquest of India by the Portuguese: they\r\nare all finished except the sixth;--the conclusion of that is here\r\ngiven, yet it wants the story of the history of his loves that Leonardo\r\nrelates during his watch, which ought to follow at stanza 46., where the\r\nloss of it is felt, for the conversation of those on watch becomes in\r\nconsequence shorter and duller, and the canto is shorter than the\r\nothers.\" Faria y Sousa adds that he found several stanzas in this MS.\r\nwanting in the printed copies, but as the Lusiad was published under the\r\ninspection of Camoens, it is to be doubted, whether a late commentator\r\n(Sousa) is right in reproaching his predecessor for not preserving the\r\nnew ones, since it would appear that they were expunged by Camoens\r\nhimself.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: The sonnet has been translated by lord Strangford.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: These lines are quoted from the first eclogue of\r\nGarcilaso de la Vega. It is supposed that Camoens meant, that his\r\nenemies were angry to see the reputation they coveted, possessed by him.\r\nThe language and style of this letter is so very obscure as to be almost\r\nuntranslatable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: A place a few miles from Lisbon, where bulls are bred for\r\nthe bull-fights. He seems to use these expressions ironically.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: A discussion has arisen concerning the cause of Camoens'\r\nbanishment. Fario y Sousa, who lived near the time of Camoens, (he was\r\nborn in 1590,) says that Barreto took offence at this second satire, and\r\nadds with great candour and good feeling: \"There is not anything\r\nreprehensible in all my master's actions, except his having written\r\nthese satires, for in doing so he lost sight of prudence, independence,\r\nand the bearing of a cavalier; as not any of these qualities belong to a\r\nsatirist. Barreto, likewise, who was a man possessing a great mind, did\r\nnot appear to advantage in revenging himself so sternly upon a man of\r\nsuch abilities, and in treating him with such rigour.\" The late\r\nbiographer Sousa resents this account. He says, \"the satire was falsely\r\nattributed to Camoens, since no spark of his genius appears,--nor is he\r\nfound either before, or after that time, indulging in that species of\r\ncomposition.\" Southey warmly takes Faria's part, (whom he names one of\r\nthe most upright and high-minded men that ever ended his days in\r\nhonourable poverty) and blames Camoens. Adamson is inclined to side with\r\nSousa. We must remember that Barreto was a cruel, arbitrary, and\r\nextortionate man: and the sense Camoens evinces of his banishment, makes\r\nus willing to believe that he was supported by a lofty sense of\r\ninnocence. He calls his banishment an unjust decree, in the Lusiad,--and\r\nin more energetic language in another poem, he wishes that the\r\nremembrance of his exile might, in punishment of those by whom it was\r\nobtained, be sculptured in rock or adamant.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: The description which he gives of the place where he\r\nspent the greater part of his exile, as doctor Southey justly remarks,\r\napplies decidedly to Macao and not to Ternate, as Mr. Adamson supposes.\r\n\r\nCercada esta de hum rio,\r\nDe maritimas aguas saudosas,\r\nDas herbas que aqui nascem,\r\nOs gados juntamente, y es olhos passeml,\r\nAqui minha ventura\r\nQuiz que huma grande parte,\r\nDa vida----se passasse.\r\n\r\n\"It is surrounded by an ocean-stream of salt water. On the herbage that\r\nit produces the flock and the eye jointly pasture. Here fortune willed\r\nthat a considerable part of my life should be passed.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: That Camoens, banished by Barreto, held a profitable\r\nsituation under him seems a contradiction; yet since he amassed a sum of\r\nmoney that seemed wealth to him, he must have been appointed during the\r\ngovernorship of Barreto. The Quarterly Review, bent on admiring the\r\nvirtues of power, deduces arguments in favour of Barreto: but Camoens\r\ncould not have denounced him as he did had he been under obligations to\r\nhim, obligations too, which the whole world in India would have\r\nconsidered full compensation for his exile from Goa. Sousa considers\r\nthat his stay was of longer duration at Ternate than we assign, and that\r\nhe did not fill the place at Macao till a later period, when it was\r\ngiven him by Barreto's successor. But then he would not have had time to\r\namass a fortune. Here therefore is an enigma, whose solution we cannot\r\ndiscover, unless it be (and it seems the probable conjecture) that the\r\nlocal governor of Macao preferred Camoens to this place, and Barreto had\r\nnothing at all to do with it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: To this wreck, and to his escape he refers in the\r\nprophetic song in the tenth Lusiad when he speaks of the river Mecon--\r\n\r\n\"Upon his soft and charitable brim\r\nThe wet and shipwrecked song receive shall he,\r\nWhich in a lamentable plight shall swim\r\nFrom shoals and quicksands of tempestuous sea,\r\nThe dire effect of exile,--when on _him_\r\nIs executed the unjust decree,\r\nWhose repercussive lyre shall have the fate\r\nTo be renowned more than fortunate.\"\r\n\r\n_Lusiad_, canto X. stanza 128.--_Fanshaw's Translation._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: We cannot help preferring the faithful and nervous,\r\nthough uncouth and even obsolete, translation of Fanshaw to the more\r\ndiluted stream of Mickle's heroics. Southey speaks of \"the elaborate and\r\ncurious infidelity of Mickle's version;\" at the same time that he\r\npraises it highly. Desirous of understanding the soul of Camoens, it is\r\nnot from his smooth expressions, that the reader unacquainted with\r\nPortuguese can be informed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: Don Joze Faria y Souza, the latest Portuguese\r\ncommentator, first suggested this as the probable epoch of dona\r\nCatarina's death, in contradistinction to all other biographers, who\r\nplace it on his return from Ceuta. He founds his notion on the internal\r\nevidence of Camoens' lyrics and sonnets, and has made converts of\r\nAdamson and Southey, and will of all future biographers. There is this\r\nof agreeable also; that Camoens is rescued from the charge, that\r\notherwise lies at his door (and is mentioned by Lord Strangford), of\r\nforgetting dona Catarina as soon as she was no more, and addressing\r\nanother lady in the language of constant love. But these poems show by\r\ntheir context that they were addressed to his first love, who still\r\nlived.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: Perpetuo saudade da alma mia.\r\n\r\nThe word _saudade_ is peculiar to the Portuguese language--it includes\r\nmuch--a recollection accompanied by affection, and regret, and pleasure:\r\nfriends when they write, send saudades instead of our remembrances to\r\nothers, and it speaks of more tender and kind feeling.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: One of the most perfect and beautiful of Camoens' poems,\r\nis a sonnet which many have preferred to the one of Petrarch on the same\r\nsubject, or even to his Trionfa, which also narrates the visionary visit\r\nof his lost love. The following is Mr. Hayley's translation:--\r\n\r\n\"While prest with woes from which it cannot flee,\r\nMy fancy sinks, and slumber seals my eyes,\r\nHer spirit hastens in my dreams to rise,\r\nWho was in life but as a dream to me.\r\nO'er the drear waste, so wide no eye can see\r\nHow far its sense-evading limit lies,\r\nI follow her quick step; but ah, she flies!\r\nOur distance wid'ning by fate's stern decree.\r\n'Fly not from me, kind shadow,' I exclaim;\r\nShe with fixed eyes, that her soft thoughts reveal,\r\nAnd seemed to say, 'Forbear thy fond design,'--\r\nStill flies.--I call her, but her half-formed name\r\nDies on my falt'ring tongue.--I wake and feel\r\nNot e'en one short delusion can be mine.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: Southey has given the following account of his\r\nrival:--\"Diego Bernardes, one of the best of the Portuguese poets, was\r\nborn on the banks of the Lima, and passionately fond of its scenery.\r\nSome of his poems will bear comparison with the best poems of their\r\nkind. There is a charge of plagiarism against him, for having printed\r\nseveral of Camoen's sonnets as his own: to obtain any proof on this\r\nsubject would be very difficult: this, however, is certain, that his own\r\nundisputed productions resemble them so much in affecting tenderness and\r\nsweetness of diction, that the whole appear like the works of one\r\nauthor.\"--_Notes to Southey's Don Roderick._ Bernardes, however, had no\r\nreason to congratulate himself on the choice having fallen on him. He\r\nwas taken prisoner in the battle in which Sebastian fell; and then he\r\nblamed the unfortunate king, and deplored his own fate--a captive doomed\r\nto labour and chains. He obtained his liberty, and died at Lisbon in\r\n1596, and was buried in the same church a Camoens.

Macedo\r\nwas an acute critic: as such, he could more readily detect defects than\r\nbeauties. He saw with discerning eye the faults of plan in the\r\nLusiad;--but he was not warmed by its fire, nor elevated by its genius.\r\nThe most entire vengeance a friend of Camoens could take, he himself\r\nachieved when he wrote his poem, whose machinery and plan are no better,\r\nand which possesses none of the transcendant merits of its predecessor.\r\nTo subvert a national idol, is an invidious task--to set himself upon\r\nthe same pedestal, a ridiculous pretension.
