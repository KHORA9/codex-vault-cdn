It included the essential features of THE ESTIMATE OF THE\r\nSITUATION which, since 1910, had been issued at intervals in a series\r\nof revised editions. The new material that was added in 1936 was\r\nintended to assist in enlarging the viewpoint and in broadening the\r\nbasis of professional judgment.\r\n\r\nPrimarily intended for the purposes of the Naval War College, this\r\nwork is the cumulative result of years of untiring and loyal effort on\r\nthe part of the College staff and student body. Equally important have\r\nbeen the advice and assistance contributed by other officers of wide\r\nprofessional experience and attainment.\r\n\r\nThe objective has been a brief but inclusive treatment of the\r\nfundamentals of the military profession, i.e., the profession of arms.\r\nThe emphasis, naturally, is on the exercise of mental effort in the\r\nsolution of military problems, more especially in our Navy. An\r\nenormous literature has been consulted, and research has included all\r\navailable and pertinent military writings. Care has also been taken to\r\ninclude, from civil sources, the findings of those authoritative works\r\nwhich deal with related matters and with the applicable underlying\r\ntruths.\r\n\r\nIn a work of this type and scope, it is manifestly not possible to\r\nillustrate the abstract text by historical examples and analogies.\r\nThese are complementary features of the War College resident and\r\ncorrespondence courses; provision for the necessary historical\r\nbackground is otherwise the concern of the individual student.\r\n\r\nIn this edition of SOUND MILITARY DECISION no radical changes have\r\nbeen made; the revision has been confined to rearrangement and\r\namplification of the subject matter.\r\n\r\n                                               E.C.

The\r\nresult has been the accumulation of a mass of information from which\r\nconclusions have been drawn as to the causes of success and failure.\r\nAlthough scattered through countless volumes, and nowhere completely\r\nsystematized and classified, this accepted body of knowledge\r\nconstitutes the basis for the science of war.\r\n\r\nScientific investigation--that is, the collection, verification, and\r\nclassification of facts--follows the recurrent procedure of successive\r\nanalysis, hypothesis, theory, and test. The application of this\r\nprocess to the campaigns of history reveals fundamentals common to\r\nall, irrespective of whether the sphere of action has been land, sea,\r\nor air. In the ceaseless struggle for supremacy between the offense\r\nand the defense, great technological changes have taken place. The\r\nsuccessful conduct of war, however, has always depended on effective\r\noperations for the creation or maintenance of favorable military\r\nsituations, whose essential elements have remained unchanged\r\nthroughout the years (see page 46).\r\n\r\nThese fundamental considerations (see page 28), whatever the detailed\r\nform of their presentation, are the basis for the successful conduct\r\nof war. The need of such a basis has been felt from very early times.\r\nIt was not, however, until the early part of the Nineteenth Century\r\nthat students of warfare appear to have recorded the view that the\r\nconduct of war is susceptible of reduction to scientific analysis, and\r\nthat only through a reasoned theory can the true causes of success and\r\nfailure be explained.\r\n\r\nSuch a scientific analysis of any subject has for its chief practical\r\naim the improvement of the art, or practice, of that subject. Forming\r\nan important part of the science of war are those new developments in\r\nweapons and in other technological fields which, with the passage of\r\ntime, have brought about great changes in methods of waging war. It is\r\nonly through founding the art of war--the application of the science\r\nof war to actual military situations--on the fundamental truths\r\ndiscovered through the science of war, that changes in method, due to\r\ntechnological evolution, can be made most effective.\r\n\r\nIn preparing for war, the only practicable peacetime tests are usually\r\nrestricted to those afforded by examples of the past, by problems such\r\nas chart (map) and board maneuvers, and by fleet and field exercises.\r\nWhile the military profession can afford to neglect none of them,\r\nsuch tests can never be conclusive. This fact, however, far from\r\njustifying resort to any other procedure, emphasizes the necessity for\r\nutilization of the scientific method in order to arrive at conclusions\r\nwhich are as exact as possible.\r\n\r\nAn exact result is, of course, the aim of all scientific research, but\r\nexactitude necessarily depends on the establishment of correct\r\nrelationships among facts which have so far come to light.\r\nConsequently, there is great variation in the degree of accuracy which\r\nactually characterizes the several sciences. If it be maintained that\r\nonly those studies which have resulted in exact conclusions may\r\nproperly be regarded as sciences, then it can hardly be said that many\r\nsciences, now regarded as such, exist; for the findings of medicine,\r\nbiology, chemistry, and even physics are continually being revised in\r\nthe light of new data.\r\n\r\nThe science of war necessarily includes knowledge gained in other\r\nfields. In war, as in medicine or any other practical activity, the\r\nmore inclusive and dependable the body of knowledge available as a\r\nbasis for action, the more probable it is that the application of this\r\nknowledge, the art (page 1), will be effective.\r\n\r\nRealization of these facts has led to renewed emphasis on the\r\nscientific approach to the solution of military problems. The fallacy\r\nof staking the future upon the possible availability of a military\r\ngenius in time of need became clear when it was appreciated that more\r\nthan one nation, hitherto victorious in arms, had been defeated and\r\nhumiliated when genius no longer led its forces.\r\n\r\nThere followed in the military profession a conviction that, although\r\nextraordinary inherent capacity can be recognized and utilized when\r\nknown to exist, it is safer and wiser to develop by training the\r\nhighest average of ability in leadership than to trust to untrained\r\n\"common sense\" or to the possible advent of a genius. History has\r\nabundantly proved the folly of attempting, on any other basis, to cope\r\nwith the unpredictable occurrence of genius in the hostile leadership.\r\nWith the actual exercise of leadership in war restricted to the\r\nreality of war, there is emphasized the need of peacetime\r\ntraining--training of subordinates in efficient performance, and, more\r\nimportant, training of those who will be placed by the State in\r\npositions of responsibility and command.\r\n\r\nCampaigns of the Twentieth Century reflect the intensity of mental\r\ntraining among the armed forces of the greater powers; the planning\r\nand conduct of war have acquired a precision, a swiftness, and a\r\nthoroughness before unknown. The study and analysis of past campaigns,\r\nthe sifting of technical details from fundamental truths, and the\r\nshrewd combination of the theoretical and the practical form the basis\r\nof this training.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution of military problems requires the reaching of\r\nsound decision as to what is to be done. Upon the soundness of the\r\ndecision depends, in great part, the effectiveness of the resulting\r\naction. Both are dependent on the possession of a high order of\r\nprofessional judgment, fortified by knowledge and founded on\r\nexperience. Theoretical knowledge supplements experience, and is the\r\nbest substitute in its absence. Judgment, the ability to understand\r\nthe correct relationship between cause and effect, and to apply that\r\nknowledge under varying circumstances, is essential to good\r\nleadership. Professional judgment is inherently strengthened by mental\r\nexercise in the application of logical processes to the solution of\r\nmilitary problems.\r\n\r\nThe approach, presented herein, to the solution of military problems\r\nis intended to assist the military profession in reaching sound\r\ndecisions as to (1) the selection of its correct objectives, the ends\r\ntoward which its action is to be directed under varying circumstances;\r\n(2) planning the detailed operations required; (3) transmitting the\r\nintent so clearly as to ensure inauguration of well-coordinated\r\naction; and (4) the effective supervision of such action.\r\n\r\nThe student of war will find in these pages a fundamental military\r\nphilosophy whose roots go down to very ancient times. In the technique\r\ndescribed for the solution of military problems, experienced officers\r\nwill recognize a system with which they are already familiar. This\r\nsystem, constantly under study to improve its details, has been in use\r\nin our military Services for many years.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of this philosophy and of the system for its practical\r\nutilization rests on the concept of relative or proportional values.\r\nIn the military environment, change, rather than stability, is\r\nespecially to be expected, and the relationships existing among the\r\nessential elements of a military situation are, in fact, the\r\nsignificant values. Such values, themselves, vary with the viewpoint\r\nof the person concerned. Accordingly, because of the difference in\r\nobjectives (defined above), what is strategy as viewed by a commander\r\non a higher echelon may have more of a tactical aspect to those on a\r\nlower (page 10). Immediate objectives and ultimate objectives (page\r\n54) can scarcely be understood in their true proportions unless the\r\npoint of reference is clear. The point of view of the commander, as\r\nestablished by the position he occupies in the chain of command, is,\r\ntherefore, to be taken into consideration in every phase of the\r\nsolution of a problem,--in the determination of the appropriate effect\r\ndesired (page 43), of relative fighting strength (page 35), and of\r\ncourses of action and the detailed operations pertaining thereto (page\r\n88).\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these facts, instantaneous and easy understanding of\r\nall the elements involved is not to be expected. Were such\r\nunderstanding possible, the expert conduct of war would be one of the\r\neasiest, instead of one of the most difficult, of human activities. It\r\nis only through a gradual assimilation of its fundamentals that the\r\nprofession of arms is to be mastered. A process of true education is\r\ninvolved,--that of enlarging the viewpoint and broadening the basis of\r\nprofessional judgment (see page i),--and its essentials are the proper\r\nfoundation for any system of self-improvement in the exercise of\r\nmental power. There is no easy road to the goal of military effort.\r\n\r\nPart I, hereafter, discusses professional judgment in its basic\r\nrelation to the successful conduct of war. This treatment examines the\r\nresponsibilities of the armed forces, discusses the role of the\r\ncommander, indicates the natural mental processes employed in the\r\nsolution of military problems, formulates and explains the Fundamental\r\nMilitary Principle, and concludes with an outline of the procedure for\r\nits further application in Parts II and III.\r\n\r\nPart II is concerned with the solution of the problems encountered\r\nduring the planning stage.\r\n\r\nPart III discusses the execution of the plan,--the directives and the\r\nsupervision of the action,--but the treatment as to details is chiefly\r\nfrom the standpoint of the mental effort. During hostilities the vital\r\nissues which hinge on alert supervision create an accentuated demand\r\nfor the intelligent exercise of professional judgment. Its possession\r\nto a highly developed degree and its exercise on a foundation of\r\nknowledge and experience, are prerequisite to attainment of the\r\nhighest standards in the conduct of war.\r\n\r\nThe following pages are intended, therefore, to provide a fundamental\r\nbasis upon which the commander, by thoughtful study and reflection,\r\nmay develop his professional judgment to the end that its exercise\r\nresult in sound military decision, essential alike to wise planning\r\nand to consistently effective action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN ITS RELATION TO\r\nTHE SUCCESSFUL CONDUCT OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nCOMMAND AND ITS PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n    The Foreword, preceding, has explained the scientific\r\n    approach to the solution of military problems. It has been\r\n    brought to notice that the science of war can be utilized to\r\n    further sound military decision and, so, to improve the\r\n    practice of war, i.e., the art of war, whether under assumed\r\n    or actual conditions. The Foreword has also stressed the\r\n    importance of education for the development of judgment in\r\n    the application of mental power to the solution of military\r\n    problems.\r\n\r\n    Chapter I, which now follows, deals with the armed forces in\r\n    their relation to national policy, and discusses,\r\n    specifically, the role of the commander with respect to the\r\n    use of mental power as a recognized component of fighting\r\n    strength. Emphasis is placed on the important subjects of\r\n    military strategy and tactics, unity of effort, the chain of\r\n    command, authority and responsibility, organization, mutual\r\n    understanding, loyalty, and indoctrination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Implementation of National Policy. Organized government exists for\r\nthe purpose of bringing into systematic union the individuals of a\r\nState for the attainment of common ends. The primary national\r\nobjective (page 3) is the ensurance of envisaged prosperity and of\r\nessential security for the social system which is the fundamental\r\nbasis of the community. Whatever the form of government, the power and\r\nauthority of the State are vested in an individual, or in a grouping\r\nof individuals, whose voice is the voice of the State. In the\r\nprosecution of the chief aim of organized government, the State\r\ncrystallizes the many conflicting desires and views of its people into\r\npolicies, internal and external. Each policy is a method of procedure\r\nfor attaining one or more national objectives.\r\n\r\nInternal policies are rendered effective by enforcement of the laws of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nExternal policies, to become effective, require recognition by other\r\nStates, tacitly or by agreement. When there is conflict between the\r\npolicies of one State and those of another, peaceful means of\r\nsettlement are usually sought.\r\n\r\nIf peaceful (diplomatic) means fail to settle the point at issue, the\r\nState abandons the policy in question, defers action to enforce it, or\r\nadopts stronger measures. Such measures may take the form of\r\npsychological, political, or economic pressure. They may even include\r\nthe threat to employ armed force before actually resorting to the\r\nimposition of physical violence. During actual hostilities, also,\r\nevery means of pressure known to man, in addition to physical\r\nviolence, may be employed.\r\n\r\nWhether the use of armed force to impose or to resist the imposition\r\nof policy constitutes a legal state of war is a political question\r\nwhich does not affect the tasks the armed forces may be called on to\r\nperform. War, therefore, is to be understood herein as any condition\r\nin which one State employs physical violence against another, or\r\nagainst an organized part of itself which may be in rebellion.\r\n\r\nBy agreement among nations, effort has been made to discountenance\r\naggressive warfare. The distinction between aggression and\r\nself-defense is, however, not a matter of agreement. War is still\r\nemployed as an instrument of national policy. No nation has, as yet,\r\nmanifested willingness to relinquish the right to employ armed force\r\nin resisting aggression, nor the right to decide what constitutes\r\nself-defense. States still maintain and employ armed forces as a means\r\nof promoting and expanding, as well as of defending, their welfare and\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe Primary Function of the Armed Forces. Whether war is an ethical\r\ninstitution is not a matter within the purview of the armed forces.\r\nTheir primary function is, when called upon to do so, to support and,\r\nwithin the sphere of military effort, to enforce the policy of the\r\nState. The performance of this function constitutes the chief reason\r\nfor their existence.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental objective of the armed forces is, therefore, the\r\nreduction of the opposing will to resist. It is attained through the\r\nuse of actual physical violence or the threat thereof (page 7). This\r\nfact constitutes the underlying motive of every military plan, whether\r\nfor the conduct of a minor or contributory operation, or for the\r\nprosecution of a major campaign. The final outcome is dependent on\r\nability to isolate, occupy, or otherwise control the territory of the\r\nenemy, for land is the natural habitat of man (page 46). Since\r\nopposition is to be expected, the military problem is primarily\r\nconcerned with the application of power--mental, moral, and\r\nphysical--in overcoming resistance, or in exerting effort to resist.\r\n\r\nThe application of power implies effort, i.e., the exertion of\r\nstrength. The mental, moral, and physical power at the disposal of the\r\narmed forces depends on the effort which can be exerted by the human\r\nand material components of their fighting strength.\r\n\r\nThe skillful employment of fighting strength, as a weapon more\r\neffective than the enemy's under a given set of circumstances, is the\r\ngoal toward which the armed forces direct their effort. The elements\r\nof the material component--arms, ammunition, and other equipment--are\r\nindispensable. They are impotent, however, without the direction and\r\nenergy supplied by the human component, its moral and mental elements\r\nnicely balanced and judiciously compounded with physical fitness. A\r\ntrue concept of the art of war will insist that the necessity for the\r\nachievement of a high standard of technical and administrative skill\r\nnot be permitted to outweigh the need for maximum development of other\r\nmental attainments, and of the moral components of fighting strength.\r\n\r\nThe moral elements include all the essential attributes of personal\r\ncharacter, and more especially those qualities of courage, loyalty,\r\ndecisiveness, modesty, patience, tolerance of the opinions of others,\r\nand fearlessness of responsibility which are characteristics of true\r\nmilitary leadership. The maintenance of a high ethical standard is\r\nessential to the establishment and continuance of mutual confidence.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications essential to the proper application of the mental\r\nelements include a creative imagination and the ability to think and\r\nto reason logically, fortified by practical experience and by a\r\nknowledge of the science of war. An unmistakable mark of mental\r\nmaturity is the ability to distinguish between preconceived ideas and\r\nfundamental knowledge. Intellectual honesty, unimpaired by the\r\ninfluence of tradition, prejudice, or emotion, is the essential basis\r\nfor the effective employment of mental power.\r\n\r\nThe numerical size of the armed forces, in their correct perspective\r\nas an instrument of the State, as well as the extent to which they are\r\nsupplied with material components of fighting strength, are matters to\r\nbe determined by the State after consultation with the responsible\r\nmilitary authorities. The development of the essential military\r\nqualities of the instrument is the special charge of the armed forces.\r\nIt is their task to weld the assemblage of men, armed and maintained\r\nby the State, into an harmonious whole, skilled in technique and\r\nimbued with a psychological and mental attitude which will not admit\r\nthat any obstacle is insuperable.\r\n\r\nThe Advisory Function. Understanding between the civil representatives\r\nof the State and the leaders of the armed forces is manifestly\r\nessential to the coordination of national policy with the power to\r\nenforce it. Therefore, if serious omissions and the adoption of\r\nill-advised measures are to be avoided, it is necessary that wise\r\nprofessional counsel be available to the State. While military\r\nstrategy may determine whether the aims of policy are possible of\r\nattainment, policy may, beforehand, determine largely the success or\r\nfailure of military strategy. It behooves policy to ensure not only\r\nthat military strategy pursue appropriate aims, but that the work of\r\nstrategy be allotted adequate means, and be undertaken under the most\r\nfavorable conditions.\r\n\r\nThese considerations require that the military profession be\r\nqualified, through the possession of mental power, clear vision, and\r\ncapacity for expression, to advise the State in military matters.\r\nThere is thus accentuated the need for mental training, as set forth\r\npreviously in the Foreword.\r\n\r\nMilitary Strategy and Tactics. Military strategy as distinguished by\r\nobjectives (page 3) representing a larger, further, or more\r\nfundamental goal, is differentiated from tactics in that the latter is\r\nconcerned with a more immediate or local aim, which should in turn\r\npermit strategy to accomplish its further objective.\r\n\r\nConsequently, every military situation has both strategical and\r\ntactical aspects. The nature of the objectives to be attained at a\r\nparticular time, and the action to be taken to that end, may be\r\ngoverned chiefly by strategical, or chiefly by tactical,\r\nconsiderations. Whether an operation is distinctively strategical or\r\ntactical will depend, from the standpoint of the commander concerned,\r\non the end which he has in view.\r\n\r\nTo attain its objective, strategy uses force (or threatens such use)\r\n(see page 8) as applied by tactics; tactics employed for a purpose\r\nother than that of contributing to the aims of strategy is unsound.\r\nProper tactics, therefore, has a strategic background. Definition of\r\ntactics as the art of handling troops or ships in battle, or in the\r\nimmediate presence of the enemy, is not all-inclusive. Such a view\r\ninfers that the field of battle is the only province of tactics, or\r\nthat strategy abdicates when tactics comes to the fore.\r\n\r\nActually, while tactical considerations may predominate during battle,\r\ntheir influence is not confined to the immediate presence of the\r\nenemy. Tactical dispositions are frequently adopted for convenience,\r\nfor time saving, or for other reasons, long before entry into the\r\nimmediate presence of the enemy. Nor do strategical considerations end\r\nwhen battle is joined. Tactics, unguided by strategy, might blindly\r\nmake sacrifices merely to remain victor on a field of struggle. But\r\nstrategy looks beyond, in order to make the gains of tactics accord\r\nwith the strategic aim. Strategy and tactics are inseparable.\r\n\r\nIt is thus the duty of tactics to ensure that its results are\r\nappropriate to the strategic aim, and the duty of strategy to place at\r\nthe disposal of tactics the power appropriate to the results demanded.\r\nThe latter consideration imposes upon strategy the requirement that\r\nthe prescribed aim be possible of attainment with the power that can\r\nbe made available.\r\n\r\nConsequently, while the attainment of the aims of strategy, generally\r\ndepends upon the results gained by tactics, strategy is initially\r\nresponsible for the success of tactics. It is therefore in the\r\nprovince of strategy to ensure that the attainment of tactical\r\nobjectives furthers, exclusively, the aims of strategy, and also that\r\nthe tactical struggle be initiated under conditions favorable for the\r\nattainment of the designated objectives.\r\n\r\nCommand of the Armed Forces. The initial requisite to the effective\r\nuse of the armed forces is an agency authorized to direct them.\r\n\r\nCommand directs the armed forces. It is vitalized and personified in\r\nthe commander, the human directing head, both of the whole and of\r\norganized groupings in descending scale of importance. Its\r\nresponsibility, during peace, is the perfection of the armed forces to\r\nthe point of readiness for war and, during the conflict, their\r\neffective employment.\r\n\r\nTraining for command, to be effective, is necessarily dependent upon\r\nan understanding of the position occupied by the commander, and of the\r\nrole which he plays. Accordingly, this understanding is an essential\r\nin the study of that aspect of command training which has as its\r\npurpose the development of ability to reach sound decision.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of military command combines the best of human qualities\r\nwith sound knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of the armed\r\nforces. It recognizes in war a form of human activity whose conduct,\r\nlike that of all other human activities, is subject to natural law. It\r\napplies to the mastery of the problems of war, therefore, the natural\r\nmental processes of human thought (see Chapter II); it adapts these\r\nnatural processes to a specific purpose, and consciously develops\r\ntheir use to the maximum degree for the attainment of this end. As\r\ncommand ascends the scale, its viewpoint broadens. Experience and\r\nadded knowledge, with increasing authority and responsibility, lead to\r\na concept of war more and more comprehensive, with the resultant\r\ngrowth in ability to evolve and put into effect a general plan for\r\nthe effective control of collective effort.\r\n\r\nUnity of Effort. An objective is best attained by effective\r\napplication of properly directed effort, exerted by a single\r\nindividual or by groups of individuals. Where individuals are\r\ncollectively concerned, unity of effort is the most important single\r\nfactor contributory to the common success. The basic condition to be\r\nsought by the armed forces is an harmonious whole, capable of putting\r\nforth combined effort, intensified in strength because of the\r\ncollective feature, and rendered effective by its unity.\r\n\r\nThe Chain of Command. Within the limits of human capacity, an\r\norganization can exert its combined effort with greater effect the\r\nmore closely the exercise of command represents the act of a single\r\ncompetent commander. To divide the supreme command in any locality, or\r\nto vest it in a body rather than in an individual, is necessarily to\r\ndiffuse responsibility. In that degree there is then incurred the\r\ndanger, through confusion of wills and ideas, of delaying decision and\r\nof creating corresponding diffusion of effort.\r\n\r\nRealization of this danger has led the military profession to entrust\r\ncommand, subject to justifiable exceptions (see page 71), to a single\r\nhead, while ensuring, by careful selection and training of personnel,\r\nthat competent individuals are available for this duty. Although this\r\nmethod is in seeming conflict with the restriction imposed by\r\nrecognized limitations of human capacity, the difficulty is\r\neffectively met through the chain of command, whereby responsibility\r\nis assigned and authority is transmitted without lessening of ultimate\r\nresponsibility. Responsibility and authority, the latter properly\r\napportioned to the former, are inseparably inherent in command, and\r\nmay not justifiably be severed from one another.\r\n\r\nIn the abstract, the chain of command consists of a series of links,\r\nthrough which responsibility and authority are transmitted. The\r\nsupreme commander is thus linked with his successively subordinate\r\ncommanders, and all are disposed on, so to speak, a vertical series of\r\nlevels, each constituting an echelon of command.\r\n\r\nBy means of the chain of command, a commander is enabled to require of\r\nhis immediate subordinates an expenditure of effort which, in the\r\naggregate, will ensure the attainment of his own objective (page 3).\r\nHe thus assigns tasks to his immediate subordinates, whom he holds\r\ndirectly responsible for their execution without, however, divesting\r\nhimself of any part of his initial responsibility. The accomplishment\r\nof each of these assigned tasks will involve the attainment of an\r\nobjective, necessarily less in scope than that of the immediate\r\nsuperior but a contribution to the attainment of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe character and magnitude of the objective of the highest echelon\r\ninvolved will have considerable bearing upon the number of echelons\r\nrequired for its attainment. Whatever the number, a commander on a\r\nparticular echelon occupies the position of an immediate subordinate\r\nto a commander on the next higher echelon, and that of an immediate\r\nsuperior with relation to a commander on the next lower echelon.\r\nWithin these confines, authority is exercised and accomplishment\r\nexacted, both to the extent calculated to ensure unity of effort.\r\n\r\nThere may frequently be found two or more commanders occupying\r\ncoordinate positions on the same echelon, all with the same immediate\r\nsuperior, and all charged with loyalty to him and to each other in the\r\nattainment of a common objective. In no case, however, will a\r\ncommander be directly answerable to more than one immediate superior\r\nfor the performance of the same duty. Thus is fulfilled the\r\nrequirement that the command, although relatively narrower in scope as\r\nthe scale is descended, be reposed in a single head.\r\n\r\nThe experience gained and the knowledge acquired during early service\r\non the lower echelons provide a basis for later expansion of\r\nviewpoint, a better understanding of the position occupied by the\r\nsubordinate and of the obligations of higher command, including its\r\ndependence on subordinates. As the echelons of command are ascended,\r\nthe details involved become more and more numerous, because of the\r\nincreased scope of the problems. On the higher echelons, therefore,\r\nstaff assistance is provided so that the commander may be left free to\r\nconsider matters in their major aspects. The staff of a commander is\r\nnot, however, a part of the chain of command; its members, as such,\r\nexercise no independent authority.\r\n\r\nA chain of command is not created by the subdivision of the officer\r\ncorps into grades on a basis of relative rank. Such subdivision is for\r\nthe purpose of classification from the standpoint of potential\r\ncompetency and capacity for responsibility, and carries no authority\r\nto command by virtue of rank alone. Organization, systematized\r\nconnection for a specific purpose, is first necessary.\r\n\r\nThe armed forces, during peace, are usually subdivided into permanent\r\nmajor organizations for the purpose of attaining and maintaining\r\nreadiness for action. From the several grades of the officer corps, a\r\npermanent chain of command is instituted by the process of organization,\r\nthe supreme command being reposed in a commander-in-chief. The basis of\r\nthe permanent organization is that chosen as best suited to attain and\r\nmaintain readiness. Its choice requires consideration of many factors,\r\nsuch as the types of weapons and vessels, their intended uses, and their\r\ncapabilities, severally and in combination. Further specific demands are\r\nmet by temporary arrangements effected through \"task organization\".\r\nWhether the organization be permanent or temporary, its establishment\r\nplaces in effect a chain of command applicable to that organization\r\nthroughout its continuance.\r\n\r\nHabitual and studied adherence to the chain of command in\r\nadministrative matters, in consultation, in the exchange of\r\ninformation, and in the issue of directives is essential to mutual\r\nunderstanding, and therefore to unity of effort. The right of a\r\ncommander, however, because of the responsibility he shoulders, to\r\ndeal directly with subordinates more than one echelon removed is not\r\nrelinquished because of the existence of the chain of command.\r\nCircumstances may arise which require him to issue orders directly to\r\nany person under his command. Fully aware, however, of the value of\r\nunity of effort, and recognizing that failure to deal through his\r\nimmediate subordinate, no matter what the exigency, cannot but tend to\r\nweaken the chain of command, he will, as soon as the state of the\r\nemergency permits, inform intervening commanders of the action he has\r\nbeen compelled to take.\r\n\r\nMutual Understanding. The chain of command, though providing the\r\nnecessary linkage, does not of itself ensure that the command\r\norganization will be adequate, nor can it ensure that unity of effort\r\nwill result. To meet the requirement of adequacy, there is needed in\r\nthe person of each commander not only the ability to arrive at sound\r\nmilitary decision, to plan, and to direct the operations of his\r\ncommand, but also an appreciation of the position which he occupies in\r\nhis relationship to his immediate superior, on the one hand, and to\r\nhis own immediate subordinates on the other. To meet the requirement\r\nof unity of effort, it is also essential that there exist a state of\r\nmutual understanding throughout the chain of command.\r\n\r\nLoyalty is not merely a moral virtue; it is a great military\r\nnecessity. To establish and to cultivate a state of mutual\r\nunderstanding from which will flow mutual loyalty born of mutual\r\nconfidence (page 9) are prime obligations of command. Within the\r\nlimits of responsibility and resultant authority, individual\r\ninitiative will follow. On a foundation of intelligent cooperation and\r\nresolute determination, the acts of the lowest commander will be in\r\naccordance with the desires of the highest. This, in effect, will\r\nconstitute unity of effort, accomplished through the vesting of\r\ncommand in a single head.\r\n\r\nThe final aim of mutual understanding is attained when, in the absence\r\nof specific instructions, each subordinate commander in the chain acts\r\ninstinctively as his immediate superior, if present, would have him\r\nact, and also cooperates intelligently with commanders occupying\r\ncoordinate positions on the same echelon. For this reason there is\r\nneed, on all echelons, of a complete grasp of the significance of the\r\nrelationship between immediate superior and immediate subordinate, and\r\nof the obligations of each to the other.\r\n\r\nThe proper relationship is such that a subordinate, even though\r\nseparated from his commander, can confidently take action as if the\r\nlatter were present. To this end, the competent commander will earlier\r\nhave cultivated the personal relationship between his immediate\r\nsuperior and himself, and between himself and his subordinates. It is\r\nthrough such close relationship that mutual understanding is best\r\ndeveloped and harmony promoted, so that intelligent and cordial unity\r\nof effort may exist among the personnel of a command.\r\n\r\nThe commander, however competent, necessarily relies on his\r\nsubordinates. Recognizing the psychological factors involved, he will\r\ntherefore manifest confidence in their abilities, display sympathetic\r\ninterest in their efforts, and evince pride in their achievements. He\r\nwill also exercise patience with the mistakes which will inevitably\r\noccur, without condonement, however, of disaffection, neglect, or\r\ncarelessness. The commander may reasonably expect, by the same token,\r\nthat this attitude will characterize his immediate superior.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of his superior, and faced with a changing situation, a\r\ncommander may be forced to the conclusion that his assigned task\r\nrequires modification or alteration. Conditions permitting, he will of\r\ncourse communicate with proper authority, and will make constructive\r\nrepresentations. If he is without adequate communications facilities,\r\nor if circumstances have imposed restrictions on communications\r\nfacilities otherwise available, he takes action according to the\r\ndictates of his own judgment, guided by the known views of his\r\nsuperior. On occasions when he believes that the immediate situation\r\nso requires, he may even depart from his instructions. He realizes\r\nthat in so doing he accepts the gravest of military responsibilities.\r\nAt the same time, however, he recognizes that to fail to take the\r\nindicated action may disclose a lack of the higher qualities of\r\ncourage, judgment, initiative, and loyalty (page 9). He will, of\r\ncourse inform his superior of his action at the first available\r\nopportunity. In the meantime, he has been enabled to act intelligently\r\nand fearlessly because of the existence of a state of mutual\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nIndoctrination. Both the necessary process and the final result of\r\nestablishing a state of mutual understanding are sometimes known as\r\nindoctrination.\r\n\r\nThe word carries the dual meaning of \"the act of indoctrinating\" and\r\n\"the state of being indoctrinated\". In common with the word doctrine,\r\nit has its root in the Latin verb which means \"to teach\". A doctrine,\r\nin its pure meaning, is that which is taught, or set forth for\r\nacceptance or belief.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that every doctrine is necessarily sound, nor that\r\nit is founded on conviction reached as the result of intelligent\r\nthought. Nor is the encouragement of a belief, by means of the spread\r\nof a doctrine, necessarily inspired by good motives. The preaching of\r\ndoctrine known to be false is frequently encountered in many human\r\nactivities. The deliberate spread of false propaganda is an example.\r\nBut, whatever the motive and whether the doctrine be sound or false,\r\nthe act of indoctrination is intended to shape opinion and thus\r\ninfluence action.\r\n\r\nManifestly, to be along permanently useful lines, indoctrination flows\r\nfrom sound philosophy, i.e., is rooted in truth. All teachings, all\r\nopinions that may be advanced, all expressions of viewpoint, i.e., all\r\ndoctrine, is therefore to be scrutinized, first from the standpoint of\r\nvalidity, and then from that of usefulness of application. It is the\r\nresponsibility of command to ensure that these conditions are met\r\nbefore doctrine is pronounced.\r\n\r\nMilitary doctrine, in its broad sense, is a digest of the accepted\r\nbeliefs of the military profession. In a narrower sense a military\r\ndoctrine may be confined to the views of a single commander on a\r\nspecific subject. The object of military doctrine, however, is always\r\nto furnish a basis for mutual understanding to the end that prompt and\r\nharmonious action by subordinate commanders may ensue without the\r\nnecessity for referring every problem to superior authority before\r\ntaking action (page 15). Doctrine thus provides a basis for action in\r\npossible situations when, for whatever reason, precise instructions\r\nhave not been issued.\r\n\r\nThe term \"doctrine\" is inappropriate as a description of the content\r\nof orders or instructions prescribing specific methods of action for a\r\nparticular tactical operation in a situation existent or assumed under\r\ncircumstances of the moment. The precise instructions thus issued,\r\nthough they may be the result of doctrine, and may themselves\r\nconstitute a basis for development of doctrine, are manifestly of the\r\nnature of something ordered rather than presented as authoritative\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nIn the broad field of the conduct of war, with its diversified\r\ndemands, a common viewpoint as to the application of fundamentals is\r\nan essential to unity of effort. If the members of the military\r\nprofession have this common viewpoint, their reasoned beliefs as to\r\nthe best general methods of waging a particular war may be expected\r\nmore nearly to approach unanimity. The attainment of unity of effort\r\ntherefore calls for an understanding of fundamentals (page i), a basic\r\nindoctrination which is not only sound but also common to all\r\ncommanders of the chain of command.\r\n\r\nWars come and go. Their effects are painful, but when their wounds are\r\nhealed mankind is prone to forget and to hope, even to assume, that\r\npeace will henceforth be unbroken. Psychological and economic forces\r\nthen not infrequently impel the State to subordinate the national\r\ndefense in favor of other interests. During such periods the burdens\r\nof command are enlarged. Its responsibility is not lessened, but the\r\nmeans for effective discharge thereof are withheld.\r\n\r\nThe effective conduct of war thus requires that understanding exist\r\n(see pages 9 and 10) between the civil representatives of the State\r\nand the leaders of the armed forces in the coordination of policy with\r\nthe preparation and the use of power to enforce it. Of the leaders of\r\nthe armed forces, as a whole or in combinations, such conduct of war\r\ndemands the expression of the highest of human qualities, coupled with\r\nintimate knowledge of fundamentals, an appreciation of the capacities\r\nand limitations of the technique, and the ability to fit the\r\npractical details into the general plan in their true relation\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nThe need for these qualities is manifestly not restricted to the hour\r\nof supreme test, when the weapon of the State, the armed forces, is\r\nwielded with hostile purpose. The forging of the weapon, and its\r\nadequate preparation for use, are not matters susceptible of deferment\r\nuntil the crucial hour. The exacting requirements of war are\r\nessentially such as to preclude the readiness of the requisite\r\nintricate instrument and its skillful use without previous studied\r\neffort during peace.\r\n\r\nIt follows that where the peacetime effort of the armed forces is\r\ndirected toward the attainment of a war time objective of a specific,\r\nrather than of a vaguely general character, and the necessary\r\ncomponents of fighting strength are provided accordingly, the\r\nreadiness of the instrument is more likely to be adequate, and the\r\napplication of power more likely to be successful. History records, as\r\nfacts, that certain States have given their armed forces great\r\nstimulus by early clear definition of policy while, in other cases,\r\nfailures and disappointments have resulted from a lack thereof.\r\nMilitary problems are not confined to those presented after war is\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nMental power (see pages 8 and 9), which includes the ability to solve\r\nmilitary problems in peace and in war and to arrive at sound\r\ndecisions, is a recognized essential component of fighting strength\r\nbecause it is the source of professional judgment. The development of\r\nsuch ability in those who may be charged with the successful conduct\r\nof war (page 4) may not safely be postponed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMENTAL PROCESSES AND HUMAN TENDENCIES\r\n\r\n    The discussion in Chapter II deals, first, with the natural\r\n    mental processes employed by the normal mature human being\r\n    before taking deliberate action.\r\n\r\n    With the necessity for logical thought thus established, there\r\n    arises a need for valid statements of cause and effect, i.e.,\r\n    of relationships resulting from the operation of natural laws,\r\n    for use as reliable rules of action. The discussion of this\r\n    subject explains the dangers inherent in the use of faulty\r\n    rules, emphasizes the role played by the various factors\r\n    applicable in particular cases, and describes the method of\r\n    formulating reliable rules, i.e., principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll living beings and their surroundings are understood, on the basis\r\nof informed authority, to be governed in their characteristic\r\nactivities by natural law (page 11). The natural forces inherent in\r\nliving things and in their environment are continually reacting upon\r\neach other, either maintaining the existing condition or creating a\r\nnew one, each of which is a situation or state of affairs. There is\r\nthus always a relationship (page 3) existing between such natural\r\nforces and the resultant condition which they produce. The natural\r\nforces are causes; the resultant conditions are effects.\r\n\r\nIt is a recognized natural phenomenon that every effect is the result\r\nof a certain cause, or of a combination of causes, and that each\r\neffect is itself, in turn, the cause of additional effects. Action and\r\nreaction are the basis of natural law. Cause and effect, the latter\r\nbeing the cause of further effects, follow each other in ceaseless\r\nsuccession in the world of human affairs.\r\n\r\nExcept by putting proper natural causes into action, it is impossible\r\nto produce the effect desired. It follows that specific knowledge of\r\ncauses is necessary for the planned production of specific effects.\r\nToward the accumulation of such knowledge the methods of science\r\n(pages 1 and 2) are constantly directed.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainties of war are largely the outgrowth of the fact that\r\nthe minds of men are pitted against one other. Because of this, a\r\nknowledge of the manner in which the human mind seeks its way out of\r\ndifficulties is a great military asset. Consideration is next given,\r\ntherefore, to the natural mental processes employed (page 11) and to\r\ncertain human tendencies which have been known to militate against\r\ntheir successful employment.\r\n\r\nThe mental processes employed by the normal mature human being before\r\ntaking deliberate action, or in making studied provision for possible\r\nfuture action, are natural procedures, in that they employ the\r\nintellectual powers bestowed by nature, without artificial\r\nmodification or embellishment.\r\n\r\nWhen the individual concerned has a background of adequate knowledge\r\nand experience, his ability to solve problems is limited only by his\r\nnative intellectual endowment. That he falls short does not\r\nnecessarily indicate, however, that the limit of native endowment has\r\nbeen reached. It happens frequently that latent powers have not been\r\ncultivated, or have not been utilized.\r\n\r\nA problem is, by definition, a perplexing question. In any human\r\nactivity, a problem appears when a perplexity arises as to a way out\r\nof a difficulty inherent in a situation. The question involved then\r\nis, what is a way, more especially the best way, out of the seeming\r\ndifficulty?\r\n\r\nTo determine the best way out of the difficulty, i.e., the best\r\nsolution of the problem, involves:\r\n\r\n        (1) The establishment of the proper basis for the\r\n    solution of the problem,\r\n\r\n        (2) The actual solution of the problem through the\r\n    employment of the reasoning power in the consideration of\r\n    various possible solutions and the selection of the best\r\n    solution, and\r\n\r\n        (3) The conclusion, i.e., the decision, embodying the best\r\n    solution.\r\n\r\nConsidered in greater detail, the process has its inception in a\r\ncombination of circumstances, existent or assumed, which, constitutes\r\na situation. No problem will result however, unless the situation\r\ninvolves an apparent difficulty. Even in such a case, a problem will\r\nresult only if such involvement exists and gives rise to a perplexity\r\nas to a way, more especially as to the best way, out of the seeming\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe problem will require solution only when accompanied by an\r\nincentive which demands a changed situation or resistance against a\r\nthreatened change. A recognition of the incentive thus necessarily\r\ninvolves realization of a desire or need to maintain the existing\r\nsituation or to change it into a new one.\r\n\r\nSuch realization may come on the initiative of the person confronted\r\nwith the situation, or because he has received instructions from\r\nsomeone in authority. In either case, the effect so indicated is the\r\noutcome of a desire for change or for resisting change, and may\r\ntherefore be regarded properly as an effect desired (page 19).\r\n\r\nAs so far outlined, therefore, the establishment of the correct basis\r\nfor the solution of the problem involves (1) a grasp of the salient\r\nfeatures of the situation, (2) a recognition of the incentive, and (3)\r\nan appreciation of the effect desired.\r\n\r\nThe \"appropriate\" effect desired will necessarily be suitable to the\r\nfurther effects (page 19) which are inherent in the situation. An\r\neffect to be attained is accepted as appropriate when, after due\r\nexamination, its relationship with the further effects involved, in\r\nall their pertinent implications, has been found to be in accordance\r\nwith the dictates of sound judgment.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the basis for the solution of the problem will\r\nalso require an understanding of the resources involved, as influenced\r\nby the conditions obtaining, for the maintenance of the existing\r\nsituation or for the creation of a new one.\r\n\r\nThe resources available, as influenced by the conditions obtaining,\r\nare correctly considered on a relative basis as compared to those of\r\nany persons who may oppose the effort.\r\n\r\nWith the basis for the solution of the problem established in this\r\nmanner, the actual solution involves the consideration of one or more\r\nplans, i.e., proposed methods of procedure, and the selection of the\r\none considered to be the best.\r\n\r\nThe person concerned, taking cognizance of the present condition,\r\ni.e., the existing situation, first considers whether this situation,\r\nif maintained, will be suitable to the appropriate effect desired.\r\nThen, unless satisfied that he desires no change, he creates one or\r\nmore images of future conditions, i.e., mental pictures of new\r\nsituations, which will also be suitable to this end. The maintenance\r\nof the existing situation, or the creation of a new one, will in each\r\ncase involve a plan.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, each such plan includes provision for (1) an effect to be\r\nproduced by the person solving the problem, which effect will be the\r\nmaintenance of the existing situation or the creation of a new one as\r\nvisualized by himself, and (2) the action required to produce this\r\neffect and so to attain the appropriate effect desired, already\r\nestablished as an essential part of the basis of his problem.\r\n\r\nAfter systematic examination of such plans, those retained for further\r\nconsideration can be subjected to a comparison as to their relative\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nThe best plan, selected accordingly, is then incorporated into a\r\ndecision as to the procedure to be adopted.\r\n\r\nThis decision is then available as a general plan, or may be developed\r\ninto one, to serve as a basis if necessary for a more detailed plan\r\nfor the attainment of the appropriate effect desired.\r\n\r\nLater development, herein, of the details of this procedure will\r\ndisclose many ramifications. The treatment, so far, points to the fact\r\nthat the best method of reaching sound decision is through systematic\r\nthought which employs logic, i.e., sound reasoning, as its machinery.\r\n\r\nThe Necessity for Logical Thought. Logical thought separates the\r\nrational from the irrational. Its use avoids the wastefulness of the\r\ntrial-and-error method. By its insistent employment, dormant powers of\r\nreasoning are awakened, and the danger that attends instinctive,\r\nspontaneous, impulsive, or emotional acceptance of conclusions (page\r\n9) is lessened. The evil effects of an inclination to dodge the issue\r\nor of a disinclination to face the facts are thus also avoided. The\r\nfallacy of employing the reasoning power to justify conclusions\r\nalready reached, whether on the basis of tradition or habit, or\r\nbecause of the bias or bent of a school of thought, or because of the\r\ntendency of human nature to accept plausible suggestions, is also made\r\napparent. Through the deliberate practice of testing and weighing, the\r\nfaculty of arriving swiftly at accurate decisions is strengthened and\r\nis brought more quickly into play when time is a matter of immediate\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nPrinciples in their Relation to Logical Thought. Because of the\r\nnecessity for the exercise of judgment (page 3) in the systematic\r\narrangement of thought, the relationship between cause and effect, as\r\nexpressed in principles, is of great assistance in applying logical\r\nprocesses to the problems of human life.\r\n\r\nA principle establishes a correct relation between cause and effect.\r\nThe word, derived from the Latin \"principium\", meaning a foundation,\r\nbeginning, source, origin, or cause, has, because a cause implies an\r\neffect, acquired in correct usage the significance of a true statement\r\nof relationship between cause and effect. A principle, so formulated,\r\nis a natural law (page 19) because it expresses a fact of nature; it\r\nthus becomes a reliable rule of action and may be confidently adopted\r\nas a governing law of conduct. If basic in its field, such a rule or\r\nlaw becomes a general or fundamental principle with respect thereto;\r\neach such basic truth may be the basis for the determination of many\r\ncorollary or subordinate principles dealing with the details of the\r\nparticular subject.\r\n\r\nThe formulation of a principle, therefore, requires the determination\r\nof the causes that generate a particular effect (or effects), and the\r\naccurate expression of the resultant relationship. Such expression\r\nfrequently takes the form of a proportion. In the mathematical\r\nsciences the proportion may represent a precise balance; its statement\r\nmay be an exact formula. In other sciences, a definite relationship\r\nbetween cause and effect has likewise been established in many cases,\r\nthough not always with mathematical precision. Comparable exactitude\r\nhas not been attained, in some cases, because the field has not been\r\nso thoroughly explored; moreover, greater difficulty is experienced,\r\nat times, in isolating the cause, or causes. The balance represented\r\nby such equations, therefore, is based on quantities whose weights\r\nvary within wide ranges. (See page 3.)\r\n\r\nHuman conduct does not lend itself to analysis as readily as do\r\nmathematical and physical phenomena. The advance in the psychological\r\nand sociological sciences is not so marked as in the physical, and the\r\nactions and reactions of the mind of man have not yet proved to be\r\nsusceptible of reduction to exact formulae. Nevertheless, man, in his\r\nintuitive search for valid guides for his own action, has been able,\r\nwith the advance of time, greatly to improve his own lot through the\r\nmedium of the scientific approach to human problems.\r\n\r\nThe insistent search of the human mind for reliable rules of action is\r\na recognized natural phenomenon. As understood on the basis of expert\r\ninvestigation of the subject, this trait results from the recognition,\r\nconscious or otherwise, by countless generations of mankind, of the\r\nrelationships between cause and effect as evidenced in the workings of\r\nthe laws of nature (page 22). A logical outcome, therefore, of\r\nexperience, this instinctive demand of the mind constitutes a force\r\nwhich defies opposition. Properly utilized, this force affords a\r\npowerful and natural aid in the solution of problems.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as a valid rule, or principle, is of great assistance in\r\narriving at sound decisions and in formulating effective plans (see\r\npage 22), this demand for reliable guides is logical, as well as\r\nnatural. In any event, the demand for such guidance, if not met by\r\nprovision for reliable rules of action, may result in the adoption of\r\nfaulty rules, with frequent unfortunate consequences.\r\n\r\nThe formulation of principles, already referred to in this connection,\r\nconstitutes in itself a recognized problem (see also page 27) of great\r\ndifficulty; for it is a human failing to avoid the mental effort\r\ninvolved in thinking through such a problem, and to rely on rules\r\nwhose plausibility and seeming simplicity are frequently a measure of\r\ntheir incompleteness and inaccuracy.\r\n\r\nSince the earliest days, man has attempted to formulate the\r\nrelationships between causes and effects without, however, always\r\npossessing the specific knowledge essential to accuracy. Pithy\r\nstatements have always had great appeal to man, as evidenced by the\r\nexistence of proverbs, maxims, and adages preserved from times of\r\ngreat antiquity. Frequently, however, such statements are not\r\nexpressive of the truth. Sometimes, again, they state facts, without,\r\nnevertheless, expressing the whole truth.\r\n\r\nOnly when the relationship between cause and effect has been\r\ndemonstrated to be always true can the trained, inquiring mind receive\r\nits statement as a valid guide, acceptable as a principle in the light\r\nof the knowledge of the day.\r\n\r\nTo rely upon rules of action which do not express the whole truth is\r\nto court the danger of encountering exceptions which may entail\r\nserious consequences. The value of those rules known to be\r\ninexpressive of the whole truth lies in the fact that they may invite\r\nattention to circumstances which are sometimes encountered, or may\r\nsuggest methods of action which are sometimes appropriate. Danger lies\r\nin the fact that such rules may fail to give proper emphasis to other\r\ncircumstances or other methods which are encountered or are more\r\nappropriate in other cases.\r\n\r\nSuch a rule may fail to consider the entire problem. Its use,\r\ntherefore, implies the necessity of recognizing cases to which it is\r\nnot applicable. This may frequently be difficult in the active\r\noperations of war, when nervous strain and the urgency of events are\r\nhandicaps to quick and accurate thinking (see page 22).\r\n\r\nTo express the whole truth, a rule of action calls to attention all\r\ncircumstances, or causes, which may ever influence the result. The\r\nsaying that \"the exception proves the rule\" is properly interpreted\r\nonly in the older sense that an exception \"tests\" the rule, indicating\r\nby the mere fact of exception that the rule is to such extent\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\nSubject to variations of phraseology, the old adage \"circumstances\r\nalter cases\" is the sole reliable and fundamental rule of action. A\r\ncorresponding maxim of the military profession, \"It depends on the\r\nsituation\", has its root in recognition of the same fact, i.e., that\r\nthe action taken in any situation depends, properly, on the\r\ncircumstances of the case, and that the relationship between cause and\r\neffect (page 22) is always the governing consideration. The principles\r\ndeduced hereafter (Chapter III) have these irrefutable findings as\r\ntheir foundation.\r\n\r\nFactors. A situation is by definition (page 20) a combination of\r\ncircumstances, which are the effects of certain causes. To these\r\ncauses, the term \"factors\", long in use in the military profession, is\r\ncustomarily applied in many other activities. Through their influence\r\nas causes, these factors operate to produce, as their effects, the\r\ncircumstances which, in combination, constitute the situation. A\r\ncombination of factors, therefore, gives to each situation its\r\ndistinctive character, differentiating it from other situations.\r\n\r\nTo maintain an existing situation, it is necessary to preserve, in\r\ntotal effect, the influence of factors already present, or to\r\nintroduce new factors to offset the influence of any which tend to\r\ncause a change. To change the situation, it is necessary to introduce\r\nfactors which will exert the desired influence; or, change may be\r\neffected by altering the influence of factors already present. To say,\r\ntherefore, that \"It depends on the situation\", as in the maxim cited\r\n(above), is to state that under all circumstances, the proper action\r\ndepends on, or is determined by, the influence of the factors\r\ninvolved. Any valid rule, or principle, will accordingly take into\r\naccount the factors applicable to the case.\r\n\r\nThe application of any rule will similarly take into account the\r\ninfluence of the particular factors involved. The danger of the\r\napplication of such factors to all circumstances, without due\r\ncircumspection as to their value in the existing situation, lies in\r\nthe fact that, in any particular combination of circumstances, they do\r\nnot necessarily carry equal weight.\r\n\r\nIf this view be accepted, it follows that in many situations certain\r\nfactors may, after mature deliberation, be rejected, or relegated to a\r\nrelatively inferior status, without detracting from their potential\r\nvalue as fundamental considerations (page 1) in all situations.\r\n\r\nValue and Limitations of Lists of Principles of War. The human\r\npreference for catchwords has, by many writers on the science and art\r\nof war, been extended to the attempted condensation of a principle or\r\nof several principles into a single all-inclusive word or phrase. As\r\na result, varying lists of abstract nouns and phrases have been\r\nadvanced to constitute epitomes of the principles of war. Subject to\r\nminor differences in number and in designation, the list most\r\nfrequently encountered comprises The Objective, Superiority, The\r\nOffensive, Economy of Force, Movement, Cooperation, Surprise,\r\nSecurity, and Simplicity.\r\n\r\nTo rely on a list of this nature, as a condensation of the\r\nfundamentals of war, has been known to cause confusion and to result\r\nin failure to recognize the principles which are intended to be\r\nbrought to mind.\r\n\r\nFor example, misunderstanding has resulted from the designation of the\r\nsingle word, surprise, as a \"principle of war\". On the one hand, it\r\nhas been denied that surprise embodies a principle, the reason being\r\nadvanced that it is neither always necessary, nor feasible, nor even\r\ndesirable to attempt to obtain surprise. On the other hand, the\r\nacceptance of the word surprise (see page 73), as itself expressing a\r\nuniversal truth (which it of course does not except by inference), has\r\nbeen known to result in the incorrect belief that surprise is always\r\nessential to success. Action based on such a viewpoint is the\r\nequivalent of applying general treatment to specific cases, regardless\r\nof circumstances.\r\n\r\nThus there have resulted distortions of the simple fact that a\r\nrelationship exists between the employment of the unexpected, and the\r\ncreation of a disadvantage which will hamper an opponent. The correct\r\nformulation of a principle, or of several principles, governing the\r\nemployment of surprise, will result in a definite statement that its\r\nappropriate employment is dependent upon the various factors (page 25)\r\nthat make up the situation, the influence of each of which requires\r\nevaluation in each separate situation.\r\n\r\nAnalysis, in like manner, of the so-called \"principle of the\r\nobjective\" as a \"principle of war\" will show that the objective of a\r\nmilitary force is, in itself, no more a principle of war than the\r\ndirection of a physical force is, in itself, a principle of mechanics.\r\nBoth concepts, however, involve certain matters of fact which can best\r\nbe explained by principles. Such principles take note of the factors\r\npertaining to the subjects, and indicate the underlying relationships\r\nin a manner to be later shown herein.\r\n\r\nCertainly the preceding list (above) of isolated expressions includes\r\nno item which, in the abstract, may not properly be considered as\r\npossibly vital from the strategical and tactical standpoints. But\r\nthat these expressions are always vital, and that there are no other\r\nconsiderations, can scarcely be accepted as final. Even if this\r\nobjection could be removed by the inclusion of all factors well known\r\nto be vital, the fact would still remain that these expressions,\r\nstanding alone, fail to satisfy the real need; i.e., they fail to\r\nindicate any practical application of the concepts which they are\r\nintended to imply. They do no more than provide a useful point of\r\norigin for further inquiry. When understood on this basis, they\r\npossess a certain value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe concept underlying the application of principles is correct with\r\nrespect to military problems, as well as for all others (page 22).\r\nThis purpose, however, cannot be served by a mere collection of nouns\r\nor noun-phrases. Such expressions make no statements of cause and\r\neffect. Their meaning is therefore left to inference and to the\r\nidiosyncrasy of individual interpretation. The formulation, moreover,\r\nof useful principles cannot be satisfactorily established by the\r\nmore-or-less random selection of matters, however important,\r\npertaining to the subject at hand. What is required is a systematic\r\nanalysis of the essentials of the subject, with resultant emphasis on\r\nthe fundamental causes and effects whose relationships are to be\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nFormulation and Use of Principles. The formulation of a principle,\r\nreferred to previously (page 24) as itself a difficult problem,\r\nrequires a citation of the factors pertaining to the subject. On the\r\nbasis of these factors as causes, the principles, when properly\r\nformulated, also state the effects which may properly be expected.\r\n(See page 22.)\r\n\r\nThe relationship between causes and effects, or between effects and\r\ntheir causes, may be expressed in various ways. The requirement is\r\nthat the expression be one of fact and that, if the principle purport\r\nto cover the entire subject, all of the pertinent facts (page 24) be\r\nstated, though not necessarily all the details involved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the principles of general application (Chapter III),\r\nthe later discussion herein includes numerous other principles, with\r\nreference to matters of detail (pages 22-23). To some of these\r\nprinciples the treatment invites special attention. All principles\r\nincluded have been phrased with due care, to ensure conformity with\r\nthe requirements above stated. The preferred form, herein, for the\r\nusual statement of cause and effect is through the use of phraseology\r\nsuch as that certain effects \"depend on\" or are \"dependent on\" certain\r\ncauses, or that certain causes \"determine\" certain effects, or that\r\nthe latter \"are determined by\" certain causes.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the exercise of judgment, it is a principle\r\nthat the due determination of effects to be produced depends on the\r\nproper consideration of pertinent factors. Once the principles\r\napplicable to any subject have been formulated in necessary detail,\r\nthe evaluation of the cited factors with respect to a particular\r\nsituation becomes the vital procedure as to any problem where that\r\nsubject is involved. In the course of this evaluation, corollary or\r\nsubordinate principles may be of assistance (page 22). In military\r\nproblems, however, the evaluation usually involves many factors not\r\nsusceptible of reasonably exact determination by the use of formulae\r\n(see page 23). In such cases, experience, education, and training\r\nafford the only secure basis for judgment which will produce reliable\r\nconclusions. The principles, therefore, provide reliable guides by\r\nciting the factors to be evaluated in order to arrive at desired\r\nresults, but the principles cannot replace logical thought in the\r\nevaluation of the factors.\r\n\r\nIn formulating principles (see also page 23) as practical guides for\r\naction, as well as in using them when formulated, failure to give\r\nconsideration to all pertinent factors may result in vitiating the\r\neffort based on their application. Danger also lies in the fact that\r\nany particular factor will infrequently have the same value--the same\r\ninfluence on the situation--in any two problems (page 25). Therefore,\r\nin each situation, each factor requires to be weighed in connection\r\nwith the others. The soundness of the resulting conclusion will depend\r\non the extent of the knowledge available (page 2) and on its useful\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nSummary of Fundamental Considerations. The factors (page 25) involved\r\nin determining the nature of an effect and of the action to attain it\r\nbecome fundamental considerations (page 25) when it is desired to\r\narrive at such a result under a particular set of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe relationships obtaining between the desired effect and the action\r\nto attain it, on the one hand, and the factors involved, on the other,\r\nare best expressed in the form of principles. The next chapter is\r\ntherefore devoted to the development of basic principles applicable to\r\nmilitary problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBASIC PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO MILITARY PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n(The Fundamental Military Principle)\r\n\r\n    On the basis of the previous discussion as to the natural\r\n    mental processes and as to principles useful in their\r\n    employment, Chapter III discusses the requirements for the\r\n    attainment of an end in human affairs.\r\n\r\n    The fundamental principle thus derived is then applied to the\r\n    needs of the military profession, so as to develop the\r\n    Fundamental Military Principle. This Principle indicates the\r\n    requirements of a correct military objective and of the action\r\n    for its attainment.\r\n\r\n\r\nReview of Conclusions as to Principles. On the premise that all human\r\nactivities and their environment are governed by natural laws (page\r\n22), the preceding chapter has been devoted to an analysis of the\r\nnatural mental processes employed in meeting the problems of human\r\nlife. This analysis has stressed four fundamental truths:\r\n\r\n    (1) That a valid rule, or principle, when complete, embraces\r\n        all known phenomena pertinent to the relationship\r\n        established.\r\n\r\n    (2) That the logical application of principles to particular\r\n        incidents will take account of all the factors of the\r\n        principles, and of all known conditions of the incidents.\r\n\r\n    (3) That such principles afford great assistance in arriving\r\n        at sound conclusions, and that the human mind, if without\r\n        access to such valid guides, tends to adopt faulty rules\r\n        in the effort to serve the same purpose.\r\n\r\n    (4) That rules of action, however, even though they be valid,\r\n        cannot be depended upon to replace the employment of\r\n        logical thought.\r\n\r\nProcedure for Developing Military Principles. Logically, the next\r\nstage in the treatment of this subject is to develop certain basic\r\nprinciples applicable, more especially, to the solution of military\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nThe development of such principles starts, on the basis already\r\nestablished in this discussion, with a reference to the natural mental\r\nprocesses used by the normal mature human being before taking\r\ndeliberate action (page 19). Under such circumstances, the person who\r\nis to solve the problem has first to establish a basis for his\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nTo arrive at this basis, which involves an understanding of the\r\nappropriate effect desired, the person concerned requires a grasp of\r\nthe salient features of the situation, a recognition of the incentive,\r\nand an appreciation of the effect which he has been directed to\r\nproduce or has adopted on his own initiative. To complete the basis\r\nfor his solution, he also requires an understanding of comparative\r\nresources as influenced by the conditions obtaining at the time.\r\n\r\nDuring the actual solution of the problem, the person concerned takes\r\ncognizance first, of the existing situation, picturing it in his mind.\r\nThen, unless satisfied that he desires no change, he creates for\r\nhimself mental images of future situations. The pictured condition\r\ndecided upon after consideration of the pertinent factors involved, be\r\nit the situation to be maintained or a new situation to be created,\r\nconstitutes an effect he may produce for the further attainment of the\r\nappropriate effect desired, already established as an essential part\r\nof the basis of his problem. (See page 25.)\r\n\r\nWith the existing situation and a new situation now clear, what action\r\nis he to take to change the one into the other? Or, if no change is\r\ndesired, what action is he to take to maintain the existing situation?\r\nWhat acts or series of acts should he decide upon, plan in detail,\r\ninaugurate, and supervise (page 3), to attain the effect which he has\r\nenvisaged for the further attainment of the appropriate effect\r\ndesired?\r\n\r\nThe correct solution of problems therefore hinges on the requirements\r\ninvolved in the effects to be produced and in the action to produce\r\nthem. If these requirements are ascertained, a principle can be\r\nformulated as a valid guide for the solution of human problems.\r\n\r\nRequirements for the Attainment of an End. The discussion to this\r\npoint has established the fact that an end in view, a result to be\r\nproduced, an effect desired, is very closely connected with a further\r\neffect which the attainment of the former is intended to produce.\r\nHuman motives spring from deep-seated incentives often derived from\r\ndistant sources, so that, even when the person concerned is acting\r\nwholly on his own initiative, he will rarely, if ever, be uninfluenced\r\nby some further effect desired, inherent in his situation (see page\r\n19).\r\n\r\nAn end in view, therefore, from the viewpoint of the person who is\r\nendeavoring to visualize its accomplishment as a method for attainment\r\nof a further aim, will necessarily achieve such further aim, or at\r\nleast contribute to its achievement. The first requirement,\r\naccordingly, of such an end in view is that it be suitable to any\r\nfurther aim, whatever that aim may be. It may be said, therefore, that\r\na correct end in view satisfies the requirement of suitability as to\r\nthe appropriate effect desired, whatever this further effect may be.\r\n\r\nImportant as suitability is, however, a reasonably responsible person\r\nwill recognize that this consideration, alone, does not satisfy all\r\nrequirements. An end in view remains a mere desire, without\r\npossibility of attainment, unless such a result is practicable of\r\naccomplishment. A correct end in view, therefore, satisfies also the\r\nrequirements of feasibility.\r\n\r\nConsideration of feasibility calls for a survey of comparative\r\nresources (page 30). Such a survey will cover the extent of the\r\nresources (means available) of those making the effort, as compared to\r\nthe resources (means opposed) of those who may oppose it. Full account\r\nis also to be taken, as to feasibility, of the natural and artificial\r\nconditions which the effort will encounter before it can produce the\r\ncontemplated result. The responsible person will ask himself where the\r\neffort is most likely to be successful, and what obstacles, in\r\naddition to those represented by opponents, he will be required to\r\nsurmount. The effects of such conditions may alter the ratio otherwise\r\npresented by comparative resources.\r\n\r\nConsideration of the characteristics of the field of action may thus\r\ndisclose features which will greatly influence the possibility of\r\naccomplishment, as well as the character of the effort to be made,\r\nfrom the standpoint of feasibility. The second requirement, therefore,\r\nis that of feasibility with respect to comparative resources, i.e.,\r\nthe means available and opposed, as influenced by the physical\r\nconditions prevailing in the field of action.\r\n\r\nAlthough believed to be both suitable and feasible, the requirements\r\nfor the attainment of an end are not yet completely established. There\r\nis still required a reckoning of a profit-and-loss account of the\r\nwhole undertaking, to estimate whether it will be advantageous. What\r\nwill be the cost, and what will be the gain? Is the effort worth\r\nwhile? Or should one be content with venturing less and gaining less?\r\nWhat is the bearing on possible future action? The consequences as to\r\ncosts, always important considerations in dealing with human problems,\r\nare frequently the paramount determinant. The third requirement,\r\ntherefore, is acceptability with respect to the consequences as to\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\nThese requirements invite attention to the factors, already\r\ndiscussed, whose influence (see page 25 as to factors) determines the\r\ncharacter of the effort required to attain an end.\r\n\r\nThe Fundamental Principle for the Attainment of an End. Here, then,\r\nare the broad fundamental considerations which affect the solution of\r\nevery human problem. In a narrower field, the considerations may fall\r\nwithin more specific limits, but a principle sufficiently broad to be\r\napplicable to all cases appears to comprehend those inclusive factors\r\nmentioned in the preceding paragraphs.\r\n\r\nA review of these paragraphs will disclose that the factors pertaining\r\nto the several requirements may be so grouped as to constitute a\r\nsingle fundamental principle governing the attainment of an end in\r\nhuman affairs,--as follows:\r\n\r\nIn any human activity, the attainment of a correct end in view depends\r\non fulfillment of the requirements of\r\n\r\n    Suitability of the end in view, as determined by the factor\r\n        of the appropriate effect desired,\r\n\r\n    Feasibility of the effort required, on the basis of\r\n        comparative resources, as determined by the means\r\n        available and opposed, influenced by the factor of the\r\n        physical conditions prevailing in the field of action, and\r\n\r\n    Acceptability of the results of the effort involved, as\r\n        determined by the factor of the consequences as to costs,\r\n\r\n    which factors are in turn dependent on each other.\r\n\r\nThe Interdependency of the Factors. As previously observed (page 28),\r\nthe factors cited in the foregoing principle are themselves\r\ninterdependent. This fact results from working of natural law (page\r\n22), for it is a recognized phenomenon that every effect is the result\r\nof certain causes, and that every effect is itself, in turn, the cause\r\nof further effects (page 19).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when the evaluation of any factor is under consideration,\r\nits value as an unknown quantity can be determined to the extent that\r\nthe values of the other pertinent factors are known. (See page 23, as\r\nto the discussion of the quantities in an equation.) The significance\r\nof each, in any situation, is therefore determined by the influence of\r\nthe other factors. The relationships existing among them can best be\r\nexpressed in the terms of four corollary principles (page 27), next to\r\nbe discussed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor example, questions frequently arise as to what is the appropriate\r\neffect to be desired in a particular situation. Whether a desired\r\neffect is feasible of attainment, and whether certain consequences,\r\nthough undesirable, will be acceptable, in view of the gains, can be\r\ndetermined by evaluation of the means available and opposed,\r\ninfluenced by the physical conditions prevailing in the field of\r\naction, and of the consequences as to costs. If a desired effect is\r\nthereby found to be not feasible of attainment, or to be unacceptable\r\nas to consequences, deferment of such effort is indicated. A proper\r\nsolution in such case would adopt some lesser effect, in conformity\r\nwith the further aim, feasible of accomplishment, and acceptable as to\r\nits consequences.\r\n\r\nIf (with respect to the further aim, mentioned above) the person\r\nconcerned is acting under the instructions of another, there will\r\nfrequently be injected into the equation, in addition to the factors\r\nalready noted, a further effect desired, indicated by higher\r\nauthority. Such an indication will often operate to narrow the limits\r\nof the problem. This is true even if the person concerned is acting\r\nwholly on his own initiative and responsibility (pages 29-30).\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead to the formulation of what may be called the\r\ncorollary principle for determination of the appropriate effect to be\r\ndesired in human affairs,--as follows:\r\n\r\n  In any human activity, the appropriate effect to be desired\r\n  (i.e., an end in view, a result to be accomplished) depends on\r\n  fulfillment of the requirements of\r\n\r\n    Suitability of the end in view, as determined by the factor of\r\n        the further effect desired (if such further effect is\r\n        indicated),\r\n\r\n    Feasibility of the effort to attain the end in view, on the\r\n        basis of comparative resources, as determined by the\r\n        factors of the means available and opposed, influenced by\r\n        the factor of the physical conditions prevailing in the\r\n        field of action, and\r\n\r\n    Acceptability of the results of the effort involved, as\r\n        determined by the factor of the consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf, to take a further example, the known factors include the\r\nappropriate effect desired, the means opposed, the physical conditions\r\nprevailing in the field of action, and the consequences as to costs,\r\nthe only unknown remains the means available. The question then is,\r\nwhat means need be made available for the accomplishment of the\r\ncontemplated effort? The answer to this question may be found in the\r\napplication of what may be called the principle for the determination\r\nof the proper means to be made available in human affairs,--as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  In any human activity, the proper means to be made available\r\n  depend on fulfillment of the requirements of\r\n\r\n    Suitability of the means (in kind and amount) to accomplish\r\n        the end in view, as determined by the factor of the\r\n        appropriate effect desired,\r\n\r\n    Feasibility of the effort to make such means available on the\r\n        basis of comparative resources as determined by the factor\r\n        of the means opposed, influenced by the factor of the\r\n        physical conditions prevailing in the field of action, and\r\n\r\n    Acceptability of the results of the effort involved, as\r\n        determined by the factor of the consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe influence of physical conditions in the field of action may be\r\nillustrated by any case where ends otherwise feasible of attainment\r\ncannot be achieved without effecting changes in such conditions. The\r\nresolution of the uncertainty then requires study to determine what\r\nsuitable changes can be made. Changes for such a purpose may take\r\nvarious forms, such as the construction of physical features in the\r\narea involved, or the destruction of such features already existing;\r\nor, again, both methods may be employed. Examples of such changes have\r\nexisted and still exist in profusion, some of them, military and\r\nnon-military, being on such a scale as radically to alter the previous\r\nstatus with respect to entire nations. The question as to what changes\r\nought to be effected in the prevailing physical conditions, in order\r\nto attain a certain objective, can be answered by the application of\r\nwhat may be called the principle for the determination of the proper\r\nphysical conditions to be established in the field of action,--as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  In any human activity, the proper physical conditions to be\r\n  established in the field of action depend on fulfillment of the\r\n  requirements of\r\n\r\n    Suitability of such conditions to the end in view, as\r\n        determined by the factor of the appropriate effect\r\n        desired,\r\n\r\n    Feasibility of effort to establish such conditions, on the\r\n        basis of comparative resources, as determined by the\r\n        factors of the means available and opposed, influenced by\r\n        the factor of the physical conditions existing in the\r\n        field of action, and\r\n\r\n    Acceptability of the results of the effort involved, as\r\n        determined by the factor of the consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe factor of consequences as to costs also calls for special notice.\r\nThe influence of this factor frequently justifies abandonment of\r\nsuitable ends in view, even though their attainment has been\r\ndetermined to be feasible, because the loss involved would out-weigh\r\nthe gain. Immediate success may be attained at such cost as to prevent\r\nthe attainment of larger ends (see the discussion, pages 9 and 10, of\r\nthe relationship of strategy and tactics).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the circumstances of the case may well justify\r\nloss, however great, because the alternative is unacceptable, even\r\nthough the consequences involve complete destruction. Moreover, the\r\nneed for swift and aggressive action in many activities (notably in\r\nwar), for resolute prosecution of the plan, for timely seizure of\r\nopportunity, and for acceptance of justified risks, requires that\r\nconsideration of consequences as to costs never be emphasized beyond\r\nits proper weight. To determine such proper weight calls, frequently,\r\nfor judgment of the highest order, and is, in the military profession,\r\na direct responsibility of command. This responsibility can be\r\ndischarged by the application of what may be called the corollary\r\nprinciple for the determination of acceptable consequences as to\r\ncosts,--as follows:\r\n\r\n  In any human activity, the acceptable consequences as to costs\r\n    depend on fulfillment of the requirements of\r\n\r\n    Suitability of the end in view, as determined by the factor\r\n        of the appropriate effect desired, and\r\n\r\n    Feasibility of the effort to attain the end in view, on the\r\n        basis of comparative resources, as determined by the\r\n        factors of the means available and opposed, influenced by\r\n        the factor of the physical conditions prevailing in the\r\n        field of action.\r\n\r\nSpecial Nature of War as a Human Activity. A principle found, by\r\ncareful analysis, to be governing as to human activities of any\r\nnature, is also applicable to the problems of war. This is true\r\nbecause war is a human activity, differing from other human activities\r\nonly in the specialized character of the factors that enter.\r\n\r\nThe effect desired in war has a character distinctly military and,\r\nultimately, through the reestablishment of a favorable peace, a\r\npolitical character (see pages 7-9).\r\n\r\nThe means available (or opposed) in war are the human and material\r\ncomponents of fighting strength (page 8). The physical conditions\r\nprevailing in the field of action are, in war, the characteristics of\r\nthe theater of operations. Fighting strength is thus derived from the\r\nmeans available (or opposed) in war, as influenced by the\r\ncharacteristics of the theater. Relative fighting strength\r\n(comparative resources in war) involves a comparison of means\r\navailable with means opposed, due account being taken of the influence\r\nexerted on both by the characteristics of the theater. In war,\r\nrelatively large masses of human beings oppose each other with hostile\r\nintent, while the means available and opposed, and the physical\r\nconditions established by the operations of war in the theater of\r\naction, tend more and more to acquire a highly specialized character.\r\n\r\nThe consequences as to costs, in war, also assume a special\r\nsignificance, inasmuch as they may materially influence the\r\ndevelopment of entire nations or of the world situation.\r\n\r\nFactors as Universal Determinants in War. Tabulated for convenient\r\nreference and expressed in terms in general use in the military\r\nprofession, the factors governing the attainment of an end in war are\r\ntherefore:\r\n\r\n  (a) The Nature of the appropriate Effect Desired,\r\n  (b) The Means Available and Opposed,\r\n  (c) The Characteristics of the Theater of Operations,\r\n      and\r\n  (d) The Consequences as to Costs.\r\n\r\nThese factors, thus expressed in abstract form, are the universal\r\ndeterminants of the nature of the objective and of the character of\r\nthe action to attain it. Their further resolution into factors of more\r\nconcrete form is indicated hereinafter (see Chapter VI, in the\r\ndiscussion of Section II of the Estimate Form).\r\n\r\nThe Objective in War. The objective (page 3), a term long in use in\r\nthe military profession in connection with the \"objective point\", has\r\nacquired by extension the significance of something more than the\r\nphysical object of action. The latter, as explained later (page 37),\r\nis properly denominated the \"physical objective\".\r\n\r\nIn the abstract, an \"objective\", in present general usage as well as\r\nin the military vocabulary, is an end toward which action is being\r\ndirected, or is to be directed; in brief, an end in view, a result to\r\nbe attained, an effect desired (pages 19 and 30). An objective is an\r\neffect to be produced for the attainment of a further objective,\r\nitself a further effect. As already demonstrated (page 30 and\r\nfollowing), the attainment of an end, in any human activity, requires\r\naction to maintain the existing situation or to create a new one.\r\nTherefore, in war, a special form of human activity, the attainment of\r\nan objective requires that action be actual imposition of an outside\r\nagency. The attainment of a correct military objective (discussed in\r\ndetail in Chapter IV) requires, accordingly, the creation or\r\nmaintenance of a favorable military situation.\r\n\r\nAn objective, in the sense of an end in view, a result to be\r\naccomplished, is manifestly an objective in mind. As already indicated\r\n(page 36), however, military usage also assigns to the term\r\n\"objective\" an additional meaning, a meaning exclusively concrete.\r\nResults in war are attained through the actual or threatened use of\r\nphysical force (pages 8 and 9) directed with relation to something\r\ntangible, such as, for example, some physical element of the enemy's\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nAction as to this tangible feature (e.g., if it is destroyed,\r\noccupied, neutralized, or otherwise dealt with) will result in, or\r\nfurther the attainment of, an effect desired. Thus the physical\r\nobjective occupies a sharply defined position in warfare, in that it\r\nestablishes the physical basis of the objective and indicates the\r\ngeographical direction of the effort. Since the physical objective is\r\nalways an object--be it only a geographical point--, it is more than a\r\nmental concept; it is an objective in space.\r\n\r\nFor example, the objective being \"the destruction of the enemy\r\nbattleship\", the physical objective is the enemy battleship.\r\n\r\nAs used herein the expression \"the objective\" or \"the military\r\nobjective\" (page 55), when unqualified, ordinarily indicates the\r\nmental objective. The term is properly applicable to a physical\r\nobjective when the context makes the meaning clear. Ordinarily, and\r\nalways when clarity demands, a tangible focus of effort is herein\r\ndenoted a \"physical objective\".\r\n\r\nMilitary Operations. Appropriate action to create or maintain a\r\nsituation will take the form of a military operation. An operation, in\r\nthe basic sense, is merely an act, or a series of acts. The word is\r\nderived from the Latin opus, meaning \"work\". A military operation is\r\ntherefore an act, or a series of included acts (i.e., work), of a\r\nmilitary character. A military operation may consist of an entire\r\ncampaign, or even of several such, constituting a clearly defined\r\nmajor stage in a war; or such an operation may consist of portions\r\nthereof. The term is also applied, properly, to entire series of acts\r\non the part of successive commands, from the higher to the lower\r\nechelons, to and including distinctive military actions which relate\r\nto the merest routine.\r\n\r\nA plan of action to attain a military objective is, therefore, a plan\r\nof military operations, including supporting measures (see page 167),\r\nconsidered or adopted as a method of procedure for the achievement of\r\nthat end (see page 21). Such a plan or method of procedure requires\r\naction with relation to correct physical objectives in such a manner\r\nas to attain the objective, i.e., to maintain the existing situation\r\nor to create a new one, conformably to the appropriate effect desired.\r\n\r\nA plan of military operations may be regarded as reasonably effective\r\nif the direction or geographical trend of the effort provides for\r\nproper action with relation to the correct physical objectives; if the\r\nforce concerned utilizes positions advantageous in relation to those\r\nof the opponent; if the fighting strength is so apportioned as to\r\nprovide for requisite power at points likely to be decisive, without\r\nundue weakening at other points; and if future actions, in seeking the\r\neffect desired, will be unhampered by obstacles with which the force\r\ncannot cope. These essentials apply to all of the various combinations\r\nof circumstances, i.e., situations (page 20), which may materialize as\r\naction progresses and the original situation unfolds.\r\n\r\nA properly conceived plan of military operations therefore makes\r\nprovision, necessarily, for certain salient features of such\r\noperations, as follows:\r\n\r\n  The physical objectives involved,\r\n  The relative positions utilized,\r\n  The apportionment of fighting strength, and\r\n  The provisions for freedom of action.\r\n\r\nAs will later be observed (Chapters VII and VIII), the content of\r\nplans for naval operations may be classified under the headings listed\r\nabove. In such plans the salient features noted will be observed,\r\nalso, to occur, subject to certain exceptions, in the sequence above\r\nindicated. Similar observations are applicable as to plans\r\nsystematically prepared for direction of forces operating on land and\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\nA military operation which is progressing favorably, whatever the\r\nmedium of action, may therefore be justifiably stated to include\r\nprovision for the following salient features:\r\n\r\n      Effective action with relation to correct physical\r\n  objectives,\r\n\r\n      Projection of military action from advantageous relative\r\n  positions,\r\n\r\n      Proper apportionment of fighting strength, and\r\n\r\n      Ensurance of adequate freedom of action.\r\n\r\nSince, at any moment of its successful prosecution, a military\r\noperation presents, inherently (page 38), a favorable military\r\nsituation, the salient features of such an operation constitute, also,\r\nthe salient features of a favorable military situation. Manifestly,\r\nany deficiencies in these respects will indicate that in certain\r\nparticulars the situation is not entirely favorable, if not actually\r\nunfavorable.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the Salient Features. Because the form which a\r\nmilitary operation takes, in the effort to attain a military\r\nobjective, depends upon the factors which are the universal\r\ndeterminants (page 36) of the character of the effort, the salient\r\nfeatures of such an operation are determined by the same factors. A\r\nvalid guide as to determination of the salient features of a favorably\r\nprogressing military operation, seen (above) to be identical with\r\nthose of a favorable military situation, may therefore be formulated\r\nas a principle for determining these salient features, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe determination of\r\n\r\n                             }         { Suitability, as determined by\r\n                             }         { the factor of the appropriate\r\nCorrect physical objectives, }         { effect desired.\r\n                             }         {\r\nAdvantageous relative        }         { Feasibility, by reason of\r\n positions,                  }         { relative fighting strength,\r\n                             } depends { as determined by the factors\r\nProper apportionment of      } on      { of the means available and\r\nfighting strength, and       } their   { opposed, influenced by the\r\n                             }         { factor of the characteristics\r\nProvision for adequate       }         { of the theater of operations,\r\nfreedom of action            }         { and\r\n                             }         {\r\n                             }         { Acceptability, as determined\r\n                             }         { by the factor of the\r\n                             }         { consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\nSince the particular character of each salient feature of a situation,\r\nor of an operation, is determined by the influence, exerted by the\r\nidentical factors (as noted), there is a resulting interdependency,\r\nimportant though indirect, among the several features. This\r\ninterdependency is explained hereafter. (Chapter IV).\r\n\r\nThe Fundamental Military Principle. The Fundamental Principle for the\r\nAttainment of an End in human affairs (page 32) has invited\r\nattention to the factors, pertinent to suitability, feasibility, and\r\nacceptability, seen to be applicable, as well, to any military effort\r\n(page 35). As also noted, a military effort will necessarily consist\r\nof military operations, whose salient features depend upon the same\r\nfactors. The factors, in turn, have been observed (page 32 and\r\nfollowing) to be interdependent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FUNDAMENTAL MILITARY PRINCIPLE (diagram)]\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead to the formulation of a derivative of the\r\nFundamental Principle for the Attainment of an End in human affairs,\r\nin the form of\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fundamental Military Principle\r\n\r\nThe attainment of a military objective (the creation or maintenance of\r\na favorable military situation) depends on effective operations\r\ninvolving the salient features of\r\n\r\n    Effective action with relation to correct physical\r\n        objectives,\r\n\r\n    Projection of action from advantageous relative positions,\r\n\r\n    Proper apportionment of fighting strength, and\r\n\r\n    Ensurance of adequate freedom of action,\r\n\r\n    each fulfilling the requirements of\r\n\r\n    Suitability, as determined by the factor of the appropriate\r\n        effect desired,\r\n\r\n    Feasibility, by reason of relative fighting strength as\r\n        determined by the factors of the means available and\r\n        opposed, influenced by the factor of the characteristics\r\n        of the theater of operations, and\r\n\r\n    Acceptability, as determined by the factor of the consequences\r\n        as to costs,\r\n\r\n    which factors are in turn dependent on each other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Fundamental Military Principle, as a valid guide, encounters no\r\nexception in the field it purports to cover. As a practical guide, it\r\nbrings to attention, in broad outline, all the causes and effects\r\nwhich are involved. The principle affords a proper basis for the\r\nformulation of corollary principles for the determination, in any\r\nparticular situation, of any element noted therein whose value may be\r\nunknown but may be ascertained by reference to other pertinent\r\nelements which constitute known quantities. (See pages 21-27.)\r\n\r\nAs later explained (Chapter IV), the two major applications of the\r\nPrinciple relate to the selection of a correct military objective and\r\nto the determination of effective military operations to attain an\r\nobjective (see page 28).\r\n\r\nA corollary Principle of the Correct Military Objective will\r\naccordingly state that the selection of a correct military objective\r\ndepends on the due consideration of the salient features and the\r\nfactors cited in the Fundamental Military Principle. The application\r\nof this corollary is discussed in Section II of Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nA corollary Principle of Effective Military Operations will similarly\r\nstate that the determination of effective operations for the\r\nattainment of a military objective depends on the due consideration of\r\nthe salient features and the factors cited in the Fundamental Military\r\nPrinciple. The application of this corollary is explained in Section\r\nIII of Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nThese principles can be used as a basis for formulating the plans of\r\nthe commander concerned, and, accordingly, for determining his own\r\naction. They can also be used as a basis for rendering sound opinions,\r\nwhen requested of the commander, as to plans and actions contemplated\r\nby higher authority. The principles are in like manner applicable for\r\npurposes of historical study involving analysis of operations of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE APPLICATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL MILITARY PRINCIPLE\r\n\r\n(Objectives--Their Selection and Attainment)\r\n\r\n    Section I of Chapter IV discusses the major components of all\r\n    military problems.\r\n\r\n    Section II deals with the fundamental considerations having to\r\n    do, generally, with the first of these components, i.e., the\r\n    selection of correct military objectives; the application,\r\n    more specifically, is reserved for Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n    Section III deals with the fundamental considerations having\r\n    to do, generally, with the second of the two major components,\r\n    i.e., the determination of effective military operations for\r\n    the attainment of such objectives; the application, more\r\n    specifically, is reserved for Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n    The selection of objectives has a secondary application, also,\r\n    to the discussion in Chapter VII, while the determination of\r\n    operations has a similar application to that in Chapter VI.\r\n    Both subjects, i.e., as to objectives and as to operations,\r\n    have application also to Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n    The chart on page ii shows these relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MAJOR COMPONENTS OF MILITARY PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\nIn the two preceding chapters, the study of the natural mental\r\nprocesses has brought to notice that, to meet the requirements of\r\nsuitability, feasibility, and acceptability as to consequences in the\r\nproper solution of a military problem, it is first necessary to\r\nestablish a sound basis for that solution. Such a basis involves an\r\nunderstanding of the appropriate effect desired and of relative\r\nfighting strength (see pages 29 and 30).\r\n\r\nIn each situation an understanding of the appropriate effect desired,\r\nfrom the standpoint of suitability, requires:\r\n\r\n        (1) A grasp of the salient features of the situation,\r\n    favorable and unfavorable, including the perplexity inherent\r\n    therein,\r\n\r\n        (2) A recognition of the incentive to solution of the\r\n    problem, i.e., a realization of the desire or need for\r\n    attaining a certain effect, an objective (page 36) which will\r\n    be the maintenance or creation of a favorable military\r\n    situation, and\r\n\r\n        (3) An appreciation of this objective in its relationship\r\n    to the next further result to be accomplished by its\r\n    attainment.\r\n\r\nAn understanding of relative fighting strength involves consideration\r\nof the means available and opposed, as influenced by the\r\ncharacteristics of the theater of operations. With this understanding\r\nthere is provided a sound basis for the determination, later, of the\r\nfeasibility of courses of action and of their acceptability with\r\nrespect to consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\nIn the premises, the ability to understand the nature of a military\r\nproblem is dependent on the knowledge, experience, character, and\r\nprofessional judgment of the commander. These qualities enable him to\r\ngrasp the significance of the salient features of the situation. The\r\nsame personal characteristics are instrumental in the recognition of\r\nthe incentive. Analysis indicates that an incentive may arise (1) by\r\nreason of a directive issued by higher authority, or (2) from the fact\r\nthat a decision already reached by the commander has introduced\r\nfurther problems, or (3) because of the demands of the situation.\r\nHowever, the primary consideration in understanding the nature of the\r\nproblem is the appreciation of the objective from which the problem\r\noriginates, i.e., the just estimation or accurate evaluation of this\r\nobjective. Such consideration is primary because appreciation of this\r\nobjective involves, as necessary concomitants, a grasp of the salient\r\nfeatures of the existing situation (to be maintained or changed) and a\r\nrecognition of the incentive.\r\n\r\nCorrect appreciation of this objective, in its relationship to the\r\nfurther effect to be produced, is thus the principal consideration in\r\nreaching an understanding of the appropriate effect desired. It is, to\r\nrepeat, through an understanding of this factor and of the factors of\r\nrelative fighting strength that the commander establishes the basis\r\nfor the solution of his problem. (See Section I of Chapter VI, page\r\n118).\r\n\r\nThe Solution of a Military Problem. When the commander has thus\r\nobtained an understanding of the basis of his problem, the actual\r\nprocedure of solution is undertaken through the consideration of the\r\nfactors involved in their influence on the various plans for the\r\nattainment of the appropriate effect desired, as thus established. The\r\nbest plan, selected and embodied in outline in the decision, can then\r\nbe further developed, if necessary, into a general plan for the\r\ncommander's force and, finally, into a detailed plan, as the solution\r\nof the problem. (See page 22.)\r\n\r\nThe Major Components of a Military Problem. Each plan considered by\r\nthe commander will involve (page 21) two major considerations:\r\nnamely--an effect to be produced and the action required to produce\r\nit; or, in military terms, a correct military objective (or\r\nobjectives) and effective operations for its attainment. The selection\r\nof correct military objectives and the determination of effective\r\noperations for their attainment are therefore the two major components\r\nof a military problem, because they are the principal considerations\r\non which depends the soundness of military decision. To meet these\r\nrequirements is a prime function of command, one which demands\r\nprofessional judgment of the highest order.\r\n\r\nThe major components of a military problem are of course intimately\r\nconnected, because a purposeful action, accomplished, is equivalent to\r\nan objective, attained. Furthermore, the attainment of an objective\r\ninvolves the accomplishment of effective operations.\r\n\r\nBecause of the importance of the subject, the relationship between\r\nthese two major components deserves very careful analysis. As has been\r\nobserved (page 30), the action to be taken depends, in the first\r\ninstance, on the effect to be produced. Therefore, the objective is,\r\nas compared to the action to attain it, the paramount matter.\r\nMoreover, there is necessarily included, in the procedure of selecting\r\na correct objective, a consideration as to whether the action to that\r\nend will be feasible and as to whether the consequences involved will\r\nbe acceptable on the basis of the costs which will be exacted. If,\r\nthen, the objective has been correctly selected in any situation, this\r\nprocedure will have included, as a necessary incidental, the\r\ndetermination also, in the proper detail, of the operations required\r\nfor its attainment.\r\n\r\nOf the two major components involved in the selection of the best\r\nplan, the primary relates, therefore, to correct objectives.\r\nAccordingly, this consideration is most aptly expressed in terms of\r\nthe \"selection\" of objectives. The \"determination\" of necessary\r\noperations is a proper expression of the procedure therein involved,\r\nbecause this procedure, though also involving a major component of the\r\nproblem is dependent on the primary consideration of objectives.\r\n\r\nA valid guide for practical use during the process of solving military\r\nproblems will therefore provide a basis, primarily, for the selection\r\nof correct objectives. However, the procedure for such selection,\r\nthough requiring consideration of the action involved in attaining\r\nobjectives, will seldom call for a complete analysis of such\r\noperations. Therefore, it is also desirable, for the solution of\r\nmilitary problems, to provide a valid guide for the determination of\r\neffective operations, in detail. This guide may be used on occasions\r\nwhen, the correct objective having been selected, the only remaining\r\nproblem is to work out the detailed operations involved.\r\n\r\nThe Fundamental Military Principle, developed in the preceding\r\nchapter, has been formulated to fulfill the requirements described in\r\nthe preceding paragraph. Through the exhaustive analysis of the\r\nelements involved, there has been provided, in the form of a single\r\nfundamental principle, a valid guide for the selection of correct\r\nmilitary objectives and for the due determination of effective\r\noperations for their attainment.\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter, the abstract application of the Principle is\r\ndiscussed in terms of fundamental considerations. Section II of the\r\nchapter deals with the selection of objectives; this subject, in more\r\nspecific terms, is later expanded in Chapter VI. Section III of the\r\npresent chapter deals with the determination of operations; this\r\nsubject, in more specific terms, is expanded in Chapter VII. The\r\npresent chapter affords a treatment applicable to military problems of\r\nany nature. Later expansion is applicable, more especially, to naval\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement of the subject matter has been adopted for two\r\nreasons. First, discussion of fundamental considerations, thus taken\r\nup at the present point, immediately follows the formulation of the\r\nprinciple (in Chapter III). Furthermore, a fundamental treatment,\r\nprior to Chapters VI and VII, permits maximum brevity in the\r\ndiscussion, therein. The commander, having mastered the fundamentals\r\ndealt with here, can later follow the detailed procedure with minimum\r\ndistraction due to reference to the preceding discussion.\r\n\r\nEssential Elements Involved. As previously stated, the problems of war\r\ndiffer from those of other human activities with respect, only (page\r\n35), to the specialized character of the factors that enter.\r\n\r\nThe final outcome is dependent (page 8) on ability to isolate, occupy,\r\nor otherwise control the territory of the enemy. The sea, though it\r\nsupplements the resources of land areas, is destitute of many\r\nessential requirements of man, and affords no basis, alone, for the\r\nsecure development of human activities. Land is the natural habitat of\r\nman. The sea provides routes of communication between land areas. The\r\nair affords routes of communication over both land and sea.\r\n\r\nThese facts inject into military operations certain factors peculiar\r\nto movement of military forces by land, sea, and air (page 60). There\r\nare also involved the specialized demands of a technique for the\r\nimposition of and the resistance to physical violence. In addition\r\nthere appear those factors related to the psychology of human\r\nreactions to armed conflict.\r\n\r\nIn any situation involving opposing armed forces, the problem, as in\r\nany human activity (page 30), is, from the standpoint of each\r\nopponent, a matter of maintaining existing conditions or of bringing\r\nabout a change. The method employed, if the action is to be effective,\r\nwill follow lines calculated to shape the ensuing progressive changes\r\nin circumstances toward the attainment of the end in view. The action\r\nto be taken will be ineffective if it does not support the calculated\r\nline of endeavor, i.e., if it is not suitable or adequate forcibly to\r\nshape the course of events either toward the creation of a desired new\r\nand more favorable situation, or the maintenance of the original\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the principal components of a military problem--i.e.,\r\nthe military objectives and the military operations appropriate to the\r\neffort for their attainment--therefore requires a study of such\r\nobjectives and operations in terms, respectively, of a favorable\r\nmilitary situation (page 37) and of a favorably progressing military\r\noperation (page 38). As has been observed, the salient features of\r\nsuch a situation or operation are, from the abstract viewpoint,\r\nidentical, as are also the factors which determine the character of\r\nsuch features (page 39). As a covering word for such features and\r\nfactors, alike, the term \"elements\" appears especially suitable,\r\ninasmuch as it properly comprises the constituent parts of any\r\nsubject, as well as the factors which may pertain thereto.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the analysis, following, of the procedure for selection\r\nof correct military objectives is made in terms of the essential\r\nelements of a favorable military situation. For like reasons, the\r\nanalysis of the procedure for determining the character of the\r\ndetailed operations required is made in terms of the essential\r\nelements of a favorably progressing military operation. (For these\r\nelements, see the salient features and the factors cited in the\r\nFundamental Military Principle, page 41.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SELECTION OF CORRECT MILITARY OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nNature of Military Objectives. In the previous discussion (page 36),\r\nthe military objective has been defined as the end toward which action\r\nis being, or is to be, directed. As such it has been noted as an\r\nobjective in mind. The tangible focus of effort, the physical\r\nobjective toward which the action is directed, has been observed to be\r\nan objective in space. The physical objective is always an object, be\r\nit only a geographical point, while the objective, being a mental\r\nconcept, is a situation to be created or maintained.\r\n\r\nThe term \"objective\" requires circumspection, not only in the manner\r\nof its expression (see page 53), but in its use. The latter is true\r\nbecause the purport of the objective under consideration will vary\r\nwith the viewpoint of the echelon concerned. For instance, the proper\r\nvisualization of an objective, as an \"effect desired\" (page 19), calls\r\nfor a correct answer to the question, \"Who desires this effect to be\r\nproduced?\" (See page 4).\r\n\r\nA variety of viewpoints is thus a natural characteristic of the chain\r\nof command (pages 11-13), whose functioning creates what may be called\r\na \"chain of objectives\".\r\n\r\nNecessary exceptions aside, the commander expects to receive, from his\r\nimmediate superior, an assigned objective, which that superior thus\r\nenjoins the commander to attain. The commander, in turn, through the\r\nuse of the natural mental processes already explained, decides on an\r\nobjective, for the general effort of his own force, to attain the\r\nobjective assigned by his immediate superior.\r\n\r\nAs a subordinate, a commander to whom an objective has been assigned\r\nis responsible to his immediate superior for its attainment. The\r\ncommander may, however, also occupy the position of an immediate\r\nsuperior to one or more commanders on the next lower echelon. In such\r\ncapacity, he may assign objectives to these immediate subordinates. By\r\nattaining such an assigned objective, each of these subordinates thus\r\ncontributes to the success of the complete effort planned by his\r\nimmediate superior, to the extent represented by his own assigned\r\nshare of the effort.\r\n\r\nA commander can scarcely expect to receive in full the intelligent\r\nsupport of his subordinate commanders, unless he makes clear to them\r\nthe character of his own planned effort. It is customary, therefore,\r\nwhen assigning an objective to a subordinate, also to inform him of\r\nthe purpose which its attainment is intended to further. Stated\r\ndifferently, a commander, when imposing upon an immediate subordinate\r\nan effect which he is to produce, informs him, at the same time, of\r\nthe nature of the military result which he, the immediate superior,\r\nhas determined to bring about.\r\n\r\nThis is the part of wisdom, not merely of choice. It acquaints the\r\nimmediate subordinate with the objective of the immediate superior and\r\nthus enables the former to comprehend wherein the attainment of his\r\nown assigned objective is expected to contribute to the attainment of\r\nthe effect desired by his superior.\r\n\r\nSince the attainment of the assigned objectives will represent the\r\nconsummation of the general plan of the immediate superior, the\r\npurpose of each of these assignments is to assist in the attainment of\r\nthe objective announced, for his entire force, by the immediate\r\nsuperior (see also page 12).\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of the subordinate, the objective thus assigned by\r\nthe immediate superior becomes the appropriate effect desired,\r\nessential to the determination of the accomplishment which the former\r\nis to effect by his own effort. On occasion, also, the full scope of\r\nthe appropriate effect desired may require consideration of the\r\nobjectives of higher echelons in the chain of command, so far as such\r\nobjectives may be known or deduced.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of the immediate superior, in the matter of\r\nensuring that his immediate subordinates understand the purpose of\r\ntheir assigned objectives, is in no respect less than that which falls\r\nupon these subordinates in the execution of their own assignments. By\r\nfailing to provide subordinate commanders, through whatever methods,\r\nwith a knowledge not only of the details of his plan but of the\r\ngeneral objective which their integrated effort is calculated to\r\nattain, the superior may actually subject his undertaking to the risk\r\nof failure.\r\n\r\nThe decision as to the general plan (page 44) for the attainment of\r\nhis assigned objective provides the commander with an objective which\r\nhe himself has originated. With the plan for the attainment of his\r\ngeneral objective clearly fixed in mind, the commander may now proceed\r\nto the selection of one or more objectives of a specific nature, the\r\nintegrated attainment of which will ensure the attainment of his\r\nassigned objective. The instructions which he may then give,\r\nseverally, to his immediate subordinates in a detailed plan of\r\noperations, thus indicate to the latter their assigned objectives.\r\n(See also page 22.)\r\n\r\nThe source of the incentive (page 44) has an intimate connection with\r\nthe assigned objective. Furthermore, whatever the origin of the\r\nincentive, the ability to select correct objectives is an essential\r\nelement in the mental equipment of the commander.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the incentive arises by reason of a directive received\r\nfrom higher authority, such directive will presumably assign an\r\nobjective, specific or inferred. The commander to whom such an\r\nobjective is assigned is responsible for a correct understanding of\r\nall the implications involved, including the relationship between the\r\nassigned objective and the general objective of the next higher\r\ncommander, which represents the purpose of the assigned objective. On\r\noccasion it will also be necessary for the commander to consider the\r\nrelationships involved with the further objectives of the higher\r\ncommand (page 49). Again, without any suggestion of cavilling at\r\norders received, the commander may also find occasion to examine, with\r\ncare, the implications of his assigned objective, because of his\r\nresponsibility for taking correct action in the premises (page 15).\r\n\r\nIf the incentive arises from a decision previously made by the\r\ncommander, it follows that such decision will have embodied an\r\nobjective, selected by the commander himself.\r\n\r\nIf the incentive arises because of the demands of the situation, the\r\ncommander is responsible for recognition of the necessity for action\r\nand for the correct selection of an appropriate objective, to be\r\nadopted by him as a basis for his own action as if it were assigned by\r\nhigher authority.\r\n\r\nAn assigned objective having been established with respect to the\r\nbasis for his problem, the commander is always responsible for the\r\ncorrect selection of an objective to serve as the end in view for the\r\ngeneral, integrated action of his subordinate commanders.\r\n\r\nOnce such an objective has been selected, the commander is further\r\nresponsible for selecting, on the basis provided thereby, correct\r\nobjectives to be assigned to his subordinate commanders.\r\n\r\nFor various practical reasons, therefore, the responsibility of the\r\ncommander requires of him the ability to select correct objectives. On\r\nthe basis of classification with respect to the authority making the\r\nselection, analysis will demonstrate the existence of two types of\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\nThese two types of objectives are (see page 30 as to effects and\r\nfurther effects), namely, (1) the assigned objective (page 48)\r\nordinarily indicated by higher authority, exceptionally determined by\r\nthe commander for himself, and (2) the objective typically selected by\r\nthe commander, himself, as the end in view for the integrated effort\r\nof his subordinates. It will be noted that in the latter category\r\nthere will fall, not only the general objective referred to\r\nimmediately above, but numerous other objectives for whose attainment\r\nprovision may be needed during the actual prosecution of the effort or\r\nin anticipation thereof.\r\n\r\nProcedure for Selection of Correct Military Objectives. The\r\nFundamental Military Principle (page 41), properly applied, is the\r\nbasis for the selection of any or all of such objectives. The\r\nprocedure involves the direct application of the corollary Principle\r\nof the Correct Military Objective.\r\n\r\nAccording to this principle, the selection of a correct military\r\nobjective depends on due consideration of the salient features noted,\r\ni.e., correct physical objectives, advantageous relative positions,\r\nproper apportionment of fighting strength, and provision for adequate\r\nfreedom of action. These features, discussed in greater detail\r\nhereafter (in this chapter), are determined by factors cited in the\r\nPrinciple (pages 41-42).\r\n\r\nThe first factor being the appropriate effect desired, a correct\r\nmilitary objective is selected, in the first instance, by reference to\r\nthe requirement of suitability as to this factor. This appropriate\r\neffect desired may be indicated by the higher command (page 44), or\r\nmay be determined by the commander himself as hereinafter explained\r\n(page 52).\r\n\r\nWhen the appropriate effect desired has been established, the next\r\nconsideration is, \"What physical objective (or objectives) can be\r\nfound, action with relation to which will, if successful, attain this\r\neffect?\"\r\n\r\nFor example, if the appropriate effect desired were the \"reduction of\r\nenemy battleship strength\" in a certain area, then an enemy battleship\r\nappearing therein would manifestly be a correct physical objective. A\r\nsuitable action with relation thereto would be \"to destroy the enemy\r\nbattleship\", in which case the objective involved in the action would\r\nbe \"the destruction of the enemy battleship\".\r\n\r\nAny lesser accomplishment, such as infliction of damage on the enemy\r\nbattleship, or its repulse, or its diversion elsewhere, would also be\r\nsuitable to the appropriate effect desired, though not in the same\r\ndegree. Each such visualized accomplishment, suitable to the\r\nappropriate effect desired, may properly be considered as a\r\ntentatively selected objective.\r\n\r\nAn objective having been tentatively selected on the basis of the\r\nappropriate effect desired, its final selection will naturally depend,\r\nas indicated in the Principle, on the feasibility of the effort\r\ninvolved in the attainment of each such objective, and on the\r\nacceptability of the consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\nIn investigating such feasibility, account is taken of the relative\r\nfighting strength. With relation to the enemy battleship, for example\r\n(see above), the commander would consider the means available to him\r\nand the means opposed (including the enemy battleship and any\r\nsupporting forces), as influenced by the characteristics of the\r\ntheater.\r\n\r\nThis investigation will include, necessarily, a sufficient analysis of\r\nthe salient features of the operation required to attain each\r\nobjective. Such features include the nature of the physical objectives\r\n(the battleship and any other forces, for instance), the possibilities\r\nof relative position, the problems involved in apportioning the forces\r\non either side, and the proper considerations as to freedom of action.\r\n\r\nA similar study with respect to the acceptability of the consequences\r\nto be expected, as to the costs involved in the operation, will\r\nprovide a basis for a conclusion as to that factor.\r\n\r\nIf the attainment of an objective is found to be infeasible, or\r\nfeasible only at the expense of unacceptable consequences, the\r\nproposed objective will naturally be rejected, and some other\r\nobjective will be considered (page 33).\r\n\r\nThe objective finally adopted as the best will be that which, all\r\nthings considered, is best adapted to the requirements of suitability,\r\nfeasibility, and acceptability, as outlined in the Fundamental\r\nMilitary Principle.\r\n\r\nThe Appropriate Effect Desired, as the Basis for the Objective. As\r\nwill be appreciated from the foregoing discussion, the first factor in\r\nthe selection of a correct objective is the \"appropriate effect\r\ndesired\". The evaluation of this factor is not always easy, for\r\nreasons which will be explained.\r\n\r\nThe procedure (as indicated by the Principle of the Appropriate Effect\r\nto be Desired--page 33) is the same as for the selection of an\r\nobjective. This identity of procedure is natural, because the\r\nappropriate effect desired, used as a basis for selecting the\r\ncommander's general objective, itself involves the appreciation of an\r\nobjective. The latter is, in fact, one of the \"chain of objectives\"\r\npreviously mentioned (page 48).\r\n\r\nUnder conventional conditions this objective is selected by higher\r\nauthority, and is assigned to the commander in his instructions from\r\nthe next higher echelon (page 48). The objective so indicated will of\r\ncourse, under sound procedure, have been selected by higher authority\r\non the basis embodied in the Fundamental Military Principle.\r\n\r\nWhen an established chain of command (page 11) is in effective\r\noperation, the path to the appropriate effect desired will therefore\r\nnormally be indicated through an assigned objective, by the immediate\r\nsuperior. This assignment, however, or the failure to receive such an\r\nindication, does not relieve the commander from the responsibility for\r\ntaking correct action on his own initiative. Such necessity may arise\r\nshould he find, in the exercise of a sound discretion, that his\r\ninstructions need modification or alteration, or even that it is\r\nnecessary for him to depart from his instructions under circumstances\r\nof great emergency (page 15-16).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the objective may be adopted by (rather than assigned to)\r\nthe commander concerned, on his own initiative, in order to meet the\r\ndemands of a situation (page 50) as to which the higher command has\r\nnot yet had time or opportunity to act.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even when an objective is assigned by higher authority in\r\nthe usual course, it may be expressed in such terms as to require\r\nexamination in order to enable the commander to appreciate it (page\r\n43), as to its bearing on his operations. In fact, studious analysis\r\nmay be necessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the objective so indicated does not specify a\r\nclearly-defined goal, the commander will need to make a thorough study\r\nin order to appreciate the full implications intended. He may find it\r\nnecessary to analyze his immediate superior's instructions pertaining\r\nto the entire force of which his command is a part, and to consider,\r\nalso, the objectives indicated for other commanders, on his own\r\nechelon, who also belong to that force.\r\n\r\nOn occasion, also, higher authority may acquaint the commander with\r\nthe general plan adopted by the superior, and may order action--such\r\nas movement in a certain direction or to a certain locality--without\r\nassigning a more definite objective. Should it happen in emergency\r\nthat later developments prevent higher authority from making such an\r\nassignment, the commander may find himself under the necessity of\r\nselecting, for himself, an appropriate objective, to be adopted by him\r\nas if it were assigned.\r\n\r\nShould the commander find that his instructions do not clearly\r\nindicate an objective, or should he find that the one indicated is not\r\napplicable under the circumstances of the case, he will select an\r\nappropriate objective for his own guidance as if it were assigned by\r\nhigher authority. He will make such selection through use of the same\r\nprocedure already described herein as applicable to the selection of\r\nan objective of any sort. In such case he puts himself in his\r\nsuperior's place, in order to arrive at a reasoned conclusion such as\r\nthe higher commander, if apprised of the circumstances, would desire\r\nto adopt. Circumstances permitting, the commander will of course\r\ncommunicate with higher authority, and will make constructive\r\nrepresentations. (See page 15.)\r\n\r\nThe appropriate effect desired, as the first factor to be applied in\r\nselecting such an objective, will naturally involve the objective\r\nindicated in the general plan for the immediate superior's entire\r\nforce. This general plan is normally announced by the superior for the\r\nguidance of the commander and of other commanders on the same echelon.\r\nIf, however, this further objective is not known to the commander, he\r\nwill endeavor to obtain a proper point of reference. To this end, he\r\nwill use his knowledge of the objective assigned to his immediate\r\nsuperior, or of the further intentions of the higher command with\r\nrespect to the conduct of the operations, or of the campaign, or of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nThe provisions for the formulation of plans and orders (Chapters VII\r\nand VIII) take account of the fact that the commander may require\r\ndefinite information as to the objectives of higher echelons. In\r\norganizations where a state of mutual understanding has been well\r\nestablished, the commander will rarely be without some guidance in the\r\npremises (see also page 33), by reason of the chain of objectives\r\nindicated in plans and orders of the higher command (page 48).\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of the commander, this relationship among\r\nobjectives presents to him a series, from the present or immediate\r\nobjective to others more distant in time. Thus there may be one or\r\nmore intermediate objectives, leading away from the immediate one to\r\nthe ultimate objective, so far as the concern of the moment is\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThis relationship of immediate, intermediate, and ultimate objectives\r\nmay also exist in situations where the commander, operating on his own\r\ninitiative and responsibility, determines such a chain of objectives\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation frequently arises in a campaign or a major operation,\r\nand is normal, also, as to minor operations (see page 56, as to\r\nphysical objectives).\r\n\r\nAs already observed, the relationship of objective and further\r\nobjective is the criterion for distinguishing between strategical and\r\ntactical considerations, from the viewpoint of the commander concerned\r\n(pages 9 and 10).\r\n\r\nWhat has been noted in the foregoing as to the objective (singular) is\r\nalso applicable to situations where such an objective involves two or\r\nmore objectives collectively considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE MILITARY OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nAs noted with respect to the Fundamental Military Principle (page 41),\r\nthe effort required for the attainment of a military objective\r\ninvolves military operations (page 37), whose salient features are\r\nlisted in the Principle. These features, including physical\r\nobjectives, relative positions, apportionment of fighting strength,\r\nand freedom of action, will now be discussed to indicate how they are\r\ncorrectly determined by the factors, also cited in the Principle,\r\npertaining to suitability, feasibility, and acceptability. Such\r\ndetermination is accomplished through application of the corollary\r\nPrinciple of Effective Military Operations (page 42).\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Objectives\r\n\r\nFundamental Considerations. An operation, however splendidly conceived\r\nand faultlessly executed, involves waste of effort if directed with\r\nrelation to wrong physical objectives.\r\n\r\nSince a physical objective constitutes the tangible focus of effort\r\n(page 47) toward the attainment of the effect desired, its correct\r\ndetermination is of paramount importance both before and during the\r\nprosecution of operations.\r\n\r\nAs has been demonstrated (page 51), the consideration of possible\r\nphysical objectives (in space) is essential to the selection of\r\nsuitable objectives (in mind). Moreover, action with reference to one\r\nor more physical objectives is the necessary basis for determining the\r\nfeasibility and acceptability of a plan.\r\n\r\nMilitary objectives can be achieved only through the application of\r\npower, actually or by threat (page 8), with reference to physical\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\nThe determination of correct physical objectives is followed, if more\r\nthan one such objective is found, by the selection of the one or more\r\nwhich are best adapted to the requirements of the situation. The\r\nprocedure for determination and for selection is a matter for\r\npainstaking mental effort, based on the considerations now to be\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe term \"military objective\" is frequently used in military\r\nliterature to distinguish physical objectives which are combatant in\r\ncharacter from those which are noncombatant. The considerations which\r\nfollow are applicable to physical objectives of all categories.\r\n\r\nProcedure for Determination and Selection of Correct Physical\r\nObjectives. In a particular set of circumstances, the field wherein\r\ncorrect physical objectives may be found and the best selected, is\r\nthat of an existent or probable theater of action.\r\n\r\nThe determination of a physical objective, when correct, initially\r\nsatisfies the requirement of suitability with respect to the nature of\r\nthe objective,--this being, in such case, the appropriate effect\r\ndesired (page 31). Physical objectives not suitable, with relation to\r\nthe objective to be attained, are manifestly incorrect physical points\r\nof orientation with respect to the operations involved in the effort\r\nto attain such an objective.\r\n\r\nIt may be found, however, that the selection of a single physical\r\nobjective will not fulfill this requirement. A commander may find it\r\nnecessary to direct his effort simultaneously, or in succession, with\r\nrelation to more than one physical objective.\r\n\r\nWhen a succession of physical objectives has to be dealt with, the\r\nselection will necessarily include such a series. Such a case might\r\noccur where a campaign has been found necessary in the form of\r\nsuccessive stages as essential features. The visualized termination of\r\neach successive stage may be marked by the successful application of\r\neffort with respect to one or more physical objectives. Such a series\r\nof physical objectives may frequently also occur in operations on a\r\nsmaller scale; even in very minor actions such a succession of efforts\r\nis normal. (See page 54, as to objectives.)\r\n\r\nThe choice as to the specific nature of physical objectives will\r\nextend, for example, from the enemy's organized forces as a whole to\r\nthe physical body of an individual combatant. Within this range will\r\nbe included all manner of physical elements of enemy fighting\r\nstrength, singly and in combination, such as troops, ships,\r\ngeographical points, lines and areas, fortifications, bases, and\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe physical objective may take the form of a fixed geographical\r\nposition, the occupation of which, because of its inherent\r\nadvantages, may be, for example, an essential preliminary to further\r\nprogress. The position may, for instance, be merely a point in the\r\nocean (page 47), a rendezvous beyond which, although its occupation\r\nmay be uncontested, it has been deemed unwise to proceed without\r\nfurther information or additional strength.\r\n\r\nThe physical objective, therefore, does not always take the form of\r\nsome element of the enemy fighting strength; not infrequently, the\r\noccupation of a correct physical objective may be uncontested by the\r\nenemy. However, intervening armed forces of the enemy may constitute\r\nthe physical objective for application of successful effort before a\r\nfurther physical objective may be dealt with. The possibility of enemy\r\nopposition may, therefore, place the selection of one or more physical\r\nobjectives on an indeterminable basis at the time of the original\r\nsolution of the problem. This may require a commander to defer his\r\nchoice until the situation has become more fully developed.\r\n\r\nFor example, his objective may be the occupation of a certain harbor,\r\npreliminary to the establishment of a base. The harbor is then a\r\ncorrect physical objective, perhaps the only physical objective which\r\nneed be dealt with, if there are no other obstacles to prevent or\r\ninterrupt the operation. Armed forces of the enemy may, however, stand\r\nas an obstacle to the undisputed occupation of the harbor and,\r\ntherefore, to the attainment of the objective. In such case they\r\nbecome, for the time being, the correct physical objective.\r\n\r\nWhile the armed forces of the enemy may frequently present appropriate\r\nphysical objectives, this is not always the case (see above). It is\r\ntrue that, in war, the armed forces of the enemy, until they can no\r\nlonger offer effective resistance, prevent the full attainment of the\r\nobjective of the State. Accordingly, from the broad viewpoint, they\r\nmay constitute the legitimate and proper physical objective of the\r\nopposing armed forces. Armed forces of the enemy which are present in\r\nopposition to any projected operations are likely to offer proper\r\nphysical objectives.\r\n\r\nThese facts, however, do not restrict a commander, in his choice of a\r\nphysical objective, to the armed forces of the enemy. Nor do these\r\nconsiderations require him to search for and destroy the enemy forces\r\nbefore directing his effort toward the attainment of an objective\r\nunder circumstances where the enemy is seen to be incapable of\r\npresenting effective opposition.\r\n\r\nThe correct physical objective may change several times during the\r\ncourse of an operation. This is particularly to be expected in a naval\r\ntactical engagement of considerable scope. While the enemy fleet, as a\r\nwhole, may properly be considered in such a case to be the physical\r\nobjective, the component parts of each fleet, the types of vessels and\r\ntheir combinations, may, from time to time, find in their opponents a\r\nvariety of physical objectives, the particular identity of which can\r\nscarcely be predicted with assurance. It is here that the importance\r\nof the correct selection of physical objectives stands out in bold\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nInfliction of loss on enemy forces, or support of own forces hard\r\npressed, may always seem tempting immediate objectives in war.\r\nHowever, there may be occasions when disengagement or refusal to\r\nengage an enemy force, even though it be of manifestly inferior\r\nstrength, may be appropriate to the attainment of the end in view.\r\nNecessity for speed or secrecy, or other demands, may make the\r\nrequired operations unacceptable. (See page 75 as to the offensive and\r\nthe defensive.)\r\n\r\nLand, as the natural habitat of man (page 46), is always the principal\r\nstore-house of his indispensable resources, as well as the primary\r\nscene of his activities. Naval operations, therefore, have always in\r\nview the eventual maintenance or creation of a favorable military\r\nsituation in critical land areas. From this fundamental viewpoint, the\r\neventual physical objective of military operations is always a land\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe suitability of a physical objective having been determined, the\r\nnext consideration is the feasibility (page 31) of taking such action,\r\nwith relation thereto, as will, if successful, attain the objective in\r\nmind. Feasibility is determined by evaluation of the factors of means\r\navailable and opposed, as influenced by the characteristics of the\r\ntheater, in order to assess relative fighting strength (see page 52).\r\nIn connection with the effort involved with relation to any physical\r\nobjective, questions of feasibility may make it desirable or necessary\r\nto visualize the detailed operations which arise from considerations\r\nof relative position, of apportionment of fighting strength, and of\r\nprovision for freedom of action.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest with respect to such operations, it is noted\r\nthat the premature disclosure of a selected physical objective is a\r\nmilitary error. By appearing, however, to operate against more than\r\none physical objective, a commander may lead the enemy to overstrain\r\nhis resources in the effort to protect them all. Thus the commander\r\nmay reduce the resistance to be encountered in dealing with what have\r\nalready, or may finally, become the selected physical objectives.\r\nFeints in several directions may even divert all of the enemy's\r\neffective defense from the vital points (see also page 68).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the suitability of a physical objective has been established, as\r\nwell as the feasibility of the contemplated action with relation\r\nthereto, such action is next considered from the standpoint of\r\nacceptability with reference to the consequences as to costs. The\r\nspecific factors involved in acceptability as to consequences have\r\npreviously been mentioned (page 31).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the requirements of suitability, feasibility, and acceptability\r\nhave been satisfied, the locality, the opposing force, or other\r\nsubject of consideration may be regarded as a correct physical\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\nWhen more than one correct physical objective has been determined and\r\na choice is indicated, such selection will also be founded on the\r\nforegoing requirements.\r\n\r\nNo doctrine, no advance instructions, can replace the responsible\r\njudgment of a commander as to his correct physical objectives. On\r\noccasion, higher authority may request recommendations (see page 42,\r\nas to opinions) with respect to such objectives. The duty of a\r\ncommander to depart from his instructions under certain conditions,\r\nand the grave responsibility which he thereby assumes, have also been\r\nreferred to (page 16).\r\n\r\n\r\nRelative Positions\r\n\r\nFundamental Considerations. The relative positions occupied or\r\nsusceptible of occupancy by armed forces are matters which demand\r\nconstant and intelligent attention before and during hostilities.\r\nBeing fruitful sources of advantage or disadvantage, such relative\r\npositions assume primary importance where enemy forces are concerned,\r\nand are scarcely of less importance from the standpoint of the correct\r\napportionment of the subdivisions of one's own forces, and from the\r\nviewpoint of their freedom of action.\r\n\r\nDuring periods of actual tactical contact, the successful delivery of\r\nthe decisive thrust against selected physical objectives is greatly\r\nfurthered by the occupancy and maintenance of advantageous relative\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental significance of relative position lies in the fact\r\nthat position is the basis of movement, for movement is merely a\r\nchange of position. Speed is the rate at which movement takes place.\r\nThe particular factors to be reckoned with are, therefore, time and\r\nspace. In skillful utilization of these elements lies the successful\r\nemployment of relative position in the creation or maintenance of a\r\nfavorable military situation, whether the movement be by land, sea, or\r\nair (page 46).\r\n\r\nThe necessity for movement may be an important consideration in\r\ndetermining possible or likely theaters of operations. Where\r\ntransportation between two or more positions within a certain area is\r\nessential to the successful conduct of a war, the area which includes\r\nthe routes between these positions, or a portion of such routes,\r\nbecomes at once a possible or likely theater. Such an area may be\r\nnormally within the control of one or the other of the belligerents,\r\nor the control may be in dispute. Certain of the positions themselves\r\nmay belong to neither of the belligerents. The area itself may be a\r\nland area, or a sea area, or a combination of the two. It may be an\r\narea which borders upon the sea, or an island area. In any case, the\r\nair is a common characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe movement of a force is properly regarded, not as an even flow, but\r\nas a series of steps from one position to another. The movement may or\r\nmay not be continuous. Pauses are usual, their occurrence and duration\r\nbeing a matter dependent upon circumstances and calling for the\r\nexercise of sound professional judgment. Intermediate positions may be\r\nutilized, successively, so as to facilitate occupancy of the final\r\nposition which is the goal of that phase of operations (page 56). This\r\nprocedure often effects an ultimate saving of time. In many cases,\r\nother advantages also may accrue.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations are applicable to changes of position\r\nwhether in the direction of the enemy, toward a flank, or to the rear.\r\nFlanking maneuvers and retrograde movements, both sometimes profitably\r\nemployed to decoy the enemy, may frequently be utilized to gain\r\nadvantageous relative position. The proper objective of each is the\r\nmaintenance of a favorable situation, or the alteration of an\r\nunfavorable one, either locally or with reference to the larger phases\r\nof operations, through measures involving apportionment of fighting\r\nstrength, or obtaining advantages of position, or retaining or gaining\r\nfreedom of action. Combinations of forward, flanking, or retrograde\r\nmovements are frequent in war, the skillful combination of the\r\noffensive and the defensive (see page 75) being no less applicable to\r\nthe problem of relative position than to the other elements of a\r\nfavorable military operation.\r\n\r\nProcedure for Determination and Selection of Advantageous Relative\r\nPositions. Since the various positions to be occupied become physical\r\nobjectives for the time being, their proper determination and\r\nselection are governed by the same considerations which apply to\r\nphysical objectives (see page 55 and following).\r\n\r\nThus, it becomes necessary to consider, first, as to suitability,\r\nwhether the position, once gained, will permit the attainment of the\r\nappropriate effect desired.\r\n\r\nSecondly, consideration is required as to feasibility. Are the\r\navailable means adequate to gain or to maintain such position? In\r\nanswering this question, due regard is paid to opposing means and to\r\nthe characteristics of the theater.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is to be considered, as to acceptability, whether the\r\nconsequences as to costs, in terms of relative fighting strength, will\r\nbe such, if the position is gained or maintained, as to permit the\r\nattainment of the objective. The possible effect of these consequences\r\non future action, whether the attempt succeeds or fails, may be\r\nvitally significant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith regard to suitability, the factor of the appropriate effect\r\ndesired calls for special consideration of the requirements with a\r\nview to future action. This is true because of the relationship which\r\nnaturally exists between successive positions (page 60) if changes of\r\nlocation from one to another are to be integrated into movement\r\ncalculated to accomplish the effect desired. Each position, itself for\r\nthe time being a physical objective, offers certain advantages or\r\ninvolves certain disadvantages with relation to a further physical\r\nobjective. The position of the latter, in turn, presents possibilities\r\n(or denies them) with respect to future movement. The influence of\r\nconsiderations with respect to time (in addition to those noted above\r\nwith regard to space) is also a factor whose importance increases when\r\nurgency is a matter of immediate concern.\r\n\r\nWith regard to feasibility, the technical capabilities and\r\nlimitations of the armed forces (page 67) are, of course, among the\r\nprincipal factors. These capabilities and limitations are respectively\r\npromoted and imposed primarily by considerations peculiar to the\r\nparticular medium of movement involved.\r\n\r\nWith specific regard to the areas within which military operations may\r\nsuitably be undertaken, the fundamental distinctions created by\r\nrecognized political sovereignty require attention. That part of the\r\nsurface of the earth which comprises its land area is recognized as\r\nthe property or the charge of one or another of the sovereign states,\r\nalthough in certain cases the title may be in dispute. The air above a\r\nnation's territorial domain is generally understood to be part of that\r\ndomain. The point to be observed is that there are no land areas which\r\nbelong equally to all nations. Accordingly; because of the factor of\r\nneutral sovereignty, both land and air forces of belligerent States\r\nmay be under the necessity of following indirect routes to their\r\nphysical objectives.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the sea, however, all those portions of the earth's\r\nsurface which are covered by water (exclusive only of the recognized\r\nterritorial waters of the several nations), i.e., the high seas, are\r\npresumably common property. The same applies to the air above the sea.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, and the fact that the surface of the sea is a\r\nbroad plane, permit open sea areas to be traversed by a variety of\r\nroutes to an extent not applicable in the case of land areas and the\r\nair above them. In addition, the fact that technological developments\r\nhave been such as to permit movement, not only on the surface of the\r\nsea and through the air above but also beneath the surface, gives\r\ndistinctive characteristics to the sea when considered as a theater of\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the sea has, from the earliest days to the present,\r\nprovided roads over which human beings in greatest numbers and the\r\nresources of the world in greatest weight and volume can be\r\ntransported in single carriers. From the standpoint of any belligerent\r\nit is imperative that, during war, these roads be kept open to the\r\nextent demanded by the needs of the State. It is equally imperative\r\nthat an enemy be deprived of the advantage which their use might\r\notherwise afford. In both cases localized (even though temporary)\r\ncontrol, not only of the surface but of the water beneath and the air\r\nabove, may be essential. It is pertinent, also, to note at this point\r\nthe interest of neutrals, or of unneutral nonbelligerent Powers, in\r\nkeeping open the trade routes via the high seas. Such interest may\r\nconstitute an important factor in the calculations of a belligerent\r\nState.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of maximum capacity for speed represent the utmost\r\npossibilities with respect to movements (i.e., change of positions)\r\n(page 60) in a given medium within a given time limit. A knowledge of\r\nmaximum speed potentialities, one's own and those of the enemy, is\r\nrequired if changes in position are intelligently to be made. A\r\nknowledge of the variety of conditions, controllable and otherwise,\r\nwhich affect or preclude the employment of maximum speed, is likewise\r\na requisite. Poor material condition, inadequate training, and\r\nincorrect methods of operation are preventable or correctable. The\r\nlimitations on speed which are imposed by logistics, and by natural\r\nobstacles such as the hydrography, the climate, the wind, the weather,\r\nand the state of the sea, are susceptible of greatest possible\r\nadjustment to circumstances only by the exercise of foresight and\r\njudgment. All these conditions indicate the close relationship that\r\nexists between relative position and freedom of action (page 70).\r\n\r\nThe same observations apply to considerations of maximum capacity for\r\nendurance, the ability to operate without necessity for replenishment\r\nfrom an outside source. Radius of action is decreased or increased\r\naccordingly with resultant restrictions, or otherwise, on freedom of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the freedom of action of armed forces, also a\r\nconsideration in relation to feasibility, the logistics of a military\r\noperation, of whatever scope, constitutes a problem which begins when\r\nthe plan is in process of formulation. This problem ends only when the\r\nnecessity for sustaining the movement, and for retaining the position\r\ngained, no longer exists.\r\n\r\nShips and other means of conveyance, surface, subsurface, and air, are\r\nincapable of providing the necessities of life and the implements of\r\nwarfare beyond the capacity built into them. Operations which extend\r\nbeyond the limits of such capacity must cease unless replenishment and\r\nsupport, possible only from other sources, are provided. The logistics\r\nproblem may be so difficult as to cause rejection of a course of\r\naction involving distant operations. From the standpoint of supply,\r\nmilitary movements by land, sea, and air are, therefore, vitally\r\nassociated with positions on land and with their relation to the area\r\nof operations (see also page 58).\r\n\r\nThe same observations apply in larger scope to the State itself,\r\nwhich, because of economic vulnerability with respect to certain\r\nessential raw materials, may be compelled to seek support from outside\r\nsources lest supplies on hand become exhausted. In all cases, great\r\nimportance attaches to the geographical location of sources of supply\r\nin their relation to a required point of delivery and to the routes\r\nwhich lie between.\r\n\r\nIt follows that enemy sources of supply may be suitable physical\r\nobjectives (see page 56). Their destruction or capture, or the\r\nseverance of the enemy's lines of communication with them, may\r\nseriously restrict his freedom of action.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the relative position of its features, and\r\napart from their inherent military value, the characteristics of the\r\ntheater of military operations may exert an important influence upon\r\nthe shaping of events. Each characteristic merits consideration as a\r\npotential means of facilitating or obstructing movement. Some\r\nlocalities may have been developed as repair, supply, or air bases.\r\nOthers may be sources of essential raw materials. Certain points may\r\nbe heavily fortified. Island formations may be valuable to either\r\nopponent, or to both, because of the capacity and security of their\r\nharbors, the character of their terrain, or their positions relative\r\nto each other. The inherent military value of the several features of\r\nthe theater may be enhanced or vitiated by the relative position which\r\neach occupies with respect to other features, and with reference to\r\nthe location of the armed forces involved.\r\n\r\nSo-called \"strategic points\", historically significant in connection\r\nwith military operations, derive their importance by reason of their\r\nrelative position with reference to routes of movement.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of utilizing or of changing the characteristics of a\r\ntheater of operations, to assist, hamper, or deny movement, are\r\ngoverned by considerations previously discussed (see the Principle of\r\nthe Proper Physical Conditions to be established in the Field of\r\nAction--page 34).\r\n\r\nIn planning the creation or maintenance of a favorable military\r\nsituation from the standpoint of relative position, there may,\r\ntherefore, profitably be included an examination into:\r\n\r\n(a) The relation which may exist between the geographical location of\r\nthe subdivisions of one's own forces and\r\n\r\n      (1) Those of the enemy,\r\n\r\n      (2) Geographical areas under one's own control, and\r\n          positions within those areas,\r\n\r\n      (3) Geographical areas not under one's own control, and\r\n          positions within those areas,\r\n\r\n      (4) Areas coveted or in dispute,\r\n\r\n      (5) Fixed actual and potential repair and operating bases\r\n          and sources of supply and replenishment, own and enemy,\r\n          controlled or otherwise.\r\n\r\n(b) The relation existing among the geographical locations listed\r\nimmediately above, including the effect of possible changes in\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n(c) The bearing of the sun and moon, and the direction of the wind and\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n(d) The length and vulnerability of possible lines of communication.\r\n\r\n(e) The time and distance, and resulting relative speeds, involved in\r\nmovements necessary to change or to maintain an existing relation.\r\n\r\n(f) The measures incident to adequate freedom of action.\r\n\r\nA more detailed analysis of the factors influencing relative position\r\nis made in Section I-B of the Estimate Form (Chapter VI).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn connection with the factor of consequences as to costs, the\r\nrequirement as to acceptability is a weighing of expected gains and of\r\nreasonably anticipated losses, a balancing of the one against the\r\nother, with due attention to the demands of future action, (see page\r\n61).\r\n\r\nMilitary movement normally involves an inescapable expenditure of\r\nmilitary resources. The characteristics of the theater, alone, will\r\nexact their due toll, even if no enemy be present. In the presence of\r\nthe enemy, such expenditures may increase with great rapidity. The\r\nfundamental consideration here is whether the resultant losses are\r\ndisproportionate to the gains.\r\n\r\nAvoidance of movement is frequently the correct decision, because\r\nmovement, if it offers no advantages, is scarcely justifiable even if\r\nit entails no material loss. Movement, merely for the sake of moving,\r\nis not a profitable military operation. However, the conduct of\r\nmilitary operations without major movement is a concept inherently\r\ndefensive (page 75), even apathetic, whose outcome, against an\r\nenergetic enemy, can rarely be other than defeat. In the execution of\r\nadvantageous movement to achieve correct military objectives, the\r\ncompetent commander is always ready to accept the losses which are\r\ninseparable from his gains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations as to advantageous relative positions are\r\napplicable, not only in the realm of the commander's decisions as to\r\nhis own action, but also to his judgments rendered when higher\r\nauthority calls for recommendations (see page 42).\r\n\r\n\r\nApportionment of Fighting Strength\r\n\r\nFundamental Considerations. The assignment of a task may be expected\r\nto carry with it availability of fighting strength deemed adequate by\r\nhigher authority for accomplishment of the operation involved.\r\n\r\nIn appropriate instances, the higher command may call for\r\nrecommendations as to the amount and character of the means deemed\r\nadequate by the subordinate for performance of the task with which he\r\nis, or is to be, charged (page 42).\r\n\r\nIn any case, means having been made available, it remains for a\r\ncommander to whom an objective has been assigned to apportion these\r\navailable resources in such manner as to provide the requisite\r\nstrength at points likely to be decisive, without unduly weakening\r\nother points. In effect, he is charged with a practical adjustment of\r\nmeans to ends. This responsibility is discharged by the effective\r\nutilization of means and prevention of waste nicely balanced through\r\nfull consideration of all essential elements of a favorable military\r\noperation. The procedure involved has been indicated (see the\r\ncorollary Principle for the determination of the Proper Means to be\r\nMade Available--page 34).\r\n\r\nThe relation between the strength to be brought to bear in dealing\r\nwith a selected physical objective, the tactical concern of the\r\nmoment, and that necessary to the attainment of the strategical aim\r\n(see pages 9 and 10), constitutes a fundamental consideration in\r\neffecting such a balance.\r\n\r\nIn making a correct apportionment, there will be involved not only the\r\nphysical elements of fighting strength, but the mental and moral as\r\nwell. With respect to mental and moral factors, the capabilities of\r\nparticular commanders and organizations may be an important factor in\r\napportioning forces to tasks. In the physical field, numbers and types\r\noccupy a prominent position, each however, requiring consideration\r\nfrom the standpoint of the existing situation.\r\n\r\nThus, forces composed of appropriate types and suitably equipped and\r\ntrained may exercise greater effect than numerically larger forces not\r\nso well adjusted to the requirements of the situation. On the other\r\nhand, numerical considerations become predominant under conditions\r\notherwise substantially equal.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, viewed in the light of the relationship of naval\r\noperations to land areas (page 63), indicate the importance which may\r\nattach to immediate availability, with a naval force, in addition to\r\nits own air strength, of a proper complement of land forces (with\r\nappropriate air strength) which are organized, equipped, and trained\r\nfor amphibious operations.\r\n\r\nThe same considerations point also to the vital importance of due\r\nprovision, with respect to the armed forces of a State, for joint\r\noperations involving concerted action on land, by sea, or in the air.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the capabilities of particular commanders (page\r\n66), it will be appreciated how important it is, more especially in\r\namphibious or joint operations, for responsible officers to have a\r\ncorrect understanding of the powers and limitations of the several\r\ntypes of military forces involved, be their primary medium of movement\r\nthe land, the sea, or the air.\r\n\r\nFactors of dispersion and concentration are also involved in\r\napportionment of fighting strength.\r\n\r\nWhile undue dispersion may result in lack of adequate fighting\r\nstrength where required, a certain degree of dispersion may be\r\nnecessary to meet the demands of movement and of freedom of action.\r\nSerious errors in this regard, however, may result in inability to\r\nfurnish support where needed, and in consequent punishment or\r\nisolation of one or more valuable detachments.\r\n\r\nIn distant operations some dispersion is required to safeguard long\r\nlines of communication. The requirements for this purpose may\r\nsometimes be so great that, unless the total available strength is\r\nadequate, a due apportionment to the guarding of long lines of\r\ncommunication may so weaken the main force as to prevent the\r\nattainment of the objective. (See also page 63.)\r\n\r\nProper dispersion is, therefore, a requirement to be met, while undue\r\ndispersion is to be avoided. But realization is also necessary, in\r\nthis connection, that there is an equal danger in over-concentration.\r\nAn undue concentration of means at any point may subject such a force\r\nto unnecessary loss. Another disadvantage may be lack of adequate\r\nfighting strength elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, axiomatic advice that it is unwise to divide a total\r\nforce, while containing a sound element of caution, is misleading and\r\ninadequate, for division is often necessary or desirable. To be\r\nadequate, a maxim or rule relating to division of force should\r\nindicate when, and in what measure, such division may or may not be\r\nnecessary or desirable. (See also page 25.)\r\n\r\nSimilarly inadequate, however true as a generality, is the statement\r\nthat the requirements of effective warfare are met by bringing\r\nsuperiority to bear at the decisive time and place. Such an injunction\r\nis of little assistance in solving practical problems as to the\r\nappropriate degree of superiority, and as to the proper time and\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, any rule is faulty which advises a commander to seek\r\nthe solution of his problems by always bringing to bear his elements\r\nof strength against the hostile elements of weakness. It may be found,\r\non occasion, that it is necessary or desirable to act with strength\r\nagainst strength.\r\n\r\nBut it is equally faulty to maintain that action, to be effective,\r\nseeks always to deal with the enemy by first destroying his elements\r\nof strength. Even when the strongest opposition cannot be defeated by\r\ndirect action of this nature, success may still be possible by first\r\ndisposing of elements of weakness. When the stronger elements of a\r\nhostile combination cannot be defeated without undue loss, yet cannot\r\nstand without the weaker, consideration may well be given to an\r\napportionment of fighting strength on the basis of seeking a decision\r\nagainst the latter. The defeat of a relatively small force at a\r\ndistance from the area where the main forces are concentrated in\r\nopposition, may hasten the attainment of the ultimate objective.\r\n\r\nThe main effort, where the greater force is employed, may be identical\r\nwith the effort contributing most directly to the final result. This\r\nidentity, however, does not always exist, and the decisive influence\r\nis frequently exerted by a relatively small force, sometimes at a\r\ndistance from the principal area of action.\r\n\r\nDiversions (see also as to feints, page 59) are not likely to be\r\nprofitable unless constituting a sufficient threat, or unless offering\r\napparent advantages to the enemy which he feels that he cannot forego.\r\nSuccess will attend justified diversions if they lead the enemy to\r\nreapportion his fighting strength to meet the threat, either because\r\nhe expects repetitions (see page 73, as to raids), or because the area\r\ninvolved may become a new theater of action, or for other pertinent\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nMeans which are inadequate for the attainment of an objective if used\r\nin one effort may sometimes be rendered adequate by utilizing them in\r\na series of successive impulses. Similarly, the effect of employing\r\nmeans otherwise adequate may be intensified by the delivery of attacks\r\nin waves.\r\n\r\nProcedure for Determining Proper Apportionment. The fundamental\r\nconsiderations outlined above as to apportionment of fighting strength\r\nhave application both to the offensive and the defensive (see also\r\ndiscussion on page 75). As to all of these considerations, the\r\nsolution for the particular situation is to be found only through an\r\nanalysis of the factors applying to the particular problem.\r\n\r\nThus, the first consideration relates to suitability, and requires\r\nthat the apportionment of means be suitable both as to type and as to\r\namount, in order to produce the appropriate effect desired in view of\r\nthe means opposed and of the influence of the characteristics of the\r\ntheater. The fundamentals involved, applicable in all human activities\r\n(see the Principle of the Proper Means to be Made Available--page 34),\r\nare the factors cited above. These are also, of course, indicated in\r\nthe Fundamental Military Principle.\r\n\r\nThe correct apportionment may also be influenced by any military\r\nchanges to be effected in the characteristics of the theater (as\r\nindicated in the Principle of Proper Physical Conditions to be\r\nEstablished--page 34). Thus, the establishment of a well defended base\r\nmay operate, properly, to reduce the requirements for apportionment of\r\na force for a particular duty in that locality. Similarly, the proper\r\nuse of fortifications, obstacles, demolitions, and routes by land,\r\nsea, and air, as well as facilities for exchange of information and\r\norders, all operate to increase fighting strength relative to that of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThe next consideration, that of feasibility, takes account of the type\r\nand of the amount of means that can be apportioned in view of the\r\nmeans available.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing there will be appropriate\r\nrequirements for the operation as a whole and for its component\r\noperations. All of these requirements may call for analysis of the\r\nrelative positions to be utilized, with reference to the selected\r\nphysical objectives, and of the requirements for adequate freedom of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nFinally, the requirement of acceptability as to the factor of\r\nconsequences will call for consideration of the results of the\r\nallotments of forces to particular tasks. This is necessary in order\r\nto arrive at reasonable conclusions as to the military costs involved\r\neither in event of the success of the effort or in event of its\r\nfailure, and with respect, more especially, to the effects on future\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe attainment of the objective, however suitable as to the effect\r\ndesired, may be found, on the basis of due study, to be infeasible or\r\nto involve unacceptable consequences. The inescapable conclusion is\r\nthen that an increase in relative fighting strength is required or\r\nthat another objective, feasible of attainment and acceptable with\r\nrespect to consequences, is necessarily to be adopted (see page\r\n52-53).\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedom of Action\r\n\r\nFundamental Considerations. In providing for proper apportionment of\r\nfighting strength, a commander may attain the end in view by\r\nincreasing the physical, mental, or moral elements of his own\r\nstrength, relative to the enemy's, or by decreasing the enemy's\r\nstrength through imposing restrictions on hostile freedom of action.\r\n\r\nFreedom of action will enable a commander to prosecute his plan in\r\nspite of restrictive influences. That enemy interference will, to a\r\ngreater or less extent, impose restrictions on freedom of action is to\r\nbe expected. Restrictions may also be imposed by physical conditions\r\nexisting in the theater of operations, and by deficiencies and\r\nomissions which are within the field of responsibility of the\r\ncommander to correct.\r\n\r\nEven with fighting strength adequate to overcome enemy opposition and\r\nphysical handicaps, deficiencies and omissions within a commander's\r\nown field may become effective checks to further progress unless\r\navoided through the exercise of foresight. To this end, it is\r\ndesirable to consider certain possibilities which are likely to\r\npromote freedom of action if properly exploited, and to restrict it if\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nTo a considerable extent, a commander has within his own control the\r\ndegree of influence which his force will exert in the creation or the\r\nmaintenance of a favorable military situation. The power applied by a\r\nmilitary force is determined not only by the fighting strength of its\r\ncomponent commands, but also by the degree of coordination of their\r\nseveral efforts in the attainment of the objective (see also page 12).\r\nWhatever the inability of the commander to influence the other aspects\r\nof a situation, the ability of his command to act unitedly is a matter\r\nlargely in his hands.\r\n\r\nWhen time permits, subordinate commanders, apprised of contemplated\r\ntasks in general terms, may be called upon to submit recommendations\r\nas to the detailed instructions to be issued them, as well (page 66)\r\nas to the means to be allotted for the purpose. By this procedure,\r\nindividual initiative (page 15) is fostered and the higher command\r\nenabled to utilize the first-hand knowledge and experience gained on\r\nlower echelons without, however, divesting the higher command of any\r\nof its responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe command system may provide for unified action through unity of\r\ncommand or through cooperation resulting from mutual understanding. On\r\nthe assumption that commanders are competent and that communications\r\nare adequate, unity of command is the more reliable method. However,\r\nit cannot be obtained everywhere and at all times, because of the\r\nnecessary decentralization of the command system in areas distant from\r\nthe commander. In such areas, unity of effort may sometimes be assured\r\nby provision for local unity of command. At other times, unity of\r\neffort may depend entirely on cooperation between adjacent commands\r\nwithin the same area. (See page 12.)\r\n\r\nOrganization (see page 13), the mechanism of command, is most\r\neffective when, through the establishment of authority commensurate\r\nwith responsibility (page 12) and through the assignment of tasks to\r\ncommanders with appropriate capabilities (see also page 66), the\r\nhighest possible degree of unity of command is attained. The command\r\norganization and mutual understanding are of primary importance as\r\nmethods of ensuring maximum power with available fighting strength,\r\nand of affording consequent maximum contribution to freedom of action.\r\n\r\nDeficiencies in technical training are capable of imposing grave\r\nrestrictions upon freedom of action. Material equipment, even though\r\nit may represent the acme of perfection in design and construction,\r\nwill not surely function unless skillfully operated and maintained.\r\nEven though mobility and endurance be otherwise assured, the capacity\r\nwhich they represent is not susceptible of effective employment unless\r\nthe methods of movement, i.e., of effecting change in relative\r\nposition (page 59), are intelligently planned and are developed to a\r\npoint which assures facility of operation when in the hands of skilled\r\npersonnel.\r\n\r\nTactical training, not omitting that required for joint operations\r\n(page 67), is one of the vital factors of fighting strength, with\r\nrespect, more especially, to its contributions to freedom of action.\r\n\r\nA state of high and stable morale (page 9), founded upon sound\r\ndiscipline, is an invaluable characteristic of fighting strength. An\r\nunderstanding of the human being is therefore an important feature of\r\nthe science of war.\r\n\r\nDiscipline, in its basic meaning, is the treatment suitable to a\r\ndisciple. The objective of discipline is therefore the creation and\r\nmaintenance of the spirit of willingness to follow where the commander\r\nleads. The exercise of leadership is not restricted, however, to those\r\noccasions when the commander can be physically present. The exigencies\r\nof war and the requirements of control prevent the commander from\r\nbeing always, personally, in the forefront of action. These\r\nrestrictions as to considerations of space however, impose no\r\nlimitations on leadership in terms of time.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the competent commander is a factor always acting to\r\nshape the situation according to his will (page 47), though the\r\nnecessities of the moment may compel his presence elsewhere. The\r\nability to create and maintain a faithful following who will execute\r\nthe commander's will wherever he may be (page 15) is, accordingly, a\r\nprimary attribute of command.\r\n\r\nWith this objective in mind, the true disciplinarian runs no risk of\r\nconfusing harshness with the exercise of justice. He understands the\r\ndifference between an overbearing arrogance, arising from unconscious\r\nignorance, and the pride which springs from a justified self-respect.\r\nHe appreciates the distinction between mere stubbornness, which would\r\nalienate his followers, and the necessary firmness which binds the\r\nbonds between the leader and the led. He realizes that comradeship,\r\nwithout presumptuous familiarity, is the firmest foundation for mutual\r\nloyalty (page 14). He knows that kindness and consideration, without\r\nsuggestion of pampering, will not be mistaken for weakness by any\r\nsubordinate worthy of the name.\r\n\r\nMilitary subordination, which implies a proud obedience without trace\r\nof servility, is the essential basis for the development of the\r\nqualities of command. It is an old adage that, to know how to command,\r\none must know how to obey. In the profession of arms, every man is at\r\nonce a leader and a follower; the uncertainties of war may suddenly\r\nconfront any individual, even on the lowest echelon, with the call to\r\nexercise command.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of sound discipline are thus the correct basis for\r\nall training. By proper training of his command, by instilling in it a\r\nspirit of resolute determination and by otherwise fostering its\r\nmorale, and by weakening the morale of the enemy, a commander may\r\nincrease his own fighting strength and reduce that of the opposition.\r\nWhen a command is inured to the ill effects of fear, despondency, lack\r\nof confidence, and other weakening influences, it may more effectually\r\nemploy measures calculated to upset the morale of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these measures, surprise, when judiciously\r\nconceived and successfully employed, may be a most potent factor.\r\nSurprise (see page 26) is the injection of the unexpected for the\r\npurpose of creating an unfavorable military situation for the enemy.\r\nIts effect is particularly telling when it results in disruption of\r\nenemy plans, and thus promotes the execution of one's own.\r\n\r\nThe raid, an offensive measure swiftly executed, often by surprise,\r\nand followed by a withdrawal, may be a valuable operation when\r\nemployed to attain objectives within its capacity. The collection of\r\ninformation, the destruction of important enemy equipment or supplies,\r\nthe neutralization of enemy positions, the severing of physical means\r\nof communication and transport, and the like, are suitable objectives.\r\nThe attritional effect of repeated raids may be very great. Skillfully\r\nexecuted raids frequently produce panic among the populace and thus,\r\nby political pressure, cause a change in the existing apportionment of\r\nfighting strength to the extent of upsetting military plans in other\r\ntheaters. This is particularly likely to occur when there is fear,\r\njustified or otherwise, of repetition (see page 69).\r\n\r\nHowever, because a raid necessarily includes a withdrawal and cannot,\r\ntherefore, accomplish the occupation of territory (see page 46), it\r\ncan have only indirect bearing, however important, upon the final\r\noutcome of the hostilities against a strong and competent enemy. Like\r\nother forms of surprise, the raid, injudiciously employed, may serve\r\nonly to disclose one's presence, and thus to betray more important\r\nfuture plans. If the raid fails to attain its objective, it may even\r\nstrengthen enemy morale.\r\n\r\nThe form which surprise may take is not confined to the stratagem, the\r\nruse, or the sudden appearance. Any unexpected display of novel\r\nmethods or of fighting strength, moral, mental, or physical, the\r\nlast-named sometimes assuming the character of new and especially\r\neffective weapons or equipment, is included in the category of\r\nsurprise. The potential value of such methods or weapons is, however,\r\nreduced or even completely vitiated by the leakage of advance\r\ninformation concerning them, not only as to their details, but as to\r\nthe fact of their existence.\r\n\r\nOther conditions remaining unchanged, an offensive surprise measure is\r\ntherefore more likely to be effective when the opponent has not been\r\ngiven time to prepare a defense against it. On the other hand, where\r\nthere is knowledge that an opponent or possible opponent is taking\r\nsteps of a new or unusual nature and no adequate defense is prepared,\r\nthe equivalent of surprise has been granted him.\r\n\r\nSecurity measures are necessary in order to minimize or prevent\r\nsurprise, or to defeat other efforts aimed at disruption of plans.\r\nProtection brings security; its basic objective is the conservation of\r\nfighting strength for future employment. Primarily requiring the\r\nmaintenance of secrecy and the exercise of vigilance and foresight,\r\nsecurity may be furthered by efficient scouting, by appropriate\r\ndispositions and formations within the command, and by the use of\r\nprotective detachments and of various types of works in the sphere of\r\nengineering. Previous discussion (pages 64 and 69), with respect to\r\nrelative position and to the apportionment of fighting strength, has\r\nindicated how, through fortification and related measures, the\r\ncommander may increase relative fighting strength and thereby promote\r\nhis own freedom of action while restricting that of the enemy.\r\n\r\nA commander will be hampered in maintaining his fighting strength at\r\nits maximum unless he has arranged for, and has at his disposal,\r\nadequate logistics support. Because of its intimate relationship to\r\nmobility and endurance, such support is an essential to freedom of\r\naction. Logistics support requires provision for procurement and\r\nreplenishment of supplies, for evacuation, proper disposition, and\r\nreplacement of ineffective personnel, and for material maintenance.\r\nFreedom of action is restricted beyond those limits to which logistics\r\nsupport can be extended. (See page 63.)\r\n\r\nThe initiative is of paramount importance in ensuring freedom of\r\naction. If the initiative is seized and maintained with adequate\r\nstrength, the enemy can only conform; he cannot lead. If initiative is\r\nlost, freedom of action is restricted in like measure.\r\n\r\nThe offensive, properly employed, is a method of seizing the\r\ninitiative, and of regaining it if lost. Even though there be an\r\nactual numerical superiority in fighting strength, an offensive will,\r\nhowever, seldom assume practical form unless founded on an offensive\r\nmental attitude, which ever seeks the favorable and suitable\r\nopportunity to strike. Completely to abandon the offensive state of\r\nmind is to forswear victory.\r\n\r\nWhether physically on the defensive or the offensive, the competent\r\ncommander is always engaged in a mental and moral attack upon the will\r\nof the enemy commander (see page 8). By effective attack upon the\r\nhostile will, the commander disintegrates the enemy's plan, i.e., the\r\nenemy's reasoned decision, as well as the detailed procedure on which\r\nthe enemy relies to carry this decision into effect.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that offensive action is possible or even desirable\r\nunder all circumstances. Even with superior strength the most skillful\r\ncommander will scarcely be able, always, to apportion forces in such\r\nmanner as everywhere to permit the assumption of the offensive.\r\nWithout adequately superior strength, it may be necessary to adopt the\r\ndefensive for considerable periods. If the offensive mental attitude\r\nis retained, together with fixed determination to take offensive\r\nmeasures as soon as appropriate to do so, the calculated and\r\ndeliberate adoption of the defensive, for the proper length of time,\r\nmay best promote the ultimate attainment of the objective. It is of\r\nthe utmost importance, however, that a static defensive be not adopted\r\nas a settled procedure (see page 65) beyond the time necessary to\r\nprepare for an effective offensive.\r\n\r\nBoth the offensive and the defensive have their places in an operation\r\nwhose broad character is primarily either defensive or offensive. In\r\noperations which involve movement over a considerable distance, a\r\ncombination of the offensive and the defensive is usually found\r\nnecessary (see also references to distant operations on pages 63 and\r\n74). Though the movement itself be offensive, the ensurance of freedom\r\nof action may require both defensive measures and tactically offensive\r\naction. The enemy, primarily on the defensive, may be expected to\r\nseize every opportunity to employ the offensive.\r\n\r\nThus, a judicious combination of the offensive and the defensive has\r\nbeen found to be sound procedure (see also page 61), provided that the\r\ngeneral defensive is always viewed as a basis for the inauguration, at\r\nthe proper moment, of the offensive. The methods employed during the\r\nperiod of the defensive are best calculated to promote freedom of\r\naction if they are designed to facilitate a ready assumption of the\r\noffensive as soon as conditions favorable to the offensive have been\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with the physical characteristics of the actual and\r\npossible theaters of operations, and accurate intelligence of the\r\nstrength, distribution, and activities of enemy forces likely to be\r\nencountered, are of primary importance in the promotion of freedom of\r\naction. Additions to this store of knowledge may be made by a\r\ncontinuous interpretation and dissemination of new information\r\ncollected, analyzed, and evaluated by persistent effort. Of equal\r\nimportance is the denial of information to the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn connection with counter-information measures (see page 127), the\r\nscrutiny of information of a military nature intended for popular\r\nconsumption demands the exercise of sound professional judgment prior\r\nto publication. A resourceful enemy is ever alert to evaluate and turn\r\nto his own advantage all available information, including that\r\nostensibly innocuous.\r\n\r\nAs to all of the foregoing considerations, a fund of professional\r\nknowledge, previously acquired through study, or experience, or both,\r\nand coupled with a sound concept of war, is the best basis for\r\ndevising suitable, feasible, and acceptable measures for freedom of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWith a given fighting strength, the ensurance of freedom of action,\r\nwithin the field of responsibility of a commander, requires\r\nconsideration of such matters as:\r\n\r\n  (a) Efficient provisions for exercise of command,\r\n  (b) Effective training,\r\n  (c) A state of high and stable morale, founded on\r\n  (d) sound discipline,\r\n  (e) The offensive spirit,\r\n  (f) The initiative,\r\n  (g) Surprise,\r\n  (h) Security,\r\n  (i) Adequate logistics support,\r\n  (j) Adequate intelligence and counter-intelligence.\r\n\r\nA more detailed analysis of such factors is provided hereafter\r\n(Chapter VI, as to Section I-B of the Estimate Form). With proper\r\nprovision made in these respects, the commander will be better able to\r\ndeal with those restrictions on freedom of action imposed by the enemy\r\nand by adverse geographical conditions. With respect to restrictions\r\nthat in a particular situation may be due to the latter cause, it will\r\nat once be appreciated how greatly freedom of action may depend on the\r\nselection of correct physical objectives, on utilization of\r\nadvantageous relative positions, and on an effective apportionment of\r\nfighting strength.\r\n\r\nEach measure, or each operation, for freedom of action, if it is to\r\nmeet the requirements of suitability, feasibility, and acceptability,\r\nwill be planned on the basis of the foregoing considerations and will\r\ntake account, also, of the inherent requirements of that measure, or\r\noperation, for freedom of action for itself.\r\n\r\nOn occasion, higher authority may request the recommendations of the\r\ncommander (see page 42, as to opinions) with reference to provision\r\nfor freedom of action. Such recommendations will properly be based on\r\nthe elements considered in the preceding discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAll these considerations involve the proper evaluation of the factors\r\napplicable (page 25) to the particular problem. Each objective, prior\r\nto its selection, and each operation, prior to its adoption, will\r\nrequire examination of its suitability with regard to the appropriate\r\neffect desired; of its feasibility with respect to the action\r\ncontemplated as to physical objectives, relative positions, the\r\nconcurrent apportionment of fighting strength, and freedom of action;\r\nand, finally, of its acceptability with reference to consequences as\r\nto costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR STEPS IN THE SOLUTION OF A MILITARY PROBLEM\r\n\r\n    Chapter V discusses the four steps in the application of\r\n    mental effort to the successful attainment of a military\r\n    objective. Emphasis is placed on such matters as: the Estimate\r\n    of the Situation in basic problems, together with certain\r\n    details as to tasks, the mission, courses of action, and the\r\n    Decision; the formulation of detailed plans, including\r\n    subsidiary plans; directives; the Running Estimate of the\r\n    Situation; and the use of Forms in the solution of problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapter II it has been brought to notice that every problem,\r\nregardless of its type and scope, has its source in a perplexity\r\ncreated by an apparent difficulty inherent in a situation. Where there\r\nis a sufficient incentive to change or maintain the situation, the\r\nproblem is one which requires solution. (See page 20.)\r\n\r\nA situation may be actual or assumed. In broad outline, an actual\r\nmilitary situation is always likely to present a picture of opposing\r\norganizations of human beings, each possessed of fighting strength and\r\ndisposed in a locality or localities which constitute relative\r\npositions with reference to each other.\r\n\r\nThis picture may be expected to assume various aspects as action\r\nprogresses (see page 38). The concern of the commander is to control\r\nthe unfolding of the original situation, to the end that he may attain\r\nthe effect he desires (page 72). (See also Chapter IX.)\r\n\r\nThe incentive to solve a problem is provided by a realization, on the\r\npart of the individual concerned, of a need to make provision for the\r\nattainment of an objective. In the ease of a military problem, such\r\nincentive may result (1) from a directive issued by higher authority,\r\nusually in the form of an assigned task, or (2) from the fact that a\r\ndecision already reached by the commander has introduced further\r\nproblems, or (3) from a recognition of the demands of the situation.\r\n(See page 44.)\r\n\r\nAn objective is best attained by the successful application of\r\nproperly directed effort. There is thus an essential and continuing\r\nrelationship between the incentive to solve a problem, and the task\r\nwhich assigns the objective (or objectives) and thus motivates the\r\nprocedure necessary for the attainment of the objective(s) so assigned\r\n(page 50).\r\n\r\nSuch a task may, therefore, be referred to as the motivating task.\r\n\r\nThe natural mental processes which normal human beings employ in\r\nsolving their problems of business, public affairs, or even personal\r\nmatters, have been previously described as the natural processes for\r\nemployment in the solution of military problems (see Chapter II). In\r\nadapting these natural processes to military requirements (page 43),\r\nthe only difference imposed is that of studied insistence that the\r\nfactors peculiar to the conduct of war, as recognized in the\r\nFundamental Military Principle (page 41), receive thorough analytical\r\ntreatment from the professional viewpoint.\r\n\r\nThe same observations apply when the field of military operations is\r\nrestricted to that which primarily concerns the naval branch of the\r\nmilitary profession. No fundamental difference in the solution of\r\nproblems is introduced thereby. The only variations in the application\r\nof the Fundamental Military Principle are those due to the fact that\r\nthe sea provides the theater of naval operations with distinctive\r\ncharacteristics (see page 62).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Approach to the Solution\r\n\r\nStudies of the subject indicate that the successful attainment of an\r\nassigned military objective involves the application of mental effort\r\nin four distinct steps (see page 3), in fixed sequence, as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) The selection, by the commander, of a correct objective\r\n        (or objectives) by achieving which he may attain his\r\n        assigned objective(s). Such selection includes the\r\n        determination, in proper detail, of the action required.\r\n\r\n    (2) The resolution of the required action into detailed\r\n        military operations.\r\n\r\n    (3) The formulation of a directive, or directives, with the\r\n        intention of immediately inaugurating planned action.\r\n\r\n    (4) The supervision of the planned action.\r\n\r\nIn the chapters which follow, the fundamental procedure distinctive of\r\neach of these steps will be treated separately and in the sequence\r\nshown. The sequence of the steps is fixed because of the consequential\r\nnature of the relationship among the procedures distinctive of the\r\nseveral steps. The complete solution of a problem involves,\r\nnecessarily, all four steps. Each step deals with a distinctive type\r\nof problem, or problems, pertaining to an aspect of the comprehensive\r\nproblem whose solution requires all four steps. No step after the\r\nfirst can properly be undertaken unless the included problems involved\r\nin the preceding steps have been solved.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that the completion of one step necessarily\r\nrequires that the next step be undertaken immediately. It will be\r\nseen, for instance, that the first two steps are concerned with\r\nplanning, the latter two more especially with execution. It is not\r\nalways necessary that a plan be executed; it may be drawn up as a\r\nprecautionary measure.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, therefore, that the first step only may be taken;\r\ni.e., that the procedure for the attainment of a particular assigned\r\nobjective may be determined for the sole purpose of making provision\r\nagainst a contingency, at that particular time merely an obscure\r\nprobability. Or, as may frequently be the case during peace, the\r\nprocedure may terminate, for the time being, with the completion of\r\nthe second step. In such cases, certain of the necessary military\r\noperations are worked out in the desired detail as a provision against\r\nfuture possibilities, are listed, and filed for reference as needed.\r\n\r\nParts II and III, which follow, deal primarily with the solution of\r\nthose problems of the naval commander which require familiarity with\r\nthe entire process, i.e., all of the four steps given above.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity of presentation, the procedure is described throughout\r\nfrom the mental standpoint of the same commander. The arrangement of\r\nsubject matter conforms to this basis. The several types of problems,\r\nclassified according to the source of the incentive (page 79), are\r\ndiscussed in connection with the appropriate step. When a problem\r\ntypical of a previous step arises during the process, the sequence of\r\nsteps is interrupted thereby, but is resumed by a mental return, on\r\nthe part of the commander, to the proper earlier step.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Step\r\n\r\nThe mental procedure distinctive of the first step (more fully\r\ndiscussed in Chapter VI) deals with the usual case where a commander\r\nbecomes acquainted with the nature of his assigned objective through\r\nreceipt of a directive from his immediate superior, ordinarily in the\r\nform of an assigned task or assigned tasks. In the discussion of the\r\nfirst step, this most likely type of problem is chosen for\r\ndescription, i.e., the one where the motivating task (see page 80)\r\ncomes directly from the immediate superior.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of reference, this problem may conveniently be termed a\r\nbasic problem. In such a case the original situation which gives\r\ncharacter to the problem may be similarly referred to as the basic\r\nsituation. The full solution of a basic problem always involves a\r\nbasic estimate of the situation, a basic Decision, a basic plan of\r\noperations, and one or more basic directives. It may, as will be\r\nshown, also require certain additional directives.\r\n\r\nThe military Estimate of the Situation, based on the natural mental\r\nprocesses (pages 19-20 and 43), is introduced in the first step. The\r\nreason for making such an Estimate is to provide a basis for a plan to\r\naccomplish the assigned task. The Estimate constitutes a systematic\r\nprocedure for selection of a correct objective (or objectives),\r\nsuitable to the appropriate effect desired, feasible of attainment,\r\nand acceptable as to the consequences involved in its achievement. The\r\nselection of such an objective or objectives involves, incidentally\r\n(see page 44), the determination, in the proper detail, of the action\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThis estimate procedure is founded on the Fundamental Military\r\nPrinciple (page 41). The procedure is the same as previously indicated\r\nfor the correct selection of objectives (Section II of Chapter IV).\r\n\r\nOn the basis of a summary of the situation, a recognition of the\r\nincentive, and an appreciation of the assigned objective(s) (page 79),\r\nthe estimate of a basic problem enables the commander to obtain,\r\nfirst, an understanding of (page 43) the appropriate effect desired.\r\nAs a result of this procedure, he can then correctly formulate his\r\nmission (discussed hereinafter).\r\n\r\nFor the further understanding of all details pertaining to the\r\nsituation (page 43), the estimate next determines relative fighting\r\nstrength through a survey of the means available and opposed, as\r\ninfluenced by the characteristics of the theater.\r\n\r\nWith the basis for solution of the problem thus established, the\r\nactual solution (page 44), conforming to the system indicated in the\r\nFundamental Military Principle, starts with consideration of pertinent\r\nmethods of procedure, as tentative solutions of the problem. These\r\ntake the form of military operations, each denominated a course of\r\naction (discussed in detail hereinafter). Each such course embodies,\r\nspecifically or inferentially, an objective to be achieved for the\r\nattainment of the appropriate effect desired. Each course also\r\nindicates, in proper detail, the action to be taken. Every pertinent\r\ncourse of action is tested to determine whether it meets the\r\nrequirements of suitability as to the appropriate effect desired, of\r\nfeasibility on the basis of relative fighting strength, and of\r\nacceptability with respect to the consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\nEnemy courses of action are subjected to the same treatment.\r\n\r\nEach course of action which passes the tests is compared with each\r\nretained enemy course, after which those courses of action not\r\nrejected on this basis are compared with each other. The best is then\r\nselected and embodied in the Decision.\r\n\r\nThe Decision, accordingly, expresses a general plan of action (or\r\nprovides a basis therefor), including the commander's general\r\nobjective (page 49) for the attainment of the assigned objective. The\r\nDecision also indicates, in proper detail, the action to be taken.\r\n\r\nThe estimate procedure is applicable not only to the problem of the\r\nfirst step, viewed as a whole, but also to the numerous included\r\nproblems. These present themselves during the procedure of solution,\r\nand call for \"estimates within the estimate\".\r\n\r\nFor example, the proper nature of the objective embodied in the\r\nassigned task (discussed hereinafter), if not clear in the directive\r\nreceived, may be determined by the use of the natural mental\r\nprocesses. This is done through the application of the Fundamental\r\nMilitary Principle, as previously described (page 52).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the solution of the included problems as to the salient\r\nfeatures of the operations involved (correct physical objectives,\r\netc.) can be arrived at through the same processes. The procedure is\r\nthat indicated previously (in Section III of Chapter IV).\r\n\r\nThe estimate procedure may, however, be somewhat varied, as to\r\ndetails, in accordance with the nature of the problem. Such adaptation\r\nis applicable, for example, as to the special features which\r\ndistinguish certain types of strategical and tactical problems.\r\n\r\nEvery military situation has both strategical and tactical aspects\r\n(see discussion of strategy and tactics, pages 9 and 10). The\r\ncharacter of the effort to be exerted at a particular time, and the\r\nnature of the objectives to be attained, may be governed chiefly by\r\nstrategical, or chiefly by tactical, considerations. This fact may\r\naffect details in the estimate of the situation, e.g., as to the\r\nweight to be given various factors.\r\n\r\nThe essential difference between strategy and tactics has been shown\r\nto lie in the end in view. It follows, then, that estimates of broad\r\nstrategical situations and of localized tactical situations tend to\r\ndiffer from each other. The former lead to decisions as to such\r\nmatters, among others, as whether a battle shall be fought. The latter\r\nlead to decisions, among others, as to the comprehensive tactical\r\nmethods to be followed in furtherance of strategical aims. Certain\r\ndistinctions of method as to such estimates are noted hereinafter with\r\nrespect to the analysis of fighting strength and with reference to\r\ncourses of action.\r\n\r\nTasks. The assignment of tasks to subordinates is an essential\r\nfunction of the chain of command, applicable to all of the echelons of\r\ncommand, from the highest to the lowest (page 12). On the lowest\r\nechelons, such as that of a gun's crew or a fireroom watch, operations\r\nthus prescribed involve numerous small specialized tasks, each\r\nrequiring the performance of a simplified routine by a few trained\r\nmen. Although earlier training in the performance of such tasks is\r\ncalculated to remove the necessity of solving the problems of the\r\nlowest echelons in the four studied steps stated above, it is only\r\nwhen the same methods of logical thought have previously been applied\r\nto the solution of these problems that this state of affairs can be\r\nbrought about.\r\n\r\nProperly conceived, each assigned task indicates, either specifically\r\nor inferentially, an objective (or objectives). The relationships\r\nexisting among the echelons of command, with reference to objectives,\r\nhave previously been noted. (See page 48.) These relationships,\r\nbecause a correctly conceived task specifies or infers an objective,\r\nare equally applicable as to such tasks.\r\n\r\nThe manner of expressing tasks calls for special comment (see also\r\npage 53, as to expressing objectives).\r\n\r\nThe commander may find in the expression of his task a statement,\r\nonly, of the action required. For example, the order \"Proceed toward\r\nthe enemy battle line\" involves movement, indicating merely a change\r\nin relative position. No provision appears as to a future condition or\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\nAgain, the task may be expressed as an order to \"Attack the enemy\r\nbattle line.\" In this case, the enemy battle line is the physical\r\nobjective, but no specific future condition to result from the attack\r\nis indicated. Here the action and the physical objective are given,\r\nbut the objective is left to be inferred.\r\n\r\nIf the commander can ascertain, from the directives he receives, his\r\ntask expressed in terms of accomplishment, he may be able to\r\nvisualize the action, the physical objective, and the condition to be\r\ncreated. The order \"Destroy the enemy battleship\" (indicating, as the\r\nobjective, \"the destruction of the enemy battleship\"), results, when\r\nsuccessfully completed, in a new condition which is the objective of\r\nthe action against the physical objective.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a task expressed in such terms of accomplishment conveys\r\nprecise information as to the objective; yet such an expression of the\r\ntask does not prevent freedom of action, with opportunity for exercise\r\nof initiative. The commander who is assigned such a task can clearly\r\nvisualize the results demanded of him, and may feel at liberty to\r\nemploy any one or all of the methods at his disposal.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not always possible or even desirable to express tasks\r\nin terms of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nFor example, where the future situation cannot be adequately\r\nvisualized, either because of the doubtful values of certain factors\r\nor because of possible changes in circumstances, it may be\r\nimpracticable to assign a definite task in terms of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, and sometimes for other proper reasons, it may\r\nbe desirable to afford a trusted and competent subordinate a\r\ncorresponding measure of freedom of action. In such a case, the\r\nindication of the commander's general objective for his entire force,\r\ntogether with a directive for action along a certain general line,\r\nwithout prescription of a definite objective, may be especially\r\nappropriate to the situation. Such is the frequent usage in the issue,\r\nfor example, of directives of the type known as letters of instruction\r\n(Chapter VIII).\r\n\r\nAgain, where immediate response is desired, and where the objective\r\nmay be understood by implication, the task may be better expressed in\r\nterms of action, rather than of accomplishment. This is frequently the\r\ncase where the task is assigned by word of mouth, by memorandum, or by\r\nsignal. In the last-named instance, the signal, when it constitutes a\r\ncommand fully understood by previous usage or experience, may convey a\r\npractically instantaneous comprehension of the objective. In many such\r\ninstances, however, an inferred objective will require more analysis.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the task in terms of action is frequently desirable,\r\nmore especially during an engagement, when tactical considerations are\r\nuppermost. Under such circumstances, two or more objectives may be\r\nsuitable to the appropriate effect desired, but their degree of\r\nsuitability, and the influence of the factors pertaining to\r\nfeasibility and acceptability, may vary rapidly with the course of\r\nevents. In such conditions, an order such as \"Attack\" without\r\nindicating a specific physical objective, may be best calculated to\r\nattain desired results, for the reason, more especially, that it\r\naffords the subordinate a proper freedom of action.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, the instructions received by a commander will set forth\r\nmore than one task, often of varying importance. The proper bearing of\r\nsuch a double or multiple task upon his future action is set forth,\r\ntogether with other relevant matters, in the discussion of the\r\nmission, which follows.\r\n\r\nOn occasion, a higher commander, in assigning a task, may elect to\r\nspecify, also, the course of action to be pursued by a subordinate for\r\nthe attainment of the assigned objective: for example--\r\n\r\n    \"Deny enemy bases in area ABCD by capturing X Island\".\r\n\r\nHere the task is to deny the enemy the use of available bases in the\r\narea described; in addition, the higher commander has specified that\r\nthis be accomplished by the adoption of a predetermined course of\r\naction (page 88), expressed in the words \"by capturing X Island.\"\r\nHigher authority has in this case made the subordinate's estimate of\r\nthe situation for him, and has thus arrived at the decision which the\r\nsubordinate would ordinarily reach for himself.\r\n\r\nSuch procedure may be deemed advisable under certain circumstances:\r\nfor example, when time is pressing; when a close control of the\r\nsituation is an important factor; when the qualifications of the\r\nsubordinate are unknown, as yet doubtful, or known to be inadequate\r\nfor the operation in hand; or, for various other reasons which may\r\nsuggest themselves according to the nature of the problem.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, higher authority, for similar reasons, may also\r\nprescribe the action to be taken, in considerable detail. Examples\r\noccur during operations of unusual complexity, or when the personnel\r\nfactors call for special care in coordination of the action.\r\n\r\nSometimes, higher authority, instead of announcing both the task and\r\nthe predetermined course of action, may indicate only the latter; in\r\nthe example given above, the higher commander would then direct,\r\n\"Capture X Island\". The directive might also include, in some detail,\r\nthe action to be taken to this end.\r\n\r\nProcedure such as noted in the foregoing examples involves certain\r\nspecial considerations from the viewpoint of the subordinate. These\r\nconsiderations are discussed hereafter (page 96).\r\n\r\nThe Mission. In our naval service an assigned task, coupled with its\r\npurpose, is known as a mission. As explained previously (page 48), the\r\npurpose indicates the larger aim which is to be served by the\r\nexecution of the task. The task indicates the assigned objective,\r\ni.e., what is to be accomplished; the purpose, the further objective\r\nto be served thereby.\r\n\r\nThe word mission is a derivative of the Latin verb, \"to send\". Its use\r\nimplies the act of sending someone, or of being sent, as an agent for\r\nsome special duty, a duty imposed by one in authority. Although an\r\nindividual, free to do so, may select his own mission, and thereby\r\nsend himself on a special duty, this is not usually the case where an\r\neffective military chain of command exists. Normally the sending\r\nauthority is the immediate superior; the agent, the immediate\r\nsubordinate.\r\n\r\nThe mission, once assigned, does not change until it has been\r\naccomplished or until it has been modified or revoked by higher\r\nauthority, usually the immediate superior by whom it was assigned.\r\n\r\nAs previously explained in this connection, the designation of a\r\npurpose, linked with a task, is an essential element of a mission as\r\ntreated herein. It is essential to unity of effort that the purpose of\r\nthe mission of a commander be common with that of other commanders of\r\nthe same echelon who are to participate in the effort enjoined by\r\ntheir superior's directives. Directives expressed in the Order Form\r\n(page 112 and Chapter VIII) facilitate clear recognition of this\r\npurpose, which appears in the general plan of action prescribed in the\r\nsecond paragraph of that form. The commander may consider the\r\nrelationship thus:\r\n\r\nMy assigned task is to be accomplished for the purpose of carrying out\r\nmy designated part of my immediate superior's general plan.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to simplify the foregoing to the statement that the\r\nmission is:\r\n\r\n(Task) (statement of the assigned task),\r\n\r\n(Purpose) in order to assist in the successful execution of (statement\r\nof the superior's general plan).\r\n\r\nThe words \"assist in\", etc., may frequently be understood and\r\ntherefore omitted.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing expression of a mission affords, as later explained\r\n(Chapter VI), a method for clear visualization of the effect desired\r\nby higher authority. (See also page 84.)\r\n\r\nAll of his assigned tasks which materially influence the commander's\r\nDecision (hereinafter discussed) are properly included in his mission;\r\nother tasks, naturally, may be omitted in this connection. In the case\r\nof a double or multiple task (page 86), all the tasks may be related\r\nto a single purpose, or the included tasks may each, or in certain\r\ncombinations, be linked separately to appropriate purposes.\r\n\r\nSurvey of Factors of Fighting Strength. The feasibility and\r\nacceptability of action for the attainment of an objective are\r\ndependent (see the Fundamental Military Principle--page 41) on the\r\nfactors of fighting strength. Fighting strength (page 35) is derived\r\nfrom the means available and opposed, as influenced by the\r\ncharacteristics of the theater of operations. A survey of these\r\nfactors, in proper detail according to the nature of the problem, is\r\ntherefore a necessary phase in the process of its solution. Such a\r\nsurvey completes the basis for the study of courses of action.\r\n\r\nCourses of Action. The estimate process naturally takes account (page\r\n80) of methods for attaining the objective indicated in the assigned\r\ntask. The military profession has, from time to time, applied a\r\nvariety of terms to designate such methods. Terms so used include,\r\namong others, \"plans open to us\" (or \"to the enemy\"), \"lines of\r\naction\", and \"courses of action\". The last-noted, having been standard\r\nin our naval service for many years, is the term used in this\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nEach course of action is thus a plan of military operations for the\r\nattainment of the assigned objective, and each thus indicates (page\r\n37) \"an act or a series of acts\" which may be undertaken to that end.\r\nUntil a final selection is made for embodiment in the Decision, each\r\ncourse of action is a tentative solution of the problem. For the\r\nreason given below, a course of action, while under consideration as a\r\ntentative solution of the problem, is also correctly conceived as\r\nindicating an objective and, in proper detail, the action for its\r\nattainment.\r\n\r\nWhen embodied in the Decision, the adopted course of action or\r\ncombination of courses becomes the commander's general plan (or the\r\nbasis thereof) for the employment of his force; such a general plan\r\nwill naturally indicate the commander's general objective (page 49)\r\nand, in proper detail, the action to be taken for its attainment (page\r\n44).\r\n\r\nThe objective may be specifically stated or may be inferred (see page\r\n82; also page 84 for the corresponding discussion of the expression\r\nof tasks); but, in any event, clear thinking demands that the\r\nobjective be definitely envisaged. There is a manifest advantage in\r\nsuch definite envisaging of the objectives involved in courses of\r\naction. Suitability as to the appropriate effect desired--the first\r\nrequirement in the selection of a correct objective (page 51)--is much\r\nmore readily tested on this basis. The practical bearing of this fact\r\nbecomes apparent during the early stages (Chapter VI) of the process\r\nof solving military problems.\r\n\r\nFrequent examples of naval courses of action include (see page 92):\r\n\r\n(1) \"To destroy the enemy force.\" Here the objective, \"destruction of\r\nthe enemy force\", is specifically indicated.\r\n\r\n(2) \"To divert the enemy force.\" Here also the objective, in this case\r\n\"diversion of the enemy force\", is specifically indicated.\r\n\r\n(3) \"To evade the enemy.\" Here again the objective, \"evasion of the\r\nenemy\", is specifically indicated.\r\n\r\n(4) \"To cover friendly and neutral trade.\" Here the objective,\r\n\"protection of friendly and neutral trade by the utilization of\r\nadvantageous covering positions\", is more or less inferred.\r\n\r\n(5) \"To escort trade.\" Here the objective, \"protection of trade by\r\nescorting it in convoys\", is more or less inferred.\r\n\r\n(6) \"To patrol the trade routes.\" Here the objective, e.g.,\r\n\"protection of trade by patrolling the trade routes\", is inferred.\r\n\r\n(7) \"To raid.\" Here the objective, e.g., \"infliction of loss and\r\ndamage by raiding\", is inferred.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing instances, the action to be taken is indicated in\r\ngeneral terms. The extent to which the action may properly be\r\nindicated depends on the nature of the problem and is necessarily left\r\nto the judgment of the commander. Two possibilities, between which\r\nthere may be various intermediate cases, are as follows:\r\n\r\n        (a) To destroy the enemy force by simultaneous attacks on\r\n    the escort and convoy.\r\n\r\n        (b) To destroy the enemy force by an attack with the main\r\n    force on the escort, following this immediately by an attack\r\n    on the convoy with a flanking force before the convoy can\r\n    scatter so widely as to make ineffective the pursuit of any of\r\n    its units.\r\n\r\nFor a further application, it will be noted that the national policies\r\nreferred to early in this discussion (page 7) are national courses of\r\naction, considered and adopted as methods of attaining national\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"courses of action\", in the sense of a plan considered\r\nor adopted as a solution of the problem, has the defect that it\r\nappears to emphasize the action, rather than the paramount component,\r\ni.e., the objective. So long as this fact is borne in mind, the\r\nlimitations of the term \"courses of action\" need not operate to\r\ninfluence, adversely, the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the commander brings to mind courses of action by the\r\nmental act of \"envisaging\", i.e., \"viewing with the mind's eye or\r\nconceptionally\", \"seeing as a mental image\", bringing fully and\r\ndistinctively to view. How is this done?\r\n\r\nAlthough the time available for the process depends on the particular\r\nproblem, the process itself is the same for all. During the\r\nclarification of the problem, the commander will have entertained\r\ncertain ideas,--ideas as to such matters as the existing situation,\r\nthe desired new situation, the possible physical objectives, the\r\nrelative positions and movements of the forces involved, and related\r\nmatters. His training and experience cause these ideas to evoke\r\nothers, which are associated in his mind with problems of the\r\npast,--in particular, with the bearing of such ideas on the outcome of\r\nthose problems.\r\n\r\nThis process of thinking, if it is to be effective as well as\r\nreflective, requires mental access to certain sources of ideas. These\r\nsources may lie in the study of history, or in the wealth of doctrine\r\nand instructions gathered into official manuals and into other\r\nprofessional writings, or in the commander's own practical experience.\r\nLogicians who have investigated this natural process point out that\r\nsuggested solutions are the resurrection of ideas from past\r\nexperience. Good thinking demands access to a large storehouse of\r\nideas connected in various and flexible ways. The best available\r\nknowledge is the main source from which reflective thinking obtains\r\nrelevant and promising suggestions for a solution.\r\n\r\nBy such resort to analogy, the commander utilizes the accumulations of\r\npast experience. Sometimes he finds that the courses of action thus\r\nsuggested are exactly suitable as tentative solutions for his problem.\r\nIn other instances, of course, only parts of the present situation are\r\nfound to be analogous to those previously encountered. Even then,\r\nhowever, the similarity of the facts may be helpful in providing\r\nsuggestions. Guidance based on limited or partial similarity has been\r\ndemonstrated to be better than purely intuitive thinking.\r\n\r\nThe commander cannot be content, however, to depend wholly on the\r\nguidance of the past. Sometimes, moreover, he may not be able to\r\nobtain suggestions by analogy. New suggestions, ideas not drawn from\r\npast experience, are very desirable; they are possible, also, in the\r\nsense that the result of the analysis of past experience may be\r\nreassembled, in imagination, in novel ways. New courses of action,\r\noverlooked in the past, may be contrived. Original combinations, not\r\npreviously entertained, may be devised. Readiness to employ the novel\r\nand the new, as well as to utilize the old, is a prime qualification\r\nfor command.\r\n\r\nReflective thinking of this nature requires adequate knowledge of the\r\ncapabilities of weapons, so that new possibilities may be perceived as\r\nto coordination in their use. While analogy looks backward to find\r\napplicable lessons, the search for novelty seeks suggestions from\r\npotentialities not heretofore utilized.\r\n\r\nThe development of the full possibilities of new weapons is an\r\nimportant source of forward thinking. Such thinking constantly\r\nintegrates the current developments in war. The competent commander\r\ndoes not wait for history to be made; he makes it.\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with experimentation, research, and new performance is\r\nalso a fruitful source of suggestions. When used, this method results\r\nin advance demands by the armed forces for new weapons not yet\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to analogy is the application of ordered and classified\r\nknowledge as to the nature of warfare. Aware of the effects which can\r\nbe brought about by the weapons at his disposal, the commander\r\nidentifies his objective with one or more of these effects.\r\n\r\nThe application of ordered and classified knowledge of naval warfare\r\nstarts, naturally, with a consideration of its objectives, and\r\nproceeds thereafter to the study of the various classes of operations\r\nwhich may be utilized to this end. Naval effort has as its objective\r\nthe keeping open of sea communications (see page 62). Command of the\r\nsea exists for one belligerent when he possesses and can exercise the\r\nability to move surface traffic, while also being able to prevent the\r\nenemy from doing so.\r\n\r\nNaval warfare, therefore, logically includes operations for the\r\npurpose of gaining, maintaining, or disputing command of sea areas,\r\nespecially under conditions where freedom of movement and the keeping\r\nopen of sea communications are of vital importance.\r\n\r\nSuch operations may be classified under the headings:\r\n\r\n    (1) For securing command of sea areas,\r\n    (2) In sea areas not under command, and\r\n    (3) In sea areas under command.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this classification, specific operations, broadly\r\nconsidered, appear to be limited in number. As to classification (1),\r\napplicable operations are: to destroy the enemy naval forces, to\r\ncontain them, or to divert them. For (2), applicable operations are:\r\nto raid, to make war against enemy trade, to attack or defend naval\r\nlines of communication, and to conduct amphibious warfare requiring\r\noverseas movement. For (3), applicable operations are: to blockade\r\ntrade, to defend own coastal and critical areas, to safeguard\r\nexpeditions against enemy territory, and to carry out offensive\r\noperations against enemy coastal objectives.\r\n\r\nManifestly, each such operation, broadly viewed, may be considered, in\r\nan estimate of the situation, as a course of action. Each such course\r\nof action (or operation) will involve, if developed into a more or\r\nless complete plan of action, numerous detailed operations which\r\nconstitute parts of the whole. (See page 37.)\r\n\r\nThere can be no rigid line of demarcation, always applicable, between\r\ncourses of action and the more detailed operations pertaining thereto.\r\nFor example, \"to raid\" may be, in one instance, an operation of such a\r\ncharacter, from the viewpoint of the commander, as to be envisaged,\r\ncorrelatively with \"to destroy\", as one of his courses of action. Yet,\r\nin another problem, a raid may be visualized, properly, as a detailed\r\noperation pertaining, in a subordinate capacity, to a more\r\ncomprehensive operation envisaged as a course of action \"to destroy\".\r\n\r\nSimilarly, what is a broad course of action from the viewpoint of one\r\nechelon in the chain of command, may be correctly viewed, on a higher\r\nechelon, as a detailed operation. Operations assigned in tasks imposed\r\nby higher authority become the basis for the determination of courses\r\nof action on the next lower echelon, a procedure which continues\r\nthroughout the chain of command until specialized, on the lowest\r\nechelons, in the form of a simplified routine (see page 84).\r\n\r\nWhile the list of courses of action given above is made up from the\r\nviewpoint of broad strategical problems, a similar list can be\r\nassembled for other problems. For example, the order, \"Destroy enemy\r\nnaval forces\", if taken as the motivating task of a tactical\r\nestimate, will be the basis for certain courses of action,\r\nconstituting, when complete (see below), a well-recognized general\r\nplan for a naval battle. This plan will in turn call for various\r\ndetailed operations on the part of the several subdivisions of the\r\nforce under the commander who makes the estimate (see page 95).\r\n\r\nAs a tentative solution of the problem a course of action may be\r\ncomplete or partial, i.e., it may, if carried out, provide for the\r\ncomplete attainment of the objective; or, such complete attainment may\r\nrequire a combination of several of the courses of action under study.\r\n\r\nThe exclusive consideration of courses of action of the complete type\r\npossesses the advantage of minimizing the total number of solutions\r\nunder study. This simplifies the procedure of analysis and of\r\ncomparing courses of action with each other, because of the relatively\r\nsmall number of courses to be tested and to be compared.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is frequently difficult, and sometimes impossible, to\r\nvisualize complete courses of action, especially during the early\r\nstages of the estimate. Sometimes the initial visualization of partial\r\ncourses and their eventual combination into a complete solution will\r\nbe found necessary.\r\n\r\nTherefore, either or both of the foregoing systems of formulating\r\ncourses of action may be found appropriate, according to individual\r\npreference and the nature of the particular problem.\r\n\r\nIndividuals, comparable with respect to knowledge, appear to vary\r\ngreatly in their ability to produce the appropriate suggestion, as to\r\ncourses of action, at the right time. The reason for this phenomenon\r\nis not altogether clear, but it is known that thinking seems to be\r\nlimited not merely by the range of knowledge, but by whatever part of\r\nit becomes available when needed. This point invites attention to\r\nanother procedure which is open to the commander with respect to\r\nstimulating reflective thinking. This procedure recognizes the fact\r\nthat, when two or more minds attack a problem, together, the combined\r\neffort often increases the applied mental power. This fact is\r\nuniversally recognized, for example, in the utilization of staff\r\nassistance (page 13).\r\n\r\nInherent and acquired ability have unquestionably much to do with the\r\npossibilities of visualizing single courses of action with respect to\r\ntheir completeness as to attainment of the objective. One method of\r\nvisualization seems to be the mental picturization of more or less\r\ndetailed operations, followed by their combination, through rapid\r\nsynthesis, into complete courses of action.\r\n\r\nAn example of this method would occur where several rather specific\r\noperations were visualized, involving seizure of certain localities as\r\na defensive measure. If it were then observed that the objective in\r\neach such case was \"denial to the enemy of a particular naval-base\r\nsite in the area ABCD\", an appropriate expression of a comprehensive\r\ncourse of action would be \"to deny the enemy naval-base sites in the\r\narea ABCD\".\r\n\r\nAnother method of visualizing appropriate courses of action seems to\r\ninvolve initial recognition, in the first instance, of such courses as\r\nbroad and comprehensive general plans, without first visualizing and\r\ncombining their details. This method appears to be more usual after\r\nconsiderable experience or training. It is therefore possible that\r\nthis second method is merely a practiced development of the first, the\r\nprocess of synthesis being so rapidly accomplished that it becomes\r\nsubconscious.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the particular problem has also an unquestioned bearing\r\non this subject. In instances where no single course of action can be\r\nfound which is adequately expressive of complete attainment of the\r\nobjective, the final selection of a method of attaining the objective\r\nwill necessarily be through a combination of the courses of action\r\nunder study (page 93).\r\n\r\nFor example, if the assigned task were to \"protect trade in sea area\r\nABCD\", the extent of the area, together with its geographical position\r\nrelative to locations from which enemy attacks could be launched,\r\nmight not be such as to permit the attainment of the objective by a\r\nsingle course of action such as \"to escort trade in convoys\" or \"to\r\npatrol the trade routes\". Both of these courses of action might be\r\nnecessary, and, in addition, perhaps, the further course \"to cover\r\nfocal points M and N\".\r\n\r\nEach of these courses of action has, as its objective, the\r\nestablishment of a protected area or areas, stationary or moving, for\r\nthe safe passage of merchant vessels. However, for purposes of\r\nexpressing the course of action involved, the contemplated procedure\r\nis in this case better indicated by a combination expressed in terms\r\nof action, the objective being inferred as a matter of mutual\r\nunderstanding. The less particularized expression of the course of\r\naction in terms of the objective would, in this instance, convey a\r\nless definite idea of the procedure under consideration.\r\n\r\nSimilar considerations pertain frequently to naval problems, more\r\nespecially to those involving naval engagements of considerable scope.\r\nThe solution of such a problem takes, typically, the form of an\r\noperation consisting, not of a single \"act\", but of \"a series of\r\nacts\", i.e., of a number of stages or phases of battle, each being a\r\npreparation for the one following, until the final stage provides for\r\nthe attainment of the assigned objective.\r\n\r\nFor example, a first consideration might be \"to reduce enemy carrier\r\naircraft strength by\" certain pertinent operations. A second\r\nconsideration might be \"to reduce enemy battle-line speed by\" certain\r\noperations in order to force the enemy to accept battle. A third might\r\nbe \"to reduce enemy battle-line speed, life, and hitting power by\r\ngunfire\" within certain range bands, in order to exploit own strength\r\nand enemy weakness at those ranges. A fourth might be \"to continue\r\nreduction of enemy battle-line strength by gunfire, closing to\" such a\r\nrange as is suitable to that end. Finally, a fifth consideration might\r\nbe \"to inflict conclusive damage on enemy battle-line with torpedoes\".\r\nAll of the foregoing partial courses (other possibilities having been\r\nstudied and discarded) might then be combined into one operation as\r\nthe selected course of action \"in order to destroy the enemy\r\nbattleship strength\",--such destruction being the assigned objective.\r\n\r\nThe degree of detail in which a course of action may be visualized for\r\npurposes of the estimate will vary with the same factors, i.e.,\r\npersonal facility and the nature of the problem. Practice in the\r\nsolution of problems appears to develop such facility that entire\r\nplans can be visualized as courses of action, each plan reasonably\r\ncomplete as to details with reference to physical objectives, relative\r\npositions, apportionment of fighting strength, and provision for\r\nfreedom of action. However, it is rarely, if ever, necessary to\r\nvisualize courses of action minutely in an estimate of a basic\r\nproblem; the extent to which they are viewed mentally, as detailed\r\nplans, need only be such as to fulfill the requirements of the\r\nparticular problem (see Section I of Chapter IV).\r\n\r\nThe statement of a course of action, for purposes of the estimate,\r\nwill naturally be along broad and comprehensive lines, although some\r\nimportant matters of detail (relatively speaking) may be added if this\r\nis found desirable as the estimate proceeds. It is with these\r\nconsiderations in mind that the standard practice has been developed\r\nof formulating courses of action, while under study as tentative\r\nsolutions of the problem, in broad terms, appropriate to general plans\r\nof action.\r\n\r\nThe commander may find, on occasion, what appears, on first\r\nexamination, to be an exception to the rule, herein treated as valid,\r\nthat a course of action, correctly conceived, always contains the two\r\nelements (1) objective, specific or inferred, and (2) action for its\r\nattainment. However, apparent exceptions to this principle are due to\r\nspecial conditions which, on proper analysis, reveal no actual\r\nexceptions. Certain examples, now to be discussed, demonstrate this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when the higher commander deems such procedure advisable\r\n(page 86), he may make his subordinate's estimate of the situation, as\r\nwell as his own, and may accordingly indicate both a task and a\r\npredetermined course of action for the subordinate to pursue: for\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n    \"Deny enemy base sites in area ABCD by capturing X Island.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a case the higher commander has indicated the predetermined\r\ncourse of action in the words \"by capturing X Island\". This expression\r\nindicates a specific objective, the capture of X Island. The\r\nexpression also indicates, though not in any detail, the action to be\r\ntaken, i.e., it specifies \"capture\", rather than \"occupation\",\r\n\"isolation\", or some other form of control (page 8). Any further\r\ndevelopment of the action is left for the subordinate to determine.\r\nThe procedure to be followed by the subordinate commander in solving\r\nsuch a problem is described hereafter (page 102) in the discussion of\r\nthe analysis of courses of action. In any event, it is manifest that\r\nthere is here no exception to the rule that a course of action,\r\ncorrectly conceived, contains the two elements of objective and action\r\nfor its attainment.\r\n\r\nA further example may occur when the higher commander, instead of\r\nindicating both the task and the predetermined course of action,\r\nindicates only the latter (page 86), by directing \"Capture X Island\".\r\nOnce the subordinate has recognized this directive as containing a\r\npredetermined course of action, but not a normal task, he realizes\r\nthat the objective so indicated would ordinarily be left for him to\r\nselect. He also realizes that the action to be taken for its\r\nattainment is left for him to determine, in further detail.\r\n\r\nIn this case, then, what is really a predetermined course of action\r\nappears in the guise of a task. When the commander, receiving the\r\ndirective, has recognized this fact, he proceeds in the manner\r\nhereafter indicated (page 103) in the discussion of the analysis of\r\ncourses of action.\r\n\r\nIn any event, it is manifest that here, also, there is no exception\r\nto the rule that a course of action, correctly conceived, contains the\r\ntwo elements of objective and action for its attainment.\r\n\r\nIn such a case as the foregoing, how does the commander recognize that\r\nthe apparent task is really a predetermined course of action? He could\r\neasily go astray because the directive, until analyzed, appears to\r\ncontain a normal task. The directive indicates an objective, thereby\r\nresembling a task. The directive will usually indicate, at least in\r\nsome degree, the action which the subordinate is to take. Hence, so\r\nfar as superficial appearance is concerned, the subordinate commander\r\nmay easily mistake the predetermined course of action for a normal\r\ntask. However, he discovers the difference when he endeavors to find\r\ncourses of action which are appropriate to this apparent task.\r\n\r\nThe commander will then discover that, while he can visualize actions\r\nwhose accomplishment will attain the objective indicated in the\r\napparent task, he cannot visualize any objective completely suitable\r\nto the case (page 93), intermediate between the assigned objective and\r\nthe indicated action. He can state the assigned objective in other\r\nwords and adopt such a statement as an expression of his general\r\nobjective, but the two objectives, the one he selects and the assigned\r\none, will really be identical.\r\n\r\nThis inability to visualize an objective of the commander's own\r\nselection, suitable to the case, is inevitable, because higher\r\nauthority has already done this for him. He may find it advisable to\r\ndevelop further the action needed for the attainment of the indicated\r\nobjective. On occasion this, also, will have been predetermined by the\r\nhigher commander.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations have been given special emphasis and\r\ndeserve careful study, because an appreciation of these facts is\r\nnecessary to a true understanding of the nature of correctly conceived\r\ncourses of action.\r\n\r\nAnalysis and Selection of Courses of Action. After one or more courses\r\nof action have been determined as tentative solutions of his problem,\r\nthe commander will be confronted with the necessity of deciding upon\r\nthat course of action, or combination of courses of action, which will\r\nbest attain the assigned objective, i.e., be the best way out of the\r\nseeming difficulty. The analysis, in each case, will settle\r\nsuitability on the basis of the appropriate effect desired,\r\nfeasibility on the basis of relative fighting strength as established\r\nby a survey of means available and opposed, influenced by the\r\ncharacteristics of the theater, and acceptability on the basis of\r\nconsequences as to costs.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these considerations, the detailed operations\r\ninvolved in each course will be analyzed so far as may be necessary\r\n(page 95) and with respect to correct physical objectives,\r\nadvantageous relative positions, proper apportionment of fighting\r\nstrength, and adequate freedom of action (see the Fundamental Military\r\nPrinciple--page 41). A selection shown to be best, from the standpoint\r\nof suitability, feasibility, and acceptability of the consequences,\r\nwill be adopted as the decision.\r\n\r\nThe tests of courses of action to determine whether they fulfill the\r\nrequirements of suitability, of feasibility, and of acceptability as\r\nto consequences take account of the usual included determinants as\r\nlisted and explained below. The list is not rigid, and the commander,\r\naccording to the nature of his problem, may desire to omit certain of\r\nthe items or to include any other considerations which may be\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to suitability, the commander considers the following:\r\n\r\n    (1) General. The test for suitability (see also page 31)\r\n    calls for conformity as to both the nature and the scope of\r\n    the motivating task. With respect to conformity in nature,\r\n    the test leads to a conclusion as to whether the course of\r\n    action, if carried out successfully, will or will not\r\n    contribute to the accomplishment of the task. As to scope,\r\n    the test leads to a conclusion as to whether the course of\r\n    action, if carried out successfully, will or will not\r\n    accomplish the task in full; and, if not in full, to what\r\n    extent. The factor of urgency is also considered here.\r\n\r\n    It is frequently possible for the commander, merely by\r\n    concentrating his thought on this particular perplexity, to\r\n    conclude at once that the course of action is suitable. In\r\n    other cases, a considerable amount of study may be needed.\r\n    This analytical study consists in breaking down the course of\r\n    action into its component parts, i.e., the detailed operations\r\n    which naturally grow out of it. This procedure is similar to\r\n    that described later (Chapter VII), with respect to\r\n    formulating a plan, but during the basic estimate the\r\n    procedure, when utilized, is for a different reason--solely\r\n    that of assisting in the analysis.\r\n\r\n    (2) Details, (a) Conformity as to nature. Will the course of\r\n    action, if successfully carried out, contribute, at least in\r\n    some degree, to the accomplishment of the task? If not, such a\r\n    course is rejected. Courses that do contribute, however, are\r\n    not rejected until the possibilities of combination have been\r\n    examined, later.\r\n\r\n    (b) Completeness. If the course of action is successfully\r\n    carried out, will it accomplish in full the motivating task?\r\n    If not, how much will it contribute towards such\r\n    accomplishment? With what other courses of action can it be\r\n    combined, to accomplish the motivating task in full? With what\r\n    others can it be combined to accomplish the motivating task in\r\n    part, and in such case how nearly does the combination\r\n    contribute to full accomplishment?\r\n\r\n    This examination may lead to combinations of certain partial\r\n    solutions.\r\n\r\n    (c) Desirability as to Urgency. The commander now considers\r\n    the element of time. Complete accomplishment of the motivating\r\n    task within his own theater may come too late to meet the\r\n    requirements of the common effort of the entire force.\r\n    Synchronization with the action of other task-group commanders\r\n    may be so important that timing becomes vital. As to this\r\n    consideration, two courses of action, equally competent, may\r\n    differ greatly in their qualification relating to urgency; one\r\n    may be found highly desirable and the other completely\r\n    unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nAs to feasibility, the commander considers the following:\r\n\r\n    (1) General. The test for feasibility (see page 31) is\r\n    concerned with whether the course of action is practicable.\r\n    Has it reasonable chances of success under the particular\r\n    circumstances? Are the difficulties surmountable? Is it\r\n    easily practicable, practicable with some difficulty, or very\r\n    difficult?\r\n\r\n    The commander, if he concludes that the course of action is\r\n    not a practicable one, rejects it from further consideration\r\n    in the estimate of the situation. However, care is taken at\r\n    this point not to dismiss, abruptly, courses of action which\r\n    may later be combined advantageously with one or more others.\r\n\r\n    Here, again, as noted for the suitability test, the commander\r\n    may sometimes profitably analyze the course of action by\r\n    breaking it down into more detailed operations.\r\n\r\n    As a result of the tests discussed above, the commander is\r\n    able to make a list of courses of action upon which his\r\n    confirmed judgment has bestowed the qualities of suitability\r\n    and feasibility.\r\n\r\n    He is also able to take stock to see how many of the solutions\r\n    are complete, how many are incomplete, and in the latter case\r\n    to what extent they constitute partial solutions. It is, of\r\n    course, desirable to have as many complete solutions as\r\n    possible, and at this point it may be possible to merge two or\r\n    more incomplete solutions into a single course of action which\r\n    better fulfills the test of suitability. The commander can\r\n    also take stock, similarly, of the degree of feasibility,\r\n    already referred to, as to the retained courses of action.\r\n\r\n    (2) Details, (a) Prospects of Success. Here the several courses\r\n    of action are considered relatively, with respect to the chance\r\n    of success in each. In the rating of courses on this basis,\r\n    the commander excludes consideration of losses except as they\r\n    may influence success or failure. He notes, however, his\r\n    considered expectations as to losses. Losses may appear to be\r\n    so great that success is doubtful. Certain courses of action\r\n    may be particularly vulnerable to enemy opposition because of\r\n    the types of weapons involved or because of favorable enemy\r\n    positions. Choice of such a course would permit the enemy an\r\n    initial advantage.\r\n\r\n    (b) Facility of Execution. This subject has to do with the\r\n    relative ease or difficulty of carrying out the several\r\n    courses of action. On the basis of the existing situation,\r\n    each course of action may be compared with all the others to\r\n    determine their relative merits with regard to the facility of\r\n    execution. Consideration is given to the action involved\r\n    against the several physical objectives; to the movements\r\n    needed in making new dispositions; to the relative adequacy of\r\n    the forces as to numbers and types of weapons; and to the\r\n    measures required for freedom of action.\r\n\r\n    A review of the previous discussion of these elements (Chapter\r\n    IV) may be very helpful in connection with this comparison. As\r\n    to freedom of action, for example, the commander may ask\r\n    himself which course is best from the standpoint of using the\r\n    initiative to advantage; and which course of action lends\r\n    itself best to the advantageous use of surprise. As the\r\n    commander reflects on these matters, other similar questions\r\n    may be suggested.\r\n\r\n    (c) Utilization of Own Strength and Exploitation of Enemy\r\n    Weakness. In his original visualization of each course of\r\n    action, the commander has naturally considered how to utilize\r\n    his own strength to best advantage, and how best to exploit\r\n    enemy weakness. In fact, especially in a detailed tactical\r\n    estimate, these considerations may have been predominant in\r\n    envisaging the courses of action. A careful evaluation of the\r\n    merits of each course of action in this respect is accordingly\r\n    necessary before a choice is made.\r\n\r\nWith regard to acceptability of consequences as to costs, the\r\ncommander considers the following:\r\n\r\n    (1) General. The process of putting a course of action to\r\n    proof as a tentative solution of the problem remains\r\n    incomplete until the course has been tested to determine its\r\n    consequences as to costs, so far as these can be visualized\r\n    in advance. The process involves an evaluation of the\r\n    diminution in total advantage which will result in the event\r\n    of failure, and a comparison of gains with losses in the\r\n    event of success. The situation to be expected, if the course\r\n    of action is carried out, is visualized in order to determine\r\n    the future effect on the creation or maintenance of an\r\n    ultimately favorable military situation.\r\n\r\n    In testing each course of action for acceptability as to its\r\n    consequences (page 31), the commander considers the cost of\r\n    success, the cost of failure, and the possible gain and loss\r\n    in perspective with the united effort as a whole. Questions\r\n    which he may pose include: If the course of action is\r\n    successful, will the costs be so prohibitive as to adversely\r\n    affect the successful accomplishment of the further effort? If\r\n    a tactical situation is under consideration, will the costs\r\n    prevent the accomplishment of the strategical aim? If the\r\n    course of action fails, what will be its effect? Will it cause\r\n    the entire plan to fail? Will its failure affect, for example,\r\n    the national morale?\r\n\r\n    If the command--and ultimately the State--can afford the\r\n    losses and other disadvantages which will be incurred as a\r\n    result of either the success or the failure of the\r\n    contemplated effort, a course of action may be considered as\r\n    acceptable from the standpoint of consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\n    As previously noted with respect to suitability, it may be\r\n    desirable to consider, with regard to consequences, the\r\n    detailed operations which may be involved in each course of\r\n    action.\r\n\r\n    Courses of action involving excessive consequences as to costs\r\n    are rejected. Notation is made of the relative degree of\r\n    acceptability, with respect to consequences as to costs, of\r\n    those courses of action which are retained.\r\n\r\n    (2) Details. (a) The Results of Success and of Failure. Each\r\n    course of action is examined to visualize the situation which\r\n    would be brought about for the commander and for the enemy in\r\n    case of success or of failure. The relative possibilities of\r\n    recovery toward a more favorable situation are weighed. This\r\n    consideration involves relative risks, for it may be that a\r\n    certain course, otherwise satisfactory, might entail\r\n    intolerable conditions should failure ensue.\r\n\r\n    The costs are measured in terms of fighting strength. It has\r\n    to be considered whether the sacrifices involved are worth the\r\n    gains which will follow; whether the objectives if attained\r\n    will be sufficiently valuable when the need of fighting\r\n    strength to accomplish further aims is considered.\r\n\r\n    (b) Comparison of gains and costs. When costs are found to be\r\n    in excess of the over-all gains, this fact may be the basis\r\n    for rejecting any courses of action which are less desirable\r\n    than others. However, retention of a course found to be costly\r\n    may be justified for sound reasons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen, as in the example given previously (page 96), the commander\r\nreceives a directive such as \"Deny enemy base sites in the area ABCD\r\nby capturing X Island\", he carries through his estimate of the\r\nsituation in the usual manner. He notes, however, that the capture of\r\nX Island has been indicated as a predetermined course of action. He\r\nmakes a proper survey of the factors of relative fighting strength. He\r\nconsiders all pertinent courses of action. He goes through this\r\nprocedure in order to reach an understanding of all the elements of\r\nhis problem. He wishes to understand the necessary background. He\r\nrealizes the importance of a grasp of the considerations which have\r\nled higher authority to arrive at the predetermined course of action.\r\n\r\nBy carrying through the usual estimate procedure, including the\r\nanalysis of all pertinent courses of action, he assists himself to\r\narrive at a proper concept of the action to be taken to capture X\r\nisland. In this way he establishes a sound basis for formulating a\r\ndetailed plan (in the second step), for inaugurating planned action\r\n(in the third step), and for supervising this action (in the fourth\r\nstep). He also establishes a basis for any constructive\r\nrepresentations which he finds it advisable to make to higher\r\nauthority (page 15).\r\n\r\nIn another example previously given (page 96), the higher commander\r\nindicates only the predetermined course of action (by a directive\r\n\"Capture X Island\") and omits the statement of the true underlying\r\ntask. The subordinate, on discovering this fact, deduces the\r\nunderlying task and carries through the estimate procedure, modified,\r\nas explained for the previous example. In addition to the merits as\r\npreviously stated, this method has a further advantage. The deduction\r\nof the underlying task enables the commander to judge whether any\r\nadvisable or necessary deviation or departure from the predetermined\r\ncourse of action (page 15) involves merely a variation from the letter\r\nof his instructions or, more important, from their spirit.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the directive, as in the case previously discussed, may\r\nhave been \"Capture X Island\". The higher commander when issuing this\r\norder, may have stated his own general plan to be \"This force will\r\nprotect the base at A.\" The commander, on receipt of this directive,\r\nthen deduces his true task. This is \"Deny enemy bases in area ABCD\"\r\n(\"by capturing X Island\"--a predetermined course of action), the\r\npurpose of the mission being \"in order to protect the base at A\".\r\n\r\nNow it may be found that the enemy, unconcerned as to X Island, is\r\nmoving to reinforce Y Island and to use it as a base to attack the\r\nbase at A. The commander then properly decides to capture Y Island,\r\ninstead of X Island. By his identification of the predetermined course\r\nof action as such, and by his correct deduction of the true underlying\r\ntask, the commander has established a sound basis for the solution of\r\nhis problem. He can now, with confidence, defer or abandon the capture\r\nof X Island, and can devote his efforts to the capture of Y Island.\r\nHis confidence is justified because he knows his decision to be in\r\naccordance with the spirit of his instructions.\r\n\r\nNaturally, if the higher commander directed, \"This force will protect\r\nthe base at A----\", and added, later in his directive, \"Deny enemy\r\nbase sites in area ABCD by capturing X Island\", the subordinate\r\ncommander's deductions would have been made more easily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe full play of the reasoning power is called for in the process of\r\nvisualizing courses of action and of selecting the best. This process\r\nis the crux of the first step. Here the knowledge of the relationship\r\nbetween cause and effect is applied. Here, also, the commander is\r\nbrought fully to realize that, to reach a sound decision, there is a\r\nrequirement for a studied development of each stage by which the human\r\nmind passes from recognition of a necessity for action to the ultimate\r\nconviction as to the best course to pursue.\r\n\r\nAs essential background for the utilization of his intellectual powers\r\nin this process, the commander requires knowledge of the capabilities\r\nand limitations of the technique of his profession and of the weapons\r\nof his calling. To the necessary knowledge gained through his own\r\nexperience, either in actual warfare or in peacetime exercises\r\nsimulating this experience, he adds the equally essential familiarity\r\nwith the science of war, and with the lessons to be drawn from\r\nhistorical instances of success and failure. In effect, it is here\r\nbrought home to him that, on a fundamental basis of earnest thought,\r\nmental ability, character, knowledge, and experience, finally rests\r\nthe soundness of decision (see page 219).\r\n\r\nThe Decision. The word \"decision\" has the primary meaning of a\r\nconclusion. A decision (conclusion) is essential as a starting point\r\nfor further procedure. Sound decision is the essential preliminary to\r\nwise planning and effective action.\r\n\r\nThe range within which military decisions may fall extends from the\r\ninstantaneous resolve to meet an emergency, to the conditional\r\nintentions of a distant future. Within this range will be found many\r\ndecisions which the commander is necessarily called upon to reach\r\nduring the four steps toward the attainment of an assigned objective.\r\n\r\nThe course of action, or the combination of courses, as finally\r\nselected by the commander upon the termination of the first step,\r\nrepresents his conclusion as to his outlined plan for the attainment\r\nof his assigned objective. This conclusion will indicate, specifically\r\nor inferentially, his general objective, as selected by himself,\r\nand--in proper detail--the action required for its attainment. (See\r\npages 88 and 95). The conclusion is thus his Decision, which provides\r\nthe general plan, or the basis therefor, from which he will, in the\r\nsecond step, develop a detailed plan of operations for his force.\r\n\r\nIllustration of the foregoing process may profitably be initiated with\r\nrespect to the highest echelon involved in the case of a State. The\r\nprimary national objective of organized government (Chapter I, page 7)\r\nis the ensurance of envisaged prosperity and of essential security for\r\nthe social system which is the fundamental basis of the community.\r\nThis aim, as embodied in basic policy (see pages 8 and 9), is the\r\nobjective visualized by the people of the State, or by its\r\npolicy-forming elements, in the capacity of an organized government.\r\n\r\nFor the maintenance of the condition represented in this policy, or\r\nfor the creation of such a condition not already existing, an\r\nappropriate task of the State, as the political embodiment of the\r\nnational will, might be to maintain or establish friendly (at least,\r\nnot hostile) governments and social systems in those key localities of\r\nthe world whence, otherwise, effective threats may arise.\r\n\r\nThe national mission (the mission of the State) then becomes:--\r\n\r\n    (Task) To maintain or establish friendly (at least, not\r\n        hostile) governments and social systems In those key\r\n        localities of the world whence, otherwise, effective\r\n        threats may arise,\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) in order to ensure envisaged prosperity and\r\n        essential security for the social system which is the\r\n        fundamental basis of the community.\r\n\r\nA national estimate of the situation, by the highest authority of the\r\nState, to determine the effect to be attained for the accomplishment\r\nof the foregoing mission, takes account of the possibilities of\r\naccomplishment through psychological, political, economic, or military\r\npressure, or by combinations thereof. As a result of this accounting,\r\nthe State adopts a national Decision which indicates the best way of\r\naccomplishing its mission.\r\n\r\nTo carry out this Decision, each of the primary subdivisions of the\r\nState's organization is assigned a specific task or tasks, whose total\r\neffect is designed to achieve the result embodied in the national\r\nDecision. The task of each such primary subdivision is linked to a\r\npurpose which is the attainment of the objective indicated in the\r\nnational Decision.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, each organization of the national armed forces is\r\ngoverned in its action by a task assigned to it as a result of a\r\nDecision made by the proper authority on the next higher echelon. Each\r\ncommander is thus provided with a mission which consists of an\r\nassigned task and of a purpose as indicated by the general objective\r\ndecided upon by his immediate superior.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Step\r\n\r\nThe second step, that of resolving the required action into detailed\r\nmilitary operations, may now be undertaken unless the Decision reached\r\nin the first step is intended for future reference only. During the\r\nsecond step the commander, if he carries the procedure through to its\r\nlogical end, visualizes his proposed operations as tasks, in order to\r\nensure their proper formulation. He may, if it is his intent to issue\r\na directive or directives for the execution of his plan of operation,\r\nor a part thereof, arrange his procedure so as to facilitate the third\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nThe common characteristic of problems of the second step is that they\r\ndeal with matters pertaining to the support of the action decided upon\r\nin the first step, and that they are properly problems for the\r\ncommander who made that Decision, and not for his subordinates, to\r\nsolve. Such problems are appropriately termed subsidiary problems.\r\nTheir full solution involves subsidiary estimates, subsidiary\r\ndecisions, and, not infrequently, distinct subsidiary plans and\r\nsubsidiary directives.\r\n\r\nEach detailed operation derived, during the second step, from the\r\noutlined plan of operations (as embodied in the basic Decision) is\r\ndetermined upon the basis of an estimate procedure essentially similar\r\nto the basic estimate. There is thus a series of subsidiary estimates\r\nfor this purpose. Such estimates tend to be abbreviated and informal,\r\nsince the necessary data, and often much of the consideration as to\r\nthe subsidiary courses of action, may be available from the basic\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\nUnless the detailed operations are of such a character as to require\r\ndevelopment into subsidiary plans as a basis for subsidiary\r\ndirectives, such operations are merely embodied, in the form of tasks\r\nor otherwise as may be appropriate, in the basic plan. In the excepted\r\ncases, where subsidiary plans, in detailed form, are necessary or\r\ndesirable, such a plan may be the result of a more formal and\r\nspecialized subsidiary estimate.\r\n\r\nChapter VII is devoted to a discussion of the second step.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe problem involved in the first step has been conveniently termed\r\nthe basic problem because it is directly concerned with the attainment\r\nof the assigned objective (page 81). The solution of the basic problem\r\nin the first step, and of its corollary in the second step, completes\r\nthe planning stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Step\r\n\r\nThe third step consists of the formulation, and--if appropriate--the\r\nissue, of the directives which convey to the subordinate the will and\r\nintent of the commander. From the mental standpoint, the third step\r\nbegins when the commander forms the intent of immediately promulgating\r\nhis directives for the execution of the planned action. Whether or not\r\nthe third step is partially combined with the second, its problem is a\r\nseparate one. Its complete solution inaugurates the action planned in\r\nthe second step.\r\n\r\nThe third step is discussed and developed in Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Step\r\n\r\nThe fourth step, which calls for mental effort in the solution of the\r\nproblem of supervising the action, requires a constant, close\r\nobservation of the unfolding of the original situation. The procedure\r\nemployed is customarily termed The Running Estimate of the Situation.\r\nOnly an alert commander can invariably determine whether the situation\r\nis unfolding along the lines desired by him, as promulgated in the\r\ndirectives of the third step. In effect, the commander, after action\r\nis begun, considers the changing situation as a variable in the\r\nproblem presented for his solution by the original (basic) situation.\r\nWith the march of events, he is, therefore, constantly critical to\r\ndetect whether variations from the original situation are in\r\naccordance with his design or whether these variations have introduced\r\nnew incentives which demand modification or alteration of his plan, or\r\nits complete abandonment.\r\n\r\nThe fourth step is discussed and developed in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSequence of Events in the Four Steps\r\n\r\nWhen all of the elements of the entire procedure of the four steps are\r\npresent, they take, from the viewpoint of the same commander\r\nthroughout, the following form:\r\n\r\n(1) First step: The commander, confronted with a strategical situation\r\n(page 83), makes a strategical estimate and comes to a strategical\r\nDecision. The problem, the estimate, and the Decision are basic.\r\n\r\n(2) Second step: The commander now is confronted with a particular\r\nproblem, one proceeding from his basic problem and involving the\r\ndetails of a plan of execution to carry out the Decision reached in\r\nthe first step; this problem consists, itself, of numerous other\r\nproblems of detail, which require solution by the commander himself.\r\nThe basic Decision has embodied an outlined plan, strategical in\r\nnature, for an operation to accomplish the motivating task of the\r\nfirst step. This plan requires resolution into the detailed operations\r\nnecessary for its full accomplishment.\r\n\r\nEach such detailed operation, as part of the outlined plan embodied in\r\nthe strategical Decision, calls for a proper estimate. Though usually\r\nnot formal in nature, more especially if the necessary data can be\r\nfound in the basic estimate, such estimates are fundamentally the same\r\nas for the basic problem. The assembly of such detailed operations\r\nresults in the formulation of a basic plan.\r\n\r\nAt this point, additional problems may present themselves, these being\r\nfrequently tactical in nature. Such, for example, may be sortie plans,\r\napproach plans, and Battle Plans. Other specialized plans (training,\r\nintelligence, logistics, etc.) may be needed. The data essential for\r\nthe solution of such problems are more detailed than for the usual\r\nstrategical basic problem. In some instances, such subsidiary plans\r\nmay be developed directly from the basic Decision by procedures\r\ndistinctive of the second step. In other instances, solution may\r\nrequire an additional subsidiary estimate, along the lines typical of\r\nthe first step. These subsidiary estimates lead to subsidiary\r\ndecisions, which in turn require to be resolved into the necessary\r\ndetailed operations.\r\n\r\n(3) Third step: In the third step, the directives, if the basic\r\nproblem was strategical in nature, will be of a strategical character.\r\nHowever, if subsidiary tactical problems were also involved, tactical\r\ndirectives will frequently be included. Logistics directives and other\r\nspecialized instructions may also be a feature.\r\n\r\n(4) Fourth step: The supervision of the planned action, in the fourth\r\nstep, may involve a new strategical problem, perhaps several. In such\r\nevent each new basic problem will initiate a new series of problems,\r\nwith corresponding directives, as described above. Changes in\r\nstrategical plans may be called for. If no strategical changes are\r\ninvolved, there may nevertheless be introduced one or more new\r\ntactical or logistics problems, with corresponding changes in the\r\nsubsequent procedure. The fourth step may, however, merely involve\r\nchanges in supporting plans (tactical, logistics, etc.), with\r\nresultant changes in the directives involved. Finally, the fourth step\r\nmay involve changes, for clarification, in the directives formulated\r\nin the third step.\r\n\r\nVariations in the foregoing procedure are frequent. The most usual is\r\nperhaps the case where the commander, receiving a tactical (instead of\r\na strategical) mission, solves such a tactical problem as a basic\r\nproblem in the first step; resolves his Decision into detailed\r\ntactical operations in the second step; issues a tactical directive or\r\ndirectives in the third step; and supervises his planned tactical\r\naction in the fourth step.\r\n\r\nPhraseology as to \"Course of Action\", \"Operation\", and \"Task\". It is\r\nimportant to avoid the possibility of becoming confused because each\r\nof the terms \"a course of action\", \"an operation\", and \"a task\", is\r\ncorrectly visualized as \"an act or a series of acts\". In the first\r\nstep, the selected course of action (see page 104) indicates the \"act\r\nor series of acts\" decided upon as representing, in general terms, an\r\neffort for attainment of a specified objective and is therefore stated\r\nas a comprehensive method of attaining that objective. The Decision\r\nthus adopts this course of action as a general plan of operations, or\r\nas a basis therefor.\r\n\r\nIn the second step, the required action is developed to place it upon\r\na practical, workable basis as a detailed plan to be executed. The\r\n\"act or series of acts\" represented by the selected \"course of action\"\r\nhas now become a detailed \"act or series of acts\". As such, it is now\r\nsusceptible of being assigned, in whole or in part, to subordinate\r\ncommanders as \"tasks\". The cycle within that particular echelon is\r\ncompleted when the tasks are thus assigned. The commander has thereby\r\ncharged his immediate subordinates with the commission of specific\r\n\"acts or series of acts\".\r\n\r\nEach such subordinate commander necessarily decides on the best method\r\nof accomplishing his assigned task, i.e., on the course of action (act\r\nor series of acts) which will best accomplish the effort required of\r\nhim. The procedure (for each commander on that echelon) thus begins\r\nanew until an echelon is reached where the character of the required\r\naction has already been determined as a matter of routine (see page\r\n84).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Use of a Form in the Solution of Problems\r\n\r\nThe natural mental processes (see page 19) are employed in all of the\r\nfour steps. The processes, in each step, require modification to an\r\nextent dependent upon the factors to be evaluated.\r\n\r\nA form has been adopted for the application of the mental processes in\r\nthe first step. This form, long known to the military profession as\r\nThe outline of The Estimate of The Situation (see Appendix), sets\r\nforth in a logical manner and order the several considerations likely\r\nto influence the selection of correct military objectives in problems\r\nof wide, as well as of lesser, scope. The use of this form is\r\nconducive to uniformity of reasoning. It centers the attention upon\r\nessentials, in order to ensure that no material factor bearing on the\r\nsolution of the problem is overlooked. It guides thought along a\r\nspecific path and, through the influence of suggestion, deliberately\r\nincreases the expenditure of mental effort.\r\n\r\nThe procedure indicated in the form contributes to the Decision\r\nreached as a result of an Estimate of the Situation, only to the\r\nextent that it provides an outline for, and encouragement of,\r\nsystematic analysis and reasoning.\r\n\r\nTo prove successful in stimulating rather than stifling creative\r\nthought, flexibility is a characteristic of any form capable of\r\napplication in such dissimilar circumstances as may be presented by\r\nthe varying scope of military problems. The Estimate Form is such a\r\nflexible guide. If a commander, in solving a problem, feels the need\r\nof greater flexibility, he may, of course, modify or adapt the form to\r\nhis particular needs. In so doing, however, he bears in mind that\r\ndeparture from orderly processes of reasoning, on which the form is\r\nbased, tends, through possible neglect of fundamental considerations,\r\nto lead to the omission of essential features of the analysis.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a rigid following of the form may frequently cause\r\nmuch repetition. This may be avoided, unless desired for emphasis or\r\nother appropriate reasons, by reference back to preceding portions of\r\nthe estimate. It is also to be noted, however, that the Estimate Form\r\nis adapted to a progressive procedure. Very frequently the earlier\r\nconsideration of some aspect of the problem can later be expanded both\r\nin scope and in proper detail by reason of additional information\r\nwhich has become available during the intervening stages of the\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between certain strategical and tactical problems\r\n(page 83) may introduce variations in the handling of the Estimate\r\nForm, and may affect the weight to be given the various factors. The\r\nuse of the Estimate Form, as described in Chapter VI, applies in full\r\nto problems which embrace the complete scope of broad strategical\r\nconcepts. It is suitable also for problems of limited scope, for which\r\ncertain modifications or abbreviations are required. When applied to\r\nproblems of a detailed tactical nature, the emphasis on the factors of\r\nfighting strength is somewhat different from that for strategical\r\nproblems. For certain subsidiary problems (page 106), the Form may be\r\nclosely applicable or may require considerable adaptation. In no case\r\nis it difficult to modify the Form to suit the requirements of the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of a relatively broad strategical situation may normally\r\nbe reduced to writing, because time is usually available. On the other\r\nhand, an estimate of a localized tactical situation frequently\r\nrequires almost instantaneous decision. Except in the preparation of\r\nplans to meet contingencies, such an estimate can rarely be given the\r\nelaborate form frequent in estimates of situations which are broadly\r\nstrategical in nature. When such tactical plans are prepared well in\r\nadvance of the event, the commander bases the estimate upon various\r\nassumptions as to the circumstances of a probable situation.\r\n\r\nThe written solution of tactical situations under various assumptions\r\nis a valuable feature of training to this end.\r\n\r\nDuring the second step, i.e., the resolution of the action, as\r\nembodied in the Decision, into the detailed operations required, the\r\nmethod considered most helpful is to arrange the procedure on the\r\nbasis of the salient features of a military operation (page 39 and\r\nSection III of Chapter IV). This procedure facilitates not only the\r\ndetermination of the necessary operations, but also the later\r\nformulation of directives.\r\n\r\nThe second step, like the first, makes use of the estimate procedure.\r\nThis is inevitable, in view of the fact that the mental processes are\r\nidentical (page 106) for the solution of the problem of both steps.\r\n\r\nThe application of the estimate procedure to the second step may be\r\ntested, aside from the logic of the theory involved, by careful\r\nanalysis of examples. For instance, if the basic Decision was to\r\ndetermine the location of enemy forces in the area ABCD, this becomes\r\nthe basis for a plan embodying the best method of determining the\r\nlocation of such enemy forces (an operation, or a series of\r\noperations). One method of procedure (course of action) to achieve\r\nthis objective may be to search the area by aircraft; another may\r\ninvolve a search by cruisers; another by destroyers; another by\r\nsubmarines; etc. The operation or operations finally determined upon\r\nmay be any one of these, or a combination of two or more of them,\r\nperhaps of all of them. The fundamental procedure leading to this\r\nconclusion is identical with that of the basic estimate.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of possible variations of the fundamental mental\r\nprocesses applicable to the second step, according to the facility and\r\nthe preference of the commander. Practice seems to develop such\r\nfacility (see also page 94) that entire plans, each properly\r\nintegrated with respect to physical objectives, relative positions,\r\napportionment of fighting strength, and freedom of action, may be\r\nvisualized separately from each other.\r\n\r\nAt the other extreme, the elementary procedure is to utilize these\r\nsalient features of such a plan, successively, to suggest detailed\r\noperations. The features after the first are then used either to adapt\r\nor to complete the operations suggested by preceding features, or to\r\nsuggest new operations. This elementary procedure, being the simpler\r\nand more methodical of the two, is the one explained hereafter\r\n(Chapter VII).\r\n\r\nHowever, there are various possibilities as to procedures intermediate\r\nbetween these extremes. One such procedure would visualize operations\r\nprimarily on the basis of correct physical objectives, adapting and\r\ncompleting such operations by reference to the other features; the\r\nprocedure would then utilize relative positions, etc., to suggest\r\nadditional operations, which in turn may be similarly adapted or\r\ncompleted. The commander is of course at liberty to use the procedure\r\nbest suited to his own working methods and to the particular\r\nsituation; naturally, he bears full responsibility for any errors due\r\nto a faulty choice of procedure.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the exercise of mental power in the solution of\r\nmilitary problems, the second step may be taken to include the\r\nassembly of the commander's conclusions in the form of directives. The\r\nthird step begins, however (page 107), when the commander forms the\r\nintent of immediately promulgating such directives.\r\n\r\nThe third step makes use of the Order Form. In our naval service, this\r\nform is applicable, with certain modifications, to all written\r\ndirectives pertaining to operations other than routine. The subject\r\nmatter is presented in a logical sequence which experience has shown\r\nto be effective. The Order Form assists in the solution of the problem\r\nby providing a comprehensive vehicle with which all echelons are\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth step, i.e., the supervision of the planned action, the\r\nprime essential is the maintenance by the commander of a Running\r\nEstimate (page 107). For this purpose there is a definite technique of\r\nwhich the Estimate Form provides the basis, and by means of which the\r\nsolution of this important problem is aided.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion As To the Approach to the Solution of Military Problems\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations indicate that planned attainment of a\r\nmilitary objective requires the application of mental effort in four\r\ndistinct steps.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of the four steps necessarily is fixed because of the\r\nconsequential relationship among the problems typical of the several\r\nsteps. The mission, in the first step, furnishes the nature of the\r\nappropriate effect desired. Until modified or revoked by higher\r\nauthority, it clearly remains the governing influence throughout the\r\nentire range of mental effort which, in conjunction with the moral and\r\nphysical effort, is calculated to result finally in the attainment of\r\nthe assigned objective.\r\n\r\nThe procedure involved, being natural and universal, is fundamentally\r\nthe same even in those tactical situations where the commander\r\nperforms all of the steps in almost instantaneous succession. The\r\nEstimate Form, as presented herein, is adaptable to military problems\r\nof any nature. The systematic approach represented in the Form is\r\nsubject to adaptation by the competent commander--provided that the\r\nessentials are preserved--in any manner appropriate to his personal\r\npreference and to the nature of his particular problem.\r\n\r\nThe essentials of the military Estimate of the Situation, as a\r\nspecialized use of the natural mental processes, are inherent in the\r\nproper application of the Fundamental Military Principle (see page\r\n82). The Estimate Form merely provides a more detailed guide for the\r\nuse of the Principle. Facility in the use of the Principle will enable\r\nthe competent commander, once he has formed a proper understanding of\r\nthe basis for solution of a problem, to solve the problem correctly\r\nwithout reference to the Estimate Form. Reference to the Form may be\r\nnecessary in problems of broad scope, in order to ensure a complete\r\nsurvey of factors of fighting strength. Time, in such cases, is\r\nusually available for purposes of a detailed study. Subject to this\r\nexception, the Principle, alone, may be used effectively as a basis\r\nfor sound military decision,--a fact of particular significance where\r\ntime (page 22) is an element of immediate concern.\r\n\r\nThat this procedure may be successfully and repeatedly applied in the\r\nfast-moving events of the decisive tactical engagement is, more\r\nparticularly, the goal of mental preparation for the exercise of\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE EXERCISE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT\r\nIN PLANNING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SELECTION OF A CORRECT OBJECTIVE\r\n\r\n(Including the Determination, in Proper Detail, of the Action Required\r\nfor its Attainment)\r\n\r\nThe First Step--The Solution of a Basic Problem (The Estimate of the\r\nSituation)\r\n\r\n    The type of problem distinctive of the first step, now to be\r\n    discussed, is a basic problem. It is the most likely type when\r\n    an organized chain of command is in effective operation, the\r\n    incentive for solution being derived from a directive issued\r\n    by higher authority (Chapter V).\r\n\r\n    The problem of the first step is described by the question,\r\n    \"What objective should I select, and what action (in outline)\r\n    should I take for its attainment, in order to achieve the\r\n    objective assigned to me by higher authority?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe procedure for solution of the type of problem distinctive of the\r\nfirst step is that already indicated as applicable to all military\r\nproblems, i.e., a specialized employment of the natural mental\r\nprocesses (Chapter II) through the application of the Fundamental\r\nMilitary Principle. The studied application of the Principle is\r\nassisted through the Estimate Form which provides a more detailed\r\nguide.\r\n\r\nThe fundamentals of the Estimate Form have already been discussed\r\n(Chapter V). Except for emphasis, or to afford a basis for further\r\ndetailed discussion, the basic matters previously dealt with are not\r\nrepeated in the present chapter. It is therefore advisable, before\r\nstudying the details applicable to the first step, to make an adequate\r\nreview of the pertinent portions of the preceding chapter. With the\r\nnecessary background thus provided, the Estimate Form can be followed\r\nwith a minimum of distraction caused by reference to related subjects.\r\n\r\nFor special emphasis, it is repeated here (see also page 110) that the\r\nEstimate Form is a flexible guide. The commander is of course at\r\nliberty to vary the procedure according to his particular needs and\r\nthe nature of his problem; however, he will bear in mind that errors\r\nof commission or of omission arising by reason of departure from the\r\nessential features of the procedure may disrupt orderly reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe Estimate Form is divided into sections and sub-sections, each of\r\nwhich presents a subject for consideration. The Form follows,\r\nsequentially, the salient features of the natural mental process\r\ndescribed in Chapter II. It will be seen, from an examination of the\r\nsection headings listed below, that Section I has to do with\r\nestablishing the basis for solution of the problem; Sections II, III,\r\nand IV relate to the actual process of solution through consideration\r\nof various courses of action; while Section V states the conclusion\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n    I. Establishment of the Basis for Solution of the Problem.\r\n\r\n    II. Determination of Suitable, Feasible, and Acceptable\r\n        Courses of Action.\r\n\r\n    III. Examination into the Capabilities of the Enemy.\r\n\r\n    IV. Selection of the Best Course of Action.\r\n\r\n    V. The Decision.\r\n\r\nA tabular form inserted in the Appendix lists the foregoing headings\r\nand their principal subdivisions within the Estimate Form. For\r\nconvenience, the appended Form also includes page references to the\r\ndiscussion in this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE BASIS FOR SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM\r\n\r\nAs noted in the Fundamental Military Principle, each objective, prior\r\nto its selection, and each operation, prior to its adoption, requires\r\nexamination from the standpoint of suitability, feasibility, and\r\nacceptability. Suitability involves the factor of the appropriate\r\neffect desired; feasibility involves the factors of the means\r\navailable and opposed, as influenced by the characteristics of the\r\ntheater; and acceptability involves the factor of the consequences as\r\nto costs.\r\n\r\nIn order to establish a sound basis for the solution of a military\r\nproblem, one which will permit the tests for suitability, feasibility,\r\nand acceptability (see pages 98-102) to be intelligently applied, it\r\nis necessary that the factors involved be studied.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. The Appropriate Effect Desired.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate effect desired, the first factor listed, is the goal\r\ntoward which the commander is working. He is enabled to form an\r\nunderstanding of this essential aspect of his problem through (1) a\r\ngrasp of the salient features of the situation, (2) a recognition of\r\nthe incentive to solution, and (3) an appreciation of the assigned\r\nobjective. He expresses this understanding by (4) formulating the\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nThe sequence in which the commander takes up these considerations is a\r\nmatter for his own choice. Usually, directives from higher authority\r\n(see Chapter VIII as to the Order Form) give him, first, information\r\nas to the situation; thereafter, such directives assign him a task (or\r\ntasks) involving one or more assigned objectives. For this reason, the\r\nsequence so indicated is the one utilized here.\r\n\r\n(1) Summary of the Situation. Before the commander can decide whether\r\nhe wishes to maintain the existing situation or to change it, he\r\nrequires a mental picture of its salient features. On beginning the\r\nEstimate, the available information is therefore briefly summarized.\r\nThe picture presented here will show in broad outline (page 79) the\r\nopposing forces as disposed in localities which constitute relative\r\npositions with reference to each other. Details are reserved for\r\nSection I-B of the Estimate.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate data are noted on the chart, and study of the chart\r\ngoes hand in hand with the development of the Estimate.\r\n\r\nThe summary of the situation may include statements as to present\r\nactivities of own and enemy forces. It may recite significant\r\noccurrences. It does not attempt to compare or to deduce; such\r\nprocesses are deferred until Section I-B. The commander extracts, from\r\nthe information furnished by higher authority, such data as are\r\npertinent to his own problem. He includes these data in his own\r\nsummary, supplementing them by information from other sources, to the\r\nextent deemed advisable. In the exercise of judgment as to the content\r\nof his summary, the commander is influenced by the fact that the\r\nsummary is the point of departure for visualizing the appropriate\r\neffect desired.\r\n\r\n(2) Recognition of the Incentive. In basic problems (the type now\r\nunder discussion, see page 117), the commander finds his incentive in\r\ndirectives received from higher authority. Under the procedure of the\r\nEstimate, a notation of that fact, with a citation of the\r\ndirective(s), is all that is required to indicate that the commander\r\nhas formed a proper recognition of his incentive.\r\n\r\n(3) Appreciation of the Assigned Objective. A correct understanding of\r\nthe nature and of the involvements of the assigned objective is,\r\nnaturally, an essential to the establishment of the basis for the\r\nsolution of a problem of the first step.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the Estimate the commander cannot, however, expect\r\nalways to reach a final conclusion as to this matter. He will have\r\nopportunity for further consideration, later, in Section II. It will\r\nbe realized that, after intervening portions of the Estimate have been\r\nworked out, the commander will be in a position to examine the\r\nassigned objective again, and to make a more thorough analysis.\r\n\r\nIn a basic problem, the commander is assigned his objective by higher\r\nauthority, usually in the form of an assigned task. Although, as\r\nstated on page 84, such task may be expressed by one of various\r\nmethods, a properly conceived task always indicates, either\r\nspecifically or inferentially, an objective (or objectives).\r\n\r\nWhatever method of expression may have been employed by higher\r\nauthority, the commander will facilitate his appreciation of the\r\nassigned objective if he now sets down his assigned task, scrutinizes\r\nit carefully, and then makes note of the objective which is either\r\nspecifically or inferentially indicated by that task. (See pages\r\n52-54).\r\n\r\nThe commander's basis for solving the problem is not complete,\r\nhowever, with merely a statement of his own objective. Full\r\nvisualization of the effect desired is not obtained until the\r\ncommander appreciates not only the result which he, himself, is\r\nrequired to accomplish, but also the next further result which is\r\nexpected to eventuate as, at least in part, an effect of his\r\naccomplishment. His goal, as an \"effect desired\", includes not only\r\nthe effect desired of him by higher authority, but also the effect\r\nwhich his immediate superior desires to be accomplished by that\r\nsuperior's entire force.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, full appreciation of the commander's objective will\r\nrequire, also, consideration of the further effects desired by yet\r\nhigher successive echelons.\r\n\r\nThe natural requirement is that the goal be so clearly defined as to\r\nobviate any material doubt as to the implications involved in the\r\ncommander's assigned objective. When the goal has been thus defined,\r\nthere results a linking of effect and further effect, of objective and\r\nfurther objective,--in short, of task and purpose,--the importance of\r\nwhich has previously been emphasized (page 48).\r\n\r\nIn making notation of this further objective for the solution of\r\nproblems typical of the first step, the commander normally sets down\r\nthe general plan of his immediate superior for the employment of the\r\nlatter's entire force. When the linking of objective to objective,\r\nechelon by echelon, has involved no complication, the immediate\r\nsuperior's general plan will be a sufficient indication of the\r\npurpose for which the commander is to carry out his task.\r\n\r\n(4) Formulation of the Mission.\r\n\r\nThe linking of the commander's assigned task to the general plan of\r\nhis immediate superior permits the commander to formulate his mission\r\n(page 87). His assigned task becomes the task of his mission; his\r\nsuperior's general plan becomes the purpose of his mission. In this\r\nmanner he crystallizes into a clear statement the part of the common\r\neffort which he is to carry out, indicating the assigned objective he\r\nis himself to attain, as well as the further objective to whose\r\nattainment his effort is to contribute.\r\n\r\nIn establishing the basis for solution of his problem with respect to\r\nsuitability, the commander may have considered his assigned objective\r\nbefore studying his situation. If so, he may now desire to modify his\r\nearlier statement of that objective, before incorporating it in the\r\nformulation of his mission, to the end that a more clear-cut and\r\nconcise expression may be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe relationship (restated from page 87 for emphasis) is expressed in\r\nthe following;\r\n\r\n    My assigned task is to be accomplished for the purpose of\r\n    carrying out my designated part of my superior's general plan.\r\n\r\nThis formula is customarily simplified to the following:\r\n\r\n    (Task) (statement of the assigned task),\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) in order to assist in the successful execution of\r\n    (statement of the superior's general plan).\r\n\r\nThe words \"assist in the successful execution of\" may frequently be\r\nunderstood and therefore omitted.\r\n\r\nThe mission, thus formulated, clearly indicates the appropriate effect\r\ndesired, i.e., the factor which establishes the basis for the solution\r\nof the problem from the standpoint of suitability.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Relative Fighting Strength.\r\n\r\nAs indicated in the Fundamental Military Principle, the second and\r\nthird requirements for a sound solution of the problem are feasibility\r\nof accomplishment and acceptability of the consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\nBoth requirements have to do with the factors of relative fighting\r\nstrength. Fighting strength is derived from the means available as\r\ninfluenced by the characteristics of the theater. Relative fighting\r\nstrength is determined by a weighing of these factors against the\r\nmeans opposed, as influenced also by the characteristics of the\r\ntheater.\r\n\r\nThese are the factors, then, which are next studied in the Estimate.\r\nThey are studied in order to complete the establishment of the basis\r\nfor the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe factor of consequences, as listed in the Fundamental Military\r\nPrinciple, is related to the factors pertinent to feasibility. This is\r\ntrue because consequences are assessed, in the Estimate, on the basis\r\nof the envisaged results of proposed actions. These results are\r\nnecessarily predicated on the grounds established by consideration of\r\nthe factors of relative fighting strength. The study of relative\r\nfighting strength thus provides not only a sound basis for the\r\ndetermination, later, of the feasibility of courses of action, but\r\nalso of their acceptability with respect to consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\nParticular emphasis is placed on the conclusion as to relative fighting\r\nstrength, to the end that specific advantages may be ascertained. Such a\r\nstudy is primarily concerned with information:--its collection, its\r\nanalysis, its evaluation, and its interpretation so as to convert it\r\ninto military (naval) intelligence (page 76), with a view to its use by\r\nthe commander in the solution of his problem. Information as to forces\r\npresent and as to their positions is of course prerequisite to a clear\r\ncomprehension of the possibilities as to physical objectives, as to\r\nrelative positions, as to apportionment of fighting strength, and as to\r\nfreedom of action.\r\n\r\nThe commander may choose whether he shall, in his estimate, first\r\nconsider the means available and opposed, or reverse the order and\r\ngive priority to the characteristics of the theater. In a particular\r\nsituation, the significance of these characteristics is frequently\r\ndetermined by the capabilities and limitations of the means available\r\nand opposed. For this reason, these means are first discussed in this\r\ntreatment, which thereafter includes the analysis of the\r\ncharacteristics of the theater.\r\n\r\nThe capabilities and limitations of the means, and the significance of\r\nthe characteristics of the theater, may be expressed in terms of\r\ncertain specific factors (page 25). Each of these factors may\r\ninfluence, or be influenced by, any or all of the others. Situations\r\noccur in which certain factors exert little or no influence. Yet, in\r\nother situations, these same factors have a paramount effect.\r\n\r\nThe classification of factors utilized in the following treatment is\r\napplicable to most military problems.\r\n\r\nA list of pertinent factors, to be of real use in the solution of\r\nproblems, is required, first, to be complete, so that no factor will\r\nbe overlooked, and, second, to be simple, so that, as far as\r\npracticable, all similar data may be discussed under one heading.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the factors set forth in succeeding pages, the\r\nsolution of a particular problem may call for a different listing.\r\n\r\nSuch listing may involve, in some cases, the contraction or the\r\nomission of certain of the headings.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, an expansion will be necessary or desirable under\r\ncertain headings, in considerably greater detail than shown here. For\r\nexample, Section I-B of a National Estimate may involve reference to\r\nseveral volumes of printed books or of similar data, while, even in\r\nordinary strategical situations, numerous charts, books of sailing\r\ndirections, and other compilations may require study. Where such\r\nreferences are not standard and generally available, they may be\r\nappended, preferably in condensed form.\r\n\r\nThe proper listing of pertinent factors will depend on the nature of\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Survey of the Means Available and Opposed.\r\n\r\nThe application of power, actually or by threat, is dependent on the\r\nability of the human and material components of fighting strength to\r\ndevelop energy and to exert effort for purposes of combat (page 8).\r\nThese components, as ranged on one side or the other, constitute the\r\nmeans available and opposed. (See page 31). Analysis of these means\r\nrequires a classification of the various factors which influence the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nFor a broad strategical estimate made by the State, economic and\r\npolitical factors require intensive study; physical objectives,\r\nrelative position, apportionment of fighting strength, and freedom of\r\naction are all involved in such a survey.\r\n\r\nFor a strategical estimate made by a high military commander, these\r\nfactors frequently enter to a lesser extent. Such a commander is\r\nconcerned only with the effect which these factors will have on the\r\noperations projected for the particular theater involved in his\r\nproblem. From his point of view, the economic and political factors\r\noften have little bearing on the elements of a favorable military\r\nsituation. In such a case, the commander concentrates in this section\r\non the factors more directly relating to the armed forces; his\r\nimportant considerations deal with such matters as numerical\r\nstrength, types of weapons, disposition, and factors as to freedom of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nFor strategical estimates of lesser scope, the commander further\r\nrestricts his study accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn detailed tactical estimates the commander requires an exhaustive\r\ncomprehension of the fighting capabilities of his own and the enemy\r\narmed forces, because his selection of physical objectives and his use\r\nof relative position are affected by such considerations. This is\r\nmanifestly true for studied tactical estimates made in advance to meet\r\ncontingencies, but its import is not always fully understood in its\r\nbearing on the unfolding situation after the battle begins. At that\r\ntime, the most precise knowledge is called for, under the then rapidly\r\nchanging conditions. (Chapter IX.)\r\n\r\nIn the Form treated herein, those matters particularly applicable to\r\nbroad estimates are included under \"general factors\". These are\r\nfollowed by the factors more directly applicable to the armed forces.\r\n\r\n(a) General Factors. (i) Political Factors. The prosecution of the war\r\nis directly influenced by such internal conditions as the strength of\r\nthe national government and its capacity for unified effort, the\r\nmoulding and maintaining of a firm public opinion in support of war\r\naims, the neutralization of subversive propaganda, and the degree to\r\nwhich the government can make available necessary resources, both\r\ndomestic and foreign.\r\n\r\nExternal relations modify the conduct of war, always affecting broad\r\nestimates of the employment of national forces. The wartime factors\r\nwhich influence these relations include the effect of the clash\r\nbetween foreign opinion and national policy, the national bias of\r\ninterested neutrals and of unneutral non-belligerent governments, and\r\nthe normal attitude of such neutrals and non-belligerents toward each\r\nbelligerent. The diplomatic skill of the opposing governments and the\r\nability of propaganda to sway public opinion abroad may well determine\r\nthe manner in which neutrality will be enforced.\r\n\r\nAlliances, including those that are known and those that are secret,\r\ndirectly influence an estimate. When a war of any importance breaks\r\nout in any part of the world, all States are affected to some degree.\r\nOne may have an alliance which, though not requiring active\r\nparticipation in the war, will call for collaboration with the efforts\r\nof a belligerent. Another alliance may require active participation,\r\nwhile still another State may attempt to maintain strict neutrality.\r\nEvery State remaining at peace will thus be in a status ranging from\r\nthat of a non-belligerent, with more or less close ties to one of the\r\ncontestants, to a position of strict impartiality. The estimate of the\r\ninternational situation becomes more complex as the magnitude of the\r\nwar increases. A correct appreciation of the status of each State\r\nconcerned is of first importance in any broad estimate of the conduct\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n(ii) Economic Factors. The capacity, organization, and mobilization of\r\nindustry influence the rapidity and adequacy with which material is\r\nprepared for, and supplied to, the armed forces. The acceptance by the\r\ncivilian population of sacrifices, caused by the diversion to war uses\r\nof the productive capacity of industry, will have a direct bearing\r\nupon the industrial capacity of that State.\r\n\r\nThe ability and willingness to finance the war effort, which includes\r\nthe ability to tax, to float internal loans, and to create foreign\r\ncredits, may well determine the extent and duration of the national\r\ncapability for war.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of a nation upon the continuation of foreign trade,\r\nincluding the necessity of obtaining new markets and new sources of\r\nsupply, affects its strength. No State yet has complete autarchy.\r\nThus, there is the necessity of obtaining from foreign sources certain\r\nof the raw materials which are indispensable to the war effort. As\r\neach belligerent may endeavor to deny sources of raw materials to the\r\nother, a portion of the fighting power may be required for trade\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n(iii) Psychological Factors. The maintenance of a stable morale (page\r\n72) at a high level is a primary concern. Such stability inures the\r\nnation or command against the full effects of surprise, fear,\r\ndisappointment, despondency, and other weakening moral influences,\r\nwhile at the same time taking full advantage of those influences which\r\nstrengthen the moral fiber of a people.\r\n\r\nTraining and experience influence morale, playing a part difficult to\r\noverestimate. They provide a basis for evaluating discipline. A study\r\nof the history of the State may prove valuable in estimating the\r\npresent condition in this respect; a nation or command which may be\r\nclassed as a veteran has an advantage over a beginner at the art of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor relates to the existence of the skills\r\nnecessary for the production and use of the material means of war. The\r\ncontrol of skilled personnel is a psychological consideration of\r\ngreat importance.\r\n\r\nUnity of effort, or the lack of it, especially between management and\r\nlabor, may be one of the most important factors of the estimate.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention is desirable as to national inventiveness and\r\nversatility in the production of new and surprising means of war or in\r\ndevelopment of methods that in any way contribute to a successful war\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nRacial or national characteristics may affect the estimates of morale\r\nand training. Reactions of various races or groups to the conditions\r\nof war have been sufficiently recorded, on the basis of past\r\nperformance, to prove of some value. Service traditions may furnish\r\nclues for correct evaluation of psychological factors.\r\n\r\nWhile only the physical elements of fighting strength are susceptible\r\nof quantitative comparison, failure to take account of mental and\r\nmoral factors may involve serious error. Nevertheless, in many\r\nsituations, such factors remain relatively indeterminate until\r\nsubjected to test. Inferences may be drawn, and deductions made, on a\r\nbasis of peace-time observation and of historical precedent. In these,\r\nracial and national characteristics may figure prominently. History,\r\nhowever, has taught that, in a conflict between modern industrial and\r\nmilitary nations, it is unwise to entertain any assumption other than\r\nthat of moral equality until such time as the conflict has\r\ndemonstrated the existence of a difference, and the degree thereof, or\r\nunless prior experience, observation, and acquaintance unquestionably\r\nwarrant otherwise.\r\n\r\n(iv) Information and counter-information measures. Operations of war\r\nare tremendously affected by the information which each belligerent\r\npossesses of the others. It is therefore of vital importance to weigh\r\nthe efficiency of the belligerents in the employment of means of\r\nobtaining, denying, and utilizing information.\r\n\r\nThere may appropriately be considered present, probable, or possible\r\nuse or non-use of indirect methods such as: study of press, captured\r\ndocuments, and material; reports from other friendly units;\r\ninterrogation of prisoners of war, deserters, inhabitants, and escaped\r\nor exchanged prisoners; radio direction-finding; efficiency of\r\ncryptography; interception of enemy radio, telegraph, telephone, and\r\nmail communications; espionage; censorship; propaganda; efficiency of\r\ncommunications systems, ashore and afloat, which include all means of\r\ninterchange of thought. In this connection it will be recalled that\r\ninformation, however accurate and appropriate, is useless if it cannot\r\nbe conveyed in time.\r\n\r\nThe direct methods of obtaining information are military operations\r\nintended for that purpose, such as observation, reconnaissance,\r\nscouting, trailing.\r\n\r\nCounter-information measures are no less important than those\r\npertaining to collection of information. Such measures include all\r\nprovisions for secrecy, such as censorship, counter-espionage,\r\ncryptography, control of own communications, security of documents,\r\ncamouflage, and applicable tactical operations.\r\n\r\n(b) Factors More Directly Applicable to Armed Forces, (i) Vessels,\r\nincluding aircraft. The numbers and characteristics, of the ships and\r\naircraft of the various nations of the world are known with less and\r\nless accuracy from the time when war becomes a probability. The\r\ninformation available is given intense and comparative scrutiny, under\r\nthe specific headings of the factors of the Estimate Form as later\r\nenumerated.\r\n\r\n(ii) Land forces, including land-based aviation. Important facts\r\nconcerning the land forces of the enemy, including his land-based\r\naviation, will be known, probably, to a lesser extent than in the case\r\nof the naval forces. The value of a comparison--naval, land, or\r\nair--may depend upon whether the intelligence service has improved the\r\naccuracy of these data, maintained them up to date, and collected\r\naccurate additional information.\r\n\r\n(iii) Personnel. The status of enemy personnel as to the sufficiency\r\nof numbers effectively to man all implements, as to training, morale,\r\nskill, stamina, and willingness to accept the supreme sacrifice, can\r\nseldom be accurately known. Unless there is positive information to\r\nthe contrary, the wise commander will assume in this respect that the\r\nstatus of the personnel available to his opponent is at least equal to\r\nthat of his own command. Full consideration will be given to all known\r\nfacts concerning own personnel, to the end that its worth in any\r\nproposed situation may be properly evaluated.\r\n\r\nThe basic discussion of the psychological factors (page 125) is\r\napplicable here as to the respective armed forces. Personal\r\ncharacteristics of commanders, so far as known, deserve full study,\r\nsince they have an important bearing on relative fighting strength.\r\nThe military value of the various units and forces is a similar\r\nconsideration. The present attitude and past actions of enemy\r\ncommanders and of their commands, and the factor of racial, national,\r\nand service characteristics, may furnish clues for correct evaluation\r\nin this connection.\r\n\r\n(iv) Material. The material characteristics of the commander's own\r\nimplements of war are generally known to him. The characteristics of\r\nenemy material can only be estimated from such data as have become\r\navailable, but are not to be underestimated.\r\n\r\nMaterial characteristics embrace armament, life, and mobility.\r\n\r\nArmament relates to the caliber and number of guns, and to other\r\nweapons such as torpedoes, mines, depth-charges and aircraft (with\r\ntheir own weapons). It also includes chemical agents and other\r\ninstrumentalities, together with the types, potentialities as to\r\nrange, and the number or amount of each available, both for immediate\r\nuse and as replacements. Ammunition supply is a factor here. In the\r\nevaluation of foreign armaments, sufficient data are often available\r\nto make a reasonable estimate, but care is desirable not to\r\nunderestimate.\r\n\r\nLife is the ability to withstand punishment; it is expressed in terms\r\nof standards which can be clearly visualized. For a vessel, life is\r\nthe ability to absorb damage while carrying out its assigned task. In\r\nthe absence of definite factual data, evaluation of the life of\r\nforeign vessels will sometimes prove difficult. Here, again, an\r\nunderestimate is dangerous.\r\n\r\nMobility is capability of movement. It is compounded of the elements\r\nof speed, radius, and the ability to operate under imposed conditions\r\nof weather, visibility, hydrography, and other possible obstacles to\r\ncertain and free movement. Mobility is one of the most important\r\nfactors pertaining directly to relative position, to apportionment of\r\nfighting strength, and to freedom of action. Closely related factors\r\nare the organization, disposition, and methods of operation of the\r\nenemy, and of own forces. Accurate knowledge of these factors, before\r\nan operation, greatly enhances the possibilities of dealing\r\neffectively with the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the implements of war embraces such factors as the\r\nefficiency of motive machinery, the integrity of underwater\r\ncompartments and other material construction, and physical endurance.\r\nThe last applies not only to material, but also to living beings, and\r\ninvolves the ability to withstand the wasting effects of operations,\r\nwhether due to fatigue, hardship, disease, worry, wounds, or other\r\ncauses. Here again, it is obvious that the commander will often have\r\nonly an imperfect idea of the condition of the enemy in this respect.\r\nHis experience will lead him to form an accurate estimate of his own\r\ncondition. Definitely, unless he has positive information to the\r\ncontrary, he assumes that the condition of the enemy is no worse or\r\nbetter than his own. (See also the psychological factors, page 125 and\r\nthe personnel factor, page 127).\r\n\r\n(v) Logistics support is of primary concern to the commander. In the\r\nnaval service, this is particularly true of the strategical estimate.\r\nWhile the factor may also have some bearing on a tactical estimate,\r\nlogistics support will rarely change sufficiently, during a naval\r\nbattle, to affect the outcome. This support exercises a dominant\r\ninfluence upon the fighting power of armed forces. It is concerned\r\nwith the availability, adequacy, and supply of the following:\r\n\r\n    Material: items such as fuel, ammunition, weapons, aircraft,\r\n        food, clothing, spare parts, repair materials, animals,\r\n        and general supplies.\r\n\r\n    Personnel: military and civilian; number and quality of\r\n        replacements.\r\n\r\n    Facilities: factors such as bases; manufacture and repair\r\n        facilities, afloat and ashore; shelter; sanitation;\r\n        hospitalization; recreation; transportation; education;\r\n        counter-espionage; counter-propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe limitation imposed upon operations by logistics represents the\r\nfinal limit of a commander's plan of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) Survey of the Characteristics of the Theater of Operations.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the theater of operations exert an influence,\r\nalways important, sometimes paramount, upon the possibility of\r\nattaining the objective, and upon the strategical and tactical\r\noperations that may be employed.\r\n\r\nAt this point in his estimate the commander utilizes his charts,\r\nintelligence reports, and hydrographic publications to make a factual\r\nstudy of the theater. This study is not for the purpose, at this time,\r\nof drawing any conclusions as to possible courses of action, but to\r\nfurnish data which will assist in consideration of later sections of\r\nthe estimate. The study may be made under several important headings,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n(a) Hydrography. A study of the hydrography will determine the depth\r\nof water, the existence of shoals, the presence of unusual currents,\r\nthe rise and fall of the tides, the availability of channels, and\r\nother pertinent features. These are recorded for later use.\r\n\r\nShallow water may permit mining or may prevent the operation of\r\nsubmarines. On the other hand, the ability to mine in shallow water\r\nmay be curtailed by strong currents or by the rise and fall of the\r\ntide. Again, the depth of water, the strength of currents, and the\r\nrange of the tide may determine the feasibility of netting the\r\nentrance to a port or base. In a tactical action, advantage may be\r\ntaken of shoals to limit the freedom of action of the enemy, without,\r\nhowever, interfering with that of one's own forces.\r\n\r\n(b) Topography. The topography of the area is also frequently of\r\ninterest to the naval commander. In actions close to the shore, the\r\ncharacter of the coast may play an important role. A high bluff,\r\ncombined with considerations as to light, may create a very definite\r\nadvantage or disadvantage in a naval tactical situation.\r\n\r\nTopography may be a most important consideration in determining what\r\nbases are to be used. The commander makes note of the topography of\r\nthe various possible bases; later in his estimate, the natural\r\nfeatures lending assistance to the defense of the various sites may\r\nplay an important part in the selection of bases.\r\n\r\nThe use of channels may depend upon the topography of the bordering\r\nland. Questions arise as to whether such land can be seized and held,\r\nor, if in friendly hands, whether it can afford adequate protection to\r\nthe channel.\r\n\r\nIn any landing operation, the topography of the area to be occupied\r\nmay be the controlling factor.\r\n\r\n(c) Weather. The seasonal weather in the theater will have a direct\r\nbearing upon operations. The use of aircraft, the employment of light\r\nforces, the habitability of ships over long periods, the use of smoke,\r\nthe range at which a gun action may be fought, the effect of spray and\r\ngases,--these considerations are but some of the matters which will be\r\naffected by weather.\r\n\r\nThe possession of, and the position of, meteorological stations within\r\nthe theater are of growing importance in the successful planning of\r\ncoordinated air, submarine, and surface operations.\r\n\r\n(d) Daylight and Dark Periods. It may be well under this heading to\r\nput in tabular form the times of sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset,\r\nthe phases of the moon, and the duration of morning and evening\r\ntwilight. When, for example, the commander is considering night\r\ndestroyer attacks, the operation of submarines, or the type of\r\nprotective screens he desires to use, he may profitably refer to these\r\ntabulations.\r\n\r\n(e) Relative Location and Distance. No part of the study of the\r\ncharacteristics of the theater is of greater importance than that\r\npertaining to relative location and distance. At this point it may be\r\nfound advantageous to place in tabular form the distances between the\r\nimportant positions within the geographical area of the theater. This\r\nstudy furnishes knowledge as to the availability of certain localities\r\nfor use in support of, or in cooperation with, forces at other\r\nlocalities, and as to distances in relation to steaming capabilities\r\nof the various units which make up the commander's force.\r\n\r\n(f) Lines of Transportation and Supply. The usual sea routes which\r\npass through the theater are an important subject of study; also,\r\nparticular focal points, defiles, and restricted waters which are, or\r\nmay prove to be, critical areas with respect to own or enemy forces.\r\nOther items are the significant routes from home or enemy territory,\r\ni.e., the lines of communication, the terminal points, and the\r\nflanking positions along these lines.\r\n\r\n(g) Facilities and Fortifications. The facilities for the support,\r\nupkeep, and repair of the units of the commander's forces and of the\r\nopposing force, as well as the fortifications existing within the\r\narea, may require consideration. Other features which may render a\r\nport or base of value, or which may indicate a possible necessity of\r\ndenying it to the enemy, also merit attention.\r\n\r\n(h) Communications. In strategical estimates, more particularly in\r\nbroad ones covering large theaters, study of communications involves\r\nnot only those means under the commander's control, but also his\r\nrelation to the system of regional and national communications\r\noperated by his government. Examination is made into the established\r\nphysical stations; such examination includes radio, cables, and\r\nperhaps land wires.\r\n\r\nIn tactical estimates the means of communication which affect the\r\nengagement are more directly those under the control of the commander.\r\nAn examination into the organization of the means to meet conditions\r\nprevailing in the theater is appropriate here.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of communications is that of maintaining all forms\r\nagainst enemy interference. The importance of this feature in planning\r\nmay not safely be overlooked, and careful study is indicated to\r\nprovide for guaranteeing communications during action. The\r\ncharacteristics of the theater, as they relate to this feature, are\r\nconsidered here.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, consideration of interference with enemy\r\ncommunications is included, so far as significance attaches to them\r\nwith respect to the theater of operations.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the Estimate Form varies greatly with the type of\r\nproblem under consideration. However, in all estimates, this is the\r\nplace where the commander searches the theater for factors affecting\r\ncommunications for the particular problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the completion of this subsection of the estimate, the commander\r\nhas assembled and placed in workable form the information to which he\r\nexpects to refer in the succeeding parts of the estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) Conclusions as to Relative Fighting Strength.\r\n\r\nHaving surveyed the means available and opposed, as well as the\r\ncharacteristics of the theater of operations, the commander will find\r\nit useful to summarize the pertinent information available, in order\r\nthat the strength and weakness of own and enemy forces can be readily\r\nvisualized and compared. Thus the existing advantages and\r\ndisadvantages are made apparent, and conclusions are drawn as to\r\nrelative fighting strength.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory procedure is to place strength and weakness factors in\r\nparallel columns for own and enemy forces. From careful consideration\r\nof the facts so far determined in Section I-B, there are extracted and\r\nexpressed briefly the pertinent strength and weakness factors.\r\n\r\nIt is usually easier to determine all the strength and weakness\r\nfactors in detailed tactical estimates than in broad strategical\r\nestimates.\r\n\r\nThe former deal in relatively more factual terms, with definite\r\ncomparisons such as with respect to maximum speeds, numbers and\r\ncaliber of guns, numbers and types of aircraft, numbers and types of\r\ntorpedoes, and other such items which give the factual basis for\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nIn broad strategical estimates, this factual basis is present, e.g.,\r\nas to distances, radii of ships, geographical locations of forces, and\r\nthe like. But other factors may not be so definite, especially as\r\nregards enemy forces. For example, it will often be difficult for the\r\ncommander to say that the enemy's logistics problem is easier or more\r\ndifficult than his own, unless he has a good idea of the amount of\r\nfuel, ammunition, and stores available to the enemy within the time\r\nlimits involved. The evaluation of training, spirit, health, and\r\ncourage of personnel is, as previously noted, relatively easy to\r\ndetermine for own forces, but more or less of a conjecture in regard\r\nto the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe value of the entries in the parallel columns at this point of the\r\nestimate will depend upon the skill of the commander in judging the\r\nfactual data contained in all of the known factors of strength and\r\nweakness. The proper entries to be made will depend upon\r\ncircumstances. In one estimate, for example, the anti-aircraft\r\narmament available to a carrier group will be of vital importance. In\r\nanother estimate of the same carrier group, anti-aircraft defense will\r\nbe of no importance because no enemy aircraft can be employed in the\r\nsituation being estimated. Again, in a local tactical situation, if\r\nthe ships involved have just been fueled, the economical steaming\r\nradius may be of no immediate importance. And while the total amount\r\nof high-test gasoline which can be produced in a State in the coming\r\nyear may be vital to a broad strategical estimate involving war\r\nagainst trade, that information may be of little use in a tactical\r\nestimate of a localized, fleeting situation.\r\n\r\nThus, in determining what factors to evaluate, and in assessing their\r\nrelative value, the commander considers only such as can possibly\r\naffect the effort to be made in the theater under consideration. The\r\nsummary of strength and weakness factors is, then, a summary of those\r\nfactors which the commander considers will affect the character of his\r\neffort. This summary indicates the relative importance of such\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nA mere list of facts will not serve the purpose. What is needed here\r\nis a series of evaluations and conclusions which may result from a\r\nstudy of the pertinent details.\r\n\r\nWith the circumstances attending his particular problem clearly in\r\nmind, the commander carefully reviews each of the factors of fighting\r\nstrength in the theater; he classes each as either a strength or\r\nweakness factor for himself or his opponent, and enters it in the\r\nproper column. A strength factor for one is not necessarily entered as\r\na weakness factor for the opponent:--what is required is a\r\nwell-digested summary of the factors which give to either side an\r\nadvantage or a disadvantage as compared to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nThe Estimate procedure has, to this point, established the basis for\r\nthe solution of the problem through evaluation of the factors\r\npertaining to the requirements of suitability, of feasibility, and of\r\nacceptability of the consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\nOn this basis, the commander is ready to consider such courses of\r\naction as may be pertinent. To this end, he has a choice of\r\nprocedures. He may first consider courses of action for himself. He\r\nmay prefer, however, to consider first those which are applicable to\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nIf the commander considers his own courses of action first, this\r\nprocedure has an advantage in that it narrows, later, the scope of\r\nenemy courses which are pertinent to his situation. This is true\r\nbecause consideration of enemy courses may in such a case be\r\nrestricted to those which give promise of countering, effectively, his\r\nown courses of action.\r\n\r\nThis procedure may also have a certain psychological advantage, in\r\nthat the commander may thereby avoid becoming unduly impressed by the\r\npotentialities of enemy action. Occasionally, prior consideration of\r\nenemy courses may tend to put the commander, unnecessarily, on the\r\nmental defensive.\r\n\r\nFirst consideration of his own courses of action is especially\r\nappropriate for a commander whose mission requires him to assume the\r\ninitiative, particularly when the relative fighting strength indicates\r\nthat he can compel enemy action to conform to his. This is frequently\r\nthe case when enemy action will chiefly affect details rather than the\r\ngeneral trend of the operations.\r\n\r\nThese reflections indicate that first consideration of his own courses\r\nof action will very frequently be advantageous to the commander. Such\r\na sequence is therefore indicated preferentially in the Estimate Form,\r\nand next discussed. However occasions may arise when consideration in\r\nthe reverse order is preferable. Sometimes the prior consideration of\r\nenemy potentialities has the advantage of making the commander's\r\nestimate more complete with respect to the obstacles which he is to\r\novercome. Furthermore, when the effectiveness of his future action is\r\nseen to depend chiefly upon what the enemy can do, or when the\r\ninitiative lies manifestly with the enemy, and when the commander's\r\nmission requires him to frustrate enemy action, rather than to assume\r\nthe initiative himself, the prior consideration of enemy courses of\r\naction may be indicated.\r\n\r\nThe commander may therefore consider the subject matter of Sections II\r\nand III in the order hereinafter followed, or he may reverse that\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF SUITABLE, FEASIBLE, AND ACCEPTABLE COURSES OF ACTION\r\n\r\nA. Analysis of the Assigned Objective.\r\n\r\nIn order further to clarify the problem, consideration of the\r\ncommander's courses of action may profitably commence with an analysis\r\n(page 53) of the assigned objective. Section I-A contained an\r\nappreciation of this objective on the basis of the salient features of\r\nthe situation. A close examination is now possible in the light of the\r\nadditional information furnished by the full details (Section I-B) as\r\nto the means available and opposed, and as to the characteristics of\r\nthe theater (page 121).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the mission (page 121), is now again stated, and is\r\nrestudied. The task is thoughtfully examined anew, in view of the\r\nforces and positions now known. The purpose is scrutinized with equal\r\ncare, because it indicates the further end in view for the common\r\neffort. Now, obstacles to success which, in Section I-A, could not\r\nfully be appreciated can be examined against the background afforded\r\nby visualization of the enemy's ability to oppose the attainment of\r\nthe assigned objective.\r\n\r\nThis analysis calls for such discussion by the commander as is\r\nessential to better understanding of his assigned objective. Some\r\nrestatement and repetition may be desirable as to the subjects already\r\ndiscussed under the appreciation of the assigned objective. In solving\r\ncertain types of problems, where simple estimates, only, are required,\r\nthere may be no necessity for further treatment. Even in these cases,\r\nhowever, the commander restates his mission in this subsection, in\r\norder to ensure a clear comprehension of its task and purpose, as a\r\nsound basis for his further solution of the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Survey of Courses of Action.\r\n\r\nThe Fundamental Military Principle (page 41) represents an equation\r\n(page 23) based on five factors: the appropriate effect desired, the\r\nmeans available, the means opposed, the characteristics of the\r\ntheater, and the consequences as to costs. Of these five factors, all\r\nbut the last (the consequences as to costs) have by this time, in the\r\ncourse of the estimate, been assigned values as definite as the\r\ncommander's information and his study permit.\r\n\r\nFrom this point on, the problem is to evolve tentative solutions\r\n(courses of action) and to test them (page 98), severally, by\r\nreference to the factors. The tests as to suitability and feasibility\r\ncan now be made with reference to the known factors. The test as to\r\nacceptability of the consequences involves an unknown factor. However,\r\nfor each tentative solution of the problem, a value can be assigned\r\nfor this factor, because all five factors are interdependent (pages 32\r\nand following), so that the value of any of them can be set by a study\r\nof the others. It is through this procedure that evaluation of the\r\nconsequences factor is accomplished (an application of the corollary\r\nPrinciple of the Acceptable Consequences as to Costs, page 35).\r\n\r\nBy means of the standard tests, the several tentative solutions are\r\nalso compared to each other in the light of envisaged enemy action, so\r\nas to enable the commander to select the best solution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe commander now, as a result of his reflective thinking as to\r\ncourses of action, makes a list of those which he has visualized for\r\nhimself. There may be one course of action, or many; ordinarily there\r\nare several.\r\n\r\nExamples of courses of action have been given in the basic discussion\r\nof the subject (pages 89 and 92). In listing his courses, the\r\ncommander can add to clarity of thought and of expression by\r\nvisualizing the objective embodied in each course and by envisaging\r\nalso, the action, expressed in proper detail, for its attainment. This\r\nprocess is naturally the more important when the objective is inferred\r\nrather than specifically expressed, and when the action involved calls\r\nfor more description than can be obtained merely by stating the\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\nFor example, the commander may include a course of action such as \"to\r\nraid enemy trade in the area EFGH\". The objective is here inferred; it\r\nis not clearly stated. The commander may therefore be well advised to\r\nadd a notation of what the objective is; indeed, more than one\r\nobjective may be involved. Objectives thus inferred might include,\r\nwhen specifically stated, the infliction of damage on enemy trade, the\r\ninfliction of damage on enemy combatant forces protecting such trade,\r\nthe disruption of enemy supply arrangements, or such others as may be\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nThis clear visualization is essential to the establishment of the\r\nrelationship between the assigned objective and the objective inherent\r\nin the course of action (page 89). If, for instance, the motivating\r\ntask is to \"divert enemy forces to the area EFGH\", the commander may\r\nconsider the course of action \"to raid enemy trade in area EFGH\". By\r\ninfliction of damage to, and by disruption of, enemy supply\r\n(objectives of his raiding), he expects to accomplish the diversion of\r\nenemy forces to the area EFGH, because the enemy will wish to protect\r\nhis trade against such raids. The relationship between the assigned\r\nobjective and the objective inferred in the course of action is thus\r\nmade clear.\r\n\r\nWith regard to expression of the action to be taken, the commander may\r\nproperly desire to be more explicit than by merely saying, for\r\nexample, \"to destroy the enemy\". Here the objective is clear (it is\r\n\"the destruction of the enemy\"), but the expression of the action is\r\nso general that additional description may be needed. Examples of more\r\nexplicit statement have been given previously (page 89).\r\n\r\nOn occasion the higher commander may predetermine the commander's\r\ncourse of action for the attainment of the objective assigned to the\r\nlatter. Circumstances under which such procedure may be properly\r\napplicable, and the effect which it has on the commander's estimate,\r\nhave been previously discussed (page 86).\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Application of Tests for Suitability, Feasibility, and\r\nAcceptability.\r\n\r\nThe courses of action which the commander has envisaged are now\r\nsubjected to test (page 98). This essential stage in thought is\r\nintended to put the courses of action to proof as tentative solutions\r\nof the problems. The principle here recognized is that suggestion has\r\nno logical nor rightful claim upon action or belief until it has\r\nreceived adequate confirmation. Such confirmation is, in part,\r\nprovided by these tests.\r\n\r\nThe tests applied are for suitability, for feasibility, and for\r\nacceptability as to consequences. Each of these tests is a separate\r\none. Each course of action is formally subjected to test. When the\r\ntests are completed, the courses of action stand classified in these\r\nrespects. During these tests, some courses of action may be rejected;\r\nsuch are then omitted in the final classification.\r\n\r\nThese formal tests are not to be confused with the preliminary tests\r\nalready given by the commander to each course of action as it occurs\r\nto mind. Necessarily, there is such a preliminary test, because the\r\ncommander does not wish to entertain inappropriate courses of action.\r\nFor a competent commander, the mental power to envisage solutions of a\r\nmilitary problem is so much grounded in experience that appropriate\r\nsuggestions are most likely to occur; in fact, discriminating thought\r\nwith respect to military problems is natural for such a commander.\r\nThis immediate discrimination is, however, merely the preliminary\r\ntest. It prevents setting up wooden soldiers only to knock them down,\r\nbut it does not necessarily subject each suggested solution to a\r\nthorough analysis.\r\n\r\nThe commander may apply the tests to each course of action as it\r\noccurs to his mind. This procedure, however, may be rendered\r\nimpossible by the fertility of suggestion; perhaps the commander has\r\nthought of several courses of action practically simultaneously. It\r\nis, therefore, often better to apply the tests to all of the courses\r\nof action, in turn, during a separate stage of the process of\r\nthinking. This is the procedure indicated herein, as standard, by the\r\nsequence of steps in this section of the Estimate. The process of\r\ntesting, itself, may bring to mind those combinations of courses of\r\naction previously referred to (page 93).\r\n\r\nThe degree of formality characteristic of the tests varies with the\r\nnature of the problem. In a broad strategical estimate, these tests\r\nmay be searching and extensive; they may then consume much time. Yet,\r\nif the commander, in making a quick decision of great urgency in\r\nactual battle, does not apply the tests, he may adopt a course of\r\naction leading to tragic results. In such circumstances, the competent\r\ncommander, under pressure of danger, grasps the whole complex\r\nsituation without loss of time. He is not carried away by any chance\r\nimpressions. He does not overlook what is significant in the\r\nunexpected event. Because he is mentally prepared for the exercise of\r\ncommand (page 114) he sees things in their true proportions (page 4).\r\nIn immediate response, he coolly chooses the same course of action\r\nwhich he would adopt if he had time for careful deliberation.\r\n\r\nIn making the tests, the commander rejects courses of action found\r\nunsuitable in that they will not, if successfully prosecuted,\r\ncontribute to the attainment of the objective. He does not, as yet,\r\nreject courses of action found to be promising of only partial\r\naccomplishment of the task, because there may be later possibilities\r\nof effecting combinations to this end.\r\n\r\nThe commander also rejects, at this point, courses of action found to\r\nbe infeasible of accomplishment. He is careful, however, not to\r\nreject, abruptly, any which may later be found to be feasible in\r\ncombination with other courses.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the commander now rejects courses of action found to\r\ninvolve excessive consequences as to costs. Here, again, however, he\r\nbears in mind the possibilities of later combinations.\r\n\r\nThe commander does not, as yet, make a selection of one course of\r\naction in preference to another. He merely desires to restrict further\r\nthought, toward his Decision, to those which are found, on the basis\r\nof the estimate so far, to be suitable, feasible, and acceptable. He\r\nmay, however, make a selection to the extent of effecting proper\r\ncombinations whose applicability has already been demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe commander also takes stock, at this stage of the estimate, of the\r\nrelative degree of suitability, feasibility, and acceptability of\r\nretained courses, so far as can be substantiated.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. Listing Retained Courses of Action.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing process indicates to the commander the courses of action\r\nwhich may properly be retained as suitable, as feasible, and as\r\nacceptable. He therefore draws up a list of retained courses and\r\nclassifies them according to the degree of their suitability, of their\r\nfeasibility, and of their acceptability with respect to consequences.\r\n\r\nThis list does not necessarily represent the final combinations of\r\ncourses of action; the incomplete solutions may yet become part of the\r\ncourse of action finally selected. Also it is not impossible that\r\ncombinations already made will subsequently be recombined as a result\r\nof further analysis.\r\n\r\nIt may be apparent to the commander at this time that he does not\r\nhave, as yet, any course of action which fulfills the test of\r\nsuitability as to scope, either originally or by combination. A later\r\nconclusion is made (Section V) as to final combinations to achieve\r\nfull scope. This conclusion, however, may point the way, as later\r\nobserved, to a Decision adopting an objective short of that which\r\nwould, if achieved, lead to the accomplishment of the motivating task.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION INTO THE CAPABILITIES OF THE ENEMY\r\n\r\nWhile the commander realizes that the Fundamental Military Principle\r\n(page 41) governs the enemy's problem no less than his own, he has to\r\naccept more of hypothesis and conjecture (the so-called \"fog of war\")\r\nin applying the principle to the enemy's situation. The method of\r\nreflective thinking utilized (Section II) for the commander's own\r\nproblem calls for certain further safeguards in application to the\r\nenemy capabilities, since they are of course usually not so well known\r\nto the commander as are his own.\r\n\r\nCapabilities, in the meaning applicable herein, indicate actions which\r\nthe force concerned, unless forestalled or prevented from taking such\r\nactions, has the capacity to carry out. Such potentialities of the\r\nenemy are of course among the vital factors to be considered in\r\nestimating the situation. In his estimate, however, the commander's\r\ninterest is not confined to what the enemy will probably do;\r\nprobabilities are subject to change, and do not, therefore, cover the\r\nwhole field of capabilities. The commander is not exclusively\r\ninterested in what the enemy may intend to do, or even in what the\r\nenemy may be known, at the time, to intend to do; such intentions are\r\nalso subject to change. The commander is interested in everything that\r\nthe enemy can do which may materially influence the commander's own\r\ncourses of action.\r\n\r\nIn reaching a conclusion as to enemy capabilities, the commander makes\r\nan estimate from the enemy's viewpoint and considers that the enemy\r\ncommander, faced with the counterpart of his own situation, is\r\nendeavoring to attain objectives in furtherance of his own mission.\r\nEach commander is endeavoring to create for himself a favorable\r\nmilitary situation, and to prevent his opponent from succeeding in the\r\nsame intent. The physical objectives for each may be the other's armed\r\nforces; certain positions, sea areas, harbors, or territory may also\r\nbe likely physical objectives.\r\n\r\nIn such a parallel building up of plans, it is possible that the\r\nopposing forces may not come, at least for a time, into actual\r\nconflict. More especially in the initial stages, the respective plans\r\nmay lead to operations in different parts of the theater. Again, the\r\ngeographical direction of search may cause the forces to miss contact.\r\nMoreover, unless one commander definitely makes provision to seek out\r\nand engage, the two forces, each on the defensive, may find themselves\r\n\"shaking fists\" at each other across an ocean area.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this possibility, however, a conclusion, on an\r\ninsufficient basis, that the enemy will or will not seek him out and\r\nengage him, or that the enemy will or will not do anything else, may\r\nbe fraught with the most serious consequences for the commander.\r\nAccordingly, in estimating the enemy's situation, he puts himself in\r\nthe enemy's position, while subordinating his own hopes and desires.\r\nHe credits the enemy with the possession of good judgment and of the\r\nresolution and ability to apply with skill the fundamentals of\r\neffective warfare, subject, naturally, to the justified conclusions\r\nwhich the commander has drawn (Section I-B) on the basis of the\r\navailable factual data as to relative fighting strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Survey of the Enemy's Problem.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the commander's estimate pertains, of course, to the\r\nexisting situation as viewed by the enemy. This fact, alone, may\r\ninject into the problem certain factors which differ from those\r\napplicable with respect to the commander's view of his own problem, as\r\ndetermined to this point.\r\n\r\n(1) Summary of the Enemy's Situation.\r\n\r\nFrequently it may happen that the enemy does not have certain\r\nsignificant information. The fact of such lack of information may have\r\nbeen established by the conclusions drawn as to relative fighting\r\nstrength (Section I-B). If this be the case, notation of the fact is\r\nmade at this point in the commander's estimate of the enemy's\r\nsituation. If doubt exists as to the extent and accuracy of the\r\nenemy's information, it will be desirable to credit the enemy with any\r\nknowledge which it would be dangerous for the commander to conclude\r\nwas not available to his opponent.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the enemy's situation, the commander may brief the\r\nprocedure by indicating those significant features of his own\r\nsituation, as summarized in Section I-A and as particularized in\r\nSection I-B, which he does not consider are known to the enemy. The\r\ncommander will also indicate here any items of important information\r\nas to which he has only a suggestion or an inkling, but which he\r\nconsiders may be known in greater detail to the enemy.\r\n\r\n(2) Analysis of the Effect Desired by the Enemy.\r\n\r\nIt may appear on first thought that the best basis for determining the\r\npertinent enemy courses of action is to make a deduction of the\r\nenemy's mission. Sometimes, undoubtedly, this is the case. However, it\r\nis not always possible to deduce the enemy's mission correctly. If the\r\ndeduction is incorrect the remainder of the estimate will be on an\r\nunsound basis. If, as may happen, the enemy's plan has been captured,\r\nor if, by some other method, conclusive information has been\r\nobtained, it may be possible to state the enemy's mission. Even then,\r\nhowever, the enemy's mission may sometimes be changed. It is thus\r\nevident that the commander, by restricting his thought, may frequently\r\nfail to consider all of the enemy capabilities which may materially\r\ninfluence his own course of action.\r\n\r\nWith this precaution in mind, the commander, at this point in his\r\nEstimate, proceeds to analyze the effect desired by the enemy. The\r\ncommander intends to use his deductions, if such use appears to be\r\nsound, to narrow the field of consideration as to enemy courses of\r\naction. However, he reminds himself that such restriction will be\r\ndangerous unless it is established on sound grounds.\r\n\r\nThe first mental act toward determining the effect desired by the\r\nenemy is to form a reasoned opinion as to the situation which the\r\nenemy wishes to maintain or to create. The maintenance or creation of\r\nthis situation, existent or to be brought about, is an enemy\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\nFrom earlier association with the enemy, from intelligence of his\r\npeacetime preparations, and from a knowledge of his political and\r\nmilitary history, his broad current policies are generally matters of\r\ncommon report. The motives impelling the enemy to action may thus be\r\nevident. Past or present tendencies of the enemy, along certain\r\nspecific lines of endeavor, may be known. These may be corroborated by\r\nthe enemy action which has recently occurred.\r\n\r\nIn military undertakings of major scope the objectives of the enemy\r\nare often difficult of concealment. A survey of the objectives which\r\nthe enemy has been pursuing may allow a reasoned opinion to be formed\r\nas to the enemy's immediate objectives,--whether, at least, his future\r\naction will be offensive or defensive. The importance to be attached\r\nby the enemy to certain physical objectives may be indicated by the\r\nbroad aims known to exist. Present composition and disposition of the\r\nenemy's forces may betray the effort which he intends. Circumstances,\r\nclearly disadvantageous to the commander's forces, may disclose what\r\nhis enemy's aim may be for maintaining or creating a favorable (enemy)\r\nmilitary situation.\r\n\r\nHowever scant or incomplete the data from such sources or from others,\r\nthe commander seeks to gain, by piecing together, a composite basis of\r\nworkable value in arriving at a sound conclusion as to the enemy's\r\nfuture action.\r\n\r\nThe enemy objective thus visualized may serve as the purpose of the\r\nenemy's mission. The situation thus envisaged may be specific or broad\r\nin nature, depending on the soundness of the deductions. This, in\r\nturn, will depend on the extent and character of the information\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nIt may now be possible to deduce a definite task, which when\r\naccomplished, will attain the indicated purpose. However, as\r\npreviously stated, it is not desirable to be unduly specific. The\r\ncommander reflects on the several possibilities which if carried out\r\nwill attain the purpose. By being inclusive instead of restrictive in\r\nthis matter, he avoids the danger of overlooking enemy capabilities.\r\nMoreover, the information available will not always justify the\r\nderivation of a specific task.\r\n\r\nBy this process of reasoning, the commander may arrive at a studied\r\nopinion as to the enemy's appropriate effect desired. The commander's\r\nsafeguard is that he has not been too restrictive or specific. He\r\nexpects to encompass within his conclusion the limits of the enemy's\r\nobjectives and actions, so that his own planned action will not fail\r\nto cover all enemy action which can materially influence the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nSituations may be encountered when, in the equation referred to in\r\nSection II-B (page 135), no value can be assigned the factor of the\r\nappropriate effect desired which will constitute a sufficient basis\r\nfor deducing enemy courses of action. Such situations are not unusual,\r\nespecially in problems of lesser scope. In such cases, the commander\r\nis compelled to consider all possible enemy courses of action which\r\ncan materially influence his own plan. Therefore, in instances of this\r\nnature, it is apparent that the procedure of giving first\r\nconsideration to the commander's own courses of action affords the\r\nadvantage of (see page 134) narrowing the field as to the enemy\r\ncapabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Survey of Enemy Capabilities.\r\n\r\nIf, then (to repeat, because of the importance of the matter), the\r\ncommander believes that he has, in the deduced enemy effect desired, a\r\nsufficient basis for evolving all pertinent enemy capabilities, he now\r\nproceeds, by the mental process described in Section II, to list the\r\nenemy courses of action which he thinks merit attention. If there be\r\nno adequate basis, the commander will find it desirable to list all\r\nenemy courses of action which can materially affect his own effort.\r\n\r\nThe survey of fighting strength (Section I-B) has established, through\r\nconsideration of the \"means available and opposed\", and of the\r\n\"characteristics of the theater\", the limitations of enemy\r\ncapabilities from the standpoint of feasibility. Because, however, so\r\nmuch of the enemy's situation is usually conjectural, it is important\r\nto give the most searching attention to the comparison summary in\r\nSection I-B,--in fact, to consider fully every element of weakness and\r\nstrength, and of advantage and disadvantage. Such a study will\r\ndisclose every possibility which the enemy might exploit. The\r\ncommander may thus determine, for example, the enemy strength which\r\ncan be moved into positions within time limits that can affect the\r\ncommander's courses of action; he can also examine into possibilities\r\nof obtaining information concerning the enemy's moves.\r\n\r\nSuch a study enables the commander to envisage the enemy operations\r\nwhich presumably can materially affect his own plans. He may now list\r\nthe presumed capabilities of the enemy, in the form of courses of\r\naction, for purposes of further analysis. Naturally, he lists courses\r\nwhich appear to be suitable, feasible, and acceptable as to\r\nconsequences, but formal tests are deferred until the next phase of\r\nthe estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Application of Tests for Suitability, Feasibility, and\r\nAcceptability.\r\n\r\nHaving listed pertinent enemy courses of action as described above,\r\nthe commander next tests them for suitability, for feasibility, and\r\nfor acceptability as to their consequences.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is the same as for his own courses of action (Section\r\nII). However, since the enemy's appropriate effect desired, if\r\ndeducible at all, is often only an approximation, the test for\r\nsuitability is usually less rigid or absolute than for the commander's\r\nown courses of action. By the same token, since the enemy's fighting\r\nstrength will usually include elements of conjecture and hypothesis,\r\nthe test for feasibility may be less reliable than when applied to the\r\ncommander's own courses. In fact, if there are any reasonable doubts\r\nas to feasibility of an enemy course of action, it is properly\r\nretained for further consideration. The same considerations and the\r\nsame safeguard apply with respect to acceptability of the\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. Listing Retained Enemy Courses of Action.\r\n\r\nAll enemy courses of action which, after test, are retained for\r\nfurther study are now listed by the commander.\r\n\r\nWhile it is manifestly of advantage to the commander if the number of\r\nenemy courses can reasonably be reduced to only a few or even to one,\r\nit is important that no material enemy capability be neglected because\r\nof undue restriction of the field.\r\n\r\nThe previous analysis will have indicated, at least, in some cases,\r\nthe degree of suitability and feasibility, and will have enabled the\r\ncommander to form a considered opinion as to any preference, from the\r\nenemy viewpoint, on the basis of consequences as to costs.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, therefore, it will be possible to arrange retained\r\nenemy courses in order of priority, i.e., the more likely being listed\r\nbefore the less likely. In case of doubt, the higher priority is\r\nawarded by the commander to enemy courses which are more dangerous\r\nfrom his (the commander's) point of view.\r\n\r\nIn other instances, no priority can properly be indicated.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this study, the commander may now be able to combine\r\ncertain enemy courses. In any case, he closes this portion of the\r\nestimate with a list of them, classified so far as he finds\r\njustifiable, and thus made available for further effective use in the\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION\r\n\r\nThe extent to which detail is desirable in Section IV of the Estimate\r\nwill vary with the nature of the problem (page 95). Experience usually\r\ndemonstrates, however, that an estimate in only the necessary detail\r\nescapes the danger inherent in undue detail which would tend to befog\r\nthe main issues. As the commander proceeds with his estimate, he will\r\nrecognize the need for additional examination into details, and will\r\nconduct such examination accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Analysis and Comparison of Retained Courses of Action.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the estimate is the natural one of comparing the\r\ncommander's retained courses of action with those of the enemy which\r\nhave been retained for further study. This process consists of\r\nexecuting, in imagination, the plan contained in each of the\r\ncommander's courses of action, against that in each of the enemy's.\r\nOne method is for the Commander to take the initiative with each of\r\nhis plans and mentally to push it through with vigor. By this\r\nprocedure, he concentrates his thought on the effect to be produced,\r\non the changed situation which that effect will bring about for the\r\nenemy, on the modification in the enemy's effort which will be\r\ncaused, on the resulting obstacles which these modifications will\r\ncreate, and on the provisions which will have to be made to overcome\r\nthe obstacles.\r\n\r\nIt will at once be apparent that the commander may have to re-estimate\r\nthe enemy situation during this analysis. Such necessity arises\r\nbecause of the changes made by his own course of action upon the enemy\r\nsituation. The commander will desire to reach a studied conclusion as\r\nto what counter action the enemy may take when the nature of the\r\nplanned action against him becomes evident. This re-estimate of the\r\nsituation may be brief, as it is an adjustment of factors which are\r\nfamiliar through previous examination. Sometimes the re-estimate will\r\nhave been made mentally, before reaching this point, and adjustments\r\nmay already have been made in the written estimate, in anticipation of\r\nthis contingency. Sometimes the commander may find it desirable, after\r\nreaching this point, to re-write, at least in part, his original enemy\r\nestimate (Section III). The particular procedure adopted is\r\nunimportant; the important feature is to recognize that such a\r\nre-estimate process is normal, and especially so with reference to\r\nthis portion of the Estimate.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing discussion illustrates the point that an examination\r\ninto enemy capabilities is not complete if the commander puts himself\r\nin the enemy's place merely for the purpose of estimating the original\r\nsituation from the enemy viewpoint. In addition, the commander\r\nexamines each of the enemy's modified problems which the changed\r\nsituation, created by the execution of the commander's plan, has\r\nsuperimposed upon the enemy's original problem. Thus only can the\r\ncommander analyze the various ways whereby the enemy may oppose his\r\nown proposed courses of action. Thus only may sound conclusion later\r\nbe reached, in the next subsection of the estimate, as to what course\r\nof action, or combination of courses, is the best.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of plan against plan thus far has been restricted to\r\nthe method whereby the commander takes the initiative with each of his\r\nown retained courses of action. Another method is to imagine the enemy\r\nas taking the initiative, carrying through each of his courses against\r\neach of the commander's courses. This method is applicable, for\r\ninstance, to cases where the enemy is able to initiate action which,\r\nby its nature, would frustrate the execution of any of the commander's\r\ncourses. The choice of methods is a matter of judgment on the part of\r\nthe commander.\r\n\r\nIt is rarely that courses of action can be compared without resolving\r\neach, to some extent, into the detailed operations which it comprises.\r\nHowever, this analysis is confined, as previously explained (see page\r\n145), to the details whose consideration is necessary for purposes of\r\na sound comparison. In some cases there may be need for study in the\r\ngreatest detail. Generally, however, the requirement can be met by\r\nconsidering for each operation the kind of action, the types of\r\nweapons, and the physical objectives.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of these analyses of the impact of operations upon\r\neach other, there may occur to mind further operations which an alert\r\nand awakened enemy may undertake in opposition; the counter to these\r\noperations may also suggest itself.\r\n\r\nThe use of the chart, with positions and forces plotted, is here\r\nfrequently essential; in tactical problems diagrams and tables showing\r\npossibilities of position, distance, speed, maneuver, gun ranges,\r\nrelative strength in types and weapons are useful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough the procedure described above, the commander is afforded\r\nfurther opportunity to test his courses of action, as to suitability,\r\nfeasibility, and acceptability. He can, once more, view each of his\r\ncourses from the standpoint of its suitability. The visualized enemy\r\naction may introduce considerations, not previously realized, as to\r\nwhether certain of his own courses are suitable to the appropriate\r\neffect desired, when results are envisaged on the basis of the\r\npossible opposition. As to feasibility, the analysis permits him to\r\nmake a further estimate of the enemy capabilities with respect to\r\nobstructing or preventing the desired outcome of his (the commander's)\r\ncourses of action. In addition, by visualizing the pertinent\r\noperations involved, he enables himself to evaluate the costs to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nShould the commander conclude, at this stage, that further\r\nconsideration of any of his courses, so far retained, is not\r\njustified, he will naturally reject such courses so as to confine\r\nfurther analysis within narrower limits.\r\n\r\nShould he find, during his analysis, that further combinations should\r\nbe made among his retained courses, he makes such combinations and\r\nuses them in his comparison.\r\n\r\nHowever, he defers, until the next subsection, his choice of the\r\ncourse to be finally selected, or his conclusion that none can\r\njustifiably be adopted. The process of comparison is confined to\r\ndeduction, rearrangement, and justified rejection, preliminary to\r\nweighing and selecting in the next subsection.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Determination of the Best Course of Action.\r\n\r\nThe commander is now ready to ponder over his retained courses of\r\naction as further analyzed in the light of enemy opposition. All of\r\nthese courses, if carried out, are presumably competent, in varying\r\nextent, to attain the appropriate effect desired. He will now examine\r\nand consider them with the specific intent of coming to a conclusion\r\nas to which one, or which combination, he will select as the best. The\r\nanalysis of each course of action in comparison with each enemy course\r\nhas made possible a comparison, to this end, of the commander's\r\nretained courses with each other.\r\n\r\nAt this point, therefore, the commander again assembles his retained\r\ncourses of action.\r\n\r\nHe includes the combinations which the preceding analysis has\r\nindicated belong properly together. He then considers the final\r\ntabulation in the light of the considerations now to be noted.\r\n\r\nThe conclusive tests are now made for suitability, for feasibility,\r\nand for acceptability as to consequences. Because of the importance of\r\nthis terminal analysis, it is desirable that the tests be as precise\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThe commander now has, in addition to his list of the retained courses\r\nof action, a summarized comparison of each with the others, under the\r\nseveral pertinent headings. He next examines this all-inclusive\r\nsummary, with the intent of selecting the best course of action.\r\n\r\nIt may be found that one, or another, or a combination, is best.\r\nAgain, there is the possibility of considering, as best, a course of\r\naction which, if carried out, will only complete an initial stage\r\ntoward the accomplishment of the motivating task.\r\n\r\nIf the result of the analysis has demonstrated that there is no\r\nsatisfactory course of action, this fact is here stated, with a\r\nnotation as to the reasons for such opinion. In this case the\r\ncommander faces a dilemma.\r\n\r\nUsually a task imposed on the commander by higher authority will be a\r\ncarefully considered assignment of part of the superior's planned\r\neffort. The commander may expect normally to find that his own\r\nestimate of the situation will yield courses of action which, if\r\nsuccessfully carried out, will accomplish the task assigned. The\r\nreasoned plan of the superior is a safeguard in this respect.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, realism requires that the commander be fully prepared to\r\nmeet the possible dilemma:--When he cannot envisage a course of action\r\nfor accomplishing the assigned task, or when, of the several courses\r\nof action under consideration, he finds none satisfactory, what is he\r\nto do? (See page 70).\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the commander reviews his estimate in all\r\nits aspects. By minute re-examination he endeavors to find ways of\r\naccomplishing his assigned task. If he cannot accomplish the task, he\r\nseeks for ways whereby he can further such accomplishment so far as is\r\nreasonably feasible. If unable, in any degree, to further the\r\naccomplishment of his task, he endeavors to contribute, so far as he\r\nfeasibly and acceptably can, to the accomplishment of the purpose of\r\nhis mission.\r\n\r\nIt is to be expected, of course, that, if unable to accomplish his\r\nassigned task, the commander will make constructive representations\r\n(page 103) to higher authority. The latter may then assign additional\r\nforces or may otherwise alter the problem,--for example, by assigning\r\na new task. However, a situation such as described may occur when the\r\ncommander is alone in a distant theater or when for other reasons he\r\nfinds himself unable to communicate, in time, with higher authority.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation the commander is under the necessity of\r\ndetermining, for himself, a task which is suitable, feasible, and\r\nacceptable under the circumstances (page 52).\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, at some point in the foregoing procedure, the\r\ncommander has been forced to abandon the solution of his basic\r\nproblem, because he has found that there is no sound solution. He has\r\nnot completely abandoned the solution of his original problem, because\r\nhe has not yet exhausted all of its possibilities. However, the\r\nsolution of the original problem has unquestionably entered a new\r\nphase, or step.\r\n\r\nThe new step presents the commander with a new problem, a phase in the\r\nsolution of the original problem; the new problem is related to the\r\nabandoned basic problem, because it arises out of the same situation,\r\nwhich has not changed. The new problem is, however, differentiated\r\nfrom the basic problem because it is based on a different incentive.\r\nThe incentive for the solution of the new problem arises directly out\r\nof a decision made by the commander himself, i.e., his decision that\r\nno sound solution for the basic problem can be found. The new problem\r\nis one for the commander himself to solve, i.e., it cannot properly be\r\ndelegated to a subordinate for solution, because its solution is\r\nnecessary as a basis for the commander's detailed plan. For these\r\nreasons the new problem is, by definition (page 106), a subsidiary\r\nproblem, of the type distinctive of the second step.\r\n\r\nAt what point in the solution of the original problem does the\r\ncommander abandon the basic problem and proceed with the solution of\r\nthe new, subsidiary problem which has arisen as described? There are\r\nvarious possible answers, all with a basis of reason, to this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of theoretical precision, it might be said that\r\nthe basic problem is abandoned when the conclusion is reached that its\r\nmotivating task cannot be accomplished. It might also be said that the\r\nbasic problem is abandoned when the conclusion is reached that the\r\ncommander can in no way contribute toward the accomplishment of the\r\nmotivating task.\r\n\r\nPractical experience indicates, however, that the basic estimate can\r\nprofitably be utilized until the conclusion is reached that no\r\ncontribution can be made to the purpose of the mission. At this point\r\na new estimate, subsidiary to the basic estimate, necessarily begins.\r\nThis view is confirmed, theoretically, by the fact that, at this point\r\nin the procedure, a radical change occurs with respect to the\r\nappropriate effect desired. In such circumstances, the commander\r\nconcludes that he cannot contribute, in any degree, to the\r\naccomplishment of his immediate superior's general plan.\r\n\r\nThe incentive for the solution of the subsidiary problem will\r\ntherefore arise, on the basis thus adopted, when the commander has\r\nconcluded that he cannot contribute to the accomplishment of his basic\r\nmission, and that he is under the necessity of evolving a new mission\r\nfor himself. His basic Decision (see discussion, hereafter, of Section\r\nV of the Estimate Form) will reflect this conclusion and will thereby\r\nafford him a basis for the solution of his subsidiary problem.\r\n\r\nProblems of the foregoing nature, where the commander justifiably\r\ndeparts from his instructions, are not unusual during the first step.\r\nHowever, they are scarcely typical of that step so long as an\r\norganized chain of command is in effective operation. In the more\r\nusual case, the commander, at this point in his estimate, makes note\r\nof his selected course of action. Whether he selects a single course\r\nor a combination, the selection is thereafter known as the best course\r\nof action (singular).\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V\r\n\r\nTHE DECISION\r\n\r\nIn the final section of the Estimate the commander is concerned with a\r\ndecision as to the selection of an objective or objectives determined\r\nby himself, for the attainment of the appropriate effect desired. This\r\ndecision also indicates, in proper detail, the action to be taken for\r\nthe attainment of the commander's selected objective. The decision\r\nreached at this point becomes the commander's general plan of action\r\nor provides the basis therefor. It is accordingly so important that\r\nwhen it has been formally stated in a basic problem it is thenceforth\r\nknown as the Decision.\r\n\r\nThe Statement of the Decision. Frequently the statement of the\r\nDecision may be merely a restatement of the best course of action.\r\nSuch phraseology is often adequate, provided, naturally, that the\r\nselected course of action has been, itself, correctly expressed (page\r\n95). Sometimes, however, the commander may desire, at this point in\r\nhis estimate, to develop such expression more fully. He may at this\r\npoint develop his selected course into a general plan, or he may defer\r\nthis development to the second step.\r\n\r\nIn any event the commander now scrutinizes his selected course of\r\naction to ensure that its expression conveys exactly the meaning which\r\nhe has in mind.\r\n\r\nHe bears in mind, also, that his Decision will settle the pattern of\r\nhis future action. If the selected objective is inferred, rather than\r\nspecifically stated, the commander will then ensure that the\r\ninference, with all its vital implications, is plain.\r\n\r\nAs to the statement of the action required to achieve this objective,\r\nthe commander realizes that the pattern laid down by the Decision is\r\nmerely a shape or general outline. The details will be introduced\r\nlater. The Decision covers the general outline of the action\r\ncontemplated for the entire force.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, only a part of the commander's force is to act, while\r\nthe remainder is to remain inactive, the Decision will cover not only\r\nthe kind of activity but also the extent of the inactivity. However,\r\nfor convenience in stating the Decision, such inactivity may be\r\ninferred, rather than expressly stated, so long as the meaning is\r\nmade clear. Thus, if the force, except for a raiding task group, is to\r\nremain inactive for the time being, the Decision may properly be \"to\r\nraid enemy communications in the area ---- with a task group\r\nconsisting of ----\", so long as the commander is satisfied that the\r\nimplication is clear, under the circumstances, that the remainder of\r\nhis force is to remain inactive.\r\n\r\nThe commander may properly include brief summarizing remarks as to the\r\nmethods, broadly viewed, whereby he intends to take action. However,\r\nhe introduces such detail only to the extent that he feels\r\namplification is needed, either for his own benefit or for the\r\nassistance of others who may use his estimate.\r\n\r\nDeductions or inferences which the commander wishes to note may, at\r\nthis point, be included with the Decision as corollaries (see next\r\npage).\r\n\r\nWhere combinations of courses of action have been made in selecting\r\nthe best course, the meaning can sometimes be improved at this point\r\nby modification of the previous wording.\r\n\r\nWhen, as previously discussed (page 151), the commander has concluded\r\nthat he cannot feasibly or acceptably adopt any course of action which\r\nwill accomplish his task, contribute in any measure to its\r\naccomplishment, or even contribute in any degree to the accomplishment\r\nof the purpose of his mission, he records that fact in his Decision.\r\nHis study of the problem will by this time, however, have given him\r\nthe necessary data for a conclusion as to what his new mission should\r\nbe. He therefore closes his basic estimate with a Decision, coupled\r\nwith a purpose therefor, (see below), which will serve as a new\r\nmission, i.e., as an appropriate effect desired. This provides a basis\r\nfor his solution of a subsidiary problem whose incentive is derived\r\nfrom this Decision.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the commander has had time and opportunity to represent\r\nhis situation on this basis to higher authority, and has received a\r\nnew task therefrom, the new task, coupled with the purpose also\r\nindicated by higher authority, will provide the mission for the\r\nsolution of a new basic problem.\r\n\r\nThe Purpose of the Decision. The purpose of the Decision is identical\r\nwith the motivating task,--provided, of course, that the Decision, if\r\ncarried out, will accomplish that task in full. When stated, the\r\npurpose is usually connected with the Decision by the words \"in order\r\nto\".\r\n\r\nIf the commander has concluded that he will take action by stages, the\r\nDecision may cover only the first stage. In all cases where the\r\nDecision will only partially accomplish the motivating task,\r\nappropriate words to link the Decision to its purpose may be such as\r\n\"to assist in\" or \"preparatory to\".\r\n\r\nThe statement of this purpose, in connection with the Decision, is\r\nfrequently helpful and is sometimes necessary in making clear the\r\nexact relationship between the Decision and the motivating task. In\r\nthe next planning step, where the detailed operations are determined,\r\nthis purpose is an important guide because each detailed operation is\r\nexpected to contribute to the accomplishment, not only of the\r\nDecision, but also of the motivating task.\r\n\r\nCorollaries to the Decision. The Decision may involve certain\r\ndeductions or inferences, either delimiting or amplifying its nature.\r\nThe commander may find it desirable to make note of these matters in\r\nconnection with his Decision. He may later wish to use these notes\r\nwhen formulating his plan. Since these matters relate to deductions or\r\ninferences which naturally follow as results of the Decision they are\r\nproperly referred to as \"corollaries\" to the Decision.\r\n\r\nThe nature of such corollaries may best be shown by an example. It is\r\nsupposed, for instance, that the commander has made the Decision \"to\r\nguard the Eastern Caribbean barrier against enemy penetration\". During\r\nthe course of his estimate of the situation, he has come to the\r\nconclusion that his operations to carry out this Decision will extend\r\ninto the area limited by Port X on the north, and Port Y on the south.\r\nThis conclusion is a deduction, which immediately assumes importance\r\nwhen the Decision is made. The commander states this deduced\r\nconclusion here, in connection with the Decision, for future guidance\r\nin resolving the Decision into detailed operations, as well as for\r\nlater use in his directives to limit the action of his subordinates.\r\n\r\nNo particular form is specified for such corollaries. It is\r\nsatisfactory to list them as Corollary I, Corollary II, etc. They do\r\nnot constitute a part of the Decision.\r\n\r\nRelation of the Decision to the Detailed Plan and Directives. The\r\nDecision is the basis for the commander's plan of action for his\r\nentire force. This plan is promulgated in one or more directives. The\r\nDecision, as it appears in the Estimate, is not yet the concern of\r\nsubordinate commanders. It does not become their concern until it is\r\nused in directives. As incorporated in the commander's detailed plan\r\nand in his directives, the Decision, whether further developed or not,\r\nconstitutes the commander's general plan and is referred to in those\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThe Decision, as it appears in the Estimate, is not bound by any rigid\r\nspecifications as to form. Later (Chapter VII), when the commander\r\nprepares for the inauguration of planned action by the formulation and\r\nissue of directives, he assumes the obligation of conveying the\r\nsubstance of his Decision to his subordinates in clear language. At\r\nthat time he will again have to subject its expression to scrutiny,\r\nand may find that he has to make modifications solely for\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE RESOLUTION OF THE REQUIRED ACTION INTO DETAILED OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n(The Second Step--The Solution of Subsidiary Problems)\r\n\r\n    The problem of the second step may be stated in question form\r\n    as follows: \"What action should I take for the attainment of\r\n    my objective as selected in the first step?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: For convenience a tabular form, inserted in the appendix,\r\npage 224, gives page references to the principal subdivisions of this\r\nChapter.]\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at his basic Decision, the commander, if he wishes to\r\nput it into effect, will proceed to formulate a plan of action which\r\ncan be cast into the forms of directives for execution. In making such\r\na plan, he provides for operations in the detail proper for his\r\nsituation. He thereby expands the general plan, indicated in or\r\ndeveloped from his basic Decision, into a complete plan which can\r\nreadily be placed in the Order Form (Chapter VIII) as a directive or\r\ndirectives for the guidance of his subordinates.\r\n\r\nThe procedure involved in formulating such a detailed plan of action\r\nhas been described previously in general terms (Chapter V). The method\r\nof determining the salient features of the operations required has\r\nalso been discussed (in Section III of Chapter IV). Therefore, these\r\nmatters are not repeated at this point.\r\n\r\nThe problems distinctive of this procedure (the second step, as\r\ndescribed in Chapter V) are subsidiary problems, in the sense that the\r\nincentive for their solution arises by reason of a decision already\r\nmade by the commander, i.e., the basic Decision, and because they are\r\nproblems which the commander recognizes are to be solved by himself\r\nand not by his subordinates.\r\n\r\nAssumptions. The commander's plan has been derived from an estimate of\r\nthe situation based on the best information available to him. Complete\r\nand accurate information is frequently lacking; hence, many military\r\nplans consider contingencies which, to make a plan possible, have been\r\naccepted in the estimate as assumptions.\r\n\r\nThe word assumption, when used to denote a basis for a plan, signifies\r\n\"the taking of something for granted\". It does not mean a conjecture,\r\nguess, or probability. The proposed action, resulting from a decision\r\nmade under an assumption, is designed to be taken only upon the\r\ndisclosure of the truth of the assumption. The fact that the\r\nassumption upon which the plan is based may prove false indicates the\r\nadvisability of developing several plans based upon various sets of\r\nassumptions.\r\n\r\nIt would be erroneous to believe that all contingencies can be\r\nforeseen, and to be content with a particular set of plans, all of\r\nwhich may prove to be wrong. It is not to be expected that a plan\r\nbased upon assumptions will, in all respects, be suitable for use in\r\nan actual situation. For example, it will seldom occur that an\r\nelaborate Battle Plan, based upon assumptions as to the various types,\r\ndispositions, and strengths of forces present, the weather conditions,\r\nand the intent of the enemy, can be used without changes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a plan for the sortie of a fleet from a harbor\r\nunder assumptions that high visibility exists, that airplanes can\r\noperate, and that hostile submarines will be the only force in\r\nopposition, may frequently be found entirely applicable to the actual\r\nsituation, or so nearly so as to require only slight modification. It\r\nis possible so to standardize such plans that only minor variables\r\nneed be indicated when the plan is to be used.\r\n\r\nThe visualization of valid and useful assumptions frequently makes the\r\nmost serious demands on professional knowledge and judgment.\r\n\r\nAlternative Plans. The word \"alternative\" is generally applied to\r\ncontingent plans intended to accomplish a common task, but developed\r\nfrom varying sets of assumptions. \"A choice between several\" is the\r\nmeaning of the word as here used. When such choice becomes necessary\r\nin a situation not yet clarified, that plan will be selected which has\r\nbeen derived from the set of assumptions considered by the commander\r\nas most likely to be correct. The selected plan is usually called the\r\nplan or the \"accepted plan\", and the other plans, coming from other\r\nless likely but still possible sets of assumptions, are called\r\nAlternative Plan No. 1, Alternative Plan No. 2, etc.\r\n\r\nNaval tactical situations particularly lend themselves to the drawing\r\nup of alternative plans in advance. There are numerous general\r\ncategories of such tactical plans. Among these the Battle Plan is of\r\nparamount concern. Others include plans for sortie, entrance, defense\r\nwhile cruising, etc. In each category, alternative plans may be\r\ndeveloped, based on various sets of assumptions.\r\n\r\nAlternative plans evolved in advance of detailed information may be\r\nfound useful as a general basis for action. Circumstances may prove to\r\nbe different from those previously visualized. The correct procedure\r\nis to keep the plans up to date, testing them, by the latest\r\ninformation, in a Running Estimate (Chapter IX). The commander will\r\nthus have a foundation for sound decision in the circumstances which\r\nactually arise.\r\n\r\nStill another use of alternative plans merits consideration. Early\r\ncoordinated action during actual operations may be demanded although\r\nneither time nor the information available has permitted a detailed\r\nestimate. If the commander has drawn up, in advance, plans based on\r\nassumptions as to conditions that conceivably might exist, he will be\r\nbetter able to appreciate the situations which actually arise. He can\r\nthus direct the necessary action with more rapidity and understanding\r\nthan if completely unprepared because of lack of planning. If he\r\ninforms his subordinates of his proposed action under certain assumed\r\nconditions, he will facilitate cooperation, because better mutual\r\nunderstanding will exist. The advance alternative plans here discussed\r\nare not necessarily confined to problems confronting a commander\r\nduring actual war operations. They may profitably be drawn up in\r\npeace, and may be the basis of training exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication of the Essential Elements of a Favorable Military\r\nOperation\r\n\r\nIn the solution of the problems distinctive of the second step, the\r\ncommander starts with a consideration of the salient features of a\r\nfavorably progressing military operation. This procedure is\r\nappropriate because any series of these problems, considered as a\r\nwhole, pertains to the single problem of determining the most\r\neffective operation, or series of operations, for carrying his basic\r\nDecision into effect. If the action contemplated in the basic Decision\r\nis of such a nature as to call for successive included efforts in more\r\nthan one stage, the commander limits his consideration, should he find\r\nsuch restriction advisable on sound grounds, to the operation or\r\noperations included in the first stage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn this basis, the commander considers, first, the feature of correct\r\nphysical objectives. He has first to determine what his correct\r\nphysical objectives will be.\r\n\r\nThis determination may or may not present a perplexity. Frequently,\r\nthe procedure of the first step (Chapter VI) will have plainly\r\nindicated one or more, perhaps all, of the physical objectives\r\ninvolved. In some cases, also, the basic Decision will have plainly\r\npointed out the action to be taken, and with respect to what physical\r\nobjectives. In these instances, the commander may, with little further\r\nanalysis or none, set down the operations which he considers necessary\r\nor desirable with respect to these physical objectives.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, however, the action indicated in the Decision, though\r\nplainly indicating the commander's intent--that is, his calculated\r\nline of endeavor--may not have designated the numerous physical\r\nobjectives as to which his effort is to be exerted. For example, the\r\nDecision \"to interrupt enemy trade on the southern maritime routes\" is\r\nquite clear, but what are the numerous exertions of force required,\r\nand with relation to what physical objectives? Immediately there is a\r\nperplexity. Guided by the analysis made in his previous estimate of\r\nthe situation, the commander now determines what the physical\r\nobjectives are, action as to which will contribute to the\r\naccomplishment of the effort. The sum total of the actions taken\r\nagainst these physical objectives is properly equivalent to the\r\naccomplishment of the action indicated in his Decision. He may not be\r\nable at this time to determine all of the correct physical objectives,\r\nbut he can determine certain correct ones (for the method, see Section\r\nIII of Chapter IV).\r\n\r\nThe correct physical objectives having been determined, so far as can\r\nbe done at this time, the commander studies each thoroughly,\r\ndeveloping the possibilities of certain effective actions (operations)\r\nwith reference thereto. For instance, in the case of a commander who\r\nhas been ordered to \"interrupt enemy trade on the southern maritime\r\nroutes\", he might develop one operation \"to bomb enemy facilities at\r\nPort X\", and another \"to capture or destroy enemy shipping along trade\r\nroutes\" (with an indication of the routes involved).\r\n\r\nThe operations thus developed are now listed in a definite sequence,\r\nin order to provide a proper basis for the further procedure. The\r\ncommander may find it desirable to state them in their order of\r\nimportance. Sometimes, however, it may be found advantageous to list\r\nthe operations in chronological sequence, i.e., in the order of their\r\nexecution. This point is further discussed hereafter (pages 166 and\r\n192). The commander is at liberty, of course, to use either method\r\naccording to its helpfulness in enabling him to visualize the elements\r\nof his problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe commander now considers the second feature: advantageous relative\r\npositions. He may already occupy an advantageous geographical location\r\nor locations (see pages 64 (bottom) and 65 (top)), or he may desire to\r\nimprove his positions in certain respects. An advantageous position\r\nmight be between the enemy and his base, in order to deny it to him.\r\nAnother advantageous position might be to windward of the enemy, for\r\nthe purpose of making a destroyer attack under the protection of a\r\nsmoke screen.\r\n\r\nThe commander now reconsiders, from the viewpoint of \"advantageous\r\nrelative positions\", the operations deduced with respect to \"correct\r\nphysical objectives\". As a result of this reconsideration, he may find\r\nthat certain of these operations may be retained without change,\r\nwhereas others may require modification.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, that two of the operations listed are those\r\nnoted above, viz:\r\n\r\n    \"To bomb enemy facilities at Port X\", and\r\n\r\n    \"To capture or destroy enemy shipping along trade routes\r\n    between the ---- parallels of north latitude and the\r\n    ---- meridians of west longitude.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of relative position, it may appear that the first\r\noperation is not affected seriously, if at all. Therefore, this\r\noperation may be left unchanged. However, the second operation may be\r\ndefinitely affected by relative position, because the best method of\r\ninterrupting enemy trade may be to employ raiding forces in focal\r\nareas. Therefore this operation might be altered to the form, \"to\r\ncapture or destroy enemy trade by raiding focal areas\" (with a\r\ndesignation of the areas).\r\n\r\nThe commander's study is now likely to suggest operations which were\r\nnot apparent when the analysis was confined to the correct physical\r\nobjectives, alone. New physical objectives may appear to require\r\nattention. If so, all such new operations are added to the list\r\ncompiled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe commander may now study his list of operations, compiled to this\r\npoint, from the standpoint of the third feature, proper apportionment of\r\nfighting strength. However, if the commander considers such apportionment\r\nnow, his subsequent study of the fourth element--\"adequate freedom of\r\naction\"--may develop a need for further operations which will in turn\r\ncall for a re-analysis as to his apportionment of fighting strength.\r\nTherefore, for purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that the\r\ncommander now defers consideration of such apportionment, and that\r\nhe proceeds at this point to study measures for ensuring adequate\r\nfreedom of action.\r\n\r\nThis study requires consideration of such matters as training, morale,\r\nsurprise, secrecy, cooperation, intelligence, logistics, and\r\nprovisions (communications, location of the commander, and the like)\r\nfor effective exercise of command. (See page 76). The commander\r\nexercises his judgment as to the degree of detail in which such\r\nmatters should be treated, according to the nature of his problems.\r\n\r\nIf any such subject--for example, communications--involves the\r\ndevelopment of a subsidiary plan (page 168), the measures noted in\r\nconnection with the formulation of the basic plan may be stated along\r\nbroad lines, such as: \"To provide for effective communications.\" Any\r\nspecific matters of considerable importance may also be included,--for\r\nexample, as to secrecy with respect to the use of communications.\r\nOther details may then be deferred until the commander takes up the\r\nnecessary subsidiary plan. Otherwise, all pertinent operations in\r\nconnection with these measures are naturally noted at this point.\r\n\r\nCertain of these measures for freedom of action are now to be\r\ndiscussed in some detail because of their important bearing on basic\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nIn certain operations contemplated by the commander, there may be a\r\nrequirement for additional training, sometimes of a special nature.\r\nThis may be true, for instance, if an operation involves the landing\r\nof an expeditionary force. Conditions permitting, the commander will\r\nnaturally desire to make provision for training exercises. If time or\r\nother conditions do not permit necessary training, he may find it\r\ndesirable to modify his plans accordingly. The salient features of a\r\nsubsidiary training problem are discussed hereafter (page 176), and\r\nmay well be considered at this point in developing the basic plan.\r\n\r\nThe commander may already have noted, in considering operations\r\nsuggested by his previous study of the situation, a need for certain\r\naction as to security, secrecy, and intelligence. Any additional\r\noperations of this nature, not previously noted, may well be\r\nincorporated at this point.\r\n\r\nSecurity of his own plan, and secrecy therefor, are important\r\nconsiderations with reference to intelligence activities. The\r\nrequirements as to intelligence and counter-intelligence features are\r\nprimary considerations as to any plan. Such considerations involve the\r\ncollection of information and its conversion into intelligence. The\r\nhampering of enemy intelligence activities is a related consideration.\r\n\r\nThe collection of useful information, and its denial to the enemy,\r\ncall for a definite plan. When information has been collected, it is\r\nsubjected to the processes (page 122) of analysis, evaluation,\r\ninterpretation, and dissemination. Collection, to be consistently\r\neffective, calls for specific directives to, or requests on, the\r\nappropriate collecting agencies. Analysis determines the source of the\r\ninformation and the circumstances under which it was obtained.\r\nEvaluation determines its degree of reliability. Interpretation\r\nconsists of drawing conclusions; when information thus takes the form\r\nof facts (so far as they can be ascertained) and of sound conclusions\r\ndrawn therefrom, it becomes military (naval) intelligence. It is then\r\ndisseminated to those concerned and is used in the solution of the\r\ncommander's own problems.\r\n\r\nThe basis for collection of such data is the determination of the\r\nessential elements of information desired by the commander. The\r\nnotation of these essential elements, for later incorporation in his\r\ndirective(s), naturally constitutes a primary feature of his basic\r\nplan. The essential elements of information are frequently formulated\r\nas questions--e.g., Will the enemy do this? Is the enemy doing that?\r\nWhat are the principal topographic features of Y Island, with respect\r\nto so and so?\r\n\r\nThese questions cover the essential matters of perplexity as to enemy\r\ncourses of action and as to the characteristics of the theater. Each\r\nenemy course of action, for example, may provide the basis for a\r\nquestion; or, if the scope of the problem has narrowed sufficiently,\r\nsuch question may deal with one of the enemy's possible operations,\r\nrelated to a course of action which he may be pursuing or is known to\r\nbe pursuing.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the essential elements of information, the commander\r\nprovides for proper reconnaissance activities by the several\r\ncollecting agencies under his command, or for appropriate requests to\r\nbe made by him on other collecting agencies. A sound plan will always\r\nmake adequate provision for such measures.\r\n\r\nThese subjects are treated in more detail in the later discussion\r\n(page 177) of intelligence problems.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn connection with freedom of action, the commander will also make\r\nadequate provision for logistics support. In its unrestricted sense,\r\nthe term \"logistics\" relates to the supply and movement of a military\r\nforce, and to such related matters as the disposition and replacement\r\nof ineffective personnel. Logistics measures, as comprehended in the\r\ndevelopment of the basic plan, exclude movement primarily of a\r\nstrategical or tactical nature, but include movement related primarily\r\nto supply and similar matters. This requirement gives rise to the\r\nnecessity for logistics measures which may further call for operations\r\nsuch as to provide fuel oil and supplies at rendezvous X and Y, and\r\ntender facilities at port D. An incidental requirement will relate to\r\nmovements of train ships. Hence, the commander formulates these, also,\r\nand includes them in his list of operations for later assignment as\r\nlogistics tasks. (Page 166). Fuel oil may likewise be required at Port\r\nD, but if the commander knows that ample fuel oil is in store there,\r\nno operation to cover this feature is required of him.\r\n\r\nThe solution of logistics problems is further discussed hereafter\r\n(page 179).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe commander has now, it may be presumed, evolved all of the\r\noperations that his analysis tells him are appropriate with respect to\r\ncorrect physical objectives, advantageous relative positions, and\r\nfreedom of action. Therefore, he now studies all of these operations\r\nfrom the viewpoint of the remaining element--proper apportionment of\r\nfighting strength. This consideration involves, initially, a\r\ndetermination of what forces will be necessary to carry out the\r\noperations listed. The commander thereby determines the requirements,\r\nas to forces, for each such operation.\r\n\r\nFor example, the operation \"to locate an enemy force\" may require the\r\nuse of several types of naval vessels and aircraft. The commander\r\ndetermines what method of search is best for the purposes of this\r\nspecific operation; thereafter, he determines what forces are\r\nnecessary to conduct the search. The procedure has previously been\r\nindicated (in the Principle of the Proper Means to be Made\r\nAvailable--page 34).\r\n\r\nIn this study the commander will often find it necessary to divide\r\nsome of the more extensive operations into component parts, suitable\r\nfor later assignment as tasks for subordinates. Fundamentally, there\r\nis no difference between an operation and a task, except that the\r\nlatter includes also the idea of imposing on another person, or\r\nassigning to him, a definite amount of work or duty (page 84). At this\r\nstage, then, the commander deals with components suitable for\r\nperformance by available weapons, in the usual units, or combinations\r\nof units, in which they are effective. Of course, when an operation\r\nmeets this requirement without subdivision into components, it need\r\nnot be subdivided.\r\n\r\nThese component parts are not yet actually tasks, because the\r\ncommander does not plan to assign them at this time to any one for\r\nexecution. However, the components are visualized as clearly, and are\r\nformulated as definitely, as is possible at this point. The\r\nrequirement is that they be acts that available forces can perform.\r\n\r\nThe method of breaking down an operation into component parts is one\r\nof analysis and deduction. Having visualized the manner whereby the\r\noperation can contribute to the accomplishment of the effort, the\r\ncommander has now to determine the means to be employed to this end.\r\nExperience and knowledge tell him what numbers and types of ships,\r\naircraft, and other weapons, if properly employed, will attain the\r\neffect desired.\r\n\r\nEach component part will indicate both the action and the physical\r\nobjectives of the action. For each component, the commander estimates\r\nwhat forces are required. He knows the extent of the armed forces\r\navailable, and he can, if his total force is adequate, adjust matters\r\nto allow each component a force capable of carrying it out.\r\n\r\nFor example, a component operation might call for a search by\r\ndestroyers, but the commander might find that his destroyers were in\r\nsuch poor relative position as to prevent them from reaching the point\r\nof origin in time. Therefore he would be unable to conduct the search\r\nby using destroyers alone. He might now consider a search by aircraft.\r\nA study of this proposal might indicate that it could be carried out\r\nin part by aircraft, but that available aircraft were inadequate to\r\ncarry it out in its entirety. In such event, consideration would be in\r\norder of the possibility of conducting this search by use of other\r\nforces also, e.g., submarines and cruisers.\r\n\r\nIn case the commander believes an indicated operation to be\r\ninfeasible, he first restudies that operation to see whether he can\r\nmodify it, without adversely affecting the accomplishment of the\r\neffort. He may even find that he can eliminate it by including its\r\nessential features in some other operation.\r\n\r\nIf the commander finds that his forces are inadequate for the\r\naccomplishment of an effort in one stage, but that they are adequate\r\nfor its accomplishment in successive stages, he may draw a conclusion\r\nas to which of the operations he can carry out first. On this basis,\r\nhe may proceed with the formulation of tasks to include these\r\noperations, leaving the remainder to a future time (see page 56).\r\n\r\nIt may be that all operations set down cannot be accomplished by the\r\nforces available, but that they will be possible of accomplishment if\r\nother forces are provided. This knowledge, of the sum total of forces\r\nrequired for the action indicated in the Decision, is an essential. It\r\nis only by such a searching inquiry that the commander ensures that\r\nthe operations resolved from the Decision will result in a full\r\nsolution of his problem. Usually the forces available will be found\r\nadequate, because the superior who provided them gave consideration,\r\non his part, to the requirements. However, if the forces available are\r\nnot deemed adequate, the commander either modifies the operations, or\r\nrestricts them, or subdivides them into parts for performance in\r\nsuccession by stages. In any such case, conditions permitting, he\r\nmakes constructive representations, together with a report of the\r\nfacts, to his superior (see page 103).\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting for Suitability, Feasibility, and Acceptability.\r\n\r\nEach of the operations finally deemed necessary or desirable is now\r\ntested as to its suitability, its feasibility, and its acceptability\r\nas to consequences. The considerations involved have been explained\r\npreviously (Section III of Chapter IV) and are therefore not repeated\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe testing process will eliminate those operations found not\r\nsuitable, feasible, or acceptable.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the tests may lead to the elimination of operations\r\nwhich, while both suitable and feasible, do not contribute enough\r\ntoward the accomplishment of the effort to warrant their retention.\r\nFor example, among the operations listed might be one to capture X\r\nisland and one to capture Y island, both suitable and feasible. The\r\ncommander, having analyzed these proposals, might conclude that the\r\ncapture of Y island would not constitute a sufficient contribution to\r\nwarrant its adoption as an operation at this time. Therefore, he might\r\nomit this operation, or he might defer it to a later stage.\r\n\r\nA feasible operation may similarly be rejected or deferred out of\r\npreference for another which can more readily be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe tests may also reveal important facts as to the relative\r\nconsequences with respect to costs. For example, two operations might\r\nboth be acceptable as to this factor, but one might be less acceptable\r\nthan the other. Accordingly, the less acceptable operation might be\r\nomitted, or might be deferred for the time being.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of the tests, all operations retained are listed\r\nfor further development.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Formulation of Tasks\r\n\r\nThe correct resolution of the Decision into the detailed operations\r\nrequired is further ensured by the visualization of these operations\r\nas tasks. Tasks so formulated (page 162), become a basis for the\r\npreparation of directives.\r\n\r\nTo prepare a plan as a basis for directives, or for use as such, the\r\ncommander first finds it desirable to formulate and assemble the\r\nvarious tasks. The tasks are formulated as a result of his study of\r\n(1) those operations which do not require to be broken down, and which\r\nmay now be rewritten as tasks, and of (2) the component parts of the\r\nmore extensive operations (See page 162, bottom).\r\n\r\nEach of the tasks, as now listed, is tested for suitability, for\r\nfeasibility, and for acceptability with respect to the consequences as\r\nto costs. In view of the fact that the operations have all been\r\nthoroughly tested, this process now becomes not a formal analysis but\r\nmerely a check.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Organization of Task Forces and Task Groups\r\n\r\nThe commander now classifies the tasks on the basis of their\r\nsuitability for accomplishment by appropriate task forces or\r\nsubdivisions thereof, i.e., task groups. In so doing he endeavors to\r\navoid forming any more classifications than are necessary for the\r\naccomplishment of the full effort.\r\n\r\nNote: In the remainder of this work, the term Task Group, except as\r\nmay otherwise be indicated, will be understood in the inclusive sense\r\nof either \"task force\" or \"task group\".\r\n\r\nTasks are assigned to task groups on the basis of such factors as the\r\nnature and geographical location of physical objectives, the existing\r\ndisposition of the several units, their capabilities, and their\r\nfreedom of action. The last-named may be the determinant, and,\r\nbecause of the importance of such considerations, tasks which would\r\notherwise fall to one group might be assigned to another. Features\r\ninfluencing a change might include lack of training of the personnel\r\navailable in the first group, or the special qualifications of a\r\nparticular commander, or a justified desire to adhere to a previously\r\ndetermined permanent task organization.\r\n\r\nLogistics tasks, i.e., those requiring operations for placing\r\nlogistics measures in effect, require the same careful consideration\r\nas do combat tasks. (See page 162).\r\n\r\nCertain tasks apply to all of the task groups, or pertain to the\r\ngeneral conduct of the common effort. Among such may be provision for\r\nsecurity, for unity among the subdivisions, and for intelligence\r\nactivities (page 160). In order to avoid repetition, these tasks are\r\nassembled in one group.\r\n\r\nThe commander analyzes the requirements of fighting strength for each\r\ntask group. He then, from the means available to him, assigns the\r\nnecessary strength to each group, making adjustment between the\r\ntheoretical requirements and the actual strength available.\r\n\r\nHe is familiar with the types of vessels and aircraft constituting his\r\ncommand, and with their military characteristics; with the\r\ncapabilities and cooperative qualities of his commanders; with the\r\ndegree of training of his various units; and with the geographical\r\nlocation of physical objectives. He recognizes that each task requires\r\nadequate strength for its accomplishment. Because these requirements\r\nhave been thoroughly considered during the study of the effective\r\napportionment of fighting strength, he is able to make adjustments as\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe commander now fully organizes each classification of tasks and its\r\ncorresponding task group by naming the task group (or task force), by\r\nmaking notation of its composition and of the rank and name of its\r\ncommander, and then by listing the tasks of each group. The principal\r\ntask (or tasks) may be listed first, the other tasks following in the\r\norder of their importance. If preferred, the sequence of tasks may be\r\nchronological. Also, either major or minor tasks may be listed\r\nchronologically. (See pages 158 and 192).\r\n\r\nIf the chronological sequence of tasks is utilized, that fact, in\r\norder to avoid confusion, is clearly indicated.\r\n\r\nThus organized, the whole plan can be transferred almost bodily into\r\nthe Order Form (Chapter VIII).\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication of the Fundamental Military Principle to the Determination\r\nof Objectives Embodied in Tasks\r\n\r\nIn formulating tasks for the several task groups, the commander has\r\nnow visualized, for each such group, an objective (or objectives) for\r\nthe subordinate to attain. In selecting these objectives, the\r\ncommander has placed himself, mentally, in the subordinate's\r\nsituation, visualizing the problem which the subordinate is to solve.\r\nOn this basis the commander has apportioned the strength needed for\r\nthe attainment of the objectives assigned to his subordinates. This\r\nprocedure, of evident importance, is frequently one of considerable\r\ndifficulty, because a higher commander, lacking detailed information\r\nof the situation which may confront a subordinate cannot always\r\nanticipate all the obstacles to the latter's success.\r\n\r\nIn formulating tasks, and in apportioning strength, by the procedure\r\nalready described, the commander has applied the Fundamental Military\r\nPrinciple. Now, to ensure the practical adjustment of means to ends\r\n(page 66), the commander reviews the process in the light of that\r\nPrinciple, so that he may be assured that he has selected a correct\r\nobjective (or objectives) for each subordinate. By using the tests\r\nindicated in the Principle, the commander confirms the suitability of\r\neach objective so selected, satisfies himself of its feasibility of\r\nattainment, and assures himself that the costs involved will be\r\nacceptable. If these requirements cannot be so satisfied, necessary\r\nadjustments are in order.\r\n\r\nThese tests may frequently be of a routine nature, by reason of the\r\nprevious painstaking tests of the several operations involved.\r\nHowever, such final tests cannot be omitted without incurring the\r\ndanger of selecting incorrect objectives for subordinates to attain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of Measures for Freedom of Action\r\n\r\nHaving completed the classification of his tasks, the commander next\r\nassembles the measures determined upon as necessary for ensuring\r\nadequate freedom of action.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject matter is not too bulky, these measures are\r\nincorporated in their proper place in the basic plan. Otherwise,\r\ninstructions as to these matters will be issued as annexes.\r\n\r\nThe various measures are assembled under the classification shown\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n    (a) Measures required for security, for cooperation, and for\r\n        intelligence activities.\r\n\r\n    (b) Measures for logistics support. These cover provision for\r\n        procurement and replenishment of supplies, disposition and\r\n        replacement of ineffective personnel, satisfactory\r\n        material maintenance, sanitation, battle casualties, and\r\n        the like.\r\n\r\n    (c) Measures for the exercise of command. These include\r\n        provision for communications, location of rendezvous, zone\r\n        time to be used, and the location of the commander.\r\n\r\nThis classification corresponds to that used in the Order Form (page\r\n193). Experience has indicated that such a classification facilitates\r\nthe transmission of instructions to subordinate commanders.\r\n\r\nIf desired, the material which will be required to be incorporated in\r\nparagraph (1) of the Order Form (see pages 190, 191, 219 and 221) may\r\nbe also assembled at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Preparation of Subsidiary Plans\r\n\r\nAs previously noted (page 106), certain subsidiary problems require\r\nthe preparation of subsidiary plans to be included with the directive\r\nas annexes. In broad strategical estimates, the solution of such\r\nsubsidiary problems involves a vast amount of mental effort; even in\r\nrestricted estimates, these problems may require most intensive\r\nthought. It is therefore appropriate at this point to discuss, in some\r\ndetail, the nature of these subsidiary problems.\r\n\r\nDuring the solution of his basic problem and later, during the process\r\nof evolving his basic plan, the commander may become aware of the need\r\nfor further action of a supporting nature with respect to his basic\r\nmission, distinct from that which he intends to assign as tasks to\r\nsubordinate commanders. If the nature of this action involves\r\nperplexity, he will be confronted with new problems to be solved. When\r\nhe recognizes that such problems exist and are to be solved by\r\nhimself, this awareness is a recognition of the incentive.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of these problems may involve a battle in which the\r\nentire force will participate, or perhaps a sortie requiring\r\ncoordination of the several subdivisions of his force. Others will be\r\nconcerned with measures recognized as necessary for ensuring freedom\r\nof action.\r\n\r\nThese problems give rise to the subsidiary plans previously referred\r\nto (page 106). They are not necessarily subsidiary in importance; even\r\nthe Battle Plan, the basis for the culmination of tactical effort, may\r\nresult from the solution of a subsidiary problem. The word\r\n\"subsidiary\", as here used, merely indicates that the problem has its\r\norigin in the commander's own Decision.\r\n\r\nWhen the incentive is thus recognized during the solution of the\r\nbasic problem or during the second step, the commander solves these\r\nnew problems, and includes their solutions as a part of the directives\r\nprepared for the carrying out of the basic plan. As will be seen later\r\n(Chapter VIII), there is a prescribed place for such solutions in the\r\nusual form in which directives are issued. Often, however, because of\r\nextent and bulk, these solutions are included with the directives as\r\nannexes.\r\n\r\nThe commander will desire to provide for all contingencies, but he can\r\nrarely, during the planning stage, see completely into the future, so\r\nas to foretell all pertinent events which may befall. During the\r\nunfolding of events, therefore, unforeseen subsidiary problems will\r\nprobably arise. Whether visualized during planning, or encountered\r\nduring the execution of the plan, these problems have the same\r\nrelationship with the basic problem. Reference is later made (Chapter\r\nIX) to subsidiary problems which arise during the action.\r\n\r\nSubsidiary problems, according to their nature in each case, may be\r\nsolved by the procedure distinctive of the first step or by that\r\ndistinctive of the second. In many instances either may be applicable,\r\nthe choice being a matter of convenience.\r\n\r\nBattle Plans, for example, can demonstrably be formulated by the use\r\nof either procedure. Thus, a Decision \"to destroy the enemy in a\r\ndaylight fleet engagement\" may be used as the basis for an Estimate of\r\nthe Situation, by the procedure distinctive of the first step, in\r\norder to reach a decision as to the plan, in outline, for the\r\ncontemplated engagement. However, the same result can also be attained\r\nthrough the procedure distinctive of the second step, with the basic\r\nDecision as the point of departure.\r\n\r\nA solution also can be reached by a method which is, in effect,\r\nintermediate between the procedures of the first and second steps. For\r\nexample, the basic (broad strategical) Decision noted above can be\r\ntaken, in a detailed tactical Estimate, as the only suitable,\r\nfeasible, and acceptable course of action. Then, in Section IV of the\r\nEstimate, a study of the more detailed operations involved can be\r\ndeveloped into an outlined plan for the battle. Thus, a single course\r\nof action, expanded to include the outlined plan so developed, can\r\nthen be adopted as the decision and can in turn be expanded by\r\nsecond-step methods into a detailed tactical plan.\r\n\r\nOn the grounds of simplicity, the procedure distinctive of the second\r\nstep is preferable, when it is applicable to the particular problem.\r\nTherefore, when a subsidiary plan is to be developed directly from a\r\nbasic Decision, this is frequently the better procedure. This comment\r\nis applicable not only to battle plans but also to other subsidiary\r\nplans such as sortie plans, entrance plans, and logistics plans. The\r\ncommander may find it necessary, however, to expand the study of\r\nfighting strength made in Section I-B of the basic estimate, in order\r\nto obtain the detailed data needed for formulating the subsidiary\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the relative simplicity of the second-step method, cases\r\noccur where the procedure of the first step is nevertheless\r\npreferable. For example, a basic Decision making provision for a major\r\ncampaign, divided into stages of some scope, may involve, as part of\r\none of these stages, an operation to capture an island. Such an\r\noperation may itself require a considerable effort on the part of the\r\nwhole force; yet the operation may be so specialized or localized, or\r\nboth, with reference to the entire effort contemplated in the basic\r\nDecision, that the solution of this subsidiary problem can best be\r\naccomplished through the procedure distinctive of the first step.\r\n\r\nThe commander will therefore necessarily be the judge, in each case,\r\nas to the particular procedure to be adopted.\r\n\r\nThere are wide variations in the requirements of the Estimate Form,\r\nwhen used for the solution of subsidiary problems. This is natural\r\nbecause these problems vary widely in nature. They include, on the one\r\nhand, problems dealing directly with the conflict of armed forces, for\r\nwhich the Form is especially designed. On the other hand, these\r\nproblems include those dealing with the factors related to freedom of\r\naction. To be suitable for this purpose, the Form requires\r\nmodification in varying degrees. Certain examples are included in the\r\nlatter part of this chapter (page 176 and following).\r\n\r\nThe application of the procedure of the first step to the solution of\r\nsuch subsidiary problems requires provision for deriving, in each\r\ncase, a (subsidiary) mission appropriate to the problem. Of the two\r\nelements of the mission, the (subsidiary) purpose is first determined,\r\nbecause the (subsidiary) task will necessarily be suitable to the\r\n(subsidiary) purpose. These elements of the (subsidiary) mission may\r\nbe obtained from one or more of the operations into which the basic\r\nDecision has been resolved. They may also be obtained from a preceding\r\nsubsidiary problem, already solved.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the preceding, discussion is first centered on a\r\nstrategical problem of usual type, involving a subsidiary tactical\r\nproblem calling for the detailed employment of weapons in a naval\r\nengagement. Other illustrations will deal with subsidiary problems\r\nrelating to particular aspects of freedom of action.\r\n\r\nIn the first example it is supposed that the commander has already\r\nsolved a basic problem of broad strategical scope, and has arrived at\r\na Decision which contemplates an engagement. A further logical act of\r\nplanning is now to develop a Battle Plan. Such development involves\r\nthe solution of a subsidiary problem. In this case the commander is\r\nsupposed to have found it desirable to solve this subsidiary problem\r\nby the procedure distinctive of the first step.\r\n\r\nIn this problem, the situation summarized is an imaginary one. It may\r\neventuate either through the natural future developments of the\r\nsituation existing at the time of the solution of the basic problem,\r\nor it may confront the commander during the execution of the plans\r\nderived from the Decision of that (basic) problem. The Battle Plan\r\nfinally to be formulated will be for use under the conditions assumed\r\nin this situation.\r\n\r\nThe commander will desire to draw up a Battle Plan as a provision for\r\nthe situation which he believes most likely to eventuate. However, as\r\nhe cannot be certain that this situation will occur, he may also\r\ndesire to assume other situations, i.e., prepare in advance for other\r\ncontingencies. It is then necessary for him to solve several problems,\r\neach differing from the others in the assumptions (page 155) as to the\r\nform the situation may take. The summary of the situation therefore\r\nrequires a brief statement of the conditions which are assumed. In\r\naddition, such parts of the basic problem may be included as are\r\ndeemed pertinent to the new problem in hand.\r\n\r\nIn his new problem the purpose of the (subsidiary) mission may readily\r\nbe obtained from the basic problem. Suppose the assigned task,\r\nmotivating the estimate of the basic problem, to have been to \"prevent\r\nenemy convoy from reaching destination\". This, the motivating task of\r\nthe basic problem, then becomes a suitable (subsidiary) purpose for\r\nthe mission of the subsidiary problem.\r\n\r\nFor the mission of the subsidiary problem, a motivating task, suitable\r\nto the purpose thus determined, will be found in the Decision of the\r\nbasic problem. Suppose the Decision in this case to have been \"to\r\ndestroy the enemy convoy\". The task thus determined for the subsidiary\r\nproblem becomes an assigned task in the sense that it is assigned by\r\nthe commander to himself, instead of to a subordinate; however, it is\r\nalso an assigned task in the sense that it has been indirectly\r\nassigned by the immediate superior, because it has been derived, in\r\nthe basic estimate, from the motivating task which was directly\r\nassigned by the superior.\r\n\r\nThe two elements, of task and purpose, when linked together, enable\r\nthe commander to visualize the appropriate effect desired, as the\r\nbasis for his subsidiary estimate,--a procedure identical with that\r\nfollowed in a basic estimate. As in the latter, the commander can now\r\nformulate his subsidiary mission, as:--\r\n\r\n    (Task) To destroy the enemy convoy,\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) in order to prevent it from reaching its\r\n    destination.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the subsidiary problem is thus seen to be identical\r\nwith the basic Decision linked to the purpose of that Decision.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not always the case. A subsidiary problem may merely\r\ninvolve the execution by the commander, i.e., under his own immediate\r\ndirection, of a designated part of his general plan. Or, such a\r\nproblem may involve execution, by the commander, of one or more of the\r\ndetailed operations for the accomplishment of his general plan or of a\r\npart thereof. The commander may also find it necessary to solve\r\nnumerous subsidiary problems of relatively restricted scope pertaining\r\neither to his general plan or to a part thereof or to the detailed\r\noperations involved.\r\n\r\nIn some of these cases the purpose of the subsidiary mission may be\r\nreadily apparent. In others, its nature may become clear only after\r\nthe application of considerable mental effort. In every case the\r\ndetermination of a proper (subsidiary) purpose involves visualization\r\nof a situation which the commander desires to bring about or to\r\nmaintain. The (subsidiary) task, appropriate to the (subsidiary)\r\npurpose, will always necessarily be suitable to the latter. This task\r\nis then the motivating task for the solution of the particular\r\nsubsidiary problem in hand. This will be the case whether the\r\ncommander makes a simple mental solution or produces a more complex\r\none in which the formal written estimate of the situation is employed.\r\nIn the former instance, the brevity of the mental process tends to\r\nobscure this fact.\r\n\r\nAn example might occur in a situation where the commander has received\r\nan order to \"Protect the base at A\". It is then supposed that, after\r\nestimating the situation, he has reached the Decision \"to deny the\r\nenemy the use of base sites within effective bombing range of A\", the\r\npurpose of the Decision being, of course, \"in order to protect the\r\nbase at A\". The action required might then be undertaken in two\r\nstages. The first stage might be confined to the area ABCD. If, then,\r\nall available base sites in this area, except Y island, were already\r\nsecurely in friendly hands, the commander would find it necessary to\r\nmake provision for an operation to deny the use of this island to the\r\nenemy. If this operation is of such a nature that the commander\r\ndesires to execute it under his own direct control, instead of\r\nassigning it to a subordinate, it presents a subsidiary problem which\r\nthe commander, himself, has to solve.\r\n\r\nThe commander has now determined the necessity of solving a subsidiary\r\nproblem relating to the accomplishment of a designated part of his\r\ngeneral plan. He has also determined the necessity of solving another\r\nsubsidiary problem presented by an operation pertaining to the first\r\nstage of the accomplishment of his general plan.\r\n\r\nEach subsidiary problem requires an estimate of the situation although\r\n\"the brevity of the mental process tends to obscure this fact\" (page\r\n172).\r\n\r\nIn making his basic estimate, the commander may have discovered the\r\nneed for these subsidiary estimates. In this case, he may have\r\nincluded them in his estimate, as \"estimates within the estimate\"\r\n(page 83), in his analysis of the operations involved in the various\r\ncourses of action which he considered. For instance, his basic\r\nDecision may have included the capture of Y island, and he may have\r\ncovered this feature by a corollary to that Decision, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Corollary: As a first stage, to deny the enemy the use of\r\n    available base sites in the area ABCD, by capturing Y island.\r\n\r\nHowever, the commander may not discover the desirability or need of\r\nsolving these subsidiary problems until the second step, when\r\nresolving the basic Decision into the detailed operations required. In\r\nthis case, he might make due provision at that time for the operations\r\ninvolved in the subsidiary problems. The mental procedure would be the\r\nsame in either event.\r\n\r\nThe commander may find, however, that he prefers to make a separate,\r\nsubsidiary estimate with respect to the determination of the stages of\r\nhis operation, including the details as to the performance of the\r\nfirst stage. In this case he finds a proper mission for his subsidiary\r\nestimate in the basic Decision, linked to its purpose. This mission\r\nwould be as follows:--\r\n\r\n    (Task) To deny the enemy the use of base sites within\r\n    effective bombing range of A,\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) in order to protect the base at A.\r\n\r\nDuring the subsidiary estimate the commander may discover, in his\r\nstudy of the area ABCD, the necessity for an operation to deny Y\r\nisland to the enemy, and may even go so far, in this study, as to\r\ndecide on the capture of this island. The decision, settling on this\r\narea as the scene of the first stage of his effort, may then include\r\nprovision for the capture of the island, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Decision: To deny the enemy the use of base sites in the area\r\n    ABCD as a first stage toward denying him the use of all base\r\n    sites within effective bombing range of the base at A.\r\n\r\n    Corollary: To capture Y island.\r\n\r\nHowever, the commander may not take up the matter of denying Y island,\r\nspecifically, to enemy use until he studies the detailed operations\r\nrequired for the accomplishment of the action involved in his first\r\nstage. In such event, he may make provision for the capture of the\r\nisland in his subsidiary plan for the execution of the first stage. He\r\nmay find, on the other hand, that he prefers to make a separate,\r\nsubsidiary estimate as to this feature. If so, the mission for this\r\nsubsidiary estimate would be identical with the decision (less the\r\ncorollary, but plus the purpose of the estimate), i.e.,--\r\n\r\n    (Task) To deny the enemy the use of base sites within\r\n    effective bombing range of the area ABCD as a first stage\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) toward denying him the use of all base sites within\r\n    effective bombing range of the base at A.\r\n\r\nDuring this estimate the commander considers the various courses of\r\naction whereby he can deny to the enemy all bases in the area of the\r\nfirst stage. Concluding that Y island is the only base site not\r\nsecurely in friendly hands, and that the best method of denying it to\r\nthe enemy is to capture it himself, he reaches a decision as follows:\r\n\r\n    Decision: To capture Y island, in order to deny to the enemy\r\n    the use of the only available base site in the area ABCD.\r\n\r\nIn each of the foregoing cases, the commander is said to have\r\n\"deduced\" the mission for his subsidiary problem. As has been\r\ndemonstrated, the process of deduction is merely the application of\r\nthe natural mental processes through the use of the estimate of the\r\nsituation. Whether the estimate is formal or informal, detailed or\r\nbrief, written or mental, is immaterial; in any case, the estimate\r\nresults in a decision which provides, with its purpose, a proper\r\nmission for the succeeding problem which has been presented by\r\nsolution of its predecessors.\r\n\r\nIn logical sequence, from problem to problem, the procedure outlined\r\nin the preceding discussion enables the commander to derive a correct\r\nmission for the problem involving the capture of Y Island. Clear\r\nvisualization of such a subsidiary mission is frequently of great\r\nimportance, and may be difficult unless the procedure has been\r\ncarefully traced from each problem to the next. In this particular\r\nexample, if the commander finds that the capture of Y Island is of\r\nsuch a specialized and localized nature (page 170) as to call for a\r\nformal estimate (as may frequently be the case in capturing a\r\nwell-defended island base), he will be especially desirious of\r\nderiving a correct (subsidiary) mission as a basis for this estimate.\r\nIn this instance a correct mission would be:--\r\n\r\n    (Task) To capture Y Island,\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) in order to deny to the enemy the use of the only\r\n    available base site in the area ABCD.\r\n\r\nThis mission is identical with the decision, linked to its purpose, of\r\nthe preceding subsidiary problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSubsidiary problems relating to training (page 160), when solved by\r\nthe procedure distinctive of the first step, involve estimates of the\r\nsituation very similar to those explained previously (Chapter VI).\r\n\r\nSection I-A of such a training estimate will include a summary of the\r\nsalient features of the existing situation, from the strategical or\r\ntactical viewpoint, together with a statement of the salient features\r\nof the operations to be carried out for which the projected training\r\nis designed. The incentive will be found in a previous decision\r\ncalling for the operations which require the training to be given. The\r\nassigned objective will be the making of adequate provision for\r\ntraining appropriate to the projected operations. The (subsidiary)\r\nmission will be:--\r\n\r\n    (Task) to provide appropriate training,\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) in order to contribute to freedom of action during\r\n    the operations contemplated. (In each particular case the\r\n    operations contemplated will be indicated by proper\r\n    phraseology in the mission or by reference to the preceding\r\n    summary of the situation.)\r\n\r\nSection I-B of a training estimate will take account of the training\r\nfactors cited in the Estimate Form (Chapter VI) for a basic problem,\r\nbut will specify details with respect to both own and enemy forces.\r\nThis section will also cover existing facilities for training, as well\r\nas the characteristics of the theater which have now or may have a\r\nbearing on the training to be given.\r\n\r\nSection II will discuss the various possible procedures for affording\r\nthe appropriate training.\r\n\r\nSection III will deal with any measures which may be adopted by the\r\nenemy (through actual attack, through propaganda, or any other\r\nmethods) to hinder or prevent the desired training.\r\n\r\nSection IV will be devoted to the selection of the best training\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nSection V will state the decision as to the essentials of the training\r\nto be given and as to the method of giving the training. The decision\r\nwill be in such detail as to constitute a general plan, or a proper\r\nbasis therefor, from which a detailed plan may be developed.\r\n\r\nA detailed training plan, developed from the foregoing decision, will\r\nassemble the necessary information and assumptions, will state the\r\ngeneral plan for training, and will prescribe the appropriate training\r\ntasks. It will also include any proper coordinating measures, make\r\nprovision for the logistics of the training plan, and finally provide\r\nfor the exercise of command and for supervision over the training.\r\n\r\nA training plan may be briefed by annexing appropriate\r\ndocuments,--e.g., a program and a schedule. The commander will\r\nordinarily issue a schedule for training to be given under his own\r\nsupervision; he will usually issue a program for training to be given\r\nby his subordinates, who will in turn prepare their own schedules.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSubsidiary problems involving intelligence (page 160), when solved by\r\nthe procedure distinctive of the first step, call for an intelligence\r\nestimate along the lines indicated, in general, in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nSection I-A of the Estimate will include a summary of the salient\r\nfeatures of the present situation and of the contemplated strategical\r\nand tactical operations. The incentive, to be found in a previous\r\ndecision of the commander, will be noted. The assigned objective will\r\nbe the making of provision for adequate intelligence of the enemy and\r\nof the theater of operations. The mission will be:--\r\n\r\n    (Task) To make provision for adequate intelligence of the\r\n    enemy and of the theater of operations,\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) in order to contribute to freedom of action in the\r\n    operations contemplated.\r\n\r\nSection I-B of the intelligence estimate will take account of the\r\nfactors as to intelligence and as to related matters which are noted\r\nin the Estimate Form (Chapter VI) for a basic estimate.\r\n\r\nSection II will consider the possible procedures for obtaining\r\ninformation, i.e., for its collection, including reports from\r\ncollecting agencies.\r\n\r\nSection III will consider the capabilities of the enemy as to\r\ncounter-intelligence measures.\r\n\r\nSection IV will compare the various procedures open for the collection\r\nof information and for reports thereof.\r\n\r\nSection V will include a decision as to the essential elements of\r\ninformation desired. The decision will be in sufficient detail to\r\nserve as a general plan (or a basis therefor), to be developed into a\r\ndetailed plan for obtaining information and for converting it into\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nA detailed intelligence plan will include appropriate information and\r\nassumptions. It will state the general plan for obtaining\r\nintelligence. This statement will include the essential elements of\r\ninformation desired. The plan will include appropriate tasks for\r\ninformation-collecting agencies, with times and destinations for\r\nreports of information. The task for each collecting agency will be\r\nbased on the general plan (above); such task will also be\r\nsynchronized with the projected operations prescribed for such agency\r\nin current Operation Orders (Chapter VIII). The agency's inherent\r\ncapabilities--its limitations as well as its powers--will be given\r\ndue consideration. Requests to be made on collecting agencies not\r\nunder the commander's control will be noted in the information (as to\r\nown forces) given in the plan (see above).\r\n\r\nLogistics arrangements will include, for example, provisions for\r\nhandling prisoners of war, the disposition of captured documents and\r\nother materials, and the supply of maps, charts, and photographs.\r\nCounter intelligence measures will be specified where applicable.\r\nThese include such matters as censorship, press relations, camouflage,\r\nand propaganda. Finally, the plan will include provision for the\r\nrendition of routine and special reports, for special charts (or maps)\r\naccompanying or pertinent to such reports, and for any intelligence\r\nconferences.\r\n\r\nThe essential elements of information desired are frequently stated in\r\nquestion form. Each question deals with an enemy course of action or\r\nwith one or more of the enemy operations pertaining to such a course\r\n(page 161).\r\n\r\nThe tasks assigned to collecting agencies, or the requests made on\r\ncollecting agencies not under the commander's control, will call for\r\ninformation (negative, if desired, as well as positive) as to specific\r\nindications of the enemy's action--past, present, or intended--and of\r\nthe characteristics of the theater as related thereto. The indications\r\nto be sought for and reported are carefully determined by the\r\ncommander in expectation that information obtained as to such matters\r\nwill enable him to draw conclusions which will answer the questions\r\nposed by the essential elements of information.\r\n\r\nFor example, essential elements of information, with corresponding\r\nindications, may be as follows:\r\n\r\nEssential Elements               Indications\r\n\r\n1. Will the enemy patrol the     a. Presence or absence of enemy\r\n   trade route from A to B?         forces (number and types of\r\n                                    vessels) between meridians--and--,\r\n                                    as far north as--and as far\r\n                                    south as--.\r\n\r\n                                 b. Times enemy forces observed\r\n                                    in area noted.\r\n\r\n                                 c. Apparent activity of enemy\r\n                                    forces so noted.\r\n\r\n2. Will the enemy cover focal    a. Presence or absence of enemy\r\n   points M and N?                  forces (numbers and types of\r\n                                    vessels) in (a specified area\r\n                                    or areas).\r\n\r\n                                 b. Times enemy forces observed\r\n                                    in areas noted in a, above.\r\n\r\n                                 c. Apparent activity of enemy so\r\n                                    noted.\r\n\r\n                                 d. Has M or N been prepared\r\n                                    as a naval base; an air base\r\n                                    for seaplanes, for land planes?\r\n                                    Is M or N readily accessible to\r\n                                    enemy battleships? What are\r\n                                    the characteristics of the\r\n                                    available entrances to sheltered\r\n                                    anchorages? (Etc.)\r\n\r\nAnother type of subsidiary problem which may call for a separate\r\nsubsidiary plan relates to logistics (page 162). This problem is\r\nparticularly applicable to the planning stage, because the\r\ncontingencies which it involves can, to a considerable degree, be\r\nforeseen. In this case the situation which the commander usually\r\ndesires to bring about is adequate freedom of action with respect to\r\nsupply and related matters. He wishes to solve this problem so\r\ncompletely during the present step that a logistics plan, concurrently\r\nexecuted with his basic plan, will require minimum subsequent\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nA logistics estimate by the procedure distinctive of the first step\r\nwill include in Section I-A a summary of the pertinent features of the\r\nexisting strategical and tactical situation, and of contemplated\r\nstrategical and tactical operations. It will also include a statement\r\nof the salient features of the existing logistics situation. The\r\nincentive, to be found in a previous decision of the commander, will\r\nbe noted. The assigned objective will be the making of adequate\r\nprovision for logistics support. The mission will be:--\r\n\r\n    (Task) to make provision for adequate logistics support,\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) in order to contribute to freedom of action in the\r\n    operations contemplated. (In each particular case the\r\n    operations contemplated will be indicated by proper\r\n    phraseology in the mission or by reference to the summary of\r\n    the situation).\r\n\r\nSection I-B of the estimate will take account of the logistics factors\r\ncited in the Estimate Form (Chapter VI) for a basic estimate, but will\r\nspecify details to the further extent necessary.\r\n\r\nSection II will discuss the various possible procedures for affording\r\nappropriate logistics support of the various categories.\r\n\r\nSection III will discuss enemy actions to hamper or prevent adequate\r\nlogistics support.\r\n\r\nSection IV will deal with selection of the best logistics procedure.\r\n\r\nSection V will state the decision as to the essential elements of the\r\nlogistics support to be afforded, in such detail as will constitute a\r\ngeneral plan (or a proper basis therefor) from which a detailed plan\r\ncan be developed.\r\n\r\nA detailed logistics plan, developed from the foregoing estimate, will\r\nassemble the necessary information and assumptions. It will state the\r\ngeneral plan for logistics support. It will then provide for\r\nappropriate action as to each type of logistics support, or will state\r\nproper tasks for the several subdivisions of the force concerned\r\ntherewith. It will include, also, any coordinating measures. It will,\r\nfinally, make provision for exercise of command with reference to\r\nlogistics support, as well as for any necessary or desirable time\r\nelements and similar considerations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom all of the foregoing discussions it is apparent that the numerous\r\npossible subsidiary problems are all related to the basic problem\r\neither directly or through an intervening subsidiary problem. The\r\nnature of this relationship is seen through the (subsidiary) purpose,\r\ndetermined for the particular (subsidiary) task; therefore, the\r\nunderstanding of the problem involves a statement or visualization of\r\nthe (subsidiary) purpose in each case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXERCISE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT\r\nIN THE EXECUTION OF THE PLAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE INAUGURATION OF THE PLANNED ACTION\r\n\r\n(The Third Step--The Formulation and Issue of Directives)\r\n\r\n    In the discussion which now follows, it is demonstrated that,\r\n    if the second step (Chapter VII) has been carried through\r\n    completely, the formulation of directives requires only the\r\n    completion of details of the Order Form, which is explained.\r\n    The various types of naval plans and directives are also\r\n    described.\r\n\r\n\r\nScope of the Third Step. As previously stated (in Chapter V, on page\r\n107), the inauguration of the planned action (the third step) begins\r\nwhen the commander forms the intention of immediately promulgating, as\r\none or more directives, his solution of the problem represented by the\r\nsecond step. The third step ends at the moment when the problem\r\nbecomes one of supervising the planned action in the course of its\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nMilitary Plans and Military Directives. A plan is a proposed scheme,\r\nprocedure, or method of action for the attainment of an objective. It\r\nis one of the essential links between decision and action.\r\n\r\nA directive, in the general sense, initiates or governs conduct or\r\nprocedure. It is the means by which one's will or intent is made known\r\nto others. Sometimes the word is employed as a synonym for \"order\"; at\r\nothers, it carries the significance of various instructions ranging\r\nfrom the simple to the complex; at still others, it denotes a plan\r\nformulated to be placed in effect in a particular contingency or when\r\nso directed. In all cases, a directive, to be suitable as a guide for\r\nothers, has as its origin a plan.\r\n\r\nThe words plan and directive are used herein as follows:--A plan may\r\nexist only in the mind. Even if formulated and set down in writing, it\r\nmay receive no distribution. A plan continues to be exclusively a plan\r\nso long as it concerns the originating commander alone, and it never\r\nloses its identity as a proposed procedure or method of action. When,\r\nhowever, the commander forms the intent of promulgating the plan\r\nimmediately, the plan becomes also a directive. At this point, as\r\nnoted in the preceding paragraph (\"Scope of the Third Step\"), the\r\nexecution phase begins, from the standpoint of the exercise of mental\r\npower, with the inauguration of the planned action.\r\n\r\nA directive may therefore be (1) an order effective upon receipt, in\r\nwhich case it may be an order placing in effect a plan already issued;\r\nor a directive may be (2) a formulated plan which the commander\r\nintends to issue immediately to his subordinates.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, certain written instruments prepared under the\r\ndesignation of plans are also included under the classification of\r\ndirectives. In the use of these terms hereinafter, the distinction\r\nbetween a plan viewed as a basis for a directive, and a plan intended\r\nto be promulgated as a directive, will be indicated in the context.\r\n\r\nWhether written or mental, the complete plan will cover the scope of\r\nthe Decision, and will be the commander's method of procedure for his\r\nfuture conduct of operations. A commander may, or may not, formulate\r\nhis complete plan in writing, or embody it in a formal directive which\r\nwill provide for the execution, in full, of the Decision of his\r\nestimate. He may find that his plan divides into several parts, and he\r\nmay make separate provision for the execution of each of these parts.\r\nWhile the integrity of a plan depends upon the soundness of its\r\nessential details, the plan is properly formulated as a directive or\r\ndirectives projected in detail, only so far into the future as the\r\ncommander's estimate of the situation assures him of reasonable\r\nfreedom of action (see page 57).\r\n\r\nWhere the commander divides his plan into parts for separate\r\naccomplishment, he will naturally exercise care that each part is, in\r\nitself, the suitable basis for a complete and homogeneous plan.\r\nSuccessful execution of all these plans results in the complete\r\naccomplishment of his Decision.\r\n\r\nDirectives required to further the success of a particular operation\r\nmay be issued without awaiting formulation of the entire plan. Parts\r\nof the plan may be transmitted as fragmentary directives to guide the\r\naction of subordinates in instantaneous or early execution. Such cases\r\nare far more frequent than are those in which a formal written plan,\r\nto guide either the operations in their entirety or a part thereof, is\r\nprepared and distributed as a directive. Effective action by the\r\nsubordinate is thus not delayed by the absence of complete written\r\ndirectives.\r\n\r\nThe commander, more especially during war, may be the only individual\r\nwho is conversant with the entire plan. He may consider that the\r\nnecessity for secrecy is paramount, or that there are features to\r\nwhose details he is unwilling to commit himself until the situation is\r\nclearer. However, he may usually expect to disclose its scope and\r\ngeneral features to his immediate superior, and the plan in its\r\nentirety to his next junior; or, in the interests of mutual\r\nunderstanding, to all his subordinates of the next lower echelon or\r\neven to his entire command. The scope of the plan also may be a\r\ndetermining factor. If the plan covers an entire campaign or an\r\nextended series of operations, its dissemination is less likely and\r\nless general than if it is concerned with only a minor operation.\r\n\r\nDuring peace, in exercises simulating war, the complete plan is\r\nfrequently given circulation for purposes of training.\r\n\r\nSubsidiary Plans. Subsidiary plans, discussed in Chapter VII (page\r\n168), are frequently issued as annexes to the Operation Plan (page\r\n196) which carries into effect the basic Decision. The commander will\r\nbe the judge as to whether alternative subsidiary plans are necessary\r\nor desirable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nEssentials of Military Directives.\r\n\r\nGeneral. By the issue of directives, a commander communicates to his\r\nsubordinates his plans or such parts of them as he desires. Directives\r\nmay be oral or written, or may be transmitted by despatch.\r\n\r\nWhether a directive is to be effective upon receipt, or under\r\nspecified conditions, or at a specific time, or upon further\r\ninstructions from the commander, will be evident from its nature, or\r\nwill be prescribed in the body of the directive itself.\r\n\r\nThe manner of determining the details of a plan has been discussed in\r\nChapter VII. The matter contained therein is pertinent to the\r\npreparation of a plan that is not to be issued as a directive as well\r\nas to one that is to be so issued.\r\n\r\nThe various categories of directives customarily employed in our naval\r\nservice, and standard forms for these, are described hereinafter.\r\n\r\nThe essentials of a military directive which is designed to govern the\r\nexecution of a plan are:\r\n\r\n    (a) That it indicate the general plan for the common effort\r\n        of the entire force.\r\n\r\n    (b) That it organize the force with a view to the effective\r\n        accomplishment of this plan.\r\n\r\n    (c) That it assign tasks to the subdivisions of the force,\r\n        such that the accomplishment of these tasks will result in\r\n        the accomplishment of the plan adopted for the entire\r\n        force.\r\n\r\n    (d) That it make appropriate provision for coordination among\r\n        subdivisions, for logistics support, and for the\r\n        collection of information and the dissemination of\r\n        intelligence, that it state the conditions under which the\r\n        plan is to become effective; and that it indicate the\r\n        location of the commander during the period of execution.\r\n\r\nSome of these essentials may have found their expression in previous\r\ninstructions, or may be unnecessary because of the state of mutual\r\nunderstanding. On the other hand, the directive may include annexes in\r\nthe form of alternative and subsidiary plans, letters of instructions\r\n(page 188), and other material designed to be of assistance in the\r\nintelligent accomplishment of the assigned task.\r\n\r\nIn issuing a directive, whether written or oral, except such a\r\nfragmentary order as has previously been described (page 184), a\r\ncommander has the following definite responsibilities:\r\n\r\n    (a) To ensure that subordinates understand the\r\n        situation,--therefore, to give them pertinent available\r\n        information.\r\n\r\n    (b) To set forth clearly the general plan to be carried out by\r\n        his entire force, as well as the tasks to be accomplished\r\n        by each subdivision of his force.\r\n\r\n    (c) To provide each of these subdivisions with adequate means\r\n        to accomplish its assigned task.\r\n\r\n    (d) To allow subordinate commanders appropriate discretion\r\n        within the limits of their assigned tasks, without,\r\n        however, sacrifice of the necessary coordination.\r\n\r\nHe will also bear in mind that a directive will best convey his will\r\nand intent and will be most easily understood by his subordinates if\r\nit is clear, brief, and positive.\r\n\r\nClarity demands the use of precise expressions susceptible of only the\r\ndesired interpretation. Normally, the affirmative form is preferable\r\nto the negative. The importance of clarity has been summed up in the\r\nsaying, \"An order which can be misunderstood will be misunderstood\".\r\nIf misunderstandings arise on the part of trained subordinates the\r\nchief fault often lies with the person who issued the directive.\r\n\r\nBrevity calls for the omission of superfluous words and of unnecessary\r\ndetails. Short sentences are ordinarily more easily and rapidly\r\nunderstood than longer ones. Brevity, however, is never to be sought\r\nat the expense of clarity. The attainment of brevity often requires\r\nconsiderable expenditure of effort and of time. But time is not to be\r\nsacrificed in the interests of obtaining brevity in directives, when\r\nthe proper emphasis should rather be on initiating early action.\r\n\r\nPositiveness of expression suggests the superior's fixity of purpose,\r\nwith consequent inspiration to subordinates to prosecute their tasks\r\nwith determination. The use of indefinite and weakening expressions\r\nleads to suspicion of vacillation and indecision. Such expressions\r\ntend to impose upon subordinates the responsibilities which belong to\r\nand are fully accepted by a resolute superior.\r\n\r\n\r\nRestatement of the Decision for Use in the Directive\r\n\r\nExcept where special considerations exist to the contrary, it will be\r\nfound that the expression of the Decision for use in a directive will\r\nmost clearly indicate the intent of the commander if stated in terms\r\nof the objective to be attained by his force (i.e., of the situation\r\nto be created or maintained) and of the outlined action for its\r\nattainment (page 104). Such expression is usually possible in problems\r\nof broad strategical scope (page 88). In other cases difficulty may be\r\nencountered. For instance, in tactical problems dealing with the\r\ndetailed employment of weapons, the action may necessarily be couched\r\nin the terms of a series of acts (see page 95).\r\n\r\nNo precise form is prescribed; thoughts clearly expressed are more\r\nimportant than form. It is customary to begin with \"This force (or\r\ngroup) will\", and then state with brevity the Decision as (and if)\r\nmodified, adding the motivating task which is the purpose of the\r\nDecision. The motivating task is connected with the preceding\r\nstatement by words such as \"in order to\", \"to assist in\", or\r\n\"preparatory to\", as the case may be.\r\n\r\nSince his original expression of the Decision in the first step\r\n(Chapter VI), the commander has studied the operations required to\r\ncarry it out. He therefore has gained a knowledge, which he did not\r\nthen have, of how his action is to be carried out. He may now be able\r\nto compile a brief of these operations, applicable to all of them and\r\ntherefore informative to all subordinate commanders. He may be able to\r\nsay how, or even where and when, the effort of his force will be\r\nexerted.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration, if his Decision is \"to destroy enemy battle-line\r\nstrength\", his operations might be described \"by gun action at long\r\nrange during high visibility\". Should the commander, solely for the\r\npurpose of making his intent clearer to his subordinate commanders,\r\nnow decide to include the latter phrase in the re-wording of his\r\nDecision, he may do so at this point.\r\n\r\nIt may sometimes be necessary to restate the Decision for another\r\nreason. It will be recalled that the commander is frequently obliged\r\nto recognize that he cannot carry out all of these operations, and\r\nthat he therefore decides to issue a directive to carry out certain\r\nones selected for the first stage (page 164). In such a case, he may\r\nnot now be able to use the full Decision as originally determined. In\r\nthat event he couches the Decision in terms of the partial\r\naccomplishment inherent in the operations to be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Forms for Plans and Directives\r\n\r\nForm. Experience has shown that military directives usually give best\r\nresults if cast in a standard form well known alike to originator and\r\nrecipient. Such a form tends to prevent the omission of relevant\r\nfeatures, and to minimize error and misunderstanding. However, a\r\ncommander may find that lack of opportunity to facilitate mutual\r\nunderstanding by personal conference requires that one or more\r\nsubordinates receive instructions in greater detail than a standard\r\nform seems to permit. A letter of instructions may then be\r\nappropriate. The commander himself is the best judge as to the\r\napplication of a form to his needs of the moment, and as to the\r\nnecessity for adherence to form in whatever particular.\r\n\r\nUseful as form is, it is important to keep in mind that it is the\r\nservant and not the master.\r\n\r\nThe standard form in use in our naval service, long known as the Order\r\nForm, is applicable, with certain modifications, to all written plans\r\nand directives.\r\n\r\nThe Order Form will now be described in detail from the standpoint of\r\nits general application to all classes of directives, including the\r\ncommander's written plan, whether or not promulgated as a directive.\r\n\r\nThe Order Form. Because of established usage, and for other reasons\r\nnoted hereinafter, it is desirable that certain clerical details be\r\nhandled as follows:\r\n\r\n    (a) To minimize errors, all numerals are spelled out, except\r\n        paragraph numbers and those in the heading.\r\n\r\n    (b) For emphasis, and to minimize errors, all geographical\r\n        names and names of vessels are spelled entirely with\r\n        capitals.\r\n\r\n    (c) To standardize arrangement and facilitate reading, a\r\n        narrow left-hand margin is left abreast the heading and\r\n        the task organization, and a wider margin is left abreast\r\n        the paragraphs.\r\n\r\n    (d) For the same reasons, the main paragraph numbers are\r\n        indented in the wider margin.\r\n\r\n    (e) For emphasis, the task-force or task-group titles of the\r\n        task organization, wherever occurring, are underlined.\r\n\r\nThe sequence in which the subject matter is presented is a logical\r\narrangement which experience has shown to be effective. Since every\r\nitem has a definite place in the form, formulation is simplified, and\r\nready reference is facilitated.\r\n\r\nIn a written directive, the prescribed paragraph numbering is always\r\nfollowed, even if no text is inserted after a number. This practice\r\nserves as a check against accidental omission, and as confirmatory\r\nevidence that omissions are intentional. For example, if there is no\r\nnew information to be disseminated, the paragraph number \"1\" is\r\nwritten in its proper place, followed by the words \"No further\r\ninformation\".\r\n\r\nWhen the subject matter to be presented under any one paragraph is\r\nvoluminous, it may be broken up into a number of subparagraphs. Except\r\nin paragraph 3, these subparagraphs are unlettered.\r\n\r\nThe Heading contains:\r\n\r\nIn the upper right-hand corner in the following sequence:\r\n\r\n    (a) The title of the issuing officer's command, such as\r\n        NORTHERN SCOUTS, or ADVANCED FORCE, etc., preceded by the\r\n        titles, in proper order within the chain of command, of\r\n        all superior echelons or of such higher echelons as will\r\n        ensure adequate identification.\r\n\r\n    (b) The name of the flagship, as U.S.S. AUGUSTA, Flagship.\r\n\r\n    (c) The place of issue: for example, NEWPORT, R.I., or, At\r\n        Sea, Lat. 34°-40' N., Long. 162°-20' W.\r\n\r\n    (d) The time of issue: that is, the month, day, year, and\r\n        hour; for example, July 12, 1935; 1100.\r\n\r\nIn the upper left-hand corner in the following sequence:\r\n\r\n    (e) The file notations and classification: SECRET or\r\n        CONFIDENTIAL, the classification being underlined and\r\n        spelled with capitals. This classification is repeated on\r\n        succeeding pages,\r\n\r\n    (f) The type and serial number of the directive, such as\r\n        Operation Plan No. 5, the words Operation Plan being\r\n        underlined. This is repeated on succeeding pages.\r\n\r\nThe Body. The task organization, which consists of a tabular\r\nenumeration of task forces or task groups, the composition of each,\r\nand the rank and name of its commander, is the beginning of the body\r\nof the directive. It is customary to omit the name of the issuing\r\nofficer from any task force or task group commanded by him. Any unit\r\nincluded in a force named in the task organization is, by virtue of\r\nthat fact, directed to act under the command of the commander of the\r\nspecified force.\r\n\r\nWhen so desired for additional ready identification, task forces and\r\ntheir subdivisions may be numbered. In our naval service, systematic\r\nmethods for such numerical designation are indicated from time to time\r\nby proper authority. Numerals for this purpose are entered in the task\r\norganization to the left of the title of each appropriate task force\r\nor subdivision thereof. The numerals may be placed in parentheses.\r\n\r\nThe directive is addressed for action solely to the commanders of the\r\ntask forces or task groups listed in the task organization.\r\n\r\nTrain vessels assigned exclusively to particular combatant task forces\r\nare listed among the units of those forces in the task organization.\r\nIf the directive is to be used for assigning tasks involving\r\nstrategical or tactical movement directly to the Train, or to any\r\nTrain units, such units are grouped together to form a separate task\r\nforce. If instructions to the Train are to be issued in another\r\ndirective, the Train need not appear as a separate force in the task\r\norganization. As a matter of general custom, the Train is usually not\r\nincluded as a task force unless it is to accompany, or act in tactical\r\nconcert with, some one or more of the combatant task forces listed.\r\n\r\nEach task force named in this table, together with its numerical\r\ndesignation, is preceded by a separate letter, (a), (b), (c), etc.,\r\nand its assigned task is set forth in a similarly lettered\r\nsubparagraph in paragraph 3.\r\n\r\nParagraph 1 is the information paragraph. It contains such available\r\ninformation of enemy and own forces as is necessary for subordinates\r\nto understand the situation and to cooperate efficiently. Paragraph 1\r\ncontains no part of the tasks assigned by the commander. Information\r\nof the enemy and that of own forces, and assumptions where pertinent,\r\nare usually set forth in separate unlettered subparagraphs.\r\n\r\nWhen deemed advisable, unless secrecy or other considerations forbid,\r\nparagraph 1 may include statements of the general plans of various\r\nhigher echelons in the chain of command. A statement of the general\r\nplan of the next higher commander will frequently be included. For the\r\nsame reasons, the commander will often include in this paragraph a\r\nstatement of his own assigned task, unless, of course, this point is\r\nadequately covered in the statement of his general plan in paragraph\r\n2. Inclusion of such matters may enable subordinates to gain a clearer\r\nvisualization of the relationships existing among the several\r\nobjectives envisaged by the higher command.\r\n\r\nTo promote cooperation, paragraph 1 may also state the principal tasks\r\nof coordinate forces of the commander's own echelon; for like reasons,\r\nthe principal tasks of other task forces of the command not listed in\r\nthe task organization may be included. Where the immediate superior\r\nhas prescribed particular methods to other forces for cooperation and\r\nsecurity, these may also be set forth as a matter of information. (See\r\npage 167.)\r\n\r\nIn this paragraph, distinction is drawn between information which is\r\nbased upon established facts, and that of merely probable accuracy.\r\nThe latter is not to be confused with assumptions which, in Operation\r\nPlans, are accepted as a basis. (See page 155.)\r\n\r\nWhen writing their own information paragraphs, subordinate commanders\r\ndo not necessarily copy verbatim the information contained in the\r\norder of their superior. Good procedure calls for them to digest that\r\ninformation, select what is essential, and present it with any\r\nadditional information considered necessary. Care is taken to include\r\nnecessary information of coordinate task forces.\r\n\r\nParagraph 2 states the general plan of the complete force under the\r\ncommand of the officer who issued the directive. If several directives\r\nare issued for carrying out a single, complete plan (see, for example,\r\ndiscussion of fragmentary orders, page 184), then paragraph 2 is\r\nusually the same in all of them. The amount of detail given in this\r\nparagraph is sufficient to ensure a clear comprehension by the\r\nsubordinates as to what is to be accomplished by the force as a whole.\r\nIt is customary to begin with the words, \"This force will\", followed\r\nby a statement of the general plan and, unless secrecy or other\r\nconsiderations forbid, by the purpose of the effort embodied therein.\r\n(See Restatement of the Decision, page 187).\r\n\r\nParagraph 3 assigns individual tasks to all of the task forces listed\r\nin the task organization. This paragraph is divided into as many\r\nsubparagraphs, (a), (b), (c), etc., as there are task forces\r\nenumerated in the task organization. Each subparagraph commences with\r\nthe designating letter in parentheses, followed by the title of the\r\ntask force, underlined.\r\n\r\nNormally the tasks for each task force are stated in order of their\r\nimportance. If preferred, however, the sequence of tasks may be\r\nchronological, i.e., in the order of their execution. Each method has\r\ncertain advantages, according to the nature of the situation. Where\r\nthe chronological sequence is utilized, that fact is clearly\r\nindicated, in order to avoid confusion. (See also page 166). After the\r\nstatement of the tasks, these subparagraphs conclude with such\r\ndetailed instructions as are necessary.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the entire force is listed in the task organization,\r\nthe proper formulation of tasks requires that the accomplishment of\r\nall the tasks of paragraph 3 result in the accomplishment of the\r\ngeneral plan set forth for the entire force in paragraph 2. On the\r\nother hand, where several directives are issued, each to a different\r\npart of the force, with a paragraph 2 common to all, then the\r\naccomplishment of the tasks of all of the paragraphs 3, of the several\r\ndirectives is properly equivalent to the accomplishment of the general\r\nplan prescribed in the common paragraph 2.\r\n\r\nWhere two or more task forces have identical task assignments, only\r\nthe common subparagraph need be written after the title of the task\r\nforces concerned, thus:\r\n\r\n    (a) Submarine Detachment,\r\n\r\n    (b) Air Patrol, (assignment of the common task or tasks).\r\n\r\nIf the Train has been included as a separate force of the task\r\norganization, it will be given its tasks as to tactical and\r\nstrategical movement in a separate subparagraph of paragraph 3.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid repetition, task assignments and instructions which\r\napply to all task forces, or which pertain to the general conduct of\r\nthe operation, are embodied in a final subparagraph, designated as\r\n3(x). It is particularly necessary that there be included in this\r\nsubparagraph the measures (e.g., as to cooperation, security,\r\nintelligence, and the like) pertaining to freedom of action and\r\napplicable to the force as a whole. Any tasks or instructions\r\napplicable to individual task forces, only, will have been included in\r\nthe appropriate earlier subparagraph(s) (i.e., 3 (a), (b), (c), etc.).\r\nTo avoid repetition in these subparagraphs, coordinating instructions\r\napplying to more than one task force may also be included, when\r\nconvenient to do so, in paragraph 3 (x).\r\n\r\nParagraph 3 (x) of Operation Plans and Battle Plans prescribes, in\r\naddition to other applicable matters, the time and/or manner of\r\nplacing the plan in effect.\r\n\r\nParagraph 4 is the logistics paragraph. It sets forth the availability\r\nof services and supplies, and describes and gives effect to the\r\ngeneral plan for the logistics support of the operation. If the\r\ninformation and instructions as to logistics are long and detailed,\r\nthey may be embodied in a separate logistics plan, which is referred\r\nto in paragraph 4, and is attached as an annex.\r\n\r\nParagraph 4 is not used for assigning tasks as to movement, either for\r\nthe Train or for any other subdivision of the force.\r\n\r\nParagraph 5 is the command paragraph. It contains instructions\r\nconsidered necessary for the control of the command during the\r\noperation, such as the plan of communications, zone time to be used,\r\nrendezvous, and location of the commander. Paragraph 5 completes the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe Ending consists of the signature, the list of annexes, the\r\ndistribution, and the authentication, as noted below:\r\n\r\n    The Signature of the commander issuing the directive, with his\r\n    rank and command title, is placed at the end, for example:\r\n    John Doe, Vice Admiral, Commander Northern Scouts.\r\n\r\n    Annexes consist of amplifying instructions which are so\r\n    extensive as to make them undesirable for inclusion in the\r\n    directive itself. They contain detailed instructions, in\r\n    written form or in the form of charts or sketches. Separate\r\n    Communications, Logistics, Sortie, Movement, Cruising,\r\n    Intelligence, Scouting, Screening, Approach and Deployment\r\n    Plans may be, and frequently are, disseminated as annexes to a\r\n    directive. Alternative Plans may also be annexed.\r\n\r\n    Annexes are referred to in the appropriate paragraph of the\r\n    body of the directive, and are listed and serially lettered in\r\n    capitals at the end near the left-hand margin, immediately\r\n    below the body and the signature, and above the distribution.\r\n\r\n    The Distribution indicates to whom the directive will be\r\n    transmitted and the medium of transmission. The recording of\r\n    this distribution in the directive is essential for the\r\n    information of all concerned.\r\n\r\n    Standard distribution may be indicated, as Distribution I, II,\r\n    etc.\r\n\r\n    Authentication. Unless signed by the issuing officer, each\r\n    copy of the directive distributed is authenticated by the\r\n    signature, rank, and designation of the Flag Secretary, with\r\n    the addition of the seal whenever possible.\r\n\r\nCampaign Plans. Campaign Plans (see page 196), when communicated to\r\nofficers on the highest echelons, are usually, in the Order Form,\r\nmodified as follows:\r\n\r\nHeading. No change.\r\n\r\nTask Organization. Not usually used.\r\n\r\n    Paragraph 1. In addition to the information to be furnished,\r\n        a statement is given of the assumptions (page 155)\r\n        forming the basis of the plan.\r\n\r\n    Paragraph 2. No change.\r\n\r\n    Paragraph 3. This shows the stages into which the campaign has\r\n        been divided; the several operations which will be\r\n        undertaken in each stage, and the order of their\r\n        accomplishment; and usually the forces to be made\r\n        available for the first stage.\r\n\r\n    Paragraph 4. No change.\r\n\r\n    Paragraph 5. No change.\r\n\r\nIf it be found desirable, however, to employ a letter of instructions\r\ninstead of a formal directive, this may be done. In this case the\r\nletter sets forth the essential features of the subject matter as\r\nabove described for the Order Form.\r\n\r\nSample Outline Form. For convenient reference, the outline form of an\r\nOperation Plan is appended (see page 219). The Operation Order follows\r\nthe same form, the essential difference being that the Operation Order\r\nmakes no provision for assumptions, and is effective upon receipt\r\nunless otherwise provided in the body of the Order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypes of Naval Directives\r\n\r\nNaval directives in common use are: War Plans, Campaign Plans,\r\nOperation Plans, Operation Orders, Battle Plans, and Battle Orders.\r\n\r\nBasic War Plans designate operating forces, assign broad strategical\r\ntasks to these forces, and, where required, delimit theaters of\r\noperations. These plans also assign duties to the supporting services\r\nsuch as naval communications, etc. Requirements as to logistics plans\r\nare also included. Accepted usage designates, as Contributory Plans,\r\nthe subsidiary plans which are prepared in support of Basic War Plans.\r\n\r\nCampaign Plans. A campaign, as initially visualized, is a clearly\r\ndefined major stage of a war. A campaign, after it has passed into\r\nhistory, sometimes bears the name of a leader, or a seasonal or\r\ngeographical designation. It may consist of a single operation, or of\r\nsuccessive or concurrent operations. The operations of a campaign have\r\nproperly a definite objective, the attainment or abandonment of which\r\nmarks the end of the campaign. (See also page 37, as to operations.)\r\n\r\nA Campaign Plan indicates what might be called the \"schedule of\r\nstrategy\" which the commander intends to employ to attain his ultimate\r\nobjective for the campaign. Such a plan usually sets forth the stages\r\ninto which he proposes to divide the campaign, shows their sequence,\r\nand outlines:\r\n\r\n(a) The general plan for the entire campaign.\r\n\r\n(b) The general plan involved in each stage and the order of\r\naccomplishment, so far as the commander has been able to project his\r\naction into the future, and usually,\r\n\r\n(c) The forces to be made available for the first stage. The Campaign\r\nPlan is primarily for the guidance of the commander himself. When\r\nnecessary for information or approval, it is forwarded to higher\r\nauthority. To provide the necessary background, it may sometimes be\r\nfurnished to the principal subordinates. In any case, the interests of\r\nsecrecy demand that its distribution be extremely limited.\r\n\r\nOperation Plans. An Operation Plan may cover projected operations, or\r\nmay be contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event, or\r\ncombination of events. It may be issued in advance of the event. It is\r\nplaced in effect at a specified time or by special order, as\r\nprescribed in the body of the plan itself. It provides for either a\r\nsingle operation, or for a connected series of operations to be\r\ncarried out simultaneously or in successive steps. It is prepared for\r\ndissemination to task-force commanders.\r\n\r\nUsually, an Operation Plan covers more complex operations than does an\r\nOperation Order, and projects operations over a greater time and\r\nspace. It allows more latitude to subordinate commanders, and provides\r\nfor less direct supervision by the issuing officer. It has typically\r\nthe distinguishing feature of including, in paragraph 1, the\r\nassumptions upon which the plan is based.\r\n\r\nTo provide for eventualities under varying sets of assumptions, the\r\ncommander may formulate several alternative Operation Plans (see pages\r\n155 and 156).\r\n\r\nOperation Orders. An Operation Order deals with an actual situation,\r\nusually of limited scope, in which the commander considers that he\r\npossesses sufficient reliable information to warrant an expectation\r\nthat certain specific operations can be initiated and carried through\r\nto completion as ordered. The Operation Order does not include\r\nassumptions and, unless it contains a proviso to the contrary, is\r\neffective upon receipt.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions obtaining in modern warfare, there are few\r\noccasions where the Operation Plan will not accomplish the full\r\npurpose of the Operation Order. The use of the Operation Plan removes\r\nthe undesirable feature of imposing possible restriction on the\r\nlatitude allowed the subordinate without, in any degree, lessening the\r\nauthority of the commander.\r\n\r\nBattle Plans. A Battle Plan sets forth methods for the coordinated\r\nemployment of forces during battle. If prepared in advance, it usually\r\nis based on certain assumptions which are clearly stated in the plan.\r\n\r\nBattle Plans may merely include provisions for a particular combat, or\r\nthey may include provisions for a connected series of separate or\r\ncoordinate engagements, possibly culminating in a general action, and\r\nall directed toward the early attainment of a specified tactical\r\nobjective. Such combats may range in scope from engagements between\r\nsmall forces to engagements between entire fleets.\r\n\r\nBattle Orders are generally limited to the despatches required to\r\nplace a Battle Plan in effect, and to direct such changes in plan, or\r\nto initiate such detailed operations, as may be necessary during the\r\nprogress of battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SUPERVISION OF THE PLANNED ACTION\r\n\r\n(The Fourth Step)\r\n\r\n    The discussion in Chapter IX invites attention to the special\r\n    considerations which influence the supervision of the planned\r\n    action. The Running Estimate, which employs the procedure\r\n    typical of the fourth step, is described in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature of Discussion. As explained previously (Foreword, page 4), the\r\nvast and important subject of the execution of the plan is treated\r\nherein, as to details, chiefly from the standpoint of the mental\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nAfter the commander has issued a directive placing a plan in effect,\r\nit is his responsibility to supervise the execution of the planned\r\naction. Through the collection, analysis, evaluation, and\r\ninterpretation of new information (page 161), he will be able to\r\nmaintain a grasp of present progress and of future possibilities. He\r\nwill correct deficiencies and errors in the plan and in its execution.\r\nHe will guide the direction of effort toward the attainment of the\r\nobjective. He will ensure that his forces conform their movement in\r\ncorrect relation to the physical objectives and to each other. He will\r\nreapportion strength to meet new conditions, through comparison of his\r\naccrued losses with respect to those he has anticipated. He will take\r\nappropriate measures for freedom of action.\r\n\r\nIf a new plan is needed, the commander will evolve one and adopt it.\r\nIf the old plan requires changes as to its larger aspects, he will\r\nmake such changes. Otherwise, he will modify details of his plan as\r\nthe situation may demand, always, however, endeavoring to retain the\r\nintegrity of the larger aspects. He will issue additional directives\r\nas may be required from time to time.\r\n\r\nGoal of Planning. The function of planning (Part II, preceding) is to\r\nafford a proper basis for effective execution. Effective action,\r\ntherefore, is the goal of planning.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, planning is aimless, except as a mental exercise. Such\r\nmental exercise, though it be with no thought of specific application\r\nin the realm of action, has nevertheless the same fundamental aim as\r\nif the planning were so intended. The aim of such mental exercise is\r\nthe inculcation of habits of thought which will provide a sound basis\r\nfor effective action.\r\n\r\nImportance of Execution. Sound planning is, as explained in previous\r\nchapters, the best basis for consistently effective action. Yet,\r\nimportant as planning is, the effective outcome of plans depends upon\r\ntheir execution.\r\n\r\nWhile an unsound plan affords no firm basis for successful action,\r\nrecognition has long been accorded to the companion fact that a\r\nperfect plan, poorly executed, may not provide as firm a foundation\r\nfor success as a reasonably good plan, carried out with resolution.\r\n\r\nNo plan, moreover, can be confidently expected to anticipate all\r\neventualities. Notwithstanding every effort to foresee all\r\npossibilities, unexpected changes are to be regarded as normal. This\r\nfact emphasizes the importance of effective supervision of the planned\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe importance of such supervision reaches its maximum during actual\r\nhostilities; then (page 4) the necessity for alert supervision creates\r\nan accentuated demand for the intelligent application of mental power\r\nto the solution of military problems. Professional judgment then\r\nassumes supreme importance because vital issues may hinge upon the\r\ndecisions reached during the development of the action.\r\n\r\nConditions in War. Standards of performance in peacetime exercises\r\ncannot be a conclusive guide as to what may be expected under the\r\nconditions of war. In the conduct of hostilities against a strong and\r\ndetermined enemy, men and materiel do not always function at their\r\nbest. Commanders undergo extreme strains. Orders are often\r\nmisinterpreted or go astray. Men, and the machines which they operate,\r\nfrequently give less effective service than under the conditions of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn war, mistakes are normal; errors are usual; information is seldom\r\ncomplete, often inaccurate, and frequently misleading. Success is won,\r\nnot by personnel and materiel in prime condition, but by the debris of\r\nan organization worn by the strain of campaign and shaken by the shock\r\nof battle. The objective is attained, in war, under conditions which\r\noften impose extreme disadvantages. It is in the light of these facts\r\nthat the commander expects to shape his course during the supervision\r\nof the planned action.\r\n\r\nThe Incentive. During the supervision of the action, problems calling\r\nfor decision may derive their incentive, as already noted (page 79)\r\neither from a directive issued by superior authority, or by reason of\r\na Decision which the commander himself has already made, or because of\r\na recognition, by the commander concerned, of an incentive\r\noriginating from the demands of the situation.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the incentive appears in the form of a new task\r\nassigned by a higher echelon, the commander's problem may become,\r\nrelatively, simple. In such a case he is relieved of the necessity of\r\nrecognizing for himself that the time is ripe for a new decision. This\r\nfact, however, in no wise alters his fundamental responsibility for\r\ntaking action, or for abstaining therefrom, in accordance with the\r\nactual demands of the situation (page 15) in the event that the\r\nassigned task requires modification or alteration, or, further, in the\r\nevent that circumstances even call for a departure from his\r\ninstructions. Should modification, alteration, or departure be in\r\norder, the commander is responsible for recognition of the fact that\r\nthe demands of the situation have introduced further problems.\r\n\r\nSuch recognition, therefore, irrespective of whether higher authority\r\nhas issued instructions covering the new situation, constitutes an\r\nincentive to take action. No commander is justified in taking wrong\r\naction, or in taking none, merely because no instructions have been\r\nreceived. The ability to recognize the fact that the situation\r\npresents a new problem is therefore a primary qualification for\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nRecognition of New Problems. The supervision of the planned action, as\r\nthe fourth step (see Chapter V) of the exercise of mental effort in\r\nthe solution of military problems, therefore constitutes in itself a\r\nproblem, in that it involves fundamentally the ability to recognize\r\nthe existence of new situations which present new problems for\r\nsolution. To recognize such new problems requires a constant, close\r\nobservation of the unfolding of the original situation.\r\n\r\nOnly an alert commander can invariably determine whether the situation\r\nis unfolding along the lines which he desires and as promulgated in\r\nthe directives formulated in the third step (see Chapter V and Chapter\r\nVIII). In effect, the commander, after action has begun, considers the\r\nchanging situation as a variable in the problem presented by the\r\noriginal situation. With the march of events he is, therefore,\r\nconstantly critical to detect whether variations in the original\r\nsituation are in accordance with his design or whether these\r\nvariations demand a departure from his plan.\r\n\r\nNature of Readjustments Required. If variations in the original\r\nsituation are in accordance with his design, the commander has the\r\nassurance that all goes well, and that the unfolding of the situation\r\nis following his intent. However, if this is not the case, changed\r\ncircumstances may demand recognition of the fact that a new problem\r\nhas presented itself. In this event a new incentive, arising from the\r\ndemands of the situation, calls for the solution of the new problem by\r\nthe procedure distinctive of the first step (Chapter VI).\r\n\r\nShould directives of higher authority introduce a new incentive, the\r\ncommander solves such a new problem, also, by employing the procedure\r\ndistinctive of the first step.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the commander may find that the changed situation\r\nmotivates merely a modification of his previously determined\r\noperations and of his directives already in force. In other words,\r\nwhile his basic problem (Chapters V and VI) may remain the same, need\r\nmay arise for certain deviations from the decisions arrived at in the\r\nfirst and second steps of its solution. Should this be the case, each\r\nsuch problem will require solution by a return to the procedures\r\ndescribed (Chapter VII) with reference to the second step.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a demonstrated need, not for any change of plan, but\r\nfor a clarification of directives, the procedure involved is that\r\ndistinctive of the third step (Chapter VIII).\r\n\r\nThe commander may not safely view the succession of events with\r\ncomplacency, even though the situation appears to be unfolding\r\naccording to plan. Perhaps the enemy may be purposely lessening his\r\nopposition, in order to prepare for the launching of an offensive\r\nelsewhere. As the situation unfolds, everything is viewed with\r\nintelligent suspicion.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that, during the progress of an operation, an\r\nunforeseen opportunity may present itself to take advantage of a new\r\nsituation and to strike the enemy a more serious blow than that\r\noriginally intended.\r\n\r\nUnwise caution is to be avoided no less than undue temerity. Where a\r\nchange appears, after proper consideration, to be indicated, no\r\nhesitancy is justified in abandoning the original plan. Blind\r\nadherence to plan is to be condemned no less than unwarranted\r\ndepartures from predetermined procedure. Obstinate insistence on the\r\nuse of a certain method, to the exclusion of others calculated to\r\nattain the same effect, may jeopardize the success of the effort.\r\nUndue emphasis on the particular means to be used, and on the manner\r\nof their employment, may exact a penalty by obscuring the objective.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, undesirable departures from plan involve a\r\ncorresponding penalty, because changes, unless duly justified by the\r\nsituation, increase the possibility of failure. Frequency of such\r\nchanges, to the point of vacillation, is a sure indication of a lack\r\nof aptitude for the exercise of command.\r\n\r\nImportance of the Will of the Commander. It is accordingly clear that\r\nqualification for the exercise of command requires the mental capacity\r\nto recognize the need for changes in plan, or for no change. No less\r\nessential, however, are the moral qualities required to carry\r\njustified changes into effect, or to resist the pressure of events in\r\nfavor of changes not justified by the situation. (See also pages 8, 9,\r\nand 72.)\r\n\r\nHence the universal importance accorded, by the profession of arms, to\r\nthe will of the commander. This is the quality which, together with\r\nthe mental ability to understand what is needed, enables the commander\r\nto bend events in conformity with his plan (page 47), or, where such\r\nshaping of circumstances is infeasible, to ensure for his command\r\nevery possible advantage which can be obtained.\r\n\r\nA recognized defect of certain forms of theoretical problems lies in\r\nthe fact that they indicate, themselves, the time when a Decision is\r\nneeded. In other words, they fail to vest the commander with\r\nresponsibility for the decision that the time has come for a Decision\r\nto be made. Hence the great importance, from the viewpoint of timing,\r\nof those problems and exercises which partake more fully of the\r\nreality of war. The successful conduct of war, notwithstanding its\r\ndemand for utmost mental power, is founded predominantly on those\r\nmoral qualities (see pages 9 and 72) which spring less from the\r\nintellect than from the will.\r\n\r\n\r\nProblems Involving Modifications of the Basic Plan\r\n\r\nRelatively minor deviations from decisions reached during the first\r\nand second steps of the solution of a military problem are frequently\r\nrequired during the action phase, because of incentives arising from\r\nthe demands of the situation. Such requirements will not occasion\r\nserious dislocation in the predetermined effort of the competent\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nHowever, more momentous situations are also to be expected. These will\r\npresent new problems for the commander to solve. Such new problems, so\r\nlong as they do not challenge the integrity of the basic plan, will\r\nnot prevent the competent commander from proceeding with his\r\npredetermined effort if he takes appropriate action in due time to\r\ncontrol the unfolding situation. To maintain such control may call for\r\nthe exercise of outstanding qualities of the mind and of the will.\r\n\r\nFor example, it is assumed that the commander's basic Decision was to\r\ndestroy an enemy convoy, the purpose of the Decision being to prevent\r\nthe convoy from reaching its destination. Now, it is supposed that,\r\nduring the supervision of the action planned for the destruction of\r\nthe enemy convoy, the commander receives information of a hostile\r\nreinforcement. It is further supposed that this reinforcement, if it\r\njoins the enemy convoy's escort, can jeopardize the success of the\r\nbasic plan.\r\n\r\nThe commander is now confronted with a serious situation which, if not\r\ncontrolled by action of the right kind, at the right time, and at the\r\nright place, may result in shattering his basic plan. However, if the\r\ncommander takes action along correct lines in due time, he can still\r\npreserve the integrity of his basic plan and so continue to control\r\nthe shaping of the situation.\r\n\r\nHaving re-examined his solution of his basic problem and found it\r\nsound, the commander finds himself under the necessity of resolving a\r\nperplexity as to what to do about the enemy reinforcement. In this\r\ncase, he concludes that his proper action is to prevent the enemy\r\nreinforcement from protecting the convoy. This task, self-assigned\r\nbecause of the demands of the situation, becomes the basis for the\r\nmission of his new problem, the mission being:--\r\n\r\n    (Task) To prevent the enemy reinforcements from protecting the\r\n    convoy,\r\n\r\n    (Purpose) in order to contribute to the eventual destruction\r\n    of the convoy.\r\n\r\nThe commander now considers the various courses of action open to him\r\nfor the accomplishment of this mission. He also considers the enemy\r\ncourses of action. He then considers each of the former in relation to\r\neach of the latter. He compares, on this basis, each of his retained\r\ncourses of action with the others and so selects the best course of\r\naction. Finally, he arrives, in this manner, by the same process as in\r\na basic problem (Chapter VI), at a decision as to the best course of\r\naction. Should this decision be to sink the enemy reinforcement, its\r\nstatement linked to its purpose, would be:--\r\n\r\n    To destroy the enemy reinforcement, in order to prevent it\r\n    from protecting the convoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nProblems Challenging the Integrity of the Basic Plan\r\n\r\nDuring the planned action, a change in the situation may have the\r\neffect of challenging the integrity of the basic plan. The commander\r\nis then faced by a problem calling for the exercise of the highest\r\norder of ability. While problems of this type probably occur with\r\nleast frequency, they are the most important of those which may be\r\nencountered during the fourth step.\r\n\r\nBecause such a problem, arising from the demands of a new situation,\r\nrequires a re-estimate of the basic situation, the essential procedure\r\nis the same as for a basic problem (Chapter VI), but certain\r\nmodifications necessarily appear.\r\n\r\nSummary of the Situation. While a commander will rarely find himself\r\noperating without instructions, the importance of problems arising\r\nwhen no directive applies is not lessened by the fact that such\r\nproblems may infrequently occur. When the commander is faced with a\r\nsituation not covered in orders of his superior, action may be\r\nnecessary before he can inform higher authority and receive\r\ninstructions. Usually this situation will be an emergency. Often it\r\nwill not allow time for a written estimate. The fact that such a\r\nsituation has arisen, and the reasons causing the commander to\r\nconclude that it has arisen, are appropriately included in Section I-A\r\nof the Estimate, under the \"Summary of the Situation\".\r\n\r\nRecognition of the Incentive. The conclusion on the part of the\r\ncommander that the situation requires him to make provision for its\r\nmaintenance, or for a change, which in either case calls for a\r\ndeparture from his basic Decision, constitutes a recognition of his\r\nnew incentive.\r\n\r\nAppreciation of the Objective. Frequently the new incentive will\r\nindicate that the objective embodied in the commander's present task\r\nis no longer suitable, but that the purpose of his mission still\r\napplies. By modifying the objective indicated in his assigned task,\r\nbut adhering to that in the purpose of his mission, he may be able to\r\nvisualize a new objective which will be appropriate to the new\r\ncircumstances. In this case the retained purpose assists the commander\r\nto select a new objective which he can confidently adopt as the basis\r\nfor a new task which he assigns to himself.\r\n\r\nIf neither the commander's task nor the purpose of his mission apply\r\nin the new situation, the evolution of a proper new objective may be\r\nmuch more difficult. Under such circumstances the commander, by the\r\nuse of such information as may be in his possession, will first\r\nendeavor to deduce an objective whose attainment constitutes a\r\nsuitable purpose. Such a deduction will be made on the basis of the\r\nlarger circumstances of the war, the campaign, or the operation.\r\nHaving made this determination, the commander will then deduce a task\r\nappropriate to the new situation and in furtherance of the adopted\r\npurpose. (See Chapter IV, page 52.)\r\n\r\nFormulation of the New Mission. An appropriate new task having been\r\ndetermined, as well as a proper purpose, the commander is now in a\r\nposition to formulate his mission. The procedure to this end is the\r\nsame as described (Chapter VI) with respect to the estimate of a basic\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nOther Items of the Estimate. For such problems of the fourth step,\r\nother items of the Estimate Form require no essential modification of\r\nthe procedures described (Chapter VI) as applicable for the first\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Further Procedure Applicable to Such Problems of The Fourth Step\r\n\r\nAfter the commander has reached his new decision, the further course\r\nof events may call for the resolution of the required new action into\r\ndetailed operations and for the inauguration of a new planned effort.\r\nIn such case, these procedures are accomplished through processes\r\nessentially similar to, and fortified by the experience gained in,\r\nthose distinctive of the second and third steps. (Chapters VII and\r\nVIII, respectively).\r\n\r\nThe new planned effort having been inaugurated, its supervision\r\ncontinues, in turn, through the critical observation and the\r\nappropriate action described herein as distinctive of the fourth step.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Running Estimate of the Situation\r\n\r\nThe procedure employed in the constant, close observation of the\r\nunfolding of the situation--to the end that justified changes of plan\r\nmay be initiated, while those uncalled-for may be avoided--is known as\r\nthe \"Running Estimate of the Situation\". Such an estimate, as\r\nindicated by its name, is intended to keep pace with the flow of\r\nevents, so that the commander may be assured, at any time, that his\r\nconcurrent action will be based on sound decision. To this end, there\r\nis a definite technique for which the standard Estimate Form provides\r\nthe basis. This technique is an aid for solution of the problem\r\ninvolved in the supervision of the planned action.\r\n\r\nAim of the Technique Involved. Any procedure adopted to this end is\r\nproperly intended to assist in the supervision of the planned action,\r\nbut not to restrict the commander to particular methods. Flexibility\r\nis a prime consideration. The ultimate aim of the technique is (see\r\nalso page 114) the rapid and successful exercise of mental effort in\r\nthe fast-moving events of the tactical engagement. It is under such\r\nconditions, more especially, that effective supervision of the planned\r\naction becomes a problem calling for every facility that can be\r\nafforded the commander.\r\n\r\nNature of the Technique. The solution of this problem requires\r\nmentally or in writing according to the particular case, (a) the\r\nassembly of information as to events bearing on the situation, and (b)\r\nthe organization of this knowledge in a manner permitting its ready\r\nuse. Accordingly, it will be found helpful, where circumstances permit\r\nwritten records to be kept, to provide for (a) a journal (a form of\r\ndiary) of events, with a file to support it, and (b) a work sheet to\r\norganize applicable information in proper form for use. The journal\r\naffords a basis for the work sheet. The latter in turn facilitates the\r\nprocedure, continuous while the action lasts, of estimating the\r\nsituation so that a Decision maybe rendered at any time desired.\r\n\r\nWhere written records are unnecessary or impracticable, the same\r\nfundamental process is nevertheless employed. The fact that the\r\nprocess is then wholly mental, without extraneous aids, involves no\r\nchange in the basic character of the essential procedure.\r\n\r\nJournal. The journal, to serve the purpose indicated above, is kept in\r\na form permitting entry of essential data as to information needed for\r\nthe Running Estimate. Such data may include (see the suggested Form,\r\nnext page) the appropriate heading of the journal, the entries\r\napplicable to each item of pertinent information, and the\r\nauthentication with which the journal, for any chosen period, is\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURNAL\r\n\r\n(Organization, staff subdivision, etc.)\r\n\r\nFrom: .................................................\r\n                          (date and hour)\r\n\r\nTo: ...................................................\r\n                          (date and hour)\r\n\r\nPlace: ................................................\r\n\r\n\r\n----+-----+------+-------+------+--------+--------------------+-------\r\nTOR | TOD | Time | Serial| From |  To    |Incidents, Messages,|Action\r\n    |     | Dated|  No.  |      |(Action)|   Orders, etc.     |Taken\r\n----+-----+------+-------+------+--------+--------------------+-------\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n    |     |      |       |      |        |                    |\r\n----+-----+------+-------+------+--------+--------------------+-------\r\n\r\nThe heading of the journal is completed by inserting the designation\r\nof the organization and, where appropriate, the staff subdivision\r\nconcerned, as well as the date and hour of beginning and closing the\r\njournal, and the place (or general area) where the commander is\r\nlocated.\r\n\r\nEach entry includes, where appropriate, a time notation: for example,\r\nas to the occurrence of an incident; the receipt (TOR) or despatch\r\n(TOD) of a message; the receipt or issue of an order. The serial\r\nnumber assigned to the entry is recorded. The \"time dated\" is the date\r\nand hour of the incident, or, in the case of the message or order, the\r\ndate and hour appearing thereon.\r\n\r\nEntry of the nature of incidents or of the content of messages and\r\norders, etc., is made under the heading \"Incidents, Messages, Orders,\r\netc.\"; for example:\r\n\r\n    As to an incident:\r\n\r\n      Enemy bombed light forces in screen from northward.\r\n\r\nAs to a message:\r\n\r\n      Our troops held up on Beach A since 0500 this date.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a message or order, the source and the action\r\naddressee(s) are recorded in the columns marked \"From\" and \"To\r\n(action)\" respectively. The content of the despatch or order then\r\nfollows. The amount of detail to be included depends upon the needs of\r\nthe work sheet (see below) in its capacity as a basis for the running\r\nestimate of the situation. Further details can be ascertained, if\r\nneeded, by reference to the journal file.\r\n\r\nThe action taken (\"None\" entered, if none is taken) is indicated\r\nbriefly under that heading. In the case of the above entry as to the\r\nenemy bombing light forces, the \"action taken\" might, for example\r\nread:\r\n\r\n    Prepared for torpedo attack.\r\n\r\nA single journal may be maintained for the commander concerned; or, if\r\nso desired, separate journals may be kept, for their respective\r\npurposes, by the several principal officers of his staff.\r\n\r\nThe journal itself and its use are readily adaptable to informal\r\nmethods of preparation and maintenance. The Journal Form may be\r\nprepared hastily, as needed or desired. Where appropriate, the Journal\r\nForm may be made up in quantity by printing, multigraphing, or other\r\npracticable methods.\r\n\r\nJournal File. The file to support the journal is merely an assembly of\r\nthe records (messages, records of oral orders, and the like) from\r\nwhich the journal is compiled. Each item of the file bears a serial\r\nnumber corresponding to that of its entry in the journal. An ordinary\r\nspike-file is frequently adequate for safe-keeping of these records\r\nwhile in use. When the journal is closed, the corresponding\r\njournal-file is filed with the journal, in accordance with standing\r\ninstructions or in compliance with any particular disposition directed\r\nby the commander concerned or by higher authority.\r\n\r\nWork Sheet. The usual form of the work sheet follows the form of the\r\nestimate of the situation. A single work sheet may be kept for the\r\ncommander concerned, or, if so desired, separate work sheets may be\r\nmaintained, for their respective purposes, by the several principal\r\nsubdivisions of his staff. If a single work sheet is maintained,\r\nentries by the several staff subdivisions may be facilitated by\r\ndividing the work sheet among them, provided that the entire document\r\ncan always be promptly assembled for use as needed.\r\n\r\nThe work sheet, while an important official document, is ordinarily\r\ninformal in nature. The various headings, items, or titles (other than\r\nthe main heading) are merely copied, ordinarily, from the usual\r\nEstimate Form. An example of a work sheet is as follows (see next\r\npage):\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK SHEET\r\n(For Running Estimate of the Situation)\r\n\r\n    ........................................\r\n    (Organization, staff subdivision, etc.)\r\n\r\n    From: ..................................\r\n               (Date and hour)\r\n\r\n    To: ....................................\r\n           (Date and hour, if pertinent)\r\n\r\n    Place: .................................\r\n\r\nI.

(Note: This and subsequent headings are entered in the manner\r\n     indicated as to Section I-A, above.)\r\n\r\nThe remaining necessary headings and subheadings of the Estimate Form\r\nwould be entered similarly, in due order, on succeeding pages.\r\n\r\nThe use of a voluminous work-sheet is facilitated by entering item\r\nheadings in a narrow column at the left, and by cutting away unused\r\nspace below the several headings in such column, so that all the\r\nheadings (or the more important ones) can be seen at a glance. A\r\nperson using the work-sheet can then readily find any page desired.\r\n\r\nThe main heading (top, first page) is filled out in the same manner as\r\nfor the journal.\r\n\r\nThe other headings, for subdivisions of the work sheet, are ordinarily\r\ntranscribed from the usual Estimate Form, according to the needs for\r\nthe purpose of the particular work sheet. Such needs will vary with\r\ncircumstances. As has also been noted, the Estimate Form, itself\r\n(Chapter VI), varies with the situation. For these reasons, the\r\nwork-sheet form is necessarily flexible, and will rarely be prescribed\r\nin detail. Reproduction by printing, etc., will not be so frequent as\r\nin the case of more rigid forms. The work sheet is authenticated only\r\nif it is filed (see below), or if authentication is desired for other\r\nreasons. The work sheet is, in fact, as indicated by its name, merely\r\na vehicle to facilitate the performance of important mental work.\r\n\r\nWhen the work sheet has served its purpose, it is usually destroyed.\r\nIt is not, ordinarily, a permanent record, since such purpose is\r\nserved by the journal and its file. When a formal Estimate is made up\r\nfrom the work sheet, such Estimate may serve the purpose of an\r\nadditional record. If no formal Estimate is made up for a given period\r\nand the commander desires the corresponding work sheet to be preserved\r\nfor record, he may so direct.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the work sheet is not destroyed or filed (and a new one\r\nstarted) at any specified time. The work sheet is kept current by\r\nmarking out old entries no longer applicable; by inserting new\r\nentries; and by inserting fresh pages when old ones have been filled.\r\nThe old pages, unless otherwise desired, may be destroyed.\r\n\r\nA separate page of the work sheet is ordinarily used for each item\r\nunder which entries are to be made. This procedure applies not only to\r\nprincipal headings, but also to subordinate titles, according to the\r\nconvenience of the user.\r\n\r\nThe procedure of devoting a separate page, initially, to each item of\r\nthe form enables additional pages to be inserted, where needed.\r\nManifestly, the amount of space needed for particular items of the\r\nform cannot always be foreseen. The entries, for example, under the\r\n\"Summary of the Situation\", in Section I-A of the Estimate Form, may\r\nrequire little space or a great deal, depending upon the occurrence of\r\nevents and upon the period of time covered by the particular work\r\nsheet. The same considerations are applicable as to other items.\r\n\r\nWhen a work sheet is used as the basis for rendering special reports\r\n(e.g., as to intelligence or operations), its form follows that used\r\nfor such reports. It is, therefore, in essence, merely an\r\noutline-form, for entry of applicable data.\r\n\r\nProcedure as to Entries. When a report, a plan, a dispatch, or other\r\npertinent item is received, its applicable content may first be\r\nentered on the chart (or charts) maintained by the commander (or by\r\nhis staff). Thereafter the usual procedure would be an entry in the\r\njournal, followed by a corresponding entry in the work sheet. The\r\ndocument so received and recorded would then be placed in the journal\r\nfile. This procedure is subject to proper variation, as desired.\r\nImmediate entry of data on the chart enables the commander and staff\r\nto study the implications of the item, without waiting for completion\r\nof routine clerical work.\r\n\r\nOutgoing messages, instructions, etc., after approval or signature by\r\nthe commander, are handled by a similar routine. Where applicable,\r\nsuch routine involves appropriate entry on the chart, in the journal,\r\nand in the work sheet. The routine of entry is preferably based on a\r\ncopy (or copies), in order to avoid delay in dispatch.\r\n\r\nStaff Organization and Functioning. The commander may desire important\r\ndocuments to be handed to him at once, on receipt. He may, of course,\r\ncall for them at any time. He naturally will not, however, permit any\r\nunnecessary delay to occur in the usual routine disposition of such\r\nitems. The routine exists to assist him, and its arbitrary disruption,\r\nif he has properly defined the essential routine in the first\r\ninstance, cannot but work to his disadvantage.\r\n\r\nFew things are more disturbing to the functioning of a staff than\r\nundue eccentricity on the part of the commander or of senior members\r\nof the staff. For instance, a personal habit to be rigorously\r\nsuppressed--a habit not infrequently in evidence, especially under\r\nstrain of active operations--is that of absent-mindedly pocketing\r\ndocuments needed in the work under way. This subject might, but for\r\nlimitations of space, be illustrated by numerous other examples whose\r\nhomely character may not safely be permitted to detract from their\r\nconsidered importance to unity of effort.\r\n\r\nWhere circumstances permit, it is desirable that incoming and outgoing\r\nitems be reproduced in quantity sufficient to supply separate copies\r\nfor the commander and for the several interested members of his staff.\r\n\r\nA competent staff brings to the commander's attention all the items\r\nnecessary--but only those necessary--for his proper performance of his\r\nduties. Inordinate attention by the commander to unnecessary detail\r\ncannot but tend to distract his attention from his proper duties.\r\n\r\nThe importance of smooth and effective functioning of a staff\r\nemphasizes the need for an established, though flexible, procedure.\r\nSuch procedure, if reasonably standardized, facilitates unity of\r\naction, not only within staffs, but also among the several commanders,\r\nand their staffs, throughout the chain of command.\r\n\r\nThe same fundamentals apply as to staff organization. If proper\r\nfunctioning of staffs is generally understood, and if staffs are\r\ncorrectly organized to perform their functions, the basis for their\r\nsound organization will become a matter of general understanding. Such\r\norganization, so understood, becomes a powerful influence in behalf of\r\nunity of effort.\r\n\r\nStaff functions--i.e., characteristic activities of staffs--divide\r\nfundamentally into two classifications. These may be referred to, for\r\nconvenience of terminology, as \"general\" and \"special\".\r\n\r\nThe latter have to do with the characteristic operations of the\r\ncommand, rather than of the commander; they therefore relate to such\r\nmatters as routine administration and to the technical aspects of\r\nmovement, of the use of weapons, and of supply, sanitation, and\r\nhospitalization. The administrative, technical, and supply staff, thus\r\nbroadly considered, may be said to be concerned with special functions\r\nrelating to the operations of the command.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the functions of the commander, as such, have to do with\r\nthe necessary supervision of these special functions and, more\r\nespecially, with the important duty of planning for the future\r\nemployment of the command. The supervisory and planning activities\r\nmay, for purposes of differentiation from the specialties noted above,\r\nbe properly described as general functions. They relate more\r\nparticularly to the duties performed personally by the commander or,\r\nwhere such duties become too onerous for performance by one person, by\r\nspecifically designated members of his staff.\r\n\r\nIn our naval service, the higher commanders are provided, where\r\nappropriate, with a chief of staff, who coordinates and supervises the\r\nwork of the entire staff. Provision is also made, where the nature and\r\namount of the work to be done calls for such assignment, for the\r\ndetail of additional staff officers to perform the important general\r\nfunctions mentioned above. Appropriate provision is also made for\r\nstaff officers to care for the special functions inherent in the\r\ncharacter of the particular command.\r\n\r\nThe important general functions referred to are those relating to\r\nintelligence duties, and to operations. Intelligence duties have to do\r\nwith the collection of information as to the enemy and the theater of\r\noperations, the analysis of this information, its evaluation, its\r\nconversion into intelligence by the process of drawing conclusions,\r\ni.e., by interpretation, and, finally, its dissemination to the\r\ncommand or to other appropriate destinations (page 161). Intelligence\r\nestimates and plans have been discussed previously (Chapters VII and\r\nVIII).\r\n\r\nOperations, in the sense in which the term is employed in this\r\nconnection, relate to the strategical or tactical activities of the\r\ncommand, as distinguished from routine functions pertaining to such\r\nmatters as administration and supply. Operations, therefore, as a term\r\nemployed in contradistinction to intelligence activities, refer more\r\nespecially to the performance of the commander's own force, while\r\nintelligence functions are oriented more particularly with respect to\r\nthe activities of the enemy. Operation plans, which may include\r\nsubsidiary intelligence plans, have been discussed previously\r\n(Chapters VII and VIII).\r\n\r\nFurther details in this connection are touched on hereafter with\r\nrespect to rendition of reports and estimates.\r\n\r\nReports. The work-sheet facilitates the rendition, at any time, of\r\nsuch special reports as may be required by higher authority, or by the\r\ncommander from his staff. The appropriate staff officer is prepared at\r\nall times to render a report, oral or written, informal or formal,\r\nbrief or detailed, of the situation of the command and of other\r\nfriendly forces, or of the situation with reference to the enemy.\r\n\r\nNo less important than rendition of reports to the commander and to\r\nhigher authority is the duty of the staff, or of the commander if he\r\nlacks such staff assistance, to insure that subordinate commands\r\nreceive pertinent information at the proper time. Cooperating friendly\r\nforces will also require such information. This need is sometimes met\r\nby the issue of periodical reports or bulletins. However, during the\r\nintervals between such reports, and at all times when such reports are\r\nlacking, it is a primary duty of the commander and staff to ensure\r\nthat all concerned are informed as to the situation. The work sheet is\r\na valuable aid for the performance of this duty.\r\n\r\nOral Estimates. When called for by higher authority, or by the\r\ncommander from his staff, oral estimates of the situation can be\r\nrendered promptly and effectively by reference to the work sheet.\r\nEstimates called for by the commander are presented by the appropriate\r\nstaff officers. Presentation is made to the commander or, if so\r\ndirected, to the chief of staff, the latter being prepared to render,\r\nin turn, an estimate to the commander. Oral estimates desired by\r\nhigher authority are made by the commander, or by the staff officer\r\nconcerned, at the direction of his commander.\r\n\r\nPartial estimates may be called for from time to time as to particular\r\naspects of the situation.\r\n\r\nIn the larger staffs, the work is facilitated if each principal staff\r\nofficer is prepared to present his appropriate portion of the\r\nestimate. In such case the intelligence officer deals with matters\r\nrelating to the enemy; the operations officer deals with those\r\nrelating to own forces, etc. The entire staff acts as a team in the\r\npresentation of a well-rounded estimate which will bring all pertinent\r\nmatters to the attention of the commander so that he may arrive at a\r\nsound decision.\r\n\r\nShould the commander call also for recommendations as to the decision\r\nor decisions to be made, the appropriate members of the staff will be\r\nprepared to submit their views. They will be prepared, as well, to\r\nanswer at any time the calls of higher authority for information, for\r\nthe conclusions of the commander, or for his recommendations. Should\r\nthe commander have no staff for the performance of the foregoing\r\nfunctions, such detailed duties devolve upon him personally.\r\n\r\nCertain further aspects of estimates of the situation, with reference\r\nto the circumstances obtaining during the supervision of the planned\r\naction, are noted under the discussion of written estimates, which\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nWritten Estimates. The foregoing remarks as to oral estimates are no\r\nless applicable to those submitted in written form, whether formal or\r\ninformal, partial or full, brief or detailed. The nature of an\r\nestimate, as to these characteristics, will largely depend on the time\r\nelement. A long and detailed estimate, often desirable when time is\r\navailable, may be wholly impracticable when the press of events\r\nrequires rapid decision. The written estimate, even if informal,\r\npartial, or brief, would frequently be out of place in situations\r\nwhere an oral estimate would be adequate or, if not adequate, would be\r\nall that could be accomplished under the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Remarks as to Entries\r\n\r\nEntries on Charts. Entries on charts are made by the usual\r\nconventional signs and symbols. Colors are employed where appropriate.\r\nInformation not yet confirmed is indicated as doubtful; e.g., by a\r\nquestion mark. Special remarks, comments, or other notations may also\r\nbe entered, but in such a manner as not to obscure other data on the\r\nchart.\r\n\r\nWhere operations of land forces are involved, maps are prepared by the\r\nmethods prescribed for own land forces. The higher naval staffs, or\r\nthose of forces specially designated for such operations, may include\r\narmy officers who will look after these matters; marine officers may\r\nalso be assigned such duties.\r\n\r\nSpecial charts or maps are those prepared for special purposes. A\r\nchart (or map) maintained to show the existing situation is known as a\r\n\"situation chart\" (or map). Charts (or maps) prepared for particular\r\noperations are known as \"operations charts\" (or maps).\r\n\r\nEntries in Journals. Entries in journals, already referred to, are\r\npurely factual. Such entries may be complete copies of the content of\r\nincoming or outgoing orders or messages. Again, as already indicated\r\n(page 209), entries may consist of condensations of such matters. The\r\noral instructions of the commander are also appropriate items for\r\nentry, when the matter is of sufficient importance. The journal may\r\nalso make note of the movements of the commander, his staff officers,\r\nand other persons. Other pertinent happenings may also be made the\r\nsubject of entry.\r\n\r\nEntries in Work Sheets. Entries in the work sheet, since it is the\r\nbasis for estimates of the situation, are both factual and otherwise.\r\nAll matters entered in the journal are normally appropriate for\r\nnotation in the work sheet. Information not yet confirmed is indicated\r\nas doubtful. The work sheet is also the proper place for notation of\r\nmatters of conjecture (noted as such) and for other like items related\r\nto estimates of the situation. The various considerations influencing\r\nthe commander and staff, with respect to current operations, are\r\nproper entries in the work sheet. Its informal character affords wide\r\nlatitude as to entries which may be considered worthy of record in\r\nthis manner. The underlying consideration is that anything may and\r\nshould be entered which will be of value in preparing estimates or\r\nrendering the special reports for which the work sheet is to provide\r\nthe basis.\r\n\r\nA succinct running account of the situation is kept posted to date\r\nunder the appropriate heading of the work sheet.\r\n\r\nEntry is also made of the incentive which motivates the solution of\r\nthe problem presented by the situation. Notation is made as to whether\r\nthe incentive arises from a task imposed by higher authority or is\r\nderived by the commander from other sources (see page 200). In either\r\ncase, the work sheet is the proper place for the entry of such facts\r\nand of the reasons which have led the commander to regard this\r\nincentive as motivating his actions in the situation existing at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nInformation of the enemy, after receipt from the various collecting\r\nagencies (radio, observers, subordinate forces, etc.), is subject to\r\nthe usual procedures of analysis, evaluation, interpretation, and\r\ndissemination (page 214). Analysis determines the source and the\r\ncircumstances which led to the dispatch of the message. Evaluation\r\ndetermines its degree of reliability. Interpretation calls for drawing\r\nconclusions. The resulting intelligence is then disseminated to those\r\nconcerned, either within the command or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSince information of the enemy does not become intelligence until\r\nconverted thereinto by the process of drawing conclusions, this\r\nimportant procedure is recorded briefly in the work sheet. Such record\r\nmakes available, for inclusion in estimates or in reports, the reasons\r\nwhich have formed the basis for such conclusions.\r\n\r\nInformation of friendly forces, with any deductions drawn therefrom,\r\nis similarly entered in the appropriate portions of the work sheet.\r\n\r\nThe facts and conclusions as to fighting strength of own and enemy\r\nforces are important entries. The summary of fighting strength\r\nincludes proper conclusions as to the relative fighting strength of\r\nthe opposing forces, own and enemy's.\r\n\r\nThe work sheet is also the proper document for other entries pertinent\r\nto estimates of the situation: e.g., the determination of own courses\r\nof action, the examination into enemy capabilities, and the selection\r\nof own best course of action. The commander's decisions, as rendered\r\nfrom time to time, are also entered for purposes of temporary record.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nThe work sheet, therefore, if properly utilized, contains the Running\r\nEstimate of the Situation, and is supported by the journal and the\r\njournal file. By the use of the Running Estimate and its supporting\r\ndocuments, the commander is enabled to keep himself apprised of the\r\ndevelopments of the situation. On this basis he is able to detect the\r\nnecessity for any changes in his plan and to arrive promptly at\r\ndecisions in accordance with such needs. These decisions become the\r\nbasis for new or modified plans and directives, to cause the action of\r\nhis command to conform to changes in the situation.\r\n\r\nWhere the full procedure described in this Chapter is unnecessary or\r\nimpracticable, a suitable modification without fundamental change will\r\nbe found applicable. The mental process, even if no records are kept\r\nin writing, applies to the supervision of the planned action in every\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n    The discussion of \"Sound Military Decision\" now closes with a\r\n    brief review of the application of mental power to the\r\n    solution of military problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental power, which includes the ability to arrive at sound solutions\r\nof military problems, is a recognized essential component of fighting\r\nstrength because (page 18) it is the source of professional judgment.\r\n\r\nThe procedure most likely to ensure sound solutions is the studied\r\nemployment of a natural mental process, differing in no fundamental\r\nrespect from that effectively utilized in all other human activities.\r\nThe basic mental procedure remains unchanged, irrespective of the\r\nnature of the problem,--be it simple or complex, its solution\r\ninstantaneous or slow. The procedure is especially adapted to the\r\nneeds of the profession of arms through the use of the Fundamental\r\nMilitary Principle. By outlining the essential elements involved, this\r\nPrinciple, a valid guide for the solution of military problems, covers\r\nthe full scope of the application of mental power as a recognized\r\ncomponent of fighting strength.\r\n\r\nIt is more especially during the swift-moving action of the tactical\r\nengagement that moral capacity to command, and mental ability to solve\r\nmilitary problems, experience the maximum pressure of events. It is\r\nthen, also, that the responsibility of the commander creates an added\r\ndemand for intelligent application of mental power because of the\r\nvital issues which may hinge upon his decisions. That this pressure be\r\nsuccessfully sustained, and this responsibility effectively\r\ndischarged, is the goal of any system of mental training in the\r\nprofession of arms (page 114).\r\n\r\nOn a fundamental basis of earnest thought, mental ability, character,\r\nknowledge, and experience, finally rests the soundness of decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE FORM OF AN OPERATION PLAN\r\n\r\n                                      TITLES OF THE\r\n                                      SUPERIOR ECHELONS,\r\nFile Notations                        TITLE OF THE FORCE,\r\nSECRET (or CONFIDENTIAL)              NAME OF SHIP, Flagship.\r\n\r\nOperation Plan                        PLACE OF ISSUE,\r\n         No. ----                     Date and hour of issue.\r\n\r\nTASK ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n  (a) Task Force Title, Rank and name of its commander.
