F. Collier & Son, Incorporated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a great thing if we could do away with war!\r\n\r\nBut men are not cast in that mould. We shall continue to have wars; and\r\nsome day the world is going to have a war to which the present will\r\nserve only as a try-out.\r\n\r\nWhen that war comes our country will probably have to bear the burden\r\nfor the western hemisphere. In that war our navy will be our first line\r\nof defense; and what we do for our navy now will have much to do with\r\nwhat our navy will be able to do for us then.\r\n\r\nOur navy to-day is made up of good ships and capable, courageous,\r\nhard-working officers and men. There are some fuddy-duddies and\r\npoliticians among them, but most of them are on the job every minute.\r\nTheir highest hope is the chance to serve their country. The chapters in\r\nthis book which tell of their U-boat hunting only prove once more their\r\ngreat qualities.\r\n\r\nThere are chapters in this book which have nothing to do with U-boat\r\nhunting, but have much to do with the navy. Such are the two opening\r\nchapters and the three closing chapters. The motive of four of those\r\nchapters will probably be obvious; the chapter on the workings of a\r\nsubmarine is included in the hope of interesting our young fellows in\r\nthat type of craft.\r\n\r\nThe need of such a chapter? Take this illustration of what people do not\r\nknow about submarines: Three years ago an admiral on the other side was\r\ncalled into conference on the U-boat problem. When it came his turn to\r\nspeak he said: \"Gentlemen, it is child's talk to say that the U-boats\r\nwill ever amount to anything! Disregard them utterly!\" Only three years\r\nago that was, and that naval officer was considered for commander-in-chief\r\nof the Grand Fleet! Three years ago, and last year the U-boats sank\r\n6,600,000 tons of shipping!\r\n\r\nRight now Germany probably contemplates, or is actually constructing,\r\nU-boats with armor and guns heavy enough to engage on the surface any\r\nwar craft up to the battle-cruiser class. How far from that to fighting\r\nthe heaviest of surface craft--even to the battleships?\r\n\r\nIn the event of invasion--we might as well face that; refusing to think\r\nabout it certainly will not eliminate the possibility,--in the event of\r\ninvasion by a powerful foe our first line of defense will be our navy.\r\nThe navy will always be our first line of defense; and so the need\r\nto-day of interesting in our navy young men,--progressive young men, who\r\nwill learn from the past but prefer to live in the future.\r\n\r\n                                                          J.

We\r\n     were getting near the spot                                     98\r\n\r\n   In the engine-room of a submarine                               242\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVY SHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than one-third of our naval force was being reviewed by the\r\nPresident. A most impressive assembly of men-o'-war it was, in tonnage\r\nand weight of metal the greatest ever floated by the waters of the\r\nwestern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe last of the fleet had arrived on the night before. From the bluffs\r\nalong the shore they might have been seen approaching with a mysterious\r\nplay of lights across the shadowy waters. In the morning they were all\r\nthere. Hardly a type was lacking--the last 16,000-ton double-turreted\r\nbattleship, the protected and heavy-armored cruisers, monitors,\r\ndespatch-boats, gun-boats, destroyers, attendant transport, and supply\r\nships. Fifty ships, 1,200 guns, 16,000 men: all were there, even to the\r\nfascinating little submarines with their round black backs just showing\r\nabove the water.\r\n\r\nIt was that chromatic sort of a morning when the canvas of the\r\nsailing-boats stands out startlingly white against the drizzly sky and\r\nthe smoke from the stacks of the steamers takes on an accented\r\ncoal-black, and, drooping, trails low in a murky wake. Rather a dull\r\nsetting at this early hour; but not sufficiently dull to check the\r\nvivacity of the actors in the scene.\r\n\r\nThe President comes up the side of the _Mayflower_ and, arrived at the\r\nhead of the gangway, stands rigid as any stanchion to attention while\r\nhis colors are shot to the truck and the scarlet-coated band plays the\r\nnational hymn. Then, ascending to the bridge, he takes station by the\r\nstarboard rail with the Secretary of the Navy at his shoulder. The\r\nclouds roll away, the sun comes out, and all is as it should be while he\r\nprepares to review the fleet, which thereafter responds aboundingly to\r\nevery burst of his own inexhaustible enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAnd this fleet, which is lying to anchor in three lines of four miles or\r\nso each in length, with a respectful margin of clear water all about,\r\nis, viewed merely as a marine pageant, magnificent; as a display of\r\npotential fighting power, most convincing. No man might look on it and\r\nhis sensibilities--admiration, patriotism, respect, whatever they might\r\nbe--remain unstirred. To witness it is to pass in mental review the\r\ngreat fleets of other days and inevitably to draw conclusions. Beside\r\nthis armament the ill-destined Armada, Von Tromp's stubborn squadrons,\r\nNelson's walls of oak, or Farragut's steam and sail would dissolve like\r\nthe glucose squadrons that boys buy at Christmas time. Even Dewey's\r\nworkman-like batteries (this to mark the onward rush of naval science)\r\nwould be rated obsolete beside the latest of these!\r\n\r\nIt was first those impressive battleships; and bearing down on them one\r\nbetter saw what terrible war-engines they are. Big guns pointing\r\nforward, big guns pointing astern, long-reaching guns abeam, and little\r\nbusiness-looking machine-guns in the tops--their mere appearance\r\nsuggests their ponderous might. A single broadside from any of these,\r\nproperly placed, and there would be an end to the most renowned\r\nflag-ships of wooden-fleet days. And that this frightful power need\r\nnever wait on wind or tide, nor be hindered in execution by any weather\r\nmuch short of a hurricane, is assured when we note that to-day, while\r\nthe largest of the excursion steamers are heaving to the whitecaps,\r\nthese are lying as immovable almost as sea-walls.\r\n\r\nIt is, first, the flag-ship which thunders out her greeting--one, two,\r\nthree--twenty-one smoke-wreathed guns--while her sailormen, arm to\r\nshoulder, mark in unwavering blue the lines of deck and superstructure.\r\nMeantime the officers on the bridge, admiral in the foreground, are\r\nstanding in salute; and in the intervals of gun-fire there are crashing\r\nout over the waters again the strains of the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" And\r\nthe flag-ship left astern, the guns of the next in line boom out, and on\r\nher also the band plays and men and officers stand to attention; and so\r\nthe next, and next. And, the battleships passed, come the armored\r\ncruisers, riding the waters almost as ponderously as the battleships and\r\nhardly less powerful, but much faster on the trail; and they may run or\r\nfight as they please. After examining them, long and swift-looking, with\r\nno more space between decks than is needed for machinery, stores,\r\narmament, and lung-play for live men, the inevitable reflection recurs\r\nthat the advance of mechanical power must color our dreams of romance in\r\nfuture. Surely the old ways are gone. Imagine one of the old three-deckers\r\naiming to work to windward of one of these in a gale, and if by any\r\nspecial dispensation of Providence she was allowed to win the weather\r\nberth, imagine her trying, while she rolled down to her middle deck, to\r\ndamage one of these belted brutes, who meantime would be leisurely picking\r\nout the particular plank by which she intended to introduce into her\r\nenemy's vitals a weight of explosive metal sufficient in all truth to blow\r\nher out of water.\r\n\r\nAfter the cruisers passed the craft of comparatively small tonnage and\r\npower follow--the gun-boats, transports, and supply ships; and, almost\r\nforgotten, the monitors, riding undisturbedly, like squat little forts\r\nafloat, with freeboard so low that with a slightly undulating sea a\r\nturtle could swim aboard. And after them the destroyers, which look\r\ntheir name. Most wicked inventions; no shining brasswork nor holy-stoned\r\nquarter, no decorative and convenient companionway down the side--no\r\nanything that doesn't make for results. Ugly, wicked-looking, with\r\nhooded ports from under which peer the muzzles of long-barrelled weapons\r\nthat look as if they were designed for the single business of boring,\r\nand boring quickly, holes in steel plate.\r\n\r\nSo the _Mayflower_ steams down the four long lines in review; and always\r\nthe batteries and bands in action, the immortal hymn echoing out like\r\nrolling thunder between the flame-lit broadsides. From shore to shore\r\nthe cannon detonate and our fighting blood is stirred. On the pleasure\r\ncraft skirting the line of pickets like vaguely outlined picture boats\r\nin the dim, perspective haze, the people seem also to be stirred. We\r\ndream of the glory of battle; but better than that, the hymn which has\r\nstirred men to some fine deeds in the past, and shall to just as brave\r\nin the future, mounts like a surging tide to our hearts:\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, say, can you see?\"\r\n\r\nit is asking. And we can see--no need of the glass--ahead, astern,\r\nabeam, aloft, some thousands of them streaming in the fresh west wind,\r\nand within signal distance of their beautiful waving folds a multitude\r\nof men and women in whom the sense of patriotism must have become\r\nimmeasurably deepened for being within call this day.\r\n\r\nThe vibration of brass and pipe, the music and the saluting, one ship\r\nand the next, and never the welcome of one died out before the tumult of\r\nthe next began. It was like the ceaseless roar of the ever-rolling\r\nocean, with never an instant when the ear-drum did not vibrate to the\r\nsalute of cannon, the blood tingle to the call of the nation's hymn. One\r\nfelt faith in ships and crews after it; and later, when in the cabin of\r\nthe _Mayflower_ the admirals and captains gathered, to meet them and to\r\nlisten was to feel anew the assurance that this navy will be ready when\r\nthe hour comes to do whatever may be deemed right and well by the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe admirals and the _attachés_ having departed and dinner become a\r\nthing of the past, it was time to review the electric-light display.\r\n\r\nWe were almost abreast of the first in line, and she was like a ship\r\nfrom fairyland. Along her run the bulbed lights extended, and thence to\r\nher turrets, and, higher up, followed the outline of stacks and tops and\r\nmasts, with floating strings of them suspended here and there between.\r\nMost striking of all, her name in gigantic, flaming letters faced\r\nforward from her bridge. Now one ship decked in a multiplicity of jewels\r\non this clear calm night would have been a beautiful sight--but where\r\nthere were forty-odd of them----!\r\n\r\nIt was a sailor of the fleet, lurking in the shifting shadows of the\r\nbridge, that he might enjoy his surreptitious cigarette and not suffer\r\ndisratement therefor, who reviewed the illuminations most illuminingly.\r\n\"Man, but they do blaze out, don't they? They make me think of the\r\npost-cards we used to buy in foreign ports. You held them up before the\r\nlight and they came out shining like a Christmas-tree. But no ships of\r\ncards these--and that's the wonderful thing, too. Seeing them to-day,\r\nwith their batteries in view, 'twas enough to put the fear o' God in a\r\nman's heart, and now look at them--like a child's dream of heaven--that\r\nis, if we don't sheer too close and see that the guns are still there.\r\nAnd, look now, the tricks they're at!\"\r\n\r\nOutlined in incandescents, the semaphores of a dozen ships were being\r\nworked most industriously. \"Jerk up and down like the legs and arms of\r\nthe mechanical dolls at the theatre, don't they? But these here could be\r\ndancing for something more than the people's amusement if 'twas\r\nnecessary. And what are they saying? Oh, most likely it's 'The\r\ncompliments of the admiral, and will you come aboard the flag-ship and\r\ntry a taste of punch?' And 'With pleasure,' that other one is saying.\r\nAnd they'll be lowering away the launch and no doubt be having a\r\npleasant chat presently. And they could just as easily be saying (if\r\n'twas the right time), 'Pipe to quarters and load with shell'--just as\r\neasy; and they could revolve the near turret of that one, and ten\r\nseconds after they cut loose you and me, if we weren't already killed by\r\nrush of air, would be brushing the salt water from our eyes and clawing\r\naround for a stray piece of wreckage to hang on to. Just as easy--but\r\nlook at 'em now again!\"\r\n\r\nThe search-lights were paralleling and intersecting, now revealing the\r\nperpendicular depths beside the vessel, and now flooding the sky. Twenty\r\nof them, simultaneously flashing, were sweeping the surface of the\r\nSound, one instant outlining the arbored Long Island shore, the next\r\nbetraying the beaches of Connecticut. One, beaming westerly, disclosed a\r\nloaded excursion steamer half-way to Hell Gate, and, a moment later,\r\nturning a hand-spring, picked up in its diverging path the Fall River\r\nsteamer miles away to the eastward.\r\n\r\n\"The torpedo-boats'd have the devil's own time trying to lay aboard\r\nto-night, wouldn't they? And yet if 'twas cloudy 'twould be the\r\nsubmarines! Did you see them to-day? Weren't they cute--like little\r\nwhale pups setting on the water--yes. They say they've got them where\r\nthey turn somersaults now. Great, yes--but terrible, too, when you think\r\nthey're liable to come your way some fine day. Imagine yourself, all at\r\nonce, some night when you ought to be sound asleep in your hammock,\r\nfinding yourself, afore you're yet fair awake, so high in the sky that\r\nyou can almost reach out and take hold of the handle of the Dipper! And\r\nwhen you come down and get the official report, learning that one of\r\nthose cute little playthings had been making a subaqueous call.\r\n\r\n\"It's ninety-odd years since the American navy proved it could do a good\r\njob; for, of course, none of us count Spain, who wasn't ready to begin\r\nwith, and wasn't our size, anyway. And yet, we mightn't make out so bad\r\n'gainst a bigger enemy at that. Our fellows can shoot, that's sure.\r\nThere's a gun crew in this ship we're breasting now, and I saw them\r\nawhile ago put eight 12-inch shot in succession through that regulation\r\nfloating target we use, and it was as far away as the farther end of\r\nthat line of cruisers there, and the target was bobbing up and down, and\r\nwe steaming by at 10 knots an hour. Not too bad--hah? And a hundred\r\ncrews like 'em in the navy. That's for the shooting.\"\r\n\r\nHe flicked the end of another fleeting cigarette over the rail. \"Yes,\r\nthe American navy has fought pretty well, and this navy, no fear, will\r\nfight too. There's more different kinds of people in it than ever\r\nbefore, they say--though as to that I guess there were always more kinds\r\nof people in the navy than the historians ever gave credit for. Now it's\r\nall kinds like the nation itself, I suppose. And that ought to make for\r\ngood fighting, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVY MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing occasion was the first of several naval spectacles staged\r\nby Theodore Roosevelt during his presidency to show the public that we\r\nhad a growing navy, and not too small a navy, and a navy that, ship for\r\nship, need ask for no odds in its equipment at least.\r\n\r\nMore than any President we ever had did Theodore Roosevelt work for a\r\nbig navy. To no President before him in our country did the prospect of\r\na great European war loom so near; a war which meant our participation,\r\nnot so much through any will of our people as by the pressure of\r\nhappenings from the other side.\r\n\r\nHence, the need of the country for as large a navy as we could get\r\ntogether. With an eye for this future need President Roosevelt asked for\r\n4 battleships a year. There were men in Congress who believed that to\r\ntalk of war was foolish; there would be no more war; so, instead of 4,\r\nCongress gave him 2, and the famous \"big stick\" had to come into play\r\nbefore they gave him even the two.\r\n\r\nDuring these years I had the privilege from President Roosevelt of\r\ncruising on United States war-ships--gun-boats, destroyers, cruisers,\r\nbattleships (later, through the good offices of Secretary Daniels, I\r\nbecame acquainted with submarines and navy airplanes).\r\n\r\nThe war-ships were an interesting study, and the life aboard a war-ship\r\nthen was even more interesting, for after all, men, not materials, were\r\nthe chief thing. Almost any fairly well-trained bunch of mechanics will\r\nturn out a pretty good machine to order. But there is no turning out\r\ngood men to order; only good-living generations can do that.\r\n\r\nIf it was a matter of machinery alone, then the Prussian idea would have\r\nthis war already won. But that alone cannot prevail, can never prevail\r\nfor the long run. It is the spirit which must win.\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the navy, officers and men, seemed always so much more\r\ninteresting to me, that for one hour I spent in looking over ship\r\nequipment, I probably spent forty in observing the men; and when you are\r\nlocked up in ships for weeks or months with a lot of men you must, where\r\nyour heart and mind are not closed, come away in time with some sort of\r\nknowledge of them.\r\n\r\nAnd what sort are they?\r\n\r\nWell, they are nearly all young--average age about twenty-one years; and\r\nthey come from anywhere and everywhere--from the farms, the prairies,\r\nthe corners of city streets; and they have been many things--farm-hands,\r\ncarpenters, mechanics, barbers, trolley-car men, clerks, street loafers,\r\ncollege boys. Some are terribly sophisticated in worldly ways and some\r\nso green, of course, that the wags have frequent chances to keep their\r\nwits on edge. Some have come with the plain notion that if a fellow has\r\ngot to fight, why then the navy offers the most comfortable outlook for\r\na fellow--during this war it especially offers it--dry hammock every\r\nnight, no mud, no cooties, and three hot meals at regular intervals--but\r\nmany are there with the bright hope of some day pointing a 14-inch gun\r\nand sending a relay of 1,400-pound shells where they will blow something\r\nforeign and opposing high as the flying clouds.\r\n\r\nBlowing up ships and people may have once seemed a terrible idea, but a\r\nfew weeks in the community of a war-ship with its matter-of-fact,\r\nprofessional manner of discussing such subjects soon brings them around\r\nto common, seagoing notions of the matter.\r\n\r\nFour years ago at Vera Cruz our modern navy had its first taste of war.\r\nIt was only a light touch of war, and there was no doubt of the outcome;\r\nbut in little affairs men may be tried out, too. Through somebody's\r\nblunder, for which somebody should have been jacked-up, our bluejackets\r\nwere sent up in solid sections to occupy a large open area on the Vera\r\nCruz water-front. Standing there in solid columns, not knowing just what\r\nwas going to happen, but feeling to a certainty that something stirring\r\nwas going to happen, and to happen soon, they stood there grinning\r\nwidely and waiting for the ball to open. It may have been their childish\r\ninnocence, it may have been their untutored ignorance, but when that\r\nsheeted rifle fire first burst from the roof of the Naval College, and a\r\nsolid squad or two of our lads went down, and following that the snipers\r\nbegan to get them in ones and twos and threes--when that happened there\r\nwas no distressing confusion in their ranks. When, later, it became\r\nnecessary for the _Prairie_ and _Chester_ to fire just over their heads\r\nto batter the walls of that same War College, it made no difference. The\r\nships' gunnery was rapid and excellent--they knew it would be--and when\r\nthe shells went whistling through the walls of the second story, the\r\nmarines and bluejackets stood under the first story and let them\r\nwhistle. Plaster and bricks from the shaken walls came tumbling down\r\nupon them. They ducked beneath the falling mortar, some of them, but\r\nthey all took their shells standing.\r\n\r\nThey are not the sailors of classic tradition, these battleship lads of\r\nthe twentieth century. Every man to the age he lives in--it must be so.\r\nThe old phrase, \"Drunk as a sailor,\" meant, in most men's minds, drunk\r\nas a man-o'-war's man. I was born and brought up in a great\r\nseaport--Boston--and my earliest memories are of loafing days along the\r\nharbor front and the husky-voiced, roaring fellows coming ashore in the\r\npulling boats from the men-o'-war; fine, rolling-gaited fellows, in from\r\nlong cruises and flamingly eager to make the most of their short\r\nliberty. Great-hearted men, who gave truth to the phrase--\"and spending\r\nhis money like a drunken sailor\"--and knowing, usually, but two\r\ninescapable obligations--to do his duty aboard ship and to stand by a\r\nshipmate in trouble ashore. Almost any of the old-time policemen of the\r\nlarge seaports can tell you many fine tales of the riotous hours along\r\nthe water-front in the old days.\r\n\r\nSuch is the passing tradition. The present lad of the navy is creating a\r\nnew one. For one thing, he no longer gets drunk--that is, he does not\r\nget drunk by divisions. To illustrate:\r\n\r\nDuring that greatest steaming stunt in all maritime history--the cruise\r\nof our sixteen battleships with their auxiliaries around the world--all\r\nnaval records were broken in the number of enlisted men allowed ashore.\r\nEvery day in large foreign ports saw 4,000 of our bluejackets and\r\nmarines allowed shore liberty. Now consider the case of the first\r\nforeign port where liberty was granted, Rio de Janeiro in South America;\r\nand what happened in Rio was what happened in other ports.\r\n\r\nIt was five weeks or more since leaving home, and during that five weeks\r\nthey had been for twelve days steaming along one of the hottest coasts\r\n(Brazil) in all the world--the tropics--and it was summer-time once they\r\nwere south of the line; and in all that time no chance for an enlisted\r\nman to get a drink of any kind of liquor--no beer or light wine even--no\r\nmatter what the intensity of the thirst which may have possessed him.\r\n\r\nNow he is suddenly thrown ashore with his pockets full of money. He has\r\nonly to go to the paymaster and draw pretty much all he pleases. By\r\nactual figures the men of the battle fleet--about 13,000--drew $200,000\r\nin gold to spend ashore in Rio--about $15 a man. For five or six weeks\r\nnot a drop to drink, and all at once 4,000 of them thrown daily to roam\r\ninto the midst of 500 grog shops with their pockets full of money, and\r\nno restrictions placed upon them, except one: they must be back to their\r\nship that same night!\r\n\r\nI was a passenger with that battle fleet, and night after night I stood\r\non the great stone quay in Rio and watched them returning to their\r\nships. On no night did I see more than forty or fifty who might be said\r\nto be \"soused\"; on no night did I see more than a dozen or fifteen who\r\nhad to be thrown into the accommodation barge with the \"dead ones,\" the\r\nhelpless ones who were so far gone that they had to be carried up the\r\nsides of their ships from the barge which made the last rounds of the\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\nNow I would like to make an observation; gratuitous, but perhaps of\r\nhuman interest and pertinent right here: I think if we took 4,000\r\nlawyers or doctors or authors or car-drivers or clerks--4,000 of almost\r\nany sort from civil life--and locked them up so that for five or six\r\nweeks in a warm or a cold climate they could not get a drink of any kind\r\nof liquor, no matter how great their fancied or real need; and at the\r\nend of that five or six weeks took the whole 4,000 of them, with their\r\npockets full of money, and suddenly threw them into the middle of all\r\nthe grog-shops of a great city--I do think that more than forty--that\r\nis, one per cent of them--would be found \"soused\"--that is, if we had\r\nmeans of locating them all at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nThe heroic sailor of tradition has passed--a sailor of another kind, but\r\njust as efficient and just as heroic in another way--the way of his\r\nday--is rapidly creating another tradition. The lad who in the lusty\r\ndays of his youth can thus hold himself in check is a pretty good\r\nproduct of American development. He pretty generally passes up the\r\ngrog-shop, but he visits the art galleries, the museums, the cathedrals,\r\nthe K. of C.'s, and Y. M. C. A.'s ashore, takes books from the library\r\non shipboard, buys post-cards and mails them home to let his friends\r\nknow of the great things in the world. On that world cruise referred to\r\nthe men cleaned Rio de Janeiro out of 250,000 post-cards.\r\n\r\nI doubt if many of them, on the first try, could lay out on a\r\ntopsail-yard in a gale of wind without immediately falling overboard;\r\nbut they don't have to lay out on topsail-yards nowadays. They do have\r\nto shoot, however; and they can shoot. Lay a gun's crew of them behind a\r\nbig turret-gun and watch them make lacework of a target at 11,000 yards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe main question is, Have we the spirit to-day? As to that, no man\r\nhaving yet devised any apparatus wherewith to measure energy of soul and\r\nmind, it is difficult to prove to whoever will not believe, or does not\r\nin himself possess the germ, the existence of this thing that may not be\r\nmeasured by foot-rule or bushel basket. The belching of powder and the\r\nroll of drumhead do not prove it. We can always hire men to do that, and\r\nto do it well. And yet, to be present at the review described in the\r\npreceding chapter was to experience the thrill that may not be measured,\r\nto note how the enthusiasm of the occasion seemed to be animating the\r\ncrews, to share in the feeling of pride which mantled all cheeks, and,\r\nship after ship slipping past, to feel that pride of fleet intensify,\r\nuntil we echoed the cry of the Commander-in-Chief, whose enthusiasm for\r\nall that is good for the nation is unquenchable. As the President said,\r\nit was a glorious day.\r\n\r\nNo doubt of it. Men had met and there was kinship in the meeting. From\r\nthat auspicious opening in the morning when the clouds seemed to\r\ndissolve for the express purpose of allowing a fresh-washed sky to enter\r\ninto the color scheme of the beautiful picture--blue dome, chalk-white\r\nand sea-green war-ships, green and blue and white-edged little\r\nseas--until that last moment at night when the last call on the last\r\nship was blown and to its lingering cadence the last unwinking\r\nincandescent of the fairy-like illumination was switched off, leaving\r\nthe hushed and darkened fleet riding to only the necessary anchor lights\r\non the motionless, moon-lit sound--who witnessed it all might not doubt\r\nthe existence of that spirit which in conflict makes for more than\r\nthickness of armor or weight of shell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe went to war; and it was with an immense confidence in what they would\r\ndo that I heard of the sailing of our first group of destroyers for the\r\nbusiness of convoying ships and hunting U-boats on the other side. Ships\r\nwere up to date and officers and men knew their business; and there was\r\nsomething more than knowing their business.\r\n\r\nOther groups of destroyers followed that first one, and a lot of us were\r\nwondering how they were making out. They had sailed out into the\r\nAtlantic--that we knew; but what were they doing? We who knew them\r\nbelieved they were doing well. But how well?\r\n\r\nI thought it worth-while finding out. I went to Washington and from\r\nSecretary Daniels and Chief Censor George Creel secured necessary\r\ncredentials, and through the War Department the word which would put me\r\naboard a troop-ship.\r\n\r\nIt is only justice to Secretary Daniels to say that he granted me all\r\naid even though I told him I would probably work for _Collier's_ on the\r\ntrip--for _Collier's_ which had been pounding him editorially.\r\n\r\nWhat I learned of this game of escorting ships and hunting U-boats is in\r\nthe chapters which follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEING THEM ACROSS\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had been on what most anybody would agree was pretty trying sort of\r\nwork; and so, having an idea that a furlough was coming to him, he\r\napplied for it, but did not get it. The department had other things in\r\nview. Instead of going home, he took time to write a few letters,\r\nprinting the one to his little girl in big capitals, so that--being six\r\ngoing on seven--she might, with mama's help, be able to read it.\r\n\r\nThey sent him to a ship that had been running between north and south\r\nports on our own coast, shifting in winter-time to tropical waters. She\r\nwas one of a group of thirty or forty that the department had on its\r\nlittle list to be made over into transports. She was the handsomest\r\nboat, but war makes nothing of beauty. Our officer ordered all her\r\ngleaming black underpaint off, also her pure white topside enamelling\r\nwith the gold decorations here and there; then he swabbed her top and\r\nbottom with that dull blue-gray which the naval sharps say does blend\r\nbest with a deep-sea background.\r\n\r\nShe had the prettiest little lounging-room. Our officers retained\r\nthat--for even in war officers must have some place aboard ship to\r\ngather for a smoke and gossip--but they threw out the large, lovely fat\r\npieces of furniture. In case of submarine attack or an order to abandon\r\nship, the men might want to make a passage of that room in a hurry and\r\nno time there--in the dark it might be--to be falling over chairs and\r\ntables.\r\n\r\nThere was a sun-parlor, a large, splendid room with wide windows and the\r\ndeck on three sides. There were thick draperies, filmy laces, and many\r\neasy chairs. In the old days cabin passengers used to sit there and\r\nabsorb the soft tropic breezes while digesting their breakfasts. An army\r\nquartermaster-captain surveyed it with our naval officer. \"Swell,\" said\r\nthe Q. M. C. \"We'll haul down that plush and fluffy stuff, dump those\r\nchairs and rugs over the side, plant my desk here, my chief clerk's\r\nthere, my other clerks' desks over there, open those fine wide windows\r\nand let the north Atlantic breezes blow on our beaded brows while we're\r\ndoing our paper work. Fine!\"\r\n\r\nOur naval officer did that and a hundred other things to the inside and\r\noutside of the beautiful ship and reported her fit for transport\r\nservice, or as fit as ever a made-over ship could be made to be,\r\nwhereupon he was ordered to take her to such and such a dock in such and\r\nsuch a port--which he did. Then many large, heavy cases were lowered\r\ninto her hold, and troops and troops and more troops filed aboard and\r\ntook up what was left of the spaces between decks with themselves and\r\ntheir war gear.\r\n\r\nShe lay then with her water-line a foot deeper than anybody around there\r\never remembered seeing her in her swell passenger days; then she shoved\r\nout into the stream and kicked her way down the harbor, and as she did\r\nso, though there was not a single trooper's head showing above her rail,\r\neverybody seemed to know. Passing tugs, motor-boats, ferry-boats blew\r\ntheir whistles--every kind of a boat that had a whistle blew it--and\r\nthere was an excursion boat loaded down with women and children. Her\r\nband had been playing ragtime, but it suddenly stopped and broke into\r\n\"Good-by, Good Luck, God Bless You,\" to the troop-ship bound for France.\r\n\r\nThere was a war-ship waiting below--not the biggest by a good deal in\r\nour fleet, but big enough to have hope one day of firing her broadside\r\non the battle-line. But the great duty of a war-ship is to be immediately\r\nuseful. She was there, and smaller war-ships with her, to see that the\r\ntroop-ships got protection on the run across.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She shoved out into the stream and kicked her way down\r\nthe harbor, and as she did so ... everybody seemed to know.]\r\n\r\nOur troop-ship, other troop-ships, every one in turn, steamed up,\r\nreported her presence, and tucked into a berth under the wings of the\r\nbig war-ship; and there they stayed until night, until the signal came\r\nto get under way. When it did, one after the other they up-anchored and\r\nkicked into line. They had been warned to make no fuss in going, and\r\nthey made none. From somewhere ashore a great search-light swept our top\r\nstructure, swept every top structure as we filed out. Some one on each\r\ntop structure must have given the proper sign, for that was all.\r\n\r\nAll that night, and next day, for days and days thereafter, with\r\nshifting formations and varying speeds, we steamed. All were good,\r\nseaworthy ships, but little things will happen. There was one that was\r\nalways lagging. The flag-ship, meaning the war-ship of most tonnage,\r\ninquired why. The answer came, whereat the war-ship of most tonnage\r\nshowed right there that she was fit to do something more than furnish\r\nlong-reaching guns for the fleet's protection.\r\n\r\nThe next thing the fleet knew they were ordered to shut off steam. They\r\ndid so. It was a perfect, calm day, and the ships lay, still as paint\r\nbetween a clear blue sky and a deep-blue sea while a boat-load of\r\nbluejackets from the big fighting ship rowed across a swell so gentle\r\nthat it seemed to be only serving to put life into a picture. The\r\nlagging steamer had been short a few oilers or firemen or water-tenders.\r\nThe big ship had them to spare. After that the slow one picked right up.\r\nSoon it was standard speed with everybody in proper alignment again.\r\n\r\nNot often do seagoing people get the chance to see a fleet of merchant\r\nsteamers cruising the wide ocean. A full-rigged sailing-ship, a\r\nsteam-collier, a tramp steamer, all came out of their way in one day to\r\nview the strange sight. As they did so, one of our smaller and faster\r\nwar-ships would trot over to have a closer peek in turn at the curious\r\nones; to ask them questions; probably also to tell them to keep their\r\nwireless mouths shut, if they had any.\r\n\r\nOne day one big freighter did not answer signals promptly. Perhaps she\r\ncould not read them. In these war times it is not too easy to get crews\r\nwho are sea-wise in every detail--the expert signalman among the\r\nofficers might have been off watch and having a nap. Anyway, one of our\r\nlittle fighting fellows went bounding after her. It was like watching a\r\nsheep-dog at work. The war-ship moved up from behind, drew up, and then,\r\nshowing her teeth, headed the freighter the other way and held her\r\nheaded that way while she put an officer aboard and asked an explanation,\r\nwhich was probably given and doubtless all right, for the officer came\r\nback and the freighter resumed her regular course. Day in and day out\r\nthat was the way of it, every passing ship being viewed as suspect and\r\nour own ships, of varying speeds and tonnage, trying to keep a good\r\nalignment.\r\n\r\nThe weather generally was fine, but one morning we ran into a fog. A fog\r\nhas its virtues; a submarine cannot see you in a fog. But neither can\r\nyou see a submarine. And somewhere handy to you is a bunch of your own\r\nships, and no telling when one of them may come riding out of the mist\r\nand climb aboard by way of your port or starboard quarter!\r\n\r\nA whistle by day or a search-light by night would have been a great help\r\nto our naval officer on the bridge during that fog, but he was denied\r\nthat. So he made out (as did every other commander on every other bridge\r\nduring the fog) with whatever other means he could devise. Nothing\r\nhappened to us.\r\n\r\nThe fog passed on, and then one day came a slaty gray sea and a slaty\r\nsky. Gray seas look hard; white crests moving across gray seas look hard\r\ntoo. Our naval officer took time to look around on them. Gray hulls were\r\nsmashing high bows into them, making boiling white water of the hard\r\ngray sea and throwing it to either side in fine, high-rolling billows as\r\nthey pressed on. They were a fine sight then, with the smoke pouring out\r\nand trailing low from some of them. They were not trying to make smoke,\r\nbut if a ship must make smoke, it will not be seen so far on a gray day.\r\n\r\nOur naval officer held the bridge from early that morning to nine\r\no'clock that night. He had an idea that he might be able to sneak in a\r\ncouple of hours' sleep against the strain of the later night. It was not\r\nbad weather when he left--a good breeze blowing and plenty of white\r\nshowing. It was dirty, but not bad weather. He got in one hour in his\r\nbunk, turning in with his clothes on, when he was called to go on the\r\nbridge again. Something had happened. He could feel the increasing wind\r\nbefore he was fairly rolled out of his bunk.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped out on deck he could see that the lookouts had adopted\r\nlife-belts for the night. The lookouts were men from among the troops,\r\nand now each man as he went off watch was handing over his life-belt to\r\nthe next coming on. They had had to use the soldiers for lookouts. In\r\nthese war days no merchant ship can supply from her regular crew\r\none-tenth of the men needed for lookout work in the war zone. The\r\nsoldiers were all right, but just then our naval officer felt sorry for\r\nthem. He had been having them up before him afternoons, lecturing them\r\non their duties as lookouts. That very afternoon he had had a bunch of\r\nthem before him while he explained a few new things. He had spent extra\r\ntime on the men who were to be on forward watch this very night, with\r\nthe men who were to go into the bow or into the forward crow's nest. And\r\nnow they were there, buried as the bow went smash into it, or--those of\r\nthem who had drawn the crow's nest--swinging a hundred feet in the air.\r\nAll right for old seagoers, but most of these boys had never in their\r\nlives before been on an ocean-going ship. Some had never even seen a big\r\nship until they came to the seacoast for their trip. They had great\r\neyesight, some of these young fellows--men who had lain on the\r\nbull's-eye at a thousand yards regularly were bound to have that--and\r\nthey made good lookouts once they got the idea, but climbing the last\r\ntwenty feet of that ladder to the crow's nest, leaning back under part\r\nof the time with life-belt stuffed under their overcoats--they surely\r\nmust have been thinking that a soldier's duties were difficult as well\r\nas various in these days of war.\r\n\r\nA ship on tossing seas and the wind blowing a dirge through the\r\nrigging--well, a man may be brave enough to fight all the Germans this\r\nside the Russian line, but if he is new to sea life he is apt to see\r\nthings. Two soldiers were standing on deck when our naval officer came\r\nout of his room. They were not on guard. They did not have to be\r\nthere--they were staying awake on their own account. One said to the\r\nother: \"There, there--look! Ain't that a submarine?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a shadow as high as a house. \"If that is a submarine,\" thinks our\r\nofficer, \"then it is good night to us, for she's a whale of a one!\"\r\n\r\nIt was no submarine. It was the shadow of one of their own ships which\r\nhad been driven out of column.\r\n\r\nIt was blowing hard when our officer made the bridge. He could not see\r\nfar, but far enough to see that the ocean was black, and that across the\r\nblack of it the white patches were flying--dead white patches leaping\r\nhigh in the night.\r\n\r\nThe fleet was in direct column ahead, or should have been. Some were\r\nsurely having their troubles staying there. This steaming close behind a\r\nship, with another ship close behind you--and you have to be close up to\r\nsee from one to the other on such a night--made me think as I stood\r\nunder the bridge that night: \"Give me all the submarines in the world\r\nbefore this with a fleet that has not had a chance to practise\r\nevolutions.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not a steaming light of any kind, not even one shaded little\r\none in the stern, which an enemy might see and, seeing, swing in behind\r\nit. Rather than show even the smallest little guiding light, our fellows\r\npreferred to steam this way in the night.\r\n\r\nThe glad morning came, glad for the reason that an almost warm, bright\r\nsun came with it. The sun showed three ships gone from the column. There\r\nwas more than one of us who wished that we too had gone from the column\r\nabout six hours ago. We would have slept better. Still, it was a good\r\nexperience to have--behind you. Wind and sea went down; all hands felt\r\nbetter--especially the lookouts. Those who came down from the crow's\r\nnest looked as if the grace of God had suddenly fallen on them.\r\n\r\nBy and by we picked up the drifters. They were looking just as hard for\r\nus as we were for them; and later that day we ran into our escorts from\r\nthe other side. Everybody at once felt as if the trip was as good as\r\nover. The fact was that the worst part of the war zone was ahead of us.\r\nAll hands were still turning in with life-belts handy, and most of them\r\nwith clothes on, but there was a feeling that now it was up to these new\r\nescorts.\r\n\r\nBefore we reached France on this run we were in a U-boat fight, which I\r\nshall tell of later. What I want to say now is that the submarine fight\r\nhad an enjoyable side to it, but as for that night run of our troop-ships\r\nin gale and sea--a big ship just ahead, a big ship just behind, big\r\nhigh-bowed ships plunging down at fourteen knots an hour from roaring\r\nwaters in the dark--there was no fun in that!\r\n\r\nOf the scores of devices the fleet used to beat the U-boats on that run\r\nacross, a man can say nothing here. But to get back: our naval officer\r\nstuck to his bridge until one most beautiful morning he took his ship\r\ninto a most beautiful port on a most beautiful shore. I never before\r\nheard anybody so describe that same port, but the general verdict says\r\nit did look pretty good.\r\n\r\nThis story of our troop-ship's run across is given from the view-point\r\nof the naval officer in charge. It could just as well have been written\r\nfrom the view-point of the merchant captain or his officers aboard--all\r\non the job; or the chief engineer or his assistants--all on the job, and\r\nwho put in more than one hour guessing at what was going on above; or\r\nfrom the view-point of the quartermaster captain, or his clerks, or the\r\noilers, or the firemen, or the water-tenders, or the cooks, or anybody\r\nelse, high or low, in the ship's regular service.\r\n\r\nThis transport service is one tough game. It is well enough for us who\r\nhave but one trip to make. But one trip after another! They had good\r\nright to look a bit younger when they made the other side. But before we\r\ncan win this war we've got to get the million or two or three million\r\nmen across; and the millions of tons of supplies. Somebody has got to\r\nsee them across. These men on the troop-ships are doing it. May nothing\r\nhappen to them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE U-BOATS APPEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soldier lookouts in the forward crow's nest had been especially\r\nadvised to have an eye out for the convoys which were to pick us up as\r\nwe neared the other side; and they were very much on the job.\r\n\r\nOne bright morning came: \"Smoke three points off the port bow.... Smoke\r\nbroad off the starboard bow.... Smoke dead ahead.... One point off the\r\n... Broad off the ...\" and so on. Their excited calls rattled down like\r\nrapid fire to the bridge; the thrill in their voices rolled like a wave\r\nthrough the ship. That smoke, incidentally, meant that the strangers,\r\nwhoever they were, had already identified us and so were not afraid to\r\nlet us see them.\r\n\r\nEverybody that was not already on deck came running up to have a look\r\nfor himself. It was our escort. Darting across our bows they\r\ncame--low-riding, slim, gray bodies. The ranking one reported to our\r\nflag-ship; and all, without any fuss or extra foam, took position and\r\nwent to work as though they had been there for weeks. And as they did\r\nour big war-ship and the little ones which had come across with her\r\nwheeled about and went off. There was no ceremonious leave-taking. They\r\nsimply turned on their heels and flew. They might as well have said: \"We\r\nare glad to have met you and been with you, but we can do no more for\r\nyou, so good-by and good luck; we're going back home as fast as we can\r\nget there.\"\r\n\r\nA soldier watched them going and said: \"The night before we left home I\r\nwent to a show, and a fellow sang: 'Good-by, Broadway! Hello, France!' I\r\nthought it was great. I know what they're saying aboard those ships\r\nthere now. 'Hello, Broadway! Good-by, France!' is what they're saying.\r\nAnd I betcher it'll be a straight line with no time wasted zigzagging\r\nfor them on the way back!\"\r\n\r\nHe had it about right. They carried the most eloquent sterns that any of\r\nus had seen on ships for a long time. The big one in the middle, the\r\nothers like chickens under either wing--away they went, belting it for\r\nabout sixteen knots good. In one half-hour all we could see of them was\r\na cloud of smoke to the west'ard. Just how far off the French coast we\r\nwere at this time does not matter here, or from what direction we were\r\napproaching; but we were far enough off for that group of destroyers to\r\nshow how they went about their work of guarding the troop-ships. To comb\r\nthe sea about us was their mission; and they were attending to it every\r\nminute. The fleet steamed on.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded under advices not to fall asleep with too much clothes on,\r\nand never to get too far away from our life-belts. It may have been true\r\nthat some men slept with their life-belts on, but it is probably not\r\ntrue that one man took his to the bathroom with him--not true because\r\nabout the time we got that far along the steward refused to prepare any\r\nmore baths. He had enough on his mind, he said, without fussing with\r\nbaths.\r\n\r\nThere was one place we looked forward to passing with lively feelings.\r\nWe may not name the place here, but here is how it was described: \"Ever\r\nbeen to that big aquarium in Naples? Yes? Well, remember those\r\ndevil-fish hiding behind the rock on the bottom? Along comes an innocent\r\nyoung fish who is a stranger to those waters. Mr. Devilfish, hiding\r\nbehind, has a peek at it coming. He waits. Mr. Young Fish drifts by his\r\nhiding-place, and then--Good night, young fishie.\"\r\n\r\nThat kind of talk in the watches of the night sounded like lively action\r\nbefore us. We waited for--call it the Devilfish's Cave--and waited; and\r\nthe first thing we knew when we came to inquire further about it, we\r\nwere safely past it, with never a sign of any devil-fish, unless it\r\nwould be the one torpedo which went by the bow of one of us from some\r\ndistance one noontime. Some distance it must have been because it was a\r\nclear day with a smooth sea, and under such weather conditions, with the\r\nhundreds of wide-awake lookouts in the fleet, no U-boat could have put\r\nup a periscope within any near distance and not be seen by somebody. As\r\nfor long-distance shots from submarines--there is small need to worry\r\nabout them. Subs like to get within a thousand yards or less. Those\r\nthree and four mile shots--it is like trying to hit a sea-gull with a\r\nrifle. Amateurs try that kind of shooting, but the professional, who has\r\nto reckon the cost of powder and shot, lets it pass. Not that the\r\nGermans are sparing of the cost of war, but a sub which has to make a\r\nvoyage of three thousand miles to take on a fresh load of torpedoes is\r\nnot firing too many for the mere practice.\r\n\r\nWe drew near the coast of France, and still nothing had happened. We\r\nwere getting hails, of course, from the lookouts. There was one who\r\ncalled it a dull watch when he did not see at least one periscope. He\r\nhad never seen a periscope in his life, but he had read about periscopes.\r\nOne night just at dark he stood us all on our heads by reporting one\r\njust alongside. We all got a flash at it then, an ominous object, bobbing\r\nunder our port quarter, and then it went down into our wake. It bobbed up\r\nagain, and we all had another look. It was a beer-keg. The ship's first\r\nofficer, the one who had a gold medal as big as a saucer for saving life\r\nat sea, eyed the keg, and then he eyed the lookout, saying: \"An empty one\r\ntoo! If you'd only report a full one, we might gaff it aboard.\"\r\n\r\nWhen that same first officer was one day asked if he intended taking his\r\nbig medal with him in case we had to take to the boats, he replied: \"With\r\ntwenty-eight persons in the boat! Good Lord, don't you think she'll be\r\ncarrying enough freight?\"\r\n\r\nWe steamed along, dark night astern this time and the white morning\r\nabove our bow. The bridge--three naval and two ship's officers--had for\r\nsome time been using the glasses. From aloft forward came the sudden\r\nyell: \"Land ho!\"\r\n\r\nThe bridge nodded that it heard. \"Land ho!\" repeated the lookout\r\nstentoriously. \"Two points off the port bow,\" and then, peering\r\ndoubtfully down at the bridge: \"Am I right?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are,\" said the bridge sweetly; \"we've been looking at it for half\r\nan hour.\" Which was rather rough, for to shore-going eyes land does at\r\nfirst look like a low cloud on the horizon and, naturally, a fellow\r\nwants to make sure.\r\n\r\nPretty soon we could most of us see it from the deck, and it did look\r\ngood. I once saw the flat, bleak Atlantic coast of Patagonia after ten\r\ndays at sea, and the high iron wintry coast of Newfoundland after\r\nanother period at sea, and I clearly recall that even they both looked\r\nlike fine countries. And the coast of France was neither bleak nor icy,\r\nso you may guess that it was a pleasing sight on this summer morning. It\r\nwas a dream of a day, the sea like a green-tinted mirror, the sky blue\r\nas paint, and the softest little breath of air floating off the land to\r\nus. We were perhaps ten miles offshore.\r\n\r\nThe enchanted land lay before us and our troubles behind us--or so we\r\nthought--and yet we were many of us disappointed. After our more than\r\nthree thousand miles we had not even caught sight of a U-boat.\r\n\r\nNow, we probably did not want to see one, but we sort of had an idea\r\nthat we were entitled to have one pop up and then disappear. Something\r\nto talk about, without anybody coming to harm through it--that was about\r\nour composite idea.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are compensations for all things; we could now prepare\r\npeacefully for going ashore. I was in the lounge-room below sharpening a\r\npencil, and, there being no waste-basket handy, carefully shunting the\r\nshavings into a writing-desk drawer.\r\n\r\nThe fire-alarm rang. That was the signal to hurry on deck with your\r\nlife-belt, take your station by your boat, and prepare to abandon ship.\r\nBut we had been doing that every day since we left home. The first time\r\nwe heard that call we had gone jumping, but after the third or fourth\r\ntime we moved more leisurely.\r\n\r\nSome took their life-belts from their rooms and started up. Every\r\nsoldier, of course, grabbed one from where they were piled up in the\r\npassageways and went at once. They had no option. Their officers would\r\nget after them if they did not.\r\n\r\nI thought I would finish sharpening my pencil. I thought I heard a blast\r\nfrom a ship's whistle somewhere outside; but I was not sure. Then I\r\nheard a blast from our own ship's whistle. Wugh-wugh-wugh! I did not\r\nwait for any more. I did not finish sharpening the pencil. I did not\r\nwait to shut the desk drawer. I did not do anything but move. There were\r\nsix blasts from the whistle, and six blasts meant U-boats.\r\n\r\nThere was a heavy-set officer coming down the passageway. He was heavier\r\nby twenty pounds than I was, but I had more speed. I know I had. Not\r\nsince the winter's day on George's Bank a quartering sea chased me down\r\nthe cabin companionway of the _Charles W. Parker_ of Gloucester have I\r\nmoved so fast on a ship, and I was fifteen years younger then. We bounced\r\noff each other. We did not stop to talk when we straightened out. He went\r\nhis way and I went mine, and if I looked anything like him, then my jaw\r\nwas thrust out and my eyes had an earnest look in them.\r\n\r\nMy life-belt was under my bunk. It did not stay there long. I went back\r\ndown the passageway jumping. There was a fine crush going up to the\r\nboat-deck. Only a seagoing man knows how to take a ship's ladder with\r\nspeed. You just got to have practice at it. There were some fine\r\nathletic boys among the troopers, but \"Sweet mother,\" wailed a ship's\r\nman, \"are those new army shoes made of leather, or are they lead that\r\nthey move so slow?\" And that comment did not have to travel a lonesome\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nWhile scooting up the ladder we heard a gun; and another gun. As we made\r\nthe boat-deck there was another ship barking out six short blasts.\r\n\r\nThe ships of the fleet, when we got to where we could see them, were\r\nheaded every which way. We could feel our own ship heel over--she turned\r\nso sharply. Every ship in the fleet was going it--right angles, quarter\r\nangles, all degrees of angles. But what impressed us most--we almost\r\nlaughed to see her--was the lubber of the fleet. She was twice the tonnage\r\nof most of us, and early in the run across she had brought anguish to our\r\nsouls by the way she lagged. \"You bum, you loafer, you old cart-horse, why\r\ndon't you move up?\" our soldiers used to yell across at her. She had not\r\nthen enough men in her steam department to keep her engines warm, so she\r\nreported. But now she had steam enough. She was wide and high, a huge hulk\r\nof a ship, and here she was now charging--charging was the word--like a\r\nmotor-boat at where somebody said the U-boat had just submerged. Whether\r\nshe got her U-boat, I don't know; but she certainly did cut through the\r\nwater for about a mile.\r\n\r\nThe ship next behind us went after something; and the ship next ahead\r\nwent tearing away after something else, and another ship--but, man, a\r\nbattalion of eyes could not follow them all. A destroyer went--zizz-sh\r\nzizz--a thirty-odd knot clip--and the next thing we saw was a ten-foot\r\ncolumn of solid white water shooting straight up beside that destroyer.\r\n\r\nAnd then came the terrific Bo-o-om! Our ship shook from one end to the\r\nother. I thought it came from inside of us--that it was a loading-port\r\ndoor let drop by some careless ship's man below. The ship's officer in\r\ncharge of our life-boat thought so, too. He stepped to the ship's side\r\nto look down. \"That one, he should be put in the brig--scaring us all\r\nlike that!\" I agreed with him heartily, only I thought he should be put\r\nin a second brig after he got out of the first one. Some time later we\r\nlearned that it was the shock from the bomb dropped by the destroyer,\r\nfrom which you can gauge what chance the submarine will have which\r\nhappens to catch one of those bombs on its back.\r\n\r\nWe carried two 5-inch guns in our bow and two astern. Those gun crews\r\nhad been standing by those guns from the first day out. For the last\r\nthree days they had been sleeping near them in their life-jackets and\r\ntaking their meals standing beside them. They were not going to be left\r\nout of it. About a thousand yards away some one reported a floating\r\ntorpedo. Whether it was a live or a spent one made no matter. It was too\r\nsoft a target; besides, some ship in the hurry of manoeuvring might\r\nrun into it. Bang! went two of our 5-inch fellows, one from each end of\r\nthe ship and both together.\r\n\r\nThat was when we heard from our chief engineer. He had been below from\r\nthe beginning, and knew from the way the bells were coming down from the\r\nbridge that there was something doing topside. When the destroyer\r\ndropped her first bomb he wondered if the ship was torpedoed. He waited,\r\nand his men, with their shovels and slice-bars and oil-cans--they\r\nwaited, every one of them, with one sharp eye to the nearest ash-hoist,\r\nwhich reminded the chief that he would never leave home again--and this\r\ntime he meant it--without installing those four more ladders leading up\r\nfrom the engine and fire-room quarters to the decks. No, sir, he would\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nBut nothing happened! And then those two 5-inch guns went off together.\r\nWar-ships are built to withstand impact, but merchant-ships--no. This\r\ntime the chief was sure she was torpedoed. His fire-room force were\r\nmostly Spaniards. He used to talk at table about his fire-room gang.\r\n\"You would think, with your ship coming through the war zone and your\r\nwatch down in the bottom of her, that you would want to go up topside\r\nwhen your watch was done, for, of course, if any U-boat got the ship, it\r\nwould be the fellows below who would first get the full benefit.\" But\r\nthat gang of his! \"Doggone, they'd sit there when their watch was over,\r\nsix or eight of 'em, and play some cross-eyed Spanish card-game for a\r\npeseta a corner. What d'y' know about them?\"\r\n\r\nThe chief's gang could not talk English, but they had speaking eyes.\r\nThey now looked at the chief, and he went up to have a peek. He came\r\nback soon. \"They are having target practice,\" he told them. He had been\r\nrunning the Caribbean ports long enough to be able to say that much in\r\nSpanish; but more than all he smiled as he said it. You want to smile to\r\nget away with anything like that in the fire-room of a troop-ship in the\r\nU-boat country.\r\n\r\nEvery ship in the fleet was now having something to say with her guns;\r\nand with their incessant manoeuvring at such close quarters the sea\r\nwas all torn up by their wakes. Two or three wakes or bow waves would\r\ncross each other, and the sea would roll up with a bounding white crest.\r\nThere were also the wakes of hidden submarines. You could tell them if\r\nyou saw any by the way they did not stop in one place; they moved on.\r\nWhen a gunner saw a submarine wake he fired; where he wasn't sure he\r\nfired anyway. What was he there for? Bang! Boom! Solid shot were\r\nricochetting, piling up little white splashes, and the shrapnel were\r\nmaking little holes and bursting into little white smoke puffs all over\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nYou must not forget that it was a beautiful day and a perfectly calm sea\r\nwith the shore of France looming like a blue mirage on the horizon. It\r\nlasted about forty minutes altogether, and through it all the little\r\ndestroyers--don't forget them--were weaving in and out among the big\r\nships; and on the big ships were thousands of troopers, white life-belts\r\naround their olive-drab uniforms, standing steadily by life-boats and\r\nrafts.\r\n\r\nOur fellows on the destroyers did handle their little ships well. And\r\nthe troop-ships were handled well--no collisions and no gun-shells going\r\naboard anybody else. A few went across other people's bows and sterns,\r\nbut not too near to worry. And in the middle of it all, our guns made so\r\nmuch noise that before we heard them we saw them--two airplanes,\r\nwhirring and cavorting about and above us. Whenever they saw a destroyer\r\nturn and shoot, they would turn and shoot after the destroyer. They\r\ncould move about three times as fast as a destroyer, and so quite often\r\nbeat the destroyer to it.\r\n\r\nLater the airplanes escorted us into port. They were big, powerful\r\nbiplanes, and carried a sky-pointing gun mounted forward and the colors\r\nof France painted on their little wings aft. They kept circling about us\r\nuntil we made our harbor. Whenever they swooped low enough our troopers\r\ngave them a fine cheer.\r\n\r\nMy job being to tell what I saw and heard, I want to say here that\r\nthroughout the entire mêlée I never saw one periscope! And there were\r\nthousands like me who never saw a periscope. But there were hundreds of\r\nothers--cool, sensible people--who are ready to make affidavits that\r\nthey did see periscopes.\r\n\r\nWhy did not more of us see any? Well, a submarine commander needs to\r\nturn up his periscope for only four, five, six, or seven seconds to have\r\na look. If you do not happen to be gazing directly at the spot, you do\r\nnot see it or the white bone which it makes going through the water.\r\n\r\nOn my ship the ranking officer was a regular army colonel who had seen\r\nactive and dangerous service in the Philippines and elsewhere. He is\r\ngiven rather to understatement than overstatement of facts--a cool,\r\nlevel-headed observer. He saw a periscope. We had another officer who\r\nhad been in the service in the Spanish War, had got out and was now\r\nback. He was probably the best lookout of all the army officers in the\r\nship--a solid, substantial man with a keen eye. He could see what\r\nanybody else could see, but further than that you had to show him.\r\nSeveral of us had already christened him \"Show me.\" He reported two\r\nperiscopes. Now he had never seen a submarine operating in his life. I\r\nasked him to describe the action of the periscope. He described it\r\nperfectly as I had noticed it in trial trips of submarines off Cape Cod,\r\nwhich is where the Electric Boat Company used to try theirs out before\r\nturning them over to purchasers.\r\n\r\nMy own notion of it is that the U-boats have many of us bluffed. They\r\nmust be capable men who go in submarines; of good nerve, quick wit, and\r\nthe power to withstand long nervous strain. Such men in a submarine are\r\ngoing to throw great scares into people of less capacity on surface\r\nships. Put such men somewhere else than in a submarine and they will\r\noutwit men not so well equipped for the war game.\r\n\r\nBut these men, no men, can make the submarine do impossible things.\r\nBefore firing a torpedo the submarine must come near enough to the\r\nsurface to stick out her periscope, to have a look around to locate her\r\ntarget. In sticking out the periscope, lookouts on ships are likely to\r\nsee it. On merchant ships they do not keep a lookout which combs the sea\r\nthoroughly; they do not carry men enough for that. The strain of such a\r\nlookout is great. Men cannot stand to it as to an ordinary watch; they\r\nhave to be relieved frequently; and so submarines may have an advantage\r\nover merchant ships, especially if the merchant ships are slow-moving\r\nfreighters. But a war-ship, or a troop-ship in convoy is something else.\r\nTroop-ships carry an immense number of lookouts, not overworked men who\r\nare liable to go to sleep on watch, but keen-eyed young fellows of high\r\nvitality, surrounded by other young fellows of high vitality, and all\r\ncompeting to see who can see something first.\r\n\r\nThey will spot a periscope, under normal conditions, at a pretty good\r\ndistance; which does not mean that that periscope is at once going to be\r\nblown out of the water. Hitting a piece of 4-inch pipe at any distance\r\nis not easy; the pipe moving and the ship moving does not make it any\r\neasier.\r\n\r\nBut the submarine has shown herself. To get her torpedo home she will\r\nhave to move nearer. With a thousand eyes looking for her and five, six,\r\na dozen ships with four guns or more apiece waiting to have a crack at\r\nher, she is not going to have a pleasant time after she moves nearer.\r\nShe must show her periscope again to locate her target. To show her\r\nperiscope she must get her hull somewhere near the surface; it takes a\r\nlittle time--not so much, but a little time to get her hull safely below\r\nagain; and while she is doing that who can say that not one of our five,\r\nsix, or a dozen ships will be handy to the spot? And if one of our ships\r\nshould happen to be handy enough, what can save the submarine from being\r\nrammed? And if she is rammed there is no hope for her--she is gone.\r\n\r\nI am pretty much of one mind with our first officer in this submarine\r\nmatter. In the middle of the combat off the French coast he was making\r\nthe rounds, cutting away the lashings which held the life-boats to the\r\ndavits--this in case we had to leave the ship. He had a squint at the\r\nbanging guns, the charging troop-ships, the flying destroyers; and then\r\nhe looked up long enough to say: \"A fat chance a U-boat would have if\r\nshe so much as stuck her nose out. In four seconds she'd be like a\r\nrabbit among a pack of hunting-dogs. She might get away, but I bet you\r\nno bookmaker would take her end of it.\"\r\n\r\nThis argument does not apply to a slow-steaming freighter going it\r\nalone; it is for the matter of troop-ships moving at a fairly good\r\nspeed. For myself that time the fleet steamed in direct column ahead,\r\none ship jam up behind another, in a rough sea and on a black night, at\r\nhigh speed without lights of any kind, they did a more difficult thing\r\nthan to evade or stand off half a dozen U-boat attacks. No fleet of\r\nships can be put beyond all danger of submarine attack, but the danger\r\nto the subs can be made so great that it won't be worth the price the\r\nattacking force will pay.\r\n\r\nI do not know how many U-boats were in that attack. The official figures\r\nwill no doubt be given out in time. Our moderate estimators here put it\r\ndown as three, with one transport ramming and sinking one U-boat. Two\r\nhonest lads of one of our own forward gun crews say that our ship bumped\r\nover another. They felt the bump. Perhaps they did, but bluejackets at\r\ntwenty years of age are apt to be optimistic, as witness:\r\n\r\nThe day after that U-boat fight the skipper, first officer, chief\r\nengineer, and myself were trying our French on a waiter in a café\r\nashore, but not quite putting it over; we had to resort to a little\r\nEnglish to get action for one important item of our meal. A party of\r\nAmerican bluejackets--gun crews--were at another table. They heard us\r\nspeak English, whereat one of them called over: \"Say, you guys comprong\r\nEnglish? Wee, wee? Then you oughter been where we were yesterday. Yuh'd\r\nseen something. Fighting U-boats we were. Comprong? U-boats--wee, wee,\r\nU-boats. Thirty-six of 'em came after us an' we sunk twelve. Whaddyer\r\nknow about that?\" We did not know, so we opened up a bottle of the\r\nordinary red wine of the country, price deux francs, and drank to their\r\nenthusiastic health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE CHANNEL\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get out of France after getting in, a man has to go to Paris, see the\r\nprefect of police, various consuls, and so on. It was all interesting--the\r\nlife in Paris--but it had nothing to do with U-boats. I had to go to\r\nEngland, and to make England, I had to go to Havre.\r\n\r\nAnd I was in Havre. Looking out the window at a roof across the narrow\r\nstreet was a sign which read Hotel of the Six Allies. The Six looked as\r\nthough it had been painted over. The head waiter told me later that it\r\nhad. It had begun at three, then it became four--five--now six. But\r\nthere were more than six now--did not the great United States count? Oh,\r\nyes, truly yes--but the paint and painters! They were growing more\r\nscarce. The war--yes. Everything was the war.\r\n\r\nThe head waiter was a little old fellow with a round back, a quizzical\r\neye, and the hair of a first violin. After I beat my way by main\r\nstrength through three table-d'hôte meals with him he let me know that\r\nhe could talk English. Why hadn't he told me so before? Oh! Did I not\r\nwish to practise my French? So many did, and if they made him understand,\r\nthe tips were sometimes more inspiring.\r\n\r\nThe steamer for England had been scheduled to leave the night of the day\r\nour train arrived, but she did not leave. We did not learn whether it\r\nwas the full moon or the U-boats shifting their hunting-grounds or the\r\nlate air-raids on the south coast of England. Whatever the cause, no one\r\ngrowled much. The steamship people and the government were doing their\r\nbest with a difficult service. The delay gave us another day to look the\r\nport over. I had been there years before. Then it was all French; now it\r\nseemed to be mostly British. The streets, the shops, the cafés, were\r\ncrowded with English, Canadian, and Australian soldiers. British soldiers\r\nwere running the tram-cars. In the country outside was a large British\r\ncamp. The French owners of the ships and of the cafés in the narrow\r\nstreets near the jetties catered especially to the British soldier and\r\nsailor. English tobacco, English rosbif--they advertised these in quaintly\r\nworded signs.\r\n\r\nShips lay between the jetties and the breakwater, coasting and deep-water\r\nsteamers, and the little fishing-cutters with the tanned sails. There was\r\na fleet (or a flock) of seaplanes all ready to take to either the water or\r\nthe air. They took to both while we looked, hurdling the breakwater from\r\nthe basin to get more quickly to some smoke on the horizon. They were\r\nbrand-new planes all, with the most beautiful polished maple pontoons and\r\nbright varnish over paint that still smelled fresh.\r\n\r\nSoldiers not so worn and weary as those on the hospital veranda came\r\ndown to the jetty promenade. Priests, nursing sisters, other soldiers\r\nand sailors came also. What interested them most was the sun shining on\r\nthe bright new wood of the planes flying out to see what the smoke\r\nmeant. It was a ship from across the ocean somewhere, and the planes\r\ncircled it into the basin--one more ship which had beat the U-boat game\r\nand brought home something needed. There was some noise along the jetty\r\nand yet more noise in the wide and narrow streets of the town--clanging\r\ntrams, whip-cracking fiacres, yelling newsboys, honking taxis, and\r\nsoldiers and sailors tramping the pavements. Noise enough, and of the\r\nkind befitting a Channel port in war time; but for a time at least we\r\nheard the noise let down, and the bustle softened.\r\n\r\nIn a wide street of shops appeared a white-haired priest with a white\r\ncrucifix held high before him. Behind him was another priest reading\r\nfrom a book of prayer. Two laymen came next, bearing a little\r\nwhite-painted table with a little white coffin--a cheap board\r\ncoffin--resting on it. There was a canopy of plain white boards over the\r\nlittle coffin. There were a few white blossoms on the canopy and beside\r\nthe coffin a few lilies of the valley--only a few.\r\n\r\nTwo other laymen followed the coffin bearers. All the men were\r\nbareheaded. Three women--young women and young mothers to look\r\nat--followed the two men. One of the young women was in deep black. A\r\ngroup of little girls followed the young woman. Two very old women came\r\nlast. No more than that, walking through a crowded street at two o'clock\r\nof a bright day!\r\n\r\nIt was on us almost before we saw it. Men took off their hats as it\r\npassed; women blessed themselves. Sometimes men's lips murmured a short\r\nprayer; always the women did. The soldiers and sailors, when they were\r\nFrench, saluted nearly always; the British sometimes. The officers, if\r\nanything, saluted more profoundly than the enlisted men, and, when they\r\ndid not stop dead, held a hand to their caps for eight or ten paces in\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nTwo soldiers were talking with two girls of the streets. One of the\r\nsoldiers took off his cap. One of the girls stopped talking to say a\r\nlittle word of prayer. Both soldiers faced about, and all four gazed in\r\nsilence for long after the little cortège had passed on. Then the first\r\nsoldier put on his cap, all faced about, and resumed their talk, but\r\nmore slowly and not quite so loudly as before.\r\n\r\nAn English Tommy was driving a tram--a swearing Tommy that you could\r\nhear a block away. He came on the mourners from behind. He was in a\r\nhurry, and by clanging his bell he could have crowded by. But he held\r\nthe tram in check, nursing it so as not to frighten the two old women in\r\nthe rear--until they came to a wide square. Here there was room. He\r\nclanged his bell, not too loudly, turned on the juice, and hurried to\r\nmake up for lost time. Men are being killed by the million over here,\r\nand other men who have been there--these very men on these streets--will\r\ntell you that they hardly turn their heads to see one more killed. But a\r\nlittle child is different.\r\n\r\nOur steamer was to sail next night--at what hour no one could say, but\r\nit was well to be there in good time, we were told, so we went with the\r\nhotel bus. A little porter woman was there with my 70-pound bag before I\r\neven knew \"things were ready\"; and she said she did not roll it down the\r\nfive flights from my room. She carried it every stair step of the way.\r\nHer husband was in the war, and she had five children and it required\r\nmore than a few sous in the week for five children, the eldest fourteen.\r\nI agreed that it did.\r\n\r\nSwinging on to the jetty, we had to take notice of a shop advertising to\r\nrent life-saving apparatus for the trip across the Channel. It was\r\nfine--a one-piece suit which came from the toes to the ears and a hood\r\nwhich you could turn in over your head! There was a painting of a\r\ntorpedoed passenger ship going up in flames, topside and the hull\r\nsettling down into the rolling billows. Men and women were jumping into\r\nthe sea and drowning in agony. They had no life-saving, one-piece suits.\r\nBut all were not so thoughtless. There were others floating along high\r\nout of water with the most beatific expressions on their faces. They had\r\nbeen thoughtful enough to buy one of the patent one-piece suits. The\r\npainting was in colors, red and black mostly.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon had closed in showers, and when we made the steamer\r\nlanding we stood in pools of water in the hollows of the worn stone\r\nflags. We were in good time, but a hundred or more who had been in\r\nbetter time were already inside the shed. The hold-overs from three days\r\nwere there, military people mostly. We waited--and waited--and waited.\r\nIt was the eternal passport matter. One at a time they had to pass the\r\ntribunal inside. A pleasant-mannered young English soldier stood guard\r\nat the shed door. Every half-hour or so, at command of a voice from the\r\ninside, he would let another dozen or twenty slide by. When he did so,\r\nthose of us in the rear would hurry to fill the void, picking up our\r\nbaggage from our feet as we pushed on. I had hired a porter, an old man,\r\nto look after my 70-pound bag. He stood by patiently for two hours or\r\nso. Then, without warning, he ran off and did not come back. I had not\r\npaid him, so he must have grown very tired. After that, whenever I moved\r\nforward, I had to pick up my two bags myself--the other weighed 40\r\npounds. Sometimes I put the bags into a pool of water--sometimes I put\r\nmy feet.\r\n\r\nNot every one had to wait. An officer would be passed through\r\nimmediately, which did not please two enlisted men near me, just back\r\nfrom what they called rough work at the front. The little one, called\r\nScotty, had a fear that the boat might leave before he could get there.\r\nHe wanted to \"mak' a train oot o' Lunnon\" at two of the next afternoon,\r\n\"mak' a nicht train oot o' Glesgie\" (Glasgow) and surprise his folk by\r\nwalking in on 'em \"afore brekkist.\" They would be glad to see him, be\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n\"Almost as glad to see you come as they was goin'?\" asked the soldier\r\nwith him, and then urged Scotty to stop over in London for a bit o' fun.\r\n\r\n\"I'll not,\" said Scotty. \"I'll mak' the trains as I said an' surprise\r\n'em afore brekkist. Besides, there's a football match on for the\r\narternoon arter to-morrer, and an old pal o' mine is playin' for'ard for\r\noor team. But let 'em allow all these officers aboord first--'ere's\r\nanither ane--listen tae 'im!\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not an officer this time. It was a voice asking if any\r\nprivileges were accorded a King's messenger. The guard at the door said\r\ncertainly, but where was he? Everybody made way for the voice. He turned\r\nout to be a little man with a scraggy beard and large round spectacles.\r\nThe guard eyed him doubtfully. The King's messenger stood on his toes\r\nand whispered up into the guard's ear.\r\n\r\nThe guard looked down on him. \"King's messenger! Go on with yer!\" He\r\nshoved him back.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, garn with yer!\" said Scotty, \"but he's gained a guid half oor wi'\r\nhis King's-messenger talk. I think I'll hae tae be something important\r\nmasel' sune.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldier with Scotty could speak French. He spoke it to a pretty\r\nyoung French girl and her mother who had been pressed up against them.\r\nThe mother had a new hat in a big paper box. Whenever the rush\r\nthreatened to crush the hat-box, she would hold it high over her head\r\ntill she could hold it no longer, when she let it get crushed.\r\n\r\nWhenever the girl spoke to the other soldier Scotty would want to know\r\nwhat she said. \"She's sairtainly pretty. What did she say that time,\r\nTid?\"\r\n\r\nTid kept to himself what she said. \"It's a cut above the likes of you\r\nwe're discussin',\" said Tid.\r\n\r\n\"She'll be goin' to England to marry an English officer,\" said Scotty.\r\n\r\nThe girl whirled on him. \"No. No Engleesh officier--a French officier!\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a notion you'd spoil it,\" said Tid.\r\n\r\n\"Ma Gud,\" groaned Scotty. \"I wonder, Tid, did she hear a' I said this\r\nnicht o' her, and ma lips no two feet frae her ear!\"\r\n\r\nThe night was growing cooler. The girl's fur neck-piece slipped down\r\nfrom her shoulders. The mother had passed her the hat-box, and the girl\r\nhad no hand free for the neck-piece. Scotty put it back for her. She\r\nthanked him sweetly.\r\n\r\n\"You're no mad noo?\" said Scotty. \"I'll tak' a steady billet tae put it\r\nback.\" He took to slyly stroking the fur piece when he thought she could\r\nnot see him.\r\n\r\nA woman lost her passport, but did not know it until she was about to be\r\npassed through the door. Then she shrieked. She came back in the crowd\r\nto look for it. She had been standing in one spot for an hour--it must\r\nbe there. She rushed to the spot, lit a match, and began to look under\r\nher feet. A man lit a match and began to look under his feet. Another\r\nman lit a match and began to look under his feet. We all lit matches and\r\nbegan to look under our feet.\r\n\r\nShe shrieked again. \"Ma Gud, she's a dyin' woman!\" said Scotty.\r\n\r\nShe was not. She had found her passport. The business of waiting was\r\nresumed by the rest of us.\r\n\r\nThe little cafés along the water-front were closing; loads of soldiers\r\nand sailors began to flow out on to the jetty. One began to sing, and\r\nanother; others to whirl along in grotesque dance steps. Two began to\r\ntalk loudly. They came to blows. A third one stepped in to stop it,\r\nwhereupon one of the first two turned on him to inquire what he was\r\ninterfering for.\r\n\r\n\"But he's a friend o' mine,\" explained the third man.\r\n\r\n\"Is he a better friend o' yours than o' me? Answer me that. Is he? Do\r\nyou know him longer than I know him? No? Then mind your own and do not\r\nbe interferin'.\" The third man felt properly rebuked. He withdrew his\r\nobjections and the other two resumed their fight.\r\n\r\nWe were inside the shed at last; and by and by I came before a man in a\r\nlittle office inside the shed. He was a Frenchman, but spoke good\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\"Your passport, please.\"\r\n\r\nI produced it. He took a look and passed it back.\r\n\r\n\"Any gold on your person?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty dollars--American.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hand it over, please. Wait. Are you American?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case keep it. That is all. Pass out. Next.\"\r\n\r\nNext came a little house with a row of men sitting at a long, narrow\r\npine-board table. The first had a quick look at my passport and handed\r\nit on to a man who sat on his left before a card index in boxes. That\r\none dug into his boxes, found what he was looking for, and slid the\r\npassport along to the next on his left, who slid it along to the man on\r\nhis left, and he to the man on his left, and he to the last one.\r\n\r\nYou chased that passport down the line, answering the questions which\r\neach one put in turn, as to where you last came from, where before that,\r\nand before that, and the date, your business, where you were going in\r\nEngland, why, for how long, and where you would stay. They were all\r\npleasantly put, but you had the feeling that let you stumble and it\r\nwould be God help you. Each asked a question or two that nobody else had\r\nthought of. The last one had the least of all to say. He probably\r\nthought that if, after all, you were a German spy, you had earned your\r\nexemption. He only made a note of your name, handed out a red card, said\r\nto give it to the soldier at the out-going door, claim your baggage,\r\nhave the customs inspector pass it, and go aboard the steamer when you\r\nliked. All I saw liked to go aboard at once.\r\n\r\nThere was a man of many buttons behind a shining brass grill on the\r\nsteamer--French, apparently, but also speaking plain English. I handed\r\nin my ticket and asked for a berth. He was snappy. \"Have you one\r\nreserved?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no. When I bought my steamer ticket I was told that there would be\r\nno need to reserve a berth--there would be plenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"He told you wrong. There are no berths.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is he not your agent--the man who sold me the ticket?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you accept his ticket?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no berth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that I pay for a first-class ticket on your steamer and then\r\nhave to walk the deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no berth, I say.\" He talked like a machine-gun, and the marble\r\nRoman gods were not more impassive as he turned to the next. I saluted\r\nhim. You just have to honor a man who knows exactly what he wants to say\r\nand says it, which did not prevent me from saying over the next one's\r\nshoulder what I thought of his manners, the ethics of his company, and\r\nthe cheek of the well-known tourist agency which had sold me the ticket\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\nBut it did not get me anything. He went right on about his business of\r\nturning more people away.\r\n\r\nI had a look around. The smoking-room air was all blue, and all khaki as\r\nto chairs and tables. Also all khaki as to sleeping-quarters. They had\r\nbeen campaigning for a year or more on the western line, and had not\r\nlost any time here. And every blessed one of them had a whiskey and soda\r\nbefore him. They were talking, but not of the war. They were going home\r\nfor a ten days' leave after a year at the front and were trying to\r\nforget the war. There was also a lounge-room and a dining-saloon, but\r\nbunks there were also already commandeered by the strategic military.\r\n\r\nIt could be a worse night to walk the deck. To see what was doing a man\r\nwould want to walk the deck anyway.\r\n\r\nThere was a fine bright moon mounting above the housetops of the\r\nwater-front when we slid away from our jetty berth. Slid is the word.\r\nShe was all power, this Channel steamer of hardly 1,500 tons, yet with\r\ntwo great smoke-stacks, three propellers, turbine-engines, and burning\r\noil for fuel. That last is a cheerful item when you have to walk the\r\ndeck--it means no cinders in your eyes.\r\n\r\nFuss? A strange word to her. She slipped like running oil from the\r\njetty, past the breakwater lights, out by the few craft anchored\r\nthere--a fast one for sure. To get a line on her speed, you had but to\r\nwatch the shore marks fall away or the water slide by her side as out\r\ninto the Channel she went.\r\n\r\nPeople without berths, but with a chair and a rug from the head steward,\r\nbegan now to tuck away. At first they sat mostly by the rail watching\r\nthings. Later they sought snugger corners; but two o'clock of a\r\nSeptember morning in 50° north is still two o'clock in the morning. They\r\nbegan to go inside. The lights were turned off inside the ship, so when\r\nyou walked around in there and felt your foot come down on something\r\nsoft, you needed to tread lightly--that would be somebody's neck or\r\nstomach. There were life-rafts on the top deck, of a homelike sort of\r\nmodel, in the form of two benches with the air-tanks under the benches.\r\nIf anything happened to the ship, you could go floating off with all the\r\ncomforts of a seat on a bench in the park--if too many did not try to\r\nhave seats at the same time. It was a fine night for anybody to spot us,\r\nbut just as fine a night for us to spot them. And a ship cutting out\r\ndevious courses at twenty-one knots, or whatever she was logging--she is\r\nnot too easy to hit. To lay out for the ten and eleven knot cargo boats\r\nis more economical. Still, who knows? We paid tribute to the U-boats by\r\nmaking détours. All the big stars of the night were out, and by them we\r\ncould follow her shifting courses. But no harm; she had speed enough to\r\nsail the Channel sidewise and still bring us in by morning. The night\r\ngrew older and cooler. The last of the people who had paid toll to the\r\nsteward for a chair and rug went inside. Only one couple were left; and\r\nthey had not hired any chair. He was a young officer, and they sat under\r\nhis olive-drab blanket, on a life-raft bench athwartship. From there\r\nwithout moving they could get sidewise peeks at the climbing moon. At\r\nfive o'clock in the morning they were still sitting there, heads\r\ntogether and arms across each other's shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhen we grew tired of walking we sought little anchorages. By two\r\no'clock any man on deck could have had his pick of abandoned chairs, but\r\nthey were not good chairs--the extension part too short. One very young\r\nCanadian officer opened up his kit, made a bed and what lee he could of\r\nthe forward smoke-stack. A round smoke-stack makes a poor lee, but once\r\ntucked in he stuck, and was there in the morning when clear light came.\r\n\r\nThe moon went behind clouds, and from the clouds little cold showers of\r\nrain came peppering down. Heavier clouds came, and heavier squalls with\r\nrain; and a mean little cross sea began to make. Straight ahead, above\r\nthe little seas a light showed, and soon another--this a powerful one.\r\nWe were still going at a great clip. We might know it anew by the way\r\nthat big light jumped forward to meet us. Soon we had it off our bow,\r\nabeam, on our quarter; we were inshore.\r\n\r\nA destroyer came out to meet us and blinked a message from screened\r\nlights. More ships met us. We passed other ships--all kinds of ships, of\r\nwhich in detail a man must not write here.\r\n\r\nIn good time and in smooth waters we made our landing. There was another\r\nlong wait, the same passport grilling, but in a different way, and then\r\na fast train to London. A taxi then, a room, a shave and bath, clean\r\nlinen, and--oh boy!--the roast beef of old England and people you knew\r\nto talk to!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENSORS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore a visiting correspondent can do anything on the other side he has\r\nto report to a censor somewhere. In London the Chief Admiralty Censor\r\nwas a retired Royal Navy captain and a Sir Knight, but not wearing his\r\nuniform or parading his knighthood. He was quartered in an old dark\r\nbuilding where Nelson used to hang out in the days before Trafalgar.\r\nThere was a sign on the door:\r\n\r\n                          DON'T KNOCK. COME IN\r\n\r\nHe was a good sort, with not a sign about him of that swank which so\r\nmany of the military caste seem to think it necessary to adopt. He was\r\nperfectly willing to pass me on to our naval base and go right ahead\r\nwith my work; but he did not have charge of the naval base. There was an\r\nadmiral over there--not an American admiral--who had full charge of our\r\nwar-ships there. Without his permission not one of them could tie up to\r\na mooring in the harbor. I would have to get his permission even to\r\nvisit the base. My very human censor in London said he would cable to\r\nhim and let me know just as soon as word came.\r\n\r\nAwaiting the pleasure of the naval base dictator held me two weeks in\r\nLondon. While waiting I had a look over the city. It was during a period\r\nwhen the moon was ripe for air-raids. There were seven of them in nine\r\nnights. My business in life being to see things and then to write about\r\nthem, I walked the streets during two of them and viewed some of the\r\nothers from club and hotel windows.\r\n\r\nThe underground railway stations did a great business while the raids\r\nwere on; also bomb-proof basements. In a newspaper office, where I used\r\nto visit, were precise directions how to get to their bomb-proof cellar.\r\nAnd be sure to take the right one. They had two cellars, but only one\r\nwas bomb-proof. Shops in the expensive shopping districts had signs up,\r\nadvertising their bomb-proof cellars and inviting their patrons to make\r\nuse of them; but the trouble with the shops was that most air-raids took\r\nplace after they had shut up for the day.\r\n\r\nThere was a local regulation which said that when an air-raid was on any\r\nperson at all might knock at the door of any house he pleased and claim\r\nadmittance. If he were not admitted at once he could call a policeman,\r\nwho would have to see that he was admitted. We used to speculate on what\r\nwould happen if some hobo knocked at the front door of the town house of\r\nthe Duke of Westminster, say, and demanded of the butler in plush\r\nknee-breeches that he be let in.\r\n\r\nThe chief defense against the Goths was a barrage of guns mounted mostly\r\non the roofs of buildings. An expected air-raid would be announced by\r\npolicemen running through the streets on bicycles, on their chests and\r\nback were signs: AIR RAID ON. They also blew whistles.\r\n\r\nThe great search-lights would sweep the skies, and by and by there would\r\nbe a great banging of barrage guns. Bang, bang, bang--that would be the\r\ndefense guns. Boom! That would be a bomb. Bang, bang, bang, and Boo-oom!\r\nThe guns fired 3-inch shrapnel. Three miles into the air the shrapnel\r\nshells would go! And what goes up has to come down. The next thing would\r\nbe shrapnel showering into the streets. It seemed to me that I would\r\nrather take my chance with the bombs than with the shrapnel. A bomb came\r\ndown, exploded, and had done with it; but the shrapnel fell all over the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nYou could see the shrapnel shells bursting high in the air--a beautiful\r\nsight--twinkling like big yellow stars, and then fading out. They would\r\nlook more beautiful if only the pieces of them would stay up there after\r\nthey burst. I was in Oxford Circus one night when a hatful of shrapnel\r\nfell about 20 feet away. One piece was about 5 inches long. Imagine that\r\nfalling down from a height of 3 miles and hitting a fellow on the head.\r\nIt would go clear on down through to your toes. Before any American city\r\nis raided I hope some chemist will invent a barrage shell which will\r\ndissipate all its energy and substance in the bursting. Surely an\r\nairplane can be wrecked by concussion.\r\n\r\nAn Australian soldier and a girl were standing in a doorway near me\r\nwatching the shells burst. His was that common case--a soldier in London\r\non leave, speculating on where the shrapnel would fall, and becoming\r\npeeved as he thought of it. \"A hell of a place for a man to come on\r\nleave! I came here to get rest and quiet, and I run into this gory\r\nmess!\"\r\n\r\nWhile waiting the permission of the British authorities I learned that\r\nall a correspondent's troubles do not come from foreign censorship. An\r\nAmerican newsman had cabled over something which did not please one of\r\nour admirals then in London. Meeting that same admiral, I put in a word\r\nfor my trip to the naval base, thinking that he might warm up and hurry\r\nthings along for me. He warmed up, but on the side away from me. He\r\nrecounted the enormous villainy of that newsman, and in conclusion said:\r\n\"Perhaps, after all, the best way to do is not to allow you newspaper\r\nmen to send a word at all!\"\r\n\r\nSuch an air of finality! He spoke as though he owned the navy; also the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nOne now and again grows up like that. By taking care not to die, and in\r\nthe absence of plucking boards, they rise to be admirals. Then\r\nside-boys, the bosun's pipes, the 13 guns coming over the side--all this\r\nritual goes to their heads. They get to thinking after a while that the\r\nwhole business is a tribute to their genius, or valor, or something or\r\nother personal. Perhaps all this one needed was a little salve; but I\r\nthought it up to some writer to fire a shot across his bows. So I came\r\nback with: \"That's all very well, sir, about your not allowing a word to\r\nbe sent, but there may be another point of view. There are 110,000,000\r\npeople over in our country, and some of them may not look on our navy as\r\nthe sole property of its officers. They may want to know what that navy\r\nof theirs is doing over here. And perhaps no harm in telling them--or\r\nsome day they may decide to have no navy at all.\"\r\n\r\nImagination was not his long suit, so he had no card to follow with. But\r\nhe did glare.\r\n\r\nAfter two weeks of waiting I got word from my very human London censor\r\nthat I might leave for the naval base. I left from Euston Station during\r\nan air-raid. The station had been darkened hours earlier, and it was a\r\nnew kind of sport going around that big black place to locate the\r\ncloak-room, and after you got the cloak-room to identify your baggage\r\nfrom a big tumbled pile.\r\n\r\nI lit a cigar, and as I did a policeman jumped me for showing a light.\r\nStopping to light it under my hat, a tall, able woman, dragging a trunk\r\nby the strap, bowled into me. While we were in our compartments, the\r\ntrain all made up, there came a banging of barrage guns--bang, bang,\r\nbang--with now and then the boo-oom! of a bomb.\r\n\r\nWhile we were waiting there we heard the crash of shrapnel coming\r\nthrough the glass roof. By and by another bunch of shrapnel fell with a\r\nfine ringing of metal on the concrete platform alongside the train. No\r\nharm done. The raiders passed, the banging and the booming stopped; but\r\nthere was then no driver and stoker for the train. They had gone with\r\nthe second load of shrapnel, and we had to wait two hours while they dug\r\nup a new crew.\r\n\r\nAfter three and a half hours of deck-pacing on the steamer, and\r\ntwenty-two hours of sitting up straight in third-class wooden seats, I\r\nmade the naval base; and late at night though it was, there was a\r\nBritish naval officer at the hotel to let me know I was to report next\r\nmorning to the British admiral in charge.\r\n\r\nThis admiral had a reputation in London for having no use for newspaper\r\nmen. When this staff-officer asked me if I had heard of his admiral\r\nbefore, I told him what I heard in London. \"He eats 'em alive,\" I was\r\ntold by a big London journalist, and I repeated that now, of course\r\nwithout naming the journalist.\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think of that?\" asked this staff-officer.\r\n\r\n\"If he tries to eat me alive I hope he chokes,\" I answered to that. I\r\nfigured he would tell his chief that, but there had been so much\r\nboot-licking done by a couple of writers over there that, for the honor\r\nof the craft, I thought somebody ought to have a wallop at these press\r\ncrushers once in a while.\r\n\r\nThis admiral is worth a paragraph, because he was a type. He was a\r\ncapable man up to his limitations; a good executive, a devotee to duty;\r\nbut he should have lived before printing-presses were invented. Also he,\r\ntoo, lacked imagination.\r\n\r\nHe was a man who acted as if priding himself on his brusqueness of\r\nlanguage. He sat at his flat desk like a pagan image, never looked up,\r\nnever said aye, no, or go to the devil when I stepped in and wished him\r\n\"Good morning!\"\r\n\r\nI told him what I wanted. I wished to cruise with the American\r\ndestroyers in their U-boat operations.\r\n\r\nHis answer was a No! Bing! No, sir!\r\n\r\n\"Whoops!\" I said to myself. \"I've come more than 4,000 miles, with a\r\nfine expense account to _Collier's_, and I'm turned down before I get\r\ngoing.\"\r\n\r\nI spread before him my credentials--from the department and elsewhere. I\r\nspread before him a letter from Colonel Roosevelt, the same in his own\r\nhandwriting. In France I could have lost my passport and yet got along\r\non that letter. Batteries of inspectors used to sit up and come to life\r\nat the sight of a letter in the colonel's own handwriting.\r\n\r\nThis man did not turn his head to look at what I might have. All the\r\ncredentials in the world were going to have no influence with him. He\r\nrepeated his No, putting about seventeen n's in the No!\r\n\r\nThen, mildly, I told him that I thought I ought to have something more\r\nthan a No; that I should have a reason to go with the No. He intimated\r\nthat he didn't have to give reasons unless he wished to.\r\n\r\nI asked him why he should not wish to? Was it not right and fair that he\r\nshould give a reason? I had come more than 4,000 miles at great expense\r\nto _Collier's_, for one thing. For another--and this more\r\nimportant--there was an anxiety among Americans to know something of the\r\ndoings of our little destroyer flotilla. They had sailed out into the\r\nEast, been swallowed up in the mists of the Atlantic--that was the last\r\nwe had seen of them. They were the first of our forces to come in\r\ncontact with the enemy. Were they doing good work over here, or were\r\nthey tied up to a dock in some port and their officers and crews\r\nroistering ashore?\r\n\r\nStill he said No.\r\n\r\nThen I went on to tell him what I had told our own archaic type of\r\nadmiral in London--with additions: that it was possible that we had in\r\nthe United States a different idea of the navy from what the British\r\npublic held; that in our own country a lot of people held the notion\r\nthat the navy was not the property of the officers, not quite so much as\r\nit was the property of the people; and that holding that view, these\r\nsame people thought themselves entitled to know what that navy was doing\r\nto back their faith in it. And perhaps it was not the worst policy in\r\nthe world to tell them what that navy was doing.\r\n\r\nStill he said No.\r\n\r\nBut why?\r\n\r\nWell, for one thing (he was disintegrating a little), in the British\r\nservice they did not allow civilians of any kind to go to sea with their\r\nships in war time. That further--they allowed no reports of their work\r\nat sea to appear in the press.\r\n\r\nI pointed out that reports of fine deeds were, nevertheless, appearing\r\nin the press; that from the London dailies of the week past I had made\r\nclippings of such, and if he cared to see them I would show them to him.\r\n\r\n\"But we allow no civilians to go cruising with ships at sea in war time.\r\nAnd I will not establish a precedent now.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the old fetich--precedent. I thought of judges who used to hang\r\nmen on precedent. He surely had what is called the mediæval mind, with\r\napologies to that same mediæval age.\r\n\r\nI pointed out that conditions in our country and his were not the same.\r\nThat there were hundreds of thousands of officers and men in the British\r\nnavy; that those officers and men were regularly ashore on liberty or\r\nleave; that they gossiped, and that hundreds of thousands of officers\r\nand men gossiping could pass the word pretty far, especially in a\r\ncountry where there was not a single little hamlet more than 40 miles\r\nfrom tide-water. With us it was different. Our nearest Atlantic port was\r\n3,000 miles from this very naval base; and 3,000 miles farther to the\r\nPacific coast, with no hundreds of thousands of men on liberty ashore.\r\nIf men like myself were not allowed to tell them something, how were\r\nthey ever to learn what was doing?\r\n\r\nI wound up by telling him he was an autocrat; which disturbed his graven\r\nserenity. Autocrat and autocracy were not pleasant-sounding words just\r\nthen. He snapped his head up, and for the first time looked as if he\r\nmight be human.\r\n\r\n\"We have to be autocratic in war time,\" he barked.\r\n\r\n\"Not in everything,\" I barked back.\r\n\r\nThen, and not till then, did he soften. We had a little more\r\nconversation, and then he said he wanted that night to think over the\r\nunprecedented request. He would let me know next day.\r\n\r\nA perfect bigot; and yet there were worse than he. He dared to say what\r\nhe thought about the rights of his station. Some of his judgments may\r\nhave been childish, but his convictions were deep and honest. I\r\nrespected him, and later came to have almost a liking for him.\r\n\r\nI have expended many paragraphs in telling of this interview, but it is\r\nmeant to be more than a statement of one American correspondent. It is\r\nmeant to explain a point of view which Americans may find it hard work\r\nto understand. That admiral in charge of our naval base can be\r\nmultiplied all the world over. We have them in our own departments.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting the admiral's pleasure I had a look at the port. A fine\r\nharbor, a beautiful harbor, but disfigured now by big, ugly\r\nwar-buildings. The houses of the port set mostly up on terraces. There\r\nwere several streets, but only one real one in the place, and that ran\r\nalong the waterside. All the pubs of the port were naturally located on\r\nthis waterside street, and so no tired seafarer had to walk far to get a\r\ndrink. Not many of our fellows were to be seen on the streets in\r\ndaylight; but at night they were plentiful. A couple of movie theatres\r\ntook care of about three hundred of them; the rest walked the waterside\r\nstreet. There was a port order there that no sailor of ours could stay\r\nin a pub after eight in the evening, so at one minute past eight that\r\nwaterside street looked like a naval parade. For the rest the port\r\noffered little or nothing to tempt a man. It was as rainy a place as\r\never I was in, and the back streets were crowded with children playing.\r\nBarefooted, healthy children! If they had not been healthy the weather\r\nwould surely have killed them off. It was a most moral port, too; too\r\nmoral for some people, who thought to put a little life into the place\r\nby making nightly calls there, and made the nightly calls till a local\r\nclergyman protested from the altar, whereupon some muscular young\r\nChristians ran the visitors back aboard their train and out of the\r\nport's history.\r\n\r\nNext day the admiral gave me permission to make a cruise with our\r\ndestroyers. He seemed to be giving it in the same stubborn fashion that\r\nhe had at first refused it--as though he saw his duty in so doing. I was\r\ntold that he said he did not think much of my manners; which, of course,\r\nworried me.\r\n\r\nI knew quite a few officers in the navy who were commanding destroyers\r\nover there. Any one of them, known or unknown to me, was good enough for\r\nme as a skipper. No man not ready to take a chance puts in for command of\r\na destroyer over there; and no man not fit is given a command. But I took\r\npassage with one that I had cruised with before--the alert, resourceful\r\nkind with plenty of nerve. If anything should happen, I knew he would be\r\nthere with all his crew and his ship had.\r\n\r\nWhat happened while with him and at the naval base I have tried to tell\r\nas separate incidents when I can, in the chapters which follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE THEY DIDN'T GET\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were one of a group of American destroyers convoying a fleet of\r\ninbound British merchant steamers.\r\n\r\nThe messenger handed a radio in to the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"We are being shelled,\" said the radio; latitude and longitude followed,\r\nas did the name of the ship, _J. L. Luckenbach_. One of us knew her; an\r\nAmerican ship of 6,000 tons or so.\r\n\r\nAnother radio came: \"Shell burst in engine-room. Engineer crippled.\"\r\nS O S signals were no rare thing in those waters, but even so they were\r\nnever passed up as lacking interest; the skipper waited for action.\r\nPretty soon it came, a signal from the senior officer of our group. The\r\n352--let us give that as the number of our ship--was to proceed at once\r\nto the assistance of the _Luckenbach_.\r\n\r\nThe skipper's first act was to shake up the second watch-officer, who\r\nalso happened to be acting as chief engineer of the ship, and to pass\r\nhim the word to speed the ship up to twenty-five knots. We were steaming\r\nat the head of the convoy column at eighteen knots at the time. The\r\nfirst watch-officer, having finished his breakfast and a morning watch,\r\nwas just then taking a little nap on the port ward-room transom with his\r\nclothes and sea-boots still on. The active messenger shook him up too.\r\nThe two officers made the deck together, one buttoning his blouse over a\r\nheavy sweater, the other a sheepskin coat over his blouse.\r\n\r\nWord was sent to the _Luckenbach_ that we were on the way. Within three\r\nminutes the radio came back: \"Our steam is cut off. How soon can you get\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nUp through the speaking-tube came a voice just then to say that we were\r\nmaking twenty-five knots. At the same moment our executive officer, who\r\nalso happened to be the navigator, handed the skipper a slip of paper\r\nwith the course and distance to the _Luckenbach_, saying: \"That was at\r\nnine-fifteen.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then nine-seventeen. Down the tube to the engine-room went the\r\norder to make what speed she could. Also the skipper said: \"She ought to\r\nbe tearing off twenty-eight soon as she warms up. And she's how far now?\r\nEighty-two miles? Send this radio: 'Stick to it--will be with you within\r\nthree hours.'\"\r\n\r\nBy this time all hands had an idea of what was doing and all began to\r\nbrighten up. Men off watch, supposed to be asleep in their cots below,\r\nbegan to stroll up and have a look around decks. Some lingered near the\r\nwireless door, and every time the messenger passed they sort of stuck\r\ntheir ears up at him. He was a long-legged lad in rubber boots who took\r\nthe deck in big strides. His lips never opened, but his eyes talked. The\r\nmen turned from him with pleased expressions on their faces.\r\n\r\nThere was a little steel shelter built on to the chart house to port. It\r\nwas for the protection of the forward gun crew, who had to be ready for\r\naction at any minute. Men standing by for action and not getting it\r\nlegitimately, try to get it in some other way. So they used to burn up\r\ntheir spare energy in arguing. It did not matter what the argument was\r\nabout--the President, Roosevelt, the Kaiser, the world series--any\r\nsubject would do so long as it would grow into an argument. The rest of\r\nthe crew could hear them--threatening to bust each other's eyes out--clear\r\nto the skid deck sometimes. But now all quiet here, and soon they were\r\nedging out of their igloo and calling down to the fellows on the main\r\ndeck: \"That right about a ship being shelled by a sub? Yes. Well!\" They\r\nwent down to their shelter smiling at one another.\r\n\r\nShip's cooks, who rarely wander far from their cosey galley stoves,\r\nbegan to show on deck; ward-room stewards came out on deck; a gang\r\nblack-painting a tank hatch--they all slipped over to the rail and,\r\nleaning as far out as they could and not fall overboard, had long looks\r\nahead. And then they all turned to see what 352's smoke-stacks were\r\ndoing. There was great hope there.\r\n\r\nThe black smoke was getting blacker and heavier. They were sure feeding\r\nthe oil to her. The chief came up the engine-room ladder. An old petty\r\nofficer waylaid him. Doing well, was she, sir?--She was. Hem! About how\r\nwell, sir?--Damn' well. She was kicking out twenty-eight--twenty-eight\r\ngood--and picking up.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight and picking up? And the best she showed in her builders'\r\ntrial was twenty-nine-one! What d'y' know about her? Some little old\r\npacket, hah?\r\n\r\nIt was a fine day, the one fine day of the trip, a rarely fine day for\r\nthis part of the northern ocean at this time of year. It was cloudy, but\r\nit was calm. There was a long, easy swell on, but no sea to make her\r\ndive or pitch. The swell, when she got going in good shape, set her to\r\nswinging a little, but that did not hurt. A destroyer just naturally\r\nlikes to swing a little.\r\n\r\nSwinging along she went, rolling one rail down and then the other, but\r\nnot making it hard to stand almost anywhere around deck, except that\r\nwhen you went aft there was a drive of air that lifted you maybe a\r\nlittle faster than you started out to go. Swinging along she went, a\r\nlong, easy swing, carrying a long white swash to either side of her,\r\nvibrating a thousand to the minute on her fantail, streaming out a long\r\nwhite and pale-blue wake for as far as we could see, and just clear of\r\nher taffrail piling up the finest little hill of clear white boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine, they say, she was making, and still picking up. What!\r\nThirty? And a little more left in her? What d'y' know--some little baby,\r\nhah?\r\n\r\nAnother radio came to the bridge: \"A shell below our water-line.\r\nSettling, but still afloat and still fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good work. Stick to it,\" they said on the bridge, and wondered whether\r\nit was the skipper or the radio man who was framing the messages. He had\r\nthe dramatic instinct, whoever he was.\r\n\r\nPerhaps twenty minutes later came: \"Water in our engine-room.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then: \"Fire in our forehold, but will not surrender. Look for our\r\nboats.\"\r\n\r\nAnd: \"They are now shooting at our antennæ.\"\r\n\r\nRadios to the bridge are not posted up for the crew to gossip over, but\r\nthere was no keeping that last one under cover.\r\n\r\n\"Shelling their attenay? Well, the mortifying dogs! Whatever you do,\r\ndon't let 'em get your attenay, old bucket.\"\r\n\r\nOur thirty-knot clip was eating up the road. We were getting near the\r\nspot. The canvas caps came off the guns, and the gun crews were told to\r\nload and stand by. A chief gunner's mate was told to make ready his\r\ntorpedo-tubes. He was a famous torpedo-man. He would stay up all night\r\nwith an ailing gyro or hydrostatic piston and not even ask to sleep in\r\nnext morning for a reward, and he had a record of making nothing but\r\nhits at torpedo-practice. But he had been glum all the trip. He had\r\nstayed past the legal hour on liberty the last time in, and the shore\r\npatrol had come along and scooped him up. A court-martial was coming to\r\nhim and so he had been glum; but not now. He went around decks smiling,\r\nwith a little steel thing that looked like a wrist-bag but wasn't. It\r\nheld the keys to the magazines.\r\n\r\nPretty soon he had torpedo-tubes swinging inboard and outboard, and\r\nbetween every pair of tubes a man sitting up in an iron seat that looked\r\nlike the kind that goes with a McCormick reaper, which all helped the\r\ngunner's mate to feel better. He stopped ten seconds to tell the story\r\nof the new gun-crew man who was sent up the yard to the storekeeper for\r\na pair of spurs to ride the torpedo-tubes with.\r\n\r\nThere were four guns, one forward, one aft, and two in the waist. They\r\nhad been slushed down with vaseline to keep the salt-water rust off; now\r\nthey were swabbing the grease off. Grease on the outside of a gun does\r\nnot affect the shooting of the inside, but a gun ought naturally to look\r\nslick going into action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Our thirty-knot clip was eating up the road. We were\r\ngetting near the spot.]\r\n\r\nTrainers and pointers stood beside their loaded guns, and other members\r\nof the gun crew held up shells, the noses of the shells stuck into the\r\ndeck mat and the butts resting against the young chests of the gun crews\r\nas they stood in line. There was a nineteen-year-old lad who, when I\r\nknew him two years before, was doing boy's work in the Collier\r\nbookbindery. Now he was a gun-captain standing handy to his little pet\r\nand trying not to look too proud when he peeked up toward where I was.\r\n\r\nThe foretop reported smoke on the horizon ahead. That would be on the\r\n_Luckenbach_. And where she was the U-boat was. The forward gun was\r\ntrained a point to right of the smoke.\r\n\r\nOne senior watch-officer, now in the foretop, called down that he could\r\nnow see the ship. Smoke was coming out of her hull. Soon he reported\r\nshells splashing alongside of her. Those would be from the U-boat. Soon\r\nwe all could see the ship from the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe foretop then reported the U-boat. She was almost dead ahead. She\r\ncould not be seen from the bridge, but, directed by the foretop, the gun\r\nwas trained on the horizon dead ahead; 11,000 yards was the range. The\r\ngun was one of the latest type--only a 4-inch--but a great little gun\r\njust the same.\r\n\r\n\"Train and fire,\" said the skipper. Bo-o-m! it went, flame and smoke. We\r\ncould not see the splash from the bridge, nor could they in the foretop.\r\nIt probably dropped beyond the submarine, which soon we could see--a\r\npretty big fellow she looked with two guns. She had been shelling the ship\r\neven while we were running up, and as our first shot boomed out she let go\r\nanother shell. We expected her to send a couple our way--she probably\r\ncarried bigger guns than we did--but she did not; she let go another at\r\nthe steamer. \"Maybe at the antennæ,\" said a chief quartermaster  on the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nWe shortened our range. The gun was trained and ready for firing when a\r\nsea rolled up on us. The ocean was smooth enough, but the swell was\r\nstill on--a long swell of the kind that does not sputter, but walk right\r\nup and announce their arrival by arriving. This long blue swell rolled\r\nup to our bow.\r\n\r\nWe were doing thirty knots and at thirty knots a little ship doesn't\r\nneed a masthead sea to get action. We went into it head first. It came\r\nright on over our bow, over our foc'sle head, over the forward gun. The\r\nshield to the forward gun stood probably six feet above the foc'sle\r\ndeck. That wave rolled right over the gun-shield.\r\n\r\nThere was a C. P. O. standing quite close to the shield. He grabbed a\r\nvertical rod on the outside of the shield, and just managed to hook in\r\nthe fingers of one hand. The sea, all white and solid, rolled over the\r\ngun and the shield. The C. P. O. was swept off his feet, but he was a\r\nstubborn one and hung on. Behind him was the officer in charge of the\r\nfiring. When he saw that sea rolling up there was nothing near but the\r\nC. P. O., so he grabbed the C. P. O. with both hands around the waist.\r\nHe too was swept off his feet, but he hung on--to the C. P. O. They both\r\nfloated flat out on the white roller, and the white roller went smash-o!\r\nup against the chart house.\r\n\r\nThe chart house was just under the bridge, and the glass windows had\r\nbeen taken out from the bridge railing so that they would not be smashed\r\nby the concussion of the forward gun. We were leaning out of these open\r\nspaces, just getting ready to laugh at the people below when, swabbo! up\r\nthe side of the chart house and through the open spaces and into our\r\nopen mouths came the wash of the sea.\r\n\r\nAnother wave followed that one, but not quite so high. As soon as it\r\npassed the forward gun was trained and fired. We had been making great\r\nleaps ahead all this time--the range now was under 9,000 yards. The\r\nforetop reported it short.\r\n\r\nThe U-boat was still there. We still expected her to send one our way.\r\nBut nothing doing for us. She sent another shell toward the steamer. The\r\nsteamer had quit firing. No use. The U-boat had simply taken position\r\nbeyond range of the steamer's guns and leisurely as she pleased was\r\nshelling her. Our third shell landed close to the sub. And then down she\r\nwent and wasted no time at it. Before we could train and fire again she\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nThe sub, as we learned later, had landed fifteen shells into the steamer\r\nand wounded nine of her people, of whom three were of the bluejacket gun\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nOne young bluejacket had been hit twice. He was carrying a shell to the\r\ngun when he caught the second one--a piece of flying shell in his\r\nshoulder. He laid his own shell on the deck to see how about it, and got\r\nhit again; this time in what our navy calls the stern sheets. That made\r\nhim mad. He shook his fist toward the sub. \"No damn' German's going to\r\nhit me three times and get away with it.\" He grabbed his shell off the\r\ndeck and slammed it into the gun-breech. \"Hand it to 'em, Joe!\" he\r\nyelled to the gun-pointer. Joe did his best, but he didn't have the\r\ngun--the shot splashed where most of them had, about half a mile short\r\nof the sub.\r\n\r\nStill pouring the black smoke out of our funnels, we leaped toward the\r\n_Luckenbach_ and hailed her through the megaphone when we breasted her.\r\nShe hailed back that she had water in her afterhold and fire in her\r\nforehold, and gave us the number of her wounded. Two of the three\r\nwounded bluejackets were injured seriously. We could see them stretched\r\nout under the gun.\r\n\r\nWe were steaming around the _Luckenbach_ at twenty knots while we were\r\nhailing: this in case the sub took it in her head to pop up again and\r\ncatch us slowed down. We did slow down and stop when it came time to\r\nclear away a whale-boat and send it over to the steamer with our senior\r\nwatch-officer and the surgeon, with the needful surgical supplies.\r\n\r\nWe continued to steam circles around the steamer all the time they were\r\naboard, with our lookouts keeping eyes skinned for the U-boat. By her\r\nmanner of shelling the steamer after he had opened fire our skipper\r\njudged she was a tough one. She did show once while we were circling the\r\n_Luckenbach_. Her periscope popped up about a mile abeam of us. It may\r\nhave popped up again--it was getting to be a nice little choppy sea good\r\nfor sub work and no saying that it was not--but we only sighted it once,\r\nand then it did not linger.\r\n\r\nThe sea was growing lumpy when the whale-boat came bouncing back with\r\nour senior officer. It was right about the _Luckenbach_ having nine\r\ninjured, but all would get well. The doctor was looking after them. She\r\nwas a cotton steamer. The kid who had been hit twice was all right. He\r\nwas walking around deck with his cap over his port ear and proud as\r\nBilly-be-Damn'--three times wounded by German shell fire and got away\r\nwith it!\r\n\r\nThe fire in the forehold? Most of it was from two old mattresses--at\r\nleast that was all he found.\r\n\r\n\"Did you put the fire out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. The steamer's crew were too tired to do any more hustling\r\naround to put any fire out, so we got out a hose and put it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about that bulkhead?\" asked the skipper. \"He hailed that he didn't\r\nthink it would stand the strain of steaming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe so, sir, but I don't agree with him. I don't see how that\r\nbulkhead's going to cave in with all those bales of cotton jammed up\r\nagainst it. What the most of them over there are suffering from is the\r\nreaction from that three hours of shelling--everything was looking\r\npretty blue to them, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can he make steam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Their engineer has two ribs busted in and a piece of shrapnel\r\nin his neck and part of his foot shot away. But he's all right. He was\r\nlying down when I first saw him, cursing the Germans blue. Then he says:\r\n'Put me on my feet, men.' A couple of oilers put him on his feet. I\r\nthought he was going to give orders to make steam, but he only wanted to\r\nbe stood up so as he could curse the Germans a little better. Lying down\r\ninterfered with his wind. He rolled it out in one steady stream for ten\r\nminutes. He was an Italian, or maybe a Spaniard, and his English wasn't\r\nperfect, but he could talk like hell. He's all right. He'll get steam\r\nup, sir.\"\r\n\r\nBy and by they did make steam and begin to move on a course our skipper\r\nwigwagged to them. The skipper left the surgeon aboard, and at twenty\r\nknots the 352 steamed more circles around the steamer, all lookouts\r\nmeanwhile skinning their eyes afresh for signs of the sub. We could make\r\nout a lot of smoke on the southern horizon. It was the convoy we had\r\nleft in the morning. An hour later the _Luckenbach_ found her legs.\r\n\r\nOur cripple broke no records for speed, but she was making revolutions,\r\nand by five o'clock we rejoined the convoy with her alongside.\r\n\r\nSo here is an eight hours' log for the 352: At nine in the morning she\r\nwas responding to S O S-ing ninety miles away; at five in the afternoon\r\nwe had her tucked away for the night in the column.\r\n\r\nThe tall quartermaster came up on the bridge to stand his watch. We were\r\nin our regular position, at the head of the column at twenty knots. He\r\nlooked back at the fleet. \"There you are, Lucky Bag. They must have had\r\nyou checked up and counted in, a big ship and a three-million-dollar\r\ncargo, this morning, and here you are to-night--one they didn't get.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTOR TAKES CHARGE\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery American destroyer over here rates a young surgeon. What some of\r\nthese surgeons don't know about seagoing can be found in about six\r\nhundred pages of Knight's \"Modern Seamanship,\" but that does not matter\r\nmuch. Let them look after the casualties; there are capable young naval\r\nofficers to look after the seagoing end.\r\n\r\nMost of these young surgeons have a taste for adventure. If they had\r\nnot, they would not be over here. The 352 drew one, born and raised in a\r\nSouthern State. Before coming over here he had viewed the Atlantic once\r\nor twice from a distance, which did not quite content him. His ancestors\r\nmust have crossed that same Atlantic to get to America, and somewhere\r\nwithin him was a high-pitched string that vibrated to every thrill of\r\nthat same ocean now.\r\n\r\nHe used to speak of these things in the smoking-room of the King's Hotel\r\nhere, which is where every destroyer officer comes at least once between\r\ncruises to get a--cup of coffee. He would have liked to make a few sea\r\nvoyages when he was a little younger, but if a fellow is ever going to\r\namount to anything he has to settle down sometime and become a\r\nrespectable member of society--so his folks were always saying, and so\r\nhe took up medicine. He liked his profession. A doctor can do a heap of\r\ngood in a suffering world--especially if people will only let him. But\r\nso many people want a young doctor to be experienced before they ever\r\nwill call him in! \"Get experience,\" they say; and not a doggone one in a\r\ndozen'll ever give a fellow any chance to get the experience. \"What the\r\nmost of 'em want is for some one else to give us the experience.\" He did\r\nas well as the next young doctor, but at times he would grow almost\r\nmelancholy sitting before the smoking-room fire telling of his waiting\r\nfor business in his home town.\r\n\r\nHe was not at all melancholy by nature. He could keep the ward-room mess\r\nringing with darky stories on a quiet night in port. His messmates\r\ncalled him Doc; and when the ship was at sea they were all glad to see\r\nhim on the bridge studying things out. He had plenty of time for that.\r\nIn two cruises his only cases were one quartermaster, who got hove\r\nacross the bridge and broke his nose, and a gunner's mate who broke his\r\nleg by being bounced out of his bunk one windy night. They were a\r\ndisgustingly healthy lot, these destroyer crews.\r\n\r\nBut he felt pleased just to be out to sea. These high hills of moving\r\nwater sure did give a little ship heaps of action sometimes. He would\r\nwatch them from the bridge. He would watch the officer of the watch too,\r\nand the man at the wheel, and the lookouts with their eyes skinned for\r\nU-boats, and the signal quartermasters balanced on the flying bridge and\r\nsending their messages in a jumping sea-way. He would go down to the\r\nchart house with the navigator and stand by to pass him dividers and\r\nparallels. He would stop to sigh when he thought that if somebody had\r\nonly tipped him off in time he might have gone to Annapolis and right\r\nnow be a young naval officer dashing around on one of these same\r\ndestroyers. Still, being a surgeon on one of them wasn't too bad. If\r\nthey had a battle or anything, a ship's doctor wasn't going to be too\r\nfar away.\r\n\r\nIt was in his third cruise that the 352 got the S O S which resulted in\r\nthe rescue of the big steamer spoken of. There had been other S O S's--any\r\nnumber of them--but this time there was something doing for our young\r\ndoctor. When she signalled that nine of her people had been wounded by\r\nshell and shrapnel fire, and the 352's skipper ordered a deck officer and\r\na whale-boat away, he also told Doc to break out his medical gear and go\r\nalong. Doc already had his surgical gear ready; from the first word of\r\nthe shelling he had gone below, and now everything was laid out ready for\r\naction on the ward-room transom.\r\n\r\nOver to the ship they went, all hands in life-vests, and while the deck\r\nofficer of the 352 was cross-questioning the captain and engineer, and\r\nlooking around to see how much damage had been done and so on, Doc was\r\nrigging up an operating-table between the chart house and the chart deck\r\nrail, slinging the table in sort of hammock style so that when the ship\r\nrolled she would not roll his patients overboard.\r\n\r\nDoc was no mean little operator. The great danger to most of the wounded\r\nmen was of infection. One after the other, he had his cases up, asked\r\nabout four questions, had about four looks, and went to it. No knowing\r\nthat the U-boat might pop up again and try a few more shells, or that a\r\nbulkhead would not give way, or a boiler blow up when they tried to make\r\nsteam below. No knowing; no.\r\n\r\nUp they came to his swinging table, where Doc took a probe, poked into\r\nthe wound, wrapped cotton around the probe, soaked it in iodine, jabbed\r\nit in, twisted it around, swabbed it out, dressed it down, slapped the\r\npatient on the chest, said \"Next,\" and did it all over again.\r\n\r\n\"Next! You'd think it was a blessed barber's shop,\" Doc heard one of\r\nthem say. Only he was an officer--by the back of his head Doc knew\r\nit--some of them would have told him what they thought of his rapid-fire\r\naction. But it was no time for canoodling--it was war, and they were all\r\nrated as grown men and so able to stand a few little painful touches.\r\n\r\nOne terribly wounded patient gave him worry. On him Doc worked with\r\ngreat care. He was working on him, all the others being attended to,\r\nwhen the 352's deck officer came to say that he was going back to the\r\ndestroyer to report. \"The captain of this ship wants to abandon her,\"\r\nsaid the deck officer.\r\n\r\n\"Abandon ship and we will never be able to get this man I got here now\r\noff her--not in this sea, sir,\" said Doc. \"And if he's left alone for\r\ntwo hours, he'll sure die.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll signal what the skipper says.\" The officer went off with his crew\r\nin the whale-boat, leaving a hospital steward and a signal quartermaster\r\nto stay with the doctor.\r\n\r\nDoc was working away on his hard case when his quartermaster came to say\r\nthat the 352 had signalled that they were to stay aboard and that the\r\nsteamer was to get under way and steer a course south half east\r\nmagnetic.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, without looking up, said: \"All right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell the steamer's captain, sir?\"\r\n\r\nThis time Doc looked up. \"Why, of course, tell him. Why not? Why do you\r\nask me that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the ranking naval officer aboard here, sir. I take orders from\r\nyou now, sir.\"\r\n\r\nFor about four seconds Doc neglected his patient. That was so; so he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, tell the captain.\"\r\n\r\nThe quartermaster ran up the bridge ladder. Doc gazed over the\r\nchart-rail down to the deck, up and around on the ship. \"Doggone!\" he\r\nbreathed. \"I am the ranking--I'm the only naval officer present.\" Then\r\nhe shook his head and bent to his patient. He might have the rank, but\r\nthe last thing he was going to do was to butt in on any regular ship's\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe disabled ship went on to her new course, south half east magnetic,\r\nwith the destroyer steaming twenty-knot circles around her. And late in\r\nthe afternoon they made the convoy. By night she was tucked in the rear\r\nof twenty other ships, the doctor and his emergency staff still aboard.\r\nThey were to remain aboard until the steamer made port.\r\n\r\nThat same night something happened. On the steamer they did not know\r\njust what it was. They saw a column of white, a column of black--those\r\nwho happened to be looking--another column of white, from the big ship\r\nof the fleet. And then dark came. There were radios flying about, but\r\nthey were code messages and the radio man could not decode them because\r\nthe first thing the steamer captain had done that morning when it looked\r\nas though the U-boat was going to make them take to the boats was to\r\nheave the code-books overboard. In the morning they would know.\r\n\r\nMorning came, but with it not a ship in sight. Of twenty ships and a\r\ngroup of destroyers the night before, not one now. It was his\r\nsignal-officer who thought it out first. \"U-boats thick last night, sir,\r\nand the convoy must 'a' got orders to disperse or else change course,\"\r\nhe said to the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"That sounds like good dope to me too.\" He turned to the steamer's\r\ncaptain. \"Where were you bound, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Havre.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor could see nothing else but to proceed to Havre, and on a\r\nzigzag course. The old captain did not know about the zigzagging; he had\r\nnever done any zigzagging and did not know why he should now--besides,\r\nit mixed his reckoning all up.\r\n\r\nThe doctor said he would fix the zigzagging part of it, and, telling his\r\nhospital steward to have a special eye out for the very sick man, went\r\ninto the chart house and proceeded to explain the zigzagging stuff. He\r\npaused to recall all he had ever learned while elbowing the 352's\r\nnavigator over the chart-table; also the answers he had got to his\r\nquestions while so doing.\r\n\r\nYou steer 45 degrees off the course you really want to make for so many\r\nminutes and then you steer 90 degrees from that for the same number of\r\nminutes back toward the course you really want to make--see, so--and\r\nthat gives so many minutes to the good--see. That was one way.\r\n\r\n\"How many minutes?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\nDoc had to stop and think that over. \"Twice the square of the total\r\nminutes--no, no. Take twice the sum of the squares of the minutes on the\r\ntwo legs--and get the square root and then you have the hypothenuse of\r\nthe two sides of the triangle; that is, you have the number of minutes'\r\nsteaming you make good on your real course.\"\r\n\r\nThe old skipper knew nothing of square roots or hypothenuses or anything\r\nthat looked like 'em, and he had always laid his course out by compass\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Doc, and after a while laid out the zigzag courses in\r\ncompass points.\r\n\r\nThe old fellow did not quite like it, so all that day Doc alternated\r\nbetween his bad patient and the bridge to keep the skipper reassured\r\nabout the zigzagging. Also he urged the crew to have a special watch out\r\nfor U-boats.\r\n\r\nThat night Doc and the seasoned signal quartermaster stood alternate\r\nwatches on the bridge. Doc would take a nap; the quartermaster would\r\ntake a nap; between them they were figuring to keep a sort of official\r\nnavy lookout. There were ship's crew men on the lookout too, but the\r\nreaction from the shelling had set in. Doc used to find them asleep in\r\nthe bridge wings.\r\n\r\nJust before dawn of the second morning Doc saw a shadow looming on their\r\nstarboard bow. He had another look. It was another steamer--a big one.\r\nShe was drawing nearer. \"See that?\" he called to the man at the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"See what?\" sort of drowsed out the man at the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe trusty quartermaster from the 352 was getting a wink under the\r\nbridge-rail. Doc yelled to him, at the same time grabbing up the\r\nmegaphone and roaring into the night air: \"Where you-all going? Where\r\nthe devil you-all going? Can't you-all see where you're going? Keep\r\noff--keep off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't _you_ see where you're going?--keep off yourself.\"\r\n\r\nBy that time the signal quartermaster was awake and bounding across the\r\nbridge. He grabbed the wheel and began to spin it around. The ship's bow\r\nturned. Doc saw the big hulk go by him in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"Good work,\" said Doc. \"How'd you spot him so quick?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't spot him, sir. I don't see him yet. I went by the sound of his\r\nvoice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Special little angel perched up aloft to look out for Jack when at\r\nsea--\" sang Doc. \"I thought that was a nursery rhyme. Now I know it's\r\ntrue. Between you and me, quartermaster, we'll get this ship to port\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nThey finished that night and the next day without seeing anything or\r\nhaving anything happen. Nothing except the argument about the forward\r\ncompartment.\r\n\r\nAmong the shells which had come aboard the steamer was one which had\r\npunched a fine big hole in her bow. The ship's crew had put a plug there\r\nwhich worked all right till the ship took to rolling, which it did this\r\nday. The hole was just at the water-line. Before they knew anything\r\nabout it there was the plug gone and the water up to a man's knees in\r\nthe forward compartment. Doc said it should be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe old skipper wanted to know who was going to stop it. His crew? No,\r\nsir. He wouldn't ask any of 'em to go down there--besides, they wouldn't\r\ngo. They were all used up since the battle with the U-boat. It made no\r\ndifference if the ship sank. He'd had so much trouble that trip anyway\r\nthat he wasn't too sure he wouldn't just as soon see her sink. He wasn't\r\ntoo sure they wouldn't all be better off in the boats. The U-boat had\r\nordered them into the boats, and, only the destroyer had come along when\r\nit did, they would 'a' taken to the boats, and then they'd 'a' been\r\npicked up and no more watches or ships or holes in the for'ard\r\ncompartment to worry about.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left but for Doc to call for volunteers from among the\r\ngun crew. They were bluejackets, and their only complaint on the trip\r\nhad been that the U-boat's guns had outranged their guns. They\r\nvolunteered in a body--even the three wounded members. Doc took all the\r\nsound ones and went down into the forward compartment with a mattress\r\nand some scantling he found in the hold. The water was by then about up\r\nto the men's waists. It was hard, cold work, but they got it done--the\r\nmattress stuffed into the hole and the scantling shoring it up. It still\r\nleaked, but not much--a little auxiliary steam in there at intervals did\r\nnot quite keep her dried out, but it kept her head above water, so that\r\nwas all right. All that day she was a lone steamer plugging her halting\r\nway over a wide sea. Seven knots was her speed, and all hands tickled to\r\nbe making that because of weak places showing from time to time in her\r\nsteam department--damages by shell fire which they did not appreciate\r\nproperly at first.\r\n\r\nThey were nearing the coast of France. They would have to make a\r\nlandfall soon, and running without lights, as they were, made things\r\nhard, so the old skipper began to talk to Doc. If the doctor didn't\r\nmind, he would take full charge of the ship himself. She was a big ship\r\nwith a three-million-dollar cargo, and if anything happened her, the\r\nowners would naturally look to him, the master, for it.\r\n\r\nDoc thought it was a pretty cool way to wash out all record of what his\r\nlittle force had done, but he also recognized the old fellow's position.\r\n\"It sounds reasonable,\" said Doc, \"but I think you ought to give me an\r\nidea of what you're going to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's been no sun for a sight these two days, but we were here\"--he\r\nmade a new dot over an old one on the chart--\"and logging so many knots\r\nto-day noon we ought to be\"--he made another dot--\"about here now.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the tides?\"\r\n\r\n\"The tides? Oh, yes! Well, I don't know about the tides. You see, I\r\nnever made a port in France before.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a coast chart-book in the rack. Doc took it down and began to\r\nread it. He made regular trips down to see how his wounded patient was\r\ngetting on, but always hurried back to his coast chart-book. Interesting\r\nthings in chart-books--he used to read them aboard the destroyer.\r\n\r\nThat night the first mate came up on the bridge. Doc asked him what kind\r\nof a light he expected to pick up. The mate told him. Doc thought he was\r\nwrong, and said so.\r\n\r\nWell, that was the light the old man had said they would make. Where was\r\nhe now? Asleep, and Lord knows he needed it.\r\n\r\nDoc did not wake him up. He had argued enough with him, but he didn't\r\nthink the old man had allowed for the tides, and if anything happened\r\nthere would be no more arguments--he would just assert his rank and take\r\ncharge of the ship.\r\n\r\nDoc went below, gave his worst wounded patient a night potion and saw\r\nhim to sleep. He also went down to see the chief engineer, who had been\r\nwounded three times--once in the head. The Doc talked to him awhile--he\r\nwas inclined to rave--gave him a half-grain jolt of morphine and saw him\r\nto sleep. He told the signal quartermaster that he had better have a nap\r\nbefore he dropped in his tracks.\r\n\r\n\"But the night-watches, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll leave the night-watches to the ship's crew and Providence. The\r\nwatch may sleep on the job, but the Lord won't--at least I hope not.\r\nAnyway, I know I'm doggone tired,\" said Doc, and turned in.\r\n\r\nDoc could have slept longer--about twenty-four hours longer, he thought,\r\nwhen he found himself awake. It was a sort of grinding under the ship\r\nwhich had wakened him.\r\n\r\nBy his illuminated wrist-watch he saw that it was three o'clock--three\r\nin the afternoon, he hoped. But it wasn't. It was three in the morning.\r\nHe had been asleep two hours.\r\n\r\nHe went on deck just as his signal-officer came to tell him the ship was\r\nashore.\r\n\r\nDoc found the old man and the mate looking over charts under a\r\nhand-light in the chart house. \"I could 'a' bet we'd 'a' picked up that\r\nother light,\" the old man was saying.\r\n\r\n\"The bettin' part don't explain it,\" said the mate. \"A fine place to be\r\nhigh and dry and a U-boat come along in the morning and plunk us another\r\nfew shells between our livers and lights. I'm tired of keeping my mind\r\non U-boats.\"\r\n\r\nThat was when Doc horned in on the old skipper. \"I been pretty easy with\r\nyou-all. You ought to been twenty miles farther east. You listened to me\r\nand you-all would have been. Look here\"--he hauled down the chart-book\r\nand showed them. \"And now I'll take charge.\"\r\n\r\nIt was low tide when she ran on to the beach. With the flood-tide and\r\nthe engines kicking back they had her off at daylight. After that, with\r\nDoc on the bridge, everything seemed to go all right. The mate said he\r\nmust have come over the side with a medicine-chest full of horseshoes.\r\nBy eleven o'clock next morning they were taking on a pilot outside\r\nHavre.\r\n\r\nHavre is a regular French port with jetties leading down from the heart\r\nof the residential places almost. The people, seeing her coming, she\r\nbearing the evident marks of her late battle, crowded down to greet her.\r\nAbout five minutes was enough for her story to circulate. The bluejacket\r\ngun crew, being in uniform, caught their eyes first. They cheered them,\r\nthe brav' Américains. And then the wounded came. Oh, the pity! Three or\r\nfour of the wounded, who had all that day been cavorting around deck,\r\nsaw the dramatic values and assumed most languid poses. Oh, the great\r\npity! Whereat two more almost fainted.\r\n\r\nThe worst wounded one--there was no pretense about him--had to be\r\ncarried down the gang-plank. Doc went with him. Good nursing was what he\r\nneeded; and he was going to see that he got it.\r\n\r\nHe got it in the port hospital; and then Doc and his two assistants\r\nturned in and slept sixteen hours by Doc's illuminated wrist-watch.\r\n\r\nAfter cabling and getting his orders, Doc headed for his base. Their\r\njourney back by train and steamer--the two men in dungarees and\r\nlife-vests, and Doc in sea-boots and one of those sheepskin coats they\r\nwear on destroyers--was noteworthy but not seagoing, so it is passed up\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nDoc made his port. We met him in the King's Hotel smoke-room, and he\r\ntold us all about it. We had had it already from the quartermaster and\r\nthe hospital steward, but Doc was to have a little touch of his own.\r\n\r\n\"There she was, a little down by the head, but safe in port,\" concluded\r\nDoc; \"and while I was waiting for my orders I had a look around the\r\nplace. There was a little square there with little cafés all around the\r\nsquare, and I sat in front of one of them and had my coffee.\"\r\n\r\n\"So this was France,\" I kept saying to myself. All my life I had been\r\nreading more or less about France, and it used to be a sort of dream to\r\nme to be thinking I might some day get there. And there I was--only a\r\nlittle corner of France, but it was France, and a pretty sunny little\r\nplace after our week to sea.\r\n\r\n\"And while I sat there people came up and looked me over. I thought it\r\nwas my needing a shave, but it wasn't. I had my cap on, and by my cap\r\nthey knew me for the officer of the heroes of the ship. After a while\r\nthey came up and spoke to me. I didn't get quite what they were all\r\nsaying, but I was one brave man--we were all brave men, there was no\r\ndoubt about that part. When they all got through one little girl came up\r\nand gave me a bunch of flowers.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled out some kind of a faded flower and sighed. \"She was about\r\neight years old.\"\r\n\r\n\"No use talking,\" I said, \"it's a great life.\" And the quartermaster--he\r\nstood with his signal-flags sticking out under his armpit--said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, a great life if we don't weaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's there to weaken about? Something doing every doggone minute\r\nsince we left our ship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE 343 STAYS UP\r\n\r\n\r\nMost shore-going people, after a look at a fleet of our destroyers,\r\nwould not mark them high up for safe ships. They are too long and slim\r\nand floppety-like.\r\n\r\nBut no one can tell their officers and crews anything like that. They\r\nhave tried them out and know. You take a destroyer in a ninety-mile\r\nbreeze of wind, put her stern to it, give her five or six knots'\r\nheadway, and there she'll lay till the North Atlantic blows dry.\r\n\r\nAnd that is not their only quality. Speed, of course; but not that\r\neither. They have a way of staying up after being cut up. There was that\r\none which was of the first to cross over for the U-boat hunting game.\r\nOne dark night she was struck amidships by a 2,000-ton British\r\nsloop-of-war. In crowded quarters and steaming without lights those\r\nlittle collisions are bound to occur.\r\n\r\nThis one was hit amidships--bam!--and amidships is a bad place for a\r\ndestroyer to be hit--her big engine and boiler-room compartment lie\r\namidships.\r\n\r\nThis one of ours was hit so hard that nobody aboard ever thought she\r\nwould stay up. She did go down till her deck was flush with the water's\r\nedge, but there she stayed; and her crew, climbing back aboard, took a\r\nhawser from the sloop-of-war, which towed her back to port. She was a\r\nfine heartening sight coming in. If she could come back, why worry about\r\nminor mishaps?\r\n\r\nOne of them--the 343 say--had performed her duty, which was to see a\r\nsmall convoy to a point well on toward a large port, and was returning\r\nto the naval base.\r\n\r\nShe was in no great rush, and, it happening to be smooth water, which is\r\na rare thing up this way at this time of the year, she stopped for a\r\nlittle needed gun practice.\r\n\r\nThere was no more thought than usual of U-boats. Nobody would have been\r\nsurprised if one popped up--it was a coast where they had been regularly\r\noperating--but no one was particularly expecting one.\r\n\r\nDestroyers are bad medicine if you do not get to them quickly, and\r\nlately the U-boats seemed to care more to get merchant ships; but this\r\nday the lookouts were not loafing on their job on that account.\r\n\r\nThe 343 got through with her target practice, and, except for a few\r\ngunners' mates still coddling their pet guns, the crew were taking it\r\neasy around deck; and also, because of the smooth sea, the ship was\r\nmaking easy weather of it toward port.\r\n\r\nSeeing a periscope is oftentimes a matter of luck. When they stay up it\r\nis easy enough, but when they are porpoising, shooting it up for just a\r\nlook around, you have to be looking right at one. What they first saw on\r\nthe 343 was the wake of this torpedo, coming on at a forty-knot clip for\r\nthe waist of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the 343 was on the bridge at the time and saw the wake\r\nalmost with the cry of the lookout. The wake was then pretty handy to\r\nthe ship, and the torpedo itself would be fifty feet or so ahead of the\r\nwake.\r\n\r\nThere was no getting away from it then. The only hope was to take it\r\nsomewhere else than amidships. Engine and boiler compartments were\r\namidships. If it struck her there they might as well call it taps for\r\nall hands. So the commander put the wheel hard over--to take it on his\r\nquarter, where there was also a chance that it would pass under her.\r\n\r\nTorpedoes generally strike twelve to fifteen feet under water, but just\r\nbefore this one could make the 343 it broached--came to the surface of\r\nthe water--but without slacking her forty-knot speed. It was unusual and\r\nspectacular. The sun shone on the polished sides of her as she leaped\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\nShe struck the 343 above her water-line and pretty well aft. Those on\r\nher deck who saw her make that last leap out of water hoped for the\r\nbest, though waiting for the worst. But the resulting explosion was\r\nnothing tremendous--so officers and men say, and so adding a little more\r\ndata to U-boat history. The bark of one of their own little 4-inch guns\r\nwas more impressive. There was a flame and an up-shooting cloud of black\r\nsmoke, followed instantly by another explosion, that of their own depth\r\ncharges, of which there were two of 300 pounds each in the stern. Those\r\nwho had any thoughts about it at the time were sure that if the torpedo\r\ndid not get them the depth charges would.\r\n\r\nWhen they went to look they found that thirty-odd feet of the after end\r\nof their ship had been blown clean off. The torpedo had hit them on the\r\nport side, and the wreckage was hanging from the starboard quarter. Of\r\nthe after gun only the base was left; they never did see any of the rest\r\nof it. The gunner's mate, one of those men who love to keep a gun in\r\nshape, was swabbing it out at the time, and they never saw anything of\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\nThe chief petty officers' quarters were farthest aft on the 343. The\r\nafter bulkhead to their compartment was blown in, leaving the inside of\r\nthe ship open to sea and sun. Fourteen men were in there at the time,\r\nlounging around or in their bunks. Many of them were bruised and all\r\nwere shook up, but they all made the deck. They do not know how they\r\nmade it, but they did. The after hatchway to the deck was closed with\r\ntumbling wreckage, so they must have gone up the midship hatch.\r\n\r\nOne man taking a nap in the cot bunk farthest aft had a part of the\r\nbulkhead blown past him. It cut off a corner of his cot and broke one of\r\nhis legs, and blew him into the passageway in passing. Landing in the\r\npassageway he sprained his other ankle. He is not quite sure how he made\r\nthe deck without help, but he did make it, and he says he beat some of\r\nthem to it at that.\r\n\r\nThe man who was working on the after gun with the gunner's mate who was\r\nblown up, saw the shining torpedo leaping in the sun and heading\r\nstraight for his part of the ship. If he did not do something he knew he\r\nwas in for it, so he began to take long high leaps forward. The\r\nexplosion came while he was in the air on his third long high jump. All\r\nhe remembers happening to him after that was of an ocean of water\r\nflowing over him, and he not minding it at all. When he came to, the\r\ndoctor was looking him over for broken bones, but did not find any.\r\nAfter the doctor left him he sat up and said: \"I bet I've been as near\r\nto a torpedo exploding and getting away with it as anybody in the world,\r\nhah?\" And \"Yes,\" said one of his shipmates, \"and I bet you made a\r\nworld's record for three long high jumps, without a run, too. You sure\r\ndid travel, boy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over the two propeller shafts were still sticking out\r\nastern, one naked and shining in the sun; the other also shining and\r\nnaked, but with a propeller still in place on it. Spotting that, the\r\nskipper ordered the engines turned. To their delight the shaft revolved,\r\nthe ship began to move. No record-breaking pace, but--God love the\r\nbuilder of a good little ship--she was making revolutions. The wreckage\r\nhanging from her starboard quarter acted as a rudder, and so, instead of\r\ngoing straight ahead, she began to go round in circles.\r\n\r\nShe continued to make circles, and her officers and men stood to\r\nstations and waited for what next would happen. Destroyer people have it\r\nthat there are grades of U-boat commanders--some of nerve, some only\r\nordinary. The U-boat man with nerve enough to attack a destroyer is a\r\ngood one. He will bear watching; so what they expected was to see this\r\nU-boat come up and finish the job. If she did come up and at the right\r\nplace to get another torpedo in, then the 343 was in for a bad time. So\r\nthey waited, some thinking one thing, and some another, but all agreeing\r\nthat the odds were against them.\r\n\r\nThe U-boat did show again. They saw her conning-tower slipping through\r\nthe water at about 1,500 yards. The skipper of the 343 was ready in so\r\nfar as he could be ready with his poor little cripple. Crews were at gun\r\nstations, and that conning-tower had hardly got above the surface when\r\ntwo of the 343's guns cut loose at it. They got in four shots, the\r\nfourth one pretty handy. But no more. She submerged to the\r\ndiscouragement of one earnest gun-pointer. He leaned against the breech\r\nof his little 4-inch to say: \"One more and I'd 'ave got her. Bet you me\r\nnext month's pay that I get her if she shows for two shots again.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not show again, but her not showing did not end the 343's\r\ntroubles. They could steam in circles, but it was not getting them\r\nanywhere. A few miles away was one of the roughest shores in the world,\r\nthe kind where green seas piled up against rocky cliffs--and a tide that\r\nwas already setting them toward it. A bad enough place in any kind of\r\nweather, but with wind and sea making, and this time of year!\r\n\r\nIt was about two in the afternoon they were torpedoed. By dark they were\r\nbeing driven by the tide and white-capped seas to the shore. They had\r\none hope left. Their radio operator had managed to keep the radio gear\r\nin commission, and through all their troubles he had been sending out\r\nS O S calls, though not with too great hope that anybody would come in\r\ntime. The U-boats had been pretty active thereabout, and it was not on\r\nany main sea route. There was always the chance, of course, that some\r\nwar-ships would be somewhere near.\r\n\r\nFor one hour, two hours, three, four, five, six hours they drifted.\r\nTheir wireless kept going out of commission, and their radio operator\r\nkept patching it up and getting it going again. S O S--he never let up\r\nwith that call. It was midnight when a British mine-sweeper bore down\r\nand hailed. By then they could hear the high seas breaking on the rocks\r\nabeam. The Britisher got the word across the wind, and tried to pass a\r\nmessenger--a light line, that is--across to the 343. They did not make\r\nit. They tried again and again, but no use. The 343 was then within a\r\nfew hundred yards of the breakers.\r\n\r\nThe skipper of the Britisher then hailed that he would try to get a boat\r\nto them. They could hear him calling for volunteers to man the boat. He\r\ngot the volunteers, and without being able to see every detail of it in\r\nthe dark, the 343's people knew what was happening. They were making a\r\nlee of the trawler so as to get the boat over. But the boat was swashing\r\nin and out against the side of the ship--up on a sea and then bang! in\r\nagainst the side of the ship. Merely as a sporting proposition, their\r\nown lives not depending on it, the 343's people would have been praying\r\nfor that boat to get safely away.\r\n\r\nThe boat managed at last to get away from the side of the mine-sweeper,\r\nand in time, pitching down on the rollers, they made out to heave a line\r\naboard the 343. And on the deck of the 343 they were right there to grab\r\nit and bend it on to a hawser. Fine. Off went the mine-sweeper after she\r\nhad taken her boat aboard, tugging heartily. She tugged too heartily for\r\nthe length and size of the hawser. It parted.\r\n\r\nThey did it all over again--the lowering the boat in the rough sea, the\r\npassing the line, the bending on of the bigger line, the attempt to tow.\r\nAnd again it parted. Wouldn't that test men's faith in their good luck?\r\nThe 343 thought so. Once more tried it, and once more it parted, but\r\nthis time not parting until they were far enough off the beach to be\r\nsafe till daylight.\r\n\r\nAt daylight a British sloop-of-war came along with a real big hawser and\r\ngave them a real tow to our naval base. A group of us were steaming out\r\nwith a fleet of merchantmen to sea as she was being towed in. Our\r\nfellows would have liked to turn out to give her a little cheer, also to\r\ninquire into the details of her mishap, but we had to keep on going, and\r\nwait until our return to port after a cruise to have a look at her.\r\n\r\nShe was in dry dock when we got back to port, and the most\r\nsmashed-up-looking object that any of us had ever seen come in from sea.\r\nThe wonder was how she ever stayed up long enough to make port. That\r\ngaping after end open to sea and sky, and the bare propeller shaft\r\nsticking out from the insides of her--she sure did look like she needed\r\nnursing! They agreed that they were a lucky bunch to get her home.\r\n\r\nOne poor fellow was killed--a wonder there were not more--and all hands\r\nwere sorry for him; but tragedy and comedy so often bunk together, and\r\nmen who adventure are more apt to dwell on the humorous than the tragic\r\nside of things. There was that about the code-books. The instructions to\r\nall ships are to get rid of the code-books if there is ever any\r\nlikelihood of the enemy capturing the ship. The code-books are bound in\r\nthick lead covers. They are kept in a steel box, and altogether they\r\nweigh--I do not know, I never lifted them--but some say they weigh 150,\r\nsome say 200 pounds. After the 343 was torpedoed, an ensign grabbed up\r\nthe code-book chest, tossed it onto his shoulder, and waltzed out of the\r\nward-room passage and onto deck with it. You would think it was a\r\nfeather pillow he was dancing off with. When the danger of capture was\r\nover our young ensign hooked his fingers into the chest handles to waltz\r\nback with it. But nothing doing. It took two of them to carry it back,\r\nand they did not trip lightly down any passageway with it either,\r\nproving once again that there are times when a man is stronger than at\r\nother times.\r\n\r\nAfter the 343 made port the injured were handed over to the sick bay of\r\nthe flag-ship. There were two of them who must have been pretty handy to\r\nthe storm centre of the explosion. At least, it took two young surgeons\r\non the flag-ship all of one day to pick the gun-cotton out of their\r\nbacks.\r\n\r\nThere was another man. The doctors, when they came to look him over,\r\nfound the print of a perfect circle on the fleshiest part of his\r\nanatomy. It was so deeply pressed in that the blue and yellow flesh\r\nbulged out all around from it. The doctors said it must have been made\r\nby a wash-basin being blown against him as he ran up the ladder to the\r\ndeck. But the man himself knew better than that. \"Excuse me, doctor,\" he\r\nsaid, \"but it was nothing so light and soft as a wash-basin hit me. It\r\nwas something more solid and bigger than that. It was the water-cooler,\r\nand I didn't run up any ladder--I was blown up.\"\r\n\r\nThe destroyer people have great faith in the durability of their little\r\nships. They are slim-built, and not much thicker in the plates than\r\nseven pages of the Sunday paper--they know that, but maybe that is their\r\nsafety. There is no getting a fair wallop at them. They evade the issue.\r\nOne man compared them to a hot-water bottle. Try to swat a loaded\r\nhot-water bottle. And what happens? \"When you poke it in one place don't\r\nit bulge out in another to make up for it? Sure it does. And how do you\r\naccount for that other one we were talking about? A couple o' years\r\nago--the one that had her stern cut off so that the men in the after\r\ncompartment leaned out where the bulkhead had been, but wasn't then, and\r\nchinned themselves up to the deck from the outside? And how do you\r\naccount for her bouncing along at twenty knots or more in a gale of wind\r\nand a rough sea, and nothing happening them? Get shook up--yes. But they\r\ncome home, don't they? They sure do. Maybe it's luck, but also maybe\r\nit's the way they're thrown together--loose and limber-like.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever it is, they are dashing in and out over there on their job of\r\nconvoying merchant ships and hunting U-boats. They expect to get their\r\nbumps, and they do; but so long as they get an even break they are not\r\nkicking. The chart-house gang on the 343 say that they are satisfied\r\nthey get an even break all right. If she did not fill her little\r\nthree-straight that time then nobody ever did get any cards in the draw.\r\n\r\nThey were sticking a new stern onto the 343 when I left the naval base.\r\nWhen they get it well glued on she is going out again. Maybe that same\r\nU-boat--you can't always tell, some people have luck--maybe that same\r\nU-boat will come drifting her way again. And if they see her first--pass\r\nthe word for the gun crews!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARGO BOATS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have spoken earlier of meeting cargo boats--tramp steamers, we call\r\nthem at home--while crossing the Atlantic. In peace times a fellow would\r\nnaturally expect to see them here, or almost anywhere else on the wide\r\nocean; but to see them in these war days was to set a man wondering\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nWondering, because more than 90 per cent of U-boat sinkings are of ships\r\nof less than 12 knots' speed; which means that these rusty old junk\r\nheaps, wheezing along at maybe 9 or 10, but more likely at 7 or 8 knots,\r\nfurnish most of the sinkings. They surely must be having great old times\r\ngetting by the U-boats, and their captains and crews must surely have a\r\nview-point of their own!\r\n\r\nAt this naval base of which I have been writing, you could look almost\r\nany day and see 5, 10, or 20 of these cargo boats to moorings. And\r\nashore was a pub--there were other pubs, plenty of them--but to this one\r\nparticular pub came bunches of these cargo captains to forget things.\r\n(Without wishing to offend any prohibition advocate, I have to report\r\nthat knocking around the world a man cannot help noticing that men who\r\nface peril regularly do sometimes take a drink to ease off things.)\r\n\r\nA barmaid, answering to the name of Phyllis, presided over this pub, a\r\nblond, square-built, capable person, who had always about three or four\r\nof these captains standing on their heads. She was not without\r\nsentiment, but never letting sentiment interfere with business.\r\n\r\n\"Phyllis, my dear,\" a skipper would begin, and get about that far when\r\nshe--her right hand reaching for the bottle of Scotch and her left for\r\nthe soda--would be saying: \"The same, captain?\"--thereby choking off a\r\ngreat rush of words, and forwarding the business for which she drew one\r\npound ten a week.\r\n\r\nBefore a creature of that kind these cargo captains were bound to preen\r\nthemselves. They bought at frequent intervals, not at all like the ways\r\nof another group--not cargo captains--of whom one of our American\r\nwarrant officers said: \"You buy and buy and buy, and they drink and\r\ndrink and drink. It comes time for them to buy, and when it does they\r\nsubmerge, and don't come up for air.\"\r\n\r\nThese cargo skippers were always coming up for air. They would hunt a\r\nman three stories up in his room, wake him out of his sleep, and haul\r\nhim down-stairs to have just one more. Between drinks, after they got to\r\nknow a man pretty well, they would talk of their sea experiences; and,\r\nafter the fashion of all true adventurers, their talk was almost always\r\nof the humorous side of things.\r\n\r\nThere was a skipper there one morning who bid all hands, especially\r\nPhyllis, good-by. He was off to Alexandria. He would not be back for\r\nthree months--more likely five or six months. Phyllis pinned a flower in\r\nhis coat and off he went. From the pub window they saw him board his\r\nship, and an hour later saw her steam out of the harbor and to sea.\r\n\r\nThat was at ten in the morning. At five in the afternoon--the lights\r\nwere just being turned on--those in the pub who happened to be looking\r\nout of the window thought they saw this captain's ghost coming up the\r\nwaterside with his crew trailing behind him. The crew looked as if they\r\nhad dressed in a hurry and were scampering along to keep warm. But our\r\nskipper was wearing all he wore when he left the pub.\r\n\r\nHe drew nearer. It was no ghost. It was himself, even to the rose in his\r\ncoat. He hailed Phyllis. She was talking to another skipper. The other\r\nskipper turned to see who was butting in, and seeing who it was, said:\r\n\"To Egypt and back in seven hours--the quickest voyage ever I 'eard of!\"\r\nWhich comment so depressed the voyager that he refused to say anything\r\nabout what had happened, except that five miles outside of the harbor he\r\nhad been torpedoed, and they had to take to the boats in a hurry.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is by way of introducing the captain who commented on the\r\nquick voyage. A few mornings later I was up at the Admiralty House when\r\nhe came into the waiting-room, let himself carefully down into a\r\nmahogany chair, dropped his new soft gray hat into his lap, and looked\r\naround.\r\n\r\n\"A solemn place, ain't it? Would they 'ang a chap, d'y' think, if he was\r\nto 'ave a bit of a smoke for 'imself while waitin'?\"\r\n\r\nI said that I thought the fashion nowadays was to take a man out and\r\nstand him up against the wall and shoot him.\r\n\r\nHe was tall, heavily built, fresh-colored, with a way of seeming to\r\nreflect deeply before he replied to anything. By and by he said: \"Oh,\r\naye!\" and lit his cigarette, but had not taken the second puff when the\r\ndoorkeeper's feet sounded outside, at which sound he pinched the\r\ncigarette hurriedly by the neck, and looked around for somewhere to dump\r\nit. There was no ash-tray, and the table being bare mahogany, the floor\r\nall polished wood, the fireplace with no fire in it, so brassy and shiny\r\nthat to put anything there would be treason--he dropped the cigarette\r\ninto his hat.\r\n\r\nThe doorkeeper smelled something, but he wasn't one who looked on lowly\r\nthings when he walked, and so did not see the little spiral of smoke\r\ncurling up from the hat.\r\n\r\nMy seafarer was in a great stew. To sit there and watch him was to warm\r\nup to him. There he was, a man who regularly faced death by more ways\r\nthan one at sea, but now in deep fear that this shore-going flunky would\r\ncatch him smoking a surreptitious cigarette. He stared determinedly at\r\nevery place except at his hat until the doorkeeper had passed on.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked at his hat the cigarette had burned a hole in it. He\r\nviewed the hat sadly. \"No gainsayin' it, war is 'ell, ain't it? I paid\r\nfourteen bob for that 'at three days back in Cardiff.\"\r\n\r\nI went out to help him buy a new hat. Hat stores were scarce, but life\r\ndoes not end with hat stores; there were fleets of little places where a\r\nman could sit down and talk about more important things than hats.\r\n\r\nIn the hotel smoke-room after lunch there was no sugar for our coffee.\r\nHis sea-training began to show at once. \"The thing you 'ave to learn to\r\ndo at sea is to go on your own. Nobody doing much for a chap that 'e\r\ndon't do for hisself, is there?\" From his coat pocket he drew an\r\nenvelope which once held a letter from home--in place of the letter now\r\nwas sugar. \"Preparedness--'ere it is\"--and sweetened our coffee from the\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of his life at sea. \"I can't say that I like it--I can't say I\r\ndon't like it--but it was my life before the war and it 'as to be since.\r\nYou've seen my ship, 'aven't you, lying to moorings? Nothing great to\r\nlook at, is she? but the managing director of our company--he has the\r\n'andling of maybe a 'undred more like her--'Let 'em 'ave their grand\r\npassenger ships,' 'e says, 'but give me my cargo boats that pays for\r\ntheirselves every two voyages.' The right idea 'e 'ad, I'll say for 'im.\r\nAnd for my part of it there is no everlastin' polishin' o' brahss and\r\npainting o' white work and no buying o' gold-laced uniforms at your own\r\ncost. And there's the bonus for me. Oh, aye! A bit of bonus ain't a bit\r\nof 'arm, you know, especially when you've a wife that's no eyesore to\r\nlook at, and little kiddies growin' up.\r\n\r\n\"Torpedoed? Oh, aye. It's not to be expected of a man to escape that\r\nthese days. My chum Bob, remember 'im--that was seven hours to Alexandria\r\nand back--with a rose in his coat? His fourth time torpedoed, that was.\r\nI've been blowed up only three times myself. Nothing much of anything\r\nspecial, the last time and the time before that--a matter of getting into\r\nboats and by and by being picked up--no more than that--no. But the first\r\ntime--maybe it was a novelty-like then. 'Owever, I'd carried a load of\r\ncoal to Naples and getting twenty-two pounds a ton for coal that cost two\r\npound ten in Cardiff maybe makes it a bit clearer what the managing\r\ndirector 'ad in mind when 'e said: 'let 'em have their grand passenger\r\nships, but give me my little cargo boats.'\r\n\r\n\"From Naples I go on to Piræus in Greece, and we take a load on\r\nthere--admiralty stuff, and not to be spoken of--and we put out for\r\n'ome. She was a good old single-crew, this one o' mine. Twenty-five year\r\nold--not the worst, though I'd seen better. Well warmed up she could\r\nsqueeze out eight knots, or maybe eight and a 'alf. I 'ung close to the\r\nland along that Greek shore, for if anything should 'appen ther's no\r\nsense 'aving too long a row to the beach in boats.\r\n\r\n\"Very good. We're rollin' along one morning when the radio man came in\r\nwith a message which read: 'PUT INTO NEAREST PORT. U-BOATS.'\r\n\r\n\"And without ado we puts into a little place down at the 'eel of Italy,\r\nand that night I 'ad a 'ot barth an' a lovely long sleep in my brahss\r\nbed which the missus 'ad given me for Christmas the last time 'ome. And\r\na great pleasure it was, I say.\r\n\r\n\"Next mornin' we put to sea again, and next day after comes another\r\nradio, and it says: 'PUT INTO NEAREST PORT. U-BOATS.' And we put into\r\nMalta, and that night again I 'ad another 'ot barth and a fine sleep in\r\nmy brahss bed.\r\n\r\n\"We resume our voyage from Malta, and a two days later I gets another\r\nradio--more U-boats--and I puts into Algiers. Three times in one week\r\nthat made with me 'aving me 'ot barth and a fine sleep in me brahss\r\nbed--grand good luck, I say now, and said it then to the mate, adding to\r\nit: 'There's a signal station west of Gibraltar--wouldn't it be delightful\r\npassing that signal station to get the word to put back to Gib and stop\r\nthere for another night and I 'ave another 'ot barth and a lovely sleep\r\nin my four-poster bed.' But the mate 'e only says 'e didn't have no brahss\r\nbed aboard ship to sleep in, and he saved his 'ot barths, he did,'til he\r\ngot 'ome to enjoy 'em proper.\r\n\r\n\"Summer-time it was, and I likes to take my little siesta after\r\nlunch--just like the Dons theirselves, y' know--and I'm 'aving me siesta\r\nnext day after lunch when something woke me up. There's a shelf of books\r\non the wall o' my room--chart-books and the like--and when all at once I\r\nsee them pilin' down on top of me I say to myself: 'Somethin's 'appened.'\r\nAnd so it 'ad. The mate 'e sticks 'is 'ead in the door and says: 'We're\r\ntorpedoed, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"'There goes my bonus,' I says, and goes on deck.\r\n\r\n\"We carried a 3-inch gun in a little 'ouse aft, and there was the mate\r\nfiring at the U-boat, which was out of water and maybe two miles away.\r\nIt was one of those out-of-date guns the navy would have no more to do\r\nwith, and so they passes it on to us. New good guns would probably be\r\nwasted on us, and maybe that's true. None of us aboard ever fired a shot\r\nfrom the gory weapon till this day. The mate fired two shots at the\r\nU-boat, but 'e don't 'it anything. The U-boat fires two shots at us and\r\nshe 'its something. One of 'em pahsses through the chart house, and the\r\nother tears a nice little 'ole in 'er for'ard.\r\n\r\n\"That'll do for that gun practice,' I says.\r\n\r\n\"'Aren't you goin' to 'ave a go at 'em?' says the mate.\r\n\r\n\"'You can 'ave all the go at 'em you please,' I says, 'after we leave\r\nthe ship. Besides you there's 19 men and 4 Eurasians in this crew, and\r\nsome of 'em will maybe like to see 'ome again--I know I do!'\r\n\r\n\"We get into the boats, myself takin' along what was left of a second\r\ncase of Scotch, and good old pre-war Scotch it was, not the gory\r\ninfant's food they serve these days that a man 'as to take a tumblerful\r\nof to know 'e's 'aving a drink at all. I also took along three sofy\r\ncushions, hand-worked by the missus, with pink doves and cupids and the\r\nlike--rare lookin' they was. 'A man might's well be comfortable,' I\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n\"I 'ad a cook. 'If comfort's the word,' says the cook, 'I might's well\r\ntake along the wife's canary,' and 'e takes it along in a cage in one\r\n'and, and a bag of clothes in the other. 'E's in the boat when 'e thinks\r\nto go back for a package of seed 'e'd left for the canary on the shelf\r\nin the galley. 'Hurry up with your bird-seed,' I says, and as I do a\r\nshell comes along and explodes inside of 'er old frame somewheres, and\r\nthe cook says maybe 'e'll be gettin' along without the seed--the canary\r\nnot being what you'd call a 'eavy eater, anyway.\r\n\r\n\"The mate 'ad a cameraw, and when we're clear of the ship he would stand\r\nup and set the cameraw on the shoulders of a Eurasian fireman, and take\r\nshots of the ship between shells.\r\n\r\n\"In good time one last shell 'its 'er, and down she goes. The U-boat\r\nmoves off, and we see no more of 'er.\r\n\r\n\"It's a fine day and a lovely pink sunset, and there's a beautiful mild\r\nsirocco blowing off the African shore to make the 'ot night pleasant as\r\nwe approach it in the boats. A man could 'ardly arsk to be torpedoed\r\nunder more pleasant conditions, I say, and we continue to row toward the\r\nshore in 'igh 'opes. It's maybe two in the mornin' when we see the\r\nside-lights of a ship. She's bound east--a steamer--and we know she's a\r\nBritisher, because we're the only chaps carried lights in war zones at\r\nthat time. Carryin' lights at night o' course made us grand marks for\r\nthe U-boats, but there was no 'elp for it. A board o' trade regulation,\r\nthat was, and no gettin' away from what the board o' trade says. We had\r\nour choice of carryin' lights and losin' our ships, or not carryin'\r\nlights and losin' our jobs. So we lost our ships. After a year and a\r\n'alf of war some bright chap in the board said that maybe it would be a\r\ngood idea to change the regulation about carrying lights, and they did.\r\nAnd about time, we said.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the crew were for 'ailing the ship in the night. ''Ail 'ell!' I\r\nsays. 'D'y' think I want to be took into that rotten 'ole of a Port\r\nSaid, or maybe Alexandria, and that end of the Mediterranean fair lousy\r\nwith U-boats. Besides, we'll get 'ome quicker this way,' I says, and\r\nallows her to pass on. In the mornin' we run onto the beach, and 'ardly\r\nthere when a crowd of Ayrabs come gallopin' down on 'orseback to us.\r\n'We'll be killed now,' says the mate, and talks under his breath of\r\nstubborn captains, who wouldn't 'ail a friendly ship's light in the\r\ndark, but the only killing the Ayrabs do is two young goats for\r\nbreakfast. And they make coffee that was coffee, and we had a lovely\r\nmeal on the sand. And by and by they steered us along the shore to where\r\nwas a French destroyer, which takes us over to Gibraltar, and from Gib\r\nwe passed on through Spain and France to Havre. Three weeks that took,\r\nand I never 'ad such a three weeks in all my life. 'Eroes, ragin'\r\n'eroes--that's wot we were!\r\n\r\n\"At Havre the French authorities took the mate's pictures out of the\r\ncameraw, and they never did give 'em back. Except for that, it was a\r\nfine pleasure, that land cruise 'ome.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky? Oh, aye, you may well say it. Three times in one week I 'ad me\r\n'ot barth and my lovely sleep in me brahss bed--it's not to be looked\r\nfor with ordinary luck, you know.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne day the destroyer to which I was assigned put to sea. There were\r\nother destroyers, and we were to take a fleet of merchantmen from the\r\nnaval base to such and such a latitude and longitude, and there turn\r\nthem loose. My friend's ship was of the convoy.\r\n\r\nWe made such and such a latitude and longitude, and there we turned them\r\nloose, signalling the position to them and waiting for acknowledgment.\r\nThey acknowledged the signal. We then hoisted the three pennants which\r\neverywhere at sea means: Pleasant voyage! They answered with the three\r\npennants which everywhere spells: Thank you. And no sooner done than\r\naway they belted, each for himself, and let the U-boats get the\r\nhindmost.\r\n\r\nThe hindmost here was the rusty old cargo boat of my friend. I could see\r\nher for miles after the others were hull down; and long after I could\r\nsee her I could picture him--walking his lonely bridge and his ship\r\nplugging away at her 7 or maybe 7-1/2 knots across the lonely ocean.\r\n\r\nThree times torpedoed and taking it all as part of his work! Some day\r\nthey may get him and he not come back; and when they do the world will\r\nhear little about him. Hero? He a hero? Why a shore-going flunky had him\r\nbluffed for smoking a surreptitious cigarette in high quarters! 'Ero?\r\nNot 'im. Why 'e don't even wear a uniform.\r\n\r\nSo there they are, the wheezing old cargo boats and their officers and\r\ncrew. British, French, Italian, American, but mostly British.\r\n\r\nNo heroes, but the Lord help their people if they hadn't stayed on the\r\njob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOTILLA HUMOR--AT SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were a group of American destroyers convoying twenty home-bound\r\nBritish steamers. There was one ship, a _P. & O._ liner, a great\r\nspecimen of camouflaging.\r\n\r\nShe was the only ship in the convoy that was camouflaged, and she rode\r\nin stately style two lengths out in front of the others. All of which\r\nmade her a prominent object. Our officers felt like telling her to dress\r\nback; but she had a British commodore aboard, and for an American two or\r\nthree striper to try to advise a British commodore--well, it isn't done.\r\n\r\nAll day long she rode out in front of the column, and all day long our\r\nfellows kept saying things about her.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't she the chesty one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at the big squab with all that war-paint on--how does she expect\r\nany U-boat to overlook her?\"\r\n\r\n\"That big loafer, she'd better watch out or she'll be getting hers\r\nbefore the day's gone!\"\r\n\r\nU-boats were thick around there. One of them must have come up, looked\r\nthe convoy over, and said, \"Well, there's nothing to this but the big\r\none!\" and, Bing! let her have it, for it was not yet quite dark when\r\nthose who were looking at her saw a column like steam go into the air, a\r\nblack column like coal follow it, and after that a column of water\r\nboiling white.\r\n\r\nOne of our destroyers hopped to twenty-five knots, dumped over a\r\n300-pound \"ash-can,\" and got Mister U-boat. At least, the British\r\nadmiralty later gave her 100 per cent on the circumstantial evidence.\r\nTwo other destroyers--the 396 and the 384, we will call them--went at\r\nonce to the job of taking off passengers from the sinking ship.\r\n\r\nThat was at five minutes to six, just before dark. It had interrupted\r\ndinner on our ship; but by and by we went back to the ward-room to\r\nfinish eating. It is always good business to eat--no knowing when a man\r\nwill be needing a good meal to be standing by him inside. And we were\r\nstill eating when the messenger came in with a radio. He passed it to\r\nthe skipper, who read it to himself, whistled, and then read aloud:\r\nTORPEDOED--CLAN LINDSAY.\r\n\r\nThe _Clan Lindsay_ was another of our convoy, and she had been within\r\n1,000 yards of our ship when we last came about to zigzag back across\r\nthe front of our column.\r\n\r\nWe looked at one another, and one said: \"Well, you got to hand it to\r\nFritz for being on the job every minute.\"\r\n\r\nAnd another: \"Yes, but it looks like a big night to-night. Two in an\r\nhour! And eighteen more ships and eight destroyers to pick from yet! If\r\nhe starts off like that, what d'y' s'pose he'll be batting by morning?\"\r\n\r\nThe ward-room on our ship opens onto the ship's galley; and from the\r\nship's galley another door opens onto the deck. Through the open\r\ngalley-door just then came a muffled explosion--a great Woof!\r\n\r\nWe all thought just one thing--they've got us too!--and we all sort of\r\nhalf curled up, and would not have been a bit surprised if the next\r\ninstant we found ourselves sailing through the deck overhead. The\r\nfeeling lasted for perhaps three seconds, and then our skipper,\r\nhappening to look up, saw that the colored mess-boy George was grinning\r\nwidely.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil you laughing at?\" barked out our skipper.\r\n\r\nGeorge took his eyes off the galley-door, but his grin remained. Said\r\nGeorge: \"Cap'n, I see de flame. The galley stove just done bust!\"\r\n\r\nThe galley stove on our ship was an oil-burner. It had back-fired, and\r\nso the loud Woof!\r\n\r\nLater it came out that the _Clan Lindsay_ wasn't torpedoed at all; but\r\none of our destroyers dropped a depth charge so close to her to get a\r\nU-boat that she thought she was.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe camouflaged big liner sank, but not until the two of our destroyers\r\nstanding by had taken off every one of the 503 passengers, one taking\r\nthe people off the deck, the other picking up those in the small boats.\r\nOne destroyer--the 396, say--took off 307 of these passengers. Her\r\nskipper passed the word by radio to the 384, which had gathered in 196\r\npassengers, including the commodore. The 384 got the message, only she\r\ngot it 7 instead of 307 people rescued.\r\n\r\n\"Seven survivors!\" said the 384's skipper. \"I wonder why she radioed\r\nthat?\" He meditated over the puzzle and by and by solved it to his\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, what she wants is for us to take off the seven and add 'em\r\nto our own.\" He took measures to meet the emergency, and then followed\r\nthis little incident:\r\n\r\nAboard the 396 they were busy trying to find space for their 307\r\npassengers when a lookout heard a Putt! putt! putt! coming over the\r\nwater. The officer of the deck listened. Everybody on the bridge\r\nlistened. Putt! putt! putt! it came. The officer of the deck reported to\r\nthe skipper. The skipper wondered who it could be, when just then a\r\nradio message arrived: \"Am sending a boat--384.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sending a boat? What for?\" He meditated over that puzzle and then he\r\nsolved it--as he thought. \"Sure. That British commodore she picked up is\r\ncoming to see how the survivors aboard here are getting on. That's\r\nit\"--he turned to the watch-officer--\"you know how these Britishers are\r\nfor regulations. Even in the midst of a mess like this we'll have to\r\nkotow to his rank or he'll probably be reporting us. So rouse out six\r\nside-boys, line 'em up, rig up the port ladder, have the bugler stand by\r\nfor ta-ra-rums and all that stuff.\"\r\n\r\nThey did that, shoving their crowded survivors out of the way to make\r\nroom for the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe Putt! putt! putt! comes nearer and nearer. Next, from out of the\r\nblackness of the ocean they make out a little motor-dory. Balanced out\r\non the gunwale of the little dory, when it comes nearer, they see an\r\nAmerican bluejacket smoking a cigarette. No one else was in the dory.\r\n\r\nThe dory ran alongside. It was about a 14-foot dory--no smaller one in\r\nthe flotilla. The skipper of the 396 looked down at him. \"What you\r\nwant?\"\r\n\r\nThe bluejacket removed the cigarette from his lips. \"I'm from the 384,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, but what do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've come, sir\"--he waved his cigarette-stub airily--\"to take off the\r\nsurvivors. The captain thought I might be able to make one load of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the big _P. & O._ liner reported herself torpedoed that evening, a\r\ndestroyer--not one of ours--picked up the message 100 miles or so away;\r\nand at once radioed: COMING TO YOUR ASSISTANCE--GIVE POSITION,\r\nCOURSE, AND SPEED.\r\n\r\nThat was proper and well-intentioned, but as the 384 and the 396 were\r\nalready standing by, a radio was sent back: EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT--NO\r\nHELP NEEDED--THANK YOU.\r\n\r\nThat did not seem to satisfy the inquirer. WOULD LIKE TO HELP--GIVE\r\nPOSITION, SPEED, AND COURSE.\r\n\r\nEverybody being busy, nobody bothered to answer that. By and by came\r\nanother radio: THIS IS THE DESTROYER BLANK--GIVE POSITION, SPEED,\r\nAND COURSE.\r\n\r\nHe was so evidently one of those Johnnies who are always volunteering to\r\ndo things not needful to be done that nobody paid any further attention\r\nto him. But he kept right on sending radios. By and by, for perhaps the\r\nseventh time, came: THIS IS THE DESTROYER BLANK--PLEASE GIVE\r\nPOSITION, SPEED, AND COURSE OF TORPEDOED SHIP.\r\n\r\nAt which some one--nobody seemed to know who, but possibly some\r\nundistinguished enlisted radio man whose ears were becoming\r\nwearied--sparked out into the night: POSITION OF TORPEDOED SHIP? BETWEEN\r\nTWO DESTROYERS. HER SPEED? ABOUT FOUR FEET AN HOUR. HER COURSE? TOWARD\r\nTHE BOTTOM OF THE ATLANTIC.\r\n\r\nNobody ever found who sent that message; nobody inquired too closely;\r\nbut all hands thanked him. The flotilla heard no more from the\r\nbothersome destroyer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe business of hunting U-boats is a grim one. The officers and men\r\nengaged in it do not like to dwell on the hard side of it. They do like\r\nto repeat stories of the humorous side of it.\r\n\r\nOne of our destroyer commanders over there has a personality that the\r\nothers like to hang stories onto. He is a quick-thinking, quick-acting\r\nman named--well, say Lanahan. He was one day on the bridge of his ship\r\nwhen the lookout shouted: \"Periscope!\"\r\n\r\n\"Charge her!\" yelled out Lanahan.\r\n\r\nAway they went hooked-up for the periscope, which everybody could now\r\nsee--about 200 yards ahead.\r\n\r\n\"He's a nervy one--see her stay up!\" said the officer of the deck, who\r\nwas standing beside the wheel, and had glasses on the periscope. And\r\nthen, hurriedly: \"I don't like the looks of her, captain--it looks like\r\na phony periscope to me--as if there was a mine under it!\"\r\n\r\n\"To hell with her--ram her anyway!\" snapped Lanahan.\r\n\r\nThe deck officer had not once taken the glasses off the periscope.\r\nSuddenly he let drop his glasses, grabbed the wheel and pulled it hard\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\nLanahan had stepped to the wing of the bridge and was leaning far out to\r\nget a glimpse of the U-boat. What he saw beneath him as his ship scraped\r\nby was not a U-boat, but a great white mine. He watched it slide safely\r\npast the bridge, past his quarter, past his stern. Then, turning around,\r\nhe said gravely to his deck officer:\r\n\r\n\"You're right--it _was_ a mine.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was another young officer--Chisholm call him--who played poker\r\noccasionally. He commanded a _flivver_, which is the service name for\r\nthe smaller class of destroyers, the 750-ton ones.\r\n\r\nIn our navy there are plenty of young officers who will tell you that\r\nthey never built destroyers which keep the sea better than that same\r\nlittle flivver class. Young Captain Chisholm of the 323 was one.\r\n\r\nOne morning, having convoyed a fleet of merchant ships safely up the\r\nchannel, the 323 was one of a group of destroyers making the best of\r\ntheir way to their base port. Officers and men who have been hunting\r\nU-boats for a week or so do not like to linger along the road home; so\r\nit was every young captain giving his ship all the steam she could stand\r\nand let her belt.\r\n\r\nIt was breaking white water all around when they started. It grew\r\nrougher. Chisholm in the 323 was going along at twenty knots when a\r\npoker-playing chum came along in his big 1,000-ton destroyer. Her nose\r\nhauled up on the quarter of the 323; up to her beam; up to her bridge.\r\nAs he passed the 323--and he passed quite close to let all hands view\r\nthe passing--the poker-playing friend leaned out and megaphoned across:\r\n\r\n\"What you making, Chiz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty knots!\" hailed back Chisholm.\r\n\r\n\"I am seeing your twenty knots and raising you five!\" returned the\r\nother, and passed on.\r\n\r\n\"The boiler-riveted nerve of him!\" gasped Chiz. \"But let him wait!\"\r\n\r\nThe sea grew yet rougher. The 323 was bouncing pretty lively, but\r\nhanging onto her twenty knots. \"And at twenty you let her hang if she\r\nrolls her crow's nest under!\" said Chisholm to his watch-officer, \"and\r\nI'll betcher we won't be acting rudder to this bunch going into port!\"\r\n\r\nIt was at ten in the morning that the big one had passed them. It was\r\nfour in the afternoon, and the 323 was still going along at twenty knots\r\nwhen from out of the drizzle ahead her bridge made out the stern and\r\nfunnels of a destroyer. It was Chiz's poker-playing chum, and his ship\r\nwas making heavy weather of it. The able little 323 came up to her\r\nstern; breasted her waist, her bridge, and as he passed her (and he came\r\nquite close to let all hands view the passing), young Captain Chisholm\r\nleaned out from his bridge and roared through a long megaphone: \"I\r\n_call_ yuh!\"\r\n\r\nHe beat the big one fifty minutes into the naval base.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are two channels leading into the naval base port--call them West\r\nand East. This same Chisholm was one day headed for port in the usual\r\nhurry and was already well into the west channel when a signal was\r\nwhipped out from the signal hill. It was for his ship and it read: \"West\r\nChannel mined last night by U-boats. Proceed to sea and come in by East\r\nChannel.\"\r\n\r\nChiz did not proceed to sea. All the harbor men who were watching saw\r\nhim come straight on through the gap in the barrage, and safely on to\r\nhis mooring. Also all the harbor knew that next morning he had to report\r\nto the admiralty and explain.\r\n\r\nThe story of his explanation was not told by himself. But an officer\r\nfriend, a great admirer--call him Mac--had gone with him to the\r\nadmiralty. Here the next day Mac told the story in the smoke-room of the\r\nKing's Hotel:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Chiz went and--you know his courtly style--he has his cape over\r\nhis shoulders--and he salaams and says, 'Good morning, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"The old man looks up and says like ice: 'You got my signal yesterday\r\nafternoon?'\r\n\r\n\"'I did, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then why did you not turn back and come in by the other channel?'\r\n\r\n\"'Sir,' says Chiz, 'may I be allowed a few words?'\r\n\r\n\"'Very few. What have you to say?'\r\n\r\n\"'Sir,' says Chiz, 'I have been trained to believe that the one word a\r\nnaval officer should not know is fear. In our navy, sir, we reverence\r\nthe tradition of your own Admiral Nelson, who at the siege of Copenhagen\r\nput his glass to his blind eye and said: \"I see no signal to withdraw!\"\r\nand continued the fighting to a victory.'\r\n\r\n\"'Have you a blind eye, too?'\r\n\r\n\"'My sight is good, thanking you, sir, for inquiring, but in my own navy\r\nwe also have the tradition of Admiral Farragut, who at Mobile Bay said:\r\n\"Damn the torpedoes--go on!\" and his fleet went on to victory. And there\r\nwas Admiral Dewey, who said: \"Damn the mines!\" at Manilla, and went on\r\nto victory.'\r\n\r\n\"'What are you coming at?' roars the old man. 'Did you get my signal?'\r\n\r\n\"'I did, sir. And my first instinct--the instinct of all our naval\r\nofficers--is to obey all orders of our superiors, sir. But I was well\r\ninto that channel when I got the signal, sir. And as I have said, sir,\r\nmy first instinct was to obey orders. But also I stop and reflect, for I\r\nhave also been trained to believe that hasty judgments work many evils,\r\nsir, and I consider and find myself saying to my deck officer: \"This\r\nship, Mac, is 300 feet long, and under her stern there are two big\r\npropellers. If ever we turn this 300-foot ship in this channel with\r\nthose two propellers churning and there's any loose German mines around,\r\nthere won't be a blamed one of 'em she'll miss. But if I keep her\r\nstraight on, there's a chance. So hell's afire!\" I says to Mac--\"there's\r\nonly one thing for us to do now and that is to keep straight on!\" And I\r\nkept straight on, sir--and, I beg leave to report it now, sir--we made\r\nour mooring safely.'\r\n\r\n\"And that's all there was to that,\" concluded Mac.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence in the smoke-room when Mac had done, and then a\r\nvoice asked: \"If Chiz had gone to sea and come in by the other\r\nchannel--it was almost dark at the time--he would have been too late to\r\nmake the barrage, wouldn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He sure would,\" said Mac.\r\n\r\n\"Which would mean that he would be kept turning his wheels over outside\r\nthe net all night?\"\r\n\r\n\"He sure would.\"\r\n\r\n\"As it was, he got in in plenty of time for that little game up-stairs\r\nlast night?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was in a little game,\" admitted Mac.\r\n\r\nAnother silence, and then another voice: \"Well, poker or no poker,\r\nChiz's dope on that damn-the-torpedo stuff isn't the worst in the\r\nworld!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOTILLA HUMOR--ASHORE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incident reported in the previous chapter was not young Chisholm's\r\nfirst interview with the British admiral.\r\n\r\nMac went on to tell how when, after his first cruise, Chiz came to the\r\nnaval base to report. He had heard that the old fellow in charge\r\nbelieved that the Lord made the earth for admirals, especially British\r\nadmirals, but beyond that he knew nothing of his peculiarities.\r\n\r\nHowever, after his cruise, Chiz went whistling up the hill to report. By\r\nand by he was admitted to the presence of the admiral, who was seated at\r\na flat desk in the middle of the room, gazing straight ahead.\r\n\r\nThe old chap looked pretty frosty. Chiz waited a moment, then ventured a\r\ncheery \"Good morning, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe face at the desk did not even turn to look at him, but the thin lips\r\nalmost opened and a rasping voice said: \"Got anything to say to me?\"\r\n\r\nChiz was one of the sociable souls, and he would have liked to sit down\r\nand talk in an informal way of several little sea things that he thought\r\nwere fairly interesting. But he had not been asked even to sit down, and\r\nthe voice froze him. So, \"Why, no sir, nothing special to report,\" was\r\nall he could find to say.\r\n\r\n\"H-m. Nothing to say? Then why waste my time or your own? Might as well\r\nget out, hadn't you?\"\r\n\r\nChiz got out.\r\n\r\n\"An American lieutenant-commander in this place must rate about seven\r\nnumbers below a yellow dog,\" said Chiz to Mac when he came out.\r\n\r\nChiz had four days in port (Mac is still telling the story) after that\r\ncruise, and two days after his visit to the hill there was a\r\ncricket-match between a team from our flotilla and a team from theirs.\r\nThe idea was for all hands to forget rank for a while, get into the\r\ngame, and so cement the entente between the two nations.\r\n\r\nChiz was picked for one of our team, and you all know what a husky he\r\nis, and what he used to do with a baseball-bat. There aren't many who\r\never hit 'em any further or oftener than Chiz on the old Annapolis\r\nball-field. He was one of the first of our fellows to go to bat. He's\r\nstanding there--in the box, or whatever they call it, waiting for one to\r\nhis liking; and looking around the field wondering where he will place\r\nit when he gets one to his liking. And as he looks he spies his friend\r\nthe admiral, playing what we'd call left field. And just beyond the\r\nadmiral the ground sloped away for a hundred yards or so.\r\n\r\nChiz hefts his bat--and you know those cricket-bats, what they look like\r\nand how they feel after you've been used to meeting fast ones with a\r\nnarrow baseball-bat. They are wide and heavy and springy. Chiz doesn't\r\npay any attention to three or four balls that come along, except to fend\r\nthem away from the wicket with his wide cricket-bat. He knew what he\r\nwanted, and by and by he got one--one about knee-high with a little\r\nincurve to it. Chiz sets himself and swings and whale-O it goes, over\r\nthe old admiral's head and down the slope beyond.\r\n\r\nChiz makes all the runs the law allows--six, I think it is--and he's\r\nsitting resting on the wide part of his cricket-bat before the admiral\r\neven shows the top of his head over the hill with the ball. When he does\r\nand heaves it about half-way to the pitcher, or bowler, or whatever they\r\ncall him, he's out of breath.\r\n\r\nChiz sets himself for another one knee-high with an inshoot, and when he\r\ngets one he whales it again, and away trots the admiral on another hunt\r\ndown the hill. And Chiz makes six more runs before they even see the top\r\nof the admiral's head over the brow of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe third time, and the fourth time, Chiz sets for a knee-high one with\r\nan inshoot to it, and the third time and the fourth time he belts it\r\nover the old fellow's head and down the long slope. But on the fourth\r\ntime the old fellow doesn't throw the ball in. He walks in with it and\r\nhe calls in the high official umpires, or whoever they are in charge,\r\nand they have a conference, and the next thing they call the game off.\r\nBy this time, doubtless (so the word was passed), the American officers\r\nhave caught the idea of the game, and next time there would be a real\r\ngame and so on.\r\n\r\nBut there was no next game. However, next day Chiz puts out to sea, and\r\nwhen he's into port again he calls up on the hill as per instructions.\r\nAnd by and by he is passed again into the presence, who is sitting just\r\nas before at the flat desk in the middle of the room, and gazing\r\nstraight before him.\r\n\r\nThis time Chiz doesn't speak, not even to say; \"Good morning, sir.\" And\r\nthe graven image at the desk doesn't speak either, and there's a silence\r\nfor maybe a minute, and then the old fellow barks out: \"What are you\r\nstanding there for? You wish to see me?\" And Chiz barks out in his turn:\r\n\"No, sir, I don't wish to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not wish to see me? Then what are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chiz cracks out: \"I'm here because your orders compel me to be here,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n_Zowie!_--that straightened the old boy up. He took a look at Chiz, and\r\nhe says, after a while and almost pleasantly: \"Have a chair.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chiz has a chair, and they have a talk, and after that Chiz finds\r\nhim a lot easier to get along with. Chiz says now that the old fellow\r\nisn't such a terrible chap--not after you get onto his curves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we first came over (Mac is still speaking), most of the topsiders\r\nover here were strong for the entente stuff, and a good thing, too--why\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nOur fellows were mostly strong for it, too--two or three so strong that\r\nit was hard to tell whether they were Americans or something else--even\r\ntheir accents.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I say, most of the officers of our own over here were for\r\nit--most of them. But you can't rid everybody overnight of\r\nlong-inherited notions. There was one chap we used to meet, and he sure\r\nwas the most patronizing thing!\r\n\r\nNow, we know we haven't the biggest navy in the world, but as far as it\r\ngoes we think it is pretty good. As good as anybody's, man for man, and\r\nship for ship--but let that pass.\r\n\r\nThis chap, who never could see anything in our navy, came in here one\r\nday. He wasn't bad. He was just one of those naturally foolish ones who\r\nthought he was a little brighter than his company. The topsiders would\r\nbe working night and day to create good feeling, and he was the kind\r\nwould come along and break up the show--not exactly meaning to.\r\n\r\nThis was in the hotel bar here, where a bunch of us were easing off\r\nafter a hard cruise, when he comes along. He doesn't like the names of\r\nour destroyers. In his navy there was significance in the names they\r\ngave to a class of ships.\r\n\r\n\"Take _Viper_, _Adder_, _Moccasin_, and so on--they suggest things y'\r\nknow. Dangerous to meddle with and all that sort of thing, y' know. But\r\nyour people name your ships after men evidently--_David Jones_,\r\n_Conyngham_, _McDonough_. I say, who are they--Presidents or senators or\r\nthat sort, or what?\"\r\n\r\nLanahan was there--the hell-with-her-ram-her-anyway Lanahan--and we all\r\njust naturally turned him over to Lanahan, who had west-of-Ireland\r\nforebears, and never did believe in letting any Englishman put anything\r\nacross--nothing like that anyway.\r\n\r\n\"You never read much, I take it, of our history?\" says Lanahan.\r\n\r\n\"Your history? My dear chap, I had hard work keeping up with my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt. But you've heard of the American Revolution?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dessay I have--Oh, yes, I have!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you spoke of Jones. If you mean John Paul, then there was a naval\r\nfight one time in the North Sea--the _Serapis_ and the _Bonhomme\r\nRichard_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, old chap, I didn't mention John Paul Jones. _David Jones_ is the\r\nname of your destroyer out in the harbor now.\"\r\n\r\n\"David Jones? Let me see. Why, sure, David Jones was a New England\r\nparson who boarded around among the God-fearing neighbors for his keep\r\non week-days and preached the wrath of God and hell-fire for his cash\r\nwage--five pound a year--on Sundays. He was a devout man. If thy finger\r\noffend thee, cut it off. But a sort of muscular Christian, too. If thy\r\nenemy cross thee, go out and whale the livers and lights out of\r\nhim--same as we're trying to do to the U-boats now.\r\n\r\n\"Well David lived in the shadow of the church till he was thirty-seven\r\nyears of age. Then the Revolution broke, and David, in whose veins\r\nflowed the blood of old Covenanters, took a running long jump into it.\r\nHe started in as deck-hand or, perhaps, it was cook's helper, but there\r\nwas salt in his veins too, and rapidly he learned his trade. And soon\r\nrose in his new profession until he was master of his own ship, and, as\r\nmaster, raising the devil among the coasters which used to cruise out of\r\nMaritime Province ports in those days. The captures he made of vessels\r\nloaded with hay and potatoes, and so on, materially reduced the high\r\ncost of living for New England folks in those days.\r\n\r\n\"Conyngham? He was a young American lad who did not come of any\r\nparticularly good old stock, meaning that he did not come from\r\nMassachusetts or Virginia probably. He went to sea as a midshipman on\r\nan American sloop-of-war. And he turned out to be some little middy.\r\nEnsign, lieutenant, commander--man, he just ran up the ladder of naval\r\nrank. And got a ship of his own--a fine, young, able sloop-of-war, and\r\nwith this sloop-of-war he would run out from the French channel ports\r\nand harry the English coast and English shipping. Never heard of him?\r\nNo? Well, well!--and he so famous in his day that King George put up a\r\nreward of 1,000 pounds for his capture dead or alive. But they never\r\ncaptured him.\r\n\r\n\"And Barry? He was the Wexford boy who captured 200 English prizes more\r\nor less in the West Indies. Paul Jones trained under Barry before he had\r\na ship of his own. And McDonough? He--but am I boring you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no--it is very interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad. Well, McDonough was the commodore who fought the battle of\r\nLake Champlain against your people. He opened that battle with prayers\r\nfor the living and closed it with prayers for the dead. You want to\r\nwatch out for those fellows who pray when they go to war. Their technic\r\nis sometimes pretty good. Their spirit is always good. While Mac was\r\nlooking over the booty after that fight, a funny thing happened. He----\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, old chap, it's all very interesting, exceedingly interesting,\r\nbut what d'y' say to another little nip before I go? I've got to run\r\nalong to see the chief now. What will you have to drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. A nip of Irish, if you please. And here\"--Lanahan held up his\r\nglass--\"here's to the memory of dead heroes--may they always be\r\npreferred to crawling reptiles when it comes to naming our fighting\r\nships!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the other fellow had gone Lanahan turned to us. \"Say, fellows, I\r\nknow I got Paul Jones and Barry and McDonough right, but how near was I\r\non Davey Jones and Conyngham? Something tells me I got their histories\r\nmixed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis admiral, of whom our fellows used to spin the yarns, was a unique\r\ncharacter. He lacked imagination, and he had the manner of a rat-terrier\r\ntoward people not of his own kind; but he was one good executive.\r\n\r\nDevotion to duty--conscience--those were his beacon lights. He had been\r\nknown, when the minister of the local church wasn't up to standard, to\r\nwalk into the pulpit, and deliver the sermon himself. Before he came to\r\ntake command of this coast district the U-boats had been raising Cain\r\nthere. There was a fleet of steam-trawlers handled by their old fishing\r\ncaptains and crews, whose special duty it was to sweep up the waters\r\njust outside the harbor for mines. It was at that time a dangerous\r\nbusiness, but it was also monotonous. It was a duty most easy to evade.\r\n\r\nWho was to say they had not swept up? No cove at a naval base five\r\nhundred miles away, that was sure! Even if mines were found there after\r\nthey reported it swept clear, what would that prove? The Huns were\r\nlaying mines all the time, weren't they? So--war days are hard enough\r\nanyway--why not ease up now and again?\r\n\r\nThey eased up. Many a snug little place there was along the coast where\r\na crew could go ashore and have a pleasant time for a day or two. There\r\nwere reports to fill out, but what were reports? Ship a clerk in the\r\ncrew and who would know? Surely not some aide at the naval base who\r\nspent his busiest hours taking the admiral's niece to tea fights!\r\n\r\nThe British public will probably stand more from their lawfully ordained\r\nrulers than any other public on earth. They stood for a good many ships\r\nbeing mined on that coast before they began to ask the why of it.\r\n\r\nThe powers returned with facts and figures, percentage tables, and so\r\non, of ships departing and ships arriving; proving clearly that the\r\nnumber of ships lost was no more than was to be expected. Whereupon the\r\nBritish public took to writing letters to the press. British politicians\r\ntake letters to the press seriously; a new man, the admiral we have been\r\ntalking of, was sent to take charge of the district.\r\n\r\nHe got down to business. He fitted out a 30-knot despatch-boat and away\r\nhe went! All along that coast he pounced in on little harbors where\r\nmine-sweepers should be found working outside, but where he found them\r\nworking mostly inside at little sociable gatherings where there was a\r\ndance or the like going on in front and a little something nourishing to\r\ndrink in back. Our stern and efficient admiral lit into them like a gull\r\ninto a school of herring. Out by their gills he hauled them, and pretty\r\nsoon the B. P. began to read less of percentages and more of results.\r\n\r\nOne of the first results was that some trawler skippers lost their jobs,\r\nand new skippers took their places. This was at the time that rewards of\r\nfive pounds or so were offered the skippers bringing a mine into port.\r\n\r\nThat five pounds looked pretty good to one of the new skippers; and when\r\none night at a pub a discharged skipper confided to him where there was\r\na nest of German mines, out he goes into the gray dawn to be there\r\nfirst. He's there first, and sure enough it's a grand little spot for\r\nmines. He hooks into one, lashes it under his quarter and goes scooting\r\nback to harbor, which happens to be the naval base.\r\n\r\nProudly and noisily he steamed along, shouting to everybody he met of\r\nhis good luck, and asking the course to the admiral's ship. Everybody he\r\nmet gave him the course and also the full width of the channel as he\r\npassed. He ran alongside the flag-ship, hailing loudly for the admiral\r\nas he steamed up.\r\n\r\nThe admiral was not on board, but his aide was, and the aide came on to\r\nhave a look over the side. He saw the mine bouncing up and down between\r\nthe mine-sweeper's quarter and his own ship's side. Shove off--\"get away\r\nfrom us!\" yelled the aide. \"Suppose you press one of those little\r\nfeelers and blow us all to pieces--get away, I tell you!\"\r\n\r\nThe mine-sweeper skipper looked up--\"Feelers, sir?\"--and then looked\r\ndown at the mine. \"Feelers, sir? Oh-h, you mean them little 'orns\r\nstickin' out on 'er? Bly-mee, sir, I thought I'd knocked 'em all hoff\r\nafore I lashed her alongside. But 'ave no fear, sir, there's only two of\r\n'em left, and I'll bloomin' well soon\"--he reaches for an oar and went\r\nbouncing aft--\"bloomin' well soon knock them hoff, too, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNQUENCHABLE DESTROYER BOYS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day last summer a group of our destroyers were sent across the\r\nAtlantic. It was a night-and-day strain for all hands--watching out for\r\nraiders, watching out for U-boats, watching out for everything, and\r\ngrabbing snatches of sleep when they could.\r\n\r\nArriving at their naval base, every skipper of the little fleet felt\r\npretty well used up. But every worth-while skipper thinks first of his\r\nmen. One we have in mind passed the word to his crew that whoever cared\r\nto take a run ashore to stretch his legs and forget sea things for a\r\nwhile, why--to go to it. And stay till morning quarters if they wished.\r\n\r\nAs fast as they could clean up and shift into shore clothes they were\r\ngoing over the side. Our young captain felt then that perhaps there was\r\na little something coming to himself; so he turned in, and he was\r\nlogging great things in the sleeping line when the anchor watch, who was\r\nalso a signal quartermaster, woke him up with:\r\n\r\n\"Signal from the admiralty, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read it.\"\r\n\r\nThe S. Q. M. read it--an order to proceed at once to an oil dock and\r\ntake oil.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o'clock at night when our skipper had come to moorings. It\r\nwas now one in the morning, and he knew he could have slept for another\r\nweek; however, orders were to oil up.\r\n\r\nHe turned out and mustered what remained aboard of his crew. There were\r\nabout a dozen. He sent three to the fire-room, three to the engine-room,\r\none here, another there, himself took the wheel, and with his signal\r\nquartermaster acting as a sort of officer of the deck, set out to find\r\nthe oil dock.\r\n\r\nHe had never seen that harbor before that night, but he sheered close in\r\nto every ship's anchor light he saw and hailed for the course to the oil\r\ndock. Most of them did not know, but one now and then passed him a word\r\nor two, and so he bumped along and by and by made the oil dock.\r\n\r\nOfficers who have business with it will tell you that the naval\r\norganization of the British is pretty complete. Our young skipper found\r\neverything ready for him now. Men ashore made fast his lines, connected\r\nup his pipes, filled his tanks--all in good order. Sister destroyers\r\nwere oiling up with him, and with tanks filled they all bumped their way\r\nback to moorings, again without sinking anything along the way.\r\n\r\nIt was then daylight, and right after breakfast they all had to report\r\nto the admiralty, so no use trying to sleep any more. Arrived at the\r\nadmiralty, the officer in command complimented them on their safe run\r\nacross, and then went on to say that of course they had had a trying\r\npassage, and naturally their ships, especially engines and boilers,\r\nwould have to be overhauled--all very natural and proper--and of course\r\nthe needful time for overhauling, and for officers and crew--two, three,\r\nfour days, whatever it was--would be granted; but (they knew the need)\r\nthe question was: How long before they would be ready to go to sea?\r\n\r\nThe young destroyer commanders had discussed that and other\r\npossibilities in the reception-room outside, so when the senior of the\r\ngroup looked from one to the other of his colleagues they had only to\r\nnod, for him to turn to the admiral and say:\r\n\r\n\"We are ready now, sir.\"\r\n\r\nWhich remark should become one of the historic remarks of this war.\r\n\r\nAt this time--at the gates to the North Sea, the English Channel, the\r\nIrish coast--the U-boats were collecting frightful toll. In the\r\nMediterranean they were running wild. Five ships from one convoy in one\r\nday--three of them big P. & O. liners--was one of their records in the\r\nEastern Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nTo the natural question, Why haven't you checked them? almost any young\r\nBritish naval officer felt like saying: \"Check 'em? Try it yourself and\r\ncheck 'em! You go out there and keep your ship zigzagging full speed\r\nnight and day for three years and see how you like it! Go out there in\r\nrough weather and fog with not a minute's let-up, and see if you get to\r\nwhere the fall of a bucket of a dark night will make you jump three feet\r\nin the air or not! Our ships were not built, and our chaps were not\r\ntrained, to beat their rotten game.\"\r\n\r\nSo things were when our fellows took hold, and hearing no word from them\r\nfor a long time and then but a meagre one, it may be that many a citizen\r\non this side was saying to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Well, they're gone, that little flotilla, swallowed up in the mists of\r\nthe Atlantic, and that is all we know about them. And now I wonder what\r\nthey're doing over there? Are they doing great work or are they tied up\r\nto a dock at the naval base, and their officers and crews roistering\r\nashore?\"\r\n\r\nI can say from several weeks' observation later that they were not doing\r\ntoo much roistering ashore. Before leaving this side I found no evidence\r\nthat anybody in Washington wished to suppress the record of what that\r\nlittle fleet was doing. Secretary Daniels and Chairman Creel of the\r\nCommittee on Public Information believed with me that our little fellows\r\nover there were doing things worth recording. This fact is set down here\r\nbecause many people last summer believed there was too much suppression\r\nof the news of our fighting forces; and suspicion of suppression breeds\r\ndistrust. Our fellows perhaps were not doing well. If they were doing\r\nwell, wouldn't we be told more?\r\n\r\nBut they have ideas of their own on these matters over on the other\r\nside, and it is the other side which has most to say of what shall or\r\nshall not be given out for publication. In a previous chapter I have\r\nreported the answer of the British admiral in charge to my request to be\r\nallowed to cruise on an American destroyer. The reply was a flat and\r\nimmediate: \"No.\" They did not allow British writers on British ships;\r\nwhy should they allow an American writer on an American ship?\r\n\r\nIt had to be explained that despite what they allowed or did not allow,\r\nEnglish papers did publish praiseful items about the deeds of the\r\nBritish navy; and even if they did not publish such items, conditions\r\ngoverning publicity in the United States and the British Isles were not\r\nequal. The British navy was a tremendous one and it was operating just\r\noff their own shores; officers and men were regularly going ashore by\r\nthe thousands and to their friends and families, if to nobody else, they\r\ntalked of what was going on; and it does not take long for thousands of\r\nbluejackets to spread the gossip in a country where no spot in it is\r\nmore than forty miles from tide-water, whereas our nearest Atlantic\r\nports were three thousand miles from our base of operations in Europe,\r\nand it was another three thousand miles to our west coast.\r\n\r\nIt also had to be pumped into the admiralty over there that possibly the\r\nAmerican and British publics did not hold to quite the same ideas about\r\ntheir respective navies. It was possible that the 110,000,000 people of\r\nthe United States looked on our navy as not altogether the property of\r\nthe officers and men in it; possibly our 110,000,000 people over here\r\nlooked on the navy as their navy, that they had a right to know\r\nsomething of what it was doing; and so (this item had to be pointed out\r\nto one of our own topside officers, too) as that same public were paying\r\nthe bills of the navy, no harm perhaps to let them in on a few things\r\nor, this being the twentieth century, they might take it into their\r\nheads some day to have no navy at all.\r\n\r\nIt took the foregoing talk and something more before I could get the\r\npermission of the British Admiralty to cruise on one of our own\r\ndestroyers over there. This isn't so much a criticism of the British\r\nAdmiralty as to show that their point of view differs from ours; and to\r\nshow that it was not Washington which was holding up news of our navy\r\nover there.\r\n\r\nAs to what they have been doing! They have been doing great work. I\r\ncruised over there on one of our destroyers. She was five years old, yet\r\none day during an 85-mile run to answer an S O S call she exceeded her\r\nbuilder's trial by half a knot. Incidentally, she saved a merchantman\r\nwhich had been shelled for four hours by a U-boat and her $3,000,000\r\ncargo; also she ran the U-boat under--one of the new big U-boats with\r\ntwo 5.9 deck guns. On the same day two other destroyers of our group\r\ntook from a sinking liner 503 passengers without the loss of a life. One\r\nof these destroyers lashed herself to the sinking ship the more quickly\r\nto get them off; and as the liner went down our little ship had to use\r\nher emergency steam to get away in time. A fourth destroyer of ours got\r\nthe U-boat which sank the liner. That was the record of one little group\r\nof destroyers in one day; and it is detailed here because the writer\r\nhappened to be present when these things happened.\r\n\r\nWhen our fellows first went over they had to learn a few things from the\r\nBritish. We had first to get rid of some childish ideas about depth\r\ncharges. We brought over a toy size of 50 to 60 pounds. They showed us a\r\nman's size one--300 pounds of T N T, a contraption looking so much like\r\na galvanized iron ash-barrel with flattened sides that they call them\r\n\"ash-cans.\"\r\n\r\nThese ash-cans do not have actually to hit the U-boat; to explode one\r\nanywhere near is enough. When our fellows let go one of them, the ship\r\nhas to be going 25 knots to be safe. One of our destroyers was making 11\r\nknots one night--the best she could do under the weather conditions--and\r\nan ash-can was washed overboard by a heavy sea. Our destroyer's stern\r\ncame so near to being blown off that her crew thought sure she was gone;\r\nshe had to feel the rest of the way most carefully to port.\r\n\r\nThis U-boat hunting has been found so wearing on men's nerves that the\r\nBritish Admiralty has a law that our destroyers must remain in port\r\nafter every cruise for periods that average about two-thirds of their\r\ntime at sea. Once our destroyers are back to port and tied up to\r\nmoorings, a U-boat might come up and sink a ship at the harbor entrance\r\nand our fellows not allowed to up-steam and at 'em. It was only after a\r\nhard experience against U-boats that they evolved this law to save men\r\nfrom breaking down.\r\n\r\nIt is a dangerous, hard service on one of the roughest coasts in the\r\nworld--a coast where for seven months or so in the year wind and sea and\r\nstrong cross tides seem to be their daily diet; a service where for days\r\non a stretch it is nothing at all for destroyer crews not to be able to\r\ntake a meal sitting down, not even in chairs lashed to stanchions and\r\none arm free hooked around a stanchion; a service where officers live\r\njammed up in the eyes of the ship and never think at sea of taking off\r\ntheir clothes, and where they sleep (when they do sleep) mostly by\r\nsnatches on chart-house or ward-room transoms.\r\n\r\nAnd for watches: eight hours in every twenty-four, night and day\r\nwatching of their convoy, of their colleagues, of periscopes. (The\r\nprospect of collision with their close-packed convoy and themselves is a\r\nbad chance in itself.) On a destroyer convoying ships the officer of the\r\ndeck has to stand with one eye to the compass ordering, say, two hundred\r\nchanges of course in every hour. And one watch-officer of every\r\ndestroyer has the extra job of acting as chief engineer of the ship; and\r\nwhen a watch-officer had to go aboard a torpedoed ship, or to go in the\r\ncrow's nest in a critical time, to spend hours, it may be, the time so\r\nspent is in addition to his regular eight hours.\r\n\r\nIf he is the executive officer he must also act as navigator; and as it\r\nis important to know just where the ship is any moment of the day or\r\nnight, the navigator does not figure on sleep in any long stretches.\r\nAbout twenty waking hours out of twenty-four is his portion. As for the\r\nskipper: Every single waking hour of his is a heavy strain. I went to\r\nsea with the commander of the alert, intense type. Most of them are of\r\nthat type, but this one particularly so, with eyes, ears, nerves, and\r\nbrain working always at full power. Three hours in twenty-four was a\r\npretty good lay-off for him.\r\n\r\nLively? Our destroyers are about 11-1/2 times as long as they are wide;\r\nwhich does not mean that they cannot keep the sea. They can keep the\r\nsea. Put one of them stern-on to a 90-mile breeze and all the sea to go\r\nwith it, give her 5 or 6 knots an hour head of steam, and she will stay\r\nthere till the ocean is blown dry. But they are engined out of all\r\nproportion to their tonnage, with their great weight of machinery deep\r\ndown; which means that they roll. Oh, but they do roll! Whoopo--down and\r\nback like that! Most any of them will make a complete roll inside of six\r\nseconds. Ours was a 5-1/4-second one. When she got to rolling right, she\r\nwould snap a careless sailor overboard as quickly as you could snap a\r\nbug off the end of a whalebone cane. There is one over there which\r\nrolled 73 degrees--and came back.\r\n\r\nTake one of them when she is hiking along at 20 knots, rolling from 45\r\nto 50 degrees, and just about filling the whale-boat swinging to the\r\nskid deck davits as she rolls! See one dive and take a sea over her\r\nfo'c's'le head and smash in her chart-house bulkhead maybe! Their outer\r\nskin is only 3/16 of an inch thick. See that thin skin give to the sea\r\nlike a lace fan to a breeze! Watch the deck crawl till sometimes the\r\ndeck-plates buckle up into V-shaped ridges! See them with the seas\r\nsloshing up their low freeboard and over their narrow decks, so that men\r\nhave to make use of a sort of trolley line to get about. A man is aft\r\nand has to go forward, say. He hooks onto a rope loop, the same hanging\r\nfrom a fore-and-aft taut steel line about seven feet above deck, and\r\nwhen her stern rises he lifts his feet and shoots and fetches up\r\nBam!--up against the fo'c's'le break. He is forward and wants to go\r\naft--he hooks onto the loop, waits for her bow to rise, lets himself go\r\nand there he is--back to her skid deck.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like rough work. Sometimes it gets rougher than that, and\r\nthen you hear of the wireless operator who was held in his radio shack\r\nfor forty hours. He got pretty hungry, but he preferred the hunger to\r\ncoming out and being washed overboard.\r\n\r\nBut let a machinist's mate tell you in his own way of the night he was\r\nstanding a fire-room watch--this with all due respect to the chart-house\r\nbulkhead, the trolley line, the buckling decks, and the radio operator\r\nwho was confined--this night he was on watch in the fire-room. Was it\r\nrough? He thought so. When he looked down at his feet, there were the\r\nfire-room deck-plates folding in and out like a concertina.\r\n\r\nDestroyer crews do not loaf overmuch around deck. They can't. They live\r\nbelow decks mostly, strapped in when it is rough to a stretch of canvas\r\nlaced to four pieces of iron pipe, set on an angle down against the\r\nship's sides, and called a bunk. Even strapped in so they are sometimes,\r\nwhen she has a good streak on, hove out into the passageways. It was a\r\nyoung doctor of the flotilla who said that, except for their broken arms\r\nand legs, his ship's crew were disgustingly healthy.\r\n\r\nOur officers over there volunteer for this service, and for every one\r\nwho went, there were a dozen who wanted to go. And there is a lot of\r\ndifference between men who go to a duty because they are ordered to go,\r\nand men who go because they want to go. These officers and men--there is\r\nno beating them, except by blowing them off the face of the waters. And\r\neven then they are not always beaten. One of our destroyers was cut down\r\none night by collision. (With so many ships being crowded into a small\r\nsteaming area, collisions are sure to happen.) All hands had to take to\r\nthe rafts in a hurry. It was about two in the morning, one of those\r\nsummer nights in the North when the light comes early. They watched her\r\ngoing under. Her deck settled level with the sea, and as it did so a\r\nyoung irrepressible one sang out: \"What do you say, fellows, to having a\r\nrace around the old girl before she flops under?\" Away they started,\r\nfour or five gangs of them, paddling their life rafts with their hands\r\naround the sinking ship at two in the morning.\r\n\r\nThat is youth; and there is no beating youth. We have had stories of our\r\nsoldiers singing a song that has become very popular since we entered\r\nthe war. We have been told of them singing it under the most varying\r\nconditions: as they camped on the granite blocks of the Hoboken\r\nwater-front; as they climbed over the gangways of ships bound across;\r\ndebarking from ships in European ports; singing it from behind the drawn\r\nshades of coaches rolling across France. There were even those who sang\r\nit while waiting to step into the life-boats on a torpedoed troop-ship;\r\nbut for light-hearted courage has any one beaten that destroyer lad who\r\nwas torpedoed one night last winter?\r\n\r\nWhen the torpedo struck his ship the two depth charges astern were\r\nexploded also. Two 300-pound charges of T N T they were. The little ship\r\nseemed to be lifted out of the water. There was just time to throw over\r\na few life rafts and take a high dive after the rafts. There was no time\r\nto get an S O S message away before the ship went down; so there they\r\nwere--a November night in northern waters, more than half their crew\r\nknown to be dead, their ship sunk, no other ship near and no hope of one\r\ncoming near. It was about as tough a case as men could be expected to\r\nface and hope to live. But there was a boy there--he was jouncing up and\r\ndown in the water to keep warm, and jouncing up and down he was singing\r\n(from out of the dark they heard him), singing cheerfully:\r\n\r\n     \"O boy, O boy, where do we go from here!\"\r\n\r\nIt is the thing spoken of in the early part of this book. Material is a\r\ngreat thing; but personnel has it beaten a dozen ways. Paul Jones with\r\nhis capable seagoers in his little sloop-of-war could raise the devil\r\nwith the enemy. Paul Jones with a line of battleships and forty crews of\r\nmen without spirit would not have caused them ten minutes' loss of\r\nsleep. That singing lad in northern waters was worth a dozen guns.\r\n\r\nOur destroyers went over there at a time when the U-boats were sinking\r\nmore tonnage in one month than Great Britain was building in four; and\r\nbecause of U-boat activities the loss of ships in the usual marine ways\r\nwas far beyond normal. To the weary British our fellows brought a fresh\r\nvigor, a new aggressiveness.\r\n\r\nOnly half a dozen were in that first group, but other groups followed,\r\nand groups are still following. They have not driven the U-boats from\r\nunder the seas, but they have made it possible for merchant ships to\r\nlive in that part of the ocean they are covering.\r\n\r\nSomebody has broken into print somewhere to say that Germany has trouble\r\ngetting U-boat crews; that men have to be driven into U-boats to man\r\nthem. What a queer idea of human courage people who say such things\r\nhave! There are always volunteers, probably always will be--plenty of\r\nvolunteers for any dangerous service. If the U-boat crews were the kind\r\nthat have to be driven to sea, there would be no great harm in them. But\r\nthey are not that kind. They have courage, and they have skill, and\r\nbecause they have courage and skill they are dangerous.\r\n\r\nAfter a year of the U-boat drive England saw a danger of being some day\r\nstarved out; and with England starved out, our army might as well have\r\nstayed on this side last summer; but though the drive is still on,\r\nEngland is not yet starved out, for much of which comfort they can thank\r\nthe officers and men of our little destroyer flotilla.\r\n\r\nAt a time when England was worn and weary with the U-boat game, our\r\nfellows went over to hearten them up; and they are still heartening them\r\nup; and, besides heartening them up, they are getting the U-boats\r\nregularly. How many they are getting I could not say, even if I knew;\r\nbut one of our vice-admirals has publicly stated that they once got five\r\nin one day. And with malice toward none, let us hope for more days like\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARINES HAVE LANDED----\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a little girl at home, not old enough to read long words, but\r\nable to read a picture, as she put it; and there was a print of a\r\ncompany of marines leaving one of our navy-yards, and she said: \"The\r\nmarine soldiers going away--more trouble somewheres, isn't there, papa?\"\r\n\r\nWhich caused her papa to recall that from where he was born and lived\r\nthe first years of his life he had only to look out of his top window\r\nand across the harbor to see a big navy-yard; and while he was still too\r\nyoung to read a paper, he had seen marines boarding ships and marching\r\noff to trains; and just as sure as he did the older people would read\r\nfrom that night's or next morning's paper of trouble somewhere abroad.\r\n\r\nAnd always they went without any fuss. Most of us would have more to say\r\nabout going to the office of a snowy morning than do the marines on\r\nleaving for some far-away country, from where, as they know by past\r\nrecords of the corps, quite a few of them are never coming back. They\r\nwere the original efficiency boys. They slung their rifles, hooked on\r\ntheir packs and went; and that ended that part of it.\r\n\r\nBut after they were gone people living near naval quarters waited for\r\nthe next word; and that next word so often came in the form of one\r\nlaconic sentence, the same cabled back by the topside naval officer or\r\nsome American consul, that we used to wonder if they had a rubber stamp\r\nfor it--that laconic, reassuring sentence! When our country erects a\r\nmemorial structure to the United States Marine Corps, she should chisel\r\nover the main front:\r\n\r\n     _The Marines Have Landed and Have the Situation Well in Hand_\r\n\r\nLanded in some tropic port with some hard-pronouncing name, they have,\r\nshoving off from the ship's side with their rifles and their packs, to\r\nget a toe-hold somewhere against two, five, ten times their number\r\nblazing away at them from behind sand-hills, or roof-tops, or a fine\r\ngrowth of jungle, it may be.\r\n\r\nThe others are not always as well equipped as our fellows and they may\r\nhave no advance supply-base; but they know how to campaign. South of us\r\nare multitudes who will take a bag of corn, a water-bottle, and a pair\r\nof straw sandals and go shuffling over the hill trails for forty or\r\nfifty miles a day. And don't think they won't fight. They will. In\r\ncountries where boys of twelve and thirteen pack a gun and go off with\r\ntheir fathers in the army, they probably do not worry overmuch about\r\ndying early.\r\n\r\nFrom their retreats they like to sally forth at intervals and have a\r\nwallop at our fellows. There was a corporal in Haiti, on outpost, with\r\nhalf a dozen loyal natives acting as policemen with him. The native\r\nguards slept in barracks by themselves; our marine in a little low shack\r\nset up on posts a hundred yards away, with a native who acted as cook\r\nand general helper. The next outpost was six miles away.\r\n\r\nA band of outlaws rushed the native police in their barracks at this\r\npost one night, and such as they did not shoot up they ran into the\r\nbrush. Our corporal was awakened from sound slumber by the firing and\r\nshouting at the barracks. A few volleys through the sides of his own\r\nshack waked him up good. He pulled on his trousers, taking time to\r\nfasten them only by one button at his waist. There was no time for\r\nsocks; he pulled on his shoes, but had no time to lace them. A marine is\r\ntrained to be neat in his attire, and so our corporal apologetically\r\nexplained later that he had got no farther than that in his dressing\r\nwhen he heard them trying to burst in his front door.\r\n\r\nThe corporal sent his native cook to the rear door, while he fixed his\r\nbayonet to his rifle and stood guard over the front door. They had it\r\nall but stove in when he began cutting loose like three men with his\r\nrifle through the door. He killed a man there.\r\n\r\nThey then began to smash in the window nearest the door. He pried open\r\nthe window with his bayonet, and got there before them. There was a big\r\nblack fellow at the broken window. Our marine shot him dead, which gave\r\nhim time to turn to the side window, which they had now broken in with\r\nthe butts of their rifles. He got one there. There was another close up\r\nwhom he hit but did not kill; and he dropped another one on the edge of\r\nthe shadows outside. The cook, catching the spirit of the thing, killed\r\none at the rear door on his own account.\r\n\r\nThe bandits had enough, and left. Next evening, when his officer came\r\nalong with a squad, he found our corporal with his wounded under guard,\r\nhis four dead ones in a neat row, and himself and his cook frying\r\nchicken in the twilight, cheerfully able to report that he had the\r\nsituation well in hand.\r\n\r\nThey are a sharpshooting rifle outfit. Down in Vera Cruz during the late\r\ntrouble a platoon of marines were at the foot of a street leading up\r\nfrom the water-front. They had cleaned up things all about them and\r\nthought they were in for a rest; and they wanted their rest--a hot\r\ntropic day with the heat rolling off the asphalt where they lay.\r\n\r\nThere came a ping! of a rifle bullet among them; and half a minute or so\r\nlater another ping! They watched, and up the street they saw the head,\r\narm, and shoulder of a man with a rifle come poking around the corner of\r\na building, and ping! another one, and this time one of their men hit. A\r\nbad hombre, that one.\r\n\r\n\"Get him!\" said their officer, and named two of them to get him.\r\n\r\nThe two men lay down on the asphalt; and when their friend next poked\r\nhis head and shoulders around the corner, they fired. They saw the adobe\r\nplaster spatter from a corner of the building just under the man's chin;\r\nbut that wasn't getting him. They jacked their sights up 50 yards,\r\nmaking it 800 yards; and when next the native showed around the corner\r\nthey both got him--one plumb between the eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was good shooting; but there was no special comment after it. The\r\ntalk would have come if they hadn't got him.\r\n\r\nBut it is not always a matter of fighting or shooting efficiency. There\r\nwas that bad hombre, Juan Calcano of Santo Domingo--Juan the Terrible,\r\nthe natives called him. Juan and his gang had a headquarters in the\r\nmountains. From there they came riding down into the valleys--shooting,\r\nrobbing, standing quiet natives on their heads generally. Juan had quite\r\na little territory under tribute. He came down into La Ramona, where was\r\na custom-house and guard. He shot up the guards, took all the gold in\r\nthe custom-house, and rode away, saying: \"Come after me who dares!\"\r\n\r\nThe marines did not worry about the daring part; but he was too strongly\r\nintrenched for a direct attack. Your professional soldier, above all\r\nmen, prefers not to throw away good men's lives. They considered\r\nmatters; and one day they set out, three marine officers and thirty men,\r\nfor Juan's country. One of those tropical hurricanes came along the same\r\nday they started, blew down trees, filled rivers to over their banks,\r\nand made them wade waist-deep in the mud of the roads. It was tough\r\ngoing, but it had its good side--there were not many people abroad.\r\n\r\nThey arrived near the village where Juan was known to be. An American\r\nmarine would not have stood much chance to get back if Juan had known\r\none was around; but one of the officers rigged up as a mule trader and\r\nwent looking for Juan. He found him, taking it easy until the roads\r\nafter the storm should become passable, and allow himself and his men to\r\nsashay into the valley again.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of people--white, and black, and brown--came Juan's way to do\r\nbusiness--to buy mules and horses, for instance. In the course of his\r\ntravels in the valley Juan had helped himself to some very fine mules\r\nand horses. Along comes this man this day--American, English, French,\r\nSpanish, who knows? Or cares? He talked money--cash--for a good pair of\r\nmules. No old spavined creatures, but young, strong, sound ones.\r\n\r\nYes, Juan had just such a pair of mules. Oh, a superb young pair! He\r\nwould see. Truly yes. Would the stranger señor come into his house so\r\nthat Juan might speak more confidentially of them? The stranger would.\r\nAnd did. But before Juan could unload all he had to say about his mules\r\nthe mule buyer drew a large service automatic and slipped Juan out to\r\nwhere thirty-two marines, officers and men, were in hiding. And they put\r\nJuan in jail, and all it cost was one mule--not Juan's--drowned while\r\ncrossing a stream during the hurricane.\r\n\r\nThe marines have a great fighting record; but the marines do more than\r\nfight. After all, men cannot be handling rifle and bayonet every waking\r\nminute--they would become abnormal creatures if they did, of use only in\r\nwar time; and it would be a terrible world if war were our end and aim.\r\nThe marines get aviation, search-light, wireless, telegraphic, heliograph,\r\nand other signal drill. They plant mines, put up telegraph and telephone\r\nlines in the field, tear down or build up bridges, sling from a ship and\r\nset up or land guns as big as 5-inch for their advance base work.\r\n\r\nIt is a belief with marines that the corps can do anything. Right in New\r\nYork City is a marine printing plant with a battery of linotypes and a\r\nrow of presses. They set their own type, write their own stuff (even to\r\nthe poetry), draw their own sketches, do their own photography, their\r\nown color work--everything. Every man in that plant is a marine, enlisted\r\nor commissioned. Every one has seen service somewhere outside his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOne was in a tropic country one time after an all-night march to a river\r\nwhere the ferry was a water-soaked bamboo raft. They had to wait until\r\nsome native might happen along with a bull--or it might be a cow--to tow\r\nthe raft across. After crossing the river twice in that day, the young\r\nmarine commander halted on the bank and said: \"That's sure not crossing\r\nin a hurry if we had to. Might's well go to it and build a bridge right\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nThey cut down trees, got a portable pile-driver from their transport,\r\nrigged it up and set to work. They hoisted the hammer--a good heavy\r\none--and let it drop. Bam! she struck, and into the mud for about two\r\nfeet went the pile. Fine! They hoisted the hammer again--four men\r\nhauling on pulley blocks did the hoisting--and let her go again. This\r\ntime instead of a fine bam! the hammer went a fine splasho! into the\r\nriver. The great heat and dampness of the place had warped the runways;\r\nalmost every other time they let that hammer drop, it jumped the runways\r\nand into the river.\r\n\r\nBut that was all right. They could fish her out and hoist her up by man\r\npower again. It was when they left the solid bank and had to put out\r\ninto the river that their troubles began. A pile-driver ought to have a\r\npretty solid foundation. Ought to have! They took two dugout canoes,\r\nlashed them together, put a bamboo deck across, set their pile-driver on\r\nthe deck and turned to again. It made a kind of a wabbly base; besides\r\nhauling the hammer out every time it jumped into the river, they had to\r\nsee that it didn't come bouncing down atop of their own heads or through\r\nthe canoe deck. However, they were getting action. They finished driving\r\nthe piles and setting up the stringers.\r\n\r\nFor their bridge floor they laid down wood shingles, and over that a mat\r\nmade out of woven bamboo strips. For a top deck? Well, it was a coral\r\nisland and the roads of that country were of pounded coral; they put a\r\ntop dressing of pounded coral across the bridge.\r\n\r\nAnd then the young marine commander looked her over and figured on the\r\ndimensions of his struts and stringers, and said: \"Some class! She'll\r\nstand a two-ton load.\" And then along came a steam-roller from off the\r\ntransport, and the roller weighed five tons and it was important that\r\nit be passed across. \"Go ahead,\" said the marine commander--\"only I\r\nhope you can swim!\" And they all camped on the bank to watch. The\r\nsteam-roller man was an optimist and a literary person: \"You may have\r\nbuilded better than you know, captain!\" The bridge settled down another\r\nfoot, but the roller got across, and back and over many more times;\r\nwhich set the younger marines to standing on the bank and saying:\r\n\"That's us--bridge builders!\"\r\n\r\nThe fight in the shack, the capture of Calcano, the sharpshooting at\r\nVera Cruz, the building of that coral-floored bridge, are not set down\r\nhere as wonderful stunts. They are set down because the writer happened\r\nto bump into them during a casual hour's inspection of their records.\r\nScores of more heroic or ingenious samples could be served up by anybody\r\nwho cared to dig deep into the records. These are detailed here, because\r\nthey could be briefly told and at the same time show the marine's\r\ncharacteristic qualities: courage, ingenuity, technic, and industry.\r\n\r\nHere we might mention that it is not in itself an act of war to land\r\nmarines on foreign soil. It was sending ashore the bluejackets at Vera\r\nCruz that made it an act of war. To protect American lives and property\r\nin Nicaragua a battalion of marines landed there a few years ago. They\r\nhad some sharp fighting, but it was not an act of war. Do you begin to\r\nsee him as a diplomatic asset? And perhaps why all this landing action\r\ncomes his way? Most of us have probably forgotten the details of that\r\nNicaraguan landing; but--unless they have been jacked out lately--a\r\ncompany of those marines are still there, looking out for American\r\ninterests. Only a company, but still hanging on.\r\n\r\nCourage, ingenuity, industry--they need them all. Most of us will\r\nprobably have to stop to remember that the marines who landed in Haiti\r\nand Santo Domingo are still there. And running things in their usual\r\nefficient fashion. There was the usual fighting to get a toe-hold, the\r\nusual fighting to retain place, the usual establishing of outposts, with\r\nthe usual killed and wounded already probably forgotten by most of us.\r\nPerhaps they are too far away to make absorbing newspaper items; perhaps\r\nit is the Big War overshadowing all else.\r\n\r\nIn Haiti and Santo Domingo it was the old story of political factions,\r\neach faction having its own little gang of fighting men till our fellows\r\ncame in and ran most of them into the hills. When the marines took\r\ncharge they found that pretty much everything on the island had gone to\r\nwrack. As, for instance, under the old French régime there had been some\r\nsplendid roads in Haiti, but now they were hardly more than sewers in\r\nthe towns and a drainage for the hill slopes of the country.\r\n\r\nThe marines repaired the roads; not always using the picks and shovels\r\nthemselves, but seeing to it that somebody did, paying a living wage for\r\nsuch work to the natives. Sometimes bandits--who are quite often gentle\r\ncreatures when out of training--captured bandits were allowed to quit\r\njail to do useful work in this line. The marines installed sanitary\r\nmethods, saw that courts of justice were resumed, marine officers\r\nthemselves serving as justices until they found natives who could do\r\nthat service. Likewise they collected and disbursed taxes.\r\n\r\nAbove all, they did away with the old reign of terror, when no man's\r\nlife was safe if he happened to be on the wrong side. When the bandits\r\nwere running around unchecked, it was not safe for a whole family to go\r\nto market together. Generally the women went to sell their little\r\nproduce, while the men stayed behind to guard the little property at\r\nhome. Now--the natives speak of the wonder of it--the roads on\r\nmarket-days are crowded with both men and women.\r\n\r\nAt first they had distrust of the marine; not altogether because he was\r\na foreigner (the tropical people probably are less distrustful of us\r\nthan we of them)--he was an armed soldier. But they learned to know him,\r\nand now the native salutes and smiles without effort at the marine in\r\npassing. When one particular marine officer left there to come home\r\nrecently, crowds of native men, women, and children came down, some to\r\nweep, but all to wish him Godspeed in going.\r\n\r\nThe marine is sometimes termed soldier and sailor too, which is not\r\ncorrect. He is not a sailor and does not claim to be. When not in\r\nbarracks ashore he lives aboard some war-ship afloat; and on shipboard\r\nhe does certain guard work and handles the secondary batteries. But he\r\ndoes not have to sailorize; the bluejacket takes care of that part, and\r\ntakes care of it well. The notion that a marine must qualify as a sailor\r\naboard ship has probably cost the corps many a prospective recruit.\r\n\r\nTo call him a seagoing soldier is more nearly correct. When it is not an\r\nact of war to land marines on foreign soil, it is good business to keep\r\nthem where landings can be quickly made with them. So his being kept\r\naboard ship, perhaps. Bluejackets have taken part in landing-parties,\r\ntoo, but it is not to black the bluejacket's eye to say that it is not\r\nhis regular job. The bluejacket's work is aboard ship--on the bridge, in\r\nmagazines, in turrets, below decks. Advance shore work is the marine's\r\nspecialty, and he goes to it pretty much as a man with a dinner-pail\r\ngoes to work in the subway.\r\n\r\nHe is the first to land, the last to leave, and to name the places where\r\nhe has seen service--well, one of them wrote a song once.\r\n\r\n\"From the hills of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli,\" it began. But he\r\nhas seen more than Mexico or the Mediterranean since. He could now say:\r\n\r\n     \"From the hills of Montezuma to the gates of old Peking\r\n      He has heard the shrapnel bursting, he has heard the\r\n          Mauser's ping!\r\n      He has known Alaskan waters and the coral roads of Guam,\r\n      He has----\"\r\n\r\nBut it's like calling a roll--Egypt, Algeria, Tripoli, Abyssinia,\r\nMexico, China, Japan, Korea, Cuba, Porto Rico, Panama, Nicaragua, Haiti,\r\nSanto Domingo, Alaska, the Philippines, Formosa, Sumatra, Hawaii, Samoa,\r\nGuam--like calling the roll of tropic countries and a few less warm to\r\nsay where he has been.\r\n\r\nHe has been most everywhere, done most everything. Did you ever see any\r\nmounted marines? There is a guard of mounted marines right now with the\r\nlegation in Peking; and once a platoon of marines, on duty in Africa,\r\nnot being able to get big enough horses, rode camels through the wilds\r\nof Abyssinia to the palace of old Menelik.\r\n\r\nIn speaking here of the marines, no man or officer has been named.\r\nThat is done of a purpose. In talking of the corps, from the\r\ntopsiders down--generals, colonels, majors, captains lieutenants,\r\nand enlisted men--one fact stuck out: They all played up the corps.\r\nAll individuals--officers and men--were made subordinate to the corps.\r\nSo here, taking the tip, no names are named. A soldier speaks of his\r\nregiment, a bluejacket of his ship. The Marine Corps is made up of\r\ncompanies, regiments, battalions, divisions; but it is the corps of\r\nwhich the marine always speaks.\r\n\r\nIf you ask the members of any other outfit to name the model military\r\nunit, they may name their own branch of the service first; but if they\r\ndo, it is almost a sure bet that they will name the United States Marine\r\nCorps next. When they do not name themselves first, they name the\r\nmarines first. And this does not apply to outfits in this country alone.\r\n\r\nBy the look of things now, there probably will be plenty of war before\r\nwe are done. If any young fellow is wishful to be in the middle of it,\r\nwe would say: Consider the marines. You may not see them mentioned every\r\nmorning in the press reports, but be sure of this--they are there and on\r\nthe job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAVY AS A CAREER\r\n\r\n\r\nA young fellow reading all this stuff about the doings of our destroyers\r\nmight be inclined to look on the navy as pure adventure, which would not\r\nbe to get it quite right. The adventure is there, but there is something\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe navy will take a young man, feed and clothe him, give him a good\r\nall-round training, and while he is yet in middle age retire him with at\r\nleast $60 a month for the rest of his life. No matter how low his rating\r\nhas been, that $60 a month is certain after his thirty years of service;\r\nwhile, if he has shown moderate intelligence and ambition, he can count\r\non close to $100 a month, and this without his having ever been a\r\ncommissioned officer. The years after his retirement he may spend as he\r\npleases--go into business, get another job, and make another wage on top\r\nof his pension. He can go to jail if he prefers: whatever he does,\r\nalways there is that sheet-anchor of a pension to windward.\r\n\r\nApart from the fighting end of it, most of us possibly do not know just\r\nwhat navy life means to-day. We all know that man-of-war's men no longer\r\nlie out on rolling yard arms to reef salt-crusted sails in gales of\r\nwind; but in what else lies the difference? Some of us, possibly, do not\r\nknow that.\r\n\r\nThe navy still wants men with the seagoing instinct--men who can\r\nsailorize, who can hand, splice, and steer; but more than ever the navy\r\nis looking for men who can do other things. The navy wants ship-fitters,\r\nblacksmiths, plumbers, electricians, wireless operators, carpenters,\r\nboiler-makers, painters, printers, store-keepers, bakers, cooks,\r\nstewards, drug clerks; even as it wants gunners, boatmen, quartermasters,\r\nsailmakers, firemen, oilers, and it will take clarinet, trombone, and\r\ncornet players and the like for the ship's band.\r\n\r\nIf a man has no trade the navy will teach him one. There are navy\r\nschools for electricians, shipwrights, ship-fitters, carpenters,\r\npainters, coppersmiths, ship's cooks, bakers, stewards, and musicians.\r\nThere are schools where yeomen (ship's clerks) are taught all about\r\ndepartmental papers; there is a Hospital Corps school; an aeronautic\r\nschool; a school for deep-sea diving. (There are no schools for\r\nblacksmiths or boiler-makers; these must have mastered their trades\r\nbefore enlistment.)\r\n\r\nWhen a young fellow enlists he is sent to one of several naval\r\ntraining-stations. Here they are quartered in barracks--well-aired,\r\nwell-lighted, well-heated buildings. At one place, where the climate is\r\nmild, the boys sleep in barracks in bungalows with upper sides of\r\ncanvas, which are rolled down to let in sun and air in fine weather and\r\nlaced up against bad weather.\r\n\r\nAt all training-stations there are mess-halls, reading-rooms, libraries;\r\nalso gymnasiums, athletic fields, and ball parks. At all stations there\r\nare setting-up drills, gymnastic, swimming and signal exercises, ship\r\nand boat training. The men go on hikes, fight sham battles, dig trenches.\r\nLine-officers give them advice which will be of use to them on shipboard\r\nlater; service doctors and chaplains hand them hygienic and moral truths\r\nthat will be of use to them anywhere at any time.\r\n\r\nA recruit goes from the training-school to a cruising ship, where he may\r\nfind himself--according to his work--doing watch duty four hours on to\r\neight hours off; or working at hours like a man ashore--turning to at\r\neight or nine o'clock and knocking off at four or five or six o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nWar-ships formerly meant close living quarters; and ships formerly went\r\noff on cruises on which the men sometimes did not set foot on shore for\r\nsix months or a year, and quite often they had to go for months without\r\ntaste of fresh meat or vegetables. Those days are gone. Ships still make\r\nlong cruises from home, but they do not keep the sea as they used to.\r\nService regulations require that men now be given a run ashore once in\r\nthree months; and \"beef boats\" travel with all fleets.\r\n\r\nThe everlasting holystoning of wooden decks and the dim lanterns hung at\r\nintervals from low-hanging beams--they are gone. The only dim lanterns\r\nnow are the \"battle-lanterns\" in use at night war practice; and they are\r\nswung to steel bulkheads by electric wires. Quarter-decks, forecastle\r\nheads, and bridges are still planked on the big ships, and such do still\r\nhave to be holystoned on special days; but the great stretches between\r\ndecks are now laid in linoleum on the hard steel itself; electric lights\r\nare all over the ship, and, as for the low beams, the new big ships are\r\nso high-girdered that hammock-hooks on the berth-deck have to be made\r\nextra long so the men won't have to get stepladders to turn in. A\r\nbattleship nowadays is about 600 feet long, 100 feet wide, has seven or\r\neight decks, with turrets, bridges, military masts, and smoke-pipes\r\ntopside. Between decks are magazines, storerooms, engine-rooms,\r\nboiler-rooms, dynamo-rooms, mess-rooms, ice-rooms, repair-shops,\r\nstaterooms, office-rooms, sick-bays, galleys, laundries, pantries--but\r\nonly ship-constructors can tell you offhand how many hundreds of\r\ncompartments are below decks of a present-day big war-ship.\r\n\r\nShe is a great workshop, an office-structure, a big power-plant, a\r\nfloating hotel--and a few other things. But above all she is meant to be\r\na home for ten or twelve hundred officers and men.\r\n\r\nA man may not be given duty on a battleship or battle cruiser; he may be\r\nsent to a scout cruiser or a beef boat or a gunboat, which, being\r\nsmaller, will bounce and roll around more in heavy weather and not offer\r\nso much room to move around in; but he will get used to the bouncing\r\naround, and always he will find some variety and some comfort in his\r\ndaily life.\r\n\r\nThat item of comfort might as well be counted in as important. It is\r\nsomething to know that, no matter what else happens, there are hot meals\r\nwaiting a man three times a day, and a dry change of clothing, and a dry\r\nhammock to turn into nights. Even on deck duty in bad weather a man can\r\nget into slicker, rubber boots, and rain-hat, and at the worst be almost\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nNavy life is not meant to be a perpetual entertainment--not though they\r\ndo hold regular smokers on the quarter-decks of the big ships. To lie\r\nfor months off a tropic port waiting for something to happen--that is\r\nnot exhilarating; and coaling ship, even with the band playing--that is\r\nno joy. But the watching of tropic ports passes; and the ship has to\r\nsteam many a mile before she must be coaled again. So, taking it in the\r\nlong perspective, it is a moderately varied life, an outdoor life, and\r\nunder hygienic conditions of the best. Right now, war with us, there is\r\ngoing to be some danger; but we are assuming that any man who thinks of\r\njoining the navy is prepared for a little danger.\r\n\r\nA man may enlist in the navy up to thirty-five years of age, provided he\r\nis at least 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighs 128 pounds, has a 33-inch\r\nchest, possesses normal vision, a moderate number of sound teeth, is\r\nfree from disease or deformity, and is an American citizen. Sometimes\r\nmen shy on some measurement are passed if above average otherwise. A boy\r\nseventeen (the youngest enlistment age) must be 5 feet 2 inches and\r\nweigh 110 pounds. When a boy or a man enlists he goes at once on the\r\npayroll. With his pay goes a clothing allowance sufficient to cover all\r\nservice demands; with his pay also goes nourishing and abundant food.\r\n\r\nEnlistments are of four years for men. A boy's enlistment runs to his\r\nmajority. A man may work up to be a C. P. O. (chief petty officer) in\r\nhis first enlistment. The navy is full of men who have done that. During\r\nthis war many a recruit should make his C. P. O. quickly, for there is\r\nnothing in the Regulations to prevent a recruit from making his C. P. O.\r\novernight. The habit of most officers is to rate up good men in their\r\ndivisions as fast as vacancies will permit.\r\n\r\nA C. P. O.'s base pay may run up to $77 a month. With re-enlistment that\r\nbase pay is increased. A man re-enlisting without delay gets a bounty of\r\nfour months' pay. (Figure that extra re-enlistment money--four months'\r\npay every four years, the same with interest at the navy savings-account\r\nrate of 4 per cent--and see what it amounts to after thirty years'\r\nservice.) That extra re-enlistment money is not figured into the pension\r\nprobabilities, as stated in the beginning of this article. Consider that\r\nand then consider how many men have to work until they are too old to\r\nwork any further and who, after all their years of labor, go on the\r\nscrap-heap without a dollar against the poverty of their old age.\r\n\r\nBesides the base pay of a man's rating there is extra money for men\r\ndoing special work. (Neither has this been reckoned in the pension\r\npossibilities.) Certain gun-pointers, gun-captains, coxswains, stewards,\r\nand cooks get extra money up to $10 a month. Men in submarines get $1\r\nextra for every day their boat submerges up to $15 a month. Men acting\r\nas mail-clerks draw up to $30 a month extra; ship's tailors up to $20 a\r\nmonth extra. Men in the Flying Corps get 50 per cent more than the base\r\npay their rating calls for. Every man in the service draws a small extra\r\nsum for good conduct.\r\n\r\nA chief petty officer is not the highest rating of the enlisted service.\r\nThere is a most efficient body of men called warrant-officers, who wear\r\na sword, are called \"Mr.,\" and draw up to $2,400 a year. There are\r\nwarrant boatswains, gunners, machinists, carpenters, pharmacists, and\r\npay-clerks. But they must remain in service, even as most commissioned\r\nofficers, till they are sixty-four, before they draw their pension of\r\nthree-quarters pay. Also, like commissioned officers, they get no\r\nclothing allowance and have to pay for their food.\r\n\r\nThe matter of becoming a commissioned officer may interest the recruit.\r\nOne hundred appointments may be made to Annapolis every year from among\r\nthe younger enlisted men of the navy. Young fellows who wish to try for\r\nthis are given special opportunities for study. The proviso that an\r\napplicant must be under twenty years of age and have been at least one\r\nyear in service to make Annapolis is going to bar the way to some. For\r\nsuch there is another way--warrant. A warrant boatswain, gunner, or\r\nmachinist of four years' standing and still under thirty-five years of\r\nage may take an examination for ensign. Twelve warrant-officers may be\r\nmade ensigns annually. If they pass, they thereafter go on up exactly as\r\nany Annapolis graduate. A warrant pay-clerk may go up to be junior\r\npaymaster, where he will rank with an ensign.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is for the business or ambitious side. Somebody may ask:\r\nWill the young fellow who looks on the navy as a business proposition\r\nmake a good fighting man?\r\n\r\nWell, in the judgment of men who study the game, almost any young fellow\r\nyou meet along the street has it in him to make a good fighting man. The\r\nfighting habit is more a habit of mind than of body. Habituating the\r\nmind to the fighting game is what makes our sailors, soldiers, and\r\nmarines do the right thing almost automatically in crises; and this\r\nalmost automatically correct action makes for the greater safety of\r\nshipmates or comrades in time of peril.\r\n\r\nIn this book only the work of our destroyers in this war has been spoken\r\nof. That is because only our destroyers have come in contact with enemy\r\nships; but all along the line the personnel is of equal caliber.\r\n\r\nOur navy is crowded with men who will face any danger. Some years ago\r\none of our battleships was on the battle-range, with bags of powder\r\nstowed in her turrets to save time in loading and firing the guns. A\r\nspark got to the bags of powder. There was an explosion and a fire.\r\nDirectly underneath was the handling-room. Burning pieces of cloth fell\r\nfrom the turret down into the handling-room. The crew of that\r\nhandling-room could have jumped into the passageway, made their way up a\r\nladder, and so on to the free and safe air of the open deck. What they\r\ndid was to stand by to stamp out what fire they could.\r\n\r\nLeading from the handling-room were the magazines. The doors of the\r\nmagazines were open. Men jumped into the magazines and buttoned the keys\r\nof the bulkhead doors so that there would be no crevice for sparks. In\r\ndoing that they locked themselves in; and once in they had to stay in.\r\nAbove them, they knew, was a turret full of men and officers dead and\r\ndying; they knew that fire was raging around them, too, and that the\r\nnext thing would be for the people outside to flood the magazines. The\r\nmagazines were flooded; when things were under control and the doors\r\nopened, the water in the magazines was up to the men's necks.\r\n\r\nWhile that was going on below decks, in the turret were other men and\r\nofficers, including the chaplain, not knowing what was going on below,\r\nand expecting every moment to be blown up into the sky; but there they\r\nwere, easing the last moments of the men who were not already dead.\r\nThirty all told were killed in the turret. All concerned behaved well,\r\nbut no better than they were expected to behave.\r\n\r\nA few years ago there was a destroyer off Hatteras. It was before\r\ndaybreak of a winter's morning in heavy weather. A boiler explosion blew\r\nout her side from well below the water-line clear up through to her main\r\ndeck. Men were killed by the explosion; others were badly scalded. A\r\nsteam burn is an agonizing thing, yet some of these scalded men went\r\nback into that hell of a boiler-room and hauled out shipmates who, to\r\ntheir notion, were more badly burned than themselves. One such rescuer\r\ndied of his burns. The hole in the deck and top side of that destroyer\r\nwas twelve feet across, yet her commander and crew got her to Norfolk\r\nunder her own steam. Commander and crew behaved well, but no better than\r\nthey were expected to behave.\r\n\r\nThere is a chief boatswain in the navy who had the duty of taking a\r\nship's steamer with a crew to look after the ship's target at battle\r\npractice. A target is a frame of canvas set up on a raft of logs. The\r\nduty of the steamer was to stand off to one side and make a record of\r\nthe hits.\r\n\r\nThis boatswain likes to joke, to try out new men. On the run from the\r\nship he called the roll and said: \"Now, boys, in this work one of you\r\nwill have to stay on the raft to count the hits. Of course it is\r\ndangerous work. I won't say that it isn't. The man going may not come\r\nback. The chances are\"--he eyed them one after another--\"that whoever\r\ngoes will never come off the raft alive. Now, I can name the one who\r\nwill have to do that work. But I don't want to have to name him. I'll\r\nlet you draw lots.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a sheet of paper and cut it into strips. His crew--all\r\napprentice boys, all fresh from the training-school--drew the slips. The\r\nlad who drew the short slip was no better or braver to look at than most\r\nof the others. He looked at his slip of paper and then in a sort of\r\nwonder at the sea and sky.\r\n\r\nHe came back to his short slip. His lips trembled. He prayed to himself.\r\nThen he went down into his blouse pocket and fished out a stub of a\r\npencil. He was whiter than ever, and shaking. \"Can I have a sheet of\r\npaper, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want a sheet of paper for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like, sir, to write a note to my mother before I go.\"\r\n\r\nTo pick out a few isolated instances from service records and shout:\r\n\"There is the proof of general efficiency, of courage, of--\"\r\nwhatnot--that would be idle. These were not taken from the service\r\nrecords. Officers and men in the turret explosion, in the destroyer\r\naccident, in the raft incident, are mentioned here because the writer,\r\nat different times, has cruised with them.\r\n\r\nThey all behaved well; but no better than they were expected to.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked the boatswain in the raft case if he expected the boy to\r\nquit, he said: \"Quit! They never quit.\"\r\n\r\nThis talk of heroism and pensions in the same breath may not seem to\r\njibe; somebody is going to wonder if the man who thinks of the money\r\nside of the navy in the beginning isn't going to think too much of it in\r\nthe end. But there is a point of view which should be reckoned with, and\r\na type of man, of a good fighting man, who should be listened to in this\r\nmatter. Why should not a man who risks his life in his daily calling\r\nhave the normal comforts and his family the ordinary necessities of\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nI know a fireman, an efficient, brave man--a man with a record. One\r\nnight--we were in a drug store in a crowded city--he was answering the\r\nargument of a man working in a big factory.\r\n\r\nSaid the fireman: \"You're making your five or six--yes, and eight--dollars\r\na day, in lively times like now. All right. But the lively times will\r\npass, and there'll come weeks when you won't make any four or five or\r\nsix dollars a day, and there'll come weeks when you'll be on half-time.\r\nAverage it up and you won't get any more than I will in the long run. And\r\nwhen I'm through, when I'm fifty-five, I get a pension, and with a few\r\ngood years left to me. And where are you then? Out on the street or some\r\nhome for the aged--if they will take you.\r\n\r\n\"Save money as I go along? I don't figure on it--not with a family and\r\ntrying to give them the kind of food they need and the little things\r\nthat live boys and girls--especially girls--care as much for as the grub\r\nthey eat and the clothes they wear. But if I do spend all my pay, my\r\nfamily are getting the good of it, I don't go into the discard at the\r\nend. And when I'm up on a shaky roof in a bad fire, maybe I'll be more\r\nready to take a chance, knowing that if I go through and cripple myself,\r\nthere's something coming to the wife and family after it.\"\r\n\r\nThe fireman's argument holds for the navy, except that in the navy they\r\nget through younger and with a bigger pension.\r\n\r\nIs there any romance in the navy nowadays? Who can answer for all?\r\nProbably as much now as ever there was. Why should substituting\r\nsmoke-pipes for spars, and propellers for sails, kill the thing that\r\nthrills us? I've seen men washing down decks of a tropic morning, and,\r\nninety miles inland, old Orizaba showing his white head above the\r\nclouds; and some of those men thought it was slow work and others\r\nthought it was great.\r\n\r\nOn a scout cruiser to African ports, or a thousand miles up a Chinese\r\nriver on a gunboat, among the South Sea Islands on a light cruiser, some\r\nmen return with dumb lips and others can keep you awake till morning\r\nwith the tales of what they've seen.\r\n\r\nA nineteen-year-old big-gun pointer sits atop of his bicycle saddle, and\r\nthe enemy fleet is swinging into range. Will it be like shooting clay\r\npipes in a gallery or will a warmer wave go rolling through his veins as\r\nhe presses the button?\r\n\r\nRomance! Is it something always dead and gone, or something a man carries\r\naround with him?\r\n\r\nWhatever it is, the navy is there to try it out, and no danger of starving\r\nwhile we try it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA BABIES\r\n\r\n\r\nSubmarines have been cutting a large figure in this war. There is\r\nprobably a general curiosity to know how they are operated. I know I was\r\ncurious to know, and, _Collier's_ having secured me permission from the\r\nElectric Boat Company, I went over to Cape Cod to take in a trial trip\r\nor two of some boats they were building for the British Government.\r\n\r\nThere was one all ready for sea.\r\n\r\nLong and narrow, and modelled like a stretched-out egg she was, with one\r\nend of the egg running to a point by way of a stern, and the other\r\nflattened to an up-and-down wedge-like bow. A heavy black line marked\r\nher run.\r\n\r\nBelow her run she was tinted to the pale green of inshore waters, and to\r\na grayish blue above. Everything above her deck, which was only a raised\r\nfore-and-aft platform for the crew to walk on, with countless little\r\nround scupper-holes in its sides--above the deck her conning-tower, and\r\nabove that again her periscope casing--all were blue-gray.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the morning was of heavy wind and rain or snow to come;\r\nand a hard, cold breath of the sea and a taste of the rain were already\r\non us as we crossed the plank from the mother ship to the deck of the\r\n\"sub\" and, one after the other, fitted ourselves into the main hatchway\r\nand wiggled down into her.\r\n\r\nOur submarine, from the inside, was an amazing collection of engines,\r\ntanks, gauges, tubes, pipes, valves, wheels, torpedoes, tube heads,\r\nelectric registers, electric lights, and whatnot. A flat steel floor ran\r\nfrom the forward end to the engine-room aft. Between the floor and the\r\narched deck overhead were three heavy steel bulkheads with heavy steel\r\ndoors. A narrow iron skeleton ladder led up to her conning-tower; small\r\nsteel rungs bolted to the casing showed the way to a square after-deck\r\nhatch.\r\n\r\nWhen all the others of us were below, the captain came squeezing down\r\nfrom the conning-tower hatch and took his position at the periscope.\r\n\r\nTo the captain's left stood a man whose job it was to hold the sub to\r\nthe depth of water desired. This was the diving-rudder man, a most\r\nexpert one, we were told, who had been known to hold a submerged sub at\r\nfull speed to within six inches of one depth for two miles at a stretch.\r\nA thin brass scale and a curved tube of colored water with an air bubble\r\nin it helped out the diving-rudder man's calculations. The least\r\ndeviation of the sub's course from the horizontal and these two\r\ninstruments, lit up by electric lamps, showed it at once. There was a\r\nbig dial, with a long green hand, which also marked the depth of the\r\nsub; but that was an insensitive and rather slow-acting gauge--all right\r\nfor the crew to look at from half the length of the sub, but not fine or\r\nquick enough for the diving-rudder man.\r\n\r\nHe was the busy man while we were under water. The others could now and\r\nagain grab a moment of relaxation from their tenseness, but while the\r\nsub was moving the diving-rudder man never took his eyes off the little\r\nbrass scale with the electric light playing on it. Stop and consider\r\nthat our sub had only to get a downward inclination of ever so little\r\nwhile running hooked-up under water, and in no time she would be below\r\nher lowest safety depth of 200 feet, where the pressure is 7 tons to\r\nevery square foot of her hull. And should she collapse there would be no\r\npreliminary small leak by way of warning. She would go as an egg-shell\r\ngoes when you crush it in your palm. Plack!--like that--and it would be\r\nall over. Above this same middle compartment, the smallest and most\r\ncrowded of all, up through the grilled spaces of a steel grating, we\r\ncould see the wide feet and boot-legs of the man who held the ship to\r\nher compass course; and for a wheel, we knew, he was holding a little\r\nmetal lever about as long and thick as his middle finger, with a little\r\nblack ball about as big as the ball of his thumb on the end of it.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the foot of the conning-tower ladder stood the\r\nballast-tank man; and when the captain from the foot of his periscope\r\ngave the word--after first looking forward, aft, and to each side of him\r\nto see that all hands were at their proper stations--it was the\r\nballast-tank man who went violently at once into action. He grabbed a\r\nbig valve and gave it a twist; grabbed another and gave it a twist; and\r\nanother, and one more; and, standing near by, we could hear--or thought\r\nwe could--the in-rush of great waters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the engine-room of a submarine. The Diesel engines,\r\ndriven by crude petroleum, propel the ship on the surface. Electric\r\nmotors supply the power when running submerged.]\r\n\r\nA man got to wondering then what would happen if this chap got his\r\nvalves mixed. But a look around showed every lever and every valve,\r\neverything marked with its own name and number. Nothing was left\r\nunmarked--in deep-cut black lettering on brass plates generally, but\r\nhere and there colored-light signs, too. After another look at the\r\nmultiplicity of them, almost any man would agree that it is a good\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nBut to get back: the tank man has done his part and our sub is sinking.\r\nThere is no unusual feeling to inform a man she is sinking. Only for the\r\nstarting of the engines, the diving-rudder man getting busy, and the\r\nwide-faced gauge's long green finger beginning to walk around, a man who\r\ndidn't know could easily believe that the sub was still tied up alongside\r\nher supply-ship. But the long green finger is walking, and marking 5\r\nfeet, 10 feet, 11, 12, as it walks. At 16 feet the finger oscillates and\r\nstops, and to that depth our diving-rudder man holds her while she speeds\r\non for a mile or so.\r\n\r\nThat first little dash is by way of warming her up. The officer for\r\nwhose government this submarine was built is aboard. He now asks for a\r\ntorpedo demonstration. So two 1,500-pound dummy torpedoes are got ready,\r\nthe breeches to two of the four forward tubes opened, the torpedoes\r\nslipped in, the breeches closed. The bow caps are then opened.\r\n\r\nThe captain, during all this time, has never left the periscope, which--to\r\nhave it explained and over with--is no more than a long telescope set on\r\nend, with a reflecting mirror top and bottom. From the lower end of the\r\nperiscope project two brass arms, by means of which the skipper now swings\r\nthe periscope all the way around. In this way he is able to look at any\r\nquarter of the sea he pleases.\r\n\r\nRunning at the depth we were then, the periscope showing about six feet\r\nout of water, the captain at the periscope was, of course, the only man\r\nwho could see anything outside of her.\r\n\r\nThe captain gave the needful preliminary orders; and at the proper time,\r\nsighting through the periscope as he did so, he pressed the button of a\r\nlittle arrangement which he held, half concealed, in the palm of his\r\nhand. There was a soft explosion, a sort of woof!--and a torpedo was on\r\nthe way to a hypothetical enemy, with only the captain able to see that\r\nit reached its mark.\r\n\r\nAs the torpedo left the sub the rudder man gave her a \"down\" rudder,\r\nwhich was to offset the tendency of the sub to shoot her nose to the\r\nsurface; when the torpedo had gone the tank man turned on the\r\nair-pressure, which blew out what water had entered the torpedo chamber.\r\nBy and by the other torpedo was fired.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this trial run was to prove that she could run so many\r\nmiles an hour under water by the power of her storage-batteries alone.\r\nAnd soon she went at that. And no mild racket inside her then; for a\r\nsub's engine power and space are out of all proportion to her tonnage.\r\nNot to decrease the noise, the man to whom the trial meant most was\r\nstanding by with a stop-watch, and every half-minute or so he would yell\r\nat the top of his lungs, \"Go!\" or \"Hold!\" to the engineer, who was\r\nimprisoned in a narrow alleyway with engines to right and to left and\r\nbelow him. The engineer would look at a register and yell back at the\r\nmanager, who would then set some figures in a book and rush over to the\r\nman who was reckoning up the decreasing or increasing amperes or\r\nkilowatts or whatever they were of her storage-batteries, and set down\r\nmore figures; and if the boss had to yell his head off to make himself\r\nheard, be sure that the others had to yell even louder. Only on trial\r\ntrips, probably, where tests have to be proved, does all this yelling\r\nhappen; but the total effect was to make a shore-goer feel, not as if\r\nhe were in a ship under water, but rather in a subway section under\r\nconstruction, or some overdriven corner of some sort of night-working\r\nmachine-shop, or some other homelike place ashore. The bright electric\r\nlights helped out the machine-shop illusion.\r\n\r\nFor a time during the run the diving-rudder man had his troubles keeping\r\nher on a level, whereupon the skipper--an easy-going man ordinarily--jerked\r\nhis head away from his periscope and had a peek for the reason. Through\r\nthe forward bulkhead door he spied the torpedo man, who, feeling pleased,\r\nperhaps, at the successful execution of his part of the programme, was\r\nfox-trotting fore and aft for himself in his section of the ship. \"Would\r\nyou mind picking out one spot and staying on it?\" asked the skipper, at\r\nwhich the torpedo man took his camp-stool, picked out his one spot, and\r\nplanted himself on it, and piously read the stock-market quotations of a\r\nweek-old newspaper for the rest of the run.\r\n\r\nWhile this hour run--full speed, submerged--was in progress, a tickling\r\nin our throats set most of us to coughing. A naval constructor of note,\r\nwho was also a shark on chemistry, explained how this coughing was not\r\ncaused by the chill in the air, but by the particles of sulphuric acid\r\nthrown off by the action of the storage-batteries. These little particles,\r\nit seems, went travelling about in the air seeking a home--some place,\r\nany place where they could tuck in out of the way; but all the air homes\r\nbeing already occupied by other tenants--the usual ingredients or\r\ncomponents of the air--they could find no place to butt in; and so they\r\nwent around and about till innocent people like ourselves made a home for\r\nthem by breathing them in out of the way. After which explanation--yelled\r\nabove all the other noises--these sulphuric hoboes caused less suspicion\r\nand discomfort. It was good to hear that what we were swallowing was not\r\nthe chlorine of a hundred stories of fiction.\r\n\r\nThe sub had now to prove her diving qualities. So tanks were blown out\r\nand up she went to the surface again; and there, while she was resting\r\nlike a bird on the water, ballast-tanks were suddenly filled and down she\r\nwent. Down, down, down she went--the long green finger on the broad-faced\r\ngauge walking around at a fine clip. Dropping so--on an even keel, by the\r\nway--she gave out no sense of action such as a man gets on an aeroplane.\r\nFlying around in the air, you see what's doing every second. If anything\r\nhappens, you know you will see it coming, and--perhaps--going: your eyes,\r\nears, brains, and nerves prove things to you.\r\n\r\nBut action in a submarine lies largely in a man's imagination, unless he\r\nbe the periscope man; and even there, when she is completely submerged,\r\nhe sees no more than the others. However, a man did not need to have too\r\nmuch imagination to think of a few things as he looked at the long green\r\nfinger walking around: 30 feet, 40 feet, 50 feet--This particular\r\nobserver had no idea she could drop so fast; and as she dropped, he\r\ncould not help wondering how deep the ocean was around there--this in\r\ncase anything happened. Sixty feet, 70 feet--she was gathering great\r\nspeed by then, but at 82 feet she stopped--a pleasant thing to see. And\r\nthen, maybe to show it was no accident, she did it all over again. Did\r\nwe feel any difficulty in breathing during all this? We did not, nor\r\nduring the three to four hours we were under that morning. And let a man\r\nlisten to these submarine enthusiasts telling how they can live three or\r\nfour weeks on their compressed air, if they have to, without coming to\r\nthe surface! Only give them food enough, of course. And coffee--they\r\nhave an electric range to make the coffee. As it happened, they made\r\ncoffee for us--not that day, but next morning going home. It was good\r\ncoffee. The 82-foot-drop stunts were done with each of the crew at his\r\nstation, ready at any instant to check her.\r\n\r\nTo meet the further requirements our sub had to rise to the top, fill\r\nher tanks, let herself go, and then, by an automatic safety device,\r\nfetch up all by herself. So the tank man applied the air-pressure, blew\r\nhis tanks free of all water, closed his outer valves and brought her up.\r\nShe was now stretched out on the surface--not quite motionless, for the\r\nfirst of the breeze predicted the night before was on and we could feel\r\nthat she was rolling a little. A peek through the periscope while she\r\nwas up disclosed further evidence of the breeze--tossing white crests,\r\ntwo coasters hustling for harbor under short sail, an inbound fisherman\r\nwith reefed mainsail making great leaps for home. Looking through the\r\nperiscope so, it was easy enough to understand the feeling of power\r\nwhich might well come to the master of a submarine in war time. The sub\r\ncan be lying there--in dark or bright water will make no difference; on\r\nsuch a day no eye is going to discern the white bone of the moving\r\nperiscope; and he can be standing there, with a quick peek now and then\r\nto see what is going on above him; and by and by she can come swinging\r\nalong majestically in her arrogance and power--the greatest battleship\r\nafloat, with guns to level a great city, or the biggest and speediest\r\nship ever built--and he can be there and when he gets good and\r\nready--Woof! she's gone. War-ship or liner, she's gone and all aboard\r\ngone with her; and the submarine skipper can go along about his business\r\nof getting the next one.\r\n\r\nHowever, the automatic device was set for action at the required depth\r\nand the word given.\r\n\r\nIn this same middle compartment--the operating compartment of the\r\nship--was a man with the spiritual face of one who keeps lonely, intense\r\nvigils. He sat on a camp-stool, and his business seemed to be not ever\r\nto let his rapt gaze wander from several rows of gauges which were\r\nscrewed to the bulkhead before him. Since I first stepped down into the\r\nsub I had spotted him, and had been wondering if his ascetic look was\r\nborn with him or was a development of his job--whatever his job might\r\nbe. Now I learned what his job was. He was the man who stood by the\r\nautomatic safety devices. If anything happened to the regular gadgets\r\nand it was life or death to get her at once to the surface, he was the\r\nman who pressed a button, or moved a switch, or in some highly\r\nmechanical way applied the mysterious power which would get her safe to\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nThe skipper gave the word, the main ballast lad opened his outer valves,\r\nand down she started. We knew this, as always, by the moving green\r\nfinger on the wide-faced gauge. Downward she kept on going, and to a man\r\nnot too long shipmates with the creature she certainly did seem to be\r\ngoing down in a hurry. She was nearing the appointed depth; she made the\r\nappointed depth, and--went on by. \"What's this!\" said one observer to\r\nhimself, and directed an interested eye toward the saint-like lad on the\r\ncamp-stool.\r\n\r\nBut it was only for a few feet. The indicator slacked up, fluttered,\r\nstopped dead. And then--without the husky tank boy to lift a finger--we\r\nheard the rumph-h and rumbling of the valve-seats as the sea-water was\r\ndriven out of her ballast-tanks; and then up she started. Soon there she\r\nwas--did it all by herself--atop of the water. And the face of the young\r\nfellow of the automatic devices was like the face of the devout\r\nmissionary who has just put something over on the heathen.\r\n\r\nLater, when you express the feeling of almost holy comfort which these\r\nlittle automatic safety devices give you, the manager--the same with the\r\nstop-watch and the note-book--says, \"Puh! Look here,\" and sits down and\r\ndetails--drawing good working plans of them on a pad while he talks--three\r\ndifferent ways by which a submarine crew can beat the game should any\r\nevil happen to the ordinary and regular means of getting to the surface.\r\n\r\nShe has a turn at porpoising then; that is from a moderate depth the\r\ndiving-rudder man shoots her near enough to the surface for the captain\r\nto have a look through the periscope--a long-enough look to plot the\r\nenemy on a chart, but not long enough to give that enemy much of a\r\nchance to pick him up; and then under again. And then up for another\r\npeek; and quickly under again, the captain at the periscope taking each\r\ntime a fresh bearing of the enemy, who is supposed to be at some\r\ndistance and steaming at good speed. After two or three such quick\r\nsights, changing course after each sight, it will be time to discharge a\r\ntorpedo or two at her. And--the layman may note it--with expert men at\r\nthe periscope and diving-rudder, a porpoising sub can sight, discharge\r\nher torpedo, and dive--all within five seconds.\r\n\r\nSteaming back to harbor after our trial run that day, we caught the\r\nfirst rip of the gale which the gummed-over moon and the low barometer\r\nhad forecast the night before. It was too rough to tie her up to the\r\nsupply-ship, so the sub was anchored--they carry anchors too--a short\r\ndistance away, with three men left on her for an anchor watch, the idea\r\nbeing to take them off later for a hot meal. But after the rest of us\r\nwere safe and warm and well fed aboard the mother ship, the increasing\r\nwinds came bowling over the increasing seas, and the crew of the sub had\r\nto wait.\r\n\r\nAt intervals we could hear them emitting beseeching, doleful, disgusted\r\nmoans and shrieks and howls from her air-whistle. But it was too rough\r\nfor any little choo-choo boat to be battling around. It was 9.30 that\r\nnight before they could safely be taken off. They were a moderately\r\ngood-natured lot; but that was the blear-eyed trouble with making sub\r\ntrial trips with bad weather coming on--a man never knew about his\r\nregular meals.\r\n\r\nThe supply-ship was quite a little institution herself. Approaching her\r\nfrom shore the night before, her lights beneath the dull moon and thin,\r\ndrifting clouds had loomed up like a dancing-hall across the lonesome\r\nharbor waters. When we got aboard, we found her the relic of what had\r\nonce been a fine block of a three-masted coaster; but moored forward and\r\naft she was now, as if for all time, and no longer showing stout spars\r\nand weather-beaten canvas--nothing but two floors of white-painted\r\nboarding above her old bulwarks.\r\n\r\nShe was a boarding-place, a sort of club, for the crew and attendants,\r\nas well as a supply station for the submarines which in these New\r\nEngland waters were being tried out for one of the warring Powers.\r\nVoices and cigar-smoke as we stepped aboard, and more or less quiet\r\nbreathing, with partly closed and open living and sleeping rooms,\r\ndenoted that men were discussing, arguing, sleeping, and otherwise\r\npassing a normal evening. Looking farther, we saw that down in the\r\ninsides of her--where formerly she stowed noble freights of coal or\r\nlumber or, sometimes, hay and ice--were now a boiler and engine room,\r\nand a good, big repair-shop.\r\n\r\nThis night, while the gale came howling and the sea rolling and the\r\nsolid rain sweeping against the sober old sides of our supply-ship--on\r\nthis night, the finest kind to be sitting in a warm cabin, we sat and,\r\nwhile the smoke rolled high, aired our views of the real things in the\r\nworld; and the most real thing in the world just then being a submarine,\r\nwe got this:\r\n\r\n\"Danger? Of course, there's some danger. So is there danger in\r\nbank-fishing, in log-jamming down in Maine, in mining deep down, and in\r\naeroplaning.\r\n\r\n\"You want to get a sub right. A sub is a ship modelled different from\r\nmost ships, of course, and built stronger to stand pressure, but only a\r\nship, after all, with special tanks in her. She's on top of the water\r\nand wants to go down. Good. She fills her tanks and down she goes. She's\r\ndown and wants to come up. All right. She empties her tanks and up she\r\ncomes. She's got to. She couldn't stay down with her tanks empty if she\r\nwanted to--not unless she blew a hole in her side, or left her hatches\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\"Of course if her tanks don't work right! But we showed you three\r\ndifferent ways to-day how she can beat that game. And anyway, no matter\r\nwhat happens, unless you're cruising deep, it's only a few feet to the\r\ntop. Not like a crazy aeroplane a thousand feet up in the air! Something\r\nhappens in an aeroplane, and where are you? With a busted stay or bamboo\r\nstrut and you a mile in the air, where are you? Volplane? Maybe. But if\r\nyou didn't--down you'd come atumbling like a hoop out of the clouds.\r\nThat's 90 per cent--yes, maybe 99 per cent--of the submarine game: See\r\nthat everything is right mechanically with your sub, then get a competent\r\ncrew and--well, you're ready.\"\r\n\r\nThat is for the submariner's point of view. As for the danger from a\r\nshore-goer's point of view: Ashore we make the mistake, perhaps, of\r\nthinking of a submarine as a heavy, logy body fighting always for her\r\nlife beneath an unfriendly ocean; whereas she is a light-moving easily\r\ncontrolled creature cruising in a rather friendly element.\r\n\r\nThe ocean is always trying to lift her atop and not hold her under\r\nwater. A submarine could be sent under with a positive buoyancy so\r\nsmall--that is, with so little more than enough in her tanks to sink\r\nher--that an ordinary man standing on the sea bottom could catch her as\r\nshe came floating down and bounce her up and off merely by the strength\r\nof his arms. Consider a submarine under water as we would a toy balloon\r\nin the air, say. Weight that toy balloon so that it just falls to earth.\r\nKick that toy balloon and what does it do? Doesn't it bounce along, and\r\nafter a few feet fall easily down again, and up and on and down again?\r\n\r\nPicture a strong wind driving that toy balloon along the street, and the\r\nballoon, as it bumps along, meeting an obstacle: Will the balloon smash\r\nitself against the obstacle, or what will it do? What that balloon does\r\nis pretty much what a submarine would do if, while running along full\r\nspeed under water, she suddenly ran into shoal water. She would go\r\nbumping along on the bottom; and, meeting an obstacle, if not too high,\r\nshe would be more likely to bounce over it than to smash herself against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes they do run into things and fetch up?\r\n\r\nThat is right, they do. Let our naval men tell of the old C plunger--the\r\nfirst class of sub in our navy--which hit an excursion steamer down the\r\nJames River way one time. She was a wooden steamer about 150 feet long,\r\nand the C's bow went clear through the steamer's sides. The steamer's\r\nengineer was sitting by his levers, reading the sporting page of his\r\nfavorite daily, when he heard a crash and found himself on the\r\nengine-room floor. Looking around, he saw a wedge of steel sticking\r\nthrough the side of his ship. He did not know what it was, but he could\r\nsee right away it didn't have a friendly look; so he hopscotched across\r\nthe engine-room floor and up a handy ladder to the deck, taking his\r\nassistant along in his wake. After rescuing the passengers it took three\r\ntugboats to pry sub and steamer apart.\r\n\r\nOur C boat must have hit her a pretty good wallop, for as they fell\r\napart the steamer sank. They ran the little old C up to the navy-yard to\r\nsee how much she was damaged. Surely after that smash she must be shaken\r\nup--her bow torpedo-tubes at least must be out of alignment! But not a\r\nthing wrong anywhere; they didn't even have to put her in dry dock. Out\r\nand about her business she went next morning.\r\n\r\nLater another of the same class came nosing up out of the depths, and\r\nbumped head on and into a breakwater down that same country--a solid\r\nstone wall of a breakwater. What did she do? She bounced off, and, after\r\na look around, also went on about her business.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the morning our sub up-anchored for her run across the open bay. On\r\nthe conning-tower was rigged a little bridge of slim brass stanchions\r\nand thin wire-rope rail, with the canvas as high as a man's chin for\r\nprotection; and away she went in a wind that was still blowing hard\r\nenough to drive home-bound Gloucester fishermen down to storm trysails\r\nand sea enough to jump an out-bound destroyer of a thousand tons under\r\neasy steam to her lower plates whenever she lifted forward.\r\n\r\nThere was not a soul standing around on the main deck of the destroyer\r\nas we passed her, nor on her high forward turtle-deck, which was being\r\nwashed clean; and surely not much comfort being bounced around on\r\ntransoms in that destroyer below, nor too much dryness on her flying\r\nbridge. And yet here was our little sub--full speed and all--heading\r\nstraight into high-curling seas and making fine weather of it.\r\n\r\nPlunging her bow under, and through she'd go; and when she did the seas\r\nwould go swashing up atop of her make-believe deck and come rolling down\r\nher round-top plates and squishing through the hundreds of round holes\r\nin her deck sides. But steady? Up on her little bridge we did not half\r\nthe time have to hold on to her little steel-rope rail lines to keep our\r\nbalance. She kept on going, hooked-up all the way, seas and wind and all\r\nto hinder her, and finished her five-hour run without so much as wetting\r\nour coat fronts up on the conning-tower bridge. A great little sea\r\nboat--a submarine.\r\n\r\nNow for the personnel of the crew. The crew of the sub described were\r\nnot sailors. The captain was an old seagoer--yes; and it would be a safe\r\nguess that the diving-rudder man had a seagoing experience; and one\r\nother perhaps; but the fellows who stood by the other things below came\r\nstraight from the boat works. They had helped, most of them, to build\r\nher: which was one good reason for having them along on her trial trip.\r\n\r\nAnd there are thousands of young fellows working around garages and in\r\nmachine-shops and electric-light plants ashore who are the very men\r\nneeded for submarines. There will always have to be a sailor or two in a\r\nsubmarine; or there should be, for a real sailor is always a handy man\r\nto have around--he knows things that nobody else knows.\r\n\r\nAnd so, if hanging around there are any young fellows with a taste for\r\nadventure and a trend for naval warfare, these submarines look to be the\r\nthing. They are only little fellows now, and, as they stand to-day,\r\nlimited as to range and power of offense, but stay by and grow up with\r\nthem, and by and by be with them when they will be as big as the\r\nbattleships and of a radius of action that will stretch from here\r\nto--well, as far as they like; drawing their energy from the sun above\r\nthem, or the sea-tides about them, and not having to see enemy ships to\r\nbe able to fight them--equipped with devices not now invented but which\r\nwill serve to feel those other ships and, feeling them, to plot their\r\ndirection and distance!\r\n\r\nImagine a fleet of those lads battling under water some day--allowing no\r\nsurface craft to live--feeling each other out and plotting direction and\r\ndistance as they feel, and then letting go broadsides of torpedoes ten\r\nor a hundred times as powerful as anything we now have; and at the same\r\ntime the air full of war-planes battling above them.\r\n\r\nInfants, sea babies, is what they are to-day. But wait till they grow\r\nup!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\n   Typographical errors corrected:\r\n\r\n      Page 84: changed ay to aye\r\n\r\n      Page 191: moved quotes from end of paragraph to end of quote\r\n\r\n      Page 202: changed serivce to service\r\n\r\n      Page 208: changed underguard to under guard\r\n\r\n      Page 253: added missing word \"to\" after \"evil happen.\"",
