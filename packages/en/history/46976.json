J. CHINNOCK, M.A., LL.B., LONDON,\r\n\r\n  _Rector of Dumfries Academy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  London:\r\n\r\n  HODDER AND STOUGHTON,\r\n\r\n  27, PATERNOSTER ROW.\r\n\r\n  MDCCCLXXXIV.\r\n\r\n  Butler & Tanner,\r\n  The Selwood Printing Works,\r\n  Frome, and London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I began this Translation, more than two years ago, I had no\r\nintention of publishing it; but as the work progressed, it occurred\r\nto me that Arrian is an Author deserving of more attention from the\r\nEnglish-speaking races than he has yet received. No edition of his\r\nworks has, so far as I am aware, ever appeared in England, though on\r\nthe Continent many have been published. In the following Translation I\r\nhave tried to give as literal a rendering of the Greek text as I could\r\nwithout transgressing the idioms of our own language. My theory of the\r\nduty of a Translator is, to give the _ipsissima verba_ of his Author\r\nas nearly as possible, and not put into his mouth words which he never\r\nused, under the mistaken notion of improving his diction or his way of\r\nstating his case. It is a comparatively easy thing to give a paraphrase\r\nof a foreign work, presenting the general drift of the original; but no\r\none, unless he has himself tried it, can understand the difficulty of\r\ntranslating a classical Author correctly without omission or mutilation.\r\n\r\nIn the Commentary which I have compiled, continual reference has been\r\nmade to the other extant authorities on the history of Alexander,\r\nsuch as Diodorus, Plutarch, Curtius, Justin, and Aelian; so that I\r\nthink I may safely assert that, taking the Translation and the Notes\r\ntogether, the book forms a complete history of Alexander’s reign. Much\r\ngeographical and other material has also been gathered from Herodotus,\r\nStrabo, Pliny, and Ammianus; and the allusions to the places which are\r\nalso mentioned in the Old Testament are given from the Hebrew.\r\n\r\nAs Arrian lived in the second century of the present era, and nearly\r\nfive hundred years after Demosthenes, it is not to be expected that he\r\nwrote classical Greek. There are, however, at least a dozen valuable\r\nGreek authors of this century whose works are still extant, and of\r\nthese it is a safe statement to make, that Arrian is the best of them\r\nall, with the single exception of Lucian. I have noticed as many of his\r\ndeviations from Attic Greek constructions as I thought suitable to a\r\nwork of this kind. A complete index of Proper Names has been added, and\r\nthe quantities of the vowels marked for the aid of the English Reader.\r\nIn the multiplicity of references which I have put into the Notes, I\r\nshould be sanguine if I imagined that no errors will be found; but if\r\nsuch occur, I must plead as an excuse the pressure of work which a\r\nteacher in a large school experiences, leaving him very little energy\r\nfor literary labour.\r\n\r\n  E.

We learn from Suidas that Dion Cassius wrote a biography of\r\nArrian; but this work is not extant. Flavius Arrianus was born near\r\nthe end of the first century of the Christian era, at Nicomedia, the\r\ncapital of Bithynia. He became a pupil of the famous Stoic philosopher\r\nEpictetus, and afterwards went to Athens, where he received the surname\r\nof the “younger Xenophon,” from the fact that he occupied the same\r\nrelation to Epictetus as Xenophon did to Socrates.[1] Not only was he\r\ncalled Xenophon by others, but he calls himself so in _Cynegeticus_ (v.\r\n6); and in _Periplus_ (xii. 5; xxv. 1), he distinguishes Xenophon by\r\nthe addition _the elder_. Lucian (_Alexander_, 56) calls Arrian simply\r\n_Xenophon_. During the stay of the emperor Hadrian at Athens, A.D. 126,\r\nArrian gained his friendship. He accompanied his patron to Rome, where\r\nhe received the Roman citizenship. In consequence of this, he assumed\r\nthe name of Flavius.[2] In the same way the Jewish historian, Josephus,\r\nhad been allowed by Vespasian and Titus to bear the imperial name\r\nFlavius.[3]\r\n\r\nPhotius says, that Arrian had a distinguished career in Rome, being\r\nentrusted with various political offices, and at last reaching the\r\nsupreme dignity of consul under Antoninus Pius.[4] Previous to this\r\nhe was appointed (A.D. 132) by Hadrian, Governor of Cappadocia, which\r\nprovince was soon after invaded by the Alani, or Massagetae, whom he\r\ndefeated and expelled.[5] When Marcus Aurelius came to the throne,\r\nArrian withdrew into private life and returned to his native city,\r\nNicomedia. Here, according to Photius, he was appointed priest to\r\nDemeter and Persephone. He died in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.\r\n\r\nThe earlier literary efforts of Arrian were philosophical. After\r\nthe expulsion of the philosophers from Rome, by Domitian, Epictetus\r\ndelivered his lectures at Nicopolis, in Epirus, where it is probable\r\nthat Arrian was his pupil.\r\n\r\nI. These lectures were published by Arrian, under the title of\r\n_Discourses of Epictetus_, in eight books, the first four only of which\r\nhave come down to us. He tells us himself in the introduction to this\r\nwork, that he strove as far as possible to preserve the very words\r\nof his teacher as mementoes of his method of reasoning and diction.\r\nGellius (xix. 1) speaks of a fifth book of these Discourses.\r\n\r\nII. He also compiled _The Enchiridion of Epictetus_, an abstract of\r\nthe philosophy of Epictetus, which is still extant. This manual of\r\nthe Stoic moral philosophy was very popular, both among Pagans and\r\nChristians, for many centuries.\r\n\r\nIII. Another work by Arrian, in twelve books, distinct from the above,\r\nis mentioned by Photius under the title of “Ὁμιλίαι Ἐπικτήτου”,\r\nor _Friendly Conversations with Epictetus_. Of this only a few\r\nfragments survive.\r\n\r\nIV. Another lost work of Arrian on the life and death of Epictetus\r\nis mentioned by Simplicius in the beginning of his Commentary on the\r\nEnchiridion.\r\n\r\nV. Besides editing these philosophical works, Arrian wrote many\r\noriginal books. By far the most important of these is the _Anabasis of\r\nAlexander_, or the History of Alexander the Great’s Campaigns. This\r\nis one of the most authentic and accurate of historical works. Though\r\ninspired with admiration for his hero, the author evinces impartiality\r\nand freedom from hero-worship. He exhibits great literary acuteness in\r\nthe choice of his authorities and in sifting evidence. The two chief\r\nsources from which he drew his narrative were the histories written by\r\nPtolemy, son of Lagus, and Aristobulus, son of Aristobulus, both of\r\nwhom were officers in Alexander’s army. Other authorities quoted by\r\nArrian himself were:—Eratosthenes, Megasthenes, Nearchus, Aristus,\r\nand Asclepiades. He also made use of Alexander’s letters, which he\r\nmentions five times;[6] only once, however, quoting the exact words of\r\nthe writer. The last authority which he mentions, is the _Royal Diary_\r\nkept by Eumenes, of Cardia, the private secretary of Philip as well as\r\nof Alexander, and by the historian Diodotus, of Erythrae. It is used by\r\nArrian only once,[7] as it is by Plutarch.[8]\r\n\r\nVI. The work named _Indica_, is a description of India, and was usually\r\nunited in manuscripts with the Anabasis, as an eighth book. Though\r\nit may be looked upon as a supplement to the Anabasis, Arrian often\r\nrefers in the one work to the other.[9] From this we may infer that the\r\nauthor wished the _Indica_ to be considered a distinct book from the\r\nAnabasis; and from the remark in Anab. v. 1, it is clear that it was\r\ncomposed after the Anabasis. This book is written in the Ionic dialect,\r\nlike the History of Herodotus and the Indica of Ctesias. The latter\r\nuntrustworthy book Arrian wished to supplant by his own narrative,\r\nprincipally based on the works of Megasthenes and Nearchus.\r\n\r\nVII. Photius mentions among Arrian’s historical works:—_The Events\r\nafter Alexander_, in ten books, which gives the history of Alexander’s\r\nsuccessors. Photius (cod. 92) has preserved many extracts from this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nVIII. _Bithynica_ in eight books, a work often quoted by Eustathius in\r\nhis commentaries to the Iliad and to Dionysius Periegetes. In regard\r\nto the contents of this book, Photius (cod. 93) says:—“The Bithynica\r\ncommences from the mythical events of history and comes down as far\r\nas the death of the last Nicomedes, who at his death bequeathed his\r\nkingdom to the Romans, who had never been ruled by a king after the\r\nexpulsion of Tarquin.”\r\n\r\nIX. _Parthica_, in seventeen books. See Photius (cod. 58).\r\n\r\nX. _History of the Alani_. See Photius (cod. 93). Only fragments of\r\nthis and the _Parthica_ remain.\r\n\r\nXI. Besides the large works, we learn from Photius (cod. 93) that\r\nArrian wrote the biographies of the Corinthian Timoleon and of the\r\nSyracusan Dion. Lucian (Alex. 2), also states that he wrote the life of\r\nTilliborus, the notorious robber of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nXII. A valuable geographical work by Arrian has come down to us, called\r\n“Περίπλους πόντου Εὐξείνου”, a description of a voyage round the coasts\r\nof the Euxine. This naval expedition was executed by him as Governor\r\nof Cappadocia. The Alani, or, Albani of the East, a tribe related to\r\nthe Massagetae, were threatening to invade his province, and he made\r\nthis voyage with a view of fortifying the most important strategic\r\npoints on the coast. From section 26 of the Periplus we find that this\r\nvoyage must have taken place about the year 131 or 132 A.D.; for the\r\ndeath of King Cotys II., noticed in that passage as just dead, is\r\nproved by Böckh’s investigations to have occurred in 131 A.D. Two other\r\ngeographical works, _The Periplus of the Red Sea_ and _The Periplus of\r\nthe Euxine_, formerly ascribed to Arrian, are proved to belong to a\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\nXIII. A work on _Tactics_, composed 137 A.D. In many parts this book\r\nagrees nearly verbally with the larger work of Aelian on the same\r\nsubject; but Leo Tacticus (vii. 85) expressly mentions the two works as\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nXIV. _An Array of Battle against the Alani_, is a fragment discovered\r\nin the seventeenth century in the Description of his Battles with the\r\nAlani, who invaded his province, probably 137 A.D., as Arrian had\r\npreviously feared.[10]\r\n\r\nXV. A small work by Arrian on the Chase, forms a supplement to\r\nXenophon’s book on the same subject. It is entitled _Cynegeticus of\r\nArrian or the second Xenophon the Athenian_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best editions of the Anabasis are the following:—The _editio\r\nprinceps_ by Trincavelli, Venice, 1535; Gerbel, Strassburg, 1539; Henri\r\nEstienne, 1575; N. Blancardus, Amsterdam, 1668; J. Gronovius, Leyden,\r\n1704; G. Raphelius, Amsterdam, 1757; A. C. Borkeck, Lemgovia, 1792;\r\nF. Schmieder, Leipzig, 1798; Tauchnitz edition, Leipzig, 1818; J. O.\r\nEllendt, Königsberg, 1832; C. W. Krüger, Berlin, 1835; F. Dübner,\r\nParis, 1846; K. Abicht, Leipzig, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIAN’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have admitted into my narrative as strictly authentic all the\r\nstatements relating to Alexander and Philip which Ptolemy, son of\r\nLagus,[11] and Aristobulus, son of Aristobulus,[12] agree in making;\r\nand from those statements which differ I have selected that which\r\nappears to me the more credible and at the same time the more\r\ndeserving of record. Different authors have given different accounts\r\nof Alexander’s life; and there is no one about whom more have\r\nwritten, or more at variance with each other. But in my opinion the\r\nnarratives of Ptolemy and Aristobulus are more worthy of credit than\r\nthe rest; Aristobulus, because he served under king Alexander in his\r\nexpedition, and Ptolemy, not only because he accompanied Alexander in\r\nhis expedition, but also because he was himself a king afterwards, and\r\nfalsification of facts would have been more disgraceful to him than to\r\nany other man. Moreover, they are both more worthy of credit, because\r\nthey compiled their histories after Alexander’s death, when neither\r\ncompulsion was used nor reward offered them to write anything different\r\nfrom what really occurred. Some statements made by other writers I\r\nhave incorporated in my narrative, because they seemed to me worthy of\r\nmention and not altogether improbable; but I have given them merely as\r\nreports of Alexander’s proceedings. And if any man wonders why, after\r\nso many other men have written of Alexander, the compilation of this\r\nhistory came into my mind, after perusing[13] the narratives of all the\r\nrest, let him read this of mine, and then wonder (if he can).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANABASIS OF ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF PHILIP AND ACCESSION OF ALEXANDER.—HIS WARS WITH THE\r\nTHRACIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that Philip died[14] when Pythodemus was archon at\r\nAthens,[15] and that his son Alexander,[16] being then about twenty\r\nyears of age, marched into Peloponnesus[17] as soon as he had secured\r\nthe regal power. There he assembled all the Greeks who were within the\r\nlimits of Peloponnesus,[18] and asked from them the supreme command of\r\nthe expedition against the Persians, an office which they had already\r\nconferred upon Philip. He received the honour which he asked from all\r\nexcept the Lacedaemonians,[19] who replied that it was an hereditary\r\ncustom of theirs, not to follow others but to lead them. The Athenians\r\nalso attempted to bring about some political change; but they were\r\nso alarmed at the very approach of Alexander, that they conceded to\r\nhim even more ample public honours than those which had been bestowed\r\nupon Philip.[20] He then returned into Macedonia and busied himself in\r\npreparing for the expedition into Asia.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the approach of spring (B.C. 335), he marched towards\r\nThrace, into the lands of the Triballians and Illyrians,[21] because\r\nhe ascertained that these nations were meditating a change of policy;\r\nand at the same time, as they were lying on his frontier, he thought\r\nit inexpedient, when he was about to start on a campaign so far away\r\nfrom his own land, to leave them behind him without being entirely\r\nsubjugated. Setting out then from Amphipolis, he invaded the land of\r\nthe people who were called independent Thracians,[22] keeping the\r\ncity of Philippi and mount Orbelus on the left. Crossing the river\r\nNessus,[23] they say he arrived at mount Haemus[24] on the tenth day.\r\nHere, along the defiles up the ascent to the mountain, he was met by\r\nmany of the traders equipped with arms, as well as by the independent\r\nThracians, who had made preparations to check the further advance of\r\nhis expedition by seizing the summit of the Haemus, along which was the\r\nroute for the passage of his army. They had collected their waggons,\r\nand placed them in front of them, not only using them as a rampart\r\nfrom which they might defend themselves, in case they should be forced\r\nback, but also intending to let them loose upon the phalanx of the\r\nMacedonians, where the mountain was most precipitous, if they tried to\r\nascend. They had come to the conclusion[25] that the denser the phalanx\r\nwas with which the waggons rushing down came into collision, the more\r\neasily would they scatter it by the violence of their fall upon it.\r\n\r\nBut Alexander formed a plan by which he might cross the mountain with\r\nthe least danger possible; and since he was resolved to run all risks,\r\nknowing that there were no means of passing elsewhere, he ordered the\r\nheavy-armed soldiers, as soon as the waggons began to rush down the\r\ndeclivity, to open their ranks, and directed that those whom the road\r\nwas sufficiently wide to permit to do so should stand apart, so that\r\nthe waggons might roll through the gap; but that those who were hemmed\r\nin on all sides should either stoop down together or even fall flat\r\non the ground, and lock their shields compactly together, so that the\r\nwaggons rushing down upon them, and in all probability by their very\r\nimpetus leaping over them, might pass on without injuring them. And it\r\nturned out just as Alexander had conjectured and exhorted. For some\r\nof the men made gaps in the phalanx, and others locked their shields\r\ntogether. The waggons rolled over the shields without doing much\r\ninjury, not a single man being killed under them. Then the Macedonians\r\nregained their courage, inasmuch as the waggons, which they had\r\nexcessively dreaded, had inflicted no damage upon them. With a loud\r\ncry they assaulted the Thracians. Alexander ordered his archers to\r\nmarch from the right wing in front of the rest of the phalanx, because\r\nthere the passage was easier, and to shoot at the Thracians where they\r\nadvanced. He himself took his own guard, the shield-bearing infantry\r\nand the Agrianians,[26] and led them to the left. Then the archers\r\nshot at the Thracians who sallied forward, and repulsed them; and\r\nthe phalanx, coming to close fighting, easily drove away from their\r\nposition men who were light-armed and badly equipped barbarians. The\r\nconsequence was, they no longer waited to receive Alexander marching\r\nagainst them from the left, but casting away their arms they fled down\r\nthe mountain as each man best could. About 1,500 of them were killed;\r\nbut only a few were taken prisoners on account of their swiftness of\r\nfoot and acquaintance with the country. However, all the women who were\r\naccompanying them were captured, as were also their children and all\r\ntheir booty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nBATTLE WITH THE TRIBALLIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander sent the booty away southward to the cities on the\r\nseashore,[27] entrusting to Lysanias and Philotas[28] the duty of\r\nsetting it up for sale. But he himself crossed the summit, and\r\nadvancing through the Haemus into the land of the Triballians, he\r\narrived at the river Lyginus.[29] This river is distant from the\r\nIster[30] three days’ march to one intending to go to the Haemus.\r\nSyrmus, king of the Triballians, hearing of Alexander’s expedition long\r\nbefore, had sent the women and children of the nation on in advance\r\nto the Ister, ordering them to pass over into one of the islands in\r\nthat river, the name of which was Peuce.[31] To this island also the\r\nThracians, whose territories were conterminous with those of the\r\nTriballians, had fled together for refuge at the approach of Alexander.\r\nSyrmus himself likewise, accompanied by his train, had fled for refuge\r\nto the same place. But the main body of the Triballians fled back to\r\nthe river, from which Alexander had started the day before.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard of their starting, he wheeled round again, and, marching\r\nagainst them, surprised them just as they were encamping. And those\r\nwho were surprised drew themselves up in battle array in a woody glen\r\nalong the bank of the river. Alexander drew out his phalanx into a\r\ndeep column, and led it on in person. He also ordered the archers\r\nand slingers to run forward and discharge arrows and stones at the\r\nbarbarians, hoping to provoke them by this to come out of the woody\r\nglen into the ground unencumbered with trees. When they were within\r\nreach of the missiles, and were struck by them, they rushed out\r\nagainst the archers, who were undefended by shields, with the purpose\r\nof fighting them hand-to-hand. But when Alexander had drawn them thus\r\nout of the woody glen, he ordered Philotas to take the cavalry which\r\ncame from upper Macedonia, and to charge their right wing, where they\r\nhad advanced furthest in their sally. He also commanded Heraclides and\r\nSopolis[32] to lead on the cavalry which came from Bottiaea[33] and\r\nAmphipolis against the left wing; while he himself extended the phalanx\r\nof infantry and the rest of the horse in front of the phalanx and\r\nled them against the enemy’s centre. And indeed as long as there was\r\nonly skirmishing on both sides, the Triballians did not get the worst\r\nof it; but as soon as the phalanx in dense array attacked them with\r\nvigour, and the cavalry fell upon them in various quarters, no longer\r\nmerely striking them with the javelin, but pushing them with their very\r\nhorses, then at length they turned and fled through the woody glen to\r\nthe river. Three thousand were slain in the flight; few of them were\r\ntaken prisoners, both because there was a dense wood in front of the\r\nriver, and the approach of night deprived the Macedonians of certainty\r\nin their pursuit. Ptolemy says, that of the Macedonians themselves\r\neleven horsemen and about forty foot soldiers were killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER AT THE DANUBE AND IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GETAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the battle, Alexander reached the river Ister,\r\nwhich is the largest of all the rivers in Europe, traverses a very\r\ngreat tract of country, and separates very warlike nations. Most of\r\nthese belong to the Celtic race,[34] in whose territory the sources\r\nof the river take their rise. Of these nations the remotest are the\r\nQuadi[35] and Marcomanni[36]; then the Iazygians,[37] a branch of\r\nthe Sauromatians[38]; then the Getae,[39] who hold the doctrine of\r\nimmortality; then the main body of the Sauromatians; and, lastly, the\r\nScythians,[40] whose land stretches as far as the outlets of the river,\r\nwhere through five mouths it discharges its water into the Euxine\r\nSea.[41] Here Alexander found some ships of war which had come to him\r\nfrom Byzantium, through the Euxine Sea and up the river. Filling these\r\nwith archers and heavy-armed troops, he sailed to the island to which\r\nthe Triballians and Thracians had fled for refuge. He tried to force a\r\nlanding; but the barbarians came to meet him at the brink of the river,\r\nwhere the ships were making the assault. But these were only few in\r\nnumber, and the army in them small. The shores of the island, also,\r\nwere in most places too steep and precipitous for landing, and the\r\ncurrent of the river alongside it, being, as it were, shut up into a\r\nnarrow channel by the nearness of the banks, was rapid and exceedingly\r\ndifficult to stem.\r\n\r\nAlexander therefore led back his ships, and determined to cross the\r\nIster and march against the Getae, who dwelt on the other side of that\r\nriver; for he observed that many of them had collected on the bank of\r\nthe river for the purpose of barring his way, if he should cross. There\r\nwere of them about 4,000 cavalry and more than 10,000 infantry. At\r\nthe same time a strong desire seized him to advance beyond the Ister.\r\nHe therefore went on board the fleet himself. He also filled with hay\r\nthe hides which served them as tent-coverings, and collected from the\r\ncountry around all the boats made from single trunks of trees. Of these\r\nthere was a great abundance, because the people who dwell near the\r\nIster use them for fishing in the river, sometimes also for journeying\r\nto each other for traffic up the river; and most of them carry on\r\npiracy with them. Having collected as many of these as he could, upon\r\nthem he conveyed across as many of his soldiers as was possible in such\r\na fashion. Those who crossed with Alexander amounted in number to 1,500\r\ncavalry and 4,000 infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER DESTROYS THE CITY OF THE GETAE.—THE AMBASSADORS OF THE CELTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey crossed over by night to a spot where the corn stood high; and in\r\nthis way they reached the bank more secretly. At the approach of dawn\r\nAlexander led his men through the field of standing corn, ordering the\r\ninfantry to lean upon the corn with their pikes[42] held transversely,\r\nand thus to advance into the untilled ground. As long as the phalanx\r\nwas advancing through the standing corn, the cavalry followed; but\r\nwhen they marched out of the tilled land, Alexander himself led the\r\nhorse round to the right wing, and commanded Nicanor[43] to lead the\r\nphalanx in a square. The Getae did not even sustain the first charge\r\nof the cavalry; for Alexander’s audacity seemed incredible to them,\r\nin having thus easily crossed the Ister, the largest of rivers, in a\r\nsingle night, without throwing a bridge over the stream. Terrible to\r\nthem also was the closely-locked order of the phalanx, and violent\r\nthe charge of the cavalry. At first they fled for refuge into their\r\ncity, which was distant about a parasang[44] from the Ister; but when\r\nthey saw that Alexander was leading his phalanx carefully along the\r\nriver, to prevent his infantry being anywhere surrounded by the Getae\r\nlying in ambush; whereas he was leading his cavalry straight on, they\r\nagain abandoned the city, because it was badly fortified. They carried\r\noff as many of their women and children as their horses could carry,\r\nand betook themselves into the steppes, in a direction which led as\r\nfar as possible from the river. Alexander took the city and all the\r\nbooty which the Getae left behind. This he gave to Meleager[45] and\r\nPhilip[46] to carry off. After razing the city to the ground, he\r\noffered sacrifice upon the bank of the river, to Zeus the preserver,\r\nto Heracles,[47] and to Ister himself, because he had allowed him to\r\ncross; and while it was still day he brought all his men back safe to\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nThere ambassadors came to him from Syrmus, king of the Triballians,\r\nand from the other independent nations dwelling near the Ister. Some\r\neven arrived from the Celts who dwelt near the Ionian gulf.[48] These\r\npeople are of great stature, and of a haughty disposition. All the\r\nenvoys said that they had come to seek Alexander’s friendship. To all\r\nof them he gave pledges of amity, and received pledges from them in\r\nreturn. He then asked the Celts what thing in the world caused them\r\nspecial alarm, expecting that his own great fame had reached the Celts\r\nand had penetrated still further, and that they would say that they\r\nfeared him most of all things. But the answer of the Celts turned out\r\nquite contrary to his expectation; for, as they dwelt so far away from\r\nAlexander, inhabiting districts difficult of access, and as they saw he\r\nwas about to set out in another direction, they said they were afraid\r\nthat the sky would some time or other fall down upon them. These men\r\nalso he sent back, calling them friends, and ranking them as allies,\r\nmaking the remark that the Celts were braggarts.[49]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nREVOLT OF CLITUS AND GLAUCIAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then advanced into the land of the Agrianians and Paeonians,[50]\r\nwhere messengers reached him, who reported that Clitus, son of\r\nBardylis,[51] had revolted, and that Glaucias,[52] king of the\r\nTaulantians,[53] had gone over to him. They also reported that the\r\nAutariatians[54] intended to attack him on his way. He accordingly\r\nresolved to commence his march without delay. But Langarus, king of the\r\nAgrianians, who, in the lifetime of Philip, had been an open and avowed\r\nfriend of Alexander, and had gone on an embassy to him in his private\r\ncapacity, at that time also came to him with the finest and best armed\r\nof the shield-bearing troops, which he kept as a body-guard. When this\r\nman heard that Alexander was inquiring who the Autariatians were, and\r\nwhat was the number of their men, he said that he need take no account\r\nof them, since they were the least warlike of the tribes of that\r\ndistrict; and that he would himself make an inroad into their land, so\r\nthat they might have too much occupation about their own affairs to\r\nattack others. Accordingly, at Alexander’s order, he made an attack\r\nupon them; and not only did he attack them, but he swept their land\r\nclean of captives and booty. Thus the Autariatians were indeed occupied\r\nwith their own affairs. Langarus was rewarded by Alexander with the\r\ngreatest honours, and received from him the gifts which were considered\r\nmost valuable in the eyes of the king of the Macedonians. Alexander\r\nalso promised to give him his sister Cyna[55] in marriage when he\r\narrived at Pella.[56] But Langarus fell ill and died on his return home.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Alexander marched along the river Erigon,[57] and proceeded\r\nto the city of Pelium;[58] for Clitus had seized this city, as it was\r\nthe strongest in the country. When Alexander arrived at this place,\r\nand had encamped near the river Eordaicus,[59] he resolved to make an\r\nassault upon the wall the next day. But Clitus held the mountains which\r\nencircled the city, and commanded it from their height; moreover, they\r\nwere covered with dense thickets. His intention was to fall upon the\r\nMacedonians from all sides, if they assaulted the city. But Glaucias,\r\nking of the Taulantians, had not yet joined him. Alexander, however,\r\nled his forces towards the city; and the enemy, after sacrificing three\r\nboys, an equal number of girls, and three black rams, sallied forth for\r\nthe purpose of receiving the Macedonians in a hand-to-hand conflict.\r\nBut as soon as they came to close quarters, they left the positions\r\nwhich they had occupied, strong as they were,[60] in such haste that\r\neven their sacrificial victims were captured still lying on the ground.\r\n\r\nOn this day he shut them up in the city, and encamping near the wall,\r\nhe resolved to intercept them by a circumvallation; but on the next\r\nday Glaucias, king of the Taulantians, arrived with a great force.\r\nThen, indeed, Alexander gave up the hope of capturing the city with\r\nhis present force, since many warlike troops had fled for refuge\r\ninto it, and Glaucias with his large army would be likely to follow\r\nhim up closely if he assailed the wall. But he sent Philotas on a\r\nforaging expedition, with the beasts of burden from the camp and a\r\nsufficient body of cavalry to serve as a guard. When Glaucias heard\r\nof the expedition of Philotas he marched out to meet him, and seized\r\nthe mountains which surrounded the plain, from which Philotas intended\r\nto procure forage. As soon as Alexander was informed that his cavalry\r\nand beasts of burden would be in danger if night overtook them, taking\r\nthe shield-bearing troops,[61] the archers, the Agrianians, and about\r\nfour hundred cavalry, he went with all speed to their aid. The rest of\r\nthe army he left behind near the city, to prevent the citizens from\r\nhastening forth to form a junction with Glaucias (as they would have\r\ndone), if all the Macedonian army had withdrawn. Directly Glaucias\r\nperceived that Alexander was advancing, he evacuated the mountains,\r\nand Philotas and his forces returned to the camp in safety. But Clitus\r\nand Glaucias still imagined that they had caught Alexander in a\r\ndisadvantageous position; for they were occupying the mountains, which\r\ncommanded the plain by their height, with a large body of cavalry,\r\njavelin-throwers, and slingers, besides a considerable number of\r\nheavy-armed infantry. Moreover, the men who had been beleaguered in\r\nthe city were expected to pursue the Macedonians closely if they made\r\na retreat. The ground also through which Alexander had to march was\r\nevidently narrow and covered with wood; on one side it was hemmed in by\r\na river, and on the other there was a very lofty and craggy mountain,\r\nso that there would not be room for the army to pass, even if only four\r\nshield-bearers marched abreast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF CLITUS AND GLAUCIAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Alexander drew up his army in such a way that the depth of the\r\nphalanx was 120 men; and stationing 200 cavalry on each wing, he\r\nordered them to preserve silence, in order to receive the word of\r\ncommand quickly. Accordingly he gave the signal to the heavy-armed\r\ninfantry in the first place to hold their spears erect, and then to\r\ncouch them at the concerted sign; at one time to incline their spears\r\nto the right, closely locked together, and at another time towards\r\nthe left. He then set the phalanx itself into quick motion forward,\r\nand marched it towards the wings, now to the right, and then to the\r\nleft. After thus arranging and re-arranging his army many times very\r\nrapidly, he at last formed his phalanx into a sort of wedge, and led\r\nit towards the left against the enemy, who had long been in a state of\r\namazement at seeing both the order and the rapidity of his evolutions.\r\nConsequently they did not sustain Alexander’s attack, but quitted\r\nthe first ridges of the mountain. Upon this, Alexander ordered the\r\nMacedonians to raise the battle cry and make a clatter with their\r\nspears upon their shields; and the Taulantians, being still more\r\nalarmed at the noise, led their army back to the city with all speed.\r\n\r\nAs Alexander saw only a few of the enemy still occupying a ridge,\r\nalong which lay his route, he ordered his body-guards and personal\r\ncompanions to take their shields, mount their horses, and ride to\r\nthe hill; and when they reached it, if those who had occupied the\r\nposition awaited them, he said that half of them were to leap from\r\ntheir horses, and to fight as foot-soldiers, being mingled with the\r\ncavalry. But when the enemy saw Alexander’s advance, they quitted the\r\nhill and retreated to the mountains in both directions. Then Alexander,\r\nwith his companions,[62] seized the hill, and sent for the Agrianians\r\nand archers, who numbered 2,000. He also ordered the shield-bearing\r\nguards to cross the river, and after them the regiments of Macedonian\r\ninfantry, with instructions that, as soon as they had succeeded in\r\ncrossing, they should draw out in rank towards the left, so that the\r\nphalanx of men crossing might appear compact at once. He himself, in\r\nthe vanguard, was all the time observing from the ridge the enemy’s\r\nadvance. They, seeing the force crossing the river, marched down the\r\nmountains to meet them, with the purpose of attacking Alexander’s rear\r\nin its retreat. But, as they were just drawing near, Alexander rushed\r\nforth with his own division, and the phalanx raised the battle-cry,\r\nas if about to advance through the river. When the enemy saw all the\r\nMacedonians marching against them, they turned and fled. Upon this,\r\nAlexander led the Agrianians and archers at full speed towards the\r\nriver, and succeeded in being himself the first man to cross it. But\r\nwhen he saw the enemy pressing upon the men in the rear, he stationed\r\nhis engines of war upon the bank, and ordered the engineers to shoot\r\nfrom them as far forward as possible all sorts of projectiles which are\r\nusually shot from military engines.[63] He directed the archers, who\r\nhad also entered the water, to shoot their arrows from the middle of\r\nthe river. But Glaucias durst not advance within range of the missiles;\r\nso that the Macedonians passed over in such safety, that not one of\r\nthem lost his life in the retreat.\r\n\r\nThree days after this, Alexander discovered that Clitus and Glaucias\r\nlay carelessly encamped; that neither were their sentinels on guard\r\nin military order, nor had they protected themselves with a rampart\r\nor ditch, as if they imagined he had withdrawn through fear; and that\r\nthey had extended their line to a disadvantageous length. He therefore\r\ncrossed the river again secretly, at the approach of night, leading\r\nwith him the shield-bearing guards, the Agrianians, the archers, and\r\nthe brigades of Perdiccas[64] and Coenus,[65] after having given orders\r\nfor the rest of the army to follow. As soon as he saw a favourable\r\nopportunity for the attack, without waiting for all to be present, he\r\ndespatched the archers and Agrianians against the foe. These, being\r\narranged in phalanx, fell unawares with the most furious charge upon\r\ntheir flank, where they were likely to come into conflict with their\r\nweakest point, and slew some of them still in their beds, others being\r\neasily caught in their flight. Accordingly, many were there captured\r\nand killed, as were many also in the disorderly and panic-stricken\r\nretreat which ensued. Not a few, moreover, were taken prisoners.\r\nAlexander kept up the pursuit as far as the Taulantian mountains;\r\nand as many of them as escaped, preserved their lives by throwing\r\naway their arms. Clitus first fled for refuge into the city, which,\r\nhowever, he set on fire, and withdrew to Glaucias, in the land of the\r\nTaulantians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nREVOLT OF THEBES (_September_, B.C. 335).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these events were occurring, some of the exiles who had been\r\nbanished from Thebes, coming to the city by night, and being brought in\r\nby some of the citizens, in order to effect a change in the government,\r\napprehended and slew outside the Cadmea,[66] Amyntas and Timolaüs,[67]\r\ntwo of the men who held that fortress, having no suspicion that\r\nany hostile attempt was about to be made. Then entering the public\r\nassembly, they incited the Thebans to revolt from Alexander, holding\r\nout to them as pretexts the ancient and glorious words, liberty and\r\nfreedom of speech, and urging them now at last to rid themselves of the\r\nheavy yoke of the Macedonians. By stoutly maintaining that Alexander\r\nhad been killed in Illyria they gained more power in persuading the\r\nmultitude;[68] for this report was prevalent, and for many reasons it\r\ngained credit, both because he had been absent a long time, and because\r\nno news had arrived from him. Accordingly, as is usual in such cases,\r\nnot knowing the facts, each man conjectured what was most pleasing to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander heard what was being done at Thebes, he thought it was\r\na movement not at all to be slighted, inasmuch as he had for a long\r\ntime suspected the city of Athens and deemed the audacious action of\r\nthe Thebans no trivial matter, if the Lacedaemonians, who had long been\r\ndisaffected in their feelings to him, and the Aetolians and certain\r\nother States in the Peloponnese, who were not firm in their allegiance\r\nto him, should take part with the Thebans in their revolutionary\r\neffort. He therefore led his army through Eordaea and Elimiotis[69] and\r\nalong the peaks of Stymphaea and Paravaea,[70] and on the seventh day\r\narrived at Pelina[71] in Thessaly. Starting thence, he entered Boeotia\r\non the sixth day; so that the Thebans did not learn that he had passed\r\nsouth of Thermopylae, until he was at Onchestus[72] with the whole of\r\nhis army. Even then the authors of the revolt asserted that Antipater’s\r\narmy had arrived out of Macedonia, stoutly affirming that Alexander\r\nhimself was dead, and being very angry with those who announced that\r\nit was Alexander himself who was advancing.[73] For they said it must\r\nbe another Alexander, the son of Aëropus, who was coming.[74] On the\r\nfollowing day Alexander set out from Onchestus, and advanced towards\r\nthe city along the territory consecrated to Iolaüs;[75] where indeed\r\nhe encamped, in order to give the Thebans further time to repent of\r\ntheir evil resolutions and to send an embassy to him. But so far were\r\nthey from showing any sign of wishing to come to an accommodation,\r\nthat their cavalry and a large body of light-armed infantry sallied\r\nforth from the city as far as the camp, and, skirmishing with the\r\nMacedonian outposts, slew a few of their men. Alexander hereupon sent\r\nforth a party of his light-armed infantry and archers to repel their\r\nsortie; and these men repelled them with ease, just as they were\r\napproaching the very camp. The next day he took the whole of his army\r\nand marched round towards the gate which led to Eleutherae and Attica.\r\nBut not even then did he assault the wall itself, but encamped not\r\nfar away from the Cadmea, in order that succour might be at hand to\r\nthe Macedonians who were occupying that citadel. For the Thebans had\r\nblockaded the Cadmea with a double stockade and were guarding it, so\r\nthat no one from without might be able to give succour to those who\r\nwere beleaguered, and that the garrison might not be able, by making\r\na sally, to do them any injury, when they were attacking the enemy\r\noutside. But Alexander remained encamped near the Cadmea, for he still\r\nwished rather to come to friendly terms with the Thebans than to come\r\nto a contest with them.[76] Then those of the Thebans who knew what\r\nwas for the best interest of the commonwealth were eager to go out to\r\nAlexander and obtain pardon for the commonalty of Thebes for their\r\nrevolt; but the exiles and those who had summoned them home kept on\r\ninciting the populace to war by every means in their power, since they\r\ndespaired of obtaining for themselves any indulgence from Alexander,\r\nespecially as some of them were also Boeotarchs.[77] However not even\r\nfor this did Alexander assault the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFALL OF THEBES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Ptolemy, son of Lagus, tells us that Perdiccas, who had been posted\r\nin the advanced guard of the camp with his own brigade, and was not far\r\nfrom the enemy’s stockade, did not wait for the signal from Alexander\r\nto commence the battle; but of his own accord was the first to assault\r\nthe stockade, and, having made a breach in it, fell upon the advanced\r\nguard of the Thebans.[78] Amyntas,[79] son of Andromenes, followed\r\nPerdiccas, because he had been stationed with him. This general also\r\nof his own accord led on his brigade when he saw that Perdiccas had\r\nadvanced within the stockade. When Alexander saw this, he led on the\r\nrest of his army, fearing that unsupported they might be intercepted by\r\nthe Thebans and be in danger of destruction. He gave instructions to\r\nthe archers and Agrianians to rush within the stockade, but he still\r\nretained the guards and shield-bearing troops outside. Then indeed\r\nPerdiccas, after forcing his way within the second stockade, fell there\r\nwounded with a dart, and was carried back grievously injured to the\r\ncamp, where he was with difficulty cured of his wound. However the men\r\nof Perdiccas, in company with the archers sent by Alexander, fell upon\r\nthe Thebans and shut them up in the hollow way leading to the temple\r\nof Heracles, and followed them in their retreat as far as the temple\r\nitself. The Thebans, having wheeled round, again advanced from that\r\nposition with a shout, and put the Macedonians to flight. Eurybotas the\r\nCretan, the captain of the archers, fell with about seventy of his men;\r\nbut the rest fled to the Macedonian guard and the royal shield-bearing\r\ntroops. Now, when Alexander saw that his own men were in flight, and\r\nthat the Thebans had broken their ranks in pursuit, he attacked them\r\nwith his phalanx drawn up in proper order, and drove them back within\r\nthe gates. The Thebans fled in such a panic that being driven into\r\nthe city through the gates they had not time to shut them; for the\r\nMacedonians, who were close behind the fugitives, rushed with them\r\nwithin the fortifications, inasmuch as the walls were destitute of\r\ndefenders on account of the numerous pickets in front of them. When the\r\nMacedonians had entered the Cadmea, some of them marched out of it,\r\nin company with those who held the fortress, into the other part of\r\nthe city opposite the temple of Amphion,[80] but others crossing along\r\nthe walls, which were now in the possession of those who had rushed in\r\ntogether with the fugitives, advanced with a run into the market-place.\r\nThose of the Thebans who had been drawn up opposite the temple of\r\nAmphion stood their ground for a short time; but when the Macedonians\r\nunder the command of Alexander were seen to be pressing hard upon\r\nthem in various directions, their cavalry rushed through the city\r\nand sallied forth into the plain, and their infantry fled for safety\r\nas each man found it possible. Then indeed the Thebans, no longer\r\ndefending themselves, were slain, not so much by the Macedonians as by\r\nthe Phocians, Plataeans and other Boeotians,[81] who by indiscriminate\r\nslaughter vented their rage against them. Some were even attacked in\r\nthe houses, having there turned to defend themselves from the enemy,\r\nand others were slain as they were supplicating the protection of the\r\ngods in the temples; not even the women and children being spared.[82]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF THEBES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was felt by the Greeks to be a general calamity for it struck\r\nthe rest of the Greeks with no less consternation than it did those\r\nwho had themselves taken part in the struggle, both on account of the\r\nmagnitude of the captured city and the celerity of the action, the\r\nresult of which was in the highest degree contrary to the expectation\r\nboth of the sufferers and the perpetrators. For the disasters which\r\nbefell the Athenians in relation to Sicily,[83] though in regard to\r\nthe number of those who perished they brought no less misfortune to\r\nthe city, yet, because their army was destroyed far away from their\r\nown land, being composed for the most part rather of auxiliary troops\r\nthan of native Athenians, and because their city itself was left to\r\nthem intact, so that afterwards they held their own in war even for a\r\nlong time, though fighting against the Lacedaemonians and their allies,\r\nas well as the Great King; these disasters, I say, neither produced\r\nin the persons who were themselves involved in the calamity an equal\r\nsensation of the misfortune, nor did they cause the other Greeks a\r\nsimilar consternation at the catastrophe. Again, the defeat sustained\r\nby the Athenians at Aegospotami[84] was a naval one, and the city\r\nreceived no other humiliation than the demolition of the Long Walls,\r\nthe surrender of most of her ships, and the loss of supremacy. However,\r\nthey still retained their hereditary form of government, and not long\r\nafter recovered their former power to such a degree as not only to\r\nbuild up the Long Walls but to recover the rule of the sea[85] and in\r\ntheir turn to preserve from extreme danger those very Lacedaemonians\r\nthen so formidable to them, who had come and almost obliterated their\r\ncity. Moreover, the defeat of the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra and\r\nMantinea filled them with consternation rather by the unexpectedness\r\nof the disaster than because of the number of those who perished.[86]\r\nAnd the attack made by the Boeotians and Arcadians under Epaminondas\r\nupon the city of Sparta, even this terrified both the Lacedaemonians\r\nthemselves and those who participated with them in the transactions at\r\nthat time,[87] rather by the novelty of the sight than by the reality\r\nof the danger. The capture of the city of the Plataeans was not a great\r\ncalamity, by reason of the small number of those who were taken in it;\r\nmost of the citizens having long before escaped to Athens.[88] Again,\r\nthe capture of Melus and Scione simply related to insular States, and\r\nrather brought disgrace to those who perpetrated the outrages than\r\nproduced great surprise among the Grecian community as[89] a whole.\r\n\r\nBut the Thebans having effected their revolt suddenly and without any\r\nprevious consideration, the capture of the city being brought about\r\nin so short a time and without difficulty on the part of the captors,\r\nthe slaughter, being great, as was natural, from its being made by men\r\nof the same race who were glutting their revenge on them for ancient\r\ninjuries, the complete enslavement of a city which excelled among those\r\nin Greece at that time both in power and warlike reputation, all this\r\nwas attributed not without probability to the avenging wrath of the\r\ndeity. It seemed as if the Thebans had after a long time suffered this\r\npunishment for their betrayal of the Greeks in the Median war,[90] for\r\ntheir seizure of the city of Plataeae during the truce, and for their\r\ncomplete enslavement of it, as well as for the un-Hellenic slaughter\r\nof the men who had surrendered to the Lacedaemonians, which had been\r\ncommitted at the instigation of the Thebans; and for the devastation\r\nof the territory in which the Greeks had stood in battle-array against\r\nthe Medes and had repelled danger from Greece; lastly, because by\r\ntheir vote they had tried to ruin the Athenians when a motion was\r\nbrought forward among the allies of the Lacedaemonians for the\r\nenslavement of Athens.[91] Moreover it was reported that before the\r\ndisaster many portents were sent from the deity, which indeed at the\r\ntime were treated with neglect, but afterwards when men called them\r\nto remembrance they were compelled to consider that the events which\r\noccurred had been long before prognosticated.[92]\r\n\r\nThe settlement of Theban affairs was entrusted by Alexander to the\r\nallies who had taken part in the action. They resolved to occupy the\r\nCadmea with a garrison; to raze the city to the ground; to distribute\r\namong themselves all the territory, except what was dedicated to the\r\ngods; and to sell into slavery the women and children, and as many of\r\nthe males as survived, except those who were priests or priestesses,\r\nand those who were bound to Philip or Alexander by the ties of\r\nhospitality or had been public agents of the Macedonians. It is said\r\nthat Alexander preserved the house and the descendants of Pindar the\r\npoet, out of respect for his memory.[93] In addition to these things,\r\nthe allies decreed that Orchomenus[94] and Plataeae should be rebuilt\r\nand fortified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S DEALINGS WITH ATHENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as news of the calamity which had befallen the Thebans reached\r\nthe other Greeks, the Arcadians, who had set out from their own\r\nland for the purpose of giving aid to the Thebans, passed sentence\r\nof death on those who had instigated them to render aid. The Eleans\r\nalso received back their exiles from banishment, because they were\r\nAlexander’s adherents; and the Aetolians, each tribe for itself,\r\nsent embassies to him, begging to receive pardon, because they also\r\nhad attempted to effect a revolution, on the receipt of the report\r\nwhich had been spread by the Thebans. The Athenians also, who, at the\r\ntime when some of the Thebans, escaping from the carnage, arrived at\r\nAthens, were engaged in celebrating the Great Mysteries,[95] abandoned\r\nthe sacred rites in great consternation, and carried their goods and\r\nchattels from the rural districts into the city. The people came\r\ntogether in public assembly, and, on the motion of Demades, elected\r\nfrom all the citizens ten ambassadors, men whom they knew to be\r\nAlexander’s special adherents, and sent them to signify to him, though\r\nsomewhat unseasonably, that the Athenian people rejoiced at his safe\r\nreturn from the land of the Illyrians and Triballians, and at the\r\npunishment which he had inflicted upon the Thebans for their rebellion.\r\nIn regard to other matters he gave the embassy a courteous reply, but\r\nwrote a letter to the people demanding the surrender of Demosthenes and\r\nLycurgus, as well as that of Hyperides, Polyeuctus, Chares, Charidemus,\r\nEphialtes, Diotimus, and Moerocles;[96] alleging that these men were\r\nthe cause of the disaster which befell the city at Chaeronea, and the\r\nauthors of the subsequent offensive proceedings after Philip’s death,\r\nboth against himself and his father.[97] He also declared that they\r\nhad instigated the Thebans to revolt no less than had those of the\r\nThebans themselves who favoured a revolution. The Athenians, however,\r\ndid not surrender the men, but sent another embassy to Alexander,[98]\r\nentreating him to remit his wrath against the persons whom he had\r\ndemanded. The king did remit his wrath against them, either out of\r\nrespect for the city of Athens, or from an earnest desire to start on\r\nthe expedition into Asia, not wishing to leave behind him among the\r\nGreeks any cause for distrust. However, he ordered Charidemus alone of\r\nthe men whom he had demanded as prisoners and who had not been given\r\nup, to go into banishment. Charidemus therefore went as an exile to\r\nKing Darius in Asia.[99]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER CROSSES THE HELLESPONT AND VISITS TROY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving settled these affairs, he returned into Macedonia. He then\r\noffered to the Olympian Zeus the sacrifice which had been instituted\r\nby Archelaüs,[100] and had been customary up to that time; and he\r\ncelebrated the public contest of the Olympic games at Aegae.[101] It is\r\nsaid that he also held a public contest in honour of the Muses. At this\r\ntime it was reported that the statue of Orpheus, son of Oeagrus the\r\nThracian, which was in Pieris,[102] sweated incessantly.[103] Various\r\nwere the explanations of this prodigy given by the soothsayers; but\r\nAristander,[104] a man of Telmissus, a soothsayer, bade Alexander take\r\ncourage; for he said it was evident from this that there would be much\r\nlabour for the epic and lyric poets, and for the writers of odes, to\r\ncompose and sing about Alexander and his achievements.\r\n\r\n(B.C. 334.) At the beginning of the spring he marched towards the\r\nHellespont, entrusting the affairs of Macedonia and Greece to\r\nAntipater. He led not much above 30,000 infantry together with\r\nlight-armed troops and archers, and more than 5,000 cavalry.[105]\r\nHis march was past the lake Cercinitis,[106] towards Amphipolis and\r\nthe mouths of the river Strymon. Having crossed this river he passed\r\nby the Pangaean mountain,[107] along the road leading to Abdera and\r\nMaronea, Grecian cities built on the coast. Thence he arrived at the\r\nriver Hebrus,[108] and easily crossed it. Thence he proceeded through\r\nPaetica to the river Melas, having crossed which he arrived at Sestus,\r\nin twenty days altogether from the time of his starting from home. When\r\nhe came to Elaeūs he offered sacrifice to Protesilaus upon the tomb of\r\nthat hero, both for other reasons and because Protesilaus seemed to\r\nhave been the first of the Greeks who took part with Agamemnon in the\r\nexpedition to Ilium to disembark in Asia. The design of this sacrifice\r\nwas, that his disembarking in Asia might be more fortunate than that of\r\nProtesilaus had been.[109] He then committed to Parmenio the duty of\r\nconveying the cavalry and the greater part of the infantry from Sestus\r\nto Abydus; and they were transported in 160 triremes, besides many\r\ntrading vessels.[110] The prevailing account is, that Alexander started\r\nfrom Elaeūs and put into the Port of Achaeans,[111] that with his own\r\nhand he steered the general’s ship across, and that when he was about\r\nthe middle of the channel of the Hellespont he sacrificed a bull to\r\nPoseidon and the Nereids, and poured forth a libation to them into the\r\nsea from a golden goblet. They say also that he was the first man to\r\nstep out of the ship in full armour on the land of Asia,[112] and that\r\nhe erected altars to Zeus, the protector of people landing, to Athena,\r\nand to Heracles, at the place in Europe whence he started, and at the\r\nplace in Asia where he disembarked. It is also said that he went up to\r\nIlium and offered sacrifice to the Trojan Athena; that he set up his\r\nown panoply in the temple as a votive offering, and in exchange for it\r\ntook away some of the consecrated arms which had been preserved from\r\nthe time of the Trojan war. These arms were said to have been carried\r\nin front of him into the battles by the shield-bearing guards. A report\r\nalso prevails that he offered sacrifice to Priam upon the altar of Zeus\r\nthe household god, deprecating the wrath of Priam against the progeny\r\nof Neoptolemus, from whom Alexander himself derived his origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER AT THE TOMB OF ACHILLES.—MEMNON’S ADVICE REJECTED BY THE\r\nPERSIAN GENERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he went up to Ilium, Menoetius the pilot crowned him with a golden\r\ncrown; after him Chares the Athenian,[113] coming from Sigeum, as well\r\nas certain others, both Greeks and natives, did the same. Alexander\r\nthen encircled the tomb of Achilles with a garland; and it is said\r\nthat Hephaestion[114] decorated that of Patroclus in the same way.\r\nThere is indeed a report that Alexander pronounced Achilles fortunate\r\nin getting Homer as the herald of his fame to posterity.[115] And in\r\ntruth it was meet that Alexander should deem Achilles fortunate for\r\nthis reason especially; for to Alexander himself this privilege was\r\nwanting, a thing which was not in accordance with the rest of his good\r\nfortune. His achievements have, therefore, not been related to mankind\r\nin a manner worthy of the hero. Neither in prose nor in verse has any\r\none suitably honoured him; nor has he ever been sung of in a lyric\r\npoem, in which style of poetry Hiero, Gelo, Thero, and many others not\r\nat all comparable with Alexander, have been praised.[116] Consequently\r\nAlexander’s deeds are far less known than the meanest achievements of\r\nantiquity. For instance, the march of the ten thousand with Cyrus up to\r\nPersia against King Artaxerxes, the tragic fate of Clearchus and those\r\nwho were captured along with him,[117] and the march of the same men\r\ndown to the sea, in which they were led by Xenophon, are events much\r\nbetter known to men through Xenophon’s narrative than are Alexander and\r\nhis achievements. And yet Alexander neither accompanied another man’s\r\nexpedition, nor did he in flight from the Great King overcome those who\r\nobstructed his march down to the sea. And, indeed, there is no other\r\nsingle individual among Greeks or barbarians who achieved exploits so\r\ngreat or important either in regard to number or magnitude as he did.\r\nThis was the reason which induced me to undertake this history, not\r\nthinking myself incompetent to make Alexander’s deeds known to men. For\r\nwhoever I may be, this I know about myself, that there is no need for\r\nme to assert my name, for it is not unknown to men; nor is it needful\r\nfor me to say what my native land and family are, or if I have held\r\nany public office in my own country. But this I do assert, that this\r\nhistorical work is and has been from my youth up, in place of native\r\nland, family, and public offices to me; and for this reason I do not\r\ndeem myself unworthy to rank among the first authors in the Greek\r\nlanguage, if Alexander indeed is among the first in arms.\r\n\r\nFrom Ilium Alexander came to Arisbe, where his entire force had\r\nencamped after crossing the Hellespont; and on the following day\r\nhe came to Percote. On the next, passing by Lampsacus, he encamped\r\nnear the river Practius, which flows from the Idaean mountains and\r\ndischarges itself into the sea between the Hellespont and the Euxine\r\nSea. Thence passing by the city of Colonae, he arrived at Hermotus. He\r\nnow sent scouts before the army under the command of Amyntas, son of\r\nArrhabaeus, who had the squadron of the Companion cavalry which came\r\nfrom Apollonia,[118] under the captain Socrates, son of Sathon, and\r\nfour squadrons of what were called Prodromi (runners forward). In the\r\nmarch he despatched Panegorus, son of Lycagoras, one of the Companions,\r\nto take possession of the city of Priapus, which was surrendered by the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Persian generals were Arsames, Rheomithres, Petines, Niphates,\r\nand with them Spithridates, viceroy of Lydia and Ionia, and Arsites,\r\ngovernor of the Phrygia near the Hellespont. These had encamped\r\nnear the city of Zeleia with the Persian cavalry and the Grecian\r\nmercenaries. When they were holding a council about the state of\r\naffairs, it was reported to them that Alexander had crossed (the\r\nHellespont). Memnon, the Rhodian,[119] advised them not to risk a\r\nconflict with the Macedonians, since they were far superior to them\r\nin infantry, and Alexander was there in person; whereas Darius was\r\nnot with them. He advised them to advance and destroy the fodder,\r\nby trampling it down under their horses’ hoofs, to burn the crops\r\nof the country, and not even to spare the very cities. “For then\r\nAlexander,” said he, “will not be able to stay in the land from lack\r\nof provisions.”[120] It is said that in the Persian conference Arsites\r\nasserted that he would not allow a single house belonging to the people\r\nplaced under his rule to be burned, and that the other Persians agreed\r\nwith Arsites, because they had a suspicion that Memnon was deliberately\r\ncontriving to protract the war for the purpose of obtaining honour from\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE GRANICUS (B.C. 334).\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime Alexander was advancing to the river Granicus,[121] with his\r\narmy arranged for battle, having drawn up his heavy-armed troops in a\r\ndouble phalanx, leading the cavalry on the wings, and having ordered\r\nthat the baggage should follow in the rear. And Hegelochus at the head\r\nof the cavalry, who were armed with the long pike,[122] and about\r\n500 of the light-armed troops, was sent by him to reconnoitre the\r\nproceedings of the enemy. When Alexander was not far from the river\r\nGranicus, some of his scouts rode up to him at full speed and announced\r\nthat the Persians had taken up their position on the other side of\r\nthe Granicus, drawn up ready for battle. Thereupon Alexander arranged\r\nall his army with the intention of fighting. Then Parmenio approached\r\nhim and spoke as follows: “I think, O king, that it is advisable for\r\nthe present to pitch our camp on the bank of the river as we are.\r\nFor I think that the enemy, being, as they are, much inferior to us\r\nin infantry, will not dare to pass the night near us, and therefore\r\nthey will permit the army to cross the ford with ease at daybreak.\r\nFor we shall then pass over before they can put themselves in order\r\nof battle;[123] whereas, I do not think that we can now attempt the\r\noperation without evident risk, because it is not possible to lead the\r\narmy through the river with its front extended. Besides, it is clear\r\nthat many parts of the stream are deep, and you see that these banks\r\nare steep and in some places abrupt. Therefore the enemy’s cavalry,\r\nbeing formed into a dense square, will attack us as we emerge from\r\nthe water in broken ranks and in column, in the place where we are\r\nweakest. At the present juncture the first repulse would be difficult\r\nto retrieve, as well as perilous for the issue of the whole war.”\r\n\r\nBut to this Alexander replied: “I recognise the force of these\r\narguments, O Parmenio; but I should feel it a disgrace, if, after\r\ncrossing the Hellespont so easily, this brook (for with such an\r\nappellation he made light of the Granicus) should bar our passage for\r\na moment. I consider that this would be in accordance neither with the\r\nfame of the Macedonians nor with my own eagerness for encountering\r\ndanger. Moreover, I think that the Persians will regain courage, as\r\nbeing a match in war for Macedonians, since up to the present time they\r\nhave suffered no defeat from me to warrant the fear they entertain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF THE HOSTILE ARMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving spoken thus, he sent Parmenio to command upon the left wing,\r\nwhile he led in person on the right. And at the head of the right wing\r\nhe placed the following officers:—Philotas, son of Parmenio, with the\r\ncavalry Companions, the archers, and the Agrianian javelin-men; and\r\nAmyntas, son of Arrhabaeus, with the cavalry carrying the long pike,\r\nthe Paeonians, and the squadron of Socrates, was posted near Philotas.\r\nClose to these were posted the Companions who were shield-bearing\r\ninfantry under the command of Nicanor, son of Parmenio. Next to these\r\nthe brigade of Perdiccas, son of Orontes, then that of Coenus, son of\r\nPolemocrates; then that of Craterus,[124] son of Alexander, and that of\r\nAmyntas, son of Andromenes; finally, the men commanded by Philip, son\r\nof Amyntas. The first on the left wing were the Thessalian cavalry,\r\ncommanded by Calas, son of Harpalus;[125] next to these, the cavalry of\r\nthe Grecian allies, commanded by Philip, son of Menelaüs;[126] next to\r\nthese the Thracians, commanded by Agatho.[127] Close to these were the\r\ninfantry, the brigades of Craterus, Meleager, and Philip, reaching as\r\nfar as the centre of the entire line.\r\n\r\nThe Persian cavalry were about 20,000 in number, and their infantry,\r\nconsisting of Grecian mercenaries, fell a little short of the same\r\nnumber.[128] They had extended their horse along the bank of the river\r\nin a long phalanx, and had posted the infantry behind the cavalry,\r\nfor the ground above the bank was steep and commanding. They also\r\nmarshalled dense squadrons of cavalry upon that part of the bank where\r\nthey observed Alexander himself advancing against their left wing;\r\nfor he was conspicuous both by the brightness of his arms and by the\r\nrespectful service of his attendants. Both armies stood a long time\r\nat the margin of the river, keeping quiet from dread of the result;\r\nand profound silence was observed on both sides. For the Persians were\r\nwaiting till the Macedonians should step into the water, with the\r\nintention of attacking them as they emerged. Alexander leaped upon his\r\nsteed, ordering those about him to follow, and exhorting them to show\r\nthemselves valiant men. He then commanded Amyntas, son of Arrhabaeus,\r\nto make the first rush into the river at the head of the skirmishing\r\ncavalry, the Paeonians, and one regiment of infantry; and in front of\r\nthese he had placed Ptolemy, son of Philip, in command of the squadron\r\nof Socrates, which body of men indeed on that day happened to have\r\nthe lead of all the cavalry force. He himself led the right wing with\r\nsounding of trumpets, and the men raising the war-cry to Enyalius.[129]\r\nHe entered the ford, keeping his line always extended obliquely in the\r\ndirection in which the stream flowed, in order that the Persians might\r\nnot fall upon him on the flank as he was emerging from the water, but\r\nthat he might, as far as practicable,[130] encounter them with his\r\nphalanx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BATTLE OF THE GRANICUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Persians began the contest by hurling missiles from above in the\r\ndirection where the men of Amyntas and Socrates were the first to\r\nreach the bank; some of them casting javelins into the river from\r\ntheir commanding position on the bank, and others stepping down along\r\nthe flatter parts of it to the very edge of the water. Then ensued a\r\nviolent struggle on the part of the cavalry, on the one side to emerge\r\nfrom the river, and on the other to prevent the landing. From the\r\nPersians there was a terrible discharge of darts; but the Macedonians\r\nfought with spears. The Macedonians, being far inferior in number,\r\nsuffered severely at the first onset, because they were obliged to\r\ndefend themselves in the river, where their footing was unsteady,\r\nand where they were below the level of their assailants; whereas the\r\nPersians were fighting from the top of the bank, which gave them an\r\nadvantage, especially as the best of the Persian horse had been posted\r\nthere. Memnon himself, as well as his sons, were running every risk\r\nwith these; and the Macedonians who first came into conflict with\r\nthe Persians, though they showed great valour, were cut down, except\r\nthose who retreated to Alexander, who was now approaching. For the\r\nking was already near, leading with him the right wing. He made his\r\nfirst assault upon the Persians at the place where the whole mass of\r\ntheir horse and the leaders themselves were posted; and around him a\r\ndesperate conflict raged,[131] during which one rank of the Macedonians\r\nafter another easily kept on crossing the river. Though they fought on\r\nhorseback, it seemed more like an infantry than a cavalry battle; for\r\nthey struggled for the mastery, horses being jammed with horses and\r\nmen with men, the Macedonians striving to drive the Persians entirely\r\naway from the bank and to force them into the plain, and the Persians\r\nstriving to obstruct their landing and to push them back again into\r\nthe river. At last Alexander’s men began to gain the advantage, both\r\nthrough their superior strength and military discipline, and because\r\nthey fought with spear-shafts made of cornel-wood, whereas the Persians\r\nused only darts.\r\n\r\nThen indeed, Alexander’s spear being broken to shivers in the conflict,\r\nhe asked Aretis, one of the royal guards, whose duty it was to assist\r\nthe king to mount his horse, for another spear. But this man’s spear\r\nhad also been shivered whilst he was in the thickest of the struggle,\r\nand he was conspicuous fighting with the half of his broken spear.\r\nShowing this to Alexander, he bade him ask some one else for one. Then\r\nDemaratus, a man of Corinth, one of his personal Companions, gave him\r\nhis own spear; which he had no sooner taken than seeing Mithridates,\r\nthe son-in-law of Darius, riding far in front of the others, and\r\nleading with him a body of cavalry arranged like a wedge, he rode on\r\nin front of the others, and hitting at the face of Mithridates with\r\nhis spear, struck him to the ground. But hereupon, Rhoesaces rode up\r\nto Alexander and hit him on the head with his scimitar, breaking off\r\na piece of his helmet. But the helmet broke the force of the blow.\r\nThis man also Alexander struck to the ground, hitting him in the chest\r\nthrough the breastplate with his lance. And now Spithridates from\r\nbehind had already raised aloft his scimitar against the king, when\r\nClitus, son of Dropidas, anticipated his blow, and hitting him on the\r\narm, cut it off, scimitar and all.[132] Meantime the horsemen, as many\r\nas were able, kept on securing a landing all down the river, and were\r\njoining Alexander’s forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF THE PERSIANS.—LOSS ON BOTH SIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Persians themselves, as well as their horses, were now being\r\nstruck on their faces with the lances from all sides, and were being\r\nrepulsed by the cavalry. They also received much damage from the\r\nlight-armed troops who were mingled with the cavalry. They first began\r\nto give way where Alexander himself was braving danger in the front.\r\nWhen their centre had given way, the horse on both wings were also\r\nnaturally broken through, and took to speedy flight. Of the Persian\r\ncavalry only about 1,000 were killed; for Alexander did not pursue\r\nthem far, but turned aside to attack the Greek mercenaries, the\r\nmain body of whom was still remaining where it was posted at first.\r\nThis they did rather from amazement at the unexpected result of the\r\nstruggle than from any steady resolution. Leading the phalanx against\r\nthese, and ordering the cavalry to fall upon them from all sides in\r\nthe midst, he soon cut them up, so that none of them escaped except\r\nsuch as might have concealed themselves among the dead bodies. About\r\n2,000 were taken prisoners.[133] The following leaders of the Persians\r\nalso fell in the battle: Niphates, Petines, Spithridates, viceroy\r\nof Lydia, Mithrobuzanes, governor of Cappadocia, Mithridates, the\r\nson-in-law of Darius, Arbupales, son of Darius the son of Artaxerxes,\r\nPharnaces, brother of the wife of Darius,[134] and Onares, commander\r\nof the auxiliaries. Arsites fled from the battle into Phrygia, where\r\nhe is reported to have committed suicide, because he was deemed by the\r\nPersians the cause of their defeat on that occasion.\r\n\r\nOf the Macedonians, about twenty-five of the Companions were killed\r\nat the first onset; brazen statues of whom were erected at Dium,[135]\r\nexecuted by Lysippus,[136] at Alexander’s order. The same statuary\r\nalso executed a statue of Alexander himself, being chosen by him for\r\nthe work in preference to all other artists. Of the other cavalry over\r\nsixty were slain, and of the infantry, about thirty.[137] These were\r\nburied by Alexander the next day, together with their arms and other\r\ndecorations. To their parents and children he granted exemption from\r\nimposts on agricultural produce, and he relieved them from all personal\r\nservices and taxes upon property. He also exhibited great solicitude in\r\nregard to the wounded, for he himself visited each man, looked at their\r\nwounds, and inquired how and in the performance of what duty they had\r\nreceived them, allowing them both to speak and brag of their own deeds.\r\nHe also buried the Persian commanders and the Greek mercenaries who\r\nwere killed fighting on the side of the enemy. But as many of them as\r\nhe took prisoners he bound in fetters and sent them away to Macedonia\r\nto till the soil, because, though they were Greeks, they were fighting\r\nagainst Greece on behalf of the foreigners in opposition to the decrees\r\nwhich the Greeks had made in their federal council.[138] To Athens also\r\nhe sent 300 suits of Persian armour to be hung up in the Acropolis[139]\r\nas a votive offering to Athena, and ordered this inscription to be\r\nfixed over them: “Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except\r\nthe Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from\r\nthe foreigners inhabiting Asia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER IN SARDIS AND EPHESUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving appointed Calas to the post of viceroy of the territory\r\nwhich had been under the rule of Arsites, and having commanded the\r\ninhabitants to pay to him the same tribute which they had paid to\r\nDarius, he ordered as many of the natives as came down from the\r\nmountains and surrendered to him to depart to their several abodes.\r\nHe also acquitted the people of Zeleia[140] of blame, because he\r\nknew they had been compelled to assist the Persians in the war. He\r\nthen despatched Parmenio to occupy Dascylium,[141] which he easily\r\nperformed; for the garrison evacuated it. He himself advanced towards\r\nSardis; and when he was about 70 stades[142] distant from that city, he\r\nwas met by Mithrines, the commandant of the garrison in the Acropolis,\r\naccompanied by the most influential of the citizens of Sardis. The\r\nlatter surrendered the city into his hands, and Mithrines the fortress\r\nand the money laid up in it. Alexander encamped near the river\r\nHermus,[143] which is about twenty stades[144] distant from Sardis;\r\nbut he sent Amyntas, son of Andromenes, to occupy the citadel of\r\nSardis.[145] He took Mithrines with him, treating him with honour; and\r\ngranted the Sardians and other Lydians the privilege of enjoying the\r\nancient laws of Lydia, and permitted them to be free. He then ascended\r\ninto the citadel, which was garrisoned by the Persians. And the\r\nposition seemed to him a strong one; for it was very lofty, precipitous\r\non every side, and fenced round by a triple wall. He therefore resolved\r\nto build a temple to the Olympian Zeus on the hill, and to erect an\r\naltar in it; but while he was considering which part of the hill was\r\nthe most suitable site, suddenly a winter storm arose, though it was\r\nthe summer season, loud claps of thunder were heard, and rain fell on\r\nthe spot where the palace of the kings of Lydia had stood. From this\r\nAlexander thought that the deity had revealed to him where the temple\r\nto Zeus ought to be built; and he gave orders accordingly. He left\r\nPausanias, one of the Companions, to be superintendent of the citadel\r\nof Sardis, Nicias to supervise the collection of the tribute and taxes,\r\nand Asander, son of Philotas, to be superintendent of Lydia and the\r\nrest of the dominion of Spithridates, giving him as large a number\r\nof cavalry and light-armed infantry as seemed sufficient for present\r\nemergencies. He also sent Calas and Alexander, son of Aëropus, into the\r\ncountry of Memnon,[146] in command of the Peloponnesians and most of\r\nthe other Grecian allies, except the Argives, who had been left behind\r\nto guard the citadel of Sardis.\r\n\r\nMeantime, when the news of the cavalry battle was spread abroad, the\r\nGrecian mercenaries who formed the garrison of Ephesus, seized two of\r\nthe Ephesian triremes and set off in flight. They were accompanied\r\nby Amyntas,[147] son of Antiochus, who had fled from Alexander out\r\nof Macedonia, not because he had received any injury from the king,\r\nbut from ill-will to him, and thinking it not unlikely that he should\r\nsuffer some ill-treatment from him (on account of his disloyalty). On\r\nthe fourth day Alexander arrived at Ephesus, where he recalled from\r\nexile all the men who had been banished from the city on account\r\nof their adherence to him; and having broken up the oligarchy, he\r\nestablished a democratical form of government there. He also ordered\r\nthe Ephesians to contribute to Artemis[148] all the tribute which\r\nthey were in the habit of paying to the Persians. When the people of\r\nEphesus were relieved of their dread of the oligarchs, they rushed\r\nheadlong to kill the men who had brought Memnon into the city, as also\r\nthose who had pillaged the temple of Artemis, and those who had thrown\r\ndown the statue of Philip which was in the temple, and those who had\r\ndug up and carried off from the tomb in the market place the bones of\r\nHeropythus, the liberator of their city. They also led Syrphax, and\r\nhis son Pelagon, and the sons of Syrphax’s brothers out of the temple\r\nand stoned them to death. But Alexander prevented them making any\r\nfurther quest of the rest of the oligarchs for the purpose of wreaking\r\ntheir vengeance upon them; for he knew that if the people were not\r\nchecked, they would kill the innocent along with the guilty, some from\r\nhatred, and others for the sake of seizing their property. At this time\r\nAlexander gained great popularity both by his general course of action\r\nand especially by what he did at Ephesus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER MARCHES TO MILETUS AND OCCUPIES THE ISLAND OF LADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMen now came to him both from Magnesia[149] and Tralles, offering to\r\nsurrender those cities; and to them he sent Parmenio, giving him 2,500\r\ninfantry from the Grecian auxiliaries, an equal number of Macedonians,\r\nand about 200 of the Cavalry Companions. He also sent Lysimachus, son\r\nof Agathocles,[150] with an equal force to the Aeolic cities,[151] and\r\nto as many of the Ionic cities[152] as were still under the Persians.\r\nHe was ordered to break up the oligarchies everywhere, to set up the\r\ndemocratical form of government, to restore their own laws to each of\r\nthe cities, and to remit the tribute which they were accustomed to pay\r\nto the foreigners. But Alexander himself remained behind at Ephesus,\r\nwhere he offered a sacrifice to Artemis and conducted a procession in\r\nher honour with the whole of his army fully armed and marshalled for\r\nbattle.[153]\r\n\r\nOn the following day he took the rest of his infantry, the archers, the\r\nAgrianians, the Thracian cavalry, the royal squadron of the Companions,\r\nand three other squadrons in addition, and set out for Miletus. At\r\nhis first assault he captured that which was called the outer city;\r\nfor the garrison had evacuated it. There he encamped and resolved to\r\nblockade the inner city; for Hegesistratus, to whom the king Darius\r\nhad entrusted the command of the garrison in Miletus, kept on sending\r\nletters before this to Alexander, offering to surrender Miletus to\r\nhim. But then, having regained his courage from the fact that the\r\nPersian fleet was not far off, he made up his mind to preserve the\r\ncity for Darius. But Nicanor, the commander of the Grecian fleet,\r\nanticipated the Persians by sailing into the port of Miletus three days\r\nbefore they approached; and with 160 ships he anchored at the island\r\nof Lade, which lies near Miletus.[154] The Persian ships arriving\r\ntoo late, and the admirals discovering that Nicanor had occupied\r\nthe anchorage at Lade before them, they took moorings near Mount\r\nMycale.[155] Alexander had forestalled them in seizing the island, not\r\nonly by mooring his ships near it, but also by transporting into it the\r\nThracians and about 4,000 of the other auxiliary troops. The ships of\r\nthe foreigners were about 400 in number.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the superiority of the Persian fleet, Parmenio advised\r\nAlexander to fight a sea-battle, expecting that the Greeks would be\r\nvictorious with their fleet both for other reasons and especially\r\nbecause an omen from the deity made him confident of the result; for\r\nan eagle had been seen sitting upon the shore, opposite the sterns of\r\nAlexander’s ships.[156] He also urged that if they won the battle, they\r\nwould reap a great advantage from it in regard to their main object\r\nin the war; and if they were beaten, their defeat would not be of any\r\ngreat moment; for even as it was, the Persians held the sovereignty of\r\nthe sea. He added that he was willing to go on board the fleet himself\r\nand to share the danger. However, Alexander replied that Parmenio was\r\nmistaken in his judgment, and did not explain the sign according to\r\nprobability. For it would be rash for him with a few ships to fight a\r\nbattle against a fleet far more numerous than his own, and with his\r\nunpractised naval force to contend against the disciplined fleet of\r\nthe Cyprians and Phoenicians. Besides, he did not wish to deliver over\r\nto the foreigners on so unstable an element the advantage which the\r\nMacedonians derived from their skill and courage; and if they were\r\nbeaten in the sea-battle, their defeat would be no small hindrance to\r\ntheir final success in the war, both for other reasons, and especially\r\nbecause the Greeks, being animated with courage at the news of his\r\nnaval defeat, would attempt to effect a revolution. Taking all these\r\nthings into consideration, he declared that he did not think that it\r\nwas a suitable time for fighting a sea-battle; and for his part, he\r\nexpounded the divine omen in a different way. He admitted that the\r\neagle was in his favour; but as it was seen sitting on the land, it\r\nseemed to him rather to be a sign that he should get the mastery over\r\nthe Persian fleet by defeating their army on land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSIEGE AND CAPTURE OF MILETUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Glaucippus, one of the most notable men in Miletus, was\r\nsent out to Alexander by the people and the Grecian mercenaries, to\r\nwhom rather than to the citizens the town had been entrusted, to\r\ntell him that the Milesians were willing to make their walls and\r\nharbours[157] free to him and the Persians in common; and on these\r\nterms to demand that he should raise the siege. But Alexander ordered\r\nGlaucippus to depart without delay into the city, and tell the citizens\r\nto prepare for a battle at daybreak. He then stationed his military\r\nengines near the wall, and having in a short time partly broken and\r\npartly shaken down a large piece of it, he led his army near, that the\r\nmen might enter wherever the wall had been thrown down or shaken. The\r\nPersians from Mycale were following close[158] upon them and could\r\nalmost see their friends and allies being besieged. In the meantime,\r\nNicanor, observing from Lade Alexander’s commencement of the attack,\r\nbegan to sail into the harbour of Miletus, rowing along the shore;\r\nand mooring his triremes as close as possible together, with their\r\nprows facing the enemy, across the narrowest part of the mouth of\r\nthe harbour, he shut off the Persian fleet from the port and made it\r\nimpossible for the Persians to give succour to the Milesians. Then\r\nthe Macedonians from all sides pressed close upon the citizens and\r\nthe Grecian mercenaries, who took to flight; some of them, casting\r\nthemselves into the sea, floated along upon their shields with the\r\nhollow upwards to an unnamed islet which lies near the city; others\r\ngetting into their skiffs and hastening to get the start of the\r\nMacedonian triremes, were captured by them at the mouth of the harbour.\r\nBut the majority of them were slain in the city itself. As soon as\r\nAlexander had got possession of the city, he sailed against those who\r\nhad fled for refuge into the island; ordering the men to carry ladders\r\nupon the prows of the triremes, with the intention of effecting a\r\nlanding along the cliffs of the island, as one would mount a wall. But\r\nwhen he saw that the men on the island were resolved to run every risk,\r\nhe was moved with pity for them, because they appeared to him both\r\nbrave and loyal; wherefore he made a truce with them on the condition\r\nthat they would serve as his soldiers. These Grecian mercenaries were\r\nabout 300 in number. He likewise pardoned all the citizens of Miletus\r\nwho had escaped death in the capture of the city, and he granted them\r\ntheir freedom.\r\n\r\nThe foreigners used to start from Mycale every day and sail up to the\r\nGrecian fleet, hoping to induce them to accept the challenge and come\r\nforth to a battle; but during the night they used to moor their vessels\r\nnear Mycale, which was an inconvenient station, because they were under\r\nthe necessity of fetching water from the mouth of the river Maeander, a\r\ngreat way off.[159] Alexander guarded the harbour of Miletus with his\r\nships, in order to prevent the foreigners from forcing an entrance;\r\nand at the same time he sent Philotas to Mycale in command of the\r\ncavalry and three regiments of infantry, with instructions to prevent\r\nthe men in the ships from landing. Accordingly, they, being through\r\nthe scarcity of fresh water and of the other necessaries of life as\r\ngood as besieged in their ships, sailed away to Samos; where furnishing\r\nthemselves with food, they sailed back again to Miletus. They then drew\r\nup most of their ships in front of the harbour on the deep sea, with\r\nthe hope that they might in some way or other induce the Macedonians\r\nto come out into the open sea. Five of their ships sailed into the\r\nroadstead which lay between the island of Lade and the camp, expecting\r\nto surprise Alexander’s ships while empty of their crews; for they had\r\nascertained that the sailors for the most part were dispersed from the\r\nships, some to gather fuel, others to collect provisions, and others\r\nbeing arranged in foraging parties.[160] And indeed it happened that a\r\nnumber of the sailors were absent; but as soon as Alexander observed\r\nthe five Persian ships sailing towards him, he manned ten ships with\r\nthe sailors who happened to be at hand, and sent them with all speed\r\nagainst them with orders to attack prow to prow. No sooner did the men\r\nin the five Persian ships see the Macedonians bearing up against them,\r\ncontrary to their expectation, than they immediately tacked about,\r\nthough far off, and fled to the rest of their fleet. However, the ship\r\nof the Iassians,[161] not being a fast sailer, was captured in the\r\nflight, men and all; but the other four succeeded in escaping to their\r\nown triremes. After this the Persians sailed away from Miletus without\r\neffecting anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF HALICARNASSUS.—ABORTIVE ATTACK ON MYNDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander now resolved to disband his fleet, partly from lack of\r\nmoney at the time, and partly because he saw that his own fleet was\r\nnot a match in battle for that of the Persians. On this account he\r\nwas unwilling to run the risk of losing even a part of his armament.\r\nBesides, he considered, that now he was occupying Asia with his\r\nland force, he would no longer be in need of a fleet; and that he\r\nwould be able to break up that of the Persians, if he captured the\r\nmaritime cities; since they would neither have any ports from which\r\nthey could recruit their crews, nor any harbour in Asia to which they\r\ncould bring their ships. Thus he explained the omen of the eagle to\r\nsignify that he should get the mastery over the enemy’s ships by his\r\nland force. After doing this, he set forth into Caria,[162] because\r\nit was reported that a considerable force, both of foreigners and\r\nof Grecian auxiliaries, had collected in Halicarnassus.[163] Having\r\ntaken all the cities between Miletus and Halicarnassus as soon as\r\nhe approached them, he encamped near the latter city, at a distance\r\nfrom it of about five stades,[164] as if he expected a long siege.\r\nFor the natural position of the place made it strong; and wherever\r\nthere seemed to be any deficiency in security, it had been entirely\r\nsupplied long before by Memnon, who was there in person, having now\r\nbeen proclaimed by Darius governor of lower Asia and commander of the\r\nentire fleet. Many Grecian mercenary soldiers had been left in the\r\ncity, as well as many Persian troops; the triremes also were moored\r\nin the harbour, so that the sailors might render him valuable aid in\r\nthe operations. On the first day of the siege, while Alexander was\r\nleading his men up to the wall in the direction of the gate leading\r\ntowards Mylasa,[165] the men in the city made a sortie, and a skirmish\r\ntook place; but Alexander’s men making a rush upon them repulsed\r\nthem with ease, and shut them up in the city. A few days after this,\r\nthe king took the shield-bearing guards, the Cavalry Companions, the\r\ninfantry regiments of Amyntas, Perdiccas and Meleager, and in addition\r\nto these the archers and Agrianians, and went round to the part of\r\nthe city which is in the direction of Myndus, both for the purpose\r\nof inspecting the wall, to see if it happened to be more easy to be\r\nassaulted there than elsewhere; and at the same time to see if he could\r\nget hold of Myndus[166] by a sudden and secret attack. For he thought\r\nthat if Myndus were his own, it would be no small help in the siege of\r\nHalicarnassus; moreover, an offer to surrender had been made by the\r\nMyndians if he would approach the town secretly, under the cover of\r\nnight. About midnight, therefore, he approached the wall, according to\r\nthe plan agreed on; but as no sign of surrender was made by the men\r\nwithin, and though he had with him no military engines or ladders,\r\ninasmuch as he had not set out to besiege the town, but to receive\r\nit on surrender, he nevertheless led the Macedonian phalanx near and\r\nordered them to undermine the wall. They threw down one of the towers,\r\nwhich, however, in its fall did not make a breach in the wall. But the\r\nmen in the city stoutly defending themselves, and at the same time\r\nmany from Halicarnassus having already come to their aid by sea, made\r\nit impossible for Alexander to capture Myndus by surprise or sudden\r\nassault. Wherefore he returned without accomplishing any of the plans\r\nfor which he had set out, and devoted himself once more to the siege of\r\nHalicarnassus.\r\n\r\nIn the first place he filled up with earth the ditch which the enemy\r\nhad dug in front of the city, about thirty cubits wide and fifteen\r\ndeep; so that it might be easy to bring forward the towers, from which\r\nhe intended to discharge missiles against the defenders of the wall;\r\nand that he might bring up the other engines with which he was planning\r\nto batter the wall down. He easily filled up the ditch, and the towers\r\nwere then brought forward. But the men in Halicarnassus made a sally by\r\nnight with the design of setting fire both to the towers and the other\r\nengines which had been brought up to the wall, or were nearly brought\r\nup to it. They were, however, easily repelled and shut up again within\r\nthe walls by the Macedonians who were guarding the engines, and by\r\nothers who were aroused by the noise of the struggle and who came to\r\ntheir aid. Neoptolemus, the brother of Arrhabaeus, son of Amyntas, one\r\nof those who had deserted to Darius, was killed, with about 170 others\r\nof the enemy. Of Alexander’s soldiers sixteen were killed and 300\r\nwounded; for the sally being made in the night, they were less able to\r\nguard themselves from being wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF HALICARNASSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after this, two Macedonian hoplites of the brigade of\r\nPerdiccas, living in the same tent and being messmates, happened in\r\nthe course of conversation each to be extolling himself and his own\r\nexploits. Hence a quarrel arose between them as to which of them was\r\nthe braver, and, being somewhat inflamed with wine, they agreed to arm\r\nthemselves, and of their own accord go and assault the wall facing\r\nthe citadel, which for the most part was turned towards Mylasa. This\r\nthey did rather to make a display of their own valour than to engage\r\nin a dangerous conflict with the enemy. Some of the men in the city,\r\nhowever, perceiving that there were only two of them, and that they\r\nwere approaching the wall inconsiderately, rushed out upon them; but\r\nthey slew those who came near, and hurled darts at those who stood at\r\na distance. At last, however, they were overmatched both by the number\r\nof their assailants and the disadvantage of their own position; for the\r\nenemy made the attack upon them, and threw darts at them from a higher\r\nlevel.[167] Meanwhile some other men from the brigade of Perdiccas,\r\nand others from Halicarnassus, rushed out against each other; and a\r\nsharp contest ensued near the wall. Those who had made the sally from\r\nthe city were driven back, and again shut up within the gates by the\r\nMacedonians. The city also narrowly escaped capture; for the walls\r\nat that time were not under strict guard, and two towers, with the\r\nwhole intermediate space, having already fallen to the ground, would\r\nhave offered an easy entrance within the wall to the army, if the\r\nwhole of it had undertaken the task. The third tower, which had been\r\nthoroughly shaken, would likewise have been easily thrown down if it\r\nhad been undermined; but the enemy easily succeeded in building inside\r\na crescent-shaped brick wall to take the place of the one which had\r\nfallen. This they were able to do so quickly because of the multitude\r\nof hands at their disposal. On the following day Alexander brought his\r\nengines up to this wall also; and the men in the city made another\r\nsally to set them on fire. A part of the wicker-work shed near the\r\nwall and a piece of one of the wooden towers were burnt, but the rest\r\nwere protected by Philotas and Hellanicus, to whom the charge of them\r\nhad been committed. But as soon as those who were making the sally saw\r\nAlexander, the men who had come out to render aid by holding torches\r\nthrew them away, and the majority of them cast away their arms and fled\r\nwithin the walls of the city. Then at first they had the advantage from\r\nthe nature of their position, which was commanding on account of its\r\nheight; for not only did they cast missiles right in front against the\r\nmen who were guarding the engines, but also from the towers which alone\r\nhad been left standing at each end of the battered-down wall, they were\r\nable to cast them against the sides, and almost against the backs, of\r\nthose who were assaulting the wall which had just been built in place\r\nof the ruined one.[168]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF HALICARNASSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after this, when Alexander again brought his military\r\nengines up to the inner brick wall, and was himself superintending\r\nthe work, a sortie in mass was made from the city, some advancing by\r\nthe breach in the wall, where Alexander himself was posted, others by\r\nthe triple gate, where the Macedonians did not at all expect them.\r\nThe first party cast torches and other combustibles at the engines,\r\nin order to set them on fire and to defy the engineers excessively.\r\nBut when the men around Alexander attacked them vigorously, hurling\r\ngreat stones with the engines from the towers, and launching darts\r\nat them, they were easily put to rout and fled into the city; and as\r\na great number of them had sallied forth and great audacity had been\r\nexhibited in the fight, no small slaughter of them took place. For\r\nsome of them were slain fighting hand-to-hand with the Macedonians,\r\nothers were killed near the ruins of the wall,[169] because the breach\r\nwas too narrow for such a multitude to pass through, and the fragments\r\nof the wall made it difficult for them to scale it. The second party,\r\nwhich sallied forth by the triple gate, was met by Ptolemy,[170] one\r\nof the royal body-guards, who had with him the regiments of Addaeus\r\nand Timander and some of the light-armed troops. These soldiers by\r\nthemselves easily put the men of the city to rout; but as the latter\r\nin their retreat were fleeing over a narrow bridge which had been made\r\nover the ditch, they had the misfortune to break it down by the weight\r\nof their multitude. Many of them fell into the ditch, some of whom\r\nwere trampled to death by their own comrades, and others were killed\r\nby the Macedonian weapons from above. A very great slaughter was also\r\nmade at the very gates, because they were shut before the proper time\r\nin a state of panic. For the enemy, being afraid that the Macedonians,\r\nwho were close upon the fugitives, would rush in with them, shut many\r\nof their friends out, who were slain by the Macedonians near the very\r\nwalls. The city narrowly escaped capture; indeed it would have been\r\ntaken, had not Alexander called back his army, to see if some friendly\r\nsign of surrender would be made by the Halicarnassians; for he was\r\nstill desirous of saving their city. Of the men in the city about one\r\nthousand were slain; and of Alexander’s men about forty, among whom\r\nwere Ptolemy, one of the king’s body-guards, Clearchus, a captain of\r\nthe archers, Addaeus, who had the command of a thousand infantry, and\r\nother Macedonians of no mean position.[171]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF HALICARNASSUS.—ADA, QUEEN OF CARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Orontobates and Memnon, the commanders of the Persians, met and\r\ndecided from the state of affairs that they could not hold out long\r\nagainst the siege, seeing that part of the wall had already fallen\r\ndown and part had been battered and weakened, and that many of their\r\nsoldiers had either perished in the sorties or been wounded and\r\ndisabled. Taking these things into consideration, about the second\r\nwatch of the night they set fire to the wooden tower which they had\r\nthemselves built to resist the enemy’s military engines, and to the\r\nmagazines in which their weapons were stored. They also cast fire into\r\nthe houses near the wall; and others were burned by the flames, which\r\nwere carried with great fury from the magazines and the tower by the\r\nwind bearing in that direction. Some of the enemy then withdrew to the\r\nstronghold in the island (called Arconnesus), and others to another\r\nfortress called Salmacis. When this was reported to Alexander by some\r\ndeserters from the incendiaries, and he himself could see the raging\r\nfire, though the occurrence took place about midnight, yet he led out\r\nthe Macedonians and slew those who were still engaged in setting fire\r\nto the city. But he issued orders to preserve all the Halicarnassians\r\nwho should be taken in their houses. As soon as the daylight appeared\r\nhe could discern the strongholds which the Persians and the Grecian\r\nmercenaries had occupied; but he decided not to besiege them,\r\nconsidering that he would meet with no small delay beleaguering them,\r\nfrom the nature of their position, and moreover thinking that they\r\nwould be of little importance to him now that he had captured the whole\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nWherefore, burying the dead in the night, he ordered the men who\r\nhad been placed in charge of the military engines to convey them to\r\nTralles. He himself marched into Phrygia, after razing the city to\r\nthe ground, and leaving 3,000 Grecian infantry and 200 cavalry as a\r\nguard both of this place and of the rest of Caria, under the command\r\nof Ptolemy. He appointed Ada to act as his viceroy of the whole\r\nof Caria.[172] This queen was daughter of Hecatomnus and wife of\r\nHidrieus, who, though he was her brother, lived with her in wedlock,\r\naccording to the custom of the Carians. When Hidrieus was dying, he\r\nconfided the administration of affairs to her, for it had been a\r\ncustom in Asia, ever since the time of Semiramis, even for women to\r\nrule men. But Pixodarus expelled her from the rule, and seized the\r\nadministration of affairs himself. On the death of Pixodarus, his\r\nson-in-law Orontobates was sent by the king of the Persians to rule\r\nover the Carians. Ada retained Alinda alone, the strongest place in\r\nCaria; and when Alexander invaded Caria she went to meet him, offering\r\nto surrender Alinda to him, and adopting him as her son.[173] Alexander\r\nconfided Alinda to her, and did not think the title of son unworthy of\r\nhis acceptance; moreover, when he had captured Halicarnassus and become\r\nmaster of the rest of Caria, he granted her the privilege of ruling\r\nover the whole country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER IN LYCIA AND PAMPHYLIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the Macedonians who served in Alexander’s army had married just\r\nbefore he undertook the expedition. He thought that he ought not to\r\ntreat these men with neglect, and therefore sent them back from Caria\r\nto spend the winter in Macedonia with their wives. He placed them under\r\nthe command of Ptolemy, son of Seleucus, one of the royal body-guards,\r\nand of the two generals Coenus, son of Polemocrates, and Meleager, son\r\nof Neoptolemus, because they were also newly married. He gave these\r\nofficers instructions to levy as many horse and foot soldiers as they\r\ncould from the country, when they returned to him and brought back the\r\nmen who had been sent away with them. By this act more than by any\r\nother Alexander acquired popularity among the Macedonians. He also sent\r\nCleander, son of Polemocrates, to levy soldiers in Peloponnesus,[174]\r\nand Parmenio to Sardis, giving him the command of a regiment of the\r\nCavalry Companions, the Thessalian cavalry, and the rest of the Grecian\r\nallies. He ordered him to take the wagons to Sardis and to advance from\r\nthat place into Phrygia.\r\n\r\nHe himself marched towards Lycia and Pamphylia, in order to gain\r\ncommand of the coastland, and by that means render the enemy’s fleet\r\nuseless. The first place on his route was Hyparna, a strong position,\r\nhaving a garrison of Grecian mercenaries; but he took it at the first\r\nassault, and allowed the Greeks to depart from the citadel under a\r\ntruce. Then he invaded Lycia and brought over the Telmissians by\r\ncapitulation; and crossing the river Xanthus, the cities of Pinara,\r\nXanthus, Patara, and about thirty other smaller towns were surrendered\r\nto him.[175] Having accomplished this, though it was now the very depth\r\nof winter, he invaded the land called Milyas,[176] which is a part of\r\nGreat Phrygia, but at that time paid tribute to Lycia, according to\r\nan arrangement made by the Great King. Hither came envoys from the\r\nPhaselites,[177] to treat for his friendship, and to crown him with\r\na golden crown; and the majority of the maritime Lycians also sent\r\nheralds to him as ambassadors to treat for the same object. He ordered\r\nthe Phaselites and Lycians to surrender their cities to those who were\r\ndespatched by him to receive them; and they were all surrendered. He\r\nsoon afterwards arrived himself at Phaselis, and helped the men of\r\nthat city to capture a strong fort which had been constructed by the\r\nPisidians to overawe the country; and sallying forth from which those\r\nbarbarians used to inflict much damage upon the Phaselites who tilled\r\nthe land.[178]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTREASON OF ALEXANDER, SON OF AËROPUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the king was still near Phaselis he received information that\r\nAlexander, son of Aëropus, who was not only one of the Companions, but\r\nalso at that time commander of the Thessalian horse, was conspiring\r\nagainst him. This Alexander was brother of Heromenes and Arrhabaeus,\r\nwho had taken part in the murder of Philip.[179] At that time King\r\nAlexander pardoned him, though he was accused of complicity with them,\r\nbecause after Philip’s death he was among the first of his friends to\r\ncome to him, and, helping him on with his breastplate, accompanied him\r\nto the palace. The king afterwards showed him honour at his court,\r\nsent him as general into Thrace; and when Calas the commander of the\r\nThessalian horse was sent away to a viceroyalty[180] he was appointed\r\nto succeed that general. The details of the conspiracy were reported\r\nas follows: When Amyntas deserted to Darius,[181] he conveyed to\r\nhim certain messages and a letter from this Alexander. Darius then\r\nsent Sisines, one of his own faithful Persian courtiers, down to the\r\nsea-coast, under pretence of going to Atizyes, viceroy of Phrygia, but\r\nreally to communicate with this Alexander, and to give him pledges,\r\nthat if he would kill king Alexander, Darius would appoint him king of\r\nMacedonia, and would give him 1,000 talents of gold[182] in addition\r\nto the kingdom. But Sisines, being captured by Parmenio, told him the\r\nreal object of his mission. Parmenio sent him immediately under guard\r\nto the king, who obtained the same intelligence from him. The king\r\nthen, having collected his friends, proposed to them as a subject\r\nfor deliberation what decision he ought to make in regard to this\r\nAlexander. The Companions thought that formerly he had not resolved\r\nwisely in confiding the best part of his cavalry to a faithless man,\r\nand that now it was advisable to put him out of the way as speedily as\r\npossible, before he became even more popular among the Thessalians and\r\nshould try to effect some revolutionary plan with their aid. Moreover\r\nthey were terrified by a certain divine portent. For, while Alexander\r\nthe king was still besieging Halicarnassus, it is said that he was\r\nonce taking rest at midday, when a swallow flew about over his head\r\nloudly twittering, and perched now on this side of his couch and now on\r\nthat, chirping more noisily than usual. On account of his fatigue he\r\ncould not be roused from sleep, but being disquieted by the sound he\r\nbrushed her away gently with his hand. But though struck she was so far\r\nfrom trying to escape, that she perched upon the very head of the king,\r\nand did not desist until he was wide awake. Thinking the affair of\r\nthe swallow of no trivial import, he communicated it to a soothsayer,\r\nAristander the Telmissian,[183] who told him that it signified a plot\r\nformed by one of his friends. He said it also signified that the plot\r\nwould be discovered, because the swallow was a bird fond of man’s\r\nsociety and well disposed to him as well as more loquacious than any\r\nother bird. Therefore, comparing this with the depositions of the\r\nPersian, the king sent Amphoterus, son of Alexander and brother of\r\nCraterus to Parmenio; and with him he sent some Pergaeans to show him\r\nthe way. Amphoterus, putting on a native dress, so that he should not\r\nbe recognised on the road, reached Parmenio by stealth. He did not\r\ncarry a letter from Alexander, because it did not appear to the king\r\nadvisable to write openly about such a matter; but he reported the\r\nmessage entrusted to him by word of mouth. Consequently this Alexander\r\nwas arrested and kept under guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER IN PAMPHYLIA.—CAPTURE OF ASPENDUS AND SIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander then, moving from Phaselis, sent part of his army to Perga\r\nthrough the mountains, where the Thracians had levelled a road for him\r\nby a route which was otherwise difficult and long. But he himself led\r\nhis own brigade by the beach along the sea, where there is no route,\r\nexcept when the north wind blows. But if the south wind prevails it is\r\nimpossible to journey along the beach. At that time, after a strong\r\nsouth wind, the north winds blew, and rendered his passage easy and\r\nquick, not without the divine intervention, as both he and his men\r\ninterpreted.[184] As he was advancing from Perga, he was met on the\r\nroad by envoys from the Aspendians[185] with full powers, who offered\r\nto surrender their city, but begged him not lead a garrison into it.\r\nHaving gained their request in regard to the garrison, they went back;\r\nbut he ordered them to give him fifty talents[186] as pay for his army,\r\nas well as the horses which they were rearing as tribute to Darius.\r\nHaving agreed with him about the money, and having likewise promised to\r\nhand over the horses, they departed.\r\n\r\nAlexander then marched to Sidē,[187] the inhabitants of which were\r\nCymaeans from Cyme, in Aeolis. These people give the following account\r\nof themselves, saying that their ancestors starting from Cyme,\r\narrived in that country, and disembarked to found a settlement. They\r\nimmediately forgot the Grecian language, and forthwith began to utter a\r\nforeign speech, not, indeed, that of the neighbouring barbarians, but\r\na speech peculiar to themselves, which had never before existed. From\r\nthat time the Sidetans used to speak a foreign language unlike that of\r\nthe neighbouring nations. Having left a garrison in Sidē, Alexander\r\nadvanced to Syllium,[188] a strong place, containing a garrison of\r\nGrecian mercenaries as well as of native barbarians themselves. But\r\nhe was unable to take Syllium offhand by a sudden assault, for he\r\nwas informed on his march that the Aspendians refused to perform any\r\nof their agreements, and would neither deliver the horses to those\r\nwho were sent to receive them, nor pay the money; but that they had\r\ncollected their property out of the fields into the city, shut their\r\ngates against his men, and were repairing their walls where they had\r\nbecome dilapidated. Hearing this, he marched off to Aspendus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER IN PHRYGIA AND PISIDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Aspendus had been built upon a strong and\r\nprecipitous rock, at the very foot of which flows the river\r\nEurymedon[189]; but round the rock, on the low ground, were many of\r\nthe citizens’ houses, surrounded by a small wall. As soon as they\r\nascertained that Alexander was approaching, the inhabitants deserted\r\nthe wall and the houses situated on the low ground, which they thought\r\nthey were unable to protect; and they fled in a body to the rock. When\r\nhe arrived with his forces, he passed within the deserted wall and\r\ntook up his quarters in the houses which had been abandoned by the\r\nAspendians. When these saw that Alexander himself had come, contrary to\r\ntheir expectation, and that his camp was encircling them on all sides,\r\nthey sent envoys to him, entreating him to form an agreement with them\r\non the former terms. Alexander, considering the strength of the place,\r\nand how unprepared he was to undertake a long siege, entered into an\r\nagreement with them, though not on the same terms as before. For he\r\nordered them to give him their most influential men as hostages, to\r\nhand over the horses which they had formerly agreed to give him, to pay\r\n100 talents instead of fifty, to obey the viceroy appointed by him, and\r\nto pay an annual tribute to the Macedonians. Moreover he directed an\r\ninquiry to be held about the land which they were accused of holding by\r\nforce, though it belonged of right to their neighbours.\r\n\r\nWhen all these concessions had been made to him, he marched away to\r\nPerga, and thence set out for Phrygia, his route leading him past the\r\ncity of Termessus. The people of this city are foreigners, of the\r\nPisidian race, inhabiting a very lofty place, precipitous on every\r\nside; so that the road to the city is a difficult one. For a mountain\r\nstretches from the city as far as the road, where it suddenly stops\r\nshort; and over against it rises another mountain, no less precipitous.\r\nThese mountains form gates, as it were, upon the road; and it is\r\npossible for those who occupy these eminences even with a small guard\r\nto render the passage impracticable. On this occasion the Termissians\r\nhad come out in a body, and were occupying both the mountains; seeing\r\nwhich, Alexander ordered the Macedonians to encamp there, armed as they\r\nwere, imagining that the Termissians would not remain in a body when\r\nthey saw them bivouacking, but that most of them would withdraw into\r\ntheir city, which was near, leaving upon the mountains only sufficient\r\nmen to form a guard. And it turned out just as he conjectured; for\r\nmost of them retired, and only a guard remained. He forthwith took the\r\narchers, the regiments of javelin-throwers, and the lighter hoplites,\r\nand led them against those who were guarding the pass. When these were\r\nattacked with missiles, they did not stand their ground, but abandoned\r\nthe position. Alexander then passed through the defile, and encamped\r\nnear the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS IN PISIDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he was there, ambassadors came to him from the Selgians, who are\r\nalso Pisidian barbarians, inhabiting a large city, and being warlike.\r\nBecause they happened to be inveterate enemies to the Termessians they\r\nhad despatched this embassy to Alexander, to treat for his friendship.\r\nHe made a treaty with them, and from this time found them faithful\r\nallies in all his proceedings. Despairing of being able to capture\r\nTermessus without a great loss of time, he marched on to Sagalassus.\r\nThis was also a large city, inhabited likewise by Pisidians; and though\r\nall the Pisidians are warlike, the men of this city were deemed the\r\nmost so. On this occasion they had occupied the hill in front of the\r\ncity, because it was no less strong than the walls, from which to\r\nattack the enemy; and there they were awaiting him. But Alexander drew\r\nup the phalanx of Macedonians in the following way: on the right wing,\r\nwhere he had himself taken up his position, he held the shield-bearing\r\nguards, and next to these he extended the foot Companions as far as\r\nthe left wing, in the order that each of the generals had precedence\r\nin the array that day. On the left wing he stationed Amyntas, son of\r\nArrhabaeus, as commander. In front of the right wing were posted the\r\narchers and Agrianians, and in front of the left wing the Thracian\r\njavelin-throwers under the command of Sitalces. But the cavalry were\r\nno use to him in a place so rough and unfavourable. The Termessians\r\nalso had come to the aid of the Pisidians, and arrayed themselves with\r\nthem. Alexander had already made an attack upon the mountain which the\r\nPisidians were occupying, advancing up the most abrupt part of the\r\nascent, when the barbarians from an ambuscade attacked him on both\r\nwings, in a place where it was very easy for themselves to advance,\r\nbut where the route was very difficult for their enemy. The archers,\r\nwho were the first to approach, were put to rout, inasmuch as they\r\nwere insufficiently armed; but the Agrianians stood their ground, for\r\nthe Macedonian phalanx was already drawing near, at the head of which\r\nAlexander himself was seen. When the battle became a hand-to-hand one,\r\nthough the barbarians were destitute of armour, they rushed against\r\nthe Macedonian hoplites, and fell wounded on all sides. Then, indeed,\r\nthey gave way, after about 500 of them had been killed. As they were\r\nnimble and well-acquainted with the locality, they effected their\r\nretreat without difficulty; whereas the Macedonians, on account of\r\nthe heaviness of their arms and their ignorance of the roads, durst\r\nnot pursue them vigorously. Alexander therefore held off from the\r\nfugitives, and took their city by storm. Of those with him, Cleander,\r\nthe general of the archers, and about twenty others were slain.\r\nAlexander then marched against the rest of the Pisidians, and took some\r\nof their strongholds by storm; others he won over to him by granting\r\nthem terms of capitulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER IN PHRYGIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThence he went into Phrygia, passing by the lake called Ascania,[190]\r\nin which salt is naturally concreted. The natives use this salt, and\r\ndo not need the sea at all for this article. On the fifth day of\r\nhis march, he arrived at Celaenae,[191] in which city there was a\r\nfortified rock, precipitous on all sides. This citadel was occupied\r\nby the viceroy of Phrygia with a garrison of 1,000 Carians and 100\r\nGrecian mercenaries. These men despatched ambassadors to Alexander,\r\npromising to surrender the place to him, if succour did not reach them\r\nby a day which had been agreed upon with them, naming the day.[192]\r\nThis arrangement seemed to Alexander more advantageous than to besiege\r\nthe fortified rock, which was inaccessible on all sides to attack.\r\nAt Celaenae he left a garrison of 1,500 soldiers. Remaining here ten\r\ndays, he appointed Antigonus, son of Philip,[193] viceroy of Phrygia,\r\nplaced Balacrus, son of Amyntas[194] as general over the Grecian allies\r\nin place of Antigonus, and then directed his march to Gordium.[195]\r\nHe sent an order to Parmenio to meet him there with the forces under\r\nhis command; an order which that general obeyed. The newly-married men\r\nalso, who had been despatched to Macedonia, now arrived at Gordium, and\r\nwith them another army which had been levied, and put under the command\r\nof Ptolemy, son of Seleucus,[196] Coenus, son of Polemocrates, and\r\nMeleager, son of Neoptolemus. This army consisted of 3,000 Macedonian\r\nfoot-soldiers and 300 horse-soldiers, 200 Thessalian cavalry, and 150\r\nEleans under the command of Alcias the Elean.\r\n\r\nGordium is in the Phrygia which lies near the Hellespont, and is\r\nsituated upon the river Sangarius, which takes its rise in Phrygia,\r\nbut, flowing through the land of the Bithynian Thracians, falls into\r\nthe Euxine Sea. Here an embassy reached Alexander from the Athenians,\r\nbeseeching him to release to them the Athenian prisoners who had been\r\ncaptured at the river Granicus, fighting for the Persians, and were\r\nthen in Macedonia serving in chains with the two thousand others\r\ncaptured in that battle. The envoys departed without obtaining their\r\nrequest on behalf of the prisoners for the present. For Alexander\r\ndid not think it safe, whilst the war against the Persian was still\r\ngoing on, to relax in the slightest degree the terror with which he\r\ninspired the Greeks, who did not deem it unbecoming for them to serve\r\nas soldiers on behalf of the foreigners against Greece. However, he\r\nreplied that whenever his present enterprise had been successfully\r\nachieved, they might then come as ambassadors to treat on behalf of the\r\nsame persons.[197]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF MITYLENE BY THE PERSIANS.—DEATH OF MEMNON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after this, Memnon, whom King Darius had appointed commander of\r\nthe whole fleet and of the entire sea-coast, with the design of moving\r\nthe seat of war into Macedonia and Greece, acquired possession of\r\nChios, which was surrendered to him by treachery. Thence he sailed to\r\nLesbos and brought over to his side all the cities of the island,[198]\r\nexcept Mitylene, the inhabitants of which did not submit to him. When\r\nhe had gained these cities over, he turned his attention to Mitylene;\r\nand walling off the city from the rest of the island by constructing\r\na double stockade from sea to sea, he easily got the mastery on the\r\nland side by building five camps. A part of his fleet guarded their\r\nharbour, and, intercepting the ships passing by, he kept the rest of\r\nhis fleet as a guard off Sigrium,[199] the headland of Lesbos, where is\r\nthe best landing-place for trading vessels from Chios, Geraestus,[200]\r\nand Malea.[201] By this means he deprived the Mitylenaeans of all hope\r\nof succour by sea. But meantime he himself fell ill and died, and his\r\ndeath at that crisis was exceedingly injurious to the king’s interests.\r\nNevertheless Autophradates, and Pharnabazus, son of Artabazus,\r\nprosecuted the siege with vigour. To the latter indeed, Memnon, when\r\ndying, had entrusted his command, as he was his sister’s son, till\r\nDarius should come to some decision on the matter. The Mitylenaeans,\r\ntherefore, being excluded from the land, and being blockaded on the\r\nsea by many ships lying at anchor, sent to Pharnabazus and came to\r\nthe following agreement:—That the auxiliary troops which had come\r\nto their aid from Alexander should depart, that the citizens should\r\ndemolish the pillars on which the treaty made by them with Alexander\r\nwas inscribed,[202] that they should become allies of Darius on the\r\nterms of the peace which was made with King Darius in the time of\r\nAntalcidas,[203] and that their exiles should return from banishment\r\non condition of receiving back half the property which they possessed\r\nwhen they were banished. Upon these terms the compact was made between\r\nthe Mitylenaeans and the Persians. But as soon as Pharnabazus and\r\nAutophradates once got within the city, they introduced a garrison with\r\nLycomedes, a Rhodian, as its commandant. They also appointed Diogenes,\r\none of the exiles, to be despot of the city, and exacted money from the\r\nMitylenaeans, taking part of it by violence for themselves from the\r\nwealthy citizens, and laying the rest as a tax upon the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PERSIANS CAPTURE TENEDUS.—THEY ARE DEFEATED AT SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter accomplishing this, Pharnabazus sailed to Lycia, taking with\r\nhim the Grecian mercenaries; but Autophradates sailed to the other\r\nislands. Meantime Darius sent Thymondas, son of Mentor,[204] down to\r\nthe maritime districts, to take over the Grecian auxiliaries from\r\nPharnabazus and to lead them up to him; and to tell Pharnabazus that\r\nhe was to be the ruler of all that Memnon had ruled. So Pharnabazus\r\nhanded over to him the Grecian auxiliaries and then sailed to join\r\nAutophradates and the fleet. When they met, they despatched Datames,\r\na Persian, with ten ships to the islands called Cyclades,[205] whilst\r\nthey with 100 sailed to Tenedus.[206] Having sailed into the harbour of\r\nTenedus which is called Borēus, they sent a message to the inhabitants,\r\ncommanding them to demolish the pillars on which the treaty made by\r\nthem with Alexander and the Greeks was inscribed, and to observe in\r\nregard to Darius the terms of the peace which they had ratified with\r\nthe king of Persia in the time of Antalcidas. The Tenedians preferred\r\nto be on terms of amity with Alexander and the Greeks; but in the\r\npresent crisis it seemed impossible to save themselves except by\r\nyielding to the Persians, since Hegelochus, who had been commissioned\r\nby Alexander to collect another naval force, had not yet gathered so\r\nlarge a fleet as to warrant them in expecting any speedy succour from\r\nhim. Accordingly Pharnabazus made the Tenedians comply with his demands\r\nrather from fear than good-will.\r\n\r\nMeantime Proteas, son of Andronicus, by command of Antipater,[207]\r\nsucceeded in collecting ships of war from Euboea and the Peloponnese,\r\nso that there might be some protection both for the islands and for\r\nGreece itself, if the foreigners attacked them by sea, as it was\r\nreported they intended to do. Learning that Datames with ten ships was\r\nmoored near Siphnus,[208] Proteas set out by night with fifteen from\r\nChalcis on the Euripus,[209] and approaching the island of Cythnus[210]\r\nat dawn, he spent the day there in order to get more certain\r\ninformation of the movements of the ten ships, resolving at the same\r\ntime to fall upon the Phoenicians by night, when he would be likely\r\nto strike them with greater terror. Having discovered with certainty\r\nthat Datames was moored with his ships at Siphnus, he sailed thither\r\nwhile it was still dark, and just at the very dawn fell upon them when\r\nthey least expected it, and captured eight of the ships, men and all.\r\nBut Datames, with the other two triremes, escaped by stealth at the\r\nbeginning of the attack made by the ships with Proteas, and reached the\r\nrest of the Persian fleet in safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER AT GORDIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander arrived at Gordium, he was seized with an ardent desire\r\nto go up into the citadel, which contained the palace of Gordius and\r\nhis son Midas. He was also desirous of seeing the wagon of Gordius and\r\nthe cord which bound the yoke to the wagon. There was a great deal of\r\ntalk about this wagon among the neighbouring population. It was said\r\nthat Gordius was a poor man among the ancient Phrygians, who had a\r\nsmall piece of land to till, and two yoke of oxen. He used one of these\r\nin ploughing and the other to draw the wagon. On one occasion, while\r\nhe was ploughing, an eagle settled upon the yoke,[211] and remained\r\nsitting there until the time came for unyoking the oxen. Being alarmed\r\nat the sight, he went to the Telmissian soothsayers to consult them\r\nabout the sign from the deity; for the Telmissians were skilful in\r\ninterpreting the meaning of Divine manifestations, and the power of\r\ndivination has been bestowed not only upon the men, but also upon\r\ntheir wives and children from generation to generation. When Gordius\r\nwas driving his wagon near a certain village of the Telmissians, he\r\nmet a maiden fetching water from the spring, and to her he related how\r\nthe sign of the eagle had appeared to him. As she herself was of the\r\nprophetic race, she instructed him to return to the very spot and offer\r\nsacrifice to Zeus the king. Gordius requested her to accompany him and\r\ndirect him how to perform the sacrifice. He offered the sacrifice in\r\nthe way the girl suggested, and afterwards married her. A son was born\r\nto them named Midas, who, when he arrived at the age of maturity, was\r\nboth handsome and valiant. At this time the Phrygians were harassed by\r\ncivil discord, and consulting the oracle, they were told that a wagon\r\nwould bring them a king, who would put an end to their discord.[212]\r\nWhile they were still deliberating about this very matter, Midas\r\narrived with his father and mother, and stopped near the assembly with\r\nthe very wagon in question. They, interpreting the oracular response to\r\nrefer to him, decided that this was the person whom the god told them\r\nthe wagon would bring. They therefore appointed Midas king; and he,\r\nputting an end to their discord, dedicated his father’s wagon in the\r\ncitadel as a thank-offering to Zeus the king for sending the eagle. In\r\naddition to this the following report was current concerning the wagon,\r\nthat whosoever could loosen the cord with which the yoke of the wagon\r\nwas tied, was destined to be the ruler of Asia. The cord was made of\r\ncornel bark, and neither end nor beginning to it could be seen. It is\r\nsaid by some that when Alexander could find out no way to loosen the\r\ncord and yet was unwilling to allow it to remain unloosened, lest it\r\nshould exercise some disturbing influence upon the multitude, he struck\r\nthe cord with his sword and cut it through, saying that it had been\r\nuntied by him. But Aristobulus says that he pulled out the pin of the\r\nwagon-pole, which was a wooden peg driven right through it, holding\r\nthe cord together. Having done this, he drew out the yoke from the\r\nwagon-pole. How Alexander performed the feat in connection with this\r\ncord, I cannot affirm with confidence. At any rate both he and his\r\ntroops departed from the wagon as if the oracular prediction concerning\r\nthe untying of the cord had been fulfilled. Moreover, that very night,\r\nthe thunder and lightning were signs from heaven of its fulfilment; and\r\nfor this reason Alexander offered sacrifice on the following day to the\r\ngods who had revealed the signs and assured him that the cord had been\r\nuntied in a proper way.[213]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF CAPPADOCIA.—ALEXANDER’S ILLNESS AT TARSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day he sent out to Ancyra[214] in Galatia, where he was met by\r\nan embassy from the Paphlagonians, offering to surrender their nation\r\nto him and to enter into an alliance with him; but they requested him\r\nnot to invade their land with his forces. He therefore commanded them\r\nto submit to the authority of Calas, the viceroy of Phrygia. Marching\r\nthence into Cappadocia, he subjugated all that part of it which lies on\r\nthis side of the river Halys,[215] and much of that which lies beyond\r\nit. Having appointed Sabictas viceroy of Cappadocia, he advanced to\r\nthe Gates of Cilicia,[216] and when he arrived at the Camp of Cyrus,\r\nwho (went) with Xenophon,[217] and saw that the Gates were occupied by\r\nstrong guards, he left Parmenio there with the regiments of infantry\r\nwhich were more heavily armed; and about the first watch, taking the\r\nshield-bearing guards, the archers, and the Agrianians, he advanced by\r\nnight to the Gates, in order to fall upon the guards when they least\r\nexpected it. However, his advance was not unobserved; but his boldness\r\nserved him equally well, for the guards, perceiving that Alexander was\r\nadvancing in person, deserted their post and set off in flight. At dawn\r\nnext day he passed through the Gates with all his forces and descended\r\ninto Cilicia.[218] Here he was informed that Arsames had previously\r\nintended to preserve Tarsus for the Persians; but when he heard that\r\nAlexander had already passed through the Gates, he resolved to abandon\r\nthe city; and that the Tarsians were therefore afraid he would turn to\r\nplunder their city and afterwards evacuate it. Hearing this, Alexander\r\nled his cavalry and the lightest of his light infantry to Tarsus with\r\na forced march; consequently Arsames, hearing of his start, fled with\r\nspeed from Tarsus to King Darius without inflicting any injury upon the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nAlexander now fell ill from the toils he had undergone, according\r\nto the account of Aristobulus; but other authors say that while he\r\nwas very hot and in profuse perspiration he leaped into the river\r\nCydnus[219] and swam, being eager to bathe in its water. This river\r\nflows through the midst of the city; and as its source is in mount\r\nTaurus and it flows through a clean district, it is cold and its water\r\nis clear. Alexander therefore was seized with convulsions, accompanied\r\nwith high fever and continuous sleeplessness. None of the physicians\r\nthought he was likely to survive,[220] except Philip, an Acarnanian,\r\na physician in attendance on the king, and very much trusted by him\r\nin medical matters, who also enjoyed a great reputation in the army\r\nin general affairs. This man wished to administer a purgative draught\r\nto Alexander, and the king ordered him to administer it. While Philip\r\nwas preparing the cup, a letter was given to the king from Parmenio,\r\nwarning him to beware of Philip; for he heard that the physician had\r\nbeen bribed by Darius to poison Alexander with medicine. But he, having\r\nread the letter, and still holding it in his hand, took the cup which\r\ncontained the medicine and gave Philip the letter to read. While Philip\r\nwas reading the news from Parmenio, Alexander drank the potion. It was\r\nat once evident to the king that the physician was acting honourably\r\nin giving the medicine, for he was not alarmed at the letter, but only\r\nso much the more exhorted the king to obey all the other prescriptions\r\nwhich he might give, promising that his life would be saved if he\r\nobeyed his instructions. Alexander was purged by the draught, and his\r\nillness then took a favourable turn. He afterwards proved to Philip\r\nthat he was a faithful friend to him; and to the rest of those about\r\nhe proved that he had perfect confidence in his friends by refusing\r\nto entertain any suspicion of their fidelity; and at the same time he\r\nshowed that he could meet death with dauntless courage.[221]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER AT THE TOMB OF SARDANAPALUS.—PROCEEDINGS IN CILICIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this he sent Parmenio to the other Gates which separate the land\r\nof the Cilicians from that of the Assyrians, in order to capture them\r\nbefore the enemy could do so, and to guard the pass.[222] He gave\r\nhim the allied infantry, the Grecian mercenaries, the Thracians who\r\nwere under the command of Sitalces, and the Thessalian cavalry. He\r\nafterwards marched from Tarsus, and on the first day arrived at the\r\ncity of Anchialus.[223] According to report, this city was founded by\r\nSardanapalus the Assyrian;[224] and both from the circumference and\r\nfrom the foundations of the walls it is evident that a large city had\r\nbeen founded and that it had reached a great pitch of power. Also near\r\nthe wall of Anchialus was the monument of Sardanapalus, upon the top\r\nof which stood the statue of that king with the hands joined to each\r\nother just as they are joined for clapping.[225] An inscription had\r\nbeen placed upon it in Assyrian characters,[226] which the Assyrians\r\nasserted to be in metre. The meaning which the words expressed was\r\nthis:—“Sardanapalus, son of Anacyndaraxas, built Anchialus and Tarsus\r\nin one day; but do thou, O stranger, eat, drink, and play, since all\r\nother human things are not worth this!” referring, as in a riddle, to\r\nthe empty sound which the hands make in clapping. It was also said that\r\nthe word translated _play_ had been expressed by a more lewd one in the\r\nAssyrian language.\r\n\r\nFrom Anchialus Alexander went to Soli,[227] into which city he\r\nintroduced a garrison, and imposed upon the inhabitants a fine of 200\r\ntalents of silver,[228] because they were more inclined to favour\r\nthe Persians than himself. Then, having taken three regiments of\r\nMacedonian infantry, all the archers, and the Agrianians, he marched\r\naway thence against the Cilicians, who were holding the mountains;\r\nand in seven days in all, having expelled some by force, and having\r\nbrought the rest over by composition, he marched back to Soli. Here he\r\nascertained that Ptolemy and Asander[229] had gained the mastery over\r\nOrontobates the Persian who was guarding the citadel of Halicarnassus,\r\nand was also holding Myndus, Caunus, Thera, and Callipolis.[230] Cos\r\nand Triopium[231] also had been brought into subjection. They wrote\r\nto inform him that Orontobates had been worsted in a great battle;\r\nthat about 700 of his infantry and 50 of his cavalry had been killed,\r\nand not less than 1,000 taken prisoners. In Soli Alexander offered\r\nsacrifice to Asclepius,[232] conducting a procession of the entire\r\narmy, celebrating a torch race, and superintending a gymnastic and\r\nmusical contest. He granted the Solians the privilege of a democratical\r\nconstitution; and then marched away to Tarsus, despatching the\r\ncavalry under Philotas to march through the Aleian plain to the\r\nriver Pyramus.[233] But he himself with the infantry and the royal\r\nsquadron of cavalry came to Magarsus, where he offered sacrifice to\r\nthe Magarsian Athena. Thence he marched to Mallus, where he rendered\r\nto Amphilochus the sacrificial honours due to a hero.[234] He also\r\narrested those who were creating a sedition among the citizens, and\r\nthus put a stop to it. He remitted the tribute which they were paying\r\nto King Darius, because the Malliotes were a colony of the Argives, and\r\nhe himself claimed to have sprung from Argos, being a descendant of\r\nHeracles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER ADVANCES TO MYRIANDRUS.—DARIUS MARCHES AGAINST HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he was still at Mallus, he was informed that Darius was encamped\r\nwith all his forces at Sochi, a place in the land of Assyria, distant\r\nabout two days’ march from the Assyrian Gates.[235] Then indeed he\r\ncollected the Companions and told them what was reported about Darius\r\nand his army. They urged him to lead them on as they were, without\r\ndelay. At that time he commended them, and broke up the conference; but\r\nnext day he led them forward against Darius and the Persians. On the\r\nsecond day he passed through the Gates and encamped near the city of\r\nMyriandrus;[236] but in the night a heavy tempest and a violent storm\r\nof wind and rain occurred which detained him in his camp. Darius, on\r\nthe other hand, had been spending a long time with his army, having\r\nchosen a plain in the land of Assyria which stretches out in every\r\ndirection, suitable for the immense size of his army and convenient for\r\nthe evolutions of cavalry. Amyntas, son of Antiochus, the deserter from\r\nAlexander, advised him not to abandon this position, because there was\r\nplenty of room for the great multitude of the Persians and for the vast\r\nquantity of their baggage. So Darius remained. But as Alexander made a\r\nlong stay at Tarsus on account of his illness, and not a short one at\r\nSoli, where he offered sacrifice and conducted his army in procession,\r\nand moreover spent some time in marching against the Cilician\r\nmountaineers, Darius was induced to swerve from his resolution. He\r\nwas also not unwilling to be led to form whatever decision was most\r\nagreeable to his own wishes; and being influenced by those who gave\r\nhim the advice which they thought would be pleasant to him, without\r\nconsideration of its utility (for kings will always have associates to\r\ngive them bad advice),[237] he came to the conclusion that Alexander\r\nwas no longer desirous of advancing further, but was shrinking from an\r\nencounter on learning that Darius himself was marching against him.\r\nOn all sides they were urging him on, asserting that he would trample\r\ndown the army of the Macedonians with his cavalry.[238] Nevertheless,\r\nAmyntas, at any rate, confidently affirmed that Alexander would\r\ncertainly come to any place where he heard Darius might be; and he\r\nexhorted him by all means to stay where he was. But the worse advice,\r\nbecause at the immediate time it was more pleasant to hear, prevailed;\r\nmoreover he was led by some divine influence into that locality where\r\nhe derived little advantage from his cavalry and from the sheer number\r\nof his men, javelins and bows, and where he could not even exhibit the\r\nmere magnificence of his army, but surrendered to Alexander and his\r\ntroops an easy victory. For it was already decreed by fate that the\r\nPersians should be deprived of the rule of Asia by the Macedonians,\r\njust as the Medes had been deprived of it by the Persians, and still\r\nearlier the Assyrians by the Medes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDARIUS AT ISSUS.—ALEXANDER’S SPEECH TO HIS ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarius crossed the mountain range by what are called the Amanic Gates,\r\nand advancing towards Issus, came without being noticed to the rear\r\nof Alexander.[239] Having reached Issus, he captured as many of the\r\nMacedonians as had been left behind there on account of illness.\r\nThese he cruelly mutilated and slew. Next day he proceeded to the\r\nriver Pinarus. As soon as Alexander heard that Darius was in his rear,\r\nbecause the news did not seem to him trustworthy, he embarked some of\r\nthe Companions in a ship with thirty oars, and sent them back to Issus,\r\nto observe whether the report was true. The men who sailed in the\r\nthirty-oared ship discovered the Persians encamped there more easily,\r\nbecause the sea in this part takes the form of a bay. They therefore\r\nbrought back word to Alexander that Darius was at hand. Alexander\r\nthen called together the generals, the commanders of cavalry, and the\r\nleaders of the Grecian allies, and exhorted them to take courage from\r\nthe dangers which they had already surmounted, asserting that the\r\nstruggle would be between themselves who had been previously victorious\r\nand a foe who had already been beaten; and that the deity was acting\r\nthe part of general on their behalf better than himself, by putting\r\nit into the mind of Darius to move his forces from the spacious plain\r\nand shut them up in a narrow place, where there was sufficient room\r\nfor them to deepen their phalanx by marching from front to rear, but\r\nwhere their vast multitude would be useless to their enemy in battle.\r\nHe added that their foes were similar to them neither in strength nor\r\nin courage; for the Macedonians, who had long been practised in warlike\r\ntoils accompanied with danger, were coming into close conflict with\r\nPersians and Medes, men who had become enervated by a long course of\r\nluxurious ease; and, to crown all, they, being freemen, were about to\r\nengage in battle with men who were slaves. He said, moreover, that\r\nthe Greeks who were in the two armies would not be fighting for the\r\nsame objects; for those with Darius were braving danger for pay,\r\nand that pay not high; whereas, those on their side were voluntarily\r\ndefending the interests of Greece. Again, of foreigners, the Thracians,\r\nPaeonians, Illyrians, and Agrianians, who were the most robust and\r\nwarlike of men in Europe, were about to be arrayed against the most\r\nsluggish and effeminate races of Asia. In addition to all this,\r\nAlexander was commanding in the field against Darius. These things\r\nhe enumerated as evidences of their superiority in the struggle; and\r\nthen he began to point out the great rewards they would win from the\r\ndanger to be incurred. For he told them that on that occasion they\r\nwould overcome, not merely the viceroys of Darius, nor the cavalry\r\ndrawn up at the Granicus, nor the 20,000 Grecian mercenaries, but would\r\novercome all the available forces of the Persians and Medes, as well\r\nas all the other races subject to them dwelling in Asia, and the Great\r\nKing present in person. After this conflict nothing would be left for\r\nthem to do, except to take possession of all Asia, and to put an end\r\nto their many labours. In addition to this, he reminded them of their\r\nbrilliant achievements in their collective capacity in days gone by;\r\nand if any man had individually performed any distinguished feat of\r\nvalour from love of glory, he mentioned him by name in commendation\r\nof the deed.[240] He then recapitulated as modestly as possible his\r\nown daring deeds in the various battles. He is also said to have\r\nreminded them of Xenophon and the ten thousand men who accompanied him,\r\nasserting that the latter were in no way comparable with them either\r\nin number or in general excellence. Besides, they had had with them\r\nneither Thessalian, Boeotian, Peloponnesian, Macedonian, or Thracian\r\nhorsemen, nor any of the other cavalry which was in the Macedonian\r\narmy; nor had they any archers or slingers except a few Cretans and\r\nRhodians, and even these were got ready by Xenophon on the spur of\r\nthe moment in the very crisis of danger.[241] And yet even these put\r\nthe king and all his forces to rout close to Babylon[242] itself, and\r\nsucceeded in reaching the Euxine Sea after defeating all the races\r\nwhich lay in their way as they were marching down thither. He also\r\nadduced whatever other arguments were suitable for a great commander to\r\nuse in order to encourage brave men in such a critical moment before\r\nthe perils of battle. They urged him to lead them against the foe\r\nwithout delay, coming from all sides to grasp the king’s right hand,\r\nand encouraging him by their promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF THE HOSTILE ARMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander then ordered his soldiers to take their dinner, and having\r\nsent a few of his horsemen and archers forward to the Gates to\r\nreconnoitre the road in the rear, he took the whole of his army and\r\nmarched in the night to occupy the pass again. When about midnight\r\nhe had again got possession of it, he caused the army to rest the\r\nremainder of the night there upon the rocks, having posted vigilant\r\nsentries. At the approach of dawn he began to descend from the pass\r\nalong the road; and as long as the space was narrow everywhere, he led\r\nhis army in column, but when the mountains parted so as to leave a\r\nplain between them, he kept on opening out the column into the phalanx,\r\nmarching one line of heavy armed infantry after another up into line\r\ntowards the mountain on the right and towards the sea on the left.\r\nUp to this time his cavalry had been ranged behind the infantry; but\r\nwhen they advanced into the open country, he began to draw up his army\r\nin order of battle. First, upon the right wing near the mountain he\r\nplaced his infantry guard and the shield-bearers, under the command of\r\nNicanor, son of Parmenio; next to these the regiment of Coenus, and\r\nclose to them that of Perdiccas. These troops were posted as far as the\r\nmiddle of the heavy-armed infantry to one beginning from the right.\r\nOn the left wing first stood the regiment of Amyntas, then that of\r\nPtolemy, and close to this that of Meleager. The infantry on the left\r\nhad been placed under the command of Craterus; but Parmenio held the\r\nchief direction of the whole left wing. This general had been ordered\r\nnot to abandon the sea, so that they might not be surrounded by the\r\nforeigners, who were likely to outflank them on all sides by their\r\nsuperior numbers.[243]\r\n\r\nBut as soon as Darius was certified of Alexander’s approach for battle,\r\nhe conveyed about 30,000 of his cavalry and with them 20,000 of his\r\nlight-armed infantry across the river Pinarus, in order that he might\r\nbe able to draw up the rest of his forces with ease. Of the heavy\r\narmed infantry, he placed first the 30,000 Greek mercenaries to oppose\r\nthe phalanx of the Macedonians, and on both sides of these he placed\r\n60,000 of the men called Cardaces,[244] who were also heavy-armed\r\ninfantry.[245] For the place where they were posted was able to\r\ncontain only this number in a single phalanx.[246] He also posted\r\n20,000 men near the mountain on their left and facing Alexander’s\r\nright. Some of these troops were also in the rear of Alexander’s army;\r\nfor the mountain near which they were posted in one part sloped a\r\ngreat way back and formed a sort of bay, like a bay in the sea, and\r\nafterwards bending forwards caused the men who had been posted at the\r\nfoot of it to be behind Alexander’s right wing. The remaining multitude\r\nof Darius’s light-armed and heavy-armed infantry was marshalled by\r\nnations to an unserviceable depth and placed behind the Grecian\r\nmercenaries and the Persian army arranged in phalanx. The whole of the\r\narmy with Darius was said to number about 600,000 fighting men.[247]\r\n\r\nAs Alexander advanced, he found that the ground spread out a little\r\nin breadth, and he accordingly brought up his horsemen, both those\r\ncalled Companions, and the Thessalians as well as the Macedonians, and\r\nposted them with himself on the right wing. The Peloponnesians and the\r\nrest of the allied force of Greeks he sent to Parmenio on the left.\r\nWhen Darius had marshalled his phalanx, by a pre-concerted signal he\r\nrecalled the cavalry which he had posted in front of the river for\r\nthe express purpose of rendering the arranging of his army easy. Most\r\nof these he placed on the right wing near the sea facing Parmenio;\r\nbecause here the ground was more suitable for the evolutions of\r\ncavalry. A certain part of them also he led up to the mountain towards\r\nthe left. But when they were seen to be useless there on account of\r\nthe narrowness of the ground, he ordered most of these also to ride\r\nround to the right wing and join their comrades there. Darius himself\r\noccupied the centre of the whole army, inasmuch as it was the custom\r\nfor the kings of Persia to take up that position, the reason of which\r\narrangement has been recorded by Xenophon, son of Gryllus.[248]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER CHANGES THE DISPOSITION OF HIS FORCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime when Alexander perceived that nearly all the Persian cavalry\r\nhad changed their ground and gone to his left towards the sea, and\r\nthat on his side only the Peloponnesians and the rest of the Grecian\r\ncavalry were posted there, he sent the Thessalian cavalry thither with\r\nspeed, ordering them not to ride along before the front of the whole\r\narray, lest they should be seen by the enemy to be shifting their\r\nground, but to proceed by stealth in the rear of the phalanx.[249] In\r\nfront of the cavalry on the right, he posted the lancers under the\r\ncommand of Protomachus, and the Paeonians under that of Aristo; and of\r\nthe infantry, the archers under the direction of Antiochus, and the\r\nAgrianians under that of Attalus. Some of the cavalry and archers\r\nalso he drew up so as to form an angle with the centre[250] towards\r\nthe mountain which was in the rear; so on the right his phalanx had\r\nbeen drawn up separated into two wings, the one fronting Darius and\r\nthe main body of Persians beyond the river, and the other facing those\r\nwho had been posted at the mountain in their rear. On the left wing\r\nthe infantry consisting of the Cretan archers and the Thracians under\r\ncommand of Sitalces were posted in front; and before these the cavalry\r\ntowards the left. The Grecian mercenaries were drawn up as a reserve\r\nfor all of them. When he perceived that the phalanx towards the right\r\nwas too thin, and it seemed likely that the Persians would outflank him\r\nhere considerably, he ordered two squadrons of the Companion cavalry,\r\nviz. the Anthemusian,[251] of which Peroedas, son of Menestheus, was\r\ncaptain, and that which was called Leugaean, under the command of\r\nPantordanus, son of Cleander, to proceed from the centre to the right\r\nwithout being seen. Having also marched the archers, part of the\r\nAgrianians and of the Grecian mercenaries up along his right in the\r\nfront, he extended his phalanx beyond the wing of the Persians. But\r\nwhen those who had been posted upon the mountain did not descend, a\r\ncharge was made by a few of the Agrianians and archers at Alexander’s\r\norder, by which they were easily put to the rout from the foot of the\r\nmountain. As they fled to the summit he decided that he could make use\r\nof the men who had been drawn up to keep these in check, to fill up\r\nthe ranks of his phalanx. He thought it quite sufficient to post 300\r\nhorsemen to watch the men on the mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ISSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus marshalled his men, he caused them to rest for some time,\r\nand then led them forward, as he thought the enemy’s approach was very\r\nslow. For Darius was no longer leading the foreigners against him, as\r\nhe had arranged them at first, but he remained in his position, upon\r\nthe bank of the river, which was in many parts steep and precipitous;\r\nand in certain places, where it seemed more easy to ascend, he extended\r\na stockade along it. By this it was at once evident to Alexander’s\r\nmen that Darius had become cowed in spirit.[252] But when the armies\r\nat length met in conflict, Alexander rode about in every direction\r\nto exhort his troops to show their valour; mentioning with befitting\r\nepithets the names, not only of the generals, but also those of the\r\ncaptains of cavalry and infantry, and of the Grecian mercenaries as\r\nmany as were more distinguished either by rank or merit. From all\r\nsides arose a shout not to delay but to attack the enemy. At first he\r\nstill led them on in close array with measured step, although he had\r\nthe forces of Darius already in full view, lest by a more hasty march\r\nany part of the phalanx should fluctuate from the line[253] and get\r\nseparated from the rest. But when they came within range of darts,\r\nAlexander himself and those around him being posted on the right wing,\r\nadvanced first into the river with a run, in order to alarm the\r\nPersians by the rapidity of their onset, and by coming sooner to close\r\nconflict to receive little damage from the archers. And it turned out\r\njust as Alexander had conjectured; for as soon as the battle became a\r\nhand-to-hand one, the part of the Persian army stationed on the left\r\nwing was put to rout; and here Alexander and his men won a brilliant\r\nvictory. But the Grecian mercenaries serving under Darius attacked\r\nthe Macedonians at the point where they saw their phalanx especially\r\ndisordered. For the Macedonian phalanx had been broken and disjoined\r\ntowards the right wing; because Alexander had charged into the river\r\nwith eagerness, and engaging in a hand-to-hand conflict was already\r\ndriving back the Persians posted there; but the Macedonians in the\r\ncentre did not execute their task with equal speed; and finding many\r\nparts of the bank steep and precipitous, they were unable to preserve\r\nthe front of the phalanx in the same line. Here then the struggle was\r\ndesperate; the aim of the Grecian mercenaries of Darius being to push\r\nthe Macedonians back into the river, and regain the victory, though\r\ntheir own forces were already flying; the aim of the Macedonians being\r\nnot to fall short of Alexander’s good-fortune, which was already\r\nmanifest, and not to tarnish the glory of the phalanx, which up to that\r\ntime had been commonly asserted to be invincible. Moreover the feeling\r\nof rivalry which existed between the Grecian and Macedonian races\r\ninspired each side in the conflict. Here fell Ptolemy, son of Seleucus,\r\nafter proving himself a valiant man, besides about one hundred and\r\ntwenty other Macedonians of no mean repute.[254]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT AND FLIGHT OF DARIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHereupon the regiments on the right wing, perceiving that the Persians\r\nopposed to them had already been put to rout, wheeled round towards the\r\nGrecian mercenaries of Darius and their own hard-pressed detachment.\r\nHaving driven the Greeks away from the river, they extended their\r\nphalanx beyond the Persian army on the side which had been broken;\r\nand attacking the Greeks on the flank, were already beginning to cut\r\nthem up. However the Persian cavalry which had been posted opposite\r\nthe Thessalians did not remain on the other side of the river during\r\nthe struggle, but came through the water and made a vigorous attack\r\nupon the Thessalian squadrons.[255] In this place a fierce cavalry\r\nbattle ensued; for the Persians did not give way until they perceived\r\nthat Darius had fled and the Grecian mercenaries had been cut up by\r\nthe phalanx and severed from them. Then at last the flight of all\r\nthe Persians was plainly visible. Their horses suffered much injury\r\nin the retreat, because the riders[256] were heavily armed; and the\r\nhorsemen themselves, being so many in number and retreating in panic\r\nterror without any regard to order along narrow roads, were trampled\r\non and injured no less by each other than by the pursuing enemy. The\r\nThessalians also followed them up with vigour, so that no fewer of the\r\ncavalry than of the infantry[257] were slaughtered in the flight.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the left wing of Darius was terrified and routed by\r\nAlexander, and the Persian king perceived that this part of his army\r\nwas severed from the rest, without any further delay he began to flee\r\nin his chariot along with the first, just as he was.[258] He was\r\nconveyed safely in the chariot as long as he met with level ground in\r\nhis flight; but when he lighted upon ravines and other rough ground,\r\nhe left the chariot there, divesting himself of his shield and Median\r\nmantle. He even left his bow in the chariot; and mounting a horse\r\ncontinued his flight. The night, which came on soon after, alone\r\nrescued him from being captured by Alexander;[259] for as long as there\r\nwas daylight the latter kept up the pursuit at full speed. But when it\r\nbegan to grow dark and the ground before the feet became invisible,\r\nhe turned back again to the camp, after capturing the chariot of\r\nDarius with the shield, the Median mantle, and the bow in it.[260] For\r\nhis pursuit had been too slow for him to overtake Darius, because,\r\nthough he wheeled round at the first breaking asunder of the phalanx,\r\nyet he did not turn to pursue him until he observed that the Grecian\r\nmercenaries and the Persian cavalry had been driven away from the river.\r\n\r\nOf the Persians were killed Arsames, Rheomithres, and Atizyes who had\r\ncommanded the cavalry at the Granicus. Sabaces, viceroy of Egypt, and\r\nBubaces, one of the Persian dignitaries, were also killed, besides\r\nabout 100,000 of the private soldiers, among them being more than\r\n10,000 cavalry.[261] So great was the slaughter that Ptolemy, son of\r\nLagus, who then accompanied Alexander, says that the men who were with\r\nthem pursuing Darius, coming in the pursuit to a ravine, filled it up\r\nwith the corpses and so passed over it. The camp of Darius was taken\r\nforthwith at the first assault, containing his mother, his wife,—who\r\nwas also his sister,—and his infant son.[262] His two daughters, and\r\na few other women, wives of Persian peers,[263] who were in attendance\r\nupon them, were likewise captured. For the other Persians happened to\r\nhave despatched their women along with the rest of their property to\r\nDamascus;[264] because Darius had sent to that city the greater part\r\nof his money and all the other things which the Great King was in the\r\nhabit of taking with him as necessary for his luxurious mode of living,\r\neven though he was going on a military expedition. The consequence\r\nwas, that in the camp no more than 3,000 talents[265] were captured;\r\nand soon after, the money in Damascus was also seized by Parmenio, who\r\nwas despatched thither for that very purpose. Such was the result of\r\nthis famous battle (which was fought) in the month Maimacterion, when\r\nNicostratus was archon of the Athenians.[266]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nKIND TREATMENT OF DARIUS’S FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, Alexander, though suffering from a wound which he had\r\nreceived in the thigh from a sword, visited the wounded, and having\r\ncollected the bodies of the slain, he gave them a splendid burial with\r\nall his forces most brilliantly marshalled in order of battle. He also\r\nspoke with eulogy to those whom he himself had recognised performing\r\nany gallant deed in the battle, and also to those whose exploits he had\r\nlearnt by report fully corroborated. He likewise honoured each of them\r\nindividually with a gift of money in proportion to his desert.[267] He\r\nthen appointed Balacrus, son of Nicanor, one of the royal body-guards,\r\nviceroy of Cilicia; and in his place among the body-guards he chose\r\nMenes, son of Dionysius. In the room of Ptolemy, son of Seleucus,\r\nwho had been killed in the battle, he appointed Polysperchon, son of\r\nSimmias, to the command of a brigade. He remitted to the Solians the\r\nfifty talents[268] which were still due of the money imposed on them as\r\na fine, and he gave them back their hostages.\r\n\r\nNor did he treat the mother, wife, and children of Darius with\r\nneglect; for some of those who have written Alexander’s history say\r\nthat on the very night in which he returned from the pursuit of Darius,\r\nentering the Persian king’s tent, which had been selected for his use,\r\nhe heard the lamentation of women and other noise of a similar kind not\r\nfar from the tent. Inquiring therefore who the women were, and why they\r\nwere in a tent so near, he was answered by some one as follows:—“O\r\nking, the mother, wife, and children of Darius are lamenting for him\r\nas slain, since they have been informed that thou hast his bow and\r\nhis royal mantle, and that his shield has been brought back.” When\r\nAlexander heard this, he sent Leonnatus,[269] one of his Companions,\r\nto them, with injunctions to tell them:—“Darius is still alive; in\r\nhis flight he left his arms and mantle in the chariot; and these are\r\nthe only things of his that Alexander has.” Leonnatus entered the tent\r\nand told them the news about Darius, saying, moreover, that Alexander\r\nwould allow them to retain the state and retinue befitting their royal\r\nrank, as well as the title of queens; for he had not undertaken the\r\nwar against Darius from a feeling of hatred, but he had conducted it\r\nin a legitimate manner for the empire of Asia. Such are the statements\r\nof Ptolemy and Aristobulus.[270] But there is another report, to the\r\neffect that on the following day Alexander himself went into the tent,\r\naccompanied alone by Hephaestion, one of his Companions. The mother\r\nof Darius,[271] being in doubt which of them was the king (for they\r\nhad both arrayed themselves in the same style of dress), went up to\r\nHephaestion, because he appeared to her the taller of the two, and\r\nprostrated herself before him. But when he drew back, and one of her\r\nattendants pointed out Alexander, saying he was the king, she was\r\nashamed of her mistake, and was going to retire. But the king told her\r\nshe had made no mistake, for Hephaestion was also an Alexander. This\r\nI record neither being sure of its truth nor thinking it altogether\r\nunreliable. If it really occurred, I commend Alexander for his\r\ncompassionate treatment of the women, and the confidence he felt in\r\nhis companion, and the honour bestowed on him; but if it merely seems\r\nprobable to historians that Alexander would have acted and spoken thus,\r\neven for this reason I think him worthy of commendation.[272]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nFLIGHT OF MACEDONIAN DESERTERS INTO EGYPT.—PROCEEDINGS OF AGIS, KING\r\nOF SPARTA.—ALEXANDER OCCUPIES PHOENICIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarius fled through the night with a few attendants; but in the\r\ndaytime, picking up as he went along the Persians and Grecian\r\nmercenaries who had come safely out of the battle, he had in all 4,000\r\nmen under his command. He then made a forced march towards the city\r\nof Thapsacus[273] and the river Euphrates,[274] in order to put that\r\nriver as soon as possible between himself and Alexander. But Amyntas\r\nson of Antiochus, Thymondas son of Mentor, Aristomedes the Pheraean,\r\nand Bianor the Acarnanian, all being deserters, fled without delay\r\nfrom the posts assigned them in the battle, with about 8,000 soldiers\r\nunder their command, and passing through the mountains, they arrived\r\nat Tripolis in Phoenicia.[275] There they seized the ships which had\r\nbeen hauled up on shore in which they had previously been transported\r\nfrom Lesbos; they launched as many of these vessel as they thought\r\nsufficient to convey them, and the rest they burnt there in the docks,\r\nin order not to supply their enemy with the means of quickly pursuing\r\nthem. They fled first to Cyprus,[276] thence to Egypt; where Amyntas\r\nshortly after, meddling in political disputes, was killed by the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nMeantime Pharnabazus and Autophradates were staying near Chios; then\r\nhaving established a garrison in this island they despatched some\r\nof their ships to Cos and Halicarnassus, and with 100 of their best\r\nsailing vessels they put to sea themselves and landed at Siphnus. And\r\nAgis, king of the Lacedaemonians,[277] came to them with one trireme,\r\nboth to ask for money to carry on the war, and also to urge them\r\nto send with him into the Peloponnese as large a force both naval\r\nand military as they could. At that very time news reached them of\r\nthe battle which had been fought at Issus; and being alarmed at the\r\nreport, Pharnabazus started off to Chios with twelve triremes and 1,500\r\nGrecian mercenaries, for fear that the Chians might attempt to effect\r\na revolution when they received the news of the Persian defeat. Agis,\r\nhaving received from Autophradates thirty talents of silver[278] and\r\nten triremes, despatched Hippias to lead these ships to his brother\r\nAgesilaus at Taenarum,[279] ordering him also to instruct Agesilaus to\r\ngive full pay to the sailors and then to sail as quickly as possible\r\nto Crete,[280] in order to set things in order there. For a time\r\nhe himself remained there among the islands, but afterwards joined\r\nAutophradates at Halicarnassus.[281]\r\n\r\nAlexander appointed Menon, son of Cerdimmas, viceroy of\r\nCoele-Syria,[282] giving him the cavalry of the Grecian allies to\r\nguard the country. He then went in person towards Phoenicia; and on the\r\nmarch he was met by Strato, son of Gerostratus, king of the Aradians\r\nand of the people living near Aradus.[283] But Gerostratus himself\r\nwas serving in the fleet with Autophradates, as were also the other\r\nkings both of the Phoenicians and the Cyprians. When Strato fell in\r\nwith Alexander, he placed a golden crown upon his head, promising to\r\nsurrender to him both the island of Aradus and the great and prosperous\r\ncity of Marathus, situated on the mainland right opposite Aradus; also\r\nSigon, the city of Mariamme, and all the other places under his own\r\ndominion and that of his father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nDARIUS’S LETTER, AND ALEXANDER’S REPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Alexander was still in Marathus, ambassadors came bringing a\r\nletter from Darius, entreating him to give up to their king his mother,\r\nwife, and children. They were also instructed to support this petition\r\nby word of mouth. The letter pointed out to him that friendship and\r\nalliance had subsisted between Philip and Artaxerxes;[284] and that\r\nwhen Arses, son of Artaxerxes, ascended the throne, Philip was the\r\nfirst to practise injustice towards him, though he had suffered no\r\ninjury from the Persians. Alexander also, from the time when Darius\r\nbegan to reign over the Persians, had not sent any one to him to\r\nconfirm the friendship and alliance which had so long existed, but had\r\ncrossed over into Asia with his army and had inflicted much injury upon\r\nthe Persians. For this reason he had come down in person, to defend his\r\ncountry and to preserve the empire of his fathers. As to the battle, it\r\nhad been decided as seemed good to some one of the gods. And now he, a\r\nking, begged his captured wife, mother, and children from a king; and\r\nhe wished to form a friendship with him and become his ally. For this\r\npurpose he requested Alexander to send men to him with Meniscus and\r\nArsimas, the messengers who came from the Persians, to receive pledges\r\nof fidelity from him and to give them on behalf of Alexander.\r\n\r\nTo this Alexander wrote a reply, and sent Thersippus with the men who\r\nhad come from Darius, with instructions to give the letter to Darius,\r\nbut not to converse about anything. Alexander’s letter ran thus: “Your\r\nancestors came into Macedonia and the rest of Greece and treated us\r\nill, without any previous injury from us. I, having been appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Greeks, and wishing to take revenge on the\r\nPersians, crossed over into Asia, hostilities being begun by you. For\r\nyou sent aid to the Perinthians,[285] who were dealing unjustly with my\r\nfather; and Ochus sent forces into Thrace, which was under our rule.\r\nMy father was killed by conspirators whom you instigated, as you\r\nhave yourself boasted to all in your letters;[286] and after slaying\r\nArses, as well as Bagoas, and unjustly seizing the throne contrary to\r\nthe law of the Persians,[287] and ruling your subjects unjustly, you\r\nsent unfriendly letters about me to the Greeks, urging them to wage\r\nwar with me. You have also despatched money to the Lacedaemonians, and\r\ncertain other Greeks; but none of the States received it, except the\r\nLacedaemonians.[288] As your agents destroyed my friends, and were\r\nstriving to dissolve the league which I had formed among the Greeks, I\r\ntook the field against you, because you were the party who commenced\r\nthe hostility. Since I have vanquished your generals and viceroys in\r\nthe previous battle, and now yourself and your forces in like manner, I\r\nam, by the gift of the gods, in possession of your land. As many of the\r\nmen who fought in your army as were not killed in the battle, but fled\r\nto me for refuge, I am protecting; and they are with me, not against\r\ntheir own will, but they are serving in my army as volunteers. Come to\r\nme therefore, since I am lord of all Asia; but if you are afraid you\r\nmay suffer any harsh treatment from me in case you come to me, send\r\nsome of your friends to receive pledges of safety from me. Come to me\r\nthen, and ask for your mother, wife, and children, and anything else\r\nyou wish. For whatever you ask for you will receive; and nothing shall\r\nbe denied you. But for the future, whenever you send to me, send to\r\nme as the king of Asia, and do not address to me your wishes as to an\r\nequal; but if you are in need of anything, speak to me as to the man\r\nwho is lord of all your territories. If you act otherwise, I shall\r\ndeliberate concerning you as an evil-doer; and if you dispute my right\r\nto the kingdom, stay and fight another battle for it; but do not run\r\naway. For wherever you may be, I intend to march against you.” This is\r\nthe letter which he sent to Darius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S TREATMENT OF THE CAPTURED GREEK AMBASSADORS.—SUBMISSION OF\r\nBYBLUS AND SIDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander ascertained that all the money which Darius had sent\r\noff to Damascus with Cophen, son of Artabazus, was captured, and also\r\nthat the Persians who had been left in charge of it, as well as the\r\nrest of the royal property, were taken prisoners, he ordered Parmenio\r\nto take the treasure back to Damascus, and there guard it.[289] When he\r\nalso ascertained that the Grecian ambassadors who had reached Darius\r\nbefore the battle had likewise been captured, he ordered them to be\r\nsent to him.[290] They were Euthycles, a Spartan; Thessaliscus, son\r\nof Ismenias, and Dionysodorus, a victor in the Olympic games, Thebans;\r\nand Iphicrates, son of Iphicrates the general, an Athenian.[291] When\r\nthese men came to Alexander, he immediately released Thessaliscus and\r\nDionysodorus, though they were Thebans, partly out of compassion for\r\nThebes, and partly because they seemed to have acted in a pardonable\r\nmanner. For their native city had been reduced to slavery by the\r\nMacedonians, and they were trying to find whatever succour they could\r\nfor themselves and perhaps also for their native city from Darius\r\nand the Persians. Thinking thus compassionately about both of them,\r\nhe released them, saying that he dismissed Thessaliscus individually\r\nout of respect for his pedigree, for he belonged to the ranks of the\r\ndistinguished men of Thebes. Dionysodorus also he released because he\r\nhad been conqueror at the Olympic games; and he kept Iphicrates in\r\nattendance on himself as long as he lived, treating him with special\r\nhonour both from friendship to the city of Athens and from recollection\r\nof his father’s glory. When he died soon after from sickness, he sent\r\nhis bones back to his relations at Athens. But Euthycles at first\r\nhe kept in custody, though without fetters, both because he was a\r\nLacedaemonian of a city at that time openly and eminently hostile to\r\nhim, and because in the man as an individual he could find nothing to\r\nwarrant his pardon. Afterwards, when he met with great success, he\r\nreleased even this man also.\r\n\r\nHe set out from Marathus and took possession of Byblus[292] on terms of\r\ncapitulation, as he did also of Sidon,[293] the inhabitants of which\r\nspontaneously invited him from hatred of the Persians and Darius.[294]\r\nThence he advanced towards Tyre;[295] ambassadors from which city,\r\ndespatched by the commonwealth, met him on the march, announcing\r\nthat the Tyrians had decided to do whatever he might command.[296] He\r\ncommended both the city and its ambassadors, and ordered them to return\r\nand tell the Tyrians that he wished to enter their city and offer\r\nsacrifice to Heracles. The son of the king of the Tyrians was one of\r\nthe ambassadors, and the others were conspicuous men in Tyre; but the\r\nking Azemilcus[297] himself was sailing with Autophradates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE WORSHIP OF HERCULES IN TYRE.—THE TYRIANS REFUSE TO ADMIT ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason of this demand was, that in Tyre there existed a temple\r\nof Heracles,[298] the most ancient of all those which are mentioned\r\nin history. It was not dedicated to the Argive Heracles, the son of\r\nAlcmena; for this Heracles was honoured in Tyre many generations\r\nbefore Cadmus set out from Phoenicia and occupied Thebes, and before\r\nSemele, the daughter of Cadmus, was born, from whom Dionysus, the son\r\nof Zeus, was born. This Dionysus would be third from Cadmus, being a\r\ncontemporary of Labdacus, son of Polydorus, the son of Cadmus; and the\r\nArgive Heracles lived about the time of Oedipus, son of Laius.[299] The\r\nEgyptians also worshipped another Heracles, not the one which either\r\nthe Tyrians or Greeks worship. But Herodotus says that the Egyptians\r\nconsidered Heracles to be one of the twelve gods,[300] just as the\r\nAthenians worshipped a different Dionysus, who was the son of Zeus and\r\nCore; and the mystic chant called Iacchus was sung to this Dionysus,\r\nnot to the ligaturee Theban. So also I think that the Heracles honoured\r\nin Tartessus[301] by the Iberians, where are certain pillars named\r\nafter Heracles, is the Tyrian Heracles; for Tartessus was a colony of\r\nthe Phœnicians, and the temple to Heracles there was built and the\r\nsacrifices offered after the usage of the Phœnicians. Hecataeus the\r\nhistorian[302] says Geryones, against whom the Argive Heracles was\r\ndespatched by Eurystheus to drive his oxen away and bring them to\r\nMycenae, had nothing to do with the land of the Iberians;[303] nor\r\nwas Heracles despatched to any island called Erythia[304] outside\r\nthe Great Sea; but that Geryones was king of the mainland (Epirus)\r\naround Ambracia[305] and the Amphilochians, that Heracles drove the\r\noxen from this Epirus, and that this was deemed no mean task. I know\r\nthat to the present time this part of the mainland is rich in pasture\r\nland and rears a very fine breed of oxen; and I do not think it beyond\r\nthe bounds of probability that the fame of the oxen from Epirus, and\r\nthe name of the king of Epirus, Geryones, had reached Eurystheus. But\r\nI do not think that Eurystheus would know the name of the king of the\r\nIberians, who were the remotest nation in Europe, or whether a fine\r\nbreed of oxen grazed in their land, unless some one, by introducing\r\nHera into the account, as herself giving these commands to Heracles\r\nthrough Eurystheus, wished, by means of the fable, to disguise the\r\nincredibility of the tale.\r\n\r\nTo this Tyrian Heracles, Alexander said he wished to offer sacrifice.\r\nBut when this message was brought to Tyre by the ambassadors, the\r\npeople passed a decree to obey any other command of Alexander, but not\r\nto admit into the city any Persian or Macedonian; thinking that under\r\nthe existing circumstances, this was the most specious answer, and that\r\nit would be the safest course for them to pursue in reference to the\r\nissue of the war, which was still uncertain.[306] When the answer from\r\nTyre was brought to Alexander, he sent the ambassadors back in a rage.\r\nHe then summoned a council of his Companions and the leaders of his\r\narmy, together with the captains of infantry and cavalry, and spoke as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF ALEXANDER TO HIS OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Friends and allies, I see that an expedition to Egypt will not be safe\r\nfor us, so long as the Persians retain the sovereignty of the sea; nor\r\nis it a safe course, both for other reasons, and especially looking at\r\nthe state of matters in Greece, for us to pursue Darius, leaving in\r\nour rear the city of Tyre itself in doubtful allegiance, and Egypt and\r\nCyprus in the occupation of the Persians. I am apprehensive lest while\r\nwe advance with our forces towards Babylon and in pursuit of Darius,\r\nthe Persians should again forsooth conquer the maritime districts, and\r\ntransfer the war into Greece with a larger army, considering that the\r\nLacedaemonians are now waging war against us without disguise, and\r\nthe city of Athens is restrained for the present rather by fear than\r\nby any good-will towards us. But if Tyre were captured, the whole of\r\nPhoenicia would be in our possession, and the fleet of the Phoenicians,\r\nwhich is the most numerous and the best in the Persian navy, would in\r\nall probability come over to us. For the Phoenician sailors and marines\r\nwill not put to sea in order to incur danger on behalf of others, when\r\ntheir own cities are occupied by us. After this, Cyprus will either\r\nyield to us without delay, or will be captured with ease at the mere\r\narrival of a naval force; and then navigating the sea with the ships\r\nfrom Macedonia in conjunction with those of the Phoenicians, Cyprus\r\nat the same time coming over to us, we shall acquire the absolute\r\nsovereignty of the sea, and at the same time an expedition into Egypt\r\nwill become an easy matter for us. After we have brought Egypt into\r\nsubjection, no anxiety about Greece and our own land will any longer\r\nremain, and we shall be able to undertake the expedition to Babylon\r\nwith safety in regard to affairs at home, and at the same time with\r\ngreater reputation, in consequence of having cut off from the Persian\r\nempire all the maritime provinces and all the land this side of the\r\nEuphrates.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF TYRE.—CONSTRUCTION OF A MOLE FROM THE MAINLAND TO THE ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this speech he easily persuaded his officers to make an attempt\r\nupon Tyre. Moreover he was encouraged by a divine admonition, for\r\nthat very night in his sleep[307] he seemed to be approaching the\r\nTyrian walls, and Heracles seemed to take him by the right hand and\r\nlead him up into the city. This was interpreted by Aristander[308]\r\nto mean that Tyre would be taken with labour, because the deeds of\r\nHeracles were accomplished with labour. Certainly, the siege of Tyre\r\nappeared to be a great enterprise; for the city was an island[309] and\r\nfortified all round with lofty walls. Moreover naval operations seemed\r\nat that time more favourable to the Tyrians, both because the Persians\r\nstill possessed the sovereignty of the sea and many ships were still\r\nremaining with the citizens themselves. However, as these arguments of\r\nhis had prevailed, he resolved to construct a mole from the mainland\r\nto the city.[310] The place is a narrow strait full of pools; and the\r\npart of it near the mainland is shallow water and muddy, but the part\r\nnear the city itself, where was the deepest part of the channel, was\r\nthe depth of about three fathoms. But there was an abundant supply of\r\nstones and wood, which they put on the top of the stones.[311] Stakes\r\nwere easily fixed down firmly in the mud, which itself served as a\r\ncement to the stones to hold them firm. The zeal of the Macedonians in\r\nthe work was great, and it was increased by the presence of Alexander\r\nhimself, who took the lead[312] in everything, now rousing the men to\r\nexertion by speech, and now by presents of money, lightening the labour\r\nof those who were toiling more than their fellows from the desire of\r\ngaining praise for their exertions. As long as the mole was being\r\nconstructed near the mainland, the work made easy and rapid progress,\r\nas the material was poured into a small depth of water, and there was\r\nno one to hinder them; but when they began to approach the deeper\r\nwater, and at the same time came near the city itself, they suffered\r\nseverely, being assailed with missiles from the walls, which were\r\nlofty, inasmuch as they had been expressly equipped for work rather\r\nthan for fighting. Moreover, as the Tyrians still retained command of\r\nthe sea, they kept on sailing with their triremes to various parts of\r\nthe mole, and made it impossible in many places for the Macedonians\r\nto pour in the material. But the latter erected two towers upon the\r\nmole, which they had now projected over a long stretch of sea, and\r\nupon these towers they placed engines of war. Skins and prepared hides\r\nserved as coverings in front of them, to prevent them being struck\r\nby fire-bearing missiles from the wall, and at the same time to be\r\na screen against arrows to those who were working. It was likewise\r\nintended that the Tyrians who might sail near to injure the men engaged\r\nin the construction of the mole should not retire easily, being\r\nassailed by missiles from the towers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF TYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to counteract this the Tyrians adopted the following contrivance.\r\nThey filled a vessel, which had been used for transporting horses, with\r\ndry twigs and other combustible wood, fixed two masts on the prow,\r\nand fenced it round in the form of a circle as large as possible, so\r\nthat the enclosure might contain as much chaff and as many torches\r\nas possible. Moreover they placed upon this vessel quantities of\r\npitch, brimstone, and whatever else was calculated to foment a great\r\nflame.[313] They also stretched out a double yard-arm upon each mast;\r\nand from these they hung caldrons into which they had poured or\r\ncast materials likely to kindle flame which would extend to a great\r\ndistance. They then put ballast into the stern, in order to raise the\r\nprow aloft, the vessel being weighed down abaft.[314] Then watching\r\nfor a wind bearing towards the mole, they fastened the vessel to some\r\ntriremes which towed it before the breeze. As soon as they approached\r\nthe mole and the towers, they threw fire among the wood, and at the\r\nsame time ran the vessel, with the triremes, aground as violently as\r\npossible, dashing against the end of the mole. The men in the vessel\r\neasily swam away, as soon as it was set on fire. A great flame soon\r\ncaught the towers; and the yard-arms being twisted round poured out\r\ninto the fire the materials that had been prepared for kindling the\r\nflame. The men also in the triremes tarrying near the mole kept on\r\nshooting arrows into the towers, so that it was not safe for men to\r\napproach in order to bring materials to quench the fire. Upon this,\r\nwhen the towers had already caught fire, many men hastened from the\r\ncity, and embarking in light vessels, and striking against various\r\nparts of the mole, easily tore down the stockade which had been placed\r\nin front of it for protection, and burnt up all the engines of war\r\nwhich the fire from the vessel did not reach.[315] But Alexander began\r\nto construct a wider mole from the mainland, capable of containing more\r\ntowers; and he ordered the engine-makers to prepare fresh engines.\r\nWhile this was being performed, he took the shield-bearing guards and\r\nthe Agrianians and set out to Sidon, to collect there all the triremes\r\nhe could; since it was evident that the successful conclusion of the\r\nsiege would be much more difficult to attain, so long as the Tyrians\r\nretained the superiority at sea.[316]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTYRE BESIEGED BY SEA AS WELL AS LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time Gerostratus, King of Aradus, and Enylus, King of\r\nByblus, ascertaining that their cities were in the possession of\r\nAlexander, deserted Autophradates and the fleet under his command, and\r\ncame to Alexander with their naval force, accompanied by the Sidonian\r\ntriremes; so that about eighty Phoenician ships joined him. About the\r\nsame time triremes also came to him from Rhodes, both the one called\r\n_Peripolus_,[317] and with it nine others. From Soli and Mallus also\r\ncame three, and from Lycia ten; from Macedonia also a ship with fifty\r\noars, in which sailed Proteas, son of Andronicus.[318] Not long after,\r\ntoo, the kings of Cyprus put into Sidon with about one hundred and\r\ntwenty ships, when they heard of the defeat of Darius at Issus, and\r\nwere terrified, because the whole of Phoenicia was already in the\r\npossession of Alexander. To all of these Alexander granted indemnity\r\nfor their previous conduct, because they seemed to have joined the\r\nPersian fleet rather by necessity than by their own choice. While the\r\nengines of war were being constructed for him, and the ships were\r\nbeing fitted up for a naval attack on the city and for the trial of\r\na sea-battle, he took some squadrons of cavalry, the Agrianians and\r\narchers, and made an expedition into the range of mountains called\r\nAnti-Libănus.[319] Having subdued some of the mountaineers by force,\r\nand drawn others over to him by terms of capitulation, he returned to\r\nSidon in ten days.[320] Here he found Oleander, son of Polemocrates,\r\njust arrived from Peloponnesus, having 4,000 Grecian mercenaries with\r\nhim.[321]\r\n\r\nWhen his fleet had been arranged in due order, he embarked upon the\r\ndecks as many of his shield-bearing guards as seemed sufficient for his\r\nenterprise, unless a sea-battle were to be fought rather by breaking\r\nthe enemy’s line[322] than by a close conflict. He then started from\r\nSidon and sailed towards Tyre with his ships arranged in proper order,\r\nhimself being on the right wing which stretched out seaward; and with\r\nhim were the kings of the Cyprians, and all those of the Phoenicians\r\nexcept Pnytagoras, who with Craterus was commanding the left wing\r\nof the whole line. The Tyrians had previously resolved to fight a\r\nsea-battle, if Alexander should sail against them by sea. But then\r\nwith surprise they beheld the vast multitude of his ships; for they\r\nhad not yet learnt that Alexander had all the ships of the Cyprians\r\nand Phoenicians. At the same time they were surprised to see that he\r\nwas sailing against them with his fleet arranged in due order; for\r\nAlexander’s fleet a little before it came near the city, tarried for a\r\nwhile out in the open sea, with the view of provoking the Tyrians to\r\ncome out to a battle; but afterwards, as the enemy did not put out to\r\nsea against them, though they were thus arranged in line, they advanced\r\nto the attack with a great dashing of oars. Seeing this, the Tyrians\r\ndecided not to fight a battle at sea, but closely blocked up the\r\npassage for ships with as many triremes as the mouths of their harbour\r\nwould contain, and guarded it, so that the enemy’s fleet might not find\r\nan anchorage in any of the harbours.\r\n\r\nAs the Tyrians did not put out to sea against him, Alexander sailed\r\nnear the city, but resolved not to try to force an entrance into the\r\nharbour towards Sidon on account of the narrowness of its mouth; and\r\nat the same time because he saw that the entrance had been blocked\r\nup with many triremes having their prows turned towards him. But the\r\nPhoenicians fell upon the three triremes moored furthest out at the\r\nmouth of the harbour, and attacking them prow to prow, succeeded in\r\nsinking them. However, the men in the ships easily swam off to the\r\nland which was friendly to them. Then, indeed, Alexander moored his\r\nships along the shore not far from the mole which had been made, where\r\nthere appeared to be shelter from the winds; and on the following day\r\nhe ordered the Cyprians with their ships and their admiral Andromachus\r\nto moor near the city opposite the harbour which faces towards Sidon,\r\nand the Phoenicians opposite the harbour which looks towards Egypt,\r\nsituated on the other side of the mole, where also was his own tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF TYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had now collected many engineers both from Cyprus and the whole of\r\nPhoenicia, and many engines of war had been constructed,[323] some\r\nupon the mole, others upon vessels used for transporting horses, which\r\nhe brought with him from Sidon, and others upon the triremes which\r\nwere not fast sailers. When all the preparations had been completed\r\nthey brought up the engines of war along the mole that had been made\r\nand also began to shoot from ships moored near various parts of the\r\nwall and making trial of its strength. The Tyrians erected wooden\r\ntowers on their battlements opposite the mole, from which they might\r\nannoy the enemy; and if the engines of war were brought near any other\r\npart, they defended themselves with missiles and shot at the very\r\nships with fire-bearing arrows, so that they deterred the Macedonians\r\nfrom approaching the wall. Their walls opposite the mole were about\r\none hundred and fifty feet high, with a breadth in proportion, and\r\nconstructed with large stones imbedded in gypsum. It was not easy\r\nfor the horse-transports and the triremes of the Macedonians, which\r\nwere conveying the engines of war up to the wall, to approach the\r\ncity, because a great quantity of stones hurled forward into the sea\r\nprevented their near assault. These stones Alexander determined to drag\r\nout of the sea; but this was a work accomplished with great difficulty,\r\nsince it was performed from ships and not from the firm earth;\r\nespecially as the Tyrians, covering their ships with mail, brought them\r\nalongside the anchors of the triremes, and cutting the cables of the\r\nanchors underneath, made anchoring impossible for the enemy’s ships.\r\nBut Alexander covered many thirty-oared vessels with mail in the same\r\nway, and placed them athwart in front of the anchors, so that the\r\nassault of the ships was repelled by them. But, notwithstanding this,\r\ndivers under the sea secretly cut their cables. The Macedonians then\r\nused chains to their anchors instead of cables, and let them down so\r\nthat the divers could do no more harm. Then, fastening slip-knots to\r\nthe stones, they dragged them out of the sea from the mole; and having\r\nraised them aloft with cranes, they discharged them into deep water,\r\nwhere they were no longer likely to do injury by being hurled forward.\r\nThe ships now easily approached the part of the wall where it had been\r\nmade clear of the stones which had been hurled forward. The Tyrians\r\nbeing now reduced to great straits on all sides, resolved to make an\r\nattack on the Cyprian ships, which were moored opposite the harbour\r\nturned towards Sidon. For a long time they spread sails across the\r\nmouth of the harbour, in order that the filling of the triremes might\r\nnot be discernible; and about the middle of the day, when the sailors\r\nwere scattered in quest of necessaries, and when Alexander usually\r\nretired from the fleet to his tent on the other side of the city, they\r\nfilled three quinqueremes, an equal number of quadriremes and seven\r\ntriremes with the most expert complement of rowers possible, and with\r\nthe best-armed men adapted for fighting from the decks, together with\r\nthe men most daring in naval contests. At first they rowed out slowly\r\nand quietly in single file, moving forward the handles of their oars\r\nwithout any signal from the men who give the time to the rowers[324];\r\nbut when they were already tacking against the Cyprians, and were near\r\nenough to be seen, then indeed with a loud shout and encouragement to\r\neach other, and at the same time with impetuous rowing, they commenced\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF TYRE.—NAVAL DEFEAT OF THE TYRIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened on that day that Alexander went away to his tent, but\r\nafter a short time returned to his ships, not tarrying according to\r\nhis usual custom. The Tyrians fell all of a sudden upon the ships\r\nlying at their moorings, finding some entirely empty and others being\r\nfilled with difficulty from the men who happened to be present at\r\nthe very time of the noise and attack. At the first onset they at\r\nonce sank the quinquereme of the king Pnytagoras, that of Androcles\r\nthe Amathusian[325] and that of Pasicrates the Curian;[326] and they\r\nshattered the other ships by pushing them ashore. But when Alexander\r\nperceived the sailing out of the Tyrian triremes, he ordered most of\r\nthe ships under his command to be manned and to take position at the\r\nmouth of the harbour, so that the rest of the Tyrian ships might not\r\nsail out. He then took the quinqueremes which he had and about five\r\nof the triremes, which were manned by him in haste before the rest\r\nwere ready, and sailed round the city against the Tyrians who had\r\nsailed out of the harbour. The men on the wall, perceiving the enemy’s\r\nattack and observing that Alexander himself was in the fleet, began\r\nto shout to those in their own ships, urging them to return; but as\r\ntheir shouts were not audible, on account of the noise of those who\r\nwere engaged in the action, they exhorted them to retreat by various\r\nkinds of signals. At last after a long time, perceiving the impending\r\nattack of Alexander’s fleet, they tacked about and began to flee into\r\nthe harbour; and a few of their ships succeeded in escaping, but\r\nAlexander’s vessels assaulted the greater number, and rendered some\r\nof them unfit for sailing; and a quinquereme and a quadrireme were\r\ncaptured at the very mouth of the harbour. But the slaughter of the\r\nmarines was not great; for when they perceived that their ships were\r\nin possession of the enemy, they swam off without difficulty into the\r\nharbour. As the Tyrians could no longer derive any aid from their\r\nships, the Macedonians now brought up their military engines to the\r\nwall itself. Those which were brought near the city along the mole,\r\ndid no damage worth mentioning on account of the strength of the wall\r\nthere. Others brought up some of the ships conveying military engines\r\nopposite the part of the city turned towards Sidon. But when even there\r\nthey met with no success, Alexander passed round to the wall projecting\r\ntowards the south wind and towards Egypt, and tested the strength\r\nof the works everywhere. Here first a large piece of the wall was\r\nthoroughly shaken, and a part of it was even broken and thrown down.\r\nThen indeed for a short time he tried to make an assault to the extent\r\nof throwing a bridge upon the part of the wall where a breach had been\r\nmade. But the Tyrians without much difficulty beat the Macedonians back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF TYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third day after this, having waited for a calm sea, after\r\nencouraging the leaders of the regiments for the action, he led the\r\nships containing the military engines up to the city. In the first\r\nplace he shook down a large piece of the wall; and when the breach\r\nappeared to be sufficiently wide, he ordered the vessels conveying the\r\nmilitary engines to retire, and brought up two others, which carried\r\nhis bridges, which he intended to throw upon the breach in the wall.\r\nThe shield-bearing guards occupied one of these vessels, which he had\r\nput under the command of Admetus; and the other was occupied by the\r\nregiment of Coenus, called the foot Companions. Alexander himself, with\r\nthe shield-bearing guards, intended to scale the wall where it might be\r\npracticable. He ordered some of his triremes to sail against both of\r\nthe harbours, to see if by any means they could force an entrance when\r\nthe Tyrians had turned themselves to oppose him. He also ordered those\r\nof his triremes which contained the missiles to be hurled from engines,\r\nor which were carrying archers upon deck, to sail right round the wall\r\nand to put in where it was practicable, and to take up position within\r\nshooting range, until it became impossible to put in, so that the\r\nTyrians, being shot at from all quarters, might become distracted, and\r\nnot know whither to turn in their distress. When Alexander’s ships drew\r\nclose to the city and the bridges were thrown from them upon the wall,\r\nthe shield-bearing guards mounted valiantly along these upon the wall;\r\nfor their captain, Admetus, proved himself brave on that occasion,\r\nand Alexander accompanied them, both as a courageous participant in\r\nthe action itself, and as a witness of brilliant and dangerous feats\r\nof valour performed by others. The first part of the wall that was\r\ncaptured was where Alexander had posted himself; the Tyrians being\r\neasily beaten back from it, as soon as the Macedonians found firm\r\nfooting, and at the same time a way of entrance not abrupt on every\r\nside. Admetus was the first to mount the wall; but while cheering on\r\nhis men to mount, he was struck with a spear and died on the spot.\r\n\r\nAfter him, Alexander with the Companions got possession of the\r\nwall[327]; and when some of the towers and the parts of the wall\r\nbetween them were in his hands, he advanced through the battlements to\r\nthe royal palace, because the descent into the city that way seemed the\r\neasiest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF TYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return to the fleet, the Phoenicians posted opposite the harbour\r\nlooking towards Egypt, facing which they happened to be moored, forcing\r\ntheir way and bursting the bars asunder, shattered the ships in the\r\nharbour, attacking some of them in deep water and driving others\r\nashore. The Cyprians also sailed into the other harbour looking towards\r\nSidon, which had no bar across it, and made a speedy capture of the\r\ncity on that side. The main body of the Tyrians deserted the wall when\r\nthey saw it in the enemy’s possession; and rallying opposite what was\r\ncalled the chapel of Agenor,[328] they there turned round to resist the\r\nMacedonians. Against these Alexander advanced with his shield-bearing\r\nguards, destroyed the men who fought there, and pursued those who fled.\r\nGreat was the slaughter also made both by those who were now occupying\r\nthe city from the harbour and by the regiment of Coenus, which had also\r\nentered it. For the Macedonians were now for the most part advancing\r\nfull of rage, being angry both at the length of the siege and also\r\nbecause the Tyrians, having captured some of their men sailing from\r\nSidon, had conveyed them to the top of their wall, so that the deed\r\nmight be visible from the camp, and after slaughtering them, had cast\r\ntheir bodies into the sea. About 8,000 of the Tyrians were killed; and\r\nof the Macedonians, besides Admetus, who had proved himself a valiant\r\nman, being the first to scale the wall, twenty of the shield-bearing\r\nguards were killed in the assault on that occasion. In the whole siege\r\nabout 400 Macedonians were slain. Alexander gave an amnesty to all\r\nthose who fled for refuge into the temple of Heracles; among them\r\nbeing most of the Tyrian magistrates, including the king Azemilcus, as\r\nwell as certain envoys from the Carthaginians, who had come to their\r\nmother-city to attend the sacrifice in honour of Heracles, according\r\nto an ancient custom.[329] The rest of the prisoners were reduced\r\nto slavery; all the Tyrians and mercenary troops, to the number of\r\nabout 30,000, who had been captured, being sold.[330] Alexander then\r\noffered sacrifice to Heracles, and conducted a procession in honour\r\nof that deity with all his soldiers fully armed. The ships also took\r\npart in this religious procession in honour of Heracles. He moreover\r\nheld a gymnastic contest in the temple, and celebrated a torch race.\r\nThe military engine, also, with which the wall had been battered down,\r\nwas brought into the temple and dedicated as a thank-offering; and the\r\nTyrian ship sacred to Heracles, which had been captured in the naval\r\nattack, was likewise dedicated to the god. An inscription was placed\r\non it, either composed by Alexander himself or by some one else; but\r\nas it is not worthy of recollection, I have not deemed it worth while\r\nto describe it. Thus then was Tyre captured in the month Hecatombaion,\r\nwhen Anicetus was archon at Athens.[331]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE OFFERS OF DARIUS REJECTED.—BATIS, GOVERNOR OF GAZA, REFUSES TO\r\nSUBMIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Alexander was still occupied by the siege of Tyre, ambassadors\r\ncame to him from Darius, announcing that he would give him ten thousand\r\ntalents[332] in exchange for his mother, wife, and children; that all\r\nthe territory west of the river Euphrates, as far as the Grecian Sea,\r\nshould be Alexander’s; and proposing that he should marry the daughter\r\nof Darius, and become his friend and ally.[333] When these proposals\r\nwere announced in a conference of the Companions, Parmenio is said to\r\nhave told Alexander, that if he were Alexander he should be delighted\r\nto put an end to the war on these terms, and incur no further hazard of\r\nsuccess. Alexander is said to have replied, So would he also do, if he\r\nwere Parmenio, but as he was Alexander he replied to Darius as he did.\r\nFor he said that he was neither in want of money from Darius, nor would\r\nhe receive a part of his territory instead of the whole; for that all\r\nhis money and territory were his; and that if he wished to marry the\r\ndaughter of Darius, he would marry her, even though Darius refused her\r\nto him. He commanded Darius to come to him if he wished to experience\r\nany generous treatment from him. When Darius heard this answer, he\r\ndespaired of coming to terms with Alexander, and began to make fresh\r\npreparations for war.\r\n\r\nAlexander now resolved to make an expedition into Egypt. All the other\r\nparts of what was called Palestine Syria[334] had already yielded to\r\nhim; but a certain eunuch, named Batis, who was in possession of the\r\ncity of Gaza, paid no heed to him; but procuring Arabian mercenaries,\r\nand having been long employed in laying up sufficient food for a long\r\nsiege, he resolved not to admit Alexander into the city, feeling\r\nconfident that the place could never be taken by storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF GAZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nGaza is about twenty stades from the sea;[335] the approach to it\r\nis sandy and over heavy soil, and the sea near the city everywhere\r\nshallow. The city of Gaza[336] was large, and had been built upon a\r\nlofty mound, around which a strong wall had been carried. It is the\r\nlast city the traveller meets with going from Phoenicia to Egypt,\r\nbeing situated on the edge of the desert. When Alexander arrived near\r\nthe city, on the first day he encamped at the spot where the wall\r\nseemed to him most easy to assail, and ordered his military engines to\r\nbe constructed. But the engineers expressed the opinion that it was\r\nnot possible to capture the wall by force, on account of the height\r\nof the mound. However, the more impracticable it seemed to be, the\r\nmore resolutely Alexander determined that it must be captured. For he\r\nsaid that the action would strike the enemy with great alarm from its\r\nbeing contrary to their expectation; whereas his failure to capture\r\nthe place would redound to his disgrace when mentioned either to the\r\nGreeks or to Darius. He therefore resolved to construct a mound right\r\nround the city, so as to be able to bring his military engines up to\r\nthe walls from the artificial mound which had been raised to the same\r\nlevel with them. The mound was constructed especially over against\r\nthe southern wall of the city, where it appeared easiest to make an\r\nassault. When he thought that the mound had been raised to the proper\r\nlevel with the walls, the Macedonians placed their military engines\r\nupon it, and brought them close to the wall of Gaza. At this time while\r\nAlexander was offering sacrifice, and, crowned with a garland, was\r\nabout to commence the first sacred rite according to custom, a certain\r\ncarnivorous bird, flying over the altar, let a stone which it was\r\ncarrying with its claws fall upon his head. Alexander asked Aristander,\r\nthe soothsayer,[337] what this omen meant. He replied: “O king, thou\r\nwilt indeed capture the city, but thou must take care of thyself on\r\nthis day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF GAZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander heard this, he kept himself for a time near the military\r\nengines, out of the reach of missiles. But when a vigorous sortie was\r\nmade from the city, and the Arabs were carrying torches to set fire\r\nto the military engines, and from their commanding position above\r\nhurling missiles at the Macedonians, who were defending themselves\r\nfrom lower ground, were driving them down from the mound which they\r\nhad made, then Alexander either wilfully disobeyed the soothsayer, or\r\nforgot the prophecy from excitement in the heat of action. Taking the\r\nshield-bearing guards, he hastened to the rescue where the Macedonians\r\nwere especially hard pressed, and prevented them from being driven\r\ndown from the mound in disgraceful flight. But he was himself wounded\r\nby a bolt from a catapult, right through the shield and breastplate\r\ninto the shoulder. When he perceived that Aristander had spoken the\r\ntruth about the wound, he rejoiced, because he thought he should also\r\ncapture the city by the aid of the soothsayer. And yet indeed he was\r\nnot easily cured of the wound. In the meantime the military engines\r\nwith which he had captured Tyre arrived, having been sent for by sea;\r\nand he ordered the mound to be constructed quite round the city on all\r\nsides, two stades[338] in breadth and 250 feet in height. When his\r\nengines had been prepared, and brought up along the mound, they shook\r\ndown a large extent of wall; and mines being dug in various places,\r\nand the earth being drawn out by stealth, the wall fell down in many\r\nparts, subsiding into the emptied space.[339] The Macedonians then\r\ncommanded a large extent of ground with their missiles, driving back\r\nthe men who were defending the city, from the towers. Nevertheless, the\r\nmen of the city sustained three assaults, though many of their number\r\nwere killed or wounded; but at the fourth attack, Alexander led up the\r\nphalanx of the Macedonians from all sides, threw down the part of the\r\nwall which was undermined, and shook down another large portion of it\r\nby battering it with his engines, so that he rendered the assault an\r\neasy matter through the breaches with his scaling ladders. Accordingly\r\nthe ladders were brought up to the wall; and then there arose a great\r\nemulation among those of the Macedonians who laid any claim to valour,\r\nto see who should be the first to scale the wall. The first to do so\r\nwas Neoptolemus, one of the Companions, of the family of the Aeacidae;\r\nand after him mounted one rank after another with their officers. When\r\nonce some of the Macedonians got within the wall, they split open in\r\nsuccession the gates which each party happened to light upon, and thus\r\nadmitted the whole army into the city. But though their city was now\r\nin the hands of the enemy, the Gazaeans nevertheless stood together\r\nand fought; so that they were all slain fighting there, as each man had\r\nbeen stationed. Alexander sold their wives and children into slavery;\r\nand having peopled the city again from the neighbouring settlers, he\r\nmade use of it as a fortified post for the war.[340]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF EGYPT.—FOUNDATION OF ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander now led an expedition into Egypt, whither he had set out\r\nat first (from Tyre); and marching from Gaza, on the seventh day\r\nhe arrived at Pelusium[341] in Egypt. His fleet had also set sail\r\nfrom Phoenicia to Egypt; and he found the ships already moored at\r\nPelusium.[342] When Mazaces the Persian, whom Darius had appointed\r\nviceroy of Egypt,[343] ascertained how the battle at Issus had\r\nresulted, that Darius had fled in disgraceful flight, and that\r\nPhoenicia, Syria, and most of Arabia were already in Alexander’s\r\npossession, as he had no Persian force with which he could offer\r\nresistance, he admitted Alexander into the cities and the country in a\r\nfriendly way.[344] Alexander introduced a garrison into Pelusium, and\r\nordering the men in the ships to sail up the river as far as the city\r\nof Memphis,[345] he went in person towards Heliopolis,[346] having the\r\nriver Nile[347] on his right. He reached that city through the desert,\r\nafter getting possession of all the places on the march through the\r\nvoluntary surrender of the inhabitants. Thence he crossed the stream\r\nand came to Memphis; where he offered sacrifice to Apis[348] and the\r\nother gods, and celebrated a gymnastic and musical contest, the most\r\ndistinguished artists in these matters coming to him from Greece.\r\nFrom Memphis he sailed down the river towards the sea, embarking the\r\nshield-bearing guards, the archers, the Agrianians, and of the cavalry\r\nthe royal squadron of the Companions. Coming to Canobus,[349] he sailed\r\nround the Marian lake,[350] and disembarked where now is situated the\r\ncity of Alexandria, which takes its name from him. The position seemed\r\nto him a very fine one in which to found a city, and he foresaw that\r\nit would become a prosperous one.[351] Therefore he was seized by an\r\nardent desire to undertake the enterprise, and himself marked out the\r\nboundaries of the city, pointing out the place where the agora was to\r\nbe constructed, where the temples were to be built, stating how many\r\nthere were to be, and to what Grecian gods they were to be dedicated,\r\nand specially marking a spot for a temple to the Egyptian Isis.[352]\r\nHe also pointed out where the wall was to be carried round it. In\r\nregard to these matters he offered sacrifice, and the victims appeared\r\nfavourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION OF ALEXANDRIA.—EVENTS IN THE AEGEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following story is told, which seems to me not unworthy of\r\nbelief[353]:—that Alexander himself wished to leave behind for the\r\nbuilders the marks for the boundaries of the fortification, but that\r\nthere was nothing at hand with which to make a furrow in the ground.\r\nOne of the builders[354] hit upon the plan of collecting in vessels\r\nthe barley which the soldiers were carrying, and throwing it upon\r\nthe ground where the king led the way; and thus the circle of the\r\nfortification which he was making[355] for the city was completely\r\nmarked out. The soothsayers, and especially Aristander the Telmissian,\r\nwho was said already to have given many other true predictions,\r\npondering this, told Alexander that the city would become prosperous in\r\nevery respect, but especially in regard to the fruits of the earth.\r\n\r\nAt this time Hegelochus[356] sailed to Egypt and informed Alexander\r\nthat the Tenedians had revolted from the Persians and attached\r\nthemselves to him; because they had gone over to the Persians against\r\ntheir own wish. He also said that the democracy of Chios were\r\nintroducing Alexander’s adherents in spite of those who held the city,\r\nbeing established in it by Autophradates and Pharnabazus. The latter\r\ncommander had been caught there and kept as a prisoner, as was also the\r\ndespot Aristonicus, a Methymnaean,[357] who sailed into the harbour of\r\nChios with five piratical vessels, fitted with one and a half banks\r\nof oars, not knowing that the harbour was in the hands of Alexander’s\r\nadherents, but being misled by those who kept the bars of the harbour,\r\nbecause forsooth the fleet of Pharnabazus was moored in it. All the\r\npirates were there massacred by the Chians; and Hegelochus brought to\r\nAlexander, as prisoners Aristonicus, Apollonides the Chian, Phisinus,\r\nMegareus, and all the others who had taken part in the revolt of Chios\r\nto the Persians, and who at that time were holding the government of\r\nthe island by force. He also announced that he had deprived Chares[358]\r\nof the possession of Mitylene, that he had brought over the other\r\ncities in Lesbos by a voluntary agreement, and that he had sent\r\nAmphoterus to Cos with sixty ships, for the Coans themselves invited\r\nhim to their island. He said that he himself had sailed to Cos and\r\nfound it already in the hands of Amphoterus. Hegelochus brought all the\r\nprisoners with him except Pharnabazus, who had eluded his guards at\r\nCos and got away by stealth. Alexander sent the despots who had been\r\nbrought from the cities back to their fellow-citizens, to be treated as\r\nthey pleased; but Apollonides and his Chian partisans he sent under a\r\nstrict guard to Elephantinē, an Egyptian city.[359]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER VISITS THE TEMPLE OF AMMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter these transactions, Alexander was seized by an ardent desire\r\nto visit Ammon[360] in Libya, partly in order to consult the god,\r\nbecause the oracle of Ammon was said to be exact in its information,\r\nand Perseus and Heracles were said to have consulted it, the former\r\nwhen he was despatched by Polydectes[361] against the Gorgons, and\r\nthe latter, when he visited Antaeus[362] in Libya and Busiris[363] in\r\nEgypt. Alexander was also partly urged by a desire of emulating Perseus\r\nand Heracles, from both of whom he traced his descent.[364] He also\r\ndeduced his pedigree from Ammon, just as the legends traced that of\r\nHeracles and Perseus to Zeus. Accordingly he made the expedition to\r\nAmmon with the design of learning his own origin more certainly, or at\r\nleast that he might be able to say that he had learned it. According\r\nto Aristobulus, he advanced along the seashore to Paraetonium through\r\na country which was a desert, but not destitute of water, a distance\r\nof about 1,600 stades.[365] Thence he turned into the interior, where\r\nthe oracle of Ammon was located. The route is desert, and most of it is\r\nsand and destitute of water. But there was a copious supply of rain for\r\nAlexander, a thing which was attributed to the influence of the deity;\r\nas was also the following occurrence. Whenever a south wind blows\r\nin that district, it heaps up the sand upon the route far and wide,\r\nrendering the tracks of the road invisible, so that it is impossible\r\nto discover where one ought to direct one’s course in the sand, just\r\nas if one were at sea; for there are no landmarks along the road,\r\nneither mountain anywhere, nor tree, nor permanent hill standing erect,\r\nby which travellers might be able to form a conjecture of the right\r\ncourse, as sailors do by the stars.[366] Consequently, Alexander’s\r\narmy lost the way, and even the guides were in doubt about the course\r\nto take. Ptolemy, son of Lagus, says that two serpents went in front\r\nof the army, uttering a voice, and Alexander ordered the guides to\r\nfollow them, trusting in the divine portent. He says too that they\r\nshowed the way to the oracle and back again. But Aristobulus, whose\r\naccount is generally admitted as correct, says that two ravens flew in\r\nfront of the army, and that these acted as Alexander’s guides. I am\r\nable to assert with confidence that some divine assistance was afforded\r\nhim, for probability also coincides with the supposition; but the\r\ndiscrepancies in the details of the various narratives have deprived\r\nthe story of certainty.[367]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE OASIS OF AMMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place where the temple of Ammon is located is entirely surrounded\r\nby a desert of far-stretching sand, which is destitute of water. The\r\nfertile spot in the midst of this desert, is not extensive; for where\r\nit stretches into its greater expanse, it is only about forty stades\r\nbroad.[368] It is full of cultivated trees, olives and palms; and it\r\nis the only place in those parts which is refreshed with dew. A spring\r\nalso rises from it, quite unlike all the other springs which issue from\r\nthe earth.[369] For at midday the water is cold to the taste, and\r\nstill more so to the touch, as cold as cold can be. But when the sun\r\nhas sunk into the west, it gets warmer, and from the evening it keeps\r\non growing warmer until midnight, when it reaches the warmest point.\r\nAfter midnight it goes on getting gradually colder; at daybreak it is\r\nalready cold; but at midday it reaches the coldest point. Every day it\r\nundergoes these alternate changes in regular succession. In this place\r\nalso natural salt is procured by digging, and certain of the priests\r\nof Ammon convey quantities of it into Egypt. For whenever they set out\r\nfor Egypt they put it into little boxes plaited out of palm, and carry\r\nit as a present to the king, or some other great man. The grains of\r\nthis salt are large, some of them being even longer than three fingers’\r\nbreadth; and it is clear like crystal.[370] The Egyptians and others\r\nwho are respectful to the deity, use this salt in their sacrifices, as\r\nit is clearer than that which is procured from the sea. Alexander then\r\nwas struck with wonder at the place, and consulted the oracle of the\r\ngod. Having heard what was agreeable to his wishes, as he himself said,\r\nhe set out on the journey back to Egypt by the same route, according to\r\nthe statement of Aristobulus; but according to that of Ptolemy, son of\r\nLagus, he took another road, leading straight to Memphis.[371]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT OF THE AFFAIRS OF EGYPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Memphis, many embassies from Greece reached him; and he sent away\r\nno one disappointed by the rejection of his suit. From Antipater\r\nalso arrived an army of 400 Grecian mercenaries under the command of\r\nMenidas, son of Hegesander: likewise from Thrace 500 cavalry, under\r\nthe direction of Asclepiodorus, son of Eunicus. Here he offered\r\nsacrifice to Zeus the King, led his soldiers fully armed in solemn\r\nprocession, and celebrated a gymnastic and musical contest. He then\r\nsettled the affairs of Egypt, by appointing two Egyptians, Doloaspis\r\nand Petisis, governors of the country, dividing between them the\r\nwhole land; but as Petisis declined his province, Doloaspis received\r\nthe whole. He appointed two of the Companions to be commandants of\r\ngarrisons: Pantaleon the Pydnaean in Memphis, and Polemo, son of\r\nMegacles, a Pellaean, in Pelusium. He also gave the command of the\r\nGrecian auxiliaries to Lycidas, an Aetolian, and appointed Eugnostus,\r\nson of Xenophantes, one of the Companions, to be secretary over the\r\nsame troops. As their overseers he placed Aeschўlus and Ephippus the\r\nChalcidean. The government of the neighbouring country of Libya he\r\ngranted to Apollonius, son of Charinus; and the part of Arabia near\r\nHeroöpolis[372] he put under Cleomenes, a man of Naucratis.[373] This\r\nlast was ordered to allow the governors to rule their respective\r\ndistricts according to the ancient custom; but to collect from them the\r\ntribute due to him. The native governors were also ordered to pay it to\r\nCleomenes. He appointed Peucestas, son of Macartatus, and Balacrus, son\r\nof Amyntas, generals of the army which he left behind in Egypt; and he\r\nplaced Polemo, son of Theramenes, over the fleet as admiral. He made\r\nLeonnatus, son of Anteas, one of his body-guards instead of Arrhybas,\r\nwho had died of disease. Antiochus, the commander of the archers, also\r\ndied; and in his stead Ombrion the Cretan was appointed. When Balacrus\r\nwas left behind in Egypt, the allied Grecian infantry, which had been\r\nunder his command, was put under that of Calanus. Alexander was said\r\nto have divided the government of Egypt among so many men, because he\r\nwas surprised at the natural strength of the country, and he thought it\r\nunsafe to entrust the rule of the whole to a single person. The Romans\r\nalso seem to me to have learned a lesson from him, and therefore keep\r\nEgypt under strong guard; for they do not send any of the senators\r\nthither as proconsul for the same reason, but only men who have the\r\nrank among them of Equites (Knights).[374]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMARCH INTO SYRIA.—ALEXANDER’S KINDNESS TO HARPALUS AND HIS OTHER EARLY\r\nADHERENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as spring began to appear, he went from Memphis to Phoenicia,\r\nbridging the stream of the Nile near Memphis, as well as the canals\r\nissuing from it. When he arrived at Tyre, he found his fleet already\r\nthere.[375] In this city he again offered sacrifice to Heracles, and\r\ncelebrated both a gymnastic and musical contest. While there, the\r\nstate vessel called the _Paralus_ came to him from Athens, bringing\r\nDiophantus and Achilleus as envoys to him; and all the crew of the\r\n_Paralus_ were joined with them in the embassy.[376] These men obtained\r\nall the requests which they were despatched to make, and the king gave\r\nup to the Athenians all their fellow-citizens who had been captured at\r\nthe Granicus.[377] Being informed that revolutionary plans had been\r\ncarried out in the Peloponnese, he sent Amphoterus thither to assist\r\nthose of the Peloponnesians who were firm in their support of his war\r\nagainst Persia, and were not under the control of the Lacedaemonians.\r\nHe also commanded the Phoenicians and Cyprians to despatch to the\r\nPeloponnese 100 other ships in addition to those which he was sending\r\nwith Amphoterus. He now started up into the interior towards Thapsacus\r\nand the river Euphrates, after placing Coeranus, a Beroean[378] over\r\nthe levy of tribute in Phoenicia, and Philoxenus to collect it in\r\nAsia as far as the Taurus. In the place of these men he entrusted\r\nthe custody of the money which he had with him to Harpalus, son of\r\nMachatas, who had just returned from exile. For this man at first had\r\nbeen banished, while Philip was still king, because he was an adherent\r\nof Alexander; as also was Ptolemy, son of Lagus, for the same reason;\r\nlikewise Nearchus, son of Androtimus, Erigyius, son of Larichus, and\r\nhis brother Laomedon. For Alexander fell under Philip’s suspicion\r\nwhen the latter married Eurydice[379] and treated Alexander’s mother\r\nOlympias with dishonour. But after Philip’s death those who had been\r\nbanished on Alexander’s account returned from exile and were received\r\ninto favour. He made Ptolemy one of his confidential body-guards; he\r\nplaced Harpalus over the money, because his bodily strength was unequal\r\nto the fatigues of war. Erigyius was made commander of the allied\r\nGrecian cavalry; and his brother Laomedon, because he could speak both\r\nthe Greek and Persian languages and could read Persian writings, was\r\nput in charge of the foreign prisoners. Nearchus also was appointed\r\nviceroy of Lycia and of the land adjacent to it as far as mount Taurus.\r\nBut shortly before the battle which was fought at Issus, Harpalus fell\r\nunder the influence of Tauriscus, an evil man, and fled in his company.\r\nThe latter started off to Alexander the Epirote[380] in Italy, where\r\nhe soon after died. But Harpalus found a refuge in Megaris, whence\r\nhowever Alexander persuaded him to return, giving him a pledge that\r\nhe should be none the worse on account of his desertion. When he came\r\nback, he not only received no punishment, but was even reinstated in\r\nthe office of treasurer. Menander, one of the Companions, was sent away\r\ninto Lydia as viceroy; and Clearchus was put in command of the Grecian\r\nauxiliaries who had been under Menander. Asclepiodorus, son of Eunicus,\r\nwas also appointed viceroy of Syria instead of Arimmas, because the\r\nlatter seemed to have been remiss in collecting the supplies which he\r\nhad been ordered to collect for the army which the king was about to\r\nlead into the interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE EUPHRATES AND TIGRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander arrived at Thapsacus in the month Hecatombaion,[381] in the\r\narchonship of Aristophanes at Athens; and he found that two bridges\r\nof boats had been constructed over the stream. But Mazaeus, to whom\r\nDarius had committed the duty of guarding the river, with about 3,000\r\ncavalry, 2,000 of which were Grecian mercenaries, was up to that time\r\nkeeping guard there at the river. For this reason the Macedonians had\r\nnot constructed the complete bridge as far as the opposite bank, being\r\nafraid that Mazaeus might make an assault upon the bridge where it\r\nended. But when he heard that Alexander was approaching, he went off\r\nin flight with all his army. As soon as he had fled, the bridges were\r\ncompleted as far as the further bank, and Alexander crossed upon them\r\nwith his army.[382] Thence he marched up into the interior through the\r\nland called Mesopotamia, having the river Euphrates and the mountains\r\nof Armenia on his left. When he started from the Euphrates he did not\r\nmarch to Babylon by the direct road; because by going the other route\r\nhe found all things easier for the march of his army, and it was also\r\neasier to obtain fodder for the horses and provisions for the men\r\nfrom the country. Besides this, the heat was not so scorching on the\r\nindirect route. Some of the men from Darius’s army, who were dispersed\r\nfor the purpose of scouting, were taken prisoners; and they reported\r\nthat Darius was encamped near the river Tigris, having resolved to\r\nprevent Alexander from crossing that stream. They also said that he\r\nhad a much larger army than that with which he had fought in Cilicia.\r\nHearing this, Alexander went with all speed towards the Tigris; but\r\nwhen he reached it he found neither Darius himself nor any guard which\r\nhe had left. However he experienced great difficulty in crossing the\r\nstream, on account of the swiftness of the current,[383] though no one\r\ntried to stop him. There he made his army rest, and while so doing, an\r\neclipse of the moon nearly total occurred.[384] Alexander thereupon\r\noffered sacrifice to the moon, the sun and the earth, whose deed this\r\nwas, according to common report. Aristander thought that this eclipse\r\nof the moon was a portent favourable to Alexander and the Macedonians;\r\nthat there would be a battle that very month, and that victory for\r\nAlexander was signified by the sacrificial victims. Having therefore\r\ndecamped from the Tigris, he went through the land of Aturia,[385]\r\nhaving the mountains of the Gordyaeans[386] on the left and the Tigris\r\nitself on the right; and on the fourth day after the passage of the\r\nriver, his scouts brought word to him that the enemy’s cavalry were\r\nvisible there along the plain, but how many of them there were they\r\ncould not guess. Accordingly he drew his army up in order and advanced\r\nprepared for battle. Other scouts again riding forward and taking more\r\naccurate observations, told him that the cavalry did not seem to them\r\nto be more than 1,000 in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF DARIUS’S ARMY AT ARBELA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander therefore took the royal squadron of cavalry, and one\r\nsquadron of the Companions, together with the Paeonian scouts, and\r\nmarched with all speed; having ordered the rest of his army to follow\r\nat leisure. The Persian cavalry, seeing Alexander advancing quickly,\r\nbegan to flee with all their might. Though he pressed close upon\r\nthem in pursuit, most of them escaped; but a few, whose horses were\r\nfatigued by the flight, were slain, others were taken prisoners,\r\nhorses and all. From these they ascertained that Darius with a large\r\nforce was not far off. For the Indians who were conterminous with\r\nthe Bactrians, as also the Bactrians themselves and the Sogdianians\r\nhad come to the aid of Darius, all being under the command of Bessus,\r\nthe viceroy of the land of Bactria. They were accompanied by the\r\nSacians, a Scythian tribe belonging to the Scythians who dwell in\r\nAsia.[387] These were not subject to Bessus, but were in alliance\r\nwith Darius. They were commanded by Mavaces, and were horse-bowmen.\r\nBarsaëntes, the viceroy of Arachotia, led the Arachotians[388] and the\r\nmen who were called mountaineer Indians. Satibarzanes, the viceroy\r\nof Areia, led the Areians,[389] as did Phrataphernes the Parthians,\r\nHyrcanians, and Tapurians,[390] all of whom were horsemen. Atropates\r\ncommanded the Medes, with whom were arrayed the Cadusians, Albanians,\r\nand Sacesinians.[391] The men who dwelt near the Red Sea[392] were\r\nmarshalled by Ocondobates, Ariobarzanes, and Otanes. The Uxians and\r\nSusianians[393] acknowledged Oxathres son of Aboulites as their\r\nleader, and the Babylonians were commanded by Boupares. The Carians\r\nwho had been deported into central Asia, and the Sitacenians[394]\r\nhad been placed in the same ranks as the Babylonians. The Armenians\r\nwere commanded by Orontes and Mithraustes, and the Cappadocians by\r\nAriaces. The Syrians from the vale between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon\r\n(_i.e._ Coele-Syria) and the men of Syria which lies between the\r\nrivers[395] were led by Mazaeus. The whole army of Darius was said to\r\ncontain 40,000 cavalry, 1,000,000 infantry, and 200 scythe-bearing\r\nchariots.[396] There were only a few elephants, about fifteen in\r\nnumber, belonging to the Indians who live this side of the Indus.[397]\r\nWith these forces Darius had encamped at Gaugamela, near the river\r\nBumodus, about 600 stades distant from the city of Arbela, in a\r\ndistrict everywhere level;[398] for whatever ground thereabouts was\r\nunlevel and unfit for the evolutions of cavalry, had long before been\r\nlevelled by the Persians, and made fit for the easy rolling of chariots\r\nand for the galloping of horses. For there were some who persuaded\r\nDarius that he had forsooth got the worst of it in the battle fought\r\nat Issus, from the narrowness of the battle-field; and this he was\r\neasily induced to believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S TACTICS.—HIS SPEECH TO THE OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander had received all this information from the Persian\r\nscouts who had been captured, he remained four days in the place where\r\nhe had received the news; and gave his army rest after the march. He\r\nmeanwhile fortified his camp with a ditch and stockade, as he intended\r\nto leave behind the baggage and all the soldiers who were unfit for\r\nfighting, and to go into the contest accompanied by his warriors\r\ncarrying with them nothing except their weapons. Accordingly he took\r\nhis forces by night, and began the march about the second watch, in\r\norder to come into collision with the foreigners at break of day. As\r\nsoon as Darius was informed of Alexander’s approach, he at once drew\r\nout his army for battle; and Alexander led on his men drawn up in like\r\nmanner. Though the armies were only sixty stades[399] from each other,\r\nyet they were not in sight of each other, for between the hostile\r\nforces some hills intervened. But when Alexander was only thirty stades\r\ndistant from the enemy, and his army was already marching down from the\r\nhills just mentioned, catching sight of the foreigners, he caused his\r\nphalanx to halt there. Calling a council of the Companions, generals,\r\ncavalry officers, and leaders of the Grecian allies and mercenaries,\r\nhe deliberated with them, whether he should at once lead on the\r\nphalanx without delay, as most of them urged him to do; or, whether,\r\nas Parmenio thought preferable, to pitch their tents there for the\r\npresent, to reconnoitre all the ground, in order to see if there was\r\nanything there to excite suspicion or to impede their progress, or if\r\nthere were ditches or stakes firmly fixed in the earth out of sight,\r\nas well as to make a more accurate survey of the enemy’s tactical\r\narrangements. Parmenio’s opinion prevailed, so they encamped there,\r\ndrawn up in the order in which they intended to enter the battle. But\r\nAlexander took the light infantry and the cavalry Companions and went\r\nall round, reconnoitring the whole country where he was about to fight\r\nthe battle. Having returned, he again called together the same leaders,\r\nand said that they did not require to be encouraged by him to enter the\r\ncontest; for they had been long before encouraged by their own valour,\r\nand by the gallant deeds which they had already so often achieved. He\r\nthought it expedient that each of them individually should stir up\r\nhis own men separately; the infantry captain the men of his company,\r\nthe cavalry captain his own squadron, the brigadiers their various\r\nbrigades, and each of the leaders of the infantry the phalanx entrusted\r\nto him. He assured them that in this battle they were going to fight,\r\nnot as before, either for Coele-Syria, Phoenicia, or Egypt, but for\r\nthe whole of Asia. For he said this battle would decide who were to\r\nbe the rulers of that continent. It was not necessary for him to stir\r\nthem up to gallant deeds by many words, since they had this valour by\r\nnature; but they should see that each man took care, so far as in him\r\nlay, to preserve discipline in the critical moment of action, and to\r\nkeep perfect silence when it was expedient to advance in silence. On\r\nthe other hand, they should see that each man uttered a sonorous shout,\r\nwhere it would be advantageous to shout, and to raise as terrible a\r\nbattle-cry as possible, when a suitable opportunity occurred of raising\r\nthe battle-cry. He told them to take care to obey his orders as quickly\r\nas possible, and to transmit the orders they had received to the ranks\r\nwith all rapidity; each man remembering that both as an individual\r\nand in the aggregate he was increasing the general danger if he was\r\nremiss in the discharge of his duty, and that he was assisting to gain\r\na victory if he zealously put forth his utmost exertions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nREJECTION OF PARMENIO’S ADVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these words and others like them he briefly exhorted his officers,\r\nand in return was exhorted by them to feel confidence in their valour.\r\nHe then ordered the soldiers to take dinner and to rest themselves.\r\nIt is said that Parmenio came to him in his tent, and urged him to\r\nmake a night attack on the Persians; saying that thus he would fall\r\nupon them unprepared and in a state of confusion, and at the same time\r\nmore liable to a panic in the dark.[400] But the reply which he made,\r\nas others were listening to their conversation, was, that it would be\r\nmean to steal a victory, and that Alexander ought to conquer in open\r\ndaylight, and without any artifice. This vaunting did not appear any\r\narrogance on his part, but rather to indicate self-confidence amid\r\ndangers. To me at any rate, he seems to have used correct reasoning\r\nin such a matter. For in the night many accidents have occurred\r\nunexpectedly to those who were sufficiently prepared for battle as\r\nwell as to those who were deficiently prepared, which have caused the\r\nsuperior party to fail in their plans, and have handed the victory\r\nover to the inferior party, contrary to the expectations of both\r\nsides. Though Alexander was generally fond of encountering danger in\r\nbattle, the night appeared to him perilous; and, besides, if Darius\r\nwere again defeated, a furtive and nocturnal attack on the part of\r\nthe Macedonians would relieve him of the necessity of confessing that\r\nhe was an inferior general and commanded inferior troops. Moreover, if\r\nany unexpected defeat befell his army, the circumjacent country was\r\nfriendly to the enemy, and they were acquainted with the locality,\r\nwhereas the Macedonians[401] were unacquainted with it, and surrounded\r\nby nothing but foes, of whom there were a great number prisoners.\r\nThese would be a great source of anxiety, as they would be likely to\r\nassist in attacking them in the night, not only if they should meet\r\nwith defeat, but even if they did not appear to be gaining a decisive\r\nvictory. For this way of reasoning I commend Alexander; and I think him\r\nno less worthy of admiration for his excessive desire to fight in open\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTACTICS OF THE OPPOSING GENERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarius and his army remained drawn up during the night in the same\r\norder as that in which they had first arrayed themselves; because\r\nthey had not surrounded themselves with a completely entrenched camp,\r\nand, moreover, they were afraid that the enemy would attack them\r\nin the night. The success of the Persians, on this occasion, was\r\nimpeded especially by this long standing on watch with their arms,\r\nand by the fear which usually springs up before great dangers; which,\r\nhowever, was not then suddenly aroused by a momentary panic, but had\r\nbeen experienced for a long time, and had thoroughly cowed their\r\nspirits.[402] The army of Darius was drawn up in the following manner:\r\nfor, according to the statement of Aristobulus, the written scheme of\r\narrangement drawn up by Darius was afterwards captured. His left wing\r\nwas held by the Bactrian cavalry, in conjunction with the Daans[403]\r\nand Arachotians; near these had been posted the Persians, horse and\r\nfoot mixed together; next to these the Susians, and then the Cadusians.\r\nThis was the arrangement of the left wing as far as the middle of the\r\nwhole phalanx. On the right had been posted the men from Coele-Syria\r\nand Mesopotamia. On the right again were the Medes; next to them the\r\nParthians and Sacians; then the Tapurians and Hyrcanians, and last\r\nthe Albanians and Sacesinians, extending as far as the middle of the\r\nwhole phalanx. In the centre where King Darius was, had been posted\r\nthe king’s kinsmen,[404] the Persian guards carrying spears with\r\ngolden apples at the butt end,[405] the Indians, the Carians who had\r\nbeen forcibly removed to Central Asia, and the Mardian archers.[406]\r\nThe Uxians, the Babylonians, the men who dwell near the Red Sea, and\r\nthe Sitacenians had also been drawn up in deep column. On the left,\r\nopposite Alexander’s right, had been posted the Scythian cavalry, about\r\n1,000 Bactrians and 100 scythe-bearing chariots. In front of Darius’s\r\nroyal squadron of cavalry stood the elephants and 50 chariots. In\r\nfront of the right wing the Armenian and Cappadocian cavalry with 50\r\nscythe-bearing chariots had been posted. The Greek mercenaries, as\r\nalone capable of coping with the Macedonians, were stationed right\r\nopposite their phalanx, in two divisions close beside Darius himself\r\nand his Persian attendants, one division on each side.[407]\r\n\r\nAlexander’s army was marshalled as follows: The right wing was held\r\nby the cavalry Companions, in front of whom had been posted the royal\r\nsquadron, commanded by Clitus, son of Dropidas. Near this was the\r\nsquadron of Glaucias, next to it that of Aristo, then that of Sopolis,\r\nson of Hermodorus, then that of Heraclides, son of Antiochus. Near\r\nthis was that of Demetrius, son of Althaemenes, then that of Meleager,\r\nand last one of the royal squadrons commanded by Hegelochus, son of\r\nHippostratus. All the cavalry Companions were under the supreme command\r\nof Philotas, son of Parmenio. Of the phalanx of Macedonian infantry,\r\nnearest to the cavalry had been posted first the select corps of\r\nshield-bearing guards, and then the rest of the shield-bearing-guards,\r\nunder the command of Nicanor, son of Parmenio. Next to these was the\r\nbrigade of Coenus, son of Polemocrates; after these that of Perdiceas,\r\nson of Orontes, then that of Meleager, son of Neoptolemus, then that\r\nof Polysperchon,[408] son of Simmias, and last that of Amyntas, son\r\nof Andromenes, under the command of Simmias, because Amyntas had been\r\ndespatched to Macedonia to levy an army. The brigade of Craterus, son\r\nof Alexander, held the left end of the Macedonian phalanx, and this\r\ngeneral commanded the left wing of the infantry.[409] Next to him was\r\nthe allied Grecian cavalry, under the command of Erigyius, son of\r\nLarichus. Next to these, towards the left wing of the army, were the\r\nThessalian cavalry, under the command of Philip, son of Menelaüs. But\r\nthe whole left wing was led by Parmenio, son of Philotas, round whose\r\nperson were ranged the Pharsalian horsemen, who were both the best and\r\nmost numerous squadron of the Thessalian cavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S TACTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way had Alexander marshalled his army in front; but he also\r\nposted a second array, so that his phalanx might be a double one.[410]\r\nDirections had been given to the commanders of these men posted in\r\nreserve, to wheel round and receive the attack of the foreigners, if\r\nthey should see their own comrades surrounded by the Persian army. Next\r\nto the royal squadron on the right wing, half of the Agrianians, under\r\nthe command of Attalus, in conjunction with the Macedonian archers\r\nunder Briso’s command, were posted angular-wise (_i.e._ in such a way\r\nthat the wings were thrown forward at an angle with the centre, so as\r\nto take the enemy in flank) in case they should be seized anyhow by\r\nthe necessity of folding back the phalanx or of closing it up (_i.e._\r\nof deepening it by countermarching from front to rear). Next to the\r\narchers were the men called the veteran mercenaries, whose commander\r\nwas Cleander. In front of the Agrianians and archers were posted the\r\nlight cavalry used for skirmishing, and the Paeonians, under the\r\ncommand of Aretes and Aristo. In front of all had been posted the\r\nGrecian mercenary cavalry under the direction of Menidas; and in\r\nfront of the royal squadron of cavalry and the other Companions had\r\nbeen posted half of the Agrianians and archers, and the javelin-men\r\nof Balacrus who had been ranged opposite the scythe-bearing chariots.\r\nInstructions had been given to Menidas and the troops under him to\r\nwheel round and attack the enemy in flank, if they should ride round\r\ntheir wing. Thus had Alexander arranged matters on the right wing. On\r\nthe left the Thracians under the command of Sitalces had been posted\r\nangular-wise, and near them the cavalry of the Grecian allies, under\r\nthe direction of Coeranus. Next stood the Odrysian cavalry, under the\r\ncommand of Agatho, son of Tyrimmas. In this part, in front of all, were\r\nposted the auxiliary cavalry of the Grecian mercenaries, under the\r\ndirection of Andromachus, son of Hiero. Near the baggage the infantry\r\nfrom Thrace were posted as a guard. The whole of Alexander’s army\r\nnumbered 7,000 cavalry and about 40,000 infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF ARBELA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the armies drew near each other, Darius and the men around\r\nhim were observed; viz. the apple-bearing Persians, the Indians,\r\nthe Albanians, the Carians who had been forcibly transported into\r\nCentral Asia, the Mardian archers ranged opposite Alexander himself\r\nand his royal squadron of cavalry. Alexander led his own army more\r\ntowards the right, and the Persians marched along parallel with him,\r\nfar outflanking him upon their left.[411] Then the Scythian cavalry\r\nrode along the line, and came into conflict with the front men of\r\nAlexander’s array; but he nevertheless still continued to march towards\r\nthe right, and almost entirely got beyond the ground which had been\r\ncleared and levelled by the Persians.[412] Then Darius, fearing that\r\nhis chariots would become useless, if the Macedonians advanced into\r\nuneven ground, ordered the front ranks of his left wing to ride round\r\nthe right wing of the Macedonians, where Alexander was commanding,\r\nto prevent him from marching his wing any further. This being done,\r\nAlexander ordered the cavalry of the Grecian mercenaries under the\r\ncommand of Menidas to attack them. But the Scythian cavalry and the\r\nBactrians, who had been drawn up with them sallied forth against them,\r\nand being much more numerous they put the small body of Greeks to rout.\r\nAlexander then ordered Aristo at the head of the Paeonians and Grecian\r\nauxiliaries to attack the Scythians; and the barbarians gave way. But\r\nthe rest of the Bactrians drawing near to the Paeonians and Grecian\r\nauxiliaries, caused their own comrades who were already in flight\r\nto turn and renew the battle; and thus they brought about a general\r\ncavalry engagement, in which many of Alexander’s men fell, not only\r\nbeing overwhelmed by the multitude of the barbarians, but also because\r\nthe Scythians themselves and their horses were much more completely\r\nprotected with armour for guarding their bodies.[413] Notwithstanding\r\nthis, the Macedonians sustained their assaults, and assailing them\r\nviolently squadron by squadron, they succeeded in pushing them out of\r\nrank. Meantime the foreigners launched their scythe-bearing chariots\r\nagainst Alexander himself, for the purpose of throwing his phalanx into\r\nconfusion; but in this they were grievously deceived. For as soon\r\nas some of them approached, the Agrianians and the javelin-men with\r\nBalacrus, who had been posted in front of the Companion cavalry, hurled\r\ntheir javelins at them; others they seized by the reins and pulled the\r\ndrivers off, and standing round the horses killed them. Yet some rolled\r\nright through the ranks; for the men stood apart and opened their\r\nranks, as they had been instructed, in the places where the chariots\r\nassaulted them. In this way it generally happened that the chariots\r\npassed through safely, and the men by whom they were driven were\r\nuninjured. But these also were afterwards overpowered by the grooms of\r\nAlexander’s army and by the royal shield-bearing guards.[414]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ARBELA.—FLIGHT OF DARIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as Darius began to set his whole phalanx in motion, Alexander\r\nordered Aretes to attack those who were riding completely round his\r\nright wing; and up to that time he was himself leading his men in\r\ncolumn. But when the Persians had made a break in the front line of\r\ntheir army, in consequence of the cavalry sallying forth to assist\r\nthose who were surrounding the right wing, Alexander wheeled round\r\ntowards the gap, and forming a wedge as it were of the Companion\r\ncavalry and of the part of the phalanx which was posted here, he led\r\nthem with a quick charge and loud battle-cry straight towards Darius\r\nhimself. For a short time there ensued a hand-to-hand fight; but when\r\nthe Macedonian cavalry, commanded by Alexander himself, pressed on\r\nvigorously, thrusting themselves against the Persians and striking\r\ntheir faces with their spears, and when the Macedonian phalanx in\r\ndense array and bristling[415] with long pikes had also made an attack\r\nupon them, all things at once appeared full of terror to Darius, who\r\nhad already long been in a state of fear, so that he was the first\r\nto turn and flee.[416] The Persians also who were riding round the\r\nwing were seized with alarm when Aretes made a vigorous attack upon\r\nthem. In this quarter indeed the Persians took to speedy flight; and\r\nthe Macedonians followed up the fugitives and slaughtered them.[417]\r\nSimmias and his brigade were not yet able to start with Alexander in\r\npursuit, but causing the phalanx to halt there, he took part in the\r\nstruggle, because the left wing of the Macedonians was reported to\r\nbe hard pressed. In this part of the field, their line being broken,\r\nsome of the Indians and of the Persian cavalry burst through the gap\r\ntowards the baggage of the Macedonians; and there the action became\r\ndesperate. For the Persians fell boldly on the men, who were most of\r\nthem unarmed, and never expected that any men would cut through the\r\ndouble phalanx and break through upon them.[418] When the Persians made\r\nthis attack, the foreign prisoners also assisted them by falling upon\r\nthe Macedonians in the midst of the action. But the commanders of the\r\nmen who had been posted as a reserve to the first phalanx, learning\r\nwhat was taking place, quickly moved from the position which they had\r\nbeen ordered to take, and coming upon the Persians in the rear, killed\r\nmany of them there collected round the baggage. But the rest of them\r\ngave way and fled. The Persians on the right wing, who had not yet\r\nbecome aware of the flight of Darius, rode round Alexander’s left wing\r\nand attacked Parmenio in flank.[419]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF THE PERSIANS AND PURSUIT OF DARIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, while the Macedonians were doubtful as to the result\r\nof the battle, Parmenio sent a messenger to Alexander in haste, to\r\ntell him that their side was in a critical position and that he\r\nmust send him aid.[420] When this news was brought to Alexander, he\r\nimmediately turned back again from the pursuit, and wheeling round with\r\nthe Companion cavalry, led them with great speed against the right\r\nwing of the foreigners. In the first place he assaulted the fleeing\r\ncavalry of the enemy, the Parthians, some of the Indians, and the most\r\nnumerous and the bravest division of the Persians. Then ensued the\r\nmost obstinately contested cavalry fight in the whole engagement. For\r\nbeing drawn up by squadrons as it were, the foreigners wheeled round\r\nand falling on Alexander’s men face to face, they no longer relied on\r\nthe hurling of javelins or the dexterous deploying of horses, as is the\r\ncommon practice in cavalry battles, but every one on his own account\r\nstrove eagerly to break through what stood in his way, as if this\r\nwere their only means of safety. They struck and were struck without\r\nquarter, as if they were no longer struggling to secure the victory for\r\nanother, but were contending for their own personal safety. Here about\r\nsixty of Alexander’s Companions fell; and Hephaestion himself, as well\r\nas Coenus and Menidas, was wounded. But even these troops were overcome\r\nby Alexander; and as many of them as could force their way through\r\nhis ranks fled with all their might. And now Alexander had nearly\r\ncome into conflict with the enemy’s right wing, but in the meantime\r\nthe Thessalian cavalry in a splendid struggle, had not fallen short\r\nof Alexander’s success in the engagement. For the foreigners on the\r\nright wing were already beginning to fly when he came on the scene of\r\nconflict; so that he wheeled round again and started off in pursuit of\r\nDarius once more, keeping up the chase as long as there was daylight.\r\nParmenio’s brigade also followed in pursuit of those who were opposed\r\nto them. But Alexander crossed the river Lycus[421] and pitched his\r\ncamp there, to give his men and horses a little rest; while Parmenio\r\nseized the Persian camp with their baggage, elephants, and camels.\r\nAfter giving his horsemen rest until midnight, Alexander again advanced\r\nby a forced march towards Arbela, with the hope of seizing Darius\r\nthere, together with his money and the rest of his royal property. He\r\nreached Arbela the next day, having pursued altogether about 600 stades\r\nfrom the battle-field.[422] But as Darius went on fleeing without\r\ntaking any rest,[423] he did not find him at Arbela. However the money\r\nand all the other property were captured, as was also the chariot of\r\nDarius. His spear and bow were likewise taken, as had been the case\r\nafter the battle of Issus.[424] Of Alexander’s men about 100 were\r\nkilled, and more than 1,000 of his horses were lost either from wounds\r\nor from fatigue in the pursuit, nearly half of them belonging to the\r\nCompanion cavalry. Of the foreigners there were said to have been about\r\n300,000 slain, and far more were taken prisoners than were killed.[425]\r\nThe elephants and all the chariots which had not been destroyed in the\r\nbattle were also captured. Such was the result of this battle, which\r\nwas fought in the archonship of Aristophanes at Athens, in the month\r\nPyanepsion;[426] and thus Aristander’s prediction was accomplished,\r\nthat Alexander would both fight a battle and gain a victory in the same\r\nmonth in which the moon was seen to be eclipsed.[427]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nESCAPE OF DARIUS INTO MEDIA.—MARCH OF ALEXANDER TO BABYLON AND SUSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after the battle, Darius marched through the mountains\r\nof Armenia towards Media, accompanied in his flight by the Bactrian\r\ncavalry, as they had then been posted with him in the battle; also by\r\nthose Persians who were called the king’s kinsmen, and by a few of the\r\nmen called apple-bearers.[428] About 2,000 of his Grecian mercenaries\r\nalso accompanied him in his flight, under the command of Paron the\r\nPhocian, and Glaucus the Aetolian. He fled towards Media for this\r\nreason, because he thought Alexander would take the road to Susa and\r\nBabylon immediately after the battle, inasmuch as the whole of that\r\ncountry was inhabited and the road was not difficult for the transit\r\nof baggage; and besides Babylon and Susa appeared to be the prizes of\r\nthe war; whereas the road towards Media was by no means easy for the\r\nmarch of a large army. In this conjecture Darius was mistaken; for when\r\nAlexander started from Arbela, he advanced straight towards Babylon;\r\nand when he was now not far from that city, he drew up his army in\r\norder of battle and marched forward. The Babylonians came out to meet\r\nhim in mass, with their priests and rulers, each of whom individually\r\nbrought gifts, and offered to surrender their city, citadel, and\r\nmoney.[429] Entering the city, he commanded the Babylonians to rebuild\r\nall the temples which Xerxes had destroyed, and especially that of\r\nBelus, whom the Babylonians venerate more than any other god.[430]\r\nHe then appointed Mazaeus viceroy of the Babylonians, Apollodorus\r\nthe Amphipolitan general of the soldiers who were left behind with\r\nMazaeus, and Asclepiodorus, son of Philo, collector of the revenue. He\r\nalso sent Mithrines, who had surrendered to him the citadel of Sardis,\r\ndown into Armenia to be viceroy there.[431] Here also he met with\r\nthe Chaldaeans; and whatever they directed in regard to the religious\r\nrites of Babylon he performed, and in particular he offered sacrifice\r\nto Belus according to their instructions.[432] He then marched away\r\nto Susa[433]; and on the way he was met by the son of the viceroy of\r\nthe Susians,[434] and a man bearing a letter from Philoxenus, whom\r\nhe had despatched to Susa directly after the battle. In the letter\r\nPhiloxenus had written that the Susians had surrendered their city to\r\nhim, and that all the money was safe for Alexander. In twenty days\r\nthe king arrived at Susa from Babylon; and entering the city he took\r\npossession of the money, which amounted to 50,000 talents, as well\r\nas the rest of the royal property.[435] Many other things were also\r\ncaptured there, which Xerxes brought with him from Greece, especially\r\nthe brazen statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton.[436] These Alexander\r\nsent back to the Athenians, and they are now standing at Athens in\r\nthe Ceramicus, where we go up into the Acropolis,[437] right opposite\r\nthe temple of Rhea, the mother of the gods, not far from the altar\r\nof the Eudanemi. Whoever has been initiated in the mysteries of the\r\ntwo goddesses[438] at Eleusis, knows the altar of Eudanemus which is\r\nupon the plain. At Susa Alexander offered sacrifice after the custom\r\nof his fathers, and celebrated a torch race and a gymnastic contest;\r\nand then, leaving Abulites, a Persian, as viceroy of Susiana, Mazarus,\r\none of his Companions, as commander of the garrison in the citadel\r\nof Susa, and Archelaüs, son of Theodorus, as general, he advanced\r\ntowards the land of the Persians. He also sent Menes down to the sea,\r\nas governor of Syria, Phœnicia, and Cilicia, giving him 3,000 talents\r\nof silver[439] to convey to the sea, with orders to despatch as many\r\nof them to Antipater as he might need to carry on the war against the\r\nLacedaemonians.[440] There also Amyntas, son of Andromenes, reached\r\nhim with the forces which he was leading from Macedonia[441]; of whom\r\nAlexander placed the horsemen in the ranks of the Companion cavalry,\r\nand the foot he added to the various regiments of infantry, arranging\r\neach according to nationalities. He also established two companies in\r\neach squadron of cavalry, whereas before this time companies did not\r\nexist in the cavalry; and over them he set as captains those of the\r\nCompanions who were pre-eminent for merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSUBJUGATION OF THE UXIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe now set out from Susa, and, crossing the river Pasitigris,[442]\r\ninvaded the country of the Uxians. Some of these people who inhabit\r\nthe plains were under the rule of the viceroy of the Persians, and on\r\nthis occasion surrendered to Alexander; but those who are called the\r\nmountaineers were not in subjection to the Persians, and at this time\r\nsent word to Alexander that they would not permit him to march with\r\nhis forces into Persis, unless they received from him as much as they\r\nwere in the habit of receiving from the king of the Persians for the\r\npassage through their mountains.[443] He sent the messengers back with\r\ninstructions to come to the defiles, the possession of which made them\r\nthink that the passage into Persis was in their power, promising them\r\nthat they should there receive from him the prescribed toll. He then\r\ntook the royal body-guards, the shield-bearing infantry, and 8,000 men\r\nfrom the rest of his army, and, under the guidance of the Susians,\r\nmarched by night along a different road from the frequented one.\r\nAdvancing by a route rough and difficult, on the same day he fell upon\r\nthe villages of the Uxians, where he captured much booty and killed\r\nmany of the people while still in their beds; but others escaped into\r\nthe mountains. He then made a forced march to the defiles, where the\r\nUxians resolved to meet him in mass in order to receive the prescribed\r\ntoll. But he had already previously despatched Craterus to seize the\r\nheights, to which he thought the Uxians would retire if they were\r\nrepelled by force; and he himself went, with great celerity, and got\r\npossession of the pass before their arrival. He then drew up his men in\r\nbattle array, and led them from the higher and more commanding position\r\nagainst the barbarians. They, being alarmed at Alexander’s celerity,\r\nand finding themselves deprived by stratagem[444] of the position in\r\nwhich they had especially confided, took to flight without ever coming\r\nto close combat. Some of them were killed by Alexander’s men in their\r\nflight, and many lost their lives by falling over the precipices along\r\nthe road; but most of them fled up into the mountains for refuge, and\r\nfalling in with Craterus, were destroyed by his men. Having received\r\nthese gifts of honour[445] from Alexander, they with difficulty, after\r\nmuch entreaty, procured from him the privilege of retaining possession\r\nof their own land on condition of paying him an annual tribute.\r\nPtolemy, son of Lagus, says that the mother of Darius,[446] on their\r\nbehalf, entreated Alexander to grant them the privilege of inhabiting\r\nthe land. The tribute agreed upon was a hundred horses, five hundred\r\noxen, and 30,000 sheep a year; for the Uxians had no money, nor was\r\ntheir country fit for tillage; but most of them were shepherds and\r\nherdsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF ARIOBARZANES AND CAPTURE OF PERSEPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, Alexander despatched Parmenio with the baggage, the\r\nThessalian cavalry, the Grecian allies, the mercenary auxiliaries,\r\nand the rest of the more heavily armed soldiers, to march into Persis\r\nalong the carriage road leading into that country. He himself took the\r\nMacedonian infantry, the Companion cavalry, the light cavalry used for\r\nskirmishing, the Agrianians, and the archers, and made a forced march\r\nthrough the mountains. But when he arrived at the Persian Gates, he\r\nfound that Ariobarzanes, the viceroy of Persis, with 40,000 infantry\r\nand 700 cavalry, had built a wall across the pass, and had pitched his\r\ncamp there near the wall to block Alexander’s passage. Then indeed he\r\npitched his camp there; but next day he marshalled his army, and led\r\nit up to the wall. When it was evident that it would be difficult to\r\ncapture it on account of the rugged nature of the ground, and as many\r\nof his men were being wounded, the enemy assailing them with missiles\r\nfrom engines of war placed upon higher ground, which gave them an\r\nadvantage over their assailants, he retreated to his camp. He was\r\ninformed by the prisoners that they could lead him round by another\r\nroute, so that he might get to the other end of the pass; but when he\r\nascertained that this road was rough and narrow, he left Craterus there\r\nat the camp with his own brigade and that of Meleager, as well as a\r\nfew archers and 500 cavalry, with orders that when he perceived he had\r\ngot right round and was approaching the camp of the Persians (which\r\nhe could easily perceive, because the trumpets would give him the\r\nsignal), he should then assault the wall. Alexander advanced by night,\r\nand travelling about 100 stades, he took the shield-bearing guards,\r\nthe brigade of Perdiccas, the lightest armed of the archers, the\r\nAgrianians, the royal squadron of cavalry Companions, and one regiment\r\nof cavalry besides these, containing four companies; and wheeling round\r\nwith these troops, he marched towards the pass in the direction the\r\nprisoners led him. He ordered Amyntas, Philotas, and Coenus to lead\r\nthe rest of the army towards the plain, and to make a bridge over the\r\nriver[447] which one must cross to go into Persis. He himself went\r\nby a route difficult and rough, along which he nevertheless marched\r\nfor the most part at full speed. Falling upon the first guard of the\r\nbarbarians before daylight,[448] he destroyed them, and so he did most\r\nof the second; but the majority of the third guard escaped, not indeed\r\nby fleeing into the camp of Ariobarzanes, but into the mountains as\r\nthey were, being seized with a sudden panic. Consequently He fell upon\r\nthe enemy’s camp at the approach of dawn without being observed. At the\r\nvery time he began to assault the trench, the trumpets gave the signal\r\nto Craterus, who at once attacked the advanced fortification. The enemy\r\nthen, being in a state of confusion from being attacked on all sides,\r\nfled without coming to close conflict; but they were hemmed in on all\r\nhands, Alexander pressing upon them in one direction and the men of\r\nCraterus running up in another. Therefore most of them were compelled\r\nto wheel round and flee into the fortifications, which were already in\r\nthe hands of the Macedonians. For Alexander, expecting the very thing\r\nwhich really occurred, had left Ptolemy there with three thousand\r\ninfantry; so that most of the barbarians were cut to pieces by the\r\nMacedonians at close quarters. Others perished in the terrible flight\r\nwhich ensued, hurling themselves over the precipices; but Ariobarzanes\r\nhimself, with a few horsemen, escaped into the mountains.[449]\r\n\r\nAlexander now marched back with all speed to the river, and finding\r\nthe bridge already constructed over it, he easily crossed with his\r\narmy.[450] Thence he again continued his march to Persepolis, so\r\nthat he arrived before the guards of the city could pillage the\r\ntreasury.[451] He also captured the money which was at Pasargadae[452]\r\nin the treasury of the first Cyrus, and appointed Phrasaortes, son\r\nof Rheomithres, viceroy over the Persians. He burnt down the Persian\r\npalace, though Parmenio advised him to preserve it, for many reasons,\r\nand especially because it was not well to destroy what was now his\r\nown property, and because the men of Asia would not by this course of\r\naction be induced to come over to him, thinking that he himself had\r\ndecided not to retain the rule of Asia, but only to conquer it and\r\ndepart. But Alexander said that he wished to take vengeance on the\r\nPersians, in retaliation for their deeds in the invasion of Greece,\r\nwhen they razed Athens to the ground and burnt down the temples. He\r\nalso desired to punish the Persians for all the other injuries they\r\nhad done the Greeks. But Alexander does not seem to me to have acted\r\non this occasion with prudence; nor do I think that this was any\r\nretributive penalty at all on the ancient Persians.[453]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nDARIUS PURSUED INTO MEDIA AND PARTHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter bringing these matters to a successful issue, he advanced towards\r\nMedia; for he ascertained that Darius was there. Now Darius had formed\r\nthe resolution, if Alexander remained at Susa or Babylon, to stay\r\nthere among the Medes, in order to see if any change of policy were\r\nmade by Alexander. But if the latter marched against him, he resolved\r\nto proceed into the interior towards Parthia and Hyrcania, as far\r\nas Bactria, laying waste all the land and making it impossible for\r\nAlexander to advance any further. He therefore sent the women and the\r\nrest of the property which he still retained, together with the covered\r\ncarriages, to what were called the Caspian Gates[454]; but he himself\r\nstayed at Ecbatana,[455] with the forces which had been collected\r\nfrom those who were at hand. Hearing this, Alexander advanced towards\r\nMedia, and invading the land of the Paraetacae,[456] he subdued it, and\r\nappointed Oxathres, son of Abulites, the former viceroy of Susa, to\r\nrule as viceroy. Being informed on the march that Darius had determined\r\nto meet him for battle, and to try the fortune of war again (for the\r\nScythians and Cadusians had come to him as allies), he ordered that the\r\nbeasts of burden, with their guards and the rest of the baggage, should\r\nfollow; and taking the rest of his army, he led it in order of battle,\r\nand on the twelfth day arrived in Media. There he ascertained that the\r\nforces of Darius were not fit for battle, and that his allies, the\r\nCadusians and Scythians, had not arrived; but that he had resolved to\r\nflee. He therefore marched on with still greater speed; and when he was\r\nonly three days’ journey from Ecbatana, he was met by Bistanes, son of\r\nOchus, who reigned over the Persians before Darius. This man announced\r\nthat Darius had fled five days before, taking with him 7,000 talents\r\nof money[457] from the Medes, and an army of 3,000 cavalry and 6,000\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander reached Ecbatana, he sent the Thessalian cavalry and\r\nthe other Grecian allies back to the sea, paying them the full hire\r\nwhich had been stipulated, and making them an additional donation from\r\nhimself of 2,000 talents. He issued an order that if any man of his\r\nown accord wished still to continue to serve for hire with him, he\r\nshould enlist; and those who enlisted in his service were not a few.\r\nHe then ordered Epocillus, son of Polyeides, to conduct the rest\r\ndown to the sea, taking other cavalry as a guard for them, since the\r\nThessalians sold their horses there. He also sent word to Menes to take\r\nupon himself the duty of seeing that they were conveyed in triremes to\r\nEuboea, when they arrived at the sea.[458] He instructed Parmenio to\r\ndeposit the money which was being conveyed from Persis in the citadel\r\nat Ecbatana, and to hand it over to the charge of Harpalus;[459] for\r\nhe had left this man over the money with a guard of 6,000 Macedonians\r\nand a few horsemen and light-armed infantry to take care of it. He told\r\nParmenio himself to take the Grecian mercenaries, the Thracians, and\r\nall the other horsemen except the Companion cavalry, and march by the\r\nland of the Cadusians into Hyrcania. He also sent word to Clitus, the\r\ncommander of the royal squadron of cavalry, who had been left behind at\r\nSusa ill, that when he arrived at Ecbatana from Susa he should take the\r\nMacedonians who had been left there in charge of the money, and go in\r\nthe direction of Parthia, where also he himself intended soon to arrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMARCH THROUGH THE CASPIAN GATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen taking the Companion cavalry, the light cavalry used for\r\nskirmishing, the Greek mercenary cavalry, under the command of\r\nErigyius, the Macedonian phalanx, except the men who had been placed\r\nin charge of the money, the archers, and the Agrianians, he marched\r\nagainst Darius. In the forced march which he made, many of his soldiers\r\nwere left behind, worn out with fatigue, and many of the horses\r\ndied. He nevertheless pressed on, and on the eleventh day arrived at\r\nRhagae.[460] This place is distant from the Caspian Gates one day’s\r\njourney to one marching as Alexander did. But Darius had already passed\r\nthrough this defile before Alexander came up, though many of those who\r\nwere his companions in flight deserted him on the way and retired to\r\ntheir own abodes. Many also surrendered to Alexander. The latter now\r\ngave up the hope of capturing Darius by close pursuit, and remained\r\nthere five days to give his troops repose. He appointed Oxodates a\r\nPersian, who had the ill fortune to be arrested by Darius and shut up\r\nat Susa, to the office of viceroy of Media; for this treatment was\r\nan inducement to Alexander to rely on his fidelity. He then marched\r\ntowards Parthia; and on the first day encamped near the Caspian Gates,\r\nwhich he passed through on the second day as far as the country was\r\ninhabited.[461] Hearing that the country further on was desert, he\r\nresolved to procure a stock of provisions from the place where he was\r\nencamped, and accordingly sent Coenus out on a foraging expedition with\r\nthe cavalry and a small body of infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nDARIUS IS ASSASSINATED BY BESSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Bagistanes, one of the Babylonian nobles, came to him\r\nfrom the camp of Darius, accompanied by Antibelus, one of the sons of\r\nMazaeus. These men informed him that Nabarzanes, the commander of the\r\ncavalry which accompanied Darius in his flight, Bessus, viceroy of\r\nBactria, and Barsaëntes, viceroy of the Arachotians and Drangians,[462]\r\nhad jointly arrested the king. When Alexander heard this, he marched\r\nwith still greater speed than ever, taking with him only the Companions\r\nand the skirmishing cavalry, as well as some of the foot-soldiers\r\nselected as the strongest and lightest men. He did not even wait for\r\nCoenus to return from the foraging expedition; but placed Craterus over\r\nthe men left behind, with instructions to follow in short marches.\r\nHis own men took with them nothing but their arms and provisions for\r\ntwo days. After marching the whole night and till noon of the next\r\nday, he gave his army a short rest, then went on again all night, and\r\nwhen day began to break reached the camp from which Bagistanes had set\r\nout to meet him; but he did not catch the enemy. However, in regard\r\nto Darius, he ascertained that he had been arrested and was being\r\nconveyed in a covered carriage[463]; that Bessus possessed the command\r\ninstead of Darius, and had been nominated leader by the Bactrian\r\ncavalry and all the other barbarians who were companions of Darius in\r\nhis flight, except Artabazus and his sons, together with the Grecian\r\nmercenaries, who still remained faithful to Darius; but they, not being\r\nable to prevent what was being done, had turned aside their march\r\nfrom the public thoroughfare and were marching towards the mountains\r\nby themselves, refusing to take part with Bessus and his adherents in\r\ntheir enterprise. He also learnt that those who had arrested Darius had\r\ncome to the decision to surrender him to Alexander, and to procure\r\nsome advantage for themselves, if they should find that Alexander was\r\npursuing them; but if they should learn that he had gone back again,\r\nthey had resolved to collect as large an army as they could and to\r\npreserve the rule for the commonwealth. He also ascertained that for\r\nthe present Bessus held the supreme command, both on account of his\r\nrelationship to Darius and because the war was being carried on in his\r\nviceregal province. Hearing this, Alexander thought it was advisable\r\nto pursue with all his might; and though his men and horses were\r\nalready quite fatigued by the incessant severity of their labours, he\r\nnevertheless proceeded, and, travelling a long way all through the\r\nnight and the next day till noon, arrived at a certain village, where\r\nthose who were leading Darius had encamped the day before. Hearing\r\nthere that the barbarians had decided to continue their march by\r\nnight, he inquired of the natives if they knew any shorter road to\r\nthe fugitives. They said they did know one, but that it ran through a\r\ncountry which was desert through lack of water. He nevertheless ordered\r\nthem to show him this way, and perceiving that the infantry could not\r\nkeep up with him if he marched at full speed, he caused 500 of the\r\ncavalry to dismount from their horses; and selecting the officers of\r\nthe infantry and the best of the other foot-soldiers, he ordered them\r\nto mount the horses armed just as they were. He also directed Nicanor,\r\nthe commander of the shield-bearing guards, and Attalus, commander\r\nof the Agrianians, to lead their men who were left behind, by the\r\nsame route which Bessus had taken, having equipped them as lightly as\r\npossible; and he ordered that the rest of the infantry should follow in\r\nregular marching order. He himself began to march in the afternoon, and\r\nled the way with great rapidity.[464]\r\n\r\nHaving travelled 400 stades in the night, he came upon the barbarians\r\njust before daybreak, going along without any order and unarmed; so\r\nthat few of them rushed to defend themselves, but most of them, as soon\r\nas they saw Alexander himself, took to flight without even coming to\r\nblows. A few of those who turned to resist being killed, the rest of\r\nthese also took to flight. Up to this time Bessus and his adherents\r\nwere still conveying Darius with them in a covered carriage; but when\r\nAlexander was already close upon their heels Nabarzanes and Barsaëntes\r\nwounded him and left him there, and with 600 horsemen took to flight.\r\nDarius died from his wounds soon after, before Alexander had seen\r\nhim.[465]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS ON THE FATE OF DARIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander sent the body of Darius into Persis, with orders that it\r\nshould be buried in the royal sepulchre, in the same way as the other\r\nPersian kings before him had been buried.[466] He then proclaimed\r\nAmminaspes, a Parthian, viceroy over the Parthians and Hyrcanians.\r\nThis man was one of those who with Mazaces had surrendered Egypt to\r\nAlexander. He also appointed Tlepolemus, son of Pythophanes, one of the\r\nCompanions, to guard his interests in Parthia and Hyrcania. Such was\r\nthe end of Darius, in the archonship of Aristophon at Athens, in the\r\nmonth Hecatombaion.[467] This king was a man pre-eminently effeminate\r\nand lacking in self-reliance in military enterprises; but as to civil\r\nmatters he never exhibited any disposition to indulge in arbitrary\r\nconduct; nor indeed was it in his power to exhibit it. For it happened\r\nthat he was involved in a war with the Macedonians and Greeks at the\r\nvery time he succeeded to the regal power[468]; and consequently it\r\nwas no longer possible for him to act the tyrant towards his subjects,\r\neven if he had been so inclined, standing as he did in greater danger\r\nthan they. As long as he lived, one misfortune after another was\r\naccumulated upon him; nor did he experience any cessation of calamity\r\nfrom the time when he first succeeded to the rule. At the beginning\r\nof his reign the cavalry defeat was sustained by his viceroys at the\r\nGranicus, and forthwith Ionia Aeolis, both the Phrygias, Lydia, and\r\nall Caria[469] except Halicarnassus were occupied by his foe; soon\r\nafter, Halicarnassus also was captured, as well as all the littoral as\r\nfar as Cilicia. Then came his own discomfiture at Issus, where he saw\r\nhis mother, wife, and children taken prisoners. Upon this Phoenicia\r\nand the whole of Egypt were lost; and then at Arbela he himself fled\r\ndisgracefully among the first, and lost a very vast army composed\r\nof all the nations of his empire. After this, wandering as an exile\r\nfrom his own dominions, he died after being betrayed by his personal\r\nattendants to the worst treatment possible, being at the same time king\r\nand a prisoner ignominiously led in chains; and at last he perished\r\nthrough a conspiracy formed of those most intimately acquainted with\r\nhim. Such were the misfortunes that befell Darius in his lifetime; but\r\nafter his death he received a royal burial; his children received from\r\nAlexander a princely rearing and education, just as if their father had\r\nstill been king; and Alexander himself became his son-in-law.[470] When\r\nhe died he was about fifty years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION INTO HYRCANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander now took the soldiers who had been left behind in his pursuit\r\nand advanced into Hyrcania,[471] which is the country lying on the\r\nleft of the road leading to Bactra.[472] On one side it is bounded\r\nby lofty mountains densely covered with wood, and on the other it is\r\na plain stretching as far as the Great Sea[473] in this part of the\r\nworld. He led his army by this route, because he ascertained that the\r\nGrecian mercenaries serving under Darius had succeeded in escaping\r\nby it into the mountains of Tapuria; at the same time he resolved to\r\nsubdue the Tapurians themselves. Having divided his army into three\r\nparts, he himself led the way by the shortest and most difficult route,\r\nat the head of the most numerous and at the same time the lightest\r\ndivision of his forces. He despatched Craterus at the head of his own\r\nbrigade and that of Amyntas, some of the archers, and a few of the\r\ncavalry against the Tapurians; and he ordered Erigyius to take the\r\nGrecian mercenaries and the rest of the cavalry, and lead the way by\r\nthe public thoroughfare, though it was longer, conducting the waggons,\r\nthe baggage, and the crowd of camp-followers. After crossing the first\r\nmountains, and encamping there, he took the shield-bearing guards\r\ntogether with the lightest men in the Macedonian phalanx and some of\r\nthe archers, and went along a road difficult and hard to travel upon,\r\nleaving guards for the roads wherever he thought there was any peril,\r\nso that the barbarians who held the mountains might not at those points\r\nfall upon the men who were following. Having passed through the defiles\r\nwith his archers, he encamped in the plain near a small river[474];\r\nand while he was here, Nabarzanes, the commander of Darius’s cavalry,\r\nPhrataphernes, the viceroy of Hyrcania and Parthia, and the other most\r\ndistinguished of the Persians in attendance on Darius, arrived and\r\nsurrendered themselves. After waiting four days in the camp, he took\r\nup those who had been left behind on the march, all of them advancing\r\nin safety except the Agrianians, who, while guarding the rear, were\r\nattacked by the barbarian mountaineers. But these soon drew off when\r\nthey got the worst of it in the skirmish. Starting from this place,\r\nhe advanced into Hyrcania as far as Zadracarta, the capital of the\r\nHyrcanians. In this place[475] he was rejoined by Craterus, who had\r\nnot succeeded in falling in with the Grecian mercenaries of Darius;\r\nbut he had thoroughly traversed the whole country, gaining over part\r\nof it by force and the other part by the voluntary capitulation of the\r\ninhabitants. Erigyius also arrived here with the baggage and waggons;\r\nand soon after Artabazus[476] came to Alexander with three of his\r\nsons, Cophen, Ariobarzanes, and Arsames, accompanied by Autophradates,\r\nviceroy of Tapuria, and envoys from the Grecian mercenaries in the\r\nservice of Darius. To Autophradates he restored his viceregal office;\r\nbut Artabazus and his sons he kept near himself in a position of\r\nhonour, both on account of their fidelity to Darius and because they\r\nwere among the first nobles of Persia. To the envoys from the Greeks,\r\nbegging him to make a truce with them on behalf of the whole mercenary\r\nforce, he replied that he would not make any agreement with them;\r\nbecause they were acting with great guilt in serving as soldiers\r\non the side of the barbarians against Greece, in contravention of\r\nthe resolution of the Greeks. He commanded them to come in a body\r\nand surrender, leaving it to him to treat them as he pleased, or to\r\npreserve themselves as best they could. The envoys said that they\r\nyielded both themselves and their comrades to Alexander, and urged him\r\nto send some one with them to act as their leader, so that they might\r\nbe conducted to him with safety. They said they were 1,500 in number.\r\nAccordingly he sent Andronicus, son of Agerrhus, and Artabazus to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION AGAINST THE MARDIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then marched forward against the Mardians[477] taking with him the\r\nshield-bearing guards, the archers, the Agrianians, the brigades\r\nof Coenus and Amyntas, half of the Companion cavalry, and the\r\nhorse-lancers; for he had now a troop of horse-lancers. Traversing\r\nthe greater part of the land of the Mardians, he killed many of them\r\nin their flight, some indeed having turned to defend themselves; and\r\nmany were taken prisoners. No one for a long time had invaded their\r\nland in a hostile manner, not only on account of its ruggedness,\r\nbut also because the people were poor, and besides being poor were\r\nwarlike. Therefore they never feared that Alexander would attack them,\r\nespecially as he had already advanced further than their country. For\r\nthis reason they were caught more easily off their guard. Many of them,\r\nhowever, escaped into the mountains, which in their land are very lofty\r\nand craggy, thinking that Alexander would not penetrate to these at\r\nany rate. But when he was approaching them even here, they sent envoys\r\nto surrender both the people and their land to him. He pardoned them,\r\nand appointed Autophradates, whom he had also recently placed over the\r\nTapurians, viceroy over them. Returning to the camp, from which he\r\nhad started to invade the country of the Mardians, he found that the\r\nGrecian mercenaries of Darius had arrived, accompanied by the envoys\r\nfrom the Lacedaemonians who were on an embassy to king Darius. The\r\nnames of these men were, Callicratidas, Pausippus, Monimus, Onomas, and\r\nDropides, a man from Athens. These were arrested and kept under guard;\r\nbut he released the envoys from the Sinopeans,[478] because these\r\npeople had no share in the commonwealth of the Greeks; and as they were\r\nin subjection to the Persians, they did not seem to be doing anything\r\nunreasonable in going on an embassy to their own king. He also released\r\nthe rest of the Greeks who were serving for pay with the Persians\r\nbefore the peace and alliance which had been made by the Greeks with\r\nthe Macedonians. He likewise released Heraclides, the ambassador from\r\nthe Chalcedonians[479] to Darius. The rest he ordered to serve in his\r\narmy for the same pay as they had received from the Persian king,\r\nputting them under the command of Andronicus, who had led them, and had\r\nevidently been taking prudent measures to save the lives of the men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nMARCH TO BACTRA.—BESSUS AIDED BY SATIBARZANES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving settled these affairs, he marched to Zadracarta, the largest\r\ncity of Hyrcania, where also was the seat of the Hyrcanian government.\r\nTarrying here fifteen days, he offered sacrifice to the gods according\r\nto his custom, and celebrated a gymnastic contest, after which he began\r\nhis march towards Parthia; thence to the confines of Areia[480] and\r\nto Susia, a city in that province, where Satibarzanes, the viceroy of\r\nthe Areians, came to meet him. To this man he restored his viceregal\r\ndignity, and with him sent Anaxippus, one of the Companions, to whom\r\nhe gave forty horse-lancers so that he might be able to station them\r\nas guards of the localities, in order that the Areians might not be\r\ninjured by the army in its march through their land. At this time\r\ncame to him some Persians, who informed him that Bessus had assumed\r\nthe erect tiara[481] and was wearing the Persian dress,[482] calling\r\nhimself Artaxerxes instead of Bessus, and asserting that he was king\r\nof Asia. They said he had in attendance upon him the Persians who had\r\nescaped into Bactra and many of the Bactrians themselves; and that he\r\nwas expecting the Scythians also to come to him as allies. Alexander,\r\nhaving now all his forces together, went towards Bactra, where Philip\r\nson of Menelaüs came to him out of Media with the Greek mercenary\r\ncavalry which were under his own command, those of the Thessalians\r\nwho had volunteered to remain, and the men of Andromachus. Nicanor,\r\nthe son of Parmenio, the commander of the shield-bearing guards, had\r\nalready died of disease. While Alexander was on his way to Bactra, he\r\nwas informed that Satibarzanes, viceroy of Areia, had killed Anaxippus\r\nand the horse-lancers who were with him, had armed the Areians and\r\ncollected them in the city of Artacoana, which was the capital of\r\nthat nation. It was also said that he had resolved, as soon as he\r\nascertained that Alexander had advanced, to leave that place and go\r\nwith his forces to Bessus, with the intention of joining that prince\r\nin an attack upon the Macedonians, wherever a chance might occur. When\r\nhe received this news, he stopped the march towards Bactra, and taking\r\nwith him the Companion cavalry, the horse-lancers, the archers, the\r\nAgrianians and the regiments of Amyntas and Coenus, and leaving the\r\nrest of his forces there under the command of Craterus, he made a\r\nforced march against Satibarzanes and the Areians; and having travelled\r\n600 stades in two days came near Artacoana. Satibarzanes, however, no\r\nsooner perceived that Alexander was near, than being struck with terror\r\nat the quickness of his arrival, he took to flight with a few Areian\r\nhorsemen. For he was deserted by the majority of his soldiers in his\r\nflight, when they also learned that Alexander was at hand. The latter\r\nmade rapid marches in pursuit of the enemy, killed some of the men whom\r\nhe discovered to be guilty of the revolt and who at that time had left\r\ntheir villages, fleeing, some one way, some another; and others of them\r\nhe sold into slavery. He then proclaimed Arsames, a Persian, viceroy\r\nover the Areians. Being now joined by the men who had been left behind\r\nwith Craterus, he marched into the land of the Zarangaeans,[483] and\r\nreached the place where their seat of government was. But Barsaëntes,\r\nwho at that time had possession of the land, being one of those who\r\nhad fallen upon Darius in his flight, learning that Alexander was\r\napproaching, fled to the Indians who live this side of the river Indus.\r\nBut they arrested him and sent him back to Alexander, by whom he was\r\nput to death on account of his guilty conduct towards Darius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nPHILOTAS AND PARMENIO PUT TO DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere also Alexander discovered the conspiracy of Philōtas, son of\r\nParmenio. Ptolemy and Aristobūlus say that it had already been\r\nreported to him before in Egypt[484]; but that it did not appear to\r\nhim credible, both on account of the long-existing friendship between\r\nthem, the honour which he publicly conferred upon his father Parmenio,\r\nand the confidence he reposed in Philotas himself. Ptolemy, son of\r\nLagus, says that Philotas was brought before the Macedonians,[485] that\r\nAlexander vehemently accused him, and that he defended himself from the\r\ncharges. He says also that the divulgers[486] of the plot came forward\r\nand convicted him and his accomplices both by other clear proofs and\r\nespecially because Philotas himself confessed that he had heard of a\r\ncertain conspiracy which was being formed against Alexander. He was\r\nconvicted of having said nothing to the king about this plot, though he\r\nvisited the royal tent twice a day.[487] He and all the others who had\r\ntaken part with him in the conspiracy were killed by the Macedonians\r\nwith their javelins;[488] and Polydamas, one of the Companions, was\r\ndespatched to Parmenio, carrying letters from Alexander to the generals\r\nin Media, Cleander, Sitalces, and Menidas, who had been placed over the\r\narmy commanded by Parmenio. By these men Parmenio was put to death,\r\nperhaps because Alexander deemed it incredible that Philotas should\r\nconspire against him and Parmenio not participate in his son’s plan; or\r\nperhaps, he thought that even if he had no share in it, he would now\r\nbe a dangerous man if he survived, after the king had violently made\r\naway with his son. Moreover he was held in very great respect both by\r\nAlexander himself and by all the army, having great influence not only\r\namong the Macedonian troops but also among the Grecian auxiliaries,\r\nwhom he often used to command according to Alexander’s order, both in\r\nhis own turn and out of his turn, with his sovereign’s approbation and\r\nsatisfaction.[489]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF AMYNTAS.—THE ARIASPIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey also say that about the same time Amyntas, son of Andromenes,\r\nwas brought to trial, together with his brothers Polemo, Attalus, and\r\nSimmias, on the charge of being accessory to the conspiracy against\r\nAlexander, on account of their trust in Philotas and their intimate\r\nfriendship with him. The belief in their participation in the plot was\r\nstrengthened among the mass of men by the fact that when Philotas was\r\narrested, Polemo, one of the brothers of Amyntas, fled to the enemy.\r\nBut Amyntas with his other two brothers stayed to await the trial,\r\nand defended himself so vigorously among the Macedonians that he was\r\ndeclared innocent of the charge. As soon as he was acquitted in the\r\nassembly, he demanded that permission should be given him to go to\r\nhis brother and bring him back to Alexander. To this the Macedonians\r\nacceded; so he went away and on the same day brought Polemo back. On\r\nthis account he now seemed free from guilt much more than before. But\r\nsoon after, as he was besieging a certain village, he was shot with an\r\narrow and died of the wound; so that he derived no other advantage from\r\nhis acquittal except that of dying with an unsullied reputation.[490]\r\n\r\nAlexander appointed two commanders over the Companion cavalry,\r\nHephaestion, son of Amyntor, and Clitus, son of Dropidas, dividing\r\nthe brigade of the Companions into two parts, because he did not\r\nwish any one of his friends to have the sole command of so many\r\nhorsemen, especially as they were the best of all his cavalry, both\r\nin public estimation and in martial discipline.[491] He now arrived\r\nin the land of the people formerly called Ariaspians, but afterwards\r\nnamed Euergetae, because they assisted Cyrus, son of Cambyses, in\r\nhis invasion of Scythia.[492] Alexander treated these people, whose\r\nancestors had been serviceable to Cyrus, with honour; and when he\r\nascertained that the men not only enjoyed a form of government unlike\r\nthat of the other barbarians in that part of the world, but laid claim\r\nto justice equally with the best of the Greeks, he set them free, and\r\ngave them besides as much of the adjacent country as they asked for\r\nthemselves; but they did not ask for much. Here he offered sacrifice to\r\nApollo, and arrested Demetrius, one of his confidential body-guards, on\r\nsuspicion of having been implicated with Philotas in the conspiracy.\r\nPtolemy, son of Lagus, was appointed to the post vacated by Demetrius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER CROSSES THE HINDU-KOOSH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the transaction of this business, he advanced against Bactra and\r\nBessus, reducing the Drangians and Gadrosians[493] to subjection on his\r\nmarch. He also reduced the Arachotians to subjection and appointed\r\nMenon viceroy over them. He then reached the Indians, who inhabit\r\nthe land bordering on that of the Arachotians. All these nations he\r\nreached marching through deep snow and his soldiers experiencing\r\nscarcity of provisions and severe hardship. Learning that the Areians\r\nhad again revolted, in consequence of Satibarzanes invading their land\r\nwith 2,000 cavalry, which he had received from Bessus, he despatched\r\nagainst them Artabazus the Persian with Erigyius and Caranus two of the\r\nCompanions, also ordering Phrataphernes, viceroy of the Parthians, to\r\nassist them in attacking the Areians. An obstinately contested battle\r\nthen took place between the troops of Erigyius and Caranus and those\r\nof Satibarzanes; nor did the barbarians give way until Satibarzanes,\r\nencountering Erigyius, was struck in the face with a spear and killed.\r\nThen the barbarians gave way and fled with headlong speed.\r\n\r\nMeantime Alexander was leading his army towards Mount Caucasus,[494]\r\nwhere he founded a city and named it Alexandreia.[495] Having offered\r\nsacrifice here to the gods to whom it was his custom to sacrifice, he\r\ncrossed Mount Caucasus, after appointing Proëxes, a Persian, viceroy\r\nover the land, and leaving Neiloxenus son of Satyrus, one of the\r\nCompanions, with an army as superintendent. According to the account\r\nof Aristobulus, Mount Caucasus is as lofty as any in Asia, and most of\r\nit is bare, at any rate in that part where Alexander crossed it. This\r\nrange of mountains stretches out so far that they say even that Mount\r\nTaurus, which forms the boundary of Cilicia and Pamphylia, springs\r\nfrom it, as do other great ranges which have been distinguished from\r\nthe Caucasus by various names according to the position of each.\r\nAristobulus says that in this part of the Caucasus nothing grew except\r\nterebinth trees and silphium;[496] notwithstanding which, it was\r\ninhabited by many people, and many sheep and oxen graze there; because\r\nsheep are very fond of silphium. For if a sheep smells it even from a\r\ndistance, it runs to it and feeds upon the flower. They also dig up the\r\nroot, which is devoured by the sheep. For this reason in Cyrene,[497]\r\nsome drive their flocks as far as possible away from the places where\r\ntheir silphium is growing; others even enclose the place with a fence,\r\nso that even if the sheep should approach it they would not be able\r\nto get within the enclosure. For the silphium is very valuable to the\r\nCyrenaeans.\r\n\r\nBessus, accompanied by the Persians who had taken part with him in the\r\nseizure of Darius, and by 7,000 of the Bactrians themselves and the\r\nDaans who dwelt on this side the Tanais,[498] was laying waste the\r\ncountry at the foot of Mount Caucasus, in order to prevent Alexander\r\nfrom marching any further, both by the desolation of the land between\r\nthe enemy and himself and by the lack of provisions. But none the\r\nless did Alexander keep up the march, though with difficulty, both on\r\naccount of the deep snow and from the want of necessaries; but yet he\r\npersevered in his journey. When Bessus was informed that Alexander was\r\nnow not far off, he crossed the river Oxus,[499] and having burnt the\r\nboats upon which he had crossed, he withdrew to Nautaca[500] in the\r\nland of Sogdiana. He was followed by Spitamenes and Oxyartes, with the\r\ncavalry from Sogdiana, as well as by the Daans from the Tanais. But\r\nthe Bactrian cavalry, perceiving that Bessus had resolved to take to\r\nflight, all dispersed in various directions to their own abodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF BACTRIA, AND PURSUIT OF BESSUS ACROSS THE OXUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander now arrived at Drapsaca, and having there given his army a\r\nrest, he marched to Aornus and Bactra, which are the largest cities in\r\nthe land of the Bactrians. These he took at the first assault; and left\r\na garrison in the citadel of Aornus, over which he placed Archelaüs\r\nson of Androcles, one of the Companions. He appointed Artabazus the\r\nPersian, viceroy over the rest of the Bactrians, who were easily\r\nreduced to submission. Then he marched towards the river Oxus, which\r\nflows from mount Caucasus, and is the largest of all the rivers in Asia\r\nwhich Alexander and his army reached, except the Indian rivers; but the\r\nIndian rivers are the largest in the world. The Oxus discharges its\r\nwater into the great sea which is near Hyrcania. When he attempted to\r\ncross the river it appeared altogether impassable; for its breadth was\r\nabout six stades, and its depth was much greater than the proportion of\r\nits breadth. The bed of the river was sandy, and the stream so rapid,\r\nthat stakes fixed deep into the bottom were easily rooted up from\r\nthe earth by the mere force of the current, inasmuch as they could\r\nnot be securely fixed in the sand. Besides this, there was a scarcity\r\nof timber in the locality, and he thought it would take a long time\r\nand cause great delay, if they brought from a distance the materials\r\nneedful for making a bridge over the river. Therefore he collected the\r\nskins which the soldiers used for tent-coverings, and ordered them to\r\nbe filled with chaff as dry as possible, and tied and stitched tightly\r\ntogether, so that the water might not penetrate into them.[501] When\r\nthese were filled and stitched together, they were sufficient to convey\r\nthe army across in five days. But before he crossed the river, he\r\nselected the oldest of the Macedonians, who were now unfit for military\r\nservice, and such of the Thessalians as had volunteered to remain in\r\nthe army, and sent them back home. He then dispatched Stasanor, one\r\nof the Companions, into the land of the Areians, with instructions to\r\narrest Arsames, the viceroy of that people, because he thought him\r\ndisaffected, and to assume the office of viceroy of Areia himself.\r\n\r\nAfter passing over the river Oxus, he made a forced march to the place\r\nwhere he heard that Bessus was with his forces; but at this time\r\nmessengers reached him from Spitamenes and Dataphernes, to announce\r\nthat they would arrest Bessus and hand him over to Alexander if he\r\nwould send to them a small army and a commander for it; since even at\r\nthat very time they were holding him under guard, though they had not\r\nbound him with fetters. When Alexander heard this, he gave his army\r\nrest, and marched more slowly than before. But he despatched Ptolemy,\r\nson of Lagus, at the head of three troops of the Companion cavalry and\r\nall the horse-lancers, and of the infantry, the brigade of Philotas,\r\none regiment of 1,000 shield-bearing guards, all the Agrianians, and\r\nhalf the archers, with orders to make a forced march to Spitamenes\r\nand Dataphernes. Ptolemy went according to his instructions, and\r\ncompleting ten days’ march in four days, arrived at the camp where on\r\nthe preceding day the barbarians under Spitamenes had bivouacked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF BESSUS.—EXPLOITS IN SOGDIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere Ptolemy learned that Spitamenes and Dataphernes were not firmly\r\nresolved about the betrayal of Bessus. He therefore left the infantry\r\nbehind with orders to follow him in regular order, and advanced with\r\nthe cavalry till he arrived at a certain village, where Bessus was\r\nwith a few soldiers; for Spitamenes and his party had already retired\r\nfrom thence, being ashamed to betray Bessus themselves. Ptolemy posted\r\nhis cavalry right round the village, which was enclosed by a wall\r\nsupplied with gates. He then issued a proclamation to the barbarians\r\nin the village, that they would be allowed to depart uninjured if they\r\nsurrendered Bessus to him. They accordingly admitted Ptolemy and his\r\nmen into the village. He then seized Bessus and departed; but sent a\r\nmessenger on before to ask Alexander how he was to conduct Bessus into\r\nhis presence. Alexander ordered him to bind the prisoner naked in a\r\nwooden collar, and thus to lead him and place him on the right-hand\r\nside of the road along which he was about to march with the army. Thus\r\ndid Ptolemy. When Alexander saw Bessus, he caused his chariot to stop,\r\nand asked him, for what reason he had in the first place arrested\r\nDarius, his own king, who was also his kinsman and benefactor, and\r\nthen led him as a prisoner in chains, and at last killed him? Bessus\r\nsaid that he was not the only person who had decided to do this, but\r\nthat it was the joint act of those who were at the time in attendance\r\nupon Darius, with the view of procuring safety for themselves from\r\nAlexander. For this Alexander ordered that he should be scourged, and\r\nthat the herald should repeat the very same reproaches which he had\r\nhimself made to Bessus in his inquiry. After being thus disgracefully\r\ntortured, he was sent away to Bactria to be put to death. Such is the\r\naccount given by Ptolemy in relation to Bessus; but Aristobulus says\r\nthat Spitamenes and Dataphernes brought Bessus to Ptolemy, and having\r\nbound him naked in a wooden collar betrayed him to Alexander.[502]\r\n\r\nAlexander supplied his cavalry with horses from that district, for many\r\nof his own horses had perished in the passage of the Caucasus and in\r\nthe march to and from the Oxus. He then led his army to Maracanda,[503]\r\nwhich is the capital of the land of the Sogdianians. Thence he\r\nadvanced to the river Tanais. This river, which Aristobulus says the\r\nneighbouring barbarians call by a different name, Jaxartes, has its\r\nsource, like the Oxus, in mount Caucasus, and also discharges itself\r\ninto the Hyrcanian Sea.[504] It must be a different Tanais from that\r\nof which Herodotus the historian speaks, saying that it is the eighth\r\nof the Scythian rivers, that it flows out of a great lake in which it\r\noriginates, and discharges itself into a still larger lake, called\r\nthe Maeotis.[505] There are some who make this Tanais the boundary\r\nof Europe and Asia, saying that the Palus Maeotis, issuing from the\r\nfurthest recess of the Euxine[506] Sea, and this river Tanais, which\r\ndischarges itself into the Maeotis, separate Asia and Europe,[507]\r\njust in the same way as the sea near Gadeira and the Nomad Libyans\r\nopposite Gadeira separates Libya and Europe.[508] Libya also is said\r\nby these men to be divided from the rest of Asia by the river Nile.\r\nIn this place (viz. at the river Tanais), some of the Macedonians,\r\nbeing engaged in foraging, were cut to pieces by the barbarians.\r\nThe perpetrators of this deed escaped to a mountain, which was very\r\nrugged and precipitous on all sides. In number they were about 30,000.\r\nAlexander took the lightest men in his army and marched against these.\r\nThen the Macedonians made many ineffectual assaults upon the mountain.\r\nAt first they were beaten back by the missiles of the barbarians, and\r\nmany of them were wounded, including Alexander himself, who was shot\r\nright through the leg with an arrow, and the fibula of his leg was\r\nbroken. Notwithstanding this, he captured the place, and some of the\r\nbarbarians were cut to pieces there by the Macedonians, while many\r\nalso cast themselves down from the rocks and perished; so that out of\r\n30,000 not more than 8,000 were preserved.[509]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nREBELLION OF THE SOGDIANIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after this, envoys reached Alexander from the people called\r\nAbian Scythians, whom Homer commended in his poem, calling them the\r\njustest of men.[510] This nation dwells in Asia and is independent,\r\nchiefly by reason of its poverty and love of justice. Envoys also came\r\nfrom the Scythians of Europe, who are the largest nation dwelling\r\nin that continent.[511] Alexander sent some of the Companions with\r\nthem, under the pretext indeed that they were to conclude a friendly\r\nalliance by the embassy; but the real object of the mission was rather\r\nto spy into the natural features of the Scythian land, the number of\r\nthe inhabitants and their customs, as well as the armaments which they\r\npossessed for making military expeditions.[512] He formed a plan of\r\nfounding a city near the river Tanais, which was to be named after\r\nhimself; for the site seemed to him suitable and likely to cause the\r\ncity to grow to large dimensions. He also thought it would be built\r\nin a place which would serve as a favourable basis of operations for\r\nan invasion of Scythia, if such an event should ever occur; and not\r\nonly so, but it would also be a bulwark to secure the land against the\r\nincursions of the barbarians dwelling on the further side of the river.\r\nMoreover he thought that the city would become great, both by reason of\r\nthe multitude of those who would join in colonizing it, and on account\r\nof the celebrity of the name conferred upon it.[513] Meantime the\r\nbarbarians dwelling near the river seized upon the Macedonian soldiers\r\nwho were garrisoning their cities and killed them; after which they\r\nbegan to strengthen the cities for their greater security. Most of the\r\nSogdianians joined them in this revolt, being urged on to it by the men\r\nwho had arrested Bessus. These men were so energetic that they even\r\ninduced some of the Bactrians to join in the rebellion, either because\r\nthey were afraid of Alexander, or because their seducers assigned as a\r\nreason for their revolt, that he had sent instructions to the rulers\r\nof that land to assemble for a conference at Zariaspa, the chief city;\r\nwhich conference, they said, would be for no good purpose.[514]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF FIVE CITIES IN TWO DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander was informed of this, he gave instructions to the\r\ninfantry, company by company, to prepare the ladders which were\r\nassigned to each company. He then started from the camp and advanced\r\nto the nearest city, the name of which was Gaza; for the barbarians\r\nof the land were said to have fled for refuge into seven cities. He\r\nsent Craterus to the one called Cyropolis, the largest of them all,\r\ninto which most of the barbarians had gathered.[515] The orders of\r\nCraterus were to encamp near the city, to dig a trench round it, to\r\nsurround it with a stockade, and to fix together the military engines\r\nwhich were required for use, so that the men in this city, having had\r\ntheir attention drawn to his forces, might be unable to render aid to\r\nthe other cities. As soon as Alexander arrived at Gaza, without any\r\ndelay he gave the signal to his men to place the ladders against the\r\nwall all round and to take it by assault at once, as it was made merely\r\nof earth and was not at all high. Simultaneously with the assault of\r\nthe infantry, his slingers, archers, and javelin-throwers assailed\r\nthe defenders on the wall, and missiles were hurled from the military\r\nengines, so that the wall was quickly cleared of its defenders by the\r\nmultitude of the missiles. Then the fixing of the ladders against the\r\nwall and the mounting of the Macedonians were matters soon effected.\r\nThey killed all the men, according to Alexander’s injunctions; but\r\nthe women, the children, and the rest of the booty they carried off\r\nas plunder. Thence he immediately marched to the city situated next\r\nto that one; and this he took in the same way and on the same day,\r\ntreating the captives in the same manner. Then he marched against the\r\nthird city, and took it on the next day at the first assault. While\r\nhe was thus occupied by these matters with the infantry, he sent out\r\nhis cavalry to the two neighbouring cities, with orders to guard the\r\nmen within them closely, so that when they heard of the capture of the\r\nneighbouring cities, and at the same time of his own near approach,\r\nthey should not betake themselves to flight and render it impossible\r\nfor him to pursue them. It turned out just as he had conjectured; and\r\nhis despatch of the cavalry was made just at the nick of time. For\r\nwhen the barbarians who occupied the two cities still uncaptured,\r\nsaw the smoke rising from the city in front of them which was then\r\non fire, (and some men, escaping even from the midst of the calamity\r\nitself, became the reporters of the capture which they had themselves\r\nwitnessed,) they began to flee in crowds out of the cities as fast as\r\neach man could; but falling in with the dense body of cavalry drawn up\r\nin array of battle, most of them were cut to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSTORMING OF CYROPOLIS.—REVOLT OF THE SCYTHIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus captured the five cities and reduced them to slavery in two\r\ndays,[516] he went to Cyropolis, the largest city in the country. It\r\nwas fortified with a wall higher than those of the others, as it had\r\nbeen founded by Cyrus. The majority of the barbarians of this district,\r\nand at the same time the most warlike of them, had fled for refuge\r\nthither, and consequently it was not possible for the Macedonians\r\nto capture it so easily at the first assault. Wherefore Alexander\r\nbrought his military engines up to the wall with the determination\r\nof battering it down in this way, and of making assaults wherever\r\nbreaches might be made in it. When he observed that the channel of the\r\nriver, which flows through the city when it is swollen by the winter\r\nrains, was at that time nearly dry and did not reach up to the wall,\r\nand would thus afford his soldiers a passage by which to penetrate\r\ninto the city, he took the body-guards, the shield-bearing guards,\r\nthe archers, and Agrianians, and made his way secretly into the city\r\nalong the channel, at first with a few men, while the barbarians had\r\nturned their attention towards the military engines and those who were\r\nassailing them in that quarter. Having from within broken open the\r\ngates which were opposite this position, he gave an easy admittance to\r\nthe rest of his soldiers. Then the barbarians, though they perceived\r\nthat their city was already in the hands of the enemy, nevertheless\r\nturned against Alexander and his men and made a desperate assault upon\r\nthem, in which Alexander himself received a violent blow on the head\r\nand neck with a stone, and Craterus was wounded with an arrow, as were\r\nalso many other officers. Notwithstanding this, however, they drove\r\nthe barbarians out of the market-place. Meantime, those who had made\r\nthe assault upon the wall, took it, as it was now void of defenders.\r\nIn the first capture of the city about 8,000 of the enemy were killed.\r\nThe rest fled for refuge into the citadel; for 15,000 warriors in all\r\nhad gathered together in the city. Alexander encamped around these\r\nand besieged them for one day,[517] and then they surrendered through\r\nlack of water. The seventh city he took at the first assault. Ptolemy\r\nsays that the men in it surrendered; but Aristobulus asserts that this\r\ncity was also taken by storm, and that he slew all who were captured\r\ntherein. Ptolemy also says that he distributed the men among the army\r\nand ordered that they should be kept guarded in chains until he should\r\ndepart from the country, so that none of those who had effected the\r\nrevolt should be left behind. Meantime an army of the Asiatic Scythians\r\narrived at the bank of the river Tanais, because most of them had heard\r\nthat some of the barbarians on the opposite side of the river had\r\nrevolted from Alexander. They intended to attack the Macedonians, if\r\nany revolutionary movement worthy of consideration were effected. News\r\nwas also brought that Spitamenes was besieging the men who had been\r\nleft in the citadel at Maracanda. Against him Alexander then despatched\r\nAndromachus, Menedemus, and Caranus with sixty of the Companion\r\ncavalry, 800 of the mercenary cavalry under the command of Caranus,\r\nand 1,500 mercenary infantry. Over them he placed Pharnuches the\r\ninterpreter, who, though by birth a Lycian, was skilled in the language\r\nof the barbarians of this country, and in other respects appeared\r\nclever in dealing with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF THE SCYTHIANS BEYOND THE TANAIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn twenty days he fortified the city which he was projecting, and\r\nsettled in it some of the Grecian mercenaries and those of the\r\nneighbouring barbarians who volunteered to take part in the settlement,\r\nas well as the Macedonians from his army who were now unfit for\r\nmilitary service.[518] He then offered sacrifice to the gods in his\r\ncustomary manner and celebrated an equestrian and gymnastic contest.\r\nWhen he saw that the Scythians were not retiring from the river’s bank,\r\nbut were seen to be shooting arrows into the river, which was not wide\r\nhere, and were uttering audacious words in their barbaric tongue to\r\ninsult Alexander, to the effect that he durst not touch Scythians, or\r\nif he did, he would learn what was the difference between them and\r\nthe Asiatic barbarians, he was irritated by these remarks, and having\r\nresolved to cross over against them, he began to prepare the skins for\r\nthe passage of the river.[519] But when he offered sacrifice with a\r\nview to crossing, the victims proved to be unfavourable; and though he\r\nwas vexed at this, he nevertheless controlled himself and remained\r\nwhere he was. But as the Scythians did not desist from their insults,\r\nhe again offered sacrifice with a view to crossing; and Aristander told\r\nhim that the omens still portended danger to himself. But Alexander\r\nsaid that it was better for him to come into extreme danger than\r\nthat, after having subdued almost the whole of Asia, he should be a\r\nlaughing-stock to the Scythians, as Darius, the father of Xerxes, had\r\nbeen in days of yore.[520] Aristander refused to explain the will of\r\nthe gods contrary to the revelations made by the deity simply because\r\nAlexander wished to hear the contrary. When the skins had been prepared\r\nfor the passage, and the army, fully equipped, had been posted near\r\nthe river, the military engines, at the signal pre-concerted, began to\r\nshoot at the Scythians riding along the river’s bank. Some of them\r\nwere wounded by the missiles, and one was struck right through the\r\nwicker-shield and breastplate and fell from his horse. The others,\r\nbeing alarmed at the discharge of missiles from so great a distance,\r\nand at the death of their champion, retreated a little from the bank.\r\nBut Alexander, seeing them thrown into confusion by the effect of his\r\nmissiles, began to cross the river with trumpets sounding, himself\r\nleading the way; and the rest of the army followed him. Having first\r\ngot the archers and slingers across, he ordered them to sling and shoot\r\nat the Scythians, to prevent them approaching the phalanx of infantry\r\nstepping out of the water, until all his cavalry had passed over. When\r\nthey were upon the bank in dense mass, he first of all launched against\r\nthe Scythians one regiment of the Grecian auxiliary cavalry and four\r\nsquadrons of pike-men. These the Scythians received, and in great\r\nnumbers riding round them in circles, wounded them, as they were few in\r\nnumber, themselves escaping with ease. But Alexander mixed the archers,\r\nthe Agrianians, and other light troops under the command of Balacrus,\r\nwith the cavalry, and then led them against the enemy. As soon as they\r\ncame to close quarters, he ordered three regiments of the cavalry\r\nCompanions and all the horse-lancers to charge them. The rest of the\r\ncavalry he himself led, and made a rapid attack with his squadrons\r\nin column. Accordingly the enemy were no longer able as before to\r\nwheel their cavalry force round in circles, for at one and the same\r\ntime the cavalry and the light-armed infantry mixed with the horsemen\r\npressed upon them, and did not permit them to wheel about in safety.\r\nThen the flight of the Scythians was already apparent. 1,000 of them\r\nfell, including Satraces, one of their chiefs; and 150 were captured.\r\nBut as the pursuit was keen and fatiguing on account of the excessive\r\nheat, the entire army was seized with thirst; and Alexander himself\r\nwhile riding drank of such water as was procurable in that country. He\r\nwas seized with an incessant diarrhœa; for the water was bad; and for\r\nthis reason he could not pursue all the Scythians. Otherwise I think\r\nall of them would have perished in the flight, if Alexander had not\r\nfallen ill. He was carried back to the camp, having fallen into extreme\r\ndanger; and thus Aristander’s prophecy was fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSPITAMENES DESTROYS A MACEDONIAN DETACHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after this, arrived envoys from the king of the Scythians, who\r\nwere sent to apologize for what had been done, and to state that it was\r\nnot the act of the Scythian State, but of certain men who set out for\r\nplunder after the manner of freebooters. They also assured him that\r\ntheir king was willing to obey the commands laid upon him. Alexander\r\nsent to him a courteous reply, because it did not seem honourable\r\nfor him to abstain from marching against him if he distrusted him,\r\nand at that time there was not an convenient opportunity to do so.\r\nThe Macedonians who were garrisoning the citadel at Maracanda, when\r\nan assault was made upon it by Spitamenes and his adherents, sallied\r\nforth, and killing some of the enemy and repulsing all the rest,\r\nretreated into the citadel without any loss. But when Spitamenes was\r\ninformed that the men despatched by Alexander to Maracanda were now\r\ndrawing near, he raised the siege of the citadel, and retired to the\r\ncapital of Sogdiana.[521] Pharnuches and the generals with him, being\r\neager to drive him out altogether, followed him up as he was retreating\r\ntowards the frontiers of Sogdiana, and without due consideration made a\r\njoint attack upon the Nomad Scythians. Then Spitamenes, having received\r\na reinforcement of 600 Scythian horsemen, was further emboldened by\r\nthe Scythian alliance to wait and receive the Macedonians who were\r\nadvancing upon him. Posting his men in a level place near the Scythian\r\ndesert, he was not willing either to wait for the enemy or to attack\r\nthem himself; but rode round and discharged arrows at the phalanx\r\nof infantry. When the forces of Pharnuches made a charge upon them,\r\nthey easily escaped, since at that time their horses were swifter\r\nand more vigorous, while the horse of Andromachus had been damaged\r\nby the incessant marching, as well as by lack of fodder; and the\r\nScythians pressed upon them with all their might whether they halted\r\nor retreated. Many of them then were wounded by the arrows, and some\r\nwere killed. They therefore arranged the soldiers into the form of a\r\nsquare and proceeded to the river Polytimetus,[522] because there was\r\na woody glen near it, and it would consequently no longer be easy for\r\nthe barbarians to shoot arrows at them, and their infantry would be\r\nmore useful to them. But Caranus, the commander of the cavalry, without\r\ncommunicating with Andromachus, attempted to cross the river in order\r\nto put the cavalry in a place of safety on the other side. The infantry\r\nfollowed him without any word of command; their descent into the river\r\nbeing made in a panic and without any discipline down the precipitous\r\nbanks. When the barbarians perceived the error of the Macedonians,\r\nthey sprang into the ford here and there, horses and all. Some of them\r\nseized and held tight those who had already crossed and were departing;\r\nothers being posted right in front of those who were crossing, rolled\r\nthem over into the river; others shot arrows at them from the flanks;\r\nwhile others pressed upon the men who were just entering the water. The\r\nMacedonians being thus encompassed with difficulty on all sides, fled\r\nfor refuge into one of the small islands in the river, where they were\r\nentirely surrounded by the Scythians and the cavalry of Spitamenes,\r\nand all killed with arrows, except a few of them, whom they reduced to\r\nslavery. All of these were afterwards killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSPITAMENES DRIVEN INTO THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Aristobulus says the greater part of this army was destroyed by an\r\nambuscade, the Scythians having hidden themselves in a park and fallen\r\nupon the Macedonians from their place of concealment, when Pharnuches\r\nwas in the very act of retiring from the command in favour of the\r\nMacedonians who had been sent with him, on the ground of his not being\r\nskilled in military affairs, and of his having been sent by Alexander\r\nrather to win the favour of the barbarians than to take the supreme\r\ncommand in battles. He also alleged that the Macedonian officers\r\npresent were the king’s Companions. But Andromachus, Menedemus, and\r\nCaranus declined to accept the chief command, partly because it did\r\nnot seem right to make any alteration on their own responsibility\r\ncontrary to Alexander’s instructions to them, and partly because in\r\nthe very crisis of danger, they were unwilling, if they met with any\r\ndefeat, not only individually to take a share of the blame, but also\r\ncollectively to exercise the command unsuccessfully. In this confusion\r\nand disorder the barbarians fell upon them, and cut them all off,\r\nso that not more than forty horsemen and 300 foot preserved their\r\nlives.[523] When the report of this reached Alexander, he was chagrined\r\nat the loss of his soldiers, and resolved to march with all speed\r\nagainst Spitamenes and his barbarian adherents. He therefore took half\r\nof the Companion cavalry, all the shield-bearing guards, the archers,\r\nthe Agrianians, and the lightest men of the phalanx, and went towards\r\nMaracanda, where he ascertained Spitamenes had returned and was again\r\nbesieging the men in the citadel. Having travelled 1,500 stades in\r\nthree days, at the approach of dawn on the fourth day he came near the\r\ncity;[524] but when Spitamenes was informed of Alexander’s approach,\r\nhe did not remain, but abandoned the city and fled. Alexander pursued\r\nhim closely; and coming to the place where the battle was fought, he\r\nburied his soldiers as well as the circumstances permitted, and then\r\nfollowed the fugitives as far as the desert. Returning thence, he laid\r\nthe land waste, and slew the barbarians who had fled for refuge into\r\nthe fortified places, because they were reported to have taken part in\r\nthe attack upon the Macedonians.[525] He traversed the whole country\r\nwhich the river Polytimetus waters in its course; but the country\r\nbeyond the place where the water of this river disappears is desert;\r\nfor though it has abundance of water, it disappears into the sand.[526]\r\nOther large and perennial rivers in that region disappear in a similar\r\nway:—the Epardus, which flows through the land of the Mardians; the\r\nAreius, after which the country of the Areians is named; and the\r\nEtymander, which flows through the territory of the Euergetae.[527] All\r\nof these are rivers of such a size that none of them is smaller than\r\nthe Thessalian river Peneius, which flows through Tempē and discharges\r\nitself into the sea. The Polytimetus is much too large to be compared\r\nwith the river Peneius.[528]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF BESSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he had accomplished this, he came to Zariaspa; where he remained\r\nuntil the depth of winter arrived.[529] At this time came to him\r\nPhrataphernes the viceroy of Parthia, and Stasanor, who had been sent\r\ninto the land of the Areians to arrest Arsames.[530] Him they brought\r\nwith them in chains, as also Barzanes, whom Bessus had appointed\r\nviceroy of the land of the Parthians, and some others of those who at\r\nthat time had joined Bessus in revolt. At the same time arrived from\r\nthe sea, Epocillus,[531] Melamnidas and Ptolemy, the general of the\r\nThracians, who had convoyed down to the sea the Grecian allies and\r\nthe money sent with Menes.[532] At this time also arrived Asander\r\nand Nearchus at the head of an army of Grecian mercenaries.[533]\r\nAsclepiodorus, viceroy of Syria, and Menes the deputy also arrived\r\nfrom the sea, at the head of another army. Then Alexander gathered a\r\nconference of those who were then at hand, and led Bessus in before\r\nthem. Having accused him of the betrayal of Darius, he ordered his nose\r\nand ears to be cut off, and that he should be taken to Ecbatana to be\r\nput to death there in the council of the Medes and Persians.[534] I\r\ndo not commend this excessive punishment; on the contrary, I consider\r\nthat the mutilation of the prominent features of the body is a\r\nbarbaric[535] custom, and I agree with those who say that Alexander\r\nwas induced to indulge his desire of emulating the Median and Persian\r\nwealth and to treat his subjects as inferior beings according to the\r\ncustom of the foreign kings. Nor do I by any means commend him for\r\nchanging the Macedonian style of dress which his fathers had adopted,\r\nfor the Median one,[536] being as he was a descendant of Heracles.[537]\r\nBesides, he was not ashamed to exchange the head-dress which he\r\nthe conqueror had so long worn, for that of the conquered Persians.\r\nNone of these things do I commend; but I consider Alexander’s great\r\nachievements prove, if anything can, that supposing a man to have a\r\nvigorous bodily constitution, to be illustrious in descent, and to be\r\neven more successful in war than Alexander himself; even supposing\r\nhe could sail right round Libya as well as Asia, and hold them both\r\nin subjection as Alexander indeed designed; even if he could add the\r\npossession of Europe to that of Asia and Libya; all these things would\r\nbe no furtherance to such a man’s happiness, unless at the same time he\r\npossess the power of self-control, though he has performed the great\r\ndeeds which have been supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MURDER OF CLITUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere also I shall give an account of the tragic fate of Clitus, son\r\nof Dropidas, and of Alexander’s mishap in regard to it. Though it\r\noccurred a little while after this, it will not be out of place here. The\r\nMacedonians kept a day sacred to Dionysus, and on that day Alexander\r\nused to offer sacrifice to him every year. But they say that on this\r\noccasion he was neglectful of Dionysus,[538] and sacrificed to the\r\nDioscūri[539] instead; for he had resolved to offer sacrifice to those\r\ndeities for some reason or other. When the drinking-party on this\r\noccasion had already gone on too long (for Alexander had now made\r\ninnovations even in regard to drinking, by imitating the custom of\r\nforeigners), and in the midst of the carouse a discussion had arisen\r\nabout the Dioscuri, how their procreation had been taken away from\r\nTyndareus and ascribed to Zeus, some of those present, in order to\r\nflatter Alexander, maintained that Polydeuces and Castor were in no way\r\nworthy to compare with him who had performed so many exploits. Such men\r\nhave always corrupted the character of kings and will never cease to\r\nruin the interests of those who happen to be reigning.[540] In their\r\ncarousal they did not even abstain from (comparing him with) Heracles;\r\nsaying that envy prevented the living from receiving the honours due\r\nto them from their associates. It was well known that Clitus had\r\nlong been vexed at Alexander for the change in his style of living\r\nin imitation of foreign kings, and at those who flattered him with\r\ntheir speech. At that time also, being heated with wine, he would not\r\npermit them either to insult the deity or, by depreciating the deeds\r\nof the ancient heroes, to confer upon Alexander a gratification which\r\ndeserved no thanks. He affirmed Alexander’s deeds were neither in fact\r\nso great or marvellous as they represented in their laudation; nor had\r\nhe achieved them by himself, but for the most part they were the deeds\r\nof the Macedonians. The delivery of this speech annoyed Alexander; and\r\nI do not commend it, for I think, in such a drunken bout, it would\r\nhave been sufficient if, so far as he was personally concerned, he\r\nhad kept silence, and not committed the error of indulging in the\r\nsame flattery as the others. But when some even mentioned Philip’s\r\nactions without exercising a just judgment, declaring that he had\r\nperformed nothing great or marvellous, they gratified Alexander; but\r\nClitus being then no longer able to contain himself, began to put\r\nPhilip’s achievements in the first rank, and to depreciate Alexander\r\nand his performances.[541] Clitus being now quite intoxicated, made\r\nother insolent remarks and even greatly reviled him, because forsooth\r\nhe had saved his life, when the cavalry battle had been fought with\r\nthe Persians at the Granicus. Then indeed, arrogantly stretching out\r\nhis right hand, he said:—“This hand, O Alexander, preserved thee\r\non that occasion.” Alexander could now no longer endure the drunken\r\ninsolence of Clitus; but jumped up against him in a great rage. He was\r\nhowever restrained by his boon-companions. As Clitus did not desist\r\nfrom his insulting remarks, Alexander shouted out a summons for his\r\nshield-bearing guards to attend him; but when no one obeyed him, he\r\nsaid that he was reduced to the same position as Darius, when he was\r\nled about under arrest by Bessus and his adherents, and that he now\r\npossessed the mere name of king. Then his companions were no longer\r\nable to restrain him; for according to some he leaped up and snatched a\r\njavelin from one of his confidential body-guards; according to others,\r\na long pike from one of his ordinary guards, with which he struck\r\nClitus and killed him.[542] Aristobulus does not say whence the drunken\r\nquarrel originated, but asserts that the fault was entirely on the side\r\nof Clitus, who, when Alexander had got so enraged with him as to jump\r\nup against him with the intention of making an end of him, was led away\r\nby Ptolemy, son of Lagus, the confidential body-guard, through the\r\ngateway, beyond the wall and ditch of the citadel where the quarrel\r\noccurred. He adds that Clitus could not control himself, but went back\r\nagain, and falling in with Alexander who was calling out for Clitus, he\r\nexclaimed:—“Alexander, here is Clitus!” Thereupon he was struck with a\r\nlong pike and killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S GRIEF FOR CLITUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think Clitus deserving of severe censure for his insolent behaviour\r\nto his king, while at the same time I pity Alexander for his mishap,\r\nbecause on that occasion he showed himself the slave of two vices,\r\nanger and drunkenness, by neither of which is it seemly for a prudent\r\nman to be enslaved. But then on the other hand I think his subsequent\r\nbehaviour worthy of praise, because directly after he had done the\r\ndeed he recognised that it was a horrible one. Some of his biographers\r\neven say that he propped the pike against the wall with the intention\r\nof falling upon it himself, thinking that it was not proper for him to\r\nlive who had killed his friend when under the influence of wine. Most\r\nhistorians do not mention this, but say that he went off to bed and lay\r\nthere lamenting, calling Clitus himself by name, and his sister Lanice,\r\ndaughter of Dropidas, who had been his nurse. He exclaimed that having\r\nreached man’s estate he had forsooth bestowed on her a noble reward for\r\nher care in rearing him, as she lived to see her own sons die fighting\r\non his behalf, and the king slaying her brother with his own hand.[543]\r\nHe did not cease calling himself the murderer of his friends; and for\r\nthree days rigidly abstained from food and drink, and paid no attention\r\nwhatever to his personal appearance. Some of the soothsayers revealed\r\nthat the avenging wrath of Dionysus had been the cause of his conduct,\r\nbecause he had omitted the sacrifice to that deity.[544] At last with\r\ngreat difficulty he was induced by his companions to touch food and to\r\npay proper attention to His person.[545] He then paid to Dionysus the\r\nsacrifice due to him, since he was not at all unwilling to attribute\r\nthe fatality rather to the avenging wrath of the deity than to his own\r\ndepravity. I think Alexander deserves great praise for this, that he\r\ndid not obstinately persevere in evil, or still worse become a defender\r\nand advocate of the wrong which had been done, but confessed that he\r\nhad committed a crime, being a man and not a god. There are some who\r\nsay that Anaxarchus the Sophist[546] was summoned into Alexander’s\r\npresence to give him consolation. Finding him lying down and groaning,\r\nhe laughed at him, and said that he did not know that the wise men of\r\nold for this reason made Justice an assessor of Zeus, because whatever\r\nwas done by him was justly done[547]; and therefore also that which was\r\ndone by the Great King ought to be deemed just, in the first place by\r\nthe king himself, and then by the rest of men. They say that Alexander\r\nwas then greatly consoled by these remarks.[548] But I assert that\r\nAnaxarchus did Alexander a great injury and one still greater than that\r\nby which he was then oppressed, if he really thought this to be the\r\nopinion of a wise man, that forsooth it is proper for a king to come to\r\nhasty conclusions and act unjustly, and that whatever is done by a king\r\nmust be deemed just, no matter how it is done. There is also a current\r\nreport that Alexander wished men to prostrate themselves before him as\r\nto a god, entertaining the notion that Ammon was his father, rather\r\nthan Philip; and that he now showed his admiration of the customs of\r\nthe Persians and Medes by changing the style of his dress, and by the\r\nalteration he made in the general etiquette of his court. There were\r\nnot wanting those who in regard to these matters gave way to his wishes\r\nwith the design of flattering him; among others being Anaxarchus, one\r\nof the philosophers attending his court, and Agis, an Argive who was an\r\nepic poet.[549]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDISPUTE BETWEEN CALLISTHENES AND ANAXARCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is said that Callisthenes the Olynthian, who had studied\r\nphilosophy under Aristotle, and was somewhat brusque in his manner, did\r\nnot approve of this conduct; and so far as this is concerned I quite\r\nagree with him. But the following remark of his, if indeed it has been\r\ncorrectly recorded, I do not think at all proper, when he declared that\r\nAlexander and his exploits were dependent upon him and his history, and\r\nthat he had not come to him to acquire reputation from him, but to make\r\nhim renowned in the eyes of men;[550] consequently that Alexander’s\r\nparticipation in divinity did not depend on the false assertion of\r\nOlympias in regard to the author of his birth, but on what he might\r\nreport to mankind in his history of the king. There are some writers\r\nalso who have said that on one occasion Philotas forsooth asked him,\r\nwhat man he thought to be held in especial honour by the people of\r\nAthens; and that he replied:—“Harmodius and Aristogeiton; because they\r\nslew one of the two despots, and put an end to the despotism.”[551]\r\nPhilotas again asked:—“If it happened now that a man should kill a\r\ndespot, to which of the Grecian States would you wish him to flee for\r\npreservation?” Callisthenes again replied:—“If not among others, at\r\nany rate among the Athenians an exile would find preservation; for they\r\nwaged war on behalf of the sons of Heracles against Eurystheus, who at\r\nthat time was ruling as a despot over Greece.”[552] How he resisted\r\nAlexander in regard to the ceremony of prostration, the following\r\nis the most received account.[553] An arrangement was made between\r\nAlexander and the Sophists in conjunction with the most illustrious\r\nof the Persians and Medes who were in attendance upon him, that this\r\ntopic should be mentioned at a wine-party. Anaxarchus commenced the\r\ndiscussion[554] by saying that he considered Alexander much more\r\nworthy of being deemed a god than either Dionysus or Heracles, not\r\nonly on account of the very numerous and mighty exploits which he\r\nhad performed, but also because Dionysus was only a Theban, in no way\r\nrelated to Macedonians; and Heracles was an Argive, not at all related\r\nto them, except that Alexander deduced his descent from him. He added\r\nthat the Macedonians might with greater justice gratify their king\r\nwith divine honours, for there was no doubt about this, that when he\r\ndeparted from men they would honour him as a god. How much more just\r\nthen would it be to worship him while alive, than after his death, when\r\nit would be no advantage to him to be honoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCALLISTHENES OPPOSES THE PROPOSAL TO HONOUR ALEXANDER BY PROSTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Anaxarchus had uttered these remarks and others of a similar\r\nkind, those who were privy to the plan applauded his speech, and\r\nwished at once to begin the ceremony of prostration. Most of the\r\nMacedonians, however, were vexed[555] at the speech and kept silence.\r\nBut Callisthenes interposed and said:—“O Anaxarchus, I openly declare\r\nthat there is no honour which Alexander is unworthy to receive,\r\nprovided that it is consistent with his being human; but men have made\r\ndistinctions between those honours which are due to men, and those due\r\nto gods, in many different ways, as for instance by the building of\r\ntemples and by the erection of statues. Moreover for the gods sacred\r\nenclosures are selected, to them sacrifice is offered, and to them\r\nlibations are made. Hymns also are composed in honour of the gods, and\r\neulogies for men. But the greatest distinction is made by the custom\r\nof prostration. For it is the practice that men should be kissed by\r\nthose who salute them[556]; but because the deity is located somewhere\r\nabove, it is not lawful even to touch him, and this is the reason no\r\ndoubt why he is honoured by prostration. Bands of choral dancers are\r\nalso appointed for the gods, and paeans are sung in their honour. And\r\nthis is not at all wonderful, seeing that certain honours are specially\r\nassigned to some of the gods and certain others to other gods, and,\r\nby Zeus, quite different ones again are assigned to heroes, which are\r\nvery distinct from those paid to the deities.[557] It is not therefore\r\nreasonable to confound all these distinctions without discrimination,\r\nexalting men to a rank above their condition by extravagant\r\naccumulation of honours, and debasing the gods, as far as lies in human\r\npower, to an unseemly level, by paying them honours only equal to those\r\npaid to men.” He said that Alexander would not endure the affront, if\r\nsome private individual were to be thrust into his royal honours by an\r\nunjust vote, either by show of hand or by ballot. Much more justly then\r\nwould the gods be indignant at those mortals who usurp divine honours\r\nor suffer themselves to be thrust into them by others. “Alexander not\r\nonly seems to be, but is in reality beyond any competition the bravest\r\nof brave men, of kings the most kingly, and of generals the most worthy\r\nto command an army. O Anaxarchus, it was thy duty, rather than any\r\nother man’s, to become the special advocate of these arguments now\r\nadduced by me, and the opponent of those contrary to them, seeing that\r\nthou associatest with him for the purpose of imparting philosophy and\r\ninstruction. Therefore it was unseemly to begin this discussion, when\r\nthou oughtest to have remembered that thou art not associating with\r\nand giving advice to Cambyses or Xerxes, but to the son of Philip, who\r\nderives his origin from Heracles and Aeacus,[558] whose ancestors came\r\ninto Macedonia from Argos, and have continued to rule the Macedonians,\r\nnot by force, but by law. Not even to Heracles himself while still\r\nalive were divine honours paid by the Greeks; and even after his death\r\nthey were withheld until a decree had been published by the oracle of\r\nthe god at Delphi that men should honour Heracles as a god. But if,\r\nbecause the discussion is held[559] in the land of foreigners, we ought\r\nto adopt the sentiments of foreigners, I demand, O Alexander, that thou\r\nshouldst bethink thyself of Greece, for whose sake the whole of this\r\nexpedition was undertaken by thee, that thou mightest join Asia to\r\nGreece. Therefore make up thy mind whether thou wilt return thither and\r\ncompel the Greeks, who are men most devoted to freedom, to pay thee the\r\nhonour of prostration, or whether thou wilt keep aloof from Greece, and\r\ninflict this honour on the Macedonians alone, or thirdly whether thou\r\nwilt thyself make a difference in every respect as to the honours to\r\nbe paid thee, so as to be honoured by the Greeks and Macedonians as a\r\nhuman being and after the manner of the Greeks, and by foreigners alone\r\nafter the foreign fashion of prostration. But if it is said that Cyrus,\r\nson of Cambyses, was the first man to whom the honour of prostration\r\nwas paid, and that afterwards this degrading ceremony continued in\r\nvogue among the Persians and Medes, we ought to bear in mind that\r\nthe Scythians, men poor but independent, chastised that Cyrus;[560]\r\nthat other Scythians again chastised Darius, as the Athenians and\r\nLacedaemonians did Xerxes, as Clearchus and Xenophon with their 10,000\r\nfollowers did Artaxerxes; and finally, that Alexander, though not\r\nhonoured with prostration, has conquered this Darius.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nCALLISTHENES REFUSES TO PROSTRATE HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy making these and other remarks of a similar kind, Callisthenes\r\ngreatly annoyed Alexander, but spoke the exact sentiments of the\r\nMacedonians. When the king perceived this, he sent to prevent the\r\nMacedonians from making any farther mention of the ceremony of\r\nprostration. But after the discussion silence ensued; and then the\r\nmost honourable of the Persians arose in due order and prostrated\r\ntheir bodies before him. But when one of the Persians seemed to have\r\nperformed the ceremony in an awkward way, Leonnatus, one of the\r\nCompanions, laughed at his posture as mean. Alexander at the time was\r\nangry with him for this, but was afterwards reconciled to him.[561]\r\nThe following account has also been given:—Alexander drank from a\r\ngolden goblet the health of the circle of guests, and handed it first\r\nto those with whom he had concerted the ceremony of prostration. The\r\nfirst who drank from the goblet rose up and performed the act of\r\nprostration, and received a kiss from him. This ceremony proceeded\r\nfrom one to another in due order. But when the pledging of health came\r\nto the turn of Callisthenes, he rose up and drank from the goblet,\r\nand drew near, wishing to kiss the king without performing the act of\r\nprostration. Alexander happened then to be conversing with Hephaestion,\r\nand consequently did not observe whether Callisthenes performed the\r\nceremony properly or not. But when Callisthenes was approaching to kiss\r\nhim, Demetrius, son of Pythonax, one of the Companions, said that he\r\nwas doing so without having prostrated himself. So the king would not\r\npermit him to kiss him; whereupon the philosopher said:—“I am going\r\naway only with the loss of a kiss.” I by no means approve any of these\r\nproceedings, which manifested both the insolence of Alexander on the\r\npresent occasion and the churlish nature of Callisthenes. But I think\r\nthat, so far as regards himself, it would have been quite sufficient\r\nif he had given his opinion discreetly, magnifying as much as possible\r\nthe exploits of the king, with whom no one thought it a dishonour to\r\nassociate. Therefore I consider that not without reason Callisthenes\r\nbecame odious to Alexander on account of the unseasonable freedom of\r\nspeech in which he indulged,[562] as well as from the egregious fatuity\r\nof his conduct. I surmise that this was the reason why such easy credit\r\nwas given to those who accused him of participating in the conspiracy\r\nformed against Alexander by his pages, and to those also who affirmed\r\nthat they had been incited to engage in the conspiracy by him alone.\r\nThe facts of this conspiracy were as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCONSPIRACY OF THE PAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a custom introduced by Philip, that the sons of those\r\nMacedonians who had enjoyed high office, should, as soon as they\r\nreached the age of puberty, be selected to attend the king’s court.\r\nThese youths were entrusted with the general attendance on the king’s\r\nperson and the protection of his body while he was asleep. Whenever the\r\nking rode out, some of them received the horses from the grooms, and\r\nbrought them to him, and others assisted him to mount in the Persian\r\nfashion. They were also companions of the king in the emulation of\r\nthe chase.[563] Among these youths was Hermolaüs, son of Sopolis, who\r\nseemed to be applying his mind to the study of philosophy, and to\r\nbe cultivating the society of Callisthenes for this purpose. There\r\nis current a tale about this youth to the effect that in the chase,\r\na boar rushed at Alexander, and that Hermolaüs anticipated him by\r\ncasting a javelin at the beast, by which it was smitten and killed.\r\nBut Alexander, having lost the opportunity of distinguishing himself\r\nby being too late in the assault, was indignant with Hermolaüs, and\r\nin his wrath ordered him to receive a scourging in sight of the other\r\npages; and also deprived him of his horse. This Hermolaüs, being\r\nchagrined at the disgrace he had incurred, told Sostratus, son of\r\nAmyntas, who was his equal in age and intimate confidential friend,\r\nthat life would be insupportable to him unless he could take vengeance\r\nupon Alexander for the affront. He easily persuaded Sostratus to join\r\nin the enterprise, since he was fondly attached to him. They gained\r\nover to their plans Antipater, son of Asclepiodorus, viceroy of Syria,\r\nEpimenes son of Arseas, Anticles son of Theocritus, and Philotas son\r\nof Carsis the Thracian. They therefore agreed to kill the king by\r\nattacking him in his sleep, on the night when the nocturnal watch\r\ncame round to Antipater’s turn. Some say that Alexander accidentally\r\nhappened to be drinking until daybreak; but Aristobulus has given the\r\nfollowing account: A Syrian woman, who was under the inspiration of\r\nthe deity, used to follow Alexander about. At first she was a subject\r\nof mirth to Alexander and his courtiers; but when all that she said\r\nin her inspiration was seen to be true, he no longer treated her\r\nwith neglect, but she was allowed to have free access to him both by\r\nnight and day, and she often took her stand near him even when he was\r\nasleep. And indeed on that occasion, when he was withdrawing from the\r\ndrinking-party she met him, being under the inspiration of the deity at\r\nthe time, and besought him to return and drink all night. Alexander,\r\nthinking that there was something divine in the warning, returned\r\nand went on drinking; and thus the enterprise of the pages fell\r\nthrough.[564] The next day, Epimenes son of Arseas, one of those who\r\ntook part in the conspiracy, spoke of the undertaking to Charicles son\r\nof Menander, who had become his confidential friend; and Charicles told\r\nit to Eurylochus, brother of Epimenes. Eurylochus went to Alexander’s\r\ntent and related the whole affair to Ptolemy son of Lagus, one of the\r\nconfidential body-guards. He told Alexander, who ordered those whose\r\nnames had been mentioned by Eurylochus to be arrested. These, being put\r\non the rack, confessed their own conspiracy, and mentioned the names of\r\ncertain others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nEXECUTION OF CALLISTHENES AND HERMOLAUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAristobulus says that the youths asserted it was Callisthenes who\r\ninstigated them to make the daring attempt; and Ptolemy says the\r\nsame.[565] Most writers, however, do not agree with this, but\r\nrepresent that Alexander readily believed the worst about Callisthenes,\r\nfrom the hatred which he already felt towards him, and because\r\nHermolaüs was known to be exceedingly intimate with him. Some authors\r\nhave also recorded the following particulars:—that Hermolaüs was\r\nbrought before the Macedonians, to whom he confessed that he had\r\nconspired against the king’s life, because it was no longer possible\r\nfor a free man to bear his insolent tyranny. He then recounted all\r\nhis acts of despotism, the illegal execution of Philotas, the still\r\nmore illegal one of his father Parmenio and of the others who were put\r\nto death at that time, the murder of Clitus in a fit of drunkenness,\r\nhis assumption of the Median garb, the introduction of the ceremony\r\nof prostration, which had been planned and not yet relinquished, and\r\nthe drinking-bouts and lethargic sleep arising from them, to which\r\nhe was addicting himself.[566] He said that, being no longer able\r\nto bear these things, he wished to free both himself and the other\r\nMacedonians. These same authors say that Hermolaüs himself and those\r\nwho had been arrested with him were stoned to death by those who were\r\npresent. Aristobulus says that Callisthenes was carried about with\r\nthe army bound with fetters, and afterwards died a natural death; but\r\nPtolemy, son of Lagus, says that he was stretched upon the rack and\r\nthen hanged.[567] Thus not even did these authors, whose narratives\r\nare very trustworthy, and who at the time were in intimate association\r\nwith Alexander, give accounts consistent with each other of events\r\nso well known, and the circumstances of which could not have escaped\r\ntheir notice. Other writers have given many various details of these\r\nsame proceedings which are inconsistent with each other; but I think I\r\nhave written quite sufficient on this subject. Though these events took\r\nplace shortly after the death of Clitus,[568] I have described them\r\namong those which happened to Alexander in reference to that General,\r\nbecause, for the purposes of narrative, I consider them very intimately\r\nconnected with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nALLIANCE WITH THE SCYTHIANS AND CHORASMIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother embassy from the European Scythians came to Alexander with the\r\nenvoys whom he had despatched to those people; for the king who was\r\nreigning over them at the time when he sent these envoys, happened\r\nto die, and his brother was reigning in his stead. The object of the\r\nembassy was to state that the Scythians were willing to do whatsoever\r\nAlexander commanded. They were also bringing to him from their king\r\nthe gifts which among them are deemed most valuable. They said their\r\nmonarch was willing to give his daughter to Alexander in marriage, in\r\norder to confirm the friendship and alliance with him; but if Alexander\r\nhimself deigned not to marry the princess of the Scythians, then he\r\nwas willing at any rate to give the daughters of the viceroys of the\r\nScythian territory and of the other mighty men throughout the country\r\nof Scythia to the most faithful of Alexander’s officers. He also sent\r\nword that he would come in person if bidden, in order to hear from\r\nAlexander’s own mouth what his orders were. At this time also came\r\nPharasmanes, king of the Chorasmians,[569] to Alexander with 1,500\r\nhorsemen, who affirmed that he dwelt on the confines of the nations\r\nof the Colchians and the women called Amazons,[570] and promised,\r\nif Alexander was willing to march against these nations in order to\r\nsubjugate the races in this district whose territories extended to the\r\nEuxine Sea, to act as his guide through the mountains and to supply\r\nhis army with provisions. Alexander then gave a courteous reply to\r\nthe men who had come from the Scythians, and one that was adapted to\r\nthe exigencies of that particular time; but said that he had no need\r\nof a Scythian wedding. He also commended Pharasmanes and concluded a\r\nfriendship and alliance with him, saying that at present it was not\r\nconvenient for him to march towards the Euxine Sea. After introducing\r\nPharasmanes as a friend to Artabazus the Persian, to whom he had\r\nintrusted the government of the Bactrians,[571] and to all the other\r\nviceroys who were his neighbours, he sent him back to his own abode.\r\nHe said that his mind at that time was engrossed by the desire of\r\nconquering the Indians; for when he had subdued them, he should possess\r\nthe whole of Asia. He added that when Asia was in his power he would\r\nreturn to Greece, and thence make an expedition with all his naval and\r\nmilitary forces to the eastern extremity of the Euxine Sea through the\r\nHellespont and Propontis.[572] He desired Pharasmanes to reserve the\r\nfulfilment of his present promises until then.\r\n\r\nAlexander then returned to the river Oxus, with the intention of\r\nadvancing into Sogdiana, because news was brought that many of the\r\nSogdianians had fled for refuge into their strongholds and refused\r\nto submit to the viceroy whom he had placed over them. While he was\r\nencamping near the river Oxus, a spring of water and near it another\r\nof oil rose from the ground not far from Alexander’s own tent. When\r\nthis prodigy was announced to Ptolemy, son of Lagus, the confidential\r\nbody-guard, he told Alexander, who offered the sacrifices which the\r\nprophets directed on account of the phenomenon. Aristander affirmed\r\nthat the spring of oil was the sign of labours; but it also signified\r\nthat after the labours there would be victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nSUBJUGATION OF SOGDIANA.—REVOLT OF SPITAMENES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe therefore crossed the river with a part of his army and entered\r\nSogdiana, leaving Polysperchon, Attalus, Gorgias, and Meleager there\r\namong the Bactrians, with instructions to guard the land, to prevent\r\nthe barbarians of that region from making any revolutionary change,\r\nand to reduce those who had already rebelled. He divided the army\r\nwhich he had with him into five parts; the first of which he put under\r\nthe command of Hephaestion, the second under that of Ptolemy, son of\r\nLagus, the confidential body-guard; over the third he put Perdiccas;\r\nCoenus and Artabazus commanded the fourth brigade for him, while he\r\nhimself took the fifth division and penetrated into the land towards\r\nMaracanda.[573] The others also advanced as each found it practicable,\r\nreducing by force some of those who had fled for refuge into the\r\nstrongholds, and capturing others who surrendered to them on terms of\r\ncapitulation. When all his forces reached Maracanda, after traversing\r\nthe greater part of the land of the Sogdianians, he sent Hephaestion\r\naway to plant colonies in the cities of Sogdiana. He also sent Coenus\r\nand Artabazus into Scythia, because he was informed that Spitamenes\r\nhad fled for refuge thither; but he himself with the rest of his army\r\ntraversed Sogdiana and easily reduced all the places still held by the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nWhile Alexander was thus engaged, Spitamenes, accompanied by some of\r\nthe Sogdianian exiles, fled into the land of the Scythians called\r\nMassagetians,[574] and having collected 600 horsemen from this nation,\r\nhe came to one of the forts in Bactriana. Falling upon the commander\r\nof this fort, who was not expecting any hostile demonstration, and\r\nupon those who were keeping guard with him, he destroyed the soldiers,\r\nand capturing the commander, kept him in custody. Being emboldened by\r\nthe capture of this fort, a few days after he approached Zariaspa; but\r\nresolving not to attack the city, he marched away after collecting a\r\ngreat quantity of booty. But at Zariaspa a few of the Companion cavalry\r\nhad been left behind on the score of illness, and with them Peithon,\r\nson of Sosicles,[575] who had been placed over the royal household of\r\nattendants at Zariaspa, and Aristonicus the harper. These men, hearing\r\nof the incursion of the Scythians, and having now recovered from their\r\nillness, took their arms and mounted their horses. Then collecting\r\neighty mercenary Grecian horsemen, who had been left behind to guard\r\nZariaspa, and some of the royal pages, they sallied forth against the\r\nMassagetians. Falling upon the Scythians, who had no suspicion of\r\nsuch an event, they deprived them of all the booty at the first onset,\r\nand killed many of those who were driving it off. But as no one was in\r\ncommand, they returned without any regard to order: and being drawn\r\ninto an ambush by Spitamenes and other Scythians, they lost seven of\r\nthe Companions and sixty of the mercenary cavalry. Aristonicus the\r\nharper was also slain there, having proved himself a brave man, beyond\r\nwhat might have been expected of a harper. Peithon, being wounded, was\r\ntaken prisoner by the Scythians.[576]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT AND DEATH OF SPITAMENES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this news was brought to Craterus, he made a forced march against\r\nthe Massagetians, who, when they heard that he was marching against\r\nthem, fled as fast as they could towards the desert. Following them\r\nup closely, he overtook those very men and more than 1,000 other\r\nMassagetian horsemen, not far from the desert. A fierce battle ensued,\r\nin which the Macedonians were victorious. Of the Scythians, 150\r\nhorsemen were slain; but the rest of them easily escaped into the\r\ndesert, for it was impossible for the Macedonians to pursue them any\r\nfurther. At this time, Alexander relieved Artabazus of the viceroyalty\r\nof the Bactrians, at his own request, on the ground of his advanced\r\nage; and Amyntas, son of Nicolaüs, was appointed viceroy in his\r\nstead.[577] Coenus was left with his own brigade and that of Meleager,\r\n400 of the Companion cavalry, and all the horse-archers, besides the\r\nBactrians, Sogdianians, and others who were under the command of\r\nAmyntas. They were all under strict injunctions to obey Coenus and to\r\nwinter there in Sogdiana, in order to protect the country and to arrest\r\nSpitamenes, if anyhow they might be able to draw him into an ambush,\r\nas he was wandering about during the winter. But when Spitamenes saw\r\nthat every place was occupied by the Macedonians for a garrison, and\r\nthat there would soon be no way of flight left open to him, he turned\r\nround against Coenus and the army with him, thinking that he would be\r\nbetter able to fight in this way. Coming to Bagae, a fortified place in\r\nSogdiana, situated on the confines of the countries of the Sogdianians\r\nand the Massagetian Scythians, he easily persuaded 3,000 Scythian\r\nhorsemen to join him in an invasion of Sogdiana. It is an easy matter\r\nto induce these Scythians to engage in one war after another, because\r\nthey are pinched by poverty, and at the same time have no cities or\r\nsettled abodes, to give them cause for anxiety about what is most dear\r\nto them. When Coenus ascertained that Spitamenes was advancing with his\r\ncavalry, he went to meet him with his army. A sharp contest ensued, in\r\nwhich the Macedonians were victorious, so that of the barbarian cavalry\r\nover 800 fell in the battle, while Coenus lost 25 horsemen and twelve\r\nfoot-soldiers. The consequence was, that the Sogdianians who were still\r\nleft with Spitamenes, as well as most of the Bactrians, deserted him in\r\nthe flight, and came to Coenus to surrender. The Massagetian Scythians\r\nhaving met with ill-success in the battle, plundered the baggage of\r\nthe Bactrians and Sogdianians who were serving in the same army as\r\nthemselves, and then fled into the desert in company with Spitamenes.\r\nBut when they were informed that Alexander was already on the start to\r\nmarch into the desert, they cut off the head of Spitamenes and sent\r\nit to him, with the hope by this deed of diverting him from pursuing\r\nthem.[578]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nOXYARTES BESIEGED IN THE SOGDIAN ROCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime Coenus returned to Alexander at Nautaca, as also did Craterus,\r\nPhrataphernes the viceroy of the Parthians, and Stasanor the viceroy of\r\nthe Areians, after executing all the orders which Alexander had given\r\nthem. The king then caused his army to rest around Nautaca, because it\r\nwas now mid-winter; but he despatched Phrataphernes into the land of\r\nthe Mardians and Tapurians to fetch Autophradates the viceroy, because,\r\nthough he had often been sent for, he did not obey the summons. He\r\nalso sent Stasanor into the land of the Drangians, and Atropates into\r\nMedia,[579] with the appointment of viceroy over the Medes, because\r\nOxodates seemed disaffected to him. Stamenes also he despatched to\r\nBabylon, because news came to him that Mazaeus the Babylonian governor\r\nwas dead. Sopolis, Epocillus, and Menidas he sent away to Macedonia,\r\nto bring him the army up from that country. At the first appearance\r\nof spring,[580] he advanced towards the rock in Sogdiana, to which he\r\nwas informed many of the Sogdianians had fled for refuge; among whom\r\nwere said to be the wife and daughters of Oxyartes the Bactrian, who\r\nhad deposited them for safety in that place, as if forsooth it were\r\nimpregnable. For he also had revolted from Alexander. If this rock\r\nwas captured, it seemed that nothing would be left to those of the\r\nSogdianians who wished to throw off their allegiance. When Alexander\r\napproached it, he found it precipitous on all sides against assault,\r\nand that the barbarians had collected provisions for a long siege. The\r\ngreat quantity of snow which had fallen helped to make the approach\r\nmore difficult to the Macedonians, while at the same time it kept the\r\nbarbarians supplied with plenty of water. But notwithstanding all\r\nthis, he resolved to assault the place; for a certain overweening and\r\ninsolent boast uttered by the barbarians had thrown him into a wrathful\r\nstate of ambitious pertinacity. For when they were invited to come to\r\nterms of capitulation, and it was held out to them as an inducement,\r\nthat if they surrendered the place, they would be allowed to withdraw\r\nin safety to their own abodes, they burst out laughing, and in their\r\nbarbaric tongue bade Alexander seek winged soldiers, to capture the\r\nmountain for him, since they had no apprehension of danger from other\r\nmen.[581] He then issued a proclamation that the first man who mounted\r\nshould have a reward of twelve talents,[582] the man who came next to\r\nhim the second prize, and the third so on in proportion, so that the\r\nlast reward should be three hundred darics[583] to the last prize-taker\r\nwho reached the top. This proclamation excited the valour of the\r\nMacedonians still more, though they were even before very eager to\r\ncommence the assault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER CAPTURES THE ROCK AND MARRIES ROXANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the men who had gained practice in scaling rocks in sieges, banded\r\nthemselves together to the number of three hundred, and provided\r\nthemselves with the small iron pegs with which their tents had been\r\nfastened to the ground, with the intention of fixing them into the\r\nsnow, where it might be seen to be frozen hard, or into the ground, if\r\nit should anywhere exhibit itself free from snow. Tying strong ropes\r\nmade of flax to these pegs, they advanced in the night towards the most\r\nprecipitous part of the rock, which was also most unguarded; and fixing\r\nsome of these pegs into the earth, where it made itself visible, and\r\nothers into the snow where it seemed least likely to break up, they\r\nhoisted themselves up the rock, some in one place and some in another.\r\nThirty of them perished in the ascent; and as they fell into various\r\nparts of the snows, not even could their bodies be found for burial.\r\nThe rest, however, reached the top of the mountain at the approach of\r\ndawn; and taking possession of it, they waved linen flags towards the\r\ncamp of the Macedonians,[584] as Alexander had directed them to do. He\r\nnow sent a herald with instructions to shout to the sentries of the\r\nbarbarians to make no further delay, but surrender at once; since “the\r\nwinged men” had been found, and the summits of the mountain were in\r\ntheir possession. At the same time the herald pointed at the soldiers\r\nupon the crest of the mountain. The barbarians, being alarmed by the\r\nunexpectedness of the sight, and suspecting that the men who were\r\noccupying the peaks were more numerous than they really were, and that\r\nthey were completely armed, surrendered, so frightened did they become\r\nat the sight of those few Macedonians. The wives and children of many\r\nimportant men were there captured, including those of Oxyartes. This\r\nchief had a daughter, a maiden of marriageable age, named Roxana,[585]\r\nwho was asserted by the men who served in Alexander’s army to have been\r\nthe most beautiful of all Asiatic women, with the single exception of\r\nthe wife of Darius.[586] They also say that no sooner did Alexander\r\nsee her than he fell in love with her; but though he was in love\r\nwith her, he refused to offer violence to her as a captive, and did\r\nnot think it derogatory to his dignity to marry her. This conduct of\r\nAlexander I think worthy rather of praise than blame. Moreover, in\r\nregard to the wife of Darius, who was said to be the most beautiful\r\nwoman in Asia, he either did not entertain a passion for her, or else\r\nhe exercised control over himself,[587] though he was young, and in\r\nthe very meridian of success, when men usually act with insolence and\r\nviolence. On the contrary, he acted with modesty and spared her honour,\r\nexercising a great amount of chastity, and at the same time exhibiting\r\na very proper desire to obtain a good reputation.[588]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMAGNANIMOUS TREATMENT OF THE FAMILY OF DARIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn relation to this subject there is a story current, that soon after\r\nthe battle which was fought at Issus between Darius and Alexander, the\r\neunuch who was guardian of Darius’s wife escaped and came to him. When\r\nDarius saw this man, his first inquiry was, whether his children, wife,\r\nand mother were alive? Ascertaining that they were not only alive, but\r\nwere called queens, and enjoyed the same personal service and attention\r\nwhich they had been accustomed to have with Darius, he thereupon made a\r\nsecond inquiry, whether his wife was still chaste? When he ascertained\r\nthat she remained so, he asked again whether Alexander had not offered\r\nany violence to her to gratify his lust? The eunuch took an oath and\r\nsaid: “O king, thy wife is just as thou didst leave her; and Alexander\r\nis the best and most chaste of men.” Upon this Darius stretched his\r\nhands towards heaven and prayed as follows:—“O King Zeus,[589] to\r\nwhom power has been assigned to regulate the affairs of kings among\r\nmen, do thou now protect for me especially the empire of the Persians\r\nand Medes, as indeed thou didst give it to me. But if I am no longer\r\nking of Asia according to thy behest, at any rate do thou hand over my\r\npower to no other man but Alexander.” Thus not even to enemies, I ween,\r\nare chaste actions a matter of unconcern. Oxyartes, hearing that his\r\nchildren were in the power of Alexander, and that he was treating his\r\ndaughter Roxana with respect, took courage and came to him. He was held\r\nin honour at the king’s court, as was natural after such a piece of\r\ngood fortune.[590]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF THE ROCK OF CHORIENES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander had finished his operations among the Sogdianians, and\r\nwas now in possession of the rock, he advanced into the land of the\r\nParaetacians, because many of the barbarians were said to be holding\r\nanother rock, a strongly fortified place in that country. This was\r\ncalled the rock of Chorienes; and to it Chorienes himself and many\r\nother chiefs had fled for refuge. The height of this rock was about\r\ntwenty stades, and the circuit about sixty. It was precipitous on all\r\nsides, and there was only one ascent to it, which was narrow and not\r\neasy to mount, since it had been constructed in spite of the nature of\r\nthe place. It was therefore difficult to ascend even by men in single\r\nfile and when no one barred the way. A deep ravine also enclosed[591]\r\nthe rock all round, so that whoever intended to lead an army up to it,\r\nmust long before make a causeway of earth over this ravine in order\r\nthat he might start from level ground, when he led his troops to the\r\nassault. Notwithstanding all this, Alexander undertook the enterprise.\r\nTo so great a pitch of audacity had he advanced through his career\r\nof success, that he thought every place ought to be accessible to\r\nhim,[592] and to be captured by him. He cut down the pines, which were\r\nvery abundant and lofty all round the mountain, and made ladders of\r\nthem, so that by means of them the soldiers might be able to descend\r\ninto the ravine[593]; for otherwise it was impossible for them to do\r\nso. During the daytime he himself superintended the work, keeping\r\nhalf of his army engaged in it; and during the night his confidential\r\nbody-guards, Perdiccas, Leonnatus, and Ptolemy, son of Lagus, in turn\r\nwith the other half of the army, divided into three parts, performed\r\nthe duty which had been assigned to each for the night. But they could\r\ncomplete no more than twenty cubits in a day, and not quite so much in\r\na night, though the whole army engaged in the labour; so difficult was\r\nthe place to approach and so hard was the work in it. Descending into\r\nthe ravine, they fastened pegs into the sharpest and narrowest part\r\nof it, distant from each other as far as was consistent with strength\r\nto support the weight of what was placed upon them. Upon these they\r\nplaced hurdles made of willow and osiers, very much in the form of a\r\nbridge. Binding these together, they loaded earth above them, so that\r\nthere might be an approach to the rock for the army on level ground.\r\nAt first the barbarians derided, as if the attempt was altogether\r\nabortive; but when the arrows began to reach the rock, and they were\r\nunable to drive back the Macedonians, though they themselves were on a\r\nhigher level, because the former had constructed screens to ward off\r\nthe missiles, that they might carry on their labour under them without\r\nreceiving injury, Chorienes grew alarmed at what was being done, and\r\nsent a herald to Alexander, beseeching him to send Oxyartes up to him.\r\nAlexander accordingly sent Oxyartes, who on his arrival persuaded\r\nChorienes to entrust himself and the place to Alexander; for he told\r\nhim that there was nothing which Alexander and his army could not take\r\nby storm; and as he himself had entered into an alliance of fidelity\r\nand friendship with him, he commended the king’s honour and justice in\r\nhigh terms, adducing other examples, and above all his own case for\r\nthe confirmation of his arguments. By these representations Chorienes\r\nwas persuaded and came himself to Alexander, accompanied by some of\r\nhis relations and companions. When he arrived, the king gave him a\r\ncourteous answer to his inquiries, and retained him after pledging his\r\nfidelity and friendship. But he bade him send to the rock some of those\r\nwho came down with him to order his men to surrender the place; and\r\nit was surrendered by those who had fled to it for refuge. Alexander\r\ntherefore took 500 of his shield-bearing guards and went up to get a\r\nview of the rock; and was so far from inflicting any harsh treatment\r\nupon Chorienes that he entrusted that very place to him again, and made\r\nhim governor of all that he had ruled before. It happened that the\r\narmy suffered much hardship from the severity of the winter, a great\r\nquantity of snow having fallen during the siege; while at the same\r\ntime the men were reduced to great straits from lack of provisions.\r\nBut Chorienes said he would give the army food for two months; and\r\nhe gave the men in every tent corn, wine, and salted meat out of the\r\nstores in the rock. When he had given them this, he said he had not\r\nexhausted even the tenth part of what had been laid up for the siege.\r\nHence Alexander held him in still greater honour, inasmuch as he had\r\nsurrendered the rock, not so much from compulsion as from his own\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER REACHES THE RIVER CABUL, AND RECEIVES THE HOMAGE OF TAXILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter performing this exploit, Alexander himself went to Bactra; but\r\nsent Craterus with 600 of the cavalry Companions and his own brigade of\r\ninfantry as well those of Polysperchon, Attalus, and Alcetas, against\r\nCatanes and Austanes, who were the only rebels still remaining in the\r\nland of the Paraetacenians.[594] A sharp battle was fought with them,\r\nin which Craterus was victorious; Catanes being killed there while\r\nfighting, and Austanes being captured and brought to Alexander. Of the\r\nbarbarians with them 120 horsemen and about 1,500 foot soldiers were\r\nkilled. When Craterus had done this, he also went to Bactra, where the\r\ntragedy in reference to Callisthenes and the pages befell Alexander.\r\nAs the spring was now over, he took the army and advanced from Bactra\r\ntowards India,[595] leaving Amyntas in the land of the Bactrians with\r\n3,500 horse, and 10,000 foot. He crossed the Caucasus[596] in ten days\r\nand arrived at the city of Alexandria, which had been founded in the\r\nland of the Parapamisadae when he made his first expedition to Bactra.\r\nHe dismissed from office the governor whom he had then placed over\r\nthe city, because he thought he was not ruling well. He also settled\r\nin Alexandria others from the neighbouring tribes and the soldiers\r\nwho were now unfit for service in addition to the first settlers, and\r\ncommanded Nicanor, one of the Companions, to regulate the affairs of\r\nthe city itself. Moreover he appointed Tyriaspes viceroy of the land of\r\nthe Parapamisadae and of the rest of the country as far as the river\r\nCophen.[597] Arriving at the city of Nicaea, he offered sacrifice to\r\nAthena and then advanced towards the Cophen, sending a herald forward\r\nto Taxiles[598] and the other chiefs on this side the river Indus, to\r\nbid them come and meet him as each might find it convenient. Taxiles\r\nand the other chiefs accordingly did come to meet him, bringing the\r\ngifts which are reckoned of most value among the Indians. They said\r\nthat they would also present to him the elephants which they had with\r\nthem, twenty-five in number. There he divided his army, and sent\r\nHephaestion and Perdiccas away into the land of Peucelaotis,[599]\r\ntowards the river Indus, with the brigades of Gorgias, Clitus,[600]\r\nand Meleager, half of the Companion cavalry, and all the cavalry of\r\nthe Grecian mercenaries. He gave them instructions either to capture\r\nthe places on their route by force, or to bring them over on terms\r\nof capitulation; and when they reached the river Indus, to make the\r\nnecessary preparations for the passage of the army. With them Taxiles\r\nand the other chiefs also marched. When they reached the river Indus\r\nthey carried out all Alexander’s orders. But Astes, the ruler of the\r\nland of Peucelaotis, effected a revolt, which both ruined himself and\r\nbrought ruin also upon the city into which he had fled for refuge. For\r\nHephaestion captured it after a siege of thirty days, and Astes himself\r\nwas killed. Sangaeus, who had some time before fled from Astes and\r\ndeserted to Taxiles, was appointed to take charge of the city. This\r\ndesertion was a pledge to Alexander of his fidelity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nBATTLES WITH THE ASPASIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander now took command of the shield-bearing guards, the\r\nCompanion cavalry with the exception of those who had been joined\r\nwith Hephaestion’s division, the regiments of what were called\r\nfoot-Companions, the archers, the Agrianians and the horse-lancers,\r\nand advanced with them into the land of the Aspasians, Guraeans and\r\nAssacenians.[601] Marching by a mountainous and rough road along the\r\nriver called Choes,[602] which he crossed with difficulty, he ordered\r\nthe main body of his infantry to follow at leisure; while he himself\r\ntook all the cavalry, and 800 of the Macedonian infantry whom he\r\nmounted upon horses with their infantry shields, and made a forced\r\nmarch, because he had received information that the barbarians who\r\ninhabited that district had fled for safety into the mountains which\r\nextend through the land and into as many of their cities as were strong\r\nenough to resist attack. Assaulting the first of these cities which\r\nwas situated on his route, he routed, at the first attack without\r\nany delay, the men whom he found drawn up in front of the city, and\r\nshut them up in it. He was himself wounded by a dart which penetrated\r\nthrough the breastplate into his shoulder; but the wound was only a\r\nslight one, for the breastplate prevented the dart from penetrating\r\nright through his shoulder. Leonnatus and Ptolemy, son of Lagus, were\r\nalso wounded. Then he encamped near the city at the place where the\r\nwall seemed most easy to assault. At dawn on the following day the\r\nMacedonians easily forced their way through the first wall, as it had\r\nnot been strongly built. The city had been surrounded with a double\r\nwall. At the second wall the barbarians stood their ground for a short\r\ntime; but when the scaling ladders were now being fixed, and the\r\ndefenders were being wounded with darts from all sides, they no longer\r\nstayed; but rushed through the gates out of the city towards the\r\nmountains. Some of them were killed in the flight, and the Macedonians,\r\nbeing enraged because they had wounded Alexander, slew all whom they\r\ntook prisoners. Most of them, however, escaped into the mountains,\r\nbecause they were not far from the city. Having levelled this city\r\nwith the ground, he marched to another, named Audaca, which he got\r\npossession of by capitulation. He left Craterus there with the other\r\ncommanders of the infantry to capture all the remaining cities which\r\nwould not yield of their own accord, and to set the affairs of the\r\nwhole country in such order as he should find most convenient under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS AGAINST THE ASPASIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander now took command of the shield-bearing guards, the archers,\r\nthe Agrianians, the brigade of Coenus and Attalus, the royal body-guard\r\nof cavalry, about four regiments of the other Companion cavalry, and\r\nhalf of the horse-archers, and advanced towards the river Euaspla,[603]\r\nwhere the chieftain of the Aspasians was. After a long journey he\r\narrived at the city on the second day. When the barbarians ascertained\r\nthat he was approaching they set fire to the city and fled to the\r\nmountains. But Alexander followed close upon the fugitives as far as\r\nthe mountains, and slaughtered many of them before they could manage\r\nto get away into the places which were difficult of access. Ptolemy,\r\nson of Lagus, observing that the leader himself of the Indians of\r\nthat district was on a certain hill, and that he had some of his\r\nshield-bearing guards round him, though he had with himself far fewer\r\nmen, yet he still continued to pursue him on horseback. But as the hill\r\nwas difficult for his horse to run up, he left it there, handing it\r\nover to one of the shield-bearing guards to lead. He then followed the\r\nIndian on foot, without any delay. When the latter observed Ptolemy\r\napproaching, he turned round, and so did the shield-bearing guards with\r\nhim. The Indian at close quarters struck Ptolemy on the chest through\r\nthe breastplate with a long spear, but the breastplate checked the\r\nviolence of the blow. Then Ptolemy, smiting right through the Indian’s\r\nthigh, overthrew him, and stripped him of his arms. When his men saw\r\ntheir leader lying dead, they stood their ground no longer; but the\r\nmen on the mountains, seeing their chieftain’s corpse being carried\r\noff by the enemy, were seized with indignation, and running down\r\nengaged in a desperate conflict over him on the hill. For Alexander\r\nhimself was now on the hill with the infantry who had dismounted from\r\nthe horses. These, falling upon the Indians, drove them away to the\r\nmountains after a hard struggle, and remained in possession of the\r\ncorpse. Then crossing the mountains he descended to a city called\r\nArigaeum, and found that this had been set on fire by the inhabitants,\r\nwho had afterwards fled. There Craterus with his army reached him,\r\nafter accomplishing all the king’s orders; and because this city seemed\r\nto be built in a convenient place, he directed that general to fortify\r\nit well, and settle in it as many of the neighbouring people as were\r\nwilling to live there, together with any of the soldiers who were unfit\r\nfor service. He then advanced to the place where he heard that most\r\nof the barbarians of the district had fled for refuge; and coming to\r\na certain mountain, he encamped at the foot of it. Meantime Ptolemy,\r\nson of Lagus, being sent out by Alexander on a foraging expedition,\r\nand advancing a considerable distance with a few men to reconnoitre,\r\nbrought back word to the king that he had observed many more fires\r\nin the camp of the barbarians than there were in Alexander’s. But\r\nthe latter did not believe in the multitude of the enemy’s fires.\r\nDiscovering, however, that the barbarians of the district had joined\r\ntheir forces into one body, he left a part of his army there near the\r\nmountain, encamped as they were, and taking as many men as seemed\r\nsufficient, according to the reports he had received, as soon as they\r\ncould descry the fires near at hand, he divided his army into three\r\nparts. Over one part he placed Leonnatus, the confidential body-guard,\r\njoining the brigades of Attalus and Balacrus with his own; the second\r\ndivision he put under the lead of Ptolemy, son of Lagus, including the\r\nthird part of the royal shield-bearing guards, the brigades of Philip\r\nand Philotas, two regiments of horse-archers, the Agrianians, and half\r\nof the cavalry. The third division he himself led towards the place\r\nwhere most of the barbarians were visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF THE ASPASIANS.—THE ASSACENIANS AND GURAEANS ATTACKED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy who were occupying the commanding heights perceived\r\nthe Macedonians approaching, they descended into the plain, being\r\nemboldened by their superiority in number and despising the\r\nMacedonians, because they were seen to be few. A sharp contest ensued;\r\nbut Alexander won the victory with ease. Ptolemy’s men did not range\r\nthemselves on the level ground, for the barbarians were occupying\r\na hill. Wherefore Ptolemy, forming his battalions into column, led\r\nthem to the point where the hill seemed most easily assailable, not\r\nsurrounding it entirely, but leaving room for the barbarians to flee\r\nif they were inclined to do so. A sharp contest also ensued with these\r\nmen, both from the difficult nature of the ground, and because the\r\nIndians are not like the other barbarians of this district, but are\r\nfar stronger than their neighbours. These men also were driven away\r\nfrom the mountain by the Macedonians. In the same way did Leonnatus\r\nwith the third division of the army; for his men also defeated those\r\nopposed to them. Ptolemy indeed says that all the men were captured, to\r\na number exceeding 40,000, and that 230,000 oxen were also taken, of\r\nwhich Alexander picked out the finest, because they seemed to him to\r\nexcel both in beauty and size, wishing to send them into Macedonia to\r\ntill the soil. Thence he marched towards the land of the Assacenians;\r\nfor he received news that these people had made preparations to\r\nfight him, having 20,000 cavalry, more than 30,000 infantry, and 30\r\nelephants. When Craterus had thoroughly fortified the city, for the\r\nfounding of which he had been left behind, he brought the heavier armed\r\nmen of his army for Alexander as well as the military engines, in case\r\nit might be necessary to lay siege to any place. Alexander then marched\r\nagainst the Assacenians at the head of the Companion cavalry, the\r\nhorse-archers, the brigades of Coenus and Polysperchon, the Agrianians,\r\nthe light-armed troops,[604] and the archers. Passing through the land\r\nof the Guraeans, he crossed the river Guraeus,[605] which gives its\r\nname to the land, with difficulty, both on account of its depth, and\r\nbecause its current is swift, and the stones in the river being round\r\ncaused those who stepped upon them to stumble.[606] When the barbarians\r\nperceived Alexander approaching, they durst not take their stand for a\r\nbattle in close array, but dispersed one by one to their various cities\r\nwith the determination of preserving these by resolute fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF MASSAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first place Alexander led his forces against Massaga,[607] the\r\nlargest of the cities in that district; and when he was approaching the\r\nwalls, the barbarians being emboldened by the mercenaries whom they had\r\nobtained from the more distant Indians to the number of 7,000, when\r\nthey saw the Macedonians pitching their camp, advanced against them\r\nwith a run. Alexander, seeing that the battle was about to be fought\r\nnear the city, was anxious to draw them further away from their walls,\r\nso that if they were put to rout, as he knew they would be, they might\r\nnot be able easily to preserve themselves by fleeing for refuge into\r\nthe city close at hand. When therefore he saw the barbarians running\r\nout, he ordered the Macedonians to turn round and retreat to a certain\r\nhill distant something about seven stades from the place where he had\r\nresolved to encamp. The enemy being emboldened, as if the Macedonians\r\nhad already given way, rushed upon them with a run and with no kind\r\nof order. But when the arrows began to reach them, Alexander at once\r\nwheeled round at the appointed signal, and led his phalanx against\r\nthem with a run. His horse-lancers, Agrianians, and archers first ran\r\nforward and engaged with the barbarians, while he himself led the\r\nphalanx in regular order. The Indians were alarmed at this unexpected\r\nmanœuvre, and as soon as the battle became a hand-to-hand conflict,\r\nthey gave way and fled into the city. About 200 of them were killed,\r\nand the rest were shut up within the walls. Alexander then led his\r\nphalanx up to the wall, from which he was soon after slightly wounded\r\nin the ankle with an arrow. On the next day he brought up his military\r\nengines and easily battered down a piece of the wall; but the Indians\r\nso gallantly kept back the Macedonians who were trying to force an\r\nentrance where the breach had been made, that he recalled the army for\r\nthis day. But on the morrow the Macedonians themselves made a more\r\nvigorous assault, and a wooden tower was drawn up to the walls, from\r\nwhich the archers shot at the Indians, and missiles were hurled from\r\nthe military engines which repulsed them to a great distance. But not\r\neven thus were they able to force their way within the wall. On the\r\nthird day he led the phalanx near again, and throwing a bridge from a\r\nmilitary engine over to the part of the wall where the breach had been\r\nmade, by this he led up the shield-bearing guards, who had captured\r\nTyre for him in a similar way.[608] But as many were urged on by\r\ntheir ardour, the bridge received too great a weight, and was snapped\r\nasunder, so that the Macedonians fell with it. The barbarians, seeing\r\nwhat was taking place, raised a great shout, and shot at them from the\r\nwall with stones, arrows, and whatever else any one happened to have at\r\nhand, or whatever any one could lay hold of at the time. Others issued\r\nforth by the small gates which they had between the towers in the wall,\r\nand at close quarters struck the men who had been thrown into confusion\r\nby the fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nSIEGES OF MASSAGA AND ORA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander now sent Alcetas with his own brigade to recover the men\r\nwho had been severely wounded, and to recall to the camp those who\r\nwere assailing the enemy. On the fourth day he brought up another\r\nbridge against the wall in like manner upon another military engine.\r\nThe Indians, as long as the ruler of the place survived, defended\r\nthemselves gallantly; but when he was struck and killed with a missile\r\nhurled from an engine, and as some of their number had fallen in the\r\nsiege, which had gone on without any cessation, while most of them\r\nwere wounded and unfit for service, they sent a herald to Alexander.\r\nHe was glad to preserve the lives of brave men; so he came to terms\r\nwith the Indian mercenaries on this condition, that they should be\r\nadmitted into the ranks with the rest of his army and serve as his\r\nsoldiers. They therefore came out of the city with their arms, and\r\nencamped by themselves upon a hill which was facing the camp of the\r\nMacedonians; but they resolved to arise by night and run away to\r\ntheir own abodes, because they were unwilling to take up arms against\r\nthe other Indians. When Alexander received intelligence of this,\r\nhe placed the whole of his army round the hill in the night, and\r\nintercepting them in the midst of their flight, cut them to pieces.\r\nHe then took the city by storm, denuded as it was of defenders; and\r\ncaptured the mother and daughter of Assacenus.[609] In the whole siege\r\nfive-and-twenty of Alexander’s men were killed. Thence he despatched\r\nCoenus to Bazira,[610] entertaining an opinion that the inhabitants\r\nwould surrender, when they heard of the capture of Massaga. He also\r\ndespatched Attalus, Alcetas, and Demetrius the cavalry officer to\r\nanother city, named Ora, with instructions to blockade it until he\r\nhimself arrived. The men of this city made a sortie against the forces\r\nof Alcetas; but the Macedonians easily routed them, and drove them into\r\nthe city within the wall. But affairs at Bazira were not favourable to\r\nCoenus, for the inhabitants showed no sign of capitulating, trusting\r\nto the strength of the place, because not only was it situated on a\r\nlofty eminence, but it was also thoroughly fortified all round. When\r\nAlexander learnt this, he started off to Bazira; but ascertaining that\r\nsome of the neighbouring barbarians were about to get into the city\r\nof Ora by stealth, being despatched thither by Abisares[611] for that\r\nvery purpose, he first marched to Ora. He ordered Coenus to fortify a\r\ncertain strong position to serve as a basis of operations against the\r\ncity of Bazira, and then to come to him with the rest of his army,\r\nafter leaving in that place a sufficient garrison to restrain the men\r\nin the city from enjoying the free use of their land. But when the\r\nmen of Bazira saw Coenus departing with the larger part of his army,\r\nthey despised the Macedonians, as not being able to contend with them,\r\nand sallied forth into the plain. A sharply contested battle ensued,\r\nin which 500 of the barbarians fell, and over seventy were taken\r\nprisoners. But the rest, fleeing for refuge into the city,[612] were\r\nnow more securely shut off from the country by the men in the fort.\r\nThe siege of Ora proved an easy matter to Alexander, for he no sooner\r\nattacked the walls than at the first assault he got possession of the\r\ncity, and captured the elephants which had been left there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF BAZIRA.—ADVANCE TO THE ROCK OF AORNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the men in Bazira heard this news, despairing of their own\r\naffairs, they abandoned the city about the middle of the night, and\r\nfled to the rock as the other barbarians were doing. For all the\r\ninhabitants deserted the cities and began to flee to the rock which\r\nis in their land, and is called Aornus.[613] For stupendous is this\r\nrock in this land, about which the current report is, that it was\r\nfound impregnable even by Heracles, the son of Zeus. I cannot affirm\r\nwith confidence either way, whether the Theban, Tyrian, or Egyptian\r\nHeracles[614] penetrated into India or not; but I am rather inclined to\r\nthink that he did not penetrate so far; for men are wont to magnify the\r\ndifficulty of difficult enterprises to such a degree as to assert that\r\nthey would have been impracticable even to Heracles. Therefore, I am\r\ninclined to think, that in regard to this rock the name of Heracles was\r\nmentioned simply to add to the marvellousness of the tale. The circuit\r\nof the rock is said to be about 200 stades (_i.e._ about twenty-three\r\nmiles), and its height where it is lowest, eleven stades (_i.e._, about\r\na mile and a quarter). There was only one ascent, which was artificial\r\nand difficult; on the summit of the rock there was abundance of pure\r\nwater, a spring issuing from the ground, from which the water flowed;\r\nand there was also timber, and sufficient good arable land for 1,000\r\nmen to till.[615] When Alexander heard this, he was seized with a\r\nvehement desire to capture this mountain also, especially on account\r\nof the legend which was current about Heracles. He then made Ora\r\nand Massaga fortresses to keep the land in subjection, and fortified\r\nthe city of Bazira. Hephaestion and Perdiccas also fortified for him\r\nanother city, named Orobatis, and leaving a garrison in it marched\r\ntowards the river Indus. When they reached that river they at once\r\nbegan to carry out Alexander’s instructions in regard to bridging it.\r\nAlexander then appointed Nicanor, one of the Companions, viceroy of the\r\nland on this side the river Indus; and in the first place leading his\r\narmy towards that river, he brought over on terms of capitulation the\r\ncity of Peucelaotis, which was situated not far from it. In this city\r\nhe placed a garrison of Macedonians, under the command of Philip, and\r\nthen reduced to subjection some other small towns situated near the\r\nsame river, being accompanied by Cophaeus and Assagetes, the chieftains\r\nof the land. Arriving at the city of Embolima,[616] which was situated\r\nnear the rock Aornus, he left Craterus there with a part of the army,\r\nto gather as much corn as possible into the city, as well as all the\r\nother things requisite for a long stay, so that making this their base\r\nof operations, the Macedonians might be able by a long siege to wear\r\nout the men who were holding the rock, supposing it were not captured\r\nat the first assault. He then took the bowmen, the Agrianians, and the\r\nbrigade of Coenus, and selecting the lightest as well as the best-armed\r\nmen from the rest of the phalanx, with 200 of the Companion cavalry and\r\n100 horse-bowmen, he advanced to the rock. This day he encamped where\r\nit appeared to him convenient; but on the morrow he approached a little\r\nnearer to the rock, and encamped again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF AORNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this juncture some of the natives came to him, and surrendering\r\nthemselves, offered to lead him to the part of the rock where it could\r\nbe most easily assailed, and from which it would be easy for him to\r\ncapture the place. With these he sent Ptolemy, son of Lagus, the\r\nconfidential body-guard, in command of the Agrianians and the other\r\nlight-armed troops, together with picked men from the shield-bearing\r\nguards. He gave this officer instructions, as soon as he had got\r\npossession of the place, to occupy it with a strong guard, and signal\r\nto him that it was held. Ptolemy proceeded along a road which was rough\r\nand difficult to pass, and occupied the position without the knowledge\r\nof the barbarians. After strengthening his position with a stockade\r\nand a ditch all round, he raised a beacon from the mountain, whence it\r\nwas likely to be seen by Alexander. The flame was at once seen, and on\r\nthe following day the king led his army forward; but as the barbarians\r\ndisputed his advance, he could do nothing further on account of the\r\ndifficult nature of the ground. When the barbarians perceived that\r\nAlexander could not make an assault, they turned round and attacked\r\nPtolemy, and a sharp battle ensued between them and the Macedonians,\r\nthe Indians making great efforts to demolish the stockade, and Ptolemy\r\nto preserve his position. But the barbarians, getting the worst of it\r\nin the skirmish, withdrew as the night came on. Alexander now selected\r\nfrom the Indian deserters a man who was not only devoted to him but\r\nacquainted with the locality,[617] and sent him by night to Ptolemy,\r\ncarrying a letter, in which it was written that as soon as the king\r\nattacked the rock, Ptolemy was to come down the mountain upon the\r\nbarbarians, and not be contented with holding his position in guard;\r\nso that the Indians, being assailed from both sides at once, might be\r\nin perplexity what course to pursue. Accordingly, starting from his\r\ncamp at daybreak, he led his army up the path by which Ptolemy had\r\nascended by stealth, entertaining the opinion that if he could force\r\nhis way in this direction and join his forces with those of Ptolemy,\r\nthe work would no longer be difficult for him; and so it turned out.\r\nFor until midday a smart battle was kept up between the Indians and\r\nthe Macedonians, the latter striving to force a way of approach, and\r\nthe former hurling missiles at them as they ascended. But as the\r\nMacedonians did not relax their efforts, advancing one after another,\r\nand those who were in advance rested till their comrades came up,\r\nafter great exertions they gained possession of the pass early in the\r\nafternoon, and formed a junction with Ptolemy’s forces. As the whole\r\narmy was now united, Alexander led it thence against the rock itself.\r\nBut the approach to it was still impracticable. Such then was the\r\nresult of this day’s labours. At the approach of the dawn he issued\r\nan order that each soldier individually should cut 100 stakes; and\r\nwhen this had been done he heaped up a great mound against the rock,\r\nbeginning from the top of the hill where they had encamped. From this\r\nmound he thought the arrows as well as the missiles launched from the\r\nmilitary engines would be able to reach the defenders of the rock.\r\nEvery one in the army assisted him in this work of raising the mound;\r\nwhile he himself superintended it, as an observer, not only commending\r\nthe man who completed his task with zeal and alacrity, but also\r\nchastising him who was dilatory in the pressing emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF AORNUS.—ARRIVAL AT THE INDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first day his army constructed the mound the length of a stade;\r\nand on the following day the slingers shooting at the Indians from the\r\npart already finished, assisted by the missiles which were hurled from\r\nthe military engines, repulsed the sallies which they made against\r\nthe men who were constructing the mound. He went on with the work for\r\nthree days without intermission, and on the fourth day a few of the\r\nMacedonians forcing their way occupied a small eminence which was on\r\na level with the rock. Without taking any rest, Alexander went on\r\nwith the mound, being desirous of connecting his artificial rampart\r\nwith the eminence which the few men were now occupying for him. But\r\nthen the Indians, being alarmed at the indescribable audacity of the\r\nMacedonians, who had forced their way to the eminence, and seeing that\r\nthe mound was already united with it, desisted from attempting any\r\nlonger to resist. They sent their herald to Alexander, saying that\r\nthey were willing to surrender the rock, if he would grant them a\r\ntruce. But they had formed the design of wasting the day by continually\r\ndelaying the ratification of the truce, and of scattering themselves\r\nin the night with the view of escaping one by one to their own abodes.\r\nWhen Alexander discovered this plan of theirs, he allowed them time\r\nto commence their retreat, and to remove the guard which was placed\r\nall round the place. He remained quiet until they began their retreat;\r\nthen taking 700 of the body-guards and shield-bearing infantry, he\r\nwas the first to scale the rock at the part of it abandoned by the\r\nenemy; and the Macedonians ascended after him, one in one place\r\nanother in another, drawing each other up. These men at the concerted\r\nsignal turned themselves upon the retreating barbarians, and killed\r\nmany of them in their flight. Others retreating with panic terror\r\nperished by leaping down the precipices; and thus the rock which had\r\nbeen inexpugnable to Heracles was occupied by Alexander. He offered\r\nsacrifice upon it, and arranged a fort, committing the superintendence\r\nof the garrison to Sisicottus, who long before had deserted from\r\nthe Indians to Bessus in Bactra, and after Alexander had acquired\r\npossession of the country of Bactra, entered his army and appeared to\r\nbe eminently trustworthy.\r\n\r\nHe now set out from the rock and invaded the land of the Assacenians;\r\nfor he was informed that the brother of Assacenus, with his elephants\r\nand many of the neighbouring barbarians had fled into the mountains\r\nin this district. When he arrived at the city of Dyrta,[618] he found\r\nnone of the inhabitants either in it or in the land adjacent. On the\r\nfollowing day he sent out Nearchus and Antiochus, the colonels of the\r\nshield-bearing guards, giving the former the command of the Agrianians\r\nand the light-armed troops,[619] and the latter the command of his\r\nown regiments and two others besides. They were despatched both to\r\nreconnoitre the locality and to try if they could capture some of the\r\nbarbarians anywhere in order to get information about the general\r\naffairs of the country; and he was especially anxious to learn news of\r\nthe elephants. He now directed his march towards the river Indus,[620]\r\nthe army going in advance to make a road for him, as otherwise this\r\ndistrict would have been impassable. Here he captured a few of the\r\nbarbarians, from whom he learnt that the Indians of that land had fled\r\nfor safety to Abisares, but that they had left their elephants there to\r\npasture near the river Indus. He ordered these men to show him the way\r\nto the elephants. Many of the Indians are elephant-hunters, and these\r\nAlexander kept in attendance upon him in high honour, going out to hunt\r\nthe elephants in company with them. Two of these animals perished in\r\nthe chase, by leaping down a precipice, but the rest were caught and\r\nbeing ridden by drivers were marshalled with the army. He also as he\r\nwas marching along the river lighted upon a wood the timber of which\r\nwas suitable for building ships; this was cut down by the army, and\r\nships were built for him, which were brought down the river Indus to\r\nthe bridge, which had long since been constructed by Hephaestion and\r\nPerdiccas at his command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER AT NYSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this country, lying between the rivers Cophen and Indus, which was\r\ntraversed by Alexander, the city of Nysa[621] is said to be situated.\r\nThe report is, that its foundation was the work of Dionysus, who built\r\nit after he had subjugated the Indians.[622] But it is impossible\r\nto determine who this Dionysus[623] was, and at what time, or from\r\nwhat quarter he led an army against the Indians. For I am unable to\r\ndecide whether the Theban Dionysus, starting from Thebes or from the\r\nLydian Tmolus[624] came into India at the head of an army, and after\r\ntraversing the territories of so many warlike nations, unknown to the\r\nGreeks of that time, forcibly subjugated none of them except that of\r\nthe Indians. But I do not think we ought to make a minute examination\r\nof the legends which were promulgated in ancient times about the\r\ndivinity; for things which are not credible to the man who examines\r\nthem according to the rule of probability, do not appear to be wholly\r\nincredible, if one adds the divine agency to the story. When Alexander\r\ncame to Nysa the citizens sent out to him their president, whose name\r\nwas Acuphis, accompanied by thirty of their most distinguished men as\r\nenvoys, to entreat Alexander to leave their city free for the sake of\r\nthe god. The envoys entered Alexander’s tent and found him seated in\r\nhis armour still covered with dust from the journey, with his helmet\r\non his head, and holding his spear in his hand. When they beheld the\r\nsight they were struck with astonishment, and falling to the earth\r\nremained silent a long time. But when Alexander caused them to rise,\r\nand bade them be of good courage, then at length Acuphis began thus to\r\nspeak: “The Nysaeans beseech thee, O king, out of respect for Dionysus,\r\nto allow them to remain free and independent; for when Dionysus had\r\nsubjugated the nation of the Indians, and was returning to the Grecian\r\nsea, he founded this city from the soldiers who had become unfit for\r\nmilitary service, and were under his inspiration as Bacchanals, so\r\nthat it might be a monument both of his wandering and of his victory,\r\nto men of after times; just as thou also hast founded Alexandria near\r\nmount Caucasus, and another Alexandria in the country of the Egyptians.\r\nMany other cities thou hast already founded, and others thou wilt found\r\nhereafter, in the course of time, inasmuch as thou hast achieved more\r\nexploits than Dionysus. The god indeed called the city Nysa, and the\r\nland Nysaea after his nurse Nysa. The mountain also which is near the\r\ncity he named Meros (_i.e._ thigh), because, according to the legend,\r\nhe grew in the thigh of Zeus. From that time we inhabit Nysa, a free\r\ncity, and we ourselves are independent, conducting our government with\r\nconstitutional order. And let this be to thee a proof that our city\r\nowes its foundation to Dionysus; for ivy, which does not grow in the\r\nrest of the country of India, grows among us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER AT NYSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this was very pleasant to Alexander to hear; for he wished that\r\nthe legend about the wandering of Dionysus should be believed, as well\r\nas that Nysa owed its foundation to that deity, since he had himself\r\nreached the place where Dionysus came, and had even advanced beyond\r\nthe limits of the latter’s march. He also thought that the Macedonians\r\nwould not decline still to share his labours if he advanced further,\r\nfrom a desire to surpass the achievements of Dionysus. He therefore\r\ngranted the inhabitants of Nysa the privilege of remaining free and\r\nindependent; and when he inquired about their laws, he commended them\r\nbecause the government was in the hands of the aristocracy. He required\r\nthem to send 300 of their horsemen to accompany him, and to select\r\nand send 100 of the aristocrats who presided over the government of\r\nthe State, who also were 300 in number. He ordered Acuphis to make\r\nthe selection, and appointed him governor of the land of Nysaea. When\r\nAcuphis heard this, he is said to have smiled at the speech; whereupon\r\nAlexander asked him why he laughed. Acuphis replied:—“How, O king,\r\ncould a single city deprived of 100 of its good men be still well\r\ngoverned? But if thou carest for the welfare of the Nysaeans, lead\r\nwith thee the 300 horsemen, and still more than that number if thou\r\nwishest: but instead of the hundred of the best men whom thou orderest\r\nme to select lead with thee double the number of the others who are\r\nbad, so that when thou comest here again the city may appear[625] in\r\nthe same good order in which it now is.” By these remarks he persuaded\r\nAlexander; for he thought he was speaking with prudence. So he ordered\r\nthem to send the horsemen to accompany him, but no longer demanded the\r\nhundred select men, nor indeed others in their stead. But he commanded\r\nAcuphis to send his own son and his daughter’s son to accompany him.\r\nHe was now seized with a strong desire of seeing the place where the\r\nNysaeans boasted to have certain memorials of Dionysus. So he went to\r\nMount Merus with the Companion cavalry and the foot guard, and saw\r\nthe mountain, which was quite covered with ivy and laurel and groves\r\nthickly shaded with all sorts of timber, and on it were chases of all\r\nkinds of wild animals.[626] The Macedonians were delighted at seeing\r\nthe ivy, as they had not seen any for a long time; for in the land of\r\nthe Indians there was no ivy, even where they had vines. They eagerly\r\nmade garlands of it, and crowned themselves with them, as they were,\r\nsinging hymns in honour of Dionysus, and invoking the deity by his\r\nvarious names.[627] Alexander there offered sacrifice to Dionysus, and\r\nfeasted in company with his companions.[628] Some authors have also\r\nstated, but I do not know if any one will believe it, that many of\r\nthe distinguished Macedonians in attendance upon him, having crowned\r\nthemselves with ivy, while they were engaged in the invocation of the\r\ndeity, were seized with the inspiration of Dionysus, uttered cries of\r\nEvoi in honour of the god, and acted as Bacchanals.[629]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nINCREDULITY OF ERATOSTHENES.—PASSAGE OF THE INDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny one who receives these stories may believe or disbelieve them\r\nas he pleases. But I do not altogether agree with Eratosthenes the\r\nCyrenaean,[630] who says that everything which was attributed to the\r\ndivine agency by the Macedonians was really said to gratify Alexander\r\nby their excessive eulogy. For he says that the Macedonians, seeing a\r\ncavern in the land of the Parapamisadians,[631] and hearing a certain\r\nlegend which was current among the natives, or themselves forming a\r\nconjecture, spread the report that this forsooth was the cave where\r\nPrometheus had been bound, that an eagle frequented it to feast on his\r\ninward parts, that when Heracles arrived there he killed the eagle and\r\nset Prometheus free from his bonds. He also says that by their account\r\nthe Macedonians transferred Mount Caucasus from the Euxine Sea to the\r\neastern parts of the earth, and the land of the Parapamisadians to that\r\nof the Indians;[632] calling what was really Mount Parapamisus by the\r\nname of Caucasus, in order to enhance Alexander’s glory, seeing that\r\nhe forsooth had gone over the Caucasus. He adds, that when they saw in\r\nIndia itself some oxen marked with the brand of a club, they concluded\r\nfrom this that Heracles had penetrated into India. Eratosthenes also\r\ndisbelieves the similar tale of the wandering of Dionysus. Let me leave\r\nthe stories about these matters undecided as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander arrived at the river Indus, he found a bridge made over\r\nit by Hephaestion, and two thirty-oared galleys, besides many smaller\r\ncraft.[633] He moreover found that 200 talents of silver,[634] 3,000\r\noxen, above 10,000 sheep for sacrificial victims, and thirty elephants\r\nhad arrived as gifts from Taxiles the Indian; 700 Indian horsemen also\r\narrived from Taxiles as a reinforcement, and that prince sent word that\r\nhe would surrender to him the city of Taxila,[635] the largest town\r\nbetween the rivers Indus and Hydaspes.[636] Alexander there offered\r\nsacrifice to the gods to whom he was in the habit of sacrificing, and\r\ncelebrated a gymnastic and horse contest near the river. The sacrifices\r\nwere favourable to his crossing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDIGRESSION ABOUT INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are statements about the river Indus which are quite\r\nunquestionable, and therefore let me record them. The Indus is the\r\nlargest of all the rivers in Asia and Europe, except the Ganges,[637]\r\nwhich is also an Indian river. It takes its rise on this side mount\r\nParapamisus, or Caucasus, and discharges its water into the Great Sea\r\nwhich lies near India in the direction of the south wind. It has two\r\nmouths, both of which outlets are full of shallow pools like the five\r\noutlets of the Ister (or Danube).[638] It forms a Delta in the land\r\nof the Indians resembling that of Egypt[639]; and this is called\r\nPattala in the Indian language. The Hydaspes, Acesines, Hydraotes, and\r\nHyphasis are also Indian rivers,[640] and far exceed the other rivers\r\nof Asia in size; but they are not only smaller but much smaller than\r\nthe Indus, just as that river itself is smaller than the Ganges. Indeed\r\nCtesias[641] says (if any one thinks his evidence to be depended upon),\r\nthat where the Indus is narrowest, its banks are forty stades apart;\r\nwhere it is broadest, 100 stades; and most of it is the mean between\r\nthese breadths.[642] This river Indus Alexander crossed at daybreak\r\nwith his army into the country of the Indians; concerning whom, in\r\nthis history I have described neither what laws they enjoy, nor what\r\nstrange animals their land produces, nor how many and what sort of fish\r\nand water-monsters are produced by the Indus, Hydaspes, Ganges, or the\r\nother rivers of India. Nor have I described the ants which dig up the\r\ngold for them,[643] nor the guardian griffins, nor any of the other\r\ntales that have been composed rather to amuse than to be received as\r\nthe relation of facts; since the falsity of the strange stories which\r\nhave been fabricated about India cannot be exposed by any one.[644]\r\nHowever, Alexander and those who served in his army exposed the\r\nfalsity of most of these tales; but there were even some of these very\r\nmen who fabricated other stories. They proved that the Indians whom\r\nAlexander visited with his army, and he visited many tribes of them,\r\nwere destitute of gold; and also that they were by no means luxurious\r\nin their mode of living. Moreover, they discovered that they were tall\r\nin stature, in fact as tall as any men throughout Asia, most of them\r\nbeing five cubits in height, or a little less. They were blacker than\r\nthe rest of men, except the Ethiopians[645]; and in war they were far\r\nthe bravest of all the races inhabiting Asia at that time. For I cannot\r\nwith any justice compare the race of the ancient Persians with those of\r\nIndia, though at the head of the former Cyrus, son of Cambyses, set out\r\nand deprived the Medes of the empire of Asia, and subdued many other\r\nraces partly by force and partly by voluntary surrender on their own\r\npart. For at that time the Persians were a poor people and inhabitants\r\nof a rugged land, having laws and customs very similar to the Laconian\r\ndiscipline.[646] Nor am I able with certainty to conjecture whether the\r\ndefeat sustained by the Persians in the Scythian land was due to the\r\ndifficult nature of the country invaded or to some other error on the\r\npart of Cyrus, or whether the Persians were really inferior in warlike\r\nmatters to the Scythians of that district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS AND RIVERS OF ASIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut of the Indians I shall treat in a distinct work,[647] giving the\r\nmost credible accounts which were compiled by those who accompanied\r\nAlexander in his expedition, as well as by Nearchus,[648] who sailed\r\nright round the Great Sea which is near India. Then I shall add what\r\nhas been compiled by Megasthenes[649] and Eratosthenes, two men of\r\ndistinguished authority. I shall describe the customs peculiar to the\r\nIndians and the strange animals which are produced in the country, as\r\nwell as the voyage itself in the external sea. But now let me describe\r\nso much only as appears to me sufficient to explain Alexander’s\r\nachievements. Mount Taurus divides Asia, beginning from Mycale, the\r\nmountain which lies opposite the island of Samos; then, cutting through\r\nthe country of the Pamphylians and Cilicians, it extends into Armenia.\r\nFrom this country it stretches into Media and through the land of the\r\nParthians and Chorasmians. In Bactria it unites with mount Parapamisus,\r\nwhich the Macedonians who served in Alexander’s army called Caucasus,\r\nin order, as it is said, to enhance their king’s glory; asserting that\r\nhe went even beyond the Caucasus with his victorious arms. Perhaps\r\nit is a fact that this mountain range is a continuation of the other\r\nCaucasus in Scythia, as the Taurus[650] is of the same. For this\r\nreason I have on a previous occasion called this range Caucasus, and\r\nby the same name I shall continue to call it in the future. This\r\nCaucasus extends as far as the Great Sea which lies in the direction\r\nof India and the East. Of the rivers in Asia worth consideration which\r\ntake their rise from the Taurus and Caucasus, some have their course\r\nturned towards the north, discharging themselves either into the lake\r\nMaeotis,[651] or into the sea called Hyrcanian, which in reality is a\r\ngulf of the Great Sea.[652] Others flow towards the south, namely, the\r\nEuphrates, Tigres, Indus, Hydaspes, Acesines, Hydraotes, Hyphasis, and\r\nall those that lie between these and the river Ganges. All these either\r\ndischarge their water into the sea, or disappear by pouring themselves\r\nout into marshes, as the river Euphrates[653] does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoever arranges the position of Asia in such a way that it is divided\r\nby the Taurus and the Caucasus from the west wind to the east wind,\r\nwill find that these two very large divisions are made by the Taurus\r\nitself, one of which is inclined towards the south and the south\r\nwind, and the other towards the north and the north wind. Southern\r\nAsia again may be divided into four parts, of which Eratosthenes and\r\nMegasthenes make India the largest. The latter author lived with\r\nSibyrtius,[654] the viceroy of Arachosia, and says that he frequently\r\nvisited Sandracotus, king of the Indians.[655] These authors say that\r\nthe smallest of the four parts is that which is bounded by the river\r\nEuphrates and extends to our inland sea. The other two lying between\r\nthe rivers Euphrates and Indus are scarcely worthy to be compared with\r\nIndia, if they were joined together. They say that India is bounded\r\ntowards the east and the east wind as far as the south by the Great\r\nSea, towards the north by mount Caucasus, as far as its junction with\r\nthe Taurus; and that the river Indus cuts it off towards the west and\r\nthe north-west wind, as far as the Great Sea. The greater part of it\r\nis a plain, which, as they conjecture, has been formed by the alluvial\r\ndeposits of the rivers; just as the plains in the rest of the earth\r\nlying near the sea are for the most part due to the alluvial action of\r\nthe rivers taken singly. Consequently, the names by which the countries\r\nare called were attached in ancient times to the rivers. For instance,\r\na certain plain was called after the Hermus, which rises in the\r\ncountry of Asia from the mountain of Mother Dindymene,[656] and after\r\nflowing past the Aeolian city of Smyrna discharges its water into the\r\nsea. Another Lydian plain is named after the Cayster, a Lydian river;\r\nanother from the Caïcus in Mysia; and the Carian plain, extending as\r\nfar as the Ionian city of Miletus, is named from the Maeander. Both\r\nHerodotus and Hecataeus[657] the historians (unless the work about\r\nthe Egyptian country is by another person, and not by Hecataeus) in\r\nlike manner call Egypt a gift of the river[658]; and Herodotus has\r\nshown by no uncertain proofs that such is the case[659]; so that even\r\nthe country itself perhaps received its name from the river. For that\r\nthe river which both the Egyptians and men outside Egypt now name the\r\nNile, was in ancient times called Aegyptus, Homer is sufficient to\r\nprove; since he says that Menelaüs stationed his ships at the outlet\r\nof the river Aegyptus.[660] If therefore single rivers by themselves,\r\nand those not large ones, are sufficient to form an extensive tract\r\nof country, while flowing forward into the sea, since they carry down\r\nslime and mud from the higher districts whence they derive their\r\nsources, surely it is unbecoming to exhibit incredulity about India,\r\nhow it has come to pass that most of it is a plain, which has been\r\nformed by the alluvial deposits of its rivers. For if the Hermus, the\r\nCayster, the Caïcus, the Maeander, and all the other[661] rivers of\r\nAsia which discharge their waters into the midland sea were all put\r\ntogether, they would not be worthy of comparison for volume of water\r\nwith one of the Indian rivers. Not only do I mean the Ganges, which is\r\nthe largest, and with which neither the water of the Egyptian Nile nor\r\nthe Ister flowing through Europe is worthy to compare; but if all those\r\nrivers were mingled together they would not even then become equal to\r\nthe river Indus, which is a large river as soon as it issues from its\r\nsprings, and after receiving fifteen rivers,[662] all larger than those\r\nin the province of Asia, discharges its water into the sea, retaining\r\nits own name and absorbing those of its tributaries. Let these remarks\r\nwhich I have made about India suffice for the present, and let the rest\r\nbe reserved for my “Description of India.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF BRIDGING RIVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Alexander constructed his bridge over the river Indus, is explained\r\nneither by Aristobulus nor Ptolemy, authors whom I usually follow; nor\r\nam I able to form a decided opinion whether the passage was bridged\r\nwith boats, as the Hellespont was by Xerxes and the Bosporus and the\r\nIster were by Darius,[663] or whether he made a continuous bridge\r\nover the river. To me it seems probable that the bridge was made of\r\nboats; for the depth of the water would not have admitted of the\r\nconstruction of a regular bridge, nor could so enormous a work have\r\nbeen completed in so short a time.[664] If the passage was bridged with\r\nboats, I cannot decide whether the vessels being fastened together\r\nwith ropes and moored in a row were sufficient to form the bridge,\r\nas Herodotus the Halicarnassian says the Hellespont was bridged, or\r\nwhether the work was effected in the way in which the bridge upon the\r\nIster and that upon the Celtic Rhine[665] are made by the Romans, and\r\nin the way in which they bridged the Euphrates and Tigres, as often\r\nas necessity compelled them. However, as I know myself, the Romans\r\nfind the quickest way of making a bridge to be with vessels; and this\r\nmethod I shall on the present occasion explain, because it is worth\r\ndescribing. At a pre-concerted signal they let the vessels loose down\r\nthe stream, not with their prows forward, but as if backing water.[666]\r\nAs might naturally be expected, the stream carries them down, but a\r\nskiff furnished with oars holds them back, until it settles them in the\r\nplace assigned to them. Then pyramidal wicker-baskets made of willow,\r\nfull of unhewn stones, are let down into the water from the prow of\r\neach vessel, in order to hold it up against the force of the stream.\r\nAs soon as any one of these vessels has been held fast, another is in\r\nthe same way moored with its prow against the stream, distant from\r\nthe first as far as is consistent with their supporting what is put\r\nupon them. On both of them are placed pieces of timber with sharp ends\r\nprojecting out, on which cross-planks are placed to bind them together;\r\nand so proceeds the work through all the vessels which are required to\r\nbridge the river. At each end of this bridge firmly fixed gangways are\r\nthrown forward,[667] so that the approach may be safer for the horses\r\nand beasts of burden, and at the same time to serve as a bond to the\r\nbridge. In a short time the whole is finished with a great noise and\r\nbustle; but yet discipline is not relaxed while the work is going on.\r\nIn each vessel the exhortations of the overseers to the men, or their\r\ncensures of sluggishness, neither prevent the orders being heard nor\r\nimpede the rapidity of the work.[668]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nMARCH FROM THE INDUS TO THE HYDASPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been the method of constructing bridges, practised by the\r\nRomans from olden times; but how Alexander laid a bridge over the\r\nriver Indus I cannot say, because those who served in his army have\r\nsaid nothing about it. But I should think that the bridge was made\r\nas near as possible as I have described, or if it were effected by\r\nsome other contrivance so let it be. When Alexander had crossed to\r\nthe other side of the river Indus, he again offered sacrifice there,\r\naccording to his custom.[669] Then starting from the Indus, he arrived\r\nat Taxila, a large and prosperous city, in fact the largest of those\r\nsituated between the rivers Indus and Hydaspes. He was received in\r\na friendly manner by Taxiles, the governor of the city, and by the\r\nIndians of that place; and he added to their territory as much of the\r\nadjacent country as they asked for. Thither also came to him envoys\r\nfrom Abisares, king of the mountaineer Indians, the embassy including\r\nthe brother of Abisares as well as the other most notable men. Other\r\nenvoys also came from Doxareus, the chief of the province, bringing\r\ngifts with them. Here again at Taxila Alexander offered the sacrifices\r\nwhich were customary for him to offer, and celebrated a gymnastic and\r\nequestrian contest. Having appointed Philip, son of Machatas, viceroy\r\nof the Indians of that district, he left a garrison in Taxila, as\r\nwell as the soldiers who were invalided by sickness, and then marched\r\ntowards the river Hydaspes. For he was informed that Porus,[670] with\r\nthe whole of his army was on the other side of that river, having\r\ndetermined either to prevent him from making the passage, or to attack\r\nhim while crossing. When Alexander ascertained this, he sent Coenus,\r\nson of Polemocrates, back to the river Indus, with instructions to cut\r\nin pieces all the vessels which he had prepared for the passage of\r\nthat river, and to bring them to the river Hydaspes. Coenus cut the\r\nvessels in pieces and conveyed them thither, the smaller ones being cut\r\ninto two parts, and the thirty-oared galleys into three. The sections\r\nwere conveyed upon waggons, as far as the bank of the Hydaspes; and\r\nthere the vessels were fixed together again, and seen as a fleet upon\r\nthat river. Alexander took the forces which he had when he arrived at\r\nTaxila, and the 5,000 Indians under the command of Taxiles and the\r\nchiefs of that district, and marched towards the same river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPORUS OBSTRUCTS ALEXANDER’S PASSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander encamped on the bank of the Hydaspes, and Porus was seen\r\nwith all his army and his large troop of elephants lining the opposite\r\nbank.[671] He remained to guard the passage at the place where he\r\nsaw Alexander had encamped; and sent guards to all the other parts\r\nof the river which were easily fordable, placing officers over each\r\ndetachment, being resolved to obstruct the passage of the Macedonians.\r\nWhen Alexander saw this, he thought it advisable to move his army in\r\nvarious directions, to distract the attention of Porus, and render\r\nhim uncertain what to do. Dividing his army into many parts, he led\r\nsome of his troops now in one direction and now in another, at one\r\ntime ravaging the enemy’s country, at another looking out for a place\r\nwhere the river might appear easier for him to ford it. The rest of\r\nhis troops he entrusted[672] to his different generals, and sent them\r\nabout in many directions. He also conveyed corn from all quarters into\r\nhis camp from the land on this side the Hydaspes, so that it might be\r\nevident to Porus that he had resolved to remain quiet near the bank\r\nuntil the water of the river subsided in the winter, and afforded him\r\na passage in many places. As his vessels were sailing up and down\r\nthe river, and skins were being filled with hay, and the whole bank\r\nappeared to be covered in one place with cavalry and in another with\r\ninfantry, Porus was not allowed to keep at rest, or to bring his\r\npreparations together from all sides to any one point if he selected\r\nthis as suitable for the defence of the passage. Besides at this season\r\nall the Indian rivers were flowing with swollen and turbid waters and\r\nwith rapid currents; for it was the time of year when the sun is wont\r\nto turn towards the summer solstice.[673] At this season incessant and\r\nheavy rain falls in India; and the snows on the Caucasus, whence most\r\nof the rivers have their sources, melt and swell their streams to a\r\ngreat degree. But in the winter they again subside, become small and\r\nclear, and are fordable in certain places, with the exception of the\r\nIndus, Ganges, and perhaps one or two others. At any rate the Hydaspes\r\nbecomes fordable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER AND PORUS AT THE HYDASPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander therefore spread a report that he would wait for that season\r\nof the year, if his passage was obstructed at the present time; but\r\nyet all the time he was waiting in ambush to see whether by rapidity\r\nof movement he could steal a passage anywhere without being observed.\r\nBut he perceived that it was impossible for him to cross at the place\r\nwhere Porus himself had encamped near the bank of the Hydaspes, not\r\nonly on account of the multitude of his elephants, but also because\r\nhis large army, arranged in order of battle and splendidly accoutred,\r\nwas ready to attack his men as they emerged from the water. Moreover\r\nhe thought that his horses would not be willing to mount the opposite\r\nbank, because the elephants would at once fall upon them and frighten\r\nthem both by their aspect and trumpeting; nor even before that would\r\nthey remain upon the inflated hides during the passage of the river;\r\nbut when they looked across and saw the elephants they would become\r\nfrantic and leap into the water. He therefore resolved to steal a\r\ncrossing by the following manœuvre:—In the night he led most of his\r\ncavalry along the bank in various directions, making a clamour and\r\nraising the battle-cry in honour of Enyalius.[674] Every kind of noise\r\nwas raised, as if they were making all the preparations necessary for\r\ncrossing the river. Porus also marched along the river at the head of\r\nhis elephants opposite the places where the clamour was heard, and\r\nAlexander thus gradually got him into the habit of leading his men\r\nalong opposite the noise. But when this occurred frequently, and there\r\nwas merely a clamour and a raising of the battle-cry, Porus no longer\r\ncontinued to move about to meet the expected advance of the cavalry;\r\nbut perceiving that his fear had been groundless,[675] he kept his\r\nposition in the camp. However he posted his scouts at many places along\r\nthe bank. When Alexander had brought it about that the mind of Porus no\r\nlonger entertained any fear of his nocturnal attempts, he devised the\r\nfollowing stratagem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S STRATAGEM TO GET ACROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was in the bank of the Hydaspes, a projecting headland, where the\r\nriver makes a remarkable bend. It was densely covered by a grove,[676]\r\ncontaining all sorts of trees; and over against it in the river was an\r\nisland full of trees and without a foot-track, on account of its being\r\nuninhabited. Perceiving that this island was right in front of the\r\nheadland, and that both the spots were woody and adapted to conceal his\r\nattempt to cross the river, he resolved to convey his army over at this\r\nplace. The headland and island were 150 stades distant from his great\r\ncamp.[677] Along the whole of the bank, he posted sentries, separated\r\nas far as was consistent with keeping each other in sight, and easily\r\nhearing when any order should be sent along from any quarter. From\r\nall sides also during many nights clamours were raised and fires were\r\nburnt. But when he had made up his mind to undertake the passage of\r\nthe river, he openly prepared his measures for crossing opposite the\r\ncamp. Craterus had been left behind at the camp with his own division\r\nof cavalry, and the horsemen from the Arachotians and Parapamisadians,\r\nas well as the brigades of Alcetas and Polysperchon from the phalanx\r\nof the Macedonian infantry, together with the chiefs of the Indians\r\ndwelling this side of the Hyphasis, who had with them 5,000 men. He\r\ngave Craterus orders not to cross the river before Porus moved off\r\nwith his forces against them, or before he ascertained that Porus was\r\nin flight and that they were victorious.[678] “If however,” said he,\r\n“Porus should take only a part of his army and march against me, and\r\nleave the other part with the elephants in his camp, in that case do\r\nthou also remain in thy present position. But if he leads all his\r\nelephants with him against me, and a part of the rest of his army is\r\nleft behind in the camp, then do thou cross the river with all speed.\r\nFor it is the elephants alone,” said he, “which render it impossible\r\nfor the horses to land on the other bank. The rest of the army can\r\neasily cross.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE HYDASPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the injunctions laid upon Craterus. Between the island\r\nand the great camp where Alexander had left this general, he posted\r\nMeleager, Attalus, and Gorgias, with the Grecian mercenaries, cavalry\r\nand infantry, giving them instructions to cross in detachments,\r\nbreaking up the army as soon as they saw the Indians already involved\r\nin battle. He then picked the select body-guard called the Companions,\r\nas well as the cavalry regiments of Hephaestion, Perdiccas, and\r\nDemetrius, the cavalry from Bactria, Sogdiana, and Scythia, and the\r\nDaan horse-archers; and from the phalanx of infantry the shield-bearing\r\nguards, the brigades of Clitus and Coenus, with the archers and\r\nAgrianians, and made a secret march, keeping far away from the bank\r\nof the river, in order not to be seen marching towards the island\r\nand headland, from which he had determined to cross. There the skins\r\nwere filled in the night with the hay which had been procured long\r\nbefore, and they were tightly stitched up. In the night a furious\r\nstorm of rain occurred, by which his preparations and attempt to cross\r\nwere rendered still more unobserved, since the noise of the thunder\r\nand the storm drowned with its din the clatter of the weapons and the\r\nnoise which arose from the orders given by the officers. Most of the\r\nvessels, the thirty-oared galleys included with the rest, had been\r\ncut in pieces by his order and conveyed to this place, where they had\r\nbeen fixed together again[679] and hidden in the wood. At the approach\r\nof daylight, both the wind and the rain calmed down; and the rest of\r\nthe army went over opposite the island, the cavalry mounting upon the\r\nskins, and as many of the foot soldiers as the boats would receive\r\ngetting into them. They went so secretly that they were not observed by\r\nthe sentinels posted by Porus, before they had already got beyond the\r\nisland and were only a little way from the other bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE HYDASPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander himself embarked in a thirty-oared galley and went over,\r\naccompanied by Perdiccas, Lysimachus, the confidential body-guards,\r\nSeleucus, one of the Companions, who was afterwards king,[680] and half\r\nof the shield-bearing guards; the rest of these troops being conveyed\r\nin other galleys of the same size. When the soldiers got beyond the\r\nisland, they openly directed their course to the bank; and when the\r\nsentinels perceived that they had started, they at once rode off to\r\nPorus as fast as each man’s horse could gallop. Alexander himself was\r\nthe first to land, and he at once took the cavalry as they kept on\r\nlanding from his own and the other thirty-oared galleys, and drew them\r\nup in proper order. For the cavalry had received orders to land first;\r\nand at the head of these in regular array he advanced. But through\r\nignorance of the locality he had effected a landing on ground which\r\nwas not a part of the mainland, but an island, a large one indeed and\r\nwhere from the fact that it was an island, he more easily escaped\r\nnotice. It was cut off from the rest of the land by a part of the\r\nriver where the water was shallow. However, the furious storm of rain,\r\nwhich lasted the greater part of the night, had swelled the water so\r\nmuch that his cavalry could not find out the ford; and he was afraid\r\nthat he would have to undergo another labour in crossing as great as\r\nthe first. But when at last the ford was found, he led his men through\r\nit with much difficulty; for where the water was deepest, it reached\r\nhigher than the breasts of the infantry; and of the horses only the\r\nheads rose above the river.[681] When he had also crossed this piece\r\nof water, he selected the choice guard of cavalry, and the best men\r\nfrom the other cavalry regiments, and brought them up from column into\r\nline on the right wing.[682] In front of all the cavalry he posted the\r\nhorse-archers, and placed next to the cavalry in front of the other\r\ninfantry the royal shield-bearing guards under the command of Seleucus.\r\nNear these he placed the royal foot-guard, and next to these the other\r\nshield-bearing guards, as each happened at the time to have the right\r\nof precedence. On each side, at the extremities of the phalanx, his\r\narchers, Agrianians and javelin-throwers were posted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE AT THE HYDASPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus arranged his army, he ordered the infantry to follow at\r\na slow pace and in regular order, numbering as it did not much under\r\n6,000 men; and because he thought he was superior in cavalry, he\r\ntook only his horse-soldiers, who were 5,000 in number, and led them\r\nforward with speed. He also instructed Tauron, the commander of the\r\narchers, to lead them on also with speed to back up the cavalry. He\r\nhad come to the conclusion that if Porus should engage him with all\r\nhis forces, he would easily be able to overcome him by attacking with\r\nhis cavalry, or to stand on the defensive until his infantry arrived\r\nin the course of the action; but if the Indians should be alarmed at\r\nhis extraordinary audacity in making the passage of the river and take\r\nto flight, he would be able to keep close to them in their flight, so\r\nthat the slaughter of them in the retreat being greater, there would\r\nbe only a slight work left for him. Aristobulus says that the son of\r\nPorus arrived with about sixty chariots, before Alexander made his\r\nlater passage from the large island, and that he could have hindered\r\nAlexander’s crossing (for he made the passage with difficulty even when\r\nno one opposed him); if the Indians had leaped down from their chariots\r\nand assaulted those who first emerged from the water. But he passed by\r\nwith the chariots and thus made the passage quite safe for Alexander;\r\nwho on reaching the bank discharged his horse-archers against the\r\nIndians in the chariots, and these were easily put to rout, many of\r\nthem being wounded. Other writers say that a battle took place between\r\nthe Indians who came with the son of Porus and Alexander at the head\r\nof his cavalry, that the son of Porus came with a greater force, that\r\nAlexander himself was wounded by him, and that his horse Bucephalas,\r\nof which he was exceedingly fond, was killed, being wounded, like his\r\nmaster by the son of Porus. But Ptolemy, son of Lagus, with whom I\r\nagree, gives a different account. This author also says that Porus\r\ndespatched his son, but not at the head of merely sixty chariots; nor\r\nis it indeed likely that Porus hearing from his scouts that either\r\nAlexander himself or at any rate a part of his army had effected the\r\npassage of the Hydaspes, would despatch his son against him with\r\nonly sixty chariots. These indeed were too many to be sent out as a\r\nreconnoitring party, and not adapted for speedy retreat; but they were\r\nby no means a sufficient force to keep back those of the enemy who had\r\nnot yet got across, as well as to attack those who had already landed.\r\nPtolemy says that the son of Porus arrived at the head of 2000 cavalry\r\nand 120 chariots; but that Alexander had already made even the last\r\npassage from the island before he appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENTS OF PORUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPtolemy also says that Alexander in the first place sent the\r\nhorse-archers against these, and led the cavalry himself, thinking\r\nthat Porus was approaching with all his forces, and that this body of\r\ncavalry was marching in front of the rest of his army, being drawn up\r\nby him as the vanguard. But as soon as he had ascertained with accuracy\r\nthe number of the Indians, he immediately made a rapid charge upon\r\nthem with the cavalry around him. When they perceived that Alexander\r\nhimself and the body of cavalry around him had made the assault, not\r\nin line of battle regularly formed, but by squadrons, they gave way;\r\nand 400 of their cavalry, including the son of Porus, fell in the\r\ncontest. The chariots also were captured, horses and all, being heavy\r\nand slow in the retreat, and useless in the action itself on account\r\nof the clayey ground. When the horsemen who had escaped from this rout\r\nbrought news to Porus that Alexander himself had crossed the river with\r\nthe strongest part of his army, and that his son had been slain in the\r\nbattle, he nevertheless could not make up his mind what course to take,\r\nbecause the men who had been left behind under Craterus were seen to be\r\nattempting to cross the river from the great camp which was directly\r\nopposite his position. However, at last he preferred to march against\r\nAlexander himself with all his army, and to come into a decisive\r\nconflict with the strongest division of the Macedonians, commanded by\r\nthe king in person. But nevertheless he left a few of the elephants\r\ntogether with a small army there at the camp to frighten the cavalry\r\nunder Craterus from the bank of the river. He then took all his cavalry\r\nto the number of 4,000 men, all his chariots to the number of 300, with\r\n200 of his elephants and 30,000 choice infantry, and marched against\r\nAlexander. When he found a place where he saw there was no clay, but\r\nthat on account of the sand the ground was all level and hard, and\r\nthus fit for the advance and retreat of horses, he there drew up his\r\narmy. First he placed the elephants in the front, each animal being not\r\nless than a plethrum[683] apart, so that they might be extended in the\r\nfront before the whole of the phalanx of infantry, and produce terror\r\neverywhere among Alexander’s cavalry. Besides he thought that none of\r\nthe enemy would have the audacity to push themselves into the spaces\r\nbetween the elephants, the cavalry being deterred by the fright of\r\ntheir horses; and still less would the infantry do so, it being likely\r\nthey would be kept off in front by the heavy-armed soldiers falling\r\nupon them, and trampled down by the elephants wheeling round against\r\nthem. Near these he had posted the infantry, not occupying a line on a\r\nlevel with the beasts, but in a second line behind them, only so far\r\ndistant that the companies of foot might be pushed forward a short\r\ndistance into the spaces between them. He had also bodies of infantry\r\nstanding beyond the elephants on the wings; and on both sides of the\r\ninfantry he had posted the cavalry, in front of which were placed the\r\nchariots on both wings of his army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S TACTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the arrangement which Porus made of his forces. As soon as\r\nAlexander observed that the Indians were drawn up in order of battle,\r\nhe stopped his cavalry from advancing farther, so that he might take\r\nup the infantry as it kept on arriving; and even when the phalanx in\r\nquick march had effected a junction with the cavalry, he did not at\r\nonce draw it out and lead it to the attack, not wishing to hand over\r\nhis men exhausted with fatigue and out of breath, to the barbarians\r\nwho were fresh and untired. On the contrary, he caused his infantry\r\nto rest until their strength was recruited, riding along round the\r\nlines to inspect them.[684] When he had surveyed the arrangement of\r\nthe Indians, he resolved not to advance against the centre, in front\r\nof which the elephants had been posted, and in the gaps between them a\r\ndense phalanx of men; for he was alarmed at the very arrangements which\r\nPorus had made here with that express design. But as he was superior\r\nin the number of his cavalry, he took the greater part of that force,\r\nand marched along against the left wing of the enemy for the purpose\r\nof making an attack in this direction. Against the right wing he sent\r\nCoenus with his own regiment of cavalry and that of Demetrius, with\r\ninstructions to keep close behind the barbarians when they, seeing the\r\ndense mass of cavalry opposed to them, should ride out to fight them.\r\nSeleucus, Antigenes, and Tauron were ordered to lead the phalanx of\r\ninfantry, but not to engage in the action until they observed[685]\r\nthe enemy’s cavalry and phalanx of infantry thrown into disorder by\r\nthe cavalry under his own command. But when they came within range of\r\nmissiles, he launched the horse-archers, 1000 in number, against the\r\nleft wing of the Indians, in order to throw those of the enemy who were\r\nposted there into confusion by the incessant storm of arrows and by the\r\ncharge of the horses. He himself with the Companion cavalry marched\r\nalong rapidly against the left wing of the barbarians, being eager to\r\nattack them in flank while still in a state of disorder, before their\r\ncavalry could be deployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF PORUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime the Indians had collected their cavalry from all parts, and\r\nwere riding along, advancing out of their position to meet Alexander’s\r\ncharge. Coenus also appeared with his men in their rear, according\r\nto his instructions. The Indians, observing this, were compelled to\r\nmake the line of their cavalry face both ways[686]; the largest and\r\nbest part against Alexander, while the rest wheeled round against\r\nCoenus and his forces. This therefore at once threw the ranks as well\r\nas the decisions of the Indians into confusion. Alexander, seeing\r\nhis opportunity, at the very moment the cavalry was wheeling round in\r\nthe other direction, made an attack on those opposed to him with such\r\nvigour that the Indians could not sustain the charge of his cavalry,\r\nbut were scattered and driven to the elephants, as to a friendly wall,\r\nfor refuge. Upon this, the drivers of the elephants urged forward\r\nthe beasts against the cavalry; but now the phalanx itself of the\r\nMacedonians was advancing against the elephants, the men casting darts\r\nat the riders and also striking the beasts themselves, standing round\r\nthem on all sides. The action was unlike any of the previous contests;\r\nfor wherever the beasts could wheel round, they rushed forth against\r\nthe ranks of infantry and demolished the phalanx of the Macedonians,\r\ndense as it was. The Indian cavalry also, seeing that the infantry\r\nwere engaged in the action, rallied again and advanced against the\r\nMacedonian cavalry. But when Alexander’s men, who far excelled both in\r\nstrength and military discipline, got the mastery over them the second\r\ntime, they were again repulsed towards the elephants and cooped up\r\namong them. By this time the whole of Alexander’s cavalry had collected\r\ninto one squadron, not by any command of his, but having settled\r\ninto this arrangement by the mere effect of the struggle itself; and\r\nwherever it fell upon the ranks of the Indians they were broken up\r\nwith great slaughter. The beasts being now cooped up into a narrow\r\nspace, their friends were no less injured by them than their foes,\r\nbeing trampled down in their wheeling and pushing about. Accordingly\r\nthere ensued a great slaughter of the cavalry, cooped up as it was in a\r\nnarrow space around the elephants. Most of the keepers of the elephants\r\nhad been killed by the javelins, and some of the elephants themselves\r\nhad been wounded, while others no longer kept apart in the battle on\r\naccount of their sufferings or from being destitute of keepers. But,\r\nas if frantic with pain, rushing forward at friends and foes alike,\r\nthey pushed about, trampled down and killed them in every kind of way.\r\nHowever, the Macedonians retired whenever they were assailed, for they\r\nrushed at the beasts in a more open space, and in accordance with their\r\nown plan; and when they wheeled round to return, they followed them\r\nclosely and hurled javelins at them; whereas the Indians retreating\r\namong them were now receiving greater injury from them. But when the\r\nbeasts were tired out, and they were no longer able to charge with any\r\nvigour, they began to retire, facing the foe like ships backing water,\r\nmerely uttering a shrill piping sound. Alexander himself surrounded\r\nthe whole line with his cavalry, and gave the signal that the infantry\r\nshould link their shields together so as to form a very densely closed\r\nbody, and thus advance in phalanx. By this means the Indian cavalry,\r\nwith the exception of a few men, was quite cut up in the action; as was\r\nalso the infantry, since the Macedonians were now pressing upon them\r\nfrom all sides. Upon this, all who could do so turned to flight through\r\nthe spaces which intervened between the parts of Alexander’s cavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nLOSSES OF THE COMBATANTS.—PORUS SURRENDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time Craterus and the other officers of Alexander’s army\r\nwho had been left behind on the bank of the Hydaspes crossed the\r\nriver, when they perceived that Alexander was winning a brilliant\r\nvictory. These men, being fresh, followed up the pursuit instead\r\nof Alexander’s exhausted troops, and made no less a slaughter of\r\nthe Indians in their retreat. Of the Indians little short of 20,000\r\ninfantry and 3,000 cavalry were killed in this battle.[687] All their\r\nchariots were broken to pieces; and two sons of Porus were slain, as\r\nwere also Spitaces, the governor of the Indians of that district, the\r\nmanagers of the elephants and of the chariots, and all the cavalry\r\nofficers and generals of Porus’s army. All the elephants which were\r\nnot killed there, were captured. Of Alexander’s forces, about 80 of\r\nthe 6,000 foot-soldiers who were engaged in the first attack, were\r\nkilled; 10 of the horse-archers, who were also the first to engage in\r\nthe action; about 20 of the Companion cavalry, and about 200 of the\r\nother horsemen fell.[688] When Porus, who exhibited great talent in\r\nthe battle, performing the deeds not only of a general but also of a\r\nvaliant soldier, observed the slaughter of his cavalry, and some of his\r\nelephants lying dead, others destitute of keepers straying about in a\r\nforlorn condition, while most of his infantry had perished, he did not\r\ndepart as Darius the Great King did, setting an example of flight to\r\nhis men; but as long as any body of Indians remained compact in the\r\nbattle, he kept up the struggle. But at last, having received a wound\r\non the right shoulder, which part of his body alone was unprotected\r\nduring the battle, he wheeled round. His coat of mail warded off the\r\nmissiles from the rest of his body, being extraordinary both for its\r\nstrength and the close fitting of its joints, as it was afterwards\r\npossible for those who saw him to observe. Then indeed he turned his\r\nelephant round and began to retire. Alexander, having seen that he was\r\na great man and valiant in the battle, was very desirous of saving his\r\nlife. He accordingly sent first to him Taxiles the Indian; who rode\r\nup as near to the elephant which was carrying Porus as seemed to him\r\nsafe, and bade him stop the beast, assuring him that it was no longer\r\npossible for him to flee, and bidding him listen to Alexander’s\r\nmessage. But when he saw his old foe Taxiles, he wheeled round and was\r\npreparing to strike him with a javelin; and he would probably have\r\nkilled him, if he had not quickly driven his horse forward out of\r\nthe reach of Porus before he could strike him. But not even on this\r\naccount was Alexander angry with Porus; but he kept on sending others\r\nin succession; and last of all Meroës an Indian, because he ascertained\r\nthat he was an old friend of Porus. As soon as the latter heard the\r\nmessage brought to him by Meroës, being at the same time overcome by\r\nthirst, he stopped his elephant and dismounted from it. After he had\r\ndrunk some water and felt refreshed, he ordered Meroës to lead him\r\nwithout delay to Alexander; and Meroës led him thither.[689]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nALLIANCE WITH PORUS.—DEATH OF BUCEPHALAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander heard that Meroës was bringing Porus to him, he rode\r\nin front of the line with a few of the Companions to meet Porus;\r\nand stopping his horse, he admired his handsome figure and his\r\nstature,[690] which reached somewhat above five cubits. He was also\r\nsurprised that he did not seem to be cowed in spirit,[691] but advanced\r\nto meet him as one brave man would meet another brave man, after having\r\ngallantly struggled in defence of his own kingdom against another king.\r\nThen indeed Alexander was the first to speak, bidding him say what\r\ntreatment he would like to receive. The report goes that Porus replied:\r\n“Treat me, O Alexander, in a kingly way!” Alexander being pleased at\r\nthe expression, said: “For my own sake, O Porus, thou shalt be thus\r\ntreated; but for thy own sake do thou demand what is pleasing to thee!”\r\nBut Porus said that everything was included in that. Alexander, being\r\nstill more pleased at this remark, not only granted him the rule over\r\nhis own Indians, but also added another country to that which he had\r\nbefore, of larger extent than the former.[692] Thus he treated the\r\nbrave man in a kingly way, and from that time found him faithful in\r\nall things. Such was the result of Alexander’s battle with Porus and\r\nthe Indians living beyond the river Hydaspes, which was fought in the\r\narchonship of Hegemon at Athens, in the month Munychion[693] (18 April\r\nto 18 May, 326 B.C.).\r\n\r\nAlexander founded two cities, one where the battle took place, and the\r\nother on the spot whence he started to cross the river Hydaspes; the\r\nformer he named Nicaea,[694] after his victory over the Indians, and\r\nthe latter Bucephala in memory of his horse Bucephalas, which died\r\nthere, not from having been wounded by any one, but from the effects of\r\ntoil and old age; for he was about thirty years old, and quite worn out\r\nwith toil.[695] This Bucephalas had shared many hardships and incurred\r\nmany dangers with Alexander during many years, being ridden by none but\r\nthe king, because he rejected all other riders. He was both of unusual\r\nsize and generous in mettle. The head of an ox had been engraved upon\r\nhim as a distinguishing mark, and according to some this was the reason\r\nwhy he bore that name; but others say, that though he was black he had\r\na white mark upon his head which bore a great resemblance to the head\r\nof an ox. In the land of the Uxians this horse vanished from Alexander,\r\nwho thereupon sent a proclamation throughout the country that he would\r\nkill all the inhabitants, unless they brought the horse back to him. As\r\na result of this proclamation it was immediately brought back. So great\r\nwas Alexander’s attachment to the horse, and so great was the fear of\r\nAlexander entertained by the barbarians.[696] Let so much honour be\r\npaid by me to this Bucephalas for the sake of his master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF THE GLAUSIANS.—EMBASSY FROM ABISARES.—PASSAGE OF THE\r\nACESINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander had paid all due honours to those who had been killed\r\nin the battle, he offered the customary sacrifices to the gods in\r\ngratitude for his victory, and celebrated a gymnastic and horse\r\ncontest upon the bank of the Hydaspes at the place where he first\r\ncrossed with his army.[697] He then left Craterus behind with a part\r\nof the army, to erect and fortify the cities which he was founding\r\nthere; but he himself marched against the Indians conterminous with\r\nthe dominion of Porus. According to Aristobulus the name of this\r\nnation was Glauganicians; but Ptolemy calls them Glausians. I am quite\r\nindifferent which name it bore. Alexander traversed their land with\r\nhalf the Companion cavalry, the picked men from each phalanx of the\r\ninfantry, all the horse-bowmen, the Agrianians, and the archers. All\r\nthe inhabitants came over to him on terms of capitulation; and he thus\r\ntook thirty-seven cities, the inhabitants of which, where they were\r\nfewest, amounted to no less than 5,000, and those of many numbered\r\nabove 10,000. He also took many villages, which were no less populous\r\nthan the cities. This land also he granted to Porus to rule; and sent\r\nTaxiles back to his own abode after affecting a reconciliation between\r\nhim and Porus. At this time arrived envoys from Abisares,[698] who told\r\nhim that their king was ready to surrender himself and the land which\r\nhe ruled. And yet before the battle which was fought between Alexander\r\nand Porus, Abisares intended to join his forces with those of the\r\nlatter. On this occasion he sent his brother with the other envoys to\r\nAlexander, taking with them money and forty elephants as a gift. Envoys\r\nalso arrived from the independent Indians, and from a certain other\r\nIndian ruler named Porus.[699] Alexander ordered Abisares to come to\r\nhim as soon as possible, threatening that unless he came he would see\r\nhim arrive with his army at a place where he would not rejoice to see\r\nhim. At this time Phrataphernes, viceroy of Parthia and Hyrcania, came\r\nto Alexander at the head of the Thracians who had been left with him.\r\nMessengers also came from Sisicottus, viceroy of the Assacenians, to\r\ninform him that those people had slain their governor and revolted from\r\nAlexander. Against these he despatched Philip and Tyriaspes with an\r\narmy, to arrange and set in order the affairs of their land.\r\n\r\nHe himself advanced towards the river Acesines.[700] Ptolemy, son of\r\nLagus, has described the size of this river alone of those in India,\r\nstating that where Alexander crossed it with his army upon boats and\r\nskins, the stream was rapid and the channel was full of large and sharp\r\nrocks, over which the water being violently carried seethed and dashed.\r\nHe says also that its breadth amounted to fifteen stades; that those\r\nwho went over upon skins had an easy passage; but that not a few of\r\nthose who crossed in the boats perished there in the water, many of\r\nthe boats being wrecked upon the rocks and dashed to pieces. From this\r\ndescription then it would be possible for one to come to a conclusion\r\nby comparison, that the size of the river Indus has been stated not\r\nfar from the fact by those who think that its mean breadth is forty\r\nstades, but that it contracts to fifteen stades where it is narrowest\r\nand therefore deepest; and that this is the width of the Indus in many\r\nplaces. I come then to the conclusion that Alexander chose a part of\r\nthe Acesines where the passage was widest, so that he might find the\r\nstream slower than elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nADVANCE BEYOND THE HYDRAOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the river,[701] he left Coenus with his own brigade\r\nthere upon the bank, with instructions to superintend the passage of\r\nthe part of the army which had been left behind for the purpose of\r\ncollecting[702] corn and other supplies from the country of the Indians\r\nwhich was already subject to him. He now sent Porus away to his own\r\nabode, commanding him to select the most warlike of the Indians and\r\ntake all the elephants he had and come to him. He resolved to pursue\r\nthe other Porus, the bad one, with the lightest troops in his army,\r\nbecause he was informed that he had left the land which he ruled and\r\nhad fled. For this Porus, while hostilities subsisted between Alexander\r\nand the other Porus, sent envoys to Alexander offering to surrender\r\nboth himself and the land subject to him, rather out of enmity to Porus\r\nthan from friendship to Alexander. But when he ascertained that the\r\nformer had been released, and that he was ruling over another large\r\ncountry in addition to his own, then, fearing not so much Alexander as\r\nthe other Porus, his namesake, he fled from his own land, taking with\r\nhim as many of his warriors as he could persuade to share his flight.\r\nAgainst this man Alexander marched, and arrived at the Hydraotes,[703]\r\nwhich is another Indian river, not less than the Acesines in breadth,\r\nbut less in swiftness of current. He traversed the whole country as far\r\nas the Hydraotes, leaving garrisons in the most suitable places, in\r\norder that Craterus and Coenus might advance with safety, scouring most\r\nof the land for forage. Then he despatched Hephaestion into the land of\r\nthe Porus who had revolted, giving him a part of the army, comprising\r\ntwo brigades of infantry, his own regiment of cavalry with that of\r\nDemetrius and half of the archers, with instructions to hand the\r\ncountry over to the other Porus, to subdue any independent tribes of\r\nIndians which dwelt near the banks of the river Hydraotes, and to give\r\nthem also into the hands of Porus to rule. He himself then crossed the\r\nriver Hydraotes, not with difficulty, as he had crossed the Acesines.\r\nAs he was advancing into the country beyond the Hydraotes, it happened\r\nthat most of the people yielded themselves up on terms of capitulation;\r\nbut some came to meet him with arms, while others who tried to escape\r\nhe captured and forcibly reduced to obedience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nINVASION OF THE LAND OF THE CATHAEANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime he received information that the tribe called Cathaeans\r\nand some other tribes of the independent Indians were preparing for\r\nbattle, if he approached their land; and that they were summoning to\r\nthe enterprise all the tribes conterminous with them who were in like\r\nmanner independent. He was also informed that the city, Sangala by\r\nname,[704] near which they were thinking of having the struggle, was\r\na strong one. The Cathaeans themselves were considered very daring\r\nand skilful in war; and two other tribes of Indians, the Oxydracians\r\nand Mallians, were in the same temper as the Cathaeans. For a short\r\ntime before it happened that Porus and Abisares had marched against\r\nthem with their own forces and had roused many other tribes of the\r\nindependent Indians to arms, but were forced to retreat without\r\neffecting anything worthy of the preparations they had made. When\r\nAlexander was informed of this, he made a forced march against the\r\nCathaeans, and on the second day after starting from the river\r\nHydraotes he arrived at a city called Pimprama, inhabited by a\r\ntribe of Indians named Adraistaeans, who yielded to him on terms of\r\ncapitulation. Giving his army a rest the next day, he advanced on the\r\nthird day to Sangala, where the Cathaeans and the other neighbouring\r\ntribes had assembled and marshalled themselves in front of the city\r\nupon a hill which was not precipitous on all sides. They had posted\r\ntheir waggons all round this hill and were encamping within them in\r\nsuch a way that they were surrounded by a triple palisade of waggons.\r\nWhen Alexander perceived the great number of the barbarians and the\r\nnature of their position, he drew up his forces in the order which\r\nseemed to him especially adapted to his present circumstances, and sent\r\nhis horse-archers at once without any delay against them, ordering\r\nthem to ride along and shoot at them from a distance; so that the\r\nIndians might not be able to make any sortie, before his army was in\r\nproper array, and that even before the battle commenced they might be\r\nwounded within their stronghold. Upon the right wing he posted the\r\nguard of cavalry and the cavalry regiment of Clitus; next to these\r\nthe shield-bearing guards, and then the Agrianians. Towards the left\r\nhe had stationed Perdiccas with his own regiment of cavalry, and the\r\nbattalions of foot Companions. The archers he divided into two parts\r\nand placed them on each wing. While he was marshalling his army, the\r\ninfantry and cavalry of the rear-guard came up. Of these, he divided\r\nthe cavalry into two parts and led them to the wings, and with the\r\ninfantry which came up he made the ranks of the phalanx more dense and\r\ncompact. He then took the cavalry which had been drawn up on the right,\r\nand led it towards the waggons on the left wing of the Indians; for\r\nhere their position seemed to him more easy to assail, and the waggons\r\nhad not been placed together so densely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nASSAULT UPON SANGALA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Indians did not run out from behind the waggons against the\r\nadvancing cavalry, but mounted upon them and began to shoot from\r\nthe top of them, Alexander, perceiving that it was not the work for\r\ncavalry, leaped down from his horse, and on foot led the phalanx of\r\ninfantry against them. The Macedonians without difficulty forced the\r\nIndians from the first row of waggons; but then the Indians, taking\r\ntheir stand in front of the second row, more easily repulsed the\r\nattack, because they were posted in denser array in a smaller circle.\r\nMoreover the Macedonians were attacking them likewise in a confined\r\nspace, while the Indians were secretly creeping under the front row\r\nof waggons, and without regard to discipline were assaulting their\r\nenemy through the gaps left between the waggons as each man found a\r\nchance.[705] But nevertheless even from these the Indians were forcibly\r\ndriven by the phalanx of infantry. They no longer made a stand at\r\nthe third row, but fled as fast as possible into the city and shut\r\nthemselves up in it. During that day Alexander with his infantry\r\nencamped round the city, as much of it, at least, as his phalanx\r\ncould surround; for he could not with his camp completely encircle\r\nthe wall, so extensive was it. Opposite the part unenclosed by his\r\ncamp, near which also was a lake, he posted the cavalry, placing them\r\nall round the lake, which he discovered to be shallow. Moreover, he\r\nconjectured that the Indians, being terrified at their previous defeat,\r\nwould abandon the city in the night; and it turned out just as he had\r\nconjectured; for about the second watch of the night most of them\r\ndropped down from the wall, but fell in with[706] the sentinels of\r\ncavalry. The foremost of them were cut to pieces by these; but the men\r\nbehind them perceiving that the lake was guarded all round, withdrew\r\ninto the city again. Alexander now surrounded the city with a double\r\nstockade, except in the part where the lake shut it in, and round the\r\nlake he posted more perfect guards. He also resolved to bring military\r\nengines up to the wall, to batter it down. But some of the men in the\r\ncity deserted to him, and told him that the Indians intended that very\r\nnight to steal out of the city and escape by the lake, where the gap in\r\nthe stockade existed. He accordingly stationed Ptolemy, son of Lagus,\r\nthere, giving him three regiments of the shield-bearing guards, all\r\nthe Agrianians, and one line of archers, pointing out to him the place\r\nwhere he especially conjectured the barbarians would try to force their\r\nway. “When thou perceivest the barbarians forcing their way here,”\r\nsaid he, “do thou, with the army obstruct their advance, and order\r\nthe bugler to give the signal. And do you, O officers, as soon as the\r\nsignal has been given, each being arrayed in battle order with your own\r\nmen, advance towards the noise, wherever the bugle summons you. Nor\r\nwill I myself withdraw from the action.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF SANGALA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the orders he gave; and Ptolemy collected there as many\r\nwaggons as he could from those which had been left behind in the first\r\nflight, and placed them athwart, so that there might seem to the\r\nfugitives in the night to be many difficulties in their way; and as\r\nthe stockade had been knocked down, or had not been firmly fixed in\r\nthe ground, he ordered his men to heap up a mound of earth in various\r\nplaces between the lake and the wall. This his soldiers effected in\r\nthe night. When it was about the fourth watch,[707] the barbarians,\r\njust as Alexander had been informed, opened the gates towards the\r\nlake, and made a run in that direction. However they did not escape\r\nthe notice of the guards there, nor that of Ptolemy, who had been\r\nplaced behind them to render aid. But at this moment the buglers gave\r\nhim the signal, and he advanced against the barbarians with his army\r\nfully equipped and drawn up in battle array. Moreover the waggons and\r\nthe stockade which had been placed in the intervening space, were an\r\nobstruction to them. When the bugle sounded and Ptolemy attacked them,\r\nkilling the men as they kept on stealing out through the waggons, then\r\nindeed they were driven back again into the city; and in their retreat\r\n500 of them were killed. In the meanwhile Porus arrived, bringing with\r\nhim the elephants that were left to him, and 5,000 Indians. Alexander\r\nhad constructed his military engines and they were being led up to the\r\nwall; but before any of it was battered down, the Macedonians took the\r\ncity by storm, digging under the wall, which was made of brick, and\r\nplacing scaling ladders against it all round. In the capture 17,000 of\r\nthe Indians were killed, and above 70,000 were captured, besides 300\r\nchariots and 500 cavalry. In the whole siege a little less than 100 of\r\nAlexander’s army were killed; but the number of the wounded was greater\r\nthan the proportion of the slain, being more than 1,200, among whom\r\nwere Lysimachus, the confidential body-guard, and other officers. After\r\nburying the dead according to his custom, Alexander sent Eumenes, the\r\nsecretary,[708] with 300 cavalry to the two cities which had joined\r\nSangala in revolt, to tell those who held them about the capture of\r\nSangala, and to inform them that they would receive no harsh treatment\r\nfrom Alexander if they stayed there and received him as a friend; for\r\nno harm had happened to any of the other independent Indians who had\r\nsurrendered to him of their own accord. But they had become frightened,\r\nand had abandoned the cities and were fleeing; for the news had already\r\nreached them that Alexander had taken Sangala by storm. When Alexander\r\nwas informed of their flight he pursued them with speed; but most of\r\nthem were too quick for him, and effected their escape, because the\r\npursuit began from a distant starting-place. But all those who were\r\nleft behind in the retreat from weakness, were seized by the army and\r\nkilled, to the number of about 500. Then, giving up the design of\r\npursuing the fugitives any further, he returned to Sangala, and razed\r\nthe city to the ground. He added the land to that of the Indians who\r\nhad formerly been independent, but who had then voluntarily submitted\r\nto him. He then sent Porus with his forces to the cities which had\r\nsubmitted to him, to introduce garrisons into them; whilst he himself,\r\nwith his army, advanced to the river Hyphasis,[709] to subjugate the\r\nIndians beyond it. Nor did there seem to him any end of the war, so\r\nlong as anything hostile to him remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY REFUSES TO ADVANCE.—ALEXANDER’S SPEECH TO THE OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was reported that the country beyond the river Hyphasis was fertile,\r\nand that the men were good agriculturists, and gallant in war; and\r\nthat they conducted their own political affairs in a regular and\r\nconstitutional manner. For the multitude was ruled by the aristocracy,\r\nwho governed in no respect contrary to the rules of moderation. It was\r\nalso stated that the men of that district possessed a much greater\r\nnumber of elephants than the other Indians, and that those men were\r\nof very great stature, and excelled in valour. These reports excited\r\nin Alexander an ardent desire to advance farther; but the spirit of\r\nthe Macedonians now began to flag, when they saw the king raising\r\none labour after another, and incurring one danger after another.\r\nConferences were held throughout the camp, in which those who were the\r\nmost moderate bewailed their lot, while others resolutely declared that\r\nthey would not follow Alexander any farther, even if he should lead\r\nthe way. When he heard of this, before the disorder and pusillanimity\r\nof the soldiers should advance to a great degree, he called a council\r\nof the officers of the brigades and addressed them as follows:—“O\r\nMacedonians and Grecian allies, seeing that you no longer follow me\r\ninto dangerous enterprises with a resolution equal to that which\r\nformerly animated you, I have collected you together into the same\r\nspot, so that I may either persuade you to march forward with me, or\r\nmay be persuaded by you to return. If indeed the labours which you\r\nhave already undergone up to our present position seem to you worthy\r\nof disapprobation, and if you do not approve of my leading you into\r\nthem, there can be no advantage in my speaking any further. But, if as\r\nthe result of these labours, you hold possession of Ionia,[710] the\r\nHellespont, both the Phrygias, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Lydia, Caria,\r\nLycia, Pamphylia, Phoenicia, Egypt together with Grecian Libya, as\r\nwell as part of Arabia, Hollow Syria, Syria between the rivers,[711]\r\nBabylon, the nation of the Susians, Persia, Media, besides all the\r\nnations which the Persians and the Medes ruled, and many of those which\r\nthey did not rule, the land beyond the Caspian Gates, the country\r\nbeyond the Caucasus, the Tanais, as well as the land beyond that river,\r\nBactria, Hyrcania, and the Hyrcanian Sea; if we have also subdued\r\nthe Scythians as far as the desert; if, in addition to these, the\r\nriver Indus flows through our territory, as do also the Hydaspes, the\r\nAcesines, and the Hydraotes, why do ye shrink from adding the Hyphasis\r\nalso, and the nations beyond this river, to your empire of Macedonia?\r\nDo ye fear that your advance will be stopped in the future by any other\r\nbarbarians? Of whom some submit to us of their own accord, and others\r\nare captured in the act of fleeing, while others, succeeding in their\r\nefforts to escape, hand over to us their deserted land, which we add to\r\nthat of our allies, or to that of those who have voluntarily submitted\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S SPEECH (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n“I, for my part, think, that to a brave man there is no end to labours\r\nexcept the labours themselves, provided they lead to glorious\r\nachievements. But if any one desires to hear what will be the end to\r\nthe warfare itself, let him learn that the distance still remaining\r\nbefore we reach the river Ganges and the Eastern Sea is not great; and\r\nI inform you that the Hyrcanian Sea will be seen to be united with\r\nthis, because the Great Sea encircles the whole earth. I will also\r\ndemonstrate both to the Macedonians and to the Grecian allies, that the\r\nIndian Gulf is confluent with the Persian, and the Hyrcanian Sea with\r\nthe Indian Gulf. From the Persian Gulf our expedition will sail round\r\ninto Libya as far as the Pillars of Heracles.[712] From the pillars all\r\nthe interior of Libya[713] becomes ours, and so the whole of Asia[714]\r\nwill belong to us, and the limits of our empire, in that direction,\r\nwill be those which God has made also the limits of the earth. But, if\r\nwe now return, many warlike nations are left unconquered beyond the\r\nHyphasis as far as the Eastern Sea, and many besides between these and\r\nHyrcania in the direction of the north wind, and not far from these the\r\nScythian races. Wherefore, if we go back, there is reason to fear that\r\nthe races which are now held in subjection, not being firm in their\r\nallegiance, may be excited to revolt by those who are not yet subdued.\r\nThen our many labours will prove to have been in vain; or it will be\r\nnecessary for us to incur over again fresh labours and dangers, as\r\nat the beginning. But, O Macedonians and Grecian allies, stand firm!\r\nGlorious are the deeds of those who undergo labour and run the risk\r\nof danger; and it is delightful to live a life of valour and to die\r\nleaving behind immortal glory. Do ye not know that our ancestor[715]\r\nreached so great a height of glory as from being a man to become a god,\r\nor to seem to become one, not by remaining in Tiryns[716] or Argos, or\r\neven in the Peloponnese or at Thebes? The labours of Dionysus were not\r\nfew, and he was too exalted a deity to be compared with Heracles. But\r\nwe, indeed, have penetrated into regions beyond Nysa[717]; and the rock\r\nof Aornus, which Heracles was unable to capture, is in our possession.\r\nDo ye also add the parts of Asia still left unsubdued to those already\r\nacquired, the few to the many. But what great or glorious deed could\r\nwe have performed, if, sitting at ease in Macedonia, we had thought\r\nit sufficient to preserve our own country without any labour, simply\r\nrepelling the attacks of the nations on our frontiers, the Thracians,\r\nIllyrians, and Triballians, or even those Greeks who were unfriendly\r\nto our interests? If, indeed, without undergoing labour and being free\r\nfrom danger I were acting as your commander, while you were undergoing\r\nlabour and incurring danger, not without reason would you be growing\r\nfaint in spirit and resolution, because you alone would be sharing\r\nthe labours, while procuring the rewards of them for others. But now\r\nthe labours are common to you and me, we have an equal share of the\r\ndangers, and the rewards are open to the free competition of all. For\r\nthe land is yours, and you act as its viceroys. The greater part also\r\nof the money now comes to you; and when we have traversed the whole of\r\nAsia, then, by Zeus, not merely having satisfied your expectations, but\r\nhaving even exceeded the advantages which each man hopes to receive,\r\nthose of you who wish to return home I will send back to their own\r\nland, or I will myself lead them back; while those who remain here, I\r\nwill make objects of envy to those who go back.”[718]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER OF COENUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander had uttered these remarks, and others in the same\r\nstrain, a long silence ensued, for the auditors neither had the\r\naudacity to speak in opposition to the king without constraint, nor did\r\nthey wish to acquiesce in his proposal. Hereupon, he repeatedly urged\r\nany one who wished it, to speak, if he entertained different views\r\nfrom those which he had himself expressed. Nevertheless the silence\r\nstill continued a long time; but at last, Coenus, son of Polemocrates,\r\nplucked up courage and spoke as follows[719]:—“O king, inasmuch as\r\nthou dost not wish to rule Macedonians by compulsion, but sayest thou\r\nwilt lead them by persuasion, or yielding to their persuasion wilt not\r\nuse violence towards them, I am going to make a speech, not on my own\r\nbehalf and that of my colleagues here present, who are held in greater\r\nhonour than the other soldiers, and most of us have already carried off\r\nthe rewards of our labours, and from our pre-eminence are more zealous\r\nthan the rest to serve thee in all things; but I am going to speak on\r\nbehalf of the bulk of the army. On behalf of this army I am not going\r\nto say what may be gratifying to the men, but what I consider to be\r\nboth advantageous to thee at present, and safest for the future. I feel\r\nit incumbent upon me not to conceal what I think the best course to\r\npursue, both on account of my age, the honour paid to me by the rest\r\nof the army at thy behest, and the boldness which I have without any\r\nhesitation displayed up to the present time in incurring dangers and\r\nundergoing labours. The more numerous and the greater the exploits\r\nhave been, which were achieved by thee as our commander, and by those\r\nwho started from home with thee, the more advantageous does it seem to\r\nme that some end should be put to our labours and dangers. For thou\r\nthyself seest how many Macedonians and Greeks started with thee, and\r\nhow few of us have been left. Of our number thou didst well in sending\r\nback home the Thessalians at once from Bactra, because thou didst\r\nperceive that they were no longer eager to undergo labours.[720] Of the\r\nother Greeks, some have been settled as colonists in the cities which\r\nthou hast founded; where they remain not indeed all of them of their\r\nown free will. The Macedonian soldiers and the other Greeks who still\r\ncontinued to share our labours and dangers, have either perished in\r\nthe battles, become unfit for war on account of their wounds, or been\r\nleft behind in the different parts of Asia. The majority, however, have\r\nperished from disease, so that few are left out of many; and these few\r\nare no longer equally vigorous in body, while in spirit they are much\r\nmore exhausted. All those whose parents still survive, feel a great\r\nyearning to see them once more; they feel a yearning after their wives\r\nand children, and a yearning for their native land itself; which it is\r\nsurely pardonable for them to yearn to see again with the honour and\r\ndignity they have acquired from thee, returning as great men, whereas\r\nthey departed small, and as rich men instead of being poor. Do not\r\nlead us now against our will; for thou wilt no longer find us the same\r\nmen in regard to dangers, since free-will will be wanting to us in\r\nthe contests. But, rather, if it seem good to thee, return to thy own\r\nland, see thy mother, regulate the affairs of the Greeks, and carry to\r\nthe home of thy fathers these victories so many and great. Then start\r\nafresh on another expedition, if thou wishest, against these very\r\ntribes of Indians situated towards the east; or, if thou wishest, into\r\nthe Euxine Sea[721]; or else against Carchedon and the parts of Libya\r\nbeyond the Carchedonians.[722] It is now thy business to manage these\r\nmatters; and the other Macedonians and Greeks will follow thee, young\r\nmen in place of old, fresh men in place of exhausted ones, and men to\r\nwhom warfare has no terrors, because up to the present time they have\r\nhad no experience of it; and they will be eager to set out, from hope\r\nof future reward. The probability also is, that they will accompany\r\nthee with still more zeal on this account, when they see that those who\r\nin the earlier expedition shared thy labours and dangers have returned\r\nto their own abodes as rich men instead of being poor, and renowned\r\ninstead of being obscure as they were before. Self-control in the midst\r\nof success is the noblest of all virtues, O king! For thou hast nothing\r\nto fear from enemies, while thou art commanding and leading such an\r\narmy as this; but the visitations of the deity are unexpected, and\r\nconsequently men can take no precautions against them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RESOLVES TO RETURN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Coenus had concluded this speech, loud applause was given to his\r\nwords by those who were present; and the fact that many even shed\r\ntears, made it still more evident that they were disinclined to incur\r\nfurther hazards, and that return would be delightful to them. Alexander\r\nthen broke up the conference, being annoyed at the freedom of speech\r\nin which Coenus indulged, and the hesitation displayed by the other\r\nofficers. But the next day he called the same men together again in\r\nwrath, and told them that he intended to advance farther, but would\r\nnot force any Macedonian to accompany him against his will; that he\r\nwould have those only who followed their king of their own accord; and\r\nthat those who wished to return home were at liberty to return and\r\ncarry back word to their relations that they were come back, having\r\ndeserted their king in the midst of his enemies. Having said this, he\r\nretired into his tent, and did not admit any of the Companions on that\r\nday, or until the third day from that, waiting to see if any change\r\nwould occur in the minds of the Macedonians and Grecian allies, as is\r\nwont to happen, as a general rule among a crowd of soldiers, rendering\r\nthem more disposed to obey. But on the contrary, when there was a\r\nprofound silence throughout the camp, and the soldiers were evidently\r\nannoyed at his wrath, without being at all changed by it, Ptolemy, son\r\nof Lagus, says that he none the less offered sacrifice there for the\r\npassage of the river, but the victims were unfavourable to him when he\r\nsacrificed. Then indeed he collected the oldest of the Companions and\r\nespecially those who were friendly to him, and as all things indicated\r\nthe advisability of returning, he made known to the army that he had\r\nresolved to march back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RECROSSES THE HYDRAOTES AND ACESINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen they shouted as a mixed multitude would shout when rejoicing;\r\nand most of them shed tears of joy. Some of them even approached the\r\nroyal tent, and prayed for many blessings upon Alexander; because by\r\nthem alone he suffered himself to be conquered. Then he divided the\r\narmy into brigades, and ordered twelve altars to be prepared, equal in\r\nheight to very large towers, and in breadth much larger than towers,\r\nto serve as thank-offerings to the gods who had led him so far as a\r\nconqueror, and also to serve as monuments of his own labours.[723] When\r\nthe altars were completed, he offered sacrifice upon them according to\r\nhis custom, and celebrated a gymnastic and equestrian contest. After\r\nadding the country as far as the river Hyphasis to the dominion of\r\nPorus, he marched back to the Hydraotes. Having crossed this river, he\r\ncontinued his return march to the Acesines, where he found the city\r\nwhich Hephaestion had been ordered to fortify, quite built. In this\r\ncity he settled as many of the neighbouring people as volunteered\r\nto live in it, as well as those of the Grecian mercenaries who were\r\nnow unfit for military service; and then began to make the necessary\r\npreparations for a voyage down the river into the Great Sea. At this\r\ntime Arsaces, the ruler of the land bordering on that of Abisares, and\r\nthe brother of the latter, with his other relations, came to Alexander,\r\nbringing the gifts which are reckoned most valuable among the Indians,\r\nincluding some elephants from Abisares, thirty in number. They declared\r\nthat Abisares himself was unable to come on account of illness; and\r\nwith these men the ambassadors sent by Alexander to Abisares agreed.\r\nReadily believing that such was the case, he granted that prince the\r\nprivilege of ruling his own country as his viceroy, and placed Arsaces\r\nalso under his power. After arranging what tribute they were to pay, he\r\nagain offered sacrifice near the river Acesines. He then crossed that\r\nriver again, and came to the Hydaspes, where he employed the army in\r\nrepairing the damage caused to the cities of Nicaea and Bucephala by\r\nthe rain, and put the other affairs of the country in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR A VOYAGE DOWN THE INDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander now resolved to sail down the Hydaspes to the Great Sea,\r\nafter he had prepared on the banks of that river many thirty-oared\r\ngalleys and others with one and a half bank of oars, as well as a\r\nnumber of vessels for conveying horses, and all the other things\r\nrequisite for the easy conveyance of an army on a river. At first\r\nhe thought he had discovered the origin of the Nile, when he saw\r\ncrocodiles in the river Indus, which he had seen in no other river\r\nexcept the Nile,[724] as well as beans growing near the banks of\r\nthe Acesines of the same kind as those which the Egyptian land\r\nproduces.[725] This conjecture was confirmed when he heard that the\r\nAcesines falls into the Indus. He thought the Nile rises somewhere or\r\nother in India, and after flowing through an extensive tract of desert\r\ncountry loses the name of Indus there; but afterwards when it begins to\r\nflow again through the inhabited land, it is called Nile both by the\r\nAethiopians of that district and by the Egyptians, and finally empties\r\nitself into the Inner Sea.[726] In like manner Homer made the river\r\nEgypt give its name to the country of Egypt.[727] Accordingly when he\r\nwrote to Olympias about the country of India, after mentioning other\r\nthings, he said that he thought he had discovered the sources of the\r\nNile, forming his conclusions about things so great from such small and\r\ntrivial premisses. However, when he had made a more careful inquiry\r\ninto the facts relating to the river Indus, he learned the following\r\ndetails from the natives:—That the Hydaspes unites its water with\r\nthe Acesines, as the latter does with the Indus, and that they both\r\nyield up their names to the Indus; that the last-named river has two\r\nmouths, through which it discharges itself into the Great Sea; but that\r\nit has no connection with the Egyptian country. He then removed from\r\nthe letter to his mother the part he had written about the Nile.[728]\r\nPlanning a voyage down the rivers as far as the Great Sea, he ordered\r\nships for this purpose to be prepared for him. The crews of his ships\r\nwere fully supplied from the Phoenicians, Cyprians, Carians, and\r\nEgyptians who accompanied the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE DOWN THE HYDASPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Coenus, who was one of Alexander’s most faithful\r\nCompanions, fell ill and died, and the king buried him with as much\r\nmagnificence as circumstances allowed. Then collecting the Companions\r\nand the Indian envoys who had come to him, he appointed Porus king of\r\nthe part of India which had already been conquered, seven nations\r\nin all, containing more than 2,000 cities. After this he made the\r\nfollowing distribution of his army.[729] With himself he placed on\r\nboard the ships all the shield-bearing guards, the archers, the\r\nAgrianians, and the body-guard of cavalry.[730] Craterus led a part\r\nof the infantry and cavalry along the right bank of the Hydaspes,\r\nwhile along the other bank Hephaestion advanced at the head of the\r\nmost numerous and efficient part of the army, including the elephants,\r\nwhich now numbered about 200. These generals were ordered to march\r\nas quickly as possible to the place where the palace of Sopeithes\r\nwas situated,[731] and Philip, the viceroy of the country beyond the\r\nIndus[732] extending to Bactria, was ordered to follow them with his\r\nforces after an interval of three days. He sent the Nysaean cavalry\r\nback to Nysa.[733] The whole of the naval force was under the command\r\nof Nearchus; but the pilot of Alexander’s ship was Onesicritus,\r\nwho, in the narrative which he composed of Alexander’s campaigns,\r\nfalsely asserted that he was admiral, while in reality he was only\r\na pilot.[734] According to Ptolemy, son of Lagus, whose statements\r\nI chiefly follow, the entire number of the ships was about eighty\r\nthirty-oared galleys; but the whole number of vessels, including the\r\nhorse transports and boats, and all the other river craft, both those\r\npreviously plying on the rivers and those built at that time, fell not\r\nfar short of 2,000.[735]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE DOWN THE HYDASPES (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he had made all the necessary preparations the army began to\r\nembark at the approach of the dawn; while according to custom he\r\noffered sacrifice to the gods and to the river Hydaspes, as the\r\nprophets directed.[736] When he had embarked he poured a libation into\r\nthe river from the prow of the ship out of a golden goblet, invoking\r\nthe Acesines as well as the Hydaspes, because he had ascertained that\r\nit is the largest of all the rivers which unite with the Hydaspes, and\r\nthat their confluence was not far off. He also invoked the Indus, into\r\nwhich the Acesines flows after its junction with the Hydaspes. Moreover\r\nhe poured out libations to his forefather Heracles, to Ammon,[737]\r\nand the other gods to whom he was in the habit of sacrificing, and\r\nthen he ordered the signal for starting seawards to be given with the\r\ntrumpet. As soon as the signal was given they commenced the voyage in\r\nregular order; for directions had been given at what distance apart\r\nit was necessary for the baggage vessels to be arranged, as also for\r\nthe vessels conveying the horses and for the ships of war; so that\r\nthey might not fall foul of each other by sailing down the channel at\r\nrandom. He did not allow even the fast-sailing ships to get out of rank\r\nby outstripping the rest. The noise of the rowing was never equalled on\r\nany other occasion, inasmuch as it proceeded from so many ships rowed\r\nat the same time; also the shouting of the boatswains giving the time\r\nfor beginning and stopping the stroke of the oars, and the clamour of\r\nthe rowers, when keeping time all together with the dashing of the\r\noars, made a noise like a battle-cry. The banks of the river also,\r\nbeing in many places higher than the ships, and collecting the sound\r\ninto a narrow space, sent back to each other an echo which was very\r\nmuch increased by its very compression. In some parts too the groves\r\nof trees on each side of the river helped to swell the sound, both\r\nfrom the solitude and the reverberation of the noise. The horses which\r\nwere visible on the decks of the transports struck the barbarians who\r\nsaw them with such surprise that those of them who were present at\r\nthe starting of the fleet accompanied it a long way from the place of\r\nembarkation. For horses had never before been seen on board ships in\r\nthe country of India; and the natives did not call to mind that the\r\nexpedition of Dionysus into India was a naval one. The shouting of the\r\nrowers and the noise of the rowing were heard by the Indians who had\r\nalready submitted to Alexander, and these came running down to the\r\nriver’s bank and accompanied him singing their native songs. For the\r\nIndians have been eminently fond of singing and dancing since the time\r\nof Dionysus and those who under his bacchic inspiration traversed the\r\nland of the Indians with him.[738]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE DOWN THE HYDASPES INTO THE ACESINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSailing thus, he stopped on the third day at the spot where he had\r\ninstructed Hephaestion and Craterus to encamp on opposite banks of\r\nthe river at the same place. Here he remained two days, until Philip\r\nwith the rest of the army came up with him. He then sent this general\r\nwith the men he brought with him to the river Acesines, with orders\r\nto march along the bank of that river. He also sent Craterus and\r\nHephaestion off again with instructions how they were to conduct the\r\nmarch. But he himself continued his voyage down the river Hydaspes,\r\nthe channel of which is nowhere less than twenty stades broad. Mooring\r\nhis vessels near the banks wherever he could, he received some of the\r\nIndians dwelling near into allegiance by their voluntary surrender,\r\nwhile he reduced by force those who came into a trial of strength\r\nwith him. Then he sailed rapidly towards the country of the Mallians\r\nand Oxydracians, having ascertained that these tribes were the most\r\nnumerous and the most warlike of the Indians in that region; and\r\nhaving been informed that they had put their wives and children for\r\nsafety into their strongest cities, with the resolution of fighting\r\na battle with him, he made the voyage with the greater speed with\r\nthe express design of attacking them before they had arranged their\r\nplans, and while there was still lack of preparation and a state of\r\nconfusion among them. Thence he made his second start, and on the\r\nfifth day reached the junction of the Hydaspes and Acesines. Where\r\nthese rivers unite, one very narrow river is formed out of the two;\r\nand on account of its narrowness the current is swift. There are also\r\nprodigious eddies in the whirling stream, and the water rises in waves\r\nand plashes exceedingly, so that the noise of the swell of waters is\r\ndistinctly heard by people while they are still far off. These things\r\nhad previously been reported to Alexander by the natives, and he had\r\ntold his soldiers; and yet, when his army approached the junction\r\nof the rivers, the noise made by the stream produced so great an\r\nimpression upon them that the sailors stopped rowing, not from any word\r\nof command, but because the very boatswains who gave the time to the\r\nrowers became silent from astonishment and stood aghast at the noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE DOWN THE ACESINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they came near the junction of the rivers, the pilots passed on\r\nthe order that the men should row as hard as possible to get out of\r\nthe narrows, so that the ships might not fall into the eddies and be\r\noverturned by them, but might by the vigorous rowing overcome the\r\nwhirlings of the water. Being of a round form, the merchant vessels\r\nwhich happened to be whirled round by the current received no damage\r\nfrom the eddy, but the men who were on board were thrown into disorder\r\nand fright. For being kept upright by the force of the stream itself,\r\nthese vessels settled again into the onward course. But the ships\r\nof war, being long, did not emerge so scatheless from the whirling\r\ncurrent, not being raised aloft in the same way as the others upon\r\nthe plashing swell of water. These ships had two ranks of oars on\r\neach side, the lower oars being only a little out of the water. These\r\nvessels getting athwart in the eddies, their oars could not be raised\r\naloft in proper time and were consequently caught by the water and came\r\ninto collision with each other. Thus many of the ships were damaged;\r\ntwo indeed fell foul of each other and were destroyed, and many of\r\nthose sailing in them perished.[739] But when the river widened out,\r\nthere the current was no longer so rapid, and the eddies did not whirl\r\nround with so much violence. Alexander therefore moored his fleet on\r\nthe right bank, where there was a protection from the force of the\r\nstream and a roadstead for the ships. A certain promontory also in the\r\nriver jutted out conveniently for collecting the wrecks. He preserved\r\nthe lives of the men who were still being conveyed upon them; and when\r\nhe had repaired the damaged ships, he ordered Nearchus to sail down\r\nthe river until he reached the confines of the nation called Mallians.\r\nHe himself made an inroad into the territories of the barbarians who\r\nwould not yield to him, and after preventing them from succouring the\r\nMallians, he again formed a junction with the naval armament.[740]\r\nHephaestion, Craterus, and Philip had already united their forces here.\r\nAlexander then transported the elephants, the brigade of Polysperchon,\r\nthe horse-archers, and Philip with his army, across the river Hydaspes,\r\nand instructed Craterus to lead them. He sent Nearchus with the fleet\r\nwith orders to set sail three days before the army started. He divided\r\nthe rest of his army into three parts, and ordered Hephaestion to\r\ngo five days in advance, so that if any should flee before the men\r\nunder his own command and go rapidly forward they might fall in with\r\nHephaestion’s brigade and thus be captured. He also gave a part of the\r\narmy to Ptolemy, son of Lagus, with orders to follow him after the\r\nlapse of three days, so that all those who fled from him and turned\r\nback again might fall in with Ptolemy’s brigade. He ordered those in\r\nadvance to wait, when they arrived at the confluence of the rivers\r\nAcesines and Hydraotes, until he himself came up; and he instructed\r\nCraterus and Ptolemy also to form a junction with him at the same place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MALLIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then took the shield-bearing guards, the bowmen, the Agrianians,\r\nPeithon’s brigade of men, who were called foot Companions, all the\r\nhorse bowmen and half the cavalry Companions, and marched through a\r\ntract of country destitute of water against the Mallians, a tribe of\r\nthe independent Indians.[741] On the first day he encamped near a\r\nsmall piece of water which was about 100 stades distant from the river\r\nAcesines. Having dined there and caused his army to rest a short time,\r\nhe ordered every man to fill whatever vessel he had with water. After\r\ntravelling the remaining part of that day and all the ensuing night\r\na distance of about 400 stades, he at daybreak reached the city into\r\nwhich many of the Mallians had fled for refuge. Most of them were\r\noutside the city and unarmed, supposing that Alexander would never come\r\nagainst them through the waterless country. It was evident that he led\r\nhis army by this route for this very reason, because it was difficult\r\nto lead an army this way, and consequently it appeared incredible to\r\nthe enemy that he would lead his forces in this direction. He therefore\r\nfell upon them unexpectedly, and killed most of them without their\r\neven turning to defend themselves, since they were unarmed. He cooped\r\nthe rest up in the city, and posted his cavalry all round the wall,\r\nbecause the phalanx of infantry had not yet[742] come up with him.\r\nHe thus made use of his cavalry in place of a stockade. As soon as\r\nthe infantry arrived, he sent Perdiccas with his own cavalry regiment\r\nand that of Clitus, as well as the Agrianians, against another city\r\nof the Mallians, whither many of the Indians of that region had fled\r\nfor refuge. He ordered Perdiccas to blockade the men in the city, but\r\nnot to commence the action until he himself should arrive, so that\r\nnone might escape from this city and carry news to the rest of the\r\nbarbarians that Alexander was already approaching. He then began to\r\nassault the wall; but the barbarians abandoned it, finding that they\r\nwere no longer able to defend it, since many had been killed in the\r\ncapture, and others had been rendered unfit for fighting on account\r\nof their wounds. Fleeing for refuge into the citadel, they defended\r\nthemselves for some time from a position commanding from its height\r\nand difficult of access. But as the Macedonians pressed on vigorously\r\nfrom all sides, and Alexander himself appeared now in this part of the\r\naction and now in that, the citadel was taken by storm, and all the men\r\nwho had fled into it for refuge were killed, to the number of 2,000.\r\nPerdiccas also reached the city to which he had been despatched and\r\nfound it deserted; but learning that the inhabitants had fled from it\r\nnot long before, he made a forced march on the track of the fugitives.\r\nThe light-armed troops followed him as quickly as they could on foot,\r\nso that he took and massacred as many of the fugitives as could not\r\noutstrip him and flee for safety into the river-marshes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MALLIANS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dining and causing his men to rest until the first watch of the\r\nnight, Alexander marched forward; and travelling a great distance\r\nthrough the night, he arrived at the river Hydraotes[743] at daybreak.\r\nThere he ascertained that most of the Mallians had already crossed the\r\nriver; but coming upon those who were still in the act of crossing, he\r\nslew many of them in their passage. Having crossed with them in pursuit\r\nwithout any delay by the same ford, he kept close up with those who had\r\noutstripped him in their retreat. Many also of these he slew; some he\r\ntook prisoners; but the majority of them escaped into a place strong by\r\nnature and made more so by fortifications. When the infantry reached\r\nhim, Alexander despatched Peithon against the men in the fortress,\r\ngiving him the command of his own brigade of infantry and two regiments\r\nof cavalry. These, attacking the place, took it at the first assault,\r\nand made slaves of all those who had fled thither for safety, at least\r\nas many of them as had not perished in the attack. After accomplishing\r\nthis, Peithon returned again to the camp. Alexander in person led\r\nhis forces against a certain city of the Brachmans,[744] because he\r\nascertained that some of the Mallians had fled for refuge into it. When\r\nhe reached it, he led his phalanx in serried ranks close up to the wall\r\non all sides. The enemy seeing that their walls were being undermined,\r\nand being themselves repulsed by the missiles, abandoned the walls, and\r\nhaving fled for safety into the citadel, began to defend themselves\r\nfrom thence. A few Macedonians having rushed in with them, turning\r\nround and drawing together into a close body, drove some of them back\r\nand killed five-and-twenty of them in their retreat. Hereupon Alexander\r\nordered the scaling-ladders to be placed against the citadel on all\r\nsides, and the wall to be undermined; and when one of the towers, being\r\nundermined, fell down, and a part of the wall between two towers was\r\nbreached, and thus rendered the citadel more accessible to assault\r\nin this quarter, he was seen to be the first man to scale the wall\r\nand get hold of it. The other Macedonians seeing him were ashamed of\r\nthemselves and mounted the ladders in various places. The citadel was\r\nsoon in their possession. Some of the Indians began to set fire to the\r\nhouses, and being caught in them were killed; but most of them were\r\nslain fighting. About 5,000 in all were killed; and on account of their\r\nvalour, only a few were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF THE MALLIANS AT THE RIVER HYDRAOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving remained there one day to give his army rest, he advanced on the\r\nmorrow against the other Mallians. He found the cities abandoned, and\r\nascertained that the men had fled into the desert. There he again gave\r\nthe army one day’s rest, and on the next day sent Peithon and Demetrius\r\nthe cavalry general back to the river, in command of their own troops,\r\ngiving them in addition as many battalions of the light-armed infantry\r\nas were sufficient for the enterprise. Their instructions were to go\r\nalong the bank of the river, and if they met any of those who had fled\r\nfor safety into the woods, of which there were many near the river’s\r\nbank, to kill all who refused to surrender. Peithon and Demetrius\r\ncaptured many of these in the woods and killed them. He himself led\r\nhis forces against the largest city of the Mallians, whither he was\r\ninformed many from the other cities had taken refuge. But this also the\r\nIndians abandoned when they heard that Alexander was marching against\r\nit. Crossing the river Hydraotes, they remained with their forces drawn\r\nup upon its bank, because it was high, and they thought they could\r\nobstruct Alexander’s passage. When he heard this, he took all the\r\ncavalry which he had with him, and went to the part of the river where\r\nhe was informed that the Mallians had drawn themselves up for battle;\r\nand the infantry was ordered to follow. When he reached the river and\r\nbeheld the enemy drawn up on the opposite bank, he made no delay, but\r\ninstantly plunged into the ford with the cavalry alone. When they saw\r\nthat he was now in the middle of the river, though they were drawn\r\nup ready for battle, they withdrew from the bank with all speed; and\r\nAlexander followed them with his cavalry alone. But when the Indians\r\nperceived only cavalry, they wheeled round and fought with desperate\r\nvalour, being about 50,000 in number. When Alexander perceived that\r\ntheir phalanx was densely compact, and that his own infantry was\r\nabsent, he rode right round their army and made charges upon them, but\r\ndid not come to close fighting with them. Meanwhile the archers, the\r\nAgrianians and the other battalions of light-armed infantry, being\r\npicked men whom he was leading with him, arrived, and his phalanx of\r\ninfantry was seen not far off. As all kinds of danger were threatening\r\nthem at once, the Indians now wheeled round again and began to flee\r\nwith headlong speed into the strongest of their adjacent cities; but\r\nAlexander followed them and slew many, while those who escaped into the\r\ncity were cooped up within it. At first indeed he surrounded the city\r\nwith the horse-soldiers as they came up from the march; but when the\r\ninfantry arrived, he encamped all round the wall for this day, because\r\nnot much of it was left for making the assault, and his army had been\r\nexhausted, the infantry by the long march, and the cavalry by the\r\nuninterrupted pursuit, and especially by the passage of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSTORMING OF THE MALLIAN STRONGHOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, dividing the army into two parts, he himself\r\nassaulted the wall at the head of one, and Perdiccas led on the\r\nother. Upon this the Indians did not wait to receive the attack of\r\nthe Macedonians, but abandoned the walls of the city and fled for\r\nsafety into the citadel. Alexander and his troops therefore split\r\nopen a small gate, and got within the city long before the others;\r\nfor those who had been put under Perdiccas were behind time, having\r\nexperienced difficulty in scaling the walls, as most of them did not\r\nbring ladders, thinking that the city had been captured, when they\r\nobserved that the walls were deserted by the defenders. But when the\r\ncitadel was seen to be still in the possession of the enemy, and many\r\nof them were observed drawn up in front of it to repel attacks, some\r\nof the Macedonians tried to force an entry by undermining the wall,\r\nand others by placing scaling ladders against it, wherever it was\r\npracticable to do so. Alexander, thinking that the men who carried the\r\nladders were too slow, snatched one from a man who was carrying it,\r\nplaced it against the wall, and began to mount it, crouching under his\r\nshield. After him mounted Peucestas, the man who carried the sacred\r\nshield which Alexander took from the temple of the Trojan Athena and\r\nused to keep with him, and have it carried before him in all his\r\nbattles.[745] After Peucestas, by the same ladder ascended Leonnatus\r\nthe confidential body-guard; and up another ladder went Abreas, one of\r\nthe soldiers who received double pay for distinguished services.[746]\r\nThe king was now near the battlement of the wall, and leaning his\r\nshield against it was pushing some of the Indians within the fort,\r\nand had cleared that part of the wall, by killing others with his\r\nsword. The shield-bearing guards becoming very anxious for the king’s\r\nsafety, pushed each other with ardour up the same ladder and broke it;\r\nso that those who were already mounting fell down and made the ascent\r\nimpracticable for the rest. Alexander then, standing upon the wall,\r\nwas being assailed all round from the adjacent towers; for none of the\r\nIndians dared approach him. He was also being assailed by the men in\r\nthe city, who were throwing darts at him from no great distance; for\r\na mound of earth happened to have been heaped up there opposite the\r\nwall. Alexander was conspicuous both by the brightness of his weapons\r\nand by his extraordinary display of audacity. He therefore perceived\r\nthat if he remained where he was, he would be incurring danger without\r\nbeing able to perform anything at all worthy of consideration; but\r\nif he leaped down within the fort he might perhaps by this very act\r\nstrike the Indians with terror, and if he did not, but should only\r\nthereby be incurring danger, at any rate he would die not ignobly\r\nafter performing great deeds of valour worthy of recollection by men\r\nof after times.[747] Forming this resolution, he leaped down from the\r\nwall into the citadel; where, supporting himself against the wall, he\r\nstruck with his sword and killed some of the Indians who came to close\r\nquarters with him, including their leader, who rushed upon him too\r\nboldly. Another man who approached him he kept in check by hurling a\r\nstone at him, and a third in like manner. Those who advanced nearer to\r\nhim he again kept off with his sword; so that the barbarians were no\r\nlonger willing to approach him, but standing round him cast at him from\r\nall sides whatever any one happened to have or could get hold of at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime Peucestas and Abreas, the soldier entitled to double pay,\r\nand after them Leonnatus, being the only men who happened to have\r\nscaled the wall before the ladders were broken, had leaped down and\r\nwere fighting in front of the king. Abreas, the man entitled to double\r\npay, fell there, being shot with an arrow in the forehead. Alexander\r\nhimself also was wounded with an arrow under the breast through his\r\nbreastplate into the chest, so that Ptolemy says air was breathed out\r\nfrom the wound together with the blood. But although he was faint with\r\nexhaustion, he defended himself, as long as his blood was still warm.\r\nBut the blood streaming out copiously and without ceasing at every\r\nexpiration of breath, he was seized with a dizziness and swooning,\r\nand bending over fell upon his shield. After he had fallen Peucestas\r\ndefended him, holding over him in front the sacred shield brought\r\nfrom Troy; and on the other side he was defended by Leonnatus. But\r\nboth these men were themselves wounded, and Alexander was now nearly\r\nfainting away from loss of blood. For the Macedonians had experienced\r\ngreat difficulty in the assault also on this account, because those\r\nwho saw Alexander being shot at upon the wall and then leaping down\r\ninto the citadel within, in their ardour arising from fear lest their\r\nking should meet with any mishap by recklessly exposing himself to\r\ndanger, broke the ladders. Then some began to devise one plan and\r\nothers another to mount upon the wall, as well as they could in their\r\nstate of embarrassment, some fixing pegs into the wall, which was made\r\nof earth, and suspending themselves from these hoisted themselves up\r\nwith difficulty by their means; others got up by mounting one upon\r\nthe other. The first man who got up threw himself down from the wall\r\ninto the city, and so on in succession; and when they saw the king\r\nlying there on the ground they all raised a loud lamentation and howl\r\nof grief. Now ensued a desperate conflict around his fallen body, one\r\nMacedonian after another holding his shield in front of him. In the\r\nmeantime some of the soldiers having shivered in pieces the bar by\r\nwhich the gate in the space of wall between the towers was secured,\r\nentered the city a few at the time; while others, inasmuch as a gap\r\nhad been made in the gate, put their shoulders under it and forced it\r\ninto the space inside the wall, and thus laid the citadel open in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER WOUNDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nHereupon some of them began to kill the Indians, all of whom they slew,\r\nsparing not even a woman or child. Others carried off the king, who\r\nwas lying in a faint condition, upon his shield; and they could not\r\nyet tell whether he was likely to survive. Some authors have stated\r\nthat Critodemus, a physician of Cos, an Asclepiad by birth,[748]\r\nmade an incision into the injured part and drew the weapon out of\r\nthe wound. Other authors say that as there was no physician present\r\nat the critical moment, Perdiccas, the confidential body-guard, at\r\nAlexander’s bidding, made an incision with his sword into the wounded\r\npart and removed the weapon. On its removal there was such a copious\r\neffusion of blood that Alexander swooned again; and the effect of\r\nthe swoon was, that the effusion of blood was stanched.[749] Many\r\nother things concerning this catastrophe have been recorded by the\r\nhistorians; and Rumour having received the statements as they were\r\ngiven by the first falsifiers of the facts, still preserves them even\r\nto our times, nor will she desist from handing the falsehoods on to\r\nothers also in regular succession, unless a stop is put to it by this\r\nhistory.[750] For example, the common account is, that this calamity\r\nbefell Alexander among the Oxydracians; whereas, it really occurred\r\namong the Mallians, an independent tribe of Indians; the city belonged\r\nto the Mallians,[751] and the men who wounded him were Mallians. These\r\npeople, indeed, had resolved to join their forces with the Oxydracians\r\nand then to make a desperate struggle; but he forestalled them by\r\nmarching against them through the waterless country, before any aid\r\ncould reach them from the Oxydracians, or they could render any help\r\nto the latter. Moreover, the common account is, that the last battle\r\nfought with Darius was near Arbela, at which battle he fled and did not\r\ndesist from flight until he was arrested by Bessus and put to death\r\nat Alexander’s approach; just as the battle before this was at Issus,\r\nand the first cavalry battle near the Granicus. The cavalry battle did\r\nreally take place near the Granicus, and the next battle with Darius\r\nnear Issus; but those authors who make Arbela most distant say that it\r\nis 600[752] stades distant from the place where the last battle between\r\nAlexander and Darius was fought, while those who make it least distant,\r\nsay that it is 500 stades off. Moreover, Ptolemy and Aristobulus say\r\nthat the battle was fought at Gaugamela near the river Bumodus. But as\r\nGaugamela was not a city, but only a large village, the place is not\r\ncelebrated, nor is the name pleasing to the ear; hence, it seems to\r\nme, that Arbela, being a city, has carried off the glory of the great\r\nbattle. But if it is necessary to consider that this engagement took\r\nplace near Arbela, being in reality so far distant from it, then it is\r\nallowable to say that the sea-battle fought at Salamis occurred near\r\nthe isthmus[753] of the Corinthians, and that fought at Artemisium, in\r\nEuboea, occurred near Aegina or Sunium. Moreover, in regard to those\r\nwho covered Alexander with their shields in his peril, all agree that\r\nPeucestas did so; but they no longer agree in regard to Leonnatus or\r\nAbreas, the soldier in receipt of double pay for his distinguished\r\nservices. Some say that Alexander, having received a blow on the head\r\nwith a piece of wood, fell down in a fit of dizziness; and that having\r\nrisen again he was wounded with a dart through the corselet in the\r\nchest. But Ptolemy, son of Lagus, says that he received only this wound\r\nin the chest. However, in my opinion, the greatest error made by those\r\nwho have written the history of Alexander is the following. There are\r\nsome who have recorded[754] that Ptolemy, son of Lagus, in company with\r\nPeucestas, mounted the ladder with Alexander; that Ptolemy held his\r\nshield over him when he lay wounded, and that he was called Soter (the\r\npreserver) on that account.[755] And yet Ptolemy himself has recorded\r\nthat he was not even present at this engagement, but was fighting\r\nbattles against other barbarians at the head of another army. Let me\r\nmention these facts as a digression from the main narrative, so that\r\nthe correct account of such great deeds and calamities may not be a\r\nmatter of indifference to men of the future.[756]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nANXIETY OF THE SOLDIERS ABOUT ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Alexander was remaining in this place until his wound was cured,\r\nthe first news which reached the camp from which he had set out to\r\nattack the Mallians was that he had died of the wound; and at first\r\nthere arose a sound of lamentation from the entire army, as one man\r\nhanded the rumour on to another. When they ceased their lamentation,\r\nthey became spiritless, and felt perplexed as to the man who was to\r\nbecome the leader of the army; for many of the officers seemed to have\r\nstood in equal rank and merit, both in the opinion of Alexander and\r\nin that of the Macedonians. They were also in a state of perplexity\r\nhow to get back in safety to their own country, being quite enclosed\r\nby so many warlike nations, some of whom had not yet submitted, and\r\nwho they conjectured would fight stoutly for their freedom; while\r\nothers would no doubt revolt as soon as they were relieved of their\r\nfear of Alexander. Besides, they seemed at that time to be in the\r\nmidst of impassable rivers, and all things appeared to them uncertain\r\nand impracticable now that they were bereft of Alexander. But when at\r\nlength the news came that he was still alive, they with difficulty\r\nacquiesced in it; and did not yet believe that he was likely to\r\nsurvive. Even when a letter came from the king, saying that he was\r\ncoming down to the camp in a short time, this did not appear to most\r\nof them worthy of credit, on account of their excessive fear; for\r\nthey conjectured that the letter was concocted by his confidential\r\nbody-guards and generals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nJOY OF THE SOLDIERS AT ALEXANDER’S RECOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander became acquainted with this, for fear some attempt at a\r\nrevolution might be made in the army, he had himself conveyed, as soon\r\nas it could be done with safety, to the bank of the river Hydraotes,\r\nand placed in a boat to sail down the river. For the camp was at the\r\nconfluence of the Hydraotes and Acesines, where Hephaestion was at the\r\nhead of the army, and Nearchus of the fleet. When the ship bearing the\r\nking approached the camp, he ordered the tent covering to be removed\r\nfrom the stern, that he might be visible to all. But they were still\r\nincredulous, thinking, forsooth, that Alexander’s corpse was being\r\nconveyed on the vessel; until at length he stretched out his hand to\r\nthe multitude, when the ship was nearing the bank. Then the men raised\r\na cheer, lifting their hands, some towards the sky and others to the\r\nking himself. Many even shed involuntary tears at the unexpected sight.\r\nSome of the shield-bearing guards brought a litter for him when he\r\nwas conveyed out of the ship; but he ordered them to fetch his horse.\r\nWhen he was seen again mounting his horse, the whole army re-echoed\r\nwith loud clapping of hands, so that the banks of the river and the\r\ngroves near them reverberated with the sound. On approaching his tent\r\nhe dismounted from his horse, so that he might be seen walking. Then\r\nthe men came near, some on one side, others on the other, some touching\r\nhis hands, others his knees, others only his clothes. Some only came\r\nclose to get a sight of him, and went away having chanted his praise,\r\nwhile others threw garlands upon him, or the flowers which the country\r\nof India supplied at that season of the year. Nearchus says that some\r\nof his friends incurred his displeasure, reproaching him for exposing\r\nhimself to danger in the front of the army in battle; which they said\r\nwas the duty of a private soldier, and not that of the general.[757]\r\nIt seems to me that Alexander was offended at these remarks, because\r\nhe knew that they were correct, and that he deserved the censure.\r\nHowever, like those who are mastered by any other pleasure, he had\r\nnot sufficient self-control to keep aloof from danger, through his\r\nimpetuosity in battle and his passion for glory. Nearchus also says\r\nthat a certain old Boeotian, whose name he does not mention, perceiving\r\nthat Alexander was offended at the censures of his friends and was\r\nlooking sullenly at them, came near him, and speaking in the Boeotian\r\ndialect, said: “O Alexander, it is the part of heroes to perform great\r\ndeeds!” and repeated a certain Iambic verse, the purport of which\r\nis, that the man who performs anything great is destined also to\r\nsuffer.[758] This man was not only acceptable to Alexander at the time,\r\nbut was afterwards received into his more intimate acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE DOWN THE HYDRAOTES AND ACESINES INTO THE INDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time arrived envoys from the Mallians who still survived,\r\noffering the submission of the nation; also from the Oxydracians came\r\nboth the leaders of the cities and the governors of the provinces,\r\naccompanied by the other 150 most notable men, with full powers to make\r\na treaty, bringing the gifts which are considered most valuable among\r\nthe Indians, and also, like the Mallians, offering the submission of\r\ntheir nation. They said that their error in not having sent an embassy\r\nto him before was pardonable, because they excelled other races in the\r\ndesire to be free and independent, and their freedom had been secure\r\nfrom the time Dionysus came into India until Alexander came; but if\r\nit seemed good to him, inasmuch as there was a general report that\r\nhe also was sprung from gods, they were willing to receive whatever\r\nviceroy he might appoint, pay the tribute decreed by him, and give\r\nhim as many hostages as he might demand. He therefore demanded the\r\nthousand best men of the nation, whom he might hold as hostages, if he\r\npleased; and if not, that he might keep them as soldiers in his army,\r\nuntil he had finished the war which he was waging against the other\r\nIndians. They accordingly selected the thousand best and tallest men\r\nof their number, and sent them to him, together with 500 chariots and\r\ncharioteers, though these were not demanded. Alexander appointed Philip\r\nviceroy over these people and the Mallians who were still surviving.\r\nHe sent back the hostages to them, but retained the chariots. When\r\nhe had satisfactorily arranged these matters, since many vessels had\r\nbeen built during the delay arising from his being wounded,[759] he\r\nembarked 1,700 of the cavalry Companions, as many of the light-armed\r\ntroops as before, and 10,000 infantry, and sailed a short distance down\r\nthe river Hydraotes. But when that river mingled its waters with the\r\nAcesines, the latter giving its name to the united stream, he continued\r\nhis voyage down the Acesines, until he reached its junction with the\r\nIndus. For these four large rivers,[760] which are all navigable,\r\ndischarge their water into the river Indus, though each does not\r\nretain its distinct name. For the Hydaspes discharges itself into the\r\nAcesines, and after the junction the whole stream forms what is called\r\nthe Acesines. Again this same river unites with the Hydraotes, and\r\nafter absorbing this river, still retains its own name. After this\r\nthe Acesines takes in the Hyphasis, and finally flows into the Indus\r\nunder its own name; but after the junction it yields its name to the\r\nIndus. From this point I have no doubt that the Indus proceeds 100\r\nstades,[761] and perhaps more, before it is divided so as to form the\r\nDelta; and there it spreads out more like a lake than a river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE DOWN THE INDUS TO THE LAND OF MUSICANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere, at the confluence of the Acesines and Indus, he waited until\r\nPerdiccas with the army arrived, after having routed on his way the\r\nindependent tribe of the Abastanians.[762] Meantime, he was joined by\r\nother thirty-oared galleys and trading vessels which had been built\r\nfor him among the Xathrians, another independent tribe of Indians who\r\nhad yielded to him. From the Ossadians, who were also an independent\r\ntribe of Indians, came envoys to offer the submission of their nation.\r\nHaving fixed the confluence of the Acesines and Indus as the limit\r\nof Philip’s viceroyalty, he left with him all the Thracians and as\r\nmany men from the infantry regiments as appeared to him sufficient to\r\nprovide for the security of the country. He then ordered a city to be\r\nfounded there at the very junction of the two rivers, expecting that\r\nit would become large and famous among men.[763] He also ordered a\r\ndockyard to be made there. At this time the Bactrian Oxyartes, father\r\nof his wife Roxana, came to him, to whom he gave the viceroyalty over\r\nthe Parapamisadians, after dismissing the former viceroy, Tiryaspes,\r\nbecause he was reported to be exercising his authority improperly.[764]\r\nThen he transported Craterus with the main body of the army and the\r\nelephants to the left bank of the river Indus, both because it seemed\r\neasier for a heavy-armed force to march along that side of the river,\r\nand the tribes dwelling near were not quite friendly. He himself sailed\r\ndown to the capital of the Sogdians; where he fortified another city,\r\nmade another dockyard, and repaired his shattered vessels. He appointed\r\nOxyartes viceroy, and Peithon general of the land extending from the\r\nconfluence of the Indus and Acesines as far as the sea, together with\r\nall the coastland of India. He then again despatched Craterus with\r\nhis army through the country of the Arachotians and Drangians; and\r\nhimself sailed down the river into the dominions of Musicanus, which\r\nwas reported to be the most prosperous part of India. He advanced\r\nagainst this king because he had not yet come to meet him to offer the\r\nsubmission of himself and his land, nor had he sent envoys to seek\r\nhis alliance. He had not even sent him the gifts which were suitable\r\nfor a great king, or asked any favour from him. He accelerated his\r\nvoyage down the river to such a degree that he succeeded in reaching\r\nthe confines of the land of Musicanus before he had even heard that\r\nAlexander had started against him. Musicanus was so greatly alarmed\r\nthat he went as fast as he could to meet him, bringing with him\r\nthe gifts valued most highly among the Indians, and taking all his\r\nelephants. He offered to surrender both his nation and himself, at\r\nthe same time acknowledging his error, which was the most effectual\r\nway with Alexander for any one to get what he requested. Accordingly\r\nfor these considerations Alexander granted him an indemnity for his\r\noffences. He also granted him the privilege of ruling the city and\r\ncountry, both of which Alexander admired. Craterus was directed to\r\nfortify the citadel in the capital; which was done while Alexander was\r\nstill present. A garrison was also placed in it, because he thought the\r\nplace suitable for keeping the circumjacent tribes in subjection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN AGAINST OXYCANUS AND SAMBUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he took the archers, Agrianians, and cavalry sailing with him,\r\nand marched against the governor of that country, whose name was\r\nOxycanus,[765] because he neither came himself nor did envoys come\r\nfrom him, to offer the surrender of himself and his land. At the very\r\nfirst assault he took by storm the two largest cities under the rule\r\nof Oxycanus; in the second of which that prince himself was captured.\r\nThe booty he gave to his army, but the elephants he led with himself.\r\nThe other cities in the same land surrendered to him as he advanced,\r\nnor did any one turn to resist him; so cowed in spirit[766] had all\r\nthe Indians now become at the thought of Alexander and his fortune.\r\nHe then marched back against Sambus, whom he had appointed viceroy of\r\nthe mountaineer Indians and who was reported to have fled, because\r\nhe learned that Musicanus had been pardoned by Alexander and was\r\nruling over his own land. For he was at war with Musicanus. But when\r\nAlexander approached the city which the country of Sambus held as its\r\nmetropolis, the name of which was Sindimana, the gates were thrown\r\nopen to him at his approach, and the relations of Sambus reckoned up\r\nhis money and went out to meet him, taking with them the elephants\r\nalso. They assured him that Sambus had fled, not from any hostile\r\nfeeling towards Alexander, but fearing on account of the pardon of\r\nMusicanus.[767] He also captured another city which had revolted\r\nat this time, and slew as many of the Brachmans[768] as had been\r\ninstigators of this revolt. These men are the philosophers of the\r\nIndians, of whose philosophy, if such it may be called, I shall give an\r\naccount in my book descriptive of India.[769]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMUSICANUS EXECUTED.—CAPTURE OF PATALA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime he was informed that Musicanus had revolted. He despatched the\r\nviceroy, Peithon, son of Agenor, with a sufficient army against him,\r\nwhile he himself marched against the cities which had been put under\r\nthe rule of Musicanus. Some of these he razed to the ground, reducing\r\nthe inhabitants to slavery; and into others he introduced garrisons and\r\nfortified the citadels. After accomplishing this, he returned to the\r\ncamp and fleet. By this time Musicanus had been captured by Peithon,\r\nwho was bringing him to Alexander. The king ordered him to be hanged\r\nin his own country, and with him as many of the Brachmans as had\r\ninstigated him to the revolt. Then came to him the ruler of the land of\r\nthe Patalians,[770] who said that the Delta formed by the river Indus\r\nwas still larger than the Egyptian Delta.[771] This man surrendered\r\nto him the whole of his own land and entrusted both himself and his\r\nproperty to him. Alexander sent him away again in possession of his own\r\ndominions, with instructions to provide whatever was needful for the\r\nreception of the army. He then sent Craterus into Carmania with the\r\nbrigades of Attalus, Meleager, and Antigenes, some of the archers, and\r\nas many of the Companions and other Macedonians as, being now unfit\r\nfor military service, he was despatching to Macedonia by the route\r\nthrough the lands of the Arachotians and Zarangians. To Craterus he\r\nalso gave the duty of leading the elephants; but the rest of the army,\r\nexcept the part of it which was sailing with himself down to the sea,\r\nhe put under the command of Hephaestion. He transported Peithon with\r\nthe cavalry-lancers and Agrianians to the opposite bank of the Indus,\r\nnot the one along which Hephaestion was about to lead the army. Peithon\r\nwas ordered to collect men to colonize the cities which had just been\r\nfortified, and to form a junction with the king at Patala, after having\r\nsettled the affairs of the Indians of that region, if they attempted\r\nany revolutionary proceedings. On the third day of his voyage,\r\nAlexander was informed that the governor of the Patalians[772] had\r\ncollected most of his subjects and was going away by stealth, having\r\nleft his land deserted. For this reason Alexander sailed down the river\r\nwith greater speed than before[773]; and when he arrived at Patala, he\r\nfound both the country and the city deserted by the inhabitants and\r\ntillers of the soil. He however despatched the lightest troops in his\r\narmy in pursuit of the fugitives; and when some of them were captured,\r\nhe sent them away to the rest, bidding them be of good courage and\r\nreturn, for they might inhabit the city and till the country as before.\r\nMost of them accordingly returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE DOWN THE INDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter instructing Hephaestion to fortify the citadel in Patala, he sent\r\nmen into the adjacent country, which was waterless, to dig wells and to\r\nrender the land fit for habitation. Certain of the native barbarians\r\nattacked these men, and falling upon them unawares slew some of them;\r\nbut having lost many of their own men, they fled into the desert.\r\nThe work was therefore accomplished by those who had been sent out,\r\nanother army having joined them, which Alexander had despatched to take\r\npart in the work, when he heard of the attack of the barbarians. Near\r\nPatala the water of the Indus is divided into two large rivers, both\r\nof which retain the name of Indus as far as the sea. Here Alexander\r\nconstructed a harbour and dockyard; and when his works had advanced\r\ntowards completion he resolved to sail down as far as the mouth of the\r\nright branch of the river.[774] He gave Leonnatus the command of 1,000\r\ncavalry and 8,000 heavy and light-armed infantry, and sent him to march\r\nthrough the island of Patala opposite the naval expedition; while he\r\nhimself took the fastest sailing vessels, having one and a half bank of\r\noars, all the thirty-oared galleys, and some of the boats, and began\r\nto sail down the right branch of the river. The Indians of that region\r\nhad fled, and consequently he could get no pilot for the voyage, and\r\nthe navigation of the river was very difficult. On the day after the\r\nstart a storm arose, and the wind blowing right against the stream made\r\nthe river hollow[775] and shattered the hulls of the vessels violently,\r\nso that most of his ships were injured, and some of the thirty-oared\r\ngalleys were entirely broken up. But they succeeded in running them\r\naground before they quite fell to pieces in the water; and others were\r\ntherefore constructed. He then sent the quickest of the light-armed\r\ntroops into the land beyond the river’s bank and captured some Indians,\r\nwho from this time piloted him down the channel. But when they arrived\r\nat the place where the river expands, so that where it was widest it\r\nextended 200 stades, a strong wind blew from the outer sea, and the\r\noars could hardly be raised in the swell; they therefore took refuge\r\nagain in a canal into which his pilots conducted them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE DOWN THE INDUS INTO THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile their vessels were moored here, the phenomenon of the ebb and\r\nflow of the tide in the great sea occurred, so that their ships were\r\nleft upon dry ground. This caused Alexander and his companions no small\r\nalarm, inasmuch as they were previously quite unacquainted with it.\r\nBut they were much more alarmed when, the time coming round again, the\r\nwater approached and the hulls of the vessels were raised aloft.[776]\r\nThe ships which it caught settled in the mud were raised aloft without\r\nany damage, and floated again without receiving any injury; but those\r\nthat had been left on the drier land and had not a firm settlement,\r\nwhen an immense compact wave advanced, either fell foul of each other\r\nor were dashed against the land and thus shattered to pieces. When\r\nAlexander had repaired these vessels as well as his circumstances\r\npermitted, he sent some men on in advance down the river in two boats\r\nto explore the island at which the natives said he must moor his\r\nvessels in his voyage to the sea. They told him that the name of the\r\nisland was Cilluta.[777] As he was informed that there were harbours\r\nin this island, that it was a large one and had plenty of water in it,\r\nhe made the rest of his fleet put in there; but he himself with the\r\nbest sailing ships advanced beyond, to see if the mouth of the river\r\nafforded an easy voyage out into the open sea. After advancing about\r\n200 stades from the first island, they descried another which was quite\r\nout in the sea. Then indeed they returned to the island in the river;\r\nand having moored his vessels near the extremity of it, Alexander\r\noffered sacrifice to those gods to whom he said he had been directed by\r\nAmmon to sacrifice. On the following day he sailed down to the other\r\nisland which was in the deep sea; and having come to shore here also,\r\nhe offered other sacrifices to other gods and in another manner. These\r\nsacrifices he also offered according to the oracular instructions\r\nof Ammon. Then having gone beyond the mouths of the river Indus, he\r\nsailed out into the open sea, as he said, to discover if any land lay\r\nanywhere near in the sea; but in my opinion, chiefly that he might be\r\nable to say that he had navigated the great outer sea of India. There\r\nhe sacrificed some bulls to Poseidon and cast them into the sea; and\r\nhaving poured out a libation after the sacrifice, he threw the goblet\r\nand bowls, which were golden, into the deep as thank-offerings,\r\npraying the god to escort safely for him the fleet, which he intended\r\nto despatch to the Persian Gulf and the mouths of the Euphrates and\r\nTigres.[778]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION OF THE MOUTHS OF THE INDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to Patala, he found that the citadel had been fortified and\r\nthat Peithon had arrived with his army, having accomplished everything\r\nfor which he was despatched. He ordered Hephaestion to prepare what was\r\nneedful for the fortification of a naval station and the construction\r\nof dockyards; for he resolved to leave behind here a fleet of many\r\nships near the city of Patala, where the river Indus divides itself\r\ninto two streams. He himself sailed down again into the Great Sea by\r\nthe other mouth of the Indus, to ascertain which branch of the river is\r\neasier to navigate. The mouths of the river Indus are about 1800 stades\r\ndistant from each other.[779] In the voyage down he arrived at a large\r\nlake in the mouth of the river, which the river makes by spreading\r\nitself out; or perhaps the waters of the surrounding district draining\r\ninto it make it large, so that it very much resembles a gulf of the\r\nsea.[780] For in it were seen fish like those in the sea, larger indeed\r\nthan those in our sea. Having moored his ships then in this lake, where\r\nthe pilots directed, he left there most of the soldiers and all the\r\nboats with Leonnatus; but he himself with the thirty-oared galleys and\r\nthe vessels with one and a half row of oars passed beyond the mouth of\r\nthe Indus, and advancing into the sea also this way, ascertained that\r\nthe outlet of the river on this side (_i.e._ the west) was easier to\r\nnavigate than the other. He moored his ships near the shore, and taking\r\nwith him some of the cavalry went along the sea-coast three days’\r\njourney, exploring what kind of country it was for a coasting voyage,\r\nand ordering wells to be dug, so that the sailors might have water to\r\ndrink. He then returned to the ships and sailed back to Patala; but he\r\nsent a part of his army along the sea-coast to effect the same thing,\r\ninstructing them to return to Patala when they had dug the wells.\r\nSailing again down to the lake, he there constructed another harbour\r\nand dockyard; and leaving a garrison for the place, he collected\r\nsufficient food to supply the army for four months, as well as whatever\r\nelse he could procure for the coasting voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN AGAINST THE ORITIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe season of the year was then unfit for voyaging; for the periodical\r\nwinds prevailed, which at that season do not blow there from the\r\nnorth, as with us, but from the Great Sea, in the direction of the\r\nsouth wind.[781] Moreover it was reported that there the sea was fit\r\nfor navigation after the beginning of winter, from the setting of\r\nthe Pleiades[782] until the winter solstice; for at that season mild\r\nbreezes usually blow from the land, drenched as it has been with\r\ngreat rains; and these winds are convenient on a coasting voyage both\r\nfor oars and sails. Nearchus, who had been placed in command of the\r\nfleet, waited for the coasting season; but Alexander, starting from\r\nPatala, advanced with all his army as far as the river Arabius.[783]\r\nHe then took half of the shield-bearing guards and archers, the\r\ninfantry regiments called foot Companions, the guard of the Companion\r\ncavalry, a squadron of each of the other cavalry regiments, and all\r\nthe horse-bowmen, and turned away thence on the left towards the sea\r\nto dig wells, so that there might be abundance of them for the fleet\r\nsailing along on the coasting voyage; and at the same time to make an\r\nunexpected attack upon the Oritians,[784] a tribe of the Indians in\r\nthis region, which had long been independent. This he meditated doing\r\nbecause they had performed no friendly act either to himself or his\r\narmy. He placed Hephaestion in command of the forces left behind. The\r\nArabitians,[785] another independent tribe dwelling near the river\r\nArabius, thinking that they could not cope with Alexander in battle,\r\nand yet being unwilling to submit to him, fled into the desert when\r\nthey heard that he was approaching. But crossing the river Arabius,\r\nwhich was both narrow and shallow, and travelling by night through\r\nthe greater part of the desert, he came near the inhabited country at\r\ndaybreak. Then ordering the infantry to follow him in regular line, he\r\ntook the cavalry with him, dividing it into squadrons, that it might\r\noccupy a very large part of the plain, and thus marched into the land\r\nof the Oritians. All those who turned to defend themselves were cut to\r\npieces by the cavalry, and many of the others were taken prisoners. He\r\nthen encamped near a small piece of water; but when Hephaestion formed\r\na junction with him, he advanced farther. Arriving at the largest\r\nvillage of the tribe of the Oritians, which was called Rhambacia,[786]\r\nhe commended the place and thought that if he colonized a city there it\r\nwould become great and prosperous. He therefore left Hephaestion behind\r\nto carry out this project.[787]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nMARCH THROUGH THE DESERT OF GADROSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain he took half of the shield-bearing guards and Agrianians, the\r\nguard of cavalry and the horse-bowmen, and marched forward to the\r\nconfines of the Gadrosians and Oritians, where he was informed that\r\nthe passage was narrow, and the Oritians were drawn up with the\r\nGadrosians and were encamping in front of the pass, with the purpose\r\nof barring Alexander’s passage. They had indeed marshalled themselves\r\nthere; but when it was reported that he was already approaching, most\r\nof them fled from the pass, deserting their guard. The chiefs of the\r\nOritians, however, came to him, offering to surrender both themselves\r\nand their nation. He instructed these to collect the multitude of their\r\npeople together and send them to their own abodes, since they were not\r\nabout to suffer any harm. Over these people he placed Apollophanes as\r\nviceroy, and with him he left Leonnatus the confidential body-guard in\r\nOra,[788] at the head of all the Agrianians, some of the bowmen and\r\ncavalry, and the rest of the Grecian mercenary infantry and cavalry. He\r\ninstructed him to wait until the fleet had sailed round the land, to\r\ncolonize the city, and to regulate the affairs of the Oritians so that\r\nthey might pay the greater respect to the viceroy. He himself, with the\r\nmain body of the army (for Hephaestion had arrived at the head of the\r\nmen who had been left behind), advanced into the land of the Gadrosians\r\nby a route most of which was desert. Aristobulus says that in this\r\ndesert many myrrh-trees grew, larger than the ordinary kind; and that\r\nthe Phoenicians, who accompanied the army for trafficking, gathered the\r\ngum of myrrh, and loading the beasts of burden, carried it away.[789]\r\nFor there was a great quantity of it, inasmuch as it exuded from large\r\nstems and had never before been gathered. He also says that this desert\r\nproduces many odoriferous roots of nard,[790] which the Phoenicians\r\nlikewise gathered; but much of it was trampled down by the army, and a\r\nsweet perfume was diffused far and wide over the land by the trampling;\r\nso great was the abundance of it. In the desert there were also other\r\nkinds of trees, one of which had foliage like that of the bay-tree,\r\nand grew in places washed by the waves of the sea. These trees were on\r\nground which was left dry by the ebb-tide; but when the water advanced\r\nthey looked as if they had grown in the sea. Of others the roots were\r\nalways washed by the sea, because they grew in hollow places, from\r\nwhich the water could not retire; and yet the trees were not destroyed\r\nby the sea. Some of these trees in this region were even thirty cubits\r\nhigh. At that season they happened to be in bloom; and the flower was\r\nvery much like the white violet,[791] but the perfume was far superior\r\nto that of the latter. There was also another thorny stalk growing out\r\nof the earth, the thorn on which was so strong that, piercing the\r\nclothes of some men just riding past, it pulled the horseman down from\r\nhis horse rather than be itself torn off the stalk. It is also said\r\nthat when hares run past these bushes, the thorns cling to their fur;\r\nand thus these animals are caught, as birds are with bird-lime, or\r\nfish with hooks. However they were easily cut through with steel; and\r\nwhen the thorns are cut the stalk gives forth much juice, still more\r\nabundantly than fig-trees do in the springtime, and more pungent.[792]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMARCH THROUGH THE DESERT OF GADROSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThence Alexander marched through the land of the Gadrosians, by a\r\ndifficult route, which was also destitute of all the necessaries of\r\nlife; and in many places there was no water for the army. Moreover they\r\nwere compelled to march most of the way by night, and a great distance\r\nfrom the sea. However he was very desirous of coming to the part of the\r\ncountry along the sea, both to see what harbours were there, and to\r\nmake what preparations he could on his march for the fleet, either by\r\nemploying his men in digging wells, or by making arrangements somewhere\r\nfor a market and anchorage. But the part of the country of the\r\nGadrosians near the sea was entirely desert. He therefore sent Thoas,\r\nson of Mandrodorus, with a few horsemen down to the sea, to reconnoitre\r\nand see if there happened to be any haven anywhere near, or whether\r\nthere was water or any other of the necessaries of life not far from\r\nthe sea. This man returned and reported that he found some fishermen\r\nupon the shore living in stifling huts, which were made by putting\r\ntogether mussel-shells, and the back-bones of fishes were used to form\r\nthe roofs.[793] He also said that these fishermen used little water,\r\nobtaining it with difficulty by scraping away the gravel, and that what\r\nthey got was not at all fresh. When Alexander reached a certain place\r\nin Gadrosia, where corn was more abundant, he seized it and placed\r\nit upon the beasts of burden; and marking it with his own seal, he\r\nordered it to be conveyed down to the sea. But while he was marching\r\nto the halting stage nearest to the sea, the soldiers paying little\r\nregard to the seal, the guards made use of the corn themselves, and\r\ngave a share of it to those who were especially pinched with hunger.\r\nTo such a degree were they overcome by their misery that after mature\r\ndeliberation they resolved to take account of the visible and already\r\nimpending destruction rather than the danger of incurring the king’s\r\nwrath, which was not before their eyes and still remote. When Alexander\r\nascertained the necessity which constrained them so to act, he pardoned\r\nthose who had done the deed. He himself hastened forward to collect\r\nfrom the land all he could for victualling the army which was sailing\r\nround with the fleet; and sent Cretheus the Callatian[794] to convey\r\nthe supplies to the coast. He also ordered the natives to grind as much\r\ncorn as they could and convey it down from the interior of the country,\r\ntogether with dates[795] and sheep for sale to the soldiers. Moreover\r\nhe sent Telephus, one of the confidential Companions, down to another\r\nplace on the coast with a small quantity of ground corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMARCH THROUGH GADROSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then advanced towards the capital of the Gadrosians, which was\r\nnamed Pura[796]; and he arrived there in sixty days after starting\r\nfrom Ora. Most of the historians of Alexander’s reign assert that\r\nall the hardships which his army suffered in Asia were not worthy of\r\ncomparison with the labours undergone here. Nearchus alone asserts that\r\nAlexander pursued this route, not from ignorance of the difficulty\r\nof the journey, but because he heard that no one had ever hitherto\r\npassed that way with an army and emerged in safety from the desert,\r\nexcept Semiramis, when she fled from India. The natives said that even\r\nshe emerged with only twenty men of her army; and that Cyrus, son of\r\nCambyses, escaped with only seven of his men.[797] For they say that\r\nCyrus also marched into this region for the purpose of invading India;\r\nbut that he did not effect his retreat before losing the greater part\r\nof his army, from the desert and the other difficulties of this route.\r\nWhen Alexander received this information he was seized with a desire of\r\nexcelling Cyrus and Semiramis. Nearchus says that he turned his march\r\nthis way, both for this reason and at the same time for the purpose of\r\nconveying provisions near the fleet. The scorching heat and lack of\r\nwater destroyed a great part of the army, and especially the beasts of\r\nburden; most of which perished from thirst and some of them even from\r\nthe depth and heat of the sand, because it had been thoroughly scorched\r\nby the sun. For they met with lofty ridges of deep sand, not closely\r\npressed and hardened, but such as received those who stepped upon it\r\njust as if they were stepping into mud, or rather into untrodden snow.\r\nAt the same time too the horses and mules suffered still more, both in\r\ngoing up and coming down the hills, from the unevenness of the road as\r\nwell as from its instability. The length of the marches between the\r\nstages also exceedingly distressed the army; for the lack of water\r\noften compelled them to make the marches of unusual length.[798]\r\nWhen they travelled by night on a journey which it was necessary to\r\ncomplete, and at daybreak came to water, they suffered no hardship at\r\nall; but if, while still on the march, on account of the length of\r\nthe way, they were caught by the heat, then they did indeed suffer\r\nhardships from the blazing sun, being at the same time oppressed by\r\nunassuageable thirst.[799]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nSUFFERINGS OF THE ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soldiers killed many of the beasts of burden of their own accord;\r\nfor when provisions were lacking, they came together, and slaughtered\r\nmost of the horses and mules. They ate the flesh of these, and said\r\nthat they had died of thirst or had perished from the heat. There was\r\nno one who divulged the real truth of their conduct, both on account of\r\nthe men’s distress and because all alike were implicated in the same\r\noffence. What was being done had not escaped Alexander’s notice; but\r\nhe saw that the best cure for the present state of affairs would be\r\nto pretend to be ignorant of it, rather than to permit it as a thing\r\nknown to himself. The consequence was, that it was no longer easy to\r\nconvey the soldiers who were suffering from disease, or those who were\r\nleft behind on the roads on account of the heat, partly from the want\r\nof beasts of burden and partly because the men themselves were knocking\r\nthe waggons to pieces, not being able to draw them on account of the\r\ndepth of the sand. They did this also because in the first stages they\r\nwere compelled on this account to go, not by the shortest routes, but\r\nby those which were easiest for the carriages. Thus some were left\r\nbehind along the roads on account of sickness, others from fatigue or\r\nthe effects of the heat, or from not being able to bear up against the\r\ndrought; and there was no one either to show them the way or to remain\r\nand tend them in their sickness. For the expedition was being made\r\nwith great urgency; and the care of individual persons was necessarily\r\nneglected in the zeal displayed for the safety of the army as a whole.\r\nAs they generally made the marches by night, some of the men were\r\novercome by sleep on the road; afterwards rousing up again, those who\r\nstill had strength followed upon the tracks of the army; but only a few\r\nout of many overtook the main body in safety. Most of them perished in\r\nthe sand, like men shipwrecked on the sea.[800] Another calamity also\r\nbefell the army, which greatly distressed men, horses, and beasts of\r\nburden; for the country of the Gadrosians is supplied with rain by the\r\nperiodical winds, just as that of the Indians is; not the plains of\r\nGadrosia, but only the mountains where the clouds are carried by the\r\nwind and are dissolved into rain without passing beyond the summits of\r\nthe mountains. On one occasion, when the army bivouacked, for the sake\r\nof its water, near a small brook which was a winter torrent, about the\r\nsecond watch of the night the brook which flowed there was suddenly\r\nswelled by the rains in the mountains which had fallen unperceived by\r\nthe soldiers. The torrent advanced with so great a flood as to destroy\r\nmost of the wives and children of the men who followed the army, and to\r\nsweep away all the royal baggage as well as all the beasts of burden\r\nstill remaining. The soldiers, after great exertions, were hardly able\r\nto save themselves together with their weapons, many of which they lost\r\nbeyond recovery. When, after enduring the burning heat and thirst, they\r\nlighted upon abundance of water, many of them perished from drinking to\r\nexcess, not being able to check their appetite for it. For this reason\r\nAlexander generally pitched his camp, not near the water itself, but\r\nat a distance of about twenty stades from it, to prevent the men and\r\nbeasts from pressing in crowds into the river and thus perishing, and\r\nat the same time to prevent those who had no control over themselves\r\nfrom fouling the water for the rest of the army by stepping into the\r\nsprings or streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S MAGNANIMOUS CONDUCT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I have resolved not to pass over in silence the most noble deed\r\nperhaps ever performed by Alexander, which occurred either in this land\r\nor, according to the assertion of some other authors, still earlier,\r\namong the Parapamisadians.[801] The army was continuing its march\r\nthrough the sand, though the heat of the sun was already scorching,\r\nbecause it was necessary to reach water before halting. They were far\r\non the journey, and Alexander himself, though oppressed with thirst,\r\nwas nevertheless with great pain and difficulty leading the army on\r\nfoot, so that his soldiers, as is usual in such a case, might more\r\npatiently bear their hardships by the equalization of the distress. At\r\nthis time some of the light-armed soldiers, starting away from the army\r\nin quest of water, found some collected in a shallow cleft, a small and\r\nmean spring. Collecting this water with difficulty, they came with all\r\nspeed to Alexander, as if they were bringing him some great boon. As\r\nsoon as they approached the king, they poured the water into a helmet\r\nand carried it to him. He took it, and commending the men who brought\r\nit, immediately poured it upon the ground in the sight of all. As a\r\nresult of this action, the entire army was re-invigorated to so great\r\na degree that any one would have imagined that the water poured away\r\nby Alexander had furnished a draught to every man. This deed beyond\r\nall others I commend as evidence of Alexander’s power of endurance\r\nand self-control, as well as of his skill in managing an army. The\r\nfollowing adventure also occurred to the army in that country. At last\r\nthe guides declared that they no longer remembered the way, because\r\nthe tracks of it had been rendered invisible by the wind blowing the\r\nsand over them. Moreover, in the deep sand which had been everywhere\r\nreduced to one level, there was nothing by which they could conjecture\r\nthe right way, not even the usual trees growing along it, nor any solid\r\nhillock rising up; and they had not practised themselves in making\r\njourneys by the stars at night or by the sun in the daytime, as sailors\r\ndo by the constellations of the Bears—the Phoenicians by the Little\r\nBear, and other men by the Greater Bear.[802] Then at length Alexander\r\nperceived that it was necessary for him to lead the way by declining to\r\nthe left; and taking a few horsemen with him he advanced in front of\r\nthe army. But when the horses even of these were exhausted by the heat,\r\nhe left most of these men behind, and rode away with only five men and\r\nfound the sea. Having scraped away the shingle on the sea-beach, he\r\nfound water fresh and pure, and then went and fetched the whole army.\r\nFor seven days they marched along the sea-coast, supplying themselves\r\nwith water from the shore. Thence he led his expedition into the\r\ninterior, for now the guides knew the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nMARCH THROUGH CARMANIA.—PUNISHMENT OF VICEROYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the capital of Gadrosia, he there gave his army\r\na rest. He deposed Apollophanes from the viceroyalty,[803] because\r\nhe discovered that he had paid no heed to his instructions. Thoas\r\nwas appointed viceroy over the people of this district; but as he\r\nfell ill and died, Sibyrtius succeeded to the office. The same man\r\nhad also lately been appointed by Alexander viceroy of Carmania; but\r\nnow the rule over the Arachotians and Gadrosians was given to him,\r\nand Tlepolemus, son of Pythophanes, received Carmania. The king was\r\nalready advancing into Carmania, when news was brought to him that\r\nPhilip, the viceroy of the country of the Indians, had been plotted\r\nagainst by the mercenaries and treacherously killed; but that Philip’s\r\nMacedonian body-guards had caught some of the murderers in the very\r\nact and others afterwards, and had put them to death. When he had\r\nascertained this, he sent a letter into India to Eudemus and Taxiles,\r\nordering them to administer the affairs of the land which had\r\npreviously been subordinated to Philip until he could send a viceroy\r\nfor it. When he arrived in Carmania, Craterus effected a junction with\r\nhim, bringing with him the rest of the army and the elephants. He\r\nalso brought Ordanes, whom he had arrested for revolting and trying\r\nto effect a revolution.[804] Thither also came Stasanor, the viceroy\r\nof the Areians[805] and Zarangians, accompanied by Pharismanes, son\r\nof Phrataphernes, the viceroy of the Parthians and Hyrcanians. There\r\ncame also the generals who had been left with Parmenio over the army in\r\nMedia, Cleander, Sitalces, and Heracon, bringing with them the greater\r\npart of their army. Both the natives and the soldiers themselves\r\nbrought many accusations against Cleander and Sitalces, as for example,\r\nthat the temples had been pillaged by them, old tombs rifled, and other\r\nacts of injustice, recklessness, and tyranny perpetrated against their\r\nsubjects. As these charges were proved,[806] he put them to death,\r\nin order to inspire others who might be left as viceroys, governors,\r\nor prefects of provinces with the fear of suffering equal penalties\r\nwith them if they swerved from the path of duty.[807] This was one of\r\nthe chief means by which Alexander kept in subordination the nations\r\nwhich he had conquered in war or which had voluntarily submitted to\r\nhim, though they were so many in number and so far distant from each\r\nother; because under his regal sway it was not allowed that those who\r\nwere ruled should be unjustly treated by those who ruled. At that time\r\nHeracon was acquitted of the charge, but soon after, being convicted\r\nby the men of Susa of having pillaged the temple in that city, he also\r\nsuffered punishment. Stasanor and Phrataphernes came to Alexander\r\nbringing a multitude of beasts of burden and many camels, when they\r\nlearnt that he was marching by the route to Gadrosia, conjecturing that\r\nhis army would suffer the very hardships which it did suffer. Therefore\r\nthese men arrived just at the very time they were required, as also did\r\ntheir camels and beasts of burden. For Alexander distributed all these\r\nanimals to the officers man by man, to all the various squadrons and\r\ncenturies of the cavalry, and to the various companies of the infantry,\r\nas their number allowed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER IN CARMANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain authors have said (though to me the statement seems incredible)\r\nthat Alexander led his forces through Carmania lying extended with\r\nhis Companions upon two covered waggons joined together, the flute\r\nbeing played to him; and that the soldiers followed him wearing\r\ngarlands and sporting. Food was provided for them, as well as all\r\nkinds of dainties which had been brought together along the roads by\r\nthe Carmanians. They say that he did this in imitation of the Bacchic\r\nrevelry of Dionysus, because a story was told about that deity, that\r\nafter subduing the Indians he traversed the greater part of Asia in\r\nthis manner and received the appellation of Thriambus.[808] For the\r\nsame reason the processions in honour of victories after war were\r\ncalled _thriambi_. This has been recorded neither by Ptolemy, son of\r\nLagus, nor by Aristobulus, son of Aristobulus, nor by any other writer\r\nwhose testimony on such points any one would feel to be worthy of\r\ncredit. It is sufficient therefore for me to record it as unworthy of\r\nbelief.[809] But as to what I am now going to describe I follow the\r\naccount of Aristobulus. In Carmania Alexander offered sacrifices to the\r\ngods as thank-offerings for his victory over the Indians, and because\r\nhis army had been brought in safety out of Gadrosia. He also celebrated\r\na musical and gymnastic contest. He then appointed Peucestas one of his\r\nconfidential body-guards, having already resolved to make him viceroy\r\nof Persis. He wished him, before being appointed to the viceroyalty,\r\nto experience this honour and evidence of confidence, as a reward for\r\nhis exploit among the Mallians. Up to this time the number of his\r\nconfidential body-guards had been seven:—Leonnatus, son of Anteas,\r\nHephaestion, son of Amyntor, Lysimachus, son of Agathocles, Aristonoüs,\r\nson of Pisaeus, these four being Pellaeans; Perdiccas, son of Orontes,\r\nfrom Orestis, Ptolemy, son of Lagus, and Peithon, son of Crateas, the\r\nHeordaeans. Peucestas, who had held the shield over Alexander, was now\r\nadded to them as an eighth. At this time Nearchus, having sailed round\r\nthe coast of Ora and Gadrosia and that of the Ichthyophagi, put into\r\nport in the inhabited part of the coastland of Carmania,[810] and going\r\nup thence into the interior with a few men he reported to Alexander\r\nthe particulars of the voyage which he had made along the coasts of\r\nthe external sea. Nearchus was then sent down to the sea again to\r\nsail round as far as the country of Susiana, and the outlets of the\r\nriver Tigres.[811] How he sailed from the river Indus to the Persian\r\nSea and the mouth of the Tigres, I shall describe in a separate book,\r\nfollowing the account of Nearchus himself.[812] For he also wrote a\r\nhistory of Alexander in Greek. Perhaps I shall be able to compose this\r\nnarrative in the future, if inclination and the divine influence urge\r\nme to it. Alexander now ordered Hephaestion to march into Persis[813]\r\nfrom Carmania along the seashore with the larger division of the army\r\nand the beasts of burden, taking with him also the elephants; because,\r\nas he was making the expedition in the season of winter,[814] the part\r\nof Persis near the sea was warm and possessed abundant supplies of\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER IN PERSIS.—TOMB OF CYRUS REPAIRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe himself then marched to Pasargadae in Persis, with the lightest of\r\nhis infantry, the Companion cavalry and a part of the archers; but\r\nhe sent Stasanor down to his own land.[815] When he arrived at the\r\nconfines of Persis, he found that Phrasaortes was no longer viceroy,\r\nfor he happened to have died of disease while Alexander was still in\r\nIndia. Orxines was managing the affairs of the country, not because he\r\nhad been appointed ruler by Alexander, but because he thought it his\r\nduty to keep Persia in order for him, as there was no other ruler.[816]\r\nAtropates, the viceroy of Media, also came to Pasargadae, bringing\r\nBaryaxes, a Mede, under arrest, because he had assumed the upright\r\nhead-dress and called himself king of the Persians and Medes.[817]\r\nWith Baryaxes he also brought those who had taken part with him in the\r\nattempted revolution and revolt. Alexander put these men to death.\r\n\r\nHe was grieved by the outrage committed upon the tomb of Cyrus, son\r\nof Cambyses; for according to Aristobulus, he found it dug through\r\nand pillaged. The tomb of the famous Cyrus was in the royal park at\r\nPasargadae, and around it a grove of all kinds of trees had been\r\nplanted. It was also watered by a stream, and high grass grew in the\r\nmeadow. The base of the tomb itself had been made of squared stone in\r\nthe form of a rectangle. Above there was a stone building surmounted\r\nby a roof, with a door leading within, so narrow that even a small man\r\ncould with difficulty enter, after suffering much discomfort.[818] In\r\nthe building lay a golden coffin, in which the body of Cyrus had been\r\nburied, and by the side of the coffin was a couch, the feet of which\r\nwere of gold wrought with the hammer. A carpet of Babylonian tapestry\r\nwith purple rugs formed the bedding; upon it were also a Median coat\r\nwith sleeves and other tunics of Babylonian manufacture. Aristobulus\r\nadds that Median trousers and robes dyed the colour of hyacinth were\r\nalso lying upon it, as well as others of purple and various other\r\ncolours; moreover there were collars, sabres, and earrings of gold and\r\nprecious stones soldered together, and near them stood a table. On\r\nthe middle of the couch lay the coffin[819] which contained the body\r\nof Cyrus. Within the enclosure, near the ascent leading to the tomb,\r\nthere was a small house built for the Magians who guarded the tomb; a\r\nduty which they had discharged ever since the time of Cambyses, son\r\nof Cyrus, son succeeding father as guard. To these men a sheep and\r\nspecified quantities of wheaten flour and wine were given daily by\r\nthe king; and a horse once a month as a sacrifice to Cyrus. Upon the\r\ntomb an inscription in Persian letters had been placed, which bore the\r\nfollowing meaning in the Persian language: “O man, I am Cyrus, son of\r\nCambyses, who founded the empire of the Persians, and was king of Asia.\r\nDo not therefore grudge me this monument.” As soon as Alexander had\r\nconquered Persia, he was very desirous of entering the tomb of Cyrus;\r\nbut he found that everything else had been carried off except the\r\ncoffin and couch. They had even maltreated the king’s body; for they\r\nhad torn off the lid of the coffin and cast out the corpse. They had\r\ntried to make the coffin itself of smaller bulk and thus more portable,\r\nby cutting part of it off and crushing part of it up; but as their\r\nefforts did not succeed, they departed, leaving the coffin in that\r\nstate. Aristobulus says that he was himself commissioned by Alexander\r\nto restore the tomb for Cyrus, to put in the coffin the parts of the\r\nbody still preserved, to put the lid on, and to restore the parts\r\nof the coffin which had been defaced. Moreover he was instructed to\r\nstretch the couch tight with bands, and to deposit all the other things\r\nwhich used to lie there for ornament, both resembling the former ones\r\nand of the same number. He was ordered also to do away with the door,\r\nbuilding part of it up with stone and plastering part of it over with\r\ncement; and finally to put the royal seal upon the cement. Alexander\r\narrested the Magians who were the guards of the tomb, and put them to\r\nthe torture to make them confess who had done the deed; but in spite of\r\nthe torture they confessed nothing either about themselves or any other\r\nperson. In no other way were they proved to have been privy to the\r\ndeed; they were therefore released by Alexander.[820]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nPEUCESTAS APPOINTED VICEROY OF PERSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThence he proceeded to the royal palace of the Persians, which he\r\nhad on a former occasion himself burnt down, as I have previously\r\nrelated, expressing my disapprobation of the act[821]; and on his\r\nreturn Alexander himself did not commend it. Many charges were brought\r\nby the Persians against Orxines, who ruled them after the death of\r\nPhrasaortes. He was convicted of having pillaged temples and royal\r\ntombs, and of having unjustly put many of the Persians to death. He\r\nwas therefore hanged by men acting under Alexander’s orders[822]; and\r\nPeucestas the confidential body-guard was appointed viceroy of Persis.\r\nThe king placed special confidence in him both for other reasons,\r\nand especially on account of his exploit among the Mallians, where\r\nhe braved the greatest dangers and helped to save Alexander’s life.\r\nBesides this, he did not refuse to accommodate himself to the Asiatic\r\nmode of living; and as soon as he was appointed to the position of\r\nviceroy of Persis, he openly assumed the native garb, being the only\r\nman among the Macedonians who adopted the Median dress in preference\r\nto the Grecian.[823] He also learnt to speak the Persian language\r\ncorrectly, and comported himself in all other respects like a Persian.\r\nFor this conduct he was not only commended by Alexander, but the\r\nPersians also were highly delighted with him, for preferring their\r\nnational customs to those of his own forefathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S PLANS.—THE INDIAN PHILOSOPHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander arrived at Pasargadae and Persepolis,[824] he was seized\r\nwith an ardent desire to sail down the Euphrates and Tigres[825] to the\r\nPersian Sea, and to see the mouths of those rivers as he had already\r\nseen those of the Indus as well as the sea into which it flows. Some\r\nauthors[826] also have stated that he was meditating a voyage round the\r\nlarger portion of Arabia, the country of the Ethiopians, Libya (_i.e._\r\nAfrica), and Numidia beyond Mount Atlas to Gadeira (_i.e._ Cadiz),[827]\r\ninward into our sea (_i.e._ the Mediterranean); thinking that after he\r\nhad subdued both Libya and Carchedon (_i.e._ Carthage), he might with\r\njustice be called king of all Asia.[828] For he said that the kings\r\nof the Persians and Medes called themselves Great Kings without any\r\nright, since they did not rule the larger part of Asia. Some say that\r\nhe was meditating a voyage thence into the Euxine Sea, to Scythia and\r\nthe Lake Maeotis (_i.e._ the Sea of Azov); while others assert that\r\nhe intended to go to Sicily and the Iapygian Cape,[829] for the fame\r\nof the Romans spreading far and wide was now exciting his jealousy.\r\nFor my own part I cannot conjecture with any certainty what were his\r\nplans; and I do not care to guess. But this I think I can confidently\r\naffirm, that he meditated nothing small or mean; and that he would\r\nnever have remained satisfied with any of the acquisitions he had made,\r\neven if he had added Europe to Asia, or the islands of the Britons to\r\nEurope; but would still have gone on seeking for unknown lands beyond\r\nthose mentioned. I verily believe that if he had found no one else to\r\nstrive with, he would have striven with himself. And on this account\r\nI commend some of the Indian philosophers, who are said to have been\r\ncaught by Alexander as they were walking in the open meadow where they\r\nwere accustomed to spend their time.[830] At the sight of him and his\r\narmy they did nothing else but stamp with their feet on the earth, upon\r\nwhich they were stepping. When he asked them by means of interpreters\r\nwhat was the meaning of their action, they replied as follows: “O\r\nking Alexander, every man possesses as much of the earth as this upon\r\nwhich we have stepped; but thou being only a man like the rest of us,\r\nexcept in being meddlesome and arrogant, art come over so great a part\r\nof the earth from thy own land, giving trouble both to thyself and\r\nothers.[831] And yet thou also wilt soon die, and possess only as much\r\nof the earth as is sufficient for thy body to be buried in.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S DEALINGS WITH THE INDIAN SAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Alexander commended both the words and the men who\r\nspoke them; but nevertheless he did just the opposite to that which he\r\ncommended. When also in the Isthmus he met Diogenes of Sinope, lying\r\nin the sun, standing near him with his shield-bearing guards and foot\r\nCompanions, he asked if he wanted anything. But Diogenes said that he\r\nwanted nothing else, except that he and his attendants would stand out\r\nof the sunlight. Alexander is said to have expressed his admiration\r\nof Diogenes’s conduct.[832] Thus it is evident that Alexander was\r\nnot entirely destitute of better feelings; but he was the slave of\r\nhis insatiable ambition. Again, when he arrived at Taxila and saw\r\nthe naked sect of Indian philosophers, he was exceedingly desirous\r\nthat one of these men should live with him; because he admired their\r\npower of endurance.[833] But the oldest of the philosophers, Dandamis\r\nby name, of whom the others were disciples, refused to come himself\r\nto Alexander, and would not allow the others to do so.[834] He is\r\nsaid to have replied that he was himself a son of Zeus, if Alexander\r\nwas[835]; and that he wanted nothing from him, because he was quite\r\ncontented with what he had. And besides he said that he saw his\r\nattendants wandering over so much of the land and sea to no advantage,\r\nand that there was no end to their many wanderings. Therefore he had\r\nno desire that Alexander should give him anything which was in his\r\nown possession, nor on the other hand was he afraid that he should\r\nbe excluded from anything which Alexander ruled over. For while he\r\nlived the country of India, which produces the fruits in their season,\r\nwas sufficient for him; and when he died he should be released from\r\nthe body, an unsuitable associate. Alexander then did not attempt\r\nto force him to come with him, considering that the man was free to\r\ndo as he pleased. But Megasthenes has recorded that Calanus, one of\r\nthe philosophers of this region, who had very little power over his\r\ndesires, was induced to do so; and that the philosophers themselves\r\nreproached him, for having deserted the happiness existing among them,\r\nand serving another lord instead of the God.[836]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSELF-SACRIFICE OF THE INDIAN CALANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis I have recorded, because in a history of Alexander it is necessary\r\nalso to speak of Calanus; for when he was in the country of Persis\r\nhis health became delicate, though he had never before been subject\r\nto illness.[837] Accordingly, not being willing to lead the life of a\r\nman in infirm health, he told Alexander that in such circumstances\r\nhe thought it best for him to put an end to his existence, before he\r\ncame into experience of any disease which might compel him to change\r\nhis former mode of living. For a long time the king tried to dissuade\r\nhim; however, when he saw that he was not to be overcome, but would\r\nfind some other way of release, if this were not yielded to him, he\r\nordered a funeral pyre to be heaped up for him, in the place where the\r\nman himself directed, and gave instructions that Ptolemy, son of Lagus,\r\nthe confidential body-guard, should have the charge of it. They say\r\nthat a solemn procession, consisting both of horses and men, advanced\r\nbefore him, some of the latter being armed and others carrying all\r\nkinds of incense for the pyre. They also say that they were carrying\r\ngold and silver goblets and royal apparel; and because he was unable to\r\nwalk through illness, a horse was prepared for him. However, not being\r\nable to mount the horse, he was conveyed stretched out upon a litter,\r\ncrowned with a garland after the custom of the Indians, and singing in\r\nthe Indian language. The Indians say that he sang hymns to the gods and\r\neulogiums on his countrymen.[838] Before he ascended the funeral-pyre\r\nhe presented the horse which he should himself have mounted, being a\r\nroyal steed of the Nisaean breed,[839] to Lysimachus, one of those who\r\nattended him to learn his philosophy. He distributed among his other\r\ndisciples the goblets and rugs which Alexander had ordered to be cast\r\ninto the pyre as an honour to him. Then mounting the pyre he lay down\r\nupon it in a becoming manner, and was visible to the whole army. To\r\nAlexander the spectacle appeared unseemly, as it was being exhibited at\r\nthe cost of a friend; but to the rest it was a cause of wonder that he\r\ndid not move any part of his body in the fire.[840] As soon as the men\r\nto whom the duty had been assigned set fire to the pyre, Nearchus says\r\nthe trumpets sounded, in accordance with Alexander’s order, and the\r\nwhole army raised the war-cry as it was in the habit of shouting when\r\nadvancing to battle. The elephants also chimed in with their shrill and\r\nwarlike cry, in honour of Calanus. Authors upon whom reliance may be\r\nplaced, have recorded these and such-like things, facts of great import\r\nto those who are desirous of learning how steadfast and immovable a\r\nthing the human mind is in regard to what it wishes to accomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMARRIAGES BETWEEN MACEDONIANS AND PERSIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Alexander sent Atropates away to his own viceroyalty,[841]\r\nafter advancing to Susa; where he arrested Abulites and his son\r\nOxathres, and put them to death on the ground that they were governing\r\nthe Susians badly.[842] Many outrages upon temples, tombs, and the\r\nsubjects themselves had been committed by those who were ruling the\r\ncountries conquered by Alexander in war; because the king’s expedition\r\ninto India had taken a long time, and it was not thought credible that\r\nhe would ever return in safety from so many nations possessing so\r\nmany elephants, going to his destruction beyond the Indus, Hydaspes,\r\nAcesines, and Hyphasis.[843] The calamities that befell him among the\r\nGadrosians were still greater inducements to those acting as viceroys\r\nin this region to be free from apprehension of his return to his\r\ndominions. Not only so, but Alexander himself is said to have become\r\nmore inclined at that time to believe accusations which were plausible\r\nin every way, as well as to inflict very severe punishment upon those\r\nwho were convicted even of small offences, because with the same\r\ndisposition he thought they would be likely to perform great ones.[844]\r\n\r\nIn Susa also he celebrated both his own wedding and those of his\r\ncompanions. He himself married Barsine, the eldest daughter of\r\nDarius,[845] and according to Aristobulus, besides her another,\r\nParysatis, the youngest daughter of Ochus.[846] He had already married\r\nRoxana, daughter of Oxyartes the Bactrian.[847] To Hephaestion he\r\ngave Drypetis, another daughter of Darius, and his own wife’s sister;\r\nfor he wished Hephaestion’s children to be first cousins to his own.\r\nTo Craterus he gave Amastrine, daughter of Oxyartes the brother of\r\nDarius; to Perdiccas, the daughter of Atropates, viceroy of Media; to\r\nPtolemy the confidential body-guard, and Eumenes the royal secretary,\r\nthe daughters of Artabazus, to the former Artacama, and to the latter\r\nArtonis. To Nearchus he gave the daughter of Barsine and Mentor; to\r\nSeleucus the daughter of Spitamenes the Bactrian. Likewise to the rest\r\nof his Companions he gave the choicest daughters of the Persians and\r\nMedes, to the number of eighty. The weddings were celebrated after\r\nthe Persian manner, seats being placed in a row for the bridegrooms;\r\nand after the banquet the brides came in and seated themselves, each\r\none near her own husband. The bridegrooms took them by the right hand\r\nand kissed them; the king being the first to begin, for the weddings\r\nof all were conducted in the same way. This appeared the most popular\r\nthing which Alexander ever did; and it proved his affection for his\r\nCompanions. Each man took his own bride and led her away; and on all\r\nwithout exception Alexander bestowed dowries.[848] He also ordered\r\nthat the names of all the other Macedonians who had married any of the\r\nAsiatic women should be registered. They were over 10,000 in number;\r\nand to these Alexander made presents on account of their weddings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLDIERS REWARDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe now thought it a favourable opportunity to liquidate the debts of\r\nall the soldiers who had incurred them[849]; and for this purpose he\r\nordered that a register should be made of how much each man owed,\r\nin order that they might receive the money. At first only a few\r\nregistered their names, fearing that this was being instituted as a\r\ntest by Alexander, to discover which of the soldiers found their pay\r\ninsufficient for their expenses, and which of them were extravagant\r\nin their mode of living. When he was informed that most of them were\r\nnot registering their names, but that those who had borrowed money on\r\nbonds were concealing the fact, he reproached them for their distrust\r\nof him. For he said that it was not right either that the king should\r\ndeal otherwise than sincerely with his subjects, or that any of those\r\nruled by him should think that he would deal otherwise than sincerely\r\nwith them. Accordingly, he had tables placed in the camp with money\r\nupon them; and he appointed men to manage the distribution of it. He\r\nordered the debts of all who showed a money-bond to be liquidated\r\nwithout the debtors’ names being any longer registered. Consequently,\r\nthe men believed that Alexander was dealing sincerely with them; and\r\nthe fact that they were not known was a greater pleasure to them than\r\nthe fact that they ceased to be in debt. This presentation to the army\r\nis said to have amounted to 20,000 talents.[850] He also gave presents\r\nto particular individuals, according as each man was held in honour\r\nfor his merit or valour, if he had become conspicuous in crises of\r\ndanger. Those who were distinguished for their personal gallantry he\r\ncrowned with golden chaplets:—first, Peucestas, the man who had held\r\nthe shield over him; second, Leonnatus, who also had held his shield\r\nover him, and moreover had incurred dangers in India and won a victory\r\nin Ora.[851] For he had posted himself with the forces left with him\r\nagainst the Oritians and the tribes living near them, who were trying\r\nto effect a revolution, and had conquered them in battle. He also\r\nseemed to have managed other affairs in Ora with great success. In\r\naddition to these, he crowned Nearchus for his successful voyage round\r\nthe coast from the land of the Indians through the Great Sea; for\r\nthis officer had now arrived at Susa. Besides these three, he crowned\r\nOnesicritus, the pilot of the royal ship; as well as Hephaestion and\r\nthe rest of the confidential body-guards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAN ARMY OF ASIATICS TRAINED UNDER THE MACEDONIAN DISCIPLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe viceroys from the newly-built cities and the rest of the territory\r\nsubdued in war came to him, bringing with them youths just growing into\r\nmanhood to the number of 30,000, all of the same age, whom Alexander\r\ncalled Epigoni (successors).[852] They were accoutred with Macedonian\r\narms, and exercised in military discipline after the Macedonian system.\r\nThe arrival of these is said to have vexed the Macedonians, who thought\r\nthat Alexander was contriving every means in his power to free himself\r\nfrom his previous need of their services. For the same reason also\r\nthe sight of his Median dress was no small cause of dissatisfaction\r\nto them; and the weddings celebrated in the Persian fashion were\r\ndispleasing to most of them, even including some of those who married,\r\nalthough they had been greatly honoured by the king putting himself on\r\nthe same level with them in the marriage ceremony. They were offended\r\nat Peucestas, the viceroy of Persis, on account of his Persianizing\r\nboth in dress and in speech, because the king was delighted by his\r\nadopting the Asiatic customs. They were disgusted that the Bactrian,\r\nSogdianian, Arachotian, Zarangian, Arian, and Parthian horsemen, as\r\nwell as the Persian horsemen called the Evacae, were distributed\r\namong the squadrons of the Companion cavalry; as many of them at\r\nleast as were seen to excel in reputation, fineness of stature, or\r\nany other good quality; and that a fifth cavalry division was added\r\nto these troops, not composed entirely of foreigners; but the whole\r\nbody of cavalry was increased in number, and men were picked from\r\nthe foreigners and put into it. Cophen, son of Artabazus, Hydarnes\r\nand Artiboles, sons of Mazaeus, Sisines and Phradasmenes, sons of\r\nPhrataphernes, viceroy of Parthia and Hyrcania, Histanes, son of\r\nOxyartes and brother of Alexander’s wife, Roxane, as well as Autobares\r\nand his brother Mithrobaeus were picked out and enrolled among the\r\nfoot-guard in addition to the Macedonian officers. Over these Hystaspes\r\nthe Bactrian was placed as commander; and Macedonian spears were given\r\nto them instead of the barbarian javelins which had thongs attached\r\nto them.[853] All this offended the Macedonians, who thought that\r\nAlexander was becoming altogether Asiatic in his ideas, and was holding\r\nthe Macedonians themselves as well as their customs in a position of\r\ncontempt.[854]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nNAVIGATION OF THE TIGRES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander now ordered Hephaestion to lead the main body of the infantry\r\nas far as the Persian Sea, while he himself, his fleet having sailed up\r\ninto the land of Susiana, embarked with the shield-bearing guards and\r\nthe body-guard of infantry; and having also put on board a few of the\r\ncavalry Companions, he sailed down the river Eulaeus to the sea.[855]\r\nWhen he was near the place where the river discharges itself into the\r\ndeep, he left there most of his ships, including those which were in\r\nneed of repair, and with those especially adapted for fast sailing he\r\ncoasted along out of the river Eulaeus through the sea to the mouth of\r\nthe Tigres. The rest of the ships were conveyed down the Eulaeus as\r\nfar as the canal which has been cut from the Tigres into the Eulaeus,\r\nand by this means they were brought into the Tigres. Of the rivers\r\nEuphrates and Tigres which enclose Syria between them, whence also\r\nits name is called by the natives Mesopotamia,[856] the Tigres flows\r\nin a much lower channel than the Euphrates, from which it receives\r\nmany canals; and after taking up many tributaries and its waters being\r\nswelled by them, it falls into the Persian Sea.[857] It is a large\r\nriver and can be crossed on foot nowhere as far as its mouth,[858]\r\ninasmuch as none of its water is used up by irrigation of the country.\r\nFor the land through which it flows is more elevated than its water,\r\nand it is not drawn off into canals or into another river, but rather\r\nreceives them into itself. It is nowhere possible to irrigate the\r\nland from it. But the Euphrates flows in an elevated channel, and is\r\neverywhere on a level with the land through which it passes. Many\r\ncanals have been made from it, some of which are always kept flowing,\r\nand from which the inhabitants on both banks supply themselves with\r\nwater; others the people make only when requisite to irrigate the land,\r\nwhen they are in need of water from drought.[859] For this country is\r\nusually free from rain. The consequence is, that the Euphrates at\r\nlast has only a small volume of water, which disappears into a marsh.\r\nAlexander sailed over the sea round the shore of the Persian Gulf lying\r\nbetween the rivers Eulaeus and Tigres; and thence he sailed up the\r\nlatter river as far as the camp where Hephaestion had settled with all\r\nhis forces. Thence he sailed again to Opis, a city situated on that\r\nriver.[860] In his voyage up he destroyed the weirs which existed in\r\nthe river, and thus made the stream quite level. These weirs had been\r\nconstructed by the Persians, to prevent any enemy having a superior\r\nnaval force from sailing up from the sea into their country. The\r\nPersians had had recourse to these contrivances because they were not\r\na nautical people; and thus by making an unbroken succession of weirs\r\nthey had rendered the voyage up the Tigres a matter of impossibility.\r\nBut Alexander said that such devices were unbecoming to men who are\r\nvictorious in battle; and therefore he considered this means of safety\r\nunsuitable for him; and by easily demolishing the laborious work of the\r\nPersians, he proved in fact that what they thought a protection was\r\nunworthy of the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MACEDONIANS OFFENDED AT ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at Opis, he collected the Macedonians and announced\r\nthat he intended to discharge from the army those who were useless for\r\nmilitary service either from age or from being maimed in the limbs;\r\nand he said he would send them back to their own abodes. He also\r\npromised to give those who went back as much as would make them special\r\nobjects of envy to those at home and arouse in the other Macedonians\r\nthe wish to share similar dangers and labours. Alexander said this,\r\nno doubt, for the purpose of pleasing the Macedonians; but on the\r\ncontrary they were, not without reason, offended by the speech which\r\nhe delivered, thinking that now they were despised by him and deemed\r\nto be quite useless for military service. Indeed, throughout the whole\r\nof this expedition they had been offended at many other things; for\r\nhis adoption of the Persian dress, thereby exhibiting his contempt\r\nfor their opinion, caused them grief, as did also his accoutring the\r\nforeign soldiers called Epigoni in the Macedonian style, and the mixing\r\nof the alien horsemen among the ranks of the Companions. Therefore\r\nthey could not remain silent and control themselves, but urged him to\r\ndismiss all of them from his army; and they advised him to prosecute\r\nthe war in company with his father, deriding Ammon by this remark. When\r\nAlexander heard this (for at that time he was more hasty in temper than\r\nheretofore, and no longer, as of old, indulgent to the Macedonians from\r\nhaving a retinue of foreign attendants), leaping down from the platform\r\nwith his officers around him, he ordered the most conspicuous of the\r\nmen who had tried to stir up the multitude to sedition to be arrested.\r\nHe himself pointed out with his hand to the shield-bearing guards those\r\nwhom they were to arrest, to the number of thirteen; and he ordered\r\nthese to be led away to execution.[861] When the rest, stricken with\r\nterror, became silent, he mounted the platform and spoke as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The speech which I am about to deliver will not be for the purpose\r\nof checking your start homeward, for, so far as I am concerned, you\r\nmay depart wherever you wish; but because I wish you to know what\r\nkind of men you were originally and how you have been transformed\r\nsince you came into our service. In the first place, as is reasonable,\r\nI shall begin my speech from my father Philip. For he found you\r\nvagabonds and destitute of means, most of you clad in hides, feeding\r\na few sheep up the mountain sides, for the protection of which you\r\nhad to fight with small success against Illyrians, Triballians, and\r\nthe border Thracians.[862] Instead of the hides he gave you cloaks\r\nto wear, and from the mountains he led you down into the plains, and\r\nmade you capable of fighting the neighbouring barbarians, so that you\r\nwere no longer compelled to preserve yourselves by trusting rather\r\nto the inaccessible strongholds than to your own valour. He made you\r\ncolonists of cities, which he adorned with useful laws and customs;\r\nand from being slaves and subjects, he made you rulers over those\r\nvery barbarians by whom you yourselves, as well as your property,\r\nwere previously liable to be plundered and ravaged. He also added\r\nthe greater part of Thrace to Macedonia, and by seizing the most\r\nconveniently situated places on the sea-coast, he spread abundance\r\nover the land from commerce, and made the working of the mines a\r\nsecure employment.[863] He made you rulers over the Thessalians,\r\nof whom you had formerly been in mortal fear[864]; and by humbling\r\nthe nation of the Phocians, he rendered the avenue into Greece\r\nbroad and easy for you, instead of being narrow and difficult.[865]\r\nThe Athenians and Thebans, who were always lying in wait to attack\r\nMacedonia, he humbled to such a degree,—I also then rendering him my\r\npersonal aid in the campaign,[866]—that instead of paying tribute to\r\nthe former[867] and being vassals to the latter,[868] those States\r\nin their turn procure security to themselves by our assistance. He\r\npenetrated into the Peloponnese, and after regulating its affairs,\r\nwas publicly declared commander-in-chief of all the rest of Greece\r\nin the expedition against the Persian, adding this glory not more to\r\nhimself than to the commonwealth of the Macedonians. These were the\r\nadvantages which accrued to you from my father Philip; great indeed\r\nif looked at by themselves, but small if compared with those you\r\nhave obtained from me. For though I inherited from my father only a\r\nfew gold and silver goblets, and there were not even sixty talents\r\nin the treasury, and though I found myself charged with a debt of\r\n500 talents owing by Philip,[869] and I was obliged myself to borrow\r\n800 talents in addition to these, I started from the country which\r\ncould not decently support you, and forthwith laid open to you the\r\npassage of the Hellespont, though at that time the Persians held the\r\nsovereignty of the sea. Having overpowered the viceroys of Darius\r\nwith my cavalry, I added to your empire the whole of Ionia,[870] the\r\nwhole of Aeolis, both Phrygias[871] and Lydia, and I took Miletus by\r\nsiege. All the other places I gained by voluntary surrender, and I\r\ngranted you the privilege of appropriating the wealth found in them.\r\nThe riches of Egypt and Cyrene, which I acquired without fighting a\r\nbattle, have come to you. Coele-Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia are\r\nyour property. Babylon, Bactra, and Susa are yours. The wealth of the\r\nLydians, the treasures of the Persians, and the riches of the Indians\r\nare yours; and so is the External Sea. You are viceroys, you are\r\ngenerals, you are captains. What then have I reserved to myself after\r\nall these labours, except this purple robe and this diadem?[872] I have\r\nappropriated nothing myself, nor can any one point out my treasures,\r\nexcept these possessions of yours or the things which I am guarding\r\non your behalf.[873] Individually, however, I have no motive to guard\r\nthem, since I feed on the same fare as you do, and I take only the same\r\namount of sleep. Nay, I do not think that my fare is as good as that of\r\nthose among you who live luxuriously; and I know that I often sit up at\r\nnight to watch for you, that you may be able to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S SPEECH (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n“But some one may say, that while you endured toil and fatigue, I have\r\nacquired these things as your leader without myself sharing the toil\r\nand fatigue. But who is there of you who knows that he has endured\r\ngreater toil for me than I have for him? Come now! whoever of you has\r\nwounds, let him strip and show them, and I will show mine in turn;\r\nfor there is no part of my body, in front at any rate, remaining free\r\nfrom wounds; nor is there any kind of weapon used either for close\r\ncombat or for hurling at the enemy, the traces of which I do not bear\r\non my person. For I have been wounded with the sword in close fight,\r\nI have been shot with arrows, and I have been struck with missiles\r\nprojected from engines of war; and though oftentimes I have been hit\r\nwith stones and bolts of wood for the sake of your lives, your glory,\r\nand your wealth, I am still leading you as conquerors over all the\r\nland and sea, all rivers, mountains, and plains. I have celebrated\r\nyour weddings with my own, and the children of many of you will be\r\nakin to my children. Moreover I have liquidated the debts of all those\r\nwho had incurred them, without inquiring too closely for what purpose\r\nthey were contracted, though you receive such high pay, and carry off\r\nso much booty whenever there is booty to be got after a siege. Most\r\nof you have golden crowns, the eternal memorials of your valour and\r\nof the honour you receive from me. Whoever has been killed, has met\r\nwith a glorious end and has been honoured with a splendid burial.\r\nBrazen statues of most of the slain have been erected at home,[874]\r\nand their parents are held in honour, being released from all public\r\nservice and from taxation. But no one of you has ever been killed\r\nin flight under my leadership. And now I was intending to send back\r\nthose of you who are unfit for service, objects of envy to those at\r\nhome; but since you all wish to depart, depart all of you! Go back and\r\nreport at home that your king Alexander, the conqueror of the Persians,\r\nMedes, Bactrians, and Sacians[875]; the man who has subjugated the\r\nUxians, Arachotians, and Drangians; who has also acquired the rule\r\nof the Parthians, Chorasmians, and Hyrcanians, as far as the Caspian\r\nSea; who has marched over the Caucasus, through the Caspian Gates; who\r\nhas crossed the rivers Oxus and Tanais, and the Indus besides, which\r\nhas never been crossed by any one else except Dionysus; who has also\r\ncrossed the Hydaspes, Acesines, and Hydraotes, and who would have\r\ncrossed the Hyphasis, if you had not shrunk back with alarm; who has\r\npenetrated into the Great Sea by both the mouths of the Indus; who\r\nhas marched through the desert of Gadrosia, where no one ever before\r\nmarched with an army; who on his route acquired possession of Carmania\r\nand the land of the Oritians, in addition to his other conquests, his\r\nfleet having in the meantime already sailed round the coast of the sea\r\nwhich extends from India to Persia—report that when you returned to\r\nSusa you deserted him and went away, handing him over to the protection\r\nof conquered foreigners. Perhaps this report of yours will be both\r\nglorious to you in the eyes of men and devout forsooth in the eyes of\r\nthe gods. Depart!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nRECONCILIATION BETWEEN ALEXANDER AND HIS ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, he leaped down quickly from the platform, and\r\nentered the palace, where he paid no attention to the decoration of\r\nhis person, nor was any of his Companions admitted to see him. Not\r\neven on the morrow was any one of them admitted to an audience; but\r\non the third day he summoned the select Persians within, and among\r\nthem he distributed the commands of the brigades, and made the rule\r\nthat only those whom he had proclaimed his kinsmen,[876] should have\r\nthe honour of saluting him with a kiss.[877] But the Macedonians\r\nwho heard the speech were thoroughly astonished at the moment, and\r\nremained there in silence near the platform; nor when he retired did\r\nany of them accompany the king, except his personal Companions and\r\nthe confidential body-guards. Though they remained, most of them had\r\nnothing to do or say; and yet they were unwilling to retire. But when\r\nthe news was reported to them about the Persians and Medes, that the\r\nmilitary commands were being given to Persians, that the foreign\r\nsoldiers were being selected and divided into companies, that a Persian\r\nfoot-guard, Persian foot Companions, a Persian regiment of men with\r\nsilver shields,[878] as well as the cavalry Companions, and another\r\nroyal regiment of cavalry distinct from these, were being called by\r\nMacedonian names, they were no longer able to restrain themselves;\r\nbut running in a body to the palace, they cast their weapons there in\r\nfront of the gates as a sign of supplication to the king. Standing in\r\nfront of the gates, they shouted, beseeching to be allowed to enter,\r\nand saying that they were willing to surrender the men who had been\r\nthe instigators of the disturbance on that occasion, and those who\r\nhad begun the clamour. They also declared they would not retire from\r\nthe gates either day or night, unless Alexander would take some pity\r\nupon them. When he was informed of this, he came out without delay;\r\nand seeing them lying on the ground in humble guise, and hearing most\r\nof them lamenting with loud voice, tears began to flow also from\r\nhis own eyes. He made an effort to say something to them, but they\r\ncontinued their importunate entreaties.[879] At length one of them,\r\nCallines by name, a man conspicuous both for his age and because he\r\nwas captain of the Companion cavalry, spoke as follows:—“O king, what\r\ngrieves the Macedonians is, that thou hast already made some of the\r\nPersians kinsmen to thyself, and that Persians are called Alexander’s\r\nkinsmen, and have the honour of saluting thee with a kiss; whereas none\r\nof the Macedonians have as yet enjoyed this honour.” Then Alexander\r\ninterrupting him, said:—“But all of you without exception I consider\r\nmy kinsmen, and so from this time I shall call you.” When he had said\r\nthis, Callines advanced and saluted him with a kiss, and so did all\r\nthose who wished to salute him. Then they took up their weapons and\r\nreturned to the camp, shouting and singing a song of thanksgiving to\r\nApollo. After this Alexander offered sacrifice to the gods to whom it\r\nwas his custom to sacrifice, and gave a public banquet, over which he\r\nhimself presided, with the Macedonians sitting around him; and next\r\nto them the Persians; after whom came the men of the other nations,\r\nhonoured for their personal rank or for some meritorious action. The\r\nking and his guests drew wine from the same bowl and poured out the\r\nsame libations, both the Grecian prophets and the Magians commencing\r\nthe ceremony. He prayed for other blessings, and especially that\r\nharmony and community of rule might exist between the Macedonians and\r\nPersians. The common account is, that those who took part in this\r\nbanquet were 9,000 in number, that all of them poured out one libation,\r\nand after it sang a song of thanksgiving to Apollo.[880]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTEN THOUSAND MACEDONIANS SENT HOME WITH CRATERUS.—DISPUTES BETWEEN\r\nANTIPATER AND OLYMPIAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen those of the Macedonians who were unfit for service on account\r\nof age or any other misfortune, went back of their own accord, to the\r\nnumber of about 10,000. To these Alexander gave the pay not only for\r\nthe time which had already elapsed, but also for that which they would\r\nspend in returning home. He also gave to each man a talent in addition\r\nto his pay.[881] If any of them had children by Asiatic wives, he\r\nordered them to leave them behind with him, lest they should introduce\r\ninto Macedonia a cause of discord, taking with them children by foreign\r\nwomen who were of a different race from the children whom they had left\r\nbehind at home born of Macedonian mothers. He promised to take care\r\nthat they should be brought up as Macedonians, educating them not only\r\nin general matters but also in the art of war. He also undertook to\r\nlead them into Macedonia when they arrived at manhood, and hand them\r\nover to their fathers. These uncertain and obscure promises were made\r\nto them as they were departing; and he thought he was giving a most\r\nindubitable proof of the friendship and affection he had for them by\r\nsending with them, as their guardian and the leader of the expedition,\r\nCraterus, the man most faithful to him, and whom he valued equally with\r\nhimself.[882] Then, having saluted them all, he with tears dismissed\r\nthem likewise weeping from his presence. He ordered Craterus[883] to\r\nlead these men back, and when he had done so, to take upon himself the\r\ngovernment of Macedonia, Thrace, and Thessaly, and to preside over the\r\nfreedom of the Greeks. He also ordered Antipater to bring to him the\r\nMacedonians of manly age as successors to those who were being sent\r\nback. He despatched Polysperchon also with Craterus, as his second in\r\ncommand, so that if any mishap befell Craterus on the march (for he\r\nwas sending him back on account of the weakness of his health), those\r\nwho were going might not be in need of a general.[884] A secret report\r\nwas also going about that Alexander was now overcome by his mother’s\r\naccusations of Antipater, and that he wished to remove him from\r\nMacedonia.[885] This report was current among those who thought that\r\nroyal actions are more worthy of honour in proportion to their secrecy,\r\nand who were inclined to impute what is worthy of belief to a bad\r\nmotive rather than to attribute it to the real one; a course to which\r\nthey were led by appearances and their own depravity. But probably this\r\nsending for Antipater was not designed for his dishonour, but rather\r\nto prevent any unpleasant consequences to Antipater and Olympias from\r\ntheir quarrel which he might not himself be able to rectify. For they\r\nwere incessantly writing to Alexander, the former saying that the\r\narrogance, acerbity, and meddlesomeness of Olympias was exceedingly\r\nunbecoming to the king’s mother; insomuch that Alexander was related\r\nto have used the following remark in reference to the reports which\r\nhe received about his mother:—that she was exacting from him a heavy\r\nhouse-rent for the ten months.[886] The queen wrote that Antipater\r\nwas overweeningly insolent in his pretensions and in the service of\r\nhis court, no longer remembering the one who had appointed him, but\r\nclaiming to win and hold the first rank[887] among the Macedonians and\r\nGreeks. These slanderous reports about Antipater appeared to have more\r\nweight with Alexander, since they were more formidable in regard to the\r\nregal dignity. However no overt act or word of the king was reported,\r\nfrom which any one could infer that Antipater was in any way less in\r\nfavour with him than before.[888]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE NISAEAN PLAIN.—THE AMAZONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that Hephaestion much against his will yielded to this\r\nargument and was reconciled to Eumenes, who on his part wished to\r\nsettle the dispute.[889] In this journey[890] Alexander is said to\r\nhave seen the plain which was devoted to the royal mares. Herodotus\r\nsays that the plain itself was named Nisaean, and that the mares were\r\ncalled Nisaean[891]; adding that in olden times there were 150,000\r\nof these horses. But at this time Alexander found not many above\r\n50,000; for most of them had been carried off by robbers. They say\r\nthat Atropates, the viceroy of Media, gave him a hundred women, saying\r\nthat they were of the race of Amazons.[892] These had been equipped\r\nwith the arms of male horsemen, except that they carried axes instead\r\nof spears and targets instead of shields. They also say that they had\r\nthe right breast smaller than the left, and that they exposed it in\r\nbattle. Alexander dismissed them from the army, that no attempt to\r\nviolate them might be made by the Macedonians or barbarians; and he\r\nordered them to carry word to their queen that he was coming to her\r\nin order to procreate children by her.[893] But this story has been\r\nrecorded neither by Aristobulus nor Ptolemy, nor any other writer who\r\nis a trustworthy authority on such matters. I do not even think that\r\nthe race of Amazons was surviving at that time; for before Alexander’s\r\ntime they were not mentioned even by Xenophon,[894] who mentions the\r\nPhasians, Colchians, and all the other barbaric races which the Greeks\r\ncame upon, when they started from Trapezus or before they marched down\r\nto Trapezus. They would certainly have fallen in with the Amazons if\r\nthey were still in existence. However it does not seem to me credible\r\nthat this race of women was altogether fictitious, because it has been\r\ncelebrated by so many famous poets. For the general account is, that\r\nHeracles marched against them and brought the girdle of their queen\r\nHippolyte into Greece.[895] The Athenians also under Theseus were the\r\nfirst to conquer and repulse these women as they were advancing into\r\nEurope[896]; and the battle of the Athenians and Amazons has been\r\npainted by Micon,[897] no less than that of the Athenians and Persians.\r\nHerodotus also has frequently written about these women[898]; and so\r\nhave the Athenian writers who have honoured the men who perished in\r\nwar with funeral orations. They have mentioned the exploit of the\r\nAthenians against the Amazons as one of their special glories.[899]\r\nIf therefore Atropates showed any equestrian women to Alexander, I\r\nthink he must have shown him some other foreign women trained in\r\nhorsemanship, and equipped with the arms which were said to be those of\r\nthe Amazons.[900]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF HEPHAESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ecbatana Alexander offered sacrifice according to his custom, for\r\ngood fortune; and he celebrated a gymnastic and musical contest.\r\nHe also held drinking parties with his Companions. At this time\r\nHephaestion fell sick; and they say that the stadium was full of people\r\non the seventh day of his fever, for on that day there was a gymnastic\r\ncontest for boys. When Alexander was informed that Hephaestion was\r\nin a critical state, he went to him without delay, but found him no\r\nlonger alive.[901] Different authors have given different accounts\r\nof Alexander’s grief on this occasion; but they agree in this, that\r\nhis grief was great. As to what was done in honour of Hephaestion,\r\nthey make diverse statements, just as each writer was actuated by\r\ngood-will or envy towards him, or even towards Alexander himself. Of\r\nthe authors who have made these reckless statements, some seem to\r\nme to have thought that whatever Alexander said or did to show his\r\nexcessive grief for the man who was the dearest to him in the world,\r\nredounds to his own honour; whereas others seem to have thought that\r\nit rather tended to his disgrace, as being conduct unbecoming to any\r\nking and especially to Alexander. Some say that he lay prostrate on his\r\ncompanion’s body for the greater part of that day, bewailing him and\r\nrefusing to depart from him, until he was forcibly carried away by his\r\nCompanions. Others that he lay upon the body the whole day and night.\r\nOthers again say that he hanged the physician Glaucias, for having\r\nindiscreetly given the medicine[902]; while others affirm that he,\r\nbeing a spectator of the games, neglected Hephaestion, who was filled\r\nwith wine. That Alexander should have cut off his hair in honour of\r\nthe dead man, I do not think improbable, both for other reasons and\r\nespecially from a desire to imitate Achilles, whom from his boyhood he\r\nhad an ambition to rival.[903] Others also say that Alexander himself\r\nat one time drove the chariot on which the body was borne; but this\r\nstatement I by no means believe. Others again affirm that he ordered\r\nthe shrine of Asclepius in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground; which\r\nwas an act of barbarism, and by no means in harmony with Alexander’s\r\ngeneral behaviour, but rather in accordance with the arrogance of\r\nXerxes in his dealings with the deity, who is said to have let fetters\r\ndown into the Hellespont, in order to punish it forsooth.[904] But\r\nthe following statement, which has been recorded, does not seem to me\r\nentirely beyond the range of probability:—that when Alexander was\r\nmarching to Babylon, he was met on the road by many embassies from\r\nGreece, among which were some Epidaurian envoys, who obtained from him\r\ntheir requests.[905] He also gave them an offering to be conveyed to\r\nAsclepius, adding this remark:—“Although Asclepius has not treated me\r\nfairly, in not saving the life of my Companion, whom I valued equally\r\nwith my own head.”[906] It has been stated by most writers that he\r\nordered honours to be always paid to Hephaestion as a hero; and some\r\nsay that he even sent men to Ammon’s temple to ask the god if it were\r\nallowable to offer sacrifice to Hephaestion as a god; but Ammon replied\r\nthat it was not allowable. All the authorities, however, agree as to\r\nthe following facts:—that until the third day after Hephaestion’s\r\ndeath, Alexander neither tasted food nor paid any attention to his\r\npersonal appearance, but lay on the ground either bewailing or silently\r\nmourning; that he also ordered a funeral pyre to be prepared for him\r\nin Babylon at the expense of 10,000 talents; some say at a still\r\ngreater cost[907]; that a decree was published throughout all the\r\nbarbarian territory for the observance of a public mourning.[908] Many\r\nof Alexander’s Companions dedicated themselves and their arms to the\r\ndead Hephaestion in order to show their respect to him; and the first\r\nto begin the artifice was Eumenes, whom we a short time ago mentioned\r\nas having been at variance with him.[909] This he did that Alexander\r\nmight not think he was pleased at Hephaestion’s death. Alexander did\r\nnot appoint any one else to be commander of the Companion cavalry in\r\nthe place of Hephaestion, so that the name of that general might not\r\nperish from the brigade; but that division of cavalry was still called\r\nHephaestion’s and the figure made from Hephaestion went in front of\r\nit. He also resolved to celebrate a gymnastic and musical contest,\r\nmuch more magnificent than any of the preceding, both in the multitude\r\nof competitors and in the amount of money expended upon it. For he\r\nprovided 3,000 competitors in all; and it is said that these men a\r\nshort time after also competed in the games held at Alexander’s own\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nSUBJUGATION OF THE COSSAEANS.—EMBASSIES FROM DISTANT NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mourning was prolonged for many days; and as he was now beginning\r\nto recall himself from it, under such circumstances his Companions\r\nhad less difficulty in rousing him to action. Then at length he made\r\nan expedition against the Cossaeans,[910] a warlike race bordering on\r\nthe territory of the Uxians. They are mountaineers, inhabiting strong\r\npositions in separate villages. Whenever a force approached them,\r\nthey were in the habit of retiring to the summits of their mountains,\r\neither in a body or separately as each man found it practicable; and\r\nthus they escaped, making it difficult for those who attacked them\r\nwith their forces to come near them. After the enemy’s departure,\r\nthey used to turn themselves again to marauding, by which occupation\r\nthey supported themselves. But Alexander subdued this race, though he\r\nmarched against them in the winter; for neither winter nor ruggedness\r\nof ground was any impediment either to him or to Ptolemy, son of\r\nLagus, who led a part of the army in the campaign against them. Thus no\r\nmilitary enterprise which Alexander undertook was ever unsuccessful.\r\nAs he was marching back to Babylon, he was met by embassies from the\r\nLibyans, who congratulated him and crowned him as conqueror of the\r\nkingdom of Asia.[911] From Italy also came Bruttians, Lucanians, and\r\nTyrrhenians[912] as envoys, for the same purpose. The Carthaginians\r\nare said to have sent an embassy to him at this time[913]; and it is\r\nalso asserted that envoys came to request his friendship from the\r\nEthiopians, the Scythians of Europe, the Gauls, and Iberians—nations\r\nwhose names were heard and their accoutrements seen then for the first\r\ntime by Greeks and Macedonians. They are also said to have entrusted\r\nto Alexander the duty of settling their disputes with each other. Then\r\nindeed it was especially evident both to himself and to those about\r\nhim that he was lord of all the land and sea.[914] Of the men who have\r\nwritten the history of Alexander, Aristus and Asclepiades[915] alone\r\nsay that the Romans also sent an embassy to him, and that when he met\r\ntheir embassy, he predicted something of the future power of Rome,\r\nobserving both the attire of the men, their love of labour, and their\r\ndevotion to freedom. At the same time he made urgent inquiries about\r\ntheir political constitution. This incident I have recorded neither\r\nas certainly authentic nor as altogether incredible; but none of the\r\nRoman writers have made any mention of this embassy having been\r\ndespatched to Alexander; nor of those who have written an account of\r\nAlexander’s actions, has either Ptolemy, son of Lagus, or Aristobulus\r\nmentioned it. With these authors I am generally inclined to agree. Nor\r\ndoes it seem likely that the Roman republic, which was at that time\r\nremarkable for its love of liberty, would send an embassy to a foreign\r\nking, especially to a place so far away from their own land, when they\r\nwere not compelled to do so by fear or any hope of advantage, being\r\npossessed as they were beyond any other people by hatred to the very\r\nname and race of despots.[916]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION OF THE CASPIAN.—THE CHALDAEAN SOOTHSAYERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, Alexander sent Heraclides, son of Argaeus, into Hyrcania\r\nin command of a company of shipwrights, with orders to cut timber from\r\nthe Hyrcanian mountains and with it to construct a number of ships of\r\nwar, some without decks and others with decks after the Grecian fashion\r\nof ship-building.[917] For he was very desirous of discovering with\r\nwhat sea the one called the Hyrcanian or Caspian unites; whether it\r\ncommunicates with the water of the Euxine Sea, or whether the Great\r\nSea comes right round from the Eastern Sea, which is near India and\r\nflows up into the Hyrcanian Gulf; just as he had discovered that the\r\nPersian Sea, which was called the Red Sea, is really a gulf of the\r\nGreat Sea.[918] For the sources of the Caspian Sea had not yet been\r\ndiscovered, although many nations dwell around it, and navigable rivers\r\ndischarge their waters into it. From Bactria, the Oxus, the largest of\r\nAsiatic rivers, those of India excepted, discharges itself into this\r\nsea[919]; and through Scythia flows the Jaxartes.[920] The general\r\naccount is, that the Araxes also, which flows from Armenia, falls into\r\nthe same sea.[921] These are the largest; but many others flow into\r\nthese, while others again discharge themselves directly into this\r\nsea. Some of these were known to those who visited these nations with\r\nAlexander; others are situated towards the farther side of the gulf, as\r\nit seems, in the country of the Nomadic Scythians, a district which is\r\nquite unknown.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander had crossed the river Tigres with his army and was\r\nmarching to Babylon, he was met by the Chaldaean philosophers[922];\r\nwho, having led him away from his Companions, besought him to suspend\r\nhis march to that city. For they said that an oracular declaration had\r\nbeen made to them by the god Belus, that his entrance into Babylon at\r\nthat time would not be for his good. But he answered their speech with\r\na line from the poet Euripides to this effect: “He the best prophet\r\nis that guesses well.”[923] But said the Chaldaeans:—“O king, do not\r\nat any rate enter the city looking towards the west, nor leading the\r\narmy advancing in that direction; but rather go right round towards the\r\neast.” But this did not turn out to be easy for him, on account of the\r\ndifficulty of the ground; for the deity was leading him to the place\r\nwhere entering he was doomed soon to die. And perhaps it was better for\r\nhim to be taken off in the very acme of his glory as well as of the\r\naffection entertained for him by men, before any of the vicissitudes\r\nnatural to man befell him. Probably this was the reason Solon advised\r\nCroesus to look at the end of a long life, and not before pronounce\r\nany man happy.[924] Yea indeed, Hephaestion’s death had been no small\r\nmisfortune to Alexander; and I think he would rather have departed\r\nbefore it occurred than have been alive to experience it; no less than\r\nAchilles, as it seems to me, would rather have died before Patroclus\r\nthan have been the avenger of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE ADVICE OF THE CHALDEES REJECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he had a suspicion that the Chaldaeans were trying to prevent his\r\nentrance into Babylon at that time with reference rather to their own\r\nadvantage than to the declaration of the oracle. For in the middle of\r\nthe city of the Babylonians was the temple of Belus,[925] an edifice\r\nvery great in size, constructed of baked bricks which were cemented\r\ntogether with bitumen. This temple had been razed to the ground by\r\nXerxes, when he returned from Greece; as were also all the other sacred\r\nbuildings of the Babylonians. Some say that Alexander had formed the\r\nresolution to rebuild it upon the former foundations; and for this\r\nreason he ordered the Babylonians to carry away the mound. Others say\r\nthat he intended to build a still larger one than that which formerly\r\nexisted.[926] But after his departure, the men who had been entrusted\r\nwith the work prosecuted it without any vigour, so that he determined\r\nto employ the whole of his army in completing it. A great quantity\r\nof land as well as gold had been dedicated to the god Belus by the\r\nAssyrian kings; and in olden times the temple was kept in repair and\r\nsacrifices were offered to the god. But at that time the Chaldaeans\r\nwere appropriating the property of the god, since nothing existed upon\r\nwhich the revenues could be expended. Alexander suspected that they did\r\nnot wish him to enter Babylon for this reason, for fear that in a short\r\ntime the temple would be finished, and they should be deprived of the\r\ngains accruing from the money. And yet, according to Aristobulus, he\r\nwas willing to yield to their persuasions so far at least as to change\r\nthe direction of his entry into the city. For this purpose, on the\r\nfirst day he encamped near the river Euphrates; and on the next day he\r\nmarched along the bank, keeping the river on his right hand, with the\r\nintention of passing beyond the part of the city turned towards the\r\nwest, and there wheeling round to lead his army towards the east. But\r\non account of the difficulty of the ground he could not march with his\r\narmy in this direction; because if a man who is entering the city from\r\nthe west, here changes his direction eastward, he comes upon ground\r\ncovered with marshes and shoals. Thus, partly by his own will and\r\npartly against his will, he disobeyed the god.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nPREDICTIONS OF ALEXANDER’S DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover Aristobulus has recorded the following story. Apollodorus\r\nthe Amphipolitan, one of Alexander’s Companions, was general of the\r\narmy which the king left with Mazaeus, the viceroy of Babylon.[927]\r\nWhen he joined his forces with the king’s on the return of the\r\nlatter from India, and observed that he was severely punishing the\r\nviceroys who had been placed over the several countries, he sent to\r\nhis brother Peithagoras and asked him to divine about his safety. For\r\nPeithagoras was a diviner who derived his knowledge of the future from\r\nthe inspection of the inward parts of animals. This man sent back to\r\nApollodorus, inquiring of whom he was so especially afraid, as to\r\nwish to consult divination. The latter wrote back: “The king himself\r\nand Hephaestion.” Peithagoras therefore in the first place offered\r\nsacrifice with reference to Hephaestion. But as there was no lobe\r\nvisible upon the liver of the sacrificial victim,[928] he stated this\r\nfact in a letter, which he sealed and sent to his brother from Babylon\r\nto Ecbatana, explaining that there was no reason at all to be afraid\r\nof Hephaestion, for in a short time he would be out of their way. And\r\nAristobulus says that Apollodorus received this epistle only one day\r\nbefore Hephaestion died. Then Peithagoras again offered sacrifice in\r\nrespect to Alexander, and the liver of the victim consulted in respect\r\nto him was also destitute of a lobe. He therefore wrote to Apollodorus\r\nto the same purport about Alexander as about Hephaestion. Apollodorus\r\ndid not conceal the information sent to him, but told Alexander, in\r\norder the more to show his good-will to the king, if he urged him to\r\nbe on his guard lest some danger might befall him at that time. And\r\nAristobulus says that the king commended Apollodorus, and when he\r\nentered Babylon, he asked Peithagoras what sign he had met with, to\r\ninduce him to write thus to his brother. He said that the liver of the\r\nvictim sacrificed for him was without a lobe. When Alexander asked what\r\nthe sign portended, he said that it was a very disastrous one. The\r\nking was so far from being angry with him, that he even treated him\r\nwith greater respect, for telling him the truth without any disguise.\r\nAristobulus says that he himself heard this story from Peithagoras; and\r\nadds that the same man acted as diviner for Perdiccas and afterwards\r\nfor Antigonus, and that the same sign occurred for both. It was\r\nverified by fact; for Perdiccas lost his life leading an army against\r\nPtolemy,[929] and Antigonus was killed in the battle fought by him at\r\nIpsus against Seleucus and Lysimachus.[930] Also concerning Calanus,\r\nthe Indian philosopher, the following story has been recorded. When he\r\nwas going to the funeral pyre to die, he gave the parting salutation\r\nto all his other companions; but he refused to approach Alexander to\r\ngive him the salutation, saying he would meet him at Babylon and there\r\nsalute him. At the time indeed this remark was treated with neglect;\r\nbut afterwards, when Alexander had died at Babylon, it came to the\r\nrecollection of those who had heard it, and they thought forsooth that\r\nit was a divine intimation of Alexander’s approaching end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nEMBASSIES FROM GREECE.—FLEET PREPARED FOR INVADING ARABIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he was entering Babylon, he was met by embassies from the Greeks;\r\nbut for what purpose each embassy was sent has not been recorded.[931]\r\nTo me indeed it seems probable that most of them came to crown and\r\neulogize him on account of his victories, especially the Indian ones,\r\nas well as to say that the Greeks rejoiced at his safe return from\r\nIndia. It is said that he greeted these men with the right hand, and\r\nafter paying them suitable honour sent them back. He also gave the\r\nambassadors permission to take with them all the statues of men and\r\nimages of gods and the other votive offerings which Xerxes had carried\r\noff from Greece to Babylon, Pasargadae, Susa, or any other place in\r\nAsia. In this way it is said that the brazen statues of Harmodius and\r\nAristogeiton,[932] as well as the monument of the Celcaean Artemis,\r\nwere carried back to Athens.[933]\r\n\r\nAristobulus says that he found at Babylon the fleet with Nearchus,\r\nwhich had sailed from the Persian Sea up the river Euphrates; and\r\nanother which had been conveyed from Phoenicia, consisting of two\r\nPhoenician quinqueremes, three quadriremes, twelve triremes, and thirty\r\ntriacontors. These had been taken to pieces and conveyed to the river\r\nEuphrates from Phoenicia to the city of Thapsacus. There they were\r\njoined together again and sailed down to Babylon. The same writer\r\nsays that he cut down the cypresses in Babylonia and with them built\r\nanother fleet; for in the land of the Assyrians these trees alone are\r\nabundant, but of the other things necessary for ship-building this\r\ncountry affords no supply. A multitude of purple-fishers and other\r\nsea-faring men came to him from Phoenicia and the rest of the seaboard\r\nto serve as crews for the ships and perform the other services on\r\nboard. Near Babylon he made a harbour by excavation large enough to\r\nafford anchorage to 1,000 ships of war; and adjoining the harbour\r\nhe made dockyards. Miccalus the Clazomenian[934] was despatched to\r\nPhoenicia and Syria with 500 talents[935] to enlist some men and to\r\npurchase others who were experienced in nautical affairs. For Alexander\r\ndesigned to colonize the seaboard near the Persian Gulf, as well as\r\nthe islands in that sea. For he thought that this land would become no\r\nless prosperous than Phoenicia. He made these preparations of the fleet\r\nto attack the main body of the Arabs,[936] under the pretext that they\r\nwere the only barbarians of this region who had not sent an embassy to\r\nhim or done anything else becoming their position and showing respect\r\nto him. But the truth was, as it seems to me, that Alexander was\r\ninsatiably ambitious of acquiring fresh territory.[937]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ARABIA.—VOYAGE OF NEARCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common report is, that he heard that the Arabs venerated only\r\ntwo gods, Uranus and Dionysus[938]; the former because he is visible\r\nand contains in himself the heavenly luminaries, especially the sun,\r\nfrom which emanates the greatest and most evident benefit to all\r\nthings human; and the latter on account of the fame he acquired by his\r\nexpedition into India. Therefore he thought himself quite worthy to be\r\nconsidered by the Arabs as a third god, since he had performed deeds\r\nby no means inferior to those of Dionysus. If then he could conquer\r\nthe Arabs, he intended to grant them the privilege of conducting their\r\ngovernment according to their own customs, as he had already done to\r\nthe Indians. The fertility of the land was a secret inducement to him\r\nto invade it; because he heard that the people obtained cassia from the\r\nlakes, and myrrh and frankincense from the trees; that cinnamon was\r\ncut from the shrubs, and that the meadows produce spikenard without\r\nany cultivation.[939] As to the size of the country, he was informed\r\nthat the seaboard of Arabia was not less in extent than that of India;\r\nthat near it lie many islands; that in all parts of the country there\r\nwere harbours sufficiently commodious to provide anchorage for his\r\nfleet, and that it supplied sites for founding cities, which would\r\nbecome flourishing. He was also informed that there were two islands\r\nin the sea facing the mouth of the Euphrates, the first of which was\r\nnot far from the place where the waters of that river are discharged\r\ninto the sea, being about 120 stades[940] distant from the shore and\r\nthe river’s mouth. This is the smaller of the two, and was densely\r\ncovered with every kind of timber. In it was also a temple of Artemis,\r\naround which the inhabitants themselves spent their lives. The island\r\nwas devoted to the use of wild goats and stags, which were allowed\r\nto range at large as being dedicated to Artemis. It was unlawful to\r\nchase them unless any one wished to offer sacrifice to the goddess;\r\nand for this purpose alone it was lawful to chase them. Aristobulus\r\nsays that Alexander ordered this island to be called Icarus, after the\r\nisland so named in the Aegean Sea,[941] on which, as the report goes,\r\nIcarus, son of Daedalus fell, when the wax, by which the wings had been\r\nfastened to him, melted. For he did not fly near the earth, according\r\nto his father’s injunctions, but senselessly flying far aloft, he\r\nallowed the sun to soften and loosen the wax. Icarus left his name to\r\nthe island and the sea, the former being called Icarus and the latter\r\nthe Icarian. The other island was said to be distant from the mouth\r\nof the Euphrates about a day and night’s voyage for a ship running\r\nbefore the breeze. Its name was Tylus[942]; it was large and most of\r\nit neither rugged nor woody, but suitable for producing cultivated\r\nfruits and all things in due season. Some of this information was\r\nimparted to Alexander by Archias, who was sent with a triacontor to\r\ninvestigate the course of the coasting voyage to Arabia, and who went\r\nas far as the island of Tylus, but durst not pass beyond that point.\r\nAndrosthenes[943] was despatched with another triacontor and sailed\r\nto a part of the peninsula of Arabia. Hieron of Soli the pilot also\r\nreceived a triacontor from Alexander and advanced farthest of those\r\nwhom he despatched to this region; for he had received instructions\r\nto sail round the whole Arabian peninsula as far as the Arabian Gulf\r\nnear Egypt over against Heroöpolis.[944] Although he coasted along\r\nthe country of the Arabs to a great distance, he durst not go as far\r\nas he was ordered; but returning to Alexander he reported that the\r\nsize of the peninsula was marvellous, being only a little smaller than\r\nthe country of the Indians, and its extremity projected far into the\r\nGreat Sea.[945] Nearchus indeed in his voyage from India had seen this\r\nstretching out a little, before he turned aside into the Persian Gulf,\r\nand he was almost induced to cross over to it. The pilot Onesicritus\r\nthought they ought to have gone thither; but Nearchus says that he\r\nhimself prevented it, so that after sailing right round the Persian\r\nGulf he might be able to give a report to Alexander that he had\r\naccomplished the voyage on which he had sent him. For Nearchus said he\r\nhad not been despatched to navigate the Great Sea, but to explore the\r\nland bordering on the sea, to find out what men inhabit it, to discover\r\nthe harbours and rivers in it, to ascertain the customs of the people,\r\nand to see if any of the country was fertile and if any was sterile.\r\nThis was the reason why Alexander’s naval expedition returned in\r\nsafety; for if it had sailed beyond the deserts of Arabia, it would not\r\nhave returned in safety. This is said also to have been the reason why\r\nHieron turned back.[946]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EUPHRATES AND THE PALLACOPAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the triremes were being built for him, and the harbour near\r\nBabylon was being excavated, Alexander sailed from Babylon down the\r\nEuphrates to what was called the river Pallacopas, which is distant\r\nfrom Babylon about 800 stades.[947] This Pallacopas is not a river\r\nrising from springs, but a canal cut from the Euphrates. For that river\r\nflowing from the Armenian mountains,[948] proceeds within its banks in\r\nthe season of winter, because its water is scanty; but when the spring\r\nbegins to make its appearance, and especially just before the summer\r\nsolstice, it pours along with mighty stream and overflows its banks\r\ninto the Assyrian country.[949] For at that season the snow upon the\r\nArmenian mountains melts and swells its water to a great degree; and\r\nas its stream flows high above the level of the country, it would flow\r\nover the land if some one had not furnished it with an outlet along\r\nthe Pallacopas and turned it aside into the marshes and pools, which,\r\nbeginning from this canal, extend as far as the country contiguous\r\nto Arabia. Thence it spreads out far and wide into a shallow lake,\r\nfrom which it falls into the sea by many invisible mouths. After the\r\nsnow has melted, about the time of the setting of the Pleiades, the\r\nEuphrates flows with a small stream; but none the less the greater part\r\nof it discharges itself into the pools along the Pallacopas. Unless,\r\ntherefore, some one had dammed up the Pallacopas again, so that the\r\nwater might be turned back within the banks and carried down the\r\nchannel of the river, it would have drained the Euphrates into itself,\r\nand consequently the Assyrian country would not be watered by it. But\r\nthe outlet of the Euphrates into the Pallacopas was dammed up by the\r\nviceroy of Babylonia with great labour (although it was an easy matter\r\nto construct the outlet), because the ground in this region is slimy\r\nand most of it mud, so that when it has once received the water of the\r\nriver it is not easy to turn it back. But more than 10,000 Assyrians\r\nwere engaged in this labour even until the third month. When Alexander\r\nwas informed of this, he was induced to confer a benefit upon the land\r\nof Assyria. He determined to shut up the outlet where the stream of\r\nthe Euphrates was turned into the Pallacopas. When he had advanced\r\nabout thirty stades, the earth appeared to be somewhat rocky, so that\r\nif it were cut through and a junction made with the old canal along\r\nthe Pallacopas, on account of the hardness of the soil, it would not\r\nallow the water to percolate, and there would be no difficulty in\r\nturning it back at the appointed season. For this purpose he sailed\r\nto the Pallacopas, and then continued his voyage down that canal into\r\nthe pools towards the country of the Arabs. There seeing a certain\r\nadmirable site, he founded a city upon it and fortified it. In it he\r\nsettled as many of the Grecian mercenaries as volunteered to remain,\r\nand such as were unfit for military service by reason of age or wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nAN OMEN OF ALEXANDER’S APPROACHING DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus proved the falsity of the prophecy of the Chaldaeans, by\r\nnot having experienced any unpleasant fortune in Babylon,[950] as they\r\nhad predicted, but having marched out of that city without suffering\r\nany mishap, he grew confident in spirit and sailed again through the\r\nmarshes, having Babylon on his left hand. Here a part of his fleet lost\r\nits way in the narrow branches of the river through want of a pilot,\r\nuntil he sent a man to pilot it and lead it back into the channel\r\nof the river. The following story is told. Most of the tombs of the\r\nAssyrian kings had been built among the pools and marshes.[951] When\r\nAlexander was sailing through these marshes, and, as the story goes,\r\nwas himself steering the trireme, a strong gust of wind fell upon his\r\nbroad-brimmed Macedonian hat, and the fillet which encircled it. The\r\nhat, being heavy, fell into the water; but the fillet, being carried\r\nalong by the wind, was caught by one of the reeds growing near the\r\ntomb of one of the ancient kings.[952] This incident itself was an\r\nomen of what was about to occur, and so was the fact that one of the\r\nsailors[953] swam off towards the fillet and snatched it from the reed.\r\nBut he did not carry it in his hands, because it would have been wetted\r\nwhile he was swimming; he therefore put it round his own head and thus\r\nconveyed it to the king. Most of the biographers of Alexander say\r\nthat the king presented him with a talent as a reward for his zeal,\r\nand then ordered his head to be cut off; as the prophets had directed\r\nhim not to permit that head to be safe which had worn the royal\r\nfillet. However, Aristobulus says that the man received a talent; but\r\nafterwards also received a scourging for placing the fillet round his\r\nhead. The same author says that it was one of the Phoenician sailors\r\nwho fetched the fillet for Alexander; but there are some who say it\r\nwas Seleucus, and that this was an omen to Alexander of his death and\r\nto Seleucus of his great kingdom. For that of all those who succeeded\r\nto the sovereignty after Alexander, Seleucus became the greatest king,\r\nwas the most kingly in mind, and ruled over the greatest extent of land\r\nafter Alexander himself, does not seem to me to admit of question.[954]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY RECRUITED FROM THE PERSIANS.—HEPHAESTION’S MEMORY HONOURED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Babylon he found that Peucestas had arrived from\r\nPersis, bringing with him 20,000 Persians, as well as many Cossaeans\r\nand Tapurians, because these races were reported to be the most warlike\r\nof those bordering on Persis. Philoxenus also came to him, bringing an\r\narmy from Caria; Menander, with another from Lydia, and Menidas with\r\nthe cavalry which had been put under his command.[955] At the same\r\ntime arrived embassies from Greece, the members of which, with crowns\r\nupon their own heads, approached Alexander and crowned him with golden\r\ncrowns, as if forsooth they came to him as special envoys deputed to\r\npay him divine honours; and his end was not far off. Then he commended\r\nthe Persians for their great zeal towards him, which was shown by their\r\nobedience to Peucestas in all things, and Peucestas himself for the\r\nprudence which he had displayed in ruling them. He distributed these\r\nforeign soldiers among the Macedonian ranks in the following way.\r\nEach company was led by a Macedonian decurion, and next to him was a\r\nMacedonian receiving double pay for distinguished valour; and then\r\ncame one who received ten staters,[956] who was so named from the pay\r\nhe received, being less than that received by the man with double pay,\r\nbut more than that of the men who were serving as soldiers without\r\nholding a position of honour. Next to these came twelve Persians, and\r\nlast in the company another Macedonian, who also received the pay of\r\nten staters; so that in each company there were twelve Persians and\r\nfour Macedonians, three of whom received higher pay, and the fourth was\r\nin command of the company.[957] The Macedonians were armed in their\r\nhereditary manner; but of the Persians some were archers, while others\r\nhad javelins furnished with straps, by which they were held.[958] At\r\nthis time Alexander often reviewed his fleet, had many sham-fights with\r\nhis triremes and quadriremes in the river, and contests both for rowers\r\nand pilots, the winners receiving crowns.\r\n\r\nNow arrived the special envoys whom he had despatched to Ammon to\r\ninquire how it was lawful for him to honour Hephaestion. They told him\r\nthat Ammon said it was lawful to offer sacrifice to him as to a hero.\r\nRejoicing at the response of the oracle, he paid respect to him as a\r\nhero from that time. He also despatched a letter to Cleomenes, who was\r\na bad man and had committed many acts of injustice in Egypt.[959] For\r\nmy own part I do not blame him for his friendship to Hephaestion and\r\nfor his recollection of him even when dead; but I do blame him for many\r\nother acts. For the letter commanded Cleomenes to prepare chapels for\r\nthe hero Hephaestion in the Egyptian Alexandria, one in the city itself\r\nand another in the island of Pharos, where the tower is situated.[960]\r\nThe chapels were to be exceedingly large and to be built at lavish\r\nexpense. The letter also directed that Cleomenes should take care\r\nthat Hephaestion’s name should be attached to them; and moreover that\r\nhis name should be engraved on all the legal documents with which the\r\nmerchants entered into bargains with each other.[961] These things I\r\ncannot blame, except that he made so much ado about matters of trifling\r\nmoment. But the following I must blame severely: “If I find,” said the\r\nletter, “the temples and chapels of the hero Hephaestion in Egypt well\r\ncompleted, I will not only pardon you any crimes you may have committed\r\nin the past, but in the future you shall suffer no unpleasant treatment\r\nfrom me, however great may be the crimes you have committed.” I cannot\r\ncommend this message sent from a great king to a man who was ruling\r\na large country and many people, especially as the man was a wicked\r\none.[962]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nANOTHER OMEN OF ALEXANDER’S DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Alexander’s own end was now near. Aristobulus says that the\r\nfollowing occurrence was a prognostication of what was about to happen.\r\nHe was distributing the army which came with Peucestas from Persia,\r\nand that which came with Philoxenus and Menander from the sea,[963]\r\namong the Macedonian lines, and becoming thirsty he retired from his\r\nseat and thus left the royal throne empty. On each side of the throne\r\nwere couches with silver feet, upon which his personal Companions were\r\nsitting. A certain man of obscure condition (some say that he was even\r\none of the men kept under guard without being in chains), seeing the\r\nthrone and the couches empty, and the eunuchs standing round the throne\r\n(for the Companions also rose up from their seats with the king when\r\nhe retired), walked through the line of eunuchs, ascended the throne,\r\nand sat down upon it.[964] According to a Persian law, they did not\r\nmake him rise from the throne; but rent their garments and beat their\r\nbreasts and faces as if on account of a great evil.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander was informed of this, he ordered the man who had sat\r\nupon his throne to be put to the torture, with the view of discovering\r\nwhether he had done this according to a plan concerted by a conspiracy.\r\nBut the man confessed nothing, except that it came into his mind at\r\nthe time to act thus. Even more for this reason the diviners explained\r\nthat this occurrence boded no good to him. A few days after this, after\r\noffering to the gods the customary sacrifices for good success, and\r\ncertain others also for the purpose of divination, he was feasting with\r\nhis friends, and was drinking far into the night.[965] He is also said\r\nto have distributed the sacrificial victims as well as a quantity of\r\nwine to the army throughout the companies and centuries. There are some\r\nwho have recorded that he wished to retire after the drinking party to\r\nhis bed-chamber; but Medius, at that time the most influential of the\r\nCompanions, met him and begged him to join a party of revellers at his\r\nresidence, saying that the revel would be a pleasant one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER SEIZED WITH FEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Diary gives the following account,[966] to the effect that\r\nhe revelled and drank at the dwelling of Medius; then rose up, took a\r\nbath, and slept; then again supped at the house of Medius and again\r\ndrank till far into the night. After retiring from the drinking party\r\nhe took a bath; after which he took a little food and slept there,\r\nbecause he already felt feverish. He was carried out upon a couch to\r\nthe sacrifices, in order that he might offer them according to his\r\ndaily custom. After performing the sacred rites he lay down in the\r\nbanqueting hall until dusk. In the meantime he gave instructions to\r\nthe officers about the expedition and voyage, ordering those who were\r\ngoing on foot to be ready on the fourth day, and those who were going\r\nto sail with him to be ready to sail on the fifth day. From this place\r\nhe was carried upon the couch to the river, where he embarked in a boat\r\nand sailed across the river to the park. There he again took a bath and\r\nwent to rest.\r\n\r\nOn the following day he took another bath and offered the customary\r\nsacrifices. He then entered a tester bed, lay down, and chatted with\r\nMedius. He also ordered his officers to meet him at daybreak. Having\r\ndone this he ate a little supper and was again conveyed into the tester\r\nbed. The fever now raged the whole night without intermission. The next\r\nday he took a bath; after which he offered sacrifice, and gave orders\r\nto Nearchus and the other officers that the voyage should begin on the\r\nthird day. The next day he bathed again and offered the prescribed\r\nsacrifices. After performing the sacred rites, he did not yet cease to\r\nsuffer from the fever. Notwithstanding this, he summoned the officers\r\nand gave them instructions to have all things ready for the starting of\r\nthe fleet. In the evening he took a bath, after which he was very ill.\r\nThe next day he was transferred to the house near the swimming-bath,\r\nwhere he offered the prescribed sacrifices. Though he was now very\r\ndangerously ill, he summoned the most responsible of his officers and\r\ngave them fresh instructions about the voyage. On the following day he\r\nwas with difficulty carried out to the sacrifices, which he offered;\r\nand none the less gave other orders to the officers about the voyage.\r\nThe next day, though he was now very ill, he offered the prescribed\r\nsacrifices. He now gave orders that the generals should remain in\r\nattendance in the hall,[967] and that the colonels and captains should\r\nremain before the gates. But being now altogether in a dangerous state,\r\nhe was conveyed from the park into the palace. When his officers\r\nentered the room, he knew them indeed, but could no longer utter a\r\nword, being speechless. During the ensuing night and day and the next\r\nnight and day he was in a very high fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the account given in the Royal Diary. In addition to this, it\r\nstates that the soldiers were very desirous of seeing him; some, in\r\norder to see him once more while still alive; others, because there was\r\na report that he was already dead, imagined that his death was being\r\nconcealed by the confidential body-guards, as I for my part suppose.\r\nMost of them through grief and affection for their king forced their\r\nway in to see him. It is said that when his soldiers passed by him he\r\nwas unable to speak; yet he greeted each of them with his right hand,\r\nraising his head with difficulty and making a sign with his eyes. The\r\nRoyal Diary also says that Peithon, Attalus, Demophon, and Peucestas,\r\nas well as Cleomenes, Menidas, and Seleucus, slept in the temple of\r\nSerapis,[968] and asked the god whether it would be better and more\r\ndesirable for Alexander to be carried into his temple, in order as\r\na suppliant to be cured by him. A voice issued from the god saying\r\nthat he was not to be carried into the temple, but that it would be\r\nbetter for him to remain where he was. This answer was reported by the\r\nCompanions; and soon after Alexander died, as if forsooth this were now\r\nthe better thing. Neither Aristobulus nor Ptolemy has given an account\r\ndiffering much from the preceding. Some authors, however, have related\r\nthat his Companions asked him to whom he left his kingdom; and that\r\nhe replied: “To the best.”[969] Others say, that in addition to this\r\nremark, he told them that he saw there would be a great funeral contest\r\nheld in his honour.[970]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nRUMOUR THAT ALEXANDER WAS POISONED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am aware that many other particulars have been related by historians\r\nconcerning Alexander’s death, and especially that poison was sent for\r\nhim by Antipater, from the effects of which he died.[971] It is also\r\nasserted that the poison was procured for Antipater by Aristotle, who\r\nwas now afraid of Alexander on account of Callisthenes.[972] It is\r\nsaid to have been conveyed by Cassander, the son of Antipater,[973]\r\nsome recording that he conveyed it in the hoof of a mule, and that\r\nhis younger brother Iollas gave it to the king.[974] For this man was\r\nthe royal cup-bearer, and he happened to have received some affront\r\nfrom Alexander a short time before his death. Others have stated that\r\nMedius, being a lover of Iollas, took part in the deed; for he it was\r\nwho induced the king to hold the revel. They say that Alexander was\r\nseized with an acute paroxysm of pain over the wine-cup, on feeling\r\nwhich he retired from the drinking bout.[975] One writer has not even\r\nbeen ashamed to record that when Alexander perceived he was unlikely to\r\nsurvive, he was going out to throw himself into the river Euphrates, so\r\nthat he might disappear from men’s sight, and leave among the men of\r\nafter-times a more firmly-rooted opinion that he owed his birth to a\r\ngod, and had departed to the gods. But as he was going out he did not\r\nescape the notice of his wife Roxana, who restrained him from carrying\r\nout his design. Whereupon he uttered lamentations, saying that she\r\nforsooth envied him the complete glory of being thought the offspring\r\nof the god. These statements I have recorded rather that I may not seem\r\nto be ignorant that they have been made, than because I consider them\r\nworthy of credence or even of narration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander died in the hundred and fourteenth Olympiad, in the\r\narchonship of Hegesias at Athens.[976] According to the statement of\r\nAristobulus, he lived thirty-two years, and had reached the eighth\r\nmonth of his thirty-third year. He had reigned twelve years and these\r\neight months.[977] He was very handsome in person, and much devoted to\r\nexertion, very active in mind, very heroic in courage, very tenacious\r\nof honour, exceedingly fond of incurring danger, and strictly observant\r\nof his duty to the gods. In regard to the pleasures of the body, he had\r\nperfect self-control; and of those of the mind, praise was the only\r\none of which he was insatiable. He was very clever in recognising what\r\nwas necessary to be done, even when it was still a matter unnoticed\r\nby others; and very successful in conjecturing from the observation\r\nof facts what was likely to occur. In marshalling, arming, and ruling\r\nan army, he was exceedingly skilful; and very renowned for rousing\r\nthe courage of his soldiers, filling them with hopes of success,\r\nand dispelling their fear in the midst of danger by his own freedom\r\nfrom fear. Therefore even what he had to do in secret he did with\r\nthe greatest boldness. He was also very clever in getting the start\r\nof his enemies, and snatching from them their advantages by secretly\r\nforestalling them, before any one even feared what was about to\r\nhappen. He was likewise very steadfast in keeping the agreements and\r\nsettlements which he made, as well as very secure from being entrapped\r\nby deceivers. Finally, he was very sparing in the expenditure of money\r\nfor the gratification of his own pleasures; but he was exceedingly\r\nbountiful in spending it for the benefit of his associates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nAPOLOGY FOR ALEXANDER’S ERRORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Alexander should have committed errors in his conduct from\r\nquickness of temper or from wrath,[978] and that he should have been\r\ninduced to comport himself like the Persian monarchs to an immoderate\r\ndegree, I do not think remarkable if we fairly consider both his\r\nyouth[979] and his uninterrupted career of good fortune; likewise that\r\nkings have no associates in pleasure who aim at their best interests,\r\nbut that they will always have associates urging them to do wrong.\r\nHowever, I am certain that Alexander was the only one of the ancient\r\nkings who, from nobility of character, repented of the errors which he\r\nhad committed. The majority of men, even if they have become conscious\r\nthat they have committed an error, make the mistake of thinking that\r\nthey can conceal their sin by defending their error as if it had been\r\na just action. But it seems to me that the only cure for sin is for\r\nthe sinner to confess it, and to be visibly repentant in regard to it.\r\nThus the suffering will not appear altogether intolerable to those who\r\nhave undergone unpleasant treatment, if the person who inflicted it\r\nconfesses that he has acted dishonourably; and this good hope for the\r\nfuture is left to the man himself, that he will never again commit a\r\nsimilar sin, if he is seen to be vexed at his former errors. I do not\r\nthink that even his tracing his origin to a god was a great error on\r\nAlexander’s part, if it was not perhaps merely a device to induce his\r\nsubjects to show him reverence.[980] Nor does he seem to me to have\r\nbeen a less renowned king than Minos, Aeacus, or Rhadamanthus, to whom\r\nno insolence is attributed by the men of old, because they traced their\r\norigin to Zeus. Nor does he seem at all inferior to Theseus or Ion, the\r\nformer being the reputed son of Poseidon, and the latter of Apollo. His\r\nadoption of the Persian mode of dressing also seems to me to have been\r\na political device in regard to the foreigners, that the king might not\r\nappear altogether an alien to them; and in regard to the Macedonians,\r\nto show them that he had a refuge from their rashness of temper and\r\ninsolence. For this reason I think, he mixed the Persian royal guards,\r\nwho carried golden apples at the end of their spears,[981] among\r\nthe ranks of the Macedonians, and the Persian peers[982] with the\r\nMacedonian body-guards. Aristobulus also asserts that Alexander used\r\nto have long drinking parties, not for the purpose of enjoying the\r\nwine, as he was not a great wine-drinker, but in order to exhibit his\r\nsociality and friendly feeling to his Companions.[983]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nEULOGY OF ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoever therefore reproaches Alexander as a bad man, let him do so;\r\nbut let him first not only bring before his mind all his actions\r\ndeserving reproach, but also gather into one view all his deeds of\r\nevery kind. Then, indeed, let him reflect who he is himself, and what\r\nkind of fortune he has experienced; and then consider who that man was\r\nwhom he reproaches as bad, and to what a height of human success he\r\nattained, becoming without any dispute king of both continents,[984]\r\nand reaching every place by his fame; while he himself who reproaches\r\nhim is of smaller account, spending his labour on petty objects, which,\r\nhowever, he does not succeed in effecting, petty as they are. For my\r\nown part, I think there was at that time no race of men, no city, nor\r\neven a single individual to whom Alexander’s name and fame had not\r\npenetrated. For this reason it seems to me that a hero totally unlike\r\nany other human being could not have been born without the agency of\r\nthe deity. And this is said to have been revealed after Alexander’s\r\ndeath by the oracular responses, by the visions which presented\r\nthemselves to various people, and by the dreams which were seen by\r\ndifferent individuals. It is also shown by the honour paid to him by\r\nmen up to the present time, and by the recollection which is still held\r\nof him as more than human. Even at the present time, after so long an\r\ninterval, other oracular responses in his honour have been received by\r\nthe nation of the Macedonians. In relating the history of Alexander’s\r\nachievements, there are some things which I have been compelled to\r\ncensure; but I am not ashamed to admire Alexander himself. Those\r\nactions I have branded as bad, both from a regard to my own veracity,\r\nand at the same time for the benefit of mankind.[985] For this reason\r\nI think that I undertook the task of writing this history not without\r\nthe divine inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE HISTORY OF ALEXANDER’S DEEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Cf.

Ptolemy’s mother,\r\nArsinoe, had been a concubine of Philip of Macedon, for which reason\r\nit was generally believed that Ptolemy was the offspring of that\r\nking. Ptolemy was one of the earliest friends of Alexander before his\r\naccession to the throne, and accompanied him throughout his campaigns,\r\nbeing one of his most skilful generals and most intimate friends. On\r\nthe division of the empire after Alexander’s death, Ptolemy obtained\r\nthe kingdom of Egypt, which he transmitted to his descendants. After\r\na distinguished reign of thirty-eight years, he abdicated the throne\r\nto his youngest son, Ptolemy Philadelphus. He survived this event two\r\nyears, and died B.C. 283. He was a liberal patron of literature and the\r\narts, and wrote a history of the wars of Alexander, which is one of\r\nthe chief authorities on which Arrian composed his narrative. For his\r\nbeneficence, see Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xiii. 12). Not only Arrian,\r\nbut Plutarch and Strabo, derived much information from Ptolemy’s work,\r\nwhich is highly commended by Athenæus.\r\n\r\n[12] Aristobulus of Potidaea, a town in Macedonia, which was afterwards\r\ncalled Cassandrea, served under Alexander, and wrote a history of his\r\nwars, which, like that of Ptolemy, was sometimes more panegyrical\r\nthan the facts warranted. Neither of these histories has survived,\r\nbut they served Arrian as the groundwork for the composition of\r\nhis own narrative. Lucian in his treatise, _Quomodo historia sit\r\nconscribenda_, ch. 12, accuses Aristobulus of inventing marvellous\r\ntales of Alexander’s valour for the sake of flattery. Plutarch based\r\nhis _Life of Alexander_ chiefly on the work of this writer. We learn\r\nfrom Lucian (_Macrobioi_, c. 22), that Aristobulus wrote his history\r\nat the advanced age of eighty-four. He was employed by Alexander to\r\nsuperintend the restoration of Cyrus’s tomb (_Arrian_, vi. 30).\r\n\r\n[13] ἀναλέγομαι in the sense of reading through = ἀναγιγνώσκειν, is\r\nfound only in the later writers, Arrian, Plutarch, Dion, Callimachus,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[14] B.C. 336. He was murdered by a young noble named Pausanias,\r\nwho stabbed him at the festival which he was holding to celebrate\r\nthe marriage of his daughter with Alexander, king of Epirus. It was\r\nsuspected that both Olympias and her son Alexander were implicated in\r\nthe plot. At the time of his assassination Philip was just about to\r\nstart on an expedition against Persia, which his son afterwards so\r\nsuccessfully carried out. See Plutarch (_Alex._, 10); _Diod._, xix. 93,\r\n94; Aristotle (_Polit._, v. 8, 10).\r\n\r\n[15] It was the custom of the Athenians to name the years from the\r\npresident of the college of nine archons at Athens, who were elected\r\nannually. The Attic writers adopted this method of determining dates.\r\nSee Smith’s _Dictionary of Antiquities_.\r\n\r\n[16] Alexander the Great was the son of Philip II. and Olympias, and\r\nwas born at Pella B.C. 356. In his youth he was placed under the\r\ntuition of Aristotle, who acquired very great influence over his\r\nmind and character, and retained it until his pupil was spoiled by\r\nhis unparalleled successes. See Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xii. 54).\r\nSuch was his ability, that at the age of 16 he was entrusted with\r\nthe government of Macedonia by his father, when he marched against\r\nByzantium. At the age of 18 by his skill and courage he greatly\r\nassisted Philip in gaining the battle of Chaeronea. When Philip was\r\nmurdered, Alexander ascended the throne, and after putting down\r\nrebellion at home, he advanced into Greece to secure the power which\r\nhis father had acquired. See _Diod._, xvi. 85; _Arrian_, vii. 9.\r\n\r\n[17] See _Justin_, xi. 2.\r\n\r\n[18] “Arrian speaks as if this request had been addressed only to the\r\nGreeks _within_ Peloponnesus; moreover he mentions no assembly at\r\nCorinth, which is noticed, though with some confusion, by Diodorus,\r\nJustin, and Plutarch. Cities out of Peloponnesus, as well as within\r\nit, must have been included; unless we suppose that the resolution\r\nof the Amphictyonic assembly, which had been previously passed, was\r\nheld to comprehend all the extra-Peloponnesian cities, which seems not\r\nprobable.”—_Grote._\r\n\r\n[19] Justin (ix. 5) says: “Soli Lacedaemonii et legem et regem\r\ncontempserunt.” The king here referred to was Philip.\r\n\r\n[20] See _Justin_, xi. 3; Aeschines, _Contra Ctesiphontem_, p. 564.\r\n\r\n[21] The Triballians were a tribe inhabiting the part of Servia\r\nbordering on Bulgaria. The Illyrians inhabited the eastern coast of the\r\nAdriatic Sea, the districts now called North Albania, Bosnia, Dalmatia\r\nand Croatia.\r\n\r\n[22] We learn from _Thucydides_, ii. 96, that these people were called\r\nDii.\r\n\r\n[23] The Nessus, or Nestus, is now called Mesto by the Greeks, and\r\nKarasu by the Turks.\r\n\r\n[24] Now known as the Balkan. The defiles mentioned by Arrian are\r\nprobably what was afterwards called Porta Trajani. Cf. Vergil\r\n(_Georg._, ii. 488); Horace (_Carm._, i. 12, 6).\r\n\r\n[25] πεποίηντο:—Arrian often forms the pluperfect tense without the\r\naugment. διασκεδάσουσι:—The Attic future of this verb is διασκεδῶ. Cf.\r\nAristoph. (_Birds_, 1053).\r\n\r\n[26] The Agrianes were a tribe of Eastern Paeonia who lived near the\r\nTriballians. They served in the Macedonian army chiefly as cavalry and\r\nlight infantry.\r\n\r\n[27] Perhaps Neapolis and Eion, which were the harbours of Philippi and\r\nAmphipolis.\r\n\r\n[28] This officer was commander of the royal body-guard. His father was\r\nParmenio, the most experienced of Alexander’s generals.\r\n\r\n[29] Thucydides says (Bk. ii. 96): “On the side of the Triballians,\r\nwho were also independent, the border tribes were the Trerians and the\r\nTilatæans, who live to the north of mount Scombrus, and stretch towards\r\nthe west as far as the river Oscius. This river flows from the same\r\nmountains as the Nestus and the Hebrus, an uninhabited and extensive\r\nrange, joining on to Rhodope.” The Oscius is now called Isker. It is\r\nuncertain which river is the Lyginus; but perhaps it was another name\r\nfor the Oscius.\r\n\r\n[30] Also named _Danube_. Cf. Hesiod (_Theog._, 339); Ovid (_Met._, ii.\r\n249); Pindar (_Olym._ iii. 24).\r\n\r\n[31] It is uncertain in what part of the Danube this island was. It\r\ncannot be the Peuce of Strabo (vii, 3). Cf. _Apollonius Rhodius_ (iv.\r\n309); _Martialis_ (vii. 84); _Valerius Flaccus_ (viii. 217).\r\n\r\n[32] These two generals are mentioned (iii. 11 infra) as being present\r\nat the battle of Arbela. Sopolis is also mentioned (iv. 13 and 18\r\ninfra).\r\n\r\n[33] Bottiaea was a district of Macedonia on the right bank of the\r\nAxius.\r\n\r\n[34] The classical writers have three names to denote this\r\nrace:—Celts, Galatians, and Gauls. These names were originally given\r\nto all the people of the North and West of Europe; and it was not till\r\nCæsar’s time that the Romans made any distinction between Celts and\r\nGermans. The name of Celts was then confined to the people north of the\r\nPyrenees and west of the Rhine. Cf. _Ammianus_ (xv. 9); _Herodotus_\r\n(iv. 49); _Livy_ (v. 33, 34); _Polybius_ (iii. 39).\r\n\r\n[35] Arrian is here speaking, not of Alexander’s time, but of his own,\r\nthe second century of the Christian era. The Quadi were a race dwelling\r\nin the south-east of Germany. They are generally mentioned with the\r\nMarcomanni, and were formidable enemies of the Romans, especially in\r\nthe reign of Marcus Aurelius, when Arrian wrote. This nation disappears\r\nfrom history about the end of the fourth century.\r\n\r\n[36] The Marcomanni, like the Quadi, were a powerful branch of the\r\nSuevic race, originally dwelling in the south-west of Germany; but\r\nin the reign of Tiberius they dispossessed the Boii of the country\r\nnow called Bohemia. In conjunction with the Quadi, they were very\r\nformidable to the Romans until Commodus purchased peace from them. The\r\nname denotes “border men.” Cf. Cæsar (_Bel. Gal._, i. 51).\r\n\r\n[37] The Iazygians were a tribe of Sarmatians, who migrated from the\r\ncoast of the Black Sea, between the Dnieper and the Sea of Azov, in the\r\nreign of Claudius, and settled in Dacia, near the Quadi, with whom they\r\nformed a close alliance. They were conquered by the Goths in the fifth\r\ncentury. Cf. Ovid (_Tristia_, ii. 191).\r\n\r\n[38] Called also Sarmatians. Herodotus (iv. 21) says that these people\r\nlived east of the Don, and were allied to the Scythians. Subsequent\r\nwriters understood by Sarmatia the east part of Poland, the south of\r\nRussia, and the country southward as far as the Danube.\r\n\r\n[39] These people were called Dacians by the Romans. They were\r\nThracians, and are said by Herodotus and Thucydides to have lived south\r\nof the Danube, near its mouths. They subsequently migrated north of\r\nthis river, and were driven further west by the Sarmatians. They were\r\nvery formidable to the Romans in the reigns of Augustus and Domitian.\r\nDacia was conquered by Trajan; but ultimately abandoned by Aurelian,\r\nwho made the Danube the boundary of the Roman Empire. About the Getae\r\nholding the doctrine of immortality, see _Herodotus_ (iv. 94). Cf.\r\nHorace (_Carm._, iii. 6, 13; _Sat._, ii. 6, 53).\r\n\r\n[40] The Scythians are said by Herodotus to have inhabited the south of\r\nRussia. His supposition that they came from Asia is doubtless correct.\r\nHe gives ample information about this race in the fourth book of his\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\n[41] Herodotus (iv. 47) says the Danube had five mouths; but Strabo\r\n(vii. 3) says there were seven. At the present time it has only three\r\nmouths. The Greeks called the Black Sea πόντος εὔξεινος,\r\n_the sea kind to strangers_. Cf. Ovid (_Tristia_, iv. 4,\r\n55):—“Frigida me cohibent Euxini litora Ponti, Dictus ab antiquis\r\nAxenus ille fuit.”\r\n\r\n[42] The _sarissa_, or more correctly _sarisa_, was a spear peculiar to\r\nthe Macedonians. It was from fourteen to sixteen feet long. See Grote’s\r\n_Greece_, vol. xi. ch. 92, Appendix.\r\n\r\n[43] Son of Parmenio and brother of Philotas.\r\n\r\n[44] The parasang was a Persian measure, containing thirty stades,\r\nnearly three and three-quarter English miles. It is still used by the\r\nPersians, who call it _ferseng_. See _Herodotus_ (vi. 42) and Grote’s\r\n_History of Greece_, vol. viii. p. 316.\r\n\r\n[45] Son of Neoptolemus. After Alexander’s death Meleager resisted the\r\nclaim of Perdiccas to the regency, and was associated with him in the\r\noffice. He was, however, soon afterwards put to death by the order of\r\nhis rival.\r\n\r\n[46] Son of Machatas, was an eminent general, slain in India. See vi.\r\n27 infra.\r\n\r\n[47] The Macedonian kings believed they were sprung from Hercules. See\r\n_Curtius_, iv. 7.\r\n\r\n[48] The Adriatic Sea.\r\n\r\n[49] Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xii. 23); _Strabo_, vii. p. 293;\r\nAristotle (_Nicom. Ethics_, iii. 7; _Eudem. Eth._, iii. 1):—οἷον οἱ\r\nΚελτοὶ πρὸς τὰ κύματα ὅπλα ἀπαντῶσι λαβόντες; _Ammianus_, xv. 12.\r\n\r\n[50] The Paeonians were a powerful Thracian people, who in early times\r\nspread over a great part of Thrace and Macedonia. In historical times\r\nthey inhabited the country on the northern border of Macedonia. They\r\nwere long troublesome to Macedonia, but were subdued by Philip the\r\nfather of Alexander, who, however, allowed them to retain their own\r\nchiefs. The Agrianians were the chief tribe of Paeonians, from whom\r\nPhilip and Alexander formed a valuable body of light-armed troops.\r\n\r\n[51] Bardylis was a chieftain of Illyria who carried on frequent wars\r\nwith the Macedonians, but was at last defeated and slain by Philip,\r\nB.C. 359. Clitus had been subdued by Philip in 349 B.C.\r\n\r\n[52] This Glaucias subsequently afforded asylum to the celebrated\r\nPyrrhus, King of Epirus, when an infant of two years of age. He took\r\nthe child into his own family and brought him up with his own children.\r\nHe not only refused to surrender Pyrrhus to Cassander, but marched into\r\nEpirus and placed the boy, when twelve years of age, upon the throne,\r\nleaving him under the care of guardians, B.C. 307.\r\n\r\n[53] The Taulantians were a people of Illyria in the neighbourhood of\r\nEpidamnus, now called Durazzo.\r\n\r\n[54] These were an Illyrian people in the Dalmatian mountains.\r\n\r\n[55] Cyna was the daughter of Philip, by Audata, an Illyrian woman. See\r\n_Athenæus_, p. 557 D. She was given in marriage to her cousin Amyntas,\r\nwho had a preferable claim to the Macedonian throne as the son of\r\nPhilip’s elder brother, Perdiccas. This Amyntas was put to death by\r\nAlexander soon after his accession. Cyna was put to death by Alcetas,\r\nat the order of Perdiccas, the regent after Alexander’s death. See\r\n_Diodorus_, xix. 52.\r\n\r\n[56] The capital of Macedonia. On its site stands the modern village of\r\nNeokhori, or Yenikiuy. Philip and Alexander were born here.\r\n\r\n[57] A tributary of the Axius, called Agrianus by Herodotus. It is now\r\ncalled Tscherna.\r\n\r\n[58] This city was situated south of lake Lychnitis, on the west side\r\nof the chain of Scardus and Pindus. The locality is described in\r\n_Livy_, xxxi. 39, 40.\r\n\r\n[59] Now called Devol.\r\n\r\n[60] The use of καίτοι with a participle instead of the Attic καίπερ is\r\nfrequent in Arrian and the later writers.\r\n\r\n[61] The Hypaspists—shield-bearers, or guards—were a body of infantry\r\norganized by Philip, originally few in number, and employed as personal\r\ndefenders of the king, but afterwards enlarged into several distinct\r\nbrigades. They were hoplites intended for close combat, but more\r\nlightly armed and more fit for rapid evolutions than the phalanx. Like\r\nthe Greeks, they fought with the one-handed pike and shield. They\r\noccupied an intermediate position between the heavy infantry of the\r\nphalanx, and the peltasts and other light troops. See Grote’s _Greece_,\r\nvol. xi. ch. 92.\r\n\r\n[62] The heavy cavalry, wholly or chiefly composed of Macedonians by\r\nbirth, was known by the honourable name of ἑταίροι,\r\nCompanions, or Brothers in Arms. It was divided, as it seems, into 15\r\nἴλαι, which were named after the States or districts from\r\nwhich they came. Their strength varied from 150 to 250 men. A separate\r\none, the 16th Ilē formed the so-called _agema_, or royal horse-guard,\r\nat the head of which Alexander himself generally charged. See _Arrian_,\r\niii. 11, 13, 18.\r\n\r\n[63] In addition to his other military improvements, Philip had\r\norganized an effective siege-train with projectile and battering\r\nengines superior to anything of the kind existing before. This\r\nartillery was at once made use of by Alexander in this campaign against\r\nthe Illyrians.\r\n\r\n[64] Perdiccas, son of Orontes, a Macedonian, was one of Alexander’s\r\nmost distinguished generals. The king is said on his death-bed to\r\nhave taken the royal signet from his finger and to have given it to\r\nPerdiccas. After Alexander’s death he was appointed regent; but an\r\nalliance was formed against him by Antipater, Craterus, and Ptolemy. He\r\nmarched into Egypt against Ptolemy. Being defeated in his attempts to\r\nforce the passage of the Nile, his own troops mutinied against him and\r\nslew him (B.C. 321). See _Diodorus_, xviii. 36. For his personal valour\r\nsee Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xii. 39).\r\n\r\n[65] Coenus, son of Polemocrates, was a son-in-law of Parmenio, and one\r\nof Alexander’s best generals. He violently accused his brother-in-law\r\nPhilotas of treason, and personally superintended the torturing of that\r\nfamous officer previous to his execution (_Curtius_, vi. 36, 42). He\r\nwas put forward by the army to dissuade Alexander from advancing beyond\r\nthe Hyphasis (_Arrian_, v. 27). Soon after this he died and was buried\r\nwith all possible magnificence near that river, B.C. 327 (_Arrian_, vi.\r\n2).\r\n\r\n[66] The Cadmea was the Acropolis of Thebes, an oval eminence of no\r\ngreat height, named after Cadmus, the leader of a Phoenician colony,\r\nwho is said to have founded it. Since the battle of Chaeronea, this\r\ncitadel had been held by a Macedonian garrison.\r\n\r\n[67] Amyntas was a Macedonian officer, and Timolaüs a leading Theban of\r\nthe Macedonian faction.\r\n\r\n[68] Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xii. 57).\r\n\r\n[69] These were two provinces in the west of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n[70] Two divisions of Epirus.\r\n\r\n[71] A town on the Penēus in Hestiaeotis.\r\n\r\n[72] A town in Boeotia, on the lake Copais, distant 50 stades\r\nnorth-west of Thebes.\r\n\r\n[73] It seems from Plutarch, that Alexander was really wounded in the\r\nhead by a stone, in a battle with the Illyrians.\r\n\r\n[74] This Alexander was also called Lyncestes, from being a native of\r\nLyncestis, a district of Macedonia. He was an accomplice in Philip’s\r\nmurder, but was pardoned by his successor. He accompanied Alexander the\r\nGreat into Asia, but was put to death in B.C. 330, for having carried\r\non a treasonable correspondence with Darius. See _Arrian_, i. 25.\r\n\r\n[75] The friend and charioteer of Hercules.\r\n\r\n[76] He sent to demand the surrender of the anti-Macedonian leaders,\r\nPhoenix and Prothytes, but offering any other Thebans who came out to\r\nhim the terms agreed upon in the preceding year. See Plutarch (_Life of\r\nAlexander_, 11); and _Diodorus_, xvii. 9.\r\n\r\n[77] The Boeotarchs were the chief magistrates of the Boeotian\r\nconfederacy, chosen annually by the different States. The number\r\nvaried from ten to twelve. At the time of the battle of Delium, in\r\nthe Peloponnesian war, they were eleven in number, two of them being\r\nThebans. See Grote, _History of Greece_, vol. ii. p. 296.\r\n\r\n[78] Arrian says that the attack of the Macedonians upon Thebes\r\nwas made by Perdiccas, without orders from Alexander; and that the\r\ncapture was effected in a short time and with no labour on the part\r\nof the captors (ch. ix.). But Diodorus says that Alexander ordered\r\nand arranged the assault, that the Thebans made a brave and desperate\r\nresistance for a long time, and that not only the Boeotian allies, but\r\nthe Macedonians themselves committed great slaughter of the besieged\r\n(_Diod._ xvii. 11-14). It is probable that Ptolemy, who was Arrian’s\r\nauthority, wished to exonerate Alexander from the guilt of destroying\r\nThebes.\r\n\r\n[79] Amyntas was one of Alexander’s leading officers. He and his\r\nbrothers were accused of being accomplices in the plot of Philotas, but\r\nwere acquitted. He was however soon afterwards killed in a skirmish\r\n(_Arrian_, iii. 27).\r\n\r\n[80] The mythical founder of the walls of Thebes. See _Pausanias_ (ix.\r\n17).\r\n\r\n[81] The Thebans had incurred the enmity of the other Boeotians by\r\ntreating them as subjects instead of allies. They had destroyed the\r\nrestored Plataea, and had been the chief enemies of the Phocians in the\r\nSacred War, which ended in the subjugation of that people by Philip.\r\nSee Smith’s _History of Greece_, pp. 467, 473, 506.\r\n\r\n[82] More than 500 Macedonians were killed, while 6,000 Thebans were\r\nslain, and 30,000 sold into slavery. See Aelian (_Varia Historia_,\r\nxiii. 7); _Diodorus_ (xvii. 14); _Pausanias_ (viii. 30); Plutarch\r\n(_Life of Alexander_, 11). The sale of the captives realized 440\r\ntalents, or about £107,000; and Justin (xi. 4) says that large sums\r\nwere offered from feelings of hostility towards Thebes on the part of\r\nthe bidders.\r\n\r\n[83] B.C. 415-413. See Grote’s _Greece_, vol. vii.\r\n\r\n[84] B.C. 405. See _Thucydides_ (ii. 13); Xenophon (_Hellenics_, ii. 2).\r\n\r\n[85] By Conon’s victory at Cnidus, B.C. 394.\r\n\r\n[86] At Leuctra they lost 400 Spartans and 1,000 other Lacedaemonians.\r\nSee Xen. (_Hellen._, vi. 4).\r\n\r\n[87] The Achaeans, Eleans, Athenians, and some of the Arcadians, were\r\nallies of Sparta at this crisis, B.C. 369. See Xen.

See _Thuc._, v. 32, 84, etc.\r\n\r\n[90] These persons must have forgotten that Alexander’s predecessor and\r\nnamesake had served in the army of Xerxes along with the Thebans. See\r\n_Herodotus_ vii. 173.\r\n\r\n[91] Plutarch (_Lysander_, 15) says that the Theban Erianthus moved\r\nthat Athens should be destroyed.\r\n\r\n[92] See Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xii. 57).\r\n\r\n[93] Plutarch (_Alexander_, 13) tells us that Alexander was afterwards\r\nsorry for his cruelty to the Thebans. He believed that he had incurred\r\nthe wrath of Dionysus, the tutelary deity of Thebes, who incited him to\r\nkill his friend Clitus, and induced his soldiers to refuse to follow\r\nhim into the interior of India.\r\n\r\n[94] Orchomenus was destroyed by the Thebans B.C. 364. See _Diod._, xv.\r\n79; Demosthenes (_Contra Leptinem_, p. 489). It was restored by Philip,\r\naccording to _Pausanias_, iv. 27.\r\n\r\n[95] The Great Mysteries of Demeter were celebrated at Eleusis, from\r\nthe 15th to the 23rd of the month Boedromion, our September.\r\n\r\n[96] All these nine men were orators except Chares, Charidemus, and\r\nEphialtes, who were military men. Plutarch (_Life of Demosthenes_, 23)\r\ndoes not mention Chares, Diotimus, and Hyperides, but puts the names of\r\nCallisthenes and Damon in the list.\r\n\r\n[97] See Aeschines (_Adversus Ctesiphontem_, pp. 469, 547, 551, 603,\r\n633); Plutarch (_Demosthenes_, 22; _Phocion_, 16); _Diodorus_, xvii. 5.\r\n\r\n[98] At the head of this embassy was Phocion.\r\n\r\n[99] He was put to death by Darius shortly before the battle of Issus,\r\nfor advising him not to rely on his Asiatic troops in the contest\r\nwith Alexander, but to subsidize an army of Grecian mercenaries. See\r\n_Curtius_, iii. 5; _Diodorus_, xvii. 30.\r\n\r\n[100] Archelaüs was king of Macedonia from B.C. 413-399. He improved\r\nthe internal arrangements of his kingdom, and patronised art and\r\nliterature. He induced the tragic poets, Euripides and Agathon, as\r\nwell as the epic poet Choerilus, to visit him; and treated Euripides\r\nespecially with favour. He also invited Socrates, who declined the\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n[101] Aegae, or Edessa, was the earlier capital of Macedonia, and the\r\nburial place of its kings. Philip was murdered here, B.C. 336.\r\n\r\n[102] A narrow strip of land in Macedonia, between the mouths of the\r\nHaliacmon and Penēus, the reputed home of Orpheus and the Muses.\r\n\r\n[103] Cf. _Apollonius Rhodius_, iv. 1284; _Livy_, xxii. i.\r\n\r\n[104] This man was the most noted soothsayer of his time. Telmissus\r\nwas a city of Caria, celebrated for the skill of its inhabitants in\r\ndivination. Cf. Arrian (_Anab._ i. 25, ii. 18, iii. 2, iii. 7, iii. 15,\r\niv. 4, iv. 15); _Herodotus_, i. 78; and Cicero (_De Divinatione_, i.\r\n41).\r\n\r\n[105] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 17) says that there were 30,000 infantry and\r\n4,500 cavalry. He gives the numbers in the different brigades as well\r\nas the names of the commanders. Plutarch (_Life of Alexander_, 15)\r\nsays that the lowest numbers recorded were 30,000 infantry and 5,000\r\ncavalry; and the highest, 34,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry.\r\n\r\n[106] This lake is near the mouth of the Strymon. It is called Prasias\r\nby _Herodotus_ (v. 16). Its present name is Tak-hyno.\r\n\r\n[107] This mountain is now called Pirnari. Xerxes took the same route\r\nwhen marching into Greece.

It is now called Polina.\r\n\r\n[119] We find from _Diodorus_ (xvii. 7), that the Persian king had\r\nsubsidized this great general and 5,000 Greek mercenaries to protect\r\nhis seaboard from the Macedonians. Before the arrival of Alexander, he\r\nhad succeeded in checking the advance of Parmenio and Callas. If Memnon\r\nhad lived and his advice been adopted by Darius, the fate of Persia\r\nmight have been very different. Cf. Plutarch (_Life of Alex._, 18).\r\n\r\n[120] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 18) says that Memnon, while advising the\r\nPersian generals to lay waste the country, and to prevent the\r\nMacedonians from advancing through scarcity of provisions, also urged\r\nthem to carry a large force into Greece and Macedonia, and thus\r\ntransfer the war into Europe.\r\n\r\n[121] The Granicus rises in Mount Ida, and falls into the Propontis\r\nnear Cyzicus. Ovid (_Metam._, xi. 763) calls it _Granicus bicornis_.\r\n\r\n[122] This was a brigade of about 1,000 men. See _Livy_, xxxvii. 42.\r\n\r\n[123] ὑποφθάσομεν. This future is used by the later writers for the\r\nAttic ὑποφθήσομαι. It is found however in Xenophon.\r\n\r\n[124] Craterus was one of Alexander’s best generals. On the death\r\nof the king he received the government of Macedonia and Greece in\r\nconjunction with Antipater, whose daughter he married. He fell in\r\nbattle against Eumenes (B.C. 321).\r\n\r\n[125] Calas was appointed viceroy of Phrygia. He consequently took no\r\nfurther part in Alexander’s campaigns after this.\r\n\r\n[126] Alexander had three generals named Philip, two of whom are\r\nmentioned here as sons of Amyntas and Menelaüs. The third was son of\r\nMachatas, and was left in India as viceroy.\r\n\r\n[127] Son of Tyrimmas, was commander of the Odrysian cavalry. See iii.\r\n12 infra.\r\n\r\n[128] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 19) says that the Persian cavalry numbered\r\n10,000, and their infantry 100,000. Both these numbers are inaccurate.\r\nWe know from _Arrian_ (chaps. 12 and 13) that the Persian infantry was\r\ninferior in number to that of Alexander.\r\n\r\n[129] This is an Homeric name for Mars the war-god. In _Homer_ Ares is\r\nthe Trojan and Enyalius the Grecian war-god. Hence they are mentioned\r\nas different in Aristophanes (_Pax_, 457). See Paley’s note on _Homer_\r\n(vii. 166). As to the practice of shouting the war-cry to Mars before\r\nbattle, see Xenophon (_Anab._, i. 8, 18; v. 2, 14). The Scholiast on\r\n_Thucydides_ (i. 50) says that the Greeks used to sing two paeans, one\r\nto Mars before battle, another to Apollo after it.\r\n\r\n[130] ὡς ἀνυστόν = ὡς δυνατόν. Cf. _Arrian_, iv. 12, 6; Xenophon\r\n(_Anab._, i. 8, 11; _Res. Laced._, i. 3).\r\n\r\n[131] ξυνειστήκει μάχη. This is a common expression with Arrian, copied\r\nfrom _Herodotus_ (i. 74, _et passim_).\r\n\r\n[132] Plutarch (_Alex._, 16); _Diodorus_ (xvii. 20).\r\n\r\n[133] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 21) says that more than 10,000 of the Persian\r\ninfantry were killed, and 2,000 cavalry; and that more than 20,000 were\r\nmade prisoners.\r\n\r\n[134] Her name was Statira.\r\n\r\n[135] An important city in Macedonia on the Thermaic gulf, named after\r\na temple of Zeus.\r\n\r\n[136] Lysippus of Sicyon was one of the most famous of Greek\r\nstatuaries. None of his works remain, inasmuch as they were all\r\nexecuted in bronze. Alexander published an edict that no one should\r\npaint his portrait but Apelles, and that no one should make a statue of\r\nhim but Lysippus. When Metellus conquered Macedonia, he removed this\r\ngroup of bronze statues to Rome, to decorate his own portico. See Pliny\r\n(_Nat. Hist._, xxxiv. 19); _Velleius Paterculus_ (i. 11).\r\n\r\n[137] As most of the infantry on the Persian side were Grecian\r\nmercenaries, who, according to _Plutarch_, fought with desperate\r\nvalour, and, according to _Arrian_ himself, all the infantry were\r\nkilled except 2,000, the number of Alexander’s slain must have been\r\nlarger than Arrian here states.\r\n\r\n[138] At Corinth, B.C. 336.\r\n\r\n[139] For the fact that the Acropolis of Athens was often called simply\r\n_polis_, see _Thucydides_, ii. 15; Xenophon (_Anab._ vii. 1, 27);\r\n_Antiphon_ (146, 2); Aristophanes (_Equites_, 1093; _Lysistrata_, 758).\r\n\r\n[140] A city at the foot of Mount Ida.\r\n\r\n[141] A city of Bithynia, on the Propontis.\r\n\r\n[142] About eight miles.\r\n\r\n[143] This river flows through Phrygia and Lydia, and falls into the\r\ngulf of Smyrna. Its present name is Kodus-Çhai. See Vergil (_Georg._,\r\nii. 137); _Silius_, i. 159; Claudian (_Raptus Proserpinae_, ii. 67).\r\n\r\n[144] Nearly two-and-a-half miles.\r\n\r\n[145] For a description of this fortress, see _Herodotus_, i. 84.\r\n\r\n[146] Memnon had succeeded his brother Mentor as governor for the\r\nPersian king of the territory near the Hellespont. See _Diodorus_,\r\nxvii. 7.\r\n\r\n[147] This man took refuge with Darius, and distinguished himself at\r\nthe battle of Issus. See Plutarch (_Alex._, 20); _Curtius_, iii. 28.\r\nHe met with his death soon after in Egypt. See _Arrian_, ii. 6 and 13;\r\n_Diod._, xvii. 48.\r\n\r\n[148] The temple of Artemis at Ephesus had been burnt down by\r\nHerostratus in the night on which Alexander was born (Oct. 13-14, B.C.\r\n356), and at this time was being restored by the joint efforts of the\r\nIonian cities. See _Strabo_, xiv. 1. Heropythus and Syrphax are not\r\nmentioned by any other writers.\r\n\r\n[149] This was the Carian Magnesia, situated on the Lethaeus, a\r\ntributary of the Maeander. Tralles was on the Eudon, another tributary\r\nof the Maeander. See _Juvenal_, iii. 70.\r\n\r\n[150] Lysimachus was of mean origin, his father having been a serf\r\nin Sicily. He was one of Alexander’s confidential body-guards, and\r\non the death of the great king obtained Thrace as his portion of the\r\ndismembered empire. In conjunction with Seleucus he won the battle of\r\nIpsus, by which he obtained a great part of Asia Minor. He ultimately\r\nacquired all the European dominions of Alexander in addition to Asia\r\nMinor; but in his eightieth year he was defeated and slain by Seleucus\r\nat the battle of Corus, B.C. 281. Sintenis was the first to substitute\r\n_Lysimachus_ for _Antimachus_, the reading of the MSS. Cf. vi. 28 infra.\r\n\r\n[151] Eleven in number. See _Herodotus_, i. 149-151.\r\n\r\n[152] Thirteen in number, of which Miletus and Ephesus were the chief\r\nin importance.\r\n\r\n[153] For the celebrated interview of Alexander with Apelles at\r\nEphesus, see Aelian (_Varia Historia_, ii. 3).\r\n\r\n[154] Cf. _Herodotus_, vi. 7. Here the Persians destroyed the Ionic\r\nfleet, B.C. 497.\r\n\r\n[155] Famous for the victory won near it by Leotychides and Xanthippus\r\nover the Persians, B.C. 479.\r\n\r\n[156] Cf. Vergil (_Aeneid_, vi. 3). _Obvertunt pelago proras._ See\r\nConington’s note.\r\n\r\n[157] _Strabo_ (xiv. 1) says that Miletus had four harbours.\r\n\r\n[158] ἐφομαρτούντων. This word is rare in\r\nprose. See Homer (_Iliad_, viii. 191); _Apollonius Rhodius_, i. 201.\r\n\r\n[159] Miletus lay nearly ten miles south of the mouth of the Maeander.\r\n\r\n[160] A similar stratagem was used by Lysander at Aegospotami, B.C.\r\n405. See Xenophon (_Hellenics_, ii. 1).\r\n\r\n[161] Iassus was a city in Caria on the Iassian Gulf, founded by the\r\nArgives and further colonized by the Milesians.\r\n\r\n[162] Caria formed the south-west angle of Asia Minor. The Greeks\r\nasserted that the Carians were emigrants from Crete. We learn from\r\nThucydides and Herodotus that they entered the service of foreign\r\nrulers. They formed the body-guard of queen Athaliah, who had usurped\r\nthe throne and stood in need of foreign mercenaries. The word\r\ntranslated in our Bible in 2 Kings xi. 4, 19 as _captains_, ought to be\r\nrendered _Carians_. See Fuerst’s _Hebrew Lexicon_, _sub voce_ כָּרִֽי\r\n\r\n[163] Now called Budrum. It was the birthplace of the historians\r\nHerodotus and Dionysius.\r\n\r\n[164] Little more than half a mile.\r\n\r\n[165] Now called Melasso, a city of Caria, about ten miles from the\r\nGulf of Iassus.\r\n\r\n[166] A colony of Troezen, on the western extremity of the same\r\npeninsula on which stood Halicarnassus.\r\n\r\n[167] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 25) says that this incident occurred in the\r\nnight, which is scarcely probable. Compare the conduct of the two\r\ncenturions Pulfio and Varenus in the country of the Nervii. Cæsar\r\n(_Gallic War_, v. 44).\r\n\r\n[168] Compare the sieges of Avaricum, Gergovia, and Alesia by Cæsar\r\n(_Gallic War_, lib. vii.); and that of Saguntum by Hannibal. See\r\n_Livy_, xxi. 7-15.\r\n\r\n[169] This use of ἀμφί with the Dative, is poetical. The Attic writers\r\nuse περί with the Accusative. Cf. ii. 3, 8; iii. 30, 1.\r\n\r\n[170] There were at least four generals in Alexander’s army of this\r\nname. The one here mentioned was probably not the famous son of Lagus.\r\n\r\n[171] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 25-27) gives a very different account of the\r\nlast struggle of the besieged in Halicarnassus. When the leaders saw\r\nthat they must eventually succumb, they made a last desperate effort to\r\ndestroy Alexander’s military engines. Ephialtes, the eminent Athenian\r\nexile, headed the sally, which was effected by troops simultaneously\r\nissuing from all the gates at daybreak. The advanced guard of the\r\nMacedonians, consisting of young troops, were put to rout; but the\r\nveterans of Philip restored the battle under a man named Atharrias.\r\nEphialtes was slain, and his men driven back into the city.\r\n\r\n[172] Hecatomnus, king of Caria, left three sons, Mausolus, Hidrieus,\r\nand Pixodarus; and two daughters, Artemisia and Ada. Artemisia married\r\nMausolus, and Ada married Hidrieus. All these children succeeded their\r\nfather in the sovereignty, Pixodarus being the last surviving son.\r\n\r\n[173] Amyntas, king of Macedonia, grandfather of Alexander the Great,\r\nadopted the celebrated Athenian general Iphicrates, in gratitude to him\r\nas the preserver of Macedonia. See Aeschines (_De Falsa Legatione_, pp.\r\n249, 250).\r\n\r\n[174] See _Arrian_, ii. 20 infra.\r\n\r\n[175] The Marmarians alone defended their city with desperate valour.\r\nThey finally set fire to it, and escaped through the Macedonian camp to\r\nthe mountains. See _Diodorus_ (xvii. 28). As to Xanthus the river, see\r\nHomer (_Iliad_, ii. 877; vi. 172); Horace (_Carm._, iv. 6, 26).\r\n\r\n[176] Lycia was originally called Milyas; but the name was afterwards\r\napplied to the high table in the north of Lycia, extending into\r\nPisidia. See _Herodotus_, i. 173.\r\n\r\n[177] Phaselis was a seaport of Lycia on the Gulf of Pamphylia. It is\r\nnow called Tekrova.\r\n\r\n[178] He also crowned with garlands the statue of Theodectes the\r\nrhetorician, which the people of Phaselis, his native city, had erected\r\nto his memory. This man was a friend and pupil of Aristotle, the tutor\r\nof Alexander. See Plutarch (_Life of Alex._, 17); Aristotle (_Nicom.\r\nEthics_, vii. 7).\r\n\r\n[179] Philip was murdered by Pausanias. Three only of his reputed\r\naccomplices are known by name, and they were Alexander, Heromenes, and\r\nArrhabaeus, sons of Aëropus. The two latter were put to death; but the\r\nfirst named was not only spared, but advanced to high military command\r\nfor being the first to salute Alexander as king. Compare _Curtius_\r\n(vii. 1); _Justin_ (xi. 2). Alexander was accused by some of forgiving\r\nhis father’s murderers. Probably the reference was to his kind\r\ntreatment of Olympias and this Alexander. See _Curtius_, vi. 43.\r\n\r\n[180] That of the Hellespontine Phrygia. See chap. xvii. supra.\r\n\r\n[181] See chap. xvii. supra.\r\n\r\n[182] Nearly £250,000.\r\n\r\n[183] See chap. xi. supra.\r\n\r\n[184] Compare Plutarch (_Alex._, 17). Just as the historians of\r\nAlexander affirmed that the sea near Pamphylia providentially made\r\nway for him, so the people of Thapsacus, when they saw the army of\r\nCyrus cross the Euphrates on foot, said that the river made way for\r\nhim to come and take the sceptre (Xen., _Anab._, i. 4). So also the\r\ninhabitants prostrated themselves before Lucullus when the same\r\nriver subsided and allowed his army to cross (Plutarch, _Lucullus_,\r\nchap. xxiv.). There was the same omen in the reign of Tiberius,\r\nwhen Vitellius, with a Roman army, crossed the Euphrates to restore\r\nTiridates to the throne of Parthia (Tacitus, _Annals_, vi. 37). Cf.\r\n_Strabo_, xiv. 3.\r\n\r\n[185] Aspendus was on the Eurymedon.\r\n\r\n[186] About £12,000.\r\n\r\n[187] Sidē was on the coast of Pamphylia, a little west of the river\r\nMelas.\r\n\r\n[188] Syllium was about five miles from the coast, between Aspendus and\r\nSide.\r\n\r\n[189] This river is celebrated for the double victory of Cimon the\r\nAthenian over the Persians, in B.C. 466. See Smith’s _Greece_, p. 252;\r\n_Grote_, vol. v. p. 163.\r\n\r\n[190] This lake is mentioned by _Herodotus_ (vii. 30), as being near\r\nthe city of Anava. It is now called Burdur.\r\n\r\n[191] Here Cyrus the Younger reviewed his Grecian forces and found them\r\nto be 11,000 hoplites and 2,000 peltasts. Here that prince had a palace\r\nand park, in which rose the river Maeander, close to the source of the\r\nMarsyas. See Xenophon (_Anab._, i. 2); compare _Curtius_ (iii. 1).\r\n\r\n[192] _Curtius_ (iii. 1) says they made a truce with Alexander for\r\nsixty days.\r\n\r\n[193] Antigonus, called the One-eyed, was father of Demetrius\r\nPoliorcetes. On the division of Alexander’s empire he received Phrygia,\r\nLycia, and Pamphylia. He eventually acquired the whole of Asia Minor;\r\nbut was defeated and slain at the battle of Ipsus by the allied forces\r\nof Cassander, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus (B.C. 301). When he was\r\nslain he was in his eighty-first year.\r\n\r\n[194] Balacrus was left by Alexander to command in Egypt. See _Arrian_\r\n(iii. 5).\r\n\r\n[195] The capital of the old Phrygian kings. It was rebuilt in the time\r\nof Augustus, and called Juliopolis.\r\n\r\n[196] This Ptolemy was killed at the battle of Issus (_Arrian_, ii.\r\n110).\r\n\r\n[197] We learn from _Curtius_ (iv. 34) that Alexander released these\r\nprisoners at the request of ambassadors from Athens, who met him in\r\nSyria after his return from Egypt.\r\n\r\n[198] The other cities of Lesbos were Methymna, Antissa, Eresus, and\r\nPyrrha.\r\n\r\n[199] Now called Cape Sigri, the west point of the island.\r\n\r\n[200] The southern point of Euboea, now called Cape Mandili. Cf. Homer\r\n(_Odyss._, iii. 177).\r\n\r\n[201] The south-eastern point of Laconia, now called Cape Malia di St.\r\nAngelo. It was dreaded by ancient mariners; see Homer (_Odyssey_, ix.\r\n80); Ovid (_Amores_, ii. 16, 24); Vergil (_Aeneid_, v. 193). There was\r\na saying:—Μαλέας δὲ κάμψας ἐπιλάθου τῶν οἴκαδε (_Strabo_, viii. p. 250).\r\n\r\n[202] In accordance with the convention of Corinth. Compare next\r\nchapter. For the pillars compare _Herodotus_ (ii. 102, 106);\r\n_Thucydides_ (v. 18, 47, 56); Aristophanes (_Acharnians_, 727;\r\n_Lysistrata_, 513).\r\n\r\n[203] This treaty was concluded by the Spartans with the king of\r\nPersia, B.C. 387. It was designed to break up the Athenian supremacy.\r\nIt stipulated that all the Grecian colonies in Asia were to be given\r\nto the Persian king; the Athenians were to retain only Imbros, Lesbos,\r\nand Scyros; and all the other Grecian cities were to be autonomous. See\r\nXenophon (_Hellenics_, iv. 8; v. 1).\r\n\r\n[204] Cf. ii. 13 infra.\r\n\r\n[205] “Cyclades ideo sic appellatae, quod omnes ambiunt Delon partu\r\ndeorum insignem.”—_Ammianus_, xxii. 8, 2. Cf. Horace (_Carm._, i. 14,\r\n19; iii. 28, 14).\r\n\r\n[206] Cf. Vergil (_Aeneid_, ii. 21).\r\n\r\n[207] The regent of Macedonia and Greece during Alexander’s absence.\r\n\r\n[208] One of the Cyclades, a little to the north-east of Melos. It\r\nwas noted for the low morality of its inhabitants. See Aristophanes\r\n(_Fragment_, 558; on the authority of Suidas).\r\n\r\n[209] Euripus properly means any narrow sea, where the ebb and flow\r\nof the tide is violent. The name was especially applied to the strait\r\nbetween Boeotia and Euboea, where the ancients asserted the sea ebbed\r\nand flowed seven times in the day (_Strabo_, ix. 1). Modern observers\r\nhave noticed these extraordinary tides. The present name of the\r\nisland, Negropont, is the Italian name formed from Egripo, the modern\r\ncorruption of Euripus. Cf. Cicero, _pro Muraena_, xvii.:—Quod fretum,\r\nquem Euripum tot motus, tantas, tam varias habere putatis agitationes\r\nfluctuum, quantas perturbationes et quantos aestus habet ratio\r\ncomitiorum. Aristotle, _Ethica Nicomachea_, ix. 6:—τῶν τοιούτων γὰρ\r\nμένει τὰ βουλήματα, καὶ οὐ μεταῤῥεῖ ὥσπερ Εὔριπος.\r\n\r\n[210] One of the Cyclades, about half-way between Attica and Siphnus.\r\n\r\n[211] ἐπιπτῆναι, a poetical form for ἐπιπτέσθαι.\r\n\r\n[212] Cf. _Justin_, xi. 7.\r\n\r\n[213] Cf. _Curtius_, iii. 2 (Zumpt’s edition); Plutarch (_Alexander_,\r\n18).\r\n\r\n[214] Now called Angora. In the time of Alexander the country was named\r\nGreat Phrygia, the term Galatia being afterwards applied to it, from\r\nthe fact that it was conquered by the Gauls in the 3rd century B.C.\r\n\r\n[215] Now called Kizil-Irmak, _i.e._ the Red River. It is the largest\r\nriver in Asia Minor, and separated the empires of Persia and Lydia,\r\nuntil the conquest of the latter by Cyrus.\r\n\r\n[216] The chief pass over the Taurus between Cappadocia and Cilicia.\r\nIt is more than 3,600 feet above the sea-level. Its modern name is\r\nGolek-Boghaz. Cf. _Curtius_, iii. 9-11. It is called Tauri Pylae by\r\nCicero (_Epistolae ad Atticum_, v. 20, 2).\r\n\r\n[217] See Xenophon (_Anabasis_, i. 2, 20, 21).\r\n\r\n[218] _Curtius_ (iii. 11) says, that Alexander wondered at his own\r\ngood fortune, when he observed how easily Arsames might have blocked\r\nup the pass. Cyrus the Younger was equally fortunate in finding this\r\nimpregnable pass abandoned by Syennesis, king of Cilicia. See Xenophon\r\n(_Anabasis_, i. 2, 21).\r\n\r\n[219] Now called Tersoos-Chai. See _Curtius_, iii. 12; _Justin_, xi. 8;\r\nand Lucian (_De Domo_, i.). At Tarsus the emperor Julian was buried.\r\nSee _Ammianus_, xxv. 10, 5.\r\n\r\n[220] Probably none of the physicians would venture to prescribe, for\r\nfear of being held responsible for his death, which seemed likely to\r\nensue. Nine years after, when Hephaestion died of fever at Ecbatana,\r\nAlexander caused the physician who had attended him to be crucified.\r\nSee _Arrian_, vii. 14; Plutarch (_Alexander_, 72).\r\n\r\n[221] Cf. _Curtius_, iii. 14-16; _Diodorus_, xvii. 31; _Justin_, xi.\r\n8; Plutarch (_Alex._, 19). The barbarous conduct of Alexander towards\r\nPhilotas four years after, when contrasted with his noble confidence\r\nin Philip, shows the bad effect of his unparalleled success, upon his\r\nmoral character.\r\n\r\n[222] This pass was called the _Syrian Gates_, lying between the shore\r\nof the Gulf of Issus and Mount Amanus. Cyrus the Younger was six days\r\nmarching from Tarsus through this pass. See Xenophon (_Anab._, i. 4).\r\nThe Greeks often gave the name of Assyria to the country usually called\r\nby them Syria. The Hebrew name for it is Aram (highland). Cf. Cicero\r\n(_ad Diversos_, xv. 4, 4); _Diod._, xiv. 21.\r\n\r\n[223] A city of Cilicia on the coast, a little west of the mouth of the\r\nCydnus.\r\n\r\n[224] Said to have been the last of the Assyrian kings.\r\n\r\n[225] Cf. _Strabo_ (xiv. 5) for a description of this statue.\r\n\r\n[226] This was, doubtless, the arrow-headed writing which has\r\nbeen deciphered by Sir Henry Rawlinson. Cf. _Herodotus_, iv. 87;\r\n_Thucydides_, iv. 50.\r\n\r\n[227] Now called Mezetlu. It was a Rhodian colony on the coast of\r\nCilicia, between the rivers Cydnus and Lamus. It was afterwards\r\nre-named Pompeiopolis. The birthplace of Philemon, Aratus, and\r\nChrysippus.\r\n\r\n[228] About £49,000.\r\n\r\n[229] Asander was a nephew of Parmenio. He afterwards brought a\r\nreinforcement to Alexander from Greece (_Arrian_, iv. 7). After the\r\nking’s death he obtained the rule of Caria, but joining the party of\r\nPtolemy and Cassander, he was defeated by Antigonus, b.c. 313.\r\n\r\n[230] These were Carian cities.\r\n\r\n[231] Cos, the birthplace of Apelles and Hippocrates, is one of the\r\ngroup of islands called Sporades, off the coast of Caria. Triopium is\r\nthe promontory terminating the peninsula of Cnidus, the south-west\r\nheadland of Asia Minor. Cf. _Tibullus_, ii. 3, 57; _Propertius_, i. 2,\r\n1; ii. 1, 5; _Herodotus_, i. 174.\r\n\r\n[232] Called by the Romans, Aesculapius. He was the god of the medical\r\nart, and no doubt Alexander sacrificed to him, and celebrated the\r\ngames, in gratitude for his recovery from the fever he had had at\r\nTarsus.\r\n\r\n[233] This plain is mentioned in _Homer_, vi. 201; _Herodotus_, vi.\r\n95. The large river Pyramus, now called Jihan, falls into the sea near\r\nMallus.\r\n\r\n[234] Mallus was said to have been founded by Amphilochus after the\r\nfall of Troy. This hero was the son of Amphiaraüs, the great prophet of\r\nArgos, whom Zeus is said to have made immortal. Magarsus, of Megarsa,\r\nwas the port of Mallus. The difference of meaning between θύειν\r\nand ἐναγίζειν is seen from _Herodotus_, ii. 44; Plutarch (_Moralia_,\r\nii. p. 857 D).\r\n\r\n[235] Usually called the Syrian Gates. See chap. v. note^1 supra.\r\n\r\n[236] A city on the Gulf of Issus, being a settlement of the\r\nPhoenicians. _Herodotus_ (iv. 38) calls the gulf the Myriandric Gulf.\r\nCf. Xenophon (_Anab._, 4).\r\n\r\n[237] Cf. _Arrian_, vii. 29; _Curtius_, viii. 17.\r\n\r\n[238] Aeschines tells us in his speech against Ctesiphon (p. 552), that\r\nthe anti-Macedonian statesmen at Athens at this time received letters\r\nfrom their friends, stating that Alexander was caught and pinned up\r\nin Cilicia. He says Demosthenes went about showing these letters and\r\nboasting of the news. Josephus (_Antiquities of the Jews_, xi. 7, 3)\r\nsays that “not only Sanballat at Samaria but all those that were in\r\nAsia also were persuaded that the Macedonians would not so much as come\r\nto a battle with the Persians, on account of their multitude.”\r\n\r\n[239] There are two passes by which the eastern countries are entered\r\nfrom Cilicia; one on the south, near the sea, leads into Syria. The\r\nother pass lies more to the north, and leads to the country near the\r\nEuphrates. The latter was called the Amanic, and the former the Syrian\r\ngate. Alexander had just passed through the Syrian gate in order to\r\nmarch against Darius, at the very time that Darius was descending\r\ninto Cilicia by the Amanic gate, and occupying Issus with his\r\nadvanced guard. Alexander, who had reached Myriandrus in Syria, made\r\na countermarch to meet Darius. Plutarch (_Alex._, 20) says that they\r\nmissed each other in the night, which is quite a mistake.\r\n\r\n[240] Cf. Sallust (_Catilina_, 59); Cæsar (_Bell. Gall._, ii. 25).\r\n\r\n[241] See Xenophon (_Anab._, iii. 3).\r\n\r\n[242] At Cunaxa. _Xenophon_ (ii. 2, 6) does not mention the name of the\r\nplace where the battle was fought, but says that he was informed it was\r\nonly 360 stadia (about 40 miles) from Babylon. We get the name Cunaxa\r\nfrom Plutarch (_Life of Artaxerxes_, c. 8), who says it was 500 stadia\r\n(about 58 miles) from Babylon.\r\n\r\n[243] Callisthenes the historian, who accompanied Alexander into Asia,\r\nstates that the breadth of the plain between the mountain and the sea\r\nwas not more than fourteen stadia, or a little more than one English\r\nmile and a half. See _Polybius_, xii. 17.\r\n\r\n[244] These seem to have been foreign mercenaries. See _Polybius_, v.\r\n79, 82; _Strabo_, xv. 3. Hesychius says that they were not a nation,\r\nbut foreigners serving for pay.\r\n\r\n[245] Callisthenes—as quoted in _Polybius_, xii. 18—reckoned the\r\nGrecian mercenaries of Darius at 30,000, and the cavalry at 30,000.\r\nArrian enumerates 90,000 heavy-armed, not including the cavalry. Yet\r\nPolybius tries to prove that there was not room even for the 60,000\r\ntroops mentioned by Callisthenes.\r\n\r\n[246] “The depth of this single phalanx is not given, nor do we know\r\nthe exact width of the ground which it occupied. Assuming a depth of\r\nsixteen, and one pace in breadth to each soldier, 4,000 men would stand\r\nin the breadth of a stadium of 250 paces; and therefore 80,000 men in\r\na breadth of twenty stadia. Assuming a depth of twenty-six, 6,500 men\r\nwould stand in the breadth of the stadium, and therefore 90,000 in a\r\ntotal breadth of 14 stadia, which is that given by Kallisthenes. Mr.\r\nKinneir states that the breadth between Mount Amanus and the sea varies\r\nbetween one and a half mile and three miles.”—_Grote._\r\n\r\n[247] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 31), and Plutarch (_Alex._, 18), give the\r\nsame number; but _Justin_ (xi. 9) says the Persians numbered 400,000\r\ninfantry and 100,000 cavalry. It took five days for them to cross the\r\nEuphrates, over bridges of boats (_Curtius_, iii. 17). The money alone\r\nof the king required 600 mules and 300 camels to convey it (_Curtius_,\r\niii. 8).\r\n\r\n[248] Cf. _Arrian_, iii. 11; and Xenophon (_Anab._, i. 8, 21, 22).\r\n\r\n[249] See Donaldson’s _New Cratylus_, sect. 178.\r\n\r\n[250] Cf. Xenophon (_Cyropaedia_, vii. 1, 6).\r\n\r\n[251] In describing the battle of Arbela, Arrian mentions eight\r\ndistinct squadrons of Macedonian heavy cavalry, which was known by\r\nthe name of the Companions. Among the squadrons several, if not all,\r\nwere named after particular towns or districts of Macedonia, as here,\r\nAnthemus, and Leuge. We also find mention of the squadrons of Bottiaea,\r\nAmphipolis, and Apollonia. See also _Arrian_, i. 2; i. 12; iii. 11.\r\n\r\n[252] τῇ γνώμῃ δεδουλωμένος. An expression imitated from _Thucydides_,\r\niv. 34; compare _Arrian_, iii. 11; v. 19; vi. 16, where the same words\r\nare used of Porus and the Indians.\r\n\r\n[253] κυμῆναν τῆς φάλαγγος. An expression imitated from Xenophon\r\n(_Anab._, i. 8,18). It is praised by Demetrius (_De Elocutione_, 84).\r\nKrüger reads ἐκκυμῆναν. Cf. Plutarch (_Pompey_, 69).\r\n\r\n[254] _Curtius_ (iii. 29) says that on Alexander’s side 504 were\r\nwounded, and 182 killed. _Diodorus_ (xvii. 36) says, that 450\r\nMacedonians were killed. _Justin_ (xi. 9) states that 280 were slain.\r\n\r\n[255] Polybius, who lived nearly three centuries before Arrian,\r\ncensures Callisthenes for asserting that the Persian cavalry\r\ncrossed the river Pinarus and attacked the Thessalians. No doubt\r\nArrian received this information from the lost works of Ptolemy and\r\nAristobulus (_Poly._, xii. 18).\r\n\r\n[256] ἀμβάτης is the poetical form of ἀναβάτης,\r\nthe word used by Xenophon, Plato, and other Attic writers.\r\nThe latter is found only once in Arrian (III. xiii. 5).\r\n\r\n[257] ἢ τῶν πεζῶν is Martin’s emendation for ἢ ὡς πεζῶν.\r\n\r\n[258] _Curtius_ (iii. 27) and _Diodorus_ (xvii. 34) give a graphic\r\ndescription of a direct charge made by Alexander upon Darius, and a\r\nsanguinary conflict between Alexander’s body-guard and the Persian\r\nnobles, in which the Great King’s horses were wounded and became\r\nunmanageable, whereupon Darius got out, mounted a horse, and fled.\r\nWe learn from Plutarch (_Alex._, 20) that Chares affirmed Alexander\r\ncame into hand-to-hand conflict with Darius, and that he received\r\na wound in the thigh from that king’s sword. Plutarch says that\r\nAlexander wrote to Antipater that he had been wounded in the thigh\r\nwith a dagger, but did not say by whom. He also wrote that nothing\r\nserious had resulted from the wound. The account of Arrian is far the\r\nmost trustworthy. Callisthenes stated that Alexander made a direct\r\nattack upon Darius (_Polybius_, xii. 22). We know from Xenophon that\r\nthe Persian kings were in the habit of occupying the centre, and that\r\nCyrus directed Clearchus to make the attack against the person of his\r\nbrother Artaxerxes at the battle of Cunaxa. Polybius seems to have\r\nbeen ignorant of this custom of the Persian kings when he wrote his\r\ncriticism on the statement of Callisthenes.\r\n\r\n[259] ἀφείλετο. On this word see Donaldson (_New\r\nCratylus_, sect. 315). Cf. Aeschўlus (_Persae_, 428); _Thucydides_ (iv.\r\n134); Xenophon (_Hellenics_, i. 2, 16).\r\n\r\n[260] The victories of the Greeks and Macedonians over the Persians\r\nwere materially aided by the pusillanimity of Xerxes and Darius.\r\nCompare the conduct of Xerxes at Salamis (_Herodotus_, viii. 97;\r\nAeschўlus, _Persae_, 465-470, with Mr. Paley’s note) and that of Darius\r\nat Arbela (_Arrian_, iii. 14).\r\n\r\n[261] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 36) and _Curtius_ (iii. 29) agree with Arrian\r\nas to the number of slain in the army of Darius. Plutarch (_Alex._, 20)\r\ngives the number as 110,000.\r\n\r\n[262] _Justin_ (xi. 9) agrees with Arrian, that the wife of Darius was\r\nalso his sister. Grote speaks of the mother, wife, and sister of Darius\r\nbeing captured, which is an error. _Diodorus_ (xvii. 38) and _Curtius_\r\n(iii. 29) say that the son was about six years of age.\r\n\r\n[263] Cf. Xenophon (_Cyropaedia_, ii. 1, 3; vii. 5, 85).\r\n\r\n[264] Damascus,—the Hebrew name of which is Dammesek,—a very ancient\r\ncity in Syria, at the foot of the Antilibanus, at an elevation of 220\r\nfeet above the sea, in a spacious and fertile plain about 30 miles in\r\ndiameter, which is watered by three rivers, two of which are called in\r\nthe Bible Abana and Pharpar. It has still a population of 150,000. The\r\nemperor Julian, in one of his letters, calls it “the Eye of all the\r\nEast.”\r\n\r\n[265] About £730,000.\r\n\r\n[266] B.C. 333; end of October or beginning of November.\r\n\r\n[267] Alexander erected three altars on the bank of the Pinarus, to\r\nZeus, Heracles, and Athena (_Curtius_, iii. 33). Cicero, who was\r\nproconsul of Cilicia, speaks of “the altars of Alexander at the foot\r\nof Amanus,” and says that he encamped there four days (_Epistolae ad\r\nDiversos_, xv. 4).\r\n\r\n[268] About £12,000.\r\n\r\n[269] This distinguished general saved Alexander’s life in India,\r\nin the assault on the city of the Mallians. After the king’s death,\r\nhe received the rule of the lesser or Hellespontine Phrygia. He was\r\ndefeated and slain by the Athenians under Antiphilus, against whom he\r\nwas fighting in alliance with Antipater, B.C. 323. See _Diodorus_,\r\nxviii. 14, 15; Plutarch (_Phocion_, 25).\r\n\r\n[270] Compare _Diodorus_, xvii. 37, 38; _Curtius_, iii. 29-32.\r\n\r\n[271] Named Sisygambis.\r\n\r\n[272] In a letter written by Alexander to Parmenio, an extract from\r\nwhich is preserved by Plutarch (_Alex._, 22), he says that he never saw\r\nnor entertained the desire of seeing the wife of Darius, who was said\r\nto be the most beautiful woman in Asia; and that he would not allow\r\nhimself to listen to those who spoke about her beauty. Cf. _Ammianus_\r\n(xxiv. 4, 27), speaking of Julian: “Ex virginibus autem, quae speciosae\r\nsunt captae, ut in Perside, ubi feminarum pulchritudo excellit,\r\nnec contrectare aliquam voluit, nec videre: Alexandrum imitatus et\r\nAfricanum, qui haec declinabant, ne frangeretur cupiditate, qui se\r\ninvictos a laboribus ubique praestiterunt.”\r\n\r\n[273] Thapsacus is understood to be identical with the city called\r\nTiphsach (passage) in 1 Kings iv. 24; which is there said to have been\r\nthe eastern boundary of Solomon’s empire. It is generally supposed that\r\nthe modern Deir occupies the site of the ancient Thapsacus; but it has\r\nbeen discovered that the only ford in this part of the river is at\r\nSuriyeh, 165 miles above Deir. This was probably the site of Thapsacus.\r\nFrom the time of Seleucus Nicator the city was called Amphipolis\r\n(_Pliny_, v. 21). See _Stephanus_ of Byzantium, _sub voce_ Amphipolis.\r\nCf. Xenophon (_Anabasis_, i. 4, 11).\r\n\r\n[274] The Euphrates is the largest river of western Asia, and rises in\r\nthe mountains of Armenia. It unites with the Tigris, and after a course\r\nof 1,780 miles flows into the Persian Gulf. It is navigable by boats\r\nfor 1,200 miles. The annual inundation, caused by the melting of the\r\nsnow in the mountains of Armenia, takes place in the month of May. The\r\nEuphrates, Tigris, and Eulaeus had formerly three separate outlets into\r\nthe Persian Gulf; but the three now unite in a single stream, which is\r\ncalled Shat-el-Arab. The Hebrew name for the river which the Greeks\r\ncalled Euphrates, was Pĕrath (rapid stream). It is called in the Bible,\r\nthe _Great River_, and _the River_ (Gen. xv. 18; Exod. xxiii. 31; _et\r\npassim_). In Jeremiah xiii. 4-7, the word _Pĕrath_ stands for Ephrath,\r\nanother name for Bethlehem; in our Bible it is mis-translated. See\r\nFürst’s _Hebrew Lexicon_.\r\n\r\n[275] The term _Cĕnaan_ was applied to the lowland plain from Aradus\r\nto Gaza. The northern portion, from Aradus to Carmel, is known to\r\nus under its Grecian name of Phoenicia, which is probably derived\r\nfrom the Greek _phoinix_ (a palm-tree), which grew abundantly in the\r\ncountry, and was the emblem of some of its towns. Others derive it from\r\nanother Greek word _phoinix_ (red dye), which formed one of its most\r\nimportant manufactures. The Phoenicians applied the term Cenaan to\r\ntheir land in contrast to the highlands to the west, which they called\r\n_Aram_ (highland), the Hebrew name for Syria. The country of Phoenicia\r\nwas 120 miles long and with an average breadth of 12 miles, never\r\nexceeding 20 miles. The chief cities of Phoenicia were Tyre, Sidon,\r\nAradus, Byblus, Berytus, Tripolis, and Accho or Ptolemais. Its central\r\nposition between the eastern and western countries, early developed\r\nits commercial power, and its intercourse with foreign nations at an\r\nearly period produced an advanced state of civilization and refinement.\r\nThe Phoenicians were a Semitic nation like the Israelites; and their\r\nlanguage bears a remarkable affinity with the Hebrew, as is seen by\r\nfragments of the Carthaginian language preserved in Plautus. In an\r\ninscription discovered at Marseilles in 1845, out of 94 words 74\r\nwere found in the Hebrew Bible. The Phoenicians were asserted by the\r\nGreeks to have communicated to them the knowledge of letters; and this\r\nstatement is corroborated by the similarity of the Hebrew and ancient\r\nGreek letters. Their colonies spread from Cyprus to Crete and the\r\nCyclades, thence to Euboea, Greece, and Thrace. The coasts of Asia\r\nMinor and Bithynia were dotted with their settlements, and they carried\r\ntheir commerce into the Black Sea. They also had colonies in Sicily,\r\nSardinia, Ivica, and Spain, where they founded Cadiz. The northern\r\ncoast of Africa was lined with their colonies, the most flourishing of\r\nwhich was Carthage, which rose to be one of the great powers of the\r\nworld. Strabo says that they had 300 colonies on the western coast of\r\nAfrica. They visited the coasts of England for tin; and thus, to quote\r\nthe words of Humboldt, “the Tyrian flag waved at the same time in\r\nBritain and the Indian Ocean.” _Herodotus_ (iv. 42, 43) says that under\r\nthe patronage of Necho, king of Egypt, they circumnavigated Africa; but\r\nhe states that he does not believe it was a fact. The reason which he\r\nassigns for his disbelief is, that the navigators alleged that the sun\r\nwas on their right hand, which is the strongest argument in favour of\r\nthe truth of their statement. In Isaiah xxiii. 11, Phoenicia is called\r\nCĕnaan, where the English Bible has erroneously, _the merchant city_.\r\nIn the Bible the word _Cĕnaanim_ is frequently used for _merchants_,\r\nbecause the Phoenicians were the principal commercial people of\r\nantiquity (Job xli. 6; Prov. xxxi. 24; Isaiah xxiii. 8; Hos. xii.\r\n7; Zeph. i. 2; Zech. xiv. 21). Tripolis consisted of three distinct\r\ncities, 600 feet apart, each having its own walls, but all united in\r\na common constitution with one place of assembly. These cities were\r\ncolonies respectively of Sidon, Tyre, and Aradus. Tripolis was a\r\nflourishing port on a headland which is a spur of Lebanon. It is now\r\ncalled Tripoli, and is still a large town. See Dr. Smith’s _Dictionary\r\nof Classical Geography_.\r\n\r\n[276] The oldest towns in Cyprus,—Citium, Amathus, and Paphus,—were\r\nPhoenician colonies. These were afterwards eclipsed by the Greek\r\ncolonies, Salamis, Soli, and New Paphus. In Hebrew the island is\r\ncalled _Ceth_, and the inhabitants _Cittim_. Gesenius says, that upon\r\na Sidonian coin _Ceth_ in Cyprus, which the Greeks called Citium, is\r\ndescribed as a Sidonian colony. _Diodorus_ (xvi. 42) says there were\r\nnine kings in Cyprus. It is probable that the kings of the Hittites\r\nmentioned in 1 Kings x. 29, were from Cyprus. Also the Hittite women\r\nwhom Solomon married were probably Cyprians (1 Kings xi. 1). The kings\r\nof the Hittites of whom the Syrians were afraid were also Cypriotes (2\r\nKings vii. 6); and the _land of the Hittites_ mentioned in Judges i.\r\n26, probably means Cyprus. Josephus, Eusebius, and Jerome understand\r\nthese passages to refer to Cyprus. In Isaiah xxiii. 1, the _land\r\nof Cittim_ refers to Cyprus, which belonged to Tyre, the revolt of\r\nwhich the prophet announced. This revolt is confirmed by Menander\r\n(_Josephus_, ix. 14, 9).\r\n\r\n[277] Agis III. was ultimately defeated and slain by Antipater, B.C.\r\n330. See _Curtius_, vi. 1 and 2; Grote’s _Greece_, vol. xii. pp.\r\n102-106.\r\n\r\n[278] About £7,300.\r\n\r\n[279] Now Cape Matapan. Cf. _Propertius_, iii. 2, 11; _Tibullus_, iii.\r\n3, 13; Homer (_Hymn to Apollo_, 411).\r\n\r\n[280] The Cretans were very early civilized and powerful, for we read\r\nin Homer of their 100 cities. Before the Trojan war lived the famous\r\nking Minos, who is said to have given laws to Crete, and to have been\r\nthe first potentate who possessed a navy, with which he suppressed\r\npiracy in the Aegean Sea. The Cretans gradually degenerated, so that\r\nwe find in the New Testament St. Paul quoting from their own poet,\r\nEpimenides: “Always liars and beasts are the Cretans, and inwardly\r\nsluggish” (Titus i. 12). The lying propensity of the Cretans is proved\r\nfrom the fact that the verb _to Cretize_, was used in Greek with the\r\nmeaning “to speak falsely.” In Hebrew, Crete is called _Caphtor_\r\n(cypress). It is mentioned in Jer. xlvii. 4. It was the native land\r\nof a tribe of Philistines called Caphtorim (Gen. x. 14; Deut. ii. 23;\r\n1 Chron. i. 12). The fact that the Philistines came partly from Crete\r\nis also affirmed in Amos ix. 7. Another branch of the Philistines came\r\nfrom Casloach in Egypt. The Caphtorim emigrated originally from Egypt\r\nto Crete, from which island they were probably driven by the Greeks.\r\nTacitus asserts that the inhabitants of Palestine came from Crete\r\n(_Historiae_, v. 2); and the early name of Gaza was Minoa, after the\r\nfamous king of Crete. Another Hebrew name for Crete is Cĕrēth, whence\r\nthe inhabitants were called _Cĕrēthim_. They are mentioned in Ezek.\r\nxxv. 16, and Zeph. ii. 5; where the Septuagint and the Syriac have\r\n_Cretans_. We find the Philistines, who were partly emigrants from\r\nCrete, called Cerethim in 1 Sam. xxx. 14. From among these Cerethim\r\nand Philistines David chose his body-guard, which was composed of men\r\nskilled in shooting and slinging (2 Sam. viii. 18, xv. 18, xx. 7, 23; 1\r\nKings i. 38, 44; 1 Chron. xviii. 17).\r\n\r\n[281] From _Diodorus_ (xvii. 48) it appears that Agis went personally\r\nto Crete, and compelled most of the cities to join the Persian side. We\r\nalso learn that the deputies of the Greeks assembled at the Isthmian\r\ngames at Corinth sent an embassy to Alexander to congratulate him on\r\nhis victory at Issus, and to present him with a golden wreath. (See\r\nalso _Curtius_, iv. 22.)\r\n\r\n[282] Coele-Syria, or Hollow Syria, is, in its more limited sense,\r\nthe country between the ranges of Libanus and Anti-Libănus, in which\r\nDamascus and Baalbek are situated; in its wider meaning, it comprises\r\nthe whole of Northern Syria, in opposition to the countries of\r\nPhoenicia and Palestine.\r\n\r\n[283] Aradus is an island lying two or three miles from the mainland of\r\nPhoenicia. According to Strabo, a State was founded in it by refugees\r\nfrom Sidon. For a long time the island was independent, under its own\r\nkings; and even after it fell under the sway of the Macedonian kings\r\nof Syria, and subsequently under that of the Romans, it retained a\r\ngreat deal of its commercial prosperity. Aradus appears in Hebrew\r\nunder the form _Arvad_. It is evident from Ezek. xxvii. 8, 11, that\r\nits inhabitants were skilful sailors and brave warriors. They sent out\r\ncolonies to Aradus south of Carmel, the island of Aradus near Crete,\r\nand the islands in the Persian gulf. The present name of this island is\r\nRuad. The Aradians inhabited the mainland opposite the island, as well\r\nas the island itself.\r\n\r\n[284] Artaxerxes Ochus reigned B.C. 359-338.\r\n\r\n[285] Perinthus was a Samian colony on the Propontis. For the siege by\r\nPhilip, see _Diodorus_, xvi. 74-76.\r\n\r\n[286] Impartial historians deny that Philip’s murderers were bribed;\r\nthey committed the murder from private resentment.\r\n\r\n[287] Ochus was poisoned about B.C. 338, by the eunuch Bagoas, who\r\nplaced upon the throne Arses, one of the king’s sons, killing all the\r\nrest. Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_, vi. 8). Two years afterwards,\r\nBagoas put Arses and all his children to death; thus leaving no direct\r\nheir of the regal family alive. He then placed upon the throne one of\r\nhis adherents, named Darius Codomannus, a descendant of one of the\r\nbrothers of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Bagoas soon afterwards tried to poison\r\nthis Darius; but the latter, discovering his treachery, forced him to\r\ndrink the deadly draught himself (_Diod._, xvii. 5; _Justin_, x. 3).\r\nFrom _Arrian_, iii. 19, we learn that Bistanes, a son of Ochus, was\r\nalive after the battle of Arbela.\r\n\r\n[288] Aeschines, in his speech against Ctesiphon (p. 634), asserts\r\nthat Darius sent 300 talents to Athens, that the Athenians refused\r\nthem, and that Demosthenes took them, reserving 70 talents for his own\r\nprivate use. Deinarchus repeats this statement in his speech against\r\nDemosthenes. (pp. 9-14). If Demosthenes had really acted thus, it is\r\nstrange Alexander knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\n[289] This statement of Arrian is confirmed by _Curtius_ (iii. 34), who\r\nsays that Parmenio captured the treasure, not in the city, but from\r\nfugitives who were conveying it away.\r\n\r\n[290] In giving the names of the captured Grecian envoys, _Curtius_\r\n(iii. 35) seems to have confounded this with a future occasion,\r\nmentioned in _Arrian_ (iii. 24).\r\n\r\n[291] The great Iphicrates had been adopted by Alexander’s grandfather,\r\nas is stated in a note on Book I. chap. 23.\r\n\r\n[292] Byblus is said by _Strabo_ (xvi. 2) to have been situated on a\r\nheight not far from the sea. It was reported to be the oldest city in\r\nthe world. It possessed a considerable extent of territory, including\r\nBerytus, and was an independent State for a long period, the last king\r\nbeing deposed by Pompey. On a Byblus coin of Alexander’s time appears\r\nthe name _Einel_, which is the king Enylus mentioned by _Arrian_ (ii.\r\n20). Byblus was the chief seat of the worship of Adonis, or Thammuz,\r\nwho was supposed to have been born there. In the Bible it appears under\r\nits Hebrew name _Gebal_ (mountain-district). The inhabitants of Gebal\r\nare said in Ezek. xxvii. 9 to have been skilled in building ships. In\r\nJosh. xiii. 5 the northern boundary of the Holy Land is said to reach\r\nas far as the land of the Giblite, or inhabitant of Gebal. In 1 Kings\r\nv. 18 the word translated in our Bible _stone-squarers_ ought to be\r\nrendered _Giblites_. The Arabs still call the place Jebail. Cf. Milton\r\n(_Paradise Lost_, viii. 18).\r\n\r\n[293] Sidon, or in Hebrew _Tsidon_ (fortress), is called in Gen. x. 15,\r\n19 the firstborn son of Canaan, _i.e._ it was the first city founded\r\nby the Canaanites or Phoenicians. It lay about twenty miles south of\r\nTyre, on a small promontory two miles south of the river Bostremus. We\r\nread in _Homer_ that it was famous for its embroidered robes and metal\r\nutensils, and from other ancient writers we find that it manufactured\r\nglass and linen and also prepared dyes. Before the time of David it\r\nfell under the rule of Tyre; but when Shalmaneser, king of Assyria,\r\ninvaded Phoenicia, it revolted from Tyre and submitted to the invader.\r\nIt was governed by its own kings under the Babylonian and Persian\r\nempires; and under the latter power it reached its highest prosperity,\r\nsurpassing Tyre in wealth and importance. In the expedition of Xerxes\r\nagainst Greece, the Sidonians furnished the best ships in the whole\r\nfleet, and their king obtained the highest place under Xerxes in the\r\ncouncil. But they revolted against Ochus, king of Persia, and being\r\nbetrayed to him by their own king Tennes, they burnt their city and\r\nships. It is said that 40,000 persons perished in the fire and by the\r\nsword, B.C. 351. (_Diodorus_, xvi. 43-45). No doubt this barbarous\r\ntreatment of Ochus induced the Sidonians to take the side of Alexander.\r\nThe city was already built and again flourishing when that king\r\nappeared on the scene. Near the site of the ancient city is the present\r\ntown of Saida, with a population of about 5,000. Cf. Homer (_Iliad_,\r\nvi. 289; xxiii. 741); _Lucan_, iii. 217.\r\n\r\n[294] At Sidon, Alexander deposed the reigning king Strato, a friend\r\nof the Persians; and a poor man, named Abdalonymus, distantly related\r\nto the regal family, was put into his place (_Curtius_, iv. 3, 4).\r\n_Diodorus_ (xvii. 47) tells the same story, but applies it to Tyre,\r\nprobably by mistake.\r\n\r\n[295] The Hebrew name for Tyre is _Tsor_ (rock). In Isa. xxiii. 4 it\r\nis called the fortress of the sea; and in ver. 8, “Tsor, the crowning\r\none,” because Tyre gave rulers to the Phoenician cities and colonies.\r\nValuable information about the power, trade, and customs of Tyre\r\nis derived from Ezek. xxvi-xxviii.; and we learn the fact that she\r\nemployed mercenaries like her colony Carthage (Ezek. xxvii. 10, 11). In\r\nthe classical writers the name is corrupted into _Tyrus_, and sometimes\r\ninto _Sarra_. Tyre was unsuccessfully besieged for five years by\r\nShalmaneser. It was also besieged for thirteen years by Nebuchadnezzar,\r\nand in the end an alliance was formed, by which the Tyrians retained\r\ntheir own king as a vassal of the king of Babylon. This arrangement was\r\ncontinued under the kings of Persia.\r\n\r\n[296] _Curtius_ (iv. 7) tells us that the envoys also brought to\r\nAlexander a golden wreath, together with abundant supplies for his army.\r\n\r\n[297] This king must have brought home his ships for the defence of\r\nTyre, for he was in the city when it was captured. See chap. 24.\r\n\r\n[298] The Phoenician god _Melkarth_ (lord of the city), whom the\r\nSyrians called _Baal_ (lord), was supposed to be identical with the\r\nGrecian Heracles, or Hercules, who was the mythical ancestor of the\r\nMacedonian kings. _Curtius_ (iv. 7) tells us that Alexander affirmed\r\nhe had been ordered by an oracle to sacrifice in Tyre to Heracles.\r\nGesenius informs us that a Maltese inscription identifies the Tyrian\r\nMelkarth with Heracles.\r\n\r\n[299] Who was the son of Labdacus.\r\n\r\n[300] See _Herodotus_, ii. 43, 44.\r\n\r\n[301] The district comprising all the south-west of Spain outside the\r\npillars of Heracles, or Straits of Gibraltar, was called Tartessis,\r\nof which the chief city was Tartessus. Here the Phoenicians planted\r\ncolonies, one of which still remains under the name of Cadiz. The\r\nRomans called the district Baetica, from the principal river, the\r\nBaetis or Guadalquivir. The Hebrew name for this region is _Tarshish_,\r\nof which Tartessus is the Greek form. Tarshish was the station for the\r\nPhoenician trade with the West, which extended as far as Cornwall.\r\nThe Tyrians fetched from this locality silver, iron, lead, tin, and\r\ngold (Isa. xxiii. 1, 6, 10, lxvi. 19; Jer. x. 9; Ezek. xxvii. 12,\r\nxxxviii. 13). Martial, Seneca, and Avienus, the first two of whom were\r\nSpaniards, understood Tartessus to stand for the south-west of Spain\r\nand Portugal. The word Tarshish probably means _sea-coast_, from the\r\nSanscrit _tarischa_, the sea. Ovid (_Met._, xiv. 416); _Martial_, viii.\r\n28; _Silius_, xiii. 673.\r\n\r\n[302] Of Miletus. Herodotus knew his writings well, but they have not\r\ncome down to us. See _Herod._ (ii. 143; v. 36 and 125).\r\n\r\n[303] The Iberians were originally called Tibarenes, or Tibari. They\r\ndwelt on the east of the Black Sea, and west of Colchis, whence they\r\nemigrated to Spain. This nation is called _Tubal_ in the Hebrew Bible;\r\nin Isa. lxvi. 19 the Iberians of western Europe are referred to.\r\n\r\n[304] An island near Cadiz, now called Leon. Cf. Hesiod (_Theogonia_,\r\n287-294); _Herodotus_, iv. 8.\r\n\r\n[305] Now called Arta.\r\n\r\n[306] Arrian omits to mention that the Tyrians pointed out to him that\r\nhis wish to sacrifice to Hercules might be gratified without entering\r\ntheir city, since at Palaetyrus, on the mainland, separated from Tyre\r\nonly by a narrow strait, was a temple of that deity more ancient than\r\nthat in Tyre. See _Curtius_, iv. 7; _Justin_, xi. 10. We learn from\r\n_Arrian_, i. 18, that when Alexander offered sacrifice to the Ephesian\r\nDiana he marched to the temple with his whole army in battle array.\r\nNo doubt it was this kind of thing the Tyrians objected to. Alexander\r\nactually did the same at Tyre after its capture. (See chapter 24.)\r\n\r\n[307] For this use of ἐνύπνιον, cf. Homer (_Iliad_, ii. 56);\r\nAristophanes (_Wasps_, 1218).\r\n\r\n[308] Cf. _Arrian_, i. 11 and 25 supra.\r\n\r\n[309] The island was about half a mile from the mainland, and about a\r\nmile in length.\r\n\r\n[310] We learn from _Diodorus_ (xvii. 40) that the breadth of this mole\r\nwas about 200 feet.\r\n\r\n[311] _Curtius_ (iv. 10) says that the timber was procured from\r\nLebanon, and the stones from Old Tyre on the mainland.\r\n\r\n[312] Cf. _Polyaenus_ (iv. 3).\r\n\r\n[313] Cf. Cæsar (_Bell. Gall._, vii. 24)—reliquasque res, quibus ignis\r\nexcitari potest, fundebant. Krüger has unnecessarily altered ἐπὶ ταύτῃ\r\ninto ἐπ’ αὐτήν (_i.e._ πρῷραν).\r\n\r\n[314] _Curtius_ (iv. 12) says that the stern was loaded with stones and\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n[315] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 42) and _Curtius_ (iv. 12) say that a great\r\ntempest helped to demolish the palisade.\r\n\r\n[316] We learn from Josephus (_Antiquities of the Jews_, ix. 14), on\r\nthe authority of Menander, that when Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, four\r\ncenturies before Alexander’s time, besieged Tyre, the other Phoenicians\r\nsupplied him with ships in like manner.\r\n\r\n[317] This was a state vessel, or guardship, similar to the _Paralus_\r\nand _Salaminia_ at Athens. See _Alciphron_, Bk. I. Epistle 11, with\r\nBergler’s note.\r\n\r\n[318] See _Arrian_, ii. 2 supra.\r\n\r\n[319] _Curtius_ (iv. 11) says that about thirty of the Macedonians\r\ncollecting timber in Lebanon were killed by a party of wild Arabs,\r\nand that a few were also captured by them. _Lebanon_ is a Hebrew word\r\nmeaning _white_, like _Alpes_. It was so called on account of its white\r\ncliffs, just as Britain is called by Aristotle, _Albion_, the Celtic\r\nfor white.\r\n\r\n[320] Plutarch (_Life of Alexander_, 24) gives us, on the authority of\r\nChares, some details of daring valour on the part of Alexander in this\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n[321] Cleander was put to death by Alexander for oppression in\r\nexercising his duties as governor of Media. See _Arrian_, vi. 27 infra.\r\n\r\n[322] In regard to this manœuvre, see _Herodotus_, vi. 12;\r\n_Thucydides_, i. 49, with Arnold’s note.\r\n\r\n[323] συμπεπηγμέναι:—“In the best authors πέπηγα is used as the perf.\r\npass. of πήγνυμι” (_Liddell & Scott_). Cf. v. 12, 4; 24, 4, infra.\r\n\r\n[324] Cf. Plautus (_Mercator_, iv. 2, 5), _hortator remigum_.\r\n\r\n[325] Amathus was a town on the south coast of Cyprus. It is now called\r\nLimasol. Cf. _Herodotus_, v. 104-115; Tacitus (_Ann._, iii. 62); Vergil\r\n(_Aeneid_, x. 51).\r\n\r\n[326] Curium was also a town on the south coast of Cyprus.\r\n\r\n[327] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 45) says, that after Admetus was killed,\r\nAlexander recalled his men from the assault that night, but renewed it\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\n[328] Agenor, the father of Cadmus, was the reputed founder of Tyre and\r\nSidon. See _Curtius_, iv. 19.\r\n\r\n[329] The Tyrians had been encouraged in their resistance by the\r\npromise of aid from their colony Carthage. But the Carthaginians\r\nexcused themselves on the ground of their own difficulties in\r\ncontending with the Greeks. The Tyrians however despatched their women,\r\nchildren, and old men to Carthage for safety. See _Diodorus_, xvii. 40,\r\n41; _Curtius_, iv. 8 and 15. We learn from _Diod._, xx. 14, that the\r\nCarthaginians were in the habit of sending to the Tyrian Hercules the\r\ntenth of their revenues.\r\n\r\n[330] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 46) and _Curtius_ (iv. 19) state that 2,000\r\nTyrians who had escaped the massacre were hanged on the seashore by\r\nAlexander’s order.\r\n\r\n[331] The end of July and beginning of August B.C. 332. _Diodorus_\r\n(xvii. 46) tells us that the siege lasted seven months. See also\r\n_Curtius_ (iv. 20) and Plutarch (_Life of Alexander_, 24). We find from\r\n_Strabo_ (xvi. 2) that Tyre again became a flourishing city.\r\n\r\n[332] About £2,440,000.\r\n\r\n[333] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 54) puts the arrival of this embassy after\r\nAlexander’s conquest of Egypt. _Curtius_ (iv. 21) says that the name of\r\nthe daughter whom Darius offered to Alexander was Statira.\r\n\r\n[334] The term Palestine is derived from _Pĕlesheth_, the name given\r\nin Hebrew to the coast district in the south-west of Palestine, the\r\ninhabitants of which were called _Pĕlishtim_, or Philistines. As this\r\ntract of country lay directly between Phoenicia and Egypt, it became\r\nknown to the Greeks sooner than the rest of the Holy Land, and they\r\ncalled it Syria Palaestinē. The name was gradually extended until\r\nit became the usual one for all the Holy Land among Greek and Latin\r\nwriters. An interesting account of Alexander’s visit to Jerusalem and\r\nhis dealings with the Jews is found in Josephus (_Antiquities_, xi. 8).\r\n\r\n[335] Nearly two miles and a half. _Strabo_ (xvi. 2) says that the city\r\nwas only seven stades from the sea.\r\n\r\n[336] Gaza is the Greek form of the Hebrew name _Azzah_ (fortress). Its\r\nposition on the border of Egypt and Palestine has given it importance\r\nfrom the earliest times. It was one of the five cities of the\r\nPhilistines; and retained its own king till a late period, as we learn\r\nfrom Zechariah ix. 5. It was the scene of a battle between Richard I.\r\nand the Saracens. It is now called Guzzeh, with a population of 15,000.\r\n\r\n[337] Compare _Arrian_, i. 11 and 25; ii. 18. Plutarch (_Alex._, 25)\r\nsays that the bird was entangled and caught among the nets and cords.\r\nSee also _Curtius_, iv. 26.\r\n\r\n[338] A stadium equalled 606-3/4 feet.\r\n\r\n[339] Cf. _Thucydides_, ii. 76 (description of the siege of Plataeae).\r\n\r\n[340] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 48) says that the siege of Gaza lasted two\r\nmonths. _Polybius_ (xvi. 40) speaks of the resolution and valour of\r\nthe Gazaeans. We learn from _Curtius_ (iv. 28) and from _Dionysius_ of\r\nHalicarnassus (_De Compositione Verborum_, pp. 123-125) that Alexander\r\ntreated the brave Batis with horrible cruelty. He ordered his feet to\r\nbe bored and brazen rings to be put through them, after which the naked\r\nbody was tied to the back of a chariot which was driven by Alexander\r\nhimself round the city, in imitation of the treatment of Hector by\r\nAchilles at Troy. Cf. _Arrian_, vii. 14. Dionysius quotes from Hegesias\r\nof Magnesia, who wrote a history of Alexander, not now extant. Curtius\r\nsays that nearly 10,000 of the Persians and Arabs were slain at Gaza.\r\n_Strabo_ (xvi. 2) says that in his time (_i.e._ in the reign of\r\nAugustus) the city still remained desolate, as it was left by Alexander.\r\n\r\n[341] Pelusium is identical with the Hebrew _Sin_ (a marsh) the most\r\neasterly city of Egypt, which is called in Ezekiel xxx. 15, the\r\n_strength of Egypt_, because it was the key to that country from its\r\nfrontier position. Cf. _Herodotus_, iii. 5. _Strabo_ (xvii. 1) says\r\nit was situated near marshes. It stood east of the Pelusiac branch of\r\nthe Nile, about 2-1/2 miles from the sea. This mouth of the river was\r\nchoked up with sand as early as the first century of the Christian era\r\n(_Lucan_, viii. 465). Sennacherib advanced as far as this city, and\r\nhere Cambyses defeated the Egyptians, B.C. 525. Iphicrates the Athenian\r\nadvanced to Pelusium with the satrap Pharnabazus, B.C. 373. Cf. Vergil\r\n(_Georgic_, i. 228); _Martial_, xiii. 9; _Silius_, iii. 375.\r\n\r\n[342] _Curtius_ (iv. 22) says that this fleet was under the command of\r\nHephaestion.\r\n\r\n[343] His predecessor, Sabaces, was slain at Issus. See _Arrian_, ii.\r\n11 supra.\r\n\r\n[344] _Curtius_ (iv. 29) says that Mazaces surrendered to Alexander\r\ntreasure to the amount of 800 talents, nearly £200,000.\r\n\r\n[345] Memphis, the capital of Egypt, is called in the Hebrew Bible,\r\n_Noph_. In Hosea ix. 6 it is called _Moph_. The Egyptian name was\r\n_Mĕnoph_, of which both Moph and Noph are contractions. The name\r\nsignifies _place of Ftah_, the Egyptian name for Vulcan. Memphis\r\nstood on the west bank of the Nile, and is said by _Herodotus_ (ii.\r\n99) to have been founded by Menes. It had a circumference of fifteen\r\nmiles. Its numerous temples were famous and are mentioned in the poems\r\nof Martial, Ovid, and Tibullus. It never recovered the devastation\r\ncommitted by Cambyses, who was exasperated by its resistance. The rise\r\nof Alexandria as the capital under the Ptolemies, hastened the decline\r\nof Memphis. At Gizeh, near Memphis, are the three great pyramids, being\r\nof the height respectively of 460, 446, and 203 feet. Not far off are\r\nsix smaller ones. Near the second pyramid is the Sphinx, cut out of the\r\nsolid rock, which was probably an object of worship. Cf. _Apollodorus_,\r\nii. 4.\r\n\r\n[346] Heliopolis is known in Hebrew as _On_, which is an Egyptian\r\nword meaning _Sun_. It is mentioned in Gen. xli. 45, 50; xlvi. 20.\r\nIn Ezek. xxx. 17, it is called _Aven_, which is the same word in\r\nHebrew as On, with a variation of the vowels. In Jer. xliii. 13 it\r\nis called _Beith-Shemesh_, which in Hebrew means _House of the Sun_,\r\na translation of the Egyptian name. The Greeks called it Heliopolis,\r\n_City of the Sun_. The great temple of the Sun and its priesthood\r\nare described by Herodotus and Strabo. There are still remaining\r\na beautiful obelisk of red granite nearly 70 feet high, and the\r\nbrick wall of the temple 3,750 feet long by 2,370 feet broad. Cf.\r\n_Apollodorus_, ii. 4.\r\n\r\n[347] The word Nile never occurs in the Hebrew Bible; but that river is\r\ncalled _Yeor_ (river). In Amos viii. 8 it is called _Yeor Mitsraim_,\r\nthe river of Egypt; but it is usually called simply _Yeor_, the river.\r\nIn Isa. xxiii. 3 the corn of Egypt is called the _harvest of Yeor_, or\r\nthe Nile. In like manner Avon, Ganges, Rhine, mean _river_. The Greek\r\nname _Neilos_, or Nile, means a _bed with a stream_, and was originally\r\napplied to the land of Egypt, as the valley of the Nile. It rises in\r\nthe lake Victoria Nyanza, and has a course of 3,300 miles. In Isa.\r\nxxiii. 3 and Jer. ii. 18 the Nile is called _Shichor_ (turbid). In\r\nHomer (_Odys._, iv. 477, etc.) the river is called Egypt as well as the\r\ncountry. Cf. _Ammianus_, xxii. 15.\r\n\r\n[348] The Bull of Memphis, sacred to _Ftah_, the god of fire. See\r\n_Herodotus_, iii. 27, 28; _Strabo_, xvii. 1; _Ammianus_, xxii. 14; Ovid\r\n(_Met._, ix. 690).\r\n\r\n[349] Now Aboukir, about 13 miles north-east of Alexandria, near the\r\nwesternmost mouth of the Nile. Cf. Aeschўlus (_Supp._, 311; _Prom._,\r\n846); _Strabo_, xvii. 1, 17; Tacitus (_Ann._, ii. 60).\r\n\r\n[350] Usually called Lake Mareotis, now Mariût. Cf. Vergil (_Georgic_,\r\nii. 91).\r\n\r\n[351] We learn, from _Curtius_ (iv. 33), that Alexander at first\r\nresolved to build the city on the island of Pharos, but finding it too\r\nsmall, built it on the mainland.\r\n\r\n[352] A goddess representing the moon, and wife of Osiris the sun-god.\r\n\r\n[353] Cf. _Strabo_ (xvii. 1); Plutarch (_Alex._, 26); _Diodorus_ (xvii.\r\n52); _Curtius_ (iv. 33); _Ammianus_ (xxii. 16).\r\n\r\n[354] We find from _Valerius Maximus_ (i. 4) and _Ammianus_, l.c.,\r\nthat his name was Dinocrates.\r\n\r\n[355] Krüger substitutes ἐπενόει for ἐποίει, comparing iv. 1, 3, and 4,\r\n1 infra.\r\n\r\n[356] See _Arrian_, ii. 2 supra.\r\n\r\n[357] Methymna was, next to Mitylene, the most important city in Lesbos.\r\n\r\n[358] Chares was an Athenian who had been one of the generals at the\r\nfatal battle of Chaeronea. _Curtius_ (iv. 24) says that he consented to\r\nevacuate Mitylene with his force of 2,000 men on condition of a free\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n[359] On an island in the Nile, of the same name, opposite Syene. It\r\nserved as the southern frontier garrison station.\r\n\r\n[360] The temple of Jupiter Ammon was in the oasis of Siwah, to the\r\nWest of Egypt. Its ruins were discovered by Browne in 1792. This oasis\r\nis about 6 miles long and 3 broad. The people called Libyans occupied\r\nthe whole of North Africa excluding Egypt. In Hebrew they are called\r\n_Lubim_ (sunburnt). See 2 Chron. xii. 3; xvi. 8; Dan. xi. 43; Nah. iii.\r\n9. Cf. _Herodotus_, ii. 32; iv. 168-199.\r\n\r\n[361] King of the island Seriphus. Cf. _Herodotus_, ii. 91.\r\n\r\n[362] The gigantic son of Poseidon and Ge.\r\n\r\n[363] King of Egypt, who was said to have sacrificed all foreigners\r\nthat visited the land.\r\n\r\n[364] Perseus was the grandfather of Alemena, the mother of Hercules.\r\n\r\n[365] About 183 miles. This city lay at the extreme west of Egypt, in\r\nMarmarica.\r\n\r\n[366] “For some distance onward the engineers had erected a line of\r\ntelegraph poles to guide us, but after they ceased the desert was\r\nabsolutely trackless. Our guides were the stars—had the night been\r\novercast the enterprise would have been impossible—and we were steered\r\nby a naval officer, Lieutenant Rawson, who had doubtless studied on\r\nprevious nights the relation of these celestial beacons to the course\r\nof our march. The centre of the line was the point of direction;\r\ntherefore he rode between the centre battalions (75th and 79th) of the\r\nHighland Brigade. Frequently in the course of the night, after duly\r\nascertaining what dark figure I was addressing, I represented to him\r\nthat his particular star was clouded over; but he always replied that\r\nhe had another in view, a second string to his bow, which he showed\r\nme, and that he was convinced he had not deviated in the least from\r\nthe proper direction. And he was right, his guidance was marvellously\r\ncorrect; for his reward, poor fellow, he was shot down in the assault,\r\nmortally wounded. Here we were adrift, but for the stars, in a region\r\nwhere no token existed on the surface by which to mark the course—any\r\nmore than on the ocean without a compass—and the distance to be\r\ntraversed was many miles.”—Sir Edward Hamley: “The Second Division at\r\nTel-el-Kebir,” _Nineteenth Century_, December, 1882.\r\n\r\n[367] _Strabo_ (xvii. 1) quotes from Callisthenes, whose work on\r\nAlexander is lost. He agrees with Aristobulus about the two ravens.\r\nCallisthenes is also quoted by Plutarch (_Alex._, 27) in regard to this\r\nprodigy. _Curtius_ (iv. 30) says that there were _several ravens_; and\r\n_Diodorus_ (xvii. 49) speaks of _ravens_.\r\n\r\n[368] Nearly five miles. Cf. _Lucan_, ix. 511-543.\r\n\r\n[369] This _Fountain of the Sun_, as it is called, is 30 paces long\r\nand 20 broad; 6 fathoms deep, with bubbles constantly rising from the\r\nsurface. Cf. _Herodotus_, iv. 181; _Lucretius_, vi. 849-878; _Ptolemy_,\r\niv. 5, 37.\r\n\r\n[370] This is what we call sal ammoniac, known to chemists as\r\nhydrochlorate of ammonia. The _dactylos_ was the smallest Greek measure\r\nof length, about 7/10 of an inch.\r\n\r\n[371] We learn from _Strabo_ (xvii. 1), on the authority of\r\nCallisthenes, that the declaration of the oracle of Ammon was confirmed\r\nby those of Apollo at Branchidae near Miletus, and of Athena at\r\nErythrae in Ionia. Plutarch (_Alex._, 28) and _Arrian_ (vii. 29) assert\r\nthat Alexander set afloat the declaration that he was the son of Zeus\r\nto overawe the foreigners over whom he was extending his rule.\r\n\r\n[372] Ewald and others think that Heroöpolis was identical with the\r\nRaamses of the Bible. Raamses, or Rameses, is a Coptic word meaning\r\n“the son of the sun.”\r\n\r\n[373] A city founded by the Milesians on the Canopic branch of the\r\nNile. It remained a purely Greek city, being the only place where\r\nGreeks were allowed to settle and trade in Egypt. Cf. _Herodotus_, ii.\r\n97, 135, 178, 179.\r\n\r\n[374] Cf. Tacitus (_Historiae_, i. 11).\r\n\r\n[375] We learn, from _Curtius_ (iv. 34), that Alexander went to Samaria\r\nto chastise the inhabitants, who had burnt his deputy, Andromachus, to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[376] From early times the Athenians kept two sacred vessels for state\r\npurposes, the one called the _Paralus_ and the other _Salaminia_. In\r\nthe earliest times the former was used for coasting purposes, and the\r\nlatter for the journey to Salamis. Hence their respective names. See\r\nDr. Smith’s _Dict. of Antiquities_. Aeschines, in his oration against\r\nCtesiphon (p. 550), asserts that he was informed by the seamen of the\r\n_Paralus_ that Demosthenes on this occasion sent a letter to Alexander\r\nsoliciting pardon and favour.\r\n\r\n[377] Cf. Aelian, _Varia Historia_, i. 25; _Curtius_, iv. 34.\r\n\r\n[378] Beroea was a city of Macedonia, on the Astraeus, a tributary of\r\nthe Haliacmon, about 20 miles from the sea.\r\n\r\n[379] Other historians call this queen Cleopatra. She was the daughter\r\nof a Macedonian named Attalus. Plutarch (_Alex._, 9 and 10) says that\r\nshe was cruelly put to death by Olympias during Alexander’s absence.\r\n_Justin_ (ix. 7; xi. 2) states that Olympias first slew her daughter on\r\nher mother’s bosom and then had Cleopatra hanged; while Alexander put\r\nto death Caranus, the infant son of Philip and Cleopatra. _Pausanias_\r\n(viii. 7) says that Olympias caused Cleopatra and her infant son to be\r\nroasted on a brazen vessel. Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xiii. 35).\r\n\r\n[380] This king was brother of Alexander’s mother Olympias, and husband\r\nof Cleopatra the daughter of Philip and Olympias. He crossed over into\r\nItaly to aid the Tarentines against the Lucanians and Bruttians, but\r\nwas eventually defeated and slain near Pandosia, B.C. 326.\r\n\r\n[381] June-July, B.C. 331.\r\n\r\n[382] We learn, from _Curtius_ (iv. 37), that Alexander took eleven\r\ndays to march from Phoenicia to the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n[383] _Curtius_ (iv. 37) says that Tigris is the Persian word for\r\n_arrow_; and that the river was so named on account of the swiftness\r\nof its current. The Hebrew name is Chiddekel, which means _arrow_.\r\nSee Gen. ii. 14; and Dan. x. 4, where it is called _the great river_.\r\nThe name Tigris is derived from the Zend _Tighra_, which comes from\r\nthe Sanscrit _Tig_, to sharpen. It is now called Dijleh. It joins\r\nthe Euphrates 90 miles from the sea, and the united stream is called\r\nShat-el-Arab. Its entire length is 1,146 miles. In ancient times the\r\ntwo rivers had distinct mouths. So the Rhon formerly had several\r\nmouths. See _Livy_, xxi. 26. _Strabo_ (iv. 1, 8) says that Timaeus gave\r\nit five mouths; Polybius gives it two; others give seven.\r\n\r\n[384] This eclipse occurred September 20th, B.C. 331.\r\n\r\n[385] The part of Assyria lying between the Upper Tigris and the Lycus\r\nwas called Aturia.\r\n\r\n[386] Called Carduchi by Xenophon. These mountains separate Assyria and\r\nMesopotamia from Media and Armenia.\r\n\r\n[387] Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xii. 38).\r\n\r\n[388] Arachosia comprised what is now the south-east part of\r\nAfghanistan and the north-east part of Beloochistan.\r\n\r\n[389] Aria comprised the west and north-west part of Afghanistan and\r\nthe east part of Khorasan.\r\n\r\n[390] Parthia is the modern Khorasan. Hyrcania was the country south\r\nand south-east of the Caspian Sea. The Tapurians dwelt in the north\r\nof Media, on the borders of Parthia between the Caspian passes. Cf.\r\n_Ammianus_, xxiii. 6.\r\n\r\n[391] The Cadusians lived south-west of the Caspian, the Albanians on\r\nthe west of the same sea, in the south-east part of Georgia, and the\r\nSacesinians in the north-east of Armenia, on the river Kur.\r\n\r\n[392] The Red Sea was the name originally given to the whole expanse of\r\nsea to the west of India as far as Africa. The name was subsequently\r\ngiven to the Arabian Gulf exclusively. In Hebrew it is called\r\n_Yam-Suph_ (Sea of Sedge, or a seaweed resembling wool). The Egyptians\r\ncalled it the Sea of Weeds.\r\n\r\n[393] The Uxians occupied the north-west of Persis, and Susiana was the\r\ncountry to the north and west of Persis.\r\n\r\n[394] The Sitacenians lived in the south of Assyria. ἐτετάχατο\r\nis the Ionic form for τεταγμένοι ἦσαν.\r\n\r\n[395] The Greeks called this country Mesopotamia because it lies\r\nbetween the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. In the Bible it is called\r\nPaddan-Aram (the plain of _Aram_, which is the Hebrew name of Syria).\r\nIn Gen. xlviii. 7 it is called merely _Paddan_, the plain. In Hos.\r\nxii. 12, it is called the _field of Aram_, or, as our Bible has\r\nit, the _country of Syria_. Elsewhere in the Bible it is called\r\n_Aram-naharaim_, Aram of the two rivers, which the Greeks translated\r\nMesopotamia. It is called “_the Island_,” by Arabian geographers.\r\n\r\n[396] _Curtius_ (iv. 35 and 45) states that Darius had 200,000\r\ninfantry, 45,000 cavalry, and 200 scythed chariots; _Diodorus_ (xvii.\r\n53) says, 800,000 infantry, 200,000 cavalry, and 200 scythed chariots;\r\n_Justin_ (xi. 12) gives 400,000 foot and 100,000 horse; and Plutarch\r\n(_Alex._, 31) speaks of a million of men. For the chariots cf. Xenophon\r\n(_Anab._, i. 8, 10); _Livy_, xxxvii. 41.\r\n\r\n[397] This is the first instance on record of the employment of\r\nelephants in battle.\r\n\r\n[398] This river is now called Ghasir, a tributary of the Great Zab.\r\nThe village Gaugamela was in the district of Assyria called Aturia,\r\nabout 69 miles from the city of Arbela, now called Erbil.\r\n\r\n[399] About 7 miles.\r\n\r\n[400] Xenophon (_Anab._, iii. 4, 35) explains why this was so.\r\n\r\n[401] σφεῖς here stands for αὐτοί.\r\n\r\n[402] See note 252 to ii. 10 supra.\r\n\r\n[403] These people were a Scythian tribe leading a nomadic life east\r\nof the Caspian. They are called Daoi by _Herodotus_, i. 125; Dahae\r\nby _Ammianus_, xxii. 8, 21; _Livy_, xxxv. 48; xxxvii. 38; Vergil\r\n(_Aeneid_, viii. 728); _Pliny_, vi. 19; _Strabo_, xi. 7. They are\r\nmentioned in Ezra iv. 9 as subjects of Persia. The district is now\r\ncalled Daikh. See Fürst’s _Hebrew Lexicon_, sub voce דֶּֽה.\r\n\r\n[404] A title of honour. Curtius says that they numbered 15,000.\r\n\r\n[405] Cf. _Herodotus_, vii. 41.\r\n\r\n[406] This people lived to the south of the Caspian.\r\n\r\n[407] “Several names of various contingents stated to have been present\r\nin the field are not placed in the official return—thus the Sogdiani,\r\nthe Arians, and the Indian mountaineers are mentioned by _Arrian_ as\r\nhaving joined Darius (iii. 8); the Kossaeans by _Diodorus_ (xvii. 59);\r\nthe Sogdiani, Massagatae, Belitae, Kossaeans, Gortyae, Phrygians, and\r\nKataonians, by _Curtius_ (iv. 12).”—_Grote_.\r\n\r\n[408] This distinguished general succeeded Antipater as regent of\r\nMacedonia, but was overcome by Cassander, the son of the former, and\r\nbecame subordinate to him.\r\n\r\n[409] There were thus six taxeis, or brigades of foot Companions, as\r\nthey were called, in the phalanx of infantry at the battle of Arbela.\r\nArrian’s description of the battle at the Granicus (i. 14) seems to\r\nbe erroneous in some of the words of the text; yet it may be gathered\r\nfrom it that there were also six taxeis in Alexander’s phalanx on that\r\noccasion also.\r\n\r\n[410] See Arrian’s _Tactics_, 29.\r\n\r\n[411] Cf. _Diodorus_ (xvii. 57).\r\n\r\n[412] See Donaldson’s _New Cratylus_, sect. 178.\r\n\r\n[413] Cf. _Curtius_, iv. 35. “Equitibus equisque tegumenta erant ex\r\nferreis laminis serie inter se connexis.”\r\n\r\n[414] Compare the uselessness of the Persian scythed chariots at the\r\nbattle of Cunaxa. See Xenophon (_Anabasis_, i. 8). So also at the\r\nbattle of Magnesia between Scipio and Antiochus. See _Livy_, xxxvii. 41.\r\n\r\n[415] πεφρικυῖα, imitated from Homer (_Iliad_, iv.\r\n282). Cf. Vergil (_Aeneid_, x. 178, _horrentibus hastis_); _Livy_,\r\nxliv. 41 (_horrendis hastis_).\r\n\r\n[416] _Curtius_ (iv. 58, 59) and _Diodorus_ (xvii. 60) describe quite\r\nan Homeric battle, Darius hurling a spear at Alexander, and Alexander\r\nhurling his at Darius and killing his charioteer. They say that the\r\nPersians mistook the fall of the Charioteer for that of the king, and\r\nfled, carrying Darius with them.\r\n\r\n[417] _Curtius_ (iv. 59) and _Diodorus_ (xvii. 60) say that so thick a\r\ncloud of dust was raised by the mighty mass of fugitives, that nothing\r\ncould be clearly distinguished, and that thus the Macedonians lost the\r\ntrack of Darius. The noise of the shouting and the cracking of whips\r\nserved as guides to the pursuers.\r\n\r\n[418] Sisygambis, the mother of Darius, whom these Persians were\r\nespecially anxious to liberate from the custody of the Macedonians,\r\nrefused to go with them. See _Diodorus_ and _Curtius_.\r\n\r\n[419] Arrian does not say much about this vigorous charge of Mazaeus,\r\nthe commander of the Persian right wing. See _Curtius_ (iv. 60);\r\n_Diodorus_ (xvii. 60).\r\n\r\n[420] We learn from _Diodorus_ and _Curtius_ that Parmenio had driven\r\nMazaeus back before Alexander’s arrival.\r\n\r\n[421] The Lycus, now called the Great Zab, is a tributary of the\r\nTigris. Xenophon calls it Zabatus (_Anab._, ii. 5). The Greek _Lycus_\r\nis a translation of the Syrian _Zaba_ (wolf).\r\n\r\n[422] About sixty-nine miles. Cf. _Strabo_ (xvi. 1, 3).\r\n\r\n[423] ἐλινύσας. This is an Ionic word used by _Herodotus_ (viii. 71,\r\netc.), and rarely in Attic poets and later prose writers.\r\n\r\n[424] See _Arrian_, ii. 11 supra.\r\n\r\n[425] _Curtius_ (iv. 63) says that 40,000 of the Persians were slain,\r\nand that less than 300 Macedonians were killed. _Diodorus_ (xvii. 61)\r\nstates that more than 90,000 Persians and 500 Macedonians were slain.\r\n\r\n[426] September 331 B.C. Cf. Plutarch (_Alex._, 31).\r\n\r\n[427] For this prediction, see iii. 7 supra.\r\n\r\n[428] As to the kinsmen and apple-bearers, see iii. 11 supra.\r\n\r\n[429] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 63) and _Curtius_ (v. 6) state that from the\r\ntreasure captured in Babylon, Alexander distributed to each Macedonian\r\nhorseman about £24, to each of the Grecian horsemen £20, to each of the\r\nMacedonian infantry £8, and to the allied infantry two months’ pay.\r\n\r\n[430] Belus, or Bel, the supreme deity of the Babylonians, was\r\nidentical with the Syrian Baal. The signification of the name is\r\n_mighty_. Cf. _Herodotus_ (i. 181); _Diodorus_ (ii. 9); _Strabo_ (xvi.\r\n1).\r\n\r\n[431] See i. 17 supra.\r\n\r\n[432] The Chaldees appear in Hebrew under the name of _Casdim_, who\r\nseem to have originally dwelt in Carduchia, the northern part of\r\nAssyria. The Assyrians transported these rude mountaineers to the\r\nplains of Babylonia (Isa. xxiii. 13). The name of Casdim, or Chaldees,\r\nwas applied to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia (Gen. xi. 28); the\r\ninhabitants of the Arabian desert in the vicinity of Edom (Job i. 17);\r\nthose who dwelt near the river Chaboras (Ezek. i. 3; xi. 24); and the\r\npriestly caste who had settled at a very early period in Babylon, as\r\nwe are informed by Diodorus and Eusebius. Herodotus says that these\r\npriests were dedicated to Belus. It is proved by inscriptions that the\r\nancient language was retained as a learned and religious literature.\r\nThis is probably what is meant in Daniel i. 4 by “the book and tongue\r\nof the Casdim.” Cf. _Diodorus_ (ii. 29-31); _Ptolemy_ (v. 20, 3); and\r\nCicero (_De Divinatione_, i. 1). See Fürst’s _Hebrew Lexicon_, sub voce\r\nכֶּֽשֶׂד.\r\n\r\n[433] In the Bible this city is called Shushan. Near it was the\r\nfortress of Shushan, called in our Bible _the Palace_ (Neh. i. 2; Esth.\r\nii. 8). Susa was situated on the Choaspes, a river remarkable for the\r\nexcellence of its water, a fact referred to by _Tibullus_ (iv. 1, 140)\r\nand by Milton (_Paradise Reg._, iii. 288). The name Shushan is derived\r\nfrom the Persian word for lily, which grew abundantly in the vicinity.\r\nThe ruins of the palace mentioned in Esther i. have recently been\r\nexplored, and were found to consist of an immense hall, the roof of\r\nwhich was supported by a central group of thirty-six pillars arranged\r\nin the form of a square. This was flanked by three porticoes, each\r\ncontaining two rows of six pillars. Cf. _Strabo_ (xv. 7, 28).\r\n\r\n[434] The name of the viceroy was Abulites (_Curtius_, v. 8).\r\n\r\n[435] If these were Attic talents, the amount would be equivalent to\r\n£11,600,000; but if they were Babylonian or Aeginetan talents, they\r\nwere equal to £19,000,000. Cf. Plutarch (_Alex._, 36, 37); _Justin_\r\n(xi. 14); and _Curtius_ (v. 8). _Diodorus_ (xvii. 66) tells us that\r\n40,000 talents were of uncoined gold and silver, and 9,000 talents of\r\ngold bearing the effigy of Darius.\r\n\r\n[436] Cf. _Arrian_ (vii. 19); _Pausanias_ (i. 8, 5); Pliny (_Nat.\r\nHist._, xxxiv. 9); _Valerius Maximus_ (ii. 10, 1). For Harmodius and\r\nAristogeiton see _Thucydides_, vi. 56-58.\r\n\r\n[437] Polis meant in early times a particular part of Athens, viz. the\r\ncitadel, usually called the Acropolis. Cf. Aristophanes (_Lysistrata_,\r\n245 et passim).\r\n\r\n[438] Demeter and Persephone.\r\n\r\n[439] About £730,000.\r\n\r\n[440] Antipater had been left by Alexander regent of Macedonia. Agis\r\nIII., king of Sparta, refused to acknowledge Alexander’s hegemony,\r\nand after a hard struggle was defeated and slain by Antipater at\r\nMegalopolis, B.C. 330. See _Diodorus_, xvii. 63; _Curtius_, vi. 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n[441] According to _Curtius_ (v. 6) these forces amounted to nearly\r\n15,000 men. Amyntas also brought with him fifty sons of the chief men\r\nin Macedonia, who wished to serve as royal pages. Cf. _Diodorus_, xvii.\r\n64.\r\n\r\n[442] A river flowing through Susiana, formed by the junction of the\r\nEulaeus and Coprates.\r\n\r\n[443] Cf. _Strabo_, xv. 3.\r\n\r\n[444] πλεονεκτούμενοι, with dative, defrauded of. Cf. _Demosthenes_,\r\n1035, 26.\r\n\r\n[445] γέρα. An Homeric expression.\r\n\r\n[446] Named Sisygambis (_Curtius_, v. 11).\r\n\r\n[447] This was the Araxes. See _Strabo_, xv. 3.\r\n\r\n[448] Notice the use of the adverb πρίν with the\r\ngenitive, instead of the preposition πρό. Cf. Pindar\r\n(_Pythia_, iv. 76) πρὶν ὥρας.\r\n\r\n[449] _Curtius_ (v. 16) says that Ariobarzanes after a bloody contest\r\ngot away through the Macedonian lines, with about 40 horsemen and 5,000\r\nfoot, and made for Persepolis. Being shut out of that fortress, he was\r\novertaken and slain with all his companions. Cf. _Diodorus_ (xvii. 68).\r\n\r\n[450] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 69) and _Justin_ (xi. 14) state that on\r\napproaching Persepolis, Alexander met 800 Grecian captives, mutilated\r\nby loss of arms, legs, eyes, ears, or other members. _Curtius_ (v.\r\n17-19) says there were 4,000 of them. Alexander offered to send these\r\nmen home, with means of future support; but they preferred to remain in\r\nPersis. The king gave them money, clothing, cattle, and land.\r\n\r\n[451] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 71) and _Curtius_ (v. 20) both state that\r\nthe amount of treasure captured at Persepolis was 120,000 talents,\r\nor £27,600,000. In his own letter Alexander stated that there was\r\nsufficient treasure and valuable property to load 10,000 mule carts\r\nand 5,000 camels (Plutarch, _Alex._, 37). Curtius tells us that 6,000\r\ntalents were captured at Pasargadae.\r\n\r\n[452] Pasargadae was the old capital of Persia, founded by Cyrus; but\r\nits place was afterwards taken by Persepolis.\r\n\r\n[453] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 70, 71) and _Curtius_ (v. 20, 22) say that\r\nAlexander delivered Persepolis to his soldiers to pillage, and that\r\nhe ordered a general massacre of the inhabitants. These authors agree\r\nwith Plutarch (_Alex._, 38) in asserting that in a drunken revel he\r\nwas instigated by the courtesan Thais to set fire to the palace, and\r\naccompanied her to commence the act of destruction. See _Dryden’s_\r\nfamous ode. But Arrian’s account establishes the fact that the fire was\r\nthe result of a deliberate plan. As regards the massacre, _Plutarch_\r\n(37) expressly states that Alexander wrote home that he ordered it from\r\nmotives of policy.\r\n\r\n[454] This was the principal pass through the Elburz mountains from\r\nMedia into Hyrcania and Parthia.\r\n\r\n[455] This was the capital of Media, called in Chaldee _Achmetha_\r\n(Ezra vi. 2). The present city of Hamadan is on the same site. It is\r\nsituated at the foot of Mount Orontes, and was used by the Persian and\r\nParthian kings as their summer residence. It was surrounded by seven\r\nwalls, each overtopping the one before it, from the outer to the inner,\r\ncrowned with battlements of different colours. Its citadel was used as\r\na royal treasury. Below it stood a splendid palace, with silver tiles,\r\nand adorned with wainscotings, capitals, and entablatures of gold and\r\nsilver. These treasures, to the value of 4,000 talents, were coined\r\ninto money by Antiochus the Great of Syria. See _Herodotus_, i. 98;\r\n_Polybius_, x. 27.\r\n\r\n[456] This tribe lived in the mountains between Media and Persia.\r\n\r\n[457] £1,700,000.\r\n\r\n[458] _Curtius_ (v. 23) says that 6,000 Grecian mercenaries under Plato\r\nthe Athenian met Alexander in Media, having marched up from Cilicia.\r\n\r\n[459] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 80) says that the amount of treasure deposited\r\nat Ecbatana was 180,000 talents or £41,400,000.\r\n\r\n[460] A large city in the extreme north of Media, mentioned in the Book\r\nof Tobit. It was famous in the Middle Ages under the name of Rai. The\r\nruins of Rai lie south-east of Teheran.\r\n\r\n[461] ἔστε generally means _until_. In its present use cf. ii. 11\r\nsupra, ἔστε μὲν φάος ἦν.\r\n\r\n[462] The Drangians lived in a part of Ariana west of Arachosia.\r\n\r\n[463] _Justin_ (xi. 15) and _Curtius_ (v. 34) state that Darius was\r\nbound in chains of gold. The former says that the name of the place was\r\nThara in Parthia, where the king was arrested. Probably these chains\r\nwere those worn by the king or his nobles, according to the Persian\r\ncustom. This is the only sentence in Arrian where περὶ\r\nsuffers anastrophe, coming after the noun.\r\n\r\n[464] Plutarch (_Alex._, 42) says that Alexander rode 3,300 stades, or\r\nabout 400 miles, in eleven days. In the next chapter he says that only\r\nsixty of his men were able to keep up with him in the pursuit.\r\n\r\n[465] _Curtius_ (v. 24-38) gives very ample details of what occurred\r\nduring the last days of Darius. Cf. _Diodorus_ (xvii. 73); _Justin_\r\n(xi. 15).\r\n\r\n[466] The Persian kings were buried at Persepolis. See _Diodorus_,\r\nxvii. 71. Plutarch (_Alex._, 43) says that Alexander sent the corpse of\r\nDarius to his mother.\r\n\r\n[467] In the year B.C. 330, the first of Hecatombaion fell on the first\r\nof July.\r\n\r\n[468] Darius came to the throne B.C. 336.\r\n\r\n[469] In 2 Kings xi. 4, 19 the word translated _captains_ in our\r\nBible is _Carim_, the Carians. These men formed the body-guard of the\r\nusurper Athaliah, who stood in need of foreign mercenaries. David had a\r\nbody-guard of Philistines and Cretans. The Carians served as mercenaries\r\nthroughout the ancient world, as we learn from _Thucydides_, i.\r\n8; _Herodotus_, i. 171; ii. 152; v. 111; _Strabo_, xiv. 2. The\r\nLydians appear in the Bible under the name of _Lud_ (Isa. lxvi. 19).\r\n_Herodotus_ (i. 94) gives an account of the colonization of Umbria by\r\nthe Lydians, from which sprung the state of the Etruscans. Hence Vergil\r\n(_Aeneid_, ii. 782) speaks of the “_Lydius Tybris_.” See also _Aeneid_,\r\nviii. 479; Horace (_Satires_, i. 6, 1); Tacitus (_Annals_, iv. 55);\r\nDionysius (_Archaeologia Romana_, i. 28).\r\n\r\n[470] He married Barsine, eldest daughter of Darius (_Arrian_, vii. 4\r\ninfra). She was also called Arsinoe and Stateira.\r\n\r\n[471] According to _Curtius_ (vi. 6-10) the soldiers were very desirous\r\nof returning home; but Alexander made an harangue and induced them to\r\nadvance into Hyrcania.\r\n\r\n[472] The modern Balkh.\r\n\r\n[473] The Caspian.\r\n\r\n[474] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 75) calls this river Stiboetis; _Curtius_ (vi.\r\n10) calls it Ziobetis.\r\n\r\n[475] _Krüger_ has ἐνταῦθα instead of τούτῳ.\r\n\r\n[476] _Curtius_ (vi. 14) says Artabazus had nine sons, one of whom,\r\nPharnabazus, was the admiral of the Persian fleet. See _Arrian_ (ii. 1;\r\nii. 2; iii. 2 supra).\r\n\r\n[477] Cf. _Curtius_, vi. 16.\r\n\r\n[478] Sinope was a prosperous colony of Miletus on the Euxine. It is\r\nstill called Sinoub. It was the birthplace of Diogenes.\r\n\r\n[479] Chalcedon was a colony of Megara, situated on the Propontis at\r\nthe entrance of the Bosporus, nearly opposite Byzantium.\r\n\r\n[480] Areia occupied what is now the east part of Khorasan, and the\r\nwest and north-west of Afghanistan. Susia is the modern Tus.\r\n\r\n[481] Compare the words of Tissaphernes to Clearchus (Xenophon,\r\n_Anabasis_, ii. 5): “Though the king is the only man who can wear the\r\ntiara erect upon his head, I shall be able to wear mine erect upon my\r\nheart in full confidence, when you are in my service.” Cf. _Curtius_\r\n(iii. 8); Aristophanes (_Birds_, 487). The cap of the ordinary\r\nPersians was low, loose, and clinging about the head in folds; whereas\r\nthat of the king was high and erect above the head. From Xenophon\r\n(_Cyropaedia_, viii. 3, 13) we learn that the Persian king’s vest was\r\nof a purple colour, half mixed with white, and that no one else was\r\nallowed to wear this mixture of white. He had loose trousers of a\r\nscarlet colour, and a robe entirely purple. Cf. also _Strabo_ (xv. 3),\r\nwhere the tiara is said to be in the shape of a tower; and Seneca (_De\r\nBeneficiis_, vi. 31); _Ammianus_, xviii. 8, 5.\r\n\r\n[482] See Xenophon (_Anab._, i. 2, 27; _Cyropaedia_, viii. 3);\r\n_Curtius_ (iii. 8).\r\n\r\n[483] These people are also called Drangians. They lived west of\r\nArachosia in Drangiana.\r\n\r\n[484] According to Plutarch (_Alex._, 48, 49) Alexander suborned\r\nAntigonē, the mistress of Philotas, to reveal his secret conversation.\r\n\r\n[485] Cf. _Curtius_, vi. 32.\r\n\r\n[486] The word ἐπιμηνυτής is found nowhere else in\r\nany Greek author.\r\n\r\n[487] Full details of the conspiracy and trial of Philotas are given by\r\n_Curtius_ (vi. 25-44).\r\n\r\n[488] Arrian says nothing about Philotas being put to the torture; but\r\nthis fact is asserted with ample details by Plutarch (_Alex._, 49);\r\n_Diodorus_ (xvii. 80); _Curtius_ (vi. 42, 43); and _Justin_ (xii. 5).\r\n\r\n[489] Full particulars of the murder of Parmenio are given by _Curtius_\r\n(vii. 7-9).\r\n\r\n[490] For the trial of Amyntas, cf. _Curtius_, vii. 2-6.\r\n\r\n[491] Alexander also formed a separate cohort of the men who were\r\npronounced sympathisers with Parmenio, and this cohort afterwards\r\ngreatly distinguished itself. See _Diodorus_, xvii. 80; _Curtius_, vii.\r\n10; _Justin_, xii. 5.\r\n\r\n[492] The Ariaspians inhabited the south part of Drangiana on the\r\nborders of Gadrosia. The river Etymander, now known as the Hilmend,\r\nflowed through their territories. Cf. _Curtius_, vii. 11; _Diodorus_,\r\nxvii. 81.\r\n\r\n[493] Gadrosia was the furthest province of the Persian empire on the\r\nsouth-east. It comprised the south-east part of Beloochistan.\r\n\r\n[494] This was not the range usually so called, but what was known\r\nas the Indian Caucasus, the proper name being Paropanisus. It is now\r\ncalled Hindu-Koosh.\r\n\r\n[495] This city was probably on the site of Beghram, twenty-five miles\r\nnorth-east of Cabul. See Grote’s _Greece_, vol. xii. ch. 94.\r\n\r\n[496] There are two kinds of silphium or laserpitium, the Cyrenaic, and\r\nthe Persian. The latter is usually called asafœtida. See _Herodotus_\r\n(iv. 169); Pliny (_Historia Naturalis_, xix. 15; xxiii. 48); Aelian\r\n(_Varia Historia_, xii. 37); Aristophanes (_Plutus_, 925); Plautus\r\n(_Rud._, iii. 2, 16); _Catullus_ (vii. laserpitiferis Cyrenis).\r\n\r\n[497] Cyrene was a colony founded by Battus from Thera, an island\r\ncolonized by the Spartans. The territory of Cyrenaica is now a part of\r\nTripoli. Cf. Pindar (_Pyth._, iv. 457); _Herodotus_ (iv. 159-205).\r\n\r\n[498] This Tanais was usually called Jaxartes, now Sir, flowing into\r\nthe sea of Aral.\r\n\r\n[499] The Oxus, now called Jihoun or Amou, flows into the sea of Aral,\r\nbut formerly flowed into the Caspian.\r\n\r\n[500] Some think this town stood where Naksheh now is, and others think\r\nit was at Kesch.\r\n\r\n[501] Cf. Xenophon, _Anab._, i. 5, 10.\r\n\r\n[502] _Curtius_ (vii. 24) follows the account of Aristobulus, and so\r\ndoes _Diodorus_ (xvii. 83) in the main. Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_,\r\nxii. 37).\r\n\r\n[503] The modern Samarcand.\r\n\r\n[504] Arrian and Strabo are wrong in stating that the Jaxartes rises in\r\nthe Caucasus, or Hindu-Koosh. It springs from the Comedae Montes, now\r\ncalled Moussour. It does not flow into the Hyrcanian, or Caspian Sea,\r\nbut into the Sea of Aral. It is about 900 miles long.\r\n\r\n[505] The river Tanais, of which Herodotus speaks (iv. 45, 57), is the\r\nDon; and the Lake Maeotis, is the Sea of Azov. Cf. _Strabo_ (vii. cc. 3\r\nand 4).\r\n\r\n[506] _Euxeinos_ (kind to strangers); called before the Greeks settled\r\nupon it _Axenos_ (inhospitable). See Ovid (_Tristia_, iv. 4). Cf.\r\n_Ammianus_ (xxii. 8, 33): “A contrario per cavillationem Pontus Euxinus\r\nadpellatur, et euethen Graeci dicimus stultum, et noctem euphronen et\r\nfurias Eumenidas.”\r\n\r\n[507] So _Curtius_ (vi. 6) makes the Don the boundary of Europe\r\nand Asia. “Tanais Europam et Asiam medius interfuit.” Ammianus\r\nsays: “Tanais inter Caucasias oriens rupes, per sinuosos labitur\r\ncircumflexus, Asiamque disterminans ab Europa, in stagnis Maeoticis\r\ndelitescit.” The Rha, or Volga, is first mentioned by Ptolemy in the\r\nsecond century of the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[508] Gadeira is now called Cadiz. The Greeks called the continent of\r\nAfrica by the name of Libya. So _Polybius_ (iii. 37) says that the Don\r\nis the boundary of Europe, and that Libya is separated from Asia and\r\nEurope respectively by the Nile and the Straits of Gibraltar, or, as\r\nhe calls the latter, “the mouth at the pillars of Hercules.” Arrian\r\nhere, like many ancient authors, considers Libya a part of Asia. Cf.\r\n_Juvenal_, x. i.\r\n\r\n[509] _Curtius_ (vii. 23) gives an account of the massacre by Alexander\r\nof the descendants of the Branchidae, who had surrendered to Xerxes\r\nthe treasures of the temple of Apollo near Miletus, and who, to escape\r\nthe vengeance of the Greeks, had accompanied Xerxes into the interior.\r\nThey had been settled in Sogdiana, and their descendants had preserved\r\nthemselves distinct from the barbarians for 150 years, till the arrival\r\nof Alexander. We learn from the table of contents of the 17th book of\r\n_Diodorus_, that that historian also gave an account of this atrocity\r\nof Alexander in the part of his history, now lost, which came after the\r\n83rd chapter. Cf. _Herodotus_ (i. 92, 157; v. 36); _Strabo_ (xi. 11;\r\nxiv. 1).\r\n\r\n[510] See Homer’s _Iliad_, xiii. 6. Cf. _Curtius_, vii. 26; _Ammianus_,\r\nxxiii. 6.\r\n\r\n[511] Cf. _Thucydides_, ii. 97.\r\n\r\n[512] _Curtius_ (vii. 26) says, he sent one of his friends named Berdes\r\non this mission.\r\n\r\n[513] This was called Alexandria Ultima, on the Jaxartes, probably the\r\nmodern Khojend.\r\n\r\n[514] Cf. _Curtius_ (vii. 26). Zariaspa was another name for Bactra.\r\nSee _Pliny_ (vi. 18) and _Strabo_ (xi. 11).\r\n\r\n[515] This city was also called Cyreschata, because it was the furthest\r\ncity founded by Cyrus, and the extreme city of the Persian empire.\r\n\r\n[516] δυσί was not used in Attic Greek, or but seldom. It\r\nbecame common after the time of Alexander.\r\n\r\n[517] Instead of ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ, Sintenis reads ἡμέραν μίαν.\r\n\r\n[518] This city was called by the Greeks, Alexandria on the Tanais. See\r\n_Curtius_, vii. 28.\r\n\r\n[519] Cf. _Livy_, xxi. 27:—Hispani sine ulla mole in utres vestimentis\r\nconjectis ipsi caetris superpositis incubantes flumen tranavere.\r\n\r\n[520] See _Herodotus_, iv. 122-142.\r\n\r\n[521] This was Maracanda, according to iii. 30 supra. There is an error\r\nin the text; Abicht proposes to read ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια,\r\ninstead of ἐς τὰ βασίλεια.\r\n\r\n[522] This river is now called Sogd, or Kohik. The Greek name signifies\r\n“very precious,” a translation of the native name. Cf. _Strabo_, p. 518.\r\n\r\n[523] _Curtius_ (vii. 32) says that Spitamenes laid an ambush for the\r\nMacedonians, and slew 300 cavalry and 2,000 infantry.\r\n\r\n[524] About 170 miles.\r\n\r\n[525] _Curtius_ (vii. 40) says that Alexander founded six cities in\r\nBactria and Sogdiana. _Justin_ (xii. 5) says there were twelve.\r\n\r\n[526] This is a mistake; for it ends in a lake Dengiz near Karakoul.\r\n\r\n[527] The Areius is now called Heri-rud. The Etymander is the modern\r\nHilmend. Nothing is known of the Epardus.\r\n\r\n[528] The Peneius is now called Salambria. It forces its way through\r\nthe vale of Tempe, between mounts Olympus and Ossa, into the sea. Cf.\r\nOvid (_Met._, i. 568-576).\r\n\r\n[529] On the analogy of πρὶν the later prose-writers use\r\nἔστε with the infinitive. Cf. _Arrian_, ii. 1, 3; v. 16,\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[530] See Bk. iii. ch. 29 supra.\r\n\r\n[531] See Bk. iii. ch. 19 supra.\r\n\r\n[532] See Bk. iii. ch. 16 supra.\r\n\r\n[533] _Curtius_ (vii. 40) says that the reinforcement was 19,000 men.\r\n\r\n[534] Cf. Plutarch (_Alex._, 43); _Diodorus_ (xvii. 83).\r\n\r\n[535] _I.e._ non-Hellenic.\r\n\r\n[536] Cf. _Diodorus_, xvii. 77; _Justin_, xii. 3. We learn from\r\nPlutarch (_Alex._, 45), that he did not assume the tiara of the Persian\r\nkings. Cf. _Arrian_, vii. 9; vii. 29 infra. The Medic robe was a long\r\nsilken garment reaching to the feet, and falling round the body in many\r\ndeep folds.\r\n\r\n[537] Caranus, a descendant of Temenus, king of Argos, is said to have\r\nsettled in Macedonia, and to have become the founder of the dynasty\r\nof Macedonian kings. Temenus was a descendant of Heracles. Cf. ii.\r\n5; iv. 10. One of the chief causes of disgust which the Greeks felt\r\nat the conduct of Pausanias, the conqueror at Plataea, was, that he\r\nadopted the Persian attire. “This pedigree from Temenus and Hercules\r\nmay be suspicious; yet it was allowed, after a strict inquiry by the\r\njudges of the Olympic games (_Herodotus_, v. 22), at a time when\r\nthe Macedonian kings were obscure and unpopular in Greece. When the\r\nAchaean league declared against Philip, it was thought decent that the\r\ndeputies of Argos should retire (_T. Liv._, xxxii. 22).”—_Gibbon._ Cf.\r\n_Herodotus_, viii. 137; _Thucydides_, ii. 99, 100; v. 80.\r\n\r\n[538] Cf. _Curtius_, viii. 6.\r\n\r\n[539] The sons of Jove, Castor and Pollux. ἐπιφρασθέντα is a word\r\nborrowed from Homer and Herodotus.\r\n\r\n[540] Cf. _Curtius_, viii. 17: “Non deerat talia concupiscenti\r\nperniciosa adulatio perpetuum malum regum, quorum opes saepius\r\nassentatio quam hostis evertit.”\r\n\r\n[541] _Curtius_ (viii. 3 and 4) says that it was Alexander himself that\r\nspoke depreciatingly of Philip, and that Clitus even dared to defend\r\nthe murdered Parmenio.\r\n\r\n[542] Instead of the usual reading from καὶ ταύτῃ to καὶ ταύτην,\r\nSintenis reads οἱ δὲ σάρισαν παρὰ τῶν φυλάκων τινὸς καὶ ταύτῃ παίσαντα\r\nτὸν Κλεῖτον ἀποκτεῖναι.\r\n\r\n[543] Cf. _Curtius_ (viii. 3 and 6), who calls the sister of Clitus,\r\nHellanice.\r\n\r\n[544] From Plutarch (_Alex._, 13) we learn that Alexander imagined he\r\nhad incurred the avenging wrath of Bacchus by destroying Thebes, the\r\nbirthplace of that deity, on which account it was supposed to be under\r\nhis tutelary care.\r\n\r\n[545] _Curtius_ (viii. 6) says, that in order to console the king, the\r\nMacedonian army passed a vote that Clitus had been justly slain, and\r\nthat his corpse should not be buried. But the king ordered its burial.\r\n\r\n[546] A philosopher of Abdera, and pupil of Democritus. After\r\nAlexander’s death, Anaxarchus was thrown by shipwreck into the hands of\r\nNicocreon, king of Cyprus, to whom he had given offence, and who had\r\nhim pounded to death in a mortar.\r\n\r\n[547] Cf. Sophocles (_Oedipus Col._, 1382; _Antigone_, 451); Hesiod\r\n(_Opera et Dies_, 254-257); Pindar (_Olympia_, viii. 28); Demosthenes\r\n(_Advers. Aristogiton_, p. 772); _Herodotus_, iii. 31.\r\n\r\n[548] Plutarch (_Alex._, 52) tells us that Callisthenes the philosopher\r\nwas also summoned with Anaxarchus to administer consolation, but he\r\nadopted such a different tone that Alexander was displeased with him.\r\n\r\n[549] _Curtius_ (viii. 17) says that Agis was the composer of very poor\r\npoems.\r\n\r\n[550] _Justin_ (xii. 6) says that Callisthenes was a fellow-student\r\nwith Alexander under Aristotle. He composed three historical works: I.\r\n_Hellenica_, from B.C. 387 to 337; II. _The History of the Sacred War_,\r\nfrom B.C. 357 to 346; III. _The History of Alexander._ Cf. _Diodorus_,\r\nxiv. 117. According to _Polybius_ (xii. 23), he was accused by Timaeus\r\nof having flattered Alexander in his History.\r\n\r\n[551] Hipparchus was slain B.C. 514, and Hippias was expelled from\r\nAthens B.C. 510. See _Thucydides_, vi. 53-59.\r\n\r\n[552] Eurystheus was king over Argos and Mycenae alone.\r\n\r\n[553] When Conon the famous Athenian visited Babylon, he would not\r\nsee Artaxerxes, from repugnance to the ceremony of prostration, which\r\nwas required from all who approached the Great King. We are also\r\ninformed by Plutarch (_Artaxerxes_, 22), that Pelopidas declined\r\nto perform this ceremony, so degrading in the eyes of the Greeks.\r\nHis colleague, Ismenias, however, dropped his ring in front of the\r\nking, and then stooped to pick it up, thus going through the act of\r\nprostration. Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_, i. 21). Xenophon said to his\r\nsoldiers:—οὐδένα γὰρ ἄνθρωπον δεσπότην ἀλλὰ τοὺς θεοὺς προσκυνεῖτε.\r\n(_Anab._, iii. 13).\r\n\r\n[554] _Curtius_ (viii. 18) says that the speech proposing to honour\r\nAlexander as a god was made by Cleon, a Sicilian Greek.\r\n\r\n[555] ἀχθομένους. The usual reading is μαχομένους.\r\n\r\n[556] Cf. Xenophon (_Cyrop._, 4, 27):—λέγεται τοὺς συγγενεῖς φιλοῦντας\r\nἀποπέμπεσθαι αὐτὸν νόμῳ Περσικῷ.\r\n\r\n[557] πρόσκεινται. Cf. _Herodotus_, i. 118:—τοῖσι θεῶν τιμὴ αὕτη\r\nπροσκέεται.\r\n\r\n[558] Alexander’s mother Olympias was daughter of Neoptolemus, king of\r\nEpirus, who traced his descent from Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, the\r\ngrandson of Aeacus.\r\n\r\n[559] οἱ λόγοι γίγνονται. There is another reading, ὀλίγοι γίγνωνται.\r\n\r\n[560] Cf. _Herodotus_, i. 214, with Dean Blakesley’s note.\r\n\r\n[561] _Curtius_ (viii. 20) says, that it was Polysperchon who made\r\nsport of the Persian, and incurred the king’s wrath.\r\n\r\n[562] _Ammianus_ (xviii. 3) says: “Ignorans profecto vetus Aristotelis\r\nsapiens dictum, qui Callisthenem sectatorem et propinquum suum ad regem\r\nAlexandrum mittens, ei saepe mandabat, ut quam rarissime et jucunde\r\napud hominem loqueretur, vitae potestatem et necis in acie linguae\r\nportantem.”\r\n\r\n[563] Cf. _Curtius_ (viii. 21); Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xiv. 49).\r\nAfter the battle of Pydna, where the Romans conquered the Macedonians,\r\nthe _pueri regii_ followed the defeated king Perseus to the sanctuary\r\nat Samothrace, and never quitted him till he surrendered to the Romans.\r\nSee _Livy_, xlv. 6.\r\n\r\n[564] For this use of διαπίπτειν, cf. Aristophanes\r\n(_Knights_, 695); _Polybius_ (v. 26, 16); διαπεσούσης αὐτῷ τῆς\r\nἐπιβουλῆς.\r\n\r\n[565] Alexander wrote to Craterus, Attalus, and Alcetas, that the\r\npages, though put to the torture, asserted that no one but themselves\r\nwas privy to the conspiracy. In another letter, written to Antipater\r\nthe regent of Macedonia, he says that the pages had been stoned\r\nto death by the Macedonians, but that he himself would punish the\r\nSophist, and those who sent him out, and those who harboured in their\r\ncities conspirators against him. Aristotle had sent Callisthenes out.\r\nAlexander refers to him and the Athenians. See Plutarch (_Alex._, 55).\r\n\r\n[566] Cf. _Arrian_ (vii. 29).\r\n\r\n[567] _Curtius_ (viii. 29) says that Alexander afterwards repented\r\nof his guilt in murdering the philosopher. His tragical death\r\nexcited great indignation among the ancient philosophers. See Seneca\r\n(_Naturales Quaestiones_, vi. 23); Cicero (_Tusc. Disput._, iii. 10),\r\nspeaking of Theophrastus, the friend of Callisthenes.\r\n\r\n[568] We find from chapter xxii. that these events occurred at Bactra.\r\n\r\n[569] The Chorasmians were a people who inhabited the country near the\r\nlower part of the river Oxus, between the Caspian and Aral Seas.\r\n\r\n[570] This mythical race of warlike females is said to have come from\r\nthe Caucasus and to have settled near the modern Trebizond, their\r\noriginal abode being in Colchis. Cf. _Arrian_ (vii. 13); _Strabo_\r\n(xi. 5); _Diod._ (xvii. 77); _Curt._ (vi. 19); _Justin_ (xii. 3);\r\nHomer (_Iliad_, iii. 189); Aeschўlus (_Eumenides_, 655); _Herod._ (iv.\r\n110-116; ix. 27).\r\n\r\n[571] See iii. 29 supra.\r\n\r\n[572] Propontis means the sea _before the Pontus_. Compare Ovid\r\n(_Tristia_, i. 10, 31):—“Quaque tenent _Ponti_ Byzantia littora\r\n_fauces_.”\r\n\r\n[573] We learn, from _Curtius_ (viii. 3), that it was at this place\r\nthat Clitus was murdered.\r\n\r\n[574] These were a people dwelling to the north-east of the Caspian,\r\nwho were chiefly remarkable for having defeated and killed Cyrus the\r\nGreat. See _Herodotus_, i. 201-216.\r\n\r\n[575] There were two other generals named Peithon; one the son of\r\nAgenor, and the other the son of Crateas. See _Arrian_, vi. 15, 28, etc.\r\n\r\n[576] _Curtius_ (viii. 1) says that the name of the defeated general\r\nwas Attinas.\r\n\r\n[577] Artabazus was in his 95th year when he joined Alexander with\r\nthe Grecian troops of Darius in B.C. 330. See _Curtius_, vi. 14. His\r\nviceroyalty was destined for Clitus; but on the death of that general\r\nit was conferred on Amyntas. See _Curtius_, viii. 3.\r\n\r\n[578] _Curtius_ (viii. 11 and 12) says that the wife of Spitamenes\r\nmurdered him and carried his head to Alexander.\r\n\r\n[579] The Hebrew name for Media is Madai, which means _middle-land_.\r\nThe Greeks called the country Media, according to _Polybius_ (v. 44),\r\nbecause it lies near the middle of Asia.\r\n\r\n[580] Of the year 327 B.C.\r\n\r\n[581] ὤρα, akin to Latin _cura_, a poetical and Ionic word, often found\r\nin Herodotus.\r\n\r\n[582] About £2,700.\r\n\r\n[583] About £327. _Curtius_ (vii. 41) says that the first prize was 10\r\ntalents, the second 9 talents, and the same proportion for the eight\r\nothers, so that the tenth man who mounted received one talent. The\r\nstater of Darius, usually called a daricus, was a gold coin of Persia.\r\nSee Smith’s _Dictionary of Antiquities_.\r\n\r\n[584] Cf. _Curtius_ (vii. 43), vela, signum capti verticis.\r\n\r\n[585] Roxana and her son Alexander Aegus were put to death by\r\nCassander, B.C. 311.\r\n\r\n[586] Statira. She died shortly before the battle of Arbela.\r\n\r\n[587] καρτερὸς αὑτοῦ. Cf. _Theocritus_, xv. 94, ἁμῶν καρτερός.\r\n\r\n[588] After the capture of Damascus, Alexander married Barsine,\r\nthe widow of his rival Memnon, and daughter of Artabazus. She was\r\ndistinguished for her beauty and accomplishments, having received a\r\nGrecian education. By her he had a son named Heracles. See Plutarch\r\n(_Alex._, 21). She and her son were put to death by Polysperchon, B.C.\r\n309.\r\n\r\n[589] Cf. _Herodotus_, i. 131; _Curtius_, iv. 42. The Persians called\r\nthis god Ormuzd.\r\n\r\n[590] _Curtius_ (viii. 16) says that Alexander saw Roxana at a banquet\r\ngiven by Oxyartes in his honour.\r\n\r\n[591] Krüger substituted περιεῖργε for περιέργει.\r\n\r\n[592] βατά. Cf. Xenophon (_Anab._, iv. 6, 17).\r\n\r\n[593] Arrian imitates Herodotus in the use of ὡς with the\r\ninfinitive instead of ὥστε.\r\n\r\n[594] This term is a Persian word meaning mountaineers. The tribe\r\nmentioned here lived between the rivers Oxus and Jaxartes, on the\r\nborders of Bactria and Sogdiana.\r\n\r\n[595] _Curtius_ (viii. 17) says Alexander took with him 30,000 select\r\ntroops from all the conquered provinces, and that the army which he led\r\nagainst the Indians numbered 120,000 men.\r\n\r\n[596] This is the Indian Caucasus, or mount Parapamisus, now called\r\nHindu-Koosh.\r\n\r\n[597] The Cophen is now called Cabul. Nicaea was probably on the\r\nsame site as the city of Cabul. Others say it is Beghram. The Greek\r\nword _Satrapes_ denotes a Persian viceroy. It is a corruption of a\r\nword meaning _court-guardian_, in the Behistûn Inscriptions written\r\nKhshatrapâ. See Rawlinson’s _Herod._, i. 192.\r\n\r\n[598] _Curtius_ (viii. 43) says that Taxiles was the title which the\r\nking of this district received. His name was Omphis.\r\n\r\n[599] A district between the rivers Indus and Attock. Its capital,\r\nPeucela, is the modern Pekheli.\r\n\r\n[600] The brigade of Clitus still bore the name of its commander after\r\nhis death. Cf. _Arrian_, vii. 14 infra.\r\n\r\n[601] These were tribes living in the north-west of the Punjab.\r\n\r\n[602] Probably the modern Kama, a tributary of the Cabul.\r\n\r\n[603] Supposed to be another name for the Choes.\r\n\r\n[604] καὶ τοὺς ψιλοὺς. The usual reading is τοὺς χιλίους, 1,000\r\n_Agrianians_.\r\n\r\n[605] A tributary of the Cophen, probably what is now called the\r\nLundye, running parallel with the Kama.\r\n\r\n[606] Cf. _Livy_, xxi. 31:—“Amnis saxa glareosa volvens, nihil stabile\r\nnec tutum ingredienti praebet.”\r\n\r\n[607] This was the capital of the Assacenians. _Curtius_ (viii. 37)\r\ncalls it Mazagae, and describes its strong position.\r\n\r\n[608] See Bk. ii. 23 supra.\r\n\r\n[609] _Curtius_ (viii. 37, 38) says that the name of the queen was\r\nCleophis, and that after the surrender she gained Alexander’s favour.\r\nHe also informs us that the king died just before Alexander’s arrival.\r\n\r\n[610] Probably Bajour, north-west of Peshawur. The position of Ora\r\ncannot be fixed.\r\n\r\n[611] This was the king of the Indian mountaineers. See _Arrian_, v. 8\r\ninfra.\r\n\r\n[612] On the ground of ἐν τῇ πόλει ξυμφυγόντες not being classical\r\nGreek, Krüger has substituted ἐν τῇ πόλει ξυμπεφευγότες, and Sintenis\r\nεἰς τὴν πόλιν ξυμφυγόντες. No one however ought to expect Arrian to\r\nbe free from error, writing, as he did, in the middle of the second\r\ncentury of the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[613] This seems to be the Greek translation of the native name,\r\nmeaning the place to which no bird can rise on account of its height.\r\nCf. _Strabo_, xv. 1. This mountain was identified by Major Abbot, in\r\n1854, as Mount Mahabunn, near the right bank of the Indus, about 60\r\nmiles above its confluence with the Cabul.\r\n\r\n[614] Cf. _Arrian_, ii. 16 supra.\r\n\r\n[615] _Curtius_ (viii. 39) says that the river Indus washed the base\r\nof the rock, and that its shape resembled the _meta_ or goal in a\r\nrace-course, which was a stone shaped like a sugar-loaf. Arrian’s\r\ndescription is more likely to be correct as he took it from Ptolemy,\r\none of Alexander’s generals.\r\n\r\n[616] Near mount Mababunn are two places called Umb and Balimah, the\r\none in the valley of the river and the other on the mountain above it.\r\nSee Major Abbot’s _Gradus ad Aornon_.\r\n\r\n[617] δαήμων, a poetical word. Cf. Homer (_Odyssey_, viii. 159).\r\n\r\n[618] Probably Dyrta was at the point where the Indus issues from the\r\nHindu-Koosh.\r\n\r\n[619] Gronovius first introduced καὶ before τοὺς ψιλούς.\r\n\r\n[620] The name Indus is derived from the Sanscrit appellation _Sindhu_,\r\nfrom a root _Syandh_, meaning _to flow_. The name Indians, or Sindians,\r\nwas originally applied only to the dwellers on the banks of this river.\r\n_Hindustan_ is a Persian word meaning the country of the Hindus or\r\nSindus. Compare the modern Sinde, in the north-west of India, which\r\ncontains the lower course of the Indus. In Hebrew India was called\r\nHodu, which is a contraction of Hondu, another form of Hindu. See\r\nEsther i. 1; viii. 9. Krüger changed ὡδοποιεῖτο\r\ninto ὡδοποίει.\r\n\r\n[621] This city was probably on the site of Jelalabad.\r\n\r\n[622] ἐπεί τε. This is the only place where Arrian\r\nuses this Ionic form for the simple ἐπεί.\r\n\r\n[623] The Indians worship a god Homa, the personification of the\r\nintoxicating soma juice. This deity corresponds to the Greek Dionysus\r\nor Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[624] The slopes of this mountain were covered with vines. See Ovid\r\n(_Fasti_, ii. 313; _Metamorphoses_, xi. 86); Vergil (_Georgics_, ii.\r\n98); _Pliny_, xiv. 9.\r\n\r\n[625] φανείη. Arrian does not comply with the Attic rule, that the\r\nsubjunctive should follow the principal tenses in the leading sentence.\r\nCf. v. 6, 6; 7, 5; vii. 7, 5; 15, 2.\r\n\r\n[626] Cf. Pliny (_Nat. Hist._, vi. 23; viii. 60; xvi. 62). The ordinary\r\nreading is ἄλση παντοῖα· καὶ δεῖν σύσκιον.\r\nFor this Krüger has proposed ἄλση παντοίᾳ ὕλῃ σύσκια.\r\n\r\n[627] The other names of Dionysus were: Bacchus, Bromius, Evius,\r\nIacchus, Lenaeus, Lyaens. The Romans called him Liber.\r\n\r\n[628] _Curtius_ (viii. 36) says that the Macedonians celebrated\r\nBacchanalia for the space of ten days on this mountain.\r\n\r\n[629] The 1st aor. pass. ἐσχέθην is found only in\r\nArrian and Plutarch. Cf. vii. 22, 2 infra.\r\n\r\n[630] The celebrated Geographer and Mathematician, who was born B.C.\r\n276 and died about B.C. 196. His principal work was one on geography,\r\nwhich was of great use to Strabo. None of his works are extant. He was\r\nmade president of the Alexandrian library, B.C. 236.\r\n\r\n[631] Cf. Arrian (_Indica_, v. 11).\r\n\r\n[632] The earliest mention of India which has descended to our times is\r\nin Aeschўlus (_Supplices_, 284).\r\n\r\n[633] Arrian frequently uses the Ionic and old Attic word, σμικρός.\r\n\r\n[634] About £480,000.\r\n\r\n[635] Alexander probably crossed the Indus near Attock. The exact site\r\nof Taxila cannot be fixed.\r\n\r\n[636] The Hydaspes is now called Jelum, one of the five great\r\ntributaries of the Indus.\r\n\r\n[637] Herodotus considered the Danube the largest river in the world\r\nas known to him, and the Dnieper the largest of all rivers except the\r\nDanube and the Nile. See _Herodotus_, iv. 48-53.\r\n\r\n[638] “Amnis Danubius sexaginta navigabiles paene recipiens fluvios,\r\nseptem ostiis erumpit in mare. Quorum primum est Peuce insula supra\r\ndicta, ut interpretata sunt vocabula Graeco sermone, secundum\r\nNaracustoma, tertium Calonstoma, quartum Pseudostoma: nam Boreonstoma\r\nac deinde Sthenostoma longe minora sunt caeteris: septimum ingens et\r\npalustri specie nigrum.”—_Ammianus_ (xxii. 8, 44). _Pliny_ (iv. 24)\r\nsays that the Danube has six mouths, the names of which he gives.\r\n\r\n[639] The Indus does not rise in the Parapamisus, but in the Himalayas.\r\nIt has two principal mouths, but there are a number of smaller ones.\r\nPtolemy said there were seven. The Delta is between 70 and 80 miles\r\nbroad. “Delta, a triquetrae litterae forma hoc vocabulo signatius\r\nadpellata.”—_Ammianus_, xxii. 15.\r\n\r\n[640] The territory included by the Indus and its four affluents is now\r\ncalled Punjab, a Persian word meaning _five rivers_.\r\n\r\n[641] Ctesias was the Greek physician of Artaxerxes Mnemon. He wrote\r\na history of Persia and a book on India. His works are only preserved\r\nin meagre abridgement by Photius. Aristotle says that he was false\r\nand untrustworthy (_Hist. of Animals_, viii. 27; _De Generatione\r\nAnimalium_, ii. 2). Subsequent research has proved Ctesias to be wrong\r\nand Herodotus generally right in the many statements in which they are\r\nat variance.\r\n\r\n[642] The fact is, that the Indus is nowhere more than 20 stades, or\r\n2-1/2 miles broad.\r\n\r\n[643] See _Strabo_, xv. 1; xvi. 4; _Herod._, iii. 102, with Dean\r\nBlakesley’s note.\r\n\r\n[644] οὐδαμῶν is the Ionic form for οὐδένων.\r\n\r\n[645] The Greek name Αἴθιοψ means _sunburnt_.\r\nThe Hebrew name for Aethiopia is Cush (black). In ancient Egyptian\r\ninscriptions it is called _Keesh_. It is the country now called\r\nAbyssinia. Aethiopas vicini sideris vapore torreri, adustisque similes\r\ngigni, barba et capillo vibrato, non est dubium. (_Pliny_, ii. 80).\r\n\r\n[646] Cf. Xenophon (_Cyropaedia_, vii. 5, 67).\r\n\r\n[647] Called the _Indica_, a valuable little work in the Ionic dialect,\r\nstill existing.\r\n\r\n[648] Nearchus left an account of his voyage, which is not now extant.\r\nArrian made use of it in writing the _Indica_. See that work, chapters\r\nxvii. to lxiii.\r\n\r\n[649] Megasthenes was sent with the Plataean Dēimachus, by Seleucus\r\nNicator, the king of Syria and one of Alexander’s generals, as\r\nambassador to Sandracotus, king of the country near the Ganges. He\r\nwrote a very valuable account of India in four books.\r\n\r\n[650] _Taurus_ is from the old root tor meaning _high_, another form of\r\nwhich is _dor_. Hence Dorians = highlanders.\r\n\r\n[651] The ancient geographers thought that the Jaxartes bifurcated,\r\npart of it forming the Tanais, or Don, and flowing into the lake\r\nMaeotis, or Sea of Azov; and the other part falling into the Hyrcanian,\r\nor Caspian Sea. The Jaxartes and Oxus flow into the Sea of Aral, but\r\nthe ancients thought that they fell into the Caspian, as there is\r\nindeed evidence to prove that they once did. _Hyrcania_ is the Greek\r\nform of the old Persian _Virkâna_, that is _Wolf’s Land_. It is now\r\ncalled Gurgân.\r\n\r\n[652] _Herodotus_ (i. 203) states decidedly that the Caspian is an\r\ninland sea. _Strabo_ (xi. 1), following Eratosthenes, says that it is a\r\ngulf of the Northern Ocean.\r\n\r\n[653] The Euphrates, after its junction with the Tigres, flows through\r\nthe marshes of Lamlum, where its current moves less than a mile an hour.\r\n\r\n[654] Cf. _Arrian_, vi. 27 infra.\r\n\r\n[655] Probably the Chandragupta of the Sanscrit writers. He conquered\r\nfrom the Macedonians the Punjab and the country as far as the\r\nHindu-Koosh. He reigned about 310 B.C.\r\n\r\n[656] Mount Dindymus, now called Murad Dagh, was sacred to Cybele, the\r\nmother of the gods, who was hence called Dindymene.\r\n\r\n[657] Hecataeus of Miletus died about B.C. 476. He wrote a work upon\r\nGeography, and another on History. His works were well known to\r\nHerodotus but only fragments survive.\r\n\r\n[658] See _Herodotus_, ii. 5.\r\n\r\n[659] See _Herodotus_, ii. 10-34.\r\n\r\n[660] See Homer’s _Odyssey_, iv. 477, 581. In Hebrew the name for\r\nEgypt is _Mitsraim_ (dark-red). In form the word is dual, evidently in\r\nreference to the division of the country by the Nile. The native name\r\nwas _Chem_, meaning _black_, probably on account of the blackness of\r\nthe alluvial soil.\r\n\r\n[661] ἄλλοι is Abicht’s reading instead of πολλοί.\r\n\r\n[662] Arrian, in his _Indica_, chap. 4, gives the names of these rivers.\r\n\r\n[663] See _Herodotus_, vii. 33-36; iv. 83, 97, 133-141. _Bosporus_ =\r\nOxford. The name was applied to the Straits of Constantinople, and\r\nalso to those of Yenikale, the former being called the Thracian and\r\nthe latter the Cimmerian Bosporus. Cf. Aeschўlus (_Prom._, 734). Ad\r\nBosporos duos, vel bubus meabili transitu; unde nomen ambobus (_Pliny_,\r\nvi. 1).\r\n\r\n[664] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 86) says that Alexander crossed on a bridge of\r\nboats. Cf. _Strabo_, p. 698; _Curtius_, viii. 34.\r\n\r\n[665] There was another river called Rhenus, a tributary of the Po, now\r\ncalled the Reno. It was called Rhenus Bononiensis, being near Bononia\r\nor Bologna.\r\n\r\n[666] αἱ πρύμναν κρουόμεναι. For this nautical term compare\r\n_Thucydides_, i. 51; _Herodotus_, viii. 84; _Diodorus_, xi. 18;\r\nAristophanes, _Wasps_, 399. κατὰ ῥοῦν is Krüger’s reading for the usual\r\nκατὰ πόρον.\r\n\r\n[667] The explanation of this passage given in Liddell and Scott’s\r\n_Lexicon_, sub voce κλῖμαξ, is evidently incorrect, as there is nothing\r\nabout a chariot in the original.\r\n\r\n[668] Compare the description of Cæsar’s bridge over the Rhine (_Gallic\r\nWar_, iv. 17).\r\n\r\n[669] The place where Alexander crossed the Indus was probably at its\r\njunction with the Cophen or Cabul river, near Attock. Before he crossed\r\nhe gave his army a rest of thirty days, as we learn from _Diodorus_,\r\nxvii. 86. From the same passage we learn that a certain king named\r\nAphrices with an army of 20,000 men and 15 elephants, was killed by his\r\nown men and his army joined Alexander.\r\n\r\n[670] The kingdom of Porus lay between the Hydaspes and Acesines, the\r\ndistrict now called Bari-doab with Lahore as capital. It was conquered\r\nby Lords Hardinge and Gough in 1849.\r\n\r\n[671] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 87) says that Porus had more than 50,000\r\ninfantry, about 3,000 cavalry, more than 1,000 chariots, and 130\r\nelephants. _Curtius_ (viii. 44) says he had about 30,000 infantry, 300\r\nchariots, and 85 elephants.\r\n\r\n[672] ἐπιτρέψας is Krüger’s reading instead of ἐπιτάξας.\r\n\r\n[673] About the month of May. See chap. 12 infra; also _Curtius_, viii.\r\n45, 46. _Strabo_ (xv. 1) quotes from Aristobulus describing the rainy\r\nseason at the time of Alexander’s battle with Porus at the Hydaspes.\r\n\r\n[674] Cf. _Arrian_, i. 14 supra.\r\n\r\n[675] ἀλλὰ κενόν is Krüger’s reading, instead of ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνον.\r\n\r\n[676] ἄλσει is Abicht’s reading for εἴδει.\r\n\r\n[677] About 17 miles.\r\n\r\n[678] This use of πρίν with infinitive after negative clauses, is\r\ncontrary to Attic usage.\r\n\r\n[679] The perf. pass. πέπηγμαι is used by Arrian and Dionysius, but by\r\nHomer and the Attic writers the form used is πέπηγα. _Doric_, πέπαγα.\r\n\r\n[680] Seleucus Nicator, the most powerful of Alexander’s successors,\r\nbecame king of Syria and founder of the dynasty of the Seleucidae,\r\nwhich came to an end in B.C. 79.\r\n\r\n[681] For this use of ὅσον, cf. Homer (_Iliad_, ix.\r\n354); _Herodotus_, iv. 45; Plato (_Gorgias_, 485 A; _Euthydemus_, 273\r\nA).\r\n\r\n[682] Compare the passage of the Rhone by Hannibal. (See _Livy_, xxi.\r\n26-28; _Polybius_, iii. 45, 46.)\r\n\r\n[683] 100 Greek and 101 English feet.\r\n\r\n[684] See Donaldson’s _New Cratylus_, sec. 178.\r\n\r\n[685] πρὶν κατίδωσιν. In Attic, πρὶν ἄν is the regular form with the\r\nsubjunctive; but in Homer and the Tragic writers ἄν is often omitted.\r\n\r\n[686] Cf. Arrian’s _Tactics_, chap. 29.\r\n\r\n[687] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 89) says that more than 12,000 Indians were\r\nkilled in this battle, over 9,000 being captured, besides 80 elephants.\r\n\r\n[688] According to Diodorus there fell of the Macedonians 280 cavalry\r\nand more than 700 infantry. Plutarch (_Alex._ 60) says that the battle\r\nlasted eight hours.\r\n\r\n[689] _Curtius_ (viii. 50, 51) represents Porus sinking half dead, and\r\nbeing protected to the last by his faithful elephant. _Diodorus_ (xvii.\r\n88) agrees with him.\r\n\r\n[690] Cf. _Curtius_, viii. 44; _Justin_, xii. 8.\r\n\r\n[691] Cf. _Arrian_, ii. 10 supra. δεδουλωμένος τῇ γνώμῃ. The Scholiast\r\non _Thucydides_ iv. 34, explains this by τεταπεινωμένος φόβῳ.\r\n\r\n[692] Cf. Plutarch (_Alex._, 60); _Curtius_, viii. 51.\r\n\r\n[693] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 87) says that the battle was fought in the\r\narchonship of Chremes at Athens.\r\n\r\n[694] Nicaea is supposed to be Mong and Bucephala may be Jelalpur. See\r\n_Strabo_, xv. 1.\r\n\r\n[695] Cf. Plutarch (_Alex._, 61). Schmieder says that Alexander could\r\nnot have broken in the horse before he was sixteen years old. But\r\nsince at this time he was in his twenty-ninth year he would have had\r\nhim thirteen years. Consequently the horse must have been at least\r\nseventeen years old when he acquired him. Can any one believe this? Yet\r\nPlutarch also states that the horse was thirty years old at his death.\r\n\r\n[696] _Curtius_ (vi. 17) says this occurred in the land of the\r\nMardians; whereas Plutarch (_Alex._, 44) says it happened in Hyrcania.\r\n\r\n[697] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 89), says Alexander made a halt of 30 days\r\nafter this battle.\r\n\r\n[698] Cf. _Arrian_, v. 8 supra, where an earlier embassy from Abisares\r\nis mentioned.\r\n\r\n[699] _Strabo_ (xv. 1) says that this Porus was a cousin of the Porus\r\ncaptured by Alexander.\r\n\r\n[700] This is the Chenab. See Arrian (_Indica_, iii.), who says that\r\nwhere it joins the Indus it is 30 stades broad.\r\n\r\n[701] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 95) says that Alexander received a\r\nreinforcement from Greece at this river of more than 30,000 infantry\r\nand nearly 6,000 cavalry; also suits of armour for 25,000 infantry, and\r\n100 talents of medical drugs.\r\n\r\n[702] Μέλλειν is usually connected with the future infinitive; but\r\nArrian frequently uses it with the present.\r\n\r\n[703] Now called the Ravi.\r\n\r\n[704] Sangala is supposed to be Lahore; but probably it lay some\r\ndistance from that city, on the bank of the Chenab.\r\n\r\n[705] Compare Cæsar (_Bell. Gall._, i. 26): pro vallo carros objecerant\r\net e loco superiore in nostros venientes tela conjiciebant, et nonnulli\r\ninter carros rotasque mataras ac tragulas subjiciebant nostrosque\r\nvulnerabant.\r\n\r\n[706] ἐγκυρεῖν is an epic and Ionic word rarely used in Attic; but\r\nfound frequently in _Herodotus_, _Homer_, _Hesiod_, and _Pindar_.\r\n\r\n[707] The Greeks had only three watches; but Arrian is speaking as a\r\nRoman.\r\n\r\n[708] Eumenes, of Cardia in Thrace, was private secretary to Philip\r\nand Alexander. After the death of the latter, he obtained the rule of\r\nCappadocia, Paphlagonia, and Pontus. He displayed great ability both\r\nas a general and statesman; but was put to death by Antigonus in B.C.\r\n316, when he was 45 years of age. Being a Greek, he was disliked by the\r\nMacedonian generals, from whom he experienced very unjust treatment.\r\nIt is evident from the biographies of him written by Plutarch and\r\nCornelius Nepos, that he was one of the most eminent men of his era.\r\n\r\n[709] Now called the Beas, or Bibasa. Strabo calls it Hypanis, and\r\nPliny calls it Hypasis.\r\n\r\n[710] In the Hebrew Bible Javan denotes the Ionian race of Greeks, and\r\nthen the Greeks in general (Gen. x. 2, 4; Isa. lxvi. 19; Ezek. xxvii.\r\n13; Joel iii. 6; Zech. ix. 13). In Dan. viii. 21, x. 20, xi. 2, Javan\r\nstands for the kingdom of Alexander the Great, comprising Macedonia\r\nas well as Greece. The form of the name _Javan_ is closely connected\r\nwith the Greek _Ion_, which originally had a digamma, _Ivon_. Pott\r\nsays that it means _the young_, in opposition to the _Graikoi_, the\r\nold. According to Aristotle (_Meteorologica_, i. 14) the Hellenes were\r\noriginally called Graikoi. Cf. Sanscrit, _jewan_; Zend, _jawan_; Latin,\r\n_juvenis_; English, _young_.\r\n\r\n[711] Coele-Syria, or the Hollow Syria, was the country between the\r\nranges of Libanus and Antilibanus. Syria between the rivers is usually\r\ncalled by its Greek name of Mesopotamia. It is the Padan Aram of\r\nthe Bible. Cappadocia embraced the whole north-eastern part of the\r\npeninsula of Asia Minor. Slaves were procured from this region. See\r\nHorace (_Epistles_, i. 6, 39); _Persius_, vi. 77. The name _Pamphylia_\r\nis from πᾶν and φυλή, because of the mixed origin of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[712] Cf. Arrian (_Anabasis_, vii. 1; _Indica_, 43). _Herodotus_ (iv.\r\n42) says that Pharaoh Neco sent a Phoenician expedition from the\r\nRed Sea, which circumnavigated Africa and returned by the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar, or the Pillars of Hercules. The Carthaginian Hanno is\r\nsaid to have sailed from Cadiz to the extremity of Arabia. See Pliny\r\n(_Historia Naturalis_, ii. 67; v. 1). _Herodotus_ (iv. 43) says that\r\nthe Carthaginians asserted they had sailed round Africa. There is a\r\nGreek translation of Hanno’s _Periplus_ still extant. As to the Pillars\r\nof Hercules, see Aelian (_Varia Historia_, v. 3). They are first\r\nmentioned by Pindar (_Olym._ iii. 79; _Nem._ iii. 36).\r\n\r\n[713] The interior of Africa, from the Straits of Gibraltar to Egypt,\r\nand from the Mediterranean to the then unexplored South.\r\n\r\n[714] Arrian, like many other ancient writers, includes Africa, or\r\nLibya, as a part of Asia. The boundaries were the Eastern Sea and the\r\nAtlas Mountains. Cf. _Arrian_, iii. 30; vii. 1 and 30. The name Asia\r\nfirst occurs in Homer (_Iliad_, ii. 461), in reference to the marsh\r\nabout the Caÿster, and was thence gradually extended over the whole\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n[715] Heracles, from whom the Macedonian kings claimed to be descended.\r\n\r\n[716] Hence Hercules is called Tirynthius. (Virgil, _Aeneid_, vii. 662;\r\nviii. 228).\r\n\r\n[717] See chap. 1 of this book.\r\n\r\n[718] Cf. Xenophon (_Anab._, i. 7, 4).\r\n\r\n[719] Cf. _Curtius_, ix. 12.\r\n\r\n[720] _Arrian_ (iii. 19) says that the Thessalians were sent back from\r\nEcbatana.\r\n\r\n[721] _Pontus Euxinus_ antea ab inhospitali feritate _Axenos_\r\nappellatus (_Pliny_, vi. 1).\r\n\r\n[722] The Latin name Carthago and the Greek Carchedon were corruptions\r\nof the Phoenician Carth-Hadeshoth, the “new city.”\r\n\r\n[723] _Pliny_ (vi. 21), says that Alexander erected the altars on the\r\nfarther bank of the Hyphasis, whereas Arrian, Diodorus, and Plutarch\r\nsay they were on this side of the river. _Curtius_ (ix. 13) does not\r\nspecify the side of the river.\r\n\r\n[724] _Herodotus_ (iv. 44) says that the Indus is the only river\r\nbesides the Nile which produces crocodiles. He does not seem to have\r\nknown the Ganges.\r\n\r\n[725] This was the _Nelumbium speciosum_, the Egyptian bean of\r\nPythagoras, the Lotus of the Hindus, held sacred by them. It is\r\ncultivated and highly valued in China, where it is eaten. The seeds are\r\nthe shape and size of acorns.\r\n\r\n[726] _I.e._ the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[727] See _Arrian_, v. 6 supra. The native name of Egypt was _Chem_\r\n(black). Compare Vergil (_Georgic._ iv. 291):—Viridem Aegyptum _nigrâ_\r\nfecundat arenâ. Usque coloratis amnis devexus ab Indis.\r\n\r\n[728] This use of ἀμφί with the dative is instead of the\r\nAttic περί with the genitive or accusative.\r\n\r\n[729] Plutarch (_Alex._ 66) informs us that Alexander’s army numbered\r\n120,000 infantry and 15,000 cavalry. Cf. Arrian (_Indica_, 19).\r\n\r\n[730] Arrian, in the _Indica_ (chap. 19), says that Alexander embarked\r\nwith 8,000 men.\r\n\r\n[731] _Strabo_ (xv. 1) says that the realm of Sopeithes was called\r\nCathaia.\r\n\r\n[732] As Alexander was at this time east of the Indus, the expression,\r\n“beyond the Indus,” means west of it.\r\n\r\n[733] Cf. _Arrian_, v. 2 supra.\r\n\r\n[734] Only fragments of this narrative are preserved. _Strabo_ (xv. 1)\r\nsays that the statements of Onesicritus are not to be relied upon.\r\n\r\n[735] _Curtius_ (ix. 13) and _Diodorus_ (xvii. 95) say that there were\r\n1,000 vessels. Arrian (_Indica_, 19) says there were 800. Krüger reads\r\nχιλίων in this passage instead of the common reading\r\nδισχιλίων.\r\n\r\n[736] From Arrian (_Indica_, 18) we learn that he sacrificed to his\r\ncountry gods, and to Poseidon, Amphitrite, the Nereids, the Ocean, as\r\nwell as to the three rivers. Cf. i. 11, supra.\r\n\r\n[737] Cf. iii. 3 supra.\r\n\r\n[738] Cf. Arrian (_Indica_, 7).\r\n\r\n[739] Cf. _Curtius_ (ix. 15); _Diodorus_ (xvii. 97). The latter says\r\nthat Alexander offered sacrifice to the gods for having escaped the\r\ngreatest danger, and having contested with a river like Achilles.\r\n\r\n[740] According to _Diodorus_ (xvii. 96) and _Curtius_ (ix. 14)\r\nAlexander here made an expedition against the Sibi; defeated an army of\r\n40,000 Indians, and captured the city of Agallassa.\r\n\r\n[741] The chief city of the Mallians is the modern Mooltan.\r\n\r\n[742] Μήπω. In later writers μή is often used where the Attic writers\r\nwould use οὔ.\r\n\r\n[743] Strabo and Curtius call this river Hyarotis.\r\n\r\n[744] The Brachmans, or Brahmins, were a religious caste of Indians.\r\nThe name was sometimes used for the people whose religion was\r\nBrahminism. Cf. Arrian (_Indica_, 11); _Strabo_, xv. 1; p. 713 ed.\r\n_Casaubon_.\r\n\r\n[745] Cf. _Arrian_ i. 11 supra.\r\n\r\n[746] The Romans called these men _duplicarii_. See _Livy_, ii. 59;\r\nvii. 37.\r\n\r\n[747] τοῖς ἔπειτα πυθέσθαι. Cf. Homer (_Iliad_, xxii. 305; ii. 119).\r\n\r\n[748] _Curtius_ (ix. 22) calls the physician Critobulus. Near the city\r\nof Cos stood the Asclepiēum, or temple of Asclepius, to whom the island\r\nwas sacred, and from whom the chief family, the Asclepiadae, claimed\r\ndescent. Curtius says:—Igitur patefacto latius vulnere, et spiculo\r\nevolso, ingens vis sanguinis manare coepit, linquique animo rex, et\r\ncaligine oculis offusa, veluti moribundus extendi.\r\n\r\n[749] Cf. Plutarch (_Alex._ 63); _Diodorus_ (xvii. 98, 99); _Curtius_\r\n(ix. 18-23); _Justin_ (xii. 9).\r\n\r\n[750] As to Fame, or Rumour, see Homer (_Iliad_, ii. 93; _Odyss._\r\nxxiv. 412); Hesiod (_Works and Days_, 758-762); Vergil (_Aeneid_, iv.\r\n173-190); Ovid (_Met._ xii. 39-63); Statius (_Theb._ ii. 426).\r\n\r\n[751] _Curtius_ (ix. 18) says it was the town of the Oxydracians.\r\n\r\n[752] Nearly 70 miles.\r\n\r\n[753] _Isthmus_ is from the same root as ἰέναι, _to go_, and thus means\r\na _passage_. Pindar (_Isthmia_, iv. 34) calls it the “bridge of the\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\n[754] We learn from _Curtius_ (ix. 21) that the authors who stated that\r\nPtolemy was present in this battle were Clitarchus and Timagenes. From\r\nthe history of the former, who was a contemporary of Alexander, Curtius\r\nmainly drew the materials for his history of Alexander.\r\n\r\n[755] Ptolemy received this appellation from the Rhodians whom he\r\nrelieved from the assaults of Demetrius. The grateful Rhodians paid him\r\ndivine honours as their preserver, and he was henceforward known as\r\nPtolemy Soter. B.C. 304. See _Pausanias_, i. 8, 6.\r\n\r\n[756] The word ἀταλαίπωρος is used in a similar\r\nway by _Thucydides_, i. 20, 4.\r\n\r\n[757] _Curtius_ (ix. 24) says that Craterus was deputed by the officers\r\nto make this representation to the king, and that he was backed up by\r\nPtolemy and the rest.\r\n\r\n[758] This line is a fragment from one of the lost tragedies of\r\nAeschўlus: δράσαντι γάρ τι καὶ παθεῖν ὀφείλεται.\r\n\r\n[759] _Curtius_ (ix. 23) says that he was cured of his wound in seven\r\ndays. _Diodorus_ (xvii. 99) says that it took many days.\r\n\r\n[760] Arrian does not mention the Sutledj, which is the fifth of the\r\nrivers of the Punjab. _Pliny_ (vi. 21) calls it Hesidrus; _Ptolemy_\r\n(vii. 1) calls it Zaradrus.\r\n\r\n[761] About 12 miles. Ita se findente Nilo ut triquetram terrae\r\nfiguram efficiat. Ideo multi Graecae literae vocabulo Delta appellavere\r\nAegyptum (_Pliny_, v. 9).\r\n\r\n[762] This tribe dwelt between the Acesines and the Indus. _Diodorus_\r\n(xvii. 102) calls them Sambastians; while _Curtius_ (ix. 30) calls them\r\nSabarcians. The Xathrians and Ossadians dwelt on the left bank of the\r\nIndus.\r\n\r\n[763] We find from _Curtius_ (ix. 31) and _Diodorus_ (xvii. 102) that\r\nthe name of this was Alexandria. It is probably the present Mittun.\r\n\r\n[764] _Curtius_ (ix. 31) calls this satrap Terioltes, and says he was\r\nput to death. His appointment as viceroy is mentioned by _Arrian_ (iv.\r\n22 supra).\r\n\r\n[765] This king is called Porticanus by _Curtius_ (ix. 31), _Diodorus_\r\n(xvii. 102), and _Strabo_ (xv. 1).\r\n\r\n[766] An expression imitated from _Thucydides_ (iv. 34). Cf. _Arrian_,\r\nii. 10; v. 19; where the same words are used of Darius and Porus.\r\n\r\n[767] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 102) says that Sambus escaped beyond the Indus\r\nwith thirty elephants.\r\n\r\n[768] See note, page 327 supra.\r\n\r\n[769] The _Indica_, a valuable work still existing. See chapters x. and\r\nxi. of that book.\r\n\r\n[770] These people inhabited the Delta of the Indus, which is now\r\ncalled Lower Scinde. Their capital, Patala, is the modern Tatta.\r\n\r\n[771] Cf. Arrian (_Indica_, ii.).\r\n\r\n[772] _Curtius_ (ix. 34) calls this king Moeris.\r\n\r\n[773] Aristobulus, as quoted by _Strabo_ (xv. 1), said that the voyage\r\ndown the Indus occupied ten months, the fleet arriving at Patala about\r\nthe time of the rising of Sirius, or July, 325 B.C.\r\n\r\n[774] The right arm of the Indus is now called the Buggaur, and the\r\nleft Sata.\r\n\r\n[775] _I.e._ caused a heavy swell of waters. Cf. _Apollonius Rhodius_,\r\nii. 595; _Polybius_, i. 60, 6. This wind was the south-west monsoon.\r\n\r\n[776] Cf. _Curtius_ (ix. 35, 36); Cæsar (_Bell. Gall._ iv. 29). τὰ\r\nσκάφη ἐμετεωρίζοντο. Arrian does not\r\ncomply with the Attic rule, that the plural neuter should take a verb\r\nin the singular. Compare ii. 20, 8; v. 17, 6 and 7; etc.\r\n\r\n[777] Plutarch (_Alex._ 66) says that Alexander called the island\r\nScillustis; but others called it Psiltucis. He also says that the\r\nvoyage down the rivers to the sea took seven months.\r\n\r\n[778] In regard to this expedition, see _Arrian_, vii. 20 infra.\r\n\r\n[779] About 200 miles. Arrian here follows the statement of Nearchus.\r\nAristobulus said that the distance was 1,000 stades. See _Strabo_, xv.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[780] See _Curtius_, ix. 38. This lake has disappeared.\r\n\r\n[781] These periodical winds are the southerly monsoon of the Indian\r\nOcean. Cf. Arrian (_Indica_, 21).\r\n\r\n[782] This occurs at the beginning of November. The Romans called the\r\nPleiades _Vergiliae_. Cf. _Pliny_ (ii. 47, 125): Vergiliarum occasus\r\nhiemem inchoat, quod tempus in III. Idus Novembres incidere consuevit.\r\nAlso _Livy_ (xxi. 35, 6): Nivis etiam casus, occidente jam sidere\r\nVergiliarum, ingentem terrorem adjecit.\r\n\r\n[783] This river, which is now called the Purally, is about 120\r\nmiles west of the mouth of the Indus. It is called Arabis by Arrian\r\n(_Indica_, 21); and Arbis by _Strabo_ (xv. 2).\r\n\r\n[784] These were a people of Gadrosia, inhabiting a coast district\r\nnearly 200 miles long in the present Beloochistan. Cf. Arrian\r\n(_Indica_, 22 and 25); _Pliny_, vi. 23.\r\n\r\n[785] The Arabitians dwelt between the Indus and the Arabius; the\r\nOritians were west of the latter river.\r\n\r\n[786] Rhambacia was probably at or near Haur.\r\n\r\n[787] According to _Diodorus_ (xvii. 104) the city was called\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\n[788] Ora was the name of the district inhabited by the Oritians.\r\n\r\n[789] Cf. Pliny (_Nat. Hist._ xii. 33-35).\r\n\r\n[790] Cf. _Strabo_ (xv. 2); Pliny (_Nat. Hist._ xii. 26).\r\n\r\n[791] Probably the snow-flake.\r\n\r\n[792] This is the well-known catechu, obtained chiefly from the Acacia\r\nCatechu. The liquid gum is called kuth or cutch in India.\r\n\r\n[793] These people were called Ichthyophagi, or Fish-eaters. They are\r\ndescribed by Arrian (_Indica_, 29); _Curtius_, ix. 40; _Diodorus_,\r\nxvii. 105; Pliny (_Nat. Hist._ vi. 25, 26); Plutarch (_Alex._\r\n66); _Strabo_, xv. 2. They occupied the sea-coast of Gadrosia, or\r\nBeloochistan. Cf. Alciphron (_Epistolae_, i. 1, 2).\r\n\r\n[794] A man of Callatis, a town on the Black Sea in Thrace, originally\r\ncolonized by the Milesians.\r\n\r\n[795] Cf. _Herodotus_, i. 193.\r\n\r\n[796] Pura was near the borders of Carmania, probably at Bampur. The\r\nname means _town_.\r\n\r\n[797] Cf. _Strabo_, xv. 2; _Diodorus_, ii. 19, 20. According to\r\nMegasthenes, Semiramis died before she could carry out her intended\r\ninvasion of India. See Arrian (_Indica_, 5). Neither Herodotus nor\r\nCtesias mentions an invasion of India by Cyrus; and according to Arrian\r\n(_Indica_, 9), the Indians expressly denied that Cyrus attacked them.\r\n\r\n[798] Strabo says that some of these marches extended 200, 400, and\r\neven 600 stades; most of the marching being done in the night. Krüger\r\nsubstitutes ξυμμέτρους for ξύμμετρος οὖσα.\r\n\r\n[799] Cf. _Thucydides_, ii. 49, 3.\r\n\r\n[800] Cf. Xenophon (_Anab._ vii. 5, 13); Homer (_Odyss._ vii. 283).\r\n\r\n[801] _Curtius_ (vii. 20) mentions a similar act of magnanimity as\r\nhaving occurred on the march in pursuit of Bessus through the desert\r\nto the river Oxus. Plutarch (_Alex._ 42) says it was when Alexander\r\nwas pursuing Darius; Frontinus (_Strategematica_, i. 7, 7) says it was\r\nin the desert of Africa; _Polyaenus_ (iv. 3, 25) relates the anecdote\r\nwithout specifying where the event occurred. μετεξέτεροι\r\nis an Ionic form very frequently used by Herodotus.\r\n\r\n[802] Compare note on page 146.\r\n\r\n[803] This man had been placed over the Oritians. See page 351 supra.\r\n\r\n[804] _Curtius_ (ix. 41) says that Craterus sent a messenger to the\r\nking, to say that he was holding in chains two Persian nobles, Ozines\r\nand Zeriaspes, who had been trying to effect a revolt.\r\n\r\n[805] The Areians were famed for their skill as professional mourners.\r\nSee Aeschўlus (_Choëphorae_, 423). For the origin of the name see\r\nDonaldson (_New Cratylus_, sect. 81.)\r\n\r\n[806] ἐξηλέγχθη is substituted by Sintenis for the common reading\r\nἐξηγγέλθη.\r\n\r\n[807] According to _Curtius_ (x. 1), Cleander and his colleagues\r\nwere not slain, but put into prison; whereas 600 of the soldiers who\r\nhad been the agents of their cruelty were put to death. Curtius says\r\nCleander was spared for having killed Parmenio with his own hand. Cf.\r\niii. 26 supra.\r\n\r\n[808] The _thriambus_ was a hymn to Bacchus, sung in festal processions\r\nin his honour. It was also used as a name of that deity, as we learn\r\nfrom _Diodorus_, iv. 5. It was afterwards used as synonymous with the\r\nRoman _triumphus_, by Polybius, Dionysius, and Plutarch.\r\n\r\n[809] The Bacchanalian procession through Carmania is described by\r\n_Curtius_ (ix. 42); Plutarch (_Alex._ 67); and _Diodorus_ (xvii. 106).\r\n\r\n[810] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 106) says that the port into which Nearchus put\r\nwas called Salmus.\r\n\r\n[811] ἐκπεριπλεύσοντα. The Attic future of πλέω is πλεύσομαι. πλέυσω is\r\nonly found in Polybius and the later writers.\r\n\r\n[812] See Arrian (_Indica_, 18-43).\r\n\r\n[813] The name for Persia and the Persians in the Hebrew Bible, is\r\nParas. Cyrus is called Koresh (the sun) in Hebrew; in the cuneiform\r\ninscriptions the name is Khurush. Cambyses is called Ahasuerus in\r\nEzra iv. 6; and Smerdis the Magian is the Artaxerxes who was induced\r\nby the Samaritans to forbid the further building of the temple (Ezra\r\niv. 7-24). The Ahasuerus of the Book of Esther is probably Xerxes.\r\nArtaxerxes the Long-handed was the patron of Ezra and Nehemiah (Ezra\r\nvii. 11-28; Neh. ii. 1-9, etc). “Darius the Persian,” mentioned in\r\nNeh. xii. 22, was probably Darius Codomannus, who was conquered by\r\nAlexander. The province of Susiana, previously called Elymais, appears\r\nin the Hebrew under the name of Eilam or Elam. Persis is still called\r\nFars.\r\n\r\n[814] B.C. 325.\r\n\r\n[815] Aria. See chap. 27 supra.\r\n\r\n[816] _Curtius_ (x. 4) says Orxines was descended from Cyrus.\r\n\r\n[817] See iii. 25 supra.\r\n\r\n[818] Cf. _Strabo_, xv. 3, where a description of this tomb is given,\r\nderived from Onesicritus, the pilot of Alexander. See Dean Blakesley’s\r\nnote on _Herodotus_ i. 214.\r\n\r\n[819] Just a few lines above, Arrian says that the couch was by the\r\nside of the coffin.\r\n\r\n[820] Cf. _Ammianus_, xxiii. 6, 32, 33. The Magi were the priests\r\nof the religion of Zoroaster, which was professed by the Medes and\r\nPersians. Their Bible was the Avesta, originally consisting of\r\ntwenty-one books, only one of which, the twentieth (Vendidad), is still\r\nextant.\r\n\r\n[821] See iii. 18 supra.\r\n\r\n[822] According to _Curtius_ (x. 4, 5) Orxines was not only innocent,\r\nbut was very devoted and attached to Alexander. The favourite eunuch,\r\nBagoas, poisoned the king’s mind against him, and suborned other\r\naccusers against him. He was condemned unheard.\r\n\r\n[823] Purpura et nitor corporis, ornatusque Persicus multo auro\r\nmultisque gemmis.—Cicero (_de Senectute_, 17).\r\n\r\n[824] Pasargadae was the ancient capital of Cyrus, but Persepolis\r\nwas that of the later kings of Persia. The tomb of Cyrus has been\r\ndiscovered at Murghab; consequently Parsagadae was on the banks of the\r\nriver Cyrus, N.E. of Persepolis. The latter city was at the junction of\r\nthe Araxes and Medus. Its extensive ruins are called Chel-Minar, “the\r\nforty columns.”\r\n\r\n[825] The Tigris rises in Armenia, and joins the Euphrates ninety miles\r\nfrom the sea, the united stream being then called Shat-el-Arab. In\r\nancient times the two rivers had distinct outlets. In the Hebrew the\r\nTigris is called Chiddekel, _i.e._ _arrow_. The Greek name Tigres is\r\nderived from the Zend _Tighra_, which comes from the Sanscrit _Tig_,\r\nto sharpen. Its present name is Dijleh. The respective lengths of the\r\nEuphrates and Tigris are 1,780 and 1,146 miles.\r\n\r\n[826] Among these were _Curtius_ (x. 3); _Diodorus_ (xviii. 4); and\r\nPlutarch (_Alex._, 68).\r\n\r\n[827] Gadeira or Gades was a Phoenician colony. The name is from the\r\nHebrew גָּדֵר, _a fence_. Cf. _Pliny_ (iv. 36); appellant Poeni\r\n_Gadir_ ita Punica lingua _septum_ significante. Also Avienus (_Ora\r\nMaritima_, 268): Punicorum lingua conseptum locum _Gaddir_ vocabat.\r\nAccording to _Pliny_ (v. 1), Suetonius Paulinus was the first Roman\r\ngeneral who crossed the Atlas Mountains.\r\n\r\n[828] See note 714, page 309.\r\n\r\n[829] Now called Capo di Leuca, the south-eastern point of Italy.\r\n\r\n[830] Cf. Arrian (_Indica_, 11).\r\n\r\n[831] Cf. Alciphron (_Epistolae_, i. 30, 1), with Bergler and Wagner’s\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n[832] This must have occurred B.C. 336. See Plutarch (_Alex._ 14);\r\nCicero (_Tusculanae Disputationes_, v. 32). Alexander said: “If I were\r\nnot Alexander, I should like to be Diogenes.” Cf. _Arrian_, i. 1;\r\nPlutarch (_de Fortit. Alex._, p. 331).\r\n\r\n[833] Cf. _Strabo_, xv. 1.\r\n\r\n[834] Strabo calls this sage Mandanis.\r\n\r\n[835] Strabo says, Alexander’s messengers summoned Mandanis to the son\r\nof Zeus.\r\n\r\n[836] Plutarch (_Alex._, 65) says this philosopher’s name was Sphines;\r\nbut the Greeks called him Calanus, because when he met them, instead\r\nof using the word χαῖρε greeting them, he said καλέ. The same author\r\nsays that he was persuaded to come to Alexander by Taxiles. See also\r\n_Strabo_ (xv. 1).\r\n\r\n[837] _Strabo_ (xv. 1) says that the voluntary death of Calanus\r\noccurred at Pasargadae; Aelian (_Varia Historia_, v. 6) says it was at\r\nBabylon; but _Diodorus_ (xvii. 107) says it happened at Susa, which\r\nstatement is confirmed by the fact of Nearchus being seemingly present.\r\n\r\n[838] Cf. Arrian (_Indica_, 10).\r\n\r\n[839] Cf. _Arrian_, vii. 13 infra; and _Herodotus_, vii. 40.\r\n\r\n[840] Cf. Cicero (_Tusc. Disput._ v. 27).\r\n\r\n[841] Media. See vi. 29 supra.\r\n\r\n[842] Oxathres was killed by Alexander himself with a sarissa, or long\r\nMacedonian pike. See Plutarch (_Alex._ 68), who calls him Oxyartes.\r\n\r\n[843] For this use of φθείρομαι, cf. Aristophanes (_Plutus_, 610);\r\n_Alciphron_, i. 13, 3; with Bergler’s note.\r\n\r\n[844] Cf. _Curtius_, x. 5.\r\n\r\n[845] She was also called Statira. See _Diodorus_, xvii. 107; Plutarch\r\n(_Alex._, 70). She is called Arsinoe by Photius.\r\n\r\n[846] “By these two marriages, Alexander thus engrafted himself upon\r\nthe two lines of antecedent Persian kings. Ochus was of the Achaemenid\r\nfamily, but Darius Codomannus, father of Statira, was not of that\r\nfamily; he began a new lineage. About the overweening regal state of\r\nAlexander, outdoing even the previous Persian kings, see _Pylarchus\r\napud Athenaeum_, xii. p. 539.”—_Grote._\r\n\r\n[847] See p. 242.\r\n\r\n[848] Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_, viii. 7). A copious account of this\r\ncelebrated marriage feast is given in _Athenæus_, xii. p. 538.\r\n\r\n[849] Cf. _Curtius_, x. 8.\r\n\r\n[850] About £4,600,000. _Justin_, xii. 11, agrees with Arrian; but\r\n_Diodorus_ (xvii. 109); Plutarch (_Alex._, 70); _Curtius_ (x. 8) say\r\n10,000 talents.\r\n\r\n[851] Cf. _Curtius_ (ix. 41); _Arrian_ (vi. 22) supra.\r\n\r\n[852] The Epigoni, or Afterborn, were the sons of the seven chiefs who\r\nfell in the first war against Thebes. See Herodotus, Pindar, Sophocles,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[853] For this _mesanculon_ see Gellius (_Noctes Atticae_, x. 25);\r\n_Polybius_, xxiii., 1, 9; Euripides (_Phoenissae_, 1141; _Andromache_,\r\n1133); _Alciphron_, iii. 36.\r\n\r\n[854] It was at this time that Harpalus, viceroy of Babylon, having\r\nsquandered a great deal of the treasure committed to his charge, became\r\nfrightened at the return of Alexander, and fled to Greece with 50,000\r\ntalents and 6,000 mercenary troops. See _Diodorus_, xvii. 108.\r\n\r\n[855] The Eulaeus is now called Kara Su. After joining the Coprates it\r\nwas called Pasitigris. It formerly discharged itself into the Persian\r\nGulf, but now into the Shat-el-Arab, as the united stream of the\r\nEuphrates and Tigris is now called. In Dan. viii. 2, 16, it is called\r\nUlai. Cf. _Pliny_, vi. 26, 31; xxxi. 21.\r\n\r\n[856] The Greeks and Romans sometimes speak of Mesopotamia as a part of\r\nSyria, and at other times they call it a part of Assyria. The Hebrew\r\nand native name of this country was Aram Naharaim, or “Syria of the two\r\nrivers.”\r\n\r\n[857] The Tigris now falls into the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n[858] Cf. _Arrian_, iii. 7, supra; _Curtius_, iv. 37.\r\n\r\n[859] Cf. _Strabo_, xvi. 1; _Herodotus_, i. 193; _Ammianus_, xxiv. 3,\r\n14.\r\n\r\n[860] Probably this city stood at the junction of the Tigris with the\r\nPhyscus, or Odorneh. See Xenophon (_Anab._ ii. 4, 25); _Herodotus_, i.\r\n189; _Strabo_, (xvi. 1) says that Alexander made the Tigris navigable\r\nup to Opis.\r\n\r\n[861] Cf. _Justin_ (xii. 11); _Diodorus_ (xvii. 109); _Curtius_ (x.\r\n10, 11). These authors put the punishment of the ringleaders after the\r\nspeech instead of before.\r\n\r\n[862] Thracians mean _mountaineers_; Hellenes, _warriors_; Dorians,\r\n_highlanders_; Ionians, _coast-men_; and Aeolians, _mixed men_. See\r\nDonaldson (_New Cratylus_, sect. 92).\r\n\r\n[863] The gold and silver mines at Mount Pangaeon near Philippi brought\r\nPhilip a yearly revenue of more than 1,000 talents (_Diodorus_, xvi.\r\n8). _Herodotus_ (v. 17) says that the silver mines at Mount Dysorum\r\nbrought a talent every day to Alexander, father of Amyntas.\r\n\r\n[864] This is a Demosthenic expression. See _De Falsa Legatione_, 92;\r\nand _I. Philippic_, 45.\r\n\r\n[865] B.C. 346.\r\n\r\n[866] He here refers to his own part in the victory of Chaeronea, B.C.\r\n336. See _Diodorus_, xvi. 86; Plutarch (_Alex._ 9).\r\n\r\n[867] This fact is attested by Demosthenes (_De Haloneso_, 12).\r\n\r\n[868] The Thebans under Pelopidas settled the affairs of Macedonia, and\r\ntook young Philip to Thebes as a hostage, B.C. 368.\r\n\r\n[869] About £122,000. Cf. Plutarch (_Alex._ 15); _Curtius_, x. 10.\r\n\r\n[870] Ἴων is the Hebrew Javan without the vowel points. In\r\nthe Persian name for the Greeks Ἰάονες, one of these\r\nvowels appear. See Aeschўlus (_Persae_, 178, 562).\r\n\r\n[871] Larger Phrygia formed the western part of the great central\r\ntable-land of Asia Minor. Smaller Phrygia was also called Hellespontine\r\nPhrygia, because it lay near the Hellespont. See _Strabo_, xii. 8.\r\n\r\n[872] A blue band worked with white, which went round the tiara of the\r\nPersian kings.\r\n\r\n[873] Cf. _Ammianus_, xxv. 4, 15: “(Julianus) id aliquoties praedicans,\r\nAlexandrum Magnum, ubi haberet thesauros interrogatum, apud amicos\r\nbenevole respondisse.”\r\n\r\n[874] Cf. _Arrian_, i. 16 supra.\r\n\r\n[875] It is supposed that the Saxones, _i.e._ Sacasuna, _sons of the\r\nSacae_, originated from this nation.\r\n\r\n[876] At the Persian court, kinsman was a title bestowed by the king\r\nas a mark of honour. Curtius says they were 15,000 in number. Cf.\r\n_Diodorus_, xvi. 50; Xenophon (_Cyropaedia_, i. 4, 27; ii. 2, 31).\r\n\r\n[877] As to this Persian custom, see Xenophon (_Agesilaus_, v. 4;\r\n_Cyropaedia_ i. 4, 27).\r\n\r\n[878] Cf. _Justin_, xii. 7; Plutarch (_Eumenes_, 16); _Curtius_, viii.\r\n17; _Livy_ xxxvii. 40; _Polybius_, v. 79, 4.\r\n\r\n[879] ἔμενον λιπαροῦντες. The more usual construction would be\r\nἐλιπάρουν μένοντες. Cf. _Herodotus_, ix. 45 (λιπαρέετε μένοντες); iii.\r\n51 (ἐλιπάρεε ἱστορέων)\r\n\r\n[880] The paean was sung, not only before and after battle, but\r\nalso after a banquet, as we see from this passage and from Xenophon\r\n(_Symposium_, ii. 1).\r\n\r\n[881] About £240.\r\n\r\n[882] Literally “with his own head,” an Homeric expression. We learn\r\nfrom Plutarch (_Eumenes_, 6), that Craterus was a great favourite with\r\nthe Macedonians because he opposed Alexander’s Asiatic innovations. See\r\nalso Plutarch (_Alexander_, 47); _Diodorus_, xvii. 114:—Κράτερον μὲν\r\nγὰρ εἶναι φιλοβασιλέα, Ἡφαιστίωνα δὲ φιλαλέξανδρον.\r\n\r\n[883] The use of κελεύειν with the dative, is in imitation of Homer.\r\nCf. i. 26, 3 supra.\r\n\r\n[884] We learn from Diodorus (xviii. 4) that when Alexander died,\r\nCraterus had got no farther than Cilicia on his return journey. He had\r\nwith him a paper of written instructions, among which were projects\r\nfor building an immense fleet in Phoenicia and the adjacent countries\r\nfor conveying an expedition against the Carthaginians and the other\r\nwestern nations as far as the pillars of Hercules; for the erection of\r\nmagnificent temples, and for the transportation of people from Europe\r\ninto Asia and from Asia into Europe. Alexander’s generals put these\r\nprojects aside, as too vast for any one but Alexander himself.\r\n\r\n[885] Cf. _Curtius_, x. 31.\r\n\r\n[886] The Greeks reckoned according to the lunar months, and therefore\r\nthey talked of ten months instead of nine as the period of gestation.\r\nCf. _Herodotus_, vi. 63; Aristophanes (_Thesmoph._ 742); Menander\r\n(_Plocion_, fragment 3); Plautus (_Cistell._ i. 3, 15); Terence\r\n(_Adelphi_, iii. 4, 29).\r\n\r\n[887] For this expression, cf. _Dion Cassius_, xlii. 57; Homer\r\n(_Iliad_, 23, 538); _Pausanias_, vii. 10, 2; _Herodotus_, viii. 104.\r\n\r\n[888] Here there is a gap in the manuscripts of Arrian, which probably\r\ncontained an account of the flight of Harpalus, the viceroy of Babylon,\r\nwith the treasures committed to his care, and also a description of the\r\ndispute between Hephaestion and Eumenes. See _Photius_ (codex 92).\r\n\r\n[889] Cf. Plutarch (_Eumenes_, 2).\r\n\r\n[890] The march was from Opis to Media, as we see from the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[891] Cf. _Herodotus_ (iii. 106; vii. 40); _Strabo_, xi. 7 and 14;\r\n_Diodor._ xvii. 110; _Ammianus_, xxiii. 6. Sir Henry Rawlinson says:\r\n“With Herodotus, who was most imperfectly acquainted with the geography\r\nof Media, originated the error of transferring to that province the\r\nNisea (Nesá) of Khorassan, and all later writers either copied or\r\nconfounded his statement. Strabo alone has escaped from the general\r\nconfusion. In his description we recognise the great grazing plains\r\nof Khawah, Alishtar, Huru, Silakhur, Burburud, Japalak, and Feridun,\r\nwhich thus stretch in a continuous line from one point to another\r\nalong the southern frontiers of Media.” Alexander probably visited the\r\nwesternmost of these pastures which stretch from Behistûn to Ispahan\r\nalong the mountain range. The form διαρπαγῆναι is\r\nused only by the later writers for διαρπασθῆναι.\r\n\r\n[892] Cf. _Strabo_, xi. 5; _Diodorus_, xvii. 77; _Curtius_, vi.\r\n19; _Justin_, xii. 3; _Arrian_, iv. 15; Homer (_Iliad_, iii. 189);\r\nAeschўlus (_Eumenides_, 655); Hippocrates (_De Aere, Aquis, et Locis_,\r\np. 553).\r\n\r\n[893] The queen is called Thalestris by Diodorus and Curtius.\r\n\r\n[894] This is a mistake, for Xenophon does mention the Amazons in\r\nthe _Anabasis_ (iv. 4, 16). For Trapezus and the Phasians see his\r\n_Anabasis_ (iv. 8, 22; v. 6, 36.)\r\n\r\n[895] See _Diodorus_, iv. 16. This was one of the twelve labours of\r\nHercules.\r\n\r\n[896] See Plutarch (_Theseus_, 26).\r\n\r\n[897] “The Battle of the Amazons” was a celebrated painting in the Stoa\r\nPoecile at Athens, executed by Micon, son of Phanichus, a contemporary\r\nof Polygnotus about B.C. 460. Cf. Aristophanes (_Lysistrata_, 678):\r\n“Look at the Amazons whom Micon painted on horseback fighting with the\r\nmen.” See also _Pausanias_ (i. 15; viii. 11).\r\n\r\n[898] Cf. _Herodotus_, iv. 110-117; ix. 27.\r\n\r\n[899] See Isocrates (_Panegyricus_, 19); Lysias (_Oratio Funebris_,\r\nnear the beginning).\r\n\r\n[900] _Strabo_ (xi. 5) declined to believe in the existence of the\r\nAmazons altogether. However, even Julius Cæsar spoke of them as having\r\nonce ruled over a large part of Asia. See Suetonius (_Life of Julius\r\nCæsar_, 22). Eustathius, on _Dionysius Periegetes_, p. 110, derives\r\nthe name _Amazones_ from ἀ, _not_, and μᾶζα, _barley-bread_:—διὸ καὶ\r\nἈμαζόνες ἐκαλοῦντο οἷα μὴ μάζαις ἀλλὰ κρέασι θηρίων ἐπιστρεφόμεναι.\r\nThis is not the usual derivation of the word.\r\n\r\n[901] Cf. Plutarch (_Alex._ 72); _Diodorus_ (xvii. 110).\r\n\r\n[902] Plutarch makes this statement.\r\n\r\n[903] See Homer (_Iliad_, xxiii. 141, 152); _Arrian_ (i. 12).\r\n\r\n[904] See _Herodotus_ (vii. 35). Xerxes means _the venerable king_. Cf.\r\n_Herod._, vi. 98. See Donaldson’s _New Cratylus_, sections 161, 479.\r\n\r\n[905] Epidaurus in Argolis was celebrated as the chief seat of the\r\nworship of Aesculapius.\r\n\r\n[906] This is an Homeric expression, meaning _myself_.\r\n\r\n[907] Equal to £2,300,000. Plutarch (_Alex._ 72) agrees with Arrian.\r\n_Diodorus_ (xvii. 115) and _Justin_ (xii. 12) say 12,000 talents.\r\n\r\n[908] Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_, vii. 8); _Diodorus_ (xvii. 114,\r\n115); Plutarch (_Alex._ 72, 75; _Eumenes_, 2; _Pelopidas_, 34).\r\n\r\n[909] See p. 392, note 888.\r\n\r\n[910] Cossaea was a district on the north-east of Susiana, which the\r\nPersian kings never subdued, but purchased the quiet of the inhabitants\r\nby paying them tribute. It is supposed to be the Cush of the Old\r\nTestament. _Diodorus_ (xvii. 111) says that Alexander completed his\r\nconquest of the Cossaeans in forty days. Plutarch (_Alex._ 72) says\r\nhe called the massacre of the Cossaeans his offering to the manes of\r\nHephaestion.\r\n\r\n[911] Cf. _Livy_, vii. 37, 38; _Pliny_, xxii. 4; _Justin_, xii. 13.\r\n\r\n[912] The Romans called these people Etruscans.\r\n\r\n[913] _Justin_ (xxi. 6) says that the Carthaginians sent Hamilcar to\r\nlearn Alexander’s real designs against them, under the pretence of\r\nbeing an exile offering his services.\r\n\r\n[914] Cf. _Diodorus_, xvii. 113.\r\n\r\n[915] Aristus was a man of Salamis in Cyprus. Neither his work nor that\r\nof Asclepiades is extant. Aristus is mentioned by _Athenæus_ (x. 10)\r\nand _Strabo_ (lib. xv.).\r\n\r\n[916] _Livy_ (ix. 18) says he does not think the contemporary Romans\r\neven knew Alexander by report.\r\n\r\n[917] These are what Hirtius (_Bell. Alex._ 11) calls “naves apertas et\r\nconstratas.”\r\n\r\n[918] See p. 155, note 392.\r\n\r\n[919] See p. 199, note 499. _Strabo_ (xi. 7) says that Aristobulus\r\ndeclared the Oxus to be the largest river which he had seen except\r\nthose in India.\r\n\r\n[920] See p. 198, note 498. The Oxus and Jaxartes really flow into the\r\nSea of Aral, or the Palus Oxiana, which was first noticed by _Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus_ (xxiii. 6, 59) in the 4th century A.D. Ptolemy, however,\r\nmentions it as a small lake, and not as the recipient of these rivers.\r\nCf. _Pliny_, vi. 18.\r\n\r\n[921] The Araxes, or Aras, joins the Cyrus, or Kour, and falls into\r\nthe Caspian Sea. It is now called Kizil-Ozan, or Red River. Its Hebrew\r\nname is Chabor (2 Kings xvii. 6). Pontem indignatus Araxes (Vergil,\r\n_Aeneid_, viii. 728). See Aeschўlus (_Prometheus_, 736), Dr. Paley’s\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n[922] As to the Chaldaeans, see Cicero (_De Div._, i. 1) and _Diod._\r\n(ii. 29-31).\r\n\r\n[923] This is a verse from one of the lost tragedies of Euripides.\r\nIt is also quoted by Cicero (_De Divin._, ii. 5): Est quidam Graecus\r\nvulgaris in hanc sententiam versus; bene qui conjiciet, vatem hunc\r\nperhibebo optimum.\r\n\r\n[924] See _Herodotus_ (i. 32); Plutarch (_Solon_, 27).\r\n\r\n[925] See p. 171, note 430. _Herodotus_ (i. 181) gives a description\r\nof this temple, which he says existed in his time. _Strabo_ (xvi.\r\n1) agrees with Arrian that it was said to have been destroyed by\r\nXerxes. He also says that Alexander employed 10,000 men in clearing\r\naway the rubbish of the ruins. Professor Sayce and others adduce this\r\npassage of Arrian to prove that Herodotus is not to be trusted even\r\nwhen he says he had seen the places and things which he describes.\r\nThe words of Herodotus are ἐς ἐμὲ τοῦτο ἔτι ἐόν, meaning, not that he\r\nhad himself seen the temple, but that it existed _till his time_. In\r\nchap. 183 he expressly states that he did not see other things which he\r\nis describing, but that he derived his information from the Chaldaeans.\r\nHe was about twenty years of age when Xerxes was assassinated. It must\r\nnot be forgotten that Strabo and Arrian lived five or six hundred\r\nyears after Xerxes. The veracity of Strabo is never doubted; yet in\r\nhis description of Babylon this author speaks of the walls and hanging\r\ngardens as if they were still in existence, though not expressly saying\r\nso.\r\n\r\n[926] Cf. _Arrian_, iii. 16 supra.\r\n\r\n[927] See _Arrian_, iii. 16 supra.\r\n\r\n[928] Cf. Philostratus (_Life of Apollonius_, viii. 7, 5).\r\n\r\n[929] Perdiccas was killed by his own troops at Memphis, B.C. 321. See\r\n_Diodorus_, xviii. 36.\r\n\r\n[930] The battle of Ipsus was fought B.C. 301. See Plutarch\r\n(_Demetrius_, 29).\r\n\r\n[931] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 113) says that embassies came from the\r\nCarthaginians, Liby-Phoenicians, Greeks, Macedonians, Illyrians,\r\nThracians, and Gauls.\r\n\r\n[932] Cf. _Arrian_, iii. 16 supra.\r\n\r\n[933] The name Athens is said to have been derived from the worship\r\nof Athena. See Euripides (_Ion_, 8): Πόλις τῆς χρυσολόγχου Παλλάδος\r\nκεκλημένη. Attica is ἀττική or ἀκτικὴ γῆ, the “promontory land.”\r\n\r\n[934] Clazomenae was an Ionian city on the Gulf of Smyrna, celebrated\r\nas the birthplace of Anaxagoras. It is now called Kelisman.\r\n\r\n[935] About £1,200,000.\r\n\r\n[936] The Hebrew name for Arabia is Arab (wilderness). In Gen. xxv. 6\r\nit is called the “East country,” and in Gen. xxix. 1 the “Land of the\r\nSons of the East.”\r\n\r\n[937] Cf. _Arrian_, v. 26; vii. 1 and 15 supra.\r\n\r\n[938] Cf. _Herodotus_, iii. 8.\r\n\r\n[939] Cf. _Herodotus_, ii. 40, 86; iii. 110-112; _Strabo_, xvi. 4;\r\nPliny (_Nat. Hist._ xii.).\r\n\r\n[940] About 17 miles.\r\n\r\n[941] One of the Sporades, west of Samos, now called Nikaria. Cf.\r\nHorace (_Carm._, iv. 2, 2) and Ovid (_Fasti_, iv. 28).\r\n\r\n[942] Called Tyrus by _Strabo_ (xvi. 3). It is now called Bahrein, and\r\nis celebrated for pearl fisheries.\r\n\r\n[943] A fragment of the work of Androsthenes descriptive of his voyage\r\nis preserved by _Athenæus_ (iii. p. 936).\r\n\r\n[944] Probably Ramses. Its ruins are at Abu-Kesheb.\r\n\r\n[945] Probably the projection now called Ras-al-Had.\r\n\r\n[946] Cf. Arrian (_Indica_, 32).\r\n\r\n[947] About 90 miles. This canal fell into the Persian Gulf at Teredon.\r\nNo trace of it now remains.\r\n\r\n[948] The Hebrew name for Armenia is Ararat (2 Kings xix. 37; Isa.\r\nxxxvii. 38; Jer. li. 27).\r\n\r\n[949] The country called Assyria by the Greeks is called Asshur (level)\r\nin Hebrew. In Gen. x. 11 the foundation of the Assyrian kingdom is\r\nascribed to Nimrod; for the verse ought to be translated: “He went\r\nforth from that land into Asshur.” Hence in Micah v. 6, Assyria is\r\ncalled the “land of Nimrod.”\r\n\r\n[950] The Hebrew name for Babylon is Babel, _i.e._ Bab-Bel, _court of\r\nBel_: porta vel aula, civitas Beli (_Winer_). In Jer. xxv. 26; li.\r\n41, it is called Sheshach, which Jewish commentators, followed by\r\nJerome, explain by the Canon Atbash, _i.e._ after the alphabet put\r\nin an inverted order. According to this rule the word Babel, which\r\nis the Hebrew name of Babylon, would be written Sheshach. Sir Henry\r\nRawlinson, however, says it was the name of a god after whom the city\r\nwas named; and the word has been found among the Assyrian inscriptions\r\nrepresenting a deity.\r\n\r\n[951] The perfect passive δεδόμημαι is equivalent to the Epic and Ionic\r\nform δέδμημαι.\r\n\r\n[952] σχεθῆναι.

Arrian (_Tactics_, 12, 11).\r\n\r\n[958] Cf. _Arrian_, p. 379, note 853.\r\n\r\n[959] We read in the speech of Demosthenes against Dionysiodorus\r\n(1285), that Cleomenes and his partisans enriched themselves by\r\nmonopolizing the exportation of corn from Egypt. Cf. _Arrian_, iii. 5\r\nsupra.\r\n\r\n[960] This island is mentioned by Homer (_Odyssey_, iv. 355). Alexander\r\nconstructed a mole seven stades long from the coast to the island, thus\r\nforming the two harbours of Alexandria. See _Strabo_, xvii. 1. The\r\nisland is chiefly famous for the lofty tower built upon it by Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, for a lighthouse. Cf. Cæsar (_De Bello Civili_, iii.\r\n112); _Ammianus_, xxii. 16.\r\n\r\n[961] Consult Lucian (_Calumniae non temere credendum_, 17).\r\n\r\n[962] After Alexander’s death Cleomenes was executed by Ptolemy, who\r\nreceived Egypt as his share of the great king’s dominions.\r\n\r\n[963] _I.e._ the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[964] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 116) and Plutarch (_Alex._, 73) say that he was\r\na bound prisoner. The latter says his name was Dionysius, and that he\r\nwas a Messenian.\r\n\r\n[965] Plutarch (_Alex._, 75) and _Justin_ (xii. 13) say that he gave a\r\nbanquet to Nearchus the admiral, and that, as he was leaving it, he was\r\ninvited to the revel by Medius the Thessalian. Cf. _Diodorus_, xvii.\r\n117.\r\n\r\n[966] We learn from _Athenæus_ (x. p. 434 B) that this Court Journal\r\nwas kept by the royal secretary, Eumenes, afterwards so famous, and by\r\nthe historian, Diodotus of Erythrae. As to the last days of Alexander,\r\ncf. Plutarch (_Alex._, 76, 77).\r\n\r\n[967] Cf. _Curtius_, ix. 23: Mos erat principibus amicorum et\r\ncustodibus corporis excubare ante praetorium, quotiens adversa regi\r\nvaletudo incidisset.\r\n\r\n[968] Serāpis, or more correctly Sarapis, was an Egyptian deity, whose\r\nworship was introduced into Greece in the time of the Ptolemies.\r\nHis worship was introduced into Rome, with that of Isis, in the\r\ntime of Sulla. _Strabo_ (xvii. 1) gives an account of his cultus in\r\nthe celebrated temple at Canobus. The Serapeum at Alexandria, which\r\ncontained the famous library, is described by _Ammianus_, xxii. 16.\r\n\r\n[969] _I.e._ the most valiant.\r\n\r\n[970] To decide who was to succeed to his power. Cf. _Curtius_, x. 14;\r\n_Diodorus_, xvii. 117; _Justin_, xii. 15.\r\n\r\n[971] Cf. _Curtius_, x. 31; _Diodorus_, xvii. 117, 118; _Justin_,\r\nxii. 13. Plutarch (_Alex._, 77) asserts that nothing was said about\r\nAlexander’s being poisoned, until six years after, when Olympias, the\r\nenemy of Antipater, set the charge afloat.\r\n\r\n[972] See _Arrian_, iv. 10 supra.\r\n\r\n[973] Cassander was afterwards king of Macedonia and Greece. He put\r\nOlympias, Roxana, and her son Alexander Aegus to death, and bribed\r\nPolysperchon to put Barsine and her son Hercules to death. He died of\r\ndropsy, B.C. 297.\r\n\r\n[974] Cf. _Pausanias_, xviii. 4; _Curtius_, x. 31; Plutarch (_Alex._,\r\n77). The ancients called the poison, “the water of Styx”; it was\r\nobtained from Nonacris in the north of Arcadia, near which the river\r\nStyx took its origin. _Justin_ (xii. 14) says: Cujus veneni tanta vis\r\nfuit, ut non aere, non ferro, non testa contineretur, nec aliter ferri\r\nnisi in ungula equi potuerit. Pliny (_Hist. Nat._, xxx. 53) says:\r\nUngulas tantum mularum repertas, neque aliam ullam materiam quae non\r\nperroderetur a veneno Stygis aquae, cum id dandum Alexandro magno\r\nAntipater mitteret, dignum memoria est, magna Aristotelis infamia\r\nexcogitatum.\r\n\r\n[975] _Diodorus_ (xvii. 117) states that after drinking freely,\r\nAlexander swallowed the contents of a large goblet, called the cup of\r\nHeracles, and was immediately seized with violent pain. This statement,\r\nhowever, is contradicted by Plutarch. It seems from the last injunction\r\nof Calanus, the Indian philosopher, that it was considered the right\r\nthing to drink to intoxication at the funeral of a friend. See Plutarch\r\n(_Alex._, 69).\r\n\r\n[976] June, 323 B.C.\r\n\r\n[977] Ptolemy took the embalmed body of Alexander to Egypt, and placed\r\nit in Memphis, but removed it a few years after to Alexandria. See\r\n_Curtius_, x. 31. Cf. Aelian (_Varia Historia_, xii. 64; xiii. 29).\r\n\r\n[978] Cf. _Diodorus_, xvii. 4; ἡ ὀξύτης τοῦ νεανίσκου.\r\n\r\n[979] Cf. _Curtius_, x. 18: Gloriae laudisque, ut justo major cupido,\r\nita ut juveni et in tantis admittenda rebus.\r\n\r\n[980] Plutarch (_Alex._, 28) attributes the same motive to Alexander\r\nin representing himself to be the son of Zeus. _Livy_ (ix. 18) says:\r\nReferre in tanto rege piget superbam mutationem vestis et desideratas\r\nhumi jacentium adulationes, etiam victis Macedonibus graves, nedum\r\nvictoribus; et foeda supplicia, et inter vinum et epula, caedes\r\namicorum et vanitatem ementiendae stirpis. Consult the whole of the\r\ninteresting passage in _Livy_, ix. 17-19. See also Aelian (_Varia\r\nHistoria_, ii. 19; v. 12; ix. 37).\r\n\r\n[981] Cf. _Herodotus_, vii. 41; _Arrian_, iii. 11 supra.\r\n\r\n[982] Xenophon (_Cyropaedia_, vii. 5, 85) says that the Persian\r\nEquals-in-Honour, or Peers, spent their time about the Court.\r\n\r\n[983] Cf. _Arrian_, iv. 14 supra; _Justin_, ix. 8; _Athenæus_, x. p.\r\n434 B; Aelian (_Varia Historia_, iii. 23; ix. 3; xii. 26).\r\n\r\n[984] Europe and Asia. Arrian reckoned Libya, or Africa, as a part of\r\nAsia. See iii. 30; v. 26; vii. 1.\r\n\r\n[985] Dr. Leonhard Schmitz says:—“Arrian is in this work one of\r\nthe most excellent writers of his time, above which he is raised by\r\nhis simplicity and his unbiassed judgment. Great as his merits thus\r\nare as an historian, they are yet surpassed by his excellence as an\r\nhistorical critic. His Anabasis is based upon the most trustworthy\r\nhistorians among the contemporaries of Alexander, such as Ptolemy,\r\nAristobulus, which two he chiefly followed, Diodotus of Erythrae,\r\nEumenes of Cardia, Nearchus of Crete, and Megasthenes; and his sound\r\njudgment as to who deserved credit, justly led him to reject such\r\nauthors as Onesicritus, Callisthenes, and others. No one at all\r\nacquainted with this work of Arrian’s can refuse his assent to the\r\nopinion of Photius (p. 73; comp. Lucian, _Alex._, 2), that Arrian\r\nwas the best among the numerous historians of Alexander. One of the\r\ngreat merits of the work, independent of those already mentioned, is\r\nthe clearness and distinctness with which he describes all military\r\nmovements and operations, the drawing up of the armies for battle, and\r\nthe conduct of battles and sieges. In all these respects the Anabasis\r\nis a masterly production, and Arrian shows that he himself possessed a\r\nthorough practical knowledge of military affairs. He seldom introduces\r\nspeeches, but wherever he does he shows a profound knowledge of man;\r\nand the speech of Alexander to his rebellious soldiers, and the reply\r\nof Coenus, as well as some other speeches, are masterly specimens of\r\noratory. Everything, moreover, which is not necessary to make his\r\nnarrative clear is carefully avoided.” See Smith’s _Dictionary of Greek\r\nand Roman Biography_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF PROPER
