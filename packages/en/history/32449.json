The work as published before, however, was\r\nalways, to its author's mind, unfinished, for the reason that a chapter\r\non household customs, which was necessary for the completion of the\r\nplan, had to be omitted because it could not be written in America.\r\n\r\nThis defect has now been remedied, and the chapter \"Within the Home\"\r\ncontains the supplementary matter necessary to complete the picture of a\r\nJapanese woman's life. In addition to this a thorough revision has been\r\nmade of the whole book, and the subjects discussed in each chapter have\r\nbeen brought up to date by means of notes in an Appendix. The reader\r\nwill find these notes referred to by asterisks in the text.\r\n\r\nFinally, a second supplementary chapter has been added, in which an\r\neffort has been made to analyze present conditions. From its nature,\r\nthis chapter is only a rapid survey of the progress of ten years. It is\r\nnot easy to write with judgment of conditions actually present. A little\r\nperspective is necessary to make sure that one sees things in their\r\nproper proportions. It is therefore with some hesitation that I offer to\r\nthe public the result of two years' experience of the present state of\r\naffairs. If subsequent events show that my observation has been\r\nincorrect, I can only say that what I have written has been the\r\n\"Thing-as-I-see-It,\" and does not lay claim to being the\r\n\"Thing-as-It-is.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing, I would thank once more the friends whose names appear in\r\nthe previous Preface, and would add to their number the names of Mr. H.\r\nSakurai and Mr. and Mrs. Seijiro Saito, who have rendered me valuable\r\naid in gathering material.\r\n\r\n                                          A. M. B.\r\n\r\nNEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT,\r\n   _November, 1902_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems necessary for a new author to give some excuse for her boldness\r\nin offering to the public another volume upon a subject already so well\r\nwritten up as Japan. In a field occupied by Griffis, Morse, Greey,\r\nLowell, and Rein, what unexplored corner can a woman hope to enter? This\r\nis the question that will be asked, and that accordingly the author must\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nWhile Japan as a whole has been closely studied, and while much and\r\nvaried information has been gathered about the country and its people,\r\none half of the population has been left entirely unnoticed, passed over\r\nwith brief mention, or altogether misunderstood. It is of this neglected\r\nhalf that I have written, in the hope that the whole fabric of Japanese\r\nsocial life will be better comprehended when the women of the country,\r\nand so the homes that they make, are better known and understood.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Japanese home-life is so little understood by foreigners,\r\neven by those who have lived long in Japan, is that the Japanese, under\r\nan appearance of frankness and candor, hides an impenetrable reserve in\r\nregard to all those personal concerns which he believes are not in the\r\nremotest degree the concerns of his foreign guest. Only life in the home\r\nitself can show what a Japanese home may be; and only by intimate\r\nassociation--such as no foreign man can ever hope to gain--with the\r\nJapanese ladies themselves can much be learned of the thoughts and daily\r\nlives of the best Japanese women.\r\n\r\nI have been peculiarly fortunate in having enjoyed the privilege of long\r\nand intimate friendship with a number of Japanese ladies, who have\r\nspoken with me as freely, and shown the details of their lives to me as\r\nopenly, as if bound by closest ties of kindred. Through them, and only\r\nthrough them, I have been enabled to study life from the point of view\r\nof the refined and intelligent Japanese women, and have found the study\r\nso interesting and instructive that I have felt impelled to offer to\r\nothers some part of what I have received through the aid of these\r\nfriends. I have, moreover, been encouraged in my work by reading, when\r\nit was already more than half completed, the following words from\r\nGriffis's \"Mikado's Empire:\"--\r\n\r\n\"The whole question of the position of Japanese women--in history,\r\nsocial life, education, employments, authorship, art, marriage,\r\nconcubinage, prostitution, benevolent labor, the ideals of literature,\r\npopular superstitions, etc.--discloses such a wide and fascinating field\r\nof inquiry that I wonder no one has as yet entered it.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing, I should say that this work is by no means entirely my own.\r\nIt is, in the first place, largely the result of the interchange of\r\nthought through many and long conversations with Japanese ladies upon\r\nthe topics herein treated. It has also been carefully revised and\r\ncriticised; and many valuable additions have been made to it by Miss Umé\r\nTsuda, teacher of English in the Peeresses' School in T[=o]ky[=o], and\r\nan old and intimate friend. Miss Tsuda is at present in this country, on\r\na two years' leave, for purposes of further study. She has, amid her\r\nmany duties as a student at Bryn Mawr College, given much time and\r\nthought to this work; and a large part of whatever value it may possess\r\nis due to her.\r\n\r\nI would say, too, that in the verification of dates, names, and\r\nhistorical incidents, I have relied altogether upon Griffis's \"Mikado's\r\nEmpire\" and Rein's \"Japan,\" knowing that those two authors represent the\r\nbest that has been done by foreigners in the field of Japanese history.\r\n\r\nThis work also owes much, not only to the suggestions and historical\r\naids contained in the \"Mikado's Empire,\" but to Mr. Griffis himself,\r\nfor his careful reading of my manuscript, and for his criticisms and\r\nsuggestions. No greater encouragement can be given to an inexperienced\r\nauthor than the helpful criticism of one who has already distinguished\r\nhimself in the same field of labor; and for just such friendly aid my\r\nwarmest thanks are due to Mr. Griffis.\r\n\r\n                                          A. M. B.\r\n\r\nHAMPTON, VA., _February, 1891_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE GIRLS AND WOMEN.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Japanese baby the beginning of life is not very different from\r\nits beginning to babies in the Western world. Its birth, whether it be\r\ngirl or boy, is the cause of much rejoicing. As boys alone can carry on\r\nthe family name and inherit titles and estates, they are considered of\r\nmore importance, but many parents' hearts are made glad by the addition\r\nof a daughter to the family circle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the event takes place, a special messenger is dispatched to\r\nnotify relatives and intimate friends, while formal letters of\r\nannouncement are sent to those less closely related. All persons thus\r\nnotified must make an early visit to the newcomer, in order to welcome\r\nit into the world, and must either take with them or send before them\r\nsome present. Toys, pieces of cotton, silk, or crêpe for the baby's\r\ndress are regarded as suitable; and everything must be accompanied by\r\nfish or eggs, for good luck. Where eggs are sent, they are neatly\r\narranged in a covered box, which may contain thirty, forty, or even one\r\nhundred eggs.[1] The baby, especially if it be the first one in a\r\nfamily, receives many presents in the first few weeks of its life, and\r\nat a certain time proper acknowledgment must be made and return presents\r\nsent. This is done when the baby is about thirty days old.\r\n\r\n[1] All presents in Japan must be wrapped in white paper, although,\r\nexcept for funerals, this paper must have some writing on it, and must\r\nbe tied with a peculiar red and white paper string, in which is inserted\r\nthe _noshi_, or bit of dried fish, daintily folded in a piece of colored\r\npaper, which is an indispensable accompaniment of every present.\r\n\r\nBoth baby and mother have a hard time of it for the first few weeks of\r\nits life. The baby is passed from hand to hand, fussed over, and talked\r\nto so much by the visitors that come in, that it must think this world a\r\ntrying place. The mother, too, is denied the rest and quiet she needs,\r\nand wears herself out in the excitement of seeing her friends, and the\r\nphysical exercise of going through, so far as possible, the ceremonious\r\nbows and salutations that etiquette prescribes.\r\n\r\nBefore the seventh day the baby receives its name.[2] There is no\r\nespecial ceremony connected with this, but the child's birth must be\r\nformally registered, together with its name, at the district office of\r\nregistration, and the household keep holiday in honor of the event. A\r\ncertain kind of rice, cooked with red beans, a festival dish denoting\r\ngood fortune, is usually partaken of by the family on the seventh day.\r\n\r\n[2] A child is rarely given the name of a living member of the family,\r\nor of any friend. The father's name, slightly modified, is frequently\r\ngiven to a son, and those of ancestors long ago dead are sometimes used.\r\nOne reason for this is probably the inconvenience of similar names in\r\nthe same family, and middle names, as a way of avoiding this difficulty,\r\nare unknown. The father usually names the child, but some friend or\r\npatron of the family may be asked to do it. Names of beautiful objects\r\nin nature, such as Plum, Snow, Sunshine, Lotos, Gold, are commonly used\r\nfor girls, while boys of the lower classes often rejoice in such\r\nappellations as Stone, Bear, Tiger, etc. To call a child after a person\r\nwould not be considered any especial compliment.[*3]\r\n\r\nThe next important event in the baby's life is the _miya mairi_, a\r\nceremony which corresponds roughly with our christening. On the\r\nthirtieth day after birth,[*4] the baby is taken for its first visit to\r\nthe temple. For this visit great preparations are made, and the baby is\r\ndressed in finest silk or crêpe, gayly figured,--garments made\r\nespecially for the occasion. Upon the dress appears in various places\r\nthe crest of the family, as on all ceremonial dresses, whether for young\r\nor old, for every Japanese family has its crest. Thus arrayed, and\r\naccompanied by members of the family, the young baby is carried to one\r\nof the Shinto temples, and there placed under the protection of the\r\npatron deity of the temple. This god, chosen from a great number of\r\nShinto deities, is supposed to become the special guardian of the child\r\nthrough life. Offerings are made to the god and to the priest, and a\r\nblessing is obtained; and the baby is thus formally placed under the\r\ncare of a special deity. This ceremony over, there is usually an\r\nentertainment of some kind at the home of the parents, especially if the\r\nfamily be one of high rank. Friends are invited, and if there are any\r\nwho have not as yet sent in presents, they may give them at this time.\r\n\r\nIt is usually on this day that the family send to their friends some\r\nacknowledgment of the presents received. This sometimes consists of the\r\nred bean rice, such as is prepared for the seventh day celebration, and\r\nsometimes of cakes of _mochi_, or rice paste. A letter of thanks usually\r\naccompanies the return present. If rice is sent, it is put in a handsome\r\nlacquered box, the box placed on a lacquered tray, and the whole covered\r\nwith a square of crêpe or silk, richly decorated. The box, the tray, and\r\nthe cover are of course returned, and, curious to say, the box must be\r\nreturned unwashed, as it would be very unlucky to send it back clean. A\r\npiece of Japanese paper must be slipped into the box after its contents\r\nhave been removed, and box and tray must be given back, just as they\r\nare, to the messenger. Sometimes a box of eggs, or a peculiar kind of\r\ndried fish, called _katsuobushi_, is sent with this present, when it is\r\ndesired to make an especially handsome return. When as many as fifty or\r\none hundred return presents of this kind are to be sent, it is no slight\r\ntax on the mistress of the house to see that no one is forgotten, and\r\nthat all is properly done. As special messengers are sent, a number of\r\nmen are sometimes kept busy for two or three days.\r\n\r\nAfter all these festivities, a quiet, undisturbed life begins for the\r\nbaby,--a life which is neither unpleasant nor unhealthful. It is not\r\njolted, rocked, or trotted to sleep; it is allowed to cry if it chooses,\r\nwithout anybody's supposing that the world will come to an end because\r\nof its crying; and its dress is loose and easily put on, so that very\r\nlittle time is spent in the tiresome process of dressing and undressing.\r\nUnder these conditions the baby thrives and grows strong and fat; learns\r\nto take life with some philosophy, even at a very early age; and is not\r\nsubject to fits of hysterical or passionate crying, brought on by much\r\njolting or trotting, or by the wearisome process of pinning, buttoning,\r\ntying of strings, and thrusting of arms into tight sleeves.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese baby's dress, though not as pretty as that of our babies,\r\nis in many ways much more sensible. It consists of as many wide-sleeved,\r\nstraight, silk, cotton, or flannel garments as the season of the year\r\nmay require,--all cut after nearly the same pattern, and that pattern\r\nthe same in shape as the grown-up _kimono_. These garments are fitted,\r\none inside of the other, before they are put on; then they are laid down\r\non the floor and the baby is laid into them; a soft belt, attached to\r\nthe outer garment or dress, is tied around the waist, and the baby is\r\ndressed without a shriek or a wail, as simply and easily as possible.\r\nThe baby's dresses, like those of our babies, are made long enough to\r\ncover the little bare feet; and the sleeves cover the hands as well, so\r\npreventing the unmerciful scratching that most babies give to their\r\nfaces, as well as keeping the hands warm and dry.\r\n\r\nBabies of the lower classes, within a few weeks after birth, are carried\r\nabout tied upon the back of some member of the family, frequently an\r\nolder sister or brother, who is sometimes not more than five or six\r\nyears old. The poorer the family, the earlier is the young baby thus put\r\non some one's back, and one frequently sees babies not more than a month\r\nold, with bobbing heads and blinking eyes, tied by long bands of cloth\r\nto the backs of older brothers or sisters, and living in the streets in\r\nall weathers. When it is cold, the sister's _haori_, or coat, serves as\r\nan extra covering for the baby as well; and when the sun is hot, the\r\nsister's parasol keeps off its rays from the bobbing bald head.[*8]\r\nLiving in public, as the Japanese babies do, they soon acquire an\r\nintelligent, interested look, and seem to enjoy the games of the elder\r\nchildren, upon whose backs they are carried, as much as the players\r\nthemselves. Babies of the middle classes do not live in public in this\r\nway, but ride about upon the backs of their nurses until they are old\r\nenough to toddle by themselves, and they are not so often seen in the\r\nstreets; as few but the poorest Japanese, even in the large cities, are\r\nunable to have a pleasant bit of garden in which the children can play\r\nand take the air. The children of the richest families, the nobility,\r\nand the imperial family, are never carried about in this way. The young\r\nchild is borne in the arms of an attendant, within doors and without;\r\nbut as this requires the care of some one constantly, and prevents the\r\nnurse from doing anything but care for the child, only the richest can\r\nafford this luxury. With the baby tied to her back, a woman is able to\r\ncare for a child, and yet go on with her household labors, and baby\r\nwatches over mother's or nurse's shoulder, between naps taken at all\r\nhours, the processes of drawing water, washing and cooking rice, and all\r\nthe varied work of the house. Imperial babies are held in the arms of\r\nsome one night and day, from the moment of birth until they have learned\r\nto walk, a custom which seems to render the lot of the high-born infant\r\nless comfortable in some ways than that of the plebeian child.\r\n\r\nThe flexibility of the knees, which is required for comfort in the\r\nJapanese method of sitting, is gained in very early youth by the habit\r\nof setting a baby down with its knees bent under it, instead of with its\r\nlegs out straight before it, as seems to us the natural way. To the\r\nJapanese, the normal way for a baby to sit is with its knees bent under\r\nit, and so, at a very early age, the muscles and tendons of the knees\r\nare accustomed to what seems to us a most unnatural and uncomfortable\r\nposture.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] That the position of the Japanese in sitting is really unnatural and\r\nunhygienic, is shown by recent measurements taken by the surgeons of the\r\nJapanese army. These measurements prove that the small stature of the\r\nJapanese is due largely to the shortness of the lower limbs, which are\r\nout of proportion to the rest of the body. The sitting from early\r\nchildhood upon the legs bent at the knee, arrests the development of\r\nthat part of the body, and produces an actual deformity in the whole\r\nnation. This deformity is less noticeable among the peasants, who stand\r\nand walk so much as to secure proper development of the legs; but among\r\nmerchants, literary men, and others of sedentary habits, it is most\r\nplainly to be seen. The introduction of chairs and tables, as a\r\nnecessary adjunct of Japanese home life, would doubtless in time alter\r\nthe physique of the Japanese as a people.\r\n\r\nAmong the lower classes, where there are few bathing facilities in the\r\nhouses, babies of a few weeks old are often taken to the public bath\r\nhouse and put into the hot bath. These Japanese baths are usually heated\r\nto a temperature of a hundred to a hundred and twenty Fahrenheit,--a\r\ntemperature that most foreigners visiting Japan find almost unbearable.\r\nTo a baby's delicate skin, the first bath or two is usually a severe\r\ntrial, but it soon becomes accustomed to the high temperature, and takes\r\nits bath, as it does everything else, placidly and in public. Born into\r\na country where cow's milk is never used, the Japanese baby is wholly\r\ndependent upon its mother for milk,[4] and is not weaned entirely until\r\nit reaches the age of three or four years, and is able to live upon the\r\nordinary food of the class to which it belongs. There is no intermediate\r\nstage of bread and milk, oatmeal and milk, gruel, or pap of some kind;\r\nfor the all-important factor--milk--is absent from the bill of fare, in\r\na land where there is neither \"milk for babes\" nor \"strong meat for them\r\nthat are full of age.\"\r\n\r\n[4] Sometimes, in the old days, rice water was given to babies instead\r\nof milk, but it was nearly impossible to bring up a baby on this alone.\r\nNow both fresh and condensed milk are used, where the mother's milk is\r\ninsufficient, but only in those parts of Japan where the foreign\r\ninfluence is felt.[*11]\r\n\r\nIn consequence, partly, of the lack of proper nourishment after the\r\nchild is too old to live wholly upon its mother's milk, and partly,\r\nperhaps, because of the poor food that the mothers, even of the higher\r\nclasses, live upon, many babies in Japan are afflicted with disagreeable\r\nskin troubles, especially of the scalp and face,--troubles which usually\r\ndisappear as soon as the child becomes accustomed to the regular food of\r\nthe adult. Another consequence, as I imagine, of the lack of proper\r\nfood at the teething period, is the early loss of the child's first\r\nteeth, which usually turn black and decay some time before the second\r\nteeth begin to show themselves. With the exception of these two\r\ntroubles, Japanese babies seem healthy, hearty, and happy to an\r\nextraordinary degree, and show that most of the conditions of their\r\nlives are wholesome. The constant out-of-door life and the healthful\r\ndress serve to make up in considerable measure for the poor food, and\r\nthe Japanese baby, though small after the manner of the race, is usually\r\nplump, and of firm, hard flesh. One striking characteristic of the\r\nJapanese baby is, that at a very early age it learns to cling like a\r\nkitten to the back of whoever carries it, so that it is really difficult\r\nto drop it through carelessness, for the baby looks out for its own\r\nsafety like a young monkey. The straps that tie it to the back are\r\nsufficient for safety; but the baby, from the age of one month, is\r\ndependent upon its own exertions to secure a comfortable position, and\r\nit soon learns to ride its bearer with considerable skill, instead of\r\nbeing merely a bundle tied to the shoulders. Any one who has ever\r\nhandled a Japanese baby can testify to the amount of intelligence shown\r\nin this direction at a very early age; and this clinging with arms and\r\nlegs is, perhaps, a valuable part of the training which gives to the\r\nwhole nation the peculiar quickness of motion and hardness of muscle\r\nthat characterize them from childhood. It is the agility and muscular\r\nquality that belong to wild animals, that we see something of in the\r\nIndian, but to a more marked degree in the Japanese, especially of the\r\nlower classes.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese baby's first lessons in walking are taken under favorable\r\ncircumstances. With feet comfortably shod in the soft _tabi_, or\r\nmitten-like sock, babies can tumble about as they like, with no bump nor\r\nbruise, upon the soft matted floors of the dwelling houses. There is no\r\nfurniture to fall against, and nothing about the room to render falling\r\na thing to be feared. After learning the art of walking in the house,\r\nthe baby's first attempts out of doors are hampered by the _zori_ or\r\n_géta_,--a light straw sandal or small wooden clog attached to the foot\r\nby a strap passing between the toes. At the very beginning the sandal\r\nor clog is tied to the baby's foot by bits of string fastened around the\r\nankle, but this provision for security is soon discarded, and the baby\r\npatters along like the grown people, holding on the _géta_ by the strap\r\npassing between the toes. This somewhat cumbersome and inconvenient foot\r\ngear must cause many falls at first, but baby's experience in the art of\r\nbalancing upon people's backs now aids in this new art of balancing upon\r\nthe little wooden clogs. Babies of two or three trot about quite\r\ncomfortably in _géta_ that seem to give most insecure footing, and older\r\nchildren run, jump, hop on one foot, and play all manner of active games\r\nupon heavy clogs that would wrench our ankles and toes out of all\r\npossibility of usefulness. This foot gear, while producing an awkward,\r\nshuffling gait, has certain advantages over our own, especially for\r\nchildren whose feet are growing rapidly. The _géta_, even if outgrown,\r\ncan never cramp the toes nor compress the ankles. If the foot is too\r\nlong for the clog the heel laps over behind, but the toes do not suffer,\r\nand the use of the _géta_ strengthens the ankles by affording no\r\nartificial aid or support, and giving to all the muscles of foot and\r\nleg free play, with the foot in a natural position. The toes of the\r\nJapanese retain their prehensile qualities to a surprising degree, and\r\nare used, not only for grasping the foot gear, but among mechanics\r\nalmost like two supplementary hands, to aid in holding the thing worked\r\nupon. Each toe knows its work and does it, and they are not reduced to\r\nthe dull uniformity of motion that characterizes the toes of a\r\nleather-shod nation.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the dress of the boy and the girl, that one\r\nnotices from childhood, begins in babyhood. A very young baby wears red\r\nand yellow, but soon the boy is dressed in sober colors,--blues, grays,\r\ngreens, and browns; while the little girl still wears the most gorgeous\r\nof colors and the largest of patterns in her garments, red being the\r\npredominant hue. The sex, even of a young baby, may be distinguished by\r\nthe color of its clothing. White, the garb of mourning in Japan, is\r\nnever used for children, but the minutest babies are dressed in\r\nbright-colored garments, and of the same materials--wadded cotton, silk,\r\nor crêpe--as those worn by adults of their social grade. As these\r\ndresses are not as easily washed as our own cambric and flannel baby\r\nclothes, there is a loss among the poorer classes in the matter of\r\ncleanliness; and the gorgeous soiled gowns are not as attractive as the\r\nmore washable white garments in which our babies are dressed. For model\r\nclothing for a baby, I would suggest a combination of the Japanese style\r\nwith the foreign, easily washed materials,--a combination that I have\r\nseen used in their own families by Japanese ladies educated abroad, and\r\none in which the objections to the Japanese style of dress are entirely\r\nobviated.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese baby begins to practice the accomplishment of talking at a\r\nvery early age, for its native language is singularly happy in easy\r\nexpressions for children; and little babies will be heard chattering\r\naway in soft, easily spoken words long before they are able to venture\r\nalone from their perches on their mothers' or nurses' backs. A few\r\nsimple words express much, and cover all wants. _Iya_ expresses\r\ndiscontent or dislike of any kind, and is also used for \"no\"; _mam ma_\r\nmeans food; _bé bé_ is the dress; _ta ta_ is the sock, or house shoe,\r\netc. We find many of the same sounds as in the baby language of\r\nEnglish, with meanings totally different. The baby is not troubled with\r\ndifficult grammatical changes, for the Japanese language has few\r\ninflections; and it is too young to be puzzled with the intricacies of\r\nthe various expressions denoting different degrees of politeness, which\r\nare the snare and the despair of the foreigner studying Japanese.\r\n\r\nAs our little girl emerges from babyhood she finds the life opening\r\nbefore her a bright and happy one, but one hedged about closely by the\r\nproprieties, and one in which, from babyhood to old age, she must expect\r\nto be always under the control of one of the stronger sex. Her position\r\nwill be an honorable and respected one only as she learns in her youth\r\nthe lesson of cheerful obedience, of pleasing manners, and of personal\r\ncleanliness and neatness. Her duties must be always either within the\r\nhouse, or, if she belongs to the peasant class, on the farm. There is no\r\ncareer or vocation open to her: she must be dependent always upon either\r\nfather, husband, or son, and her greatest happiness is to be gained, not\r\nby cultivation of the intellect, but by the early acquisition of the\r\nself-control which is expected of all Japanese women to an even greater\r\ndegree than of the men. This self-control must consist, not simply in\r\nthe concealment of all the outward signs of any disagreeable\r\nemotion,--whether of grief, anger, or pain,--but in the assumption of a\r\ncheerful smile and agreeable manner under even the most distressing of\r\ncircumstances. The duty of self-restraint is taught to the little girls\r\nof the family from the tenderest years; it is their great moral lesson,\r\nand is expatiated upon at all times by their elders. The little girl\r\nmust sink herself entirely, must give up always to others, must never\r\nshow emotions except such as will be pleasing to those about her: this\r\nis the secret of true politeness, and must be mastered if the woman\r\nwishes to be well thought of and to lead a happy life. The effect of\r\nthis teaching is seen in the attractive but dignified manners of the\r\nJapanese women, and even of the very little girls. They are not forward\r\nnor pushing, neither are they awkwardly bashful; there is no\r\nself-consciousness, neither is there any lack of _savoir faire_; a\r\nchildlike simplicity is united with a womanly consideration for the\r\ncomfort of those around them. A Japanese child seems to be the product\r\nof a more perfect civilization than our own, for it comes into the world\r\nwith little of the savagery and barbarian bad manners that distinguish\r\nchildren in this country, and the first ten or fifteen years of its life\r\ndo not seem to be passed in one long struggle to acquire a coating of\r\ngood manners that will help to render it less obnoxious in polite\r\nsociety. How much of the politeness of the Japanese is the result of\r\ntraining, and how much is inherited from generations of civilized\r\nancestors, it is difficult to tell; but my impression is, that babies\r\nare born into the world with a good start in the matter of manners, and\r\nthat the uniformly gentle and courteous treatment that they receive from\r\nthose about them, together with the continual verbal teaching of the\r\nprinciple of self-restraint and thoughtfulness of others, produce with\r\nvery little difficulty the universally attractive manners of the people.\r\nOne curious thing in a Japanese household is to see the formalities that\r\npass between brothers and sisters, and the respect paid to age by every\r\nmember of the family. The grandfather and grandmother come first of all\r\nin everything,--no one at table must be helped before them in any case;\r\nafter them come the father and mother; and lastly, the children\r\naccording to their ages. A younger sister must always wait for the elder\r\nand pay her due respect, even in the matter of walking into the room\r\nbefore her. The wishes and convenience of the elder, rather than of the\r\nyounger, are to be consulted in everything, and this lesson must be\r\nlearned early by children. The difference in years may be slight, but\r\nthe elder-born has the first right in all cases.\r\n\r\nOur little girl's place in the family is a pleasant one: she is the pet\r\nand plaything of father and elder brothers, and she is never saluted by\r\nany one in the family, except her parents, without the title of respect\r\ndue to her position. If she is the eldest daughter, to the servants she\r\nis _O J[=o] Sama_, literally, young lady; to her own brothers and sisters,\r\n_Né San_, elder sister. Should she be one of the younger ones, her given\r\nname, preceded by the honorific _O_ and followed by _San_, meaning Miss,\r\nwill be the name by which she will be called by younger brothers and\r\nsisters, and by the servants. As she passes from babyhood to girlhood,\r\nand from girlhood to womanhood, she is the object of much love and care\r\nand solicitude; but she does not grow up irresponsible or untrained to\r\nmeet the duties which womanhood will surely bring to her. She must learn\r\nall the duties that fall upon the wife and mother of a Japanese\r\nhousehold, as well as obtain the instruction in books and mathematics\r\nthat is coming to be more and more a necessity for the women of Japan.\r\nShe must take a certain responsibility in the household; must see that\r\ntea is made for the guests who may be received by her parents,--in all\r\nbut the families of highest rank, must serve it herself. Indeed, it is\r\nquite the custom in families of the higher classes, should a guest, whom\r\nit is desired to receive with especial honor, dine at the house, to\r\nserve the meal, not with the family, but separately for the father and\r\nhis visitor; and it is the duty of the wife or daughter, oftener the\r\nlatter, to wait on them. This is in honor of the guest, not on account\r\nof the lack of servants, for there may be any number of them within\r\ncall, or even in the back part of the room, ready to receive from the\r\nhands of the young girl what she has removed. She must, therefore, know\r\nthe proper etiquette of the table, how to serve carefully and neatly,\r\nand, above all, have the skill to ply the _saké_ bottle, so that the\r\nhouse may keep up its reputation for hospitality. Should guests arrive\r\nin the absence of her parents, she must receive and entertain them until\r\nthe master or mistress of the house returns. She also feels a certain\r\ncare about the behavior of the younger members of the family, especially\r\nin the absence of the parents. In these various ways she is trained for\r\ntaking upon herself the cares of a household when the time comes. In all\r\nbut the very wealthiest and most aristocratic families, the daughters of\r\nthe house do a large part of the simple housework. In a house with no\r\nfurniture, no carpets, no bric-à-brac, no mirrors, picture frames or\r\nglasses to be cared for, no stoves or furnaces, no windows to wash, a\r\nlarge part of the cooking to be done outside, and no latest styles to be\r\nimitated in clothing, the amount of work to be done by women is\r\nconsiderably diminished, but still there remains enough to take a good\r\ndeal of time. Every morning there are the beds to be rolled up and\r\nstored away in the closet, the mosquito nets to be taken down, the rooms\r\nto be swept, dusted, and aired before breakfast. Besides this, there is\r\nthe washing and polishing of the _engawa_, or piazza, which runs around\r\nthe outside of a Japanese house between the _shoji_, or paper screens\r\nthat serve as windows, and the _amado_, or sliding shutters, that are\r\nclosed only at night, or during heavy, driving rains. Breakfast is to be\r\ncooked and served, dishes to be washed (in cold water); and then perhaps\r\nthere is marketing to be done, either at shops outside or from the\r\nvendors of fish and vegetables who bring their huge baskets of\r\nprovisions to the door; but after these duties are performed, it is\r\npossible to sit down quietly to the day's work of sewing, studying, or\r\nwhatever else may suit the taste or necessities of the housewife. Of\r\nsewing there is always a good deal to be done, for many Japanese dresses\r\nmust be taken to pieces whenever they are washed, and are turned, dyed,\r\nand made over again and again, so long as there is a shred of the\r\noriginal material left to work upon. There is washing, too, to be done,\r\nalthough neither with hot water nor soap; and in the place of ironing,\r\nthe cotton garments, which are usually washed without ripping, must be\r\nhung up on a bamboo pole passed through the armholes, and pulled smooth\r\nand straight before they dry; and the silk, always ripped into breadths\r\nbefore washing, must be smoothed while wet upon a board which is set in\r\nthe sun until the silk is dry.\r\n\r\nThen there are the every day dishes which our Japanese maiden must learn\r\nto prepare. The proper boiling of rice is in itself a study. The\r\nconstruction of the various soups which form the staple in the Japanese\r\nbill of fare; the preparation of _mochi_, a kind of rice dough, which is\r\nprepared at the New Year, or to send to friends on various festival\r\noccasions: these and many other branches of the culinary art must be\r\nmastered before the young girl is prepared to assume the cares of\r\nmarried life.\r\n\r\nBut though the little girl's life is not without its duties and\r\nresponsibilities, it is also not at all lacking in simple and innocent\r\npleasures.[*24] First among the annual festivals, and bringing with it\r\nmuch mirth and frolic, comes the Feast of the New Year. At this time\r\nfather, mother, and all older members of the family lay aside their work\r\nand their dignity, and join in the fun and sports that are\r\ncharacteristic of this season. Worries and anxieties are set aside with\r\nthe close of the year, and the first beams of the New Year's sun bring\r\nin a season of unlimited joy for the children. For about one week the\r\nfestival lasts, and the festal spirit remains through the whole month,\r\nprompting to fun and amusements of all kinds. From early morning until\r\nbedtime the children wear their prettiest clothes, in which they play\r\nwithout rebuke. Guests come and go, bringing congratulations to the\r\nfamily, and often gifts for all. The children's stock of toys is thus\r\ngreatly increased, and the house overflows with the good things of the\r\nseason, of which _mochi_, or cake made from rice dough, prepared always\r\nespecially for this time, is one of the most important articles.\r\n\r\nThe children are taken with their parents to make New Year's visits to\r\ntheir friends and to offer them congratulations, and much they enjoy\r\nthis, as, dressed in their best, they ride from house to house in\r\n_jinrikishas_.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] _Jinrikisha_, or _kuruma_, a small, light carriage, usually with a\r\nbroad top, which is drawn by a man. The _jinrikisha_ is the commonest of\r\nall vehicles now in use in Japan. _Jinrikisha_-man and _kurumaya_ are\r\nterms commonly used for the runner who draws the carriage.\r\n\r\nAnd then, during the long, happy evenings, the whole family, including\r\neven the old grandfather and grandmother, join in merry games; the\r\nservants, too, are invited to join the family party, and, without\r\nseeming forward or out of place, enter into the games with zest. One of\r\nthe favorite games is \"_Hyaku nin isshu_,\" literally \"The poems of a\r\nhundred poets.\" It consists of two hundred cards, on each of which is\r\nprinted either the first or last half of one of the hundred famous\r\nJapanese poems which give the name to the game. The poems are well known\r\nto all Japanese, of whatever sort or condition. All Japanese poems are\r\nshort, containing only thirty-one syllables, and have a natural division\r\ninto two parts. The one hundred cards containing the latter halves of\r\nthe poems are dealt and laid out in rows, face upward, before the\r\nplayers. One person is appointed reader. To him are given the remaining\r\nhundred cards, and he reads the beginnings of the poems in whatever\r\norder they come from the shuffled pack. Skill in the game consists in\r\nremembering quickly the line following the one read, and rapidly finding\r\nthe card on which it is written. Especially does the player watch his\r\nown cards, and if he finds there the end of the poem, the beginning of\r\nwhich has just been read, he must pick it up before any one sees it and\r\nlay it aside. If some one else spies the card first, he seizes it and\r\ngives to the careless player several cards from his own hand. Whoever\r\nfirst disposes of all his cards is the winner. The players usually\r\narrange themselves in two lines down the middle of the room, and the two\r\nsides play against each other, the game not being ended until either one\r\nside or the other has disposed of all its cards. The game requires great\r\nquickness of thought and of motion, and is invaluable in giving to all\r\nyoung people an education in the classical poetry of their own nation,\r\nas well as being a source of great merriment and jollity among young and\r\nold.\r\n\r\nScattered throughout the year are various flower festivals, when, often\r\nwith her whole family, our little girl visits the famous gardens where\r\nthe plum, the cherry, the chrysanthemum, the iris, or the azalea attain\r\ntheir greatest loveliness, and spends the day out of doors in æsthetic\r\nenjoyment of the beauties of nature supplemented by art. And then there\r\nis the feast most loved in the whole year, the Feast of Dolls, when on\r\nthe third day of the third month the great fire-proof storehouse gives\r\nforth its treasures of dolls,--in an old family, many of them hundreds\r\nof years old,--and for three days, with all their belongings of tiny\r\nfurnishings in silver, lacquer, and porcelain, they reign supreme,\r\narranged on red-covered shelves in the finest room of the house. Most\r\nprominent among the dolls are the effigies of the Emperor and Empress in\r\nantique court costume, seated in dignified calm, each on a lacquered\r\ndais. Near them are the figures of the five court musicians in their\r\nrobes of office, each with his instrument. Beside these dolls, which are\r\nalways present and form the central figures at the feast, numerous\r\nothers, more plebeian, but more lovable, find places on the lower\r\nshelves, and the array of dolls' furnishings which is brought out on\r\nthese occasions is something marvelous. It was my privilege to be\r\npresent at the Feast of Dolls in the house of one of the _Tokugawa\r\ndaimi[=o]s_, a house in which the old forms and ceremonies were strictly\r\nobserved, and over which the wave of foreign innovation had passed so\r\nslightly that even the calendar still remained unchanged, and the feast\r\ntook place upon the third day of the third month of the old Japanese\r\nyear, instead of on the third day of March, which is the usual time for\r\nit now. At this house, where the dolls had been accumulating for\r\nhundreds of years, five or six broad, red-covered shelves, perhaps\r\ntwenty feet long or more, were completely filled with them and with\r\ntheir belongings. The Emperor and Empress appeared again and again, as\r\nwell as the five court musicians, and the tiny furnishings and utensils\r\nwere wonderfully costly and beautiful. Before each Emperor and Empress\r\nwas set an elegant lacquered table service,--tray, bowls, cups, _saké_\r\npots, rice buckets, etc., all complete; and in each utensil was placed\r\nthe appropriate variety of food. The _saké_ used on this occasion is a\r\nsweet, white liquor, brewed especially for this feast, as different from\r\nthe ordinary _saké_ as sweet cider is from the hard cider upon which a\r\nman may drink himself into a state of intoxication.[*30] Besides the\r\ntable service, everything that an imperial doll can be expected to need\r\nor desire is placed upon the shelves. Lacquered _norimono_, or\r\npalanquins; lacquered bullock carts, drawn by bow-legged black\r\nbulls,--these were the conveyances of the great in Old Japan, and these,\r\nin minute reproductions, are placed upon the red-covered shelves. Tiny\r\nsilver and brass _hibachi_, or fire boxes, are there, with their\r\naccompanying tongs and charcoal baskets,--whole kitchens, with\r\neverything required for cooking the finest of Japanese feasts, as finely\r\nmade as if for actual use; all the necessary toilet apparatus,--combs,\r\nmirrors, utensils for blackening the teeth, for shaving the eyebrows,\r\nfor reddening the lips and whitening the face,--all these things are\r\nthere to delight the souls of all the little girls who may have the\r\nopportunity to behold them. For three days the imperial effigies are\r\nserved sumptuously at each meal, and the little girls of the family\r\ntake pleasure in serving their imperial majesties; but when the feast\r\nends, the dolls and their belongings are packed away in their boxes, and\r\nlodged in the fire-proof warehouse for another year.\r\n\r\nThe Tokugawa collection, of which I have spoken, is remarkably full and\r\ncostly, for it has been making for hundreds of years in one of the\r\nyounger branches of a family which for two and a half centuries was\r\npossessed of almost imperial power, and lived in more than imperial\r\nluxury; but there are few households so poor that they do not from year\r\nto year accumulate a little store of toys wherewith to celebrate the\r\nfeast, and, whether the toys are many or few, the feast is the event of\r\nthe year in the lives of the little girls of Japan.[*31]\r\n\r\nBeside the regular feasts at stated seasons, our little girl has a great\r\nvariety of toys and games, some belonging to particular seasons, some\r\nplayed at any time during the year. At the New Year the popular\r\nout-of-door games are battledoor and shuttlecock, and ball. There is no\r\nprettier sight, to my mind, than a group of little girls in their\r\nmany-colored wide-sleeved dresses playing with battledoor or ball. The\r\ngraceful, rhythmic motion of their bodies, the bright upturned eyes, the\r\nlaughing faces, are set off to perfection by the coloring of their\r\nflowing drapery; and their agility on their high, lacquered clogs is a\r\nconstant source of wonder and admiration to any one who has ever made an\r\neffort to walk upon the clumsy things. There are dolls, too, that are\r\nnot relegated to the storehouse when the Feast of Dolls is ended, but\r\nwho are the joy and comfort of their little mothers during the whole\r\nyear; and at every _kwan-ko-ba_, or bazaar, an endless variety of games,\r\npuzzles, pictures to be cut out and glued together, and amusements of\r\nall kinds, may be purchased at extremely low rates. There is no dearth\r\nof games for our little girl, and many pleasant hours are spent in the\r\nhousehold sitting room with games, or conundrums, or stories, or the\r\nsimple girlish chatter that elicits constant laughter from sheer\r\nyouthful merriment.\r\n\r\nAs for fairy tales, so dear to the hearts of children in every country,\r\nthe Japanese child has her full share. Often she listens, half asleep,\r\nwhile cuddling under the warm quilted cover of the _kotatsu_,[6] in the\r\ncold winter evenings, to the drowsy voice of the old grandmother or\r\nnurse, who carries her away on the wings of imagination to the wonderful\r\npalace of the sea gods, or to the haunts of the terrible _oni_, monsters\r\nwith red, distorted faces and fearful horns. Momotaro, the Peach Boy,\r\nwith his wonderful feats in the conquest of the _oni_, is her hero,\r\nuntil he is supplanted by the more real ones of Japanese history.\r\n\r\n[6] _Kotatsu_, a charcoal fire in a brazier or a small fireplace in the\r\nfloor, over which a wooden frame is set and the whole covered by a\r\nquilt. The family sit about it in cold weather with the quilt drawn up\r\nover the feet and knees.\r\n\r\nThere are occasional all-day visits to the theatre, too, where, seated\r\non the floor in a box, railed off from those adjoining, our little girl,\r\nin company with her mother and sisters, enjoys, though with paroxysms of\r\nhorror and fear, the heroic historical plays which are now almost all\r\nthat is left of the heroic old Japan. Here she catches the spirit of\r\npassionate loyalty that belonged to those days, forms her ideals of what\r\na noble Japanese woman should be willing to do for parents or husband,\r\nand comes away taught, as she could be by no other teaching, what the\r\nspirit was that animated her ancestors,--what spirit must animate her,\r\nshould she wish to be a worthy descendant of the women of old.\r\n\r\nAmong these surroundings, with these duties and amusements, our little\r\ngirl grows to womanhood. The unconscious and beautiful spirit of her\r\nchildhood is not driven away at the dawn of womanhood by thoughts of\r\nbeaux, of coming out in society, of a brief career of flirtation and\r\nconquest, and at the end as fine a marriage, either for love or money,\r\nas her imagination can picture. She takes no thought for these things\r\nherself, and her intercourse with young men, though free and\r\nunconstrained, has about it no grain of flirtation or romantic interest.\r\nWhen the time comes for her to marry, her father will have her meet some\r\neligible young man, and both she and the young man will know, when they\r\nare brought together, what is the end in view, and will make up their\r\nminds about the matter. But until that time comes, the modest Japanese\r\nmaiden carries on no flirtations, thinks little of men except as higher\r\nbeings to be deferred to and waited on, and preserves the childlike\r\ninnocence of manner, combined with a serene dignity under all\r\ncircumstances, that is so noticeable a trait in the Japanese woman from\r\nchildhood to old age.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese woman is, under this discipline, a finished product at the\r\nage of sixteen or eighteen. She is pure, sweet, and amiable, with great\r\npower of self-control, and a knowledge of what to do upon all occasions.\r\nThe higher part of her nature is little developed; no great religious\r\ntruths have lifted her soul above the world into a clearer and higher\r\natmosphere; but as far as she goes, in regard to all the little things\r\nof daily life, she is bright, industrious, sweet-tempered, and\r\nattractive, and prepared to do well her duty, when that duty comes to\r\nher, as wife and mother and mistress of a household. The highest\r\nprinciple upon which she is taught to act is obedience, even to the\r\npoint of violating all her finest feminine instincts, at the command of\r\nfather or husband; and acting under that principle, she is capable of an\r\nentire self-abnegation such as few women of any race can achieve.\r\n\r\nWith the close of her childhood, the happiest period in the life of a\r\nJapanese woman closes. The discipline that she has received so far,\r\nrepressive and constant as it has often been, has been from kind and\r\nloving parents. She has freedom, to a certain degree, such as is unknown\r\nto any other country in Asia. In the home she is truly loved, often the\r\npet and plaything of the household, though not receiving the caresses\r\nand words of endearment that children in America expect as a right, for\r\nlove in Japan is undemonstrative.[7] But just at the time when her mind\r\nbroadens, and the desire for knowledge and self-improvement develops,\r\nthe restraints and checks upon her become more severe. Her sphere seems\r\nto grow narrower, difficulties one by one increase, and the young girl,\r\nwho sees life before her as something broad and expansive, who looks to\r\nthe future with expectant joy, may become, in a few years, the weary,\r\ndisheartened woman.\r\n\r\n[7] Kisses are unknown, and regarded by conservative Japanese as an\r\nanimal and disgusting way of expressing affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far we have spoken only of the domestic training of a Japanese girl.\r\nThat part of her education that she gains through teachers and schools\r\nmust be the subject of a separate chapter. Japan differs from most\r\nOriental countries in the fact that her women are considered worthy of a\r\ncertain amount of the culture that comes from the study of books; and\r\nalthough, until recently, schools for girls were unknown in the empire,\r\nnevertheless every woman, except those of the lower classes, received\r\ninstruction in the ordinary written language, while some were well\r\nversed in the Chinese classics and the poetic art. These, with some\r\nmusical accomplishment, an acquaintance with etiquette and the arts of\r\narranging flowers, of making the ceremonial tea, and in many cases not\r\nonly of writing a beautiful hand, but of flower-painting as well, in the\r\nold days made up the whole of an ordinary woman's education. Among the\r\nlower classes, especially the merchant class, instruction was sometimes\r\ngiven in the various pantomimic dances which one sees most frequently\r\npresented by professional dancing girls. The art of dancing is not\r\nusually practiced by women of the higher classes, but among the\r\ndaughters of the merchants special dances were learned for exhibition at\r\nhome, or even at the _matsuri_ or religious festival, and their\r\nperformance was for the amusement of spectators, and not especially for\r\nthe pleasure of the dancers themselves. These dances are modest and\r\ngraceful, but from the fact that they are always learned for\r\nentertaining an audience, however small and select, and are most\r\nfrequently performed by professional dancers of questionable character,\r\nthe more refined and higher class Japanese do not care especially to\r\nhave their daughters learn them.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, little girls were not sent to school, but, going to the\r\nhouse of a private teacher, received the necessary instruction in\r\nreading, and writing. The writing and reading at the beginning, are\r\ntaught simultaneously, the teacher writing a letter upon a sheet of\r\npaper and telling the scholar its name, and the scholar writing it over\r\nand over until, by the time she has acquired the necessary skill in\r\nwriting it, both name and form are indelibly imprinted upon her memory.\r\nTo write, with a brush dipped in India ink, upon soft paper, the hand\r\nentirely without support, is an art that seldom can be acquired by a\r\ngrown person, but when learned in childhood it gives great deftness in\r\nwhatever other art may be subsequently studied. This is perhaps the\r\nreason why the Japanese value a good handwriting more highly than any\r\nother accomplishment, for it denotes a manual dexterity that is the\r\nsecret of success in all the arts, and one who writes the Chinese\r\ncharacters well and rapidly can quickly learn to do anything else with\r\nthe fingers.\r\n\r\nThe fault that one finds with the Japanese system--a fault that lies\r\ndeeper than the mere methods of teaching, and has its root in the\r\nideographic character of the written language--is that, while it\r\ncultivates the memory and powers of observation to a remarkable extent,\r\nand while it gives great skill in the use of the fingers, it affords\r\nlittle opportunity for the development of the reasoning powers.[8] The\r\nyears of study that are required for mastering the written language, so\r\nas to be able to grasp the thoughts already given to the world, leave\r\ncomparatively little time for the conducting of any continuous thought\r\non one's own account, and so we find in Japanese scholars--whether boys\r\nor girls--quickness of apprehension, retentive memories, industry and\r\nmethod in their study of their lessons, but not much originality of\r\nthought. This result comes, I believe, from the nature of the written\r\nlanguage and the difficulties that attend the mastery of it; as a\r\nconsequence of which, an educated man or woman becomes simply a student\r\nof other men's thoughts and sayings about things instead of being a\r\nstudent of the things themselves.\r\n\r\n[8] The Japanese written language is a strange combination of Chinese\r\nand Japanese, to read which a knowledge of the Chinese characters is\r\nnecessary. Chinese literature written in the Chinese ideographs, which\r\nof course give no clue to the sound, are read by Japanese with the\r\nJapanese rendering of the words, and the Japanese order of words in the\r\nsentence. When there have not been exact equivalent Japanese words, a\r\nChinese term has come into use, so that much corrupt Chinese is now well\r\nengrafted into the Japanese language, both written and spoken. In the\r\nforming of new words and technical terms Chinese words are used, as the\r\nGreek and Latin are here. There is probably no similarity in the origin\r\nof the two languages, but the Japanese borrowed from the Chinese about\r\nthe sixth century A. D. their cleverly planned but most complex method\r\nof expressing thought in writing. The introduction of the Chinese\r\nliterature has done much for Japan, and to master this language is one\r\nof the essentials in the education of every boy. At least seven or eight\r\nthousand characters must be learned for daily use, and there are several\r\ndifferent styles of writing each of them. For a scholar, twice as many,\r\nor even more, must be mastered in order to read the various works in\r\nthat rich literature.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese language contains a syllabary of forty-eight letters, and\r\nin books and newspapers for the common people is printed, by the side of\r\nthe Chinese character, the rendering of it, in the letters of the\r\n_kana_, or Japanese alphabet.[*40]\r\n\r\nA Japanese woman is not expected to do much in the study of Chinese. She\r\nwill, of course, learn a few of the most common characters, such as are\r\nused in letter-writing, and for the rest she will read by the help of\r\nthe _kana_.\r\n\r\nMusic in Japan is an accomplishment reserved almost entirely for women,\r\nfor priests, and for blind men. It seems to me quite fortunate that the\r\nmusical art is not more generally practiced, as Japanese music, as a\r\nrule, is far from agreeable to the untrained ear of the outside\r\nbarbarian.[*41] The _koto_ is the pleasantest of the Japanese\r\ninstruments, but probably on account of its large size, which makes it\r\ninconvenient to keep in a small Japanese house, it is used most among\r\nthe higher classes, from the _samurai_[9] upwards. The _koto_ is an\r\nembryo piano, a horizontal sounding-board, some six feet long, upon\r\nwhich are stretched strings supported by ivory bridges. It is played by\r\nmeans of ivory finger-tips fitted to the thumb, forefinger, and middle\r\nfinger of the right hand, and gives forth agreeable sounds, not unlike\r\nthose of the harp. The player sits before the _koto_ on knees and heels,\r\nin the ordinary Japanese attitude, and her motions are very graceful and\r\npretty as she touches the strings, often supplementing the strains of\r\nthe instrument with her voice. The teaching of this instrument and of\r\nthe _samisen_, or Japanese guitar, is almost entirely in the hands of\r\nblind men, who in Japan support themselves by the two professions of\r\nmusic and massage,--all the blind, who cannot learn the former, becoming\r\nadepts in the latter profession.\r\n\r\n[9] The _samurai_ in the feudal times were the hereditary retainers of a\r\n_daimi[=o]_, or feudal lord. They formed the military and literary class.\r\nFor further information, see chap. viii., on _Samurai Women_.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of flowers is taught as a fine art, and much time may\r\nbe spent in learning how, by clipping, bending, and fixing in its place\r\nin the vase, each spray and twig may be made to look as if actually\r\ngrowing, for flower arranging is not merely to show the flower itself,\r\nbut includes the proper arrangement of the branches, twigs, and leaves\r\nof plants. The flower plays only a small part, and is not used in\r\ndecoration, except on the branch and stem as it is in nature, and the\r\nart consists in the preservation of the natural bend and growth when\r\nfixed in the vase. In every case, each branch has certain curves, which\r\nmust be in harmony with the whole. Branches of pine, bamboo, and the\r\nflowering plum are much used.\r\n\r\nTeachers spend much time in showing proper and improper combinations of\r\ndifferent flowers, as well as the arrangement of them. Many different\r\nstyles have come up, originated by the famous teachers who have founded\r\nvarious schools of the art,--an art which is unique and exceedingly\r\npopular, requiring artistic talent and a cultivated eye. One often sees,\r\non going into the guest room of a Japanese house, a vase containing\r\ngracefully arranged flowers set in the _tokonoma_, or raised alcove of\r\nthe room, under the solitary _kakémono_[10] that forms the chief\r\nornament of the apartment. As these two things, the vase of flowers and\r\nthe hanging scroll, are the only adornments, it is more necessary that\r\nthe flowers should be carefully arranged, than in our crowded rooms,\r\nwhere a vase of flowers may easily escape the eye, perplexed by the\r\nmultitude of objects which surround it.\r\n\r\n[10] _Kakémono_, a hanging scroll, upon which a picture is painted, or\r\nsome poem or sentiment written.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial tea must not be confounded with the ordinary serving of\r\ntea for refreshment. The proper making, and serving, and drinking of the\r\nceremonial tea is the most formal of social observances, each step in\r\nwhich is prescribed by a rigid code of etiquette. The tea, instead of\r\nbeing the whole leaf, such as is used for ordinary occasions, is a fine,\r\ngreen powder. The infusion is made, not in a small pot, from which it is\r\npoured out into cups, but in a bowl, into which the hot water is poured\r\nfrom a dipper on to the powdered tea. The mixture is stirred with a\r\nbamboo whisk until it foams, then handed with much ceremony to the\r\nguest, who takes it with equal ceremony and drinks it from the bowl,\r\nemptying the receptacle at three gulps. Should there be a number of\r\nguests, tea is made for each in turn, in the order of their rank, in the\r\nsame bowl. For this ceremonial tea, a special set of utensils is used,\r\nall of antique and severely simple style. The charcoal used for heating\r\nthe water is of a peculiar variety; and the room in which the tea is\r\nmade and served is built for that special purpose, and kept sacred for\r\nthat use. This art, which is often part of the education of women of the\r\nhigher classes, is taught by regular teachers, often by gentlewomen who\r\nhave fallen into distressed circumstances.[*45] I remember with great\r\nvividness a visit paid to an old lady living near a provincial city of\r\nJapan, who had for years supported herself by giving lessons in this\r\npolitest of arts. Her little house, of the daintiest and neatest type,\r\nseemed filled to overflowing by three foreigners, whom she received with\r\nthe courtliest of welcomes. At the request of my friend, an American\r\nlady engaged in missionary work in that part of the country, she gave us\r\na lesson in the etiquette of the tea ceremony. Every motion, from the\r\nbringing in and arranging of the utensils to the final rinsing and\r\nwiping of the tea bowl, was according to rules strictly laid down, and\r\nthe whole ceremony had more the solemnity of a religious ritual than the\r\nlightness and gayety of a social occasion.\r\n\r\nEtiquette of all kinds is not left in Japan to chance, to be learned by\r\nobservation and imitation of any model that may present itself, but is\r\ntaught regularly by teachers who make a specialty of it. Everything in\r\nthe daily life has its rules, and the etiquette teacher has them all at\r\nher fingers' ends. There have been several famous teachers of etiquette,\r\nand they have formed systems which differ in minor points, while\r\nagreeing in the principal rules. The etiquette of bowing, the position\r\nof the body, the arms, and the head while saluting, the methods of\r\nshutting and opening the door, rising and sitting down on the floor, the\r\nmanner of serving a meal, or tea, are all, with the minutest details,\r\ntaught to the young girls, who, I imagine, find it rather irksome. I\r\nknow two young girls of new Japan who find nothing so wearisome as\r\ntheir etiquette lesson, and would gladly be excused from it. I have\r\nheard them, after their teacher had left, slyly make fun of her stiff\r\nand formal manners. Such people as she will, I fear, soon belong only to\r\nthe past, though it still remains to be seen how much of European\r\nmanners will be engrafted on the old formalities of Japanese life. It\r\nis, perhaps, because of this regular teaching in the ways of polite\r\nsociety, that the Japanese girl seems never at a loss, even under\r\nunusual circumstances, but bears herself with self-possession in places\r\nwhere young girls in America would be embarrassed and awkward.\r\n\r\nBut the Japanese are rapidly finding out that this busy nineteenth\r\ncentury gives little time for learning how to shut and open doors in the\r\npolitest manner, and indeed such things under the newly established\r\nschool system are now relegated entirely to the girls' schools, the boys\r\nhaving no lessons in etiquette.\r\n\r\nThe method of teaching flower-painting is so interesting that I must\r\nspeak of it before I leave the subject of accomplishments. I have said\r\nthat the acquisition of skill in writing the Chinese characters was the\r\nbest possible preparation for skill in all other arts. This is\r\nespecially true of the art of painting, which is simply the next step,\r\nafter writing has been learned. The painting master, when he comes to\r\nthe house, brings no design as a model, but sits down on the floor\r\nbefore the little desk, and on a sheet of paper paints with great\r\nrapidity the design that he wishes the pupil to copy. It may be simply\r\ntwo or three blades of grass upon which the pupil makes a beginning, but\r\nshe is expected to make her picture with exactly the same number of bold\r\nstrokes that the master puts into his. Again and again she blunders her\r\nstrokes on to a sheet of paper, until at last, when sheet after sheet\r\nhas been spoiled, she begins to see some semblance of the master's copy\r\nin her own daub. She perseveres, making copy after copy, until she is\r\nable from memory to put upon the paper at a moment's notice the three\r\nblades of grass to her master's satisfaction. Only then can she go on to\r\na new copy, and only after many such designs have been committed to\r\nmemory, and the free, dashing stroke necessary for Japanese painting has\r\nbeen acquired, is she allowed to undertake any copying from nature, or\r\noriginal designing.[*49]\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus far only upon the entirely Japanese education that was\r\npermitted to women under the old régime. That it was an effective and\r\nrefining system, all can testify who have made the acquaintance of any\r\nof the charming Japanese ladies whose schooling was finished before\r\nCommodore Perry disturbed the repose of old Japan. As I write, the image\r\ncomes before me of a sweet-faced, bright-eyed little gentlewoman with\r\nwhom it was my good fortune to become intimately acquainted during my\r\nstay in T[=o]ky[=o]. A widow, left penniless, with one child to support,\r\nshe earned the merest pittance by teaching sewing at one of the\r\ngovernment schools in T[=o]ky[=o]; but in all the circumstances of her\r\nlife, narrow and busy as it needs must be, she proved herself a lady\r\nthrough and through. Polite, cheerful, an intelligent and cultivated\r\nreader, a thrifty housekeeper, a loving and careful mother, a true and\r\nhelpful friend, her memory is associated with many of my pleasantest\r\nhours in Japan, and she is but one of the many who bear witness to the\r\nculture that might be acquired by women in the old days.\r\n\r\nBut the Japan of old is not the Japan of to-day, and in the school\r\nsystem now prevalent throughout the empire girls and boys are equally\r\nprovided for. First the schools established by the various missionary\r\nsocieties, and then the government schools, offered to girls a broader\r\neducation than the old instruction in Chinese, in etiquette, and in\r\naccomplishments. Now, every morning, the streets of the cities and\r\nvillages are alive with boys and girls clattering along, with their\r\nbooks and lunch boxes in their hands, to the kindergarten, primary,\r\ngrammar, high, or normal school. Every rank in life, every grade in\r\nlearning, may find its proper place in the new school system, and the\r\ngirls eagerly grasp their opportunities, and show themselves apt and\r\nwilling students of the new learning offered to them.\r\n\r\nBy the new system, at its present stage of development, too much is\r\nexpected of the Japanese boy or girl. The work required would be a\r\nburden to the quickest mind. The whole of the old education in Japanese\r\nand Chinese literature and composition--an education requiring the best\r\nyears of a boy's life--is given, and grafted upon this, our\r\ncommon-school and high-school studies of mathematics, geography,\r\nhistory, and natural science. In addition to these, at all higher\r\nschools, one foreign language is required, and often two, English\r\nranking first in the popular estimation. Many a headache do the poor,\r\nhard-working students have over the puzzling English language, in which\r\nthey have to begin at the wrong end of the book and read across the page\r\nfrom left to right, instead of from top to bottom, and from right to\r\nleft, as is natural to them. But in spite of its hard work, the new\r\nschool life is cheerful and healthful, and the children enjoy it. It\r\nhelps them to be really children, and, while they are young, to be merry\r\nand playful, not dignified and formal little ladies at all times. Upon\r\nthe young girls, the influence of the schools is to make them more\r\nindependent, self-reliant, and stronger women. In the houses of the\r\nhigher classes, even now, much of the old-time system of repression is\r\nstill in force. Children are indeed \"seen but not heard,\" and from the\r\ntime when they learn to walk they must learn to be polite and\r\ndignified. At school, the more progressive feeling of the times\r\npredominates among the authorities, and the children are encouraged to\r\nunbend and enjoy themselves in games and frolics, as true children\r\nshould do. Much is done for the pleasure of the little ones, who often\r\nenjoy school better than home, and declare that they do not like\r\nholidays.[*52]\r\n\r\nBut the young girl, who has finished this pleasant school life, with all\r\nits advantages, is not as well fitted as under the old system for the\r\nduties and trials of married life, unless under exceptional\r\ncircumstances, where the husband chosen has advanced ideas. To those\r\nteaching the young girls of Japan to-day, the problem of how to educate\r\nthem aright is a deep one, and with each newly trained girl sent out go\r\nmany hopes, mingled with anxieties, in regard to the training she has\r\nhad as a preparation for the new life she is about to enter. The few,\r\nthe pioneers, will have to suffer for the happiness and good of the\r\nmany, for the problem of grafting the new on to the old is indeed a\r\ndifficult one, to be solved only after many experiments.\r\n\r\nThere are many difficulties which lie in the way of the new schools\r\nthat must be met, studied, and overcome. One of them is the one already\r\nreferred to, the problem of how best to combine the new and the old in\r\nthe school curriculum. That the old learning and literature, the old\r\npoliteness and sweetness of manner, must not be given up or made little\r\nof, is evident to every right-minded student of the matter. That the\r\nnewer and broader culture, with its higher morality, its greater\r\ndevelopment of the best powers of the mind, must play a large part in\r\nthe Japan of the future, there is not a shadow of doubt, and the women\r\nmust not be left behind in the onward movement of the nation. But how to\r\ngive to the young minds the best products of the thought of two such\r\ndistinct civilizations is a question that is as yet unanswered, and\r\ncannot be satisfactorily settled until the effect of the new education\r\nhas begun to show itself in a generation or so of graduates from the new\r\nschools. Another difficulty is in the matter of health. Most of the new\r\nschool-houses are fitted with seats and desks, such as are found in\r\nAmerican schools. Many of them are heated by stoves or furnaces. The\r\nscholars in most cases wear the Japanese dress, which in winter is made\r\nwarm enough to be worn in rooms having no artificial heat. Put this warm\r\ncostume into an artificially heated room and the result is an\r\nover-heating of the body, and a subsequent chill when the pupil goes,\r\nwith no extra covering, into the keen out-of-door air. From this cause\r\nalone, arise many colds and lung troubles, which can be prevented when\r\nmore experience has shown how the costumes of the East and West can be\r\ncombined to suit the new conditions. Another part of the health problem\r\nlies in the fact that in many cases the parents do not understand the\r\nproper care of a growing girl, ambitious to excel in her studies.\r\nInstead of the regular hours, healthful food, and gentle restraint that\r\na girl needs under those circumstances, our little Japanese maiden is\r\nallowed to sit up to any hour of the night, or arise at any hour in the\r\nmorning, to prepare her lessons, is given food of most indigestible\r\nquality at all hours of the day between her regular meals, and is\r\nfrequently urged to greater mental exertion than her delicate body can\r\nendure.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty, in fitting the new school system into the customs\r\nof the people, lies in the early age at which marriages are contracted.\r\nBefore the girl has finished her school course, her parents begin to\r\nwonder whether there is not danger of her being left on their hands\r\naltogether, if they do not hand her over to the first eligible young man\r\nwho presents himself. Sometimes the girl makes a brave fight, and\r\nremains in school until her course is finished; more often she succumbs\r\nand is married off, bids a weeping farewell to her teachers and\r\nschoolmates, and leaves the school, to become a wife at sixteen, a\r\nmother at eighteen, and an old woman at thirty. In some cases, the\r\nbreaking down of a girl's health may be traced to threats on the part of\r\nher parents that, if she does not take a certain rank in her studies,\r\nshe will be taken from school and married off.[*55]\r\n\r\nThese are difficulties that may be overcome when a generation has been\r\neducated who can, as parents, avoid the mistakes that now endanger the\r\nhealth of a Japanese school-girl. In the mean time, boarding schools,\r\nthat can attend to matters of health and hygiene among the girls,\r\nwould, if they could be conducted with the proper admixture of Eastern\r\nand Western learning and manners, do a great deal toward educating that\r\ngeneration. The missionary schools do much in this direction, but the\r\ncriticism of the Japanese upon the manners of the girls educated in\r\nmissionary schools is universally severe. To a foreigner who has lived\r\nalmost entirely among Japanese ladies of pure Japanese education, the\r\nmanners of the girls in these schools seem brusque and awkward; and\r\nthough they are many of them noble women and doing noble work, there is\r\nroom for hope that in the future of Japan the charm of manner which is\r\nthe distinguishing feature of the Japanese woman will not be lost by\r\ncontact with our Western shortness and roughness. A happy mean\r\nundoubtedly can be reached; and when it is, the women of new Japan will\r\nbe able to bear a not unfavorable comparison with the women of the old\r\nrégime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Japanese maiden arrives at the age of sixteen, or thereabouts,\r\nshe is expected as a matter of course to marry. She is usually allowed\r\nher choice in regard to whether she will or will not marry a certain\r\nman, but she is expected to marry some one, and not to take too much\r\ntime in making up her mind. The alternative of perpetual spinsterhood is\r\nnever considered, either by herself or her parents. Marriage is as much\r\na matter of course in a woman's life as death, and is no more to be\r\navoided. This being the case, our young woman has only as much liberty\r\nof choice accorded to her as is likely to provide against a great amount\r\nof unhappiness in her married life. If she positively objects to the man\r\nwho is proposed to her, she is seldom forced to marry him, but no more\r\ncordial feeling than simple toleration is expected of her before\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThe courtship is somewhat after the following manner. A young man, who\r\nfinds himself in a position to marry, speaks to some married friend, and\r\nasks him to be on the lookout for a beautiful[11] and accomplished\r\nmaiden, who would be willing to become his wife. The friend, acting\r\nrather as advance agent, makes a canvass of all the young maidens of his\r\nacquaintance, inquiring among his friends; and finally decides that\r\nso-and-so (Miss Flower, let us say) will be a very good match for his\r\nfriend. Having arrived at this decision, he goes to Miss Flower's\r\nparents and lays the case of his friend before them. Should they approve\r\nof the suitor, a party is arranged at the house of some common friend,\r\nwhere the young people may have a chance to meet each other and decide\r\neach upon the other's merits. Should the young folks find no fault with\r\nthe match, presents are exchanged,[12] a formal betrothal is entered\r\ninto, and the marriage is hastened forward. All arrangements between the\r\ncontracting parties are made by go-betweens, or seconds, who hold\r\nthemselves responsible for the success of the marriage, and must be\r\nconcerned in the divorce proceedings, should divorce become desirable or\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n[11] The Japanese standard of female beauty differs in many respects\r\nfrom our own, so that it is almost impossible for a foreigner visiting\r\nJapan to comprehend the judgments of the Japanese in regard to the\r\nbeauty of their own women, and even more impossible for the untraveled\r\nJapanese to discover the reasons for a foreigner's judgments upon either\r\nJapanese or foreign beauties. To the Japanese, the ideal female face\r\nmust be long and narrow; the forehead high and narrow in the middle, but\r\nwidening and lowering at the sides, conforming to the outline of the\r\nbeloved Fuji, the mountain that Japanese art loves to picture. The hair\r\nshould be straight and glossy black, and absolutely smooth. Japanese\r\nladies who have the misfortune to have any wave or ripple in their hair,\r\nas many of them do, are at as much pains to straighten it in the\r\ndressing as American ladies are to simulate a natural curl, when Nature\r\nhas denied them that charm. The eyes should be long and narrow, slanting\r\nupward at the outer corners; and the eyebrows should be delicate lines,\r\nhigh above the eye itself. The distinctly aquiline nose should be low at\r\nthe bridge, the curve outward beginning much lower down than upon the\r\nCaucasian face; and the eye-socket should not be outlined at all, either\r\nby the brow, the cheek, or by the nose. It is this flatness of the face\r\nabout the eyes that gives the mildness of expression to all young people\r\nof Mongolian type that is so noticeable a trait always in their\r\nphysiognomy. The mouth of an aristocratic Japanese lady must be small,\r\nand the lips full and red; the neck, a conspicuous feature always when\r\nthe Japanese dress is worn, should be long and slender, and gracefully\r\ncurved. The complexion should be light,--a clear ivory-white, with\r\nlittle color in the cheeks. The blooming country girl style of beauty is\r\nnot admired, and everything, even to color in the cheeks, must be\r\nsacrificed to gain the delicacy that is the _sine qua non_ of the\r\nJapanese beauty. The figure should be slender, the waist long, but not\r\nespecially small, and the hips narrow, to secure the best effect with\r\nthe Japanese dress. The head and shoulders should be carried slightly\r\nforward, and the body should also be bent forward slightly at the waist,\r\nto secure the most womanly and aristocratic carriage. In walking, the\r\nstep should be short and quick, with the toes turned in, and the foot\r\nlifted so slightly that either clog or sandal will scuff with every\r\nstep. This is necessary for modesty, with the narrow skirt of the\r\nJapanese dress.\r\n\r\nContrast with this type the fair, curling hair, the round blue eyes, the\r\nrosy cheeks, the erect, slim-waisted, large-hipped figures of many\r\nforeign beauties,--the rapid, long, clean-stepping walk, and the air of\r\nalmost masculine strength and independence, which belongs especially to\r\nEnglish and American women,--and one can see how the Japanese find\r\nlittle that they recognize as beauty among them. Blue eyes, set into\r\ndeep sockets, and with the bridge of the nose rising as a barrier\r\nbetween them, impart a fierce grotesqueness to the face, that the\r\nuntraveled Japanese seldom admire. The very babies will scream with\r\nhorror at first sight of a blue-eyed, light-haired foreigner, and it is\r\nonly after considerable familiarity with such persons that they can be\r\ninduced to show anything but the wildest fright in their presence.\r\nForeigners who have lived a great deal among the Japanese find their\r\nstandards unconsciously changing, and see, to their own surprise, that\r\ntheir countrywomen look ungainly, fierce, aggressive, and awkward among\r\nthe small, mild, shrinking, and graceful Japanese ladies.\r\n\r\n[12] The present from the groom is usually a piece of handsome silk,\r\nused for the _obi_ or girdle. This takes the place of the conventional\r\nengagement ring of Europe and America.[*60] From the family of the\r\nbride, silk, such as is made up into men's dresses, is sent.\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony, which seems to be neither religious nor legal in\r\nits nature,[*61a] takes place at the house of the groom, to which the\r\nbride is carried, accompanied by her go-betweens, and, if she be of the\r\nhigher classes, by her own confidential maid, who will serve her as her\r\npersonal attendant in the new life in her husband's house. The trousseau\r\nand household goods, which the bride is expected to bring with her, are\r\nsent before.[*61b] The household goods required by custom as a part of\r\nthe outfit of every bride are as follows: A bureau; a low desk or table\r\nfor writing; a work-box; two of the lacquer trays or tables on which\r\nmeals are served, together with everything required for furnishing them,\r\neven to the chopsticks; and two or more complete sets of handsome bed\r\nfurnishings. The trousseau will contain, if the bride be of a well-to-do\r\nfamily, dresses for all seasons, and handsome sashes without number; for\r\nthe unchanging fashions of Japan, together with the durable quality of\r\nthe dress material, make it possible for a woman, at the time of her\r\nmarriage, to enter her husband's house with a supply of clothing that\r\nmay last her through her lifetime. The parents of the bride, in giving\r\nup their daughter, as they do when she marries, show the estimation in\r\nwhich they have held her by the beauty and completeness of the trousseau\r\nwith which they provide her. This is her very own; and in the event of a\r\ndivorce, she brings back with her to her father's house the clothing and\r\nhousehold goods that she carried away as a bride.\r\n\r\nWith the bride and her trousseau are sent a great number of presents\r\nfrom the family of the bride to the members of the groom's household.\r\nEach member of the family, from the aged grandfather to the youngest\r\ngrandchild, receives some remembrance of the occasion; and even the\r\nservants and retainers, down to the _jinrikisha_ men, and the _bett[=o]_\r\nin the stables, are not forgotten by the bride's relatives. Beside this\r\npresent-giving, the friends and relatives of the bride and groom, as in\r\nthis country, send gifts to the young couple, often some article for use\r\nin the household, or crêpe or silk for dresses.\r\n\r\nIn old times, the wedding took place in the afternoon, but it is now\r\nusually celebrated in the evening. The ceremony consists merely in a\r\nformal drinking of the native wine (_saké_) from a two-spouted cup,\r\nwhich is presented to the mouths of the bride and groom alternately.\r\nThis drinking from one cup is a symbol of the equal sharing of the joys\r\nand sorrows of married life. At the ceremony no one is present but the\r\nbride and bridegroom, their go-betweens, and a young girl, whose duty it\r\nis to present the cup to the lips of the contracting parties. When this\r\nis over, the wedding guests, who have been assembled in the next room\r\nduring the ceremony, join the wedding party, a grand feast is spread,\r\nand much merriment ensues.[13]\r\n\r\n[13] Many women still blacken their teeth after marriage, after the\r\nmanner universal in the past; but this custom is, fortunately, rapidly\r\ngoing out of fashion.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the wedding, the newly married couple are\r\nexpected to make a visit to the bride's family, and for this great\r\npreparations are made. A large party is usually given by the bride's\r\nparents, either in the afternoon or evening, in honor of this occasion,\r\nto which the friends of the bride's family are invited. The young\r\ncouple bring with them presents from the groom's family to the bride's,\r\nin return for the presents sent on the wedding day.[*64]\r\n\r\nThe festivities often begin early in the afternoon and keep up until\r\nlate at night. A fine dinner is served, and music and dancing, by\r\nprofessional performers, or some other entertainment, serve to make the\r\ntime pass pleasantly. The bride appears as hostess with her mother,\r\nentertaining the company, and receiving their congratulations, and must\r\nremain to speed the last departing guest, before leaving the paternal\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nWithin the course of two or three months, the newly married couple are\r\nexpected to give an entertainment, or series of entertainments, to their\r\nfriends, as an announcement of the marriage. As the wedding ceremony is\r\nprivate, and no notice is given, nor are cards sent out, this is\r\nsometimes the first intimation that is received of the marriage by many\r\nof the acquaintances, though the news of a wedding usually travels\r\nquickly. The entertainment may be a dinner party, given at home, or at\r\nsome tea-house, similar in many ways to the one given at the bride's\r\nhome by her parents. Sometimes it is a garden party, and very lately it\r\nhas become the fashion for officials and people of high rank to give a\r\nball in foreign style.\r\n\r\nBesides the entertainment, presents of red rice, or _mochi_, are sent as\r\na token of thanks to all who have remembered the young couple. These are\r\narranged even more elaborately than the ones sent after the birth of an\r\nheir.\r\n\r\nThe young people are not, as in this country, expected to set up\r\nhousekeeping by themselves, and establish a new home. Marriages often\r\ntake place early in life, even before the husband has any means of\r\nsupporting a family; and as a matter of course, a son with his wife\r\nmakes his abode with his parents, and forms simply a new branch of the\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nThe only act required to make the marriage legal is the withdrawal of\r\nthe bride's name from the list of her father's family as registered by\r\nthe government, and its entry upon the register of her husband's family.\r\nFrom that time forward she severs all ties with her father's house, save\r\nthose of affection, and is more closely related by law and custom to\r\nher husband's relatives than to her own. Even this legal recognition of\r\nher marriage is a comparatively new thing in Japan, as is any limitation\r\nof the right of divorce on the part of the husband, or extension of that\r\nright to the wife.[14]\r\n\r\n[14] \"As early as 1870 an edict was published by which official notice\r\nand approbation were made necessary preliminaries to every matrimonial\r\ncontract. In the following year the class-limitations upon freedom of\r\nmarriage were abolished, and two years later the right of suing for a\r\ndivorce was conceded to the wife.\"--Rein's _Japan_, p. 425.\r\n\r\nAt present in Japan the marriage relation is by no means a permanent\r\none, as it is virtually dissoluble at the will of either party, and the\r\ncondition of public opinion is such among the lower classes that it is\r\nnot an unknown occurrence for a man to marry and divorce several wives\r\nin succession; and for a woman, who has been divorced once or twice, to\r\nbe willing and able to marry well a second or even a third time. Among\r\nthe higher classes, the dread of the scandal and gossip, that must\r\nattach themselves to troubles between man and wife, serves as a\r\nrestraint upon too free use of the power of divorce; but still,\r\ndivorces among the higher classes are so common now that one meets\r\nnumerous respectable and respected persons who have at some time in\r\ntheir lives gone through such an experience.\r\n\r\nOne provision of the law, which serves to make most mothers endure any\r\nevil of married life rather than sue for a divorce, is the fact that the\r\nchildren belong to the father; and no matter how unfit a person he may\r\nbe to have the care of them, the disposal of them in case of a divorce\r\nrests absolutely with him. A divorced woman returns childless to her\r\nfather's house; and many women, in consequence of this law or custom,\r\nwill do their best to keep the family together, working the more\r\nstrenuously in this direction, the more brutal and worthless the husband\r\nproves himself to be.\r\n\r\nThe ancestor worship, as found in Japan, the tracing of relationship in\r\nthe male line only, and the generally accepted belief that children\r\ninherit their qualities from their father rather than from the mother,\r\nmake them his children and not hers. Thus we often see children of noble\r\nrank on the father's side, but ignoble on the mother's, inherit the\r\nrank of their father, and not permitted even to recognize their mother\r\nas in any way their equal. If she is plebeian, the children are not\r\nregarded as tainted by it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of divorce, even if the law allowed the mother to keep her\r\nchildren, it would be almost an impossibility for her to do so. She has\r\nno means of earning her bread and theirs, for few occupations are open\r\nto women, and she is forced to become a dependent on her father, or some\r\nmale relative. Whatever they may be willing to do for her, it is quite\r\nlikely that they would begrudge aid to the children of another family,\r\nwith whom custom hardly recognizes any tie. The children are the\r\nchildren of the man whose name they bear. If the woman is a favorite\r\ndaughter, it may happen that her father will take her and her children\r\nunder his roof, and support them all; but this is a rare exception, and\r\nonly possible when the husband first gives up all claim to the children.\r\n\r\nThere comes to my mind now a case illustrating this point, which I think\r\nI may cite without betraying confidence. It is that of a most attractive\r\nyoung woman who was married to a worthless husband, but lived\r\nfaithfully with him for several years, and became the mother of three\r\nchildren. The husband, who seemed at first merely good-for-nothing,\r\nbecame worse as the years went by, drank himself out of situation after\r\nsituation procured for him by powerful relatives, and at last became so\r\nviolent that he even beat his wife and threatened his children, a\r\nproceeding most unusual on the part of a Japanese husband and father.\r\nThe poor wife was at last obliged to flee from her husband's house to\r\nher mother's, taking her children with her. She sued for a divorce and\r\nobtained it, and is now married again; her youth, good looks, and high\r\nconnections procuring her a very good catch for her second venture in\r\nmatrimony; but her children are lost to her, and belong wholly to their\r\nworthless, drunken father.\r\n\r\nOf the lack of permanence in the marriage relation among the lower\r\nclasses, the domestic changes of one of my servants in T[=o]ky[=o]\r\nafford an amusing illustration. The man, whom I had hired in the double\r\ncapacity of _jinrikisha_ man and _bett[=o]_ or groom, was a strong,\r\nfaithful, pleasant-faced fellow, recently come to T[=o]ky[=o] from the\r\ncountry. I inquired, when I engaged him, whether he had a wife, as I\r\nwanted some one who could remain in his room in the stable in care of\r\nthe horse when he was pulling me about in the _jinrikisha_. He replied\r\nthat he had a wife, but she was now at Utsunomiya, the country town from\r\nwhich he had come, but he would send for her at once, and she would be\r\nin T[=o]ky[=o] in the course of a week or two. Two or three weeks passed\r\nand no wife appeared, so I inquired of my cook and head servant what had\r\nbecome of Yasaku's wife. He replied, with a twinkle in his eye, that she\r\nhad found work in Utsunomiya and did not wish to come. A week more\r\npassed, and still no wife, and further inquiries elicited from the cook\r\nthe information that Yasaku had divorced her for disobedience, and was\r\non the lookout for a new and more docile helpmate. His first thought was\r\nof the maidservant of the Japanese family who lived in the same house\r\nwith me, a broad-faced, red-cheeked country girl, of a very low grade of\r\nintelligence. He gave this up, however, because he thought it would not\r\nbe polite to put my friends to inconvenience by taking away their\r\nservant. His next effort was by negotiation through a T[=o]ky[=o]\r\nfriend; but apparently Yasaku's country manners were not to the taste of\r\nthe T[=o]ky[=o] damsels, for he met with no success, and was at last\r\ndriven to write to his father in Utsunomiya asking him to select him a\r\nwife and bring her down to T[=o]ky[=o].\r\n\r\nThe selection took a week or two, and at last my maid told me that\r\nYasaku's wife was coming by the next morning's train. A look into the\r\n_bett[=o]'s_ quarters in the stable showed great preparations for the\r\nbride. The mats, new-covered with nice straw matting, were white and\r\nclean; the _shoji_ were mended with new paper; the walls covered with\r\nbright-colored pictures; and various new domestic conveniences had\r\nnearly bankrupted Yasaku, in spite of his large salary of ten dollars a\r\nmonth. He had ordered a fine feast at a neighboring tea house, had had\r\ncards printed with his own name in English and Japanese, and had\r\naltogether been to such great expense that he had had to put his winter\r\nclothes in pawn to secure the necessary money.\r\n\r\nThe day chosen for the marriage was rainy, and, though Yasaku spent all\r\nhis time in going to trains, no bridal party appeared; and he came home\r\nat night disconsolate, to smoke his good-night pipe over his solitary\r\n_hibachi_. He was, no doubt, angry as well as disconsolate, for he sat\r\ndown and penned a severe letter to his father, in which he said that, if\r\nthe bride did not appear on the next day counted lucky for a wedding (no\r\nJapanese would be married on an unlucky day), they could send her back\r\nto her father's house, for he would none of her. This letter did its\r\nwork, for on the next lucky day, about ten days later, the bride\r\nappeared, and Yasaku was given two days of holiday on the agreement that\r\nhe should not be married again while he remained in my service. On the\r\nevening of the second day, the bride came in to pay me her respects,\r\nand, crouching on her hands and knees before me, literally trembled\r\nunder the excitement of her first introduction to a foreigner. She was a\r\ngirl of rather unattractive exterior, fat and heavy, and rather older\r\nthan Yasaku had bargained for, I imagine; at any rate, from the first,\r\nhe seemed dissatisfied with his \"pig in a poke,\" and after a couple of\r\nmonths sent her home to her parents, and was all ready to start out\r\nagain in the hope of better luck next time.\r\n\r\nHere is another instance, from the woman's side. Upon one occasion, when\r\nI was visiting a Japanese lady of high rank who kept a retinue of\r\nservants, the woman who came in with the tea bowed and smiled upon me as\r\nif greeting me after a long absence. As I was in and out of the house\r\nnearly every day, I was a little surprised at this demonstration, which\r\nwas quite different from the formal bow that is given by the servant to\r\nher mistress's guest upon ordinary occasions. When she went out my\r\nfriend said, \"You see O Kiku has come back.\" As I did not know that the\r\nwoman had been away, the news of her return did not affect me greatly\r\nuntil I learned the history of her departure. It seemed that about a\r\nmonth before, she had left her mistress's house to be married; and the\r\nday before my visit she had quietly presented herself, and announced\r\nthat she had come back, if they would take her in. My friend had asked\r\nher what had happened,--whether she had found her husband unkind. No,\r\nher husband was very nice, very kind and good, but his mother was simply\r\nunbearable; she made her work so hard that she actually had no time to\r\nrest at all. She had known before her marriage that her proposed\r\nmother-in-law was a hard task-mistress, but her husband had promised\r\nthat his mother should live with his older brother, and they should have\r\ntheir housekeeping quite independent and separate. As the mother was\r\nthen living with her older son, it seemed unlikely that she would care\r\nto move, and O Kiku San had married on that supposition. But it seemed\r\nthat the wife of the older brother was both lazy and bad-tempered, and\r\nthe new wife of the younger brother soon proved herself industrious and\r\ngood-natured. As the mother's main thought was to go where she would get\r\nthe most comfort and waiting upon, she moved from the elder son's house\r\nto that of her younger son, and began leading her new daughter-in-law\r\nsuch a life that she soon gave up the effort to live with her husband,\r\nsued for a divorce, obtained it, and was back in her old place, all in a\r\nmonth's time from the date of her marriage.\r\n\r\nBut our readers must not suppose, from the various incidents given,\r\nthat few happy marriages take place in Japan, or that, in every rank of\r\nlife, divorce is of every-day occurrence. On the contrary, there seems\r\ncause for wonder, not that there are so many divorces, but that there\r\nare so many happy marriages, with wives and husbands devoted and\r\nfaithful. For a nobleman in the olden times to divorce his wife would\r\nhave caused such a scandal and talk that it rarely occurred. If the wife\r\nwere disliked, he need have little or nothing to do with her, their\r\nrooms, their meals, and their attendance being entirely separate, but he\r\nrarely took away from her the name of wife, empty as it might be. She\r\nusually would be from some other noble house, and great trouble would\r\narise between the families if he attempted to divorce her. The _samurai_\r\nalso, with the same loyalty which they displayed for their lords, were\r\nloyal to their wives, and many a novel has been written, or play acted,\r\nshowing the devotion of husband and wife. The quiet, undemonstrative\r\nlove, though very different from the ravings of a lover in the\r\nnineteenth century novel, is perhaps truer to life.\r\n\r\nAmong the merchants and lower classes there has been, and is, a much\r\nlower standard of morality, but the few years which have passed since\r\nthe Revolution of 1868 are not a fair sample of what Japan has been.\r\nNoblemen, _samurai_, and merchants have had much to undergo in the great\r\nchanges, and, as is the case in all such transition periods, old customs\r\nand restraints, and old standards of morality, have been broken down and\r\nhave not been replaced. There is no doubt that men have run to excesses\r\nof all sorts, and divorces have been much more frequent of late\r\nyears.[*76]\r\n\r\nOur little Japanese maiden knows, when she blackens her teeth, dons her\r\nwedding dress, and starts on her bridal journey to her husband's house,\r\nthat upon her good behavior alone depend her chances of a happy life.\r\nShe is to be henceforth the property of a man of whom she probably knows\r\nlittle, and who has the power, at any whim, to send her back to her\r\nfather's house in disgrace, deprived of her children, with nothing to\r\nlive for or hope for, except that some man will overlook the disgrace of\r\nher divorce, and by marrying her give her the only opportunity that a\r\nJapanese woman can have of a home other than that of a servant or\r\ndependent. That these evils will be remedied in time, there seems little\r\nreason to doubt, but just now the various cooks who are engaged in\r\nbrewing the broth of the new civilization are disagreed in regard to the\r\ncondiments required for its proper flavoring. The conservatives wish to\r\nflavor strongly with the subjection and dependence of women, believing\r\nthat only by that means can feminine virtue be preserved. The younger\r\nmen, of foreign education, would drop into the boiling pot the flavor of\r\nculture and broader outlook; for by this means they hope to secure\r\nhappier homes for all, and better mothers for their children. The\r\nmissionaries and native Christians believe that, when the whole mixture\r\nis well impregnated with practical Christianity, the desired result will\r\nbe achieved. All are agreed on this point, that a strong public opinion\r\nis necessary before improved legislation can produce much effect; and\r\nso, for the present, legislation remains in the background, until the\r\ntime shall come when it can be used in the right way.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the two remedies suggested by the reformers, and see\r\nwhat effect has been produced by each so far, and what may be expected\r\nof them in the future. Taking education first, what are the effects\r\nproduced so far by educating women to a point above the old Japanese\r\nstandard? In many happy homes to-day, we find husbands educated abroad,\r\nand knowing something of the home life of foreign lands, who have sought\r\nout wives of broad intellectual culture, and who make them friends and\r\nconfidants, not simply housekeepers and head-servants. In such homes the\r\nwife has freedom, not such as is enjoyed by American women, perhaps, but\r\nequal to that of most European women. In such homes love and equality\r\nrule, and the power of the mother-in-law grows weak. To her is paid due\r\nrespect, but she seldom has the despotic control which often makes the\r\nbeginning of married life hard to the Japanese wife. These homes are\r\nsending out healthy influences that are daily having their effect, and\r\nraising the position of women in Japan.\r\n\r\nBut for the young girl whose mind has been broadened by the new\r\neducation, and who marries, as the majority of Japanese girls must, not\r\nin accordance with her own wishes, but in obedience to the will of her\r\nparents, a hard life is in store. A woman's education, under the old\r\nrégime, was one that fitted her well for the position that she was to\r\noccupy. The higher courses of study only serve to make her kick against\r\nthe pricks, and render herself miserable where she might before have\r\nbeen happy. With mind and character developed by education, she may be\r\nobliged to enter the home of her husband's family, to be perhaps one\r\namong many members under the same roof. In the training of her own\r\nchildren, in the care of her own health and theirs, her wishes and\r\njudgment must often yield to the prejudices of those above her, under\r\nwhose authority she is, and it may not be until many years have passed\r\nthat she will be in a position to influence in any measure the lives of\r\nthose nearest and dearest to her. Then, too, her life must be passed\r\nentirely within the home, with no opportunities to meet or to mingle\r\nwith the great world of which she has read and studied. Surely her lot\r\nis harder than that of the woman of the olden time, whose plain duty\r\nalways lay in the path of implicit obedience to her superiors, and who\r\nnever for one moment considered obedience to the dictates of her own\r\nreason and conscience as an obligation higher than deference to the\r\nwishes of husband and parents. Education, without further amelioration\r\nof their lot as wives and mothers, can but result in making the women\r\ndiscontented and unhappy,--in many cases injuring their health by worry\r\nover the constant petty disappointments and baffled desires of their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThis to superficial observers would seem a step backward rather than\r\nforward, and it is to this cause that the present reaction against\r\nfemale education may be traced. The first generation or two of educated\r\nwomen must endure much for the sake of those who come after, and by many\r\nthis vicarious suffering is misunderstood, and distaste on the part of\r\neducated girls for marriage, as it now exists in Japan, is regarded as\r\none of the sure signs that education is a failure. Without some change\r\nin the position of wife and mother, this feeling will grow into absolute\r\nrepugnance, if women continue to be educated after the Western fashion.\r\n\r\nThe second remedy that is suggested is Christianity, a remedy which is\r\neven now at work. Wherever one finds in Japan a Christian home, there\r\none finds the wife and mother occupying the position that she occupies\r\nall over Christendom. The Christian man, in choosing his wife, feels\r\nthat it is not an ordinary contract, which may be dissolved at any time\r\nat the will of the contracting parties, but that it is a union for life.\r\nConsequently, in making his choice he is more careful, takes more time,\r\nand thinks more of the personal qualities of the woman he is about to\r\nmarry. Thus the chances are better at the beginning for the\r\nestablishment of a happy home, and such homes form centres of influence\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land to-day. Christianity in\r\nthe future will do much to mould public sentiment in the right way, and\r\ncan be trusted as a force that is sure to grow in time to be a mighty\r\npower in the councils of the nation.\r\n\r\nOne more remedy might be suggested, as a preliminary to proper\r\nlegislation, or a necessary accompaniment of it, and that is, the\r\nopening of new avenues of employment for women, and especially for\r\nwomen of the cultivated classes. To-day marriage, no matter how\r\ndistasteful, is the only opening for a woman; for she can do nothing for\r\nher own support, and cannot require her father to support her after she\r\nhas reached a marriageable age. As new ways of self-support present\r\nthemselves, and a woman may look forward to making a single life\r\ntolerable by her own labor, the intelligent girls of the middle class\r\nwill no longer accept marriage as inevitable, but will only marry when\r\nthe suitor can offer a good home, kindness, affection, and security in\r\nthe tenure of these blessings. So far, there is little employment for\r\nwomen, except as teachers; but even this change in the condition of\r\nthings is forming a class, as yet small, but increasing yearly, of women\r\nwho enjoy a life of independence, though accompanied by much hard work,\r\nmore than the present life of a Japanese married woman. In this class we\r\nfind some of the most intelligent and respected of the women of new\r\nJapan; and the growth of this class is one of the surest signs that the\r\npresent state of the laws and customs concerning marriage and divorce\r\nis so unsatisfactory to the women that it must eventually be remedied,\r\nif the educated and intelligent of the men care to take for their wives,\r\nand for the mothers of their children, any but the less educated and\r\nless intelligent of the women of their own nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWIFE AND MOTHER.[*84]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young wife, when she enters her husband's home, is not, as in our\r\nown country, entering upon a new life as mistress of a house, with\r\nabsolute control over all of her little domain. Should her husband's\r\nparents be living, she becomes almost as their servant, and even her\r\nhusband is unable to defend her from the exactions of her mother-in-law,\r\nshould this new relative be inclined to make full use of the power given\r\nher by custom. Happy is the girl whose husband has no parents. Her\r\ncomfort in life is materially increased by her husband's loss, for,\r\ninstead of having to serve two masters, she will then have to serve only\r\none, and that one more kind and thoughtful of her strength and comfort\r\nthan the mother-in-law.\r\n\r\nIn Japan the idea of a wife's duty to her husband includes no thought of\r\ncompanionship on terms of equality. The wife is simply the housekeeper,\r\nthe head of the establishment, to be honored by the servants because she\r\nis the one who is nearest to the master, but not for one moment to be\r\nregarded as the master's equal. She governs and directs the household,\r\nif it be a large one, and her position is one of much care and\r\nresponsibility; but she is not the intimate friend of her husband, is in\r\nno sense his confidante or adviser, except in trivial affairs of the\r\nhousehold. She appears rarely with him in public, is expected always to\r\nwait upon him and save him steps, and must bear all things from him with\r\nsmiling face and agreeable manners, even to the receiving with open arms\r\ninto the household some other woman, whom she knows to bear the relation\r\nof concubine to her own husband.\r\n\r\nIn return for this, she has, if she be of the higher classes, much\r\nrespect and honor from those beneath her. She has, in many cases the\r\nreal though often inconsiderate affection of her husband. If she be the\r\nmother of children, she is doubly honored, and if she be endowed with a\r\ngood temper, good manners, and tact, she can render her position not\r\nonly agreeable to herself, but one of great usefulness to those about\r\nher. It lies with her alone to make the home a pleasant one, or to make\r\nit unpleasant. Nothing is expected of the husband in this direction; he\r\nmay do as he likes with his own, and no one will blame him; but if his\r\nhome is not happy, even through his own folly or bad temper, the blame\r\nwill fall upon his wife, who should by management do whatever is\r\nnecessary to supply the deficiencies caused by her husband's\r\nshortcomings. In all things the husband goes first, the wife second. If\r\nthe husband drops his fan or his handkerchief the wife picks it up. The\r\nhusband is served first, the wife afterwards, and so on through the\r\ncountless minutiæ of daily life. It is not the idea of the strong man\r\nconsidering the weak woman, saving her exertion, guarding and deferring\r\nto her; but it is the less important waiting upon the more important,\r\nthe servant deferring to her master.\r\n\r\nBut though the present position of a Japanese wife is that of a\r\ndependent who owes all she has to her protector, and for whom she is\r\nbound to do all she can in return, the dependence is in many cases a\r\nhappy one. The wife's position, especially if she be the mother of\r\nchildren, is often pleasant, and her chief joy and pride lies in the\r\nproper conduct of her house and the training of her children. The\r\nservice of her parents-in-law, however, must remain her first duty\r\nduring their lifetime. She must make it her care to see that they are\r\nwaited upon and served with what they like at meals, that their clothes\r\nare carefully and nicely made, and that countless little attentions are\r\nheaped upon them. As long as her mother-in-law lives, the latter is the\r\nreal ruler of the house; and though in many cases the elder lady prefers\r\nfreedom from responsibility to the personal superintendence of the\r\ndetails of housekeeping, she will not hesitate to require of her\r\ndaughter-in-law that the house be kept to her satisfaction. If the\r\nmaiden's lot is to be the first daughter-in-law in a large family, she\r\nbecomes simply the one of the family from whom the most drudgery is\r\nexpected, who obtains the fewest favors, and who is expected to have\r\nalways the pleasantest of tempers under circumstances not altogether\r\nconducive to repose of spirit. The wife of the oldest son has, however,\r\nthe advantage that, when her mother-in-law dies or retires, she becomes\r\nthe mistress of the house and the head lady of the family, a position\r\nfor which her apprenticeship to the old lady has probably exceptionally\r\nwell fitted her.\r\n\r\nNext to her parents-in-law, her duty is to her husband. She must herself\r\nrender to him the little services that a European expects of his valet.\r\nShe must not only take care of his clothing, but must bring it to him\r\nand help him put it on, and must put away with care whatever he has\r\ntaken off; and she often takes pride in doing with her own hands many\r\nacts of service which might be left to servants, and which are not\r\nactually demanded of her, unless she has no one under her to do them. In\r\nthe poorer families all the washing, sewing, and mending that is\r\nrequired is always done by the wife; and even the Empress herself is not\r\nexempt from these duties of personal service, but must wait upon her\r\nhusband in various ways.\r\n\r\nWhen the earliest beams of the sun shine in at the cracks of the dark\r\nwooden shutters which surround the house at night, the young wife in the\r\nfamily softly arises, puts out the feeble light of the _andon_,[15]\r\nwhich has burned all night, and, quietly opening one of the sliding\r\ndoors, admits enough light to make her own toilet. She dresses hastily,\r\nonly putting a few touches here and there to her elaborate coiffure,\r\nwhich she has not taken down for her night's rest.[16] Next she goes to\r\narouse the servants, if they are not already up, and with them prepares\r\nthe modest breakfast. When the little lacquer tables, with rice bowls,\r\nplates, and chopsticks are arranged in place, she goes softly to see\r\nwhether her parents and husband are awake, and if they have hot water,\r\ncharcoal fire, and whatever else they may need for their toilet. Then\r\nwith her own hands, or with the help of the servants, she slides back\r\nthe wooden shutters, opening the whole house to the fresh morning air\r\nand sunlight. It is she, also, who directs the washing and wiping of the\r\npolished floors, and the folding and putting away of the bedding, so\r\nthat all is in readiness before the morning meal.\r\n\r\n[15] The _andon_ is the standing lamp, inclosed in a paper case, used as\r\na night lamp in all Japanese houses. Until the introduction of kerosene\r\nlamps, the _andon_ was the only light used in Japanese houses. The light\r\nis produced by a pith wick floating in a saucer of vegetable oil.\r\n\r\n[16] The pillow used by ladies is merely a wooden rest for the head,\r\nthat supports the neck, leaving the elaborate head-dress undisturbed.\r\nThe hair is dressed by a professional hair-dresser, who comes to the\r\nhouse once in two or three days. In some parts of Japan, as in Ki[=o]to,\r\nwhere the hair is even more elaborately dressed than in T[=o]ky[=o], it is\r\nmuch less frequently arranged. The process takes two hours at least.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast is over, the husband starts for his place of business,\r\nand the little wife is in waiting to send him off with her sweetest\r\nsmile and her lowest bow, after having seen that his foot-gear--whether\r\nsandal, clog, or shoe--is at the door ready for him to put on, his\r\numbrella, book, or bundle at hand, and his _kuruma_ waiting for him.\r\n\r\nCertainly a Japanese man is lucky in having all the little things in his\r\nlife attended to by his thoughtful wife,--a good, considerate, careful\r\nbody-servant, always on hand to bear for him the trifling worries and\r\ncares. There is no wonder that there are no bachelors in Japan. To some\r\ndegree, I am sure, the men appreciate these attentions; for they often\r\nbecome much in love with their sweet, helpful wives, though they do not\r\nshare with them the greater things of life, the ambitions and the hopes\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nThe husband started on his daily rounds, the wife settles down to the\r\nwork of the house. Her sphere is within her home, and though, unlike\r\nother Asiatic women, she goes without restraint alone through the\r\nstreets, she does not concern herself with the great world, nor is she\r\noccupied with such a round of social duties as fill the lives of society\r\nwomen in this country. Yet she is not barred out from all intercourse\r\nwith the outer world, for there are sometimes great dinner parties,\r\ngiven perhaps at home, when she must appear as hostess, side by side\r\nwith her husband, and share with him the duty of entertaining the\r\nguests. There are, besides, smaller gatherings of friends of her\r\nhusband, when she must see that the proper refreshments are served, if\r\nthey be only the omnipresent tea and cake. She may, perhaps, join in the\r\nnumber and listen to the conversation; but if there are no ladies, she\r\nwill probably not appear, except to attend to the wants of her guests.\r\nThere are also lady visitors--friends and relatives--who come to make\r\ncalls, oftentimes from a distance, and nearly always unexpectedly,\r\nwhose entertainment devolves on the wife. Owing to the great distances\r\nin many of the cities, and the difficulties that used to attend going\r\nfrom place to place, it has become a custom not to make frequent visits,\r\nbut long ones at long intervals. A guest often stays several hours,\r\nremaining to lunch or dinner, as the case may be, and, should the\r\ndistance be great, may spend the night. So rigid are the requirements of\r\nJapanese hospitality that no guest is ever allowed to leave a house\r\nwithout having been pressed to partake of food, if it be only tea and\r\ncake. Even tradesmen or messengers who come to the house must be offered\r\ntea, and if carpenters, gardeners, or workmen of any kind are employed\r\nabout the house, tea must be served in the middle of the afternoon with\r\na light lunch, and tea sent out to them often during their day's work.\r\nIf a guest arrives in _jinrikisha_, not only the guest, but the\r\n_jinrikisha_ men must be supplied with refreshments. All these things\r\ninvolve much thought and care on the part of the lady of the house.\r\n\r\nIn the homes of rich and influential men of wide acquaintance, there is\r\na great deal going on to make a pleasant variety for the ladies of the\r\nhousehold, even although the variety involves extra work and\r\nresponsibility. The mistress of such a household sees and hears a great\r\ndeal of life; and her position requires no little wisdom and tact, even\r\nwhere the housewife has the assistance of good servants, capable, as\r\nmany are, of sharing not only the work, but the responsibility as well.\r\nClever wives in such homes see and learn much, in an indirect way, of\r\nthe outside world in which the men live; and may become, if they possess\r\nthe natural capabilities for the work, wise advisers and sympathizers\r\nwith their husbands in many things far beyond their ordinary field of\r\naction. An intelligent woman, with a strong will, has often been, unseen\r\nand unknown, a mighty influence in Japan. That her power for good or\r\nbad, outside of her influence as wife and mother, is a recognized fact,\r\nis seen in the circumstance that in novels and plays women are\r\nfrequently brought in as factors in political plots and organized\r\nrebellions, as well as in acts of private revenge.\r\n\r\nStill the life of the average woman is a quiet one, with little to\r\ninterrupt the monotony of her days with their never-ending round of\r\nduties; and to the most secluded homes only an occasional guest comes to\r\nenliven the dull hours. The principal occupation of the wife, outside of\r\nher housekeeping and the little duties of personal service to husband\r\nand parents, is needle-work. Every Japanese woman (excepting those of\r\nthe highest rank) knows how to sew, and makes not only her own garments\r\nand those of her children, but her husband's as well. Sewing is one of\r\nthe essentials in the education of a Japanese girl, and from childhood\r\nthe cutting and putting together of crêpe, silk, and cotton is a\r\nfamiliar occupation to her. Though Japanese garments seem very simple,\r\ncustom requires that each stitch and seam be placed in just such a way;\r\nand this way is something of a task to learn. To the uninitiated\r\nforeigner, the general effect of the loosely worn _kimono_ is the same,\r\nwhether the garment be well or ill made; but the skillful seamstress can\r\neasily discover that this seam is not turned just as it should be, or\r\nthat those stitches are too long or too short, or carelessly or unevenly\r\nset.\r\n\r\nFancy work[17] or embroidery is not done in the house, the gorgeous\r\nembroidered Japanese robes being the product of professional workmen.\r\nInstead of the endless fancy work with silks, crewels, or worsteds, over\r\nwhich so many American ladies spend their leisure hours, many of the\r\nJapanese ladies, even of the highest rank, devote much time to the\r\ncultivation of the silkworm. In country homes, and in the great cities\r\nas well, wherever spacious grounds afford room for the growth of\r\nmulberry trees, silkworms are raised and watched with care; an\r\nemployment giving much pleasure to those engaged in it.\r\n\r\n[17] The one exception to this statement, so far as I know, is the\r\nspecies of silk mosaic made by the ladies in the _daimi[=o]s'_ houses.\r\n(See chap. vii.)\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for any one who has not experimented in this direction\r\nto realize how tender these little spinners are. If a strong breeze blow\r\nupon them, they are likely to suffer for it, and the least change in the\r\natmosphere must be guarded against. For forty days they must be\r\ncarefully watched, and the great, shallow, bamboo basket trays\r\ncontaining them changed almost daily. New leaves for their food must be\r\ngiven frequently, and as the least dampness might be fatal, each leaf,\r\nin case of rainy weather, is carefully wiped. Then, too, the different\r\nages of the worms must be considered in preparing their food; as, for\r\nthe young worms, the leaves should be cut up, while for the older ones\r\nit is better to serve them whole. When, finally, the buzzing noise of\r\nthe crunching leaves has ceased, and the last worm has put himself to\r\nsleep in his precious white cocoon, the work of the ladies is ended; for\r\nthe cocoons are sent to women especially skilled in the work, by them to\r\nbe spun off, and the thread afterwards woven into the desired fabric.\r\nWhen at last the silk, woven and dyed, is returned to the ladies by\r\nwhose care the worms were nourished until their work was done, it is\r\nshown with great pride as the product of the year's labor, and if given\r\nas a present will be highly prized by the recipient.\r\n\r\nAmong the daily tasks of the housewife, one, and by no means the least\r\nof her duties, is to receive, duly acknowledge, and return in suitable\r\nmanner, the presents received in the family. Presents are not confined\r\nto special seasons, although upon certain occasions etiquette is rigid\r\nin its requirements in this matter, but they may be given and received\r\nat all times, for the Japanese are preëminently a present-giving nation.\r\nFor every present received, sooner or later, a proper return must be\r\nsent, appropriate to the season and to the rank of the receiver, and\r\nneatly arranged in the manner that etiquette prescribes. Presents are\r\nnot necessarily elaborate; callers bring fruit of the season, cake, or\r\nany delicacy, and a visit to a sick person must be accompanied by\r\nsomething appropriate. Children visiting in the family are always given\r\ntoys, and for this purpose a stock is kept on hand. The present-giving\r\nculminates at the close of the year, when all friends and acquaintances\r\nexchange gifts of more or less value, according to their feelings and\r\nmeans. Should there be any one who has been especially kind, and to whom\r\nreturn should be made, this is the time to do so.\r\n\r\nTradesmen send presents to their patrons, scholars to teachers, patients\r\nto their physicians, and, in short, it is the time when all obligations\r\nand debts are paid off, in one way or another. On the seventh day of\r\nthe seventh month, there is another general interchange of presents,\r\nalthough not so universal as at the New Year. It can easily be imagined\r\nthat all this present-giving entails much care, especially in families\r\nof influence; and it must be attended to personally by the wife, who, in\r\nthe secret recesses of her storeroom, skillfully manages to rearrange\r\nthe gifts received, so that those not needed in the house may be sent,\r\nnot back to their givers, but to some place where a present is due. The\r\npassing-on of the presents is an economy not of course acknowledged, but\r\nfrequently practiced even in the best families, as it saves much of the\r\notherwise ruinous expense of this custom.\r\n\r\nAs time passes by, occasional visits are paid by the young wife to her\r\nown parents or to other relatives. At stated times, too, she, and others\r\nof the family, will visit the tombs of her husband's ancestors, or of\r\nher own parents, if they are no longer living, to make offerings and\r\nprayers at the graves, to place fresh branches of the _sakaki_[18]\r\nbefore the tombs, and to see that the priests in charge of the cemetery\r\nhave attended to all the little things which the Japanese believe to be\r\nrequired by the spirits of the dead. Even these visits are often looked\r\nforward to as enlivening the monotony of the humdrum home life.\r\nSometimes all the members of the family go together on a pleasure\r\nexcursion, spending the day out of doors, in beautiful gardens, when\r\nsome one of the much-loved flowers of the nation is in its glory; and\r\nthe little wife may join in this pleasure with the rest, but more often\r\nshe is the one who remains at home to keep the house in the absence of\r\nothers. The theatre, too, a source of great amusement to Japanese\r\nladies, is often a pleasure reserved for a time later in life.\r\n\r\n[18] _Sakaki_, the _Cleyera Japonica_, a sacred plant emblematic of\r\npurity, and much used at funerals and in the decoration of graves.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese mother takes great delight and comfort in her children, and\r\nher constant thought and care is the right direction of their habits and\r\nmanners. She seems to govern them entirely by gentle admonition, and the\r\nseverest chiding that is given them is always in a pleasant voice, and\r\naccompanied by a smiling face. No matter how many servants there may be,\r\nthe mother's influence is always direct and personal. No thick walls\r\nand long passageways separate the nursery from the grown people's\r\napartments, but the thin paper partitions make it possible for the\r\nmother to know always what her children are doing, and whether they are\r\ngood and gentle with their nurses, or irritable and passionate. The\r\nchildren never leave the house, nor return to it, without going to their\r\nmother's room, and there making the little bows and repeating the\r\ncustomary phrases used upon such occasions. In the same way, when the\r\nmother goes out, all the servants and the children escort her to the\r\ndoor; and when her attendant shouts \"_O kaeri_,\" which is the signal of\r\nher return, children and servants hasten to the gate to greet her, and\r\ndo what they can to help her from her conveyance and make her\r\nhome-coming pleasant and restful.\r\n\r\nThe father has little to do with the training of his children, which is\r\nleft almost entirely to the mother, and, except for the interference of\r\nthe mother-in-law, she has her own way in their training, until they are\r\nlong past childhood. The children are taught to look to the father as\r\nthe head, and to respect and obey him as the one to whom all must defer;\r\nbut the mother comes next, almost as high in their estimation, and, if\r\nnot so much feared and respected, certainly enjoys a larger share of\r\ntheir love.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese mother's life is one of perfect devotion to her children;\r\nshe is their willing slave. Her days are spent in caring for them, her\r\nevenings in watching over them; and she spares neither time nor trouble\r\nin doing anything for their comfort and pleasure. In sickness,[19] in\r\nhealth, day and night, the little ones are her one thought; and from the\r\nhome of the noble to the humble cot of the peasant, this tender\r\nmother-love may be seen in all its different phases. The Japanese woman\r\nhas so few on whom to lavish her affection, so little to live for beside\r\nher children, and no hopes in the future except through them, that it is\r\nno wonder that she devotes her life to their care and service, deeming\r\nthe drudgery that custom requires of her for them the easiest of all her\r\nduties. Even with plenty of servants, the mother performs for her\r\nchildren nearly all the duties often delegated to nurses in this\r\ncountry. Mother and babe are rarely separated, night or day, during the\r\nfirst few years of the baby's life, and the mother denies herself any\r\nentertainment or journey from home when the baby cannot accompany her.\r\nTo give the husband any share in the baby-work would be an unheard-of\r\nthing, and a disgrace to the wife; for in public and in private the baby\r\nis the mother's sole charge, and the husband is never asked to sit up\r\nall night with a sick baby, or to mind it in any way at all. Nothing in\r\nall one's study of Japanese life seems more beautiful and admirable than\r\nthe influence of the mother over her children,--an influence that is\r\ngentle and all-pervading, bringing out all that is sweetest and noblest\r\nin the feminine character, and affording the one almost unlimited\r\nopportunity of a Japanese woman's life. The lot of a childless wife in\r\nJapan is a sad one. Not only is she denied the hopes and the pleasures\r\nof a mother in her children, but she is an object of pity to her\r\nfriends, and well does she know that Confucius has laid down the law\r\nthat a man is justified in divorcing a childless wife. All feel that\r\nthrough her, innocent though she is, the line has ceased; that her duty\r\nis unfulfilled; and that, though the name be given to adopted sons,\r\nthere is no heir of the blood. A man rarely sends away his wife solely\r\nwith this excuse, but children are the strongest of the ties which bind\r\ntogether husband and wife, and the childless wife is far less sure of\r\npleasing her husband. In many cases she tries to make good her\r\ndeficiencies by her care of adopted children; in them she often finds\r\nthe love which fills the void in her heart and home, and she receives\r\nfrom them in after-life the respect and care which is the crown of old\r\nage.\r\n\r\n[19] Since the introduction of the foreign system of medicine and\r\nnursing, the Japanese realize so acutely the lack of conveniences and\r\nappliances for nursing the sick in their own homes, that cases of severe\r\nor even serious illness are usually sent to hospitals, where the\r\ninvalids can have the comforts that even the wealthy Japanese homes\r\ncannot furnish.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto spoken of married life when the wife is received into\r\nher husband's home. Another interesting side of Japanese marriage is\r\nwhen a man enters the wife's family, taking her name and becoming\r\nentirely one of her family, as usually the wife becomes of the\r\nhusband's. When there are daughters but no sons in a family to inherit\r\nthe name, one of three things may happen: a son may be adopted early in\r\nlife and grow up as heir; or he may be adopted with the idea of marrying\r\none of the daughters; or, again, no one may have been formally adopted,\r\nbut on the eldest daughter's coming to a marriageable age, her family\r\nand friends seek for her a _y[=o]shi_, that is to say, some man (usually a\r\nyounger son) who is willing and able to give up his family name, and, by\r\nmarrying the daughter, become a member of her family and heir to the\r\nname. He cuts off all ties from his own family, and becomes a member of\r\nhers, and the young couple are expected to live with her parents. In\r\nthis case the tables are turned, and it is he who has to dread the\r\nmother-in-law; it is his turn to have to please his new relatives and to\r\ndo all he can to be agreeable. He, too, may be sent away and divorced by\r\nthe all-powerful parents, if he does not please; and such divorces are\r\nnot uncommon. Of course, in such marriages, the woman has the greater\r\npower, and the man has to remember what he owes her; and though the\r\nwoman yields to him obediently in all respects, it is an obedience not\r\ndemanded by the husband, as under other circumstances. In such marriages\r\nthe children belong to the family whose name they bear, so that in case\r\nof divorce they remain in the wife's family, unless some special\r\narrangement is made about them.\r\n\r\nIt may be wondered why young men ever care to enter a family as\r\n_y[=o]shi_. There is only one answer,--it is the attraction of wealth\r\nand rank, very rarely that of the daughter herself. In the houses of\r\nrich _daimi[=o]s_ without sons, _y[=o]shi_ are very common, and there\r\nare many younger sons of the nobility, themselves of high birth, but\r\nwithout prospects, who are glad enough to become great lords. In feudal\r\ntimes, the number of _samurai_ families was limited. Several sons of one\r\nfamily could not establish different _samurai_ families, but all but the\r\neldest son, if they formed separate houses, must enroll themselves among\r\nthe ranks of the common people. Hence the younger sons were often\r\nadopted into other _samurai_ families as _y[=o]shi_, where it was\r\ndesired to secure a succession to a name that must otherwise die out.\r\nSince the Restoration, and the breaking down of the old class\r\ndistinctions, young men care more for independence than for their rank\r\nas _samurai_; and it is now quite difficult to find _y[=o]shi_ to enter\r\n_samurai_ families, unless it be because of the attractiveness and\r\nbeauty of the young lady herself. Many a young girl who could easily\r\nmake a good marriage with some suitable husband, could she enter his\r\nfamily, is now obliged to take some inferior man as _y[=o]shi_, because\r\nfew men in these days are willing to change their names, give up their\r\nindependence, and take upon themselves the support of aged\r\nparents-in-law; for this also is expected of the _y[=o]shi_, unless the\r\nfamily that he enters is a wealthy one.\r\n\r\nFrom this custom of _y[=o]shi_, and its effect upon the wife's position,\r\nwe see that, in certain cases, Japanese women are treated as equal with\r\nmen. It is not because of their sex that they are looked down upon and\r\nheld in subjection, but it is because of their almost universal\r\ndependence of position. The men have the right of inheritance, the\r\neducation, habits of self-reliance, and are the bread-winners. Wherever\r\nthe tables are turned, and the men are dependents of the women, and\r\neven where the women are independent of the men,--there we find the\r\nrelations of men to women vastly changed. The women of Japan must know\r\nhow to do some definite work in the world beyond the work of the home,\r\nso that their position will not be one of entire dependence upon father,\r\nhusband, or son. If fathers divided their estates between sons and\r\ndaughters alike, and women were given, before the law, right to hold\r\nproperty in their own names, much would be accomplished towards securing\r\nthem in their positions as wives and mothers; and divorce, the great\r\nevil of Japanese home life to-day, would become simply a last resort to\r\npreserve the purity of the home, as it is in most civilized countries\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the women of the lower and those of the higher\r\nclasses, in the matter of equality with their husbands, is quite\r\nnoticeable. The wife of the peasant or merchant is much nearer to her\r\nhusband's level than is the wife of the Emperor. Apparently, each step\r\nin the social scale is a little higher for the man than it is for the\r\nwoman, and lifts him a little farther above his wife. The peasant and\r\nhis wife work side by side in the field, put their shoulders to the same\r\nwheel, eat together in the same room, at the same time, and whichever of\r\nthem happens to be the stronger in character governs the house, without\r\nregard to sex. There is no great gulf fixed between them, and there is\r\nfrequently a consideration for the wife shown by husbands of the lower\r\nclass, that is not unlike what we see in our own country. I remember the\r\ncase of a _jinrikisha_ man employed by a friend of mine in T[=o]ky[=o],\r\nwho was much laughed at by his friends because he actually used to spend\r\nsome of his leisure moments in drawing the water required for his\r\nhousehold from a well some distance away, and carrying the heavy buckets\r\nto the house, in order to save the strength of his little, delicate\r\nwife. That cases of such devotion are rare is no doubt true, but that\r\nthey occur shows that there is here and there a recognition of the\r\nclaims that feminine weakness has upon masculine strength.\r\n\r\nA frequent sight in the morning, in T[=o]ky[=o], is a cart heavily laden\r\nwith wood, charcoal, or some other country produce, creaking slowly\r\nalong the streets, propelled by a farmer and his family. Sometimes one\r\nwill see an old man, his son, and his son's wife with a baby on her\r\nback, all pushing or pulling with might and main; the woman with\r\ntucked-up skirts and tight-fitting blue trousers, a blue towel\r\nenveloping her head,--only to be distinguished from the men by her\r\nsmaller size and the baby tied to her back. But when evening comes, and\r\nthe load of produce has been disposed of, the woman and baby are seen\r\nseated upon the cart, while the two men pull it back to their home in\r\nsome neighboring village. Here, again, is the recognition of the law\r\nthat governs the position of woman in this country,--the theory, not of\r\ninferior position, but of inferior strength; and the sight of the women\r\nriding back in the empty carts at night, drawn by their husbands, is the\r\nthing that strikes a student of Japanese domestic life as nearest to the\r\ncustoms of our own civilization in regard to the relations of husbands\r\nand wives.\r\n\r\nThroughout the country districts, where the women have a large share in\r\nthe labor that is directly productive of wealth, where they not only\r\nwork in the rice fields, pick the tea crops, gather the harvests, and\r\nhelp draw them to market, but where they have their own productive\r\nindustries, such as caring for the silkworms, and spinning, and weaving\r\nboth silk and cotton, we find the conventional distance between the\r\nsexes much diminished by the important character of feminine labor; but\r\nin the cities, and among the classes who are largely either indirect\r\nproducers or non-producers, the only labor of the women is that personal\r\nservice which we account as menial. It is for this reason, perhaps, that\r\nthe gap widens as we go upward in society, and between the same social\r\nlevels as we go cityward.\r\n\r\nThe wife of the countryman, though she may work harder and grow old\r\nearlier, is more free and independent than her city sister; and the wife\r\nof the peasant, pushing her produce to market, is in some ways happier\r\nand more considered than the wife of the noble, who must spend her life\r\namong her ladies-in-waiting, in the seclusion of her great house with\r\nits beautiful garden, the plaything of her husband in his leisure hours,\r\nbut never his equal, or the sharer of his cares or of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes which must be mentioned as contributing to the\r\nlowering of the wife's position, among the higher and more wealthy\r\nclasses, lies in the system of concubinage which custom allows, and the\r\nlaw until quite recently has not discouraged. From the Emperor, who was,\r\nby the old Chinese code of morals, allowed twelve supplementary wives,\r\nto the _samurai_, who are permitted two, the men of the higher classes\r\nare allowed to introduce into their families these _mékaké_, who, while\r\nbeneath the wife in position, are frequently more beloved by the husband\r\nthan the wife herself. It must be said, however, to the credit of many\r\nhusbands, that in spite of this privilege, which custom allows, there\r\nare many men of the old school who are faithful to one wife, and never\r\nintroduce this discordant element into the household. Even should he\r\nkeep _mékaké_, it is often unknown to the wife, and she is placed in a\r\nseparate establishment of her own. And in spite of the code of morals\r\nrequiring submission in any case on the part of the woman, there are\r\nmany wives of the _samurai_ and lower classes who have enough spirit and\r\nwit to prevent their husbands from ever introducing a rival under the\r\nsame roof. In this way the practice is made better than the theory.\r\n\r\nNot so with the more helpless wife of the nobleman, for wealth and\r\nleisure make temptation greater for the husband. She submits\r\nunquestioningly to the custom requiring that the wife treat these women\r\nwith all civility. Their children she may even have to adopt as her own.\r\nThe lot of the _mékaké_ herself is rendered the less endurable, from the\r\nAmerican point of view, by the fact that, should the father of her child\r\ndecide to make it his heir, the mother is thenceforth no more to it than\r\nany other of the servants of the household. For instance, suppose a\r\nhitherto childless noble is presented with a son by one of his\r\nconcubines, and he decides by legal adoption to make that son his heir:\r\nthe child at its birth, or as soon afterwards as is practicable, is\r\ntaken from its mother and placed in other hands, and the mother never\r\nsees her own child until, on the thirtieth day after its birth, she goes\r\nwith the other servants of the household to pay her respects to her\r\nyoung master. If it were not for the habit of abject obedience to\r\nparents which Japanese custom has exalted into the one feminine virtue,\r\nfew women could be found of respectable families who would take a\r\nposition so devoid of either honor or satisfaction of any kind as that\r\nof _mékaké_. That these positions are not sought after must be said, to\r\nthe honor of Japanese womanhood. A nobleman may obtain _samurai_ women\r\nfor his \"_O mékaké_\" (literally, honorable concubines), but they are\r\nnever respected by their own class for taking such positions. In the\r\nsame way the _mékaké_ of _samurai_ are usually from the _héimin_. No\r\nwoman who has any chance of a better lot will ever take the unenviable\r\nposition of _mékaké_.\r\n\r\nA law which has recently been promulgated strikes at the root of this\r\nevil, and, if enforced, will in course of time go far toward extirpating\r\nit. Henceforth in Japan, no child of a concubine, or of adoption from\r\nany source, can inherit a noble title. The heir to the throne must\r\nhereafter be the son, not only of the Emperor, but of the Empress, or\r\nthe succession passes to some collateral branch of the family. This law\r\ndoes not apply to Prince Haru, the present heir to the throne, as,\r\nalthough he is not the son of the Empress, he was legally adopted\r\nbefore the promulgation of the law; but should he die, it will apply to\r\nall future heirs.\r\n\r\nThat public opinion is moving in the right direction is shown by the\r\nfact that the young men of the higher classes do not care to marry the\r\ndaughters of _mékaké_, be they ever so legally adopted by their own\r\nfathers. When the girls born of such unions become a drug in the\r\nmatrimonial market, and the boys are unable to keep up the succession,\r\nthe _mékaké_ will go out of fashion, and the real wife will once more\r\nassume her proper importance.[20]\r\n\r\n[20] It is worth while to mention in this connection the noteworthy\r\nefforts made by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Japan in\r\ncalling the attention of the public to this custom, and in arousing\r\npublic sentiment in favor of legislation against not only this system,\r\nbut against the licensed houses of prostitution. Though there has not\r\nyet been any practical result, much discussion has ensued in the\r\nnewspapers and magazines, lectures have been given, and much strong\r\nfeeling aroused, which may, before long, produce radical change.\r\n\r\nUpon the 11th day of February, 1889, the day on which the Emperor, by\r\nhis own act in giving a constitution to the people, limited his own\r\npower for the sake of putting his nation upon a level with the most\r\ncivilized nations of the earth, he at the same time, and for the first\r\ntime, publicly placed his wife upon his own level. In an imperial\r\nprogress made through the streets of T[=o]ky[=o], the Emperor and\r\nEmpress, for the first time in the history of Japan, rode together in\r\nthe imperial coach.[*115] Until then, the Emperor, attended by his chief\r\ngentlemen-in-waiting and his guards, had always headed the procession,\r\nwhile the Empress must follow at a distance with her own attendants.\r\nThat this act on the part of the Emperor signifies the beginning of a\r\nnew and better era for the women of Japan, we cannot but hope; for until\r\nthe position of the wife and mother in Japan is improved and made\r\nsecure, little permanence can be expected in the progress of the nation\r\ntoward what is best and highest in the Western civilization. Better\r\nlaws, broader education for the women, a change in public opinion on the\r\nsubject, caused by the study, by the men educated abroad, of the homes\r\nof Europe and America,--these are the forces which alone can bring the\r\nwomen of Japan up to that place in the home which their intellectual and\r\nmoral qualities fit them to fill. That Japan is infinitely ahead of\r\nother Oriental countries in her practices in this matter is greatly to\r\nher credit; but that she is far behind the civilized nations of Europe\r\nand America, not only in practice but in theory, is a fact that is\r\nincontestable, and a fact that, unless changed, must sooner or later be\r\na stumbling-block in the path of her progress toward the highest\r\ncivilization of which she is capable.[21] The European practice cannot\r\nbe grafted upon the Asiatic theory, but the change in the home must be a\r\nradical one, to secure permanent good results. As long as the wife has\r\nno rights which the husband is bound to respect, no great advance can\r\nbe made, for human nature is too mean and selfish to give in all cases\r\nto those who are entirely unprotected by law, and entirely unable to\r\nprotect themselves, those things which the moral nature declares to be\r\ntheir due. In the old slave times in the South, many of the negroes were\r\nbetter fed, better cared for, and happier than they are to-day; but they\r\nwere nevertheless at the mercy of men who too often thought only of\r\nthemselves, and not of the human bodies and souls over which they had\r\nunlimited power. It was a condition of things that could not be\r\nprevented by educating the masters so as to induce them to be kind to\r\ntheir slaves; it was a condition that was wrong in theory, and so could\r\nnot be righted in practice. In the same way the position of the Japanese\r\nwife is wrong in theory, and can never be righted until legislation has\r\ngiven to her rights which it still denies. Education will but aggravate\r\nthe trouble to a point beyond endurance. The giving to the wife power to\r\nobtain a divorce will not help much, but simply tend to weaken still\r\nfurther the marriage tie. Nothing can help surely and permanently but\r\nthe growth of a sound public opinion, in regard to the position of the\r\nwife, that will, sooner or later, have its effect upon the laws of the\r\ncountry. Legislation once effected, all the rest will come, and the\r\nwife, secure in her home and her children, will be at the point where\r\nher new education can be of use to her in the administration of her\r\ndomestic affairs and the training of her children; and where she will\r\nfinally become the friend and companion of her husband, instead of his\r\nmere waitress, seamstress, and housekeeper,--the plaything of his\r\nleisure moments, too often the victim of his caprices.\r\n\r\n[21] Many of the thinking men of Japan, though fully recognizing the\r\ninjustice of the present position of woman in society, and the necessity\r\nof reform in the marriage and divorce laws, refuse to see the importance\r\nof any movement to change them. Their excuse is, that such power in the\r\nhands of the husband over his wife might be abused, but that in fact it\r\nis not. Wrongs and injustice are rare, they argue, and kind treatment,\r\naffection, and even respect for the wife is the general rule; and that\r\nthe keeping of the power in the hands of the husband is better than\r\ngiving too much freedom to women who are without education. These men\r\nwish to wait until every woman is educated, before acting in a reform\r\nmovement, while many conservatives oppose the new system of education\r\nfor girls as making them unwomanly. Between these two parties, the few\r\nwho really wish for a change are utterly unable to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOLD AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Japanese woman is ashamed to show that she is getting along in years,\r\nbut all take pains that every detail of the dress and coiffure shall\r\nshow the full age of the wearer. The baby girl is dressed in the\r\nbrightest of colors and the largest of patterns, and looks like a gay\r\nbutterfly or tropical bird. As she grows older, colors become quieter,\r\nfigures smaller, stripes narrower, until in old age she becomes a little\r\ngray moth or plain-colored sparrow. By the sophisticated eye, a woman's\r\nage can be told with considerable accuracy by the various little things\r\nabout her costume,[22] and no woman cares to appear younger than her\r\nreal age, or hesitates to tell with entire frankness the number of years\r\nthat have passed over her head.\r\n\r\n[22] Children wear their hair on top of their heads while very young,\r\nand the manner of arranging it is one of the distinctive marks of the\r\nage of the child. The _marumagé_, the style of headdress of married\r\nladies, consisting of a large puff of hair on the top of the head,\r\ndiminishes in size with the age of the wearer until, at sixty or\r\nseventy, it is not more than a few inches in width. The number, size,\r\nand variety of ornamental hairpins, and the tortoise-shell comb worn in\r\nfront, all vary with the age.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this lies, at least in part, in the fact that every woman\r\nlooks forward to the period of old age as the time when she will attain\r\nfreedom from her life-long service to those about her,--will be in the\r\nposition of adviser of her sons, and director of her daughters-in-law;\r\nwill be a person of much consideration in the family, privileged to\r\namuse herself in various ways, to speak her own mind on most subjects,\r\nand to be waited upon and cared for by children and grandchildren, in\r\nreturn for her long years of faithful service in the household. Should\r\nher sight and other bodily powers remain good, she will doubtless\r\nperform many light tasks for the general good, will seldom sit idle by\r\nherself, but will help about the sewing and mending, the marketing,\r\nshopping, housework, and care of the babies, tell stories to her\r\ngrandchildren after their lessons are learned, give the benefit of her\r\nyears of experience to the young people who are still bearing the heat\r\nand burden of the day, and, by her prayers and visits to the temple at\r\nstated seasons, will secure the favor of the gods for the whole family,\r\nas well as make her own preparations for entry into the great unknown\r\ntoward which she is rapidly drifting. Is there wonder that the young\r\nwife, steering her course with difficulty among the many shoals and\r\nwhirlpools of early married life, looks forward with anticipation to the\r\nperiod of comparative rest and security that comes at the end of the\r\nvoyage? As she bears all things, endures all things, suffers long, and\r\nis kind, as she serves her mother-in-law, manages her husband's\r\nhousehold, cares for her babies, the thought that cheers and encourages\r\nher in her busy and not too happy life is the thought of the sunny calm\r\nof old age, when she can lay her burdens and cares on younger shoulders,\r\nand bask in the warmth and sunshine which this Indian Summer of her life\r\nwill bring to her.\r\n\r\nIn the code of morals of the Japanese, obedience to father, husband, or\r\nson is exalted into the chief womanly virtue, but the obedience and\r\nrespect of children, both male and female, to their parents, also\r\noccupies a prominent position in their ethical system. Hence, in this\r\nlatter stage of a woman's career, the obedience expected of her is\r\noften only nominal, and in any case is not so absolute and unquestioning\r\nas that of the early period; and the consideration and respect that a\r\nson is bound to show to his mother necessitates a care of her comfort,\r\nand a consultation of her wishes, that renders her position one of much\r\ngreater freedom than can be obtained by any woman earlier in life. She\r\nhas, besides, reached an age when she is not expected to remain at home,\r\nand she may go out into the streets, to the theatre, or other shows,\r\nwithout the least restraint or fear of losing her dignity.\r\n\r\nA Japanese woman loses her beauty early. At thirty-five her fresh color\r\nis usually entirely gone, her eyes have begun to sink a little in their\r\nsockets, her youthful roundness and symmetry of figure have given place\r\nto an absolute leanness, her abundant black hair has grown thin, and\r\nmuch care and anxiety have given her face a pathetic expression of quiet\r\nendurance. One seldom sees a face that indicates a soured temper or a\r\ncross disposition, but the lines that show themselves as the years go by\r\nare lines that indicate suffering and disappointment, patiently and\r\nsweetly borne. The lips never forget to smile; the voice remains always\r\ncheerful and sympathetic, never grows peevish and worried, as is too\r\noften the case with overworked or disappointed women in this country.\r\nBut youth with its hopeful outlook, its plans and its ambitions, gives\r\nway to age with its peaceful waiting for the end, with only a brief\r\nstruggle for its place; and the woman of thirty-five is just at the\r\npoint when she has bid good-by to her youth, and, having little to hope\r\nfor in her middle life, is doing her work faithfully, and looking\r\nforward to an old age of privilege and authority, the mistress of her\r\nson's house, and the ruler of the little domain of home.\r\n\r\nBut I have spoken so far only of those happy women whose sons grow to\r\nmaturity, and who manage to evade the dangerous reefs of divorce upon\r\nwhich so many lives are shipwrecked. What becomes of the hundreds who\r\nhave no children to rise up and call them blessed, but who have in old\r\nage to live as dependents upon their brothers or nephews? Even these,\r\nwho in this country often lead hard and unrewarded lives of toil among\r\ntheir happier relatives, find in old age a pleasanter lot than that of\r\nyouth. Many such old ladies I have met, whose short hair or shaven heads\r\nproclaim to all who see them that the sorrow of widowhood has taken from\r\nthem the joy that falls to other women, but whose cheerful, wrinkled\r\nfaces and happy, childlike ways have given one a feeling of pleasure\r\nthat the sorrow is past, and peace and rest have come to their declining\r\nyears. Fulfilling what little household tasks they can, respected and\r\nself-respecting members of the household, the _O B[)a] San_, or Aunty,\r\nis not far removed in the honor and affection of the children from the\r\n_O B[=a] San_, or Grandma, but both alike find a peaceful shelter in the\r\nhomes of those nearest and dearest to them.\r\n\r\nOne of the happiest old ladies I have ever seen was one who had had a\r\nrough and stormy life. The mother of many children, most of whom had\r\ndied in infancy, she was at last left childless and a widow. In her\r\nchildren's death the last tie that bound her to her husband's family was\r\nbroken, and, rather than be a burden to them, she made her home for many\r\nyears with her own younger brother, taking up again the many cares and\r\nduties of a mother's life in sharing with the mother the bringing up of\r\na large family of children. One by one, from the oldest to the youngest,\r\neach has learned to love the old aunty, to be lulled asleep on her back,\r\nand to go to her in trouble when mother's hands were too full of work.\r\nMany the caress received, the drives and walks enjoyed in her company,\r\nthe toys and candies that came out unexpectedly from the depths of\r\nmysterious drawers, to comfort many an hour of childish grief. That was\r\nyears ago, and the old aunty's hard times are nearly over. Hale and\r\nhearty at three-score years and ten, she has seen these children grow up\r\none by one, until now some have gone to new homes of their own. Her bent\r\nform and wrinkled face are ever welcome to her children,--hers by the\r\nright of years of patient care and toil for them. They now, in their\r\nturn, enjoy giving her pleasure, and return to her all the love she has\r\nlavished upon them. It is a joy to see her childlike pride and\r\nconfidence in them all, and to know that they have filled the place left\r\nvacant by the dead with whom had died all her hopes of earthly\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe old women of Japan,--how their withered faces, bent frames, and\r\nshrunken, yellow hands abide in one's memory! One seldom sees among them\r\nwhat we would call beauty, for the almost universal shrinking with age\r\nthat takes place among the Japanese covers the face with multitudinous\r\nwrinkles, and produces the effect of a withered russet apple; for the\r\nskin, which in youth is usually brightened by red cheeks and glossy\r\nblack hair, in old age, when color leaves cheek and hair, has a\r\ncuriously yellow and parchment-like look. But with all their wrinkles\r\nand ugliness, there is a peculiar charm about the old women of Japan.\r\n\r\nIn T[=o]ky[=o], when the grass grows long upon your lawn, and you send\r\nto the gardener to come and cut it, no boy with patent lawn-mower, nor\r\nstalwart countryman with scythe and sickle, answers your summons, but\r\nsome morning you awake to find your lawn covered with old women. The\r\nmuch-washed cotton garments are faded to a light blue, the exact match\r\nof the light blue cotton towels in which their heads are swathed, and on\r\nhands and knees, each armed with an enormous pair of shears, the old\r\nladies clip and chatter cheerfully all day long, until the lawn is as\r\nsmooth as velvet under their careful cutting. An occasional rest under a\r\ntree, for pipes and tea, is the time for much cheerful talk and gossip;\r\nbut the work, though done slowly and with due attention to the comfort\r\nof the worker, is well done, and certainly accomplished as rapidly as\r\nany one could expect of laborers who earn only from eight to twelve\r\ncents a day. Another employment for this same class of laborers is the\r\npicking of moss and grass from the crevices of the great walls that\r\ninclose the moats and embankments of the capital. Mounted on little\r\nladders, they pick and scrape with knives until the wall is clear and\r\nfresh, with no insidious growth to push the great uncemented stones out\r\nof their places.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with these humble but cheerful toilers may be mentioned\r\nanother class of women, often met with in the great cities. Dressed in\r\nrags and with covered heads and faces, they wander about the streets\r\nplaying the _samisen_ outside the latticed windows, and singing with\r\ncracked voices some wailing melody. As they go from house to house,\r\ngaining a miserable pittance by their weird music, they seem the\r\nembodiment of all that is hopeless and broken-hearted. What they are or\r\nwhence they come, I know not, but they always remind me of the\r\ngrasshopper in the fable, who danced and sang through the brief summer,\r\nto come, wailing and wretched, seeking aid from her thriftier neighbor\r\nwhen at last the winter closed in upon her.\r\n\r\nAs one rides about the streets, one often sees a little, white-haired\r\nold woman trotting about with a yoke over her shoulders from which are\r\nsuspended two swinging baskets, filled with fresh vegetables. The fact\r\nthat her hair is still growing to its natural length shows that she is\r\nstill a wife and not a widow; her worn and patched blue cotton clothes,\r\nbleached light from much washing, show that extreme poverty is her lot\r\nin life; and as she hobbles along with the gait peculiar to those who\r\ncarry a yoke, my thoughts are busy with her home, which, though poor and\r\nsmall, is doubtless clean and comfortable, but my eye follows her\r\nthrough the city's crowd, where laborer, soldier, student, and high\r\nofficial jostle each other by the way. Suddenly I see her pause before\r\nthe gateway of a temple. She sets her burden down, and there in the\r\nmidst of the bustling throng, with bowed head, folded hands, and moving\r\nlips, she invokes her god, snatching this moment from her busy life to\r\nseek a blessing for herself and her dear ones. The throng moves busily\r\non, making a little eddy around the burden she has laid down, but paying\r\nno heed to the devout little figure standing there; then in a moment the\r\nprayer is finished; she stoops, picks up her yoke, balances it on her\r\nshoulders, and moves on with the crowd, to do her share while her\r\nstrength lasts, and to be cared for tenderly, I doubt not, by children\r\nand children's children when her work is done.\r\n\r\nAnother picture comes to me, too, a picture of one whose memory is an\r\ninspiring thought to the many who have the honor to call her \"mother.\" A\r\nstately old lady, left a widow many years ago, before the recent changes\r\nhad wrought havoc preparatory to further progress, she seemed always to\r\nme the model of a mother of the old school. Herself a woman of thorough\r\nclassical education, her example and teaching were to both sons and\r\ndaughters a constant inspiration; and in her old age she found herself\r\nthe honored head of a family well known in the arts of war and peace, a\r\ngoodly company of sons and daughters, every one of them heirs of her\r\nspirit and of her intellect. Though conservative herself, and always\r\nclinging to the old customs, she put no block in the path of her\r\nchildren's progress, and her fine character, heroic spirit, and stanch\r\nloyalty to what she believed were worth more to her children than\r\nanything else could have been. Tried by war, by siege, by banishment, by\r\ndanger and sufferings of all kinds, to her was given at last an old age\r\nof prosperity among children of whom she might well be proud. Keeping\r\nher physical vigor to the end, and dying at last, after an illness of\r\nonly two days, her spirit passed out into the great unknown, ready to\r\nmeet its dangers as bravely as she had met those of earth, or to enjoy\r\nits rest as sweetly and appreciatively as she had enjoyed that of her\r\nold age in the house of her oldest son.\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with her was limited by our lack of common language, but\r\nwas a most admiring and appreciative one on my side; and I esteem it one\r\nof the chief honors of my stay in Japan, that upon my last meeting with\r\nher, two weeks before her death, she gave me her wrinkled but still\r\nbeautiful and delicately shaped hand at parting,--a deference to foreign\r\ncustoms that she only paid upon special occasions.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, amid such rain as Japanese skies know all too well how\r\nto let fall, I attended her funeral at the cemetery of Aoyama. The\r\ncemetery chapel was crowded, but a place was reserved for me, on account\r\nof special ties that bound me to the family, just behind the long line\r\nof white-robed mourners. In the Buddhist faith she had lived, and by the\r\nBuddhist ceremonial she was buried,--the chanted ritual, the gorgeously\r\nrobed priests, and the heavy smell of incense in the air reminding one\r\nof a Roman Catholic ceremony. The white wooden coffin was placed upon a\r\nbier at the entrance to the chapel, and when the priests had done their\r\nwork, and the ecclesiastical ceremony was over, the relatives arose, one\r\nby one, walked over to the coffin, bowed low before it, and placed a\r\ngrain of incense upon the little censer that stood on a table before\r\nthe bier, then, bowing again, retired to their places. Slowly and\r\nsolemnly, from the tall soldier son, his hair already streaked with\r\ngray, to the two-year-old grandchild, all paid this last token of\r\nrespect to a noble spirit; and after the relatives the guests, each in\r\nthe order of rank or nearness to the deceased, stepped forward and\r\nperformed the same ceremony before leaving the room. What the meaning of\r\nthe rite was, I did not know, whether a worship of strange gods or no;\r\nbut to me, as I performed the act, it only signified the honor in which\r\nI held the memory of a heroic woman who had done well her part in the\r\nworld according to the light that God had given her.\r\n\r\nJapanese art loves to picture the old woman with her kindly, wrinkled\r\nface, leaving out no wrinkle of them all, but giving with equal\r\ntruthfulness the charm of expression that one finds in them. Long life\r\nis desired by all as passionately as by ancient Hebrew poet and\r\npsalmist, and with good reason, for only by long life can a woman attain\r\nthe greatest honor and happiness. We often exclaim in impatience at the\r\nthought of the weakness and dependence of old age, and pray that we may\r\ndie in the fullness of our powers, before the decay of advancing years\r\nhas made us a burden upon our friends. But in Japan, dependence is the\r\nlot of woman, and the dependence of old age is that which is most\r\nrespected and considered. An aged parent is never a burden, is treated\r\nby all with the greatest love and tenderness; and if times are hard, and\r\nfood and other comforts are scarce, the children, as a matter of course,\r\ndeprive themselves and their children to give ungrudgingly to their old\r\nfather and mother. Faults there are many in the Japanese social system,\r\nbut ingratitude to parents, or disrespect to the aged, must not be named\r\namong them; and Young America may learn a salutary lesson by the study\r\nof the place that old people occupy in the home.\r\n\r\nIt is not only for the women of Japan, but for the men as well, that old\r\nage is a time of peace and happiness. When a man reaches the age of\r\nfifty or thereabouts, often while apparently in the height of his vigor,\r\nhe gives up his work or business and retires, leaving all the property\r\nand income to the care of his eldest son, upon whom he becomes entirely\r\ndependent for his support.[23] This support is never begrudged him, for\r\nthe care of parents by their children is as much a matter of course in\r\nJapan as the care of children by those who give them birth. A man thus\r\nrarely makes provision for the future, and looks with scorn on foreign\r\ncustoms which seem to betoken a fear lest, in old age, ungrateful\r\nchildren may neglect their parents and cast them aside. The feeling, so\r\nstrong in America, that dependence is of itself irksome and a thing to\r\nbe dreaded, is altogether strange to the Japanese mind. The married son\r\ndoes not care to take his wife to a new and independent home of his own,\r\nand to support her and her children by his own labor or on his own\r\nincome, but he takes her to his father's house, and thinks it no shame\r\nthat his family live upon his parents. But in return, when the parents\r\nwish to retire from active life, the son takes upon himself ungrudgingly\r\nthe burden of their support, and the bread of dependence is never\r\nbitter to the parents' lips, for it is given freely. To the time-honored\r\nEuropean belief, that a young man must be independent and enterprising\r\nin early life in order to lay by for old age, the Japanese will answer\r\nthat children in Japan are taught to love their parents rather than ease\r\nand luxury, and that care for the future is not the necessity that it is\r\nin Europe and America, where money is above everything else,--even\r\nfilial love. This habit of thought may account for the utter want of\r\nprovision for the future, and the disregard for things pertaining to the\r\naccumulation of wealth, which often strikes curiously the foreigner in\r\nJapan. A Japanese considers his provision for the future made when he\r\nhas brought up and educated for usefulness a large family of children.\r\nHe invests his capital in their support and education, secure of\r\nbountiful returns in their gratitude and care for his old age. It is\r\nhard for the men of old Japan to understand the rush and struggle for\r\nriches in America,--a struggle that too often leaves not a pause for\r\nrest or quiet pleasure until sickness or death overtakes the\r\nindefatigable worker. The _go inkyo_[24] of Japan is glad enough to lay\r\ndown early in life the cares of the world, to have a few years of calm\r\nand peace, undisturbed by responsibilities or cares for outside matters.\r\nIf he be an artist or a poet, he may, uninterrupted, spend his days with\r\nhis beloved art. If he is fond of the ceremonial tea, he has whole\r\nafternoons that he may devote to this æsthetic repast; and even if he\r\nhas none of these higher tastes, he will always have congenial friends\r\nwho are ready to share the _saké_ bottle, to join in a quiet smoke over\r\nthe _hibachi_, or to play the deep-engrossing game of _go_, or _shogi_,\r\nthe Japanese chess. To the Japanese mind, to be in the company of a few\r\nkindred souls, to spend the long hours of a summer's afternoon at the\r\nceremonial tea party, sipping tea and conversing in a leisurely manner\r\non various subjects, is an enjoyment second to none. A cultivated\r\nJapanese of the old times must receive an education fitting him\r\nespecially for such pursuits. At these meetings of friends,\r\nartistically or poetically inclined, the time is spent in making poems\r\nand exchanging wittily turned sentiments, to be read, commented on, and\r\nresponded to; or in the making of drawings, with a few bold strokes of\r\nthe brush, in illustration of some subject given out. Such enjoyments as\r\nthese, the Japanese believe, cannot be appreciated or even understood by\r\nthe practical, rush-ahead American, the product of the wonderful but\r\nmaterial civilization of the West.\r\n\r\n[23] It is this custom of going into early retirement that made it\r\npossible for the nobles in old times to keep the Emperor always a child.\r\nThe ruling Emperor would be induced to retire from the throne at the age\r\nof sixteen or twenty; thus making room for some baby, who would be in\r\nhis turn the puppet of his ambitious courtiers.\r\n\r\n[24] _Go Inkyo Sama_ is the title belonging to a retired old gentleman\r\nor old lady. _Inkyo_ is the name of the house or suite of rooms set\r\napart for such a person, and the title itself is made up of this word\r\nwith the Chinese honorific _go_ and the title _Sama_, the same as _San_,\r\nused in addressing all persons except inferiors.\r\n\r\nThus, amid enjoyments and easy labors suited to their closing years, the\r\nelder couple spend their days with the young people, cared for and\r\nprotected by them. Sometimes there will be a separate suite of rooms\r\nprovided for them; sometimes a little house away from the noises of the\r\nhousehold, and separated from the main building by a well-kept little\r\ngarden. In any case, as long as they live they will spend their days in\r\nquiet and peace; and it is to this haven, the _inkyo_, that all Japanese\r\nlook forward, as to the time when they may carry out their own\r\ninclinations and tastes with an income provided for the rest of their\r\ndays.[*137]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCOURT LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court of the Emperor was, in the early ages of Japan, the centre of\r\nwhatever culture and refinement the country could boast, and the\r\nemperors themselves took an active part in the promotion of\r\ncivilization. The earliest history of Japan is so wrapped in the mists\r\nof legend and tradition that only here and there do we get glimpses of\r\nheroic figures,--leaders in those early days. Demigods they seem,\r\nchildren of Heaven, receiving from Heaven by special revelation the\r\nwisdom or strength by means of which they conquered their enemies, or\r\ngave to their subjects new arts and better laws. The traditional\r\nemperors, the early descendants of the great Jimmu Tenno,[25] seem to\r\nhave been merely conquering chieftains, who by virtue of their descent\r\nwere regarded as divine, but who lived the simple, hardy life of the\r\nsavage king, surrounded by wives and concubines, done homage to by armed\r\nretainers and subject chiefs, but living in rude huts, and moving in and\r\nout among the soldiers, not in the least retired into the mysterious\r\nsolitude which in later days enveloped the Son of the Gods. The first\r\nemperors ruled not only by divine right, but by personal force and\r\nvalor; and the stories of the valiant deeds of these early rulers kept\r\nstrong the faith of the people in the divine qualities of the imperial\r\nhouse during the hundreds of years when the Emperor was a mere puppet in\r\nthe hands of ambitious and powerful nobles.\r\n\r\n[25] The Japanese claim for their present Emperor direct descent from\r\nJimmu Tenno, the Son of the Gods; and it is for this reason that the\r\nEmperor is supposed to be divine, and the representative of the gods on\r\nthe earth. The dynasty, for about twenty-five hundred years since Jimmu\r\nTenno, has never been broken. It must, however, be said in connection\r\nwith this statement, that the Japanese family is a much looser\r\norganization than that known to our Western civilization, on account of\r\nthe customs of concubinage and adoption, and that descent through family\r\nlines is not necessarily actual descent by blood.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of this legendary period, a figure comes into view that\r\nfor heroic qualities cannot be excelled in the annals of any\r\nnation,--Jingo K[=o]g[=o], the conqueror of Corea, who alone, among the\r\nnine female rulers of Japan, has made an era in the national history.\r\nShe seems to have been from the beginning, like Jeanne D'Arc, a hearer\r\nof divine voices; and through her was conveyed to her unbelieving\r\nhusband a divine command, to take ship and sail westward to the conquest\r\nof an unknown land. Her husband questioned the authenticity of the\r\nmessage, took the earthly and practical view that, as there was no land\r\nto be seen in the westward, there could be no land there, and refused to\r\norganize any expedition in fulfillment of the command; but for his\r\nunbelief was sternly told that he should never see the land, but that\r\nhis wife should conquer it for the son whom she should bear after the\r\nfather's death. This message from the gods was fulfilled. The Emperor\r\ndied in battle shortly after, and the Empress, after suppressing the\r\nrebellion in which her husband had been killed, proceeded to organize an\r\nexpedition for the conquest of the unknown land beyond the western sea.\r\nBy as many signs as those required by Gideon to assure himself of his\r\ndivine mission, the Empress tested the call that had come to her, but at\r\nlast, satisfied that the voices were from Heaven, she gave her orders\r\nfor the collection of troops and the building of a navy. I quote from\r\nGriffis the inspiring words with which she addressed her generals: \"The\r\nsafety or destruction of our country depends upon this enterprise. I\r\nintrust the details to you. It will be your fault if they are not\r\ncarried out. I am a woman and young. I shall disguise myself as a man,\r\nand undertake this gallant expedition, trusting to the gods and to my\r\ntroops and captains. We shall acquire a wealthy country. The glory is\r\nyours, if we succeed; if we fail, the guilt and disgrace shall be mine.\"\r\nWhat wonder that her captains responded to such an appeal, and that the\r\nwork of recruiting and shipbuilding began with a will! It was a long\r\npreparation that was required--sometimes, to the impatient woman, it\r\nseemed unnecessarily slow--but by continual prayer and offerings she\r\nappealed to the gods for aid; and at last all was ready, and the brave\r\narray of ships set sail for the unknown shore, the Empress feeling\r\nwithin her the new inspiration of hope for her babe as yet unborn.\r\nHeaven smiled upon them from the start. The clearest of skies, the most\r\nfavoring of breezes, the smoothest of seas, favored the god-sent\r\nexpedition; and tradition says that even the fishes swarmed in shoals\r\nabout their keels, and carried them on to their desired haven. The fleet\r\nran safely across to southern Corea, but instead of finding battles and\r\nstruggles awaiting them, the king of the country met them on the beach\r\nto receive and tender allegiance to the invaders, whose unexpected\r\nappearance from the unexplored East had led the natives to believe that\r\ntheir gods had forsaken them. The expedition returned laden with vast\r\nwealth, not the spoil of battle, but the peaceful tribute of a bloodless\r\nvictory; and from that time forward Japan, through Corea, and later by\r\ndirect contact with China itself, began to receive and assimilate the\r\ncivilization, arts, and religions of China. Thus through a woman Japan\r\nreceived the start along the line of progress which made her what she is\r\nto-day, for the sequel of Jingo K[=o]g[=o]'s Corean expedition was the\r\nintroduction of almost everything which we regard as peculiar to\r\ncivilized countries. With characteristic belittling of the woman and\r\nexalting of the man, the whole martial career of the Empress is\r\nascribed to the influence of her son as yet unborn,--a son who by his\r\nvalor and prowess has secured for his deified spirit the position of God\r\nof War in the Japanese pantheon. We should say that pre-natal influences\r\nand heredity produced the heroic son; the Japanese reason from the other\r\nend, and show that all the noble qualities of the mother were produced\r\nby the influence of the unborn babe.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of literature, art, and Buddhism, a change took\r\nplace in the relations of the court to the people. About the Emperor's\r\nthrone there gathered not only soldiers and governors, but the learned,\r\nthe accomplished, the witty, the artistic, who found in the Emperor and\r\nthe court nobles munificent patrons by whom they were supported, and\r\nbefore whom they laid whatever pearls they were able to produce. The new\r\nculture sought not the clash of arms and the shout of soldiers, but the\r\nquiet and refinement of palaces and gardens far removed from the noise\r\nand clamor of the world. And while emperors sought to encourage the new\r\nlearning and civilization, and to soften the warlike qualities of the\r\npeople about them, there was a frontier along which the savages still\r\nmade raids into the territory which the Japanese had wrested from them,\r\nand which it required a strong arm and a quick hand to guard for the\r\ndefense of the people. But the Emperor gradually gave up the personal\r\nleadership in war, and passed the duty of defending the nation into the\r\nhands of one or another of the great noble families. The nobles were not\r\nby any means slow to see the advantage to be gained for themselves by\r\nthe possession of the military power in an age when might made right,\r\neven more than it does to-day, and when force, used judiciously and with\r\nproper deference to the prejudices of the people, could be made to give\r\nto its possessor power even over the Emperor himself. And so gradually,\r\nin the pursuit of the new culture and the new religion, the emperors\r\nwithdrew themselves more and more into seclusion, and the court became a\r\nlittle world in itself,--a centre of culture and refinement into which\r\nfew excitements of war or politics ever came. While the great nobles\r\nwrangled for the possession of the power, schemed and fought and turned\r\nthe nation upside down; while the heroes of the country rose, lived,\r\nfought, and died,--the Emperor, amid his ladies and his courtiers, his\r\npriests and his literary men, spent his life in a world of his own;\r\nthinking more of this pair of bright eyes, that new and charming poem,\r\nthe other witty saying of those about him, than of the kingdom that he\r\nruled by divine right; and retiring, after ten years or so of puppet\r\nkinghood, from the seclusion of his court to the deeper seclusion of\r\nsome Buddhist monastery.\r\n\r\nWithin the sacred precincts of the court, much time was given to such\r\ngames and pastimes as were not too rude or noisy for the refinement that\r\nthe new culture brought with it. Polo, football, hunting with falcons,\r\narchery, etc., were exercises not unworthy of even the most refined of\r\ngentlemen, and certain noble families were trained hereditarily in the\r\nexecution of certain stately, antique dances, many of them of Chinese or\r\nCorean origin. The ladies, in trailing garments and with flowing hair,\r\nreaching often below the knees, played a not inconspicuous part, not\r\nonly because of their beauty and grace, but for their quickness of wit,\r\ntheir learning in the classics, their skill in repartee, and their\r\nquaint fancies, which they embodied in poetic form.[26]\r\n\r\n[26] In ancient times, before the long civil wars of the Middle Ages,\r\nmuch attention was given by both men and women to poetry, and many of\r\nthe classics of Japanese literature are the works of women. Among these\r\ndistinguished writers can be mentioned Murasaki Shikibu, Seish[=o] Nagon,\r\nand Iséno Taiyu, all court ladies in the time of the Emperor Ichij[=o]\r\n(about 1000 A. D.). The court at that time was the centre of learning,\r\nand much encouragement was given by the Emperor to literary pursuits,\r\nthe cultivation of poetry, and music. The Emperor gathered around him\r\ntalented men and women, but the great works that remain are, strange to\r\nsay, mostly those of women.\r\n\r\nMuch attention was given to that harmony of art with nature that the\r\nJapanese taste makes the _sine qua non_ of all true artistic effort. The\r\ngorgeously embroidered gowns must change with the changing season, so\r\nthat the cherry succeeds the plum, the wistaria the cherry, and so on\r\nthrough the whole calendar of flowers, upon the silken robes of the\r\ncourt, as regularly as in the garden that graces the palace grounds. And\r\nso with the confectionery, which in Japan is made in dainty imitation of\r\nflowers and fruits. The chrysanthemum blooms in sugar no earlier than\r\non its own stalk; the little golden orange, with its dark green leaves,\r\nis on the confectioner's list in winter, when the real orange is yellow\r\non its tree. The very decorations of the palace must be changed with the\r\nchanging of the months; and _kakémono_ and vase are alternately stored\r\nin the _kura_ and brought out to decorate the room, according as their\r\ndesigns seem in harmony with the mood of Nature. This effort to\r\nharmonize Nature and Art is seen to-day, not only in the splendid\r\nfurnishings of the court, but all through the decorative art of Japan.\r\nIn every house the decorations are changed to suit the changing seasons.\r\n\r\nThrough the years when Japan was adopting the civilization of China, a\r\ndanger threatened the nation,--the same danger that threatens it to-day:\r\nit was the danger lest the adoption of so much that was foreign should\r\nresult in a servile copying of all that was not Japanese, and lest the\r\nintroduction of literature, art, and numerous hitherto unknown luxuries\r\nshould take from the people their independence, patriotism, and\r\nmanliness. But this result was happily avoided; and at a time when the\r\nlanguage was in danger of being swept almost out of existence by the\r\nintroduction of Chinese learning through Chinese letters, the women of\r\nJapan, not only in their homes and conversation, but in the poetry and\r\nlighter literature of the country, preserved a strain of pure and\r\ngraceful Japanese, and produced some of the standard works of a\r\ndistinctly national literature. Favor at court to-day, as in the olden\r\ntimes, is the reward, not of mere rank, beauty, and grace of person, but\r\nmust be obtained through the same intellectual endowments, polished by\r\nyears of education, that made so many women famous in the mediæval\r\nhistory of Japan. Many court ladies have read much of their national\r\nliterature, so that they are able to appreciate the _bonmots_ which\r\ncontain allusions in many cases to old poems, or plays on words; and are\r\nable to write and present to others, at fitting times, those graceful\r\nbut untranslatable turns of phrase which form the bulk of Japanese\r\npoetry.[27] Even in this busy era of Méiji,[28] the Emperor and his\r\ncourt keep up the old-time customs, and strive to promote a love of the\r\nbeautiful poetry of Japan. At each New Year some subject appropriate to\r\nthe time is chosen and publicly announced. Poems may be written upon\r\nthis subject by any one in the whole realm, and may be sent to the\r\npalace before a certain date fixed as the time for closing the list of\r\ncompetitors. All the poems thus sent are examined by competent judges,\r\nwho select the best five and send them to the Emperor, an honor more\r\ndesired by the writers than the most favorable of reviews or the largest\r\nof emoluments are desired by American poets. Many of the other poems are\r\npublished in the newspapers. It is interesting to note that many of the\r\nprominent men and women of the country are known as competitors, and\r\nthat many of the court ladies join in the contest.\r\n\r\n[27] The court ladies in immediate contact with the Emperor and Empress\r\nare selected from the daughters of the nobles. Only in the present reign\r\nhave a few samurai women risen to high positions at court on account of\r\nspecial talents.\r\n\r\n[28] _Méiji_ (Enlightened Rule) is the name of the era that began with\r\nthe present Emperor's accession to the throne. The year A. D. 1890 is\r\nthe twenty-third year of Méiji, and would be so designated in all\r\nJapanese dates.\r\n\r\nThere are also, at the palace, frequent meetings of the poets and lovers\r\nof poetry connected with the court. At these meetings poems are\r\ncomposed for the entertainment of the Emperor and Empress, as well as\r\nfor the amusement of the poets themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the school recently established for the daughters of the nobles,\r\nunder the charge of the imperial household, much attention is given to\r\nthe work of thoroughly grounding the scholars in the Japanese language\r\nand literature, and also to making them skillful in the art of composing\r\npoetry. At the head of the school, in the highest position held by any\r\nwoman in the employ of the government, is a former court lady, who is\r\nsecond to none in the kingdom, not only in her knowledge of all that\r\nbelongs to court etiquette, but in her study of the history and\r\nliterature of her own people, and in her skill in the composition of\r\nthese dainty poems. A year or two ago, when one of the scholars in the\r\nschool died after a brief decline, her schoolmates, teachers, and school\r\nfriends wrote poems upon her death, which they sent to the bereaved\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for any Japanese, much more so for a foreigner, to\r\npenetrate into the seclusion of the palace and see anything of the life\r\nthere, except what is shown to the public in the occasional\r\nentertainments given at court, such as formal receptions and dinner\r\nparties. In 1889, the new palace, built on the site of the old Tokugawa\r\nCastle, burnt seventeen years ago, was finally completed; and it was my\r\nprivilege to see, before the removal of the court, not only the grand\r\nreception rooms, throne-room, and dining-room, but also the private\r\napartments of the Emperor and Empress. The palace is built in Japanese\r\nstyle, surrounded by the old castle moats, but there are many foreign\r\nadditions to the palace and grounds. It is heated and lighted in foreign\r\nstyle, and the larger rooms are all furnished after the magnificent\r\nmanner of European palaces; while the lacquer work, carvings, and\r\ngorgeous paneled ceilings remind one of the finest of Japanese temples.\r\nThe private apartments of the Emperor and Empress are, on the other\r\nhand, most simple, and in thorough Japanese style; and though the\r\nwoodwork and polished floors of the corridors are very beautiful, the\r\npaintings and lacquer work most exquisite, there is little in this\r\nsimplicity to denote the abode of royalty. It seems that their\r\nmajesties, though outwardly conforming to many European customs, and to\r\nthe European manner of dress, prefer to live in Japanese ways, on\r\nmatted, not carpeted floors, reposing on them rather than on chairs and\r\nbedsteads.[*152]\r\n\r\nTheir apartments are not large; each suite consisting of three rooms\r\nopening out of each other, the Empress's rooms being slightly smaller\r\nthan the Emperor's, and those of the young Prince Haru, the heir\r\napparent, again a little smaller. The young prince has a residence of\r\nhis own, and it is only on his visits that he occupies his apartments in\r\nhis father's palace. There are also rooms for the Empress dowager to\r\noccupy on her occasional visits. All of these apartments are quite close\r\ntogether in one part of the palace, and are connected by halls; but the\r\nprivate rooms of the court ladies are in an entirely separate place,\r\nquite removed, and only connected with the main building by a long,\r\nnarrow passageway, running through the garden. There, in the rooms\r\nassigned to them, each one has her own private establishment, where she\r\nstays when she is not on duty in attendance on the Emperor and Empress.\r\nEach lady has her own servants, and sometimes a younger sister or a\r\ndependent may be living there with her, though they are entirely\r\nseparate from the court and the life there, and must never be seen in\r\nany of the other parts of the building. In these rooms, which are like\r\nlittle homes in themselves, cooking and housekeeping are done, entirely\r\nindependent of the other parts of the great palace; and the tradesmen\r\nfind their way through some back gate to these little establishments,\r\nsupplying them with all the necessaries of life, as well as the\r\nluxuries.\r\n\r\nA court lady is a personage of distinction, and lives in comparative\r\nease and luxury, with plenty of servants to do all the necessary work.\r\nBesides her salary, which of course varies with the rank and the duties\r\nperformed, but is always liberal enough to cover the necessary expenses\r\nof dress, the court lady receives many presents from the Emperor and\r\nEmpress, which make her position one of much luxury.\r\n\r\nThe etiquette of the imperial household is very complicated and very\r\nstrict, though many of the formalities of the olden times have been\r\ngiven up. The court ladies are models of conservatism. In order to be\r\ntrained for the life there and its duties, they usually enter the court\r\nwhile mere children of ten or eleven, and serve apprenticeship to the\r\nolder members. In the rigid seclusion of the palace they are strictly,\r\nalmost severely, brought up, and trained in all the details of court\r\netiquette. Cut off from all outside influences while young, the little\r\ncourt maidens are taught to go through an endless round of formalities\r\nwhich they are made to think indispensable. These details of etiquette\r\nextend not only to all that concerns the imperial household, but to\r\ncurious customs among themselves, and in regard to their own habits.\r\nMany of these ideas have come down from one generation to another,\r\nwithin the narrow limits of the court, so that the life there is a\r\ncurious world in itself, and very unlike that in ordinary Japanese\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nBut among all the ladies of Japan to-day,--charming, intellectual,\r\nrefined, and lovely as many of them are,--there is no one nobler, more\r\naccomplished, more beautiful in life and character, than the Empress\r\nherself. The Emperor of Japan, though he may have many concubines, may\r\nhave but one wife, and she must be chosen out of one of the five highest\r\nnoble families.[29] Haru Ko, of the noble family of Ichij[=o], became\r\nEmpress in the year 1868, one year after her husband, then a boy of\r\nseventeen, had ascended the throne, and the very year of the overthrow\r\nof the Sh[=o]gunate,[30] and the restoration of the Emperor to actual\r\npower and the leading part in the government. Reared amid the deep and\r\nscholarly seclusion of the old court at Ky[=o]to, the young Empress\r\nfound herself occupying a position very different from that for which\r\nshe had been educated,--a position the duties and responsibilities of\r\nwhich grow more multifarious as the years go by. Instead of a life of\r\nrigid seclusion, unseeing and unseen, the Empress has had to go forth\r\ninto the world, finding there the pleasures as well as the duties of\r\nactual leadership. With the removal of the court to T[=o]ky[=o], and the\r\nreappearance of the Emperor, in bodily form, before his people, there\r\ncame new opportunities for the Empress, and nobly has she used them.\r\nFrom the time when, in 1871, she gave audience to the five little girls\r\nof the samurai class who were just setting forth on a journey to\r\nAmerica, there to study and fit themselves to play a part in the Japan\r\nof the future, on through twenty years of change and progress, the\r\nEmpress Haru Ko has done all that lay within her power to advance the\r\nwomen of her country.[*157] Many stories are afloat which show the\r\nlovable character of the woman, and which have given her an abiding\r\nplace in the affections of the people.\r\n\r\n[29] The Empresses of Japan are not chosen from any branch of the\r\nimperial family, but from among the daughters of the five of the great\r\n_kugé_, or court nobles, who are next in rank to the imperial princes.\r\nThe choice usually rests with the Emperor or his advisers, and would be\r\nnaturally given to the most worthy, whether in beauty or accomplishments.\r\nNo doubt one reason why the Empress is regarded as far below the Emperor\r\nis, that she is not of royal blood, but one of the subjects of the\r\nEmpire. In the old times, the daughters of the Emperor could never\r\nmarry, as all men were far beneath them in rank. These usually devoted\r\ntheir lives to religion, and as Shint[=o] priestesses or Buddhist nuns\r\ndwelt in the retirement of temple courts or the seclusion of cloisters.\r\n\r\n[30] Tokugawa Sh[=o]guns were the military rulers of the Tokugawa\r\nfamily, who held the power in Japan for a period of two hundred and\r\nfifty years. They are better known to Americans, perhaps, under the\r\ntitle of _Tycoon_ (Great Prince), a name assumed, or rather revived, to\r\nimpress the foreigners when Commodore Perry was negotiating in regard to\r\ntreaties. The Sh[=o]gun held the daimi[=o]s in forced subjection,--a\r\nsubjection that was shaken in 1862, and broken at last in the year 1868,\r\nwhen, by the fall of the Sh[=o]gunate, the Emperor was restored to\r\ndirect power over his people.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when the castle in T[=o]ky[=o] was burned, and the\r\nEmperor and Empress were obliged to take refuge in an old daimi[=o]'s\r\nhouse, a place entirely lacking in luxuries and considerably out of\r\nrepair, some one expressed to her the grief that all her people felt,\r\nthat she should have to put up with so many inconveniences. Her response\r\nwas a graceful little poem, in which she said that the narrowness of her\r\nabode would not limit her love for her people, and that for them she\r\nwould endeavor to explore wisely the unlimited fields of knowledge.\r\n\r\nUpon another occasion, when Prince Iwakura, one of the leaders of Japan\r\nin the early days of the crisis through which the country is still\r\npassing, lay dying at his home, the Empress sent him word that she was\r\ncoming to visit him. The prince, afraid that he could not do honor to\r\nsuch a guest, sent her word back that he was very ill, and unable to\r\nmake proper preparation to entertain an Empress. To this the Empress\r\nreplied that he need make no preparations for her, for she was coming,\r\nnot as an Empress, but as the daughter of Ichij[=o], his old friend and\r\ncolleague, and as such he could receive her. And then, setting aside\r\nimperial state and etiquette, she visited the dying statesman, and\r\nbrightened his last hours with the thought of how lovely a woman stood\r\nas an example before the women of his beloved country.\r\n\r\nMany of the charities and schools of new Japan are under the Empress's\r\nspecial patronage; and this does not mean simply that she allows her\r\nname to be used in connection with them, but it means that she thinks of\r\nthem, studies them, asks questions about them, and even practices little\r\neconomies that she may have the more money to give to them. There is a\r\ncharity hospital in T[=o]ky[=o], having in connection with it a training\r\nschool for nurses, that is one of the special objects of her care. Last\r\nyear she gave to it, at the end of the year, the savings from her own\r\nprivate allowance, and concerning this act an editorial from the \"Japan\r\nMail\" speaks as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The life of the Empress of Japan is an unvarying routine of faithful\r\nduty-doing and earnest charity. The public, indeed, hears with a certain\r\nlistless indifference, engendered by habit, that her Majesty has visited\r\nthis school, or gone round the wards at that hospital. Such incidents\r\nall seem to fall naturally into the routine of the imperial day's work.\r\nYet to the Empress the weariness of long hours spent in classrooms or in\r\nlaboratories, or by the beds of the sick, must soon become quite\r\nintolerable did she not contrive, out of the goodness of her heart, to\r\nretain a keen and kindly interest in everything that concerns the\r\nwelfare of her subjects. That her Majesty does feel this interest, and\r\nthat it grows rather than diminishes as the years go by, every one knows\r\nwho has been present on any of the innumerable occasions when the\r\npromoters of some charity or the directors of some educational\r\ninstitution have presented, with merciless precision, all the petty\r\ndetails of their projects or organizations for the examination of the\r\nimperial lady. The latest evidence of her Majesty's benevolence is,\r\nhowever, more than usually striking. Since the founding of the T[=o]ky[=o]\r\nCharity Hospital, where so many poor women and children are treated, the\r\nEmpress has watched the institution closely, has bestowed on it\r\npatronage of the most active and helpful character, and has contributed\r\nhandsomely to its funds. Little by little the hospital grew, extending\r\nits sphere of action and enlarging its ministrations, until the need of\r\nmore capacious premises--a need familiar to such undertakings--began to\r\nbe strongly felt. The Empress, knowing this, cast about for some means\r\nof assisting this project. To practice strict economy in her own\r\npersonal expenses, and to devote whatever money might thus be saved from\r\nher yearly income to the aid of the hospital, appears to have suggested\r\nitself to her Majesty as the most feasible method of procedure. The\r\nresult is, that a sum of 8,446 yen, 90 sen, and 8 rin has just been\r\nhanded over to Dr. Takagi, the chief promoter and mainstay of the\r\nhospital, by Viscount Kagawa, one of her Majesty's chamberlains. There\r\nis something picturesque about these sen and rin. They represent an\r\naccount minutely and faithfully kept between her Majesty's unavoidable\r\nexpenses and the benevolent impulse that constantly urged her to curtail\r\nthem. Such gracious acts of sterling effort command admiration and\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\nNot very long ago, on one of her visits to the hospital, the Empress\r\nvisited the children's ward, and took with her toys, which she gave with\r\nher own hand to each child there. When we consider that this hospital is\r\nfree to the poorest and lowest person in T[=o]ky[=o], and that twenty\r\nyears ago the persons of the Emperor and Empress were so sacred in the\r\neyes of the people that no one but the highest nobles and the near\r\nofficials of the court could come into their presence,--that even these\r\nhigh nobles were received at court by the Emperor at a distance of many\r\nfeet, and his face even then could not be seen,--when we think of all\r\nthis, we can begin to appreciate what the Empress Haru has done in\r\nbridging the distance between herself and her people so that the poorest\r\nchild of a beggar may receive a gift from her hand. In the country\r\nplaces to this day, there are peasants who yet believe that no one can\r\nlook on the sacred face of the Emperor and live.\r\n\r\nThe school for the daughters of the nobles, to which I have before\r\nreferred, is an institution whose welfare the Empress has very closely\r\nat heart, for she sees the need of rightly combining the new and the old\r\nin the education of the young girls who will so soon be filling places\r\nin the court. At the opening of the school the Empress was present, and\r\nherself made a speech to the scholars; and her visits, at intervals of\r\none or two months, show her continued interest in the work that she has\r\nbegun. Upon all state occasions, the scholars, standing with bowed heads\r\nas if in prayer, sing a little song written for them by the Empress\r\nherself; and at the graduating exercises, the speeches and addresses are\r\nlistened to by her with the profoundest interest. The best specimens of\r\npoetry, painting, and composition done by the scholars are sent to the\r\npalace for her inspection, and some of these are kept by her in her own\r\nprivate rooms. When she visits the class-rooms, she does not simply pass\r\nin and pass out again, as if doing a formal duty, but sits for half an\r\nhour or so listening intently, and watching the faces of the scholars\r\nas they recite. In sewing and cooking classes (for the daughters of the\r\nnobles are taught to sew and cook), she sometimes speaks to the\r\nscholars, asking them questions. Upon one occasion she observed a young\r\nprincess, a newcomer in the school, working somewhat awkwardly with\r\nneedle and thimble. \"The first time, Princess, is it not?\" said the\r\nEmpress, smiling, and the embarrassed Princess was obliged to confess\r\nthat this was her first experience with those domestic implements.\r\n\r\nSometimes in her leisure hours--and they are rare in her busy life--the\r\nEmpress amuses herself by receiving the little daughters of some\r\nimperial prince or nobleman, or even the children of some of the high\r\nofficials. In the kindness of her heart, she takes great pleasure in\r\nseeing and talking to these little ones, some of whom are intensely awed\r\nby being in the presence of the Empress, while others, in their\r\ninnocence, ignorant of all etiquette, prattle away unrestrainedly, to\r\nthe great entertainment of the court ladies as well as of the Empress\r\nherself. These visits always end with some choice toy or gift, which\r\nthe child takes home and keeps among her most valued treasures in\r\nremembrance of her imperial hostess. In this way the Empress relieves\r\nthe loneliness of the great palace, where the sound of childish voices\r\nis seldom heard, for the Emperor's children are brought up in separate\r\nestablishments, and only pay occasional visits to the palace, until they\r\nhave passed early childhood.[31]\r\n\r\n[31] The Emperor's children are placed, from birth, in the care of some\r\nnoble or high official, who becomes the guardian of the child. Certain\r\npersons are appointed as attendants, and the child with its retinue\r\nlives in the establishment of the guardian, who is supposed to exercise\r\nhis judgment and experience in the physical and mental training of the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThe present life of the Empress is not very different from that of\r\nEuropean royalty. Her carriage and escort are frequently met with in the\r\nstreets of T[=o]ky[=o] as she goes or returns on one of her numerous\r\nvisits of ceremony or beneficence. Policemen keep back the crowds of\r\npeople who always gather to see the imperial carriage, and stand\r\nrespectfully, but without demonstration, while the horsemen carrying the\r\nimperial insignia, followed closely by the carriages of the Empress and\r\nher attendants, pass by. The official Gazette announces almost daily\r\nvisits by the Emperor, Empress, or other members of the imperial family,\r\nto different places of interest,--sometimes to various palaces in\r\ndifferent parts of T[=o]ky[=o], at other times to schools, charitable\r\ninstitutions or exhibitions, as well as occasional visits to the homes\r\nof high officials or nobles, for which great preparations are made by\r\nthose who have the honor of entertaining their Majesties.\r\n\r\nAmong the amusements within the palace grounds, one lately introduced,\r\nand at present in high favor, is that of horseback-riding, an exercise\r\nhitherto unknown to the ladies of Japan. The Empress and her ladies are\r\nsaid to be very fond of this active exercise,--an amusement forming a\r\nstriking contrast to the quiet of former years.\r\n\r\nThe grounds about the palaces in T[=o]ky[=o] are most beautifully laid\r\nout and cultivated, but not in that artificial manner, with regular\r\nflower beds and trees at certain equal distances, which is seen so often\r\nin the highly cultivated grounds of the rich in this country. The\r\nlandscape gardening of Japan keeps unchanged the wildness and beauty of\r\nnature, and imitates it closely. The famous flowers, however, are, in\r\nthe imperial gardens, changed by art and cultivated to their highest\r\nperfection, blooming each season for the enjoyment of the members of the\r\ncourt. Especially is attention given to the cultivation of the imperial\r\nflower of Japan, the chrysanthemum; and some day in November, when this\r\nflower is in its perfection, the gates of the Akasaka palace are thrown\r\nopen to invited guests, who are received in person by the Emperor and\r\nEmpress. Here the rarest species of this favorite flower, and the oddest\r\ncolors and shapes, the results of much care and cultivation, are\r\nexhibited in spacious beds, shaded by temporary roofs of bamboo twigs\r\nand decorated with the imperial flags. This is the great chrysanthemum\r\nparty of the Emperor, and another of similar character is given in the\r\nspring under the flower-laden boughs of the cherry trees.\r\n\r\nIn these various ways the Empress shows herself to her people,--a\r\ngracious and lovely figure, though distant, as she needs must be, from\r\ncommon, every-day life. Only by glimpses do the people know her, but\r\nthose glimpses reveal enough to excite the warmest admiration, the most\r\ntender love. Childless herself, destined to see a child not her own,\r\nalthough her husband's, heir to the throne, the Empress devotes her\r\nlonely and not too happy life to the actual, personal study of the wants\r\nof daughters of her people, and side by side with Jingo,[32] the\r\nmajestic but shadowy Empress of the past, should be enshrined in the\r\nhearts of the women of Japan the memory of Haru Ko, the leader of her\r\ncountrywomen into that freer and happier life that is opening to them.\r\n\r\n[32] Jingo K[=o]g[=o], like many of the heroic, half mythical figures of\r\nother nations, has suffered somewhat under the assaults of the modern\r\nhistorical criticism. Many of the best Japanese historians deny that she\r\nconquered Corea; some go so far as to doubt whether she had right to the\r\ntitle of Empress; all are sure that much of romance has gathered about\r\nthe figure of this brave woman; but to the mass of the Japanese to-day,\r\nshe is still an actual historic reality, and she represents to them in\r\nfeminine form the Spirit of Japan. Whether she conquered Corea or no,\r\nshe remains the prominent female figure upon the border line where the\r\nold barbaric life merges into the newer civilization, just as the\r\npresent Empress, Haru Ko, stands upon the border line between the\r\nEastern and the Western modes of thought and life.\r\n\r\nEach marks the beginning of a new era,--the first, of the era of\r\ncivilization and morality founded upon the teachings of Buddha and\r\nConfucius; the second, of the civilization and morality that have sprung\r\nfrom the teachings of Christ. Buddhism and Confucianism were elevating\r\nand civilizing, but failed to place the women of Japan upon even as high\r\na plane as they had occupied in the old barbaric times. To Christianity\r\nthey must look for the security and happiness which it has never failed\r\nto give to the wives and mothers of all Christian nations.[*168]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN CASTLE AND YASHIKI.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seclusion of the Emperors and the gathering of the reins of\r\ngovernment into the hands of Sh[=o]guns was a gradual process, beginning\r\nnot long after the introduction of Chinese civilization, and continuing\r\nto grow until Iyéyas[)u], the founder of the Tokugawa dynasty, through his\r\ncode of laws, took from the Emperor the last vestige of real power, and\r\nperfected the feudal system which maintained the sway of his house for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years of peace.\r\n\r\n[33] _Yashiki_, or spread-out house, was the name given to the palace\r\nand grounds of a daimi[=o]'s city residence, and also to the barracks\r\noccupied by his retainers, both in city and country. In the city the\r\nbarracks of the samurai were built as a hollow square, in the centre of\r\nwhich stood the palace and grounds of their lord, and this whole place\r\nwas the daimi[=o]'s _yashiki_. In the castle towns the daimi[=o]'s\r\npalace and gardens stood within the castle inclosure, surrounded by a\r\nmoat, while the _yashikis_ of the samurai were placed without the moat.\r\nThey in turn were separated from the business part of the village\r\nsometimes by a second or third moat. By life in castle and _yashiki_ we\r\nmean the life of the daimi[=o], whether in city or country.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's court, with its literary and æsthetic quiet, its\r\nsimplicity of life and complexity of etiquette, was the centre of the\r\nculture and art of Japan, but never the centre of luxury. After the\r\ngrowth of the Tokugawa power had secured for that house and its\r\nretainers great hereditary possessions, the Emperor's court was a mere\r\nshadow in the presence of the magnificence in which the Tokugawas and\r\nthe daimi[=o]s chose to live. The wealth of the country was in the hands\r\nof those who held the real power, and the Emperor was dependent for his\r\nsupport upon his great vassal, who held the land, collected the taxes,\r\nmade the laws, and gave to his master whatever seemed necessary for his\r\nmaintenance in the simple style of the old days, keeping for himself and\r\nfor his retainers enough to make Yedo, the Tokugawa capital, the centre\r\nof a luxury far surpassing anything ever seen at the Emperor's own\r\ncourt. While the _kugé_, the old imperial nobility, formerly the\r\ngovernors of the provinces under the Emperors, lived in respectable but\r\noften extreme poverty at Ky[=o]to, the landed nobility, or daimi[=o]s,\r\nbrought, after many struggles, under the sway of the Tokugawas, built\r\nfor themselves palaces and pleasure gardens in the moated city of Yedo.\r\nAt Yedo with its castle, its gardens, its _yashikis_, and its\r\nfortifications, was established a new court, more luxurious, but less\r\nartistic and cultivated, than the old court of Ky[=o]to. In the various\r\nprovinces, too, at every castle town, a little court arose about the\r\ncastle, and the daimi[=o] became not only the feudal chief, but the\r\npatron of literature and art among his people, as the years went by\r\nfilling his _kura_ with choice works of art, in lacquer, bronze, silver,\r\nand pottery, to be brought out on special occasions. These nobles, under\r\na law of Iyémits[)u], the third of the Tokugawa line, were compelled to\r\nspend half of each year at the city of the Sh[=o]guns; and each had his\r\n_yashiki_, or large house and garden, in the city. At this house, his\r\nfamily must reside permanently, as hostages for the loyalty of their\r\nlord while away. The annual journeys to and from Yedo were events not\r\nonly in the lives of the daimi[=o]s and their trains of retainers, but\r\nin the lives of the country people who lived along the roads by which\r\nthey must travel. The time and style of each journey for each daimi[=o]\r\nwere rigidly prescribed in the laws of Iyémits[)u], as well as the\r\nbehavior of the country people who might meet the procession moving\r\ntowards Yedo, or returning therefrom. When some noble, or any member of\r\nhis family, was to pass through a certain section of the country, great\r\npreparations were made beforehand. Not only was traffic stopped along\r\nthe route, but every door and window had to be closed. By no means was\r\nany one to show himself, or to look in any way upon the passing\r\nprocession. To do so was to commit a profane deed, punishable by a fine.\r\nAmong other things, no cooking was allowed on that day. All the food\r\nmust be prepared the day before, as the air was supposed to become\r\npolluted by the smoke from the fires. Thus through crowded cities, full\r\nand busy with life, the daimi[=o] in his curtained palanquin, with\r\nnumerous retinue, would pass by; but wherever he approached, the place\r\nwould be as deserted and silent as if plague-stricken. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to add that these journeys, attended with so much ceremony\r\nand inconvenience to the people, were not as frequent as the trips now\r\ntaken, at a moment's notice, from one city to another, by these very\r\nsame men.\r\n\r\nOne story current in T[=o]ky[=o] shows the narrowing effect of such\r\nseclusion. A noble who had traveled into Yedo, across one of the large\r\nbridges built over the Sumida River, remarked one day to his companions\r\nthat he was greatly disappointed on seeing that bridge. \"From the\r\npictures,\" he said, \"which I have seen, the bridge seemed alive with\r\npeople, the centre of life and activity, but the artists must\r\nexaggerate, for not a soul was on the bridge when I passed by.\"\r\n\r\nThe castle of the Sh[=o]gun in Yedo, with its moats and fortifications,\r\nand its fine house and great _kura_, was reproduced on a small scale in\r\nthe castles scattered through the country; and as in Yedo the _yashikis_\r\nof the daimi[=o]s stood next to the inner moat of the castle, that the\r\nretainers might be ready to defend their lord at his earliest call, so\r\nin the provinces the _yashikis_ of the samurai occupied a similar\r\nposition about the daimi[=o]'s castle.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see that, as the Sh[=o]gun took away the military and\r\ntemporal power of the Emperor, making of him only a figure-head without\r\nreal power, so, to a certain degree, the daimi[=o] gave up, little by\r\nlittle, the personal control of his own province, the power falling into\r\nthe hands of ambitious samurai, who became the councilors of their lord.\r\nThe samurai were the learned class and the military class; they were and\r\nare the life of Japan; and it is no wonder that the nobles, protected\r\nand shielded from the world, and growing up without much education,\r\nshould have changed in the course of centuries from strong, brave\r\nwarriors into the delicate, effeminate, luxury-loving nobles of the\r\npresent day. Upon the loyalty and wisdom of the samurai, often upon some\r\none man of undoubted ability, rested the greatness of the province and\r\nthe prosperity of the master's house.\r\n\r\nThe life of the ladies in these daimi[=o]s' houses is still a living\r\nmemory to many of the older women of Japan; but it is a memory only, and\r\nhas given place to a different state of things. The Emperor occupies the\r\ncastle of the Sh[=o]gun to-day, and every daimi[=o]'s castle throughout\r\nthe country is in the hands of the imperial government. The old\r\npleasure gardens of the nobles are turned into arsenals, schools, public\r\nparks, and other improvements of the new era. But here and there one\r\nfinds some conservative family of nobles still keeping up in some\r\nmeasure the customs of former times; and daimi[=o]s' houses there are\r\nstill in T[=o]ky[=o], though stripped of power and of retainers, where\r\nlife goes on in many ways much as it did in the old days. In such a\r\nhouse as this, one finds ladies-in-waiting, of the samurai rank, who\r\nserve her ladyship--the daimi[=o]'s wife--in all personal service. In\r\nthe old days, the daughters of the samurai were eager for the training\r\nin etiquette, and in all that belongs to nice housekeeping, that might\r\nbe obtained by a few years of apprenticeship in a daimi[=o]'s house, and\r\ngladly assumed the most menial positions for the sake of the education\r\nand reputation to be gained by such training.\r\n\r\nThe wife and daughters of a daimi[=o] led the quietest of lives, rarely\r\npassing beyond the four great walls that inclose the palace with its\r\ngrounds. They saw the changes of the seasons in the flowers that bloomed\r\nin their lovely gardens, when, followed by numerous attendants, they\r\nslowly walked through the bamboo groves or under the bloom-laden boughs\r\nof the plum or cherry trees, forming their views of life, its pleasures,\r\nits responsibilities, and its meaning, within the narrow limits of the\r\ndaimi[=o]'s _yashiki_.\r\n\r\nTheir mornings were passed in the adorning of their own persons, and in\r\nthe elaborate dressing of their luxuriant hair; the afternoons were\r\nspent in the tea ceremony, in writing poetry, or the execution of a sort\r\nof silk mosaic that is a favorite variety of fancy work still among the\r\nladies of Japan.\r\n\r\nA story is told of one of the Tokugawa princesses that illustrates the\r\namusements of the Sh[=o]gun's daughters, and the pains that were taken\r\nto gratify their wishes, however unreasonable. The cherry-trees of the\r\ncastle gardens of T[=o]ky[=o] are noted for their beauty when in bloom\r\nduring the month of April. It is said that once a daughter of the\r\nTokugawa house expressed a wish to give a garden party amid the\r\nblossoming cherry-trees in the month of December, and nothing would do\r\nbut that her wishes must be carried out. Her retainers accordingly\r\nsummoned to their aid skillful artificers, who from pink and white\r\ntissue paper produced myriads of cherry blossoms, so natural that they\r\ncould hardly be distinguished from the real ones. These they fastened\r\nupon the trees in just such places as the real flowers would have chosen\r\nto occupy, and the happy princess gave her garden party in December\r\nunder the pink mist of cherry blooms.\r\n\r\nThe children of a daimi[=o]'s wife occupied her attention but little.\r\nThey were placed in the charge of careful attendants, and the mother,\r\nthough allowed to see them when she wished, was deprived of the pleasure\r\nof constant intercourse with them, and had none of the mother's cares\r\nwhich form so large a part of life to an ordinary Japanese woman.\r\n\r\nWhen we know that the average Japanese girl is brought up strictly by\r\nher own mother, and thoroughly drilled in obedience and in all that is\r\nproper as regards etiquette and the duties of woman, we can imagine the\r\nnarrowness of the education of the daimi[=o]'s poor little daughter,\r\nsurrounded, from early childhood, with numerous attendants of the\r\nstrictest sort, to teach her all that is proper according to the\r\nhighest and severest standards. Sometimes, by the whim or the indulgence\r\nof parents, or through exceptional circumstances in her surroundings, a\r\nsamurai's daughter became more independent, more self-reliant, or better\r\neducated, than others of her rank; but such opportunities never came to\r\nthe more carefully reared noble's daughter.\r\n\r\nFrom her earliest childhood, she was addressed in the politest and most\r\nformal way, so that she could not help acquiring polite manners and\r\nspeech. She was taught etiquette above all things, so that no rude\r\naction or speech would disgrace her rank; and that she should give due\r\nreverence to her superiors, courtesy to equals, and polite condescension\r\nto inferiors. She was taught especially to show kindness to the families\r\nunder the rule of her father, and was early told of the noble's duty to\r\nprotect and love his retainers, as a father loves and protects his\r\nchildren. From childhood, presents were made in her name to those around\r\nher, often without her previous knowledge or permission, and from them\r\nshe would receive profuse thanks,--lessons in the delights of\r\nbeneficence which could not fail to make their impression on the child\r\nprincess. Even to inferiors she used the polite language,[34] and never\r\nthe rude, brusque speech of men, or the careless phrases and expressions\r\nof the lower classes.\r\n\r\n[34] The Japanese language is full of expressions showing different\r\nshades of meaning in the politeness or respect implied. There are words\r\nand expressions which superiors in rank use to inferiors, or _vice\r\nversa_, and others used among equals. Some phrases belong especially to\r\nthe language of the high-born, just as there are common expressions of\r\nthe people. Some verbs in this extremely complex language must be\r\naltered in their termination according to the degree of honor in which\r\nthe subject of the action is held in the speaker's mind.\r\n\r\nThe education of the daimi[=o]'s daughter was conducted entirely at\r\nhome.[35] Instead of going out to masters for instruction, she was\r\ntaught by some one in the household,--one of her father's retainers, or\r\nperhaps a member of her own private retinue. Teachers for certain\r\nbranches came from outside, and these were not expected to give the\r\nlesson within a certain time and hurry away, but they would remain,\r\nconversing, sipping tea, and partaking of sweetmeats, until their noble\r\npupil was ready to receive them. Hospitality required that the teacher\r\nbe offered a meal after the lesson, and this meal etiquette would not\r\npermit him to refuse, so that both teacher and pupil must spend much\r\ntime waiting for each other and for the lesson.\r\n\r\n[35] The establishment of the peeress' school, mentioned in the last\r\nchapter, is a great innovation upon the old-time ways of many of the\r\naristocratic families.\r\n\r\nPursued in this leisurely way, the education of the noble's daughter\r\ncould not advance very rapidly, and it usually ended with an extremely\r\nearly marriage; and the girl wife would sometimes play with her doll in\r\nthe new home until the living baby took its place to the young mother.\r\n\r\nThe samurai women, who in one position or another were close attendants\r\non these noble ladies, performing for them every act of service, were\r\noften women of more than average intelligence and education. From\r\nchildhood to old age, the noble ladies were never without one or more of\r\nthese maids of honor, close at hand to help or advise. Some entered the\r\nservice in the lower positions for only a short period, leaving sooner\r\nor later to be married; for continued service in a daimi[=o]'s household\r\nmeant a single life. Many of them remained in the palace all their days,\r\nleading lives of devotion to their mistress; the comfort and ease of\r\nwhich hardly compensated for the endless formalities and the monotonous\r\nseclusion.\r\n\r\nEven the less responsible and more menial positions were not looked down\r\nupon, and the higher offices in the household were exceedingly\r\nhonorable. When, once in a long while, a day's leave of absence was\r\ngranted to one of these gentlewomen, and, loaded with presents sent by\r\nthe daimi[=o]'s lady, she went on her visit to her home, she was received\r\nas a greatly honored member of her own family. The respect which was\r\npaid to her knowledge of etiquette and dress was never lessened because\r\nof the menial services she might have performed for those of noble\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe lady who was the head attendant, and those in the higher positions,\r\nhad a great deal of power and influence in matters that concerned their\r\nmistress and the household; just as the male retainers decided for the\r\nprince, and in their own way, many of the affairs of the province. The\r\nfew conservative old ladies, the last relics of the numerous retainers\r\nthat once filled the castle, who still remain faithful in attendance in\r\nthe homes now deprived of the grandeur of the olden times, look with\r\nhorror upon the innovations of the present day, and sigh for the glory\r\nof old Japan. It is only upon compulsion that they give up many of the\r\nnow useless formalities, and resign themselves to seeing their once so\r\nhonored lords jostle elbow to elbow with the common citizen.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the horror of one old lady, attendant on a noble's\r\ndaughter of high rank, just entering the peeress' school, when it was\r\ntold her that each student must carry in her own bundle of books and\r\narrange them herself, and that the attendants were not allowed in the\r\nclassroom. The poor old lady was doubtless indignant at the thought that\r\nher noble-born mistress should have to perform even so slight a task as\r\nthe arranging of her own desk unaided.[*182]\r\n\r\nIn the daimi[=o]s' houses there was little of the culture or wit that\r\ngraced the more aristocratic seclusion of Ky[=o]to, and none of the\r\nduties and responsibilities that belonged to the samurai women, so that\r\nthe life of the daimi[=o]'s lady was perhaps more purposeless, and less\r\nstimulating to the noble qualities, than the lives of any other of the\r\nwomen of Japan. Surrounded by endless restrictions of etiquette, lacking\r\nboth the stimulus that comes from physical toil and that to be derived\r\nfrom intellectual exertion, the ladies of this class of the nobility\r\nsimply vegetated. There is little wonder that the nobles degenerated\r\nboth mentally and physically during the years when the Tokugawas held\r\nsway; for there was absolutely nothing in the lives of the women to fit\r\nthem to be the wives and mothers of strong men. Delicate, dainty,\r\nrefined, dexterous in all manner of little things but helpless to act\r\nfor themselves,--ladies to the inmost core of their beings, with\r\ninstincts of honor and of _noblesse oblige_ appearing in them from\r\nearliest childhood,--the years of seclusion, of deference from hundreds\r\nof retainers, of constant instruction in the duties as well as the\r\ndignities of their position, have produced an abiding effect upon the\r\nminds of the women of this aristocracy, and to-day even the youngest and\r\nsmallest of them have the virtues as well as the failings produced by\r\nnearly three centuries of training. They are lacking in force, in\r\nambition, in clearness of thought, among a nation abounding in those\r\nqualities; but the national characteristics of dignity, charming\r\nmanners, a quick sense of honor, and indomitable pride of race and\r\nnation, combined with a personal modesty almost deprecating in its\r\nhumility,--these are found among the daughters of the nobles developed\r\nto their highest extent. With the qualities of gentleness and delicacy\r\npossessed by these ladies, which make them shrink from rough contact\r\nwith the outer world, there are mingled the stronger qualities of moral\r\nand physical courage. A daimi[=o]'s wife, as befitted the wife of a\r\nwarrior and the daughter of long generations of brave men, never shrank\r\nfrom facing danger and death when necessary; and considered the taking\r\nof her own life an honorable and easy escape from being captured by her\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nTwo or three little ripples from the past broke into my life in\r\nT[=o]ky[=o], giving a little insight into those old feudal times, and\r\nthe customs that were common then, but that are now gone forever. A\r\nstory was told me in Japan by a lady who had herself, as a child,\r\nwitnessed the events narrated. It illustrates the responsibility felt by\r\nthe retainers for their lord and his house. A daimi[=o] fell into\r\ndisgrace with the Sh[=o]gun, and was banished to his own capital,--a\r\ncastle town several days' journey from Yedo,--as a punishment for some\r\noffense. The castle gates were closed, and no communication with the\r\nouter world allowed. During this period of disgrace, it happened that\r\nthe noble fell ill, and died quite suddenly before his punishment was\r\nended. His death under such circumstances was the most terrible thing\r\nthat could befall either himself or his family, as his funeral must be\r\nwithout the ordinary tokens of respect; and his tombstone, instead of\r\nbearing tribute to his virtues, and the favor in which he had been held\r\nby his lord, must be simply the monument of his disgrace. This being the\r\ncase, the retainers felt that these evils must be averted at any cost.\r\nKnowing that the Sh[=o]gun's anger was probably not so great as to make\r\nhim wish to bring eternal disgrace to their dead lord, they at once\r\ndecided to send a messenger to the Sh[=o]gun, begging for pardon on the\r\nplea of desperate illness, and asking the restoration of his favor\r\nbefore the approach of death. The death was not announced, but the floor\r\nof the room in which the man had died was lifted up, and the body let\r\ndown to the ground beneath; and through all the town it was announced\r\nthat the daimi[=o] was hopelessly ill. Forty days passed before the\r\nSh[=o]gun sent to the retainers the token that the disgrace was removed,\r\nand during all those forty days, in castle and barrack and village, the\r\nfiction of the daimi[=o]'s illness was kept up. As soon as the\r\nmessengers returned, the body was drawn up again through the floor and\r\nplaced on the bed; and all the retainers, from the least unto the\r\ngreatest, were summoned into the room to congratulate their master upon\r\nhis restoration to favor. One by one they entered the darkened room,\r\nprostrated themselves before the corpse, and uttered the formal words of\r\ncongratulation. Then when all, even to the little girl who, grown to\r\nwomanhood, told me the story, had been through the horrible ceremony, it\r\nwas announced that the master was dead,--that he had died immediately\r\nafter the return of the messenger with the good tidings of pardon. All\r\nobstacles being thus removed, the funeral was celebrated with due pomp\r\nand circumstance; and the tombstone of the daimi[=o] to-day gives no\r\nhint of the disgrace from which he so narrowly escaped.\r\n\r\nAnother instance very similar, throwing some light on the custom of\r\nadoption or _y[=o]shi_, referred to in a previous chapter, was the case of\r\na nobleman who died without children, and without an heir appointed to\r\ninherit his title. It would never have done, in sending in the official\r\nnotice of death, to be unable to name the legal head of the house and\r\nthe successor to the title. There was also no male relative to perform\r\nthe office of chief mourner at the funeral; and so the death of the\r\nnobleman was kept secret, and his house showed no signs of mourning\r\nduring a long period, until a son satisfactory to all the members of the\r\nhousehold had been adopted. When the legal notice of the adoption had\r\nbeen sent in, and the son received into the family as heir, then, and\r\nonly then, was the death of the lord announced, the period of mourning\r\nbegun, and the funeral ceremony performed.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion I was visiting a Japanese lady, who knew the interest\r\nthat I took in seeing and procuring the old-fashioned embroidered\r\n_kimonos_, which are now entirely out of style in Japan, and which can\r\nonly be obtained at second-hand clothing stores, or at private sale. My\r\nfriend said that she had just been shown an assortment of old garments\r\nwhich were offered at private sale by the heirs of a lady, recently\r\ndeceased, who had once been a maid of honor in a daimi[=o]'s house. The\r\nclothes were still in the house, and were brought in, in a great basket,\r\nfor my inspection. Very beautiful garments they were, of silk, crêpe,\r\nand linen, embroidered elaborately, and in extremely good order. Many of\r\nthem seemed not to have been worn at all, but had been kept folded away\r\nfor years, and only brought out when a fitting occasion came round at\r\nthe proper season of the year. As we turned over the beautiful fabrics,\r\na black broadcloth garment at the bottom of the basket aroused my\r\ncuriosity, and I pulled it out and held it up for closer inspection. A\r\ncurious garment it was, bound with white, and with a great white crest\r\n_appliqué_ on the middle of the back. Curious white stripes gave the\r\ncoat a military look, and it seemed appropriate rather to the wardrobe\r\nof some two-sworded warrior than to that of a gentlewoman of the old\r\ntype. To the question, How did such a coat come to be in such a place?\r\nthe older lady of the company--one to whom the old days were still the\r\nnatural order and the new customs an exotic growth--explained that the\r\ngarment rightfully belonged in the wardrobe of any lady-in-waiting in a\r\ndaimi[=o]'s house, for it was made to wear in case of fire or attack when\r\nthe men were away, and the women were expected to guard the premises.\r\nFurther search among the relics of the past brought to light the rest of\r\nthe costume: silk _hakama_, or full kilted trousers; a stiff, manlike\r\nblack silk cap bound with a white band; and a spear cover of broadcloth,\r\nwith a great white crest upon it, like the one on the broadcloth coat.\r\nThese made up the uniform which must be donned in time of need by the\r\nladies of the palace or the castle, for the defense of their lord's\r\nproperty. They had been folded away for twenty years among the\r\nembroidered robes, to come to light at last for the purpose of showing\r\nto a foreigner a phase of the old life that was so much a matter of\r\ncourse to the older Japanese that it never occurred to them even to\r\nmention it to a stranger. The elder lady of the house was wonderfully\r\namused at my interest in these mute memorials of the past, and could\r\nnever comprehend why I was willing to expend the sum of one dollar for\r\nthe sake of gaining possession of a set of garments for which I could\r\nhave no possible use. The uniform had probably never been worn in actual\r\nwarfare, but its owner had been trained in the use of the long-handled\r\nspear, the cover of which she had kept stored away all these years; and\r\nhad regarded herself as liable to be called into action at any time as\r\none of the home guard, when the male retainers of her lord were in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThere are in the shops of T[=o]ky[=o] to-day hundreds of colored prints\r\nillustrating the splendor of the Sh[=o]gunate; for the fine clothes, the\r\npageants, the show and display that ended with the fall of the house of\r\nTokugawa, are still dear to the popular mind. In these one sees\r\nreproduced, in more than their original brilliancy of coloring, the\r\ndaimi[=o]s, with their trains of uniformed retainers, proceeding in\r\nstately pageant to the palace of the Sh[=o]gun; the games, the dances,\r\nthe reviews held before the Sh[=o]gun himself; the princess, with her\r\ntrain of ladies and attendants, visiting the cherry blossoms at Uyéno,\r\nor crossing some swift but shallow river on her journey to Yedo. There\r\none sees the fleet of red-lacquered pleasure barges in which the\r\nSh[=o]gun with his court sailed up the river to Muk[=o]jima, in the\r\nspring, to view the cherry-trees which bloom along the banks for miles.\r\nOne sees, too, the interiors of the daimi[=o]s' houses, the intimate\r\ndomestic scenes into which no outsider could ever penetrate. One picture\r\nshows the excitements consequent upon the advent of an heir to a noble\r\nhouse,--the happy mother on her couch, surrounded by brightly dressed\r\nladies-in-waiting; the baby in the room adjoining; another group of\r\nbrilliant beings preparing his bath; while down the long piazza, which\r\nopens upon the little courtyard in the centre of the house, one sees\r\nstill other groups of servants, bringing the gifts with which the great\r\nmansion is flooded at such a time. Still further away, across the\r\ncourtyard, are the doctors, holding learned consultation around a\r\nlittle table, and mixing medicines to secure the health and strength of\r\nboth mother and baby.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Sh[=o]gunate, and the abolition of castle and _yashiki_,\r\nhave made a radical change in the fashions of dress in Japan. One sees\r\nno longer the beautiful embroidered robes, except upon the stage, for\r\nthe abolition of the great leisure class has put the flowered _kimono_\r\nout of fashion. There are no courts, small and great, scattered all\r\nthrough the country, where the ladies must be dressed in changing styles\r\nfor the changing seasons, and where the embroideries that imitate most\r\nclosely the natural flowers are sure of a market. When one asks, as\r\nevery foreigner is likely to ask, the Japanese ladies of one's\r\nacquaintance, \"Why have you given up the beautiful embroideries and\r\ngorgeous colors that you used to wear?\" the answer always is, \"There are\r\nno daimi[=o]s' houses now.\" And this is regarded as a sufficient\r\nexplanation of the change.[*192]\r\n\r\nI have in my possession to-day two dainty bits of the silk mosaic work\r\nbefore mentioned, the work of the sixteen-year-old wife of one of the\r\nproudest and most conservative of the present generation of nobles. A\r\ndainty little creature she was, with a face upon which her two years of\r\nwifehood and one year of motherhood had left no trace of care. Living\r\namid her host of ladies and women servants, most of them older and wiser\r\nthan herself; having no care and no amusements save the easy task of\r\nkeeping herself pretty and well-dressed, and the amusement of watching\r\nher baby grow, and hearing the chance rumors that might come to her from\r\nthe great new world into which her husband daily went, but with which\r\nshe herself never mingled,--her days were one pleasant, monotonous\r\nround, unawakening alike either to soul or intellect. Into this life of\r\nremoteness from all that belongs to the new era, imagine the excitement\r\nproduced by the advent of a foreign lady, with an educated dog, whose\r\nwonderful intelligence had been already related to her by one of her own\r\nladies-in-waiting. I shall always believe that my invitation into that\r\nexclusive house was due largely to the reports of my dog, carried to its\r\nproprietors by one of the lady servitors who had seen him perform upon\r\none occasion. Certain it is that the first words of the little lady of\r\nthe house to me were a question about the dog; and her last act of\r\npoliteness to our party was a warm embrace of the handsome collie, who\r\nhad given unimpeachable evidence that he understood a great deal of\r\nEnglish,--a tongue which the daimi[=o] himself was painfully learning. The\r\ndainty child-wife with both arms buried in the heavy ruff of the\r\nastonished dog is a picture that comes to me often, and that brings up\r\nmost pathetically the monotony of an existence into which so small a\r\nthing can bring so much. The lifelike black and white silk puppy, the\r\ncreeping baby doll from Ky[=o]to, the silk mosaic box and chopstick\r\ncase,--the work of my lady's delicate fingers,--are most agreeable\r\nreminders of the kindness and sweetness of the little wife, whose\r\nsixteen summers have been spent among the surroundings of thirty years\r\nago, and who lives, like the enchanted princess of the fairy tales,\r\nwrapped about by a spell which separates her from the bustling world of\r\nto-day. The product of the past,--the daughter of the last of the\r\nSh[=o]guns,--she dwells in her enchanted house, among the relics of a past\r\nwhich is still the present to her and to her household. So lovely, so\r\næsthetic, so dainty and charming seems the world into which one enters\r\nthere, that one would not care to break the spell that holds it as it\r\nis, and let the girl-wife, with her gentlewomen and her kneeling\r\nservants, hurry forward into the busy, perplexing life of to-day. May\r\ntime deal gently with her and hers, nor rudely break the enchantment\r\nthat surrounds her!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSAMURAI WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamurai was the name given to the military class among the Japanese,--a\r\nclass intermediate between the Emperor and his nobles and the great mass\r\nof the common people who were engaged in agriculture, mechanical arts,\r\nor trade. Upon the samurai rested the defense of the country from\r\nenemies at home or abroad, as well as the preservation of literature and\r\nlearning, and the conduct of all official business. At the time of the\r\nfall of feudalism, there were, among the thirty-four millions of\r\nJapanese, about two million samurai; and in this class, in the broadest\r\nsense of the word, must be included the daimi[=o]s, as well as their\r\ntwo-sworded retainers. But as the greater among the samurai were\r\ndistinguished by special class names, the word as commonly used, and as\r\nused throughout this work, applies to the military class, who served\r\nthe Sh[=o]gun and the daimi[=o]s, and who were supported by yearly\r\nallowances from the treasuries of their lords. These form a distinct\r\nclass, actuated by motives quite different from those of the lower\r\nclasses, and filling a great place in the history of the country. As the\r\nnobility, through long inheritance of power and wealth, became weak in\r\nbody and mind, the samurai grew to be, more and more, not only the\r\nsword, but the brain of Japan; and to-day the great work of bringing the\r\ncountry out of the middle ages into the nineteenth century is being\r\nperformed by the samurai more than by any other class.\r\n\r\nWhat, it may be asked, are the traits of the samurai which distinguish\r\nthem, and make them such honored types of the perfect Japanese\r\ngentleman, so that to live and die worthy the name of samurai was the\r\nhighest ambition of the soldier? The samurai's duty may be expressed in\r\none word, loyalty,--loyalty to his lord and master, and loyalty to his\r\ncountry,--loyalty so true and deep that for it all human ties, hopes,\r\nand affections, wife, children, and home, must be sacrificed if\r\nnecessary. Those who have read the tale of \"The Loyal R[=o]nins\"[36]--a\r\nstory which has been so well told by Mitford, Dickins, and Greey that\r\nmany readers must be already familiar with it--will remember that the\r\nhead councilor and retainer, Oishi, in his deep desire for revenge for\r\nhis lord's unjust death, divorces his wife and sends off his children,\r\nthat they may not distract his thoughts from his plans; and performs his\r\nfamous act of revenge without once seeing his wife, only letting her\r\nknow at his death his faithfulness to her and the true cause of his\r\nseeming cruelty. And the wife, far from feeling wronged by such an act,\r\nonly glories in the loyalty of her husband, who threw aside everything\r\nto fulfill his one great duty, even though she herself was his unhappy\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n[36] _R[=o]nin_ was the term applied to a samurai who had lost his master,\r\nand owed no feudal allegiance to any daimi[=o]. The exact meaning of the\r\nword is _wave-man_, signifying one who wanders to and fro without\r\npurpose, like a wave driven by the wind.\r\n\r\nThe true samurai is always brave, never fearing death or suffering in\r\nany form. Life and death are alike to him, if no disgrace is attached to\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nAn incident comes into my mind which may serve as an example of the\r\nsamurai spirit,--a spirit which has filled the history of Japan with\r\nheroic deeds. It is the story of a long siege, at the end of which the\r\nlittle garrison in the besieged castle was reduced to the last stages of\r\nendurance, though hourly expecting reinforcement. In this state of\r\naffairs, the great question is, whether to wait for the expected aid, or\r\nto surrender immediately, and the answer to the question can only be\r\nobtained through a knowledge of the enemy's strength. At this juncture,\r\none of the samurai volunteers to steal into the camp of the besiegers,\r\ninspect their forces, and report their strength before the final\r\ndecision is made. He disguises himself, and through various chances is\r\nable to penetrate, unsuspected, into the midst of the enemy's camp. He\r\ndiscovers that the besiegers are so weak that they cannot maintain the\r\nsiege much longer, but while returning to the castle he is recognized\r\nand taken by the enemy. His captors give him one chance for escape from\r\nthe horrible death of crucifixion. He is to go to the edge of the moat,\r\nand, standing on an elevated place, shout out to the soldiers that they\r\nmust surrender, for the forces are too strong for them. He seemingly\r\nconsents to this, and, led down to the water's edge, he sees across the\r\nmoat his wife and child, who greet him with demonstrations of joy. To\r\nher he waves his hand; then, bravely and loudly, so that it may be heard\r\nby friend and foe, he shouts out the true tidings, \"Wait for\r\nreinforcement at any cost, for the besiegers are weak and will soon have\r\nto give up.\" At these words his enraged enemies seize him and put him to\r\na death of horrible torture, but he smiles in their faces as he tells\r\nthem the sweetness of such a sacrifice for his master. Japanese history\r\nabounds with heroic deeds of blood displaying the indomitable courage of\r\nthe samurai. In the reading of them, we are often reminded of the\r\nSpartan spirit of warfare, and samurai women are in some ways very like\r\nthose Spartan mothers who would rather die than see their sons branded\r\nas cowards.\r\n\r\nThe implicit obedience which samurai gave their lords, when conflicting\r\nwith feelings of loyalty to their country, often produced two opposing\r\nforces which had to be overcome. When the daimi[=o] gave orders that the\r\nkeener-sighted retainer felt would not be for the good of the house, he\r\nhad either to disobey his lord, or act against his feeling of loyalty.\r\nDivided between the two duties, the samurai would usually do as he\r\nthought right for his country or his lord, disobeying his master's\r\norders; write a confession of his real motives; and save his name from\r\ndisgrace by committing suicide. By this act he would atone for his\r\ndisobedience, and his loyalty would never be questioned.\r\n\r\nThe now abolished custom of _hara-kiri_, or the voluntary taking of\r\none's life to avoid disgrace, and blot out entirely or partially the\r\nstain on an honorable name, is a curious custom which has come down from\r\nold times. The ancient heroes stabbed themselves as calmly as they did\r\ntheir enemies, and women as well as men knew how to use the short\r\nsword[37] worn always at the side of the samurai, his last and easy\r\nescape from shame.\r\n\r\n[37] The samurai always wore two swords, a long one for fighting only,\r\nand a short one for defense when possible, but, as a last resort, for\r\n_hara-kiri_. The sword is the emblem of the samurai spirit, and as such\r\nis respected and honored. A samurai took pride in keeping his swords as\r\nsharp and shining as was possible. He was never seen without the two\r\nswords, but the longer one he removed and left at the front door when he\r\nentered the house of a friend. To use a sword badly, to harm or injure\r\nit, or to step over it, was considered an insult to the owner.\r\n\r\nThe young men of this class, as well as their masters, the daimi[=o]s,\r\nwere early instructed in the method of this self-stabbing, so that it\r\nmight be cleanly and easily done, for a bloody and unseemly death would\r\nnot redound to the honor of the suicide. The fatal cut was not\r\ninstantaneous in its effect, and there was always opportunity for that\r\ndisplay of courage--that show of disregard for death or pain--which was\r\nexpected of the brave man.\r\n\r\nThe _hara-kiri_ was of course a last resort, but it was an honorable\r\ndeath. The vulgar criminal must be put to death by the hands of others,\r\nbut the nobler samurai, who never cares to survive disgrace, was\r\ncondemned to _hara-kiri_ if found guilty of actions worthy of death. Not\r\nto be allowed to do this, but to be executed in the common way, was a\r\ndouble disgrace to a samurai. Even to this day, when crimes such as the\r\nassassination of a minister of state are committed, in the mistaken\r\nbelief that the act is for the good of the country, the idea on the part\r\nof the assassin is never to escape detection. He calmly gives himself\r\nup to justice or takes his own life,[38] stating his motive for the\r\ndeed; and, believing himself justified in the act, is willing that his\r\nlife should be the cost.\r\n\r\n[38] Kurushima, who attempted to take the life of Okuma, the late\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, as recently as 1889, committed suicide\r\nimmediately after throwing the dynamite bomb which caused the minister\r\nthe loss of his leg. This was the more remarkable in that, at the time\r\nof his death, the assassin supposed that his victim had escaped all\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nThe old samurai was proud of his rank, his honorable vocation, his\r\nresponsibility; proud of his ignorance of trade and barter and of his\r\ndisregard for the sordid cares of the world, regarding as far beneath\r\nhim all occupations but those of arms. Wealth, as artisan or farmer,\r\nrarely tempted him to sink into the lower ranks; and his support from\r\nthe daimi[=o], often a mere pittance, insured to him more respect and\r\ngreater privileges than wealth as a héimin. To this day even, this\r\nfeeling exists. Preference for rank or position, rather than for mere\r\nsalary, remains strongly among the present generation, so that official\r\npositions are more sought after than the more lucrative occupations of\r\ntrade. Japan is flooded with small officials, and yet the samurai now\r\nis obliged to lay down his sword and devote his time to the once\r\ndespised trades, and to learn how important are the arts of peace\r\ncompared with those of war.\r\n\r\nThe dislike of anything suggestive of trade or barter--of services and\r\nactions springing, not from duty and from the heart, but from the desire\r\nof gain--has strongly tinted many little customs of the day, often\r\nmisunderstood and misconstrued by foreigners. In old Japan, experience\r\nand knowledge could not be bought and sold. Physicians did not charge\r\nfor their services, but on the contrary would decline to name or even\r\nreceive a compensation from those in their own clan. Patients, on their\r\nside, were too proud to accept services free, and would send to the\r\nphysicians, not as pay exactly, but more as a gift or a token of\r\ngratitude, a sum of money which varied according to the means of the\r\ngiver, as well as to the amount of service received. Daimi[=o]s did not\r\nsend to ask a teacher how much an hour his time was worth, and then\r\narrange the lessons accordingly; the teacher was not insulted by being\r\nexpected to barter his knowledge for so much filthy lucre, but was\r\nmerely asked whether his time and convenience would allow of his taking\r\nextra teaching. The request was made, not as a matter of give and take,\r\nbut a favor to be granted. Due compensation, however, would never fail\r\nto be made,--of this the teacher could be sure,--but no agreement was\r\never considered necessary.\r\n\r\nWith this feeling yet remaining in Japan,--this dislike of contracts,\r\nand exact charges for professional services,--we can imagine the inward\r\ndisgust of the samurai at the business-like habits of the foreigners\r\nwith whom he has to deal. On the other hand, his feelings are not\r\nappreciated by the foreigner, and his actions clash with the European\r\nand American ideas of independence and self-respect. In Japan a present\r\nof money is more honorable than pay, whereas in America pay is much more\r\nhonorable than a present.\r\n\r\nThe samurai of to-day is rapidly imbibing new ideas, and is learning to\r\nsee the world from a Western point of view; but his thoughts and actions\r\nare still moulded on the ideas of old Japan, and it will be a long time\r\nbefore the loyal, faithful, but proud spirit of the samurai will die\r\nout. The pride of clan is now changed to pride of race; loyalty to\r\nfeudal chief has become loyalty to the Emperor as sovereign; and the old\r\ntraits of character exist under the European costumes of to-day, as\r\nunder the flowing robes of the two-sworded retainer.\r\n\r\nIt is this same spirit of loyalty that has made it hard for Christianity\r\nto get a foothold in Japan. The Emperor was the representative of the\r\ngods of Japan. To embrace a new religion seemed a desertion of him, and\r\nthe following of the strange gods of the foreigner. The work of the\r\nCatholic missionaries which ended so disastrously in 1637 has left the\r\nimpression that a Christian is bound to offer allegiance to the Pope in\r\nmuch the same way as the Emperor now receives it from his people; and\r\nthe bitterness of such a thought has made many refuse to hear what\r\nChristianity really is. Such words as \"King\" and \"Lord\" they have\r\nunderstood as referring to temporal things, and it has taken years to\r\nundo this prejudice; a feeling in no way surprising when we consider\r\nhow the Jesuit missionaries once interfered with political movements in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nSo bitter was this feeling, when Japan was first opened, that a native\r\nChristian was at once branded as a traitor to his country, and very\r\nsevere was the persecution against all Christians. Missionaries at one\r\ntime dared not acknowledge themselves as such, and lived in danger of\r\ntheir lives; and the Japanese Christian who remained faithful did so\r\nknowing that he was despised and hated. I know of one mother who,\r\nfinding command and entreaty alike unavailing to move her son, a convert\r\nto the new religion, threatened to commit suicide, feeling that the\r\ndisgrace which had fallen on the family could only be wiped out with her\r\ndeath. Happily, all this is of the past, and to-day the samurai has\r\nfound that he can reconcile the new religion with his loyalty to Japan,\r\nand that in receiving the one he is not led to betray the other.\r\n\r\nThe women of the samurai have shared with the men the responsibilities\r\nof their rank, and the pride that comes from hereditary positions of\r\nresponsibility. A woman's first duty in all ranks of society is\r\nobedience; but sacrifice of self, in however horrible a way, was a duty\r\nmost cheerfully and willingly performed, when by such sacrifice father,\r\nhusband, or son might be the better able to fulfill his duty towards his\r\nfeudal superior. The women in the daimi[=o]s' castles who were taught\r\nfencing, drilled and uniformed, and relied upon to defend the castle in\r\ncase of need, were women of this class,--women whose husbands and\r\nfathers were soldiers, and in whose veins ran the blood of generations\r\nof fighting ancestors. Gentle, feminine, delicate as they were, there\r\nwas a possibility of martial prowess about them when the need for it\r\ncame; and the long education in obedience and loyalty did not fail to\r\nproduce the desired results. Death, and ignominy worse than death, could\r\nbe met bravely, but disgrace involving loss of honor to husband or\r\nfeudal lord was the one thing that must be avoided at all hazards. It\r\nwas my good fortune, many years ago, to make the acquaintance of a\r\nlittle Japanese girl who had lived in the midst of the siege of\r\nWakamatsu, the city in which the Sh[=o]gun's forces made their last stand\r\nfor their lord and the system that he represented. As the Emperor's\r\nforces marched upon the castle town, moat after moat was taken,[*209]\r\nuntil at last men, women, and children took refuge within the citadel\r\nitself to defend it until the last gasp. The bombs of the besiegers fell\r\ncrashing into the castle precincts, killing the women as they worked at\r\nwhatever they could do in aid of the defenders; and even the little\r\ngirls ran back and forth, amid the rain of bullets and balls, carrying\r\ncartridges, which the women were making within the castle, to the men\r\nwho were defending the walls. \"Weren't you afraid?\" we asked the\r\ndelicate child, when she told us of her own share in the defense. \"No,\"\r\nwas the answer. A small but dangerous sword, of the finest Japanese\r\nsteel, was shown us as the sword that she wore in her belt during all\r\nthose days of war and tumult. \"Why did you wear the sword?\" we asked.\r\n\"So that I would have it if I was taken prisoner.\" \"What would you have\r\ndone with it?\" was the next question, for we could not believe that a\r\nchild of eight would undertake to defend herself against armed soldiers\r\nwith that little sword. \"I would have killed myself,\" was the answer,\r\nwith a flash of the eye that showed her quite capable of committing the\r\nact in case of need.\r\n\r\nIn the olden times, when the spirit of warfare was strong and justice\r\nbut scantily administered, revenge for personal insult, or for the death\r\nof father or lord, fell upon the children, or the retainers. Sometimes\r\nthe bloody deed has fallen to the lot of a woman, to some weak and\r\nfeeble girl, who, in many a tale, has braved all the difficulties that\r\nbeset a woman's path, devoted her life to an act of vengeance, and, with\r\nthe courage of a man, has often successfully consummated her revenge.\r\n\r\nOne of the tales of old Japan, and a favorite subject of theatrical\r\nrepresentation, is the death and revenge of a lady in a daimi[=o]'s\r\npalace. Onoyé, a daughter of the people, child of a merchant, has by\r\nchance risen to the position of lady-in-waiting to a daimi[=o]'s\r\nwife,--a thing so uncommon that it has roused the jealousy of the other\r\nladies, who are of the samurai class. Iwafuji, one of the highest and\r\nproudest ladies at the court, takes pains on every occasion to insult\r\nand torment the poor, unoffending Onoyé, whom she cannot bear to have\r\nas an associate. She constantly reminds her of her inferior birth, and\r\nat last challenges her to a trial in fencing, in which accomplishment\r\nOnoyé is not proficient, having lacked the proper training in her early\r\nlife. At last the hatred and anger of Iwafuji culminate in a frenzy of\r\nrage; she forgets herself, and strikes the meek and gentle Onoyé with\r\nher sandal,--the worst insult that could be offered to any one.\r\n\r\nOnoyé, overcome by this deep disgrace offered her in public, returns\r\nfrom the main palace to her own apartments, and ponders long and deeply,\r\nin the bitterness of her soul, how to wipe out the disgrace of an insult\r\nby such an enemy.\r\n\r\nHer own faithful maid, seeing her disordered hair and anxious looks,\r\nperceives some secret trouble, which her mistress will not disclose, and\r\ntries, while performing her acts of service, to dispel the gloom by\r\ntelling gayly all the gossip of the day. This maid, O Haru, is a type of\r\nthe clever faithful servant. She is really of higher birth than her\r\nmistress, for, though she has been obliged to go out to service, she was\r\nborn of a samurai family. Onoyé, while listening to the talk of her\r\nservant, has made up her mind that only one thing can blot out her\r\ndisgrace, and that is to commit suicide. She hastily pens a farewell to\r\nher family, for the deed must not be delayed, and sends with the letter\r\nthe token of her disgrace,--Iwafuji's sandal, which she has kept. O Haru\r\nis sent on this errand, and, unconscious of the ill-news she is bearing,\r\nshe starts out. On the way, the ominous croak of the ravens, who are\r\nmaking a dismal noise,--a presage of ill-luck,--frightens the observant\r\nO Haru. A little further on, the strap of her clog breaks,--a still more\r\nalarming sign. Thoroughly frightened, O Haru turns back, and reaches her\r\nmistress' room in time to find that the fatal deed is done, and her\r\nmistress is dying. O Haru is heart-broken, learns the whole truth, and\r\nvows vengeance on the enemy of her loved mistress.\r\n\r\nO Haru, unlike Onoyé, is thoroughly trained in fencing. An occasion\r\narises when she returns to Iwafuji in public the malicious blow, and\r\nwith the same sandal, which she has kept as a sign of her revenge. She\r\nthen challenges Iwafuji, in behalf of the dead, to a trial in fencing.\r\nThe haughty Iwafuji is forced to accept, and is thoroughly defeated and\r\nshamed before the spectators. The whole truth is now made known, and the\r\ndaimi[=o], who admires and appreciates the spirit of O Haru, sends for\r\nher, and raises her from her low position to fill the post of her dead\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nThese stories show the spirit of the samurai women; they can suffer\r\ndeath bravely, even joyfully, at their own hands or the hands of husband\r\nor father, to avoid or wipe out any disgrace which they regard as a loss\r\nof honor; but they will as bravely and patiently subject themselves to a\r\nlife of shame and ignominy, worse than death, for the sake of gaining\r\nfor husband or father the means of carrying out a feudal obligation.\r\nThere is a pathetic scene, in one of the most famous of the Japanese\r\nhistorical dramas, in which one seems to get the moral perspective of\r\nthe ideal Japanese woman, as one cannot get it in any other way. The\r\nplay is founded on the story of \"The Loyal R[=o]nins,\" referred to in the\r\nbeginning of this chapter. The loyal r[=o]nins are plotting to avenge the\r\ndeath of their master upon the daimi[=o] whose cupidity and injustice have\r\nbrought it about. As there is danger of disloyalty even in their own\r\nranks, Oishi, the leader of the dead daimi[=o]'s retainers, displays great\r\ncaution in the selection of his fellow-conspirators, and practices every\r\nartifice to secure absolute secrecy for his plans. One young man, who\r\nwas in disgrace with his lord at the time of his death, applies to be\r\nadmitted within the circle of conspirators; but as it is suspected that\r\nhe may not be true to the cause, a payment in money is exacted from him\r\nas a pledge of his honorable intentions. It is thus made his first duty\r\nto redeem his honor from all suspicion by the payment of the money, in\r\norder that he may perform his feudal obligation of avenging the death of\r\nhis lord. But the young man is poor; he has married a poor girl, and has\r\nagreed to support not only his wife, but her old parents as well, and\r\nthe payment is impossible for him. In this emergency, his wife, at the\r\nsuggestion of her parents, proposes, as the only way, to sell herself,\r\nfor a term of two years, to the proprietor of a house of pleasure, that\r\nshe may by this vile servitude enable her husband to escape the\r\ndishonor that must come to him if he fails to fulfill his feudal duty.\r\nNegotiations are entered into, the contract is made, and an advance\r\npayment is given which will furnish money enough for the pledge required\r\nby the conspirators. All this is done without the knowledge of the\r\nhusband, lest his love for his wife and his grief for the sacrifice\r\nprevent him from accepting the only means left to prove his loyalty. The\r\nnoble wife even plans to leave her home while he is away on a hunting\r\nexpedition, and so spare him the pain of parting. His emotion upon\r\nlearning of this venture in business is not of wrath at the disgrace\r\nthat has overtaken his family, but simply of grief that his wife and her\r\nparents must make so great a sacrifice to save his honor. It is a\r\nterrible affliction, but it is not a disgrace in any way parallel to the\r\ndisgrace of disloyalty to his lord. And the heroic wife, when the men\r\ncome to carry her away, is upheld through all the trying farewells by\r\nthe consciousness that she is making as noble a sacrifice of herself as\r\ndid the wife of Yamato Daké when she leaped into the sea to avert the\r\nwrath of the sea-god from her husband. The Japanese, both men and\r\nwomen, knowing this story and many others similar in character, can see,\r\nas we cannot from our point of view, that, even if the body be defiled,\r\nthere is no defilement of the soul, for the woman is fulfilling her\r\nhighest duty in sacrificing all, even her dearest possession, for the\r\nhonor of her husband. It is a climax of self-abnegation that brings\r\nnothing but honor to the soul of her who reaches it. Japanese women who\r\nread this story feel profound pity for the poor wife, and a horror of a\r\nsacrifice that binds her to a life which outwardly, to the Japanese mind\r\neven, is the lowest depth a woman ever reaches. But they do not despise\r\nher for the act; nor would they refuse to receive her even were she to\r\nappear in living form to-day in any Japanese home, where, thanks to\r\nhappier fortunes, such sacrifices are not demanded. Just at this point\r\nis the difference of moral perspective that foreigners visiting Japan\r\nfind so hard to understand, and that leads many, who have lived in the\r\ncountry the longest, to believe that there is no modesty and purity\r\namong Japanese women. It is this that makes it possible for the vilest\r\nof stories, and those that have the least foundation in fact, to find\r\neasy belief among foreigners, even if they be told about the purest,\r\nmost high-minded, and most honorable of Japanese women. Our maidens, as\r\nthey grow to womanhood, are taught that anything is better than personal\r\ndishonor, and their maidenly instincts side with the teaching. With us,\r\na virtuous woman does not mean a brave, a heroic, an unselfish, or\r\nself-sacrificing woman, but means simply one who keeps herself from\r\npersonal dishonor. Chastity is the supreme virtue for a woman; all other\r\nvirtues are secondary compared with it. This is our point of view, and\r\nthe whole perspective is arranged with that virtue in the foreground.\r\nDismiss this for a moment, and consider the moral training of the\r\nJapanese maiden. From earliest youth until she reaches maturity, she is\r\nconstantly taught that obedience and loyalty are the supreme virtues,\r\nwhich must be preserved even at the sacrifice of all other and lesser\r\nvirtues. She is told that for the good of father or husband she must be\r\nwilling to meet any danger, endure any dishonor, perpetrate any crime,\r\ngive up any treasure. She must consider that nothing belonging solely\r\nto herself is of any importance compared with the good of her master,\r\nher family, or her country. Place this thought of obedience and loyalty,\r\nto the point of absolute self-abnegation, in the foreground, and your\r\nperspective is altered, the other virtues occupying places of varying\r\nimportance. Because a Japanese woman will sometimes sacrifice her\r\npersonal virtue for the sake of father or husband, does it follow that\r\nall Japanese women are unchaste and impure? In many cases this sacrifice\r\nis the noblest that she believes possible, and she goes to it, as she\r\nwould go to death in any dreadful form, for those whom she loves, and to\r\nwhom she owes the duty of obedience. The Japanese maiden grows to\r\nwomanhood no less pure and modest than our own girls, but our girls are\r\nnever called upon to sacrifice their modesty for the sake of those whom\r\nthey love best; nor is it expected of any woman in this country that she\r\nexist solely for the good of some one else, in whatever way he chooses\r\nto use her, during all the years of her life. Let us take this\r\ndifference into our thought in forming our judgment, and let us rather\r\nseek the causes that underlie the actions than pass judgment upon the\r\nactions themselves. From a close study of the characters of many\r\nJapanese women and girls, I am quite convinced that few women in any\r\ncountry do their duty, as they see it, more nobly, more single-mindedly,\r\nand more satisfactorily to those about them, than the women of Japan.\r\n\r\nMany argue that the purity of Japanese women, as compared with the men,\r\nthe ready obedience which they yield, their sweet characters and\r\nunselfish devotion as wives and mothers, are merely the results of the\r\nrestraint under which they live, and that they are too weak to be\r\nallowed to enjoy freedom of thought and action. Whether this be true or\r\nno is a point which we leave for others to take up, as time shall have\r\nprovided new data for reasoning on the subject.\r\n\r\nTo me, the sense of duty seems to be strongly developed in the Japanese\r\nwomen, especially in those of the samurai class. Conscience seems as\r\nactive, though often in a different manner, as the old-fashioned New\r\nEngland conscience, transmitted through the bluest of Puritan blood. And\r\nwhen a duty has once been recognized as such, no timidity, or\r\nmortification, or fear of ridicule will prevent the performance of it. A\r\ncase comes to my mind now of a young girl of sixteen, who made public\r\nconfession before her schoolmates of shortcomings of which none of them\r\nknew, for the sake of easing her troubled conscience and warning her\r\nschoolmates against similar errors. The circumstances were as follows:\r\nThe young girl had recently lost her grandmother, a most loving and\r\naffectionate old lady, who had taken the place of a mother to the child\r\nfrom her earliest infancy. In a somewhat unhappy home, the love of the\r\nold grandmother was the one bright spot; and when she was taken away,\r\nthe poor, lonely child's memory recalled all of her own shortcomings to\r\nthis beloved friend; and, too late to make amendment to the old lady\r\nherself, she dwelt on her own undutifulness, and decided that she must\r\nby some means do penance, or make atonement for her fault. She might, if\r\nshe made a confession before her schoolmates, warn them against similar\r\nmistakes; and accordingly she prepared, for the literary society in\r\nwhich the girls took what part they chose, a long confession, written\r\nin poetical style, and read it before her schoolmates and teachers. It\r\nwas a terrible ordeal, as one could see by the blushing face and\r\nbreaking voice, often choked with sobs; and when at the conclusion she\r\nurged her friends to behave in such a way to their dear ones that they\r\nneed never suffer what she had had to endure since her grandmother's\r\ndeath, there was not a dry eye in the room, and many of the girls were\r\nsobbing aloud. It was a curious expiation and a touching one, but one\r\nnot in the least exceptional or uncharacteristic of the spirit of duty\r\nthat actuates the best women of the samurai class.\r\n\r\nHere is another instance which illustrates this sense of duty, and\r\ndesire of atoning for past mistakes or sins. At the time of the\r\noverthrow of the feudal system, the samurai, bred to loyalty to their\r\nown feudal superiors as their highest duty, found themselves ranged on\r\ndifferent sides in the struggle, according to the positions in which\r\ntheir lords placed themselves. At the end of the struggle, those who had\r\nfollowed their daimi[=o]s to the field, in defense of the Sh[=o]gunate,\r\nfound that they had been fighting against the Emperor, the Son of\r\nHeaven himself, who had at last emerged from the seclusion of centuries\r\nto govern his own empire. Thus the supporters of the Sh[=o]gunate, while\r\nabsolutely loyal to their daimi[=o]s, had been disloyal to the higher\r\npower of the Emperor; and had put themselves in the position of traitors\r\nto their country. There was a conflict of principles there somewhat\r\nsimilar to that which took place in our Civil War, when, in the South,\r\nhe who was true to his State became a traitor to his country, and he who\r\nwas true to his country became a traitor to his State. Two ladies of the\r\nfinest samurai type had, with absolute loyalty to a lost cause, aided by\r\nevery means in their power in the defense of the city of Wakamatsu\r\nagainst the victorious forces of the Emperor. They had held on to the\r\nbitter end, and had been banished, with others of their family and clan,\r\nto a remote province, for some years after the end of the war. In 1877,\r\neleven years after the close of the War of the Restoration, a rebellion\r\nbroke out in the south which required a considerable expenditure of\r\nblood and money for its suppression. When the new war began, these two\r\nladies presented a petition to the government, in which they begged\r\nthat they might be allowed to make amends for their former position of\r\nopposition to the Emperor, by going with the army to the field as\r\nhospital nurses. At that time, no lady in Japan had ever gone to the\r\nfront to nurse the wounded soldiers; but to those two brave women was\r\ngranted the privilege of making atonement for past disloyalty, by the\r\nexercise of the skill and nerve that they had gained in their experience\r\nof war against the Emperor, in the nursing of soldiers wounded in his\r\ndefense.[*223]\r\n\r\nIn the old days, the women of the samurai class fulfilled most nobly the\r\nduties that fell to their lot. As wives and mothers in time of peace,\r\nthey performed their work faithfully in the quiet of their homes; and,\r\ntheir time filled with household cares, they busied themselves with the\r\nsmaller duties of life. As the wives and mothers of soldiers, they\r\ncultivated the heroic spirit befitting their position, fearing no danger\r\nsave such as involved disgrace. As the home-guard in time of need, they\r\nstood ready to defend their master's possessions with their own lives;\r\nas gentlewomen and ladies-in-waiting at the court of the daimi[=o] or the\r\nSh[=o]gun, they cultivated the arts and accomplishments required for their\r\nposition, and veiled the martial spirit that dwelt within them under an\r\nexterior as feminine, as gracious, as cultivated and charming, as that\r\nof any ladies of Europe or America. To-day in the new Japan, where the\r\nsamurai have no longer their yearly allowance from their lords and their\r\nfeudal duties, but, scattered through the whole nation, are engaged in\r\nall the arts and trades, and are infusing the old spirit into the new\r\nlife, what are the women doing? As the government of the land to-day\r\nlies in the hands of the samurai men under the Emperor, so the progress\r\nof the women, the new ideas of work for women, are in the hands of the\r\nsamurai women, led by the Empress. Wherever there is progress among the\r\nwomen, wherever they are looking about for new opportunities, entering\r\nnew occupations, elevating the home, opening hospitals, industrial\r\nschools, asylums, there you will find the leading spirits always of the\r\nsamurai class. In the recent changes, some of this class have risen\r\nabove their former state and joined the ranks of the nobility; and\r\nthere the presence of the samurai spirit infuses new life into the\r\naristocracy. So, too, the changes that have raised some have lowered\r\nothers, and the samurai is now to be found in the formerly despised\r\noccupations of trade and industry, among the merchants, the farmers, the\r\nfishermen, the artisans, and the domestic servants. But wherever his lot\r\nis cast, the old training, the old ideals, the old pride of family,\r\nstill keep him separate from his present rank, and, instead of pulling\r\nhim down to the level of those about him, tend to raise that level by\r\nthe example of honor and intelligence that he sets. The changed fortunes\r\nwere not met without a murmur. Most of the outrages, the reactionary\r\nmovements, the riots and inflammatory speeches and writings, that\r\ncharacterized the long period of disquiet following the Restoration,\r\ncame from men of this class, who saw their support taken from them,\r\nleaving them unable to dig and ashamed to beg. But the greater part of\r\nthem went sturdily to work, in government positions if they could get\r\nthem, in the army, on the police force, on the farm, in the shop, at\r\ntrades, at service,--even to the humble work of wheeling a\r\n_jinrikisha_, if other honest occupation could not be found; and the\r\nwomen shared patiently and bravely the changed fortunes of the men,\r\ndoing whatever they could toward bettering them. The samurai women\r\nto-day are eagerly working into the positions of teachers, interpreters,\r\ntrained nurses, and whatever other places there are which may be\r\nhonorably occupied by women. The girls' schools, both government and\r\nprivate, find many of their pupils among the samurai class; and their\r\ndeference and obedience to their teachers and superiors, their ambition\r\nand keen sense of honor in the school-room, show the influence of the\r\nsamurai feeling over new Japan. To the samurai women belongs the\r\ntask--and they have already begun to perform it--of establishing upon a\r\nbroader and surer foundation the position of women in their own country.\r\nThey, as the most intelligent, will be the first to perceive the remedy\r\nfor present evils, and will, if I mistake not, move heaven and earth, at\r\nsome time in the near future, to have that remedy applied to their own\r\ncase. Most of them read the literature of the day, some of them in at\r\nleast one language beside their own; a few have had the benefit of\r\ntravel abroad, and have seen what the home and the family are in\r\nChristian lands. There is as much of the unconquerable spirit of the\r\nsamurai to-day in the women as in the men; and it will not be very long\r\nbefore that spirit will begin to show itself in working for the\r\nestablishment of their homes and families upon some stronger basis than\r\nthe will of the husband and father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPEASANT WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great héimin class includes not only the peasants of Japan, but also\r\nthe artisans and merchants; artisans ranking below farmers, and\r\nmerchants below artisans, in the social structure. It includes the whole\r\nof the common people, except such as were in former times altogether\r\nbelow the level of respectability, the _éta_ and _hinin_,[39]--outcasts\r\nwho lived by begging, slaughtering animals, caring for dead bodies,\r\ntanning skins, and other employments which rendered them unclean\r\naccording to the old notions. From very early times the agricultural\r\nclass has been sharply divided from the samurai or military. Here and\r\nthere one from the peasantry mounts by force of his personal qualities\r\ninto the higher ranks, for there is no caste system that prevents the\r\npassing from one class into another,--only a class prejudice that serves\r\nvery nearly the same purpose, in keeping samurai and héimin in their\r\nplaces, that the race prejudice in this country serves in confining the\r\nnegroes, North and South, to certain positions and occupations. The\r\nfirst division of the military from the peasantry occurred in the eighth\r\ncentury, and since then the peculiar circumstances of each class have\r\ntended to produce quite different characteristics in persons originally\r\nof the same stock. To the soldier class have fallen learning, skill in\r\narms and horsemanship, opportunities to rise to places of honor and\r\npower, lives free from sordid care in regard to the daily rice, and in\r\nwhich noble ideas of duty and loyalty can spring up and bear fruit in\r\nheroic deeds. To the peasant, tilling his little rice-field year after\r\nyear, have come the heavy burdens of taxation; the grinding toil for a\r\nmere pittance of food for himself and his family; the patient bearing of\r\nall things imposed by his superiors, with little hope of gain for\r\nhimself, whatever change the fortunes of war may bring to those above\r\nhim in the social scale. Is there wonder that, as the years have gone\r\nby, his wits have grown heavy under his daily drudgery; that he knows\r\nlittle and understands less of the changes that are taking place in his\r\nnative land; that he is easily moved by only one thing, and that the\r\nfailure of his crops, or the shortening of his returns from his land by\r\nheavier taxation? This is true of the héimin as a class: they are\r\nconservative, fearing that change will but tend to make harder a lot\r\nthat is none too easy; and though peaceable and gentle usually, they may\r\nbe moved to blind acts of riot and bloodshed by any political change\r\nthat seems likely to produce heavier taxation, or even by a failure of\r\ntheir crops, when they see themselves and their families starving while\r\nthe military and official classes have enough and to spare. But though,\r\nas a class, the farmers are ignorant and heavy, they are seldom entirely\r\nilliterate; and everywhere, throughout the country, one finds men\r\nbelonging to this class who are well educated and have risen to\r\npositions of much responsibility and power, and are able to hold their\r\nown, and think for themselves and for their brethren. From an article in\r\nthe \"T[=o]ky[=o] Mail,\" entitled \"A Memorialist of the Latter Days of the\r\nTokugawa Government,\" I quote passages which show the thoughts of one of\r\nthe héimin upon the condition of his own class about the year 1850. It\r\nis from a petition sent to the Sh[=o]gun by the head-man of the village of\r\nOgushi.\r\n\r\n[39] The laws against the _éta_ and _hinin_, making of them a distinct,\r\nunclean class, and forbidding their intermarriage with any of the higher\r\nclasses, have recently been abolished. There is now no rank distinction\r\nof any practical value, except that between noble and common people.\r\nHéimin and samurai are now indiscriminately mingled.\r\n\r\nThe first point in the petition is, that there is a growing tendency to\r\nluxury among the military and official classes. \"It is useless to issue\r\norders commanding peasants and others to be frugal and industrious, when\r\nthose in power, whose duty it is to show a good example to the people,\r\nare themselves steeped in luxury and idleness.\" He ventures to reproach\r\nthe Sh[=o]guns themselves by pointing to the extravagance with which they\r\nhave decorated the mausoleums at Nikk[=o] and elsewhere. \"Is this,\" he\r\nasks, \"in keeping with the intentions of the glorious founder of your\r\ndynasty? Look at the shrines in Isé and elsewhere, and at the sepulchres\r\nof the Emperors of successive ages. Is gold or silver used in decorating\r\nthem?\" He then turns to the vassals of the Sh[=o]gun, and charges them\r\nwith being tyrannical, rapacious, and low-minded. \"Samurai,\" he\r\ncontinues,--\"samurai are finely attired, but how contemptible they look\r\nin the eyes of those peasants who know how to be contented with what\r\nthey have!\"\r\n\r\nFurther on in the same memorial, he points out what he regards as a\r\ngrave mistake in the policy of the Sh[=o]gun. A decree had just been\r\nissued prohibiting the peasantry from exercising themselves with\r\nsword-play, and from wearing swords. Of this he says: \"Perhaps this\r\ndecree may have been issued on the supposition that Japan is naturally\r\nimpregnable and defended on all sides. But when she receives insult from\r\na foreign country, it may become necessary to call on the militia. And\r\nwho knows that men of extraordinary military genius, like Toyotomi,[40]\r\nwill not again appear among the lower classes?\"\r\n\r\n[40] Toyotomi Hidéyoshi, a peasant boy, rose from the position of a\r\ngroom to be the actual ruler of Japan during the Middle Ages. He it was\r\nwho in 1587 issued a decree of banishment against the Christian\r\nmissionaries in Japan. He is called Faxiba in the writings of these\r\nmissionaries, and in Japan he is frequently spoken of as Taiko Sama, a\r\ntitle, not a name; but a title that, used alone, refers always to him.\r\nFor further account of his life, see Griffis, _Mikado's Empire_, book\r\ni., chap. xxiv.\r\n\r\nHe ends his memorial with this warning: \"Should the Sh[=o]gun's court, and\r\nthe military class in general, persist in the present oppressive way of\r\ngovernment, Heaven will visit this land with still greater calamities.\r\nIf this circumstance is not clearly kept in view, the consequence may be\r\ncivil disturbance. I, therefore, beseech that the instructions of the\r\nglorious founder of the dynasty be acted upon; that simplicity and\r\nfrugality be made the guiding principle of administration; and that a\r\ngeneral amnesty be proclaimed, thereby complying with the will of Heaven\r\nand placating the people. Should these humble suggestions of mine be\r\nacted upon, prospective calamities will fly before the light of virtue.\r\nWhether the country is to be safe or not depends upon whether the\r\nadministration is carried on with mercy or not. What I pray for is, that\r\nthe country may enjoy peace and tranquillity, that the harvest may be\r\nplentiful, and that the people may be happy and prosperous.\"\r\n\r\nOne is able to see, by this rather remarkable document, that the\r\npeasants of Japan, though frequently almost crushed by the heavy burdens\r\nof taxation, do not, even in the most grinding poverty, lose entirely\r\nthat independence of thought and of action which is characteristic of\r\ntheir nation. They do not consider themselves as a servile class, nor\r\ntheir military rulers as beyond criticism or reproach, but are ready to\r\nspeak boldly for their rights whenever an opportunity occurs. There is a\r\npathetic story, told in Mitford's \"Tales of Old Japan,\" of a peasant,\r\nthe head-man of his village, who goes to Yedo to present to the\r\nSh[=o]gun a complaint, on behalf of his fellow-villagers, of the\r\nextortions and exactions of his daimi[=o]. He is unable to get any one\r\nto present his memorial to the Sh[=o]gun, so at last he stops the great\r\nlord's palanquin in the street,--an act in itself punishable with\r\ndeath,--and thrusts the paper forcibly into his hand. The petition is\r\nread, and his fellow-villagers saved from further oppression, but the\r\nhead-man, for his daring, is condemned by his own daimi[=o] to suffer\r\ndeath by crucifixion,--a fate which he meets with the same heroism with\r\nwhich he dared everything to save his fellows from suffering.\r\n\r\nThe peasant, though ignorant and oppressed, has not lost his manhood;\r\nhas not become a slave or a serf, but clings to his rights, so far as\r\nhe knows what they are; and is ready to hold his own against all comers,\r\nwhen the question in debate is one that appeals to his mind. The rulers\r\nof Japan have always the peasantry to reckon with when their ruling\r\nbecomes unjust or oppressive. They cannot be cowed, though they may be\r\nmisled for a time, and they form a conservative element that serves to\r\nhold in check too hasty rulers who would introduce new measures too\r\nquickly, and would be likely to find the new wine bursting the old\r\nbottles, as well as to prevent any rash extravagance in the way of\r\npersonal expenditure on the part of government officials. The influence\r\nof this great class will be more and more felt as the new parliamentary\r\ninstitutions gain in power, and a more close connection is established\r\nbetween the throne and public opinion.\r\n\r\nIn considering this great héimin class, it is well to remember that the\r\nartisans, who form so large a part of it, are also the artists who have\r\nmade the reputation of Japan, in Europe and America, as one of the\r\ncountries where art and the love of beauty in form and color are still\r\ninstinct with life. The Japanese artisan works with patient toil, and\r\nwith the skill and originality of the artist, to produce something that\r\nshall be individual and his own; not simply to make, after a pattern,\r\nsome utensil or ornament for which he cares nothing, so long as a\r\npurchaser can be found for it, or an employer can be induced to pay him\r\nmoney for making it. It seems as easy for the Japanese to make things\r\npretty and in good taste, even when they are cheap and only used by the\r\npoorer people, as it is for American mills and workers to turn out\r\nendless varieties of attempts at decoration,--all so hideous that a poor\r\nperson must be content, either to be surrounded by the worst possible\r\ntaste, or to purchase only such furnishings and utensils as are entirely\r\nwithout decoration of any kind. \"Cheap\" and \"nasty\" have come to be\r\nalmost synonymous words with us, for the reason that taste in decoration\r\nis so rare that it commands a monopoly price, and can only be procured\r\nby the wealthy. In Japan this is not the case, for the cheapest of\r\nthings may be found in graceful and artistic designs,--indeed can\r\nhardly be found in any designs that are not graceful and artistic; and\r\nthe poorest and commonest of the people may have about them the little\r\nthings that go to cultivate the æsthetic part of human nature. It was\r\nnot the costly art of Japan that interested me the most, although that\r\nis, of course, the most wonderful proof of the capacity and patience of\r\nindividuals among this héimin class: but it was the common, cheap,\r\nevery-day art that meets one at every turn; the love for the beautiful,\r\nin both nature and art, that belongs to the common coolie as well as to\r\nthe nobleman. The cheap prints, the blue and white towels, the common\r\nteacups and pots, the great iron kettles in use over the fire in the\r\nfarmhouse kitchen,--all these are things as pretty and tasteful in their\r\nway as the rich crêpes, the silver incense burners, the delicate\r\nporcelain, and the elegant lacquer that fill the storehouse of the\r\ndaimi[=o]; and they show, much more conclusively than these costlier\r\nthings, the universal sense of beauty among the people.\r\n\r\nThe artisan works at his home, helped less often by hired laborers than\r\nby his own children, who learn the trade of their father; and his\r\nhouse, though small, is clean and tasteful, with its soft mats, its\r\ndainty tea service, its little hanging scroll upon the walls, and its\r\nvase of gracefully arranged flowers in the corner; for flowers, even in\r\nwinter and in the great city of T[=o]ky[=o], are so cheap that they are\r\nnever beyond the reach of the poorest. In homes that seem to the foreign\r\nmind utterly lacking in the comforts and even the necessities of life,\r\none finds the few furnishings and utensils beautiful in shape and\r\ndecoration; and the money that in this country must be spent in beds,\r\ntables, and chairs can be used for the purchase of _kakémonos_, flowers,\r\nand vases, and for various gratifications of the æsthetic taste. Hence\r\nit is that the Japanese laborer, who lives on a daily wage which would\r\nreduce an American or European to the verge of starvation, finds both\r\ntime and money for the cultivation of that sense of beauty which is too\r\noften crushed completely out of the lower classes by the burdens of this\r\nnineteenth century civilization which they bear upon their shoulders. To\r\nthe Japanese, the \"life is more than meat,\" it is beauty as well; and\r\nthis love of beauty has upon him a civilizing and refining effect, and\r\nmakes him in many ways the superior of the American day-laborer.[*239]\r\n\r\nThe peasants and farmers of Japan, thrifty and hard-working as they are,\r\nare not by any means a prosperous class. As one passes into the country\r\ndistricts from the large cities, there seems to be a conspicuous dearth\r\nof neat, pleasant homes,--a lack of the comforts and necessities of life\r\nsuch as are enjoyed by city people. The rich farmers are scarce, and the\r\nlaborers in the rice-fields hardly earn, from days of hardest toil with\r\nthe rudest implements, the little that will provide for their families.\r\nIn the face of heavy taxes, the incessant toil, the frequent floods of\r\nlate years, and the threatening famine, one would expect the poor\r\npeasants to be a most discouraged and unhappy class. That all this toil\r\nand anxiety does wear on them is no doubt true, but the laborers are\r\nalways ready to bear submissively whatever comes, and are always hopeful\r\nand prepared to enjoy life again in happier times. The charms of the\r\ncity tempt them sometimes to exchange their daily labor for the\r\nexcitement of life as _jinrikisha_ men; but in any case they will be\r\nperfectly independent, and ask no man for their daily rations.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is much poverty, there are few or no beggars in Japan,\r\nfor both strong and weak find each some occupation that brings the\r\nlittle pittance required to keep soul and body together, and gives to\r\nall enough to make them light-hearted, cheerful, and even happy. From\r\nthe rich farmer, whose many acres yield enough to provide for a home of\r\nluxury quite as fine as the city homes, to the poor little vender of\r\nsticks of candy, around whose store the children flock like bees with\r\ntheir rin and sen, all seem independent, contented, and satisfied with\r\ntheir lot in life.\r\n\r\nThe religious beliefs of old Japan are stronger to-day among the country\r\npeople than among the dwellers in cities. And they are still willing to\r\ngive of their substance for the aid of the dying faiths to which they\r\ncling, and to undertake toilsome pilgrimages to obtain some longed-for\r\nblessing from the gods whom they serve. A great Buddhist temple is being\r\nbuilt in Ky[=o]t[=o] to-day, from the lofty ceiling of which hangs a\r\nstriking proof of the devotion of some of the peasant women to the\r\nBuddhist faith. The whole temple, with its immense curved roof, its vast\r\nproportions, and its marvelous wood carvings, has been built by\r\nofferings of labor, money, and materials made by the faithful. The great\r\ntimbers were given and brought to the spot by the countrymen; and the\r\nwomen, wishing to have some part in the sacred work, cut off their\r\nabundant hair, a beauty perhaps more prized by the Japanese women than\r\nby those of other countries, and from the material thus obtained they\r\ntwisted immense cables, to be used in drawing the timbers from the\r\nmountains to the site of the temple. The great black cables hang in the\r\nunfinished temple to-day, a sign of the devotion of the women who spared\r\nnot their chief ornament in the service of the gods in whom they still\r\nbelieve. And a close scrutiny of these touching offerings shows that the\r\nglossy black locks of the young women are mingled with the white hairs\r\nof those who, by this sacrifice, hope to make sure of a quick and easy\r\ndeparture from a life already near its close.\r\n\r\nAll along the T[=o]kaid[=o], the great road from T[=o]ky[=o] to\r\nKy[=o]to, in the neighborhood of some holy place, or in the district\r\naround the great and sacred Fuji, the mountain so much beloved and\r\nhonored in Japanese art, will be seen bands of pilgrims slowly walking\r\nalong the road, their worn and soiled white garments telling of many\r\ndays' weary march. Their large hats shield them from the sun and the\r\nrain, and the pieces of matting slung over their backs serve them for\r\nbeds to sleep on, when they take shelter for the night in rude huts. The\r\nway up the great mountain of Fuji is lined with these pilgrims; for to\r\nattain its summit, and worship there the rising sun, is believed to be\r\nthe means of obtaining some special blessing. Among these religious\r\ndevotees, in costumes not unlike those of the men, under the same large\r\nhat and coarse matting, old women often are seen, their aged faces\r\nbelying their apparent vigor of body, as they walk along through miles\r\nand miles of country, jingling their bells and holding their rosaries\r\nuntil they reach the shrine, where they may ask some special blessing\r\nfor their homes, or fulfill some vow already made.[*242]\r\n\r\nJourneying through rural Japan, one is impressed by the important part\r\nplayed by women in the various bread-winning industries. In the village\r\nhomes, under the heavily thatched roofs, the constant struggle against\r\npoverty and famine will not permit the women to hold back, but they\r\nenter bravely into all the work of the men. In the rice-field the woman\r\nworks side by side with the man, standing all day up to her knees in\r\nmud, her dress tucked up and her lower limbs encased in tight-fitting,\r\nblue cotton trousers, planting, transplanting, weeding, and turning over\r\nthe evil-smelling mire, only to be distinguished from her husband by her\r\nbroader belt tied in a bow behind. In mountain regions we meet the women\r\nclimbing the steep mountain roads, pruning-hook in hand, after wood for\r\nwinter fires; or descending, towards night, carrying a load that a\r\ndonkey need not be ashamed of, packed on a frame attached to the\r\nshoulders, or poised lightly upon a straw mat upon the head. There is\r\none village near Ky[=o]to, Yasé by name, at the base of Hiyéi Zan, the\r\nhistoric Buddhist stronghold, where the women attain a stature and\r\nmuscular development quite unique among the pigmy population of the\r\nisland empire. Strong, jolly, red-cheeked women they are, showing no\r\nevidence of the shrinking away with the advance of old age that is\r\ncharacteristic of most of their countrywomen. With their tucked-up\r\n_kimonos_ and blue cotton trousers, they stride up and down the\r\nmountain, carrying the heaviest and most unwieldy of burdens as lightly\r\nand easily as the ordinary woman carries her baby. My first acquaintance\r\nwith them was during a camping expedition upon the sacred mountain. I\r\nmyself was carried up the ascent by two small, nearly naked, finely\r\ntattooed and moxa-scarred men; but my baggage, consisting of two closely\r\npacked hampers as large as ordinary steamer trunks, was lifted lightly\r\nto the heads of these feminine porters, and, poised on little straw\r\npads, carried easily up the narrow trail, made doubly difficult by\r\nlow-hanging branches, to the camp, a distance of three or four miles.\r\nFrom among these women of Yasé, on account of their remarkable physical\r\ndevelopment, have been chosen frequently the nurses for the imperial\r\ninfants; an honor which the Yasé villagers duly appreciate, and which\r\nmakes them bear themselves proudly among their less favored neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the country, in the neighborhood of Nikk[=o], for\r\ninstance, the care of the horses, mild little pack-mares that do much of\r\nthe burden-bearing in those mountains, is mainly in the hands of the\r\nwomen. At Nikk[=o], when we would hire ponies for a two days' expedition\r\nto Yumoto, a little, elderly woman was the person with whom our bargains\r\nwere made; and a close bargainer she proved to be, taking every\r\nadvantage that lay in her power. When the caravan was ready to start, we\r\nfound that, though each saddle-horse had a male groom in attendance, the\r\npack-ponies on which our baggage was carried were led by pretty little\r\ncountry girls of twelve or fourteen, their bright black eyes and red\r\ncheeks contrasting pleasantly with the blue handkerchiefs that adorned\r\ntheir heads; their slender limbs encased in blue cotton, and only their\r\nred sashes giving any hint of the fact that they belonged to the weaker\r\nsex. As we journeyed up the rough mountain roads, the little girls kept\r\nalong easily with the rest of the party; leading their meek,\r\nshock-headed beasts up the slippery log steps, and passing an occasional\r\ngreeting with some returning pack-train, in which the soft black eyes\r\nand bits of red about the costume of the little grooms showed that they,\r\ntoo, were mountain maidens, returning fresh and happy after a two days'\r\ntramp through the rocky passes.\r\n\r\nIn the districts where the silkworm is raised, and the silk spun and\r\nwoven, the women play a most important part in this productive industry.\r\nThe care of the worms and of the cocoons falls entirely upon the women,\r\nas well as the spinning of the silk and the weaving of the cloth. It is\r\nalmost safe to say that this largest and most productive industry of\r\nJapan is in the hands of the women; and it is to their care and skill\r\nthat the silk product of the islands is due. In the silk districts one\r\nfinds the woman on terms of equality with the man, for she is an\r\nimportant factor in the wealth-producing power of the family, and is\r\nthus able to make herself felt as she cannot when her work is inferior\r\nto that of the men. As a farmer, as a groom, or as a porter, a woman is\r\nand must remain an inferior, but in the care of the silkworms, and all\r\nthe tasks that belong to silk culture, she is the equal of the stronger\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nThen, again, in the tea districts, the tea plantations are filled with\r\nyoung girls and old women, their long sleeves held back by a band over\r\nthe shoulder, and a blue towel gracefully fastened over their heads to\r\nkeep off the sun and the dust. They pick busily away at the green,\r\ntender leaves, which will soon be heated and rolled by strong men over\r\nthe charcoal fire. The occupation is an easy one, only requiring care in\r\nthe selection of leaves to be picked, and can be performed by young\r\ngirls and old women, who gather the glossy leaves in their big baskets,\r\nwhile chatting to each other over the gossip and news of the day.\r\n\r\nIn the hotels, both in the country and the city, women play an important\r\npart. The attendants are usually sweet-faced, prettily dressed girls,\r\nand frequently the proprietor of the hotel is a woman. My first\r\nexperience of a Japanese hotel was at Nara, anciently the capital of\r\nJapan, and now a place of resort because of its fine old temples, its\r\nDai Butsu, and its beautiful deer park. The day's ride in _jinrikisha_\r\nfrom [=O]saka had brought our party in very tired, only to find that the\r\nhotel to which we had telegraphed for rooms was already filled to\r\noverflowing by a daimi[=o] and his suite. Not a room could be obtained,\r\nand we were at last obliged to walk some distance, for we had dismissed\r\nour tired _jinrikisha_ men, to a hotel in the village, of which we knew\r\nnothing. What with fatigue and disappointment, we were not prepared to\r\nview the unknown hotel in a very rosy light; and when our guide pointed\r\nto a small gate leading into a minute, damp courtyard, we were quite\r\nconvinced that the hardships of travel in Japan were now about to begin;\r\nbut disappointment gave way to hope, when we were met at the door by a\r\nbuxom landlady, whose smile was in itself a refreshment. Although we had\r\nlittle in the way of language in common, she made us feel at home at\r\nonce, took us to her best room, sent her blooming and prettily dressed\r\ndaughters to bring us tea and whatever other refreshments the mysterious\r\nappetite of a foreigner might require, and altogether behaved toward us\r\nin such motherly fashion that fatigue and gloom departed forthwith,\r\nleaving us refreshed and cheerful. Soon we began to feel rested, and our\r\nkind friend, seeing this, took us upon a tour around the house, in\r\nwhich room after room, spotless, empty, with shining woodwork and\r\nsoftest of mats, showed the good housekeeping of our hostess. A little\r\ngarden in the centre of the house, with dwarf trees, moss-covered\r\nstones, and running water, gave it an air of coolness on the hot July\r\nday that was almost deceptive; and the spotless wash-room, with its\r\ngreat stone sink, its polished brass basins, its stone well-curb, half\r\nin and half out of the house, was cool and clean and refreshing merely\r\nto look at. A two days' stay in this hotel showed that the landlady was\r\nthe master of the house. Her husband was about the house constantly, as\r\nwere one or two other men, but they all worked under the direction of\r\nthe energetic head of affairs. She it was who managed everything, from\r\nthe cooking of the meals in the kitchen to the filling and heating of\r\nthe great bath-tub into which the guests were invited to enter every\r\nafternoon, one after the other, in the order of their rank. On the\r\nsecond night of my stay, at a late hour, when I supposed that the whole\r\nhouse had retired to rest, I crept softly out of my room to try to\r\nsoothe the plaintive wails of my dog, who was complaining bitterly that\r\nhe was made to sleep in the wood-cellar instead of in his mistress's\r\nroom, as his habit had always been. As I stole quietly along, fearing\r\nlest I should arouse the sleeping house, I heard the inquiring voice of\r\nmy landlady sound from the bath-room, the door of which stood wide open.\r\nAfraid that she would think me in mischief if I did not show myself, I\r\nwent to the door, to find her, after her family was safely stowed away\r\nfor the night, taking her ease in the great tub of hot water, and so\r\npreparing herself for a sound, if short, night's sleep. She accepted my\r\nmurmured _Inu_ (dog) as an excuse, and graciously dismissed me with a\r\nsmile, and I returned to my room feeling safe under the vigilant care\r\nthat seemed to guard the house by night as well as by day. I have seen\r\nmany Japanese hotels and many careful landladies since, but no one among\r\nthem all has made such an impression as my pleasant hostess at Nara.\r\n\r\nNot only hotels, but little tea-houses all through Japan, form openings\r\nfor the business abilities of women, both in country and city. Wherever\r\nyou go, no matter how remote the district or how rough the road, at\r\nevery halting point you find a tea-house. Sometimes it is quite an\r\nextensive restaurant, with several rooms for the entertainment of\r\nguests, and a regular kitchen where fairly elaborate cooking can be\r\ndone; sometimes it is only a rough shelter, at one end of which water is\r\nkept boiling over a charcoal brazier, while at the other end a couple of\r\nseats, covered with mats or a scarlet blanket or two, serve as\r\nresting-places for the patrons of the establishment. But whatever the\r\nplace is, there will be one woman or more in attendance; and if you sit\r\ndown upon the mats, you will be served at once with tea, and later,\r\nshould you require more, with whatever the establishment can afford,--it\r\nmay be only a slice of watermelon, or a hard pear; it may be eels on\r\nrice, vermicelli, egg soup, or a regular dinner, should the tea-house be\r\none of the larger and more elaborately appointed ones. When the feast is\r\nover, the refreshments you have especially ordered are paid for in the\r\nregular way; but for the tea and sweetmeats offered, for which no\r\nespecial charge is made, you are expected to leave a small sum as a\r\npresent. In the less aristocratic resting-places, a few cents for each\r\nperson is sufficient to leave on the waiter with the empty cups of tea,\r\nfor which loud and grateful thanks will be shouted out to the retiring\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIn the regular inn, the _chadai_[41] amounts to several dollars, for a\r\nparty remaining any time, and it is supposed to pay for all the extra\r\nservices and attention bestowed on guests by the polite host and hostess\r\nand the servants in attendance. The _chadai_, done up neatly in paper,\r\nwith the words _On chadai_ written on it, is given with as much\r\nformality as any present in Japan. The guest claps his hands to summon\r\nthe maid. When it is heard, for the thin paper walls of a Japanese house\r\nlet through every noise, voices from all sides will shout out\r\n_H[=e]´-h[=e]´_, or _Hai_, which means that you have been heard, and\r\nunderstood. Presently a maid will softly open your door, and with head\r\nlow down will ask what you wish. You tell her to summon the landlord.\r\nIn a few moments he appears, and you push the _chadai_ to him, making\r\nsome conventional self-depreciating speech, as, \"You have done a great\r\ndeal for our comfort, and we wish to give you this _chadai_, though it\r\nis only a trifle.\" The landlord, with every expression of surprise, will\r\nbow down to the ground with thanks, raising the small package to his\r\nhead in token of acceptance and gratitude, and will murmur in low tones\r\nhow little he has done for the comfort of his guests; and then, the\r\nself-depreciation and formal words of thanks on his side being ended, he\r\nwill finally go down stairs to see how much he has gotten. But, whether\r\nmore or less than he had expected, nothing but extreme gratitude and\r\npoliteness appears on his face as he presents a fan, confectionery, or\r\nsome trifle, as a return for the _chadai_, and speeds the parting guests\r\nwith his lowest bow and kindliest smile, after having seen to every want\r\nthat could be attended to.\r\n\r\n[41] _Chadai_ is, literally, \"money for tea,\" and is equivalent to our\r\ntips to the waiters and porters at hotels. The _chadai_ varies with the\r\nwealth and rank of the guests, the duration of the stay, and the\r\nattention which has been bestowed. _On_ is the honorific placed before\r\nthe word in writing.\r\n\r\nOnce, at Nikk[=o], I started with a friend for a morning walk to a place\r\ndescribed in the guide-book. The day was hot and the guide-book hazy,\r\nand we lost the road to the place for which we had set out, but found\r\nourselves at last in a beautiful garden, with a pretty lake in its\r\ncentre, a little red-lacquered shrine reflected in the lake, and a\r\ntea-house hospitably open at one side. The teakettle was boiling over\r\nthe little charcoal fire; melons, eggs, and various unknown comestibles\r\nwere on the little counter; but no voice bade us welcome as we\r\napproached, and when we sat down on the edge of the piazza, we could see\r\nno one within the house. We waited, however, for the day was hot, and\r\ntime is not worth much in rural Japan. Pretty soon a small, wizened\r\nfigure made its appearance in the distance, hurrying and talking\r\nexcitedly as it came near enough to see two foreign ladies seated upon\r\nthe piazza. Many bows and profuse apologies were made by the little old\r\nwoman, who seemed to be the solitary occupant of the pretty garden, and\r\nwho had for the moment deserted her post to do the day's marketing in\r\nthe neighboring village. The apologies having been smilingly received,\r\nthe old lady set herself to the task of making her guests comfortable.\r\nFirst she brought two tumblers of water, cold as ice, from the spring\r\nthat gushed out of a great rock in the middle of the little lake. Then\r\nshe retired behind a screen and changed her dress, returning speedily to\r\nbring us tea. Then she retreated to her diminutive kitchen, and\r\npresently came back smiling, bearing eight large raw potatoes on a tray.\r\nThese she presented to us with a deep bow, apparently satisfied that she\r\nhad at last brought us something we would be sure to like. We left the\r\npotatoes behind us when we went away, and undoubtedly the old lady is\r\nwondering still over the mysterious ways of the foreigners, as we are\r\nover those of the Japanese tea-house keepers.\r\n\r\nOne summer, when I was spending a week at a Japanese hotel at quite a\r\nfashionable seaside resort, I became interested in a little old woman\r\nwho visited the hotel daily, carrying, suspended by a yoke from her\r\nshoulders, two baskets of fruit, which she sold to the guests of the\r\nhotel. As I was on the ground floor, and my room was, in the daytime,\r\nabsolutely without walls on two sides, she was my frequent visitor, and,\r\nfor the sake of her pleasant ways and cheerful smiles, I bought enough\r\nhard pears of her to have given the colic to an elephant. One day,\r\nafter her visit to me, as I was sitting upon the matted and roofed\r\nsquare that served me for a room, my eye wandered idly toward the\r\nbathing beach, and, under the slight shelter where the bathers were in\r\nthe habit of depositing their sandals and towels, I spied the well-known\r\nyoke and fruit baskets, as well as a small heap of blue cotton garments\r\nthat I knew to be the clothing of the little fruit-vender. She had\r\nevidently taken a moment when trade was slack to enjoy a dip in the\r\nsoft, blue, summer sea. Hardly had I made up my mind as to the meaning\r\nof the fruit baskets and the clothing, when our little friend herself\r\nemerged from the sea and, sitting down on a bench, proceeded to rub\r\nherself off with the small but artistically decorated blue towel that\r\nevery peasant in Japan has always with him, however lacking he may be in\r\nall other appurtenances of the toilet. As she sat there, placidly\r\nrubbing away, a friend of the opposite sex made his appearance on the\r\nscene. I watched to see what she would do, for the Japanese code of\r\netiquette is quite different from ours in such a predicament. She\r\ncontinued her employment until he was quite close, showing no unseemly\r\nhaste, but continuing her polishing off in the same leisurely manner in\r\nwhich she had begun it; then at the proper moment she rose from her\r\nseat, bowed profoundly, and smilingly exchanged the greetings proper for\r\nthe occasion, both parties apparently unconscious of any lack in the\r\ntoilet of the lady. The male friend then passed on about his business;\r\nthe little woman completed her toilet without further interruptions,\r\nshouldered her yoke, and jogged cheerfully on to her home in the little\r\nvillage, a couple of miles away.\r\n\r\nAs one travels through rural Japan in summer and sees the half-naked\r\nmen, women, and children that pour out from every village on one's route\r\nand surround the _kuruma_ at every stopping place, one sometimes wonders\r\nwhether there is in the country any real civilization, whether these\r\nhalf-naked people are not more savage than civilized; but when one finds\r\neverywhere good hotels, scrupulous cleanliness in all the appointments\r\nof toilet and table, polite and careful service, honest and willing\r\nperformance of labor bargained for, together with the gentlest and\r\npleasantest of manners, even on the part of the gaping crowd that shut\r\nout light and air from the traveling foreigner who rests for a moment at\r\nthe village inn, one is forced to reconsider a judgment formed only upon\r\none peculiarity of the national life, and to conclude that there is\r\ncertainly a high type of civilization in Japan, though differing in many\r\nimportant particulars from our own. A careful study of the Japanese\r\nideas of decency, and frequent conversation with refined and intelligent\r\nJapanese ladies upon this subject, has led me to the following\r\nconclusion. According to the Japanese standard, any exposure of the\r\nperson that is merely incidental to health, cleanliness, or convenience\r\nin doing necessary work, is perfectly modest and allowable; but an\r\nexposure, no matter how slight, that is simply for show, is in the\r\nhighest degree indelicate. In illustration of the first part of this\r\nconclusion, I would refer to the open bath-houses, the naked laborers,\r\nthe exposure of the lower limbs in wet weather by the turning up of the\r\n_kimono_, the entirely nude condition of the country children in summer,\r\nand the very slight clothing that even adults regard as necessary about\r\nthe house or in the country during the hot season. In illustration of\r\nthe last part, I would mention the horror with which many Japanese\r\nladies regard that style of foreign dress which, while covering the\r\nfigure completely, reveals every detail of the form above the waist,\r\nand, as we say, shows off to advantage a pretty figure. To the Japanese\r\nmind it is immodest to want to show off a pretty figure. As for the\r\nball-room costumes, where neck and arms are freely exposed to the gaze\r\nof multitudes, the Japanese woman, who would with entire composure take\r\nher bath in the presence of others, would be in an agony of shame at the\r\nthought of appearing in public in a costume so indecent as that worn by\r\nmany respectable American and European women. Our judgment would indeed\r\nbe a hasty one, should we conclude that the sense of decency is wanting\r\nin the Japanese as a race, or that the women are at all lacking in the\r\nwomanly instinct of modesty. When the point of view from which they\r\nregard these matters is once obtained, the apparent inconsistencies and\r\nincongruities are fully explained, and we can do justice to our\r\nJapanese sister in a matter in regard to which she is too often cruelly\r\nmisjudged.\r\n\r\nThere seems no doubt at all that among the peasantry of Japan one finds\r\nthe women who have the most freedom and independence. Among this class,\r\nall through the country, the women, though hard-worked and possessing\r\nfew comforts, lead lives of intelligent, independent labor, and have in\r\nthe family positions as respected and honored as those held by women in\r\nAmerica. Their lives are fuller and happier than those of the women of\r\nthe higher classes, for they are themselves bread-winners, contributing\r\nan important part of the family revenue, and they are obeyed and\r\nrespected accordingly. The Japanese lady, at her marriage, lays aside\r\nher independent existence to become the subordinate and servant of her\r\nhusband and parents-in-law, and her face, as the years go by, shows how\r\nmuch she has given up, how completely she has sacrificed herself to\r\nthose about her. The Japanese peasant woman, when she marries, works\r\nside by side with her husband, finds life full of interest outside of\r\nthe simple household work, and, as the years go by, her face shows more\r\nindividuality, more pleasure in life, less suffering and disappointment,\r\nthan that of her wealthier and less hard-working sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE CITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great cities of Japan afford remarkable opportunities for seeing the\r\nlife of the common people, for the little houses and shops, with their\r\nopen fronts, reveal the _penetralia_ in a way not known in our more\r\nsecluded homes. The employment of the merchant being formerly the lowest\r\nof respectable callings, one does not find even yet in Japan many great\r\nstores or a very high standard of business morality, for the business of\r\nthe country was left in the hands of those who were too stupid or too\r\nunambitious to raise themselves above that social class. Hence English\r\nand American merchants, who only see Japan from the business side,\r\ncontinually speak of the Japanese as dishonest, tricky, and altogether\r\nunreliable, and greatly prefer to deal with the Chinese, who have much\r\nof the business virtue that is characteristic of the English as a\r\nnation. Only within a few years have the samurai, or indeed any one who\r\nwas capable of figuring in any higher occupation in life, been willing\r\nto adopt the calling of the merchant; but many of the abler Japanese of\r\nto-day have begun to see that trade is one of the most important factors\r\nof a nation's well-being, and that the business of buying and selling,\r\nif wisely and honestly done, is an employment that nobody need be\r\nashamed to enter. There are in Japan a few great merchants whose word\r\nmay be trusted, and whose obligations will be fulfilled with absolute\r\nhonesty; but a large part of the buying and selling is still in the\r\nhands of mercantile freebooters, who will take an advantage wherever it\r\nis possible to get one, in whose morality honesty has no place, and who\r\nhave not yet discovered the efficacy of that virtue simply as a matter\r\nof policy. Their trade, conducted in a small way upon small means, is\r\nmore of the nature of a game, in which one person is the winner and the\r\nother the loser, than a fair exchange, in which both parties obtain what\r\nthey want. It is the mediæval, not the modern idea of business, that is\r\nstill held among Japanese merchants. With them, trade is a warfare\r\nbetween buyer and seller, in which every man must take all possible\r\nadvantage for himself, and it is the lookout of the other party if he is\r\ncheated.\r\n\r\nIn T[=o]ky[=o], the greatest and most modernized of the cities of the\r\nempire, the shops are not the large city stores that one sees in\r\nEuropean and American cities, but little open-fronted rooms, on the edge\r\nof which one sits to make one's purchases, while the proprietor smiles\r\nand bows and dickers; setting his price by the style of his customer's\r\ndress, or her apparent ignorance of the value of the desired article.\r\nSome few large dry-goods stores there are, where prices are set and\r\ndickering is unnecessary;[*264] and in the _kwankoba_, or bazaars, one\r\nmay buy almost anything needed by Japanese of all classes, from house\r\nfurnishings to foreign hats, at prices plainly marked upon them, and\r\nfrom which there is no variation. But one's impression of the state of\r\ntrade in Japan is, that it is still in a very primitive and undeveloped\r\ncondition, and is surprisingly behind the other parts of Japanese\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe shopping of the ladies of the large _yashikis_ and of wealthy\r\nfamilies is done mostly in the home; for all the stores are willing at\r\nany time, on receiving an order, to send up a clerk with a bale of\r\ncrêpes, silks, and cottons tied to his back, and frequently towering\r\nhigh above his head as he walks, making him look like the proverbial ant\r\nwith a grain of wheat. He sets his great bundle carefully down on the\r\nfloor, opens the enormous _furushiki_, or bundle handkerchief, in which\r\nit is enveloped, and takes out roll after roll of silk or chintz, neatly\r\ndone up in paper or yellow cotton. With infinite patience, he waits\r\nwhile the merits of each piece are examined and discussed, and if none\r\nof his stock proves satisfactory, he is willing to come again with a new\r\nset of wares, knowing that in the end purchases will be made sufficient\r\nto cover all his trouble.\r\n\r\nThe less aristocratic people are content to go to the stores themselves;\r\nand the business streets of a Japanese city, such as the Ginza in\r\nT[=o]ky[=o], are full of women, young and old, as well as merry\r\nchildren, who enjoy the life and bustle of the stores. Like all things\r\nelse in Japan, shopping takes plenty of time. At Mitsui's, the largest\r\nsilk store in T[=o]ky[=o], one will see crowds of clerks sitting upon\r\nthe matted floors, each with his _soroban_, or adding machine, by his\r\nside; and innumerable small boys, who rush to and fro, carrying armfuls\r\nof fabrics to the different clerks, or picking up the same fabrics after\r\nthe customer who has called for them has departed. The store appears, to\r\nthe foreign eye, to be simply a roofed and matted platform upon which\r\nboth clerks and customers sit. This platform is screened from the street\r\nby dark blue cotton curtains or awnings hung from the low projecting\r\neaves of the heavy roof. As the customers take their seats, either on\r\nthe edge of the platform, or, if they have come on an extended shopping\r\nbout, upon the straw mat of the platform itself, a small boy appears\r\nwith tea for the party; an obsequious clerk greets them with the\r\ncustomary salutations of welcome, pushes the charcoal brazier toward\r\nthem, that they may smoke, or warm their hands, before proceeding to\r\nbusiness, and then waits expectantly for the name of the goods that his\r\ncustomers desire to see. When this is given, the work begins; the little\r\nboys are summoned, and are soon sent off to the great fire-proof\r\nwarehouse, which stands with heavy doors thrown open, on the other side\r\nof the platform, away from the street. Through the doorway one can see\r\nendless piles of costly stuffs stored safely away, and from these piles\r\nthe boys select the required fabric, loading themselves down with them\r\nso that they can barely stagger under the weights that they carry. As\r\nthe right goods are not always brought the first time, and as, moreover,\r\nthere is an endless variety in the colors and patterns in even one kind\r\nof silk, there is always plenty of time for watching the busy\r\nscene,--for sipping tea, or smoking a few whiffs from the tiny pipes\r\nthat so many Japanese, both men and women, carry always with them. When\r\nthe purchase is at last made, there is still some time to be spent by\r\nthe customer in waiting until the clerk has made an abstruse calculation\r\nupon his _soroban_, the transaction has been entered in the books of the\r\nfirm, and a long bill has been written and stamped, and handed to her\r\nwith the bundle. During her stay in the store, the foreign customer,\r\nmaking her first visit to the place, is frequently startled by loud\r\nshouts from the whole staff of clerks and small boys,--outcries so\r\nsudden, so simultaneous, and so stentorian, that she cannot rid herself\r\nof the idea that something terrible is happening every time that they\r\noccur. She soon learns, however, that these manifestations of energy are\r\nbut the way in which the Japanese merchant speeds the departing\r\npurchaser, and that the apparently inarticulate shouts are but the\r\nformal phrase, \"Thanks for your continued favors,\" which is repeated in\r\na loud tone by every employee in the store whenever a customer departs.\r\nWhen she herself is at last ready to leave, a chorus of yells arises,\r\nthis time for her benefit; and as she skips into the _jinrikisha_ and is\r\nwhirled away, she hears continued the busy hum of voices, the clattering\r\nof _sorobans_, the thumping of the bare feet of the heavily laden boys,\r\nand the loud shouts of thanks with which departing guests are honored.\r\n\r\nThere is less pomp and circumstance about the smaller stores, for all\r\nthe goods are within easy reach, and the shops for household utensils\r\nand chinaware seem to have nearly the whole stock in trade piled up in\r\nfront, or even in the street itself. Many such little places are the\r\nhomes of the people who keep them. And at the back are rooms, which\r\nserve for dwelling rooms, opening upon well-kept gardens. The whole work\r\nof the store is often attended to by the proprietor, assisted by his\r\nwife and family, and perhaps one or two apprentices. Each of the\r\nworkers, in turn, takes an occasional holiday, for there is no day in\r\nthe Japanese calendar when the shops are all closed; and even New Year's\r\nDay, the great festival of the year, finds most of the stores open. Yet\r\nthe dwellers in these little homes, living almost in the street, and in\r\nthe midst of the bustle and crowd and dust of T[=o]ky[=o], have still\r\ntime to enjoy their holidays and their little gardens, and have more\r\npleasure and less hard work than those under similar circumstances in\r\nour own country.\r\n\r\nThe stranger visiting any of the great Japanese cities is surprised by\r\nthe lack of large stores and manufactories, and often wonders where the\r\nbeautiful lacquer work and porcelains are made, and where the gay silks\r\nand crêpes are woven. There are no large establishments where such\r\nthings are turned out by wholesale. The delicate vases, the bronzes,\r\nand the silks are often made in humblest homes, the work of one or two\r\nlaborers with rudest tools. There are no great manufactories to be seen,\r\nand the bane of so many cities, the polluting factory smoke, never rises\r\nover the cities of Japan. The hard, confining factory life, with its\r\nnever-ceasing roar of machinery, bewildering the minds and intellects of\r\nthe men who come under its deadening influences, until they become\r\nscarcely more than machines themselves, is a thing as yet almost unknown\r\nin Japan. The life of the _jinrikisha_ man even, hard and comfortless as\r\nit may seem to run all day like a horse through the crowded city\r\nstreets, is one that keeps him in the fresh air, under the open sky, and\r\nquickens his powers both of body and mind. To the poor in Japanese\r\ncities is never denied the fresh air and sunshine, green trees and\r\ngrass; and the beautiful parks and gardens are found everywhere, for the\r\nenjoyment of even the meanest and lowest.\r\n\r\nOn certain days in the month, in different sections of the city, are\r\nheld night festivals near temples, and many shopkeepers take the\r\nopportunity to erect temporary booths, in which they so arrange their\r\nwares as to tempt the passers-by as they go to and fro. Very often there\r\nis a magnificent display of young trees, potted plants, and flowers,\r\nbrought in from the country and ranged on both sides of the street. Here\r\nthe gardeners make lively sales, as the displays are often fine in\r\nthemselves, and show to a special advantage in the flaring torchlight.\r\nThe eager venders, who do all they can to call the attention of the\r\ncrowd to their wares, make many good bargains. The purchase requires\r\nskill on both sides, for flower men are proverbial in their high\r\ncharges, asking often five and ten times the real value of a plant, but\r\ncoming down in price almost immediately on remonstrance. You ask the\r\nprice of a dwarf wistaria growing in a pot. The man answers at once,\r\n\"Two dollars.\" \"Two dollars!\" you answer in surprise, \"it is not worth\r\nmore than thirty or forty cents.\" \"Seventy-five, then,\" he will respond;\r\nand thus the buyer and seller approach nearer in price, until the\r\nbargain is struck somewhere near the first price offered. Price another\r\nplant and there would be the same process to go over again; but as the\r\nevening passes, prices go lower and lower, for the distances that the\r\nplants have been brought are great, and the labor of loading up and\r\ncarrying back the heavy pots is a weary one, and when the last customer\r\nhas departed the merchants must work late into the night to get their\r\nwares safely home again.\r\n\r\nBut beside the flower shows, there are long rows of booths, which, with\r\nthe many visitors who throng the streets, make a gay and lively scene.\r\nSo dense is the crowd that it is with difficulty one can push through on\r\nfoot or in _jinrikisha_. The darkness is illuminated by torches, whose\r\nweird flames flare and smoke in the wind, and shine down upon the little\r\nsheds which line both sides of the road, and contain so tempting a\r\ndisplay of cheap toys and trinkets that not only the children, but their\r\nelders, are attracted by them. Some of the booths are devoted to dolls;\r\nothers to toys of various kinds; still others to birds in cages,\r\ngoldfish in globes, queer chirping insects in wicker baskets, pretty\r\nornaments for the hair, fans, candies, and cakes of all sorts, roasted\r\nbeans and peanuts, and other things too numerous to mention. The long\r\nline of stalls ends with booths, or tents, in which shows of dancing,\r\njugglery, educated animals, and monstrosities, natural or artificial,\r\nmay be seen for the moderate admission fee of two sen. Each of these\r\nshows is well advertised by the beating of drums, by the shouting of\r\ndoorkeepers, by wonderful pictures on the outside to entice the\r\npasser-by, or even by an occasional brief lifting of the curtains which\r\nveil the scene from the crowd without, just long enough to afford a\r\ntantalizing glimpse of the wonders within. Great is the fascination to\r\nthe children in all these things, and the little feet are never weary\r\nuntil the last booth is passed, and the quiet of neighboring streets,\r\nlighted only by wandering lanterns, strikes the home-returning party by\r\nits contrast with the light and noise of the festival. The supposed\r\nobject of the expedition, the visit to the temple, has occupied but a\r\nsmall share of time and attention, and the little hands are filled with\r\nthe amusing toys and trifles bought, and the little minds with the merry\r\nsights seen. Nor are those who remain at home forgotten, but the\r\npleasure-seekers who visit the fair carry away with them little gifts\r\nfor each member of the family, and the _O miagé_, or present given on\r\nthe return, is a regular institution of Japanese home life.[42]\r\n\r\n[42] _O miagé_ must be given, not only on the return from an evening of\r\npleasure, but also on the return from a journey or pleasure trip of any\r\nkind. As a rule, the longer the absence, the finer and more costly must\r\nbe the presents given on returning.\r\n\r\nBy ten o'clock, when the crowds have dispersed and the purchasers have\r\nall gone home and gone to bed, the busy booth-keepers take down their\r\nstalls, pack up their wares, and disappear, leaving no trace of the\r\nnight's gayeties to greet the morning sun.\r\n\r\nBeside these evening shows, which occur monthly or oftener, there are\r\nalso great festivals of the various gods, some celebrated annually,\r\nothers at intervals of some years. These _matsuri_ last for several\r\ndays, and during that time the quarter of the city in which they occur\r\nseems entirely given over to festivity. The streets are gayly decorated\r\nwith flags, and bright lanterns--all alike in design and color--are hung\r\nin rows from the low eaves of the houses. Young bamboo-trees set along\r\nthe street, and decorated with bits of bright-colored tissue paper, are\r\na frequent and effective accompaniment of these festivals, and here and\r\nthere throughout the district are set up high stands, on the tops of\r\nwhich musicians with squeaky flutes, and drums of varying calibre, keep\r\nup a din more festive than harmonious. It takes a day or two for the\r\nrejoicings to get fully under way, but by the second or third day the\r\nfun is at its height, and the streets are thronged with merrymakers. A\r\ngreat deal of labor and strength, as well as ingenuity, is spent in the\r\nconstruction of enormous floats, or _dashi_, lofty platforms of two\r\nstories, either set on wheels and drawn by black bullocks or crowds of\r\nshouting men, or carried by poles on men's shoulders. Upon the first\r\nfloor of these great floats is usually a company of dancers, or mummers,\r\nwho dance, attitudinize, or make faces for the amusement of the crowds\r\nthat gather along their route; while up above, an effigy of some hero in\r\nJapanese history, or the figure of some animal or monster, looks down\r\nunmoved upon the absurdities below. Each _dashi_ is attended, not only\r\nby the men who draw it, but by companies of others in some uniform\r\ncostume; and sometimes graceful professional dancing-girls are hired to\r\nmarch in the _matsuri_ procession, or to dance upon the lofty _dashi_.\r\nAt the time of the festivities which accompanied the promulgation of the\r\nConstitution, three days of jollification were held in T[=o]ky[=o], days\r\nof such universal fun and frolic that it will be known among the common\r\npeople, to all succeeding generations, as the \"Emperor's big _matsuri_.\"\r\nEvery quarter of the city vied with every other in the production of\r\ngorgeous _dashi_, and the streets were gay with every conceivable\r\nvariety of decoration, from the little red-and-white paper lanterns,\r\nthat even the poorest hung before their houses, to the great evergreen\r\narches, set with electric lights, with which the great business streets\r\nwere spanned thickly from end to end. An evening walk through one of\r\nthese thoroughfares was a sight to be remembered for a lifetime. The\r\nmagnificent _dashi_ represented all manner of quaint conceits. A great\r\nbivalve drawn by yelling crowds--which halted occasionally--opened and\r\ndisplayed between its shells a group of beautifully dressed girls, who\r\ndanced one of the pantomimic dances of the country, accompanied by the\r\ntwanging melodies of the _samisen_. Then slowly the great shell closed,\r\nonce more the shouting crowds seized hold of the straining ropes, and\r\nthe great bivalve with its fair freight was drawn slowly along through\r\nthe gayly illuminated streets. Jimmu Tenno and other heroes of Japanese\r\nlegend or history, each upon its lofty platform, a white elephant, and\r\ncountless other subjects were represented in the festival cars sent\r\nforth by all the districts of the city to celebrate the great event.\r\n\r\nUpon such festival occasions the shopkeeper does not put up his shutters\r\nand leave his place of business, but the open shop-fronts add much to\r\nthe gay appearance of the street. There are no signs of business about,\r\nbut the floor of the shop is covered with bright-red blankets;\r\nmagnificent gilded screens form an imposing background to the little\r\nroom; and seated on the floor are the shopkeeper, his family, and\r\nguests, eating, drinking tea, and smoking, as cosily as if all the world\r\nand his wife were not gazing upon the gay and homelike interior.\r\nSometimes companies of dancers, or other entertainments furnished by the\r\nwealthier shopkeepers, will attract gaping crowds, who watch and block\r\nthe street until the advance guard of some approaching _dashi_ scatters\r\nthem for a moment.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, as in other parts of the world, the country people are rather\r\nlooked down upon by the dwellers in the city for their slowness of\r\nintellect, dowdiness of dress, and boorishness of manners; while the\r\ncountry people make fun of the fads and fashions of the city, and\r\nrejoice that they are not themselves the slaves of novelty, and\r\nespecially of the foreign innovations that play so prominent a part in\r\nJapanese city life to-day. \"The frog in the well knows not the great\r\nocean,\" is the snub with which the Japanese cockney sets down Farmer\r\nRice-Field's expressions of opinion; while the conservative countryman\r\nlaughs at the foreign affectations of the T[=o]ky[=o] man, and returns\r\nto his village with tales of the cookery of the capital: so extravagant\r\nis it that sugar is used in everything; it is even rumored that the\r\nT[=o]ky[=o]ites put sugar in their tea.\r\n\r\nBut while the country laughs and wonders at the city, nevertheless, in\r\nJapan as elsewhere, there is a constant crowding of the young life of\r\nthe country into the livelier and more entertaining city. T[=o]ky[=o]\r\nespecially is the goal of every young countryman's ambition, and thither\r\nhe goes to seek his fortune, finding, alas! too often, only the hard lot\r\nof the _jinrikisha_ man, instead of the wealth and power that his\r\ncountry dreams had shown him.\r\n\r\nThe lower class women of the cities are in many respects like their\r\nsisters of the rural districts, except that they have less freedom than\r\nthe country women in what the economists call \"direct production.\" The\r\nwells and water tanks that stand at convenient distances along the\r\nstreets of T[=o]ky[=o] are frequently surrounded by crowds of women,\r\ndrawing water, washing rice, and chattering merrily over their\r\noccupations. They meet and exchange ideas freely with each other and\r\nwith the men, but they have not the diversity of labor that country life\r\naffords, confining themselves more closely to indoor and domestic work,\r\nand leaving the bread-winning more entirely to the men.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, occupations in the city for women, by which they may\r\nsupport themselves or their families. A good hair-dresser may make a\r\nhandsome living; indeed, she does so well that it is proverbial among\r\nthe Japanese that a hair-dresser's husband has nothing to do. Though\r\nprofessional tailors are mostly men, many women earn a small pittance in\r\ntaking in sewing and in giving sewing lessons; and as instructors in the\r\nceremonial tea, etiquette, music, painting, and flower arrangement, many\r\nwomen of the old school are able to earn an independence, though none of\r\nthese occupations are confined to the women alone.\r\n\r\nThe business of hotel-keeping we have referred to in a previous chapter,\r\nand it is a well-known fact that unless a hotel-keeper has a capable\r\nwife, his business will not succeed. At present, all over T[=o]ky[=o],\r\nsmall restaurants, where food is served in the foreign style, are\r\nspringing up, and these are usually conducted by a man and his wife who\r\nhave at some time served as cook and waitress in a foreign family, and\r\nwho conduct the business cöoperatively and on terms of good-fellowship\r\nand equality. In these little eating-houses, where a well-cooked foreign\r\ndinner of from three to six courses is served for the moderate sum of\r\nthirty or forty cents, the man usually does the cooking, the woman the\r\nserving and handling of the money, until the time arrives when the\r\nprofits of the business are sufficient to justify the hiring of more\r\nhelp. When this time comes, the labor is redistributed, the woman\r\nfrequently taking upon herself the reception of the guests and the\r\nkeeping of the accounts, while the hired help waits on the tables.\r\n\r\nOne important calling, in the eyes of many persons, especially those of\r\nthe lower classes, is that of fortune-telling; and these guides in all\r\nmatters of life, both great and small, are to be found in every section\r\nof the city. They are consulted on every important step by believing\r\nones of all classes. An impending marriage, an illness, the loss of any\r\nvaluable article, a journey about to be taken,--these are all subjects\r\nfor the fortune-teller. He tells the right day of marriage, and says\r\nwhether the fates of the two parties will combine well; gives clues to\r\nthe causes of sudden illness, and information as to what has become of\r\nlost articles, and whether they will be recovered or not. Warned thus by\r\nthe fortune-teller against evils that may happen, many ingenious\r\nexpedients are resorted to, to avoid the ill foretold.\r\n\r\nA man and his family were about to move from their residence to another\r\npart of the city. They sent to know if the fates were propitious to the\r\nchange for all the family. The day and year of birth of each was told,\r\nand then the fortune-teller hunted up the various signs, and sent word\r\nthat the direction of the new home was excellent for the good luck of\r\nthe family as a whole, and the move a good one for each member of it\r\nexcept one of the sons; the next year the same move would be bad for the\r\nfather. As the family could not wait two years before moving, it was\r\ndecided that the change of residence should be made at once, but that\r\nthe son should live with his uncle until the next year. The uncle's home\r\nwas, however, inconveniently remote, and so the young man stayed as a\r\nvisitor at his father's house for the remaining months of the year,\r\nafter which he became once more a member of the household. Thus the\r\ninconvenience and the evil were both avoided.[*282]\r\n\r\nAnother story comes to my mind now of a dear old lady, the Go Inkyo Sama\r\nof a house of high rank, who late in life came to T[=o]ky[=o] to live\r\nwith her brother and his young and somewhat foreignized wife. The\r\nbrother himself, while not a Christian, had little belief in the old\r\nsuperstitions of his people; his wife was a professing Christian. Soon\r\nafter the old lady's arrival in T[=o]ky[=o], her sister-in-law fell ill,\r\nand before she had recovered her strength the children, one after\r\nanother, came down with various diseases, which, though in no case\r\nfatal, kept the family in a state of anxiety for more than a year. The\r\nold lady was quite sure that there was some witchcraft or art-magic at\r\nwork among her dear ones, and, after consulting the servants (for she\r\nknew that she could expect no sympathy in her plans from either her\r\nbrother or his wife), she betook herself to a fortune-teller to discover\r\nthrough his means the causes of the illness in the family. The\r\nfortune-teller revealed to her the fact that two occult forces were at\r\nwork bringing evil upon the house. One was the evil spirit of a spring\r\nor well that had been choked with stones, or otherwise obstructed in its\r\nflow, and that chose this way of bringing its afflictions to the\r\nattention of mortals. The other was the spirit of a horse that had once\r\nbelonged in the family, and that after death revenged itself upon its\r\nformer masters for the hard service wherewith it had been made to serve.\r\nThe only way in which these two powers could be appeased would be by\r\nfinding the well, and removing the obstructions that choked it, and by\r\nerecting an image of the horse and offering to it cakes and other\r\nmeat-offerings. The fortune-teller hinted, moreover, that for a\r\nconsideration he might be able to afford material aid in the search for\r\nthe well.\r\n\r\nAt this information Go Inkyo Sama was much perturbed, for further aid\r\nfor her afflicted family seemed to require the use of money, and of that\r\ncommodity she had very little, being mainly dependent upon her brother\r\nfor support. She returned to her home and consulted the servants upon\r\nthe matter; but though they quite agreed with her that something should\r\nbe done, they had little capital to invest in the enterprises suggested\r\nby the fortune-teller. At last, the old lady went to her brother, but he\r\nonly laughed at her well-meant attempts to help his family, and refused\r\nto give her money for such a purpose. She retired discouraged, but,\r\nurged by the servants, she decided to make a last appeal, this time to\r\nher sister-in-law, who must surely be moved by the evil that was\r\nthreatening herself and her children. Taking some of the head servants\r\nwith her, she went to her sister and presented the case. This was her\r\nlast resort, and she clung to her forlorn hope longer than many would\r\nhave done, the servants adding their arguments to her impassioned\r\nappeals, only to find out after all that the steadfast sister could not\r\nbe moved, and that she would not propitiate the horse's spirit, or allow\r\nmoney to be used for such a purpose. She gave it up then, and sat down\r\nto await the fate of her doomed house, doubtless wondering much and\r\nsighing often over the foolish skepticism of her near relatives, and\r\nwishing that the rationalistic tendencies of the time would take a less\r\ndangerous form than the neglecting of the plainest precautions for life\r\nand health. The fate has not yet come, and now at last Go Inkyo Sama\r\nseems to have resigned herself to the belief that it has been averted\r\nfrom the heads of the dear ones by a power unknown to the\r\nfortune-teller.\r\n\r\nBeside these callings, there are other employments which are not\r\nregarded as wholly respectable by either Japanese or foreigners. The\r\n_géisha ya_, or establishments where dancing-girls are trained, and let\r\nout by the day or evening to tea-houses or private parties, are usually\r\nmanaged by women. At these establishments little girls are taken,\r\nsometimes by contract with their parents, sometimes adopted by the\r\nproprietors of the house, and from very early youth are trained not only\r\nin the art of dancing, but are taught singing and _samisen_-playing, all\r\nthe etiquette of serving and entertaining guests, and whatever else goes\r\nto make a girl charming to the opposite sex. When thoroughly taught,\r\nthey form a valuable investment, and well repay the labor spent upon\r\nthem, for a popular géisha commands a good price everywhere, and has her\r\ntime overcrowded with engagements. A Japanese entertainment is hardly\r\nregarded as complete without géishas in attendance, and their dancing,\r\nmusic, and graceful service at supper form a charming addition to an\r\nevening of enjoyment at a tea-house. It is these géishas, too, who at\r\n_matsuri_ are hired to march in quaint uniforms in the procession, or,\r\nborne aloft on great _dashi_, dance for the benefit of the admiring\r\ncrowds.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese dances are charmingly graceful and modest; the swaying of\r\nthe body and limbs, the artistic management of the flowing draperies,\r\nthe variety of themes and costumes of the different dances, all go to\r\nmake an entertainment by géishas one of the pleasantest of Japanese\r\nenjoyments. Sometimes, in scarlet and yellow robes, the dainty maidens\r\nimitate, with their supple bodies, the dance of the maple leaves as they\r\nare driven hither and thither in the autumn wind; sometimes, with\r\ntucked-up _kimonos_ and jaunty red petticoats, they play the part of\r\nlittle country girls carrying their eggs to market in the neighboring\r\nvillage. Again, clad in armor, they simulate the warlike gestures and\r\nmartial stamp of some of the old-time heroes; or, with whitened faces\r\nand hoary locks, they perform with rake and broom the dance of the good\r\nold man and old woman who play so prominent a part in Japanese pictures.\r\nAnd then, when the dance is over, and all are bewitched with their grace\r\nand beauty, they descend to the supper-room and ply their temporary\r\nemployers with the _saké_ bottle, laughing and jesting the while, until\r\nthere is little wonder if the young men at the entertainment drink more\r\nthan is good for them, and leave the tea-house at last thoroughly tipsy,\r\nand enslaved by the bright eyes and merry wits of some of the Hebes who\r\nhave beguiled them through the evening.\r\n\r\nThe géishas unfortunately, though fair, are frail. In their system of\r\neducation, manners stand higher than morals, and many a géisha gladly\r\nleaves the dancing in the tea-houses to become the concubine of some\r\nwealthy Japanese or foreigner, thinking none the worse of herself for\r\nsuch a business arrangement, and going cheerfully back to her regular\r\nwork, should her contract be unexpectedly ended. The géisha is not\r\nnecessarily bad, but there is in her life much temptation to evil, and\r\nlittle stimulus to do right, so that, where one lives blameless, many go\r\nwrong, and drop below the margin of respectability altogether. Yet so\r\nfascinating, bright, and lively are these géishas that many of them have\r\nbeen taken by men of good position as wives, and are now the heads of\r\nthe most respectable homes. Without true education or morals, but\r\ntrained thoroughly in all the arts and accomplishments that\r\nplease,--witty, quick at repartee, pretty, and always well dressed,--the\r\ngéisha has proved a formidable rival for the demure, quiet maiden of\r\ngood family, who can only give her husband an unsullied name, silent\r\nobedience, and faithful service all her life. The freedom of the present\r\nage, as shown in the chapter on \"Marriage and Divorce,\" and as seen in\r\nthe choice of such wives, has presented this great problem to the\r\nthinking women of Japan. If the wives of the leaders in Japan are to\r\ncome from among such a class of women, something must be done, and done\r\nquickly, for the sake of the future of Japan; either to raise the\r\nstandards of the men in regard to women, or to change the old system of\r\neducation for girls. A liberal education, and more freedom in early life\r\nfor women, has been suggested, and is now being tried, but the problem\r\nof the géisha and her fascination is a deep one in Japan.\r\n\r\nBelow the géisha in respectability stands the j[=o]r[=o], or licensed\r\nprostitute. Every city in Japan has its disreputable quarter, where the\r\nvarious _j[=o]r[=o]ya_, or licensed houses of prostitution, are\r\nsituated. The supervision that the government exercises over these\r\nplaces is extremely rigid; the effort is made, by licensing and\r\nregulating them, to minimize the evils that must flow from them. The\r\nproprietors of the _j[=o]r[=o]ya_ do everything in their power to make\r\ntheir houses, grounds, and employees attractive, and, to the\r\nunsuspecting foreigner, this portion of the city seems often the\r\npleasantest and most respectable. A j[=o]r[=o] need never be taken for a\r\nrespectable woman, for her dress is distinctive, and a stay of a short\r\ntime in Japan is long enough to teach even the most obtuse that the\r\n_obi_, or sash, tied in front instead of behind, is one of the badges of\r\nshame. But though the occupation of the j[=o]r[=o] is altogether\r\ndisreputable,--though the prostitute quarter is the spot to which the\r\npolice turn for information in regard to criminals and law-breakers, a\r\nsort of a trap into which, sooner or later, the offender against the law\r\nis sure to fall,--Japanese public opinion, though recognizing the evil\r\nas a great one, does not look upon the professional prostitute with the\r\nloathing which she inspires in Christian countries. The reason for this\r\nlies, not solely in the lower moral standards although it is true that\r\nsins of this character are regarded much more leniently in Japan than in\r\nEngland or America. The reason lies very largely in the fact that these\r\nwomen are seldom free agents. Many of them are virtually slaves, sold in\r\nchildhood to the keepers of the houses in which they work, and trained,\r\namid the surroundings of the _j[=o]r[=o]ya_, for the life which is the\r\nonly life they have ever known. A few may have sacrificed themselves\r\nfreely but reluctantly for those whom they love, and by their revolting\r\nslavery may be earning the means to keep their dear ones from starvation\r\nor disgrace. Many are the Japanese romances that are woven about the\r\nvirtuous j[=o]r[=o], who is eventually rewarded by finding, even in the\r\n_j[=o]r[=o]ya_, a lover who is willing to raise her again to a life of\r\nrespectability, and make her a happy wife and the mother of children.\r\nSuch stories must necessarily lower the standard of morals in regard to\r\nchastity, but in a country in which innocent romance has little room for\r\ndevelopment, the imagination must find its materials where it can.\r\nThese _j[=o]r[=o]ya_ give employment to thousands of women throughout\r\nthe country, but in few cases do the women seek that employment, and\r\nmore openings in respectable directions, together with a change in\r\npublic opinion securing to every woman the right to her own person,\r\nwould tend to diminish the number of victims that these institutions\r\nyearly draw into their devouring current.\r\n\r\nInnocent and reputable amusements are many and varied in the cities. We\r\nhave already mentioned incidentally the theatre as one of the favorite\r\ndiversions of the people; and though it has never been regarded as a\r\nvery refined amusement, it has done and is doing much for the education\r\nof the lower classes in the history and spirit of former times. Regular\r\nplays were never performed in the presence of the Emperor and his court,\r\nor the Sh[=o]gun and his nobles, but the _No_ dance was the only\r\ndramatic amusement of the nobility. This _No_ is an ancient Japanese\r\ntheatrical performance, more, perhaps, like the Greek drama than\r\nanything in our modern life. All the movements of the actors are\r\nmeasured and conventionalized, speech is a poetical recitative, the\r\ncostumes are stiff and antique, masks are much used, and a chorus seated\r\nupon the stage chants audible comments upon the various situations. This\r\nalone, the most ancient and classical of Japanese theatrical\r\nperformances, is considered worthy of the attention of the Emperor and\r\nthe nobility, and takes the place with them of the more vulgar and\r\nrealistic plays which delight common people.\r\n\r\nThe regular theatre preserves in many ways the life and costumes of old\r\nJapan, and the details of dress and scenery are most carefully studied.\r\nThe actors are usually men, though there are \"women theatres\" in which\r\nall the parts are performed by women. In no case are the rôles taken by\r\nboth sexes upon one stage. As the performances last all day, from ten or\r\neleven in the forenoon until eight or nine in the evening, going to the\r\ntheatre means much more than a few hours of entertainment after the\r\nday's work is over. A lunch and dinner, with innumerable light edibles\r\nbetween, go to make up the usual bill of fare for a day at the play, and\r\ntea-houses in the neighborhood of the theatre provide the necessary\r\nmeals, a room to take them in, a resting-place between the acts, and\r\nwhatever tea, cakes, and other refreshments may be ordered. These latter\r\neatables are served by the attendants of the tea-house in the theatre\r\nboxes while the play is in progress, and the playgoers eat and smoke all\r\nday long through roaring farce or goriest tragedy.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the theatre in many ways are the public halls, where\r\nprofessional story-tellers, the _hanashika_, night after night, relate\r\nlong stories to crowded audiences, as powerfully and vividly as the best\r\ntrained elocutionist. Each gesture, and each modulation of the voice, is\r\nstudied as carefully as are those of the actors. Many charming tales are\r\ntold of old Japan, and even Western stories have found their way to\r\nthese assemblies. A long story is often continued from night to night\r\nuntil finished. Unfortunately, the class of people who patronize these\r\nplaces is low, and the moral tone of some of the stories is pitched\r\naccordingly; but the best of the story-tellers--those who have talent\r\nand reputation--are often invited to come to entertainments given at\r\nprivate houses, to amuse a large company by their eloquence or mimicry.\r\n\r\nThis is a very favorite entertainment, and the _hanashika_ has so\r\nperfected the art of imitation that he can change in a moment from the\r\ntones of a child to those of an old woman. Solemn and sad subjects are\r\ntouched upon, as well as merry and bright things, and he never fails to\r\nmake his audience weep or laugh, according to his theme, and well merits\r\nthe applause he always receives at the end.\r\n\r\nThe _hanami_, or picnic to famous places to view certain flowers as they\r\nbloom in their season, though not belonging strictly to city life, forms\r\none of the greatest of the pleasures of city people. The river Sumida,\r\non which T[=o]ky[=o] is situated, has lining its eastern shore for some\r\nmiles the famous cherry-trees of Japan, with their large, double pink\r\nblossoms, and when, in April and May, these flowers are in their\r\nperfection, great crowds of sightseers flock to Muk[=o]jima to enjoy the\r\nblossoms under the trees. The river is crowded with picnic parties in\r\nboats. Every tea-house along the banks is full of guests, and the little\r\nstalls and resting-places on the way find a quick sale for fruit,\r\nconfectionery, and light lunches. _Saké_ is often too freely imbibed by\r\nthe merrymakers, whose flushed faces show, when returning homeward, how\r\ntheir day was spent. There is much quiet enjoyment, too, of the lovely\r\nblossoms, the broad, calm river, and the gayly dressed crowds. Hundreds\r\nand thousands of visitors crowd to the suburban places about\r\nT[=o]ky[=o],--to Uyéno Park for its cherry and peach blossoms, Kaméido\r\nfor the plum and wistaria, Oji for its famous maple-trees, and many\r\nothers, each noted for some special beauty. Dango Zaka has its own\r\npeculiar attraction, the famous chrysanthemum dolls. These ingenious\r\nfigures are arranged so as to form tableaux,--scenes from history or\r\nfiction well known to all the people. They are of life size, and the\r\nfaces, hands, and feet are made of some composition, and closely\r\nresemble life in every detail. But the curious thing in these tableaux\r\nis that the scenery, whether it be the representation of a waterfall,\r\nrocks, or bushes, the animals, and the dresses of the figures are made\r\nentirely of chrysanthemum twigs, leaves, and flowers, not cut and woven\r\nin, as at the first glance they seem to be,--so closely are the leaves\r\nand flowers bound together to make the flat surface of different\r\nobjects,--but alive and growing on the plants. It is impossible to tell\r\nwhere the roots and stems are hidden, for nothing is visible but (for\r\nexample) the white spray and greenish shadows of a waterfall, or the\r\nparti-colored figures in a young girl's dress. But, should it be the\r\nvisitor's good fortune to watch the repairing of one of these lifelike\r\nimages, he will find that the entire body is a frame woven of split\r\nbamboo, within which the plants are placed, their roots packed in damp\r\nearth and bound about with straw, while their leaves and flowers are\r\npulled through the basket frame and woven into whatsoever pattern the\r\nartistic eye and skillful fingers of the gardener may select. A roof of\r\nmatting shields each group from the sun by day, and a slight sprinkling\r\nevery night serves to keep the plants fresh for nearly a month, and the\r\nflowers continue their blooming during that time, as calmly as if in\r\nperfectly natural positions. Each of the gardeners of the neighborhood\r\nhas his own little show, containing several tableaux, the entrance to\r\nwhich is guarded by an officious gate-keeper, who shouts out the merits\r\nof his particular groups of figures, and forces his show-bills upon the\r\npasser-by, in the hope of securing the two sen admission fee which is\r\nrequired for each exhibit.\r\n\r\nAnd so, amid the shopping, the festivals, the amusements of the great\r\ncities, the women find their lives varied in many ways. Their holidays\r\nfrom home duties are spent amid these enjoyments; and if they have not\r\nthe out-of-door employments, the long walks up the mountains, the days\r\nspent in tea-picking, in harvesting, in all the varied work that comes\r\nto the country woman, the dwellers in the city have no lack of sights\r\nand sounds to amuse and interest them, and would not often care to\r\nexchange their lot for the freer and hardier life of the rustic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC SERVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the foreigner, upon his arrival in Japan, the status of household\r\nservants is at first a source of much perplexity. There is a freedom in\r\ntheir relations with the families that they serve, that in this country\r\nwould be regarded as impudence, and an independence of action that, in\r\nmany cases, seems to take the form of direct disobedience to orders.\r\nFrom the steward of your household, who keeps your accounts, makes your\r\npurchases, and manages your affairs, to your _jinrikisha_ man or groom,\r\nevery servant in your establishment does what is right in his own eyes,\r\nand after the manner that he thinks best. Mere blind obedience to orders\r\nis not regarded as a virtue in a Japanese servant; he must do his own\r\nthinking, and, if he cannot grasp the reason for your order, that order\r\nwill not be carried out. Housekeeping in Japan is frequently the despair\r\nof the thrifty American housewife, who has been accustomed in her own\r\ncountry to be the head of every detail of household work, leaving to her\r\nservants only the mechanical labor of the hands. She begins by showing\r\nher Oriental help the work to be done, and just the way in which she is\r\naccustomed to having it done at home, and the chances are about one in a\r\nhundred that her servant will carry out her instructions. In the\r\nninety-nine other cases, he will accomplish the desired result, but by\r\nmeans totally different from those to which the American housekeeper is\r\naccustomed. If the housewife is one of the worrying kind, who cares as\r\nmuch about the way in which the thing is done as about the accomplished\r\nresult, the chances are that she will wear herself out in a fruitless\r\nendeavor to make her servants do things in her own way, and will, when\r\nshe returns to America, assure you that Japanese servants are the most\r\nidle, stupid, and altogether worthless lot that it was ever her bad\r\nfortune to have to do with. But on the other hand, if the lady of the\r\nhouse is one who is willing to give general orders, and then sit down\r\nand wait until the work is done before criticising it, she will find\r\nthat by some means or other the work will be accomplished and her desire\r\nwill be carried out, provided only that her servants see a reason for\r\ngetting the thing done. And as she finds that her domestics will take\r\nresponsibility upon themselves, and will work, not only with their\r\nhands, but with the will and intellect in her service, she soon yields\r\nto their protecting and thoughtful care for herself and her interests,\r\nand, when she returns to America, is loud in her praises of the\r\ncompetence and devotion of her Japanese servants. Even in the treaty\r\nports, where contact with foreigners has given to the Japanese\r\nattendants the silent and repressed air that we regard as the standard\r\nmanner for a servant, they have not resigned their right of private\r\njudgment, but, if faithful and honest, seek the best good of their\r\nemployer, even if his best good involves disobedience of his orders.\r\nThis characteristic of the Japanese servant is aggravated when he is in\r\nthe employment of foreigners, for the simple reason that he is apt to\r\nregard the foreigner as a species of imbecile, who must be cared for\r\ntenderly because he is quite incompetent to care for himself, but whose\r\nfancies must not be too much regarded. Of the relations of foreign\r\nemployers and Japanese servants much might be said, but our business is\r\nwith the position of the servants in a Japanese household.\r\n\r\nUnder the old feudal system, the servants of every family were its\r\nhereditary retainers, and from generation to generation desired no\r\nhigher lot than personal service in the family to which they belonged.\r\nThe principle of loyalty to the family interests was the leading\r\nprinciple in the lives of the servants, just as loyalty to the daimi[=o]\r\nwas the highest duty of the samurai. Long and intimate knowledge of the\r\nfamily history and traits of character rendered it possible for the\r\nretainer to work intelligently for his master, and do independently for\r\nhim many things without orders. The servant in many cases knew his\r\nmaster and his master's interests as well as the master himself, or even\r\nbetter, and must act by the light of his own knowledge in cases where\r\nhis master was ignorant or misinformed. One can easily see how ties of\r\ngood-fellowship and sympathy would arise between masters and servants,\r\nhow a community of interest would exist, so that the good of the master\r\nand his family would be the condition for the good of the servant and\r\nhis family. In America, where the relation between servant and employer\r\nis usually a simple business arrangement, each giving certain specified\r\nconsiderations and nothing more, the relation of servant to master is\r\nshorn of all sentiment and affection; the servant's interests are quite\r\napart from those of his employer, and his main object is to get the\r\nspecified work done and obtain more time for himself, and sooner or\r\nlater to leave the despised occupation of domestic service for some\r\nhigher and more independent calling. In Japan, where faithful service of\r\na master was regarded as a calling worthy of absorbing any one's highest\r\nabilities through a lifetime, the position of a servant was not menial\r\nor degrading, but might be higher than that of the farmer, merchant, or\r\nartisan. Whether the position was a high or a low one depended, not so\r\nmuch on the work done, as the person for whom it was done, and the\r\nservant of a daimi[=o] or high rank samurai was worthy of more honor, and\r\nmight be of far better birth, than the independent merchant or artisan.\r\nAs the former feudal system is yet within the memory of many of the\r\npresent generation, and its feelings still alive in Japan, much of the\r\nold sentiment remains, even with the merely hired domestics in a\r\nhousehold of the present day. The servant, by his own master, is\r\naddressed by name, with no title of respect, is treated as an inferior,\r\nand spoken to in the language used toward inferiors; but to all others\r\nhe is a person to be treated with respect,--to be bowed to profoundly,\r\naddressed by the title San, and spoken to in the politest of language.\r\nYou make a call upon a Japanese household, and the servant who admits\r\nyou will expect to exchange the formal salutations with you. When you\r\nare ushered into the reception-room, should the lady of the house be\r\nabsent, the head servants will not only serve you with tea and\r\nrefreshments and offer you hospitalities in their mistress's name, but\r\nmay, if no one else be there, sit with you in the parlor, entertaining\r\nyou with conversation until the return of the hostess. The servants of\r\nthe household are by no means ignored socially, as they are with us, but\r\nare always recognized and saluted by visitors as they pass into and out\r\nof the room, and are free to join in the conversation of their betters,\r\nshould they see any place where it is possible that they may shed light\r\non the subject discussed. But though given this liberty of speech,\r\ntreated with much consideration, and having sometimes much\r\nresponsibility, servants do not forget their places in the household,\r\nand do not seem to be bold or out of place. Indeed, the manners of some\r\nof them would seem, to any one but a Japanese, to denote a lack of\r\nproper self-respect,--an excess of humility, or an affectation of it.\r\n\r\nIn explaining to my scholars, who were reading \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\"\r\nin English, a passage where a footman is spoken of as having nearly\r\ndisgraced himself by laughing at some quaint saying of the young lord,\r\nmy little peeresses were amazed beyond measure to learn that in Europe\r\nand America a servant is expected never to show any interest in, or\r\nknowledge of, the conversation of his betters, never to speak unless\r\naddressed, and never to smile under any circumstances. Doubtless, in\r\ntheir shrewd little brains, they formed their opinion of a civilization\r\nimposing such barbarous restraints upon one class of persons.\r\n\r\nThe women servants in a family are in position more like the\r\nself-respecting, old-fashioned New England \"help\" than they are like the\r\nmodern \"girl.\" They do not work all day while the mistress sits in the\r\nparlor doing nothing, and then, when their day's work is done, go out,\r\nanxious to forget, in the society of their friends, the drudgery which\r\nonly the necessity for self-support and the high wages to be earned\r\nrender tolerable. As has been explained in a previous chapter, the\r\nmistress of the house--be she princess or peasant--is herself the head\r\nservant, and only gives up to her helpers the part of the labor which\r\nshe has not the time or strength to perform. Certain menial duties\r\ntoward her husband and children, every Japanese wife and mother must do\r\nherself, and would scorn to delegate to any other woman except in case\r\nof absolute necessity. Thus there is not that gap between mistress and\r\nmaid that exists in our days among the women of this country. The\r\nservants work with their mistress, helping her in every possible way,\r\nand are treated as responsible members of the household, if not of the\r\nfamily itself.\r\n\r\nAt evening, when the wooden shutters are slid into their places around\r\nthe porch and the lamps are lighted, the family gather together in the\r\nsitting-room around the _hibachi_ to talk, free from interruption, for\r\nno visitor comes at such an hour to disturb the family circle. The\r\nmother will have her sewing or work, the children will study their\r\nlessons, and the others will talk or amuse themselves in various ways.\r\nThen, perhaps, the maidservants, having finished their tasks about the\r\nhouse, will join the circle,--always at a respectful distance,--will do\r\ntheir sewing and listen to the talk, and often join in the conversation,\r\nbut in the most humble manner. Perhaps, at times, some one more\r\nambitious than the others will bring in a book, and ask the meaning of a\r\nword or a phrase she has met in studying, and little helps of this kind\r\nare given most willingly.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the ladies-in-waiting in the houses of the nobles are\r\ndaughters of samurai, who gladly serve in these positions for the sake\r\nof the honor of such service, and the training they receive in noble\r\nhouses. In a somewhat similar way, places in the homes of those of\r\ndistinction or skill in any art or profession are held in great demand\r\namong the Japanese; and a prominent poet, scholar, physician, or\r\nprofessional man of any kind is often asked by anxious parents to take\r\ntheir sons under his own roof, so that they may be under his influence,\r\nand receive the benefits of stay in such an honorable house. The parents\r\nwho thus send their children may not be of low rank at all, but are\r\nusually not sufficiently well-to-do to spend much money in the education\r\nof their children. The position that such boys occupy in the household\r\nis a curious one. They are called _Sho-séi_, meaning students, and\r\nstudents they usually are, spending all their leisure moments and their\r\nevenings in study. They are never treated as inferiors, except in age\r\nand experience; they may or may not eat with the family, and are always\r\naddressed with respect. On the other hand, they always feel themselves\r\nto be dependents, and must be willing without wages to work in any\r\ncapacity about the house, for the sake of picking up what crumbs of\r\nknowledge may fall to them from their master's table. Service is not\r\nabsolutely demanded of them, but they are expected to do what will pay\r\nfor their board, and do not regard menial work as below them, performing\r\ncheerfully all that the master may require of them.\r\n\r\nIn this way, a man of moderate means can help along many poor young men\r\nin whom he may feel interested, and in return be saved expense about his\r\nhousehold work; and the students, while always considerately treated,\r\nare able without great expense to study,--often even to prepare for\r\ncollege, or get a start in one of the professions, for they have many\r\nleisure moments to devote to their books. Many prominent men of the\r\npresent day have been students of this class, and are now in their turn\r\nhelping the younger generation.\r\n\r\nThe boys that one sees in shops, or, with workmen of all kinds, helping\r\nin many little ways, are not hirelings, but apprentices, who hope some\r\nday to hold just as good positions as their masters, and expect to know\r\nas much, if not a great deal more. At the shop or in the home, they not\r\nonly help in the trades or occupations they are learning, but are\r\nwilling to do any kind of menial work for their master or his family in\r\nreturn for what they receive from him; for they do not pay for their\r\nboard nor for what they are taught. Even when the age of education is\r\nalready past, grown men and women are willing to leave quite independent\r\npositions to shine with reflected glory as servants of persons of high\r\nrank or distinction. \"The servant is not greater than his master\" in\r\nJapan; but if the master is great, the servant is considerably greater\r\nthan the man without a master.\r\n\r\nIn a country like Japan, where one finds but few wealthy people, there\r\nmay be cause for wonder at the large households, where there are so many\r\nservants. There will be often as many as ten or more servants in a home\r\nwhere, in other ways, luxury and wealth are not displayed. In the _oku_,\r\nor the part of the house where the lady of the house stays, are found\r\nher own maid, and women who help in the work about the house, sew in\r\ntheir leisure moments, and are the higher servants of the family; there\r\nare also the children's attendants, often one for each child, as well as\r\nthe waiting women for the Go Inkyo Sama. In the kitchen are the cooks\r\nand their assistants, the lower servants, and usually one or more\r\n_jinrikisha_ men, who belong to the house, and, if this be the home of\r\nan official who keeps horses, a _bett[=o]_ for each animal. There are also\r\ngardeners, errand-boys, and gate-keepers to guard the large _yashikis_.\r\nSuch a retinue would seem a great deal to maintain; but servants' wages\r\nare so low, and the cost of living is so small, that in this matter\r\nJapanese can afford to be luxurious. Three or four dollars will cover\r\nthe cost of food for a month for one person, and women servants expect\r\nonly a few dollars in wages for that time. The men receive much higher\r\npay, but at the most it is less than what a good cook receives in many\r\nhomes here. The wages do not include occasional presents, especially\r\nthose given semi-annually,--a small sum of money, or dress material of\r\nsome kind,--which servants expect, and which, of course, are no small\r\nitem in the family expense.\r\n\r\nHomes which maintain a great deal of style need many servants, for they\r\nexpect to work less than the American servant, and are less able to\r\nhurry and rush through their work; and they do not desire, if they\r\ncould, to take life so hard, even to earn greater pay. The family, too,\r\nin many cases are used to having plenty of hands to do the work; the\r\nladies are much less independent, and life has more formalities and red\r\ntape in Japan than in America. A great deal of the shopping is done by\r\nservants, who are sent out on errands and often do important business.\r\nMaids accompany their mistresses to make visits; servants go with\r\nparties to the theatre, to picnics, or on journeys, and these\r\nexpeditions are as heartily enjoyed by them as by their masters. It is\r\nexpected, especially of ladies and persons of high rank, that the\r\ndetails of the journey, the bargaining with coolies, the hiring of\r\nvehicles, and paying of bills, be left in charge of some manservant, who\r\nis entirely responsible, and who makes all the bargains, arranges the\r\njourney for his employer, and takes charge of everything,--even to the\r\namount of fees given along the way.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the highest positions of service now--positions honorable\r\nanywhere in Japan--are held by those who remain of the old retainers of\r\ndaimi[=o]s, and who regulate the households of the nobles. Such men must\r\nhave good education, and good judgment; for much is left in their\r\nhands, and they are usually gentlemen, who would be known as such\r\nanywhere. They are the stewards of the household, the secretaries of\r\ntheir masters; keep all accounts, for which they are responsible, and\r\nattend to the minor affairs of etiquette,--the latter no trifling duty\r\nin a noble's home. It is they who accompany the nobles on their\r\njourneys,--regulate, advise, and attend to the little affairs of life,\r\nof which the master may be ignorant and cares not to learn. They are the\r\nlast of the crowds of feudal retainers, who once filled castle and\r\n_yashiki_, and are now scattered throughout the length and breadth of\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe higher servants in the household must be always more or less trained\r\nin etiquette, and are expected to look neat and tidy; to serve guests\r\nwith tea and refreshments, without any orders to that effect; and to use\r\ntheir judgment in little household affairs, and thus help the lady of\r\nthe house. They are usually clever with their fingers, and can sew\r\nneatly. When their mistress goes out they assist her to dress, and only\r\na few words from her will be necessary for them to have everything in\r\nreadiness, from her sash and dress to all the little belongings of a\r\nlady's costume. Many a bright, quick servant is found who will\r\nunderstand and guess her mistress's wants without being told each\r\ndetail, and these not only serve with their hands, but think for their\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\nMuch less is expected of the lower servants, who belong to the kitchen,\r\nand have less to do with the family in general, and little or no\r\npersonal contact with their masters. They perform their round of duties\r\nwith little responsibility, and are regarded as much lower in the social\r\nscale of servants, of which we have seen there are many degrees.\r\n\r\nThe little _gozen-taki_, or rice-cook, who works all day in the kitchen,\r\nmay be a fat, red-cheeked, frowsy-haired country girl,--patient,\r\nhard-working, and humble-minded,--willing to pother about all day with\r\nher kettles and pans, and sit up half the night over her own sewing, or\r\nthe study of the often unfamiliar art of reading and writing; but\r\nentirely unacquainted with the details of etiquette, a knowledge of\r\nwhich is a necessity to the higher servants,--sometimes even thrown\r\ninto an agony of diffidence should it become necessary to appear before\r\nmaster or mistress.\r\n\r\nSome of the customs of the household, in regard to servants, are quite\r\nstriking to a foreigner. When the master of the house starts out each\r\nmorning, besides the wife and children who see him off, all the servants\r\nwho are not especially occupied--a goodly number, sometimes--come to the\r\nfront door and bow down to bid him good-by. On his return, also, when\r\nthe noise of the _kuruma_ is heard, and the shout of the men, who call\r\nout \"_O kaeri!_\" when near the house, the servants go out to greet him,\r\nand bowing low speak the customary words of salutation. To a greater or\r\nless degree, the same is done to every member of the family, the younger\r\nmembers, however, receiving a smaller share of the attention than their\r\nelders.\r\n\r\nWhen, as very often happens, a guest staying for any length of time in a\r\nfamily, or a frequent visitor, gives a servant a present of money or any\r\ntrifle, the servant, after thanking the donor, takes the white paper\r\nbundle to the mistress of the house, and shows it to her, expressing his\r\ngratitude to her for the gift, and also asking her to thank the giver.\r\nThis, of course, is always done, for a gift to a servant is as much of a\r\nfavor to the mistress as a present to a child is to its mother.\r\n\r\nWhen a servant wishes to leave a family, she rarely goes to her mistress\r\nand states that she is dissatisfied with her position, and that some\r\nbetter chance has been offered her. Such a natural excuse never occurs\r\nto the Japanese servant, unless he be a _jinrikisha_ man or _bett[=o]_,\r\nwho may not know how to do better; for it is a very rude way of leaving\r\nservice. The high-minded maid will proceed very differently.\r\n\r\nA few days' leave of absence to visit home will be asked and usually\r\ngranted, for Japanese servants never have any settled time to take\r\nholiday. At the end of the given time the mistress will begin to wonder\r\nwhat has become of the girl, who has failed to return; and the lady will\r\nmake up her mind she will not let her go again so readily. Just when she\r\nhas a sharp reproof ready, a messenger or letter will arrive, with some\r\ngood excuse, couched in most polite and humble terms. Sometimes it will\r\nbe that she has found herself too weak for service, or that work at\r\nhome, or the illness of some member of the family, detains her, so that\r\nshe is not able to come back at present. The excuse is understood and\r\naccepted as final, and another servant is sought for and obtained. After\r\nseveral weeks have passed, very likely after entering a new place, the\r\nold servant will turn up some day, express her thanks for all past\r\nkindnesses and regrets at not returning in time, will take her pay and\r\nher bundles, and disappear forever.\r\n\r\nEven when servants come on trial for a few days, they often go away\r\nnominally to fetch their belongings, or make arrangements to return, but\r\nthe lady of the house does not know whether the woman is satisfied or\r\nnot. If she is not, her refusal is always brought by a third person. If\r\nthe mistress, on her side, does not wish to hire the girl, she will not\r\ntell her so to her face, but will send word at this time to prevent her\r\ncoming. Such is the etiquette in these matters of mistress and\r\nmaid.[*317]\r\n\r\nOnly by a multiplicity of details is it possible to give much idea of\r\nthe position of servants in a Japanese house, and even then the result\r\narrived at is that the positions of what we would call domestic\r\nservants vary so greatly in honor and responsibility that it is almost\r\nimpossible to draw any general conclusions upon this subject. We have\r\nseen that there is no distinct servile class in Japan, and that a\r\nperson's social status is not altered by the fact that he serves in a\r\nmenial capacity, provided that service be of one above him in rank and\r\nnot below him. This is largely the result of the grading of society upon\r\nother lines than those on which our social distinctions are founded, and\r\npartly the result of the fact that women, of whatever class, are\r\nservants so far as persons of the opposite sex in their own class are\r\nconcerned. The women of Japan to-day form the great servile class, and,\r\nas they are also the wives and mothers of those whom they serve, they\r\nare treated, of course, with a certain consideration and respect never\r\ngiven to a mere servant; and through them, all domestic service is\r\nelevated.[*318]\r\n\r\nThere are two employments which I have mentioned among those of domestic\r\nservants because they would be so classed by us, but which in Japan rank\r\namong the trades. The _jinrikisha_ man and the groom belong, as a rule,\r\nto a certain class at the bottom of the social ladder, and no samurai\r\nwould think of entering either of these occupations, except under stress\r\nof severest poverty. The _bett[=o]s_, or grooms, are a hereditary class\r\nand a regular guild, and have a reputation, among both Japanese and\r\nforeigners, as a betting, gambling, cheating, good-for-nothing lot. An\r\nhonest _bett[=o]_ is a rare phenomenon. The _jinrikisha_ men are, many\r\nof them, sons of peasants, who come to the cities for the sake of\r\nearning more money, or leading a livelier life than can be found in the\r\nlittle thatched cottage among the rice-fields. Few of them are married,\r\nor have homes of their own. Many of them drink and gamble, and sow their\r\nwild oats in all possible ways; but they are a well-meaning, fairly\r\nhonest, happy-go-lucky set, who lead hard lives of exhausting labor, and\r\nendure long hours of exposure to heat and cold, rain, snow, and blinding\r\nsunshine, not only with little complaint or grumbling, but with absolute\r\ncheerfulness and hilarity. A strong, fast _jinrikisha_ man takes great\r\npride in his strength and speed. It is a point of honor with him to pull\r\nhis passenger up the steepest and most slippery of hills, and never to\r\nheed him if he expresses a desire to walk in order to save his man. I\r\nhave had my _kurumaya_ stoutly refuse, again and again, my offers to\r\nwalk up a steep hill, even when the snow was so soft and slippery under\r\nhis bare feet that he fell three times in making the ascent. \"_Dai\r\njobu_\" (safe) would be his smiling response to all my protestations;\r\nand, once in a _jinrikisha_, the passenger is entirely at the mercy of\r\nhis man in all matters of getting into and out of the vehicle. But\r\nthough the _jinrikisha_ man is, for the time being, the autocrat and\r\ncontrolling power over his passenger, and though he will not obey the\r\nbehests of his employer, except so far as they seem reasonable and in\r\naccordance with the best interests of all concerned, he constitutes\r\nhimself the protector and assistant, the adviser and counselor, of him\r\nwhom he serves, and gives his best thought and intelligence, as well as\r\nhis speed and strength, to the service in which he is engaged. If he\r\nthinks it safe, he will tear like an unbroken colt through the business\r\nportions of the city, knocking bundles out of the hands of foot\r\npassengers, or even hitting the wayfarers themselves in a fierce dash\r\nthrough their midst, laughing gayly at their protests, and at threats of\r\nwrath to come from his helpless passenger; but should hint of insult or\r\ninjury against _kuruma_, passenger, or passenger's dog fall upon his\r\nears, he will drop the _jinrikisha_ shafts, and administer condign\r\npunishment to the offender, unchecked by thoughts of the ever-present\r\npolice, or by any terrors that his employer may hold over his head. In\r\nno other country in the world, perhaps, can a lady place more entire\r\nconfidence in the honor and loyalty of her servant than she can in Japan\r\nin her _kurumaya_, whether he be her private servant, or one from a\r\nrespectable stand. He may not do what she bids him, but that is quite a\r\nsecondary matter. He will study her interests; will remember her likes\r\nand dislikes; will take a mental inventory of the various accessories or\r\nbundles that she carries with her, and will never permit her to lose or\r\nforget one of them; will run his legs off in her service, and defend her\r\nand her property valiantly in case of need. Of course, as in all classes\r\nthere are different grades, so there are _jinrikisha_ men who seem to\r\nhave sunk so low in their calling that they have lost all feeling of\r\nloyalty to their employer, and only care selfishly for the pittance they\r\ngain. Such men are often found in the treaty ports, eagerly seeking for\r\nthe rich foreigner, from whom they can get an extra fee, and whom they\r\nregard as outside of their code of morals, and hence as their natural\r\nprey. Travelers, and even residents of Japan, have often complained of\r\nsuch treatment; and it is only after long stay in Japan, among the\r\nJapanese themselves, that one can tell what a _jinrikisha_ man is\r\ncapable of.[*322]\r\n\r\nIf you employ one _kurumaya_ for any length of time, you come to have a\r\nreal affection for him on account of his loyal, faithful, cheerful\r\nservice, such as we seldom find in this country except when inspired by\r\npersonal feeling. When you have ridden miles and miles, by night and by\r\nday, through rain and sleet and hottest sunshine, behind a man who has\r\nused every power of body and mind in your service, you cannot but have a\r\nstrong feeling of affection toward him, and of pride in him as well. It\r\nis something the feeling that one has for a good saddle-horse, but more\r\ndeveloped. You rejoice, not only in his strength and speed, put forth so\r\nwillingly in your service; in his picturesque, dark blue costume with\r\nyour monogram embroidered on the back; in his handsomely turned ankles;\r\nin his black, wavy hair; in his delicate hands and trim waist,--though\r\nthese are often a source of pride to you,--but his skill in divining\r\nyour wants; his use of his tongue in your service; his helping out of\r\nyour faltering Japanese with explanations which, if not elegant, have\r\nthe merit of being easily understood; his combats with extortionate\r\nshopkeepers in your behalf; his interest in all your doings and\r\nconcerns,--remain as a pleasant memory, upon your return to a land where\r\nno man would so far forget his manhood as to give himself so completely\r\nand without reserve to the service of any master save Mammon.\r\n\r\nAs old Japan, with its quaintness, its mediæval flavor, its feudalism,\r\nits loyalty, its sense of honor, and its transcendental contempt for\r\nmoney and luxury, recedes into the past, and as the memories of my life\r\nthere grow dim, two figures stand out more and more boldly from the\r\nfading background,--both, the figures of faithful servants. One, Yasaku,\r\nthe _kurumaya_, a very Hercules, who could keep close to a pair of coach\r\nhorses through miles of city streets, and who never suffered mortal\r\n_jinrikisha_ man to pass him. My champion in all times of danger and\r\nalarm, but a very autocrat in all minor matters,--his cheery face, his\r\nbroad shoulders with their blue draperies, his jolly, boyish voice, and\r\nhis dainty, delicate hands come before me as I write, and I wonder to\r\nwhat fortunate person he is now giving the intelligent service that he\r\nonce gave so whole-heartedly to me. The other, O Kaio, my maid, her\r\nplain little face, with its upturned eyes, growing, as the days went by,\r\nabsolutely beautiful in the light of pure goodness that beamed from it.\r\nA Japanese Christian, with all the Christian virtues well developed, she\r\nbecame to me not only a good servant, doing her work with conscientious\r\nfidelity, but a sympathetic friend, to whom I turned for help in time of\r\nneed; and whom I left, when I returned to America, with a sincere sorrow\r\nin my heart at parting with one who had grown to fill so large a place\r\nin my thoughts. Her little, half-shy, half-motherly ways toward her big\r\nforeign mistress had a charm all their own. Her pride and delight over\r\nmy progress in the language; her patient efforts to make me understand\r\nnew words, or to understand my uncouth foreign idioms; her joy, when at\r\nlast I reached the point where a story told by her lips could be\r\ncomprehended and enjoyed,--gave a continual encouragement in a task too\r\noften completely disheartening.\r\n\r\nDuring the last summer of my stay in Japan, cutting loose from all\r\nforeigners and foreign associations, I traveled alone with her through\r\nthe heart of the country, stopping only at Japanese hotels, and carrying\r\nwith me no supplies to eke out the simple Japanese fare. Through floods\r\nand typhoons we journeyed. Long days of scorching heat or driving rain\r\nin no way abated her cheerfulness, or lessened her desire to do all that\r\nshe could for my aid and comfort. Not one sad look nor impatient word\r\nshowed a flaw in her perfect temper; and if she privately made up her\r\nmind that I was crazy, she never by word or look gave a hint of her\r\nthought. _Jinrikisha_ men grumbled and gave out; hotel-keepers resented\r\nthe presence of my dog, or presented extortionate bills; but O Kaio's\r\ngood temper and tact never failed her. Difficulties were smoothed away;\r\nbills were compromised and reduced; the dog slept securely by my side on\r\na red blanket in the best rooms of the best hotels; and O Kaio smiled,\r\ntold her quaint stories, amused me and ministered to me, as if I were\r\nher one object in life, though husband and children were far away in\r\ndistant T[=o]ky[=o], and her mother's heart yearned for her little ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nWITHIN THE HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nInto the life of a Japanese home enter many customs and observances that\r\nhave not been dwelt upon in the preceding pages, but without some\r\nunderstanding of which our knowledge of the life of Japanese women is by\r\nno means complete. In Japan the woman's place is so entirely in the home\r\nthat all the ceremonies and superstitions that gather about the conduct\r\nof every-day affairs are more to her than they are to the freer and\r\nbroader-minded man. The household worship, the yearly round of\r\nfestivals, each with its special food to be prepared, the observances\r\nconnected with birth and marriage and death; what is to be done in time\r\nof illness, of earthquake, of fire, or of the frequent flittings that\r\nrender life in Japan one succession of packings and unpackings,--all\r\nthese are matters of high importance to the wife and mother, and their\r\nproper observance is left largely in her hands.\r\n\r\nEvery well-ordered Japanese home of the old-fashioned kind has its\r\nlittle shrine, which is the centre of the religious life of the house.\r\nIf the household is of the Shint[=o] faith, this shrine is called the\r\n_kami-dana_, or god shelf, and contains the symbols of the gods, _gohei_\r\nin vases, receptacles for food and drink, and a primitive lamp,--only a\r\nsaucer of oil in which a bit of pith serves for a wick. Daily offerings\r\nmust be made before this shrine, and reverence paid by the clapping of\r\nhands; while on feast days special offerings and invocations are\r\nrequired. In Buddhist families, the _Butsudan_, or Buddha shelf, takes\r\nthe place of the _kami-dana_, and the worship is slightly more\r\ncomplicated. Greater variety of food is offered, and the simple clapping\r\nof the hands and bowing of the head that is the form of prayer in the\r\nShint[=o] religion is replaced by the burning of incense and by actual\r\nverbal invocation of Buddha. These religious ceremonies must be\r\nattended to by the mother or wife. She it is who sets the rice and wine\r\nbefore the ancestral tablets, who lights the little lamp each night, and\r\nwho sees that at each feast day and anniversary season the proper food\r\nis prepared and set out for the household gods.\r\n\r\nUpon the wife, and her attention to minute and apparently trifling\r\ndetails, depends much of the well-being of the family. Each child, as it\r\ngrows toward maturity, gathers from various sources a collection of\r\namulets, which, while worn always when the child is in full dress, are\r\nfrequently too precious for ordinary play times and the risks and perils\r\nof every-day life. These must be kept carefully by the mother as a\r\nsafeguard against the many evils that beset child-life. I have spoken of\r\nthe amulets given at the times of the _miya mairi_,--both the first,\r\nwhen the name is given to the baby, and the subsequent visits made to\r\nthe temple by the children as they pass certain stated points in their\r\nprogress toward maturity. These amulets are simply written papers or\r\nslips of wood with the seal of the temple from which they are issued\r\nstamped upon them. Visits to noted temples by relatives and friends\r\noften result in additions to the child's collection. One kind of charm\r\nis good to keep the eyes strong; another will help its possessor to that\r\nmuch-prized accomplishment, a good handwriting; another acts as an\r\nassurance against accident and saves the child from harm in case of a\r\nfall. All these are put together by the careful mother and preserved as\r\njealously as Queen Althea kept the charred stick that governed the\r\ndestiny of her son. As the children arrive at years of discretion, these\r\ntreasures pass out of the mother's faithful keeping into the hands of\r\ntheir actual owners, and they are usually kept stored away in some\r\nlittle-used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any\r\nfurther safeguards over life. Perhaps of all the curious things that go\r\nto make up these intimate personal belongings of a Japanese man or\r\nwoman, there is none more curious than the small white parcel containing\r\na portion of the umbilical cord,--saved at birth and preserved until\r\ndeath that it may be buried with its possessor and furnish him the means\r\nof a new birth. These little paper packages, each marked with the name\r\nof the child to whom it belongs, are kept by the mother.\r\n\r\nUpon the mother of the family rests very largely the determining of\r\nlucky and unlucky days for the beginning or transaction of different\r\nkinds of business. A fortune-teller is consulted for important things,\r\nsuch as removals or marriages, but in every-day life one cannot be\r\nrunning to a fortune-teller about everything; and yet there is bad luck\r\nlurking in the background that may baffle all our plans if we do not\r\nobserve the proper times and seasons for our undertakings. Just as the\r\nJapanese calendar divides time into cycles of twelve years, each year\r\nnamed for a different animal, so also the days and hours are divided\r\ninto twelves and bear the names of the same twelve animals,--the Chinese\r\nsigns of the zodiac. These animals are as follows: the rat, the bull,\r\nthe tiger, the hare, the dragon, the snake, the horse, the goat, the\r\nmonkey, the cock, the dog, and the boar. Each animal brings its own\r\nkind of good or bad luck into the hour, day, or year over which it\r\npresides, and only a skillful balancer of pros and cons can read aright\r\nthe combinations, and understand what the luck of any particular hour in\r\nany particular day of any particular year will be. For instance, the\r\nrat, which is the companion of Daikoku, the money god, is a lucky animal\r\nso far as money is concerned. A person born in the year of the rat will\r\nnever need money, and will be economical, possibly miserly; and in one\r\nborn on the day of the rat in the year of the rat these chances and\r\nqualities will be doubled. But the luck of the rat may be very seriously\r\ninterfered with by the bad luck of the monkey or of the proverbially\r\nunlucky dog, when their days and hours occur in the rat year. On the\r\nother hand, their bad luck may be counteracted by the good luck of the\r\ntiger or hare, for as a rule three animals of different portent are\r\npresiding over human prospects every hour. This makes prophecy a\r\nticklish business, requiring a wise head, but it also leaves much room\r\nfor the subsequent explanation of failures by the superior and unusual\r\ninfluence of one or another of the animals, as the case may require.\r\nMomentous questions of this kind have frequently to be settled by the\r\nJapanese wife and mother, and she gains dignity and value in her home\r\nand neighborhood according to her skill in interpreting the portents of\r\nthe day and hour.\r\n\r\nFor the greater events of family life the home prophecies are felt to be\r\ntoo uncertain, and the services of the fortune-teller must be called in.\r\nNo well-managed family would think of building a new house without\r\nfinding in what direction to face the front door. In an American city\r\nthis necessity would cause considerable inconvenience, as the position\r\nof the front door is usually determined by the relation of the\r\nbuilding-lot to the street; but in a Japanese city, where, in all but\r\nthe business quarters, every house is concealed by a high board fence,\r\nand where the gate that admits one within the fence is the only sign by\r\nwhich any one in the street can judge of the worldly condition of the\r\ndwellers within, the houses are faced about any and every way, and the\r\nposition of each is determined by the good luck that it will bring its\r\nowner. After this matter has been settled and the house is fairly begun,\r\nthere are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends.\r\nOf these the most important is the day when the roof is raised. The roof\r\ntimbers, which are unsquared logs, often rather crooked, after being\r\ncarefully fitted and framed in some convenient vacant lot, are brought\r\non carts to the site of the new building, and when all is ready, the\r\nhead carpenter sends word to the house-owner that he is about to set the\r\nroof in place. The house-owner then decides whether the day set by the\r\nbuilder is a lucky one for himself and his family. If it is not, a delay\r\nin the building is always preferable to any danger of incurring the\r\ndispleasure of the luck gods. This crisis safely passed, and the last of\r\nthe roof beams secured in its place, the men take a holiday, and are\r\nfeasted on _saké_ and spaghetti by the house-owner. A present of money\r\nto each workman is also in order, and will conduce to the rapid and\r\nfaithful execution of the job in hand. When, at last, the house is\r\nfinished, and carpenters and plasterers are ready to leave it, the local\r\nfiremen, who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled\r\nlaborers, often ascend to the roof, and from the ridge-pole cast down\r\ncakes, for which the children of the neighborhood scramble joyfully.\r\n\r\nWhen the builders have left, and the house is ready for occupation, even\r\nto the soft, thick mats on the floor and the white paper windows, the\r\nfamily will move in on the first day thereafter that is both lucky and\r\npleasant. So far as possible, everything in the old house will be packed\r\nand ready the day before, and very early in the morning the relatives\r\nand friends of the mover will begin to rally around him. All come who\r\ncan, and those who cannot come send servants or provisions. Every\r\ntradesman or _kurumaya_ who has had or who hopes to have the patronage\r\nof the moving household sends a representative to help along the work,\r\nso that there is always a sufficient force to carry the household\r\nbelongings into the new home and settle them in place before the day is\r\nover. All these visiting helpers must be fed and provided with tea and\r\ncakes at proper intervals, and the presents of cooked food that pour in\r\nat such times are highly acceptable and of great practical usefulness.\r\nWhen the long day is ended and the visitors return one by one to their\r\nhomes, it is the mistress of the house who must see that every servant\r\nand representative of a business firm receives, neatly done up in white\r\npaper, a present of money properly proportioned to his services, and the\r\nstyle and circumstances of the family he has been aiding. And when all\r\nare gone, the shutters closed, and the family left alone in their new\r\nhome, the little wife must make a list of all who have helped in any way\r\nduring the day, and to all, within a short time, make some\r\nacknowledgment of their kindness by either a call or a present. It is\r\nupon the wife, too, that the duty falls of sending to each of the near\r\nneighbors _soba_, a kind of macaroni, as an announcement of the family's\r\narrival. The number of neighbors to whom this gift is sent is\r\ndetermined differently according to circumstances. If the house is one\r\nof several in a compound, _soba_ will be sent to all within the gate;\r\nbut if the compound is very large, so that the sending to all would be\r\ntoo great an expense, the five nearest houses will be selected to\r\nreceive the gift, or all who draw water from the same well. A very late\r\nfashion in T[=o]ky[=o], but one that is gaining ground because of its\r\nconvenience, is to send, not the macaroni itself, but an order on the\r\nnearest restaurant at which that delicacy is sold.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, much of a woman's time and thought must be given\r\nto the proper distribution of presents among friends and dependents. The\r\nsubject of what to give, when to give, to whom to give, and how to do up\r\nthe gift acceptably, is one the thorough understanding of which requires\r\nthe study of years. No foreigner can hope to do more than dabble in the\r\nshallows of it. Presents seem to be used more for the purpose of keeping\r\nthose persons whose services you may need, or whose enmity you dread,\r\nunder a sense of obligation, than they are as expressions of sentiment.\r\nEvery housekeeper, for instance, must need the occasional services of a\r\ncarpenter or a gardener, and in a large city like T[=o]ky[=o] the\r\nchances are that she will some day need, and need very badly, the\r\nservices of a fireman. A wise woman--one who is not penny wise and pound\r\nfoolish--will by timely presents keep herself constantly in the minds of\r\nsuch persons, so that when she sends for them, they may feel under\r\nsufficient obligation to her to come at once. So will her house be\r\nquickly put in repair after earthquake or other accident; her garden\r\nshow for only the briefest interval the ravages of the typhoon which has\r\ngullied out her lawn and leveled her choicest trees; and when some night\r\n\"the flower of Yedo\" blooms suddenly by her side, she will have the\r\nspeedy assistance of the firemen, who will seal her storehouse securely\r\nwith clay, wet her roof and walls thoroughly with water, and light at\r\nher gates the great alarm lanterns to tell her friends that her house is\r\nin danger and summon them to her assistance. No friend can disregard\r\nsuch a signal, but all will rally round her once more to help in this\r\nless orderly and cheerful moving,--will pack and cord and carry out her\r\ngoods, and if at last the fire consumes her dwelling, will gather her\r\nhousehold and belongings into their hospitable homes. But the foolish\r\nwoman, who neglects or forgets her dependents when she does not need\r\nthem, finds some day that her roof is leaking, but all the carpenters\r\nare too busy to mend it, her garden is destroyed because the gardener\r\nhad an important engagement elsewhere just when she needed him, and her\r\nproperty is burned up or ruined by water and smoke because the firemen\r\nattended to her house last when the fire swept over her compound.\r\n\r\nWhen death enters a house in Japan, there are no undertakers to relieve\r\nthe family of the painful duty of caring for the dead body and placing\r\nit in the coffin. There are coffin-makers and funeral managers who\r\nsupply the great white bier and lanterns and the bunches of paper\r\nflowers that adorn every funeral procession, but within the house the\r\npreparations are all made by the family and friends, and the heaviest\r\nand most painful part of the work falls, as usual, on the women of the\r\nfamily. As soon as the breath finally leaves the body, it is wrapped in\r\na quilt, laid with its head to the north, and an inverted screen placed\r\naround it. On one corner of the screen is hung a sword or knife to keep\r\noff any evil spirit that may wander into the room in the shape of a cat\r\nand disturb the dead.\r\n\r\nEtiquette requires that relatives and intimate friends of the family\r\ncall immediately on learning of the death. To receive these calls the\r\nmourners, in full ceremonial dress, must sit in the death chamber and\r\nremove for each guest the covering from the face of the dead. The\r\nvisitors then offer the ceremonial bows to the corpse, as if it were\r\nalive. During this time, too, presents to the spirit of the dead are\r\npouring in. The proper offerings are flowers, cake, vegetables, candles,\r\nincense, or small gifts of money for the purchase of incense. If the\r\ndeceased is a person of rank or distinction, the house is flooded with\r\ncumbersome and useless offerings. This custom has become so great an\r\naddition to the trials necessarily incident to a bereavement that one\r\noccasionally sees in the newspaper announcements of deaths a request\r\nthat no offerings to the dead be sent.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the death, often in the evening, the body must be\r\nplaced in the cask-shaped coffin that until recently was the style\r\ncommonly in use in Japan. Now, among the wealthier classes, the long\r\ncoffin has superseded the small square or round one, but the smaller\r\nexpense connected with burial in the old way makes the survival of the\r\nold type a necessity for the majority of Japanese. At an appointed time\r\nall the relatives assemble in the death chamber, and preparations are\r\nmade for the bathing of the corpse. Two of the _tatami_, or floor mats,\r\nare turned over, and upon them are placed a new tub, a new pail, and a\r\nnew dipper. These utensils must have no metal of any kind about them. In\r\nthe washing of the body none but members of the family must assist, and\r\nrespect for the dead absolutely requires that all the relatives of the\r\ndeceased who are below him in rank must have a hand in these final\r\nablutions. In Japan, the mourning for the dead is the duty of inferiors,\r\nnever of superiors. There is no official, ceremonial mourning of parents\r\nfor their children, nor does custom require them to perform any of the\r\nlast rites, or attend the funeral. Upon the younger brothers and sisters\r\nfalls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations. If the\r\nwife dies, her husband does not mourn for her, though her children do;\r\nbut if the husband dies, the wife must mourn the rest of her life,\r\ncutting off her hair and placing it in the coffin as a sign of her\r\nperpetual faithfulness.\r\n\r\nWhen the body has been washed, it is dressed in white, in silk _habutai_\r\nwhenever the family can afford it. The dress, which must be appropriate\r\nto the season, in the making of which all the women of the family must\r\nassist, is the plain, straight kimono, but must be folded from right to\r\nleft, instead of from left to right as in life. The body, to be placed\r\nin the coffin, must be folded into a sitting posture, the chin resting\r\nupon the knees,--the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal\r\nAmerican tombs. This difficult, to us apparently impossible feat, safely\r\naccomplished, there are placed in the coffin a number of small things\r\nthat the dead takes with him to the next world. Some of these have been\r\nalready mentioned, the others are little keepsakes, or perhaps tokens of\r\nthe tastes and employments of the dead,--dice, cards, _saké_ bottles,\r\nthe image of a horse, toy weapons,--anything, provided only that it be\r\nnot of metal, may be used for this purpose. The single exception to this\r\nrule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in, to fee the\r\nold hag who guards the bank of the river of death. Last of all, the\r\nvacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea. Then the\r\ncoffin is closed and nailed up, wrapped with a white silk cloth fastened\r\nwith a white silk or cotton cord, and placed on a high stand, and food\r\nand incense are placed before it.\r\n\r\nSo long as the coffin is in the house, it must be watched over\r\ncontinually. To aid in this protracted vigil, which must be kept up day\r\nand night until the burial, the relatives, friends, and retainers of the\r\ndead assemble at the house in large numbers. In the case of a person of\r\nwealth and influence, there will often be a hundred or more of these\r\nwatchers, who must be fed and cared for; and who take turns in watching,\r\neating, and sleeping. It is their duty to see that the incense burning\r\nbefore the coffin is never allowed to go out, while the food for the\r\ndead is renewed at regular intervals by the mourners themselves.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat detailed description of the duties to be performed by the\r\nmembers of a bereaved family in the house of mourning is sufficient to\r\nshow that the presence of death in the home is made as terrible as\r\npossible by the painful ceremonies, the continual bustle and excitement,\r\nand the strain upon the resources and executive ability of the\r\nhousekeeper and her assistants. There are few enlightened Japanese who\r\nwill defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted, or who do\r\nnot long for some change, but so great is the force of conservatism in\r\nthis regard, so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack\r\nof respect for the dead, that reform advances slowly.\r\n\r\nIndividual instances occur in which some of the worst features of these\r\ncustoms are modified. A case in point is that of the late Mr. Fukuzawa,\r\na man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in\r\nmodern ways, and who in his death continued his teaching. In his will he\r\nprovided that his body was to be buried, without washing, in the\r\nclothing in which he died. This provision would seem in most countries\r\nto be mere eccentricity, but when one has seen or heard of the gruesome\r\nceremony that follows immediately after death, and the burden of which\r\nfalls, not on the old and hardened, but on the young and tender,\r\nsuffering, in many cases, under the weight of a first and crushing\r\naffliction, one can see that only through such means as this can the\r\nburden ever be lifted from the shoulders of those who mourn. There are\r\nyoung and enlightened mothers in Japan to-day who have felt, in minds\r\nawakened to thought and action, the horrors of the system, and who will\r\nnot allow their children to suffer for them what they have suffered in\r\npaying respect to their dead parents. Through this growing feeling and\r\nthe unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release\r\nfrom these mournful ceremonies.\r\n\r\nWhile the body remains in the house, a priest comes from time to time to\r\noffer prayers, longer or shorter according to the wealth of the family\r\nemploying him; and when the funeral cortège sets out on its way to the\r\ncemetery, the priests in their professional robes form an imposing part\r\nof the spectacle. The day of the burial is selected with due respect to\r\nthe calendar, for, though there may be little good luck about a funeral,\r\nthere is a chance of extremely bad luck growing out of it unless every\r\nprecaution is taken. Just before the procession starts, a religious\r\nceremony is held at the house, which is attended by the friends of the\r\ndeceased, and which is substantially the same as that performed at the\r\ncemetery. On the day of the burial, great bunches of natural flowers are\r\nsent to the dead, each bunch so large as to require the services of one\r\nman to carry it. Sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in\r\nthe procession, but if the giver feels too poor to hire a man, this\r\nburden, too, falls upon the bereaved household, for etiquette requires\r\nthat all flowers sent be borne to the grave by uniformed coolies, who\r\nmarch in the funeral train. Another favorite present at this time, among\r\nBuddhists, is a cage of living birds, to be borne to the grave and\r\nreleased thereon. This act of mercy is counted to the deceased for\r\nrighteousness, and is believed to aid in rendering his next incarnation\r\na happy one.\r\n\r\nA funeral procession is an imposing spectacle, and, to the uninstructed\r\nforeigner, a cheerful one; for there is nothing sad or sombre in the\r\nwhite, or bright-colored, robes of the priests, the white,\r\ntinsel-decorated bier, the red and white flags borne aloft, the enormous\r\nbunches of gay-colored flowers;--the very mourners in white silk, and\r\nwith faces apparently unmoved by grief, bring no thought of the object\r\nof the procession to the Western mind. It seems more like a bridal than\r\na burial. But if you follow the cortège to the cemetery and there\r\nlisten to the wailing of the wind instruments, and the droning of the\r\npriests as they perform the last rites, and watch the silent company\r\nthat one by one go forward to bow before the coffin and place upon it a\r\nbranch of _sakaki_ or burn a bit of incense, the trappings of woe in\r\nJapan will impress themselves strongly upon your mind, and the gayly\r\nappareled funeral processions will seem to you ever afterward as\r\nmournful and hopeless a spectacle as you can find in any country.\r\n\r\nThe house of death remains a place of mourning for forty-nine days after\r\nthe funeral. During this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed\r\nto be still inhabiting the house, and a tablet or shrine is set up in\r\nthe death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily.\r\nVisitors are expected to make obeisance to the dead. At the end of this\r\ntime, some acknowledgment must be sent to every friend who has sent\r\nanything to the house at the funeral. For a time after death has come\r\ninto the family the relatives of the dead are regarded as ceremonially\r\nunclean. The period of defilement varies with the nearness of\r\nrelationship. In the old days, no one thus defiled was allowed to go\r\nabout his regular business or to mingle with other men; but busy modern\r\nJapan does not find it convenient to pause long in its work, so that\r\ngovernment officials and school-children are now sent written papers\r\nexcusing them for coming back to their tasks even while ceremonially\r\nunclean. Thus the old custom is passing away. In the first year after\r\ndeath, certain days are observed with special honors before the memorial\r\ntablet, and later, certain anniversaries of the death must be kept,\r\nuntil, at last, at the end of fifty or one hundred years, the\r\npersonality of the spirit seems to become merged with that of the other\r\nancestral spirits, and no offerings are made to it except at the general\r\nfeasts of the dead.\r\n\r\nWith the coming in of the last month of the year begin the preparations\r\nfor the great New Year's festival, and the housekeeper finds herself\r\noccupied through every moment of the brief days. A woman who is at the\r\nhead of a large household has upon her hands in the month of December\r\nspring house-cleaning and preparations for Christmas, New Year's,\r\nThanksgiving, and Easter, all at once. The work of getting the family\r\nwardrobe ready for the festival must begin very early in the month, for\r\nevery man, woman, and child in the household must be provided with new\r\nclothes, and the thrifty housewife sends no sewing out. In the old days,\r\nit was ordained that the eighth day of the twelfth month should be a\r\nneedle festival,--a day on which all women rest from their sewing and\r\namuse themselves by indulging their own fancies instead of their\r\nhusbands', as is their duty on other days. This day was supposed to mark\r\nthe dividing line between the old year's and the new year's sewing, but,\r\nas a matter of fact, the forehanded woman will finish up the old and\r\nbegin the new even earlier in the month, so as to have this part of her\r\nwork well out of the way before the house-cleaning, which should be\r\nbegun not later than the fifteenth.\r\n\r\nThis house-cleaning, even with the small amount of furniture found in a\r\nJapanese house, is an elaborate affair. Every box and closet and\r\nrubbish-hole in the house is turned out and put in order, the _tatami_\r\nare taken up and brushed and beaten, the woodwork from ceiling to floor\r\nis carefully washed, the plaster and paper walls flicked with the paper\r\nflapper that takes the place in Japan of our feather duster. All the\r\nquilts and clothing must be sunned and aired, the kakémonos and curios\r\nbelonging to the family unpacked, carefully dusted, and put back into\r\ntheir wrappings and boxes, and the house and garden put into perfect\r\nrepair. This work, if thoroughly done, takes about a week. When all is\r\nfinished, even to the final purification by beating everything in the\r\nhouse with a fresh bamboo, games and festivities and _soba_ are in\r\norder. In the old daimi[=o] houses, where great numbers of men and women\r\nwere employed, and where the women's quarters were in a distinct part of\r\nthe house, it was considered a great joke to catch a man on the women's\r\nside any time between the close of the cleaning and the beginning of the\r\nnew year. The intruder was promptly seized and shouldered by the women,\r\nwho carried him about the house in triumph, finally returning him to his\r\nown quarters. If, by any chance, they could catch the chief steward,\r\nthey sang as they carried him about:--\r\n\r\n    \"This is the great pillar of the house!\r\n     May he be happy till the stone foundations rot!\"\r\n\r\nThe week following the house-cleaning is devoted to the preparation of\r\nfood for the festival. Of this, the most characteristic is _mochi_, a\r\nsort of dumpling made of rice steamed and pounded, the preparation of\r\nwhich is so difficult and protracted a process that it is not lightly\r\nundertaken. It is so distinctively the festival food of Japan that if\r\nyou find _mochi_ in a friend's house at any time except the new year,\r\nyou immediately ask what has happened, and are pretty sure to be told\r\nthat it is a present received in celebration of a birth or a marriage,\r\nor some other domestic festival. It is, to Japanese children, what\r\nturkey and cranberry sauce are to American children, not only a delight\r\nto the palate, but a dish the very smell of which brings back the most\r\ncheerful occasions in the year.\r\n\r\nWhen the _mochi_ is made and set away to await the festal day, the\r\nmatter of decoration must be attended to. At every gate is erected some\r\ntoken of the season, if it be only a bit of pine stuck into the ground,\r\nor a wisp of straw rope decorated with white paper _gohei_. The great\r\nblack gates that indicate the homes of the wealthier classes are almost\r\nconcealed by structures of pine and bamboo, on which oranges, lobsters,\r\nstraw rope, straw fringe, white paper, and images of the good luck gods\r\nare used as decorations. All these things are either efficacious in\r\nkeeping off evil spirits, or are symbols of good luck. Within the house,\r\nin the _tokonoma_, or place of honor, in the best room, great cakes of\r\n_mochi_, two, three, five, or seven in number, are set one upon another\r\nin a dish covered with fern leaves, and the structure surrounded by\r\nseaweed.\r\n\r\nBefore the new year comes in the capable housewife will have sent out\r\npresents to every one who has during the year been of service to her\r\nhusband, her children, or herself in any way. Her own servants will be\r\nremembered with gifts of clothing, something will be sent to the\r\nservants of friends at whose houses any of the family have visited\r\noften, and every dependent, poor relation, employee, and employee's\r\nchild must be given a present, large or small, according to the amount\r\nof obligation felt by the giver. To persons of greater wealth and\r\nimportance, to whom the family are grateful for past favors or from whom\r\nthey are hoping for something in the future, gifts, often quite out of\r\nproportion to the resources of the givers, are sent,--a method of\r\ninvesting capital that is a little risky, though it sometimes yields\r\nprompt and bountiful returns. On the other hand, all the merchants and\r\nmarketmen who supply the house send presents to the mistress and\r\nfrequently to the head servants as well, and _furushiki_ (bundle\r\nhandkerchiefs), cooking utensils, packages of sugar, boxes of eggs,\r\ndried fish, etc., flow in at the kitchen; while crêpe, silk, cotton\r\ncloth, money, toys, curios, and other valuables flow out of the parlor.\r\nAll this present-giving is a severe tax upon the strength and resources\r\nof the housekeeper, and adds heavily to the burden that the last month\r\nof the year imposes upon her.\r\n\r\nBy the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth of the month the trades-people begin\r\nto send in their bills, for every man expects to square up all his\r\naccounts by the last night of the old year, and early payments are\r\nexpected and made, so that all may begin the new year out of debt. So\r\nuniversal is this custom that the man who finds at the eleventh hour\r\nthat he cannot clear off all his debts is likely to offer his property\r\nat a heavy sacrifice in order to secure the necessary cash. For any one\r\nwith ready money extraordinary bargains are to be met with in Japanese\r\nshops during the last week of the year. In case this resource fails,\r\nsuicide is still a short and honorable way out of a world that has\r\nbecome too difficult to live in.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese housewife must feel, when December has been successfully\r\npassed, like the Yankee who had noticed that if he lived through the\r\nmonth of March he generally lived through the rest of the year. The\r\nobservances of January, for which December has been one long\r\npreparation, begin with the rising of the New Year's sun, and continue\r\nin one form or another for about two weeks. Almost every day has its\r\nspecial food and its special festival duty. For the first three days the\r\nvery best clothes in the wardrobe are worn by everybody, then till the\r\nseventh the second best, and from the seventh to the end of the month\r\nnew clothes, though not the very best, must be worn. Within the first\r\nseven days every man in Japan is expected to call on all his friends and\r\nacquaintances, but the women, probably out of consideration for the many\r\nduties that the festival season puts upon them, are given until March to\r\nfinish up their New Year's calls.\r\n\r\nThe streets of the cities, and even of the small villages, are full of\r\nlife and interest for a week or two. _Kurumayas_ in their new winter\r\nliveries trundle around fathers and mothers and happy children. All\r\nmanner of mummers, musicians, and dancers go from house to house in\r\nsearch of custom. The _manzai_, who, with dances and songs and strange\r\ngrimaces, undertake to drive out from your house for the new year all\r\nthe devils who may have been residing there hitherto, are a special\r\nfeature of this season. In every garden and in the public streets little\r\ngirls, their faces freshly covered with white paint, their shining black\r\nhair newly dressed, their wing-sleeved kimonos gorgeous with many\r\ncolors, play battledore and shuttlecock, toss small bags half filled\r\nwith rice, or pat balls wound with shining silk to the accompaniment of\r\na weird little chant. For the boys there are kites of many shapes and\r\ncolors, or tops that they spin under every one's feet, well knowing that\r\nno one in Japan is too busy to turn aside for a child's pleasure. The\r\nvery horses--small, shock-headed, evil-tempered beasts, who drag\r\ntremendous loads with many snorts and snaps at their masters--are decked\r\nout with gay streamers that reach nearly to the ground, at the ends of\r\nwhich are tinkling bells. The festival season closes on the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth with a visit to the temple of Yemma, the god of hell, and\r\nwith a holiday for all the apprentices.\r\n\r\nNext to the New Year's holiday, perhaps the most important festival of\r\nthe Japanese year is _O Bon_, the Feast of the Dead. This is, in its\r\npresent form, a Buddhist institution, but in spirit it fitted so exactly\r\ninto the ancient Japanese ideas of the tastes and habits of departed\r\nspirits that it merely supplanted the old Shint[=o] feasts of the dead,\r\nand it is a little difficult to-day to determine whether its observance\r\nis more Buddhist or Shint[=o] in its character. To find the O Bon\r\nceremonies in their most perfect form, it is necessary now to go into\r\nthe more remote country villages, for though, even in T[=o]ky[=o], this\r\nfeast is still one of the most important in the whole year, it seems to\r\nbe more distinctly itself in a small village, where all the old forms\r\nare still kept up.\r\n\r\nIn T[=o]ky[=o], the three days' festival is kept by the new calendar, and\r\noccurs on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth of July. At O Bon, as\r\nat New Year's time, it is customary to square off all obligations by a\r\ngeneral giving of presents. This, while not quite as important a matter\r\nas at the beginning of the year, is still a severe tax upon the time,\r\npurse, and memory of the wife and mother in any large family. At this\r\ntime, too, as at New Year's, _mochi_ or some other festival dish must be\r\nprovided, but at this point the resemblance between the two occasions\r\nceases. In accordance with its character as a feast of departed spirits,\r\nthe observance of O Bon is distinctively religious. On the twelfth, the\r\nfamily go to the graveyard and clean and put in order the graves and\r\ntombstones, so that the returning spirits may find all properly cared\r\nfor. Fresh water and flowers are placed before each stone, and sometimes\r\nrice and fresh vegetables. At home, the ancestral tablets in the\r\n_Butsudan_ form the centre of the ceremonies. Before the shrine are\r\nplaced, on the thirteenth, offerings of food of any kind that can be\r\nmade without fish or meat. Great balls of _mochi_, _saké_, flowers, and\r\nchoice new varieties of vegetables are appropriate offerings. All are\r\ntastefully arranged, the lamps are carefully lighted every night, and\r\nspecial services are held before the shrine. For the three days of the\r\nfeast, the souls of the dead are believed to be visiting their old\r\nhaunts, and to need light and food and all the conveniences that their\r\ndescendants can spare them. Each house is decorated with lanterns, that\r\nthe spirits may be able to find their way. It is from this custom that\r\nthe feast is often called by foreigners the Feast of Lanterns.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, in T[=o]ky[=o] and other modernized places, this\r\nfeast is not seen at its best. Only the soft glow of the lanterns\r\nswinging from every house, and the decorations in the graveyards and at\r\nthe household shrines, indicate to the traveler that anything unusual is\r\ngoing on. But in the country regions it is quite another matter, and the\r\nwelcoming, entertainment, and proper dismissal of the visiting spirits\r\nform the entire business of the community for three days. Usually the\r\nmiddle of August is the time for the country celebration. On the\r\ntwelfth, bands of children carrying red lanterns march singing through\r\nthe village on their way to the graveyard, where the annual cleaning is\r\ntaking place. That night bonfires in the cemetery and before the houses\r\nlight the pathway of the wanderers. Then for three nights all the young\r\npeople of the village gather in the temple court in grotesque disguises\r\nand with towels over their faces, and dance all night long in the\r\nmoonlight, to primitive music produced by a drum and the monotonous\r\nchant of the dancers themselves. These three dance-nights are the great\r\noccasion of the year to the young peasants, for this is the only time\r\nwhen persons of both sexes meet together in a social way, and it is long\r\nlooked forward to and enjoyed intensely. Of late years, the government,\r\nfearing the abuses that grow out of this exceptional social event, has\r\nendeavored to suppress the dancing, but it continues in full vigor\r\nthroughout most of rural Japan, though conducted with more decorum than\r\nformerly on account of the standing dread of police interference. The\r\nobject of the dance is to amuse the spirits of the ancestors, who must\r\nbe imagined as hovering in the background, viewing with approval the\r\nantics of their descendants.\r\n\r\nOther amusements are going on in the village on the O Bon evenings. At\r\na summer resort every hotel-keeper will have a professional\r\nstory-teller, a company of musicians, or some other entertainment to\r\nwhich the guests of the hotel are invited, and at which as many of the\r\nvillagers as can crowd to the open house fronts stare until the dance\r\ndrum in the temple court draws their feet in that direction. And then,\r\non the last night of the feast, bonfires are once more kindled at every\r\nhouse, so that the spirits may find their way safely back to the land\r\nwhence they came, and not stay to haunt their descendants at improper\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nNo account of life in a Japanese home would be complete without a little\r\nspace devoted to the special delights of the small boy. Although this\r\nbook deals mainly with feminine concerns, the small boy in Japan, as in\r\nAmerica, is the life and fun of the home, and one cannot fail to notice\r\nhis times of surpassing enjoyment. He rules the house and his mother and\r\nhis grandmother and his sisters, at all times, and his activity and\r\nenterprise secure for him a good share in any fun that is going on; but\r\nthere are certain seasons that appeal to the boyish heart with a special\r\nmessage and of which he is the central figure.\r\n\r\nAs the Feast of Dolls is to the girls, so is the Feast of Flags to the\r\nboys,--their own special day, set apart for them out of the whole year.\r\nIt comes on the fifth day of the fifth month (now May fifth), and for\r\nlong before its arrival the shops are gay with all manner of tempting\r\ntoys, while in every yard rises a great bamboo pole, from which, when\r\nthe time comes, will float an enormous carp, its body inflated by the\r\nstrong spring wind, its great mouth wide open, and its eyes glaring\r\nhideously, as it fights its way against the air currents. Sometimes\r\nthere will be half a dozen such poles in one yard,--signs either that\r\nthe household is blessed with many boys, or that the way to its heart is\r\nthrough gifts of toys to its son and heir. When the great day at last\r\narrives, the feast within the home is conducted in much the same way as\r\nthe Feast of Dolls. There are the same red-covered shelves, the same\r\nofferings of food and drink; but instead of the placid images of the\r\nEmperor and Empress and the five court musicians, the household\r\nfurnishings and toilet articles, there are effigies of the heroes of\r\nhistory and folklore: Jingo, the warrior Empress; Takenouchi, her\r\nwhite-haired prime minister, holding in his arms her son, the infant\r\nwar-god; Benkei, the giant retainer of Yoshitsune; Yoshitsune himself,\r\nthe marvelous fencer and general; Kintaro, the fat, hairy, red boy, who\r\nwas born and grew up in the mountains, and even in his babyhood fought\r\nwith bears; Shoki Sama, the strong man who could conquer _oni_;--these\r\nare some of the characters to be found on the shelves at the boys'\r\nfeast. Behind each figure stands a flag with the crest of the hero that\r\nit represents, and before them are set all manner of weapons in\r\nminiature. The food offered is _mochi_ wrapped in oak leaves, because\r\nthe oak is among trees what the carp is among fishes, the emblem of\r\nstrength and endurance. The flower of this day is the iris or flag,\r\nbecause of its sword-shaped leaves,--hence the name, _Shobu Matsuri_,\r\nfeast of iris or flag.\r\n\r\nAnother feast, which, while not founded for the boys, seems to have\r\nbeen adopted by them as a great occasion, is what is known as Buddha's\r\nbirthday, celebrated on April eighth. On this day in every Buddhist\r\ntemple a temporary platform is erected, the roof of which is covered\r\nwith flowers. Upon this platform, in a great tub filled with licorice\r\ntea, is set a small image of the infant Buddha. Hither flock the small\r\nboys with bamboo dippers, and spend the day ladling up the tea and\r\npouring it over the image, and then ladling it out into small bamboo\r\nbuckets. This licorice tea, through contact with the image, acquires\r\nmiraculous healing properties, and the devout, after making offerings of\r\nmoney twisted up in white paper, carry away the little buckets. The tea\r\nis good for the eyes and the throat, and if some of it be used in mixing\r\nink, and then, with the ink thus mixed, a charm be written and placed\r\nabout the house, it will keep away all vermin. It is not easy to see\r\nexactly what the fascination of this feast is to the boys, but I am told\r\nthat many of them like it even better than their own specially\r\nappointed day.\r\n\r\nBut of all the delights that come into the year, there is nothing to\r\ncompare for joyous excitement with the great _matsuri_ of the parish\r\ntemple. For at least a week beforehand there are enough interesting\r\nthings going on in every house and shop along the street to keep every\r\nsmall boy in the parish agog from morning till night. Here are lanterns\r\nbeing made with the _mon_ of the gods on one side and the rising sun of\r\nthe Japanese flag on the other. There a dancing platform is being\r\nerected, and at every stage of its development it is swarming with\r\nactive youngsters, who shin up its poles, turn somersaults on the\r\nplatform, and sit in rows on its edge, with bare legs swinging high over\r\nthe heads of the passers-by; and when it is done, and the drums\r\ninstalled, they take turns all day and far into the night in keeping\r\nthem going. Then, too, there are the _dashi_, or floats, on one of which\r\neach street in the parish spends its money and its ingenuity. How the\r\nboys haunt the shops in which they are being made! How they watch the\r\nwondrous changes of paper into flowers, and of bamboo and cotton cloth\r\ninto sea waves, or castle walls, or monsters of earth or sea or air! How\r\nthey chatter and wriggle and push and squirm for front places, when at\r\nlast the great cars are built up in the open street, the marvelous\r\nedifices erected upon them, and at the top of all the heroic figures of\r\nwell-known mythological or historical characters rise majestic in\r\nflowing robes! Then, when the black bullocks, resplendent in collars and\r\nhalters of red rope, are yoked to the triumphal car, and the structure\r\nmoves slowly down the shouting street, how the boys crawl into every\r\njoint and cranny of the _dashi_, how they hang from every beam, how they\r\nyell from before and behind in sheer abandon of joy! And at last, when\r\nthe procession forms, and with fantastically garbed men marching in\r\nfront and wild-eyed singers yelling just behind them, with dancing-girls\r\non moving platforms and jugglers and tumblers on the _dashi_ themselves,\r\nthe twenty or more festal cars move, with frequent stops, down to the\r\ntemple, to escort the sacred symbols on their annual pilgrimage through\r\nthe parish, who so noisy or so ubiquitous as these same bullet-headed,\r\nblue-gowned boys? They bob up at every turn, ooze out at every pore of\r\nthe procession, and enjoy, as only boys can enjoy, the noise and\r\nconfusion, the barbaric splendor, the dancing and tumbling, the mumming\r\nand drumming, the excruciating howls of the singers, the jingling of the\r\nmarshals' iron-ringed staves, the clapping of the great wooden clappers\r\nthat time the movement and the stops of the pageant.\r\n\r\nBetter than all, perhaps, is the evening, when the streets, lighted by\r\nmany lanterns, are filled with throngs of holiday-makers,--now stopping\r\nto stare in at some shop where the devout worshiper has established a\r\nbeautiful shrine, has set out _mochi_ and other offerings before some\r\nimage, or has arranged a landscape garden in a box, or constructed a\r\n_matsuri_ procession just entering the court of a miniature temple; now\r\nhaggling with the ever-present booth-keepers for lanterns or cakes or\r\nhairpins to take back to the friends left at home. Suddenly there is a\r\njoyous, rhythmic shout of many excited boyish voices, there is a\r\ngleaming of square red lanterns, a whirl and a rush through the crowd.\r\nNow is the time to get out of the way, for the boys move quickly and are\r\ntoo excited to turn aside for anything. On they come at a sharp trot,\r\neach little round head bound about with a fillet of blue and white\r\ntoweling, each lithe, active body more or less covered by a blue and\r\nwhite gown, all shouting in unison and bearing on their shoulders a\r\nminiature _dashi_, made most often of a _saké_ tub mounted on a frame,\r\nand decorated with lanterns and white paper. They charge through the\r\ncrowd, which makes way quickly at their approach, until the pace, the\r\nweight of their burden, and the frantic shouting exhaust their breath.\r\nThen they plunge down a side street, rest for a few moments, gather\r\nthemselves together, and charge once more into the crowd. There must be\r\nsome pretty tired little boys in the parish when the fun is all over,\r\nfor these performances are kept up far into the night; but for absolute\r\nand perfect enjoyment there is nothing I have yet seen that seems to me\r\nto compare with the enjoyment that a Japanese boy gets out of a\r\n_matsuri_. It is worth being tired for!\r\n\r\nThere is no space in this work for a more detailed picture of life in a\r\nJapanese home. Enough has been said in this chapter to show that it is\r\nmade up of many little things,--of cares and sorrows and\r\npleasures,--just as is life in any American home, and it is the little\r\nthings we care about that make the oneness of the family, and the\r\nnation, and the oneness, too, of humanity, if we can only understand one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTEN YEARS OF PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman question in Japan is at the present moment a matter of much\r\nconsideration. There seems to be an uneasy feeling in the minds of even\r\nthe more conservative men that some change in the status of woman is\r\ninevitable, if the nation wishes to keep the pace it has set for itself.\r\nThe Japanese women of the past and of the present are exactly suited to\r\nthe position accorded them in society, and any attempt to alter them\r\nwithout changing their status only results in making square pegs for\r\nround holes. If the pegs hereafter are to be cut square, the holes must\r\nbe enlarged and squared to fit them. The Japanese woman stands in no\r\nneed of alteration unless her place in life is somehow enlarged, nor, on\r\nthe other hand, can she fill a larger place without additional\r\ntraining. The men of New Japan, to whom the opinions and customs of the\r\nWestern world are becoming daily more familiar, while they shrink\r\naghast, in many cases, at the thought that their women may ever become\r\nlike the forward, self-assertive, half-masculine women of the West, show\r\na growing tendency to dissatisfaction with the smallness and narrowness\r\nof the lives of their wives and daughters,--a growing belief that better\r\neducated women would make better homes, and that the ideal home of\r\nEurope and America is the product of a more advanced civilization than\r\nthat of Japan. Reluctantly in many cases, but still almost universally,\r\nit is admitted that in the interest of the homes and for the sake of\r\nfuture generations, something must be done to carry the women forward\r\ninto a position more in harmony with what the nation is reaching for in\r\nother directions. This desire shows itself in individual efforts to\r\nimprove by more advanced education daughters of exceptional promise, and\r\nin general efforts for the improvement of the condition of women.\r\nWell-to-do fathers are willing to spend more money on the education of\r\ntheir daughters, to send them abroad, if possible, to complete their\r\nstudies, or to postpone the time of marriage so that plans for higher\r\neducation may be carried through. Where, ten years ago, the number of\r\nwomen who had been abroad for study might be counted on the fingers of\r\none hand, there are now three or four times that number in T[=o]ky[=o]\r\nalone. Another sign of the times is the fact that husbands going abroad\r\non business or for pleasure are more inclined to take their wives with\r\nthem, even if it be only for a few months. There are now to be found, in\r\nall the larger cities, women who have spent a longer or shorter time in\r\nsome foreign country, whose minds have been opened and whose horizons\r\nhave been enlarged by contact with new ideas. All this cannot fail to\r\nhave its effect, sooner or later, upon the country at large.\r\n\r\nThe efforts for the improvement of women in general may be grouped into\r\nfour classes: by legislation, by education, through the press, and by\r\nmeans of societies for mutual improvement.\r\n\r\nOf the recent legislation concerning marriage and divorce and its\r\neffect on the family, I have spoken in a preceding chapter. The latest\r\nstatistics show that, while before the new laws were enacted divorces\r\nwere one to every three marriages, they have now been reduced to one in\r\nfive. It must be said, however, that the law is still somewhat in\r\nadvance of public opinion. While the chance of permanence in marriage is\r\nbetter now than it was before the new code came into force, custom is\r\nstill stronger than the law, and marriage is too often a temporary\r\narrangement. In many cases the wife knows little or nothing of her new\r\nrights, and even when she does know, she has seldom the self-assertion\r\nto make a stand for them, but meekly submits to the dictates of those\r\nwhom she is bound by custom, if not by law, to respect and obey without\r\nquestion. But the fact that the laws have actually been improved means,\r\nin a country like Japan, in which the government is the moulder of\r\npublic opinion, that the custom will some day conform to the law.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of property owning, women, under the new code, are fairly\r\nindependent. As I have already stated, every woman in Japan is expected\r\nto become a wife, and as a matter of fact, the number of unmarried women\r\nis so small that it is hardly necessary to mention them. Wives, under\r\nJapanese law, are divided into two classes: the wife who enters her\r\nhusband's family, and the wife whose husband becomes a member of her\r\nfamily. In the latter case the wife is the head of the family, is\r\nresponsible for the debts of the family, and has the right to use and\r\nprofit by the husband's property. In the former case (and as I have\r\nalready stated, the great majority of wives enter their husband's\r\nfamilies), the husband is responsible, and has, consequently, the right\r\nto use and profit by his wife's property. In all cases, unless the\r\nhusband is physically or mentally unfit, he has the management of his\r\nwife's wealth. In case of the husband's disability the woman takes care\r\nof her own. A wife may, by application to a court, cause the husband to\r\nfurnish security for the property that she has intrusted to him; and she\r\nmay, with her husband's consent, engage in independent business. The\r\nproperty that she thus acquires is her own and not the husband's. Any\r\nproperty in the family, the ownership of which is not perfectly\r\nestablished, belongs to the head of the family, whether male or female.\r\nWe thus see that the law of Japan fully recognizes the right of married\r\nwomen to hold property, although only in exceptional cases are they\r\nallowed the management of their own holdings. The law also regards the\r\nwife, in household matters, as her husband's agent.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice, it is not uncommon for the wife to manage the entire\r\nincome of the family, receiving it from her husband and acting as his\r\ntreasurer. The wife's own earnings are seldom given to the husband, and\r\nher position is one of entire independence in the disposal of whatever\r\nshe adds to the family revenue. But should the wife bring into the\r\nfamily at marriage property which passes into the husband's management,\r\nthe chances are that, unless a divorce should occur, she will never lay\r\nany claim to the principal, or think of it again as her own. While her\r\nhusband cannot actually dispose of it without her consent, she is pretty\r\ncertain to give her consent should he ask it, and he may do very nearly\r\nanything that he chooses with it. We thus see that the tendency is to\r\ngive the management of the income, as a part of the management of the\r\nhousehold, to the woman, and leave the disposal of the principal, as a\r\npart of the outside business, to the care of the man. This system of\r\ndomestic finance seems not unlike the common practice in thrifty and\r\nwell-managed homes in America, and shows that a spirit of mutual\r\nconfidence between husband and wife belongs to Japan as to Western\r\nnations. As the result of my own observation in a number of homes, I\r\nshould say that the judgment of the wife in money matters is quite as\r\nmuch trusted in Japan as in America, and that, in this one respect at\r\nleast, her place in the home is as responsible a one as that of the\r\nWestern housekeeper. One instance may be cited of a woman whose business\r\nability is so well known as to have a national reputation. By birth a\r\nmember of a family which is remarkable for its success in all financial\r\nundertakings, she has inherited a large share of the family\r\ncharacteristic, and is credited with the personal management of a large\r\nbank, as well as other successful business undertakings. Her husband's\r\nname and not her own appears on the prospectuses and in the newspapers,\r\nbut unless report is very far astray, she is the business man of the\r\nfamily, and her sound sense and good judgment have built up the fortune\r\nwhich is their common possession.\r\n\r\nIn the educational system of Japan, schools for girls are provided by\r\nthe government, but no provision for studies more advanced than those of\r\nthe middle schools for boys is included in the scheme, with the single\r\nexception of the Higher Normal School in T[=o]ky[=o], in which a limited\r\nnumber of young women are trained to take positions as teachers in the\r\nordinary normal schools for girls. To quote from the Annual Report of\r\nthe Minister of Education for the year 1898, the latest to which I have\r\naccess, \"Higher female schools are institutions designed to give\r\ninstruction in such higher subjects of general education as are\r\nnecessary for females.\" This shows with considerable completeness the\r\nidea that dominates all government and much private effort for the\r\neducation of women in Japan. The schools are to teach simply such\r\nsubjects as are necessary for females; anything more would be\r\nsuperfluous, possibly dangerous. The thought of women as individuals,\r\nwith minds and souls to be trained and developed to their highest\r\npossibilities, is still somewhat foreign to the mind of the average\r\nJapanese man. In its stead is the idea that females must be instructed\r\nin such subjects as are necessary for a proper understanding of their\r\nduties as wives and mothers. But if Japan to-day is where England and\r\nAmerica were in the first half of the nineteenth century, the country is\r\ncertainly moving forward, as the statistics in regard to education for\r\nthe three successive years 1896, 1897, and 1898 show. Great efforts are\r\nbeing made to increase the attendance of girls at the common schools,\r\nand with gratifying results.[43]\r\n\r\n[43] The following in the report for 1898 may be of interest:--\r\n\r\nPercentage of pupils of school age receiving instruction:--\r\n\r\n  Year.          Girls.   Boys.\r\n  1896           47.54    79.00\r\n  1897           50.86    80.67\r\n  1898           53.73    82.42\r\n\r\nThe total number of girls of school age not receiving instruction is\r\n1,552,601; of boys, 662,985; while the total number of girls of school\r\nage is 3,642,263, and of boys, 4,067,161.\r\n\r\nAs we advance into the higher schools, the discrepancy in numbers\r\nbetween the two sexes grows greater. In the kindergartens the attendance\r\nof girls is nearly equal to that of boys; in the elementary schools\r\nthere are three boys to two girls; in the higher elementary schools,\r\nseven boys to two girls. The boys' middle schools, which are equivalent\r\nin grade to the girls' high schools, have fourteen boys taking their\r\ncourses to every two girls in the high schools. In the apprentice and\r\ntechnical schools, there are fifteen men to every two women. Even the\r\nnormal schools, which in our own country are almost given over to women,\r\nin Japan have six male students to every female. The \"special schools,\"\r\nmainly professional, have, to 11,069 men, 73 women, all enrolled in\r\nprivate schools, and presumably taking medical courses. Beyond this\r\npoint women have no opportunities offered to them. In the higher\r\nschools, equivalent to the college and graduate courses given by\r\nuniversities in America, 7,224 young men are given opportunities that\r\nwomen must go abroad to obtain.\r\n\r\nThese figures are, as I have said, for the year 1898. The year 1901 sees\r\ntwo hopeful movements well begun. One of these is the opening of an\r\ninstitution bearing the title of \"Female University,\" endowed and\r\nsupported by Japanese, through the strenuous efforts of Mr. Jinzo\r\nNaruse, a prominent Christian who has spent some time in America. At its\r\nopening, five hundred girls were glad to enter, but of these very few\r\nare ready for college work. Mr. Naruse, however, believes that in time\r\nhe will be able to enlarge his college department and diminish the\r\npreparatory, which is now almost the whole of the school. He has the\r\nsupport and encouragement of many wealthy and influential Japanese,\r\namong them Count Okuma, the well-known progressive statesman. On the day\r\nof the opening of the school, Count Okuma, in a speech from the\r\nplatform, said that the nation would be twice as strong if its women\r\nwere well educated. This he called \"setting up a double standard.\" He\r\npointed out that Turkey, Egypt, Persia, and China were countries which\r\nhad tried to get along with a \"single standard,\" and which had fallen\r\nconspicuously behind. He called attention to the fact that Japan's\r\nprimitive religion had for its central figure the Goddess of Light, but\r\nthat, unfortunately for the well-being of the state, woman had been\r\ngradually dethroned and thrust down into a low place. After speaking of\r\nthe debt that Japan owed to China for the civilization and the ethical\r\nsystem that had stood her so long in good stead, the veteran statesman\r\nwent on to say that society in Japan was disfigured by abuses which were\r\nbeyond any simple remedy. The only effective medicine was to be found in\r\na radical reform of the ideals of family life, and this could only be\r\neffected by an improvement in the status of woman,--an improvement which\r\nsuch institutions as the one that day opened would greatly aid in\r\nbringing about.\r\n\r\nThese words from one of the most honored leaders of Japanese thought\r\nvoice the feeling that is prevalent throughout Japan in this\r\nthirty-fourth year of Méiji. That it is actually moving both government\r\nand people is shown by the words of Mr. Kikuchi, Minister of Education,\r\nto the Council of Provincial Governors held in T[=o]ky[=o] in June,\r\n1901. In speaking of the progress of education throughout the country,\r\nhe stated his intention to push forward the work of secondary education\r\nfor girls, saying that a prefecture which refused to make provision for\r\nsuch education by 1903 might be compelled to do so by the government.\r\n\r\nThe other hopeful educational effort to which I have alluded is a school\r\nstarted on a small scale, but with a high standard, by a Japanese woman\r\nwhose name is almost as well known in America as in Japan, as an\r\neducator of great ability and earnestness of purpose. After many years\r\nof work as a teacher in the Peeresses' School, a place of great honor\r\nfrom the Japanese standpoint, she has resigned her position to carry out\r\na long-cherished plan. With the pecuniary aid of friends in America, she\r\nhas founded a school for the preparation of young women who have\r\nfinished the courses heretofore open to them, and who wish to become\r\nteachers of English in the Government schools. The examinations for such\r\npositions have always been open to women, but, because of the difficulty\r\nin securing proper preparation, there are few who pass them. Since its\r\nopening in September, 1900, the school has been crowded with promising\r\npupils, and the small accommodations with which it began, although\r\nalready once enlarged, are stretched to the uttermost. The girls come\r\nfrom the government high schools and from the mission schools, and the\r\ncourse offered to them of three years of study in English literature,\r\ncomposition, translation, and methods of teaching has proved a strong\r\nattraction. In recognition, perhaps, of this effort on behalf of her\r\ncountrywomen, certainly, of her position at the head of her profession,\r\nthis same woman has this year been appointed on the examining committee\r\nfor the government English examinations, an honor never before given to\r\none of her sex,--in itself a sign of the change in thought that the last\r\nfew years have wrought.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the education of women is moving forward,\r\npushed by the leading men of the country and aided by the earnest work\r\nof the women themselves. It is still far behind the education offered to\r\nmen, and the ideal of most of its promoters is limited to the purely\r\nutilitarian; but as long as it moves forward and not backward, and as\r\nlong as the years of work show an increased number of women fitted to\r\nmeet the changing conditions of the time, we do well to approve rather\r\nthan criticise, remembering that the problem is an exceedingly intricate\r\none, and one of which even the best-instructed foreigner can see only a\r\nsmall part of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe year 1901 sees the printing-press almost as much of a power in\r\nJapan as in the Western world, and it is interesting to notice that\r\namong the innumerable newspapers and magazines now published in the\r\ncountry there are some twenty or more devoted exclusively to the\r\ninterests of women. To be sure, these women's magazines do not undertake\r\nto furnish the loftiest intellectual pabulum, the best of them covering,\r\nperhaps, the same range of subjects that is included in \"Woman's\r\nJournals\" in the United States. They devote themselves largely to\r\nlectures on morals and manners, and instruction as to how best to\r\nperform the duties of the home. These magazines are for the most part\r\nwritten and edited by men, many of them very young men, and serve to\r\nshow rather what men desire that women should think and do, than to give\r\nany insight into the minds of the women themselves. With a combined\r\ncirculation of perhaps 40,000, they enter many homes, and do something,\r\nat least, toward the general enlightening and quickening of the feminine\r\nmind that is so noticeable in the Japan of to-day. In regard to the\r\ngeneral reading of Japanese women who have had the new education, my\r\nown observation leads me to believe that they keep themselves well\r\ninformed of what is going on in their own country, and of the outside\r\nworld so far as it affects their own country; but that their interest in\r\nthe world at large is less than that of American women, and only in\r\nexceptional cases do they care much for the sayings or doings of\r\nforeigners. In this respect they differ widely from the men, whose minds\r\nare reaching continually for new things to graft upon the old\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIn the whole list of publications on the woman question, nothing has\r\never come out in Japan that compares for outspokenness and radical\r\nsentiments with a book published within a year or two by Mr. Fukuzawa,\r\nthe most influential teacher that Japan has seen in this era of\r\nenlightenment. It is in two parts, the first an attack, conducted with\r\nmuch skill and humor, upon Kaibara's \"Great Learning of Woman,\" a book\r\nwhich for nearly four hundred years has been supposed to contain all\r\nthat a woman should know. The last part of Mr. Fukuzawa's work is a\r\nconstructive essay upon the \"New Great Learning of Woman.\" So\r\nrevolutionary are the sentiments expressed in the book that many\r\nJapanese men hesitate about allowing their wives and daughters to read\r\nit, and in at least one modern Christian school it has been ruled out\r\nfrom the school library as too advanced for the reading of the girls. A\r\nbrief survey of the sentiments and ideas thus boldly set forth will show\r\nhow far is the attitude of the Japanese from that of the American public\r\non the woman question. We find in Mr. Fukuzawa's book the lofty ideal\r\nthat belongs to the most advanced modern thought, but its promulgation\r\nas a practical working ideal in Japan was of the nature of a\r\nthunderclap. Among less tolerant races, men have been lynched, or burned\r\nat the stake, for slighter departures from the average code of thought\r\nand morals.\r\n\r\nMr. Fukuzawa starts out with the proposition that women are quite equal\r\nto men, and should hold equal position and influence. Although he allows\r\nthat woman's work in the world is quite distinct from that of man, he\r\nholds that it is as important, and that she should have the same\r\nproperty-holding privileges and rights. The greatest stress is laid on\r\nthe point that the same moral obligation for purity of life rests on the\r\nhusband as on the wife. He goes into the details of the unhappiness\r\nresulting from concubinage, putting the duty of the husband in this\r\nrespect as equal to that of the wife to preserve her chastity, and as\r\nthis is, next to obedience, the virtue of virtues for a Japanese wife,\r\nhis argument is as strong as it could well be made. He insists that\r\nwomen should demand as a right from their husbands and families the same\r\nprivileges and opportunities that men have in society.\r\n\r\nSuch sentiments are a matter of course in America, and they have been\r\nheld by a few advanced thinkers in Japan, but no one hitherto has dared\r\nin so vigorous and positive a way, and with arguments that come so near\r\nhome, to try to break the chain of custom that holds women down as\r\ninferior beings. Kaibara says that if a woman finds her husband doing\r\nwrong, she should gently plead with him, choosing a time when he is\r\nmost inclined to listen. If he refuses, she should not insist on his\r\nhearing her, but wait until he is willing to listen, and though she may\r\ntry two or three times, she should never anger or irritate him. Fukuzawa\r\nsays that if this applies to the woman, it should also to the man,--that\r\nis to say, if a man finds his wife unfaithful, he is to wait for an\r\nopportunity when she is in good humor before he remonstrates with her.\r\nFukuzawa also throws new light on the duty of husbands and fathers to\r\ntheir wives and children in another respect. He says that no man should\r\nlet the sole responsibility for the happiness of the home fall upon his\r\nwife; that a man is responsible for the peace of the home as well as the\r\nwoman. This view of the matter is entirely new in Japan, as the\r\nresponsibility for an unhappy home is laid as a matter of course upon\r\nthe wife. The duty of a wife to her parents-in-law is also treated after\r\nthe same revolutionary manner. Is it to be wondered at that many men\r\nfear the influence of such a book upon their gentle, submissive wives?\r\nIn this connection it is interesting, however, to note that at a recent\r\nShint[=o] wedding, after the religious ceremony, which in itself marks a\r\ngreat step forward in the Japanese ideal of marriage, the priest who\r\nunited the couple presented to the bride a copy each of the Kaibara and\r\nFukuzawa books, perhaps with a view to letting her take her choice\r\nbetween the old style and the new, perhaps that she might instruct her\r\nhusband out of the Fukuzawa book while she put in practice herself the\r\ntime-honored precepts of Kaibara.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne feature of the times in T[=o]ky[=o], that is perhaps worthy of passing\r\nnotice, is the tendency of women to form themselves into societies and\r\nclubs for the attainment of some common object. Of these women's clubs,\r\nthe greater proportion are perhaps educational, the members meeting once\r\na month or once a fortnight to listen to a lecture upon some subject\r\nthat helps to keep them up with the times. There is also a patriotic\r\nsociety, that concerns itself with raising money for sending supplies to\r\nsoldiers in the field, or for widows and orphans of soldiers, or to\r\nhelp along some other patriotic enterprise. There are societies, too,\r\nfor general benevolence, or to help in carrying on the work of some one\r\ninstitution. A glance at the membership lists of these associations\r\nshows that the motive power is, in almost all cases, the same group of\r\nearnest, educated women, who are, in this way and in countless others,\r\ndoing their utmost to broaden the horizons of their countrywomen, and\r\nlead them out into a larger life. This is probably true in the other\r\ncities in which a movement of women into clubs and societies is\r\nnoticeable.\r\n\r\nIt is when the active women of the new way of thinking, whose lives and\r\nthoughts are devoted to work and endeavor rather than to the passive\r\nsubmission and self-abnegation of the old days, find themselves suddenly\r\nplaced among the surroundings of thirty years ago, that the change of\r\nconditions becomes most evident. I cannot think of a better way to\r\nillustrate this than to tell the story of one of my Japanese friends and\r\nher visit to her husband's relatives in a distant provincial city. The\r\nlady who told me the story is a stirring, capable young matron,\r\neducated after the modern ways, who has spent most of her happy married\r\nlife of some fifteen or sixteen years entirely in T[=o]ky[=o], except\r\nfor a visit of a year to America. She bears a closer resemblance to many\r\nkind-hearted, strong, energetic young American women than to the\r\nold-time Japanese lady portrayed in these pages. She rises every morning\r\nat five, attends to every detail of her housekeeping, watches carefully\r\nand with educated common sense over her family of young children,\r\nbelieves in good food, fresh air, and exercise, for boys and girls\r\nalike, and is a helpful friend and good neighbor, filling to the full\r\nthe position of work and influence in which she is placed. Her husband\r\nis a successful business man, whom frequent journeys across the Pacific\r\nhave made thoroughly cosmopolitan, and their children are accustomed to\r\na freedom from conventional restraints and a healthful diet and regimen\r\nsuch as old Japan never knew.\r\n\r\nLast year the plan of spending the summer with the husband's relatives,\r\nwhich had been long projected, was actually carried out, and the whole\r\nfamily migrated to the provincial city from which the husband had\r\nsprung. The aged mother, a gentlewoman of the old type, was delighted to\r\nmeet and entertain her daughter-in-law and grandchildren, and did her\r\nbest, with all old-fashioned courtesy, to make the visit a pleasant one.\r\nThe house was clean and spacious, the mats soft and white, the bows of\r\nthe lowest, the voices and speech the politest that Japan could furnish,\r\nbut the healthy, restless children found the conventional restraints\r\nirksome, and the old-fashioned diet of rice and pickles, with hardly a\r\nvariation from morning till night and from week to week, was quite\r\ndifferent from the bountiful table to which they had been accustomed.\r\nThe younger woman could not criticise her mother-in-law's arrangements,\r\nneither could she bear to see her children growing thin and pale before\r\nher eyes. She consulted her husband, who, in accordance with the antique\r\nideas of propriety, was served his meals at a different time and in a\r\ndifferent room from his wife and family. To his food his mother had\r\nalways added various delicacies which her old-time Spartan spirit would\r\nnot allow her to set before her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. It\r\nwould have been quite contrary to her ideas of rank and etiquette for\r\nher to make any modification of her ordinary fare for them. As the son\r\nwas already supplying the funds for carrying on his mother's\r\nestablishment, it occurred to him that he might increase her allowance\r\non the plea that her summer expenses must be heavy with so large an\r\naddition to her household. But the old lady was sure that nothing more\r\nwas necessary, and would not think of burdening her son with any larger\r\nexpenses, and could not be induced to accept the offered increase.\r\n\r\nAnother effort was made to get along upon the meagre fare, but the\r\nyoungest boy fell ill and had to be taken to a hospital, and the mother\r\ndecided that something must be done if all the family did not wish to\r\nfollow him. The happy thought occurred to her of buying something that\r\nwould be an addition to their scanty menu, and giving it as a present\r\nto her mother-in-law. Now a present in Japan can never be refused, so it\r\nseemed to the younger woman that she must have found a way of escape\r\nfrom her difficulties. Of course, the present was accepted with many\r\nthanks and expressions of unworthiness, and when the meal-hour arrived,\r\neach member of the family found an infinitesimal quantity of the\r\ndelicacy in a small plate at his side. But as soon as the meal was over,\r\nthe dear old lady, who had by strict economy managed to leave the\r\ngreater part of the gift untouched, sent out to all the neighbors\r\npresents from what had been intended to feed the hungry children at\r\nhome. The experiment was tried again and again, but always with the same\r\nresult. No present could be kept for family use alone. Of everything but\r\nthe barest necessaries, the greater part must be sent out in gifts to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAt last the husband and wife put their heads together to decide on some\r\ncourse of action that, without hurting the feelings of the older lady,\r\nwould secure sufficient nourishment for the children, and forthwith\r\nbegan a series of all-day picnics to the noted places in the\r\nvicinity,--picnics that included always a good meal at some well-kept\r\nrestaurant before the return to the old-fashioned fare of the\r\ngrandmother's house. In this way the summer was passed without further\r\nillness, though the poor mother on her return to T[=o]ky[=o] spent several\r\nweeks in bed,--what with starvation and worry and the effort to bear\r\nheroically, and with a smiling face, the hard life and scanty fare that\r\nwere the life and fare of most of Japan only a few years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the changes that the past few years have wrought, perhaps nothing is\r\nmore striking than the new openings for work that Japan now offers to\r\nwomen. The growth of the public school system has made a demand for\r\nwomen as teachers that is steadily increasing. Although in the normal\r\nschools the proportion of women to men is still only one to six, and\r\nwhile teaching, even in the primary schools, is not yet mainly in\r\nfeminine hands as it is with us, there is still a good showing of women\r\nemployed as teachers. From the figures of the school report of 1898, we\r\nfind over 10,000 women as teachers and assistants in the public and\r\nprivate schools. The profession of nursing, too, which ten years ago was\r\njust opening, has already drawn many women into its ranks. In the Red\r\nCross hospitals alone there are this year nearly a thousand nurses\r\ntaking the course, and a thousand graduates scattered throughout the\r\ncountry hold themselves ready to answer the call of the society in the\r\ntime of need, in the mean time practicing their profession wherever they\r\nmay chance to be. The quality of the Red Cross graduates has been tested\r\nnow in two wars, and they show the soldierly virtues of their nation, as\r\nwell as the more womanly qualities of tenderness and gentleness; and a\r\nself-respect that has kept them pure and free from stain in the midst of\r\nsevere temptation. It is impossible for me to gather statistics of the\r\nwork done by other institutions for the training of nurses, but the\r\nfigures given above may, I think, be doubled with absolute safety in\r\nmaking an estimate of the total number of nurses trained and in training\r\nthroughout the empire.\r\n\r\nThe growth of commerce and industry has greatly increased the demand\r\nfor feminine labor outside the home. In the old days the two most\r\nimportant industries of the country, tea and silk, were mainly carried\r\non by women in their homes, but the use of modern machinery is rapidly\r\ntaking the weaving industries out of the homes and making factory hands\r\nof the women and children.[44]\r\n\r\n[44] In the Japan _Mail_ of July 8, 1901, the following statistics of\r\nwomen employees in factories in Japan were given:--\r\n\r\n  Manufacture.      No. of Women.   No. to 100 Men.\r\n  Raw Silk            107,348            93\r\n  Cotton Spinning      53,053            79\r\n  Matches              11,385            69\r\n  Cotton Fabrics       10,656            86\r\n  Tobacco               7,874            72\r\n  Matting               1,641            59\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable effects of this new demand for female labor\r\nis the extreme scarcity of servants. Although wages are nearly double\r\nwhat they were ten years ago, it is extremely difficult for Japanese\r\nhousekeepers now to find servants to replace the old ones as they drop\r\nout of the ranks, and the women who apply for positions are apt to be\r\nfar inferior to those who came to the same families to do the same work\r\nten years ago.\r\n\r\nIn other ways, too, women are learning to fill new places in the world.\r\nThe telephone, which now connects towns and cities and villages in\r\nJapan, employs girls in large numbers. In the printing-offices we find\r\nwomen at work, not as compositors, but as compositors' assistants,\r\ndarting from case to case about the room and selecting for the\r\ncompositor the ideographs that he needs in his work. Inasmuch as a small\r\nprinting-office cannot get along with less than four thousand\r\ncharacters, and as larger ones may have several times that number, the\r\nneed of quick-witted and quick-footed assistants to each compositor may\r\nbe easily recognized. As the schools turn out each year more girls\r\nfitted by education to do this kind of work, and as the number of\r\nnewspapers and other printed matter is continually on the increase, the\r\ndemand for and supply of this special variety of labor are likely to\r\nincrease proportionately for some time to come.\r\n\r\nA few women are now making their way as reporters on the daily papers,\r\na few more are engaged in literary work. One of the best of modern\r\nJapanese novelists was a woman, but she died several years ago at so\r\nearly an age that her work was a promise rather than a fulfillment.\r\nArtists, too, there are, who are making names for themselves, as well as\r\na living, in a country where art is so common that success in that line\r\nmeans hard work and special talent. A few young women support themselves\r\nby stenography, a few more as clerks and secretaries in business\r\noffices. Until a writing-machine has been invented that will write four\r\nthousand characters, there will not be much demand for typewriter girls\r\nin Japan outside of the treaty ports, where a few are now employed. The\r\nJapanese government has found, as Uncle Sam discovered some time ago,\r\nthat for the counting of paper money women's fingers are more deft than\r\nthose of men, and it consequently gives employment to a few women in\r\nthat work. One railroad has recently begun to employ women as\r\nticket-sellers, and three medical schools have already graduated some\r\nwomen physicians, though it is still doubtful whether there is any\r\ngreat opening for them in the country. These are some of the ways in\r\nwhich women now find themselves able to gain a little more independence\r\nof life. The whole matter is so new that no statistics are available\r\nthat will show the exact extent of the demand for labor in these\r\ndirections, but from my own observation I am inclined to think that\r\nthere is little change in the employments of women except in the\r\nneighborhood of the larger cities, and that the new occupations as yet\r\nhave a very slight effect upon the conditions in this country at large.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to understand the actual progress made in Japan in\r\nimproving the condition of women, without some consideration of the\r\neffect that Christian thought and Christian lives have had on the\r\nthought and lives of the modern Japanese. If Japanese women are ever to\r\nbe raised to the measure of opportunity accorded to women in Christian\r\ncountries, it can only be through the growth of Christianity in their\r\nown country, and for that reason a study of that growth is pertinent to\r\na study of their condition.\r\n\r\nThe past ten years in Japan have been discouraging to the missionaries\r\nin many ways, and it is not unusual to hear from the less hopeful of\r\nthem the statement that their work has been at a standstill, or even\r\ngoing backward, during that time. The statistics of missionary effort\r\nshow a steady, though slight, increase in the number of professing\r\nChristians, but if the sum total of the results of missionary effort\r\nwere the number of converts made, it might, perhaps, be doubtful whether\r\nthe money spent on missions in Japan might not be better turned to other\r\npurposes. There are now in Japan, of Christians of all sects,\r\nProtestant, and Roman and Greek Catholic, 121,000, or about one half of\r\none per cent. of the total population of the country; but the influence\r\nof these Christians as leaders of thought is out of all proportion to\r\ntheir number. Christian men are found in the Diet, in the army and navy,\r\nin the universities and colleges, and in the newspaper offices, in a\r\nproportion far beyond their ratio to the total population, exerting\r\ntheir influence in many ways for the uplifting of the nation to loftier\r\nmoral ideals. The proportion of Christian men and women in the\r\ngovernment schools with which I have been connected is rather\r\nsurprising. In the Higher Normal School, training young women to go out\r\ninto the whole country as teachers, the proportion of professing\r\nChristians upon the teaching staff is striking; and in the Peeresses'\r\nSchool, which is as conservative and anti-foreign as any educational\r\ninstitution in Japan, there are five professing Christians among the\r\nthirty-five teachers. While, on the one hand, the Japanese Christians\r\nare not all models of all the virtues, while there is with many of them\r\na tendency to modify their Christianity so as to accommodate a\r\nconsiderable amount of worldly wisdom, it is true, on the other hand,\r\nthat the most active workers in the cause of philanthropy are men who\r\nhave accepted the Christian faith, and who are striving in all\r\nearnestness to model their lives after the life of Jesus of Nazareth.\r\nThe Christian Church in Japan to-day has its heroes and its\r\nback-sliders, and has between these two extremes a rank and file of\r\nevery-day, commonplace men and women, who amidst frequent failures and\r\nin the midst of many temptations are making the name of Christian stand\r\nfor a certain kind of life and a certain standard of virtue quite above\r\nand beyond the lives and standards of their countrymen. It is largely\r\nbecause of them that a Christian public opinion is growing up among\r\nnon-Christian Japanese. Men to-day who have no special leanings toward\r\nChristianity shake their heads over vices and sins which a few years ago\r\nwere not even thought of as wrong. There is a great deal of talk about\r\nthe growth of moral depravity in the country, but as a matter of fact,\r\nthe standards of virtue have never been so high since Japan was opened\r\nas they are to-day: it is only that Christian thought has held up a\r\nmirror to an un-Christian society, in which it views all too clearly its\r\nown defects. There is, to my mind, no more hopeful sign of the times\r\nthan the growing discouragement over the present condition of morals.\r\nWhen there is added to this a steadily increasing respect for the\r\nhonesty and strength of character of Christian men and women, it must\r\nmean that a great and lasting impression has been made. To-day banks,\r\nbusiness offices, and other places requiring trustworthy clerks and\r\nemployees, prefer, other things being equal, Christian young men, for it\r\nis generally known that they are more worthy of confidence than the\r\nmajority of applicants for such places.\r\n\r\nOne instance of this increased moral sensitiveness may be cited in the\r\nrecent successful efforts to limit the power of the brothel-keepers over\r\ntheir victims and virtual slaves, the _j[=o]r[=o]_ or licensed\r\nprostitutes. As I have stated in a previous chapter, the women who carry\r\non this business in Japan are, many of them, unwilling victims of a\r\nsystem which allows parents to sell their children to a life of shame;\r\nand they enter upon that life so young that they can hardly be regarded\r\nas morally responsible for their condition. Even after the actual sale\r\nof girls was forbidden by an imperial ordinance in 1872, the purchase\r\nprice was called a loan to the parents of the girl, and subsequent\r\nloans for clothing entered upon the books of the establishment kept the\r\nunfortunates so continually in debt to their masters that they could\r\nnever escape from the bondage in which they were held except through\r\ndeath, or by purchase by some infatuated admirer. Public opinion, while\r\nit indulged in some sentimental pity for the hard lot of the\r\n_j[=o]r[=o]_, did little or nothing to aid any one who desired to help\r\nthem, regarding the profession as a necessary one, and caring not at all\r\nfor the injustice to which the girls were subjected. Ten or twelve years\r\nago, a movement started by some prominent Japanese Christians against\r\nthe _j[=o]roya_ fell flat for want of a public opinion behind it.\r\nSpeeches on the subject were hissed down by audiences of young men, and\r\nnothing could be done to help even the most innocent and unhappy of the\r\ngirls to a better life. In the new code, perhaps as an effect of this\r\nmovement, a new law provided that the _j[=o]r[=o]_ might leave her\r\ncalling by giving notice to the police. A police regulation, however,\r\nforbade any girl to cease her employment, or to leave the house in\r\nwhich she was kept, unless her official notice of cessation was\r\ncountersigned by the keeper of the _j[=o]roya_, so that by her own\r\neffort she could not free herself.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1900, one of these girls in a provincial city appealed to an\r\nAmerican missionary for help in getting her liberty. Through his aid,\r\nand that of his Japanese helpers, her case came before the court, which\r\ndecided that the contract under which she was held was opposed to the\r\npublic welfare and good morals, and that the keeper must affix his seal\r\nto her notice without regard to her debt. Although the local police\r\nrefused to act in the matter, and although the missionary and his\r\nhelpers were subjected to personal violence by the employees of the\r\n_j[=o]roya_, an appeal to the authorities at T[=o]ky[=o] resulted in an\r\nenforcement of the court's decision, and the girl was freed.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the Salvation Army, which has a valiant contingent in\r\nT[=o]ky[=o], and which was actually spoiling for a good fight with the\r\nworld, the flesh, and the Devil, in any form, took up the cause of the\r\noppressed _j[=o]r[=o]_. A special edition of the \"War Cry\" containing\r\nappeals to the girls to leave their lives of shame, and offering aid to\r\nany one who might apply to the Army, was published and hawked through\r\nthe Yoshiwara. When the keepers and their employees found out what the\r\nstrangely costumed news-venders were about, they charged down upon them,\r\nand after a street fight, drove them out of the quarter. Thus the war\r\nbegan, but the T[=o]ky[=o] police took up the matter, the T[=o]ky[=o]\r\npress joined hands with the Salvationists, and in the end the whole\r\ncountry was stirred to aid in the attack. In return, the brothel-keepers\r\nand their employees, feeling that the profits of their business were at\r\nstake, made it extremely warm for any Salvationists or newspaper\r\nreporters who dared set foot in the disreputable quarters, and in their\r\nzeal sometimes made mistakes and drove out their would-be patrons. The\r\noffice of one newspaper was wrecked by sympathetic roughs, and it took a\r\nsquad of fifty or sixty police to escort Army officers when they had\r\noccasion to visit any of the houses to secure the release of a girl. No\r\nlives were lost, though some hard knocks were received, and the work was\r\nkept up with unabated noise on both sides, until every girl held in\r\nunwilling bondage knew how she might escape and to whom she could go for\r\naid.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of September, 1900, as a direct result of the attacks\r\nof and upon the Army, the number of visitors to these houses in\r\nT[=o]ky[=o] was decreased by about 2,000 a night. On October 2, a\r\ngovernment ordinance was issued that at one stroke removed all obstacles\r\nin the way of a girl's securing her freedom at any moment when she\r\nwanted to leave the business. The new regulations made the descent to\r\nAvernus as difficult as possible, and the return to the upper world a\r\nmere step. In T[=o]ky[=o] alone, in the first four months after the\r\npromulgation of this order, 1,100 out of the 6,335 girls who were\r\nlicensed as prostitutes left the houses in which they were employed,\r\nmost of them returning to their homes and families, and as many as\r\napplied being cared for in the Rescue Home of the Salvation Army. The\r\nplaces thus vacated are not easy to fill, because the keepers will not\r\nadvance money to the parents of a girl, now that they can no longer hold\r\nher as security for the debt. In consequence, too, of the revelations of\r\nthe evils of the system, the business has fallen off alarmingly. Thus\r\nmany of the houses have been obliged to close, owing to lack of custom\r\nand to inability to pay the heavy taxes.\r\n\r\nWe have here the story of a successful attack on a system which has\r\nexisted in Japan for three hundred years, by a Christian agency acting\r\nwith the support of so strong a public opinion that police and\r\ngovernment have felt bound to obey its behests. There has been no more\r\nstriking example of the effect of Christian thought upon public\r\nsentiment in any country than this crusade against the brothels in\r\nJapan. When we remember that ten years ago it was not possible for a\r\nspeaker to attack the institution before an audience of students without\r\nbeing silenced by hisses, it is interesting to note that this year, the\r\nstudents of that same school greeted with applause and respectful\r\nattention an address on this very subject.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me rather striking that in the year 1900 fifty thousand\r\ncopies of the Bible were sold in Japan--more than of any other book.\r\nAlthough the present translation is regarded as far from perfect, and\r\nmuch of it is unintelligible to the average Japanese without\r\ninstruction, whether directly or indirectly, by mission workers, it is\r\nstill sought after and read for the sake of its literature, and because\r\nof the reputation that has been gained for it throughout the country.\r\nThere are few missionaries of any experience in Japan who cannot tell\r\nstories of men coming to them from country villages, who, through the\r\nreading of a copy of the Bible in some way fallen into their hands, have\r\nbeen brought by the beauty and nobility of the parts that they could\r\nunderstand to seek additional explanation from some teacher or preacher.\r\nOne case that is amusing, but at the same time striking, I have heard\r\nvouched for from a number of sources:--\r\n\r\nTwo thieves, one night, broke into the dormitory of a girls' school in\r\nsearch of booty, and by chance awakened two of the girls. As they sat\r\nup in their beds, wondering what was best to do under the circumstances,\r\none zealous damsel reached for the Bible in which she had been reading\r\nbefore she went to sleep, and handed it to one of the thieves, saying,\r\n\"If you read this book, you will not want to steal any more.\" The other\r\ngirl followed her companion's example and gave her Bible to the other\r\nthief. That was all, so far as the girls knew, and it was some years\r\nbefore the sequel came to light.\r\n\r\nThere is one place in Japan to which released convicts who are trying to\r\nget back to respectability again drift from all parts of the empire. It\r\nis a prisoners' home in T[=o]ky[=o], where one man, aided by his capable\r\nand devoted wife, receives into his own family and gives aid and succor\r\nto hundreds of society's outcasts. To this place came one day an\r\nex-convict who told a remarkable story of his conversion, and of his\r\ndesire to lead a new life. He had received a Bible from a little girl\r\none night in a house that he was robbing, but was too full of\r\nprofessional engagements at the time to follow her advice and read it.\r\nLater, however, as he was resting from his labors in the enforced\r\nseclusion of a prison, he began to read, and spelled out enough to make\r\nup his mind that he did not want to steal any more. Accordingly, as soon\r\nas his term was ended, he made his way to the prisoners' refuge, and by\r\nthe aid of its founder and head, and his good wife, settled down to\r\nsteady habits of industry. Later, when the prison look had worn off from\r\nhis face and the prison gait from his walk, he returned to his family\r\nand friends, where he is now a respectable member of the society upon\r\nwhich he formerly preyed.\r\n\r\nThere are other stories showing as deep impressions made on men of\r\nculture and respectability, not so striking and amusing as this one, but\r\nmeaning as much, or even more, for the future of Japan. Such things are\r\nhardly possible in Christian countries to-day, for there is little or no\r\nnovelty in the message that the old book brings to us; but to the\r\nJapanese mind the thoughts are absolutely new in many ways, and the\r\nreading alone will often change the whole life, because it lifts up the\r\nnature to a higher set of ideals.\r\n\r\nAs a direct effect of Christian thought upon the thought of the\r\nJapanese nation, it is interesting to notice the change in meaning of\r\none word. In the teachings of Confucius the highest virtue is\r\nbenevolence, rendered into Japanese by the word _jin_; in the teachings\r\nof Buddhism the highest virtue is mercy, or _jishi_. When the Christian\r\nmissionaries first came to Japan, there was no term in the language that\r\ncovered the thought of love as it is taught by Christ. For lack of\r\nanything better, the word _ai_, which indicated the love of a superior\r\nfor an inferior, was made to do duty for the greater thought; and now\r\nthe old word _ai_, throughout the length and breadth of Japan, is\r\naccepted and understood in its new meaning, a continual witness to the\r\neffect of Christianity upon the national mind. Is this a little thing in\r\nthe education of a race that has shown in the past so great a capacity\r\nfor living up to its ideals?\r\n\r\nOne more direct effect of Christian teaching upon Japanese society is\r\nthe great quickening of philanthropic and benevolent effort. Scattered\r\nthroughout the country are benevolent or educational societies,\r\norphanages, hospitals, free kindergartens, reform schools, and other\r\nevidences of a desire on the part of the more fortunate to help the\r\nunfortunate by some means or other; and if you study into the history of\r\nany of these efforts, you will usually find that some Japanese\r\nChristian, or some man who has come home impressed with the\r\nphilanthropies of Christian countries, has started the scheme, and has\r\ncreated a society, and a public opinion behind the society, which\r\ncarries on the work. Even in the government institutions there is no\r\ndifficulty in tracing the influence of Christians and Christianity. The\r\nRed Cross Society, with its seven thousand members, and its hospitals in\r\nevery prefecture of the empire, bears the sign of Christendom upon all\r\nits property and employees. It seems to me quite safe to say that but\r\nfor the Christian influences of the past forty years, there would be\r\nvery little altruistic work done in Japan to-day; but by means of the\r\nChristians and their teachings, the latest and best thought of the world\r\nis working its way out in practical service for humanity in Japan, and\r\nthis service is ascribed by enlightened Buddhist and Shint[=o] believers\r\nalike to the spirit of Christianity, which will not let the fortunate\r\nrest while their less fortunate brothers are in want or sin.\r\n\r\nNo one who studies the religious question in Japan at all can fail to\r\nnotice the extraordinary revivifying of Buddhism for what it feels to be\r\na life and death struggle with an alien faith. The disestablishment of\r\nthe Buddhist church by the government at the time of the restoration\r\nmust be credited with its share of the awakening process; for the\r\npriests, finding their own support and that of the temples dependent\r\nupon the voluntary contributions of worshipers, were forced to bestir\r\nthemselves as they had not done since the old missionary days, when they\r\nwere working for a foothold in the country. But without the competition\r\nof Christianity, it is extremely doubtful whether their efforts would\r\nhave been turned so largely along educational and philanthropic lines,\r\nwhether the standard of intelligence among the priesthood would have\r\nbeen so quickly raised, whether they would have sent young men abroad to\r\nstudy Sanskrit and history with a view to a better understanding of\r\ntheir own scriptures, or whether they would not rather have relied on\r\nless radical methods of quickening the religious life within their body.\r\nCertain it is that Buddhism, which upon its introduction into Japan\r\nactually lowered the status of women, is now making a bid for public\r\nfavor by holding meetings and founding societies especially for women,\r\nand is doing its best to increase their self-respect and the respect in\r\nwhich they are held by society.\r\n\r\nAn interesting story which throws some light upon the new influence that\r\nis at work among the Buddhists came to me not long ago through a\r\nJapanese friend. There were two brothers living in a poor little village\r\non the northern coast of Japan, who were joint heirs to a small piece of\r\nproperty. As the land was not enough for the support of two families,\r\nthe elder brother, a gentle, thoughtful youth, gave up all title to his\r\nshare of the inheritance and entered a Buddhist monastery. In the quiet\r\nof this retreat, amid the beautiful surroundings, the daily services,\r\nthe chanting of priests, and the mellow booming of the great monastery\r\nbell, his thoughts went out to the poor and the sinful among his own\r\npeople. He began to feel that a life which seeks merely spiritual uplift\r\nfor itself is not the highest life, and that only as spiritual gain is\r\nshared with others is it real and lasting. Forthwith he began a life of\r\nhelpfulness to the poor about him,--of teaching and preaching and good\r\ndeeds that won him many humble friends. Within the monastery, however,\r\nhis work was not approved. His ideas and actions were not in harmony\r\nwith the teachings of the sect. He was first disciplined and then\r\nexpelled, and found his way back at last, penniless, to his native\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nNow, in northern Japan the winters are long and hard, and the most\r\nindustrious of farmers and fisher-folk can wring only a bare subsistence\r\nfrom the conditions of their toil. It is from these villages, perhaps,\r\nmore than from any other sources, that the girls are obtained to supply\r\nthe _j[=o]roya_ of the great cities. At any rate, in this particular\r\nvillage, the only hope that any girl possessed of escaping from the hard\r\nhome toil was by the sale of her person, and the thought of seeing the\r\ngreat cities, of wearing beautiful dresses, of being admired and petted,\r\nand perhaps at last of marrying some rich lover and becoming a great\r\nlady, was a tempting bait to these poor peasant girls. To this young\r\nman, whose soul had been awakened to a new sensitiveness during his\r\nabsence, the full horror of the conditions that could so warp and dwarf\r\nthe souls of women appealed as it had never done before. He must do\r\nsomething to help them, but what to do his previous experience did not\r\nhelp him to know. He sought for aid and sympathy in his native place,\r\namong his friends and co-religionists; but the state of affairs was too\r\nold and too familiar to excite interest, and at last he worked his way\r\nto the capital, feeling that somewhere in that great city he would find\r\nlight on the question that perplexed him. It was a mere question of ways\r\nand means--how to begin a work which he felt driven from within to do.\r\nIn T[=o]ky[=o], as he inquired among his friends, he was told that\r\nChristians knew all about the kind of work that he wished to begin, that\r\nhe must go to them and study their methods, if he would help the people\r\nof his native village. So the devout young Buddhist, who had found in\r\nhis own faith the divine impulse, turned to the study of what Christians\r\nhad done and were doing for the unfortunate. The story is not finished\r\nyet. We cannot tell whether in the end it will result in another\r\naddition to the ranks of the Japanese Christians, or whether it will aid\r\nin the quickening that has come to Buddhism, but, whatever way it ends,\r\nit shows in a concrete example what Christianity is now doing for Japan,\r\nand especially for the women of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n_The following Notes refer to passages marked by asterisks in the\r\nforegoing pages._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 3._\r\n\r\nThe father, or the head of the family, usually names the children, but\r\nsome friend or patron may be asked to do it. As, until recently, the\r\nname given a child in infancy was not the one that he was expected to\r\nbear through life, the choice of a name was not a matter of as much\r\nimportance as it is with us. In some families the boys are called by\r\nnames indicating their position in the family, the words _Taro_, \"Big\r\none,\" _Jiro_, \"Second one,\" _Saburo_, \"Third one,\" _Shiro_, \"Fourth\r\none,\" _Goro_, \"Fifth one,\" etc., being used alone, or placed after\r\nadjectives indicating some quality that it is hoped the child may\r\npossess. Such combinations are, _Eitaro_, \"Glorious big one,\" _Seijiro_,\r\n\"Pure second one,\" _Tomisaburo_, \"Rich third one,\" and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 4._\r\n\r\nTo speak with greater exactness, the _miya mairi_ of a boy is on the\r\nthirty-first day of his life,--of a girl, on the thirty-third.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 8._\r\n\r\nT[=o]ky[=o] just now shows a tendency to change this national custom.\r\nGayly painted wicker baby carriages with cotton awnings are seen in\r\nlarge quantities in the shops, and one meets mothers and little sisters\r\nof the lower classes, propelling the baby in a little four-wheeled wagon\r\ninstead of wearing it on the back, as formerly. These carriages are, of\r\ncourse, the exception, and may prove to be but a passing T[=o]ky[=o]\r\nfashion, but they seem to me to mark another step in the modernizing of\r\nJapan, and may prove of value in the physical development of the common\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 11._\r\n\r\nIn the T[=o]ky[=o] of 1891 butchers and milkmen were very little in\r\nevidence, as the demand for their wares came mainly from the few\r\nforeigners and foreign restaurants in the city. In 1901 a walk of half a\r\nmile or so in the neighborhood of Kojimachi, one of the principal\r\nbusiness streets in a purely Japanese section of the city, shows five\r\nmeat shops; and milkmen, in westernized shirts and knickerbockers, with\r\ngolf-stockings and straw sandals, draw their gay-colored carts\r\neverywhere through the city, and call at a large proportion of the\r\nhouses. Condensed milk, too, is to be found on the shelves of every\r\nprovision store, together with canned and dried meats, and the\r\nrestaurants where foreign food is served are distributed throughout the\r\nentire city, and do a thriving business on Japanese patronage. The less\r\nextravagant country people declare that T[=o]ky[=o] is \"eating itself\r\nup,\" but so far no terrible increase of indebtedness seems to follow the\r\nchange in the standard of living. It is interesting to note that the\r\nscalp troubles referred to on page 11 seem to have greatly lessened in\r\nthe last ten years, whether because of the change in the food or for\r\nother reasons, I cannot determine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 24._\r\n\r\nTwice, after the _miya mairi_ of her babyhood, does our little maid\r\nrepair to the temple to seek the blessing of her patron god upon a step\r\nforward in her short life: once, when at the age of three, the hair on\r\nher small head, which until then has been shaved in fancy patterns, is\r\nallowed to begin its growth toward the coiffure of womanhood; and once,\r\nwhen she has attained her seventh year, and exchanges the soft, narrow\r\nsash of infancy for the stiff, wide _obi_ which is the pride of every\r\nwell-dressed Japanese woman. Her little brother, too, though now no\r\nlonger destined to wear the hammer-shaped queue of the old-time Japanese\r\nwarrior, and whose fuzzy black head is now usually left unshaven in his\r\nbabyhood, still goes to the temple at the age of three to give thanks,\r\nand when he comes to be five years old, the little boy again goes up to\r\nthe temple, this time wearing for the first time the manly _hakama_, or\r\nkilt-pleated trousers, and makes offerings to the god who has protected\r\nhim thus far.\r\n\r\nThe day set for these ceremonies is the 15th of November, and there is\r\nno prettier sight in all Japan than a popular temple on that day. All\r\nthe streets that converge on the shrine are crowded with gayly dressed\r\nchildren hurrying along to make their offerings, accompanied by parents\r\nbrimming with pride and pleasure.\r\n\r\n    \"Small feet are pattering, wooden shoes clattering,\r\n     Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering:\"\r\n\r\nthree-year-old tots of both sexes trudging sturdily along on their\r\nclogs: square little red-cheeked boys, their black eyes shining with\r\npride in their rustling new silk _hakama_, feeling that they are big\r\nboys and no longer to be confused with the babies that they were\r\nyesterday: here, too, are the graceful seven-year-old maidens, their\r\nmany-colored garments and their gorgeous new _obi_ setting off to\r\nadvantage their shining black hair and sparkling eyes. The children are\r\nso many, so happy, and so impressed with the fun that it is to be older\r\nthan they were, that the grown folks who accompany them seem like\r\nshadows; the only real thing is the children.\r\n\r\nWithin the temple precincts all the candy-sellers and toy-merchants who\r\ncan find standing-room for a stall are doing a brisk trade. Flags are\r\nflying, drums are beating, a _kagura_ dance is going on in the pavilion,\r\nabout which stands a crowd of youngsters twittering like sparrows, and\r\nthe steps that lead to the temple itself are as thronged as Jacob's\r\nladder with little ones ascending and descending. Within the shrine the\r\nwhite-robed priests are hard at work from morning to night. A little\r\ncompany forms in the vestibule, goes to the priest in the first room,\r\nwhere they bow and make their offerings, and wait until there is space\r\nfor them in the inner sanctuary. From within comes the sound of a\r\ndroning chant, which ends at last, and then a party that has finished\r\nits worship issues forth, and those who have been waiting without go in;\r\nand when the few minutes of worship are over, and the amulet that\r\nrewards the due observance of the day has been received, there are the\r\ndances to be seen, and the _o miyagé_ to be purchased, and at last the\r\nhappy party returns, feeling that one more milestone on the journey of\r\nlife has been passed propitiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 30._\r\n\r\nThe _shir[=o]zaké_ (white _saké_) used for this occasion is a curious\r\ndrink, thick and white, made from pounded rice, and brewed especially\r\nfor this feast. Some antiquarians believe that it is simply the earliest\r\nform of _saké_, the national beverage, which has been preserved in this\r\nancient observance as the fly is preserved in amber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 31._\r\n\r\nThe keeping of a feast on the third day of the third month is a custom\r\nthat has come down from very ancient times. At first the day was set\r\napart for the purification of the people, and a part of the ceremony was\r\nthe rubbing of the body with bits of white paper, roughly cut into the\r\nsemblance of a white-robed priest. These paper dolls were believed to\r\ntake away the sins of the year. When they had been used for\r\npurification, they were inscribed with the sex and birth-year of the\r\nuser and thrown into the river. The third month was also, in early\r\ntimes, the season for cock-fighting among the men, and for doll-playing\r\namong the women. The special name by which the dolls of the Doll Feast\r\nare called is _O Hina Sama_. Now _hina_ in modern Japanese means a\r\nchicken or other young bird, and is never used to mean anything else\r\nexcept the dolls; thus the dolls are shown to be associated with the\r\nancient cock-fighting, an amusement which has now almost gone out,\r\nexcept in the province of Tosa on the island of Shikoku.\r\n\r\nThe oldest dolls did not represent the Emperor and Empress, but simply a\r\nman and a woman, and were modeled closely after the old white paper\r\ndolls of the religious ceremony. When the Tokugawa Sh[=o]guns had firmly\r\nestablished their splendid court at Yedo, a decree was issued\r\ndesignating the five feast days upon which the daimi[=o]s were to\r\npresent themselves at the Sh[=o]gun's palace and offer their\r\ncongratulations. One of the days thus appointed was the third day of the\r\nthird month. It is believed that the giving of the chief place at the\r\nfeast to effigies of the Emperor and Empress was a part of the policy of\r\nthe Sh[=o]gunate,--a policy which aimed to keep alive the spirit of\r\nloyalty to the throne, while at the same time the occupant of the throne\r\nremained a puppet in the hands of his vice-gerent.\r\n\r\nEach girl born into a family has a pair of _O Hina Sama_ placed for her\r\nupon the red-covered shelf, on the first Feast of Dolls that comes after\r\nher birth. When, as a bride, she goes to her husband's house, she\r\ncarries the dolls with her, and the first feast after her marriage she\r\nobserves with special ceremonies. Until she has a daughter old enough\r\nto carry out the observance, she must keep up the ceremony. The feast,\r\nas it exists to-day, is said by the Japanese to serve three purposes: it\r\nmakes the children of both sexes loyal to the imperial family, it\r\ninterests the girls in housekeeping, and it trains them in ceremonial\r\netiquette.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 40._\r\n\r\nBecause of the complexity of the Chinese language and the time needed\r\nfor its mastery, there has been a movement to lessen the study of pure\r\nChinese in the government schools, or abolish it altogether, and with\r\nthis to simplify the use of the ideographs in the Sinico-Japanese. The\r\neducational department is requiring that text-books be limited in their\r\nuse of ideographs; that those used be written in only one way and that\r\nthe simplest, and that the _kana_ (the Japanese syllabary) be\r\nsubstituted wherever possible. Several plans for reform in this matter\r\nare being agitated, one of which is to limit the use of ideographs to\r\nnouns and verbs only.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 41._\r\n\r\nNo one who has been in Japan can have failed to notice the peculiarly\r\nstrident quality of the Japanese voice in singing, a quality that is\r\ngained by professional singers through much labor and actual physical\r\nsuffering. That this is not a natural characteristic of the Japanese\r\nvoice is shown by the fact that in speaking, the voices, both of\r\nchildren and adults, are low and sweet. It seems to me to be brought\r\nabout by the pursuit of a wrong musical ideal, or at least, of a musical\r\nideal quite distinct from that of the Western world. In Japan one seldom\r\nfinds singing birds kept in cages, but instead crickets, grasshoppers,\r\nkatydids, and other noisy members of the insect family may be seen\r\nexposed for sale in the daintiest of cages any summer night in the\r\nT[=o]ky[=o] streets. These insects delight the ears of the Japanese with\r\ntheir melody, and it seems to me that the voices of singers throughout\r\nthe empire are modeled after the shrill, rattling chirp of the insect,\r\nrather than after the fuller notes of the bird's song.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of European music by the schools and churches has\r\nalready begun to show in the songs of the children in the streets, and\r\nwhere ten years ago one might live in T[=o]ky[=o] for a year, and never\r\nhear a note of music except the semi-musical cries of the workmen, when\r\nthey are pulling or striking in concert, now there are few days when\r\nsome strain of song from some passing school-child does not come in at\r\nthe window of one's house in any quarter of the city. The progress made\r\nin catching foreign ideas of time and tune is quite surprising, but the\r\nsinging will never be acceptable to the foreign ear until the voice is\r\nmodulated according to the foreign standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 45._\r\n\r\nIt is said by Japanese versed in the most refined ways that a woman who\r\nhas learned the tea ceremony thoroughly is easily known by her superior\r\nbearing and manner on all occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 49._\r\n\r\nWhatever plant she begins with is taken up in a series of\r\nstudies,--leaves, flowers, roots, and stalks being shown in every\r\npossible position and combination,--until not only the stroke is\r\nmastered, but the plant is thoroughly known. In the book that lies\r\nbefore me as I write, a book used as a copy-book by a young lady\r\nbeginning the practice of the art, the teacher has devoted six large\r\npages to studies of one small and simple flower and the pupil has\r\ncovered hundreds of sheets of paper with efforts to imitate the designs.\r\nShe has now finished that part of the course, and can, at a moment's\r\nnotice, reproduce with just the right strokes any of the designs or any\r\npart of the plant. The next step forward will be a similar series of\r\nbamboo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 52._\r\n\r\nIn the government schools for girls, much attention is paid just now to\r\nphysical culture. The gymnastic exercises rank with the Chinese and\r\nEnglish and mathematics as important parts of the course, and the girls\r\nare encouraged to spend their recesses out-of-doors, engaging in all\r\nkinds of athletic sports. Races, ball games, tugs-of-war, marches, and\r\nquadrilles are entered into with zest and enjoyment, and the girls in\r\ntheir dark red _hakama_ are as well able to move quickly and freely as\r\ngirls of the same age in America. If it were not for the queer\r\npigeon-toed gait, acquired by years of walking in narrow _kimono_ and on\r\nhigh clogs, the Japanese girls would be fully abreast of the American in\r\nall these sports. So strongly has the idea of the necessity for physical\r\nstrength seized upon the nation, that a girl of delicate physique has\r\nless chance of marriage than one who is robust and strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 55._\r\n\r\nIt is in the mistakes and failures made in adapting the education given\r\nin the schools to the exact conditions that present themselves in the\r\nconstantly changing Japan of to-day, that the opponents of all\r\nalteration in the education of women find their strongest arguments. The\r\nconservatives point with scorn to this girl whose new ideas have led\r\nher into folly or trouble, or to that one whose health has been broken\r\ndown by the adverse conditions surrounding her student life, and say,\r\n\"This will be the case with all our women if we continue this insane\r\npractice of educating them along new lines.\" Advance in female\r\neducation, as in all other lines of progress in Japan, is a series of\r\nviolent actions and reactions. In 1889, partly through ill-advised\r\nconduct on the part of supporters of the cause, one of the most serious\r\nreverses that has come in the progress of Western education for women\r\nbegan to show itself. The reaction was helped along by a paper read\r\nbefore some of the most influential men of Japan, and subsequently\r\nreported and discussed in the newspapers, by a German professor in the\r\nmedical department of the imperial University in T[=o]ky[=o]. The paper\r\nwas a serious warning to the men of the country that no women could be\r\ngood wives, mothers, and housekeepers and at the same time have\r\nundergone a thorough literary education. The arguments were reinforced\r\nby statistics showing that American college women either did not marry,\r\nor that if they married they had very few children. All Japan took\r\nfright at this alarming showing, and for several years the education of\r\ngirls in anything more than the primary studies was not encouraged by\r\nthe government. The lowest depth of this reaction was reached during or\r\nsoon after the Japan-China war, when the growth of national vanity\r\nresulted in a temporary disdain for all foreign ideas. The tide has\r\nturned again now, girls' schools that have been closed for years are\r\nbeing reopened, young men who are thinking of marrying are looking for\r\neducated wives, and among the women themselves there is a strong desire\r\nfor self-improvement. Under this impulse a new generation of educated\r\nwomen will be added to those already exerting an influence in the\r\ncountry, and it is to be hoped that the forward movement will be more\r\ndifficult to set back when the next reactionary wave strikes the\r\nJapanese coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 60._\r\n\r\nThe _obi_ is supposed to express by its length the hope that the\r\nmarriage may be an enduring one. Among the more modernized Japanese a\r\nring is now often given in place of, or, in the wealthier classes, in\r\naddition to the _obi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 61, line 6._\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, however, as a sign of the times, to notice that for\r\nthe wedding of the Crown Prince, in May, 1900, the Shinto high priest,\r\nwho is master of ceremonies at the Imperial Court, instituted a solemn\r\nreligious ceremony within the sanctuary of the palace. Following the\r\nexample set in so high a quarter, a number of couples, during the winter\r\nof 1900-1901, have repaired to Shinto temples in various parts of the\r\nempire, to secure the sanction of the ancient national faith upon their\r\nunion. But still, for the great majority of the Japanese, the wedding\r\nceremony is what it has always been.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 61, line 15._\r\n\r\nAlthough new methods of transportation have come into use now in most of\r\nthe Japanese cities, and wheeled carts drawn by men or horses are used\r\nfor carrying all other kinds of luggage, the wedding outfit, wrapped in\r\ngreat cloths on which the crest of the bride's family is conspicuous, is\r\nborne on men's shoulders to the bridegroom's home, the length of the\r\nbaggage train and the number and size of the burdens showing the wealth\r\nand importance of the bride's family. The bride who goes to her\r\nhusband's house well provided by her own family, will carry, not only a\r\nfull wardrobe and the house-furnishings already mentioned, but will be\r\nsupplied, so far as foresight can manage it, with all the little things\r\nthat she can need for months in advance. Paper, pens, ink, postage\r\nstamps, needles, thread, and sewing materials of all kinds, a store of\r\ndress materials and other things to be given as presents to any and all\r\nwho may do her favors, and pocket money with which she may make good any\r\ndeficiencies, or meet any unforeseen emergency. When she goes from her\r\nfather's house, she should be so thoroughly fitted out that she will not\r\nhave to ask her husband for the smallest thing for a number of months.\r\nThe parents of the bride, in giving up their daughter, as they do when\r\nshe marries, show the estimation in which they have held her by the\r\nbeauty and completeness of the trousseau with which they provide her.\r\nThe expense of this wedding outfit is often very great, persons even in\r\nthe most moderate circumstances spending as much as one thousand yen\r\nupon the necessary purchases, and among the wealthy, four thousand to\r\nfive thousand yen is not extravagant. As material wealth increases in\r\nJapan, there is a marked tendency to increase the style and cost of the\r\ntrousseau, and the marriage of a daughter has come to be, in many cases,\r\na severe strain on the family finances. But this outfit is of the nature\r\nof a dowry, for it is her very own; and in the event of a divorce, she\r\nbrings back with her to her father's house the clothing and household\r\ngoods that she carried away as a bride.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 64._\r\n\r\nFor this visit the bride wears for the first time a dress made for her\r\nby her husband's family and bearing its crest, as a sign that she is\r\nnow a member of that family and only a guest in her father's house.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 76._\r\n\r\nSince the adoption of the new code, the conditions of marriage and of\r\ndivorce have been altered for the better. At present no divorce is\r\npossible except through the courts or through mutual consent; the simple\r\nchange of registration by one party or the other does not constitute a\r\nlegal divorce. Even a divorce by mutual consent cannot be arranged\r\nwithout the consent of the parents or head of the family of a married\r\nperson who is under twenty-five years of age. The grounds upon which\r\njudicial divorce may be granted seem very trivial measured by European\r\nstandards, but, on the other hand, they are a distinct gain over the\r\nformer practice. The wife is no longer dependent for her position simply\r\nupon the whim of her husband, but, unless he can secure her consent to\r\nthe separation, he must formulate charges of immorality or conviction of\r\ncrime, or of cruel treatment or grave insult on the part of the wife or\r\nof her relatives, or of desertion, or of disappearance for a period of\r\nthree years or more. Only when some such charge has been made and proved\r\nbefore a court can a husband send away his wife. In the case of a\r\nseparation by mutual consent, though the law still gives the care of the\r\nchildren to the father in case no previous agreement has been made, if a\r\nwoman sees her way clear to supporting them, she may stipulate for the\r\ncustody of one or more of them as a condition of her consent to the\r\ndivorce. In a judicial divorce, the judge may, in the interests of the\r\nchildren, take them away from their father and assign them to the care\r\nof some other person.\r\n\r\nIn these changes we can see a distinct advance toward permanence of the\r\nfamily tie; and we can see, too, that the wife has gained a new power to\r\nhold her own against injustice and wrong. That when the people have\r\nbecome used to these changes, other and more binding laws will be\r\nenacted, we can feel pretty sure, for the drift of enlightened public\r\nopinion seems to be in favor of securing better and more firmly\r\nestablished homes just as fast as \"the hardness of their hearts\" will\r\npermit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 84._\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us in America, who live under customs and laws in\r\nwhich the individual is the social unit and the family a union of\r\nindividuals, to understand a system of society in which the individual\r\nis little or nothing and the family the social unit recognized both by\r\nlaw and custom. In Japan, a man is simply a member of some family, and\r\nhis daily affairs, his marrying and giving in marriage, are more or less\r\nunder the control of the head of his family, or of the family council.\r\nOnly in case he is the head of the family is he able to marry without\r\nsecuring some one's consent, and then his responsibilities in regard to\r\nthe headship may in themselves hamper him. If this is the case with the\r\nmore independent man, it may be imagined how completely the woman is\r\nsubmerged under family influence. She may, under exceptional\r\ncircumstances, become the head of a family, but this is usually only a\r\ntemporary expedient, and even then she must subordinate herself more\r\ncompletely to the family and its interests than when she occupies a\r\nlowlier place.\r\n\r\nThe headship of an unmarried woman lasts only until a husband has been\r\nselected for her, and the headship of a widow lasts during her\r\nguardianship of the rightful heir to the position. By Japanese law a\r\nwidow is always the guardian of her minor children.\r\n\r\nThe only way in which individuality before the law can be obtained by\r\nman or woman in Japan is through cutting the tie that binds to the\r\nfamily, and starting out in life afresh as the head of a new family.\r\nThis new family must always be _héimin_, or plebeian, no matter how high\r\nin rank may have been the family from which the founder has gone out,\r\nbut there is a continually increasing number of young men and women who\r\nprefer the freedom that comes from the headship of a small and new\r\nfamily, even if of low rank, to the state of tutelage or of hampering\r\nresponsibility which must accompany connection with a larger and older\r\nsocial group. It seems likely that through this means an evolution from\r\nthe family to the individual system will be effected, as the nation\r\ngrows more and more modernized in its way of looking at things.\r\n\r\nFor the Japanese woman, as I have already said, marriage is in most\r\ncases the entrance into a new family. She is cut off from the old ways\r\nand interests, in which she has until now had her part, and she has\r\nbegun life anew as the latest addition to and therefore the lowest and\r\nmost ignorant member of another social group. It is her duty simply to\r\nlearn the ways and obey the will of those above her, and it is the duty\r\nof those above her, and especially of her husband's mother, to fit her\r\nby training and discipline for her new surroundings. The physical\r\nstrength of the young wife, her sweetness of temper, her manners, her\r\nmorals, her way of looking at life, are all put to the test by this\r\nsharp-eyed guardian of the family interests, and woe to the younger\r\nwoman if she fail to come up to the standard set. She may be a good\r\nwoman and a faithful wife, but if, under the training given her, she\r\ndoes not adapt herself readily to the traditions and customs of the\r\nfamily she enters, it is more than likely, even under the new laws, that\r\nshe may be sent back to her father's house as _persona non grata_, and\r\neven her husband's love cannot save her. It is because of this\r\npredominance of the family over the individual that the young wife, when\r\nshe enters her husband's home, is not, as in our own country, entering\r\nupon a new life as mistress of a house, with absolute control over all\r\nof her little domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 115._\r\n\r\nAt the time of the celebration of his silver wedding, in 1895, the\r\nEmperor came into the Audience Room with the Empress on his arm, an\r\nexample which was followed by the Imperial Princes.\r\n\r\nWith the engagement and marriage of the Crown Prince, in May, 1900, an\r\nentirely new precedent was established in the relations of the Imperial\r\ncouple. The Western idea of marriage between equals has never existed in\r\nthe Japanese mind in its thought of the union between their Emperor and\r\nEmpress. The Empress, though of noble family, was chosen from among the\r\nsubjects of the Emperor, and the marriage was of the nature of an\r\nappointment by the Emperor to the position of Imperial Consort, just as\r\nany other appointment might have been made of a subject to fill an\r\nimportant position in the government. In the marriage of the Crown\r\nPrince a very different course was pursued. While no departure was made\r\nfrom the old precedents in the selection of a Princess from one of the\r\nfive families that trace their descent from Jimmu Tenno, the whole\r\nmanner of obtaining the bride was different from anything that Japan had\r\nbefore known. The Prince asked the father of the young lady to give her\r\nto him just as a common man might have done, and everything in the\r\npreliminary arrangements was carried out with the idea that by the\r\nmarriage she was to be raised to his rank and position. Reference has\r\nalready been made to the religious ceremony that was devised for the\r\noccasion, an act that in itself altered the meaning of marriage for the\r\nwhole nation.\r\n\r\nSince the wedding, rumors have floated to the world outside of the\r\npalace gates, of the kindness and consideration with which the young\r\nwife is treated by her husband. To the scandal of some of the more\r\nold-fashioned of the Prince's attendants, the heir to the throne insists\r\non observing toward his wife, in private as well as in public, all the\r\nminutiæ of Western etiquette. She enters the carriage ahead of him when\r\nthey drive together, they habitually take their meals together, and he\r\nfinds in her a cheerful companion and friend, and not simply a devoted\r\nand humble servant. In this way, by the highest example that can be set\r\nto them, the Japanese people are learning a new lesson.\r\n\r\nAll these things have a deep significance in showing that the sacredness\r\nof the marriage tie is gradually being recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 137._\r\n\r\nSomething, indeed, may be said on the other side in regard to this\r\nsystem, which I seem to have painted as ideal. If in America we find the\r\nburden of expensive grown-up sons and daughters sometimes too heavy upon\r\nparents whose powers are on the wane, we must remember that in Japan a\r\nyoung man is often seriously handicapped at the beginning of his active\r\nlife by the early retirement of his father from self-supporting labor,\r\nand that the young wife entering the home of her parents-in-law often\r\nfinds a happy married life rendered impossible by the fact that she must\r\nplease an elderly couple thoroughly fixed in their ways,--the rulers of\r\nthe household and with little to do but rule. With this custom, as with\r\nall human customs, everything in the long run depends upon how it is\r\nused, and without deep affection between parents and children there\r\nseems to be as much danger from the serious handicapping of the rising\r\ngeneration by selfish and inconsiderate parents in Japan, as there is in\r\nAmerica of the wearing out of the older people's lives and strength in\r\nthe service of ungrateful and lazy children.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 152._\r\n\r\nThe bed on which the Empress sleeps is made of heavy _futons_, or\r\nquilts, of white _habutai_ wadded with silk wadding. The bedclothing\r\nconsists of as many similar _futons_ as the state of the weather may\r\nrequire. Every month new _futons_ are provided for Her Majesty, and the\r\ndiscarded ones are given to one of her attendants. The happy recipient\r\nis thus provided with wadding enough for all her winter dresses for the\r\nrest of her life, as well as with a good supply of dress material.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 157._\r\n\r\nOnly those who have seen the inner life of the court can realize the\r\ndifficulties which have attended every step of the Empress Haru's way,\r\nfor the court has been the scene of great struggles between the\r\nconservative and radical elements. Mean and petty jealousies have moved\r\nthose surrounding the throne. The slightest word or token from the\r\nEmpress would be used as a weapon for private ends. To move among these\r\nvaried and discordant factions, and to move for progress, without\r\ncausing undue friction, has been a task more difficult than the conquest\r\nof armies, and to do so successfully has required almost infinite\r\npatience, sympathy, and love.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 168._\r\n\r\nAnd now, after thirty-three years of the enlightened rule of the present\r\nEmperor, and of the beneficent life and example of the Empress Haru, is\r\nthere any assurance that the progress made during their occupation of\r\nthe throne will be continued in the lives of Japan's future rulers?\r\n\r\nPrince Haru, or Yoshihito, is now a man twenty-two years of age, with\r\ncharacter sufficiently developed to be used as the basis for a guess at\r\nwhat his qualities as a sovereign may prove to be. \"As far as the East\r\nis from the West\" have his life and education been from the life and\r\neducation of his illustrious father. Instead of the curtained seclusion,\r\nthe quiet and calm of the old palace in the old capital, the present\r\nCrown Prince has known from babyhood the sights and sounds of the\r\nstirring city of T[=o]ky[=o]. He has driven in an open carriage or walked\r\nthrough its streets; he has been to school with boys of his own age,\r\ntaking the school work and the drill and the games with the other boys,\r\nlearning to know men and things and himself too, in a way in which none\r\nof his ancestors, since the days when they were simply savage chiefs,\r\nhave had opportunity of knowing. As he grew toward manhood, his delicate\r\nhealth required that he leave the school and pursue his studies as his\r\nstrength permitted, under masters; but he has retained his love for all\r\nathletic exercises, for dogs and horses and guns and bicycles, and he is\r\nas expert in outdoor sports as any youth of Western training. His mind\r\nis quick and eager, interested especially in foreign ways and thoughts,\r\nand seeking most of all to understand how other people think and feel\r\nand live. Though he has been emancipated to a wonderful degree from the\r\nstate and ceremony that surrounded his ancestors, he is nevertheless\r\nimpatient of what remains, and would gladly dispense with many forms\r\nthat his conservative guardians regard as necessary; and these same\r\nguardians at times find their young eaglet difficult to manage. He has\r\nviews and ideas of his own, and acts occasionally upon his own\r\ninitiative in a way that fairly scandalizes his advisers. He wishes to\r\nvisit his future subjects upon something like equal terms. The rôle of\r\nSon of Heaven seems to him less interesting at times than some smaller\r\nand more human part. When he walks, he wants to lead his own dog, not\r\nhave him led by some one else; to stop in the street and watch the\r\ncommon people at their work; to drop in on his friends in a neighborly\r\nway and see how they live when they are not expecting a visit from\r\nroyalty. Provided he does not go too fast or too far, when his turn\r\ncomes to ascend the throne, he cannot but make a better emperor for the\r\nintimate personal knowledge that he is seeking and gaining of the lives\r\nand feelings of his people.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Princess Sada, who has now been for one year in the line of\r\nsuccession to the present beloved Empress, shows in her training and\r\ncharacter the influence of the new impulse that is driving Japan\r\nforward. The circumstances that led to her selection as the bride of the\r\nPrince are in themselves curious enough to be worth recording. The Kujo\r\nfamily is one of the five families from which alone can the wife of the\r\nCrown Prince be chosen, and the present Prince Kujo is blessed with many\r\ndaughters. Of these, the oldest is about the age of Prince Haru, and at\r\none time it was hoped that she might be selected as his consort, but at\r\nlast that hope was given up, and she was married to another prince. The\r\nsecond daughter was as bright and charming as the first, but she was\r\njust enough younger than the Prince to make her marriage with him so\r\ndangerous a matter according to all the rules that govern good and bad\r\nluck in Japan, that no hope was entertained for her, and she was\r\nmarried, when her time came, with no reference to the greatest match\r\nthat any Japanese princess can make. The third daughter was six years\r\nyounger than the Prince, so much younger that it was thought that he\r\nwould be married long before she grew up, so no special care or\r\nattention was given to her. In her babyhood, like most Japanese babies\r\nof high rank, she was sent out into the country to be nursed. Her foster\r\nparents were plain farmer folk, who loved her and cared for her as their\r\nown child. She played bareheaded and barefooted in the sun and wind,\r\ntumbled about, jolly and happy, with the village children, and lived and\r\ngrew like a kitten or a puppy rather than like a future empress until\r\nshe was old enough for the kindergarten. Then she came back to\r\nT[=o]ky[=o], to her father's house, and from there she attended the\r\nPeeresses' School, going backward and forward every day with her bundle\r\nof books, and taking her share of the work and play with the other\r\nchildren. In her school-days she was noticeable for her great physical\r\nactivity and her hearty enjoyment of the outdoor sports which form so\r\nimportant a part of the training in Japanese schools for girls at\r\npresent; and for her strength of will and character among a class of\r\nstudents upon whom self-repression amounting almost to self-abnegation\r\nhas been inculcated from earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nWhen this little princess reached the age of fifteen, the Crown Prince's\r\nmarriage, which had been somewhat deferred on account of his ill-health,\r\nwas pressed forward, and to the extreme surprise of her own family, and\r\nof many others as well, the Princess Sada was chosen, largely on account\r\nof her great physical vigor. Then began a great change in her life. From\r\nbeing one of the lowest and least considered in her family, she was\r\nsuddenly raised high above all the rest, even her father addressing her\r\nas a superior. The merry, romping school-girl was transformed in a few\r\ndays into the great lady, too grand to associate on equal terms with any\r\nbut the imperial family. Small cause was there for wonder if she shrank\r\nfrom the change and begged that the honor might be bestowed on some one\r\nelse. The old free life was gone forever, and she dreaded the heavy\r\nresponsibility that was to fall upon her slender shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe choice was made in August, 1899, and from the moment that the\r\nengagement was entered into, the Princess Sada became an honored guest\r\nin her father's house. She could no longer play with her brothers and\r\nsisters, or take a meal with any member of her own family. A new and\r\nhandsome suite of rooms was built for her, her old wardrobe was\r\ndiscarded and an entirely new one provided for her, all her table\r\nservice was new and distinct from that of the rest of the family, and\r\nshe was addressed by all as if she were already Empress. Her studies\r\nwere not given up, but masters were chosen for her who came to her and\r\ninstructed her, with due deference to her high station, in the subjects\r\nthat she had been studying at school. So passed the nine months of her\r\nengagement, and on May 8, 1900, she became one of the principals in a\r\nstate wedding such as Japan had never before seen. Through all the show\r\nand ceremony she acquitted herself decorously and bravely, and since her\r\nmarriage no word save of approval of the young wife has come out from\r\nthe palace gates. Her little sisters-in-law, the four small daughters of\r\nthe Emperor, enjoy nothing so much as to go and spend the day with her,\r\nfor she is so amusing, and her life has been such a busy and happy one,\r\nthat she comes like a breath of fresh air into the seclusion of the\r\nCourt. Her young husband, too, finds in her congenial society, and his\r\nfrail health seems to be daily strengthening with the brightness that\r\nhas come into his home.\r\n\r\nGreat was the joy in the empire when, on April 29, 1901, this happy\r\nunion was rendered still happier by the birth of a strong little prince\r\nto carry on the ancient line. By an auspicious coincidence, his birth\r\ncame just at the time of the annual boys' feast, or Feast of Flags, and\r\nhis naming day was appointed for May 5, the great day of the feast, when\r\nall Japan is decorated with giant carp swinging from tall poles outside\r\nof every house, and swimming vigorously at the ends of their tethers in\r\nthe strong spring wind. The carp is to the Japanese mind the emblem of\r\ncourage and perseverance, for he swims up the strongest current, leaping\r\nthe waterfalls that oppose his progress. The baby was named by his\r\ngrandfather, and will have the personal name of Hirohito, and the title\r\nPrince Michi. With this new little prince there are no polite fictions\r\nto maintain, nor conventional relationships to be established. He is the\r\nson of his father's lawful wife, as well as of his father. There is to\r\nbe no breaking off of natural ties, and his own mother will nurse and\r\ncare for him, a fortune that never falls to the lot of the imperial son\r\nof a _mékaké_. If he lives, he will be a standing argument in favor of\r\nmonogamy, even in noble families, and his birth bodes well for family\r\nlife throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 182._\r\n\r\nA pretty, but most shocking sight, if seen through the eyes of some of\r\nthese old-fashioned attendants, is the semi-annual _undo kai_, or\r\nexercise day of the Peeresses' School. The large playground is, for\r\nthis occasion, surrounded by seats divided off to accommodate invited\r\nguests of various ranks, who spend the day watching the entertainment.\r\nIn the most honorable place, surrounded by her ladies-in-waiting, sits\r\nthe Empress herself, for the education of the daughters of the nobles is\r\na matter of the liveliest interest to her; and the parents and friends\r\nand teachers of the girls fill up all available seats after the school\r\nitself has been accommodated.\r\n\r\nThe programme is usually a long one, occupying the greater part of the\r\nmorning and afternoon, with an interval for lunch. Most of the ordinary\r\nEnglish field games--tennis, basket-ball, etc.--are played with skill\r\nand vigor, and in addition to these there are races of various kinds,\r\ndevised to show, not simply fleetness of foot, but quickness of hand and\r\nwit as well. These races vary from year to year, as the ingenuity of the\r\ndirectors of the sports may be able to devise new forms of exercise. One\r\nextremely pretty contest is as follows: On the playground between the\r\nstarting-point and the goal are set at equal distances four upright\r\nsticks for each runner. Four branches of cherry blossoms and four\r\nbright-colored ribbons for each contestant are laid on the ground at the\r\nstarting-point. At the signal, each girl picks up a cherry branch and a\r\nribbon, and runs to one of the upright sticks, tying the flowers firmly\r\nthereto; then she runs back for a second branch, and so on until all\r\nfour have been fastened in place. The race is won by the child who first\r\nreaches the goal leaving behind her four blooming trees where before\r\nthere were bare poles. This seems to be the æsthetic Japanese equivalent\r\nfor our prosaic potato race. Another contest is after this manner: Along\r\nthe course of each runner are laid at certain intervals bright-colored\r\nballs,--a different color for each contestant. The object of the race\r\nis, within a certain time, to pick up all the balls and throw them into\r\nthe nearly closed mouth of a great net at the far end of the grounds.\r\nThe contest is not decided until the balls have been counted, when the\r\ngirl who has succeeded in getting the greatest number of balls of her\r\ncolor into the net is declared the winner. Another and extremely pretty\r\nrace, calling for great steadiness of hand and body, is the running from\r\none end of the ground to the other with a ball balanced on a battledore.\r\nThe Japanese battledore is made of light but hard wood, and is long and\r\nnarrow in shape. If one had not seen it done, it would be well-nigh\r\nimpossible to believe that any child could carry a ball upon it for more\r\nthan a few slow steps: but these children run at a smart trot, keeping\r\nthe ball immovable upon its small and smooth surface.\r\n\r\nBeside the games and races, there are calisthenic exhibitions, in which\r\ngreat precision of motion and flexibility of body are manifested. One of\r\nthe most graceful and attractive of these is the fan drill shown on this\r\noccasion, when some twenty or thirty girls, with their bright-colored\r\ndresses, long, waving sleeves, and red _hakama_, posture in perfect\r\nrhythm, with fans opened or closed, waving above the head, held before\r\nthe face, changed from position to position, with the performers'\r\nchanges of attitude, each new figure seemingly more graceful than the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nIn these and many other ways the nobility of new Japan are being fitted\r\nfor the new part that they have to play in the world. No wonder that the\r\neducation now given, awakening the mind, toughening the body, arousing\r\nambition and individuality, is regarded by many of the ultra-conservatives\r\nas a dangerous innovation, and one likely to bring the nobility down to\r\nthe level of the common people. Whether this new education is better or\r\nworse than the old, we can hardly tell as yet, but there are no signs of\r\nthe immediate breakdown of the old spirit of the nobility, and the\r\nbetter health and stronger characters of the young women who have\r\nreceived the modern training promise much for the next generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 192._\r\n\r\nWhile this was entirely true in 1890, it is interesting to observe that\r\nafter ten years of commercial and industrial progress there are signs\r\nthat the embroidered kimono is coming back into fashion. With the growth\r\nof large fortunes and of luxury that has marked the past decade, has\r\ncome the custom of providing wedding garments as magnificently\r\nembroidered as were the robes of the daimi[=o]s' ladies, and even the\r\n_montsuki_ or ceremonial dress, which was severely plain in 1890, now\r\nhas little delicate embroidery about the bottom. It will not be\r\nsurprising if some day, when the present growing commercial and\r\nindustrial enterprise has reaped a more abundant harvest, Japan blooms\r\nforth again in the beautiful garments that went out of fashion when the\r\ngreat political upheaval cut off the revenues of the old nobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 209._\r\n\r\nAt each encroachment of the enemy those of the population who could not\r\nfind refuge at once within the inner defenses were driven to choose\r\nbetween surrender and self-inflicted death. The unconquerable samurai\r\nspirit flamed out in the choice of hundreds of women and children as\r\nwell as men, and whole families were wiped out of existence at once,\r\nthe little ones, who were too young to understand the proper method of\r\n_hara-kiri_, kneeling calmly with bowed heads for the death-stroke from\r\nfather or brother which should free them from the disgrace of defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 223._\r\n\r\nThat the spirit of the samurai women is still a living force in Japan,\r\nno one can doubt who listens to the stories of what the women did and\r\nbore in the Japan-China war of 1895. The old self-sacrifice and devotion\r\nshowed itself throughout the country in deeds of real, if sometimes\r\nmistaken, heroism. Husbands, sons, and brothers were sent out to danger\r\nand death with smiles and cheerful words, by women dependent upon them\r\nfor everything in a way that can hardly be understood by Americans. Even\r\ntears of grief for the dear ones offered in the country's cause were\r\nsuppressed as disloyal, and women learned with unmoved countenances of\r\nthe death of those they loved best, and found the courage to express, in\r\nthe first shock of bereavement, their sense of the honor conferred on\r\nthe family by the death of one of its members in the cause of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nA few incidents quoted from an article by Miss Umé Tsuda that appeared\r\nin the New York \"Independent\" in 1895 will give my readers an idea of\r\nthe forms that this devotion assumed:--\r\n\r\n\"One instance comes into my mind of an old lady who sent out cheerfully\r\nand with a smiling face her young and only son, the sole stay of her old\r\nage. Left a widow while young, she had lived a life of much sorrow and\r\ntrouble, and had with almost superhuman efforts managed to give her son\r\nan education that would start him in life. It was only a few years ago\r\nthat the son had begun to help in the family support, and to be able to\r\nrepay to the mother her tender care of him. Her pride in her son and his\r\nyoung wife was a pleasure to see, and the little home they had together\r\nseemed a safe haven for the coming years of old age. Now, in a moment\r\nall this was changed,--the son must start off for the wars. Yet not for\r\none instant was a cloud seen on the mother's face, as, smilingly and\r\ncheerfully, she assisted in the preparations for his departure. Not in\r\npublic or in secret did one sigh or regret escape her; not even to the\r\nson did a word of anxiety pass her lips. Her face, beaming with joy,\r\nlooked with pride on the manly strength of the young soldier as he\r\nstarted to fight for his country and win honor for himself,--honor which\r\nwould surely come to him whether he lived or died.\r\n\r\n\"Another woman who is well on in years, and whose eldest son is a naval\r\nofficer, furnishes an interesting example of mother love. Though never\r\nshowing her anxiety on his account, or grief at his danger, she has\r\ntaken upon herself, in spite of her old age and by no means vigorous\r\nhealth, to go on foot every morning to one of the temples and worship\r\nthere before daylight, in order to propitiate the gods, that they may\r\nprotect her son. She arises at four o'clock in the morning on the\r\ncoldest of cold days, washes and purifies herself with ice-cold water,\r\nand then starts out before daylight for her three-mile walk to the\r\ntemple. Thus through wind and storm and cold have the faith and love of\r\nthis old woman upheld her, and one is happy to add that so far her\r\nprayers have been heard and no harm has come to the one she has called\r\non her gods to protect.\r\n\r\n\"A touching story is told of the aged mother of Sakamoto, commander of\r\nthe warship Akagi, who was killed in the thickest of the fight during\r\nthe great naval battle of the Yellow Sea. Commander Sakamoto left an\r\naged mother, a wife, and three children. As soon as his death was\r\nofficially ascertained, a messenger was dispatched from the naval\r\ndepartment to convey the sad tidings to his family. The communication\r\nwas made duly to his wife, and before the messenger had left the house\r\nit reached the ears of the old mother, who, tottering into the room\r\nwhere the officer was, saluted and greeted him duly, and then, with dry\r\neyes and a clear voice, said, 'So it seems by your tidings that my son\r\nhas been of some service this time.'\r\n\r\n\"One reads pathetic stories in the newspapers daily in connection with\r\nthe war. Not long ago a sad account was given of a young woman, just\r\npast her twentieth year, and only recently married to an army officer.\r\nShe had belonged by birth to a military family, and, as befitted the\r\nwife and daughter of a soldier, she resolved, on hearing of the death of\r\nher husband, that she would not survive him, but would follow him to the\r\ngreat unknown. Sending away her servant on some excuse, she remained\r\nalone in her home, which she put into perfect order. Then she arranged\r\nall her papers, wrote a number of letters, and made her last\r\npreparations for death. She dressed herself in full ceremonial dress as\r\nshe had been dressed for her bridal, and seated herself before a large\r\nportrait of her husband. Then, with a short dirk, such as is owned by\r\nevery samurai woman, she stabbed herself. In her last letters she gives\r\nas the reason for her death that, having no ties in the world, she would\r\nnot survive her husband, but wished to remain faithful to him in death\r\nas she had been in life.\r\n\r\n\"Many such stories might be cited, but enough has been given to show the\r\nspirit that exists in Japan. With such women and such teachings in\r\ntheir homes, can it be wondered at that Japan is a brave nation, and\r\nthat her soldiers are winning battles? Certainly some of the honor and\r\ncredit must be given to these wives and mothers scattered throughout\r\nJapan, who are surely, in some cases, the inspirers of that courage and\r\nspirit which is just now surprising the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 239._\r\n\r\nMuch surprise is evinced by foreigners visiting Japan at the lack of\r\ntaste shown by the Japanese in the imitation of foreign styles. And yet,\r\nfor these same foreigners, who condemn so patronizingly the Japanese\r\nlack of taste in foreign things, the Japanese manufacture pottery, fans,\r\nscrolls, screens, etc., that are most excruciating to their sense of\r\nbeauty, and export them to markets in which they find a ready sale,\r\ntheir manufacturers wondering, the while, why foreigners want such ugly\r\nthings. The fact is that neither civilization has as yet come into any\r\nunderstanding of the other's æsthetic side, and the sense of beauty of\r\nthe one is a sealed book to the other. The Japanese nation, in its\r\nefforts to adopt foreign ways, has been, up to the present time, blindly\r\nimitating, with little or no comprehension of underlying principles. As\r\na result there is an absolute crudeness in foreign things as attempted\r\nin Japan that grates on the nerves of travelers fresh from the best to\r\nbe found in Europe or America.\r\n\r\nThere are signs, however, that the stage of imitation is past and that\r\nadaptation has begun. Here and there in T[=o]ky[=o] may be seen\r\nbuildings in which the solidity of foreign architecture has been grafted\r\nupon the Japanese type. Ten years ago, Japanese men who adopted foreign\r\ndress went about in misfitting garments, soiled linen, untidy shoes, and\r\nhats that had been discarded by the civilization for which they were\r\nmade many seasons before they reached Japan. They wore Turkish towels\r\nabout their necks and red blankets over their shoulders at the desire of\r\nunscrupulous importers, who persuaded them that towels for neck-cloths\r\nand blankets for overcoats were the latest styles of London and Paris.\r\nTo-day one sees no such eccentricities of costume in the purely Japanese\r\ncity of T[=o]ky[=o]. Men who wear foreign dress wear it made correctly\r\nin every particular by Japanese tailors, shoemakers, and hatters. The\r\nstandard has been attained, for men at least, and in foreign dress as\r\nwell as in Japanese, the natural good taste of the people has begun to\r\nassert itself. So it will be in time with other new things adopted. As\r\nno single element of the Chinese civilization secured a permanent\r\nfooting in Japan except such as could be adapted, not only to the\r\nnational life, but to the national taste as well, so it will be with\r\nEuropean things. All things that are adopted will be adapted, and\r\nwhatever is adapted is likely in time to be improved and made more\r\nbeautiful by the national instinct for beauty. During the transition,\r\nenormities are omitted and monstrosities are constructed, but when the\r\nstandard is at last attained, we may expect that the genius of the race\r\nwill triumph over the difficulties that it is now encountering.\r\nIndividual Japanese who have lived long in Europe or America show the\r\nsame nice discrimination in regard to foreign things that they do in\r\ntheir Japanese surroundings, and are rarely at fault in their taste.\r\nWhat is true of the individual now will be true of the nation when\r\nEuropean standards have become common property.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 242._\r\n\r\nIn the remote mountain regions, where the majesty and uncertainty of the\r\ngreat natural forces impress themselves constantly upon the minds of the\r\npeasantry, one finds a simple nature worship, and a desire to propitiate\r\nall the unseen powers, that is not so evident in the daily life of the\r\ndwellers in more populous and progressive parts of the country. As the\r\nmountains close in about the road that runs up from the plains below, a\r\ngreat stone, on which is deeply carved \"To the God of the Mountains,\"\r\ncalls the attention of the traveler to the fact that the supernatural is\r\na recognized power among the mountaineers. In such regions one finds\r\nthe stated offerings at the shrines which stand near the wayside kept\r\nconstantly renewed. Nearly every house is protected by some slip of\r\npaper pasted above the door, a charm obtained by toilsome pilgrimage to\r\nsome noted temple. Behind or near the village temple one may see rude\r\nwigwams of straw, each sheltering a _gohei_,[45]--witnesses to the vows\r\nof devotees who hope, sooner or later, to erect small wooden shrines and\r\nso win favor from the unknown rulers of human destinies. In places where\r\npack-horses form a large part of the wealth of the people, stones to the\r\nhorses' spirits are erected, and the halters of all the horses that die\r\nare left upon these stones. Prayers, too, are offered to the guardian\r\nspirits of the living horses, before stones on which are carved\r\nsometimes the image of a horse bearing a _gohei_ on his back, sometimes\r\na rough figure of the horse-headed Kwannon. To such stones or shrines\r\nare brought horses suffering from sickness of any kind, and the hand is\r\nrubbed first on the stone and then on the part of the animal supposed to\r\nbe affected. In one district, when a horse epidemic broke out, its rapid\r\nspread was attributed by the authorities to this custom, and all persons\r\nwere warned of the danger, with what effect in breaking up the ancient\r\nhabit the newspaper reports failed to say. It is in such regions as this\r\nthat the _oni_ and the _tengu_[46] still live in the every-day thought\r\nof the people; it is here, too, that the old custom of offering flowers\r\nand fruit to the spirits of the dead at the midsummer festival is most\r\nconscientiously kept up. All possible spirits are included in these\r\nofferings, so that even by the roadside one finds bunches of flowers set\r\nup in the clefts of the rock, to the spirits of travelers who have died\r\non the way.\r\n\r\n[45] _Gohei_, a piece of white paper, cut and folded in a peculiar\r\nmanner, one of the sacred symbols of the Shint[=o] faith.\r\n\r\n[46] _Tengu_, a winged, long-nosed or beak-mouthed monster, supposed to\r\ninhabit the mountain regions of Japan. It was from a _tengu_ that\r\nYoshitsune, one of the greatest of Japanese heroes, learned to fence,\r\nand so became a swordsman of almost miraculous expertness. _Oni_, a\r\ndemon or goblin.\r\n\r\nIn one little mountain resort, far from the railroad but in touch with\r\nthe outside world through the hundreds of visitors that seek its hot\r\nbaths during the summer, it was my good fortune to spend a few weeks\r\nrecently. Our walks were rather limited in variety, as the village lay\r\nin an almost inaccessible mountain valley through which a carefully\r\nengineered road ran along the edge of the river gorge. About half a mile\r\nout of the village, close to the road and overhanging the waters of the\r\nriver at a spot where the rocks were so worn and carved by the rushing\r\ntorrent as to have gained the appropriate title of the \"Screen Rocks,\"\r\nwas a little shop and a tea-house. It was a pleasant resting-place after\r\na warm and dusty walk, and almost daily we would halt there for a cup of\r\ntea and a slice of _yokan_, or bean marmalade, before returning to our\r\nrooms in the hotel. The managers of the place were an old man and his\r\nwife, who divided their labor between the shop and the tea-house. The\r\nold man was an artist in roots. His life was devoted to searching out\r\ngrotesquely shaped roots on the forest-covered hills, and whittling,\r\nturning, and trimming them into the semblance of animal or human forms.\r\n_Tengu_ and goblins, long-legged birds and short-legged beasts, all\r\nmanner of weird products of his imagination and his handiwork, peopled\r\nthe interior of the little shop, and he was always ready to welcome us\r\nand show us his latest work, with the pride of an artist in his\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nHis wife, a cheery old woman, attended to the tea-house, and as soon as\r\nwe had seated ourselves, bustled about to bring us cool water from the\r\nspring that bubbled out of the rocks across the road, and to set before\r\nus the tiny cups of straw-colored tea and the delicious slices of\r\n_yokan_ which we soon learned was the specialty of the place. She was\r\nglad to have a little gossip as we sipped and nibbled, telling us many\r\ninteresting bits of folklore about the immediate locality. It was from\r\nher that we learned that the pinnacle of rock that dominated the village\r\nwas built by _tengu_ long ago, though now they were all gone from the\r\nwoods, for she had looked for them often at night when she went out to\r\nshut the house, but she had never seen one,--and even the monkeys were\r\nbecoming scarce. She it was, too, who sent us to look for the mysterious\r\ndraught of cold air that crossed the road near the base of the great\r\nrock, colder on hot days than on cool ones, and at all times\r\nastonishing,--the \"Tengu's Wind Hole.\" We learned through her about the\r\nsnakes to be found in the woods, and of the wonderful tonic virtues of\r\nthe _mamushi_ (the one poisonous snake of Japan), if caught and bottled\r\nwith a sufficient quantity of _saké_. The _saké_ may be renewed again\r\nand again, and the longer the snake has been bottled the more medicinal\r\ndoes it become, so that one _mamushi_ may, if used perseveringly,\r\nmedicate several casks of _saké_. We had opportunity later to verify her\r\nstatements, for we found at a small grocery store, where we stopped to\r\nadd a few delicacies to our somewhat scanty bill of fare, two snakes,\r\nneatly coiled in quart bottles and pickled in _saké_, one of which could\r\nbe obtained for the sum of seventy-five sen, though the other, who in\r\nhis rage at being bottled had buried his fangs in his own body,\r\ncommanded a higher price because of his courage. We did not feel in\r\nneed of a tonic that day, so left the _mamushi_ on the grocery shelves,\r\nbut it is probable that their disintegrating remains are being\r\nindustriously quaffed to-day by some elderly Japanese whose failing\r\nstrength demands an unfailing remedy.\r\n\r\nWhen our little friend had learned of our interest in snakes, she was on\r\nthe lookout for snake stories of all kinds. One day she stopped us as we\r\ncame by rather later than usual, hurrying home before a threatening\r\nshower, to tell us that we ought to have come a little sooner, for the\r\ngreat black snake who was the messenger of the god that lived on the\r\nmountain had just been by, and we might have been interested to see him.\r\nShe had seen him before, herself, so he was no novelty to her, but she\r\nwas sure that the matter would interest us. Poor little old lady, with\r\nher kindly face and pleasant ways, and her friendly cracked voice. Her\r\nfirm belief in all the uncanny and supernatural things that wiser people\r\nhave outgrown brought us face to face with the childhood of our race,\r\nand drew us into sympathy with a phase of culture in which all nature is\r\nwrapped in inscrutable mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 264._\r\n\r\nEach year that passes sees a few more stores adopting the habit of fixed\r\nprices, not to be altered by haggling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 282._\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the good offices of the fortune-teller were sought\r\nconcerning a marriage, and the powerful arranger of human destinies\r\ndiscovered that though everything else was favorable, the bride\r\ncontracted for was to come from a quarter quite opposed to the luck of\r\nthe bridegroom. This was no laughing matter, as the bride was of a noble\r\nfamily and the breaking of the engagement would be attended with much\r\ntalk and trouble on both sides; but, on the other hand, the family of\r\nthe bridegroom dared not face the danger so mysteriously prophesied by\r\nthe fortune-teller. In this predicament, there was nothing to do but to\r\npull the wool over the eyes of the gods as best they might. For this\r\npurpose the bride with all her belongings was sent the day before the\r\nwedding from her father's house to that of an uncle living in another\r\npart of the city, and on the morning of the wedding-day she came to her\r\nhusband from a quarter quite favorable to his fortunes. It seems quite\r\nprobable that the gods were taken in by this somewhat transparent\r\nsubterfuge, for no serious evil has befallen the young couple in three\r\nyears of married life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 317._\r\n\r\nTo the American mind this method of terminating relations is always\r\nirritating and frequently embarrassing, but in Japan any discomfort is\r\nto be endured rather than the slightest suspicion of bad manners. If the\r\nforeign visitor is trying to learn to be a good Japanese, she must\r\nsubmit patiently when the servant solemnly engaged fails to appear at\r\nthe appointed hour, sending a letter instead to say that she is ill; or\r\nwhen the woman upon whom she is depending to travel with her the next\r\nday to the country receives a telegram calling her to the bedside of a\r\nmythical son, and departs, bag and baggage, at a moment's notice,\r\nleaving her quondam mistress to shift for herself as best she may.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 318._\r\n\r\nAmong the many changes that have come over Japan in the transition from\r\nfeudalism to the conditions of modern life, there is none that Japanese\r\nladies regard with greater regret than the change in the servant\r\nquestion. As the years go by and new employments open to women, it\r\nbecomes increasingly difficult to engage and keep servants of the\r\nold-time, faithful, intelligent sort. Notwithstanding increased pay, and\r\nthe still existing conditions of considerate treatment, comfortable\r\nhomes, and light work, it is hard to fill places vacated, even in noble\r\nhouseholds: and there is almost as much shaking of heads and despondent\r\ntalk over the servant question in Japan to-day as there is in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 322._\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that it is to the quickness and courage of a\r\njinrikisha man who interposed between him and his would-be assassin that\r\nthe present Czar of Russia owes his escape from death at Otsu, near\r\nKy[=o]t[=o], in 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy task is ended. One half of Japan, with its virtues and its frailties,\r\nits privileges and its wrongs, has been brought, so far as my pen can\r\nbring it, within the knowledge of the American public. If, through this\r\nwork, one person setting forth for the Land of the Rising Sun goes\r\nbetter prepared to comprehend the thoughts, the needs, and the virtues\r\nof the noble, gentle, self-sacrificing women who make up one half the\r\npopulation of the Island Empire, my labor will not have been in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdoption, 103, 112, 187.\r\n\r\nAgility of
