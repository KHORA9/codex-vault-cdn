Possibly he may have settled in\r\nthe house in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft, in Aldgate Ward, in\r\nwhich he was residing in 1541; or there may be some truth in the\r\ntradition recorded by Walpole[1] that he lived for a time in a house on\r\nLondon Bridge, in close proximity to the Steelyard, where he was much\r\noccupied in painting various members of that colony of German merchants\r\nfor the next year or two. There is nothing to indicate that he returned\r\nto Chelsea, for the purpose of finishing the More family picture, or\r\nthat he received further commissions from Sir Thomas and his immediate\r\ncircle of friends. During Holbein’s absence in Basel More had been made\r\nLord Chancellor, but had resigned that office on May 16th, 1532, which\r\nwas about the time of Holbein’s return to London. More, a generous man,\r\nhad not amassed wealth in the public service, and on relinquishing\r\noffice and the salary it carried with it, retired into private life on a\r\nmodest income, not sufficient to permit a lavish patronage of art. Two\r\nother members of the More circle, and good friends to Holbein, Sir Henry\r\nGuldeford, and Archbishop Warham, died in the same year, the former in\r\nMay and the latter in August, and thus the painter lost two other\r\npatrons immediately after his return. A certain John Wolf was the\r\npainter employed to provide the escutcheons, banners, and other\r\ndecorations for Guldeford’s funeral.[2]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  _Anecdotes_, &c., ed. Wornum, 1888, vol. i. 86, note.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, v. 1064.\r\n\r\nWhether Holbein’s appearance amid entirely new surroundings was due to\r\nthese events is doubtful. It is natural to suppose that he would turn\r\ninstinctively towards a society of fellow-countrymen, speaking the same\r\nlanguage, and of similar habits and modes of thought, with whom he would\r\nfeel most at home, men of comfortable fortunes, well able to afford the\r\nluxury of sitting for their portraits, and with the means also of\r\nfinding him other remunerative work.\r\n\r\nThese merchants of the Hanseatic League in London formed a rich\r\ncorporation of considerable numerical strength, whose beginnings went\r\nback to the very early days of English history. Some of its most\r\nvaluable privileges and trading monopolies were granted it by Richard I\r\nand Edward III, in return for moneys lent, monopolies which hampered\r\nEnglish trade for centuries afterwards. This colony had always occupied\r\na part of the river bank above London Bridge, on the site of what is now\r\nthe South-Eastern Railway Station in Cannon Street.[3] Their buildings\r\nwere surrounded by a turreted wall, which stretched from the river\r\nnorthward to Thames Street, and from Allhallows Street on the east to\r\nCosin (Cousins) Lane on the west, their property extending towards\r\nDowgate. Entrance in the principal front in Thames Street was by three\r\nfortified gateways, above which the Imperial double-eagle floated, and\r\nwithin stood their old stone Guildhall, with a pleasant garden planted\r\non one side with fruit trees and vines after the fashion of their\r\nfatherland, and, to the west of the main gate, vaults where Rhenish wine\r\nand other foreign delicacies were sold, a favourite place of resort for\r\nEnglish citizens as well as foreigners. It has been generally supposed\r\nthat its name, the Steelyard, or _Stahlhof_, arose from the great\r\nweighing-machine or steelyard which stood within its entrance.[4] The\r\nGuildhall and Council Chamber were situated in the western corner on\r\nThames Street, and several passages, including Windgoose Alley, ran from\r\nthat street to the river, giving access to the shops and small houses,\r\nthe latter usually consisting of a bedroom and sitting-room for the\r\nmerchant, and, at the back, stores and apartments for clerks and\r\nworkmen. The corporation was a close one, and the rules by which its\r\nmembers were bound were as strict as those of a monastery. Within its\r\nprecincts women were strictly forbidden; all married members had to live\r\noutside the walls, nor were guests allowed to lodge there unless also of\r\nthe Hanseatic community. Each night at nine the gates were shut, and the\r\nSteelyard was then like a small walled German town in the midst of\r\nLondon. The breaking of its laws, or the practice of any bad habits, was\r\nfollowed by severe punishment. Its members, too, were obliged to take\r\ntheir share in the wider civic life of London. The Steelyard was\r\nrepresented by an Alderman and a Deputy, and, among other duties, each\r\nmerchant had his allotted post in case of war, and was obliged to keep\r\nthe necessary arms ready for the defence of the city.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The buildings of the Steelyard were finally pulled down in the autumn\r\n  of 1863, and the ground was excavated immediately afterwards. The\r\n  Cannon Street Railway Station covers approximately the whole site of\r\n  the Steelyard except the strip on the north front cut off for the\r\n  widening of Upper Thames Street. See Philip Norman, “Notes on the\r\n  Later History of the Steelyard in London,” _Archæologia_, vol. lxi.\r\n  pt. ii. (1909), pp. 389-426; Wykeham Archer, _Once a Week_, vol. v.\r\n  (1861); J. E. Price, _Transactions of the London and Middlesex\r\n  Archæological Society_, vol. iii. 67 (1870). See also for the whole\r\n  history of the Steelyard, Lappenberg, _Urkundliche Geschichte des\r\n  Hansischen Stahlhofes zu London_, Hamburg, 1851.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Norman, however, considers that it has nothing to do with a\r\n  weighing-machine, but that it is an Anglicised form of the German\r\n  “Stahlhof.” See his paper in _Archæologia_, quoted on the preceding\r\n  page.\r\n\r\nTheir privileges were so great that they had always been unpopular, and\r\nthis dislike grew in strength until the reign of Henry VIII, when the\r\nfirst attempts were made to break up their monopolies, which ended, some\r\nsixty years later, in their complete overthrow. When Holbein first came\r\namong them, however, they still occupied the foremost place in the\r\ncommercial life of London, and were an exceedingly rich and prosperous\r\ncommunity. They served the King and Court in more ways than one, for\r\nthey were constantly made use of for the despatch of letters abroad and\r\nfor the translation of communications received from foreign countries.\r\nThey made arrangements with their agents in Europe for the payment of\r\nthe diets and other expenses of Henry’s ambassadors and special\r\nmessengers, and much confidential continental news was received through\r\ntheir business houses. Books, prints, and various rare and artistic\r\nobjects were also forwarded to them for delivery to the English court.\r\nThomas Cromwell, in particular, made much use of them in the sending and\r\nreceiving of foreign correspondence. They also entertained all important\r\nvisitors, artists, craftsmen, and others of their own countrymen who\r\nvisited England.\r\n\r\nHolbein, however, does not appear to have come into contact with them\r\nduring his first visit to England; no portrait, at least, of a Steelyard\r\nmerchant of that date has survived, though he painted Niklaus Kratzer,\r\nwho must have known many of them intimately. Possibly his introduction\r\nto them in 1532 was due to his friendship with the German astronomer. In\r\nany case, between 1532 and 1536, he painted a considerable number of\r\nthem, chiefly small half-length portraits, in which the sitter is shown\r\nin his own room or office, dressed in sober black, with the accessories\r\nof his work scattered round him, and with letters in front of him\r\ncontaining his name and his address at the Steelyard. These portraits\r\nwere most probably painted for presentation by the sitters to the League\r\nof which they were leading members, to be hung on the walls of the\r\nCouncil Chamber of their Guildhall, rather than for the purpose of\r\nsending them to family relations abroad. This would account for the\r\npresence of several of them in England to-day, for when the Guild was\r\nfinally broken up in 1598 and much of its property scattered far and\r\nwide, some of the portraits remained in this country while others found\r\ntheir way abroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 1\r\n  GEORG GISZE\r\n  KAISER FRIEDRICH MUSEUM, BERLIN\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF GEORG GISZE]\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Georg Gisze, now in the Berlin Museum (No. 586) (Pl.\r\n1),[5] was one of the first, if not the first, of these likenesses of\r\nSteelyard merchants to be painted by Holbein. This portrait is not only\r\nthe most elaborate work of the whole series, but the sitter was also one\r\nof the most important members of the League then in London. His name is\r\nspelt in more than one way on the picture itself, and other versions of\r\nit are to be found in the English State Papers. In the letter from his\r\nbrother, which he holds in his hand, he is addressed, according to the\r\nBerlin Catalogue, as Jerg Gisze. The full address is “Dem erszamen\r\nJergen Gisze to lunden in engelant mynen broder to handen.” Below the\r\nmotto on the wall, beneath the shelf on the left—“Nulla sine merore\r\nvoluptas”—in the sitter’s own handwriting, is the signature G. Gisze or\r\nGyze. It has been read both ways, for the second letter may be taken\r\neither as an _i_ followed by a long _s_, or, as two connected strokes\r\nrepresenting the letter _y_. On other letters from foreign\r\ncorrespondents, tucked behind the wall-rails on the right, his name is\r\nalso spelt Gisse and Ghisse, while in the distich inscribed on a\r\ncartellino fastened to the wall over his head it appears in its\r\nLatinised form of Gysen. This distich, which also contains the date and\r\nthe sitter’s age, runs as follows:—\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 115. Reproduced by Davies, p. 140; Knackfuss, fig. 117;\r\n  Berlin Catg., p. 176; Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 95; and in colour by the\r\n  Medici Society.\r\n\r\n              “Δισυχι`ον ĭ Jmaginē Georgii Gysenii\r\n                Jsta refert vultus, qua cernis Jmago Georgi\r\n                  Sic oculos viuos, sic habet ille Genas.\r\n                    Anno ætatis suæ xxxiiij\r\n                      Anno dom 1532.”\r\n\r\nIn days when spelling was largely phonetic it is not surprising to find\r\nproper names spelt in a variety of ways, and the Hanse merchants, in\r\nparticular, received letters from correspondents in all parts of the\r\nworld, speaking a variety of languages and dialects. According to the\r\nBerlin Catalogue, Georg Gisze was born on 2nd April 1497, so that he was\r\nof Holbein’s own age, and died in February 1562, and was a member of a\r\nleading Danzig family. Woltmann regarded him as a Swiss, and states that\r\nthere was a family called Gysin settled in the neighbourhood of Basel,\r\nand that the name is still to be seen on numerous sign-boards in the\r\nadjacent small town of Liestall.[6] Miss Hervey, on the other hand,\r\nsuggests that, however the name may be spelt, it was probably a\r\nvariation of that of Gueiss, which was one of the most distinguished in\r\nthe annals of the Steelyard.[7] The family belonged to Cologne, and\r\nAlbert von Gueiss was a representative of the Steelyard at the\r\nConference held at Bruges in 1520. In at least one entry in the\r\nSteelyard records this name is spelt Gisse. She suggests, therefore,\r\nthat Georg Gisze may have been a younger brother or a son of this Albert\r\nvon Gueiss. In his book on Holbein’s “Ambassadors” picture, Mr. W. F.\r\nDickes, who, in his anxiety to prove that Holbein was not in England in\r\n1532, conveniently ignores the evidence of the letter which Gisze holds\r\nin his hand, addressed to him “in London,” conclusive proof that the\r\nportrait was produced in this country, is of opinion that it was painted\r\nin Basel.[8] Little is known of its history since it left the walls of\r\nthe Guildhall in Thames Street. It was in the Orleans Collection in\r\n1727, and was purchased at the sale of that collection by Christian von\r\nMechel.[9] Various attempts to induce the Basel Library to buy it proved\r\nunavailing. It was afterwards for a time in Basel, and in 1821 was added\r\nto the Solly Collection, passing later into the Berlin Gallery.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. 366.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  _Holbein’s Ambassadors_, p. 240.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  _Holbein’s “Ambassadors” Unriddled_, p. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  See Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 240.

See Waagen, _Treasures_,\r\n  &c., Vol. ii. p. 500.\r\n\r\nThe first time the name of Georg Gisze occurs in the English State\r\nPapers is in 1522,[10] when he was twenty-four years of age. The paper\r\nis an English translation of a protection, dated Lyon, 26 June 1522,\r\ngranted by Francis I to Gerrard van Werden, George Hasse, Henry Melman,\r\nGeo. Gyse, Geo. Strowse, Elard Smetyng, Hans Colynbrowgh, and Perpoynt\r\nDeovanter, merchants of the Hanse, during the war between him, the\r\nEmperor, and England. They are forbidden to deal in wheat, salt,\r\n“ollrons,” harness, and weapons of war. Deovanter appears to have been\r\none of the leading merchants. At this period he went as a representative\r\nof the Steelyard on several missions to Francis for the purpose of the\r\nrecovery of goods taken from their ships by the Captain of Boulogne.\r\nDuring his absence he gave power of attorney in a suit of his against\r\nGeorge Byrom, of Salford, to several friends and fellow-merchants, among\r\nthem “George Guyse,” and, it is interesting to note, “Th. Crumwell, of\r\nLondon, gent.”[11]\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iii. pt. ii. 2350.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iii. pt. ii. 2446, 2447, 2754.\r\n\r\nThe next reference to Gisze is at Michaelmas, 1533, in a letter from\r\nThomas Houth to the Earl of Kildare in Ireland,[12] respecting the death\r\nof a certain John Wolff, in which, speaking of some bills, he says,—“I\r\nascertained at the Steelyard that the handwriting was his, by the\r\nevidence of Geo. Gyes, the alderman’s deputy, and others.” This letter\r\nproves that Gisze held an important position in the Steelyard, as Deputy\r\nto the Alderman, who was probably Barthold Beckman, of Hamburg.[13]\r\nPossibly his appointment to this position occasioned the painting of his\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. vi. 1170.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  Lappenberg, _Urkundliche Geschichte des Hansischen Stahlhofes zu\r\n  London_, p. 157; Miss Hervey, _Holbein’s Ambassadors_, p. 239.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF GEORG GISZE]\r\n\r\nThe portrait is life-size, and half-length, the sitter being turned to\r\nthe right, the face towards the spectator, and the eyes turned slightly\r\nto the left. He is wearing a flat black cap over his fair hair, which is\r\ncut straight across the forehead and covers the ears; and a dress of\r\nrose-coloured silk with a sleeveless overcoat of black, and a fine white\r\nlinen shirt. He is seated behind a table covered with a cloth of Eastern\r\ndesign, and is in the act of opening his brother’s letter. By him, on\r\nthe table, stands a tall vase of Venetian glass with twisted handles,\r\nfilled with carnations, and scattered in front of him are various\r\nobjects used in his business, a seal, inkstand, scissors, quill pens, a\r\nleather case with metal bands and clasps, and a box containing money.\r\nFrom the shelves on the walls hang scales for weighing gold, a seal\r\nattached to a long chain, and a metal ball for string, with a damascened\r\ndesign and a band with the words “HEER EN” repeated round it.[14] Books\r\nand a box are upon the shelves, and tucked within the narrow wooden bars\r\nwhich run round the walls are parchment tags for seals and several\r\nletters with addresses in High German. On these occur the dates 1528 and\r\n1531, while the names of the correspondents with which they are endorsed\r\ncan be more or less clearly discerned, as well as the word “England.”\r\nWoltmann reads the names as “Tomas Bandz,” “Jergen ze Basel,” and “Hans\r\nStolten.” This last letter is marked with the writer’s particular\r\ndevice, which also occurs on a second letter, and is very similar to the\r\ndevice on the letter in the picture of Derich Tybis in Vienna. The walls\r\nof his room are painted in greyish green, the paint shown as rubbed and\r\ndiscoloured here and there, and along the bars and shelves, which have\r\nbeen worn by constant use.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  In the inventory of the goods of John Wolff, attached to the letter\r\n  mentioned above, a similar ball is included—“a round ball gilt for\r\n  sealing thread to hang out of to seal withal.” _C.L.P._, vol. vi.\r\n  1170.\r\n\r\nThe painting of the numerous details is wonderful in its accurate\r\nrealism, showing the closest observation and an evident delight in their\r\nperfect rendering. It has been suggested, as the picture contains many\r\nmore accessories than in his other portraits of members of the\r\nSteelyard, that Holbein took particular pains with it as the first of a\r\npossible series, and that it was a kind of “show-piece,” in order that\r\nhis clients might see of what he was capable. This superb portrait,\r\nwhich is in a better state of preservation than most of Holbein’s\r\nexisting works, is finer in its clear, luminous colour and more delicate\r\nin its drawing than any other of his pictures of this period. It is\r\nalmost Flemish in the minuteness and care of its finish and in its cool,\r\nclear tones. All the objects of still-life which surround the sitter,\r\nwhich are placed about him as naturally as though the artist had come\r\nupon him suddenly when engaged upon his daily business, and had there\r\nand then painted him, without arranging or posing, whether of silk, or\r\nlinen, or gold, or steel, or glass, are painted with a fidelity to\r\nnature never excelled by the Dutchmen or Flemings of the following\r\ncentury, who devoted their whole career to the rendering of still-life.\r\nIn Holbein’s portrait, however, all these carefully-wrought minor\r\ndetails, beautiful in themselves as they may be, in no way force\r\nthemselves on the attention to the detriment of the portrait itself,\r\nwhich stands out as a vivid representation of the sitter’s personality,\r\nin which the essentials of his character have been seen with an unerring\r\neye, and set down upon the panel with an unerring hand. We get here the\r\nyoung German merchant to the very life, precise, deliberate and orderly\r\nin the transaction of his affairs, with strongly-marked German features,\r\nlong nose, and determined chin, a living presentment which only a master\r\ncould have produced.\r\n\r\nRuskin’s glowing description of the picture is well known, but it is so\r\ntrue and so eloquent that a sentence from it may be quoted:—\r\n\r\n    “Every accessory is perfect with a fine perfection; the\r\n    carnations in the glass by his side; the ball of gold, chased\r\n    with blue enamel, suspended on the wall; the books, the\r\n    steelyard, the papers on the table, the seal ring with its\r\n    quartered bearings—all intensely there, and there in beauty of\r\n    which no one could have dreamed that even flowers or gold were\r\n    capable, far less parchment or steel. But every change of\r\n    shade is felt, every rich and rubied line of petal followed,\r\n    every subdued gleam in the soft blue of the enamel and bending\r\n    of the gold touched with a hand whose patience of regard\r\n    creates rather than paints. The jewel itself was not so\r\n    precious as the rays of enduring light which form it, beneath\r\n    that errorless hand. The man himself what he was—not more; but\r\n    to all conceivable proof of sight, in all aspect of life or\r\n    thought—not less. He sits alone in his accustomed room, his\r\n    common work laid out before him; he is conscious of no\r\n    presence, assumes no dignity, bears no sudden or superficial\r\n    look of care or interest, lives only as he lived—but for ever.\r\n    It is inexhaustible. Every detail of it wins, retains, rewards\r\n    the attention with a continually increasing sense of\r\n    wonderfulness. It is also wholly true. So far as it reaches,\r\n    it contains the absolute facts of colour, form, and character,\r\n    rendered with an unaccusable faithfulness.”[15]\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Ruskin, “Sir Joshua and Holbein,” _Cornhill Magazine_, March 1860;\r\n  reprinted in _On the Old Road_, vol. i. pt. i. pp. 221-236.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 2\r\n  HANS OF ANTWERP\r\n  1532\r\n  WINDSOR CASTLE\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF HANS OF ANTWERP]\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Hans of Antwerp, in Windsor Castle (Pl. 2),[16] belongs\r\nto the summer of the same year, 1532, and was one of the earliest of the\r\nSteelyard series. It is in oil on panel, and has darkened with age, and\r\nhas suffered to some extent from repaintings. It represents the\r\nhalf-length figure of a middle-aged man, about three-quarters the size\r\nof life. He is turned to the right, seated at a table, upon which his\r\nelbows rest, and he is about to cut the string of a letter with a long\r\nknife. He has thick bushy hair and beard, brown in colour, and brown\r\neyes, and is wearing a dark overcoat, which may have been originally\r\ndark green in colour, edged with a broad band of brown fur, and beneath\r\nit a brown dress and a white shirt with the collar embroidered with\r\nblack Spanish work. On his head is a flat black cap. The table is\r\ncovered with a dark green cloth, and upon it, in front of him, are\r\nplaced a pad of paper with a quill pen resting on it, some coins and a\r\nseal engraved with the letter W. The head, strongly lightened, stands\r\nout against a background of grey-brown wall, with a strip of darker\r\ncolour on the right-hand side of the panel. He wears a signet ring on\r\nthe first finger of his left hand, and a smaller ring on the little\r\nfinger of the right.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 265. Reproduced by Law, _Holbein’s Pictures at Windsor\r\n  Castle_, Pl. ii.; Davies, p. 30; Knackfuss, fig. 119; Cust, _Royal\r\n  Collection of Paintings, Windsor Castle_, 1906, Pl. 46; Ganz,\r\n  _Holbein_, p. 96.\r\n\r\nThe letter which he holds in his hand has a superscription in crabbed\r\nTeutonic writing, which Woltmann, after careful examination, deciphered\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n                     “_Dem ersamen H[a]nnsen\r\n                      Von Anwerpen ... lo [....] vpn\r\n                      Stallhoff zv h[anden]._”\r\n\r\nThe parts in brackets are hidden in the original by the knife, and have\r\nbeen added conjecturally by him, so that the whole inscription would run\r\nin English: “To the honourable Hans of Antwerp in London, in the\r\nSteelyard, these to hand.” The words “ersamen” and “Stallhoff” are\r\ndistinct, but the “Anwerpen” is less clear, and only the first letter of\r\nthe Christian name is certain.\r\n\r\nThe brown under-dress the sitter is wearing certainly has some\r\nappearance of the leather apron worn by goldsmiths which Woltmann\r\ndeclared it to be;[17] and this, together with the gold coins on the\r\ntable, such as goldsmiths were in the habit of exhibiting in their\r\nshops, he regarded as additional proof that the portrait represents the\r\ngoldsmith, Hans of Antwerp, Holbein’s close friend and one of his\r\nexecutors.[18] There is considerable probability that this ascription is\r\ncorrect, though it is by no means absolutely certain. On the paper-pad\r\nlying on the table there is an inscription, evidently in the sitter’s\r\nhandwriting, giving his age and the date. Even this inscription is not\r\nabsolutely clear. Woltmann reads it:—\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. p. 368. An under-dress of similar fashion, however, is\r\n  worn by nearly all Holbein’s Steelyard sitters.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  It should be noted, however, that similar coins appear in the box on\r\n  the table in the portrait of Georg Gisze.\r\n\r\n                     “Anno dm. 1532 an. d. 26 Julii\r\n                        Ætatis suæ ...”\r\n\r\nThe second “A.D.,” however, is evidently wrong. Mr. Law[19] reads it as\r\na possible “Aug.” for August, and is doubtful about the word “Julii.”\r\nBoth these writers fail to decipher the sitter’s age, but it appears to\r\nbe “53,” or, perhaps, “33,” the latter agreeing better with the apparent\r\nage of the sitter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Law, _Holbein’s Pictures_, &c., p. 5.\r\n\r\nThe W. on the seal affords some evidence against the portrait being that\r\nof John of Antwerp. Woltmann calls it “the device of his trading house,”\r\nand in this Mr. Law follows him. It is much more probable, however, that\r\nit is the initial of his surname. The seal is of a similar shape to\r\nthose in the portraits of Georg Gisze and Derich Tybis. In the former\r\nthe lettering is illegible, but in the latter it is plainly “D. T.”\r\nBefore Hans of Antwerp’s surname was known, Woltmann’s suggestion was\r\nnot out of place, but Mr. Lionel Cust[20] has recently discovered it to\r\nhave been Van der Gow, which does not accord with the letter on the\r\nseal. Among the numerous references to John of Antwerp in the State\r\nPapers and elsewhere he is never once spoken of as belonging to the\r\nSteelyard, whereas the picture in question is in all probability a\r\nportrait of some merchant of the Hanseatic League. More than one German\r\nmerchant of the Steelyard whose surname began with W is mentioned in the\r\nrecords, such as Gerard van Werden and Ulric Wise, while one of the\r\nleading jewellers of Henry’s reign was Morgan Wolf, though he was almost\r\ncertainly a Welshman. However, until further evidence is forthcoming,\r\nthe name Hans of Antwerp must stand as the sitter for this portrait, and\r\nit has much in its favour.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. viii. No. XXXV. (Feb. 1906), pp. 356-60.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF HANS OF ANTWERP]\r\n\r\nAs the friend and witness and administrator of Holbein’s will, the\r\nquestion of the true portrait of John of Antwerp is of unusual interest.\r\nThe two men appear to have been closely associated, and there is no\r\ndoubt that Holbein supplied him with designs. One such design is well\r\nknown—the drawing for a beautiful drinking-cup in the Basel Gallery upon\r\nwhich is inscribed the name “Hans Von Ant....” (Pl. 42).[21] Mr. Lionel\r\nCust conjectures that the cup given by Cromwell to the King on New\r\nYear’s Day, 1539, made by John of Antwerp, was this identical cup; but\r\nit hardly appears probable that an object made for such a purpose would\r\nhave the maker’s name placed upon it so prominently on a broad band\r\nrunning round its centre. It may be suggested that it is more likely to\r\nhave been intended by the maker for presentation to the Hanseatic League\r\nto form part of the corporation plate of that body kept in the Guildhall\r\nof the Steelyard.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 110 (104). See p. 275.\r\n\r\nJohn of Antwerp’s name occurs frequently in the private accounts of\r\nThomas Cromwell for the years 1537-39, and Mr. Lionel Cust has gathered\r\ntogether much interesting information about him. In a letter from\r\nCromwell to the Goldsmiths’ Company we learn that he had been settled in\r\nLondon since 1515, but the first reference to him Mr. Cust finds is in\r\nMarch 1537, in the Privy Purse Expenses of the Princess Mary, which\r\nruns: “Item payed for goldsmythes workes for my ladies grace to John of\r\nAndwarpe iiij _li_, xvij _s_, vij _d_.” There is, however, an earlier\r\nreference, and one of considerable interest, in the State Papers, in a\r\nletter from one Richard Cavendish to the Duke of Suffolk, dated Norton,\r\n5th June 1534, which shows that John Van Andwerp was at that time\r\nemployed with a certain Hans De Fromont in searching for a gold mine at\r\nNorton. “They are,” says Cavendish, “applying themselves with diligence\r\nto find the mine. Here is the greatest diversity of earth and stones,\r\nfor the stones in the gravel in most places appear to be very gold. Many\r\nassays have been made to prove it, but nothing found as yet, and it is\r\nbelieved the glitter ‘is but the scum of the metal which groweth beneath\r\nthe ground.’ They have now begun to dig pits to get at the principal\r\nvein. The people are as glad as ever he saw to further the matter, for\r\nin old evidences the place is called Golden Norton, which proves that\r\ngold may be found there. He sees no great forwardness as yet, but prays\r\nGod they may find some.”[22]\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. vii. 800.\r\n\r\nCromwell employed him in a number of ways. In December 1537[23] he\r\nreceived 15_s._ for setting a great ruby, and 29_s._ for the gold in the\r\nring. In November 1538[24] he was at work on the cup already mentioned\r\nfor a New Year’s Gift to Henry, for which purpose he received 52 oz. of\r\ngold, and was paid nearly £20. Other work during these years consisted\r\nin making a George, setting stones in rings, making chains and\r\ntrenchers, and repairing various Georges, Garters, and other jewellery\r\nbelonging to the Lord Privy Seal, full details of which will be found in\r\nMr. Cust’s paper, the last entry being dated 15th December 1539.[25]\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 782, ii. (p. 333).\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 782, ii. (p. 338).\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, under various dates.\r\n\r\nAn entry in the Book of Payments of the Treasurer of the Chamber for\r\nApril 1539[26] shows him in another capacity, one, as already noted, in\r\nwhich the foreign traders in England were frequently employed by the\r\nCourt. He received one shilling from the King’s purse for forwarding\r\nletters of importance to Christopher Mount and Thomas Panell, “his\r\ngracis servauntes and oratours in Jarmayne.”[27]\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 781 (p. 309).\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Cust suggests that this message was addressed to Holbein. He says:\r\n  “At Lady Day, 1539, he (Holbein) seems to have been still absent (in\r\n  Basel), though he was back in England before Midsummer.” (_Burlington\r\n  Magazine_, February 1906, p. 359.) This, however, is not probable.\r\n  Holbein was certainly back from Basel by December 1538, when he\r\n  received £10 for his journey to Upper Burgundy, and he presented a\r\n  portrait of Prince Edward to the King on New Year’s Day, 1539. He\r\n  received no salary on Lady Day, 1539, because he had already received\r\n  a year’s wages in advance at Midsummer, 1538, to date from the\r\n  previous Lady Day, and not because he was out of England. At this\r\n  period messages and money were being constantly sent to Christopher\r\n  Mount, who was much abroad on missions to the German Protestant\r\n  princes, and the question of the marriage with Cleves was only one of\r\n  the many affairs, and one of the least important, upon which he was\r\n  then engaged.\r\n\r\nIn 1537 Hans of Antwerp’s name occurs in the return for Subsidies of\r\nAliens in England, among foreigners dwelling in the parish of St.\r\nNicholas Acon, as “John Andwarpe, straunger, xxx _li._, xxx _s._” In a\r\nsimilar list for the same parish in 1541 he is given for the first time\r\nhis proper name: “John Vander Gow, _alias_ John Andwerp, in goodes, xxx\r\n_li._, xxx _s._” Mr. Cust suggests that his name may have been Van der\r\nGoes. This assessment of his goods at £30 and the tax on it of thirty\r\nshillings was the customary rate for foreigners. Nicholas Lyzarde,\r\nElizabeth’s serjeant-painter,[28] was assessed to the same amount—but\r\nHolbein was taxed at the higher rate of £3 on his salary of £30, as it\r\nwas the custom to tax “lands, fees and annuities” at double the rate of\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  See p. 309.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF HANS OF ANTWERP]\r\n\r\nIn April of the same year Van der Gow was anxious to obtain the freedom\r\nof the Goldsmiths’ Company as a step towards being admitted to the right\r\nof citizenship in London. Cromwell’s letter, recommending him to the\r\nCompany “most hartely,” states that he had already lived twenty-six\r\nyears in London, had married an Englishwoman, by whom he had many\r\nchildren, and purposed continuing in London for the rest of his life.\r\nThis desire to become a naturalised Englishman might be taken as some\r\nevidence that he was not a member of the Steelyard confraternity.\r\n\r\nFrom the register of the church of St. Nicholas Acon, in Lombard Street,\r\nwhere the goldsmiths have always congregated, we learn that he had a\r\nson, Augustine Anwarpe, baptized on 27th November 1542, and a second\r\nson, Roger, on 10th December 1547; that on three successive days in\r\nSeptember 1543 three of his servants, John Ducheman, Jane, his maid, and\r\nRichard, were buried; that a fourth servant was buried on the 10th\r\nAugust 1548; and that his son Augustine was buried on 1st July 1550.[29]\r\nThere can be little doubt that the three servants died of the plague\r\nwhich was raging in London in September 1543. Holbein was almost\r\ncertainly another of its victims, and Mr. Cust suggests that he may very\r\nprobably have caught the infection in John Van der Gow’s house.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  These facts are taken from Mr. Cust’s paper.\r\n\r\nThe portrait, it is to be supposed, like Holbein’s other representations\r\nof Steelyard merchants, was very possibly presented to the Guild, and\r\nwould remain hanging in their Guildhall until they were expelled by\r\nElizabeth in 1598. “When in 1606,” says Woltmann, quoting from\r\nLappenberg, “under James I, the Steelyard was given back to its\r\npossessors, the rooms were found in an evil condition, and all movables,\r\nsuch as tables, seats, bedsteads, and even panels and glass windows,\r\nwere almost entirely stolen. That under such circumstances a sparing\r\nhand watched over the pictures is scarcely to be expected.”[30] The\r\nportrait of Hans of Antwerp, whatever its earlier adventures may have\r\nbeen, was in the collection of Charles I, in which it was No. 29, and is\r\ndescribed in his catalogue as: “Done by Holbein. _Item._ Upon a cracked\r\nboard, the picture of a merchant, in a black cap and habit having a\r\nletter with a knife in his hand cutting the seal thread of the letter; a\r\nseal lying by on a green table; bought by Sir Harry Vane and given to\r\nthe King.” The crack in the panel is still plainly visible. It was\r\nvalued by the Commonwealth Commissioners at £100, and sold for that sum.\r\nIt reappears, however, in James II’s catalogue, No. 499: “By Holbein. A\r\nman’s head, in a black cap, with a letter and penknife in his hand.” It\r\nis possible that it is the picture by “Holbin” of “a Dutchman sealing a\r\nletter,” which was in the Duke of Buckingham’s collection at York House\r\nin 1635,[31] from which it may have passed into that of Charles I. The\r\npicture, though it has not the richness and transparency of colour of\r\nthe “Gisze,” or its extreme delicacy of execution and luxuriance of\r\ndetail, is a vigorous and life-like representation of a somewhat stolid\r\nGerman, painted with the truth and sincerity which Holbein brought to\r\neverything he touched.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. p. 381. See also Norman, _Archæologia_, vol. lxi. pt. ii.\r\n  p. 394.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  See Randall Davies, “Inventory of the Duke of Buckingham’s Pictures,”\r\n  &c., _Burlington Magazine_, March 1907, p. 382.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAITS OF TWO OF THE WEDIGHS]\r\n\r\nThe two small roundels, which hitherto have always been regarded as\r\nlikenesses of Holbein himself, undoubtedly represent, as Dr. Ganz has\r\nrecently pointed out, the same individual as the sitter in the Windsor\r\npicture, who, until his identity is finally settled, it is most\r\nconvenient to call Hans of Antwerp. The first is the beautiful little\r\npainting on oak in the Salting collection,[32] in which the sitter is\r\nshown in full-face, with a flat black cap, a gown lined with\r\nlight-coloured fur, and a dark under-coat or vest, cut straight across\r\nthe top, as in most of Holbein’s other Steelyard portraits. The left\r\nhand only is shown, with a ring on the first finger. On the background\r\non either side of the head is the faded inscription “ETATIS SVÆ 35.” It\r\nwas possibly painted a year or two later than the Windsor portrait, to\r\nwhich the likeness is very marked. If, however, the sitter really\r\nrepresents Hans of Antwerp, and he was painted a second time by Holbein\r\nabout 1534-5, when 35 years of age, he must have been only a boy when he\r\nsettled in London in 1515. The second roundel is in Lord Spencer’s\r\ncollection at Althorp,[33] and this, too, has always been regarded as a\r\nportrait of Holbein by himself. Here again the likeness to the Windsor\r\npicture is a strong one, though the opposite side of the face is seen,\r\nas he is shown in three-quarters profile to the spectator’s left. There\r\nare slight variations in the dress, the undervest being lower, and\r\ndisclosing more of the white shirt. Some critics regard it as a genuine\r\nwork by Holbein, but Dr. Ganz places it among the doubtful and\r\nwrongly-attributed pictures. He suggests that it is probably one of the\r\ntwo roundels considered to be self-portraits by Holbein which C. van\r\nMander saw in Amsterdam in 1604, and was engraved by A. Stock as such in\r\n1612 and published by H. Hondius. There is a replica of it in the\r\nProvinzial Museum in Hanover.[34] All three works evidently represent\r\nthe same man, and at about the same age.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Exhibited Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1909, Case D, No. 1, and\r\n  reproduced in the Catalogue, Pl. xxxiv.; also by Ganz, _Holbein_, p.\r\n  114.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 226.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  See Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 253.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1532, he painted another goldsmith, Hans von Zürich,\r\nbut the picture has disappeared, and is now only known from the\r\nengraving Hollar made of it in 1647, when it was in the Arundel\r\ncollection. In the engraving he is shown at half-length, full-face, the\r\nbody turned slightly to the left, and is a thin man, with a pleasant\r\nexpression. It is inscribed on the top: “Hans von Zürch, Goltshmidt.\r\nHans Holbein, 1532,” and below, “W. Hollar fecit, 1647, ex collectione\r\nArundeliana,” and has a dedication by the publisher, H. Vander Borcht,\r\nto Matthäus Merian.[35] The date indicates that Hans von Zürich must\r\nhave been living in London at that time, though his name does not occur\r\nin the State Papers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 197 (i.). Parthey, No. 1411.\r\n\r\nOne other portrait of a German merchant by Holbein was painted in the\r\nyear 1532.[36] It is in the collection of Count von Schönborn in Vienna,\r\nand is one of a pair of portraits of brothers or near relations, members\r\nof the Wedigh family of Cologne.[37] They hung together until 1865, in\r\nwhich year the finer one of the two, dated 1533, was acquired by Herr B.\r\nSuermondt, of Aix-la-Chapelle, and is now in the Berlin Gallery, having\r\nbeen purchased in 1874, together with another fine portrait by Holbein\r\nof an unknown young man, from the Suermondt collection. The close\r\nrelationship of the two sitters is proved by the exactly similar coat of\r\narms on the enamelled ring each one is wearing. In the first edition of\r\nhis book Woltmann gave it as his opinion that they were Englishmen, but\r\nafterwards came to the conclusion that both portraits represented German\r\nSteelyard merchants. The belief that they were Englishmen was afterwards\r\nstrengthened by a communication to the Berlin authorities from Privy\r\nCouncillor Dielitz, who, from the coat of arms on the rings, held that\r\nthe pictures represented two members of the English family of Trelawney.\r\nThis ascription, however, has been proved to be wrong, and it may be\r\npointed out that the motto inscribed on the paper projecting from the\r\nbook in the Vienna portrait,—“Veritas odium parit” (“Truth brings\r\nhatred”), is not the present motto of the Trelawney family. On the side\r\nof the same book, painted on the edges of the leaves, are the letters “H\r\nE R. W I D.,” and more recent research has established the fact that the\r\ntwo men were members of the Wedigh family. Members of this patrician\r\nfamily of Cologne had been connected with the London Steelyard since\r\n1480. In this connection it is interesting to note that the seal in the\r\nso-called “Hans of Antwerp” picture is engraved with the letter “W,”\r\nwhich suggests some possibility that he, too, may have been a Wedigh.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 262. Reproduced by Knackfuss, fig. 118; Ganz, _Holbein_, p.\r\n  97.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  Both portraits are mentioned in an inventory of 1746.\r\n\r\nThe 1532 picture in the Schönborn collection is a small half-length. The\r\nsubject, who is seated at the back of a table, is turned to the right,\r\nwith head almost full-front and looking at the spectator. His right arm\r\nrests on the table, and he holds his gloves in his left hand. His hair,\r\ncut straight across his forehead, covers his ears, and he is\r\nclean-shaven. He is wearing the usual dark overcoat with deep fur\r\ncollar, and an inner collar or lining of lighter fur, opened\r\nsufficiently to show a part of his embroidered under-dress, the sleeves\r\nof which are of watered or patterned silk, and a white pleated shirt\r\ngathered round the neck in a small frill. The customary flat black cap\r\nis on his head. On the table to the left is a leather-bound book with\r\ntwo clasps, with the artist’s initials on the cover, and a piece of\r\npaper projecting from between the leaves on which is written the Latin\r\nmotto already quoted. On the plain blue background is inscribed on\r\neither side of the head, “ANNO. 1532.” and “ÆTATIS.SVÆ. 29.” It is a\r\nsympathetic and simple rendering of a young man of serious expression,\r\nin which both the beardless face, of a somewhat reddish complexion, and\r\nthe two hands are very finely painted. Woltmann conjectured that the\r\nLatin motto indicated that the book on the table might be one of those\r\nwritings which the German reformers were at that time busily engaged in\r\nsmuggling into England, the secret dissemination of which neither Wolsey\r\nor More could stay, in spite of the drastic methods they employed to\r\nstamp it out. Although possessing many privileges, the men of the\r\nSteelyard were by no means free from persecutions of this nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF HERMANN WEDIGH]\r\n\r\nThe companion picture, in the Berlin Gallery (No. 586B) (Pl. 3),\r\nrepresents Hermann Hillebrandt Wedigh.[38] Like that of his brother, it\r\nis a small half-length. He stands directly facing the spectator, the\r\nleft hand holding his buff-coloured gloves, and the right half hidden by\r\nthe heavy dark-brown cloak, with black velvet collar and velvet at the\r\nwrists, the folds of which are finely arranged and painted. This cloak\r\nlacks the customary fur collar. The white shirt, partly open and showing\r\nthe bare chest beneath, is tied in the front by long strings passed\r\nthrough a white button, and the embroidered collar is almost hidden by\r\nhis beard. A flat black cap is on his head, of the type worn by all the\r\nSteelyard merchants in Holbein’s portraits. The hair, beard, and long\r\nmoustache are fair, the separate hairs being indicated with almost\r\nmicroscopic care. The eyes are brown, the left one being decidedly\r\nsmaller than the right, and there is a corresponding difference in the\r\ndevelopment of the two sides of the face. There are no accessories of\r\nany kind, and upon the plain blue background, on either side of the\r\nhead, is inscribed, in gold letters: “ANNO. 1533.” and “ÆTATIS SVÆ. 39.”\r\nThe gold ring is enamelled in red, white and black, and in the circle\r\nround the coat of arms there are some letters now undecipherable. This\r\nis one of the finest and most sympathetic portraits ever painted by\r\nHolbein. The face, in spite of its slight irregularity, is one of great\r\ncharm and much sweetness of expression. The drawing of the hands and\r\nmouth is particularly fine.[39]\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 116. Reproduced by Dickes, p. 79; Knackfuss, fig. 121; Ganz,\r\n  _Holbein_, p. 98; and in colour in _Early German Painters_, folio v.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Dickes, who does not hesitate to suggest that a date has been\r\n  tampered with if it suits his argument to do so, regards this picture\r\n  as “an unmistakable portrait of the second person” in the\r\n  “Ambassadors” picture, such person being, in his opinion Philipp,\r\n  Count Palatine. This picture, he says, “has a damaged date, catalogued\r\n  as 1533, and a more clear “ætatis 34,” which is no doubt correct, for\r\n  the moustache shows five years’ more growth” (_i.e._ than in the\r\n  “Ambassadors”). “No one who compares the two faces can doubt the\r\n  identity, or that if of Philipp—born November 12, 1503, as indicated\r\n  in our picture—its correct date is 1538.” It requires a very vivid\r\n  imagination to see a likeness between Wedigh and the portrait of the\r\n  Bishop of Lavaur in the National Gallery group; but Mr. Dickes sees\r\n  Philipp and Otto Henry in so many portraits scattered about Europe,\r\n  having but the faintest resemblance to one another, and gives to\r\n  Holbein so many pictures he never painted, and takes from him at least\r\n  one of his finest works (the Morette in Dresden, which he calls Otto\r\n  Henry and attributes to Amberger) that his attribution with regard to\r\n  the Wedigh portrait is not worth serious consideration. The date upon\r\n  it is plainly enough 1533. At the time he was writing his book the age\r\n  of the sitter appeared to be “34,” but recent cleaning shows it to be\r\n  “39.” (Dickes, _Holbein’s “Ambassadors” Unriddled_, p. 81.)\r\n\r\nThree other portraits of Steelyard merchants bear the date 1533: Derich\r\nBorn at Windsor, Derich Tybis at Vienna, and Cyriacus Fallen at\r\nBrunswick. The portrait of Derich Born (Pl. 4 (1)),[40] in the royal\r\ncollection at Windsor Castle, painted when he was twenty-three, is,\r\nafter the “Gisze” and “Hermann Wedigh” portraits, perhaps the most\r\nattractive of the Steelyard series. It is slightly under life-size, the\r\nfigure shown nearly to the waist, turned to the right, and the head,\r\nupon which the light falls strongly from above on the right, nearly in\r\nfull-face. His right elbow rests on a stone ledge or parapet which runs\r\nacross the picture, the left hand placed across the right wrist, and a\r\ngold signet-ring with a coat of arms on his forefinger. He wears a flat\r\nblack cap, black silk dress, and a white shirt with a collar of\r\nso-called Spanish work of black silk thread, very delicately painted. He\r\nis beardless, and has chestnut-brown hair, cut straight across the\r\nforehead and hiding the ears in the customary fashion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 266.

BORN ETATIS SVÆ 23 ANNO 1533.”\r\n\r\nThe background is of a dark greenish blue against which stand out some\r\nbranches and leaves of a vine or fig tree. It is painted in cool and\r\ndelicate tones, with flesh tints of a pale brown, in which it bears a\r\nclose resemblance to the portrait of Georg Gisze. It is marked, too, by\r\nthe same simplicity and restraint, and air of quiet and dignified\r\nrepose, and searching truth and insight in the rendering of what must\r\nhave been a very attractive nature, qualities which make Holbein’s\r\nportraiture so great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL.

Mr. W. F. Dickes suggests that it represents the eldest son\r\nand successor of Theodorichus de Born, the printer, of Deventer and\r\nNimeguen, who issued the Netherland New Testament in 1532, and he quotes\r\na reference to a Theodorichus de Born de Novimagio acting as Secretary\r\nto the Faculty of Arts at Cologne University, and also to a Derichus de\r\nBorn who had a licence to preach. “Remembering,” he says, “that Erasmus\r\nspent his schooldays at Deventer, and that Holbein owed to him several\r\nof his introductions, I think my suggestion deserves to be considered.\r\nAt any rate, there is no necessity to assume, as is done without a\r\ntittle of evidence, that this young scholar was a member of the\r\nStahlhof! Nor does the presence of this portrait at Windsor prove that\r\nit was painted in England.”[41]\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Dickes, _Holbein_, &c., p. 6.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickes, whose chief object is to prove, for the purposes of his\r\ntheory about the “Ambassadors,” that none of these Steelyard portraits\r\nwas painted in England, starts by misquoting the inscription on the\r\npicture, which he gives as “Derichus si vocem addas de Born,” an\r\nextraordinary mixing of the first and third lines. There is no “de Born”\r\nin it, it is distinctly “Der. Born,” and though the young man depicted\r\nmay have been a member of Theodorichus de Born’s family, as he suggests,\r\nhe was certainly a member of the Steelyard, and known in London as\r\nDerich Born. In the Calendars of Letters and Papers, under the heading\r\nof “Ordnance,” a paper is printed which gives a list of “payments made\r\nby Erasmus Kyrkenar, the King’s armourer, by his Majesty’s command, from\r\n15th Sept, to 13th Oct. 28 Hen. VIII” (1536), for wages of armourers,\r\nand the providing of armour, harness, &c., in connection with the\r\nRebellion in the North. Among the items included in his account is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n“For various bundles of harness bought of Mr. Locke, merchant of London,\r\nand of _Dyrycke Borne, merchant of the Steelyard_,” &c.[42] This, though\r\nit does not actually prove him to have been in London in 1533, shows\r\nthat he was most certainly here three years later as a member of the\r\nSteelyard. Evidence of his presence in London in the years 1542-49 is to\r\nbe found in the _Inventare hansischer Archive des 16. Jahrhunderts, I_,\r\nquoted by Dr. Ganz,[43] who states that he was a merchant of Cologne.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xi. 686.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  _Holbein_, p. 240.\r\n\r\nThe picture is on oak, 1 ft. 11½ in. high by 1 ft. 7¼ in. wide. It was\r\nat one time in the Arundel collection, and is entered in the 1655\r\ninventory as “Derichius a Born.” It is possible that the earl owned more\r\nthan one of the Steelyard portraits, for there are two entries of\r\nportraits of men with black birettas. On the back is the brand of\r\nCharles I, “C.R.” crowned, though it is not described in his catalogue.\r\nThere is a second portrait of Derich Born by Holbein, a small oval of\r\nabout 3 in. high (9 × 8 mm.), on paper, in the Alte Pinakothek at\r\nMunich, giving the head and shoulders only.[44] It is painted in oil on\r\npaper, and has suffered somewhat from retouching, but is still an\r\nexcellent example of the small portraits in oil on wood or paper,\r\nusually enclosed in a case of wood or ivory, which Holbein was fond of\r\npainting at this period, closely akin to his true miniatures of a rather\r\nlater date. In the Munich version the position is reversed, the sitter\r\nbeing turned to the right, and the face not quite so fully to the front.\r\nThe workmanship, more particularly of the collar, is as fine as in the\r\nlarger Windsor portrait. His name and age and the date are given, but\r\nthe last figures and letters have been cut away, probably when fitting\r\nit into the frame, so that all that is left of the inscription on the\r\nbackground, on either side of the head, now reads:\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 220. Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 147.\r\n\r\n                    “DEBOR . .         .   .\r\n                     TATIS         SVÆ   .   .\r\n                     M. D.          XXX   .   .   .”\r\n\r\nThere is every probability that the completed date was 1533, and that\r\nthe little picture was produced at about the same time as the Windsor\r\nversion, though the sitter looks slightly younger, and while the more\r\nimportant work was painted for a place on the walls of the Hanse\r\nGuildhall, the lesser one may well have been done for sending to the\r\nsitter’s relations abroad. The Munich catalogue states that it is from\r\nthe Elector Palatine’s palace at Mannheim, but otherwise nothing is\r\nknown of its history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 4B\r\n  DERICH TYBIS\r\n  1533\r\n  IMPERIAL GALLERY, VIENNA\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF DERICH TYBIS]\r\n\r\nThe half-length portrait of Derich Tybis, of Duisburg (Pl. 4 (2)), about\r\nhalf the size of life, in the Vienna Gallery (No. 1485), is of the same\r\ndate, 1533.[45] It is a full-face representation of a young man, with\r\ndark brown eyes and hair, his double chin and upper lip being\r\nclean-shaven and tinged with blue. In his hands, which rest on a table\r\nin front of him, he is holding a letter which he is about to open. He\r\nwears the usual heavy, black, sleeveless cloak or overcoat, with a deep\r\ncollar of fur, and a smaller inner collar of lighter fur. The\r\nfore-sleeves of his under-dress are of dark-brown velvet. The open fur\r\ncollar allows a glimpse of a finely-pleated white shirt, with a\r\nneck-band of a conventional design of holly leaves worked in gold thread\r\nin place of the more usual black Spanish embroidery. He wears two rings\r\non the forefinger of his left hand, one with an oval green stone in a\r\nclaw setting. The table is covered with an olive-green cloth, and lying\r\nupon it are a second letter, a paper with an inscription, a seal,\r\nquill-pen, sealing-wax, and a circular inkstand in two divisions, with\r\nan ink-well in one half and some gold coins in the other.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 251. Reproduced by Knackfuss, fig. 120; Ganz, _Holbein_, p.\r\n  101; and in colour in _Early German Painters_, folio ii.\r\n\r\nThe picture has suffered some damage, more particularly in the colour.\r\nThe ground, which was originally azure blue, has turned to a greenish\r\ntone, and the shadows of the flesh are now too grey; but the masterly\r\ndraughtmanship is still there and the extraordinary insight into\r\ncharacter. Here again the fine and expressive hands at once attract\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe letter he holds in his hands is from his father, and is addressed\r\n“Dem ersamen Deryck tybis von Duysburch alwyl London vff wi ... dgyss\r\nmynem lesten Sun....” (“To the honourable Derich Tybis of Duisburg, at\r\nthe time in London, in Windgyss, my dear son”). This address shows that\r\nTybis was living in Windgoose Alley, one of the passage-ways running\r\nthrough the Steelyard, with the houses and shops of the members on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nOn the open paper lying on the table is inscribed, in imitation of the\r\nsitter’s handwriting:\r\n\r\n                           “_Jesus Christus._\r\n\r\n    “Da ick was 33 jar alt was ick Deryck Tybis to London dyser\r\n    gestalt en hab dyser gelicken den mark gesch[rieben] myt myner\r\n    eigenen Hant en was Holpein malt anno 1533. per my Deryck\r\n    [device here] Tybis fan Drys[burch].”\r\n\r\n    (“When I was 33 years old, I, Deryck Tybis, in London, had this\r\n    appearance, and I have marked this portrait with my device in my\r\n    own hand, and it was painted by Holbein in the year 1533, by me\r\n    Deryck (here stands the device) Tybis von Drys....”)\r\n\r\nThe device, a combination of crosses, is repeated on the seal on the\r\ntable, with the letters D.T., reversed, on either side of it. There is a\r\nsomewhat similar device on some of the letters in Georg Gisze’s\r\nportrait. The address on the second letter, lying in front of him, is\r\nnow almost illegible. There is no inscription on the background. The\r\nwriter has found no reference to Tybis in the English State Papers.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Steelyard portrait of 1533, that of Cyriacus Fallen, in the\r\nBrunswick Gallery,[46] is also a half-length, about half the size of\r\nlife. Like Derich Tybis, the sitter is shown full-face, looking at the\r\nspectator. His hair is cut in the customary Steelyard fashion, and he is\r\nclean-shaven. His black cap is set rather jauntily on one side, and his\r\nblack overcoat has a very heavy fur collar, while his fore-sleeves are\r\nof brown silk with a pattern, as in the Wedigh portrait. The neck of his\r\nwhite embroidered shirt is just visible over the collar. In his hands he\r\nholds his gloves and two letters, superscribed with his name and address\r\nin London. These addresses are not very legible. Dr. Woltmann at first\r\nsupposed the Christian name to be Ambrose, but further examination\r\nproved it to be Cyriacus. One of the inscriptions is: “Dem Ersamen\r\nsyryacussfalen zu luden vp Stalhoff sy disser briff”; and the other:\r\n“Dem Ersamen f. ... syriakus fallenn in Lunde ... stalhuff sy dies....”\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 126.

He is represented life-size, at half-length, and\r\nfull face, with brown hair and beard, and black dress and cap. Both\r\nhands are shown, and the left, resting on a table with a red cover,\r\nholds a letter addressed:—“Dem Ersame’ v[n]d fromen Derich berk i.\r\nLondon upt. Stalhoff,” together with the motto _besad dz end_ (“Consider\r\nthe end”), and the trade-mark of his business house. On the table is a\r\nslip of paper with the Latin motto, “Olim meminisse juvabit,” selected\r\nby Berck, says Dr. Ganz, to indicate that Holbein’s brush will secure\r\nhim immortality.[49] In the top right-hand corner are the date and the\r\nsitter’s age, “AN. 1536. ÆTA: 30” twice over, a later inscription being\r\npainted over the faded original one. The background is blue, with a\r\ngreen curtain on the left.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 241. First published by Dr. Ganz in _Burlington Magazine_,\r\n  October 1911, vol. xx. p. 33; Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 107.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  See _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xx. p. 32.\r\n\r\nThe writer has not seen this picture, but it is described as follows by\r\nDr. Ganz in the _Burlington Magazine_:—“The merchant’s cloth and cap are\r\nblack, but not dark; the heavy silk reflects the light in a greenish\r\ncolour finely observed. The background is blue, of the same blue as in\r\nthe portrait of Richard Southwell at Florence executed in the same year.\r\nIt is enriched by a green curtain with red strings, giving an\r\nopportunity for the artist—like the red cloth on the table—for\r\nintroducing other tones into his composition, such as black, besides the\r\nmain notes of blue and flesh colour. The brightest point in this\r\nprofound harmony of colours, a part of the white shirt with black\r\nembroidery, is placed just under the face and makes the fresh and lively\r\nexpression of it stronger. The light shines with a rare splendour over\r\nthis man’s healthy face and is reflected in the grey-blue eyes, which\r\nlook so frank and kindly.” This picture has suffered from over-painting,\r\nbut it remains a splendid and virile example of Holbein’s portraiture.\r\nThere is a poor copy of it in the Alte Pinakothek at Munich,[50]\r\npurchased in 1899 from a local picture-dealer. It had come originally\r\nfrom France, and was regarded as an unfinished portrait by Holbein of an\r\nunknown man. The Munich catalogue describes it as a school-replica.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 219.\r\n\r\nTo Holbein the Steelyard proved to be in all ways a fruitful source of\r\nincome. Not only was he busily engaged for some years in painting\r\nindividual members of the League, but he was also employed by them in\r\ntheir corporate capacity upon an important work of decoration for their\r\nGuildhall, and in at least one other direction. This decoration\r\nconsisted of two large allegorical paintings in tempera representing\r\n“The Triumph of Riches” and “The Triumph of Poverty.” No record exists\r\nas to the date of this work, but it is reasonable to suppose that the\r\ncommission was given him in 1532 or 1533, at the time when he was in\r\nconstant attendance within the precincts of the Steelyard for the\r\npurpose of painting some of its leading members in the midst of their\r\ndaily occupations.\r\n\r\nThese decorative paintings have long since disappeared, but the original\r\ndesign for “The Triumph of Riches” exists, as well as numerous copies of\r\nboth compositions, so that it is possible to gain some idea of their\r\nbeauty and importance. These allegories, which contained many life-size\r\nfigures, were not painted on the walls, but on canvas, and so easily\r\nremovable. They added greatly to the artist’s reputation in this\r\ncountry, and before the close of the sixteenth century they were\r\ncelebrated throughout Europe among artists and connoisseurs of painting.\r\nCarel von Mander says that Federigo Zuccaro, about the year 1574, made\r\ntwo drawings from them, and declared them to be equal to anything\r\naccomplished by Raphael, and that after his return to Italy he told\r\nGoltzius the painter that they were even finer than any wall-paintings\r\nfrom Raphael’s brush.\r\n\r\nThe two pictures remained in the Guildhall of the Steelyard until 1598,\r\nwhen it was closed by Queen Elizabeth, who at the same time expelled the\r\nGermans from their houses. For some years the place remained desolate,\r\nand when, in 1606, under James I, the buildings were restored to the\r\nLeague, most of the property left behind was found to have been stolen\r\nor badly damaged. The glory and prosperity of the Steelyard, indeed, had\r\ncompletely vanished, never to be fully restored again, and when the\r\naffairs of the Company in London were finally wound up, the two pictures\r\nwere presented by the League, through their representative, the\r\nhouse-master, Holtscho, on January 22nd, 1616 (old style) to Henry,\r\nPrince of Wales, like his brother, Charles I, a patron of the fine arts.\r\nHoltscho, in describing the event, says: “I cannot, also, leave it\r\nunnoticed, that although these works are old, and have lost their\r\nfreshness, yet His Highness, as a lover of painting, and as the works of\r\nthe master, specially this work, have been highly commended, has taken\r\ngreat pleasure in them, as I have myself perceived, and have also heard\r\nfrom himself.”[51] The researches of Dr. Lappenberg have placed these\r\nfacts beyond doubt, thus disproving the old legend that the pictures\r\nwere destroyed when still hanging on the walls of the banqueting-hall of\r\nthe Easterlings during the Great Fire in 1666.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. 381, quoting from Lappenberg, _Urkundliche Geschichte des\r\n  hansischen Stahlhofes zu London_, 1851, pp. 82-87.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TWO “TRIUMPHS”]\r\n\r\nIt has been generally supposed that on the death of Prince Henry, two\r\nyears after they were presented to him, the pictures passed into the\r\npossession of Charles I; and as they were not included among the\r\npictures of that King’s collection sold by order of the Commonwealth in\r\n1648-53, Dr. Lappenberg concluded that they must have remained at\r\nWhitehall until destroyed in the fire at that palace in 1698. Further\r\nevidence, however, appears to contradict this conclusion. In Van der\r\nDoort’s carefully-prepared catalogue of Charles I’s collection, although\r\nseveral less important works by Holbein are included, among them two\r\nminiatures, these two celebrated pictures are not mentioned. Again,\r\nSandrart, in his autobiography, describes the two compositions in some\r\ndetail, after seeing them in 1627 in the Earl of Arundel’s possession,\r\nin the long garden gallery in Arundel House. He does not say whether\r\nthey were pictures or drawings, so that they may have been only the\r\noriginal designs; it is much more probable, however, that they were the\r\nlarge paintings, as Sandrart speaks of them first of all, as the chief\r\nof Holbein’s works belonging to the Earl, and afterwards describes three\r\nof his best known portraits, hanging in the same gallery, those of\r\nErasmus, Sir Thomas More, and a “Princess of Lorraine” (the Duchess of\r\nMilan), which seems to indicate that Lord Arundel possessed the large\r\nworks. It has been suggested that they may have been presented by\r\nCharles I to the Earl; but it is more likely that they were obtained by\r\nexchange with that monarch. Later on they were taken abroad with the\r\nrest of the collection by the Countess of Arundel, and were in Amsterdam\r\nat the time of her death in 1654. In the inventory then drawn up they\r\nare merely described as “Triumpho della Richezza” and “Triumpho della\r\nPoverta.” Probably they were among the pictures hastily sold by Lord\r\nStafford in that town immediately after his mother’s decease.[52] The\r\nlast trace of their history to be found is in a paragraph in Félibien’s\r\n_Entretiens sur les Vies et sur les Ouvrages des plus excellents\r\nPeintres anciens et modernes_, published in 1666, in which he speaks of\r\nthem as having been brought from Flanders to Paris: “Il y avait encore\r\ndans la maison des Ostrelins, dans la salle du Convive, deux tableaux à\r\ndétrempe, qu’on a veûs icy depuis quelques années, et qu’on avait\r\nenvoyez de Flandres.”[53]\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  See _Burlington Magazine_, August 1911, vol. xix. pp. 282-6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Woltmann, i. p. 382.\r\n\r\nIf Félibien is correct, the pictures had once more come into the\r\npossession of the Hanseatic League. They were, no doubt, purchased in\r\nAmsterdam by that body, and forwarded to Paris. No further record of\r\nthem has been discovered, and as they were already in a damaged state\r\nwhen presented to the Prince of Wales, the probability is that they have\r\nperished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 6\r\n  THE TRIUMPH OF RICHES\r\n  Design for the wall-decoration in the Guildhall of the London\r\n    Steelyard Merchants _Pen-and-wash drawing heightened with white_\r\n  LOUVRE, PARIS\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TWO “TRIUMPHS”]\r\n\r\nHolbein’s original sketch for “The Triumph of Riches,” a masterly pen\r\ndrawing washed with Indian-ink, and touched with white in the high\r\nlights, is in the Louvre (#Pl. 6#).[54] A similar drawing in the British\r\nMuseum, purchased in 1854, which at one time was attributed to Holbein\r\nhimself, is said by Woltmann to be a tracing of the Louvre example; but\r\nit has no appearance of being traced, and is certainly a copy, perhaps\r\nby an Italian.[55] The heads and attributes are given a Raphaelesque\r\nair, strikingly different from the Flemish style of a second drawing in\r\nthe Museum, of the second composition, “The Triumph of Poverty.”[56]\r\nThis latter is in black and red chalks and pen, washed with Indian-ink,\r\nand heightened with white, on a blue background, and was acquired in\r\n1894 from the Eastlake collection. Lady Eastlake possessed a similar\r\ndrawing of the “Riches.” Both are in all probability by Lucas Vorsterman\r\nthe younger, and were purchased by Sir Charles Eastlake from the Walpole\r\nsale in 1842 for sixteen guineas. They appear to be copies, as Vertue\r\nsuggested, made for engraving purposes by Lucas Vorsterman from the\r\ndrawings done by Zuccaro in 1574; or possibly from the original\r\npaintings when in Amsterdam. Vorsterman certainly engraved one, if not\r\nboth subjects, though only his engraving of the “Poverty” is known.\r\nThese drawings,[57] at one time in the Lely collection, were in\r\nBuckingham House, before it was purchased for a royal palace, and were\r\nsold as allegorical works by Van Dyck, and bought by Horace Walpole, who\r\nregarded the “Riches” as by Vorsterman, and the “Poverty” as by Zuccaro;\r\nbut the latter, like the former, is decidedly Flemish in style.[58]\r\nSandrart possessed copies, in all probability those made by Zuccaro,\r\nwhich were afterwards in the Crozat collection, and when that collection\r\nwas sold passed into that of Privy Councillor Fleischmann, of Strasburg,\r\nand while in his possession were engraved for Von Mechel’s “œuvres de\r\nJean Holbein,” and inscribed “Zuccari delin. 1574.” All further traces\r\nof these Zuccaro drawings have now been lost.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 233.

Wornum, i. p. 89. Dr. Ganz, however,\r\n  regards the “Poverty” as Zuccaro’s copy. See _Holbein_, p. 248.\r\n\r\nThe British Museum possesses a very rare and interesting engraving,\r\ndated 1561,[59] and inscribed “Faicte par Maistre Hans Holbeyn tres\r\nexcellent pointre. Et imprime par Johan Borg^{ni} Floret^o en Anuers lan\r\nM·D·LXI.” It is evidently taken from Holbein’s original design, which\r\nmust have been in Antwerp at that date. Larger copies of both paintings\r\nare also in the British Museum; they are by Jan de Bisschop, a Dutch\r\nartist who died in 1686, and were probably made from the original large\r\ncompositions when they were in Amsterdam. They are pen drawings washed\r\nwith bistre, and are executed with great detail (#Pl. 7#).[60] The\r\n“Riches” shows several minor differences and some additions when\r\ncompared with the Louvre drawing. Two new characters are introduced,\r\n_Phileas_ and _Leo Pisanus_, their heads appearing before and behind the\r\ncharioteer, as well as _Heliogabalus_ and some unnamed persons; there is\r\na parrot on the tree in the background (as in the Vorsterman drawing),\r\nwhile the tree itself is much larger and more finished. All goes to\r\nprove, in short, that the Louvre drawing and the copy of it in the\r\nBritish Museum represent Holbein’s study for the painting, while the\r\nBisschop drawings were made from the paintings themselves, and the\r\nVorsterman drawings either from the finished works or from Zuccaro’s\r\ncopies of them, and represent the final designs.[61] The British Museum\r\npossesses a third copy of the “Triumph of Poverty,” made by Matthäus\r\nMerian the Younger in 1640, when the picture was still in London.[62]\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 175.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  Both reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, pp. 176-7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  See the British Museum Catalogue, i. p. 343.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  A small version of the “Riches” until recently belonged to Mr. Edwin\r\n  Seward, F.R.I.B.A., of Cardiff.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted in an earlier chapter that Holbein, in his\r\nwall-paintings, was influenced by the example of Andrea Mantegna, whose\r\n“Triumph of Cæsar” had a European reputation. The Steelyard allegories\r\nwere compositions of a similar nature, though in no sense copies of any\r\nearlier Italian work. The “Triumph of Riches” represents a crowded\r\nprocession moving towards the spectator’s left. The magnificent chariot\r\nof Plutus, drawn by four white horses, is followed and surrounded by the\r\nmost famous men of wealth of antiquity. The god of riches himself, old,\r\nbent, and bald, is seated on a high seat at the back of the car, with\r\nhis feet on a sack of gold. In front of him sits Fortune on a globe,\r\nblindfolded,[63] her veil blown out like a sail, and stooping down to\r\nscatter gold among the crowd; and in front of her sits the Charioteer,\r\nnamed _Ratio_, holding the reins, which are labelled _Notitia_ and\r\n_Voluntas_. The two near horses, _Impostura_ and _Contractus_, are led\r\nby _Bona Fides_ and _Justitia_, two finely designed figures of women,\r\nwhile two other women, _Liberalitas_ and _Æqualitas_, are mounted on the\r\noff horses, _Avaritia_ and _Usura_, which they urge along with short\r\nwhips. On either side of the chariot walk Simonides, Sichaeus, Leo\r\nByzantius, Bassa, Themistocles, Pythius, Crispinus, Ventidius, who holds\r\nup his toga to catch the coins Fortune is scattering, Gadareus and\r\nothers, some of them bent down with the weight of gold they are carrying\r\nin sacks or large purses. Behind the car rides Crœsus, a majestic,\r\ncrowned figure, his horse led by Narcissus, with Cleopatra, Midas,\r\nTantalus, and other riders bringing up the rear. On the extreme right of\r\nthe composition _Nemesis_ hovers over them in the clouds. To each figure\r\na label with the name is attached, all of which are not given on the\r\nLouvre drawing, but are found in the Vorsterman and Bisschop copies. On\r\nthe extreme left, in the sky, is a large cartellino,[64] with a Latin\r\ninscription of two lines in Roman characters:—\r\n\r\n              “Avrvm blanditiæ pater est natvsq. doloris\r\n               Qvi caret hoc moeret qvi tenet hic metvit.”\r\n\r\nThis sentence was also written up over the central door of the Steelyard\r\nGuildhall, and has been ascribed, according to Walpole, to Sir Thomas\r\nMore, but this appears to be a legend without any real foundation in\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  In the original drawing. In the Bisschop copy her head is raised, and\r\n  she is not blindfolded.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Not shown in the Louvre drawing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 7\r\n  THE TRIUMPH OF POVERTY\r\n  Seventeenth-century copy of the wall-decoration in the Guildhall of\r\n    the London Merchants of the Steelyard\r\n  By JAN DE BISSCHOP\r\n  BRITISH MUSEUM\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE “TRIUMPH OF POVERTY”]\r\n\r\nBoth compositions were of the same height, but the “Triumph of Riches”\r\nwas much the longer of the two, so that they must have been painted to\r\nfill particular and prescribed wall-spaces in the Hall. Probably the\r\n“Riches” occupied the place of honour on one of the long walls, opposite\r\nthe windows, with the “Poverty” at one of the ends of the room. The\r\nlatter, according to Dr. Ganz, came first, as the heads of a number of\r\nthe figures in the foreground are turned backwards as though looking\r\nacross the room at the other procession following them. In the “Triumph\r\nof Poverty,” in which the procession moves in the same direction, from\r\nright to left, the central figure is Poverty, an old woman, lean, and\r\nbare to the waist, seated in a rough waggon with upright poles bearing a\r\ncanopy of straw. Over her head is a label with the Greek title “Πενια.”\r\nBehind her sits _Infortunium_, striking with a rod at the heads of the\r\ncrowd of poverty-stricken, half-naked figures following the cart, among\r\nwhom are an old man, _Mendicitas_, and an old woman, _Miseria_. In front\r\nof Poverty sits _Industria_, distributing instruments of labour,\r\nhammers, chisels, flails, squares, and other tools to the poor workmen\r\nwalking below, and she is supported by _Usus_ and _Memoria_. The cart is\r\ndriven by _Spes_, who looks up towards heaven, and is drawn by two oxen,\r\n_Negligentia_ and _Pigritia_, in the shafts, and two asses, _Stupiditas_\r\nand _Ignavia_, as leaders. These steeds are led by four finely designed\r\nfemale figures, _Moderatio_, with a whip, _Diligentia_, _Solicitudo_,\r\nand _Labor_, the last carrying a heavy spade. Behind _Labor_ walks a\r\nyoung man with a basket of carpenter’s tools, and a flail over his\r\nshoulder. On a tree in the left background hangs a large wooden tablet\r\nwith a long Latin inscription, also attributed to Sir Thomas More,\r\nbeginning:\r\n\r\n         “Mortalivm jvcvnditas volvcris et pendvla\r\n          Movetvr instar tvrbinis quam nix agit sedvla,” &c.[65]\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  The lines are quoted in full by Wornum, p. 265, and Woltmann, i. p.\r\n  385.\r\n\r\nFrom the Louvre sketch in particular, but also from the numerous more or\r\nless faithful copies, sufficient evidence of the fine decorative\r\ncharacter of the originals, their sense of rhythmic movement, their\r\ncreative power and imagination, and the nobility of their design, can be\r\nobtained. The allegories they set forth were plain enough to read. They\r\npointed out the instability of fortune and glory, and the virtue to be\r\nfound in honest poverty, and warned the merchants who daily looked upon\r\nthem, and whose avocations were the making of money, against undue\r\narrogance in prosperity or needless despondency in adversity. “Both\r\npieces,” says Van Mander, who describes them with some care, “were\r\nexcellently arranged, freely drawn, and well delineated.” The\r\ncolour-scheme appears to have matched the fine decorative qualities of\r\nthe design. The compositions were not carried out in natural colours as\r\nin a picture. They were painted in greyish monochrome, with colour\r\nsparingly used. The background was blue, green was used in the trees,\r\nand the horses which drew the chariot of Plutus were white. The flesh\r\ntints of the numerous figures were rendered naturally, but the garments\r\nthey wore were in monochrome, ornamented at the borders with gold, which\r\nwas also used in other parts of the canvas with excellent effect, so\r\nthat the paintings, when in position on the walls, must have added to\r\nthe rich and brilliant appearance of the room, with its sideboards\r\ncovered with silver plate and pewter ware.\r\n\r\nWe have one other record of a commission given to Holbein by the\r\nSteelyard. This was the design for the triumphal arch which they erected\r\non Saturday, May 31st, 1533, when Anne Boleyn rode in procession from\r\nthe Tower through the City to Westminster for her coronation. From a\r\nletter written by Chapuys, the Imperial Ambassador in London, to Charles\r\nV, dated May 18th in that year, it is evident that the Germans were not\r\nanxious to incur the cost of this decoration; but the Londoners, who had\r\ncontributed 5000 ducats towards the festivities, of which 3000 were for\r\na present to the new Queen, were determined to make all the inhabitants,\r\nirrespective of nationality, pay their due share.\r\n\r\n“The Easterlings,” says Chapuys, “as being subjects of your Majesty,\r\nwould like to be excused, but the great privileges they enjoy here\r\nprevent them from objecting.”[66]\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. vi. 508.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “APOLLO AND THE MUSES”]\r\n\r\nHaving determined to do it, however, they did it well, as contemporary\r\nrecords bear witness. Stow tells us that Anne, after being greeted at\r\nFenchurch Street by the children of the City Schools, was still more\r\nsplendidly welcomed at the corner of Gracechurch Street, “where was a\r\ncostly and marvellous cunning pageant made by the merchants of the\r\nStilyard: therein was the Mount Parnassus, with the Fountaine of\r\nHelicon, which was of white marble, and four streames without pipe did\r\nrise an ell high, and mette together in a little cup above the\r\nfountaine, which fountaine ranne abundantly with Reynish wine till\r\nnight. On the mountaine sat _Apollo_, and at his feete sate _Caliope_;\r\nand on every side of the mountaine sate four Muses, playing on severell\r\nsweet instruments, and all their jestes, epigrams, and poesies were\r\nwrytten in golden letters, in the which every Muse, according to her\r\nproperty, praysed the Queene.” Camusat, in his narrative, says: “In all\r\nopen places were scaffolds, on which mysteries were played; and\r\nfountains poured forth wine. Along the streets all the merchants were\r\nstationed.”\r\n\r\nThis triumphal arch was designed by Holbein. His original sketch for it,\r\nformerly in the Crozat collection, and more recently in that of the late\r\nHerr Rudolph Weigel, of Leipzig, is now in the Berlin Print Room (#Pl.\r\n8#).[67] In its details it corresponds almost exactly with Stow’s\r\ndescription. In the centre Apollo is seated on a rock, beneath a slight\r\nbower or baldachin consisting of thin pillars supporting slender arches\r\nwreathed with leaves, across which hangs a scroll-shaped tablet for an\r\ninscription, the whole surmounted by a two-headed Imperial eagle. Apollo\r\nholds a small harp on his left knee, and with his right hand directs the\r\nmusic of the attendant Muses, who are grouped beneath him, five on the\r\nleft hand and four on the right, on either side of a fountain of fine\r\nRenaissance design, in which the wine is falling from the smaller upper\r\nbasin into the larger one beneath. The two front figures, Calliope and\r\nPolyhymnia, are seated, with lute and viol. Four of the others are\r\nsinging, and the remainder playing various musical instruments, one with\r\nboth a trumpet and a small drum. Apollo, crowned with a wreath, is clad\r\nin classical costume, but the ladies are wearing dresses of Holbein’s\r\nday. On either side of the group rise two tall candelabra, with blank\r\nshields for coats of arms, surmounted with royal crowns. In the\r\nbackground rocky mountains are indicated. The whole composition is\r\nsupported by a central arch, of rich Renaissance design, shown in\r\nperspective, with a large blank tablet, to contain words of welcome, at\r\nits crown, and there are indications of smaller arches on either side.\r\nThus it is evident that the decoration was not a painted one, but was a\r\nsolid structure built across the street, under which the royal carriage\r\nwould pass, and that Apollo and the Muses were represented by living\r\npersons, who played their instruments as the procession went by, while\r\nthe white marble fountain splashed its Rhenish wine.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 175. Reproduced by Ganz, _Hdz. von H. H. dem Jüng._, Pl. 30,\r\n  and in _Holbein_, p. 178; Davies, p. 146; His, Pl. 51.\r\n\r\nThe sketch is a very hasty one, but would be quite sufficient to\r\nindicate to the Steelyard the artist’s intentions. Holbein himself, no\r\ndoubt, superintended the erection of the archway. Slight as it is, it is\r\nmasterly in draughtsmanship, displaying Holbein’s delicacy and certainty\r\nof touch in every stroke. The two seated figures, more particularly the\r\none on the right, are rapidly drawn with the greatest grace and charm.\r\nAccording to Woltmann the Imperial eagle on the summit has only one\r\nhead; the drawing is rubbed at the top, but there seem to be indications\r\nthat the split or two-headed bird, which was then customary, was\r\nintended. Mr. W. F. Dickes denies that this drawing was intended for the\r\nSteelyard arch; he considers it to be a sketch for one of the Apollo\r\nmusical festivals of Holbein’s Guild “zum Himmel” at Basel, and uses it\r\nas a proof that the painter had returned to his adopted city in\r\n1533.[68] He bases this on an entry in the Banner Book of the Guild,\r\ndated November 23rd, 1533, which he reads as a payment to Holbein for\r\nbanners painted for some festivity.[69] The symbol of the Basel\r\nPainters’ Guild was a pigeon with outstretched wings, within a wreath or\r\nbower, and Mr. Dickes sees in the eagle of the Berlin drawing, which is\r\nnot within a bower, the pigeon of the Guild. He states, too, that as the\r\nHanseatic League included merchants of other than German nationality\r\nthey would have been unwilling to use an emblem so limiting as the\r\nImperial bird. This statement is, however, incorrect. No doubt exists as\r\nto the use of the eagle on this particular occasion. It was, indeed,\r\nviewed with extreme distaste by the new Queen. Eustace Chapuys, writing\r\nto Charles V on July 11th, less than six weeks after the event, says: “I\r\nunderstand the lady (_i.e._, Anne) complains daily of the Easterlings,\r\nwho on the day of her entry had set the Imperial eagle predominant over\r\nthe King’s arms and hers.... This may serve as an indication of her\r\nperverse and malicious nature.”[70] And again, on the 30th of the same\r\nmonth, he returns to the same subject: “... the Lady who, as I am told,\r\nwas not at all pleased with the Easterlings and other Germans for\r\nbringing me to see their fleet, which is greater than any that has been\r\nseen here for a long time; or that, at a solemn banquet which they made,\r\nthe ships did march with their artillery. She is in a still worse humour\r\nbecause this was done near Greenwich park; and this has renewed the\r\nregret she felt for the eagle which the Easterlings carried in triumph\r\nthe day of her entry here.”[71] These letters afford additional evidence\r\nthat Holbein made this drawing for the occasion of Anne’s coronation,\r\nand that it has nothing to do with Basel or the Zunft zum Himmel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  Dickes, _Holbein’s “Ambassadors” Unriddled_, p. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  This point is dealt with in a later chapter.

The old device had disappeared in\r\nthe course of time, but in 1670 a new one was placed in position. The\r\nfollowing item occurs in a series of accounts still extant in connection\r\nwith the Steelyard buildings of that period: “December 31st, 1670. To\r\nGabriel Cibbert, stone-cutter,—for the eagle put on over the gate from\r\nThames Street, fixed on John Balls buildings, £5.” Caius Gabriel Cibber,\r\na native of Holstein, and father of Colley Cibber, was a sculptor of\r\nsome merit who practised in London. This sculptured shield-shaped stone,\r\nbearing an eagle displayed with a crowned collar and two heads,\r\nsurrounded by an inscription, was also removed in course of time, and\r\nwas recently found by Mr. Lawrence Weaver in the garden of Bickley Hall,\r\nKent.[72]\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  See Dr. Philip Norman’s paper, already quoted, in _Archæologia_, vol.\r\n  lxi. pt. 2, p. 406, in which the shield is reproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n                      “THE TWO AMBASSADORS,” 1533\r\n\r\nHolbein receives the offer of a yearly pension from the Basel Town\r\n  Council—“The Two Ambassadors”—The identity of the sitters—History and\r\n  description of the picture—Other portraits of Dinteville and the\r\n  members of his family—Félix Chrétien—Mr. Dickes’ theory that the\r\n  picture represents the Princes Palatine Otto Henry and Philipp—The\r\n  “Portrait of a Musician” at Bulstrode Park.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGHOUT the earlier years of Holbein’s second sojourn in England,\r\nthough he was busily occupied on work for the German merchants of the\r\nSteelyard, his time was by no means completely taken up with the\r\ncommissions they gave him both individually and as a corporate body.\r\nDuring the same period he painted the portraits of more than one\r\nEnglishman and several foreigners of distinction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LETTER OF RECALL FROM BASEL]\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, he probably returned to England during the first\r\nmonths of 1532. It is to be presumed that he arrived thus early—or even\r\nin the late autumn of the previous year—or otherwise it is difficult to\r\naccount for the letter of recall, dated 2nd September 1532, which was\r\nsent to him in England by the Burgomaster of Basel, Jakob Meyer—not his\r\nold patron, Meyer zum Hasen, but Jakob Meyer zum Hirschen—on behalf of\r\nthe Council. Such a letter would hardly have been written if he had been\r\nabsent from Basel for only a month or two. It is probable that the best\r\npart of a year would be allowed to elapse before a recall was sent to\r\nhim. It runs as follows:\r\n\r\n“Master Hans Holbein, the painter, now in England.\r\n\r\n“We, Jacob Meiger, Burgomaster, and the Council of the City of Basel,\r\nsend greeting to our dear citizen, Hans Holbein, and let you herewith\r\nknow that it would please us if you would repair home as soon as\r\npossible. In that case, in order that you may the better stay at home\r\nand support your wife and children, we will furnish you yearly with\r\nthirty pieces of money, until we are able to take care of you better.\r\n\r\nWe have wished to inform you of this, in order that you may conform to\r\nour desire. Dated Monday, 2nd September 1532.”[73]\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, English translation, p. 336. Original text in Woltmann, i.\r\n  363, and Wornum, p. 265.\r\n\r\nThe offer contained in this letter, which, though its terms were not\r\nlavish, was a proof that his fellow-citizens appreciated his art and\r\nwere anxious to induce him to reside permanently in Basel, was not\r\ntempting enough to induce Holbein to leave England. Whatever his answer\r\nmay have been—for it is to be presumed that he received the letter,\r\nthough there is no actual evidence to show that he did so—the Council’s\r\nrequest proved ineffectual. He must have felt that it would be folly to\r\nabandon regular and remunerative employment in London for doubtful and\r\nill-paid municipal commissions in Switzerland, more particularly as he\r\nhad so recently formed a new and lucrative connection with the\r\nSteelyard, while memories of the bad times lately encountered in Basel\r\nwere still vivid.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, the only three portraits by him bearing the date\r\n1532 are of German merchants. In the following year, however, more than\r\none fine work affords proof that the Steelyard was by no means his only\r\nsource of income. His most important undertaking in 1533 was the large\r\ndouble portrait generally known as “The Two Ambassadors,” now in the\r\nNational Gallery, for which it was purchased, in 1890, with two other\r\npictures, from the fifth Earl of Radnor, for £55,000, of which £25,000\r\nwas contributed by the State, and £30,000 by Messrs. Nathaniel\r\nRothschild & Sons, Lord Iveagh, and Mr. Charles Cotes. The addition of\r\nthis great painting to the national collections, in which, until then,\r\nHolbein had been unrepresented, aroused much curiosity as to the\r\npersonality of the two sitters. Many attempts were made to identify\r\nthem, and numerous solutions of the riddle were suggested in letters to\r\nthe _Times_ and other papers and reviews. Magazine articles were written\r\nabout it, and, lastly, two volumes of considerable size were published\r\nwith this picture as their sole subject. Probably no other painting in\r\nthe world has produced so great a mass of literature.\r\n\r\nThe two men represented are Frenchmen: Jean de Dinteville, Lord of\r\nPolisy, and Bailly of Troyes, and, at the time the picture was painted,\r\nresident French ambassador in London, and his close friend George de\r\nSelve, afterwards Bishop of Lavaur, who came over to England in the\r\nspring of 1533 on a short visit to the Bailly. The painting (#Pl.\r\n9#),[74] which is on ten vertical panels of oak, is 6 ft. 10 in. high by\r\n6 ft. 10¼ in. wide, and is thus described in the National Gallery\r\ncatalogue:\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 215.

II., PLATE 9\r\n  THE TWO AMBASSADORS\r\n  Jean de Dinteville and George de Selve\r\n  1533\r\n  NATIONAL GALLERY, LONDON\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The scene is a chamber paved with inlaid marbles, and hung with green\r\ndamask, which in the upper left-hand corner partly reveals a silver\r\ncrucifix attached to the wall behind. In the centre of the composition\r\nis a wooden stand, having an upper and a lower shelf. To the left of\r\nthis, leaning his arm upon it, stands Jean de Dinteville, a young man\r\nwith dark-brown eyes and beard, in a rich costume of the period of\r\nHenry VIII, wearing a heavy gold chain with the badge of the French\r\norder of Saint-Michel, and, on his right side, depending from his\r\ngirdle, a dagger with wrought gold hilt and sheath: on the sheath the\r\ninscription—ÆT. SVÆ 29. in relief. In his black bonnet is a jewel\r\nformed of a silver skull set in gold. To the right, George de Selve,\r\ndark-eyed, with a close beard, also leans upon the stand, or, more\r\nimmediately, on a clasped book, the edges of which are inscribed:\r\nÆTATIS SVÆ 25. He wears a four-cornered black cap, and a loose,\r\nlong-sleeved gown of mulberry and black brocade, lined with sable, and\r\nreaching to the ground. Both these persons regard the spectator. The\r\nupper shelf of the stand is covered with a Turkish rug, on which are\r\nseveral mathematical and astronomical instruments, and, close to the\r\nprincipal personage, a celestial globe. The lower shelf bears a case\r\nof flutes, a lute, an open music-book containing part of the score and\r\nwords of the Lutheran hymn, ‘Komm, heiliger Geist,’ a smaller book, on\r\narithmetic, kept partly open by a small square, a pair of compasses,\r\nand a terrestrial hand-globe, which is in a direct line below the\r\nother globe. Under the stand lies the lute-case. Conspicuous in the\r\nforeground is the _anamorphosis_, or perspectively distorted image, of\r\na human skull, which, touching the floor on the left, stretches\r\nobliquely upwards towards the right. In the shadow cast on the floor\r\nby the chief personage is the inscription—‘JOANNES HOLBEIN PINGEBAT\r\n1533’ in sloping Roman letters.” To this it should be added that\r\nDinteville’s dress consists of a slashed doublet of rose-coloured\r\nsatin, and a black surcoat. The latter is lined with ermine, with\r\nwhich the shoulder-puffs, further adorned with gold tags, are piped. A\r\nlarge gold and green silk tassel, of very fine execution, hangs, with\r\nthe dagger, from his girdle, and he also wears a sword, only the hilt\r\nand sheathed point of which are seen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HISTORY OF THE PICTURE]\r\n\r\nAll that was known about the picture at the time of its purchase for the\r\nNational Gallery was that at the end of the eighteenth century it was in\r\nthe possession of Jean Batiste Pierre Le Brun, the Parisian\r\npicture-dealer, and husband of the well-known portrait-painter, Madame\r\nVigée Le Brun. Le Brun issued a very indifferent engraving of it by J.\r\nA. Pierron in Part XII (dated 1790) of his “Galerie des Peintres\r\nFlamands, Hollandais et Allemands.” In the index it was described as\r\nrepresenting “MM. de Selve et d’Avaux; l’un, Ambassadeur à Venise,\r\nl’autre, dans les pays du Nord, avec les attributs des Arts qu’ils\r\ncultivaient; on voit à terre une Tête de Mort en perspective, à prendre\r\nde l’angle gauche, qui de face ressemble à un poisson.” When the\r\npublication was issued in volume form in 1792, with text, Le Brun\r\nslightly amplified this note, and added “J’ai depuis vendu ce tableau\r\npour l’Angleterre, où il est maintenant; les figures sont de grandeur\r\nnaturelle.” He gives no information as to the source from which he\r\nobtained the picture. It is stated in the National Gallery catalogue\r\nthat it is probable that it came into the hands of the dealer\r\nVandergucht, and that from him it was purchased by the second Earl of\r\nRadnor, about 1790 or 1795; but from the account books of Longford\r\nCastle it would appear that it was sold to the Earl by the dealer\r\nBuchanan, who received one thousand guineas for it, the payments being\r\nmade in 1808 and 1809.\r\n\r\nDuring the years the picture remained in Longford Castle many guesses\r\nwere made as to the identity of the personages. Le Brun’s title, which,\r\nafter all, contained half the truth, was not accepted by the leading\r\ncritics, largely owing, no doubt, to the fact that the title of Avaux\r\ndid not exist until more than a hundred years after the picture was\r\npainted, so that, the one name being impossible, the other was included\r\nin the same category. In the end, a suggestion that the man on the left\r\nof the picture was Sir Thomas Wyat was regarded as a very possible\r\nsolution. Mr. Wornum, in his book published in 1867, gave this\r\nattribution a qualified acceptance—“the subject is doubtful, but it is\r\nsupposed to represent Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet and diplomatist, and\r\nsome learned friend”[75]—and Dr. Woltmann followed suit, but went a step\r\nfurther, suggesting John Leland, the antiquary, as the second\r\nfigure.[76] Both identifications, however, were shown to be inaccurate\r\nby Mr. J. Gough Nichols in a paper contributed to _Archæologia_ in\r\n1873;[77] but he could offer no name in substitution, and so the matter\r\nstood until the purchase of the picture for the nation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 275.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. 374.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  _Archæologia_, vol. xliv. pt. ii. pp. 450-55.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE IDENTITY OF THE SITTERS]\r\n\r\nThe public exhibition of this splendid example of Holbein’s art produced\r\na long and interesting correspondence in the _Times_ newspaper. Sir J.\r\nC. Robinson upheld Dr. Woltmann’s belief that the two men were Wyat and\r\nLeland, but Sir Sidney Colvin,[78] by means of convincing proofs, showed\r\nthat this attribution was untenable, as also that of Le Brun. He gave,\r\nat the same time, four reasons for supposing that the personage on the\r\nleft was really a Frenchman and an ambassador—(1) the traditional title;\r\n(2) its having been sold into this country from France; (3) the wearing\r\nof the French order of Saint-Michel; and (4) the close resemblance in\r\ndress and fashion of the personage in question and the portrait of\r\nanother French Ambassador, the “Morette” at Dresden. He proposed, as a\r\nprobable solution, the name of Jean de Dinteville—a suggestion which\r\nafterwards proved to be the correct one. When, in August 1891, the\r\npicture was cleaned, and the name of Polisy, Dinteville’s birthplace, an\r\nobscure village in Burgundy, was discovered on the terrestrial globe,\r\nthe only other French towns upon it being Paris, Lyon and Bayonne, the\r\nidentity of the left-hand figure was placed almost beyond doubt. Sir\r\nSidney also suggested that the second person might be Nicolas Bourbon,\r\nthe French poet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  _The Times_, September 1890.\r\n\r\nOther attempted identifications included such divers personages as Lord\r\nRochford, brother of Anne Boleyn; Count Balthazar Castiglione, who came\r\nto England to receive the Order of the Garter for the Duke of Urbino;\r\nand Guillaume and Jean du Bellay. The last-named solution was published\r\nin a pamphlet in 1890 by Mr. Elias Dexter, under the title of _Holbein’s\r\nAmbassadors Identified_. The writer sought to prove that the National\r\nGallery picture and the one engraved for Le Brun were not the same, and\r\nthat there must be two versions of the subject in existence. This\r\ncontention he based on a number of slight differences between the\r\naccessories in the picture and in Pierron’s print, but such differences\r\nmay be easily explained by the inferiority of the engraver’s work and\r\nthe unusual complexity of the many details. To prove the identity of the\r\ntwo sitters with the brothers Du Bellay, who in 1533 were about 42 and\r\n41 years of age respectively, he was obliged to declare the inscriptions\r\non the dagger and the book to be forgeries. It is true that Jean du\r\nBellay was in England in that year for a short time, and this is Mr.\r\nDexter’s sole evidence, though he professes to see a strong likeness\r\nbetween the two ambassadors and the portraits of the brothers Du Bellay\r\nengraved on the same plate in the ninth volume of the _Versailles\r\nGallery_.\r\n\r\nA much more elaborate theory was advanced by Mr. W. F. Dickes in three\r\narticles in the _Magazine of Art_, and in several letters to the _Times_\r\nin answer to critics unfriendly to his attempted solution of the riddle.\r\nHis contention is that the picture was painted as a memorial of the\r\nTreaty of Nuremberg between the Catholics and Protestants in 1532, and\r\nthat the two persons represented are the brothers Otto Henry and Philipp\r\nof Neuburg, Counts Palatine of the Rhine. This theory he still further\r\nelaborated in a book published in 1903 under the title of _Holbein’s\r\nAmbassadors Unriddled_. His arguments, however, are singularly\r\nunconvincing, and have failed to obtain the support of any serious\r\nstudent of Holbein. Before dealing with them, however, it will be better\r\nto give a brief account of the discoveries of Miss Mary F. S. Hervey, by\r\nmeans of which the identity of Holbein’s two sitters was finally set at\r\nrest. Her account of her discovery of a document which provided\r\nconclusive evidence that the two Ambassadors were Jean de Dinteville and\r\nGeorge de Selve was communicated to the _Times_,[79] and this, together\r\nwith further corroborative evidence, was embodied in a book, _Holbein’s\r\nAmbassadors: the Picture and the Men_, published in 1900.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  _The Times_, December 7, 1895.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Miss Hervey happened to come across a copy of the _Revue de\r\nChampagne et de Brie_ for 1888, which gave a short notice of a picture\r\nformerly preserved at Polisy, containing the portraits of Jean de\r\nDinteville and George de Selve. This paragraph was based on a catalogue\r\npublished in March 1888 by M. Saffroy, an antiquarian bookseller of\r\nPré-Saint-Gervais, in which a seventeenth-century parchment, describing\r\nthe picture, was offered for sale. Miss Hervey hastened to communicate\r\nwith M. Saffroy, and by one of those happy chances which seldom occur,\r\nthe document was still in his possession, and proved to contain exactly\r\nthe information which had so long been sought in vain. The following is\r\na translation of its complete text as given by Miss Hervey:—\r\n\r\n“[Remarks on the subject of an excellent picture of the Sieurs\r\nd’Inteville Polizy, and George de Selve Bishop of Lavour, showing the\r\noffices they held, and the time of their decease.]\r\n\r\n“In this picture is represented, life-size, Messire Jean de DIntevile\r\nchevalier Sieur de Polizy, near Bar-sur-Seyne, Bailly of Troyes, who was\r\nAmbassador in England for King Francis I in the years 1532 [O.S.] and\r\n1533 and since Gouverneur of Monsieur Charles de France, second son\r\n(_sic_) of the said King; the said Charles died at Forest Monstier in\r\nthe year 1545, and the said Sr. de DIntvile in the year 1555. Interred\r\nin the Church of the said Polizy. There is also represented in the said\r\npicture Messire George de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur, a personage of great\r\nlearning and virtue, who was Ambassador with the Emperor Charles V; the\r\nsaid Bishop was the son of Messire Jean de Selve, Premier President of\r\nthe Parliament of Paris; the said Bishop died in 1541, having in the\r\nabove-mentioned year 1532, or 1533, gone to England by permission of the\r\nKing, to visit the said Sieur de DIntevile, his intimate friend, and\r\nalso of all his family; and they two having met in England an excellent\r\nDutch painter, employed him to make this picture, which has been\r\ncarefully preserved at the same place, Polizy, up to the year 1653.”\r\n\r\nThe manuscript consists of an oblong piece of parchment which may have\r\nbeen cut from an inventory, but it is more probable that it was written\r\nas a descriptive label to be attached to the picture-frame, after the\r\npicture’s removal from Polisy in 1653. The latter supposition would\r\naccount for the fact that no mention is made of the place where the\r\npicture then was, which would, of course, be unnecessary. The\r\nauthenticity of this document has been pronounced by the British Museum\r\nauthorities to be indisputable. The body of it was written just after\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century, while the heading was added at a\r\nslightly later date, at a time, no doubt, when the label had become\r\nseparated from the picture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PICTURE AT POLISY]\r\n\r\nIn her book Miss Hervey gives a long and interesting account of the\r\nlives of the two men. It is sufficient to state here that Jean de\r\nDinteville was born in September 1504, and was therefore in his\r\ntwenty-ninth year when he came to England as resident French ambassador\r\nin February 1533; and that the name “Polisy” is given a prominent place\r\non the terrestrial globe placed near him in the picture. The second\r\nsitter, George de Selve, was appointed to the see of Lavaur in 1526,\r\nwhen he was in his eighteenth year, but was only consecrated in 1534,\r\nwhen he was in his twenty-sixth year, which exactly agrees with the\r\ninscription on the picture, which states that he was then in his\r\ntwenty-fifth year.[80] Further evidence exists in the shape of a grant\r\nfrom the Pope to De Selve, dated May 1526, permitting him to hold\r\nseveral benefices “although only seventeen years old.” The fact that he\r\nwas not consecrated until the year after the picture was painted,\r\nalthough appointed to the see of Lavaur in 1526, explains why Holbein\r\nhas not represented him in episcopal robes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  See _Gallia Christiana_ (Lutetiæ, 1715), vol. xiii. (1722), p. 344.\r\n  _Ecclesia Vaurensis_, No. xxi., Georgius de Selve. (Quoted by Miss\r\n  Hervey, p. 13.)\r\n\r\nThis document is confirmed by a further discovery by Miss Hervey of a\r\n_Mémoire_ preserved in the Bibliothèque de l’Institut at Paris, which\r\ngives a summary of three letters concerning the picture. The letters\r\nthemselves, which so far, with possibly one exception, have not yet been\r\ndiscovered, were addressed by Nicolas Camusat, the antiquary, canon of\r\nTroyes, and an intimate friend of the Dinteville family for many years,\r\nto his friends the Godefroy brothers, to whom and to others he\r\nconstantly supplied antiquarian and genealogical information. His\r\nletters relating to Polisy extended from 1607 to 1655.\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of the memorandum:\r\n\r\n    “Memoir in explanation of three letters sent by Monsr. Camusat,\r\n    Canon of St. Pierre at Troyes, [touching a picture made in\r\n    England of George de Selve, Bp. of Lavaur, who had gone thither\r\n    to visit the Bailly of Troies, Sr. de Polizi, Jean d’Inteville,\r\n    at that time the King’s ambassador].\r\n\r\n    “There are two relating to the Bishop of Lavaur, George de\r\n    Selve, son of Mr. le Premier President de Selve, which Bishop\r\n    had been invited by Mr. de Polizy, bailly of Troyes, ambassador\r\n    in England in the years 1532 [O.S.] and 1533, to visit him in\r\n    England, which he did, having first taken leave of the King. And\r\n    being in England, they had made the excellent picture by a Dutch\r\n    painter, Holben, which picture was preserved in the House of\r\n    Polizy, distant but one league from Bar-sur-Seine, a hundred and\r\n    forty [_sic_] years and more, as belonging to the Seigneur of\r\n    the place, Sr. de Sessac, until the year 1653, when he had it\r\n    removed to Paris, to his house near the parish of St. Sulpice;\r\n    the said picture representing the said Sr. de Polizy, Jean de\r\n    d’Inteville, and the said Sr. Bishop of Lavaur, who was\r\n    afterwards ambassador with Charles V; and the said Bishop died\r\n    in 1541. The said picture is considered the finest piece of\r\n    painting in France in the opinion of the best painters. M. le\r\n    Mareschal du Plessis-Praslain not long since bought the estate\r\n    of Polisy for three hundred thousand livres from the said Sr. de\r\n    Sessac.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. de Vic, garde des sceaux, formerly said that it was the\r\n    most beautiful piece of painting in France.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. George de Selve, and his brothers, worthily served France\r\n    in various embassies and legations.”\r\n\r\nIn this document the name of the painter, “Holben,” is given; it is\r\ninserted between the lines, but is in the same hand and of the same date\r\nas the writing which surrounds it. The portion at the head of the\r\nmemorandum between brackets is by another hand. It is interesting to\r\nnote that not only is the name of the painter given but that in the\r\nseventeenth century Holbein’s work was considered, both by painters and\r\namateurs, to be the finest picture then in France. There is in the\r\nGodefroy collection a second paper, a copy, dated 1654, of a memorandum\r\ndrawn up by Camusat, in which there is further reference to the picture.\r\nIt need not be quoted here, but it speaks of the figures as life-size,\r\nand concludes by saying that “the piece is esteemed the richest and best\r\nwrought that is to be found in France.”[81]\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  See Miss Hervey, _Holbein’s Ambassadors_, p. 18 _et seq._, where both\r\n  documents are reproduced in facsimile.\r\n\r\nThus the identity of Holbein’s sitters is irrefutably established, and\r\nthe picture’s history can now be traced almost without a break.\r\nDinteville, who had already been in England on a short mission in 1531,\r\nreached London at the beginning of February 1533, and was lodged in the\r\nroyal palace of Bridewell, by the Thames. The exact date of George de\r\nSelve’s visit to him is not known, but it was between February and\r\nEaster in that year; he was back in France before the end of May. There\r\nappears to have been some secrecy in connection with the latter’s\r\njourney to England, for though he had the permission of Francis I, for\r\nsome reason Montmorency, the Grand Master, was, if possible, to be kept\r\nin ignorance of it. In a letter, dated 23rd May, to his brother, the\r\nBishop of Auxerre, Dinteville says: “Monsr. de Lavor m’a fait cest\r\nhonneur que de me venir veoir, qui ne m’a esté petit plaisir. Il n’est\r\npoint de besoing que Mr. le grant maistre en entende rien.”[82]\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  From a letter in the Dupuy Collection, Paris, Bibl. Nat., vol. 726, f.\r\n  46, quoted by Miss Hervey, p. 80.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JEAN DE DINTEVILLE AND HOLBEIN]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say in what way Dinteville became acquainted with\r\nHolbein, or to whose offices the introduction between ambassador and\r\npainter was due. Dinteville counted among his friends more than one of\r\nHolbein’s sitters, while he was, no doubt, well acquainted with Niklaus\r\nKratzer through his keen interest in mechanics and the various\r\nastronomical and mathematical sciences. He had thus more than one\r\nopportunity of seeing examples of Holbein’s skill in portraiture, and it\r\nis to be gathered that he conceived a great admiration for it, for\r\notherwise he would not have ordered so large and important a portrait\r\ngroup of himself and his friend. With the exception of the “Duchess of\r\nMilan,” the More family group, and the now lost “Fitzwilliam, Earl of\r\nSouthampton,” of which there is a good copy in the Fitzwilliam Museum,\r\nCambridge, the “Ambassadors” is the only portrait-panel painted by\r\nHolbein in England of which there is any record in which the figures are\r\nshown both life-size and at full-length. As there is no reference in the\r\nState papers of England or France to the semi-secret business which\r\nbrought George de Selve over to London, the suggestion may be hazarded\r\nthat he came for the express purpose of having his portrait painted,\r\nDinteville urging him to do so on account of the excellent painter he\r\nhad discovered. The picture, crowded as it is with intricate\r\naccessories, must have taken a considerable time to complete. It was, no\r\ndoubt, painted in the Ambassador’s own room in Bridewell Palace, and the\r\nsitter and the painter must have spent long hours in planning out and\r\narranging the many mathematical and scientific instruments which form so\r\nimportant a feature of the panel, some of which may have been lent by or\r\npurchased from Kratzer. The visit of the future Bishop of Lavaur was so\r\nshort that he can hardly have seen more than the beginning of the work\r\nand the finishing of his own head and hands. No doubt Holbein followed\r\nhis usual practice and made preliminary studies of the two heads, but\r\nthese drawings have not been traced, although there is a very fine\r\nunnamed study in the Windsor collection (Pl. 36 (1))[83] which is\r\nsupposed to represent Jean de Dinteville, the features showing\r\nsufficient resemblance to those of the Bailly of Troyes to induce the\r\nsuggestion that it represents him at a later date. Both Sir Sidney\r\nColvin and Miss Hervey hold this opinion, as did the late Sir Frederick\r\nBurton; but it must be confessed that the resemblance is not very\r\nstriking.[84] The Windsor drawing is of a man considerably older than\r\nthe Dinteville of the picture; but the Bailly, after his residence in\r\nthis country throughout the greater part of 1533, paid only three short\r\nvisits to London between the years 1535 and 1537. Even if the drawing\r\nhad been made by Holbein in the last-named year he would only have been\r\nin his thirty-third year. A miniature or portrait, painted by Holbein\r\nfrom this drawing, was in the Arundel Collection, and was engraved by\r\nHollar. It is highly improbable, too, that after he had been so\r\nelaborately painted Dinteville would have sat again for his portrait a\r\nfew years later, so that, all things considered, this attribution can\r\nonly be accepted with caution. There is, however, an undoubted portrait\r\nof Dinteville at Chantilly, forming part of the collection of drawings\r\nof the ladies and gentlemen of the Court of Francis I, by Jean Clouet\r\nand his school, which was formerly at Castle Howard. This portrait was\r\nidentified by Miss Hervey in 1904.[85] The likeness is very marked,\r\nthough the drawing lacks the strength and fine draughtsmanship to be\r\nfound in similar portrait-studies by Holbein, and it appears to have\r\nbeen done within a few years of the picture itself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 345; Wornum, i. 12; Holmes, i. 52; engraved by Hollar, 1649\r\n  (Parthey, 1547).

(July 1904), where the drawing\r\n  is reproduced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “THE COURT OF FRANCIS II”]\r\n\r\nThe picture was taken back to France by Dinteville, and remained at\r\nPolisy until the middle of the seventeenth century. By the marriage, in\r\n1562, of Dinteville’s niece, Claude, with François de Cazillac, Baron de\r\nCessac, the family estates, and with them the picture, passed into the\r\npossession of the latter house, a distinguished family in the south of\r\nFrance. In 1654 a later François de Cazillac sold Polisy, and\r\npermanently removed to the Château of Milhars in Languedoc, his chief\r\nresidence. From the second document quoted above we learn that De Cessac\r\nremoved the picture to his town house in Paris in 1653. This house was\r\nin the Rue du Four, St. Germain des Prez, behind the house known as\r\nChapeaufort, in the parish of St. Sulpice.[86] From 1653 onwards there\r\nis no actual evidence as to the whereabouts of the picture until it\r\nturned up one hundred and twenty years later in the Beaujon sale in\r\nParis in 1787. During his researches into its past history Mr. W. F.\r\nDickes discovered this sale-catalogue in the Cabinet des Estampes in\r\nParis.[87] Nicolas Beaujon, a rich financier and collector of pictures\r\nand objects of art, died without heirs in 1786, leaving all his money to\r\ncharities. His pictures were sold in the following spring, and among\r\nthem were two attributed to Holbein. These two works were not,\r\napparently, part of Beaujon’s collection, but were put into the sale by\r\nsome other person.[88] The first, which, according to the\r\nsale-catalogue, represented the Court of Francis II, has recently come\r\nto light again;[89] the second was the “Ambassadors” picture. The two\r\nwere sold together in one lot for the insignificant sum of 602 francs,\r\nand the purchaser was evidently Le Brun. The description of the picture\r\nin the sale-catalogue tallies almost exactly with Le Brun’s description\r\nwhich accompanied Pierron’s engraving. From the sale-catalogue he\r\nobtained the supposed names of the sitters, “MM. de Selve et d’Avaux,”\r\nand he evidently endorsed, without troubling to make a careful\r\nexamination of his own, the further statement of the catalogue that\r\nthere was no date upon it. Probably the picture was in need of cleaning,\r\nso that both signature and date were obscured. Mr. Wornum discovered\r\nthem in 1865, and they had been noted by others before that date. When\r\nthe picture was acquired for the National Gallery, however, the\r\nsignature had again become obscured by dirt, after the passage of some\r\nthirty years, and was only deciphered after re-cleaning.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  See Miss Hervey, _Holbein’s Ambassadors_, pt. i. chap. ii. p. 21.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  Dickes, p. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  See below, p. 46.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  This picture, which is the subject of a very interesting article by\r\n  Miss Mary F. S. Hervey and Mr. R. Martin-Holland in the _Burlington\r\n  Magazine_ for April 1911 (vol. xviii. No. xcvii. pp. 48-55), where it\r\n  is reproduced, together with other works of its author, a forgotten\r\n  French painter named Félix Chrétien, was described in the Beaujon\r\n  catalogue as “The Court of Francis II and the principal nobles of that\r\n  time, with the attributes of Moses and Aaron, who present themselves\r\n  before the King of Egypt, who is Francis II himself; their names are\r\n  written on the different contours of their robes,” &c. It further\r\n  stated that it was “by the famous Holbein, towards 1552.” From the\r\n  time of the Beaujon sale in 1787 all traces of this large panel\r\n  painting—5 ft. 9 in. high by 6 ft. 2 in. wide—were lost, until it\r\n  suddenly reappeared in Messrs. Christie’s saleroom on February 26,\r\n  1910, in company with the big group of Sir Thomas More and Family. In\r\n  the catalogue it was given to Holbein, and was described as “Moses and\r\n  Aaron before Pharaoh” (“a group of figures, said to represent King\r\n  Henry VIII as Pharaoh,” &c.), and as formerly in the collection of the\r\n  Prince de Cerny. The mystery of the picture’s meaning was cleared up,\r\n  and the name of its painter discovered, by Miss Hervey and Mr.\r\n  Martin-Holland, and will be found in their paper. It contains\r\n  portraits of a number of the members of the Dinteville family,\r\n  including the Bailly of Troyes, who appears as Moses, and his brother,\r\n  François II, Bishop of Auxerre, as Aaron. The Pharaoh is evidently\r\n  Francis I, though the likeness is by no means a good one. The names of\r\n  most of the figures are given on the hems of their robes. The picture\r\n  affords valuable additional proof of the identity of the personage on\r\n  the spectator’s left in the “Ambassadors” with Jean de Dinteville, for\r\n  the likeness is striking. The picture was painted in 1537, and\r\n  remained in the possession of the Dinteville family, together with the\r\n  greater work by Holbein, for exactly two hundred and fifty years. The\r\n  identity of the picture with the one in the Beaujon sale was first\r\n  pointed out by Mr. P. G. Konody (_Burlington Magazine_, vol. xix. No.\r\n  xcviii., May 1911, p. 106). Félix Chrétien, the painter of it, was a\r\n  chorister, and afterwards a canon of Auxerre, of which town he was\r\n  probably a native. He was a protégé of the Bishop’s, and no doubt owed\r\n  his training in art to him. Several of his pictures, considerably\r\n  damaged, remain in the immediate district of Auxerre.\r\n\r\nAlthough no actual proofs can be produced as to the whereabouts of the\r\npicture between 1653 and 1787, Miss Hervey, in the course of her\r\nresearches into the history of the De Cessac family, discovered\r\nsufficient evidence to point to the probability that M. de Cessac took\r\nit with him to Milhars when he finally settled there a few years later,\r\nand that it remained there until shortly before the Beaujon sale. The\r\nMilhars estate descended from heir to heir of the house of Dinteville\r\nuntil 1765, when it was sold by the Marquis de Basville, who then\r\nrepresented the family. He was the intimate friend of Beaujon, who made\r\nhim his executor, in which capacity he drew up the inventory of all the\r\nbanker’s pictures and art objects. In this inventory, however, there is\r\nno trace of Holbein’s “Ambassadors” to be found, and the inference is\r\nthat as it was included in the Beaujon sale three months later it was\r\nput into that sale by the executor himself. It seems certain, therefore,\r\nthat from the time when the picture was taken from England by Dinteville\r\nin 1533 until it was sent back again by Le Brun more than two hundred\r\nand fifty years later it never once left France, but remained as a\r\ntreasured possession in the family for whose ancestor it was\r\npainted.[90]\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  See Miss Hervey, pt. i. chap. ii.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE THEORIES OF MR. DICKES]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the conclusive proof brought forward by Miss Hervey, Mr. W.\r\nF. Dickes, in his book devoted to the unriddling of the “Ambassadors,”\r\nrefused to abandon his theory of the Nuremberg Treaty, and still pinned\r\nhis faith to his Princes Palatine Otto Henry and Philipp. It is\r\nessential to his theory that Holbein should be proved to have been\r\nabsent from England in 1533, and he, therefore, gives it as his opinion\r\nthat the Steelyard portraits of that year, and the Cheseman\r\nportrait,[91] were most probably painted abroad. He cites, as actual\r\nproof that Holbein was in Basel in 1533, in addition to the extract from\r\nthe “Banner Book” referred to in the preceding chapter,[92] the “Wheel\r\nof Fortune” picture in distemper at Chatsworth, which is dated 1533,\r\nwith the arms of Basel on the post supporting the wheel. “No one can\r\ndoubt,” he says, “that it was painted by Holbein at Basel in 1533;”[93]\r\nbut, as a matter of fact, it is not by Holbein at all, being far too\r\npoor a work to be from his hand, but by Hans Schaeufelin, and the\r\ninitials “H. H.” on it are of later date. The monogram and the\r\nwell-known mark, in the form of a shovel, of the latter painter, which\r\nhave been tampered with, are still clearly discernible beneath the\r\nletters.[94]\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 54-56.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  Page 32. See also pp. 157-178.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  Dickes, p. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  As pointed out by Mr. S. Arthur Strong in his preface to _The\r\n  Masterpieces of the Duke of Devonshire’s Collection of Pictures_,\r\n  1901, and republished in _Critical Studies and Fragments_, 1905, p.\r\n  92, and Pl. viii. 1.\r\n\r\nIn his book Mr. Dickes abandons, or at least does not reprint, some of\r\nthe more fantastic theories he advanced in his magazine articles; but in\r\nall that he has published on the subject his method of procedure is the\r\nsimple one of denying the authenticity of all evidence which is\r\ndestructive of his theory. Thus, he does not hesitate to declare the\r\nfirst document discovered by Miss Hervey to be an eighteenth-century\r\nforgery, and the two confirmatory papers amongst the Godefroy\r\ncorrespondence he places in the same category. With regard to the date\r\nand Holbein’s signature, he accepts as a fact the “staggering statement”\r\nof the Beaujon sale-catalogue that in 1787 the picture was unsigned and\r\nundated; and he infers that the inscription was added by Le Brun, and\r\nthat the three documents discovered by Miss Hervey were all forgeries\r\ndue to the same unscrupulous dealer. Why such an elaborate falsification\r\nshould be thought necessary, and what purpose it served, unless merely\r\nto display the genealogical learning of the forger, Mr. Dickes fails to\r\nexplain. When Le Brun issued his engraving in 1792, with a descriptive\r\nnote lifted bodily from the Beaujon catalogue, and retaining the same\r\ntitle, “MM. de Selve et d’Avaux,” he had already sold the picture into\r\nEngland, so that to elaborate a series of forgeries in connection with\r\nit, and then scatter them about France and get them inserted among the\r\npapers of learned antiquaries, after the picture had left the country,\r\nwould seem to be a very futile proceeding; and if he had added the date\r\n1533 and a false signature to it before selling it he would surely have\r\nrefrained from stating in his printed description of it that it was\r\npainted in “la manière dont il a marqué ses ouvrages HB. BH. 1515.” The\r\nwhole theory, in fact, is absurd, as is Mr. Dickes’ further declaration\r\nthat the name “Policy” on the globe is also a forgery due to Le Brun.\r\nThe inscription on the book giving the age of George de Selve, “ætatis\r\nsuæ 25,” is also a forgery according to the same authority, or rather,\r\nhe holds that the last figure was originally an 8, but that it became\r\ndamaged, and that when repaired it was altered to a 5 through the\r\nignorance of the restorer. The alteration of the age from 25 to 28, it\r\nshould be noted, is vital to Mr. Dickes’ argument, for otherwise the\r\nsecond figure cannot represent Count Philipp. Even this change, however,\r\nis not sufficient to put matters right, and so he assumes arbitrarily\r\nthat although the picture was painted in 1533 (in spite of its forged\r\ndate!) the ages of the sitters inscribed on the dagger and the book were\r\npurposely calculated from the previous year, in order to indicate that\r\nthe painting was a memorial of the Nuremberg Treaty of 1532. Mr. Dickes\r\nprofesses to find further proofs of the ages of the sitters from the\r\nnumerous accessories on the table. The cylindrical sundial is so\r\narranged that it informs us that the sitter against whom it is placed\r\nwas born on April 10th, about 10.30 P. M., in the latitude of Neuburg,\r\nwhich exactly agrees with the birth of Otto Henry, and this information\r\nis confirmed by the decagonal sundial further along the table. With\r\nrespect to the second figure, the instruments are still more explicit,\r\nfor the date, November 12th, is repeated no less than four times on\r\nApian’s Torquetum, the astrolabe, and the quadrant, with the additional\r\ninformation that the hour of birth was between five and six, which\r\nexactly agrees with the day of the month and the hour of the birth of\r\nPhilipp.[95]\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  The present writer, although he has made a careful study of Mr.\r\n  Dickes’ readings of the instruments, has not sufficient scientific\r\n  knowledge to speak with authority as to the correctness or otherwise\r\n  of the results he obtains, which, if true, provide by far the most\r\n  ingenious and, indeed, the only plausible evidence he has brought\r\n  forward in favour of his theory. This evidence, however, is not always\r\n  as convincing as he would have us to believe. Thus, the decagonal\r\n  sundial, which on two of its sides gives the time as 10.30 (the hour\r\n  of Otto Henry’s birth), very clearly indicates 9.30 on its third and\r\n  most prominent side, while it almost touches the elbow of the second\r\n  figure, and so should refer, if to any one, to Philipp. Mr. Dickes\r\n  gets over this difficulty by the statement that the sundial,\r\n  “presenting three circles to be read, naturally devotes the two chief\r\n  dials to the principal person. These are—the dial with the wire stile,\r\n  in front, and the dial beneath the magnet on the top;” but he offers\r\n  no suggestion as to whose birth the third and most prominent dial\r\n  refers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ACCESSORIES OF THE PICTURE]\r\n\r\nSpace does not permit even a brief reference to further erroneous\r\ninferences which Mr. Dickes draws from other parts of the picture, all\r\nof which were fully and finally dealt with by Sir Sidney Colvin in a\r\nreview of the book.[96] Mr. Dickes by no means strengthens his case by\r\nreproducing a number of portraits, selected from various European\r\ngalleries, in which he sees likenesses to his two heroes, though they\r\nbear but the faintest resemblance either to genuine portraits of the\r\nCounts Palatine or to the sitters in the “Ambassadors” picture.[97]\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, August 1903, pp. 367-69.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  The two most glaring examples of this, which show to what lengths a\r\n  fixed idea can carry one, are the splendid portrait by Holbein of the\r\n  Sieur de Morette, which he declares to be painted by Amberger, and to\r\n  represent Otto Henry at some date after 1556, when he was Elector\r\n  Palatine; and the beautiful little portrait of Hermann Wedigh, of the\r\n  Steelyard, dated 1533, which, as already noted, he holds to be an\r\n  unmistakable portrait of Philipp.\r\n\r\nThe book, in spite of the false theory on which it is based, displays\r\nmuch careful if misplaced research, and as, for this reason, it is apt\r\nto mislead those who have made no serious study of Holbein’s work, its\r\narguments have been briefly dealt with here. Mr. Dickes, however, is not\r\nalone in refusing to accept Jean de Dinteville and George de Selve as\r\nthe two ambassadors. Mrs. G. Fortescue, in her book on the painter,[98]\r\nholds that both Miss Hervey and Mr. Dickes are wrong; but she brings\r\nforward no names to take the place of those she condemns, and merely\r\nsuggests, somewhat mysteriously, that later on she will produce facts\r\nwhich will provide the correct solution.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  _Holbein_ (“Little Books on Art”), 1904, p. 149.\r\n\r\nTurning again to the picture itself, it is evident that the accessories,\r\nwith which the table is crowded, both from their unusual number and\r\ncharacter, were not collected at haphazard merely to afford an\r\nopportunity for displaying Holbein’s skill in depicting minutiæ, but\r\nthat they represent the tastes and learned pursuits of the two sitters,\r\nand were selected and arranged by Dinteville himself. The prevailing\r\nlove of allegory and symbolism, of the emblem or “devise,” which was a\r\nmarked characteristic of that age, is apparent in many of the picture’s\r\ndetails, in some of them to be read plainly, in others so obscurely that\r\nit is now impossible to explain them satisfactorily. Miss Hervey has\r\ndescribed them with care, and has elucidated much of their meaning and\r\npurpose. The appearance of the Death’s-head twice over in the picture—in\r\nthe hat-medal worn by Dinteville and in the distorted skull in the\r\nforeground—seems to indicate that the ambassador had adopted it as his\r\npersonal badge or _devise_. The picture, indeed, in its general\r\narrangement bears considerable likeness to the woodcut in the “Dance of\r\nDeath” series known as “The Arms of Death” (“Die Wappen des Todes”), as\r\nwas first pointed out by Mr. Wornum.[99] This suggests the possibility\r\nthat Dinteville had been shown, perhaps by Holbein himself, a proof set\r\nof the “Dance of Death” woodcuts, and that he had been greatly impressed\r\nby them. He suffered much from ill-health while in England, which may\r\nhave had something to do with his choice of a device of so gloomy a\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 181.\r\n\r\nCertain of the instruments depicted are apparently set to indicate\r\nvarious dates, such as the birthdays of the sitters or important events\r\nin their lives, as pointed out by Mr. Dickes. The same instruments,\r\ntogether with the other objects, also represent certain of the Seven\r\nLiberal Arts—Music, Arithmetic, Geometry and Astronomy. The terrestrial\r\nglobe is copied from Johann Schöner’s globe of 1523, to which about\r\ntwenty names of towns have been added by Holbein, chiefly in France and\r\nSpain, selected by Dinteville as an epitome of the foreign relations of\r\nFrance in shaping which he had taken some share, the most important of\r\nthese additions, as elucidating the identity of the chief sitter, being,\r\nof course, Polisy. The Lutheran hymn-book and the crucifix may be taken\r\nas symbolical of France’s religious diplomacy and the opinions of the\r\ntwo friends. The hope of religious union between the Roman Catholic and\r\nthe Reformed Churches played a large part in the life of the Bishop of\r\nLavaur. “To find means to promote that end was the object of his most\r\nearnest thought; to see it accomplished, the dearest wish of his\r\nheart.”[100] Dinteville, too, belonged to the liberal Catholic party in\r\nFrance, and shared the Bishop’s views. Mr. Barclay Squire first pointed\r\nout that the hymn-book in the picture was painted from a copy of Johann\r\nWalther’s _Geystliche Gesangbüchlein_, published at Wittemberg in 1524.\r\nThe German arithmetic book was copied from a manual, _The Merchant’s\r\nArithmetic Book_, by Peter Apian, published at Ingoldstadt in 1527. The\r\nbadge of the order of St. Michael is worn by Dinteville without the\r\ncollar of scallop-shells, and merely suspended from his neck by a gold\r\nchain. This was in accordance with the rules of the Order, which\r\npermitted it to be so worn when under arms, or when travelling, hunting,\r\nor when at home in private, or in other places where there was no\r\ncompany. Other details of the picture are equally interesting, more\r\nparticularly the elaborate mosaic pavement, which Miss Hervey discovered\r\nto be an accurate copy of the well-known paved floor in the Sanctuary of\r\nWestminster Abbey, for the construction of which marbles and workmen\r\nwere brought from Italy by Abbot Richard Ware in the reign of Henry III.\r\nThis interesting discovery affords additional proof that the\r\n“Ambassadors” was painted in England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  Miss Hervey, p. 221.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ACCESSORIES OF THE PICTURE]\r\n\r\nThe picture, which in point of size and in the elaboration of its many\r\ndetails is the most important work by Holbein remaining in England, is a\r\nbrilliant example of the painter’s technical abilities, though as a\r\ncomposition it is less successful than certain other less ambitious\r\nportraits from his brush. The accessories, on account of their number,\r\nvariety, and brilliance of execution, and the central position given to\r\nthem—so that the two figures have something of the appearance of the\r\nsupporters to a coat of arms, as in some of Holbein’s designs for\r\nglass—to some extent distract the attention from the ambassadors\r\nthemselves. Dinteville appears to have selected them with great care,\r\nand evidently attached great importance to them and the meanings they\r\nwere intended to convey; while the painter carried out his wishes so\r\nadmirably that they remain to-day almost as important a part of the\r\npicture as they did in the opinion of the man for whom the work was\r\npainted. The distorted skull, in particular, which at once catches the\r\neye, however entertaining or clever a rebus or emblematic puzzle the\r\nBailly may have thought it, holds far too prominent a position in the\r\ncomposition for the painting to be regarded as a picture in the highest\r\nsense of the word. It is, nevertheless, a work possessing very great\r\nqualities, and, in many respects, must be placed in the forefront of\r\nHolbein’s achievement. The faces of the two men are finely and\r\ndelicately modelled, though their character is not quite so subtly\r\nexpressed as in such a portrait as that of the “Duchess of Milan.” The\r\ndark, penetrating eyes and well-chiselled mouth of Dinteville give\r\nvitality to his intellectual face, in which can be traced some\r\nindications of the delicate constitution which was so ill suited to the\r\nclimate of England. De Selve is grave in contrast, with dark eyebrows\r\nand a more pallid complexion, and his countenance has less expression\r\nand vitality than is to be found in that of his companion. It has been\r\nsuggested that this contrast between the two figures is so great that it\r\nindicates the fact proved by Dinteville’s letter, that the future\r\nBishop’s stay in this country was of limited duration, and that his\r\nportrait was probably not completed from life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 10\r\n  PORTRAIT OF A MUSICIAN\r\n  SIR JOHN RAMSDEN, BULSTRODE PARK\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “PORTRAIT OF A MUSICIAN”]\r\n\r\nIn concluding this account of Dinteville’s connection with Holbein\r\nreference must be made to a portrait in the possession of Sir John\r\nRamsden, Bt., of Bulstrode Park, Buckingham, recently published and\r\ndescribed for the first time by Dr. Ganz in the _Burlington\r\nMagazine_,[101] which represents a man with a book of music and a lute\r\n(Pl. 10). This “Portrait of a Musician” he regards as an undoubted\r\nlikeness of the Bailly of Troyes from Holbein’s brush. He describes it\r\nas follows: “The man is sitting behind a table, and holds in his right\r\nhand a roll of paper, in the left a guitar. Two books in red bindings\r\nwith green ribbons are placed, one open, one closed, on the red\r\ntablecloth, and this group of colours forms the contrast to the green\r\ncurtain of the background. The cap and the black coat with large facings\r\nand white shirt-ruffles hanging down are decorated with golden buttags\r\nof a longish form, after the French fashion of the time. The blue eyes,\r\nlooking with a sharp and cold glance, give the impression of a man of\r\ngreat reflection and prudence; and the beautiful, carefully tended hands\r\nbelong to a gentleman of the Court.... Round the neck he wears a small\r\ngolden chain and a black silk ribbon, to which is attached an object of\r\na very singular form, executed in gold and embellished with precious\r\nstones. This cannot be a simple jewel, intended merely to hang on the\r\ngold chain, but it seems to be a kind of whistle used in place of a\r\ntuning-fork.”[102] This portrait is said to represent Lord Vaux of\r\nHarrowden, from its supposed resemblance to the two drawings by Holbein\r\nof that personage at Windsor, but Dr. Ganz holds that it bears a much\r\ncloser resemblance to Dinteville as he is shown in the “Ambassadors,”\r\nand still more so to the drawing found by Miss Hervey at Chantilly. He\r\nconsiders that the longer beard indicates that it was painted two years\r\nlater than the National Gallery picture. “The technical execution,” he\r\nsays, “confirms a later date of origin; the blending of the colours and\r\nthe brilliancy are in the well-preserved parts like the finest enamel.\r\nThe right hand, which has a smooth appearance, is retouched; but the\r\nextraordinary quality of Holbein’s art in modelling the flesh without\r\nany contrast is to be found in the face and in the execution of the left\r\nhand. His attention was not limited to creating a portrait with the\r\nexactness of a looking-glass; he tried to give the man in his intimacy\r\nby obtaining a spacious effect. He placed the figure between two objects\r\nand painted the shadows in their real values.” While admitting that the\r\nlikeness between this Musician and Dinteville is a strong one, the\r\npresent writer is of opinion that the picture at Bulstrode Park does not\r\nrepresent the French ambassador. As already pointed out,[103]\r\nDinteville’s subsequent visits to England were all short ones, of only a\r\nfew weeks’ duration, during which time there would be little opportunity\r\nfor sitting for his portrait, nor is it very probable that he would want\r\na second likeness of himself so shortly after the big work was finished.\r\nLittle is known of the history of Sir John Ramsden’s picture, but it is\r\nprobably the _ritratto d’un Musico_ of the Arundel inventory. It is said\r\nto have been purchased in 1860 from a sale in Scotland. Either this\r\npicture, or a replica of it, was in the Ralph Bernal sale, 1855, when it\r\nwas sold to Mr. Morant for one hundred guineas. It was described in the\r\nsale catalogue as: “Portrait of Nicholas, Lord Vaux, the poet and\r\nmusician, in a black dress and cap, seated at a table, an open book\r\nbefore him, he holds a viol de gambe in his left hand, green drapery\r\nbehind, 17½ × 17, a most beautiful portrait of the highest interest.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  Vol. xx., October 1911, pp. 31-2.

Churchill in _Burlington Magazine_, vol.\r\n  xx., January 1912, p. 239, who calls attention to a similar penknife\r\n  in the Figdor Collection, and to an engraving by Aldegrever of a like\r\n  object dated 1539.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  See above, p. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n                         PORTRAITS OF 1533-1536\r\n\r\nPortraits of Robert Cheseman—Thomas Cromwell—Lord Abergavenny—Charles de\r\n  Solier, Sieur de Morette—The Earl of Arundel’s collection of\r\n  pictures—Roundels of a man and his wife at Vienna—Portraits of members\r\n  of the Poyntz family—Nicolas Bourbon—His verses in praise of\r\n  Holbein—Design for the title-page of Coverdale’s Bible—Other woodcut\r\n  designs produced in England—Hall’s Chronicle—Portraits of Sir Thomas\r\n  Wyat—Margaret Wyat, Lady Lee—Sir Richard Southwell—Sir Thomas le\r\n  Strange—Lady Vaux—Sir Nicholas Carew.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is only one portrait by Holbein bearing the date 1533 which can be\r\nsaid with any certainty to represent an Englishman. This is the very\r\nbeautiful one of Robert Cheseman, now in the Hague Gallery, which has\r\nbeen known for so long under the erroneous title of “Henry VIII’s\r\nFalconer” (Pl. 11).[104] It represents a man holding a much higher\r\nsocial position than that of a mere keeper of hawks. Henry’s falconers\r\nwere paid at a rate which did not permit them to employ the services of\r\nthe leading artist of the day should they wish—which is not at all\r\nprobable—to have their portraits painted. Their wages, in fact, ranged\r\nbetween fifty and twenty shillings a month. Cheseman, in common with\r\nother gentlemen of that period, chose to be painted with his favourite\r\nhawk upon his wrist, for the same reason that the country squires of the\r\neighteenth century were so often depicted with their favourite dogs.\r\nAnother example of this habit is to be seen in the equally fine portrait\r\nby Holbein of an unknown man, also in the Hague Gallery, dated 1542, who\r\nis evidently a gentleman, and not a professional falconer.[105]\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 159.

He was born in 1485, son and heir\r\nof Edward Cheseman, Cofferer and Keeper of the Wardrobe to Henry VII,\r\nand succeeded to the family estates in 1517. His father is mentioned in\r\na pardon granted on March 2nd, 1486,[106] “to Edward Cheseman of London,\r\ngentleman, of all fines, forfeitures, etc., due to the King or to\r\nRichard III, late, in deed and not of right, King of England,” which was\r\ngranted him as one of the executors of the will of Thomas Windesore,\r\nConstable of Windsor Castle. There was also a William Cheseman, probably\r\nan uncle of Robert, who in 1485 and 1486 received grants of the offices\r\nof bailiff of the rapes of Lewes and of Braneburgh, and of Clerk of the\r\nMarket of the town of Lewes, “in consideracion of the true and\r\nfeithfulle service that our welbeloved servaunt and true liegeman\r\nWilliam Cheseman hathe doone unto us, as well in the parties of beyonde\r\nthe see, as at oure late victorious felde within this oure\r\nroyaume.”[107]\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  Rev. William Campbell, _Materials for a History of the Reign of Henry\r\n  VII_, Rolls Publications, 1873, p. 336.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, p. 345.\r\n\r\nOn August 30th, 1523, Robert Cheseman was appointed Commissioner for\r\nEssex to collect the subsidy,[108] and in December 1528 was placed upon\r\nthe commission of the peace for Middlesex. In 1530 he represented the\r\nsame county on a commission “to make inquisition in different counties\r\nconcerning the possessions held by Thomas Cardinal Archbishop of York\r\n(Wolsey) on 2 Dec. 15 Hen. VIII, when the Cardinal committed certain\r\noffences against the Crown for which he was attainted.”[109] During his\r\nlife he served on a number of commissions for collecting tithes,\r\nsubsidies, and the like, including one in 1533, the year in which he sat\r\nto Holbein. In 1536 his name appears among a list of people from whom\r\nmoney is due to the King by obligations,[110] while in the same year he\r\nsupplied thirty men for the army against the Northern rebels, which\r\nproves him to have been a man of considerable substance.[111] He served\r\non the Grand Jury at the trials of Sir Geoffrey Pole, Sir Edward\r\nNeville, and others, in 1538,[112] and of Thomas Culpeper and Francis\r\nDereham for treason in connection with the trial of Queen Catherine\r\nHoward in 1541.[113] He was among the “squires” selected to welcome Anne\r\nof Cleves when she first landed in England, and was, in fact, one of\r\nsome half-dozen men of position who represented Middlesex on all such\r\npublic occasions. In 1543 he supplied ten footmen for the army going\r\ninto Flanders “for the defence of the Emperor’s Low Countries,[114] and\r\nin the following year he himself appears to have gone with the English\r\narmy into France, and it is noted against his name in the muster book\r\nthat he had “10 footmen already beyond the seas.” He married Alice,\r\ndaughter of Henry Dacres, of Mayfield, Staffordshire, a merchant-tailor\r\nand alderman of Fleet Street, London. She died on July 31st, 1547, and\r\nwas buried at Norwood. His daughter and heir, Anne Cheseman, married\r\nFrancis Chamberlayne.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iii. pt. ii. 3282.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iv. pt. iii. 6516, 6598.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. x. 1257.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xi. 580.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 986.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xvi. 1395 (p. 645).\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xviii. pt. i. 832 (p. 467).\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Cheseman is a half-length, facing the spectator, the\r\nhead and eyes turned to the left. He wears a purplish red silk doublet,\r\nand a black cloak trimmed with fur, and the customary black cap. On his\r\nleft hand, which is gloved, he carries a hooded hawk, with a bell on its\r\nclaw, and with the other hand strokes its feathers. He is clean-shaven,\r\nand his long hair, which is beginning to turn grey, covers his ears.\r\nAcross the plain blue background, which has turned green through the\r\ndiscoloration of the varnish, on either side of the sitter’s head, runs\r\nthe inscription in Roman lettering:\r\n\r\n      “ROBERTVS CHESEMAN. ETATES SVÆ XLVIII · ANNO DM. M D XXXIII.”\r\n\r\nThe painting of the beautiful plumage of the bird is a most masterly\r\npiece of work, and the keen, piercing eyes and clean-cut face of its\r\nmaster are rendered with that unerring truth and wonderful insight which\r\ngive Holbein his foremost place among the supreme painters of portraits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF ROBERT CHESEMAN]\r\n\r\nThis picture was seen by Sir Joshua Reynolds during his tour through\r\nFlanders and Holland in 1781, and in his diary he describes it as:—“A\r\nportrait by Holbein; admirable for its truth and precision and extremely\r\nwell coloured. The blue flat ground which is behind the head gives a\r\ngeneral effect of dryness to the picture: had the ground been varied,\r\nand made to harmonize more with the figure, this portrait might have\r\nstood in competition with the works of the best portrait painters.”[115]\r\nThis accusation of a slight “dryness” is to some extent true of certain,\r\nthough by no means all, of the portraits painted by Holbein in England,\r\nwhen compared with some of his earlier work done in Basel. It has been\r\nsuggested that this may have been due to a growing habit, caused by the\r\nincreasing demands made upon his time, of placing greater reliance on\r\nhis preliminary chalk studies in painting a portrait, and thereby\r\nreducing the number of sittings given him by the actual model.[116]\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  _A Journey to Flanders and Holland in the year 1781._ Works, vol. ii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 251-2.\r\n\r\nAn old copy of this portrait was lent to the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No.\r\n173A), by the Rev. Charles Shepherd. The original picture was once in\r\nthe royal collections of England. It was No. 8 on the list of objects of\r\nart which Queen Anne reclaimed from the Dutch States at the death of\r\nWilliam III as having formed part of the collection belonging to the\r\nEnglish royal house. Her claim was unsuccessful, and the picture\r\nremained in Holland. On the back of the panel are the letters\r\nW.E.H.P.L.C. and the seal of Johan Willem Friso, Prince of\r\nOrange-Nassau, in whose collection it was, and afterwards in that of\r\nWilliam V. The second fine portrait of a man with a hawk in the Hague\r\nGallery,[117] dated 1542, was another of the pictures claimed by Anne,\r\nand was No. 21 in her list. A third picture in the Hague, the beautiful\r\nportrait of a young woman[118] (No. 275), now considered to represent\r\nHolbein’s wife, has been already described. The Cheseman and the 1542\r\nportrait were evidently taken over to Holland, with other paintings, by\r\nWilliam III during one of his visits to the Hague.\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  See p. 203.\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. p. 106.\r\n\r\nA small round portrait on wood, in the collection of Frau L.\r\nGoldschmidt-Przibram in Brussels,[119] is dated 1533. According to both\r\nWoltmann and Zahn it is in a very damaged condition, but is a genuine\r\nwork of Holbein. It represents a young man at half-length, facing the\r\nspectator, but with the head slightly turned to the left. He is\r\nclean-shaven, with bushy hair half hiding his ears, and wears the small\r\nflat black cap and costume of the German merchants of the Steelyard, and\r\nhe was probably a member of that body. The right hand only is shown,\r\nholding a carnation. Across the plain background, on either side of the\r\nhead, is inscribed “ANNO 1533.” The face is a very attractive one, and\r\nthe portrait has for years been regarded as representing the painter\r\nhimself. Dr. Woltmann so included it in his book, but it bears little\r\nresemblance to the genuine portraits of Holbein. It was previously in\r\nthe Jäger, Gsell, and Fräulein Gabriele Przibram collections in Vienna.\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 261. Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 104.

The future Earl of Essex and “viceregent of the King in all\r\nhis ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the realm” was then only at the\r\nbeginning of his political career, and filled the minor post of Master\r\nof the Jewel House. The portrait of him in the possession of the Earl of\r\nCaledon,[120] at Tyttenhanger Park, St. Albans, which is evidently the\r\noriginal of several versions still in existence, although it has\r\nsuffered greatly in the course of time, must be regarded as a genuine\r\nwork of Holbein’s brush. The face has undergone severe repainting, but\r\nin many of the details his hand can be clearly traced. On one of the\r\npapers on the table in front of the sitter is the following address: “To\r\nour trusty and right wellbiloved Counsailler Thomas Cromwell, Maister of\r\no^r Jewelhouse,” which proves that it cannot have been painted later\r\nthan the first months of 1534, for early in that year Cromwell was\r\npromoted to be First Secretary of State and Master of the Rolls. He\r\nmust, therefore, have sat to Holbein at some date between the latter\r\nhalf of 1532 and the spring of 1534, having been appointed to the Jewel\r\nHouse on the 12th April 1532 in place of Robert Amadas, the jeweller. If\r\ndone after his advancement, his higher titles would have been noted in\r\nthe inscription.\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 249.

He also made constant use\r\nof their services later on in his career for the collection of\r\ncontinental news, the forwarding of diets to various English ambassadors\r\nabroad, the translating of foreign letters, and so on.\r\n\r\nEustace Chapuys, the Spanish Ambassador in London, in reply to a query\r\nfrom his Imperial master as to the character of Henry’s new minister,\r\nsent, in November 1535, a short and amusing biographical sketch of his\r\ncareer, interesting as showing how Cromwell appeared in the eyes of a\r\nforeigner.\r\n\r\n“The Secretary, Cromwell,” he wrote, “is the son of a poor farrier, who\r\nlived in a little village a league and a half from here (London), and is\r\nburied in the parish graveyard. His uncle, father of the cousin whom he\r\nhas already made rich, was cook (_cousinier_) of the late archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. Cromwell was ill-behaved when young, and after an\r\nimprisonment was forced to leave the country. He went to Flanders, Rome,\r\nand elsewhere in Italy. When he returned he married the daughter of a\r\nshearman, and served in his house; he then became a solicitor. The\r\ncardinal of York, seeing his vigilance and diligence, his ability and\r\npromptitude, both in evil and good, took him into his service, and\r\nemployed him principally in demolishing five or six good monasteries. At\r\nthe Cardinal’s fall no one behaved better to him than Cromwell. After\r\nthe Cardinal’s death Wallop attacked him with insults and threats, and\r\nfor protection he procured an audience of the King, and promised to make\r\nhim the richest king that ever was in England. The King immediately\r\nretained him on his Council, but told no one for four months. Now he\r\nstands above everyone but the Lady (Anne Boleyn), and everyone considers\r\nhe has more credit with his master than Wolsey had—in whose time there\r\nwere others who shared his credit, as Maistre Conton (Compton), the duke\r\nof Suffolk, and others, but now there is no one else who does anything.\r\nThe Chancellor is only his minister. Cromwell would not accept the\r\noffice hitherto, but it is thought that soon he will allow himself to be\r\npersuaded to take it. He speaks well in his own language, and tolerably\r\nin Latin, French and Italian; is hospitable, liberal both with his\r\nproperty and with gracious words, magnificent in his household and in\r\nbuilding.”[121]\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. ix. 862.\r\n\r\nThis is the man whom Holbein painted when he was merely Master of the\r\nJewel House and Clerk of the Hanaper of Chancery. He is shown, in Lord\r\nCaledon’s picture, at half-length, seated in a high-backed wooden seat,\r\nhis head and body turned to the left, looking towards a window, only a\r\nsmall part of which is seen, with a small table beneath it covered with\r\na Turkish cloth, on which papers are placed. He is dressed in a black\r\nsurcoat with a deep fur collar, and a black cap. He rests his left elbow\r\non another table in front of him, and holds a paper in his left hand, on\r\nthe first finger of which is a heavy signet ring. The right hand is not\r\nshown. He is clean-shaven, and his bushy hair almost covers his ears and\r\nfalls on the back of his neck. On the table are pen and ink, a\r\nrichly-bound book with jewelled clasps, and several papers, on one of\r\nwhich is the inscription already quoted. On a second paper the word\r\n“Counseilor” can be deciphered at the head. The face, with its small\r\neyes set closely together, its thin, compressed lips and double chin,\r\nand its sinister expression of cold determination, is a far from\r\nattractive one, and lays bare that side of Cromwell’s character for\r\nwhich he was so heartily hated by the Catholic party. In it is to be\r\nseen little of that other side of him, of which, after his downfall,\r\nCranmer spoke, when writing to Henry on behalf of his old minister.\r\n“Cromwell,” he said, “was such a servant in my judgment, in wisdom,\r\ndiligence, faithfulness, and experience, as no prince in this realm ever\r\nhad.” A large scroll stretching across the top of the picture, evidently\r\nadded after Cromwell’s death, contains a Latin inscription in his\r\npraise. The portrait is on panel, 30 in. × 24 in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAITS OF THOMAS CROMWELL]\r\n\r\nA smaller portrait of Cromwell, a circular painting with a green\r\nbackground, and enclosed in a painted square stone frame, showing the\r\nhead only, is described by Wornum and Woltmann.[122] It was at that time\r\nin the possession of Captain Ridgway, of Waterloo Place, London.[123] It\r\nis 12 in. square, and differs in some details from the Tyttenhanger\r\nportrait. Both writers appear to regard it as a genuine work by Holbein.\r\nA portrait of Cromwell was one of the few works mentioned by name by Van\r\nMander when describing De Loo’s collection of Holbein’s works:—“the old\r\nLord Crauwl, about a foot and a half high, taken unusually artistically\r\nby Holbein.” Although the dimensions do not quite agree, Woltmann\r\nsuggests that Captain Ridgway’s little picture was the one thus\r\ndescribed. According to Mr. Lionel Cust,[124] the few portraits of\r\nCromwell which have any claim to authenticity are all traceable to\r\nHolbein, and fall into two groups, or at most three, each group deriving\r\nfrom an original portrait by him. In the first class are the\r\nTyttenhanger picture and others based directly upon it. This portrait,\r\nhe says, descends direct from Sir Thomas Pope, one of Cromwell’s\r\ninstruments in the suppression of the monasteries. The second group\r\nincludes such pictures as the one in the National Portrait Gallery (No.\r\n1683, 16¾ in. × 13 in.),[125] purchased in 1897, of which there are\r\nseveral versions in existence, though there is no portrait of this type\r\nso far traced which can be attributed to Holbein himself. The pictures\r\nin this group show the head and shoulders only, and differ in minor\r\ndetails from the Tyttenhanger type. The look of craftiness is\r\naccentuated, and he is shown with a slight grey whisker, and the pointed\r\narch of the eyebrows is more strongly marked. The third group, which is\r\nclosely allied to the second, includes the recently-discovered miniature\r\nin the late Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan’s collection,[126] and the medal in\r\nthe British Museum, of the date 1538, which, according to Mr. Cust, is\r\nevidently based on a drawing by Holbein.[127] There was a portrait of\r\nCromwell in the Arundel collection, which is entered in the inventory as\r\n“ritratto de Cromwell.” This was evidently the one in the possession of\r\nDe Loo, which afterwards passed, with other works by Holbein, from that\r\ndealer’s collection into that of the Earl. Hollar’s engraving,[128]\r\nwhich is not signed or dated, does not appear to have been taken from\r\nthe portrait at Tyttenhanger, but was most probably based upon the\r\nArundel picture; but whether that picture was an original by Holbein,\r\nnow lost, or one of the numerous versions now in existence, it is\r\nimpossible to say. One of these versions is in the collection of M. Ch.\r\nLéon Cardon, Brussels.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 212, and i. 376; Wornum, p. 287.\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  Now, according to Dr. Ganz (_Holbein_, p. 241) in that of M.\r\n  Kleinberger, Paris.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  In an interesting paper on “A newly-discovered miniature of Thomas\r\n  Cromwell,” _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xx., October 1911, pp. 5-7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in Mr. Cust’s illustrated catalogue of the National\r\n  Portrait Gallery, vol. i. p. 19, and in the _Burlington Magazine_,\r\n  vol. xx. p. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  Described in chapter xxv.

Among them was a bust portrait, to\r\nthe right, with a jewel in the cap, and the Garter George suspended from\r\na black ribbon, lent by the Duke of Sutherland (No. 39, 20 in. × 17\r\nin.); a small half-length, to the left, wearing both collar and George\r\nof the Garter, from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (No. 160, 22½ in.\r\n× 17 in.); and versions of the Tyttenhanger picture lent by Mr. Charles\r\nPenruddocke (No. 162, 18 in. × 16 in.), and the Duke of Manchester (No.\r\n163, 14 in. × 11½ in.).[129] In addition to the Hollar print, engravings\r\nwere made, from one or other of the copies of the original picture, by\r\nHoubraken for his _Heads of Illustrious Persons_, 1745, from a picture\r\nin the possession of Mr. Edward Southwell, and by Freeman for Lodge’s\r\n_Portraits_, 1835, the latter from a picture in the possession of Sir\r\nThomas Constable, Bt., at Tixall. Probably both engravings were done\r\nfrom the same painting.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  A portrait of Cromwell, attributed to Holbein, the property of the\r\n  late Mr. J. P. Hardy, was sold at Christie’s on 13th December 1912.\r\n\r\nThere is a magnificent drawing, one of the most powerful studies Holbein\r\never accomplished, in the collection of the Earl of Pembroke and\r\nMontgomery at Wilton House,[130] which until recently has been generally\r\nregarded as a portrait of the Lord Privy Seal—though it bears little\r\nlikeness to the Tyttenhanger panel—because the words “Lord Cromwell” and\r\n“Holbein” have been inscribed in the bottom corners by a later hand than\r\nthe painter’s. It is in black and red chalk on paper tinted pink, with\r\nslight touches of colour on the fur of the gown and the jewel in the\r\ncap. The outlines of the features have been reinforced in ink, but this,\r\nin contradistinction to some of the drawings in the Windsor collection,\r\nwhere such retouching is evidently from a later hand, has been carried\r\nout with such power combined with delicacy that it seems certain that it\r\nwas done by Holbein himself. The drawing evidently at one time formed\r\npart of the Windsor series, at the date when the latter was given by\r\nCharles I to an earlier Earl of Pembroke in exchange for the little “St.\r\nGeorge” by Raphael, which is now in the Hermitage. This book of drawings\r\nwas afterwards given by Pembroke to the Earl of Arundel, and it is most\r\nprobable that the so-called “Cromwell” drawing remained behind, perhaps\r\nby accident. Quite recently it has been definitely identified as the\r\nportrait of George Nevill, third Lord Abergavenny, by means of a\r\nminiature in the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch, in water-colours,\r\non a playing card, which is based on Holbein’s drawing, and is inscribed\r\n“G. Abergaveny.”[131] It bears a very strong likeness to the drawing,\r\nand is attributed to Holbein himself. Further proof of identity is\r\nobtained from a picture, which agrees with the miniature but does not\r\nshow the hands, in the collection of the Marquis of Abergavenny at\r\nEdridge Castle, Kent. Both the Wilton drawing and the miniature were\r\nincluded in the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition, 1909 (No. 70 and\r\nCase C. No. 22), and the former was in the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No.\r\n1414).\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 263.

There are no dated portraits from his brush of the former year,\r\nwith the exception of the two small roundels in Vienna, and none of the\r\nlatter year, for the date on the beautiful miniature of little Henry\r\nBrandon at Windsor, usually given as 1535, has been misread.[132] There\r\nare one or two portraits which must have been done during this period,\r\namong them the Morette, the drawing of Nicolas Bourbon, and a portrait\r\nof Nicholas Poyns the younger; but there are so few examples which can\r\nbe definitely given to these two years that the writer hazards the\r\nconjecture that for a part of the time Holbein was out of England.\r\nThroughout his too short career the painter seems never to have severed\r\nhis connection with Basel, nor to have broken the friendly relationships\r\nwhich existed between him and its Council. He remained a citizen of his\r\nadopted city, and apparently retained his membership of the Painters’\r\nGuild, until his death. To do so he must have paid some heed to the\r\nsomewhat strict laws as to the duties of citizenship then in force. The\r\ncustomary leave of absence was about two years, and Holbein may well\r\nhave returned to Basel more often than is generally supposed. He did not\r\naccede to the Council’s request contained in their letter of September\r\n2nd, 1532, but at the end of two years, in the summer of 1534, he may\r\npossibly have paid a visit of some duration to Switzerland, returning to\r\nEngland in the summer or autumn of 1535. This is only conjecture, for\r\nthere is no evidence of his presence in Basel during that period, but it\r\nwould account for the lack of English portraits of that date, and would\r\nalso help to explain the fact—in some ways inexplicable—that he did not\r\nenter the service of the royal house of England until about 1536.\r\nAgainst this assumption it must be noted that when he paid his\r\nwell-known visit to Basel in September 1538 he was feasted and fêted by\r\nhis fellow-citizens in a way which seems to indicate that he had been\r\nabsent for a longer period than three years. Still, it is not impossible\r\nthat he was there in 1534-5, and that he even paid a final visit home,\r\nabout the winter of 1540-41, before his death in 1543, in this way\r\nretaining until the end his citizenship and the pension paid by the\r\nBasel authorities to his wife.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  See p. 225.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 12\r\n  CHARLES DE SOLIER, SIEUR DE MORETTE\r\n  ROYAL PICTURE GALLERY, DRESDEN\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wonderful portrait of Morette in the Dresden Gallery (Pl. 12)[133]\r\nmust certainly have been painted during the period under discussion.\r\nCharles de Solier, Sieur de Morette, a well-known French diplomatist and\r\nfighting man of his day, who had paid more than one earlier visit to\r\nEngland, in each case of short duration, arrived in London as French\r\nresident ambassador in place of Castillon, on Good Friday, April 3rd,\r\n1534, and returned to France on July 26th, 1535. This was his last and\r\nlongest sojourn in this country, and Holbein must have painted him\r\nbetween these two dates. Even though the painter may have paid a visit\r\nto Basel as suggested, it would still leave ample time for the portrait\r\nto have been taken in the summer of either year. Probably Holbein’s\r\nintroduction to Morette was brought about through the good offices of\r\nJean de Dinteville. Though the Bailly of Troyes had left England in the\r\nprevious November, Morette may have seen the “Ambassadors” picture in\r\nFrance in the interval, or have heard of it from Castillon, who\r\nsucceeded Dinteville in London. In any case, Morette, who was one of the\r\nspecial ambassadors who came over for the signing of the treaty in the\r\nspring of 1528, was acquainted with at least one work of Holbein, the\r\n“Battle of Spurs,” in the temporary banqueting-hall at Greenwich, to\r\nwhich the King had drawn the particular notice of the envoys.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 145. Reproduced by Davies, p. 156; Knackfuss, fig. 128;\r\n  Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 116.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ARUNDEL COLLECTION]\r\n\r\nThe first known reference to the portrait of Morette occurs in the\r\ncorrespondence of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, the great\r\ncollector of Holbein’s work, who employed friends and agents on the\r\nContinent to hunt up and buy everything from his brush that they could\r\ndiscover. He got together a remarkably fine series of pictures and\r\ndrawings by Holbein, which, on his death at Padua, 1646, came into the\r\npossession of his widow, then residing in Holland. Upon her decease in\r\n1654, at Amsterdam, her youngest son, Lord Stafford, who was living with\r\nher, propounded a nuncupative will in his own favour, and began as\r\nquickly as he could to sell the pictures, which it had been the\r\nintention of the Earl should become heirlooms, but the deed had never\r\nbeen executed. The sale, however, was stopped by other representatives\r\nof the Arundel family, and a lawsuit resulted. Among the documents in\r\nconnection with these proceedings was one of very great interest, an\r\ninventory of the pictures and objects of art in the possession of the\r\nCountess at the time of her death. The original list, which was in\r\nItalian, and probably drawn up for the Earl in Padua, has disappeared,\r\nbut a copy of it has been recently discovered by Miss Mary L. Cox in the\r\nRecord Office. This valuable document was evidently copied from the\r\noriginal by some clerk in Amsterdam ignorant of the Italian language,\r\nfor it is full of mistakes. The complete inventory was published by Miss\r\nCox, with an introduction by Mr. Lionel Cust, in the _Burlington\r\nMagazine_.[134] From it we learn that Lord Arundel possessed no less\r\nthan forty-one works by or attributed to Holbein, in addition to the\r\ndrawings, which are not included in the inventory. Among the portraits,\r\nsome of which have been already noted, were those of the Duchess of\r\nMilan, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Edward VI, the Duke of Norfolk and\r\nhis son the Earl of Surrey, Sir Thomas Wyat, Cromwell, Erasmus, the Earl\r\nof Southampton, Thomas and John Godsalve, Sir Edward Gage, Sir Henry and\r\nLady Guldeford, Archbishop Warham, Dr. John Chamber, Derich Born, and\r\nSir Thomas More and his family, as well as several unnamed portraits, to\r\nall of which reference will be found in these pages. Very possibly some\r\nfew of these pictures, such as the full-length of the Earl of Surrey,\r\nwere not by Holbein, though given to him in the list. Lord Arundel also\r\npossessed several works which so far have not been traced, though the\r\ntitles may help towards their future rediscovery. Among them is a\r\nportrait said to be of Holbein’s wife, which is most probably the\r\npicture at the Hague;[135] one of a lady “con gli mani giunti e un agato\r\natacato al beretino”; another of a lady, aged 40, with the inscription,\r\n“In all things, Lord, thy wilbe fulfilled”; the portrait of a\r\nmusician;[136] one of an armed man, which may possibly be the portrait\r\nof Sir Nicholas Carew; the portrait of the goldsmith Hans of Zürich; the\r\nDeath’s-head and bones already referred to in speaking of Ambrosius\r\nHolbein; a picture of gamblers or people playing games (“un quadretto\r\ncon divers figure Jocatori, &c.”); another with the title “Legge Vecchio\r\n& Nove” (ancient and modern law); and the Arms of England in\r\nwater-colours. Before his relations could interfere Lord Stafford had\r\nsold a number of pictures to the Spanish Ambassador in London, to\r\nEberhard Jabach, of Cologne, and to the agent of the Archduke Leopold,\r\nand this may account for the fact that certain of them remained abroad,\r\nsuch as the Jane Seymour and Dr. Chamber in Vienna, and the Thomas and\r\nJohn Godsalve in Dresden.\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  Vol. xix., August and September 1911, and vol. xx., January 1912, from\r\n  which the above facts are taken.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. p. 106.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  See above, p. 52.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Turin, dated November 26th, 1628, from Sir Isaac Wake\r\nto William Boswell, the former states: “The picture after which you do\r\nseem to inquire was made by Hans Holbein in the time of Henry VIII, and\r\nis of a Count of Moretta. My Lord of Arundel doth desire it, and if I\r\ncan get it at any reasonable price he must and shall have it.”[137] The\r\npicture was evidently then in the market, under the true names of both\r\nsitter and painter, but apparently the price was too high, and so\r\nArundel, who possessed the original drawing for it, was not able to\r\nsecure it. It was eventually bought by the Marquis Massimiliano\r\nMontecucculi, ambassador of the house of Este at Parma and Rome, and\r\npresented by him to the Duke Francesco d’Este, and so passed into the\r\nModena gallery. According to Venturi, the portrait was at that time\r\nattributed by the Marquis Montecucculi to “Gio. Olben.” Some thirty\r\nyears after the date of Wake’s letter, Scannelli, in his\r\n_Microcosmo_,[138] describes, under the name of “Olbeno,” a picture in\r\nthe Modena collection which can be no other than the “Morette.” He says:\r\n“There was also lately among ultramontane painters a certain Olbeno, a\r\nhighly qualified master, and in painting individual portraits verily\r\nstupendous. It is true in his execution there is something of that\r\nnative hardness which belongs to his country in other respects; yet\r\nthrough his extreme diligence and truthful fidelity to nature it shows a\r\nhigh degree of perfection. As we see, for example, in the already\r\nnoticed gallery of H.S.H. the Duke of Modena, where there is a\r\nhalf-length portrait by him which in its exact imitation of nature is\r\nquite wonderful.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  For this and other letters see Sainsbury, _Original Unpublished\r\n  Papers_, &c., 1859, Appendix, Nos. 44, 53, 55, 57.

See also Vol. i. p. 306.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF MORETTE]\r\n\r\nAt a later date the true name of the sitter appears to have become lost.\r\nIt has been suggested[139] that, owing to the similarity of the sound,\r\nthe name Morette was first changed to Morus, as the name of Sir Thomas\r\nMore would naturally suggest itself in connection with Holbein. In\r\nItaly, Morus, again naturally, would become Moro, and so in course of\r\ntime the picture was said to represent Lodovico Sforza, familiarly known\r\nas Il Moro. There is no need, however, to bring in the name of Sir\r\nThomas More at all. The change must have been directly from Morette to\r\nMaurus, which was Sforza’s second name, from which his popular nickname\r\n“Il Moro” was taken.[140] Holbein’s name in connection with the picture\r\nhaving been by this time forgotten, the title “Maurus,” combined with\r\nthe beauty of the work, gave rise to the supposition that it could only\r\nbe from the hand of Sforza’s great countryman, Leonardo da Vinci; and it\r\nwas as a portrait of Il Moro by Leonardo that it was purchased by\r\nAugustus III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, from the Duke\r\nFrancesco of Este-Modena in 1746. It formed part of a collection of\r\nabout one hundred pictures, known as the “Modena Gallery,” some of which\r\nare now among the chief masterpieces of the Dresden Gallery, which,\r\nafter long and secret negotiations, the Elector procured for his own\r\ncollection at the cost of one hundred thousand sequins and very liberal\r\nlargesse to various agents and go-betweens. For the next hundred years\r\nit remained at Dresden as a portrait of Lodovico and a masterpiece by Da\r\nVinci. Then Rumohr, the critic, pointed out that the style and quality\r\nof the painting proved it to be an undoubted work by Holbein, while at\r\nthe same time Von Quandt produced evidence to show that it did not\r\nrepresent Il Moro, but a certain jeweller employed by Henry VIII named\r\nHubert Morett. The paper he contributed to the _Kunstblatt_ in 1846 was\r\naccompanied by a reproduction of Hollar’s engraving of the original\r\ndrawing of the picture, upon which his case was based. This engraving is\r\ninscribed “Mr. Morett” and “W. Hollar fecit, ex Collectione Arundeliana.\r\nA^o 1647. 31 Decē.” In spite of Rumohr’s criticism, however, the picture\r\ncontinued to be described in the official catalogues as by Leonardo, the\r\nauthorities, it is said, objecting to the change of name, as in so doing\r\nthe collection would be robbed of its sole work by Da Vinci; and it was\r\nnot until the death of King Frederick Augustus that Holbein was allowed\r\nto come into his own again. There was considerable opposition, too, to\r\nthe change from Il Moro to Mr. Morett, the goldsmith, Hollar’s engraving\r\nbeing a poor one, and not very much like the picture. The title was not\r\nchanged, nor was the final restitution made to Holbein until 1860, in\r\nwhich year Holbein’s original drawing for the portrait made its\r\nappearance in London, in the sale of Samuel Woodburne, the art dealer,\r\nwhen it fetched £43, and was purchased immediately afterwards for the\r\nSaxon Government by Herr L. Gruner, the director of the Dresden\r\nGallery.[141] For the next twenty-five years the picture was known as\r\n“Mr. Hubert Morett, goldsmith to Henry VIII,” who was considered by all\r\nwriters to be an Englishman, his sumptuous apparel, quite unlike the\r\nsober garments worn by jewellers in those days, being explained away by\r\na reference to the tradition that in the sixteenth century all\r\nEnglishmen, of whatever class of society, had a passion for finery in\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 301, and Dresden Catalogue, 1884.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  See _Milan under the Sforza_, by C.

Reproduced by Wornum (photograph), p. 300.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Hubert Morett was not an Englishman at all, nor\r\ncould he be rightly described as “goldsmith” to Henry VIII. He was a\r\nFrenchman, one of several jewellers of Paris, who paid periodical visits\r\nto London for the purpose of selling their wares to the King and Court.\r\nThus, in August 1536, in Gostwick’s accounts, is the entry: “Hubbert\r\nMorret, jeweller of Paris, for jewels bought by the King £282, 6_s._\r\n8_d._,”[142] while in January 1532 he received 242 crowns, or £56, 9_s._\r\n4_d._, for similar goods.[143] Granger’s statement that Morett “did many\r\ncurious works after Holbein’s designs” has no foundation in fact.\r\nHollar’s engraving[144] simply calls the subject “Mr. Morett,” though\r\nParthey, in a second edition of his book, cites a second state of the\r\nengraving, sold in 1844, with the added words, “Jeweller to Henry VIII”;\r\nno one, however, has so far succeeded in discovering a proof of this\r\nstate, and, in all probability, these words were merely written on this\r\nparticular proof by someone who had noted the reference to Morett in the\r\n_Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VIII_, published by Nicolas in 1827.\r\nThis, no doubt, was the source of the legend, adopted at Dresden, that\r\nthe picture represented a court jeweller.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xi. 381.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. v., Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VIII, under January\r\n  1532.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Parthey, No. 1470.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF MORETTE]\r\n\r\nIt remained for a Swedish critic, M. S. Larpent, finally to re-establish\r\nthe identity of the sitter as that Count of Moretta mentioned in Wake’s\r\nletter in the seventeenth century. In a pamphlet published in\r\nChristiania in 1881, _Sur le Portrait de Morett_, he proved conclusively\r\nthat the Dresden picture represents Charles de Solier, Sieur de Morette.\r\nM. Larpent drew attention to the fact that the drawing for the head was\r\nonce in the possession of Richardson, the painter, and that at his sale\r\nin 1746 it was included in his catalogue as “One Holbein, sieur de\r\nMoret, one of the French hostages in England,” this, no doubt, being the\r\ntraditional title which had remained with the drawing since it was in\r\nthe Arundel collection. It has been suggested that Hollar’s engraving\r\nwas done neither from the Dresden picture nor from the drawing, as it\r\nshows considerable differences in the dress and details, and is circular\r\nin shape, while the inscription is “Holbein pinxit” not “delineavit,”\r\nindicating that it was done from a painting and not a drawing, and thus\r\nproving that the Earl of Arundel possessed another portrait of Morette,\r\nwhich has disappeared. In this connection Sir Sidney Colvin draws\r\nattention to the print by Hollar of an unknown man after a painting by\r\nHolbein formerly in the Earl of Arundel’s collection, which he thinks\r\nrepresents Jean de Dinteville.[145] “Now, this print of Hollar’s,” he\r\nsays, “is an exact companion to his other print from the ‘Mr. Morett’ in\r\nthe Arundel collection. Both are small rounds, apparently taken from\r\npaintings of almost miniature size, such as Holbein is in several\r\ninstances known to have made of persons who had also sat to him for\r\nfull-sized portraits. I conclude that he had painted two such companion\r\nminiatures, besides his larger pictures, of the two successive French\r\nenvoys, Dinteville and Morette, and that both came into the possession\r\nof the Earl of Arundel.”[146]\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  This is the print, already mentioned (see p. 44), in connection with\r\n  the fine Windsor drawing to which Miss Hervey first drew attention as\r\n  a possible likeness of Dinteville.\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  In a letter to _The Times_, 11th September 1890.\r\n\r\nThe identity of the sitter was established beyond all possibility of\r\ndoubt in 1903 by the late Mr. Max Rosenheim’s discovery of a fine\r\ncontemporary medallion portrait of the same personage, carved in\r\nboxwood, with his name and titles in full, and on the back his device of\r\na seaport, a horse, and a dolphin.[147] Charles de Solier was born in\r\n1480, and was fifty-four years old when resident ambassador in England\r\nin 1534, the year in which Holbein painted him. He represented him\r\nlife-size and half-length, standing facing the spectator, dressed in a\r\ndoublet of black satin, the sleeves of which, from the elbow downwards,\r\nare slashed with white silk. His surcoat is of the same black material,\r\nwith a heavy collar and lining of fur. Both dress and black cap are\r\ndecorated with gold tags, and in the latter he wears a circular gold\r\nenseigne with a figure of Fortune. Round his neck hangs a gold chain to\r\nwhich is suspended a medallion or watch-case of open-work. In his right\r\nhand he holds a glove, and his left, which is gloved, grasps the gilt\r\nand elaborately chased sheath of a dagger, suspended from his girdle by\r\na chain with a large tassel, such as the one worn by Dinteville. His\r\nlong beard of a reddish colour is touched here and there with grey. The\r\nbackground consists of a curtain of green damask. It is about 3 ft. 1\r\nin. high by 2 ft. 6½ in. wide.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  See _Burlington Magazine_, vol. ii., August 1903, p. 369. The\r\n  medallion is in the Salting Collection, and the costume is the same as\r\n  in the picture. The inscription runs: “CAROLVS · DE · SOLARIO · DNS ·\r\n  MORETY · ANNO · AGENS · L.”\r\n\r\nHolbein’s art, both in the subtle insight it displays into character and\r\nin its technical achievement, is seen in its highest manifestation in\r\nthis superb and nobly-dignified portrait, which bears the stamp of truth\r\nin every touch. The handling is both brilliant and delicate in all the\r\naccessories, in the fine modelling of the flesh, and in the wonderful\r\ndraughtsmanship of the right hand grasping the glove. As a likeness of a\r\nliving man and as an expression of the most intimate traits of his\r\ncharacter, it holds its own with any piece of portraiture in the world,\r\nand is, indeed, complete in every respect, displaying the finest taste\r\nin conception combined with consummate skill and unerring accuracy in\r\nexecution, and most harmonious colour. The original study for it, which,\r\nno doubt, once formed a part of the Windsor collection, and now hangs by\r\nthe side of the picture in Dresden, is unsurpassed for its truth and\r\nforce, and the subtlety with which the likeness is expressed by the\r\nsimplest means, eye and hand acting in perfect accord and allowing\r\nnothing essential to escape them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROUNDELS OF ENGLISHMAN AND WIFE]\r\n\r\nThe two small roundels, about six inches in diameter, portraits of a\r\nman, probably an Englishman, and his wife, in the Vienna Gallery[148]\r\n(Nos. 1482, 1484), formerly in the Schloss Ambras collection, are dated\r\n1534. They are fine works, almost in miniature, though they do not show\r\nHolbein at his highest point of achievement. The man, who has a\r\ndark-brown beard, wears a black cap and a scarlet surcoat on which the\r\nletters H. & R. are embroidered in black and gold, indicating that he\r\nwas in the service of Henry VIII. Across the background is inscribed:\r\n“ETATIS SVÆ 30. ANNO 1534.” The woman, of a very homely type of face, is\r\nwearing a dark-brown and black dress, and a white head-dress, which\r\nhides her hair and falls on her shoulders in the form of a cape. This\r\nhead-dress is identical with the one worn by the unknown lady in the\r\nWindsor collection (Holmes No. 10), which Sir Richard Holmes thought\r\nmight be a portrait of “Mother Jack,” nurse to Edward VI. It is\r\ninscribed: “ETATIS SVÆ 28. ANNO 1534.” Both portraits have now a very\r\ndark blue-green background with a small circular ring of gold round the\r\nouter edge. The two are evidently husband and wife, and the latter has\r\nmore the appearance of a German than an Englishwoman. It may be\r\nsuggested, therefore, though with diffidence, that it is not impossible\r\nthat these two small portraits represent Susanna Hornebolt and her\r\nhusband, John Parker, the King’s bowman and a yeoman of the robes. Dürer\r\nspeaks of Susanna as being “about eighteen” in 1521, which does not\r\nquite tally with the age of the sitter in the Vienna roundel, who was\r\ntwenty-eight in 1834, but it is again not impossible that Dürer imagined\r\nthe young lady to be two or three years older than she was in reality.\r\nDr. Ganz draws attention to the close likeness between this portrait and\r\nthe one of an unknown man, also a small roundel, in the possession of\r\nHerr F. Engel-Gros, at Château de Ripaille near Thonon,[149] which he\r\nreproduces for the first time. The sitter is clean-shaven, facing\r\nthree-quarters to the right, with a small flat red cap, elaborate black\r\nand white Spanish work on his shirt collar, and a red livery coat, lined\r\nwith blue, with black bands and the initials “H. R.” embroidered on it.\r\nHe considers him to be either a Netherlander or a German, and suggests\r\nthat he was possibly a painter in Henry VIII’s service. It may be\r\npermitted to go a step further and to suggest that we have here a\r\nportrait of Susanna’s brother, Lucas Hornebolt. It was first exhibited\r\nin Basel in 1891, and nothing of its earlier history is known. It bears\r\nno signature or date, but is evidently of the same period as the two\r\nVienna roundels. There is an excellent old copy on copper of this\r\nroundel in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (No. 537),[150] in which,\r\nhowever, the cap and coat are black, while no trace of the royal\r\ninitials on the latter can be discerned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 256, 257.

Poines\r\nKnight,” and they are generally regarded as portraits of a father and\r\nson, and are described as Sir Nicholas Poyntz the Elder, and Sir\r\nNicholas Poyntz the Younger. In the one he is represented almost\r\nfull-face, with beard and bare head, a free drawing without the black\r\nlines, and somewhat rubbed. The other is a small head in profile to the\r\nleft, with a short beard and moustache, wearing a round cap with white\r\nfeather, and a gold chain on his shoulders. There seems to be no great\r\ndifference between the ages of the two, and as Nicholas Poyntz’s father\r\nwas named Anthony, probably the inscription on the first-named drawing\r\nis incorrect, and the sitter is not a member of this family. There are\r\nvarious portraits based upon the second drawing, all apparently\r\ncontemporary copies of a lost original.[153] One of them was lent by the\r\nMarquis of Bristol to the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No. 79). It is a\r\nlife-size portrait, half-length, in a black dress, on panel, 24 × 17 in.\r\nAnother is described by Woltmann, who saw it in the possession of the\r\nMarquis de la Rosière in Paris.[154] It was photographed by Braun, but\r\nsince then has disappeared. It agrees with the drawing and Lord\r\nBristol’s picture. Both are inscribed on the right-hand side of the blue\r\nbackground:—“ETATIS SVÆ 25. ANNO 1535,” and above, a three-lined French\r\nmotto—“IE OBAIS A QVI IE DOIS. IE SERS A QVI ME PLAIST. ET SVIS A QVI ME\r\nMERITE.” Woltmann regarded the Paris example as a fine and genuine work\r\nby Holbein,[155] but it is only an old copy. There is another in the\r\npossession of Lord Spencer at Althorp. Wornum notes a miniature on\r\nvellum, with a plain blue background, then in the possession of Mr. R.\r\nS. Holford, of Dorchester House, which corresponds with the Windsor\r\ndrawing.[156] Sir Nicholas Poyntz was the eldest son of Anthony Poyntz,\r\nof Iron Acton, Gloucestershire, and Elizabeth, daughter and heir of\r\nWilliam Hudson, of Devonshire. He does not appear to have held any\r\noffice in connection with the Court. He married Joan, daughter of\r\nThomas, Lord Berkeley, and died in 1557.\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 301; Wornum, i. 9; Holmes, i. 47.

In 1534 he was thrown into\r\nprison, from which he was finally released through the intervention of\r\nHenry VIII, whose interest in him had been aroused both by Anne Boleyn,\r\nwho had made his acquaintance during her residence at the French Court\r\nin her younger days, and also by Henry’s physician, Dr. Butts. To show\r\nhis gratitude he came over to England in 1535, and found plenty of\r\nemployment in court circles as an instructor of youth. He returned to\r\nFrance in 1536, leaving many friends behind him. While in London he\r\nappears to have lodged with Cornelis Hayes, one of the chief goldsmiths\r\nemployed by the King. Among his more intimate friends were Kratzer and\r\nHolbein, as may be gathered from a letter which he wrote after his\r\nreturn to France to Thomas Solimar, the King’s secretary, in which he\r\nsays:—“I have yet to beg you to greet in my name as heartily as you can\r\nall with whom you know me connected by intercourse and friendship: Mr.\r\nThomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury ... Mr. Cornelius Heyss, my\r\nhost, the King’s goldsmith; Mr. Nicolaus Kratzer, the King’s astronomer,\r\na man who is brimful of wit, jest, and humorous fancies; and Mr. Hans,\r\nthe royal painter, the Apelles of our time. I wish them from my heart\r\nall joy and happiness!”[157]\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Woltmann, i. p. 404.\r\n\r\nBourbon held Holbein’s art in the greatest admiration, and more than one\r\nreference to it, couched in terms of high praise, appears in his printed\r\nworks. The original study for the portrait Holbein painted of him is\r\namong the Windsor drawings,[158] but the picture itself has disappeared.\r\nIn the sketch he is represented turned to the left, with a pen in his\r\nhand, as though in the act of composing. He has a small beard, and wears\r\na black cap over his long hair, and looks thoughtfully in front of him,\r\nthe right arm and hand being only roughly indicated. It is inscribed\r\n“Nicholas Borbonius Poeta,” and is a fine drawing, in excellent\r\ncondition, but some doubts have been expressed as to whether it really\r\nrepresents the poet. Bourbon was delighted with the portrait Holbein\r\npainted of him, and sings its praises in an epigram on the “incomparable\r\npainter” Hans Holbein, which he published in his _Nugae_. It runs:\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 311; Wornum, i. 30; Holmes, i. 54. Reproduced by Knackfuss,\r\n  fig. 123; _Drawings of Hans Holbein_, Pl. xxxv.\r\n\r\n              “Dum divina meos vultus mens exprimit Hansi,\r\n               Per tabulam docta præcipitante manu,\r\n               Ipsum et ego interea sic uno carmine pinxi:\r\n               Hansus me pingens major Apelle fuit.”\r\n\r\n    (“While the divine genius of Hans immortalises my features,\r\n    tracing them on the panel with skilful hand, I also have painted\r\n    him thus in verse; Hans, thus painting me, was greater than\r\n    Apelles.”)\r\n\r\nHolbein made a smaller drawing of the portrait, which was produced as a\r\nwoodcut for the 1538 edition of Bourbon’s poems, the _Nugae_. In this\r\nalso the poet is engaged in writing, but the position is reversed. It is\r\ninscribed “Nic. Borbonius Vandop. Anno Aetatis xxxii. 1535.” The\r\nportrait is circular, within a square, the corners being filled in with\r\nRenaissance ornament, and below two naked boys supporting a shield with\r\nBourbon’s coat of arms, a swan surmounted by a cross. On the last page\r\nis printed the following:\r\n\r\n                             “IN IMAGINEM SVI.\r\n              Corporis effigiem pictor saepe exprimit arte:\r\n                Forma animi nulla pingier arte potest.\r\n              Corpora corporeo mortalia lumine cernis,\r\n                O homo: noto Deus pectora solus habet.”\r\n\r\nBoth his friendship for Holbein and his admiration for his art find\r\nexpression in a further poem or epigram printed in the _Nugae_, headed\r\n“In picturam Hansi regii apud Britannos pictoris et amici.” The verses\r\ndescribe a miniature painting by Holbein:\r\n\r\n             “Sopitum in tabula puerum meus Hansus eburna\r\n                Pinxerat, et specie qua requiescit Amor:\r\n              Ut vidi, obstupui, Chaerintumque esse putavi,\r\n                Quo mihi res non est pectore chara magis\r\n              Accessi propius, mox saevis ignibus arsi;\r\n                Osculaque ut coepi figere, nemo fuit.”\r\n\r\n    (My Hans has painted on an ivory panel a slumbering boy, looking\r\n    like a reposing Cupid; I see him, I am astonished, I regard him\r\n    as Charintus, whom my heart loves most warmly; I approach\r\n    burning with passion, yet as I kiss him, it is only a\r\n    semblance.)\r\n\r\nAll traces of this miniature, which Bourbon extols so highly, have\r\ndisappeared. Two other laudatory references to Holbein occur in the\r\n_Nugae_. In the 1538 edition, which was published in Lyon in the same\r\nyear as the “Dance of Death” cuts and the Old Testament illustrations,\r\nthe following lines have reference to the former designs:\r\n\r\n                    “_De morte picta a Hanso pictore nobili._\r\n            Dum mortis Hansus pictor imaginem exprimit,\r\n            Tanta arte mortem retulit, ut mors vivere\r\n            Videatur ipsa: et ipse se immortalibus\r\n            Parem Diis fecerit operis huius gloria.”\r\n\r\n          (On the picture of Death by the noble painter Hans.\r\n\r\n    Painter Hans has expressed the image of Death with so much art,\r\n    that Death himself now seems a living being, and he by the glory\r\n    of his work has made himself the compeer of the immortal gods.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NICOLAS BOURBON AND HOLBEIN]\r\n\r\nThese verses read as though they were written to accompany the first\r\nedition of the “Dance of Death” woodcuts, but for some reason were never\r\nused. They are interesting, too, as containing the only contemporary\r\nreference to Holbein as the actual designer of the series. In the same\r\nedition occur the following lines:\r\n\r\n                “Videre qui vult Parrhasium cum Zeuxide,\r\n                  Accersat a Britannia\r\n                 Hansum Ulbium et Georgium Reperdium\r\n                  Lugduno ab urbe Galliae.”\r\n\r\nwhich may be paraphrased as—“Whoever wishes to see the painter equal to\r\nParrhasius or Zeuxis must call Hans Holbein from England and Georgius\r\nReperdius from the French town of Lyon.” Reperdius was the Italian\r\nengraver Reverdino, about whom little is known, except that much of his\r\nengraved work was after Primaticcio. The latter was working at\r\nFontainebleau at this period, and, if Bourbon is to be believed,\r\nReperdius was settled in Lyon, where the poet probably met him when\r\nvisiting that town for the purpose of making arrangements for the\r\nrepublishing of his _Nugae_.\r\n\r\nFor the second edition of the “Old Testament” illustrations, published\r\nin 1539, Bourbon furnished, as already noted,[159] a Latin poem in which\r\nHolbein, as the designer of the woodcuts, is compared with and placed\r\nabove the greatest painters of antiquity. It describes a scene in\r\nElysium, in which the three great Greek painters, Apelles, Zeuxis and\r\nParrhasius appear:\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. p. 227.\r\n\r\n               “Nuper in Elysio cum forte erraret Apelles\r\n                Una aderat Zeuxis, Parrhasiusque comes.”\r\n\r\nApelles breaks forth into a lament over the eclipse of their fame\r\nbrought about by Holbein, and exclaims:\r\n\r\n              “Holbius est homini nomen, qui nomina nostra\r\n               Obscura ex claris ac prope nulla facit.”\r\n\r\nThe verses are too long for quotation. Bourbon has added to them a Greek\r\ndistich, with its translation into Latin:\r\n\r\n            “Cernere vis, hospes, simulacra simillima vivis?\r\n             Hoc opus Holbinae nobile cerne manus.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 13\r\n  TITLE-PAGE OF COVERDALE’S BIBLE\r\n  1535\r\n  _From a copy in the British Museum_\r\n]\r\n\r\nNo other portrait by Holbein can be definitely attributed to the year\r\n1535. It was in this year that he lost two of his first English patrons,\r\nand both on the scaffold—Sir Thomas More and Bishop Fisher, and his\r\ndistress must have been keen, more particularly over the death of the\r\nformer, who had done so much for him when he first arrived in London, a\r\npractically unknown foreign painter, with no knowledge of the English\r\nlanguage. One other work of his, however, the design for the title-page\r\nof Coverdale’s Bible, in the publication of which Thomas Cromwell was\r\ngreatly interested, was issued in this year, and possibly it was he who\r\nplaced the commission in Holbein’s hands. It is interesting to note that\r\nHolbein, who illustrated the first translations of the Bible into German\r\nin Switzerland, also supplied a design for its first complete rendering\r\ninto English, which was published under the title of “Biblia. The Bible,\r\nthat is, the holy Scripture of the Olde and New Testament, faithfully\r\nand truly translated out of Douche and Latyn in to Englishe, M.D.XXV.”\r\nThis fine folio was printed in Zürich by Froschover, and no doubt\r\nHolbein’s title-page[160] (Pl. 13) was also cut abroad, for there was no\r\none in England at that time capable of producing so excellent an\r\nengraving. The design is divided into six little pictures which surround\r\nthe title. The one across the top contains the Fall and the Redemption;\r\non the left Adam and Eve stand under the Tree, and on the right Christ\r\nrises from the tomb, triumphant over Death and Hell. On the left-hand\r\nside of the page Moses is shown on Mount Sinai receiving the Tables of\r\nthe Law, and beneath him is a representation of Ezra reading the Old Law\r\nto the Jews on their return from the Captivity. On the opposite side, in\r\nthe upper picture, Christ is sending forth His disciples into the world\r\nto preach the gospel, and in the lower Paul is seen preaching. In the\r\npanel across the bottom of the page Henry VIII is seated on his throne\r\nunder a canopy, with a sword of state in one hand and a Bible in the\r\nother, which he presents to the high dignitaries of the Church and the\r\nnobles of his Court, who kneel below him. On either side within arched\r\nniches are the figures of King David playing the harp, and the Apostle\r\nPaul. The King is represented with a beard, which became the fashion in\r\nthe year Coverdale’s Bible was published, but in facial likeness there\r\nis little resemblance to Henry, due, possibly, to the fact that the\r\nblock was cut in Switzerland. The design, as a whole, is a particularly\r\nfine and effective one, and has not suffered to any great extent from\r\nthe cutting, which is good, though not the handiwork of a Lützelburger.\r\nCertain of the figures are of great beauty, in particular those of the\r\nrisen Christ, the Adam and Eve, and the Paul. The resemblance, in facial\r\ntype and movements, between the figure of the Saviour sending forth His\r\ndisciples to preach and the Christ in the “Noli me Tangere” picture at\r\nHampton Court, has been already noted.[161]\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 237. Reproduced by Woltmann, i. dedication; Davies, p. 192.\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. p. 97.\r\n\r\nThe few designs which Holbein made for woodcuts while in England appear\r\nto have been all done at about this time, when the abuses of the Church\r\nwere being attacked most severely and the monasteries were being swept\r\naway; though some of them were not actually published until some years\r\nlater. In them Holbein, just as he had done in his woodcuts produced in\r\nBasel, in no way attempts to disguise his adherence to the reformed\r\nreligion. This feeling was shown very strongly in a series of twenty-two\r\nsmall satirical drawings of the Passion which appear to have been\r\npreserved in a little book, now unfortunately lost. At one time it was\r\nin the possession of the Earl of Arundel, and was shown by him to\r\nSandrart as a work of Holbein’s. The latter mentions it in his _Teutsche\r\nAkademie_, stating that each sheet was full of little figures of every\r\nkind, that of the Redeemer always appearing under the form of a monk\r\nattired in black. Sixteen of these designs were engraved in the\r\nseventeenth century, no doubt while in the Arundel collection, and most\r\nprobably by Hollar, though they are unsigned and have not the customary\r\n“Ex Collec.

In them “the enemies of Christ are\r\nrepresented in the dress of monks and friars, and instead of weapons\r\nthey bear croziers, large candlesticks, and other church ornaments;\r\nJudas appears as a capucin, Annas as a cardinal, and Caiaphas as a\r\nbishop. In the subject of Christ’s Descent to Hades the gates are hung\r\nwith papal bulls and dispensations; above them are the Pope’s arms, and\r\nthe devil as keeper of the gate wears a triple crown.”[162]\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:\r\n\r\n  Chatto, _Treatise on Wood Engraving_, p. 378, note.

See also Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed.\r\n  Wornum, i. p. 98.\r\n\r\nWoltmann describes a second title-page, very finely cut, which he\r\nconsiders to have been produced during Holbein’s sojourn in England. So\r\nfar it has not been discovered in any published book, but there is a\r\nfine proof of it in the Munich Print Room. On either side stand St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul, the latter pointing upwards, two tall slender\r\nfigures. They appear as pillars of the church, and are represented as\r\nsupporting the blank title itself, which is in the form of a paper\r\nscroll. In an arch above is Christ risen from the Tomb, trampling upon\r\nDeath and Satan, and below are the arms of Henry VIII supported by two\r\nheraldic beasts.[163]\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 238.\r\n\r\nSomething of the same satirical feeling shown in the lost drawings of\r\nthe Passion is to be seen in two or three small woodcuts of this\r\nperiod, which, from the inferiority of the cutting, were very probably\r\nproduced in England. Two of them appeared among the twenty-six little\r\ncuts in _Cranmer’s Catechism_, a small octavo volume published in\r\n1548, the full title being, “Catechismus, that is to say, a shorte\r\ninstruction into Christian religion for the singular commoditie and\r\nprofyte of childrē and yong people. Set forth by the mooste reverende\r\nfather in God, Thomas Archbyshop of Canterbury, primate of all\r\nEnglande and Metropolitane.—Gualterus Lynne excudebat, 1548.” The\r\nfirst of Holbein’s two small pictures (folio CL) represents the\r\nparable of the Pharisee and the Publican,[164] the scene taking place\r\nin a church, with the Pharisee as a monk, kneeling at an altar, whom\r\nChrist points out to His disciples, while the Publican stands with\r\nhead bent in front of them. On the edge of a book on the altar steps\r\nare the initials “H. H.” The subject of the second cut (folio CCI) is\r\nChrist casting out the Devil from the possessed man,[165] which, in\r\nspite of the unsatisfactory cutting, is very dramatic and retains much\r\nof the beauty and individuality of Holbein’s design. The Pharisees and\r\nothers who stand behind are represented as bishops, monks and priests.\r\nIt is signed in full “HANS HOLBEN.” A third woodcut, very similar to\r\nthese, but still more feeble in execution, represents Christ as the\r\nGood Shepherd,[166] surrounded by His disciples, and pointing to the\r\n“hired servant,” here again dressed as a monk, who is flying before\r\nthe wolf which scatters his frightened flock. This also is signed in\r\nfull “HANS HOLBEIN.” It appears in a small English pamphlet, “A lytle\r\ntreatise after the manner of an Epystle, wryten by the famous clerk\r\nDoctor Vrbanus Regius,” which was also published by Walter Lynne, in\r\nthe same year, 1548, as the Catechism.\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 198.

The scene takes place in a magnificent chamber hung with\r\ntapestries, with the King, his legs apart in his characteristic\r\nattitude, seated on a throne beneath a baldachin bearing his arms. He is\r\nsurrounded by his councillors, twenty-seven in number, some listening,\r\nothers lost in thought, and others again whispering among themselves.\r\nThe cutting is excellent, and was probably done in Switzerland. The\r\nsocle with the framework enclosing the inscription “King Henry the\r\neyght,” and the two supporting sirens, are almost identical with the\r\nsocle and supports in the beautiful woodcut of Erasmus with the figure\r\nof Terminus already described. These, with the small portraits of Wyat\r\nand Bourbon, and the “Charitas” device for Reinhold Wolfe, constitute\r\nalmost the whole of Holbein’s work as a book-illustrator while in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 210.

Wyat was about the Court during the period under discussion; a\r\nfew years later he was often absent from England on foreign embassies.\r\nThere is a study for his portrait among the Windsor drawings (Pl.\r\n14)[168] which is one of the finest in the collection, though\r\nconsiderably rubbed and stained, and also a good, possibly contemporary,\r\ncopy.[169] He is represented nearly full-face, wearing a cap, and with a\r\nlong flowing beard, both hair and beard being modelled with the brush.\r\nThe portrait which must have been painted from this singularly\r\nattractive study is not now known to exist; a small painting in oils\r\ncorresponding to the drawing, but not by Holbein, was exhibited by Mr.\r\nBruce at the National Portrait Exhibition in 1866. A second portrait of\r\nSir Thomas was drawn by Holbein at a somewhat later date, which was\r\nreproduced as a woodcut, shortly after the poet’s death, in the little\r\nbook entitled _Næniæ in Mortem Thomæ Viati Equitis Incomparabilis_,\r\nwritten by John Leland, the antiquary, in honour of his memory, and\r\npublished in 1542. The portrait,[170] which is a small roundel in the\r\nstyle of the circular portraits in wax or boxwood which were at that\r\ntime much in vogue, may have been drawn by Holbein himself on the block.\r\nThe engraving itself is somewhat crudely done, but was, no doubt, the\r\nbest that could be procured at that time in London; yet in spite of its\r\nroughness the little portrait is a true likeness, full of character,\r\nsuch as no one in England but Holbein could have produced. Wyat is\r\nrepresented almost in profile to the right, with a long beard and a high\r\nbare forehead, bearing out Leland’s description in his panegyric that\r\n“nature had given the youth dark auburn hair, but this gradually\r\ndisappeared and left him bald, but the thick forest of his flowing beard\r\nincreased more and more.” The neck is bare, and bounded by a slight\r\ndrapery in the classical manner, giving it the appearance of a\r\nmedallion. Underneath the woodcut, which is printed on the reverse of\r\nthe title, are the following lines in praise of both painter and poet:\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 289; Wornum, i. 18; Holmes, i. 32.

II., PLATE 14\r\n  SIR THOMAS WYAT\r\n  _Drawing in black and coloured chalks_\r\n  WINDSOR CASTLE\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF SIR THOMAS WYAT]\r\n\r\nThe drawing, no doubt, was made by Holbein on purpose for the book, but\r\nwhether it was an original study from memory, or was based on a portrait\r\nof Wyat he had painted some little time previously, is uncertain.\r\nSeveral circular oil paintings exist which are either founded upon the\r\n_Næniæ_ woodcut, or are contemporary copies of a portrait by Holbein\r\nwhich cannot now be traced. The latter is the more probable supposition,\r\nas in all the paintings the head is turned to the left, whereas in the\r\nwoodcut it faces to the right, not having been reversed when drawn on\r\nthe block. One of these versions, formerly in the collection of the\r\nMarquis of Hastings, who lent it to the National Portrait Exhibition,\r\n1866, is now in the National Portrait Gallery (No. 1035);[171] a second,\r\napparently a copy from the former, is in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.\r\nThis latter was in the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No. 169), the Oxford\r\nExhibition of Historical Portraits, 1904 (No. 24), and the Burlington\r\nFine Arts Club Exhibition, 1909 (No. 50). It is a bust, three-quarters\r\nto left, with dark hair, beard, and moustache, and bald forehead, red\r\ndrapery round the shoulders, and a plain brown background; and is\r\ninscribed “SYR·THOMAS·WYAT.” A smaller circular portrait, also on an oak\r\npanel, belonging to the Countess of Romney, showing Wyat in the same\r\nposition, but dressed in the costume of his day, with a black coat lined\r\nwith white fur, is attributed to Lucas Cornelisz.[172] It is inscribed,\r\n“Sir Thomas Wiat. B.1503. D.1541. Lucas Cornelii,” but this is of a\r\nlater period than the painting, and the date of Wyat’s death is given\r\nwrongly. The head is in the same position as in the _Næniæ_ woodcut. On\r\nthe back of this portrait was at one time another panel, which now hangs\r\nby it in Lady Romney’s collection, representing Wyat’s “Maze,” and\r\npainted as a record of an amusing incident in his diplomatic mission to\r\nItaly in 1527. In the centre of the maze is shown a falling centaur with\r\nthe Pope’s triple crown on his head. There was a portrait of a Wyat in\r\nthe Arundel collection (_il ritratto del Cavaglier Wyat_), but whether\r\nthis was one of Sir Thomas, or the one of his father, now in the Louvre,\r\nis uncertain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 171:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in Mr. Cust’s illustrated catalogue of National Portrait\r\n  Gallery, vol. i. p. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xvi., December 1909, p. 155.\r\n\r\nThere are two very similar circular portraits in existence of Wyat’s\r\nson, Sir Thomas Wyat, the younger, which bear so strong a likeness to\r\nthe portraits of his father that at first sight they appear to have been\r\npainted from the same original. One of them was lent to the Burlington\r\nFine Arts Club, 1909 (No. 48), by the Rt. Hon. Lewis Fry, and the other\r\nbelongs to Lady Romney.[173] He is shown in profile, to the left,\r\nlooking upwards, the neck cut off at the beginning of the shoulders, as\r\nin the portraits of his father, and wearing a slight, light brown\r\nmoustache, pointed beard, and short hair. Lady Romney’s version is of\r\nthe same size as the Cornelisz portrait, while Mr. Fry’s more nearly\r\napproaches that of the National Portrait Gallery and Oxford portraits of\r\nhis father. Mr. Fry’s panel was once in the collection of Charles I,\r\nhaving his brand on the back, and it is possibly the portrait which was\r\nin the possession of John, Lord Lumley, in 1590. The “classical”\r\ntreatment followed in the cutting short of the bare neck has led to the\r\nerroneous supposition that the portrait has reference to Wyat’s\r\ndecapitation in 1554 for rebellion against Queen Mary. It is possible\r\nthat these portraits of the younger Wyat are based on a lost original by\r\nHolbein. He was born in 1521, so that he would have been twenty-two at\r\nthe time of Holbein’s death. Mr. Roger E. Fry sees in Mr. Lewis Fry’s\r\nversion a predominant Flemish influence. “It remains,” he says, “one of\r\nthe most inscrutable riddles of the exhibition. It is a work of such\r\ngreat technical excellence that its authorship ought to be discoverable.\r\nIt seems probable that it was painted in England and from life.”[174]\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:\r\n\r\n  Both reproduced in _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xvi., December 1909, p.\r\n  158; and the former in the illustrated edition of the Exhibition\r\n  Catalogue, Pl. xvi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xv., May 1909, p. 75.\r\n\r\nThe very interesting and beautiful portrait of a lady lent by Major\r\nCharles Palmer to the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, 1907 (No. 13),\r\nand to the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1909 (No. 64) (Pl. 15),[175] is\r\nnow identified, with some degree of certainty, as a portrait of Sir\r\nThomas Wyat the elder’s sister, Margaret Wyat, Lady Lee. This\r\nidentification is based upon an enlarged version of the portrait in the\r\npossession of Viscount Dillon at Ditchley, Oxfordshire, which, according\r\nto family tradition, is said to represent that lady, who was the wife of\r\nSir Anthony Lee, and the mother of Sir Henry Lee, K.G. She is shown at\r\nthree-quarters length, three-quarters to the left. Her hair, of reddish\r\ngold, is almost hidden by her black and white French hood decorated with\r\na band of pearls arranged in groups of four, alternating with small\r\npanels of gold filigree work. Her dress is of dark-brown damask, puffed\r\nat the shoulders, and ornamented with numerous gold tags or points, and\r\na rose-coloured petticoat. Her hands are clasped in front of her, and\r\nshe holds by a short ribbon a circular gold medallion on which is a\r\nfigure of Lucrece above a dark oblong stone. On her right hand are two\r\nsignet rings, one with a red and one with a dark stone. The dress, open\r\nat the neck, shows a white collar or lining, and white ruffles cover her\r\nwrists. A rose in red enamel is at her breast, and a gold chain round\r\nher neck. Across the plain dark green background is inscribed,\r\n“ETATIS·SVÆ·34.” It is on panel, 16½ in. × 12½ in. Her long, very sharp\r\nnose resembles that of her brother, and her complexion is of a somewhat\r\nunpleasant reddish tone. The drawing of the face, and particularly of\r\nthe hands, is very delicate. It is now in the Collection of Mr. Benjamin\r\nAltman, New York.\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xv., June 1909,\r\n  frontispiece; illustrated catalogue of Burlington Fine Arts Club\r\n  Exhibition, Pl. xxii.; and Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 143.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 15 PORTRAIT OF A LADY\r\n  (Probably Margaret Wyat, Lady Lee)\r\n  UNTIL RECENTLY IN THE COLLECTION OF MAJOR CHARLES PALMER, NOW IN THAT\r\n    OF MR. BENJAMIN ALTMAN, NEW YORK\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF MARGARET WYAT, LADY LEE]\r\n\r\nOpinion, so far, is divided as to whether this fine work is by Holbein\r\nor not. The first impression received is that it is certainly not by\r\nhim, from the flatness of the modelling of the face, a certain hardness\r\nin the execution, and the rather unpleasant red tone of the complexion;\r\nbut further examination considerably modifies this opinion. It is\r\ndifficult, if the attribution to Holbein is rejected, to suggest the\r\nname of any other artist then practising in England, who possessed the\r\nability to produce a portrait as fine and as remarkable as this one is.\r\nTo Sir Martin Conway “it appears to be obviously and all over\r\nHolbein.”[176] Mr. Roger E. Fry says that “opinion is so divided that it\r\nwould be rash to dogmatize. The picture is in wonderful condition and is\r\nentirely in Holbein’s manner. Indeed, it must in any case be derived\r\ndirectly from a drawing by Holbein. The only question to be settled is\r\nwhether the master himself ever became so entirely the craftsman\r\nabsorbed in the technical perfection of his work to the exclusion of the\r\nlarger issues of expression; whether he could have ever so far lost his\r\nsense of relief, treated line so entirely as a matter of edge with so\r\nlittle sense of the mass it should define. Such questions can only be\r\ndecided by a gradual consensus of opinion. My own belief is that it will\r\nbe decided ultimately against Holbein’s having actually executed the\r\npainting, though I am bound to admit no other known imitator comes as\r\nnear to Holbein himself as does the author of this.”[177] Dr. Ganz\r\nregards it as a genuine work by Holbein, and dates it 1540, drawing\r\nattention to the similarity of the enamelled rose fastened to her dress\r\nto the one worn by Lady Butts, who was painted by Holbein at about that\r\ndate.[178] It will be seen that the critics are divided; and it is\r\ncertainly by no means easy to arrive at a definite conclusion. It is\r\ninteresting to note, as a minor point, that the gold tags with which\r\nLady Lee’s dress is decorated are very similar to those on the surcoat\r\nof Sir Thomas Wyat in the Lucas Cornelisz portrait, and are arranged in\r\nmuch the same manner.\r\n\r\nFootnote 176:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xvi., December 1909, p. 159.\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, vol. xv., May 1909, pp. 74-5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  See Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 245.\r\n\r\nThe dated portraits of the year 1536 are only three, one of which, the\r\nSteelyard merchant, Derich Berck, has been already described.[179] The\r\nsecond is the portrait of Sir Richard Southwell in the Uffizi Gallery,\r\nFlorence (Pl. 16),[180] of which there is an excellent replica in the\r\nLouvre. It was finished on the 10th July 1536, when Southwell was\r\nthirty-three years old. It is a small half-length figure, the face\r\nthree-quarters to the right, wearing a black dress, open at the neck,\r\nwith black satin sleeves, and a black cap with a circular gold medallion\r\nwith a negro’s head carved in cornelian. His hands are folded, and he is\r\nwearing a gold ring with a green stone, and a gold chain round his neck.\r\nHe is closely shaven, and his black hair, which partly covers his ears,\r\nis cut straight across the forehead. Across the plain dark green\r\nbackground is inscribed on either side of the head in gold lettering:\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 22-23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 149. Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 108.\r\n\r\n              “· X^O · IVLII · ANNO          ETATIS · SVÆ\r\n               · H · VIII · XXVIII           ANNO XXXIII.”\r\n\r\nIt is on an oak panel about 19 in. high × 14 in. wide. This is one of\r\nHolbein’s finest portraits of his second English period, and displays a\r\nvery subtle insight into what must have been an unattractive and in many\r\nways despicable nature. The small brown eyes have a look of cunning, and\r\nthe face with its smooth fat cheeks has few pretensions to comeliness.\r\nSouthwell was heir to great wealth, and was brought up with Henry\r\nHoward, Earl of Surrey, and was intimate with the family of the Duke of\r\nNorfolk. In 1531 he was obliged to pay a fine of £1000 before he could\r\nobtain pardon for being concerned in a murder, yet three years later he\r\nwas Sheriff of Norfolk. From 1535 onwards he took an active share in the\r\ndissolution of the monasteries, and was in all ways a willing and able\r\ntool of his royal master. His treachery helped to bring Sir Thomas More\r\nto the scaffold, and, later on, he played an even more treacherous part\r\nat the trial of his early companion, the Earl of Surrey. He was knighted\r\nin 1542, and appointed one of the King’s executors, and under Queen\r\nElizabeth he became Master of Ordnance. Something of his unsavoury\r\ncharacter is suggested by Holbein in his portrait, which is\r\ndistinguished by its remarkable individuality and its fine technical\r\nqualities both in the flesh painting, more particularly in the hands and\r\nthe eyes, and in all the details of the costume. Nothing is known of the\r\nhistory of the picture except that it belonged to the Earl of Arundel,\r\nwho presented it to Cosimo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1620,[181] as\r\none of the best Holbeins in his collection. It is still in its\r\nseventeenth-century frame, with a silver tablet engraved with the arms\r\nof England and the Medici, and an inscription, “Effigies domini Ricardi\r\nSouthwelli Equitis aurati, consiliarii privati Henrici VIII, Regis\r\nAngliae.—Opus celeberrimi artificis Johannis Holbieni pictoris Regis\r\nHenrici VIII.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  See _Rivista d’Arte_, vi. 5, 6, 1909.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL.

It\r\nhas on the back the seal of the Newton family, and was brought by\r\nNapoleon from Germany in 1806. Another copy was lent to the National\r\nPortrait Exhibition at South Kensington, 1866, by Mr. H. E. Chetwynd\r\nStapylton. A portrait of Southwell, apparently based on Holbein’s\r\npicture, was lent to the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No. 217), by Mr. W. H.\r\nRomaine Walker. In this version Southwell’s coat of arms and the\r\ninscription “Copley Stili” are on the right-hand side of the background,\r\nand on the left “Richd. Southwell of Horsham St. Faith’s in Norfolk\r\nÆT.95.” The age in this inscription is altogether wrong, for Southwell\r\nwas fifty-seven at his death in 1561.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 218.\r\n\r\nHolbein’s study for the portrait is one of the most remarkable among the\r\nWindsor drawings.[183] The head and shoulders only are shown, but\r\notherwise it is almost identical with the Uffizi panel; even the four\r\nblack buttons which stand out against the white shirt are indicated in\r\nthe same position as in the finished work. It is inscribed “[A]NNO\r\nETTATIS SVÆ 33,” and bears the note in Holbein’s own handwriting, “die\r\naugen ein wenig gelbass” (the eyes a little yellowish). This study,\r\nwhich is about 16 in. × 11 in., is in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 304; Wornum, i. 20; Holmes, i. 34.

The sitter has greyish hair cut straight\r\nacross the forehead, and a short brown beard and moustache. His black\r\ncap has a number of gold tags and a medallion, and he wears a gown with\r\na brown fur collar over a black dress, a pleated white collar from which\r\nlong tags hang down, and a long gold chain over his shoulders. Across\r\nthe top, on the green-blue background, is the repainted inscription\r\n“ANNO D^E 1536 ÆTATIS SVÆ 43.” It has suffered considerable repainting\r\nabout the face, but it is a picture of much interest, and since it was\r\nlast exhibited has been acknowledged by most of the leading critics to\r\nbe a genuine work by Holbein. The original drawing for this picture,\r\nwhich shows some slight differences, is in the Windsor collection.[185]\r\nSir Thomas Strange or le Strange, of Hunstanton, Norfolk, was born in\r\n1493, and entered the service of Henry VIII as esquire of the body, was\r\nknighted, and accompanied the king to the Field of the Cloth of Gold.

There are two versions of it, one in the Prague Gallery (No.\r\n608),[186] and one at Hampton Court (No. 591 (337)).[187] Dr. Ganz\r\nregards both as old copies, but Sir Claude Phillips considers the former\r\nto be the original work by Holbein, and A. von Zahn says that it is\r\nindubitably original, but has suffered so severely and has been so\r\nheavily over-painted that little of Holbein’s handiwork is left. The\r\nHampton Court version is the better of the two, and is apparently an\r\nexcellent copy, though in technique of a somewhat later date.[188] It\r\nhas been held, nevertheless, by most English writers to be a genuine but\r\nbadly-damaged work of Holbein. The head has been repainted, which gives\r\nit that faded appearance noted by Mr. Wornum[189] and Dr. Waagen,[190]\r\nthough the latter attributed it to “the attempt to give the refinements\r\nof the modelling in grey half-tones,” in doing which Holbein “sacrificed\r\nthe warm local colours observable in his earlier pictures.” On the other\r\nhand, many of the accessories, such as the gold-and-enamel medallion,\r\nthe chain round her neck, the ring, and the cuffs, display a delicacy of\r\nexecution not easily attributable to anyone but Holbein. She is\r\nrepresented to the waist, almost full-face, the body turned slightly to\r\nthe spectator’s left, and is dressed in black, with ermine upon the\r\nsleeves, and the customary diamond-shaped hood, edged with pearls, and\r\nwith a black fall. She wears a thin black chain round her neck, and at\r\nher breast a circular brooch with a figure of the Virgin enthroned. Her\r\nhands rest in her lap, and in her right she holds a pink. It is on\r\npanel, 1 ft. 3 in. high by 11¼ in. wide. Mr. Law suggests that it is\r\nidentical with “The picture of Madame de Vaux, by Holbein,” which was\r\namong the Duke of Buckingham’s pictures sent to be sold at Antwerp,\r\nwhence it presumably returned with the “Dutch Gift,” and may, perhaps,\r\nbe identified with No. 410 in James I’s catalogue, described as “One of\r\nKing Henry VIII’s Queens, holding a gillyflower.”[191] There is a study\r\nfor the head among the Windsor drawings,[192] in which the strengthening\r\nlines are exceptionally hard and pronounced, and mar an otherwise fine\r\ndrawing. Holbein also painted her husband, though the picture has been\r\nlost, but the very beautiful drawing for it, described in a later\r\nchapter,[193] remains at Windsor. There is a second study of Lord Vaux\r\nby Holbein in the same collection.\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 243.

II., PLATE 17\r\n  SIR NICHOLAS CAREW\r\n  _Drawing in black and coloured chalks_\r\n  BASEL GALLERY\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF SIR NICHOLAS CAREW]\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Sir Nicholas Carew, Henry’s Master of the Horse, was\r\nprobably painted during the earlier years of Holbein’s second residence\r\nin London. It could not have been done later than 1537, for in 1538\r\nCarew was thrown into prison for supposed connection with the conspiracy\r\nof Cardinal Pole and the Marquis of Exeter, and was beheaded on March\r\n3rd, 1539. There is a brilliant study for this portrait in the Basel\r\nGallery (Pl. 17), a drawing in black and coloured chalks.[194] He is\r\nwearing body armour, and has a short beard and moustache; his hair is\r\nconcealed by a close-fitting coif, and there are an octagonal medallion\r\nand a white feather in his black cap. It is one of the most masterly\r\ndrawings Holbein ever made, searching in its truth, and of exact and\r\ndelicate draughtsmanship.[195] As it was included among the collection\r\nof works by Holbein formed by his friend and admirer, Bonifacius\r\nAmerbach, it may have been presented to the latter by the artist himself\r\nwhen he was in Basel in 1538.\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 31. Reproduced by Davies, p. 212; Ganz, _Hdz. Schwz. Mstr._,\r\n  iii. 40, and _Holbein_, p. xxxiii. Dr. Ganz is of the opinion that\r\n  this drawing is of Holbein’s first English period, and that the\r\n  finished portrait was painted in 1527 or 1528. See _Holbein_, p. 238.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  It has been suggested that the fine drawing of an English lady in the\r\n  same collection is a portrait of Lady Carew, but it more probably\r\n  represents Lady Guldeford. See Vol. i. p. 321.\r\n\r\nThe oil painting done from this study is in the collection of the Duke\r\nof Buccleuch and Queensberry, K.G.,[196] and was last publicly exhibited\r\nat the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1909 (No. 45). It is a\r\nthree-quarters length, turned to the left as in the drawing. The beard\r\nis brown, and the coif below the black hat is of cloth of gold. The\r\noctagonal gold badge represents a tree stem raguly and a banderole\r\ninscribed “SOLA.” He is wearing full plate-armour, and brown trunks\r\nslashed with cloth of gold. With his right hand he holds a white\r\ntruncheon against his hip, and with the other grasps his sword by the\r\nscabbard. The background is a green damask curtain, and on a small\r\ncartellino in the left-hand bottom corner is inscribed in a cursive hand\r\n“SR NICHOLAS CAREWE, MASTER OF THE HORSE TO KING HENRY YE 8.” It is on a\r\npanel of unusual shape, being 36 in. high by 40 in. wide. This picture,\r\nas a whole, is a fine and interesting example of Tudor portraiture, but\r\nparts of it are certainly not by Holbein. The head is good, but the\r\narmour and many of the details are by some other, and possibly a later,\r\nhand. The probabilities are that it was begun by Holbein and finished by\r\nsomeone else; perhaps the arrest of Carew may have brought the\r\ncompletion of the work to an abrupt conclusion as far as Holbein was\r\nconcerned. The fact that his name is given on the cartellino suggests\r\nthat the portrait may be a posthumous one. It was not the usual custom\r\nat that time to place more than the date and the age of the person\r\ndepicted upon the panel. Except in the form of a superscription to a\r\nletter held by the sitter, as in the Kratzer, Cromwell, and some of the\r\nSteelyard portraits, Holbein was not in the habit of adding the name to\r\nthe pictures he painted in England. The “Duchess of Milan” is an\r\nexception,[197] but even here there is every probability that the\r\ncartellino was painted in at a later date. It is difficult to decide\r\nwhether the Carew portrait was begun by Holbein and finished by some\r\nother hand, or whether it is an almost contemporary copy from some lost\r\noriginal. The head follows the Basel drawing closely, but as the latter\r\nwas owned by Amerbach it is improbable that a copyist could have made\r\nuse of it; so that, taking all things into consideration, it is safer to\r\nassume that Holbein himself had a share in its painting.[198] This\r\nportrait was in the possession of John, Lord Lumley, in 1590, and was\r\nsold from Lumley Castle in 1785 for ten guineas. In the inventory of\r\n1590 it is described as “Of S^r Nichls Carewe M^r of the horse to\r\nK:H:8”; and it is interesting to note that the words “drawne by Haunce\r\nHolbyn” are not added, as they are after several other works by the\r\nmaster which Lord Lumley possessed. It has been suggested that this\r\nportrait is the “Ritratto d’homo armato” of the Arundel inventory of\r\n1655, but if the picture remained in the possession of the Lumley family\r\nuntil 1785 this supposition cannot be correct. Symonds, in his\r\nNote-Books, has an entry of “A Ritratto of an English knight by Holbein\r\nwho sits in a chayre and a table by him,” in the collection of the Earl\r\nof Northumberland in Suffolk House, which seems to refer to this\r\npicture.[199]\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 142.

VIII (1528) to May, 23rd Hen. VIII (1531), during\r\nwhich period Holbein was out of England; the Privy Purse Expenses of the\r\nKing, from November 1529 to December 1532; and further Accounts of Tuke,\r\nas Treasurer, from Lady Day, 29th Hen. VIII (1538) to Midsummer, 33rd\r\nHen. VIII (1541). Although Holbein was in England during the latter half\r\nof 1532, his name does not occur in the Privy Purse expenses, as it\r\ncertainly would have done had he then been in the King’s employment.\r\nUnfortunately, no accounts have been preserved for the period between\r\n1533 and 1537, and so it is not until 1538 that we have definite proof\r\nthat the painter was in receipt of a regular salary from the royal\r\npurse. The first entry referring to him is at Lady Day, 1538, when the\r\nfollowing occurs: “Item, for Hans Holben, paynter, vii_li._ x_s._” As\r\nhis salary of £30 a year, paid quarterly, was not as a rule paid in\r\nadvance, he must have already been in the royal service at least three\r\nmonths earlier, that is in December 1537.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN’S ENTRY INTO ROYAL SERVICE]\r\n\r\nThe first actual reference to him as painter to the King is contained in\r\nthe letter of Nicolas Bourbon, already quoted, written early in 1536, in\r\nwhich he speaks of him as the “royal painter,” and it is to be inferred\r\nfrom it that Holbein already held that position in 1535, when the poet\r\nwas in England and made his acquaintance. The circular miniature of Jane\r\nSeymour by Hilliard in the Windsor Collection, apparently copied from an\r\noriginal by Holbein, is inscribed “ANŌ DNĪ 1536 ÆTATIS SVÆ 27”; and the\r\ngreat painting of Henry VII, Henry VIII, Elizabeth of York, and Jane\r\nSeymour, with which Holbein covered one of the walls of the Privy\r\nChamber at Whitehall, was done in 1537. None of the earlier portraits of\r\nHenry or of his two first queens, usually ascribed to Holbein, are\r\nauthentic works of his, which affords some proof that he did not enter\r\nthe royal service until after Jane Seymour had been crowned Queen in\r\n1536, or, if Bourbon is to be believed, that at least he did not do so\r\nuntil towards the end of Anne Boleyn’s life. The small portrait of Henry\r\nVIII on the frontispiece of Coverdale’s Bible, printed in 1535, bears\r\nlittle real likeness to the King, and may well have been designed by\r\nHolbein without any sitting from him; though, on the other hand, it may\r\nalso be taken as some indication that he was already the King’s servant\r\nin that year. It is safer, however, to assume, as the evidence for an\r\nearlier year is so scant, that he received his first pay from the royal\r\npurse in the autumn of 1536.\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary, and indeed almost inexplicable, that Holbein was at\r\nwork for so long a time in England before he received royal recognition.\r\nThat this did not happen during his first sojourn in London is\r\nsurprising enough, but that on his return he should remain for three or\r\nfour years busily employed in painting portraits of people about Henry’s\r\ncourt, some of which the King must have seen, is still more difficult of\r\nexplanation. Henry entered into keen but friendly rivalry with Francis I\r\nin his patronage of art, and was anxious at all times to induce good\r\nforeign artists to settle in England; and yet here was a painter of\r\ngifts which placed him high above his fellows, who, apparently, went\r\nquite unrecognised. This is the more remarkable when it is remembered\r\nthat the King was well acquainted with, and had expressed his delight\r\nin, at least one work of Holbein done during his first English\r\nvisit—“The Battle of Spurs,” which decorated the back of the arch of the\r\ntemporary Banquet Hall at Greenwich. It is hardly possible that it was\r\nowing to any disinclination on Holbein’s own part, however anxious he\r\nmay have been to retain his rights as a citizen of Basel. He could have\r\nentered Henry’s service for a year or two without renouncing his\r\nburghership, or becoming a naturalised English subject, and that he did\r\nobtain the post in the end seems to indicate that the obstacle, whatever\r\nit may have been, was not one of his own making. It was, on the other\r\nhand, an honour to which he would aspire, and the possibility of holding\r\nsome such position must have been one of the reasons which induced him\r\nto visit this country, as it was with all the foreign artists and\r\ncraftsmen who made London their temporary home. A satisfactory\r\nexplanation of this mystery is hard to find, and unless further evidence\r\nis discovered, it must remain unsolved.\r\n\r\nThat there is some possibility that Holbein was indirectly employed by\r\nthe Crown even earlier than 1535 is suggested by an interesting\r\nmemorandum dealing with goldsmiths’ work published in the Calendars of\r\nLetters and Papers. The paper is undated, but is placed by the editor\r\nunder the year 1534. It is an account rendered to the King’s Secretary,\r\nThomas Cromwell, by the Dutchman Cornelis Hayes, one of the leading\r\nforeign goldsmiths in London during Henry’s reign, who was constantly\r\nemployed by the King and the court. The articles supplied were\r\napparently for the royal service, the chief among them being an\r\nelaborately decorated silver cradle, which may possibly have been for\r\nthe use of the Princess Elizabeth, who was born on the 7th September\r\n1533. The document runs as follows:\r\n\r\n“Parcels delivered to Mr. Secretary by me, Cornelys Hayes, goldsmith. A\r\nsilver cradle, price 16_li._ For making a silver plate, altering the\r\nimages, making the roses underneath the cradle, the roses about the\r\npillars, and new burnishing, 13_s._ 4_d._ For the stones that were set\r\nin gold in the cradle, 15_s._; for fringes, the gold about the cushions,\r\ntassels, white satin, cloth of gold, lining, sypars, and swadyl-bands,\r\n13_s._ 6_d._ Total, 18_li._ 1_s._ 10_d._ The silver that went to the\r\ndressing of the Adam and Eve, the making of all the apples, the gilding\r\nof the foot and setting of the currall (coral), 33_s._ 4_d._ To Hance,\r\npainter, for painting the same Adam and Eve, 20_s._”[200] Other items\r\nare included in the account which need not be quoted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. vii. 1668.\r\n\r\nThe “Hance, painter,” who supplied this picture of “Adam and Eve,” was\r\nundoubtedly Holbein, who was acquainted with Hayes, as we learn from\r\nBourbon’s letter, and for whom he almost certainly provided designs for\r\njewellery.[201] The document is not very clear, and on a first reading\r\nit would appear that the “Adam and Eve” formed part of the decoration of\r\nthe cradle; but it is more probable that it had nothing to do with it,\r\nbut was a separate piece of work, either a picture or a carving in wood,\r\nhonestone, or alabaster, which Holbein was employed to colour; possibly\r\nthe latter, as the fee paid, twenty shillings, was a small one for an\r\noriginal painting from his brush. Whether picture or carving, it was\r\nevidently set in a very elaborate silver frame, decorated with silver\r\napples in relief, as appropriate to the subject it contained, and with\r\ncoral inset. No trace of this work remains, but the possibility that\r\nHolbein’s share in it was a small picture recalls that earlier “Adam and\r\nEve” of the first Basel years, which, as already noted,[202] bears a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to the heads in the picture of the same subject\r\nby Mabuse in Hampton Court.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  The same paper contains an item for “the garnishing of two books with\r\n  silver-gilt, 66 oz. at 6_s._,” which recalls Holbein’s designs in the\r\n  British Museum for work of a similar kind. The velvet for covering\r\n  them was supplied by William Lock, the leading London mercer, at a\r\n  cost of 43_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. p. 56.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAITS OF HENRY VIII]\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous portraits of Henry VIII to be met with in so many of\r\nthe great houses of this country and in several European museums, which,\r\nin almost all cases, are attributed by their owners to Holbein, only\r\nthree[203] can be ascribed to him with any certainty. These are the\r\nlarge cartoon for the left-hand half of the Whitehall wall-painting,\r\nbelonging to the Duke of Devonshire; the beautiful little panel portrait\r\nin Earl Spencer’s collection at Althorp; and the crayon study in the\r\nMunich Gallery. The greater number of the remaining portraits of him,\r\nmost of them based on the Whitehall likeness, are merely inferior\r\ncopies, and copies of copies, “shop” pieces supplied to order by Henry’s\r\npainters for presentation to foreign potentates and ambassadors, and to\r\nhis own statesmen and courtiers as a reward for faithful service. Less\r\nfrequently one is met with which is a good and original work by some\r\npainter of lower rank than Holbein, and such portraits, in their turn,\r\nhave been multiplied by assistants in order to meet the constant demand\r\nfor the King’s likeness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  A fourth work, the portrait in the National Gallery, Rome, is,\r\n  however, considered by Dr. Ganz and other critics to be an original\r\n  work by Holbein.\r\n\r\nThe great Whitehall fresco was painted in 1537, and was the first work\r\nof importance which Holbein undertook for the Crown. It achieved immense\r\npopularity, and for one hundred and fifty years or so every foreign\r\nvisitor of distinction was taken to see it, while all artists who had an\r\nopportunity of examining it spoke loudly in its praises. It covered one\r\nof the walls in the Privy Chamber at Whitehall, and was painted on\r\neither side and over the top of a window, or, more probably, the\r\nfireplace, and consisted of four great figures, Henry VIII and his\r\nfather, Henry VII, on one side, and his mother, Elizabeth of York, and\r\nhis third wife, Jane Seymour, on the other, arranged within an\r\nelaborately designed architectural setting. This great work, which added\r\nso much to Holbein’s fame among his contemporaries, was destroyed in the\r\nfire at Whitehall in January 1698; but happily, owing to the foresight\r\nof Charles II, we still possess, in the small copy of it by the Flemish\r\nartist Remigius van Leemput, in Hampton Court[204] (No. 601 (308)), a\r\nvery valuable record of the composition of the work. The copy is\r\nevidently a very faithful one, and though, of course, it lacks all the\r\ngreatness of style, the vividness of character, and the beauty of colour\r\nof the original—for Remée was a poor artist—it reproduces the\r\ncomposition with some exactitude, and so is invaluable to students of\r\nthe master. This copy was made by Van Leemput in 1667, the probable\r\nreason being that the fresco was then beginning to show signs of decay,\r\nand that Charles was anxious to retain an accurate record of it before\r\nit was ruined. Patin, who visited England about 1670, and saw both the\r\npainting and the copy, said that the latter was ordered by the King\r\n“pour en estendre la posterité s’il faut ainsi dire, et n’abandonner pas\r\nune si belle chose à la fortune des temps.”[205] Walpole says that\r\nRemée, as he was familiarly called here, received £150 for his\r\nwork,[206] which was a very large fee for those days, and shows how\r\nhighly the King valued the original.\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 179, from Vertue’s engraving.\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  Patin, _Relations historiques_, Basel, 1673, p. 211 _et seq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, 1888, i. p. 82.\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:\r\n\r\n  “Zo wel getroffen, dat het den beschouwer met verbaastheid aandoet.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE WHITEHALL WALL-PAINTING]\r\n\r\nThe wall-painting itself was still in perfect condition when Van Mander\r\nsaw it in 1604. He was deeply impressed by this “over-heerlijk Portret”\r\nof Henry, which, he wrote, was so true to life that it filled the\r\nspectator with dismay.[207] “The King, as he stood there, majestic in\r\nhis splendour, was so life-like, that the spectator felt abashed,\r\nannihilated, in his presence.” Earlier travellers who saw it and praised\r\nit were Johann Fischart, in 1576,[208] and Hentzner, who visited England\r\nin 1598; while Duke Johann Ernst of Saxony, who was here in 1613, was\r\nalso taken to see it; it is noted in the records of his journey, “upon\r\nthis his Royal Highness was conducted into the King’s apartment; it was\r\nsmall but hung with beautiful tapestries on all sides. In this room were\r\nthe full-length portraits of Henrici VIII, and his father, Henrici VII.\r\nThey were regarded as special works of art, and similar works are said\r\nnot to be seen throughout England.” Both Pepys and Evelyn mention it in\r\ntheir diaries. The latter, under the date 11th February 1656, says he\r\nwas glad to find, on revisiting Whitehall for the first time for many\r\nyears, that “they had not much defac’d that rare piece of Hen. VII, &c.,\r\ndon on the walles of the King’s privy chamber.” This entry proves that\r\nten or eleven years before Charles II ordered the copy to be made the\r\nfresco was beginning to show signs of decay. It narrowly escaped\r\ndestruction in the earlier fire at Whitehall in 1691, but the\r\nconflagration of 1698 was a much more serious one. It burnt down the\r\nentire Palace, with the exception of the Banqueting House and a few\r\nbuildings adjoining it. More than a thousand apartments perished in the\r\nflames, and a number of pictures in the Matted Gallery and elsewhere,\r\nmentioned by Evelyn, were destroyed. “This terrible conflagration, which\r\nbroke out about four in the afternoon and lasted upwards of seventeen\r\nhours, originated through the neglect and carelessness of a laundress, a\r\nDutch woman, who had left some linen to dry in front of a fire, in the\r\nlodging of a certain Colonel Stanley. She and twelve other persons, so\r\nit is reported, perished in the flames.”[209]\r\n\r\nFootnote 208:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. xxxviii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Sheppard, _The Old Royal Palace of Whitehall_, 1901, pp. 385-6.\r\n  According to Scharf, _Old London_, p. 322, the fresco was destroyed in\r\n  the fire of 1691.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the large cartoon and Van Leemput’s copy a very good idea\r\nof the general effect and composition of the picture can be obtained. It\r\nis divided into two stages. On the spectator’s left hand stands Henry\r\nVIII, turned fully to the front, with arms akimbo, and legs stretched\r\nwidely apart, and opposite him, on the other side of the picture, is\r\nJane Seymour. Behind and above the King, and to the right of him, on a\r\nraised step or low platform, stands his father, Henry VII, and in a\r\ncorresponding position on the other side, his mother, Elizabeth of York.\r\nHenry was very proud of his legs, and Holbein has depicted him in his\r\nfavourite attitude. He holds a glove in his right hand, and with the\r\nleft the cord of his dagger, gold hilted, with a gold and blue velvet\r\nsheath. His gold-brown doublet is richly jewelled, and his red surcoat\r\nis trimmed with fur and elaborately brocaded with gold thread; a heavy\r\njewelled chain crosses his shoulders, and from another hangs a pendant.\r\nHis flat black bonnet is ornamented with pearls, devices in gold, and\r\nwhite feathers. The figure is rather larger than life-size, but looks\r\ncolossal. His shoulders appear enormous, partly owing to the dress, and\r\npartly, no doubt, through some exaggeration on the artist’s part to\r\nflatter the vanity of his royal sitter. Henry VII is shown in simpler\r\ncostume; with his right hand he holds together the folds of his long\r\nermine-trimmed gown, his left elbow resting on the marble pedestal which\r\nVan Leemput has placed in the centre in lieu of the window or\r\nchimney-piece which occupied the same position in the wall itself. He\r\nholds his gloves in his left hand, and has the Garter collar across his\r\nbreast. Unlike his son, he is beardless, and his long hair falls to his\r\nshoulders. Jane Seymour is wearing a dress of tawny gold, full ermine\r\nsleeves, and several necklaces of pearls. Her hands are clasped in front\r\nof her, and a small white dog is lying on the long skirt of her gown.\r\nBehind her, Elizabeth of York stands with her arms crossed, and holding\r\nup her dress with her right hand. The floor is covered with a Turkey\r\ncarpet, and the background consists of richly-decorated pilasters and\r\ncapitals, niches, and a frieze, in various coloured marbles, in the\r\nRenaissance style of which Holbein made such brilliant use. In the\r\nfrieze on either side are figures supporting a shield. The shield shown\r\nin the cartoon bears the initials H and J; the other, no doubt, gave the\r\ndate. In Van Leemput’s copy the initials have been changed to “AN^o.\r\nDō.” with “1537” in the corresponding panel, while the centre of the\r\npicture is filled with a high marble pedestal, with two cushions on the\r\ntop, and on the front of it a long Latin inscription in praise of the\r\ntwo monarchs. Below this is inscribed: “Prototypvm Magnitvdinis Ipso\r\nOpere Tectorio Fecit Holbenivs Ivbente Henrico VIII,” and a little\r\nbelow, on a plinth: “Ectypvm A Remigio Van Leempvt Breviora Tabella\r\nDescribi Volvit Carolus II. M.B.F.E.H.R. A°. DNI. M.DCLXVII.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 18\r\n  HENRY VII AND HENRY VIII\r\n  _Cartoon_\r\n  Duke of Devonshire’s collection\r\n  UNTIL RECENTLY AT HARDWICK HALL, NOW AT CHATSWORTH\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CARTOON OF HENRY VII & HENRY VIII]\r\n\r\nVan Leemput’s inferiority as an artist is shown most clearly in his\r\nrendering of the faces. In that of Henry VIII, in particular, the\r\ndrawing is weak and lacking in character, and as a likeness it bears no\r\nclose resemblance to the many portraits still existing which were copied\r\nor adapted from the fresco. It must be regarded, therefore, as a not\r\nvery reliable record of the facial appearance of the four sitters as\r\nHolbein painted them.\r\n\r\nThe pedestal was, no doubt, Van Leemput’s own invention, and the Latin\r\nverses must have been specially written for the purpose of his copy. As\r\nalready pointed out, the wall on which the fresco was painted contained\r\neither a window or a fireplace. Charles Patin describes it as “sur le\r\npignon de la croisée”; but it has been suggested that “croisée” is a\r\ntypographical error for “cheminée.” Patin, however, was not a very\r\ncareful observer, for he speaks of the subject as “de la main d’Holbein,\r\nle portrait d’Henry huit et des Princes ses enfants.”[210] In this,\r\nnevertheless, he may not be so completely wrong as at first sight\r\nappears. In 1897 Mr. Ernest Law, the historian of Hampton Court Palace,\r\ndiscovered another copy of the great wall-painting, also by Van Leemput,\r\nand of the same size and scale as the Hampton Court example, but with\r\none important difference. In the middle foreground the copyist has\r\nplaced a standing figure of Edward VI. This interesting little picture\r\nbelongs to Lord Leconfield, and is in one of the private bedrooms at\r\nPetworth, Sussex. Patin may have seen this copy, and afterwards may have\r\nconfused it with the wall-painting; or again, he may have confused the\r\nfresco with the picture of Henry VIII and his family, by an unknown\r\nartist of the school of Holbein, now in Hampton Court, No. 340 (510),\r\nbut probably in Patin’s day hanging in Whitehall.[211]\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\n  Patin, _Relations historiques_, Basel, 1673, p. 211 _et seq._\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\n  It is hardly possible that the figure of Edward VI was added to the\r\n  wall-painting itself after the death of Holbein, or otherwise it would\r\n  appear in both Van Leemput’s copies. It was, no doubt, taken from some\r\n  independent portrait of the young king then hanging in Whitehall.\r\n\r\nThe life-size cartoon of Henry VIII and his father, belonging to the\r\nDuke of Devonshire, until recently at Hardwick Hall (Pl. 18),[212] is,\r\nthough only a working drawing, a superb example of Holbein’s mastery of\r\ncomposition on a monumental scale. It is the original design for the\r\nleft-hand part of the Whitehall fresco, and along its outlines the\r\nprickings are still visible by means of which the design was pounced on\r\nthe wall. It provides evidence that Van Leemput’s copy was a faithful\r\none, for, with one important exception, the two agree in all points. The\r\nexception is in the position of the King’s head. In the cartoon it is\r\nabout three-quarters to the right, but in the copy it has been turned so\r\nthat the monarch is looking directly at the spectator. Woltmann is, no\r\ndoubt, right when he suggests that the change was made by the express\r\nwish of Henry himself while the wall-painting was in progress.[213] He\r\ndesired to be shown full-fronted to the world, for he was proud of his\r\nappearance, more particularly of his calves, as more than one\r\ncontemporary anecdote shows. In his younger days, at the beginning of\r\nhis reign, he was the most commanding figure at the English court,\r\npraised by all for his good looks, and celebrated for his great bodily\r\nstrength and for his proficiency in all manly sports and exercises. He\r\nis thus described by the Venetian ambassador Pasqualigo in 1515; “His\r\nMajesty is the handsomest potentate I ever set eyes on; above the usual\r\nheight, with an extremely fine calf to his leg; his complexion very fair\r\nand bright, with auburn hair combed straight and short in the French\r\nfashion; and a round face so very beautiful, that it would become a\r\npretty woman, his throat being rather long and thick.”[214]\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  Now (1913) at Chatsworth.

In the cartoon he stands boldly and firmly on his legs, active\r\nand alert, though massive in build, and made still broader in appearance\r\nby his rich apparel, heavily padded about the shoulders. It is in the\r\nface that his age and the habits of his life are beginning to leave ugly\r\nindications, though this is not to be gathered from the cartoon, in\r\nwhich his features, badly rubbed, are now barely discernible. This,\r\nhowever, may not be entirely due to the accidents of time, for as the\r\ncartoon was made for the purpose of transferring the leading lines of\r\nthe composition to the wall, Holbein possibly only indicated the main\r\noutlines, leaving the more careful modelling to be done on the wall\r\nitself. Sadly damaged as the cartoon is, a mere fragment of the first\r\nconception of a great masterpiece, it nevertheless remains a remarkable\r\nand precious work of art, doubly valuable in that it not only shows us\r\nHolbein’s methods of work, but is also the only record from his own hand\r\nwe possess to-day in this country of the most important and celebrated\r\npainting he produced while in England. The whole composition is drawn in\r\nwith the point of the brush, in the manner, as Mr. S. Arthur Strong\r\npoints out, at once broad and minute, of which Holbein seems to have\r\nbeen the solitary master. In this crowd of particulars almost everyone\r\nelse would have lost sight of the whole, and given us a map instead of a\r\nview.[215] Mr. Roger E. Fry speaks of it as one of Holbein’s greatest\r\ncreations. “It has all the grandeur of style, the lucidity and ease of\r\narrangement of the greatest monumental design of Italy, together with a\r\nparticularity and minuteness which would seem incompatible with those\r\ngreater qualities of style had they not been thus wonderfully united. In\r\nall the decorative details, too, this great work gives us a measure of\r\nHolbein’s impeccable taste at a time when taste was by no means as\r\nuniversal as it had been in earlier centuries.”[216]\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  S.

This is not only evident from its\r\nagreement with Van Leemput’s copy, but also from its dimensions. It is\r\nlife-size, and thus considerably bigger than any other preliminary\r\nportrait-study by Holbein which has survived. It is in black and red\r\nchalks, on paper prepared with body-colour in the manner practised by\r\nthe painter at that period. The study is of the face alone, part of the\r\nhat, the collar, and a small portion of fur on the shoulders being\r\nroughly indicated. The short, scanty beard and the still scantier\r\nwhiskers do not conceal the shape of the massive, almost square face,\r\nwith its thin eyebrows, fat, heavy cheeks, which from their size make\r\nthe mouth look small. He gazes in front of him, his eyes unconscious of\r\nthe spectator, as though the thoughts of the sitter were entirely given\r\nto himself. The modelling is masterly, and is obtained by the simplest\r\nmeans; but the sketch, simple as it appears to be, produces a wonderful\r\neffect of perfect truth to life. Here is the King exactly as he was, as\r\nnone other but Holbein could have drawn him. He has given not only an\r\nabsolutely faithful rendering of the face itself, but has laid bare much\r\nof the complex character which lurked behind it, and the drawing must\r\nalways remain both one of the artist’s very finest portrait-studies and\r\nalso a living document of the utmost value in the history of Tudor\r\nEngland. How this drawing came to be in Munich is not known. It was\r\ndiscovered among a number of other drawings, put aside as of no\r\nparticular value, by Herr J. H. von Hefner-Alteneck when he was keeper\r\nof the Print Room. It does not appear to have ever formed a part of the\r\nWindsor series of drawings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 221.

Pollard, _Henry VIII_, p. 220.\r\n\r\nThe Whitehall painting became the prototype of nine-tenths of the very\r\nnumerous portraits of Henry which were produced during his reign and for\r\nsome little time afterwards. With one possible exception, these works\r\nare not from Holbein’s own hand; they were all the work of the less\r\nimportant artists attached to the English court. These, again, are of\r\nvery varying degrees of skill, some being but coarse and common\r\nproductions, while others have considerable artistic merits. There is\r\ngreat probability that some of the best of them were from the workshop\r\nof Gerard and Lucas Hornebolt, more particularly those half-lengths of\r\nwhich the portrait in Warwick Castle is perhaps the finest example. All,\r\nhowever, had their real origin in the Whitehall painting; in every one\r\nof them the King is shown full-face, and in the same characteristic\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OTHER PORTRAITS OF THE KING]\r\n\r\nInteresting as the subject is, the scope of this book does not permit\r\nany attempt to describe, or even to compile a list of, all the portraits\r\nof Henry VIII still remaining in England. A few of the principal ones\r\nmay be mentioned briefly. Several of them are full-lengths. Among these\r\none of the most interesting is in Belvoir Castle.[219] It was purchased\r\nby the fourth Duke of Rutland at Lord Torrington’s sale in 1787 for\r\n£211. Except in some minor details of the dress, it follows the\r\nWhitehall painting very closely. The King is wearing “white hose, with\r\nthe Garter on his left leg; a gold chain round his neck with the letter\r\nH, with a pendant circular gold case without any device; another gold\r\nchain or collar across the shoulder over the surcoat is mounted in\r\njewels set in gold-and-enamel. The whole of the dress and ornaments is\r\nmost elaborately painted and gilded, and in excellent effect of light\r\nand colour, being in an absolutely perfect state of preservation.”[220]\r\nThe copyist has made the face younger and more handsome, and much more\r\nlacking in expression than the Munich sketch. The background is a\r\ncurtain with an elaborate design in panels, each one surmounted by a\r\ncrown. Dr. Waagen thought it to be a genuine work by Holbein. “Although\r\npainted on canvas,” he says, “the picture is of such truth, delicacy,\r\nand transparency, that I consider it an original.” A similar\r\nwhole-length on wood, belonging to the Seymour family, is described by\r\nDr. Woltmann, who regarded it as an excellently painted contemporary\r\ncopy, which very possibly came into the possession of that family\r\nthrough their connection with Jane Seymour.[221] There is a far finer\r\nexample at Petworth, much more transparent and delicate in its tones,\r\nwhich Wornum describes as “really magnificent.”[222] This work is by no\r\nmeans an exact copy; it differs in various details, more particularly in\r\nthe dress, which is of silver brocade with a blue mantle lined with\r\nermine. It is possibly the work of a Fleming. The background is\r\narchitectural. There is another full-length version at St. Bartholomew’s\r\nHospital, with a further variation of the background and the floor.\r\nOther repetitions are at Chatsworth,[223] Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\nand in the possession of Viscount Dillon at Ditchley, Enstone.[224]\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in _The Connoisseur_, vol. vi.

The artist, whoever he was, had a manner of his own, and was\r\n  more than a mere copyist. The cold grey scheme of colour is a contrast\r\n  to the depth and richness at which Holbein aimed, and is more akin to\r\n  what we afterwards appreciate as characteristic in Honthorst and\r\n  Mytens.”—_Critical Studies and Fragments_, p. 91. The figure is\r\n  evidently copied directly from the wall-painting. The position and the\r\n  details of the dress agree exactly with the Hardwick cartoon. It is\r\n  reproduced by Dr. Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 181.\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by A. F. Pollard, _Henry VIII_, p. 150.\r\n\r\nThe half-length and three-quarter-length versions, of which the\r\nportraits at Rome and in Warwick Castle are, perhaps, the most\r\nimportant, are still more numerous. In these the King is shown in the\r\nsame position, and apparently several years older, the cheeks fatter and\r\nmore shapeless, and with greyer beard, while in a number of them,\r\ninstead of holding his dagger, he has a stick in his left hand. The\r\nWarwick picture, which is life-size, to the knees, and full-front, was\r\nconsidered by Dr. Waagen to be a genuine work by Holbein of about the\r\ndate 1530, but more recent criticism has shown him to be wrong in both\r\nthese assertions. “The square face is so fat,” he says, “that the\r\nseveral parts are quite indistinct. There is in these features a brutal\r\negotism, an obstinacy, and a harshness of feeling, such as I have never\r\nyet seen in any human countenance. In the eyes, too, there is the\r\nsuspicious watchfulness of a wild beast, so that I became quite\r\nuncomfortable from looking at it a long time; for the picture, a\r\nmasterpiece of Holbein, is as true in the smallest details as if the\r\nking himself stood before you. In the very splendid dress much gold is\r\nemployed. The under-sleeves are of gold, with brown shadows; the hands\r\nmost strikingly true to nature; in the left he has a cane, and in the\r\nright a pair of gloves; on his head a small cap. The background is\r\nbright green. The want of simplicity of the forms, the little rounding\r\nof the whole, notwithstanding the wonderful modelling of all the\r\ndetails, the brownish red local tone of the flesh, the grey of the\r\nshadows, and the very light general effect, show this picture to be a\r\ntransition from the second to the third manner of Holbein, and that it\r\nmay have been painted about 1530.”[225]\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  Waagen, _Treasures of Art in Great Britain_, iii. p. 215.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, impossible that the portrait can have been painted in\r\nthat year, when Henry was not forty. He appears to be at least fifteen\r\nyears older than this. The head and hands are good, but the style of\r\npainting has little in common with that of Holbein, while the details of\r\nthe dress lack the beauty, delicacy, and truth of draughtsmanship which\r\nare to be found in his work. There is a portrait in the collection of\r\nthe Marquis of Bute, which, according to Dr. Waagen, is “exactly like\r\nthe picture by Holbein at Warwick Castle, only less finished.”[226] When\r\nhe saw it, as far back as 1854, it was ascribed to “Gerard Horebout,”\r\nand there is every probability that this attribution is the correct one,\r\nfor it is not to be expected that the almost forgotten name of Hornebolt\r\nwould have been substituted for the much better known one of Holbein,\r\nand the fact that the former name has clung to the picture for so long\r\nis strong evidence in favour of the contention that Hornebolt was the\r\npainter of it. For this reason the Warwick portrait, and others like it,\r\nare now tentatively attributed by most modern writers to the workshop of\r\nGerard and Luke Hornebolt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, vol. iii. p. 482.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 19\r\n  HENRY VIII\r\n  NATIONAL GALLERY, ROME\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF HENRY VIII AT ROME]\r\n\r\nThe portrait in the National Gallery, Rome (Pl. 19),[227] which was\r\nformerly in the Corsini Collection, is a three-quarter length, and is\r\ninscribed across the plain background, on either side of the head, “ANNO\r\n· ÆTATIS · SVÆ · XLIX,” and was, therefore, painted in 1539 or 1540. In\r\ndress and position it closely follows Van Leemput’s copy, and the\r\nWindsor and other versions, in which the left hand holds the\r\ndagger-cord. With the exception of the substitution of brown fur for\r\nermine, and different embroidery on the upper sleeves, the Rome and the\r\nWindsor portraits are in exact agreement as to the costume. The face in\r\nthe Rome portrait is decidedly younger than in the Warwick and Windsor\r\nversions, as the date would indicate, so that it is possibly one of the\r\nearliest of the contemporary copies, taken directly from the\r\nwall-painting under Holbein’s own supervision. It is undoubtedly the\r\nbest of the later portraits of the King, the face being full of\r\ncharacter finely rendered, and it is regarded by a number of modern\r\ncritics, including Dr. Ganz, as a work from Holbein’s own brush.\r\n\r\nFootnote 227:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 125.\r\n\r\nAn important example of this type of the portraits of Henry VIII is the\r\nthree-quarter length belonging to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London,\r\nwhich was last exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1909 (No.\r\n23). The dress is very similar to the Warwick portrait. The King is\r\ngrasping in his left hand a black staff mounted in gold. The background\r\nis dark, and on it is inscribed: “ANNO [~D][~N]I 1544. ÆTATIS SVÆ 55,”\r\nwhich is incorrect, as Henry did not enter his fifty-fifth year until\r\n1545.[228] The portrait in Windsor Castle,[229] which, as Mr. Ernest Law\r\npoints out, is the only contemporary likeness of Henry in the whole of\r\nthe royal collections which has anything of an Holbeinesque character,\r\nwas evidently copied from the Whitehall fresco. In the attitude and in\r\nthe details of the dress it follows the original with considerable\r\ncloseness, though slight differences are to be noted, as in the position\r\nof the right hand, which is here placed over the sword-belt, instead of\r\nbelow it as in Van Leemput’s copy. Its agreement with the Rome portrait\r\nhas been already pointed out. The face, however, more closely resembles\r\nthe Warwick portrait. Mr. Ernest Law suggests that it was executed\r\nseveral years later than the Holbein prototype, by some pupil or\r\nimitator, such as Guillim Stretes, after the master’s death,[230] the\r\ngeneral attitude, pose, dress, and accessories of the original being\r\ncarefully adhered to, but the features modified, and the beard shown as\r\nthinner and turning grey, to suit his added years, though in outline\r\nthey still closely resemble Holbein’s drawing at Munich. The size of the\r\npanel is 3 ft. 3¾ in. high × 2 ft. 5½ in. wide. It may be the picture\r\nwhich was No. 866 in James II’s catalogue: “King Henry VIII at\r\nhalf-length, with gloves in his right hand”; though this description\r\nsuits equally well the smaller portrait (18 in. × 16 in.) at Hampton\r\nCourt, No. 606.\r\n\r\nFootnote 228:\r\n\r\n  There is another version of this portrait with the black staff in the\r\n  left hand at Chatsworth, in which, Mr. S. Arthur Strong says, “the\r\n  drawing of the features is masterly, and the detail is minute and\r\n  searching without being petty; but here again the effect is flat, and\r\n  we feel that Holbein himself would have better conveyed the sense of\r\n  roundness and depth.... On the whole, there is a French rather than a\r\n  German look about this picture, which suggests the possibility that it\r\n  may have been painted at the time of the Field of the Cloth of\r\n  Gold.”—_Critical Studies and Fragments_, p. 91, and Pl. ix. i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 229:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Law, _Holbein’s Pictures_, &c., Pl. v.; Davies, p. 165;\r\n  Knackfuss, fig. 126; Pollard, _Henry VIII_, frontispiece (in colour);\r\n  Cust, _Royal Collection of Paintings, Windsor Castle_, Pl. 49; Ganz,\r\n  _Holbein_, p. 222.\r\n\r\nFootnote 230:\r\n\r\n  _Holbein’s Pictures_, &c., p. 13.\r\n\r\nAnother good version of this portrait, with the left hand on the\r\ndagger-cord, is the half-length belonging to the Earl of Yarborough,\r\nwhile an excellent example of the Warwick Castle type, with a cane\r\nsubstituted for the dagger, was lent by Lord Sackville to the Burlington\r\nFine Arts Club in 1909 (No. 21).\r\n\r\nThere is also an excellent portrait of the Warwick type in the\r\ncollection of the Duke of Manchester at Kimbolton Castle.[231] It is on\r\npanel, 35 in. × 25 in., and closely resembles the picture in the\r\nNational Portrait Gallery (No. 496) (35⅛ in. × 26¼ in.), which is\r\nattributed to Luke Hornebolt.[232] The latter had at one time a coat of\r\narms on the frame indicating that it belonged at some period to the\r\nNassau family. It may have been taken over to Holland at the time of the\r\nmarriage of Princess Mary, daughter of Charles I, to William of Orange,\r\nin 1641. There are three other portraits of the King in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery, while other versions or old copies exist at Castle\r\nHoward, and at Serlby, the seat of Viscount Galway. The latter (35 in. ×\r\n27 in.) has an inscription on the background giving the King’s titles\r\nand the date 1547, the year of his death. Another (36 in. × 30 in.), at\r\none time in the collection of Mr. Henry Willett, and now in the Brighton\r\nArt Gallery, is said to have been taken from a wainscot in King’s Walden\r\nHouse, Herts, formerly the residence of Anne Boleyn.\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:\r\n\r\n  Tudor Exhibition, 1890, No. 97, and reproduced in the Catalogue, p.\r\n  48.\r\n\r\nFootnote 232:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in Mr. Cust’s illustrated Catalogue of _National Portrait\r\n  Gallery_, vol. i. p. 23.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “HENRY VIII WITH A SCROLL”]\r\n\r\nAll these portraits, whether by the Hornebolts or less important\r\ncopyists attached to Henry’s court, are based on Holbein’s Whitehall\r\npainting. There is, however, one other representation of Henry VIII, of\r\nabout the date of Holbein’s first entry into the royal service, which is\r\nof a very different character, and was not painted under the influence\r\nof the great German. This is the fine picture at Hampton Court (No. 563\r\n(313)), generally known as “King Henry VIII with a Scroll.”[233] He is\r\nseen at half-length, with head turned slightly to the right, but eyes to\r\nthe front. He has reddish hair, and a small thin beard and moustache,\r\nand his eyes are dark grey. He wears a doublet of cloth of gold, cut\r\nsquare across the chest, covered with strings of pearls, and slashed\r\nwith rows of white puffs, above which his white frilled shirt is seen.\r\nOver this is a sable-furred cloak. His black cap has a medallion, with\r\nfigures of the Virgin and Infant Christ in enamel, and a white jewelled\r\nfeather. In front of him is a table or ledge with a crimson cushion, on\r\nwhich his right hand is placed, and a scroll of white paper, one end of\r\nwhich he holds between the thumb and forefinger of his left. On it is\r\ninscribed a sentence from the Gospel of St. Mark in Roman lettering:\r\n“Marci—16. Ite in Mũdvm Vniversṽ et predicate Evangelivm omni creatvræ.”\r\nThe background is a rich green. It is on panel, 2 ft. 4 in. high × 1 ft.\r\n10 in. wide.\r\n\r\nFootnote 233:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Law, _Royal Gallery at Hampton Court_, p. 204.\r\n\r\nThe probable authorship of this painting has given rise to much\r\ndiscussion and difference of opinion. It has been attributed at\r\ndifferent times to Holbein, Janet, Joos van Cleve, and Girolamo da\r\nTreviso, and even to Toto or Penni. Dr. Woltmann considered it to be the\r\nwork of a Frenchman, whereas Mr. Wornum was inclined to attribute it to\r\nan Italian hand, possibly Da Treviso. The one thing certain about it is\r\nthat it is not by Holbein. There is an equal difference of opinion as to\r\nthe date. The King has so youthful a look, as compared with the Hardwick\r\ncartoon and the Munich drawing, that some writers hold that he cannot\r\nhave been more than thirty-eight—certainly not more than forty—when it\r\nwas painted. This would make the date about 1529, in which year Holbein\r\nwas in Switzerland. On the other hand, there are two facts which point\r\nto a later date—the arrangement of the hair and beard, and the text on\r\nthe scroll, which, taken together, make it highly probable that the\r\nportrait was painted in 1536. It was on the 8th of May 1535 that Henry,\r\nin imitation of Francis I, ordered all about his court to cut their hair\r\nshort and to grow their beards—“the King commanded all about his court\r\nto poll their heads; and to give them example he caused his own head to\r\nbe polled, and from thenceforth his beard to be knotted and no more\r\nshaven.”[234] In the picture both hair and beard are treated in the new\r\nfashion. Again, on October 4th of the same year the printing of\r\nCoverdale’s English version of the whole Bible, for which Holbein\r\ndesigned the title-page, was finished, and in 1536 Henry ordered a copy\r\nof it to be laid in the choir of every church, “for every man that will\r\nto look and read therein; and shall discourage no man from reading any\r\npart of the Bible, but rather comfort, exhort, and admonish every man to\r\nread the same.” To this the text on the scroll which Henry holds in the\r\nportrait clearly refers; and further evidence is supplied by the Bible\r\nfrontispiece, in which the King is shown under a canopy, with a sword in\r\nhis right hand, and a clasped Bible in his left, which he is handing to\r\nhis kneeling bishops. One of the little pictures which form the border\r\nof the title-page, in which our Saviour is exhorting His disciples to\r\npreach the Word throughout the world, has the same text (Mark xvi. 15)\r\ninscribed below it. The evidence, therefore, is very strongly in favour\r\nof the assumption that the portrait was painted to commemorate Henry’s\r\nshare in the publication of Coverdale’s English version of the Bible.\r\nAgainst these two arguments in favour of the date 1536, the compilers of\r\nthe catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition point out that\r\nthe King does not look more than thirty, which would place the portrait\r\nat about the date of the meeting with Francis I at the Field of the\r\nCloth of Gold in 1520. “The portrait of Eleonora of Spain, wife of\r\nFrancis I, also at Hampton Court,” they say, “is evidently by the same\r\nhand; and the smaller portrait of Francis I, also at Hampton Court, is\r\neither by, or a copy after, the same painter. These circumstances would\r\npoint to a possible French origin, and lend some colour to the\r\nascription of the portrait either to “Sotto” Cleef, who worked in France\r\nbefore coming to England, or to Jean Clouet—more probably the latter,\r\nwho may very well have been in attendance on Francis I at the Field of\r\nthe Cloth of Gold.”[235] It is difficult, however, to follow these\r\nwriters in their conclusion that the portrait of Eleonora, almost\r\ncertainly by the elder Clouet, and the portrait of Henry VIII are by the\r\nsame hand, while the fact that in all the earlier portraits of the King\r\nhe is shown with long hair, cut straight across the forehead, and no\r\nbeard, makes it still more difficult to accept the date as that of the\r\nmeeting of the two monarchs in France, unless much stronger evidence as\r\nto its French origin be forthcoming. It is not safe to go farther than\r\nto ascribe it to a Franco-Flemish origin. It should be noted in passing\r\nthat a small point in favour of those who see in it a work by an Italian\r\nhand lies in the scroll or cartellino, a feature not often met with in\r\nFrench or English portraits of that time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 234:\r\n\r\n  Stow’s _Annales_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 235:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition Catalogue_, p.bv 81.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “HENRY VIII WITH A SCROLL”]\r\n\r\nOn the back of the panel is branded Charles I’s cypher, and there is\r\nalso a slip of paper on which is inscribed in contemporary handwriting,\r\n“Changed with my Lord Arundel, 1624.” In Charles’ catalogue, compiled in\r\n1639, it is entered as “King Henry VIII when he was young, with a white\r\nscroll of parchment in his hand; the picture being to the shoulders;\r\nhalf a figure so big as the life, in a carved gilded frame. Length 4 ft.\r\n0. A Whitehall piece, said to be done by Jennet or Sotto Cleve.” It is\r\npossibly the picture in the Commonwealth inventory—“King Henry y^e\r\n8^{th} by Gennett,” which was “sold to M^{r.} Baggeley y^e 23^{rd} Oct.\r\n1651 for £25.” It may also be the “Table with the picture of King Henry\r\nVIII, then being young,” in Edward VI’s catalogue. An early and\r\ninteresting copy of this picture, on canvas, 28¾ in. × 22¼ in., is in\r\nthe possession of the Merchant Taylors’ Company, which was in the Tudor\r\nExhibition, 1890 (No. 120), and the Burlington Club Exhibition, 1909\r\n(No. 24). In the catalogue of the former exhibition it was attributed to\r\nParis Bordone. It was presented to the Company in 1616 by Mr. John\r\nVernon. There is a third version of the picture in the Marquis of\r\nExeter’s collection at Burleigh House, in which the same Latin verse is\r\ninscribed on the scroll. Dr. Waagen says that “it is very carefully\r\npainted in a brownish tone.”[236]\r\n\r\nFootnote 236:\r\n\r\n  Waagen, _Treasures of Art_, &c., iii. p. 407.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Hardwick cartoon and the Munich drawing there is a\r\nthird portrait of Henry existing which can be attributed almost\r\ncertainly to Holbein’s hand. This is the beautiful little panel in Lord\r\nSpencer’s collection at Althorp (_frontispiece_),[237] which measures\r\nonly 10½ in. × 7½ in. It is a half-length, three-quarters to the right.\r\nNo hair is visible under the cap or beside the ears; the hairs of the\r\nclose-cropped fair beard and moustache are drawn with minute care. The\r\neyes are clear blue-grey. He wears a black cap trimmed with jewels and\r\nloops of pearls and a white feather falling to the left. His gown of\r\ncloth of gold is lined with brown fur, over a light grey doublet cut low\r\nat the neck, embroidered with an elaborate pattern in black, trimmed\r\nwith jewels and slashed and puffed with white. The white shirt has a\r\nhigh collar fitting close round the neck, embroidered with a rich design\r\nin gold, and with a very small frill. On his breast is a round jewel\r\nsuspended by a chain of spiral black and gold beads and H’s. The hands\r\nare shown in part, the left at his side, and the right holding a glove.\r\nThe background is a plain bright blue.\r\n\r\nFootnote 237:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 1.

The first impression it gives is that, in\r\nspite of its beauty and brilliance, it yet displays certain differences\r\nfrom Holbein’s usual style which renders its attribution to him not\r\nabsolutely certain; but repeated examination modifies this first\r\nimpression, and it becomes impossible not to agree with such critics as\r\nDr. Woltmann, Mr. Lionel Cust, and Dr. Ganz, who are emphatically of\r\nopinion that Holbein was the author of it. It is impossible, again, to\r\nfind any other painter who could have produced so vivid and striking a\r\nportrait of the King, and so accomplished a work of art. Mr. Roger E.\r\nFry describes it as one of Holbein’s most miraculous pieces of\r\ncraftsmanship. “It is little more in scale than a large miniature, and\r\nHolbein has treated it with all the skill in minute delineation which he\r\nalone possessed, and that without losing for a moment unity of tone and\r\nbreadth of feeling; but, wonderful as it is, it gives one scarcely any\r\nidea of an actual character. Holbein seems never to have read anything\r\nbehind the expansive mask of his royal patron; whether he abstained out\r\nof discretion or failed from want of interest one can but guess.”[238]\r\nAfter examining the Munich head, however, it is difficult to agree with\r\nMr. Fry’s opinion that Holbein saw nothing of Henry’s real character.\r\nThe Althorp panel is almost identical in position and dress with the\r\noriginal cartoon for the Whitehall wall-painting, and it is probable\r\nthat Holbein intended to use it as his model for the latter. It must\r\nhave been painted in 1537, before the wall-painting itself was begun, or\r\nat least before the change in the position of the King’s head was\r\ndecided upon. It may be the portrait which in the inventory of Henry\r\nVIII’s pictures, made at his death, was joined to that of Queen Jane\r\nSeymour in a diptych—“Item, a table like a booke, with the picture of\r\nKynge Henry theight and Quene Jane”; though, if so, the corresponding\r\nportrait of Jane Seymour is lost, for the one of that queen in the\r\nVienna Gallery is much larger than Lord Spencer’s portrait. The latter\r\nwas at South Kensington in 1862 (No. 2651), and again in 1865 (No.\r\n2028), and at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1909 (No. 38).\r\n\r\nFootnote 238:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xv., May 1909, p. 74.\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent contemporary copy of it in the National Portrait\r\nGallery (No. 157),[239] 10¾ in. × 7½ in., on copper, which was purchased\r\nin 1863, and was formerly in the collection of Mr. Barrett, of Lee\r\nPriory, Kent. When in his possession it was engraved in line for\r\nSinger’s edition of Cavendish’s _Life of Wolsey_, 1825. The background\r\nis now very dark, but in the engraving it is shown to be a curtain. This\r\nis the chief point of difference between it and Lord Spencer’s panel.\r\nThere is also a somewhat weak copy of it among the miniatures in the\r\nDuke of Buccleuch’s collection, which, like the original, has no\r\ninscription. It has suffered extensive repairs at some time or other,\r\nand the eyes are now a bright chestnut colour, evidently due to the\r\nignorance of the restorer. Other miniatures of Henry VIII, attributed to\r\nHolbein, are dealt with in a succeeding chapter.[240]\r\n\r\nFootnote 239:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in the illustrated Catalogue, National Portrait Gallery,\r\n  vol. i. p. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 240:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 233-236.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF QUEEN JANE SEYMOUR]\r\n\r\nJane Seymour was the first of Henry’s queens to be painted by Holbein.\r\nThe various portraits of Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn still\r\nexisting are not by him, and it is evident that the artist did not enter\r\nthe royal service until after Anne’s execution on 19th May 1536, and\r\nHenry’s very precipitate marriage with Jane Seymour on the following\r\nday. Portraits of both these ladies are usually ascribed to Holbein by\r\ntheir owners, according to the prevailing fashion of earlier days, when\r\neverything dating from Tudor times was unhesitatingly given to him.\r\nShortly before Holbein’s return to England in 1532, Katherine of Aragon\r\nhad permanently retired from court, and in the seclusion of The Moor,\r\ndeserted by the King, her thoughts fully occupied with her impending\r\ndivorce, it is not likely that she would have any desire to sit for her\r\nportrait, or to command Holbein to visit her for that purpose. There is\r\nmore probability that Anne Boleyn may have been painted by him, but as\r\nno such portrait has been discovered, it must be taken for granted that\r\nhe did not. The head among the Windsor drawings, inscribed “Anna Bollein\r\nQueen,”[241] has been wrongly named, and bears no likeness to the few\r\nportraits which may be said with some degree of certainty to represent\r\nher. Much information respecting the portraits of these two queens will\r\nbe found in the papers read by Mr. John Gough Nichols and Sir George\r\nScharf before the Society of Antiquaries in 1863 and published in\r\n_Archæologia_.[242]\r\n\r\nFootnote 241:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 323; Wornum, ii. 18; Holmes, i. 25. Reproduced by Davies, p.\r\n  214, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  Vol. xl. pt. i. pp. 71-88.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to show that Holbein painted either Katherine’s\r\ndaughter, Mary, or Anne’s daughter, Elizabeth, though here again\r\nportraits of them exist which in less critical days were said to be by\r\nhim. The drawing in the Windsor Collection inscribed “The Lady Mary\r\nafter Queen,”[243] has no claim to represent Queen Mary, nor is there\r\nany known portrait of her which bears any likeness to Holbein’s style of\r\npainting. The Princess Elizabeth was ten years old at the time of the\r\npainter’s death, whereas the youngest portrait of her extant is the very\r\ninteresting one at the age of about fifteen or sixteen in the Royal\r\nCollection,[244] which was included in Charles I’s catalogue as “A\r\nWhitehall piece of Holben,” and said to represent “Queen Elizabeth when\r\nshe was young, to the waist.” This is probably a work of Franco-Flemish\r\norigin, and has nothing to do with Holbein, who, if he had painted her,\r\nmust have shown her as a little girl. Mr. Nichols, in his paper\r\nmentioned above, states that “there can be little doubt that Holbein\r\ndrew the King’s natural son, Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and\r\nSuffolk, who lived until the 22nd July 1536,” but no such portrait or\r\ndrawing of him can be discovered. There is, however, among the Windsor\r\nheads, a drawing of his wife, Mary,[245] daughter of Thomas, third Duke\r\nof Norfolk, and sister of Henry, Earl of Surrey, both of whom sat to\r\nHolbein. It is a fine drawing, but very badly rubbed. She is represented\r\nfull-face, with the eyes cast down, and wearing a close-fitting white\r\ncap or hood, and a large flat black hat with a big ostrich feather. The\r\ndress is powdered with the letter R, which in some cases seems to be\r\nformed of pearls, while the letter M also occurs twice. This fashion of\r\nwearing an initial letter, usually as a pendant ornament, was by no\r\nmeans unusual at that period, and occurs in more than one of Holbein’s\r\nportraits. The drawing of the Duchess is inscribed “The Lady of\r\nRichmond.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 331; Wornum, ii. 39; Holmes, ii. 15.

This is a genuine work of Holbein of very fine quality.\r\nShe is shown almost to the knees, the body and head turned slightly to\r\nthe left, and her hands clasped in front of her. She is dressed in red\r\nvelvet, with hanging sleeves covered with gold embroidery, and\r\nunder-sleeves of lilac-grey watered silk with an elaborate pattern,\r\nworked with seed pearls, and slashed and puffed with white. The cuffs\r\nhave a deep border of wonderfully painted black Spanish work. She wears\r\ntwo heavy necklaces, of jewels and pearls, and a band of similar\r\nornament along the edge of her square-cut bodice, and an ornament at the\r\nbreast composed of the initials I.H.S. and three pendant pearls. Her\r\nhead-dress is of the angular English pattern. The inner cap, which\r\ncompletely hides her hair, is of brown silk with a black stripe, and the\r\njewelled band or framework is of the same pattern as the border of the\r\ndress. The body of the head-dress is cloth of gold, with the customary\r\nblack fall. The background is of dark grey-blue without inscription. The\r\ncolour scheme is rich and harmonious, but delicate and pearly in tone,\r\nand a considerable amount of gold has been used in the painting of the\r\njewels, and the gold tissue and embroidery of the cap. Once again the\r\nextraordinarily fine painting of the hands has to be recorded; they are\r\nfull of expression and character. There is less expression in the face.\r\nShe has no great pretensions to beauty, and her complexion is pale, thus\r\nagreeing with all contemporary accounts of her appearance. In a\r\nsingularly frank letter from Chapuys to Antoine Perrenot, dated London,\r\n18th May 1536, which was intended for the Emperor’s ears, the Spanish\r\nambassador says: “She is sister to one Edward Semel, of middle stature,\r\nand no great beauty, so fair that one would call her rather pale than\r\notherwise.... The said Semel is not a woman of great wit, but she may\r\nhave good understanding. It is said she inclines to be proud and\r\nhaughty. She bears great love and reverence to the Princess (_i.e._\r\nMary). I know not if honors will make her change hereafter.”[247] He\r\nthen proceeds to throw doubts upon the lady’s virtue, and to speak in\r\ncoarse innuendo of Henry’s matrimonial ventures. The panel, which is\r\nprobably the one which was in the Arundel Collection, measures 65 cm. by\r\n48 cm., and is of the same size as the portrait of Dr. John Chamber;\r\nthey are the largest of Holbein’s works in the Vienna Gallery. This\r\nportrait was evidently the one seen by Van Mander in Amsterdam in 1604.\r\nHe says: “There was, at Amsterdam, in the Warmoesstraat, a portrait of a\r\nQueen of England, admirably executed, and very pretty and nice; she was\r\nattired in silver brocade, which appears to be genuine silver with some\r\nadmixture, and it was depicted so transparently, curiously, and\r\nexquisitely, that a white foil seemed to lie beneath.”[248]\r\n\r\nFootnote 246:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 252.

Several replicas of the picture still remain in England,\r\nthe two best of which, excellent contemporary copies, are in the Duke of\r\nBedford’s collection at Woburn Abbey, and in that of Lord Sackville at\r\nKnole. The latter was in the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No. 44), and the\r\nBurlington Fine Arts Club, 1909 (No. 46). Another version is in the\r\npossession of the Duke of Northumberland. Hollar made an admirable\r\nengraving from the Arundel version, a small circle dated 1648 (Parthey\r\n1427); and there is at Windsor, as already noted, a miniature painted\r\nfrom it by Nicholas Hilliard, which is inscribed “ANŌ DNĪ 1536 ÆTATIS\r\nSVÆ 27.”[250] Hilliard, no doubt, found this inscription on the original\r\nfrom which he worked, but nothing of the kind is now discernible either\r\non the picture in Vienna or Lord Sackville’s version. It may, however,\r\nhave been taken from one of the numerous miniatures of this Queen, dealt\r\nwith in a later chapter.[251] This inscription is valuable as giving the\r\nprobable date at which Holbein painted the Queen, and proves that he was\r\nin the royal service as early as in the summer of 1536. Very probably\r\nthe portrait was afterwards used by him as the basis for the head and\r\nposition of Jane in the Whitehall wall-painting. There is an excellent\r\nold copy of the portrait in the Hague Gallery (No. 278) which shows\r\nslight differences.[252]\r\n\r\nFootnote 249:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 325; Wornum, ii. 22; Holmes, i. 1.

The\r\nfinished drawing is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and there is\r\nanother version of it in the British Museum. It is the most important of\r\nHolbein’s designs for goldsmith’s work which has been preserved, and is\r\ndescribed in a later chapter.[253] Henry VIII appears to have been\r\ngenuinely devoted to his third wife, but his happiness was short-lived,\r\nfor she died on October 24, 1537, twelve days after the birth of her\r\nson, Edward VI, her death being due to carelessness on the part of her\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nFootnote 253:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 274-275.\r\n\r\nNot a single dated portrait of the year 1537 remains, nor is there one\r\nwhich can be ascribed with any certainty to this year.

Henry’s ambassadors and agents were\r\ninstructed to make discreet inquiries as to suitable candidates, and\r\nbefore the close of the year a number of names had been submitted to him\r\nfor his consideration. In spite of this unseemly expedition, however,\r\nnearly two years were to elapse before the final choice was made, for it\r\nwas not until the very end of 1539 that Anne of Cleves came to England\r\nas Henry’s fourth queen. Throughout the whole of 1538 marriage\r\nnegotiations, which in the end proved fruitless, were carried on\r\nsimultaneously with Francis I and the Emperor Charles V. Though Henry\r\nwas anxious to marry again, in order that the succession, which rested\r\non the precarious life of one infant Prince, might be made more assured,\r\nyet his search for a bride both in France and in Imperial circles at one\r\nand the same time was undertaken quite as much for political as for\r\nmatrimonial reasons. It was his main object at that time to prevent any\r\nclose understanding between his two rivals. With Charles and Francis\r\nunited, and Europe at peace, there was nothing to prevent a coalition\r\nagainst England and an enforcement of the papal excommunication of Henry\r\nby force of arms. By playing off one monarch against the other with the\r\nbait of a proffered matrimonial alliance he hoped to keep the two apart,\r\nand by such means ensure the security of his throne, and be at liberty\r\nto continue the severe methods by which he sought to maintain his\r\nsupremacy as self-appointed head of the English Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SEARCH FOR A FOURTH QUEEN]\r\n\r\nIn the course of these negotiations quite a number of ladies were\r\nsuggested, and in most, if not in all, cases, portraits of them were\r\nprocured for Henry’s inspection. In some instances he sent his own\r\npainter for the purpose; in others, what may be termed “official”\r\nportraits, painted by foreigners, were forwarded to England by his\r\nambassadors abroad. Of these portraits, two—those of the Duchess of\r\nMilan and of the Princess Anne of Cleves—were painted by Holbein, who\r\nwas despatched to Brussels and to Düren in order to take their\r\nlikenesses; but the authorship of the others is less certain, and as the\r\nportraits themselves cannot now be traced, it is difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to arrive at any final conclusion respecting them. There is\r\nmuch probability, however, amounting in two instances almost to\r\ncertainty, that Holbein made other special journeys, in addition to the\r\ntwo just mentioned, for the purpose of painting ladies who had been\r\nreported to the King as beautiful or desirable. These journeys were to\r\nFrance, and solve, in the writer’s opinion, the mysterious journey to\r\nUpper Burgundy; but as the negotiations for a French marriage were\r\nrunning concurrently with those for the hand of the Duchess of Milan, it\r\nwill be better, in order to avoid confusion, to deal separately with\r\neach of these proposed alliances, and the various portraits to which\r\nthey gave rise. For this reason the present chapter is concerned with\r\nHolbein’s painting of the Duchess, while in the following one evidence\r\nis brought forward which indicates that he also received orders from the\r\nKing to take the likenesses of several high-born ladies of France.\r\n\r\nShortly after the imposing funeral ceremonies of Queen Jane Seymour,\r\nCromwell wrote to John Hutton, the English agent in Brussels at the\r\ncourt of the Regent of the Netherlands, Queen Mary of Hungary, the\r\nEmperor’s sister, to ask him to make secret inquiries as to suitable\r\nbrides for the King, and in Hutton’s reply, dated December 4, 1537,\r\noccurs the first mention of the Duchess of Milan as a possible Queen of\r\nEngland. Hutton wrote:\r\n\r\n    “Uppon the recept of your letters addressid unto me by this\r\n    berrar, I have made as myche secret sherche as the tyme wold\r\n    permyt. The which, albeit had byn of lengar contenewance, I cold\r\n    not perceve that anny sherche cold have found wone soo notable a\r\n    personage as were meit to be lykynd to that noble Raynge. In the\r\n    Court ther is wayttyng uppon the Queyn a lady of thage of 14\r\n    yerres, daughtar unto the Lord of Breidrood, of a goodly\r\n    statwre. She is noted varteos, sadde, and womanly; hir beautie\r\n    is competent, hir mother is departid this world, who was\r\n    daughter to the Cardynall of Luikes sister. It is thought that\r\n    the said Cardinall wold give a good dote to have hir bestoid\r\n    after his mynd. Ther is a widdowe, the wiche also repayrithe\r\n    offten to the Court, beyng of goodly personage. She was the\r\n    wyffe of the late Yerle of Egmond, and, as I ame inffarmyd, she\r\n    parsithe fortie yeres of age, the wich dothe not apeire in my\r\n    judgement by hir face. Ther is the Duches of Myllayn, whom I\r\n    have not seyn, but as it is reportid to be a goodly personage\r\n    and of excellent beawtie. The Dewke of Clevis hathe a daughter,\r\n    but I here no great preas neyther of hir personage nor beawtie.\r\n    I have not myche exsperiens emonges ladies, and therfore this\r\n    commission is to me very hard; soo that, yf in anny thyng I\r\n    offend, I beseche your Lordshipe to be my mean for pardon. I\r\n    have wryttyn the treuthe, as nighe as I canne possible lerne,\r\n    levyng the further judgment to other, that are better skillid in\r\n    such matters.”[254]\r\n\r\nFootnote 254:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xii. pt. ii. 1172. _St. P._, viii. 5.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Duchess reached Brussels shortly after this letter was despatched,\r\nand Hutton wrote again to Cromwell on the 9th of December, after a\r\npersonal inspection of the lady, whom he thought to be very like Mrs.\r\nShelton, one of Anne Boleyn’s ladies, as follows:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HUTTON’S LETTERS ABOUT THE DUCHESS]\r\n\r\n    “The Duches of Myllan ... arived here as ystarday, very\r\n    honorably acompenyd as well of hyr owen treyn as withe suche\r\n    that departed from hence to meit hyr.

Christina of\r\nDenmark, youngest daughter of King Christian II of Denmark and Isabella\r\nof Hungary, sister of Charles V, was born in 1523, and had been married,\r\nin 1534, when only eleven years of age, to Francesco Maria Sforza, the\r\nlast Duke of Milan, who died in the following year, October 24, 1535.\r\nShe was now in her sixteenth year, and as the niece of the Emperor, a\r\nmarriage with her, so Henry and his Council considered, would be of\r\ngreat political advantage, as it would give the world a proof that his\r\nquarrel with Charles over the divorce of Katherine of Aragon was at an\r\nend. Henry, therefore, wrote on January 22, 1538, to Sir Thomas Wyat,\r\nhis ambassador in Spain, ordering him to suggest the marriage to the\r\nEmperor, who in his reply, sent through his representative in London,\r\nEustace Chapuys, declared that he would be glad to treat of it. Henry,\r\nwho naturally wished to see the lady, if possible, before committing\r\nhimself too far, began to throw out suggestions that she should be\r\nbrought to Calais, in order that he might make her acquaintance, but\r\nthis proposal was displeasing to the other parties concerned; and so, as\r\nthe next best thing, it was determined to obtain her portrait. Hutton\r\nwas instructed to procure one if he possibly could, and he wrote to\r\nCromwell on February 21, describing a dinner-party he had attended given\r\nby the “Ladie Marqueis of Barrough,” at which she promised to show him,\r\nwhen finished, a portrait for which the Duchess of Milan was sitting,\r\nand for the purpose of which she had put off her mourning dress. This\r\npicture, apparently, was to be given to the Lady Marquis. He told\r\nCromwell:\r\n\r\n    “The Lady Marqueis demaundid of me, yff the letters, wiche I had\r\n    delyverid the Queyn, cam from the Kynges Highnes my master. Unto\r\n    wiche I made answar that the cam frome the Empror. Then she said\r\n    that when she sawe me delyver them, hir hart rejoissid, thynkyng\r\n    ther had byne some good newis consarnyng the Duches of Myllain,\r\n    of whom she made great preis, as well for hir beawtie, favor,\r\n    wisdom, as for hir myche gentilnes. All wiche saynges I\r\n    affirmyd. Withe that she said, yf I had seyn hir owt of hir\r\n    mornyng aparell, so gorgeosly as she had seyn hir the day\r\n    beffore, I wold have marveillid, for she said, to tell me in\r\n    secret, she cawssid hir pikture to be made, wiche beyng\r\n    fenisshed, the Duches had promissid to give it unto hir, soo\r\n    that she of hir owen motion said, assone as it cam to hir handes\r\n    I shuld have a sight therof.”[258]\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 326. _St. P._, viii. 14.\r\n\r\nHe goes on to describe an interview with the Duchess on the following\r\nday, in which she complained of the rain, telling Hutton, “This wether\r\nlikythe not the Queyn, for She is therby pynnyd upp, that She cannot\r\nride abrode to hunt. Then I demandid if Hir Grace did not love huntyng.\r\nShe answered, ‘Non better,’ and soo pawssid.\r\n\r\n    “She spekithe French, and semythe to be of fewe wordes. In hir\r\n    spekyng she lispithe, wiche dothe nothyng mysbecom hir. I canot\r\n    in anny thyng perceve, but she shuldbe off myche sobreness, and\r\n    very wisse and no les gentill.

His zeal for the Reformation commended him to Henry VIII and\r\nCromwell, by whom he was constantly employed from 1538 onwards in\r\ndiplomatic services at the courts of Spain and Portugal, and on special\r\nmissions elsewhere. He was one of the gentlemen ushers of the King’s\r\nPrivy Chamber, and took part in the siege of Boulogne, being rewarded\r\nwith knighthood immediately after the conquest of that town in the\r\nautumn of 1544. He was made Master of the Ordnance and admitted to the\r\nPrivy Council in 1552, and died in 1558. From his correspondence he\r\nappears to have been a man of culture and refinement. Holbein made two,\r\nif not three, journeys abroad in his company, and painted his portrait,\r\nthough its whereabouts is not now known, but the drawing for it, in\r\nwhich he is shown with a scanty beard and long thin moustache, is in the\r\nWindsor Collection.[260]\r\n\r\nFootnote 260:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 302; Wornum, ii. 7; Holmes, i. 40.\r\n\r\nCromwell’s instructions to Hoby were as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Instructions given by the L. Cromwell to Philip Hoby sent over\r\n    by him to the duchess of Lorraine then [to the] duchess of\r\n    Milan.\r\n\r\n    “To repair to Mr. Hutton and tarry secretly at his lodging until\r\n    he shall have been with the Regent. Then upon Hutton’s\r\n    advertisement to go to the Duchess, present Cromwell’s\r\n    commendations and say that no doubt she had heard from the Lady\r\n    Regent and by the relation of the King’s ambassador there, the\r\n    cause of his coming and Cromwell’s inclination to the\r\n    advancement of the same as is declared ‘in the letter.’ He shall\r\n    then beg her to take the pain to sit that a servant of the King,\r\n    who is come thither for that purpose, may take her physiognomy;\r\n    and shall ask when Mr. Hanns shall come to her to do so. The\r\n    said Philip shall as of himself express a wish that both for my\r\n    Lord’s reports of her virtues and for his own view of them, it\r\n    might please the King, being now without a wife, to advance her\r\n    to the honour of a queen of England. ‘And he shall well note her\r\n    answers, her gesture and countenance with her inclination, that\r\n    he may at his return declare the same to the King’s Majesty.’\r\n    Her picture taken, he and Hanns shall return immediately.”[261]\r\n    Hoby was also supplied with a second document, in which all that\r\n    he was to say to the Duchess was carefully drawn up for his\r\n    guidance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 261:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 380(2).\r\n\r\nIn the heading to these instructions, which is written in a later hand\r\nthan the body of the document, the words “to the” in square brackets\r\nhave been inserted by the editor of the _Calendars of Letters and\r\nPapers, &c._ In doing this he has been misled by a very similar set of\r\ninstructions issued to Hoby on the eve of a mission to Lorraine in\r\nAugust of the same year, which is dealt with in the next chapter. He\r\nthus reads the heading as indicating that Hoby was to go first of all to\r\nthe Duchess of Lorraine and afterwards to the Duchess of Milan, and that\r\nthe one set of instructions was to serve for the two visits. The\r\ninserted words, “to the,” however, are not needed. Christina, a few\r\nyears after Holbein painted her, married, in 1540, François, Duke of Bar\r\nand Lorraine, and the writer who added the heading to the copy of Hoby’s\r\ninstructions quite correctly describes her as the Duchess of Lorraine,\r\n“then (or “at that time,” _i.e._ at the time of Hoby’s journey to\r\nBrussels) Duchess of Milan.” This is a small point, but it is necessary\r\nto draw attention to it, as it has to do with Holbein’s subsequent\r\njourney to Upper Burgundy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOBY AND HOLBEIN IN BRUSSELS]\r\n\r\nThe two travellers left London on the 2nd or 3rd of March, and reached\r\nBrussels on the evening of the 10th. The next day was spent in\r\npreliminary interviews, Hutton having audience with the Lady Regent and\r\nthe Duchess in the morning, and Hoby delivering his message to the\r\nlatter in the afternoon. All going smoothly, Holbein was fetched to the\r\ncourt at one o’clock on the 12th, and accomplished all that he had to do\r\nwithin three hours, to the great admiration of Hutton, who considered\r\nthat he showed himself to be a master, and that the likeness was very\r\nperfect. The English agent, the day before their arrival, had already\r\ndespatched a portrait of the lady to London—in all probability the one\r\npromised him by the Lady Marquis—but after seeing Holbein’s beautiful\r\ndrawing, he sent a messenger post haste to stop the bearer of the first\r\npicture, which he now regarded as but “slobbered” in comparison with the\r\nother. Hoby and Holbein, who started upon their homeward journey on the\r\nevening of the 12th, appear to have taken this inferior picture with\r\nthem, so that Cromwell might compare the two. There is no evidence to\r\nindicate by whom it was painted, but as the lady was represented in gay\r\napparel, it must have been in marked contrast to Holbein’s study and the\r\nfull-length portrait he afterwards painted, representing her in her\r\nItalian widow’s weeds. It is possible that this picture is still in\r\nexistence in England, and its discovery would be most interesting.\r\n\r\nHutton’s letter to Cromwell, describing all that took place on the\r\noccasion, is a long one, but as it is one of the few important documents\r\nstill existing in which Holbein is mentioned by name, it cannot well be\r\nomitted here. It is dated March 14, 1538, and runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    “My moste bounden duetie remembered unto Your good Lordshipe.\r\n    Pleasithe the same to be advertissid, that the 10th of this\r\n    present monethe in the evenyng arivid here your Lordshipis\r\n    sarvand Phillip Hobbie, acompenied with a sarvand of the Kynges\r\n    Majesties namyd Mr Haunce, by wiche Phillip I recevyd your\r\n    Lordshippis letter, beryng date at Saynct Jamys the second day\r\n    of this present. Theffect wherof apercevyd, havyng the day\r\n    beffore sent wone of my sarvandes towardes youre Lordshipe withe\r\n    a picture of the Duches of Myllain, I thought it very nessisarie\r\n    to stey the same, for that in my openion it was not soo\r\n    perffight as the cawsse requyrid, neyther as the said Mr Haunce\r\n    coold make it. Uppon wiche determination I dispached another of\r\n    my sarvandes, in post, to returne the same, wiche your Lordshipe\r\n    shall receve by this berrar. The next mornyng aftre the arivall\r\n    of your Lordshippis said sarvand, I did adresse my selff unto\r\n    the Lady Regent, declaryng unto Hir that the night past ther\r\n    arivid at my lodgyng a sarvand of your Lordshippis, withe wone\r\n    other of the Kynges Majesties; by wiche your Lordshippis sarvand\r\n    I had recevyd commiscion to sartiffie Hir Grace that thEmprors\r\n    Ambassadors, resident with the Kynges Majestie my master, had\r\n    made ernyst overture unto your Lordshipe for a marriage to be\r\n    treatid betwixt the Majestie of my said master, and the Duches\r\n    Grace of Millain. To the wiche albeit your Lordshipe was of no\r\n    les good inclination for the furtherance of the same, then the\r\n    said Ambassadors were, yet your Lordshipe thought it not\r\n    exspedient to be broken unto the Kynges Highnes, withowt havyng\r\n    some further occation mynistrid for the openyng of the same. And\r\n    for as myche as your Lordshipe had hard great commendation of\r\n    the furme, beawtie, wisdom, and other verteos qualiteis, the\r\n    wiche God had indewid the said Duches with, you cold perceve no\r\n    mean more meit for the advauncement of the same, than to procure\r\n    her perffight pictur; for wiche your Lordshipe had sent, in\r\n    compeny of your said sarvand, a man very excellent in makyng off\r\n    phisanymies; soo that your Lordshippis desire was that your said\r\n    sarvand myght in moste humbleist wisse salute the Duches Grace,\r\n    requyryng that hir pleisur might be to apoynt the tyme and\r\n    place, wher the said paynter might acomplische his charge. The\r\n    Regent, when I began to declare this forsaid purpos, stud uppon\r\n    hir feit; but, aftre She had a littill ynclyng to what effect\r\n    the same wold com, She did sit dowen, not movyng, till I had\r\n    fenisshid all that I had to say, and then answered as foloythe:\r\n    ‘I thanke yow for your good newis. This is not the first report\r\n    that I have had of the good inclination that the Lord Crumwell\r\n    hathe to thEmprores afferris, for recompence wheroff I trust he\r\n    shall not fynd Us ingrat. And as to his desire in this behalff,\r\n    it shall gladly be accomplisshid.’ Then I said, ‘Madam, I have\r\n    yet further commiscion, wiche is to sartiffie the same unto the\r\n    Duches Grace.’ Hir answar was, that She wold goo to Councell,\r\n    and when the Duches cam to hir oratorie, I myght [have] very\r\n    good oportunitie to talke withe hir. Withe that the Regent\r\n    departid towardes the Councell Chamber, and I taried the Duches\r\n    commyng; who beying com to hir oratorie, wher as remenyd no moo\r\n    but two of hir ladeis, I sartiffied Hir Grace the woll effect of\r\n    your Lordshippis commission consarnyng Phelipe Hobbie, whom,\r\n    when Hir Grace wold give awdiens, wold more ample sartiffie your\r\n    Lordshippis pleisur. She made answar that, if ever it shuld ly\r\n    in hir powar, the good will of your Lordshipe shoid towardes\r\n    hir, wiche she in no part had desarvid, shuld not remeyn\r\n    unrecompencesid; and that as to your said request it was not to\r\n    be denyed, albeit that she, beying ther withe the Queyn hir\r\n    awnt, thought it not meit to make anny graunt therunto withowt\r\n    hir consent, wiche she wold move to obteyn at the first\r\n    convenient leisar, that she myght have with the Queyn consarnyng\r\n    the same.

The same night Phillipe tooke his leve of the\r\n    Duches. I inffurmyd the Lady Regent that the said Phillipe wold\r\n    gladly, accordyng to your Lordshippis commandment, have com to\r\n    have done his duetie unto Hir, to have knowen what further\r\n    sarvis Hir Grace wold commaund hym; but dowttyng he should be\r\n    notid, wherby myght be discoverid that wiche till then was kept\r\n    secret as coldbe.

Cromwell asks that the man be allowed to see and\r\ntalk with my said niece, and take her portrait in order to show it to\r\nthe King and give him greater desire to see her. This I have allowed,\r\nand the man has actually returned to England with the portrait, well\r\nsatisfied with the personal appearance and manners of my said niece, who\r\nhas not failed on the occasion to thank Cromwell for his offers and show\r\nof affection.”[263]\r\n\r\nFootnote 263:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 419. _Spanish Calendar_, vol. v. pt. ii.\r\n  217.\r\n\r\nFrom Chapuys’ reply to her, dated March 23, we learn that Hoby and\r\nHolbein reached London on March 18, and that the King was delighted with\r\nthe latter’s handiwork. He tells her:\r\n\r\n    “On the very same day, the 18th, the painter sent by this King\r\n    to Flanders came back with the Duchess’ likeness, which, I am\r\n    told, has singularly pleased the King, so much so, that since he\r\n    saw it he has been in much better humor than he ever was, making\r\n    musicians play on their instruments all day long. Two days after\r\n    he went to dine at a splendid house of his, where he had\r\n    collected all his musicians, and, after giving orders for the\r\n    erection of certain sumptuous buildings therein, returned home\r\n    by water, surrounded by musicians, and went straight to visit\r\n    the duchess of Suffocq, the mother-in-law of the duke of\r\n    Norfolk, and the wife of his brother, and ever since cannot be\r\n    one single moment without masks, which is a sign he purposes to\r\n    marry again, unless he does all that by way of dissimulation\r\n    whilst the bishop of Tarbes is here still.”[264]\r\n\r\nFootnote 264:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 583. _Spanish Calendar_, vol. v. pt. ii.\r\n  220.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the cost of this journey Hoby received £23, 6_s._ 8_d._ from the\r\nroyal purse, which is noted in the book of the King’s household expenses\r\nfor March 1538. “Item paid to Philip Hoby by the kinges commandment\r\ncertifyed by my lord privy seal lettre for his coste and expences sent\r\nin all possible diligence for the kinge affaires in the parties of\r\nbeyonde the See. xxiij _li._ vj_s._ viij_d._”[265]\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 1280 (f. 6).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF THE DUCHESS AT WINDSOR]\r\n\r\nNo doubt the portrait which so delighted the King was one of those\r\nmasterly studies in black chalk touched with colour, such as the “John\r\nGodsalve” among the Windsor drawings, from which Holbein afterwards\r\npainted the magnificent full-length now in the National Gallery. He\r\ncould not have done much more than this in the three hours which was the\r\nwhole time allowed him for the sitting. Sir Claude Phillips, however, is\r\nof opinion that it must have been something more than a drawing, however\r\nconsummate—perhaps a finished sketch of the head only in oils. “It is\r\ndifficult to believe,” he says, “that a layman would express so\r\nenthusiastic an approval of a drawing of modest dimensions, and (if it\r\nfollowed the usual Windsor type) of modest aspect. Neither sketch,\r\nhowever, nor drawing is known to exist.”[266]\r\n\r\nFootnote 266:\r\n\r\n  _Daily Telegraph_, May 8, 1909.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested by the late Sir George Scharf, F.S.A., that the small\r\noil panel, showing the Duchess to the waist, which is practically a\r\nreplica of the upper half of the National Gallery picture, is the\r\noriginal study made by Holbein in Brussels. This portrait, then unnamed,\r\nhe discovered in 1863, in a small apartment in Windsor Castle, and it\r\nwas described by him in a paper read before the Society of Antiquaries,\r\nand published in _Archæologia_, with a good lithograph of the picture by\r\nT. H. Maguire.[267] It is on wood, 17 in. high by 13 in. wide.\r\n\r\nFootnote 267:\r\n\r\n  “Remarks on a Portrait of the Duchess of Milan, recently discovered at\r\n  Windsor Castle, probably painted by Holbein at Brussels in the year\r\n  1538,” _Archæologia_, 1866, vol. xl. p. 106.\r\n\r\n“The picture by Holbein,” says Sir George, “could only have been a\r\ndrawing or a painting on rather a small scale, inasmuch as it had at\r\nonce to be conveyed by a messenger to England, and one of the objects of\r\nHutton’s letter was to show the diligence with which the King’s commands\r\nwere executed and to announce the coming of the picture. The scale and\r\nworkmanship of the picture before us are exactly such as might have been\r\nexpected from a first-rate painter and tactician under such\r\ncircumstances. All essential points are observed with scrupulous\r\nfidelity, and, certainly, as far as internal evidence extends, without\r\nflattery. It is not to be supposed that Holbein did nothing to the\r\npicture beyond the term of the three hours’ sitting afforded by the\r\nDuchess. Having secured all the essential points of likeness, and given\r\nthe general colouring, he doubtless spent some time in further\r\nfinishings from memory. But time must have been given for the picture to\r\ndry.”\r\n\r\nWornum, however, refuses to accept Sir George’s ascription. “The head is\r\nvigorously painted,” he says, “and very natural; it shows, however, no\r\ncomplete finish, which, if the picture referred to, is exactly what one\r\nwould expect; but it lacks also the mastery one would expect to find in\r\na free sketch by Holbein. The hands are inferior, but they appear to\r\nhave been partly repainted; the background has also been entirely\r\nrepainted.... In its present state, it looks much more like a clever\r\nstudy from the Arundel picture, than its pattern; anyhow the distance\r\nbetween them is immense, but this does not prove much, for a very\r\ninferior master to Holbein could elaborate a magical effect from a mere\r\nrough sketch, provided this possessed the real germs of truth in\r\nit.”[268]\r\n\r\nFootnote 268:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 313.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF THE DUCHESS AT WINDSOR]\r\n\r\nWoltmann, too, was of opinion that this small panel was not an original\r\nwork by Holbein. “We cannot find in the picture at Windsor,” he says\r\n“that freedom and bold masterly style which absolutely belong to a\r\nsketch from life, and which alone could have excited such lively\r\nadmiration in John Hutton. The picture at Windsor is very pretty and\r\ngraceful, but has something almost sober in its treatment. It can indeed\r\nbe just as little a copy from the large painting. It exhibits some\r\ndifferences in the costume, for instance, a somewhat larger fur collar,\r\nand another position of the fingers, although the characteristic\r\nattitude of the hands is essentially the same. Christina also wears\r\nthree rings instead of a single one; namely, a black widow’s ring on the\r\nlittle finger of the right hand, and on the next finger a gold hoop with\r\na square black stone. We might, therefore, believe that this is a copy\r\nby another hand of the sketch Holbein painted from life. In favour of\r\nthis opinion, we find the head, which the sketch naturally gave most\r\ndistinctly, by far the best part of the painting, while the rest, which\r\nwas only indicated in the sketch, appears far weaker.”[269]\r\n\r\nFootnote 269:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 1st ed., English translation, pp. 426-7.\r\n\r\nSir George Scharf describes with care the many small differences between\r\nthe two works. In addition to the three rings instead of one, mentioned\r\nby Woltmann, the fur of the dress in the smaller picture is much deeper\r\nand has every appearance of being a wide fur collar separate from and\r\nplaced over the black dress. In the larger portrait the fur is much\r\nnarrower, and evidently forms the lining and collar of the outer robe, a\r\nnarrow edging of it being shown down the front. In the National Gallery\r\npicture, too, this outer robe is open several inches in front, showing\r\nthe under-dress of black and the knotted ribbon at the waist, all of\r\nwhich are missing in the Windsor panel. Again, though the hands holding\r\nthe gloves have the same general position in both, the position of the\r\nfingers shows considerable variation. In the smaller portrait the two\r\nlast fingers of the right hand and the two middle ones of the left are\r\nbent inwards; in the larger, the only bent fingers are the two last of\r\nthe left hand. There are some other minor differences which need not be\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\nBoth pictures at one time belonged to Henry VIII, and are included in\r\nthe inventory of that King’s “money, jewels, plate, utensils, apparel,\r\nwardrobe stuffs, goods and chattels, consigned to the care of Sir\r\nAnthony Denny at Westminster.” The volume, now in the Record Office, is\r\ndated April 24, 1542. They appear again in a similar inventory, made\r\nafter Henry’s death, taken “by vertue of a Commission under the greate\r\nseale of England, bearing date at Westminster the viij day of September,\r\nin the first year of our Sovereyne Lord Edwarde the Sixte” (1547). In\r\nthese, the smaller panel is described as “Item, a Table with a Picture\r\nof the Duchesse of Myllayne.”\r\n\r\nWoltmann’s conjecture that it is a contemporary copy made from Holbein’s\r\noriginal sketch appears to be the true one, though for whom made it is\r\nnow impossible to say. There seems to be no reason why Henry, having the\r\nfull-length panel in his possession, should have commissioned this\r\nsmaller and inferior one. If ordered by Thomas Cromwell, which is not\r\nvery likely, it may have reached the King in the form of plunder after\r\nthe former’s execution; if done in order to be sent to the Duchess\r\nherself, it is strange that it should have remained in England. In any\r\ncase, it cannot have been the “slobbered” work which Hutton, in his\r\neagerness to serve his royal master, had hurriedly despatched on its way\r\nto London on the eve of Holbein’s arrival in Brussels. All the evidence\r\npoints to the latter as being the portrait of the Duchess “out of her\r\nmourning apparel” which was to be given to the Lady Marquess, who had\r\npromised to show it to Hutton when finished, as his letter tells us.\r\nHutton, pleading urgency, and knowing that the latter lady was in favour\r\nof the match, in all probability borrowed it, or begged it as a gift.\r\n\r\nThis portrait of the Duchess of Milan,[270] 70 in. by 32 in. (Pl. 21),\r\nis incomparably the greatest work from Holbein’s brush now remaining in\r\nEngland; it is, indeed, in many respects his masterpiece. It is of\r\nadditional interest and value, too, as being the only full-length,\r\nlife-size portrait of a lady painted by him. She is represented\r\nstanding, facing and looking towards the spectator, her hands in front\r\nof her holding her gloves. She is dressed in mourning apparel as the\r\nwidow of Sforza, a gown of plain black satin tied round the waist with a\r\nblack cord, and a long black cloak reaching to her feet, lined with\r\nyellow sable, with a collar of the same fur, open in the front\r\nsufficiently to allow a part of her dress to be seen. At her neck and\r\nwrists are white frills with a narrow black edging, and on her head a\r\nclosely-fitting black cap, which covers all her hair, and a part of her\r\nforehead. The gloves are pale buff, and her only ornament is a gold ring\r\nwith a red stone, probably a cornelian, on the third finger of her left\r\nhand. The floor on which she stands is of pale yellow-brown colour,\r\nthough no floor-boards are indicated, and the background is a plain one\r\nof deep blue, now almost black, only broken by the white cartellino over\r\nthe sitter’s left shoulder, which is affixed to the wall with four dabs\r\nof red sealing-wax.\r\n\r\nFootnote 270:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 2.

II., PLATE 21\r\n  THE DUCHESS OF MILAN\r\n  1538\r\n  NATIONAL GALLERY, LONDON\r\n]\r\n\r\nHolbein made the choice of a true artist in thus depicting her in her\r\nwidow’s weeds instead of in all the bravery of the court dress which she\r\nwas again beginning to assume. The effect of fine rich colour produced\r\nby this wonderful rendering of a plain black costume is masterly, but in\r\nno way detracts the attention of the spectator from the grace of the\r\nslender form and the vitality and subtle expression of the face, as more\r\nelaborate accessories might have done. The whole panel is painted with\r\nthe utmost simplicity and directness, and yet is stamped with real\r\ngrandeur of style in every delicate stroke of the brush. The modelling\r\nof the flesh is rendered with extraordinary delicacy, while the tints\r\nare unusually transparent, and a faint rosy glow of health just flushes\r\nher cheeks. Her dark-brown eyes, from under fair eyebrows, look out upon\r\nthe world with an intensity of expression which is surpassed in few, if\r\nany, portraits by the greatest masters; the red lips are full of\r\ncharacter, but not more so than the hands, which are exquisitely\r\npainted. In the painting of hands Holbein was always a master, but he\r\nnever accomplished anything finer in this direction than those of the\r\nyoung Duchess. The portrait, indeed, bears the stamp of truth in every\r\nline. The painter, who never exaggerated, has made no attempt to add to\r\nthe lady’s beauty; such as she was he painted her. The draperies are\r\nadmirably arranged, and the painting of fur and satin as good as\r\nanything Holbein ever did, even in such portraits as that of Gisze. The\r\nrestrained but stately attitude of the young girl, still only on the\r\nthreshold of womanhood, the refined, reserved, and dignified character\r\nin the fresh young face, which, though gentle, is in no way lacking in\r\nstrength, and the sense of humour lurking in the lips, combine to\r\nproduce an effect which is fascinating in the highest degree; indeed, in\r\nthe simplicity of its methods, the strength, refinement, and elegance of\r\nits conception, and in its extraordinary vitality, it must always remain\r\nnot only Holbein’s masterpiece in the portraiture of women, but one of\r\nthe greatest portraits in the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATIONAL GALLERY PORTRAIT]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Holbein painted the portrait immediately after\r\nhis return from Brussels, although some writers have suggested that it\r\nis a year or so later in date than 1538. This conclusion is based\r\nlargely on the supposition that Holbein’s visit to High Burgundy later\r\nin the same year was for the purpose of obtaining further sittings from\r\nthe Duchess; but this is an error, as will be shown in the next chapter.\r\nThe portrait was painted for Henry, and would naturally be done at once,\r\nbefore the negotiations for the marriage were broken off, and it\r\nremained in his collection throughout his life. Holbein was out of\r\nEngland more often and for a longer period in 1538 than has been\r\ngenerally supposed. In addition to at least one other continental\r\njourney on the King’s service, he was absent from about the middle of\r\nAugust until nearly Christmas, and thus everything indicates that this\r\nimportant panel was painted in April or May.\r\n\r\nAnother argument, advanced by Sir George Scharf in favour of the\r\ncontention that it was painted some time after 1538, is that the name\r\nand titles of the lady written on the fictitious piece of paper attached\r\nto the dark background near to her left shoulder, by four dabs of\r\nsealing-wax, designate her “Duchess of Lorraine.” This inscription Sir\r\nGeorge reads as: “Christine, Daughter to Christierne K. of Deñarke, and\r\nDutchess of Lotragne and heretofore (?) Dutches of Milan.” The writing,\r\nhowever, is much rubbed, and is by no means easy to decipher; thus the\r\nword which Sir George read as “heretofore,” Mr. Wornum considered to be\r\n“hered” (hereditary). “This,” Sir George goes on to say, “would, if the\r\nwriting be contemporary with the picture, bring the date to 1541, the\r\nyear of her second marriage to Francis, Duke of Lorraine and Barr. The\r\nstyle of writing on the paper may perhaps raise some question, and may\r\npossibly be found to belong to the period of James I, when through his\r\nQueen and the occasional presence of Christian IV in England, a\r\nconsiderable interest was felt in matters connected with Denmark.”[271]\r\n\r\nFootnote 271:\r\n\r\n  _Archæologia_, xl. p. 109. The date of her marriage to Lorraine\r\n  appears to have been 1540.\r\n\r\nThe inscription as it now is was probably painted over an earlier one\r\nfrom Holbein’s brush, for it is too badly done to be original; but there\r\nis no need to place it as late as Sir George suggests, for the Lumley\r\ninventory speaks of her as the Duchess of Lorraine, so that the\r\nalteration may have been due to Lord Lumley or his father-in-law. It is\r\neven possible that Holbein may have placed no title of any kind on the\r\npicture, but that the whole label was added by some other painter\r\nemployed for the purpose by the owner of Nonsuch.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Henry’s admiration for the picture, the proposed match came\r\nto nothing, though for some time Hutton continued to write letters in\r\nher praises. Thus, on the 1st April 1538, he wrote to the King:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FAILURE OF MARRIAGE NEGOTIATIONS]\r\n\r\n    “Pleasithe Your Majestie to be advertissid that synns the\r\n    departyng frome hence of Phillipe Hobbie, I have for the most\r\n    part byne dayly in the Queyns chambre, by cawse I myght withe\r\n    the more commoditie aperceve, whether the great modestiosnes,\r\n    that is in the Duches of Myllayn, proceid of a symple\r\n    yngnorance, or of a naturall inclination acompenid withe wisdom;\r\n    to that intent I myght the better sartiffie Your Highnes of the\r\n    same.

This obstacle was the fact that the Duchess was a near\r\nkinswoman of the late Queen Katherine, Henry’s first wife, and that the\r\nPope’s dispensation was therefore necessary. The negotiations dragged on\r\nthroughout the year, Hutton suddenly dying in the middle of them, on\r\nSeptember 5, just when the King his master was sending over two\r\ncommissioners, Thomas Wriothesley, one of his secretaries, and Stephen\r\nVaughan, to treat personally with the Regent. There is no need to record\r\ntheir adventures, or the manner in which that lady continually put them\r\noff with plausible excuses. They followed her about the country on her\r\njourney to Compiègne to meet the King and Queen of France. On neither\r\nside was there any real sincerity, but the Englishmen, although Dr.\r\nEdward Carne[274] was sent over to help them, could not score a point in\r\nthe game. They had several personal interviews with the Duchess, after\r\none of which they reported that “she is a godly personage, of stature\r\nhiegher thenne eyther of us, a very good womans face, and competently\r\nfaire, but very wel favored, a lytle browne.”[275]\r\n\r\nFootnote 274:\r\n\r\n  Knighted by the Emperor some years later.\r\n\r\nFootnote 275:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 550. _St. P._, viii. p. 59.\r\n\r\nAfter another interview Wriothesley wrote to the King, on February 1,\r\n1539:\r\n\r\n    “A blinde man shuld judge no colours, but surely, Sir, after my\r\n    poure entendement, for that lyttel experyence that I have, she\r\n    is mervelous wise, very gentel, and as shamfast as ever I sawe\r\n    soo wittye a woman.

Thus, Robert Warner, of the Earl\r\nof Sussex’s household, writing to Lord Fitzwater on November 21, 1538,\r\ntells him that “there is small speaking of any queen; merely a report\r\nthat it should be the duchess of Milan. In any case it will be an\r\noutlandish woman and will not happen till the spring.”[277] There was\r\nalso a report that the King had sent her a diamond worth 16,000 ducats.\r\n\r\nFootnote 277:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 884. _Ellis_, 1st series, ii. 96.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1539 Francis and Charles V were in full accord, and Henry was\r\nmaking every possible preparation for war. The Regent and the Emperor no\r\nlonger attempted to keep up the farce of a possible matrimonial alliance\r\nwith England, though even then Wriothesley was writing for Henry’s\r\n“phisnamy,” which he thought would make the Duchess leave Emperor and\r\nall rather than be frustrated of so great a match. In the end the three\r\nambassadors departed for home on March 19, though not without some\r\ntrouble, as war appeared imminent; and thus Holbein’s famous portrait\r\nremained as the only record in Henry’s possession of these long and\r\nfutile negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe picture has never left England since the day it was painted. It was\r\nin the possession of Henry VIII at the time of his death, and is\r\ndescribed in the inventory already mentioned, in which it is the twelfth\r\nentry, as—“Item, a greate table with the picture of the Duchyes of\r\nMyllayne, beinge her whole stature.” According to Mr. Lionel Cust,[278]\r\nit passed from King Henry’s collection to that of the King’s cousin,\r\nHenry Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, after whose death it belonged to his\r\nson-in-law, John, Lord Lumley, husband of the Earl’s eldest daughter and\r\nco-heiress, Lady Joan Fitz-Alan. It is included in the manuscript\r\ninventory of pictures and other objects of art belonging to Lord Lumley\r\nin the reign of Queen Elizabeth already mentioned more than once. This\r\ninventory is entitled “A Certyficate from Mr. John Lampton, Stewarde of\r\nHowseholde to John, Lord Lumley, of all his Lo: Monumentes of Marbles,\r\nPictures and tables in Paynture, with other his Lordshippes Howseholde\r\nstuffe, and Regester of Bookes. Anno 1590.” The picture is described as\r\n“The statuary of the Duchess of Myllayne, afterwards Duches of Lorreyn\r\ndaughter to Christierne King of Denmarke doone by Haunce Holbyn,” the\r\nword “statuary” being used for a standing whole-length figure.\r\n\r\nFootnote 278:\r\n\r\n  Letter to _The Times_, May 5, 1909.\r\n\r\nAgainst the contention that the picture passed directly from Henry’s\r\ncollection into the possession of the Earl of Arundel must be placed\r\nCarel van Mander’s statement that in 1574 Zuccaro saw it in the Earl of\r\nPembroke’s house in London. “The said Zucchero,” he says, “was also\r\ndelighted with the portrait of a certain Countess, dressed in black\r\nsatin, life-size, a full-length figure, unusually pretty and well\r\npainted by Holbein, and kept in Lord Pembroke’s house, where he saw it\r\nin company with some painters and lovers of art, and took such great\r\ndelight in it, that he declared he had not seen its like in art and\r\ndelicacy even in Rome; therefore went away filled with admiration.”[279]\r\n\r\nFootnote 279:\r\n\r\n  See Woltmann, English translation, p. 426.\r\n\r\nVan Mander’s book was not published until 1604, thirty years later than\r\nthis incident, and it is, of course, quite possible that either he or\r\nZuccaro made a mistake as to the ownership of the picture and the place\r\nwhere it had been seen; but the statement is very definite, and must be\r\ntaken into consideration in tracing the portrait’s history. In any case,\r\nthere is no doubt that Lord Lumley owned it in 1590, and that he was a\r\nlover of Holbein’s works, of which he possessed a considerable number,\r\nmost of which have been referred to individually in preceding pages,\r\namong them the great cartoon of Henry VII and Henry VIII belonging to\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire, and portraits of Erasmus, Sir Thomas More, and\r\nSir Henry and Lady Guideford, and the book of the Windsor drawings, all\r\nof which are entered in the inventory as “drawne” or “doone” by “Haunce\r\nHolbyn.” In Lord Lumley’s collection were also portraits of Sir Nicholas\r\nCarew, Sir Thomas Lovell, the elder and the younger Sir Thomas Wyat, and\r\nSir Thomas Hennege, some of which also may well have been by Holbein,\r\nthough no artist’s name is placed against them in the list.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HISTORY OF THE PICTURE]\r\n\r\nFor many years Lord Lumley resided at Nonsuch. The erection of this\r\npalace was begun by Henry VIII in the year in which the Duchess was\r\npainted. The house, of which Toto was probably the chief architect or\r\ndecorator,[280] was unfinished at the King’s death, and remained so\r\nduring the reign of Edward VI; but in that of Mary it was completed by\r\nthe Earl of Arundel, who had become possessed of it, “after the first\r\nintent and meaning of the said King his old maister.” Here Lord Lumley\r\nresided with his wife and father-in-law until the Earl’s death in 1580,\r\nwhen he became its owner. He added the front quadrangle, and entertained\r\nQueen Elizabeth there on more than one occasion. From his hands it\r\nreverted to the Crown in 1591 in exchange for other property. No doubt\r\nLord Lumley’s collection of pictures remained at Nonsuch until that\r\nyear, and very possibly the inventory, dated 1590, was drawn up in\r\npreparation for the removal of the works of art when this transfer of\r\nestates took place.[281]\r\n\r\nFootnote 280:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. pp. 276-7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 281:\r\n\r\n  See Cust, _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xiv., March 1909, pp. 366-8, and\r\n  _The Times_, May 5, 1909; A. W. Franks, _Archæologia_, vol. xxxix. p.\r\n  35.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Lord Lumley without issue, it is evident that the\r\npicture passed, with other portraits of the Fitz-Alan family, into the\r\npossession of Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, son of Thomas, fourth Duke\r\nof Norfolk, and Lady Mary Fitz-Alan, younger daughter and co-heiress of\r\nHenry, Earl of Arundel. Philip Howard was father of Thomas Howard, Earl\r\nof Arundel, probably the greatest art-collector the world has ever\r\nknown. When in the latter’s possession it was seen by Sandrart, in 1627,\r\nwho mentions it as the portrait of the King’s “incomparable beloved one,\r\na princess of Lorraine” (unvergleichlicher Liebstin, einer Prinzessin\r\nvon Lothringen). It was entered in the Arundel inventory of 1655 as\r\n“Duchessa de Lorena grande del naturale.”\r\n\r\nFrom that time until 1909 it remained in the possession of the Howard\r\nfamily. Walpole adds to his _Anecdotes_ a note to the effect that\r\n“Vertue saw a whole length of this princess at Mr. Howard’s, in Soho\r\nSquare.”[282] It was afterwards at Worksop Manor, then belonging to the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, and later on was removed to Arundel Castle, where it\r\nwas described in the catalogue as “a very curious portrait of a Duchess\r\nof Milan.” It was included in the exhibition of Old Masters at\r\nBurlington House in 1880, and the Duke of Norfolk then lent it to the\r\nNational Gallery, where it remained on loan for nearly thirty years.\r\nAbout 1908 the Duke informed the Trustees that he was receiving large\r\noffers for the picture, which he felt bound to consider, but that he was\r\nmost anxious that, if possible, it should be secured for the nation; and\r\nhe, therefore, gave an undertaking that before closing with any\r\npurchaser he would first offer it to the Gallery at the same price.\r\n\r\nFootnote 282:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, p. 72.\r\n\r\nOn April 22, 1909, his Grace told the authorities that he had been\r\noffered a sum of £61,000, which he had accepted, subject to the option\r\ngranted to the National Gallery of purchasing at the same price, and\r\nthat the purchasers had consented to wait until May 1 for the completion\r\nof the transaction. As the Trustees were unable to find so great a sum\r\nin so short a time, the Duke sold the picture to Messrs. P. & D.\r\nColnaghi & Co. for £61,000 on the latter date. The purchasers then in\r\nturn offered it first of all to the nation, at the enhanced price of\r\n£72,000, giving the Trustees a month in which to raise the necessary\r\nfund. A determined effort to secure the picture was then made by the\r\nchairman, Lord Balcarres, and committee of the National Art-Collections\r\nFund, but in spite of strenuous endeavours, the amount subscribed up to\r\nwithin a few days of the expiration of the time-limit fell far short of\r\nthe great sum required. Most happily, however, at the last moment a\r\nmunificent anonymous donor came forward with a gift of £40,000, which,\r\nwith £10,000 from the Government, and other subscriptions, including one\r\nfrom the vendors, enabled the Fund to complete the purchase, and thus\r\nthis great picture, undoubtedly the finest portrait Holbein ever\r\npainted, for which more than one millionaire collector was prepared to\r\ngive an even greater price for its possession, was saved for the English\r\nnation, and has at last found a permanent home in the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF THE DUCHESS AS A CHILD]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that this Duchess of Milan is identical with\r\nthe little dark-eyed girl wearing a peculiar hood in the well-known\r\npicture of the three children of the King of Denmark by Mabuse, in the\r\nEnglish Royal Collection, now in Hampton Court. This picture was\r\nengraved by Vertue in 1748, and was removed at that date from Kensington\r\nPalace to Windsor. It was thought at that time—possibly the mistake was\r\nVertue’s—to represent the three children of Henry VII, Prince Arthur,\r\nPrince Henry, and Princess Margaret, though in Henry VIII’s catalogue\r\nthey were correctly named as the “three children of the Kynge of\r\nDenmarke.” The whole matter was cleared up by Sir George Scharf in a\r\npaper read before the Society of Antiquaries in 1860, and printed in\r\n_Archæologia_.[283] The original picture appears to have been painted in\r\nthe spring of 1526 at Malines, where Mabuse was then engaged, amid other\r\nwork, in restoring pictures for the Lady Regent. From a letter from Sir\r\nRobert Wingfield to Wolsey, written from that city on the 14th March\r\n1526, we learn that the young Prince of Denmark and his two sisters were\r\nthen on a visit to their aunt, “which be right goodly and fair children,\r\nspecially the daughters.”[284] A letter from the Emperor to the Archduke\r\nFerdinand, of about the same date, also mentions this visit. “I am sorry\r\nto hear of the death of the Queen of Denmark. Her children are with my\r\naunt in Flanders.”[285]\r\n\r\nFootnote 283:\r\n\r\n  Vol. xxxix. p. 245.\r\n\r\nFootnote 284:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iv. pt. i. 2025.\r\n\r\nFootnote 285:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iv. pt. i. No. 2051.\r\n\r\nIn Charles I’s catalogue this picture was attributed to Janet (“a\r\nWhitehall piece thought to be of Jennet”); and the earliest instance of\r\nits rightful ascription to Mabuse is in the Commonwealth inventory,\r\namong the pictures at St. James’s, where it is entered as: “Three\r\nchildren in one piece by Mabuse, sold to Mr. Grinder for £10, 23rd Oct.\r\n1651.”\r\n\r\nSir George Scharf, comparing this juvenile likeness with the one painted\r\nby Holbein some thirteen years later, says: “The same features and\r\nexpression of countenance, notwithstanding the difference of years, may\r\nbe traced in both. The look of the eyes is quite the same, and I would\r\nalso invite attention to the form of the upper eyelids which, especially\r\nin the Arundel picture, become remarkably broad on the side away from\r\nthe nose.”[286] There are five or six replicas of the Mabuse picture in\r\nthis country, at Wilton, Sudeley Castle, Longford Castle, Corsham House,\r\nand elsewhere. Other likenesses of the Duchess are to be found on\r\nexisting medals both of Sforza and Lorraine, and in the fine engraving\r\nor etching of her by Agostino Carracci, published in Campo’s _History of\r\nCremona_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 286:\r\n\r\n  _Archæologia_, vol. xl. p. 140.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n                    THE VISIT TO “HIGH BURGONY”[287]\r\n\r\nNegotiations for a French wife for the King—Marie of Lorraine, Duchess\r\n  of Longueville, afterwards Queen of Scotland—Visit of Peter Mewtas\r\n  to France to obtain her portrait—Pierre Quesnel—Louise of\r\n  Guise—Holbein receives a royal licence to export beer—Hoby and\r\n  Holbein sent to Havre to take portraits of Louise of Guise and some\r\n  other lady—Renée of Guise—Expedition of Hoby and Holbein to\r\n  Joinville and Nancy to obtain portraits of Renée and her cousin,\r\n  Anne of Lorraine—Cromwell’s instructions—Letter from the Duchess of\r\n  Guise to her daughter, the Queen of Scotland, describing their\r\n  visit—Holbein’s salary and advances of his wages—Letter from Niklaus\r\n  Kratzer to Cromwell—Confusion as to the dates of Hoby’s and\r\n  Holbein’s continental journeys in 1538 owing to a wrong entry in the\r\n  _Calendar of Letters and Papers_—Holbein goes on to Basel from\r\n  Nancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 287:\r\n\r\n  The greater part of this chapter appeared in the _Burlington\r\n  Magazine_, vol. xxi., April 1912, pp. 25-30.\r\n\r\nAS already stated in the last chapter, during the whole of the time the\r\nnegotiations for the hand of the Duchess of Milan were in progress,\r\nothers were being carried on concurrently for a French bride for Henry.\r\nThe King’s personal inclination, indeed, leant much more strongly\r\ntowards an alliance with France than one with the Emperor; and on\r\nOctober 24th, the very day of Queen Jane Seymour’s death, Cromwell wrote\r\nto Stephen Gardiner and Lord William Howard, then at the French court,\r\ninforming them of Henry’s loss, and urging them to make secret inquiries\r\nas to a possible successor among the princesses of France. “Our Prince,”\r\nhe said, “our Lord be thanked, is in good health, and suckethe like a\r\nchild of his puissance, which youe, my Lord William, canne declare. Our\r\nMastres, thoroughe the faulte of them that were about Her, whiche\r\nsuffred Her to take greate cold, and to eate things that her fantazie in\r\nsyknes called for, is departed to God.”[288]\r\n\r\nFootnote 288:\r\n\r\n  _St. P._, vol. viii. (pt. v. _continued_) 478.\r\n\r\nHe went on to say that the Council were unanimously of opinion that the\r\nKing should marry again as soon as possible:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DUCHESS OF LONGUEVILLE]\r\n\r\n    “Soo considering what personages in Christendom be mete for Him,\r\n    amonges the rest there be two in Fraunce, that may be thought\r\n    on, thone is the Frenche Kinges doughter (Margaret, afterwards\r\n    Duchess of Savoy), whiche, as it is said, is not the metest, the\r\n    other is Madame de Longevile, whom they say the King of Scottes\r\n    dothe desire. Of whose conditions and qualities in every pointe\r\n    His Majeste desireth you both, with all your dexterite and good\r\n    meanes, to enquire; and likewise in what pointe and termes the\r\n    said King of Scottes standeth towards either of them; whiche His\r\n    Highnes is soo desirous to knowe, His Graces desire therin to be\r\n    nevertheles in any wise kept secret to your selfes.”\r\n\r\nThe details of the careful search which was made throughout France for a\r\nsuitable successor to Jane Seymour are to be found in the very\r\nentertaining letters written by Louis de Perreau, Sieur de Castillon,\r\nthe French ambassador in London, to Francis I and his Grand Master, Anne\r\nde Montmorency. The negotiations necessitated the despatch of numerous\r\nenvoys and messengers, and the painting of four or five portraits; and\r\nthere is very good evidence for the belief that two or three of these\r\nwere painted by Holbein, for which purpose he made at least two\r\njourneys—to Le Havre in June 1538, and to Joinville and Nancy at the end\r\nof the following August.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, Henry’s inclinations were very strongly set upon\r\nMarie of Lorraine, the eldest daughter of Claude, Duke of Guise, and the\r\nyoung widow of Charles d’Orléans, Duke of Longueville, although she had\r\nbeen promised to James V of Scotland before Jane Seymour’s death. Henry\r\nknew quite well that this arrangement had been made, but he would not\r\nlisten to the names of other ladies which were suggested to him, and\r\nmaintained with great pertinacity to Castillon that the match with\r\nScotland had not yet been settled, and that Madame de Longueville had\r\nnot herself agreed to it. “He is so amorous of Madame de Longueville,”\r\nwrote Castillon to Francis, on December 30, 1537, “that he cannot\r\nrefrain from coming back upon it.” “I asked him,” he goes on, “who\r\ncaused him to be more inclined to her than to others, and he said Wallop\r\nwas so loud in her praises that nothing could exceed them. Moreover, he\r\nsaid that he was big in person, and had need of a big wife—that your\r\ndaughter was too young for him, and as to Madame de Vendosme, he would\r\nnot take the King of Scots’ leavings!”[289]\r\n\r\nFootnote 289:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xii. pt. ii. 1285.\r\n\r\nEither in December 1537 or early in the following January, Henry sent\r\nover Peter Mewtas, of the Privy Chamber, to see the Duchess secretly,\r\nand to find out from her whether she considered herself bound to James;\r\nand as a result of this mission he appears to have convinced himself\r\nthat, whatever Francis I might have arranged, the lady herself and her\r\nparents were attracted by his offer, considering an alliance with so\r\npowerful a sovereign to be preferred to one with the “beggarly and\r\nstupid King of Scots,” as Henry termed his nephew to Castillon. There\r\nwas a political attraction, also, about the proposal, from Henry’s point\r\nof view, for if he succeeded in taking James’s bride from him it would\r\ntend to alienate the Scots from France.\r\n\r\nFormal articles of marriage, however, between the lady and James V were\r\ndrawn up in January; but in spite of this Henry stuck to his point, and\r\nabout the 1st of February Peter Mewtas was again despatched by Cromwell\r\nto find out definitely if she were still free, and also to obtain her\r\nportrait. The instructions given him need not be quoted here. They\r\nconcluded by saying that if he perceived any towardness in the lady, he\r\nwas, if possible, to get and bring with him “her picture truly made and\r\nlike unto her.”[290]\r\n\r\nFootnote 290:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 203. _St. P._, viii. 10.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PIERRE QUESNEL AND HIS SONS]\r\n\r\nMewtas’ mission proved fruitless, and he was back in London some time\r\nbefore the 6th March. There is no evidence to show that he succeeded in\r\nobtaining a portrait of Madame de Longueville, or that he took Holbein\r\nor any other painter with him for that purpose. The Duchess seems to\r\nhave been in Normandy, possibly at Longueville or Le Havre, and it may\r\nhave been left to Mewtas to obtain the services of some local French\r\npainter, if such an one were to be procured. It is more likely, however,\r\nthat a painter would be taken over for the purpose, though this was not\r\nmentioned in the instructions, as it was in the case of Hoby’s mission\r\nto Brussels. If any one were taken, it may have been Holbein, who was\r\nknown personally to Mewtas, for among the Windsor drawings there is one\r\nof the latter’s wife.[291] This, however, is mere conjecture, and there\r\nis no evidence, either in writing or in the shape of a drawing, to show\r\nthat Holbein took the portrait of this particular duchess; indeed, the\r\nfact of his journey to the Netherlands seems to point to the contrary,\r\nfor Mewtas only returned to England from France early in March, so that\r\nif Holbein had accompanied him, he would have had to start off again\r\nwithout a moment’s delay with Hoby in order to reach Brussels as he did\r\non the 10th of the same month. It was, of course, possible for him to\r\nhave made both journeys, but the interval between the two was so short\r\nthat extreme expedition would have been necessary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 291:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 339; Wornum, ii. 20; Holmes, ii. 16. See pp. 257-8.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a French painter, Pierre Quesnel, who may possibly\r\nhave been attached to Madame de Longueville’s court at the time of\r\nMewtas’ visit; in any case, he accompanied her to Edinburgh two months\r\nlater, and entered the service of James V. He came of a family of\r\nportrait painters, and also practised historical painting. His works are\r\nnow unknown, but he returned to France in 1557, and designed a painted\r\nwindow for the Augustins of Paris. He had three sons, François, Nicolas,\r\nand Jacques. François,[292] who was born in Holyrood about 1543 and died\r\nin 1619, was a portrait-painter of exceptional ability, as may be seen\r\nfrom the fine portrait of “Mary Ann Walker” belonging to Lord Spencer at\r\nAlthorp Park, of which an excellent reproduction in colour has been\r\nissued by the Medici Society in their National Portrait Series. It is\r\nsigned “F. Q.” in monogram, and dated 1572. This picture was brought\r\nfrom France about one hundred years ago, and was obtained from a\r\ndescendant of the lady’s family. In this connection it may be suggested\r\nthat the double portrait of “James V and Marie of Lorraine,”[293] in the\r\ncollection of the Duke of Devonshire at Hardwick, may possibly have\r\nbeen, in its original state, the production of the elder Quesnel’s\r\nbrush.[294] It must be noted, in conclusion, that there is no record in\r\nthe English State Papers of the result of Mewtas’ mission, and so it is\r\ndoubtful if Henry VIII ever possessed a portrait of the lady, whether by\r\nQuesnel, or Holbein, or any other painter, such as Hornebolt, in the\r\nKing’s pay.\r\n\r\nFootnote 292:\r\n\r\n  See Dimier, _French Painting in the Sixteenth Century_, pp. 191 and\r\n  289.\r\n\r\nFootnote 293:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in the _Burlington Magazine_, Oct. 1906, p. 41, in an\r\n  article on “The Portraits of Mary Queen of Scots,” by Mr. Lionel Cust\r\n  and Miss K. Martin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 294:\r\n\r\n  This picture was exhibited at the Golden Fleece Exhibition at Bruges\r\n  in 1907 (No. 130), as the work of an unknown Scottish painter.\r\n\r\nMarie was married to the King of Scots on the 9th May, thus putting a\r\nfinal end to Henry’s plans in that direction. In her place, Francis\r\noffered him, through Castillon, the choice of any other lady in his\r\nkingdom. He was told that “she had a sister as beautiful and as\r\ngraceful, clever and well-fitted to please and obey him as any other.”\r\nThis remark bore fruit, and the next morning the King sent Sir John\r\nRussell, a member of his Privy Council, to make further inquiries.\r\nCastillon told the latter that France was a warren of honourable ladies,\r\nfrom which Henry might choose, and that Louise of Guise was the very\r\ncounterpart of Madame de Longueville. He had not seen her for a long\r\ntime, but had heard her esteemed above any other lady in the kingdom.\r\nRussell then asked Castillon “to find some way that Francis (to show it\r\nwas not as a refusal that he could not have Madame de Longueville, but\r\nbecause she was promised beforehand) should offer him her sister, and\r\nsay something of it to M. Briant (Sir Francis Brian, Master of the\r\nToils, then ambassador to France), who would then send her\r\nportrait.”[295] “Probably,” added Castillon, in writing to Francis, “he\r\nis troubled that it must be known that his great instance made for the\r\none is so suddenly changed for the other.” Francis sent word in reply\r\n(May 25) that he would very willingly conclude a match with Henry and\r\nLouise of Guise; and on the 31st of the same month Castillon wrote to\r\nthe Grand Master, Montmorency, urging greater expedition in the matter.\r\n“If he (Henry) is to marry in France,” he said, “three or four must be\r\nput forward, but let them be of the best and such as Montmorency shall\r\nadvise as well to M. Brian as in letters from the King to Castillon, who\r\nshould also have portraits of these put forward.”[296]\r\n\r\nFootnote 295:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 994.

Licence to\r\nbuy and export 600 tuns of beer. _Del._ Westminster, 29th May 30 Hen.\r\nVIII.”[297] The painter was evidently prepared, when the opportunity\r\narose, to engage in small commercial speculations in order to augment\r\nhis income, as was the case with more than one of his brother artists\r\nattached to Henry’s court. Thus, in April 1531, Luke Hornebolt received\r\na licence to export 400 quarters of barley,[298] and Anthony Toto, “the\r\nKing’s painter,” was granted one in April 1541,[299] exactly similar to\r\nHolbein’s, for the exporting of 600 tuns of beer. Again, Alard Plumier,\r\n“the King’s jeweller,” in March 1542,[300] obtained grants for importing\r\n400 tuns of Toulouse woad and Gascon wine, and exporting 400 tuns of\r\nbeer; while, as already mentioned, Holbein’s friend and compatriot,\r\nNiklaus Kratzer, the King’s astronomer, received a very similar licence\r\nin October 1527.[301]\r\n\r\nFootnote 297:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 1099 and 1115(65).\r\n\r\nFootnote 298:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. v. 220(21).\r\n\r\nFootnote 299:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xvi. 779(18).\r\n\r\nFootnote 300:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xvii. 220(3).\r\n\r\nFootnote 301:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iv. pt. ii. 3540(28).\r\n\r\nHenry rose promptly to the bait of Louise of Guise as a wife in place of\r\nher elder sister, now unattainable, and as usual no time was wasted. On\r\nthe 3rd of June he despatched Philip Hoby and a painter to Havre to\r\nobtain the lady’s portrait. This we learn from a letter of Castillon’s\r\nto Montmorency, dated June 4th, describing an interview between the Duke\r\nof Norfolk and the ambassador’s “secretaire a cachetter” respecting the\r\nsuggested marriage, which concludes with the following passage: “Finally\r\nhe (Norfolk) said that yesterday he (Henry) despatched the gentleman,\r\nwho wanted to go to see” (“vouloit aller”; Kaulek reads “souloit”)\r\n“Madame de Longueville, to Hâvre de Grâce to see Mademoiselle de Guyse;\r\nfor a Scotchman has come hither who has said he wonders at the King of\r\nScots taking a widow rather than a young girl, her sister, the most\r\nbeautiful creature that ever he saw.”[302] In the same letter Castillon\r\nagain urges that portraits of two or three of the ladies mentioned in\r\nhis previous despatch should be sent as quickly as possible, as the\r\nmatter is pressing. In this document there is no reference to Hoby by\r\nname, nor mention of any painter accompanying him; nor is there any\r\nentry in the King’s Book of Payments as to any expenses paid for such a\r\njourney either to Hoby or any other special envoy. Hoby had paid a visit\r\nto France earlier in the year in connection with his master’s\r\nmatrimonial affairs. He had been sent over in February, at about the\r\nsame time as Mewtas, and evidently, like the latter, for the purpose of\r\nurging Madame de Longueville to throw over James V. For this expedition\r\nhe received exactly the same sum, £23, 6_s._ 8_d._, as for his journey\r\nto Brussels in the following March. It is entered among the royal\r\npayments for February as “Philip Hoby, sent into France about the King’s\r\nnecessaries and affairs of importance, £23, 6_s._ 8_d._”[303]\r\n\r\nFootnote 302:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 1135. Kaulek, 37.\r\n\r\nFootnote 303:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 1280 (f. 2_b_).\r\n\r\nBut although there is no record of payment for this second journey in\r\nJune to Havre, or mention of him by name, there is no doubt that Hoby\r\nwas the envoy sent, and that Holbein accompanied him. Evidence of this\r\nis contained in a letter, quoted below,[304] from the Duchess of Guise\r\nto her daughter Marie in Scotland, dated September 1, which speaks of\r\nthe arrival of Hoby and Holbein at Joinville, and mentions their earlier\r\nvisit to Havre. Contributory evidence is contained in Castillon’s letter\r\nof June 4, in which he describes the messenger sent as one who had\r\nalready been over to see, or to try to see, Madame de Longueville, which\r\nundoubtedly refers to Hoby’s journey in February. According to the same\r\nletter from Joinville, two portraits at least were painted at Havre, or\r\nrather studies made, which would only occupy the artist for an hour or\r\ntwo, as in the case of the Duchess of Milan, the sitters in question\r\nbeing Louise of Guise, who was then eighteen, and some other\r\nlady—possibly Marie or Margaret of Vendôme.\r\n\r\nFootnote 304:\r\n\r\n  See p. 148.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about the date of Hoby’s return from Havre, a third French\r\ncandidate for Henry’s hand appeared upon the scene. This was Renée, the\r\nthird daughter of the Duke of Guise, who afterwards became abbess of St.\r\nPierre de Reims. Castillon wrote to Montmorency on June 19: “If you wish\r\nto entertain this King urge always the marriages; for he only waits for\r\nthem to be presented, and the pictures must be sent immediately. He has\r\nheard that Mons, de Guyse has a daughter still more beautiful than the\r\nsecond. I hear she is in a religious order, but not professed (_qu’elle\r\nest en une religion, mais elle n’est pas religieuse_). You can say\r\nsomething of it to Mr. Bryant; for he (Henry) expects to be asked and to\r\nhave several offered to him.”[305]\r\n\r\nFootnote 305:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 1217. Kaulek, 64.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this letter that Castillon, who was probably\r\nunaware of the steps Henry was taking to obtain likenesses by means of\r\nhis own artists, was doing his utmost, on his own account, to get\r\nportraits of likely ladies sent over from France. In a later letter\r\n(July 3) he harps upon the same theme. After reporting that Henry is\r\nstill in the best of humours, and is ready to meet Francis at a house\r\nwhich he will have made between Boulogne and Calais, where they can both\r\nstay for six or seven days without pomp or great expense, he concludes\r\nby saying: “The principal point to bring him over to the interests of\r\nFrancis is that he take a wife in France, and they must be more\r\nenergetic than they have been, and let his ambassador see and send\r\nportraits and write news; for he wishes to be sought, and in the seeking\r\nthey will put him so far in that he cannot draw back.”[306]\r\n\r\nFootnote 306:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 1320. Kaulek, 65.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HENRY’S SEARCH FOR A BRIDE]\r\n\r\nIn his reply, dated July 10, Montmorency stated that a portrait of\r\nLouise of Guise had been obtained for Brian, who must have already\r\ndespatched it to England. “If the King does not decide upon her,” he\r\nsaid, “others shall be shown to Brian.”[307] Castillon, who, on account\r\nof the plague in London, was then living in Chelsea, in Sir Thomas\r\nMore’s old house, which had been lent to him by the King for the summer,\r\nannounced to Francis I on July 25 that Brian “has sent the portrait of\r\nMademoiselle de Guise, whom this King does not think ugly, as I know by\r\nhis face.”[308] In spite, however, of Henry’s appreciation of the lady’s\r\ncharms, Castillon, in a letter to Montmorency of the same date, urged\r\nthat portraits of Mademoiselle de Vendôme and the young de Guise (_i.e._\r\nRenée) should be despatched with all diligence.[309]\r\n\r\nFootnote 307:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 1356.\r\n\r\nFootnote 308:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt i. 1451. Kaulek, 73.\r\n\r\nFootnote 309:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 1452. Kaulek, 74.\r\n\r\nThroughout these negotiations Henry frequently suggested that a\r\nselection of ladies should be brought to Calais for his personal\r\napproval, in charge of Francis’ sister, Margaret of Navarre, or some\r\nother high personage, such as the Duke of Guise. “The ladies he means,”\r\nwrote Castillon to Francis on August 12, “are Mesdemoiselles de\r\nVendôsme, de Lorraine, and the two de Guise. He has heard something of\r\nthe younger of the two last, and I think he will settle on one of them.\r\nHe has a great opinion of their house.”[310] This request of Henry’s\r\ngave great offence in France, which was voiced in a letter from\r\nMontmorency to Castillon on July 29: “To bring him thither (_i.e._ to\r\nCalais), as he asks, young ladies to choose and make them promenade on\r\nshow! They are not hackneys to sell, and there would be no propriety in\r\nit. Henry has his choice of Mdlle. de Vendosme, or Mdlle. de Guise, and\r\ncan judge of their beauty by the portraits and reports made to him; and\r\nif these be not approved, there are many other ladies from whom to\r\nchoose. The selection might be left to his ambassador, Briant, who could\r\nsend portraits.”[311] Even this did not quell the King, and in the end\r\nhe was informed that Lorraine was not under the sway of Francis, and\r\nthat he would have to apply for the hand of the damsel (Anne of\r\nLorraine) to her father and mother, and as for the two daughters of\r\nGuise, one had already professed as a nun, while the other, as well as\r\nthe daughter of M. de Vendosme, could not be disposed of as though they\r\nwere on sale.\r\n\r\nFootnote 310:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 77. Kaulek, 80.\r\n\r\nFootnote 311:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 1496.\r\n\r\nThis official portrait of Louise of Guise by some French painter, which\r\nBrian sent over—and possibly a second one of Marie of Vendôme, as may be\r\ninferred from the last quoted letter—must not be confused with those\r\nprivately procured by Hoby at Havre in June. These later French\r\nportraits cannot now be traced, and it would be mere guesswork to\r\nattempt to name the artist who was employed to produce them; but a\r\ncareful search through the royal collections or in some of the older\r\nhouses in England might possibly result in their discovery.\r\n\r\nSome time in August Holbein and Hoby set out together upon their journey\r\n“into the parties of high Burgony.” The purpose of their expedition was\r\nto obtain portraits of Renée of Guise, the Duke’s third daughter, and of\r\nher cousin, Anne of Lorraine, while Hoby was to sound the latter’s\r\nfather as to his inclinations towards a possible marriage between his\r\nhouse and England. Hoby’s instructions from Cromwell, as given in\r\nabstract in the State Papers, run as follows:\r\n\r\n    “‘A memorial [by Cromwell] to my friend Philip Hoby touching\r\n    such matters as he hath now committed to his charge.’\r\n\r\n    “To repair with diligence where the young duke of Longueville\r\n    lies, where he shall find the two daughters of Mons, de Guyse,\r\n    whom he shall salute, declaring that having business in these\r\n    parts he could not omit to visit the one of them ‘of whom he\r\n    hath by his late being there some acquaintance.’ And therewith\r\n    he shall view well the younger sister, and shall require the\r\n    Duchess, her mother, or whoever has the government of them, that\r\n    he may take the physiognomy of her, that he may join her sister\r\n    and her in a fair table. Which obtained, he shall go to the duke\r\n    of Lorraine, deliver my letter of credence, and declare that no\r\n    doubt he has heard of my good will to advance some personage of\r\n    his house to the marriage of the King my master; and albeit my\r\n    purpose has not taken the effect I desired, yet my affection\r\n    remains the same; and learning lately that his Grace has a\r\n    daughter of excellent quality, I directed the said Philip, who\r\n    has other affairs there, to see her and get her picture.\r\n    Requiring him to show his inclination and devise some overture\r\n    to the King, upon which I may set forth this thing. Philip shall\r\n    also speak in the same manner to the young lady. As soon as he\r\n    has gotten her physiognomy and known the Duke’s pleasure he\r\n    shall return with all possible diligence.”[312]\r\n\r\nFootnote 312:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 380(i).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOURNEY TO JOINVILLE AND NANCY]\r\n\r\nWhen Marie of Guise married James V of Scotland she left her son\r\nFrançois, Duke de Longueville, behind her in charge of his maternal\r\ngrandmother, Anthoinette of Bourbon, Duchess of Guise, who throughout\r\n1538 was at Joinville, one of the chief residences of the family, or at\r\nplaces in the immediate neighbourhood. Joinville is a small town in\r\nChampagne, situated on the Marne between Chaumont and Saint-Dizier, and\r\nwas made a principality by Henri II in 1552 in favour of Duke Claude’s\r\neldest son, François II of Guise. Mary Queen of Scots resided there for\r\nsome time when a young girl, under the care of her maternal grandmother,\r\nthe Duchess of Guise. Miss Jane T. Stoddart, in her recently-published\r\nbook, _The Girlhood of Mary Queen of Scots_, describes Joinville as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “The train from Bar-le-Duc passes through a fertile, well-wooded\r\n    country, with many sparkling streams and closely planted\r\n    villages. There are few more picturesquely situated towns in\r\n    Eastern France than Joinville, which lies on a branch of the\r\n    Marne, in a valley overshadowed by undulating tree-clad heights,\r\n    on one of which, until near the end of the eighteenth century,\r\n    stood the Castle of the Guises.... The woods of Joinville to-day\r\n    are full of singing birds. Every variety of foliage clothes the\r\n    deep ravines. The high road leading towards Wassy is fringed\r\n    with innumerable small, well-kept gardens, and the air, on May\r\n    evenings, is not only light and bracing, but sweet with the\r\n    scent of flowers. The little town must have changed very much in\r\n    appearance since the sixteenth century. It once possessed a wall\r\n    and three gates, and an old map in the Hôtel de Ville shows more\r\n    than a dozen spires.... It acquired great importance under the\r\n    first Dukes of Guise, who used it as their habitual country\r\n    residence, and entertained royal personages in the Castle with\r\n    regal magnificence. That proud Castle was allowed to fall into\r\n    ruins during the eighteenth century.... The picturesque quays\r\n    near the church, where the grass-impeded Marne runs between rows\r\n    of tall, irregularly built houses, cannot have altered greatly\r\n    since Queen Mary’s time. In unexpected corners we find\r\n    whitewashed houses adorned with old and costly sculptor’s work,\r\n    with carved pillars, and scrolls of vine-leaves surrounding the\r\n    porch.”[313]\r\n\r\nFootnote 313:\r\n\r\n  Stoddart, _Girlhood of Mary Queen of Scots_, chapter xxi. p. 346 _et\r\n  seq._\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor Joinville, then, the diplomatist and the artist set out about the\r\nmiddle of August. The journey was a long one, and Hoby received in\r\nadvance for travelling expenses, £66, 13_s._ 4_d._, nearly three times\r\nas much as he had been paid for his earlier journeys to Havre and\r\nBrussels, thus showing that the expedition was to be of considerably\r\nlonger duration. This payment is entered in the royal accounts under\r\nAugust, anno 30, and is undated, but as may be gathered from entries\r\npreceding and following it, it was on some day between August 11 and 22.\r\nThe place of destination is not mentioned; Hoby is said merely to be\r\n“sent into the parts of beyond the sea with all diligence.”[314]\r\n\r\nFootnote 314:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 1280 (f. 32).\r\n\r\nAll the information so far to be gained about this journey is contained\r\nin a letter from the Duchess of Guise to her daughter in Scotland, dated\r\nSeptember 1, which is preserved among the Balcarres MSS. in the\r\nAdvocates’ Library in Edinburgh. From it we learn that the two\r\ntravellers reached Joinville on August 30. The letter begins by\r\ndescribing the health of the youthful Duke of Longueville, who was not\r\nquite three years old, and was growing very tall and plump, and goes on\r\nto give an account of the illnesses of various members of the family.\r\nLouise was still ill of the fever, and had not moved from her bed for\r\neight days. Her brother Claude had been ill, even to death, at Autun,\r\nbut was now quite out of danger. “Your sister Anthoinette is also ill of\r\na fever and of a rheum, but I think she will do well. Your aunt (the\r\nDuchess of Lorraine) is sent for to be at Court at the coming of the\r\nQueen of Hungary, who is to be presently at Compiègne, where the King\r\nand all the Court will be in a few days.”\r\n\r\nThe letter then continues:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN AT JOINVILLE AND NANCY]\r\n\r\n    “It is but two days since the gentleman of the King of England\r\n    who was at Havre and the painter were here. The gentleman came\r\n    to me, pretending that he was going to the Emperor, and having\r\n    heard that Louise was ill, would not go without seeing her, that\r\n    he might report news of her to the King his master. He saw her\r\n    (it was the day of her fever), and talked with her as he had\r\n    done to me. He then told me that, being so near Lorraine, he\r\n    wished to go to Nency to see the country. ‘Je me doute (doubtai)\r\n    in contynent il y allet voir la demoyselle (_i.e._ Anne of\r\n    Lorraine) pour la tirer comes les aultres;’ for which reason I\r\n    sent to their lodging to see who was there, and found the said\r\n    painter was there. In fact they have been at Nency, where they\r\n    spent a day, and were well entertained, and at every meal the\r\n    _maître de hôtel_ came to eat with them, with plenty of\r\n    presents. ‘Vella se que j’en ay encore seu; au pis alle sy\r\n    navyes pour voysine vostre seur se pouret estre vostre\r\n    cousine.’”[315]\r\n\r\nFootnote 315:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 262. Balcarres MS., ii. 20. For the\r\n  original text of this letter, see Appendix (L).\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis letter fully bears out Cromwell’s instructions to Hoby. It is plain\r\nfrom its wording that Hoby had already obtained a portrait of Louise at\r\nHavre, and at least one other, of some unnamed lady (“pour la tirer\r\ncomes _les aultres_”); and that the painter who had drawn them was the\r\npainter now at Joinville. Their journey was, however, in part at least,\r\na failure, for their chief purpose in visiting the Duchess was to obtain\r\na portrait of her daughter Renée, the “religieuse.” Hoby was ordered “to\r\ntake the physiognomy of her, that he may join her sister and her in a\r\nfair table”; in other words, he was to get a drawing of the younger girl\r\nin order that her portrait might be painted as a companion to the one of\r\nher sister Louise already completed, so that they might be hung side by\r\nside in one of those double frames hinged together of which Henry VIII\r\nhad several in his collection. Unfortunately for their purpose, Renée\r\nwas not at Joinville, so that nothing could be done, and Hoby had to be\r\ncontent with an interview with Louise in her bedchamber. The fourth\r\ndaughter, Anthoinette, was at home, but she was then only a child of\r\nseven. Thanks to the curiosity of the Duchess, however, we know that\r\nthey succeeded in the second half of their mission. They spent a day at\r\nNancy, where they were well received by the Duke of Lorraine, and\r\nevidently procured the drawing required, which Holbein would easily make\r\nin a few hours. Hoby attempted to conceal the real purpose of this visit\r\nto Nancy from the Duchess of Guise, but the lady was sharp enough to\r\nguess what was in the wind. Whether Louise or Anne, however, it was all\r\nin the family. “If the worst comes to the worst,” she tells the Queen of\r\nScots, “if you do not have your sister for neighbour, it may well be\r\nyour cousin.”\r\n\r\nThe letter is far from easy to decipher, owing to its extraordinary\r\nspelling and grammar. It is difficult to gather from it which of the two\r\nplaces Hoby and his companion first visited. The Duchess, writing only\r\ntwo days after they had been with her, says that the envoy told her that\r\n“he wished to go to Nency,” which seems to indicate a prospective\r\njourney; but, on the other hand, she says “they have been to Nency,” and\r\na journey from Joinville to Nancy and back again, together with a whole\r\nday spent at the latter place, could not possibly have been accomplished\r\nbetween August 30 and September 1, so that it looks as though they had\r\ngone straight to the Duke of Lorraine in spite of Cromwell’s\r\ninstructions, and then from there on to Joinville. The point, however,\r\nis of little importance.\r\n\r\nNeither in Cromwell’s instructions nor the Duchess’s letter is Holbein\r\nmentioned by name, but that he was the painter who accompanied Hoby\r\nseems certain. In less than a fortnight afterwards he was in Basel, an\r\neasy journey from Lorraine, where he made a stay of at least some weeks,\r\nreturning to England some time before Christmas, when he received from\r\nthe royal purse a special reward of £10 for his journey into “high\r\nBurgony.” The entry runs as follows: “December, A^o xxx:—Item payde to\r\nHans Holbyn, one of the Kingis paynters, by the Kingis commaundement,\r\ncertefyed by my Lorde pryviseales lettre, x _li._ for his costis and\r\nchargis at this tyme sent aboute certeyn his gracis affares into the\r\nparties of high Burgony, by way of his Graces rewarde, x _li._”[316]\r\n\r\nFootnote 316:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 1280 (f. 48).\r\n\r\nWornum and other writers have assumed that this journey to High Burgundy\r\nhad to do with the painting of the portrait of the Duchess of Milan. The\r\nformer even suggests that the £10 might be a deferred payment for the\r\nvisit to Brussels in March.[317] But the title “High Burgony” was quite\r\nappropriate to the district in which Joinville and Nancy are situate.\r\nWoltmann says that High Burgundy was the name given to the county of\r\nBurgundy (Franche Comté), which belonged to the Emperor, in distinction\r\nto the duchy of Burgundy, which was French, and added that, in those\r\ndays, the denomination would not have been impossible for\r\nSwitzerland.[318] It may be taken, therefore, considering the lack of\r\naccurate geographical knowledge then existing in England, that the\r\nexpression “High Burgony” sufficiently indicated, in the mind of the\r\nkeeper of the royal accounts, that part of the world in which Guise and\r\nLorraine had their headquarters.\r\n\r\nFootnote 317:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 315.\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. p. 455.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PAYMENT OF HOLBEIN’S SALARY]\r\n\r\nThat the payment of this special reward to Holbein—his travelling and\r\nother expenses would be included in the sum of £66, 13_s._ 4_d._ paid to\r\nHoby—was deferred until Christmas was owing to the fact that, finding\r\nhimself so near Switzerland when at Joinville, he seized the opportunity\r\nof paying a visit to his family in Basel, and so remained absent from\r\nEngland for about three months in all. Another point in favour of the\r\ncontention that Holbein was abroad on the King’s business during 1538\r\nmore often than has been generally supposed, is to be found in the fact\r\nthat at the Midsummer quarter he received three-quarters of a year’s\r\nsalary in advance. At Lady Day he had been paid his customary quarter’s\r\nsalary: “Lady Day, Anno xxix:—Item for Hans Holben, paynter, vii _li._\r\nx_s._”\r\n\r\nAt Midsummer he received £30, a whole year’s salary, but it included the\r\nquarter from Lady Day then owing to him. The entry reads: “Midsummer,\r\nAnno xxx:—Item for Hans Holbyn, paynter, for one hole yere’s annuitie\r\nadvaunced to him beforehand the same yere, to be accomptedde from o^r\r\nLadye dey last past, the somme of xxx _li._”\r\n\r\nOn the two following quarter-days, owing to this payment in advance, he\r\nis entered as receiving nothing:\r\n\r\n    “Michaelmas, A^o xxx:—Item for Hans Holbyn, paynter, wages\r\n    nihil^a quia solutum per warrantum.” “Christmas, A^o xxx:—Item\r\n    for Hans Holbyn, paynter, Nihil.”\r\n\r\nThis payment in advance has generally been regarded as a mark of the\r\nKing’s special favour and as an acknowledgment of his talents as an\r\nartist, but it was more probably due to his frequent absences from\r\nEngland at that time. On the one hand, his several journeys might well\r\nentail some amount of extra expenditure not covered by his travelling\r\nallowances, while on the other his income would be reduced through the\r\nlimited time left him for painting the portraits of English courtiers or\r\nGerman merchants. There is, in fact, no portrait from his brush bearing\r\nthe date 1538. Added to this, his great success in painting the Duchess\r\nof Milan must be taken into account. The King was delighted with this\r\nportrait, and his choice would naturally fall upon the man who had\r\npainted it when a similar journey was in contemplation.\r\n\r\nThere is one piece of evidence, however, against the assumption that\r\nHolbein was the painter who went to Joinville, which must not be\r\noverlooked—a letter from Niklaus Kratzer, the King’s astronomer, to\r\nCromwell. It is a much-mutilated epistle, written in somewhat halting\r\nand incorrect Latin. Kratzer begins by saying that he had received, the\r\nday before writing, by a ship from Antwerp, two little books by Georgius\r\nSpalatinus, which the author had sent to him in order that he might\r\npresent them to Cromwell. “These,” he says, “I gave to Hans Holbein\r\n(Joanni Holbein), in order that he might give them to you.” At first\r\nsight this looks as though Kratzer might have given Holbein the books to\r\ndeliver, knowing that he was about to visit Cromwell for final\r\ninstructions on the eve of his departure for High Burgundy. The\r\nletter,[319] however, is dated St. Bartholomew’s Day, August 24 (Datum\r\nLunduni, in [festo Sancti] Bartholomei), so that if Kratzer had seen\r\nHolbein on August 23, the latter could not possibly have reached\r\nJoinville by the 30th; for although the King’s messengers were\r\naccustomed to travel with great expedition—Castillon complains to\r\nMontmorency that the English couriers took only five or six days between\r\nParis and London, whereas the French messengers took double that time—it\r\nwould have been impossible, even with the utmost speed then attainable,\r\nto reach the far borders of eastern France within a week. But although\r\nthe letter is dated “St. Bartholomew’s Day,” it has no year-date. It has\r\nbeen placed under the year 1538 by the editor of the _Calendars of\r\nLetters and Papers_ from such internal evidence in it as it is possible\r\nto decipher; but it is so badly mutilated that it is impossible to make\r\nmuch sense of the greater part of it. It contains news from abroad, and\r\nmentions Burgratus, vice-chancellor of the Duke of Saxony; and Burgratus\r\nwas certainly in London in the summer of 1538, with other envoys from\r\nthe German Protestant princes. These envoys, however, paid more than one\r\nvisit to England. As, therefore, the letter contains no evidence\r\nabsolutely conclusive of the date 1538, it may, perhaps, be permitted to\r\nhold the opinion that it was written in some other year, and that, by\r\nitself, it is not sufficient to negative the strong proofs brought\r\nforward to show that Holbein was the painter who made this particular\r\njourney into France. Nor was this the only occasion on which Spalatinus\r\nused Kratzer as the medium for sending copies of his writings to\r\nCromwell. On February 5, 1539, Cromwell wrote to the King, enclosing “a\r\nbook brought this morning by Nic. Cratzer, astronomer, which Geo.\r\nSpalatinus, some time schoolmaster to the duke of Saxony, desired him to\r\ndeliver to the King, on ‘The Solace and Consolation of Princes.’”[320]\r\n\r\nFootnote 319:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 179.\r\n\r\nFootnote 320:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. i. 227. _St. P._, i. 592.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DATE OF HOBY’S INSTRUCTIONS]\r\n\r\nOne other point in connection with this subject must be mentioned before\r\nleaving it. Hoby’s instructions for visiting the courts of the Duchess\r\nof Guise and the Duke of Lorraine are not dated. The editor of the\r\n_Calendars_ has entered them under February 1538, together with the very\r\nsimilar instructions for the visit to the Duchess of Milan, which are\r\nalso undated, placing both under the one heading, “Philip Hoby’s\r\nMissions.” For the latter instructions, which he puts second, February\r\nis, of course, the correct date, but the former should be under August,\r\nas the preceding pages prove. Dr. Gairdner was misled, in the first\r\nplace, by the fact that in February Hoby received payment from the royal\r\npurse for a journey to France, and, in the second, through his\r\nmisreading of the heading to the Brussels instructions, as explained in\r\nthe last chapter.[321] By the insertion of two unnecessary words,[322]\r\nthe last-named instructions are made to read as though it was Cromwell’s\r\nintention that Hoby, on this particular journey, should go first of all\r\nto the Duchess of Lorraine, and then to the Duchess of Milan. He\r\nconcludes from this, in his preface to vol. xiii. pt. i. of the\r\n_Calendars of Letters and Papers_, that Hoby went to France in February\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining the portraits of Marie of Guise and her\r\nsister Louise in a single picture, and immediately upon his return set\r\nout for Brussels to get one of the Duchess of Milan. There is no need to\r\nquote the whole of his argument, as it is based upon a misapprehension,\r\nfor the instructions in question were undoubtedly drawn up in August, as\r\nthe letter of the Duchess of Guise, of the 1st of September, clearly\r\nproves.[323]\r\n\r\nFootnote 321:\r\n\r\n  See above, pp. 119-20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\n  “Instructions given by the L. Cromwell to Philip Hoby, sent over by\r\n  him to the Duchess of Lorraine then [to the] Duchess of Milan.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\n  After pointing out that the instructions order Hoby to return home at\r\n  once after obtaining portraits of the two Guises and the daughter of\r\n  the Duke of Lorraine, he continues: “Yet instructions for his\r\n  proceeding on another very similar mission seem to have been drawn up\r\n  at or near the same time; and by these second instructions he was not\r\n  to come home at all, but proceed at once from the duchess of Lorraine\r\n  in France to the duchess of Milan in the Netherlands. It would seem,\r\n  however, that the heading to the second set of instructions has been\r\n  supplied by a transcriber of a later date, and it is clearly\r\n  inaccurate.” _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i., preface, p. xxxviii.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this anxiety to obtain portraits, Henry’s negotiations for a\r\nFrench marriage were as unsuccessful as his advances for the hand of the\r\nDuchess of Milan. In each case, no doubt, the proposed alliance was\r\nlargely political, though Henry seems to have been genuinely anxious to\r\nmarry Madame de Longueville, or to prevent his nephew of Scotland from\r\ndoing so, and was afterwards by no means unwilling to take one of her\r\nsisters. Throughout the whole proceedings the French and the Imperial\r\nambassadors in London kept each other well informed of what was going\r\non, though each one was of the private opinion that Henry was more\r\ninclined towards a bride from his country than from the other’s. Thus\r\nChapuys, writing to Charles V early in 1539, reports that “everybody\r\nsays he is much inclined to the duchess of Milan, whom, as I was\r\ninformed three days ago, by one who knows almost all secrets, he would\r\nwillingly take, even if she were delivered to him naked without a\r\npenny.”[324] On the other hand, Castillon told Montmorency: “He,\r\nhowever, says the practice of his marriage with the duchess of Milan\r\nstill continues, ... but I know he would willingly return to marry\r\nMademoiselle de Guise. If you think the King (Francis) and Emperor\r\nshould have the pastime of seeing him thus ‘virolin virolant,’ I can\r\neasily get it up, provided a little good cheer is made to his\r\nambassador, and that M. le Cardinal or M. de Guise caress him a\r\nlittle.”[325] Henry, however, finally turned his attentions in another\r\ndirection, while two of the ladies he had sought were soon married\r\nelsewhere, Louise of Guise to Charles de Croi, Prince de Chimaix, in\r\n1541, and Anne of Lorraine to René, Prince of Orange, in 1540. The\r\nthird, Marie of Vendôme, died unmarried, aged twenty-two, on 28th\r\nSeptember 1538, a week or two after Holbein was at Joinville.[326]\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. i. 37 (9 Jan. 1539.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. ii. 1120 (2 Dec. 1538.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n  She was betrothed to François, Duke of Nevers, who married her sister\r\n  Margaret before the end of the same year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN’S MOVEMENTS IN 1538]\r\n\r\nWhether Holbein painted pictures of one or all of these ladies from the\r\ndrawings he made in France it is impossible to say. The drawings\r\nthemselves cannot be traced, but this does not prove that they were not\r\ntaken, for the preliminary studies of Christina of Milan and of Anne of\r\nCleves and her sister Amelia have so far remained undiscovered. Holbein\r\nand Hoby parted company at Nancy early in September, the former to visit\r\nhis wife and family in Basel, while the latter returned post-haste to\r\nLondon, no doubt taking with him Holbein’s sketch of Anne of Lorraine in\r\norder to show it to his royal master. In October Hoby set out for Spain,\r\nin connection with the negotiations for the Milan marriage.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this chapter and the preceding one may be summarised as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_February 1, 1538._—Peter Mewtas sent over to France to obtain the\r\n    portrait of Marie of Lorraine, Duchess of Longueville. Early in\r\n    the same month Philip Hoby was also sent into France for the\r\n    same purpose (about the King’s “necessaries and affairs of\r\n    importance”), for which he was paid £23, 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n_March 2 or 3, 1538._ —Hoby and Holbein left London for Brussels to\r\n    obtain the portrait of the Duchess of Milan, reaching the latter\r\n    place on the evening of the 10th.\r\n\r\n_March 12, 1538._—Holbein made his drawing of the Duchess, and the\r\n    two men started home on the evening of the same day, reaching\r\n    London on March 18.\r\n\r\n_April and May 1538._—Holbein at work on the full-length portrait of\r\n    the Duchess of Milan.\r\n\r\n_May 29, 1538._—Holbein received a royal licence to export 600 tuns\r\n    of beer.\r\n\r\n_June 3, 1538._—Hoby and Holbein left London for Havre to obtain the\r\n    portrait of Louise of Guise, and of some other lady, possibly\r\n    Marie or Margaret of Vendôme.\r\n\r\n_June 30, 1538._—Holbein received three-quarters of a year’s salary\r\n    in advance.\r\n\r\n_August 11-22, 1538._—On one of the days between these dates Hoby\r\n    and Holbein left London for Nancy and Joinville to obtain\r\n    portraits of Renée of Guise and Anne of Lorraine, receiving £66,\r\n    13_s._ 4_d._ for their travelling expenses. They arrived at\r\n    Joinville on August 30, to find Renée absent, but were\r\n    successful at Nancy in getting a likeness of Anne. From\r\n    Joinville Hoby returned to London, and Holbein went on to Basel,\r\n    which he reached before September 10. He remained there until\r\n    after October 16.\r\n\r\n_December 1538._—Holbein, upon his return to London, received a\r\n    special reward of £10 “for his costis and chargis at this tyme\r\n    sent aboute certeyn his gracis affares into the parties of high\r\n    Burgony, by way of his Graces rewarde.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n                            BASEL REVISITED\r\n\r\nHolbein’s return to Basel—Fêted by his fellow-citizens—His prosperous\r\n  condition—Proposes to repaint his wall-decorations—Offer of a pension\r\n  of fifty gulden from the Basel Town Council, with permission to remain\r\n  in England two years longer—Death and will of Sigmund Holbein—Holbein\r\n  returns to England, probably by way of Paris, in order to apprentice\r\n  his son Philip to Jacob David, goldsmith—Back in London before\r\n  Christmas 1538—Receives a special reward for his journey to “High\r\n  Burgony”—Portraits of Edward, Prince of Wales—Guillim Stretes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME nine days after Hoby and Holbein parted company at Nancy the latter\r\nwas home again in Basel after an absence of six years.[327] The journey\r\nacross the Vosges mountains would not be a long one. On September 12,\r\n1538, Rudolph Gwalther, then studying in Basel, wrote to the antistes\r\nHeinrich Bullinger in Zürich: “Hans Holbein came recently to Basel from\r\nEngland, and he gives such a glowing account of the happy condition of\r\nthat kingdom, that after a few weeks’ stay he means to go back\r\nagain.”[328] He received a very hearty welcome from the citizens, who,\r\nnow that his reputation was much more than a local one, were naturally\r\nproud of the fact that he was one of themselves. On September 10 his\r\nfellow-burghers gave a banquet in his honour in the Guild-house in the\r\nSt. Johanns-Vorstadt, the quarter of the city in which Holbein’s own\r\nresidence was situated. Matthäus Steck, the steward of the Dominican\r\nMonastery, notes in his Book of Accounts that he and the schoolmaster,\r\nBrother Jacob, with their wives, were present on the occasion, and that\r\nthey spent eight shillings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  Unless, as suggested above (see p. 63), he had paid an earlier visit\r\n  to Basel, about 1534-5, of which, however, there is no actual\r\n  evidence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  “Venit nuper Basileam ex Anglia Johannes Holbein, adeo felicem ejus\r\n  regni statum praedicans, qui aliquot septimanis exactis rursum eo\r\n  migraturus est.” This letter, which was first quoted by Hegner (_Hans\r\n  Holbein der Jüngere_, p. 246), is now among the Zürich State Papers in\r\n  the Antistical Archives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROPOSAL TO REPAINT WALL-PAINTINGS]\r\n\r\nThere is a most interesting reference to this home-coming in Dr. Ludwig\r\nIselin’s additions to the Faesch manuscript (discovered by Dr.\r\nHis-Heusler), in which he says: “When he returned to Basel for a time\r\nfrom England, he was attired in silk and velvet; before this he was\r\nobliged to buy wine at the tap.”[329] In Basel, a city where wine was\r\nboth cheap and plentiful, and all men of means kept a well-stocked\r\ncellar, to be obliged to procure it, from day to day, from the tavern\r\nwas a sign of poverty, and Iselin thus contrasts Holbein’s worldly\r\ncondition before leaving Switzerland and after his entry into the\r\nservice of Henry VIII. Iselin adds, after stating that Holbein died soon\r\nafter his return to England, that “his intention was, had God lengthened\r\nhis life, to paint many of his pictures again, at his own expense, as\r\nwell as the apartment in the Town Hall. The house ‘zum Tanz,’ he said,\r\nwas ‘rather good.’” The pictures which he wished to put in order were,\r\nof course, his wall-paintings on the exterior of several of the Basel\r\nhouses, done in his youth, some eighteen years earlier, which even then\r\nwere beginning to suffer from exposure to the weather, and his frescoes\r\nin the Town Hall, some of which were already damaged by damp. No doubt,\r\ntoo, he felt that he could improve upon them, though it is interesting\r\nto note that he expressed himself satisfied with the “House of the\r\nDance” façade, in which he had given the freest play to his imagination.\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n  See Woltmann, i. p. 456 and ii. p. 43.\r\n\r\nTwice during his absence in England, on November 23, 1533, and January\r\n7, 1537, he had been “laid out for the banneret” by his Guild “zum\r\nHimmel”—that is, appointed as one of those who had to perform the\r\nmilitary service of the Guild, but he had ignored the summons.[330]\r\nPossibly he knew nothing about it. He had even disregarded the letter\r\nfrom the burgomaster, sent to him in September 1532, shortly after his\r\nreturn to England, in spite of the offer of a pension which it\r\ncontained; for England afforded far better opportunities than\r\nSwitzerland for the making of money.\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  See Woltmann, i. p. 457. English translation, p. 430.\r\n\r\nThe two items, from the Banner Book of the Guild “zum Himmel,” are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  “Item A^o 1533 Jar vff Sunthag vor kattrinen Sind dise her noch\r\n      geschriben von beyden Zünfften vss gelegtt vom Himels vnnd\r\n      Sternen.\r\n\r\nErstlich zum Fenlin vnd Baner.\r\n\r\n     .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  . Zum Baner.\r\n\r\n     .  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  . Hanns Holbein der Moller” (his name\r\nbeing at the head of a number of other guildsmen).\r\n\r\n  “A^o 1537 Jar vf Sunthag noch dem nuwen Jar Sindt dise Hemach\r\n      geschriben zum Fenlin vnd zu dem Baner vss geleytt erstlich Himels\r\n      vij Mann (here follow the seven names).\r\n\r\n  Zum paner xiij man.” Here follow the thirteen names, among them being\r\n      “Hanns Holbein der maller.”[331]\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, ii. p. 32, quoting from His, _Die Baseler Archive_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe first entry is brought forward by Mr. W. F. Dickes as one of the\r\nstrongest pieces of evidence in favour of his contention that Holbein\r\nobeyed the request contained in the Burgomaster’s letter, and returned\r\nto Basel in the winter of 1532, and remained there throughout the\r\nfollowing year, so that he could not have painted “The Ambassadors” in\r\nEngland in 1533. He entirely misreads the entry, however, which he\r\nregards as a record “of monies due to Holbein for festal decorations on\r\nbehalf of the two city guilds”[332] (Von Himmel und von Sternen); and he\r\nignores the second entry, which, to be logical, should prove that\r\nHolbein was also in Basel in January 1537. No “monies” are entered\r\nagainst these items, as one would gather from his description, so that\r\nit is difficult to see how they record sums due to the painter. They\r\nwere merely lists of names, as Woltmann points out,[333] of members of\r\nthe Guilds appointed to take their turn of military service on festal\r\noccasions. The second entry shows this even more clearly than the first,\r\nand from it we learn that Holbein was one of thirteen members thus\r\nappointed as banner-bearers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 332:\r\n\r\n  Dickes, _Holbein’s Ambassadors Unriddled_, p. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 333:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. p. 457.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OFFERED PENSION BY BASEL COUNCIL]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that one of the chief reasons for Holbein’s visit to\r\nBasel, in addition to a natural desire to see his family, was to make\r\nsome arrangement with the Town Council for a further leave of absence.\r\nHe was now in the actual service of a foreign sovereign, and he ran the\r\nrisk of losing his rights of citizenship unless he could come to some\r\nunderstanding with the civic authorities. He had taken, as we have seen,\r\nno notice of the Council’s urgent request, sent after him to England in\r\nthe autumn of 1532, and he had ignored the calls made upon him by the\r\nPainters’ Guild during the six years of his absence, for fulfilling his\r\nshare of various official and ceremonial duties. Probably he was quite\r\nunaware that such calls had been made. Now, however, that he was in\r\nHenry VIII’s pay, it was necessary that some definite arrangement should\r\nbe made, which would enable him to remain in England at least some years\r\nlonger without risk of unpleasant consequences. The Council, seeing that\r\nhe had become a painter of high reputation, known far beyond the\r\nconfines of Switzerland, were more anxious than ever to keep him in\r\nBasel. Aware, however, that they were not rich enough to find him\r\nemployment as remunerative as that enjoyed by him at the English court,\r\nthey effected a compromise. A document was drawn up, after consultation\r\nwith the painter, in which a much more generous offer was made to him\r\nthan the one proposed in 1532. This agreement, which was signed on\r\nbehalf of the Council by Jakob Meyer, “zum Hirschen,” after extolling\r\nHolbein’s reputation as a painter, offered him a pension of fifty gulden\r\na year, with permission to remain in England for two years longer,\r\nduring which time they would pay his wife a pension of forty gulden.\r\nAfter his final return to Basel, he was still to be permitted to receive\r\nservice money from foreign kings, princes, nobles, and cities, and, in\r\norder to sell his pictures, was to be allowed to visit France, England,\r\nMilan, or the Netherlands once, twice, or thrice a year for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe document runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Master Hans Holbein the painter’s Pension.”\r\n\r\n    “We, Jacob Meyger, Burgomaster, and the Council of the city of\r\n    Basel, do make known and acknowledge with this letter that:\r\n\r\n    “From the special and favourable will which we bear to the\r\n    honourable Hans Holbein, the painter, our dear citizen, since he\r\n    is famous beyond other painters on account of the wealth of his\r\n    art; weighing further that in matters belonging to our city\r\n    respecting building affairs and other things which he\r\n    understands, he can aid us with his counsel, and that in case we\r\n    had to execute painting work on any occasion, he should\r\n    undertake the same, for suitable reward, we have therefore\r\n    consented, arranged, and pledged to give and to present to the\r\n    above-named Hans Holbein a free and right pension from our\r\n    treasury of fifty gulden, though with the following conditions,\r\n    and only during his lifetime, whether he be well or ill, yearly,\r\n    in equal parts at the four quarters.\r\n\r\n    “As however the said Hans Holbein has now sojourned for some\r\n    time with the King’s Majesty in England, and according to his\r\n    declaration it is to be feared that he can scarcely quit the\r\n    Court for the next two years, we have allowed him under these\r\n    circumstances to remain in England the two years following this\r\n    date, in order to merit a gracious discharge, and to receive\r\n    salary, and have consented during these two years to pay his\r\n    wife residing among us forty gulden yearly, _i.e._ ten gulden\r\n    quarterly, which are to begin from next Christmas, as the end of\r\n    the first quarter. With the addition that in case Hans Holbein\r\n    should receive his discharge from England within these two years\r\n    and should return to us at Basel and remain here, that we should\r\n    from that moment give him his pension of fifty gulden, and let\r\n    it be paid to him in equal parts at the end of the quarter. And,\r\n    as we can well imagine that the said Holbein, with his art and\r\n    work being of so far more value than that they should be\r\n    expended on old walls and houses, cannot with us alone reap much\r\n    advantage, we have therefore allowed the said Holbein, that,\r\n    unimpeded by our agreement, for the sake of his art and trade,\r\n    and for no other unlawful and crafty matters, as we have also\r\n    impressed upon him, he may gain, accept, and receive service\r\n    money from foreign kings, princes, nobles, and cities; that\r\n    moreover he may convey and sell the works of art which he may\r\n    execute here once, twice, or thrice a year, each time with our\r\n    special permission, and not without our knowledge, to foreign\r\n    gentlemen in France, England, Milan, and the Netherlands. Yet on\r\n    such journeys, he may not remain craftily abroad, but on each\r\n    occasion he shall do his business in the speediest manner, and\r\n    repair home without delay and be serviceable to us, as we have\r\n    before said, and as he has promised.\r\n\r\n    “In conclusion, when the oft-mentioned Holbein has paid the debt\r\n    of nature according to the will of God, and has departed from\r\n    this valley of tears, then shall this warrant, pension, and\r\n    present letter be at an end, and we and our descendants\r\n    therefore are not pledged to give aught to anyone. All upright,\r\n    honourable, and with integrity. This letter, signed with our\r\n    official seal, we have given into the hand of the oft-mentioned\r\n    Holbein as a true document. Wednesday the sixteenth day of\r\n    October, anno xxxviii.”[334]\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. pp. 458-9.

They, therefore, made many concessions, which would enable him\r\nto pursue his art with almost the same freedom he had hitherto enjoyed.\r\nIn spite of the liberality of the terms, however, the document remained,\r\nas far as Holbein was concerned, a dead letter throughout the five\r\nremaining years of his life; at least, no evidence has so far been\r\ndiscovered to show that he ever visited Basel again, though, as\r\nsuggested in an earlier chapter,[335] he may have done so about the year\r\n1541. Whether his wife received the pension of 40 gulden for the first\r\ntwo years is not known. There is no mention of it in the Council’s\r\naccounts, but Woltmann suggests that it may have been given, as was\r\noften the case with pensions of this kind, out of the monastery\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  See p. 63.\r\n\r\nHolbein was bound to return to England for at least another six months,\r\nas he had received nine months’ salary in advance, but there can be\r\nlittle doubt that he had, at the time, every intention of accepting the\r\nCouncil’s conditions. He was, however, so popular in England, and had so\r\nmuch work on hand, that he found it increasingly difficult to leave, so\r\nthat in the end his arrangement with the Basel Council fell to the\r\nground. It has been suggested, too, that the death of his uncle Sigmund\r\nin Berne, in November 1540, at about the time when Holbein was due to\r\nreturn to Basel, may have had something to do with his determination to\r\nremain in England; for Sigmund bequeathed all his property to his “dear\r\nbrother’s son Hans,” and it was handed over to the latter’s wife in his\r\nabsence. The will, from which we learn that “Sigmund Holbeyn” was then a\r\ncitizen of Berne, and being old, was about to make a journey to Augsburg\r\nto see his relations, continues:\r\n\r\n    “In the first place, I will and bequeath to my dear brother’s\r\n    son Hans Holbeyn, the painter, citizen at Basel, both as my\r\n    blood relation and my own race and name, as well as from the\r\n    especial love I bear him and from the affinity in which he\r\n    stands to me, the free gift of all my goods and property which I\r\n    have and leave in the city of Berne, namely, my house, and\r\n    courtyard, and the garden behind, standing in the Brunnengasse,\r\n    on the sunny side, above by the Trom Wall, near Görg Zimmerman,\r\n    the tailor’s, house. The said property is free from taxes, with\r\n    the exception of five pounds interest, including the\r\n    commutation-capital, which I owe out of it to Herr Bernhard\r\n    Tillman, treasurer of the council at Berne, for money lent.\r\n    Item, my silver utensils, household furniture, colours,\r\n    painter’s gold and silver, implements for painting, and other\r\n    things, nothing excepted, that he shall appropriate the same as\r\n    my appointed heir, have it in his possession, do with it and\r\n    live as with his own possession and property, unmolested by my\r\n    sisters and by any one. What I have here bequeathed to him, will\r\n    be found noted on a separate roll, so that my cousin can better\r\n    inquire after it.”[336]\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, English translation, p. 106. Original text in Woltmann, ii.\r\n  p. 33-5.\r\n\r\nHe left what property he possessed in Augsburg to his three sisters,\r\nUrsula Nepperschmid and Anna Elchinger in Augsburg, and Margreth Herwart\r\nin Esslingen. The will is dated September 6, 1540, and the testator died\r\nvery shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of November the Berne Town Council wrote to both Basel and\r\nAugsburg notifying his heirs of his decease, and on the 10th January in\r\nthe following year the property was handed over to Holbein’s stepson, as\r\nthe authorised agent of his mother. The confirmation of the testament,\r\nin the name of Hans Franz Nägely, burgomaster of Berne, speaks of him as\r\n“the honourable and wise Franz Schmid, citizen of Basel,” and says that\r\nhe brought “a procuracy and a letter from Elsbeth, the wife of Master\r\nHans Holbein, the painter, citizen of Basel, and also a letter from the\r\nburgomaster and council of the town of Basel.”\r\n\r\nThis legacy would serve to some extent in place of the annuity of 40\r\ngulden paid by the Council to Elsbeth Holbein, which would cease when\r\nher husband failed to carry out his part of the agreement. Woltmann\r\nsuggests that she probably settled in Berne in consequence of this\r\nbequest, in the house on the sunny side of the Brunnengasse, although\r\nthere is no documentary proof of this. On the other hand, the inventory\r\nof her household goods and property, drawn up after her death in 1549,\r\nand preserved in Basel, indicates that she never permanently severed her\r\nconnection with that city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP HOLBEIN AND JACOB DAVID]\r\n\r\nHolbein must have set out again for England shortly after the drawing up\r\nof this agreement, and there is some reason to suppose that he travelled\r\nback by way of Paris, taking his elder son, Philip, with him, and\r\napprenticing him in that city for six years to Jacob David, the\r\ngoldsmith, who was a native, and still remained a citizen, of Basel.\r\nThis information is obtained from a letter addressed to David from the\r\nBurgomaster Adelberg Meyer and the Council of Basel, dated 19th November\r\n1545,[337] with reference to a dispute between the apprentice and his\r\nmaster, the latter refusing to give him his discharge on the completion\r\nof his six years’ service. This letter speaks of Holbein as deceased,\r\nand refers to Philip as a “good, pious youth,” still in his minority,\r\nand under the care of his step-brother, Franz Schmid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 337:\r\n\r\n  Discovered, and first published, by Dr. His-Heusler.\r\n\r\nDavid is informed that “it has credibly reached our ears that thou wilt\r\ngive no discharge to Philipp Holbein (but that thou hast brought him\r\nmoreover in Paris before the Lord-Lieutenant), although he has served\r\nthee honestly and honourably his six years, which were promised by his\r\nfather, the deceased Hans Holbein, our citizen, now when he, at\r\nbefitting opportunity, desires to depart from thee, and this not alone\r\non account of his honest and honourable service, as was thy duty before\r\nGod and in all honour. Thus thou addest one cause of complaint to\r\nanother, and aimest at oppressing the good, pious youth as far as thou\r\ncanst and in causing his ruin. This thine unfriendly conduct has caused\r\nus not a little regret; we had in no wise foreseen it, but had rather\r\nhoped that if any one sought to hinder another in his success and\r\nwelfare, thou would’st have taken up his cause and protected him....\r\nBesides, this Philipp Holbein is in his minority, and is under the care\r\nof Franz Schmid, his brother, our citizen, and without his help and\r\nauthority is qualified for no lawsuit; it is our pleasure, therefore,\r\nand we herewith request thee as our citizen, that thou forthwith and\r\nimmediately breakest off the complaint brought by thee against Philipp\r\nHolbein and allowest him, kindly and friendly to depart from thee, and\r\nbecause he has served thee honestly and truly, that thou givest him a\r\ngood sealed letter of discharge, of which he may make use. In all this\r\nwe express our earnest will and command; we have also written to the\r\nLieutenant who is judge between you both, our citizens, not to continue\r\nthe proceedings, and to refer you both hither.” The letter concludes by\r\nsaying that if David feels he has a just claim against Philip, he is to\r\ncite him before the municipal court of Basel, when full justice shall be\r\ndone. A letter to the same effect, and of the same date, was sent to\r\nPhilip, ordering him not to enter into any further law proceedings in\r\nParis, but to take his discharge and return to Basel, where his case\r\nwould be decided by the municipal authorities.[338]\r\n\r\nFootnote 338:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, English translation, pp. 329-30.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear from this letter to David that the dispute arose shortly\r\nafter the completion of Philip’s six years of apprenticeship, in which\r\ncase the boy must have been left in Paris in the autumn of 1539, and not\r\nof 1538. If that was so, then Holbein cannot have personally apprenticed\r\nhim on his return to England from Basel, and Philip must have gone there\r\na year later in charge of someone else. It is possible, however, that\r\nHolbein took his son with him to England, and kept him there for twelve\r\nmonths or so, sending or taking him to Paris in 1539. It is usually\r\nsupposed that the boy in the family group of 1528 represents Philip, the\r\nelder son, born about 1522. In the picture he appears to be five or six\r\nyears old. He would thus be about fifteen or sixteen in 1538—rather a\r\nlate age upon which to enter his apprenticeship—and twenty-two at the\r\ndate of the letter, which, however, speaks of him as still a minor.[339]\r\n\r\nFootnote 339:\r\n\r\n  It is possible that the boy in the picture is not the one who was\r\n  taken to Paris, but that the latter was a second son, born during\r\n  Holbein’s second residence in Basel (1528-32), whose age would thus be\r\n  in better accord with the evidence of the letter.\r\n\r\nHolbein was back again in London some time before Christmas, 1538, when\r\nhe received the special reward of £10 for his journey into Upper\r\nBurgundy. His first work of importance after his return was a portrait\r\nof the infant Prince Edward, then some fourteen months old. This was\r\npresented to the King on January 1, 1539, being entered in the roll of\r\nNew Year’s gifts as: “By Hanse Holbyne a table of the pictour of the\r\np^ince (Prince’s) grace.” In return he received from his royal master a\r\nsilver-gilt covered cup supplied by Cornelis Hayes, one of the King’s\r\ngoldsmiths. “To Hans Holbyne, paynter, a gilte cruse w^t a cover\r\n(Cornelis) weing x oz. quarter.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAITS OF PRINCE EDWARD]\r\n\r\nHolbein died when Edward was just six years old, so that he cannot have\r\npainted the various portraits of the Prince in which he is represented\r\nat a somewhat later period of life and after he was King, though at one\r\ntime they were all attributed to him. There are only three portraits of\r\nhim, and a few drawings, which show him as a child of tender years, of\r\nwhich the authorship can be given to Holbein. The picture in the\r\nProvinzial Museum, Hanover, is generally regarded as the original work\r\nwhich he painted as a New Year’s gift for the King. An almost identical\r\npicture is in the possession of the Earl of Yarborough, which some\r\nwriters regard as an unquestionable work of Holbein, while others\r\nconsider it to be merely an excellent old copy.\r\n\r\nThe Hanover picture[340] is a life-size, half-length figure, facing the\r\nspectator. The child is dressed in a red velvet coat trimmed with gold,\r\nand sleeves of gold brocade. A red hat, with gold tags and a large\r\nostrich feather, tied under the chin, surmounts the closely-fitting cap,\r\nfrom beneath which his fair hair falls over his forehead. His right hand\r\nis held out with open palm, and in his left he grasps a gold rattle. In\r\nfront of him is a stone or panel on which eight lines of Latin verse\r\nfrom the pen of Sir Richard Morysin are inscribed, exhorting the Prince\r\nto imitate his wonderful father. “Little one, imitate your father,” the\r\nlines run, “and be the heir of his virtue, the world contains nothing\r\ngreater—Heaven and Nature could scarcely give a son whose glory should\r\nsurpass that of such a father. You only equal the acts of your parent,\r\nthe wishes of men cannot go beyond this. Surpass him, and you have\r\nsurpassed all the kings the world ever worshipped, and none will ever\r\nsurpass you.”[341] The head stands out well against the sky-blue\r\nbackground. The round, chubby face, and small fat hands, are most\r\ntruthfully and delightfully rendered, while the colour scheme is very\r\nharmonious. It is, indeed, in all ways, a most sympathetic and\r\ndelightful study of childhood.\r\n\r\nFootnote 340:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 165.

According to Wornum, it was at one time in the Arundel\r\nCollection, at Stafford House, and was sold in 1720, subsequently\r\npassing into the possession of Sir Richard Worsley, of Appuldurcombe,\r\nIsle of Wight, and afterwards to the present owner. The same writer\r\nnotes some few peculiarities in its execution—“some defects in the right\r\nhand, and a certain want of transparency, or a mealyness in the\r\ncolouring, that are not entirely consistent with Holbein’s\r\npractice.”[343] It is most probably an old and careful copy after the\r\noriginal at Hanover. It was in the Tudor Exhibition, 1890 (No. 174), and\r\nthe Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1909 (No. 62).\r\n\r\nFootnote 342:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in the Catalogue of the Tudor Exhibition, 1890, p. 80; and\r\n  _Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition Catalogue_, 1909, Pl. xxi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 343:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 323.\r\n\r\nCharles I had a copy of this portrait made by Peter Oliver, signed “P.\r\nO.,” and inscribed “Edwardus Princeps Filius Henrici Octavi Regis\r\nAngliae.” In the King’s catalogue it is described by Van der Doort as:\r\n“22. Item, the picture of King Edward VI in his infancy, in a red cap\r\nwith a white feather, and a red coat laced with gold, and golden cloth\r\nsleeves, holding in his left hand a round golden rattle, and with his\r\nright hand in some action; by a green table, whereupon is written in\r\nwhite and black letters. Being in a black shutting frame. Painted upon\r\nthe wrong light. 4¾ in. × 2 in.” A marginal note describes it as “copied\r\nby Peter Oliver after Hans Holbein, whereof my Lord Arundel has the\r\nprincipal limning.” Wenceslaus Hollar engraved the picture in 1650,[344]\r\nwhen it was in the Arundel Collection.[345]\r\n\r\nFootnote 344:\r\n\r\n  Parthey, 1395.\r\n\r\nFootnote 345:\r\n\r\n  There were two portraits of the Prince in the Arundel Collection, both\r\n  attributed to Holbein in the 1655 inventory, and entered as “Eduardo\r\n  Sesto Re d’Inghilterra.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Northumberland’s version, at Syon House,[346] is larger, and\r\nthe Prince is shown at full-length. It resembles the two others in most\r\nparticulars, and appears to be based on the same original drawing,\r\nthough the sitter looks somewhat younger. He is wearing a jacket of\r\npatterned cloth of gold, and over it a crimson frock or coat embroidered\r\nwith golden stripes. His head is covered with a white-edged, striped\r\nskull-cap, beneath which a fringe of fair hair falls on the forehead;\r\nover this is worn a red hat with a dark feather in it. Thick-soled,\r\nbroad-toed shoes complete his costume. He is standing on a green velvet\r\ncloth edged with gold, which is thrown over an ornamental stone tablet\r\ncontaining, as in the other versions, Morysin’s Latin verses. The\r\nbackground is a dark green curtain. It is painted on panel, 4 ft. 3 in.\r\nhigh by 2 ft. 5 in. wide.\r\n\r\nFootnote 346:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 246.\r\n\r\nThis picture has suffered considerably from rubbing and cleaning. The\r\npreliminary chalk drawing can be plainly seen through the thin painting.\r\nThe position of the hands—which are beautifully painted—is somewhat\r\naltered, and the child is without his rattle. In one corner of the\r\ntablet is inscribed “Edwardus Princeps,” and in the other “Filius\r\nHenrici 8,” now almost obliterated. Mr. Wornum[347] thought it probable\r\nthat this was the New Year’s gift picture, as the child appears to be a\r\nlittle younger than in the Hanover and Yarborough versions, and with a\r\nstill brighter expression of face.\r\n\r\nFootnote 347:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 325.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 22\r\n  EDWARD VI\r\n  1538-9\r\n  LORD YARBOROUGH’S COLLECTION\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DRAWINGS OF PRINCE EDWARD]\r\n\r\nAll three pictures seem to have been based upon the same drawing in the\r\nWindsor Collection, in which the Prince is shown full-face, as a young\r\nchild, with a close skull-cap, and a black cap with a feather above it,\r\nand a single frill round his neck.[348] This drawing has been badly\r\nrubbed. There is a second drawing in the same collection, also\r\nfull-face, with hair cut closely across the forehead, and a plain black\r\nhat (Pl. 23).[349] This, too, has suffered considerable damage. The\r\nstrong brush-work of the outlines stands out with undue emphasis, owing\r\nto the destruction of the more delicate modelling of the crayons. In\r\nthis drawing the Prince appears to be at least a couple of years older\r\nthan in the other drawing, or in the Hanover picture and its variants.\r\nHe looks quite four or five years old. Mr. Wornum thought it might\r\nrepresent Henry Brandon, afterwards Duke of Suffolk, from its likeness\r\nto the boy in Holbein’s beautiful miniature, the proportions of the face\r\nnot quite agreeing with those of the infant Prince;[350] but it is\r\nundoubtedly a portrait of the latter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 348:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 326; Wornum, ii. 1; Holmes, not given.\r\n\r\nFootnote 349:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 327; Wornum, ii. 2; Holmes, i. 2.

It is one of the least pleasing of the\r\nseries, and if by Holbein, must be almost the last drawing he made, as\r\nthe Prince was but six when the painter died. He is shown in profile to\r\nthe left, with hat and feather, and almost yellow hair.[351] Several\r\nportraits exist which are based on this drawing, though they are not by\r\nHolbein, among the best of them being the versions in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery,[352] the Victoria and Albert Museum,[353] and the\r\ncollection of Lord Sackville. The last-named was at the Burlington Fine\r\nArts Club in 1909 (No. 60). In this the Prince has golden hair, a black\r\ncap with a white plume, and a purple gown lined with white fur over a\r\npale pink doublet. His right hand, raised, holds a rose, and his gloves\r\nare in his left. The background is a greenish blue.\r\n\r\nFootnote 351:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 328; Wornum, ii. 3; Holmes, ii. 1.

The face, however, is decidedly longer and more oval in shape\r\nthan in the Windsor drawings; but much of the delicate modelling of the\r\nflesh has vanished during the passage of time, so that it is difficult\r\nto speak with absolute certainty as to the likeness. Most probably the\r\nattribution is the correct one. The boy, who appears to be about five\r\nyears old, is dressed in a princely costume, and is holding a meerkat in\r\nthe bend of his right arm, and stroking its back with his left hand.\r\nThere is no portrait known which follows this drawing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 354:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 30. Reproduced by Ganz, _Hdz. Schwz.

His costume is much the same as in the pictures described, and\r\nhe is seated on a cushion on the grass, fondling a small dog with his\r\nleft hand. The background on either side of him is filled in with\r\nbranches of oak with acorns. It may have been the first study for a\r\nminiature, or possibly a design for a medallion or hat-badge to be\r\ncarried out in gold-and-enamel by one of Holbein’s goldsmith friends. In\r\nspite of its small size the likeness is evident.\r\n\r\nFootnote 355:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 110 (82). Reproduced by Ganz, _Hdz. von H.

In the days when it was believed that Holbein lived until 1554,\r\nall these portraits were attributed to him, whereas now some other\r\nauthorship must be sought. It is known that Guillim Stretes, the Dutch\r\npainter, was responsible for at least two of these portraits of the\r\nyoung King. According to Strype,[356] in 1551 Stretes was paid by the\r\nPrivy Council “fifty marks for recompence of three great tables, made by\r\nthe said Guillim, whereof two were the pictures of his Highness sent to\r\nSir Thomas Hoby and Sir John Mason (ambassadors abroad); the third a\r\npicture of the late Earl of Surrey, attainted, and by the council’s\r\ncommandant fetched from the said Guillim’s house.” In 1553 “Gillam\r\nStrettes, Dutchman,” was the King’s painter, in receipt of the high\r\nsalary of £62, 10_s._ a year, and he continued in favour during the\r\nreign of Queen Mary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 356:\r\n\r\n  _Memorials_, &c., Vol. ii. p. 494.

II., PLATE 23\r\n  EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES\r\n  _Drawing in black and coloured chalks_\r\n  WINDSOR CASTLE\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LATER PORTRAITS OF EDWARD VI]\r\n\r\nThe excellent little bust portrait of Edward, formerly in the possession\r\nof the Cokayne family at Rushton Hall, Northamptonshire, which was lent\r\nby Lord Aldenham to the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1909 (No. 63), has\r\nbeen attributed to this painter. It is dated 1550. Mr. Roger E.\r\nFry,[357] on account of the delicate and personal scheme of blonde and\r\ncool colouring which it displays, considers this portrait to be by the\r\nsame hand as the portraits of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, lent to the\r\nsame exhibition (Nos. 21 and 46) by Lord Sackville, which have been\r\nmentioned in an earlier chapter.[358] Others exist of the same type to\r\nwhich Stretes’ name has been provisionally given. The Duke of Portland\r\nhas a fine small full-length, undated,[359] probably from the same hand\r\nas Lord Aldenham’s panel; another whole-length belongs to Mr. Vernon J.\r\nWatney, while a third is at Southam Delabere, near Cheltenham. A very\r\ninteresting portrait of a different type is at Petworth, an\r\nelaborately-painted likeness of the young King at full-length, seated on\r\nhis throne, with a canopy over his head, which is dated 1547, when he\r\nwas in his tenth year. This is attributed by Mr. Wornum to Stretes.[360]\r\nThere is another in Christ’s Hospital which closely resembles it, and in\r\nthe same building there is a second portrait of the Prince at the age of\r\nnine. There is also a fine example in the Royal Collection at Windsor\r\nCastle,[361] in which the head is of the same type as that in Lord\r\nAldenham’s picture. It is apparently by the same hand as that of the\r\nPrincess Elizabeth, also at Windsor, and whether by Stretes or not,\r\nseems to be of Franco-Flemish origin. The large picture at Bridewell\r\nHospital, representing Edward VI transferring Bridewell Palace to the\r\nCity of London, was regarded in Walpole’s day as an excellent example of\r\nHolbein’s brush, and both he and Vertue, who engraved it in 1750,\r\nasserted that one of the figures in the background represented Holbein\r\nhimself.[362] The occurrence which the picture commemorates, however,\r\ntook place in 1553, ten years after Holbein’s death. This picture, too,\r\nhas been tentatively given to Stretes, but it is a work of no great\r\nmastery, though of undoubted historical interest. Descriptions of other\r\nportraits of Edward VI will be found in a paper contributed by Mr. J.\r\nGough Nichols, F.S.A., to _Archæologia_.[363] No less than sixteen, of\r\nvarying degrees of merit, were lent to the Tudor Exhibition in 1890. In\r\nthe inventory of King Henry VIII’s pictures made shortly after his\r\ndeath, dated September 8, 1547, three of the earlier portraits of the\r\nyoung Prince of Wales were included. Two of these were full-lengths:\r\n“The Kynge’s Majestie, the whole stature, in a gowne like crymsen satten\r\nfurred with lusernes,” which was protected by a curtain of white\r\nsarcenet; and “The Kynge’s Majesty, the whole stature, stayned upon\r\nclothe” (_i.e._ canvas), with a curtain of green sarcenet. The first\r\nnamed was not included in the earlier list of King Henry’s pictures\r\ndrawn up in 1542, but the latter is in that inventory, and so must have\r\nbeen painted before 1542, and thus represented Edward as a little child.\r\nThe third portrait is merely described as “The Kynge’s Majestie.” This\r\nmay have been the curious “perspective” portrait of the young Prince,\r\nnow in the National Portrait Gallery (No. 1300),[364] a head within a\r\ncircle surrounded by a well-painted landscape, done in 1546, which has\r\nbeen attributed to Stretes. According to Walpole,[365] who considered it\r\nto be the work of Marc Willems, “Gulielmus pinxit” was written on the\r\nframe. It formed part of the Royal collections from the time it was\r\npainted, but was sold by the Commonwealth in 1650 for £2.

It is true that more than one of his undated works may\r\nbe of this period, but there is no actual proof, beyond that of style,\r\nin favour of such a contention. This may be accounted for to some extent\r\nby his frequent absences from England on the King’s business, which\r\nwould leave him less time than usual for private practice, while there\r\nis also the possibility that at least some of the works he produced\r\nduring these two years have been lost.\r\n\r\nFootnote 366:\r\n\r\n  The portrait of Henry VIII in the National Gallery, Rome, now\r\n  attributed to Holbein, was painted, according to the King’s age\r\n  inscribed on the background, in 1539 or 1540. See above, p. 103.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1539, when alarms of war were in the air, and the\r\nalliance between Francis and the Emperor was growing closer every week,\r\nHenry had abandoned all idea of a marriage in France or with the Duchess\r\nof Milan, and was turning his thoughts towards Protestant Germany. The\r\nproject of this fresh matrimonial venture was not entirely a new one; it\r\nwas under consideration during the previous summer in the midst of the\r\nmore active negotiations elsewhere. There is a curious passage in one of\r\nEustace Chapuys’ letters to the Emperor, dated London, 17th June 1538,\r\nin which he infers that Henry had grown less anxious for the Milan match\r\nbecause the Germans were making him offers. “Indeed it is a fact,” he\r\nsays, “that about that time the King sent to Germany a painter (_ung\r\npaintre_) and one gentleman of his chamber for the express purpose of\r\npourtraying the personages ‘au naturel’; for, although Cromwell at first\r\ndenied this, or at least dissembled, he afterwards owned to me (Chapuys)\r\nthat the report was true, that both from France and Germany several\r\nmarriages had been proposed.” These marriages, he adds, according to\r\nreport, were to be between the son of the Duke of Cleves and the\r\nPrincess Mary, and Henry and one of the Duke’s kinswomen.[367]\r\n\r\nFootnote 367:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiii. pt. i. 1198. _Spanish Calendar_, v. ii. 225.\r\n\r\nThis is the only reference in the State Papers to the despatch of one of\r\nthe King’s painters to Germany in the earlier part of 1538, but it is\r\ninteresting as containing a possible reference to Holbein and to some\r\njourney of his of which we have no further knowledge. It is much more\r\nlikely, however, that Chapuys was misinformed, and that no such\r\nexpedition actually took place, though it may have been suggested but\r\nafterwards abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SEARCH FOR A BRIDE IN GERMANY]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January 1539, Christopher Mont, or Mount, a German\r\nin Henry’s service, was sent abroad with letters of credence to the Duke\r\nof Saxony and the Landgrave. The ostensible purpose of his mission was\r\nto promote the attempted agreement between the English and German\r\ndivines which had been the subject of numerous conferences in the\r\nprevious year; but the real object was to find out to what extent Henry\r\nmight rely upon the German Protestant princes in any trouble which might\r\narise between England and the Pope or Emperor. At the same time, Mont,\r\nwho was accompanied by Thomas Paynell, took with him private\r\ninstructions from Cromwell, which included a secret message to Francis\r\nBurgartus,[368] the Duke of Saxony’s vice-chancellor, with respect to a\r\nmarriage between the young Duke of Cleves and the Princess Mary, which\r\nhe and Cromwell had discussed in London in the previous year. If, the\r\ninstructions ran, Burgartus desire “the picture of her face,” Mont is to\r\nremind him that she is a King’s daughter, and that it was not the custom\r\nto send the picture of persons of such degree abroad. Burgartus, too,\r\nhad seen her, and could testify of her proportion, countenance, and\r\nbeauty. But there was a matter of still greater importance about which\r\nMont was to sound the vice-chancellor, whose master, the Duke of Saxony,\r\nhad married the eldest daughter of the Duke of Cleves, and was one of\r\nthe most interested parties in any alliance proposed between England and\r\nGermany. Mont was to inquire diligently of the beauty and qualities of\r\nthe elder of the two unmarried daughters of the Duke of Cleves, her\r\nshape, stature, and complexion, and, if he heard she was such “as might\r\nbe likened unto his Majesty,” he was to throw out suggestions as to a\r\nmarriage between her and the King. The proposal, however, must come from\r\nthe side of Cleves, as the overtures made to his Grace in France and\r\nFlanders had not been finally refused. Mont, in short, was not to speak\r\nas if demanding her, “but rather to give them a prick to offer her;” but\r\nfirst of all, “it is expedient that they should send her picture\r\nhither.”[369] In this way the Princess Anne of Cleves first appears on\r\nthe scene, and the Duchess of Milan, and the ladies of Guise and other\r\nroyal French houses finally vanish from it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 368:\r\n\r\n  Or Burgratus (Burchardt).\r\n\r\nFootnote 369:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. i. 103.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards other diplomatists were sent abroad for the same\r\npurpose. Dr. Barnes went over to Frankfurt to attend the diet of the\r\nEvangelic League, while Dr. Edward Carne and Dr. Nicholas Wootton,\r\ntogether with Richard Byrd, Bird, or Beard, one of the gentlemen of the\r\nKing’s Chamber, were despatched to Düren, to the court of the young Duke\r\nof Cleves, whose father had recently died. Their instructions were very\r\nsimilar to those given to Mont. They were to offer an offensive and\r\ndefensive league and an English bride to the Duke, but were merely to\r\nthrow out hints with regard to Anne. Here again they were to demand a\r\npicture of the lady before the match could be considered, for Henry was\r\nalways most anxious to see what his proposed bride was like before\r\ncommitting himself too far.[370] If she were ill-favoured he would have\r\nnone of her, however useful for political reasons such an alliance might\r\nprove to be. A portrait was always asked for, but was by no means always\r\nconsidered sufficient. The King feared that such pictures might flatter\r\nthe subject, and so it became his habit, in order to avoid such\r\npossibilities, to send over one of his own painters to procure an\r\nindependent likeness. Holbein, in particular, he knew to be capable of\r\nbringing back a true portrait, more valuable in all ways than the\r\nefforts of some unknown foreign painter, or the written opinions of his\r\nambassadors, whose taste might not always agree with his own.\r\n\r\nFootnote 370:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. i. 489, 490.\r\n\r\nMont, after an interview with the Duke of Saxony, wrote to Cromwell to\r\nsay that he seemed favourable to the proposed marriage, and that he\r\npromised to send a portrait as soon as possible, but said that “his\r\npainter Lucas was sick at home.” “Everyone,” he added, “praises the\r\nlady’s beauty, both of face and body. One said she excelled the Duchess\r\n(of Milan) as the golden sun did the silver moon.”[371] The Lucas\r\nreferred to in this letter was Lucas Cranach the elder, and if it had\r\nnot been for his illness Holbein might not have been sent over, for\r\nCranach, no doubt, would have painted a portrait which would have\r\nsatisfied the King. Towards the end of April, Cromwell wrote to Beard\r\nand Wootton, again urging them to get a portrait of the lady, which the\r\nformer was to bring to London as quickly as possible.[372] In their\r\nreply, dated May 3—the letter, unfortunately, is badly mutilated—they\r\ndescribe a recent interview with Dr. Henry Olisleger, the\r\nvice-chancellor of Cleves, the young Duke being away at the Diet. “He\r\nsaid also he would cause the portraits of both the Duke’s younger\r\nsisters to be delivered to us in fourteen days. They were made, he said,\r\nhalf a year before. We said there was no occasion to declare the King’s\r\ngoodwill to the Duke, which was manifest.... And as for the ij pictures,\r\nwe wer verye w[ell] contentyd to receyve theym, and specyallye the\r\nimaige of my l[ady Anne] ... that yf eny of bothe shulde lyke his Grace\r\n... yet wolde we gladdelye receyve and sende bothe. [And for a]s muche\r\nas we hadde not seene the ij ladyes, we shulde [not be] able to\r\nadvertise his Majestye whether theyr imaiges were [l]yke to theyr\r\npersones, and so shulde his Majestye be never the nerre by the syht of\r\nthe pictures.” Dr. Olisleger, however, assured them that the portraits\r\nwere faithful likenesses, but the ambassadors were not satisfied. “We\r\nsayde, we hadde not seene theym, for to see but a parte of theyr faces,\r\nand that under such a monstruouse habyte and apparell, was no syght,\r\nneither of theyr faces nor of theyr persones. Why, quod he, wolde yow\r\nsee theym nakydde?” What they said in answer to this last remark is lost\r\nthrough the mutilation of the letter, but they evidently did not approve\r\nof the court costume of Cleves. They concluded by saying: “A Moneday,\r\nGod willing, we wylle departe to Duisseldorpe, and, excepte the Duke\r\nhave enye bysynesse with us, we wyll thence to Coleyn, where we ar\r\napoyntyd to receyve the said ij pictures, the which we wille send ynto\r\nEngland as soone as we canne convenyently.”[373]\r\n\r\nFootnote 371:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. i. 552. _St. P._, i. 604.\r\n\r\nFootnote 372:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. i. 834. _St. P._, i. 613.\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. i. 920.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN AND BEARD GO TO DÜREN]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these constant demands for portraits, the ambassadors do not\r\nappear to have received them at the time promised. Early in July Dr.\r\nWilliam Petre, one of the Clerks of Chancery, was sent to Cleves with\r\nfurther messages and instructions to Dr. Wootton. The new ambassador and\r\nthe old were to make a further demand to see the ladies, and if Beard\r\nhad not already started with the portraits, they were to send them “if\r\nthey may be possible gotten,” with their opinion of them as\r\nlikenesses.[374]\r\n\r\nFootnote 374:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. i. 1193.\r\n\r\nBeard was back in London for a short time in July, but whether he came\r\nempty-handed or not there is no record to show. It is possible that he\r\nbrought with him the two portraits promised by Olisleger, which were to\r\nbe handed to him at Cologne. There is a portrait of Anne in England,\r\ndescribed below, which may be one of the two in question, but in any\r\ncase it cannot have satisfied Henry, for Beard was sent back almost\r\nimmediately to Düren, taking Holbein with him, in order that he might\r\npaint the two sisters. They were allowed £40 for travelling expenses,\r\nwhile Holbein received a further sum of £13, 6_s._ 8_d._ for his own\r\npersonal outlay in connection with his craft.\r\n\r\nThe following is the entry in the Treasurer’s accounts:\r\n\r\n    “July, A^o xxxi—Item, to Mr. Richard Bearde, one of the gromes\r\n    of the Kingis privi-chambre, and Hans Holbyn, paynter, by like\r\n    lettre sent into the parties of High Almayne upon certain his\r\n    gracis affaires, for the costes and chardgis of them both, xl.\r\n    _li._ And to Hans Holben, for the preparation of such thingis as\r\n    he is appoynted to carie with him, xiij. _li._ vi._s._\r\n    viii_d._—in alle the some of liij _li._ vi._s._ viii_d._”[375]\r\n\r\nFootnote 375:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 781 (f. 85).\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Woltmann, the extra fee of £13, 6_s._ 8_d._ paid to\r\nHolbein for “the preparation of such things as he is appointed to carry\r\nwith him,” was, “without doubt a portrait of the King, perhaps a\r\nminiature in a costly frame, which he had to paint and to present to the\r\nPrincess as a gift from his monarch.”[376] This explanation, however, is\r\nnot at all likely to be the correct one. As already pointed out, Henry\r\nnever sent portraits of himself to the lady he was preparing to honour\r\nwith his hand until he had first of all seen what she herself was like.\r\nHe was too cautious a lover to commit himself so far. In all these\r\ntransactions he was the one who was to be sought, and the first offer\r\nmust come from the lady’s side. The simplest explanation is that the\r\nmoney was for the provision of the necessary painting materials, and the\r\ncost of their carriage. The sum was, no doubt, a large one if for such a\r\npurpose alone, but Holbein was then high in the King’s favour, and well\r\npaid for all that he did, while his absence from England on the royal\r\nbusiness put an end for the time to his general practice, and this might\r\nhave been considered in fixing the amount of his allowance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 376:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. p. 463.\r\n\r\nThe travellers reached the castle of Düren, where the ladies were\r\nliving, early in August, and Holbein at once set to work. He had\r\nfinished portraits of both Anne and her sister Amelia before the 11th of\r\nthe month, as we learn from a letter of that date from Dr. Wootton to\r\nHenry VIII. In the course of it he says: “Your Grace’s servant Hanze\r\nAlbein hathe taken th’effigies of my ladye Anne and the ladye Amelye and\r\nhath expressyd theyr imaiges verye lyvelye.”[377]\r\n\r\nFootnote 377:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 33.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that in this instance Holbein did more than make mere\r\nstudies in crayons such as he had done in the case of the Duchess of\r\nMilan and the French ladies; and the fact that the portrait of Anne of\r\nCleves, now in the Louvre, is on parchment fastened down on a wood panel\r\naffords some proof of this. The portrait would be painted on the\r\nparchment directly from the sitter, and afterwards mounted and the\r\nfinishing touches given to it. Owing to the haste required, and the\r\nsafer conveyance of the portrait, the latter process was probably not\r\ncarried out until the artist was back in London.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GOSSIP ABOUT THE KING’S MARRIAGE]\r\n\r\nNo time appears to have been wasted. Henry not only demanded but\r\nobtained speed from his servants on their numerous journeys. Travelling\r\npost, the journey to and from Düren, which was usually made via Antwerp,\r\ntook about eleven days. Holbein was in England again before the end of\r\nAugust, as we learn from Marillac, the new French ambassador, who, on\r\nSeptember 1, writing from Grafton, where he had followed the King fifty\r\nmiles from London, informed Francis I that he “has learnt that an\r\nexcellent painter whom this King sent to Germany to bring the portrait\r\nof the sister of the Duke of Cleves, recently arrived in Court, and,\r\nimmediately afterwards, a courier, bringing, among other news which is\r\nstill kept secret, news that the said Duke’s ambassadors have started to\r\ncome hither to treat and conclude the marriage of this King and the said\r\nlady.”[378]\r\n\r\nFootnote 378:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 117. Kaulek, 124.\r\n\r\nThe proposed marriage afforded opportunity for much speculation on the\r\npart of the King’s subjects, as more than one of his earlier matrimonial\r\nprojects had done. An excellent idea of the kind of gossip which\r\nprevailed can be gathered from the evidence taken in the case of a\r\ncertain George Constantyne, who talked so much that he got himself\r\ncharged with treason. It occurs in the report of a conversation between\r\nConstantyne and the Dean of Westbury during a journey they made together\r\nto South Wales, and in the course of it Holbein’s visit to Cleves is\r\nmentioned. “The Dean asked also if Constantyne had any news of the\r\nKing’s marriage. Replied, he could not tell; he was sorry to see the\r\nKing so long without a queen, when he might yet have many fair children:\r\nhis own father was ninety-two years old, and yet, last summer, rode\r\nthirty-two miles one day before two o’clock, and said he was not weary;\r\nthe duchess of Milan and that of Cleif were both spoken of, as the Dean\r\nknew. Asked, ‘How call ye the little doctor that is gone to Cleif?’ The\r\nDean said, it was Dr. Woten, and that he that was with him of the Privy\r\nChamber, whom Woten sent home lately, was Berde; adding that this Berde\r\nwas sent thither again with the King’s painter, and that there was good\r\nhope of the marriage, for the duke of Cleif favoured God’s word and was\r\na mighty prince now, having possession of Gelderland against the\r\nEmperor’s will.... Said also that the matter of the duchess of Milan was\r\nreally broken off, for she would have the King accept the bishop of\r\nRome’s dispensation and give pledges. ‘Why pledges?’ asked the Dean.\r\n‘Marry,’ said Constantyne, ‘she sayeth that the King’s Majesty was in so\r\nlittle space rid of the Queens, that she dare not trust his Council,\r\nthough she durst trust his Majesty; for her Council suspecteth that her\r\ngreat aunt was poisoned, that the second was innocently put to death,\r\nand the third lost for lack of keeping her in childbed.’ Added, that he\r\nwas not sure whether this was her answer or that of Cleif, but that he\r\nheard a muttering of it before Whitsuntide.”[379] It will be seen from\r\nthis gossip that the legend respecting the Duchess of Milan’s refusal to\r\naccept Henry because she had fear for the safety of her head was\r\ncommonly believed at the time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 400. _Archæologia_, xxiii. 56.\r\n\r\nThe written descriptions of Anne which Henry received from his\r\nrepresentatives and agents were all favourable, but not enthusiastic.\r\nWootton in the letter referring to Holbein, already quoted, says of her:\r\n“She has been brought up with the lady Duchess her mother (as the lady\r\nSybille also was till she was married and the lady Amelye has been and\r\nis) and in manner never from her elbow, the lady Duchess being a wise\r\nlady and one that very straitly looketh to her children. All report her\r\nto be of very lowly and gentle conditions, by the which she hath so much\r\nwon her mother’s favour that she is very loth to suffer her to depart\r\nfrom her. ‘She occupieth her time most with the needle, wherewithall\r\nshe.... She canne reede and wryte her ... Frenche, Latyn, or other\r\nlangaige she [hathe no] ne, nor yet she canne not synge nor playe [upon]\r\nenye instrument, for they take it heere in Germanye for a rebuke and an\r\noccasion of lightenesse that great ladyes shold be lernyd or have enye\r\nknowledge of musike.’ Her wit is good and she will no doubt learn\r\nEnglish soon when she puts her mind to it. ‘I could never hear that she\r\nis inclined to the good cheer of this country and marvel it were if she\r\nshould, seeing that her brother, to whom yet it were somewhat more\r\ntolerable, doth so well abstain from it.’”[380]\r\n\r\nFootnote 380:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 33.\r\n\r\nSir Michael Mercator, the German factor of musical instruments, knighted\r\nby Henry, wrote to Cromwell later in the year, giving praise to God “for\r\nthis alliance with the most illustrious, beautiful, and noble lady Anna\r\nde Clefves, who has a great gift from God, both of sense and wit. It\r\nwould be difficult to describe her good manners and grace, and how\r\nGueldres, Cleves, and all the country of the Duke, rejoice at the\r\nalliance.”[381]\r\n\r\nFootnote 381:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. 500.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE “FLANDERS MARE” LEGEND]\r\n\r\nAround Holbein’s portrait of Anne there has been woven a legend which\r\nupon examination is found to have no foundation in fact. The story is to\r\nbe traced back to Bishop Burnet, who, in his _History of the\r\nReformation_, says:[382] “Hans Holbin having taken her picture, sent it\r\nover to the king. But in that he bestowed the common compliment of his\r\nart somewhat too liberally on a lady that was in a fair way to be queen\r\nthe king liked the picture better than the original, when he had the\r\noccasion afterwards to compare them.” Instead of the promised beauty,\r\ncontinues the bishop, they brought him over a “Flanders mare.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 382:\r\n\r\n  Vol. i. pt. i. p. 543.\r\n\r\nWalpole, following Burnet, elaborates this: “Holbein was next despatched\r\nby Cromwell to draw the lady Anne of Cleve, and by practising the common\r\nflattery of his profession, was the immediate cause of the destruction\r\nof that great subject, and of the disgrace that fell on the princess\r\nherself. He drew so favourable a likeness, that Henry was content to wed\r\nher; but when he found her so inferior to the miniature, the storm which\r\nreally should have been directed at the painter, burst on the minister;\r\nand Cromwell lost his head, because Anne was _a Flanders mare_, not a\r\nVenus, as Holbein had represented her.”[383]\r\n\r\nFootnote 383:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, i. p. 72.\r\n\r\nThere is no truth at all in this story. The leading characteristic of\r\nHolbein’s portraiture is its complete truth; he was not in the habit of\r\nflattering his sitters, and the portrait of Anne affords one of the most\r\nstriking testimonies of this. He certainly did not paint her as a Venus,\r\nnor was Cromwell’s fall owing to the picture. He was, indeed, made Earl\r\nof Essex after the lady’s marriage to the King. Letters in the State\r\nPapers show very clearly that Henry complained only of the spoken and\r\nwritten words of his ambassadors, and made no mention of portraits.\r\nRussell, the Lord High Admiral, in his deposition in connection with the\r\ndivorce, quoted Henry as saying to him: “How like you this woman? do you\r\nthink her so fair and of such beauty as report hath been made unto me of\r\nher? I pray you tell me the truth.” Whereupon the said Lord Admiral\r\nanswered, that he took her not for fair, but to be of a brown\r\ncomplexion. And the king’s highness said, “Alas! whom should men trust?\r\nI promise you,” said he, “I see no such thing in her as hath been showed\r\nme of her, and am ashamed that men hath praised her as they have done,\r\nand I like her not.” Stow, in quoting this, adds without authority the\r\nwords: “either by pictures or report,” after “I see no such thing in her\r\nas hath been showed me of her.”\r\n\r\nStow, apparently drawing upon his own imagination, makes exaggerated\r\nreferences to the part portraits played in the negotiations for the\r\nmarriage. “Some went over by the king, some by the Lord Cromwell, and\r\nsome went voluntary, to view the Lady Anne of Cleave, and to negotiate\r\nher marriage with the king. All which, either by letters, speech, or\r\nboth, made very large and liberal reports in praise of her singular\r\nfeature, matchless beauty, and princely perfections, and for proof\r\nthereof presented the king with sundry of her pictures, which the\r\nbringers ever affirmed to have been truly made, without flattery.”[384]\r\n\r\nFootnote 384:\r\n\r\n  Stow, _Annales_, ed. Howes, p. 576.\r\n\r\nHenry, however, in his own declaration, never refers to a portrait. He\r\nentered into the marriage, he said, “because I heard so much both of her\r\nexcellent beauty and virtuous conditions.” In addition, he told Sir\r\nAnthony Browne, “I see nothing in this woman as men report of her, and I\r\nmervail that wise men would make such report as they have done.” He also\r\ntold Cromwell, in reply to his question as to how he liked the lady,\r\n“Nothing so well as she was spoken of; if I had known as much before as\r\nI know now, she should never have come into the realm. But what remedy?”\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, the praises of her sent home by Henry’s ambassadors\r\nwere not very hearty ones. In Hutton’s letter from Brussels, already\r\nquoted,[385] written shortly after Jane Seymour’s death, in answer to a\r\nrequest that he would search for a possible bride for the King at the\r\nCourt of the Regent, he reported, among other princesses, that “the\r\nDewke of Clevis hathe a daughter, but I here no great preas neyther of\r\nhir personage nor beawtie.” Wootton’s account, given above, is a\r\nremarkably cautious one, and lays most stress on Anne’s domestic\r\nvirtues. He had also complained that he had found it impossible to judge\r\nof the personal appearance of the two ladies on account of the ugly\r\nhead-dresses they wore.\r\n\r\nFootnote 385:\r\n\r\n  See p. 116.\r\n\r\nHad the fault been Holbein’s, he would, no doubt, have fallen under the\r\nKing’s displeasure. At the least his appointment would have been taken\r\nfrom him, even if he had not been forced to leave England; but the\r\ncontrary was the case. In September, after his return from Cleves, he\r\nreceived, for a second time, a whole year’s salary in advance. This was,\r\nof course, before the King had seen the original of the portrait; but,\r\nstrangely enough, if the accounts are to be believed, in addition to\r\nthis year’s advance, Holbein continued to receive his salary every\r\nquarter day for the next year, so that he was paid twice over.[386] It\r\nis thus very evident that the painter suffered no disgrace or lack of\r\nemployment or patronage, so that the legend must be abandoned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 386:\r\n\r\n  See p. 190.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF ANNE OF CLEVES]\r\n\r\nThe fine portrait of Anne of Cleves now in the Louvre (Pl. 24) is in all\r\nprobability the picture which Holbein painted in Düren.[387] It is\r\nalmost three-quarter length, less than life-size. She is shown standing,\r\nfacing the spectator, her hands folded in front of her, and dressed in a\r\nvery elaborate costume. Her sumptuous gown of red velvet with wide\r\nhanging sleeves has heavy bands of gold embroidered with pearls. The\r\nbodice is cut square, and is edged with a band of ornament decorated\r\nwith jewels, and a similar one round the neck with a pendant jewelled\r\ncross. She also wears two gold chains, and several rings on her fingers.\r\nThe open front of the dress is filled in with fine white linen with\r\nbands of embroidery. Her hair is covered with an almost transparent\r\nhead-dress worked with an elaborate pattern and the motto “A BON FINE,”\r\nover which is a cap wrought all over with gold, pearls, and other\r\njewels. Her lace cuffs are also gold-embroidered. The background is\r\nblue-green, without inscription. Her brown eyes look straight at the\r\nspectator. More than one writer, influenced no doubt by these stories of\r\nher lack of beauty, has described this portrait as the likeness of a\r\nheavy, expressionless, ill-favoured woman; but this is far from being\r\nthe case. Without any pretensions to extraordinary good looks, the face\r\nis a pleasant one, and by no means as plain as it has been described;\r\nindeed, in many ways it compares favourably with that of Queen Jane\r\nSeymour. That it is a truthful representation is certain, for Holbein\r\nnever failed in this respect. Nothing is known of the history of the\r\npicture, or how it came to find a home in France, except that it was at\r\none time in the Earl of Arundel’s possession,[388] and afterwards in the\r\ncollection of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nFootnote 387:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 228.

The print among the\r\nillustrious heads is taken from it: and so far justifies the king, that\r\nhe certainly was not nice, if from that picture he concluded her\r\nhandsome enough. It has so little beauty, that I should doubt of its\r\nbeing the very portrait in question—it rather seems to have been drawn\r\nafter Holbein saw a little with the king’s eyes. I have seen that\r\npicture in the cabinet of the present Mr. Barrett, of Lee, and think it\r\nthe most exquisitely perfect of all Holbein’s works as well as in the\r\nhighest preservation. The print gives a very inadequate idea of it, and\r\nnone of her Flemish fairness. It is preserved in the ivory box in which\r\nit came over, and which represents a rose, so delicately carved as to be\r\nworthy of the jewel it contains.”[389]\r\n\r\nFootnote 389:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, i. p. 72, note.\r\n\r\nIt is not known in what way this miniature,[390] together with the\r\ncompanion portrait of Henry VIII,[391] in a similar ivory box, in the\r\nlate Mr. Pierpont Morgan’s collection, came into the possession of the\r\nBarrett family. They were offered for sale by auction in 1757, but\r\nbought in; and subsequently sold by Mr. T. B. Barrett in 1826 to a\r\ndealer named Tuck, who resold them for fifty guineas to Francis Douce,\r\nby whom they were bequeathed, in 1834, to Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, of\r\nGoodrich Court. At a later date the miniature of Anne of Cleves was\r\nbequeathed by General Meyrick to Miss Davies, from whom it was acquired\r\nby the late Mr. George Salting. This miniature follows very closely the\r\nportrait in the Louvre, though there are slight differences in the\r\ndetails and colour of the dress. The background is blue, without\r\ninscription. It is in water-colours, and is 1¾ in. in diameter. It was\r\nfrom this miniature, which is regarded as an undoubted work by Holbein,\r\nthat Houbraken engraved, in 1739, the portrait of Anne for his\r\n“Illustrious Heads.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 390:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 158.

There is a second print by Hollar, of the same year,\r\n  taken from a picture or drawing in the Arundel Collection, of a lady\r\n  in profile to the right, wearing a flat black cap, which, it has been\r\n  suggested, also represents Anne of Cleves (Parthey, 1545). The\r\n  likeness is not very apparent, nor does the original appear to have\r\n  been by Holbein, as Hollar states. It is reproduced by Dr. Ganz,\r\n  _Holbein_, p. 198 (2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 24\r\n  ANNE OF CLEVES\r\n  1539\r\n  LOUVRE, PARIS\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OTHER PORTRAITS OF ANNE OF CLEVES]\r\n\r\nThere are several other portraits in existence which are said, with\r\nlittle authority, to represent Anne of Cleves; among them a drawing in\r\nthe Windsor Collection,[393] which appears at one time to have become\r\nseparated from the others. It came into the possession of Dr. Meade, and\r\nat his sale in 1755 was bought by Mr. Chetwynd. After the latter’s death\r\nit was restored by his executors to the royal collection. It bears\r\nlittle or no resemblance to the Louvre portrait, and is almost certainly\r\na likeness of some English lady. She is shown full-face, with a\r\nclose-fitting cap covering the ears, and a hat over it. The drawing has\r\nbeen damaged by having been cut out round the outline. The face is a\r\nrefined one. There are notes in German as to the material and colours of\r\nthe dress, and the pattern of the Spanish work on the collar is drawn in\r\ndetail on the margin. It has no inscription. In the National Portrait\r\nExhibition at South Kensington in 1865, a small head of “Anne of Cleves”\r\nwas exhibited by the Earl of Derby. It was in oil on panel, oval, about\r\n3 in. by 2½ in., and signed “H. H.” It had been injured, and was then in\r\na somewhat dirty condition; the face had considerable likeness to the\r\nLouvre picture.[394]\r\n\r\nFootnote 393:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 357; Wornum, not included; Holmes, ii. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 394:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 330, note.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one other portrait in addition to the Louvre panel\r\nwhich is a contemporary likeness of Anne of Cleves, though not by\r\nHolbein. This is the small picture in St. John’s College, Oxford, a fine\r\nwork by some unknown painter of the Flemish School. It is a half-length,\r\nstanding three-quarters to the left, behind a parapet upon which lie an\r\norange and a pair of jewelled gloves. The head-dress is of cloth of gold\r\nand white gauze, the latter worked with the motto, “A BON FINE,” as in\r\nthe Louvre picture. She is wearing a low-cut dress of striped gold and\r\nblack, filled in with white with embroidered bands, gold and jewelled\r\nnecklaces, and a pendant cross, and several rings on her fingers. Her\r\nleft hand is placed against her waistbelt, and in her right she holds\r\nthree carnations. The background is dark, with a small canopy or curtain\r\nover her head. It is on panel with arched top, 19¾ in. by 14¼ in. The\r\ncostume is of the same style and period as the Louvre portrait, though\r\nit differs in numerous small details, more particularly in the colours\r\nof the materials, the shape of the sleeves, and the jewelled bands of\r\nthe head-dress. The general tone of colour is golden, and there is\r\nexcellent painting in all the details of the elaborate costume. It was\r\nincluded in the Oxford Exhibition of Historical Portraits in 1904 (No.\r\n30), and was one of the most interesting pictures in the\r\ncollection.[395] As a likeness it bears a strong resemblance to\r\nHolbein’s portrait, and if not of Anne may well be of her sister. The\r\nsuggestion may be hazarded that it is one of the two portraits, painted\r\nsix months before Holbein and Beard were in Düren, which Olisleger had\r\npromised to procure for Henry VIII’s ambassadors, portraits which Beard,\r\napparently, took with him to London early in July 1539.\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in the Oxford Catalogue, p. 24; _Burlington Magazine_, vol.\r\n  v., May 1904, p. 214. A very similar picture was lent by Dr. Wickham\r\n  Flower to the New Gallery Winter Exhibition, 1899-1900, No. 44, as a\r\n  work of the Early Flemish School. It was described in the catalogue\r\n  as: “Half-length, turned towards left, habited in a rich Flemish\r\n  costume of gold tissue covered with jewellery; head-dress ornamented\r\n  with pearls, and inscribed with the motto ‘A bon fine’; in her right\r\n  hand she holds a red carnation; flat green background. Painted on\r\n  vellum and strained on fine canvas, 15 in. × 14 in. This portrait is\r\n  supposed to have been executed by a Flemish painter a year or two\r\n  previous to Anne’s marriage in 1540.”\r\n\r\nThere is no need even to touch upon the concluding stages of this\r\nmiserable story, with which Holbein had nothing to do. Henry married\r\nAnne at Greenwich on January 6, 1540, and finally divorced her on July\r\n12 in the same year. She settled at Richmond in the enjoyment of the\r\nrank of a princess and a pension of £3000 a year, and survived the King\r\nby ten years, dying in 1557.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n                       THE LAST YEARS: 1540-1543\r\n\r\n    Holbein’s work at Whitehall—His residence in the parish of\r\n    St. Andrew Undershaft—In high favour at court—Payments of\r\n    his salary—Possible visit to Basel—Portraits and miniatures\r\n    of Catherine Howard—Portraits of the Duke of Norfolk—The\r\n    Earl of Surrey—Unknown men at Berlin and Vienna—Unknown\r\n    Englishman at the Hague—Earl of Southampton—Unknown man,\r\n    aged 54, at Berlin—Unknown English lady at Vienna—Simon\r\n    George—Dr. John Chamber—Sir William and Lady Butts—Unknown\r\n    Englishman at Basel—Young English lady in the collection of\r\n    Count Lanckoronski—Lady Rich—Holbein’s self-portraits—A\r\n    newly-discovered one at Basel—Portraits, now lost, etched by\r\n    Hollar—The Duke of Buckingham’s Collection.\r\n\r\nThough there is no actual evidence in support of the statement of the\r\nolder writers that Holbein, after he entered the royal service, had the\r\nuse of a permanent studio in Whitehall Palace, granted to him by the\r\nKing, there is every possibility that such was the case. “One of the\r\nearliest of the famous non-royal residents in Whitehall Palace,” says\r\nDr. Edgar Sheppard, “was the artist Holbein. He had been presented to\r\nHenry VIII by Sir Thomas More, and the King assigned him a permanent\r\nsuite of apartments in Whitehall, and commissioned him to paint the\r\ninterior of the new Palace, for which work he received two hundred\r\nflorins per annum.”[396] While the great wall-painting in the Privy\r\nChamber was in progress, it would be necessary for him to have a room\r\nfor his own use within the building, for the storage of the materials\r\nrequired for the work, and it is not impossible that he was permitted to\r\nretain the room as his own, perhaps one of those over the so-called\r\n“Holbein’s Gate,” for the short remainder of his life, more particularly\r\nas his practice was almost entirely confined to the court, so that a\r\nstudio in Whitehall would best suit the convenience both of the painter\r\nand his sitters.[397] That he had a “permanent suite of apartments”\r\nthere, as Dr. Sheppard states, is much less probable. This would\r\nindicate residence, whereas it is known that during his last years he\r\noccupied a house in the east of London.\r\n\r\nFootnote 396:\r\n\r\n  _The Old Royal Palace of Whitehall_, 1901, p. 266.\r\n\r\nFootnote 397:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix (M).\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, too, whether Holbein carried out any important\r\ndecorative work in the Palace beyond the famous wall-painting already\r\ndescribed.[398] According to a curious entry in Pepys’ _Diary_, under\r\nthe date August 28, 1668, which is not easy to understand, the room\r\nknown as the Matted Gallery had a painted ceiling of Holbein’s\r\nhandiwork. The passage runs as follows: “With much difficulty, by\r\ncandle-light, walked over the matted gallery, as it is now with the mats\r\nand boards all taken up, so that we walked over the rafters. But strange\r\nto see how hard matter the plaister of Paris is, that is there taken up,\r\nas hard as stone! And pity to see Holben’s work in the ceiling blotted\r\non, and only whited over!” The exact sense of the concluding words is\r\nnot very clear, but Pepys appears to mean that the ceiling had been\r\nformerly painted by Holbein, and that, having become damaged in course\r\nof time, it had recently been given a coat of whitewash. The ceiling was\r\nprobably decorated with coloured plaster-work in relief, and though\r\nHolbein may have supplied the design, and may even have been responsible\r\nfor the painting, it is much more likely that the plaster-work itself\r\nwas done by some Italian, such as Nicolas Beilin of Modena, who had\r\ncarried out similar undertakings at Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nFootnote 398:\r\n\r\n  In 1576 Johann Fischart, quoted by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. xxxviii., in a\r\n  description of the Palace, speaks of several of the galleries as\r\n  decorated on both sides with fine emblematic histories, and actions\r\n  and stories in the style of Michelangelo and Holbein. Henry Peacham,\r\n  in his _Graphicè_ (1606), and again in _The Compleat Gentleman_\r\n  (1634), speaks of works by Holbein in Whitehall. He says: “He painted\r\n  the Chappell at White-Hall, and S. _James_, _Joseph of Arimathea_,\r\n  _Lazarus_ rising from the dead, &c., were his.” (See _The Compleat\r\n  Gentleman_, ed. G. S. Gordon, 1906, p. 128. Also Walpole, _Anecdotes_,\r\n  ed. Wornum, i. p. 82.) There is a drawing in the British Museum\r\n  representing Henry VIII seated at table under a lofty canopy, in a\r\n  large chamber, with a number of standing courtiers in attendance,\r\n  which appears to be a sixteenth-century copy of a preliminary study by\r\n  Holbein for a wall-decoration, possibly for one of the rooms in\r\n  Whitehall. It is inscribed “Holbein Inven^t.” Reproduced by Ganz,\r\n  _Holbein_, p. 183.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “DANCE OF DEATH” AT WHITEHALL]\r\n\r\nThe legend that Holbein also painted a “Dance of Death,” composed of\r\nlife-size figures, upon the walls of one of the rooms in Whitehall, is\r\nprobably pure fiction, or, at least, there is much less to be said in\r\nits favour than for Pepys’ attribution of the ceiling in the Matted\r\nGallery to the painter. The writer who first gave currency to the story\r\nwas Francis Douce, in his “Dance of Death,” published in 1833. According\r\nto his statement, “very soon after the calamitous fire at Whitehall in\r\n1697,[399] which consumed nearly the whole of that palace, a person,\r\ncalling himself T. Nieuhoff Piccard, probably belonging to the household\r\nof William III, and a man who appears to have been an amateur\r\nartist,”[400] made etchings after nineteen of the cuts in the Lyon\r\n“Dance of Death.” Impressions of these etchings, accompanied with\r\nmanuscript dedications, are said to have been presented by this Piccard\r\nto his friends and patrons, and among others to a Mynheer Heymans, and\r\nto the “high, noble, and well-born Lord William Denting, Lord of Rhoon,\r\nPendreght,” &c. In these addresses Piccard speaks of a “wall-painting”\r\nof the “Dance” by Holbein which he himself had seen in Whitehall. In the\r\ndedication to Heymans he says:\r\n\r\nFootnote 399:\r\n\r\n  Should be 1698.\r\n\r\nFootnote 400:\r\n\r\n  _Holbein’s Dance of Death_, ed. 1858, p. 124.\r\n\r\n    “Sir,—The costly palace of Whitehall, erected by Cardinal\r\n    Wolsey, and the residence of King Henry VIII, contains, among\r\n    other performances of art, a _Dance of Death_, painted by\r\n    Holbein in its galleries, which, through an unfortunate\r\n    conflagration, has been reduced to ashes.”\r\n\r\nIn the dedication to “Lord William Benting” Piccard is more precise:\r\n\r\n    “Sir,—In the course of my constant love and pursuit of works of\r\n    art, it has been my good fortune to meet with that scarce little\r\n    work of Hans Holbein neatly engraved on wood, and which he\r\n    himself had painted as large as life in fresco on the walls of\r\n    Whitehall.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs far as can be ascertained, there is not the slightest truth in this\r\nlegend. Nothing is known as to the identity of Heymans, but Lord William\r\nBenting was evidently William Bentinck (1704-1774), of Rhoon and\r\nPendrecht in Holland, and Terrington St. Clements, Norfolk, third son of\r\nHans William Bentinck, first Earl of Portland, and a Count of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire. Douce, who gave undeserved authority to this story, made\r\nno attempt to trace the history of the manuscript “addresses” which\r\naccompanied the etchings, and though he saw them, does not say to whom\r\nthey then belonged, or even in what language they were written. They may\r\nbe safely set down as forgeries, as far as any wall-paintings of the\r\n“Dance of Death” by Holbein are concerned. Piccard, whoever he may have\r\nbeen, is the sole authority for the existence of these mythical works,\r\nwhich are not mentioned by Van Mander or Sandrart, or by any of the\r\nforeign travellers who visited this country in their descriptions of\r\nWhitehall, though the wall-painting of Henry VIII with his wife and\r\nparents in the same palace is more than once spoken of in such records\r\nin terms of high praise. Both Pepys and Evelyn are equally silent on the\r\nsubject, though the latter mentions the “Dance of Death” woodcuts, and\r\nascribes them to Holbein by name. “We have seen,” he says, “some few\r\nthings cut in wood by the incomparable Hans Holbein the Dane, but they\r\nare rare and exceedingly difficult to come by; as his _Licentiousnesse\r\nof the Friers and Nuns_; _Erasmus_; _Moriae Encomium_; _the Trial and\r\nCrucifixion of Christ_; _The Daunce Macchabree_; the _Mortis Imago_,\r\nwhich he painted in great in the Church at Basil, and afterwards graved\r\nwith no lesse art.”[401] What he says is by no means free from mistakes,\r\nbut as, in speaking of a visit paid to Whitehall in 1656, he describes\r\nthe condition of the large wall-painting of the two kings Henry VII and\r\nHenry VIII, and their consorts, it is not probable that he would have\r\nfailed to mention any other important wall-paintings in the palace had\r\nthey existed. Douce thought he had discovered a corroboration of\r\nPiccard’s story in an entry in Van der Doort’s catalogue of Charles I’s\r\ncollection, which runs: “A little piece, where Death with a green\r\ngarland about his head, stretching both his arms to apprehend a Pilate\r\nin the habit of one of the spiritual Prince-Electors of Germany. Copied\r\nby Isaac Oliver from Holbein”; but this, no doubt, was painted from the\r\nwoodcut of the Elector in the Lyon “Dance of Death,” and not from a\r\nlarge wall-painting.\r\n\r\nFootnote 401:\r\n\r\n  Evelyn, _Sculptura_, ed. 1769, p. 69.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, though Holbein may have had a workroom within the\r\nprecincts of Whitehall, his permanent home in London was elsewhere. The\r\npublic records show that in 1541 he was living in the parish of St.\r\nAndrew Undershaft, in Aldgate Ward. How long he had been there is not\r\nknown, but possibly for the greater part of his second sojourn in\r\nEngland. This information is contained in a subsidy roll for the City of\r\nLondon, dated 24th October, 33 Hen. VIII (1541). Among the “straungers”\r\ntaxed were:\r\n\r\n                    “Barnadyne      xxx. _s._\r\n                    Buttessey, xxx.\r\n                    _li._\r\n\r\n                     Hanns Holbene  iij. _li._”\r\n                    in fee, xxx.\r\n                    _li._\r\n\r\nWhy Holbein was obliged to pay twice the amount charged to Buttessey on\r\nan equal assessment of £30 a year is explained by the fact that in these\r\nsubsidies it was usual to tax “lands, fees, and annuities,” at double\r\nthe rate of goods. “In the royal accounts,” says Sir Augustus W. Franks,\r\n“the payments to Holbein are sometimes noticed as wages, sometimes as an\r\nannuity; while other payments of a similar kind, although fees or\r\nannuities, are included under the general term “wages,” and evidently\r\nlooked upon as synonymous terms for the salaries paid by the King to\r\nvarious members of his household. In any case, the salary of Holbein,\r\nthe painter, rendered him liable to be rated, as a foreigner, at the\r\nhigh amount above-mentioned.”[402] There can be no doubt that this\r\nHolbein of the subsidy roll was the artist. The amount of his fee, £30,\r\ncorresponds with the salary he received from the royal purse, while\r\nHolbein’s will gives his place of residence as the parish of St. Andrew\r\nUndershaft.\r\n\r\nFootnote 402:\r\n\r\n  _Archæologia_, vol. xxxix. p. 17.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN’S RESIDENCE IN LONDON]\r\n\r\nAccording to a story told by Walpole, Holbein once resided in a house on\r\nLondon Bridge. He says: “The father of Lord Treasurer Oxford passing\r\nover London Bridge, was caught in a shower, and stepping into a\r\ngoldsmith’s shop for shelter, he found there a picture of Holbein (who\r\nhad lived in that house) and his family. He offered the goldsmith\r\n100_l._ for it, who consented to let him have it, but desired first to\r\nshow it to some persons. Immediately after happened the fire of London,\r\nand the picture was destroyed.”[403] This story is apparently a mere\r\nlegend, and there is no evidence to support it; nor is it very probable\r\nthat an important painting by Holbein would have remained in the same\r\nsmall house for more than one hundred and twenty years. Dallaway, in his\r\nnotes to Walpole, includes in a supplementary list of works by Holbein\r\nin England a small picture of Holbein, his wife, four boys, and a girl,\r\nat Mereworth Castle, Kent, which he suggests may be either a repetition\r\nor the original picture of the London Bridge story; but in the first\r\nplace, Holbein never had a family of four sons, and, secondly, the\r\npicture bears no traces of Holbein’s manner. He quotes Gilpin’s\r\ndescription of it: “As a whole, it has no effect; but the heads are\r\nexcellent. They are not painted in the common flat style of Holbein, but\r\nwith a round, firm, glowing pencil, and yet exact imitation of nature is\r\npreserved—the boys are very innocent, beautiful characters.” If some\r\nsuch “family” picture existed in London at that time, it is much more\r\nlikely to have been a copy or a replica of the genuine family group in\r\nthe Basel Gallery.\r\n\r\nFootnote 403:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, i. p. 86, note.\r\n\r\nThe favour with which Holbein was now regarded at court is shown by the\r\nfrequency with which he received a year’s or half a year’s salary in\r\nadvance, a mark of royal condescension which was most unusual. Thus\r\nunder “September A^o xxxi” (1539) is the following entry: “Item paide by\r\nthe Kingis highnesse commaundement certefied by my lorde privyseales\r\nlettres to Hans Holbenne, paynter, in the advauncement of his hole yeres\r\nwagis beforehande, aftre the rate of xxx _li._ by yere, which yeres\r\nadvauncement is to be accompted from this present Michaelmas, and shall\r\nende ultimo Septembris next commynge, the somme of xxx _li._”[404]\r\nNotwithstanding this payment in advance, it appears, as already pointed\r\nout,[405] from the four following quarterly entries in the accounts\r\nhaving reference to Holbein, from Michaelmas 1539 to Midsummer 1540,\r\nthat he continued to receive his salary of £7, 10_s._ each quarter as\r\nusual.[406] If these entries are to be depended upon, he clearly\r\nreceived his money twice over, either by accident, owing to carelessness\r\nin the keeping of the King’s accounts, or of set purpose as a further\r\nreward for his services.\r\n\r\nFootnote 404:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv. pt. ii. p. 313, _The King’s Payments_, f. 90 _b_;\r\n  and _Archæologia_, vol. xxxix. p. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 405:\r\n\r\n  See p. 180.\r\n\r\nFootnote 406:\r\n\r\n  The first of these was due to him, and not covered by the year’s\r\n  advance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS WORK ABOUT THE COURT]\r\n\r\nIn September 1540 he received an advance of half a year: “September, A^o\r\nxxxii—Item paide to Hans Holbyn, the Kingis paynter, in advauncement of\r\nhis wagis for one half yere beforehande, the same half yere accompted\r\nand reconned fromme Michaelmas last paste, the somme of xv _li._” This\r\ntime, however, he did not receive his salary twice over, for in the two\r\nfollowing entries, at Michaelmas and Christmas, 1540, the accounts\r\nmerely state: “Item, for Hans Holbyn, paynter, wages, nihil, quia prius\r\nper warrantum.” In the following March 1541 he again obtained a\r\nhalf-year’s advance: “March, A^o xxxii: Item paied to Hans Holben, the\r\nKingis painter, in advauncement of his half yeres wages before hande,\r\nafter the rate of xxx _li._ by yere, which half yere is accompted to\r\nbeginne primo Aprilis A^o xxxij. domini Regis nunc, and shall ende\r\nultimo Septembris then next ensuynge, the somme of xv _li._” The two\r\nremaining entries of which we have record, at Lady Day and Midsummer\r\nfollowing, are as follows: “Item for Hans Holben, paynter, wages, nil,\r\nquia praemanibus”; and “Item for Hans Holbyn, paynter, nihil, quia\r\nprius.” The volume of accounts closes with the payments for this\r\nquarter, and no details of the royal expenditure during the next two\r\nyears and a half exist, so that there is no record of the salary Holbein\r\nreceived for the remaining years of his life. In a later volume of\r\nTuke’s accounts, as treasurer of the household, extending from October,\r\n35 Hen. VIII (1543) to November, 36 Hen. VIII (1544), the first\r\nquarterly payments are for Christmas 1543, and Holbein’s name does not\r\noccur in them, as he had then been dead for about two months. It is\r\nrather strange, however, that it does not appear among the Christmas\r\npayments with “Nihil quia mortuus” after it, as this was the usual\r\nprocedure in case of death. This omission, however, may have been due to\r\nthe fact that he had once again received his salary beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe remaining years of Holbein’s life must have been busy ones, judging\r\nfrom the number of preliminary studies for portraits of the men and\r\nwomen of Henry’s court which exist in the Windsor Collection and in many\r\nof the great European museums. These drawings are all undated, and cover\r\nthe whole period of his English career, but there are so many of them\r\nthat his time must have been always fully occupied. It is strange,\r\ntherefore, that so few of his finished portraits can be ascribed with\r\nany certainty to the year 1540. Although it was by no means his\r\ninvariable custom to put the date on his paintings, yet this was his\r\nmore usual practice, and there is no known picture by him which is\r\ninscribed 1540, though there are a few dated 1541 and 1542. Several\r\nportraits of the Howard family can be given with some certainty to the\r\nearlier year, but beyond this nothing has been so far discovered. It may\r\nbe suggested, as some explanation of this, that Holbein paid another\r\nvisit to Basel during the last quarter of 1540, as the two years’ leave\r\nof absence granted him by the Town Council came to an end in the middle\r\nof October. The Council, who had been paying his wife the promised\r\nyearly pension of forty gulden, expected him to make Basel his permanent\r\nresidence on the completion of this further extension of leave. The\r\nterms of their agreement with him were fairly generous, and it is not to\r\nbe supposed that the painter would risk losing his rights of citizenship\r\nand the stoppage of the pension to his wife through a total disregard of\r\nthe Council’s wish. It seems possible, therefore, that he went over to\r\nSwitzerland in order to make personal application for a further and\r\nlonger leave of absence in England than the agreement of 1538 permitted.\r\nUnlike many of the foreign artists and artificers then resident in this\r\ncountry, he never became a naturalised British subject, and this, no\r\ndoubt, was due to the fact that he was determined to end his days as a\r\ncitizen of Basel, and regarded his residence here as merely a temporary\r\none, and England as a profitable field which, as time passed, would\r\nbecome worked out. He could not, of course, foresee that he was to be\r\nsuddenly cut down when a comparatively young man and still in the full\r\nmaturity of his powers. At Michaelmas in the year in question he\r\nreceived half a year’s salary in advance, so that it was impossible for\r\nhim to leave England permanently for some time to come.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1540 Holbein lost another of his English patrons. Henry\r\nformally divorced Anne of Cleves on the 12th of July, and on the 28th of\r\nthe same month Thomas Cromwell, then Earl of Essex, who had been a good\r\nfriend to the painter, was beheaded for high treason, after a period of\r\neight years during which his influence with both King and Parliament had\r\nbeen paramount. During the same month Henry privately married Catherine,\r\ndaughter of Lord Edmund Howard, a cousin of Anne Boleyn, and niece of\r\nThomas, third Duke of Norfolk. By this marriage the Howards, and through\r\nthem the Catholic party, regained that ascendancy in the councils of the\r\nKing which had received a severe check at the fall of Anne Boleyn; and\r\nat least three members of this family were painted by Holbein. The new\r\nQueen was publicly acknowledged on August 8 at Hampton Court Palace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINIATURES OF CATHERINE HOWARD]\r\n\r\nAlthough it was to be supposed that Henry would employ Holbein to paint\r\nthe portrait of his new queen, until quite recently the only known\r\nlikeness of her from his brush was the miniature portrait in the royal\r\ncollection at Windsor Castle, and the replica of it belonging to the\r\nDuke of Buccleuch. In 1909, however, the discovery was made by Mr.\r\nLionel Cust of a genuine and very beautiful portrait of this Queen. In\r\nthe Windsor miniature (Pl. 31 (4)),[407] which shows her in a similar\r\nposition to the one in the newly-discovered picture, she is represented\r\nnearly to the waist, turned to the left, her hands folded in front of\r\nher, the left over the right. Her hair and eyes are brown, and she wears\r\na circular hood of the then fashionable French pattern, with a fall of\r\nblack velvet. Her square-cut bodice is of dark cloth of gold, with\r\nsleeves of grey-green silk embroidered with gold, and white ruffles with\r\nblack embroidery. Round her neck, over the white cambric filling of the\r\ndress, falls an elaborate necklace of pearls, rubies, and sapphires. The\r\nbackground, which is bright blue, has no inscription. It is painted on\r\nthe back of a playing card, the eight of diamonds, and is 2⅓ inches in\r\ndiameter. The hands, and the lower part of the arms, are badly painted,\r\nand appear to be a later addition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 407:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 271. Reproduced by Law, Pl. vii.; Knackfuss, fig. 132;\r\n  Williamson, _History of Portrait Miniatures_, Pl. ii. No. 2; Pollard,\r\n  _Henry VIII_, p. 245; Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 149 (4), and Cust,\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, July 1910, p. 195.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of its history, or as to the date of its acquisition,\r\nbut it did not belong to the Crown in Tudor or Stuart days. Dr. Ganz\r\ndescribes it as badly over-painted, and possibly only a copy. Doubts\r\nhave been thrown from time to time on its right to be called a portrait\r\nof Catherine Howard. Mr. Ernest Law considers the attribution to be\r\n“very problematical indeed,” and states that it “does not at all accord\r\nwith the Holbein drawing inscribed as ‘Queen Katherine Howard.’”[408] In\r\nthis he follows earlier writers. Nichols says that though the position\r\nand head-dress of the drawing agree with the miniature, “the features do\r\nnot appear to correspond.”[409] It is difficult, however, to agree with\r\nthem in this, for a careful comparison of the two makes it quite evident\r\nthat they represent the same lady. The version belonging to the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch is almost identical with the Windsor miniature, but is a\r\nbetter work and slightly smaller, being only two inches in diameter. It\r\nwas last publicly exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, in\r\n1909.[410] It was formerly in the collection of the Earl of Arundel, and\r\nwhen there was etched by Hollar in 1646. It was afterwards owned by\r\nJonathan Richardson the younger (1694-1771), and subsequently by Horace\r\nWalpole. Walpole describes it as: “Catherine Howard, a miniature,\r\ndamaged, it was Richardson’s, who bought it out of the Arundelian\r\ncollection. It is engraved among the Illustrious Heads [of Houbraken];\r\nand by Hollar, who called it Mary, Queen of France, wife of Charles\r\nBrandon, Duke of Suffolk.”[411] In this he is wrong, for no name is\r\nattached to it in Hollar’s etching, and it was first identified as\r\nCatherine Howard by Mr. Cust. In his _Description of Strawberry Hill_,\r\nhowever, Walpole calls it merely “a lady painted by Holbein,” and says\r\nthat it is “probably Mary Tudor, Queen of France, sister of Henry VIII,\r\nbut among the Illustrious Heads called Catherine Howard.” According to\r\nGranger, it was Vertue who first named it Mary, Queen of France. The\r\nDuke of Buccleuch also possesses a small oil painting on panel, 5⅜ in. ×\r\n4½ in., which was likewise at the Burlington Fine Arts Club (Case C,\r\n24). It is inscribed, by a hand later than that of the painter of the\r\nportrait, “Catherine Howard Henry VIII.” According to Scharf, this is\r\n“apparently a French work, and, indeed, thoroughly so in personal\r\ncharacteristics.”[412] It is in the style of Clouet, and the compilers\r\nof the Burlington Fine Arts Club catalogue suggest that it may represent\r\nAnne de Pisseleu, Duchesse d’Estampes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 408:\r\n\r\n  Law, _Holbein’s Pictures_, &c., p. 24.

The dress, however, in\r\nHolbein’s usual fashion, is merely indicated with a few lines, showing a\r\nplain bodice cut square, filled in with white cambric, with a\r\ndiamond-shaped opening revealing neck and bosom. It agrees in the same\r\nway with the newly-discovered portrait, of which, though reversed, it is\r\nevidently one of the preliminary studies. The identity with Catherine\r\nHoward is further proved, as Mr. Lionel Cust points out, by the family\r\nresemblance, plainly visible, in certain of the features, such as the\r\nover-accentuated lower jaw, to the portraits of her uncle, the Duke of\r\nNorfolk, and of his son, the ill-fated Earl of Surrey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 413:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 329; Wornum, ii. 9; Holmes, i. 42.

The excellence of the\r\npainting of the hands, and of the details of the dress and jewels, led\r\nat first to the supposition that it might be a genuine work by Holbein\r\nwhich had undergone some damage and restoration, but closer examination\r\nproved that it was merely a careful contemporary school copy, or\r\nrepetition of some lost original. It is inscribed “ETATIS SVÆ 21,” which\r\ncorresponds with the known facts of Catherine Howard’s life. In the\r\nsummer of 1909 the original picture of which it is a copy was submitted\r\nto Mr. Cust, who recognised it at once as not only a portrait of\r\nCatherine Howard, but as most possibly a genuine work of the great\r\nmaster, which proved to be the case on the removal of much dirty varnish\r\nand some repaints.[415] It came from a private collection in the west of\r\nEngland, where it had formed part of a series of historical portraits\r\nwhich had been in the possession of the same family for several\r\ngenerations, and had been regarded at one time as a portrait of Eleanor\r\nBrandon, Countess of Cumberland, and at another as Princess Mary Tudor.\r\nIt is now in Canada, in the collection of Mr. James H. Dunn.\r\n\r\nFootnote 414:\r\n\r\n  No. 1119.

The hands are in the same position as in the\r\nminiature, though the fingers are more closely interlaced. Her hair is\r\nauburn, parted in the middle, and the eyes are blue-grey. She wears,\r\ntoo, a costume of a similar fashion, though of different materials. The\r\ncircular French hood, with its heavy band of gold ornament and black\r\nfall, appears to be the same, but the dress is of black satin, with a\r\nsquare black velvet yoke across the bosom, open at the neck and turned\r\nback to show the white lining. A band or piping of gold ornament\r\nelaborately pierced, with pairs of gold tags at intervals, runs along\r\nthe outer seam of the sleeves from shoulder to wrist, and the white\r\nruffles are embroidered all over with a floral design in black. The\r\nornaments she wears are of exceptional interest, as they afford actual\r\nevidence that Holbein not only painted portraits of royal ladies, but\r\nalso designed their jewellery. Round her neck is a small necklace, set\r\nwith pearls and diamonds, less heavy and elaborate than the one\r\nrepresented in the miniatures, and of greater beauty and delicacy of\r\ndesign, to which a large pendant jewel is attached. At her breast is a\r\nbrooch from which hangs a circular jewel or medallion of chased gold\r\nwork, with a large oblong diamond in the centre, on which is represented\r\nthe story of Lot’s wife and the flight from Sodom. This jewel was\r\ndesigned for Catherine by Holbein. It corresponds exactly, as Mr. Cust\r\npoints out, with a most characteristic study, a small roundel placed\r\nwithin an octagon, among the wonderful series of Holbein’s original\r\ndrawings for jewellery in the Print Room of the British Museum,[416] and\r\nthus gives particular interest to a portrait which in all ways forms a\r\nvery important addition to the master’s work, both on account of the\r\nbrilliance of its execution and of its value as an historical document.\r\nSuspended from a chain round her waist hangs a still larger circular\r\njewel, only the upper part of which is seen. That portion of the subject\r\nwhich is visible represents two angels with hands raised in adoration on\r\neither side of a crowned and bearded figure, most possibly the Almighty.\r\nThe background of the portrait is a plain one, of Holbein’s favourite\r\nblue, across which is inscribed, as in the National Portrait Gallery\r\ncopy, “ETATIS SVÆ 21,” on either side of the head. It is on an oak panel\r\n29 inches high by 20 inches wide. It must have been painted between\r\nAugust 1540, the date of her marriage, and November 1541, when she was\r\ndeprived of her dignity as Queen, and forbidden to wear jewels; most\r\nprobably in the latter year, according to Mr. Cust, which would\r\ncorrespond with her accepted age at the time of her marriage. Its\r\nimportance and its genuineness have been accepted by such leading\r\nauthorities as Dr. Bode, Dr. Friedländer, Dr. Paul Ganz, and Sir Sidney\r\nColvin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 416:\r\n\r\n  British Museum Catalogue, 35(E) Vol. ii. p. 339. Reproduced in\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xvii., July 1910, p. 195. See p. 283 and\r\n  Pl. 50 (2).\r\n\r\nCatherine Howard’s reign as Queen of England was a short one. There is\r\nno need to describe her tragic fate in detail. Before the close of the\r\nyear 1541 it was discovered that not only had she had two lovers, one of\r\nthem her cousin Francis Dereham, before her marriage, but that she had\r\nalso been unfaithful to the King almost from the beginning of her\r\nmarried life, her paramour being one of her gentlemen, Thomas Culpeper.\r\nThe Queen and her accomplice, Lady Rochford, were confined in Syon\r\nHouse, pending a parliamentary inquiry. Dereham and Culpeper were tried\r\nat Guildhall in December, pleaded guilty, and were hanged at Tyburn\r\ntwelve days afterwards; and in February 1542, Catherine and Lady\r\nRochford were condemned to death, and were beheaded on the 13th of the\r\nmonth, on the same spot on which the Queen’s cousin, Anne Boleyn, had\r\nsuffered the same penalty for the same crime.\r\n\r\nThis fresh tragedy in his life greatly aged the King, as can be seen in\r\nthe portraits of him painted about this period, usually attributed to\r\nLucas Hornebolt. A month after the execution, Marillac wrote to Francis\r\nI, on March 17, 1542, that Henry was “already very stout and daily\r\ngrowing heavier, much resembling his maternal grandfather, King Edward,\r\nbeing about his age, in loving rest and fleeing trouble. He seems very\r\nold and grey since the mishap (_malheur_) of this last queen, and will\r\nnot yet hear of taking another, although he is ordinarily in company of\r\nladies, and his ministers beg and urge him to marry again.”[417]\r\n\r\nFootnote 417:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xvii. 178.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF THOMAS HOWARD]\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Thomas Howard, third Duke of Norfolk, uncle by marriage\r\nto Henry VIII, was painted at about the same time as that of Catherine\r\nHoward. The inscriptions on the fine original version by Holbein in\r\nWindsor Castle (Pl. 25),[418] and the excellent contemporary copy in\r\nArundel Castle, both state that it was taken in his sixty-sixth year,\r\nand as he is said to have been born in 1473, this gives the date of the\r\npicture as 1539 or early in 1540. He is shown standing, at half-length,\r\nslightly turned to the left. He is wearing a doublet of dusky red silk,\r\nedged with brown fur, and a white collar embroidered with black silk.\r\nHis outer robe of dark velvet has a deep collar and border of ermine,\r\nand on his head is a plain, flat black hat, without a badge, over a\r\nblack skull-cap which covers the ears. In his left hand he holds the\r\nlong white wand of his office of Lord High Treasurer, and in his right\r\nthe shorter gold baton, tipped with black, which he carried as\r\nhereditary Earl Marshal of England. Across the shoulders hangs the\r\nmagnificent and richly-jewelled collar of the Order of the Garter with\r\nthe pendant George, which is painted with all Holbein’s wonderful\r\nmastery in the clear rendering of minute ornament. The face,\r\nclean-shaven, and of a brown complexion, displays remarkable subtlety in\r\nthe delineation of a proud and cruel nature. The cold, unflinching eyes,\r\nthe thin, compressed lips with their faint, ironic smile, and the bony\r\nhands clasping the staves, reveal the sitter’s true character as it has\r\ncome down to us in the pages of history, pride of race, cruelty almost\r\nremorseless in its pursuit of power, and inflexibility of purpose both\r\nin personal aggrandisement and in the service of his royal master.\r\n\r\nFootnote 418:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 267.

This, as already stated, gives the date of the portrait as\r\nabout 1540. The inscription, however, is not contemporary, but was\r\nprobably added some hundred years later, in the reign of Charles I, when\r\nthe picture was in the collection of the Earl of Arundel. It was finely\r\netched by Vorsterman when in the Earl’s possession, in 1630, though\r\nwithout the inscription, but beneath the plate is engraved: “Hans\r\nHolbein pinxit. Visitur in Ædibus Arondelianis Londini.” This does not\r\nnecessarily prove that the inscription on the panel did not exist at\r\nthat date, as Vorsterman may have omitted it as disfiguring. That it was\r\ncertainly there fifteen years later is proved by a coloured drawing on\r\nvellum by Philip Fruytiers, the Antwerp painter, dated 1645, a copy of a\r\nstudy by Van Dyck representing a large group of Thomas Howard, Earl of\r\nArundel, his wife, and family. On the wall in the background Van Dyck\r\nhad inserted, and Fruytiers has copied, on the one side, this very\r\nportrait of the Duke of Norfolk by Holbein, in which the inscription\r\nacross the top of it in gold letters can be plainly seen, and on the\r\nother side the portrait of his son, the Earl of Surrey, also evidently a\r\nwork by Holbein, though the original painting is now lost, which is\r\ninscribed: “HENRY HOWARD ERLE OF SUHRY ANNO ÆTATIS SVÆ 25.” This\r\nwater-colour drawing, which is signed “An. Vandyke inv. Ph. Fruytiers\r\nfecit 1645,” is in the collection of the Duke of Sutherland, and there\r\nis a small copy of it in oils on copper at Norfolk House, which also\r\nshows the inscription. It was engraved by Vertue in 1743. The original\r\nsketch or composition by Van Dyck has been lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL.

That\r\ncollection was divided in 1686, and the share which fell to the Duke of\r\nNorfolk may possibly have contained this portrait of his ancestor.[419]\r\nThe Duke’s pictures were sold in 1692, and nothing further is to be\r\nheard of this portrait until it is mentioned by Walpole as being then\r\n(1762) in Leicester House, at that time the dower-house of the Dowager\r\nPrincess of Wales, widow of Frederick, Prince of Wales.[420] “There can\r\nbe no doubt,” says Mr. Ernest Law, “that the picture passed, on the\r\ndeath of the Princess in 1772, into the possession of the Crown with the\r\nrest of the collection which had been formed by Prince Frederick.”[421]\r\nIt is not known from whom that Prince acquired it, but many of his\r\npictures were purchased for him on the Continent by his agent, Bagnols,\r\nand it is not unlikely that Woltmann’s surmise is correct, and that it\r\nis to be identified with the portrait of the Duke which appeared in the\r\ncatalogue of an anonymous sale of pictures at Amsterdam on April 23,\r\n1732, as “Een zeer konstig uitmuntent stuk door Hans Holbeen, zynde de\r\nHartog van Nortfolk nooit zoo goet gezien,” which must have been a fine\r\nwork, as it fetched the relatively high price of 1120 florins.[422] It\r\nis quite possible, therefore, that the portrait was one of those sold by\r\nLord Stafford in Amsterdam in 1654, immediately after the death of the\r\nCountess of Arundel, and that it was never in the possession of the Duke\r\nof Norfolk, but remained in that town until 1732.\r\n\r\nFootnote 419:\r\n\r\n  The only portrait of the Duke mentioned in the Arundel inventory of\r\n  1655 has no artist’s name placed against it, but it comes next to the\r\n  portrait of the Earl of Surrey, which is given to Holbein. It is\r\n  entered as “Ritratto de Tomaso Howard, Ducha de Nordfolk.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 420:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, &c., ed.

The Arundel picture is slightly the\r\nsmaller, and was last exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1909\r\n(No. 49). There is a second version of this portrait in the Norfolk\r\ncollection, at Norfolk House, in which various alterations have been\r\nmade in the position and the dress, and a more elaborate background has\r\nbeen added. It is a work of comparatively little merit, and appears to\r\nhave been painted during the seventeenth century by some inferior\r\nartist.\r\n\r\nAt the time he sat to Holbein the Duke was at the height of his power.\r\nHe had been the bitter enemy of both Wolsey and Cromwell, and had\r\nassisted to bring about the downfall of both, and had arrested the\r\nlatter with his own hands. After Cromwell’s execution he became the most\r\npowerful of Henry’s subjects, and reached his highest summit of\r\ngreatness. His influence over the King, however, waned after the fall of\r\nhis niece, Catherine Howard, when he was supplanted by his enemies, the\r\nEarl of Hertford and the Seymours. In 1546 he was attainted, together\r\nwith his son, the Earl of Surrey, for high treason, and only escaped the\r\nlatter’s fate by the death of the King on the day the warrant for his\r\nexecution was made out. He remained in the Tower throughout the reign of\r\nEdward VI, but was released on the accession of Queen Mary in 1553, and\r\nhis titles and estates were restored to him, but he only lived to enjoy\r\nthem for a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 26\r\n  HENRY HOWARD, EARL OF SURREY\r\n  Wrongly inscribed “Thomas Howard”\r\n  _Drawing in black and coloured chalks_\r\n  WINDSOR CASTLE\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAITS OF HENRY HOWARD]\r\n\r\nThat Holbein painted his son, Henry, Earl of Surrey, is proved by the\r\nsmall portrait on the wall in Fruytiers’ version of Van Dyck’s picture\r\nof the Arundel family. The inscription on this miniature copy gives his\r\nage as twenty-five; and as he was born about 1517, Holbein must have\r\npainted him about 1541. He is represented with reddish hair and beard,\r\nand brown eyes, the head slightly turned to the right, and wears a black\r\ncap with a feather, and a black mantle from the folds of which the right\r\nhand appears. There is a small drawing in the Windsor Collection wrongly\r\ninscribed “Tho. Howard E. of Surrey,”[423] which bears some likeness to\r\nthe Earl in the Fruytiers drawing, and is supposed to represent Henry\r\nHoward. It is badly rubbed, and has suffered from retouching and certain\r\ncoarse alterations, and has the slightly-wavering touch which marks the\r\nso-called “Melanchthon” in the same collection. It is apparently the\r\noriginal study for the portrait which was engraved by Hollar when it was\r\nin the Arundel Collection.[424] There are two other heads at Windsor\r\nalso named Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, but the attribution cannot be\r\ncorrect, as Surrey’s son, Thomas, was a small boy of only six or seven\r\nat the time of Holbein’s death. Whether the drawings represent the poet\r\nhimself is also doubtful. One of them, inscribed “Thomas Earl of Surry”\r\n(Pl. 26),[425] in which he is shown full-face, clean-shaven, with hair\r\ncut straight across the forehead and partly covering the ears, and\r\nwearing a black cap with scalloped edges and an ostrich feather, is one\r\nof the finest drawings in the whole collection, conspicuous for the\r\ndelicacy of the modelling and the freedom and expressiveness of the\r\ndraughtsmanship. The face is one of considerable charm, which is not to\r\nbe seen in the third drawing,[426] inscribed “Tho. Earle of Surry,”\r\nperhaps a little later in date, in which the head is turned slightly to\r\nthe left, and the hair entirely covered with the black skull-cap he\r\nwears beneath the feathered bonnet. The dress is only slightly\r\nindicated, and is rubbed, and a circular medallion suspended from a\r\nbroad ribbon hangs on his breast. A portrait of his wife is also to be\r\nfound among the Windsor heads,[427] full-face, wearing the angular\r\nEnglish head-dress with black fall, and a round jewelled ornament\r\nhanging from a chain round her neck, and a second medallion on her\r\nbreast. The dress which, like the ornaments, is badly rubbed, was of\r\nrose-coloured velvet, according to a note in Holbein’s handwriting. The\r\nportrait for which this drawing was the study, like that of her husband,\r\ncannot now be traced. The two full-length portraits of Henry Howard,\r\ndated 1546, at Arundel Castle and at Knole respectively, are usually\r\nascribed to the Netherlandish painter Guillim or Gillam Stretes, on\r\naccount of Strype’s statement, already quoted,[428] that in 1551 the\r\nPrivy Council ordered a picture “of the late Earl of Surrey, attainted,”\r\nto be fetched away from “the said Guillim’s house.” The Duke of\r\nNorfolk’s version of the portrait[429] has a very elaborate\r\narchitectural setting, coarsely painted in stone colour, and apparently\r\nof a somewhat later date than the rest of the picture, while the one\r\nbelonging to Lord Sackville at Knole shows the figure only, and is\r\nlooked upon by some authorities as the original. The attribution of\r\nthese two pictures to Stretes is extremely doubtful. The Arundel\r\nportrait, in particular, suggests the hand of an Italian, and the name\r\nof Nicolas Beilin of Modena may be tentatively suggested. One of them\r\nwas in the collection of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, where it was\r\nattributed to Holbein. It is described in the inventory of 1655 as “il\r\nritratto del Conte de Surry grande del naturale.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 423:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 312; Wornum, ii. 8; Holmes, ii. 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 424:\r\n\r\n  Parthey, 1509.

The Berlin panel,[430]\r\n(No. 586 C), is inscribed at the top, in gold, on either side of the\r\ncap, “ANNO 1541,” and lower down, in smaller letters, level with the\r\nsitter’s ears: “ETATIS : SVÆ : 37.” The coat of arms, enamelled in red\r\nand white, on the gold ring on his left hand, indicates that in all\r\nprobability this young man was a member of the Dutch family of Vos van\r\nSteenwijk, though the writer has failed to trace the name, or any\r\nindication of a sojourn in or visit to England on the part of its\r\nbearer, in the Calendars of the English State Papers. It is a\r\nhalf-length portrait, considerably less than life-size, head and body\r\nturned to the right, but both eyes shown. The eyes are grey, and the\r\nfinely painted beard and moustache are a reddish brown. In his clasped\r\nhands he holds a pair of brown gloves. He wears a black silk under-dress\r\nand a surcoat of black or very dark brown, with the collar turned over\r\nto show the lining of black watered silk, and his flat cap of the same\r\ncolour has a turned-down brim. He is gazing to the spectator’s right\r\nwith a far-away and slightly melancholy look in his eyes, which are\r\nwonderfully painted, as is the beautiful and expressive left hand. It\r\ncomes from the Von Sybel, Elberfeld, Merlo of Cologne, and Suermondt\r\ncollections, having been purchased from the last-named owner in 1874.\r\n\r\nFootnote 430:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 117.

It is one of his\r\ncustomary half-length figures, less than life-size, seated at a table,\r\nthe body turned to the right, and the face looking out at the spectator.\r\nHis doublet is of purple-brown silk, and over it he wears the usual\r\nblack cloak with a deep collar and lining of brown fur, and black cap\r\nwith a brim. The collar of his white shirt is beautifully embroidered\r\nwith black Spanish work and tied with black laces. His grey gloves are\r\nheld in his left hand, and his right rests on the olive-green cloth of\r\nthe table, the forefinger being thrust within the pages of a gilt-edged\r\nbook, near which is placed an inkstand with a red cord. On one of his\r\nrings is an intaglio. The clean-shaven face, showing blue on chin and\r\nupper lip, is of a ruddy brown complexion, and the hair, which does not\r\ncover the ears, is almost concealed by the hat. The unknown sitter, who\r\nappears to be an Englishman, is comely in features, and the eyes have a\r\nfar-seeing, visionary expression, which Holbein has rendered with\r\nextraordinary vividness and subtlety of drawing. The upper part of the\r\nbackground consists of a blue-grey wall, with wooden panelling, or the\r\nback of a long wooden seat, below, and the panel is inscribed on either\r\nside of the head: “ANNO · DNI · 1541 · ETATIS · SVÆ · 28.” It was in the\r\ncollection of the Archduke Leopold William in the seventeenth century.\r\nThere is an old copy of this picture in the Palermo Gallery (Woltmann,\r\n223).\r\n\r\nFootnote 431:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 254.

The head is full-face, the body turned slightly to the left. His\r\nclosely cropped hair is chestnut in colour, turning to red at the ends\r\nof his moustache and short pointed beard. It is almost the only portrait\r\nby Holbein in which the sitter is shown without a hat. He wears a dress\r\nof black velvet and watered silk with a pattern, slashed with red silk\r\nat the shoulder and wrist. On his left hand, which is gloved, stands his\r\nfalcon, a large bell on its claw. His right hand, in which he holds the\r\nbird’s hood, is ungloved, with a gold ring set with a stone on the\r\nlittle finger. The light falls from the right, and the shadow on the\r\nleft side of the face is more strongly marked than in most of Holbein’s\r\nportraits. The modelling is fine, the face full of strong character,\r\nand, as usual, the hands are most expressively painted, the whole\r\npresentment being most vivid and life-like. The background is a plain\r\nblue-grey, of much the same tone as that in the portrait of 1541 at\r\nVienna. Across the panel is inscribed, on either side of the head, the\r\ndate 1542, and lower down “ANNO · ETATIS · SVÆ · XXVIII.” Little is\r\nknown about the history of this picture, except that it was at one time\r\nin the royal collections of England, and that it was taken to Holland by\r\nWilliam III, and was included in the list of works of art reclaimed by\r\nQueen Anne after that King’s death.[433] Like the portrait of Cheseman,\r\nhowever, it remained abroad. It is inscribed on the back “The manner of\r\nHolbein,” and in old catalogues was absurdly described as a portrait of\r\nSir Thomas More.\r\n\r\nFootnote 432:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 160.

II., PLATE 28\r\n  PORTRAIT OF AN UNKNOWN MAN WITH A FALCON\r\n  1542\r\n  ROYAL PICTURE GALLERY, MAURITSHUIS, THE HAGUE\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: UNDATED PORTRAITS OF LAST YEARS]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that during this year Holbein painted Sir William\r\nFitzwilliam, created Earl of Southampton in 1538, who died at Newcastle\r\nin 1543. There is a fine drawing of the head in the Windsor\r\nCollection,[434] turned three-quarters to the right, wearing a black cap\r\nwith a medallion, and ear-flaps, or a coif, tied under the chin; slight\r\nwhiskers are indicated on the cheek-bones. It is a face of strong\r\nindividuality, with a big nose, finely and boldly drawn, the dress only\r\nroughly indicated. There is a full-length portrait of the Earl, 6 ft. ×\r\n3 ft. 3 in., in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (No. ii. 164),[435]\r\nwhich is described in the catalogue as probably a copy of the original\r\npicture by Holbein which, in 1793, was destroyed by fire at Cowdray\r\nHouse, the estate purchased by the Earl in 1528. He is represented\r\nstanding to the right, and wearing a black cap tied under the chin as in\r\nthe Windsor drawing, a long black cloak with fur collar reaching to the\r\nknees, dark hose and shoes, and the collar and jewel of the Garter round\r\nhis neck. He grasps a gold-headed staff in both hands, and stands on a\r\nterrace with a low parapet and a pavement of black and red tiles,\r\noverlooking a distant landscape consisting of wooded country and a\r\nland-locked harbour or estuary of a river with ships. His coat of arms\r\nis in the top left-hand corner, and in the right an inscription giving\r\nhis titles and offices, as Lord Privy Seal and Chancellor of the Duchy\r\nof Lancaster, and the date 1542. The supposition that this picture is a\r\ncopy after a lost original by Holbein is probably correct; it is quite\r\nin his manner, though in workmanship it in no way reaches to his\r\nmastery, the landscape background in particular showing an indecisive\r\ntouch quite unlike his firm handling. A copy of the head, evidently\r\ntaken from this picture, a small panel, 13⅛ in. × 9¾ in., was lent to\r\nthe Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition, 1909 (No. 34),[436] by the\r\nDuke of Devonshire, which is inscribed across the brown background, in\r\nan eighteenth-century hand, “SIR THOMAS MOORE.” The compilers of the\r\nBurlington Club catalogue do not accept the Cambridge portrait on which\r\nit is based as a copy after Holbein, but as an original work, and\r\nclearly by the same hand as the Earl of Surrey at Knole, the full-length\r\nof a young man in Hampton Court Palace, and the Sir Thomas Gresham in\r\nMercers’ Hall, with which the name of Guillim Stretes has been\r\nconnected, though on somewhat flimsy foundations.[437] The Windsor head,\r\nhowever, is in such close accord with the Fitzwilliam Museum picture\r\nthat it seems reasonable to suppose that the latter was based on it, or,\r\nrather, upon some painting of Holbein’s for which it formed the\r\npreliminary study. There were two portraits of the Earl in the Arundel\r\nCollection, both attributed to Holbein.[438]\r\n\r\nFootnote 434:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 291; Wornum, i. 5; Holmes, i. 17.

In one of his articles on the\r\n  Arundel Collection (see _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xxi., August 1912,\r\n  p. 257), Mr. Lionel Cust speaks of this head of the Earl, at Hardwick\r\n  Hall, as “perhaps by Holbein himself,” and states that, according to\r\n  Vertue, in the sale of the Earl of Oxford’s pictures, 1741, there was\r\n  sold “Lord Fitzwilliams,” a head by Holbein, for fifteen guineas.\r\n\r\nFootnote 438:\r\n\r\n  “Ritratto de ffitzwilliams Conte de Southampton,” and “Conte de\r\n  Southampton Fitzwilliams.”\r\n\r\nIn 1542 John Leland’s “Naeniae” on the death of Sir Thomas Wyat was\r\npublished, with the small circular woodcut of the poet after a drawing\r\nby Holbein, which has been already described;[439] but otherwise the\r\nonly dated portrait of this year is the one of the young man with the\r\nfalcon at the Hague, though there are several which must have been\r\npainted shortly before his death. Those of Dr. John Chamber and Sir\r\nWilliam Butts and his wife must have been produced in 1542 or the\r\nearlier half of 1543, while others, such as the “Elderly Man” at Berlin,\r\nthe small portrait of an English lady at Vienna, and the Simon George at\r\nFrankfurt, may be attributed with some certainty to the last seven or\r\neight years of Holbein’s life. It is probable, too, that he painted at\r\nabout this time another portrait of the Prince of Wales. No such\r\npainting now exists, but the full-faced head with a cap in the Windsor\r\nCollection[440] represents Edward as a boy of about five or six years of\r\nage, and certainly older than in the Hanover picture, while in the\r\nprofile head with cap and feather in the same collection of\r\ndrawings,[441] which forms the basis of numerous portraits in the\r\nNational Portrait Gallery and elsewhere, the boy seems even older,\r\nthough he was only six at the time of Holbein’s death.\r\n\r\nFootnote 439:\r\n\r\n  See p. 80.\r\n\r\nFootnote 440:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 327; Wornum, ii. 2; Holmes, not included.

See above, p. 167.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of an Unknown Man, aged fifty-four, in the Berlin Gallery\r\n(No. 586 I) (Pl. 29 (1)),[442] is another work of great power in its\r\nsuggestion of life-like portraiture, and of high technical excellence.\r\nHe is shown to the waist, slightly turned to the right. The face is a\r\ndignified one, with a long nose, and a slight droop in the right eyelid,\r\nand a look of melancholy absorption about his dark grey eyes. The hair\r\nand long beard are black, the latter with numerous grey hairs finely\r\nindicated with all Holbein’s customary minute care. The hands are thrust\r\nout of sight within the sleeves. His doublet, of which only the lower\r\npart of the sleeves is visible, is of ruby-red silk or satin, over which\r\nis a black or dark-brown coat with bands of black velvet, and lined with\r\na patterned watered silk. The black cap has gold tags. The plain\r\nbackground is a greyish-blue, and on either side of the head is\r\ninscribed in gold lettering, “ÆTATIS · SVÆ · 54.” On the back of the\r\npanel are the letters “W.E.P.L.C.,” apparently in a sixteenth-century\r\nhand, probably the mark of some early English collector. The same\r\nletters appear on the back of the portrait of Robert Cheseman at the\r\nHague, and on the portrait of a young man by Joos van Cleve in Berlin\r\n(No. 633 A), which was formerly in the Marlborough Collection, where it\r\nwas at one time attributed to Holbein. Nothing of the early history of\r\nthe portrait under discussion is known. It belonged at one time to Sir\r\nJ. E. Millais, and was lent by him to the Holbein Exhibition in Dresden\r\nin 1871, where it was acknowledged by the leading German critics to be a\r\nsplendid example of the master’s later English period. It was purchased\r\nat the Millais sale, in 1897, for 3000 guineas for the Kaiser Friedrich\r\nMuseum. There is a poor and lifeless copy of the head of this portrait\r\nin the collection of Mr. John G. Johnson, of Philadelphia.[443] The\r\npanel is a pastiche, for the copyist has attached the head of the\r\nMillais portrait to the body of the Unknown Young Man aged twenty-eight\r\nin the Vienna Gallery. In the copy of the head the hat is without the\r\ngold tags, the beard is slightly shorter, and the sitter appears to be\r\nsomewhat younger. In that of the body the dress, hands, the rings,\r\ngloves, and book follow the Vienna picture closely, but the copyist has\r\nremoved the two rings on the little finger of the right hand to the more\r\nusual ring-finger. Mr. C. Ricketts regards it as “almost certainly\r\nmodern. In draughtsmanship it is without subtlety, the nostril is\r\npreposterous, the under lip like a muffin.”[444] Mr. F. J. Mather\r\nconsiders it to be old, and of fair quality.\r\n\r\nFootnote 442:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 211.

The\r\nbackground is a deep grey-blue, surrounded by a frame imitating\r\nstonework. It has no inscription.\r\n\r\nFootnote 446:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 253.

He has dark, closely-cropped hair\r\nand pointed beard, with a black cap over the right ear, elaborately\r\nornamented with a white feather, many gold tags, an oval medallion with\r\na representation of Leda and the Swan, and a small bunch of enamelled\r\npansies. His dress is a rich one, and the open collar of the shirt is\r\ncovered with black embroidery of a floral pattern of conventional\r\ndesign. The background is of greenish blue, and some letters of a\r\ntwo-lined inscription, of later date than the painting, mutilated by the\r\nreduction of the panel, which appears to have been originally round, can\r\nstill be traced, including the letters NOB and part of the painter’s\r\nsignature, “IOHA : H.” It was acquired in 1870 from the\r\nBrentano-Birckenstock sale. The original study for the head is in the\r\nWindsor Collection,[448] and shows the same slight frown wrinkling the\r\nforehead as in the picture. The hairs of the moustache are very\r\ncarefully drawn, but the beard only shows a few days’ growth. It is\r\ninscribed at the bottom, in cursive writing, “S. George of Cornwall.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 447:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 151.

He is shown to the waist, turned three-quarters to the\r\nright, in a plain black doctor’s cap, which covers the hair and hides\r\nall but the lobe of the ears, and a black gown with brown fur collar;\r\nand he holds a pair of grey gloves in his hands. The background is a\r\nvery dark blue, and is inscribed, on either side of the head, “ÆTATIS\r\nSVE 88.” The date of John Chamber’s birth has not been traced, but the\r\nportrait was probably painted in 1541 or 1542, when Holbein was engaged\r\nupon the big “Barber-Surgeons” picture, in which Chamber is introduced\r\nin much the same position as in the Vienna portrait. He died at an\r\nadvanced age, well over ninety, in 1549. He was one of the King’s\r\nphysicians, and his name was the first on the roll of six doctors who in\r\n1518 received letters patent from the Crown giving them the privilege of\r\nadmitting other physicians to practise medicine in London, which was the\r\noriginal foundation of the Royal College of Physicians. Chamber was\r\njoint author with Dr. Butts and two others of a manuscript\r\n“Pharmacopœia” for the use of Henry VIII. As Court physician he attended\r\nAnne Boleyn at Greenwich Palace at the birth of the Princess Elizabeth,\r\nand it was he who reported to the Privy Council the critical condition\r\nof Jane Seymour when Edward VI was born. He married Joan Wardell in\r\n1545, when he was nearly ninety, and their son was christened in the\r\nfollowing year, both he and his wife dying within a few weeks of one\r\nanother in 1549. His career, however, was more remarkable for the many\r\nreligious preferments he gained, than for his medical skill. Born in\r\nNorthumberland, he became a priest in early life, and was a Fellow, and\r\nafterwards Warden, of Merton College, Oxford. In 1502 he went to Italy\r\nand graduated in physic in Padua. On his return to England he succeeded\r\nLinacre as the King’s chief physician. In 1522 he was Canon of Windsor,\r\nin 1536 Dean of the Collegiate Church of St. Stephen, and later on\r\nArchdeacon of Meath. A very excellent copy of this portrait is in the\r\npossession of Merton College, Oxford, and was included in the Oxford\r\nExhibition of Historical Portraits in 1904 (No. 27). It is inscribed on\r\nthe back: “Dr. Chamber, phisician of King Henry VIII, copied from Hanns\r\nHolbein’s original by H. Reinhart. The original, once belonging to the\r\ncollection of King Charles I, was, together with several other pictures\r\nof the same master, after the execution of this Monarch, sold and became\r\nthe property of Archduke Leopold, Stadtholder of the Low Countries, from\r\nwhence by legacy it passed into the Gallery of the Emperors of Austria\r\n(Ob. 1549).” The original portrait, however, does not appear at any time\r\nto have been included in the collection of Charles I, but it formed part\r\nof the wonderful series of works by Holbein got together by Thomas\r\nHoward, Earl of Arundel. In the _Dictionary of National Biography_ the\r\ndate of his birth is given as 1470, while the Oxford catalogue suggests\r\nthe date 1469, but neither can be correct, or otherwise the date of the\r\nVienna picture would be 1557 or 1558, fourteen years or so after\r\nHolbein’s death. If the age of the sitter, eighty-eight, as given on the\r\npanel, is correct, and it is accepted that the portrait was painted\r\nabout 1542, Chamber must have been born about 1454. The Merton College\r\ncopy was exhibited at the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, 1901-2 (No.\r\n155), as a work of the school of Holbein. In 1894 the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians became possessed of a miniature portrait of Chamber, painted\r\non the back of the ten of clubs, and said to be by Isaac Oliver. This is\r\na careful copy of the Vienna picture, and has a long Latin inscription,\r\ngiving Chamber’s titles, and the date of his death, round the frame. The\r\noriginal, when in the Arundel Collection, was engraved by Hollar\r\n(Parthey, 1372), with the inscription “D. Chambers Anno Ætatis Svæ 88.\r\nHolbein pinxit.” In the Arundel inventory it is described as “Doctore\r\nJohn Chambers.” It is possibly one of the pictures which remained on the\r\nContinent after the death of the Countess of Arundel in 1654.\r\n\r\nFootnote 449:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 255.

JOHN CHAMBER\r\n  IMPERIAL GALLERY, VIENNA\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF DR. JOHN CHAMBER]\r\n\r\nThe portraits of Sir William and Lady Butts,[450] which have suffered,\r\nmore particularly the former, from coarse repainting, are probably of\r\nabout the same date as the Dr. Chamber, for Butts is also one of the\r\nprominent figures in the “Barber-Surgeons” group. The portrait of the\r\nhusband has an inscription which has been repainted by an ignorant\r\ncopyist, and now reads “ANNO ATATS SVE LIX.” Unfortunately, as in the\r\ncase of Chamber, the year of Butts’ birth is not known, so that the\r\nexact date of the portrait cannot be proved. It is given in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery Catalogue as 1485 (?). His tombstone at Fulham bears\r\nonly the date of his death, 1545. The portraits show the heads and\r\nshoulders only. Sir William is represented in profile to the right, in\r\nblack cap and furred gown, and a heavy gold chain upon his shoulders.\r\nHis face is clean-shaven, and his grey hair almost covers the ears. Lady\r\nButts is painted almost full-face, but turned slightly to the left. She\r\nwears the angular English head-dress with black fall, a plain dress with\r\nfur-trimmed mantle, and a large enamelled rose at her breast. Above her\r\nhead is inscribed “ANNO ÆTATIS SVE LVII.” Both portraits were in the\r\nNational Portrait Exhibition, 1866, lent by Mr. W. H. Pole-Carew, and\r\nare now in the collection of Mrs. John Gardner, Fenway Court, Boston,\r\nU.S.A. They are about 18 in. × 14 in., and the green backgrounds and\r\ninscriptions of both pictures have been badly repainted. There is a good\r\ncopy or replica of Sir William in the National Portrait Gallery[451]\r\n(No. 210), and copies of both husband and wife, apparently\r\nseventeenth-century work, in the collection of Mr. F. A.\r\nNewdegate-Newdigate, at Arbury, Warwickshire. There is no head of Butts\r\namong the Windsor drawings, but that collection contains a masterly one\r\nof his wife,[452] in which the lines of the face are very strongly\r\nmarked. She was a daughter of John Bacon of Cambridgeshire. The portrait\r\nof their third son, Edmund Butts, of Thornham, Norfolk, who died at the\r\nage of thirty in 1549, is in the National Gallery (No. 1496), and is\r\nregarded as a work of that little-known English painter John Bettes.\r\nThis portrait is dated 1545, and the age of the sitter is given as\r\ntwenty-six, and on a card on the back is the inscription “_faict par\r\nJohan Bettes Anglois_.”[453]\r\n\r\nFootnote 450:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 204, 205.

The\r\narmorial bearings on this picture indicate a member of the Butts family,\r\nbut the person represented is certainly not the same as in the National\r\nGallery portrait, nor do the two appear to be the work of the same\r\npainter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PORTRAIT OF SIR WILLIAM BUTTS]\r\n\r\nDr. Butts was in receipt of a salary of £100 a year from the King, and\r\nwas the favourite physician about the Court. He was a native of Norfolk,\r\nand educated at Cambridge. Many prescriptions in his handwriting are\r\npreserved in the British Museum. He appears as one of the characters in\r\nShakespeare’s _Henry VIII_ (Act v. sc. 2), and his name occurs in a\r\nnumber of contemporary letters. Thus, in 1537, the Earl of Shrewsbury\r\nwrote thanking Cromwell “for asking the King to licence Dr. Buttes to\r\ncome to him”;[454] and on October 6, 1542, the Earl of Southampton wrote\r\nto Wriothesley from York, when upon the expedition against Scotland:\r\n“Recommend me to Butts, and thank him for his pills. I would not have\r\nforegone them at this time for all the good I have.”[455] In spite of\r\nthe pills, however, the Earl died at Newcastle nine days later.\r\n\r\nFootnote 454:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xii. pt. i. 328.\r\n\r\nFootnote 455:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xvii. 912.\r\n\r\nA small half-length portrait of an Unknown Man in the Basel Collection\r\n(No. 327),[456] belongs to the later period of Holbein’s English\r\nresidence. He is turned three-quarters to the left, and wears the\r\ncustomary dark fur-lined surcoat and black cap, and dark purple sleeves,\r\nand holds his gloves and a paper, upon which the inscription is now\r\nillegible, in his clasped hands. The beard, moustache, and hair are\r\ndark. This picture, which was purchased in Basel in 1862, has been more\r\nthan once restored, so that Holbein’s handiwork has suffered\r\nconsiderably. Another small picture which is also now in a damaged state\r\nis the portrait of a young English lady in the collection of Count\r\nLanckoronski in Vienna,[457] which was regarded by Woltmann as probably\r\nby Holbein, but when exhibited in the Dresden Exhibition of 1871 was\r\ndeclared by the critics to be a genuine work. It is similar in style to\r\nthe small portrait of a Lady in the Vienna Gallery, and of about the\r\nsame date. She is shown at half-length, turned a little to the\r\nspectator’s right, with clasped hands, and wearing a dark dress with red\r\npuffings and gold tags from shoulder to wrist, and a French hood with\r\nbands of gold ornaments and a black fall. Round her neck is a gold chain\r\nwith a pendant with seven flat stones, a second gold chain, and a large\r\nbrooch fastened at her breast with a cameo of a double head, a young\r\nman’s shown full-face, attached to one of a lady in profile. Across the\r\nplain green background, on either side of her head, is inscribed “ANNO\r\nETATIS SVÆ XVII.” In appearance she is stolid and unattractive, but this\r\nmay be partly due to the present state of the picture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 456:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 22.

Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 144.\r\n\r\nThere remains one other portrait of a lady of about this date—that of\r\nLady Rich,[458] which until 1912 had been for many years in the\r\npossession of the Moseley family at Buildwas Park, Shropshire. The\r\nsitter is represented to the waist, slightly turned to the right, and\r\nwears the English diamond-shaped hood with black fall, and a black dress\r\nwith a gold medallion decorated with the figures of a man and woman by a\r\ncorpse, which, according to Wornum, are “exquisitely put in.”[459]\r\nAccording to the same writer, it is “a fine expressive portrait, with a\r\nthin rich carnation.” It is painted on wood, 17 in. by 13 in., and has\r\nsuffered some retouching. The face is a most determined one, as can be\r\nseen from the fine preliminary drawing in the Windsor Castle\r\nCollection.[460] Lady Rich was the daughter and heiress of William Jenks\r\nor Gynkes, a rich London grocer, and she married, in 1535, Lord\r\nChancellor Rich, of notorious memory, who helped to ruin many of the\r\nprominent men of his day, such as More and Fisher. In the seventeenth\r\ncentury the portrait became the property of the Rev. Herbert Croft,\r\nBishop of Hereford, whose granddaughter, Elizabeth Croft, married Acton\r\nMoseley, of Staffordshire. In 1792 the portrait, with some other\r\npictures, was bequeathed by Sir Archer Croft to his cousin, Mr. Walter\r\nMichael Moseley. The latter’s descendant, Captain H. R. Moseley, parted\r\nwith the picture in 1912, and it is now in an American collection.[461]\r\nIt was last exhibited at the National Portrait Exhibition at South\r\nKensington in 1866 as a portrait of “Queen Katherine of Arragon.” There\r\nis also a drawing of her husband, Richard Rich,[462] at Windsor, and\r\nHolbein must almost certainly have painted his portrait, but all traces\r\nof it have been lost. A version of it was among the pictures destroyed\r\nby fire at Knepp Castle in 1904.\r\n\r\nFootnote 458:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 128.\r\n\r\nFootnote 459:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 296.\r\n\r\nFootnote 460:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 319; Wornum, ii. 37; Holmes, ii. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 461:\r\n\r\n  For a fuller history of the picture, see an article in _The Morning\r\n  Post_, May 23rd, 1912.\r\n\r\nFootnote 462:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 318; Wornum, i. 8; Holmes, ii. 9.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN’S SELF-PORTRAITS]\r\n\r\nAmong the very last works from Holbein’s hand must have been the various\r\nminiature portraits of himself, dated 1543, described in the next\r\nchapter.[463] The self-portrait in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence,[464]\r\nwhich is evidently founded on one of them, or on one of the small\r\noil-paintings, now lost, has few pretensions, in the writer’s opinion,\r\nto be regarded as an original work, though it is, of course, possible\r\nthat beneath the brush-work of some later and inferior painter there may\r\nbe an original work by Holbein now practically obliterated. It is only\r\nright, however, to point out that Dr. Ganz considers it to be an\r\noriginal though damaged drawing, and other writers are in agreement with\r\nhim. It is in coloured crayons on a gold ground, and the comparatively\r\nmodern inscription with the date 1543 has been painted over an earlier\r\none, which can be still traced below. Dr. Ganz suggests that it is\r\nprobably one of the two portraits which Van Mander saw in Amsterdam in\r\n1604.\r\n\r\nFootnote 463:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 230-231. Also Vol. i. pp. 27-8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 464:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 150. Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 134, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOf far greater interest is the recently-discovered portrait, first\r\npublished in 1912 by Dr. Ganz,[465] which he considers to be a genuine\r\nself-portrait by Holbein, hitherto unknown. The likeness both to the\r\nnumerous miniatures and to the Uffizi portrait is so great that the\r\nattribution is most certainly the correct one. It is in all ways much\r\nmore attractive than the last-named work, and has far greater vitality\r\nand a more subtle expression of character. It is a drawing of the head\r\nand shoulders only, turned slightly to the spectator’s right, and the\r\npainter is wearing a dark fur-lined cloak and black cap. Part of the\r\nleft hand only is shown. It is a coloured-crayon drawing touched with\r\nwater-colour, on white paper which has been covered with a\r\nflesh-coloured ground. The paper has a Zürich water-mark, and was only\r\nmanufactured between 1536-1540, so that the date of the drawing can be\r\nfixed with some accuracy, and was very probably done in Basel during\r\nHolbein’s short visit home in the autumn of 1538. It has, unfortunately,\r\nsuffered considerable damage, and here and there has been touched up\r\nwith Indian-ink. On the top right-hand comer of the blue background is\r\ninscribed, in a later hand, “H. H. 15 ...” It was purchased in England\r\nin the summer of 1910, and is now in Basel in the collection of Dr.\r\nRudolph Geigy-Schlumberger.[466]\r\n\r\nFootnote 465:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 138.\r\n\r\nFootnote 466:\r\n\r\n  See Ganz, _Holbein_, pp. xxxix. and 244. He suggests that this drawing\r\n  is perhaps the “ritratto d’homo aquazzo” of the Arundel inventory.\r\n\r\nSeveral portraits by Holbein, which so far have not been traced, were\r\netched by Hollar when they were in the Arundel Collection, and these\r\nprints, in the absence of the originals, form invaluable records for the\r\nuse of students. Some few of them, however, though Hollar has placed\r\nHolbein’s name on them, cannot have been painted by him, as, for\r\ninstance, the portrait of Thomas Chaloner,[467] which is dated 1548. All\r\nthe more important of them are reproduced by Dr. Ganz in his _Holbein_\r\n(1912),[468] and several have been already described in these pages.\r\nAmong those remaining there is one of an unknown bearded man in a black\r\ncap,[469] and two of unnamed boys.[470] The second of these boys, whose\r\nhead is turned three-quarters to the left, appears, from the details of\r\nthe dress he is wearing, to be a Swiss. Holbein’s original silver-point\r\nstudy for the portrait from which the etching was taken is in the\r\nLouvre, and is dated 1520. The connection between the two was first\r\npointed out by Dr. Ganz.[471] The circular portrait of Sir Anthony Denny\r\nis inscribed “ANNO 1541 ÆTATIS SVÆ 29.”[472] The original painting, a\r\nsmall roundel, descended, according to Mr. W. Barclay Squire, to the\r\nHowards of Greystoke Castle, and is now in the collection of Mr. J.\r\nPierpont Morgan, junr. There is an old copy of it at Longford\r\nCastle.[473] The large print of an elderly, grey-bearded man, with fur\r\ncoat, and cap with a feather,[474] is usually said to represent Charles\r\nBrandon, Duke of Suffolk, but though it bears considerable likeness to\r\nthe authentic portraits of him, the attribution is doubtful. There are\r\nseveral portraits of English ladies among Hollar’s work. Of one, in\r\nwhich the sitter is turned to the right, and is wearing a round\r\nhead-dress surmounted by a flat black cap with a large feather,[475]\r\nthere is no study known, but for two others, which Hollar has reproduced\r\nas small roundels, the preliminary drawings are to be found in the\r\nWindsor Collection, one of them of an unknown lady, full-face, wearing\r\nthe angular head-dress,[476] and the other the drawing inscribed “The\r\nLady Mary after Queen.”[477] The profile portrait of a lady, which has\r\nbeen considered by some writers to represent Anne of Cleves,[478] does\r\nnot appear to be after an original by Holbein, though Hollar has placed\r\nhis name on it. It is possible, though not very probable, that some of\r\nthese circular etchings were based on the drawings, and not on finished\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nFootnote 467:\r\n\r\n  Parthey, 1371.\r\n\r\nFootnote 468:\r\n\r\n  pp. 196-200.\r\n\r\nFootnote 469:\r\n\r\n  Parthey, 1544.\r\n\r\nFootnote 470:\r\n\r\n  Parthey, 1551 and 1543.\r\n\r\nFootnote 471:\r\n\r\n  See _Holbein_, p. 250.

It runs as follows: “Hans Holbin.—Jupiter\r\nand Jo in Water Coulers.” This picture, of which all traces are lost,\r\nwas hanging in the Vaulted Room. The Duke possessed a number of other\r\nworks by or attributed to Holbein, but unfortunately the entries in the\r\ninventory are so tantalisingly vague that it is impossible to gather\r\nmuch information about them, though two of them seem to have been\r\nportraits of Steelyard merchants. They included “Erasmus Rotterodamm\r\nafter Holbin”; “A Dutchman Sealing a Letter” (possibly the John of\r\nAntwerp now at Windsor);[480] “A Rare piece, being a Dutchman”; “A\r\nQueen”; “An other Lady”; “A little picture in Linnen”; and “A little\r\npicture of Holbin himself,” which was probably one of the miniatures.\r\nWith the exception of the last-named, all are described as by “Holbin”\r\nor “Hans Holbin.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 479:\r\n\r\n  See Randall Davies, _Burlington Magazine_, vol. x., March 1907, pp.\r\n  376-82.

He says, under the date May 8, 1654: “I also call’d at Mr.\r\nDucie’s, who has indeede a rare collection of the best masters, and one\r\nof the largest stories of H. Holbein.” This, however, may have been some\r\npicture similar to “The Battle of Spurs” at Hampton Court, attributed to\r\nHolbein in Evelyn’s day, and not a genuine work of the master. His\r\njudgment was not always infallible, as he speaks of the well-known\r\n“Dancing Picture,”[481] which he saw at the Duke of Norfolk’s at\r\nWeybridge (23rd August 1678) as “that incomparable painting of\r\nHolbein’s.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 481:\r\n\r\n  This picture was traditionally said to have been begun in France by\r\n  Janet (Clouet), and Vertue thought it might have been retouched by\r\n  Holbein, “as it was probably painted for his patron, the Duke of\r\n  Norfolk, from whom it descended immediately to the Earl of Arundel,\r\n  out of whose collection the father of the present possessor (Colonel\r\n  Sotheby) purchased it.” (See Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, i. p.\r\n  95.) It was lent to the Tudor Exhibition, 1890, by Major-Gen. F. E.\r\n  Sotheby, No. 145. The only entry in the Arundel inventory which it is\r\n  just possible might refer to this picture is “Un quadretto con diverse\r\n  figure Jocatori, etc.,” which is given to Holbein.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n                     HOLBEIN AS A MINIATURE PAINTER\r\n\r\nEarly references to Holbein as a miniature painter—Receives instruction\r\n  from Lucas Hornebolt—Rareness of genuine miniatures by him—Sir Thomas\r\n  More—Lord Abergavenny—Lady Audley—Henry and Charles Brandon—Drawing in\r\n  the British Museum of a lady and children on a bench—Miniature of Mrs.\r\n  Robert Pemberton—Unknown youth in the Queen of Holland’s\r\n  Collection—Miniature paintings of Holbein himself—Thomas Cromwell—Anne\r\n  of Cleves—Jane Seymour—Edward VI—Livina Teerlinc—Miniatures of the\r\n  Holbein school—Miniature of an unknown man, possibly the painter Harry\r\n  Maynert, at Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old tradition that Holbein did not practise miniature painting until\r\nafter he had settled in England is probably true. Van Mander says that\r\nit was only at a late period, after he had entered the King’s service,\r\nthat he, who knew how to adapt himself almost to everything, took up the\r\nart of miniature painting, in which he had before done nothing. At that\r\ntime he met at the Court a very famous master in this art, named Master\r\nLukas. “With Lukas he kept up mutual acquaintance and intercourse, and\r\nlearned from him the art of miniature painting, which, since then, he\r\npursued to such an extent, that in a short time he as far excelled Lukas\r\nin drawing, arrangement, understanding, and execution, as the sun\r\nsurpasses the moon in brightness.”[482] Seventy years later Sandrart\r\nrepeated this statement, which he evidently took from Van Mander’s book.\r\nThe Master Lukas in question was undoubtedly Lucas Hornebolt, who was in\r\nthe employment of the King throughout the whole period of Holbein’s\r\nresidence in England. So far, the only pictures extant which have been\r\nattributed with some certainty to the studio of Lucas and Gerard\r\nHornebolt are the portraits of Henry VIII, of the type of the Warwick\r\nCastle portrait, when that monarch was drawing towards the end of his\r\nlife; but the sister, Susanna, wife of John Parker, Yeoman of the Robes,\r\nand one of the King’s bowmen, was well known in her day as an excellent\r\nminiaturist, while Guicciardini speaks of Lucas as not only a very great\r\npainter, but as exceptionally good in the art of illuminating, so that\r\nit is extremely probable that a number of the miniatures still in\r\nexistence, representing Henry, his wives, and members of his Court,\r\nwhich though very excellent, have not the brilliance of execution and\r\nthe unfailing insight into character which mark the few genuine\r\nminiatures by Holbein, were the work of the members of this family.\r\nGuicciardini published his book only twenty-four years after Holbein’s\r\ndeath, so that his account of the position they occupied at Henry’s\r\ncourt, and the estimation in which they were held in England, borne out\r\nas it is by the royal accounts, is evidently an accurate one.\r\n\r\nFootnote 482:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Woltmann from Van Mander, i. p. 407; English translation, p.\r\n  370.\r\n\r\nFurther confirmation of the fact that Holbein was famous for his skill\r\nin miniature painting during his residence in England is to be found in\r\na manuscript “Treatise concerning the Arte of Limning,” which was\r\nwritten, at the request of Richard Haydock, by Nicholas Hilliard, the\r\nfirst and one of the finest of English native-born miniature painters,\r\nwho was born in all probability in 1537, and so was a boy of six when\r\nHolbein died, and based his art on Holbein’s own practice. This\r\ntreatise, which was first published in its entirety by Dr. Philip Norman\r\nin the first annual volume of the Walpole Society, 1911-12, from the\r\noriginal manuscript in the Edinburgh University Library, was probably\r\nwritten by Hilliard between 1598-1602. The manuscript, which is not in\r\nthe miniaturist’s own hand, is dated 18th March 1624. In it Hilliard\r\nextols “King Henry the eight a Prince of exquisit jugment and Royall\r\nbounty, soe that of cuning stranger even the best resorted unto him, and\r\nremoved from other courts to his. Amongst whom came the most excelent\r\nPainter and limner Master Haunce Holbean the greatest Master Truly in\r\nboth thosse arts after the liffe that ever was, so Cuning in both\r\ntogether and the neatest; and therewithall a good inventor, soe compleat\r\nfor all three, as I never heard of any better then hee. Yet had the King\r\nin wages for limning Divers others, but Holbean’s maner of limning I\r\nhave ever imitated and howld it for the best, by Reason that of truth\r\nall the rare Siences especially the arts of Carving, Painting,\r\nGoudsmiths, Imbroderers, together with the most of all the liberall\r\nSiences came first unto us from the strangers, and generally they are\r\nthe best and most in number. I heard Kinsard [Ronsard?] the great French\r\npoet on a time say, that the Ilands indeed seldome bring forth any\r\nCunning man, but when they Doe it is in high perfection; so then I hope\r\nthere maie come out of this ower land such a one, this being the\r\ngreatest and most famous Iland of Europe.”[483]\r\n\r\nFootnote 483:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Holmes, _Burlington Magazine_, vol. viii., January 1906, p.\r\n  229. See also _Walpole Society_, vol. i., 1912, pp. 18-19.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “MINIATURA, OR ART OF LIMNING”]\r\n\r\nStill further proof of Holbein’s fame as a limner or miniature painter\r\nis to be found in a manuscript written by Edward Norgate, called\r\n“Miniatura or the Art of Limning,” now among the Rawlinson MSS. in the\r\nBodleian Library, dedicated to Henry Frederick, Earl of Arundel. Other\r\nversions of this treatise on the “Art of Limning” are in the British\r\nMuseum (Harl. MSS., No. 6000); in the possession of the Royal Society,\r\nwhich came from the Arundel Collection; and elsewhere. Norgate based a\r\nconsiderable part of his treatise on the earlier one by Hilliard. “The\r\nincomparable H. Holbein,” he says, “who, in all his different and\r\nvarious methods of painting, either in oyle, distempre, lymning or\r\ncrayon, was, it seems, so general an artist as never to imitate any man,\r\nnor ever was worthily imitated by any.”[484]\r\n\r\nFootnote 484:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Dallaway in his notes to Walpole, _Anecdotes_, &c., ed.\r\n  Wornum, vol. i. pp. 111-2. For a full account of Hilliard’s treatise,\r\n  and the various versions of Norgate’s work, see Dr. Philip Norman in\r\n  the Walpole Society’s publication, mentioned above; also Mr. Martin\r\n  Hardie in vol. ii. of Dr. G. C. Williamson’s _History of Portrait\r\n  Miniatures_, 1904.\r\n\r\nVan Mander is, no doubt, correct in saying that Holbein received\r\ninstruction in the art of miniature painting from Lucas Hornebolt, and\r\nthat he had not practised it until he came to England; though Hornebolt\r\nhad nothing to teach him but the practical use of a medium in which, as\r\napplied to portraiture, he had until then had very little experience.\r\nThere is no evidence to show that he produced true miniatures while in\r\nBasel, though there is one attributed to him in the collection of the\r\nlate Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, a portrait of a Baseler, a certain Arnold\r\nFranz, described below, which affords possible proof that he did so.\r\nSuch an isolated example as this, however, may have been painted during\r\none of his later visits to Basel, or it may represent one of the members\r\nof the German colony in London. Several of his small circular oil\r\npaintings, almost the size of the true miniature, have been described in\r\nearlier chapters,[485] so that he was already skilled in working on a\r\nsmall scale, and within it of producing a life-like portrait, of the\r\nutmost delicacy and truth to nature, while his extraordinary skill and\r\nprecision in rendering with most minute yet masterly touches of the\r\nbrush all the details of the sitter’s costume, jewellery, and\r\naccessories, must have left him little to learn when he began to work in\r\nthe new medium. It is evident that he soon set up a standard of\r\nexcellence in this field which both his contemporaries and the\r\nminiaturists who came after him did their best to reach.\r\n\r\nFootnote 485:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. pp. 180, 184-5; Vol. ii. pp. 14, 20, 70-1.\r\n\r\nHis miniatures are now of the greatest rarity, though there are many in\r\nvarious English collections which still wrongfully bear his name, given\r\nto them in less critical days, when every portrait, great and small,\r\ndating from Tudor times, was ascribed to him. In certain of these, very\r\npossibly Holbein’s original handiwork has been buried beneath repairs\r\nand repaints by later and less skilful hands. No doubt a number of\r\nothers have been lost, for so delicate and small an object of art as a\r\nminiature is soon damaged or mislaid; though against this must be set\r\nthe fact that many of them were kept in specially-made ivory boxes, and\r\nso would not easily suffer destruction. The number of them which, from\r\nthe perfection of their execution, can be said with some approach to\r\ncertainty to be from his brush, can be counted almost on the fingers of\r\none’s hands. These include the portraits of Mrs. Pemberton; the two sons\r\nof the Duke of Suffolk, Henry and Charles Brandon; Lady Audley; Queen\r\nCatherine Howard; Sir Thomas More; the portrait of an unknown youth in\r\nthe Queen of Holland’s collection; several of the painter himself, done\r\nin the last year of his life, and two or three others. After these come\r\nseveral which, though less perfect in draughtsmanship, have serious\r\nclaims to be considered as his work, and after these, again, there are\r\nthose fairly numerous examples which, though of good execution and of\r\nreal interest and value, have no pretensions to rank as works of the\r\ngreat master. Some of these have been attributed tentatively to such\r\npainters as the Hornebolts, Livina Teerlinc, Stretes, or Bettes, though\r\nmodern criticism has not succeeded as yet in disentangling the works of\r\nthese little masters the one from the other, so that the various\r\nattributions are at present more or less mere guesswork.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINIATURES OF SIR THOMAS MORE]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful miniature of Sir Thomas More, rediscovered by Dr.\r\nWilliamson when in the Godolphin-Quicke Collection, and first published\r\nby him in his _History of Portrait Miniatures_, which is in the late Mr.\r\nJ. Pierpont Morgan’s collection, has been already described when\r\nspeaking of the portraits of Sir Thomas.[486] A second miniature of\r\nMore, in the collection of the Duke of Buccleuch at Montagu House, was\r\nfirst reproduced by Mr. Dudley Heath in _The Connoisseur_.”[487] This,\r\nthough based, like the Pierpont Morgan miniature, on the Huth portrait,\r\nshows some differences from both. It is smaller than the other\r\nminiature, and the sitter appears to be some years older. The eyes are\r\nmore downcast and the head slightly bent, while the scanty beard is\r\nwhiter. In other respects the dress, consisting of black cap and furred\r\ngown, and collar of SS with the Tudor rose, is the same. Another\r\ninteresting point about it is that it is painted, not in water-colours,\r\nbut in oil on a gesso ground, upon a metal plaque which appears to be\r\nsilver. It has, unfortunately, suffered to some extent in the course of\r\ntime, and has been retouched here and there, but it is a fine example,\r\nvery possibly by Holbein, showing, according to Mr. Heath, “that vivid\r\nrealism, yet reserve of expression, that sensitive modulation of the\r\ntones and contours, that insistent yet flexible drawing of the features,\r\nwhich constitute the sign-manual of the great portrait painter.” Nothing\r\nseems to be known of the history of this miniature, which was exhibited\r\nat South Kensington in 1862 (No. 2061), in the Royal Academy Winter\r\nExhibition in 1879 (Case L, 4), and at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in\r\n1909 (Case C, 17). These miniatures of More would seem to suggest that\r\nHolbein’s earlier biographers were wrong in stating that he did not\r\nbegin to practise in this branch of art until after he had entered Henry\r\nVIII’s service. It has been generally supposed that when he returned to\r\nEngland a second time he saw little or nothing of the Chancellor, and if\r\nthat is so, these miniatures must have been painted between 1526 and\r\n1528, when he was at work on the big group of his first English patron’s\r\nfamily. At that time, however, Holbein had no official connection with\r\nthe court, and was possibly not yet on terms of intimacy with the\r\nHornebolts, so that it seems more probable that any miniatures of More\r\nfrom his hand were done between 1532, the date of Holbein’s return to\r\nLondon, and 1534, when the ex-Chancellor was imprisoned in the Tower.\r\nAnother possible solution is that they were painted after More’s death\r\nfor friends or relations who desired a memorial of him, and were done\r\nfrom the oil painting or from the preliminary drawings still in the\r\npainter’s possession.\r\n\r\nFootnote 486:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. pp. 306-7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 487:\r\n\r\n  _The Connoisseur_, vol. xviii.

Also reproduced in _Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition\r\n  Catalogue_, Pl. xxxiii.\r\n\r\nAnother miniature from the Montagu House Collection was also reproduced\r\nfor the first time by Mr. Dudley Heath in the same article,[488] and was\r\nlent by the Duke of Buccleuch to the Burlington Fine Arts Club\r\nExhibition (Case C, 22). It represents George Nevill, third Lord\r\nAbergavenny, and, as already noted,[489] is founded on the fine drawing\r\nin the collection of the Earl of Pembroke, for so long considered to be\r\na portrait of Thomas Cromwell. The face, which is that of an old man, is\r\nturned three-quarters to the spectator’s right, and is clean-shaven. His\r\nwhite hair is almost covered by the black cap, on which is a gold jewel\r\nwith three pendant pearls. He wears a black fur-lined gown over a black\r\ndoublet open at the throat, showing his white shirt. On the left-hand\r\nside of the bright-blue background is inscribed “G. Abergaveny.” It is\r\npainted, like nearly all miniatures of the period, on a playing card,\r\nand is 1¾ in. in diameter. It was purchased by its present owner, with\r\nsome other miniatures, at the Earl of Westmorland’s sale at Apethorpe\r\nHall, Northamptonshire, in 1892. It is in a perfect state of\r\npreservation, full of vitality, and excellent in modelling, and has\r\nconsiderable claims to be regarded as an original. The pale, high tones\r\nof the flesh colour are in marked contrast to the lower tones of the oil\r\nminiature of Sir Thomas More in the same collection.\r\n\r\nFootnote 488:\r\n\r\n  _The Connoisseur_, vol. xviii., July 1907, frontispiece (in colour).\r\n  Also reproduced in _Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition Catalogue_,\r\n  Pl. xxxiii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 489:\r\n\r\n  See p. 62.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL.

PIERPONT MORGAN’S COLLECTION\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINIATURE OF LADY AUDLEY]\r\n\r\nThe two almost similar miniatures of Catherine Howard, at Windsor Castle\r\n(Pl. 31 (4)) and Montagu House, have been already described;[490] both\r\nare beautiful examples, and each one is almost certainly from Holbein’s\r\nown hand, though the former has suffered from restoration. In the royal\r\ncollection at Windsor there are three other miniatures which also can be\r\ngiven to him without any hesitation, all three being masterpieces of the\r\nart of the limner; these are the portraits of Lady Audley and the two\r\nBrandon boys. The miniature of Lady Audley (Pl. 31 (3)),[491] is of\r\nextraordinary delicacy in handling and colour, and bears the stamp of\r\nHolbein in every minute and unerring touch. As Mr. Law says, “there was\r\nno other artist at the court of Henry VIII, or indeed in Northern\r\nEurope, who could have produced so exquisite a work of art.”[492] She is\r\nshown to the waist, turned to the right, with hands folded in front of\r\nher. Her richly-brocaded dress is of pale crimson, with under-sleeves of\r\ndark grey and white ruffles, and she wears a French hood trimmed with\r\npearls, and a black fall over her fair hair. Her double necklace is of\r\nalmost the same pattern as the one worn by Catherine Howard. There is no\r\ninscription on the plain, deep blue background. It is 2½ in. in\r\ndiameter, and is painted on the back of the two of hearts. The identity\r\nof the sitter is placed beyond doubt by the fine drawing, inscribed “The\r\nLady Audley,” in the Windsor Collection (Pl. 37 (1)),[493] in which the\r\nposition and features of the sitter, the costume and ornaments, are\r\nalmost exactly the same, while the colour of the dress in the miniature\r\nagrees with the note in Holbein’s handwriting on the drawing—“damast\r\nrot.” This drawing is one of the finest and most delicate among the\r\nheads of women in the Windsor Collection—a long, handsome face, with\r\npointed chin and sharp nose, and very expressive eyes. Holbein has\r\ncarefully indicated the details of the ornaments she is wearing. Her\r\nnecklace is of elaborate workmanship, apparently a band of alternate\r\nlinks of enamel and pearls arranged as flowers, with a large pendant\r\nwith inset facetted jewels and three hanging pearls. At her breast is a\r\nlarge circular ornament of a somewhat similar design. The oil painting\r\nfor which the preliminary study was made, and from which the miniature\r\nwas possibly taken, is now lost. Elizabeth, Lady Audley, was the eldest\r\ndaughter of one who must have been in constant touch with Holbein—Sir\r\nBryan Tuke, the Treasurer of the Chamber, whose portrait by him has been\r\nalready described, and from whose hands he received his salary. She\r\nmarried John Touchet, ninth Lord Audley.\r\n\r\nFootnote 490:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 192-193.\r\n\r\nFootnote 491:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 270.

Reproduced by Davies,\r\n  p. 220; and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe portraits of the two young sons of the Duke of Suffolk, Henry and\r\nCharles Brandon, are acknowledged on all sides to be among the very\r\nfinest of Holbein’s miniatures. Dr. Woltmann, indeed, considered the one\r\nof the elder brother to be the best which ever came from his brush. It\r\nis, he says, “the most beautiful miniature painting by Holbein that is\r\nknown to us, and exhibits more strikingly than any other his artistic\r\nstyle and his spirited and perfect mode of execution, true in spite of\r\nall its delicacy.”[494] This is certainly by no means too high praise,\r\nfor both miniatures are delightful renderings of childhood, drawn with\r\nall Holbein’s keen perception, and faultless in their precision of line\r\nand delightfulness of colouring. The elder boy, Henry (Pl. 31 (1)),[495]\r\naged five, is shown to the waist, full-face, leaning with his left arm\r\non a table at his side, his head slightly bent in the same direction. He\r\nis wearing a black velvet dress with green under-sleeves, and a black\r\nhat with a white feather. His fair hair is cut straight across his\r\nforehead, and there is a rather sad look in his eyes. On the ledge of\r\nthe table is inscribed, “ETATIS SVE 5 6 SEPDEM,” and below, on the\r\ntable-leg, “ANNO” and the date, which has been variously read by\r\ndifferent writers. The younger brother, Charles (Pl. 31 (2)),[496] aged\r\nthree, is also seen to the waist and full-face. His dress is a bluish\r\ngrey braided in red, and with black cuffs. His flat black cap has no\r\nfeather; his hair, like his brother’s, is very fair, and his blue eyes\r\nlook straight at the spectator. There is a strong likeness between the\r\ntwo. He holds in front of him a paper with the inscription “ANN 1541\r\nETATIS SVÆ 3 10 MARCI.” Both miniatures are painted on a playing card, 2\r\nin. in diameter, and in each the background is the usual bright blue.\r\nTheir pedigree in the royal collection can be traced back as far as\r\nCharles I, in whose catalogue they appear as: “Done by Hans Holbein.\r\nGiven to the King by Sir H. Vane. No. 64. _Item._ Done upon the wrong\r\nlight. Upon a round card, one of the Duke of Brandon’s children, being\r\nin a purple habit laced with red velvet lace, with both his hands before\r\nhim. 2 inches.” “No. 65. _Item._ Another fellow piece of the same Duke\r\nof Brandon’s children, in a black cap and habit with green sleeves,\r\nleaning with his left arm upon the table, bending his breast towards his\r\nleft shoulder, on the table written his age, and the year of our Lord,\r\ndone upon the wrong light.” They appear again in James H’s catalogue,\r\nNo. 646, as: “Two heads in one frame, in limning, being the sons of\r\nCharles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. By Holbein.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 494:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, English translation, p. 371.\r\n\r\nFootnote 495:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 268.

The year date\r\non the elder boy’s portrait has been usually read as 1535. It is so\r\ngiven by Wornum and Woltmann, and other writers have followed them, but\r\nif the portrait represents Henry Brandon, the date is quite impossible.\r\nMary Tudor, the “French Queen,” the Duke of Suffolk’s third wife, died\r\non June 25, 1533, and in September of the same year Brandon married\r\nCatherine Willoughby, the mother of these two boys. In Burke, on the\r\nother hand, it is stated that the marriage took place in 1535; but this\r\nappears to be incorrect. The _Dictionary of National Biography_ gives\r\nthe date of the elder boy’s birth as September 18, 1535, which date is\r\nfixed by the _inquisitio post mortem_ held after his father’s death in\r\n1545; so that it is quite impossible that the lad could have been five\r\nyears old in 1535. Mr. Ernest Law reads the date on the miniature as\r\npossibly 1539; to the writer, however, who has not had the privilege of\r\nexamining the original, it appears, from careful examination of the\r\nexcellent reproduction in Mr. Law’s book, to be either 1543 or 1545, the\r\nthird figure being plainly a 4. Neither of these dates, however, can be\r\ncorrect, and it is quite possible that at some time the inscription,\r\ngrowing illegible, has been repainted, and that in so doing the restorer\r\nhas made a mistake. The lettering on both miniatures lacks the precision\r\nof an original inscription by Holbein. It is generally assumed that the\r\ntwo dates, “6 Sep” and “10 Marci,” refer to the boys’ birthdays, and\r\nthere is no difficulty with regard to the second boy, Charles, who was\r\nborn in March 1538, two and a half years after his brother. The two\r\nminiatures have every appearance of having been painted at about the\r\nsame time, and it is to be expected that the elder of the two would be\r\npainted first. The writer suggests, therefore, that the correct date of\r\nthe portrait of Henry is September 1540, and that of Charles, March\r\n1541.\r\n\r\nThe two boys were very carefully brought up in the Protestant faith by\r\ntheir mother. Martin Bucer, the German reformer, was appointed their\r\ntutor, and they were afterwards in the charge of Thomas Wilson, who\r\nbecame Secretary of State to Queen Elizabeth. At a later period Henry\r\nwas sent to Sir John Cheke, and was educated with Prince Edward, and\r\nfinally entered St. John’s College, Cambridge, where his brother\r\nafterwards followed him. While there the two boys contracted that\r\nscourge of the sixteenth century, the sweating sickness. On the occasion\r\nof the outbreak they were hastily removed for safety to the Bishop of\r\nLincoln’s palace at Brickdon, in Huntingdonshire, but too late, for both\r\ndeveloped the disease, and died together in one bed, on the same day,\r\nJuly 11, 1551, the younger within less than an hour of the elder. Their\r\ndeath at so early an age made an extraordinary impression at the time,\r\nand a pamphlet on the subject was published by their tutor, Dr. Walter\r\nHaddon. Peter Martyr said of Henry that, with the exception of Edward\r\nVI, he was the most promising youth of his day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 32\r\n  STUDY FOR A FAMILY PORTRAIT GROUP\r\n  _Indian-ink wash drawing with brush outline_\r\n  BRITISH MUSEUM\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DRAWING OF A FAMILY GROUP]\r\n\r\nThere is a very beautiful drawing of the boys’ mother in the Windsor\r\nCollection,[497] a head turned three-quarters to the left, wearing the\r\nEnglish angular head-dress with a band of pearls, and a second\r\nornamented band of which part of the pattern has been drawn in detail by\r\nHolbein. The collar is elaborately braided with black velvet, and a\r\nmedallion is indicated at the breast. The brown eyes and the hair have\r\nbeen put in with water-colour. The portrait for which it was the\r\noriginal study has not been traced. There is a replica of this head in\r\nthe British Museum (No. 10),[498] which was formerly in the Robinson and\r\nMalcolm collections. In this connection, too, a second drawing in the\r\nBritish Museum may be cited, which represents a woman and children\r\nsitting on a bench (No. 8) (Pl. 32).[499] It is in Indian-ink on paper,\r\n5¼ in. × 4¼ in., and comes from the Cosway and Utterson collections. It\r\nhas been reproduced by the Vasari Society,[500] with a note by Mr.\r\nCampbell Dodgson, and by Dr. Paul Ganz.[501] Mr. Dodgson suggests that\r\nthe scene represented is the interior of a church. An effect of warm\r\nsunshine is skilfully suggested by the light which falls from a window,\r\nnot seen, on the right. The mother or nurse is seated in the centre of\r\nthe group, on a high-backed bench with panelling of the Tudor “linen”\r\npattern, a baby in long clothes held on her lap. On her right a boy with\r\na flat cap and feather, and puffed sleeves, is seated, his left elbow\r\nresting on the arm of the bench. A little girl stands in front of her,\r\nlooking up, and on the left a younger boy, dressed like his brother, is\r\nstanding, the whole making a group of the greatest charm. It is\r\ndescribed in the British Museum Catalogue as an admirable example of\r\nHolbein’s earlier Basel period, but it is evidently of later date, and\r\nthe costumes are undoubtedly English. It has been recently suggested by\r\nMr. Peartree that the woman is “Mother Jack,” nurse to Prince\r\nEdward.[502] In features and costume she bears considerable likeness to\r\nthe unnamed drawing in the Windsor Collection,[503] which is supposed to\r\nbe a portrait of that nurse. If this supposition be correct, the baby\r\nwould be the Prince of Wales, and the date of the drawing about 1537;\r\nbut this fails to account for the three other children. Dr. Ganz\r\nconsiders it to be a group of members of the Brandon family,[504] and as\r\nfar as the two boys are concerned, this suggestion has something in its\r\nfavour. The lad on the right is by no means unlike Henry Brandon. The\r\nposition of the head and the left arm are exactly the same as in the\r\nminiature, and the dress has many points of resemblance. The second boy,\r\ntoo, has some likeness to Charles, though he does not wear the\r\nvelvet-braided costume of the miniature. Again, however, there is a\r\nstumbling-block to this theory in the presence of the two younger\r\nchildren, for the Duke’s family by his fourth wife consisted of the two\r\nboys only. By his second marriage with Anne, daughter of Sir Anthony\r\nBrowne, he had two daughters, Anne, afterwards Lady Powys, and Mary,\r\nafterwards Lady Monteagle, and by his third wife, the King’s sister, he\r\nhad two other daughters, Frances, afterwards Countess of Dorset, and\r\nEleanor, afterwards Countess of Cumberland, but these ladies were all\r\ntoo old for one of them to have been the little girl represented in the\r\ndrawing. Owing, no doubt, to the wrong date on the miniature of Henry\r\nBrandon, Dr. Ganz ascribes this drawing to the year 1535, and sees signs\r\nin the elder boy’s face of approaching illness, although no such illness\r\nis recorded until the sudden one in 1551, when he was nearly sixteen.\r\nBoth explanations are ingenious, but neither is entirely satisfactory.\r\nOn the margin of the drawing, in a later hand, is written—“exaltate\r\nCedrus. H. Holbein,” which, apparently, is a reference to Ecclesiasticus\r\nxxiv. 17, “Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libano.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 497:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 334; Wornum, ii. 21; Holmes, i. 26.

Pierpont Morgan’s collection (No. iv.), which bears in every\r\ntouch the unapproachable skill and rare individuality of the artist. It\r\nwas formerly in the collection of Mr. C. Heywood Hawkins, and at his\r\nsale on May 15, 1904, realised £2750, afterwards passing into the\r\npossession of Mr. Morgan, by whose courtesy it is reproduced in this\r\nbook. In the Hawkins Sale-Catalogue it was described as the portrait of\r\nFrances Howard, Duchess of Norfolk, but without authority, for there was\r\nno Duchess of Norfolk of that name in Holbein’s time. When exhibited by\r\nMr. Hawkins at South Kensington in 1865, it was described in the\r\ncatalogue as merely—“Portrait of a Lady, Anno Aetatis Suae 23. Her coat\r\nof arms is affixed to the case.” This coat, described by Sir Richard\r\nHolmes in the _Burlington Magazine_,[506] in a note accompanying a\r\nreproduction of the portrait, is dated MDLVI, and in style and painting\r\nis about a century later than the miniature. These arms, as Sir Richard\r\nfirst pointed out, are those of the Pemberton family. Further\r\nresearches, undertaken by Dr. Williamson, and embodied in his catalogue\r\nof Mr. Pierpont Morgan’s Miniatures, prove, almost without doubt, that\r\nthe lady represented was Mrs. Robert Pemberton. He says: “The arms of\r\nthe wyverns’ heads which are quartered with those of Pemberton belong to\r\nthe family of Jago di Lago, gentleman, of Newcastle-under-Lyme,\r\nStaffordshire; and Robert Pemberton, of Rushden, Northants, M.P. for\r\nNorthampton in 1478, married Alice, daughter and co-heir of this Jago di\r\nLago.... Major-General R. C. B. Pemberton, to whom I am indebted for\r\nthese interesting references, is of opinion that the lady in the\r\nminiature is Margaret, daughter of Richard Throgmorton, of Higham Park,\r\nco. Northants, who was buried at Rushden, 27th October 1576. She married\r\nRobert Pemberton, of Pemberton, co. Lancs., and of Rushden, eldest son\r\nof William Pemberton, of the same places, and he died in September 1594.\r\nThe arms would be those of this Robert Pemberton, whose grandfather\r\ncertainly bore them.”[507]\r\n\r\nFootnote 505:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in Mr. Morgan’s Catalogue, Pl. iv., No. 2, and in colour in\r\n  _édition de luxe_, No. 4; _Burlington Magazine_, vol. v., July 1904,\r\n  frontispiece; _Portrait Miniatures_ (_Studio_ Spring No.), 1910, Pl.\r\n  i.; _Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition Catalogue_, 1909, Pl.\r\n  xxxii.; Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 148 (3); _Connoisseur_, Dec. 1906.\r\n\r\nFootnote 506:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. v., July 1904, p. 337.\r\n\r\nFootnote 507:\r\n\r\n  Williamson, Mr. J.

PIERPONT MORGAN’S COLLECTION\r\n\r\n  PORTRAIT OF HOLBEIN BY HIMSELF\r\n  WALLACE COLLECTION\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINIATURE OF AN UNKNOWN YOUTH]\r\n\r\nIn this very beautiful little masterpiece the lady is shown\r\nthree-quarters face to the right, wearing a black velvet bodice and\r\nsmall white linen cape, and a lawn collar and cuffs, embroidered with a\r\ngeometrical design in black. She has a red carnation fastened in her\r\ndress, and round her neck a thin black cord with gold filigree ends, and\r\nholds a single green leaf in her crossed hands. Her hair, which is\r\nparted in the centre, is almost concealed beneath her white linen cap.\r\nThe background is, as usual, blue, and across it, in gold letters, runs\r\nthe inscription, “ANNO ETATIS SVÆ 23.” It is painted on the back of a\r\nplaying card, and is still in its original frame, decorated with white\r\nand black enamel and three pearls.\r\n\r\nThe miniature in the Queen of Holland’s collection (Pl. 31 (5)) equals,\r\nif it does not surpass, in the brilliance and delicacy of its execution\r\nand in the subtlety of its characterisation, the portrait of Mrs.\r\nPemberton; in some ways, indeed, it is the most perfect example of\r\nHolbein’s mastery of this branch of art which remains. Its discovery was\r\ndue to Sir Richard Holmes, who, in 1903, first attributed it to Holbein,\r\nin a communication to the _Burlington Magazine_,[508] accompanied by a\r\nreproduction of the miniature. It forms one of a collection of some four\r\nhundred, of which about fifty are of English origin, in the royal\r\ncollections of Holland at the Hague. It represents a youth of about\r\nfifteen or sixteen, who so far has not been identified. The head and\r\nshoulders only are shown, turned three-quarters to the spectator’s\r\nright, the eyes cast down. The hair is cut close, and the dress is a\r\nbrown doublet trimmed with black, with a small open, falling collar with\r\nwhite strings attached. There is no inscription on the background. With\r\nthe exception of slight discoloration of the collar through the\r\noxidization of the pigment, this miniature is in faultless condition.\r\n“Its extraordinary power and beauty,” says Sir Richard, “were manifest\r\nat first sight, and a close examination has convinced me that it can be\r\nattributed only to Holbein, of whose work in this branch of portraiture\r\nI have long been a student, as well as of his crayon drawings. It has\r\nall the restraint of power so characteristic of him, and the exquisite\r\ndelicacy of line combined with firmness and precision, which never\r\nunited in the same degree in any master with whose work I am\r\nacquainted.”[509] The same writer suggested that it is possibly the\r\nportrait of a member of the family of one of the German merchants of the\r\nSteelyard. The facial characteristics, however, appear to be more\r\nEnglish than German, and it most probably represents the son of some\r\npersonage about Henry’s court. It was exhibited at the Exhibition of\r\nMiniatures in Rotterdam in 1910, and again at Brussels in 1912 (No.\r\n846). Another fine miniature in the Queen of Holland’s collection, the\r\nportrait of an unknown man in black (Brussels Exhibition, No. 847), was\r\nfirst pointed out by Dr. Williamson in his _History of Portrait\r\nMiniatures_ as very probably the work of Holbein; and since its\r\nexhibition at Brussels in 1912 the attribution has been accepted by some\r\nof the leading Dutch critics.[510]\r\n\r\nFootnote 508:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. i., April 1903, p. 218, and frontispiece;\r\n  Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 147 (2).\r\n\r\nFootnote 509:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. i., April 1903, p. 218.\r\n\r\nFootnote 510:\r\n\r\n  See _Hist. Portrait Miniatures_, vol. i. p. 11, and Pl. iii. 1.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN’S MINIATURES OF HIMSELF]\r\n\r\nA fine miniature portrait of the artist himself, painted in the last\r\nyear of his life, is in the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch,[511]\r\nand was exhibited at the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, 1879 (Case F,\r\n25), and at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1909 (Case C, 23). It is a\r\nbust portrait, turned three-quarters to the left, the head facing the\r\nspectator. He is represented in the act of painting, the left hand\r\nsupporting the right, and is dressed in a plain black costume with white\r\npleated collar and cuffs, and a round black skull-cap. He has dark hair\r\nand a closely-cut beard. Across the blue background is inscribed, “H.H.\r\nAN. 1543. ÆTATIS SVÆ 45.” It was formerly in the collection of Horace\r\nWalpole, and at the Strawberry Hill sale in 1842 was purchased by Mr. W.\r\nBlamire, and when the latter’s collection was disposed of in 1863 it\r\npassed into the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch. It is one of the\r\nbest of several similar miniatures, and is very fine in execution, and\r\nhas been usually ascribed to Holbein himself. The best of all is in the\r\nWallace Collection (Case B, 93) (Pl. 33 (2)),[512] and appears to be\r\nfrom the painter’s own hand. A number of copies are to be found in\r\nvarious collections; one of them, in the Mayer van den Bergh Collection,\r\nAntwerp, is reproduced by Dr. Ganz.[513] Woltmann considered that the\r\nMontagu House portrait was “scarcely the original, but an old and\r\ncontemporaneous copy,”[514] but it is too excellent in execution to be\r\nthe work of a mere copyist. There is a second and larger version in the\r\nBuccleuch Collection, with the same date, 1543, also attributed to\r\nHolbein. The first-named example may possibly be the small round\r\nmentioned by Van Mander as being in Amsterdam in his day. Lucas\r\nVorsterman’s circular engraving was evidently based on this miniature or\r\nthe somewhat larger portrait now lost,[515] of which the exceedingly\r\npoor likeness of the painter in the Uffizi Gallery gives but a feeble\r\necho. The print follows the miniature closely, but is reversed, so that\r\nHolbein is represented as painting with his left hand. Hollar’s\r\nengraving, dated 1647, in which the painter’s left hand is omitted, was\r\ntaken, according to the inscription, from an original in the collection\r\nof the Earl of Arundel, though Wornum was of opinion that it was based\r\nupon Vorsterman’s version. Both are described in an earlier\r\nchapter.[516] The inscription across the background in Hollar’s\r\nprint—“HH. Æ 45. AN^O 1543”—agrees with the second miniature in the\r\nBuccleuch Collection. Van Mander states that Holbein painted with his\r\nleft hand, and in this Sandrart and Patin follow him, but that this was\r\na legend is proved by the original miniature in which the artist has\r\nrepresented himself holding his brush. Vorsterman’s engraving, which\r\nappears to bear out Van Mander’s statement, through his failure to\r\nreverse his drawing on the wood block, if not the original source of the\r\nerror, may have helped to spread it. Sir George Scharf, however,\r\nsuggested another cause as the source of this tradition. “Most of the\r\nportraits of Henry VIII,” he says, “more especially those attributed to\r\nHolbein, have the light coming in from the spectator’s right, a\r\ncircumstance which may have tended, in some degree, to establish the\r\ntradition that Holbein was left-handed. These are specified by Van der\r\nDort as done upon the wrong light.”[517]\r\n\r\nFootnote 511:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 371 (9).

C.\r\nWilliamson in 1911,[518] and is one of exceptional interest, as it is an\r\nundoubted likeness of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, K.G. (Pl. 31 (6)).\r\nIt came from a private source, and is now in the late Mr. Pierpont\r\nMorgan’s collection. It was fully described, and compared with other\r\nportraits of Cromwell, by Mr. Lionel Cust in the _Burlington\r\nMagazine_.[519] He is represented in a black cloak with fur collar,\r\nblack cloth cap, and wearing the chain of the Garter with the pendant\r\nGeorge. The background is blue. It is about two inches in diameter,\r\npainted on vellum or chicken-skin, pasted on card. “It is encased,” says\r\nMr. Cust, “in an ivory box, carved on the back with a rose and other\r\nornaments, similar to, though in no way so fine or so rich as, the ivory\r\nbox which contains the miniature portrait of Anne of Cleves, lately\r\nbequeathed to the nation by Mr. George Salting, and now in the Victoria\r\nand Albert Museum. In the case, however, of Mr. Morgan’s portrait of\r\nCromwell, the lower half of the box has been separated from the lid, cut\r\ndown, and set in a gold frame, which is ornamented by a series of small\r\ndeformed pearls. This gold framework is the work of a highly-efficient\r\ngoldsmith, but hardly seems to date from the days of Henry VIII.” As\r\nCromwell is shown wearing the Garter chain and badge, of which order he\r\nwas made a knight in August 1537, the miniature was no doubt painted at\r\nsome date between August and December in that year, to commemorate his\r\nelection. In this connection it is of interest to note that in\r\nCromwell’s accounts, preserved in the Record Office, there is an entry\r\nunder 4th January 1538: “Hanns the painter, 40_s._”[520] This payment\r\nwould suggest that, in all probability, Holbein presented him with this\r\nminiature as a New Year’s gift, and that in return he received the forty\r\nshillings from his old patron as an acknowledgment.[521] The miniature\r\nis thus some three or four years later in date than the portrait at\r\nTyttenhanger, painted not later than the spring of 1534, when he was\r\nMaster of the Jewel House.[522]\r\n\r\nFootnote 518:\r\n\r\n  Communicated by him to _The Times_, 25th May 1911.\r\n\r\nFootnote 519:\r\n\r\n  “A Newly-discovered Miniature of Thomas Cromwell,” vol. xx., October\r\n  1911, pp. 5, 6. The miniature reproduced p. 7 (1). Since the date of\r\n  this article Dr. Williamson has traced back the history of this\r\n  miniature to a member of the Cromwell family who settled and died near\r\n  Munich.\r\n\r\nFootnote 520:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xiv., pt. ii., 782 (f. 117).\r\n\r\nFootnote 521:\r\n\r\n  See _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xx., December 1911, p. 175.\r\n\r\nFootnote 522:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 58-60.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINIATURES OF HENRY VIII]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this miniature has suffered severely during its past\r\ncareer, and has been so rubbed down that little of the details of the\r\ndress or ornaments can now be distinguished beyond the mere outlines.\r\n“The face,” says Mr. Cust, “is faded and also rubbed, but here the\r\nskilful drawing of the features reveals a master-hand which could be no\r\nother but Holbein’s. Very subtle, however, and recognizable are the\r\ndistinctive features of Thomas Cromwell, the vulgar nose, with its\r\nsunken bridge, the cunning eyes with the puckered skin at their\r\ncorners.”[523]\r\n\r\nFootnote 523:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xx., October 1911, p. 5.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this book does not permit any detailed description of the\r\nvery numerous miniatures of Henry VIII and the members of his family\r\nwhich are to be found in various collections in England, the more\r\nimportant of which have been publicly exhibited from time to time. In\r\nthe royal collection in Windsor Castle there are four of the King\r\nhimself, but none of them can be given to Holbein. Three of them appear\r\nto have been painted immediately before Holbein’s first visit to\r\nEngland, and the fourth shortly after his death. Two, in which Henry is\r\nbeardless, and of youthful appearance, were in Charles I’s collection,\r\nand are entered in his catalogue as being among “the limned pictures\r\nwhich my Lord of Suffolk gave to the King.” One of them is inscribed, in\r\ntwo lines, “H.R. VIII. AN^O ETATIS XXXV^O,” which gives the date as\r\n1525-6; the other, which it resembles closely, has no date, but merely\r\n“REX HENRICUS. OCTAVVS.”[524] The third Windsor miniature is inscribed\r\n“H.R. VIII. AN^O XXXV.” In the spandrils four golden angels, on a bright\r\nred ground, are holding the letters H and K in golden cords, and linked\r\nwith true-lovers’ knots. Sir George Scharf considered these initials to\r\nrefer to the King’s last marriage, on July 12, 1543, with Catherine\r\nParr, and the “XXXV^O” as referring, not to Henry’s age, but to his\r\nregnal year. “The face,” he says, “at first sight looks youthful, but it\r\nis fat, and, on careful inspection, has a worn and very artificial\r\nappearance, as if means had been employed to conceal age.”[525] Mr.\r\nWornum, on the other hand, considered the numerals to refer to the\r\nKing’s actual age, and not to his reign, and the initial K to Katherine\r\nof Aragon.[526] It is only possible to say of the earlier of these\r\nminiatures that they are not the work of Holbein. As to the real author\r\nof them, the name of one or other member of the Hornebolt family can\r\nonly be tentatively given, without any real proof in support of it,\r\nbeyond the fact that the Hornebolts were settled in this country before\r\n1526, the name appearing in the accounts of the expenses of the royal\r\nhousehold in that year, and that there appears to have been no other\r\nforeign artist of like importance living in London at that date. Mr.\r\nLionel Cust, in the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition Catalogue,\r\nsuggests the name of Jehan Perréal, or Jehan de Paris, as the possible\r\nauthor of some of the early portraits in miniature of the King, painted\r\nbefore Holbein’s arrival in England. Perréal was over here at the time\r\nof the marriage of Louis XII, whose official painter he was, with\r\nPrincess Mary Tudor, for the purpose of designing the new Queen’s\r\ndresses. His visit, however, could have been but a short one, and does\r\nnot account for miniatures of the year 1526.\r\n\r\nFootnote 524:\r\n\r\n  Both reproduced by Law, _Holbein’s Pictures at Windsor Castle_, Pl.\r\n  vii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 525:\r\n\r\n  “Remarks on Some Portraits from Windsor Castle, Hampton Court, and\r\n  Wilton House,” _Archæologia_, vol. xxxix., 1863, p. 252.\r\n\r\nFootnote 526:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 281.\r\n\r\nThe fourth miniature of the King at Windsor is in oils on oak, 2¾ in. in\r\ndiameter, in which he is wearing a thin beard and whiskers. It is\r\ninscribed, “HENR. 8 REX. ANGL. ÆTA. S: 57.” Its date, therefore, must\r\nrefer to the last year of the King’s reign, 1546, though there is a\r\nmistake in the age, as he never entered his fifty-seventh year.\r\nAccording to Charles I’s catalogue, it was “supposed to be done by\r\nHolben, and given to the King by my Lord Suffolk.” In type it\r\ncorresponds very closely to the portrait of Henry in St. Bartholomew’s\r\nHospital, London. There is yet another miniature of the King at Windsor,\r\nby Nicholas Hilliard, which appears to have been copied from some lost\r\noriginal by Holbein or by Hornebolt. It is one of the customary\r\nfull-face versions, with beard, and is one of the four fine miniatures\r\nwhich were appended to an elaborate jewel which Hilliard executed in\r\nenamels and gold, possibly for Edward VI, representing the Battle of\r\nBosworth Field, which was bought by Charles I from Laurence Hilliard,\r\nthe painter’s son. The three other miniatures represent Henry VII, Jane\r\nSeymour, evidently copied from the well-known portrait by Holbein, and\r\nEdward VI, which recalls more than one of the portraits of the young\r\nKing usually attributed to Guillim Stretes. The one of Henry VIII is\r\ninscribed in gold: “1536. ÆTATIS SVÆ 46.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINIATURES OF HENRY VIII]\r\n\r\nNo less than five miniatures of the King were lent to the Burlington\r\nFine Arts Club Exhibition by the Duke of Buccleuch, two of which are\r\nattributed to Holbein. One is a reduced copy of Holbein’s portrait of\r\nHenry belonging to Earl Spencer (Case C, 6). A second[527] is inscribed\r\n“H.R. VIII. AN^O XXXV,” and appears to be the original from which the\r\nWindsor miniature, described above, was copied (Case C, 7). It was\r\nformerly in the Magniac Collection. The catalogue suggests that it is\r\npossibly the work of an illuminator of the French school. A third (Case\r\nC, 25), with a very similar inscription, is evidently a second copy of\r\nthe same miniature. The fourth (Case C, 8 (D)), forms one of a series of\r\neight in an ebony frame, which were formerly in the collection of\r\nCharles I. It is a full-face, with grey beard, and, according to the\r\nroyal catalogue, was “done by Hans Holbein, given to the King by my Lord\r\nSuffolk.”[528] The companion miniatures represent Henry VII, Elizabeth\r\nof York (“copied by Hoskins after an ancient ould coloured piece”),\r\nKatherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn (also copied by John Hoskins “after an\r\nould colured piece”), Queen Mary (“done by Ant. More”), Edward VI, and\r\nQueen Elizabeth (“done by Old Hilliard”). The “Henry VIII” is fine, and\r\nin the Burlington catalogue is attributed to Holbein, but it is more\r\nprobably another copy from “an ould coloured piece” by the master. It\r\nhas considerable resemblance to the fifth miniature from Montagu\r\nHouse[529] (Case C, 2), also ascribed to Holbein, but not by him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 527:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in the _Burlington Fine Arts Club Catalogue_, Pl. xxxiii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 528:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Williamson, _Hist. Portrait Miniatures_, Pl. ii. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 529:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in the _Burlington Fine Arts Club Catalogue_, Pl. xxxiii.\r\n\r\nThe very fine miniature portrait of the King in the Pierpont Morgan\r\nCollection was included in the same exhibition (Case B, 1).[530] Old\r\ntradition says that this portrait was presented by the King himself to\r\nAnne of Cleves. Tradition in this case may be correct, though this Queen\r\nis the least likely of all to have been the recipient of such a gift.\r\nThe correspondence with reference to the suggested marriages with the\r\nDuchess of Longueville, the Duchess of Milan, and Anne herself, shows\r\nthat Henry always refused to send a portrait of himself while such\r\nnegotiations were in progress. His anxiety was to see a portrait of the\r\nlady first, and, if possible, the lady herself, before making his final\r\ndecision, and to send one of himself before such final decision had been\r\nmade would have been too compromising. It is not likely, therefore, that\r\nhe sent one to Anne in Düren, and as he took the strongest aversion to\r\nher directly he saw her, it is still less probable that she received a\r\ngift of so personal a nature after she arrived in England. Dr.\r\nWilliamson, in his catalogue of Mr. Morgan’s miniatures, gives a very\r\ninteresting account of the history of this fine little portrait,[531]\r\nand the companion one of Anne of Cleves, both at one time in the\r\npossession of the Barrett family, of Lee Priory, Kent, and later in that\r\nof the Meyricks, of Goodrich Court, to which reference has been made in\r\nan earlier chapter.[532] Some years before the death of General Meyrick,\r\nwho had succeeded to the Goodrich Court Collection, the miniature of\r\nHenry VIII disappeared, and was supposed to have been stolen. It is said\r\nto have travelled as far as Vienna, but four years or so after General\r\nMeyrick’s death it reappeared in England, and was repurchased for the\r\nfamily, from whom, in 1906, it was acquired by Mr. Morgan.\r\n\r\nFootnote 530:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 157.

Henry wears a black cap trimmed with jewels, loops of\r\npearls, and a white feather, a brown fur coat over a grey doublet\r\nembroidered with black, a narrow white collar, and a gold chain round\r\nhis neck. There is no inscription on the blue background. It is 1¼ in.\r\nin diameter, and is still preserved within its original turned ivory\r\nbox, ornamented at top and bottom with the Tudor rose, and covered with\r\na piece of rock crystal. There is some resemblance between it and the\r\ncrayon drawing of the King at Munich, and, in the details of the\r\ncostume, to the large cartoon at Chatsworth and the full-face portrait\r\nin Windsor Castle, which has been considered by some critics to be a\r\ncopy of a lost picture by Holbein, and by others as an original portrait\r\nby some such court painter as Lucas Hornebolt. The differences in the\r\ncostume are slight, and the dress is in its main features the same. Fine\r\nas this miniature is, it is difficult to ascribe it to Holbein himself;\r\nit is more probably only an excellent old copy of a lost original, or\r\nthe work of some capable miniaturist adapted from one of Holbein’s\r\npaintings.\r\n\r\nThe miniature of Anne of Cleves, which is slightly larger than the one\r\nof Henry VIII, and is enclosed within a similar turned ivory box\r\ndelicately carved to represent a Tudor rose, has been already\r\ndescribed.[533] It is of the finest workmanship, and may be given to\r\nHolbein with little hesitation. It was included in the Burlington Club\r\nExhibition, 1909 (Case B, 4), and the catalogue states that in all\r\nprobability it was painted in July 1539, at Düren. Holbein’s visit to\r\nthat place was of longer duration than was usual when he was sent to\r\ntake likenesses of the ladies who were candidates for Henry’s hand.[534]\r\nAs a rule, he only remained just long enough to make a study in coloured\r\ncrayons, but he stayed at Düren for a week or two, and so may have had\r\ntime to paint both the large portrait and the miniature, though it must\r\nbe remembered that he also painted or drew the lady’s sister, the\r\nPrincess Amelia. It is much more probable that the miniature was taken\r\nfrom the larger portrait, or that both were done from some lost crayon\r\nstudy, than that the Louvre picture should have been painted from the\r\nminiature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 533:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 181-182.\r\n\r\nFootnote 534:\r\n\r\n  See p. 176.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINIATURES OF JANE SEYMOUR]\r\n\r\nThere are several miniatures of Queen Jane Seymour in existence, in most\r\ncases attributed to Holbein, all, with one exception, closely following\r\nthe portrait of that Queen in the Vienna Gallery, upon which they are\r\nevidently based. Among the best are two which were in the Burlington\r\nFine Arts Club Exhibition, lent by Mr. Vernon Watney and by the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch. The former (Case B, 2),[535] inscribed merely “A^ON XXV,” is\r\nsaid to have belonged originally to the Seymour family, and to have been\r\ngiven by Charles, Duke of Somerset, to his granddaughter, Elizabeth\r\nWyndham, wife of the Right Hon. George Grenville, from whom it passed\r\ninto the possession of the Duke of Buckingham. It was afterwards in the\r\nSackville Bale and Lumsden Propert collections. Sir George Scharf\r\nconsidered this miniature to be a portrait of Anne Boleyn, and regarded\r\nthe “XXV” as the King’s regnal date, and not as that of the lady’s\r\nage;[536] but the likeness to Jane Seymour is stronger, though not very\r\nmarked. Mr. C. F. Bell points out[537] that the likeness of the sitter\r\nto Lady Hemingham or Heveningham (“Henegham”), as she is represented in\r\nthe fine drawing at Windsor,[538] is much more pronounced, and he\r\nsuggests that the miniature was painted from the portrait of that lady,\r\ntaken from the drawing, which has now disappeared. Mr. Watney’s\r\nminiature, however, closely resembles the one belonging to the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch (Case C, 5),[539] though the latter has no inscription and the\r\npendant jewel set with large pearls is absent. This last portrait\r\nbelonged to Horace Walpole, and by him was regarded as representing\r\nKatherine of Aragon, and under that name it passed from the Strawberry\r\nHill sale into the hands of Mr. Blamire, and afterwards into its present\r\nownership. It appears to be, however, an undoubted portrait of Henry’s\r\nthird queen. Another miniature of Jane Seymour was lent to the same\r\nexhibition by Mr. H. Dent-Brocklehurst (Case B, 6),[540] attributed like\r\nthe others to Holbein, which was also formerly in the possession of\r\nHorace Walpole. The portrait of this queen is also among the four\r\nminiatures attached to the enamelled jewel, of Nicholas Hilliard’s\r\nworkmanship, in the royal collection at Windsor, mentioned above. It is\r\ninscribed “ANŌ DNĪ 1536 ÆTATIS SVÆ 27,” which no doubt appeared on the\r\noriginal miniature by Holbein, now lost, from which all these others are\r\nalso derived.\r\n\r\nFootnote 535:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in the _Burlington Fine Arts Club Catalogue_, Pl. xxxii.;\r\n  Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 148 (1).\r\n\r\nFootnote 536:\r\n\r\n  _Archæologia_, vol. xl., 1866, p. 81.\r\n\r\nFootnote 537:\r\n\r\n  In a communication to Dr. Ganz.

A miniature in the possession of Mr. H. Dent-Brocklehurst,\r\nlent by him to the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition (Case B, 7), is\r\nsaid to represent this Queen and to be by Holbein, but both attributions\r\nare probably incorrect. It is inscribed “ANO XXXII,” and if this is to\r\nbe read as the regnal year, it must have been painted between April 1540\r\nand April 1541, and, if it represents this Queen, more than two years\r\nbefore her marriage. She wears a scarlet, black, and white circular\r\nFrench hood with black fall, and cloth of gold dress. Sir George Scharf\r\nconsidered it to be a portrait of Catherine Howard.[542]\r\n\r\nFootnote 541:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 192-193.\r\n\r\nFootnote 542:\r\n\r\n  _Archæologia_, vol. xl., 1866, p. 84.\r\n\r\nSeveral miniatures of Edward VI exist—there are three in the Buccleuch\r\nCollection—though not one has been so far discovered from the hand of\r\nHolbein himself. Most of them represent the boy at a period after\r\nHolbein’s death, and the name of Guillim Stretes has been suggested as\r\ntheir author.[543] The beautiful little circular drawing of the Prince,\r\nat a very early age, in the Basel Gallery,[544] is apparently Holbein’s\r\nfirst study for a miniature which has now disappeared, and may have been\r\nthe “portrait of the Prince’s Grace” which the artist presented to Henry\r\nVIII on New Year’s Day, 1539.[545]\r\n\r\nFootnote 543:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 168-189.\r\n\r\nFootnote 544:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 110 (82).\r\n\r\nFootnote 545:\r\n\r\n  See p. 164.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIVINA TEERLINC]\r\n\r\nCertain of these miniatures, and others not described here, some of them\r\napparently copies after Holbein, while others are original works, were\r\nno doubt produced by Susanna Hornebolt, Livina[546] Teerlinc, and\r\nStretes, all three of whom were in turn much employed about the court,\r\nand enjoyed royal pay. It has been impossible, so far, to separate the\r\nworks of these artists, or to find any starting-point in the shape of a\r\nsigned miniature from which any judgment of their particular methods and\r\nstyle can be formed. What little is known of Susanna Hornebolt has been\r\ngiven in an early chapter. Livina Teerlinc, eldest daughter of the\r\nminiaturist, Simon Binnink of Bruges, married George Teerlinc of\r\nBlankenberghe, near Bruges, and after the death of her husband’s father,\r\nin 1545, they came to England.[547] She is mentioned by Vasari in a\r\nshort passage as “Levina, daughter of the above-named Master Simon of\r\nBruges, who was nobly married in England by Henry VIII, was held in\r\ngreat esteem by Queen Mary, and is now in much favour with Queen\r\nElizabeth,” an account which Guicciardini copies and slightly\r\nelaborates.[548] Her name does not occur in the royal accounts, however,\r\nuntil Midsummer, 1547, under Edward VI, when, as “maistris Levyn Terling\r\npaintrix,” she received a quarter’s wages of £10. She held the same\r\nappointment under Mary and Elizabeth and at the same salary, £40 a year.\r\nOn New Year’s Day, 1556, she presented Queen Mary with a small picture\r\nof the Trinity, and two years later her New Year’s gift to Queen\r\nElizabeth was a portrait of her Majesty “finely painted upon a card,”\r\nfor which she received in return a silver-gilt casting-bottle weighing\r\n2¾ oz. In 1561, on a like occasion, there was given to the same Queen,\r\n“By Mrs. Levina Terling, the Queenes personne and other personnages in a\r\nbox fynely painted,” which so pleased Elizabeth that she retained it in\r\nher own keeping, and gave “Maistris Levyn Terling” in return a\r\nsilver-gilt covered salt-cellar weighing 5½ oz.[549] George Teerlinc\r\nreturned to Bruges, and died there before 25th August 1580; and Mr.\r\nWeale conjectures that his wife died before him, probably in England,\r\nbut there is no documentary evidence of this. In any case, Vasari, and\r\nGuicciardini after him, were wrong in stating that while at the English\r\ncourt she was “nobly married.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 546:\r\n\r\n  Also spelt Levina.\r\n\r\nFootnote 547:\r\n\r\n  See Weale, _Burlington Magazine_, vol. viii., February 1906, p. 356.\r\n\r\nFootnote 548:\r\n\r\n  The latter says: “Levina, figliuola di maestro Simone di Bruggia già\r\n  mentionato, la quale nel miniare come il padre è tanto felice et\r\n  eccellente, che il prefato Henrice Re d’Inghilterra la volle con ogni\r\n  premio haver’ a ogni modo alla sua corte, ove fu poi maritata\r\n  nobilmente, fu molto amata dalla Regina Maria, et hora è amatissima\r\n  dalla Regina Elisabetta.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 549:\r\n\r\n  See J. Gough Nichols, _Archæologia_, xxxix. pp. 39-40.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Livina, as with Susanna Hornebolt, it is impossible to\r\npoint with certainty to any work as being indubitably from her hand. The\r\ntwo beautiful miniatures in the Salting Collection representing two\r\nlittle girls, sisters, aged five and four respectively, which were\r\nformerly in the collection of Mr. C. H. T. Hawkins, were attributed by\r\nboth these owners to Livina Teerlinc, and were so described in the\r\ncatalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition (Case B, 5).[550]\r\nThe richness of the costume indicates that they were the children of\r\nsome important personage about the court. Each one is dated “ANO DNI\r\n1590,” and they are enclosed in a contemporary turned ivory case. Dr.\r\nWilliamson states that at one time they had attached to them “a strip of\r\nparchment on which was recorded, in handwriting undoubtedly\r\ncontemporary, that the two little portraits were ‘fynely’ painted by\r\nLavina Teerlinc in 1590 at Greenwich.”[551] It is impossible however,\r\nthat miniatures painted in 1590 can be her work if Mr. Weale’s\r\nconjecture[552] that she died before 1580 is correct; but Dr.\r\nWilliamson, who has been good enough to re-examine his notes, made when\r\nthe miniatures were in the Hawkins collection, is now of opinion that\r\nthe date on the parchment is not 1590, but 1570. The third figure is\r\nindistinct, but appears to be 7. If this is so, the attribution of these\r\ncharming little works to Livina is very probably a true one, and the\r\nartist may still have predeceased her husband, as Mr. Weale surmises.\r\nThere is an interesting miniature in Earl Spencer’s collection, signed\r\nwith an “L,” and dated 1526, a double portrait, said to represent Sir\r\nJohn Boling and his mother, though the couple appear to be man and wife,\r\nwhich has been ascribed by some writers to Lucas d’Heere, though the\r\ndate, of course, makes such authorship impossible. Mr. J. J. Foster[553]\r\nstates that when he examined it he thought he could discern a “T”\r\nfollowing the “L,” and suggests that it was the work of Livina Teerlinc;\r\nbut this is equally impossible, for, according to Mr. Weale’s\r\nresearches, she and her husband did not reach England until about 1545,\r\nwhile in 1526 she must have been a mere child.\r\n\r\nFootnote 550:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in _Burlington Fine Arts Club Catalogue_, Pl. xxxii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 551:\r\n\r\n  Williamson, _History of Portrait Miniatures_, vol. i., Addendum, p.\r\n  xx.\r\n\r\nFootnote 552:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. viii., February 1906, p. 356, and vol.\r\n  ix., July 1906, p. 278.\r\n\r\nFootnote 553:\r\n\r\n  _British Miniature Painters_, 1898, p. 14 and Pl. v.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINIATURE OF KRATZER]\r\n\r\nThere are several very interesting miniatures in the Pierpont Morgan\r\nCollection which, although they cannot be given to Holbein himself, are\r\ncertainly of his school and period. One of the finest represents a\r\nBaseler named Arnold Franz, a man with a brown beard and moustache,\r\ndressed in black.[554] It is in a richly-enamelled gold frame with\r\npendant pearls, and the sitter’s age, “AET. 32,” enamelled on the front,\r\nand on the reverse, “Arnold Franz, Holbein Pinx.” It was procured at the\r\nsale of a collection in Basel, and was stated to have been in the\r\npossession of the descendants of the sitter ever since it was painted.\r\nThere was also an unbroken family tradition that Holbein himself had\r\npainted it, and that Franz, said to have been a printer and a friend of\r\nFroben’s, was intimately acquainted with the artist. The Franz family,\r\nnow extinct, are also said to have possessed for many years a letter\r\nfrom Holbein to his friend, in which the miniature is mentioned, but the\r\ndocument has been lost.[555] A second miniature in Mr. Morgan’s\r\ncollection is a portrait of Niklaus Kratzer, and is evidently by the\r\nsame hand as the one of Arnold Franz. It is not a reduced version of the\r\nLouvre picture, which was painted in 1528, but appears, in Dr.\r\nWilliamson’s opinion, to have been painted some years earlier than that\r\ndate, though, if that be the case, it is not very likely that Holbein\r\nwas its author. The face is nearly in profile, to the left, and the\r\nastronomer is wearing the customary fur-lined black coat and black cap,\r\nand a gold chain round his neck. In his hand he holds a brass armillary\r\nsphere. A third miniature, in the same possession, which has\r\nconsiderable affinity in style to the two just mentioned, represents\r\nCharles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. It was formerly in the possession of\r\nthe royal house of Holland, and afterwards in the Propert and Tomkinson\r\ncollections. Dr. Williamson suggests that some of the Holbeinesque\r\nminiatures, such as these, which exist in considerable numbers, may have\r\nbeen the work of Hans Mielich (1515-1572), of Munich, who painted\r\nportraits and miniatures of some merit, and was for a time court painter\r\nto the Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria. There is no record, however, of any\r\nvisit paid by him to England. Others may be possibly the work of such\r\npainters as Thomas and John Bettes and Guillim Stretes, who are dealt\r\nwith in a succeeding chapter.[556]\r\n\r\nFootnote 554:\r\n\r\n  Pierpont Morgan Catalogue, No. 3, and Pl. iii., No. 1, and colour\r\n  plate, _édition de luxe_, No. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 555:\r\n\r\n  Williamson, _History of Portrait Miniatures_, vol. i., Addendum, p.\r\n  xx.\r\n\r\nFootnote 556:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. viii., February 1906, p. 356, and vol.\r\n  ix., July 1906, p. 278.\r\n\r\nThere remains one other miniature to be noted, which until recently was\r\nregarded as the work of Hans Mielich, but is now, with apparent justice,\r\ngiven to Holbein. It is in the Bavarian National Museum, Munich, and\r\nrepresents a young man, turned slightly to the right, with a fair\r\npointed beard and moustache, and wearing a black dress and cap. It is\r\ninscribed upon the blue background, on either side of the sitter’s head,\r\n“H.M. ÆTATIS SVÆ 27.”[557] It was once thought to be a portrait of\r\nMelanchthon, and afterwards, on account of the initials it bears, it was\r\nregarded as a portrait of Mielich by himself. Its attribution to Holbein\r\nwas due to Dr. Hans Buchheit, the director of the National Museum, who\r\npublished it in 1911 as a work of the painter’s later time. The initials\r\nupon it are undoubtedly those of the sitter, and not of the artist, and\r\nit has been suggested that it represents the painter, Harry Maynert, one\r\nof the witnesses to Holbein’s will.[558] Whether this is so or not, the\r\nminiature itself is a fine one, and, judging from a photograph alone,\r\nits attribution to Holbein by Dr. Buchheit must be accepted as the\r\ncorrect one.\r\n\r\nFootnote 557:\r\n\r\n  _British Miniature Painters_, 1898, p. 14 and Pl. v.\r\n\r\nFootnote 558:\r\n\r\n  Pierpont Morgan Catalogue, No. 3, and Pl. iii., No. 1, and colour\r\n  plate, _édition de luxe_, No. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n                 THE WINDSOR DRAWINGS AND OTHER STUDIES\r\n\r\nThe history of the book of drawings by Holbein in the royal\r\n  collection at Windsor Castle—Early references to it—Sir John\r\n  Cheke—The book’s various changes of ownership—Charles I exchanges\r\n  it with the Earl of Pembroke for a Raphael—Afterwards in the\r\n  Arundel Collection—Discovery of the drawings in Kensington Palace\r\n  by Queen Charlotte—John Chamberlaine’s publication of them from\r\n  engravings by Bartolozzi—Methods of their execution—Their present\r\n  condition—Description of the more important of them—And of similar\r\n  portrait-drawings at Berlin and Basel—Holbein and the Clouets—The\r\n  “Queen of Sheba” miniature painting at Windsor—The “Death of\r\n  Virginia” at Dresden—Drawing of a ship at Frankfurt—Drawings of\r\n  animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIF, through some great misfortune, nothing remained of Holbein’s work\r\nbut the wonderful series of drawings of the heads of the men and women\r\nof Henry VIII’s court, in the royal library at Windsor, this collection\r\nalone would still afford irresistible proof of his right to the title of\r\none of the very greatest masters of portraiture. The history of these\r\ndrawings can be traced with some exactness, though there are certain\r\nbreaks in the continuity of the story. In whatever way they may have\r\nbeen preserved by Holbein during his lifetime, they were, shortly after\r\nhis death, bound together in book form, and so remained until their\r\nrediscovery in the eighteenth century. Although they are not included in\r\nthe elaborate inventory of the royal collection of works of art, dated\r\n24th April 1542, or in the second inventory taken five years later, in\r\nthe first year of Edward VI’s reign, it may be conjectured that they\r\ncame into the possession of the Crown on Holbein’s death in 1543, or\r\nvery shortly afterwards. His death was so sudden, that they may have\r\nbeen left behind in his painting-room at Whitehall, unknown to his\r\nexecutors, and so remained in royal keeping, though this is not a very\r\nlikely surmise. It is certain, in any case, that the book containing\r\nthem was at one time in the possession of Edward VI. This is proved by\r\nan entry in the Lumley inventory of 1590, to which reference has been\r\nalready made more than once. The entry is as follows: “A greate booke of\r\nPictures doone by Haunce Holbyn of certeyne Lordes, Ladyes, gentlemen\r\nand gentlewomen in King Henry the 8: his tyme, their names subscribed by\r\nS^r John Cheke Secretary to King Edward the 6 w^{ch} book was King\r\nEdward the 6.”\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt the statement that the names on many of the\r\ndrawings were supplied by Sir John Cheke, who, at one time professor of\r\nGreek at Cambridge, became one of the tutors of the young Prince before\r\nhe ascended the throne, and died in 1557. He must thus have been\r\nintimately acquainted with a certain number of Holbein’s sitters, though\r\nnot with all of them. This would account for the fact that although many\r\nof the names he has written on the drawings are the right ones, certain\r\nothers are incorrect, while some fourteen of them are not named at all.\r\nHe made mistakes, for instance, over some of the earlier drawings, such\r\nas several of the sitters in the More Family Group, with whom he was not\r\nlikely to have been acquainted, and in some doubtful cases he probably\r\nindulged in guesswork. The late Sir Richard Holmes considered that he\r\nmerely made a list of the drawings, which has not survived, and that\r\nfrom this list the names were inscribed on the sheets by some later\r\nhand.[559] There is an entry in the accounts of Sir Thomas Carwarden,\r\nMaster of the Revels, preserved among the Loseley MSS., which very\r\nprobably refers to this very book of drawings. The document is undated,\r\nbut is considered to be of the reign of Edward VI. It is as follows:\r\n“Item for a peynted booke of Mr. Hanse Holby making, 6 _li._” It is, of\r\ncourse, quite possible that this “peynted booke” may have had nothing to\r\ndo with the Windsor drawings, but there is no other known work of\r\nHolbein’s to which the description would so well apply. The supposition\r\nthat it was the very book, and that it was purchased by Sir Thomas for\r\nEdward VI, fits in well with the fact, established by the Lumley\r\ninventory, that the youthful monarch at one time possessed it. If this\r\nbe so, the suggestion that Henry VIII obtained it immediately after\r\nHolbein’s death is, of course, incorrect.\r\n\r\nFootnote 559:\r\n\r\n  Holmes in Introduction to Hanfstaengl’s _Portraits of Illustrious\r\n  Personages of the Court of Henry VIII._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF DRAWINGS]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the book came into the possession of Henry\r\nFitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, after the death of Edward VI, either by gift\r\nor purchase, and was preserved at Nonsuch, together with the various\r\nportraits by Holbein, already mentioned, some of which were certainly at\r\none time in the royal possession; and on his death in 1580, passed to\r\nhis son-in-law, Lord Lumley. The palace and estate of Nonsuch reverted\r\nto the Crown in 1591, by exchange for other property, but at what time\r\nthe numerous pictures by Holbein left the possession of the Lumley\r\nfamily is not known. At Lord Lumley’s death in 1609 the greater number\r\nof his books passed into the hands of Henry, Prince of Wales, elder\r\nbrother of Charles I, and it is very probable that the “greate booke of\r\nPictures doone by Haunce Holbyn” accompanied them, and once again formed\r\npart of the royal collections.[560] It is usually stated, however, that\r\nCharles I obtained them through the good offices of M. de Liancourt, the\r\nFrench ambassador, this statement being based on a note in Abraham Van\r\nder Doort’s catalogue of that monarch’s pictures, which, if correct,\r\nindicates that at some time between the drawing up of the Lumley\r\ninventory (1590) and the list of King Charles’ pictures (1639), the book\r\nof drawings had been taken into France, and so cannot have belonged to\r\nHenry, Prince of Wales. It seems certain, nevertheless, that this\r\nsupposed journey to France and back again never took place. Mr. Lionel\r\nCust’s suggestion is evidently correct, and the mistake has arisen\r\nthrough a confusion between Holbein’s book of drawings and a very\r\nsimilar book of drawings by a French hand, representing illustrious\r\npersonages of the French court, both of which were in the King’s\r\ncollection, and are separately described in Van der Doort’s catalogue.\r\nIt was the latter book, no doubt, which was procured through M. de\r\nLiancourt, some such volume as that now at Knowsley, or the collection\r\nformerly at Castle Howard, now at Chantilly,[561] or the numerous albums\r\nof a similar kind scattered about France. Holbein’s book of drawings, on\r\nthe other hand, came to Charles I from his brother.\r\n\r\nFootnote 560:\r\n\r\n  See Cust, _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xviii., February 1911, p. 269.\r\n\r\nFootnote 561:\r\n\r\n  These were purchased by the fifth Earl of Carlisle in Flanders,\r\n  probably towards the close of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe King, however, did not retain the volume for long, but exchanged it\r\nwith the Earl of Pembroke for the beautiful little picture of “St.\r\nGeorge slaying the Dragon,” by Raphael, which is now in the Hermitage\r\nGallery, St. Petersburg. This latter is entered in Van der Doort’s\r\ncatalogue as “A little St. George, which the King had in exchange of My\r\nLord Chamberlain, Earl of Pembroke, for the book of Holbein’s drawings.”\r\nThis picture was sold by the Commonwealth for £150, and after passing\r\nthrough the La Noue, De Sourdis, and Crozat collections, found a final\r\nresting-place in the Hermitage. In 1627, while still in the Earl of\r\nPembroke’s possession, it was engraved by Lucas Vorsterman, so that the\r\nexchange with the King may have taken place in 1628 or thereabouts. Lord\r\nPembroke, in his turn, did not keep the drawings, but almost at once\r\npassed them on to the great collector, Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel,\r\nwho, according to Sir Edward Walker, who wrote his life, had “more of\r\nthat exquisite master, Hans Holbein, than are in the world besides.”\r\nWhether Lord Pembroke gave the drawings to him, or in his turn carried\r\nout a second exchange, is not known.\r\n\r\nTheir presence in the Arundel Collection is proved by a contemporary\r\nreference in the manuscript among the Harleian MSS.[562] in the British\r\nMuseum entitled, “An exact & Compendious Discours concerning the Art of\r\nMiniatura or Limning,” on the fly-leaf of which is written, in an\r\neighteenth-century hand, “of Limning by Hilliard,” to which attention\r\nhas been already called.[563] As the Holbein drawings were still in the\r\npossession of Charles I in 1627, the paragraph in the “discours” which\r\nspeaks of them as in the Arundel Collection cannot have been penned by\r\nNicholas Hilliard himself, who died in 1619. The compiler was almost\r\ncertainly Edward Norgate, who held Holbein in the highest estimation.\r\nSpeaking of the painting of shadows, he says:—\r\n\r\nFootnote 562:\r\n\r\n  No. 6000.\r\n\r\nFootnote 563:\r\n\r\n  See p. 219.\r\n\r\n    “The black must be deepened with ivory black, and if in working\r\n    in the heightenings and light-reflections, you will mingle with\r\n    your ordinary black a little lake and indigo, or rather a little\r\n    litmus instead of indigo, you will find your black to render a\r\n    rare and admirable reflection like to that of the well-dyed\r\n    satin, especially if your lights be strong and hard; the manner\r\n    whereof if you please to see inimitably expressed, you will find\r\n    abundantly for your content in the gallery of my most noble Lord\r\n    the Earl of Arundell, Earl Marshal of England, and done by the\r\n    incomparable pencil of that rare master, Hans Holbein, who in\r\n    all his different and various manners of painting, either in\r\n    oil, distemper, limning, or crayon, it seems was so general and\r\n    absolute an artist, as never to imitate any man, or ever was\r\n    worthily imitated by any.”[564]\r\n\r\nFootnote 564:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Wornum, pp. 397-8. Also by Dallaway with slight differences\r\n  (see p. 219 above).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NORGATE’S REFERENCES]\r\n\r\nThe reference to the Windsor drawings occurs in the chapter dealing with\r\ncrayon-painting. “I shall not need,” the writer says, “to insist upon\r\nthe particulars of this manner of working; it shall suffice, if you\r\nplease, to view of a book of pictures by the life, by the incomparable\r\nHans Holbein, servant to King Henry the Eighth. They are the pictures of\r\nmost of the English lords and ladies then living, and were the patterns\r\nwhereby that excellent painter made his pictures in oil by; they are all\r\ndone in this latter manner of crayons I speak of, and though many of\r\nthem be miserably spoiled by the injury of time, and the ignorance of\r\nsome who formerly have had the keeping of the book, yet you will find in\r\nthose ruinous remains an admirable hand, and a rare manner of working in\r\nfew lines and no labour in expressing of the life and likeness, many\r\ntimes equal to his own, and ever excelling other men’s oil pictures. The\r\nbook hath been long a wanderer; but is now happily fallen into the hands\r\nof my noble lord the Earl Marshal.”[565]\r\n\r\nFootnote 565:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Wornum, p. 398. Dallaway, in his notes to Walpole, vol. i.\r\n  p. 84, quotes this passage with slight differences, and adds after\r\n  “Earl Marshal”—“a most eminent patron to all painters who understood\r\n  the arte; and who therefore preserved this book with his life, till\r\n  both were lost together”—which is not consistent with the words\r\n  preceding it.\r\n\r\nA second contemporary reference to the drawings occurs in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary manuscript, _Miniatura or the Art of Limning, etc._, also by\r\nEdward Norgate, to which reference has been already made.[566] Norgate,\r\nwhen dealing with crayon drawings, says: “A better way was used by\r\nHolbein, by priming a large paper with a carnation or complexion of\r\nflesh-colour, whereby he made pictures by the life, of many great lords\r\nand ladies of his time, with black and red chalke, with other flesh\r\ncolours, made up hard and dry, like small pencil sticks. Of this kind\r\nwas an excellent booke, while it remained in the hands of the most noble\r\nEarl of Arundel and Surrey. But I heare it has been a great traveller,\r\nand wherever now, he hath got his errata, or (which is as good) hath met\r\nwith an index expurgatorius, and is made worse with mending.”[567] That\r\nthe book was described as a “great traveller” is, no doubt, due to the\r\nfact that from 1642 until his death, four years later, the Earl was\r\nliving on the Continent, and that he took all his works of art with him.\r\n“After her husband’s death,” says Mr. Cust,[568] “the Countess of\r\nArundel continued to reside at various places on the Continent,\r\naccompanied by her collections, until her own death at Amsterdam in\r\n1654. Litigation then ensued between her sons as to the disposal of her\r\nproperty. A good part of the valuable Arundel Collection was disposed of\r\nin Holland by the Countess’s younger son, Lord Stafford, but a\r\nconsiderable part eventually returned to the family of the Duke of\r\nNorfolk in England.” There is every reason to suppose that among the\r\nlatter the Holbein book was included.\r\n\r\nFootnote 566:\r\n\r\n  See p. 219. This manuscript is Norgate’s final version of the\r\n  “discours,” written some twenty years or so later than the British\r\n  Museum manuscript, which was his first compilation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 567:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Dallaway, in his notes to Walpole’s _Anecdotes_, vol. i. p.\r\n  84; and by Wornum, p. 398.\r\n\r\nFootnote 568:\r\n\r\n  See Cust, _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xviii., February 1911, p. 269.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LATER HISTORY OF THE DRAWINGS]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that, according to Charles I’s catalogue, the number\r\nof drawings was only fifty-four. Van der Doort may have made a mistake\r\nin the entry, putting a 5 instead of an 8, otherwise it must be supposed\r\nthat Lord Arundel already possessed some thirty of these “heads,” which\r\nhe added to the book after Lord Pembroke had given it to him. The\r\ncollection as it now exists does not contain the whole of the\r\nportrait-drawings of Holbein’s English period. The fine head of Lord\r\nAbergavenny at Wilton appears to have been kept back, or to have been\r\naccidentally retained, by Lord Pembroke when he parted with the\r\nremainder of the collection, and there are several others in continental\r\nmuseums and elsewhere, some of which are known to have once formed part\r\nof the Arundel Collection. At Basel there are Sir Nicholas Carew, an\r\nunknown English lady, and a second English lady and her husband; at\r\nDresden the Count Moretta; at Munich the head of Henry VIII; at Berlin a\r\nfine head of an unknown Englishman; in the Salting Collection the\r\nmagnificent study of a lady already described;[569] and the two heads in\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire’s Collection at Chatsworth.[570] If, therefore,\r\nVan der Doort is correct in stating that there were only fifty-four\r\ndrawings in the book when it was in his keeping, the one person in\r\nEngland most likely to have added so considerably to their number was\r\nthe Earl of Arundel, who was unceasing in his search for original works\r\nfrom Holbein’s hand. There is no record to show at what time the book\r\nreturned to the royal collections, though the tradition noted by\r\nDallaway, in his edition of Walpole’s _Anecdotes_, that they were\r\npurchased for James II at the sale of the possessions of Henry, Duke of\r\nNorfolk, in 1686, is no doubt the correct one.[571] A list of the\r\ndrawings was included in James II’s catalogue, which was published by\r\nBathoe in 1758. After this the drawings themselves were laid aside and\r\nforgotten, and it was not until early in the reign of George II that\r\nthey were rediscovered by Queen Caroline hidden away in a folio in an\r\nold bureau in Kensington Palace, together with a volume of equal\r\nimportance containing the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci, which now form\r\nso valuable a part of the royal collection at Windsor. Queen Caroline\r\nhad them framed and glazed, and for many years they decorated her own\r\napartments, first at Richmond, and afterwards in Kensington Palace.\r\nEarly in the succeeding reign they were removed to the Queen’s House,\r\nnow Buckingham Palace, where they were taken from the frames and bound\r\nup in two volumes, forming a part of the large collection of drawings,\r\nsimilarly bound, got together by George III. The suggestion that they\r\nshould be engraved originated with Dalton, the keeper of the King’s\r\ndrawings, but the work was so badly done that it was abandoned in 1774\r\nafter ten plates only had been issued. The engraver was George Vertue,\r\nwho, according to Walpole, was the originator of the project. “It is a\r\ngreat pity,” he says, “that they have not been engraved; not only that\r\nsuch frail performances of so great a genius might be preserved, but\r\nthat the resemblances of so many illustrious persons, nowhere else\r\nexisting, might be saved from destruction. Vertue had undertaken this\r\nnoble work; and after spending part of three years on it, broke off, I\r\ndo not know why, after having traced off, on oil paper, but about five\r\nand thirty. These I bought at his sale; and they are so exactly taken as\r\nto be little inferior to the originals.”[572] This tracing was done by\r\nVertue and Müntz when the drawings were hanging in Queen Caroline’s room\r\nat Kensington. There were thirty-four of them, and they were framed and\r\nhung in what Walpole called his Holbein Chamber at Strawberry Hill.\r\nSomewhat later the projected publication was taken up again more\r\nsuccessfully, on the suggestion, according to Dallaway, of Horace\r\nWalpole, under the direction of John Chamberlaine, who succeeded Dalton\r\nas keeper of the drawings. The engravings were published between 1792\r\nand 1800 in fourteen numbers, containing eighty-two portraits, forming\r\ntwo large folio volumes, under the title of _Imitations of Original\r\nDrawings by Hans Holbein, in the Collection of His Majesty, for the\r\nPortraits of Illustrious Persons of the Court of Henry VIII, with\r\nBiographical Tracts_. The historical notices were written by Edmund\r\nLodge, Lancaster Herald, and the plates, with the exception of eight,\r\nwere engraved by F. Bartolozzi, R.A. F. C. Lewis was also engaged to\r\ntake part in the work, but his plate of “Cecilia Heron” was in all ways\r\nso much finer than Bartolozzi’s efforts that Chamberlaine had the plate\r\ndestroyed, fearing that if it were published side by side with the\r\nothers, the latter would suffer so severely from the contrast that the\r\nsuccess of the publication would be endangered. As transcripts of\r\nHolbein’s drawings, Bartolozzi’s engravings have very little artistic\r\nmerit. Many of them, indeed, have small likeness to the originals, and\r\nall of them lack the strength and character and the searching truth of\r\nline which make the drawings themselves such masterpieces of art. In\r\nmore recent years the drawings have been frequently photographed and\r\npublished, the most important series being that issued by Mr. F.\r\nHanfstaengl in two volumes, with an introduction and descriptive notes\r\nby the late Sir Richard Holmes, F.S.A. It should be added that under\r\nQueen Victoria the two volumes were broken up, and the drawings properly\r\nmounted and arranged. They are now kept in four portfolios.\r\n\r\nFootnote 569:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. p. 309.\r\n\r\nFootnote 570:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. pp. 336-7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 571:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, vol. i. p. 84 _note_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 572:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, pp. 85-86.\r\n\r\nIn Walpole’s day the collection consisted of eighty-nine sketches, but\r\nin more recent times two have been withdrawn, as the work of Jacob\r\nBinck. One of the two heads of Sir Thomas Wyat is only a good, careful\r\ncopy of the other, in which the hair of the beard is drawn with great\r\nelaboration, from the hand of some follower or imitator of Holbein, and\r\nin one or two other cases the drawings are, perhaps, only copies of lost\r\noriginals, or even original drawings by some other hand, such as the\r\nso-called “Melanchthon,” with its faltering line, which lacks much of\r\nHolbein’s customary strength and certitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE METHOD OF THEIR EXECUTION]\r\n\r\nThe drawings were executed in almost all cases in black and coloured\r\nchalks. During his first visit to England Holbein used, as a rule, white\r\npaper, the outlines being drawn in black and the features modelled in\r\nred chalk. The series of heads of members of Sir Thomas More’s family,\r\nand contemporary drawings such as the Warham and Guldeford, are done in\r\nthis manner. Later on it was his custom to use a paper covered entirely\r\nwith a ground of flesh or salmon colour, upon which the features were\r\nmodelled in black chalk, and slight touches of red, after which the\r\noutlines were strengthened and the details of the hair, dress, and\r\nornaments put in with pen or brush and Indian-ink. In some cases the\r\nwhole face was completely modelled with the greatest delicacy, and as a\r\nrule the eyes, hair, and beard were drawn in with water-colour or\r\ncoloured crayons in their natural hues. Upon a number of the drawings\r\nthe colour and material of the costume worn by the sitter are indicated\r\nby notes in Holbein’s own handwriting, and in some of them details of\r\nthe ornaments or embroideries have been drawn on the margin of the sheet\r\nwith the brush with the sure and rapid hand of a master. In one\r\ninstance—the portrait of John Godsalve—the drawing is entirely finished\r\nin water-colours, and the figure is shown against a blue background; and\r\nin one of the two heads of Sir Thomas More the holes with which it was\r\npricked for tracing on the panel can still be seen. The earlier drawings\r\nare usually the largest, the one last-named being about 16 in. high by\r\n12 in. wide. The Warham is 17 in. by 12 in., the Guldeford 15 in. by 11\r\nin., and the Godsalve the same size. One of the largest of all is the\r\nJane Seymour, which is 20½ in. by 11 in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE METHOD OF THEIR EXECUTION]\r\n\r\n“Some have been rubbed,” says Walpole, “and others traced over with a\r\npen on the outlines by some unskilful hand.”[573] In a few instances, it\r\nis true, these strengthening touches appear to be by some other hand\r\nthan Holbein’s, but in most of the drawings they are just as certainly\r\nhis. The studies have suffered considerable damage during the passage of\r\ntime. They are stained, and many of them badly rubbed, so that the more\r\ndelicate modelling and colouring carried out in crayons has almost\r\nvanished. In consequence the brush-work, which has better withstood\r\nrough usage, at first sight appears to be a little hard, and in some\r\ninstances even coarse, thus slightly marring that perfect harmony of\r\neffect which characterised the drawings when fresh from the artist’s\r\nhand. The finer details have been worn away, leaving certain lines more\r\nprominent than Holbein intended. A closer study, however, as Sir Richard\r\nHolmes points out, shows that it is to the wonderful strength and\r\ndelicacy combined of these touches that the portraits owe the vivid and\r\nlife-like quality which they so pre-eminently possess. “On some of the\r\nheads these touches occur only on the eyes, nostrils, and lips, where\r\nthe marvellous accuracy of modelling, particularly in the corners of the\r\nmouth, is not to be excelled in the work of any other master.”[574] It\r\nmust be remembered, too, that these studies were, in almost all cases,\r\nworking drawings, done for transference or for copying on the panel, and\r\nare in that sense not finished works, some parts and details being\r\nemphasised more strongly than others. In certain of the drawings the\r\nbeard and the hair have been put in with the brush with that careful and\r\nelaborate detail with which such features were usually carried out by\r\nHolbein in his finished portraits; for instance, in the long beard of\r\nSir Thomas Wyat or the close-cut hair of Simon George. In other drawings\r\nthe unshaven stubble on a man’s chin or upper lip is put in with a few\r\nmasterly strokes. Here and there high lights have been indicated with a\r\ntouch of white, as in the heads of Lord and Lady Vaux. It may be taken,\r\nthen, that in the greater number of cases, the only hand which can be\r\ntraced in these drawings is that of Holbein himself, dimmed here and\r\nthere by the passing of the years, or rough or careless usage at some\r\ntime or other during their earlier wanderings. Certain critics, however,\r\nconsider that in many of them, some later hand has attempted to revivify\r\nthe fading lines, with results quite contrary to those intended. Mr.\r\nCampbell Dodgson, speaking of the lovely head of an Englishwoman in the\r\nSalting Collection, describes it as being “entirely free from the\r\nretouching which disfigures many of the Windsor heads.”[575] Mr. Gerald\r\nDavies is also among those who consider that the drawings have been\r\nretouched by some other hand than Holbein’s. “I am quite persuaded,” he\r\nsays, “that the strengthening of the outlines, either by chalk lines or\r\nin many cases by Indian-ink, is not due to the hand of Holbein himself.\r\nAmong the drawings are a few which have never been so touched. The lines\r\nof these are of great delicacy and of the most expressive quality—an\r\nartistic dream which has almost faded from the paper. These are the\r\nselect few which, having suffered most from rubbing, and having the\r\nfaintest indications to guide the hand of the reinforcer, have been left\r\nin their ghostly beauty. Others have been revived by the application of\r\na bolder chalk line of the proper colour in parts where the outline\r\nseemed most to need it. It has been done on the whole well, if such a\r\nthing can ever be said to have been well done at all. But these same\r\nlines will be found to be hard and wiry, and somewhat unfeeling as\r\ncompared to the subtly sympathetic outline of the master himself. There\r\nremains yet the further manner of reinforcement by a strong outlining,\r\noften accompanied by a slight thickening in parts by means of a wash, in\r\nwhat appears to be Indian-ink. The ink has toned now, and has lost much\r\nof the offence of its once strong contrast with the rest of the delicate\r\nmodelling. But remembering what that contrast would have been when the\r\nink was fresh, I find it impossible to believe that it was added by the\r\nhand of Holbein.”[576] Mr. Davies suggests that this Indian-ink\r\nstrengthening took place when the drawings came into the hands of\r\nCharles I, and that possibly Wenceslaus Hollar was employed for the\r\npurpose. It is difficult to follow him in this suggestion of Hollar’s\r\nretouching, nor can the writer agree with him in his opinion that a more\r\nor less wholesale retouching of the drawings has ever been undertaken by\r\nany hand than that of Holbein himself. A more credible suggestion is\r\nthat of Mr. Lionel Cust, who says: “It is very probable that the\r\ndrawings were refreshed by outlines very soon after Holbein’s death, if\r\nnot by the painter himself. Since that date the most likely time for\r\nthem to have suffered any alteration would have been after their\r\nrediscovery at Kensington, when they were for a time in the hands of\r\nGeorge Vertue, an expert crayon-artist himself as well as\r\nengraver.”[577]\r\n\r\nFootnote 573:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed.

It is possible, too, though far from probable,\r\nthat he may have had one or two pupils—though here again there is no\r\nrecord of them—who would copy his drawings, and might be entrusted\r\noccasionally with the tracing of the drawings upon the panel, or even in\r\npainting parts of the replicas of portraits which must sometimes have\r\nbeen ordered. It is evident that these drawings were made solely for the\r\nartist’s own purposes, both in order to avoid a too frequent attendance\r\nof his sitters at his studio, and also because it was the method of\r\nworking which best suited him. They remained, therefore, in his own\r\npossession, and were never handed over to his patrons. The fashion of\r\ncollecting portraits of celebrities which was in vogue in France\r\nthroughout the sixteenth century was only imitated in a very minor\r\ndegree in England. In France, as M. Dimier points out, “the result of\r\nthis rage for portraits was that people were not content with the\r\nnecessarily limited number of originals. The works of the masters of the\r\ntime were copied and recopied a hundred times, often by unskilful and\r\nsometimes by absolutely clumsy hands. This was the case not only with\r\nthe portraits of kings and queens, which have been multiplied thus in\r\nall ages, but with those of any one at court—a feature which is peculiar\r\nto the period under consideration. Not even the number of painted\r\nportraits and painted copies was enough; there was a demand for quicker\r\nand cheaper satisfaction. The original chalk-drawings were copied, in\r\nthe same medium, an infinite number of times, far oftener, indeed, than\r\nthe paintings; and these drawings were commonly bound into albums and\r\npreserved as family treasures. A vast number of these albums must have\r\nperished, but a vast number still exist.”[578] Nothing of this kind\r\noccurred on this side of the Channel. Holbein’s original drawings, after\r\nhis death, were preserved in a volume in this fashion, but they formed\r\nan unique example. Though copies or duplicates of one or two of them\r\nexist, such as the John Fisher and the Duchess of Suffolk in the British\r\nMuseum, the Guldeford, Fisher and Poyntz formerly in the Heseltine\r\nCollection, and the head called Sir Charles Wingfield in the collection\r\nof Sir John Leslie, Bart., recently published by Mr. Lionel Cust,[579]\r\nthe collection as a whole was never copied in this way, as it would have\r\nbeen in France. It is doubtful if most of these duplicates, fine as they\r\nare, are actually from Holbein’s own hand.\r\n\r\nFootnote 578:\r\n\r\n  Dimier, _French Painting in the Sixteenth Century_, p. 29.\r\n\r\nFootnote 579:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xviii., February 1911, p. 271.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STUDIES FOR LOST PORTRAITS]\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted that portraits were painted from nearly all\r\nthese Windsor studies, more than eighty in number, though possibly a\r\nfew, drawn during the last months of his life, were not carried out in\r\nthis way. It is, therefore, a little extraordinary that less than thirty\r\nof such finished oil portraits have so far been traced, the remainder\r\nhaving disappeared; and of these latter only about one half are original\r\npaintings by Holbein, the remainder being copies of lost originals.\r\nAmong the first-named we have Jane Seymour, Catherine Howard, the Prince\r\nof Wales, Sir Thomas More, Warham, Guldeford, Southwell, John Godsalve,\r\nReskimer, Simon George, Lady Vaux, Lady Rich, Lady Butts, Lady Audley\r\n(miniature only), and one or two others; in the second class the More\r\nFamily Group is the most important, there being no less than seven\r\nstudies for this great work at Windsor, including the one of Sir Thomas\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThere still remain more than fifty drawings in England alone of which no\r\npaintings are known. It seems impossible that the whole of these\r\npictures should have perished. Some of them, it is to be hoped, may yet\r\nbe discovered, hidden away in some remote country house, perhaps\r\nobscured by dirt and disfigured by repaintings, so that hitherto they\r\nhave remained unrecognised. It is not very likely that drawings of this\r\nsize were made as preliminary studies for miniatures, or otherwise this\r\nmight account for some of the missing portraits, as such small works\r\nwould be much more easily lost than panel paintings. It is true that in\r\na few instances, such as the portraits of Lady Audley and the Earl of\r\nAbergavenny, we have miniatures closely following the drawings, but no\r\nlarge portraits; but it does not follow that the latter were not\r\npainted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a considerable number of Holbein’s\r\nportraits—between thirty and forty—for which no preliminary studies\r\nremain, and these range over every period of his career. This, however,\r\nis not so extraordinary, for drawings disappear more easily than\r\npictures. In some instances, too, their absence may be explained by the\r\nartist’s method of work. It was his occasional habit, more particularly\r\nin the earlier half of his career, to fasten down the preliminary study\r\nupon the panel, and use it as the ground-work of his painting, so that\r\nthe drawing naturally was lost. The portrait of his wife and children at\r\nBasel has been carried out in this way, and the Anne of Cleves in the\r\nLouvre is painted on vellum or parchment, afterwards mounted on canvas.\r\nThis, however, was not his more regular practice, which was to transfer\r\nthe study to the panel by tracing or pricking. Not a single study exists\r\nfor any one of the portraits of the German merchants of the Steelyard,\r\nor for such portraits as the Duchess of Milan, Jean de Dinteville and\r\nthe Bishop of Lavaur, Kratzer, Thomas Godsalve, Sir Henry Wyat,\r\nCromwell, Tuke, the Duke of Norfolk, Cheseman, Dr. Chamber, and the\r\npainted portraits of various unknown men at Berlin, Vienna, Basel, and\r\nelsewhere. For the portraits of Erasmus there is only a study for the\r\nhands, while there is no drawing for the Amerbach or Froben. On the\r\nother hand, among a number of fine drawings in continental museums there\r\nare, in addition to the two earlier and three later ones of the members\r\nof the Meyer family, only two—the Morette in Dresden and the Sir\r\nNicholas Carew in Basel—of which the finished paintings still exist.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Holbein’s practice as a portrait painter during\r\nhis second and longer residence in England was almost entirely confined\r\nto the court and to those who were in the King’s employment. The Windsor\r\ndrawings, a number of which have been described in previous chapters of\r\nthis book, make this sufficiently clear. Included among the heads which\r\nhave not been described are John Russell, Earl of Bedford; Sir William\r\nParr, afterwards Marquis of Northampton; Thomas Boleyn, Earl of\r\nWiltshire and Ormonde; Edward Stanley, Earl of Derby; George Brooke,\r\nLord Cobham; Thomas, Lord Vaux; Sir Thomas Parry; Sir William\r\nSherrington; Sir Thomas Wentworth; Edward, Lord Clinton; Sir Thomas le\r\nStrange; Sir George Carew; Lord Chancellor Rich, and others; and among\r\nthe ladies, Lady Parker, Lady Ratcliffe, Mary Zouch, Lady Rich, Lady\r\nHenegham, the Marchioness of Dorset, Lady Mewtas, Lady Monteagle, and\r\nLady Borough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL.

The head, with\r\nclose-cropped hair and short, round beard, has suffered from rubbing,\r\nbut remains a fine and strongly individualised study of character. The\r\ndress and jewellery are indicated with some elaboration, to which are\r\nadded notes in Holbein’s handwriting, and detailed sketches of his hat\r\nornaments and other jewellery are drawn in the margin. The medallion he\r\nwears appears to be of open-work with a figure of St. George, and one of\r\nthe links of his chain is inscribed with the word “MORS.” In the Thomas\r\nBoleyn,[581] also, the right hand is shown, and the dress is drawn with\r\nmuch more detail than in most of the companion drawings, while the face\r\nis one of the most carefully elaborated in the whole series, the\r\nindividual hairs of the beard and moustache being indicated with minute\r\nprecision. Equally careful drawing of the hair is to be seen in the head\r\nof Lord Stanley,[582] with its expressive face and fine eyes. Another\r\nvery powerful drawing is the full-face portrait of Lord Cobham,[583]\r\nwith open doublet showing his bare chest, a head of most striking\r\nindividuality. One of the most beautiful among the more finished studies\r\nis that of Lord Vaux (Pl. 35),[584] in which the hair, cut straight\r\nacross the forehead, and the beard and moustache are put in with almost\r\nmicroscopic detail, as well as the design upon the white collar with its\r\nstrings of black and white cord. There is a second study of Lord\r\nVaux[585] in the collection. It is, of course, impossible to give even a\r\nshort description of the whole of the drawings, but among the numerous\r\nstudies of “unknown men” two in particular cannot be overlooked. The one\r\nis the head of a handsome young man with a long, sharp nose,[586] thin\r\nwhiskers, and a small beard, the head turned slightly to the right, and\r\nboth eyes shown (Pl. 34 (1)). He wears large ostrich feathers in his\r\nblack hat, which has a medallion, the design not indicated, and gold\r\ntags. The dress, very roughly sketched in, is badly rubbed. The drawing\r\nis one of great beauty, very delicate and refined in its treatment and\r\nfeeling. The second, to which reference has been already made, is the\r\nvery striking likeness of a man with a flat, broad nose, bushy, curly\r\nbeard, and hair falling over the ears, his eyes cast slightly downwards,\r\none of the most powerful drawings in the Windsor Collection, which Miss\r\nHervey suggests is possibly a study for a second portrait of Jean de\r\nDinteville (Pl. 36# (1)).[587] Dr. Paul Ganz considers the sitter to be\r\na man of pronounced southern French type, and probably a member of the\r\nFrench embassy which was in London in 1533.[588] It is just as probable,\r\nhowever, that this unknown nobleman was English, for the type, though\r\nunusual, is to be met with occasionally.\r\n\r\nFootnote 580:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 316; Wornum, ii. 5; Holmes, i. 15.\r\n\r\nFootnote 581:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 288; Wornum, i. 21; Holmes, i. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 582:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 310; Wornum, i. 16; Holmes, i. 18.\r\n\r\nFootnote 583:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 315; Wornum, i. 44; Holmes, i. 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 584:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 320; Wornum, i. 26; Holmes, i. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 585:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 322; Wornum, i. 41; Holmes, i. 31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 586:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 346; Wornum, i. 25; Holmes, i. 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 587:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 345; Wornum, i. 12; Holmes, i. 52.

II., PLATE 38\r\n  “THE LADY HENEGHAM”\r\n  (Possibly Margaret Roper)\r\n  _Drawing in black and coloured chalks_\r\n  WINDSOR CASTLE\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong the portraits of ladies it is unfortunate that several of the\r\nfinest have suffered from bad rubbing. Such an one is the head of Mary,\r\ndaughter of the Duke of Norfolk, and wife of the King’s natural son,\r\nHenry, Duke of Richmond, which has been already described.[589] The fine\r\nhead of Lady Mewtas (Pl. 37# (2)),[590] the face a strong one, is very\r\ndelicately modelled, and unspoilt by the presence of too forcible\r\noutlines. Her jewelled ornaments include a circular pendant with five\r\ndark table stones and three hanging pearls, suspended from a thin chain,\r\nwith beads round the neck, a circular medallion at the breast with a\r\nfigure subject now almost obliterated, and across the top of the bodice\r\na band of pearls set in groups of five like flowers. The\r\nincorrectly-named “Lady Mary, after Queen,”[591] whom it certainly does\r\nnot represent, is another fine drawing which has suffered considerable\r\ndamage. It has been gone over with the tracing point for transference to\r\npanel, but no painting after it is now known to exist. The same is the\r\ncase with the head of the Marchioness of Dorset,[592] the daughter of\r\nCharles Brandon and the King’s sister, Mary, which also shows\r\nindications of tracing. This is a good example of a drawing in which the\r\nfine modelling of the face has now almost disappeared, so that the\r\ndarker lines stand out too insistently. There is most brilliant and\r\nsubtle drawing of the eyes, nose, and mouth in the very expressive and\r\nbeautiful head of the so-called Lady Henegham (Pl. 38),[593] wife of Sir\r\nAnthony Hemingham or Heveningham, of Ketteringham in Norfolk, which\r\nremains in very excellent condition. She wears a small pendant ornament\r\nwith one hanging pearl at her neck, and on the breast an upright oval\r\nmedallion with a figure within a Renaissance framework. It has been\r\nsuggested that this fine head really represents Margaret Roper, and the\r\nfeatures are not unlike those of several members of the More family; but\r\nagainst this attribution must be placed the fact that the drawing,\r\nunlike all the other studies for the family picture, is not on white\r\npaper. Among the best of the other heads of women are Lady Parker,[594]\r\nLady Lister,[595] Lady Rich,[596] Lady Elyot,[597] Lady Audley, already\r\ndescribed (Pl. 37 (1)), an unknown lady, wearing a white cap or bonnet\r\ncovering the hair and ears and reaching to the chin[598]—a large drawing\r\non white paper, something of the type of the More family, but rather\r\nmore freely drawn—and Mary Zouch (Pl. 36 (2)).[599] The last-named is\r\none of the most attractive of the whole series. The face, seen in full,\r\nis modelled with extreme delicacy and expression. She wears a French\r\ncircular hood with bands of ornament over her smooth, yellow hair,\r\nparted in the middle and covering the ears. Her dress is of black\r\nvelvet, as noted in Holbein’s handwriting, and the medallion at her\r\nbreast, surrounded with a Renaissance framework, has an almost\r\nobliterated subject, apparently a female figure with flying draperies\r\nseated on a rock, possibly Perseus and Andromeda. This drawing is\r\ninscribed “M. Souch,” and Sir Richard Holmes, following Wornum, suggests\r\nthat the drawing represents Joan, wife of Richard Zouch, son of Lord\r\nZouch of Haringworth. It is, however, more probably Mary Zouch, a member\r\nof the same family, who was a maid of honour to Jane Seymour, and, after\r\nthe Queen’s death, received an annuity of £10 on April 6th, 1542, in\r\nrecognition of her services, which was to be continued until she “was\r\nmarried or otherwise provided for.”[600]\r\n\r\nFootnote 589:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 324; Wornum, ii. 17; Holmes, ii. 23.

(April 6, 1542.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STUDIES IN BERLIN AND BASEL]\r\n\r\nThe Berlin Print Room possesses a remarkably fine portrait-drawing of an\r\nunknown Englishman,[601] with deep blue eyes, straight brown hair, a\r\nscanty beard, and a thoughtful, expressive face, slightly turned to the\r\nleft. He wears a small flat cap, unornamented, and the usual gown with\r\nheavy fur collar. Only slight touches of colour have been used on the\r\neyes, hair, and lips, and the paper has been covered with a pale red\r\nwash.\r\n\r\nFootnote 601:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 120. Reproduced by Ganz, _Hdz. von H. H. dem Jüng._, Pl. 36;\r\n  Davies, p. 224.\r\n\r\nAmong the portrait-drawings in the Basel Gallery, some fourteen in all,\r\nmost of which have been already described, the finest is perhaps that of\r\nan unknown young man in a large, broad-brimmed black hat,[602] which is\r\ncertainly one of the most beautiful of his drawings now existing (Pl.\r\n39). The sitter, a handsome and dignified man, with a large, straight\r\nnose, and refined features—evidently a man of culture of the type of\r\nBonifacius Amerbach—is turned to the left, the face seen almost in\r\nprofile, though both eyes are shown. The lips of the mobile mouth are\r\nslightly parted, and the expressive eyes gaze into the distance, as\r\nthough he were lost in thought. The brown, bushy hair, which covers the\r\nears and falls over the forehead, is drawn with rapid, masterly touches,\r\nand the profile of the face stands out with great effect against the\r\ndark background formed by the underside of his large hat. The flesh\r\ntints are suggested with simple but subtle touches of the chalk. The\r\ndress is merely sketched in with a few lines, though the brown fur\r\ncollar of his coat is sufficiently indicated just where it comes under\r\nthe beardless chin. This superb drawing, in which the artist has seized\r\nupon and set down with unerring insight the finest traits of the\r\nsitter’s character, is in black and coloured chalks. The type of face,\r\nin the opinion of Woltmann and Dr. Ganz, is distinctly German. From its\r\ntechnique, which, on the one hand, has much in common with the later\r\nstudies of the Meyer family made for the Darmstadt “Madonna,” and on the\r\nother with the drawings for the More Family Group, it may be surmised\r\nthat this study was made in Basel shortly before Holbein left for his\r\nfirst visit to England. It has much in common, too, with the coloured\r\ndrawing in Basel of Holbein himself, and it may be noted, as a small\r\npoint, that the hat the unknown youth is wearing is similar to the one\r\nthe artist wears, though rather larger, and is of a different fashion\r\nfrom the black head-gear worn by Holbein’s English sitters.\r\n\r\nFootnote 602:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 38.

It has been conjectured that it represents Lady Carew, and\r\nalso Lady Guldeford. The equally beautiful drawing of Sir Nicholas\r\nCarew[605] has been described already. All the drawings just mentioned\r\nform part of the Amerbach Collection, and it may be suggested, though\r\nthe suggestion is not a very plausible one, that at least those of them\r\nwhich represent English people were taken to Basel by Holbein himself,\r\non one or other of his visits home, and were left behind when he\r\nreturned to England, together with the sketch-book, also in the Amerbach\r\nCollection, which is undoubtedly of the English period; or, on the other\r\nhand, they may have been sent over from London to his widow with his\r\npersonal belongings by his executors after his death.\r\n\r\nFootnote 603:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 36, 37.

II., PLATE 39\r\n  PORTRAIT OF AN UNKNOWN YOUNG MAN\r\n  _Drawing in black and coloured chalks_\r\n  BASEL GALLERY\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN AND THE CLOUETS]\r\n\r\nAltogether apart from their artistic merits, these drawings of Holbein’s\r\nare of the utmost historical value, both on account of their number,\r\nincluding as they do so many of the leading characters who played a part\r\nin the making of England in Tudor days, and also because of the\r\nperfection of their draughtsmanship and the corresponding life-likeness\r\nof their portraiture, so that they form true documents in every sense of\r\nthe word. Holbein’s genius shows us Henry’s ministers and the lords and\r\nladies who surrounded him, just as they were in life, without any\r\nattempt at flattery, but with every feature set down with unfaltering\r\ntruth, and, above all, with a grasp of character which the portrait\r\ndrawings of no other great master of his period show in the same degree.\r\nHe has left behind, as a mine of wealth for the use of the student of\r\nhistory, in drawings alone, without taking into account his numerous\r\npainted portraits for which no drawings now exist, a series of more than\r\none hundred representations of Tudor men and women. In only one other\r\ninstance can we turn to a similar series of contemporary portraits—the\r\nchalk drawings of French men and women of the same century by the two\r\nClouets, Jean and François, father and son. These, though of the utmost\r\nvalue as historical portraiture, and also of great beauty and even\r\nfascination as works of art, fall short of the greatness which stamps\r\nHolbein’s work of a like nature. The elder Clouet had not his mastery of\r\ndrawing; his knowledge was more limited and his means more restricted.\r\nHis drawings have “a stiffness and dryness which are very far from the\r\nflowing and supple handling of the Basle master.”[606] His son had\r\nconsiderably more science. “His drawing in reality is extremely\r\nprofound, and as exactly calculated as any known. In tracing the human\r\nface and all the parts presented by the model, he has the ability of a\r\nspecialist, whose long practice of an art that is deep rather than wide\r\nhas enabled him to accumulate a mass of information and experience. He\r\nreaches perfection in the proportion of the features, in the exact\r\nplacing of all the fine fugitive, mobile parts of the face, in the\r\ncareful study of the extremely subtle relations from which the mass of\r\nform draws its solidity, and in skill in constructing the unity of\r\nimpression of a face and of a type.”[607] He has little or nothing,\r\nhowever, of Holbein’s beauty of style. Holbein’s drawings are matchless\r\nin the delicacy of their modelling, every little depression or\r\nprominence in the contours of the face being indicated with an\r\nexactitude and a simplicity of means unrivalled in work of such nature;\r\nand also for the way in which this delicacy of touch in handling the\r\ncrayon, and subtlety and precision of the strengthening lines with brush\r\nor pencil, are combined with the wonderful vigour and sense of life with\r\nwhich each individual drawing is filled. Added to their truthfulness in\r\nportraiture there is that remarkable insight into the true nature and\r\nfeelings of the sitter which is one of the greatest qualities of\r\nHolbein’s art. It is owing to the knowledge and mastery which are the\r\nbasis of these Portrait-Studies—studies usually made with rapidity, but\r\nin which nothing essential has been missed by the penetrating eye and\r\nunerring hand of the artist—that so perfect a result is obtained with\r\nmeans apparently so slight. Delicacy and strength meet in them in\r\nexquisite combination; the flexibility and refinement of his line are\r\nalways kept well under control, and there is no over-elaboration of\r\ndetail to the detriment of character. Each drawing bears upon it the\r\nstamp of a style, and of a great style, which was Holbein’s own\r\nindividual possession, in which freedom and truth are tempered and\r\nperfected by self-restraint.\r\n\r\nFootnote 606:\r\n\r\n  Dimier, _French Painting in the Sixteenth Century_, p. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 607:\r\n\r\n  Dimier, p. 205.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL.

Chief\r\namong them is the small drawing on parchment, highly finished like a\r\nminiature, in the Library, Windsor Castle, which represents the “Queen\r\nof Sheba’s visit to King Solomon” (Pl. 40).[608] It is a composition\r\ncontaining no less than thirty-four small figures, and so, after the\r\nwall-paintings in the Basel Town Hall and the “Triumphs” of the London\r\nSteelyard, is one of the most considerable arrangements of grouping ever\r\nattempted by him. King Solomon is seated on a throne on a high daïs\r\napproached by a number of steps within a large chamber, the roof of\r\nwhich is supported by slender columns of Renaissance architecture.\r\nBehind the throne is suspended a large curtain, and on the steps on\r\neither side are placed groups of the elders and long-bearded wise men of\r\nSolomon’s kingdom. In the centre the Queen mounts the steps, her hands\r\noutstretched as though in wonder and admiration of the great king. In\r\nthe foreground a procession of her ten ladies, walking two and two,\r\npasses towards the left, and on the right are a group of her attendants\r\nbearing rich presents, some of them kneeling with uplifted baskets. The\r\ndrawing is in silver-point, slightly washed with grey and brown, and\r\ntouched here and there with water-colour; the fruits in one of the\r\nbaskets are red and green, and some of the draperies and details are\r\ntouched with dead gold. The background between the pillars is blue\r\npowdered with gold stars. The Renaissance architecture of the setting is\r\npurer and less florid in style than is the case with many of Holbein’s\r\nearlier studies for glass paintings. The figures of the women are\r\ngracefully conceived and grouped, and the heads of the men have\r\ncharacter and expression. In its general arrangement the upper half of\r\nthis miniature drawing recalls the “Rehoboam” wall-painting in the Basel\r\nTown Hall, though the setting is more richly treated; while in the\r\ngeneral gracefulness of its design it is Italian in feeling, and has\r\nclose affinity to the “Triumph of Riches” drawing for the decoration of\r\nthe Steelyard. It was probably done at about the same date as the\r\nlatter, perhaps as a present for the King, the subject having been\r\nchosen as conveying a subtle and flattering suggestion that Henry and\r\nSolomon were alike in their possession of great wisdom. It is finished\r\nwith such minute care that it does not seem likely that it is merely the\r\npreparatory sketch for some larger picture or wall-painting. There is no\r\nrecord of any wall-decoration of this subject, either in the Steelyard\r\nor at Whitehall, though Holbein may have had some idea when at work upon\r\nit that it might serve for such a purpose afterwards if it met with the\r\nKing’s approval; or, on the other hand, it may be a miniature copy from\r\none of his frescoes in grisaille, which has disappeared, made by Holbein\r\nhimself as a gift for his royal master. It was at one time in the\r\nArundel Collection, and while there was engraved by Hollar. In the\r\ninventory of that collection it is entered as “Regina de Saba in\r\nminiatura chiaroscuro.” There is a picture in the Dresden Gallery\r\nrepresenting the “Death of Virginia,” which appears to be an early copy\r\nof another of Holbein’s lost frescoes in grisaille, which has many\r\npoints in common with the “Queen of Sheba” miniature painting, and is\r\ncarried out in a similar scheme of colouring. Both were, no doubt, the\r\nwork of his second English residence.[609]\r\n\r\nFootnote 608:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 272. Reproduced in Ganz, _Hdz. von H.

Others play\r\ndrum and trumpets, some hold pikes, and one of them embraces a girl. The\r\nanchor has been hauled up, and most of the sailors are at work in the\r\nrigging unfurling the sails; but several of them are taking parting\r\ndrinks from large jars, even at the masthead, and one of the number is\r\nalready overcome with sea-sickness. Below, on the left, a boat with two\r\nrowers is pulling vigorously towards the ship, either to put on board a\r\nlate comer or to fetch off those for the shore. The exact date of this\r\ndrawing is uncertain. It is possible that Holbein saw some such vessel\r\nduring his visit to Amerbach in the south of France, or that he made it\r\na year or two later at Antwerp on his way to England for the first time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 610:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 152.

His great\r\ntechnical powers in every department of decorative design, his practical\r\nknowledge of the various processes employed in the different branches of\r\nart workmanship for which he supplied the craftsmen with patterns and\r\nworking drawings, show him to have been a real master of arts in every\r\nsense of the word.\r\n\r\nFootnote 612:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. p. 255.\r\n\r\n“The artistic quality he possessed in the highest degree,” says Mr. M.\r\nDigby Wyatt, “was, I consider, the intensity with which he realised\r\n‘form.’ Able master as he was of delineation, what gives the stamp of\r\nenduring truth to his work is the feeling of assurance his delineation\r\nconveys to the mind of the spectator, that what he has drawn from life\r\nwas the _vera effigies_ of what he saw—that what he designed could never\r\nbe executed with equal propriety in any other way than as his drawing\r\ndefined it. There is never any uncertainty as to his intention or\r\nmeaning—what he says was, was—what he says should be, should be. In this\r\nprecise conception of pure form and power of conveying his own sense of\r\nit to others, he stood upon the same platform as the great men to whose\r\nuniversal genius I have already alluded—Albert Dürer and Leonardo da\r\nVinci. The artist who possesses in a high degree any such power as that\r\nI have attempted to define, must of necessity have the requisite\r\naptitude for success in either painting, architecture, or sculpture, or\r\nall three; since the power in question lies at the root of and is\r\nindispensable to the satisfactory practice of either or all. Architects\r\nwill do well to look earnestly at such reliques as time has spared of\r\nthe genius of Dürer, Da Vinci, and especially of Hans Holbein, since, so\r\nfar as I know, they were the best makers of working drawings who ever\r\nlived. Of whatever they drew they gave every characteristic, and their\r\nslightest sketches never fail to mark essentials and to omit secondaries\r\nof form and expression.”[613]\r\n\r\nFootnote 613:\r\n\r\n  M. Digby Wyatt, “Foreign Artists employed in England,” &c.,\r\n  _Transactions of the Royal Institute of British Architects_, 1868, p.\r\n  229.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, speaking of the rise of Renaissance architecture in\r\nEngland—“Grecian art plaistered on Gothic,” he calls it—says that “the\r\nbeginning of reformation in building seems owing to Holbein. His porch\r\nat Wilton, though purer than the works of his successors, is of this\r\nbastard sort; but the ornaments and proportions are graceful and well\r\nchosen. I have seen drawings of his, too, in the same kind. Where he\r\nacquired this taste is difficult to say; probably it was adopted from\r\nhis acquaintance with his fellow-labourers at court.”[614] Though\r\nthere is no doubt that Holbein would have been a fine architect had\r\nhis inclination led him to practise that branch of art—the backgrounds\r\nof his designs for painted glass afford ample proof of his aptitude\r\nfor design in the new architectural manner of the Italian\r\nRenaissance—Walpole’s assertion cannot be accepted as the truth. Henry\r\nVIII had at least two good Italian architects in his employment—first,\r\nGirolamo da Treviso, and afterwards John of Padua, as well as\r\nsculptors and modellers of architectural detail such as Benedetto da\r\nRovezzano and Giovanni da Maiano, and it is the influence of such\r\nItalians as these that is to be most clearly discerned in the\r\nbuildings which were erected in England at this period. Holbein\r\nproduced a few designs of an architectural nature, but no building\r\nexists of which it can be said that he was the architect.\r\n\r\nFootnote 614:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, i. 128.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “HOLBEIN’S GATE” AT WHITEHALL]\r\n\r\nThe gateway which, according to tradition, he designed, and hence known\r\nas “Holbein’s Gate,” was one of Henry VIII’s additions to Whitehall, and\r\nconnected the tennis court, the cock-pit, and the bowling-green with the\r\npalace, besides providing the King with a gallery into the park, from\r\nwhich he could witness the sports which took place there on special\r\noccasions. It was built, according to Walcott, of stone mixed with small\r\nsquares of flint, and tesselated, and was “very neatly set.” J. T.\r\nSmith, in his _Antiquities of Westminster_, describes it as being in the\r\nTudor style of architecture, with battlements and four lofty towers, the\r\nwhole enriched with _bustos_ on the north and south sides. Pennant, who\r\nhad himself seen the gate, says: “To Holbein was owing the most\r\nbeautiful gate at Whitehall, built with bricks of two colours, glazed\r\nand disposed in a tesselated fashion. The top, as well as an elegant\r\ntower on each side, were embattled. On each front were four busts, in\r\nbaked clay, which resisted to the last every attack of the weather.” An\r\nexcellent idea of its appearance is to be obtained from the engraving by\r\nG. Vertue (1725) in the “Vetusta Monumenta.”\r\n\r\nThe gateway was pulled down in 1759 in order to widen Parliament Street.\r\nThe materials were obtained by the Duke of Cumberland, Ranger of Windsor\r\nPark, with the intention of re-erecting the gate at the end of the Long\r\nWalk. In the end, however, they were worked up in several buildings the\r\nDuke built in the park. Two of the medallions were put in front of the\r\npark lodges, but most of them appear to have been stolen when the\r\ngateway was pulled down. Three of them eventually came into the\r\npossession of a coachbuilder named Wright, who, in 1769, employed John\r\nFlaxman, the sculptor, then a boy, to repair them. They were in\r\nterra-cotta, coloured and gilt, and the ornaments included the rose and\r\ncrown and the King’s initials. Wright had them removed to Hatfield\r\nPriory, Essex, where they were still to be seen in 1803, in which year\r\nJ. T. Smith went down there to copy them. They were larger than life,\r\nand were said to be representations of Henry VII, Henry VIII when\r\nsixteen, and Bishop Fisher. The two which decorated the front of the\r\npark lodges were afterwards removed to Hampton Court, where, says Allan\r\nCunningham, “they are made to do duty as two of the Roman emperors\r\ndescribed by Hentzner in his _Travels_.” It seems probable that they\r\nwere the work of Giovanni da Maiano. In its design there is nothing to\r\nsuggest that Holbein was the architect of this famous gateway, and it is\r\nmuch more probable that one of the Italians employed by the King was\r\nresponsible for it; and the legend which connects Holbein with it may\r\nhave arisen from the fact that he had rooms in Whitehall, possibly in\r\nthe very gateway to which his name has been so long attached. It\r\ncontained, says Dallaway, “several apartments, but the most remarkable\r\nwas the ‘little study, called the New Library,’ in which Holbein was\r\naccustomed to employ himself in his art, and the courtiers to sit for\r\ntheir portraits.”[615]\r\n\r\nFootnote 615:\r\n\r\n  Dallaway, notes to Walpole’s _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, p. 133.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PORCH AT WILTON]\r\n\r\nTradition has also long associated the name of Holbein with the Porch at\r\nWilton, the seat of the Earl of Pembroke. This porch or loggia is of no\r\ngreat beauty, but it is free from any admixture of Gothic detail, and is\r\na good example of the early adaptation in England of Renaissance\r\narchitecture and ornamentation. It originally formed part of the house,\r\nbut in the nineteenth century, when some alterations to the buildings\r\nwere made, it was removed to the end of a walk in the gardens. The\r\ndissolution of the monastery of St. Edith, on the site of which the\r\nhouse stands, took place in 1539, and the abbey and its rich possessions\r\nwere granted by the King to Sir William Herbert shortly afterwards. In\r\nthe erection of his mansion the first Earl no doubt employed one of the\r\narchitects then attached to Henry’s court, for there is little in the\r\ndesign of this small porch to support the tradition that the man he\r\nselected was Holbein, rather than one of the Italians whose business it\r\nwas to invent and embellish such buildings. It is, indeed, simpler in\r\ndesign and less lavish in ornamental detail than those architectural\r\nbackgrounds to his windows which Holbein produced when in Basel, based\r\nupon recollections of his visit to Italy. The size of the porch may be\r\ngauged by the entrance-way, which measures 8 feet in height. Round the\r\nthree outer doorways runs an interlaced design cut in low relief, which\r\nstill retains much of its original colour, the ground a rich red and the\r\nornament yellow, from which the original gilding has worn away. In the\r\ncorners a wreath of fruit and flowers encircles a small wyvern on a blue\r\nbackground. Above the capitals of the fluted pillars, and just below the\r\nprojecting mouldings that divide the upper and lower portions of the\r\nporch, is a broad band filled with a pattern of intersecting circles,\r\npainted on a flat surface in light blue and yellow, lined and touched\r\nwith darker blue and red. Probably the whole surface was originally\r\npainted and gilded. In the upper part the double pillars are repeated,\r\nbut with rich acanthus capitals. On the three faces over the openings\r\nare panels with the Pembroke coat of arms, with a circular medallion on\r\neach side, containing heads of men and women in relief, those on the\r\nfront being apparently busts of the Earl and his wife. The vigorous\r\nheraldic design supported by the Talbot dogs and wyverns forms a novel\r\nfinish to the crown. The interior has a ribbed and vaulted ceiling, and\r\nbrackets and other details in bold relief, including a number of figures\r\non pedestals. It is, of course, possible that Holbein provided drawings\r\nfor the building of this porch, but there is no real evidence of this,\r\nand the style of the design does not suggest his invention. It is much\r\nmore likely to have been due to one of Henry’s Italians, such as Antonio\r\nToto. “The character of the whole,” says Woltmann, “as is shown\r\nespecially in the crowning, is far too feeble for us to think of Holbein\r\nas its architect; and, besides this, the costume of the half-length\r\nfigures, introduced in several of the medallions, shows that the work\r\nwas executed near the close of the sixteenth century.”[616] Wornum also\r\ncalls attention to the lateness of the costumes, and says of the porch\r\nitself that it displays “neither taste nor knowledge of the style.” He\r\nadds: “As for the Whitehall Gate, it was a mongrel of Gothic and\r\nRenaissance quite unworthy of Holbein, and, I should imagine, an\r\nimpossible design for him; it was similar in general character to the\r\ngate of St. James’s Palace, at the bottom of St. James’s Street.”[617]\r\nWaagen says that the medallions contain busts of Edward VI and the\r\nPembroke family.[618]\r\n\r\nFootnote 616:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, Eng. trans., p. 419.\r\n\r\nFootnote 617:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, pp. 359-60.\r\n\r\nFootnote 618:\r\n\r\n  For drawings of this porch and its various details, and a description\r\n  of it as it now is, see an article in the _Art Journal_, 1897, pp.\r\n  45-8, written and illustrated by Mr. G. Fidler.\r\n\r\nAmong the architectural works by Holbein, which, if they were ever\r\ncarried out, cannot now be traced, must be placed his very admirable\r\ndesign in the British Museum for a magnificent chimney-piece[619] for\r\none of Henry VIII’s palaces, in all probability Bridewell. It is\r\nconceived in the finest Renaissance taste, and is covered with elaborate\r\nand beautiful ornamentation. It is in two stages, each flanked by a pair\r\nof fluted pillars carrying richly-decorated entablatures. The upper part\r\nis divided into six divisions, the three higher ones containing the\r\nroyal arms and motto, and the king’s initials and badges, the portcullis\r\nand fleur-de-lis. The central panel of the lower range represents a\r\nbattle of horsemen, and the two on either side contain circular\r\nmedallions with figures of Charity and Justice, charming compositions,\r\nin which beauty of form is rendered with all that freedom and life-like\r\naccuracy which characterise everything Holbein produced, even his most\r\nhasty sketches. The lower part of the fireplace, over the open hearth,\r\non which the logs are shown burning across two fire-dogs, is filled with\r\na semicircular lunette, with a second scene of horsemen engaged in\r\nfurious combat, in the centre of which is a wreathed medallion with\r\nfigures of Esther and Ahasuerus. In the spandrels are smaller rounds\r\nwith the heads of a lady and a helmeted warrior. On the bases of the\r\npillars on either side are blank tablets for inscriptions, surrounded by\r\nscroll-work. This splendid fireplace was evidently intended to occupy an\r\nimportant position in one of the King’s buildings, as the frequent\r\noccurrence of his initials and the presence of the royal coat of arms\r\nand badges indicate. Peacham, in his _Compleat Gentleman_, when speaking\r\nof Holbein, says that he has seen “of his owne draught with a penne, a\r\nmost curious chimney-peece K. _Henry_ had bespoke for his new built\r\npallace at _Bridewell_,” and there is no doubt that this is the drawing\r\nto which he referred. It is in pen and ink, with Indian-ink wash and\r\nslight colour, 21¼ in. × 16¾ in., and was formerly in the Arundel,[620]\r\nRichardson, and Walpole collections. It is possible that Holbein made\r\nsimilar designs for Nonsuch Palace. In this drawing Mr. Digby Wyatt\r\nthought he saw the same designer as the one who produced the beautiful\r\nwoodwork of King’s College Chapel, Cambridge. This important work, he\r\nsays, “I cannot hesitate to believe must have been executed from his\r\ndesigns.... In its way it is a model of Renaissance wood-carving,\r\nrevealing in every arabesque, and especially in the ornaments of the\r\nlunettes, the peculiarities of classical form as they were first, if I\r\nmay use the expression, _translated_ from the Italian into German by\r\nAlbert Dürer, Altdorfer, Peter Vischer, and others, including\r\nHolbein.”[621] The ceiling of the chapel of St. James’s Palace has also\r\nbeen attributed to Holbein, though without any evidence but that of\r\nstyle. This ceiling, says Wornum, “is a curious work, a panelled\r\nRenaissance design, and tastefully coloured. It was repaired in 1836 by\r\nSir R. Smirke; the general ground is blue; the panellings are defined by\r\nribs of wood gilt; there are also ornaments in foliage, painted green;\r\nand there are many coats of arms emblazoned in their proper colours. A\r\nsmall running open ornament, cast in lead, enriches the under sides of\r\nthe ribs. The date 1540 occurs in several places, and various short\r\ninscriptions are scattered about, as—Henricus Rex 8—H and A, for Henry\r\nand Anne of Cleves, with a lover’s knot between them.”[622] His work in\r\nconnection with the internal decoration of Whitehall, including the\r\ngreat fresco in the Privy Chamber and the ceiling in the Matted Gallery,\r\nmentioned by Pepys, has been already described.[623]\r\n\r\nFootnote 619:\r\n\r\n  British Museum Catalogue, 16 (vol. i. p. 330).

M. Nichols in his paper, to which reference has been already made,\r\nread before the Society of Antiquaries in March 1898, must be noted. In\r\nthe design of the two capitals[624] supporting the arch which divides\r\nthe chancel of old Chelsea Church from the More Chapel he “recognised at\r\nonce the characteristic invention of Holbein.” Each capital is “founded\r\nupon the suggestion of a classical capital of the composite order. But\r\nthe antique model is treated with a freedom which would scarcely have\r\ncommended itself to the taste of an Italian artist.” They are capitals\r\nof half columns, there being only a single arch between the chapel and\r\nthe chancel, and each capital, like the pillars, has five sides, as the\r\ncolumns, if completed, would be octagonal. In the eastern capital the\r\nvolutes terminate in a projecting human head, and in each hollow of the\r\nabacus above is inserted the winged head of a cherub. The acanthus-leaf\r\ndesign which covers the lower part has various objects introduced among\r\nthe foliage, such as a shield with More’s arms and his crest of a Moor’s\r\nhead, a sword crossed with a sceptre, a mace, and two ornamented\r\ntablets, one of which bears the date 1528 in Arabic numerals. The\r\nwestern capital is of a somewhat similar design. Human heads take the\r\nplace of those of the cherubs, and the five sides below display various\r\nreligious emblems and ornaments, such as crossed candlesticks, a bundle\r\nof tapers, a pail of holy water with sprinkling-brush, a clasped\r\nprayer-book or missal, and a blank shield. These objects clearly have\r\nreference to the religious ceremonies in which More was accustomed to\r\ntake part in the chapel, while the ornaments on the other capital may\r\nhave reference to his secular employments. The Holbeinesque character of\r\nthe designs, combined with the locality of Chelsea, the association with\r\nSir Thomas, and the date 1528, during the earlier part of which year\r\nHolbein was still in England, are sufficient, in Mr. Nichols’ opinion,\r\nto prove that Holbein was the designer. Mr. Beaver, in his _Memorials of\r\nChelsea_, in discussing the authorship of these capitals, rejects their\r\nattribution to Holbein on the ground that they have an Italian\r\ncharacter, and may be more probably ascribed to one of the Italian\r\nartists then employed in this country; and most architects who have made\r\na close study of this period are in agreement with him. “But,” says Mr.\r\nNichols, “there are abundant examples in Holbein’s work of his fondness\r\nfor architectural details of a Renaissance type.... An Italian architect\r\nwould scarcely have dealt so freely with the just proportions of the\r\nclassic capital upon which his design was founded. And I am inclined to\r\nthink that there was only one artist in England at that time who\r\ncombined the fertility of invention and the graceful mastery of detail\r\nshown in these capitals with the boldness and freedom with which the\r\nclassic model is treated.”[625] Mr. Reginald Blomfield is of opinion\r\nthat these carvings are of French origin. He says: “The names of French\r\nartists or workmen scarcely ever occur in the State Papers, and there\r\nare few instances of Renaissance work in England which can be attributed\r\nto them. The capitals to the arch between the More chantry and the\r\nchancel of old Chelsea Church are an unusual instance. They closely\r\nresemble French work of the early sixteenth century such as is found\r\nalong the banks of the Seine between Paris and Rouen. The monument in\r\nthe Oxenbrigge Chapel in Brede Church, Sussex, dated 1537, is another\r\nrare example. It is of Caen stone, admirably carved, and was probably\r\nmade in France and shipped to the port of Rye, some nine miles distant\r\nfrom Brede.”[626]\r\n\r\nFootnote 624:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced from photographs in Mr. Nichols’ paper, _Proceedings Soc.\r\n  of Antiq._, second series, vol. xvii.

In a\r\n  letter to the present writer, in 1901, Mr. Blomfield, after his\r\n  attention had been called to Mr. Nichols’ paper, states that he\r\n  adheres to his opinion that the Chelsea capitals are of French origin.\r\n\r\nIn the same paper Mr. Nichols also draws attention to a two-light\r\nstained-glass window in the south chapel of the village church of\r\nShelton in Norfolk, which contains figures of Sir John Shelton and his\r\nwife, Ann, daughter of Sir William Boleyn and aunt to Henry VIII’s\r\nsecond queen, a lady well known about the court, who at one time had\r\ncharge of the Princesses Mary and Elizabeth. The work, in Mr. Nichols’\r\nopinion, is evidently of foreign origin, being totally different from\r\nthe English glass of the same period within a few feet of it, and the\r\nfaces and figures being executed more in the manner of a picture than of\r\nstained glass. The foreign origin of the work is shown, among other\r\nindications, by the peculiar treatment of the heraldry, which has a\r\ndecidedly German character. Both figures are represented kneeling, Sir\r\nJohn in a crimson robe lined with fur, and his dame in a contemporary\r\ndress of crimson, with the English angular head-dress. The heads appear\r\nto have been carefully drawn from good portrait-studies supplied to the\r\nglazier. Calculating from the known age and date of Sir John Shelton’s\r\ndeath and his appearance in the window, Mr. Nichols holds that these\r\nportrait-studies must have been made about 1527, and he is of opinion\r\nthat Holbein’s was the hand which supplied some foreign glazier with the\r\ndesigns for them. Neither of the heads, however, is to be found among\r\nthe Windsor series.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN’S DESIGNS FOR JEWELLERS]\r\n\r\nIt is when we turn to Holbein’s work for jewellers and silversmiths that\r\nthe extraordinary fertility and happiness of his invention and the\r\nbeauty of his design are seen to the greatest advantage. Some hundreds\r\nof his working drawings in this branch of art still exist, the greater\r\nnumber of which are in the British Museum and at Basel, those in the\r\nlatter collection being for the most part contained in a sketch-book of\r\nhis later English period; indeed, most of the drawings which have\r\nsurvived were produced in England, though he must have carried out a\r\nconsiderable body of work of the same nature while in Basel. When he\r\ncame to London he was already a master of decorative design as applied\r\nto most of the handicrafts, and his influence soon made itself felt\r\namong a number of the craftsmen employed by Henry and his court. His\r\nwonderful skill in the production of fine Renaissance ornamentation of\r\nthe purest taste, combined with a happy use of the human figure, set a\r\nfashion in jewellery and personal ornament, and inspired those who\r\ncarried out his designs to a greater beauty and delicacy of workmanship.\r\nThe impetus he gave was in the direction of fresh models of beautiful\r\nform in place of the mannerisms of Gothic art into which the decorative\r\ncrafts had sunk in this country at the period of his first arrival in\r\nEngland. Even at so early an age he already possessed, in addition to\r\nhis skill in painting and drawing and book illustration, a thorough\r\nknowledge of the rules of composition and design according to the best\r\nItalian traditions, and was well versed in the use of the forms and\r\nproportions of classical architecture and ornament, in addition to\r\npossessing practical skill in the true application of design to the\r\nvarious art crafts and industries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 41\r\n  QUEEN JANE SEYMOUR’S CUP\r\n  _Pen-and-ink drawing_\r\n  BRITISH MUSEUM\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESIGNS FOR CUPS AND GOBLETS]\r\n\r\nHolbein’s most elaborate design for goldsmiths’ work which has survived\r\nis the one known as the Jane Seymour Cup, which was evidently made to\r\nthe order of the King at about the time of his marriage with that lady\r\nin 1536. Two drawings for this exist in pen and ink, the more\r\nhighly-finished one, which is washed with colour and gold, being in the\r\nBodleian Library, Oxford,[627] and the other in the British Museum,[628]\r\nthe latter (Pl. 41), which is 17¾ in. × 9½ in., showing slight\r\nmodifications. The cup is a covered one, of a very beautiful shape, the\r\nlines of which are not disguised or confused by the lavish ornamentation\r\nwith which it is covered. The body is set with four circular medallions\r\ncontaining busts of “antique heads” in high relief, the one facing the\r\nspectator being a woman with bared breast. Above them is a deep band of\r\nexceptionally beautiful interlacing ornament of floriated design; and\r\nbelow a smaller band with the initials of Henry and his Queen, entwined\r\nwith true-lovers’ knots, alternating with square-cut precious stones set\r\nas flowers, and similar bands of precious stones at the base, and round\r\nthe rim of the cover. The stem is decorated with hanging pearls and\r\ndolphins, cupids’ heads, and wreaths, and a narrow band containing the\r\nmotto of the Queen, “Bound to Obey and Serve,” which is repeated on the\r\ncover. The latter is of very light and graceful design, with two\r\ngrotesque figures terminating in fish-tails blowing foliated trumpets,\r\nand above them two cupids supporting a shield surmounted by the royal\r\ncrown. When carried out in gold the general effect must have been one of\r\nextraordinary richness and beauty. That it was so completed is proved by\r\nthe fact that the cup itself was still in the royal collection at the\r\naccession of Charles I in 1625. In an inventory of that date it is thus\r\ndescribed: “Item a faire standing Cupp of Goulde, garnished about the\r\ncover with eleaven Dyamonds, and two poynted Dyamonds about the Cupp,\r\nseaventeene Table Dyamonds and one Pearle Pendent uppon the Cupp, with\r\ntheis words BOVND TO OBEY AND SERVE, and H and I knitt together; in the\r\nTopp of the Cover the Queenes Armes, an Queene Janes Armes houlden by\r\ntwoe Boyes under a Crowne Imperiall, weighing Threescore and five ounces\r\nand a halfe.” No further traces of this masterpiece of the goldsmith’s\r\nart exist. In spite of its beauty, it was most probably melted down,\r\nlike much of the royal plate, to meet the demands of an impoverished\r\nexchequer. It is, indeed, a matter of the keenest regret that, in spite\r\nof the hundreds of designs with which Holbein furnished the London\r\ngoldsmiths or the Basel armourers, not a single example of work so\r\ncarried out remains, and his achievements in this branch of art can only\r\nbe judged from his working drawings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 627:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 222.

II., PLATE 42\r\n  HANS OF ANTWERP’S CUP\r\n  _Pen and wash drawing_\r\n  BASEL GALLERY\r\n]\r\n\r\nHis designs for cups with covers, goblets, tankards, and other table\r\nvessels, which from the richness of their ornament were evidently\r\nintended for ceremonious occasions, are numerous. Some of them are only\r\nknown through Hollar’s etchings, while the drawings for the remainder\r\nare for the most part in the Basel Gallery. The most interesting of them\r\nis the standing cup and cover in the Basel sketch-book, which Holbein\r\ndesigned for his friend Hans von Antwerp (Pl. 42),[629] which may have\r\nbeen intended by the latter as an addition to the collection of plate in\r\nthe guild-hall of the Steelyard merchants. The left-hand half has been\r\ndrawn with the pen, from which the other half has been transferred by\r\ndamping and pressure. The broad, flat body has a deep band of ornament\r\ncontaining nude figures blowing trumpets amid foliage, and a somewhat\r\nsimilar band round the base, and on the crest of the cover is the nude\r\nfigure of Truth holding a book and a lighted torch. By the side is an\r\nalternative design for this figure. Round the rim of the cover is\r\ninscribed HANS VON ANT[WERPEN]. Another cup and cover, or table\r\nornament, with a wide stand, of which only the left side is shown,\r\nthough much more hasty in execution, is a more highly elaborated piece\r\nof decoration, in which small nude standing figures are combined with\r\nleafage and festoons.[630] On the side of the sheet are a number of\r\nalternative sketches for various details. There is no need to describe\r\nat length the other designs for covered cups in the Basel Gallery, one\r\nof which is surmounted by the nude figure of a woman with right arm\r\nextended and the left hand resting on a shield;[631] while a second\r\ndesign has a figure of Justice, and on the base a medallion with the\r\nbust of a lady in sixteenth-century costume.[632] Several studies for\r\ntankards are to be found among Hollar’s etchings. These etchings\r\nindicate the existence at one time of a third sketch-book or set of\r\ndesigns, which, at the time when Hollar worked from it, was in the\r\npossession of the Earl of Arundel, but has since disappeared.\r\n\r\nFootnote 629:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 110 (104).

II., PLATE 43\r\n  SIR ANTHONY DENNY’S CLOCK\r\n  _Indian ink wash and pen drawing_\r\n  BRITISH MUSEUM\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of Holbein’s designs in the British Museum is\r\nthe large drawing in pen and ink and Indian-ink wash, of an astronomical\r\nclock, which was formerly in the Mariette and Horace Walpole collections\r\n(Pl. 43).[633] This clock, the design for which must have been one of\r\nHolbein’s last undertakings, was presented to Henry VIII by Sir Anthony\r\nDenny on New Year’s Day, 1544, shortly after the painter’s death. It\r\nconsists of an hour-glass enclosed within a case, the doors of which\r\nstand open in the drawing, with a terminal figure of a satyr in the\r\ncentre, which recalls the very similar figure in the full-length woodcut\r\nportrait of Erasmus. The hour-glass rests on a pedestal with legs,\r\nsupported at the corners with other terminal figures of satyrs, and\r\nhaving a circular space in the centre left blank in the drawing. On the\r\ndecorated crown of the case stand two nude boys—for which there is an\r\nalternative design in the British Museum on one of the leaves of the\r\nSloane sketch-book[634]—each pointing to a sundial of metal curved\r\noutwards in an arc, for which their fingers serve as gnomon. On their\r\nheads rests a mechanical clock with a sun-face in the centre of the dial\r\nwith fiery locks, one of which forms the pointer, the whole surmounted\r\nby a crown. On the left side of the sheet is a compass, probably\r\nintended to fit inside the clock-case. The drawing is inscribed, in Sir\r\nAnthony Denny’s own handwriting: “Strena facta pro anthony deny\r\ncamerario regio quod in initio novi anni 1544 regi dedit.” He was then\r\nKing’s Chamberlain, and was knighted in the September of the year in\r\nwhich he made his royal master this handsome gift. Other notes occur on\r\nthe drawing, here and there illegible, made evidently for the guidance\r\nof the craftsman who carried out Holbein’s design, which is simpler,\r\nthough no less characteristic in style, than his drawing for Queen Jane\r\nSeymour’s gold cup.\r\n\r\nFootnote 633:\r\n\r\n  Brit.

One of the\r\nfinest, and most elaborate, is the large pen-and-wash drawing, 17⅞ in. ×\r\n4⅝ in., in the British Museum, which was purchased in 1874 from the Earl\r\nof Wicklow’s collection (Pl. 44).[635] The handle has spiral bands set\r\nwith stones, and numerous pearls are also set in the sheath, the hilt,\r\nand the guard. These gems are held or supported by a number of nude\r\nfigures of women, old men, satyrs, and children amid foliage, each one\r\nfull of individual character, and drawn as only Holbein could draw them.\r\nIt was evidently intended for execution in chiselled gold or silver, and\r\nproduces an effect of great splendour. Only the right half of the sheath\r\nis drawn, as the design was to be repeated on the other side. There is\r\nan alternative design for parts of the hilt in the Basel Gallery.[636]\r\nIn the latter collection there is also a study for the sheath of a short\r\nsword or cutlass in which a somewhat similar arrangement has been\r\ncarried out.[637] It is an offset taken by Holbein from a pen-and-ink\r\ndrawing. Another of the Basel designs is for a powder-flask, possibly to\r\nbe executed in bone or ivory, in which naked cupids are intermingled\r\nwith the foliage.[638]\r\n\r\nFootnote 635:\r\n\r\n  Brit.

Reproduced by His, Pl. xxxi. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 638:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by His, xxxi. 3.\r\n\r\nThere is a splendid design for a dagger sheath in the Bernburg Ducal\r\nLibrary, which is divided into four compartments, the three upper ones\r\ncontaining figures in settings of Renaissance architecture.[639] In the\r\nuppermost is a group representing the Judgment of Paris. The youth, in\r\nsixteenth-century costume, reclines with his back against a pillar with\r\nMercury bending over him and offering him the apple, the three goddesses\r\nstanding in front of him, and Cupid aiming at him with a bow and arrow.\r\nThe next division shows the deaths of Pyramus, a cleverly foreshortened\r\nfigure beneath a fountain, and Thisbe, who is stabbing herself by his\r\nbody. Below is Venus within a scalloped niche, with the long ass’s ears\r\nof a jester, and a blindfolded cupid at her feet. The lowest compartment\r\ncontains scroll-work, the whole terminating in a cherub’s head within\r\nvolutes, with the initial H. at the bottom. There is a slighter\r\npreliminary pen study for this sheath in the Basel Gallery, which shows\r\na number of differences (Pl. 45 (3)).[640] Another dagger sheath at\r\nBasel is of particular interest because it is dated 1529,[641] and so\r\nmust have been drawn in Basel after Holbein’s return from his first\r\nvisit to England (Pl. 45 (1)). The design consists entirely of\r\nconventional foliage, seen against a black background, as though to be\r\nexecuted in chiselled open-work over some black material such as velvet,\r\nor to be filled in with niello. There are other sheaths in which the\r\nsubject stands out against a plain black background, one, in Berlin,\r\nwith a Dance of Death,[642] of which there is a repetition at Basel (Pl.\r\n46 (1)),[643] which appears to be an impression taken from the Berlin\r\ndrawing, strengthened and finished with Indian-ink, by some other hand\r\nthan Holbein’s; and another in the British Museum, with a Triumph of\r\nBellona,[644] of which only the sheath is by him. The hilt is obviously\r\nthe work of some other designer, in all probability, according to the\r\nBritish Museum catalogue, Peter Flötner of Nuremberg. It was formerly in\r\nthe Beckford Collection, and consists of two pieces of paper joined\r\ntogether, the hilt on one and the sheath on the other. Another sheath in\r\nthe Basel Gallery is decorated with a Roman Triumph (Pl. 46 (2)),[645]\r\nslightly drawn, in the manner of Mantegna, recalling the frieze in the\r\n1517 portrait of Benedikt von Hertenstein; and a second of a like\r\nquality, representing Joshua’s Passage of the Jordan (Pl. 46 (3)).[646]\r\nOther designs for the knobs and cross-pieces of dagger hilts will be\r\nfound in the British Museum (Pl. 47).\r\n\r\nFootnote 639:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 124.

Henry VIII\r\nwas lavish in his use of jewellery, and the fashion he set was slavishly\r\nfollowed by his courtiers. Dresses were loaded with gems and elaborate\r\nspecimens of the goldsmith’s art, and this delight in finery was carried\r\nto such an extent that it was a topic for jest and sarcasm among\r\nforeigners. More than one contemporary account gives details of the\r\nKing’s costume and the many jewels which adorned it, and the long\r\ninventories of his clothes and personal ornaments which still exist\r\nprove that continental visitors to his court did not exaggerate in the\r\ndescriptions of his person which they sent home. French and Italian\r\njewellers paid frequent visits to London, and sold him many gems and\r\nbeautiful specimens of gold and silver work and other art objects, while\r\nhe regularly employed a large number of English and resident foreign\r\njewellers. Their services were most in demand about New Year’s Day, when\r\ngifts were showered upon his Majesty, and he in return made many\r\npresents, often of great value. There is no doubt that some of these\r\ngifts were designed by Holbein, and that he served as designer to\r\nseveral of the leading London goldsmiths. The British Museum Collection\r\ncontains many designs for pendants and for jewels which were suspended\r\nround the neck by a ribbon or chain, this attachment being shown in a\r\nnumber of the studies (Pl. 48). In most of them table diamonds and other\r\nflat stones, together with pearls, are arranged in geometric patterns,\r\nthe interstices being filled with strap, scroll, or ribbon-work, or some\r\nconventional floral design. Occasionally at the top of the jewel there\r\nis a small grotesque or nude figure (Pl. 49). Many of the designs have a\r\nblack ground indicating niello or champlevé enamel. In some instances,\r\nhowever, the blackening may have been done merely to indicate the design\r\nmore clearly to the craftsman who was to carry it out. Some of them are\r\ncoloured and are often touched with gold, so that it is possible to tell\r\nthe jewels and materials it was intended to use. Several pendants are in\r\nthe shape of a cross, and others heart-shaped; one of the latter is of\r\ngold, with three pendant pearls, and two doves billing on a green bough\r\nin enamel, with the motto, TVRTVRVM CONCORDIA (Pl. 48 (3)).[647] Another\r\nshows the bust of a woman in Tudor dress holding between her hands a\r\nlarge table-cut stone, across which is written, apparently in another\r\nhand, “Well Laydi Well” (Pl. 49 (9)).[648] Several pendants are in the\r\nform of monograms, a very fine one consisting of the letters R. and E.\r\nin gold, with two rubies, an emerald, and a garnet at the four corners,\r\nhung by a ribbon above and with three pearls below (Pl. 48 (7));[649]\r\nmany of the designs, in fact, show one or more pearls suspended in this\r\nfashion. A jewel very similar to the last-named, formed of the sacred\r\nmonogram, is worn by Jane Seymour in her portrait at Vienna. Another\r\npendant monogram, with the initials H and I and an emerald in the centre\r\n(Pl. 48 (6)), was evidently designed for the King and his third\r\nQueen.[650] Several of them have mottoes, such as QVAM ACCIPERE DARE\r\nMVLTO BEATIVS (Pl. 49 (7)),[651] or PRVDENTEMENT ET PAR COMPAS\r\nINCONTINENT VIENDRAS,[652] the latter on a round device of two horns of\r\nplenty, two dolphins and a pair of compasses with serpents writhing\r\nround them (Pl. 50 (8)). Among the brooches there is one consisting of\r\nthree diamonds enwreathed by a scroll, on which is inscribed, MI LADI\r\nPRINSIS, and the same motto occurs on a second.[653]\r\n\r\nFootnote 647:\r\n\r\n  Brit.

They are decorated with metal and enamel\r\nin arabesque patterns, and one of them has the initials T.W. in the\r\ncentre, which are repeated in the corners, T.W. above and W.T.\r\nbelow.[654] On the second the same initials are combined with an I,[655]\r\nand in both cases it is probable that they were intended for Sir Thomas\r\nWyat. Two very similar designs appear to be for a jewelcase, or perhaps\r\na portable reliquary.[656] There is also an interesting drawing of a\r\nseal with the coat of arms of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, within\r\nthe garter and its motto, and around the whole a circular band inscribed\r\nCAROLVS DVX SVFFYCIE PRO HONORE SVO RICHEMOND (Pl. 50 (4)).[657] Among\r\nthe remaining studies are various devices, coats of arms, including\r\nHolbein’s own (Pl. 50 (6)), book clasps, bracelets, chains (Pl. 51 (3,\r\n4, and 5)), collars, rings, a number of monograms (Pl. 48 (1)), some of\r\nthem containing as many as eleven letters, probably concealing a\r\ncomplete name or the initials of the words of some device, grotesque\r\nfigures, winged warriors, nude women, and satyrs—the latter in some\r\ncases certainly intended for the foot of a vase, box, or salt-cellar, or\r\nsome such table ware—together with a variety of ornaments for which the\r\nexact purpose is not indicated. These last are largely fragments of\r\ncircular borders or segments of discs, decorated with arabesques on\r\nenamel (Pl. 52). In some of these designs for enamel the pattern is in\r\nwhite on a ground of blue and red or blue and black.\r\n\r\nFootnote 654:\r\n\r\n  Brit. Mus. Catg., 31 (_b_). Woltmann, 191.

This was the\r\ncircular medallion or _enseigne_ worn on the hat, and also, in the case\r\nof ladies, as a pendant at the end of a chain or ribbon, or in the shape\r\nof a brooch fastened to the front of the dress. They usually bore some\r\nfigure-subject, the earlier examples being, as a rule, religious, with\r\nfigures or emblems of saints or scenes from the Scriptures. In course of\r\ntime subjects taken from classical story or mediæval legend were used,\r\nand designs of a fanciful and allegorical nature. They became highly\r\npopular forms of personal adornment, and French and Italian jewellers\r\nbrought numbers of them over to London. “Every one, from the highest\r\nrank downwards,” says Mr. H. Clifford Smith, “had his personal _devise_\r\nor _impresa_, or more often a series of them. It was worn as an\r\nemblem—an ingenious expression of some conceit of the wearer, the\r\noutcome of his peculiar frame of mind. It usually contained some obscure\r\nmeaning, the sense of which, half hidden and half revealed, was intended\r\nto afford some play for the ingenuity of the observer. The love of the\r\ntime for expressing things by riddles led to the publication of sets of\r\nemblems, like those of Alciatus, which had imitations in all directions.\r\nEvery one, in fact, tried his hand at these ‘toys of the\r\nimagination.’”[661]\r\n\r\nFootnote 661:\r\n\r\n  H.

II., PLATE 52 DESIGNS FOR ARABESQUE ENAMEL ORNAMENTS\r\n  BRITISH MUSEUM\r\n]\r\n\r\nThat these hat-badges and brooches were worn by almost every one at\r\nHenry’s court is shown by their representation in many of Holbein’s\r\npictures and in a large number of the Windsor drawings. In the latter,\r\nunfortunately, the subjects are so slightly indicated that it is\r\nimpossible in most cases to make them out. They are to be found almost\r\ninvariably in the portraits of courtiers, the learned doctors and the\r\nmore soberly-attired German merchants not using them. Those worn by the\r\nmore wealthy were generally of gold, with the design in repoussé work,\r\nfrequently enamelled in colours, and often with precious stones set in\r\nthem. They were, as a rule, surrounded by a border or framework of\r\nsimilar workmanship, sometimes set with jewels. Some of them were\r\nfastened with a pin, like a brooch, others had loops or small holes\r\nround the edges so that they could be sewn to the hat. Henry VIII\r\npossessed a large collection of these ornaments. In a list dated 1526\r\nthere is mentioned, among many others, a crimson velvet bonnet, double\r\nturfed, with a brooch of St. Michael set with diamonds, and a white rose\r\non one side and a red rose on the other; and another of a buttoned cap\r\nof black velvet with a diamond and a brooch of Paris work of St. James.\r\nOther hats had brooches representing “three men and a pearl in the back\r\nof one of them”; a lady leading a brace of greyhounds; Venus and Cupids;\r\na lady holding a heart in her hand; another lady holding a crown;\r\nanother with a cameo head and a hanging pearl; “a man standing on a\r\nfaggot of fire”; “a handful of feathers”; “a gentleman in a lady’s lap”;\r\nand St. George, Hercules, and so on.[662] In another list, two years\r\nlater in date, there is mentioned “a brooch with a gentlewoman luting,\r\nwith a scripture over it.”[663] Occasionally these _enseignes_ are\r\ndescribed as “valentines of goldsmith’s work.” Most of the King’s hats\r\nwere also lavishly decorated with gold aglets.\r\n\r\nFootnote 662:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iv. pt. i. 1907.\r\n\r\nFootnote 663:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iv. pt. ii. 5114. See vol. i. p. 357.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESIGNS FOR MEDALLIONS]\r\n\r\nNone of the jewels included in these earlier lists can have been\r\ndesigned by Holbein; but after he became attached to the court he\r\nappears to have been constantly employed in this way, and it became, no\r\ndoubt, the fashion to wear an _enseigne_ or medallion of his devising.\r\nAmong his drawings, in the British Museum, at Basel, and at Chatsworth,\r\nthere are a number of small circular designs with figure-subjects which\r\nwere evidently intended for such purposes. Unfortunately, only in one\r\nsingle case has a design been found among his sketches which corresponds\r\nwith the gold-and-enamel badge worn by the sitter in one of his finished\r\npictures—the beautiful little drawing of “Lot and his Daughters” in the\r\nBritish Museum (Pl. 50 (2)), which, as recently pointed out by Mr.\r\nLionel Cust, was the design for the medallion shown in the portrait of\r\nCatherine Howard.[664] Very possibly some of the other _enseignes_ or\r\npendant roundels represented in his portraits were of his own devising,\r\nbut they are painted on so small a scale that the subjects upon them are\r\ndifficult to decipher.\r\n\r\nFootnote 664:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 195-196.\r\n\r\nThe medallion of “Lot and his Daughters” forms one of a numerous series\r\nof roundels, usually about 2½ in. in diameter, with subjects taken from\r\nthe Old Testament, the greater number of which are in the Basel\r\nsketch-book. Among the latter are three different studies on one sheet\r\nfor the subject of Hagar and Ishmael in the Wilderness,[665] and a\r\nfourth with Sarah giving Hagar to her husband;[666] the Sacrifice of\r\nCain and Abel;[667] Jacob embracing Rachel;[668] Jacob causing the stone\r\nto be removed from the well for Rachel,[669] a very beautiful little\r\ndrawing with an interesting group of buildings in the background; David\r\nand the Woman of Tekoah kneeling before him;[670] the Sacrifice of\r\nElijah, in which a jewel is inset to depict the fire on the altar;[671]\r\nand Moses and the destruction of Korah and his company.[672] This last\r\nis set within an open-work border with mermaids and cupids amid\r\nscroll-work. Several other subjects from the Old Testament, such as\r\nJudah and Tamar, and David playing before Saul, are to be found among\r\nthe engravings made by Wenceslaus Hollar from drawings by Holbein, now\r\nlost, when in the Arundel Collection. Among the subjects from the New\r\nTestament at Basel are the Baptism of Christ,[673] the Last\r\nJudgment,[674] and the Repentant Magdalen.[675] Two designs of the\r\nArchangel Michael slaying the Dragon are for the badge accompanying a\r\nchain of the order of St. Michael, and may have been drawn from the\r\nbadge belonging to Dinteville.[676] Another represents the kneeling\r\nfigures of a young couple in English dress holding a cup with a heart\r\nover it, evidently for “a valentine of goldsmith’s work.”[677] Among the\r\nunknown subjects is one in which a nude man is standing upon a prostrate\r\nknight, who with one hand shatters Cupid’s bow and with the other breaks\r\nthe fallen man’s sword;[678] one which repeats one of the subjects of\r\nthe Basel Town Hall wall-paintings—the blinding of Zaleucus;[679] and\r\nothers representing Juno and Callisto, Pomona, Leucothea on a dolphin,\r\nand two Centaurs.[680]\r\n\r\nFootnote 665:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 110 (37-43).

Reproduced by\r\n  His, Pl. xl.\r\n\r\nAt Chatsworth there is a sheet of drawings containing six _enseignes_\r\nand one larger design which appears to be for some kind of a\r\nsheath.[690] They are among the very finest examples of Holbein’s work\r\nin this field, drawn with the greatest delicacy, and admirable in\r\ncomposition. They represent (1) Hagar and Ishmael (Pl. 53 (2)), a\r\nvariant of the Basel design, in which the angel is flying towards Hagar,\r\nwho is seated under a tree, with the naked infant asleep under a bush,\r\nand on a scroll the names “Hagar” and “Ismael”; (2) The Last Judgment\r\n(Pl. 53 (3)), with Christ seated on clouds, and men and women kneeling\r\nbelow, with figures struggling out of graves, and on one side the\r\nyawning mouth of a dragon representing hell; (3) Icarus falling into the\r\nsea (Pl. 53 (1)), his wings melted by the sun, and Phœbus driving his\r\nchariot drawn by four winged horses through the sky; (4) Diana and\r\nActæon (Pl. 53 (5)), with four nude women standing in water on the left,\r\nand Actæon on the bank already turning into a stag, with his dogs\r\nattacking him, and others rushing through the wood in the background;\r\n(5) three beehives on a wooden stand under a roof of rushes (Pl. 53\r\n(6)), with Cupid, blindfolded, his bow on the ground, holding up his\r\nhands as though stung by the bees which are flying round him, and below\r\na shield for a coat of arms, coloured blue, and the motto, “NOCET EMPTA\r\nDOLORE VOLUPTA,” on a ribbon scroll, the whole surrounded by a band of\r\nconventional scroll pattern; (6) a man in sixteenth-century costume,\r\nwith folded arms, asleep on the grass, under an oak tree on a rocky\r\npiece of ground (Pl. 53 (7)). On the right is a large clock with hanging\r\nweights, the hands pointing to twelve o’clock, and the figure of a small\r\nchild pulling the rope of the hammer which strikes the bell. Round the\r\ntrunk of the tree is a scroll with the legend “ASPETTO LA HORA” (I await\r\nthe hour). This is possibly the design for a watch-back. These\r\nmedallions are in pen and bistre, with touches of red in some of the\r\nfigures, and green here and there in trees or grass. The remaining\r\ndesign seems to be for a short, broad sheath, but not, apparently, for a\r\nweapon (Pl. 53 (4)). It represents the Rape of Helen, who stands on the\r\nseashore, seized by the arms by two men, one wearing a helmet. A boat\r\ncontaining figures—some of them waving their hands—is coming towards\r\nthem over the water. There are some buildings on the left, and at the\r\nbottom, in the foreground, two nude figures with long spades digging in\r\nthe sand. The leg of one of these two figures projects beyond the\r\nboundary-line of the sheath, showing that the design was not intended\r\nfor a flat ornament, but was to be continued on both sides of the\r\nobject.[691]\r\n\r\nFootnote 690:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 131-7.

The great number of them, too,\r\nindicates that he must have found regular and lucrative employment in\r\nwork for the London jewellers and goldsmiths. Possibly those which\r\nremain formed only a small part of his total output. It has been\r\nsuggested, indeed, that none of the studies which have survived were\r\nactually carried out as ornaments, but were rather designs either\r\nrejected by the goldsmith or the patron for whom Holbein was working, or\r\nwere merely drawn by the artist as part of his stock-in-trade, from\r\nwhich clients could make their selection.[692] This supposition is based\r\non the fact that the drawings have always been carefully preserved in\r\nthe original sketch-books, and bear no traces of having undergone the\r\nrough usage of a goldsmith’s workshop. It does not seem at all probable,\r\nhowever, that this was the case; it is, indeed, absurd to suppose that\r\nthese designs, several hundreds in number, and many of them of the\r\ngreatest beauty, could have been rejected as not good enough by those\r\nfor whom they were prepared. It has been seen that the design for the\r\nmedallion with the subject of Lot and his Daughters was actually carried\r\nout for the adornment of Catherine Howard, to say nothing of those\r\nlarger drawings for the Jane Seymour Cup and the Denny astronomical\r\nclock, which, in any case, cannot have been rejected designs. A much\r\nsimpler explanation is that Holbein kept his original designs by him for\r\nfuture reference, and made other versions or copies, possibly sometimes\r\nmore elaborate in detail, for the use of the craftsmen who carried them\r\nout.\r\n\r\nFootnote 692:\r\n\r\n  See R. E. D. Sketchley, “Holbein as Goldsmith’s Designer,” in _Art\r\n  Journal_, June 1910, p. 175.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the cup designed for Hans of Antwerp, which shows\r\nthat the two men worked together, it is impossible to connect Holbein’s\r\nname directly with that of any one of the many goldsmiths who served the\r\ncourt; but it is probable that he was employed by at least several of\r\nthem, and almost certainly by Cornelis Hayes. There were an\r\nextraordinary number of such craftsmen, both native and foreign, in\r\nLondon at that period, and many others, more particularly Frenchmen and\r\nItalians, who paid periodical visits to England in order to sell works\r\nof art and jewels to the King and the nobility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE KING’S JEWELLERS]\r\n\r\nThe leading London jeweller of the earlier part of Henry’s reign was\r\nRobert Amadas, of Lombard Street, an alderman, who in 1526 was appointed\r\nMaster of the Jewel House, a post which he held until his death in 1532,\r\nwhen he was succeeded by Thomas Cromwell. Other leading goldsmiths were\r\nAlderman Sir John Mundy, appointed justice to the merchants of the\r\nSteelyard in 1525,[693] Alderman Robert Fenrother, Gerard Hughes, Robert\r\nLord, Nicholas and Henry Wooley, Thomas Trappes, William Holland, John\r\nTwiselton, John van Utricke, and Henry Holtesweller. Large sums were\r\nspent in New Year’s gifts, the King both giving and receiving many very\r\nvaluable presents. Thus in 1520 £1208, 17_s._ 6_d._ was paid to Amadas,\r\nTwiselton, and Holland for supplying such gifts, and in 1521 no less\r\nthan £1679, 15_s._ 10_d._, while smaller sums were received by other\r\ngoldsmiths.[694] There was also constant demand for gold and silver\r\nplate for presentation to foreign ambassadors and envoys, and for\r\nchristening presents for the children of the King’s favourites. Amadas\r\nsupplied many of these, as well as seals, jewels, spangles and other\r\nornaments for the jackets of the King’s Guards, silver bells, bosses,\r\nand nails for his Majesty’s use, and many other articles which need not\r\nbe specified. Amadas was dead before Holbein became attached to the\r\ncourt, and it is not at all likely that the latter designed for him. He\r\nmust, however, have been well acquainted with the Dutchman, Cornelis\r\nHayes, or Heyes, who became a naturalised Englishman in January\r\n1523,[695] and was afterwards one of the most regularly employed of the\r\ngoldsmiths specially appointed to the King’s service. He received\r\nlicence to keep six alien apprentices and twelve journeymen,\r\nnotwithstanding the statute of 14 & 15 Hen. VIII.[696] He supplied many\r\njewels for Anne Boleyn, including “a diamond in a brooch of our Lady of\r\nBoulogne,” and was employed, after Wolsey’s downfall, to remove the coat\r\nof arms from the Cardinal’s plate and place thereon the royal arms\r\ninstead. He was also frequently occupied in repairing and altering the\r\nroyal jewels and badges. His possible co-operation with Holbein, in\r\n1534, in connection with the making of a silver cradle and figures of\r\nAdam and Eve has been already mentioned,[697] and also that the piece of\r\nplate given to Holbein by the King in return for the portrait of Prince\r\nEdward was made by Hayes.[698] Holbein and Hayes had a common friend in\r\nBourbon, the French poet, who stayed with the goldsmith when in London.\r\n\r\nFootnote 693:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iv. pt. i. 1298.\r\n\r\nFootnote 694:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iii. pt. ii. pp. 1539, 1544 (King’s Book of Payments).\r\n\r\nFootnote 695:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. iii. pt. ii. 2807 (28).\r\n\r\nFootnote 696:\r\n\r\n  In May 1531. _C.L.P._, vol. v. 278 (8).\r\n\r\nFootnote 697:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 92-93.\r\n\r\nFootnote 698:\r\n\r\n  See p. 164.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VOL. II., PLATE 54\r\n  HENRY VIII GRANTING A CHARTER TO THE BARBER-SURGEONS’ COMPANY\r\n  BARBER-SURGEONS’ HALL, LONDON\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother goldsmith of importance was the Welshman Morgan Wolf, Fenwolf,\r\nor Phillip, one of the sewers of the chamber, and keeper of the castle\r\nand lordship of Abergavenny. Both he and the Englishman John Freeman\r\nsupplied many New Year’s gifts and other goldsmith’s work to Henry. The\r\nlatter was a protégé of Cromwell’s, who found him much employment in\r\nconnection with the dissolution of the monasteries, and granted him a\r\nnumber of fat appointments. Morgan Wolf engraved the Great Seal of\r\nEngland in 1543.[699] Among the foreign jewellers who came frequently to\r\nEngland, and some of whom eventually settled here, were Alart Plumier,\r\nor Plymmer, as he is called in the royal accounts, of Paris, who had\r\nfrequent dealings with the King; Jehan Lange, of the same city, who came\r\nover as the representative of several Parisian houses; Hubert\r\nMorett,[700] Christopher Herrault, Peter Romaynes, Guillim Ottener, John\r\nCrispin, Latronet, and Martin Garrard, the latter obtaining a patent of\r\ndenization in 1535. To prolong the list of names would be only tedious,\r\nfor it is impossible to connect Holbein’s name definitely with any one\r\nof them, though there is every probability that Cornelis Hayes and John\r\nof Antwerp both worked in conjunction with him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 699:\r\n\r\n  _C.L.P._, vol. xviii. pt. i. 463 (f. 87).\r\n\r\nFootnote 700:\r\n\r\n  See p. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n          THE BARBER-SURGEONS PICTURE AND THE PAINTER’S DEATH\r\n\r\nHolbein’s last important work, the Barber-Surgeons picture, left\r\n  unfinished by him—Description of it—Copy of it made for James I—Pepys’\r\n  attempt to purchase the original—Holbein’s death from the plague in\r\n  the autumn of 1543—Discovery of his will—His executor, John of\r\n  Antwerp, and his witnesses, Anthony Snecher, Olryck Obinger, and Harry\r\n  Maynert—Old mistake in the date of his death—History of Holbein’s\r\n  family—Englishmen named Holbein—His imitators—Painters who were\r\n  working in England at the time of his death and shortly\r\n  afterwards—Johannes Corvus and Gerlach Fliccius—Guillim Stretes—Hans\r\n  Eworthe—Thomas and John Bettes—Nicholas Lyzarde—Amberger—Copies of\r\n  Holbein’s pictures in English collections.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last important work upon which Holbein was engaged, a work left\r\nunfinished owing to his sudden death, was the large picture still\r\nhanging in the old hall of the Barber-Surgeons’ Company in Monkwell\r\nStreet, London (Pl. 54).[701] It was painted to commemorate the\r\nunification of the Company of Barbers and the Guild of Surgeons by Act\r\nof Parliament in the thirty-second year of Henry’s reign (1540-41), and\r\nmust have been begun shortly after the passing of the Act. At an earlier\r\nperiod the barbers and the surgeons of London had formed a single\r\ncompany, but in course of time had become separated; and upon their\r\nsecond coming together Holbein was called in to furnish a permanent\r\nrecord of the event. During the progress of the work he painted separate\r\nportraits of at least two of the sitters in the big picture—Dr. John\r\nChamber and Sir William Butts—just as he had painted individual\r\nlikenesses of Sir Thomas and Lady More when engaged upon the big group\r\nof the Chancellor’s family.\r\n\r\nFootnote 701:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, 202. Reproduced by A. F. Pollard, _Henry VIII_, p. 270;\r\n  Ganz, _Holbein_, p. 130.\r\n\r\nThe truth of Van Mander’s statement that Holbein left this large picture\r\nunfinished is apparent after even a cursory examination of it. That\r\nwriter, who regarded it as an “unusually splendid work,” says:\r\n\r\n“According to the feeling of some, Holbein is said not to have completed\r\nthe piece himself, but that the deficient parts were painted by some one\r\nelse. Nevertheless, if this be the truth, it must lead to the conclusion\r\nthat the completer of the work must have understood how to follow\r\nHolbein’s manner so judiciously that no painter or artist can from good\r\nreasons decide that various hands have been engaged in it.”[702]\r\n\r\nFootnote 702:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Woltmann, i. p. 474. Eng. trans., p. 444.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of Van Mander’s statement, however, is far from correct,\r\nfor the hand of a very inferior craftsman is plainly enough to be\r\ndiscerned over a greater part of the picture. The general arrangement of\r\nthe kneeling figures in the front rank, and the position assigned to the\r\nKing, were evidently Holbein’s, who had probably finished the heads, and\r\neven the robes, of several of the leading members of the Guild, while\r\nthe heads of others had possibly been traced on the panel from his own\r\npreliminary studies before death cut short his labours. For the rest,\r\nthe picture appears to have suffered from more than one later attempt to\r\nfinish it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESCRIPTION OF THE PICTURE]\r\n\r\nThe composition consists of nineteen figures. Henry VIII is shown\r\nfull-length on his throne, which is not placed in the centre of the\r\npicture, but somewhat to the spectator’s left. He is crowned and dressed\r\nin his full robes of state, holding the sword in his right and the\r\ncharter in his left hand. He is represented as far larger in size than\r\nthe other figures kneeling in front of him, something in the manner of\r\nearlier days, when the importance of the principal person in a painting\r\nwas brought home to the spectator by the simple plan of depicting him\r\nmuch bigger than those who surrounded him. This is a trick to which such\r\na master as Holbein would never have descended; indeed, the figure of\r\nthe King, who stares straight out of the picture with a dull, wooden\r\ncountenance, without evincing the slightest interest in the ceremony in\r\nwhich he is the chief performer, cannot even have been sketched in by\r\nHolbein, and is a stiff and clumsy performance at the best. The head has\r\nevidently been copied from one of the numerous likenesses of Henry of\r\nthe type of the Warwick portrait, without any attempt to alter the\r\nposition of the face or to connect it with the presentation which is\r\ntaking place. The position of the head may have been indicated by\r\nHolbein on the panel, and Woltmann is probably right in his conjecture\r\nthat it was his intention to represent him standing on the steps of the\r\nthrone, and not seated, which would account for the height of the face\r\nas it now is above the surrounding figures.[703] On the King’s right\r\nhand only three members of the Guild are kneeling—Chamber in the front,\r\nwith Butts next, and T. Alsop behind him. The three may have been thus\r\nplaced in the position of honour as the King’s personal physicians. All\r\nthree wear a furred gown and a doctor’s cap. The head of Chamber is\r\nexcellent, and appears to be wholly Holbein’s work, with little or no\r\nretouching; that of Butts has suffered more severely from incompetent\r\nhands, while the Alsop is much weaker. It is in this part of the\r\npicture, and in one or two of the heads on the opposite side, that\r\nHolbein carried his work almost entirely to completion. Eight men kneel\r\nin the front row on the King’s left, headed by T. Vicary, who receives\r\nthe charter from the royal hand, five of them with beards, and some of\r\nthem with skull-caps, and wearing more elaborate costumes and gowns than\r\nthose opposite to them. The second figure, T. Aylif, the Warden, is one\r\nof the most effective, the head, though here again retouching is very\r\nevident, being perhaps the best of all. The heads of Harman and Monforde\r\nare noteworthy among the remainder of the figures, the greater number of\r\nwhich have been so badly repainted that no touch of Holbein’s hand is\r\nnow visible; though it is possible that in some cases he was responsible\r\nfor the outline. According to Dr. Woltmann, traces of the pinholes by\r\nmeans of which the transference of Holbein’s original sketches of the\r\nheads to the panel was made, can still be seen in several instances.\r\nBehind the eight kneeling members of the Company on the spectator’s\r\nright there appears an upper row of seven figures, which must have been\r\nadded at a considerably later date than that of the finishing process\r\ngiven to the picture at some time shortly after Holbein’s death. These\r\nlater figures are so badly placed that they entirely spoil the\r\ncomposition, and are quite devoid of artistic merit, being the work of a\r\nstill weaker hand than that of the unknown “finisher.” They evidently\r\nformed no part of the original arrangement, but represent later members\r\nof the company who wished their portraits to be included. The panel is\r\nfurther marred by the fact that over each sitter, with the exception of\r\nfive in the last-named row, his name is inscribed in large letters.\r\nAnother late addition, which also helps to spoil the general effect, is\r\na large white tablet on the wall on the right, which contains a long\r\nLatin inscription in prose and verse in praise of the King. Originally\r\nthis space was occupied by a window, through which could be seen the old\r\ntower of the church of St. Bride’s, showing that the ceremony was\r\nrepresented as taking place in the palace of Bridewell. Behind the King\r\nhangs a large gold-embroidered curtain, and on either side of it the\r\nspace is roughly filled in with flowers and fruit representing tapestry.\r\nAccording to Dr. Ganz,[704] it is the same chamber, with the same\r\nhangings, probably the throne-room in Whitehall, as in the large picture\r\nof the family of Henry VIII at Hampton Court (No. 340 (510)),[705] which\r\nhas been attributed by some writers to Guillim Stretes; and again, in a\r\nportrait of Queen Elizabeth in the possession of the Earl of\r\nBuckinghamshire. It is possible that the King may have sat for the\r\npicture at Whitehall, and that Holbein made use of the surroundings at\r\nhis hand, but the view from the window in the copy of the\r\nBarber-Surgeons painting, mentioned below, seems to indicate that the\r\nroom represented was in Bridewell. There is no resemblance between the\r\npatterns of the carpets in the two pictures. It is painted on a panel\r\nmade up of a number of thick, vertical oak boards, and is 10 ft. 3 in.\r\nwide by 6 ft. high. In Woltmann’s opinion, “the picture is nothing but a\r\nruin, in which we have to search with difficulty for the traces of\r\nHolbein.”[706]\r\n\r\nFootnote 703:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. p. 475.\r\n\r\nFootnote 704:\r\n\r\n  See _Holbein_, p. 243.\r\n\r\nFootnote 705:\r\n\r\n  The central part of this picture, showing Henry VIII enthroned, with\r\n  Edward VI and Queen Catherine Parr on either side of him, is\r\n  reproduced by Mr. Ernest Law in _The Royal Gallery of Hampton Court_,\r\n  p. 130.\r\n\r\nFootnote 706:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, Eng. trans., p. 446.\r\n\r\nThis opinion, and an almost similar one given by Wornum, were regarded\r\nby the late Sir Charles Robinson as far too scathing.[707] He considered\r\nthat Holbein’s hand had worked more or less over every part of the great\r\npanel—very elaborately and minutely in some parts and very slightly in\r\nothers; but that nowhere had the finishing touches and work required to\r\ngive final truth and perfection of representation been bestowed. He\r\nthought that an interval of some twenty or thirty years must have\r\nelapsed before the Barber-Surgeons, in an inauspicious moment,\r\ndetermined on the completion of their picture, the superadded work\r\nseeming to be that of a somewhat advanced Elizabethan period. It must\r\nalways be a matter of deep regret that they did not leave it in the\r\nstate in which it came to them from Holbein’s studio, for it would have\r\nbeen of infinitely greater value than it is now. Finished by him it\r\ncould not have been less than a masterpiece; but even in its incomplete\r\nstate it would have been of equal interest as forming an invaluable\r\nexample of his technique and methods of working.\r\n\r\nFootnote 707:\r\n\r\n  In a letter to _The Times_, 28th August 1895.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COPY MADE FOR JAMES I]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of January 1618 James I wrote from Newmarket to the Company\r\nasking that the picture should be lent to him, as he was anxious to have\r\na copy made of it, and promising that this should be done expeditiously,\r\nand the original redelivered safely. “We are informed,” he said, “there\r\nis a table of Painting in your Hall whereon is the Picture of our\r\nPredecessor of famous memorie K. Henry the 8th., together w^h diverse of\r\ny^r Companie, w^h being both like him and well done Wee are desirous to\r\nhave copyd.”[708] Holbein’s name is not mentioned in this letter. The\r\ncopy then made is in all probability the one now in the possession of\r\nthe Royal College of Surgeons,[709] which is smaller than the original,\r\nand an indifferent version of it, on paper attached to canvas. The\r\nfigure of Alsop, on the extreme right of the King, is omitted, and in\r\nplace of the tablet with the inscription, the window with a view of the\r\nchurch tower is shown, proving that even if it is not the copy ordered\r\nby James I, it is at least a very early version of the original. It was\r\nat one time in the collection of Desenfans, and at his sale in 1786 was\r\npurchased by the Surgeons’ Company for fifty guineas. It has been\r\nincorrectly described as the original cartoon for the picture, and it\r\nhas also been said, but this again is wrong, that it belonged at one\r\ntime to the Barber-Surgeons’ Company, and that when the two branches of\r\nthe Guild were finally separated in 1745, the College retained the copy\r\nor cartoon and the Company kept the picture.[710]\r\n\r\nFootnote 708:\r\n\r\n  The original letter is in the possession of the Company.\r\n\r\nFootnote 709:\r\n\r\n  The College also possesses a second copy of the picture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 710:\r\n\r\n  In 1789 this copy was cleaned and put in order by a man named Lloyd,\r\n  who asked £400 for his labours, but eventually took fifty guineas.\r\n\r\nThe next reference to the picture occurs in Pepys’ _Diary_, under the\r\ndate August 29, 1668. The entry runs: “At noon, comes by appointment\r\nHarris to dine with me; and after dinner, he and I to Chirurgeons’ Hall,\r\nwhere they are building it new, very fine; and there to see their\r\ntheatre, which stood all the fire, and, which was our business, their\r\ngreat picture of Holbein’s, thinking to have bought it, by the help of\r\nMr. Pierce, for a little money. I did think to give 200_l._ for it, it\r\nbeing said to be worth 1000_l._; but it is so spoiled that I have no\r\nmind to it, and is not a pleasant though a good picture.” The fire of\r\nwhich Pepys speaks was the great fire of 1666, and the damage to which\r\nhe refers may have been caused to some extent by the smoke, though it is\r\nmore probable that the injury he noted was merely that caused by time\r\nand restoration. Wornum suggests that it underwent restoration shortly\r\nafter the Great Fire, and that the tablet with the inscription was then\r\nintroduced in place of the original window.[711] The entry in the\r\n_Diary_ further shows how high a value the Company placed on the picture\r\neven in those days, and also that they were prepared to sell it at their\r\nown price.[712]\r\n\r\nFootnote 711:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 352, who quotes the whole of the Latin inscription.\r\n\r\nFootnote 712:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix (M).\r\n\r\nIn 1734 the Company commissioned Bernard Baron to engrave the picture\r\nfor the sum of 150 guineas. The plate, which is a large one, and a\r\nfairly accurate transcript of the original, except that it is reversed,\r\nwas published in 1736. It was dedicated to the Earl of Burlington, with\r\na Latin inscription. In 1856 it was engraved on wood for the\r\n_Illustrated London News_ by Henry Linton.[713] In 1895 the Company were\r\nagain anxious to sell it, and an effort was made to purchase it for the\r\nnation, but unfortunately the scheme fell through, possibly because the\r\nextravagant price of £15,000 was asked for it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 713:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced in Mantz, p. 172.\r\n\r\nWhile still engaged upon this important work, Holbein’s life was cut\r\nshort by the plague, which raged so severely in London in the summer and\r\nautumn of 1543 that hundreds of people died each week from it. According\r\nto Hall, “Thys yeare was in London a great death of the Pestilence, and\r\ntherefore Mighelmas Tearme was adjourned to Saynt Albons”; and Stow\r\nrepeats this statement almost word for word.[714] Holbein succumbed to\r\nit on some date between the 7th of October and 29th of November. This\r\nwas proved by the discovery of his will in February 1861, by Mr. W. H.\r\nBlack, F.S.A., who found it in one of the Registers of the Commissary of\r\nLondon, at that time preserved in the Record Room at St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral. It is included in the book called “Beverly,” on folios 116\r\nand 121, that volume covering the period from 1539 to 1548. It runs as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFootnote 714:\r\n\r\n  Hall, _The Union of the Two Noble and Illustrate Families of Lancastre\r\n  and Yorke_, 1548, p. 257.

The right of each intact. Said day of month,\r\n    &c.][715]\r\n\r\nFootnote 715:\r\n\r\n  See Sir A. W. Franks, _Archæologia_, vol. xxxix., p. 2, and W. H.\r\n  Black, same vol., p. 275.\r\n\r\nAccording to these entries, John of Antwerp was Holbein’s executor,\r\nalthough he is not so mentioned in the will, and on the 29th November he\r\nrenounced all execution of it, and took out letters of administration\r\nonly. The will itself appears to have been drawn up carelessly and in\r\nhaste; probably Holbein was already sickening when he made it, so that\r\nit had to be done in a hurry, or he may have been merely alarmed, owing\r\nto the number of people daily dying around him, including, as Mr. Lionel\r\nCust points out,[716] some members of John of Antwerp’s own household,\r\nin whose dwelling, he suggests, Holbein may himself have contracted the\r\ndisease. The meaning of the two official acts is not easy to follow, but\r\nthe explanation given by Sir Augustus W. Franks, F.S.A., procured from a\r\nlegal source, is no doubt the correct one. “Though the two official acts\r\nwhich follow the copy of the Will may at first appear inconsistent both\r\nwith the Will and also with each other; yet, if we suppose that John\r\nAnwarpe was considered to have been appointed executor by implication\r\n(which the law allowed), much of the seeming inconsistency will\r\ndisappear. The object of the renunciation may have been either to\r\nobviate some doubt which existed as to whether John Anwarpe was so made\r\nexecutor (for the language is hardly strong enough), or to avoid certain\r\nliabilities that would have affected him as executor, but not as\r\nadministrator. Formerly a person was said to have died intestate, not\r\nonly when he left no Will, but also when he left a Will and appointed no\r\nexecutor, or appointed executors and they all renounced. In this\r\nadministration act the testator is accordingly said to have died\r\nintestate. The great difficulty in these official acts is how John\r\nAnwarpe could have been executor and Mr. Anthony not. The second of the\r\ntwo is almost a repetition of the first, and both are dated on the same\r\nday.”[717]\r\n\r\nFootnote 716:\r\n\r\n  _Burlington Magazine_, vol. viii., February 1906, p. 360. See also p.\r\n  13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 717:\r\n\r\n  _Archæologia_, vol. xxxix. p. 15.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN’S WILL]\r\n\r\nThe will is of great interest, not only as proving the date of Holbein’s\r\ndeath within a week or two, but also as affording some information as to\r\nhis worldly position and his personal friends. Although his practice in\r\nLondon was a large one, he died somewhat heavily in debt, and the\r\ninference is that he had not saved money. What his personal possessions\r\nconsisted of, the document, so hastily drawn, does not say, but, unlike\r\na number of his fellow-artists, he does not seem to have owned any\r\nproperty in London. It does not necessarily follow, however, that he was\r\nextravagant in his habits, though he kept a horse and owed money. It has\r\nbeen assumed that the frequent payment of his salary in advance was due\r\nto improvidence; but there is nothing beyond the terms of his will to\r\nsupport this, or to show that he spent all his income on himself, and\r\nthat he failed to send money regularly to Basel in support of his wife\r\nand family. The reference to his two children at nurse indicates some\r\nirregular connection in England, which may have been one of the reasons\r\nwhich made him disinclined to return permanently to Basel in accordance\r\nwith the wish of his fellow-townsmen. Considering the laxity of morals\r\nat that period, the fact that he had a second family in London is not\r\nvery surprising. It has been suggested that the mother of these children\r\ndied of the plague shortly before the artist, and that his will was made\r\nthrough anxiety to provide for them should he in turn be taken with the\r\nrapid and usually fatal disease, to which most victims succumbed within\r\nthree days. The amount bequeathed for these children’s maintenance,\r\nabout three half-pence a day each, does not seem much, but when the\r\nrelative value of money at that time is taken into consideration, it was\r\nno doubt enough for their simple needs. What eventually became of them\r\nis not known.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the four witnesses to the will, all of whom were, no\r\ndoubt, personal friends of the painter, nothing is known with any\r\ncertainty except as regards John of Antwerp. The Mr. Anthony of\r\nGreenwich, one of the King’s servants, to whom Holbein owed the\r\nconsiderable amount of £10, 13_s._ 7_d._, is evidently the same\r\nindividual who witnessed the will as Anthony Snecher, armourer, although\r\nthe words “before said” do not occur against his name as witness as they\r\ndo in the case of John of Antwerp. Both Mr. Black and Sir A. Franks,\r\nhowever, appear to have regarded them as two distinct persons.[718] The\r\nformer suggested that “Mr. Anthony” was Anthony Anthony, one of the\r\nofficers of the Ordnance Department, who had some skill as an\r\nilluminator, if the embellishments of certain rolls dealing with the\r\nnavy and signed by him were from his hand, as is probable. The latter\r\nthought that Anthony Snecher was possibly one of the body of German\r\narmourers in the regular employment of the King at Greenwich, of whom\r\nErasmus Kirkheimer was the chief, and that Holbein may have supplied him\r\nwith designs for the ornamentation of weapons. Mr. J. Gough Nichols\r\nsuggested that Mr. Anthony may have been Anthony Toto, the painter, with\r\nwhom Holbein must have been acquainted, and with whom he may have worked\r\nin conjunction with other foreign artists upon the decoration of Nonsuch\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\nFootnote 718:\r\n\r\n  See _Archæologia_, vol. xxxix. pp. 13-14, and 274.\r\n\r\nOf Olryck Obinger, the merchant, nothing is known, but from his name he\r\nmust have been a Swiss or German, possibly a merchant of the Steelyard,\r\nthough there is no reference to him in the State Papers, which contain\r\nthe names of a large number of the members of that body. From his name,\r\ntoo, Harry Maynert, the painter, also appears to have been a German or a\r\nFleming. He remains an indefinite figure at present.[719] Mr. Black\r\nsuggested that he might be a relation of the John Maynard who was one of\r\nthe painters employed on the tomb of Henry VII. A relationship is also\r\npossible with the Katherine Maynors, of Antwerp, a painter, who obtained\r\nletters of denization in England in 1540, at which time she was a widow.\r\n\r\nFootnote 719:\r\n\r\n  The fine miniature by Holbein at Munich, bearing the initials H. M.,\r\n  which Dr. Ganz suggests may be a portrait of Harry Maynert, is\r\n  described on pp. 241-2.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PLACE OF HIS BURIAL]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the will put an end to the tradition which had existed\r\nfrom the beginning of the seventeenth century that Holbein died in 1554.\r\nThis mistake is to be traced back to the publication of Carel van\r\nMander’s _Het Schilder Boeck_, published in 1604, two years before the\r\nwriter’s death. In his account of Holbein he concludes by saying: “Soo\r\nis Holbeen in groote benoutheydt te Londen ghestorven van de Pest A^o\r\n1554, oudt 56 Jaren.” [Thus did Holbein die in London, of the plague, in\r\ngreat distress, in the year 1554, fifty-six years old. Succeeding\r\nwriters copied from Van Mander. Joachim von Sandrart repeated the\r\nstatement in his _Teutsche Akademie_—“Wurde er 1554 im 56 Jahre seines\r\nAlters von der damals in Londen wütenden Pest hingerafft”—and later\r\nbiographers continued the error, which led to great confusion, as it\r\nadded eleven years to the painter’s life, and caused almost all Tudor\r\nportraits bearing dates between 1544 and 1554 to be attributed to him.\r\nWornum suggests that the letter from the Burgomaster of Basel to Jacob\r\nDavid, the Parisian goldsmith, with reference to Philip Holbein, which\r\nis dated 1545 and speaks of Holbein, the father, as then deceased, may\r\nhave been shown to Van Mander or copied for him, and that in\r\ntranscribing it, or even in the printing of his book, the last two\r\nfigures of the date were accidentally transferred, so that 45 was turned\r\ninto 54.[720] Such mistakes are not of uncommon occurrence, and this\r\nsolution may be the true one. There was no plague raging in London in\r\n1554, while in 1543 there was an unusually severe visitation. Otherwise\r\nVan Mander’s account of the painter’s death is substantially correct.\r\nThe place of his burial remains uncertain, but according to tradition,\r\nas voiced by Strype, he was interred in the church of St. Catherine\r\nCree. Strype, in his additions to Stow’s _Survey of the Cities of London\r\nand Westminster_,[721] says: I have been told that _Hans Holben_, the\r\ngreat and inimitable painter in King Henry VIII’s Time, was buried in\r\nthis Church; and that the Earl of _Arundel_, the great Patron of\r\nLearning and Arts, would have set up a Monument to his Memory here, had\r\nhe but known whereabouts the Corps lay.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 720:\r\n\r\n  Wornum, p. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 721:\r\n\r\n  1720, Book II. p. 64.\r\n\r\nThe same story was told by Sandrart, without mentioning the church. He\r\nsupposed that the Earl’s difficulty arose from the fact that so many\r\npeople were dying daily, and had to be buried in such haste, that\r\nHolbein probably shared a common grave with others, and that no record\r\nwould be kept. There can be little doubt that he would be buried in or\r\nnear the parish in which he was residing. The church of St. Catherine\r\nCree, though in the next parish, is not many hundred yards distant from\r\nthe Church of St. Andrew Undershaft, and it is probable that Holbein was\r\ninterred in one or the other of them, possibly the latter, confusion as\r\nto the exact locality having arisen at a later date owing to the close\r\nproximity of the two churches. Unfortunately no registers of the time\r\nare available. St. Andrew Undershaft escaped the Great Fire, but its\r\nregister from 1538 to 1579 has disappeared, while that of St. Catherine\r\nCree begins only in 1663.\r\n\r\nHolbein’s wife and family are not mentioned in his will, and what little\r\nis known of their further history is largely due to the researches of\r\nDr. His-Heusler in the Basel archives. His wife survived him for six\r\nyears, dying early in 1549, after a somewhat lengthy illness, as on the\r\n9th of July in the preceding year she appointed, for this reason, a\r\ndeputy to manage her affairs. It is to be gathered that she was left by\r\nHolbein in a fairly comfortable position, what with the annual pension\r\nallowed her by the civic authorities, the two houses which her husband\r\nhad purchased fifteen years earlier, and the legacy from his uncle\r\nSigmund, which the painter does not appear to have touched. Nor does it\r\nfollow, because she was not mentioned in the will, that he had failed to\r\nsend to her at least a part of his English earnings. An inventory taken\r\non the 8th of March 1549, shortly after her death, shows that she was\r\nfairly well provided with worldly goods. In addition to furniture, an\r\nample supply of linen, and the more ordinary household utensils, she\r\npossessed two silver-gilt covered cups, six silver goblets, a dozen\r\nsilver-plated spoons, and a valise with a portion of her deceased\r\nhusband’s wardrobe, including a black cap, a Spanish cape trimmed with\r\nvelvet, a doublet of smoke-coloured Florentine taffeta, and others of\r\nblack satin, crimson silk, and black damask. These garments must have\r\nbeen left behind by Holbein when he visited Basel in 1538, rather than\r\nforwarded after his death by his executor, who, according to the terms\r\nof the will, was obliged to sell everything. His stepson, Franz Schmid,\r\nwho carried on his father’s tanning business, died before his mother,\r\nleaving two children.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN’S DESCENDANTS]\r\n\r\nSome years after 1545, Holbein’s eldest son, Philip, having completed\r\nhis apprenticeship to Jacob David in Paris, from whose service he only\r\nobtained release after the Basel Town Council had come to his\r\nassistance, worked for a time as a goldsmith in Lisbon, and finally\r\nsettled in Augsburg, where he founded a diamond-cutting business. He in\r\nturn had a son named Philip, who, in 1611, petitioned the Emperor\r\nMatthias for a confirmation and augmentation of “his old and noble coat\r\nof arms.” In this document, in which he describes himself as Imperial\r\ncourt jeweller and a citizen of Augsburg, he speaks of his grandfather\r\nJohann, as “the painter at that time celebrated throughout Europe,” and\r\nasserts that the Holbeins were descended from a noble family of the\r\n“city of Uri.” This last statement, however, was largely imaginary, and\r\nhad its sole foundation in the fact that the Holbein arms[722] were the\r\nsame as those of the canton of Uri, with the exception that the latter\r\nlacked the star between the bull’s horns. This Philip Holbein, who,\r\naccording to Von Mechel, had been living in Vienna since 1600, had his\r\npetition granted on the 1st October in the following year, 1612. In 1756\r\none of his descendants, Johann Georg Holbein, who was connected with the\r\nCourt of Chancery, obtained a confirmation of the noble rank granted to\r\nhis family in 1612, with the surname of Holbeinsberg, and in 1787 was\r\nraised to the rank of a Knight of the Empire, with the title of a noble\r\nof Holbeinsberg.\r\n\r\nFootnote 722:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. p. 83.\r\n\r\nHolbein’s elder daughter, Katherine, married in 1545 a butcher named\r\nJacob Gyssler, a widower with a grown-up daughter. Among the papers of\r\nLudwig Iselin there is a list of all the deaths which occurred in Basel\r\nbetween 1588 and 1612, from which we learn that she died on February 8,\r\n1590. She is described as Katharina Holbeinin, daughter of the deceased\r\nHans Holbein, the distinguished painter, wife of a butcher. The second\r\ndaughter, Küngolt, or Kunigunde, after the death of her mother, married\r\na miller named Andreas Syff. They had a numerous family, and one of\r\ntheir granddaughters married Friedrich Merian, brother of the well-known\r\nengraver, Matthaüs Merian. Küngolt, according to Iselin’s list, died\r\nseven months after her sister, on September 15, 1590. She is described\r\nin the same terms, as the daughter of the celebrated artist. In this\r\nlist there also occurs the name of a third lady of the Holbein family,\r\nwho died on the 17th September 1594, but she is merely described as\r\n“Felicitas Holbein, wife of Conrad Volmar, died of the plague,” and it\r\nis not certain that she was one of the painter’s daughters. Nothing is\r\nknown of the younger son, Jacob Holbein, except that he also became a\r\ngoldsmith, and that he came to England and died in London in the summer\r\nof 1552. In 1549, at the time of his mother’s death, he was still a\r\nminor, and the document in the Basel archives dealing with the division\r\nof his property after his death is dated June 27, 1552. No other record\r\nof his presence in London has been so far traced.\r\n\r\nThe name occurs in England both before and after Hans Holbein’s\r\nresidence here, but in every case the bearers of it were almost\r\ncertainly Englishmen. Walpole mentions a Holbein, on the authority of an\r\nentry in a register at Wells,[723] as living in the reign of Henry VII,\r\nand conjectures him to have been a foreigner, and even a relation of\r\nHans, and the possible author of some early paintings, including a\r\nportrait of Henry VII. In this, however, he was wrong. His Holbein was\r\nevidently an English country gentleman, and probably some relative of a\r\ncertain Johannes Holbyn of North Stoke, close to Bath, who died in 1548,\r\nand left a sum of money to the Cathedral of Wells. The wills of two\r\nother well-to-do persons of this name occur in the registry of the\r\nArchidiaconal Court of Canterbury—that of John Holbein of Folkestone,\r\ndated August 21, 1534, who bequeathed forty-six shillings and eightpence\r\nfor a new covered font for the parish church, and of his widow, who died\r\nshortly after him, which is dated November 25, 1534, and was proved in\r\nthe following January. These people were all English, and had no\r\nconnection with the painter.[724]\r\n\r\nFootnote 723:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, i. p. 49.\r\n\r\nFootnote 724:\r\n\r\n  See Sir A. W. Franks, _Archæologia_, vol. xxxix. p. 16; W. H. Hart,\r\n  _Proceedings Soc. of Antiq._, 16th April 1863; and Wornum, p. 372.\r\n\r\nHolbein founded no school of painting either in England or Switzerland,\r\nand there is no evidence to show that he had any pupils. It is probable\r\nthat he employed assistants when engaged upon such wall-paintings as\r\nthose he carried out in Whitehall, but whoever they may have been, their\r\nengagement was only a temporary one. As already noted, there is no\r\nrecord, as there is in the case of several other foreign artists then\r\nresident in this country, of a royal warrant according him the privilege\r\nof employing in regular service a number of alien assistants or servants\r\nin spite of the Act which made such a proceeding illegal. No pupil of\r\nhis is mentioned by any of his early biographers, and it seems almost\r\ncertain that no one directly studied under him. If there had been such a\r\npainter, some record of him is almost certain to have survived. There\r\nare a number of portraits, as a rule of no very great artistic merit, in\r\nvarious private collections in England, which were evidently painted\r\nindirectly under his influence. Such examples are to be expected, for it\r\nwas impossible for so great a master to be at work in London for so many\r\nyears without a certain number of imitators springing up, who attempted\r\nto work in his methods and to copy his style. It is hardly possible now\r\nthat even the names of these third-rate imitators and ineffectual rivals\r\nwill be unearthed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GUILLIM STRETES]\r\n\r\nAs already stated, prior to the discovery of his will almost all\r\npaintings bearing dates between 1543 and 1554 were ascribed to him; even\r\nto-day, in some instances, the owners, in spite of the impossibility,\r\nstill adhere to the great name, as the catalogues of most of the\r\nexhibitions held within recent years dealing with the Tudor period\r\nafford proof. The authorship of these pictures must be sought for\r\nelsewhere, though in many cases the task is one of extreme difficulty.\r\nSeveral painters of considerable talent were at work at the English\r\ncourt during the years immediately following Holbein’s death, and in\r\nsome instances signed and authenticated works by them exist which enable\r\ncomparisons to be made and certain unsigned works from their hands to be\r\nidentified with some confidence. Such men as these were Johannes Corvus\r\nand Gerlach Fliccius; but in other cases, such as that of Guillim\r\nStretes, only the names and a few scanty records remain, and it is\r\nimpossible to point to any picture which can be said with absolute\r\ncertainty to have been produced by them. Lucas Hornebolt died in 1544,\r\nabout six months later than Holbein, and in the same year Girolamo da\r\nTreviso was killed by a cannon-ball at the siege of Boulogne. Several of\r\nthe leading Italian artists, however, continued to serve the court\r\nduring the remainder of Henry VIII’s life and throughout the succeeding\r\nreign, such as Antonio Toto, the sergeant-painter, his colleague,\r\nBartolommeo Penni, and Nicolas Bellin of Modena, though no signed or\r\nauthenticated picture by any one of them has survived.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of Holbein’s immediate successors was the\r\nDutch painter, Guillim or Gillam Stretes, though so far no mention of\r\nhim has been found prior to the accession of Edward VI. Strype’s extract\r\nfrom the records of the Privy Council, having reference to a payment of\r\nfifty marks made to him for two pictures of the young King and one of\r\nthe Earl of Surrey, has been already quoted,[725] as well as the fact\r\nthat in 1553 he was receiving, as King’s painter, an annuity of £62,\r\n10_s._, more than double Holbein’s salary, showing that he was a person\r\nof importance among the painters of Edward’s reign. Reference has also\r\nbeen made to the attribution to Stretes of the full-length portrait of\r\nHenry Howard, Earl of Surrey, in the collection of the Duke of Norfolk\r\nat Arundel Castle,[726] and of the duplicate version, without the\r\npainted framework, at Knole.[727] The attribution of these two works to\r\nStretes is based entirely on the Privy Council order. Dr. Waagen[728]\r\nstated that the Arundel Castle portrait was inscribed “William Strote,”\r\nbut no one else has succeeded in discovering this signature, and very\r\npossibly the name he quotes was seen by him on some old label then\r\nattached to the frame and since removed. These two portraits, as already\r\nnoted, have been grouped with several other full-lengths, including the\r\nyoung man in red at Hampton Court Palace (No. 345 (315)), wrongly\r\ndescribed as a portrait of the Earl of Surrey,[729] that of Sir Thomas\r\nGresham, dated 1544, in Mercers’ Hall, the beautiful portrait of William\r\nWest, Lord Delawarr,[730] belonging to Lieut.-Col. G. L. Holford,\r\nC.I.E., C.V.O., and the one of the Earl of Southampton, 1542, in the\r\nFitzwilliam Museum.[731] These portraits display somewhat close\r\naffinities, though it is not possible to allow that all are by the same\r\nhand. The portrait of William West is a work of great power and\r\ncharacter, and has been attributed to Holbein himself, but the style of\r\nthe painting does not accord with his. All these works are of\r\nconsiderably earlier date than that of the Privy Council order, which is\r\nthe earliest reference so far discovered touching this painter, and it\r\nis extremely doubtful whether he had anything to do with them. One is on\r\nsafer ground in attributing to him some of the portraits of King Edward,\r\nwhich exist in considerable numbers, two of which he certainly painted,\r\nand very possibly others. These portraits of the young King, and\r\nStretes’ probable connection with them, have been dealt with in an\r\nearlier chapter.[732] One other picture Stretes is known to have\r\npainted, for it is recorded that on New Year’s Day, 1556, he presented\r\nQueen Mary with “a table of her Majesty’s Marriage.”[733] This picture,\r\nwhich must have been one of particular interest, has completely\r\ndisappeared. Dr. Williamson records a signed miniature by him of Edward\r\nVI, almost full-face, wearing a jewelled cap, in Earl Beauchamp’s\r\ncollection at Madresfield Court,[734] and he also attributes to the same\r\npainter a second miniature of the young King, as a little boy, in the\r\nRijks Museum, Amsterdam.[735]\r\n\r\nFootnote 725:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 168-170.\r\n\r\nFootnote 726:\r\n\r\n  Exhib.

His will,\r\nrecently discovered, which is dated 24th January 1558, and was proved by\r\nhis widow on the 11th February following, shows that he was living in\r\nthe parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate, and that he possessed lands\r\nand goods in Osnabrüch, of which place he was no doubt a native. In this\r\ndocument he calls himself “Drawer,” and gives his name as Garlick\r\nFlicke, and it was under the name of Garlick that he was generally known\r\nin this country. The Lumley inventory includes three portraits by him—a\r\nfull-length, described as “The Statuary of Thomas first Lo: Darcy of\r\nChiche, created by King Edw. 6. L^d Chamberlayne to the said K. Edw.:\r\ndrawn by Garlicke,” and two small ones of “Queen Marye, drawne by\r\nGarlicke,” and “Thomas, the third Duke of Northfolke, drawne by\r\nGarlicke.” Unfortunately these three portraits have disappeared—the\r\nfull-length of Lord Darcy in quite modern times. Until 1854 it was\r\nhanging in Irnham Hall, Lincolnshire, but in that year the house and its\r\ncontents were sold, and the present whereabouts of the picture has so\r\nfar not been traced. Miss Hervey gives a list of eight portraits which\r\ncan be attributed with more or less certainty to Fliccius. In addition\r\nto the three from the Lumley Collection, there are three others in the\r\ncollection of the Marquis of Lothian at Newbattle Abbey, Dalkeith, the\r\nportrait of Archbishop Cranmer in the National Portrait Gallery, and the\r\nsmall double portrait of the painter himself and his friend, Richard\r\nStrangeways. The three at Newbattle Abbey[738] are of great interest,\r\nthough it is impossible to describe them in detail here. The finest,\r\nwhich is dated 1547, and is signed “Gerlacius Fliccūs Germanūs\r\nfaciebat,” represents an unknown man of the age of forty, whom Miss\r\nHervey tentatively suggests to be William, Lord Grey of Wilton, clad in\r\na slit buff jerkin and a black velvet surcoat trimmed with fur. It is a\r\nportrait of considerable power, and though it has suffered from\r\nrepainting still appears to have been the work of a man of more than\r\nordinary artistic talents. The second portrait at Newbattle—of Sir Peter\r\nCarew—has many points in common with it, and was probably painted at\r\nabout the same time. The portrait of Archbishop Cranmer in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery is stiffer in style than these, and suggests a more\r\nobvious attempt to follow the manner of Holbein, but though very\r\ncarefully painted and with every appearance of truth of portraiture,\r\nlacks the vitality which stamps everything from the hand of the master.\r\nIt is signed “Gerbicus Flicciis Germanus faciebat,” and though undated\r\nwas, according to the sitter’s age, painted in 1545. The curious double\r\nportrait, on a small oak panel, of Flicke and his friend Strangeways or\r\nStrangwish, the gentleman privateer, known as the “Red Rover,” was\r\npainted in prison in 1554. The artist seems to have been mixed up in\r\nWyat’s rebellion, and as a result he and his friend were imprisoned, but\r\nafterwards released. Over each head is painted a verse, that above\r\nFlicke’s in Latin, which, translated, runs: “Such in appearance was\r\nGerlach Fliccius, what time he was a painter in the City of London. This\r\nportrait he painted from a mirror for his dear friends, that they might\r\nbe able to remember him after his death.” The lines over Strangeways are\r\nin English:\r\n\r\n             “Strangwish thus strangely depicted is,\r\n              One prisoner for thother hath done this;\r\n              Gerlin hath garnisht for his delight,\r\n              This woorck whiche you se before youre sight.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 736:\r\n\r\n  See Vol. i. p. 269.\r\n\r\nFootnote 737:\r\n\r\n  See _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xvii., May 1910, pp. 71-9, and June\r\n  1910, pp. 147-8, from which most of the following facts have been\r\n  taken; and J. G. Nichols, _Archæologia_, xxxix. pp. 40-41.\r\n\r\nFootnote 738:\r\n\r\n  All reproduced by Miss Hervey in _Burlington Magazine_, as quoted.\r\n\r\nThe background is blue. The present ownership of this picture is\r\nunknown. The remaining picture, at Newbattle Abbey, is a small portrait\r\nof Jacques de Savoie, duc de Nemours, showing the head and shoulders\r\nonly of a young man with fair hair and a very slight beard and\r\nmoustache, in French dress, and wearing the Order of St. Michael. It\r\nbetrays the influence of the French school, and is in style of marked\r\ndifference to his other known works. It was identified in 1909 by M.\r\nDimier, who discovered three crayon drawings taken from it, all of them\r\nbearing the title given above. The original picture is signed “G.\r\nFliccus ft.,” and on the back is an old label with “Origl. Fliccus ft.”\r\nMiss Hervey suggests that it was painted on the Continent about\r\n1555.[739]\r\n\r\nFootnote 739:\r\n\r\n  Reproduced by Miss Hervey, _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xvii., June\r\n  1910, p. 148, together with one of the French drawings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HANS EWORTHE OR EEUWOUTS]\r\n\r\nRecent researches on the part of Mr. Lionel Cust have established the\r\nidentity of another foreign painter of considerable skill, who was at\r\nwork in England some years after Holbein’s death, but who hitherto has\r\nbeen known only under the initials H. E.[740] This monogram occurs on a\r\nnumber of pictures of important personages bearing dates from 1550 to\r\n1568, the earliest of them being on a portrait at Longford Castle,\r\nformerly known as Sir Anthony Denny, but now recognised as Sir Thomas\r\nWyndham. These portraits have usually been given to Lucas d’Heere,[741]\r\nof Ghent, although all that is known of that painter’s life, including\r\nthe fact that he did not come to England before 1568, made the\r\nattribution of any one of them to him one of great difficulty. Mr. Cust,\r\nby means of certain entries in the Lumley inventory, has proved that the\r\nreal author of them was a certain Jan Eeuwouts, of Antwerp, whose name\r\nbecame anglicised into Haunce or Hans Eworthe. Three of the Lumley\r\nportraits are described as the work of Eworthe—“Mr. Edw. Shelley slayne\r\nat Mustleborough fielde, drawen by Haunce Eworthe”; “Haward a Dutch\r\nJuello^r, drawne for a Maisters prize by his brother, Haunce Eworthe”;\r\nand “Mary Duches of Northfolke, daughter to the last Earle of Arundell\r\nFitzallan, doone by Haunce Eworthe,” the last one being in all\r\nprobability the portrait now at Arundel Castle, which is signed H. E. in\r\nmonogram. Several other portraits in the Lumley inventory, though no\r\npainter’s name is given, still exist, and bear this monogram, such as\r\nthe small double portrait of Lord Darnley and his brother, Charles\r\nStewart, at Windsor Castle; Lord Maltravers at Arundel Castle; Sir John\r\nLutterel, dated 1550, at Dunster Castle; and Sir Thomas Wyndham, also\r\ndated 1550, at Longford Castle.[742] These portraits prove that Eworthe\r\nwas much employed by Lord Lumley or his father-in-law, the last Earl of\r\nArundel, at Nonsuch Palace. Mr. Cust has traced him as a resident alien\r\nin London in 1552 in the parish of St. Saviour’s, Southwark. He is\r\ndescribed in the return as “John Ewottes, paynter,” and assessed at the\r\nhigh rate of eight guineas, and he employed a servant named John\r\nMychell, who was assessed at eightpence. As “Jan Eeuwouts, schilder,” he\r\nwas admitted a free master of the Guild of St. Luke in Antwerp in 1540.\r\nIt is thus possible that he was a native of that city.[743]\r\n\r\nFootnote 740:\r\n\r\n  See _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xiv., pp. 366-8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 741:\r\n\r\n  For an account of d’Heere’s work in England, see Lionel Cust in _Dict.\r\n  of National Biography_, 1888, vol. xiv., in the _Magazine of Art_,\r\n  1891, and in the _Proceedings of the Huguenot Society of London_, vol.\r\n  vii.

The latter describes all the portraits which so\r\n  far can be attributed to Eworthe with any degree of certainty.\r\n\r\nThe present writer ventures to suggest that Eworthe was also the author\r\nof a picture included in the inventory of the Duke of Buckingham’s\r\npictures at York House in 1635. The entry is as follows: “Hans Evolls—A\r\nlittle head of Queen Mary.”[744] The spelling of most of the names in\r\nthis inventory is largely phonetic, and evidently the work of some\r\nperson with little knowledge of such matters, so that he may easily have\r\nturned Eworthe into Evolls.[745] The following statement of Walpole’s\r\nalso suggests a possible connection with Eworthe: “Another picture of\r\nEdward VI was in the collection of Charles I, painted by Hans Hueet, of\r\nwhom nothing else is known. It was sold for 20_l._ in the civil\r\nwar.”[746]\r\n\r\nFootnote 744:\r\n\r\n  See _Burlington Magazine_, vol. x., March 1907, p. 382.\r\n\r\nFootnote 745:\r\n\r\n  Or the double _l_ may be merely a mistake of the compiler of the\r\n  catalogue for a double _t_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 746:\r\n\r\n  Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed. Wornum, i. p. 136.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THOMAS AND JOHN BETTES]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to mention more than the names of certain better-known\r\nforeigners who practised in England under Mary and Elizabeth, such as\r\nMor, who came over in 1553, Joos van Cleve, who did so in 1554, and\r\nLucas d’Heere. Of the few known native painters working in London in the\r\nyears immediately following Holbein’s death the records are so scanty\r\nthat little remains but their names, but, taking them as a body, they\r\nmust have been men of very modest talent, and in portraiture, when they\r\nessayed it, merely feeble imitators either of Holbein or one of the\r\nother leading foreigners at Henry’s court. Among them were John Shute,\r\npainter and architect, and John Bettes, both of whom are described as\r\nminiature painters by Richard Haydock in his translation of _Lomazzo on\r\nPainting_ (1598), and, apparently, as contemporaries of Nicholas\r\nHilliard. “Limnings,” he says, “much used in former times in\r\nchurch-books, as also in drawing by the life in small models, of late\r\nyears by some of our countrymen, as _Shoote_, _Betts_, &c., but brought\r\nto the rare perfection we now see by the most ingenious, painful, and\r\nskilful master, Nicholas Hilliard.”[747] Meres, in _Palladis Tamia, Wits\r\nTreasury_, the second part of his _Wits Commonwealth_, also published in\r\n1598, in giving a list of the leading painters in England at that time,\r\nmentions “Thomas and John Bettes.” From these two entries it seems clear\r\nthat Bettes was an Elizabethan miniature painter, and Vertue, who was of\r\nopinion that he learned from Hilliard, mentions a miniature by him of\r\nHolbein’s sitter, Sir John Godsalve, in which he was represented with\r\nhis spear and shield, with the inscription “Captum in castris ad\r\nBoloniam 1540.”[748] There is, however, in the National Gallery a small\r\nportrait of Edmund Butts (No. 1496), a son of Sir William Butts, another\r\nof Holbein’s sitters, to which reference has been already made,[749]\r\nwhich is attributed to John Bettes, and bears the date 1545. If this\r\nattribution, based on a French inscription on the back of the panel, be\r\ncorrect, the date indicates that the painter was at work at a\r\nconsiderably earlier period than is to be inferred from the only two\r\nalmost contemporary references to him, quoted above, which have been so\r\nfar discovered, and that he may even have been personally acquainted\r\nwith Holbein. The portrait in the National Gallery is a work of\r\nconsiderable merit, and possesses certain Holbeinesque characteristics.\r\nIn any case, the date upon it makes it impossible, if painted by Bettes,\r\nthat he could have been Hilliard’s pupil, as Vertue asserted. Little or\r\nnothing is known of his work, though, according to Dr. Williamson, there\r\nis a fine miniature of an unknown man by him in the Montagu House\r\nCollection, signed “J. B. 1580”;[750] and a second, of a somewhat\r\nearlier date, a portrait of Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of France,\r\napparently unsigned, in Lord Beauchamp’s possession at Madresfield\r\nCourt.[751] Dr. Williamson also notes a quaint miniature of Edward VI as\r\na baby in the Rijks Museum, Amsterdam, which in an old inventory of the\r\nDutch royal possessions is attributed to Bettes.[752] Fox, in his\r\n_Ecclesiastical History_, states that John Bettes drew the vignettes for\r\nHall’s _Chronicle_. Still less is known of Thomas Bettes, but there was\r\na miniature in the Propert Collection of John Digby, Earl of Bristol,\r\nwhich was given to him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 747:\r\n\r\n  Quoted by Walpole, _Anecdotes_, ed.

Thus, in\r\n1543-4 he was at the head of a band of painters engaged on work in\r\nconnection with some revels at Hampton Court, for which he received\r\nhigher wages than the others—“Wages to painters: Nich^s Lezard 18_^d_\r\nper diem”; and in 1544-5 he supplied various materials and properties\r\nfor some other masque—“Paste work and painting, Nicholas Lizarde,\r\npainter, for gyldinge under garments for women, of white and blue\r\nsarcenet, with party gold and silver, 4 _li._; 8 pastes for women,\r\n20_d._; 8 long heads for women, made of past gilded, with party gold and\r\nsilver, 43_s._ 4_d._” &c. He was afterwards in the regular employment of\r\nthe Court throughout the reigns of Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth, being\r\nserjeant-painter to the last-named Queen, with a pension or salary of\r\n£10 a year. Nothing of his work remains that can be identified, but that\r\nhe painted “subject” pictures is to be gathered from a New Year’s gift\r\nhe presented to Queen Mary in 1556 of a “table painted with the Maundy,”\r\nwhile in 1558 his gift to Queen Elizabeth was “a table painted of the\r\nhistory of Assuerus,” for which he received a gilt cruse of some 8 oz.\r\nin weight. He died in April 1571, and at the time was living in the\r\nparish of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, and left a family of five sons and\r\nfour daughters.[754]\r\n\r\nFootnote 753:\r\n\r\n  “Foreign Artists in England,” &c., _Transactions Royal Inst. Brit.\r\n  Architects_, 1868, pp. 218 and 235. It may be suggested that this\r\n  painter was the “Master Nycolas” or “Nicholas Florentine” who worked\r\n  with Holbein on the decorations of the Greenwich Banqueting Hall in\r\n  1527; while a possible, though not very probable, connection between\r\n  Nicholas Lyzarde and Nicholas Lasora, who was engaged upon similar\r\n  work at Westminster Palace in 1532, has been already pointed out.\r\n  Lasora, however, in spite of his Italian-sounding name, appears to\r\n  have been a Teuton, for he may be identified with some probability as\r\n  the “Nic. Leysure, a German,” mentioned more than once in the royal\r\n  accounts. See vol. i. p. 314 and note.\r\n\r\nFootnote 754:\r\n\r\n  J. G. Nichols, _Archæologia_, vol. xxxix. p. 45. That he was not\r\n  English seems probable from the fact that he was assessed and taxed at\r\n  the customary rate for foreigners. See pp. 188-9.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS IMITATORS AND COPYISTS]\r\n\r\nIn the wider field of European art, also, it is impossible to point to\r\nany painter who was a pupil, or even a direct follower, of the master.\r\nSandrart says that Christopher Amberger “followed the famous artist\r\nHolbein in his manner of painting, and especially in portraiture,” but\r\nmodern criticism does not endorse this statement. In any case, his\r\nopportunities of studying Holbein’s works must have been few, though\r\nWoltmann considered that he certainly did so, and regarded him, if not\r\nas an actual pupil, yet as a real follower of the master.[755] It is not\r\nto be expected, indeed, that Holbein should have formed any definite\r\nschool, though he must have influenced painting in Basel during his\r\nfirst and longest residence in that city; but, except for that period,\r\nhis life was more or less a wandering one, and he never, during his\r\nshort career, settled for a long enough time in any one place to have\r\nallowed him to gather any considerable body of pupils around him.[756]\r\n\r\nFootnote 755:\r\n\r\n  Woltmann, i. p. 488.\r\n\r\nFootnote 756:\r\n\r\n  On this point, however, see Elsa Frölicher, _Die Porträtkunst Hans\r\n  Holbeins des Jüngeren und ihr Einfluss auf die schweizerische\r\n  Bildnismalerei im XVI Jahrhundert_, 1909, in which she traces the\r\n  influence of Holbein’s art on a number of contemporary Swiss painters\r\n  and others practising in the latter half of the sixteenth century,\r\n  such as Hans Asper, Tobias Stimmer, Kluber, Clauser, and Hans Bock the\r\n  Elder.\r\n\r\nThe work of his imitators and copyists, such as they were, is to be\r\nfound in the portraits scattered about the older country houses and\r\nmansions of England, where they are usually attributed to Holbein\r\nhimself, often when the date upon them makes it impossible that he could\r\nhave painted them. Among them are numerous old copies of still-existing\r\nportraits by him, which indicate the estimation in which his work was\r\nheld for years after his death. For instance, in the fire which burnt\r\ndown Knepp Castle, Sussex, in January 1904, a number of pictures were\r\ndestroyed, including no less than eight attributed to Holbein. The\r\ntitles of nearly all of them were familiar enough—Sir Henry and Lady\r\nGuldeford, Anne of Cleves, Thomas Cromwell, Sir Richard Rich, and\r\nÆgidius—indicating that they were most probably merely replicas or\r\ncopies. It is true that Holbein occasionally painted a replica, but this\r\nwas very rarely, and in most cases the portraits in question were the\r\nwork of far less skilful men, and owed their existence to the desire of\r\nthe descendants of Holbein’s original sitters to possess copies of the\r\nolder family portraits.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nHolbein’s many-sided art—The destruction of all his larger decorative\r\n  works—The fertility of his invention and his power of dramatic\r\n  composition—The influence of the Italian Renaissance upon his art,\r\n  both in his mural and historical paintings and in his designs for\r\n  jewellery and the decorative arts—His sacred paintings—His genius in\r\n  portraiture and his perfection as a draughtsman—A comparison between\r\n  the art of Dürer and Holbein.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLBEIN’S art was many-sided, but, through the cruel caprice of Fate, he\r\nis known to-day to most people merely as a great portrait-painter, and,\r\nin a lesser degree, as a designer of woodcut illustrations of remarkable\r\npower and imagination. It is true, of course, that during the latter\r\npart of his life, after he had settled more or less permanently in\r\nEngland, his time was almost entirely occupied with portraiture, and\r\nthat, beyond portraits, little or nothing of his work remains in this\r\ncountry upon which to form a judgment of the versatility of his genius;\r\nand it is true also that his stupendous gifts in this field of art were\r\nbound to find free expression. That portrait-painting, however, became\r\nin the end his chief occupation was due much more to his environment\r\nthan to his own personal choice. There was little demand in this country\r\nfor any other form of art, and the painter, as was only natural,\r\nsupplied what his patrons asked of him. It is not to be supposed that\r\nthe master who was capable of producing such great works as the “Meyer\r\nMadonna,” or the various altar-pieces and glass designs illustrating the\r\n“Passion,” would have abandoned painting such compositions had he\r\nreceived any encouragement to continue; but such encouragement came to a\r\nmore or less abrupt conclusion during the stormy days of the Reformation\r\nin Basel, and for the remainder of his life Holbein produced little or\r\nnothing in the field of sacred art. The few examples of this nature from\r\nhis brush which remain place him in the front rank of sixteenth-century\r\npainters, and had his birthplace been south instead of north of the\r\nAlps, and his life spent amid surroundings more sympathetic to this side\r\nof his genius, there can be little doubt that he would have given to the\r\nworld a series of sacred works as fine as those of any of the great\r\nItalians of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISAPPEARANCE OF DECORATIVE WORKS]\r\n\r\nIt is with respect to those larger decorative works, however, upon which\r\nhe was engaged from time to time throughout his life, both in\r\nSwitzerland and England—works for which in his own day he was so justly\r\ncelebrated—that Fate has treated him most unkindly. The total\r\ndisappearance of his great wall-paintings and monumental decorations is\r\nnot only an immense loss to art, but has rendered it difficult for all\r\nbut close students of his work to appreciate to the fullest extent the\r\nwide range of his artistic powers. Not a single example of his skill as\r\na mural decorator remains. The passage of time, the carelessness of\r\nthose whose duty it was to preserve them, and the ravages of fire and of\r\nthe weather, gradually obliterated these paintings, while such of their\r\nfaded glories as endured until more modern days were finally swept away\r\nby the clumsy hand of the restorer or the building schemes of private\r\nowners and civic authorities. Just as it seems practically certain that\r\nsome at least of his sacred pictures were destroyed by the fury of the\r\nrioters in the religious disturbances which finally drove Holbein to\r\nHenry’s court, so the mural paintings and pictured stories with which he\r\ncovered the outer and inner walls of a number of houses in Basel and\r\nLucerne have vanished through causes which, though different, have been\r\nequally effective in their powers of destruction. Damp, dirt, and\r\nneglect brought about the gradual fading away of his great series of\r\nwall-paintings in the Council Chamber of the Basel Town Hall; while\r\nsimilar works of his English period, the wonderful “Triumphs” painted\r\nfor the banquet-hall of the German Steelyard, and the great fresco of\r\nHenry VIII with his parents and Jane Seymour in Whitehall, have\r\ndisappeared, the former on the final breaking up of the German trade\r\nmonopoly in this country, and the dispersal of the contents of the\r\nSteelyard buildings, and the latter in the fire of 1698. Gone, too, is\r\nthe large canvas of “The Battle of Spurs,” painted for the festivities\r\nat Greenwich in 1527, one of the first of Holbein’s important\r\nundertakings in England. No trace of this painting now remains, and a\r\nsimilar fate has befallen the great picture of Sir Thomas More and his\r\nfamily, though in this case it is not absolutely certain that Holbein\r\nhimself ever completed it. Finally, death cut him down as he was engaged\r\nupon the most elaborate portrait group he ever undertook, which was not\r\nhalf finished when he fell a victim to the plague. This list of lost or\r\nruined masterpieces is a long one. Unfortunately, the tale is by no\r\nmeans uncommon in the history of art, but Holbein has suffered in this\r\nway more severely than most. Of their beauty and their imaginative power\r\nit is now only possible to judge from a few fragments of some of the\r\noriginal frescoes, some inferior copies of certain of them, and a number\r\nof masterly sketches and preliminary studies from Holbein’s own hand\r\npreserved in the Basel Gallery, the British Museum, the Louvre, and\r\nelsewhere. These latter, scanty as they are, remain priceless treasures,\r\nfor only by means of them is it possible to gain some idea, though it is\r\na pale reflection at the best, of the greatness of Holbein’s achievement\r\nin the higher branches of art, the loftiness of his ideals in his\r\nmonumental paintings, and the wide range of his genius.\r\n\r\nIn all these large decorative works Holbein displayed the greatest\r\nfertility of invention, and a power of dramatic composition of a very\r\nhigh order. The extraordinary energy of conception, the sense of life\r\nand movement in all his figures, the truth and expressiveness of their\r\ngestures, are all alike admirable. This dramatic power is at its finest\r\nin his wall-paintings for the Basel Town Hall—the “Rehoboam” and the\r\n“Samuel and Saul”; while in dignity and grandeur of composition, and the\r\nnoble rhythm of its stately movement, the “Triumph of Riches” panel for\r\nthe Steelyard is unsurpassed. The extraordinary fertility and exuberance\r\nof his imagination is to be seen in the architectural details and\r\ndecorative settings in which these mural paintings and designs were\r\nplaced. These settings show how quickly and completely he made the new\r\nideas and decorative motives of the Renaissance his own, while the\r\npictures themselves, for which they formed the background and the frame,\r\nbreathe the lofty spirit of Raphael and Mantegna. Though there is no\r\nslavish copying of the art and architecture of Northern Italy, their\r\ninfluence is to be seen so plainly in the work of his younger days that,\r\nas pointed out in earlier chapters, at least a short visit to Lombardy\r\non his part seems to have been absolutely certain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS FERTILE IMAGINATION]\r\n\r\nThe same qualities and the same influences are to be discerned in his\r\ndesigns for painted windows and the decoration of books; though smaller\r\nin scale, they are conceived with an equal grandeur and dramatic\r\nintensity. Indeed, in his “Dance of Death” woodcuts and illustrations to\r\nthe Old Testament his imaginative and dramatic powers reached their\r\nhighest manifestation. Minute as they are in execution, they produce the\r\nsame effects of largeness and dignity of composition as his great\r\nwall-paintings must have done. In the “Dance of Death” in particular the\r\nwideness of Holbein’s range of vision, the greatness of his style in\r\ndesign, and the intense vitality of his art are seen to the best\r\nadvantage. These little pictures, a few inches square, express within\r\ntheir borders almost the whole range of the emotions, from the tender\r\nsympathy of the lovely “Death and the Ploughman,” and the poignant grief\r\nof “Death and the Little Child,” down to the terror, horror, and\r\nviolence which is encountered in others of the series in which Death\r\nsuits his coming to the character of his victims. Such works as these\r\nshow the greatness of Holbein as an imaginative artist. Another side of\r\nhis nature and his art appears in such a design as his “Peasants’ Dance”\r\non the façade of the Haus zum Tanz in Basel, in which the Teutonic\r\nelement in his character finds full play. The boisterous, even brutal,\r\nmerriment of these fellow-countrymen of his, as they fling themselves\r\ninto the pleasures of the dance with the utmost abandon, made an\r\nundoubted appeal to him, and in depicting them he expressed the joy of\r\nliving which animates every movement with the utmost frankness and\r\nrealism.\r\n\r\nIn this wide field of mural decoration and historical painting Holbein\r\nwas the first and the greatest of those painters north of the Alps who\r\ncame under the influence of the Italian revival of art. In him the\r\nRenaissance found very complete expression. This is also to be seen in\r\nhis innumerable designs for jewellery and the smaller decorative arts,\r\nof which, happily, there still remain many examples. Both in book\r\nornamentations and illustrations, in work for the goldsmith and\r\nsilversmith, the jeweller, and the maker of stained and coloured glass,\r\nhe showed himself to be in closest sympathy with the new movement. In\r\nhis earlier works the effect of this influence appears in the exuberant\r\nuse he made of the models which he had recently studied, some of the\r\nglass designs being overloaded with fantastic reminiscences of the\r\ndetails of Lombardic architecture. Later on, when he had completely\r\ngrasped the full beauty of the Renaissance forms, his taste became\r\npurer, and he adapted them to his uses with the happiest results. In his\r\ndrawings for personal ornaments and jewellery, most of the best of which\r\nwere done in London, the earlier exuberance is restrained, and the\r\ndesign is of the purest Renaissance taste, in the practice of which he\r\nbecame an absolute master. These working drawings show infinite\r\ninvention kept within the true limitations of the materials to be used,\r\nfrequently combined with very skilful adaptation of the human figure to\r\ndecorative purposes. It would be difficult to find a more beautiful\r\ndesign in the Renaissance style than the one of the so-called Jane\r\nSeymour Cup, in which Holbein more than holds his own with the best\r\nItalian workers in this field.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRILLIANCE OF HIS DRAUGHTSMANSHIP]\r\n\r\nHis sacred paintings, in so far as can be judged from those which\r\nremain, most, if not all, of which were done before he had reached the\r\nage of thirty, possess similar qualities to those of his mural and\r\nhistorical works, and had he but received some little encouragement from\r\nthe English court, he was capable of producing even finer masterpieces\r\nthan the “Meyer Madonna” during the seventeen or eighteen remaining\r\nyears of his life. In his “Passion” and kindred pictures the composition\r\nis usually admirable, and the subject treated with that strong dramatic\r\nsense which has been noted already as one of the chief characteristics\r\nof his frescoes, while in depth and earnestness of feeling they fall but\r\nlittle short of the work of the greatest of the Italians. In the Meyer\r\nand the Solothurn Madonnas there is an air of divine tranquillity, and a\r\nloftiness and purity in the expression of spiritual beauty, which are\r\ncombined in the happiest and most exquisite way with remarkable truth to\r\nnature, and vividness of accurate and sympathetic portraiture in the\r\nfigures both of the Virgin and the Divine Child, and those, in the one\r\ncase, of the kneeling donor and his family, and, in the other, of the\r\nattendant saints. Added to these qualities, the rich, subdued, and\r\nharmonious colour gives a still greater truth and beauty to the whole.\r\nIn the panel at Darmstadt, indeed, the painter has reached the full\r\nperfection of his art, and that he painted nothing more of this nature\r\nmust always be a source of deep regret to all who admire him.\r\n\r\nIn portraiture Holbein’s genius reached its highest manifestations. This\r\ngift was largely inherited from his father, but was carried to a much\r\ngreater pitch of excellence by the son. His technical methods, too, were\r\nthose of his father, and here again were developed by him to a far\r\ngreater refinement of touch and skill in modelling; and to these methods\r\nhe remained constant throughout his life. There is a striking contrast\r\nbetween the rapidity and brilliance of the draughtsmanship of the\r\npreliminary studies for his portraits and the patient, concentrated,\r\nminute, and delicate brush-work of the finished portraits themselves. In\r\nall his completed work he spared himself no pains in the painting of the\r\naccessories and details, though in none of it, brilliant and absolutely\r\ntruthful as it is, is there any sense of mere display, any boastful\r\nattempt to show the world how clever he was. He painted all such details\r\nwith a loving care and an evident delight in their beauty, and wrought\r\nthem with a perfection and fidelity which has rarely if ever been\r\nsurpassed. This finish is carried in some of his pictures to a point\r\nbeyond which no Dutchman or Fleming of his own or succeeding generations\r\never reached. Yet the elaboration of subordinate things is never\r\noverdone; his portraits are never overcrowded with details of this\r\nnature in a way to draw the spectator’s attention from the main purpose\r\nof the work. This manipulative skill delights and attracts, but is\r\nforgotten when the portrait itself is examined. Without any apparent\r\neffort on the part of the painter, the sitter looks out from the panel\r\njust as he did in life, set down without flattery, with no harsh\r\nfeatures softened, and with his character, seized with such penetrative\r\nand imaginative power by Holbein, fixed for ever with unerring truth and\r\nerrorless draughtsmanship for succeeding generations to see and to\r\nadmire. This effect of absolute truth of portraiture and revelation of\r\ncharacter, the one due to the wonderful delicacy, subtlety, and\r\nexpressiveness of his line, and the other to his sympathetic insight, is\r\nobtained by what appear to be the simplest and most straightforward\r\nmethods. There is a dignity and reticence about the portraits which is\r\nadmirable. Without thought of self, he occupies himself entirely with\r\nthe truth as he sees it, and with his desire to realise it as completely\r\nas possible; no brilliance of technical skill mars the self-restraint\r\nwith which he approaches his sitter. He puts little of himself into his\r\nportraits, and leaves out little that is worth knowing about the\r\nsubjects of them. No great subtleties of light and shade are attempted,\r\nand his colour, beautiful and true as it is, helps but does not\r\noverpower his chief purpose—the complete realisation of the man both in\r\nbody and soul. Holbein was a painter whose keenness of observation was\r\nextraordinary; he missed little or nothing, and saw much that lesser\r\npainters would have ignored. With his smooth, fusing methods of painting\r\nhe reached to most marvellously delicate and accurate modelling of form,\r\nwhich in its expressiveness is beyond all words.[757]\r\n\r\nFootnote 757:\r\n\r\n  The writer finds it impossible to agree with a recent critic, M. de\r\n  Wyzewa, who, in a review of Dr. Ganz’s _Holbein_, in the _Revue des\r\n  Deux Mondes_, January 15, 1912, speaks of the “half-confidences” of\r\n  Holbein’s portraiture, and holds that although the painter himself\r\n  sees clearly the inmost depths of his sitters’ characters, he yet\r\n  refrains from revealing them to us. When the moment comes for laying\r\n  bare their deepest feelings “the prudent Swabian workman, through his\r\n  instinctive reserve, holds back.” In this respect, therefore, he\r\n  compares him unfavourably with such masters as Dürer, Rembrandt, and\r\n  Velazquez, “who abandon themselves to their genius for psychological\r\n  divination,” whereas Holbein refuses us access to the souls of his\r\n  sitters, though at the same time indicating that he himself has\r\n  penetrated to the mysterious depths. He speaks of this as his\r\n  “professional hypocrisy,” and says that he cannot be excused for thus\r\n  concealing the exact truth of the characters of the great personages\r\n  who sat to him. He sees similar traits in Holbein’s sacred paintings,\r\n  and this insensibility he regards as not real, but feigned, springing\r\n  from the intelligence rather than from the heart. Lovers of Holbein’s\r\n  art, however, will find it difficult to follow him in his contention.\r\n\r\nAs a draughtsman pure and simple he stands among the very highest; in\r\nsome of the qualities of his line he has never been surpassed or even\r\nequalled. In the Windsor and kindred drawings, preliminary studies for\r\nhis portraits, his genius finds its most perfect expression, and these\r\nare, in many ways, the greatest of his works. Slight as most of them\r\nare, they contain all the elements of great art. Every fine quality,\r\nexcept colour, that is to be found in his finished portraiture is to be\r\nfound here also, and more plainly to be seen, and produced without\r\napparent effort or hesitation. The swiftness yet sureness of his touch,\r\nthe wonderful delicacy yet strength of his supple, forceful line, its\r\nsubtlety and flexibility, the penetrative insight, the freedom from all\r\ntraces of mannerism, and the perfect unity of brain, eye, and hand shown\r\nin these drawings, combine to produce the most vivid effect of truthful,\r\nliving portraiture. His complete mastership is revealed in every touch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN AND DÜRER]\r\n\r\nIn the German school of painting Dürer was the last and the greatest of\r\nthe mediævalists; Holbein was the first and the greatest of those who\r\ncame completely under the sway of the new influences in art and life\r\nwhich reached Germany from beyond the Alps. The art of these two great\r\nmasters is, in consequence, in many ways so divergent that it is\r\ndifficult to make any comparison between them. Holbein was the first of\r\nthe painters of northern Europe who was modern in the sense of the term\r\nas we understand it to-day. Dürer was steeped in the spirit of the older\r\nschools, both of thought and of art, a dreamer of dreams, a weaver of\r\nfantasies, and much of his work had a spiritual passion which Holbein’s\r\nlacked, while his art was imbued through and through with the feeling of\r\nthe Middle Ages. On the other hand, one of the characteristic features\r\nof Holbein’s work was its serenity and saneness. As already pointed out,\r\nhe had great imaginative power, which he could use at times with\r\ndramatic intensity. Realism in his painting reached a very high and at\r\nthe same time a very noble development. His delight in nature is evident\r\nin all that he did; he observed her minutely, and took the utmost\r\npleasure in reproducing her manifold beauties down to the smallest\r\ndetails, while his work was filled with a frank delight in life and\r\nclose sympathy with all things, animate and inanimate, in the world\r\naround him. Philosophical thought or theological subtleties left him\r\nuntroubled. That he was on the side of the Reformation is made clear by\r\nmore than one of his woodcut designs, but his share in the controversy\r\nwas after all a minor one, and marked by little or none of that passion\r\nwhich swayed the more eager partisans on either side.\r\n\r\nTrue child of the Renaissance as Holbein was, he was yet one of the most\r\noriginal of artists. His strong individuality stamped everything that he\r\ntouched; for though the influences under which he was trained can be\r\ntraced throughout his career, they in no way dominated his genius, which\r\nfound its own true expression. Circumstances combined to give this\r\noriginality the fullest play. Both in Basel and in London there was no\r\nschool of painting worthy of the name, and the artists who worked there\r\nhad little or nothing to teach him. In both these cities it was he who\r\nwas the master who towered head and shoulders above his fellow-painters.\r\nIn this way his art developed upon personal and original lines until it\r\nattained that greatness of style which is so marked a feature of\r\neverything that he touched.\r\n\r\nThe art and character of these two great masters of the German school is\r\nvery happily contrasted by the late Lord Leighton in one of his\r\npublished addresses to the students of the Royal Academy. “Albert\r\nDürer,” he says, “may be regarded as _par excellence_ the typical German\r\nartist—far more so than his great contemporary, Holbein. He was a man of\r\na strong and upright nature, bent on pure and high ideals, a man ever\r\nseeking, if I may use his own characteristic expression, to make known\r\nthrough his work the mysterious treasure that was laid up in his heart;\r\nhe was a thinker, a theorist, and, as you know, a writer; like many of\r\nthe great artists of the Renaissance, he was steeped also in the love of\r\nScience. His work was in his own image; it was, like nearly all German\r\nArt, primarily ethic in its complexion; like all German Art it bore\r\ntraces of foreign influence—drawn, in his case, first from Flanders and\r\nlater from Italy. In his work, as in all German Art, the national\r\ncharacter asserted itself above every trammel of external influence.\r\nSuperbly inexhaustible as a designer, as a draughtsman he was powerful,\r\nthorough, and minute to a marvel, but never without a certain almost\r\ncaligraphic mannerism of hand, wanting in spontaneous simplicity—never\r\nbroadly serene. In his colour he was rich and vivid, not always unerring\r\nas to his harmonies, not alluring in his execution—withal a giant.... In\r\nHolbein we have a complete contrast to the great Franconian of whom I\r\nhave just spoken; a man not prone to theorise, not steeped in\r\nspeculation, a dreamer of no dreams; without passion, but full of joyous\r\nfancies, he looked out with serene eyes upon the world around him;\r\naccepting Nature without preoccupation or afterthought, but with a keen\r\nsense of all her subtle beauties, loving her simply and for herself. As\r\na draughtsman he displayed a flow, a fullness of form, and an almost\r\nclassic restraint which are wanting in the work of Dürer, and are,\r\nindeed, not found elsewhere in German Art. As a colourist, he had a keen\r\nsense of the values of tone relations, a sense in which Dürer again was\r\nlacking; not so Teutonic in every way as the Nuremberg master, he formed\r\na link between the Italian and the German races. A less powerful\r\npersonality than Dürer, he was a far superior painter. Proud may that\r\ncountry be indeed that counts two names so great in art.”[758]\r\n\r\nFootnote 758:\r\n\r\n  Leighton, _Addresses delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy_,\r\n  2nd edition, 1897, pp. 305-6. (Dec. 9, 1893.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RUSKIN ON HOLBEIN]\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that he was a better painter than Dürer, for his\r\nmastery of the technical side of his art was complete, while his\r\nartistic temperament found expression in many different branches of the\r\ndecorative arts and crafts. He was thus much more than a great painter:\r\nhe was a great artist and a great craftsman as well, for though he did\r\nnot actually cut the wood blocks he designed, or fashion the actual cups\r\nof gold and silver for which he made the working drawings, he had so\r\nperfect a knowledge of the practical side of the crafts, and of the\r\nartistic capabilities and the limitations of the mediums in which his\r\ndesigns were to be carried out, that he was indeed the “notable workman”\r\nwhich Erasmus called him. In all that he did, the greatness and the\r\nindividuality of his style, his power of dramatic composition, the\r\nversatility of his imagination and his restraint in the use of it, his\r\nserene outlook upon life, and the perfect and unerring unison of his eye\r\nand hand, combine with his insight into character and technical skill of\r\nthe rarest quality to make him one of the few great masters of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nRuskin’s judgment of him, when comparing him with Sir Joshua Reynolds,\r\nis so true and so just, that, although so well-known, a sentence from it\r\nmay be quoted here in conclusion. “The work of Holbein,” he says, “is\r\ntrue and thorough, accomplished in the highest, as the most literal\r\nsense, with a calm entireness of unaffected resolution which sacrifices\r\nnothing, forgets nothing, and fears nothing. Holbein is complete; what\r\nhe sees, he sees with his whole soul; what he paints, he paints with his\r\nwhole might.”[759]\r\n\r\nFootnote 759:\r\n\r\n  Ruskin, “Sir Joshua and Holbein,” in _Cornhill Magazine_, March 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) EARLY DRAWING BY HOLBEIN IN THE MAXIMILIANS MUSEUM, AUGSBURG. (Vol.\r\n                               i. p. 43)\r\n\r\nTHE drawing of “Calvary” in the Maximilians Museum, Augsburg (Woltmann,\r\n3), is probably the earliest one by Holbein of which we have any\r\nknowledge. It is a silver-point drawing, touched with the brush in\r\nbrown, white being used for the high lights and red for the\r\nrepresentation of Christ’s wounds. It is a carefully wrought, youthful\r\npiece of work, at the same time showing considerable feeling in its\r\nrendering of the sacred subject. The Cross rises on the left, turned\r\naway from the spectator, so that the body of Christ is seen almost in\r\nprofile against the sky. Mary and John stand below on the right, the\r\nformer with hands clasped in prayer and head bent in grief. Lower down\r\nthe rock, in the centre, kneels Mary Magdalen with uplifted arms, and on\r\nthe left of the Cross a man is standing with his back to the spectator,\r\nwearing a tall hat of “beaver” pattern. In the background beyond him is\r\na second cross with one of the thieves, the ladder still placed against\r\nit. Down below the heights there is a glimpse of a mountain and\r\nbuildings. This interesting early example has been recently reproduced\r\nin the important publication of facsimiles of the complete series of\r\nHolbein’s drawings, now in the course of appearing under the editorship\r\nof Dr. Ganz—_Die Handzeichnungen Hans Holbeins des Jüngeren_, viii. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (B) DESIGNS FOR PAINTED GLASS OF THE LUCERNE PERIOD. (Vol. i. p. 79)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EARLY GLASS DESIGNS]\r\n\r\nThe design for painted glass with the arms of Hans Fleckenstein, of\r\nLucerne, in the Ducal Gallery, Brunswick (not in Woltmann), is the\r\nearliest in date of the series of designs for this purpose in which\r\nHolbein made such fine decorative use of the landsknechte with their\r\npicturesque costumes as supporters of the shield bearing the coat of\r\narms of the patron for whom the glass was ordered. In the Fleckenstein\r\ndesign the warrior on the left is bearded, and wears a hat with very\r\nlarge feathers, and a great sword, while a long lance is held aloft in\r\nhis right hand, his left resting on the top of the shield, towards which\r\nhe leans, and behind which his left leg is hidden. The man on the right\r\nis younger and beardless. His head is turned over his shoulder towards\r\nthe right, and his flat black cap is worn jauntily over one ear and\r\ncovers one side of his face, while a large hat with a huge mass of\r\nfeathers is slung upon his back. His right hand rests on his sword-hilt,\r\nand his left on the top of the shield. The background is one of plain\r\narchitecture, in striking contrast to the highly elaborated ones to be\r\nseen in most of Holbein’s glass designs produced after his visit to\r\nItaly. A barrel-roof is supported by flat columns with a round arch,\r\nacross which two iron bars run, as in the Solothurn Madonna picture. On\r\neither side of this arch, on the top of the columns, stand figures of\r\nSt. Barbara and St. Sebastian. The shield contains in two of the\r\nquarterings the Fleckenstein “house-sign” surmounted by a bar, the other\r\ntwo being filled with lozenge-shaped divisions. On the band at the\r\nbottom, left empty for an inscription, is written “hans Fleckenstein,\r\n1517,” and “J. Holbain,” the signature not being in the artist’s own\r\nhandwriting. It is reproduced by Dr. Ganz in _Die Handzeichnungen Hans\r\nHolbeins des Jüngeren_, v. 4.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the landscape backgrounds in several of Holbein’s glass\r\ndesigns afford evidence of a journey across the Alps has been touched\r\nupon in the text (see vol. i. p. 77), and further proof of this is to be\r\nfound in another design of this period, made, in all probability, during\r\na leisurely journey from Lucerne to Lombardy in 1518. This is the\r\nstriking design representing the Banner-bearer of the Urseren Valley, in\r\nthe Uri district—the valley watered by the Reuss, in which Andermatt is\r\nthe chief village. This drawing, which is in the Royal Print Room,\r\nBerlin, is mentioned by Woltmann, ii. p. 120, as, in his opinion, not by\r\nHolbein, but by some “good Swiss master.” The landsknecht, a bearded\r\nman, stands full-face, with legs stretched wide apart, and the banner\r\nheld aloft in his right hand. His left rests on his hip, and he carries\r\na great sword. This animated, vigorously drawn figure is evidently a\r\nportrait. The banner, an important part of the design, bears on the left\r\nthe figure of a bishop with crozier in the act of benediction, and on\r\nthe right a church, with the bull of Uri in the sky above it, one hoof\r\nresting on the steeple. In the background is represented the old\r\npack-horse road over the St. Gotthard, up which men are climbing with\r\nhorses and mules loaded with barrels and bales. On the summit rises the\r\nsmall church which is depicted on the banner. The landscape is evidently\r\none actually seen by the artist. The setting is a very effective one,\r\nconsisting of plain pillars and an arch, the former with vine branches\r\nand bunches of grapes trained round them in spirals, the leaves forming\r\nthe capitals and bases, while other branches stretch across the archway.\r\nAbove the latter is a representation of the Judgment of Paris, with the\r\nthree nude goddesses on the right, and Paris reclining on the ground on\r\nthe left. Mercury, holding the apple, and Venus, the outer figures of\r\nthis group, are placed upon the tops of the pillars on either side. The\r\noutlines have been put in with a pen in brown, while the banner-bearer’s\r\nface has been finished in water-colours, and the background slightly\r\nwashed with green. Reproduced in _Handzeichnungen Hans Holbeins des\r\nJüngeren_, iv. 4.\r\n\r\nThe glass design containing the coat of arms of the Lachner family, of\r\nBasel, in the Print Room of the National Museum, Stockholm (not in\r\nWoltmann), is a year or two later in date, the elaborately imagined\r\narchitectural background indicating that it must have been made shortly\r\nafter Holbein’s return from Italy, when the recollections of the\r\nLombardic buildings he had studied with such keen interest were still\r\nfresh in his memory. On one side stands a young, beardless warrior as\r\nshield-bearer, his face in profile to the right, his lance over his\r\nshoulder, and his right hand on his hip. Opposite to him is the\r\ncompletely nude figure of a woman, her face turned towards the\r\nspectator, and both hands resting on the shield. Her hair hangs down her\r\nback in two great plaits, which are fastened together at the ends with a\r\nlong loop. This is a realistic study from the life, and one of the very\r\nfew drawings of the nude by Holbein which remain. The coat of arms on\r\nthe curved Italian shield consists of a pair of outstretched wings, and\r\nthese are repeated on the helmet which forms the crest, from which\r\nmasses of finely designed scroll-work fall on either side. The two\r\nfigures stand on a platform, below which are two crouching fauns holding\r\na tablet for an inscription. The background, as already stated, is very\r\nelaborate, consisting of an open loggia with a roof like the later “St.\r\nElizabeth” glass design (see vol. i. p. 149 and Pl. 44), and friezes and\r\na semicircular arch supported by pairs of columns with grotesque\r\ncapitals, the arch being decorated with a band of ox-heads and foliage.\r\nOther friezes are covered with carved leaf and scroll-work, and above\r\nthem are grotesque sculptured figures and roundels with heads. Through\r\nthe openings at the back only the sky is indicated. This is a fine\r\ndesign, more particularly in the figure of the man, and in the helmet\r\nwith its scroll-work. It is a washed drawing, with the knight’s face and\r\nhands and the body of the woman put in with water-colour. Reproduced in\r\n_Handzeichnungen Hans Holbeins des Jüngeren_, iv. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n        (C) EARLY DRAWINGS FOR WALL-PAINTINGS. (Vol. i. p. 101)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the studies for wall-paintings made by Holbein shortly\r\nafter his return from Lucerne to Basel, described in vol. i. pp. 98-101,\r\nthere is another in the Ducal Gallery, Brunswick (Woltmann, 127),\r\nrepresenting the Virgin Mary, as Queen of Heaven, with the Infant Christ\r\nin her arms, which is signed and dated “1520, H. H.” Her long hair falls\r\nin curls over her shoulders, and a plain circular halo is placed behind\r\nher crown. She is looking down upon the Child, whom she holds with both\r\nhands, and he is smiling back at her. She is placed in a perfectly plain\r\narchitectural niche, with two empty circles for medallions on either\r\nside. According to an inscription on the back, this drawing, which is in\r\nblack chalk washed with grey, was, towards the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, in the possession of Daniel Lindtmeyer, the glass painter of\r\nSchaffhausen. Reproduced in _Handzeichnungen Hans Holbeins des\r\nJüngeren,_ iv. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n(D) GLASS DESIGNS WITH THE COATS OF ARMS OF THE VON ANDLAU AND VON HEWEN\r\n                       FAMILIES. (Vol. i. p. 145)\r\n\r\nA third design for painted glass, representing the martyrdom of the Holy\r\nRichardis, wife of the Emperor Carl the Big, is of about the same date,\r\nand very probably belongs to the same series, as the two designs bearing\r\nthe coats of arms of the Von Andlau and Von Hewen families, the second\r\nof which is dated 1520. St. Richardis, wrongfully accused of\r\nunfaithfulness, proved her innocence by submitting herself to the ordeal\r\nby fire. She was the patron saint of the convent of Andlau in Alsace,\r\nwhich, according to the legend quoted by Dr. Paul Ganz, was erected upon\r\nground which had been scraped up by a bear. It is most probable,\r\ntherefore, that Holbein’s design was commissioned for the decoration of\r\nthis particular religious house. The drawing, which is in the Basel\r\nGallery (Woltmann, 50), shows the saint kneeling on the funeral pyre,\r\nher hands clasped in prayer, her head bent, and her long curls falling\r\nbelow her waist. She wears a large cross at her breast, and has a\r\ncircular halo inscribed “S. RIGARDIS VIRGO.” On the right is a small\r\nkneeling figure of an abbess or nun, with open prayer-book, and on the\r\nleft the bear of the legend. Two flying angels, with draperies very\r\neffectively arranged, hold the martyr’s crown above her head. The ordeal\r\ntakes place beneath a cupola, with an opening in the centre, supported\r\nby pillars of fantastic design, the bases of the nearer ones being\r\ndecorated with medallions hanging from chains. Below is the customary\r\nblank tablet for an inscription, held by two grotesque sea-monsters with\r\nhuman heads. At the back, seen through the open arcading of the\r\nbuilding, there is a view of a small walled town in a hilly country,\r\nwith church and cloisters and watch-towers, and, lower down, the red\r\nroofs of a cluster of houses. This is one of the most charming of the\r\nnumerous landscape backgrounds which Holbein introduced into his glass\r\ndesigns and book illustrations. The drawing is washed with grey, and the\r\nbackground lightly touched in with water-colours. It is reproduced in\r\n_Handzeichnungen Hans Holbeins des Jüngeren_, xi. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE GLASS DESIGNS OF “THE PASSION OF CHRIST”\r\n                            (Vol. i. p. 156)\r\n\r\nMiss Mary F. S. Hervey, in her _Holbein’s Ambassadors_ (p. 22, _note_),\r\ndraws attention to some cartoons for tapestry representing scenes from\r\nthe Passion designed by Holbein. The reference occurs in a letter from\r\nCarlos de la Traverse, written from St. Ildefonse in Spain in 1779 to M.\r\nd’Angeviller, in which he proposes that the latter should buy the\r\ncartoons. The offer, however, was declined on the ground that Holbein\r\nwas “un peintre sec et demi-gothique” (See _Nouvelles Archives de l’Art\r\nFrançais_, 2nd series, vol. i. pp. 258-62). It is possible that these\r\ndesigns were not for tapestry but for glass, and they may even have been\r\nthe set in Sir Thomas Lawrence’s collection, now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (E) THE FAESCH MUSEUM. (Vol. i. pp. 88, 166-8, 180, and 239-41)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FAESCH MUSEUM]\r\n\r\nAmong the miscellaneous contents of the Faesch Museum, formed by Dr.\r\nRemigius Faesch, or Fäsch, the most important are the few works by and\r\nafter Holbein. Most of these came to him by inheritance from his\r\ngrandfather, the earlier Remigius Faesch, burgomaster of Basel, who\r\nmarried Rosa Irmi, the granddaughter of Jakob Meyer zum Hasen, and so\r\nbecame possessed, not only of the double portrait of Meyer and his wife,\r\nDorothea Kannengiesser, painted in 1516, and the two fine silver-point\r\nstudies for the same, but also the famous Meyer Madonna now at\r\nDarmstadt. This last picture, unfortunately for the Basel Public Picture\r\nCollection, he sold to Lucas Iselin in 1606. Dr. Faesch’s father, Johann\r\nRudolf Faesch (1574-1660), also burgomaster of Basel, became in turn the\r\nowner of the Meyer portraits and drawings, and he added a number of\r\nother pictures to the collection. He was acquainted with the painter\r\nBartholomäus Sarburgh, who from 1620 to 1628 was busily occupied in\r\npainting portraits in Basel, and to whom, in 1621, he gave a commission\r\nfor a likeness of his son Remigius, an excellent work now in the Basel\r\nGallery. (Reproduced by Dr. Emil Major in the sixtieth annual report of\r\nthe Basel Picture Collection, 1908.) From Sarburgh, when that painter\r\nwas in Holland, Johann Rudolf Faesch obtained the copies of Holbein’s\r\nseries of Prophets, nine pairs (see vol. i. p. 88). The originals were\r\nin water-colour, but were copied by Sarburgh in oil. He is said to have\r\ntaken the originals with him to the Netherlands, since which time all\r\ntraces of them have disappeared. These copies are in the depot of the\r\nBasel Gallery; two of the pairs are reproduced by Dr. Ganz in _Holbein_,\r\np. 191.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FAESCH MUSEUM]\r\n\r\nRemigius Faesch the second (1595-1667) became a doctor of law and a\r\nprofessor in the Basel University. He was an ardent collector throughout\r\nhis life, not only of pictures, but of books, medals, examples of\r\ngoldsmiths’ art, and antiquities. On the death of his father he became\r\nthe possessor of the Meyer portraits and the Sarburgh “Prophets.” To\r\nthese he added a small square portrait of Erasmus of the Holbein school,\r\nand in 1630, Johannes Lüdin, a pupil of Sarburgh, then in Belgium,\r\ncopied for him the heads of Jakob Meyer’s son and daughter from the\r\nMeyer Madonna picture; apparently not from the original, but from the\r\ncopy now in the Dresden Gallery, which, according to Dr. Major, was most\r\nprobably the work of Sarburgh (see vol. i. pp. 239-41). In 1648 Johann\r\nSixt Ringlin copied for him one of the versions of the double portrait\r\nof Erasmus and Froben (see vol. i. pp. 166-8). Again, in 1667, the year\r\nof Faesch’s death, Lüdin presented him with a small portrait of Holbein\r\nwhich he had painted from Hollar’s etching dated 1641. Faesch also\r\npossessed a second small portrait of Erasmus, copied from the roundel in\r\nthe Basel Gallery, several drawings of the Holbein school, and, among\r\nother things, the original wood-block of the “Erasmus im Gehäuse.” On\r\nhis death Faesch left his collections and the mansion containing them in\r\ntrust as a Museum, with usufruct to his descendants for so long as there\r\nshould be a doctor of law among the members of his family, failing which\r\neverything was to become the property of the Basel University. The last\r\nof these doctors of law was Johann Rudolf Faesch, who died in 1823, when\r\nthe Museum and its contents were handed over to the University, the\r\npictures, drawings, and engravings eventually finding a permanent home\r\nin the Basel Public Picture Collection.\r\n\r\nDr. Remigius Faesch spent many years in the compilation of a manuscript,\r\nin Latin, now in the University Library of Basel, which he called\r\n“Humanæ Industriæ Monumenta.” One section of this deals briefly with the\r\nlife of Holbein and with his chief works then in Basel in the Amerbach\r\nCabinet and Faesch’s own possession, to which reference has been made\r\nmore than once in these pages. The original text is given by Woltmann,\r\nii. pp. 48-51, and extracts from it in _Das Fäschische Museum und die\r\nFäschischen Inventare_, by Dr. Emil Major, which forms part of the\r\nAnnual Report (1908) of the Basel Gallery, already mentioned. It is from\r\nthis exhaustive and highly interesting account of the Faesch collections\r\nand the various inventories and lists, printed in full, that the facts\r\nin this note have been taken.\r\n\r\nThe reference to the double portrait of Erasmus and Froben in the\r\n“_Humanæ Industriæ Monumenta_” is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Erant 2 tabulæ junctæ, ligamentis ferreis ut aperiri et claudi\r\n    potuerint, in tabula dextra Effigies Johan. Frobenii Typographi,\r\n    in altera Erasmi sine dubio ab ipso Erasmo in gratiam et honorem\r\n    Frobenii, quem impense amabat, curatæ, et eidem ab Erasmo\r\n    oblatæ, unde et eidem dextram cessit: Ex his tabulis nobis\r\n    exempla paravit pictor non imperitus Joh. Sixtus Ringlinus\r\n    Basil, An. 1648, quæ extant inter effigies nostras.”\r\n\r\nFaesch’s account of the sale of the Meyer Madonna runs thus:—\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FAESCH MUSEUM]\r\n\r\n    “An. 163 . . . suprad. pictor Le Blond hic à vidua et hæredibus\r\n    Lucæ Iselii ad S. Martinum emit tabulam ligneam trium circiter\r\n    ulnarum Basiliensium tum in altitud. tum longitud. in qua\r\n    adumbratus prædictus Jac. Meierus Consul ex latere dextra una\r\n    cum filiis, ex opposito uxor cum filiabus omnes ad vivum depicti\r\n    ad altare procumbentes, unde habeo exempla filii et filiæ in\r\n    Belgio à Joh. Ludi pictore ex ipsa tabula depicta. Solvit is Le\r\n    Blond pro hac tabula 1000 Imperiales, et postea triplo majoris\r\n    vendidit Mariæ Mediceæ Reginæ Galliæ viduæ Regis Lud. 13 matri,\r\n    dum in Belgio ageret, ubi et mortua: Quorsum postea pervenerit\r\n    incertum. Tabula hæc fuit Avi nostri Remigii Feschii Consulis,\r\n    unde Lucas Iselius eam impetravit pro Legato Regis Galliarum,\r\n    uti ferebat, et persolvit pro ea Centum Coronatos aureos\r\n    solares. An. circ. 1606.”\r\n\r\nIn this paragraph Faesch speaks of Johannes Lüdin as Ludi, but in an\r\nearlier one, describing the portrait of Holbein after Hollar which Lüdin\r\nsent him, apparently as a new year’s gift, he calls the painter Joh.\r\nLydio.\r\n\r\nIn an inventory drawn up early in the nineteenth century by the last\r\nkeeper of the Museum, Johann Rudolf Faesch, the Sarburgh “Prophets” are\r\ndescribed as follows:\r\n\r\n    “13 a 21. Ferners befinden sich in dem Faeschischen Museo noch\r\n    hienach-folgende Neun Gemählde auf Tuch, welche von Bartholomäus\r\n    von Saarbrücken nach Holbeinischen Original Gemählden copirt\r\n    worden sind, solche werden von Patin in dem Eingangs gemeldten\r\n    Indice also beschrieben:\r\n\r\n    “‘Prophetæ omnes majores & minores, in novem tabulis\r\n    bicubitalibus, ita ut binos quævis illarum exhibeat, coloribus\r\n    aqueis nullo admixto oleo depicti.

(Vol. i. p. 175)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN AND DR. J. FABRI]\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that Holbein’s absences from Basel in search of work\r\nduring his second sojourn in that city (1519-1526) were more frequent\r\nthan has been generally supposed. It is not to be expected that many\r\nrecords of such journeys should remain, and for this reason the recent\r\ndiscovery, by Dr. Hans Koegler, of such an absence during 1523 is of\r\nexceptional interest. His article, describing this discovery, entitled\r\n“Hans Holbein d. J. und Dr. Johann Fabri,” was published by him in\r\n_Repertorium für Kunstwissenschaft_, vol. xxxv. pts. 4 and 5, (1912),\r\npp. 379-84. Fabri was Vicar-General of Constance, and afterwards Bishop\r\nof Vienna, and a friend and correspondent of Erasmus. During the autumn\r\nof 1523, at some place not yet identified, but evidently in the\r\nneighbourhood of Constance, Holbein and Dr. Fabri became acquainted, or\r\nrenewed an earlier intercourse, for the Vicar-General made use of him as\r\nthe bearer of some letter, message of greeting, or gift to Erasmus, and\r\nfrom the latter’s reply in acknowledgment it is to be gathered that the\r\nrelationships between the painter and the author of _The Praise of\r\nFolly_ were very friendly ones. The letter from Erasmus to Fabri,\r\nwritten in November or December 1523, begins:\r\n\r\n    “Reverendo Domino, Joanni Fabro, Canonico et Vicario\r\n    Constantien. domino plurimum observando.—Salutem, vir\r\n    amantissime, ex tua salutatione quam mihi per Olpeium misisti,\r\n    melius habui. Erat enim accurata, et veniebat ab amico, et per\r\n    hominem amicum. Spongiarum rursus tria milia sunt excusa, sic\r\n    visum est Frobenio...,” &c.\r\n\r\nIn this letter Fabri’s messenger is spoken of as “Olpeius,” and the\r\npoint for decision is whether this refers to Hans Holbein, or to a\r\nsecond Olpeius occasionally mentioned in the correspondence of\r\nErasmus—one Severinus Olpeius, who acted as letter-carrier for Erasmus\r\nmore than once, and appears to have been in the employ of the bookseller\r\nKoberger of Nuremberg. In one or two of the letters of Erasmus the name\r\n“Olpeius” is undoubtedly intended for Holbein, as in the one conveying\r\nhis thanks to Sir Thomas More for the drawing of the Family Group which\r\nMore had sent to him by the hands of the painter. In this letter, which\r\nis dated from Freiburg, September 1529 (see vol. i. p. 341), Erasmus\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    “Utinam liceat adhuc semel in vita videre amicos mihi\r\n    charissimos, quos in pictura quam Olpeius exhibuit, utcunque\r\n    conspexi summa cum animi mei voluptate. Bene vale cum tibi\r\n    charissimis omnibus.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN AND DR. J. FABRI]\r\n\r\nAgain, in a second letter from Erasmus to Bonifacius Amerbach written\r\nfrom Freiburg on April 10, 1533 (wrongly dated 1535 in the manuscript),\r\nfirst published by Dr. C. Chr. Bernoulli in 1902 (see below, Appendix\r\n(J)), the “Olpeius” of whom the sage speaks so severely was almost\r\ncertainly Holbein. Dr. Koegler brings forward convincing arguments to\r\nprove that the artist was also the “Olpeius” of the letter to Dr. Fabri,\r\nand that the place of encounter was somewhere in the Lake of Constance\r\ndistrict. He also suggests that as Dr. Fabri was connected in his\r\nofficial capacity with the Maria-Wallfahrts Church in Rickenbach, for\r\nwhich Holbein’s earliest known picture, the Virgin and Child of 1514,\r\nwas painted, and as he was also the personal friend of the orderer of\r\nthat little work, Canon Johann von Botzheim of Constance, he must have\r\nbeen already acquainted with Holbein. In any case, it seems certain\r\nthat, thanks to Dr. Kœgler, we have here definite, though scanty,\r\ninformation of one more of the painter’s wanderings in search of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n         (G) THE TRADE-MARK OF REINHOLD WOLFE. (Vol. i. p. 202)\r\n\r\nThe charming device of boys throwing sticks at an apple tree, which\r\nHolbein made for the publisher Reinhold Wolfe, seems to have been\r\nfamiliar to most English schoolboys in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies, as it was to be found in a Latin Grammar much in use. There\r\nis an amusing reference to it in Henry Peacham’s _Compleat Gentleman_\r\n(reprint of the 1634 edition, Clarendon Press, 1906, pp. 126-7). He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    “Painting is a quality I love (I confesse) and admire in others,\r\n    because ever naturally from a child, I have beene addicted to\r\n    the practice hereof: yet when I was young I have beene cruelly\r\n    beaten by ill and ignorant Schoolemasters, when I have been\r\n    taking, in white and blacke, the countenance of some one or\r\n    other (which I could doe at thirteene and foureteene yeeres of\r\n    age: beside the Mappe of any Towne according to Geometricall\r\n    proportion, as I did of _Cambridge_ when I was of _Trinity\r\n    Colledge_, and a Junior Sophister), yet could they never beate\r\n    it out of me. I remember one Master I had (and yet living not\r\n    farre from _S. Albanes_) tooke me one time drawing out with my\r\n    penne that peare-tree and boyes throwing at it, at the end of\r\n    the Latine Grammar: which hee perceiving, in a rage strooke me\r\n    with the great end of the rodde, and rent my paper, swearing it\r\n    was the onely way to teach me to robbe Orchards; beside, that I\r\n    was placed with him to be made a Scholler and not a Painter,\r\n    which I was very likely to doe; when I well remember he\r\n    construed me the beginning of the first _Ode_ in _Horace_,\r\n    _Edite_, set ye forth, _Maecenas_, the sports, _atavis Regibus_,\r\n    of our ancient Kings: but leaving my ingenious Master, to our\r\n    purpose.”\r\n\r\n\r\n           (H) NICOLAS BELLIN OF MODENA.

(Vol. i. pp. 291-302)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MORE FAMILY GROUP]\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting manuscript book, dated 1859, in the\r\npossession of Lord St. Oswald, which contains a descriptive catalogue of\r\nthe pictures at Nostell Priory, together with “Some brief Notices of the\r\nsundry pictures of the Family of Sir Thomas More, Knt., Lord High\r\nChancellor of England, Temp. Henry VIII,” from which, through the\r\ncourtesy of the owner, the writer is enabled to give some extracts. It\r\nwas written by Lord St. Oswald’s grandfather, Mr. Charles Winn, whose\r\nchief purpose seems to have been to controvert Horace Walpole’s adverse\r\ncriticism, based on George Vertue’s manuscript notes, of the Nostell\r\npicture. Mr. Winn gives a short history and description of the various\r\nversions of the Family Group. Speaking of the Nostel Priory version,\r\ncalled throughout his notes the “Roper” picture, he says:\r\n\r\n    “This picture formerly belonged to William Roper, Esqre., son of\r\n    William Roper, Esqre., Prothonotary of the Court of King’s\r\n    Bench, temp. Henry VIII, who married Margaret, the oldest, and\r\n    favourite daughter of the celebrated Sir Thos. More, Knt., Lord\r\n    High Chancellor of England; and was painted for him by that\r\n    renowned artist Hans Holbein in the year 1530, as appears from\r\n    the monogram and date on the picture. It remained in this family\r\n    till the death of Edwd. Roper, the last in the direct male line\r\n    of the Ropers of Well Hall, nr. Eltham, Co. of Kent, and of St.\r\n    Dunstans, nr. Canterbury; he had only one child, a daughter, who\r\n    married Charles Henshaw, Esqre., who on her father’s death\r\n    inherited all his property. The issue of this marriage was three\r\n    daughters, the eldest of whom married Sir Edward Dering, Bart.,\r\n    of Surrenden Dering in the County of Kent; the second married\r\n    Col. Strickland of Beverly, in the East Riding of the Co. of\r\n    York; and the third, Susannah, married my great-grandfather, Sir\r\n    Roland Winn, Bart., of Nostel, in the West Riding of the Co. of\r\n    York. Mrs. Strickland died without leaving issue, and on the\r\n    death of Mr. Henshaw, his two surviving daughters succeeded to\r\n    his real, as well as personal property. The Holbein picture was\r\n    valued at £3000, and Sir Edward Dering preferring to have his\r\n    share in money, my ancestor paid him a moiety of the valuation,\r\n    and thus became possessed of the picture, which was conveyed to\r\n    Nostel, where it still remains.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MORE FAMILY GROUP]\r\n\r\nMr. Winn was of opinion that the version, with life-size figures,\r\npainted in distemper, which belonged to Andries de Loo, was not the\r\npicture at Nostell, the latter being painted in oil. He considered that\r\nthe De Loo version was the one formerly at Heron in Essex (afterwards at\r\nThorndon—see vol. i. p. 300), and that it was purchased at De Loo’s\r\ndeath by Giles Heron, who married Sir Thomas More’s second daughter,\r\n\r\nCecilia. Heron Hall was the seat of his family, and the property passed\r\ninto the possession of the Tyrrell family by the marriage of Sir John\r\nTyrrell with Margaret, daughter and heiress of Sir William Heron, of\r\nHeron, Kt. Quoting Walpole’s statement that the Heron picture “having\r\nbeen repainted, it is impossible to judge of its antiquity,” he goes on\r\nto say that this “appears to me to go very far in proof of the\r\ncorrectness of the opinion I have hazarded, as to who was the purchaser\r\nof the De Loo picture, for it is hardly to be credited that had this\r\n(Heron) picture been painted in oil colour it would have become so\r\ninjured as to require its being repainted to an extent to render it\r\n_impossible to judge of its antiquity_.” Mr. Winn thought that Holbein\r\nhimself must have sold the distemper version to De Loo—though why he\r\nshould do so it is not easy to imagine, as it is natural to suppose that\r\nSir Thomas More or some member of his family would have retained it—and\r\nthat the East Hendred picture, in Mr. Winn’s time at Barnborough Hall\r\n(see vol. i. p. 300), was the actual work painted by Holbein for the\r\nChancellor, either from the Basel sketch or the De Loo example. It is\r\nnot likely, he says, that Sir Thomas\r\n\r\n    “would have allowed the picture in _Distemper_ to be disposed of\r\n    to De Loo, ‘till he had secured a copy of it. I can hardly\r\n    therefore entertain a doubt that Sir Thomas _did_ possess one of\r\n    these large Family pieces, and that the picture at Barnborough\r\n    Hall is the identical one. John More had this picture conveyed\r\n    to Barnborough, when he took up his abode there on the death of\r\n    Mr. Cresacre, his wife’s father.”\r\n\r\nThe inference is that John More, as head of the family, inherited the\r\nversion of the Group expressly painted for his father. Mr. Winn says of\r\nthis picture that it is\r\n\r\n    “in the _number_ and _arrangement of the persons represented_ a\r\n    _facsimile_ of the _original sketch_, or drawing, and I deem it\r\n    far from improbable that it may be the picture which was\r\n    painted, by Holbein, for Sir Thomas; for although it is now in a\r\n    very deplorable state, caused by most unpardonable neglect, yet\r\n    there are parts which shew that the picture, in its original\r\n    state, was painted by no ‘prentice hand.’ It is now in a low\r\n    room panelled with oak, and has unfortunately been curtailed,\r\n    both in width, and depth, to fit it into the panel where it is\r\n    placed, and this may probably account for the absence of the\r\n    monogram of the painter, and the date. The present size of the\r\n    picture is length, ten feet; height, eight feet. The figures\r\n    represented are the size of life.”\r\n\r\nOf the Burford picture (see vol. i. pp. 301-2 and Pl. 76) he says:\r\n\r\n    “This picture was formerly in the possession of a branch of the\r\n    More family, who resided at Gobions, or Gubbins, not far from\r\n    Barnet, in Hertfordshire, for whom I have no doubt it was\r\n    painted, and probably by Zuccaro, as it bears the date 1593—some\r\n    of the figures are copied from one of the pictures already\r\n    alluded to (most likely from that at Barnborough); these are Sir\r\n    John More, Knt., Sir Thomas More, Knt., John More, Margaret\r\n    Roper, Cecilia Heron, Elizabeth Dancey, and Anne Cresacre. The\r\n    other figures (four in number, whose names I have given at page\r\n    12) are represented in the costume of the period in which the\r\n    picture was painted, viz. temp. Eliz. How this picture came into\r\n    the possession of the Lenthall family is not certain, but the\r\n    last possessor of it, of that name, told a relative of mine that\r\n    it had been purchased by their ancestor the Speaker Lenthall, on\r\n    the sale of Gobions and its contents.”\r\n\r\nAfter pointing out the differences between the Roper picture, the other\r\nversions, and the Basel sketch, Mr. Winn concludes by saying:\r\n\r\n    “There are other differences observable between the Sketch and\r\n    the Roper picture which though unimportant in themselves, yet\r\n    when considered in connection with those I have named, do I\r\n    think afford most satisfactory proof that the Roper picture is\r\n    _no copy_, but that it is, as Vertue asserts, an _original_\r\n    production by _Hans Holbein_.”\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, however, to follow Mr. Winn in every one of his\r\nconclusions, which would necessitate the belief that Holbein himself\r\npainted no less than three versions of the Family Group—the one in\r\ndistemper, which was sold by the artist to De Loo, and afterwards\r\npurchased by Giles Heron, now so injured that “it is impossible to judge\r\nof its authenticity”; the one in oil painted for Sir Thomas, which\r\nremained at Barnborough in the possession of John More and his\r\ndescendants, and has been cut down and subjected to “unpardonable\r\nneglect”; and the Roper picture now at Nostell Priory. It seems almost\r\ncertain that Holbein had no hand in the painting of the two first, and\r\nthat they are merely early copies or adaptations from the Nostell\r\npicture, though at the same time it should be pointed out that they\r\nfollow the Basel sketch more closely than the latter, and do not show,\r\nas it does, various alterations in the design, such as the introduction\r\nof the figure of the secretary Harris. This affords some support to the\r\ncontention that they are of earlier date, or copied from some earlier\r\nversion, than the Roper canvas. The Basel sketch would not be available\r\nfor the purpose, as it was taken with him by Holbein when he left\r\nEngland in 1528. Still, in spite of this, the fact remains that the\r\nNostell Priory version is the only one that has any pretensions to be\r\nregarded, even in a small part, as an original work by Holbein, and\r\nuntil further proof is forthcoming it is safest to conclude that\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MORE FAMILY GROUP]\r\n\r\nHolbein, after making his preliminary studies, began a large canvas\r\nwhich for some unknown reason was left by him in a very incomplete\r\nstate, and that Sir Thomas More had it finished by some other hand in\r\n1530, and that this picture was the one which came into De Loo’s\r\npossession, and is now at Nostell Priory.\r\n\r\nOne other point remains to be touched upon. Mr. Winn asserts that in\r\nVertue’s opinion the Roper picture is an original work by Holbein, and\r\nhe quotes in support of this statement from a manuscript by Vertue in\r\nhis possession which he bought at the Walpole sale. He gives several\r\nextracts from it, among them the following, upon which, apparently, he\r\nbases his contention:\r\n\r\n    “But the original painting by Holbein of this family (More) has\r\n    long been preserved by the family of Roper at Eltham in Kent,\r\n    and was till of late years there to be seen, but of late at\r\n    Greenwich in the King’s House in the Park inhabited by Sir John\r\n    Jennings, the family of Roper having desired leave to place it\r\n    there till their house at Eltham was rebuilt.”\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a second account of this picture by Vertue in his\r\ndiaries preserved in the British Museum (Add. MSS. 25071, f. 4), first\r\npublished by Mr. Lionel Cust in the _Burlington Magazine_, October 1912,\r\npp. 43-4; and in this memorandum, in which the picture is described in\r\ngreater detail, there is no suggestion made that it is an original work.\r\nMr. Winn’s manuscript appears to be rather earlier in date. In it Vertue\r\nspeaks of his examination as having been made at Greenwich (“I compared\r\nthe first sketch and the large picture together at Greenwich”—the “first\r\nsketch” he speaks of being Caroline Patin’s engraving of the Basel\r\ndrawing), but in the British Museum memorandum he states that he\r\nexamined it, at the request of the Earl of Oxford, after it had been\r\nremoved from Greenwich to Sir Roland Winn’s house in Soho Square, when\r\nhe “in a more particular manner observd that the picture differs from\r\nthe others, this seeming to be the most compleated.” He goes on to say:\r\n\r\n    “First that design at Basil, presented to Erasmus by Sr. Th.\r\n    More, I conceive to be the first sketch on lines on a sheet of\r\n    paper, or Holbein’s first draught, and in this large painting of\r\n    the Family containd the picture of Sir John Mores wife, a young\r\n    Lady to whom he was then lately married (and there is left out\r\n    Margaret Giggs) as in the design of the first, she only being a\r\n    companion to his daughters and a favorite of Mrs. More Sr.\r\n    Thomas Lady. Then there is also another person comeing in the\r\n    room with srole in his hand—whose name is ... Harisius ...\r\n    famulus, and behind a person setting reading on a desk—at bottom\r\n    are _two dogs_ favorites, probably put in afterwards by another\r\n    hand.... There really does not appear to be that certainty of\r\n    drawing, strength of colouring, as in many other pictures of\r\n    Holben. Therefore in the oppinion of several judges & professors\r\n    of painting it is doubtfull.”\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say:\r\n\r\n    “Upon another review of the Family peice of Sr. Thomas More—I\r\n    observe that the light & shade of the persons represented are\r\n    various, which is not consistent to nature nor practice in the\r\n    art of painting, for as it is a view of this Family represented\r\n    at once, the light ought to proceed from one point throughout\r\n    the whole picture, which it doth not but some of the figures\r\n    there represented, the light proceeds from the right side and\r\n    others from the left side. And the light on the face of Sr.\r\n    Thomas proceeds from the left and his father Sr. John is from\r\n    the right. And also the Lady of Sr. Tho. the light on her face\r\n    proceeds from the left so in several there is a disagrement of\r\n    light and shade.”\r\n\r\nVertue’s explanation of the painting of the picture is that Holbein,\r\nafter taking various portraits of members of the More family, drew, at\r\nSir Thomas’s request, a design for a big Family Group, but that before a\r\nstart could be made on the picture by the artist Henry VIII paid a visit\r\nto Chelsea, and was at once so captivated by the examples of Holbein’s\r\nart which he saw there that he carried the painter off to Court at once,\r\nand gave him so much to do that More’s commission had to be abandoned.\r\nSir Thomas, therefore, “after 1530” employed someone else to paint the\r\npicture from the original design and the finished family portraits,\r\n“perhaps, and not unlikely, some scholar of Holbein’s with his knowledge\r\nand consent,” this pupil “so forwarding it with as much skill as he was\r\nable ready for Holbein to go over again and review and finish it.” This\r\nwould be a matter of time, and during the progress of the work several\r\nalterations and additions were made, such as the introduction of the\r\nfigure of Harris, which figure, in Vertue’s opinion, showed “most\r\nvisible difference in painting and drawing,” so that it could not be\r\ncopied from any painting by Holbein, but was the original work of the\r\nassistant, who in this “ventured to show all his skill with full\r\nliberty.” In conclusion he remarks that “Raphael made many designs in\r\nsmall which were executed in large by his scholars, some before his\r\ndeath and some after,” and suggests that Holbein made the design for\r\nthis Family Group with the same intention—“Especially as it may be\r\nobservd none of these faces, hands coppyd from Holben’s painted pictures\r\nare not labouriously finishd, but left broad and light, fitly disposed\r\nto receive any improvments by Holbens hand—when, on the contrary, all\r\nthe still life in the picture, the jewells, ornaments, gold are highly\r\nfinished.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MORE FAMILY GROUP]\r\n\r\nSince the Nostell Priory picture was photographed, thanks to the\r\nkindness of Lord St. Oswald, for the purposes of this book, it has\r\nundergone a thorough and very careful cleaning, with the result that\r\nmany details, previously almost obscured, can now be seen quite clearly,\r\nwhile the general effect of the work as a whole has been greatly\r\nenhanced. As noted in the text (see vol. i. pp. 295-6), the chief points\r\nin which this picture differs from the Basel sketch is in the change of\r\nposition in the figures of Elizabeth Dancey and Margaret Gigs, and the\r\nintroduction of John Harris. Elizabeth Dancey, who now stands next to\r\nSir John More, is in exactly the same position and dress as in the\r\nsketch, whereas Margaret Gigs, who now forms the outer figure of the\r\ngroup on the left, is wearing a plain white head-dress, as in the\r\npreliminary study at Windsor, in place of the angular hood with black\r\nfall of the sketch; and she now stands upright, instead of stooping,\r\nwith her right hand resting on the book, indicating a passage with her\r\nforefinger. The secretary, John Harris, on the opposite side of the\r\npicture, has been brought from within the inner room, in which he was\r\nindicated with another person in the sketch, and now leans against one\r\nof the posts of the “porch” within the larger chamber, having a roll\r\nwith seals in his right hand; while his companion is shown standing at\r\nthe distant window, his back to the spectator, reading a book he holds\r\nin both hands. The cleaning of the picture has made clear the details of\r\nthe furniture and various objects placed about the room. The chief\r\nchanges in these have been already noted. The most important occurs in\r\nconnection with the large fitting or buffet on the left, which in the\r\nsketch appears as a sideboard reaching to the ceiling, with panels of\r\nlinen-work surmounted by a carved canopy. In the picture this has been\r\nchanged to a more simple fitting or table, such as is shown in “The Two\r\nAmbassadors,” covered with a Turkish cloth or carpet, the lower part of\r\nwhich forms a cupboard, with a bottle and glass visible through one of\r\nthe open doors. Upon this, some of the plate, including the dish and the\r\njug with the cloth over it, have been retained, but pushed into the\r\nbackground, with the two musical instruments placed in front of them,\r\nwhile to the single vase with flowers another has been added. One of\r\nthese holds lilies and carnations, and the other iris and columbines,\r\nwhile the window-ledge on the extreme right, behind Lady More, has now a\r\nlarge vase with flowers, instead of the jug, book, and flickering\r\ncandle. The clock is seen to be an astronomical one.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground, where rushes are roughly indicated, the small\r\nfootstool and the scattered books have been removed, their place being\r\ntaken by the two feebly-painted dogs. Happily, during the recent\r\ncleaning, the larger and more painful of these has been carefully\r\nremoved, to the very great advantage of the picture. Finally, Lady More\r\nno longer kneels at a _prie-dieu_, but is seated, and the chained\r\nmonkey, instead of scrambling against her skirts, is placed on its perch\r\nat her feet, looking at the spectator. The name and age of each sitter\r\nis written over the head or across the dress, the one over Margaret Gigs\r\nbeing in a different style of lettering from the others. This last-named\r\nis merely “Uxor Johannes Clements,” whereas in the East Hendred version,\r\nwhich seems to have been based more directly on the original design than\r\nthat at Nostell Priory, it is “Margareta Giga Mori Filiabus condiscipula\r\net cognata, A^o 22.” This has been taken to indicate that the East\r\nHendred picture was painted first, before the lady married John\r\nClements.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE PORTRAIT OF SIR THOMAS MORE. (Vol. i. pp. 303-4)\r\n\r\nThis celebrated portrait, which has been in the possession of the Huth\r\nfamily for so many years, is no longer in England. It was purchased last\r\nyear (1912) by Messrs. Knoedler, of Old Bond Street, London, and is now\r\nin the collection of Mr. H. C. Frick, of New York. It is deeply to be\r\nregretted that this fine example of Holbein’s art, and one of such great\r\nhistorical importance, has not found a final resting-place in the\r\nNational Gallery. According to report, the purchase price was £50,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n       (J) HOLBEIN’S RETURN TO ENGLAND IN 1532. (Vol. i. p. 352)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LORD ARUNDEL AND REMBRANDT]\r\n\r\nA letter from Erasmus to Bonifacius Amerbach, preserved among the Basel\r\nmanuscripts, appears to have reference to Holbein’s second journey to\r\nEngland, and at the same time to show that the relationships between the\r\nphilosopher and the painter were not, at that period at least, entirely\r\namicable ones. This letter, already referred to in Appendix (F), was\r\nfirst published by Dr. C. Chr. Bernoulli in the Basel _Nachrichten_, No.\r\n296, 1902, and is dated Freiburg, 10th April 1535, but the year-date, it\r\nis stated, is wrong, and should be 1533. The exact meaning of the letter\r\nis not quite clear, but in it Erasmus complains somewhat bitterly of\r\nfoolish behaviour and needless delay of more than a month in Antwerp on\r\nthe part of “Olpeius,” and of reprehensible conduct on his part towards\r\ncertain people in England to whom Erasmus had given him letters of\r\nintroduction. It seems almost certain that in the “Olpeius” of this\r\nletter Holbein is intended. The long stay in Antwerp of which Erasmus\r\ncomplains must have been in 1532, and apparently it was not until the\r\nfollowing spring that he heard of it, after receiving letters of\r\ncomplaint about the painter from one or more of his English\r\ncorrespondents. There is nothing in the letter to indicate in what way\r\nHolbein deceived these unnamed friends of Erasmus. The original text of\r\nthe letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Subornant te patronum, cui uni sciunt me nihil posse negare.\r\n    Sic Olpeius per te extorsit litteras in Angliam. At is resedit\r\n    Antuerpiæ supra mensem, diutius mansurus, si invenisset fatuos.\r\n    In Anglia decepit eos, quibus fuerat commendatus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  (K) LORD ARUNDEL AND REMBRANDT AS COLLECTORS OF HOLBEIN’S PICTURES.\r\n                            (Vol. ii. p. 66)\r\n\r\nSeveral important pictures by Holbein appear to have been in the\r\nNetherlands during the seventeenth century, and the Earl of Arundel,\r\nthrough his friends and agents, made serious efforts to add them to his\r\ncollection, though in some instances the price asked was too high for\r\nhim. In this search for examples of Holbein’s art he received\r\nconsiderable assistance from Sir Dudley Carleton, English minister at\r\nthe Hague, to whom the Earl wrote, on 17th September 1619: “I hear\r\nlikewise, by many ways how careful your lordship is to satisfy my\r\nfoolish curiosity in inquiring for the pieces of Holbein.” Two years\r\nlater, as already noted (see vol. i. p. 241), Carleton was endeavouring\r\nto obtain for him a picture by Holbein which may have been the Meyer\r\nMadonna; and in 1628 another fruitless attempt was made to purchase the\r\nportrait of Morette (see Vol. ii. p. 65-66). Again, on 25th April 1629,\r\nthe Earl wrote to Sir Henry Vane respecting “a book of Holbein.” In the\r\ncourse of this letter he says:\r\n\r\n    “I must likewise give you very many thanks for your care\r\n    concerning Bloome’s (Bloemaert’s) painting and book of Holbein,\r\n    and the King protests against any meddling with it, at 600_l._,\r\n    which he says cost him but 200_l._ For the drawings I hoped to\r\n    have had them for 30_l._, but rather than fail, as I told you, I\r\n    would go to 50_l._, but never think of 100_l._, nor 50_l._\r\n    offered without sure to have it; if he would let it come, upon\r\n    security to send it back, I should be glad, if not, let it\r\n    rest.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIR NICHOLAS POYNTZ]\r\n\r\nWhat this book was it is now impossible to say, but it cannot have been\r\nthe one containing the Windsor drawings, which came to the Arundel\r\nCollection from the Earl of Pembroke at about this time (see Sainsbury’s\r\n_Original Unpublished Papers_, &c., 1859, Nos. 44, 53, 55, and 57 in\r\nAppendix). It may have been the little book of twenty-two designs of the\r\nPassion of Christ which Lord Arundel showed to Sandrart (see Vol. ii. p.\r\n77).\r\n\r\nAnother seventeenth-century collector of pictures, the great painter\r\nRembrandt, was an admirer of Holbein’s work, and at the end of his life,\r\nwhen his fine collection had been sold and scattered for the benefit of\r\nhis creditors, and his monetary troubles were thick upon him, we find\r\nhim, nevertheless, offering the large sum of one thousand gulden for\r\nsome picture by the master. The document referring to this offer, dated\r\n15th October 1666, three years before Rembrandt died, is quoted by Dr.\r\nBode in his _Complete Works of Rembrandt_, 1906, vol. viii. pp. 296-7.\r\nIt is a letter written by Anna de Witt, of Dordrecht, in the course of\r\nwhich she says: “Whereas the picture is by one of the greatest painters\r\nof his time, Holbein, who also painted the picture of their ancestor;\r\nfor this Rembrandt offered 1000 gulden.” This ancestor was Willem\r\nSchijverts van Merode, and the picture appears to have been a votive\r\none, in which he was represented as the kneeling donor. Dr. Bode,\r\nhowever, suggests that in all probability the picture which Rembrandt\r\nwas said to be so anxious to possess was not by Holbein at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n       THE PORTRAITS OF SIR NICHOLAS POYNTZ. (Vol. ii. p. 71-72)\r\n\r\nHolbein’s original painting of Sir Nicholas Poyntz, from which various\r\ncopies were made, appears to be the picture in the collection of the\r\nEarl of Harrowby, at Sandon Hall, Stafford. This picture is in close\r\nagreement with the one described by Woltmann, which was exhibited in\r\nParis, at the Exposition du Palais Bourbon, in 1874, by the Marquis de\r\nla Rosière, and photographed on that occasion by Braun, but has since\r\ndisappeared. Lord Harrowby’s picture, which bears the same inscription\r\nand three-line motto in French as the examples mentioned in the text, is\r\na good and undoubtedly genuine work.\r\n\r\n\r\n          (L)

WHITEHALL. (Vol. ii. p. 185)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLBEIN IN WHITEHALL]\r\n\r\nIt was probably in Holbein’s painting-room in Whitehall that the\r\nincident occurred which set going the story told by Van Mander—a story\r\nfor which, no doubt, there was some foundation in truth—of Holbein’s\r\nviolence towards a nobleman who insisted upon forcing his way into the\r\nstudio when the artist was engaged upon the portrait of a lady, and who\r\nwas, in consequence, thrown downstairs by the infuriated painter. This\r\nstory Walpole tells as follows:\r\n\r\n    The writers of his life relate a story, which Vermander, his\r\n    first biographer, affirms came from Dr. Isely of Basil and from\r\n    Amerbach.... The story is, that one day as Holbein was privately\r\n    drawing some lady’s picture for the king, a great lord forced\r\n    himself into the chamber. Holbein threw him downstairs; the peer\r\n    cried out; Holbein bolted himself in, escaped over the top of\r\n    the house, and running directly to the king, fell on his knees,\r\n    and besought his Majesty to pardon him, without declaring the\r\n    offence. The king promised to forgive him if he would tell the\r\n    truth; but soon began to repent, saying he should not easily\r\n    overlook such insults, and bade him wait in the apartment till\r\n    he had learned more of the matter. Immediately arrived the lord\r\n    with his complaint, but sinking the provocation. At first the\r\n    monarch heard the story with temper, but broke out, reproaching\r\n    the nobleman with his want of truth, and adding, ‘You have not\r\n    to do with Holbein, but with me; I tell you, of seven peasants I\r\n    can make as many lords, but not one Holbein—begone, and\r\n    remember, that if ever you pretend to revenge yourself, I shall\r\n    look on any injury offered to the painter as done to myself.’\r\n    Henry’s behaviour is certainly the most probable part of the\r\n    story.” (See Walpole, _Anecdotes_, &c., ed. Wornum, vol. i. pp.\r\n    71-2.)\r\n\r\nWornum gives a more elaborate account of the adventure (_Holbein_, pp.\r\n319-20), and it is also introduced by Richard Lovelace into his poem\r\ncalled “Peinture: a Panegyrick to the Best Picture of Friendship, Mr.\r\nPet. Lilly” (Sir Peter Lely), included in _Lucasta_, first published in\r\n1649. The lines are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “When to our huffling Henry there complain’d\r\n     A grieved earl, that thought his honor stain’d:\r\n     Away (frown’d he), for your own safeties hast!\r\n     In one cheap hour ten coronets I’l cast:\r\n     But Holbeen’s noble and prodigious worth\r\n     Onely the pangs of an whole age brings forth.\r\n     Henry! a word so princely saving said,\r\n     It might new raise the ruins thou hast made.”\r\n             (See _Lucasta_, ed. W. Carew Hazlitt, 1864, pp. 225-6.)\r\n\r\nAnother seventeenth-century poet who makes reference to Holbein—in this\r\ninstance it is the Dance of Death which is in question—is Matthew Prior,\r\nwho, in his _Ode to the Memory of George Villiers_, says:\r\n\r\n      “Our term of life depends not on our deed,\r\n       Before our birth our funeral was decreed;\r\n       Nor aw’d by foresight, nor misled by chance,\r\n       Imperious Death directs the ebon lance,\r\n       Peoples great Henry’s tombs, and leads up Holbein’s Dance.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BARBER-SURGEONS’ PICTURE]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that Holbein’s painting-room at Whitehall was over\r\nthe so-called Holbein Gate. Numerous engravings of this gate were made\r\nin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and reproductions of\r\nseveral of these will be found in _Whitehall: Historical and\r\nArchitectural Notes_ (Portfolio Monograph), by W. J. Loftie, F.S.A.,\r\n1895, and in _The Old Royal Palace of Whitehall_, by Dr. Edgar Sheppard,\r\n1901. Mr. Loftie reproduces an engraving of Whitehall showing the Gate\r\nafter a drawing by Hollar in the Pepysian Library, Cambridge; the\r\n“Banqueting Hall, Holbein’s Gate, and Treasury,” from the engraving by\r\nJ. Silvestre, 1640; “Whitehall in 1724,” from the engraving by J. Kip;\r\n“Holbein’s Gate,” from an engraving by G. Vertue, 1725; and “Whitehall,\r\nfrom King Street,” from an engraving by R. Godfrey, 1775, after a\r\ndrawing by T. Sandby, R.A. Dr. Sheppard reproduces the engraving after\r\nHollar, and the Kip and Vertue engravings, and also “Whitehall,” from a\r\npicture by Canaletto in the possession of the Duke of Buccleuch; and “A\r\nView of Whitehall with the Holbein Gateway,” from a drawing by Paul\r\nSandby in the possession of Mr. E. Gardner.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE BARBER-SURGEONS’ PICTURE. (Vol. ii. p. 294)\r\n\r\nA further proof of the high value placed upon this picture by the\r\nCompany in earlier days is to be found in John Strype’s additions to\r\nJohn Stow’s _Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster_, in the\r\nfolio edition published in 1720. He says (Book iii. p. 128), in speaking\r\nof “Barber-Chirurgeons’ Hall”:—“In this Hall also is a large and very\r\ncurious Piece of K. Henry VIII reaching the Chirurgeons their Charter;\r\nwith many other Persons of the said Company delineated. It is said to be\r\ndone by _Hans Holben_; and some say, as many Broad Pieces have been\r\noffered for the purchase of it as would cover it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         SUMMARY LIST OF HOLBEIN’S CHIEF PICTURES AND PORTRAITS\r\n\r\n        (_Alphabetically arranged under the various countries_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list of Holbein’s pictures and portraits in public and\r\nprivate collections in England and abroad consists merely of the title\r\nof each work, the date whenever known, and the number in Woltmann’s\r\nlist, together with a reference to the page or pages and the plates in\r\nthe present book in which the particular picture is described or\r\nreproduced. Holbein’s very numerous drawings, studies, and designs are\r\nnot included. For these the reader must be referred to the second volume\r\nof Dr. Woltmann’s book, and, more particularly, to the important\r\npublication, now in course of issue, under the editorship of Dr. Paul\r\nGanz, which is to include a facsimile reproduction of every one of the\r\nmaster’s drawings. Nor does this list include Holbein’s woodcuts and\r\nbook illustrations, for which the student is referred to Woltmann,\r\nPassavant, Butsch, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AMERICA\r\n\r\n                   BOSTON: COLLECTION OF MRS.
